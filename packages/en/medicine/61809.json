vaccination. They will tell you\r\nit has stopped smallpox and does no harm, and if you venture to\r\nquestion either assertion you are set down as an abettor of “those\r\nignorant and fanatical anti-vaccinators.” If undeterred you inquire\r\nwhen smallpox was stopped, and which is the harmless variety of\r\nvaccination, you will probably be told that these are medical\r\nquestions, whilst the facts are indisputable; the answer running in\r\nthe line of Old Kaspar’s to Little Peterkin, inquisitive as to the\r\ngood of Blenheim--\r\n\r\n      Why that I cannot tell, said he,\r\n      But ’twas a famous victory.\r\n\r\nI am not complaining of this attitude of mind. We all accept more\r\nor less on bare authority. In the multiplicity and unsearchableness\r\nof knowledge, it is unavoidable. Some years ago a venerable friend\r\nurged me to write against vaccination, which, he said, was working\r\nendless mischief to the public health. He would have the book\r\npublished, and provide whatever was requisite for my satisfaction.\r\nI pleaded prior engagements, and turned the conversation, thinking\r\nhow sad it was that one so good, and, in other respects, so\r\nenlightened should be subject to so strange an illusion--I, then,\r\ntaking vaccination on trust as one of the numerous blessings\r\nconferred upon mankind in the course of the present century.\r\n\r\nI am therefore disposed to make large allowance for the credulous\r\nattitude of the public toward vaccination whilst at the same\r\ntime insisting on its correction; and for this reason especially,\r\nthat vaccination is no longer a matter of private concern. We are\r\nfree to entertain what notions we please, but if we proceed to\r\nenforce them on unbelievers, we cannot complain if we are required\r\nto answer for our aggression or encounter rough usage. Enforced\r\nby the law of England, vaccination is related to the life and\r\nintelligence of every citizen, and it is consequently vain to claim\r\nfor it exemption from vulgar discussion. Apart from its compulsory\r\ninfliction, vaccination might be and remain an esoteric rite, the\r\nvery mystery of mysteries; but with compulsion the privilege of\r\nsanctity is impossible.\r\n\r\n\r\nVARIOLATION.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that beliefs and observances in themselves most\r\nirrational wear a different aspect when viewed in the light of\r\ntheir origin and history. It is so with vaccination. Had it\r\ncome upon the world as we know it, with failure and disaster,\r\nequivocation and apology, rejection would have been inevitable; but\r\nwhen we turn to the past we discover that our _damnosa hæreditas_\r\nhas a tradition that goes far to account for, if not to excuse, the\r\nfolly which remains.\r\n\r\nVaccination was the successor of Inoculation (or, more precisely,\r\nVariolation), entering into a possession already acquired in the\r\nhuman mind.\r\n\r\nIt had been observed from of old that some forms of disease rarely\r\nrecur in the same person in a lifetime; and thus when scarlet\r\nfever, or measles, or smallpox broke out in a family, it was\r\nconsidered prudent to let the disease have its course, and thereby\r\nobtain immunity from fear of future infection.\r\n\r\nIt was this confidence, that smallpox once undergone was finally\r\ndisposed of, that was the justification of the practice of\r\ninoculating the disease when introduced from the East in the\r\nfirst quarter of last century. Inasmuch, it was argued, as none\r\ncan have smallpox more than once, why not induce it artificially,\r\nand pass through the illness at a convenient season? But Nature,\r\nthough compliant, does not always accept the course we ingeniously\r\nprescribe for her. Smallpox as naturally developed (so to speak) is\r\na crisis of impurity in the blood, and if the requisite conditions\r\nare absent, it cannot be adequately excited. Hence variolation\r\nwas an uncertain and hazardous operation. It took with some and\r\nwas indistinguishable from an attack of ordinary smallpox; it\r\ntook partially, or not at all with others; and the operation was\r\nfrequently followed by malaise, disorders of the skin, and grave\r\nconstitutional derangements. Nor were the variolated secure from\r\nsmallpox. They occasionally had smallpox with their neighbours,\r\nand then it was said, “There must have been some mistake about the\r\ninoculation; for it is impossible that anyone can be successfully\r\ninoculated and have smallpox.” Further, the variolated, while\r\nlabouring under the induced malady, conveyed the disease to their\r\nattendants and visitors; and thus smallpox was propagated by the\r\nmeans intended to avert it.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRECURSOR OF VACCINATION.\r\n\r\nAt the close of last century, variolation had become the custom\r\nof the upper and middle classes of England. The trouble and the\r\nperil were disliked, but were accepted in the name of duty. The\r\nvariolation of their children was an anxiety that weighed like\r\nlead on the hearts of affectionate parents; and glad and grateful\r\nthey were when the operation was accomplished without serious\r\nmishap. Patients designed for variolation were dieted, purged,\r\nand bled; and smallpox from sufferers of sound constitution was\r\ndiligently inquired for. Mild smallpox was in great demand and\r\nwas propagated from arm to arm. When Dr. Dimsdale operated on the\r\nEmpress Catharine he did not venture to convey smallpox direct to\r\nthe imperial person. He looked out a case of “benign smallpox” with\r\nwhich he inoculated a strong young man, and from the young man the\r\nEmpress. Unless we realise the inconveniences, the uncertainties,\r\nthe disasters and the horrors of the practice of variolation,\r\nalbeit minimised, excused and denied by its professors, we can\r\nnever understand the enthusiasm with which vaccination was received\r\nas its substitute. The promise conveyed in vaccination was a relief\r\ninexpressible, bearing with it a show of reason that was well nigh\r\nirresistible. The argument ran thus: No one can have smallpox\r\ntwice, and the mildest attack is as protective from subsequent\r\nattack as the severest. Therefore it is that in inoculation with\r\nsmallpox we find security. But inoculation with smallpox is an\r\nuncertain operation with dangerous issues. Here, however, in cowpox\r\nis discovered a mild variety of smallpox, which may be inoculated\r\nwith perfect ease, and with no possibility of harm. And inasmuch\r\nas the mildest smallpox is as preventive of future smallpox as the\r\nseverest, it follows that this gentle cowpox must serve as a full\r\nequivalent for smallpox itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMMEDIATE TRIUMPH OF VACCINATION.\r\n\r\nIt was in this plausible shape that vaccination had an immediate\r\ntriumph. The way was made straight for it and every difficulty\r\nremoved by the existing practice of variolation. Dr. W. B.\r\nCarpenter says that vaccination was more strenuously resisted\r\nat the beginning of the century than it is at this day. He is\r\ncompletely mistaken. Vaccination came upon a generation prepared\r\nfor it--which saw in it a prescription in full accord with\r\ncommon-sense. The entire medical profession, with a few exceptions,\r\nthe King, Queen and court, were converted straight off, and\r\nparliament and society followed suit. It was, I confess, a natural\r\ndevelopment of opinion; and we need have little doubt that had we\r\nlived in those days we should have found ourselves shouting with\r\nthe genteel mob. The limited resistance offered to vaccination\r\nwas not based on physiological or sanitary science: such science\r\ndid not then exist. It was the resistance of variolators who\r\nwere satisfied with the established practice and resented its\r\ndisturbance; professing at the same time immeasurable horror at the\r\nprofanation to humanity by infection with bovine disease. Whilst\r\nwe have no reason to identify ourselves with that resistance,\r\nwe have to recognise the service rendered by the variolators in\r\nobserving the results of vaccination--the persistency with which\r\nthey traced and exposed its failure to prevent smallpox and the\r\ninjuries and deaths it caused. So far as the maintenance of\r\nvariolous inoculation was concerned, they fought a losing battle;\r\nbut they drove the vaccinators from post to post (cursed while they\r\ndid so as malignant false witnesses possessed of the devil) and at\r\nlast compelled the admission that their infallible preventive could\r\nnot be guaranteed to prevent, but only to make smallpox milder--a\r\nsafe assertion because unverifiable, as disputable as indisputable\r\nin particular instances.\r\n\r\n\r\nJENNER’S PROCEDURE.\r\n\r\nAbout the matter of this prophylactic there was from the first a\r\ncurious confusion which continues to this day.\r\n\r\nJenner was a country doctor at Berkeley in Gloucestershire, a dairy\r\ncountry, where the maids believed that if they caught cowpox in\r\nmilking they could never afterwards catch smallpox. Jenner when a\r\nyoung man was inclined to accept the dairymaids’ faith; but when\r\nhe discussed it with his medical acquaintance, they ridiculed him.\r\nThey said, “We know that such is the dairymaids’ faith, but we also\r\nknow that it is untrue; for we know dairymaids who have had cowpox,\r\nand afterwards had smallpox notwithstanding their cowpox.” Jenner\r\nwas convinced and said no more about cowpox.\r\n\r\nTo this point let me draw special attention. No man knew better\r\nthan Jenner that cowpox as cowpox was no preventive of smallpox.\r\n\r\nToward middle-life he had what he conceived to be a happy thought.\r\nCowpox as cowpox he had dismissed as impracticable; but there was\r\na variety of cowpox which he resolved to recommend.\r\n\r\nCows in Gloucestershire were milked by men as well as by women; and\r\nmen would sometimes milk cows with hands foul from dressing the\r\nheels of horses afflicted with what was called _grease_. With this\r\n_grease_ they infected the cows, and the pox which followed was\r\npronounced by Jenner to have all the virtue against smallpox which\r\nthe dairymaids claimed for cowpox.\r\n\r\n\r\nHORSEGREASE COWPOX.\r\n\r\nAccording to Jenner, then, the dairymaids were right, and they were\r\nwrong. They were right when the pox they caught was derived from\r\nthe horse through the cow; they were wrong when the pox they caught\r\noriginated on the cow without the horse. He thus discriminated a\r\ndouble pox--cowpox of no efficacy against smallpox, and horsegrease\r\ncowpox of sure efficacy.\r\n\r\nFurther, in this connection, it is to be observed, that farriers\r\nbelieved that when they got poisoned in handling horses with greasy\r\nheels, they too, like the dairymaids, were safe from smallpox.\r\n\r\nIt is not therefore for cowpox, but for horsegrease cowpox that\r\nJenner is answerable. In cowpox he had not, and could have no faith.\r\n\r\nIn 1798 Jenner published his famous _Inquiry_, a treatise much more\r\nspoken of than read, wherein he distinctly set forth the origin of\r\nhis chosen prophylactic. It was _not_, I repeat, cowpox: _it was\r\nhorsegrease cowpox_. He carefully discriminated it from spontaneous\r\ncowpox, which, he said, had no protective virtue, being attended\r\nwith no inflammation and erysipelas, the essential sequences of\r\ninoculation with effective virus.\r\n\r\n\r\nREJECTION OF JENNER’S PRESCRIPTION.\r\n\r\nI have said that the world gave a cordial and unhesitating welcome\r\nto Jenner’s revelation, but the observation requires a startling\r\nqualification. Jenner’s revelation as conveyed in his _Inquiry_\r\nwas summarily and ignominiously rejected--was absolutely rejected.\r\nI wish to emphasise this point. Jenner published his _Inquiry_ in\r\norder to recommend horsegrease cowpox, and what I have to say is,\r\nthat the public declined to have anything to do with horsegrease\r\ncowpox. The origin of cowpox in horsegrease was scouted as an\r\nintolerable origin. It was disgusting. Why a diseased secretion\r\nfrom horses’ heels should be more repulsive than a similar\r\nsecretion from cows’ teats was not explained; but, as we all know,\r\nthere is no accounting for tastes. Various attempts were made to\r\nverify Jenner’s prescription by inoculating cows with horsegrease,\r\nbut they ended in failure--fortunately, it was said, in failure;\r\nfor as Dr. Pearson (chief among primitive vaccinators) observed,\r\n“The very name of horsegrease was like to have damned the whole\r\nthing.” What did Jenner do under these circumstances? Did he\r\nconfront the public and assert the efficacy of horsegrease cowpox?\r\nNot he. He wanted money. He saw how the wind was blowing. He said\r\nnot another word about horsegrease cowpox; and as the public\r\nwere eager at any price to escape from the nuisance of smallpox\r\ninoculation, and disposed to substitute cowpox as a harmless\r\nsubstitute, why then he resolved to go in for cowpox, and pose as\r\nits discoverer and promoter.\r\n\r\n\r\nJENNER’S TRANSFORMATION.\r\n\r\nI am not making what is called a constructive charge against\r\nJenner, but simply setting forth plain, undeniable matter-of-fact.\r\nI ask any one in doubt as to what I say to read Jenner’s _Inquiry_,\r\npublished in 1798, the prescription of which is horsegrease cowpox,\r\nand the condemnation of cowpox. Turn then to his petition for\r\nlargess, addressed to the House of Commons in 1802, and what do we\r\nfind? Not one word about horsegrease cowpox, but this audacious\r\nassertion:--\r\n\r\n“That your Petitioner has discovered that a disease which\r\noccasionally exists in a particular form among cattle, known by\r\nname of Cowpox, admits of being inoculated on the human frame\r\nwith the most perfect ease and safety, and is attended with the\r\nsingularly beneficial effect of rendering through life the person\r\nso inoculated perfectly secure from the infection of Smallpox.”\r\n\r\nWhy, that was not Jenner’s discovery! It was the notion of the\r\ndairymaids, and, so far as concerned spontaneous cowpox, was known\r\nby Jenner to be untrue. Yet, strange to say, the claim was in a\r\nmeasure allowed by the House of Commons, and £10,000 awarded to the\r\nimposter, and subsequently £20,000 in 1807.\r\n\r\n\r\nHORSEGREASE COWPOX KEPT OUT OF SIGHT.\r\n\r\nAs evidence of how completely Jenner’s prescription of horsegrease\r\ncowpox was put out of sight, I may refer to the treatise of Dr.\r\nWillan _On Vaccine Inoculation_, published in 1806, wherein\r\nall that was thought important concerning the new practice was\r\nset forth; and although Jenner was freely cited, yet neither\r\nhorsegrease nor horsegrease cowpox was referred to from the\r\nfirst page to the last. Instead, cowpox, after the fancy of the\r\ndairymaids, was exalted as the true prophylactic, apparently\r\nwithout a suspicion of its questionable character.\r\n\r\nAs I have said, Jenner not only offered no resistance to this\r\namazing transformation, but conformed to it, and assumed the issue\r\nas his own. Since the public preferred cowpox to horsegrease\r\ncowpox, he saw no reason why he should object, especially as the\r\nsame foolish public lusted after some one to worship for their\r\ndeliverance from the plague of variolation. The world resounded\r\nwith praises of the immortal Jenner, the saviour of mankind from\r\nsmallpox. Enveloped in the smoke of such incense, it is scarcely\r\nsurprising that the idol came to believe that his worshippers knew\r\nhim better than he did himself.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPURIOUS COWPOX.\r\n\r\nThe promise of vaccination, its absolute security and harmlessness,\r\nwas speedily belied. The vaccinated caught smallpox; they fell\r\nsick after the operation; they were afflicted with eruptions and\r\nswellings; they died. These mishaps were at first denied--stoutly\r\ndenied; and when denial was no longer possible, it was attempted\r\nto explain them away. The cowpox used could not have been genuine\r\ncowpox, but spurious; and for awhile spurious cowpox did yeoman’s\r\nservice in the way of apology; but by-and-by the excuse began to\r\nwork more harm than good. Mishaps were so numerous that people\r\nbecame afraid of this omnipresent spurious cowpox, and to ask what\r\nit was, and how it could be avoided. How can there be spurious\r\npox? Whoever heard of spurious disease? Milkmen vend spurious\r\nmilk, grocers spurious sugar, smashers spurious coin; but surely\r\ncows are not to be numbered with such malefactors as producers\r\nof spurious pox! The thing was absurd on its face, and absurd\r\nit proved. When Jenner was under examination by a committee of\r\nthe College of Physicians in 1806, he was pressed hard for a\r\ndefinition of spurious cowpox, when he “owned up.” He knew nothing\r\nof spurious cowpox. The words had been employed, not to describe\r\nany irregularity on the part of the cow, but certain irregularities\r\nin the action of cowpox on the part of the vaccinated: which was\r\nto say that when the vaccinated recovered creditably and did not\r\ncatch smallpox, the cowpox was genuine; but when the sequences were\r\notherwise, why then it was spurious! Ingenious and convenient, was\r\nit not?\r\n\r\n\r\nHORSE VIRUS VINDICATED.\r\n\r\nReverting to Jenner’s suppression of the origin of cowpox in\r\nhorsegrease, it may be suggested that he had changed his mind: but\r\nhe had not changed his mind. As observed, various attempts were\r\nmade to inoculate cows with horsegrease, and that these attempts\r\nwere failures; but subsequent attempts were successful. Tanner,\r\na veterinarian, of Rockhampton, Gloucestershire, succeeded to\r\nJenner’s complete satisfaction. Dr. Loy of Whitby dispensed with\r\nthe cow altogether, and inoculated with horsegrease, or horsepox,\r\nproducing vesicles identical with those of cowpox. The great\r\nsuccess, however, in this line was reserved for Sacco of Milan.\r\nFrom the hand of a coachman poisoned with horsegrease he inoculated\r\nnine children, and from the virus thus engendered operated on every\r\nside. Writing to Jenner in 1803, Sacco said--“It is now admitted\r\nand settled that grease is the cause of vaccine, and we cannot too\r\nsoon alter the designation to equine.” De Carro of Vienna received\r\nthis equine from Sacco, and used it so freely and successfully\r\namong the Viennese, that, in his own words, it became impossible to\r\nsay which of the citizens were equinated and which vaccinated.\r\n\r\nWhat did Jenner make of these confirmations? He was adjudged\r\nmistaken in asserting that the cowpox good against smallpox was\r\nderived from horsegrease. Did he appeal with triumph to the\r\nevidence of Sacco, and say, “You thought me wrong, but see, I was\r\nright!” Not he. He kept silence. He consented to be treated as in\r\nerror. He stood by and allowed cowpox to be used in which he had\r\nno confidence whatever. Nay more. He consented to be rewarded and\r\nhonoured as the discoverer of a pox (which he did not discover) in\r\nwhich he was without faith, and had at the outset of his career\r\nexpressly rejected and condemned. He recognised that it was\r\nexpedient that the connection between horsegrease and cowpox should\r\nbe denied. He had his bill to settle with the English people, and\r\nit was not for him to make difficulties. When, however, he had\r\nobtained all he could expect from public favour, and had got clear\r\nof London and the oppression of its savants, why then he resumed\r\nthe expression of his original opinion; and still further, like\r\nSacco of Milan, he dispensed with the cow, and inoculated straight\r\nfrom the horse. He supplied the National Vaccine Establishment with\r\nhorse virus; he sent it to Edinburgh; he distributed it among his\r\nmedical acquaintances; he described it as “the true and genuine\r\nlife-preserving fluid.” What more need I say? Such was Jenner; such\r\nwere his tactics; and whoever assumes his defence will assume a\r\ntask in which he is not to be envied.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHICH SHALL IT BE?\r\n\r\nJenner died in 1823, and at that date three kinds of virus were in\r\nuse; first, cowpox from horsegrease or horsepox; second, cowpox;\r\nthird, horsepox. These of course were subject to inscrutable\r\nmodification in transmission from arm to arm: it is the distinct\r\nsources we have to recognise. A patient intent on vaccination might\r\nhave said to himself, Which shall it be? Shall I be cowpoxed? or,\r\nshall I be horsepoxed? or, shall I be horsepoxed cowpoxed? How such\r\nan inquirer would have been answered had he set his perplexity\r\nbefore his medical adviser, I can only conjecture. Probably he\r\nwould have been rebuked for his intrusion into matters outside\r\nhis province. The little girl who quenched the scepticism of her\r\ncomrade with the dictum, “It is so, for ma says so; and if it isn’t\r\nso, it is so, if ma says so,” illustrates the manner of rebuff\r\nadministered to those who pry into professional mysteries. It is\r\nfor you to pay and for us to think is a formula by no means limited\r\nto ecclesiastics.\r\n\r\n\r\nSMALLPOX COWPOX.\r\n\r\nJenner was pleased to describe cowpox as a mild form of smallpox;\r\nbut for what reason, outside his pleasure, he did not explain.\r\nNevertheless the suggestion has borne fruit. When virus has fallen\r\nshort, it has been asked, Why, if cowpox be mild smallpox, should\r\nnot cows be inoculated with smallpox, and a crop of virus be\r\nraised? Various such attempts have been made, in which Mr. Badcock\r\nof Brighton has been especially distinguished. Mr. John Simon,\r\nwriting in 1857, said, “Mr. Badcock, from 1840 to the present time,\r\nhas again and again derived fresh stocks of vaccine lymph from cows\r\nartificially infected by him; having vaccinated with such lymph\r\nmore than 14,000 persons, and having forwarded supplies of it to\r\nmore than 400 medical practitioners.” When it is remembered that\r\nvirus for half a dozen or more vaccinations is taken from a single\r\narm, and that this process of reproduction is repeated every week,\r\nsome idea may be formed of the extent to which this smallpox cowpox\r\nhas been diffused over the country.\r\n\r\nThe original assertion that vaccination conferred life-long\r\nimmunity from smallpox was unwillingly abandoned under stress\r\nof experience, until no respectable practitioner pretended that\r\nthe rite afforded more than a partial or temporary security. In\r\npromotion of smallpox cowpox, however, Jenner’s most extravagant\r\nclaims were revived. In Mr. Simon’s words, for the recipient of\r\nsmallpox cowpox, “Neither renewed vaccination, nor inoculation with\r\nsmallpox, nor the closest contact and co-habitation with smallpox\r\npatients, will occasion him to betray any remnant of susceptibility\r\nto infection.” Untrue even of variolation, it is unnecessary to\r\ncontrovert such a figment: it suffices to place it on record.\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis was, that smallpox inoculated on the cow lost\r\nsomewhat of its virulence; but if so, why should not such cowpox\r\ninoculated on man resume its virulence? We are apt to forget that\r\nthe nature of things is not controlled by our wishes, and that\r\nour interest in the conversion of smallpox into cowpox, and its\r\nmaintenance as cowpox, is no warrant for fulfilment. I may also\r\nremark that though smallpox cowpox has entered so largely into\r\ncurrency, there is no evidence to what extent it has displaced\r\nthe preceding issues of horsegrease cowpox, cowpox and horsepox.\r\nSo far as we know, they are all existent in the common blood,\r\nindistinguishable, the stronger surviving, the weaker dying out:\r\nnobody knows, nor can know.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONDEMNATION OF SMALLPOX COWPOX.\r\n\r\nThat smallpox cowpox is in any sense cowpox is, however, widely\r\ndisputed, much confidence being placed in the researches of the\r\nLyons Commission in 1855, presided over by M. Chaveau. This\r\nCommission, says Dr. Charles Cameron, “proved incontestably that\r\nsmallpox can no more be converted into cowpox by passing it\r\nthrough a cow than by stunting an oak it can be converted into a\r\ngooseberry bush.” Cowpox, it is held, is a disease of the cow, with\r\nno relation to smallpox. The vesicles of each may be apparently\r\nidentical, as are the vesicles excited by the application of tartar\r\nemetic; but that is no proof of essential identity. According to\r\nDr. George Wyld, “Smallpox inoculation of the heifer produces not\r\nvaccinia, but a modified smallpox, capable of spreading smallpox\r\namong human beings by infection;” and Dr. Cameron boldly attributes\r\nthe recent increase of smallpox to the use of smallpox cowpox for\r\nvaccination.\r\n\r\nNor is Dr. Cameron singular in this opinion. Some time ago, the\r\nGalway Guardians ran short of virus for vaccination, when it was\r\nproposed to inoculate a calf with smallpox. As soon as the Local\r\nGovernment Board in Dublin became aware of the project, it was\r\nforbidden. Why? Here is the deliverance of the Secretary--“Because\r\nsmallpox virus taken from the calf would communicate that\r\ndisease to the human subject, and be thereby a fertile source of\r\npropagating the disease; and would, moreover, render the operator\r\nliable to prosecution under the Act prohibiting inoculation with\r\nsmallpox.” Thus the virus current in England, and credited with\r\nmiraculous virtue by Simon, is denounced as dangerous and its use\r\nunlawful in Ireland!\r\n\r\n\r\nCOWPOX REVIVED.\r\n\r\nThe constant disasters of vaccination, the certain and suspected\r\ncommunication of human diseases with the virus propagated from arm\r\nto arm, have induced a wide resort to cowpox under the designation\r\nof “animal vaccination,” in contempt of the fact that disease in\r\ncattle is as rife as among men, and inoculable. Still the dread of\r\nthe invaccination of syphilis is so intense, and so justifiable,\r\nthat other risks are encountered if that may be avoided.\r\n\r\nThis cowpox is commended as “pure lymph from the calf,” a sweet\r\nperiphrase with a savour of Daphne and Chloe, of Flora and the\r\ncountry green--a periphrase used in craft or ignorance, “pure\r\nlymph” being as incapable of producing vaccinia as pure milk or\r\npure saliva. The prescription takes us back to Jenner’s time\r\nand Jenner’s procedure. As has been said, the Gloucestershire\r\ndairymaids believed that after cowpox they were safe from smallpox,\r\nand that Jenner was much impressed with their belief until he\r\ndiscovered that it was untrue. Had he found it true, he might\r\nhave advertised the prophylactic thirty years in advance of the\r\npublication of his _Inquiry_; but if anything was certain, this\r\nwas certain, that cowpox did not avert smallpox. Satisfied that\r\ncowpox _per se_ was of no avail against smallpox, he defined a\r\nvariety of cowpox generated by the application of horsegrease, to\r\nwhich he was pleased to ascribe sovereign efficacy. Why, I ask,\r\ndid he discriminate and prescribe that variety of cowpox if cowpox\r\n_per se_ was effective? The question answers itself. I will not\r\nsay the cowpoxers treat Jenner’s evidence with disrespect; for\r\nsuch is their ignorance, that I question if they are aware of\r\nits existence; moreover, that which is undesirable to know, is\r\ninstinctively avoided and kept out of sight. They recommend their\r\n“lymph” as wonderfully mild, being attended with no erysipelas, the\r\npest of arm-to-arm vaccination--a description that tallies exactly\r\nwith Jenner’s of impotent cowpox. “The pustules,” says Jenner, “are\r\nof a much milder nature” than those of horsegrease cowpox. “_No\r\nerysipelas attends them_, and they are incapable of producing any\r\nspecific effect on the human constitution.”\r\n\r\n\r\nA COWPOX CHARLATAN.\r\n\r\nYet, incredible as it may appear, it is with the praise of this\r\nimpotent cowpox, attended with no erysipelas, that the public\r\nhave been deafened, and for which the most extravagant assertions\r\nare made. Dr. Martin, one of the chief producers and vendors of\r\nthe article, appeared at the British Medical Association in 1881,\r\nsaying, “I am called upon at times, at the very shortest notice,\r\nto vaccinate whole cities; and when I left America, I had just\r\ncompleted the vaccination of the city of New Haven. The custom\r\nis to send for me, or my son, wherever smallpox breaks out, with\r\norders to vaccinate at once the entire population of the city,\r\ntown, or neighbourhood. It is done immediately, the result being\r\nthat an epidemic is completely stopped in a week.”\r\n\r\nThus spoke the charlatan, with the acquiescence of the medical\r\nassembly. When churchmen deplore the scepticism of the age, and\r\nthe decay of faith, it is to be observed that the habit of mind is\r\nlimited to certain modes of opinion, and that in general we are\r\nas credulous as ever. Human nature in its structure is curiously\r\nimmutable. Wherein is the advantage to disbelieve in witchcraft and\r\nto believe that epidemics of smallpox can be stopped with cowpox?\r\n\r\n\r\nA DECOROUS UNANIMITY.\r\n\r\nSuch are the leading varieties of virus used for\r\nvaccination--starting with Jenner’s horsegrease cowpox, then\r\ncowpox, then horsepox, then smallpox cowpox, and finishing with\r\ncowpox revived; each of them inscrutably modified in transit\r\nfrom child to child and from beast to beast. We are continually\r\nhearing of miracles wrought by vaccination in the past and\r\npresent--especially the past, at home and abroad--especially\r\nabroad, the assumption being that vaccination is, and has been,\r\neverywhere the same. On the contrary, the condition precedent to\r\nserious consideration of any vaccine miracle is a definition of\r\nthe variety of vaccination practised. It is, we admit, convenient\r\nfor the administrators of the rite that it should pass for\r\nuniform, however multiform; for the practice has become a great\r\nand lucrative business--a world-wide poll-tax; and whatever the\r\ninternal differences of the priesthood, it is their obvious\r\ninterest to exhibit a decorous unanimity in presence of their\r\ncustomers. Hence the uneasiness recently excited by indiscreet\r\nadvocates of “pure lymph from the calf” has been judiciously\r\nallayed, not by resistance, but by concession and damnation with\r\nfaint praise; the commercial instinct dictating caution, for if the\r\npublic did get behind the professional screen, and discovered the\r\nmysteries of pox, what might not befall the craft of vaccination!\r\n\r\n\r\nJENNER’S SUCCESSIVE DISCLAIMERS.\r\n\r\nThe story of vaccination is a story of failures, and as each\r\nfailure has become manifest, it has been more or less artfully\r\napologised for.\r\n\r\nMuch is given to assurance. People like infallible prescriptions.\r\nThey prefer an unequivocal lie to an equivocal answer. This\r\nadventurers understand, and discourse accordingly. Hence when\r\nJenner solicited Parliament for largess, he did so in no doubtful\r\nterms. He boldly declared that cowpox was “inoculated on the human\r\nframe with the most perfect ease and safety,” and was “attended\r\nwith the singularly beneficial effect of rendering through life\r\nthe person so inoculated perfectly secure from the infection of\r\nsmallpox.” Again he said, “The human frame, when once it has felt\r\nthe influence of genuine cowpox, is never afterwards, at any period\r\nof its existence, assailable by smallpox.”\r\n\r\nIt is needless to point out that Jenner was without warrant for his\r\nassertions. His experience did not cover more than a few years;\r\nand he could not, therefore, know that his specific would secure\r\nits subjects from smallpox for life. He believed, or affected to\r\nbelieve, his own assurance, and assurance being infectious, it\r\nwidely spread. The inoculation of cowpox became fashionable among\r\nbusybodies, male and female. Ladies especially were numbered among\r\nJenner’s favourites and experts, operating, as he described, “with\r\na light hand.” Cobbett relates, “Gentlemen and ladies made the\r\nbeastly commodity a pocket companion; and if a cottager’s child\r\nwere seen by them on a common (in Hampshire at least), and did not\r\nquickly take to its heels, it was certain to carry off more or less\r\nof the disease of the cow.”\r\n\r\nIt so happened that prior to the introduction of vaccination, a\r\nmarked decline in the prevalence of smallpox had set in, and for\r\nthe continuance of this decline the vaccinators took credit. “See,”\r\nthey cried, “see what _we_ are doing!” But they failed to observe\r\nthat the decline prevailed among millions who did not participate\r\nin the cowpox salvation. Soon, however, cases of smallpox among\r\nthe vaccinated began to be reported. At first they were denied.\r\nThey were impossible. When the evidence became too strong for\r\ncontradiction, it was said, “There must have been some mistake\r\nabout the vaccination; for it is incredible that any one can be\r\nproperly vaccinated and have smallpox: the human frame, when once\r\nit has felt the influence of genuine cowpox, is never afterwards,\r\nat any period of its existence assailable by smallpox.” Either some\r\ncarelessness on the part of the vaccinator, or some defect in the\r\ncowpox served for a while to reassure the faithful; but ultimately\r\nthese reassurances utterly broke down. Persons vaccinated by Jenner\r\nhimself caught smallpox and died of smallpox. Then said Jenner, “I\r\nnever pretended that vaccination was more than equivalent to an\r\nattack of smallpox, and smallpox after smallpox is far from being\r\na rare phenomenon; indeed, there are hundreds of cases on record,\r\nand inquiry is continually bringing fresh ones to light.” True;\r\nvery true; but what then of the assurance and prediction under\r\nwhich £30,000 of the people’s money had been pocketed--“The human\r\nframe, when once it has felt the influence of genuine cowpox, is\r\nnever afterwards, at any period of its existence, assailable by\r\nsmallpox”? Nay, more; Jenner descended even lower. He not only\r\nlikened vaccination to smallpox, but to variolation, that is to\r\nthe former practice of inoculation with smallpox; and as, he\r\nsaid, variolation was well known to be no sure defence against\r\nsmallpox, why should people be offended when smallpox in like\r\nmanner occasionally followed vaccination? Why, indeed! but then the\r\npromise ran--“The human frame when once it has felt the influence\r\nof genuine cowpox, is never afterwards, at any period of its\r\nexistence, assailable by smallpox.” In a letter to his friend Moore\r\nin 1810, Jenner said, “Cases of smallpox after inoculation are\r\ninnumerable.” And again, “Thousands might be collected; for every\r\nparish in the kingdom can give its case.” And he asked another\r\ncorrespondent, Dunning, in 1805, “Is it possible that any one can\r\nbe so absurd as to argue on the impossibility of smallpox after\r\nvaccination!” And this from Jenner, who had deceived the nation\r\nin 1802 with the assurance that, “inoculated cowpox was attended\r\nwith the singularly beneficial effect of rendering through life\r\nthe person so inoculated perfectly secure from the infection of\r\nsmallpox”!\r\n\r\nSuch was Jenner; such his inconsistency; and such the admissions he\r\nwas driven to make under stress of failures many and manifest.\r\n\r\n\r\nSMALLPOX MADE MILDER.\r\n\r\nAs vaccination failed to afford the protection originally\r\nguaranteed, various explanations were devised to enable those\r\nwho had talked too loftily to eat humble pie without painful\r\nobservation. One of the commonest excuses was that if vaccination\r\ndid not prevent smallpox it made it milder: and inasmuch as no one\r\nknew, or could know, how severe any attack of smallpox would have\r\nbeen _without_ vaccination, it was an assertion as indisputable\r\nas the reverse--namely, that vaccination not only made smallpox\r\nseverer, but frequently induced the disease. There are many\r\nassertions with which there is no reckoning, for it would require\r\nomniscience to check them. Let us beware of such assertions. Let us\r\nneither make them, nor suffer ourselves to be imposed upon by them.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUNCTURES, ONE OR SEVERAL.\r\n\r\nAnother excuse was advanced in the report of the National Vaccine\r\nEstablishment in 1814. It was said the failures in vaccination\r\nappeared to result from the practice Of making only one puncture\r\nfor the insertion of virus. One puncture ineffective! Why, if\r\none puncture were ineffective, how were the early miracles of\r\nvaccination to be accounted for, all of which had been effected by\r\nmeans of single punctures?\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. RIGBY’S PROTEST.\r\n\r\nThere was in those days a surgeon of eminence in Norwich, Edward\r\nRigby, and he at once entered his protest against the novel\r\ndoctrine. Writing to the _Medical and Physical Journal_ of August,\r\n1814, he said, “No physiological reason is assigned for this, and\r\nI believe it would be difficult to prove that a single perfect\r\nvesicle, which goes through the usual stages and exhibits the\r\ncharacteristic appearances of this singular disease, can be less\r\nthe effect of a constitutional affection than any given number\r\nwould be.... It cannot surely be doubted that a single perfect\r\nvesicle affords as complete security against Variola as any\r\nindefinite number; and, if so, there would seem to be an obvious\r\nobjection to unnecessarily multiplying the vesicles, _which in all\r\ncases go through a high degree of inflammation, are often attended\r\nwith painful tumefaction and even suppuration in the axilla_, and,\r\nif exposed in the later stages to any act of violence, _are apt to\r\nassume a very disagreeable ulceration_, more especially as young\r\nchildren, now the principal subjects of vaccination, are most\r\nliable to suffer in this way.” Rigby had the better side of the\r\nargument. As he observed, no physiological reason was assigned for\r\nthe recommendation of plural punctures; nor was any such reason\r\never assigned. It is the rationale of vaccination that a virus is\r\ninjected into the system which begets a fever equivalent to an\r\nattack of smallpox; and as smallpox rarely recurs in a lifetime,\r\nit is hoped that Nature may graciously recognise the substitute\r\nfor the reality. Organic poisons such as vaccine operate like\r\nfire or ferment. Quantity is of no account. So that the fever be\r\nkindled, excess is waste. A scratch at a dissection is as deadly\r\nas a gash. One bite of a mad dog is as likely to beget hydrophobia\r\nas a dozen. The sting of a cobra may be almost invisible, but the\r\npuncture is enough for death. Sir James Paget says of vaccine virus\r\nthat “inserted once, in almost infinitely small quantity, yet by\r\nmultiplying itself, or otherwise affecting all the blood, it alters\r\nit once for all.”\r\n\r\nSuch is the rationale of vaccination, and if I were a vaccinator,\r\nI should hold the position assumed by Rigby, and maintain that\r\none puncture is as effective as a dozen, inasmuch as with one\r\nit is possible to excite that fever which is the essential of\r\nvaccination; adding, in Rigby’s words, that as one puncture is in\r\nall cases attended with a high degree of inflammation, and often\r\nwith painful tumefaction, and even suppuration in the arm-pits,\r\nwhich in case of violence are apt to pass into very disagreeable\r\nulceration, especially in young children, it is most undesirable to\r\nincrease the number of such dangerous wounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. (MARKS) MARSON.\r\n\r\nI do not know that the condemnation of single punctures at that\r\ntime, seventy years ago, had much effect. Two punctures became\r\ncommon, chiefly to guard against the possible failure of one. It\r\nis of late years that the resort to many punctures has become\r\nfashionable. Mr. Robert Lowe, now Lord Sherbrooke, in the House of\r\nCommons in 1861 spoke of “the beautiful discovery which had been\r\nmade, that the security of vaccination may be almost indefinitely\r\nincreased by multiplying the number of punctures”! The chief\r\nauthor of this remarkable discovery was Mr. Marson, for many years\r\nsurgeon of the Smallpox Hospital at Highgate. He estimated the\r\nefficacy of vaccination by marks, and made so much of marks that I\r\nusually think of him as Marks Marson. He said--“A good vaccination\r\nis when persons have been vaccinated in four or more places\r\nleaving good cicatrices. I define a good cicatrix in this way:\r\na good vaccine cicatrix may be described as distinct, foveated,\r\ndotted, or indented, in some instances radiated, and having a\r\nwell, or tolerably well, defined edge. An indifferent cicatrix is\r\nindistinct, smooth, without indentation, and with an irregular or\r\nill-defined edge. When I find that a person has been vaccinated in\r\nat least four places, leaving good marks of the kind which I have\r\ndescribed, that person invariably, _or almost invariably_, has\r\nsmallpox in a very mild form.”\r\n\r\nReading a statement like this, we revert to the rationale of\r\nvaccination, and ask what can marks have to do with its efficacy?\r\nRemember, Marson offered no explanation of his statement. He was\r\nsatisfied to say thus and thus have I observed, and you may take my\r\nword for it. But in science we take no man’s word. We must see, or,\r\nlike Trelawney’s Cornishmen, we must know the reason why. Marson\r\nappeared before the House of Commons’ Vaccination Committee in\r\n1871, and set forth his marks doctrine with all the qualifications\r\nand inconsistencies which characterise the victim of a fad in\r\ncontact with facts which his fad fails to include or account for.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. WHEELER’S RESEARCHES.\r\n\r\nFatal cases of smallpox are confluent cases, and in confluent\r\ncases vaccination marks rarely show up so as to answer to Marson’s\r\ndescription of marks distinct, foveated, dotted, or indented, with\r\na well, or tolerably well-defined edge. And in this matter our\r\nacute and industrious friend, Mr. Alexander Wheeler, has explored\r\nthe records of the Smallpox Hospitals, and proved that vaccination\r\nmarks many or vaccination marks few have no influence whatever\r\non the character or issue of smallpox. As Mr. Wheeler shows, the\r\nclassification of smallpox into discrete and confluent is the\r\nonly clue to the right estimation of the fatality of the disease.\r\nSmallpox in the discrete form, that is, when the pustules are\r\ndistinct and separate, is not dangerous when uncomplicated with\r\nother disease, the overwhelming majority of patients recovering,\r\nvaccinated or unvaccinated. The contest between life and death is\r\nwaged among the confluent cases, where the pustules are so close\r\nthat they run together; and it is on these confluent cases, and the\r\nconditions and antecedents of the sufferers, that attention should\r\nbe concentrated. There is a third form of smallpox, the malignant,\r\nchiefly confined to persons of irregular life, which is almost\r\ninvariably fatal, and, as vaccinators themselves allow, vaccination\r\nin malignant smallpox affords no odds to its victims.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. ROBINSON’S OPINION.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, as Mr. Enoch Robinson has pointed out, there _is_\r\nsomething to be said for what Marson called good vaccination\r\nmarks. The bit of reality that constitutes the basis of the marks\r\nillusion is this, that a well-formed vaccine cicatrix represents a\r\nstrong vitality with vigorous healing power; whilst an ill-formed\r\ncicatrix represents a contrary habit of body; and, _pari passu_,\r\nthose who heal well under vaccination stand likely to make the best\r\nrecoveries in the event of smallpox. Good marks are simply notes\r\nof good constitutions, and the rest follows. Aught beyond is mere\r\nmedical rubbish, on a par with faith in omens and divination in\r\ntea-cups.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRUELTY OF MARKING.\r\n\r\nVaccination, in whatever form, is bad, but this faith in marks\r\naggravates its cruelty. Mr. Claremont, vaccinator for St. Pancras,\r\noperates on infants by the thousand, and inflicts on each four\r\nmarks. At a recent inquest on an infant, the victim of his\r\nhandiwork, I heard him say, “The mothers nearly always protest.”\r\nOf course they do. What kind of mothers would they be if they did\r\nnot protest! Apart from the venom, the shock to an infant’s life\r\nfrom such wounds is very serious. Mr. Young was called the other\r\nday to see a dying infant vaccinated by this Claremont. Previous to\r\nvaccination it was perfectly healthy, but never afterwards. From\r\nthe time of the operation it fell under a blight. “In its coffin,”\r\nsaid Mr. Young, “it lay like a child’s doll--the poor babe had\r\nwasted away.”\r\n\r\nI was glad to see in the _Times_ about a year ago a letter from Dr.\r\nAllnatt of Cheltenham protesting against the cruelty of vaccination\r\nas practised upon the children of the poor. He recalled the days\r\nwhen he was a pupil of Dr. Walker, in 1825-26, and his instructions\r\nwere to dip the point of the lancet into the fresh lymph, and\r\ninsert it tenderly without drawing blood, under the cutis of the\r\nforearm, and protect the wound with a slight compress. “But the\r\ncase is altered now,” he says. “Some of the vaccinators use real\r\ninstruments of torture. Ivory points are driven into the flesh,\r\nand wounds ensue which become erysipelatous, and in the delicate\r\nconstitutions of weakly children fatal.”\r\n\r\nThe case is altered now, says Dr. Allnatt; but why is the case\r\naltered now? Why, because, under the old terms vaccination was more\r\nand more seen to be no defence against smallpox; and to preserve\r\nthe rite, and the gains from the rite, the marks doctrine was\r\ninvented, or, rather, revived, and hailed as a sort of revelation\r\nfrom heaven.\r\n\r\n\r\nREVACCINATION INTRODUCED.\r\n\r\nWhen vaccination was seen to be no preventive of smallpox, it was\r\nconjectured that it might require renewal, a suggestion which\r\ndistressed Jenner exceedingly. It was calculated, he said, “to do\r\nunspeakable mischief,” depriving his discovery “of more than half\r\nits virtues.” But as experience continued to belie the claim made\r\nfor vaccination as a permanent defence, it was natural that those\r\ninterested in its performance should endeavour to retrieve its\r\nwaning credit. Thus revaccination began to be practised. Between\r\n1830 and 1835 there were 13,861 revaccinations effected in the\r\narmy of Wurtemburg. Dr. Holland (subsequently Sir Henry) after\r\nrecording the accumulating proofs of the futility of vaccination\r\nin 1839, recommended revaccination as a probable resource, and the\r\nrecommendation gradually acquired authority. The _London Medical\r\nGazette_ in 1844 boldly proclaimed, “Revaccinate, revaccinate!”\r\nBut so late as 1851 the National Vaccine Establishment protested\r\nagainst the innovation, saying, “The restriction of the protective\r\npower of vaccination to any age, or to any term of years, is an\r\nhypothesis contradicted by experience and wholly unsupported by\r\nanalogy.” Whatever the experience, however, and whatever the\r\nanalogy, there was the indisputable fact, that vaccination in most\r\nunimpeachable form did not avert smallpox, and that if the public\r\nfaith and the public money were to be retained, some fresh artifice\r\nwas essential. It was hard to surrender the original claim of the\r\nequivalence of vaccination to smallpox; but it needs must when the\r\ndevil drives; and so it has come to be admitted that Jenner was\r\nmistaken, and the vaccine rite to be effectual must be renewed.\r\n\r\n\r\nVACCINISATION.\r\n\r\nDr. Colin expresses what is now the common medical opinion in\r\nsaying, “We must not stop at a single vaccination. We must\r\nestablish the firm conviction in the public mind, that vaccine\r\nprophylaxy is only real and complete when periodically renewed;”\r\nand Dr. Warlomont, chief of Belgian vaccinators, goes yet further\r\nin advising and practising what he calls _Vaccinisation_; which is,\r\nthat every subject of the rite be vaccinated again and again until\r\nvesicles cease to respond to the insertion of virus. Then, and then\r\nonly, can the victim be guaranteed from smallpox! Such are the\r\nshifts to which vaccinators have been reduced. If their insurance\r\nwere valid, the premium would exceed the principal, whilst there\r\nis no reason to believe the new security is a whit better than the\r\nold. In these frantic prescriptions we see the quackery in its\r\ndeath-throes.\r\n\r\n\r\nABSURDITY OF REVACCINATION.\r\n\r\nAs for revaccination keeping off smallpox, it is absurd, and ought\r\nto be known for absurd. The chief incidence of smallpox is among\r\nthe young, in whom it cannot be pretended that the influence of\r\nprimary vaccination is exhausted. The subjects of revaccination\r\nare passing, or have passed out of the smallpox age; and as the\r\nstatistics of the army and navy prove, our soldiers and sailors\r\nare no more exempt from smallpox than the unrevaccinated civil\r\npopulation of corresponding years. In this matter, the old words\r\nstand true, _Populus vult decipi; decipiatur_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REDUCTION OF SMALLPOX.\r\n\r\nFrom whatever side regarded, the original and successive claims\r\nmade for vaccination are seen to have broken down; but a practice\r\nendowed and enforced as a poll-tax for the benefit of the medical\r\nprofession is not lightly surrendered. Instead a variety of\r\ndefences, more or less ingenious, are thrown out.\r\n\r\nI.--One of these is the reduction of smallpox. It is said,\r\n“Smallpox was once a common disease, and is now a comparatively\r\nrare one--How are we to account for this improvement otherwise than\r\nby the introduction of vaccination?”\r\n\r\nThe answer is, that smallpox was declining before vaccination was\r\nintroduced, and that, too, in spite of the extensive culture of\r\nthe disease by variolation; and the decline continued during the\r\nfirst part of the present century whilst as yet nine-tenths of the\r\npeople were unvaccinated. Several diseases once common have abated\r\nor disappeared; and why should we attribute to an incommensurate\r\ncause a similar abatement in smallpox? Leprosy, once extensively\r\nprevalent in England, has disappeared. Why? It died out gradually;\r\nbut suppose some rite, analogous to vaccination, had been brought\r\ninto vogue contemporaneously with its decline, would not the rite\r\nhave had the credit, and would not its practitioners have called\r\nthe world to witness the success of their prescription?\r\n\r\n\r\nHAS VACCINATION SAVED LIFE?\r\n\r\nII.--In the same line of defence, we have the claim made for an\r\nextraordinary salvation of human life. Thus Sir Spencer Wells in\r\na recent speech observed, “Jenner is immortal as a benefactor of\r\nmankind. It may not be generally known, but it is true, that Jenner\r\nhas saved, is now saving, and will continue to save in all coming\r\nages, more lives in one generation than were destroyed in all the\r\nwars of Napoleon.”\r\n\r\nThe answer to such a statement is to call for proof of the lives\r\nsaved. There is no proof. At the close of last century, 20 per\r\ncent. of the mortality of Glasgow was due to smallpox. Smallpox\r\nabated, but did mortality abate? Not in the least. Dr. Robert Watt\r\nin 1813 recorded the fact with amazement over it. And what was\r\ntrue of Glasgow was true of other cities and other populations.\r\nThere may be a cessation of smallpox, but (unless the result of\r\nsanitary improvement) the work of death is merely transferred to\r\ncognate agencies. There is no saving of life. What was a mystery\r\nto Watt is less of a mystery since the development of sanitary\r\nscience. Zymotic disease in its various forms is a definite\r\nevolution from definite insanitary conditions. It is not affected\r\nby medical repression, nor by the spontaneous substitution of one\r\nvariety of fever for another. In the words of Dr. Farr, “To save\r\npeople from smallpox is not enough whilst exposed to other forms\r\nof disease. Thus in a garden where the flowers are neglected, to\r\nkeep off thistle-down merely leaves the ground open to the world of\r\nsurrounding weeds.” To lower the zymotic death-rate it is necessary\r\nto reduce the conditions in which zymotic disease is generated.\r\nCiting Dr. Farr once more, “To operate on mortality, protection\r\nagainst every one of the fatal zymotic diseases is required;\r\notherwise the suppression of one disease-element opens the way for\r\nothers.” Dr. Watt and Dr. Farr alike believed that vaccination\r\nstopped smallpox, and alike realised that the disappearance of\r\nsmallpox was accompanied with no saving of life. Sir Spencer Wells\r\nis of a contrary opinion, which he shares with a number of people\r\nwho prefer the free, play of the prejudiced imagination to the\r\nsobriety of exact information.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHO ARE THE UNVACCINATED?\r\n\r\nIII.--Then we are asked to believe that though vaccination may\r\nnot keep off smallpox, it makes it milder, and in proof we are\r\nentertained with low rates of mortality among the vaccinated and\r\nhigh rates among the unvaccinated.\r\n\r\nWe reply, to make a fair comparison between the vaccinated and the\r\nunvaccinated, it would be necessary to compare class with class,\r\nphysique with physique, age with age. In other words, the subjects\r\nof smallpox should be constitutionally equal, their difference\r\nbeing limited to vaccination present or vaccination absent. So much\r\nis obvious.\r\n\r\nBut when or where has such comparison been even attempted? Nor\r\nwould it be easily practicable: for the vaccinated comprise\r\nthe best portion of the community, physically; but who are the\r\nunvaccinated? They are the waifs and strays of civilisation, the\r\noffspring of the miserable and the vagrant, who, without fixed\r\ndomicile, escape the attention of the vaccination officer. These,\r\nwhatever their ailment, whether measles, pneumonia, diarrhœa, would\r\nexhibit a higher rate of mortality than the vaccinated; but would\r\nit therefore be safe to argue that vaccination was not only good\r\nagainst smallpox, but against measles, pneumonia, and diarrhœa?\r\nYet it is these, the lowest physically and most neglected of the\r\npopulation, who drift into smallpox hospitals, who are exhibited as\r\nfearful examples of the neglect of vaccination. It might be added,\r\nthey are unbaptised as well as unvaccinated, and probably the one\r\ndefect may be as prejudicial as the other.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNVACCINATED DEATH-RATES.\r\n\r\nOur contention does not end here. Such is the prejudice in favour\r\nof vaccination that a bad case of smallpox is assumed to be an\r\nunvaccinated case. Over and over again has it been proved that\r\nvaccinated patients dead of smallpox have been registered as\r\nunvaccinated, their death being taken as evidence of the absence of\r\nthe saving rite. Again in severe smallpox, when vaccination marks\r\nare invisible, the sufferer is frequently set down as unvaccinated.\r\nDr. Russell, of the Glasgow Hospital, relates that patients\r\nentered as unvaccinated, showed excellent marks when detained for\r\nconvalescence. Had they died, they would have gone to swell the\r\nranks of fearful examples.\r\n\r\nIt is thus that the high death-rates of the unvaccinated are\r\naccounted for, the framers of hospital reports appearing to vie\r\nwith each other in extravagance. We are continually adjured in\r\nthe newspapers to confess our folly and repent, because 40 or\r\n60 or 80 per cent. of the unvaccinated have perished in this or\r\nthat hospital _because unvaccinated_. To us such statistics have\r\nfraud written on their face, and the more they are sworn to,\r\nthe more unscrupulous do their vendors reveal themselves. When\r\nall were unvaccinated last century, the hospital death-rate of\r\nsmallpox ranged about 18 per cent. Now we are asked to believe\r\nthat death-rate has doubled, trebled, quadrupled, and for no other\r\nreason apparently than to make for the glory of vaccination.\r\n\r\n\r\nNURSES EXEMPT FROM SMALLPOX.\r\n\r\nIV.--It is further said that nurses in smallpox hospitals never\r\ncontract smallpox because they are revaccinated.\r\n\r\nTo establish this assertion, it would be necessary to prove\r\nthat prior to the introduction of vaccination, or rather of\r\nrevaccination, it was common for nurses to fall victims to the\r\ndisease. The attempt is not made, and wisely, for failure would be\r\nconspicuous. Jenner never recommended vaccination as a protective\r\nfor nurses. Their general immunity, along with that of physicians,\r\nis noted throughout our older medical literature; nor is the reason\r\nfar to seek. Smallpox is predominantly an affection of the young,\r\nand it is no more surprising that a nurse should be proof against\r\nit than that she should be proof against measles, whooping cough,\r\nor scarlet fever. Nurses occasionally incur these maladies, and\r\nthey occasionally incur smallpox.\r\n\r\nIf revaccination preserves nurses from smallpox, to which they\r\nare exposed in the intensest form, it should much more preserve\r\nsoldiers, sailors, policemen and postmen, whose exposure is\r\nincomparably less intense; yet these servants of the state (as\r\nalready observed) are as liable to smallpox as their unrevaccinated\r\nfellow citizens of correspondent ages.\r\n\r\nTo speak plainly, the selection of a vocation so arduous and\r\nrepulsive, marks off a smallpox nurse as unimpressionable, and\r\nlittle apt to catch anything. Smallpox, too, is like tobacco:\r\ncustom fortifies the constitution against its immediate effects. If\r\nthe atmosphere of a smallpox hospital is endured for a fortnight,\r\nit is likely to continue endurable. On the other hand, if a\r\nvolunteer sickens on probation, she is not reckoned among nurses.\r\nLastly, many nurses have entered hospitals as patients, and have\r\naccepted service in default of other occupation. On these grounds,\r\nthe nurse argument breaks down irretrievably. At first sight, it\r\nseems something, but on scrutiny it proves nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOCK-MARKED FACES.\r\n\r\nV.--Another favourite argument for vaccination is the disappearance\r\nof pock-marked faces. People say when they were young such faces\r\nwere common, whilst now they are rare; and demand, What can have\r\nwrought the change if not vaccination?\r\n\r\nA medical man at a public meeting tried to dispose of some\r\nstatistics adverse to vaccination by saying that statistics\r\ncould be made to prove anything; and presently went on to relate\r\nthat when his mother was a girl every third person she met was\r\npock-marked. She had told him so repeatedly, and there was no doubt\r\nabout her accuracy. Thus statistics in general were untrustworthy,\r\nbut his mother’s statistic was unquestionable.\r\n\r\nWe need not hesitate to allow that when smallpox was common and\r\ncultivated pock-marked faces were more numerous: but we must not\r\nforget that whether a patient is marked or not marked is very much\r\na matter of treatment. Many at this day pass through smallpox, and\r\nsevere smallpox, and escape unmarked, simply because those who\r\nhave care of them observe certain precautions. It was different\r\nin former times. The treatment of smallpox was atrocious. The\r\nsick-room was made pestiferous by the exclusion of air and the\r\nmaintenance of high temperature. The patient sweltered under\r\nbed-clothes. He was neither allowed to wash nor change his linen.\r\nHe was drenched with physic and stimulants. In hospitals, patients\r\nwere stuck two or three in a bed, and stewed together. If, under\r\nsuch circumstances, the sick were restored to life pock-marked,\r\nwhat wonder! Patients who were fortunate enough to be sufficiently\r\nlet alone, stood the best chance of recovery.\r\n\r\nBesides smallpox was not equally diffused. In some places it was\r\nendemic; in others it appeared at intervals; and in others it was\r\nhardly known. The smallpox death-rate of Glasgow was double that\r\nof London; and we may therefore infer that pock-marked faces were\r\ntwice as numerous in Glasgow as in London. Hence when recollections\r\nare appealed to, they should be localised. What might be true of\r\none population might be grossly untrue of another.\r\n\r\nIt has been observed that smallpox was falling off toward the\r\nclose of last century, and the decline accelerated in the present\r\ncentury, irrespective of vaccination. An excellent illustration\r\nof this reduction of smallpox is furnished by the reports of the\r\nNational Vaccine Establishment for 1822, 1825, and 1837, where the\r\ndisappearance of pock-marked faces from London is triumphantly\r\nrecorded and claimed as a result of vaccination. In 1831 Dr. Epps,\r\ndirector of the Royal Jennerian Society, made the like observation\r\nand the like claim, saying, “Seldom are persons now seen blind from\r\nsmallpox. Seldom is the pitted and disfigured face now beheld;”\r\nadding, “but seldom do mankind inquire for the cause. It is\r\nvaccination. It is vaccination which preserves the soft and rounded\r\ncheek of innocence, and the still more captivating form of female\r\nloveliness.” Inasmuch as not ten per cent. of the population were\r\nvaccinated in 1831, the claim made for vaccination was absurd,\r\nwhilst the disappearance of pock-marked faces was sufficiently\r\nexplicable by the reduced prevalence of smallpox.\r\n\r\nWhere then is the argument for vaccination from the disappearance\r\nof pock-marked faces? When anyone under seventy proceeds to recite\r\nthe legend, “There is no use in arguing against vaccination, for\r\nwhen I was young every third or fourth person was pock-marked,”\r\netc., etc., the effect is droll. It shows how prone we are to fancy\r\nwe have seen what we think we ought to have seen. Droller still it\r\nis when striplings of five-and-twenty and thirty profess the same\r\nexperience--“When I was a lad,” and so forth and so forth. There is\r\nmatter for reflection as well as for laughter in the hallucination.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, if pock-marked faces are not so common as they must\r\nhave been a century ago, they are by no means rare; and if the\r\nargument for vaccination were valid, the pock-marked would be\r\nunvaccinated. But are they? Those who will take pains to inquire\r\nwill find that almost invariably they have been vaccinated, and\r\nsome of them repeatedly, the vaccination having as it were induced\r\nthe smallpox.\r\n\r\n\r\nVACCINIA A REAL DISEASE.\r\n\r\nThus far we have chiefly dealt with vaccination as if its fault\r\nwere limited to failure to prevent smallpox; but vaccination\r\nis more than an ineffective incantation. It is the induction\r\nof an acute specific disease. The prime note of vaccination is\r\nerysipelas. “The cowpox inflammation,” said Jenner, “is always\r\nof the erysipelatous kind.” He held that cowpox unattended with\r\nerysipelas was “incapable of producing any specific effect on the\r\nhuman constitution.” If it is supposed that Jenner is antiquated,\r\nwe may refer to a distinguished contemporary. Mr. John Simon\r\nreplying to the question, “Whether properly performed vaccination\r\nis an absolutely inoffensive proceeding?” answers decisively, “Not\r\nat all; nor does it pretend to be so.” The rationale of vaccination\r\nis that it communicates a mild variety of smallpox, and that with\r\na little of the devil we buy off the entire devil. Dr. Ballard,\r\nMedical Officer to the Local Government Board, in his treatise,\r\n_Vaccination: its Value and Alleged Dangers_, says, “Vaccination\r\nis not a thing to be trifled with, or to be made light of; it is\r\nnot to be undertaken thoughtlessly, or without due consideration\r\nof the patient, his mode of life, and the circumstances of season\r\nand of place. Surgeon and patient should both carry in their minds\r\nthe regulating thought, that the one is engaged in communicating,\r\nthe other in receiving into his system, a _real_ disease--as truly\r\na disease as smallpox or measles; a disease which, mild and gentle\r\nas its progress may usually be, yet, nevertheless, now and then,\r\nlike every other exanthematous malady, asserts its character by an\r\nunusual exhibition of virulence.”\r\n\r\n\r\nVACCINAL FATALITIES.\r\n\r\nHere we have Vaccinia defined as disease with precautions for its\r\nsafe reception; yet withal it is allowed it may assert itself with\r\nvirulence. But where do we find any precautions exercised in the\r\nvaccination of the poor?--that is to say, of the vast majority.\r\nPrecautions are not only disregarded, they are unknown, they are\r\nimpracticable. Infants of all sorts and conditions are operated\r\non as recklessly as sheep are marked. Whether they live or die is\r\nmatter of official indifference, whilst each is warrant for an\r\nofficial fee. Sir Joseph Pease, speaking in the House of Commons,\r\nsaid, “The President of the Local Government Board cannot deny\r\nthat children die under the operation of the Vaccination Acts in\r\na wholesale way.” Vaccination conveys an acute specific disease\r\n(having a definite course to run like smallpox or other fever)\r\nwhich, whether by careless treatment, or superinduced, or latent\r\ndisease, is frequently attended with serious and fatal issues.\r\nHence it is that vaccination is dreaded and detested by the poor\r\non whom it is inflicted without parley or mitigation; in itself a\r\nbearer of illness, it is likewise a cruel aggravation of weakness\r\nand illness. When the poor complain that their children are injured\r\nor slain by vaccination, they are officially informed they are\r\nmistaken. Dr. Stevens, a well-known familiar of the vaccination\r\noffice, says he has seen more vaccination than any man, and has yet\r\nto witness the least injury from the practice. Variolators used\r\nto say the same of their practice until vaccinators arose and\r\nconvicted them of lying. Coroner Lankester held that vaccination\r\nwas not a cause of death “recognised by law,” and was therefore an\r\nimpossible cause. Such prevarication is mockery. True it is that,\r\nif a child dies of vaccination, it dies of erysipelas, or pyœmia,\r\nor diarrhœa, and it is easy enough to ignore the primary cause and\r\nassert the secondary; but I would ask, How else can death ensue\r\nfrom vaccination than by erysipelas, pyœmia, diarrhœa, or similar\r\nsequelæ? If vaccination kills a child, how otherwise could it kill?\r\nEven should death occur directly from surgical shock, it would be\r\nsaid, the child did not die of vaccination, but from lack of vigour\r\nto sustain a trivial operation. The Sangrado of the Stevens pattern\r\nis never without a shuffle.\r\n\r\n\r\nVACCINIA MODIFIED IN ITS RECIPIENTS.\r\n\r\nIt is usual at coroners’ inquests on vaccination fatalities\r\nto produce children vaccinated at the same time from the same\r\nvaccinifer, and to assert that inasmuch as they have made good\r\nrecoveries, it is impossible that the virus was at fault, and\r\nthat something else than vaccination must have been the cause of\r\ndeath. The argument often impresses a jury, but it is grossly\r\nfallacious. Suppose a mad dog bit six men, and that five escaped\r\ninjury beyond their wounds and fright, and that one died of rabies,\r\nwould the escape of the five prove that the death of the sixth was\r\nunconnected with the dog? Or suppose an equal potion of gin were\r\nadministered to six infants, one of whom died and five recovered,\r\nwould the recovery of the five prove that gin did not kill the\r\nsixth? Mr. Stoker writes to the newspapers that he vaccinated\r\ntwelve other persons with the virus he used for Miss Ellen Terry,\r\nand that as no untoward symptoms appeared in the twelve, therefore\r\nMiss Terry’s whitlow had no connection with her vaccination--and\r\nthis in spite of the untoward symptoms falling due at the very time\r\nthat vaccination accounted for them! Any reasons are good for those\r\ndisposed to be convinced, and who have settled it in their minds\r\nthat vaccination is invariably harmless.\r\n\r\nNo doubt there is virus used for vaccination that is virulent\r\nbeyond other virus, as there is virus that is comparatively\r\ninnocuous; but, as Dr. Mead observed more than a century ago, “It\r\nis more material into what kind of body smallpox is infused than\r\nout of what it is taken.” The same virus that one constitution\r\nmay throw off with little effort, may induce disease and death in\r\nanother. Dr. Joseph Jones, president of the Louisiana Board of\r\nHealth, relates that “In many cases occurring in the Confederate\r\nArmy, the deleterious effects of vaccination were clearly referable\r\nto the condition of the forces, and the constitution of the blood\r\nof the patients; for it was observed in a number of instances that\r\nthe same lymph from a healthy infant inoculated upon different\r\nindividuals produced different result’s corresponding to the state\r\nof the system; in those who were well fed and robust, producing\r\nno ill-effects, whilst in the soldiers who had been subjected to\r\nincessant fatigue, exposure, and poor diet, the gravest results\r\nfollowed.”\r\n\r\nSome constitutions are peculiarly liable to injury from vaccine\r\nvirus, just as some constitutions cannot endure drugs that others\r\nreceive without inconvenience. Thus it is that fatalities from\r\nvaccination are frequent in certain families. Of these, neither\r\nthe law nor medical men condescend to take account. Parents often\r\nplead in vain for exemption from the rite on the ground that they\r\nhave already had children injured or slain by its performance; the\r\nbrutal and unscientific argument running, “How can vaccination hurt\r\nyour children when it does not hurt other people’s children?”\r\n\r\n\r\nVACCINIA _PLUS_ OTHER DISEASE.\r\n\r\nNor is the case against vaccination yet complete. The virus used\r\nis not only Vaccinia, but more than Vaccinia; for it is impossible\r\nto propagate virus from child to child without taking up other\r\nqualities. This was clearly foreseen by the variolators when\r\nvaccination was introduced--_they_ making it a point to take\r\nsmallpox for inoculation from _known_ and _sound_ subjects. They\r\nmaintained that cowpox transferred indiscriminately from arm to\r\narm _must_ acquire and convey constitutional taints; and their\r\nprognostication was speedily and grievously fulfilled in the item\r\nof syphilis. Notwithstanding, the fact was furiously contested. It\r\nwas said that parents used vaccination as a screen for their own\r\nwickedness; and assertion alternated with denial even to our own\r\nday. At last the conflict is at an end. The evidence has grown too\r\nmultitudinous and deadly for evasion. The invaccination of syphilis\r\nis admitted, and any question is reserved for the degree of\r\nfrequency. Some are pleased to describe the risk as infinitesimal,\r\nbut their pleasure stands for nothing but itself. Deeds are\r\nexpressive beyond words. The wide resort to animal vaccination on\r\nthe Continent and in the United States has but one interpretation.\r\nDoctors and patients do not abandon what is easy for what is\r\ntroublesome, nor incur the risk of the communication of bovine\r\ndisorders unless under the influence of over-mastering terror.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATISTICAL EVIDENCE OF EXTRA DISEASE.\r\n\r\nRelations of individual experience may be disregarded as\r\nuntrustworthy, but the broad evidence of national statistics\r\nconveys authoritative lessons. Vaccination in England was made\r\ncompulsory in 1853, stringently so in 1867, and systematically\r\nextended to the entire population. If therefore it were true that\r\nvaccination often communicates more than Vaccinia, and that it\r\naggravates existent and excites latent disease, the proof must be\r\nmanifest in the statistics of the Registrar-General. Thus argued\r\nMr. C. H. Hopwood, and accordingly he moved in the House of Commons\r\nsuccessively for three Returns, published as follows--VACCINATION,\r\nMORTALITY, No. 433, 1877; MORTALITY (GENERAL AND INFANT), No. 76,\r\n1880; and DEATHS (ENGLAND AND WALES), No. 392, 1880.\r\n\r\nThese Returns, charged with curious and authentic information,\r\nare little known, and have been treated with significant silence\r\nby the press. Obscurantism is not confined to ecclesiastics. Our\r\nvaliant journalists who mock at the Index Expurgatorius, and abhor\r\nthe Russian censorship, are in their little way as ready to act the\r\nsame part in favour of established prejudice. If facts adverse to\r\nthe public confidence in vaccination are revealed, it is considered\r\nno more than decent to keep them out of sight.\r\n\r\nWhat then is the evidence of Mr. Hopwood’s Returns? Briefly this:\r\nthey clearly illustrate that vaccination does produce, intensify,\r\nexcite and inoculate disease whose issue is death. The record\r\nof infant mortality from fifteen specified diseases related to\r\nvaccination stands thus--\r\n\r\n    Prior to Vaccination Act--1847-53--\r\n        Infants died, 1847,                  62,619\r\n            Out of a population of 17,927,609.\r\n\r\n    Vaccination Obligatory--1854-67--\r\n        Infants died, 1854,                  73,000\r\n            Do.       1867,                  92,827\r\n            Out of a population of 20,066,224.\r\n\r\n    Vaccination Enforced--1868-75--\r\n        Infants died, 1868,                  96,282\r\n            Do.           1875,             106,173\r\n            Out of a population of 22,712,266.\r\n\r\nThus, while the population of England and Wales had increased from\r\n18 to 23 millions, the deaths of infants from fifteen diseases had\r\nrisen from 63,000 to 106,000. Had the mortality kept pace with the\r\npopulation, the deaths in 1875 would only have been 80,000; that\r\nis to say, in 1875 there perished in England 26,000 infants who\r\nwould have lived had vaccination remained as little in vogue as in\r\n1847! The result though startling in the gross is precisely what\r\nmight have been predicted. The infancy of a country cannot be\r\nsystematically diseased, that is vaccinated, without exciting and\r\naggravating other maladies, and thereby enlarging the harvest of\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n\r\nVACCINIA AGGRAVATES DISEASE.\r\n\r\nThe asserted connection of vaccination with other ailments, such\r\nas bronchitis, sometimes gives occasion to ignorant ridicule.\r\n“Bronchitis,” says Sir Lyon Playfair, “has about the same relation\r\nto vaccination as the Goodwin Sands have to Tenterden Steeple.” The\r\nanswer is that the debility produced by vaccination predisposes\r\nto affections of the respiratory organs. The human body does not\r\nconsist of isolated compartments, but is an organised whole,\r\nsympathetic in all its parts and functions. Erysipelas, as we\r\nhave seen, is the primary symptom of inoculated Vaccinia, and\r\ndiarrhœa is its commonest sequence; and given erysipelas and\r\ndiarrhœa, what vigour may remain to assist and throw off other\r\nailments? It is not said that certain maladies are communicated by\r\nvaccination, but that vaccination contributes to their fatality.\r\nAn infant that would have survived bronchitis dies of bronchitis\r\n_and_ vaccination; dies of teething _and_ vaccination; dies of\r\nconvulsions _and_ vaccination; dies of whooping-cough _and_\r\nvaccination; and so on. Again disease kindles disease, and many a\r\nchild might outgrow congenital scrofula or phthisis if the latent\r\ndisorder were not roused by vaccination. For these reasons no doubt\r\nneed be entertained that were vaccination abolished, the event\r\nwould be immediately signalised by an extraordinary fall in infant\r\nmortality.\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF COMPULSORY VACCINATION.\r\n\r\nIf vaccination were a voluntary superstition, its prevalence would\r\nbe sufficiently deplorable; but when we think of it as inflicted\r\non the nation, and pressed on those who know it for an injurious\r\nimposture, language is apt to arise which it is expedient to\r\nrepress. It may be asked how it came to pass that legislation\r\nwas ever compromised with a medical prescription, and the answer\r\nis not a reassuring one. The initial error was the endowment in\r\n1808 of the National Vaccine Establishment, and the provision of\r\nvaccination fees in 1840 out of the poor rate. For the enforcement\r\nof vaccination, there never was any popular demand--never the\r\nslightest. The public had, however, learnt from sanitarians that a\r\nlarge part of the sickness from which they suffered did not come\r\nof fate, but was preventible; and under this novel persuasion\r\nthe vast expenditure on sanitary works during the past fifty\r\nyears has been cheerfully incurred. Availing themselves of this\r\nfavourable disposition in the public mind toward projects in the\r\nname of health, certain medical place-hunters operating as the\r\nEpidemiological Society contrived to gain the ear of Government\r\nand to pass a compulsory Vaccination Act in 1853. The politicians\r\nwho lent themselves to this transaction disowned any knowledge\r\nof vaccination. They acted, they said, under medical advice, and\r\nran the bill through Parliament with little resistance. The Act\r\ndid not personally concern M.P.’s. If they happened to believe in\r\nvaccination, their children received the rite with all recognised\r\nprecautions. Its enforced application by contract at 1s. or 1s.\r\n6d. per head was reserved for the unenfranchised and unconsulted\r\nmultitude; whilst the administration of the Act provided place and\r\npay for its ingenious promoters.\r\n\r\n\r\nRESISTANCE, INFLEXIBLE RESISTANCE.\r\n\r\nWhen an oppressive law is enacted, by whatever strategy or however\r\ncorruptly, its repeal is no easy matter. The oppressors have won\r\nthe nine points of possession. The antagonists of the Vaccination\r\nActs nevertheless possess a certain advantage. Some bad laws can\r\nonly be denounced as it were from a distance; but vaccination\r\ntouches every household, and can be fought wherever a child is\r\nclaimed as a victim for the rite.\r\n\r\nWe abhor the rite. We detest it as an imposture. We dread it as\r\na danger. We refuse it on any terms. We encourage, we justify,\r\nwe insist on the duty of rejection. Our contention extends and\r\nprospers. In various parts of the country resistance has been\r\nrewarded with success. The evil law has been broken down. Freedom\r\nhas been recovered and freedom is enjoyed. In other parts the\r\nstruggle for liberty proceeds, and as it proceeds, light is\r\ndiffused and courage evoked for enlarged resistance. Elsewhere\r\nthere are vindictive and cruel prosecutions, chiefly of humble\r\nfolk. “Respected ratepayers,” to whom the law is objectionable and\r\nits penalties trivial annoyances, are discreetly passed over. Hard,\r\nhowever, is the lot of poor men, who for love of their children\r\naffront the dull animosity and ignorance of English Philistines\r\nwhether as guardians or as magistrates on the bench of injustice.\r\nShortly co-operation for defence and insurance against fines will\r\nenable the feeblest and most fearful to maintain his integrity\r\nand encounter his pursuers with undaunted front. Parliament, as\r\nour statesmen allow, is deaf to the aggrieved until they make\r\nthemselves intolerable, and to raise ourselves to that pitch must\r\nbe our end and aim.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPULSORY EDUCATION AND VACCINATION.\r\n\r\nMany good people are distressed over the operation of this\r\nextraordinary law, and sometimes in their perplexity adventure\r\nfor excuse, “Surely since we compel parents to educate their\r\nchildren, it cannot be wrong to compel them to have their children\r\nvaccinated.”\r\n\r\nWe answer, education is compulsory so far as it is outside\r\nconscience. Compulsion is designed to overcome parental\r\nindifference and selfishness: where it confronts serious\r\nconvictions it is arrested. By general consent the most important\r\npart of education is religion; and religion is precisely that part\r\nof education which is exempted from compulsion. The law does not\r\neven enforce _some_ form of religion, so that parents who regard\r\nreligion as superfluous may not be aggrieved.\r\n\r\nWhat therefore the opponents of vaccination demand is, that the\r\nrespect thus accorded to the religious conscience be extended\r\nto the scientific conscience--to those who are convinced that\r\nvaccination does not prevent smallpox or is an injurious practice.\r\nEven allowing it to be a harmless ceremony, resistance would be\r\njustifiable. It would be in vain to console a Baptist, forced to\r\nconvey his child to the parish font, with the assurance that a\r\nfew drops of water could do no harm. It is not in human nature\r\nto submit to the indignity of imposture; and to thousands of\r\nEnglishmen vaccination is a cruel and degrading imposture, and\r\nto punish them for their loyalty to what they think right is\r\nevery whit as tyrannical as it was for Catholics to persecute\r\nProtestants, and Protestants Catholics, and Catholics and\r\nProtestants Jews. There is no difference in the terms of\r\nintolerance; and there is no difference in the spirit with which\r\nthis latter-day tyranny is confronted, and that spirit with which\r\nreligious liberty was vindicated and won.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONDITIONS OF THE CONFLICT.\r\n\r\nTo some eyes the conflict is not only arduous; it is hopeless;\r\nbut we are of a different mind. The conflict may prove even less\r\narduous than it appears; and for these reasons. The law as it\r\nstands is perfunctorily defended. No politician answers for it\r\nwithout reluctance. Many allow that a serious mistake was made\r\nwhen legislation was enacted for medical advantage at medical\r\ndictation. The Gladstone government proposed to abolish repeated\r\npenalties. The central authorities at the Local Government Board\r\nmake no secret of the insuperable difficulties which attend the\r\nadministration of the law. They advise concession to its resolute\r\nadversaries. They do not reinstate the law where it has broken\r\ndown. Legislation thus discredited is sure to collapse under\r\nbroader pressure. The medical support is still weaker; and is\r\nchiefly confined to those who represent the trade element of the\r\nprofession--men who would defend any abuse however flagrant if\r\nestablished and lucrative. It is the custom to laud the immortal\r\nJenner and the salvation he wrought, but these are words of an old\r\nsong. Those who have penetrated to the inception of the Jennerian\r\nrite; who know the absolute promise by which it prevailed and its\r\nabsolute failure; who have followed its successive transformations\r\nand varieties with their respective injuries and fatalities; who\r\nare aware of the Babel of confusion and contradiction in which\r\nits venal practitioners are involved--these we say recognise how\r\nimpossible it is for vaccination to be brought under discussion\r\nand survive. It is this consciousness which accounts for the\r\nreserve of the more prudent order of medical men. They excuse their\r\nacquiescence in the delusion (after the manner of ecclesiastics) by\r\nthe exigencies of professional loyalty; and by the supposition that\r\nthe harm of the practice is exaggerated, whilst it serves for the\r\nconsolation of the vulgar. It is for such reasons that we consider\r\nthe conflict less arduous than it appears. The fortifications are\r\nundermined; the bulwarks are rotten through and through. Over all,\r\nwe place our confidence in the omnipotent favour of the truth.\r\nGoliath, mighty and vaunting, is evermore laid low by a smooth\r\nstone shapen in the waters of verity.\r\n\r\n\r\nA WORD FOR THE AUTHOR.\r\n\r\nThe Story of this Great Delusion, I have tried to tell concisely,\r\nkeeping close to matter-of-fact, and with some exceptions adhering\r\nto English experience. When we venture abroad, we are apt to fall\r\ninto inaccuracies and draw unwarrantable conclusions. I am told my\r\nanimus is too pronounced, and that I should have done better had I\r\nadopted a more judicial tone. Ah well! we should always have done\r\ndifferently had we done differently. It seems to me a man does best\r\nwhen he is most truly himself; and I question whether I should have\r\nimproved my case had I tried to conceal my real mind in order to\r\nmake a more startling show of it at the close.\r\n\r\n\r\nL’ENVOI.\r\n\r\nLastly, a word to those who are accustomed to dismiss opponents of\r\nvaccination as fools and fanatics. It is related of Sydney Smith\r\nthat calling on Lord Melbourne one morning, he found his lordship\r\nin an evil temper and cursing at large. Smith, urgent about his\r\nown affairs, at last observed that they should take everything\r\nfor damned and proceed to business. For like reason I would\r\nsuggest that the familiar tirade of fool and fanatic be taken as\r\nspoken, and that we proceed to discuss vaccination and compulsory\r\nvaccination on their merits.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDR.

The practice was\r\nfirst brought under English attention by Emanuel Timoni in a\r\nletter, dated Constantinople, December, 1713, communicated to the\r\nRoyal Society by Dr. Woodward, and published in the Society’s\r\n_Transactions_ for 1714.[1] About the same time, Pylarini, Venetian\r\nconsul at Smyrna, described the practice in a Latin pamphlet\r\nprinted at Venice, 1715,[2] and reproduced in the _Philosophical\r\nTransactions_ for 1716. Mr. Kennedy, an English surgeon, who had\r\nvisited Turkey, also reported the practice under the designation of\r\n“Engrafting the Smallpox.”[3]\r\n\r\nTimoni was a Greek physician, who had studied at Oxford and Padua,\r\nand then established himself in Constantinople. He described\r\n“smallpox by incision” as having been practised in Constantinople\r\nfor forty years, and that it had been found uniformly successful in\r\nwarding off smallpox as naturally developed. The variolous matter\r\nwas usually taken from healthy boys suffering from the spontaneous\r\ndisease, and was applied to persons of all ages and temperaments,\r\ncausing them no more than temporary and trifling inconvenience. The\r\nonly preparation requisite for incision was abstinence from flesh\r\nand broth for twenty or twenty-five days.\r\n\r\nIt so happened that when Woodward read Timoni’s letter to the\r\nRoyal Society, he at the same time produced a selection from the\r\ncorrespondence of Cotton Mather of Boston, Massachusetts--a curious\r\njumble of facts and fancies. Mather had been elected a Fellow\r\nof the Society, and the selections from his correspondence, and\r\nTimoni’s letter appeared in the same number of the _Transactions_,\r\nNo. 338, 1714.\r\n\r\nCotton Mather is one of the marvels of biography--a choice specimen\r\nof Puritanism developed without check. He was a man of boundless\r\nenergy and incessant industry, of intense piety and unlimited\r\nself-confidence; and thus, without hesitation, he set himself\r\nto extirpate witchcraft, shrinking from no atrocity, until the\r\nfrightful Salem tragedy of 1692 shocked the colony into mercy and\r\ncommon-sense.\r\n\r\nMather was just the sort of character to be impressed with Timoni’s\r\ndescription of the short and easy way with smallpox; and he who had\r\nhanged warlocks and witches with sublime assurance, was not likely\r\nto have scruples about inoculating the community when inwardly\r\nsatisfied it was for the public good. The audacity and tyranny of\r\nconscientious conceit are proverbial. He had, however, to exercise\r\npatience in awaiting an opportunity to test the Turkish remedy,\r\nfor there had been no smallpox in Boston for nineteen years--a\r\nfact worth noting by those who imagine smallpox was an omnipresent\r\nailment until the advent of Edward Jenner. In 1721 a serious\r\noutbreak occurred, the deaths rising in October to 100 a week in a\r\npopulation of 15,000. Mather convoked a meeting of physicians, and\r\nlaid before them the new prescription, but they would not listen\r\nto it. Dr. Boylston, however, was persuaded, and inoculated two of\r\nhis slaves, and then his sons, aged five and six; whereon he was\r\nsummoned before the justices and severely reprimanded. Undeterred\r\nby the State, and supported by the Church, he persevered, and\r\nby the end of September had inoculated 80, and by the middle of\r\nDecember, 250.\r\n\r\nHis custom was to make a couple of incisions in the arms, into\r\nwhich bits of lint dipped in pox-matter were inserted. At the end\r\nof twenty-four hours the lint was withdrawn, and the wounds dressed\r\nwith warm cabbage leaves. On the seventh day the patient sickened\r\nand pustules appeared, sometimes few, sometimes hundreds. Mather\r\nand Boylston maintained it was a most wholesome operation, for\r\nafter it “feeble, crazy, consumptive people, grew hearty, and got\r\nrid of their former maladies.”[4] To be poxed was to be rejuvenated.\r\n\r\nCotton Mather’s own account of the Boston experiment is worth\r\nreading. He wrote--\r\n\r\n    March 10th, 1721/2.\r\n\r\n  The distemper hath lately visited and ransacked the City of\r\n  Boston; and in little more than half a year, of more than 5000\r\n  persons that have undergone it, near 900 have died. But how many\r\n  lives might have been saved if our unhappy physicians had not\r\n  poisoned and bewitched our people with a blind rage that it has\r\n  appeared very like a Satanick Possession against the method of\r\n  relief and safety in the way of the smallpox inoculated!\r\n\r\n  I have prevailed with one physician (and for it I have had\r\n  bloody attempts made upon my life by some of our Energumens) to\r\n  introduce the practice; and the experiment has been made upon\r\n  almost 300 Objects in our neighbourhood, young and old (from\r\n  one year to seventy), weak and strong, male and female, white\r\n  and black, in midsummer, autumn, and winter, and it succeeds to\r\n  admiration!\r\n\r\n  I cannot learn that one has died of it; though the experiment\r\n  has been made under various and marvellous disadvantages. Five\r\n  or six have died upon it, or after it, but from other diseases\r\n  or accidents; chiefly from having taken infection in the common\r\n  way by inspiration before it could be given in this way by\r\n  transplantation.\r\n\r\n  Dr. Leigh, in his _Natural History of Lancashire_, counts it an\r\n  occurrence worth relating, that there were some catts known to\r\n  catch the smallpox, and pass regularly through the state of it,\r\n  and then to die. We have had among us the very same occurrence.\r\n\r\n  It was generally observed and complained that the pigeon-houses\r\n  of the City continued unfruitful, and the pigeons did not hatch\r\n  or lay as they used to do all the while that the smallpox was in\r\n  its epidemical progress: and it is very strongly affirmed that\r\n  our dunghill fowl felt much of the like effect upon them.\r\n\r\n  We have many among us who have been visited with the Plague in\r\n  other countries many years ago, who have never been arrested\r\n  with smallpox after it, though they have been exposed as much as\r\n  any other people to it; whence the belief now begins to prevail\r\n  among us, that they who have had the Plague will never have the\r\n  smallpox after it.\r\n\r\nConsidering the developed evidence that awaits us as to the\r\ncharacter and results of inoculation, it would be superfluous to\r\ndiscuss this singular report, but we may remark the consummate\r\naudacity with which Mather assumes and maintains his position. What\r\na masterly touch of the quack have we in these words--\r\n\r\n  I cannot learn that one has died of it. Five or six have\r\n  died upon it, or after it, but from other diseases or\r\n  accidents; chiefly from having taken infection in the common\r\n  way by inspiration before it could be given in the way of\r\n  transplantation.\r\n\r\nWe can readily understand how the hand that could give so adroit a\r\nturn to awkward disasters could in other days frame irresistible\r\nindictments for witchcraft.\r\n\r\nThe precise truth as to the extent of the Boston epidemic is far\r\nfrom easy to ascertain: it was the temptation of the inoculators to\r\nmagnify the numbers of the afflicted and of their antagonists to\r\nminimise. Thus we read--\r\n\r\n  At a meeting by publick authority in the Town House of Boston,\r\n  before His Majesty’s Justices of the Peace and the Select Men;\r\n  the practitioners of physic and surgery being called before them,\r\n  concerning Inoculation, agreed to the following conclusion:--\r\n\r\n  A Resolve upon a debate held by the physicians of Boston\r\n  concerning inoculating the Smallpox on the 21st day of July, 1721.\r\n\r\n  It appears by numerous instances, that it has proved the death\r\n  of many persons soon after the operation, and brought distempers\r\n  upon many others which have in the end proved deadly to ’em.\r\n\r\n  That the natural tendency of infusing such malignant filth in the\r\n  mass of blood is to corrupt and putrefy it, and if there be not a\r\n  sufficient discharge of that malignity by the place of incision,\r\n  or elsewhere, it lays a foundation for many dangerous diseases.\r\n\r\n  That the operation tends to spread and continue the infection in\r\n  a place longer than it might otherwise be.\r\n\r\n  That the continuing the operation among us is likely to prove of\r\n  most dangerous consequence.\r\n\r\n  The number of persons, men, women, and children, that have died\r\n  of smallpox at Boston from the middle of April last (being\r\n  brought here then by the Saltertuda’s Fleet) to the 23rd of this\r\n  instant July (being the hottest and worst season of the year to\r\n  have any distemper in) are, _viz._--2 men, strangers, 3 men,\r\n  3 young men, 2 women, 4 children, 1 negro man, and 1 Indian\r\n  woman, 17 in all; and of those that have had it, some are well\r\n  recovered, and others in a hopeful and fair way of recovery.\r\n\r\n    BY THE SELECT MEN OF THE TOWN OF BOSTON.\r\n\r\nDr. Fleuart of Boston wrote to London that of 70 inoculated, 14 or\r\n15 had died; and that at Roxbury, where there was no smallpox, 5\r\ninoculated had died.[5]\r\n\r\nConflicting as are the testimonies, we must allow much to the\r\nnatural aversion from an operation, not only novel, but disgusting;\r\nbut taking the best that could be claimed for the new practice by\r\nan enthusiastic advocate, the benefit was trifling when seriously\r\nscrutinised. Dr. Boylston visited London after the Boston epidemic,\r\nand finding inoculation in high vogue he published an _Account\r\nof the Smallpox inoculated in New England_.[6] George I. and the\r\nPrince and Princess of Wales had taken Inoculation under their\r\naugust patronage, and Boylston with loyal fervour burst forth--\r\n\r\n  Shall not physicians and surgeons recommend and bring it into\r\n  greater esteem and practice, and save (under God) thousands and\r\n  tens of thousands by it; and make further improvements in it;\r\n  and set more vigorously about it when they consider their great\r\n  Pattern and Example for it, namely, the greatest and wisest of\r\n  Kings, their royal highnesses the Prince and Princess at the head\r\n  of it; and that it has been used upon their Royal Issue with\r\n  great success?\r\n\r\nBoylston in his _Account_ recites his cases with, we think, general\r\nveracity. He performed 244 inoculations, and says, “there were\r\nin the towns near Boston about 36 persons more inoculated, which\r\nall did well; namely, by Dr. Roby about 11, and by Dr. Thomson\r\nabout 25, which, together with my 244, make up the number of 280;\r\nout of which number died only 6 persons, notwithstanding all the\r\ndifficulties the practice laboured under.”\r\n\r\nBeyond measure extraordinary was the bland assurance wherewith\r\nBoylston, in common with Mather and others, assumed and argued\r\nthat the 280 inoculated had been thereby delivered from the plague\r\nof smallpox and death. Accepting the improbable supposition that\r\nthe 280 were a fair average of 15,000 Bostonians, of whom one-third\r\ntook smallpox, we have to abstract two-thirds of the 280, or 186\r\nas superfluously inoculated, leaving 93 saved from smallpox. If we\r\nthen inquire how many of these were saved from death, and resort to\r\nBoylston’s statistics, who says,--\r\n\r\n  In 1721 and beginning of 1722 there were in Boston 5759 persons\r\n  who had smallpox in the natural way, out of which number died\r\n  844; so that the proportion that die of natural smallpox appears\r\n  to be one in six, or between that of six and seven--[7]\r\n\r\nWe find the number no more than 15, from which, if we deduct the\r\n6 who died under his hand, his trophies are reduced to 9, to save\r\nwhom he put 280 into serious sickness and jeopardy--so serious\r\nindeed in some instances (as appears from his own notes) that there\r\nwas slight reason to prefer inoculated to spontaneous smallpox.\r\n\r\nViewed thus in his own light--a light most favourable, how vain,\r\nnot to say impudent, was such boasting as this--\r\n\r\n  Now, if there be any one that can find a faithful account or\r\n  history of any other method or practice that has carried such a\r\n  number of all ages, sexes, constitutions, and colours, and in\r\n  the worst seasons of the year, through the smallpox; or indeed\r\n  through any other acute distemper with better success, then I\r\n  will alter my opinion of this; and until then, I shall value\r\n  and esteem this method of inoculating the smallpox as the most\r\n  beneficial and successful that ever was discovered to, and\r\n  practised by mankind in this world.[8]\r\n\r\nAnd, gaining courage through his own noise, he went yet farther,\r\nand proclaimed that smallpox was tamed and subdued--\r\n\r\n  It is, and shall be acknowledged, to the praise and glory of God,\r\n  that whereas a most wild, cruel, fierce and violent distemper,\r\n  and which has destroyed millions of lives, is now (by that happy\r\n  discovery made of its transplantation) become tractable, safe and\r\n  gentle.[9]\r\n\r\nIn the knowledge of the emptiness of this bounce, it may seem\r\nmalicious to withdraw it from forgetfulness; but it serves to point\r\nthe truth that human nature in 1726 was much the same as human\r\nnature at this day, and that the same arts of audacious assertion\r\nand rowdy rhetoric were in practice then as now. Indeed, whoever\r\nis sufficiently wicked to presume on the natural trustfulness of\r\nmankind, and will lie loud enough and long enough, may attain an\r\nappalling success--as our story, alas! will prove.\r\n\r\nOne thing goes to Boylston’s credit: he did not propose to make\r\npoxing universal--to poison and sicken everybody, and inflict\r\ncertain injury to avert future and uncertain danger from a few. He\r\nproposed to reserve inoculation for emergencies--\r\n\r\n  When the smallpox left Boston, inoculation ceased; and when\r\n  it shall please Providence to send and spread that distemper\r\n  among us again, may inoculation revive, be better received, and\r\n  continued a blessing in preserving many from misery, corruption\r\n  and death.\r\n\r\nThe narratives of Mather and Boylston are of special importance\r\nbecause we have in them the true lineage of inoculation as\r\nintroduced from the eastern to the western world. Boylston tells us\r\nthat when smallpox appeared in Boston--\r\n\r\n  Dr. Mather, in compassion to the lives of the people, transcribed\r\n  from the _Philosophical Transactions_ of the Royal Society the\r\n  accounts sent them by Dr. Timonius and Pylarinus of inoculating\r\n  the smallpox in the Levant, and sent them to the practitioners of\r\n  the town for their consideration thereon.[10]\r\n\r\nFor some inscrutable reason the true position of Cotton Mather in\r\nthe history of inoculation is continually overlooked or mis-stated.\r\nFor instance, in Mather’s biography in the excellent _English\r\nCyclopædia_, it is said that he derived his information and impulse\r\nfrom the letters of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu; a statement repeated\r\nin the memoirs of that lady, which is entirely fabulous.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] _Philosophical Transactions_, No. 338, 1714.\r\n\r\n[2] _Nova et Tuta Variolas Excitandi per Transplantationem\r\nMethodus._ Jacob Pylarinum.

Happening\r\nto refer to Walter Bagehot’s essay on Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, I\r\nfound this passage--\r\n\r\n  She brought from Turkey the notion of inoculation. Like most\r\n  improvers, she was roughly spoken to. Medical men were angry\r\n  because the practice was not in their books, and conservative\r\n  men were cross at the agony of a new idea. Religious people\r\n  considered it wicked to have a disease which Providence did not\r\n  think fit to send you; and simple people “did not like to make\r\n  themselves ill of their own accord.” She triumphed, however, over\r\n  all obstacles; inoculation, being really found to lengthen life\r\n  and save complexions, before long became general.[11]\r\n\r\nNow Bagehot loved accuracy and abhorred credulity; and yet in\r\nthese lines, delivered with as much confidence as a column of the\r\nmultiplication table, there are exhibited about as much inaccuracy\r\nand credulity as could be packed into the space. Let us see what\r\nLady Mary really did in the matter of inoculation.\r\n\r\nMr. Wortley Montagu was appointed ambassador to the Porte, and set\r\nout for Constantinople in the autumn of 1716 accompanied by his\r\nwife, then in her twenty-seventh year. The Ottoman Empire was in\r\nthose days powerful and proud, disdaining to send representatives\r\nto Christian Courts, and receiving ambassadors as commercial\r\nagents, or as bearers of homage from their respective sovereigns.\r\nThe English ambassador reached his destination early in 1717, and\r\nere a month had passed, and ere Lady Mary had time to look around\r\nand appreciate the strange world into which she had entered, with\r\nsprightly audacity she wrote as follows to her friend Miss Sarah\r\nChiswell--\r\n\r\n  I am going to tell you a thing that I am sure will make you wish\r\n  yourself here. The smallpox, so fatal, and so general amongst us,\r\n  is here entirely harmless by the invention of _ingrafting_, which\r\n  is the term they give it. There is a set of old women who make\r\n  it their business to perform the operation every autumn, in the\r\n  month of September, when the great heat is abated. People send to\r\n  one another to know if any of their family has a mind to have the\r\n  smallpox: they make parties for this purpose, and when they are\r\n  met (commonly fifteen or sixteen together) the old woman comes\r\n  with a nut-shell full of the matter of the best sort of smallpox,\r\n  and asks what veins you please to have opened. She immediately\r\n  rips open that you offer to her with a large needle (which gives\r\n  you no more pain than a common scratch), and puts into the vein\r\n  as much venom as can lie upon the head of her needle, and after\r\n  binds up the little wound with a hollow bit of shell; and in\r\n  this manner opens four or five veins. The Grecians have commonly\r\n  the superstition of opening one in the middle of the forehead,\r\n  in each arm, and on the breast, to mark the sign of the cross;\r\n  but this has a very ill effect, all these wounds leaving little\r\n  scars, and is not done by those that are not superstitious, who\r\n  choose to have them in the legs, or that part of the arm that is\r\n  concealed. The children or young patients play together all the\r\n  rest of the day, and are in perfect health to the eighth. Then\r\n  the fever begins to seize them, and they keep their beds two\r\n  days, very seldom three. They have very rarely above twenty or\r\n  thirty [pustules] in their faces, which never mark; and in eight\r\n  days’ time they are as well as before their illness. Where they\r\n  are wounded, there remain running sores during the distemper,\r\n  which I don’t doubt is a great relief to it. Every year thousands\r\n  undergo this operation; and the French ambassador says pleasantly\r\n  that they take the smallpox here by way of diversion, as they\r\n  take the waters in other countries. There is no example of any\r\n  one that has died in it; and you may believe I am very well\r\n  satisfied of the safety of the experiment, since I intend to try\r\n  it on my dear little son.\r\n\r\n  I am patriot enough to take pains to bring this useful invention\r\n  into fashion in England; and I should not fail to write to\r\n  some of our doctors very particularly about it, if I knew any\r\n  one of them that I thought had virtue enough to destroy such a\r\n  considerable branch of their revenue for the good of mankind. But\r\n  that distemper is too beneficial to them not to expose to all\r\n  their resentment the hardy wight that should undertake to put an\r\n  end to it. Perhaps, if I live to return, I may, however, have\r\n  courage to war with them. Upon this occasion admire the heroism\r\n  in the heart of your friend.\r\n\r\nIn this letter there was material for a smallpox idyl--nothing\r\neasier, nothing surer, “smallpox made entirely harmless.” But idyls\r\nare deceptive; their paradisiacal effects are obtained by the\r\nsedulous exclusion of whatever is otherwise. About the time that\r\nLady Mary was romancing so triumphantly to Miss Sarah Chiswell she\r\ndespatched this note to her husband--\r\n\r\n    Sunday, 23rd March, 1717-18.\r\n\r\n  The boy[12] was engrafted last Tuesday, and is at this time\r\n  singing and playing, and very impatient for his supper. I pray\r\n  God my next may give as good an account of him.... I cannot\r\n  engraft the girl; her nurse has not had the smallpox.\r\n\r\nWhy should the engrafting of the infant have been hindered because\r\nthe nurse had not had smallpox? The answer to the question reveals\r\na peril concealed from Miss Sarah Chiswell. Because the engrafted\r\nchild would probably have communicated unmitigated smallpox to the\r\nnurse. Why not then engraft nurse and child? Because they would\r\nhave sickened together, and mother Mary did not care to incur the\r\nrisk. There was no danger, she said; none whatever, only a pleasant\r\ndiversion; nevertheless she preferred discretion to her own voluble\r\nassurance.\r\n\r\nIn History we have always to suspect the picturesque, for mankind\r\nhave a fatal preference for handsome error over uncomely fact; and\r\nLady Mary Wortley Montagu as mother of English inoculation, and\r\nderivatively of vaccination, is ever so much more graceful than\r\ndull Timoni and Pylarini in the _Philosophical Transactions_, or\r\nCotton Mather in New England. Few condescend to inquire whether\r\nLady Mary, as primary inoculator, was acting independently, or\r\nwhether she had advisers and prompters. “All of her self and by\r\nher self” is the heroic representation--“a woman’s wit against the\r\nworld;” and judgment surrenders to fancy, as is the way with myths\r\nancient and modern.\r\n\r\nBut it so happens that what in itself ought to be incredible--that\r\na young Englishwoman should suddenly adopt the strange practice of\r\na strange people--is demonstrably incredible. Lady Mary did not\r\nact alone. She had for counsellor and director, Charles Maitland,\r\nthe physician to the embassy, who, familiar with the fame of\r\ninoculation, was glad to observe its practice experimentally.\r\nMaitland writes--\r\n\r\n  In the year 1717, when I had the honour to attend the English\r\n  Ambassador and his family at Constantinople, I had a fair\r\n  opportunity fully to inform myself _of what I had long before\r\n  heard_, namely, the famous practice of transplanting, or raising\r\n  the smallpox by inoculation.[13]\r\n\r\nHere we may note, too, that Maitland was aware that inoculation did\r\nnot originate in Turkey. He says--\r\n\r\n  Whilst universally practised all over Turkey for three-score\r\n  years past, it has been known in other parts of the East, a\r\n  hundred, or, for aught we know, some hundreds of years before.[14]\r\n\r\nIt was Maitland who managed the inoculation of young Montagu, and\r\nhe thus described the operation--\r\n\r\n  About this time, the Ambassador’s ingenious lady resolved to\r\n  submit her only son to it, a very hopeful boy of about six years\r\n  of age. She first of all ordered me to find out a fit subject\r\n  to take the matter from, and then sent for an old Greek woman\r\n  who had practised this way a great many years. After a good deal\r\n  of trouble and pains, I found a proper subject, and then the\r\n  good woman went to work; but so awkwardly by the shaking of her\r\n  hand, and put the child to so much torture with her blunt and\r\n  rusty needle, that I pitied his cries, who had ever been of such\r\n  spirit and courage that hardly anything of pain could make him\r\n  cry before; and, therefore, inoculated the other arm with my own\r\n  instrument, and with so little pain to him that he did not in\r\n  the least complain of it. The operation took in both arms, and\r\n  succeeded perfectly well.... He had about an hundred pox all upon\r\n  his body. This operation was performed at Pera in the month of\r\n  March, 1717.\r\n\r\nThat is to say, almost simultaneously with the Ambassador’s arrival\r\nin Turkey.\r\n\r\nThe embassy returned to England in 1718, after a residence\r\nof little over a year in Constantinople. The dates are worth\r\nobservation; for whilst it appears that the doctor and the lady\r\nwere in common resolved to recommend the practice of inoculation to\r\ntheir countrymen, the dates prove with what inexperience and levity\r\nthey assumed the grave responsibility. If quackery be assertion\r\nin absence of knowledge or of evidence, then we may accurately\r\nstigmatise Maitland and Montagu a couple of quacks. But so far as\r\nconcerns Maitland we may go farther, for he expressly tells us--\r\n\r\n  I was assured and saw with my eyes that the smallpox is rather\r\n  more malignant and epidemic in the Turkish dominions than with\r\n  us; insomuch that, as some have affirmed, one-half, or at least\r\n  one-third part of the diseased, at certain times, do die of it;\r\n  and they that escape are terribly disfigured by it.[15]\r\n\r\nYet this same Maitland, who thus testified of the impotence of\r\ninoculation to mitigate and restrain smallpox in Turkey, came\r\nto England ready to assert its power to mitigate and restrain!\r\nIt is difficult to find words of due severity for such impudent\r\ninconsistency. We shall see, however, in the course of this\r\nwonderful story, how every rule of evidence may be defied in the\r\nmatter of smallpox, and how it is possible to shut one’s eyes and\r\nprophesy in the name of science, and have noise and hardihood\r\naccepted for veracity.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[11] _Literary Studies_, Vol. i. p. 248.\r\n\r\n[12] Born in Yorkshire, 1713.\r\n\r\n[13] _Account of Inoculating for Smallpox._ London, 1722.\r\n\r\n[14] _A Short Account of Inoculation._ London, 1723.\r\n\r\n[15] _Account of Inoculating for Smallpox_, p. 4.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nMAITLAND’S EXPERIMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Mary Wortley Montagu returned to England in 1718, but not\r\nuntil 1721 did she fulfil her intention of making war on the\r\ndoctors, and incurring their resentment for the good of mankind.\r\nIn the spring of 1721 she commenced action in earnest by the\r\ninoculation of her daughter--the infant that it was considered\r\nunsafe to “engraft” when at Pera in 1718. In Maitland’s words--\r\n\r\n  The noble Lady sent for me last April, and when I came, she\r\n  told me she was now resolved to have her daughter inoculated,\r\n  and desired me forthwith to find out matter for the purpose. I\r\n  pleaded for a delay of a week or two, the weather being then cold\r\n  and wet. I also prayed, that any two physicians whom she thought\r\n  fit, might be called, not only to consult the health and safety\r\n  of the child, but likewise to be eye witnesses of the practice,\r\n  and contribute to the credit and reputation of it. This was at\r\n  first denied me, it might be out of a design to keep it secret,\r\n  or lest it should come to nothing.\r\n\r\n  In the meantime having found proper matter, I engrafted the child\r\n  in both arms, after the usual manner. She continued easy and well\r\n  till the tenth night, when she was observed to be a little hot\r\n  and feverish. An ancient apothecary in the neighbourhood being\r\n  then called, prudently advised not to give the child medicine,\r\n  assuring the parents there was no danger, and that the heat would\r\n  quickly abate, which accordingly it did, and the smallpox began\r\n  next morning to appear. Three learned physicians of the college\r\n  were admitted, one after another, to visit the young lady; they\r\n  are all gentlemen of honour, and will on all occasions declare,\r\n  as they have done hitherto, that they saw Miss Wortley playing\r\n  about the room, cheerful and well, with the smallpox raised\r\n  upon her; and that in a few days after she perfectly recovered\r\n  of them. Several ladies, and other persons of distinction, also\r\n  visited this young patient, and can attest the truth of this fact.\r\n\r\n  One of the learned physicians who had visited Miss Wortley,\r\n  having some years since fully informed himself of this method\r\n  of practice, and being thoroughly satisfied of the safety and\r\n  reasonableness of it, at length resolved to try it in his own\r\n  family; he had formerly lost some children in a very malignant\r\n  kind of the smallpox, and therefore advised me to lose no time to\r\n  engraft the only son he had left. The boy (who was not quite six\r\n  years of age) being of a pretty warm and sanguine complexion, the\r\n  Doctor ordered about five ounces of blood to be taken from him;\r\n  and then, in ten days after, having found matter which he liked,\r\n  I inoculated him in both arms. This was performed the 11th of\r\n  May, 1721.\r\n\r\nThe learned physician here referred to was Dr. Keith, and the\r\nfacility wherewith he adopted the novel practice supplies an\r\ninstructive commentary on Lady Mary’s anticipation of the\r\nresentment of “the profession”--her first imitator coming from\r\nthe ranks of the dreaded self-seeking obstructives. Furthermore,\r\nwe have to observe how different is Maitland’s account from the\r\nheroic myth current of “the one woman confronting the prejudice and\r\nill-will of the world.” Even Lady Louisa Stuart, who made it her\r\nbusiness to correct many misconceptions as to her grandmother’s\r\ncareer, writes--\r\n\r\n  Only the higher motive of hoping to save numberless lives could\r\n  have given Lady Mary courage to resolve upon bringing home the\r\n  discovery. For what an arduous, what a fearful, and, we may add,\r\n  what a thankless enterprise it was, nobody is now in the least\r\n  aware. Those who have heard her applauded for it ever since\r\n  they were born, and have also seen how joyfully vaccination was\r\n  welcomed in their own days, may naturally conclude that when once\r\n  the experiment had been made, and had been proved successful,\r\n  she could have nothing to do but to sit down triumphant, and\r\n  receive the thanks and blessings of her countrymen. But it was\r\n  far otherwise.... Lady Mary protested that in four or five years\r\n  immediately succeeding her arrival at home, she seldom passed a\r\n  day without repenting of her patriotic undertaking; and she vowed\r\n  that she never would have attempted it, if she had foreseen the\r\n  vexation, the persecution, and even the obloquy it brought upon\r\n  her. The clamours raised against the practice, and of course\r\n  against her, were beyond belief. _The facility rose in arms to a\r\n  man_, foretelling failure and the most disastrous consequences;\r\n  the clergy descanted from their pulpits on the impiety of thus\r\n  seeking to take events out of the hand of Providence; the common\r\n  people were taught to look at her as an unnatural mother,\r\n  who had risked the lives of her own children.... We now read\r\n  in grave medical biography that the discovery was instantly\r\n  hailed, and the method adopted, by the principal members of the\r\n  profession.... But what said Lady Mary of the actual fact and\r\n  actual time? Why, that _the four great physicians deputed by\r\n  Government to watch the progress of her daughter’s inoculation_,\r\n  betrayed not only such incredulity as to its success, but such\r\n  an unwillingness to have it succeed, such an evident spirit of\r\n  rancour and malignity, that she never cared to leave the child\r\n  alone with them one second, lest it should in some secret way\r\n  suffer from their interference.[16]\r\n\r\nThus is History written! An apothecary and three doctors, selected\r\nby the Wortleys at discretion, and admitted singly to view a\r\nprivate experiment, are converted into “four great physicians\r\ndeputed by Government,” rancorous and dangerous! Thus are myths\r\ngenerated!\r\n\r\nLady Mary was a woman of mark in society, fashionable and literary,\r\nand her exploit was naturally the talk of the town. Among her\r\nfriends was Caroline, Princess of Wales, a lady of more than\r\nordinary strength of mind and intelligence, with a taste for\r\ntheology and philosophy, the patron of Butler, and his sympathetic\r\nstudent. It has been said, “There never was a clever woman that\r\nwas not a quack;” and Princess Caroline was an illustration of\r\nits truth. The new remedy for smallpox caught her fancy, and she\r\ndetermined to put it to the test. She begged of George I. that\r\nsix felons should be pardoned on condition of their submission\r\nto inoculation, and the King was pleased to comply with the\r\nextraordinary request. Maitland was then called upon to exhibit his\r\nskill, but he hesitated to act as hangman’s substitute; whereon\r\nSir Hans Sloane, the court physician, was appealed to. Sir Hans\r\nheld counsel with Dr. Terry of Enfield, who had practised physic in\r\nConstantinople, and knew something of inoculation; and fortified\r\nwith Terry’s assurance, he was enabled to overcome Maitland’s\r\nscruples, real or affected. Accordingly, on the 9th of August,\r\n1721, writes Maitland--\r\n\r\n  I performed the operation of inoculating the smallpox on six\r\n  condemned criminals at Newgate in presence of several eminent\r\n  physicians, surgeons, and others. The names of the criminals\r\n  were--\r\n\r\n    1. MARY NORTH,              Aged 36 years\r\n    2. ANNE TOMPION,              ”  25   ”\r\n    3. ELIZABETH HARRISON,        ”  19   ”\r\n    4. JOHN CAWTHERY,             ”  25   ”\r\n    5. JOHN ALCOCK,               ”  20   ”\r\n    6. RICHARD EVANS,             ”  19   ”\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday morning, 9th August, he made incisions in both arms\r\nand the right legs of the six. Thursday passed and Friday passed\r\nwithout any indications of constitutional disturbance, and,\r\ndespairing of success, he obtained fresh pox on Saturday from\r\nChrist’s Hospital, and repeated the inoculation in new incisions\r\nin the arms of five of them. He had no matter left for Evans,\r\nwho, it appeared, had had smallpox in September, 1720, and who\r\ntherefore escaped hanging unwarrantably. The disease now “took,”\r\nand progressed satisfactorily. Says Maitland--\r\n\r\n  One day Mr. Cook, an eminent Turkey merchant, having seen the\r\n  persons engrafted in Newgate, and having fully considered their\r\n  incisions and eruptions, he openly declared they were the very\r\n  same as he had observed in Turkey, having seen a great many\r\n  instances; and that we might be assured they would never again be\r\n  infected with smallpox.\r\n\r\nDr. Mead suggested another experiment--that cotton dipped in pox\r\nshould be inserted in the nostrils; and a young woman sentenced\r\nto death received her life on condition of submitting to the\r\noperation. Here we have Mead’s own account of the transaction--\r\n\r\n  A learned author has given an account of the practice of sowing\r\n  smallpox, as they call it, known to the Chinese above three\r\n  hundred years, which is this. They take the skins of some of the\r\n  dried pustules, which are fallen from the body, and put them into\r\n  a porcelain bottle, stopping the mouth of it very close with wax.\r\n  When they have a mind to infect any one, they make up three or\r\n  four of these skins, putting between them with one grain of musk\r\n  into a tent with cotton, which they put up the nostrils.\r\n\r\n  I myself have had an opportunity of making an experiment to\r\n  this purpose. For, when in the year 1721, by order of his\r\n  Sacred Majesty, both for the sake of his own family, and of\r\n  his subjects, a trial was to be made upon seven condemned\r\n  malefactors, whether or not the smallpox could safely be\r\n  communicated by inoculation; I easily obtained leave to make the\r\n  Chinese experiment in one of them. There was among those who were\r\n  chosen out to undergo the operation, a young girl of eighteen\r\n  years of age. I put into her nostrils a tent, wetted with matter\r\n  taken out of ripe pustules. The event answered: for she, in like\r\n  manner with the others, who were infected by incisions made in\r\n  the skin, fell sick, and recovered; but suffered much more than\r\n  they did, being, immediately after the poison was received into\r\n  the nose, miserably tormented with sharp pains in her head, and a\r\n  fever, which never left her till the eruption of the pustules.[17]\r\n\r\nFinally, says Maitland--\r\n\r\n  On the 6th of September they were all dismissed to their several\r\n  counties and habitations. The thing has been successful on all\r\n  the five, far beyond my expectation, considering their age, habit\r\n  of body, and circumstances; and it has perfectly answered Dr.\r\n  Timoni’s account of the practice, and also the experience of all\r\n  who have seen it in Turkey.[18]\r\n\r\nSo Maitland asserted, but others were of a different opinion.\r\nDr. Wagstaffe, who visited the patients in Newgate regularly,\r\nmaintained in a letter addressed to Dr. Freind--\r\n\r\n  Upon the whole, Sir, in the cases mentioned, there was nothing\r\n  like the smallpox, either in symptoms, appearances, advance of\r\n  the pustules, or the course of the distemper. And it would puzzle\r\n  any one to conceive how it is possible that smallpox can ever be\r\n  prevented by inoculation. With the exception of one of the men,\r\n  the girl who had cotton dipped in matter thrust up her nostrils,\r\n  had as fair a smallpox as any in the place.[19]\r\n\r\nSir Hans Sloane and Dr. Steigertahl, physician to the King, to\r\ntest the matter farther, “joined purses,” and had one of the women\r\ninoculated in Newgate sent to Hertford, where smallpox of a severe\r\nform was prevalent, to lie in bed with smallpox patients. This she\r\ndid with impunity; but it was reasonably objected that many who\r\nwere not inoculated did so likewise and escaped without harm.\r\n\r\nThe Newgate experiment, of course, caused great excitement, and\r\ninduced many repetitions in town and country. The Princess of Wales\r\nwas especially alive to the importance of “the great discovery;”\r\nand for her additional satisfaction, six charity children,\r\nbelonging to the parish of St. James, were inoculated; and all but\r\none “took” and did well; the exception being due to the craft of\r\nthe child, who, for the sake of the reward, concealed the fact of\r\nhaving had smallpox.\r\n\r\n  Upon these trials, and several others in private families\r\n  [wrote Sir Hans Sloane], the Princess of Wales sent for me to\r\n  ask my opinion of the inoculation of the Princesses. I told Her\r\n  Royal Highness, that by what appeared in the several essays, it\r\n  seemed to be a method to secure people from the great dangers\r\n  attending smallpox in the natural way. That preparations by diet\r\n  and necessary precautions being taken, made the practice very\r\n  desirable; but that not being certain of the consequences which\r\n  might happen, I would not persuade nor advise the making trials\r\n  upon patients of such importance to the public. The Princess then\r\n  asked me if I would dissuade her from it: to which I made answer\r\n  that I would not, in a matter so likely to be of such advantage.\r\n  Her reply was, that she was then resolved to have it done, and\r\n  ordered me to go to the King, who commanded me to wait upon him\r\n  on the occasion. I told his Majesty my opinion, that it was\r\n  impossible to be certain, but that raising such a commotion in\r\n  the blood there might happen dangerous accidents not foreseen:\r\n  but he replied that such might and had happened to persons who\r\n  had lost their lives by bleeding in a pleurisy, and taking physic\r\n  in any distemper, let never so much care be taken. I told his\r\n  Majesty that I thought this to be the same case, and the matter\r\n  was concluded upon, and succeeded as usual, without any danger\r\n  during the operation, or the least ill symptom or disorder\r\n  since.[20]\r\n\r\nThe Princess Amelia, aged eleven, and Caroline, aged nine, were\r\ntherefore inoculated on the 19th of April, 1722.\r\n\r\nLet us return to Maitland, whose triumph for the moment appeared\r\ncomplete, and with it his assurance. To his detractors he professed\r\nboldly--\r\n\r\n  I could bring a great many cases of persons inoculated in Turkey\r\n  to prove _the constant and certain success of the practice_; in\r\n  all which I have never seen any miscarriage, except in one, which\r\n  was wholly due to the rashness and inadvertence of a surgeon at\r\n  Constantinople.\r\n\r\n  Is it not a matter of the greatest importance for us to know\r\n  how to prevent the mighty contagion of the smallpox, and how to\r\n  preserve our children from the violent attacks and fatal effects\r\n  of it?\r\n\r\nTo divine Maitland’s character--to determine how far he was\r\ndeceiver or deceived is not easy. He obviously made professions in\r\nvast excess of his knowledge. One of his contemporaries writes--\r\n\r\n  I remember Mr. Maitland at Child’s Coffee House, when the\r\n  experiment was just begun at Newgate, was as confident and\r\n  positive of the success and security proposed by inoculation as\r\n  if he had had twenty years experience without any miscarriage,\r\n  which made those who heard him justly suspect he was more\r\n  concerned for the employ than for the success of it.[21]\r\n\r\nHe had not the proper craft of this conscious rogue, for alongside\r\nhis assertions of absolute competence and safety, he set forth such\r\nconfessions of ignorance and disaster, that one is impelled to\r\npronounce him a purblind enthusiast. For example, take this case,\r\nwhich he published without apparently any sense of its scope--\r\n\r\n  _2nd October, 1721._--After due preparation of the body, I\r\n  engrafted Mary Batt, an infant of two years and a half old,\r\n  daughter of Thomas Batt, a Quaker, living at Temple, within three\r\n  miles of Hertford. The red spots and flushings appeared on her\r\n  face and neck the fourth day; and she kept playing about well\r\n  till the seventh or eighth, when she became a little heavy and\r\n  thirsty, with a fuller and quicker pulse; then the pustules came\r\n  out fresh and full, and the incisions discharged a thick and well\r\n  digested matter. She had not above twenty in all upon her; they\r\n  continued about three or four days, then dried away and fell off,\r\n  and the child recovered perfectly.\r\n\r\n  Thus far all was well; _but what happened afterwards was, I must\r\n  own, not a little surprising to me, not having seen or observed\r\n  anything like it before_. The case was in short this. Six of\r\n  Mr. Batt’s domestic servants, namely, four men and two maids,\r\n  who all in their turns were wont to hug and caress this child\r\n  whilst under the operation, and the pustules were out upon her,\r\n  never suspected them to be catching, _nor indeed did I_, were\r\n  all seized with the right natural smallpox, of several and very\r\n  different kinds; for some had the round distinct sort, some the\r\n  small continued, and others the confluent; all of ’em had a great\r\n  many, but especially the last, with the usual bad symptoms,\r\n  _and very narrowly escaped_. But they all (God be thanked) did\r\n  well (_except one maid_, that would not be governed under the\r\n  distemper, _who died of it_,) and now enjoy a perfect state of\r\n  health.[22]\r\n\r\nThus at the outset, smallpox and death were the products of\r\ninoculation--the peril to be averted was incurred and multiplied.\r\nYet the man who thus records his own infamous ignorance, had the\r\nimpudence in the same pages to assert--\r\n\r\n  _The practice prudently managed, is always safe and useful, and\r\n  the issue ever certain and salutary._[23]\r\n\r\nWords are wasted on such reckless folly: we perceive how true\r\nis Carlyle’s observation, “Stupidity intellectual always means\r\nstupidity moral, as you will, with surprise or not, discover if you\r\nlook.”\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Maitland, we may take another leaf from his\r\nexperience. He writes--\r\n\r\n  _12th October, 1721._--I inoculated Joseph and Benjamin, sons of\r\n  William Heath, of Hertford; the first of about seven, and the\r\n  second three years of age; both with the same matter and at the\r\n  same time: the last had a gentle and favourable kind; but the\r\n  first, namely, Joseph, being a fat, foul, gluttonous boy, who\r\n  would not be confined to the rules and directions I had strictly\r\n  charged his mother withal, as to diet and keeping warm, was taken\r\n  very ill before the eruption, and after it had a great load of\r\n  the continued small kind, but at last recovered and did well.\r\n\r\n  What a mighty difference is here to be observed between those two\r\n  boys! The reason of it seems to be plainly this: the younger, who\r\n  had the favourable kind, was of a clean habit, moderate appetite,\r\n  and easily governed during the whole process. The elder was not\r\n  only of a gross foul constitution, but likewise had a voracious\r\n  appetite, always eating and filling his belly with the coarsest\r\n  food--as cheese, fat country pudding, cold boiled beef, and the\r\n  like, which I saw myself as I came in by chance the third day\r\n  after the operation; nor was there any care taken to restrain or\r\n  keep him within doors in cold, windy, frosty weather; he once\r\n  wet his feet in water--insomuch that had he taken the smallpox\r\n  by infection, the world could not have saved his life. Hence it\r\n  appears how necessary it is to cleanse thoroughly foul habits\r\n  before the operation, and, withal, to keep patients to a very\r\n  strict regimen under it.[24]\r\n\r\nVerily, as Cobbett said, quackery is never without a shuffle. As we\r\nshall see, inoculation came to require a preparatory course of very\r\nstrict regimen--so strict as to be impracticable for the rank and\r\nfile of the world; but the practice was at first commended without\r\nany such conditions. What said Maitland’s patron, Lady Mary, in her\r\nfamous letter from Adrianople?--\r\n\r\n  The smallpox, so fatal and so general amongst us, is here\r\n  entirely harmless by the invention of _ingrafting_.... Every year\r\n  thousands undergo its operation; and the French ambassador says\r\n  pleasantly that they take the smallpox here by way of diversion,\r\n  as they take waters in other countries. There is no example of\r\n  anyone that has died in it.\r\n\r\nIt was under cover of such seductive assurances that inoculation\r\nwas introduced to England, and established in perversity and\r\nquackery.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[16] _Letters and Works of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu._ Vol. i. pp.\r\n88-90.

To do\r\nthat shrewd and brilliant woman justice, she made no pretence to\r\nthe character imputed to her, and in her copious correspondence,\r\nthere is not a hint of annoyance on the score of her patronage\r\nof the Turkish modification of smallpox. On the contrary, it\r\nwould appear that inoculation brought her a large share of that\r\nveiled notoriety in which she had sincere pleasure. Writing to the\r\nCountess of Mar in 1723, she says--\r\n\r\n  Lady Byng has inoculated both her children, and since that\r\n  experiment has not had any ill effect, the whole town are doing\r\n  the same thing; and I am so much pulled about, and solicited to\r\n  visit people, that I am forced to run into the country to hide\r\n  myself.[25]\r\n\r\nLady Mary understood her countrymen thoroughly, and, thirty years\r\nafter her exploits in inoculation, she wrote to Mr. Wortley Montagu\r\nas follows--\r\n\r\n    BRESCIA, 24th April, 1748.\r\n\r\n  I find Tar Water succeeded to Ward’s Drop. ’Tis possible, by\r\n  this time, that some other quackery has taken place of that.\r\n  The English are easier than any other nation infatuated by the\r\n  prospect of universal medicines, nor is there any country in the\r\n  world where the doctors raise such immense fortunes. I attribute\r\n  it to the fund of credulity which is in all mankind. We have\r\n  no longer faith in miracles and relics, and therefore with the\r\n  same fury run after recipes and physicians. The same money which\r\n  three hundred years ago was given for the health of the soul is\r\n  now given for the health of the body, and by the same sort of\r\n  people--women and half-witted men.[26]\r\n\r\nThose who fancy there could be any wide or effective resistance\r\nto inoculation in 1721 misapprehend the conditions of the time.\r\nThere was no scientific knowledge of the laws of health; diseases\r\nwere generally regarded as mysterious dispensations of Providence\r\nover which the sufferers had little control; and a great part\r\nof medicine was a combination of absurdity with nastiness. It\r\nwould not be difficult to compile a series of recipes from the\r\npharmacopœia of that day which would alternately excite amusement,\r\nsurprise, and disgust, and to describe medical practice from which\r\nit is marvellous that ever patient escaped alive; but so much must\r\npass without saying. Suffice it to assert, that to inoculation\r\nthere was little material for opposition, rational or irrational;\r\nand that what we might think the natural horror of transfusing the\r\nfilth of smallpox into the blood of health, was neutralised by the\r\ncurrency of a multitude of popular remedies which seemed to owe\r\ntheir fascination to their outrageous and loathsome characteristics.\r\n\r\nMoreover, as the dates prove, the interval was brief between the\r\nintroduction of inoculation and its authoritative acceptance. The\r\ngirl Montagu was privately inoculated in April, 1721, Dr. Keith’s\r\nboy on the 11th of May, the Newgate experiment took place on the\r\n9th of August, a variety of experiments followed, and lastly\r\nthe Princesses Amelia and Caroline were inoculated on the 19th\r\nof April, 1722--sharp work for one year. There was not time for\r\nopposition. The citadel of social approval was carried with a rush.\r\nAs a contemporary observed--\r\n\r\n  I could not but take notice with what united force and zeal the\r\n  practice was pushed on upon the life and reputation it received\r\n  from its admission to the Royal Palace; all pens and weekly\r\n  papers at work to recommend and publish it; and it was rightly\r\n  judged, then or never was the time; and had it not been for some\r\n  unlucky miscarriages, the Inoculators would have had the best\r\n  chance for full practice and full pockets that ever fell into the\r\n  hands of so small a set of men.[27]\r\n\r\nThe royal approval was assiduously worked, and there were not\r\nwanting hints that to question the goodness of inoculation was\r\nequivalent to disloyalty; and thus we find the Rev. E. Massey\r\nprotesting in a letter to Mr. Maitland--\r\n\r\n  I wish the Doctor more candour toward those who differ from him\r\n  than to insinuate that they are guilty of high treason, and a\r\n  better argument for this practice than the cry, Inoculation! and\r\n  King George for ever![28]\r\n\r\nBad reasons are often advanced against bad policy, and whilst it is\r\nprobable that some silly things were uttered against inoculation,\r\nyet I think every candid mind would be impressed with the\r\nmoderation of Maitland’s chief adversaries. There was Isaac Massey,\r\nfor instance, apothecary to Christ’s Hospital, who published\r\nseveral pamphlets in opposition, wherein candour and good sense are\r\nthroughout conspicuous. He defined--\r\n\r\n  Inoculation as an art of giving the smallpox to persons in\r\n  health, who might otherwise have lived many years, and perhaps\r\n  to a very old age without it, whereby some unhappily come to an\r\n  untimely death.[29]\r\n\r\nHe objected to the exaggerated dangers of smallpox wherewith the\r\nInoculators operated on the public fears, and appealed to his own\r\nexperience in Christ’s Hospital--\r\n\r\n  Where there are generally near 600 children, the nurseries at\r\n  Ware and Hertford constantly filling the places of those who go\r\n  off. It hath sometimes happened that great numbers have been down\r\n  of the smallpox, and ’tis but seldom that the House is free, or\r\n  not long so: yet I daresay, and Sir Hans Sloane, I presume, will\r\n  say so too, that in twenty years there have not died above five\r\n  or six at most of the distemper, and in the last eight years\r\n  there died but one.[30]\r\n\r\nSo lightly did he regard the peril of smallpox to the young that he\r\ndelivered this challenge--\r\n\r\n  Suppose that twenty-five Bluecoat Hospital boys at a medium, one\r\n  year with another, taken ill of the smallpox.\r\n\r\n  Suppose we likewise, that the Inoculators take out of the several\r\n  wards, yearly, as they find them, twenty-five boys, which are\r\n  inoculated.\r\n\r\n  Quere, What the difference of success? I solemnly protest that if\r\n  this could be put in practice, I would lay two to one against the\r\n  inoculated.\r\n\r\n  For, as I have said before, we have lost but one smallpox patient\r\n  these nine years [writing in 1723] although 1800 children have\r\n  been in the House during that time, and I declare to have met\r\n  with no unequal success in other families amongst children about\r\n  the same ages (that is between 8 and 15) where I have been\r\n  concerned, and I doubt not but many of the Learned Faculty, as\r\n  well as some others of my profession, can say as much from their\r\n  own experience and observation.[31]\r\n\r\nTo appreciate Massey’s contention on this point, we have to\r\nremember that smallpox is the designation of a disease of many\r\ndegrees of intensity; a consideration which Dr. Wagstaffe, another\r\nopponent of inoculation, thus enforced--\r\n\r\n  There is scarcely, I believe, so great a difference between any\r\n  two distempers in the world, as between the best and worse sort\r\n  of smallpox, in respect to the dangers which attend them.... So\r\n  true is that common observation, that there is one sort in which\r\n  a nurse cannot kill, and another which even a physician can never\r\n  cure.[32]\r\n\r\nOf course the Bills of Mortality were appealed to in evidence of\r\nthe extent and fatality of smallpox; and as it is matter of common\r\nbelief that prior to inoculation and Jenner (there is always a\r\nhaze about the date) people were mown down with smallpox, it may\r\nbe worth while reviving the table of relative mortality in London\r\nduring the first twenty-two years of the 18th century.\r\n\r\n          Burials from all Diseases.

The population of London in\r\n1701 was estimated at about 500,000 (there was no exact census),\r\nrising to about 600,000 in 1720. It was closely packed and lodged\r\nover cess-pools; the water supply was insufficient, and there was\r\nno effective drainage. The vast multitude was disposed, as if by\r\ndesign, for the generation and propagation of zymotic disease,\r\nand specially smallpox. Little attention was paid to personal\r\ncleanliness, and still less to ventilation, to light, to exercise.\r\nThe condition of a large urban community a century ago is almost\r\ninconceivable at the present day. Londoners were then only slowly\r\nand blindly rising out of those modes of existence which made the\r\nPlague of 1665, and other plagues, possible. Hence we need not be\r\nastonished that smallpox was a common and persistent affliction;\r\nbut it was less prevalent and less deadly than it is the custom\r\nto assert; and had the disease not been attended with injury to\r\nfeminine beauty, there might have been no more fuss made about it\r\nthan about any other form of eruptive fever.\r\n\r\nIt has also to be observed, that smallpox as a cause of death was\r\nprobably much exaggerated in the Bills of Mortality; for as Isaac\r\nMassey pointed out--\r\n\r\n  These Bills are founded on the ignorance or skill of old women,\r\n  who are the searchers in every parish, and their reports (very\r\n  often what they are bid to say) must necessarily be very\r\n  erroneous. Many distempers which prove mortal, are mistaken\r\n  for the smallpox, namely, scarlet and malignant fevers with\r\n  eruptions, swinepox, measles, St. Anthony’s fire, and such like\r\n  appearances, which if they destroy in three or four days (as\r\n  frequently happeneth) the distemper can only be guessed at, yet\r\n  is generally put down by the searchers as smallpox, especially if\r\n  they are told the deceased never had them.[34]\r\n\r\nMassey, in the same spirit of good sense, objected to\r\ngeneralisations about smallpox from the Bills of Mortality, as if\r\nall who died were slain by the disease and by nothing else.\r\n\r\n  There ought to be no comparison [he said] between sick people,\r\n  well regimented with diet and medicine, and those who have no\r\n  assistance, or scarcely the necessaries of life.\r\n\r\n  The miserable poor and parish children make up a great part, at\r\n  least one-half of the Bills of Mortality; to confirm this I have\r\n  examined several yearly bills, and I find that the out-parishes\r\n  generally bury more than the ninety-seven parishes within the\r\n  walls, and the parish of Stepney singly, very near as many as the\r\n  City of London yearly; this sufficiently shows what little help\r\n  and care are taken of the poor sick, which so much abound in all\r\n  those places.[35]\r\n\r\nOf course there lurks a fallacy in all statistics of disease\r\nwherein conditions of life are not discriminated. Whether patients\r\nsurvive or die from any zymotic ailment depends upon their breed,\r\ntheir circumstances, their habits, and their medical treatment\r\nand nursing--all essential particulars, yet difficult to define\r\nand register on a large scale. It would appear that in sound\r\nconstitutions, and with fair treatment, smallpox in 1721 was by no\r\nmeans deadly, whilst in bad constitutions, and with exposure and\r\nneglect, it was extensively fatal. Yet of these differences, little\r\naccount was taken by the Inoculators, and the malady was measured\r\nand discussed as though it were something uniform like water or\r\ngold. Massey in one year had 49 cases of smallpox and one death;\r\nin Stepney an equal number of cases might have shown a mortality\r\nof 20 or 30 per cent.; whilst Dr. Nettleton reported that of 1245\r\ncases in Halifax and adjacent towns in Yorkshire, there died 270,\r\nor about 22 per cent.[36]\r\n\r\nOne of Massey’s fears in relation to inoculation was the risk of\r\npoisoning the blood with more than smallpox. He was not disinclined\r\nto experiment with “duly prepared children infected with smallpox\r\nby inspiration,” for then--\r\n\r\n  They will run no hazard of being infected by a leprous, venereal,\r\n  or scrofulous taint that may, for aught we know, be transplanted\r\n  by inoculation.[37]\r\n\r\nMassey’s prescience has been woefully verified; is indeed under\r\nperpetual verification in the pollution and destruction of\r\nmultitudes of infants. The notion that virus with a complex of\r\nqualities can be transferred from one body to another, and operate\r\nwith the single quality the operator is pleased to favour, is a\r\nnotion that might pass muster in a manual of magic or folk-lore,\r\nbut which never can have any warrant in human physiology.\r\n\r\nOf course the chief strength of the opponents of inoculation (ere\r\nexperience gave them stronger ground) lay in the assertion of the\r\nfolly of incurring a certain injury for an uncertain advantage.\r\nWhatever the risk of smallpox to those who have it, yet large\r\nnumbers, it was argued, pass through life untouched; and why should\r\nthey make themselves sick, and risk their lives in order to obtain\r\na superfluous security![38]\r\n\r\nThe frequent assertion that the clergy thundered against\r\ninoculation is untrue and invented for effect. The Rev. Edmund\r\nMassey, Lecturer of St. Alban, Wood Street, did preach a sermon\r\nagainst the new practice, and a fair sermon it was, according to\r\nthe standard of sermons. Maitland published some remarks on the\r\nsermon, to which Massey rejoined; and if I select a passage from\r\nthe rejoinder it will prove, better than any description, that\r\nthe divine was more than a match for the surgeon. Said Massey to\r\nMaitland--\r\n\r\n  Inoculation, in your sense, is an engraftment of a corrupted body\r\n  into a sound one; an attempt to give a man a disease, who is in\r\n  perfect health, which disease may prove mortal.\r\n\r\n  This I said was tempting Providence.\r\n\r\n  To which you reply, It resembles that of a person who leaps\r\n  out of a window for fear of fire; and surely that can never be\r\n  reckoned a mistrust of Providence.\r\n\r\n  No, certainly, Sir, if his house be really on fire, and the\r\n  stairs burnt. ’Tis the only probable way of safety left; and if\r\n  the leap should kill him, the action could neither be called\r\n  sinful or imprudent. But what should we say to a man, who jumped\r\n  out of the window when his house was not a-fire, only to try\r\n  what he might perhaps be forced to do hereafter? This mad action\r\n  exactly hits the case between us. For if my house be not on fire,\r\n  that is, if I am in no apparent danger, what need I jump out at\r\n  the window? What occasion is there to inoculate me?\r\n\r\n  To carry on your own allegory, I would ask you, Sir, what human\r\n  or divine authority you have to set a man’s house on fire, that\r\n  is, put a man who is in perfect health in danger of his life by a\r\n  fit of illness? His own consent is not sufficient, because he has\r\n  no more lawful power over his own life or health than you have,\r\n  to put either of them in hazard.[39]\r\n\r\nIn short, nothing can be more unfounded than the assumption in\r\nliterature, popular and professional, that Maitland and Montagu\r\nwere confronted by a crowd of howling fanatics over whom they\r\ntriumphed as light over darkness. Marvellous is the imbecility\r\nwherewith biographers and historians reproduce the fables of any\r\ninventive predecessor.\r\n\r\nI shall now proceed to show that the practice of inoculation\r\nintroduced by Cotton Mather to New England, and by Maitland to\r\nEngland, collapsed in a few years under stress of the mischiefs and\r\nfatalities which attended it; that it was revived in a subsequent\r\ngeneration; that it proved a curse wherever practised; and that\r\nfinally it was abandoned with execration in the Western world.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[25] _Letters and Works of Lady M.

No sooner was the great\r\nEastern preventive advertised than it was said--Why, it is\r\nnothing more than a practice common in Wales and the Highlands\r\nof Scotland! Perrot Williams, M.D., and Richard Wright, surgeon,\r\nof Haverfordwest, communicated to the Royal Society[40] that the\r\npeople in Pembrokeshire had practised inoculation “time out of\r\nmind.” They either scraped the skin thin or pricked it with pins,\r\nand then rubbed in pus from a smallpox patient. This they called\r\n“buying the smallpox,” as it was customary to pay something for\r\nwhat was fancied to be “good matter.” The Welshmen gave the same\r\naccount of the practice as the Turks--there was no danger, no\r\nmishaps, and certain security from smallpox. In Scotland it did not\r\nappear that the skin was scraped, but worsted threads saturated\r\nwith pus were tied round the wrists of children to whom it was\r\ndesired to communicate the disease.[41]\r\n\r\nDr. Thomas Nettleton, of Halifax, Yorkshire, was an early and\r\nenergetic inoculator. He prepared his patients by vomiting,\r\npurging, and bleeding. He disliked Maitland’s small punctures, and\r\nmade gashes an inch long--one in the arm and one in the opposite\r\nleg, and inserted bits of cotton steeped in pus, and covered them\r\nup with plaster and rollers. It was his design to produce large\r\nwounds with copious discharges, so that peccant matter might be\r\nfreely evacuated. He was well satisfied with his heroic practice,\r\nand a record of his cases was sent to the Royal Society[42]--a\r\nrecord from which any reader will be apt to conclude that there\r\nwas little to choose between Nettleton’s inoculations and smallpox\r\nitself. He made no pretence that inoculation induced a trifling\r\nailment, but only one less serious than the spontaneous disease,\r\ncongratulating himself on having conveyed some sixty inoculated\r\npatients through grave peril; whilst, he wrote--\r\n\r\n  In Halifax, since the beginning of last winter, 276 have had the\r\n  smallpox, and out of that number 43 have died. In Rochdale, a\r\n  small neighbouring market town, 177 have had the distemper, and\r\n  38 have died. It is to be noted that in this town [Halifax] the\r\n  smallpox have been more favourable this season than usual, and in\r\n  Leeds they have been more than usually mortal; but upon a medium\r\n  there have died nearly 22 out of every 100 in these three towns,\r\n  which is about a fifth part of all that have been infected in the\r\n  natural way.[43]\r\n\r\nEnglish experience quickly made an end of the fiction under cover\r\nof which inoculation had been introduced--that it was attended\r\nwith no risk, and might be performed by any old woman. Dr. Jurin,\r\nsecretary of the Royal Society, and a steady advocate of the\r\npractice, thus laid down the conditions considered essential to\r\nsuccess--conditions arrived at through stress of suffering and\r\ndisaster--\r\n\r\n  Great care ought to be taken to inoculate none but persons of a\r\n  good habit of body, and free, not only from any apparent, but, as\r\n  far as can be judged, from any latent disease.\r\n\r\n  The body, especially if plethoric, ought to be prepared by proper\r\n  evacuations--as bleeding, purging, vomiting, etc.--though in many\r\n  cases there will be occasion for very little or none of these, it\r\n  being sufficient to enjoin a temperate diet and proper regimen.\r\n  But this must be left to the judgment of the physician.\r\n\r\n  The utmost caution ought to be used in the choice of proper\r\n  matter to communicate the infection. It should be taken from a\r\n  young subject, otherwise perfectly sound and healthful, who has\r\n  the smallpox in the most favourable manner. When the pustules are\r\n  properly maturated, and just upon the turn, or soon after, two or\r\n  three of them should be ripped with a glover’s needle or small\r\n  lancet, and a couple of small pledgets of lint or cotton are to\r\n  be well moistened with the matter, and immediately put into a\r\n  little vial or box, and carried in the warm hand or bosom of the\r\n  operator to the house of the person to be inoculated.[44]\r\n\r\nThe publication of these conditions was little short of a practical\r\nsurrender, and the opponents of inoculation were not slow to avail\r\nthemselves of the advantage. What had been proclaimed the easy\r\nand universal defence against smallpox proved hedged about with\r\nprecautions and preparations for which only health with wealth\r\nwas equal. Where was the profit, argued Francis Howgrave, of a\r\npractice which leaves the feeble and delicate and poor to their\r\nfate, which makes the well sick, and wounds those that are whole,\r\nwhilst smallpox in the natural way very rarely affects life where\r\nthe habit of body and constitution are good.[45] Isaac Massey was\r\nespecially indignant over Jurin’s comparison of the mortality of\r\nsmallpox with the mortality of inoculation. Jurin reckoned that\r\nout of every 100 who took smallpox, 20 died, whilst only 2 in 100\r\ndied from the effects of inoculation. “He forgets,” said Massey,\r\n“that the inoculated are picked lives. If this be fair, Hang fair!”\r\nMassey was right. It was absurd to institute a comparison between\r\nthe common smallpox, comprising that of the poor and neglected, and\r\nthe well-fed and carefully tended subjects of inoculation. Massey,\r\ntoo, was strong in his own experience, saying--\r\n\r\n  I have a list of the names of 32 children, who are all that have\r\n  had the smallpox during the last two years [1727] in Christ’s\r\n  Hospital, and every one recovered. I have had, besides, 17 or 18\r\n  more in my private business, of whom only one died. Here, then,\r\n  we have 49 cases of natural smallpox and but 1 death.[46]\r\n\r\nEmphatic likewise was his protest against the exaggeration of the\r\ninoculators.\r\n\r\n  A natural simple smallpox seldom kills, unless under very ill\r\n  management, or when some lurking evil that was quiet before is\r\n  roused in the fluids and confederated with the pocky ferment.[47]\r\n\r\nAt this point we may see the judgment and the fears of the English\r\npeople had gone against inoculation, and the practice appeared\r\ndestined to gradual extinction. According to the inoculators, their\r\nwork was thus summarised--\r\n\r\n    182 inoculations in 1721 and ’22, with 3 deaths.\r\n    292      ”       in 1723,         with 6 deaths.\r\n     40      ”       in 1724,         with 1 death.\r\n\r\nPrince Frederick and Prince William were among the inoculated of\r\n1724.\r\n\r\n    256 inoculations in 1725 and ’26, with 4 deaths.\r\n    124      ”       in 1727 and ’28, with 3 deaths.\r\n\r\nDr. Scheuchzer, in 1729 tabulated[48] the cases and results of\r\nthese years, 1721-28, as follows--\r\n\r\n    ---------------+--------+---------+---------+-------+-------\r\n                   |   No.  |Success- |   Had   |       |\r\n         Age.      |operated|fully in-|imperfect|Did not| Died.\r\n                   |  upon. |oculated.|Smallpox.| take. |\r\n    ---------------+--------+---------+---------+-------+-------\r\n    Under 1 year,  |   24   |    24   |     0   |   0   |   2\r\n    1 to 2,   ”    |   34   |    33   |     0   |   1   |   4\r\n    2 to 3,   ”    |   65   |    65   |     0   |   0   |   1\r\n    3 to 4,   ”    |   91   |    88   |     0   |   3   |   1\r\n    4 to 5,   ”    |   65   |    63   |     0   |   2   |   1\r\n    5 to 10,  ”    |  257   |   249   |     3   |   5   |   3\r\n    10 to 15, ”    |  140   |   131   |     1   |   8   |   1\r\n    15 to 20, ”    |  104   |    95   |     3   |   6   |   2\r\n    20 and upwards,|  110   |    91   |     6   |  13   |   2\r\n    Unknown,       |    7   |     6   |     0   |   1   |   0\r\n                   |  ---   |   ---   |    --   |  --   |  --\r\n                   |  897   |   845   |    13   |  39   |  17\r\n    ---------------+--------+---------+---------+-------+-------\r\n\r\nThus stood the account by the inoculators’ own showing, and it\r\nwas by no means a satisfactory balance-sheet. What strikes one\r\npainfully in looking over it, is the vast preponderance of the\r\nyoung and defenceless (780 out of 897) upon whom the abominable\r\nexperiment was tried. “Helplessness which commands the protection\r\nof the brave is the opportunity of the investigating sneak.”\r\nWhilst the inoculators argued laboriously that if some danger\r\nattended artificial smallpox, it was trifling to that attached\r\nto the spontaneous disease (among other obvious replies), it was\r\nmaintained that only after much wider experience could it be\r\nknown what were the precise effects of inoculation. Inoculation,\r\nas introduced by Maitland in 1721, had proved vastly different\r\nafter acquaintance, and there was no telling what remained to be\r\nrevealed. As Dr. Wagstaffe observed--\r\n\r\n  Had it always been slight, gentle, safe, and useful, with all\r\n  those alluring epithets bestowed on it; had none had above\r\n  a hundred or two hundred pustules, and no one died of it in\r\n  the space of several years; and had there been no instance of\r\n  any one’s being ever again infected with smallpox who had any\r\n  pustules at all, how few soever, raised by inoculation, nobody\r\n  would sooner have subscribed to the practice than myself.[49]\r\n\r\nThe primal promise that the inoculated were thereafter proof\r\nagainst smallpox was speedily belied, but that difficulty was\r\ndisposed of by the assertion that inoculation in such cases must\r\nhave been imperfect, for it was impossible for any one to have\r\nsmallpox twice. The admission of fatalities from inoculation was\r\nvery tardily made; and they were generally referred to some cause\r\nperversely concealed from the inoculator, which, had he known,\r\nwould have prevented his operation. Then, the manifest fatalities\r\nwere naturally suspected to stand for a larger number sedulously\r\nkept out of sight. As Massey put it--\r\n\r\n  The ill success of inoculation is very partially and sparingly\r\n  given to the world. The operator will not tell it, who lives by\r\n  the practice; nor will the relations, to whose authority the\r\n  mischief is owing, be fond of revealing that to the public, which\r\n  is grief to them in private.[50]\r\n\r\nFortunately for the public, several of the mishaps occurred in\r\n“good society,” and were too conspicuous to be hushed up or\r\ndenied. Miss Rigby died eight weeks after inoculation, “miserably\r\ndisordered by the operation.” A son of the Duke of Bridgewater\r\nand a son of the Earl of Sunderland likewise perished; and a\r\nservant of Lord Bathurst died of confluent smallpox “consequent on\r\nengraftment.” Such incidents struck terror everywhere, and caused\r\nwise and timid alike to face the ills they knew rather than risk\r\ncertain peril for uncertain advantage.\r\n\r\nMaitland returned to Scotland, his native country, in 1726,\r\nand, going among his relations in Aberdeenshire, showed off his\r\nskill by inoculating six children. One of them, Adam, son of\r\nWilliam Urquhart of Meldrum, aged 18 months, sickened on the\r\nseventh, and died on the eighth day. There was a great outcry,\r\nand Maitland tried to excuse himself by asserting that Adam was\r\nafflicted with hydrocephalus, which had been improperly concealed\r\nfrom him. Anyhow, the Aberdeenshire folk were satisfied with\r\ntheir experience, and recommended “Charlie Maitland to keep\r\nhis new-fangled remedy for the English in future.” He was more\r\nfortunate in the west of Scotland, where he “inoculated four\r\nchildren of a noble family,” who escaped alive. The Scots, however,\r\nwere deaf to his persuasions, and he made no headway among them. At\r\na later date, 1733, inoculation began to be practised in and about\r\nDumfries, and occasionally elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland little more was effected than in Scotland. It was said\r\nthat 25 inoculations took place between 1723 and 1728 with 3\r\nfatalities. Dr. Bryan Robinson inoculated five children in Dublin\r\nin 1725, and was the death of two of them.[51]\r\n\r\nInoculation met with faint acceptance on the Continent. Maitland\r\nwent over to Hanover in 1724 and inoculated Prince Frederick and\r\neight children of Baron de Schulenberg. In France the practice had\r\nbeen discussed by Dr. Boyer so far back as 1717; and in 1723 the\r\nEnglish experiments were recounted in Paris with much enthusiasm\r\nby Dr. de la Coste, evoking a declaration from the College of\r\nPhysicians, “that for the benefit of the public, it was lawful to\r\nmake trials of inoculation.” A commencement was about to be made\r\nin the hospitals under the Sanction of the Regent, the Duke of\r\nOrleans, when his death put a stop to the design. Soon after Dr.\r\nHecquet published _Raisons de Doute contre l’Inoculation_, which,\r\ncoupled with bad reports from England, made an end of the project.\r\n\r\nIf a London journalist had been called upon in 1728 to report upon\r\nInoculation, he might have written as follows--\r\n\r\nSeven years ago the practice was introduced to this country under\r\npowerful auspices. It was confidently averred that anyone might\r\nhave his blood infected with the virus of smallpox, that a trifling\r\nailment would ensue, and that thenceforward he would be secure\r\nfrom smallpox in the natural form. Experience rapidly belied these\r\npromises. The trifling ailment proved, in many cases, a serious\r\nailment--so serious that physicians tried to anticipate and\r\nmitigate its severity by a preliminary regimen of bleeding, purging\r\nand vomiting. So exhausting and hazardous is the whole operation,\r\nthat only sound and vigorous constitutions are considered fit for\r\nit; and the delicate and feeble, who require protection most, are\r\nadvised to submit themselves as of old to the ordinary course of\r\nnature. Moreover, the induced smallpox is occasionally as severe\r\nas the spontaneous; the pustules are multitudinous, and sometimes\r\nconfluent, with death for the issue. Fear may exaggerate the risks\r\nof inoculation, but more are believed to have perished than the\r\ninoculators are willing to confess. Again, many are not susceptible\r\nof inoculation, and though the infection fails to operate in their\r\nblood as desired, they do not always escape injury: they find their\r\nhealth disordered--are rendered sickly and uncomfortable. Worst\r\nof all, what none at first reckoned on, the artificial smallpox\r\nturns out to be infectious, and begets natural smallpox in those\r\nwho are with the inoculated. Thus, the very means taken to limit\r\nthe disease become a cause of its extension. Smallpox was more\r\nthan usually prevalent in Hertford in 1721, and in London in 1724,\r\nand there was fair reason to conjecture that it was extensively\r\ndisseminated by inoculation. Lastly, it is doubtful whether even\r\nsuccessful inoculation protects from subsequent smallpox; for it is\r\nmaintained that some of the inoculated have already fallen victims\r\nto the natural disorder. In short, the preventive appears to have\r\nso many drawbacks that it is questionable whether it is not worse\r\nthan the malady; and it is probable that in a year or two it will\r\npass into forgetfulness in common with many other remedies as\r\nhighly extolled on early and imperfect acquaintance.\r\n\r\nSo much might have been stated and prognosticated in 1728: how the\r\nprognostic failed to be verified remains to be told.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[40] _Philosophical Transactions_, No. 375, 1723.\r\n\r\n[41] _An Account of Inoculation in Scotland._ By A.

The revival was gradual, and may be\r\nsaid to have acquired definition about 1748, under the powerful\r\napproval of Dr. Mead. In the score of years from 1728 to 1748,\r\nit is not to be imagined that the practice was abandoned: there\r\nwere always a few repeating the attempt to have smallpox without\r\nthe penalties of smallpox, but success was not conspicuous or\r\nencouraging. Inoculation was introduced to a generation specially\r\ndisposed to receive it; and it was only allowed to slip for a time\r\nunder the compulsion of manifest disaster. Perhaps there never was\r\na people with such a taste for dodges in favour of health as the\r\nEnglish of last century: the common intelligence was invested\r\nin quackery. Even Wesley found time to dabble in medicine, and\r\nto compile a volume of prescriptions for his followers, entitled\r\n_Primitive Physic_--a piquant mixture of sense with absurdity\r\nand credulity. Our forefathers had no clear conception of the\r\nconnection of physical well-being with physical well-doing,\r\nand many of the essential conditions of health were unknown to\r\nthem. Their physical afflictions were regarded as mysterious\r\ndispensations to be endured with resignation or frustrated with\r\nmedicines. The same attitude of mind is far from uncommon at the\r\npresent day, and many will recollect how, ere sanitary science\r\nattained repute, it was considered profane to assert that typhus\r\nwas subject to control, and that cholera might be suppressed;\r\nwhilst a drug to subdue either would be heard of with gratitude.\r\nSuperstition has rarely had any objection to the apothecary.\r\n\r\nAn incident passed over in histories, although far more inwardly\r\ncharacteristic of the mind of the 18th century than a multitude of\r\nthe superficialities wherewith their pages are cumbered, is that of\r\nJoanna Stephens and her remedies for the stone. Her cures were so\r\nremarkable and (on evidence) so indisputable, that a general demand\r\narose for the revelation of her secret for the public benefit.\r\nThis revelation Mrs. Stephens agreed to make on receipt of £5000\r\nas compensation; and a subscription was started, to which Fellows\r\nof the Royal Society, physicians, noblemen, bishops, ladies, and\r\nkindly folk of all orders set their names. Such, however, was the\r\nunanimity and anxiety to possess the Stephens secret, that it was\r\npronounced a national concern, and Parliament was invoked to supply\r\nthe requisite funds; whereon an Act was passed “for providing a\r\nreward to Joanna Stephens upon a proper discovery to be made by her\r\nof the medicines prepared by her for the cure of the stone.” The\r\ndiscovery was duly disclosed to appointed trustees, one of whom was\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury, and the £5000 was paid over in 1739; and\r\nhere we have the heads of the precious revelation--\r\n\r\n  My medicines are a Powder, a Decoction, and a Pill.\r\n\r\n  The Powder consists of egg-shells and snails, both calcined.\r\n\r\n  The Decoction is made by boiling camomile, fennel, parsley, and\r\n  burdock leaves (together with a ball, which consists of soap,\r\n  swine’s cresses burnt to a blackness, and honey) in water.\r\n\r\n  The Pills consist of snails calcined, wild carrot seeds, burdock\r\n  seeds, ashen keys, hips and hawes, all burnt to a blackness, soap\r\n  and honey.\r\n\r\n    JOANNA STEPHENS.\r\n\r\n  16th June, 1739.\r\n\r\nThe public were apparently satisfied with the purchase, but\r\nwith the usual levity of credulity forgot Mrs. Stephens and her\r\nmarvellous cures in the pursuit of fresh nostrums. Fashions in\r\nmedicine are on a par with fashions in dress, and have only\r\noccasional reference to the permanence and veracity of nature.\r\n\r\nThe revival of inoculation in England was stimulated by reports\r\nfrom abroad. For instance, in the _Gentleman’s Magazine_ it was\r\nstated that in 1737 there were inoculated in Philadelphia--\r\n\r\n    Men and Women,            32\r\n    Children under twelve,    64\r\n    Negroes,                  32\r\n\r\nand that out of the 128 only one Negro died. Again, in the same\r\nmagazine for 1738 we read--\r\n\r\n  In Barbados in March last there were upwards of 3000 persons\r\n  down in the smallpox, where inoculation is practised with great\r\n  success.\r\n\r\nSuch reports, whilst secure from examination, were none the\r\nless effective over the public imagination. There was a report\r\npublished by Dr. Mead in 1747, which derived great credit from his\r\nendorsement, and which continues to be cited to the present day\r\nas proof for inoculation, but which is a model of convenient and\r\ncircumstantial vagueness worthy of Defoe. Thus Mead’s story runs--\r\n\r\n  The following relation was communicated to me by a gentleman\r\n  of great credit. He was a merchant at St. Christopher’s in the\r\n  West Indies, and in the making of sugar employed a great number\r\n  of slaves. In one year, when the smallpox raged with more than\r\n  ordinary violence in the neighbouring islands, with his own hands\r\n  he inoculated three hundred of them, from five to sixty years\r\n  of age, with such success, that not one of them died, though\r\n  most of them were negroes. And whereas all the Americans suffer\r\n  this distemper in a most terrible manner, yet experience shows,\r\n  that it is much more dangerous when it attacks the natives of\r\n  Africa.[52]\r\n\r\nMead held positions which later and more exact inquiry rendered\r\nuntenable. He would not allow that the pus of smallpox could\r\ncommunicate any disease but smallpox, _if_ taken from a proper\r\nsubject--a condition that required supernatural assistance to\r\nfulfil. He maintained that inoculation generated true smallpox,\r\nand that as no one could have smallpox twice, therefore no one\r\ncould have smallpox after inoculation, and that reports to the\r\ncontrary were not credible. It now goes without saying that in this\r\ncontention Mead was at fault, but at the time his confidence was\r\nnot inexcusable; and whilst defending and recommending inoculation,\r\nhe made admissions which fully justified those who resisted and\r\ncondemned his counsels. Let us not forget that the following\r\npassage was published in 1747, and was the fruit of six-and-twenty\r\nyears of experience in the best London practice. Thus Mead wrote--\r\n\r\n  It ought not to be omitted, that boils and swellings under\r\n  the ears and in the arm-pits arise more frequently after the\r\n  distemper procured by art than after that which comes of its own\r\n  accord; for this reason, as I suppose, that the venomous matter\r\n  is pushed forward with less force, which disadvantages Nature\r\n  makes amends for in this way.\r\n\r\n  Therefore all possible means are to be used to ripen such tumours\r\n  of whatever kind they are: if this cannot be done, they must be\r\n  opened by incision; and when all the matter is drawn out, the\r\n  body must be purged by proper medicines, which are to be oftener\r\n  repeated in this than in the natural disease.[53]\r\n\r\nHow just are the judgments of Divine Order! These boils, swellings,\r\nand tumours, were the sequences of the violated harmony of the\r\nbody--of the faithless anticipation, the meddling and muddling with\r\nits processes.\r\n\r\nAn extensive series of inoculations took place in 1742-45 in the\r\nsouth of England. Smallpox was prevalent in Winchester and adjacent\r\ntowns, and Dr. Langrish operated freely on whoever resorted to\r\nhim. In Portsmouth, Chichester, Guildford, Petersfield, and\r\nWinchester, it was said that at least 2,000 were poxed, and that\r\nonly two pregnant women perished, who, as usual, “were inoculated\r\ncontrary to the advice of their physician.” The ill results, wrote\r\nBishop Maddox, “were only such as might reasonably be supposed to\r\nhave been worse had those operated on had smallpox in the natural\r\nway”--such being the euphemism wherewith boils, tumours, and other\r\nsequelæ were accounted for.\r\n\r\nThe reviving favour for inoculation was indicated in this paragraph\r\nfrom the newspapers of 13th April, in 1744--\r\n\r\n  Fourteen children, three years old, having been inoculated for\r\n  the smallpox in the Foundling Hospital, Hatton Garden, all with\r\n  good success, the Governors have resolved to have all their\r\n  children inoculated at the same age.\r\n\r\nAn important movement was made in 1746 with the opening of a\r\nSmallpox Hospital in Cold Bath Fields at which “the benefit of\r\ninoculation” was offered to the poor. At first those who applied\r\nwere taken into the house, and nursed through their self-inflicted\r\nillness, but the proximity of the veritable smallpox, the regimen,\r\nand the seclusion were sufficient to deter applicants: those,\r\nhowever, who have a hobby to ride grow reckless in presence of\r\nobstacles, and by-and-by inoculation was offered to all comers, who\r\nwere dismissed to recover and diffuse infection in their own homes.\r\n\r\nWith the revival of inoculation there was a revival of the\r\ncontroversy as to its lawfulness theologically. Dr. Isaac Maddox,\r\nBishop of Worcester, preached a sermon on behalf of the Smallpox\r\nHospital in St. Andrew’s, Holborn, on 5th March, 1752,[54] which\r\nexcited considerable attention. He showed the necessity for\r\nsuch an hospital for the poor and forsaken of the great city--a\r\nnecessity incontestable. He mentioned (and the remark supplies a\r\ncurious note on the hygiene of the time) that ventilators were\r\nto be introduced, and it was expected that the access of fresh\r\nair might benefit the patients. The return of the Hospital for\r\n1752 showed 344 admissions, with 262 recoveries, and 82 deaths--a\r\nproportion that does not contrast disadvantageously with 19th\r\ncentury hospitals, fortified with sanitary appliances. During\r\nthe same year 112 inoculations were effected at the Hospital.\r\nThe Bishop had been assured by three eminent surgeons that they\r\nhad inoculated 1500 persons with only 3 fatalities, one of them\r\n(Sergeant Ranby) having accomplished one thousand without a mishap.\r\nThe practice was without doubt lawful, for it averted a dangerous\r\ndisease, and some risk was inseparable from all methods of cure.\r\nThe practice had already done much to lessen smallpox, and, as it\r\nbecame commoner, it would do more. The result of the sermon was a\r\nsubscription of £809 for the charity at the subsequent dinner in\r\nthe Drapers’ Hall.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop was singularly at fault in his ascription of diminished\r\nmortality to inoculation, for, in 1752, smallpox was more than\r\nunusually rife in the Metropolis, and its prevalence was not\r\nunreasonably attributed to infection from the inoculated. In 1751\r\nthe deaths from smallpox in London were 998; they rose to 3538 in\r\n1752; declined to 774 in 1753; and rose to 2359 in 1754.\r\n\r\nDr. Doddridge lent his powerful influence in favour of inoculation;\r\nand, considering the unqualified assertions of medical men as\r\nto its benefits and harmlessness, it cannot be said he was\r\nblameworthy. The audacious assurance with which many of them bore\r\ndown opposition overcame the simple-minded, who argued as if the\r\nworld were constituted after the pattern of their own innocent\r\nhearts. That smallpox frequently followed inoculation is now known\r\nbeyond dispute, and yet Dr. Kirkpatrick wrote--\r\n\r\n  I have heard myself a great many rumours of the inoculated being\r\n  naturally infected afterwards, which upon examination proved just\r\n  as many lies.[55]\r\n\r\nHow could women and divines resist such evidence?\r\n\r\nA voluble antagonist of inoculation was the Rev. Theodore Delafaye\r\nof Canterbury. He preached a sermon in that city on the 3rd of\r\nJune, 1753, from the text, “Let us do evil that good may come”\r\n(Rom. iii. 8), and published it under the title of _Inoculation an\r\nIndefensible Practice_. He was in turn attacked by the inoculators,\r\nand in 1754 issued _A Vindication_ of 200 pages, in which he\r\nreturned more than he received with vigour rather than discretion.\r\nHis conclusion was--\r\n\r\n  Inoculation I maintain to be, in a religious and moral view,\r\n  a self-destructive, inhuman, and impious machination, and in\r\n  a physical one an unreasonable, unnatural, unlawful, most\r\n  hazardous, ineffectual, fruitless, uncertain, unnecessary device;\r\n  in a word, a practice which nature recoils at, which reason\r\n  opposes, and which religion condemns.\r\n\r\nWe sometimes read that inoculation was denounced as Atheism, and\r\nwe are expected to reprobate or to smile at the bigotry; and,\r\nwhilst we may not approve of the stigma, we may at the same time\r\nrecognise the honest sense in which it might be affixed. Some who\r\nspoke of inoculation as Atheistic felt more vividly than they\r\ncould otherwise describe, that it was an infraction of the deeper\r\nsanctity of Nature, where man’s hand cannot enter and prosper, and\r\nthat those who made the attempt could have no proper sense of Him\r\nin whom they lived, and moved, and had their being. Moreover, if we\r\nare to admit that they who thus expressed themselves are blameable\r\nfor excessive vehemence, what are we to say of the more numerous\r\nparty who did not hesitate to pronounce inoculation a discovery\r\neffected in the human mind by God himself? If it was reasonable to\r\nspeak of the practice as Theistic, why should it be fanatical to\r\nassert the contrary, and maintain that it involved a negation of\r\nDivine Providence? Dr. Kirkpatrick, with the sycophancy which was\r\nthe custom of his age, praised George II. for “the benevolent, and\r\neven celestial disposition,” which induced him to patronise “the\r\nwonderful and probably Heaven-descended practice of inoculation;”\r\nand extolled “its equal simplicity and success” as demonstrating\r\n“to a reflective mind the goodness of Providence in making what may\r\nbe so often necessary, so easily accomplished.”[56] It would not\r\nbe difficult to cite scores of confessions of gratitude to God for\r\ninoculation, but to what purpose?\r\n\r\nWhat we think good we necessarily ascribe to God; and we do well;\r\nbut much that we think good is otherwise, or is only partially\r\ngood; and what then? Why, we are undeceived and corrected by\r\nexperience. We put our notion of what is good to the test of\r\npractice, and God answers us in the event--justifies, amends, or\r\nconfounds us. Thus with inoculation. It was fair that those who\r\nthought it good should refer it to God, and thank him for it; and\r\nit was equally fair that those who thought it bad should say it\r\nwas none of his--that it was at variance with his order, and a\r\ndiscredit to the intelligence of those who imputed it to Him. How\r\nwas the issue to be determined? Only by God himself. And how would\r\nHe speak? In the results of experience wherein his will would\r\nbecome manifest beyond equivocation.\r\n\r\nIn 1754 inoculation obtained full recognition from the London\r\nCollege of Physicians. It was declared “that experience had refuted\r\nthe arguments urged against the practice; that it was now more\r\nextensively employed in England than ever; and that it was highly\r\nbeneficial to mankind.” The fence of hesitation was thrown down,\r\nand to be inoculated became the distinction of all who wished to\r\nbe numbered with the enlightened and prudent. That the Circassians\r\nwere famous for their beauty, and that they practised inoculation,\r\nwas a staple argument, and an irresistible, with a multitude of\r\nEnglishwomen. Opposition was chiefly confined to the lower orders,\r\nwho objected to have the inoculated at large among them, and in\r\nsome places threatened to demolish the houses where inoculation\r\nwas performed.[57] Occasionally a medical practitioner acquired\r\nreputation as an inoculator, and was resorted to by patients from a\r\ndistance, and his operations were not regarded with much favour by\r\nhis neighbours. Thus the physicians and surgeons of Newbury, Berks,\r\nwere compelled by their townsmen to promise to inoculate no one who\r\nhad not resided in Newbury at least two years.\r\n\r\nThe new practice created much business, and its distribution\r\nexcited some jealousy. Physicians complained that surgeons\r\ninoculated without their assistance, and surgeons that apothecaries\r\ndid so likewise. Dr. Kirkpatrick laid down the rule that every\r\nrightly conducted inoculation involved the employment of physician,\r\nsurgeon, and apothecary--the physician to prepare and prescribe\r\nfor the patient, the surgeon to cut, infuse, and dress, and the\r\napothecary to make up the medicines. Some, however, dispensed\r\nwith all three, and effected their own inoculations. A boy poxed\r\nfourteen of his school-fellows in sport, and amateur inoculators,\r\nmale and female, multiplied. As an example of amateur procedure,\r\nDr. Kirkpatrick relates that a gentleman of Kent sent his servant,\r\nSilvanus, a young man, to Mrs. Chapman, at Heathfield, to be\r\ninoculated. He had to ride thirteen miles, and arrived hot and\r\nfatigued at the house of the inoculatrix. As he had taken his\r\npreparatory physic at his master’s, Mrs. Chapman desired him to get\r\nready at once for the operation, which he begged her to defer as\r\nhe was in such a heat. She replied that he must be inoculated that\r\nvery day, Tuesday, or remain until the following week, for Tuesday\r\nwas her lucky day. The poor fellow allowed himself to be persuaded,\r\nand was then and there inoculated: severe smallpox ensued, and he\r\ndied.[58]\r\n\r\nThus was inoculation revived and established, and smallpox with\r\nit--established and diffused.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[52] _Medical Works of Dr. Mead_, Vol. ii. p. 146.

Dr.\r\nRobert Sutton practised surgery and pharmacy at Debenham, in\r\nSuffolk, and went into inoculation with such energy that between\r\n1757 and 1767 he operated on 2514 patients. His son, Robert, set up\r\nas inoculator at Bury St. Edmunds, where he did a large business;\r\nbut a second son, Daniel, was the genius of the household. He had\r\nbeen acting as assistant to Mr. Bumstead at Oxford, and returned\r\nto his father in 1763 enthusiastic over a new plan of inoculation\r\nwhereby the time of preparation was to be shortened, whilst the\r\npatients were to live in the open air. Old Sutton showed no favour\r\nfor the projected innovation, whereon Daniel opened an inoculating\r\nhouse on his own account at Ingatestone, in Essex, advertising\r\nhimself as inoculator on a new, safe, and sure method. The\r\nspeculation answered. In 1764 he took 2000 guineas, and in 1765 his\r\nreceipts were £6300. His fame spread throughout the country, and so\r\nmany resorted to him that lodgings were scarcely to be had in and\r\naround Ingatestone. His practice in Kent was also extensive, and he\r\nwas obliged to employ assistants. To crown his enterprise, he kept\r\na parson--the Rev. Robert Houlton, to puff his skill and success.\r\nAccording to Houlton, the business of Daniel Sutton during three\r\nyears was as follows--\r\n\r\n    Inoculated in 1764,    1629\r\n        ”         1765,    4347\r\n        ”         1766,    7816\r\n                         ------\r\n                         13,792\r\n\r\nto which number was added 6000 inoculated by Sutton’s assistants,\r\nmaking a total of 20,000, without, said Houlton, a single death.[59]\r\n\r\nSutton was denounced as a quack, and if to reserve as one’s own,\r\nand to traffic in what is proclaimed to be for the common advantage\r\nof mankind, constitutes a quack, Sutton was one. Nevertheless, he\r\nwas successful, and his success begot so much jealousy that he was\r\nindicted at the Chelmsford quarter sessions, but acquitted with the\r\nthanks of the grand jury for the lesson he had taught the Faculty.\r\n\r\nMuch ingenuity was exercised in ferreting out Sutton’s secret. His\r\nsecret, so far as it was anything, was an open one; and supposing\r\nit necessary to infect men’s blood with variolous pus, and then\r\nto operate for their recovery, there would be much to say for\r\nSutton’s procedure. His patients were obliged to go through a\r\nstrict preparatory regimen for a fortnight, during which every\r\nkind of animal food, with the exception of milk, and all fermented\r\nliquors and spices were forbidden. Fruit of all sorts was allowed,\r\nunless on days when purges were taken. In the course of a fortnight\r\na powder was thrice administered at bed-time, and a dose of salts\r\non the succeeding morning. When the days of preparation were\r\naccomplished, the patient was taken to the inoculating house, where\r\nin the public room was found an array of people in various stages\r\nof smallpox. From one of these sufferers, the operator selected a\r\npustule to his mind, opened it with his lancet, and, turning to\r\nthe patient to be poxed, raised the cuticle on the outer part of\r\nhis arm with the moist lancet, and pressed it down with his finger.\r\nThis was the entire operation: no plaster or bandage was applied:\r\nand from that moment the patient was pronounced proof against\r\nsmallpox, even if he should lie in bed with one suffering from the\r\ndisease. Of course there remained the variolous affection to be\r\ndealt with. The regimen of preparation was continued unchanged, and\r\na pill was taken nightly until the fever came on. None were allowed\r\nto rest in bed, except for sleep, but had to walk abroad and enjoy\r\nfresh air, even in winter weather. If a patient was too sick to go\r\nalone, he was supported by attendants; and when the fever was at\r\nits height, he was encouraged to drink copiously of cold water.\r\n\r\nMuch more was attributed to Sutton’s pills and powders than to\r\nhis regimen, and these were no more than preparations of antimony\r\nand mercury, with which practitioners of all orders were only\r\ntoo familiar. Sutton, however, contrived to maintain his mystery\r\nuntil he had no longer occasion for it, and lived to recognise\r\na successor in Jenner. He removed to London in 1767 in hope of\r\nenlarging his income, but like many other provincial celebrities,\r\ndiscovered that he had better have remained where he shone without\r\nrivals and detractors.\r\n\r\nThe Sutton regimen, so far as it might be described as “cool,”\r\ncame into general favour, whilst what was called the hot regimen\r\nof warm rooms, bed, and cordials was correspondingly discredited.\r\nContrasting the two methods, Sir George Baker, writing in 1771,\r\nobserved--\r\n\r\n  I found that in the counties of Norfolk, Suffolk, and Essex, many\r\n  thousands of people of all ages and constitutions, and some of\r\n  them with every apparent disadvantage, had been inoculated with\r\n  general good success; whereas at Blandford, in Dorset, out of 384\r\n  who were inoculated, 13 actually died, and many others narrowly\r\n  escaped with their lives from confluent smallpox.[60]\r\n\r\nA famous inoculator was Dr. Thomas Dimsdale of Hertford, a Quaker\r\nof easy principles. He published in 1766 a treatise entitled _The\r\nPresent Method of Inoculating for the Smallpox_--an exposition of\r\nthe most approved practice of the time, which, by one of those\r\ncurious felicities of circumstance, conferred on him a European\r\nreputation; and in 1781, _Tracts on Inoculation_--a record of his\r\nopinions and adventures at home and abroad.\r\n\r\nDimsdale desired to universalise inoculation, but with\r\ncircumspection. He recommended that the inhabitants of a suitable\r\ndistrict should be dealt with as a whole and at once. That the\r\nnames of all should be taken, and on a certain day that everyone,\r\nwho had not had smallpox, should be inoculated. That the district\r\nshould then continue in quarantine for about three weeks, at the\r\nend of which the danger and the fear of smallpox would cease, until\r\nan unpolluted generation should afresh accumulate. The project was\r\nnot mere dreaming. Dimsdale was a man of influence and energy, and\r\neffected several complete inoculations of villages and parishes in\r\nHertfordshire according to his plan. In later years, he combined\r\nbanking with medicine, and the firm of Dimsdale, Fowler, and Co. of\r\nCornhill originated with him and perpetuates his name.\r\n\r\nDimsdale’s practice lay chiefly among the upper classes, to whom he\r\nmade matters very comfortable. As he wrote--\r\n\r\n  I do not enjoin any restriction in respect to diet, nor direct\r\n  any medicines to be taken before the time of operation by such as\r\n  appear to be in a proper state of health.[61]\r\n\r\nHe was satisfied with administering a powder on the evening of\r\nthe day on which a patient was inoculated, consisting of calomel,\r\ntartar emetic, and crabs’ claws.\r\n\r\nWhilst labouring to popularise inoculation, Dimsdale was strongly\r\nopposed to the trade therein passing to unauthorised hands--simple,\r\nsafe, and salutary though he asserted it to be. Thus he averred--\r\n\r\n  The mischiefs arising from the practice of inoculation by the\r\n  illiterate and ignorant are beyond conception.[62]\r\n\r\nHow illiteracy should affect inoculation, he left to conjecture.\r\nHe apparently forgot that the practice was derived from people who\r\nmade no pretence to literature, and whose efficiency and success\r\nwere, moreover, set forth as warrant and encouragement for English\r\nimitation.\r\n\r\nIn 1775 a Society was formed for General Inoculation, and an\r\nhospital was opened for the purpose at Battle Bridge, on the site\r\nof what is now the Great Northern Railway station, King’s Cross.\r\nDr. Lettsom, a popular Quaker physician, issued an appeal on behalf\r\nof the enterprise, and having invoked Dr. Dimsdale’s approval,\r\na lively controversy ensued between the brethren--personal\r\nrather than profitable. Dimsdale disapproved of indiscriminate\r\ninoculation: he was ready to inoculate the whole world, but\r\nsystematically, and under strict safe-guards. He pointed out that\r\nwhatever might be the advantage to the individual, unless the\r\ninoculated patient was rigorously secluded, he would diffuse the\r\ndisease from which he sought to be delivered, and that the price\r\nof his life might be the destruction of many. Dimsdale’s warnings\r\nwere, however, slightly regarded, and inoculation was pursued with\r\ncriminal recklessness. As Pascal observes, of all the faculties\r\ngiven to man, the most awful in its consequences is the power of\r\nstanding amid a number of facts, and seeing such as we please to\r\nsee, and being blind to the rest.\r\n\r\nSpecially remarkable in connection with the smallpox of\r\nlast century was the exaggerated terror expressed for it by\r\nprofessional inoculators, and the little real terror manifested\r\nby the multitude. It was by no means the most fatal of diseases,\r\nnor was it a large factor in the common mortality. Wherever we\r\ntest the matter by unbiased contemporary evidence, we find the\r\noutcry factitious: the dreadful and desolating malady from which\r\nJenner delivered his country is merely a fiction continued by\r\nthe vaccinators from the inoculators. For proof let us turn to\r\nthe evidence of Dr. Alexander Monro, Professor of Medicine and\r\nAnatomy in the University of Edinburgh. The Faculty of Medicine in\r\nParis had appointed a commission to inquire into the advantages\r\nof inoculation, which in the course of duty applied to Monro,\r\nwho in response produced and published in 1765 _An Account of\r\nthe Inoculation of Smallpox in Scotland_. He reported that from\r\nthe introduction of the practice by Maitland in 1726, there had\r\nbeen 5554 inoculations effected in Scotland with 72 fatalities;\r\nthat is to say about 140 annually with deaths 1 in 78, according\r\nto the confession of the inoculators themselves. Monro further\r\nstated that the practice was disliked in Scotland as “a tempting\r\nof Providence,” an unwarrantable risk of life for an uncertain\r\nadvantage. Our present interest, however, is in the statistics of\r\ndeaths from smallpox in Edinburgh for a series of twenty years thus\r\nadduced by Monro.\r\n\r\n           Burials      From\r\n           from all   Smallpox.\r\n           Diseases.\r\n    1744     1345       167\r\n    1745     1463       141\r\n    1746     1712[63]   128\r\n    1747     1200        71\r\n    1748     1286       167\r\n    1749     1132       192\r\n    1750     1038        64\r\n    1751     1241       109\r\n    1752     1187       147\r\n    1753     1105        70\r\n           ------      ----\r\n           12,709      1256\r\n\r\n    1754     1215       104\r\n    1755     1187        89\r\n    1756     1316       126\r\n    1757     1267       113\r\n    1758     1001        52\r\n    1759     1136       232\r\n    1760     1123        66\r\n    1761      903         6\r\n    1762     1305       274\r\n    1763     1160       123\r\n           ------      ----\r\n           11,613      1185\r\n\r\nHere we have a piece of valid experience with every advantage to\r\nthe smallpox terrorist: for Edinburgh last century was a city\r\ncontrived as if for the generation and perpetuation of smallpox.\r\nThe population of 55,000 was lodged thickly in flats, in houses\r\nof many storeys, closely built in lanes and courts--a population\r\ndensely compacted as any in Europe, with arrangements for\r\ncleanliness indescribable, at this day perhaps incredible. Yet\r\nin conditions so propitious to smallpox, we see before us the\r\ntotal outcome during a series of twenty years; and reprehensible\r\nas the result may appear to contemporary sanitarians, who hold,\r\nand rightly hold, that all zymotic diseases are preventible, yet\r\nit affected Monro with no anxiety or dismay: nor does the rate\r\nof mortality of old Edinburgh contrast unfavourably with that of\r\nthe modern city. The case of Edinburgh, however, serves to show\r\nthat in all cases when we hear of the ravages of smallpox before\r\nJenner appeared as deliverer, our policy is to insist firmly upon\r\nthe production of special and adequate evidence: it is monstrous\r\nthat the assertions of common quacks, whether inoculators or\r\nvaccinators, should pass into tradition and be accepted as\r\nunquestionable verity.\r\n\r\nWe have, moreover, to observe that the mortality from smallpox in\r\nEdinburgh was infantile mortality: for as Monro testified--\r\n\r\n  The inhabitants of Scotland generally have the smallpox in their\r\n  infancy or childhood; very few adults being seen in this disease.\r\n  Whether this is owing to any particular constitution of the air,\r\n  or of the people, or to the disease not being so much dreaded as\r\n  to cause any to fly from the place where it is, or to the great\r\n  intercourse which must be among the inhabitants of the towns, of\r\n  which several, nay, many families enter to their houses by one\r\n  common stair, while in the villages the peasants are generally\r\n  assistant to their neighbours of whose family any is sick, it is\r\n  not now necessary to inquire.\r\n\r\nNot only were the habits of the people contributory to the\r\ndiffusion of eruptive disorders, but likewise their food, of which\r\noatmeal was the staple, whilst vegetables were few, fruit rare,\r\nand tea unknown. Hence many maladies had free course; and as Dean\r\nRamsay relates, a girl on her arrival at Mrs. Betty Muirheid’s\r\nboarding-school in the Trongate, Glasgow, when asked whether she\r\nhad had smallpox, replied, “Yes, mem, I’ve had the sma’pox, the\r\nnirls [measles], the blabs [nettle-rash], the scaw [itch], the\r\nkink-host [whooping-cough], the fever, the branks [mumps], and the\r\nworm [toothache].”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA last word as to Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. After a residence\r\nof twenty years in Italy, she returned to England to die, 21st\r\nAugust, 1762. On the west side of the north door in Lichfield\r\nCathedral, there is a female figure, in marble, leaning on an urn\r\ninscribed M. W. M. The inscription runs--\r\n\r\n    SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF\r\n    THE RIGHT HONOURABLE\r\n    LADY MARY WORTLEY MONTAGU,\r\n    WHO HAPPILY INTRODUCED, FROM TURKEY,\r\n    INTO THIS COUNTRY,\r\n    THE SALUTARY ART OF INOCULATING THE SMALLPOX.\r\n    CONVINCED OF ITS EFFICACY,\r\n    SHE FIRST TRIED IT WITH SUCCESS\r\n    ON HER OWN CHILDREN,\r\n    AND THEN RECOMMENDED THE PRACTICE OF IT TO\r\n    HER FELLOW-CITIZENS.\r\n    THUS, BY HER EXAMPLE AND ADVICE,\r\n    WE HAVE SOFTENED THE VIRULENCE, AND\r\n    ESCAPED THE DANGER, OF THIS MALIGNANT DISEASE.\r\n    TO PERPETUATE THE MEMORY OF SUCH BENEVOLENCE,\r\n    AND TO EXPRESS HER GRATITUDE\r\n    FOR THE BENEFIT SHE HERSELF RECEIVED FROM\r\n    THIS ALLEVIATING ART,\r\n    THIS MONUMENT IS ERECTED BY\r\n    HENRIETTA INGE,\r\n    RELICT OF THEODORE WILLIAM INGE, ESQ.,\r\n    AND DAUGHTER OF SIR JOHN WROTTESLEY, BART.,\r\n    IN THE YEAR OF OUR LORD,\r\n    MDCCLXXXIX.\r\n\r\nWhilst we do not resort to epitaphs for truth, we may discover in\r\nthem what was taken for truth, or what was wished to be taken for\r\ntruth. We have in the foregoing epitaph the legend which has caught\r\nthe popular fancy, and which is likely to survive corrections\r\ninnumerable. It is the custom of mankind to identify a common\r\nmovement with some prominent or picturesque figure in the movement,\r\nand to suppress the rest. The practice is convenient, but it taints\r\nall history with fable.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt may be said that the practice of inoculation met with no\r\nactive resistance in England during the last thirty years of last\r\ncentury. How widely and deeply it extended it would be difficult to\r\ndetermine. The probability is, that the mass of the population was\r\nuntouched, and that inoculation was limited to the upper and middle\r\nclasses, and to the lower so far as they came under the immediate\r\ninfluence of those above them. We have, perhaps, an index to the\r\ncondition of affairs in Dr. Wm. Buchan’s _Domestic Medicine_, first\r\npublished in 1769, which ran through eighteen editions, amounting\r\nto 80,000 copies, in the author’s life-time. It is not uncommon to\r\nrefer contemptuously to Buchan, but his work was the production\r\nof a man of vigorous good sense with faith in the good sense of\r\nhis readers--a book creditable to the author and to the people who\r\nappreciated him.\r\n\r\nBuchan was an inoculator, a zealous advocate of inoculation, and\r\nearnestly laboured to universalise the practice. In the _Domestic\r\nMedicine_, ed. 1797, he wrote--\r\n\r\n  No discovery can be of general utility while the practice of it\r\n  is kept in the hands of a few. Had Inoculation been practised by\r\n  the same kind of operators in our country as in the countries\r\n  from which we derived it, it had long ago been universal. The\r\n  fears, the jealousies, the prejudices, and the opposite interests\r\n  of the Faculty are, and ever will be, the most effectual\r\n  obstacles to the progress of any salutary discovery. Hence it is\r\n  that Inoculation never became in any manner general in England\r\n  till taken up by men not bred to physic.\r\n\r\nConsistently with this opinion, Buchan strongly advocated domestic\r\npractice, saying--\r\n\r\n  They know very little of the matter, who impute the success of\r\n  modern inoculators to any superior skill, either in preparing the\r\n  patient or communicating the disease. Some of them, indeed, from\r\n  a sordid desire of engrossing the whole practice to themselves,\r\n  pretend to have extraordinary secrets or nostrums for preparing\r\n  persons for inoculation, which never fail of success. But this is\r\n  only a pretence calculated to blind the ignorant and inattentive.\r\n  Common-sense and prudence alone are sufficient both in the\r\n  choice of the subject and management of the operation. Whoever\r\n  is possessed of these may perform this office for his children\r\n  whenever he finds it convenient, _provided they be in a good\r\n  state of health_.\r\n\r\n  This statement is not the result of theory, but of observation.\r\n  Though few physicians have had more opportunities of trying\r\n  inoculation in all its different forms, so little appears to me\r\n  to depend on those generally reckoned important circumstances,\r\n  of preparing the body, communicating the infection by this or\r\n  the other method, etc., that, for several years past, I have\r\n  persuaded parents and nurses to perform the entire operation\r\n  themselves.\r\n\r\n  I have known many instances of mothers inoculating their\r\n  children, and never so much as heard of one bad consequence.\r\n  Common mechanics often, to my knowledge, perform the operation\r\n  with as good success as physicians.\r\n\r\nHaving described the ordinary method of inoculation by incision\r\nwith a lancet dipped in pus, he goes on to say--\r\n\r\n  If fresh matter be applied long enough to the skin, there is no\r\n  occasion for any wound at all. Let a bit of thread, about half\r\n  an inch long, wet with the matter, be immediately applied to the\r\n  arm, midway between the shoulder and the elbow, and covered with\r\n  a piece of common sticking-plaster, and kept on for eight or ten\r\n  days. This will seldom fail to communicate the disease.\r\n\r\n  Instead of multiplying arguments to recommend this practice, I\r\n  shall beg leave to mention the case of my own son, at the time\r\n  an only child. After giving him two gentle purges, I ordered the\r\n  nurse to take a bit of thread which had been previously wet with\r\n  fresh matter from a pock, and to lay it upon his arm, covering it\r\n  with a piece of sticking-plaster. This remained on six or seven\r\n  days, until it was rubbed off by accident. At the usual time\r\n  smallpox made their appearance, and were exceedingly favourable.\r\n  Surely this, which is all that is generally necessary, may be\r\n  done without any skill in medicine.\r\n\r\nThus was smallpox made easy!\r\n\r\nBuchan appealed to the clergy for co-operation as inoculators--\r\n\r\n  The persons to whom we would chiefly recommend the performance\r\n  of this operation are the clergy. Most of them know something\r\n  of medicine. Almost all of them bleed, and can order a purge,\r\n  which are all the qualifications necessary for the practice of\r\n  inoculation.\r\n\r\nAnd as propagandists--\r\n\r\n  No set of men have it so much in their power to render the\r\n  practice of inoculation general as the clergy, the greatest\r\n  opposition to it still arising from some scruples of conscience,\r\n  which they alone can remove. I would recommend them not only to\r\n  endeavour to remove the religious objections which weak minds\r\n  have to this salutary practice, but to enjoin it as a duty, and\r\n  to point out the danger of neglecting to make use of a means\r\n  which Providence has put in our power for saving the lives of our\r\n  offspring. Surely such parents as wilfully neglect the means of\r\n  saving their children’s lives are as guilty as those who put them\r\n  to death.\r\n\r\nHow familiar have vaccinators rendered this line of adjuration! If\r\nyou do not comply with our prescription, and your children catch\r\nsmallpox, then are you their murderers.\r\n\r\nHere is another passage from Buchan, which with equal accuracy\r\nmight apply to Vaccination--is indeed what is perpetually asserted\r\nto be the truth concerning Vaccination--\r\n\r\n  As the Smallpox is now become an epidemical disease in most\r\n  parts of the known world, no other choice remains but to\r\n  render the malady as mild as possible. This is the only manner\r\n  of extirpation now left in our power; and though it may seem\r\n  paradoxical, the artificial method of communicating the disease,\r\n  could it be rendered universal, would amount to nearly the same\r\n  thing as rooting it out. It is a matter of small consequence\r\n  whether a disease be entirely extirpated, or rendered so mild as\r\n  neither to destroy life nor hurt the constitution; but that this\r\n  may be done by Inoculation, does not now admit of a doubt. The\r\n  numbers who die under Inoculation hardly deserve to be named.\r\n  In the natural way, one in four or five generally dies; but by\r\n  Inoculation not one of a thousand. Nay, some can boast of having\r\n  inoculated ten thousand without the loss of a single patient.\r\n\r\nIn this deliverance, Buchan did not lie, nor did he speak\r\nfor himself alone, but expressed the medical opinion of his\r\ntime, precisely as a physician of to-day testifies concerning\r\nVaccination. Yet we all know that Buchan was completely at fault,\r\nand substituted what he wished to be true for what was true.\r\n\r\nI cannot leave Buchan without a few words in his favour, for,\r\naccording to his lights, he was a worthy fellow, and the words\r\nshall be his own. He wrote--\r\n\r\n  I am old enough to remember the time when the success of\r\n  Inoculation was supposed to be entirely owing to the preparation\r\n  of the body, as it was called; but I am convinced that such\r\n  preparation always has done, and still does, more harm than good.\r\n  _The body cannot be better prepared to meet a disease, than by\r\n  being in good health._ Medicine may cure a disease, but it cannot\r\n  mend good health. When a person enjoys the blessing of health, he\r\n  ought never to meddle with medicine on any account whatever.\r\n\r\nNo: nor with half an inch of thread dipped in pox.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[59] _Sermon preached at Ingatestone, 12th October, 1766, in\r\ndefence of Inoculation, with App. on the present state of\r\nInoculation._ Lond., 1767.\r\n\r\n[60] _Medical Transactions_, vol. ii. art. xix.\r\n\r\n[61] _Tracts on Inoculation_, p. 126.\r\n\r\n[62] _Ibid._ p. 107.\r\n\r\n[63] Monro accounts for the excessive mortality of this year by the\r\npresence of regiments in Edinburgh after the suppression of the\r\nrebellion of 1745.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nINOCULATION ABROAD.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to relate how Inoculation was superseded and\r\nultimately suppressed in England, it may be expedient to make some\r\nnotes on the prevalence of the practice in other lands.\r\n\r\nAnd first in New England where, as we have seen, Cotton Mather had\r\nprecedence in subjecting the reports of eastern inoculation to the\r\ntest of western practice. Mather and his coadjutor, Boylston, did\r\nnot propose to make inoculation habitual, but to reserve it for\r\nuse in epidemics. Sometimes years elapsed in New England without\r\nsmallpox: there were no dense urban populations to constitute\r\nseats of zymotic disease: and to provide perpetually against\r\nwhat was occasional was obviously unnecessary. Nevertheless the\r\ncolonists shared the common disposition of the time for pottering\r\nin remedies, and their slaves afforded convenient opportunities for\r\nexperiments in which temerity had the sanction of beneficence. With\r\nthe Whites, cleanliness, ventilation, drainage, and pure water,\r\nwere conditions of accident rather than of providence, but with the\r\nBlacks life was that of the stye, and the consequences in smallpox\r\nwere thought to be sufficiently accounted for by the assertion\r\nthat Negroes were constitutionally pre-disposed to that disorder.\r\nWherefore the Blacks from Boston to the Spanish Main were from time\r\nto time remorselessly inoculated, and all of them who afterwards\r\nescaped smallpox had their immunity ascribed to their inoculation.\r\n\r\nJonathan Edwards, the prince of Calvinistic divines, was killed by\r\ninoculation. There was an epidemic of smallpox in New Jersey, and,\r\nfor security, Edwards was inoculated. The result was the generation\r\nof smallpox in a severe form, of which he died, 22nd March, 1758,\r\nin his 54th year. In search of a superfluous safety was he slain.\r\nA man of the age of Edwards had little to fear from smallpox; for\r\nthe disease, in the vast majority, was an affection of the young,\r\nconcerning which, as having attained middle life, Edwards might\r\nhave maintained comparative indifference.\r\n\r\nThe colonists usually ascribed any outbreak of smallpox to\r\nimportation by shipping from Europe, if not manifestly, then\r\ncovertly; for, it was held that smallpox could never be evolved\r\nspontaneously. Great pains were therefore taken to isolate\r\npatients, and Boston and other sea-ports had hospitals erected\r\non sites remote from habitation, from which a flag was displayed\r\nwhenever occupied by the sick. A physician who visited an hospital\r\nwas required to take off his wig, to change his shoes, and to put\r\non a gown which hung from his neck to his ankles; and, when he came\r\nout, to wash his hands, and be fumigated with frankincense. In\r\nsetting forth these precautions, Professor Waterhouse of Cambridge,\r\nMassachusetts, observed in a letter to Dr. Haygarth of Chester--\r\n\r\n  I cannot believe them altogether unnecessary. Our towns are\r\n  small, our houses scattered, most of them having a garden between\r\n  them, so that we have been able to trace the action of contagion.\r\n  We have tried many experiments with smallpox in New England, and\r\n  persuade ourselves that we have some pretensions of knowing more\r\n  of that disease than you in Europe.\r\n\r\nDuring the war with England, smallpox broke out in the American\r\narmy, and inoculation was so freely resorted to that scarcely a\r\nman escaped the lancet. Washington had his New England soldiers\r\ninoculated at Cambridge in 1776, and it was difficult to find men\r\nto keep guard over the sick; that is to say, men who had passed\r\nthrough smallpox and were not considered liable to infection,\r\na curious evidence of the rarity of the natural disease in the\r\ncommunities from which the army had been recruited.[64]\r\n\r\nCotton Mather’s triumph over Boston was complete--complete beyond\r\nhis intention; for it came to be as thoroughly inoculated as any\r\ntown in these days is vaccinated. Dr. Waterhouse, writing on 28th\r\nOctober, 1788, said--\r\n\r\n  We find that in 1752 there were but 170 persons liable to\r\n  smallpox in Boston, and in 1754, when there was a general\r\n  inoculation in the town, I question whether there was a quarter\r\n  of that number that did not receive the infection _viâ naturæ vel\r\n  artis_. In the years 1776, ’77, and ’78 they inoculated pretty\r\n  freely throughout the State. Two days ago, I was at the review\r\n  of part of the militia of the county of Suffolk, and of 520 men,\r\n  I scarcely think there were a hundred above twenty-five years of\r\n  age that had not passed through smallpox by means of inoculation;\r\n  and of 2000 reviewed a week or two before, in the county of\r\n  Middlesex, there was not a greater proportion of the same age\r\n  liable to take the disease. Since 1764 the dread of smallpox has\r\n  lessened considerably; and since 1778 we meet the disorder with\r\n  as little fear as any people you can mention.\r\n\r\nIn another letter, dated 15th October, 1787, the Doctor said--\r\n\r\n  I do not believe there is at present a single person infected by\r\n  smallpox in all the four New England Governments, that is, not\r\n  one in a million of people.[65]\r\n\r\nHowever it may have been elsewhere, inoculation was conducted in\r\nBoston with a formality and deliberation that might have satisfied\r\nDimsdale himself. There was an inoculation hospital erected on\r\nSewell’s Point, which juts into Charles River, remote by a mile and\r\na half from the common road, and situated in pleasant grounds with\r\ntrees and walks. Three weeks were devoted to inoculation and the\r\nsubsequent sickness, and before dismissal, wrote Dr. Waterhouse--\r\n\r\n  The patients are washed all over in soap suds, then rubbed with\r\n  brandy, and lastly washed in vinegar; they put on fresh clothes,\r\n  and bury those they wore during their stay in the hospital.\r\n  But even then they are smoked and fumigated with sulphur in\r\n  the smoke-house, which is about twice the size of a common\r\n  sentry-box. This smoke-house has a hole in its side for the\r\n  patient to put his head out of during the operation. Although\r\n  this seems formidable on paper, yet patients submit cheerfully,\r\n  and with no slight merriment.\r\n\r\n  There are perhaps 150 under inoculation at present at Sewell’s\r\n  Point, not one of them paupers. They are principally children,\r\n  perhaps thirty or forty of them of the first people in the\r\n  commonwealth. The charge for the whole process is 8 dollars,\r\n  or 36s. sterling, including every expense from incision to\r\n  dismission. In some places they inoculate for half that sum. You\r\n  must conceive the whole business conducted with a good deal of\r\n  gaiety, where a patient, when ill, is as apt to be pitied as if\r\n  sea-sick with a sailing party. The established system of mirth\r\n  and good humour contributes not a little to the welfare of the\r\n  patients.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious story, and stands in broad contrast to the rough\r\nand ready practice of Turkey, and of many inoculators in England\r\nand elsewhere. Dr. Waterhouse adds--\r\n\r\n  There were a considerable number of persons in Boston to whom\r\n  smallpox could not be communicated by inoculation. In some the\r\n  operation was repeated two, three, and four times with fresh\r\n  matter. Several of these have had the disease severely since in\r\n  the natural way, and some have died of it.\r\n\r\nFrance was slow to accept inoculation. After its introduction in\r\n1723, about thirty years elapsed without any serious movement\r\nin its favour, when Voltaire, Diderot, and their set began to\r\nrecommend the practice, which had the merit of being English and\r\ndisliked by those who held change and improvement in aversion. La\r\nCondamine read an eloquent paper on the advantages of inoculation\r\nbefore the Academy of Sciences; and Turgot, the ardent and\r\nsagacious lover of his kind, procured the inoculation of a child\r\nin Paris, 1st April, 1755; which was followed on 14th May by a\r\nyoung man, named Chastellux, submitting himself to the operation\r\nin the interest of the common welfare. Then Dr. Hosty was sent to\r\nLondon to investigate and report, and on his return issued these\r\nstatements--\r\n\r\n  1. That out of 463 cases inoculated in the London Hospital, only\r\n  one had been unsuccessful; whereas in the Smallpox Hospital\r\n  nearly one in four had died.\r\n\r\n  2. That Mr. Ranby, principal surgeon to his majesty, had\r\n  inoculated 1600 persons, and Mr. Bell 903, without the loss of\r\n  one.\r\n\r\n  3. That to form a just comparison between the fatality of\r\n  natural and artificial smallpox, it is only necessary to visit\r\n  the London Smallpox Hospital and then the Inoculation Hospital:\r\n  the difference between the two is so remarkable that the most\r\n  incredulous must be convinced.\r\n\r\n  4. Lastly, with respect to the asserted insemination of other\r\n  diseases with inoculated smallpox: no instance of the kind has\r\n  ever been produced. Persons have been inoculated with variolous\r\n  matter taken from patients afflicted with venereal disease, yet\r\n  they have received no infection save that of smallpox only.\r\n\r\nIt would be superfluous to deal with the fallacies involved in\r\nthese statements: they served to satisfy those who were disposed\r\nto be satisfied, and inoculation became the fashion among the\r\nscientific and enlightened. Dr. Tronchin, a well-known inoculator,\r\nwas summoned from Geneva to Paris in 1756 to operate upon the\r\nchildren of the Duke of Orleans, and his success was pronounced\r\ndecisive. Nevertheless inoculation did not extend beyond people\r\nof leisure and culture, and in 1763 an outbreak of smallpox in\r\nParis made an end of the practice. An inquiry was instituted by\r\nthe authorities, and the evidence left no doubt that the epidemic\r\nhad been diffused, if it did not originate, with the artificially\r\npoxed; and inoculation was thenceforth prohibited in Paris. Any\r\ncitizen who was resolved to have the induced disease had to retire\r\nto country quarters.\r\n\r\nHere we may observe that the confidence of the inoculator was\r\ngrounded on the assumption that whoever had once passed through\r\nsmallpox, whether natural or artificial, could never again\r\ncontract the disease. Nevertheless the inoculated did contract the\r\ndisease, and the disaster was uniformly accounted for as due to\r\nsome imperfection in the inoculation. There were also instances\r\nof smallpox after smallpox, but these, too, were discredited;\r\nthe first smallpox could not have been smallpox, but chickenpox,\r\nmeasles, or some other eruptive disorder. There was a conspicuous\r\nconfutation of these evasions in the case of Louis XV. He had\r\nsmallpox unquestionably in his 14th year, and of unquestionable\r\nsmallpox he died in 1774 in his 64th year. Notwithstanding, the\r\nassertion was perpetuated that there was no possibility of smallpox\r\nafter smallpox, and it was only when it became necessary to\r\nmaintain the credit of vaccination that the facts were admitted;\r\nand in this form--Smallpox after vaccination is no more common or\r\nextraordinary than smallpox after smallpox--a falsehood on the back\r\nof a former falsehood.\r\n\r\nWe have seen under what safeguards inoculation was practised in\r\nBoston, and now we shall turn to Geneva and discover how all the\r\nAmerican precautions were set at naught in that city with apparent\r\nimpunity. The details are from a letter of the Council of Geneva,\r\ndated 24th December, 1791, addressed to Dr. Haygarth in answer to\r\nhis inquiries and suggestions. Des Gouttes, secretary to the Geneva\r\nSyndic, wrote--\r\n\r\n  I.--The Republic of Geneva contains about 35,000 inhabitants, of\r\n  whom 26,000 dwell in the city, and 9,000 in the adjacent country.\r\n\r\n  II.--The city is of small extent, and ill adapted to so large\r\n  a population; and its extension is not easy on account of the\r\n  fortifications wherewith it is surrounded. There are little more\r\n  than 1200 houses in the city, which are built in many storeys of\r\n  many apartments like the ancient part of Edinburgh, each house\r\n  sheltering on an average twenty-one inhabitants.\r\n\r\n  III.--A great part of the population consists of strangers, not\r\n  only because most of our servants and labourers are natives of\r\n  other countries, but because Geneva being a frontier city, girt\r\n  about by Savoy, Switzerland, and France, and situated on the\r\n  highways of intercourse between these states, travellers are\r\n  always coming and going.\r\n\r\n  IV.--Notwithstanding this continual resort of strangers within\r\n  our walls, an epidemic of smallpox is of almost regular\r\n  occurrence every five years; and between the epidemics it\r\n  frequently happens that we have no natural smallpox whatever,\r\n  either in the city or its vicinity.\r\n\r\n  V.--Inoculation began to be practised here in 1751, since which\r\n  date we have inoculated a very large number of children annually,\r\n  and with such marked success that the deaths have but slightly\r\n  exceeded 1 in 300. Although we have often had to inoculate with\r\n  pus brought from a distance at times when there was no smallpox\r\n  to be found in the city, and although children so inoculated have\r\n  gone freely into the streets, walks, and other public places,\r\n  before, during, and after the eruption, we have never observed\r\n  that they were sources of contagion, nor that they produced any\r\n  intermediate epidemic, nor that they accelerated the return of\r\n  the periodical epidemic.\r\n\r\n  VI.--Lastly, our citizens enjoy a republican constitution which\r\n  requires us to pay most scrupulous regard to the liberty of every\r\n  individual. No coercive measures to hinder the introduction or\r\n  communication of smallpox are here practicable; and we believe we\r\n  ought to limit our action to advice, and to simple precautions of\r\n  police, which must not, nor even seem to be, oppressive to the\r\n  citizens.\r\n\r\nThis glimpse into old Geneva is not only instructive as concerns\r\ninoculation, but it is another exposure of the monstrous fable\r\nthat represents European cities as decimated with smallpox until\r\nJenner’s advent as saviour--a fable that vanishes like smoke\r\nwhenever brought into contact with matter-of-fact.\r\n\r\nInoculation was introduced to Rome and Florence during a severe\r\nepidemic in 1754; and attention being drawn to the remedy, it was\r\ndiscovered that the Italian peasantry had long practised voluntary\r\nsmallpox just as did the peasantry of Wales and the Highlands of\r\nScotland. In Spain, inoculation made little headway: in the words\r\nof Moore--\r\n\r\n  Some inoculations were effected in a few trading cities, which\r\n  held communication with England; but these efforts were of short\r\n  duration, and from the distinguished inaction of the Spaniards,\r\n  inoculation was soon relinquished; and no other country in Europe\r\n  has suffered so little from smallpox.[66]\r\n\r\nIn Holland and Denmark inoculation acquired a certain vogue among\r\nthe upper classes, and in Germany the like was true to a less\r\nextent. In Sweden inoculation was encouraged by the Court, and\r\nDr. Schultz was deputed to visit the London Hospital. His report\r\nwas so favourable that in 1755 inoculation houses were opened in\r\nseveral parts of the kingdom, and the benefits of the practice were\r\ncommemorated by a medal in 1757--a curious trophy of illusion under\r\nprepossession.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most notable event in the story of inoculation was\r\nits introduction into Russia: how it was brought about is thus\r\ndescribed by Mr. Morley--\r\n\r\n  As soon as Catharine came into power (1762), she at once applied\r\n  herself to make friends in this powerful region [French letters\r\n  and philosophy]. It was a matter of course that she should begin\r\n  with the omnipotent monarch at Ferney. Graceful verses from\r\n  Voltaire were as indispensable an ornament to a crowned head\r\n  as a diadem, and Catharine answered with compliments that were\r\n  perhaps more sincere than his verses. She wonders how she can\r\n  repay him for a bundle of books that he had sent to her, and\r\n  at last bethinks herself that nothing will please the lover of\r\n  mankind so much as the introduction of inoculation into the great\r\n  Empire; so she sends for Dr. Dimsdale from England, and submits\r\n  to the unfamiliar rite in her own sacred person.[67]\r\n\r\nOne day in the summer of 1768, at his house in Hertford, Dimsdale\r\nreceived an unexpected message from Pouschin, the Russian minister\r\nin London, to wait upon him; and in his presence he learnt that he\r\nwas required to proceed at once to St. Petersburg to inoculate the\r\nEmpress. There was of course some hesitation about undertaking so\r\nlong a journey, but Pouschin had been authorised to overcome all\r\nobstacles. What would the Doctor require in the way of expenses?\r\nThe Doctor discreetly answered that he would leave that to her\r\nImperial Majesty, whereon Pouschin handed him £1000 to pay his\r\nway to St. Petersburg. Dimsdale summoned his son from his medical\r\nstudies in Edinburgh, and the two set off for the North on the 28th\r\nof July.\r\n\r\nAt St. Petersburg Dimsdale was received with every mark of respect\r\nand liberal hospitality. He was introduced to the Empress, who\r\nwas charming and gracious; and he was instructed to make the\r\nrequisite preparations for the serious duty before him. He had\r\nto find pus, and to obtain pus he had to lay hands on a suitable\r\nsufferer from smallpox--a task which proved by no means easy.\r\nHaving discovered a case to his mind, he had then to overcome an\r\nobstinate objection to the abstraction of virus. He had, at the\r\nsame time, to find a couple of healthy young men, who had not had\r\nsmallpox, on whom to raise secondary virus, for the Empress could\r\nnot be expected to run the risk of smallpox without mitigation.\r\nHis first attempt was a complete failure, and he had to report\r\naccordingly to his expectant patient. Catharine heard his report\r\nwith philosophical equanimity, and left him to try again. At last\r\nhe was successful, and at the palace of Czarscoe Selo on Saturday,\r\n11th October, 1768, the Empress swallowed five grains of mercurial\r\npowder, and late on Sunday evening Dimsdale inoculated her with\r\nfluid matter by one puncture in each arm. She did well. From the\r\ntime of the inoculation to the commencement of the eruption, she\r\nwalked every day for two or three hours in the open air, and, on\r\nthe 1st November, she returned to St. Petersburg “in perfect good\r\nhealth, to the great joy of the whole city.”[68] The Grand Duke\r\nwas inoculated on the 30th October, and by the 22nd November had\r\n“perfectly recovered.”\r\n\r\nThe Empress having played, the nobility had to follow suit, and\r\nDimsdale was requested to proceed to Moscow to take them in hand;\r\nbut at this time there was a new difficulty. There was said to be\r\nno smallpox in Moscow, and as Dimsdale could not inoculate without\r\nfresh virus, he had to inoculate two girls in St. Petersburg,\r\ndesigning so to time their disorder that he should arrive with\r\nthem in Moscow in prime condition for business. One girl was a\r\nfailure, and mishaps and delays on the sledge journey almost made a\r\nfailure of the other. He did, however, reach Moscow in time enough\r\nto communicate the requisite infection to fifty patients, and in\r\nMoscow he remained for two months operating and playing the lion.\r\nThen he set off for home, and on his route through St. Petersburg\r\nfound Catharine suffering from pleurisy, for which he bled her,\r\ndrawing eight ounces of imperial blood. Then came the reckoning. In\r\nsubstantials he had--\r\n\r\n    £10,000 down;\r\n    £2,000 for travelling expenses;\r\n    £500 a year for life, to be paid in net English cash, and\r\n    A superb gold snuff-box set with diamonds for Mr. Dimsdale.\r\n\r\nIn honours he had the appointments of--\r\n\r\n    Counsellor of State;\r\n    Physician to her Imperial Majesty; and\r\n    Baron of the Russian Empire with descent of title to his\r\n      eldest son.\r\n\r\nIt was a barbarian’s style of recompense, paid under the eye of\r\nEurope. It cost Catharine nothing, for it is subjects who suffer\r\nfor the extravagance of despots.\r\n\r\nDimsdale had plans for the systematic inoculation of Russia, but\r\nthey resulted in little. Catharine’s purpose was sufficiently\r\nserved in the display she had made; and possibly she came to\r\nconsider Dimsdale an appendage of that deceiver Voltaire, whose\r\nbusts, that had adorned her saloons and corridors, were by her\r\norders thrown into the cellars when the French revolution opened\r\nher eyes to the consequences of French philosophy.\r\n\r\nIn perusing the literature of inoculation, nothing impresses a\r\nreader, enlightened by sanitary science, so much as the manner in\r\nwhich smallpox was regarded as something like hail or lightning\r\nthat might be averted, but could not be prevented. So far, I have\r\nnot met with even a hint in that literature that smallpox was\r\neither induced by unwholesome modes of life, or that it could be\r\navoided by wholesome modes. In conjunction with this blindness\r\nwas the amazing assumption of the inoculators, that every one\r\ninoculated was to be placed to their credit as saved from smallpox;\r\nas if (granting inoculation to be prophylactic) smallpox was ever a\r\nuniversal epidemic, and as if multitudes did not pass through life\r\nwithout smallpox before inoculation was heard of. The true problem\r\nto be set and solved in all epidemics, whether of influenza or\r\nsmallpox, is why some are susceptible and some insusceptible, and\r\nwhether it is not practicable so to modify conditions as to carry\r\nover the susceptible to the ranks of the insusceptible.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[64] Humphries’s _Life of General Putnam_, p. 151.\r\n\r\n[65] These letters of Benjamin Waterhouse, M.D., Professor\r\nof Physic at Cambridge, Mass., appear in Haygarth’s _Plan to\r\nExterminate Smallpox_.

Suppose an inquirer wished\r\nto ascertain the ratio of deaths to inoculations, he would be\r\ncompletely bewildered. We have seen what Dr. Buchan wrote--\r\n\r\n  In the natural way, one in four or five generally dies of\r\n  smallpox; but by inoculation not one of a thousand. Nay, some\r\n  can boast of having inoculated ten thousand without the loss of\r\n  a single patient.\r\n\r\nJohn Birch, an eminent London surgeon, said--\r\n\r\n  Not one in three hundred dies of inoculation in the general\r\n  irregular mode of proceeding, and not one in a thousand among\r\n  observant practitioners; and if the inoculated patient die, he\r\n  dies of smallpox and of nothing but smallpox.[69]\r\n\r\nIn the _Edinburgh Review_, October, 1806, we read--\r\n\r\n  Of those who have smallpox naturally, one is found to die in\r\n  six. Of inoculated patients, only one dies in two hundred and\r\n  fifty. This at least is Dr. Willan’s calculation; and we are\r\n  persuaded that it is very near the truth. In London, where it\r\n  ought to be best ascertained, some eminent practitioners have\r\n  stated the proportion to be so high as one in the hundred. The\r\n  zealous anti-vaccinists have denied it to be greater, under\r\n  judicious treatment, than one in a thousand. It cannot be denied,\r\n  however, that besides the risk to life, the disease, even under\r\n  the mitigated form, has frequently proved an exciting cause\r\n  of scrofula and other dreadful distempers, and has often been\r\n  attended with blindness and deformity.\r\n\r\nIn Reynolds’s _System of Medicine_, it is stated by Marson that--\r\n\r\n  The Smallpox and Inoculation Hospital was founded in London in\r\n  1746, and inoculation was continued there until 1822. Dr. Gregory\r\n  went carefully over the records of the Hospital for that period\r\n  of seventy-six years, and found that only three in a thousand\r\n  died of inoculation. The inoculated disease was usually very\r\n  mild, but not invariably so.\r\n\r\nScores of such testimonies might be adduced, twitching the\r\nreader from conclusion to conclusion; and in the conflict of\r\nauthorities what is to be said? It is true that if we select\r\nwhat evidence we like, and call it sound, and reject what we\r\ndislike, and call it unsound, we may prove anything; but it is\r\nalso true, that if we are to be fettered by evidence we shall\r\nstand paralysed amid contradictions. When men who are competent,\r\nand obviously honest, deliver varying testimony, we are driven\r\nto seek some method of reconciliation; and in this matter of\r\nInoculation wherein our resort is to books, and about which we\r\ncan have no immediate experience, we may derive much light from\r\nthe corresponding practice of Vaccination. Thus, what is commoner\r\nthan for vaccinators to assert, that never within their sphere of\r\nobservation have they witnessed a single case of injury resulting\r\nfrom Vaccination--not one! Subject any dozen ordinary practitioners\r\nto judicial examination, and they would thus testify with scarcely\r\na note of variation. On the other hand, take any dozen mothers of\r\nfamilies, especially from among the poor, and they would tell of\r\nillness, disease, and death following the vaccinators’ lancets. The\r\nmen are more or less competent and honest, and the women likewise,\r\nand how shall we account for their variance? In the first place,\r\nthe men have been drilled from the outset of their profession into\r\nthe conviction that Vaccination is absolutely harmless, and if any\r\ndisaster follows, it is coincidence, not consequence. Occasionally\r\na practitioner of more vigorous intelligence than the average, like\r\nMr. Henry May of Birmingham, sees what the mothers see, but does he\r\nreport accordingly? Not at all. In Mr. May’s own words--\r\n\r\n  A death from Vaccination occurred not long ago in my practice,\r\n  and although I had not vaccinated the child, yet in my desire to\r\n  preserve Vaccination from reproach, I omitted all mention of it\r\n  from my certificate of death.[70]\r\n\r\nMr. May recognised the fact and concealed it: a duller man would\r\nhave ascribed the death mechanically to erysipelas or pyœmia.\r\nIndeed, it is a commonplace with medical men, that no child dies\r\nof Vaccination; and hence Vaccination is not an admitted cause of\r\ndeath; and when the fact is insisted upon, there is no limit to\r\nthe hardihood wherewith the truth is crushed down and covered up.\r\nCoroners refuse to hold inquests on children slain by Vaccination,\r\nand Dr. Lankester, as coroner for Middlesex, did not hesitate to\r\nauthorise a false certificate of death in order, like Mr. May,\r\n“to preserve Vaccination from reproach.”[71] As for mothers, poor\r\ncreatures, few of them have minds of their own, and if only they\r\nwere adequately assured that it was for the good of their offspring\r\nthat their noses should be slit, they would believe, weep, and\r\nsubmit.\r\n\r\nBut it will be pointed out that inoculators of the more reasonable\r\nsort admitted a certain mortality from the practice. It is so; but\r\nthe admission was unavoidable. Inoculation communicated smallpox,\r\nand there was no evasion of the fact that occasionally the malady\r\nassumed a severe form, and the patient died. For such mishaps,\r\nhowever, there were always excuses. The patient was not in a\r\nsuitable condition of body; he had been eating improperly; he had\r\ncaught cold; and so on. There remained, nevertheless, the sequelæ\r\nof Inoculation, which were just as persistently denied as are those\r\nof Vaccination, although there were always clear-sighted observers\r\nwho maintained that it was impossible to infect the blood with a\r\ncomplex organic virus, and that it should exhaust its effects in\r\na single and definite issue. We all remember how we used to be\r\nassured with contemptuous emphasis that it was utterly impossible\r\nto communicate Syphilis by Vaccination, and that assertions to\r\nthe contrary were the fables of ignorance and malice; yet, we\r\nsee that what was fabulous a few years ago, is now accepted as\r\nmedical matter-of-fact. Nowhere is scepticism so useful as among\r\nphysicians; for whenever they protest most, suspect most.\r\n\r\nWith the close of the 18th Century, Inoculation with smallpox to\r\navert smallpox was accepted as sound practice throughout England.\r\nIts safety and efficiency were extolled by medical writers in\r\nterms curiously identical with those applied to Vaccination.\r\nThe objectors were few, and for pious rather than physiological\r\nreasons; and the question that exercised practical and benevolent\r\nminds was how to universalise the remedy, which, on account of its\r\ntroublesome accompaniments, was chiefly confined to the upper and\r\nmiddle classes. On this point it may be well to cite the words of\r\nDr. Haygarth of Chester, who, in a letter to the Council of Health\r\nof Geneva, dated 10th February, 1792, thus sets forth the position\r\nof affairs--\r\n\r\n  In Chester, and, I believe, in most of the large towns of\r\n  England, the casual smallpox is almost constantly present. _All\r\n  the children of the middle and higher ranks of our citizens\r\n  are inoculated in early infancy._ The populace, very generally\r\n  regarding the distemper as inevitable, neither fear nor shun\r\n  it; but much more frequently by voluntary and intentional\r\n  intercourse, endeavour to catch the casual infection. All the\r\n  difficulties of our Smallpox Society in Chester proceeded from\r\n  this strange delusion and perversity of disposition. With us\r\n  the smallpox is seldom or never heard of except in the Bills of\r\n  Mortality; but there its devastation appears dreadful indeed.\r\n\r\nThe strong objection to Inoculation was, that it diffused the\r\ndisease generally which it was supposed to avert individually.\r\nInoculators tried to minimise and deny the danger, but in vain;\r\nand nothing so contributed to the supersession of the practice by\r\nVaccination as the expectation of escape from the artificially\r\npropagated disease. How extensive was that propagation, we leave\r\nthe writer in the _Edinburgh Review_ of 1806 to describe--\r\n\r\n  The inoculated smallpox is an infectious disease, and those who\r\n  take it naturally from an inoculated patient have it as violently\r\n  as if they had been infected from a case of spontaneous disease;\r\n  it is to all intents and purposes the natural smallpox again in\r\n  them. Now, if it be considered that several hundred thousand\r\n  persons have been annually inoculated in these Kingdoms for the\r\n  last fifty years, it will be easy to calculate the immense\r\n  addition that must have been made in that period to the cases of\r\n  actual disease, and the increase of natural smallpox that may be\r\n  supposed to have arisen from this constant multiplication of the\r\n  sources and centres of infection.\r\n\r\nUnless this culture and this traffic in smallpox throughout the\r\nUnited Kingdom be realised, the potent cause of the immediate and\r\nextravagant success of Vaccination will be left out of reckoning.\r\nWhen we are harassed, anxious and impatient under some course of\r\nconduct, our ears are open to any promise of relief; and it was\r\nto a generation so afflicted and so receptive that Jenner in 1798\r\nmade his revelation of the virtue of cowpox. No more need, said\r\nhe, to inoculate with smallpox. Substitute cowpox; and whilst it\r\nwill protect as effectually, it will inflict no injury and diffuse\r\nno infection. The revelation was received with acclamation, and\r\nwithin eighteen months of its delivery (without due experience, and\r\nwithout any warrant that could pass muster in the severe realm of\r\nscience) the leading physicians and surgeons of London subscribed\r\nand published the following manifesto in the newspapers of 1800--\r\n\r\n  We, the undersigned physicians and surgeons, think it our duty to\r\n  declare our opinion, that those persons who have had the Cowpox\r\n  are perfectly secure from the infection of the Smallpox, provided\r\n  this infection has not been previously communicated.\r\n\r\nI do not wish to anticipate the wondrous tale of Jenner--my\r\npresent purpose is to show how Inoculation was set aside; and it\r\nsuffices to state that cowpox rapidly made an end of inoculation\r\nwith smallpox. Indeed, I question whether a revolution in practice\r\nwas ever effected with similar facility. Within eight years of\r\nthe delivery of Jenner’s revelation, the writer in the _Edinburgh\r\nReview_ of 1806, already cited, was able to testify--\r\n\r\n  The bitterest enemies of Vaccination will not deny, that\r\n  more than nine-tenths of the medical world are decidedly and\r\n  zealously in favour of it, and that all their demonstrations\r\n  of its dangers and terrors have been insufficient to convert a\r\n  single one of their brethren from so damnable and dangerous a\r\n  heresy. Testimonies, it may be said, should be weighed, and not\r\n  numbered; and in this respect the vaccinators, we are afraid,\r\n  will have a splendid and indisputable triumph. We give the\r\n  anti-vaccinists all the advantage in our power when we assign\r\n  to them a few members of the profession in London; for in the\r\n  country at large, we believe, they have not one respectable\r\n  practitioner on their side in five hundred. In this great city\r\n  and school of medicine [Edinburgh] we are assured, they are\r\n  without a single public adherent.\r\n\r\nThe resistance to Vaccination was almost entirely confined to\r\nthe resistance of inoculators, who were too deeply compromised\r\nby their own disloyalty to Nature, to make effective resistance.\r\nThey were steadily borne down by the vaccinators, many of whom\r\nhad been energetic inoculators, and displayed the usual ardour of\r\napostates in condemning what they had formerly approved. Indeed,\r\nwhen we consider how Inoculation was commended for its efficiency\r\nand harmlessness by the same medical authorities who, within a year\r\nor two after Jenner’s appearance, denounced the practice for its\r\ndifficulties and dangers, their tergiversation appears little short\r\nof shameless. Dr. Lettsom had been an inoculator, yet on 2nd July,\r\n1805, he felt warranted in writing--\r\n\r\n  What have not the abettors of Variolous Inoculation to answer\r\n  for? To shoot a dozen or two innocent people in the public\r\n  streets of London would not be half so injurious as allowing\r\n  the murderers to kill the rising generation, the future hope of\r\n  the State. Nothing can show the supineness and ignorance of the\r\n  Government more than legalising these Variolous Murders.\r\n\r\nHow far the conquest of the inoculators by the vaccinators had\r\nadvanced, appeared in a debate in the House of Commons in 1806,\r\nwhen Wilberforce urged that Inoculation should be suppressed, or at\r\nleast that those who insisted on Inoculation should be compelled\r\nto place their patients in quarantine. Mr. Windham admitted the\r\nscandal of wretched and miserable subjects of Inoculation being\r\ncarried about in the streets, but he hesitated to recommend\r\ncoercive legislation until persuasion had been fully tried and\r\nhad failed. Dr. Matthews, M.P. for Hereford, took occasion at the\r\nsame time to run with the hounds. Inoculation, he said, was a\r\nfrequent cause of disfigurement and of death in its most awful\r\nform; it was a magazine of the most dreadful evils; a magnifier of\r\nmortality; and a means of introducing scrofula, a more dangerous\r\nand pernicious disorder than smallpox itself--facts which it would\r\nhave been more creditable to have proclaimed when Inoculation was\r\nin fashion. It is so easy to kick when a foe has fallen, and where\r\nall are kicking. Human nature is never so despicable as when thus\r\nengaged.\r\n\r\nThe question of restraining Inoculation came again before the House\r\nof Commons in 1807, when the practice of inoculating out-patients\r\nat the London dispensaries and hospitals was energetically\r\ncondemned. “I think that the legislature,” said Mr. Sturges Bourne,\r\n“would be as much justified in taking a measure to prevent this\r\nevil by restraint, as a man would be in snatching a fire-brand out\r\nof the hands of a maniac just as he was going to set fire to a\r\ncity.”\r\n\r\nNo one was more eager to suppress Inoculation by force than Jenner\r\nhimself, and in July 1807, he sought an interview with the Premier\r\nfor the purpose. In a letter to Dr. Lettsom he thus describes his\r\nmortification--\r\n\r\n  You will be sorry to hear the result of my interview with the\r\n  Minister, Mr. Perceval. I solicited this honour with the sole\r\n  view of inquiring whether it was the intention of Government\r\n  to give a check to the licentious manner in which Smallpox\r\n  Inoculation is at this time conducted in the metropolis. I\r\n  instanced the mortality it occasioned in language as forcible\r\n  as I could utter, and showed him clearly that it was the great\r\n  source from which the pest of smallpox was disseminated through\r\n  the country as well as through the town. But, alas! all I said\r\n  availed nothing, and the speckled monster is still to have the\r\n  liberty that the Smallpox Hospital, the delusions of Moseley, and\r\n  the caprices and prejudices of the misguided poor, can possibly\r\n  give him. I cannot express to you the chagrin and disappointment\r\n  I felt at this interview.\r\n\r\nWe are not accustomed to regard politicians of Perceval’s order as\r\nfavourable to liberty; and yet it is refreshing to remark in even\r\nthe Tories of the Georgian age a jealous regard for the personal\r\nfreedom of Englishmen, and a hearty contempt for the plausible\r\nquacks who were always contriving to circumscribe it. Perceval was\r\nnot opposed to Vaccination, but he would not consent to give it an\r\nillicit advantage over Inoculation. If it were the good thing it\r\nwas asserted to be, it might be left to prevail by reason of its\r\nown quality.\r\n\r\nUnder medical and social pressure, the practice of Inoculation at\r\npublic institutions was gradually abandoned. On 5th May, 1808, the\r\ninoculation of out-patients was discontinued at the London Smallpox\r\nHospital, but not until 20th of June, 1822, did the inoculation of\r\nin-patients cease. In 1816 the Colleges of Surgeons of London and\r\nDublin pledged themselves against the practice. A formal attempt\r\nat coercive legislation, often called for, was at last made by\r\nthe directors of the National Vaccine Establishment. They framed\r\nand promoted a bill, which was introduced to the House of Lords\r\nin 1813 by Lord Boringdon, but it was ignominiously withdrawn in\r\n1814--a choice example of grand-motherly legislation. Among its\r\nprovisions was the enactment that whenever an inoculation took\r\nplace, the clergyman of the parish should receive notice, and that\r\nred flags should be displayed from the house where the patient lay!\r\nAs Earl Stanhope observed, instead of being a measure of humanity,\r\nit would, if passed into law, be one of the most troublesome,\r\ninconvenient, and mischievous ever enacted.\r\n\r\nIn the discussion on this foolish project, Lord Eldon pointed out\r\nthat the common law was already sufficient to arrest the exposure\r\nof sufferers from infectious disease; and acting on the hint the\r\nVaccine Establishment prosecuted a woman, 27th April, 1815, for\r\ncarrying her inoculated child covered with pustules through the\r\nstreets of her neighbourhood. Evidence was adduced that she had\r\nthus infected eleven persons with smallpox of whom eight had died.\r\nThe Court of King’s Bench pronounced her conduct illegal and\r\ncriminal, but as it was the first prosecution for such an offence,\r\nshe was let off with a sentence of three months’ imprisonment.\r\n\r\nA practice thus banned could not long survive in England, and\r\nby and by a medical man who would consent to inoculate became\r\na rarity, or was accounted disreputable. Yet there remained\r\nold-fashioned folk who would have nothing to do with cowpox,\r\nand insisted on having genuine human pox for their children and\r\ngrandchildren. Hence Dr. Epps writing in 1831 had to say--\r\n\r\n  There is a class of medical practitioners who inoculate for the\r\n  smallpox. Society should utter its voice of moral indignation\r\n  against such individuals, who glory in anything by which they can\r\n  claim singularity, or by which they can increase their pecuniary\r\n  means. Let not society be deceived into any parley with such\r\n  practices upon the plea, that parents _will_ have their children\r\n  inoculated with the smallpox.[72]\r\n\r\nGradually the inoculating practitioner ceased, and the practice\r\nremained in the hands of “ignorant and unqualified persons, old\r\nwomen, and itinerant quacks;”[73] and then the end came. An Act of\r\nParliament was passed in 1840 wherein it was enacted that--\r\n\r\n  Any person who shall produce or attempt to produce in any person\r\n  by inoculation with variolous matter, or by wilful exposure to\r\n  variolous matter, or to any matter, article, or thing impregnated\r\n  with variolous matter, or wilfully by any other means whatsoever\r\n  produce the disease of smallpox in any person in England,\r\n  Wales, or Ireland, shall be liable to be proceeded against and\r\n  convicted summarily before any two or more justices of the peace\r\n  in petty sessions assembled, and for every such offence shall,\r\n  upon conviction, be imprisoned in the common gaol or house of\r\n  correction for any term not exceeding one month.\r\n\r\nThe Government did not at first intend to make the prohibition\r\nabsolute, but Mr. Wakley insisted that the time had arrived to\r\nsuppress the nuisance summarily, and that not a voice would be\r\nraised in opposition. Nor was there any opposition. Mr. Goulburn\r\nexpressed some hesitation, but the House was practically unanimous.\r\n\r\nOutside the House few regrets were expressed. Dr. George Gregory,\r\nphysician of the Smallpox Hospital at St. Pancras, was, however, a\r\nman of philosophic turn, and he did not see the old idol cast down\r\nunmoved.\r\n\r\n  On 23rd July, 1840 [he wrote], the practice of inoculation, the\r\n  introduction of which has conferred immortality on the name of\r\n  Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, which had been sanctioned by the\r\n  College of Physicians, which had saved the lives of many kings,\r\n  queens, and princes, and of thousands of their subjects, during\r\n  the greater part of the preceding century, was declared illegal\r\n  by the English Parliament, and all offenders were to be sent\r\n  to prison, with a good chance of the tread-mill. Such are the\r\n  reverses of fortune to which all sublunary things are doomed.[74]\r\n\r\nGregory was not blind to the extravagant claims made for\r\nVaccination, and evidently had a lurking conviction that all was\r\nnot gain in the substitution of the new practice for the old,\r\nsaying--\r\n\r\n  Had not the discovery of Jenner interfered to interrupt its\r\n  extension and improvement, Inoculation would have continued to\r\n  this day increasing yearly in popularity.[75]\r\n\r\nYet was not Inoculation abolished. Sometimes when we get the devil\r\nout at the door, he presently re-enters by the window; and thus\r\nwhile Parliament was making an end of Inoculation in one form, it\r\nwas reviving in another.\r\n\r\nIt is to be understood that Jenner’s cowpox, whatever it might\r\nbe, was an uncommon and erratic disease, and its discovery and\r\nmaintenance difficult. To provide a substitute, cows were from time\r\nto time inoculated with smallpox, and the resulting virus was used\r\ninstead of the Jennerian specific. Lest one should be accused of\r\nquestionable witness, let us refer to Dr. Seaton’s _Handbook of\r\nVaccination_. There we read--\r\n\r\n  Mr. Ceely of Aylesbury in February, 1839, succeeded in inducing\r\n  vaccine vesicles on two sturks by inoculation with variolous\r\n  lymph, and in thus establishing lymph-stocks, which passed at\r\n  once into extensive use, so that, in a few months, more than 2000\r\n  children had been vaccinated from them. In December, 1840, Mr.\r\n  Badcock succeeded in variolating a cow at Brighton, and deriving\r\n  therefrom a stock of genuine vaccine lymph. In this manner he\r\n  has raised stocks of vaccine lymph for use on no fewer than\r\n  thirty-seven separate occasions. The lymph thus obtained by him\r\n  is now largely employed; it has been supplied to many hundreds\r\n  of practitioners, and very many thousands of children have\r\n  been vaccinated with it. Mr. Ceely’s experiments were repeated\r\n  in America in 1852 by Dr. Adams of Waltham, and Dr. Putnam of\r\n  Boston, who were able, it is said, to furnish the city and\r\n  neighbourhood of Boston with all the vaccine matter used there\r\n  since that period.\r\n\r\nAgain, Sir John Cordy Burrows, a surgeon, speaking as a magistrate,\r\nat Brighton on 5th February, 1876, observed--\r\n\r\n  The public seem scarcely to understand what Vaccination means.\r\n  The vaccine lymph taken from a child is nothing more than what\r\n  has passed from a smallpox patient through a cow. In 1856-58 I\r\n  took an active part in inoculating seventeen cows with smallpox,\r\n  producing in three cases vaccine lymph, and from these the world\r\n  has been supplied.\r\n\r\nThus, as asserted, has Inoculation been revived, and Jenner’s\r\nspecific set aside. When Dimsdale had Russian nobles to operate\r\nupon, he tried to mollify the smallpox by passing it through\r\nhealthy children. Cows have now taken the place of children, and\r\nthe virus in its passage from arm to arm may still further be\r\nreduced in virulence, when it does not take up fresh malignities\r\nsuch as syphilis; but it is inoculation with smallpox all the same.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[69] _Serious Reasons for Uniformly Objecting to the Practice of\r\nVaccination._ By John Birch. London, 1806.\r\n\r\n[70] _Birmingham Medical Review_, January, 1874.\r\n\r\n[71] The facts are set forth in _Vaccination Tracts_, No. 14, p.7.\r\n\r\n[72] _Life of John Walker, M.D._ London, 1831, p. 326.\r\n\r\n[73] Letter of Poor Law Commissioners, 20th August, 1840.\r\n\r\n[74] _Lectures on Eruptive Fevers._ London, 1843, p. 39.\r\n\r\n[75] _Ib._, p. 93.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nAS TO THE PREVALENCE OF SMALLPOX IN THE 18TH CENTURY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe exact truth as to the prevalence of smallpox in the 18th\r\nCentury is not attainable; vital statistics were undeveloped; and\r\nin the absence of precision the imaginative revel. M.D.’s and\r\nM.P.’s shut their eyes, tilt their noses skyward, and prophesy\r\nconcerning the frightful ravages, and the salvation wrought by\r\nthe revered and immortal Jenner. Any extravagance, as to the\r\nravages, or as to the salvation, is accepted as laudable zeal for\r\nhumanity. “Decimation” is a favourite word in this connection\r\nwithout any sense of its definite meaning. “What family before\r\n1800 ever escaped decimation from smallpox?” asks Dr. Granville.\r\n“Smallpox decimated the country in olden times,” says Dr. Chavasse;\r\n“it ravaged like a plague, whilst Inoculation caused the disease\r\nto spread like wild-fire;” adding as a sequence, “Vaccination is\r\nan important cause of our increasing population.” In the same\r\ntemper, Lord Chief Justice Cockburn described an unvaccinated\r\ninfant as “a centre of contagion;” and as the folly of the great is\r\nintensified in the little, Mr. Bompas, Q.C., informed the electors\r\nof Marylebone, that “a person not vaccinated is like a flaming\r\nfire-brand among the people.” Thus the infants of last century were\r\n“centres of contagion;” the adults were “flaming fire-brands;”\r\nwhilst England was “decimated” with smallpox diffused like\r\nwild-fire by inoculation. What a picture of 18th Century England\r\npainted by Rant and illuminated by Delirium!\r\n\r\nThe tendency of excess on one side is to provoke to excess on\r\nthe other, but the extravagance of these popular fables ought to\r\nput us in love with homely matter-of-fact--wherein indeed is the\r\ntrue extreme of these frantic inventions. What was the extent of\r\nsmallpox in England last century is the question. With accuracy,\r\nwe do not know. The common estimates (when not evolved from inner\r\nconsciousness) are based on the London Bills of Mortality, and\r\nwhen these Bills are scrutinised we find nothing to justify the\r\nopinion that the community was harassed and devastated by smallpox\r\nover other ailments. In the first place, we have to remark that\r\nthe exact population of the metropolis was unknown. Some say it\r\nwas 500,000 in 1701, and others 700,000. In 1751 it was generally\r\nreckoned at 750,000, and in 1801 it was said to be 958,863. Then\r\nwe have to consider that the increase, whatever it might be, lay\r\nonly partially within the Bills of Mortality, for several rising\r\nquarters were outside the boundaries, and there were extensive\r\nexemptions within. Thus, so late as 1818, we find Dr. Burrows\r\nwriting--\r\n\r\n  The parishes of Marylebone, Pancras, Chelsea, Kensington, and\r\n  Paddington, now forming an integral part of the metropolis, and\r\n  containing a population of 160,000 are not within the Bills of\r\n  Mortality, and make no returns. Neither are there any returns\r\n  from St. Paul’s Cathedral, Westminster Abbey, the Temple Church,\r\n  the Rolls and Lincoln’s Inn Chapels, the Chapter House, the Tower\r\n  Church, and various other places of worship of the Established\r\n  Church. Besides, neither Dissenters, Papists or Jews who have\r\n  burying places of their own, are included in the Bills. Many of\r\n  the wealthier classes when they die are removed for interment\r\n  into the country; nor do they appear in the Bills.\r\n\r\nWith omissions so serious, the Bills are obviously worth little as\r\nregisters of the number of deaths in any year in London; and when\r\nwe inquire how far they may be trusted as indicating the relative\r\nprevalence of certain forms of disease, we find them equally\r\nquestionable. Dr. Burrows thus describes the method by which the\r\ncauses of death were ascertained--\r\n\r\n  Diseases as specified in the Bills are a disgrace to the medical\r\n  science and civilisation in which as a nation we are acknowledged\r\n  pre-eminent; nor can any effective reform take place while the\r\n  sources of information are so ignorant and venal as at present.\r\n  The information as to the disease of which any person dies is\r\n  collected and verified in the following way.--The Churchwardens\r\n  of each parish within the Bills of Mortality appoint two old\r\n  women to the office of Searchers. These women as soon as they\r\n  hear the knell for the dead, repair to the sexton of the parish\r\n  to learn the residence of the deceased. They demand admittance\r\n  into the house to examine the body in order that they may see\r\n  that there is nothing suspicious about it, and _judge_ of what\r\n  disease the person died; and _they_ report to the parish clerk.\r\n  The regular charge for the performance of this office is 4d.\r\n  to each Searcher; but if an extra gratuity be tendered, they\r\n  seldom pass the threshold or hall of the house, and are content\r\n  with whatever account is given; or should they actually view the\r\n  corpse, it is easy to imagine what credit is due to the judgment\r\n  they pronounce.[76]\r\n\r\nIn presence of defects so grave as to the number of the dead, and\r\nof diagnosis so grotesque as to the causes of death, it would\r\nbe unwise to argue with any confidence from the data of these\r\nBills; yet, such as they are, we have nothing else to appeal\r\nto. The variations of mortality from year to year were of wide\r\nirregularity; and whatever influence smallpox might have had, it\r\ndoes not appear to have had much in magnifying the annual totals.\r\nLet us take a dozen years when smallpox was heaviest from the last\r\nseventy years of the century, and observe its relation to the\r\nentire mortality, and to that from fevers--\r\n\r\n            Burials from     From       From\r\n    Year.   all Diseases.

Again, we have to remark,\r\nthat, on an average of all the years, smallpox was accountable\r\nfor something less than a tenth of the total mortality. Also we\r\nhave to note, that the mortality from smallpox was in great part\r\ninfant mortality, and that there is reason to believe measles was\r\nextensively confounded with smallpox. The infant mortality was\r\nprodigious. Rarely a year passed in which a fourth of the deaths\r\nwas not set down to Convulsions--that is, to babes killed by\r\nimproper feeding. In 1772 (the worst smallpox year of the century\r\nwhen 3,992 died) there were, 6,605 ascribed to Convulsions, the\r\ntotal mortality being 26,053.\r\n\r\nNow I have no wish to minimise the London smallpox of last century,\r\nnor even to set 1797, when 522 died, against 1796, when 3548 died.\r\nI yield to none in detestation of smallpox as a preventible and\r\ntherefore disgraceful affliction. Let so much pass for granted;\r\nbut do not let us in any access of sanitary fury lose alike eyes\r\nand reason and rave like maniacs. If smallpox was bad, fevers were\r\nworse, and as both had a common origin, why should we make a wanton\r\nand unscientific distinction between them?\r\n\r\nThat smallpox should have been constantly present in London\r\nthroughout last century was in nowise surprising. The citizens\r\nlived in a manner to invite and maintain fevers. I shall refer to\r\ntheir food and drink presently, and would now call attention to\r\nthe fact that they were a stay-at-home generation almost beyond\r\npresent-day belief. Cowper did not violate credibility when he\r\nsang--\r\n\r\n      John Gilpin’s spouse said to her dear,\r\n        “Though wedded we have been\r\n      These twice ten tedious years, yet we\r\n        No holiday have seen.”\r\n\r\nThey had no ready means of locomotion, and indeed did not think\r\nof fresh air and exercise. An apprentice or maid from the country\r\nentered London and was immured as in a prison. We know how the\r\nlower orders in our own time huddle together like pigs, unless so\r\nfar as restrained by lodging-house law, but middle-class Londoners\r\na century ago utilised their apartments, with more decency perhaps,\r\nbut with equal ignorance of the virtue of oxygen. The Londoners\r\nwere a densely compacted community, and at night the streets and\r\nlanes of the city were almost as thickly tenanted as a man-of-war,\r\nbut without benefit of sea-air. A Quaker told me that he served\r\nhis apprenticeship to a grocer in Cheapside between 1786 and 1793,\r\nthat the shop was opened at seven in the morning and closed at\r\nten at night, that he slept under the counter, that his ablutions\r\nwere limited to his countenance, and that he never went out except\r\nto meeting on First Days; adding, that he had no sense of being\r\nhardly dealt with; it was the custom of the time, and he was as\r\nhis fellows. Memoirs of the 18th century prove that he spoke the\r\nsimple truth. Bishop Wilson of Calcutta records that he served in\r\nthe house of a silk merchant in Milk Street from 1792 to 1797,\r\nthat he was occupied from six or seven in the morning till eight\r\nat night; that there was supper at 8.30, followed by prayers, and\r\nthat all went to bed at ten. An apprentice in the same house said\r\nthat he never put on his hat for weeks together, and that more\r\nthan three years elapsed before his first holiday was granted.\r\nWilliam Cobbett in 1783 got into a lawyer’s office in Gray’s Inn\r\nwhere, he relates, “I worked like a galley slave from five in\r\nthe morning till eight or nine at night, and sometimes all night\r\nlong. I never quitted this gloomy recess except on Sundays when\r\nI usually took a walk to St. James’s Park.” Such instances might\r\nbe multiplied to any extent; and in short it comes to this, that\r\nthe Londoners of last century lived from year to year _in_ their\r\nhouses, and had no outdoor exercise. If they were careless about\r\nair, they were equally careless about light, and, but for the cost\r\nof candles, might have disregarded it altogether. Water was chiefly\r\nbrought from wells or conduits, and was used sparingly; and it is\r\nneedless to add, there were no water-closets. Even in well-ordered\r\nhouseholds, stenches were dreadful; and where there were slatterns,\r\nthe condition of affairs may be faintly imagined. Horrible\r\ncesspools lay behind or beneath most of the houses, evolving\r\npestiferous effluvia. Out of doors, the streets were scarcely less\r\nnoisome. Rain was the chief scavenger. Swift, in his description\r\nof a City Shower, sets before us as graphically as Hogarth, the\r\noffices of the rain--\r\n\r\n      Now in contiguous drops the flood comes down\r\n      Threatening with deluge this devoted town....\r\n      Now from all parts the swelling kennels flow,\r\n      And bear their trophies with them as they go:\r\n      Filths of all hues and odours seem to tell\r\n      What street they sailed from by their sight and smell.\r\n      They, as each torrent drives with rapid force,\r\n      From Smithfield or St. ’Pulchre’s shape their course,\r\n      And in huge confluence joined at Snowhill ridge,\r\n      Fall from the conduit prone to Holborn Bridge.\r\n      Sweepings from butchers’ stalls, dung, guts, and blood,\r\n      Drowned puppies, stinking sprats, all drenched in mud,\r\n      Dead cats, and turnip-tops, come tumbling down the flood.\r\n\r\nNor in estimating the sanitary condition of 18th Century London\r\nis the influence of the dead on the living to be forgotten. The\r\ntwenty thousand who died annually remained to poison the survivors.\r\nThe city grave-yards were places of decomposition rather than of\r\ninterment, and an odour of corpses pervaded many neighbourhoods.\r\nMr. Samuel Gale wrote in 1736--\r\n\r\n  In the church-yard of St. Paul, Covent Garden, the burials are\r\n  so frequent that the place is not capacious enough to contain\r\n  decently the crowds of dead, some of whom are not laid above a\r\n  foot under the loose earth. The cemetery is surrounded every\r\n  way with close buildings; and an acquaintance of mine, whose\r\n  apartments look into the churchyard, hath averred to me that\r\n  the family have often rose in the night-time and been forced to\r\n  burn frankincense and other perfumes to dissipate and break the\r\n  contagious vapour. This is an instance of the danger of infection\r\n  proceeding from the corrupt effluvia of dead bodies.[77]\r\n\r\nChurch-goers were subjected to cadaverous influences from the dead\r\nin the yard without and from the dead in the vaults below; and\r\npious thoughts acquired an indescribable savour of the sepulchre.\r\nMany illnesses originated in church; and families who led\r\nwholesome lives at home were brought into deadly peril when they\r\nturned out on Sundays to public worship.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to enter into these details if we would know what\r\nmanner of people the Londoners were who suffered from smallpox,\r\nand what sort of place London was wherein they suffered. Londoners\r\nhave been taken for the standard of 18th century smallpox, in\r\nforgetfulness of the fact that there did not then exist in England\r\na town of a hundred thousand inhabitants--perhaps only two or three\r\nof fifty thousand; whilst the rural population bore a far larger\r\nproportion to the urban than is the case at this day. In so far\r\nas the sanitary conditions of Bristol, Norwich, or York resembled\r\nthose of London, the analogy between them held good; but to convert\r\nthe London rate of smallpox into the common rate of England, of\r\nEurope, and of the world, and to use the appalling result as a\r\nwhip of terror wherewith to enforce universal inoculation, and\r\nafterwards vaccination, was sheer absurdity, if not something worse.\r\n\r\nWhilst smallpox was always present in London, its appearance in the\r\ncountry was irregular and usually epidemic. The Bills of Mortality\r\nof towns as large as Northampton were sometimes clear of smallpox\r\nfor years. Sir Gilbert Blane, in his advocacy of Vaccination\r\n_versus_ Inoculation, said, that previous to the practice of\r\ninoculation there were many parts of the country where smallpox was\r\nunknown for periods of twenty, thirty, and even forty years. Mr.\r\nConnah, a surgeon of Seaford, Sussex, with a population of 700,\r\ninformed Dr. Haygarth in 1782, that one person had died of smallpox\r\nin Seaford about eleven years before, and he could not ascertain\r\nthat any other death from the disease had occurred subsequently;\r\nand that there was reason to believe that a like immunity prevailed\r\nthroughout the smaller towns and villages of the southern counties.\r\nWherever we inquire, we are driven to the conclusion that the\r\nprevalence and fatality of smallpox in the 18th century were\r\ngrossly exaggerated by quacks and panicmongers. Nor should we\r\nforget in this connection how Professor Waterhouse, of Boston, an\r\nardent inoculator, had to write in 1787--\r\n\r\n  I do not believe there is at present a single person infected by\r\n  smallpox in all the four New England Governments; that is, not\r\n  one in a million of people.\r\n\r\nWhat we have to say of London smallpox during last century is,\r\nthat prevalent as it was, our wonder is that it was not more\r\nprevalent; that the disease was bred in the circumstances and\r\nhabits of the citizens; and that if it were possible to reproduce\r\nthe same conditions, we should reproduce the same smallpox. On the\r\ncontrary, say our valiant vaccinators, the same conditions might be\r\nreproduced, but if the citizens were universally and efficiently\r\nvaccinated and re-vaccinated, there would be no smallpox. Thus\r\nwe are taught that people may eat and drink as they like, live\r\nin darkness, neglect personal cleanliness, take little exercise,\r\nbreathe air polluted by respiration, filth, and putrefaction, and\r\nthat whatever disease overtakes them, they will be proof against\r\nsmallpox. The promise is deceptive, but it was the promise of\r\nthe inoculator, and it is the promise of the vaccinator; and Dr.\r\nDrysdale, describes the practice which warrants the promise as “the\r\ngreatest triumph of hygienic science--I repeat, by far the greatest\r\ntriumph of positive hygienic science ever made.”[78]\r\n\r\nSome share in the fatality of 18th century smallpox must be charged\r\nto the treatment of the disease. What was described as the cool\r\nregimen was no secret, yet its practice appears to have been\r\nlimited to few; whilst with the multitude, patients were confined\r\nto close and heated rooms, under heavy bed-clothes, plied with hot\r\ndrinks, cordials, and alcohol, and kept in foul linen until killed\r\nor cured. Frequently, when symptoms of smallpox appeared, bleeding,\r\nblistering, and purging were energetically resorted to. If a family\r\nof children were affected, they were commonly stowed away in one\r\nbed, and their skins would stick together with pus and sweat. It\r\nwas much the same in hospitals and workhouses. “I have seen above\r\nforty children,” says Dr. Buchan, “cooped up in one apartment, all\r\nthe while they had this disease, without any of them being admitted\r\nto breathe the fresh air.” The same course was pursued with other\r\nfevers, and the effluvia of the sick-room was overpowering. Take\r\nthis instance from Jenner’s own household. His nephew, Henry, and\r\na maid-servant, were seized with typhus, and Jenner wrote--\r\n\r\n  The stench from the poor girl is so great as to fill the house\r\n  with putrid vapour; and I shall remove Henry this morning, by\r\n  means of a sedan chair, to an adjacent cottage.[79]\r\n\r\nIndeed, the cleanliness and ventilation we consider so salutary\r\nwere sedulously avoided. Cold air was accounted specially\r\npernicious, and occasionally when the poor, afflicted with\r\nsmallpox, were exposed to the weather, astonishment was expressed\r\nthat recovery instead of death was the issue. It is related in\r\nHutchins’s _History of Dorset_ that Blandford was burnt down in\r\n1731, and several patients in smallpox were laid under the arches\r\nof the bridge as a place of refuge, and, to the general surprise,\r\nall got well, although many had died in their beds before the fire.\r\nJohn Birch a London surgeon of high repute, writing in 1814, sums\r\nup the case for us on this head in saying--\r\n\r\n  I consider the natural smallpox a mild disease, and only rendered\r\n  malignant by mistakes in nursing, in diet, and in medicine, and\r\n  by want of cleanliness, which last is the fomes of hospital\r\n  fevers, and all camp and contagious disorders.\r\n\r\n  It would hardly be too bold to say, that the fatal treatment of\r\n  this disease, for two centuries, by warming the chamber, and by\r\n  stimulating and heating cordials, was the cause of two-thirds of\r\n  the mortality which ensued.[80]\r\n\r\nWe now come to an interesting question. If the reader refers to\r\nthe list of twelve years of greatest smallpox, and to the list of\r\ntwelve years of least smallpox in London, it will be observed that\r\nthe years of least smallpox predominate in the last quarter of\r\nthe century, and this in spite of the diffusion of the disease by\r\nInoculation. The inoculators when charged with increasing smallpox\r\nappealed to the London Bills of Mortality. “Let us,” they said,\r\n“take the last ninety years of the century, and we shall find that\r\nthere died in London of smallpox in the thirty years--\r\n\r\n    From 1711 to 1740 inclusive  65,383\r\n         1741 to 1770    ”       63,308\r\n         1771 to 1800    ”       57,268\r\n\r\nHere we see, that the number of deaths was greater in the first\r\nthirty years by 2075 than in the second thirty years during which\r\nInoculation had acquired some stability, and greater by 8115\r\nthan in the last thirty years, during which Inoculation was the\r\nestablished practice of most prudent families.[81] We are therefore\r\nunjustly accused. These figures leave no doubt that smallpox is\r\ndecreasing, and we claim that the decrease is due to our practice.”\r\n\r\nThe decrease was certain, but I cannot allow that it was due to\r\nInoculation; on the contrary I assume that the decrease would have\r\nbeen greater but for the culture of the disease by the inoculators.\r\nThe fact is extremely distressing to the more rabid vaccinators,\r\nand Dr. Corfield tries to curse it out of existence as “the falsest\r\nof falsehoods;” but there it abides. It is hard for those who\r\nrepresent Jenner as the saviour of mankind from smallpox to have it\r\nshown that Londoners, at least, were in process of salvation before\r\nhis intervention; but facts, alas! are cruelly unkind to theorists,\r\nsentimentalists, and quacks of all sorts. In the words of Dr. Farr--\r\n\r\n  Smallpox attained its maximum mortality after Inoculation was\r\n  introduced. The annual deaths from smallpox from 1760 to 1779\r\n  were on an average 2323. In the next twenty years, 1780 to 1799\r\n  they declined to 1740. The disease, therefore, began to grow\r\n  less fatal before Vaccination was discovered; indicating,\r\n  together with the diminution of fevers, the general improvement\r\n  of health then taking place.[82]\r\n\r\nThe decrease of smallpox towards the close of the century, says Dr.\r\nFarr, was due to “the general improvement of health then taking\r\nplace;” but to what was that improvement due? No marked improvement\r\nhad been effected in the sanitary arrangements of London--why then\r\nthis change for the better? My answer is, that a great alteration\r\nwas in progress in the popular diet.\r\n\r\nDr. George Cheyne, in his famous _Essay of Health and Long Life_,\r\npublished in 1724, says--\r\n\r\n  There is no chronical distemper whatsoever more universal, more\r\n  obstinate, and more fatal in Britain, than the Scurvy taken in\r\n  its general extent.\r\n\r\nAnd more than fifty years afterwards, in 1783, we have Dr. Buchan\r\nbearing similar testimony--\r\n\r\n  The disease most common to this country is the Scurvy. One finds\r\n  a dash of it in almost every family, and in some the taint is\r\n  very deep.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to cite authority for what was so\r\ngenerally known and confessed; but in this question of smallpox and\r\nits prevention we have to deal with many who appear to be destitute\r\nof any historic sense; who argue as if what Englishmen are to-day,\r\nthey always were; and who contend that as there was more smallpox\r\nin London before Jenner than since Jenner, therefore Jenner must be\r\nthe cause of the diminution. It is necessary to condescend to such\r\nfeeble folk.\r\n\r\nThe cause of the general scorbutic habit of the people was widely\r\nrecognised by medical men, and Buchan merely repeated their common\r\nopinion in saying--\r\n\r\n  A disease so general must have a general cause, and there is none\r\n  so obvious as the great quantity of animal food devoured by the\r\n  natives of this island. As a proof that Scurvy arises from this\r\n  cause, we are in possession of no remedy for that disease equal\r\n  to the free use of vegetables.[83]\r\n\r\nCheyne said much the same at the earlier date. He complained that\r\nthe upper classes gorged themselves with animal food, and slaked\r\ntheir thirst with wine, “which is now [1724] become common as\r\nwater, and the better sort scarce ever dilute their food with any\r\nother liquor.” Beer had the place of wine among the middle and\r\nlower orders. In the words of Buchan--\r\n\r\n  The English labourer lives chiefly on bread, which being\r\n  accompanied with other dry, and often salt food, fires his blood\r\n  and excites an unquenchable thirst, so that his perpetual cry is\r\n  for drink.\r\n\r\nHe adds--\r\n\r\n  If men will live on dry bread, poor cheese, salt butter, broiled\r\n  bacon, and such like parching food, they _will_ find their way\r\n  to the alehouse--the bane of the lower orders, and the source of\r\n  half the beggary in the nation.\r\n\r\nWere we to say that the diet of the English for the greater part\r\nof last century consisted of Bread, Beef, and Beer, we should\r\nnot go far wrong. The London bread was then, as now, poor stuff;\r\n“spoiled,” says Buchan, “to please the eye, artificially whitened,\r\nyet what most prefer, and the poorer sort will eat no other.”\r\nWhenever it could be obtained, beer was the beverage that went\r\nwith bread, and was drank by young and old. Salt beef and mutton,\r\nbacon, salt fish, and butchers’ offal completed the dietary of the\r\nmultitude. The feeding of the poor in hard seasons exercised the\r\nbeneficent severely, for the baker’s bill often went far to exhaust\r\nthe working-man’s earnings.\r\n\r\nIt was easy to recommend the rich to get rid of their scurvy by\r\na resort to vegetable food, but to the poor with their obstinate\r\nprejudices, shiftlessness, and ignorance, such a recommendation was\r\na sort of mockery. Deliverance, however, came in a form recommended\r\nby pleasantness and economy, namely, in the potato. It is true\r\nthe tuber had been known long before, but not as an article of\r\nfree and ordinary consumption. Toward the middle of the century\r\nit was discovered that potatoes could be grown cheaply in large\r\nquantities, and supply and demand developed together. Women and\r\nchildren especially rejoiced in the new food, whilst the benevolent\r\nexulted in the liberal accession to the poor man’s fare. It became\r\na point of duty with Lord and Lady Bountiful to recommend the\r\nculture and consumption of potatoes everywhere; and to see how far\r\nthe substitution of potatoes for bread had extended early in the\r\nnineteenth century, we need only refer to the pages of Cobbett,\r\nwho denounced the change with unwearied virulence as a degradation\r\nof humanity. Certainly potatoes are inferior to bread in nutritive\r\nvalue, but in food we have to look for more than mere nutriment;\r\nand the general use of the potato went far to purify and ameliorate\r\nthe blood of the English people.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the potato as a cheap constituent of common\r\nfare, was an argument wherewith Jenner endeavoured to allay\r\napprehensions, that, having stopped smallpox, there would soon\r\nbe more mouths than food to fill them. To Dunning he wrote, 10th\r\nFebruary, 1805--\r\n\r\n  I have often urged the following argument when too numerous a\r\n  population has been thrown in my teeth, as one of the ill effects\r\n  likely to attend vaccination. Who would have thought a century\r\n  ago, that providence had in store for us that nutritious and\r\n  excellent vegetable, the potato--that ready made loaf, as it\r\n  were, which is prepared in higher perfection in the garden of the\r\n  cottager than in the highly manured soil of the man of opulence.\r\n\r\nAnd again to Worthington, 25th April, 1810--\r\n\r\n  What a gift from Heaven was this extraordinary vegetable--a ready\r\n  made loaf; reserved, too, till the hour when population, in these\r\n  realms at least, began first to increase; and then coming we\r\n  scarcely know how. Away with Malthus and his dreary speculations!\r\n  The skies are filled with benevolence, and let population\r\n  increase how it may, let us not distrust and suppose that men\r\n  will ever pick the bones of each other.[84]\r\n\r\nNor was the change in the people’s diet limited to the introduction\r\nof the potato; with it came tea. Of course we know that tea was\r\ndrank in England long ere George III. was King, but it was in his\r\ndays that tea came into popular use. Here again we may refer to\r\nBuchan, who was strongly opposed to the innovation. He wrote--\r\n\r\n  It is said the inhabitants of Great Britain consume more tea\r\n  than all the other nations of Europe together. The higher ranks\r\n  use tea as a luxury, while the lower orders make a diet of it.\r\n  The lowest woman in England must have her tea, and the children\r\n  generally share it with her. The mischiefs occasioned by tea\r\n  arise chiefly from its being substituted for solid food, and had\r\n  I time to spare, I think it could not be better employed than\r\n  in writing against the destructive drug. Its use will induce a\r\n  total change in the constitutions of the people of this country.\r\n  Indeed, it has gone a great way towards effecting that evil\r\n  already.\r\n\r\nWhat Buchan had not time to do, Cobbett subsequently did, and\r\nsome of his most racy patches of vituperation were applied to tea\r\nand tea-drinkers. In Bacon, Bread and Beer, according to Cobbett,\r\nconsisted the strength of the English working-man, whilst tea and\r\npotatoes he held in abomination.\r\n\r\nTo this partial substitution of potatoes and tea for salted animal\r\nfood and malt liquor, we may justly attribute the reduction of\r\nthe scorbutic habit of the people, and that improvement of health\r\nwhich were coincident with the close of last century and were\r\ncontinued into the present. What every student of vital statistics\r\nhas to remember is, that conditions have to be identical to yield\r\nidentical results. The lives of the majority of the English people\r\nlast century, and notably so in London, were hard and sordid to\r\na degree which in these times is difficult to realise. Their\r\nsanitary conditions have been indicated, and I would now enforce\r\nthe observation, that they were ill fed and insufficiently fed;\r\nconsequently their diseases were malignant, and smallpox not\r\nunfrequently scarred deeply its scorbutic victims. Wherefore to\r\nrun a parallel between the Londoners of the 18th century and the\r\nEnglish of the 19th in the matter of smallpox, and to ascribe\r\nany difference between them to Jenner’s specific, is to display\r\nignorance that is inexcusable, or craft unscrupulous.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[76] “On the Uses and Defects of Parish Registers.” By G.M.\r\nBurrows, M.D. In _London Medical Repository_, No. 58, October 1818.\r\n\r\n[77] Nichols’s _Illustrations of Literary History_, vol. iv. p. 499.\r\n\r\n[78] _The Times_, 23rd Oct. and 4th Dec., 1879.\r\n\r\n[79] Baron’s _Life of Jenner_, vol. i. p. 107.\r\n\r\n[80] _An Appeal to the Public on Vaccination._ By John Birch.\r\n\r\n[81] Dr. Adams in _Medical Journal_, 1810, p. 31.

In Jenner’s case\r\nwe have to deal with an accident rather than with a vigorous\r\npersonification of evil. It was his fate to have a happy (or\r\nunhappy) thought, adapted to the humour and practice of his\r\ntime, which was immediately caught up and carried to world-wide\r\nissues. In himself, he was as ordinary a character as was ever\r\nthrust into greatness. For the mischief of his thought, some of\r\nhis contemporaries were as responsible as himself--some, indeed,\r\nmore blameworthy. With Bishop Butler I may ask, “Why may not\r\nwhole communities be seized with fits of insanity, as well as\r\nindividuals?” and with him aver, “Nothing else can account for a\r\ngreat part of what we read in history.” The common mind passes at\r\ntimes into unwholesome conditions, wherein the words of Paul are\r\nexemplified, “For this cause shall God send them a strong delusion,\r\nthat they should believe a lie.”\r\n\r\nEdward Jenner, the son of a clergyman, was born at Berkeley,\r\nGloucestershire, on 17th May, 1749. After the usual education of\r\na youth of his class, he was apprenticed to Mr. Ludlow, surgeon\r\nand apothecary, of Sodbury, near Bristol; and on the completion\r\nof his time (1770) was sent to London, where he resided for two\r\nyears with Dr. John Hunter, who increased his means for scientific\r\ninquiry by the reception of pupils, caring much more for his\r\nmenagerie at Brompton than for patients, and utilising his pupils\r\nas assistants in his researches. Captain Cook returned from his\r\nfirst voyage of discovery in 1771, and his collection of specimens\r\nof natural history was assigned to Hunter for arrangement, who set\r\nJenner to work upon them; and, it is said, he did his duty so well\r\nthat he was offered the appointment of naturalist in Cook’s next\r\nexpedition. Jenner was, however, eager to commence business as\r\ncountry surgeon, and in 1772, at the age of 23, he returned to his\r\nnative vale, legally qualified by his experience at Sodbury, and\r\nhis two years with Hunter, to practise at discretion on the good\r\nfolk of Berkeley.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that Jenner’s was a poor sort of training for\r\na medical man, but it is to be questioned if he lost much by\r\nhis ignorance; for a century ago medical knowledge was largely\r\nabsurdity, and practice mischief; and he did best who stood most\r\nfrequently helpless in the presence of Nature. Sir Benjamin Brodie\r\nrelates how he served when a young man with a general practitioner\r\nnear Leicester Square--\r\n\r\n  His treatment of disease seemed to be very simple. He had in his\r\n  shop five large bottles, which were labelled _Mistura Salina_,\r\n  _Mistura Cathartica_, _Mistura Astringens_, _Mistura Cinchonæ_,\r\n  and another, of which I forget the name, but it was some kind of\r\n  white emulsion for coughs; and it seemed to me that out of these\r\n  five bottles he prescribed for two-thirds of his patients. I do\r\n  not, however, set this down to his discredit; for I have observed\r\n  that while young members of the medical profession generally deal\r\n  in a great variety of remedies, they commonly discard the greater\r\n  number of them as they grow older, until at last their treatment\r\n  of diseases becomes almost as simple as that of my Æsculapius of\r\n  Little Newport Street.[85]\r\n\r\nHunter’s name is often used as a sort of consecration of Jenner,\r\nbut for no obvious reason. Hunter confirmed, if he did not beget\r\nin Jenner a strong liking for natural history; and when Jenner was\r\nsettled in the country, he often availed himself of his services\r\nas observer and collector, writing to him for information about\r\nthe habits of the cuckoo, the breeding of toads and frogs, and the\r\nsexes of eels; for cuckoos’ stomachs, crows and magpies’ nests, for\r\nbats, hedgehogs, blackbirds, lizards, hares, and fossils; for a\r\ncock salmon, for salmon spawn and fry, for a large porpoise, “for\r\nlove or money;” for the arm of a certain patient when he dies;\r\nsuggesting horrible experiments on hedgehogs, bats, and dogs, and\r\ndescribing one of special atrocity upon an ass. The most serious\r\nproposition in their correspondence was that Jenner should come to\r\nLondon as a teacher of natural history, but Hunter threw out the\r\nsuggestion with hesitation, the qualification for the appointment\r\nbeing 1000 guineas down. Jenner had improved, or supposed he had\r\nimproved, the preparation of tartar emetic, and Hunter wrote--\r\n\r\n  DEAR JENNER,--I am puffing off your tartar as the tartar of all\r\n  tartars, and have given it to several physicians to make a trial\r\n  of, but as yet have had no account of their success. Had you\r\n  not better let a bookseller have it to sell, as Glass of Oxford\r\n  did his magnesia? Let it be called Jenner’s Tartar Emetic, or\r\n  anybody’s else you please.\r\n\r\nHunter died in 1793, and there is no evidence that Jenner submitted\r\nto his judgment the question of Vaccination, if even we allow that\r\nprior to that date the project had occurred to Jenner himself.\r\nIt is certain that he mentioned to Hunter that country folk\r\nbelieved that to catch cowpox was to be secure from smallpox, and\r\nthat Hunter repeated the fact in his conversation and lectures;\r\nbut there is no reference to the matter in Hunter’s writing and\r\ncorrespondence.\r\n\r\nIt is the habit of Jenner’s admirers to represent him as a patient\r\ninvestigator to whom a great thought dawned in boyhood, which was\r\nbrought forth in the maturity of life. In conformity with this\r\nlegend, it is related that when an apprentice at Sodbury, a young\r\nwoman came to his master’s surgery, and smallpox being mentioned,\r\nshe said, “I cannot take that disease, for I have had cowpox;” and\r\nher observation was pondered in his heart; whereon Dr. Baron, his\r\nbiographer, ecstatically launches forth--\r\n\r\n  Newton had unfolded his doctrine of light and colours before he\r\n  was twenty: Bacon wrote his _Temporis Partus Maximus_ before he\r\n  attained that age: Montesquieu had sketched his _Spirit of Laws_\r\n  at an equally early period of life: and Jenner, when he was still\r\n  younger, contemplated the possibility of removing from among the\r\n  list of human diseases one of the most mortal that ever scourged\r\n  our race. The hope of doing this great good never deserted him,\r\n  though he met with many discouragements; his notions having been\r\n  treated with scorn and ridicule by some, and with indifference by\r\n  almost all.\r\n\r\nAgainst such a paragraph we may write, Sheer romance! Jenner was by\r\nno means reticent, and that the prevention of smallpox was for any\r\nlength of time the burden of his soul, nowhere appears. The romance\r\ncame into being after date in order to make much of little, and to\r\njustify payment in cash and reputation. For, taking Vaccination\r\nat the utmost, it was a slight advance upon existent knowledge\r\nand practice. In the first place, it was a notorious belief in\r\nmany dairy districts, that to contract cowpox was equivalent to\r\nsmallpox in averting a subsequent attack of smallpox. In the\r\nsecond place, inoculation with smallpox was the custom of the\r\ntime; and if infection with cowpox prevented smallpox, why should\r\nnot inoculation with cowpox do so as effectually as inoculation\r\nwith smallpox? The intelligence requisite to reach a conclusion so\r\nobvious was not great, and therefore it was no cause for surprise\r\nthat when Jenner’s claim as originator of Vaccination was brought\r\nforward, his priority should be disputed from several quarters; as\r\nby Benjamin Jesty of Yetminster, who inoculated his wife and sons\r\nwith cowpox in 1774; by Nash of Shaftesbury; Mrs. Rendall, and\r\nothers. Jenner was not insensible to the force of these claims, but\r\nevaded them under the plea that there was cowpox _and_ cowpox, and\r\nthat he had discovered and defined the right sort.\r\n\r\nIn parts of Holstein, too, cowpox was regarded as good against\r\nsmallpox, and on more than one occasion was deliberately\r\nemployed for the purpose. Plett, a village schoolmaster, near\r\nKiel, inoculated three children with the disease in 1791, who\r\nwere afterwards credited with resisting variolous infection in\r\nconsequence of their vaccination.[86]\r\n\r\nHow thoroughly the asserted prophylaxy of cowpox was known, Jenner\r\nhimself was accustomed to bear witness. He was a member of two\r\nclubs, the Medico-Convivial which met at Rodborough, and the\r\nConvivio-Medical which met at Alveston; and he used to bring cowpox\r\nso persistently under discussion, that, he said, he was threatened\r\nwith expulsion if he did not desist. “We know,” said the jovial\r\ndoctors, “that an attack of cowpox is reputed to prevent smallpox,\r\nbut we know that it does not, and that should end the matter.”[87]\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the tactics that would represent Vaccination as\r\nthe outcome of the labour of many years, we have the following\r\nextraordinary narrative from Baron, Jenner’s biographer--\r\n\r\n  It was not till 1780 that Jenner was enabled, after much study\r\n  and inquiry, to unravel many of the perplexing obscurities and\r\n  contradictions with which the question of cowpox was enveloped,\r\n  and which had impressed those who knew the traditions of the\r\n  country with the opinion that it defied all accurate and\r\n  satisfactory elucidation. In the month of May of the year just\r\n  mentioned, 1780, he first disclosed his hopes and his fears,\r\n  respecting the great object of his pursuit, to his friend Edward\r\n  Gardner. By this time _Jenner’s mind had caught a glimpse of\r\n  the reputation which awaited him_, but it was still clouded by\r\n  doubts and difficulties. He then seemed to feel that it might, in\r\n  God’s good providence, _be his lot to stand between the living\r\n  and the dead, and that through him a plague might be stayed_. On\r\n  the other side, the dread of disappointment, and the probability\r\n  of failing to accomplish his purpose, restrained that eagerness\r\n  which otherwise would have prompted him prematurely to publish\r\n  the result of his inquiries, and thereby, probably, by conveying\r\n  insufficient knowledge, blight forever his favourite hope.[88]\r\n\r\nMany are the marvellous relations in ancient and modern history,\r\nbut in the records of the supernatural it is questionable if there\r\nbe anything to match the preceding. Painters depict the runaway\r\napprentice listening on Highgate Hill to the bells as they pealed,\r\n“Turn again Whittington, twice Lord Mayor of London,” but they\r\nmight find a finer subject in the young Gloucestershire surgeon,\r\naged 31, habited “in blue coat and yellow buttons, buckskins, well\r\npolished jockey boots with handsome silver spurs, a smart whip with\r\nsilver handle, and hair done up in a club under a broad-brimmed\r\nhat,”[89] with eye fixed in vision, contemplating his glorious\r\ndestiny, through clouds of doubt and difficulty, full twenty years\r\nahead; standing like another Aaron, censer in hand, between the\r\nliving and the dead until the plague was stayed! Verily, if we do\r\nnot see miracles, it is because we do not choose to look for them.\r\n\r\nThe chapter of the wonderful is not exhausted; yet greater things\r\nremain. Says Baron, and recollect the year was 1780 and Jenner aged\r\n31--\r\n\r\n  Jenner was riding with Gardner, on the road between Gloucester\r\n  and Bristol, near Newport, when the conversation passed of which\r\n  I have made mention. He went over the natural history of cowpox;\r\n  stated his opinion as to the origin of this affection from the\r\n  heel of the horse; specified the different sorts of disease which\r\n  attacked the milkers when they handled infected cows; dwelt upon\r\n  the variety which afforded protection against smallpox; and with\r\n  deep and anxious emotion mentioned his hope of being able to\r\n  propagate that variety from one human being to another, till he\r\n  had disseminated the practice all over the globe, to the total\r\n  extinction of smallpox--\r\n\r\nWhich is to say, that in 1780, Jenner, aged 31, had arrived at the\r\nconclusion which he offered to the world in 1798 at the mature\r\nage of 49; and in the meanwhile allowed mankind to perish from\r\nsmallpox, he having their salvation in his hands!\r\n\r\nThe miraculous conversation, says Baron, was concluded by Jenner in\r\nwords to the following effect--\r\n\r\n  Gardner, I have entrusted a most important matter to you, which\r\n  I firmly believe will prove of essential benefit to the human\r\n  race. I know you, and should not wish what I have stated to be\r\n  brought into conversation; for should anything untoward turn up\r\n  in my experiments I should be made, particularly by my medical\r\n  brethren, the subject of ridicule--for I am the mark they all\r\n  shoot at.[90]\r\n\r\nGardner, Jenner’s friend, who played the part of _alter ego_ in\r\nthe asseveration of an early date for Vaccination, was a dealer\r\nin wines and spirits. Charity believeth all things, but even\r\ncharity would exhibit a sceptical countenance when what it is\r\na man’s interest to prove and have placed to his credit, is in\r\nitself improbable; which, if true, might be proved by documents\r\nand witnesses; but which is merely supported by his own word\r\nand that of a friend. Let me repeat, there was never a vestige\r\nof evidence adduced for the revelations of 1780 beyond the bare\r\nassertions of Jenner and Gardner; and further, that they are\r\nradically at variance with the tenor and dates of Jenner’s first\r\npublication--_The Inquiry_ of 1798.\r\n\r\nThe next date to which we come is 1787, in which year Jenner is\r\nrepresented as having taken his nephew, George, into a stable to\r\nlook at a horse with diseased heels--\r\n\r\n“There,” said he, pointing to the horse’s heels, “is the source of\r\nsmallpox. I have much to say on that subject, which I hope in due\r\ntime to give to the world.”[91]\r\n\r\nBaron gives no authority for this anecdote. It is probably\r\nante-dated six or seven years.\r\n\r\nIn 1788 Jenner married Catherine Kingscote. In his domestic\r\nrelations, he was devotedly affectionate, even uxorious; ready to\r\ndefer any duty and to surrender any advantage to the pleasures of\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nAs the phrase ran, Jenner was a good hand at a “copy of verses,”\r\nand one of these, “Signs of Rain,” commencing--\r\n\r\n      The hollow winds begin to blow,\r\n      The clouds look black, the glass is low--\r\n\r\nhas a place in nearly all poetical collections.\r\n\r\nIn 1792 Jenner applied to the University of St. Andrews for the\r\ndegree of Doctor of Physic. It cost £15, and nothing more.\r\n\r\nHunter used to say to speculative pupils, “Don’t _think_, but\r\n_try_; be patient, be accurate;” and Jenner, in relation to cowpox,\r\nrequired the advice; for, by his own account, he was content to\r\n_think_ of cowpox for at least a quarter of a century, whilst he\r\nknew by intuition its true origin, its magical efficacy, and future\r\ntriumph without any _trial_. His first experiment was made in\r\nNovember, 1789, upon his son Edward, his first-born, an infant of\r\neighteen months.\r\n\r\n“He was inoculated with cowpox?”\r\n\r\nO, no!\r\n\r\n“Then with grease from a horse’s heel?”\r\n\r\nNot at all!\r\n\r\n“With what then?”\r\n\r\nWhy, with swinepox; and it answered!\r\n\r\nThe child sickened on the eighth day; a few pustules appeared; they\r\nwere late and slow in their progress, and small, but they proved\r\nsufficient. The poor child was then put through what was styled the\r\nVariolous Test: not once or twice, but five or six times at various\r\nintervals, he was inoculated with smallpox without other obvious\r\neffect than local inflammation and erysipelas. Nothing ever claimed\r\nfor cowpox turned out more satisfactorily than this experiment with\r\nswinepox--supposing we trust Jenner.\r\n\r\nArguing from the records (and we have nothing else to argue from)\r\nit was not until about 1795 that Jenner turned his attention with\r\nserious purpose to cowpox. This Baron allows, saying--\r\n\r\n  Many years elapsed before Jenner had an opportunity of completing\r\n  his projected experiments in Vaccination, and he encountered\r\n  numerous difficulties in carrying on the preliminary part of his\r\n  inquiry.[92]\r\n\r\nBut Baron fails to specify what were the projected experiments, or\r\nthe difficulties which hindered their performance. It is a common\r\nnuisance in “sympathetic” biographies to have unlimited drafts made\r\nupon one’s credulity. The evidence of example would go to prove\r\nthat Jenner placed his trust in swinepox rather than cowpox, at\r\nleast as late as 1789.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1795, a general inoculation took place at Berkeley on\r\nDimsdale’s plan; that is to say, all in the district who had not\r\nhad smallpox were inoculated with the disease, so that they might\r\nsicken together and do no mischief. Among the Berkeleyans was one\r\nJoseph Merret, who, 1770, had attended horses with greasy heels\r\nand at the same time milked cows, and from the cows had contracted\r\ncowpox. Jenner inoculated him repeatedly with smallpox on this\r\noccasion, but with no effect; whence he concluded that the attack\r\nof cowpox in 1770 had maintained Merret secure from smallpox for\r\nfive-and-twenty years.[93]\r\n\r\nJenner’s aim was now directed to demonstrate that the common faith\r\nin cowpox as a defence against smallpox was well-founded; and to do\r\nso it was necessary to clear away two objections--\r\n\r\nFIRST, That some who had caught cowpox had subsequently suffered\r\nsmallpox.\r\n\r\nTo which he answered--\r\n\r\nVarious eruptions occur on the teats of cows, which are confounded\r\nwith cowpox, and infect the milkers; and these, I admit, do not\r\nprotect from smallpox.\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Edward Gardner in 1798 he remarked--\r\n\r\n  The _true_ has many imitations by the _false_ on the cow’s udder\r\n  and nipples; and all is called _cowpox_ whether on the cow or\r\n  communicated to the human.[94]\r\n\r\nSECOND, That some who had contracted true cowpox had nevertheless\r\nfallen victims to smallpox.\r\n\r\nTo which he answered--\r\n\r\nAdmitted: but then the milker had not received infection from the\r\ncow at the proper time, but at a stage of the eruption too early or\r\ntoo late.\r\n\r\nIf the reader will set these points clearly before him, he will\r\nhave the measure of Jenner’s claim. It was a claim to define the\r\ntruth there was in a popular belief--not to make an independent\r\ndiscovery.\r\n\r\nJenner at this juncture had staked his hope on the identification\r\nof horsegrease with cowpox. Yet even in this identification he does\r\nnot seem to have been original.\r\n\r\nIt was a persuasion among the farmers that pox on the cows\r\nwas derived from grease on the horse; and that infection with\r\nhorsegrease was just as good against smallpox as infection with its\r\nderivative cowpox. The fact, however, of this derivation of cowpox\r\nfrom horsegrease was contested, but Jenner was positive. Writing in\r\n1794 he said--\r\n\r\n  At our last meeting our friend treated my discovery of the origin\r\n  of cowpox as chimerical. Farther investigation has convinced\r\n  me of the truth of my assertion beyond the possibility of a\r\n  denial.[95]\r\n\r\nChallenged to produce direct evidence that grease from the horse\r\nproduced pox in the cow, he met with considerable difficulty, so\r\nthat on 2nd August, 1797, he had to write--\r\n\r\n  The simple experiment of applying the matter from the heel of the\r\n  horse, in its proper state, to the nipples of the cows, when they\r\n  are in a proper state to be infected by it, is not so easily made\r\n  as at first sight may be imagined. After waiting with impatience\r\n  for months in my own neighbourhood, without effect, I sent a\r\n  messenger to Bristol, in vain, to procure the true virus. I even\r\n  procured a young horse, kept him constantly in the stable, and\r\n  fed him with beans in order to make his heels swell, but to no\r\n  purpose.[96]\r\n\r\nIn the matter of horsegrease, it is to be observed as Dr. Mason\r\nGood informs us, “that for ages blacksmiths and farriers, who\r\nhad been infected with grease, were considered as generally\r\ninsusceptible of variolous contagion.”[97] Wherefore, to Jenner is\r\nnot to be ascribed the discovery of horsegrease as good against\r\nsmallpox; but merely that he held with certain farmers that it was\r\nthe cause of cowpox, and one in constitution with cowpox; and thus\r\nendeavoured to combine the tradition of the stable with that of the\r\ndairy.\r\n\r\nIt was not until 1796 that Jenner made any experiment with\r\ncowpox--up to that date, whatever his visions, he was in Hunter’s\r\nphrase a _thinker_, not a _trier_. On 14th May of that year, he\r\ntook matter from the hand of Sarah Nelmes, who had been infected by\r\nher master’s cows, and inserted it by two incisions in the arm of\r\nJames Phipps, a child of eight years of age. The boy went through\r\nthe disease in a regular manner, and on the 1st July was inoculated\r\nwith smallpox without effect, to Jenner’s intense satisfaction. He\r\ncommunicated the event to Gardner in the following letter--\r\n\r\n    BERKELEY, 19th July, 1796.\r\n\r\n  DEAR GARDNER,--As I promised to let you know how I proceeded in\r\n  my inquiry into the nature of that singular disease the Cowpox,\r\n  and being fully satisfied how much you feel interested in its\r\n  success, you will be gratified in hearing that I have at length\r\n  accomplished what I have been so long waiting for, the passing of\r\n  the Vaccine Virus from one human being to another by the ordinary\r\n  mode of inoculation.\r\n\r\n  A boy of the name of Phipps was inoculated in the arm from the\r\n  pustule on the hand of a young woman who was infected by her\r\n  master’s cows. Having never seen the disease but in its casual\r\n  way before, that is when communicated from the cow to the hand\r\n  of the milker, I was astonished at the close resemblance of the\r\n  pustules, in some of their stages, to the variolous pustules.\r\n\r\n  But now listen to the most delightful part of my story. The boy\r\n  has since been inoculated for the smallpox, which, as I ventured\r\n  to predict, produced no effect. I shall now pursue my experiments\r\n  with redoubled ardour.\r\n\r\nBut the experiments could _not_ be pursued, for, from July, 1796\r\ntill the spring of 1798, Cowpox disappeared from the dairies around\r\nBerkeley, and, as we have seen, horsegrease was also unattainable.\r\nJenner had, however, resolved on publication. Life was advancing;\r\nhe had made no mark in the world; and, as he wrote to Gardner--\r\n\r\n  Added to all my other cares, I am touched hard with the reigning\r\n  epidemic--Impecuniosity.\r\n\r\nAt first he proposed to embody his views in a paper for the Royal\r\nSociety, but on second thoughts determined to issue a pamphlet.\r\nHaving read his manuscript to Dr. Worthington, Mr. Paytherus, and\r\nMr. H. Hicks, assembled round the table of Mr. Thomas Westfaling,\r\nat Rudhall, near Ross, Herefordshire, and having secured their\r\napproval, the matter was put to press, and about the end of June,\r\n1798, appeared--\r\n\r\n    AN\r\n    INQUIRY\r\n    INTO\r\n    THE CAUSES AND EFFECTS\r\n    OF THE\r\n    VARIOLÆ VACCINÆ,\r\n    A DISEASE\r\n    DISCOVERED IN SOME OF THE WESTERN COUNTIES OF ENGLAND,\r\n    PARTICULARLY\r\n    GLOUCESTERSHIRE,\r\n    AND KNOWN BY THE NAME OF\r\n    THE COW POX.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[85] _Autobiography of Sir B.

Thirty years elapsed before the fruit was borne\r\n  to the public; _but incessantly he thought, and watched, and\r\n  experimented on the subject_, and the work in which at length he\r\n  recorded the incomparable results of his labour may well have\r\n  commanded the confidence of reflecting persons.\r\n\r\n  Little would ever be heard of objections to Vaccination, if all\r\n  who undertake the responsibility of its performance, and all who\r\n  feel disposed to resist its adoption, _would but thoroughly study\r\n  that masterpiece of medical induction_, and imitate the patience\r\n  and caution and modesty with which Jenner laid the foundations of\r\n  every statement he advanced.\r\n\r\n  In the first _Inquiry into the Causes and Effects of the Variolæ\r\n  Vaccinæ_, Jenner set on a scientific basis the popular belief to\r\n  which I have referred; and the close of the 18th Century, which\r\n  had much to darken it, will be remembered till the end of human\r\n  history for the greatest physical good ever yet given by science\r\n  to the world.--_Papers relating to the History and Practice of\r\n  Vaccination._ Pp. xi. and xii. London, 1857.\r\n\r\nThese are the words of Mr. John Simon, and in them we have the\r\nJennerian legend with the morsel of fact to the mass of fable\r\nwhich characterises legendary matter, ancient and modern. The\r\nrecommendation to “study thoroughly that master-piece of medical\r\ninduction,” Jenner’s _Inquiry_, is a mere flourish of panegyric;\r\nfor, as Mr. Simon was well aware, the book had been out of print\r\nfor half a century, and was practically inaccessible; whilst\r\nits reproduction has usually been considered undesirable in the\r\ninterests of Vaccination, inasmuch as it reveals more than is\r\nexpedient for common knowledge. An idol that is good to swear by is\r\nalways fortified by a convenient obscurity.\r\n\r\nThe _Inquiry_ is a quarto of less than seventy pages in large\r\ntype, set in broad margins in the grand style of the period,\r\nand illustrated with four coloured plates. There are eight pages\r\nof Introductory Matter, followed by thirty-four pages of Cases,\r\nconcluding with twenty-six pages of General Observations.\r\n\r\nIt is to the Cases as the ground of the argument, that I would\r\nfirst direct attention. They are twenty-three, and may be thus\r\nassorted--\r\n\r\n    13 of Cowpox communicated by accident.\r\n\r\n     4 of Horsegrease communicated by accident and inoculated by design.\r\n\r\n     6 of Cowpox inoculated by design or transferred from arm-to-arm.\r\n\r\nIt may be tedious, but I should like to go with the reader over\r\nthese Cases, for they are highly instructive. Let us take the first\r\ntwelve of Cowpox communicated by accident.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--JOSEPH MERRET, Gardener.\r\n\r\nIn 1770 attended to Horses, milked Cows, and caught Cowpox.\r\nAfterwards his family had Smallpox, but he escaped. In 1795 Jenner\r\nrepeatedly inoculated him with Smallpox without effect.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--SARAH PORTLOCK, Farm Servant.\r\n\r\nIn 1771 had Cowpox. In 1792 nursed her child in Smallpox\r\n“conceiving herself secure,” and was at the same time inoculated\r\nwith Smallpox in both arms without effect.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--JOHN PHILLIPS, Tradesman.\r\n\r\nHad Cowpox when nine years old. Was inoculated with Smallpox by\r\nJenner at the age of 62 without effect.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.--MARY BARGE, Farm Servant.\r\n\r\nIn 1767 had Cowpox. In 1791 was inoculated with Smallpox without\r\neffect. Had also acted as nurse to Smallpox patients without\r\ncatching the disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.--MRS. H----, Gentlewoman.\r\n\r\nHad Cowpox when very young, contracted by handling dairy utensils.\r\nWas subsequently exposed to Smallpox, “where it was scarcely\r\npossible for her to have escaped;” and in 1778 was inoculated with\r\nSmallpox by Jenner without effect.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt this point, I would draw attention to the ages of the persons\r\nset forth in these Cases: they were past middle life when the\r\nsusceptibility to Smallpox was either low or extinct. The reason\r\ngiven by Jenner for their production was that he “wished to show\r\nthat the change produced in the constitution by Cowpox is not\r\naffected by time”--a claim which vaccinators at this day surrender,\r\ninsisting on the necessity of re-vaccination to maintain “the\r\nbenign influence;” but apart from that consideration, there was\r\nnothing extraordinary in resistance to inoculated Smallpox. Without\r\nthe intervention of Cowpox, inoculators were constantly meeting\r\npatients who would not “take,” even with repeated attempts, and\r\nespecially among elderly people; and some who obstinately resisted\r\ninoculated Smallpox, subsequently contracted the disease in the\r\nordinary way. So much Jenner himself allowed, saying--\r\n\r\n  There are many who from some peculiarity in habit resist the\r\n  common effects of variolous matter inserted into the skin, and in\r\n  consequence are haunted through life with the distressing idea of\r\n  being insecure from subsequent infection. (P. 60.)\r\n\r\nYet he was pleased to refer this well recognised resistance to\r\nvariolation in those who had had Cowpox to Cowpox, allowing nothing\r\nfor habit of body!\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.--SARAH WYNNE, Dairymaid.\r\n\r\nIn 1796 had Cowpox in May, and “in so violent a degree, that she\r\nwas confined to her bed, and rendered incapable for several days\r\nof pursuing her ordinary vocation.” On 28th March, 1797, she was\r\ninoculated with Smallpox by Jenner without effect.\r\n\r\nUnder this Case Jenner observes, that “among our dairy farmers\r\nthose who have had Smallpox either escape Cowpox, or are disposed\r\nto have it slightly; and as soon as the complaint shows itself\r\namong cattle, assistants are procured, if possible, who are thus\r\nrendered less susceptible of it, otherwise the business of the\r\nfarm could scarcely go forward.” At the farm where Sarah Wynne was\r\nemployed, all had had Smallpox except Sarah, and all save Sarah,\r\nescaped.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.--WILLIAM RODWAY, Dairyman.\r\n\r\nIn 1796 had Cowpox. In 1797 was inoculated with Smallpox by Jenner\r\nwithout effect.\r\n\r\nUnder Rodway’s Case Jenner showed that the farmers were at fault in\r\nsupposing that Smallpox kept off Cowpox. In the dairy where Rodway\r\nwas employed, all the milkers had passed through Smallpox, except\r\nRodway, and all contracted Cowpox; “but there was no comparison\r\nin the severity of the disease as it was felt by them and by\r\nRodway. While he was confined to bed, they were able, without much\r\ninconvenience, to follow their ordinary business.” Thus Jenner\r\nargued that though Smallpox might not keep off Cowpox, it made\r\nCowpox milder.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.--ELIZABETH WYNNE, Dairymaid.\r\n\r\nIn 1759 had Cowpox slightly when 19 years of age. “As the malady\r\nhad shown itself in so slight a manner,” observed Jenner, “and as\r\nit had taken place at so distant a period of her life, I was happy\r\nwith the opportunity of trying the effects of variolous matter upon\r\nher constitution, and on the 28th of March, 1797, I inoculated her”\r\nwithout effect. Nevertheless in the following year, 1798, she again\r\ncaught Cowpox, having a “large pustulous sore” accompanied with\r\n“general lassitude, shiverings, alternating with heat, coldness of\r\nextremities, and a quick and irregular pulse.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.--WILLIAM SMITH, Farm Servant.\r\n\r\n  Although [wrote Jenner as preface to this Case] the Cowpox\r\n  shields the constitution from the Smallpox, and the Smallpox\r\n  proves a protection against its own poison, yet it appears that\r\n  the human body is again and again susceptible of the infectious\r\n  matter of the Cowpox.\r\n\r\nIn 1780, when attending to Horses with sore heels, Smith\r\nconveyed the equine infection to Cows, “and from the Cows it was\r\ncommunicated to Smith. In 1791, the Cowpox broke out at another\r\nfarm where he then lived as a servant, and he became affected with\r\nit a second time; and in 1794 he was so unfortunate as to catch it\r\nagain. The disease was equally as severe the second and third time\r\nas it was on the first.” He was twice inoculated with Smallpox in\r\n1795, and exposed to Smallpox without effect.\r\n\r\n\r\nX.--SIMON NICHOLS, Farm Servant.\r\n\r\nIn 1782 was employed in dressing the sore heels of Horses, and at\r\nthe same time assisted in milking Cows, thereby infecting them and\r\ngenerating Smallpox. Changing his situation, he communicated the\r\ndisease to other Cows, and was himself severely affected. Some\r\nyears afterwards, he was inoculated with Smallpox by Jenner without\r\neffect.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.--WILLIAM STINCHCOMB, Farm Servant.\r\n\r\nIn 1782 had Cowpox severely on the same farm with Nichols. In 1792\r\nhe was inoculated with Smallpox along with a large party, but in\r\nhis case without result. “During the sickening of some of his\r\ncompanions, their symptoms so strongly recalled to his mind his\r\nown state when sickening with the Cowpox, that he very pertinently\r\nremarked their striking similarity.”\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.--HESTER WALKLEY, Farm Servant.\r\n\r\nIn 1782 had Cowpox when she was attended by Jenner. In 1795 she,\r\nand seven other pauper women of Tortsworth, who also had had\r\nCowpox, were inoculated with Smallpox by Henry Jenner without\r\neffect. “This state of security proved a fortunate circumstance,”\r\nobserved Jenner, “as many of the poor women were at the same time\r\nin a state of pregnancy.” Why then, it might have been asked, did\r\nHenry Jenner try to variolate them?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThese Twelve Cases illustrate Jenner’s procedure; and those\r\nfamiliar with scientific methods, and the scrutiny and caution\r\nrequisite to arrive at trustworthy physiological data, will\r\nview with some astonishment his free and easy induction. In the\r\nmajority of the Cases he was without proof that his subjects had\r\nsuffered Cowpox; and the absence of this certainty was the more\r\nremarkable as he knew that the dairy-folk described as Cowpox\r\nseveral varieties of eruption. The same rural observers who held\r\nthat Cowpox averted Smallpox, also held that Smallpox averted\r\nCowpox; and yet Jenner had to show in Rodway’s Case No. vii., that\r\nthey were mistaken; although, granting the thesis that Smallpox\r\nand Cowpox were equivalents and mutually preventive, the rural\r\nfaith ought to have stood justified, and Smallpox shown to be good\r\nagainst Cowpox. Again Jenner allowed that an attack of Cowpox did\r\nnot prevent a subsequent attack of Cowpox, saying--\r\n\r\n  It is singular to observe that the Cowpox virus, although it\r\n  renders the constitution insusceptible of the variolous, should\r\n  nevertheless leave it unchanged with respect to its own action.\r\n\r\nSingular indeed! The observation in presence of the principle\r\nto be established was nothing short of imbecile. If Smallpox\r\nprevented Smallpox, and Cowpox was one with Smallpox, and Cowpox\r\ndid not avert Cowpox, how was Cowpox to avert Smallpox? The\r\ninsusceptibility of Jenner’s subjects to variolous inoculation was,\r\nas observed, of little account. Resistance to inoculated Smallpox\r\nwas of common occurrence, and inoculators practised various dodges\r\nto overcome it. To have made such experiments approximately\r\nconclusive would have required the inoculation with Smallpox of\r\nsubjects of corresponding ages and temperaments who had not passed\r\nthrough Cowpox; and the probability is that the results would not\r\nhave been dissimilar.\r\n\r\nWe must not, however, proceed farther until Cowpox is described;\r\nand for that purpose I cannot do better than cite Jenner verbatim.\r\n\r\n\r\nJENNER’S DESCRIPTION OF COWPOX.\r\n\r\n  Cowpox appears on the nipples of the Cows in the form of\r\n  irregular pustules. At their first appearance they are commonly\r\n  a palish blue, or rather of a colour somewhat approaching to\r\n  livid, and are surrounded by an inflammation. These pustules,\r\n  unless a timely remedy be applied,[98] frequently degenerate into\r\n  phagedenic [spreading] ulcers, which prove extremely troublesome.\r\n  The animals become indisposed, and the secretion of milk is much\r\n  lessened.\r\n\r\n  Inflamed spots now begin to appear on different parts of the\r\n  hands of the domestics employed in milking, and sometimes on\r\n  the wrists, which run on to suppuration, first assuming the\r\n  appearance of the small vesications produced by a burn. Most\r\n  commonly they appear about the joints of the fingers, and at\r\n  their extremities; but whatever parts are affected, if the\r\n  situation will admit, these superficial suppurations put on a\r\n  circular form, with their edges more elevated than their centres,\r\n  and of a colour distantly approaching to blue. Absorption takes\r\n  place, and tumours appear in each axilla [arm-pit].\r\n\r\n  The system becomes affected, the pulse is quickened; shiverings,\r\n  succeeded by heat, general lassitude and pains about the loins\r\n  and limbs, with vomiting, come on. The head is painful, and the\r\n  patient is now and then even affected with delirium. (P. 3.)\r\n\r\nAnd Jenner might have added, with convulsions.\r\n\r\nHaving drawn this alarming picture of the effects of Cowpox, he\r\ninterposes--\r\n\r\n  These symptoms arise principally from the irritation of the\r\n  sores, and not from the primary action of the vaccine virus upon\r\n  the constitution. (P. 5.)\r\n\r\nIf Cowpox meant all this, some might prefer, at least, the risk\r\nof Smallpox; hence the judicious explanation--the irritation of\r\nthe sores, and not the poison in the blood, was the cause of the\r\ndistressing symptoms. Jenner went on--\r\n\r\n  These symptoms, varying in their degrees of violence, generally\r\n  continue from one day to three or four, leaving ulcerated sores\r\n  about the hands, which, from the sensibility of the parts, are\r\n  very troublesome, and commonly heal slowly, frequently becoming\r\n  phagedenic, like those from whence they sprang. During the\r\n  progress of the disease, the lips, nostrils, eyelids, and other\r\n  parts of the body, are sometimes affected with sores; but these\r\n  evidently arise [How evidently?] from their being heedlessly\r\n  rubbed or scratched with the patient’s infected fingers. (P. 5.)\r\n\r\nIt was this serious disease, this communicated Cowpox, which\r\nthe subjects of the foregoing Cases were assumed to have passed\r\nthrough; and Jenner, in conformity with the opinion of the dairies,\r\nheld that they were thereby rendered proof against Smallpox. Whilst\r\nhis Twelve Cases make a show of inquiry, they bear no trace of\r\nextensive or critical research. In the general inoculations then\r\nprevalent, those who had undergone Cowpox were not treated as\r\nprotected (as were those who had had Smallpox) but were “cut” with\r\ntheir neighbours--as, in Case xii., were the eight cowpoxed paupers\r\nof Tortworth. Yet Jenner was at no pains to collect and set forth\r\nthe evidence of other Gloucestershire practitioners, who, in the\r\ncourse of duty, must have known as much of Cowpox as himself, and\r\nmight have set scores of Cases alongside his perfunctory dozen.\r\n\r\nHaving perused Jenner’s description of Cowpox, let us now turn to\r\nhis account of its origin.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERATION OF COWPOX IN HORSEGREASE.\r\n\r\n  There is a disease to which the Horse, from his state of\r\n  domestication, is frequently subject. The Farriers have termed\r\n  it THE GREASE. It is an inflammation and swelling in the heel,\r\n  accompanied in its commencement with small cracks or fissures,\r\n  from which issues a limpid fluid, possessing properties of a\r\n  peculiar kind. This fluid seems capable of generating a disease\r\n  in the human body (after it has undergone the modification I\r\n  shall presently speak of) which bears so strong a resemblance\r\n  to the Smallpox, that I think it highly probable it may be the\r\n  source of that disease.\r\n\r\n  In this Dairy Country a great number of Cows are kept, and the\r\n  office of milking is performed indiscriminately by Men and Maid\r\n  Servants. One of the former having been appointed to apply\r\n  dressings to the heels of a Horse affected with the malady I\r\n  have mentioned, and not paying due attention to cleanliness,\r\n  incautiously bears his part in milking the Cows, with some\r\n  particles of the infectious matter adhering to his fingers.\r\n  When this is the case, it frequently happens that a disease is\r\n  communicated to the Cows, and from the Cows to the Dairy-maids,\r\n  which spreads through the farm until most of the cattle and\r\n  domestics feel its unpleasant consequences. This disease has\r\n  obtained the name of THE COWPOX.\r\n\r\n  Thus the disease makes its progress from the Horse (as I\r\n  conceive) to the nipples of the Cow, and from the Cow to the\r\n  Human Subject. (Pp. 2 and 6.)\r\n\r\nThis conception of the origin and progress of the disease was not\r\nJenner’s specially: he shared it with the farmers to whom it was a\r\nnovelty--\r\n\r\n  The rise of Cowpox in this country may not have been of very\r\n  remote date, as the practice of milking Cows might formerly have\r\n  been in the hands of women only; which I believe is the case now\r\n  in some other dairy countries; and consequently that the Cows\r\n  might not in former times have been exposed to the contagious\r\n  matter brought by the men servants from the heels of Horses.\r\n  _Indeed a knowledge of the source of infection is new in the\r\n  minds of most of the farmers in this neighbourhood_, but has at\r\n  length produced good consequences; and it seems probable from\r\n  the precautions they are disposed to adopt, that the appearance\r\n  of the Cowpox here may either be entirely extinguished or become\r\n  extremely rare. (P. 56.)\r\n\r\nThus Cowpox was to be extinguished by forbidding milkers to handle\r\nHorses’ greasy heels. Jenner himself tried to produce Cowpox in the\r\nmanner described, but without success--\r\n\r\n  It is very easy [he wrote] to procure pus from old sores on the\r\n  heels of Horses. This I have often inserted into scratches made\r\n  with a lancet on the sound nipples of Cows, and have seen no\r\n  other effects from it than simple inflammation. (P. 45.)\r\n\r\nWhat was requisite for success, he concluded, was the limpid fluid\r\nfrom the Horse’s heel at an early stage of the disease, and that it\r\nshould be applied to the Cow’s nipples at a certain season--\r\n\r\n  The virus from the Horses’ heels is most active at the\r\n  commencement of the disease, even before it has acquired a\r\n  pus-like appearance; indeed I am not confident whether this\r\n  property in the matter does not entirely cease as soon as it is\r\n  secreted in the form of pus. I am induced to think it does cease,\r\n  and that it is the thin darkish-looking fluid only, oozing from\r\n  the newly formed cracks in the heels, similar to what sometimes\r\n  appears from erysipelatous blisters, which gives the disease. Nor\r\n  am I certain that the nipples of the Cows are at all times in a\r\n  state to receive the infection. The appearance of the disease\r\n  in the spring and the early part of the summer, when they are\r\n  disposed to be affected with spontaneous eruptions so much more\r\n  frequently than at other seasons, induces me to think, that the\r\n  virus from the Horse must be received upon them when they are in\r\n  this state in order to produce effects. Experiments, however,\r\n  must determine these points. (P. 45.)\r\n\r\nWhilst thus explicit as to what was requisite for the infection of\r\nthe Cow by the Horse, Jenner did not succeed in producing Cowpox\r\nfrom Horsegrease. He had to write--\r\n\r\n  The spring of the year 1797, which I intended particularly to\r\n  have devoted to the completion of this investigation, proved from\r\n  its dryness remarkably adverse to my wishes. No Cowpox appeared\r\n  in the neighbourhood; for it most frequently happens that while\r\n  the farmers’ Horses are exposed to the cold rains of spring their\r\n  heels become diseased. (P. 44.)\r\n\r\nYet without proof, he argued as if he had proof, saying--\r\n\r\n  With respect to the opinion adduced, that the source of the\r\n  infection is a peculiar morbid matter arising in the Horse,\r\n  although I have not been able to prove it from actual experiments\r\n  conducted immediately under my own eye, yet the evidence I have\r\n  adduced appears sufficient to establish it. (P. 43.)\r\n\r\nEvidence adduced! Of evidence there was none. The farmers might\r\nbe right in their opinion that Cowpox sprang from Horsegrease,\r\nbut opinion was not evidence, nor even such assurance as this of\r\nJenner’s--\r\n\r\n  I feel no room for hesitation respecting the common origin of the\r\n  disease, being well convinced that it never appears among the\r\n  Cows unless they have been milked by some who at the same time\r\n  has the care of a Horse affected with diseased heels. (P. 44.)\r\n\r\nBut not even to this conviction did he adhere. “It was highly\r\nprobable,” he thought, “that not only the heels of the Horse, but\r\nother parts of the body of that animal, are capable of generating\r\nthe virus which produces the Cowpox”--\r\n\r\n  An extensive inflammation of the erysipelatous kind appeared\r\n  without any apparent cause upon the upper part of the thigh\r\n  of a sucking Colt, the property of Mr. Millet, a farmer at\r\n  Rockhampton, the inflammation continued several weeks, and at\r\n  length terminated in the formation of three or four small\r\n  abscesses. The inflamed parts were fomented, and dressings were\r\n  applied by some of the same persons who were employed in milking\r\n  the Cows. The number of Cows milked was 24, and the whole of them\r\n  had the Cowpox. The milkers, consisting of the farmer’s wife,\r\n  a man and a maid-servant, were infected by the Cows. The man\r\n  servant had previously gone through the Smallpox, and felt but\r\n  little of the Cowpox. The servant maid had some years before been\r\n  infected with the Cowpox; and she also felt it now in a slight\r\n  degree. But the farmer’s wife, who had never gone through either\r\n  Smallpox or Cowpox felt its effects very severely.\r\n\r\n  That the disease produced upon the Cows by the Colt, and from\r\n  thence conveyed to those who milked them, was the _True_ and\r\n  not the _Spurious_ Cowpox, there can be scarcely any room for\r\n  suspicion; yet it would have been more completely satisfactory\r\n  had the effects of variolous matter [Inoculation with Smallpox]\r\n  been ascertained on the farmer’s wife; but there was a\r\n  peculiarity in her situation which prevented my making the\r\n  experiment. (P. 62.)\r\n\r\nSpurious Cowpox! What was Spurious Cowpox? Here is Jenner’s answer--\r\n\r\n  Pustulous sores frequently appear spontaneously on the nipples\r\n  of the Cows, and instances have occurred, though very rarely, of\r\n  the hands of the servants employed in milking being affected with\r\n  sores in consequence, and even of their feeling an indisposition\r\n  from absorption. These pustules are of a much milder nature than\r\n  those which arise from that contagion which constitutes the\r\n  True Cowpox. They are always free from the bluish or livid tint\r\n  so conspicuous in the pustules of that disease. _No erysipelas\r\n  attends them_, nor do they show any phagedenic disposition, as in\r\n  the other case, but quickly terminate in a scab without creating\r\n  any apparent disorder in the Cow. This complaint appears at\r\n  various seasons of the year, but most commonly in the spring,\r\n  when the Cows are first taken from their winter food and fed with\r\n  grass. It is very apt to appear also when they are suckling their\r\n  young. But _this disease is not to be considered as similar in\r\n  any respect to that of which I am treating_, as it is incapable\r\n  of producing any specific effects upon the Human Constitution.\r\n  However, it is of the greatest consequence to point it out here,\r\n  lest the want of discrimination should occasion an idea of\r\n  security from the infection of the Smallpox, which might prove\r\n  delusive. (Pp. 7 and 8.)\r\n\r\nNothing could be more explicit. COWPOX was of two kinds--True and\r\nSpurious. The Spurious consisted of pustular sores which appeared\r\nspontaneously on the nipples of Cows, and was of no avail against\r\nSmallpox: the True Cowpox, on the other hand, was not a disease of\r\nthe Cow, but of the Horse transmitted to the Cow.\r\n\r\nIt is of prime importance to bear this distinction in mind; for\r\nif it is not borne in mind, much that remains to be told must\r\nappear confused or unintelligible. As we have seen, it was the\r\nbelief of the dairymaids that if they caught Cowpox they would\r\nnever afterwards catch Smallpox. Medical men in practice in\r\nGloucestershire ridiculed the dairymaids’ belief. They said--\r\n\r\n“We know that such is the dairymaids’ faith, but it is mistaken;\r\nfor we know dairymaids who have had Cowpox and afterwards had\r\nSmallpox in spite of their Cowpox.”\r\n\r\nAt this point Jenner intervened, saying--\r\n\r\n“Let us distinguish. Eruptions contracted in milking are\r\nindiscriminately described as Cowpox by dairy-folk; but there\r\nis an eruption attended with erysipelas and fever which has all\r\nthe virtue they claim for it. This variety of eruption does not\r\noriginate on the Cow, but is communicated to the Cow from the\r\nHorse. Thus the dairymaids are right and they are wrong. They are\r\nright when the pox they catch is derived from the Horse through\r\nthe Cow: they are wrong when the pox they catch originates on\r\nthe Cow without the Horse. In short Cowpox proper is of no avail\r\nagainst Smallpox. It is Horsegrease Cowpox that is of sovereign\r\nand infallible virtue. Any maid who receives HORSEGREASE COWPOX\r\ninto her veins is, as she believes, for ever after secure from the\r\ninfection of Smallpox.”\r\n\r\nLet us therefore bear in mind that Jenner’s prescription was not\r\nCowpox but HORSEGREASE COWPOX. It is a point to be insisted upon;\r\nfor, as we shall see, it was lost from sight, and kept out of\r\nsight, to the utter confusion of the question.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe now come to Jenner’s Cases of Horsegrease--for not only were\r\nfarm-folk reputed secure from Smallpox by reason of Cowpox, but\r\nfarriers likewise in consequence of infection with Horsegrease.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.--THOMAS PEARCE, son of a Farrier.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of dressing Horses with sore heels at his father’s\r\nwhen a lad, had sores on his fingers which suppurated, and\r\noccasioned pretty severe indisposition. Six years afterwards,\r\nJenner inoculated him repeatedly with Smallpox, but only produced\r\nslight inflammation, and exposed him to the contagion of Smallpox\r\nwithout effect.\r\n\r\nOn this Case Jenner observed--\r\n\r\n  It is a remarkable fact, and well-known to many, that we are\r\n  frequently foiled in our endeavours to communicate Smallpox by\r\n  inoculation to blacksmiths, who in the country are farriers. They\r\n  often, as in the above instance, either resist the contagion\r\n  entirely, or have the disease anomalously. Shall we not be able\r\n  now to account for this on a rational principle?\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.--JAMES COLE, Farmer.\r\n\r\nWas infected with Horsegrease in the same way as Pearce. Some years\r\nafterwards was inoculated with Smallpox, but only a few eruptions\r\nappeared on his forehead, which passed away without maturation.\r\n\r\n\r\nXV.--ABRAHAM RIDDIFORD, Farmer.\r\n\r\nWas affected with very painful sores in both hands, tumours in each\r\narm-pit, and severe and general indisposition, in consequence of\r\ndressing a Mare that had sore heels. He was attended by a surgeon,\r\nwho recognising a similarity of the sores upon his hands with\r\nthose of Cowpox, and knowing the effect of Cowpox on the human\r\nconstitution, assured him that he never need fear Smallpox; but,\r\ntwenty years afterwards, he caught the disease, which ran its\r\nregular course.\r\n\r\nFrom these Cases Jenner drew this conclusion--\r\n\r\n  Although the absorption of matter from sores on the heels of\r\n  Horses, secures, or nearly secures, the system from variolous\r\n  infection, yet it is possible that this cannot be entirely relied\r\n  upon, until a disease has been generated by morbid matter from\r\n  the Horse on the nipple of the Cow, and passed through that\r\n  medium to the human subject.\r\n\r\nWhich conclusion he repeated thus--\r\n\r\n  The active quality of the virus from the Horse’s heels is greatly\r\n  increased after it has acted on the nipples of the Cow; as it\r\n  rarely happens that the Horse affects his dresser with sores;\r\n  and as rarely that a milkmaid escapes infection when she milks\r\n  infected Cows. (P. 45.)\r\n\r\nFrom this conclusion, Jenner at a subsequent period withdrew.\r\nThe virus from the Horse was employed for inoculation without\r\ntransmission through the Cow, and with results equally\r\nsatisfactory. As we shall find, Jenner used and distributed\r\nEquine Virus neat, which he certified as “the true and genuine\r\nlife-preserving fluid.”\r\n\r\nSo far the Cases set forth described no more than ordinary\r\nGloucestershire experience; but we now come upon ground regarded as\r\npeculiarly Jennerian.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI.--SARAH NELMES, Dairymaid.\r\n\r\nIn 1796 was infected with Cowpox, receiving the virus on a part of\r\nher hand scratched by a thorn. From the large pustulous sore on\r\nSarah’s hand Jenner, on the 14th May, inoculated--\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII.--JAMES PHIPPS, eight years old.\r\n\r\nSaid Jenner, “The more accurately to observe the progress of the\r\ninfection, I selected a healthy boy, about eight years old, for the\r\npurpose of INOCULATION FOR THE COWPOX.” The matter was inserted\r\ninto his arm by two incisions, barely penetrating the cutis, each\r\nabout half an inch long. The inoculation “took,” and was followed\r\nby a chill, loss of appetite, headache, and restless sleep. On the\r\n1st of July, the poor lad was inoculated with Smallpox, and again\r\nseveral months afterwards, it is said, without effect.\r\n\r\n  Here [wrote Jenner] my researches were interrupted till the\r\n  spring of the year 1798, when, from the wetness of the early\r\n  part of the season, many of the farmers’ Horses were affected\r\n  with sore heels, in consequence of which Cowpox broke out among\r\n  several of our dairies, which afforded me an opportunity of\r\n  making further observations upon the curious disease.\r\n\r\nAbout the latter end of February, 1798, William Haynes and Thomas\r\nVirgoe, having to wash a Mare with sore heels, were infected with\r\nGrease, and described their sensations as much the same as when\r\nthey were inoculated with Smallpox. Their infection proved that if\r\nGrease was good against Smallpox, Smallpox was not good against\r\nGrease. Haynes was employed as a milker, and Pox broke out among\r\nhis master’s Cows about ten days after he had first assisted in\r\nwashing the Mare’s heels.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII.--JOHN BAKER, five years old.\r\n\r\nInoculated, 16th March, 1798, with matter taken from a pustule on\r\nthe hand of the aforesaid Thomas Virgoe poisoned with Grease from\r\nthe Mare’s heels. “He became ill on the sixth day with symptoms\r\nsimilar to those excited by Cowpox, and on the eighth was free from\r\nindisposition.”\r\n\r\nOn this case of Horsegrease inoculation, Jenner observed--\r\n\r\n  We have seen that the virus from the Horse is not to be relied\r\n  upon as rendering the system secure from variolous infection,\r\n  but that the matter produced by it on the nipple of the Cow\r\n  is perfectly so. Whether the virus passing from the Horse\r\n  through the human constitution, as in the present instance,\r\n  will produce a similar effect remains to be decided. This would\r\n  have been effected, but the boy was rendered unfit for Smallpox\r\n  Inoculation from having felt the effects of a contagious fever in\r\n  a work-house soon after this experiment was made.\r\n\r\nMark the assumption, “_The virus from the Horse is not to be relied\r\nupon as rendering the system secure from variolous infection, but\r\nthe matter produced by it on the nipples of the Cow is perfectly\r\nso!_” Such was Jenner’s method of induction! How could he leave\r\nthe question undecided? Why not have waited until little Baker\r\nrecovered from his fever? or why not have inoculated another\r\nwork-house child with Horsegrease? The true sons of science do not\r\nrush into print in such shameless deshabille.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX.--WILLIAM SUMMERS, aged five and a half.\r\n\r\nInoculated 16th March, 1798, from the nipple of one of the Cows\r\ninfected with Horsegrease by Haynes. Subsequently inoculated with\r\nSmallpox without effect.\r\n\r\n\r\nXX.--WILLIAM PEAD, aged eight.\r\n\r\nInoculated, 28th March, from Summers. Subsequently inoculated with\r\nSmallpox without effect.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI.--HANNAH EXCELL, aged seven.\r\n\r\nAnd several children and adults were inoculated from the arm of\r\nPead on 5th April. “The greater part of them sickened on the sixth\r\nday, and were well on the seventh; but in three of the number\r\na secondary indisposition arose in consequence of an extensive\r\nerysipelatous inflammation which appeared on the inoculated arms.\r\nBy the application of mercurial ointment to the inflamed parts (a\r\ntreatment recommended under similar circumstances in the inoculated\r\nSmallpox) the complaint subsided without giving much trouble.”\r\n\r\nExcell was inoculated in three places on her arm. “This,” said\r\nJenner, “was not done intentionally, but from the accidental\r\ntouch of the lancet, _one puncture being always sufficient_.” The\r\nresulting pustules so much resembled those arising from inoculation\r\nwith Smallpox, “that an experienced inoculator would scarcely have\r\ndiscovered a shade of difference.”\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII.--FOUR CHILDREN.\r\n\r\nOn 12th April virus was taken from Hannah Excell and inserted in\r\nthe arms of--\r\n\r\n    Robert F. Jenner, aged 11 months,\r\n    John Marklove,     ”   18   ”\r\n    Mary Pead,         ”    5 years,\r\n    Mary James,        ”    6   ”\r\n\r\nR. F. Jenner did not “take.” The arms of the others inflamed, and\r\nJenner fearing erysipelas, as in the preceding cases, applied a\r\ncaustic of soap and quick-lime to Marklove and James, “which,” he\r\nsays, “effectually answered my intention in preventing erysipelas.”\r\nThe disease was suffered to take its course in Pead, and no\r\nerysipelas appeared.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII.--JOHN BARGE, aged seven.\r\n\r\nInoculated from Mary Pead, and successfully. Was subsequently\r\ninoculated with Smallpox without effect.\r\n\r\n“These experiments,” said Jenner, “afforded me much satisfaction;\r\nthey proved that the matter in passing from one human subject\r\nto another, through five gradations, lost none of its original\r\nproperties, John Barge being the fifth who received the infection\r\nsuccessively from Wm. Summers, the boy to whom it was communicated\r\nfrom the Cow.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThese are Jenner’s Cases. In them we have his “Masterpiece of\r\nMedical Induction”--the fruit of thirty years of incessant thought,\r\nof watching, and of experiment! Let us carefully observe the\r\ndates. Until 1796, when he operated on Phipps, he never made an\r\nexperiment in Horsegrease Cowpox Inoculation; and not until the\r\nmiddle of March, 1798, a few weeks before going to press with the\r\n_Inquiry_, did he repeat the experiment; and though his later\r\ncases were complicated with erysipelas, he did not stay to dispose\r\nof the difficulty and alarm thereby excited. He got together his\r\nscratch lot of Cases, as if under some over-mastering compulsion,\r\nand consigned the concern, crude and incomplete, to the public.\r\nBy-and-by the hasty performance came to be spoken of as the result\r\nof thirty years of incessant thought, of patient research, and of\r\nunwearied labour. It is unnecessary to argue the matter. Whilst\r\nthere is nothing too great for the credulity of those who are in\r\nthe disposition of belief, yet facts are facts, and there is the\r\nstone-wall of the _Inquiry_ with its authentic details whereon to\r\ncrack the skulls of romancers. In Jenner’s story as recited to the\r\nvulgar, we have the advantage of witnessing the development of\r\nmyth in the light of our own age under our own eyes.\r\n\r\nTaking Jenner’s _Inquiry_ at the utmost, What was it? A suggestion\r\nto substitute Horsegrease Cowpox for Smallpox in inoculation.\r\nThat was all. Beyond this there was no point of novelty. Some\r\nhave credited Jenner with originating the transfer of virus from\r\narm to arm; but in this respect he followed the example of many\r\nvariolators. There was a mild form of Smallpox occasionally\r\nprevalent in London called “pearly pox,” and Dr. Adams and others\r\nkept it going from patient to patient; and the virus from the body\r\nof a healthy variolated child was in constant request by timid\r\nfolk, who fancied the virulence of the original infection might\r\nthereby be abated in transmission.\r\n\r\nSo much for Jenner’s data. Now for a word or two as to the\r\nspeculation that invested his prescription.\r\n\r\nHe considered that some of the diseases which afflict men are\r\nderived from their domestication of animals, and that thus several\r\ndiseases might have a common origin. “For example,” he asked, “Is\r\nit difficult to imagine that measles, scarlet fever, and ulcerous\r\nsore throat with a spotted skin, have all sprung from the same\r\nsource?”\r\n\r\nAbout the imagination, there might be little difficulty: the\r\ndifficulty lay in the production of proof that any disease in man\r\nwas derived from disease in animals, and that disease so derived\r\nwas variously manifested. Jenner wished to have it believed that\r\na variety of Cowpox was generated from Horsegrease, which Cowpox\r\nwas the source of Smallpox. He adduced no evidence, however, to\r\nconnect outbreaks of Smallpox with Cowpox; nor did he ever suggest\r\nthat dairymaids caught Smallpox from Cows, or farriers from\r\nHorses. His identification of Horsegrease Cowpox with Smallpox\r\nwas the resemblance of their pustules, and on the ground of this\r\nresemblance he affirmed the equivalence of the diseases. Thus in\r\ndescribing his first inoculation of Cowpox, that of Phipps from the\r\nhand of Sarah Nelmes on the 14th of May, 1796, he wrote--\r\n\r\n  The appearance of the incisions in their progress to a state of\r\n  maturation was much the same as when produced in a similar manner\r\n  by variolous matter. This appearance was in a great measure\r\n  new to me, and I ever shall recollect the pleasing sensations\r\n  it excited; as, from its similarity to the pustule produced by\r\n  variolous inoculation, it incontestably pointed out the close\r\n  connection between the two diseases, and almost anticipated the\r\n  result of my future experiments. (P. 30.)\r\n\r\nThe similarity of the Cowpox and Smallpox pustules _incontestably\r\npointed out_ the close connection between the two diseases!\r\nThe observation and the conclusion are worth notice, being\r\ncharacteristic of Jenner’s loose and illogical mind. He was\r\nfamiliar with Tartar Emetic, and he might have observed that it\r\nproduced pustules on the skin exactly like those of Cowpox and\r\nSmallpox; wherefore would it have been fair to argue that the\r\npustules being alike, their causes were incontestably identical?\r\nDr. Hamernik of Prague observes--\r\n\r\n  Some years ago the theory was brought forward, under the auspices\r\n  of the great alchemistical artist, Hufeland, that Vaccination\r\n  from Tartar Emetic pustules was a perfect substitute for\r\n  Vaccination with Cowpox, and had the same beneficent effect.\r\n  With this I fully agree; and I remark further, that if Tartar\r\n  Emetic pustulation is produced in Cows and Calves, and vaccine\r\n  matter is then taken from them, such Vaccination is also\r\n  perfectly harmless. The most convincing proof of the beneficent\r\n  and identical action of such Vaccination with that of Cowpox, is\r\n  furnished by the fact that it presents pustules similar in size\r\n  and form, therefore, necessarily of identical value.[99]\r\n\r\nHaving identified Horsegrease Cowpox with Smallpox, by reason of\r\nsimilarity of pustules, he went on to assert that such Horsegrease\r\nCowpox was equivalent to Smallpox for inoculation, and was attended\r\nwith the like prophylaxy, saying--\r\n\r\n  What renders the Cowpox virus so extremely singular is, that\r\n  the person affected with it is forever after secure from the\r\n  infection of the Smallpox; neither exposure to the variolous\r\n  effluvia, nor the insertion of the matter into the skin producing\r\n  this distemper. (P. 7.)\r\n\r\n  It is curious also to observe, that the virus, which, with\r\n  respect to its effects, is undetermined and uncertain previously\r\n  to its passing from the Horse through the medium of the Cow,\r\n  should then not only become more active, but should invariably\r\n  and completely possess those specific properties which induce in\r\n  the human constitution symptoms similar to those of the variolous\r\n  fever, and effect in it that peculiar change _which for ever_\r\n  renders it insusceptible of the variolous contagion. (P. 48.)\r\n\r\nAnd so on. The assurance was absolute, and the warrant for the\r\nassurance was the Cases adduced, and the similarity of Horsegrease\r\nCowpox pustules and Cowpox pustules! But if the pustules were\r\nsimilar, the effects were not similar. Inoculation with Smallpox\r\nproduced Smallpox, mild or otherwise, with pustules few or many;\r\nbut inoculation with Horsegrease Cowpox was attended with no\r\neruption beyond the points of incision--\r\n\r\n  It is an excess in the number of pustules which we chiefly dread\r\n  in the Smallpox; but in the Cowpox no pustules appear, nor does\r\n  it seem possible for the contagious matter to produce the disease\r\n  from effluvia; so that a single individual in a family might at\r\n  any time receive it without the risk of infecting the rest, or of\r\n  spreading a distemper that fills a country with terror. (P. 58.)\r\n\r\nVery good; but where are we? If similarity of pustule proved the\r\nidentity of Smallpox and Horsegrease Cowpox, what did those graver\r\ndissimilarities between the diseases prove? That an objection so\r\nobvious should never have occurred to Jenner indicates the extent\r\nof his logical capacity.\r\n\r\nJenner’s expectation from the issue of the _Inquiry_ had nothing of\r\nthe prophetic character described by his enthusiastic biographers.\r\nIt is only necessary to peruse its pages and note the dates in\r\norder to perceive the impossibility of the vision of 1780 described\r\nby Baron when Jenner exhibited to Gardner his future glory, and how\r\nhe was destined to stand like Aaron between the living and the dead\r\nuntil the plague was stayed. Alas! how many similar fables may we\r\nentertain because the means of detection are not, as in Jenner’s\r\ncase, available.\r\n\r\nWhen Jenner was writing, the English people were committed to\r\nSmallpox Inoculation, or more accurately Smallpox culture, and it\r\nwas in competition with Smallpox that he advanced Cowpox. “If\r\nasked,” he said, “whether his investigation be matter of mere\r\ncuriosity, or whether it tend to any beneficial purpose,” he\r\nreplied by setting forth the draw-backs to the existing practice,\r\nand contrasting them with the advantages of his own.\r\n\r\n  Notwithstanding [he wrote] the happy effects of Inoculation, with\r\n  all the improvements the practice has received since its first\r\n  introduction into this country, it not very unfrequently produces\r\n  deformity of the skin, and sometimes, under the best management,\r\n  proves fatal. (P. 57.)\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, he said--\r\n\r\n  I have never known fatal effects arise from the Cowpox, even when\r\n  impressed in the most unfavourable manner, producing extensive\r\n  inflammations and suppurations on the hands; and as it clearly\r\n  appears that this disease leaves the constitution in a state of\r\n  perfect security from the infection of the Smallpox, may we not\r\n  infer that a mode of Inoculation may be introduced preferable to\r\n  that at present adopted, especially among those families, which,\r\n  from previous circumstances, we may judge to be predisposed to\r\n  have the disease unfavourably?\r\n\r\nInoculation was freely charged with exciting scrofula; thus Jenner\r\nobserved--\r\n\r\n  In constitutions predisposed to scrofula, how frequently we see\r\n  the inoculated Smallpox rouse into activity that distressful\r\n  malady; and the issue does not seem to depend on the manner of\r\n  the inoculation, for it as often occurs in those who receive it\r\n  mildly as in those who receive it severely. (P. 60.)\r\n\r\nHappily he had the grace to refrain from the explicit assertion\r\nthat Cowpox was exempt from similar hazard; yet with characteristic\r\ninconsistency, was disposed to advance a claim for it as an\r\nexpulsive irritant--\r\n\r\n  As we have seen [though he never showed] that the constitution\r\n  may at any time be made to feel the febrile attack of Cowpox,\r\n  might it not, in many chronic diseases, be introduced into the\r\n  system, with the probability of affording relief, upon well-known\r\n  physiological principles? (P. 60.)\r\n\r\nA reader of the _Inquiry_ in 1798 could never have supposed that it\r\nwas an attempt to displace the existing practice of Inoculation.\r\nNor is there any sign that Jenner at the time contemplated such\r\nan issue. He referred to Variolous Inoculation with respect, and\r\nwas satisfied to suggest that in certain cases inoculation with\r\nHorsegrease Cowpox might be substituted with advantage. As to the\r\npermanent existence of Horsegrease Cowpox he was doubtful. Since,\r\nhe said, the farmers had traced the infection to the Horse, “the\r\nappearance of the Cowpox may either be entirely extinguished or\r\nbecome extremely rare.” It may be replied that this behaviour on\r\nthe part of Jenner was due to reserve and tact, but the reserve and\r\ntact are invisible. The _Inquiry_ was simply what it appears--a\r\nhasty performance, which, in other hands, developed to more,\r\nfar more, than its author contemplated. Subsequently he, and\r\nhis friends for him, laid claim to years of research under the\r\ninfluence of supernatural foresight; but, with the _Inquiry_ before\r\nus, I ask where is the evidence? I take the date, 14th May, 1796,\r\nwhen Jenner inoculated Phipps from the hand of Sarah Nelmes, as the\r\ntime when the project of inoculation with Horsegrease Cowpox began\r\nto assume form, and I maintain that the character, order and dates\r\nof the Cases set forth in the _Inquiry_ plainly show that they were\r\ngot together to sustain the conclusion then arrived at. When Mr.\r\nJohn Simon descants on Jenner’s thirty years of incessant thought,\r\nwatching and experimenting which resulted in the production of\r\nthat Masterpiece of Medical Induction--_The Inquiry_, the answer\r\nis, Peruse the _Inquiry_, and then say where the fruit of thirty\r\nyears of labour is to be found. The assertion is too absurd for\r\ndiscussion, whatever it may be as an article of faith.\r\n\r\nThe single point of originality in the _Inquiry_ was the definition\r\nof the disease for which prophylactic efficacy was asserted. The\r\ndairymaids said Cowpox: the farriers said Horsegrease. Jenner\r\nsaid neither Cowpox nor Horsegrease, but their combination in\r\nHorsegrease Cowpox, which variety of Pox alone ensured life-long\r\nsecurity from Smallpox. We shall see as we proceed how this\r\nposition was surrendered and resumed, modified and confused beyond\r\nrecognition. Let it suffice at present to say that the note of\r\nJenner’s _Inquiry_ was HORSEGREASE COWPOX and nothing else. Strike\r\nout HORSEGREASE COWPOX, and the affair is reduced to nonentity.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VARIOLOUS TEST.\r\n\r\nWhat was called the Variolous Test worked wonderfully for Jenner;\r\nand as we shall have to refer to it repeatedly, it may be well to\r\ndescribe and dispose of it at once.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how the Test was practised in the Cases in the\r\n_Inquiry_. Those who had undergone Cowpox were inoculated with\r\nSmallpox, and as the Smallpox did not “take,” they were assumed\r\nto be proof against that disease. Hence the absolute conclusion\r\nproclaimed _Urbi et Orbi_, that none inoculated with Cowpox could\r\never afterwards contract Smallpox.\r\n\r\nIt was replied, that some who _had_ suffered from Cowpox _had_\r\ncontracted Smallpox, and that others _had_ received the disease by\r\ninoculation; to which Jenner’s summary answer was, “There must have\r\nbeen some mistake about the Cowpox; for no one _can_ have genuine\r\nCowpox and subsequently incur Smallpox, either by infection or\r\ninoculation.”\r\n\r\nCowpox was inoculated and propagated from arm to arm; and, in proof\r\nthat the constitution was fortified against Smallpox, it was common\r\nto inoculate with Smallpox, which usually did not “take”; whereon\r\nthe operator exclaimed, “Behold! the patient is insusceptible of\r\nSmallpox _for ever_!”\r\n\r\nSuch was the Variolous Test. It was to multitudes absolutely\r\nconclusive; and to question its validity was to exhibit a\r\ncontentious and unphilosophic disposition.\r\n\r\nWhat shall we now say concerning it?\r\n\r\nFirst, that failures were numerous in Variolous Inoculation apart\r\nfrom Vaccination, and that it was not supposed that when a patient\r\ndid not “take,” he was therefore insusceptible of Smallpox; nor\r\neven when he did “take,” that he was thereby rendered proof against\r\nSmallpox. So many of the successfully inoculated did subsequently\r\nfall victims to Smallpox, that Variolators at the end of last\r\ncentury were compelled to argue (like Vaccinators at the end of\r\nthis) that Variolation was a guard, but not an absolute guard;\r\nand that when it did not altogether avert Smallpox, it modified\r\nand mitigated an attack. The excuse for failure was as artful as\r\nthe motive was urgent: Variolation was too good a trade to be\r\nimperilled for lack of a little ingenuity.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, if we make full allowance on the score of frequent\r\nincapacity to receive Variolation, we have yet to explain, on a\r\ncandid view of the whole evidence, how it was that in numerous\r\ncases Inoculation with Smallpox was ineffective after Inoculation\r\nwith Cowpox.\r\n\r\n“What can you urge against the Variolous Test?” was a frequent and\r\nimperious demand.\r\n\r\nThe explanation in general lay in the fact, that Variolation was\r\nattempted before the complete subsidence of the vaccine fever.\r\nThe inoculation with Cowpox had set up a serious constitutional\r\ndisturbance, and during that disturbance the Smallpox virus could\r\nnot develop its malign energy. Let me show what I mean from the\r\ntestimony of Jenner himself.\r\n\r\nOn 15th March, 1800, the Duke of York requested Jenner to proceed\r\nto Colchester to the 85th Regiment. Jenner was unable to go, and\r\nsent his nephew, George, instead, who had to report a complete\r\nfailure. The reason of the failure was, that the entire Regiment,\r\nwith women and children, had the itch! Jenner was then driven\r\nto the conclusion which, says Baron, “he adopted and invariably\r\nmaintained to the last hour of his life, namely, that any cutaneous\r\ndisease, however slight in appearance, was capable of interfering\r\nwith the regular course of the Cowpox and of preventing it from\r\nexercising its full protecting influence.”[100]\r\n\r\nJust so: and mark how the same logic applies to the Variolous Test,\r\nwhich “nobody could get over.” If any cutaneous disorder, however\r\nslight, could nullify Cowpox, was it not equally probable that\r\nthe cutaneous disorder induced by inoculated Cowpox would nullify\r\ninoculated Smallpox _until the effects of the Cowpox had time to\r\nsubside_? When the itch at Colchester was cured, then inoculation\r\nwith Cowpox was found to be practicable. Thus worthless was the\r\nVariolous Test on Jenner’s own principle; yet with such evidence\r\nunder his eyes and among his fingers, he failed to discern its\r\nsignificance. Nor apparently did he inquire whether the influence\r\nof Cowpox was perpetuated over specified periods of six months,\r\nnine months, one year, two years, and so on. As trader and\r\nadventurer, it suited him better to be not over inquisitive, and\r\nto avow boldly that his specific conferred life-long immunity from\r\nSmallpox.\r\n\r\nVaccinators at this day rarely refer to the once famous Variolous\r\nTest: to do so would be absurd. The fact of Re-Vaccination, of\r\nVaccination after Vaccination at short intervals, proves, that\r\nwhatever the influence of the operation, it is transient and not\r\npermanent; and the cases of Smallpox after Vaccination, and of\r\nSmallpox in its most malignant forms after Re-Vaccination, as\r\nif induced thereby, leave the Variolous Test, which so widely\r\nimpressed and imposed upon our forefathers, an exploded piece of\r\njugglery.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[98] Such timely remedies were solutions of sulphate of zinc or\r\nsulphate of copper--a hint for those in quest of antidotes for\r\nVaccination.\r\n\r\n[99] _Remarks on Certain Medical Principles._ London, 1882.\r\n\r\n[100] Baron’s _Life of Jenner_, vol. i. p. 380.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nJENNER IN 1798.\r\n\r\n\r\nJenner, with his wife and daughter, left Berkeley for London on\r\n24th April, 1798, in order to see the _Inquiry_ through the press.\r\nHe remained in London until 14th July, and failed, if he tried,\r\nto induce any inoculator to substitute cowpox for smallpox. In\r\nthe Jenner legend, it is usual to find some touching remarks on\r\nthis trip to town: genius unrecognised: truth turned from every\r\ndoor: the great soul abiding in patience and courage invincible.\r\nDates, however, are again merciless. The _Inquiry_ was not in the\r\nbooksellers’ hands until the end of June, and, within a fortnight\r\nafter publication, Jenner was on his way to Berkeley. There was no\r\noccasion for the virtues specified.\r\n\r\nAmong Jenner’s acquaintance was Henry Cline, teacher of surgery in\r\nSt. Thomas’s Hospital; and with Cline he left some virus in a quill\r\nthat he had taken from the arm of Hannah Excell, at Berkeley on 5th\r\nApril. Cline had a patient, a child named Richard Weller, with an\r\naffection of the hip-joint, and intending to create an issue by way\r\nof counter-irritation, he inoculated the hip with Excell’s virus,\r\nand thus described the experiment in a letter to Jenner--\r\n\r\n    LINCOLN’S INN FIELDS, _2nd August, 1798_.\r\n\r\n  The Cowpox experiment has succeeded admirably. The child sickened\r\n  on the seventh day; and the fever, which was moderate, subsided\r\n  on the eleventh day. The inflammation extended to about four\r\n  inches diameter, and then gradually subsided without having been\r\n  attended with pain or other inconvenience. The ulcer was not\r\n  large enough to contain a pea; therefore, I have not converted\r\n  it into an issue as I intended. I have since inoculated him with\r\n  smallpox in three places, which were slightly inflamed on the\r\n  third day, and then subsided.\r\n\r\n  Dr. Lister, who was formerly physician to the Smallpox Hospital,\r\n  attended the child with me, and he is convinced that it is not\r\n  possible to give him the smallpox.\r\n\r\n  I think the substituting of cowpox poison for the smallpox\r\n  promises to be one of the greatest improvements that has ever\r\n  been made in medicine; for it is not only so safe in itself, but\r\n  also does not endanger others by contagion, in which way the\r\n  smallpox has done infinite mischief. The more I think on the\r\n  subject, the more I am impressed with its importance.\r\n\r\nCline then attempted to vaccinate with virus taken from Weller’s\r\nhip, but failed. He wrote to Jenner--\r\n\r\n    LINCOLN’S INN FIELDS, _18th August, 1798_.\r\n\r\n  Seven days since I inoculated three children with cowpox matter,\r\n  and I have the mortification of finding that the infection has\r\n  not taken, and I fear I shall be entirely disappointed unless you\r\n  can contrive to send me some fresh matter. I think it might come\r\n  in a quill in a letter, or enclosed in a bit of tin-foil.\r\n\r\nJenner was unable to comply with Cline’s request: he had no cowpox\r\nto transmit: and readers of the _Inquiry_ who addressed to him\r\nsimilar requests had to submit to similar disappointments, out of\r\nwhich some suspicion was naturally developed. The recommendation of\r\na remedy whereof there was no available supply was not a passport\r\nto confidence.\r\n\r\nBaron relates, that “Mr. Cline perceiving _at once_ from the\r\nsuccess of his first trial, what incalculable blessings were\r\nconnected with the diffusion of the new practice, immediately\r\nadvised Jenner to quit the country, and to take a house in\r\nGrosvenor Square, and promised him £10,000 per annum as the result\r\nof his practice; in which opinion Mr. Cline was supported by Sir\r\nW. Farquhar; but that all these splendid prospects of wealth and\r\ndistinction could not move Jenner.”[101]\r\n\r\nThe story is either an invention, or it does little credit to\r\nCline’s judgment. Jenner had neither the means for a house in\r\nGrosvenor Square, nor was there any likelihood of his earning\r\n£10,000 a year by cowpox. Nevertheless it would appear that at this\r\njuncture some one was advising him to try London (one’s vanity is\r\nnever without a prompter), and that Jenner replied--\r\n\r\n    CHELTENHAM, _29th September_.\r\n\r\n  My perplexity really amounts to agitation. On the one hand,\r\n  unwilling to come to town myself for the sake of practice, and,\r\n  on the other, fearful that the practice I have recommended may\r\n  fall into the hands of those who are incapable of conducting it,\r\n  I am thrown into a state that was not at first perceptible as\r\n  likely to happen to me; for, believe me, I am not callous to all\r\n  the feelings of those wounds which, from misrepresentation, might\r\n  fall on my reputation; on the contrary, no nerves could feel more\r\n  acutely; and they now are actually in a tremor from anticipation.\r\n\r\n  How very few are capable of conducting physiological experiments!\r\n  I am fearful that before we thoroughly understand what is cowpox\r\n  matter, and what is not, some confusion may arise, for which I\r\n  shall, unjustly, be made answerable.[102]\r\n\r\nIf his correspondent had been a man of sense, he might have\r\nreplied--\r\n\r\n  Why so much ado about nothing! You recommend that horsegrease\r\n  cowpox be substituted for smallpox in cases of inoculation. It is\r\n  a simple prescription, easily determined altogether apart from\r\n  you, and there is no reason why you should work yourself into\r\n  such a flutter.\r\n\r\nBut Jenner was not the unimpassioned man of science, who can leave\r\ntruth to take care of itself, and submit when truth contradicts his\r\nprepossessions. Dr. Ingenhousz, an Anglicised Dutchman (born at\r\nBreda, 1730), with reputation as electrician and chemist, read the\r\n_Inquiry_ with considerable amazement. He was himself an inoculator\r\nof mark, having been selected by the Empress Maria Teresa to\r\noperate upon the imperial family of Austria; and by her had been\r\nrewarded (after the pattern of Catharine of Russia and Dimsdale)\r\nwith a pension of £600 a year, and the titles of Aulic Councillor\r\nand Imperial Physician. Naturally, therefore, Ingenhousz had a\r\nlively interest in Jenner’s project, and being on a visit to the\r\nMarquis of Lansdowne at his seat in Wiltshire, addressed him as\r\nfollows--\r\n\r\n    BOWOOD PARK, _12th October, 1798_.\r\n\r\n  As soon as I arrived at Bowood, I thought it my duty to inquire\r\n  concerning the extraordinary doctrines contained in your\r\n  publication, as I knew the cowpox was well known in this county.\r\n\r\n  The first gentleman to whom I addressed myself was Mr. Alsop,\r\n  an eminent practitioner at Calne, who made me acquainted with\r\n  Mr. Henry Stiles, a respectable farmer at Whitley, who, thirty\r\n  years ago, bought a cow at a fair, which he found to be infected\r\n  with what he called the cowpox. This cow soon infected the whole\r\n  dairy; and he himself, by milking the infected cow, caught the\r\n  disease which you describe, and that in a very severe way,\r\n  accompanied with pain, stiffness, and swelling of the axillary\r\n  glands. Having recovered from the disease, and all the sores\r\n  dried, he was inoculated with smallpox by Mr. Alsop. The disease\r\n  took place, a great many pox came out, and he communicated the\r\n  infection to his father who died of it.\r\n\r\n  This being an incontrovertible fact, cannot fail to make some\r\n  impression on your mind, and excite you to inquire further on\r\n  the subject before you venture finally to decide in favour of a\r\n  doctrine, which may do great mischief should it prove erroneous.\r\n\r\nThe impression made on Jenner’s mind was simply one of annoyance.\r\nHe fell back on the assertion that all was not cowpox that was\r\nsupposed to be cowpox, and that Farmer Stiles could not have had\r\nthe genuine distemper, or he would not have received smallpox by\r\ninoculation. It did not even occur to him that it was necessary to\r\ninvestigate and account for the evidence adduced by Ingenhousz,\r\nwhich was every whit as valid as much of his own. He was content to\r\nprotest--\r\n\r\n  In the course of my inquiry, not a single instance occurred of\r\n  any one having the disease, either casually or from inoculation,\r\n  who on subsequent exposure to variolous contagion received\r\n  the infection of smallpox.... Should it appear in the present\r\n  instance that I have been led into error, fond as I may appear\r\n  of the offspring of my labours, I had rather strangle it at once\r\n  than suffer it to exist, and do a public injury. At present, I\r\n  have not the most distant doubt that any person, who has once\r\n  felt the influence of perfect cowpox matter, would ever be\r\n  susceptible of that of the smallpox.\r\n\r\nCould universal conclusion be deduced from more questionable\r\npremisses? and this, too, by one who had just exclaimed, “How\r\nvery few are capable of conducting physiological experiments!”\r\nAlways, as we shall see; ungenerous toward those who questioned his\r\nassertions, Jenner wrote to his friend, Gardner--\r\n\r\n  This man, Ingenhousz, knows no more of the real nature of\r\n  the cowpox than Master Selwyn does of Greek: yet he is among\r\n  philosophers what Johnson was among the literati, and, by the\r\n  way, not unlike him in figure--\r\n\r\nWhen, in fact, what provoked him was that Ingenhousz knew too\r\nmuch about cowpox, and had laid his finger on the point of error\r\nat the outset. Inquiry on the part of Ingenhousz brought to light\r\nseveral other instances of smallpox after cowpox; and Dr. Pulteney\r\nof Blandford reported that Dorsetshire inoculators were familiar\r\nwith the one sort of pox after the other sort. Jenner’s constant\r\nanswer to such objections was, “Yes; but it could not have been\r\ntrue cowpox to start with”--a style of argument maintained with\r\nparrot-like persistency when smallpox followed vaccination.\r\n“Ah!” it was said, “there must have been some mistake about the\r\nvaccination; for no one can be thoroughly vaccinated and have\r\nsmallpox.”\r\n\r\nLooking back on the final years of last century, it is much to be\r\nregretted that more pains were not taken to hold Jenner fast to his\r\nposition that smallpox never followed cowpox, and to demonstrate\r\nbeyond contention that it was not true. It certainly was not true;\r\nthe evidence to that fact was indisputable; but few were disposed\r\nto follow Ingenhousz into the West of England and search for the\r\nrequisite proof; and Ingenhousz was cut out of the controversy\r\nby his death at Bowood on 7th September, 1799. Presently Jenner\r\nmanaged to have the contention shifted from the experience of the\r\ndairies to vaccination from arm to arm and the illusory variolous\r\ntest, and the advantage of a decision at the springs of fallacy\r\nwas lost. In the general confusion which ensued Jenner came to be\r\ntaken for a discoverer, and he posed diligently in the character,\r\nwhen he was nothing more than the advertiser of the vulgar opinion\r\nof his neighbourhood, with the modification that not Cowpox but\r\nHorsegrease Cowpox was the true and infallible specific. The fact\r\nis so clear, that he was a mere advertiser, that it would not be\r\nworth repetition, were it not so systematically treated as unseen.\r\nHow distinctly it was at first recognised appears in a letter of\r\nthanks for a copy of the _Inquiry_ addressed to Jenner by Francis\r\nKnight, a London surgeon, wherein he observed--\r\n\r\n    CLIFFORD STREET, _10th September, 1798_.\r\n\r\n  I have read your publication with much satisfaction; and, from\r\n  a long residence in the dairy part of Wiltshire, as well as in\r\n  Gloucestershire, I know the facts to be well supported; at least,\r\n  it was a general opinion among the dairymen, that those who\r\n  had received the cowpox were not susceptible of the variolous\r\n  disease. The cowpox pustule is very familiar to my eye, and I am\r\n  quite charmed with the delineation of it in your plates. You have\r\n  opened to the world a very curious field of investigation, and it\r\n  is too interesting a subject to die with the day.[103]\r\n\r\nIn these remarks of Knight, we have Jenner’s position accurately\r\ndefined. He made himself responsible for “the general opinion among\r\nthe dairymen”; and had some one at that time shown in perspicuous\r\nand emphatic fashion that the dairymen were wrong, Jenner would\r\nhave been summarily disposed of. Vain, however, are such regrets;\r\nand we may find comfort in the reflection that there is an order in\r\nthe universe which converts misfortune into means for greater and\r\nrarer good.\r\n\r\nAnother letter to Jenner from Dr. Hicks contains these remarks--\r\n\r\n    BRISTOL, _3rd October, 1798_.\r\n\r\n  I wish you had been able to have communicated the cowpox to the\r\n  cow by means of inoculation from a greasy horse’s heel, for your\r\n  work would then have been more complete and satisfactory.\r\n\r\n  I do not see that you need hesitate to accept the invitation\r\n  given you to inoculate with the cowpox, convinced as you are that\r\n  it will secure the persons so inoculated from ever being infected\r\n  with the smallpox.\r\n\r\nEverlasting security from smallpox! Such was the unqualified\r\npromise, and with how little warrant! In presence of a Socratic\r\ninquirer with his persistent, how do you know? Jenner must have\r\nstood confounded.\r\n\r\nA letter to Jenner from Dr. Percival, also contains some remarks\r\nworth notice. He wrote--\r\n\r\n    MANCHESTER, _20th November, 1798_.\r\n\r\n  The facts you have adduced incontestably prove the existence of\r\n  the cowpox, and its ready communication to the human species.\r\n  But a larger induction is yet necessary to evince that the virus\r\n  of the Variolæ Vaccina renders the person who has been affected\r\n  with it secure during the whole of life from the infection of the\r\n  smallpox.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Simmons, an ingenious surgeon of this town, has inoculated\r\n  a human subject with the ichor issuing from what is termed\r\n  the grease in horses; but the fluid introduced, though eight\r\n  punctures were made, neither occasioned inflammation nor\r\n  eruption; yet the same child was soon afterwards inoculated with\r\n  success for the smallpox. Mr. Simmons has now engaged a herd of\r\n  cows, and is busily employed in making such experiments as your\r\n  publication has suggested.\r\n\r\n  It is very remarkable, that the cowpox has been hitherto\r\n  unnoticed in Cheshire, which is not less a dairy county than\r\n  Gloucestershire, and where the office of milking is performed\r\n  also by men and maid servants indiscriminately.\r\n\r\nThe frequent statement that Jenner’s _Inquiry_ was at first\r\nreceived with indifference is entirely untrue: on the contrary, it\r\nwas read with interest from the outset, and the only check he met\r\nwas due to his inability to supply the demands of correspondents\r\nfor samples of the precious virus. Cowpox was absent for awhile\r\nfrom the dairies, and great was his relief and delight when toward\r\nthe end of 1798 some matter was obtained from a farm at Stonehouse\r\nwherewith on the 27th November he vaccinated the children of his\r\nfriend, Henry Hicks of Eastington; “the first gentleman,” says\r\nBaron, “who had the merit of submitting his own children to the new\r\npractice.”\r\n\r\nEre 1798 had passed away, Jenner had secured an energetic ally in\r\nDr. George Pearson, F.R.S., Physician to St. George’s Hospital,\r\nLondon.[104] Pearson entered into the cowpox question with his\r\nwhole heart, and constituted himself a sort of partner in Jenner’s\r\nproject. He wrote to him--\r\n\r\n    LEICESTER SQUARE, _8th November, 1798_.\r\n\r\n  Your name will live in the memory of mankind, as long as men\r\n  possess gratitude for services and respect for benefactors; and\r\n  if I can but get matter, I am much mistaken if _I do make you\r\n  live for ever_.\r\n\r\nAnd in a more decided strain on 13th November--\r\n\r\n  I wish you could secure me matter for inoculation, because,\r\n  depend upon it, a thousand inacurate but imposing cases will be\r\n  published against the specific nature of the disease by persons\r\n  who want to send their names abroad about anything, and who will\r\n  think _you and me_ fair game.\r\n\r\nIn the same letter he told Jenner what some were saying about the\r\nsuggested practice--\r\n\r\n  You cannot imagine how fastidious the people are with regard to\r\n  this business of the cowpox. One says that it is very filthy and\r\n  nasty to derive it from the sore heels of horses. Another, that\r\n  we shall introduce the diseases of animals among us, and that we\r\n  have already too many of our own. A third sapient set say, it is\r\n  a strange odd kind of business, and they know not what to think\r\n  of it. All this I hear very quietly, and recollect that a still\r\n  more unfavourable reception was given to inoculation for the\r\n  smallpox.\r\n\r\nSuch observations were natural and to be expected. Jenner wrote\r\nto Gardner that “brick-bats and hostile weapons of every sort\r\nwere flying thick around him,” but they were chiefly imaginary.\r\nHis revelation was communicated to a ready world. It was no\r\nrevolutionary project, but a seductive modification of existing\r\npractice. Inoculation with smallpox was the order of the day\r\namong all respectable people. The operation was troublesome and\r\nuncertain, perilous to patients and to those in contact with them;\r\nand, when all was done, it afforded no unquestionable security\r\nagainst the disease it was designed to avert. To a community thus\r\nharassed and anxious, came Jenner with his prescription and his\r\npromise--Substitute cowpox for smallpox and you will escape from\r\nthis distress, danger, doubt. You will have a harmless fever\r\nwithout pustules and without risk of infection, and the security\r\nfrom smallpox will be absolute and perpetual. What wonder that in\r\nsuch circumstances Jenner’s message was heard gladly and accepted\r\nwith grateful enthusiasm. That he should have encountered some\r\nresistance was inevitable, for what change is ever effected\r\nwithout opposition and ominous prediction? But the change Jenner\r\nproposed was the slightest of changes with the largest prospects\r\nof advantage. Unless these conditions are borne in mind, we shall\r\nnever rightly understand the reception accorded by our forefathers\r\nto inoculation with cowpox.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[101] Baron’s _Life of Jenner_, vol. i. p. 154.\r\n\r\n[102] _Ibid._ p. 155.\r\n\r\n[103] Baron’s _Life of Jenner_, vol. i. p. 159.\r\n\r\n[104] Born at Rotherham, 1751.

As observed, Jenner’s _Inquiry_\r\nwas published at the end of June, 1798, and ere six months\r\nwere over, in November, 1798, appeared Pearson’s _Inquiry_, a\r\nmasterly review of Jenner’s; and not only a review, but a record\r\nof investigation, personal and by correspondence with country\r\nphysicians and farmers; the entire work displaying a capacity for\r\nbusiness to which Jenner was wholly unequal.\r\n\r\nCowpox did not come before Pearson as a novelty, nor Jenner in\r\nconnection therewith. He relates--\r\n\r\n  When I was in company with the late Mr. John Hunter, about\r\n  nine years ago, I heard him communicate the information he had\r\n  received from Dr. Jenner, that in Gloucestershire an infectious\r\n  disorder frequently prevailed among the milch cows, named the\r\n  Cowpox, in which there was an eruption on their teats; that those\r\n  who milked such cows were liable to be affected with pustulous\r\n  eruptions on their hands, which were also called the cowpox; that\r\n  such persons as had undergone this DISEASE COULD NOT BE INFECTED\r\n  BY THE VARIOLOUS POISON; and that as no patient had been known to\r\n  die of the Cowpox, the practice of the inoculation of the poison\r\n  of this disease, to supersede the Smallpox, might be found, on\r\n  experience, to be a great improvement in physic.\r\n\r\n  I noted these observations, and constantly related them, when on\r\n  the subject of Smallpox, in every course of lectures which I have\r\n  given since that time. (P. 5.)\r\n\r\nThe communication of Jenner to Hunter was nothing of a discovery.\r\nThere was no secret in the existence of Cowpox, nor in the belief\r\nthat inoculation therewith fortified the sufferer against Smallpox.\r\nDr. Pulteney, of Blandford, informed Pearson that--\r\n\r\n  Cowpox is well known in Hampshire, Dorsetshire, Somersetshire,\r\n  and Devonshire. It is not unknown in Leicestershire, and other\r\n  midland counties; but dairymen keep it a secret as much as\r\n  possible, as it is disreputable to the cleanliness of their\r\n  produce. (P. 8.)\r\n\r\nIn the northern counties and in Wales, Cowpox was either rarely\r\nseen or unknown. In Cheshire, as much of a dairy county as\r\nGloucestershire, where also men acted as milkers, the disease\r\nwas never met with. Where, however, Cowpox was recognised, the\r\nfaith in its efficacy against Smallpox appeared to be general,\r\nand inoculators regarded it as a bar to their success. Thus Mr.\r\nGiffard, surgeon, Gillingham, wrote to Pearson, 9th August, 1798--\r\n\r\n  Cowpox is more known in Dorsetshire than in most counties. Last\r\n  winter I inoculated three parishes, and some of the subjects\r\n  told me they had had the Cowpox, and that they should not take\r\n  the Smallpox; but I desired to inoculate them, and did so two or\r\n  three times, but without effect. Persons never take the Smallpox\r\n  after they have had the Cowpox. (P. 14.)\r\n\r\nAt a milk-farm on the Hampstead Road, Pearson found a man who had\r\noften seen Cowpox in Wiltshire and Gloucestershire. He said that--\r\n\r\n  He had known many who had had Cowpox, and they never suffered\r\n  from the Smallpox, although it prevailed in their own families.\r\n  To use his own words, they who have had the Cowpox “are hard to\r\n  take the Smallpox.” (P. 29.)\r\n\r\nMr. Rolph, surgeon, Peckham, who had practised in Gloucestershire,\r\ninformed Pearson that--\r\n\r\n  Cowpox was very frequently epizootic in the dairy-farms in the\r\n  spring.... A great number of instances of the Cowpox in milkers\r\n  had fallen under his observation, but not a single mortal, or\r\n  even dangerous, case occurred. There was not a medical man in\r\n  Gloucestershire, or scarce a dairy-farmer, who did not know\r\n  from his own experience, or that of others, that those who have\r\n  suffered the Cowpox are exempt from the agency of the variolous\r\n  poison. (P. 95.)\r\n\r\nDr. Croft likewise told Pearson--\r\n\r\n  That in Staffordshire to his knowledge, the fact had been long\r\n  known of the Cowpox, which prevails in that county, affording an\r\n  exemption of the human subjects from the Smallpox. (P. 35.)\r\n\r\nNor did what was so widely believed escape mention in medical\r\nliterature. Thus Dr. Beddoes, in _Queries concerning Inoculation_,\r\nhad written in 1795--\r\n\r\n  I have learnt from my own observation, and the testimony of\r\n  some old practitioners, that susceptibility to the Smallpox is\r\n  destroyed by the Cowpox, which is a malady more unpleasant than\r\n  dangerous.\r\n\r\nAnd Dr. Adams, in his treatise on _Morbid Poisons_, 1795, observed--\r\n\r\n  Cowpox is a disease well known to the dairy-farmers in\r\n  Gloucestershire. What is extraordinary, as far as facts have\r\n  hitherto been ascertained, a person infected with Cowpox is\r\n  rendered insensible to the variolous poison.\r\n\r\nAnd Dr. Woodville in his _History of Inoculation_, 1796, argued--\r\n\r\n  It has been conjectured that the Smallpox might have been derived\r\n  from some disease of brute animals; and, if it be true that\r\n  the mange affecting dogs, can communicate a species of itch to\r\n  man; or that a person, having received a certain disorder from\r\n  handling the teats of cows, is thereby rendered insensible to\r\n  variolous infection ever afterwards--then, indeed, the conjecture\r\n  is not improbable.\r\n\r\nThe belief, moreover, that Cowpox was good against Smallpox, had\r\ntempted several to court the disease. The Rev. Herman Drewe wrote\r\nto Pearson of himself and Mr. Bragge, surgeon, Axminster, 5th July,\r\n1798--\r\n\r\n  Mr. Bragge and I endeavoured to try the experiment of inoculating\r\n  with the matter of the Cowpox, but from the scarceness of the\r\n  disease, and unwillingness of patients, we were disappointed. (P.\r\n  39.)\r\n\r\nMr. Dolling of Blandford related that--\r\n\r\n  Mr. Justings, of Axminster, inoculated his wife and children\r\n  with matter taken from the teats of a cow that had the Cowpox.\r\n  In about a week afterwards their arms were very much inflamed,\r\n  and the patients were so ill that the medical assistance of Mr.\r\n  Meach, of Cerne, was called for. The patients did well. They were\r\n  afterwards inoculated for the Smallpox by Mr. Trobridge without\r\n  effect. (P. 42.)\r\n\r\nDr. Pulteney of Blandford informed Pearson that--\r\n\r\n  A respectable practitioner inoculated seven children for the\r\n  Smallpox, five of whom had been purposely infected with the\r\n  Cowpox by being made to handle the teats and udders of cows\r\n  under the disease, and in consequence contracted the distemper.\r\n  These five, after inoculation for the Smallpox, did not sicken,\r\n  whilst the other two did. (P. 39.)\r\n\r\nThese cases were examples of many; and if it be asked, why were not\r\nsuch inoculations repeated, we may take an answer from Mr. Fewster,\r\nsurgeon, of Thornbury, who, in a practice of thirty years in\r\nGloucestershire, inoculated thousands with Smallpox, and had known\r\n“numberless instances of Cowpox.” He wrote, 11th October, 1798--\r\n\r\n  In general, I think, Cowpox is a much more severe disease than\r\n  the inoculated Smallpox; nor do I see any great advantage from\r\n  its inoculation. Smallpox inoculation seems to be so well\r\n  understood that there is very little need of a substitute. It is\r\n  curious, however, and may lead to other improvements. (P. 104.)\r\n\r\nTo show still further how Jenner’s communication was “in the\r\nair” ready for descent. Mr. Downe, surgeon of Bridport, wrote to\r\nPearson, 1st August, 1798--\r\n\r\n  A few years ago when I inoculated a great number for the\r\n  Smallpox, I remarked that I could not by any means infect one\r\n  or two of them; and, on inquiry, I was informed that they had\r\n  previously been infected with the Cowpox. I know that a medical\r\n  man in this part of the country was injured in his practice by\r\n  a prejudice raised unjustly that _he intended to substitute the\r\n  Cowpox for the Smallpox in inoculation_. So great an enemy to\r\n  improvement are the prejudices of the public in the country, that\r\n  I think experiments of importance can only be made in hospitals.\r\n  (P. 10.)\r\n\r\nThus popular scandal anticipated what was called Jenner’s discovery!\r\n\r\nNor was Pearson content simply to inquire of others: he\r\nexperimented himself, and put Cowpox to the test a week or so\r\nbefore the appearance of Jenner’s _Inquiry_. He wrote--\r\n\r\n  Happening, on the 14th of June, to be with Mr. Lucas, apothecary,\r\n  on professional business at Mr. Willan’s farm, adjoining the New\r\n  Road, Marylebone, where from 800 to 1000 milch cows are kept, I\r\n  availed myself of the opportunity to make inquiry concerning the\r\n  Cowpox. I was told it was a pretty frequent disease among the\r\n  cows of that farm, especially in winter, and that it was supposed\r\n  to arise from sudden change from poor to rich food. It was also\r\n  well known to the servants, some of whom had been affected with\r\n  the malady from milking the diseased cows. On investigation, I\r\n  found that three of the men-servants, namely, Thomas Edinburgh,\r\n  Thomas Grimshaw, and John Clarke had been affected with the\r\n  Cowpox, but not with the Smallpox. I induced them to be\r\n  inoculated for the Smallpox, and, with the view of ascertaining\r\n  the efficacy of the variolous infection employed, William Kent\r\n  and Thomas East, neither of whom had either the Cowpox or the\r\n  Smallpox, were also inoculated. (P. 14.)\r\n\r\nThe result conformed to expectation: Edinburgh, Grimshaw, and\r\nClarke did not take Smallpox, even though inoculation was repeated,\r\nwhilst Kent and East did. Pearson set forth his experiments much\r\nmore philosophically than Jenner, but his bias was pronounced, and\r\nit blinded him to some obvious considerations; and it is marvellous\r\nhow easily we may accumulate details for which we have a fancy.\r\nSumming up the testimonies he had collected, he held that--\r\n\r\n  The body of evidence is numerous and respectable, declaring\r\n  that a person who has laboured under the Cowpox fever and local\r\n  eruption, is not susceptible of the Smallpox. It does not appear\r\n  that a single well authenticated contravening instance has fallen\r\n  under observation. But I do not apprehend that accurate and able\r\n  reasoners will consider the fact as completely established,\r\n  though, I doubt not, they will allow that the testimonies now\r\n  produced greatly confirm the probability, and that the cautious\r\n  appropriation of it in practice is warrantable. (P. 64.)\r\n\r\nIn this summary we perceive the limit and imperfection of Pearson’s\r\n_Inquiry_. Smallpox _did_ follow Cowpox: it was well known that\r\nit did: and Dr. Ingenhousz ascertained the fact as soon as he\r\nlooked for it. Moreover Pearson showed himself ignorant of Jenner’s\r\nposition, who, recognising the fallacy of the rural superstition,\r\nwas compelled to discriminate Cowpox as genuine and spurious--the\r\ngenuine being the variety derived from Horsegrease.\r\n\r\nUpon Jenner’s assertion that Cowpox was unaltered by transmission\r\nfrom arm to arm, Pearson remarked, “The fact remained to be\r\nproved.” That Cowpox produced a harmless ailment was not, he\r\nthought, to be hastily assumed. Dr. William Heberden had recently\r\ninoculated 800 poor persons at Hungerford without a mishap, and\r\n1700 had passed through Dr. Woodville’s hands in the current\r\nyear (1798) with only two deaths; yet how erroneous would be to\r\nargue that variolous inoculation was harmless from such special\r\nexperience!\r\n\r\n  Such instances of success can only be attributed to a certain\r\n  favourable epidemic state of the human constitution itself,\r\n  existing at particular times, for the proportion of deaths from\r\n  inoculation is usually much greater, owing, probably, to certain\r\n  unfavourable epidemic states. (P. 67.)\r\n\r\nIf Cowpox remained unchanged in transmission from arm to arm, it\r\nwould be no harmless ailment; for the evidence was distinct that it\r\nwas frequently a severe one. For example, Edinburgh told Pearson\r\nthat when suffering from Cowpox he had to give up work and go into\r\nan hospital; and Grimshaw that the disease was uncommonly painful,\r\nwith swellings in his armpits, sore to the touch; and the servant\r\nat Rhodes’s farm in the Hampstead Road, who had seen much Cowpox in\r\nWiltshire and Gloucestershire, said the milkers were sometimes so\r\nill that they had to keep their beds for several days, though none\r\never died of the Cowpox fever. If, however, by transmission from\r\narm to arm, Cowpox became milder, it was not improbable that at the\r\nsame time it would lose more or less of its protective efficacy.\r\n\r\nPearson might have seen and added, that resistance to inoculated\r\nSmallpox, when the constitution was in no humour for Smallpox, was\r\nno proof that the same constitution would resist Smallpox when\r\nepidemic, or in condition for the evolution of the disease.\r\n\r\nPearson likewise took objection to Jenner’s evidence (such as it\r\nwas) that it was possible to take Cowpox after Cowpox, but not\r\nSmallpox after Cowpox; saying--\r\n\r\n  Most of professional men are extremely reluctant in yielding\r\n  assent to this statement. Some, indeed, reject it in the most\r\n  unqualified terms. That Cowpox follows Cowpox appears certain,\r\n  but that Cowpox should avert Smallpox, and not avert itself\r\n  appears incredible. (P. 44.)\r\n\r\nHere we see Pearson on the verge of discovery of the illusion, but\r\nwith all his training and Yorkshire shrewdness he lost the scent,\r\nand allowed himself to be deceived; and not only deceived, but to\r\nbecome a prime mover in the deception of the world. Jenner felt the\r\ndifficulty and replied--\r\n\r\n    CHELTENHAM, _27th September, 1798_.\r\n\r\n  MY DEAR SIR,--You may be assured that a person may be repeatedly\r\n  affected, both locally and generally, by the Cowpox, two\r\n  instances of which I have adduced, and have many more in my\r\n  recollection; but, nevertheless, I have some reason to suspect\r\n  that my discriminations have not been, till lately, sufficiently\r\n  nice.... Certain it is, that the skin is always subject to the\r\n  ulcerative effects of the virus; but whether the constitution can\r\n  repeatedly feel the primary effects of it, I have experiments in\r\n  view to determine. (P. 99.)\r\n\r\nThis passage is commended to those who hold with Mr. John Simon\r\nthat Jenner delivered to the world “a Master-piece of Medical\r\nInduction,” the fruit of thirty years of incessant thought,\r\nwatching and experiment. It is plain that in 1798 the very elements\r\nof the problem were by him undetermined, and the most obvious\r\nobjections unforeseen and unconsidered.\r\n\r\nPearson’s strongest opposition was reserved for the asserted origin\r\nof Cowpox in Horsegrease. He said--\r\n\r\n  It has no better support than the coincidence in some instances\r\n  of the two diseases in the same farm in which the same servants\r\n  are employed among the Horses and Cows.\r\n\r\n  I have found that in many farms the Cowpox breaks out although no\r\n  new-comer has been introduced to the herd; although the milkers\r\n  do not come in contact with the Horses; although there are no\r\n  greased Horses; and even although there are no Horses kept on the\r\n  farm.\r\n\r\n  It appears that the Cowpox does not break out under the most\r\n  favourable circumstances, if it be occasioned by _the Grease_.\r\n  “I have had,” writes Sir Isaac Pennington, Cambridge, 14th\r\n  September, 1798, “Dr. Jenner’s book some weeks, and the\r\n  particulars stated in it are really astonishing. I have made\r\n  inquiries upon the subject at Cottenham and Willingham, in which\r\n  two parishes 3000 milch Cows are kept; also a great many Horses\r\n  of the rough-legged cart kind (much liable to the scratches or\r\n  grease) half the parishes being under the plough, and the men\r\n  much employed in milking. But I cannot find that any pustulous\r\n  eruptions on the teats of the Cows, or on the hands of the\r\n  milkers, have ever been heard of.” (P. 82.)\r\n\r\nIn the opening of his _Inquiry_, Pearson was good enough to say of\r\nJenner, “I would not pluck a sprig of laurel from the wreath that\r\ndecorates his brow”; but, disputing the origin of genuine Cowpox in\r\nHorsegrease, he might have asked himself, what sprig of laurel he\r\nhad left. That Cowpox originated in Horsegrease was not Jenner’s\r\ndiscovery. As Pearson ascertained in the London milk farms, “There\r\nwas such a notion entertained in several parts of the country,\r\nwhatever might be its foundation.” (P. 86.) But the definition of\r\nHorsegrease Cowpox as the form of Cowpox that justified the faith\r\nof the country-folk in the power of the disease to avert Smallpox,\r\nwas Jenner’s solitary distinction--the principle and motive of\r\nhis _Inquiry_, which, to prove fallacious, was to extinguish his\r\ntitle to regard. Cowpox apart from Horsegrease was clearly taught\r\nby Jenner to have no influence on the constitution, and to be\r\nattended with no erysipelas. “Let me call your attention,” he wrote\r\nto Pearson, 27th September, 1798, “to a similarity between the\r\nSmallpox and the Cowpox when inoculated. The symptoms of absorption\r\nfirst disturb the system, and, secondly, the system feels the\r\nconsequences of the local sores. Exactly so with the Cowpox; and\r\n_as the Cowpox inflammation is always of the erysipelatous kind_,\r\nwhen it spreads over the skin to any great extent, it produces\r\nsymptoms not unlike the confluent Smallpox.” (P. 100.)\r\n\r\nPearson foresaw that if the principle of inoculation with Cowpox\r\nwere established it would lead to other applications--\r\n\r\n  The Cow Poison appears to alter the human constitution, so as to\r\n  render it insusceptible of a different morbific poison, namely,\r\n  the variolous in producing the Smallpox. This fact is, I believe,\r\n  quite a novelty in physiology and pathology: it indicates a new\r\n  principle in the mode of prophylactic practice. And we now see a\r\n  principle upon which diseases from various other morbific poisons\r\n  may possibly be prevented from taking place, such as the Measles,\r\n  Ulcerous Sore Throat, Hooping Cough, Syphilis, etc., namely, in\r\n  consequence of destroying the excitability of the constitution\r\n  to such poisons by the agency of different, and perhaps less\r\n  hurtful ones. Whether the Cowpox preserves the constitution from\r\n  other morbific poisons, besides the variolous, is an undecided\r\n  question. (P. 79.)\r\n\r\nLike Jenner, he also recognised in Cowpox a counter-irritant--a\r\nsafe sort of fever that might be used to drive off other diseases--\r\n\r\n  If it be true that the same constitution is liable to undergo\r\n  repeatedly the Cowpox, to which distemper no one has fallen a\r\n  victim, practitioners may avail themselves of this means of\r\n  exciting an innocent fever as a remedy of various disorders; it\r\n  being a truth, admitted by men of experience, that fevers are\r\n  occasionally efficacious remedies, especially for inveterate\r\n  chronic maladies, such as Epilepsy, Hysteria, Insanity, St.\r\n  Vitus’s Dance, Tetanus, skin deformities and diseases, etc. (P.\r\n  81.)\r\n\r\nNor was the notion without warrant, for Smallpox itself was\r\ncredited with a double action as a generator and exterminator of\r\ndisease--\r\n\r\n  A disposition to certain diseases, and even diseases themselves,\r\n  are not rarely brought on by the Smallpox; but sometimes also\r\n  dispositions to diseases, and diseases themselves of the most\r\n  inveterate kind are removed by the Smallpox. (P. 77.)\r\n\r\nIn one respect, Jenner showed himself superior to Pearson, namely,\r\nin offering some explanation of Cowpox. Pearson accepted the\r\ndisease on the rural terms--as an eruption on Cows attended with\r\nno serious illness. If in any way such Pox was equivalent to\r\nSmallpox, it was inexplicable that it should be limited to the\r\nudder and teats of milch cattle, and that males, and females not in\r\nmilk, should be exempt from infection. A disease so unique wanted\r\naccounting for; but Pearson made no attempt to account for it,\r\nnor gave any sign that he apprehended the difficulty. Jenner, on\r\nthe other hand, accounted for Pox on the Cow by referring it to\r\ninfection from the Horse conveyed by the milkers, which explanation\r\nPearson rejected. But in giving Jenner credit for so much, let\r\nit not be for over much. Whilst he ascribed Cowpox to a credible\r\ncause, he did not recognise his advantage and summon gainsayers\r\nto explain how Cowpox, as described by them, could exist without\r\nBullpox. On the contrary, as we shall see, Jenner submitted to be\r\nsilenced on this point for reasons far from creditable.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[105] _An Inquiry concerning the History of the Cowpox, principally\r\nwith a view to supersede and extinguish the Smallpox._ By George\r\nPearson, M.D., F.R.S., Physician to St. George’s Hospital, etc.\r\nLondon, 1798, 8vo., pp. 116.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nWOODVILLE, PEARSON AND JENNER.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother early and earnest examiner of Jenner’s _Inquiry_ was Dr.\r\nWilliam Woodville, physician to the London Smallpox and Inoculation\r\nHospital. He was a Cumberland man, born at Cockermouth, 1752; a\r\nmember of the Society of Friends. An ardent botanist, he turned\r\ntwo acres of the ground around the Hospital at King’s Cross into a\r\nbotanic garden, which he maintained at his own expense. He died of\r\na chronic pulmonary complaint in 1805, and in his last illness had\r\nhimself removed from his house in Ely Place to the Hospital for the\r\nsake of the garden and the country air.\r\n\r\nWoodville was eager to try cowpox, but Jenner had no supply, nor\r\ncould any be had elsewhere. He therefore resorted to horsegrease,\r\nbut could make nothing of it. In his own words--\r\n\r\n  Conceiving that the distemper might be produced by inoculating\r\n  the nipples of Cows with the matter of the grease of Horses, I\r\n  proceeded to try whether the Cowpox could be actually excited\r\n  in this manner. Numerous experiments were accordingly made upon\r\n  different Cows with the matter of grease, taken in the various\r\n  stages of that disease, but without producing the desired effect.\r\n\r\n  Neither were inoculations with this matter, nor with several\r\n  other morbid secretions in the Horse, productive of any effects\r\n  upon the human subject.[106]\r\n\r\nThrice in person did Woodville submit to inoculation with\r\nhorsegrease, but in vain. Others in London and elsewhere attempted\r\nto raise pox on cows in the same way without result save\r\nmalediction on Jenner for originating such a troublesome quest.\r\n\r\nThus closed 1798 with many anxious to try the new prescription\r\nwhenever there was a chance. Early in the new year, there was a\r\ncry in London, ’Tis found! ’tis found! In Harrison’s dairy, Gray’s\r\nInn Road, close by the Smallpox Hospital, cowpox was discovered,\r\nand thither hastened Woodville, Pearson, Sir Joseph Banks, Sir\r\nWilliam Watson, Dr. Garthshore, Dr. Willan, and other medical men;\r\nand in their presence, on 19th January, Woodville inoculated six\r\npatients with the pox.[107] The eruptions on the cows’ teats were\r\ndiligently compared with the description and plates in Jenner’s\r\n_Inquiry_, and pronounced identical. Four-fifths of the 200 cows in\r\nthe dairy became affected, those not in milk escaping the disease;\r\nlikewise some of the milkers, the first being Sarah Rice, who had\r\nundergone smallpox in childhood--a proof that smallpox did not\r\nprevent cowpox. “At the same time,” wrote Dr. Pearson, “I received\r\nthe agreeable intelligence that the disease was also raging in the\r\nlargest stock of cows on the New Road, near Paddington, to which no\r\none could gain admittance but myself.”\r\n\r\nWith cowpox thus provided in abundance, Pearson and Woodville\r\nset to work--Woodville at his Hospital, and Pearson in private\r\npractice. Be it observed, however, that this London cowpox was not\r\nJenner’s cowpox. It was not horsegrease cowpox, but the variety\r\nstigmatised by Jenner as spurious. How Pearson and Woodville\r\npressed forward with their enterprise appears from the following\r\nletter, enclosing cowpox threads, sent by Pearson to two hundred\r\nmedical practitioners throughout the United Kingdom--\r\n\r\n    LEICESTER SQUARE, _12th March, 1799_.\r\n\r\n  Sir,--I hope you will pardon me for taking the liberty to inform\r\n  you (by way of additional evidence to the testimonies I have\r\n  published on the subject of the Cowpox) that upwards of 160\r\n  patients, from two weeks to forty years of age, principally\r\n  infants, have been inoculated since the 20th January last by Dr.\r\n  Woodville and myself, separately....\r\n\r\n  Not one mortal case has occurred.\r\n\r\n  Not one of the patients has been dangerously ill....\r\n\r\n  None of the patients, namely above 60, inoculated with the\r\n  Smallpox, subsequently to the Vaccine Disease, took the\r\n  infection....\r\n\r\n  In many of the cases eruptions of the body appeared, some of\r\n  which could not be distinguished from the Smallpox.\r\n\r\n  I have sent the matter of Cowpox pustules on the thread enclosed,\r\n  in order, if you approve of the inquiry, to inoculate with it;\r\n  and I entreat you to favour me with the result of your trials:\r\n  but I must trouble you to apply the test of inoculating with\r\n  variolous matter subsequently to the vaccine disorder.\r\n\r\n    GEORGE PEARSON, M.D., F.R.S.\r\n\r\n  P.S.--I am happy to be able to state that at Berkeley, Dr. Jenner\r\n  has continued his trials of inoculation with vaccine matter sent\r\n  from London with good success.\r\n\r\nJenner was of an indolent disposition, but the part Pearson was\r\nplaying stung him to action. His nephew, Rev. G. C. Jenner, wrote\r\nto him from London, and thus roused his jealousy--\r\n\r\n    NORFOLK STREET, _11th March, 1799_.\r\n\r\n  After what Mr. Paytherus has written to you it will be needless\r\n  for me to say anything to urge the necessity of your coming to\r\n  town to wear the laurels you have gained, or to prevent their\r\n  being placed on the brows of another....\r\n\r\n  Dr. Pearson is going to send circular letters to medical\r\n  gentlemen to let them know that he will supply them with Cowpox\r\n  matter upon their application to him, by which means _he_ will be\r\n  the chief person known in the business, and consequently deprive\r\n  you of that merit, or at least a great share of it, which is so\r\n  justly your due. Dr. Pearson gave a public lecture on the Cowpox\r\n  on Saturday, and adopted your opinions, except with regard to the\r\n  probability of the disease originating in Horses’ heels.... All\r\n  your friends agree that _now_ is your time to establish your fame\r\n  and fortune; but if you delay taking a personal active part any\r\n  longer, the opportunity will be lost for ever.--Your affectionate\r\n  nephew, G. C. JENNER.\r\n\r\nJenner at once communicated the alarming intelligence to his friend\r\nGardner with a sly suggestion for counter-action--\r\n\r\n    BERKELEY, _Wednesday_.\r\n\r\n  A letter just received from G. Jenner informs me that Dr. Pearson\r\n  on Saturday gave a public lecture on the Cowpox, and that it\r\n  was publicly exhibited at Sir Joseph Banks’s on Sunday evening.\r\n  He has also given out that he will furnish any gentleman at a\r\n  distance with the virus.\r\n\r\n  As this is probably done with the view of showing himself as\r\n  the first man in the concern, should not some neatly drawn\r\n  paragraphs appear from time to time in the public prints, by no\r\n  means reflecting on the conduct of P., but just to keep the idea\r\n  publicly alive that P. was not the author of the discovery--I\r\n  mean of Cowpox Inoculation.--Yours truly, E. J.\r\n\r\nAs human nature exists, it was not extraordinary that Jenner should\r\nfeel anxious over the occupation of ground he considered his own;\r\nbut at the same time it is obvious, that Pearson had done nothing\r\nwrong, nothing that was not allowable, nothing indeed that was not\r\npraiseworthy. He allowed Jenner full credit for having advertised\r\nthe Gloucestershire faith in cowpox, and for the production\r\nof certain evidence for that faith; but he set aside Jenner’s\r\nprescription of horsegrease cowpox, and was making use of a form\r\nof cowpox that Jenner had explicitly condemned. Whilst Jenner,\r\ntoo, had excited curiosity, he did nothing, or could do nothing,\r\nto satisfy it; and it was idle to expect the world to await his\r\nconvenience: nor was Pearson the man to rest content where action\r\nwas possible. As he said--\r\n\r\n  From the time of the publication of the _Inquiry_ in June, 1798,\r\n  the author contributed no further inoculated cases to the end of\r\n  that year; nor could I do more than investigate the history of\r\n  the Cowpox principally by inquiries among provincial physicians\r\n  and farmers, from whom I was enabled to confirm some of the facts\r\n  in Dr. Jenner’s book, and to render doubtful or disprove others,\r\n  and to bring to light new observations.[108]\r\n\r\nJenner was not slow to respond to his nephew’s summons to London.\r\nHe left Berkeley on the 21st of March, and remained in town until\r\nthe 11th of June, visiting medical men, asserting his own claims,\r\nand counter-acting the operations of Pearson and Woodville.\r\n\r\nIn Dr. Pearson’s circular, it will be observed, that he described\r\ninoculation with cowpox as attended with eruptions in some cases,\r\nwhich could not be distinguished from smallpox. So far as Pearson\r\nand Woodville were concerned, it was an unfortunate statement, and\r\ngave Jenner an advantage over them which he used unsparingly to\r\ntheir discredit.\r\n\r\nJenner’s claim for inoculation with cowpox was, that it excited a\r\nfever that was not infectious and was without pustular eruptions;\r\nand here was Dr. Pearson setting up as his critic, and Dr.\r\nWoodville assuming to develop his practice, and producing a\r\ndisorder that was indistinguishable from smallpox! Such presumption\r\nand ignorance deserved to be hooted.\r\n\r\nWhat was the explanation? Simply this: that Woodville conducted\r\nsome of his cowpox inoculations in the variolous atmosphere of his\r\nHospital, and that he thereby communicated smallpox and cowpox\r\nsimultaneously. In a scientific sense, the experience was valuable;\r\nit proved that it was possible to have cowpox and smallpox at the\r\nsame time--that neither disease superseded or nullified the other.\r\n\r\nWoodville tried to vindicate himself, and in his failure magnified\r\nJenner’s triumph still further. Yet he had much that was reasonable\r\nto say for himself. For example, he had transmitted to Jenner some\r\nof the virus from one of the first of his cowpox inoculations in\r\nJanuary, and with it Jenner operated on twenty persons, reporting\r\nto Woodville--\r\n\r\n    BERKELEY, _February, 1799_.\r\n\r\n  The rise, progress, and termination of the pustules created by\r\n  the virus were exactly that of the true Cowpox.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, wrote Woodville--\r\n\r\n  This virus which Dr. Jenner declared to be perfectly pure and\r\n  genuine was taken from the arm of an hospital patient who had 310\r\n  pustules, all of which suppurated.\r\n\r\nWoodville also argued, that “Cowpox, as casually produced by\r\nmilking infected cows, differs considerably from that which is the\r\neffect of inoculation”; which Jenner attested in saying--\r\n\r\n  Four or five servants were inoculated at a farm contiguous to\r\n  Berkeley last summer with matter just taken from an infected Cow.\r\n  A little inflammation appeared on all their arms, but died away\r\n  without producing a pustule; yet all these servants caught the\r\n  disease within a month afterwards from milking the infected Cows,\r\n  and some of them had it severely.[109]\r\n\r\nOthers maintained that the cowpox which saved milkmaids from\r\nsmallpox was a much severer affection than that induced by\r\nJenner’s lancet, and that it was folly to assume their equivalence.\r\nThere was force in the argument; for every one then knew how much\r\nthe issue of smallpox inoculation depended on the mode of its\r\nperformance. The infection when communicated through the skin was\r\nusually much less severe than when communicated by incision; and\r\nJenner related how a country inoculator, who liked to “cut deep\r\nenough to see a bit of fat,” was the death of his patients on every\r\nside. The human body is of infinite delicacy and complexity, and we\r\nare sure to find ourselves at fault when we deal with its mysteries\r\naccording to our crude and inanimate logic. It is by experiment and\r\nnot by syllogism that physiological truth is verified.\r\n\r\nWhatever might be the perils, immediate or remote, of inoculation\r\nwith cowpox, it was not attended with smallpox eruption; and at\r\nlast it became manifest to Woodville himself, that the virus he had\r\nused, and the virus he had distributed, which had produced such\r\neruption, was the virus of smallpox.\r\n\r\nAfter much controversy and many experiments these conclusions were\r\narrived at--\r\n\r\n1. That when a person was inoculated with smallpox and cowpox about\r\nthe same time, both inoculations proved effective. There was a\r\npustular eruption on the skin from the smallpox, and the cowpox\r\nvesicle reached maturity in the usual number of days.\r\n\r\n2. These effects took place, without much variation, in all cases\r\nwhere the interval between the two inoculations did not exceed a\r\nweek; but--\r\n\r\n3. When the smallpox matter was inserted on the ninth day after\r\nthe inoculation with cowpox, its action seemed to be wholly\r\nprecluded.[110]\r\n\r\nThat is to say, for a time--until the influence of the vaccine\r\nfever had worn off. Some fancied that smallpox when inoculated\r\nwith cowpox generated a hybrid pox that was more efficacious than\r\neither. There was occasionally some interaction of the diseases,\r\nas of a subdued activity in each, but generally they proceeded\r\ntogether unaffected, the cowpox maintaining its characteristics in\r\nthe midst of a crop of smallpox.\r\n\r\nOne point of great significance in Woodville’s experience was\r\noverlooked. He inoculated with cowpox in the Smallpox Hospital, and\r\nsome of his patients there contracted smallpox, who certainly were\r\nnot inoculated with smallpox, either accidentally or by design.\r\nThe lesson of this experience was unperceived, and though it has\r\nbeen repeated again and again, is rarely acknowledged. Vaccination\r\nin presence of smallpox, or in an epidemic of smallpox, is often a\r\nmeans of inducing the disease it is intended to prevent. It lights\r\nthe fire; and when the fire is lighted, it is said, “Ah! it must\r\nhave been a-light before.” When we have a mind for an excuse, our\r\nsophistry is usually equal to the requisition.\r\n\r\nThe New Inoculation, as it was called, grew in favour daily.\r\nWoodville and Pearson did the real work of publicity and\r\npromotion--Pearson especially. Within seven months, January\r\nto August, 1799, they performed 2000 inoculations. In the\r\n_Philosophical Journal_, August, 1799, Pearson observed--\r\n\r\n  In Scotland the New Inoculation has not been less successful. Dr.\r\n  Anderson, of Leith, informs me that he has inoculated above 80\r\n  persons; that Dr. Duncan has begun the practice in Edinburgh and\r\n  that it has been introduced in Dundee, Paisley, and Dalkeith.\r\n\r\nNor did Pearson limit his efforts to his native land. He wrote--\r\n\r\n  In the course of the same year, 1799, I extended the\r\n  dissemination of the vaccine matter to Germany, for the Princess\r\n  Louisa at Berlin, to Hanover, Vienna, Geneva, Lisbon, Paris, and\r\n  Boston, and into the British Army through Mr. Keats.\r\n\r\nJenner regarded much of this activity with a jealous eye: it did\r\nnot sufficiently make for his glory. He was anxious, fretful,\r\nhelpless. “It is impossible for me, single-handed, to combat all my\r\nadversaries,” was his whine. “I am beset on all sides with snarling\r\nfellows, and so ignorant withal that they know no more of the\r\ndisease they write about than the animals which generate it.” In\r\norder to keep his name to the fore, he published a second pamphlet\r\nin the spring of 1799, in which are several details of biographical\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[106] _Reports of a Series of Inoculations for the Variolæ Vaccinæ\r\nor Cowpox._ London, 1799.\r\n\r\n[107] J.

Jenner wrote to Gardner, 7th March,\r\n1799--\r\n\r\n  Every sentence must be again revised and weighed in the nicest\r\n  balance that human intellect can invent. The eyes of the\r\n  philosophic and medical critic, prejudiced most bitterly against\r\n  the hypothesis, will penetrate its inmost recesses, and discover\r\n  the minutest flaw were it suffered to be present. Language I put\r\n  out of the question: it is the matter I refer to.[112]\r\n\r\nThese words betray excitement for which there was no warrant; and\r\nwhen we turn to the treatise that was to be weighed sentence by\r\nsentence in the nicest of balances, it is clearly seen that its\r\nauthor was a weak-minded creature. It is little more than a gossip\r\nabout Cowpox without advance upon the statements of the _Inquiry_.\r\nIndeed, he sets out with the admission--\r\n\r\n  Although it has not been in my power to extend the Inquiry into\r\n  the causes and effects of the Variolæ Vaccinæ much beyond its\r\n  original limits, yet, perceiving that it is beginning to excite\r\n  a general spirit of investigation, I think it is of importance,\r\n  without delay, to communicate such facts as have since occurred,\r\n  and to point out the fallacious sources from whence a disease\r\n  resembling the true Variolæ Vaccinæ might arise, with the view\r\n  of preventing those who may inoculate from producing a spurious\r\n  disease; and further, to enforce the precaution suggested in\r\n  the former Treatise on the subject, of subduing the inoculated\r\n  pustule as soon as it has sufficiently produced its influence on\r\n  the constitution. (P. 69.)\r\n\r\nSometimes when it is objected that the evidence adduced in the\r\n_Inquiry_ was hastily collected, meagre and inconclusive, it is\r\nreplied, “Yes, but recollect, it was merely a selection, if a poor\r\none, from the author’s stores”--a reply which Jenner thus renders\r\nnugatory in recording--\r\n\r\n  My late publication contains a relation of _most of the facts\r\n  which had come under my own inspection at the time it was\r\n  written_, interspersed with some conjectural observations--(P.\r\n  70)--\r\n\r\nWhich is exactly what any perspicacious reader would infer from\r\nthe cases adduced in the _Inquiry_. They were Jenner’s best and\r\nhis all. Meanwhile, as observed, he had been able to do little in\r\nextension of the Inquiry; but if idle and helpless, Dr. Pearson had\r\nbeen active--\r\n\r\n  Since then Dr. George Pearson has established an inquiry into the\r\n  validity of my principal assertion, the result of which cannot\r\n  but be highly flattering to my feelings. It contains [Pearson’s\r\n  _Inquiry_] not a single case which I think can be called an\r\n  exception to the fact I was so firmly impressed with--that the\r\n  Cowpox protects the human body from the Smallpox. (P. 70.)\r\n\r\nHere we have a distinct mis-statement. It was not Jenner’s “fact”\r\nthat Cowpox protected the human body from Smallpox--that was a\r\nwidespread superstition. His contribution to the question was\r\na definition of the Cowpox effective against Smallpox, namely\r\nHorsegrease Cowpox, other Cowpox being adjudged spurious. Pearson\r\nso far from confirming Jenner’s position, deliberately set it\r\naside. He not only accepted the rural faith in Cowpox (which Jenner\r\nknew to be unwarrantable), but, when he proceeded to practice,\r\nmade use of Cowpox which owed nothing to Horsegrease. If therefore\r\nPearson’s procedure was “highly flattering” to Jenner’s feelings,\r\nhe was either easily pleased, or an adept in dissimulation.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, the publication of _Further Observations_ was\r\ndesigned by Jenner to loosen himself from what was definite in\r\nthe _Inquiry_, so that he might be able to appropriate whatever\r\nmight result from the investigations and experiments then going\r\non. He had defined prophylactic Cowpox as Horsegrease Cowpox, but\r\nHorsegrease did not meet with favour, nor appear likely to answer;\r\nand it might be expedient to drop it; and thus he described the\r\nground of his attachment to that form of specific--\r\n\r\n  Firstly.--I conceived that Horsegrease was the source of Cowpox\r\n  from observing that where the Cowpox had appeared among the\r\n  dairies here [Berkeley] (unless it could be traced to the\r\n  introduction of an infected cow or servant) it had been preceded\r\n  at the farm by a Horse diseased in the manner described, which\r\n  Horse had been attended by some of the milkers.\r\n\r\n  Secondly.--From its being a popular opinion throughout this great\r\n  dairy country, and from its being insisted on by those who here\r\n  attend sick cattle.\r\n\r\n  Thirdly.--From the total absence of the disease in those\r\n  countries where the men servants are not employed in the dairies.\r\n\r\n  Fourthly.--From having observed that morbid matter generated by\r\n  the Horse frequently communicates, in a casual way, a disease to\r\n  the human subject so like the Cowpox, that in many cases it would\r\n  be difficult to make the distinction between one and the other.\r\n\r\n  Fifthly.--From being induced to suppose from experiments, that\r\n  some of those who had been thus affected from the Horse resisted\r\n  the Smallpox.\r\n\r\n  Sixthly.--From the progress and general appearance of the pustule\r\n  on the arm of the boy whom I inoculated with matter taken from\r\n  the hand of a man infected by a Horse; and from the similarity to\r\n  the Cowpox of the general constitutional symptoms which followed.\r\n  (P. 91.)\r\n\r\nThe boy inoculated with secondary Horsegrease was Baker, Case\r\nxviii. of the _Inquiry_. He died of fever in the parish workhouse\r\nbefore he could be subjected to the variolous test.\r\n\r\nJenner’s drift in the foregoing propositions was obviously to\r\nlighten his responsibility for the advocacy of Horsegrease as\r\nthe origin of Cowpox; but in doing so he deprived himself of\r\nany vestige of claim as a discoverer. Cowpox and Horsegrease\r\nas preventives of Smallpox were in common repute; but their\r\ncombination as Horsegrease Cowpox was supposed by some to be\r\nJenner’s peculiar specific. “Not so,” he said. “It is the\r\npopular opinion throughout the country that Cowpox is begotten\r\nof Horsegrease;” and proceeded to justify his prescription by\r\nthe popular authority. He produced a letter from Parson Moore of\r\nChalford Hill to prove how in November, 1797, his Horse had the\r\nGrease, with which his boy-servant infected the Cow, which in turn\r\ninfected the lad with Cowpox, although eighteen months before he\r\nhad been inoculated, and severely too, with Smallpox; the parson\r\nadding--\r\n\r\n  I am firmly of opinion that the disease in the heels of the\r\n  Horse, which was a virulent Grease, was the origin of the\r\n  Servant’s and the Cow’s malady. (P. 94.)\r\n\r\nTo the objection that attempts to raise Cowpox from Horsegrease\r\nhad, so far, proved failures, Jenner replied--\r\n\r\n  The experiments published by Mr. Simmons of Manchester and others\r\n  on the subject, with the view of refuting the origin of Cowpox\r\n  in Horsegrease, appear to have but little weight, as even the\r\n  Cowpock Virus itself, when repeatedly introduced into the sound\r\n  nipples of Cows by means of a lancet, was found to produce no\r\n  effect. (P. 93.)\r\n\r\nHaving reached this point, I would beg the reader to pause and\r\nask, What was Jenner’s discovery? It was not Cowpox; it was not\r\nHorsegrease; it was not Horsegrease Cowpox; all of which by his\r\nown admission were recognised by those familiar with them as\r\npreventives of Smallpox. What was it then?\r\n\r\nNothing is more conspicuous in the _Further Observations_ than the\r\ncondition of ignorance and imbecility they reveal. As we have seen,\r\ncritics of the order of Mr. John Simon represent Jenner’s _Inquiry_\r\nas a Masterpiece of Medical Induction, the fruit of thirty years\r\nof incessant thought, observation and experiment; whilst the\r\npatience, the caution, and the modesty of the author are commended\r\nfor imitation. Those who have been subjected to Mr. Simon’s homily\r\ncannot but suffer disenchantment when they come face to face with\r\nthe facts. Not after his thirty years of asserted research could\r\nJenner answer the simple question, What is Cowpox? Incredible as it\r\nmay appear, the following was his deliverance in presence of the\r\ndoubts excited by the discussion of his original communication--\r\n\r\n  To what length pustulous diseases of the udder and nipples of the\r\n  Cow may extend, it is not in my power to determine; but certain\r\n  it is, that these parts of the animal are subject to some variety\r\n  of maladies of this nature; and as many of these eruptions\r\n  (probably all of them) are capable of giving a disease to the\r\n  human body, would it not be discreet for those engaged in this\r\n  investigation to suspend controversy and cavil until they can\r\n  ascertain with precision what _is_ and what _is not_ the genuine\r\n  Cowpox? Until experience has determined which is the _true_\r\n  Cowpock, and which is _spurious_, we view our object through a\r\n  mist. (P. 73.)\r\n\r\nConsider this declaration after thirty years of incessant thought,\r\nobservation and experiment! The Masterpiece of Medical Induction\r\nwith the essential fact undetermined! The discovery undiscovered!\r\nAnd the reputed discoverer sitting ready to appropriate any praise\r\nor profit from the execution by others of his proper business! Was\r\nthere ever such an exhibition of self-satisfied futility?\r\n\r\nAmong the gossip adduced to show that the country folk called\r\neruptions Cowpox that were not Cowpox, we learn that the affection\r\ninduced by Horsegrease was thus designated--\r\n\r\n  From the similarity of symptoms, both constitutional and\r\n  local, between the Cowpox and the disease received from the\r\n  morbid matter generated by a Horse, the common people in this\r\n  neighbourhood, by a strange perversion of terms, frequently call\r\n  it the Cowpox. (P. 95.)\r\n\r\nWherefore, he argued, many thus affected may fancy themselves\r\nsecure from Smallpox, supposing they have suffered Cowpox, when\r\nthey have undergone nothing but Horsegrease; and in the event\r\nof incurring Smallpox, would bring discredit on the virtue of\r\ntrue Cowpox. How easy it was to confound the two diseases, he\r\nillustrated from the case of William Morris, a servant, aged 32,\r\nwho applied to him on 2nd April, 1798--\r\n\r\n  His symptoms and the sores on his hands were so exactly like the\r\n  Cowpox, that I pronounced he had taken the distemper from milking\r\n  Cows. He assured me he had not milked a Cow for more than half\r\n  a year, and that his master’s Cows had nothing the matter with\r\n  them. I then asked him if his master had a Greasy Horse, which\r\n  he answered in the affirmative; and further said, that he had\r\n  constantly dressed him twice a day for the last three weeks or\r\n  more, and remarked that the smell of his hands was much like that\r\n  of the Horse’s heels. (P. 97.)\r\n\r\nThus Horsegrease sores so simulated those of Cowpox, or of\r\nHorsegrease Cowpox, as to be indistinguishable from them. At this\r\ntime it was Jenner’s opinion that Horsegrease, _per se_, afforded\r\nno protection from Smallpox: it had to pass through the Cow to\r\nacquire its sovereign efficacy. The opinion is noteworthy in view\r\nof its absolute surrender at a later period, when the virus from\r\nthe Horse’s heel came to be described by him as “the true and\r\ngenuine life preserving fluid,” and was used by him for inoculation\r\nwithout any reference to the Cow.\r\n\r\nOne of the aims of _Further Observations_ was “to enforce the\r\nprecaution of subduing the inoculated pustule as soon as it had\r\nsufficiently produced its effect on the constitution.” True\r\nCowpox, according to Jenner, was a serious affection. “The sores\r\nate into the flesh.” (P. 77.) They were capable of producing\r\nviolent effects. They were attended with erysipelas. “They closely\r\nresembled Smallpox of the confluent sort.” (P. 111.) To prolong\r\nsuch suffering he considered useless, for the virus conferred its\r\nprotective influence on the constitution as soon as received--\r\n\r\n  The symptoms which (as in the accidental Cowpox) affect the\r\n  patient with severity, are entirely secondary, excited by the\r\n  irritating processes of inflammation and ulceration; and it\r\n  appears to me this singular virus possesses an irritating quality\r\n  of a peculiar kind; but as a single Cowpox pustule is all that is\r\n  necessary to render the variolous virus ineffectual, and as we\r\n  possess the means of allaying the irritation, should any arise,\r\n  it becomes of little or no consequence. (P. 110.)\r\n\r\nThe means for allaying the irritation were mercurial ointment,\r\nacetate of lead, caustic potash, or any suitable escharotic--\r\n\r\n  After the pustule has duly exerted its influence, I should prefer\r\n  the destroying it quickly and effectually to any other mode.\r\n  The term caustic to a tender ear (and I conceive none will feel\r\n  more interested in this Inquiry than the anxious guardians of a\r\n  nursery) may sound harsh and unpleasing, but every solicitude\r\n  that may arise on this account will no longer exist when it is\r\n  understood that the pustule in a state fit to be acted upon is\r\n  then quite superficial, and that it does not occupy the space of\r\n  a silver penny. (P. 104.)\r\n\r\n  I would not, however, recommend any application to subdue the\r\n  action of the pustule until convincing proofs had appeared of\r\n  the patient having felt its effects for at least twelve hours.\r\n  No harm indeed could ensue were a longer period to elapse before\r\n  the application was made use of. In short, the pustule should be\r\n  suffered to have as full an effect as it could, consistently with\r\n  the state of the arm. (P. 109.)\r\n\r\nHorsegrease annoyed Pearson--it was like to damn the whole thing;\r\nand this treatment of the Cowpox pustule was scarcely less\r\nobjectionable to him and to Woodville.[113] It gave the public,\r\nthey thought, a sense of the virulence of Cowpox that was wholly\r\nunwarrantable; and they did not stay to consider whether what\r\nJenner called Cowpox in Gloucestershire and what they called Cowpox\r\nin London were the same virus. Jenner’s virus was Horsegrease\r\nCowpox; Pearson and Woodville’s was Cowpox; and such being the\r\ncase, the diversity of symptoms might have been accounted for.\r\nAnyhow, the difference between Jenner and Pearson and Woodville, as\r\nto a detail so elementary, shows in what an unfinished condition\r\nthe Cowpox prescription was shot upon the world, and affords\r\na curious commentary on the Masterpiece of Medical Induction,\r\nthe fruit of thirty years of incessant thought, observation and\r\nexperiment. At the same time we have to do Jenner the justice of\r\nallowing that at this date, 1799, he made no pretence to a finished\r\nMasterpiece, but ingenuously ascribed the prevalent uncertainty\r\nto “the present early stage of the Cowpox Inquiry; for early,” he\r\nwrote, “it must be deemed.” (P. 115.) Early it was: not a point\r\nfirmly determined: the reverse of what might have been expected\r\nafter thirty years of incessant thought, observation and experiment.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[111] _Further Observations on the Variolæ Vaccinæ._ By Edward\r\nJenner, M.D., F.R.S.

It was the first establishment of the kind\r\nin the world. In the conspectus of the Institution it was stated--\r\n\r\n  Of above 4000 persons who have had the inoculated Cowpock one\r\n  only has died. There is, however, good ground for believing that\r\n  the proportional mortality will be even less than here stated.\r\n\r\n  Not a single well-attested instance has been produced among\r\n  more than 2000 inoculated with Cowpock, and subsequently with\r\n  Smallpox, of the Smallpox being taken, although many were exposed\r\n  to the infectious effluvia of that disease. Traditionally the\r\n  fact is established from time immemorial that after Cowpox there\r\n  is no Smallpox.\r\n\r\n  It may be fairly affirmed, that the inoculated Cowpock is\r\n  generally a much slighter disease than the inoculated Smallpox;\r\n  and that the proportion of severe cases in the latter is to the\r\n  former as at least ten to one.\r\n\r\n  It does not appear the genuine Vaccine Pock can be propagated\r\n  like the Smallpox by effluvia from persons labouring under it.\r\n  Hence if the Vaccine Inoculation should be universally instituted\r\n  in place of the Smallpox, it is reasonable to conclude, that this\r\n  most loathsome and fatal malady will be extinguished; and, like\r\n  the Sweating-Sickness, the Plague, certain forms of leprosy,\r\n  etc., be known in this country only by name.\r\n\r\n  It does not appear that the Vaccine Poison, like that of the\r\n  Smallpox, can be conveyed so as to produce the disease indirectly\r\n  from diseased persons, by adhering to clothes, furniture,\r\n  bedding, letters, etc. Hence no danger of its propagation in\r\n  these channels is to be apprehended from the universal practice\r\n  of the inoculation of the Cowpock.\r\n\r\n  It has been found that a person, whose constitution has\r\n  distinctly undergone the Vaccine Disease, is in future\r\n  insusceptible of the same disorder. [_Thus re-vaccination was\r\n  treated as impossible._]\r\n\r\n  Experience shows, that there is no reason to apprehend the\r\n  smallest chance of deformities of the skin from the Vaccine\r\n  Inoculation.\r\n\r\n  The extensive practice of the Vaccine Inoculation in the present\r\n  year, and the accounts of the disease in the casual way do not\r\n  show that any other disease will be excited subsequently.\r\n\r\n  A further considerable public benefit expected is, that a stock\r\n  of efficacious Vaccine Matter, _free from contamination by the\r\n  Smallpox_, will by this Institution be preserved for the use of\r\n  the public.\r\n\r\nThese statements are interesting as showing how early the\r\nrollicking tunes were set to which at this day we are expected\r\nto dance. The last paragraph is noteworthy as a confession\r\nunder Pearson’s hand that vaccine poison had got confused with\r\nvariolous, and that the mistake would henceforth be avoided.\r\nJenner maliciously and persistently used this mishap, for which\r\nWoodville was responsible, to discredit Pearson and magnify his\r\nown pretensions; but, as Pearson observed, neither Jenner nor any\r\none else knew that it was possible to have cowpox and smallpox\r\nsimultaneously. The mistake was made, however; and, as is the\r\nfunction of mistakes, knowledge was enlarged. Pearson’s behaviour\r\nin the matter was as creditable to him as Jenner’s was otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe Vaccine Pock Institution was organised with a staff of\r\nphysicians, surgeons, and apothecaries of the highest London\r\nrespectability; and as it was desired to have the benefit\r\nof Jenner’s name (his active co-operation, as a resident in\r\nGloucestershire, being out of the question) Pearson wrote to him--\r\n\r\n    LONDON, _10th December, 1799_.\r\n\r\n  We have made some progress in the institution of a charity for\r\n  inoculating the Vaccine Pock. I do not know that I can confer any\r\n  honour on you by proposing you (if I am able) to the directors of\r\n  our establishment, nor do I well know what to propose to you. It\r\n  occurs to me that it might not be disagreeable to you to be an\r\n  extra corresponding physician.\r\n\r\n  No expense will be attached to your situation except a guinea a\r\n  year as a subscriber; and indeed I think you ought to be exempt\r\n  from that, as you cannot send any patients: but you may depute\r\n  some proxy in town.\r\n\r\n  I confess I was surprised that you neither called nor sent for me\r\n  for the last _two_ months you were in town. However, if it was\r\n  because you were too much occupied, I certainly excuse you.\r\n\r\nThe invitation was given stiffly, from duty more than inclination.\r\nPearson knew very well why Jenner, furious with jealousy, had kept\r\naway from him; and he was thus answered--\r\n\r\n    BERKELEY, _17th December, 1799_.\r\n\r\n  SIR,--I received your letter of the 10th instant, and confess I\r\n  felt surprised at the information it conveys.\r\n\r\n  It appears to me somewhat extraordinary that an institution\r\n  formed upon so large a scale, and that has for its object the\r\n  inoculation of the Cowpox, should have been set on foot and\r\n  almost completely organised without my receiving the most distant\r\n  intimation of it. The institution itself cannot, of course, but\r\n  be highly flattering to me, as I am thereby convinced that the\r\n  importance of the fact I imparted is acknowledged by men of the\r\n  first abilities. But at the same time allow me to observe that\r\n  if the Vaccine Inoculation, from unguarded conduct, should sink\r\n  into disrepute (and you must admit, Sir, that in more than one\r\n  instance has its reputation suffered) I alone must bear the\r\n  odium. To you, or any other of the gentlemen whose names you\r\n  mention as filling up the medical departments, it cannot possibly\r\n  attach.\r\n\r\n  At the present crisis I feel so sensibly the importance of the\r\n  business that I shall certainly take an early opportunity of\r\n  being in London. For the present I must beg leave to decline the\r\n  _honour_ intended me.--I remain, Sir, your obedient Servant,\r\n\r\n    E. JENNER.[114]\r\n\r\nPearson’s reply to this absurd and thoroughly Jennerian letter\r\ndoes not appear. He might have thanked Jenner for having drawn\r\nhis attention to cowpox, and have proceeded to point out that\r\nbeyond that service he and his friends owed him nothing, nor in\r\nanywise admitted his guardianship. Their practice was at complete\r\nvariance with his teaching. He had prescribed horsegrease cowpox\r\nin which they had no faith, having tried to produce it in vain. On\r\nthe other hand, they were operating with cowpox _per se_, which\r\nhe had condemned as useless, being attended with no erysipelas\r\nor constitutional effect; and that working with this condemned\r\ncowpox, they found themselves producing a much milder disease, and\r\nwere under no necessity of following his advice and destroying\r\nthe pustule formed at the point of inoculation with escharotics;\r\nadding, that if they had been bound to his horsegrease and\r\ncaustics, they would have made no progress with the public whatever.\r\n\r\nVaccine Inoculation might be good for mankind, but it was to\r\nbe something better for Edward Jenner. There was not the least\r\nreason, outside his jealousy and rapacity, why he should not\r\nhave congratulated Pearson on his enterprise and promised his\r\nassistance. As to claiming the guardianship of Vaccine Inoculation,\r\nit was preposterous: it had passed wholly beyond his control. It\r\nwas Pearson’s complaint that Jenner never did anything useful after\r\nthe publication of _The Inquiry_. He left to others the discovery\r\nof virus, and the labour and responsibility of experimenting, and\r\nonly appeared on the scene when there was some disaster whereat\r\nhe could play the part of superior person, whilst insisting that\r\nall supposed improvements and successes should be assigned to his\r\ncredit.\r\n\r\nJenner is all-in-all in the vaccinators’ hagiology, but he holds\r\nthe place at the cost of justice to Pearson and Woodville. To prove\r\nthat I am not making a fanciful assertion, let me cite unprejudiced\r\ncontemporary evidence. Dr. Paterson of Montrose in a communication\r\nto the _Medical and Physical Journal_, dated 25th May, 1801,\r\nobserved--\r\n\r\n  While we are irresistibly led to join the wondering, the grateful\r\n  throng, in paying the just tribute of applause to Dr. Jenner,\r\n  the immortal discoverer, we must, at the same time, confess how\r\n  much we are indebted to the ingenious and benevolent Dr. Pearson\r\n  for bringing, in such a handsome manner as he did, the business\r\n  before the public; thereby exciting, all at once, a universal,\r\n  an unparalleled quest of investigation, and furnishing, by\r\n  innumerable and satisfactory experiments, a complete confirmation\r\n  of the noble discovery.\r\n\r\nHere, we may observe afresh, that Pearson did not confirm Jenner’s\r\n“noble discovery.” On the contrary, his use of cowpox was at\r\ndistinct variance with Jenner’s prescription of horsegrease cowpox,\r\nand with his condemnation of cowpox. Jenner, as we shall see,\r\nfollowed Pearson: Pearson did nothing to confirm Jenner.\r\n\r\nWoodville lent his powerful influence as head of the Smallpox\r\nHospital to establish the New Inoculation. He put Jenner’s\r\nprescription to the test with perfect sincerity and admirable\r\ncourage, suffering himself to be thrice inoculated with horsegrease\r\nin order to come at the truth;[115] and only resorted to cowpox\r\nwhen he found horsegrease cowpox unattainable. Mr. Anthony\r\nHighmore, surgeon, speaking over Woodville’s grave in 1805,\r\nexclaimed--\r\n\r\n  Who that have felt the benefits of Vaccination will not teach\r\n  their children, and their children’s children, to bless the name\r\n  of Woodville when they bless the name of Jenner.\r\n\r\nYet Pearson and Woodville, who made the New Inoculation practical\r\nand practicable, were pursued by Jenner with implacable animosity,\r\nstigmatising their mishaps and appropriating their apparent\r\nsuccesses.\r\n\r\nTo publish a pamphlet for the detraction of Woodville, and if\r\npossible to upset Pearson’s Vaccine Pock Institution, Jenner left\r\nBerkeley for London on 28th January, 1800, taking Bath on his way,\r\nwhere also a Vaccine Pock Institution was in progress.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1800 appeared _A Continuation of Facts and Observations\r\nrelative to the Variolæ Vaccinæ_--a quarto of 40 pages, Jenner’s\r\nthird pamphlet. Like its predecessor, a trumpery collection of\r\ngossip, it was designed to manifest his advantage over Woodville,\r\nwho had inadvertently confused cowpox with smallpox in his\r\ninoculations at the Hospital.\r\n\r\nFirst, Jenner expressed satisfaction over the interest of Europe in\r\nCowpox Inoculation--\r\n\r\n  I have the pleasure, too, of seeing that the feeble efforts of a\r\n  few individuals to depreciate the new practice are sinking fast\r\n  into contempt beneath the immense mass of evidence which has\r\n  risen up in support of it.\r\n\r\nHe then went on to describe the accumulating mass of evidence--\r\n\r\n  Upwards of six thousand persons have now been inoculated with\r\n  the virus of Cowpox, and the far greater part of them have\r\n  since been inoculated with that of Smallpox, and exposed to its\r\n  infection in every rational way that could be devised, without\r\n  effect.\r\n\r\n“True,” Pearson might have observed, “but who inoculated the\r\nvast majority of the six thousand? Nor were they inoculated with\r\nthe horsegrease cowpox you prescribed, but with the cowpox you\r\ncondemned.”\r\n\r\nThe introductory reference to Woodville revealed Jenner’s\r\ndisposition and tactics--\r\n\r\n  It was very improbable that the investigation of a disease so\r\n  analogous to the Smallpox should go forward without engaging the\r\n  attention of the Physician of the Smallpox Hospital in London.\r\n\r\n  Accordingly, Dr. Woodville, who fills that department with so\r\n  much respectability, took an early opportunity of instituting an\r\n  inquiry into the nature of the Cowpox. This inquiry was begun\r\n  in the early part of 1799, and in May, Dr. Woodville published\r\n  the result, which differs essentially from mine in a point of\r\n  much importance. It appears that three-fifths of the patients\r\n  inoculated were affected with eruptions, for the most part so\r\n  perfectly resembling the Smallpox, as not to be distinguished\r\n  from them. On this subject it is necessary that I should make\r\n  some comments.\r\n\r\nWoodville, whose experiments were as a hundred to one of his\r\npatronising critic, and informed with purpose too, must have\r\nreceived this languid commendation of his country acquaintance\r\nwith some surprise, if not with fierier sentiment. Jenner as\r\nan investigator was never of much account. Of what constitutes\r\nscientific demonstration, he had little perception. Incapable and\r\nindolent, he nevertheless was ambitious, and had the craft to\r\nappropriate the research of others, and with assurance so ineffable\r\nthat even the plundered fell under the persuasion that what he\r\ntook was somehow his own. For example, the occurrence of smallpox\r\nand cowpox simultaneously in Woodville’s practice, which he had\r\nnot foreseen, nor could any foresee, he first used as a pretext\r\nfor lofty reprehension toward Woodville, and then converted into\r\nevidence of his own prescience, saying--\r\n\r\n  In my first publication I expressed an opinion that the\r\n  Smallpox and the Cowpox were the same disease under different\r\n  modifications. In this opinion, Dr. Woodville has concurred. The\r\n  axiom of the immortal Hunter, that two diseased actions cannot\r\n  take place at the same time in one and the same part, will not be\r\n  injured by the admission of this theory.\r\n\r\nMark the adroit oblivion and the adroit attachment. It was\r\nhorsegrease that he assumed to be the origin of smallpox through\r\ncowpox; and the cowpox used by Woodville was Jenner’s condemned\r\ncowpox, underived from the horse; yet the inconvenient was passed\r\nover, and the convenient assumed!\r\n\r\nPossibly cowpox and smallpox are forms of the same disease:\r\npossibly they are not: possibly all diseases are forms of one\r\ndisease: possibly they are not: but whatever the fact, Jenner had\r\nnot an iota of evidence to adduce for his conjecture that grease\r\nin horses, and pox from that grease in cows, was a modification of\r\nsmallpox in men.\r\n\r\nAs we review these early days of the New Inoculation, nothing so\r\nstirs regret as what appears to have been the wilful shutting\r\nof men’s eyes to facts--to notorious facts. It was well known\r\nin Gloucestershire, that whilst the vulgar supposed that cowpox\r\nprevented smallpox, it did not do so. Indeed, it was under stress\r\nof this knowledge that Jenner rejected cowpox _per se_ for\r\nhorsegrease cowpox. In the _Gloucester Journal_ of 9th May, 1799,\r\nMr. C. Cooke wrote--\r\n\r\n  I not only very much doubt that the Cowpox is a permanent\r\n  preventive of Smallpox, but I am confirmed in this opinion by\r\n  occurrences in my own practice, by conversing with many medical\r\n  men on the subject, and by Dr. Beddoes, who writes, “I have a\r\n  case where the Smallpox was taken after the Cowpox had been twice\r\n  gone through.”[116]\r\n\r\nYet in presence of such testimonies, which were neither examined\r\nnor exploded, Jenner prophesied in this strain--\r\n\r\n  Some there are who suppose the security from the Smallpox\r\n  obtained through the Cowpox will be of a temporary nature. This\r\n  supposition is refuted, not only by analogy with respect to\r\n  diseases of a similar nature, but by incontrovertible facts,\r\n  which appear in great numbers against it. A person had the\r\n  Cowpox 53 years before the Smallpox was tried upon him, and as\r\n  he completely resisted it, I conceive every reasonable mind must\r\n  be satisfied that he was secure from the disease during the\r\n  intervening time.\r\n\r\nSuch was the evidence that he thought should satisfy every\r\nreasonable mind! How did he know that the said person had cowpox\r\n53 years before, or had the right sort of cowpox, and in the\r\nright way? Inoculation with smallpox was continually unsuccessful\r\n(without reference to cowpox as cause of failure) and especially\r\namong elderly folk. When, however, there is a disposition to\r\nbelieve, the most indifferent reasons serve for conviction.\r\n\r\nCowpox and Smallpox, said Jenner, were modifications of the same\r\ndisease; and Smallpox, whether contracted or inoculated, was\r\na well-known excitant of scrofula; and Jenner was inclined to\r\nconsider it probable that “the general introduction of the Smallpox\r\ninto Europe had been among the most conducive means in exciting\r\nthat formidable foe to health.” Then, it might be said, Cowpox as a\r\nmodification of Smallpox must be liable to the like objection. “Not\r\nat all!” protested the smooth-spoken adventurer. “The diseases are\r\nthe same, but unlike in the excitation of scrofula”--\r\n\r\n  Having attentively watched the effects of the Cowpox in this\r\n  respect, I am happy in being able to declare, that the disease\r\n  does not appear to have the least tendency to produce this\r\n  destructive malady.\r\n\r\nConsidering his limited experience, the asseveration as to the\r\nnon-excitation of scrofula was sheer quackery, and of a piece with\r\nthe wilder assurance that follows. In 1798 he had set forth cowpox\r\nas a useful alternative to smallpox for inoculation; but in 1800\r\nthe claim was thus magnified--\r\n\r\n  When scrutiny has taken place, not only among ourselves, but in\r\n  the first professional circles in Europe, and when it has been\r\n  uniformly found in such abundant instances--\r\n\r\n  _That the Human Frame when once it has felt the influence of\r\n  the genuine Cowpox is never afterwards, at any period of its\r\n  existence, assailable by the Smallpox_,\r\n\r\n  May I not with perfect confidence congratulate my country and\r\n  society at large on their beholding in the mild form of the\r\n  Cowpox, an antidote that is capable of extirpating from the earth\r\n  a disease which is every hour devouring its victims; a disease\r\n  that has ever been considered as the severest scourge of the\r\n  human race!\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to discuss these wild words--it is sufficient to\r\nrecord them as evidence of what it was possible to assert in the\r\nyear 1800--and assert, too, whilst as yet the Cowpox that was to\r\nwork the miracle was one thing in the hands of Jenner, and another\r\nin those of Pearson and Woodville!\r\n\r\nThe pamphlet published, Jenner’s other business in London was to\r\nundermine the institution for Vaccine Pock Inoculation. He went\r\nabout insinuating and protesting that its founders and officers\r\nneither knew what was true Variolæ Vaccinæ, nor how to use it;\r\nthat not only were they ignorant, but perverse; and that the\r\nimmeasurable blessing he had been the means of conveying to mankind\r\nwould never be rightly enjoyed until there was an Institution with\r\nEdward Jenner for its guide and director.\r\n\r\nIn playing this game Jenner had facilities and advantages. No one,\r\nnot Pearson himself, contested his position as advertiser of the\r\nNew Inoculation, and to the public he was its representative. He\r\nhad attempted nothing and had no mishaps to account for: these\r\nattached to Woodville and other credulous and active experimenters.\r\n\r\nMoreover he had no awkward information to contend with in those he\r\naddressed--they listened, were informed, were convinced. Jenner’s\r\nconduct at this juncture, in relation to Pearson and Woodville,\r\nhas been stigmatised as mean, thankless, despicable. These be hard\r\nwords. His tactics were the common tactics of men in whom self-love\r\nis predominant, and we have not the strength for the use of the\r\nappropriate epithets with the frequency that experience requires.\r\n\r\nThe poor were the chief sufferers from smallpox, and under the name\r\nof the poor Jenner advanced his project. He drew up the following\r\nmemorandum, which he submitted to the Earl of Egremont, and\r\ncirculated privately--\r\n\r\n  PROPOSAL FOR A PUBLIC INSTITUTION FOR VACCINE INOCULATION.\r\n\r\n  Having now pursued the inquiry into the nature of the Cowpox to\r\n  so great an extent as to be able positively to declare that those\r\n  who have gone through this mild disease are rendered perfectly\r\n  secure from the contagion of the Smallpox; and being convinced\r\n  from numberless instances that the occupations of the mechanic or\r\n  the labourer will meet with no interruption during its progress,\r\n  and the infected and uninfected may mingle together in the most\r\n  perfect safety, I conceive that an Institution for the Gratuitous\r\n  Inoculation of the lower classes of society in the Metropolis\r\n  would be attended with the most beneficial consequences, and that\r\n  it might be so constituted as to diffuse its benefits throughout\r\n  every part of the British Empire.\r\n\r\n    EDWARD JENNER.\r\n\r\n  London, 16th March, 1800.\r\n\r\nThen followed a scheme of the Institution, including “a Physician\r\nto be appointed to superintend the medical department.”\r\n\r\nWhether from Jenner’s practical inefficiency, or because the time\r\nwas not ripe, or because those who were more actively interested in\r\ncowpox were satisfied with Pearson’s Institution, the project lay\r\nin abeyance till 1803. He took nothing ostensibly by his intrigue\r\nsave the withdrawal of the names of the Duke of York and Lord\r\nEgremont from the patronage of the existing establishment.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Pearson continued to operate with unabated energy, and\r\nhis Institution became a recognised centre of inquiry, advice,\r\nand supply. It was designed, as he wrote, “1st, to be useful to\r\nthe poor; but it had other objects, to wit, 2ndly, to ascertain\r\nthe laws of the new poison for the extinction of smallpox; and\r\n3rdly, to serve as a public office for the supply of the world with\r\nvirus until supplies should become unnecessary.” One of the most\r\nflattering applications was received by Pearson from the French\r\nConsulate on 5th April, 1800. In a reply, dated 12th May, signed by\r\nthe staff of the Institution, it was said--\r\n\r\n  We are not surprised that you have not yet found the disease\r\n  among the cows of France, it being on the whole a rare disease in\r\n  England; nor are we surprised at your want of success with the\r\n  matter sent to you, because from experience we know that it very\r\n  frequently fails, unless used immediately from the subject.\r\n\r\n  Vaccine matter may be conveyed in various ways: we have sent it\r\n  to you in three, namely, on threads, on lancets, and on glass.\r\n\r\n  If you try the matter sent on thirty patients immediately, we\r\n  think you cannot fail to excite the disease in some of them, and\r\n  then you will please to preserve the succession by inoculation\r\n  as we do in England, having had no fresh matter from the cow\r\n  since January and February of last year, 1799.\r\n\r\nThe Frenchmen failed again with this virus, but Dr. Woodville soon\r\nafter went to Paris, and effected what was desired.\r\n\r\nCow-Pock Dispensaries were opened in various towns throughout\r\nEngland, Bath and Manchester perhaps having the lead; and an\r\nAddress to the Poor was drawn up as a common form to be issued from\r\nsuch Dispensaries. In a copy of this Address, widely circulated in\r\nand around Manchester in 1800, we read--\r\n\r\n  The experience of several years has fully proved that inoculation\r\n  for the Cowpox is _a certain preservative_ against the Smallpox;\r\n  and is, besides, so mild and safe a disorder, when compared with\r\n  the inoculated Smallpox, that it has been generally introduced\r\n  among the better informed and more wealthy inhabitants, both of\r\n  this kingdom and of various parts of Europe.\r\n\r\n  Inoculation for the Cowpox has been practised for several years\r\n  [_less than three_] with constant success, in various parts of\r\n  the Kingdom.\r\n\r\n  It has never failed to prevent the infection of the natural\r\n  Smallpox.\r\n\r\n  It may be communicated with safety to persons of every age\r\n  and sex, and at all times and seasons of the year, with equal\r\n  advantage.\r\n\r\n  It does not produce eruptions, which scar and disfigure the face;\r\n  and it is seldom, if ever, attended with any other marks of the\r\n  disease than what appear on the arms from inoculation.\r\n\r\n  So far from proving hurtful, delicate and sickly children are\r\n  often improved in health by having passed through this complaint.\r\n\r\n  Scarcely any remedies or attendance are required for the Cowpox,\r\n  nor is there any necessity for a course of physic before or after\r\n  the inoculation.\r\n\r\n  The prejudices of the poor against inoculation for the Smallpox,\r\n  by which thousands of lives have been annually saved,[117]\r\n  have been often lamented; but if they suffer unjust prejudices\r\n  to prevent their laying hold of the advantages now offered to\r\n  them by the inoculation of the Cowpox, they will neglect the\r\n  performance of a duty they owe to themselves, to their families,\r\n  and to society at large. For surely it is little less than\r\n  criminal to expose their helpless children to the attack of so\r\n  terrible and fatal a malady as Smallpox when it may be readily\r\n  avoided by the inoculation of so mild, simple, and safe a disease\r\n  as that of the Cowpox.\r\n\r\n  N.B.--All poor persons, whose affection for their families\r\n  leads them to embrace this favourable opportunity, may have\r\n  their children inoculated for the Cowpox at the Hospital and\r\n  Dispensaries every day in the week (Sunday excepted) throughout\r\n  the year. No time ought to be lost by the poor in freeing their\r\n  families from the apprehension of the Smallpox, _which daily\r\n  increases in frequency and malignity throughout this town_.\r\n\r\nThis manifesto is an illustration of the unscrupulous and\r\nunwarrantable assertions with which the New Inoculation was\r\nintroduced to the world. There is no question that many who were\r\nactive in circulating these mendacities did so honestly, justified,\r\nas they thought, by medical authority. What is marvellous is the\r\nsurvival of the primitive fictions to the present day. It would\r\nseem that when the human mind acquires a certain _set_, something\r\nlike a surgical operation is requisite to reverse it.\r\n\r\nWe shall now see how the New Inoculation obtained this sudden\r\npopularity--a popularity so sudden that opposition had not time to\r\norganise itself. There were protests, and some raillery. In the\r\n_Gentleman’s Magazine_ for August, 1799, we find a correspondent\r\nsaying--\r\n\r\n  There is a plan to mitigate Smallpox in the human species by\r\n  passing it through a Cow. Now as everyone is not in possession\r\n  of a Cow, I propose to pass it through animals that most people\r\n  possess. I mean Cats; and I shall call it the Catpox. When my\r\n  plan is matured, the ingenious shall hear further concerning it.\r\n\r\nAnd Pearson writing in 1802, when the success of cowpox appeared\r\nsecure, observed--\r\n\r\n  How the new practice was sneered at by some: how it was\r\n  reprobated as a gross and mischievous imposition: how it was\r\n  stigmatised with the appellation of the Gloucestershire bubble:\r\n  and how the Inquirers were considered by many persons as fit\r\n  candidates for a certain asylum: to say nothing of the villainous\r\n  jests made on the occasion, are recent in our memory.[118]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[114] Baron’s _Life of Jenner_, vol. i. p. 360.\r\n\r\n[115] _Rees’s Cyclopædia_, vol. 38.

It was Caroline,\r\nPrincess of Wales, who in 1721 promoted Maitland’s experiments;\r\nand Jenner found none so ready to hear and believe as George\r\nIII. and his family. His first convert was the Duke of Clarence,\r\nsubsequently William IV. The Duke’s surgeon happened to be Francis\r\nKnight, who had lived in Wilts and Gloucestershire, and was\r\nfamiliar with the country faith in cowpox, and received Jenner’s\r\ncommunication with a ready mind. In 1799 Knight was allowed to\r\noperate upon the Duke’s children by Mrs. Jordan, and the fact was\r\nnoised abroad and passed to Jenner’s credit. Nor was the Duke’s\r\nservice limited to this example. He made Jenner’s acquaintance,\r\nlistened to his stories, and became his active partizan. Then the\r\nDuke of York, commander-in-chief of the army, was convinced, and\r\nenforced the new practice to the full extent of his power. He,\r\nmoreover, acted as patron of the Vaccine Pock Institution until he\r\nwas persuaded that Pearson, its founder, was injurious to Jenner.\r\nOn 7th March, 1800, Jenner was presented to George III. at St.\r\nJames’s Palace, and delivered _The Inquiry_ bound in crimson to his\r\nmajesty, who was pleased to accept the dedication of the second\r\nedition. On the 27th he had an interview with Queen Charlotte,\r\nwho conversed about the new specific with all the curiosity of\r\na grand-motherly quack. The Prince of Wales followed suit; and\r\nJenner found himself invested with the full effulgence of the royal\r\nfavour. It was a magical success; for, consider, not two years had\r\nelapsed since the publication of _The Inquiry_.\r\n\r\nJenner naturally became very popular. He wrote to Mr. Shrapnel--“I\r\nhave not yet made half my calls in town, although I fag from\r\neleven till four;” and, “Pray tell Tierney how rapidly the Cowpox\r\nis marching over the metropolis, and indeed through the whole\r\nisland. The death of three children under inoculation with smallpox\r\nwill probably give that practice the Brutus-stab.”\r\n\r\nWith little ability to make and maintain ground, Jenner, like many\r\nfeeble folk, had the faculty of converting those he called his\r\nfriends to his private advantage. He did not subdue them by will,\r\nbut by weakness. Indeed, whoever chooses to observe will often have\r\nto mark with amaze how stronger natures suffer their means and\r\nenergies to be appropriated by inferior organisms, and used with\r\nthe thanklessness of rightful possession.\r\n\r\nJohn Ring was a remarkable instance of this sort of possession.\r\nHe was a surgeon in New Street, Hanover Square, London. In 1799\r\nhe entered into correspondence with Jenner, and his interest in\r\ncowpox and its advertiser developed into an enthusiasm without\r\nqualification by weariness or fear. Whatever Jenner asserted he\r\nswore to; whatever charge was brought against the New Inoculation\r\nhe denied. He was ready for all comers with such voluble and\r\nhearty vigour that his outrages on propriety were laughed at and\r\nexcused as “John Ring’s way.” Among his earlier services was the\r\npreparation of the Testimonial in favour of the New Inoculation\r\nwhich he carried from house to house and obtained the signature\r\nof nearly every London physician and surgeon of distinction. The\r\nTestimonial was published in the _Medical Review_ and _Medical\r\nJournal_ for July, 1800, and was reprinted in the newspapers. It\r\nran as follows--\r\n\r\n  Many unfounded reports have been circulated, which have a\r\n  tendency to prejudice the public against the Inoculation of the\r\n  Cowpox: we, the undersigned physicians and surgeons, think it\r\n  our duty to declare our opinion, that those persons who have\r\n  had the Cowpox are perfectly secure from the future infection\r\n  of the Smallpox, provided the infection has not been previously\r\n  communicated.[119]\r\n\r\n  We also declare that the inoculated Cowpox is a much milder and\r\n  safer disease than the inoculated Smallpox.\r\n\r\nThe first signatures comprised thirty-two physicians and forty\r\nsurgeons, and the example being set, others hastened from town and\r\ncountry to record their adhesion. “I feel proud,” wrote Mr. Witham\r\nin sending his name, “that my little bark may, with others more\r\nillustrious,\r\n\r\n                                Attendant sail,\r\n      Pursue the triumph, and partake the gale.”\r\n\r\nThe Testimonial had great effect on the public mind: to the\r\nmajority it was irresistible. As Ring said, “It confounded the\r\nenemies of the new practice”--adding in his characteristic\r\nvernacular, “and it secured the triumph of reason over the scruples\r\nof prejudice and ignorance, and the base manœuvres of sordid and\r\nself-interested men.”[120] Thus early was it discovered that an\r\nopponent of Vaccination was an ignoramus or a rascal. Ring’s easy\r\narrogance is concisely illustrated in this deliverance--\r\n\r\n  It is no want of candour to affirm that those who are hostile to\r\n  Vaccine Inoculation, are total strangers to it; those who are\r\n  doubtful, are almost total strangers to it; and I defy the whole\r\n  world to produce one single instance of a person that has had any\r\n  experience of the disease, who is not a decided friend to the\r\n  practice.[121]\r\n\r\nJenner recognised his thorough-going supporter, and used his\r\nloyalty to strike at Pearson and others who failed to abide in like\r\nsubservience. He wrote to a foreign physician--\r\n\r\n  The discovery which I had the happiness to announce to the world\r\n  is much indebted to Mr. Ring’s ardent zeal and indefatigable\r\n  exertions for the rapid progress it has made; while some of\r\n  those _who vainly conceived themselves instrumental in promoting\r\n  its adoption_ have in reality from _their ignorance and\r\n  indiscretion_, rather retarded than accelerated its progress.[122]\r\n\r\nWonder is frequently expressed over the rapid conversion of England\r\nand the world to Vaccination, but, as I have before remarked,\r\nwonder is much reduced when we set the circumstances clearly\r\nbefore us. Inoculation with smallpox to avert smallpox was the\r\npractice of the time, and it was not a universal practice simply\r\nbecause it was troublesome and dangerous: everybody believed in\r\nthe saving rite; and where evaded it was as onerous and perilous\r\nduties are always and everywhere evaded by the indolent and\r\ncowardly. Inoculation with cowpox was introduced to the public\r\nas a substitute for inoculation with smallpox, equally efficient\r\nor more efficient, and neither troublesome nor dangerous. Thus\r\neasy and seductive was the transition from the one practice to\r\nthe other. Jenner had no serious battle to fight: the contest\r\nwas decided in the years during which inoculation with smallpox\r\nstruggled for prevalence. The warfare that subsequently cost\r\nhim so much irritation was conducted by the conservatives of\r\nInoculation, as experience revealed the inefficiency and mischiefs\r\nof Vaccination. Resistance such as is now offered to Vaccination on\r\nphysiological grounds there was none, so far as I can discover. It\r\nhad apparently occurred to no one that smallpox was a consequence\r\nof the transgression of the laws of health, and was preventible by\r\nsubmission to those laws. It was imagined that the disease came\r\nby the will of God, or the devil, or by force of fate, and that\r\nto dodge it by medical craft was the utmost that was practicable.\r\nUnless we bear in mind these conditions of the public intelligence,\r\nwe shall misapprehend the demeanour of the people who so cordially\r\nwelcomed Jenner’s advertisement. It is always a mistake to\r\ncriticise the conduct of an earlier generation by the light of a\r\nlater. We turn history to ill account when we use it to nourish our\r\nself-complacency; for the probability is that had we lived with our\r\nforefathers, we should have done exactly as they did.\r\n\r\nSome will ask, How did it ever come to pass that so many doctors\r\nin 1800 signed Ring’s testimonial certifying that inoculation\r\nwith cowpox was a sure and everlasting protection from smallpox\r\nwhen they had not, and could not have, any experience to warrant\r\ntheir assertion? True, but they had an illusory experience by which\r\nthey were beguiled, namely, the Variolous Test. Hundreds were\r\ninoculated with cowpox and subsequently with smallpox, and were\r\nalso exposed to smallpox contagion, and as the disease did not\r\ntake, it was concluded it could never take, and that the subjects\r\nof the operation were fortified for ever. The fallacy is now\r\nmanifest, but it was by no means manifest in 1800, and all manner\r\nof men received and propagated the fable with energetic sincerity.\r\nIt was once admitted that a tub full of water did not overflow when\r\na fish was slipped into it, and many explanations were current of\r\nthe curious phenomenon until a sceptical spirit suggested that the\r\nexperiment be tried. A like spirit might have suggested that it was\r\nexpedient to wait and see whether cowpox was indeed a perpetual\r\ndefence against smallpox, inasmuch as nature had an awkward habit\r\nof confuting prognostications apparently irrefragable.\r\n\r\nThe ease with which it was asserted cowpox inoculation could be\r\nperformed, coupled with its harmlessness, not to say wholesomeness,\r\nand the absolute security it afforded against smallpox, induced\r\nbenevolent busybodies to set up as vaccinators all over the\r\ncountry. What the kindly quack delights in is something cheap and\r\nhandy with a touch of mystery and the promise of immeasurable\r\nadvantage--conditions which the new practice completely fulfilled.\r\nThe memoirs of the time, especially of the Evangelical party,\r\nabound with instances in which this good soul and that good soul\r\nhad vaccinated so many hundreds or thousands, delivering them from\r\nthe peril of an awful disease. Thus in the _Gentleman’s Magazine_,\r\nfor December, 1800, we read--\r\n\r\n  Two respectable families near Manchester have within these few\r\n  months inoculated upwards of 800 of the neighbouring poor from\r\n  two months old to twenty years with uniform success. Twenty of\r\n  them were subjected to the variolous test, and all were found\r\n  proof against the disease.\r\n\r\nAnd John Ring relates--\r\n\r\n  Dr. Jenner lately met in a large party of fashion a lady of\r\n  Portman Square, who, with another lady, has inoculated 1300 in\r\n  the north of England. The rural swain, when he receives the\r\n  blessing of Jenner’s discovery from such a fair hand, must\r\n  conclude that the Goddess of Health has adopted the practice.[123]\r\n\r\nOf course medical practitioners had little favour for this sort\r\nof intrusion into their domain, but Jenner encouraged and boasted\r\nhimself in the domestic diffusion of the discovery. By and by\r\nwhen disasters became common it was found extremely convenient\r\nto ascribe them to these unskilled operators; and ultimately\r\nvaccination was resigned entirely to the legally qualified\r\npractitioner, whose failures are rarely inquired into, and when\r\nproclaimed are, as professional matter of course, explicitly denied.\r\n\r\nJenner after six months of lionising left London on 23rd June,\r\n1800, and on his way home passed through Oxford where he was\r\nintroduced to Dr. Marlow, Vice-Chancellor of the University, and\r\nother dignitaries, who subscribed the following testimonial, drawn\r\nup by Sir Christopher Pegge, Reader in Anatomy--\r\n\r\n  We, whose names are undersigned, are fully satisfied upon the\r\n  conviction of our own observation, that the Cowpox is not only\r\n  an infinitely milder disease than the Smallpox, but has the\r\n  advantage of not being contagious, and is an effectual remedy\r\n  against the Smallpox.\r\n\r\nWhen a prophet in the country turns out a prophet in London\r\nhis country neighbours begin to believe in him; and thus it\r\nwas with Jenner. His metropolitan reputation was reflected in\r\nGloucestershire. Earl Berkeley wrote to the Duke of Beaufort--\r\n\r\n  Every father of a family owes the greatest obligation to Dr.\r\n  Jenner for preventing the dreadful effects of the smallpox.\r\n\r\nAnd the sense of this obligation took shape in a service of plate\r\npresented in 1801 and bearing this inscription--\r\n\r\n    PRESENTED BY\r\n    THE NOBILITY AND GENTRY OF\r\n    THE COUNTY OF GLOUCESTERSHIRE\r\n    TO THEIR COUNTRYMAN\r\n    EDWARD JENNER, M.D., F.R.S.\r\n    AS A TESTIMONY OF THE HIGH SENSE THEY ENTERTAIN OF THOSE\r\n    EMINENT ABILITIES WHICH DISCOVERED AND THAT\r\n    DISINTERESTED PHILANTHROPY WHICH\r\n    PROMULGATED\r\n    THE VACCINE INOCULATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[119] Meaning thereby, as happened under Woodville at Battle Bridge\r\nHospital where Smallpox and Cowpox were incurred simultaneously.\r\n\r\n[120] _A Treatise on the Cowpox containing the History of Vaccine\r\nInoculation._ By John Ring.

London, 1801.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nA DISHONOURABLE TRANSFORMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nHonour was abundant, but honour is windy fare, and Jenner had an\r\neye for something more substantial. Among his papers we read--\r\n\r\n  While the vaccine discovery was progressive, the joy I felt at\r\n  the prospect before me of being the instrument destined to take\r\n  away from the world one of its greatest calamities, _blended with\r\n  the fond hope of enjoying independence_ and domestic peace and\r\n  happiness, was often so excessive that, in pursuing my favourite\r\n  subject among the meadows, I have sometimes found myself in a\r\n  kind of reverie. It is pleasant to me to recollect that these\r\n  reflections always ended in devout acknowledgments to that Being\r\n  from whom this and all other mercies flow.[124]\r\n\r\nBut how was the fond hope of enjoying independence to be realised?\r\nThe question was discussed by Jenner and his friends, and it was\r\nfinally decided to apply to the House of Commons for a reward. But\r\nin order to go to Parliament it was necessary to have a good case,\r\nand Jenner’s case was open to various objections. _The Inquiry_,\r\npublished in 1798, was by no means a manual of practice. Its\r\nprescription was Horsegrease Cowpox; but such Cowpox was neither\r\nproducible nor accounted tolerable. Cowpox that did not originate\r\nin Horsegrease, Jenner had adjudged spurious; and yet such spurious\r\nCowpox had been adopted by Pearson and Woodville, and under their\r\ninfluence had obtained extraordinary popularity. It was therefore\r\nby no means improbable that any claim for cash wherewith to enjoy\r\nindependence might be seriously contested. In this strait, what\r\nwas to be done? The question was a grave one, and called for a\r\nheroic solution. Resolved therefore, that Horsegrease Cowpox be\r\ndropped, and with it the use of escharotics for the subjugation of\r\nthe pustules produced thereby. Absolute silence should thenceforth\r\nbe his rule as to Horsegrease. So much for the negative position:\r\nthe positive was more difficult. To claim Cowpox as his own, with\r\nthe modes of its exhibition devised by Pearson, was an evolution\r\nfull of hazard, but unless prepared to surrender “the fond hope of\r\nenjoying independence,” it must be effected. He had advantages.\r\nHis name was associated with the new practice: even Pearson had\r\ndone him homage: neither the medical profession nor the public were\r\nlikely to study the _Inquiry_ critically, or to trouble their heads\r\nover obscure details: Cowpox was to them Cowpox: he had the world’s\r\near; and opposition would be set down as the ordinary behaviour of\r\nenvy toward success. Anyhow the transformation must be attempted:\r\notherwise, farewell to dreams of financial independence.\r\n\r\nTo initiate this transformation, Jenner came to London, and in May,\r\n1801, published a quarto pamphlet of twelve pages, entitled _The\r\nOrigin of the Vaccine Inoculation_.\r\n\r\nFirst it was necessary to represent that his investigations had\r\nextended over many years--a fact of which there was no sign in the\r\n_Inquiry_, the evidence indeed being distinctly otherwise; and thus\r\nhe shaped his statement--\r\n\r\n  My inquiry into the nature of the Cowpox commenced upwards of\r\n  twenty-five years ago. My attention to this singular disease\r\n  was first excited by observing that among those whom in the\r\n  country I was frequently called upon to inoculate, many resisted\r\n  every effort to give them the Smallpox. These patients I found\r\n  had undergone a disease they called the Cowpox, contracted by\r\n  milking Cows affected with a peculiar eruption on their teats.\r\n  On inquiry, it appeared it had been known among the dairies\r\n  from time immemorial, and that a vague opinion prevailed that\r\n  it was a preventive of the Smallpox. This opinion I found was\r\n  comparatively new among them; for all the older farmers declared\r\n  they had no such idea in their early days--a circumstance that\r\n  seemed easily to be accounted for, from my knowing that the\r\n  common people were very rarely inoculated for the Smallpox\r\n  till that practice was rendered general by the improved method\r\n  introduced by the Suttons: so that the working people in the\r\n  dairies were seldom put to the test of the preventive powers of\r\n  the Cowpox.\r\n\r\nJenner’s design in the foregoing statement was manifest. It was to\r\nminimise the faith of the country folk, and to represent that by\r\nhis own perspicacity he had discovered the virtue of Cowpox through\r\nhis failures to inoculate with Smallpox. The inquiries of Pearson\r\nand others, however, showed conclusively that in many parts of the\r\nsouth of England, in Ireland, and on the Continent it was believed\r\nthat to have suffered from Cowpox was to be secure from Smallpox;\r\nand the belief was entertained altogether independently of failures\r\nto inoculate with Smallpox; just as a similar belief prevailed\r\namong farriers as to the prophylaxy of Horsegrease. The faith\r\nin Cowpox was neither vague, nor new, nor confined to Jenner’s\r\nneighbourhood; and his assertion to the contrary showed with what\r\nhardihood he had undertaken to construct a case in his own favour.\r\n\r\nIn opposition to the rural faith, medical men maintained that it\r\nwas possible to have Smallpox after Cowpox; and surgeons averred\r\nthat they had successfully inoculated many who had suffered Cowpox.\r\nIndeed it was indubitable professional testimony to this effect\r\nthat compelled Jenner to forsake his first fancy for Cowpox,\r\nand to report the true specific as Horsegrease Cowpox. Having,\r\nhowever, to sacrifice that discovery, and revert to the Cowpox he\r\nhad discredited, a fresh manœuvre was requisite; and thus was it\r\nperformed--\r\n\r\n  In the course of the investigation I found that some of those\r\n  _who seemed to have undergone the Cowpox_, nevertheless, on\r\n  inoculation with the Smallpox, felt its influence just the same\r\n  as if no disease had been communicated to them by the Cow. This\r\n  occurrence led me to inquire among the medical practitioners in\r\n  the country around me, who all agreed in this sentiment, that\r\n  the Cowpox was not to be relied upon as a certain preventive of\r\n  the Smallpox. This for a while damped, but did not extinguish my\r\n  ardour; for as I proceeded I had the satisfaction to learn that\r\n  the Cow was subject to some varieties of spontaneous eruptions\r\n  upon her teats, that were all capable of communicating sores to\r\n  the hands of the milkers, and that whatever sore was derived\r\n  from the animal was called in the dairy the Cowpox. Thus I\r\n  surmounted a great obstacle, and, in consequence, was led to form\r\n  a distinction between these diseases, one of which only I have\r\n  denominated the _true_, the others the _spurious_ Cowpox, as they\r\n  possess no specific power over the constitution.\r\n\r\nHere we have the trick before us at the very point of\r\ntransformation. He consulted with medical practitioners, “who\r\nall agreed that Cowpox was not to be relied upon as a certain\r\npreventive of Smallpox.” True. What did he do next? He discovered\r\nthat what Cowpox did not prevent, the variety derived from\r\nHorsegrease did. Such was the original revelation of 1798. In 1801\r\nwe have a different story, and his quest a different issue. Not\r\na word about the discovery of the sure preventive in Horsegrease\r\nCowpox--not one word! Although his ardour was damped by the medical\r\nevidence against Cowpox, he yet prosecuted his inquiry; and to his\r\nsatisfaction ascertained that what the milkers called Cowpox was\r\nnot always Cowpox, but that any sores whatever derived from the\r\nCow were so designated. He therefore was led to form a distinction\r\nbetween the diseases, and to denominate one as _true_ and the\r\nothers as _spurious_ Cowpox.\r\n\r\nThus the Horse, the obnoxious Horse, was got rid of, and the\r\nCow represented as of herself yielding pox, which pox was the\r\nCowpox that Pearson and Woodville (in contempt of Jenner’s 1798\r\nrevelation) had brought into fashion; and which it had become all\r\nessential for Jenner to claim as his own in order to realise his\r\n“fond hope of enjoying independence.”\r\n\r\nIn this connection the question occurs, Why should “some varieties\r\nof spontaneous eruptions” have been designated _spurious_ Cowpox?\r\nSuch eruptions were not Cowpox in any sense. Why then spurious?\r\nThat Cows communicated a variety of sores to their milkers,\r\ndescribed by them in common as Cowpox, was an assertion for which\r\nJenner never adduced any evidence; which, too, (as we shall see)\r\nat a later date he disowned as a misapprehension. Nevertheless\r\nspurious Cowpox got the New Inoculation over many difficulties.\r\nWhen Smallpox, or any notable mischief, followed Cowpox it was\r\nsaid, “Ah! the Cowpox must have been spurious; for Smallpox, or\r\nany harm, is impossible after true Cowpox.” People did not stay to\r\ninquire whether spurious Cowpox (that was to say, matter “from a\r\nvariety of sores on the Cow,” according to Jenner’s second version)\r\ncould be propagated from arm-to-arm, even if taken from the Cow by\r\nmistake. The illusory Variolous Test and the Spurious Cowpox Dodge\r\nworked marvellously for the public deception.\r\n\r\nAnother point Jenner tried to score at the cost of Pearson and\r\nWoodville. When they began to inoculate they found they had to\r\nascertain at what period the virus should be taken from the Cow,\r\nand from the arms of the inoculated. Jenner afforded them no\r\nguidance. Writing to John Ring, 1st July, 1801, he confessed--\r\n\r\n  In the early part of my inoculations I had not learned to\r\n  discriminate between the efficacy of the virus taken at an early\r\n  and at a late period of the pustule.[125]\r\n\r\nWhere Jenner had not learned to discriminate, the line became clear\r\nin the course of general practice; and Pearson was especially\r\nexplicit as to the right time for taking virus; but to make good\r\nhis claim to national consideration, Jenner fancied it necessary\r\nto exhibit himself as complete master of the art of Cowpox\r\nInoculation, owing nothing to others; and he therefore proceeded to\r\nappropriate the fruit of the common medical experience, assigning\r\nit to a season when he alone was in the field. Referring to his\r\nseparation of true from spurious Cowpox, he thus prosecuted his\r\nraid--\r\n\r\n  This impediment to my progress was not long removed before\r\n  another, of far greater magnitude in appearance, started up.\r\n  There were not wanting instances to prove that when the true\r\n  Cowpox broke out among the cattle at a dairy, the person who\r\n  had milked an infected animal, and had thereby gone through the\r\n  disease in common with others, was liable to receive the Smallpox\r\n  afterwards. This, like the former obstacle, gave a painful check\r\n  to my fond and aspiring hopes; but reflecting that the operations\r\n  of Nature are generally uniform, and that it was not probable the\r\n  human constitution (having undergone the Cowpox) should in some\r\n  instances be perfectly shielded from the Smallpox, and in many\r\n  others remain unprotected, I resumed my labours with redoubled\r\n  ardour. The result was fortunate; for I now discovered that the\r\n  virus of Cowpox was liable to undergo progressive changes from\r\n  the same cause precisely as that of Smallpox, and that when\r\n  it was applied to the human skin in its degenerated state, it\r\n  would produce the ulcerated effects in as great a degree as when\r\n  it was not decomposed, and sometimes far greater; but having\r\n  lost its _specific properties_, it was incapable of producing\r\n  that change upon the human frame which is requisite to render\r\n  it insusceptible of the variolous contagion: so that it became\r\n  evident a person might milk a Cow one day, and having caught the\r\n  disease, _be for ever secure_; while another person, milking the\r\n  same Cow the next day, might feel the influence of the virus in\r\n  such a way as to produce a sore, or sores, and, in consequence of\r\n  this, might experience an indisposition to a considerable extent;\r\n  yet, as has been observed, the specific quality being lost, the\r\n  constitution would receive no peculiar impression....\r\n\r\n  This observation will fully explain the source of those errors\r\n  which have been committed by many inoculators of the Cowpox.\r\n  Conceiving the whole process to be extremely simple, as not to\r\n  admit of a mistake, they have been heedless about the state of\r\n  the Vaccine Virus; and finding it limpid, as part of it will\r\n  be, even in an advanced state of the pustule, they have felt an\r\n  improper confidence, and sometimes mistaken a spurious pustule\r\n  for that which possesses the perfect character.\r\n\r\nNo one apparently thought it worth while to expose the fictitious\r\ncharacter of these statements, invented by Jenner to justify his\r\npretensions and to baffle objections. Any careful reader of the\r\n_Inquiry_ of 1798, and the _Origin of Vaccine Inoculation_ of 1801,\r\ncannot fail to perceive the radical inconsistency of the earlier\r\nand later narratives, and how a few hasty experiments enveloped in\r\nunverifiable conjecture and gossip, came to be magnified into years\r\nof arduous research.\r\n\r\nHe wound up his statement with this flourish and prediction--\r\n\r\n  The distrust and scepticism which naturally arose in the minds of\r\n  medical men, on my first announcing so unexpected a discovery,\r\n  has now nearly disappeared. Many hundreds of them from actual\r\n  experience, have given their attestations that the inoculated\r\n  Cowpox proves a perfect security against the Smallpox; and I\r\n  shall probably be within compass if I say thousands are ready to\r\n  follow their example; for the scope that this Inoculation has now\r\n  taken is immense. An hundred thousand persons, upon the smallest\r\n  computation, have been inoculated in these realms. [May, 1801.]\r\n  The numbers who have partaken of its benefits throughout Europe\r\n  and other parts of the globe are incalculable; and it now becomes\r\n  too manifest to admit of controversy, that the annihilation of\r\n  the Smallpox, the most dreadful scourge of the human species,\r\n  must be the final result of this practice.\r\n\r\nFor the end designed--to establish and exalt a claim with the\r\npurpose of exacting corresponding recompense, the _Origin of the\r\nVaccine Inoculation_ was an adroitly drawn document: its veracity\r\nis a different matter. A just man, not to say a generous, would\r\nhave had some praise for Pearson, Woodville, and others to whom\r\nthe extension of the New Inoculation was due; but Jenner was\r\nessentially a mean spirit; and for him to have stated his case\r\ntruly would have been to jeopardise “the fond hope of enjoying\r\nindependence.”\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[124] Baron’s _Life of Jenner_, vol. i., p. 140.\r\n\r\n[125] Baron’s _Life of Jenner_, vol. i., p. 448.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nJENNER BEFORE PARLIAMENT, 1802.\r\n\r\n\r\nJenner was timid and indolent, and, though eager for reward,\r\nrequired much prompting to use the means to the end on which his\r\nheart was set. He wrote to Lord Sherborne to speak for him to Prime\r\nMinister Addington; but Sherborne replied, 23rd April, 1801, that\r\nhe did not know Addington even by sight. He would however try to\r\nsee Mr. Pitt, adding for encouragement and direction--\r\n\r\n  If patriot Grattan gets £50,000 for his patriotism, the true\r\n  patriot Jenner deserves more: I am sure not less; and less would\r\n  be perfectly shabby to think of. I perfectly recollect Grattan’s\r\n  business. It was settled among his friends to propose £100,000\r\n  for him, determining to ask enough; and fearing that sum would\r\n  not be granted, one of his particular friends was to get up\r\n  afterwards and propose £50,000, which was immediately granted,\r\n  and he took £47,500 for prompt payment.\r\n\r\nAction had to be taken, and on 9th December, 1801, Jenner went to\r\nLondon to prepare a petition to the House of Commons and to canvass\r\nfor support. Even at the last moment, Wilberforce had to warn him,\r\n24th February, 1802, that no time was to be lost, or he would lose\r\nhis chance for the year. After prolonged consultation with those\r\naccustomed to such business, the petition was got ready, and on\r\n17th March, 1802, it was presented to the House of Commons.\r\n\r\n  The humble Petition of EDWARD JENNER, Doctor of Physic,\r\n\r\n    SHEWETH,\r\n\r\n  That your Petitioner having discovered that a disease which\r\n  occasionally exists in a particular form among cattle, known by\r\n  the name of the Cowpox, admits of being inoculated on the human\r\n  frame with the most perfect ease and safety, and is attended with\r\n  the singularly beneficial effect of rendering through life the\r\n  persons so inoculated perfectly secure from the infection of the\r\n  Smallpox.\r\n\r\n  That your Petitioner after a most attentive and laborious\r\n  investigation of the subject, setting aside considerations of\r\n  private and personal advantage, and anxious to promote the\r\n  safety and welfare of his Countrymen and of Mankind in general,\r\n  did not wish to conceal the Discovery he so made of the mode\r\n  of conducting this new species of Inoculation, but immediately\r\n  disclosed the whole to the public; and by communication with\r\n  medical men in all parts of this Kingdom, and in Foreign\r\n  Countries, sedulously endeavoured to spread the knowledge of his\r\n  discovery and the benefit of his labours as widely as possible.\r\n\r\n  That in this latter respect the views and wishes of your\r\n  Petitioner have been completely fulfilled; for to his high\r\n  gratification he has to say that this Inoculation is in practice\r\n  throughout a great proportion of the civilised world, and has in\r\n  particular been productive of great advantage to these Kingdoms,\r\n  in consequence of its being introduced, under authority, into the\r\n  Army and Navy.\r\n\r\n  That the said Inoculation hath already checked the progress of\r\n  the Smallpox, and from its nature must finally annihilate that\r\n  dreadful disorder.\r\n\r\n  That the series of experiments by which this discovery was\r\n  developed and completed have not only occupied a considerable\r\n  portion of your Petitioner’s life, and have not merely been\r\n  a cause of great expense and anxiety to him, but have so\r\n  interrupted him in the ordinary exercise of his profession as\r\n  materially to abridge its pecuniary advantages without their\r\n  being counter balanced by those derived from the new practice.\r\n\r\n    Your Petitioner, therefore, with the full persuasion that\r\n    he shall meet with that attention and indulgence of which\r\n    this Honourable House may deem him worthy, humbly prays this\r\n    Honourable House to take the premises into consideration, and\r\n    to grant him such remuneration as to their wisdom shall seem\r\n    meet.\r\n\r\nPatriot Grattan asked for £100,000, was awarded £50,000, and took\r\n£47,500: “true patriot Jenner deserves more,” said Lord Sherborne;\r\nbut Jenner had not courage for the demand. What, however, was\r\nundefined in cash was made up for in pretension.\r\n\r\nAs we read Jenner’s petition we note (1) the Discovery; (2) its\r\nDisclosure and Diffusion; (3) the Expense thereby incurred; and (4)\r\nthe Prophecies; and under these heads it is to be observed--\r\n\r\n1.--It was no discovery of Jenner’s that cowpox was inoculable and\r\npreventive of smallpox. That was a rural superstition. Nor, be\r\nit again repeated, did he ever become responsible for that rural\r\nsuperstition. Recognising its futility, he deliberately set it\r\naside, and recommended a disease of the horse, transmitted through\r\nthe cow, for inoculation. It was Pearson, who disliking Jenner’s\r\nprescription, brought cowpox into vogue; whereon Jenner, fearing\r\nthat he might be cut out of the enterprise, dropped his specific,\r\nadopted the cowpox he had rejected, and claimed Pearson’s work as\r\nthe development of his own.\r\n\r\n2.--That he disclosed his discovery was true, but it was not\r\nthe discovery set forth in the petition. Moreover the merit\r\nof disclosure in such a case is measured by the advantage of\r\nconcealment; and what could Jenner have taken by concealment? The\r\nconditions of successful quackery were not present in the secret\r\npractice of inoculation with horsegrease cowpox.\r\n\r\n3.--That the discovery occupied a considerable portion of Jenner’s\r\nlife, and was attended with great expense and loss of practice, is\r\nanswered by reference to his _Inquiry_. With what loss of time,\r\nloss of money, and loss of practice could the series of cases\r\ntherein set forth have been attended? And after 1798, he confessed\r\nhe was able to achieve little further.\r\n\r\n4.--As for the prophecies about the absolute security afforded\r\nby cowpox with the final extermination of smallpox, we may\r\nestimate the worth of such vapouring by the asserted check at\r\nthat time, 1801, administered to the disease, when as yet an\r\ninsignificant fraction of the population had been subjected to the\r\nNew Inoculation, and a fraction, too, least likely to suffer from\r\nsmallpox.\r\n\r\nPetitions are petitions, and not designed for over-much scrutiny.\r\nIn them truth is rarely to be looked for otherwise than warped\r\nto personal ends. The policy of a petition is to claim in excess\r\nwith a view to obtain a larger concession. Jenner’s petition was\r\na more than usually flagrant instance of this policy, with the\r\ndisadvantage that much of its untruth passed into currency as\r\nmatter of fact.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister, Mr. ADDINGTON (afterwards Viscount Sidmouth),\r\ninformed the House that he had taken the King’s pleasure on the\r\ncontents of the petition, and that his Majesty recommended it\r\nstrongly to the consideration of Parliament. It was referred to a\r\ncommittee, of which Admiral Berkeley, a zealous believer in Jenner,\r\nwas appointed chairman. The points to which the committee chiefly\r\ndirected their inquiries were--\r\n\r\nI.--The utility of the discovery itself.\r\n\r\nII.--The right of the petitioner to the discovery.\r\n\r\nIII.--The sacrifices of the petitioner in making the discovery.\r\n\r\nAs an investigation the work of the Committee was illusory. The\r\npoints were decided in the petitioner’s favour from the outset.\r\nThere was no opposition. Dr. Moseley, Mr. Birch, and Dr. Rowley,\r\nwho became active opponents of the New Inoculation, were summoned,\r\nbut the matter was new to them; they had not had time to collect\r\nevidence and formulate conclusions: a rite that was to protect for\r\na lifetime and to annihilate smallpox, announced in 1798, was to be\r\nadjudicated upon in 1802! On the other hand, Jenner’s friends were\r\ninfluential and active, and used the opportunity to parade their\r\nwhole strength in his favour. The medical testimony especially was\r\nunreserved and enthusiastic.\r\n\r\nDr. JAMES SIMS, president of the London Medical Society, laid\r\nbefore the Committee a unanimous resolution of the Society in\r\nJenner’s favour. He said he was at first adverse to Vaccine\r\nInoculation, but his confidence in it was increasing every hour.\r\nIt introduced no other disease to the human frame, whilst it made\r\nan end of the possibility of smallpox, a disease that proved fatal\r\nto one in six of those it attacked. He had never heard of Cowpox\r\nbefore the publication of _The Inquiry_, and regarded the discovery\r\ntherein communicated as the most useful ever made in medicine. If\r\nJenner had kept and traded on his secret, he might have become the\r\nrichest man in the kingdom.\r\n\r\nSir GILBERT BLANE related how the New Inoculation had been\r\nintroduced to the Navy. He had had the men on board the _Kent_,\r\nman-of-war, inoculated with cowpox, and then with smallpox, and\r\nnot one took the latter disease. Of every thousand deaths in the\r\ncountry, smallpox was accountable for ninety-five. Taking London\r\nas the standard, 45,000 must perish annually from smallpox in the\r\nUnited Kingdom. As soon as the preventive discovered by Jenner\r\nbecame universal that large mortality would cease.\r\n\r\nDr. LETTSOM, a popular physician, a member of the Society of\r\nFriends, and an enthusiastic supporter of Jenner, said he had\r\npaid much attention to smallpox statistics. Taking London and\r\nthe out-parishes as containing nearly 1,000,000 inhabitants, he\r\ncalculated that eight a day, or 3000 annually died of smallpox.\r\nAllowing Great Britain and Ireland to have a population of\r\n12,000,000, that would give a mortality of not less than 36,000 per\r\nannum from smallpox. He had reason to conclude that about 60,000\r\npersons had undergone the New Inoculation up to date. He did not\r\nthink that the genuine cowpox when inoculated could ever prove\r\nfatal. Had Jenner kept his remedy secret he might have derived\r\nimmense pecuniary profits from it, as did the Suttons by their\r\nimproved practice of variolous inoculation.\r\n\r\nAsked whether he had known any inoculated with smallpox\r\nsubsequently contract smallpox, he replied that he had two\r\nrelatives inoculated who afterwards had smallpox, and one of them\r\ndied. He had recently attended two families, in each of which\r\na child inoculated was laid up a year after the operation with\r\nsmallpox.\r\n\r\nDr. WOODVILLE, forgiving Jenner’s evil treatment, came, like a\r\ngood Friend, to bear witness to the new practice. He had learnt\r\nto prefer vaccine to variolous inoculation at the Hospital. He\r\nhad, up to January, 1802, operated with cowpox on 7,500 patients.\r\nAbout half of them had been subjected to the Variolous Test with\r\nsatisfactory results.\r\n\r\nDr. BRADLEY, physician to the Westminster Hospital, said he looked\r\non Jenner as the author of Vaccine Inoculation, and believed no\r\nmedical man doubted it. As accidental inoculation with cowpox was\r\nproved to keep off smallpox for life, it was matter of course that\r\nintentional inoculation would do so also. Not less than 2,000,000\r\nof persons had received Vaccine Inoculation, and he had never known\r\nan instance of any one dying of it. One in 300 died of smallpox\r\ninoculation in England, and not less than one in 150 throughout\r\nthe rest of Europe, Asia, Africa and America. Had Jenner settled\r\nin London he might have made £10,000 per annum for the first five\r\nyears, and double that sum afterwards.\r\n\r\nSir WALTER FARQUHAR, physician to the Prince of Wales, had told\r\nJenner that if he had come to London and kept his secret, he would\r\nhave ensured him £10,000 a year. He had however divulged his\r\nsecret and lost all chance of emolument. His remedy was a permanent\r\nsecurity against smallpox, and had never proved fatal; whilst\r\nvariolous inoculation, performed in the best manner, cost one life\r\nin three hundred.\r\n\r\nMr. CLINE, surgeon to St. Thomas’s Hospital, corroborated the\r\nopinion that Jenner could have earned £10,000 a year in London by\r\nmeans of his secret. As smallpox was the most destructive of all\r\ndiseases, its suppression was the greatest discovery ever made in\r\nthe practice of physic.\r\n\r\nMr. JOHN GRIFFITHS, surgeon to the Queen’s Household and St.\r\nGeorge’s Hospital, had inoculated upwards of 1500 persons with\r\ncowpox without any untoward symptoms.\r\n\r\nMr. JAMES SIMPSON, surgeon to the Surrey Dispensary, had inoculated\r\nbetween fifty and sixty without any injury. Considered them\r\nperfectly secure from smallpox. A child of nine months covered with\r\n_crusta lactea_ resisted all the usual remedies, but on the tenth\r\nday after he had inoculated it with cowpox, the crust began to\r\ndisappear, and the twelfth day was entirely gone.\r\n\r\nDr. JOSEPH MARSHALL related his experience as a vaccine inoculator\r\nin the Navy and at Gibraltar, Malta, Palermo, Naples, Rome and\r\nGenoa. Everywhere was successful. Believed he had operated on\r\n10,000, and never witnessed any ill consequences whatever. On the\r\ncontrary, children in a weak state of health, after passing through\r\nthe vaccine infection, began to thrive and become vigorous.\r\n\r\nMr. JOHN ADDINGTON, surgeon, had used Jenner’s remedy since 1799\r\nin eighty-one cases. One third of these he had inoculated with\r\nsmallpox, and subjected to every method of infection he could\r\ndevise, but found them perfectly proof against the disease.\r\n\r\nDr. SKEY, physician to the Worcester Hospital, testified that\r\nin the spring of 1801 smallpox was epidemic in Worcester. He\r\ninoculated a number of children with cowpox, and none of them took\r\nsmallpox although constantly exposed to contagion.\r\n\r\nDr. THORNTON, physician to the Marylebone Dispensary, had\r\ninoculated a patient with cowpox, and afterwards with smallpox at\r\ntwelve different times during the past three years without effect.\r\nHe had even slept with a person in natural smallpox, who died, but\r\ntook no harm. When at Lord Lonsdale’s in the North he had operated\r\non upwards of a thousand, and had completely satisfied himself, and\r\nall the medical practitioners in that part of England, that cowpox\r\nwas a mild disease, hardly deserving the name of a disease. It was\r\nnot contagious; it never disfigured the person, never produced\r\nblindness, nor excited other diseases. It was equally safe whether\r\nduring the period of pregnancy, or the earliest infancy, or extreme\r\nold age.\r\n\r\nDr. BAILLIE then gave his influential judgment. He thought cowpox\r\nan extremely mild disease, and when a patient had properly\r\nundergone it, he was perfectly secure from the future infection\r\nof smallpox: and further, if Dr. Jenner had not chosen openly and\r\nhonourably to explain to the public all he knew upon the subject,\r\nhe might have acquired a considerable fortune. In his opinion it\r\nwas the most important discovery ever made in medicine.\r\n\r\nMr. DAVID TAYLOR, surgeon of Wootton-under-Edge, had inoculated\r\nabout two thousand persons with cowpox without a single\r\nfailure, nor had he met with any ulcerations, tumours, or other\r\ndiseases following the operation. He knew Jenner’s practice in\r\nGloucestershire. It was in a very populous neighbourhood where\r\nthere was not another physician within sixteen miles. He had\r\nsurrendered an income of £600 a year to devote himself to the\r\npublic service.\r\n\r\nAs a final specimen of this medical evidence I may cite Mr. JOHN\r\nRING, the petitioner’s henchman. He considered Jenner the author of\r\nVaccine Inoculation, a discovery the most valuable and important\r\never made by man. It was a perfect and permanent security against\r\nsmallpox. He had himself inoculated about 1200, of whom a thousand\r\nhad exposed themselves to smallpox infection with impunity.\r\nThere was no danger whatever from the New Inoculation unless\r\nfrom ignorance and neglect. One in every hundred inoculated with\r\nsmallpox in London died, owing to the unwholesome atmosphere and\r\nthe necessity of operating on children at an improper age. If\r\nJenner had kept his discovery to himself he might have made £10,000\r\na year by it; for others had got as much or more by the practice of\r\nphysic.\r\n\r\nThis evidence, better than any secondary description, will enable\r\nthe reader to appreciate the prevalent furore as it affected the\r\nleaders of the medical world. At the same time it is to be borne\r\nin mind that the craze was superficial. Any radical change in\r\nconviction or practice is never accomplished thus easily or thus\r\nrapidly. The medical men who bore witness for cowpox had been bred\r\nto inoculation with smallpox, for which cowpox was substituted. The\r\nchange was essentially trivial. The trouble, the danger, and the\r\nuncertainty of variolous inoculation were generally recognised,\r\nand when cowpox was recommended as a mild form of smallpox, it was\r\nnot difficult to appreciate the asserted advantage: for, as it was\r\nargued, no one can have smallpox twice, and as the mildest attack\r\nof smallpox is as prohibitive of a second attack as the severest,\r\ntherefore cowpox (which is smallpox in mild form) must protect as\r\neffectually when inoculated. With logic so admirable, it was in\r\nnowise wonderful that so many were carried away; but unfortunately,\r\nas so often happens, matter-of-fact did not correspond to the\r\nadmirable logic.\r\n\r\nThe DUKE OF CLARENCE testified that he had availed himself of\r\nJenner’s discovery from the outset. His children, his household and\r\nfarm servants were all protected. A postillion positively refused\r\nto be operated on, and eighteen months after he caught smallpox\r\nin the most virulent form. Children who had undergone cowpox were\r\nconstantly in the room where the lad lay and suffered no harm.\r\n\r\nThe EARL OF BERKELEY had his son inoculated with cowpox by Dr.\r\nJenner at the age of six months. One of his maid-servants took\r\nsmallpox and died, and the effluvia during her illness was so\r\noffensive that his servants had to move to another part of the\r\nhouse. To test the reality of his son’s protection, he sent\r\nfor Jenner, and got him to inoculate the boy with pox from the\r\nmaid. The child was found to be proof, for the inoculation had\r\nno effect--To illustrate the validity of the Gloucestershire\r\ntradition, he related how a man of 72 in his service had caught\r\ncowpox when a boy of 15 whilst milking, and in consequence always\r\nreckoned himself secure from smallpox, exposing himself to the\r\ndisease with complete indifference.\r\n\r\nLORD ROUS gave similar evidence. His child had been inoculated with\r\ncowpox at the age of three months, and he was perfectly satisfied\r\nthat he could never have smallpox.\r\n\r\nThen there were lay practitioners, of whom Jenner’s nephew, the\r\nRev. G. C. JENNER, may be taken as an example. He bore witness that\r\nhe had inoculated 3000 with cowpox without a single unfavourable\r\ncase, from the earliest infancy to eighty years of age, and under\r\ncircumstances in which it would not be prudent to use variolous\r\nvirus; as, for example, children during teething and women in every\r\nstage of pregnancy. Upwards of two hundred of his patients had been\r\nafterwards inoculated with smallpox matter, and an equal number\r\nexposed to variolous effluvia, and in no instance did smallpox\r\nensue. He was satisfied that as soon as the new practice became\r\nuniversal, smallpox would be annihilated.\r\n\r\nAn early date being wanted for “the discovery,” EDWARD GARDNER,\r\nwine and spirit dealer, was brought from Gloucester to affirm that\r\nhe had known Jenner for more than twenty-two years, and had been in\r\nthe constant habit of hearing his medical opinions and discoveries.\r\nIt was in the month of May, 1780, that Jenner first informed him\r\nconcerning the nature of cowpox as a sure preventive of smallpox,\r\nand of the theory he had formed on the subject; declaring his\r\nfull and perfect confidence that the virus might be continued\r\nin perpetuity from one human being to another until smallpox was\r\nextinguished.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to stigmatise Gardner’s testimony afresh. It\r\npossibly had its foundation in Jenner discussing the familiar rural\r\nfaith in cowpox. Sir EVERARD HOME mentioned to the Committee that\r\nJenner had brought a drawing to London in 1788 of Variolæ Vaccinæ\r\nas it appeared on the finger of a milker, and had shown it to John\r\nHunter, who advised him to look further into the matter; but it was\r\nnot pretended that he spoke to Hunter of the matured conviction\r\nrevealed to Gardner eight years before.\r\n\r\nThe Committee heard evidence as to the knowledge and use of cowpox\r\napart from Jenner, and their verdict was given as follows--\r\n\r\n  The disorder itself, and its specific property of securing\r\n  against Smallpox infection, _was not a discovery of Dr.\r\n  Jenner’s_; for in various parts of England, in Gloucestershire\r\n  and Devonshire particularly, there was an opinion of that sort\r\n  current among the common people employed in dairies, which\r\n  the observations of the inoculators for the Smallpox tended\r\n  to confirm. It appears not improbable that in some very rare\r\n  instances this knowledge was carried one step farther, and that\r\n  the Cowpox was communicated either by handling the teat, or\r\n  by inoculation from the animal, for the purpose and with the\r\n  intention of securing against the danger of Smallpox; but the\r\n  practice of which Dr. Jenner asserts himself to be the original\r\n  Inventor is, the inoculation from one human being to another, and\r\n  the mode of transferring indefinitely, the vaccine matter without\r\n  any diminution of its specific power, to which it does not appear\r\n  that any person has ever alleged a title.\r\n\r\nThus the Committee disallowed Jenner’s claim, whilst indicating the\r\nonly colourable point of novelty, namely, the transfer from arm to\r\narm of virus. At the same time, it should not be forgotten that\r\ninoculation from arm to arm with “mild kinds of smallpox” was an\r\nexisting practice, and there was little merit to speak of in Jenner\r\ndoing the same thing with horse or cowpox.\r\n\r\nThere was no opposition--no devil’s advocate; but it may be held\r\nthat Dr. Pearson assumed that office. He was heard with impatience,\r\nand afterwards delivered his mind in _An Examination_, to which we\r\nshall presently refer.\r\n\r\nThe Report to the House was brought up on the 2nd of June, 1802,\r\nand was conclusive as to the utility of the discovery. Indeed, the\r\nevidence on that head was only cut short because it threatened\r\nto be interminable. The judgment of the Committee reiterated\r\nthe common persuasion--“As soon as the New Inoculation becomes\r\nuniversal, _it must absolutely extinguish_ one of the most\r\ndestructive disorders by which the human race has been visited.”\r\n\r\nAdmiral BERKELEY, chairman of the Committee, commended the Report\r\nto the House. He considered the discovery as unquestionably the\r\ngreatest ever made for the preservation of the human species. _It\r\nwas proved_ that in the United Kingdom 45,000 perished annually\r\nfrom smallpox; but throughout the world what was the desolation!\r\nNot a second struck but a victim was sacrificed at the altar of\r\nthat most horrible of diseases. He should therefore move that a sum\r\nof not less than £10,000 be granted to the Petitioner, but if the\r\nHouse thought fit to adopt any larger sum, he should hold himself\r\nfree to vote for it. Why, Dr. Jenner’s expenses in postage alone\r\nhad been from 25s. to 30s. a day!\r\n\r\nSir HENRY MILDMAY did not think £10,000 at all adequate. Had Jenner\r\nkept his secret he might have made at least £100,000. He moved that\r\nhe should have £20,000.\r\n\r\nMr. WINDHAM said the petitioner had surrendered his discovery\r\nto his country, and was therefore entitled to remuneration. The\r\ndiscovery had been the labour of years and the fruit of extensive\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nSir JAMES SINCLAIR ERSKINE was assured that Jenner had expended\r\n£6000 in the propagation of his discovery, and if he had £10,000,\r\nhe would be left with no more than £4000. Besides, he had given up\r\na practice of £600 a year to benefit his fellow-creatures.\r\n\r\nMr. COURTNEY observed that the evidence showed that 40,000 men\r\nwould be annually preserved to the State by the New Inoculation.\r\nThese would return £200,000 a year to the Exchequer, and if the\r\nPetitioner had only a tithe of that sum for one year, he was\r\nentitled to £20,000.\r\n\r\nMr. WILBERFORCE stated that Jenner had spent upwards of twenty\r\nyears in completing his discovery. He was no adventurer seeking to\r\npush himself before the world. He had already attained to great\r\ncelebrity in his profession, and had sacrificed his practice for\r\nthe public good. In every view he thought the larger sum ought to\r\nbe granted.\r\n\r\nMr. GREY thought £10,000 would be no more than an indemnity for\r\nexpenses. He hoped the House would vote for £20,000.\r\n\r\nMr. BANKS said there was no question as to the utility of the\r\ndiscovery. If he felt more niggardly than other members, it was\r\nbecause his paramount duty consisted in guarding the public purse.\r\nThat purse was a large one, but it was not to be dipped into at\r\npleasure. The strength of the country lay in economy and sound\r\nfinance. He did not see that a case had been made out for so large\r\na sum as £10,000. The discovery itself might be trusted to pay its\r\nauthor. He always looked on a Report of a Committee with jealousy,\r\nfor it was controlled by the friends of the Petitioner, and there\r\nwas no one with sufficient motive to provide the correctives\r\nrequired in the public interest.\r\n\r\nMr. ADDINGTON, Chancellor of the Exchequer, held that the value of\r\nthe discovery was without example, and beyond calculation. So much,\r\nindeed, was not contested. The Petitioner had received the highest\r\nreward in the approbation, the unanimous approbation of the House;\r\nan approbation richly deserved, since it was the result of _the\r\ngreatest discovery since the creation of man_. Whatever money the\r\nHouse might see fit to vote on some future occasion, his present\r\nduty was to recommend the smaller sum of £10,000. In doing so, he\r\nadmitted, he surrendered his private inclination to his sense of\r\npublic duty. He had, however, the satisfaction in knowing that this\r\ndiscussion had conferred on Dr. Jenner a reward that would endure\r\nfor ever, whilst the comfort of his family would be amply ensured\r\nin the extension of practice that would follow the approbation of\r\nthe House.\r\n\r\nThe question was then put that the words £10,000 do stand part\r\nof the resolution; when the Committee divided--Ayes 59, Noes 56,\r\nMajority 3.\r\n\r\nThe discussion in the House of Commons shows how wide was the\r\ngeneral craze. Facts and figures were evolved at discretion and\r\nrepeated indiscriminately. To rave about Jenner, the saviour from\r\nsmallpox, was the mode. It was as if all had consented to go mad\r\ntogether. Mr. Dunning, a surgeon, otherwise rational, broke into\r\nprophetic fury--\r\n\r\n  With pride, with just and national pride, we boast a Newton and\r\n  a Harvey; posterity will boast a Jenner![126]\r\n\r\nConsidering the value set on “the great discovery,” the award of\r\n£10,000 was not excessive. In the _Medical Journal_ it stands\r\nrecorded--\r\n\r\n  We have never witnessed a more unanimous and general\r\n  disappointment than that which has been expressed, not only by\r\n  the profession, but by the public at large, at the smallness of\r\n  the remuneration.[127]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is to be remembered that the times were\r\ndark and hard, cruelly hard, through war and scanty harvests; the\r\nquartern loaf selling at 1s. 11d., a significant index of the\r\npeople’s misery.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[126] _Medical Journal_, January, 1802.\r\n\r\n[127] _Ib._ July, 1802.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nPEARSON’S _EXAMINATION_.[128]\r\n\r\n\r\nA few weeks after the award of £10,000 to Jenner by the House of\r\nCommons, Dr. Pearson published _An Examination_ of the report of\r\nthe committee. He did not contest Jenner’s claim to consideration,\r\nbut the ground on which it was advanced, and on which it was\r\nconceded; drawing attention to the manner in which the claims set\r\nforth in Jenner’s petition had been reduced to “inoculation from\r\none human being to another,” whilst a new claim was invented for\r\nhim, “to wit, the mode of transferring, indefinitely, the vaccine\r\nmatter without any diminution of its specific power.”\r\n\r\nWhat Pearson held, and rightly held, was, that the public\r\nacceptance of the New Inoculation was due to Woodville and himself,\r\nand not to Jenner--\r\n\r\n  The Cowpock Inoculation (after Dr. Jenner’s book was published\r\n  in June, 1798, which contained seven or eight cases, the whole\r\n  result of his experience) was not practised by any person that I\r\n  know of, till January, 1799, neither Dr. Jenner, nor any person\r\n  that I could find being in possession of matter; but, in January,\r\n  1799, in consequence of a general inquiry, which I had instituted\r\n  immediately after Jenner’s publication, information was given\r\n  of the Cowpock Disease breaking out in two Cow-stables near\r\n  London, and from these sources Dr. Woodville and myself collected\r\n  matter, by which, in the course of three months, 300 persons (not\r\n  fewer, I think) were inoculated for the Cowpock in addition to\r\n  the seven or eight cases of Dr. Jenner, then the whole stock of\r\n  facts of Inoculation before the public. Besides carrying on the\r\n  Inoculation ourselves in this manner, we disseminated the matter\r\n  throughout the country, in particular to Dr. Jenner himself; and\r\n  especially, I within that time issued a printed letter, directed\r\n  to upwards of two hundred practitioners in different parts of\r\n  the kingdom, containing thread impregnated with the Cowpock\r\n  matter.... By the close of 1799 about 4000 persons had been\r\n  inoculated by Dr. Woodville, myself, and our correspondents.\r\n\r\nPearson also claimed to have cleared away difficulties created by\r\nJenner’s statements, some of which were most prejudicial to the\r\npublic acceptance of the New Inoculation--\r\n\r\n  I published experiments of inoculating persons with the Cowpock\r\n  to show that _they could not take the Cowpock after the\r\n  Smallpox_, contrary to Dr. Jenner. Secondly, experiments to\r\n  show that persons could not take the Cowpock who had already\r\n  gone through the Cowpock, also contrary to Dr. Jenner.[129]\r\n  Thirdly, many persons had at this period made experiments to\r\n  show that _the Cowpox did not originate in the grease of Horses’\r\n  heels_, as Dr. Jenner had asserted. In the spring of 1799, a\r\n  second publication appeared from Dr. Jenner recommending caustic\r\n  or escharotics to the inoculated parts in Cowpox, which we\r\n  found wholly unnecessary in practice; and I consider that the\r\n  distinctive characters of the Cowpock were better understood by\r\n  some of us than by Dr. Jenner himself.\r\n\r\nOne can only say of these statements of Pearson as against Jenner,\r\nthat they are simple matters of fact, impugn them whoso list. It is\r\nimpossible to controvert Pearson’s assertion--\r\n\r\n  That the whole of Jenner’s experience extended to seven or eight\r\n  cases, and a part only of these--namely, four--were from human\r\n  subject to human subject; and not until long after Dr. Woodville\r\n  and myself had published several hundred instances of vaccine\r\n  virus transmitted from arm to arm, had he any experiments to set\r\n  alongside ours.\r\n\r\nThey had to find out for themselves when to take virus from the\r\ncow, how to preserve it when taken, how to dress inoculated arms,\r\nwhen to take virus from the arm, and, in short, to do everything\r\nthat constitutes the difference between a suggestion and an art.\r\n\r\nPearson, too, as we have seen, had a leading part in the formation\r\nof the first Institution for the Inoculation of the Vaccine Pock,\r\nwith which Jenner had not only nothing to do, but _would_ have\r\nnothing to do: concerning which wrote Pearson--\r\n\r\n  The Vaccine Inoculation was next considerably established by\r\n  the Cowpock Institution, of which I was one of the founders,\r\n  commencing at the close of 1799; which Institution has been the\r\n  principal office for the supplying the world in general, and the\r\n  Army and Navy in particular, with matter; and where a regular\r\n  register is kept of each of the cases inoculated.\r\n\r\nAs to Jenner keeping the secret of Cowpox and making a great\r\nfortune out of it, Pearson replied, first, that he had not proved\r\nhis remedy; second, that he would have had to persuade the public\r\nto believe in him; and, third, that too much was known about Cowpox\r\nto have made a secret possible. Moreover, the assertion that he\r\nmight have earned £10,000 a year and a fortune of £150,000 was\r\nabsurd--\r\n\r\n  Such a fortune no one ever acquired by physic in this or any\r\n  other country--far exceeding the greatest ever known, those of\r\n  Sir Theodore Mayerne in the first half of the 17th century, and\r\n  of the still greater one of Dr. Ratcliffe in the early part of\r\n  last century.\r\n\r\nWhen it was further said, that experiments in Vaccine Inoculation\r\nhad occupied twenty years of Jenner’s life, that they had cost him\r\n£6000, and that he had surrendered a practice of £600 a year in the\r\npopulous neighbourhood of Berkeley for the public benefit--he would\r\nnot trust himself to characterise the allegations.\r\n\r\nHis own position, Pearson thus defined--\r\n\r\n  I have admitted that Dr. Jenner first set on foot the inquiry\r\n  into the advantages of Vaccine Inoculation; but I apprehend\r\n  that the practice has been established almost entirely by other\r\n  practitioners; and that his new facts, or which I consider to be\r\n  new, have been, in my opinion, disproved by subsequent observers;\r\n  and that in consequence of those facts being disproved, together\r\n  with the very ample experiences of other persons, we owe the\r\n  present extensive practice of the Vaccine Inoculation.\r\n\r\nPearson further indicated on what conditions he would have been\r\nsatisfied to see Jenner rewarded--\r\n\r\n  A much more dignified and more just ground of claim, and an\r\n  equally favourable one for remuneration, would have been in\r\n  terms denoting that the Petitioner had proposed a new kind of\r\n  Inoculation, and actually furnished some instances of the success\r\n  of it, founded upon facts; of which some were brought to light\r\n  and use, which heretofore had only been locally known to a very\r\n  small number of persons; and others were discoveries of the\r\n  Author: further, that in consequence of considerable subsequent\r\n  investigation, by the Author and others, such a body of evidence\r\n  had been obtained, and such further facts had been discovered, as\r\n  demonstrated the advantages of the new practice.\r\n\r\nWhilst willing that Jenner should be rewarded, for Woodville and\r\nfor himself, Pearson wanted nothing: he simply maintained that the\r\njudgment of the House of Commons Committee should have recognised\r\nthe facts of the situation. He observed--\r\n\r\n  I have some authority for stating that the members of the\r\n  Committee _did not unanimously_ think such exclusive claims were\r\n  just. I had some reason to expect that the representation of\r\n  the Committee in their Report would have been such as to have\r\n  satisfied the expectations, not exorbitant, of Dr. Woodville\r\n  and myself; such as would have cost the Petitioner nothing, _to\r\n  wit_, a mere acknowledgment of services. The most unqualified and\r\n  exclusive claims having been decreed, this bounty of course has\r\n  been withheld, either because it was judged to be not owing, or\r\n  from some other motive which I will not name; but it is fitting\r\n  that I disclaim any insinuation of unworthy motives actuating\r\n  those with whom judgment was invested.\r\n\r\nConsidering the injustice to which Pearson had been subjected,\r\nand the provocation he had received, it is impossible to refrain\r\nfrom admiration of the serene and impartial temper in which he\r\ncomposed his _Examination_. Had he sat as judge between Jenner and\r\nhimself, he could not have stated the case with greater accuracy\r\nand absence of bias. He fell into no exaggeration; he indulged in\r\nno sarcasm; he descended to no abuse. He set forth the incidents\r\nof the New Inoculation with the imperial simplicity and dignity\r\nof truth. Where others had gone crazed, he preserved some degree\r\nof sanity. He held it to be premature to proclaim the extinction\r\nof Smallpox, or to say with Jenner that reports of failure and\r\ninjury from inoculated Cowpox were beneath contempt. It was only\r\ntime and experience that could warrant such absolute assertion and\r\nprediction.\r\n\r\nIt is said that in hurricanes of panic or enthusiasm, wise men go\r\nhome and keep quiet until the sky clears, resistance being folly.\r\nFor immediate effect resistance may be folly, but the protest of\r\ntruth is sometimes imperative, whatever the disposition of the mob.\r\nPearson took little at the time by his _Examination_: it entered\r\ninto far too many details for general apprehension; and it was\r\nconvenient to account for his opposition as due to jealousy and\r\nenvy. Jenner attempted no reply, and assumed profound disdain. His\r\nsilence was judicious, but it was not from disdain.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt this day it is easy to see that Pearson as against Jenner\r\nplayed his part badly, failing to recognise his proper advantage.\r\nJenner’s prescription in the _Inquiry_ of 1798 was not Cowpox. It\r\nwas Horsegrease Cowpox. It was a disease of the horse inoculated on\r\nthe cow. Cowpox _per se_ he expressly rejected as useless, having\r\nno specific effect on the human constitution. Pearson and Woodville\r\nentertained Jenner’s prescription in good faith. They tried to\r\ngenerate pox on the cow with grease from the horse, but did not\r\nsucceed. Reluctantly they abandoned Jenner’s prescription, and\r\nresorted to Cowpox.\r\n\r\nWhilst Pearson and Woodville were without prejudice against\r\nHorsegrease Cowpox, it was otherwise with the public. The origin of\r\nCowpox in Horsegrease was voted detestable, and had the origin been\r\nmaintained, it is not improbable that the New Inoculation would\r\nhave proved abortive.\r\n\r\nThis difficulty Pearson and Woodville, the chief promoters of\r\nthe New Inoculation, cleared away. They had tried Horsegrease;\r\nthey considered they had disproved Jenner’s assertion concerning\r\nit; and they were able to assure the public that they inoculated\r\nwith Cowpox, and nothing but Cowpox, and had no connection with\r\nHorsegrease whatever. The public were satisfied; and Inoculation\r\nwith Cowpox became the rage, fashionable and philanthropic.\r\n\r\nWhat did Jenner do? Did he vindicate his prescription, the fruit of\r\nthirty years of incessant thought, observation and experiment? He\r\ndid not. On the contrary he dropped it. He said not another word\r\nabout it; and proceeded to claim Cowpox as employed by Pearson and\r\nWoodville as his discovery. In his petition to Parliament there was\r\nno mention of Horsegrease Cowpox; but Cowpox, with “its beneficial\r\neffect of rendering the persons inoculated therewith perfectly\r\nsecure through life from the infection of Smallpox,” was set forth\r\nas the result of his most attentive and laborious investigation at\r\nthe sacrifice of time, money, and professional advancement. We have\r\nto recollect that Jenner was inspired with what he called “the fond\r\nhope of enjoying independence,” and he was not slow to recognise,\r\nthat if he stood by Horsegrease Cowpox his “fond hope” would be\r\nwrecked. The statement may seem incredible, but the fact of the\r\ntransformation is manifest at large to any one who will take the\r\ntrouble to compare Jenner’s _Inquiry_ of 1798 with his Petition to\r\nthe House of Commons in 1802.\r\n\r\nPearson failed to arrest the imposture. He might have said to\r\nJenner, “Your discovery was not Cowpox: that was well known\r\nto every dairymaid in your neighbourhood. Your prescription\r\nwas Horsegrease Cowpox. You condemned Cowpox, which Cowpox has\r\nnevertheless been brought into use by Woodville and me. Keep to\r\nyour Horsegrease Cowpox; make what you can of it; and leave us\r\nalone.”\r\n\r\nHad Pearson taken this course, he would have fixed Jenner to his\r\ndiscovery, such as it was, and have clearly defined and established\r\nhis own and Woodville’s service in rendering the New Inoculation\r\npracticable and popular. But he failed to draw a firm line between\r\nWoodville and himself and Jenner, and to insist that they were\r\noperating, not only with a different pox, but with a form of pox by\r\nhim rejected as useless. Through this default, he enabled Jenner\r\nto intrude into a province that was not his own, and to reap where\r\nhe had not sown, and gather where he had not strawed. It is to be\r\nadmitted that the facts as stated were all involved in Pearson’s\r\n_Examination_, but they were _involved_, and required picking out\r\nand sharper definition to give them effect. Truth is truth, but\r\ntruth to have its rightful influence has to be made plain. It is of\r\nlittle avail to have a good cause at law if the means are wanting\r\nto place its goodness manifest and paramount over contention to the\r\ncontrary.\r\n\r\nThis, too, may be observed: Pearson was not in condition to offer\r\nthe manner of resistance specified. To have turned Jenner’s flank,\r\nit would have been necessary to discredit Cowpox; and Pearson was\r\ncommitted to Cowpox. Jenner had been familiar from youth with the\r\ndairymaids’ faith in Cowpox. Why then did he not advertise its\r\nvirtue? Because it had been proved to him that the dairymaids’\r\nconfidence was illusory. His recommendation of Horsegrease Cowpox\r\nattested his distrust in Cowpox. If Pearson had asked himself,\r\nWhat induced Jenner to set aside Cowpox for Horsegrease Cowpox?\r\nthe answer would have revealed to him a whole series of facts\r\nto the discredit of that prophylaxy of which he and Woodville\r\nhad constituted themselves advocates. Thus, fettered by his own\r\nprepossession, Pearson was unable to deal effectually with Jenner\r\nwithout incurring a disenchantment fatal to his own enterprise.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen we recognise that Jenner’s prescription was a disease of\r\nthe horse communicated to the cow, which Pearson and Woodville\r\nset aside for Cowpox, the controversy as to the originator of\r\nthe use of Cowpox for inoculation loses significance. We have to\r\nassert peremptorily that Jenner had no claim to the use of Cowpox\r\nwhatever. It is true that he advanced the claim in his _Origin of\r\nthe Vaccine Inoculation_ in 1801, and in his Petition to Parliament\r\nin 1802; but those who refer to his _Inquiry_ of 1798 will require\r\nno further proof of his mendacity. That his claim to the use of\r\nCowpox was entertained can only be ascribed to that indolence,\r\nineptitude and ignorance on the part of the world whereon quacks\r\npresume and prosper.\r\n\r\nIt was Pearson and Woodville, I once more repeat, who diffused\r\nand popularised Cowpox; and Pearson’s inquiries left no doubt\r\nthat the faith in Cowpox as a preventive of Smallpox was widely\r\nentertained; and that the substitution of Cowpox for Smallpox in\r\ninoculation was a mere question of time and accident. Mr. Downe\r\nof Bridport informed Pearson that a surgeon in his neighbourhood\r\nsuffered discredit in practice because it was reported that he\r\ninoculated with Cowpox instead of Smallpox; and the papers of\r\nMr. Nash, surgeon, of Shaftesbury proved that in 1781 he had the\r\nproject of Cowpox Inoculation distinctly before him. The evidence\r\nof Benjamin Jesty, farmer of Downshay in the Isle of Purbeck, has\r\nusually been taken as most conclusive in relation to the immanence\r\nof the New Inoculation in the common mind. Jesty was invited to\r\nLondon by the conductors of the Original Vaccine Pock Institution,\r\n44 Broad Street, Golden Square; and in August, 1805, they had him\r\nwith his wife and two sons under examination. In their report[130]\r\nit is said--\r\n\r\n  We think it a matter of justice to Mr. Jesty, and beneficial to\r\n  the public, to attest, that among other facts he has afforded\r\n  decisive evidence of his having vaccinated his wife and two sons,\r\n  Robert and Benjamin, in the year 1774; who were thereby rendered\r\n  insusceptible of the Smallpox, as appears from the frequent\r\n  exposure of all three to that disorder during the course of 31\r\n  years, and from the inoculation of the two sons for the Smallpox\r\n  15 years ago.\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed that insusceptibility to Smallpox was by\r\nno means infrequent apart from Cowpox; and as fear of Smallpox\r\npredisposes to attack, so, on the other hand, confidence in\r\nsecurity, whether by Cowpox or other charm, would tend to exemption.\r\n\r\nJesty’s reasons for his experiment were thus specified--\r\n\r\n  He was led to undertake the novel practice in 1774 to counteract\r\n  the Smallpox, at that time prevalent at Yetminster, from\r\n  knowing the common opinion of the country ever since he was a\r\n  boy (now 60 years ago) that persons who had gone through the\r\n  Cowpock naturally, that is to say by taking it from cows, were\r\n  insusceptible of the Smallpox.\r\n\r\n  By himself being incapable of taking the Smallpox, having gone\r\n  through the Cowpock many years before.\r\n\r\n  From knowing many individuals who after the Cowpock could not\r\n  have the Smallpox excited.\r\n\r\n  From believing that the Cowpock was an affection free from\r\n  danger; and from his opinion that by the Cowpock Inoculation\r\n  he should avoid engrafting various diseases of the human\r\n  constitution, such as “the Evil, madness, lues, and many bad\r\n  humours,” as he called them.\r\n\r\nIn these reasons we have the Cowpox doctrine as prevalent in\r\nDorsetshire, which Jesty developed in family practice. The report\r\nproceeds--\r\n\r\n  The remarkably vigorous health of Mr. Jesty, his wife, and two\r\n  sons, now 31 years subsequent to the Cowpock, and his own healthy\r\n  appearance, at this time 70 years of age, afford a singularly\r\n  strong proof of the harmlessness of that affection; but the\r\n  public must, with particular interest, hear that during the late\r\n  visit to town, Mr. Robert Jesty submitted publicly to inoculation\r\n  for the Smallpox in the most rigorous manner; and that Mr. Jesty\r\n  also was subjected to the trial of inoculation for the Cowpock\r\n  after the most efficacious mode, without either of them being\r\n  infected.\r\n\r\nIt is curious how evidence conforms to prepossession. Dr. Pearson\r\nand his associates were persuaded that as no one could have\r\nSmallpox twice, neither could any one have Cowpox twice. Jesty\r\nhad Cowpox when young, and when at three score they found him\r\ninsusceptible, they took it for granted that re-vaccination was\r\nimpossible. Robert Jesty, who had Cowpox thirty-one years before\r\nwas at the same time inoculated with Smallpox, and as that likewise\r\nfailed to take, the experiment enforced the desired conclusion.\r\n\r\nHaving turned out so well, praise and portraiture were bestowed on\r\nJesty--\r\n\r\n  The circumstances in which Mr. Jesty purposely instituted the\r\n  Vaccine Pock Inoculation in his own family, namely, without\r\n  any precedent, but merely from reasoning upon the nature of\r\n  the affection among cows, and from knowing its effects in the\r\n  casual way among men, his exemption from the prevailing popular\r\n  prejudices, and his disregard of the clamorous reproaches of his\r\n  neighbours, will entitle him, in our opinion, to the respect\r\n  of the public for his superior strength of mind. Further, his\r\n  conduct in again furnishing such decisive proofs of the permanent\r\n  anti-variolous efficacy of the Cowpock, in the present [1805]\r\n  discontented state of mind in many families, by submitting to\r\n  Inoculation, justly claims at least the gratitude of the country.\r\n\r\n  As a testimony of our personal regard, and to commemorate so\r\n  extraordinary a fact as that of preventing the Smallpox by\r\n  inoculating for the Cowpock 31 years ago, at our request, a\r\n  three-quarter length picture of Mr. Jesty is painted by that\r\n  excellent artist, Mr. Sharp, to be preserved at the Original\r\n  Vaccine Pock Institution.\r\n\r\n    GEO.

Jesty inoculated\r\nwith Cowpox, sharing the dairymaids’ faith that it prevented\r\nSmallpox. Jenner knew that the dairymaids were wrong, and that\r\nCowpox did not avert Smallpox. What he recommended was Cowpox\r\nproduced by Horsegrease. Pearson and Woodville disregarded\r\nJenner’s recommendation and made use of Cowpox like Jesty, which\r\nsubstitution Jenner did not resist; and not only did not resist,\r\nbut claimed as the fulfilment of his programme! Jenner should never\r\nbe suffered to get mixed up with Jesty, and the course of his\r\nprocedure be thereby obscured.\r\n\r\nI am explicit to iteration because the truth is not recognised\r\nand may be accounted incredible. In another way the facts may be\r\nthrown into relief if we inquire, How would Jenner have fared\r\nhad he applied for a patent? Suppose his several publications\r\nwere submitted to a patent-agent, In what manner could a tenable\r\nspecification be evolved from these materials?\r\n\r\n    1798.--_The Inquiry._                    { Prescribes Horsegrease\r\n                                             { Cowpox.\r\n\r\n                                             { Slackens off from\r\n                                             { Horsegrease Cowpox;\r\n                                             { ascribes its\r\n    1799.--_Further Observations._           { efficacy to common\r\n    1800.--_Continuation of Observations._   { repute; and recommends\r\n                                             { escharotics to arrest\r\n                                             { its virulence.\r\n\r\n                                             { Claim of discovery and\r\n    1801.--_Origin of Vaccine Inoculation._  { use of Cowpox, previously\r\n    1802.--Petition to Parliament.           { condemned as spurious,\r\n                                             { and Horsegrease Cowpox\r\n                                             { dropped.\r\n\r\nBy no ingenuity could a valid patent be got out of these documents.\r\nIf Horsegrease Cowpox were selected as the basis of claim, what\r\nof the repudiation of Cowpox? and if Cowpox, what of Horsegrease\r\nCowpox? And if Horsegrease Cowpox, what of the ascription of its\r\nvirtue to common repute? And if Cowpox, was not the committee\r\nof the House of Commons in 1802 compelled to disallow Jenner’s\r\nclaim to the discovery, and to define and limit his merit to the\r\npropagation of its virus from arm to arm? It was, however, Pearson\r\nand Woodville who first propagated Cowpox from arm to arm: Jenner’s\r\nstart being made with Horsegrease Cowpox. But allowing him so much\r\ncredit, it is nevertheless to be remembered that it was at that\r\ntime a frequent practice to inoculate with Smallpox from arm to\r\narm; and the substitution of Cowpox for Smallpox was a trifle for\r\nwhich to pay £10,000 and dissolve in ecstasies of admiration.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[128] _An Examination of the Report of the Committee of the House\r\nof Commons on the Claims of Remuneration for the Vaccine Pock\r\nInoculation: containing a Statement of the Principal Historical\r\nFacts of the Vaccinia._ By George Pearson, M.D., F.R.S.

If no one\r\ncould have Smallpox twice, and if inoculated Cowpox was equivalent\r\nto Smallpox, no one could have Cowpox twice. Such was the argument.\r\nPearson did not foresee its systematic refutation exemplified in\r\nRe-Vaccination, septennial, triennial, annual.\r\n\r\n[130] _Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal_, October, 1805. P.\r\n513.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nOBSERVATIONS ON THE POSITION IN 1802.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of my medical readers observes--\r\n\r\n  The House of Commons in 1802 was committed to a variety of\r\n  extravagances, but, allowing for these, you have to account for\r\n  certain evidence that Cowpox had _some_ influence over Smallpox;\r\n  for you surely do not mean to contend that it had _no_ influence\r\n  over that disease, and that the evidence before the Committee was\r\n  a uniform tissue of illusion and delusion.\r\n\r\nPut thus, it is as difficult to deal with the objection as it is\r\nto prove a negative. It is not for me to define the influence of\r\ncowpox over smallpox, but for those who believe in its prophylaxy.\r\nI should argue that as ill-health leads to ill-health, and as\r\ncorruption breeds corruption, that inoculated cowpox would generate\r\na habit of body favourable to smallpox, and at the same time tend\r\nto excite and intensify other forms of disease. I would also ask,\r\nWhat are the extravagances to be allowed for? When these are\r\ndetermined we may then proceed to discuss what are not extravagant.\r\nIt is a common form of evasion to make a general confession\r\nof guilt in order to avoid the pain of specific and explicit\r\ncondemnation. It is conceded that the House of Commons in 1802\r\n“committed a variety of extravagances,” and under this appearance\r\nof candour the chief extravagance is implicitly re-asserted and\r\ncarried forward, namely, that inoculated cowpox had an influence\r\nadverse to smallpox.\r\n\r\nIn the “variety of extravagances,” few, I suppose, would hesitate\r\nto include the asserted annual smallpox mortality of the United\r\nKingdom. Sir Gilbert Blane pronounced it 45,000, while Dr. Lettsom\r\ngave it as 36,000--a wide difference in the play of fancy! Dr.\r\nLettsom, who claimed to have paid much attention to figures\r\nconnected with smallpox, was pleased to convert an extreme London\r\nmortality, namely, 3000, into the ordinary mortality, although in\r\nsome years it fell under 1000. Then estimating the population of\r\nLondon at one million, and the population of the United Kingdom\r\nas twelve millions, he multiplied 3000 by 12, and evoked the\r\nastounding national death-rate of 36,000 annually from smallpox,\r\nall of whom were to be saved by Jenner’s prescription! But whether\r\nhe had taken the average or even the lowest metropolitan mortality,\r\nthe computation would have remained grossly fallacious. London\r\novercrowded and pestiferous, was no standard for the general\r\npopulation, urban or rural; and the assumption was monstrous\r\nthat smallpox, a notoriously sporadic disease, was constant and\r\nequally diffused over the land. We are without comprehensive vital\r\nstatistics for the time in question, but arguing from the London of\r\nto-day in continual connection with the provinces, to the London\r\nof 1802 in comparative isolation, what do we find? Why, smallpox\r\nprevalent in London with little or no smallpox in the country! In\r\nthe _Pall Mall Gazette_ of 31st May, 1878, we read--\r\n\r\n  The degree in which the Smallpox epidemic of the last seven years\r\n  has been localised in London is very remarkable. The _Lancet_\r\n  points out that during the week ending 25th May, 51 fatal cases\r\n  were registered in London and its suburban districts, whereas not\r\n  one was recorded in any of the nineteen large provincial towns\r\n  having an aggregate population about equal to that of London.\r\n  Since the beginning of the year the fatal cases of Smallpox\r\n  within fifteen miles of Charing Cross have been 1,134, while but\r\n  8 have occurred in the nineteen other large towns.\r\n\r\nWe find similar illustrations of the sporadic character of smallpox\r\nwherever we can get at the facts. In 1874 there died in London 735\r\nof smallpox, but not one in Birmingham; 386 in Liverpool, but not\r\none in Plymouth; 347 in Salford, but not one in Nottingham; 190 in\r\nManchester, and but 1 in Sheffield; 24 in Bristol and 4 in Leeds;\r\nand so on. What reason is there to believe that what is true of\r\nsmallpox within our own experience was otherwise in the experience\r\nof our forefathers?\r\n\r\nI said that few would hesitate to include Dr. Lettsom’s 36,000\r\nand Sir Gilbert Blane’s 45,000 among the extravagances of 1802,\r\nbut I forgot myself. We have a National Health Society with the\r\nDuke of Westminster for President and all manner of notables,\r\naristocratic, philanthropic, scientific, and literary, among\r\nits committee and members. Now this Society issues a hand-bill\r\nof advices and warnings relating to smallpox, approved too by\r\nthe Local Government Board, and there we find set forth as\r\nunquestionable matter of fact--\r\n\r\n  “_Before the introduction of Vaccination Smallpox killed 40,000\r\n  persons yearly in this country._”\r\n\r\nWe thus see how hard it is for a convenient fable to die, even when\r\nknown to be false, and how respectable people will keep repeating\r\nit as long as they fancy it is for good.\r\n\r\nAbsurd as was the extension of the ratio of London smallpox to the\r\npopulations of the United Kingdom, of Europe, and of the world,\r\nthe London disease itself afforded little warrant for the extreme\r\nterms of horror and dismay with which it was described. Smallpox\r\ndid not increase the death-rate of London: when smallpox was\r\nmost prevalent and least prevalent, the total mortality was but\r\nslightly affected. As long as the sanitary conditions of the great\r\ncity remained unchanged, fevers replaced smallpox and smallpox\r\nreplaced fevers, and whether deaths were from one form of disease\r\nor another, so that the people died the same, what did it matter?\r\nSmallpox when most prevalent was never accountable for much more\r\nthan 10 per cent. of the total London mortality, and in some years\r\nfor less than 3 per cent.; and it is to be remembered that the\r\nlarger portion of that mortality was infantile mortality--smallpox\r\nbeing in the great majority of cases a disease of the young; none\r\nthe less objectionable on that account, but less chargeable than\r\nsome other forms of zymotic disease with striking down the adult\r\nbread-winner and enlarging misery and pauperism.\r\n\r\nAgain, in much of the talk about smallpox, it was assumed that the\r\ndisease had no limits--that it was something like fire, and might\r\nspread to any extent if unchecked. But what was there to justify\r\nsuch an assumption? Assuredly nothing in London experience.\r\nSmallpox was always present in London, waxing and waning under\r\nsome unknown law; the deaths rising as high as 3992 in 1772 and\r\nfalling as low as 522 in 1797--the extremes of the century. Why\r\ndid 4000 never die in any year, or 7000, or 10,000? When a fire\r\nis extinguished, we know it has met with a check; and if smallpox\r\ncaused 3992 deaths in 1772 and 522 in 1797, and smallpox be like\r\nfire, there was, we see, a check; and I ask, What was that check?\r\nThere may be answers, but none for unreserved acceptance. What\r\nis certain is, that in London smallpox was never an illimitable\r\naffliction. It had limits, and it was only in the rhetoric of\r\nalarmists that it had none.\r\n\r\nAnd the check to the disease (whatever it was) lay in the bodies of\r\nthe citizens, and not in their therapeutics. Isolation was rarely\r\nattempted, and in their crowded habitations was impracticable.\r\nMoreover they had not only the smallpox appropriate to their\r\nevil conditions to contend with, but the disease as propagated\r\nand diffused by the inoculators. What we have to say is, that\r\nwhilst in the London of last century we behold smallpox endemic\r\nand cultivated, yet in no year did the mortality therefrom exceed\r\n4,000; and further, that with so much to favour and stimulate the\r\ndisease it was a diminishing quantity. In the words of Dr. Farr--\r\n\r\n  London Smallpox attained its maximum mortality after inoculation\r\n  was introduced, and the disease began to grow less fatal before\r\n  vaccination was discovered.\r\n\r\nWe shall see as we proceed how the natural check to smallpox\r\n(whatever it was), the immunity of the majority from infection,\r\nand the decline of the disease were all claimed as the blessed\r\nresults of Jenner’s prescription; and now-a-days it has passed\r\ninto common-place, for which evidence is thought superfluous,\r\nthat without that prescription smallpox might have illimitable\r\nextension. If anywhere a variolous epidemic is slight, it is said\r\nthat but for vaccination it would have been severe; and if severe,\r\nthat its intensity would have been doubled or trebled save for the\r\naction of the same prophylactic. We have a remarkable illustration\r\nof this style of prophecy in the Report of the Select Committee of\r\nthe House of Commons upon the Vaccination Act of 1867, dated 23rd\r\nMay, 1871, where we read--\r\n\r\n  Smallpox unchecked by Vaccination, is one of the most terrible\r\n  and destructive of all diseases as regards the danger of\r\n  infection, the proportion of deaths among those attacked, and the\r\n  permanent injury to the survivors.\r\n\r\n  Your Committee believe that if Vaccination had not been general,\r\n  _the epidemic_ [then prevalent] _would have become a pestilence,\r\n  raging with the destructive force of the Plague of the middle\r\n  ages_.\r\n\r\nWhat is beyond evidence is beyond refutation; and the imaginations\r\nof M.P.’s, dull though they be, not unfrequently prevail over their\r\nintelligence.\r\n\r\nTo set aside the mass of testimony adduced by Jenner’s friends\r\nbefore the Commons’ Committee in 1802 is sometimes described as\r\na hopeless undertaking; but the answer to such a boast is, that\r\nexperience has nullified the essential part of that testimony, and\r\nthat there is little left to account for. No well-informed medical\r\npractitioner now believes what the Committee was led to believe,\r\nthat to be inoculated with cowpox was to be secure from smallpox\r\nfor life. The security, where still credited, is subject to so many\r\nqualifications that the primitive inoculators with cowpox would\r\nhave thought such protection not worth paying for, still less of\r\nexulting over as the greatest discovery ever made in medicine.\r\nNor would many now admit the validity of the Variolous Test which\r\nthen carried conviction with irresistible force. Inoculation with\r\nsmallpox was in itself an uncertain operation, and that it should\r\nfail after inoculation with cowpox, ere the poisoning of the\r\nblood had been worked off, was in nowise surprising. The exposure\r\nof vaccinated subjects to smallpox infection was in like manner\r\ndeceptive; and it was conveniently forgotten that all manner\r\nof people were exposed to contagion with impunity in the usual\r\ncircumstances of life. Taking a year of exceptional smallpox in\r\nLondon, such as Dr. Lettsom set forth as ordinary, when 18,000 were\r\naffected and 3000 died (that is one in six), there were in the\r\nmillion of inhabitants 982,000 who escaped. How did they escape?\r\nA multitude must have come into immediate contact with the sick:\r\nHow did they remain unscathed? The question is simple, but it is\r\ncrucial. If smallpox were like fire, and men, women, and children\r\nlike fuel, why did not all burn? Under what prophylaxy did they\r\nabide secure? Again in this connection, we must not lose sight\r\nof the magic of faith. Things being equal, two persons exposed\r\nto smallpox, one confident that he was invulnerable through\r\nvaccination, and the other apprehensive of danger, the chances are,\r\nthat the fearful would be attacked whilst the fearless would have\r\nhis faith justified in immunity.\r\n\r\nIn considerations thus obvious it is not difficult to understand\r\nhow the testimony delivered to the Committee had a semblance as of\r\nveracious Nature. Any one who has studied the history of remedies,\r\nor the various quackeries within his own observation, will know\r\nhow easy it is to conjure up testimony, with asseverations\r\npresumptuous to question, which by-and-by are gradually discredited\r\nand ultimately disappear in forgetfulness. I have, therefore,\r\nno disposition to be hard on the men of 1802. From our vantage\r\nof experience we see how they were led astray, and recognise\r\nthe pressure of the influences under which they acted. Moreover\r\na remedy that bore the promise of relief from the pest of\r\nsmallpox inoculation came with strong seduction. What a pest that\r\ninoculation was, how it was loathed, and how it was submitted to\r\nunder the persuasion of duty are written at large in the domestic\r\nmemoirs of last century. Every mother among the upper and middle\r\nclasses was persuaded that it was necessary for her children\r\nto undergo the variolous ordeal--an ordeal that involved the\r\ndeliberate introduction of smallpox into her household. It was\r\nhateful, it was intolerable, and yet it had to be endured! The\r\ndoctors minimised the risks to the uttermost, but what they really\r\nbelieved plainly appeared when vaccination presented itself as an\r\nalternative. Then smallpox inoculation was denounced by its former\r\npractitioners with a fervour that contrasted painfully with their\r\nantecedent professions; whilst parents heard with indescribable\r\nsatisfaction that absolute life-long security from smallpox was\r\nhenceforward insured at the price of a trifling operation attended\r\nby no peril whatever, and with distinct benefit to health. To make\r\nthe contrast clear I subjoin copy of a hand-bill that was posted on\r\nwalls and circulated by thousands in London and the country at the\r\ntime of which I write, 1801-2.\r\n\r\n\r\n  A TABLE SHEWING THE ADVANTAGES OF VACCINE INOCULATION.\r\n\r\n       _The Natural            _The Inoculated           _The Inoculated\r\n         Smallpox._               Smallpox._                Cowpock._\r\n\r\n  I.

Smallpox_.\r\n\r\n  From this faithful statement of the advantages attending VACCINE\r\n  INOCULATION, it must appear evident to every unprejudiced person,\r\n  that it is the duty as well as the interest of every parent, of\r\n  every individual, and of every nation, to adopt the practice, and\r\n  to hasten\r\n\r\n    THE EXTERMINATION OF THE SMALLPOX.\r\n\r\nIt was thus that Vaccination was introduced to the English people,\r\nnot by men accounted quacks, but by leaders of the medical\r\nprofession; and whatever the illusions and mischiefs of the\r\nnew practice, we must allow it the credit of discouraging and\r\nultimately superseding the grosser practice of inoculation with\r\nsmallpox. As for the various items in the bill, we have had, and\r\nshall have them before us, and I would only now recall attention\r\nto the initial statement that “Smallpox destroys a tenth part\r\nof mankind.” The summary answer to the statement is that the\r\nnumber of mankind was unknown, likewise their diseases, and the\r\nproportion in which they were fatal. It was a repetition of Dr.\r\nLettsom’s unwarrantable extension of a bad year of London smallpox\r\nto the whole earth. Even in an occasional year when upwards of\r\n3000 died in London of smallpox, the total average mortality was\r\nnot seriously affected thereby. The deaths, as we have observed,\r\nwere merely taken out in smallpox instead of in some other form of\r\nfever. That nothing can permanently reduce the death-rate of any\r\ncommunity save improved sanitary conditions and personal habits was\r\nunrevealed in 1802.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the exultation over Jenner, “the saviour of the\r\nworld from smallpox,” and over “the greatest discovery since the\r\ncreation of man,” the suspicion is unavoidable that it was largely\r\nfactitious--“from the teeth outwards,” as Carlyle would have said.\r\nThe vote of £10,000 to the miraculous benefactor of the human race\r\nwas carried by a majority of three in a Parliament to which no\r\nmore than 115 members could be whipped up, and neither Pitt or Fox\r\nthought it worth while to be present. Nor was Jenner treated as if\r\nhis asserted services to mankind were soberly credited. “Yes,” it\r\nmay be said, “the world never recognises its true benefactors;”\r\nbut the observation does not apply, for Jenner was profusely\r\nrecognised, and received praise from his contemporaries which\r\nposterity hesitates to repeat. Nevertheless the praise, though\r\nprofuse, was little more than verbal. Some expressed indignation\r\nat the paltry award of £10,000, and proposed to start a national\r\nsubscription, but no one took the initiative, and the national\r\ngratitude was not put to the test. Even the £10,000 was paid\r\ntardily. Writing to a friend on 3rd June, 1804, Jenner had to\r\nrelate that--\r\n\r\n  The Treasury still withholds the payment of what was voted to me\r\n  two years ago; and now there are new officers, and it may yet be\r\n  very long before a guinea reaches me from that quarter.\r\n\r\nWhen at last the money was paid, nearly £1000 was deducted for\r\nfees, etc.; and, having the repute of the money, he was considered\r\npublic property. As Dr. Baron records--\r\n\r\n  The people of England seemed to think that the fee-simple of his\r\n  body and mind had been purchased by the TEN THOUSAND POUNDS; and\r\n  many an unjust and ungenerous intimation of this feeling was\r\n  conveyed to him. To a mind like his, this was no small annoyance.\r\n  He was called upon for explanations and opinions by every person\r\n  who thought a direct communication with the Author of Vaccination\r\n  an honour worth seeking, while they might have obtained all the\r\n  information they wanted in his published writings.\r\n\r\nSo much was matter of course, but Jenner had worse to encounter.\r\nHe took the fine talk of his medical and political friends _au\r\nsérieux_, bade farewell to Berkeley, and set up as London physician\r\nin Hertford Street, May Fair. The result we have in his own words--\r\n\r\n  Elated and allured by the speech of the Chancellor of the\r\n  Exchequer, I took a house in London for ten years, at a high\r\n  rent, and furnished it; but my first year’s practice convinced\r\n  me of my own temerity and imprudence, and the falsity of the\r\n  Minister’s prediction. My fees fell off both in number and value;\r\n  for, extraordinary to tell, some of those families in which I had\r\n  been before employed, now sent to their own domestic surgeons\r\n  or apothecaries to inoculate their children, alleging that they\r\n  could not think of troubling Dr. Jenner about a thing executed so\r\n  easily as vaccine inoculation. Others, who gave me such fees as I\r\n  thought myself entitled to at the first inoculation, reduced them\r\n  at the second, and sank them still lower at the third.\r\n\r\nHis fees did not amount to £350 a year, and he presently found\r\nhimself nothing the better for the parliamentary grant, and\r\ninvolved in grave financial difficulties. He wrote to a friend, 2nd\r\nNovember, 1804--\r\n\r\n  The London smoke is apt to cloud our best faculties. I do\r\n  not intend to risk the injury of mine in this way, unless\r\n  occasionally for the transaction of business. The public has not\r\n  the smallest right to require such a sacrifice of me. I have\r\n  received no reward for showing them how to remove one of the\r\n  greatest obstacles to human happiness; but, on the contrary, am\r\n  loaded with a tax of more than £400 a year!\r\n\r\nAnd to another correspondent--\r\n\r\n  I have now completely made up my mind respecting London. I have\r\n  done with it, and have again commenced as village doctor. I found\r\n  my purse not equal to the sinking of a £1000 annually (which has\r\n  actually been the case for several successive years) nor the\r\n  gratitude of the public deserving such a sacrifice. How hard\r\n  after what I have done, the toils I have gone through, and the\r\n  anxieties I have endured _in obtaining for the world a greater\r\n  gift than man ever bestowed on the world before_ (excuse this\r\n  burst of egotism), to be thrown by with a bare remuneration of my\r\n  expenses.\r\n\r\nIt was hard! People who attributed to Jenner the greatest discovery\r\never made, the preservation of from 36,000 to 45,000 lives\r\nannually in the United Kingdom, and the salvation of the human\r\nrace from smallpox, were indeed entitled to have dealt with him\r\nmore handsomely. He had sympathisers and candid friends. “Your\r\nliberality and disinterestedness every one must admire,” wrote Mr.\r\nBenjamin Travers, “but you are sadly deficient in worldly wisdom.\r\nIf you had undertaken the extinction of the smallpox yourself, with\r\ncoadjutors of your own appointment, I am confident, you might have\r\nput £100,000 in your pocket; and the glory would have been as great\r\nand the benefit to the community the same.” How that £100,000 was\r\nused to tantalise him! and yet, as Dr. Pearson pointed out, never\r\nany one showed on what practicable terms the immense sum could have\r\nbeen earned by means of cowpox.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTHE ROYAL JENNERIAN SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n\r\nJenner, jealous of Pearson, was anxious to supersede the\r\nInstitution for the Inoculation of the Vaccine Pock established\r\nby him in 1799; but Jenner was what Scots call “a feckless\r\ncreature,” whose wishes rarely issue in fruit. After his success\r\nin Parliament, he did not remain in London to improve his\r\nopportunities, but retreated to domestic quiet at Berkeley and\r\nCheltenham. His friends, however, were mindful of him, and Dr.\r\nHawes, Mr. Addington, surgeon, Benjamin Travers, and Joseph Leaper\r\nmet in Queen Street, City, 3rd December, 1802, and resolved\r\nto establish a “JENNERIAN SOCIETY for the Extinction of the\r\nSmall-Pox.” Mr. Addington transmitted the resolution of the meeting\r\nto Jenner, saying--\r\n\r\n  We look to your direction and assistance, and feel very desirous\r\n  of knowing when it is probable we may have the pleasure of seeing\r\n  you in town.\r\n\r\nJoseph Fox of Lombard Street, dentist and enthusiastic promoter of\r\nthe new inoculation, also wrote to him, 4th December, soliciting\r\nhis co-operation--\r\n\r\n  The plan which is in agitation is of the most extensive and\r\n  liberal kind. It is even expected that the Royal countenance\r\n  will be gained; but much depends upon thee. All are looking\r\n  toward thee as the proper person to lay the foundation-stone. It\r\n  would be well if this could be done in the course of the present\r\n  year, particularly as it is the memorable time when the practice\r\n  received parliamentary sanction.\r\n\r\nBut the ease-loving Jenner was not to be drawn. He wrote to Mr.\r\nAddington from Berkeley, 10th December, 1802--\r\n\r\n  Your very obliging letter found me just returned with my wife\r\n  and children to our pleasant home, where I promised myself a few\r\n  weeks of domestic comfort after some years spent in constant\r\n  anxieties.\r\n\r\n  This is the pull on one side. On the other is the delightful\r\n  prospect held up to my view of an Establishment for the promotion\r\n  of Universal Vaccine Inoculation--an establishment to which I\r\n  have for years been looking forward with a longing eye.\r\n\r\n  I need not go farther into explanation, and shall only say, that\r\n  if it be incompatible with the generous design to suffer me to\r\n  remain here for the time I had allowed myself, I will certainly\r\n  comply with the wishes of my friends and go to town. Yet it must\r\n  be observed that I humbly conceive and ardently hope that my\r\n  presence will not be absolutely necessary. I have written to my\r\n  friend Dr. Lettsom and requested him to have the kindness to be\r\n  (as far as such a thing is admissible) my representative. In his\r\n  judgment on the present occasion I can place every confidence.\r\n\r\nThe letter describes the man. He did not like to be troubled--not\r\neven when action stood for the advancement of his own glory. As\r\nPearson observed, “If Vaccination had been left to Jenner, it would\r\nnever have come to anything.” Benjamin Travers also wrote to him\r\nat the same time urging the necessity of his presence in London,\r\nbut he was put off with similar excuses and with expectations of\r\nassistance from the public purse--\r\n\r\n  Government, I have no doubt, will give due support to so just\r\n  and laudable an undertaking. I am warranted in this suggestion\r\n  by a long conversation I had with Mr. Abbott, Speaker of the\r\n  House of Commons, who said that after the investigation of the\r\n  Parliamentary Committee he thought it became a public duty to\r\n  form Institutions for Gratuitous Inoculation.\r\n\r\nAs Jenner was not to be had, the promoters set to work without him,\r\nand their triumph was complete when at a meeting in the London\r\nTavern on 17th February, 1803, it was announced that his Majesty\r\nhad graciously condescended to become the patron of “THE ROYAL\r\nJENNERIAN SOCIETY for the Extermination of the Smallpox:” that\r\nher Majesty had with great benignity acquiesced in the request to\r\nbecome patroness: that his Royal Highness the Prince of Wales and\r\ntheir Royal Highnesses the Duke of York, the Duke of Clarence, and\r\nthe Duke of Cumberland, had evinced, in a most flattering manner,\r\ntheir willingness to accept the office of vice-patrons: that his\r\nGrace the Duke of Bedford had consented to fill the office of\r\npresident; and that many prelates, noblemen, and gentlemen of the\r\nhighest rank and respectability had agreed to be vice-presidents of\r\nthe Society.\r\n\r\nThe approval of the Prince of Wales was conveyed in a letter\r\nof the Earl of Egremont, over which Baron, Jenner’s biographer\r\n(writing when the Prince had blossomed into George IV.), bursts\r\ninto worship in capitals, as follows--\r\n\r\n  The gracious and beneficent mind of the Illustrious writer is\r\n  displayed in every line; and the whole is truly characteristic of\r\n  those great qualities which continue to add lustre to his still\r\n  more EXALTED STATION and shed so much of real glory on his REIGN.\r\n\r\nSubscriptions flowed in freely. The Corporation of London gave\r\n£500, the East India Company £100, the Duke of Bedford £50, and\r\nguineas ten, five, two and one were contributed with a liberality\r\nthat attested the fervour of the common credulity. But it was much\r\neasier to get money than to administer it with a nice adjustment of\r\nmeans to ends. The Jennerians, too, were over-organised. There were\r\na Medical Council and a Board of Directors. The Medical Council\r\nconsisted of twenty-five Physicians and twenty-two Surgeons of the\r\nfirst eminence in London, with Jenner for president and Lettsom for\r\nvice-president. Such mechanism could never work, and at the point\r\nwhere real business was to be transacted, an officer was selected\r\nof extraordinary character.\r\n\r\nJohn Walker was born at Cockermouth in 1759, and was a\r\nschool-fellow of Woodville, subsequently physician to the London\r\nSmallpox Hospital. After a rambling career as blacksmith, engraver,\r\nand school-master, he turned his attention to medicine, graduated\r\nat Leyden, associated with French revolutionists in the guise of\r\na member of the Society of Friends; then accompanied Dr. Marshall\r\nin a vaccinating cruise to the Mediterranean, from whence, after\r\na variety of adventures in war and weather, he appeared in London\r\nin 1802, habited as a Quaker with a long beard--an apparition in a\r\nclean shaven community. Joseph Fox, the dentist of Lombard Street,\r\ngave him the use of a part of his house, and there, in his own\r\nwords, “I set up my VACCINIUM for the glorious cause.” As soon as\r\nthe Jennerian Society was initiated, Walker was put forward by\r\nJoseph Fox and other Friends as inoculator-in-chief, and Walker\r\nmade application in the following terms--\r\n\r\n    TO THE JENNERIAN SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n  Friends,--Perhaps there is not any individual who has greater\r\n  reason to be gratified with the interest ye are taking in the\r\n  Vacciole Inoculation than myself.\r\n\r\n  Of late years, the practice of it has been the chief business\r\n  of my life, and I am partly indebted, during some of the last\r\n  months, to the zeal of individual members of your Society for\r\n  being enabled to continue it. They have sent patients to me from\r\n  remote and distant parts of this extensive City, when, for want\r\n  of notoriety, I might otherwise have been unemployed.\r\n\r\n  May I offer to you my services in this way: during the infancy\r\n  of your Institution, you cannot do me a greater pleasure than to\r\n  increase my number of patients; for where I now vacciolate tens,\r\n  I could easily do the same for hundreds.\r\n\r\n  After this declaration, I hope you will consider the present\r\n  address as neither unseasonable nor intrusive, but rather as a\r\n  mark of unwavering zeal in the happy cause in which ye are now\r\n  embarking.\r\n\r\n    Respectfully,\r\n    JOHN WALKER.\r\n\r\n  _54 Lombard Street_, 29. xii., 1802.\r\n\r\nWhen the day of election arrived, four, out of many, were selected\r\nas candidates, one of them being Dr. Domeier, a German, strongly\r\nrecommended by the Queen and Prince of Wales; but the Friends stood\r\nby their man, and Dr. Walker was appointed Resident Inoculator at\r\nthe Central House of the Society in Salisbury Square with a salary\r\nof £200 a year, coal and candles, and liberty to take fees for\r\nprivate “vacciolation.”\r\n\r\nThe promoters of the Society, operating under the prestige of\r\nJenner’s name, resolved to hold their annual festival on his\r\nbirthday, the 17th of May; and at the first dinner in 1803 he was\r\nsubjected to flatteries enough to turn any man’s head who does not\r\nknow the reckless insincerity that prevails on such occasions. It\r\nwas the adulation connected with the formation of this Society that\r\nas much as anything induced Jenner to set up as west-end physician.\r\nThe attempt of the middle-aged country doctor was the occasion\r\nof much grim humour, and his consequent embarrassments were the\r\nconcern of his friends for many a day. Apart from the inherent\r\ndifficulties of the enterprise (social rather than medical) Jenner\r\nwas constitutionally deficient in method and assiduity. Wrapped\r\nup in his wife and family, business was always set aside when\r\nthey claimed his affectionate regard; and to leave London for\r\nGloucestershire for some domestic cause was in his eyes procedure\r\nthat required no defence--all which might be amiable, but it\r\nconstantly annoyed and frustrated his associates; and it is not\r\nthus encumbered that any man can expect to make way in the world.\r\nWhen the anniversary in 1804 came round, Jenner was at Berkeley,\r\nand when pressed to attend he wrote--\r\n\r\n  Though a post-chaise might bring up my body, my mind would be\r\n  left behind. One cause of my absence, among many others, is the\r\n  sad state of Mrs. Jenner’s health. I cannot leave her even for a\r\n  day with any comfort to my feelings. My friends, who honour the\r\n  glorious cause of Vaccination by assembling on the 17th, will,\r\n  I trust, admit my apology. It is my intention to collect a few\r\n  staunch Vaccinists on that day at my cottage. I shall give them\r\n  some roast beef, not forgetting a horn or two of good October. We\r\n  shall close the day with bumpers of milk-punch to the health of\r\n  the Friends of Humanity at the Crown and Anchor; and if it were\r\n  not for the indisposition of my poor wife, we should roar like\r\n  bulls.\r\n\r\nIf Jenner was idle and self-indulgent, Walker was the reverse. He\r\nwas a fine specimen of the GENUS, _Fanatic_. Possessed with a lust\r\nfor what he called Vacciolation, he had a brow of brass, nerves of\r\nsteel, and habits like clockwork. Thirteen stations were opened in\r\nLondon where cowpox was inoculated gratis, and in eighteen months\r\nWalker was able to announce that 12,288 patients had been operated\r\non, and that 19,352 charges of virus had been dispatched to the\r\ncountry and foreign parts; whereon Baron observes--\r\n\r\n  The effect of these exertions was immediately perceived by a\r\n  striking diminution of the number of deaths from smallpox within\r\n  the Bills of Mortality. In 1803 they amounted to 1173; in 1804\r\n  they were only 622. The contrast will appear still greater when\r\n  it is considered that the deaths amounted to 2409 in the year\r\n  1800; and that the annual average of deaths for fifty years\r\n  previously was 2018.[131]\r\n\r\nThe passage is noteworthy as representative of many similar\r\npassages in the literature of Vaccination. It might be described as\r\ndishonest, but the craft is so transparent that the epithet would\r\nbe extravagant. The probable explanation is, that Vaccination had\r\ncome to be regarded as so unquestionably beneficial that _anything_\r\nmight be asserted in its favour, and that _anything_ was true.\r\nElse a child might have asked how 12,000 or 24,000 vaccinations\r\ncould by any possibility affect an immediate diminution in the\r\ndeaths from smallpox in a population of eight or nine hundred\r\nthousand. Baron would also lead his readers to suppose that the\r\nlow mortality of 1804, namely 622, was unexampled, though with the\r\nBills of Mortality before him, he might have seen that the deaths\r\nin 1797 fell to 522; and he knew that the low figure of 1804 was\r\nnot maintained, but rose to 1685 in 1805. But as remarked, _any\r\nstatement_, if only it be favourable to Vaccination, is expected to\r\npass muster as veracious, and the public credulity justifies the\r\nexpectation.\r\n\r\nLet us look at the London Bills for ourselves, taking the last ten\r\nyears of the 18th and the first ten years of the 19th Centuries,\r\nand try to discover what they teach.\r\n\r\n            Burials from     From        From      From\r\n    Years.  all Diseases.

It is only thus that the diminishing\r\nnumber of burials (which ranged from 25,000 to 30,000 during many\r\nyears of the 18th Century) is to be accounted for. In this light we\r\nhave to consider the following table, where we note fewer burials,\r\nless smallpox, less fevers, but more measles.\r\n\r\n            Burials from     From        From      From\r\n    Years.  all Diseases.

It is a fever among fevers, bred and propagated in the same\r\nconditions, and can never be studied apart from its associates\r\nwithout serious misunderstanding.\r\n\r\nThese Bills of Mortality, as compared with the more accurate\r\nstatistics of our own time, are of little value; but, such as\r\nthey are, they are constantly referred to, and their items used,\r\nas by Baron, as pretexts for most unwarrantable assertions. Any\r\ninfluence of Vaccination on the smallpox mortality of 1801-10 was\r\npractically nothing. Vaccination was limited to a few thousands,\r\nand those chiefly of the classes least subject to the disease. The\r\ngreat seething mass of metropolitan squalor, in which smallpox and\r\ntyphus were endemic, was untouched by the vaccine lancet. If the\r\nnew practice did good, it was in discrediting and discouraging the\r\nculture of smallpox in variolous inoculation.\r\n\r\nTo return to the ROYAL JENNERIAN SOCIETY. Its halcyon-days were\r\nof brief duration. Enthusiasm abated, subscriptions fell off,\r\ncases of smallpox after vaccination came to be heard of, and\r\nserious illness and death consequent upon “the benign and harmless\r\noperation.” Opponents waxed bold and could not be silenced. Then\r\njealousies and dissensions began to operate within the Society.\r\nThe financial secretary strove with the medical secretary. Dr.\r\nWalker’s habits and eccentricities, viewed at first with amusement,\r\nexcited irritation and disgust, whilst Jenner’s easy-going mode of\r\nlife and impecuniosity were a source of scandal and distrust. The\r\nclimax was reached in 1806 when Jenner and Walker were set openly\r\nat loggerheads, and a fight to the death ensued.\r\n\r\nWalker, it is to be said, never treated Jenner with respect. Like\r\nPearson he took stock of his merits, and did not rate them highly,\r\nand would not listen to his dictation. “Vaccination,” he used to\r\nobserve, “is extremely simple as to facts, while, as to causes,\r\nit is entirely out of the reach of medical men with all their\r\ntheories.” Jenner, as president of the Medical Council, thought he\r\nhad a right to be obeyed, but Walker was the last man in the world\r\nto yield obedience when he had formed an opposite conviction--\r\n\r\n  Jenner [writes Baron] considered it his duty to admonish him,\r\n  and repeatedly represented to him, in the most friendly manner,\r\n  the mischievous tendency of his innovations. These remonstrances\r\n  were unavailing, and he ceased to have any communication with Dr.\r\n  Walker after the summer of 1805; submitting rather to lament in\r\n  silence the fate of the Society than come before it as a public\r\n  accuser.\r\n\r\nOf course such forbearance could not last long, and instructions\r\nissued by Walker to the Nottingham Vaccine Institution in March,\r\n1806, were made the occasion of an open rupture. Jenner brought\r\nWalker’s conduct under the consideration of the Medical Council,\r\nand secured his condemnation. The question was then referred\r\nto the General Court of the Society on the 25th of July, when a\r\nmotion that Walker he dismissed from his office was negatived by a\r\nmajority of three, Walker being supported by Sir Joseph Banks and\r\nJenner by Dr. Sims. But the victory was not satisfactory to Walker,\r\nand on the 8th of August he put an end to the strife by sending in\r\nhis resignation.\r\n\r\nBaron’s solemn account of the contest must appal every ingenuous\r\nreader. Jenner, it is written, regarded Walker’s proceedings as of\r\n“the most dangerous character,” as “placing in peril the safety of\r\nthe practice,” and “as likely to wreck the Society”; so that had\r\nhe not retired Jenner would have been compelled to withdraw his\r\ncountenance from Salisbury Square. As we read we exclaim, Whatever\r\ndid the dreadful Doctor do? Here is Baron’s answer--\r\n\r\n  It is unnecessary to mention the specific instances of misconduct\r\n  which were established. They regarded even the very name of the\r\n  affection; the method of managing the pustules; the characters of\r\n  correct vaccination; the precautions to be observed in conducting\r\n  the practice, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nMoore states the offence plainly--\r\n\r\n  Walker’s method of taking lymph was to cut open the vesicles, and\r\n  to wipe out the contents with lint, in order to procure the fresh\r\n  secretion. This harsh treatment of infants was the reverse of\r\n  that which he was directed to employ; and as he was unalterable\r\n  in his resolution, it was at length deemed necessary to remove\r\n  him.[132]\r\n\r\nTurning to the _Life of Walker_, by Dr. Epps, we have the\r\ndifference ’twixt Tweedledum and Tweedledee still further\r\nillustrated--\r\n\r\n  Two different modes have been adopted in taking the matter of\r\n  inoculation from the vaccinated subject: one, by making punctures\r\n  round the outer part of the pock, Dr. Jenner’s mode; the other,\r\n  by removing the crust or scab from the centre of the pock,\r\n  wiping out the fluid beneath it, and then taking the matter,\r\n  indiscriminately, from any part of the whole substance of the\r\n  pock, Dr. Walker’s mode.[133]\r\n\r\nAs in brawls and wars generally, the ostensible offence is rarely\r\nthe true or entire offence, so when we revert to the events of\r\n1805-6 we discover that Vaccination was being found out, and that\r\nWalker served Jenner’s purpose opportunely as scape-goat. Walker’s\r\nbehaviour, too, constituted him a convenient victim. Many who\r\ncared nothing for his mode of “taking lymph” had been hurt by his\r\nscorn of their self-importance, and were ready to assist Jenner in\r\neffecting his humiliation. Mr. Cline, the surgeon, after listening\r\nto many speeches against Walker, summed up the indictment, “All\r\nthey complain of are his _dress_ and _address_.” A naval officer,\r\nmeeting Walker on 25th July, said, “I came to town to-day to hold\r\nup my hand in your support. You and Jenner do not agree over some\r\ntrifles, and your enemies wish to turn the fact to your hurt, but\r\nthey have been beaten. Is the man who launches a vessel the only\r\none who can navigate her? If Jenner were to live for fifty years to\r\ncome, he could never have the authority of your experience.”\r\n\r\nJenner’s victory over Walker was utterly disastrous: it destroyed\r\nthe Royal Jennerian Society. The substantial supporters of the\r\nSociety were the adherents of Walker, and with him they seceded,\r\nsecured another house in Salisbury Square, and established THE\r\nLONDON VACCINE INSTITUTION with Walker for manager. The remnant of\r\nthe Jennerian Society appointed James Sheridan Knowles, a young\r\nIrish surgeon, as Walker’s successor, and for distinction purchased\r\nhim the degree of M.D. from St. Andrews. He had the suavity that\r\nWalker disdained, and little else beside. He neglected his duties,\r\nand soon the traffic in the “benign fluid” was transferred to the\r\nnew establishment. Ultimately the lease, fixtures, and furniture\r\nof the Jennerian house were disposed of, and a retreat effected to\r\nhumbler offices, until in 1813 what remained of the Society was\r\nincorporated in Walker’s concern.\r\n\r\nWalker obtained much assistance from members of the Society of\r\nFriends, and the fact affords Moore (Jenner’s apologist) occasion\r\nfor certain sneers. He describes the meetings in Salisbury Square\r\nas--\r\n\r\n  Shaded with the Quakers’ broad-brimmed hats; for their schismatic\r\n  assiduity was most conspicuous, though their primitive meekness\r\n  was indiscernible. In support of their friend, they argued slyly,\r\n  wrangled tumultuously, and voted almost unanimously. Yet, in\r\n  spite of this contentious pertinacity, the turbulent Quaker, on\r\n  the motion of Dr. Jenner, was dismissed from his office, and\r\n  peace was restored.\r\n\r\nDismissed he was not, and the peace that ensued on his resignation\r\nwas destruction. The success of Walker’s Institution (necessarily\r\ndependent on subscriptions) he accounts for by an anecdote like\r\nthis--\r\n\r\n  A noble Duke informed me that on a sultry day a steaming, squab,\r\n  broad-faced man, in a Quaker’s garb, with his hat on his head,\r\n  entered his room, saying, “Friend, I am come on a charitable\r\n  mission to request thy mite.” The Duke, amused with the oddness\r\n  of the salutation, desired him to be seated, and to explain his\r\n  business. The Quaker wilily suppressed all mention of disputes\r\n  in the Jennerian Society, and of the dismissal of Dr. Walker,\r\n  which were the real causes for soliciting this subscription;\r\n  and enlarged tediously on the utility of vaccination, and by\r\n  awkward encomiums on Dr. Jenner, led the Duke to believe that the\r\n  subscription was solicited for a Society approved by him. This\r\n  cunning harangue drew forth the Duke’s purse, which the Quaker\r\n  spying, unrolled his list, and added his Grace’s name as a decoy\r\n  for others; and saying, “Friend, fare thee well,” strutted out\r\n  with an uncouth gait and an air of uprightness. By such artifices\r\n  a large subscription was raised from those who prefer paying to\r\n  inquiry; and in the meantime the Jennerian Society diminished\r\n  in numbers, and, undermined by calumnies, declined to its\r\n  downfall.[134]\r\n\r\nIt is not to be imagined, however, that the collapse of the Royal\r\nJennerian Society disposed of Jenner and his party. There was\r\nJenner to provide for: he could not with decency be forsaken: and\r\nthere was a stock of vaccine virus to be kept up, for which pride\r\nforbade dependence on Walker’s dispensary. It was in vain to appeal\r\nafresh to a benevolent public, whose confidence had gone elsewhere,\r\nand whose suspicions were excited. It was therefore determined to\r\nresort to Government for help. The political influence of the\r\nJennerian party was considerable, and we shall see to what purpose\r\nit was exerted.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF THE TERM VACCINATION.\r\n\r\nA new practice wants a new name, and it was some time before one\r\nwas found for Inoculation with Cowpox. Dr. Walker made use of\r\nVacciolation and to Vacciolate in 1802; but it was Richard Dunning,\r\nsurgeon, of Plymouth, who introduced Vaccination and to Vaccinate.\r\nJenner writing to Dunning, 2nd April, 1804, observed--\r\n\r\n  The useful terms Vaccination and to Vaccinate, are undoubtedly\r\n  yours, and as such I pronounced them at a meeting of the Royal\r\n  Jennerian Society, when an M.D. present mentioned them as\r\n  imported from the Continent.[135]\r\n\r\nVaccination is not as yet a term accepted everywhere. Among the\r\nuneducated we hear of being “cut for the cowpock,” or simply of\r\nbeing “cut.”\r\n\r\nWhilst Vaccination was a useful word, it was, and is, often\r\nmisapplied. Jenner’s prescription of Horsegrease Cowpox was\r\nEquination rather than Vaccination; and when virus from the\r\nhorse was employed neat, Equination was the accurate designation\r\nwithout question. Again, when virus was generated from Smallpox on\r\nheifers, the subsequent inoculation of the human subject was not\r\nVaccination but Variolation, or at least Variolous Vaccination. The\r\nvirus in public use at this day derived from Horsegrease Cowpox,\r\nCowpox, Horsepox, Smallpox, Smallpox Cowpox, etc., etc., inoculated\r\nfrom arm-to-arm, in series prolonged and unsearchable, is called\r\nVaccination; but it is Vaccination in faith or fancy, evidence to\r\nanything but uncertainty being unattainable.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[131] Baron’s _Life of Jenner_, Vol. i. p. 577.\r\n\r\n[132] _History and Practice of Vaccination_, p. 212.

Speaking\r\nto Baron he said--\r\n\r\n  I can compare my feelings to those of no one but Cowper, the\r\n  poet, when his intellect at last gave way to his fears about the\r\n  execution of his office in the House of Lords. It was reading\r\n  Cowper’s Life, I believe, that saved my own senses by putting me\r\n  fully in view of my danger. For many weeks before the meeting\r\n  I began to be agitated, and, as it approached, I was actually\r\n  deprived both of appetite and sleep; and when the day came, I was\r\n  obliged to deaden my sensibility and gain courage by brandy and\r\n  opium. The meeting was at length interrupted by a dissolution of\r\n  Parliament, which sent the leading people to the country; and\r\n  what was at first merely postponed was ultimately abandoned to my\r\n  no small delight and satisfaction.[136]\r\n\r\nSomething of this timidity was no doubt due to his consciousness of\r\nplaying a deceitful part, and to the appropriation of honour and\r\nreward to which he had no just claim. Like many shy men, Jenner\r\ncould be insolent with pen and ink--it was face to face courage\r\nto which he was unequal; and this timidity, with other reasons,\r\naccounted for his failure as a London physician--as “the Cowpox\r\nDoctor,” as he was commonly described. Those whose encouragement\r\nhad helped to lead him to disaster, those who were pleased to\r\nbelieve that he had taught mankind how to escape from smallpox,\r\nand several of his professional brethren, were all concerned to\r\nhelp him out of his difficulties, and, if possible, at the public\r\nexpense. The Duchess of Devonshire wrote to Mr. Angerstein--\r\n\r\n  I had not forgot your kind interest about Jenner. I spoke to the\r\n  Duke, the Prince, and Morpeth, and they will all do what you\r\n  think best; but Morpeth has undertaken to make inquiries whether\r\n  it is not possible to bring his case again before Parliament. He\r\n  thinks if that could be done, it would be more satisfactory than\r\n  any subscription. I desired him to find out how Pitt was _really_\r\n  inclined in the matter, and I only waited the result of these\r\n  inquiries to write to you.\r\n\r\nAt the same time Jenner himself was not inactive, and managed to\r\nadvance his own interest effectually. He came to London, 10th\r\nMay, 1805, and at once saw Lord Egremont, and enlarged upon the\r\nlosses he had incurred in the public service; the result being a\r\ndetermination to appeal afresh to the liberality of the House of\r\nCommons. Moreover he succeeded in winning over the Chancellor of\r\nthe Exchequer in the manner he thus describes--\r\n\r\n  During my residence in town in the summer of 1805, Lady Crewe\r\n  happened in conversation to tell me how much Lord Henry Petty\r\n  wished for a conference with me on the vaccine subject; and\r\n  that she would like to bring us together. We met at her villa\r\n  at Hampstead, and went so fully into the matter that his\r\n  Lordship, convinced of the injury I had sustained, expressed his\r\n  determination to bring something forward in the ensuing session.\r\n  Before the session arrived Mr. Pitt died, and Lord Henry Petty\r\n  became Chancellor of the Exchequer. In the early part of 1806,\r\n  I again saw his Lordship, and found that his ardour in my cause\r\n  had suffered no abatement. This was soon after proved by his\r\n  Lordship’s motion in the House.[137]\r\n\r\nLord Henry brought Jenner’s case before the Commons on the 2nd of\r\nJuly, and recited the fabulous matter communicated to him with\r\nthe force of personal conviction. Vaccination was a preventive of\r\nsmallpox, that loathsome disease which spreads death throughout\r\nthe world. It was in 1777 that Jenner obtained some obscure\r\nknowledge of the peculiar virtue of Vaccine; and from that period\r\nhe meditated profoundly on the subject, accumulated information,\r\nand instituted cautious and decisive experiments. At length he\r\nperfected his discovery, and published it for the benefit of\r\nmankind. Lord Henry then proceeded to relate the triumphs of\r\nVaccination, not only throughout Europe, but China and India!\r\nWherever the practice was introduced, there smallpox diminished\r\nand vanished. There was Vienna, for instance, where the average\r\nmortality from smallpox was 835 annually. Vaccination was commenced\r\nin 1799, and the mortality dropped in 1802 to 61, in 1803 to 27,\r\nand in 1804 to 2. Thus in Vienna there was an annual salvation of\r\n833 human beings. This undoubted fact had made a deep impression on\r\nhis mind [as well it might!] But, alas! what was doing so much good\r\nabroad was neglected and distrusted at home. In the City of London\r\nthe deaths from smallpox had been on an average 1811 annually, and\r\nthis mortality had been gradually reduced by Vaccination to 629.\r\nThrough the diffusion of the disease by variolous inoculation, the\r\ndeaths last year (1805) had been raised from 629 to 1685. This\r\ndreadful destruction of life, especially shocking when a certain\r\npreventive existed, demanded their most serious attention, and in\r\nthe situation he felt bound to propose a plan to bring forward a\r\nmass of evidence, to elicit the truth, and enlighten the public. He\r\nwould therefore move--\r\n\r\n  That an humble Address be presented to His Majesty, praying\r\n  that he will be graciously pleased to direct His Royal College\r\n  of Physicians to inquire into the state of Vaccine Inoculation\r\n  in the United Kingdom, and to report their opinion as to the\r\n  progress it has made, and the causes which have retarded its\r\n  general adoption.\r\n\r\nShould this report from the Physicians corroborate the favourable\r\nopinion of Vaccination entertained by foreign nations, it must\r\ngreatly tend to subdue those prejudices against the practice which\r\nhave been fomented here. And in that case, the House may consider\r\nwhether the ingenious Discoverer has been remunerated conformably\r\nto the liberal spirit and character of this country.\r\n\r\nDr. MATHEWS seconded the motion, and contrasted the safety of the\r\nvaccine with the dangers of variolous inoculation. He had no doubt\r\nthe country would hasten to testify still further its gratitude to\r\nthe learned physician to whom they owed this inestimable benefit.\r\n\r\nMr. WILBERFORCE did not approve of the reference to the College of\r\nPhysicians. He would have preferred an investigation by a committee\r\nof the House, and another committee of the House of Lords. The\r\nopinions of such unbiased persons would be more congenial to\r\nthe feelings of the people, and far more satisfactory than any\r\nmedical report from the College of Physicians. The latter might be\r\nsuspected of being influenced by professional motives, whereas a\r\nreport from the Lords and Commons would be universally received as\r\nproceeding from a pure desire to promote the general good. It did\r\nnot surprise him that Vaccination had made less progress at home\r\nthan abroad. The resistance was due to that curious principle in\r\nthe human mind which accepts what comes from afar with admiration\r\nwhilst what is familiar is neglected and despised. The remedy would\r\nbe found in diffusing information as to the complete success of\r\nVaccination in foreign countries. They would thus disperse those\r\nabsurd prejudices which are engendered and fostered by certain\r\nselfish and interested individuals.\r\n\r\nMr. WINDHAM did not concur in the advice of Mr. Wilberforce to\r\nrefer the matter to a parliamentary committee. It was a question\r\nfor medical men. To a committee of the House the adage might be\r\napplied, _Ne sutor ultra crepidam_. Let them enforce with their\r\napproval the report of the physicians, and then let them proceed\r\nto remunerate that meritorious individual to whom society owed\r\nthe utmost gratitude. He could not help thinking he had not yet\r\nreceived what was due for the expense and trouble the discovery had\r\ncost him.\r\n\r\nMr. BANKS was of a sceptical turn. He wished the motion had been\r\nmade earlier in the session, for then he should have supported\r\nthe suggestion of Mr. Wilberforce. They wished to know whether\r\nVaccination really did afford reasonable security from smallpox.\r\nIt was not a question for medical men for which the House was\r\nincompetent. They were as capable of determining the point, and\r\nsetting it clearly before the public, as the most learned body that\r\never existed. He wished too, since the motion would be carried,\r\nthat the Royal College of Surgeons might be united with the\r\nPhysicians in the production of the report. As for Dr. Jenner, if\r\nVaccination were as efficacious as asserted, he might be left to\r\nfind his reward in its practice.\r\n\r\nLord HENRY PETTY in summing up the debate expressed his\r\nsatisfaction with the general approval extended to his motion.\r\nHe did not think the House competent to form a judgment on\r\nVaccination. They could not decide whether cowpox was genuine or\r\nspurious, or whether the affection resulting from its inoculation\r\nwas regular or otherwise; nor could they determine whether\r\neruptions that might break out after Vaccination were induced by\r\nthe operation, or were due to other causes. Such delicate questions\r\ncould only be solved by medical men. As for the proposal to annex\r\nthe Royal College of Surgeons to that of the Physicians, it was\r\nsuperfluous. The College of Physicians would not only consult\r\nthe Surgeons, but the Medical Colleges of Scotland and Ireland\r\nlikewise. If the report should prove favourable, it would then be\r\nhis duty to propose that remuneration be awarded to Dr. Jenner for\r\nhis inestimable discovery.\r\n\r\nThe motion was then put from the Chair and agreed to unanimously.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to remark that the report of the College of\r\nPhysicians was a mere formality toward a vote of credit for\r\nJenner’s relief. He lay heavy on many hands, and none were more\r\nanxious to be relieved from the pressure than certain influential\r\nmembers of the College whose report was solicited. The operation\r\nwas skilfully planned for the end designed, and Lord Henry Petty\r\nallowed himself to be primed and applied with singular facility:\r\nbut public men have often to deliver as of themselves what is\r\ncommunicated by others, and to stand responsible for absurdities of\r\nwhich they are unconscious.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[136] Baron’s _Life of Jenner_, vol. ii. p. 162.\r\n\r\n[137] Baron’s _Life of Jenner_, vol. ii. p. 55.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nREPORT OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Report of the Physicians appeared on the 10th April, 1807, a\r\nverbose document, wherein assertion and conjecture were awkwardly\r\nintermingled. As to the extension of the practice, it was said--\r\n\r\n  During eight years which have elapsed since Dr. Jenner made his\r\n  discovery public, the progress of Vaccination has been rapid, not\r\n  only in all parts of the United Kingdom, but in every quarter\r\n  of the civilised world. In the British Islands some hundred\r\n  thousands have been vaccinated; in our possessions in the East\r\n  Indies upwards of 800,000, and among the nations of Europe the\r\n  practice has become general.\r\n\r\n  Professional men have submitted it to the fairest trials, and the\r\n  public for the most part have received it without prejudice. The\r\n  testimony in its favour has been most strong and satisfactory,\r\n  and the practice of it, though it has received a check in some\r\n  quarters, appears to be upon the increase in most parts of the\r\n  United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nFrom the Report it appeared that the opposition to Vaccination\r\nproceeded from the Inoculators; and the document may be described\r\nas a charge against the old practice as much as a positive defence\r\nof the new--\r\n\r\n  However beneficial the inoculation of the Smallpox may have been\r\n  to individuals, it appears to have kept up a constant source of\r\n  contagion, which has been the means of increasing the number\r\n  of deaths by what is called the natural disease. It cannot be\r\n  doubted that this mischief has been extended by the inconsiderate\r\n  manner in which great numbers of persons, even since the\r\n  introduction of Vaccination, are every year inoculated with\r\n  Smallpox, and afterwards required to attend two or three times\r\n  a-week at the place of inoculation, through every stage of their\r\n  illness.\r\n\r\nSome Inoculators asserted that Vaccination produced “new,\r\nunheard-of, and monstrous diseases,” and made use of pictures to\r\nexcite terror and disgust--\r\n\r\n  Publications with such representations have been widely\r\n  circulated, and though they originated either in gross\r\n  ignorance, or wilful misrepresentation, yet have they lessened\r\n  the confidence of many, particularly of the lower classes, in\r\n  Vaccination.\r\n\r\nWhatever the character of Vaccination--had the claim made in\r\nits favour been a true claim, still the chief resistance to its\r\npractice would have consisted in the common apathy--\r\n\r\n  The lower orders of society can hardly be induced to adopt\r\n  precautions against evils which may be at a distance; nor can\r\n  it be expected from them, if these precautions be attended with\r\n  expense. Unless, therefore, from the immediate dread of epidemic\r\n  Smallpox, neither Vaccination or Inoculation appears at any time\r\n  to have been general, and when the cause of terror has passed by\r\n  the public have relapsed into indifference. It is not easy to\r\n  suggest a remedy for an evil so deeply implanted in human nature.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion was, however, made that Vaccination should be\r\noffered gratis, but at the same time it was the opinion of the\r\nCollege that until Variolous Inoculation was superseded or\r\nprohibited, “it would be impossible to prevent the constant\r\nrecurrence of Natural Smallpox.”\r\n\r\nThe recommendation of Vaccination gratis provoked the wrath of Dr.\r\nMoseley--\r\n\r\n  Gratis! [he exclaimed]: Why, every person knows that for years\r\n  past in almost every street of London, signs or boards on the\r\n  sides of houses, or on Methodists’ shops, or in apothecaries’\r\n  windows, have invited the ignorant multitude to gratuitous\r\n  Vaccination. I have seen as many gratis Cowpox hand-bills, gratis\r\n  puffs, gratis pathetic sermons and addresses, and gratis station\r\n  advertisements as would load an ox. What does the College think\r\n  of the mountebank Jennerian placard, dispersed on walls and\r\n  alleys, and among all the blackguard public houses in town and\r\n  country, and hung up in the shop or parlour of every Cowpoxer in\r\n  England with Their Majesties’ Names and those of Their August\r\n  Family audaciously emblazoned upon it?[138]\r\n\r\nThe Report of the College is interesting as a historic confession\r\nand a mark of progress. The physicians who drew it up were the\r\nsame men who in 1800 professed their unlimited confidence in\r\nVaccination, whilst as yet they knew little about it, proclaiming\r\nin the newspapers that they considered it their duty to declare--\r\n\r\n  _That those persons who have had the Cowpox are perfectly secure\r\n  from the future infection of the Smallpox._\r\n\r\nFrom a profession so unqualified an absolute retractation was not\r\nto be expected; but experience had begotten caution, and it is\r\ninstructive to remark with what qualifications the retreat from the\r\noriginal position was attempted. Thus--\r\n\r\n  The security derived from Vaccination _if not absolutely\r\n  perfect_ is as nearly so as can perhaps be expected from any\r\n  human discovery; for among several hundred thousand cases, with\r\n  the results of which the College has been made acquainted, _the\r\n  number of alleged failures has been surprisingly small_, so much\r\n  so as to form no reasonable objection to the general adoption of\r\n  Vaccination.\r\n\r\nThe Report was not the deliverance of men possessed with the\r\nconfidence of 1800: throughout there was manifest the failing\r\nconviction which evades responsibility and seeks for confirmation\r\nfrom sources external to itself. After a reference to the Variolous\r\nTest, the Report ran on--\r\n\r\n  It appears from numerous observations communicated to the\r\n  College, that those who have been vaccinated are secure from the\r\n  contagion of epidemic Smallpox. Towns and districts of country\r\n  in which Vaccination had been general, have afterwards had\r\n  Smallpox prevalent on all sides of them without suffering from\r\n  the contagion. There are also in the evidence a few examples of\r\n  epidemic Smallpox having been subdued by a general Vaccination.\r\n\r\nThe liability to confound coincidence with cause was not unknown\r\nin 1807, and might have been suggested as a possible explanation\r\nof the cessation of a variolous epidemic contemporaneously with\r\nVaccination; although at the present day Vaccination, when Smallpox\r\nis epidemic, is known to do little else than invite and extend the\r\nmalady.\r\n\r\nHow the general (that was to say partial) Vaccination of certain\r\ntowns and country districts secured universal exemption from\r\nSmallpox, the Physicians failed to explain. Extraordinary tales\r\nof Vicarious Vaccination were current and piously received. If a\r\nfraction of an urban or rural community happened to be vaccinated\r\n(usually a fraction least likely to be troubled with Smallpox\r\nin any event) and Smallpox did not break out, or did not widely\r\nprevail, the salvation of the community was ascribed to the\r\nVicarious Vaccination. The phenomenon has, strange to say, escaped\r\nthe attention of theologians, although medical men constantly\r\nattest its occurrence.\r\n\r\nRuefully was it conceded that Vaccination was not an absolute\r\npreservative from Smallpox, but the pain of concession was softened\r\nwith the plea of mitigation--\r\n\r\n  In _almost_ every case where Smallpox has succeeded Vaccination,\r\n  the disease has varied much from its ordinary course; it has\r\n  neither been the same in violence, nor in the duration of its\r\n  symptoms, but has, _with very few exceptions_, been remarkably\r\n  mild, as if the Smallpox had been deprived, by the previous\r\n  vaccine disease, of all its usual malignity.\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying, that such a statement was quackish romance.\r\nHow could a physician know that any case of Smallpox had been made\r\nmilder by Vaccination? for how could he know how severe the disease\r\nwould have been without Vaccination? Any ground of comparison\r\nwas wanting. Smallpox is an eruptive fever of wide degrees of\r\nintensity--slight as to be a trivial ailment, severe as to be\r\ninevitably fatal. “So true,” wrote Dr. Wagstaffe in 1722, “is that\r\ncommon observation, that there is one sort in which a nurse cannot\r\nkill, and another which even a physician cannot cure.” Yet every\r\ncase of mild Smallpox after Cowpox came into fashion was placed to\r\nthe credit of Vaccination!\r\n\r\n  Some writers [the Report continues] have greatly undervalued\r\n  the security Vaccination affords, while others have considered\r\n  it to be of a temporary nature only; but if any reliance is to\r\n  be placed on the statements laid before the College, its power\r\n  of protecting the human body from Smallpox, _though not perfect\r\n  indeed_, is abundantly sufficient to recommend it to the prudent\r\n  and dispassionate. The opinion that Vaccination affords but a\r\n  temporary security is supported by no analogy in Nature, nor by\r\n  the facts which have hitherto occurred.\r\n\r\nThe analogy of Nature was a treacherous support, whilst the\r\nPhysicians did not foresee the time when their successors would\r\nplead the fact of the temporary security of Vaccination as a reason\r\nfor systematic Re-Vaccination.\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to discern between the lines of the Report a\r\nspirit of doubt and hesitation. Those who framed it had gone too\r\nfar to turn back; there was Jenner on their hands; and a public\r\nready to hoot if there was any open apostasy. The outlook at home\r\nwas not encouraging, but there was the Continent, yea more, the\r\nwide world itself wherein to cover the reproach of failure--\r\n\r\n  They could not be insensible [said the Physicians] to the\r\n  confirmation they receive not only from the introduction of\r\n  Vaccination into every part of Europe, _but throughout the vast\r\n  Continents of Asia and America_.\r\n\r\nThe vast Continents of Asia and America! A fine phrase--a very fine\r\nphrase, with more comfort in it than scoffers might imagine.\r\n\r\nIn the Report we detect one good service, namely, the explosion\r\nof Jenner’s fiction about Spurious Cowpox. When Vaccination was\r\nfirst brought forward, cases were adduced of Smallpox after\r\nCowpox. Jenner at once asserted that the Cowpox in such instances\r\nmust have been spurious, for Smallpox after genuine Cowpox was\r\nimpossible; and Spurious Cowpox was thenceforward freely used to\r\nbaffle inquirers and to account for failures. Spurious Cowpox\r\nserved the ends of the Vaccinators magnificently, but by and by\r\nit began to have awkward consequences. Genuine Cowpox was said to\r\nbe harmless--it was the Spurious that was ineffective or worked\r\nmischief; and the Inoculators plied the terror of Spurious Pox\r\nagainst Vaccination. It therefore became necessary to clear\r\nSpurious Cowpox out of the way, and Jenner, before the College of\r\nPhysicians, pressed upon the point, “owned up,” as Americans say,\r\nand authorised the following explanation--\r\n\r\n  Some deviations from the usual course have occasionally occurred\r\n  in Vaccination, which the Author of the practice has called\r\n  Spurious Cowpox, _by which the public have been misled, as if\r\n  there were a true and a false Cowpox_; but it appears that\r\n  nothing more was meant than to express irregularity or difference\r\n  from that common form and progress of the vaccine pustule from\r\n  which its efficacy is inferred.\r\n\r\nMark! Here was a third definition of Spurious Cowpox by Jenner.\r\n\r\n_First_, in the _Inquiry_ of 1798, he described Spurious Cowpox\r\nas eruptions on the cow underived from horsegrease, producing no\r\nerysipelas when inoculated on the human subject, and without effect\r\nagainst Smallpox. True Cowpox was generated from horsegrease, and\r\nfrom horsegrease only.\r\n\r\n_Second_, in the _Origin of the Vaccine Inoculation_ of 1801 all\r\nreference to horsegrease was dropped for commercial reasons, whilst\r\nthe existence of Spurious Cowpox was reasserted “as some varieties\r\nof spontaneous eruptions upon the cow.”\r\n\r\n_Third_, before the Physicians in 1807, he removed the spurious\r\ndisease from the cow altogether, saying, nothing more was meant by\r\nSpurious Cowpox than variations in the form and progress of vaccine\r\npustules on the arms of the vaccinated!\r\n\r\nIn short, to vary the phrase of Betsy Prig, “There never was no\r\nSpurious Cowpox.” Slippery, very slippery, was the immortal Jenner.\r\n\r\nWith the report of the Royal College of Physicians were delivered\r\nreports from the London College of Surgeons, and from the Edinburgh\r\nand Dublin Colleges of Physicians and of Surgeons.\r\n\r\nThe report from the London College of Surgeons was considered\r\nmost unsatisfactory, and could its tenor have been foreseen,\r\nthe Jennerians might never have asked for it. 1100 circulars\r\nwere dispatched on 15th December, 1806, to all the members of\r\nthe College whose addresses were known in the United Kingdom,\r\nsubmitting the following questions--\r\n\r\n  1st. How many persons have you vaccinated?\r\n\r\n  2nd. Have any of your patients had Smallpox after Vaccination?\r\n\r\n  3rd. Have any bad effects occurred in your experience in\r\n  consequence of Vaccination? and if so, what are they?\r\n\r\n  4th. Is the practice of Vaccination increasing or decreasing in\r\n  your neighbourhood? if decreasing, to what cause do you impute it?\r\n\r\nTo the 1100 circulars only 426 replies were received. Why nearly\r\ntwo-thirds of the members kept silent when at the outset they were\r\nconverted in multitude to Vaccination, was left unexplained. The\r\nreplies were thus summarised by the Board on 17th March, 1807--\r\n\r\n  The number of persons stated in such letters to have been\r\n  vaccinated, is 164,381.\r\n\r\n  The number of cases in which Smallpox had followed Vaccination is\r\n  56.\r\n\r\n  The Board think it proper to remark under this head, that, in the\r\n  enumeration of cases in which Smallpox has succeeded Vaccination,\r\n  they have included none but those in which the subject was\r\n  vaccinated by the surgeon reporting the facts.\r\n\r\n  The bad consequences which have arisen from Vaccination are--\r\n\r\n    66 cases of eruption of the skin, and\r\n    24 of inflammation of the arm, whereof\r\n     3 proved fatal.\r\n\r\nVaccination, in the greater number of Counties from which reports\r\nhave been received, appears to be increasing: in the Metropolis it\r\nis on the decrease.\r\n\r\nThe principal reasons assigned for the decrease are--\r\n\r\n    Imperfect Vaccination,\r\n    Instances of Smallpox after Vaccination,\r\n    Supposed bad consequences,\r\n    Publications against the practice,\r\n    Popular prejudices.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Edinburgh College of Physicians disowned\r\nacquaintance with Vaccination, the practice being entirely in the\r\nhands of surgeons and other practitioners--\r\n\r\n  With a view, however, to publish their conviction of the\r\n  immense benefits which have been, and which will in future be\r\n  derived to the world, from Inoculation for the Cowpox, they had\r\n  spontaneously and unanimously elected Dr. Jenner an honorary\r\n  Fellow of their College, a mark of distinction which they very\r\n  rarely confer, and which they confine almost exclusively to\r\n  Foreign Physicians of the first eminence.\r\n\r\nThe report of the College of Surgeons, dated 3rd March, 1807, left\r\nnothing for the Jennerians to desire. The Edinburgh surgeons were\r\nsatisfied from their own experience that Vaccination constituted\r\na permanent security from Smallpox, and they had observed no ill\r\nconsequences from the practice. Vaccination commenced in Edinburgh\r\nin 1801, and was now so general in the city--\r\n\r\n  That for two or three years past, Smallpox has been reckoned\r\n  rather a rare occurrence, even among the lower order of the\r\n  inhabitants, _unless in some particular quarters about twelve\r\n  months ago_. Among the higher ranks of the inhabitants the\r\n  disease is unknown.\r\n\r\nRare, unless in some quarters about a year ago! We turn to the\r\nreport of the Edinburgh Dispensary for 1805, and there we read--\r\n\r\n  The loathsome disease has unfortunately been very prevalent in\r\n  several quarters of the city.\r\n\r\nAnd this coincidently with extensive Vaccination to which\r\napparently there was no active opposition! We have also to remember\r\nin this connection the statement of Professor Alexander Monro in\r\n1765, that “the inhabitants of Scotland generally have Smallpox\r\nin their infancy or childhood; very few adults being seen in\r\nthis disease”; and that in Edinburgh, with conditions strongly\r\nfavourable to Smallpox, the mortality from the disease was on an\r\naverage little more than a hundred a year. The Edinburgh physicians\r\nknew nothing practically of Vaccination, and we see how the\r\nSurgeons, who did know, shaped their evidence.\r\n\r\nThe Dublin College of Physicians echoed the fashionable opinion\r\n“that Cowpox Inoculation was safe, and fully answered its purpose.”\r\nThey were “willing to allow that doubtful cases had occurred of\r\nSmallpox after Vaccination, but on minute investigation, these\r\nsupposed instances originated generally in misrepresentation,\r\nor the difficulty of discriminating between Smallpox and other\r\neruptions.” Rather awkwardly, seeing how the opposite opinion was\r\nin vogue, they professed their faith in Variolous Inoculation--\r\n\r\n  The Smallpox is rendered a much less formidable disease in\r\n  Ireland by the frequency of Inoculation for it, than in other\r\n  parts of His Majesty’s dominions, where prejudices against\r\n  Inoculation have prevailed. Hence parents, not unnaturally,\r\n  object to the introduction of a new disease, in the shape\r\n  of Vaccination, preferring to trust to the practice with the\r\n  mildness and safety of which they are well acquainted.\r\n\r\nThe Dublin College of Surgeons showed themselves more fully\r\nabreast of the time. They had nothing to say for Inoculation, but\r\ntestified their confidence in Vaccination, and how its practice was\r\nincreasing in Ireland. From 1800 to 1806 a total of 14,335 had been\r\n“inoculated with vaccine infection” at the Dublin institutions, and\r\nmany elsewhere--\r\n\r\n  Cowpox has been found to be a mild disease, and rarely attended\r\n  with danger, or any alarming symptom, and _the few cases\r\n  of Smallpox which have occurred in Ireland after supposed\r\n  Vaccination_, have been satisfactorily proved _to have arisen\r\n  from accidental circumstances_.\r\n\r\nArisen from accidental circumstances! Thus was the divine\r\nillumination of experience veiled and denied!\r\n\r\nFortified with this budget of questionable evidence, the Government\r\nproceeded to claim from the House of Commons a second endowment for\r\nJenner.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[138] _Review of Report on Vaccination._ By Benjamin Moseley.\r\nLondon, 1808.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nJENNER RELIEVED--1807.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhilst the Royal College of Physicians were preparing their\r\nreport, there was perturbation in the political world. Dull\r\nand bigoted George III. refusing on the pretext of his oath to\r\nconcede to Roman Catholics the rights of citizens, a change of\r\nadministration ensued, and Mr. Perceval, a man after the King’s own\r\nheart, replaced Lord Henry Petty as Chancellor of the Exchequer,\r\nand proceeded to give effect to the plan for relieving Jenner; a\r\npurpose for which the report “On the State of Vaccine Inoculation\r\nin the United Kingdom” was merely a blind.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th July, 1807, the House of Commons being in Committee\r\nof Supply, Mr. PERCEVAL moved that Dr. Jenner be awarded a second\r\nsum of £10,000 for his matchless discovery. Smallpox was one\r\nof the greatest afflictions of mankind, from which hardly any\r\none escaped. For this dreadful malady, Jenner had invented a\r\npreventive, unknown before, or if known, which had never been\r\npublished. He did not therefore think the Committee would consider\r\nhis proposal extravagant; indeed it was rather an act of justice\r\nthan of liberality. Those who had read the Report of the Physicians\r\nwould recognise the immense advantages of the new practice. As for\r\nits inconveniences, they were as nothing to those which attended\r\nVariolous Inoculation, and the few mistakes recorded were due\r\nto ignorance and carelessness. It might be objected by those\r\nwho adhered to Mr. Malthus, that nothing was gained by saving\r\nlives from pestilence; for deaths were not losses where means of\r\nsubsistence were inadequate; but for his part he would disregard\r\nthe argument even if it were true. It was much better to follow the\r\ndictates of their hearts, and preserve life whenever it was within\r\ntheir power. He had often heard that the true riches of a state\r\nwere its inhabitants. But he would not attempt to measure Jenner’s\r\naward by the number of lives that his invention would preserve to\r\nthe world. If he did so, what sum would they have to offer! All he\r\nneed say was, that the £10,000 proposed represented no more than a\r\nmoderate acknowledgment of labour and genius devoted to the service\r\nof humanity.\r\n\r\nMr. SHAW LEFEVRE opposed the motion. He had thought the former\r\napplication for £20,000 excessive, and had concurred with those\r\nwho reduced it to £10,000. He had moreover acquiesced in the\r\nsmaller sum by reason of his faith in the report of the Committee\r\nof the House on the New Inoculation, but he now discovered that\r\nmany of the statements in that report were erroneous. It attested\r\nthat Vaccination was an infallible preventive of smallpox, whilst\r\nthe report of the Surgeons now admits 56 failures! The first\r\nreport stated that no disease followed Vaccination, whilst now\r\nit is confessed that scrofula and other alarming symptoms are its\r\noccasional sequences! The report thus prejudicial to Vaccination\r\nnevertheless argues in its favour, and he would like to call\r\nwitnesses to the bar of the House who would make manifest still\r\nfurther its inconsistencies and inaccuracies. At this late period\r\nof the session, it was not right to vote away such an amount of\r\npublic money. [Such “late periods” are, however, always selected\r\nfor jobs.] Besides, it was generally known that Benjamin Jesty\r\nof Worth in Dorsetshire discovered the use of cowpox long before\r\nJenner, and if the House was resolved to be liberal, the reward\r\nshould be shared with Jesty, or with Jesty’s family. He should\r\noppose the vote, but he did not say that he would always do so. His\r\npurpose was to gain time for more careful inquiry.\r\n\r\nLord HENRY PETTY, who had first moved in the matter, came to\r\nhis successor’s support. He had no doubt as to the efficacy of\r\nVaccination, nor as to Jenner being its discoverer. His difficulty\r\nwas to find a rule for the justice of the case; for whoever\r\nconsidered the value of the discovery must perceive that it would\r\nbe impossible for them to deal generously with the discoverer. His\r\nservice to mankind was entirely beyond any financial estimate.\r\nIt was objected that Vaccination was not infallible. He replied\r\nthat absolute, never-failing perfection ought not to be expected\r\nfrom any human device: they should rest well satisfied in the\r\napproximation to infallibility that belonged to Vaccination. Its\r\ndaily benefits were numberless. Multitudes of seamen, soldiers,\r\nand citizens of every description had been saved by it, and in\r\ncontemplating its future effects on the human race, the mind was\r\nlost in amazement and gratitude. How then should they presume to\r\ntalk of liberality towards Jenner, the benefactor! They should\r\nrecollect how he stands in the estimation of the world, how they\r\nwere acting in view of all nations, and how their own characters\r\nwere at stake in their demeanour towards him. As to Malthus there\r\nwas a misapprehension. He had taught nothing that forbade the\r\nextinction of an infectious disease which so greatly reduced human\r\nhappiness. In their concern for Vaccination, the House should not\r\nforget the mischief that was still wrought by inoculation with\r\nsmallpox. Zealous as he was for the new practice, he had no wish to\r\nmeddle with what others might imagine (however absurdly) tended to\r\ntheir own preservation and that of their families, but no one had a\r\nright to endanger the lives of others. It was proved beyond dispute\r\nthat those who were inoculated with smallpox diffused the fatal\r\ncontagion by going abroad, or being carried abroad. He thought,\r\ntherefore, it was not only the right, but the duty of the State to\r\noblige those who were infected with smallpox to keep within doors\r\nuntil complete recovery. He would not move an amendment to the\r\nresolution, but would have no hesitation in acceding to a larger\r\nsum.\r\n\r\nGeneral TARLETON could not withhold his tribute of praise from\r\nthe author of this blessing to mankind. To his knowledge, it had\r\nsaved the lives of many in his Majesty’s service. Soldiers could\r\nmarch and perform every military duty when under the process of\r\nvaccination. It had been said that gentlemen in the army had no\r\nrespect for anything save success in war, but he thought that many\r\nofficers knew how to admire Jenner, the preserver of millions, and\r\nto allow that in future ages his glory would exceed the renown of\r\nthe greatest warriors.\r\n\r\nMr. STURGES BOURNE denounced the practice of inoculating\r\nout-patients at the Smallpox Hospital whereby the disease was\r\nsystematically perpetuated and diffused throughout the community.\r\nHe thought the legislature would be as much justified in taking\r\nmeasures to prevent this evil by restraint, as a man would be in\r\nsnatching a firebrand out of the hands of a maniac just as he was\r\ngoing to set fire to a city.\r\n\r\nMr. HAWKINS BROWNE confessed with shame that he had voted for\r\n£10,000 instead of £20,000 in 1802; but at that time he little\r\nknew the extent of Jenner’s service to the human race.\r\n\r\nMr. EDWARD MORRIS did not think that even what had been said\r\nsufficiently set forth their debt of gratitude to Jenner. His\r\ndiscovery afforded a reasonable expectation of the extermination\r\nof smallpox, and the merit of the transcendent discovery was all\r\nhis own. Inoculation in the old mode mitigated the disease in a\r\nfew, and spread it in full fury over many. It was therefore a\r\ncurse to mankind instead of a blessing. The Smallpox Hospital in\r\nits practice of inoculation, was a source of pestilence and a\r\nmultiplier of victims to this deplorable distemper. The pre-eminent\r\ndistinction of Vaccination was that it preserved its subject and\r\ninjured no one. This unspeakable blessing they owed to Jenner,\r\nnor had the least improvement been effected upon his original and\r\ncarefully matured prescription. They were bound to consider how\r\nhe had abandoned the lucrative pursuit of his profession, and\r\nsurrendered many years of his life for the good of his country and\r\nmankind. He would therefore submit an amendment to the resolution\r\nbefore the Committee, that the grant be £20,000 instead of £10,000,\r\nto mark their sense of Jenner’s merits and to place him in a state\r\nof independence.\r\n\r\nThe amendment was warmly supported by Mr. Wilberforce, Mr. Windham,\r\nSir John Sebright, and Mr. Herbert.\r\n\r\nMr. PERCEVAL, as Chancellor of the Exchequer, stood to his\r\nresolution, but with indifferent arguments. It was without\r\nprecedent that a vote recommended by Government should be thus\r\nincreased. He admitted that Jenner was entitled to much more than\r\nthey could afford, but it was also without precedent that so great\r\na sum as £30,000 (inclusive of the former vote) should be bestowed\r\non any discoverer.\r\n\r\nMr. WILLIAM SMITH would not submit to these objections. He recited\r\nthe triumphs of Vaccination in Asia and America, and said it was\r\ntrue as of old that a prophet had no honour in his own country.\r\n[An observation singularly inapplicable to Jenner.] He urged the\r\nCommittee to vote for the larger sum, and said that whilst the\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer might in his public capacity protest,\r\nyet in his secret heart he would not be displeased if overborne by\r\nthe sentiment of the House, of the country, and of the world.\r\n\r\nMr. WHITBREAD begged the Committee to bear in mind that Jenner\r\nhad scorned to monopolise Vaccination, and had thereby sacrificed\r\na great fortune. He called on the House to vote for the larger\r\nsum. Vaccination furnished the means for lessening the poor rate.\r\nReduced smallpox signified fewer deaths, fewer orphans, fewer\r\nwidows. Vaccination meant better health for the poor and more money\r\nin the pockets of the rich. They would excuse this appeal of his\r\nto the cupidity of the landed interest inasmuch as he had been\r\nanticipated in the exhibition of loftier considerations. He also\r\nwished to relieve the House from a renewal of this question. Let\r\nthem reward Jenner once for all, and liberally: and remember that\r\nwhat was called economy in this connection, if practised by the\r\nHouse, would be, in the eye of the world, their disgrace.\r\n\r\nOthers spoke in a similar strain, and when the House divided, 60\r\nvoted for Mr. Morris’s amendment, and 47 against it, £20,000 being\r\ncarried by a majority of 13. Including the £10,000 voted in 1802,\r\nJenner was thus awarded £30,000 of public money, in times, too, of\r\nwar and scarcity.\r\n\r\nThe debate, it will be observed, was conducted in a House of\r\n107 members at a late period of the session, and the variations\r\namong the speakers consisted in degrees of extravagance and\r\ncredulity. The fabulous matter as to Jenner personally affords\r\ncurious evidence of the manner in which legends originate in the\r\npresence of contemporaries, and how they come to be repeated with\r\nthe fervour of good faith by men whose competence and honesty\r\nmight be taken for unimpeachable. Jenner’s party had whipped\r\nup their adherents, and the issue was sedulously arranged for;\r\nbut because they had their way it need not be assumed that it\r\nwas necessary to circumvent any active adversaries. Apathy was\r\ntheir chief difficulty. There was little to be got out of cowpox\r\nby the ordinary politician; and then, as now, the average M.P.\r\nrarely committed himself to any project that did not obviously\r\nmake for his popularity. As for the enthusiasm for Vaccination\r\ndisplayed by the speakers in the House, we have to recollect\r\nthat they were not converts to the practice _per se_. No really\r\nnew discovery was ever received with such an instant chorus of\r\napprobation by the mob, educated or uneducated. They were one and\r\nall bred under the severe and dangerous practice of Variolous\r\nInoculation, whereof Vaccination was no more than a modification\r\nwith a seductive promise of equal or greater security from\r\nsmallpox, and exemption from its perils and annoyances. Unless this\r\nprepossession be allowed for, the conduct of Parliament toward\r\nJenner cannot be rightly understood. There was not a word uttered\r\nagainst Vaccination from the ground which physiologists at this\r\nday occupy, for that ground, in a scientific sense, was as yet\r\nunknown. Smallpox was a mysterious visitation to be mysteriously\r\ndealt with--dodged, if possible, by medical artifice; and not, as\r\nwe are persuaded, a crisis of impurity in the blood induced by foul\r\nconditions of life, which cannot be better disposed of than in the\r\ncourse of nature by eruptive fever. If we could suppress smallpox\r\n(in any other way than by the removal of its causes) we should\r\nmerely alter its manifestation and have to accept it in some other\r\nand aggravated form of disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nVACCINATION ESTABLISHED AND ENDOWED.\r\n\r\n\r\nJenner provided for, his adherents had yet another end to achieve,\r\nnamely, their own release from the burden of the Royal Jennerian\r\nSociety, paralysed by the secession of Dr. Walker and the Friends\r\nand the establishment of the London Vaccine Institution. At first\r\nthey had endeavoured to discredit the new Institution, even to\r\nthe extent of distributing hand-bills like the following in the\r\nstreets--\r\n\r\n\r\n  A CAUTION.\r\n\r\n  To persons desirous of obtaining INOCULATION for the Cowpox\r\n  Gratis under the sanction of\r\n\r\n    THE ROYAL JENNERIAN SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n  Whereas, Doctor JOHN WALKER has, under various pretences,\r\n  obstructed persons going to the Central House of this Society,\r\n  the Public are hereby warned to be upon their guard against any\r\n  insidious representations, the connection between Dr. WALKER and\r\n  the Society having ceased, and Dr. KNOWLES having been appointed\r\n  the Resident Inoculator at the Society’s House, No. 14 Salisbury\r\n  Square.\r\n\r\n  _By Order of the Directors and Medical Council, 9th October,\r\n  1806._\r\n\r\nIt was all in vain. Walker was preferred to Sheridan Knowles\r\nbacked by Jenner, whose friends had no liking for the support of\r\nthe Society out of their own pockets. It was therefore planned\r\nto resort to Parliament for an annual subsidy so as dispense\r\nwith the necessity of subscriptions. The managers of the London\r\nVaccine Institution, learning what was on foot, naturally argued\r\nthat if Government was to be thus propitious, it was they who had\r\nthe better claim to assistance, and therefore prepared a petition\r\nsetting forth their exertions in spreading Vaccine Inoculation.\r\nThis interference with their scheme filled the Jennerians with\r\nfury, and Mr. JOHN FULLER undertook to speak their mind in the\r\nHouse of Commons. When, therefore, on 2nd June, 1808, Sir THOMAS\r\nTURTON presented the petition, FULLER sprang to his feet and\r\ndenounced it, saying a grosser forgery had never been submitted to\r\nthe House.\r\n\r\nThe SPEAKER interposed. The petition had not been read. When it\r\nwas, the House would be enabled to judge of its contents. Mr.\r\nFULLER resumed his seat amid general laughter. The petition having\r\nbeen read--\r\n\r\nMr. FULLER apologised for his abruptness. The petition was a\r\ngross cheat, a wicked trick to swindle the public; or, if it was\r\nnot absolute swindling, it went very near the wind. When they\r\ncame to solicit his subscription, he thought they represented\r\nsome respectable corporation, but what did they turn out to be?\r\nA parcel of Quakers, or Presbyterians, or whatever else they\r\nwere called. They had got five guineas from him, but the moment\r\nhe detected them, he threatened them with a Bow Street officer\r\nand a charge of swindling, which soon frightened them into a\r\nre-delivery of his money. What a shame it was to see the cause\r\nof such fellows espoused by any man in that House! He did not\r\nsuppose the Honourable Baronet shared in their gains, and he might\r\nlaugh as he pleased, and spout like a lawyer, but it was a poor\r\nway to show himself off for the sake of a little notoriety among\r\nsuch despicable sectaries. He hoped the House would not lend any\r\ncountenance to the imposture.\r\n\r\nSir THOMAS TURTON good humouredly replied, that the Jennerian\r\nSociety, in whose interest the preceding speaker exhibited so\r\nmuch untempered zeal, was not instituted till 1803. The original\r\nVaccine Pock Institution was established by Dr. Pearson in 1799.\r\nThe Institution to which the petition referred was established\r\nin 1806, chiefly by members of the Society of Friends, a sect to\r\nwhose virtuous principles and behaviour it was his privilege to\r\nbear testimony. Since 1806 the Institution had communicated the\r\nvaccine matter to 81,000 persons in every situation of life. The\r\npetitioners only desired to have the facts they adduced inquired\r\ninto, and hoped for public aid only in the event of being entitled\r\nto it on public grounds.\r\n\r\nThis application for assistance by Walker’s Institution rendered\r\nits concession to the Jennerian Society impossible: it was not for\r\nthe Government to get into hot water by showing favour to either;\r\nand as both could not be subsidised, it was determined to vary the\r\napplication, and to ask the House of Commons to provide means for\r\nthe maintenance of a new and independent institution from which\r\n“the Genuine Vaccine Virus could be distributed without expense\r\nthroughout the British dominions.” Mr. GEORGE ROSE, Treasurer to\r\nthe Navy, took charge of the measure, which he introduced to the\r\nHouse on 9th June, 1808. After dealing with a notorious failure of\r\nVaccination at Ringwood, he proceeded to observe, that whilst it\r\ncould no longer be said that Vaccination was a certain security\r\nagainst Smallpox in all cases, yet the evidence showed that the\r\nfailures were not one in 300. He would therefore move that the\r\nHouse having the testimony of the Colleges of Physicians and\r\nSurgeons of London, Edinburgh, and Dublin, that Vaccination was\r\nsalutary and generally effective, it is desirable that a Central\r\nInstitution be formed for the provision and distribution of Real\r\nVaccine Matter, and that its administration be committed to the\r\nRoyal Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons in London. The expense\r\nwould not be more than £2500 or £3000 per annum.\r\n\r\nMr. DAVIES GIDDY said he should not oppose the resolution, but it\r\nwould have been much better to have refrained from interference.\r\nThe people would neglect inoculation, and then smallpox would break\r\nout with tenfold severity.\r\n\r\nMr. FULLER observed that Smallpox had been annihilated in Calcutta\r\nby systematic and enforced Vaccination, and he believed the same\r\nresult was attainable in this country. He thought that even those\r\nwho hesitated to resort to general compulsion, would not object to\r\nthe Vaccination of all children in workhouses.\r\n\r\nSir T. TURTON would have preferred a committee of investigation.\r\nThere were already three Institutions in London for the express\r\npurpose of propagating cowpox, and the object Mr. Rose had in view\r\nwas more likely to be attained by private subscriptions and by\r\nassistance from Government than by a special Institution formed and\r\nendowed by the State.\r\n\r\nLord HENRY PETTY contended that as the evidence was now confessedly\r\nincomplete as to the infallible efficacy of Vaccination, it was\r\nhighly proper that investigation should be persevered in under the\r\neye of the public instead of by a number of small institutions\r\nwhich were not perhaps altogether exempt from the imputation of\r\nbeing guided by mercenary motives.\r\n\r\nSir FRANCIS BURDETT said Vaccination appeared before them with\r\na complexion widely differing from that originally assumed. A\r\nshort time ago they were assured it was an infallible preventive\r\nof Smallpox, and that its practice was so simple that any old\r\nwoman was equal to it. Now they were told that it was a very nice\r\noperation requiring great judgment and skill, the want of which\r\nwas held to account for the many failures which had occurred.\r\nThus there was neither that simplicity nor security which was\r\noriginally asserted. Considering these manifest discrepancies\r\nbetween promise and practice, it was, he thought, most unwise for\r\nthe House to intervene in order to help what appeared to be a\r\nfailing experiment. They ought to be cautious--they ought not to\r\nprop up what might prove to be pernicious error. Government in this\r\nfree country cannot compel people to submit to the prescriptions\r\nof physicians, or the operations of surgeons, or anything except\r\nthe laws; and it was doubtful whether science itself would be\r\nbenefitted if placed under Government direction. They were referred\r\nto the reports of the Medical Colleges, but as he read these\r\nreports he detected much hesitation and evasion, and anything but\r\nthe assurance displayed on behalf of Vaccination by several members\r\nof the House. Many instances of failure were admitted, and such\r\ninstances might safely be doubled. As for Spurious Cowpox he wished\r\nto know what it was. It was used to account for all mishaps, and\r\nit was, he suspected, a mere shift, shuffle, and get-off. [Sir\r\nFrancis need not have spoken thus dubiously, for the Report of the\r\nPhysicians admitted what he suspected.] He would much prefer a\r\ncommittee of investigation, and hoped the resolution would not be\r\npressed.\r\n\r\nMr. WILBERFORCE brought up the foreign argument. There might be\r\nfailures at home, but these could be satisfactorily accounted\r\nfor. It was for them to consider the magnificent successes of\r\nVaccination in other lands [_Omne ignotum pro magnifico est_],\r\nconcerning which there was no room for doubt. He saw no surer\r\nmethod of inspiring the public with confidence in Vaccination than\r\nby the establishment of the proposed Institution.\r\n\r\nMr. ROSE explained that he merely wished to bring the House to a\r\nresolution, leaving it to his Majesty [that was to say, himself for\r\nthe Government] to give it effect.\r\n\r\nMr. GEORGE CANNING, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,\r\ndeclared that though he considered the discovery of Vaccination\r\nto be of the greatest importance, yet he could not imagine any\r\ncircumstances whatever that would induce him to follow up the most\r\nfavourable report of its infallibility with any measure for its\r\ncompulsory infliction.\r\n\r\nThis declaration of Canning is well worth attention and\r\ncommemoration. It serves to mark the reverence for personal\r\nliberty, which was the fine distinction of the former order of\r\nEnglish statesmen, and separated, when little else did, the English\r\nfrom the Continental Tory. The noble tradition of this liberty\r\nmeets with scant favour in these times, and Canning’s avowal in\r\nthe new House of Commons would be heard as an anachronism. Nearly\r\nevery adventurer who has a prescription for the moral and physical\r\nwelfare of his fellow creatures hopes to have it enforced by\r\nlegislation; and since, under penalty of fine and imprisonment, our\r\nbabes are cut and poisoned to save them from smallpox, there is no\r\ninfraction of personal liberty, however outrageous, that can now be\r\npronounced impossible.\r\n\r\nWhen the House divided there were 60 for the motion and 5 against\r\nit--again a small House for so critical a matter.\r\n\r\nWith the permission to spend £3000 a year, the National Vaccine\r\nEstablishment was constituted, Jenner being consulted in its\r\norganisation. A Board was formed, consisting of the President and\r\nfour Censors of the Royal College of Physicians, and the Master\r\nand two senior Wardens of the College of Surgeons. The Board met\r\non 8th December, 1808, and proceeded to business. Jenner, as was\r\nhis fatality on important occasions, was absent, being detained at\r\nBerkeley by family affliction. He wrote to Moore--\r\n\r\n  I should be unworthy of the name of father were I to stir from\r\n  my children. Indeed, nothing would make me, not even a royal\r\n  mandate, unless accompanied by a troop of horse.\r\n\r\nJenner was elected Director, but not a member of the Board, and\r\nimmediately began to protest that he was disregarded and subjected\r\nto indignity. “The Board,” he said, “appointed me Director, but\r\nthey soon contrived to let me feel that I was to be a Director\r\n_directed_.” The arrangement he had made with Mr. Rose and Sir\r\nLucas Pepys, the President of the College of Physicians, was, he\r\nheld, altogether different--\r\n\r\n  It was stipulated between Mr. Rose, Sir Lucas, and myself, that\r\n  no person should take any part in the Vaccinating Department who\r\n  was not either nominated by me or submitted to my approbation.\r\n  On my reminding Sir Lucas of this, he replied, “You, Sir, are\r\n  to be whole and sole Director. We [meaning the Board] are to be\r\n  considered as nothing. What do _we_ know of Vaccination.”[139]\r\n\r\nSir Lucas of course was jeering, but Jenner’s head was so turned\r\nwith vanity and flattery that he could not distinguish mockery from\r\nsincerity. He had constructed for himself a fool’s paradise, out\r\nof which the Board pitched him unceremoniously. He recommended his\r\nbludgeon bearer, John Ring, for Chief Vaccinator and Inspector of\r\nStations, but the Board declined to have anything to do with him,\r\nand added insult to contempt; for in Jenner’s words, written in the\r\nthird person--\r\n\r\n  They appointed a gentleman in his place who was taken from an\r\n  Institution which had been personally hostile to Dr. Jenner on\r\n  all occasions.\r\n\r\nSubsequently he sent in a list of seven names for Sub-Vaccinators,\r\nof which the Board rejected five, which brought matters to a\r\ncrisis, and he resigned. In the memorandum, from which I have\r\nquoted, he wrote--\r\n\r\n  By the whole of these circumstances, Dr. Jenner felt himself\r\n  under the necessity of withdrawing from the establishment.\r\n  He could take upon himself no responsibility where he had\r\n  no power, not even a vote. He did not wish to control the\r\n  establishment; nothing was further from his thoughts. But he\r\n  expected that the practical part of its concerns would have been\r\n  under his direction, as the title of his office implied; and\r\n  he expected that those gentlemen whom, from a consciousness of\r\n  their pre-eminent ability, he had so strongly recommended to\r\n  conduct this practical part, would have been appointed. But as\r\n  his recommendations have been disregarded--as arrangements and\r\n  appointments have been made which are contrary to his judgment,\r\n  and as he is informed by the Board that it was intended for them\r\n  to use their own discretion, and that they alone are responsible\r\n  for the conduct of the establishment, Dr. Jenner declined\r\n  accepting the station of Director, to which they had nominated\r\n  him, since he found that he was to have nothing to do in the\r\n  establishment, and that his office was only a name.[140]\r\n\r\nTo those who did not know Jenner, or who accepted him at his own\r\nestimate, the treatment to which he was subjected might appear\r\nreprehensible; but the Board understood their man, and only cared\r\nto have the benefit of his name, for little else was worth having.\r\nWhat could be made of a character indolent and untrustworthy; who\r\ndisliked London and was off to Gloucestershire on any pretext;\r\nwhose sickly family had from him the supreme consideration of an\r\naffectionate mother! He wrote to Moore--\r\n\r\n  I agree with you that my not being a member of the British\r\n  Vaccine Establishment will astonish the world; and no one in it\r\n  can be more astonished than myself.\r\n\r\nHe was mistaken. The world, so far as it thought at all, considered\r\nhe was handsomely rewarded with his £30,000, and with so much\r\npublic money in his pocket might have looked for a better\r\ndisposition on his part. When his nominations were disregarded, he\r\ndeclined even to come to London, and thus excused his sulking at\r\nBerkeley--\r\n\r\n  I was quite in earnest at the time I informed you of my intention\r\n  to come to town, but while I was getting things in order there\r\n  came a piece of information from a Right Hon. Gentleman which\r\n  determined me to remain in my retirement. It was as follows--\r\n\r\n  _That the Institution was formed for the purpose of a full and\r\n  satisfactory investigation of the benefits or dangers of the\r\n  Vaccine Practice, and that this was the reason why Dr. Jenner\r\n  could not be admitted as one of the conductors of it, as the\r\n  public would not have the same confidence in their proceedings as\r\n  if the Board were left to their own judgment in doubtful cases._\r\n\r\n  This is the sum and substance of the communication--\r\n\r\n  What do we know of Vaccination?\r\n\r\n  We know nothing of Vaccination!\r\n\r\n  Alas! poor Vaccinia, how art thou degraded!\r\n\r\n  You intimated something of this sort to me some time since, and\r\n  now I get it from the fountain head. An institution founded on\r\n  the principle of inquiry seven or eight years ago, would have\r\n  been worthy of the British nation; but now, after the whole\r\n  world bears testimony to the safety and efficacy of the Vaccine\r\n  Practice, I do think it a most extraordinary proceeding. It\r\n  is one that must necessarily degrade me, and cannot exalt the\r\n  framers of it in the eyes of common-sense. I shall now stick\r\n  closely to _my own Institution_, which I have the pride and\r\n  vanity to think is paramount to all others, as its extent and\r\n  benefits are boundless. Of this I am the real and not the\r\n  nominal Director. I have conducted the whole concern for no\r\n  inconsiderable number of years, single-handed, and have spread\r\n  Vaccination round the globe. This convinces me that simplicity in\r\n  this, as in all effective machinery, is best.[141]\r\n\r\nIn the discussion in the House of Commons it was stated by\r\nhis friend, Lord Henry Petty, that one of the objects of the\r\nEstablishment would be investigation, and it was absurd for Jenner\r\nto pretend that the fact came upon him as a revelation; and,\r\nunless completely blinded by conceit, he must have recognised\r\nthat the general faith in Vaccination exhibited in 1801 had been\r\nmuch shaken by the experience of the succeeding seven years. But\r\nit is idle to argue the matter. When Jenner could say that he\r\nsingle-handed had conducted the whole concern for years and spread\r\nVaccination round the globe, he could assert anything. The letter\r\nis interesting chiefly as an exhibition of character.\r\n\r\nWe shall return to the National Vaccine Establishment and its\r\nmanagement--a curious story. Suffice it for the present to observe,\r\nthat its immediate effects were adverse to Vaccination. The annual\r\nendowment was consumed in salaries, and many ceased to subscribe\r\nto the Cowpox Societies since Vaccination was so well provided\r\nfor. The essential mischief consisted in the recognition of the\r\nevil practice by the State, whereby it has been perpetuated to the\r\ncommon injury to our own day.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGINAL VACCINE POCK INSTITUTION.\r\n\r\nThe national endowment of Vaccination afforded a convenient pretext\r\nfor closing this Institution, founded by Dr. Pearson and his\r\nfriends in 1799; but some said the true reason was involved in the\r\nfollowing resolutions--\r\n\r\n    VACCINE POCK INSTITUTION,\r\n    Broad Street, Golden Square.\r\n\r\n  GENERAL QUARTERLY COURT, Nov. 5, 1805.\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_--That according to the experience of the medical\r\n  establishment of this Institution, it appears that the\r\n  Inoculation for the Cowpock affords security against the Smallpox\r\n  equally with Variolous Inoculation, and that the new practice\r\n  possesses all the advantages already stated to the public.\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_--That, in order to give a further proof to the public,\r\n  and to afford an inducement for information adverse to the new\r\n  practice, the following proposal be made public, viz.:--That,\r\n  in future, every patient who shall be vaccinated at this\r\n  Institution, on discharge, shall receive a Certificate, stating\r\n  that such patient has gone through the Cowpock, and engaging that\r\n  if hereafter the said patient shall take the Smallpox, he or she\r\n  shall be entitled to the sum of Five Guineas, to be paid from the\r\n  funds of this Institution at the first General Court, after the\r\n  proofs have been given, according to the rules of the medical\r\n  establishment.\r\n\r\n    WILLIAM SANCHO, _Secretary_.\r\n\r\nThe offer attested the sincerity of the conductors of the\r\nInstitution, but so many patients, it is said, laid claim to Five\r\nGuineas that it was not without satisfaction that a reasonable\r\ncause was afforded for shutting up.\r\n\r\nDr. Pearson held that it was impossible to be re-vaccinated. He\r\nargued that since no one could have Smallpox twice, no one could\r\nhave the equivalent of Smallpox, namely Cowpox, twice. It was a\r\nlogical contention; but facts did not correspond to the logic.\r\nPearson also objected to the Variolous Test, or inoculation\r\nwith Smallpox after inoculation with Cowpox to prove that the\r\nconstitution was fortified against attack. He preferred Cowpox to\r\nSmallpox for the purpose, as milder and less liable to dangerous\r\nresults. He found that after Cowpox it was impossible to have\r\nCowpox--at least immediately. Hence he was confirmed in his opinion\r\nthat Cowpox after Cowpox was impossible; just as others argued on\r\nthe same grounds that Smallpox after Cowpox was impossible. Yet at\r\nthis day none doubt that Pearson was in error; for all believe in\r\nthe possibility of re-Vaccination, or Cowpox after Cowpox; likewise\r\nof Smallpox after Cowpox.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[139] Letter to JAMES MOORE, _16th January, 1809_.\r\n\r\n[140] Baron’s _Life of Jenner_, vol. ii. p. 124.\r\n\r\n[141] Letter to JAMES MOORE, _4th April, 1809_. Baron’s _Life of\r\nJenner_, vol. ii. p. 126.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nHORSEGREASE AS A SOURCE OF VACCINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to complete the account of Jenner’s awards and the\r\nadoption of Vaccination by Parliament, I have passed over several\r\nmatters of interest and significance, which I shall now proceed to\r\ndeal with, commencing with the tactics of our hero in relation to\r\nHorsegrease.\r\n\r\nIn his _Inquiry_, published in 1798, Jenner set forth Horsegrease\r\nas the origin of that form of Cowpox, which, when inoculated on\r\nthe human subject, ensured life-long security from Smallpox.\r\nMany attempts were consequently made to produce pox on the teats\r\nof cows by inoculating them with Horsegrease, but in vain; and\r\nthe possibility became discredited. Moreover, the notion of\r\ninoculation with Horsegrease, either immediately or through the\r\ncow, was disliked intensely. It was pronounced repulsive. Why virus\r\nfrom horses’ heels should be more repulsive than virus from cows’\r\nteats was not explained; but, as we know, there is no accounting\r\nfor tastes. Many who eat beef with relish would start with disgust\r\nfrom horse-flesh. A story is told of a Wesleyan who rebuked a\r\nsister for wearing feathers in her hat, and was sharply referred\r\nto the existence of flowers in her own. “Yes, sister dear,” was\r\nthe cogent reply, “but we must draw the line somewhere, and it is\r\ndrawn at feathers.” The line was drawn at Horsegrease, and the\r\norigin of Cowpox as asserted by Jenner and his country acquaintance\r\nwas conveniently denied. Jenner was not slow to perceive how the\r\nwind of opinion was blowing, and let Horsegrease drop. He said not\r\na word about it in his petition to Parliament in 1802, nor did he\r\nagain advance it as a reason for consideration.\r\n\r\nNow, why was this? Was it because he had ceased to believe that\r\nCowpox originated in Horsegrease? Not at all! Why, then, did he not\r\nvindicate his opinion and confront vulgar prejudice? Simply because\r\nhe had the wit to discern, that whilst he might get something out\r\nof the national purse for the Cowpox recipe, he could get nothing\r\nfor the Horsegrease one. As Dr. Pearson observed, “The very name\r\nof Horsegrease was like to have wrecked the whole concern”--an\r\nobservation that Dr. Mason Good confirms in saying, “The mere idea\r\nof using the matter of grease from the horse’s heel excited from\r\nthe first so deep and extensive a disgust that Cowpox Inoculation\r\nhad nearly fallen a sacrifice from the supposed union of the two\r\ndiseases.”\r\n\r\nIt is not to be supposed that I am censuring Jenner as a\r\ntradesman.[142] If any of us had two patents for sale, we should\r\nbe great fools if we declined to take £30,000 for one without the\r\nother, or suffered one to prejudice the other, or tried to inflict\r\nany doctrine about them upon the purchaser. It is for those who\r\ngo to market to adapt themselves to the market, and remember that\r\nsellers were made for buyers, and not buyers for sellers. Since\r\nthen the public were ready to pay for Cowpox, whilst they shuddered\r\nat Horsegrease, it was not for Jenner to force Horsegrease upon\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nSuch is mercantile logic; and on its own conditions it is\r\nirrefragable; but it is not the custom to deal with Jenner as a\r\ntradesman, but as a man of science, and to range him with great\r\ndiscoverers, inventors, and benefactors of mankind; and here it is\r\nthat I decidedly demur. What, I ask, did he discover? He did not\r\ndiscover that Cowpox prevented Smallpox: that was the dairy-maids’\r\nfaith. He did not discover that Horsegrease prevented Smallpox:\r\nthat was the farriers’ faith. He did not discover that Horsegrease\r\non milkers’ hands begot pox on cows’ teats: that was the farmers’\r\nbelief. He did not discover that inoculated virus could be conveyed\r\nfrom arm to arm: that was an existing practice. What then did he\r\ndiscover? He discovered nothing. He did no more than take the\r\nvulgar opinion of his neighbourhood to the London market. He made\r\na few perfunctory experiments by way of confirmation, advertised\r\nthem in a book, and by good or ill luck the notion was caught up,\r\nand worked to practical issues, chiefly by Pearson, who thereby\r\nincurred the full malignity of Jenner’s jealousy.\r\n\r\nThe distinction between a man of science and a tradesman is this,\r\nthat the mind of the one is set on the extraction of truth and\r\nthe other on the extraction of profit. The man of science does\r\nnot inquire what the public may be pleased to know and pay for,\r\nbut he ascertains and defines what is fact, and leaves the public\r\nto adjust themselves thereto as they may find convenient. If they\r\nrecognise the truth communicated, it is well for them; if they\r\ndislike or deny the truth, it is ill for them; but well or ill,\r\nthe man of science is the disinterested expositor of what he\r\nknows to be true; not unfrequently, when his revelation vitally\r\naffronts popular prejudice, realising the blessing of those who are\r\npersecuted for righteousness’ sake.\r\n\r\nWhat therefore I maintain concerning Jenner is, that the truth (as\r\nwe may presume he regarded it) he did not fully reveal; that what\r\nhe did reveal, he suffered to be derided and denied; that he was\r\ncontent to take credit for so much of it as was marketable; whilst\r\nhis private conviction about Horsegrease remained unaffected, not\r\nonly in theory, but in deliberate practice.\r\n\r\nIt is for me to establish these assertions.\r\n\r\nFirst, I say, he did not fully reveal what he knew. In 1789 Jenner\r\ninoculated his son, Edward, an infant of 18 months, not with\r\nCowpox, or with Horsegrease, but with Swinepox; and, according\r\nto the evidence of his own papers, the result was perfectly\r\nsatisfactory. The child was subsequently inoculated with Smallpox\r\non five or six different occasions, and always without effect.\r\nAccording to the well-known variolous test, he was proof against\r\nSmallpox. In short, there was nothing that Jenner ever adduced\r\nin favour of Cowpox that was not equally valid of Swinepox. And\r\nthis Swinepox experiment was made nearly ten years prior to his\r\nadvertisement of Cowpox and Horsegrease. Why, I ask, did he keep\r\nback the truth about Swinepox? When Cowpox was scarce, and every\r\ncow-house was explored for virus, why did he not recommend Swinepox\r\nas an alternative? Why, too, did he refrain from the obvious\r\ngeneralisation, that Cowpox, Horsegrease, Swinepox, and probably\r\nother sorts of pox, generated fevers, during the prevalence of\r\nwhich inoculation with Smallpox was not apt to take? The answer is\r\nplain, Because he had something to sell rather than something to\r\nteach.\r\n\r\nIn conformity with this conduct he suffered the origin of Cowpox\r\nin Horsegrease, and the specific virtue of grease to be derided\r\nand denied. “It was fortunate for Dr. Jenner, and the triumph of\r\nhis discovery,” wrote Dr. Mason Good, “that a minuter attention\r\nto the subject gave sufficient proof that there was no foundation\r\nfor his opinion that Cowpox originated in Horsegrease, nor that\r\nany connection existed between the diseases.”[143] Such was\r\nthe convenient medical verdict, which Jenner did not venture\r\nto disturb, though all the while persuaded of its error. There\r\nwere failures to inoculate cows with Horsegrease, but Thomas\r\nTanner, veterinary surgeon, of Rockhampton, Gloucestershire, “had\r\nthe merit,” says Dr. Baron, “of proving the truth of Jenner’s\r\nstatement.”[144] He succeeded in communicating the disease to\r\nthe cow from the heel of the horse, producing on the cow’s teat\r\na complete vaccine pustule. “From handling the cow’s teats,”\r\nsaid Tanner, “I became myself infected and had two pustules on\r\nmy hand, which brought on inflammation, and made me unwell for\r\nseveral days. The matter from the cow, and from my own hand, proved\r\nefficacious in infecting both human subjects and cattle.”[145]\r\nJenner distributed the virus from Tanner, and it operated precisely\r\nlike Cowpox. But the proof did not rest with Tanner: others\r\nrepeated his experiment with similar issues. Dr. Loy of Whitby\r\npublished in 1801 _Some Observations on the Origin of the Cowpox_,\r\nin which he confirmed Jenner’s country tales, and described how\r\n(dispensing with the cow) he managed to inoculate patients with\r\nHorsegrease, producing pustules identical with those from Cowpox,\r\nand subjecting the persons thus equinated to the variolous test\r\nwith complete impunity. Yet, with so much to fortify him, Jenner\r\nkept silent. He preferred to be adjudged mistaken rather than risk\r\nthe forfeit of public favour and pay. Nor might I blame him, had he\r\nfrankly reasserted the integrity of the Gloucestershire faith, and\r\nallowed that since the public were ready to accept Cowpox without\r\nHorsegrease, it was not for him to stand in the way of their\r\npreference by an obstinate defence of what was non-essential in\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nBut the case for Horsegrease was yet stronger than I have stated.\r\nDr. Sacco of Milan was sometimes described as “the prince of\r\nvaccinators” by reason of his enthusiasm, his professional\r\nattainments, and the facilities that were accorded to him in\r\nthe Cisalpine Republic of those days for universal vaccination.\r\nHe tried to generate pox on the cow with grease from the horse,\r\nbut failed, and in 1801 reported to Jenner his failure. In 1803,\r\nhowever, he cried, Eureka! A coachman presented himself at the\r\nMilan Hospital suffering from an eruption contracted in grooming\r\na horse with greasy heels. He was at once led off by Sacco to the\r\nFoundling Asylum, where nine children were inoculated from the\r\nvesicles on his hands. On three of the children the inoculation\r\ntook, producing vesicles which were pronounced to be the same as\r\nthose resulting from Cowpox. The virus was propagated from arm to\r\narm, and distributed in all directions. Dr. Sacco from thenceforth\r\navowed himself a Horsegreaser. “It is now admitted and settled,” he\r\nwrote to Jenner from Milan, 25th March, 1803, “that grease is the\r\ncause of vaccine, and we cannot too soon alter the designation to\r\nequine.”\r\n\r\nWas the designation changed to equine? It was not, nor was the\r\nattempt made. Those chiefly concerned in promoting vaccination in\r\nEngland would not hear of Horsegrease, and many were ready to swear\r\nthat in the matter of pox, the horse and the cow had no connection\r\nwhatever, and that Jenner had too hastily assumed the truth of a\r\nvulgar west country opinion.\r\n\r\nDr. De Carro of Vienna, who described himself as Jenner’s friend\r\nand first apostle, having effected the first vaccination on the\r\nContinent and transmitted the first charge of vaccine to India,\r\nwas also a Horsegreaser. Whilst Jenner was judiciously holding\r\nhis tongue about Horsegrease in England, he wrote to De Carro\r\ncongratulating him on his success in conveying Cowpox to the\r\nEast, and ascribing the failure of the English attempts to the\r\nabsurd prejudice against Horsegrease, which Dr. Loy had, however,\r\ncompletely annihilated. Here are his words under date, 28th March,\r\n1803--\r\n\r\n  I am confident that had not the opponents of my ideas of the\r\n  origin of the disease been so absurdly clamorous, particularly\r\n  the _par nobile fratrum_ [Pearson and Woodville], the Asiatics\r\n  would long since have enjoyed the blessings of Vaccination, and\r\n  many a victim been rescued from an untimely grave. The decisive\r\n  experiments of Dr. Loy have silenced the tongues of these\r\n  gentlemen for ever.[146]\r\n\r\nHow the clamorous opposition to Horsegrease had deprived Hindoos\r\nof the earlier blessing of vaccination, we are left to conjecture.\r\nPerhaps he meant that Horsegrease would have borne transit to India\r\nbetter than Cowpox, or that the Hindoos themselves might have\r\nresorted to horses with greasy heels.\r\n\r\nIn reply, 22nd April, 1803, De Carro wrote to Jenner commending his\r\nmoderation in maintaining silence toward his antagonists--little\r\napprehending the motives of that silence. Pearson’s conduct, he\r\nthought, bordered on insanity. “I am extremely glad,” he continued,\r\n“that you have treated it with the contempt it deserves, though I\r\nam happy to see that your friends have exposed his ridiculous and\r\nmalevolent designs.”\r\n\r\nDe Carro was intimate with Sacco of Milan, and from him received\r\nvirus derived from Horsegrease, which he used indiscriminately with\r\nCowpox, until in Vienna it was unknown who were vaccinated and who\r\nequinated.[147]\r\n\r\nDe Carro was also in correspondence with Dr. La Font, a\r\nFrench physician, established at Salonica, who was likewise a\r\nHorsegreaser. He discovered that the Macedonian farriers recognised\r\nthree sorts of grease in horses, called in general _javart_,\r\nand discriminated as _l’écrouelleux, le phlegmoneux, et la\r\nvariolique_.[148] With the variolous grease, La Font inoculated\r\ntwo boys, and from them other children, reproducing the experience\r\nof Loy of Whitby and Sacco of Milan. De Carro in communicating\r\nLa Font’s success to Jenner, 21st June, 1803, observed, “These\r\nparticulars, I hope, will silence all those who still doubt the\r\ntruth of your doctrine as to the connection of Grease, Cowpox, and\r\nSmallpox”--Jenner holding that Smallpox was a malignant variety of\r\nCowpox, whilst Cowpox came out of Horsegrease.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these confirmations and his boast that the\r\nopposition of Pearson and Woodville was silenced for ever, Jenner\r\nsuffered judgment to go against him. He recognised that it was\r\nexpedient that the connection between Horsegrease and Cowpox should\r\nbe denied. He had his bill to settle with the English public, and\r\nit was not for him to make difficulties. A curious evidence of\r\nhow thoroughly the unpopular truth was suppressed is furnished\r\nby Dr. Willan’s treatise _On Vaccine Inoculation_, published in\r\n1806. There is not a word or hint in it concerning Horsegrease.\r\nThe treatise was the work of a competent physician, who set forth\r\nwhat was known of vaccination (from the standpoint of belief) with\r\nfulness and clearness, accompanied with an appendix of letters and\r\nreports from Jenner himself, from Pearson and other experts in the\r\nnew practice--but as to Horsegrease, the silence was absolute. How\r\nthe disagreeable truth was so effectually covered up is more than I\r\ncan account for. It was not mentioned in the debates in Parliament,\r\nnor was it referred to in the reports of the Colleges of Physicians\r\nand Surgeons, nor did the opponents of vaccination use it with\r\nthe force that might have been expected. One explanation is,\r\nthat Jenner’s _Inquiry_ never entered into general circulation,\r\nthat no popular edition ever appeared, and that it was chiefly\r\nknown at second hand. The leading representatives of vaccination,\r\nmoreover, so boldly disowned Horsegrease and Jenner’s authority\r\nin ascribing Cowpox to its parentage, that there was little use\r\nin charging them with it; whilst all the while Jenner offered no\r\nopen resistance to those who contemned him for one mistake, but\r\nexhausted the language of adulation on his imputed merit. Thus we\r\nsuppose it came to pass that at the end of twenty years Dr. Mason\r\nGood, as the exponent of orthodox medical faith, felt justified in\r\nasserting that there was no foundation for the opinion that Cowpox\r\noriginated in Horsegrease, nor that any connection existed between\r\nthe diseases, and that it was fortunate for Jenner and the triumph\r\nof his discovery that the fact was so.\r\n\r\nJenner was silenced, but was he convinced? How could he be\r\nconvinced? Horsegrease as the origin of Cowpox might be voted\r\ndetestable and impossible, but there was the evidence of the\r\ncountry folk, confirmed by Tanner, Loy, Sacco, De Carro, and La\r\nFont; and though a weak man may be put down, or think it worth\r\nwhile to be accounted mistaken, yet, in the stillness of his mind,\r\nhe knows that facts are facts whatever may be said to the contrary.\r\nWhen, therefore, Jenner had filled his purse, obtaining all he\r\ncould expect from public favour, and was clear of London, and\r\nthe oppression of its savants, he reverted to his first opinion\r\nas true--true and untrue, true with a distinction, which I shall\r\npresently define. Writing to James Moore, Director of the National\r\nVaccine Establishment, from Berkeley, on 23rd July, 1813, he\r\nobserved--\r\n\r\n  You seem not perfectly satisfied that the origin of vaccine\r\n  is clearly made out. For my part, I should think that Loy’s\r\n  experiments were sufficient to establish it, to say nothing of\r\n  Sacco’s and others on the Continent. However, I have now fresh\r\n  evidence, partly foreign and partly domestic. The latter comes\r\n  from Mr. Melon, a surgeon of repute at Lichfield. He has sent me\r\n  some of his equine virus, which I have been using from arm-to-arm\r\n  for two months past, without observing the smallest deviation in\r\n  the progress and appearance of the pustules from those produced\r\n  by the vaccine.[149]\r\n\r\nAnd in a subsequent note of 1st August, he repeated--\r\n\r\n  DEAR MOORE,--I have been constantly equinating for some months,\r\n  and perceive not the smallest difference between the pustules\r\n  thus produced and the vaccine. Both are alike, because they come\r\n  from the same source.[150]\r\n\r\nTo Moore again he wrote from Cheltenham, 27th October, 1813--\r\n\r\n  I am sorry you have not succeeded in infecting a cow. I have told\r\n  you before _that the matter which flows from the fissures in the\r\n  horse’s heels will do nothing_. [Note the observation placed in\r\n  italics.] The virus is contained in vesicles on the edges and the\r\n  surrounding skin.\r\n\r\n  Did I ever inform you of the curious result of vaccinating\r\n  carters? From their youth these men have the care of horses\r\n  used for ploughing our corn lands; and great numbers have come\r\n  to me from the hills to be vaccinated, but the half have proved\r\n  insusceptible. On inquiry, many of them have recollected having\r\n  sores on their hands and fingers from dressing horses affected\r\n  with sore heels, and being so ill as to be disabled from work;\r\n  and on several of their hands, I have found the cicatrix as\r\n  perfect and characteristically marked as if it had arisen from my\r\n  own vaccination.[151]\r\n\r\nThen we have a memorandum of Jenner’s, dated 1st April, 1817,\r\nwherein he thus traces the course of the virus--\r\n\r\n  Rise and progress of the equine matter from the farm of Allen at\r\n  Wansell. From a horse to Allen; from Allen to two or three of his\r\n  milch cows; from the cows to James Cole, a young man who milked\r\n  at the farm; from James Cole to John Powell by inoculation from\r\n  a vesicle on the hand of Cole; and to Anne Powell, an infant;\r\n  from Powell to Samuel Rudder; from Rudder to Sophia Orpin, and\r\n  to Henry Martin; from H. Martin to Elizabeth Martin. All this\r\n  went on with perfect regularity for eight months, when the virus\r\n  became intermixed with other matter, so that no journal was\r\n  kept afterwards. Proof was obtained of the patients being duly\r\n  protected[152]--\r\n\r\nWhich was to say, that they were subsequently inoculated with\r\nSmallpox without effect. Among Jenner’s papers, there were other\r\nentries to the same purpose, thus--\r\n\r\n  _17th May, 1817._--Took matter from Jane King (equine direct)\r\n  for the National Vaccine Establishment. The pustules beautifully\r\n  correct.[153]\r\n\r\nThis equine virus from Jane King was extensively diffused. It was,\r\nwe see, sent to London; it was also sent to Edinburgh;[154] and\r\nDr. Baron says he had supplies of it for use in the Gloucester\r\nInfirmary. Baron relates that in the following year he was able\r\nto return the gift, having obtained virus from the hands of a boy\r\ninfected directly from the horse. Here is Jenner’s acknowledgment\r\nof the present, dated 25th April, 1818--\r\n\r\n  My Dear Baron,--Yesterday H. Shrapnell brought me the equine\r\n  virus and your drawing, which conveys so good an idea of the\r\n  disease, that no one who has seen it can doubt that the vesicles\r\n  contain the true and genuine life-preserving fluid. I have\r\n  inserted some of it into a child’s arm; but I shall be vexed if\r\n  some of your young men at the Infirmary have not done the same\r\n  with the fluid fresh from the boy’s hand.[155]\r\n\r\nIt is surely unnecessary to adduce further evidence of what was\r\nJenner’s mature faith and deliberate practice. Further, it is\r\nmanifest that to the end of his career he held that pox in the\r\ncow was not only derived from grease in the horse, but that it\r\nwas exclusively derived from the horse, and, that apart from the\r\nhorse, Cowpox would cease to exist. Owing to the multiplication of\r\nvaccination failures, it began to be conjectured that vaccine might\r\nbe worn out by transmission from arm-to-arm, and that a reversion\r\nto the cow might be expedient; and discussing the question in\r\na letter to Moore, dated 5th March, 1816, Jenner advanced the\r\nobjection--\r\n\r\n  If there were a real necessity for a renovation, I know not what\r\n  we should do; for the precautions of the farmers with respect to\r\n  their horses have driven the Cowpox from their herds.[156]\r\n\r\nWhy did not Moore rejoin, Where is the difficulty? Suppose pox\r\ndriven from the herds, what conceivable reason was there for\r\nanxiety when the cow had become a demonstrated superfluity?--when,\r\nin Jenner’s own words, “the true and genuine life-preserving\r\nfluid” might be drawn direct from horses’ heels? Except for the\r\nperpetuation of imposture, the cow in the case had ceased to have\r\nany value whatever. But, as so often happens with quacks, their\r\nminds become so saturated with their own humbug that there is\r\nnothing left of common-sense.\r\n\r\nHaving thus proved my assertions concerning Jenner, it may be\r\nreasonably asked, How was it that some got Cowpox by means of\r\nHorsegrease when others could not? for, it may be argued, that if\r\nCowpox issued straight and invariably from inoculated Horsegrease,\r\nnot even the most resolute prejudice against Horsegrease could have\r\npermanently kept back the truth.\r\n\r\nThe answer is, that Cowpox never came out of what is commonly known\r\nas Horsegrease. The statement made by Jenner in his _Inquiry_ of\r\n1798 that--\r\n\r\n  The limpid fluid which issues from the small cracks or fissures\r\n  in the inflamed and swollen horse’s heel--\r\n\r\ninfected cows and begot pox was a blunder, which he explicitly\r\nreversed fifteen years afterwards in his letter to Moore of 27th\r\nOctober, 1813, already cited--\r\n\r\n  I am sorry [he wrote] you have not succeeded in infecting a cow.\r\n  I have told you before that the matter which flows from the\r\n  fissures in the horse’s heel will do nothing. It is contained in\r\n  vesicles and the surrounding skin.[157]\r\n\r\nJenner, we have always to remember, was a slovenly investigator,\r\nnot apt to take pains, but apt to eke out observation with\r\ninvention. His friend, “honest Jack Baron of Gloucester,” who\r\nhimself inoculated with horse virus unmodified by the cow, actually\r\nwrote Jenner’s life in two volumes, and not until the work was\r\nready for the binder did he discover that he was in error in\r\ncommon with his master in ascribing Cowpox to Horsegrease! Such\r\nwas the intellectual muddle in which these prophets of vaccination\r\noperated! In a note stuck at the end of the second volume, we have\r\nthe following amazing confession, made, remember, in 1838, fifteen\r\nyears after the chief conjurer’s death--\r\n\r\n  I take this opportunity of expressing my regret that I have\r\n  employed the word _Grease_ in alluding to the disease in the\r\n  horse. _Variolæ Equinæ_ is the proper designation. It has no\r\n  necessary connection with the _Grease_, though the disorders\r\n  frequently co-exist. This circumstance at first misled Dr.\r\n  Jenner, and it has caused much misapprehension and confusion.[158]\r\n\r\nHere we have the secret and desired explanation. It was out of\r\nHorsepox, and not out of Horsegrease, that Cowpox was derived,\r\nand in confounding grease with pox, Jenner mystified himself\r\nand others, and obscured the whole doctrine of vaccination.\r\nThe Macedonian farriers who in 1803 informed La Font that they\r\nrecognised three sorts of grease, and one of them variolous, were\r\nmore accurate observers than the Gloucestershire farriers and\r\nfarmers whose opinion Jenner lazily retailed. Whether he had any\r\nclear apprehension of his own blunder is not apparent. We have\r\nseen how long it took his biographer, Baron, to find it out. This\r\nis certain, that he made no public attempt to set right what he\r\nhad so egregiously set wrong, nor to withdraw the statement in\r\nhis _Inquiry_ that Horsegrease only acquired its efficacy against\r\nSmallpox after inoculation on the cow.\r\n\r\nLastly, we may inquire what is the present state of opinion as to\r\nHorsegrease and Cowpox? When difficult questions are asked, we\r\nusually turn to our cyclopædias, and taking down Hooper’s _Lexicon\r\nMedicum_, 8th ed. 1848, Art. Cowpox, we read--\r\n\r\n  It is now ascertained that the horse and the cow each furnish,\r\n  independently of the other, a virus capable of communicating\r\n  genuine Cowpox to the human subject.\r\n\r\nGenuine Cowpox communicated by a horse is surely a bull of the\r\nfirst magnitude! The _Encyclopædia Britannica_, 8th ed. 1860, Art.\r\nVaccination, illuminates us thus--\r\n\r\n  It is now to be regarded as an established fact, that Horsegrease\r\n  and Cowpox are the same complaint, modified by the constitution\r\n  of the animals in which they occur.\r\n\r\nAn established fact, indeed!--established in quicksand!\r\n\r\nSome say the Gloucestershire farmers and Jenner were correct in\r\nattributing Cowpox to Horsegrease, and that they can only he\r\ncharged with mistake in nomenclature. When they said Horsegrease,\r\nthey meant Horsepox, not discriminating between maladies that\r\nsometimes occurred together. No one now believes that the affection\r\nrecognised by veterinarians as “grease” ever originated Cowpox. The\r\nsame rural authorities, including Jenner, held that where there was\r\nno Horsepox, there could be no Cowpox; but, so far as I can make\r\nout, that conclusion is surrendered. Pox on the horse may generate\r\npox on the cow, but the cow may have pox without the horse.\r\n\r\n  In this respect only was Jenner in error [says Mr. George\r\n  Fleming, Army Veterinary Inspector]. The two diseases are\r\n  perfectly independent of each other. Cowpox appears where there\r\n  are no horses, or possible contact with horses; and may affect a\r\n  number of cows in a dairy while the horses are entirely free from\r\n  Horsepox.[159]\r\n\r\nAt this point comes the tug of war. If cows have pox, how do they\r\ncontract the malady? Speaking at the London Conference on Animal\r\nVaccination in December, 1879, Professor J. B. Simonds, Principal\r\nof the Royal Veterinary College, said--\r\n\r\n  My contention is, that the existence of Cowpox has to be proved.\r\n  Jenner’s account of the disease was an illusion. In my experience\r\n  among animals for forty years, I have never seen a case of\r\n  Cowpox, and I do not believe that any form of variola belongs to\r\n  the bovine race. Sheep are afflicted with pox, but not cattle. We\r\n  hear of Cowpox, but who ever heard of Bullpox? And is it credible\r\n  that a disease should be confined to cows and never attack bulls\r\n  and steers? Let any one point out an affection of females that\r\n  does not extend to the males of the same species.\r\n\r\nProfessor Simonds and others believe that Cowpox as described by\r\nJenner was a parasitic affection of Smallpox, probably communicated\r\nby milkers; and that Ceely, Badcock, and others did intentionally,\r\nwhat milkers had done inadvertently, when they inoculated cattle\r\nwith Smallpox in order to create virus for vaccination. On the\r\nother hand, those who assert the independent existence of Cowpox,\r\nhold no terms with this heresy. As Dr. Cameron says, “We can no\r\nmore make Smallpox into Cowpox than by stunting an oak-tree we can\r\nmake it a gooseberry bush.” Fortunately I have no call to pronounce\r\njudgment on the controversy. The more it rages, the better I\r\nlike it, and if the combatants disposed of each other as did the\r\nKilkenny cats, I might not be very sorry.\r\n\r\nA last word as to Horsepox. There seems to be little doubt that\r\nwhen inoculated on man it gives rise to vesicles indistinguishable\r\nfrom those raised by Cowpox. In 1863 Professor Bouley of Alfort\r\nproduced pox on a cow by inoculating it with pox from a horse,\r\nand children were successfully vaccinated with the virus. In the\r\nTransactions of the Clinical Society, Vol. X., Mr. John Langton,\r\ndescribes the case of a groom who came to St. Bartholomew’s\r\nHospital, 20th March, 1877, with an eruption caught from a horse\r\nexactly like that induced by vaccination; and there could be no\r\nquestion, says Mr. Langton, that the disease was the same as that\r\ndescribed by Jenner as grease.\r\n\r\nThere is much virus in currency as vaccine that is equine, and many\r\nof us are equinated who suppose ourselves vaccinated; and it might\r\nbe argued that we have been saved from Smallpox by reason of our\r\nequination. Why with all the notorious failures of vaccination, and\r\nof re-vaccination, some of the more audacious medical quacks do not\r\nrecommend Horsepox as an infallible alternative, is not easy to\r\nunderstand. It would be a Napoleonic stroke; nor is it improbable\r\nthat before vaccination is surrendered the attempt will be made.\r\nHow easily it might be asserted that vaccination is a failure in\r\nso far as it has lost the original virtue of equination, that the\r\nremedy is to dismiss the cow and revert to the horse, from whose\r\npoxy heels, as the immortal Jenner observed, there issues “the true\r\nand genuine life-preserving fluid.” The oracle might be worked\r\nthus--\r\n\r\n“Let us hear no more of pure lymph from the calf, too often, alas!\r\nan illusion. Sure and certain salvation from Smallpox can only\r\nbe guaranteed to those inoculated with pure pox from the horse.\r\nCome then to the horse, the horse with pox! Come quickly! Come\r\nyourselves! Come with your wives! Come with your children! Come and\r\nbe saved by Horsepox from the loathsome pestilence that decimates\r\nthe human race and brings myriads to untimely graves!”\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[142] As tradesman, however, Jenner was not honest. He took to\r\nmarket what was not his to sell. The introduction of Cowpox for\r\ninoculation (stigmatised in _The Inquiry_ as spurious, not being\r\nderived from Horsegrease) was effected by Pearson, and Jenner’s\r\nclaim to it was an act of piracy.\r\n\r\n[143] _Study of Medicine_, vol. iii. p. 59.\r\n\r\n[144] _Life of Jenner_, vol. i. p. 248.\r\n\r\n[145] _Treatise on the Cowpox._ By John Ring.

The statement is widely at variance with facts.\r\nVaccination was accepted with instant acclamation by the medical\r\nprofession, the royal family, and the public as an infallible\r\nand harmless preventive of smallpox; and the subsequent course\r\nof experience was to disprove alike its harmlessness and\r\ninfallibility. That in some cases vaccination was encountered with\r\nabsurdity and violence lay in the nature of things, even as it\r\nwas advocated with absurdity, violence and prevarication. It is\r\nalways easy to raise a laugh by the exhibition of the extravagance\r\nof either side in a hot dispute, but to what purpose? It would\r\nhave been no cause for surprise if some had been moved to scorn\r\nby the facile credulity with which Jenner’s magical prescription\r\nwas so rashly accepted, but the world to which he appealed had no\r\nscientific acquaintance with the laws of health, and it was in\r\nnowise marvellous that, convinced of the prophylaxy of inoculated\r\nsmallpox, they should have been overcome by the plausibility of\r\ninoculated cowpox. Yet were not all overcome, nor were all who\r\nresisted the popular craze furious. There was John Birch, for\r\nexample, surgeon to St. Thomas’s Hospital, who with calmness and\r\ncogency steadily protested against the introduction of “the new\r\ndisease styled cowpox;” and we may read his letters and pamphlets\r\nand fail to note a fiery epithet or unkindly imputation. People who\r\ntalk as if all who opposed Jenner were steeped in ignorance and\r\nperversity can know nothing of John Birch.\r\n\r\nAlthough satisfied with variolous inoculation, he had no objection\r\nto vaccination in itself. He thought it fair that experiments with\r\ncowpox should be tried, and the verdict of experience submitted\r\nto; but he complained that experience was anticipated and success\r\nproclaimed ere it was possible for the truth to be known, whilst\r\nevery objector was overwhelmed with abuse. As an illustration\r\nof the unwarrantable persuasion that prevailed in favour of the\r\nnew practice before there was time to justify it, Birch mentions\r\nthat at the anniversary dinner at Guy’s Hospital in 1802, he was\r\nsurprised to find the usual business set aside to secure signatures\r\nto Jenner’s petition for a vote of money from Parliament, and that\r\nafter dinner toasts, songs, and compliments in honour of Vaccinia\r\nwere the order of the day. Booksellers, he relates, declined to\r\npublish anything against vaccination, and editors of newspapers and\r\nmagazines would not suffer a word to appear to its disparagement.\r\nEven the Post Office carried the cowpox and correspondence of\r\nthe Royal Jennerian Society gratis until the collapse of the\r\nconcern in 1806. Those who resorted to doctors and hospitals for\r\ninoculation with smallpox got cowpox instead in spite of assertions\r\nto the contrary. Church vied with chapel in recommending the new\r\npractice. The Archbishop of Canterbury was called upon to issue\r\na letter directing the clergy to recommend vaccination from the\r\npulpit, but, with the wariness of office, sent his chaplain to\r\nBirch to hear the other side, and the chaplain retired with the\r\njudicious observation, “His Grace must not commit the Church.” Many\r\nclergymen, however, not only preached vaccination, but practised it\r\nwith restless assiduity. Erasmus Darwin was not without hope that\r\nbaptism and vaccination might be associated. He wrote to Jenner\r\nfrom Derby, 24th February, 1802--\r\n\r\n  As by the testimony of innumerable instances, the Vaccine Disease\r\n  is so favourable to young children, in a little time it may occur\r\n  that the christening and vaccination of children may always be\r\n  performed on the same day.\r\n\r\n_The Vaccine Disease so favourable to young children!_ The\r\nassertion affords a vivid glimpse of the prevalent enchantment.\r\n“The idea of connecting religious services with vaccination,” says\r\nBaron, “had occurred to several individuals in this country as well\r\nas on the Continent.”[160]\r\n\r\n  I viewed with indignant scorn [wrote Birch], the ungenerous\r\n  artifice adopted by the Jennerian Society of sticking up in\r\n  every Station House, in the Vestries of fanatical Chapels, and\r\n  in Sunday Schools, that false _Comparative View of the effects\r\n  of Smallpox and Cowpox_ representing to the gaping multitude\r\n  a frightful picture of Inoculation with the supposed misery\r\n  attendant on it; and exhibiting representations equally false and\r\n  exaggerated of the blessings of Vaccination.\r\n\r\nThe women were not behind the clergy in diffusing vaccine\r\nsalvation. They were Jenner’s most devoted allies. He took pains\r\nto teach ladies to operate with “a light hand” so as not to draw\r\nblood, and boasted that one of his pupils had ten thousand patients\r\nto her credit, rescued from the terror and peril of smallpox!\r\n\r\nAs Birch observed, it was not a question of medicine or of surgery\r\nthat he and others had to deal with, but an outburst of enthusiasm\r\nin which the methods and arguments of science were swept heedlessly\r\naway. Any testimony to the credit of vaccination was accepted\r\nwith alacrity, whilst the facts to its discredit were denied or\r\nexplained away. This recklessness of procedure was most painfully\r\nmanifest in the conduct of the Committee of the House of Commons\r\nwhich sat on Jenner’s first petition for money in 1802--\r\n\r\n  The number of witnesses in support of the application [wrote\r\n  Birch] was 40, but out of the forty 28 spoke from mere hearsay,\r\n  and not from knowledge acquired in practice; while the three who\r\n  spoke against it were heard impatiently, though they corroborated\r\n  their evidence with proofs.\r\n\r\nBirch wished to know what cowpox was. Jenner had said it was\r\nderived from horsegrease, but “that origin is proved to be\r\nerroneous, and is now given up, even by his best friends. On all\r\nhands it is admitted,” Birch continued, “that it is not a disease\r\nof the cow, but communicated to the cow by the milker. No cow that\r\nis allowed to suckle her own calf ever has the complaint.” What,\r\nthen, is the disease in the milker? asked Birch. Is it smallpox?\r\nIs it _lues venerea_? Is it itch? A man came to St. Thomas’s\r\nHospital from an adjacent dairy with a hand and arm covered with\r\nulcerations. He said several of the milkers and the cows’ teats\r\nwere affected in the same way, and he was told they had got cowpox.\r\nBirch called one of his country pupils and asked him what was wrong\r\nwith the man. “It is itch--rank itch,” was his reply. A box of\r\nJackson’s ointment for the itch was given to him, and at the end\r\nof a week he reappeared at the Hospital cured. If cowpox be itch,\r\nargued Birch--\r\n\r\n  Then if a patient be inoculated with the disorder, though it\r\n  may suspend the capacity for Smallpox for a season in the\r\n  constitution, it will ultimately prove no security--\r\n\r\nWhich was to say, that it was not probable that smallpox and itch\r\ncould occur together, and that a person inoculated with itch would\r\npass through the variolous test successfully. In this connection we\r\nmay recall the fact that Jenner found it impossible to vaccinate a\r\nregiment at Colchester, the men with their women and children all\r\nbeing afflicted with itch.\r\n\r\nStill farther to complicate the mystery of cowpox, Jenner began\r\nto describe it as genuine and spurious, but which was the one and\r\nwhich was the other he left in bewildering uncertainty. Said Birch--\r\n\r\n  Though Dr. Jenner could not tell us what Cowpox was, he soon came\r\n  forward to inform us that it was of two sorts--the one genuine\r\n  and harmless, the other spurious and hurtful.\r\n\r\n  _Spurious_ Cowpox is a term I do not admit of. I know of no such\r\n  thing as _spurious_ Smallpox, _spurious_ Measles, _spurious_ Lues\r\n  Venerea, _spurious_ Scrofula.\r\n\r\nBirch’s objection to spurious cowpox was forcible, but what in\r\nthe innocence of his heart he took for a blunder was proved out\r\nof Jenner’s own mouth to be a deliberate dodge in 1807. Pressed\r\nby the Committee of the College of Physicians to explain what he\r\nmeant by Spurious Cowpox, he had to own that he knew nothing of\r\nsuch a malady, and that he had only meant to describe irregular\r\neffects of cowpox on the arms of the vaccinated! In other words,\r\nwhen vaccination turned out badly, he had found it convenient to\r\nascribe the disaster to spurious vaccine! The policy revealed in\r\nthis shameless avowal was cynically justified by Dr. Maunsell, who,\r\nin a well known volume, wrote--\r\n\r\n  The term _imperfect_ or _Spurious_ Vaccination is frequently to\r\n  be met with in books, and has been the cause of no small degree\r\n  of confusion in practice, although, at the same time, _it has\r\n  frequently afforded the practitioner an excellent asylum against\r\n  the storms now and then arising out of failures in the protective\r\n  power of the vaccine disease_.[161]\r\n\r\nFrom out the muddle as to the origin of cowpox and its genuine and\r\nspurious varieties, Birch demanded, What had Jenner discovered? It\r\nis not that cowpox prevents smallpox; for that has been asserted by\r\ndairy-folk for generations, and has been disregarded by physicians\r\nbecause proved to be untrue. What then is it? Let him define his\r\ndiscovery that we may know how to respect it. Let him explain why\r\nit is forbidden to inoculate direct from the cow. Is genuine cowpox\r\ninvisible and to be taken on trust? Or is the disease so virulent\r\non its first communication that it has to be meliorated in the body\r\nof some victim ere it is fit for public use? Birch asked these\r\nquestions as we continue to ask What is cowpox? Is it a disease\r\nof the cow? Or is it communicated to the cow by man or by horse?\r\nHowever definite the answers, the contradictions are equally\r\ndefinite, and the authorities equally trustworthy.\r\n\r\nPractical men answered for Jenner, as they presume to answer at\r\nthis day, “Whatever may be the origin of cowpox, we know that\r\nvaccination is harmless, and that it prevents smallpox; and more we\r\nneither demand nor care to inquire.” The credulity and conceit of\r\nsuch practical men is that stupidity against which, says Goethe,\r\neven the gods are powerless. It was practical men who “on the mere\r\nshow of reason” accepted vaccination before it could be tested, and\r\non most superficial evidence, said Birch--\r\n\r\n  Recommended Dr. Jenner to the munificence of Parliament for a\r\n  discovery in practice which was never to prove fatal; which was\r\n  to excite no new humours or disorders in the constitution; which\r\n  was to be, not only a perfect security against Smallpox, but\r\n  would, if universally adopted, prevent its recurrence for ever.\r\n\r\nThe harmlessness of the practice was soon belied--\r\n\r\n  It gave rise [wrote Birch] to new and painful disorders. It was\r\n  sometimes followed by itchy eruptions; sometimes by singular\r\n  ulcerations; and sometimes by glandular swellings of a nature\r\n  wholly distinct from scrofula, or any other known glandular\r\n  disease. Eruptions of the skin are most frequent, and may be\r\n  heard of in every parish of London; and whether Vaccination shall\r\n  be called the Cow Evil, or the Jennerian Evil, posterity will\r\n  have to determine.\r\n\r\nThe non-fatality of the practice was also speedily confuted. The\r\ndisorders it excited caused numerous deaths--from erysipelas\r\nespecially. It was then said, as it continues to be said to\r\nthis day, “Yes, but it was not vaccination, but erysipelas the\r\npatient died of”--a form of words that seems to satisfy many minds\r\naccounted rational. Birch mentioned three or four cases of death\r\nresulting from vaccination, and adds--\r\n\r\n  These cases were as favourably palliated and ingeniously excused\r\n  as they could be; but it is admitted _that each patient was\r\n  punctured by a lancet infected with what is called Cowpox; each\r\n  arm so punctured became inflamed and ulcerated, and each patient\r\n  died_.\r\n\r\nThe Variolous Test, used so unscrupulously to win converts to\r\nvaccination, was proved by the Inoculators to be untrustworthy.\r\nThey had no difficulty in variolating the vaccinated. When it was\r\ndiscovered that vaccination was no guard against smallpox, many\r\nof the vaccinated resorted to inoculation with smallpox, and they\r\n“took” as readily as did their unvaccinated acquaintance. Five in\r\none family, the Hignells of Cheltenham, vaccinated by Jenner were\r\nvariolated by Mr. Freeman, and smallpox resulted in the ordinary\r\ncourse. Nothing indeed became plainer than that the vaunted\r\nVariolous Test was a mere conjuring trick, and the more judicious\r\nvaccinators ceased to refer to it.\r\n\r\nThe promise that the vaccinated would remain for ever secure from\r\nsmallpox Birch had no difficulty with. Londoners vaccinated by the\r\nmost approved operators caught smallpox, and died precisely as\r\ndid the unvaccinated. “Every post,” said Birch in 1804, “brings\r\nme accounts of the failures of vaccination.” As the failures\r\nmultiplied, so did the excuses. There was the prime excuse of\r\ngenuine and spurious cowpox. If vaccination failed, it could only\r\nbe through the inadvertent use of spurious vaccine. Jenner had\r\ntaught that one puncture was all-sufficient for protection, but\r\nas one was not found effective, it was asserted that two or three\r\nwere requisite for absolute safety. Many, it was alleged, had been\r\nimperfectly operated upon, and the practice of the women and clergy\r\nand other busybodies was thrown into discredit, although at the\r\noutset their services and testimonies had been blazoned abroad as\r\nindisputable; but Birch made this conclusive answer--\r\n\r\n  It cannot be meant to class Mr. Wachsel, Apothecary to the\r\n  Smallpox Hospital, or Mr. Bing, the Accoucheur, among ignorant\r\n  and equivocal practitioners; and yet from the patients vaccinated\r\n  by these two persons I could bring instance of more failures,\r\n  more deaths, and more diseases than have occurred in the practice\r\n  of any other two persons who have come within my knowledge.\r\n\r\nMany, moreover, who had been vaccinated by Jenner fell victims to\r\nthe disease, and he was so pestered with awkward questions, says\r\nBirch, “that to avoid the perplexing appeals that were made to him\r\ndaily, and the messages that were perpetually sent requiring him\r\nto visit untoward cases, he retired from London.” Subsequently he\r\nhad to forsake Cheltenham for the same reason. The convictions of\r\nquackery were too numerous for his endurance.\r\n\r\nHaving proved that vaccination did not prevent smallpox, whilst\r\nit was a frequent cause of illness and death, Birch held up to\r\nderision the fine promises wherewith its advocates had beguiled the\r\npeople--\r\n\r\n  Were an architect to undertake to build an edifice which should\r\n  be firm in its foundation; all its rooms wind and water tight;\r\n  and such as might be inhabited with perfect security; if, before\r\n  the edifice were well finished, the foundations were discovered\r\n  to be rotten; and if in less than seven years, several apartments\r\n  had fallen in and killed those who occupied them, while in a\r\n  great number of rooms, the wind or rain was continually beating\r\n  in, could I be blamed for declaring that the architect had\r\n  broken his contract, and that the edifice ought no longer to be\r\n  inhabited? Certainly not. Why then am I to be told that I am\r\n  acting perversely when I remonstrate against the practice of\r\n  Cowpox? for such an edifice as I have described, so rotten in its\r\n  foundations, so ill built, so ruinous, is Vaccination.\r\n\r\nThose who take success as the test of truth may say that Birch\r\nwas unsuccessful in his contention; but he was not unsuccessful.\r\nVaccination in London was discredited, and the imposture abated,\r\nas the report of the College of Surgeons in 1807 attests. Where\r\nretained, it was not so much as a preventive as a mitigator of\r\nsmallpox, its advocates being content to occupy the safe position\r\nthat it made milder a disease the severity of which was unknown.\r\n\r\nBirch died in 1815. His sister reprinted his papers against\r\nvaccination (from which have come my citations[162]), and erected\r\na monument to his memory in St. Margaret’s, Rood Lane, Fenchurch\r\nStreet, the inscription on which is noteworthy.\r\n\r\n    SACRED\r\n    To the Memory of\r\n    JOHN BIRCH, _Esquire_,\r\n    Many years an eminent Surgeon of this Metropolis;\r\n    who died on the 3rd February, 1815,\r\n    Aged 69 Years,\r\n    and whose earthly remains lie deposited under the Pulpit and Desk.\r\n\r\n    _In his professional Character,\r\n    As humane as he was skilful,\r\n    He permitted not the daily sight of wounds and sores,\r\n    Afflictions and wretchedness of every kind,\r\n    To blunt the edge of his natural feelings,\r\n    For the sufferings of his Fellow creatures:\r\n    But, contemning a too hasty reliance on vaunted Theories,\r\n    Sparing of the Knife--abhorring unnecessary Torture--\r\n    A foe to wanton, cruel, or dangerous experiment,\r\n    Averse from rash operation, and the destruction of parts,\r\n    Redeemable by patient and judicious care--\r\n    He erected for himself a high and distinguished reputation,\r\n    On the solid, and only secure Basis of\r\n    ENLIGHTENED EXPERIENCE:\r\n    Stimulated throughout Life by a wise and Christian-like\r\n    Ambition, to_ cure, _not_ maim--preserve, _and not destroy_.\r\n\r\n    _Mankind is indebted to him\r\n    For a more intimate acquaintance with the powers\r\n    Of MEDICAL ELECTRICITY;\r\n    By his own ingenious and improved application of which\r\n    He performed many remarkable and almost unhoped-for cures.\r\n    But the Practice of COW-POXING,\r\n    Which first became general in his Day,\r\n    Undaunted by the overwhelming influence of\r\n    Power and Prejudice, and the voice of Nations,\r\n    He uniformly, and until Death, perseveringly opposed;\r\n    Conscientiously believing it to be a_ Public Infatuation,\r\n    _Fraught with peril of the most mischievous consequences to Mankind.\r\n    Whether right or wrong, Time will most surely determine:--\r\n    MAN’S MERE OPINIONS MUST EVER BE LIABLE TO ERROR;\r\n    BUT BY THE MOTIVES THAT SWAY HIS HEART\r\n    SHALL HE ALONE BE JUDGED._\r\n\r\n    To perpetuate the remembrance of Qualities so excellent,\r\n    PENELOPE BIRCH,\r\n    His affectionate and only surviving Sister,\r\n    Hath raised this Monument:\r\n    Not out of a worldly and vain-glorious\r\n    _Pride of Affinity_;\r\n    But in order to hand down an Example worthy of Imitation\r\n    To succeeding Ages.\r\n\r\nJenner recognised Birch as a dangerous antagonist, and behaved\r\ntoward him with his usual meanness. Writing from Berkeley, 11th\r\nOctober, 1812, to Moore in London, where smallpox was prevalent, he\r\nobserved--\r\n\r\n  I have not heard lately whether the fury of the Smallpox\r\n  is abated in town. I trust it is. Had I power to exercise\r\n  vaccination as I liked, in one fortnight this dismal work\r\n  of death should entirely cease. What a sad wicked fellow is\r\n  that Birch!

He did\r\nnot turn against vaccination, but suggested that its prophylaxy\r\nmight neither be so certain nor so enduring as at first asserted.\r\nVaccination, he pointed out, had been carried into practice on a\r\nwave of enthusiasm, and it was not unreasonable to expect that\r\non closer acquaintance some of the claims made for it should be\r\nsubject to modification. Indeed so much was already admitted; for\r\nfailures had led to the discrimination of spurious from genuine\r\ncowpox, and to the issue of new instructions as to the period of\r\ntaking vaccine, “on which point, it was now said, depended the\r\nwhole success of the operation.” Thus what was originally set\r\nforth as an operation for which any novice was competent, had\r\ndeveloped into one of considerable delicacy with serious liability\r\nto miscarriage. Goldson, therefore, had fair reason to believe\r\nthat his own observations and suggestions would meet with candid\r\nconsideration, and, if verified, serve for general guidance in the\r\npractice of vaccination.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to recite Goldson’s cases. Interesting at the\r\ntime, they are now commonplace. He found that inoculation with\r\nsmallpox was possible at an interval after vaccination, and that\r\ninfection with smallpox was equally possible under the like\r\ncircumstances. One case is noteworthy for its connection with\r\nJenner. A seaman, named Clarke, was successfully vaccinated on 4th\r\nNovember, 1800, and, returning from a voyage to the West Indies was\r\nput to the variolous test on 24th March, 1802, when he sickened\r\nwith smallpox and was sent to Haslar. To prove that his malady was\r\nreally smallpox, several persons were variolated from him. The\r\nCommittee of the House of Commons was sitting on Jenner’s first\r\nclaim for public money, and Goldson wrote to Jenner to come to\r\nHaslar and see Clarke for himself; but Jenner was too astute to\r\ncumber himself with difficulties at a time when so much cash was in\r\nquestion. The case was mentioned to the Committee, but was treated\r\nas of no moment in presence of what they were pleased to regard as\r\noverwhelming evidence as to the perpetual virtue of vaccination.\r\n\r\nGoldson’s was a modest pamphlet--conjectural rather than\r\ndemonstrative. He ventured to think it was possible that the\r\nefficacy of vaccine might be weakened by transmission from arm to\r\narm, and that security might be restored by reversion to the cow--\r\n\r\n  The casual Cowpox is produced by virus immediately from the\r\n  animal; while the inoculated disease is the effect of _new\r\n  matter_ generated by the action of the other on the human\r\n  subject. Whether that _new matter_ be possessed of the power to\r\n  produce the same _permanent_ properties as the _parent_ virus,\r\n  time alone can decide.\r\n\r\nHe likewise suggested that horsegrease might be inoculated on\r\nthe nipple of the milch mare, and the virus used for equination.\r\nThese and other points were advanced with a philosophic grace\r\nthat ought to have commanded respect; but, on the contrary, his\r\npamphlet was received with a howl of fury, and its author denounced\r\nas an ill-conditioned fellow--ignorant, prejudiced, pig-headed.\r\nIt was safer to be pronounced anti-vaccinist than a vaccinator\r\nand harbour doubt as to any article of the Jennerian faith. Ring\r\nplied his bludgeon over the heretic, and Jenner wrote of him\r\nwith malicious insolence--“All his reasoning is erroneous;” “his\r\narrogance is increased by attention;” “he obstinately holds a veil\r\nbefore his eyes, and will not behold the vaccine light;” “one\r\nmight as well contend with a blind man on the nature of a prism;”\r\nand so on. Goldson’s offence was that he laid his finger on some\r\nof the weaker points of vaccination; that his sight was too keen,\r\nand his reasoning too cogent. At this day the questions between\r\nhim and Jenner are decided by vaccinators themselves in Goldson’s\r\nfavour.[165]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most able attack on the practice of vaccination was\r\ndelivered by Thomas Brown, surgeon, Musselburgh; and it is much to\r\nbe regretted that his book, published in Edinburgh in 1809,[166]\r\nis so little known at this day. Brown had accepted vaccination,\r\ncarried away, he admitted, by the common enthusiasm, and the\r\nunqualified audacity with which its claims were asserted--\r\n\r\n  The practice was introduced and recommended to the public by\r\n  its Author as a perfect antidote and security against Smallpox\r\n  without any exception or reserve, and capable of banishing\r\n  Variola from the catalogue of human misery. I have no hesitation\r\n  in confessing that I became an early convert and advocate of the\r\n  new practice; and it is now eight years and a-half since I have\r\n  uniformly advised and practised Vaccination, in which period\r\n  I may safely say, I have vaccinated upwards of twelve hundred\r\n  patients, and have only inoculated three at the positive request\r\n  of parents. This course I persevered in until the present time,\r\n  notwithstanding I met with several instances where it appeared\r\n  to fail in giving security; some about three years after the\r\n  introduction of the practice; a few more about two years ago; and\r\n  those which make part of the present volume within the last six\r\n  months.\r\n\r\nAn epidemic, in which his own perfectly vaccinated patients fell\r\nvictims to smallpox, at last opened his eyes to the delusion in\r\nwhich he was walking, and to the perversity with which he and\r\nothers had resisted the light of truth--\r\n\r\n  I am convinced from what has passed under my own observation\r\n  for the last three or four years, that we have been _all_\r\n  guilty of rejecting evidence that deserved more attention, in\r\n  consequence of the strong prepossessions which existed, from the\r\n  very persuasive proof of Vaccination resisting inoculation and\r\n  exposure to infection, and from our judgments being goaded and\r\n  overpowered with the _positive_ and _arbitrary_ opinions of its\r\n  abettors. I am now perfectly satisfied, from my mind being under\r\n  the influence of prejudice and blind to the impression of the\r\n  fairest evidence, that the last time Smallpox was prevalent, I\r\n  rejected and explained away many cases which were entitled to\r\n  the most serious attention, and showed myself as _violent_ and\r\n  _unreasonable_ a partisan as any of my brethren in propagating\r\n  a practice, which I have now little doubt we must ere long\r\n  surrender at discretion.\r\n\r\nWhen Brown first saw the vaccinated prostrate with smallpox, he\r\nconcluded that there must have been some mistake about their\r\nvaccination; “for after Vaccination it was impossible to contract\r\nSmallpox;” but the evidence of his senses gradually overcame the\r\nphantasy imposed upon him, and like an honest man he proclaimed his\r\nerror, and verified the experiences whereby he had been reluctantly\r\ncorrected. He set forth with all particulars forty-eight cases of\r\nsmallpox following vaccination within his own immediate cognizance,\r\nand though aware of many cases outside that cognizance, he limited\r\nhimself to what he could attest with personal assurance. He knew\r\nhe would be told that the vaccinations had been imperfect, or that\r\nwhat he took for smallpox was some other eruption--\r\n\r\n  It is strenuously contended [said Brown] by nearly every\r\n  author, and by almost every practitioner, that Vaccination is a\r\n  perfect antidote against Smallpox, if the disease be properly\r\n  communicated; and Dr. Jenner and his relative, Mr. G. Jenner,\r\n  positively assert, that they have had not one instance of\r\n  failure in their own practice. They all therefore, and without\r\n  hesitation, refer the whole series of failures that have been\r\n  brought forward to the sweeping power of imperfect Vaccination,\r\n  or to the blindness and stupidity of the medical practitioner who\r\n  cannot distinguish between Smallpox and Chickenpox, a rash, or\r\n  bug-bites.\r\n\r\nNor did Brown rest satisfied with proving that vaccination did\r\nnot prevent smallpox. He also showed the fallacy of the variolous\r\ntest. He adduced twelve cases in which vaccinated persons had been\r\nvariolated as if they had never been vaccinated. Also four cases in\r\nwhich vaccination and variolation were effected simultaneously, the\r\ndiseases running their courses concurrently, proving there was no\r\nantagonism between them; and since they could occur together, what\r\nreason was left for supposing that one might not succeed the other?\r\n\r\nHaving found liberty in the truth, he reverted to Jenner’s\r\nwritings, and reading them with opened eyes, he was not slow\r\nto detect and to demonstrate the laxity of statement, the\r\ncontradictions, and absurdities with which they were pervaded. No\r\nreply was attempted: no reply, indeed, was possible. The surgeons\r\nof the Edinburgh Vaccine Institution issued _An Examination of Mr.\r\nBrown’s Opinions and Statements_,[167] but they merely carped over\r\nnon-essential details, and left the main issues wholly unaffected.\r\nWhat they had to show was that Brown’s patients were either\r\nunvaccinated, or had not had smallpox; and unable to do this, they\r\nwere unable to do anything.\r\n\r\nBrown remained victor. He did not overthrow vaccination, nor\r\nrestore variolation, but he did make an end in Scotland of\r\nconfidence in vaccination as an omnipotent safeguard against\r\nsmallpox. The rite continued to be practised on humbler terms:\r\n“it did no harm”: even Mr. Brown allowed that it might keep off\r\nsmallpox for a time: and “there was reason to believe that it\r\ntended to make the disease milder when it did occur.” Thirty\r\nyears after his first publication, in 1842, Brown reaffirmed his\r\nposition in a series of letters[168] to Dr. George Gregory, a\r\nsympathetic friend, and advised a return to variolation in view\r\nof “the acknowledged defects of the Jennerian practice”--a dismal\r\nalternative. But it is in vain to expect any man to be _much_ in\r\nadvance of his time: it suffices for honourable distinction that\r\nhe _be_ in advance. When Brown commenced practice, smallpox and\r\nother fevers were regarded as inevitable as storms and earthquakes,\r\nand the knowledge with which we are now so familiar, that they\r\nare engendered in foul habits and habitations, was for practical\r\npurposes unknown. Our reproach is, that knowing so much better, we\r\nsurrender ourselves to a superstitious observance conceived in days\r\nof darkness.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[164] _Cases of Smallpox subsequent to Vaccination, with Facts\r\nand Observations read before the Medical Society at Portsmouth,\r\n29th March, 1804: addressed to the Directors of the Vaccine\r\nInstitution._ By William Goldson.

The faults of these men are frequently adduced\r\nas evidence of the absurd and brutal resistance with which\r\nVaccination was encountered, but it is forgotten how intense was\r\ntheir provocation, and how the bad on one side was matched by\r\nthe bad on the other. It was a contest between Smallpoxers and\r\nCowpoxers, alike ignorant of the conditions of physical well-being.\r\nIt is plain, however, in the light of our later experience, that\r\nmuch that was asserted by the Smallpoxers of the uselessness and\r\nharmfulness of cowpox must have been exactly and painfully true,\r\nthough persistently and ferociously denied.\r\n\r\nIn the _Edinburgh Review_ for October, 1806, appeared an article\r\nentitled “Pamphlets on Vaccine Inoculation,” which may be taken\r\nas a reflection of the state of the controversy at that date, and\r\nas an index to the chief offenders against propriety. The article\r\nwas written by the editor, Francis Jeffrey, and was a product of\r\nthat perspicuous intelligence, which reduced to order whatever was\r\nsubjected to its action, in much the same way that a housemaid\r\n“sets to rights” a library by ranging the books according to\r\ntheir sizes and bindings, and assorting the papers so that they\r\nlie neatly disposed. As is the habit of able editors, a view of\r\nthe variolous controversy was evolved that might be comfortably\r\naccepted and confidently repeated by his readers--the evolution\r\nof such rational mirage being regarded for the time as veracious\r\nmatter-of-fact.\r\n\r\nFirst we may take the reviewer’s evidence as to the extent and fury\r\nof the controversy--\r\n\r\n  The ample and public testimony offered in favour of Vaccination\r\n  seemed for a while to set the question at rest; and, except in a\r\n  few obscure pamphlets and communications to the medical journals,\r\n  little was heard in opposition to it, till 1804, when Mr.\r\n  Goldson of Portsmouth published six cases of Smallpox occurring\r\n  after Vaccination, accompanied with observations, calculated to\r\n  shake the confidence which was now very generally placed in the\r\n  security of the Jennerian inoculation. These were answered by\r\n  Mr. Ring and others, who endeavoured to show that, in some of\r\n  his cases, Mr. Goldson’s patients had not had the genuine Cowpox\r\n  in the first instance, and that in others, they had not had the\r\n  genuine Smallpox thereafter. This part of the controversy was\r\n  conducted with temper, and with a reasonable degree of candour.\r\n  In the end of the same year however, Dr. Moseley published his\r\n  treatise on the Cowpox, in which the ravings of Bedlam seemed to\r\n  be blended with the tropes of Billingsgate. Dr. Rowley followed\r\n  on the same side, and in the same temper, with 500 cases of\r\n  “the beastly new diseases produced from Cowpox,” and attracted\r\n  customers by two coloured engravings at the head of his work\r\n  of “the Cowpoxed, ox-faced boy,” and the “Cowpoxed, mangey\r\n  girl.” The battle now became general. The Reverend Rowland Hill\r\n  thundered in defence of vaccination--Dr. Squirrel leaped from\r\n  his cage upon the whole herd of vaccinators--Mr. Birch insisted\r\n  upon stating his serious reasons for objecting to Cowpox--Drs.\r\n  Thornton and Lettsom chanted pæans in its praise--Mr. Lipscomb\r\n  strutted forward with a ponderous, wordy dissertation on its\r\n  failures and mischiefs; and Messrs. Ring, Merriman, and Blair\r\n  answered everybody; and exasperated all their opponents by their\r\n  intemperance and personality. Charges of murder and falsehood\r\n  were interchanged among the disputants without the smallest\r\n  ceremony; the medical journals foamed with the violence of their\r\n  contention; it raged in hospitals and sick-chambers; and polluted\r\n  with its malignity the sanctity of the pulpit and the harmony of\r\n  convivial philanthropy.\r\n\r\n  In the whole course of our censorial labours, we have never had\r\n  occasion to contemplate a scene so disgusting and humiliating as\r\n  is presented by the greater part of this controversy; nor do we\r\n  believe that the virulence of political animosity or personal\r\n  rivalry or revenge ever gave rise, among the lowest and most\r\n  prostituted scribblers, to so much coarseness, illiberality,\r\n  violence and absurdity as is here exhibited by gentlemen of\r\n  sense and education discussing a point of professional science\r\n  with a view to the good of mankind. At one time, indeed, we\r\n  were so overpowered and confounded by the clamour and vehement\r\n  contradictions of the combatants, that we were tempted to abandon\r\n  the task we had undertaken, and leave it to some more athletic\r\n  critic to collect the few facts and the little reasoning which\r\n  could be discerned in this tempest of the medical world.\r\n\r\nFurious was the controversy, but why was it furious? There are\r\noften great fights over little matters, but the reason is that\r\nthe little matters are vitally related to the self-love of the\r\ncombatants; and thus it was with the Cowpoxers and the Smallpoxers.\r\nThe Cowpoxers set out with the absolute assertion that whoever\r\nsubmitted to their prescription would be secure from smallpox for\r\nlife. Without proof, or with powerful sham proof, the assertion was\r\nendorsed by the mass of the medical profession, and there followed\r\nthe conversion of the community in that sort of faith-panic which\r\nis described by Carlyle as Swarmery--\r\n\r\n  All the world assenting, and continually repeating and\r\n  reverberating, there soon comes that singular phenomenon called\r\n  Swarmery, or the gathering of men in swarms; and what prodigies\r\n  they are in the habit of doing and believing when thrown into\r\n  that miraculous condition! Singular, in the case of human swarms,\r\n  with what perfection of unanimity and quasi-religious conviction\r\n  the stupidest absurdities can be received as axioms of Euclid,\r\n  nay, as articles of faith, which you are not only to believe,\r\n  unless malignantly insane, but are (if you have any honour or\r\n  morality) to push into practice, and, without delay see _done_,\r\n  if your soul would live.[169]\r\n\r\nPeople thus enchanted do not like to be brought to their senses;\r\nand medical men, who in 1800 attested the perpetual prophylaxy\r\nof cowpox, were naturally very unwilling to be proved deceivers\r\nand deceived. When cases of smallpox were reported as following\r\nvaccination, they at first denied the possibility, saying that\r\neither there had been no vaccination, or that the smallpox was\r\nnot smallpox. On the other hand, the Smallpoxers who had been\r\nsnuffed out by the Cowpoxers, revived in presence of the discovered\r\nimpotence of the new practice, and stoutly maintained, and cruelly\r\ndemonstrated that unquestionable vaccinations were followed by\r\nunquestionable smallpox. It needs little acquaintance with human\r\nnature to see unlimited elements of bitterness in these conditions.\r\nTo be convicted of imposture does not beget equanimity, nor\r\ncontradiction as to plain matter-of-fact; and thus convicted were\r\nthe Cowpoxers and thus contradicted were the Smallpoxers.\r\n\r\nThe Edinburgh reviewer described Dr. Moseley’s treatise on\r\ncowpox as blending “the ravings of Bedlam with the tropes of\r\nBillingsgate.” Some Billingsgate I concede, but not Bedlam at all.\r\nMuch however depends on the point of view. Vaccination if regarded\r\nas a blessing in which the inspiration of heaven was consummated\r\nin the salvation of the human race from smallpox,[170] resistance\r\nthereto might appear, as Carlyle observes of creatures under\r\nenchantment, as “malignantly insane.”\r\n\r\nDr. Moseley’s book,[171] it is to be allowed, was singularly\r\nexasperating. He had spoken against cowpox from the outset, and was\r\ncharged with condemning that of which he knew nothing; to which he\r\ncogently replied that he could scarcely know less than the gang of\r\nmedical men who attested its perpetual efficacy in the newspapers\r\nin 1800 before they had any proper experience of it whatever. If\r\nhis scepticism was premature, what was their credulity? Moseley\r\nhad patience: no argument could be heard in the rage that set in\r\nfor the new salvation. “Cowpox, I admit, is not contagious,” he\r\nsaid, “but cow-mania is.” When, however, in process of time it was\r\nseen in hundreds of cases that cowpox conferred no immunity from\r\nsmallpox, he published in 1804 _Lues Bovilla_--a somewhat pompous\r\ntreatise, with frequent touches of superfluous learning, and\r\npermeated with the irritating superiority of the true prophet--“You\r\nsee it has turned out just as I predicted.” Nor was he content to\r\nmake general assertions: he specified the names and addresses of\r\nthose who had been correctly vaccinated, or had taken cowpox from\r\nthe cow, and had subsequently suffered from smallpox with their\r\nneighbours; also of cases of severe illness, injury, and death\r\nresulting from vaccination. Bluster was idle in presence of such\r\nfacts. Even the Royal Jennerians had to eat humble pie, for in\r\ntheir Report, dated 2nd January, 1806, we read--\r\n\r\n  It is admitted by the Committee that a few cases have been\r\n  brought before them of persons having the Smallpox who had\r\n  apparently passed through the Cowpox in a regular way.\r\n\r\nWith so much admitted by such furious fanatics, what might not be\r\ninferred!\r\n\r\nMoseley was held in high esteem alike by the profession and the\r\npublic, and his judgment enforced by so much serious evidence\r\ncontributed heavily to the discredit of vaccination, and\r\nunfortunately to the resumption of variolous inoculation. That the\r\nreaction was extensive, especially in London, appears from numerous\r\ncontemporary testimonies, which Moseley confirms in saying--\r\n\r\n  The people at large are not to be reproached for putting their\r\n  faith in this splendid imposition on humanity; and to the\r\n  credit of their discernment and parental feelings, the middle\r\n  and inferior classes have taken precedence in renouncing the\r\n  delusion. At this moment, unless attacked by surprise, or with\r\n  threats, or cajoled by artifice (all of which have been practised\r\n  on them) there are now none among them in London and the adjacent\r\n  villages who will expose their children to Cowpox Inoculation.\r\n\r\nRowland Hill was a religious and philanthropic notable in those\r\ndays, and in common with many of his kind, was an enthusiastic\r\nvaccinator. A leading spirit in the Royal Jennerian Society, he had\r\nthe school-room of Surrey Chapel constituted a vaccination station\r\nwhereat Dr. Walker officiated. Nor was he content to patronise the\r\npractice, but was himself an energetic operator. Speaking at the\r\nannual meeting of the Jennerian Society, 17th May, 1806, he said--\r\n\r\n  “With my own hands I have vaccinated upwards of 5000 persons,”\r\n  and, lifting up his eyes to heaven, exclaimed, “I solemnly\r\n  declare before God, I have not had a failure in a single\r\n  instance. What then shall we say of the false and daring\r\n  publications of those who denounce the benign practice, and how\r\n  shall they answer for their conduct to their King, their Country,\r\n  and their God!”\r\n\r\nHill and Jenner were great friends. Hill visited Jenner at\r\nBerkeley, and Jenner heard Hill when he preached at Cheltenham.\r\nIntroducing Jenner to a nobleman, Hill remarked--\r\n\r\n“Allow me to present to your Lordship my friend Dr. Jenner, who has\r\nbeen the means of saving more lives than any other man.”\r\n\r\nTo which Jenner, being of a pious turn, sighed with meek effusion--\r\n\r\n“Ah! would I, like you, could say _souls_.”[172]\r\n\r\nSo committed and so possessed, Hill naturally resented the growing\r\ndistrust of vaccination. It cut him deeply to be supposed a quack;\r\nand in 1806 he issued a pamphlet[173] relating his experiences as a\r\nJennerite, defending his practice, and denouncing those who treated\r\nit despitefully. Moseley especially was subjected to severe and\r\ncontemptuous condemnation. Hill’s sanctimony and virulence, his\r\nvigour and venom compose a piquant mixture, and if we could tarry\r\nfor amusement we might produce it abundantly from a variety of\r\nelegant extracts. Consider, for instance, this his adjuration, and\r\nits pitiful object--\r\n\r\n  Oh, the blessing of the Jennerian inoculation! Did ever man stand\r\n  as Jenner so much like an Angel of God, an instrument in the\r\n  hands of Divine Providence between the living and the dead till\r\n  the plague was stayed!\r\n\r\nHill’s latent assumption throughout his discourse was--\r\n\r\nFirst, that all must have smallpox; and\r\n\r\nSecond, that all the vaccinated who escaped smallpox, owed their\r\nsalvation to their Jennerisation.\r\n\r\nIt never apparently occurred to him that before Jenner was\r\nheard of, many passed through life exempt from smallpox; nor,\r\nconsequently, did he inquire _how_ they escaped; nor _why_, when\r\nvaccination was introduced, escape should be placed to its credit.\r\n\r\nThe belief in the vicarious influence of vaccination comes out\r\nstrongly, too, in Hill’s pamphlet. Of Londoners there were then\r\nover 1,000,000, and of these, he says, at least, 100,000 had been\r\nvaccinated, and with this effect--\r\n\r\n  Vaccination reduced the deaths from Smallpox in London to 10 per\r\n  week; but after the Inoculators had been making their clamours,\r\n  the applicants for Vaccination diminished, and the deaths soon\r\n  rose to 100 per week.\r\n\r\n  Now can effrontery itself deny that the introduction of\r\n  Vaccination was the sole cause of reducing the fatality on the\r\n  Smallpox list?\r\n\r\nThus one in ten being vaccinated, smallpox was reduced throughout\r\nthe unvaccinated 9-10ths; and as soon as the vicarious operations\r\ndropped, up went the rate of mortality! Nor was Hill singular in\r\nthis persuasion. He cited his friend Dr. Lettsom as writing to him,\r\n25th March, 1806--\r\n\r\n  Vaccination was gradually lessening the mortality in 1804, when\r\n  about the middle of 1805 false reports against Vaccination gained\r\n  very general credit, and Vaccination was nearly suspended;\r\n  the consequence was the death of 1286 children in four months\r\n  (September to December) or ten every day, each of whom might now\r\n  have been alive had the blessing of Vaccination been accepted.\r\n\r\nAnd again I find Lettsom wrote to Moseley, November, 1808--\r\n\r\n  The increase of births and decrease of deaths has added 3000\r\n  lives annually to the population of London during the period that\r\n  Vaccination has been practised.\r\n\r\nTalk evidently sincere, and widely repeated, but with how little\r\nconsideration for truth!\r\n\r\nTo return to Moseley. He was not the man to endure Hill’s\r\naggression submissively, and in a pamphlet entitled _An Oliver\r\nfor a Rowland_,[174] he made a terrific reprisal. The public\r\nwere delighted with it, and in the course of a few months it ran\r\nthrough ten editions. Hill was generally regarded as a clerical\r\nmountebank, with more impudence than piety, and to see him knocked\r\nover, kicked, and rolled in the mire, was sport that carried many\r\nsympathisers. Moseley’s opening address gives the key to the whole\r\nperformance--\r\n\r\n  ROWLAND,--I bought your pamphlet, entitled _Cowpox Inoculation\r\n  Vindicated_, dated the 25th of March, 1806.\r\n\r\n  I paid a shilling for it. Rowland,--it is not dear. The same\r\n  quantity of folly, falsehood, and impudence, could not have been\r\n  bought for twice the money of any other Cowpoxer from the Ganges\r\n  to the Mississippi.\r\n\r\n  But let me ask you, Rowland, what could induce you to take\r\n  up your pen to attack me on the subject of Physic, who never\r\n  attacked you on the subject of Religion? Would it not have been\r\n  more prudent in you to have continued to expose yourself in your\r\n  own trade in your own shop?\r\n\r\n  As to my learned friend Dr. Lettsom (who is never out of the way\r\n  when there is good to be done) being moved to instigate you, a\r\n  Methodist parson, to enter into a medical controversy--that can\r\n  only be accounted for by supposing he owes you a grudge, and put\r\n  you into my hands for payment.\r\n\r\nPaid he was with interest--gross and Rabelaisian; and Hill, when he\r\nhad picked himself up and recovered his senses, discreetly retired\r\nfrom the combat.\r\n\r\nSpite of his pomposity and buffoonery, there was good sense and\r\nhumour in Moseley, and his resistance to the Jennerian mania was\r\nnot ineffective. As he wrote in 1808--\r\n\r\n  It is ten years since I began this Trojan war against Vaccinia;\r\n  and if it be not yet ended, I have at least the satisfaction\r\n  to see that her original troops are no longer able to defend\r\n  her throne; and that the mobled Queen with “a clout upon her\r\n  head where late diadem stood,” has fallen to a new dynasty of\r\n  mercenaries.[175]\r\n\r\nIn Dr. Munk’s _Roll of the Royal College of Physicians_ we read,\r\nthat Dr. Moseley was appointed physician to Chelsea Hospital in\r\n1788, “an office which he filled with the highest _éclat_ for more\r\nthan thirty years”--until his death in 1819--\r\n\r\n  Though a shrewd practitioner, and undeniably a man of extensive\r\n  mental capacity and very considerable attainments, Dr.\r\n  Moseley was a violent opponent of Vaccination, on which his\r\n  communications to the press were incessant. They did little\r\n  credit to his medical penetration, or his qualifications as\r\n  a dispassionate searcher after truth, and, happily for his\r\n  reputation, are now well nigh forgotten.[176]\r\n\r\nAre they? For what else is Dr. Moseley remembered? So that a man\r\ndoes his duty in the world, whether he be forgotten or remembered\r\nis not worth a thought; but Moseley’s early and steadfast\r\nresistance to the Cowpox Imposture will long constitute his title\r\nto grateful recollection.\r\n\r\nDr. William Rowley, Physician to the Marylebone Infirmary, also\r\nleft his mark in medical history as a determined opponent of\r\nvaccination. He had seen the profession and the public go mad\r\nabout so many absurd novelties, that it did not surprise him\r\nthat they should go mad about cowpox: and after due experience\r\nand investigation he delivered judgment on the craze and its\r\npernicious effects in a pamphlet entitled _Cowpox Inoculation no\r\nSecurity against Smallpox_,[177] containing two coloured engravings\r\nrepresenting the Cowpoxed Ox-Faced Boy, and the Cowpoxed Mangey\r\nGirl. Much ridicule was expended on these pictures, and to this\r\nday whoever wishes to be funny and create giggle over the early\r\nresistance to vaccination tells how one Dr. Rowley maintained\r\nthat Jenner’s benign virus induced the face of an ox on a boy;\r\nbut like the majority of comic anecdotes, it is untrue. The\r\nengraving represents a comely lad with a swelling on the upper\r\npart of his left cheek, which was thought to give that side of\r\nhis face an ox-like expression. Many a medical practitioner among\r\nthe poor would at this day have little difficulty in presenting\r\nliving examples of affliction answering to Rowley’s pictures--and\r\nworse. It was, moreover, the fear or fancy of many at the time\r\nthat inoculation with cowpox might beget bovine characteristics\r\nin the human species, and the fear or fancy was turned to\r\ninevitable account in jest and earnest. The jest is visible in\r\nsome of Rowlandson’s caricatures, and stories like this got into\r\ncirculation--\r\n\r\n  A child at Peckham, after being inoculated with Cowpox, had its\r\n  former natural disposition absolutely changed to the brutal,\r\n  so that it ran upon all fours like a _beast_, bellowing like a\r\n  _cow_, and butting like a _bull_.\r\n\r\nIn order to discredit Rowley, it is thought fair policy to connect\r\nhim with such nonsense, and to have it supposed that he rested\r\nhis case upon “the cowpoxed ox-faced boy:” it was far otherwise.\r\nHe diligently tracked the vaccinators, and accumulated 504\r\ncases of smallpox and injury after vaccination with 75 deaths,\r\nparticulars being accurately specified. Nor was he content merely\r\nto report what he had ascertained. “Come and see,” was his forcible\r\nargument. “I have lately had under my care,” he wrote, “some\r\nof the worst species of malignant smallpox in the Marylebone\r\nInfirmary, which many of the faculty have examined and know to\r\nhave been vaccinated.” His trust in “Come and see,” he still more\r\npowerfully exemplified in an exhibition of the injuries inflicted\r\nby vaccination in his Lecture Room in Savile Row in October, 1805.\r\n“Knowing,” he said, “the caviling character of the Cowpoxers,\r\nI determined to leave them no hole for retreat”; and therefore\r\nhe brought together Joules, “the ox-faced boy, who also had a\r\nterribly diseased elbow-joint”; Marianne Lewis, the mangey girl,\r\n“who was covered with blotches like a leopard”; “a load of children\r\nin a cart from the south of London,” and others accompanied by\r\ntheir parents, and displaying their various maladies, said, “Behold\r\nthe effects of the new disease that has been taken from the cow and\r\nimplanted in humanity!” This painful exposition was continued over\r\ntwo days, and as he records, “the scene was truly affecting and\r\ndistressing to all who witnessed it.” An antagonist like Rowley is\r\na serious factor in any controversy, and we may estimate the havoc\r\nhe wrought by the extreme anxiety of the Jennerites to have him\r\nestimated by the supposed absurdity of the ox-faced boy.\r\n\r\nTo a man of practical temper like Rowley, the enthusiasm with which\r\nvaccination was at first advocated appeared akin to delirium--\r\n\r\n  I have been in some vaccination storms, and have had the buttons\r\n  torn off my coat, cloth and all, to convince me of the great and\r\n  infallible excellence of Cowpox. I have seen some of the vehement\r\n  vaccinators redden like a flame with fury, their lips quivering,\r\n  their eyes starting out of their heads, their mouths foaming,\r\n  their tongues dropping hard words, and their fists clenched like\r\n  pugilists, ready to accompany their violent wrath with other\r\n  knock-down arguments. In such circumstances, mild, investigating\r\n  Philosophy quits the scene and leaves the field of battle to the\r\n  Bedlamites.\r\n\r\nThe fury had subsided in 1805, and Rowley held that many medical\r\nmen were deeply ashamed of the extravagance into which they had\r\nbeen committed, but lacked courage to make frank confession.\r\n\r\nRowley died in 1806, and the regard in which he was held was\r\nmanifest in the crowds who flocked to his funeral. In the _Roll of\r\nPhysicians_, Dr. Munk observes--\r\n\r\n  Dr. Rowley was a determined opponent of Vaccination, and obtained\r\n  an unenviable notoriety by his association with Dr. Moseley in\r\n  opposing every conceivable obstacle to the reception and progress\r\n  of that invaluable discovery.\r\n\r\nThe obstacles interposed were matters-of-fact, and as\r\nmatters-of-fact were recognised and prevailed.\r\n\r\nThe controversy that followed the introduction of Vaccination\r\n“gave birth,” says the Edinburgh reviewer, “to an infinite number\r\nof publications of all descriptions” from which he could only\r\nselect the most characteristic. Among these we find Dr. Squirrel,\r\nwhose book is described “as the most entertaining of the whole”--\r\n\r\n  We will venture to say, though we know it to be a bold assertion,\r\n  that there never was anything so ill-written, or so vulgar and\r\n  absurd, produced before by a person entitling himself a Doctor of\r\n  Medicine. There is a certain nimbleness and agility about him,\r\n  however, which keeps us in good humour, and he whisks about with\r\n  such a self-satisfied springiness and activity, that it is really\r\n  enlivening to look on him.\r\n\r\nTurning up Squirrel’s pamphlet[178] I find little or nothing to\r\nwarrant this description. It is not ill-written, if judged by\r\nthe standard of medical literature, and the “springiness” is a\r\nconceit of the reviewer’s to sport with the Doctor’s name. My own\r\nimpression is that Squirrel was a dull fellow, jealous of cowpox\r\nas injurious to the trade in smallpox inoculation, and that he\r\navailed himself of the depression in the vaccination business to\r\nassert its superiority. He admits, indeed, that he kept silent\r\nduring the Jennerian furore, “but the overwhelming torrent being\r\ngradually reduced to a feeble current,” he reckoned that he “might\r\nnow promulgate his opinion with a reasonable hope of success.” He\r\ncites Jenner’s account of the origin of cowpox in the greasy heels\r\nof horses, and proceeds to argue that the disease is scrofula,\r\nwhich its inoculation is certain to diffuse, whilst affording no\r\nprotection from smallpox. He then adduces a number of cases in\r\nproof that inoculated cowpox had not averted smallpox, and had in\r\nseveral instances brought on serious and fatal ailments.\r\n\r\nJenner in a letter to Moore from Berkeley, 28th February, 1810,\r\nthus refers to Squirrel--\r\n\r\n  John Gale Jones, I see, has at length succeeded in obtaining the\r\n  situation for which he has long been a candidate. This fellow\r\n  had once the impudence to desire a man to call on me in Bedford\r\n  Place to say, that he, Jones, would advise me immediately to quit\r\n  London, for there was no knowing what an enraged populace might\r\n  do. He was the writer of Squirrel’s book, the long anti-vaccine\r\n  columns in the _Independent Whig_, and many of the most violent\r\n  papers in the _Medical Observer_. I was held up in his Forum for\r\n  several nights as an object of derision; but I silenced him by\r\n  the same weapon as I have others--contempt.[179]\r\n\r\nJenner’s contempt was of a miraculous quality, operating insensibly\r\nupon those to whom it was applied. Some might fancy it was his\r\nidleness and others his cowardice; but he knew that it was _his\r\ncontempt_, and that it blasted his adversaries in much the same way\r\nthat vaccination blasted smallpox.\r\n\r\nThere is the woeful monotony of truth in these old pamphlets,\r\nnot merely in the occurrence of smallpox after vaccination, but\r\nin the sadder stories of acute and chronic blood-poisoning. We\r\nrecognise the narratives as true, for they are reproduced among us\r\ncontinuously by the same means, with the same miseries and agonies,\r\nand with the same death for grateful release.\r\n\r\nIt is clear from the testimony of Moseley, Rowley and Squirrel,\r\nconfirmed too by others and by the Jennerites themselves, that\r\nthe extension of vaccination met with a decided check in London.\r\nIt was proved to many in a fashion that did not admit of dispute,\r\nthat vaccination conferred no security from smallpox, whilst it was\r\nattended with dangers to health, certain if as yet undefinable.\r\nVariolous inoculation was again reverted to, but by diminished\r\nnumbers; for that practice never had prevailed with popular\r\ngood-will, but through sedulous medical persuasion as duty of\r\ndire necessity. Vaccination afforded excuse for hesitation, and,\r\nbetween rival claims, many contrived to elude either form of\r\npollution. Thus indirectly as it were, vaccine inoculation set\r\naside variolous, and when in 1840 the latter was forbidden by law,\r\nthere was little of the practice left, whilst at the same time the\r\nmajority of the population existed without Jennerian protection.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be forgotten that the early resistance to vaccination\r\nproceeded entirely from inoculators with smallpox. It was as yet\r\nunimagined that smallpox and other fevers were preventible, that\r\ntheir causes lay within control, and that health was the best\r\ndefence of health. The world as yet lay in darkness as to those\r\ntruths which we now recognise as laws of health, hygiene, and\r\nsanitary science; nor has the darkness rolled away, but is rolling\r\naway, and the time is not distant when to be vaccinated in order to\r\nbe safe from smallpox will be accounted the drollest of absurdities.\r\n\r\nGoing back to the _Edinburgh Review_, we remark with curious\r\ninterest how the chief position then asserted was the abiding\r\nefficacy of vaccination. Inoculators were ready to concede that it\r\nmight possess a temporary prophylaxy, inasmuch as until one blood\r\nfever had subsided another was unlikely to supervene; but this view\r\nJeffrey declined to entertain--\r\n\r\n  It seems contrary to all analogy, and all rules of reasoning\r\n  to suppose, _a priori_, that an immunity which is found to\r\n  subsist for a certain time in the usual and healthful state of\r\n  the system, will gradually and insensibly wear away without\r\n  any apparent cause, or any sensible change to indicate its\r\n  extinction; and the facts which bear at all upon the question, so\r\n  far from suggesting or supporting such a supposition, seem, in\r\n  our apprehension, completely to refute and discredit it.\r\n\r\nYet what in 1806 was accounted “contrary to all analogy,”\r\nand “completely refuted and discredited by facts,” is\r\nprecisely what vaccinators now admit. Hence their cry for\r\nre-vaccination--septennially, triennially, annually. Dr. Lionel\r\nBeale, a great authority in the matter, recently owned to having\r\nbeen vaccinated ten times, and in terror of an epidemic was\r\nabout to be vaccinated once more--a striking exemplification of\r\ncontemporary theory and practice. To have foreseen such an issue\r\nwould have confounded the early vaccinators. When re-vaccination\r\nwas mentioned to Dr. Pearson, he denied its possibility; “for,”\r\nsaid he, “Vaccination is equivalent to smallpox, which cannot\r\nrecur. If a child can be re-vaccinated, then it can take smallpox;\r\n_ergo_ vaccination is not an equivalent for smallpox; and where\r\nthen is the good of it?” Where indeed!\r\n\r\nThe Edinburgh reviewer was sufficiently impartial to recognise\r\nviolence alike among Cowpoxers and Smallpoxers, and specified John\r\nPing, Jenner’s bully, as an offender, describing his _Treatise on\r\nCowpox_ as “one thousand and forty chaotic pages in defence of the\r\nnew practice.” Ring verified the criticism by issuing a pamphlet,\r\n_The Beauties of the Edinburgh Review_ alias _the Stink-Pot of\r\nLiterature_; reminding us of the man who writing to his wife from\r\nan inn-parlour remarked, “I must conclude, for an unmannerly\r\nIrishman is looking over my shoulder and reading every word I\r\nwrite;” an observation that was immediately clenched with, “You are\r\na liar, sir; a liar!”\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[169] _Shooting Niagara._\r\n\r\n[170] “Neglect not, I exhort you, such proffered blessing.

It is\r\na question difficult to answer; and yet, as I propose to show that\r\nCobbett’s opposition to vaccination was justified by common-sense,\r\nI am bound to give some definition of the term.\r\n\r\nCommon-sense is reason as evolved from common experience. What\r\nthe multitude of men have found to be true in the course of\r\nlife, that is common-sense, which to question or resist is folly\r\nor fanaticism. This vulgar and vigorous rationality is often\r\nsummoned to service where it has no vocation. For example, when\r\nit was first taught that the earth was a sphere and that its\r\ninhabitants had antipodes, the revelation was denounced as contrary\r\nto common-sense; but it is obvious that in such a case (which\r\nrepresents myriads) it was wrongly invoked; the form of the earth\r\nbeing at the time outside common cognisance. As soon, however,\r\nas it was realised by experience that the earth was spherical\r\nand inhabited in all its quarters, then its rotundity became\r\nincorporated in the constitution of common-sense.\r\n\r\nThe realm of common-sense I therefore hold to be limited by its\r\norigin in common experience, and in matters above or beyond\r\nthat experience, its dicta are illegitimate, and synonyms for\r\npresumption and prejudice.\r\n\r\nWilliam Cobbett was essentially a man of common-sense. His power\r\nlay in his community with the experience and reason of his\r\ncountrymen; and, like all of us, he had the defects of his virtue.\r\nHe continually applied his vulgar judgment to the criticism of men\r\nand matters beyond the range of his competence, and the result was\r\na luxuriance of arrogance and contempt for which at this day we\r\nmust resort to Mr. Ruskin for a parallel.\r\n\r\nSuch being the case, we have to inquire, What was the worth of\r\nCobbett’s opinion in the matter of vaccination? The attempt\r\nis sometimes made by vaccinators to withdraw their practice\r\nfrom popular discussion. They say it is a medical question for\r\nmedical men; but the assertion provokes suspicion rather than\r\nconfidence, for mystery is an invariable note of imposture. It\r\nis fair, I allow, to say of any abstruse knowledge that it can\r\nonly be apprehended by those whose faculties are trained for its\r\napprehension; but what is there abstruse about vaccination? With\r\nlittle trouble, everybody may know as much about it as anybody.\r\nIt is the simplest of surgical operations. It is almost as easy\r\nas taking pills--instead of putting poison down the throat it is\r\ninserted into the skin. The operation may result in any number of\r\npathological complications, but whether such complications be\r\nadmitted or denied, what vaccination is prescribed for, namely,\r\nthe prevention of smallpox, comes within the range of common\r\nobservation. What, therefore, I have to answer is, that Cobbett’s\r\ncommon-sense was competent to deliver judgment upon vaccination.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the circumstances of the time compelled an opinion:\r\nsilence or neutrality was impossible. England was swarming with\r\nvaccinators. All the fussy folk who had a taste for doing much good\r\nat little cost were plying the cowpox lancet. Encouraged by Jenner,\r\nthey got vaccine, inoculated a victim, and propagated the virus\r\nfrom arm to arm. Here I may let Cobbett speak for himself--\r\n\r\n  This nation is fond of quackery of all sorts; and this particular\r\n  quackery having been sanctioned by King, Lords, and Commons, it\r\n  spread over the country like a pestilence borne by the winds.\r\n  Speedily sprang up the Royal Jennerian Institution, and branch\r\n  institutions issuing from the parent trunk, set instantly to\r\n  work, impregnating the veins of the rising generation with the\r\n  beastly matter. Gentlemen and ladies made the commodity a pocket\r\n  companion; and if a cottager’s child was seen by them on a common\r\n  (in Hampshire at least) and did not quickly take to its heels, it\r\n  was certain to carry off more or less of the disease of the cow.\r\n  One would have thought that half the cows in the country had been\r\n  tapped to get such a quantity of stuff.[180]\r\n\r\nNor was vaccination merely forced on Cobbett’s attention as a\r\npopular craze. He had to deal with it as a possible compulsory\r\ninfliction. At a public meeting in 1803, Wilberforce and Dr.\r\nClarke advocated the prohibition of smallpox inoculation and the\r\nenforcement of vaccination; and Cobbett, in a letter addressed to\r\nWilberforce, rebuked the arbitrary project in a strain impressive\r\nand dignified as that of Burke himself. He wrote--\r\n\r\n  It seems there are prejudices against cowpox which it is\r\n  necessary to destroy by force. That there are prejudices, and\r\n  very strong ones too, I am ready to allow, but I cannot agree\r\n  that these prejudices should be eradicated by force; nor is it\r\n  perhaps fair to use the degrading term as expressive of the\r\n  dislike which so large a portion of the community entertain to\r\n  the practice you are so anxious to compel them to adopt. The\r\n  charge of prejudice has been preferred but too often, and with\r\n  but too fatal success against every one opposed to change. The\r\n  truth is that whoever has been found to object to innovation,\r\n  however wild in itself, however destructive in its consequences,\r\n  has constantly been accused of prejudice; and as prejudice thus\r\n  used implies a mixture of _ignorance_ and _perverseness_, and as\r\n  few persons are willing to be thought ignorant and perverse, the\r\n  imputation is employed to coerce assent where reason hesitates.\r\n\r\nHe then aptly applied the repudiated recommendation of inoculation\r\nwith smallpox as cause for hesitation in assenting to inoculation\r\nwith cowpox--\r\n\r\n  There was, you must well remember, a strong and general\r\n  objection, which for a long time prevailed, against Inoculation\r\n  with Smallpox; and you cannot have forgotten that this objection\r\n  was termed _prejudice_, and the persons entertaining it were\r\n  regarded as _illiterate_, _ignorant_, or _perverse_; yet it now\r\n  appears from the Address of your Royal Jennerian Society that\r\n  it would have been well for the human race if the prejudices of\r\n  those illiterate, ignorant, or perverse persons had universally\r\n  obtained; for you now tell us that “Inoculation by spreading the\r\n  contagion has considerably increased the mortality of Smallpox.”\r\n  With an example like this before our eyes, Ought we not to be\r\n  very cautious how we adopt your new system of Inoculation with\r\n  Cowpox?\r\n\r\nThen turning upon Wilberforce in his favourite character of\r\nconstitutional Englishman, he proceeded--\r\n\r\n  Give me leave to ask you, Sir, how you reconcile a proposition to\r\n  enforce this novel practice with the spirit of that Constitution\r\n  of which you profess to be so great an admirer, and with that\r\n  freedom of which you wish to be regarded as one of the principal\r\n  supporters? What I am opposed to, and what I am alarmed at, is\r\n  the proposition to obtain an Act of Parliament which would in its\r\n  operation be nothing short of compulsion on every man to suffer\r\n  the veins of his child to be impregnated with the disease of a\r\n  beast--a measure to be adopted in no country where the people are\r\n  not vassals or slaves.\r\n\r\nLastly came these remarks which at this day have force and\r\napplication greater even than when written--\r\n\r\n  I like not this never-ending recurrence to Acts of Parliament.\r\n  Something must be left, and something _ought_ to be left, to the\r\n  sense and reason and morality and religion of the people. There\r\n  are a set of _well-meaning men_ in this country, who would pass\r\n  laws for the regulating and restraining of every feeling of the\r\n  human breast, and every motion of the human frame: they would\r\n  bind us down, hair by hair, as the Liliputians did Gulliver, till\r\n  anon, when we awoke from our sleep, we should wonder by whom we\r\n  had been enslaved. But I trust, Sir, that Parliament is not, and\r\n  never will be, so far under the influence of these minute and\r\n  meddling politicians as to be induced to pass laws for taking out\r\n  of a man’s hands the management of his household, the choice of\r\n  his physician, and the care of the health of his children; for,\r\n  under this sort of domiciliary thraldom, to talk of the liberty\r\n  of the country would be the most cruel mockery wherewith an\r\n  humble and subjected people were ever insulted.[181]\r\n\r\nCobbett, be it observed, thus addressed Wilberforce in 1803, when\r\nvaccination was as yet imperfectly tested, and its advocates\r\nwere in the full blast of enthusiastic persuasion that to be\r\nJennerised was to be made proof against smallpox for ever. When\r\nCobbett had again occasion to write about cowpox, six years had\r\npassed away, bearing with them the phantastic certainty with which\r\nvaccination had been imposed upon public credulity. Nevertheless\r\nthe practice was not abandoned: quackery once alive and lucrative,\r\ndies hard: but it was discredited, and its apologists exercised\r\ntheir ingenuity in devising explanations and excuses for its\r\nmanifest failures. The Royal Jennerian Society had split between\r\nJenner and Walker, and application to Parliament was resolved\r\nupon for two purposes--first, to save Jenner from poverty; and\r\nsecond, to provide funds for the maintenance of vaccination,\r\nvoluntary subscriptions having fallen off irretrievably. In short,\r\nvaccination had broken down, and the House of Commons was called\r\nupon to save it from extinction. There were wire-pullers in the\r\nHouse and out of the House who were compromised by their patronage\r\nof Jenner and his imposture, and they had the craft and the power\r\nto transfer the responsibility of which they were sick to the\r\nnational exchequer. With this explanation, we shall understand the\r\nfollowing article from the _Register_ of 18th June, 1808. Cobbett\r\nwrote--\r\n\r\n  This experiment with Cowpox, which has cost the nation £30,000\r\n  to Dr. Jenner, is now, it seems, to have an Act of Parliament\r\n  to give it currency. Mr. Rose has brought in a bill for the\r\n  purpose of establishing a central institution in London for the\r\n  distribution of Cowpox matter, which bill in all appearance will\r\n  pass; and this disgusting and degrading remedy will cost the\r\n  nation another £4,000 or £5,000 annually, though it has been\r\n  clearly proved not to have answered the purpose intended. This,\r\n  however, I regard as cheap when compared with the menace of Mr.\r\n  Fuller, who, in the debate, proposed a compulsory law on the\r\n  subject. He took up the old idea of Mr. Wilberforce, who was for\r\n  a law to prevent parents from having their children inoculated\r\n  with Smallpox unless they chose to send them to pest-houses,\r\n  or to some place at a considerable distance from any other\r\n  habitations. This cruel and tyrannical proposition I opposed\r\n  at the time; and I am happy to perceive that it is now almost\r\n  universally exploded.\r\n\r\nWhilst Cobbett could not arrest the action of Parliament, he\r\nwas short-sighted in considering that the proposed endowment of\r\nvaccination was merely a question of the loss of a few thousands\r\na year. We are saddled with vaccination at this day, its costs\r\nand mischiefs, by reason of the vote for the National Vaccine\r\nEstablishment in 1808. As soon as an annual subsidy is placed on\r\nthe estimates, interests are created, which not only perpetuate\r\nthemselves, but constantly tend to enlargement; and such interests,\r\nonce created, can only be got rid of when proved useless by\r\nagitation out of doors and persistent pressure on the House of\r\nCommons.\r\n\r\nReferring to a notorious outbreak of smallpox among a vaccinated\r\npopulation at Ringwood in Hampshire, Cobbett continued--\r\n\r\n  I should like to have heard Mr. Rose’s statement of the\r\n  circumstances at Ringwood, whence, he says, it is evident that\r\n  the failure arose “from the use of _improper matter_.” That many\r\n  persons, who had been inoculated with Cowpox, caught Smallpox and\r\n  died at Ringwood, is a fact that even the Royal Jennerian Society\r\n  cannot deny; and this being the case, what man in his senses\r\n  will put any faith in the efficacy of Cowpox as a preventive of\r\n  Smallpox? _The thing is done._ It _has failed_, and it is vain to\r\n  endeavour to prop up its reputation; for, in a few years, it will\r\n  become proverbial as humbug.\r\n\r\nA prophecy, it will be said, that has not been fulfilled. True:\r\nbut in Cobbett’s time it advanced far to fulfilment. All the\r\nunqualified promises under which vaccination was brought into\r\npractice, were one by one surrendered under the compulsion of\r\nexperience. The mass of the people remained unvaccinated; the zeal\r\nfor vaccinating the poor abated; and the practice continued among\r\nthe middle and upper classes on the humblest pretexts--as something\r\nthat might hinder or mitigate smallpox, and in any case do little\r\nharm. We have to recollect that the mania for vaccination which\r\nnow prevails is a revival of a prescription which our forefathers\r\nhad tested and found wanting. Vaccination fell into neglect, not\r\nbecause there was indifference to smallpox, but because it did not\r\nprevent that disease.\r\n\r\nThe excuse for the first failures of vaccination was, that spurious\r\ncowpox must have been employed--spurious cowpox being the artful\r\ninvention of Jenner to cover disasters; artful, and yet absurd,\r\nfor how could cowpox exist spuriously any more than smallpox? The\r\nprecise fact, that spurious cowpox was the dodge of an unscrupulous\r\nquack was unknown to Cobbett, but he was sharp enough to recognise\r\nimposture, and thus wrote--\r\n\r\n  The pretext of _spurious matter_ is the weakest defence that ever\r\n  was set up, because it is evident that such will always be an\r\n  excuse. The Methodist pike who told his shoal of gudgeons that\r\n  _if they had faith_, they might jump into a chalk pit without so\r\n  much as spraining their ankles, answered all their reproaches\r\n  with saying, that their broken bones were owing to their own sin\r\n  in not having faith, and referred, for proof, to one among them\r\n  who had accidentally escaped unhurt. All who catch Smallpox and\r\n  die have been Cowpoxed with spurious matter, and all who have not\r\n  yet caught Smallpox, after the Cowpox operation, have had the\r\n  pure matter; and so it will be, to be sure, to the end of the\r\n  chapter.\r\n\r\n  _Who_ is to collect this genuine matter, and _whence_ is it to\r\n  come? Who shall tell whether he inoculate with Cowpox or King’s\r\n  Evil? Or with many other disorders, one of which I will not name,\r\n  but which I do hope, that fathers and mothers who have given\r\n  their children that greatest of blessing, a pure stream of blood,\r\n  will not forget when they are about to cause that blood to be\r\n  impregnated with matter taken from the ulcerous bodies of others.\r\n\r\nIn this latter warning, we have to remark Cobbett’s prescience.\r\nHe knew that it was impossible to transfer organic virus from\r\narm-to-arm without transferring more than was intended, inclusive\r\nof the dreadful disease he indicated. Vaccinators naturally\r\ndenied the possibility of such extra transmission; for if they had\r\nadmitted the possibility, they must have ceased to vaccinate. M.\r\nRicord has put the alternative plainly--\r\n\r\n  The obvious fact is, that if ever the transmission of this\r\n  disease with vaccine lymph is clearly demonstrated, _Vaccination\r\n  must be altogether discontinued_.\r\n\r\nThe clear demonstration demanded by M. Ricord has been abundantly\r\nsupplied; and what at one time was conveniently considered\r\nquestionable, is now openly confessed. Mr. Brudenell Carter,\r\nwriting in the _Medical Examiner_, 24th May, 1877, testifies--\r\n\r\n  I think that syphilitic contamination by vaccine lymph is by\r\n  no means an unusual occurrence, and that it is very generally\r\n  overlooked because people do not know either when or where to\r\n  look for it. I think that a large proportion of the cases of\r\n  apparently inherited syphilis are in reality vaccinal; and that\r\n  the syphilis in these cases does not show itself until the age of\r\n  from eight to ten years, by which time the relation between cause\r\n  and effect is apt to be lost sight of.\r\n\r\nAnd we have Sir Thomas Watson’s memorable declaration in the\r\n_Nineteenth Century_, June, 1878--\r\n\r\n  I can readily sympathise with, and even applaud, a father who,\r\n  with the presumed dread or misgiving in his mind, is willing to\r\n  submit to multiplied judicial penalties rather than expose his\r\n  child to the risk of an infection so ghastly.\r\n\r\nThus belated, thus after infinite mischief to the public health,\r\nthe Nestor of Medicine appears and solemnly allows that the warning\r\nof William Cobbett, given seventy years before, was a true warning,\r\nand that worthy of praise are the wise parents who give it heed.\r\n\r\nCobbett, grateful for escape from compulsory vaccination,\r\noverlooked, I said, the danger perpetuated through the endowment of\r\nthe practice. He was overjoyed at Canning’s emphatic declaration,\r\nthat “he could not imagine any circumstances whatever that\r\nwould induce him to follow up the most favourable report of the\r\ninfallibility of vaccination with any measure for its compulsory\r\ninfliction.” Hence he continued--\r\n\r\n  I am glad to perceive that the Ministry took care to intimate\r\n  their decided hostility to any law for propagating Cowpox by\r\n  _force_, by the aid of _pains_ and _penalties_. This being the\r\n  case, I care little about Mr. Rose and his Cowpox Institution.\r\n  Those who choose to have their children impregnated from that\r\n  shop, will be at liberty to do so; and those who wish to avoid\r\n  it, may. This is all right; though it may be very foolish for\r\n  Government to interfere in such a matter. I think we may thank\r\n  the events at Ringwood for the ministerial protest against\r\n  compulsory measures. It would have been curious enough to see\r\n  people paying penalties for being so obstinate as not to consult\r\n  their own health, or that of their children.\r\n\r\nWhat Cobbett thought would be “curious enough” we witness daily.\r\nEnglish liberty, if it has advanced in some directions, has\r\ngone back in others since Cobbett wrote. Parents are now haled\r\nbefore magistrates, fined and imprisoned, because (knowing that\r\nvaccination cannot avert smallpox, whilst it may seriously injure\r\nthe health of their children, and even cost them their lives) they\r\nrefuse to submit to the infliction. Never, perhaps, was there a\r\nmore impious invasion of liberty than compulsory vaccination, and\r\nyet we have free and enlightened Englishmen who excuse and defend\r\nit! These are the Pharisees of Liberalism, blatant over tyranny,\r\nextinct or foreign, but dull to similar tyranny within their own\r\ndomain. They garnish the sepulchres of the prophets of freedom, but\r\n(in their petty measure) repeat the deeds of those who persecuted\r\nand slew them.\r\n\r\nLastly, in the article from which I have been quoting, Cobbett\r\nassumed that the resort to the House of Commons for money was\r\nevidence that the enthusiasm for vaccination was abating. He wrote--\r\n\r\n  The present application to Parliament is a pretty good proof that\r\n  Cowpox is beginning to be _blowed upon_. The Royal Jennerian\r\n  Society _wants funds_. The subscribers have fallen off; and so\r\n  application to the public purse has become necessary. _Why_\r\n  have the subscribers fallen off? Their _humanity_ has not waxed\r\n  cold. It were slander, indeed, to suppose that. But I suspect\r\n  that their _faith_ has waxed cold; and when that is the case,\r\n  zeal soon slackens its operations, more especially when these\r\n  operations consist chiefly in the expenditure of money.\r\n\r\nThe fact was, that as vaccination failures multiplied, Jenner\r\ntried, _more suo_, to make a scape-goat of Walker, the Resident\r\nInoculator of the Royal Jennerian Society. There was a dreadful\r\nrow, and a secession of the better part of the members with Walker,\r\nwho set up the London Vaccine Institution. Those who adhered to\r\nJenner were not of the philanthropic and subscribing order, but\r\nthey had political influence, and used it to get rid of their\r\nliabilities, first in obtaining a vote of £20,000 for Jenner, and\r\nsecond in the establishment of a National Vaccine Establishment\r\nwith a subsidy of £3,000 a year.\r\n\r\nSo far Cobbett in his _Register_, where he had no occasion to\r\ndiscuss vaccination again; but toward the end of his life, 1829-30,\r\nhe produced a series of papers entitled _Advice to Young Men_, in\r\nwhich he reiterated and enforced his protest against the Jennerian\r\nimposture--\r\n\r\n  I contend [he wrote] that the beastly application could not,\r\n  in nature, be efficacious in preventing Smallpox, the truth of\r\n  which assertion has now been proved in thousands upon thousands\r\n  of instances. For a long time, for ten years, the contrary was\r\n  boldly and brazenly asserted.... But Smallpox, in its worst form,\r\n  broke out at Ringwood, and carried off, I believe (I have not the\r\n  account at hand), more than a hundred persons, young and old,\r\n  _every one of whom had had the Cowpox “so nicely.”_ And what was\r\n  then said? Was the quackery exploded? Not at all: the failure\r\n  was imputed to _unskilful operators_: to the _staleness of the\r\n  matter_: to its not being of the _genuine quality_. Admitting all\r\n  this, the scheme stood condemned; for the great advantages held\r\n  forth were, that _anybody_ might perform the operation, and that\r\n  the matter was everywhere abundant and cost free.\r\n\r\n  But these were paltry excuses: the mere shuffles of quackery;\r\n  for what do we know now? Why, that in _hundreds_ of instances,\r\n  persons Cowpoxed by JENNER HIMSELF, have taken the real Smallpox\r\n  afterwards, and have either died from the disorder or narrowly\r\n  escaped with their lives! I will mention two instances. The first\r\n  is Sir Richard Phillips, whose son, several years after Jenner\r\n  had given him the insuring matter, had a very hard struggle\r\n  for life, under the hands of the old-fashioned, seam-giving,\r\n  and dimple-dipping Smallpox. The second is Philip Codd, Esq.,\r\n  of Rumstead Court, near Maidstone, whose son had a very narrow\r\n  escape under the real Smallpox, and who also had been Cowpoxed\r\n  _by Jenner himself_. Mr. Codd I have known, and have most\r\n  sincerely respected, from the time of our both being eighteen\r\n  years of age. When the young gentleman, his son, was very young,\r\n  I, having him on my knee one day, asked his kind and excellent\r\n  mother whether he had been _inoculated_. “Oh, no!” said she, “we\r\n  are going to have him _vaccinated_.” Whereupon I, going into the\r\n  garden to the father, said, “I do hope, Codd, that you are not\r\n  going to have that beastly cow-stuff put into that fine boy.”\r\n  “Why,” said he, “you see, Cobbett, it is to be done by _Jenner\r\n  himself_.” What answer I gave, what names and epithets I bestowed\r\n  upon Jenner and his quackery, I will leave the reader to imagine.\r\n\r\n  Now, here are instances enough; but every reader has heard of,\r\n  if not seen, scores of others. Young Mr. Codd caught Smallpox at\r\n  a school; and if I recollect rightly, there were several other\r\n  vaccinated youths who did the same at the same time. Quackery,\r\n  however, has always a shuffle left. Now that Cowpox has been\r\n  proved to be no guarantee against Smallpox, it makes it _milder_\r\n  when it comes! A pretty shuffle, indeed, this! You are to be all\r\n  your life in fear of it, having as your sole consolation, that\r\n  when it comes (and it may overtake you in a camp or on the seas)\r\n  it will be milder! It was not too mild to kill at Ringwood, and\r\n  its mildness, in the case of young Mr. Codd, did not restrain it\r\n  from blinding him for a suitable number of days.\r\n\r\n  I shall not easily forget the alarm and anxiety of Mr. and Mrs.\r\n  Codd on this occasion--both of them the best of parents, and both\r\n  of them punished for having yielded to fashionable quackery. I\r\n  will not say _justly_ punished; for affection for their children,\r\n  in which respect they were never surpassed by any parents on\r\n  earth, was the cause of their listening to the danger-obviating\r\n  quackery. This, too, is the case with other parents; but parents\r\n  should be under the influence of _reason_ and _experience_, as\r\n  well as under that of affection; and _now_, at any rate, they\r\n  ought to set this really dangerous quackery at naught.\r\n\r\nSuch was Cobbett’s case against vaccination, and I ask, Was he not\r\njustified in his opposition? He saw vaccination introduced to the\r\nworld as an infallible preventive of smallpox, and he lived to\r\nsee the claim gradually minimised until reduced to that of making\r\nsmallpox milder! Even thus abated, he had to stigmatise the claim\r\nas a last shuffle of quackery. It is asserted to this day, that\r\nvaccination makes smallpox milder, but the pretence is exploded\r\nwhenever we demand, How do you know? In any case, or in any number\r\nof cases of smallpox, Who can define the severity that has been\r\nreduced by vaccination? any more than if I were to assert that\r\nvaccination intensifies smallpox, it would be impossible to confute\r\nme. We can only meet unverifiable assertion with indifference or\r\ncontempt. If it pleases people to believe in metempsychosis or the\r\nconstitution of the moon in green cheese, the wise leave them to\r\nthe enjoyment of their humour. On the other hand, I have to remark,\r\nthat smallpox is a disease of wide range of intensity, from an\r\nailment almost trivial to one invariably fatal; and this wide range\r\nof intensity was as characteristic of the disease before as since\r\nthe introduction of vaccination. On what pretext then are mild\r\ncases of smallpox attributed to the influence of vaccination? There\r\nare mild and malignant cases of smallpox alike among the vaccinated\r\nand unvaccinated, and not unfrequently when the vaccinated and\r\nunvaccinated are found in approximate conditions, as in the same\r\nhousehold, it is the unvaccinated who are most lightly afflicted,\r\nor who make the better recovery.\r\n\r\nIt often helps to a clearer apprehension of a position if we\r\nendeavour to conceive its opposite. We have seen Cobbett as\r\nan opponent of vaccination: let us try to think of him as its\r\nadvocate. Suppose he had joined with the polite and educated mob in\r\nhailing Jenner as the saviour of mankind from smallpox, and assured\r\nthe readers of the _Register_ that they would be secure from the\r\ndisease for ever if inoculated with cowpox--an easy and harmless\r\noperation. Then after a while imagine him reporting that he had\r\nbeen misled--that the operation was not so easy as represented,\r\nnor always so harmless. By and bye he would be the bearer of a\r\nmore serious revelation. Some of the vaccinated, warranted secure,\r\nhad taken smallpox, but such misadventures, he would explain, were\r\ndue to the use of a wrong sort of cowpox, of which there was a\r\nspurious variety. But the suggestion of spurious cowpox creating\r\nalarm and discouragement of vaccination, it would be necessary for\r\nhim to counteract the declaration with the avowal that by spurious\r\ncowpox was not meant spurious cowpox, but simply irregularities\r\nin the action of the genuine virus on the arms of the vaccinated.\r\nBut even these excuses would be insufficient. It was not difficult\r\nto ascribe smallpox after vaccination to careless practice, or\r\nto virus that was not the right sort of cowpox; but when smallpox\r\nwas found to occur in numerous instances after Jenner’s own\r\nvaccinations and those of the most accomplished practitioners, What\r\nwas to be said? Why, what was said, that when vaccination did not\r\nprevent smallpox, it made it milder!\r\n\r\nImagine, if we can, Cobbett’s honest and vigorous intelligence\r\nretreating through this slush of apology and prevarication! Yet\r\nthrough such slush every follower of Jenner had to trudge.\r\n\r\nI am not intent on setting Cobbett forth as a model of wisdom.\r\nI simply maintain that his common-sense was adequate to the\r\njudgment of vaccination, and that it was correctly exercised. Of\r\nphysiology and hygiene he was as ignorant as his contemporaries;\r\nbut if a lotion were sold to prevent toothache, and it did not\r\nprevent toothache, it would be safe to denounce its vendors as\r\nquacks, even though the vendors happened to be the Royal College\r\nof Physicians and the Royal College of Surgeons. The causes of\r\ndisease were unconsidered in Cobbett’s days. It was not asked why\r\npeople suffered from smallpox and other fevers, nor whether fevers\r\nwere avoidable. Such maladies were accepted like bad weather, and\r\nencountered by medical dodges, or by charms like vaccination, the\r\nmore irrational and nasty being taken for the more effective.\r\nCobbett himself, if he did not believe in vaccination, believed in\r\ninoculation with smallpox. He had his children poxed in infancy,\r\nand when he argued against vaccination, it was in the confident\r\npossession of a surer prophylactic. Taking smallpox for a probable\r\ncalamity that could only occur once in a lifetime, it seemed to him\r\nexpedient to incur the disease when convenient, and to have done\r\nwith the dread of it. How far he was mistaken in this course I need\r\nnot stay to debate. Suffice it to say, that he thought he could\r\nmake sure that smallpox was smallpox, whilst what cowpox might be\r\nnone could tell, especially after transmission through arms and\r\nconstitution unnumbered and unknown.\r\n\r\nThe causes of smallpox, I said, were unconsidered in Cobbett’s\r\ndays. It never even entered into Jenner’s head that the disease\r\nmight be a consequence of bad conditions of life; nor did he try\r\nto explain why the malady was on the decrease ere he appeared\r\nwith his magical prescription. The decrease was claimed for\r\nvaccination, but it had set in before vaccination was heard of,\r\nand was continued among those who never received it. No sanitary\r\nimprovements had been effected to account for the abatement of\r\nthe disease. To what, then, was it due? I answer, in part at\r\nleast, to a progressive change in the diet of the people--to the\r\nsubstitution of tea for malt liquors, and to the displacement of\r\narid fare by potatoes. The food of city folk up to the close of\r\nlast century was closely akin to that of men at sea, and their\r\nscorbutic habit of body was notorious--a habit that rendered acute\r\nor chronic whatever disorders they were subject to. The remedy came\r\nof inclination and necessity rather than of intention. Tea was\r\ninstinctively preferred by women, and the dearness of provisions\r\ncompelled resort to the potato, easily grown and grateful to the\r\npalate as a mitigant of the saltness of beef, bacon, and fish. If\r\nany are disposed to dispute the fact of this revolution in the\r\npopular dietary, they may be referred to Cobbett. He witnessed the\r\nchange, and persistently denounced it. Tea-drinking was to him an\r\nabomination. It was a slatternly indulgence, costly to the poor,\r\nand innutritious. Potatoes were as detestable. They were trash\r\nas compared with bread; wasteful, dirty, and unfit to satisfy a\r\nman’s appetite. It is true that tea and potatoes are poor forms of\r\nfood, but the one as a substitute for beer, and the other as an\r\nantiscorbutic, were eminently useful. It is not said that smallpox\r\nis caused or prevented by food, proper or improper, but that the\r\ncharacter of food may predispose to disease, and intensify it; as\r\nis manifest on ship-board. Hence it is (in the absence of other\r\nadequate influences) that I am disposed to ascribe the abatement\r\nof smallpox which set in toward the close of last century to\r\nthe better blood of the people ameliorated by that increased\r\nconsumption of tea and potatoes, against which Cobbett so blindly\r\nand vainly testified.\r\n\r\nA last word about Cobbett. His prejudices had nearly always a\r\ncreditable root. He hated potatoes because they were strenuously\r\nrecommended by Wilberforce and other good and goody people as cheap\r\nfood for the poor. Cobbett’s contention was, that not cheap food,\r\nbut political justice was the true remedy for popular misery. It\r\nwas very nice of Wilberforce and his friends to be kind to the\r\npoor, but, said Cobbett, if they were first just, the poor might\r\ndispense with their kindness. If the poor had their own, they might\r\nhave beer instead of tea, and bread and beef and bacon instead\r\nof potatoes, with much else besides. Cobbett was often enough in\r\nerror, but behind all his perversities lay ardent good-will for\r\nthe welfare of the greatest number of his countrymen; and the\r\nconsideration now enjoyed by the working classes is largely due to\r\nhis dauntless spirit and unwearied exertions in presence of what\r\nappeared at the time to be omnipotent opposition.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[180] _Advice to Young Men._ London, 1837. Sec. 262.\r\n\r\n[181] _Political Register_, 22nd January, 1803.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nTHE GROSVENOR CASE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be asked, Why, if Vaccination was proved useless and\r\ninjurious, was it not entirely discontinued? but the question\r\nimplies a logical consistency which is rarely exemplified in\r\nhuman experience. Vaccination was discontinued, but it was not\r\nentirely discontinued: it was chiefly continued among the upper\r\nand middle classes where fees were to be had for its performance.\r\nIt was admitted that the rite might not prevent smallpox, but it\r\nwould make it milder. The last thing a medicine man admits is,\r\nthat he is helpless and can do nothing. Even in presence of that\r\nfor which there is no remedy, it tends to his importance, and the\r\nsatisfaction of the patient, and those around the patient, to make\r\nbelieve to do something. Now for smallpox, there was no preventive.\r\nIts causes were unknown. It broke out, and it disappeared, none\r\nknew how. Jenner’s household was devastated with fever, but he\r\nnever asked, why? As observed disease was accepted like so much\r\nbad weather. Whether fevers were avoidable, or whether they\r\nwere consequences of ill living, were questions as yet outside\r\ncognizance. The predominant thought about smallpox was, that it\r\nmight be dodged, be it from God or devil. Inoculation with smallpox\r\nwas a dodge with disagreeable accompaniments: inoculation with\r\ncowpox was a dodge on easier terms: by a trick, that left every\r\nevil circumstance unaffected, smallpox was to be got rid of.\r\nIn the nature of things, the dodge was ineffective--mercifully\r\nineffective; for who that is wise would care to have the\r\nconsequences of evil abated save by the putting away of evil? The\r\ndodge proved illusory in the presence of those who recommended it,\r\nbut whilst a manifest failure as to the main intention, they had\r\nthe craft to shift its efficacy to rendering the disease milder--a\r\nclaim as to which no test was immediately available. Moreover,\r\nvaccination had the merit of action, which the quack, whether lay\r\nor professional, insists on at all hazards. To confess ignorance\r\nand inability is self-denial for which the quack’s mind is unequal,\r\nas whoever is ailing and has friends may perceive. All come bearing\r\nadvice and prescriptions for the control of nature, when, with\r\nsimple quiescence and a right disposition of circumstances, nature\r\nis instant to effect recovery.\r\n\r\nThe failures of vaccination to prevent smallpox were chiefly\r\nvisible among the poor, smallpox being predominantly an affliction\r\nof poverty; but in 1811 a case occurred in aristocratic life which\r\nproduced more talk and dismay than scores of similar cases among\r\ntrades-folk and artizans. Robert Grosvenor, son of Earl Grosvenor,\r\nvaccinated by Jenner in 1801 when a puny babe of a month old, fell\r\nill on 26th May, 1811; in a few days smallpox developed, became\r\nconfluent, and the lad narrowly escaped with life. There was no\r\nmistake about the vaccination; the mark on the boy’s arm indicated\r\n“the perfect disease”; he was attended by Sir Henry Halford and Sir\r\nWalter Farquhar, and was visited by Jenner, who happened to be in\r\ntown; and, in short, the evidence of the impotence of vaccination\r\nto avert smallpox was complete and indisputable. The commotion\r\nwas intense, and in a letter from Jenner to Baron we see how it\r\naffected his mind. He wrote--\r\n\r\n    COCKSPUR STREET, CHARING CROSS,\r\n    _11th June, 1811_.\r\n\r\n  MY DEAR FRIEND,--It will probably be my lot to be detained in\r\n  this horrible place some days longer. It has unfortunately\r\n  happened, that a failure in vaccination has appeared in the\r\n  family of a nobleman here; and, more unfortunately still, in a\r\n  child vaccinated by me. The noise and confusion this case has\r\n  created are not to be described. The vaccine lancet is sheathed;\r\n  and the long concealed variolous blade ordered to come forth.\r\n  Charming! This will soon cure the mania. The Town is a fool--an\r\n  idiot; and will continue in this red-hot--hissing-hot state\r\n  about this affair, till something else starts up to draw aside\r\n  its attention. I am determined to lock up my brains, and think\r\n  no more _pro bono publico_; and I advise you, my friend, to do\r\n  the same; for we are sure to get nothing but abuse for it. It is\r\n  my intention to collect all the cases I can of Smallpox after\r\n  supposed security from that disease. In this undertaking I hope\r\n  to derive much assistance from you. The best plan will be to\r\n  push out some of them as soon as possible. This would not be\r\n  necessary on account of the present case, but it will prove the\r\n  best shield to protect us from the past, and from those which are\r\n  to come.--Ever yours, EDWARD JENNER.[182]\r\n\r\nThe defence, therefore, was, that as an attack of smallpox did\r\nnot always avert a second attack, it was not reasonable to expect\r\nthat vaccination should be more effective; and to make good this\r\nposition, a diligent search was instituted for cases of repeated\r\nsmallpox. Many were found, though they were generally regarded\r\nas rarities, whilst their reality was frequently disputed; but\r\nwhatever their number or genuineness, they were insignificant\r\nin comparison with the instances of smallpox subsequent to\r\nvaccination. Moreover, the Jennerites were taunted with their\r\nlate discovery of smallpox after smallpox. Why had they not\r\nstated from the outset that smallpox might follow vaccination as\r\nsmallpox followed smallpox? Why, on the contrary, had they asserted\r\nvaccination to be an absolute and life-long defence against\r\nsmallpox? Why had they abused as fools or denounced as liars all\r\nthe early reporters of smallpox after vaccination? And why did it\r\nrequire evidence, that could not possibly be wriggled out of, to\r\nbring them to an acknowledgment of the truth?\r\n\r\nBut even in presence of such evidence, Jenner persisted in his\r\nasseverations as if he had lost the very sense of truth. Writing\r\nto Miss Calcraft on 19th June, 1811, he actually claimed that he\r\nhad foreseen and predicted such disasters as had occurred in the\r\nGrosvenor family! Here are his words--\r\n\r\n  Take a comprehensive view of Vaccination, and then ask yourself\r\n  what is this case? You will find it a speck, a mere microscopic\r\n  speck on the page which contains the history of the vaccine\r\n  discovery. In the very first thing I wrote upon the subject,\r\n  and many times since, I have said the occurrence of such an\r\n  event should excite no surprise; because the Cowpox must possess\r\n  preternatural powers if it would give uniform security to the\r\n  constitution, when it is well known that Smallpox cannot; for\r\n  we have more than one thousand cases to prove the contrary, and\r\n  fortunately seventeen of them in the families of the nobility.\r\n\r\nObviously had such been his uniform testimony, the Grosvenor\r\nincident would have excited neither surprise nor alarm; and mark\r\nthis additional hardihood--\r\n\r\n  Indeed, I have often said it was wonderful that I should\r\n  have gone on for such a series of years vaccinating so many\r\n  thousands, many under very unfavourable circumstances, without\r\n  meeting with any interruption to my success before. And now this\r\n  single solitary instance has occurred, all my past labours are\r\n  forgotten, and I am held up by many, perhaps the majority of the\r\n  higher classes, as an object of derision and contempt.... What if\r\n  ten, fifty, or a hundred such events should occur? they will be\r\n  balanced a hundred times over by those of a similar kind after\r\n  Smallpox.\r\n\r\nWhilst thus he maintained that it was far more extraordinary that\r\nyoung Grosvenor had smallpox after vaccination than that others\r\nshould have smallpox after smallpox, he went on to assert that\r\nvaccination had saved the lad’s life!\r\n\r\n  The child would have died (that is universally allowed) but for\r\n  the previous Vaccination. There was but little secondary fever;\r\n  the pustules were sooner in going off than in ordinary cases;\r\n  and, indeed, the whole progress of the disease was different. It\r\n  was modified and mitigated, and the boy was saved.[183]\r\n\r\nSuch was the _mot d’ ordre_. If Grosvenor had not been vaccinated,\r\nhe would have perished! The National Vaccine Board reported on the\r\ncase to the same effect, and the faithful suffered themselves to be\r\nre-assured.\r\n\r\nIn connection with 1811 and London smallpox, there is a letter to\r\nDr. Lettsom which throws still farther light on Jenner’s temper and\r\nphilosophy. He wrote--\r\n\r\n    CHELTENHAM, _22nd November, 1811_.\r\n\r\n  I have considered London as the centre of opposition to the\r\n  vaccine practice; but even there, in spite of the base and\r\n  murderous designs of a few bad minded individuals, the Smallpox\r\n  has wonderfully decreased; and in the provinces its mortality\r\n  has lessened in a still greater proportion. For the great and\r\n  grand effects of Vaccination the eye must quit this little\r\n  spot, and survey it among other European countries, and still\r\n  more particularly among the vast empires of Asia and America.\r\n  In Mexico and Peru the disease is nearly extinct. The documents\r\n  which pour in upon me from these distant regions fill me with\r\n  inexpressible delight. You shall have copies when I can get them\r\n  transcribed.\r\n\r\n  The chief impediments to the general adoption of Vaccination\r\n  in England are, I am confident, our newspapers and some of our\r\n  magazines. Whenever a case of what is called failure starts up,\r\n  in it goes to a newspaper, with all the exaggeration with which\r\n  envy and malice can garnish it.[184]\r\n\r\nWas there ever a more delicious bit of self-revelation! The\r\nwicked newspapers! The base, murderous and bad minded enemies\r\nof vaccination! The smallpox of London reduced by vicarious\r\nvaccination in spite of its ingratitude! The consolation derived\r\nfrom the survey of the countries of Europe and the vast empires of\r\nAsia and America with inexpressible delight from Mexico and Peru!\r\nNot Mrs. Jellyby herself lost in an atmosphere of Borrioboola-Gah\r\nis more piquant.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[182] Baron’s _Life of Jenner_, vol. ii. p. 161.\r\n\r\n[183] Baron’s _Life of Jenner_, vol. ii. p. 158.\r\n\r\n[184] Pettigrew’s _Memoirs of J.

JOHN WALKER.\r\n\r\n\r\nJenner’s references to the good effects of vaccination in London\r\nwere curiously inconsistent. That vaccination in which he professed\r\nto rejoice was chiefly the work of Dr. John Walker, whose practice\r\nhe had denounced as so widely at variance with what he considered\r\ncorrect, that even the wreck of the Royal Jennerian Society was not\r\nthought too heavy a price to pay for deliverance from complicity\r\nwith him. The London Vaccine Institution, established in 1806 by\r\nWalker and his friends, was responsible for the large majority\r\nof vaccinations effected in the metropolis. Walker was a pure\r\nenthusiast, of boundless energy, with a craze for vaccinating.\r\nAdverse results had no effect upon him: he did not deny, but simply\r\ndid not recognise them, and held on prophesying and practising with\r\nmechanical persistency. Nevertheless, he ran aground. The income of\r\nthe Institution had dwindled to less than £100 a year when Andrew\r\nJohnstone, a Cumberland man, a school-fellow of Walker, came to\r\nhis assistance. With a commercial eye he surveyed the situation.\r\nHe perceived that though vaccination had fallen into disrepute,\r\nthere remained many believers who only required stirring up and\r\nsolicitation to provide funds to keep Walker going and to yield\r\nthe collector a satisfactory commission. As the Royal Jennerian\r\nSociety had ceased to exist for any active purpose in 1810, nothing\r\nremaining “but a Patronage, a Presidency, and an unorganised body\r\nof Subscribers and Governors,” it occurred to him that it would be\r\ngood policy to annex these to the revived enterprise, and in due\r\ncourse a union was effected, and the LONDON VACCINE INSTITUTION\r\nAND ROYAL JENNERIAN SOCIETY became the title to conjure with. An\r\nattempt was made to secure Jenner for President, but that was too\r\nbold a stroke. He thus answered the application--\r\n\r\n    CHELTENHAM, _3rd September, 1813_.\r\n\r\n  Although it must be evident that every institution which has for\r\n  its object the extension of Vaccine Inoculation, must have my\r\n  best wishes for its success, yet, for reasons which on reflection\r\n  must be obvious, you must see the impossibility of my accepting\r\n  the offered appointment.\r\n\r\nHighly impressive were the Reports of the reconstituted Institution\r\nunder the patronage of the Corporation of the City of London with\r\nthe City Arms on the covers. Subsequently the King, George IV.,\r\nappeared as patron, and the City Arms gave place to the Royal Arms.\r\nAmong the presidents were the Archbishop of Canterbury, four or\r\nfive Dukes (one of them Wellington), half a dozen Marquises and as\r\nmany Bishops, about a score of Earls, with M.P.’s and pious and\r\nphilanthropic notables many. So much was due to the tact of Andrew\r\nJohnstone, who understood the use of names, who never dropped one\r\nof the least influence, and, spite of Jenner’s ill-will, dealt\r\nwith his honours and countenance as though they belonged to the\r\nInstitution. Business is business, he would have said, and holds\r\nno reckoning with pique and dislike. Nevertheless the financial\r\nresults did not correspond with the overpowering patronage. The\r\nincome of the Institution never attained £1000 a year, whilst the\r\nbills for advertising and printing sometimes approached £500. In\r\nthe Report for 1827 we find the operations thus summarised--\r\n\r\n    Vaccinated during 1826 by Dr. Walker,                4,217\r\n    From the beginning, 1803,                           65,750\r\n    By appointed Inoculators in London and environs\r\n      in 1826,                                          16,999\r\n    From the beginning,                                237,119\r\n    By appointed Inoculators in the country in 1826,    21,261\r\n    From the beginning,                                548,430\r\n\r\nThe income of the Institution in 1826 was £620 15s., and the\r\nexpenditure £715 12s., leaving a deficit of £94 17s.\r\n\r\nThe figures are interesting, for they afford some idea of the\r\nextent of London vaccination during a quarter of a century. The\r\noperations of the Vaccine Institution lay chiefly among the\r\npoor--the vast majority in London as in every city; and if we\r\nallow that in the course of five-and-twenty years, 350,000, in\r\na population of upwards of 1,000,000 in the flux of life and\r\ndeath, were operated on, we give a liberal estimate in favour\r\nof vaccination. That even so many could have much effect on the\r\nprevalence of smallpox (except for aggravation) is incredible,\r\nunless the vicarious action of vaccination be seriously asserted.\r\nTurning over Walker’s report it is amusing to observe how any\r\nabatement in London smallpox was attributed to vaccination, and any\r\nincrease to its neglect--an ingenuous exemplification of the fable\r\nof the Fly and the Wheel.\r\n\r\nThe appointed inoculators of the Institution were a numerous\r\nbody--250 names and addresses are given in one of the Reports. They\r\nwere chiefly London tradesmen with a taste for doing what they\r\nthought “good.” As vaccination came to be regarded as professional\r\nwork, these “unqualified practitioners” gave cause for offence,\r\nbut Walker held stoutly to his opinion, which he shared with\r\nJenner, that vaccination might be performed by any man or woman.\r\nIn Walker’s words, “It is easier to perform the whole business of\r\nvaccination than it is to thread a needle--yea, it is easier.”\r\n\r\nThe annexation of the remains of the Royal Jennerian Society by\r\nWalker was much disliked by Jenner and his associates; and when\r\nthe revived enterprise showed signs of prosperity, their dislike\r\ndeveloped to open enmity, and John Ring’s services as bravo and\r\nsatirist were called into requisition. He first tried his hand,\r\nanonymously, in a volume of doggerel, published in 1815, entitled\r\n_The Vaccine Scourge_,[185] in which Walker is represented as\r\nsinging--\r\n\r\n      I am a jolly beggar,\r\n        From Cockermouth I came;\r\n      I do pretend to be a Friend,\r\n        John Walker is my name;\r\n      And a-begging we will go, will go, will go,\r\n      And a-begging we will go.\r\n\r\nThe verses, extending over a hundred pages, are wretched stuff,\r\nvulgar and malevolent, and a few extracts from the Preface will\r\nindicate the animus of the entire performance. Ring’s assumption\r\nwas, first, that Walker was a rogue from whom the public required\r\nto be protected; second, that his Institution was superfluous; and\r\nthird, that if greater facilities for vaccination were wanted in\r\nLondon, it should be left to the Government to provide them--\r\n\r\n  These hints may serve to warn the public. Dr. Walker is an\r\n  artful, avaricious, and ambitious man; but let him be cautious\r\n  how he acts when he tries to exercise his art, to glut his\r\n  avarice, and to gratify his ambition. Let him recollect what was\r\n  inscribed on the tombstone of an infamous scoundrel--\r\n\r\n      “Lie still if you’re wise;\r\n      You’ll be damned if you rise.”\r\n\r\n  We recommend him and his accomplices not to try to obtain\r\n  money by false pretences. A Vaccine Institution has long been\r\n  established by the Legislature, where, as well as at other\r\n  Institutions, matter may be procured free of expense; and no one\r\n  who has much zeal in the cause of Vaccination will find much\r\n  difficulty in procuring it. If farther aid is necessary, let it\r\n  be granted by Parliament, and not to a set of swindlers. It is\r\n  not meet to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.\r\n\r\nMany of the agents of the London Vaccine Institution were chemists\r\nand apothecaries, and these, according to Ring, had an interest in\r\nthe propagation of smallpox--\r\n\r\n  To exterminate Smallpox by means of chemists and apothecaries,\r\n  the greatest friends of Smallpox, is to cast out devils by\r\n  Beelzebub, the prince of the devils. You might as well expect\r\n  a foxhunter to destroy the breed of foxes, or a ratcatcher to\r\n  exterminate the race of rats.\r\n\r\nThe _Vaccine Scourge_ producing little effect, Ring returned to\r\nthe charge in the following year, 1816, with _A Caution against\r\nVaccine Swindlers and Imposters_.[186] The _Caution_ is a series\r\nof libels, the puerility and extravagance of which were their own\r\nnullification. A motto was taken from the _New Monthly Magazine_\r\nfor the title-page, as follows--\r\n\r\n  The Jennerian discovery has shed a brilliant lustre on our era;\r\n  but unfortunately, the discovery has been in a great degree\r\n  rendered abortive by _bastard institutions_, created for the\r\n  purpose of filling the pockets of _a set of adventurers, without\r\n  education_, and _destitute of principle_. We could name several\r\n  wretches who have fattened, and are still fattening, on such jobs.\r\n\r\nRing delivered his mind unequivocally. Walker was an imposter, and\r\nthe London Vaccine Institution prospered by his frauds--\r\n\r\n  There is a Society in this Metropolis [he wrote], falsely calling\r\n  itself the Royal Jennerian Society, which has been collecting\r\n  subscriptions to a considerable amount under that assumed name;\r\n  and thus collecting money under false pretences.\r\n\r\n  An eminent physician speaking of this Society and its successful\r\n  state, called it a successful villany; and villany is not the\r\n  less villany because it is successful.\r\n\r\n  It has also been organising a complete system of quackery, by\r\n  granting diplomas to persons totally ignorant of the first\r\n  principles of the medical profession, which will add to the\r\n  present host of empirics.\r\n\r\n  No one can now pass along the streets without being annoyed with\r\n  the inscription, VACCINATION GRATIS UNDER THE SANCTION OF THE\r\n  LONDON VACCINE INSTITUTION in one pane of glass, MACASSAR OIL in\r\n  a second, and PATENT BLACKING in a third. In short Vaccination is\r\n  now _quite a drug_.\r\n\r\nThese were words of envy and malice, and came with odious\r\ninconsistency from the spokesman of Jenner, who had instructed\r\nand encouraged his acquaintances, male and female, to practise\r\nvaccination. We may, however, take Ring’s evidence as to Walker’s\r\nactivity in London--\r\n\r\n  Dr. Walker glories in his chemical, galenical, pharmaceutical,\r\n  and dentrifical inoculators; and boasts that they exceed in\r\n  number those of any other vaccine institution; but he glories in\r\n  his shame. _Non numerentur, sed ponderentur._ They are springing\r\n  up under every pestle and mortar, and barber’s pole, like\r\n  mushrooms in a hot-bed, from Hyde-Park Corner to Whitechapel, and\r\n  from Whitechapel to Blackwall. It is the duty of every regular\r\n  practitioner to expose such imposters, and to encourage such\r\n  exposure. It is, in fact, the rescuing of life from fraudulent\r\n  and rapacious hands.\r\n\r\n  One of his inoculators is Mr. Campbell, who cures all sorts of\r\n  incurable diseases with _Elephants’ Milk_. He says he recently\r\n  sent 20,000 bottles to Russia at 11s. each. He also sells the\r\n  Milk in pills at 2s. 9d. a box. The poor have the Milk at\r\n  half-price; and strict secresy is preserved.\r\n\r\n  In Walker’s Plan for 1814, it appears that he grants his diplomas\r\n  to those who _are not_, as well as to those who _are_, of the\r\n  medical profession, and that Inoculators in the country are\r\n  requested and _authorised_ to put up a board with the following\r\n  inscription, PROTECTION FROM SMALLPOX UNDER THE SANCTION OF\r\n  THE LONDON VACCINE INSTITUTION. Then is to follow the name\r\n  of the farrier, cobbler, barber, barber-surgeon, apothecary,\r\n  man-midwife, tooth-drawer, druggist, chemist, oil-man,\r\n  cheesemonger, drysalter, or grocer, who dispenses the blessing of\r\n  Vaccination gratuitously.\r\n\r\n  The motley crew thus appointed are directed to make an Annual\r\n  Return of the numbers inoculated by them in order to swell Dr.\r\n  Walker’s list; and such inoculators are not in general very nice\r\n  in their calculations. Many of them will, in all probability,\r\n  like other quacks, pretend to a hundred times more than they\r\n  really perform.\r\n\r\nThose who continued to believe that Vaccination was an easy and\r\nharmless operation, could see nothing but good management in the\r\nmultiplication of Walker’s agencies, nor anything but meanness\r\nin Ring’s sneers at tradesmen. His assertion that the use of\r\nthe title of the Royal Jennerian Society was fraudulent, had no\r\njustification, yet it was his persistent reproach--\r\n\r\n  Honesty is the best policy. I therefore sincerely advise Dr.\r\n  Walker and his Board, to assume no more the title of the Royal\r\n  Jennerian Society, to which they must know they have not the\r\n  least claim, lest they should be brought before the Lord Mayor\r\n  as swindlers, and be prosecuted for obtaining money under false\r\n  pretences. I am informed that they have already been compelled\r\n  to refund a legacy of £100; and it is to be hoped they will be\r\n  compelled to refund the rest of their ill-gotten store.\r\n\r\nLastly, he appealed to the members of the Jennerian Society,\r\ndemanding--\r\n\r\n  How long will they suffer their names to be prostituted, and the\r\n  public to be deluded by a set of swindlers and imposters; by\r\n  men who are neither dignified by their rank, nor distinguished\r\n  by their talents; by a set of daring adventurers and despicable\r\n  upstarts! It is a gross insult and indignity, to which no man of\r\n  the least sense of honour, or of shame, would submit.\r\n\r\nBut they did submit, and why not? Enthusiasm for Vaccination had\r\npassed away. It had been found out; it was everywhere distrusted;\r\nand those who held by it had to see it pushed on the same terms as\r\nany other quack prescription. What then was there to object to in\r\nWalker s procedure? The reason for Ring’s libels lay in Jenner’s\r\njealousy. Walker was Jenner’s abhorrence. He had joined in the\r\nconspiracy to oust Walker from the Jennerian Society in 1806, but\r\nthe operation proved fatal to the Society, whilst Walker conveyed\r\nthe confidence and subscriptions of the faithful to his new\r\nInstitution. What wonder, then, that Jenner disliked the eccentric\r\nQuaker! Even worse; Walker accurately appraised Jenner’s share in\r\n“the vaccine discovery,” which came, he said, from Jenner as a\r\nhint, and was developed by Pearson and Woodville in practice--a\r\nfact that was as gall and wormwood to Jenner. Moreover, Walker\r\nhad written a Jenneric Opera in which Jenner was represented as a\r\ncountry apothecary riding up to London on a cow, and going round\r\na-begging among the nobility and gentry. Wherefore says Ring--\r\n\r\n  As to the calumny and detraction which Dr. Jenner and his friends\r\n  have received at the hands of that desperate adventurer in his\r\n  Jenneric Opera and elsewhere, they are content to bear it,\r\n  provided he will not again use the language of flattery toward\r\n  them; nor lavish his encomiums on them in that polluted channel,\r\n  the Medical Journal. His resentment can do very little harm,\r\n  which is more than can be said of his adulation.\r\n\r\n      “It is the slaver kills, and not the bite!”\r\n\r\nRing was an awkward champion. He sneered at Walker’s diplomas\r\ncertifying fitness to act as vaccinator--\r\n\r\n  They will have the same authority [he said] and the same virtue\r\n  as a diploma from the University of St. Andrews; and in all\r\n  probability will in a short time be sold at the same price--\r\n\r\nForgetful that it was from St. Andrews that Jenner purchased his\r\nM.D.!\r\n\r\nWith equal recklessness, he denounced Walker as a vaccinator,\r\nsaying--\r\n\r\n  He tells the public in his Address that “Vaccination will shed\r\n  consolation into the bosom of every family;” but alas! I have\r\n  known many a family that has had reason to rue the day in which\r\n  they believed him, when he told them this flattering tale....\r\n  It is very necessary that his followers pray that the Lord have\r\n  mercy on them, if they have no other director than Dr. Walker.\r\n\r\nConcerning the consequences of Walker’s operations, Ring, no\r\ndoubt, testified truly. Many continue to rue the day when they\r\nlisten to the flattering tale of the vaccinator. But the testimony\r\ncame strangely from a Jennerite, who was ready to swear that\r\nany abatement of smallpox in London was due to the vaccinations\r\neffected in great part by “that desperate adventurer,” Walker!\r\n\r\nRing was implacable, the more so, perhaps, as Walker and his\r\nfriends were apparently indifferent to his abuse. He burst forth\r\nafresh in the _London Medical Repository_ for 1821, where among\r\nmuch else we find the following--\r\n\r\n    HANOVER STREET, _11th October, 1821_.\r\n\r\n  The mock Royal Jennerian Society is extending its impositions and\r\n  depredations. The emissaries of this bastard institution, as well\r\n  as the principals, should suffer transportation if there be any\r\n  public spirit among us.\r\n\r\n  I beg leave to add that the present Society is disclaimed by Dr.\r\n  Jenner, who cautioned the Emperor of Russia against it when his\r\n  Majesty was in London in 1814.\r\n\r\n  In my _Caution against Vaccine Swindlers and Imposters_,\r\n  published in 1816, I related several instances of the ill effects\r\n  of Dr. Walker’s practice, and some in which it had proved\r\n  fatal. It was partly for his mal-practice, and partly for his\r\n  mis-conduct, that he was about to be expelled from the Royal\r\n  Jennerian Society; and, after his artful and wicked stratagems,\r\n  was permitted to resign; yet now he has the arrogance to call\r\n  himself Director of that Society, and to issue his venal diplomas\r\n  in its name. If Dr. Walker must imitate the universities of St.\r\n  Andrews and Aberdeen, let him at least have like them _some_\r\n  certificate of qualification. If he is determined _to grow rich\r\n  by degrees_, let him also endeavour to grow wise and honest.\r\n\r\nThe diplomas which thus moved Ring’s wrath were imposing documents,\r\ncertifying that the holder was authorised to vaccinate, intended to\r\nbe framed and exhibited in the shop or parlour. There was a picture\r\nof something like an arch of Waterloo Bridge with London in the\r\nbackground and the Royal Arms overhead; Jenner standing on a pier\r\nwith a dead serpent hanging in limp folds over his arm, with the\r\ninscription, _Per omnia littora vincitur variola_; a woman milking\r\na cow with a group of children around her, drinking milk out of\r\nporringers, as if milk were cowpox; whilst the bed of the Thames\r\nwas blocked with the names of the great and good who had testified\r\nin favour of vaccination--an allegorical style of representation\r\nthen much in vogue and considered impressive.\r\n\r\nIn order to create prejudice, Ring had much to say of Walker’s\r\nreligious and political principles. He was a Quaker of the Thomas\r\nPaine pattern, and like Paine had associated with the French\r\nrevolutionists; but whilst dressing as a Friend, and associating\r\nwith Friends, he was too unconformable a personality for their\r\nSociety, and was never received into membership. Ring’s imputations\r\nof rapacity and avarice were grossly absurd as applied to Walker.\r\nHe cared for nothing beyond support in his work as vaccinator. It\r\nwas said he would take a £5 note, fold it, stick a pin through\r\nit, write an address on the back, and post it. He would rarely\r\nvaccinate the well-to-do. If they came to his office, he would\r\nask, “Who is thy medical attendant?” and wrapping up some fresh\r\nmatter on glasses would say, “Take this with my compliments to\r\nthy medical attendant, and he will do what is requisite quite as\r\nwell as myself.” When he did call at a house to vaccinate, he\r\nnever asked for a fee, and his biographer, Dr. Epps,[187] observes\r\nthat he was only known on one occasion to express a wish for\r\nremuneration. Meeting a merchant in St. Paul’s Churchyard, whose\r\nhousehold he had vaccinated at some inconvenience, he observed,\r\n“Friend, if thou has sent by thy servant a draft for my services to\r\nthy family, he has either robbed me or deceived thee.” When money\r\nwas brought to him, he usually called his wife to receive it, she\r\nhaving the undivided care of all that pertained to him apart from\r\nvaccination. Of this good woman, Annie, he was in the habit of\r\nspeaking with an admiration and unreserve that constituted one of\r\nhis numerous oddities. For example, when Dr. Moore in his _History\r\nof Vaccination_ observed somewhat maliciously--\r\n\r\n  John Walker, it is said, procured a medical diploma from the\r\n  indulgent University of Leyden; and more excellent work than\r\n  Walker’s has rarely been performed by a humbler instrument--\r\n\r\nWalker good-humouredly replied, that Moore as a Glasgow man\r\nnaturally preferred his own University to that of Leyden, but he\r\ntoo had cause to love Glasgow--\r\n\r\n      “Glasgow is a bonnie town, and there are bonnie lasses in it.”\r\n\r\n  There is not any other spot on the surface of the globe where\r\n  I have experienced a happiness so complete as I obtained in it\r\n  in 1799. Let any bachelor who cannot divine what this assertion\r\n  may mean, be informed, that it was then and there I entered into\r\n  marriage; and the covenant was ratified in the office of the\r\n  Clerk of the Peace for the county of Lanarkshire.[188]\r\n\r\nWalker was obstinate, but not vindictive. Dr. James Sims offered\r\nhim £1000 in 1806 to prosecute his adversaries for conspiracy,\r\nbut he left them to their devices, and proved his quality by\r\noutworking and superseding them. He replied to Moore’s flippant\r\nversion of the causes that led to the division and destruction of\r\nthe Royal Jennerian Society with perfect self-control and manifest\r\ntruthfulness, but at the same time with a simplicity not of this\r\nworld.[189] Jenner’s spite, Ring’s abuse, and the sneers of the\r\nsuperfine did him little harm; and, if vaccination were beneficial,\r\nI should have nothing but praise for the good people, who,\r\nrecognising the sincerity of his work, disregarded trivialities of\r\nmanner, and supported him loyally as a faithful servant.\r\n\r\nWalker was nothing but a vaccinator. Day after day, in rain or\r\nsunshine, his lank figure, and self-complacent visage under a\r\nwhite broad-brimmed hat were to be seen making the round of the\r\nvaccine stations. When he entered a room, he first glanced at the\r\ntable on which he expected to find his books. If any mothers had\r\nplaced their children’s bonnets or garments thereon, they were at\r\nonce swept off. He then ranged the company in order against the\r\nwall like a schoolmaster, and delivered a short address on the\r\nprotection he was about to confer. The children’s names were taken\r\ndown with a preliminary caution to speak distinctly. When women\r\nmuttered or gabbled, the Doctor grew irritable, and would sometimes\r\nmake a troublesome woman spell her infant’s name half-a-dozen\r\ntimes, adding, “Now thou wilt know how to speak plainly.” Having\r\ngot the names, he had next to look out for virus. The few mothers\r\nwho had ventured to return with their vaccinated babes for\r\nexamination, would perhaps lose courage and attempt to escape, when\r\nWalker would dart to the door and arrest the fugitive, saying,\r\n“Thou foolish woman! If thou wilt not do good to others, I will\r\nbless thy little one,” and would proceed to gather what he called\r\nhis “Vaccine Roses.” He pursued his operations calmly indifferent\r\nto the screams of the children and the complaints of the\r\nmothers, and as he disposed of each case pronounced the illusory\r\nbenediction, “Thy child is safe: fear not: fare thee well.”\r\n\r\nWalker died in 1830, aged seventy-one, after a short illness, in\r\nwhich “he refused to take any medicine though himself a physician.”\r\nIn the Report of the London Vaccine Institution for 1831 we read--\r\n\r\n  He was a man who day after day, month after month, and year after\r\n  year, watched with the care of a parent the cause of which he\r\n  was so experienced an advocate; who was willing to know nothing\r\n  but the object of his early love, Vaccination; who for upwards\r\n  of a quarter of a century never omitted one lawful day going his\r\n  rounds to the numerous stations of the Institution; and who, it\r\n  may be almost said, ended his life with the lancet in his hand,\r\n  for he went round to the stations two days before he died.\r\n\r\nToward the end of his life, he used to boast that he had performed\r\nupwards of one hundred thousand vaccinations. So far as vaccination\r\nprevailed in London, it was chiefly through Walker’s exertions; and\r\nhe was just the character, being set going, to keep going whatever\r\nthe adverse evidence or obloquy. He had his plans and his methods,\r\nand those who tried to modify them took nothing by their pains.\r\nHe was a man to have his own way, and those who did not like him\r\nmight leave him. Whether from incapacity or affectation, he made no\r\nattempt at politeness, and said precisely what he thought without\r\naccommodation. He was a piece of mechanism rather than of genial\r\nhumanity.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[185] _The Vaccine Scourge containing the New Beggar’s Opera_ alias\r\n_the Walkerian Farce_, alias _the London Vaccine Hoax; in answer to\r\nDr. Walker’s Jenneric Opera.

His position was one of much difficulty, and its\r\npeculiarity is rarely, if ever, recognised. For example, how few\r\nknow that his _Inquiry_ published in 1798, “that master-piece of\r\nmedical induction,” according to Mr. John Simon, was kept out of\r\nprint and referred to as rarely as possible after 1801-2.\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\nThe answer to the question is so important that at the risk of\r\nrepetition I give it explicitly.\r\n\r\nThe _Inquiry_ was suppressed because of its ascription of cowpox to\r\nhorsegrease.\r\n\r\nIt was the belief of dairy-maids in Gloucestershire that to\r\nhave had cowpox was to be secure from smallpox. Jenner was\r\nmuch impressed by the rustic superstition, and brought it so\r\npersistently before his medical brethren at their convivial\r\nassemblies, that they threatened to expel him if he bored them any\r\nlonger with the subject. “It is true,” they said, “that the maids\r\nbelieve an attack of cowpox keeps off smallpox, but we know they\r\nare wrong; for we are all familiar with cases of smallpox after\r\ncowpox.”\r\n\r\nThus frustrated, Jenner’s ingenuity took another turn. It was the\r\nbelief of farriers that if infected in dressing horses’ greasy\r\nheels, they too were secure from smallpox. The area of this\r\nconviction was narrower than that of the dairy-maids, farriers\r\nbeing neither so numerous, nor so observant of their beauty: but\r\nJenner entertained their faith and converted it to his purpose.\r\n\r\nHorsegrease protected from smallpox, if cowpox did not. But might\r\nthere not be one sort of cowpox that answered to the dairy-maids’\r\nfaith, if another sort did not? Happy thought! The defensive sort\r\nwas derived from the horsegrease which protected the farriers: the\r\nnon-defensive originated spontaneously on the cows. Men, fresh from\r\nhandling horses’ greasy heels, milked cows and communicated to them\r\nthe horses’ disease. Milkmaids, who in turn contracted from the\r\ncows that sort of pox, were like the farriers secure from smallpox,\r\nyea securer; whilst milkmaids who contracted pox spontaneously\r\ndeveloped on cows were not secure. The milkmaids’ superstition was\r\ntherefore justifiable: they were right and they were wrong--right\r\nwhen they got pox through the cow from the horse; wrong when they\r\ngot pox from the cow simply.\r\n\r\nWhy then, it may be asked, did not Jenner dismiss the cow from\r\nconsideration? Why did he not base his prescription on the\r\nfarriers’ experience, and use and recommend horsegrease exclusively\r\nfor inoculation? The question is an obvious one, but it is not easy\r\nto make out Jenner’s answer with precision. His assertion was,\r\nthat--\r\n\r\n  The virus from the horse is not to be relied upon as rendering\r\n  the system secure from variolous infection, but the matter\r\n  produced by it on the nipple of the cow is perfectly so--\r\n\r\nwhich was to say that horsegrease attained its highest prophylaxy\r\nafter transmission through the cow.\r\n\r\nSuch was the doctrine of the _Inquiry_, “that master-piece of\r\nmedical induction.”\r\n\r\nWhen the doctrine came to be reduced to practice, difficulties\r\narose. Cowpox was considered wholesome and credible, whilst\r\nhorsegrease was repulsive and incredible. Still fact was fact; and\r\nmany were ready to accept horsegrease through the cow, or without\r\nthe cow, if such indeed were the source of the new salvation.\r\nCowpox proved to be a rare commodity, whilst horsegrease was\r\ncommon, and numerous attempts were made to produce cowpox by means\r\nof grease, but ineffectually. At some attempts, Jenner officiated.\r\nMarshall records that--\r\n\r\n  Mr. Sewell, Assistant Professor at the Royal Veterinary College,\r\n  informs me that he was a witness to a series of experiments,\r\n  twice repeated, at the College in the presence of Dr. Jenner,\r\n  Dr. Woodville, Mr. Wachsel, and Mr. Turner, with a view to\r\n  produce the vaccine disease on the teats of a cow. The matter of\r\n  grease had been immediately taken from the horse, and variously\r\n  applied by long continued friction, punctures, scarifications,\r\n  and by scratching the surface with a needle; but from these\r\n  trials neither inflammation, nor any affection resembling a pock\r\n  resulted.[190]\r\n\r\nTo this discomfiture Jenner had to submit. His ascription of\r\ncowpox to horsegrease was stigmatised as an error of which the\r\nless that was said the better. It is true that other experimenters\r\nwere more successful, and that Loy of Whitby and Sacco of Milan\r\ndispensed with the cow as a superfluity and used matter direct\r\nfrom the horse for inoculation, passing the virus from arm to\r\narm into general circulation until what was equine was lost\r\nsight of and indistinguishable from what was vaccine; but Jenner\r\ndid not care to be justified at the risk of his popularity and\r\nthe money on which he had set his heart. He saw how the wind of\r\npublic favour was blowing, and went with it. Since horsegrease\r\nwas disliked, he consented to its oblivion. Pearson, the chief\r\npromoter and organiser of vaccination, scoffed at horsegrease,\r\nand used spontaneous cowpox, which Jenner knew was of no avail\r\nagainst smallpox; but he entered no protest upon that score. On the\r\ncontrary, he let the futile practice go on; he claimed it as his\r\nown; and he set about manufacturing excuses for the failures which\r\nwere imminent.\r\n\r\nSpurious cowpox was one of the most dexterous of these excuses.\r\nIf injury or smallpox followed vaccination, the disaster was\r\nascribed to spurious cowpox. Jenner’s _Further Observations_,\r\npublished in 1799, was designed to teach “how to distinguish with\r\naccuracy between that peculiar pustule which is the _true_ Cow\r\nPock and that which is _spurious_;” and in his _Origin of the\r\nVaccine Inoculation_ in 1801 even greater stress was laid on the\r\ndistinction. By and bye, however, the excuse worked more harm than\r\nadvantage. People got terrified with the mischiefs ascribed to\r\nspurious cowpox, and as which was genuine and which spurious was\r\nonly discoverable in their consequences, they began to decline to\r\nhave either. It then became expedient to deny spurious cowpox,\r\nwhich Jenner did. He confessed to the Royal College of Physicians\r\nthat there was not a true and a false cowpox; and that by spurious\r\ncowpox he “meant nothing more than to express irregularity in the\r\nform and progress of the vaccine pustule from which its efficacy is\r\ninferred.”\r\n\r\nIn view of facts like these, there is little cause for surprise\r\nthat the publication of Jenner’s _Inquiry_ with its two supplements\r\nwas not continued. What he set forth as essential was treated\r\nas illusory, whilst the cowpox in which he had taught there was\r\nno security had been brought into use everywhere. Why therefore\r\nembarrass himself with proclamations of his own blunders? The\r\nbelievers in vaccination were good-natured and incurious, and he\r\nhad their homage, which was agreeable and profitable, and why\r\nshould he dissipate it? The _Inquiry_ was printed for the third\r\ntime in 1801, but “this master-piece of medical induction” has\r\nnever been republished; and the probability is, that if ever\r\nreproduced, it will be to prove to the world the emptiness of its\r\nauthor’s pretensions.\r\n\r\nJenner’s original promises of immunity from smallpox by inoculation\r\nwith horsegrease cowpox were absolute. Thus he wrote--\r\n\r\n  The person who has been affected with Cowpox Virus is for ever\r\n  after secure from the infection of the Smallpox.[191]\r\n\r\n  It clearly appears that this disease, Cowpox, leaves the\r\n  constitution in a state of perfect security from the infection of\r\n  the Smallpox.[192]\r\n\r\n  Cowpox admits of being inoculated on the human frame with\r\n  the most perfect ease and safety, and is attended with the\r\n  singularly beneficial effect of rendering through life the\r\n  person so inoculated perfectly secure from the infection of the\r\n  Smallpox.[193]\r\n\r\nExperience was not slow to demonstrate the futility of these\r\nassurances. At first the facts were flatly denied: it was\r\nimpossible for smallpox to succeed cowpox. The evidence, however,\r\ngrew too strong to be outsworn, and then it was said the cowpox\r\nmust have been spurious. As failures accumulated over the\r\noperations of Jenner himself and his choice disciples (who were\r\nnaturally presumed to know and avoid spurious cowpox) they began\r\nto lay great stress on the fact that smallpox itself did not\r\nalways avert a subsequent attack; and if smallpox did not save\r\nfrom smallpox, why, they demanded, should cowpox be expected to do\r\nmore?[194] Why, indeed! Still the cases of smallpox after cowpox\r\nwere as scores to those of smallpox after smallpox, and then the\r\nargument was reduced to a competition between variolation and\r\nvaccination. “You inoculators with smallpox,” said the vaccinators,\r\n“are continually having smallpox after variolation, and why should\r\nwe be expected to be more successful?” Why, indeed! The inoculators\r\nwith smallpox in turn denied that after efficient variolation\r\nsmallpox ever occurred, or could possibly occur; and thus the\r\nwrangle went on. One thing was plain and certain--the original\r\nclaim of Jenner for the absolute infallibility of Horsegrease\r\nCowpox as a preventive of Smallpox was reduced and surrendered bit\r\nby bit until it came to this at last--it made Smallpox milder!\r\n\r\nThese repeated surrenders were, however, never ingenuous. Mistakes\r\nare inevitable, and they are forgiven when frankly confessed; but\r\nfrank confession was not Jenner’s habit. When vaccination failures\r\nhad become notorious in 1808, he had the hardihood to assert, that\r\nfrom the outset he had recognised that as smallpox did not always\r\navert smallpox, neither did he expect cowpox to do so; and cited as\r\nproof of his prescience this passage from _Further Observations_ in\r\n1799--\r\n\r\n  It should be remembered that the constitution cannot, by previous\r\n  infection, be rendered _totally_ insusceptible of the variolous\r\n  poison; neither the casual, nor the inoculated Smallpox, whether\r\n  it produce the disease in a mild or violent way, can _perfectly_\r\n  extinguish the susceptibility.[195]\r\n\r\nHere Jenner made a bold draft on his reader’s ignorance. It was\r\nhis claim for horsegrease cowpox that it conferred an absolute\r\nsecurity from smallpox without any qualification whatever. The\r\nassumed prescience in 1799 is completely belied when we refer to\r\nhis arrogant manifesto of 1801. These are his words--\r\n\r\n  The scepticism that appeared amongst the most enlightened of\r\n  medical men, when my sentiments on Cowpox were first promulgated,\r\n  was highly laudable. To have admitted the truth of a doctrine,\r\n  at once so novel _and so unlike anything that ever appeared in\r\n  the Annals of Medicine_, without the test of the most rigid\r\n  scrutiny, would have bordered upon temerity; but now, when the\r\n  scrutiny has taken place, not only among ourselves, but in the\r\n  first professional circles in Europe, and when it has been\r\n  uniformly found in such abundant instances, that _the human\r\n  frame, when once it has felt the influence of the genuine Cowpox_\r\n  in the way that has been described, _is never afterwards_, at any\r\n  period of its existence, _assailable by the Smallpox_, may I not\r\n  with perfect confidence congratulate my country and society at\r\n  large on their beholding, in the mild form of Cowpox, an antidote\r\n  that is capable of extirpating from the earth a disease that is\r\n  every hour devouring its victims; a disease that has ever been\r\n  considered as the severest scourge of the human race![196]\r\n\r\nCowpox was thus set forth as a prophylactic with powers hitherto\r\nunknown and unique; so that Jenner was cut off from the claim of\r\nits equivalence with smallpox in character and consequences. He\r\nknew in 1799, as we have seen, that infection with smallpox did not\r\nrender the constitution proof against the subsequent influence of\r\nthe disease; but in 1801, as we see, it was his express contention\r\nthat what smallpox failed to do _that_ cowpox did--it protected\r\nthe constitution perfectly and for ever from smallpox, and nothing\r\nto compare with it had ever appeared in the Annals of Medicine. It\r\nwas only under the pressure of exposure and defeat that he humbled\r\nhimself to write to Dunning, 1st March, 1806--\r\n\r\n  The security given to the constitution by Vaccine Inoculation is\r\n  _exactly equal_ to that given by the Variolous. To expect more\r\n  from it would be wrong. As failures in the latter are constantly\r\n  presenting themselves, we must expect to find them in the former\r\n  also.[197]\r\n\r\nTo this pass was the infallible preservative from smallpox, with\r\nnothing to match it in the Annals of Medicine, reduced within the\r\nexperience of seven years!\r\n\r\nThe most thorough-going and far-reaching of Jenner’s excuses for\r\nvaccination failures were herpetic affections of the skin. In his\r\njournal we read--\r\n\r\n  Inoculated C. F. a second time. It is very evident that the\r\n  affection of the skin called red gum deadens the effect of the\r\n  Vaccine Virus. This infant was covered with it when inoculated\r\n  four days ago. The same happened with Mrs. D.’s infant.[198]\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Dunning he wrote from Cheltenham, October 25th, 1804--\r\n\r\n  How frequently does the Vaccine Disease become entangled with\r\n  herpes! I see that the herpetic fluid is one of those morbid\r\n  poisons which the human body generates, and when generated, that\r\n  it may be perpetuated by contact. Children who feed on trash at\r\n  this season of the year are apt to get distended bellies, and on\r\n  them it often appears about the lips. This is the most familiar\r\n  example that I know. _A single vesicle is capable of deranging\r\n  the action of the vaccine pustule._ Subdue it, and all goes on\r\n  correctly.[199]\r\n\r\nAnd again to the same correspondent, 23rd December, 1804--\r\n\r\n  My opinion is that the chief interference with the success of\r\n  Vaccination is herpes in some form or another. I have discovered\r\n  that it is a very Proteus, assuming as it thinks fit the\r\n  character of the greater part of the irritative eruptions that\r\n  assail us.[200]\r\n\r\nHaving thus detected an all-sufficient explanation of the failure\r\nof vaccination to prevent smallpox, he communicated his discovery\r\nto the _Medical and Physical Journal_, August, 1804, in a paper\r\nentitled, “On the Varieties and Modifications of the Vaccine\r\nPustule occasioned by an Herpetic State of the Skin,” but he\r\ncomplained to Dunning “that it seemed not to have excited the\r\nslightest interest.” In order to call attention afresh to the\r\nsubject, he had the article reprinted as a pamphlet at Cheltenham\r\nin 1806 and at Gloucester in 1819, but in vain. He complained to\r\nBaron in 1817 that he could not get the Board of the National\r\nVaccine Establishment to attend to his cautions touching the\r\ninterference of cutaneous diseases with the progress of the vaccine\r\nvesicle. “I am afraid,” he observed, “that the extreme ignorance\r\nof medical men on this subject will destroy the advantages which\r\nthe world ought to derive from the practice.”[201]\r\n\r\nWhat of course medical men with the least common sense perceived\r\nwas, that the excuse provided for vaccination failures was too\r\nliberal to be worth anything. If the least cutaneous eruption\r\nwas sufficient to frustrate vaccination, what operation could be\r\npronounced efficient? for it could scarcely be intended that every\r\npatient should be stripped to the skin and minutely examined for\r\nherpetic vesicles. There was nothing transitory in Jenner’s opinion\r\nabout herpes: he harped upon its mischiefs and omnipresence to the\r\nclose of his life. William Dillwyn of Walthamstow having asked\r\nhim for any observations that occurred to him on the practice of\r\nvaccination for the benefit of Friends in Philadelphia, Jenner\r\nreplied in a letter dated Berkeley, 19th August, 1818, in which we\r\nfind these remarks--\r\n\r\n  I must candidly acknowledge that I am not at all surprised that\r\n  a partial prejudice should now and then lift up its head against\r\n  Vaccination. It is called into existence, not from anything\r\n  faulty in the principle, but from its wrong and injudicious\r\n  application. For example, a child, or family of children,\r\n  may be in such a state, that the action of the vaccine fluid\r\n  when applied to the skin shall be either wholly or partially\r\n  resisted. It may either produce no effect at all, or it may\r\n  produce pustules varying considerably in their rise, progress\r\n  and general appearance from those which have been designated\r\n  _correct_. It was about the year 1804 that I was fortunate enough\r\n  to discover the general cause of these deviations, and no sooner\r\n  was it fully impressed on my mind, than I published it to the\r\n  world. Yet few, very few indeed, among those who vaccinate,\r\n  have paid any attention to it; yet I am confident, from the\r\n  review of the practice on an immense scale, that it is a matter\r\n  which has a greater claim on our attention than any one thing\r\n  besides connected with Vaccination--indeed I may say than any\r\n  other thing. What I allude to is a coincident eruptive state\r\n  of the skin, principally bearing what we call the herpetic or\r\n  eruptive character. If we vaccinate a child under its influence,\r\n  we are apt to create confusion. The pustule will participate in\r\n  the character of the herpetic blotch, and the two thus become\r\n  blended, forming an appearance that is neither vaccine nor\r\n  herpetic; but the worst of it is that the patient does not\r\n  receive that _perfect_ security from Smallpox infection which is\r\n  given by the perfect pustule.[202]\r\n\r\nThese complaints of the indifference of the medical world to his\r\nprophesying, show how completely the business of vaccination\r\nhad passed out of Jenner’s hands. The influence of herpes on\r\nvaccination, although declared by him to be of the utmost\r\nimportance, even to the extent of imperilling the advantages of the\r\npractice, was disregarded as unworthy of serious attention.\r\n\r\nAnother of Jenner’s apologetics was a pamphlet in 1808[203]\r\ndesigned to explain away the failure of the variolous test--the\r\ntest that deceived so many in the early days of vaccination. The\r\ninoculated with cowpox were inoculated with smallpox, and when\r\nthe smallpox did not “take,” it was said, “Behold the perfect\r\nprotection!” The smallpox inoculators complained bitterly of the\r\nhocus-pocus. “No wonder,” they said, “that when the system is in\r\na fever with bestial corruption, that human pox will not ‘take,’\r\nbut try after awhile.” And they did try after awhile, and it was\r\nfound that the vaccinated could be inoculated with smallpox like\r\nthe unvaccinated. Indeed, when it was seen that the vaccinated\r\nfell victims to smallpox, many who had been vaccinated resorted to\r\nthe smallpox inoculators for their supposed superior protection,\r\nand received it without hindrance from their previous vaccination.\r\nIt therefore became judicious to disown the variolous test; but\r\nneither in this case was the surrender frankly made, but with\r\nprevarication that deprived it of all grace. What the smallpox\r\ninoculators maintained, Jenner had to allow, but after this\r\nfashion--\r\n\r\n  My principal object is to guard those who may think fit\r\n  to inoculate with variolous matter after Vaccination from\r\n  unnecessary alarms; a pustule may sometimes be thus excited,\r\n  as on those who have previously gone through Smallpox; febrile\r\n  action in the constitution may follow; and, as has been\r\n  exemplified, a slight eruption.\r\n\r\nFor the variolous he recommended the substitution of the vaccine\r\ntest; saying--\r\n\r\n  At the commencement of Vaccination, I deemed the Variolous Test\r\n  necessary; but I now feel confident that we have one of equal\r\n  efficacy, and infinitely less hazardous in the re-insertion of\r\n  the vaccine lymph--\r\n\r\nWhich was to say that vaccination immediately after vaccination\r\nwould be found impossible--the later practice of periodical\r\nre-vaccination being unforeseen.\r\n\r\nJenner might have perceived that after his proclamation of the\r\ninfluence of herpes on vaccination, there was nothing to be said\r\nfor the variolous test. When he consented to run vaccination on\r\nthe same terms as variolation, and admitted that it would be wrong\r\nto expect more from the one practice than from the other, he was\r\nbound in consistency to allow that if vaccination was frustrated\r\nby eruptions of the skin, it was matter of consequence that\r\nvariolation should be frustrated by the fever of vaccination. He\r\ninformed Dillwyn that he destroyed cutaneous eruptions by the\r\napplication of _unguentum hydrargyri nitrati_, and then vaccinated\r\nwith success. The smallpox inoculators did so likewise. When the\r\nirritation induced by vaccination had had time to subside, they too\r\nvariolated with success.\r\n\r\nThe letter to Dillwyn, 1818, contains some other points which it\r\nis instructive to note. For example, the following passage proves\r\ntwo things, first, how notorious had become vaccination failures;\r\nand, second, how vaccination, from an easy art that any one might\r\npractise, had been converted into a mystery to which even “an\r\neminent surgeon” might be unequal. Jenner says--\r\n\r\n  One word more with respect to prejudice. How frequently have we\r\n  seen in the public prints paragraphs of this description--“A\r\n  gentleman’s family, consisting of three or four or half-a-dozen\r\n  children, were vaccinated by an eminent surgeon, and all went\r\n  through the disease in the most satisfactory manner, and were\r\n  pronounced safe; yet, on being exposed to the infection of\r\n  the Smallpox, they all had the disease, but happily they all\r\n  recovered.” Here, Sir, the mind becomes entangled with a false\r\n  association. The public conceive that _an eminent surgeon_ must\r\n  be a perfect master of this little branch of our art; but it\r\n  often happens that he has not stooped to look at anything beyond\r\n  its outline; and when deviations arise in the progress of the\r\n  pustules [as from herpes] to that extent which I have pointed\r\n  out as momentous, they are passed by without attracting any\r\n  particular attention.\r\n\r\nA report having got abroad that Jenner had renounced his faith in\r\nvaccination, he replied to Dillwyn--\r\n\r\n  My confidence in the efficacy of Vaccination to guard the\r\n  constitution from Smallpox is not in the least diminished.\r\n  That exceptions to the rule have appeared, and that they will\r\n  appear, I am ready to admit. They have happened after Smallpox\r\n  Inoculation; and by the same rule, as the two diseases are so\r\n  similar, they will also happen after Vaccine Inoculation.\r\n\r\nIn presence of such a declaration, it is easy to understand why\r\nthe _Inquiry_ with its supplements was kept out of print, and\r\nnever referred to. His confidence in vaccination not in the least\r\ndiminished! In the words cited, he surrendered afresh the claim\r\nwith which he started, and for which he was paid, namely, that\r\ninoculation with cowpox rendered the constitution proof against\r\nsmallpox for life, and that the protection thus afforded was\r\nwithout precedent in medical experience.\r\n\r\nHaving thus, under stress of necessity, reduced vaccination to the\r\nlevel of variolation, and tried to shelter the failures of the one\r\npractice under those of the other, the spirit of the old quack\r\nsurviving, he went on to prophesy in the familiar strain--\r\n\r\n  It is a curious and most delightful fact that Smallpox is flying\r\n  before Vaccination in all directions. In a wide district around\r\n  me, embracing the most populous part of the county of Gloucester,\r\n  the Smallpox is scarcely heard of; and if it does happen to\r\n  appear from infection brought by the wandering pauper, it either\r\n  finds itself insulated, or is rendered incapable of spreading\r\n  by giving immediately the vaccine security to those within its\r\n  atmosphere who may happen to remain unprotected.\r\n\r\nWith Jenner’s turn for romance, there is no need for dealing with a\r\nstatement like the foregoing seriously, else we might ask what was\r\nthe prevalence of smallpox in Gloucestershire before vaccination?\r\nand to what extent had it been cultivated by inoculators?\r\nThroughout England there was a remarkable subsidence of smallpox\r\nprecedent to the introduction of vaccination (for which vaccination\r\nobtained the credit), which subsidence was no doubt accelerated by\r\nthe cessation of variolation. Jenner resumes--\r\n\r\n  Wherever Vaccination has been _universally_ practised, there the\r\n  Smallpox ceases to exist. It matters not how wide the district,\r\n  or how populous the city, the result is, and, from the nature\r\n  of things, must be the same. There is scarcely a part of the\r\n  civilised world that cannot bear testimony to the truth of this\r\n  position. For extent of territory, we may turn our eyes to our\r\n  possessions in the East, and to various parts of South America;\r\n  and to towns and cities, many of the most conspicuous in Europe.\r\n\r\n  In the island of Ceylon, the ravages of Smallpox were dreadful,\r\n  although many efforts had been made to lessen its fatality by\r\n  Variolous Inoculation. This, wherever it was practised, produced\r\n  a spreading of the disease, and made a bad matter worse; so that\r\n  the people would have nothing to do with it. But after a little\r\n  time they took to Vaccine Inoculation very readily, and Smallpox\r\n  became totally extinct.\r\n\r\n  From Sweden, too, we have a report that proves the extinction of\r\n  Smallpox throughout the kingdom. Now as the good sense of the\r\n  Swedes brought about this happy event, why should not Britain\r\n  avail herself of the great gift, and employ it to the same\r\n  effect? Here the Boon is distributed with a partial and a sparing\r\n  hand, and consequently Smallpox still exists in several parts of\r\n  our island.\r\n\r\nThere was no checking Jenner when he rose into rhodomontade about\r\nthe myriads of Asia and the vastness of America, but descending to\r\nthe definite in Ceylon and Sweden we can test him with precision,\r\nand as to both we shall find his statements at wide variance with\r\nfacts. For the present, however, let us keep to our own country,\r\nand note especially what he had to assert of London in 1818--\r\n\r\n  Nevertheless I have the happiness to say, that since the first\r\n  promulgation of my discovery in 1798, the deaths of Smallpox in\r\n  the British Realms, according to the best estimates I can form,\r\n  are reduced from more than 40,000 to less than 6,000 annually.\r\n  The metropolis for the last ten or twelve years exhibited a\r\n  reduction of about one half only; but during the last two years,\r\n  Vaccination has been more extensively practised than ever, both\r\n  from the benevolence of private individuals and the faculty,\r\n  and by public institutions; and this year, 1818, promises a far\r\n  greater reduction in the number of deaths than any that has\r\n  preceded it.\r\n\r\nIn London in 1818 the deaths from smallpox were low (421); but a\r\nsingle year is of little account, and must be viewed in relation to\r\npreceding years. Here we have a statement for the decade, 1811-20,\r\ntaken from the metropolitan Bills of Mortality.\r\n\r\n               Burials from     From      From     From\r\n       YEARS.  all diseases.

How, we ask, could the vaccination of one-tenth of the\r\nLondoners (if so many) reduce the smallpox among nine-tenths? We\r\nhave also to observe that mortality from fevers abated in common\r\nwith smallpox; and it cannot be pretended that that abatement was\r\nalso due to vaccination! The rational assumption is, that what\r\ndiminished fevers in London, likewise diminished smallpox. Nor\r\nshould we overlook the fact, that as the deaths from smallpox\r\ndeclined, those from measles increased; nor the probability that\r\nmany deaths formerly ascribed to smallpox were derived from\r\nmeasles, and that part of the decline in one column is accounted\r\nfor by the increase in the other.\r\n\r\nJenner’s assertion, that the national mortality from smallpox had\r\nbeen reduced from more than 40,000 to less than 6000 annually,\r\nhad no basis whatever in reality. As we know, the 40,000 deaths\r\nwere got by multiplying the deaths of a bad year of London smallpox\r\nby the population of the United Kingdom--as if London were the\r\nstandard of England, Ireland, and Scotland! How he obtained the\r\nreduced number of 6000 we are left to conjecture. In reviewing\r\nJenner’s writings we are startled with his inconsistencies,\r\nand scarcely less with the carelessness and credulity of his\r\nadherents. He set out with the common knowledge that cowpox did\r\n_not_ prevent smallpox, and for that reason he substituted pox\r\ngenerated by horsegrease on the cow. Horsegrease cowpox could\r\nnot, however, be procured on demand; and was, moreover, disliked\r\non the score of its origin; and cowpox was resorted to by Pearson\r\nand Woodville, and diffused everywhere with acclamation; and\r\nJenner did not only not object, but took credit, and actually was\r\nallowed to take credit for the pox he had described as ineffective\r\nfor the purpose designed! By and bye cowpox from horsegrease,\r\nor horsepox, according to the original recipe, was obtained and\r\nbrought into circulation with Jenner’s sympathy, if without his\r\nopen approval--he discerning that praise and pay were not to be\r\nhad from that notion. After a while, horsegrease, or horsepox, was\r\nused for inoculation without the intervention of the cow; and that\r\ntoo entered into currency as vaccine, Jenner himself employing and\r\ndistributing it, although according to his _Inquiry_ it was not to\r\nbe trusted to prevent smallpox.\r\n\r\nI repeat these facts, even at the risk of tedium, because it is\r\nessential to have them clearly apprehended. For at least three\r\ndescriptions of virus Jenner stood responsible, namely--\r\n\r\nI.--Horsegrease Cowpox--the virus warranted in his _Inquiry_.\r\n\r\nII.--Cowpox, known by Jenner to be ineffective in preventing\r\nsmallpox, but favoured by the medical profession and the public.\r\n\r\nIII.--Horsegrease (said to have been horsepox), also described by\r\nJenner as ineffective, but latterly used and diffused by him.\r\n\r\nTo which of these did he attribute the success claimed for\r\nvaccination? Apparently to all indifferently; but if one were as\r\ngood as the others, why did he not say so, and proceed to explain\r\nhow it was that cowpox did not save the Gloucestershire milk-maids,\r\nnor horsegrease the farriers from smallpox? Was it that the power\r\nto put such questions, and to answer them, does not consist with\r\nthe quack’s intelligence; and that in his lucre he rests content?\r\nObserve, too, how when credit was to be had for London vaccination,\r\nJenner took it, though at mortal enmity with the chief agent in the\r\nwork, repudiating Walker’s practice as subversive of principles he\r\nconsidered essential to success.\r\n\r\nJenner’s final publication in 1822 had nothing to do with\r\nvaccination, but was a bid for fame in a new direction.[204] It was\r\nan attempt to originate a new method of cure by irritating the skin\r\nwith tartarated antimony. He had dabbled with the chemical when\r\na young man, and John Hunter had suggested that his preparation\r\nshould be sold and puffed as Jenner’s Tartar Emetic. In his last\r\nyears he returned to it, and produced a series of cases to prove\r\nhow many diseases might be alleviated and removed by using it as a\r\ncounter-irritant--just as in the _Inquiry_ he recommended cowpox\r\ninoculation with the same intention. The matter does not concern\r\nus further than to observe that the vesicles and scars produced\r\nby tartarated antimony are almost indistinguishable from those of\r\nvaccination; and that Hufeland, the German Nestor of Medicine,\r\ntaught and proved that tartar emetic was every whit as effective\r\nagainst smallpox as cowpox--an opinion from which I see no reason\r\nto dissent.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[190] _A Popular Summary of Vaccination with reference to its\r\nEfficacy and Probable Cause of Failure._ By John Marshall, M.R.C.S.\r\nand District Vaccinator of the National Vaccine Establishment.\r\nLondon, 1830.

It is verbose and\r\nloosely put together, and would never be read unless by some one\r\nin quest of information, or with nothing better to do. Fortunately\r\nBaron was reverent and not critical. Jenner was to him a sacred\r\nbeing, admirable in all relations, whose only contention was with\r\n“the blindness and wickedness of his traducers.” Lives written in\r\nthis temper are often most instructive. Tales are told and letters\r\nproduced in pious simplicity that biographers of the judicious\r\norder discreetly suppress.\r\n\r\nBaron made Jenner’s acquaintance in the summer of 1808 when he was\r\nliving at Fladong’s Hotel, Oxford Street, revelling in a fool’s\r\nparadise as to his importance in the formation of the National\r\nVaccine Establishment. Baron had recently come from Edinburgh, and\r\nsays,--\r\n\r\n  I was about to commence practice: all the world was before me.\r\n  In seeking the acquaintance of Jenner I was impelled mainly by a\r\n  desire to do homage to a man whose public and private character\r\n  had already secured my warmest admiration. I little thought that\r\n  it would so speedily lead to an intimacy, and ultimately to a\r\n  friendship, which terminated only at his death, and placed me in\r\n  a relationship to his memory that no one could have anticipated.\r\n  The greatness of his fame, his exalted talents, and the honours\r\n  heaped upon him by all the most distinguished public bodies of\r\n  the civilised world, while they made me desirous of offering\r\n  my tribute of respect to him, forbade the expectation of more\r\n  than such an acknowledgment as a youth, circumstanced as I was,\r\n  might have expected. I soon, however, perceived that I had to do\r\n  with an individual who did not square his manners by the cold\r\n  formality of the world. He condescended as to an equal; the\r\n  restraint and embarrassment that might naturally have been felt\r\n  in the presence of one so eminent vanished in an instant. The\r\n  simple dignity of his aspect, the kind and familiar tone of his\r\n  language, and the perfect sincerity and good faith manifested in\r\n  all he said and did, could not fail to win the heart of anyone\r\n  not insensible to such qualities. Though more than twenty years\r\n  have elapsed since this interview took place, I remember it, and\r\n  all its accompaniments, with the most perfect accuracy. He was\r\n  dressed in a blue coat, white waistcoat, nankeen breeches, and\r\n  white stockings. All the tables in his apartment were covered\r\n  with letters and papers on the subject of vaccination, and the\r\n  establishment of the National Vaccine Institution. He talked\r\n  to me of the excellent article which had lately appeared in\r\n  the _Edinburgh Review_, relative to the vaccine controversy.\r\n  He spoke with great good humour also of the conduct of the\r\n  anti-vaccinists, and gave me some pamphlets illustrative of the\r\n  controversy then going on. The day before he had had an interview\r\n  with the Princess of Wales, and he showed me a watch which her\r\n  Royal Highness had presented to him on that occasion.[205]\r\n\r\nThe passage is a long one, but it has some value in itself, and\r\nexhibits Baron’s habitual attitude toward his hero. In his private\r\nrelations, Jenner was amiable, but it is with his public life\r\nthat we are concerned, and find so reprehensible. Mischievous\r\nleaders and teachers are frequently distinguished by private\r\ngraces; and austere personal virtue is frequently associated with\r\nbland indifference to conventional immoralities; and we need\r\nnot go far to discover counterparts of Jenner in ordinary life.\r\nNothing is commoner than suavity combined with self-love that is\r\nmalignant and mendacious when thwarted. All is pleasant as long\r\nas admiration prevails, but with dissent or resistance the sunny\r\ntemper vanishes, and clouds of contempt and fury overspread the\r\nspiritual sky. A sharp test of character is a man’s disposition to\r\nhis adversaries; and Jenner was never magnanimous. His conduct to\r\nPearson, Woodville, and Walker has been sufficiently described; and\r\nsimilar jealousy and spitefulness were displayed to whoever dared\r\nto impugn his infallibility in the prevention of smallpox. No one,\r\nfor instance, could have brought forward the fact that smallpox\r\noccasionally succeeded vaccination with more simple good faith than\r\nGoldson; yet Jenner wrote of him with insufferable insolence--an\r\ninsolence that is thrown into stronger relief by the knowledge\r\nthat what Goldson testified is accepted at this day, even by\r\nvaccinators, as indisputable matter-of-course. His bully, too, John\r\nRing, attacked Goldson, and Jenner, in writing to Dunning, 23rd\r\nDecember, 1804, thus excused his brutality--\r\n\r\n  You speak of Ring and Goldson. Recollect there was not time to\r\n  be cool. What lover of Vaccination--what man, well acquainted\r\n  with its nature, and that of Smallpox, could read Goldson’s book,\r\n  and lay it down coolly? Ring, the moment he read it, and what\r\n  indeed was infinitely worse than the book itself, its murderous\r\n  harbinger--the advertisement, instantly charged his blunderbuss,\r\n  and fired it in the face of the author. I must freely confess, I\r\n  do not feel so cool about this Mr. Goldson as you do. His book\r\n  has sent many a victim to a premature grave; and would have sent\r\n  many more, but for the humanity and zeal of yourself and others\r\n  who stepped forward to counteract its dreadful tendency.[206]\r\n\r\nIn the same spirit he wrote to Baron, 6th November, 1810, of Brown\r\nof Musselburgh, who had reported certain cases of smallpox after\r\nvaccination in a London newspaper--\r\n\r\n  Some notice must be taken of Mr. Brown’s communication; but\r\n  if he thinks he shall be able to draw me into controversy, he\r\n  will be mistaken. His letter, under the veil of candour and\r\n  liberality, is full of fraud and artifice; for he knows that\r\n  every insinuation and argument he has advanced, have been\r\n  refuted by the first medical characters in Edinburgh and Dublin.\r\n  But the mild, gentle, complaisant antagonist, is a character\r\n  more difficult to deal with than one who boldly shows his\r\n  ferocity.[207]\r\n\r\nAs applied to Brown, sagacious and sincere, this was the very\r\necstasy of abuse. Even Brown’s adversaries within his own\r\nneighbourhood, ultimately yielded to his contention. In the\r\n_Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal_ of July, 1818, we read--\r\n\r\n  Before we conclude, we must in justice to ourselves pay the\r\n  _amende honorable_ to Mr. Brown of Musselburgh, whose opinions we\r\n  strenuously controverted in 1809; and to which we now, in 1818,\r\n  confess ourselves partly converts in consequence of increased\r\n  experience and observation.\r\n\r\nIn short, calm discussion of vaccination with Jenner was never\r\npossible. Inquiry was borne down with clamour, and scepticism\r\ndenounced as malevolence. “He could not altogether escape,” says\r\nBaron, “from the annoyance occasioned by _the blindness and\r\nwickedness_ of his traducers”[208]--and all were traducers who were\r\nnot believers. Indeed, Baron could only account for the perversity\r\nof those who did not recognise Jenner as the saviour of mankind\r\nfrom smallpox by a resort to the doctrine of inbred depravity,\r\nsaying--\r\n\r\n  We are compelled to believe that there is a principle in our\r\n  nature which has too strong an affinity for what is untrue to\r\n  permit the understanding to discern or acknowledge an opposite\r\n  principle till both the moral and intellectual vision has been\r\n  purified and strengthened.[209]\r\n\r\nPurified and strengthened, and the affinity with falsehood\r\ndissolved, it became possible for the understanding to appreciate\r\nthe virtue of cowpox and the veracity of its advertiser!\r\n\r\nJenner, it may be said, instinctively resented investigation. He\r\nwas uneasy in conscious duplicity. He knew there was no safety\r\nin vaccination as practised; for the cowpox employed was not the\r\nhorsegrease cowpox he had commended as efficacious. What he had\r\nprescribed was disregarded; what he had condemned was approved;\r\nbut, strange to say, he was praised and rewarded by the world as\r\nif cowpox had been his specific! Jenner accepted the situation,\r\nand possibly came to believe (after a fashion) that he was\r\nenjoying no more than his own; but under the circumstances it\r\nwas not surprising that he shrank from criticism, kept his early\r\npublications out of the way, and resorted to scolding and shrieking\r\nwhenever scrutiny appeared imminent.\r\n\r\nWorse even than his behaviour to investigators and opponents was\r\nhis treatment of those who converted vaccination to practice.\r\nThe _Inquiry_ was no handbook, and Pearson, Woodville, and other\r\nearly vaccinators, had to make their own way, not only unassisted,\r\nbut with Jenner ready to appropriate their successes and to\r\nreproach them with their failures. Baron avers that nothing in\r\nthe art of vaccination was due to any one but Jenner himself,\r\nqualifying this praise with a slight exception in favour of Dr.\r\nBryce of Edinburgh, who made the discovery that if a subject under\r\nvaccination is re-vaccinated, the subsequent inoculation is caught\r\nup and brought to maturity with the precedent--a phenomenon that\r\nas Bryce’s Test was used to ascertain whether true vaccine fever\r\nwas operative. But even Bryce received scant acknowledgment, and\r\nBaron tries to make out that Jenner was possessed of the fact ere\r\nit was announced.[210] Jenner’s meanness toward those who displayed\r\nany intelligent independence in co-operation with him is written\r\nat large in Baron’s biography, but with such innocence that it\r\nwould be absurd to describe it as indecent. His good faith is\r\nperfect, and it is only a critical reader that finds out how he is\r\nidentified with Jenner, seeing merit nowhere save in his abject\r\nservitors and feminine _claque_.\r\n\r\nVaccinators at this day allow that the influence of vaccination\r\nwears out and ought to be renewed; yet Jenner would not listen for\r\na moment to such a modification of its perpetual prophylaxy. Baron\r\nwrites--\r\n\r\n  The year 1804, in Jenner’s estimation, formed an era in the\r\n  history of the Variolæ Vaccinæ. The assertion, that the Cowpox\r\n  afforded only a temporary security was then insisted on. Had it\r\n  been correct, it would have deprived the discovery of nearly\r\n  all its value. This assertion was very easily made; and in the\r\n  infancy of the practice could not be well disproved. To these\r\n  circumstances it was owing, that the crude and unsupported\r\n  statements of Mr. Goldson acquired any influence. Dr. Jenner\r\n  himself, from the commencement, perceived that in his cases of\r\n  failure, Cowpox had never been properly taken.[211]\r\n\r\nWhen in 1813 Lord Boringdon introduced his bill to Parliament for\r\nthe restriction of variolation, Lord Ellenborough observed--\r\n\r\n  No doubt Vaccination is of some use, but if the noble lord\r\n  considers it a complete preventive of Smallpox, I differ from\r\n  him in opinion. At the same time, I have proved my respect for\r\n  the discovery by having my eight children vaccinated. I believe\r\n  in the efficacy of Vaccination to a certain extent. It may\r\n  prevent the disorder for eight or nine years; and in a large city\r\n  like this with a large family of children, even this limited\r\n  protection is desirable.\r\n\r\nIn this declaration the Chief Justice was not singular, but\r\nexpressed the general conviction of the public who held by\r\nvaccination in spite of the manifest failure of the early promises\r\nmade for it. Nevertheless Jenner was extremely annoyed: it was to\r\nhim as the formal deliverance of judgment. Baron says--\r\n\r\n  I have seldom seen Jenner more disturbed than he was by this\r\n  occurrence; not certainly because he had any fears that the\r\n  unsupported assertion of his lordship would prove correct, but\r\n  because it unhappily accorded with popular prejudices, and when\r\n  uttered by such a person, in such an assembly, was calculated\r\n  to do unspeakable mischief by unsettling the confidence of\r\n  numberless anxious parents, and by attempting to deprive\r\n  Vaccination of more than half its virtue.[212]\r\n\r\nThorough was Baron in his defence of Jenner: no inconsistency\r\nappalled him. He records in capitals (as produced) the following\r\nas Jenner’s solemn and final testimony, written, a few days before\r\nhe expired, on the back of a letter, bearing the post-mark, 14th\r\nJanuary, 1823--\r\n\r\n  MY OPINION OF VACCINATION IS PRECISELY AS IT WAS WHEN I FIRST\r\n  PROMULGATED THE DISCOVERY. IT IS NOT IN THE LEAST STRENGTHENED\r\n  BY ANY EVENT THAT HAS HAPPENED, FOR IT COULD GAIN NO STRENGTH;\r\n  IT IS NOT IN THE LEAST WEAKENED, FOR IF THE FAILURES YOU SPEAK\r\n  OF HAD NOT HAPPENED, THE TRUTH OF MY ASSERTIONS RESPECTING THOSE\r\n  COINCIDENCES WHICH OCCASIONED THEM WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MADE\r\n  OUT.[213]\r\n\r\nSelf-deception after this pattern is far from uncommon, and is\r\nproof against evidence and death itself; but Jenner was not\r\nquite so crazy as his words imply. From his first opinion about\r\nvaccination, and its absolute efficacy against smallpox (unlike\r\nanything hitherto known in medical experience) he had retreated\r\nconsiderably. Even so early as 1804 he had reduced his claim for\r\nvaccination to equality with variolation. In that year he observed--\r\n\r\n  What I have said on Vaccination is true. If properly conducted,\r\n  it secures the constitution as much as Variolous Inoculation\r\n  possibly can. It is the Smallpox in a purer form than that which\r\n  has been current among us for twelve centuries past.[214]\r\n\r\nAnd again Baron cites him as saying--\r\n\r\n  Duly and efficiently performed, Vaccination will protect the\r\n  constitution from subsequent attacks of Smallpox, as much as that\r\n  disease itself will. _I never expected that it would do more_,\r\n  and it will not, I believe, do less.[215]\r\n\r\nJenner presumed freely on the forgetfulness of those he addressed.\r\nIn a document so well known as his petition to the House of Commons\r\nin 1802, he expressly claimed that a person inoculated with cowpox\r\nwas thereby “rendered perfectly secure from the infection of\r\nsmallpox through life”; nor would the furore which attended the\r\nintroduction of the practice have been possible had it been set\r\nforth as no more than a milder form of variolation. That cowpox\r\nwas equivalent to smallpox for inoculation was laughed at by\r\nthe variolators; but that a vaccinated person was as safe from\r\nsmallpox as one who had passed through the disease, was true in no\r\nother sense than that Jenner wished it to be true, and prophesied\r\naccordingly. It was by such contrivances that he broke his own\r\nfall, and alleviated the disenchantment of the credulous.\r\n\r\nOddly enough Jenner’s fiction, that vaccination was as good against\r\nsmallpox as smallpox itself, was revived in the innocence of\r\nignorance by Sir William Gull before a committee of the House of\r\nCommons in 1871. “Vaccination is as protective against smallpox\r\nas smallpox itself,” said the fashionable physician. Confutation\r\nwas, however, at hand. Mr. Marson (for thirty-five years resident\r\nsurgeon of the Highgate Smallpox Hospital) attested that cases of\r\nsmallpox after smallpox were comparatively rare--not 1 per cent.;\r\nwhilst 84 per cent. of those admitted to the Hospital in 1864 were\r\nvaccinated. An instructive contrast between the logic of fancy and\r\nmatter of fact!\r\n\r\nBaron, with unscrupulous disregard of evidence, complains that\r\nvaccination should ever have been represented as an infallible\r\npreventive of smallpox; so that as pointed out in the Report of the\r\nRoyal College of Physicians in 1807, “the fate of the new practice\r\nwas made to hang on the occurrence of a single case of smallpox”;\r\nand goes on to observe--\r\n\r\n  This, I am sorry to say, was a great misapprehension; the\r\n  opposers of Vaccination endeavoured to place the fate of\r\n  Vaccination on such an issue; but if Jenner’s principles be\r\n  duly considered, he never at any time sanctioned such an idea;\r\n  and long before the practice of Vaccination became general, he\r\n  anticipated failures, and explained the circumstances under which\r\n  they were most likely to occur.[216]\r\n\r\nThe summary answer to this statement is, that it is untrue. Jenner\r\nanticipated no failures. On the contrary, he vehemently denied\r\nthem; and when denial could no longer avail, he invented a variety\r\nof excuses, such as spurious cowpox and omnipresent herpes, to\r\naccount for their occurrence; though always ready (as we have seen)\r\nto hark back to his original assertion that vaccination was “an\r\ninfallible preventive of smallpox.” Baron did not like the word\r\n“infallibility.” He writes--\r\n\r\n  I am not sure that the expression was ever used by Dr. Jenner\r\n  himself. If he did use it, he certainly very soon accompanied\r\n  it with the necessary qualification. He may perhaps at the\r\n  outset have stated his opinion somewhat too decidedly; but no\r\n  one qualified to judge can doubt that from the very beginning he\r\n  was possessed of the gauge by which to measure the virtues of\r\n  Vaccination.[217]\r\n\r\nWhether he did make use of the word “infallible” is of slight\r\nimportance. There are various modes in which the same meaning may\r\nbe conveyed, and Jenner’s was unequivocal. It was in 1801 that\r\nappealing to the rigid scrutiny that had taken place in the first\r\nprofessional circles of Europe, he deliberately proclaimed it as\r\ncertain--\r\n\r\n  That the human frame, when once it has felt the influence of\r\n  the genuine Cowpox in the way that has been described, is never\r\n  afterwards, at any period of its existence, assailable by the\r\n  Smallpox.[218]\r\n\r\nWhen Lord Ellenborough in 1813 described vaccination as affording\r\nno more than a temporary security from smallpox, he merely\r\nexpressed the diminished confidence of the community in the\r\npractice; but it is the habit of adventurers to ascribe adverse\r\nmanifestations of public feeling to petty causes; and thus Jenner\r\nheld that the Chief Justice was indulging a personal grudge when he\r\nthrew doubt on the perpetual efficacy of his prescription. On one\r\noccasion, so ran the story, Ellenborough was relating in a company\r\nat St. James’s how Jenner had so little faith in cowpox that he\r\nhad used smallpox to inoculate his own child, when he was suddenly\r\nconfronted by an irate personage, who exclaimed, “I am Dr. Jenner,\r\nand what you have stated is not true!” whereupon Ellenborough slunk\r\naside in confusion. The fact of the rencontre in the sensational\r\nform, we may credit as we please; but about the variolation of\r\nJenner’s child there is no doubt whatever. We have the circumstance\r\nrecorded by himself with such explanation as he considered adequate.\r\n\r\nTurning to the _Inquiry_, we find under Case XXII. that Robert F.\r\nJenner, aged eleven months, was vaccinated on 12th April, 1798,\r\nand that he did not receive the infection. The operation was not\r\nrepeated, and he remained unvaccinated. Some time afterwards,\r\nwhilst Jenner was residing at Cheltenham, Mr. Cother, a surgeon,\r\nhappened to drop in, and having taken the child in his arms,\r\nmentioned in the course of conversation, that he had just left a\r\nfamily suffering from smallpox. “Sir,” cried Jenner, “you know not\r\nwhat you are doing! That child is not protected.” What was to be\r\ndone? “There was no doubt on my mind,” says Jenner, “that the boy\r\nwas infected;” and having none of the precious horsegrease cowpox\r\nin his possession, he held that he was without alternative, and by\r\nMr. Cother the lad was immediately inoculated with smallpox.\r\n\r\nThe fact in due course got abroad, and, as Baron relates, was made\r\nthe most of by the opponents of vaccination--\r\n\r\n  One observed, “Dr. Jenner may say what he likes about\r\n  Vaccination, but we know for certain that he has inoculated his\r\n  own son with Smallpox.” Another repeated this statement with the\r\n  addition, that he had done so because he mistrusted Vaccination.\r\n  A third added another tint to deepen the colouring, affirming\r\n  that he knew that Dr. Jenner had abandoned his confidence in\r\n  Vaccination, and the proof is incontestable, as he has inoculated\r\n  his own child with Smallpox. These stories passed from mouth to\r\n  mouth, and afterwards appeared in print with every malignant\r\n  interpretation.[219]\r\n\r\nSuch talk was very natural, nor was it without justification.\r\nJenner ought to have proved his sincerity by the vaccination of\r\nhis son; and he who denounced variolation and variolators with\r\nsuch bitterness might have accepted the risk of infection from\r\nMr. Cother rather than have compromised himself so injuriously.\r\nMoreover (as was asked at the time) if the child was infected, what\r\nwas the use of inoculation? Variolation and vaccination (it was\r\nargued) may be serviceable in keeping off smallpox, but are of no\r\navail after infection.\r\n\r\nVaccination has been described as a remarkable survival of\r\nsuperstition in hygiene--many, who disowning all other dodges for\r\nthe maintenance of health, holding by it. Of course Jenner knew\r\nnothing of hygiene in the scientific sense--it was revealed after\r\nhis time; but it is noteworthy that in none of his publications\r\nor letters is there any anticipation of the truth that has proved\r\nso fruitful in our experience, namely, that ill-health indicates\r\nill-living, and that the misery of disease is only remediable in\r\nso far as we come out of the conditions of disease. Whilst of\r\nsuch truth he knew nothing, he might have known something. It lay\r\nplainly before him that smallpox was an affliction of the poor,\r\nand of the prosperous in so far as they shared the conditions of\r\nthe poor, but he never recognised the fact. On the contrary, he\r\ncherished the fantasy that various diseases were derived from\r\nassociation with animals; and that thus smallpox originated in\r\ncowpox, which in turn came from horsegrease. “There,” said he\r\nto his nephew, pointing to a horse with greasy heels, “there is\r\nthe source of smallpox.”[220] To entertain such an opinion was\r\nto be stone-blind to the true causes of disease, and therefore\r\nwe have no reason for surprise that the Jenner household lived\r\nin chronic ill-health, piously submissive to what they supposed\r\nthe divine will. Typhus fever was recurrent in the household\r\nwithout a suspicion that anything was amiss on the human side.\r\nThere was a genius named Dawes Worgan, whom Jenner received into\r\nhis family as tutor to his son, but ere a year had elapsed the\r\npoor fellow had two attacks of typhus, and finally succumbed to\r\npulmonary consumption in 1809, in his nineteenth year. Chantry\r\nCottage, Jenner’s residence at Berkeley, was no temple of Hygeia:\r\non the contrary, such a place at this day would be a terror to a\r\nrespectable neighbourhood, and subject to the attention of the\r\nsanitary inspector.\r\n\r\nThe principle of vaccination conceded--that health may be purchased\r\nby disease, it was not surprising that it was thought that measles\r\nand scarlet fever could be extirpated by similar treatment. Sir\r\nHumphry Davy suggested that hydrophobia might be anticipated by the\r\ninoculation of another animal virus, but Jenner held that cowpox\r\nshould be tried--“nothing like leather.” It was reported from\r\nConstantinople that the plague itself was stayed by vaccination,\r\nand that experiments, exactly like those used to demonstrate its\r\npower against smallpox, had been repeated with complete success.\r\nThere was not, however, enterprise in the East for the development\r\nof the quackery.\r\n\r\nJenner taught that distemper in dogs was preventible by\r\nvaccination, and accumulated a variety of “first-rate evidence”\r\nin proof. It was no transitory whim. He vaccinated twenty of the\r\nKing’s staghounds in 1801, and in 1809 contributed a paper to the\r\nMedico-Chirurgical Society on the subject, wherein he expressed\r\nthe opinion that the disease had only existed in England for the\r\npast half century. Several great fox hunters had their hounds\r\nvaccinated, and the results were pronounced satisfactory.[221]\r\nWhy, then, was the practice not continued? Why is not distemper\r\nexterminated? May we not say the reason is plain? The first-rate\r\nevidence was illusory. Men are apt to create the facts they wish\r\nfor, but as desire subsides, they recover their normal eyesight.\r\nCowpox, we are persuaded, was as good against distemper in dogs as\r\nagainst smallpox in human beings, and but for extraneous causes, it\r\nwould have been abandoned for the one as for the other.\r\n\r\nFor Jenner it has to be said, that if deceived, he had much to\r\nexcuse his self-deception. There are men possessed of convictions\r\nwhich they maintain in the face of an indifferent or antagonistic\r\nworld, but Jenner was not such a man. If his _Inquiry_ had gone\r\nthe way of waste-paper, he would have offered no resistance; but\r\ninstead, it was proclaimed by Pearson as worthy of universal\r\nattention, and the hour being propitious, the middle-aged country\r\ndoctor suddenly found himself treated as the deliverer of mankind\r\nfrom smallpox, whilst Pearson, his promoter, was swept aside as\r\na half-hearted worshipper of the new divinity. Adulation was\r\nadministered without measure, and if Jenner took it for true, and\r\nwas led to imagine that he had more in him than he ever imagined,\r\nwhat marvel! He became the centre of a European craze of a\r\ncharacter and intensity that is perhaps without parallel. Emperors\r\nand kings, statesmen and philanthropists, men of science, and\r\nin short the whole educated world conspired to do him reverence.\r\nThe craze gradually abated, and the abatement was most decided\r\nin the country of its origin, and chiefly in London where cowpox\r\nand its advertiser were most closely scrutinised. Jenner abhorred\r\nLondon. There he had proposed to flourish as a West-End physician,\r\nand there he had encountered a dismal failure. There, too, his\r\nantagonists were active, and their demonstration of the futility\r\nof his assertions most conclusive. We see his temper toward London\r\nin such a passage as the following from a letter to Dunning, dated\r\nCheltenham, 21st February, 1806--\r\n\r\n  What havoc the Anti-Vaccinists have made in town by the\r\n  re-introduction of Variolous Inoculation! It is computed that\r\n  not less than 6000 persons in the metropolis, and the adjacent\r\n  villages, have fallen victims to the Smallpox since April last.\r\n  One would scarcely conceive it possible, but these murders are,\r\n  for the most part, to be attributed to the absurd productions of\r\n  Moseley, Rowley, and that pert little Squirrel, to say nothing\r\n  of Goldson. It is about London that the venom of these deadly\r\n  serpents chiefly flows.[222]\r\n\r\nWhilst the doors of almost every scientific corporation in the\r\nworld were thrown open to receive him, the Royal College of\r\nPhysicians of London maintained an honourable reserve; and when\r\nin 1814 his claim to admission was strongly urged, the majority\r\ninsisted that, if received, he should submit to the usual\r\nexamination--a sufficient check in Jenner’s case.[223] The College\r\nhas been reproached for its treatment of “the immortal benefactor\r\nof the human race,” but it is forgotten how intimately the leading\r\nmembers were acquainted with his immortality, and with what\r\ndisgust they must have received his confession in 1807 as to the\r\nnon-existence of spurious cowpox.\r\n\r\nToward the close of his life, Jenner rarely appeared in London.\r\nHis last visit took place in 1814, when he was presented to the\r\nEmperor of Russia. “I am happy to think,” said Alexander, “that\r\nyou have received the thanks, the applause, and the gratitude of\r\nthe world;” to which Jenner made answer, “I have received the\r\nthanks and the applause, but _not_ the gratitude of the world”--the\r\nabsent gratitude being a periphrase for absent cash, and a hint\r\nto the Czar that he might repeat the superb munificence of his\r\ngrandmother, Catharine, to her inoculator Dimsdale. The Emperor,\r\nhowever, gave nothing, and Jenner retired keenly disappointed.\r\nWhatever the imperial disposition, Jenner did little to render it\r\nmore propitious by using his audience to denounce Walker and the\r\nFriends by whom vaccination was at that time chiefly promoted; for\r\nas Alexander said, “I love the good Quakers: they are my friends,\r\nindeed;” and whoever slandered them was not likely to advance in\r\nhis favour.\r\n\r\nWith all he got Jenner reckoned himself ill-paid; and taking\r\nthe words of his admirers for sincere, he was ill-paid. Many a\r\nsuccessful slayer of his kind had much more from the House of\r\nCommons with less fuss than their ideal preserver; but there is\r\noften a measure of sincerity within insincerity, and many of those\r\nwho praised Jenner most rapturously felt that he had not been dealt\r\nwith illiberally as the advertiser of cowpox.\r\n\r\nJenner’s wife died in 1815, an ailing, pious, affectionate woman,\r\nand thenceforth he dwelt in retirement until his death on the\r\n26th of January, 1823, at the age of seventy-four. “Never,” he\r\nwrote to his friend Gardner on 13th January, a week before his\r\ndemise, “Never was I involved in so many perplexities.” Hailed with\r\nacclamation in 1800-2 as the saviour of mankind from smallpox,\r\nduring the remaining twenty years of his life he underwent a\r\nsteady course of discredit as failure after failure was recorded\r\nand attested against vaccination. Appropriate therefore was\r\nhis farewell to the world in 1823, “Never was I involved in so\r\nmany perplexities.” There was not enthusiasm left to effect the\r\ninterment of his remains in Westminster Abbey, and the funeral\r\ntook place at Berkeley. An attempt was made to obtain a grant from\r\nParliament for a monument, but the proposal fell flat. Baron then\r\nset on foot a subscription for the purpose, but it met with little\r\nencouragement. The only public bodies which contributed anything\r\nwere the Edinburgh Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons, the first\r\nsending £50 and the second £10. With much difficulty sufficient\r\nwas scraped together to order a statue from Sievier, which was\r\nset up at the west end of the nave of Gloucester Cathedral. The\r\nfront panel of the pedestal originally bore the dates of birth and\r\ndeath, but Baron had them removed, considering the word JENNER all\r\nsignificant.\r\n\r\nIn latter times, in 1859, a statue was erected to his memory in\r\nTrafalgar Square, London, close by the College of Physicians, but\r\nit was felt to have an air of possible quackery about it, and by\r\nand bye was quietly removed to a corner in Kensington Gardens.\r\nThere is, as I have remarked, a measure of sincerity even in\r\ninsincerity; and it is impossible for any one with a lively sense\r\nof veracity to _know_ Edward Jenner and entertain for him any\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[205] Vol. ii. p. 136.\r\n\r\n[206] Vol. ii. p. 24.\r\n\r\n[207] _Ibid._ p. 47.\r\n\r\n[208] Vol. ii. p. 148.\r\n\r\n[209] Vol. ii. p. 110.\r\n\r\n[210] Vol. i. p. 450.\r\n\r\n[211] Vol. ii. p. 18.\r\n\r\n[212] Vol. ii. p. 197.\r\n\r\n[213] Vol. ii. p. 311\r\n\r\n[214] Vol. ii. p. 15.\r\n\r\n[215] Vol. ii. p. 135.\r\n\r\n[216] Vol. ii. p. 135.\r\n\r\n[217] Vol. ii. p. 134\r\n\r\n[218] _Continuation of Facts and Observations_, p. 181.\r\n\r\n[219] Vol. ii. pp. 43-49 and 198.\r\n\r\n[220] Vol. i. p. 135.\r\n\r\n[221] Vol. i. pp. 444, 450; Vol. ii. p. 148.\r\n\r\n[222] Vol. ii. p. 352.

The doctors therefore held by vaccination, but\r\non modified terms; and the position to which they had been reduced\r\nis set forth in an article in the _Edinburgh Review_, for November,\r\n1822, concerning which Jenner wrote to Gardner, 13th January, 1823,\r\na week before his death--\r\n\r\n  I have an attack from a quarter I did not expect, the _Edinburgh\r\n  Review_. These people understand literature better than physic.\r\n  It will do incalculable mischief. I put it down at 100,000 deaths\r\n  at least. Never was I involved in so many perplexities.\r\n\r\nWhat an extraordinary article! working mischief incalculable,\r\nand bad for at least one hundred thousand deaths! A criticism in\r\nthe _Quarterly_ is said to have killed Keats, upon which Byron\r\nremarked--\r\n\r\n      ’Twas strange the mind, that very fiery particle,\r\n      Should let itself be snuffed out by an article.\r\n\r\nIf, however, Jenner was right, it will be allowed, I think, that\r\nthe murder of a poet was exceeded in atrocity by the slaughter\r\nof at least one hundred thousand ordinary mortals. Wherefore,\r\nto discover the manner of the great iniquity, I looked up the\r\n_Edinburgh Review_ and discovered the diabolical article. It is\r\nentitled “Vaccination and Smallpox”; is obviously written by the\r\neditor, Jeffrey; and the rock of offence was at once apparent.\r\nDoubt is thrown on the efficacy of vaccination to prevent smallpox;\r\n_ergo_, vaccination thus discredited will be neglected; _ergo_,\r\nvaccination thus neglected will enlarge the domain of smallpox;\r\n_ergo_, at least one hundred thousand persons will perish. Q.E.D.\r\nBut it will be asked, “What did Jeffrey say?” The article thus\r\nopens--\r\n\r\n  Vaccination, we are perfectly persuaded, is a very great blessing\r\n  to mankind; but not quite so great a blessing, nor so complete\r\n  a protection, as its early defenders conceived it to be. The\r\n  proof of this has been admitted with great reluctance; but it\r\n  has unfortunately become too strong for denial or resistance.\r\n  The first answers given to the instances of failure, with which\r\n  the friends of Vaccination were pressed, were, either that the\r\n  disease which had occurred after Vaccination was Chickenpox,\r\n  and not Smallpox; or that the process of Vaccination had been\r\n  unskilfully or imperfectly conducted; or that it was one of those\r\n  very rare cases which occurred in the times of Inoculation, and\r\n  from which Vaccination itself did not pretend to be wholly exempt.\r\n\r\nThe Report of the Vaccine Pock Institution for 1803 is cited, as\r\nfollows, to show how absolute was the confidence in vaccination in\r\nthe days of inexperience--\r\n\r\n  We have been alarmed two or three times with intelligence of\r\n  Smallpox occurring several weeks or months after our patients\r\n  had undergone the Cowpox. We thought it our duty to visit and\r\n  examine these patients, and also to inquire into their history\r\n  among their attendants, and by these means we obtained the\r\n  completest satisfaction that the pretended Smallpox was generally\r\n  the Chickenpox.\r\n\r\nAs time went on, cases of smallpox after vaccination kept\r\nmultiplying, and the various excuses to account for their\r\noccurrence, though obstinately asserted, utterly broke down. There\r\nremained no doubt whatever that to be vaccinated in the most\r\napproved fashion afforded no guarantee against smallpox. In 1820,\r\nsaid Jeffrey, the Board of the National Vaccine Establishment was\r\ncompelled to make the following melancholy admission--\r\n\r\n  It is true that we have received accounts from different parts\r\n  of the country of numerous cases of Smallpox having occurred\r\n  after Vaccination; and we cannot doubt that the prejudices of\r\n  the people against this preventive expedient are assignable (and\r\n  not altogether unreasonably perhaps) to this cause. These cases\r\n  the Board has been industriously employed in investigating;\r\n  and though it appears that many of them rest only on hearsay\r\n  evidence, and that others seem to have undergone the Vaccine\r\n  Process imperfectly some years since when it was less well\r\n  understood, and practised less skilfully than it ought to be;\r\n  yet, after every reasonable deduction, we are compelled to allow\r\n  that too many still remain on undeniable proof, to leave any\r\n  doubt that the pretensions of Vaccination to the merit of a\r\n  perfect and exclusive security in all cases against Smallpox,\r\n  were admitted at first too unreservedly.\r\n\r\nThe significance of a confession like the foregoing is not to be\r\nestimated literally. It was exacted under irresistible pressure of\r\nfacts, numerous, definite and undeniable, after every method of\r\nexcuse and prevarication had been exhausted. In short, it was an\r\nauthoritative retractation of the flaming medical testimony with\r\nwhich vaccination had been commended to the public in 1800, when\r\nthe heads of the profession thought it their duty to declare in the\r\nnewspapers--\r\n\r\n  That those persons who have had the Cowpox are perfectly secure\r\n  from the future infection of the Smallpox.\r\n\r\nAnd of Jenner’s emphatic assurance--\r\n\r\n  That the human frame, when once it has felt the influence of\r\n  the genuine Cowpox is never afterwards, at any period of its\r\n  existence, assailable by the Smallpox.\r\n\r\nThe occasion of Jeffrey’s article was the publication by Dr. John\r\nThomson of a treatise on a violent epidemic in Edinburgh, and other\r\nparts of Scotland, in 1818-19.[224] The disease differed from\r\nordinary smallpox in respect of the smallness of the pustules,\r\nwhich contained a milky fluid, and began to dry up on the fourth or\r\nfifth day. In Thomson’s words--\r\n\r\n  The epidemic appeared to exhibit all the varieties of Smallpox\r\n  from the mildest to the most malignant; and it was curious to\r\n  observe that the mildest forms, as well as the most malignant,\r\n  were strictly vesicular eruptions, in which scarcely a trace of\r\n  purulent matter was to be seen from their commencement to their\r\n  termination.\r\n\r\nWhether this epidemic was smallpox or chickenpox, was the question.\r\nIt was chickenpox said some. It was modified smallpox said others.\r\nIt probably was chickenpox said Thomson; and if so, he argued,\r\nchickenpox should be accounted a variety of smallpox. The chief\r\ncause of uncertainty was, that the vaccinated constituted the\r\nmajority of sufferers--\r\n\r\n  Had the unvaccinated alone been attacked [wrote Thomson],\r\n  nothing, it appears to me, but the most unreasonable scepticism\r\n  could ever have suggested a doubt of the disease being genuine\r\n  Smallpox.\r\n\r\nThomson reported 556 cases in Edinburgh of which--\r\n\r\n    310 had been Vaccinated;\r\n     41 had had Smallpox; and\r\n    205 had neither been Vaccinated nor had Smallpox.\r\n\r\nAnd William Gibson, surgeon at Robert Owen’s mills, New Lanark, had\r\n322 cases, of which--\r\n\r\n    251 had been Vaccinated.\r\n     11 had had Smallpox, spontaneous or inoculated.\r\n     57 had neither been Vaccinated nor had Smallpox.\r\n      3 had had Smallpox and Cowpox simultaneously.\r\n\r\nAs is usual in epidemics of smallpox, it was the young who were the\r\nmajority of sufferers; Thomson saying--\r\n\r\n  The epidemic has been observed to attack those chiefly who were\r\n  under ten years of age; _increasing years appearing in general to\r\n  lessen the susceptibility to Smallpox contagion_.\r\n\r\nThomson supported his opinion that chickenpox and smallpox were\r\ninterchangeable varieties of variola with much cogent evidence\r\nand argument. He cited instances in which they occurred together,\r\none constitution bringing forth chickenpox where another brought\r\nforth smallpox, whilst the infection of one appeared at times in\r\nthe manifestation of the other. The controversy is not one on\r\nwhich it is necessary to pronounce judgment beyond saying that the\r\nwhole drift of philosophic pathology is now in Thomson’s favour;\r\nand indeed at the time he wrote, his position would not have been\r\nseriously contested, save for the discredit it accumulated upon\r\nvaccination. One of Thomson’s correspondents, P. Mudie, M.D., of\r\nSt. Andrews, stated the difficulty with artless force. He wrote,\r\n18th October, 1818--\r\n\r\n  Of late years I have remarked, that the disease called Chickenpox\r\n  has been much more severe than formerly; and many of the cases\r\n  occurring after Vaccination, so much resembled Smallpox, that _if\r\n  my mind had not been prejudiced against the possibility of such\r\n  an occurrence_, I should have pronounced the eruption to have\r\n  been of a variolous nature.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding his experience, Thomson held firmly by vaccination.\r\nWhilst compelled to admit that it did not avert either form of\r\nvariola, he maintained with curious fervour that it made the\r\ndisease milder, as if to excuse his partial surrender of faith. We\r\nall see more or less according to our prepossessions, and we need\r\nnot blame Thomson if with his perspicacity he was unequal to the\r\nentire truth. The vaccinated belonged to classes who were better\r\nhoused, better fed, and better cared for than the unvaccinated;\r\nand if their ailment had been measles or pneumonia in place of\r\nchickenpox, they would have all the same made better recoveries.\r\nPrecisely the same error is made at this day: what is due to\r\nkindlier conditions of life is ascribed to vaccination.\r\n\r\nSome tried to account for the manifest failure of vaccination on\r\nthe supposition that the original virus had lost its force in\r\ntransmission from arm to arm, but Thomson would not allow that it\r\nhad deteriorated. He said--\r\n\r\n  The Vaccine Virus used in Edinburgh for a series of eighteen\r\n  years produces exactly the same appearances as are delineated\r\n  by Dr. Jenner as characteristic of Cowpox. I know, also, that\r\n  the appearances of the vaccine vesicle produced by this matter,\r\n  which must have passed through a succession of at least 900\r\n  individuals, agree exactly with those exhibited by vesicles\r\n  produced by inoculation, _with the more recent equine matter with\r\n  which I have been, lately favoured by Dr. Jenner_.\r\n\r\nThe latter words are noteworthy. When Jenner’s ascription of\r\nthe origin of Cowpox in Horsegrease is referred to, the answer\r\nfrequently is, that Jenner was mistaken, and that he did not\r\npersist in his opinion. It is true that he did preserve a judicious\r\nsilence about horsegrease when he saw that it would mar rather than\r\nmake his fortune. But when he obtained all he was likely to get,\r\nhe resumed the expression of his original opinion, and used and\r\ndiffused what he described as horsegrease; and the vesicles raised\r\nby the virus, and the cicatrices which remained were identical with\r\nthose induced by so-called Cowpox.\r\n\r\nAnother point developed in Thomson’s evidence was the mistake made\r\ncrediting vaccination with the prevention of smallpox where there\r\nwas no smallpox to prevent. The victories ascribed to vaccination\r\nwere victories either over an imaginary or a retreating enemy.\r\nWe cannot too firmly insist upon this point in presence of the\r\nclaim continually advanced for the subjugation of smallpox by\r\nvaccination. For some cause undefined, and, probably in its full\r\nextent, undiscoverable, a subsidence of smallpox over the whole\r\nof Europe set in toward the close of last century, and continued\r\nduring the early years of the present; and to this subsidence the\r\nfavour that vaccination met with was largely due. The decline in\r\nthe disease concurrently with the introduction of vaccination,\r\nwas ascribed to vaccination, although the decline prevailed among\r\nan overwhelming majority who had never received vaccination. To\r\nmake good the claim for vaccination it would have been necessary\r\nto maintain that the vaccine rite, as applied to 2 or 3 per cent.\r\nof Europeans, effected the salvation of 98 or 97 per cent. For\r\nexample, a great point was made by Jenner and his friends of the\r\nextinction of smallpox in Vienna, according to the following table--\r\n\r\n                          TOTAL     FROM\r\n        YEARS.           DEATHS.  SMALLPOX.\r\n    1791-1800   average  14,600     835      or one in     17½\r\n         1801            15,181     164                    93\r\n         1802            14,522      61                   238\r\n         1803            14,383      27                   582\r\n         1804            14,035       2                 7,017\r\n\r\nYet it was never pretended that in these years more than a fraction\r\nof the Viennese were vaccinated, or that the death-rate of the city\r\nwas reduced by the disappearance of smallpox. The like fatuity\r\ncharacterised the whole of the vaccinators’ statistics. Smallpox\r\nhad declined, _therefore_, they argued, vaccination is the cause of\r\nthe decline, and multitudes were convinced by the illicit logic.\r\nWhen vaccination was, however, brought to the test of epidemic\r\nsmallpox, its inefficacy became manifest, and thus Thomson had to\r\navow, as the result of his experience in the Edinburgh epidemic of\r\n1818-19--\r\n\r\n  It is to the severity of this epidemic, I am convinced, that we\r\n  ought to attribute the greatness of the number of the vaccinated\r\n  who have been attacked by it, and not to any deterioration in the\r\n  qualities of the Cowpox Virus, or to any defects in the manner in\r\n  which it has been employed. _Had a variolous constitution of the\r\n  atmosphere_, similar to that which we have lately experienced,\r\n  _existed at the time Dr. Jenner brought forward his discovery, it\r\n  may be doubted whether it ever could have obtained the confidence\r\n  of the public_.\r\n\r\nSuch was the article which Jenner “put down for 100,000 deaths at\r\nleast.” Yet neither Jeffrey nor Thomson renounced vaccination.\r\nThey agreed that whilst it could no longer be trusted to prevent\r\nsmallpox, it made the disease milder in those it attacked. When a\r\ncherished belief is surrendered, it is rarely unconditionally: it\r\nis only by degrees that full concession is made unto truth.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[224] _An Account of the Varioloid Epidemic which has lately\r\nprevailed in Edinburgh and other Parts of Scotland; with\r\nObservations on the Identity of Chickenpox with Modified Smallpox._\r\nBy John Thomson, M.D. London, 1820. Pp. 400.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION OF VACCINATION TO THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nLeaving England for awhile, let us see how it fared with\r\nvaccination in some other countries.\r\n\r\nAs before observed, the introduction of vaccination to practice\r\nis sometimes described, as having been a labour of difficulty, a\r\nstrife with prejudice, a victory of light over darkness; but there\r\nwas nothing in reality answering to such magniloquence. The battle\r\nwas won for vaccination by variolation, for which it was exhibited\r\nas a harmless and more efficient substitute. Unless the entrance\r\nof vaccination into the place of variolation be recognised, its\r\nquick and easy triumph is inexplicable. A novelty that King George\r\nand Queen Charlotte, the Prince of Wales, and the Royal Dukes\r\naccepted without hesitation or reserve, could not in the nature of\r\nthings have required the exercise of much intelligence. Any serious\r\nresistance proceeded from the variolators, who considered their\r\ncraft in danger when parsons, women, and tradesmen were approved of\r\nas vaccinators by Jenner himself. Such opposition to vaccination as\r\nis common at this day was not possible in the early years of the\r\npresent century. We know that health is the best defence of health,\r\nand that illness is proof of ill-living; but, to our forefathers,\r\nillness was a mysterious dispensation to be encountered with\r\nsubmission, relieved by prescriptions, magical and natural. Hence\r\nnot only dull Royalty was involved in the cowpox craze, but men\r\nof science like Davy, Wollaston, and Darwin, with the whole troop\r\nof men of letters, of whom Sir Walter Scott may be taken for\r\nspokesman. Describing Queen Caroline in “The Heart of Midlothian,”\r\nhe says--\r\n\r\n  The lady had remarkably good features, though somewhat injured by\r\n  Smallpox, that venomous scourge, which each village Æsculapius\r\n  (thanks to Jenner) can now tame as easily as his tutelary deity\r\n  tamed the Python.\r\n\r\nFor credulity thus expressed there was large excuse. What else,\r\nindeed, could one in Scott’s position have been expected to\r\nbelieve? It was only through the hard disenchantment of experience\r\nthat vaccination did not prevent smallpox, nor mitigate its\r\nseverity, nor was in itself harmless, that the early delirium\r\nabated, and a less rabid persuasion supervened.\r\n\r\nThe wave of conviction spread from England over the world, and\r\nnowhere was the substitution of vaccination for variolation\r\nwelcomed more enthusiastically than in New England. As Boston led\r\nthe way in 1721 in the practice of smallpox inoculation, so from\r\nBoston in 1800 was announced the project for the extermination of\r\nsmallpox by cowpox. But ere advancing farther, it may be well to\r\nsay a word about Boston smallpox.\r\n\r\nBoston was an extremely unhealthy town. For fifty years, from 1701\r\nto 1750, the births were exceeded by the deaths. In a population\r\nof about 15,000, the annual death rate ranged from 30 to 70 per\r\nthousand. There were epidemics of fever and of smallpox; the latter\r\noccurring in general at intervals of ten years, when large numbers\r\ndied, the smallpox as usual displacing other forms of fever, but\r\nnevertheless raising the mortality of the year. The most deadly\r\noutbreak of smallpox was that of 1721, the year in which Cotton\r\nMather and Zabdiel Boylston introduced variolation. The mortality\r\nof that year was 1102, of which 884 were ascribed to smallpox.\r\nIn 1752 there was an extraordinary epidemic, but how much of its\r\nprevalence was due to circumstance and how much to contrivance,\r\nit is impossible to divine. Here are the figures, which are of\r\nsingular interest--\r\n\r\n    BOSTON in 1752. Population 15,684.\r\n\r\n                                               Died in\r\n                Had     Died.     Were      consequence of\r\n             Smallpox.         Variolated.

The deaths, 569, were less numerous than in\r\n1721, when 884 died, but the disease was more widely diffused,\r\nupwards of one-third of the inhabitants, 5545, being attacked. The\r\nepidemic exhausted itself within four months, the record standing\r\nthus--\r\n\r\n    January,  died,    1\r\n    February,  ”       2\r\n    March,     ”       2\r\n    April,     ”     119\r\n    May,       ”     205\r\n    June,     died,  203\r\n    July,      ”      31\r\n    August,    ”       5\r\n    September, ”       1\r\n                     ---\r\n                     569\r\n\r\nThe diffusion of the epidemic was largely due to the extensive\r\nvariolation that went on, no fewer than 2124 having been inoculated\r\nin the panic, and they moving freely about in the assurance of\r\nsafety, spread the distemper on every side. For every five who\r\nhad the smallpox, so to say, naturally, two had it artificially,\r\nand the one sort was almost as “catching” as the other. It was\r\nan instance of a community (excepting the 1843 who fled) rushing\r\ninto smallpox to escape from smallpox. The deaths of 24 Whites and\r\n6 Blacks from variolation gave rise to much concern, and by some\r\nthey were spoken of as so many murders. Against this fatality was,\r\nhowever, set the low death rate of the regular sufferers, 539 out\r\nof 5545, or less than 1 in 10. The Rev. T. Prince, who communicated\r\nan account of the epidemic to the _Gentleman’s Magazine_ for 1753,\r\np. 413, was puzzled to account for the variation from the London\r\nstandard--\r\n\r\n  Dr. Jurin computes that there generally die in London in the\r\n  natural way 2 in 11 or 18 in the 100; but in Boston we see that\r\n  not more than 1 in 10 died; whilst in the inoculated way the\r\n  deaths were more numerous than is commonly allowed. What were the\r\n  natural causes, under their Divine Director, of Smallpox in the\r\n  natural way being less mortal in Boston than in London, and more\r\n  mortal in Boston than in London in the inoculated way, may be\r\n  worthy of our humble inquiries.\r\n\r\nThe difference was broader than Prince perceived. An outbreak of\r\nsmallpox in which a third of the population was affected never\r\noccurred in London, and a mortality proportionate with that of\r\nBoston among a third of the Londoners would have appeared like a\r\nrecurrence of the Plague. I am in nowise concerned to minimise the\r\nravages of smallpox when conditions are prepared, as of design,\r\nfor its development; but I do insist on their accurate definition.\r\nBoston suffered severely, but was by no means “decimated”--the\r\ninvariable rhetorical phrase. The deaths were at the rate of 1\r\nin 27, and, as observed, smallpox replaced other forms of fever.\r\nThe 539 deaths from smallpox were not extra deaths; the excess\r\nwas less than half that number, and might fairly be attributed to\r\nthe extraordinary energy displayed in propagating the disease by\r\ninoculation.\r\n\r\nSpite of such adverse experience, variolation continued to be a\r\ncommon, though intermittent, practice in America, and especially in\r\nNew England, where the habit of doctoring for the cure of present\r\nailments, and the prevention of anticipated ones, was established\r\nand inveterate. In Boston the practice became systematised, and the\r\ninoculated were confined for three weeks to an hospital situated\r\non a promontory in the Charles River, where they were treated as\r\nveritable centres of infection--a course widely different from that\r\npursued in the epidemic of 1752. Nevertheless, it is not to be\r\nsupposed that smallpox was ever endemic in New England as it was\r\nin London. Dr. Waterhouse writing in 1787 observed--\r\n\r\n  I do not believe there is at present a single person infected by\r\n  Smallpox in all the four New England Governments, that is, not\r\n  one in a million of people.\r\n\r\nThe disease broke out now and then, and was always traced to some\r\nwayfarer, or ship, or parcel of goods--never to bad drainage, or\r\nno drainage, or the stenches that pervaded the domestic interiors\r\nof last century, whether in America or Europe. In this matter,\r\nthe exercise of a little imagination is requisite to realise the\r\nhistoric facts: they are disagreeable; but if people will insist\r\non comparing the smallpox of the 18th century with that of the\r\n19th, it may become necessary to be explicit as to certain domestic\r\ndetails concerning which there is a conventional reserve.\r\n\r\nIt was by Dr. Benjamin Waterhouse, Professor of the Theory and\r\nPractice of Physic in the University of Cambridge, Massachusetts,\r\nthat vaccination was introduced to America. He described the new\r\nrite in the _Columbian Centinel_ of 12th March, 1799, as “Something\r\nCurious in the Medical Line”; and formally promulgated the novelty\r\na year afterwards in a pamphlet thus entitled--\r\n\r\n  _A Prospect of Exterminating the Smallpox; being the History of\r\n  the Variolæ Vaccinæ, or Kine-Pox, commonly called the Cowpox,\r\n  as it has appeared in England: with an Account of a Series of\r\n  Inoculations performed for the Kine-Pox in Massachusetts._\r\n  Printed for the Author at the Cambridge Press by William Hilliard\r\n  and sold by him and other Booksellers in Boston. 1800.\r\n\r\nKine-Pox! Why Kine-Pox? The reason is stated by the Doctor--\r\n\r\n  From kine the plural of cow; thus in the Scriptures, “And they\r\n  took two milch-kine, and shut up their calves at home”; a word\r\n  equally expressive, and, in the opinion of some, more delicate.\r\n\r\nThere we have it: _More delicate_! If it had been bull-pox the\r\nobjection might have been insuperable. Writing to Jenner, 24th\r\nApril, 1801, Waterhouse says--\r\n\r\n  _Could you believe that not a single inoculation with Cowpox has\r\n  yet been effected in Philadelphia? It seems that the leading_\r\n  physician there pronounces it too beastly and indelicate for\r\n  polished society.[225]\r\n\r\nThe pamphlet on Kine-Pox set forth the mystery of the new\r\ninoculation as received from England with a significant\r\nomission--there was not a word in it about Horsegrease! Waterhouse\r\nwas in correspondence with Pearson, and Pearson may have told him\r\nhow not only the asserted generation of Cowpox in Horsegrease\r\nwas discredited, but “how it was like to damn the whole thing”;\r\nwhich might have been true enough, but if true, Where then stood\r\nJenner? He knew that cowpox did not prevent smallpox: the fact was\r\nnotorious among the medical men in cowpox districts: and he had\r\nexpressly pledged his faith in the _Inquiry_ to Cowpox begotten\r\nfrom Horsegrease and to nothing else. But Horsegrease Cowpox did\r\nnot suit the market, and it was withdrawn with Jenner’s tacit\r\nassent, and spontaneous Cowpox advanced in its stead, and accepted\r\nas Jenner’s veritable discovery. It might be good business to drop\r\nthe horse out of the case, but what was it else?\r\n\r\nCowpox, testified Waterhouse, was unknown in New England, but he\r\nreceived the revelation concerning it at once--but _not_, be it\r\nrepeated, Jenner’s revelation: _that_ he suppressed. He had long\r\nsuspected that smallpox was communicated from brutes to the human\r\nrace; and now his suspicion was confirmed. And, such being the\r\norigin of variola, it seemed to him not unreasonable that the\r\ndisease as it existed in a mild form in kine might be used for\r\ninoculation with all the advantages pertaining to smallpox, whilst\r\nattended with neither injury to the inoculated, nor with risk of\r\ninfection to those about them--\r\n\r\n  What makes this newly discovered disease so very curious, and so\r\n  extremely important is, that every person thus affected, is ever\r\n  after secured from the ordinary Smallpox, let him be ever so much\r\n  exposed to the effect of it, or let ever so much ripe Smallpox\r\n  matter be inserted into the skin by inoculation. In other words,\r\n  a person who has undergone the local disease and specific fever\r\n  occasioned by the Cowpox Infection is thereby rendered ever after\r\n  insusceptible of the Smallpox.\r\n\r\nHow incautious, to say the least, was the acceptance of this\r\nprophecy of perpetual security! With less than three years’\r\nexperience an absolute prediction was delivered, received, and\r\nrepeated over the whole earth as if by parrots. Such, however, is\r\nthe habit of mankind when possessed by a strong delusion.\r\n\r\nIn justice to Waterhouse it has to be said that he did not commit\r\nhimself openly until he had gone through the illusory experiments\r\nthat were then fashionable in England. He had much difficulty in\r\nobtaining a supply of active virus. Several remittances failed, but\r\nat last he had one, an inch and a-half of infected thread, from\r\nDr. Haygarth which proved, it was thought, effective.[226] His\r\nfirst patient was his son, Daniel Oliver, aged five; then another\r\nchild aged three; then a servant lad aged twelve; then a weaned\r\ninfant of one year--all five successful, whilst two domestics\r\nfailed “to take”--seven experiments in his own household. Then he\r\nhad the children taken to the Smallpox Hospital, where they were\r\ninoculated by Dr. Aspinwall, and issuing scatheless from the test,\r\nthe truth was taken as demonstrated, and there was no need for\r\nfurther hesitation. Four gentlemen, including a physician, offered\r\nthemselves for public encouragement--\r\n\r\n  One of them [says Waterhouse] chose to live pretty freely by way\r\n  of experiment, and the febrile symptoms, especially headache,\r\n  were full as much as he could bear and walk about with. This\r\n  convinced me that the Kine-Pox was a disease not to be trifled\r\n  with.\r\n\r\nWaterhouse then appealed to the pride of his countrymen--\r\n\r\n  The people of New England, particularly of Boston, set a noble\r\n  example to their elder brethren of Old England, in adopting the\r\n  Turkish practice of Inoculation for the Smallpox in 1721. Now\r\n  the English in their turn, lead the way in a practice still more\r\n  salutiferous. For though the Inoculation which commenced here in\r\n  1721, stripped that horrid disease, the Smallpox, of more than\r\n  half its terrors, yet it is the Kine-Pox that will effect its\r\n  extermination.\r\n\r\nFollowing this prophecy came a frank request for business--\r\n\r\n  Dr. Waterhouse informs those who have applied to him out of\r\n  Cambridge to inoculate their families that he declined it only\r\n  until the disorder had gone fairly through his own family, and\r\n  until some of them had been inoculated by Dr. Aspinwall, and\r\n  otherwise exposed to Smallpox. But having now confirmed his\r\n  assertion, that the Kine-Pox protects the constitution from the\r\n  infection of Smallpox by a fair experiment, he is ready to attend\r\n  them whenever they choose. Those who live in Boston may rest\r\n  assured that from the proximity of his residence to the capital,\r\n  he shall make such arrangements as to be able to attend them as\r\n  punctually as if he resided there.--CAMBRIDGE, 18th _August_,\r\n  1800.\r\n\r\nAfter an English pattern he published the following table--\r\n\r\n    NATURAL SMALLPOX.   | INOCULATED SMALLPOX.  |     KINE-POCK.\r\n  A Contagious Disease. |    Contagious.        |  Non-Contagious.\r\n                        |                       |    Never fatal.\r\n  One in 6 who take     | One in 300 dies.      | It is like crossing\r\n  it dies. It is like   | It is like crossing   | the stream on a new\r\n  an attempt to cross   | the stream in an old, | and safe bridge.\r\n  a dangerous stream    | leaky boat, where     |\r\n  by swimming, where    | one in 300 perishes.  |\r\n  one in six perishes.  |                       |\r\n\r\nThe operations, so hopefully begun, came speedily to grief. In a\r\nletter addressed by Waterhouse to Jenner, 24th April, 1801, we\r\nread--\r\n\r\n  One inch and a-half of infected thread from Dr. Haygarth was\r\n  the whole stock from whence perhaps 3000 persons have been\r\n  inoculated, _but I fear the greatest part of them have been\r\n  spurious_. I gave out that the winter was an unfavourable season\r\n  for this new inoculation, and by that means I suspended the\r\n  practice throughout the country until the arrival of fresh matter\r\n  and your letter. Now we are going on again, but not with the\r\n  faith and spirit of the last season. Some unlucky cases have\r\n  damped the ardour of a people who received this new inoculation\r\n  with a candour, liberality, and even generosity, much to their\r\n  credit. The first political and literary characters in our nation\r\n  are still warm advocates for the practice.[227]\r\n\r\nWaterhouse continued to correspond with Jenner, and was regarded\r\nas his accredited representative in New England. Writing to Dr.\r\nLettsom, 16th November, 1802, he says--\r\n\r\n  Dr. Jenner has just sent me a present I highly prize--a silver\r\n  box inlaid with gold of exquisite taste and workmanship, bearing\r\n  this inscription--\r\n\r\n      EDWARD JENNER to BENJAMIN WATERHOUSE.\r\n\r\n  But Mr. Ring annexed the superscription in rather an hyperbolical\r\n  style--\r\n\r\n      From THE JENNER of THE OLD WORLD\r\n      To THE JENNER of THE NEW WORLD.\r\n\r\n  Long will it remain among the sacræ relictæ of my family.[228]\r\n\r\nWaterhouse was a man of an ingenious turn of mind. When troubled\r\nwith ill-results from his operations at the end of 1800, he tried\r\nwhat has since been called retro-vaccination, probably for the\r\nfirst time. Here are his words from his letter to Jenner, 24th\r\nApril, 1801--\r\n\r\n  I inoculated one of my cows with the Vaccine Virus, and obtained\r\n  from her a crop of matter on the ninth day, which produced the\r\n  disease in the human subject to perfection. Is this experiment\r\n  known among you? As I operated myself there was no avenue opened\r\n  for deception in the whole experiment.\r\n\r\nA sentence which follows is too characteristic to be passed over.\r\nSays Waterhouse--\r\n\r\n  I have invariably found that weakly children have been benefited\r\n  by the Vaccine Inoculation, and some it has cured of the Hooping\r\n  Cough.\r\n\r\nAnd this after less than twelve months’ experience!\r\n\r\nWaterhouse had also to relate a case of cows having smallpox--\r\n\r\n  At one of our periodical inoculations, which occur in New\r\n  England once in eight or nine years,[229] several farmers drove\r\n  their cows to an hospital near a populous village, that the\r\n  patients might have the benefit of their milk. The cows were\r\n  milked by persons in all stages of Smallpox; and in consequence\r\n  they had an eruptive disorder on their teats and udders that\r\n  every one in the hospital, as well as the physician who told me,\r\n  declared was Smallpox. Since Cowpox has been talked of, this\r\n  account has been revived and credited. Have you found anything\r\n  like it in England?\r\n\r\nWaterhouse had inquiries from Virginia, and wished Jenner to let\r\nhim have, if possible, a picture of the vaccine vesicle on the\r\nnegro--\r\n\r\n  Could I procure two or three coloured plates, delineating the\r\n  appearances on the skin of the negro, I would send them into such\r\n  of our Southern States as are blackened by these degraded beings.\r\n\r\n“Some in this country, as well as in England,” observed Waterhouse,\r\n“having had all their objections to Kine-Pox obviated, persist in\r\nasking, ‘Who can tell what may be the consequences in the lapse\r\nof years of introducing a bestial humour into the human frame?’\r\nI answer them as does Mr. Ring with a spirit and wit worthy of\r\nFranklin, ‘Who can tell what may be the consequences in the lapse\r\nof years of introducing milk, beef steaks, or mutton chops, into\r\nthe human frame?’”\r\n\r\nThe pertinacity with which this “wit” was employed by the early\r\nvaccinators leads us to suppose that they found it effective; but\r\nwas ever argument by analogy more absurdly misapplied? Milk or\r\nsteaks from a cow, or chops from a sheep known to be suffering\r\nfrom pox would be rejected with loathing; nor was it ever proposed\r\nto cook and eat cowpox; and yet corruption, mere association with\r\nwhich, would render milk, or steaks, or chops loathsome, it was not\r\nthought abominable to infuse into the blood!\r\n\r\n“The first political and literary characters in our nation are\r\nwarm advocates of the practice,” said Waterhouse; and it was so.\r\nPresident Adams was quite of a mind with King George in that\r\nrespect; and Jefferson not only approved of the practice in common\r\nwith Queen Charlotte, but, as soon as he could obtain virus, set\r\nto work with his sons-in-law, and vaccinated their families and\r\nneighbours to the number of two hundred. There is a letter from\r\nJefferson to Jenner in 1806, which is remarkable as an absolute\r\nconfession of faith at a date when much had occurred to shake\r\nfaith. The President wrote--\r\n\r\n    MONTICELLO, VIRGINIA, _14th May, 1806_.\r\n\r\n  SIR,--I have received the copy of the evidence at large\r\n  respecting the discovery of the Vaccine Inoculation, which you\r\n  have been pleased to send me, and for which I return you my\r\n  thanks. Having been among the early converts in this part of\r\n  the globe to its efficacy, I took an early part in recommending\r\n  it to my countrymen. I avail myself of this occasion to render\r\n  to you my portion of the tribute of gratitude due to you from\r\n  the whole human family. Medicine has never before produced\r\n  any single improvement of such utility. Harvey’s discovery of\r\n  the circulation of the blood was a beautiful addition to our\r\n  knowledge of the animal economy; but on a review of the practice\r\n  of medicine before and since that epoch, I do not see any great\r\n  amelioration which has been derived from that discovery. You\r\n  have erased from the calendar of human afflictions one of its\r\n  greatest. Yours is the comfortable reflection that mankind can\r\n  never forget that you have lived. Future nations will know by\r\n  history only that the loathsome Smallpox has existed, and by you\r\n  has been extirpated. Accept the most fervent wishes for your\r\n  health and happiness, and assurances of the greatest respect and\r\n  consideration.\r\n\r\n    TH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\nThat smallpox should be erased from the calendar of human\r\nafflictions, and be known only in history as extirpated by Jenner,\r\nwere vain expectations; but to recognise their vanity did not\r\nlie within Jefferson’s possibilities. He had been bred in the\r\nbelief that inoculation with smallpox prevented smallpox, and it\r\ncame forth as a corollary, that as cowpox was an equivalent for\r\nsmallpox, if all were cowpoxed, the disease must be extirpated.\r\nHis expectations, therefore, were not without plausibility. Nor\r\nwas it possible for Jefferson in the light of his time to see that\r\nsmallpox was no specific entity that could be got rid of _per\r\nse_ whilst all else remained unaffected. We know that if even\r\nvaccination made an end of smallpox, and did no harm of itself,\r\nwe should reduce neither illness nor mortality (supposing no\r\nother change in the conditions of existence were effected), but\r\nshould have our due allotment of disease in other forms. To attack\r\nsmallpox as smallpox, and suppose that if suppressed we should be\r\nin anywise advantaged, is mere illusion. Zymotic diseases, to be\r\ndealt with effectually, must be dealt with as forms of a common\r\nmalady; to get rid of one, we must get rid of all; and with a\r\ngraver sense of the difficulties to be encountered we, too, believe\r\nwith Jefferson, that smallpox may be extirpated, but in company\r\nwith much else, and by practice that has no affinity with the\r\ncreation of disease implied in vaccination.\r\n\r\nOf all people the English are most abandoned to medical quackery,\r\nsaid Lady Mary Wortley Montagu; and the English characteristic was\r\nreproduced and exaggerated in New England. The first resistance to\r\nvaccination being overcome, there was a run upon the practice--\r\n\r\n  The zeal of American medical men [says Baron] was excited to\r\n  an unparalleled degree; but, unfortunately, their discretion\r\n  did not keep pace with it. They disregarded the cautions of Dr.\r\n  Waterhouse, and paid no attention either to the state of the\r\n  matter with which they inoculated, or to the progress of the\r\n  pustule. It appears, likewise, that the cupidity of persons not\r\n  of the medical profession was stimulated, and the manner in which\r\n  they carried on their traffic was alike indicative of their\r\n  avarice and their ignorance. The followers of this trade obtained\r\n  the shirt-sleeves of patients which had been stiffened by the\r\n  purulent discharge from an ulcer consequent on Vaccination.\r\n  These they cut into strips, and sold about the country as\r\n  impregnated with the true Vaccine Virus. Several hundred persons\r\n  were actually inoculated with the poison, which, in several\r\n  cases, produced great disturbance in the constitution. A vessel\r\n  arrived from London at Marblehead with a sailor on board, who\r\n  was supposed to have Cowpox: matter was taken from him, and was\r\n  used extensively. It was soon discovered that Smallpox matter\r\n  had been employed, and _that_ disease spread rapidly through\r\n  the neighbourhood. These blunders, it is to be feared, were not\r\n  confined to vagrant quacks, inasmuch as medical men were not\r\n  quite blameless.[230]\r\n\r\nWhilst such doings discredited vaccination in one way, they served\r\nit in another: they made it easy to conceal its failures and\r\ninjuries by ascribing them to the use of spurious virus. Everything\r\nis to be gained for truth in the question of vaccination by taking\r\nit in what its believers allow to be its unexceptionable form, so\r\nas to leave no room for evasion. Smallpox in America as in England\r\nsoon showed itself indifferent to the art of the vaccinator, and\r\nthen it was settled that at least it made the disease milder; and\r\nunder cover of the convenient fiction, it continued to be practised\r\nwhere fees were to be had for the performance.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the medical mind to epidemics, and the ignorance\r\nof what we now regard as the first elements of sanitary science,\r\nare illustrated with touching sincerity in a letter addressed by\r\nDr. Waterhouse, in 1817, to the surgeons of the United States army.\r\nSaid the Jenner of the New World--\r\n\r\n  You need not waste your time, or distract your attention by\r\n  guessing at the remote causes of dysenteries or epidemic fevers.\r\n  We learn from the highest authority, that the pestilence “walketh\r\n  in darkness.” The enemy approaches unseen. We are pretty well\r\n  convinced that epidemic fevers depend not on any of those changes\r\n  in the air that are pointed out by the thermometer, barometer, or\r\n  hygrometer. These wide-spreading maladies, as well as endemics,\r\n  or local disorders, seem as if they arose from some secret\r\n  movements, or alterations in the earth, or on its surface--that\r\n  is, on some new combinations in the soil, or some effluvium\r\n  from a deeper situation, affecting not only the air we breathe,\r\n  but the water which we use for everything. Epidemics seem to\r\n  accompany or follow a blighted state of vegetation. They seem\r\n  also to accompany an abundant harvest; but whether in the series\r\n  of cause and effect is not fully known. As to myself, I’m weary\r\n  of conjecture.\r\n\r\nWell might he be weary! He does not say so, but neither does he\r\nmake any reserve in favour of vaccination; and, after seventeen\r\nyears’ trial of it, the old physician must have included it in his\r\ncry of _Vanitas Vanitatum!_\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[225] Baron’s _Life of Jenner_, vol. i. p. 442.\r\n\r\n[226] “It was Dr. Lettsom who first sent the Vaccine Lymph across\r\nthe Atlantic, and consigned it to the fostering care of his friend\r\nDr. Waterhouse.”--Pettigrew’s _Life of Lettsom_, vol. i. p. 121.\r\n“Dr. Waterhouse at length succeeded in getting some Cowpox matter\r\nfrom Dr. Haygarth of Bath, who forwarded it from Bristol.”--Baron’s\r\n_Life of Jenner_, vol. i. p. 386.\r\n\r\n[227] Baron’s _Life of Jenner_, vol. i. p. 440.\r\n\r\n[228] Pettigrew’s _Life of Lettsom_, vol. iii. p. 405.\r\n\r\n[229] As Dimsdale advised, the inhabitants of a village or district\r\nwere inoculated with Smallpox simultaneously, so that all being\r\ninfected none should be unwillingly infected!\r\n\r\n[230] Baron’s _Life of Jenner_, vol. i. p. 387.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION OF VACCINATION TO INDIA AND THE EAST.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe enthusiasm for cowpox in England was reproduced with fury among\r\nthe English in India. It is always so. What is the fashion at home\r\nis an intenser fashion abroad.\r\n\r\nWhen we say India, we speak as of a country when we are dealing\r\nwith a continent--of not one but many peoples, of races numerous\r\nand tongues various: wherefore, in naming India, I would be\r\nunderstood as limiting my remarks to the portion designated, and\r\nto the population affected by English influence. In several parts\r\nof India smallpox is endemic--begotten in permanently unwholesome\r\nconditions of life, and cultivated and propagated by inoculation.\r\nWhen, therefore, it was heard that cowpox might be substituted for\r\nsmallpox, and that the mild served every purpose of the severe\r\ndisease, there arose a demand among the English for the virus,\r\nalike for their own and for native use. Dr. Underwood, writing to\r\nJenner from Madras, 28th Feb., 1801, observed--\r\n\r\n  I have read with very great pleasure your publications on Cowpox,\r\n  and feel particularly anxious to introduce and extend it in this\r\n  country, under the greatest confidence that it would save many\r\n  lives. I have hitherto embraced every opportunity of inoculating\r\n  with variolous matter, but the loss of a beautiful little patient\r\n  has humbled me, and I confess I never now take up a lancet but\r\n  with fear and trembling.[231]\r\n\r\nIt was easier to ask than to obtain. There was no cowpox to be\r\nheard of in India, and the long voyage round the Cape, and the\r\ntropical heat were fatal to its transmission. Repeated attempts\r\nwere made, but all ended in failure. Jenner proposed to place a\r\nnumber of picked men on board an East Indiaman, and to have them\r\nsuccessively vaccinated in the course of the voyage, so as to\r\nland with fresh virus in Bombay or Calcutta; but the East India\r\nCompany declined the proposal. An attempt was then made to raise\r\na subscription for the purpose, Jenner putting his name down for\r\n1,000 guineas; though it was difficult to imagine where the 1,000\r\nguineas were to come from, unless out of the pockets of some of his\r\nadmirers.[232]\r\n\r\nThese efforts were, however, superseded by the energy and ingenuity\r\nof Dr. De Carro, of Vienna. Lord Elgin, British ambassador to the\r\nPorte, had made acquaintance with De Carro, and had received virus\r\nfrom him with which his infant son and others were vaccinated at\r\nConstantinople. The news spreading abroad, Lord Elgin was entreated\r\nto meet the Indian demand, sending the vaccine overland to Bombay\r\nby way of Bagdad and Bussora. He made several futile attempts, and\r\nthereon determined to place the matter in the hands of De Carro;\r\nand for that purpose addressed himself to the Hon. Arthur Paget,\r\nBritish ambassador at Vienna, saying--\r\n\r\n  I have so many applications for Vaccine Virus from Bussora, the\r\n  East Indies, and Ceylon, that I beg you will immediately apply to\r\n  Dr. De Carro, and request him to send some by every courier.[233]\r\n\r\nDe Carro accepted the commission with alacrity. He had already had\r\nan application from Bagdad, and, dismissing the vehicles which\r\nhad been tried and failed, such as lancets of steel, silver,\r\ngold, and ivory, and threads enclosed in quills, he saturated\r\nlint with virus, and, placing it between glasses, in one of which\r\nwas a cavity for its reception, tied them together, sealed the\r\nedges, and, taking them to a wax chandler, had them dipped until\r\nenclosed in a ball of wax, which was packed in a box stuffed\r\nwith shreds of paper. In this manner virus was conveyed through\r\nConstantinople, across the deserts to Bagdad, where it was received\r\non 31st March, 1802, still liquid, and was used “with complete\r\nsuccess.” The like success was reported from Bussora, Muscat, and\r\nBushire. From Bussora virus was conveyed to Bombay, arriving,\r\nafter a three weeks’ voyage, early in June. Twenty or thirty were\r\ninoculated with the Vienna virus, but only one “took,” namely, Anna\r\nDusthall, a child about three years of age, who was operated upon\r\nby Dr. Helenus Scott. The progress of the case was watched with\r\nintense anxiety, and correspondent satisfaction when the symptoms\r\ndeveloped according to the recognised description. On the eighth\r\nday five children were vaccinated from Dusthall’s arm, and loud\r\nwas the rejoicing when it was known that for India was secured\r\nthe genuine Variolæ Vaccinæ. From Bombay “the precious fluid” was\r\nin due course conveyed to Ceylon, Madras, Calcutta, and wherever\r\nEnglish influence prevailed. De Carro was naturally elated with his\r\nsuccess. The virus he transmitted was originally obtained from the\r\nstock of Dr. Sacco, of Milan, who had it off some Lombard cows.[234]\r\n\r\nJenner wrote to De Carro to congratulate him, 28th March, 1803--\r\n\r\n  Since the commencement of our correspondence, great as my\r\n  satisfaction has been in the perusal of your letters, I do not\r\n  recollect when you have favoured me with one that has afforded\r\n  me pleasure equal to the last. The regret I have experienced at\r\n  finding that every endeavour to send the Vaccine Virus to India\r\n  in perfection has again failed, is scarcely to be described to\r\n  you; judge, then, what pleasure you convey in assuring me that my\r\n  wishes are accomplished.[235]\r\n\r\nThe imported cowpox was diffused and recommended with energy\r\nand with fraud. Jenner, writing to Dunning, 2nd November, 1804,\r\nobserved--\r\n\r\n  Conceiving it might be a gratification to you to see how\r\n  systematically they manage vaccine affairs in India, I have sent\r\n  you a copy of a paper just transmitted to me from the India\r\n  House. Would to Heaven we could boast of such arrangements here!\r\n\r\nHere is the paper which sets forth the energetic policy pursued--\r\n\r\n    FORT-WILLIAM, _15th January, 1804_.\r\n\r\n  With a view of extending the practice of Vaccine Inoculation\r\n  throughout the East India Company’s territories in India,\r\n  the Governor-General in Council of Bengal has appointed a\r\n  Superintendent-General of Vaccine Inoculation at the Presidency,\r\n  and established subordinate superintendents at several of the\r\n  interior stations of the country; namely, at Decca, Moorshedabad,\r\n  Patna, Benares, Allahabad, Cawnpore, and Farruckabad. These\r\n  superintendents are the surgeons of the stations, and are to\r\n  act under the orders of the Superintendent-General in whatever\r\n  regards Vaccine Inoculation. The civil surgeons also at the\r\n  several judicial and revenue stations are to co-operate with\r\n  these superintendents for the purpose of forwarding the general\r\n  object.\r\n\r\n  Vaccine Inoculation has also been introduced with success\r\n  into Prince of Wales Island, and it is intended to extend the\r\n  practice to Malacca and other places to the eastward; and a\r\n  confident expectation is entertained that the benefits of this\r\n  valuable discovery will be diffused throughout Asia. It is even\r\n  in contemplation to extend it to China; but as the suspicious\r\n  disposition of the Chinese might possibly ascribe any attempt to\r\n  introduce this novel practice to sinister motives, it has been\r\n  postponed until the opinion of the Company’s servants there can\r\n  be obtained.\r\n\r\nMuch of this policy was due to the Marquis Wellesley, the\r\nGovernor-General, whose habit it was to convert conviction without\r\ndelay into performance. To what extent it was found practicable to\r\nsubstitute vaccination for variolation among the natives does not\r\nclearly appear. It was comparatively easy to operate upon those\r\nimmediately dependent upon their conquerors; but it was a different\r\nmatter to disarm the aversion of the external myriads. Supposing\r\nthe variolators preferred their ancient practice because it was\r\nmore lucrative, a number of them were brought to Calcutta, and\r\ninquiry made as to the amount of their gains, which ascertained,\r\nthey were offered double pay if they would adopt vaccination.\r\nThe offer was readily accepted, and other variolators, hearing\r\nof it, volunteered their services on similar terms, and were\r\ninstructed and enrolled as official vaccinators. A declaration was\r\ndrawn up and signed by twenty-six of these converted variolators,\r\nrecommending vaccination to the Eastern world. The declaration was\r\npublished in the _Calcutta Gazette_, printed in four languages, and\r\nwidely circulated throughout India.[236]\r\n\r\nSo much was possible to Government; but other means of persuasion\r\nwere not neglected. It was at first imagined that pox from the\r\ncow would exactly suit people who held that animal in reverence;\r\nbut, on the contrary, the fact was converted by the Brahmins into\r\nan argument against its use, they contending, and justly, that\r\ncowpox was impure. To meet this difficulty, various pious frauds\r\nwere attempted. It was pretended that vaccination was no novelty\r\nin India, and that it was known, sanctioned, and practised from\r\ntime immemorial. Baron, Jenner’s biographer, relates these details\r\nwithout animadversion--\r\n\r\n  A native physician of Bareilly put into the hands of Mr. Gillman,\r\n  who was surgeon at that station, some leaves purporting to be\r\n  an extract from a Sanscrit work on medicine, entitled “Sud’ha\r\n  Sangreha,” by a physician named Mahadeva, to this effect--\r\n\r\n  “Take the matter of pustules, which are naturally produced on the\r\n  teats of Cows, carefully preserve it, and before the breaking out\r\n  of Smallpox make with a fine instrument a small puncture (like\r\n  that made by a gnat) in a child’s limb, and introduce into the\r\n  blood as much of that matter as is measured by a quarter of a\r\n  ratti. Thus the wise physician renders the child secure from the\r\n  eruption of the Smallpox.”\r\n\r\nThe Sanscrit work from which this passage was asserted to be\r\ntaken was never forthcoming, and by competent authorities was\r\npronounced “nothing more than a well-meant device for the reduction\r\nof ignorant prejudices,” the native physician who put the leaves\r\ninto the hands of Mr. Gillman being included in the fiction. Baron\r\ncontinues--\r\n\r\n  In order to overcome these native prejudices the late Mr. Ellis,\r\n  of Madras, who was well versed in Sanscrit literature, actually\r\n  composed a short poem in that language on Vaccination. The poem\r\n  was written on old paper, and was said to have been _found_, that\r\n  the impression of its antiquity might assist the effect intended\r\n  to be produced on the minds of the Brahmins while tracing the\r\n  prevention to their sacred cow.\r\n\r\n  The late Mr. Anderson, of Madras, adopted the very same\r\n  expedient, in order to deceive the Hindoos into a belief that\r\n  Vaccination was an ancient practice of their own. It is scarcely\r\n  necessary to observe that had any authentic record of such a\r\n  practice existed these gentlemen would never have resorted to\r\n  such contrivances to gain their object.[237]\r\n\r\nThese impostors were not priests, but medical men; not Jesuits, but\r\nProtestants; not Levantines, but Englishmen in the service of the\r\nHonourable East India Company. To what extent their frauds were\r\noperative is not related. They were probably too contemptuous of\r\nnative acumen. For good and for evil the Hindoo listens to English\r\nadvice courteously and without contradiction, but persists in his\r\naccustomed way of life with the equanimity of indifference. That\r\nvaccination was an ancient practice in India came to be repeated\r\nin Europe and seriously believed, when, Jenner’s originality being\r\nimpugned, the truth came out, that old Indian vaccination was a\r\ndevice limited to Indian circumstances, and never designed for\r\nWestern acceptance.\r\n\r\nIn Madras vaccination was practised with much energy. Jenner,\r\nwriting on 7th May, 1808, said, “Wonderful to relate, the numbers\r\nvaccinated in that Presidency in the course of last year amount\r\nto 243,175.”[238] In Bombay it was claimed that smallpox was\r\nextirpated; Dr. Helenus Scott reporting, 5th December, 1806, that\r\n“in this island, swarming with mankind, no loss from smallpox has\r\nbeen suffered for several years since the introduction of vaccine\r\ninoculation.”[239] It was not pretended that all the inhabitants\r\nof Bombay had been vaccinated, or even a considerable portion of\r\nthem; but the early vaccinators appear to have regarded vaccination\r\nas a sort of charm, the possession of which kept off smallpox;\r\nthat by the vaccination, say, of one-tenth of any population,\r\nthe unvaccinated nine-tenths were protected. This faith in the\r\nvicarious efficacy of vaccination was not expressly avowed, but\r\nwas implied in the numerous reports of extirpated smallpox in\r\ncircumstances where no attempt was made, or was indeed possible, to\r\neffect universal vaccination.\r\n\r\nConfuted and frustrated in England, it was Jenner’s habit to sigh,\r\nand turn from his ungrateful country to the vast realms of Europe\r\nand Asia and America. Writing to Dunning, on 23rd December, 1804,\r\nhe observed--\r\n\r\n  Foreigners hear, with the utmost astonishment, that in some parts\r\n  of England there are persons who still inoculate for Smallpox.\r\n  It must, indeed, excite their wonder when they see that disease\r\n  totally exterminated in some of their largest cities and in\r\n  wide-extended districts around them.\r\n\r\nMark the words--Smallpox totally exterminated in some of the\r\nlargest cities in 1804; that was to say, after, _at the utmost_,\r\nfive years’ acquaintance with vaccination! A miraculous time--was\r\nit not? Jenner went on--\r\n\r\n  Let us not, my friends, vex ourselves too much at what we see\r\n  here. Let us consider this country as but a speck when compared\r\n  with the wide surface of our planet, over which, thank God!\r\n  Vaccinia has everywhere shed her influence. From the potentate\r\n  to the peasant, in every country but this, she is received\r\n  with grateful and open arms. What an admirable arrangement is\r\n  that made by the Marquis of Wellesley, the Governor-General of\r\n  India, for the extermination of the Smallpox in that quarter of\r\n  the globe! Contrasted with our efforts here, what pigmies we\r\n  appear.[240]\r\n\r\n_Omne ignotum pro magnifico est._ What inference worth a straw\r\ncould Jenner or anyone else draw from the introduction of\r\nvaccination to India? The number of the various Indian peoples\r\nwas unknown; and the periods and prevalence of smallpox among\r\nthem; also the extent to which they practised variolation. In the\r\nabsence of such elementary information, tales of the triumphs of\r\nvaccination in India were so much romance.\r\n\r\nSo far as vaccination displaced variolation, it might be taken\r\nas the substitution of a less evil for a greater; and much is\r\naccounted for in some of the early records of vaccination when it\r\nis remembered that the new practice was welcomed as a deliverance\r\nfrom the inconveniences and horrors of the old; and that the\r\ndiscredited practice was frequently abandoned without resort to\r\nits successor. A cessation of variolation was a cessation of the\r\nculture and diffusion of smallpox; and vaccination had often the\r\ncredit of the reduction of smallpox when the credit was due to\r\nthe abatement of variolation. As to the propagation of smallpox by\r\nvariolation, no one was more emphatic than Jenner, as for example--\r\n\r\n  Where Variolous Inoculation is put in practice, Smallpox must\r\n  necessarily spread.[241]\r\n\r\n  Smallpox will never be subdued so long as men can be hired to\r\n  spread the contagion by Inoculation.[242]\r\n\r\nIf then it be taken as conceded that variolation spread smallpox\r\nwherever practised, can it be fair to omit the consideration of\r\nthe consequences of its abatement when estimating the results\r\nof the introduction of vaccination? Yet scarcely an advocate of\r\nvaccination permits the fact to enter into his reckoning!\r\n\r\nThe gratitude of the English in India to Jenner did not evaporate\r\nwithout substantial expression. A subscription was started, and\r\nbetween 1806 and 1812 he received remittances to the amount of\r\n£7,383, the contributors being--\r\n\r\n    Bengal,    £4,000\r\n    Bombay,     2,000\r\n    Madras,     1,383\r\n\r\nAn amusing instance of Jenner’s ignorance of India is found in\r\na letter to Dunning, 14th March, 1807, wherein he ascribes his\r\nEnglish money from India to the gratitude of Hindoo women--\r\n\r\n  You will be pleased to hear that the _dingy_ Hindoo ladies are\r\n  convincing me of their grateful remembrance, not merely in\r\n  words, but by a _tangible_ offering, while my _fair_ Christian\r\n  countrywomen pass me unheeded by.[243]\r\n\r\nJenner, in returning thanks to Dr. Fleming, of Calcutta, for the\r\nfirst remittance of cash in 1806, took occasion to communicate some\r\nEnglish news, which is not without interest at this day. He wrote--\r\n\r\n  To say the truth, this country has been dreadfully supine in\r\n  the matter of Vaccination hitherto. Some pamphlets, full of the\r\n  grossest misrepresentations and forgeries, have been spread; and\r\n  the common people became so terrified, particularly when told\r\n  that their children, if vaccinated, would take the similitudes of\r\n  bulls and cows, that a great dislike to the practice has arisen\r\n  among them; and these accounts have been circulated through the\r\n  country with peculiar industry. The consequence has been the\r\n  re-introduction of Variolous Inoculation, which has produced an\r\n  epidemic Smallpox through the metropolis and the whole island,\r\n  except in those parts where Vaccination had previously been so\r\n  generally adopted as to forbid its approach. This, now too late,\r\n  has opened their eyes, and they see the powers of the Cowpox. The\r\n  folly of the oppositionists has gone so far as to exhibit prints\r\n  of children undergoing transformation from the human being into\r\n  that of the brute.[244]\r\n\r\nThese prints were, many of them, intended for fun, and could have\r\nno serious influence. The decline of faith in vaccination was due\r\nto the general discovery that it did _not_ prevent smallpox, and\r\nthat it _did_ excite other ailments. “It made smallpox milder”\r\nwas the apology even then coming into vogue. As for the epidemic\r\nof smallpox raised in London and the whole island by the neglect\r\nof vaccination and a return to variolation, it was a creation of\r\nJenner’s fancy. There was less smallpox in London in 1806 than in\r\n1805; but if there was not more, the bold Jennerian would answer,\r\nthere _ought_ to have been, and it could only be through the mercy\r\nof Providence that there was not.\r\n\r\nThroughout the century, the English in India have spared no pains\r\nto diffuse and enforce vaccination among the inhabitants, numerous\r\nmedical men finding place and pay in the futile occupation.\r\nSmallpox can only be overcome by systematic sanitation, which is\r\nlaborious and difficult; and among peoples whose conditions and\r\nhabits of life freely generate zymotic disease, vaccination is\r\nas likely to be effective as any other sort of incantation. Sir\r\nRichard Temple states the position at this day in these words--\r\n\r\n  Smallpox is universally prevalent in India, carrying off tens\r\n  of thousands of victims, children especially, in almost every\r\n  province year by year, and impairing or disfiguring others for\r\n  life. The Government has for many years made persistent efforts\r\n  to arrest the disease by means of Vaccination, with remarkable\r\n  success in some districts, like that of Kumaon in the Himalayas,\r\n  but generally with indifferent success, and often without any\r\n  perceptible result. The practice of Vaccination not being in\r\n  vogue, Inoculation used to be largely adopted by the natives in\r\n  many districts, but has now been prohibited, though not always\r\n  prevented actually. The State everywhere undertakes or encourages\r\n  Vaccination. Hundreds of native vaccinators are employed, and\r\n  returns are rendered of large numbers of persons said to be\r\n  successfully vaccinated. Nevertheless Smallpox appears again and\r\n  again with terrible manifestations before the people, and causes\r\n  them to disbelieve the efficacy of Vaccination.[245]\r\n\r\nWe now come to Ceylon, in which vaccination was held to have had\r\na perfect triumph. “To Sweden and to Ceylon,” says Baron, “Dr.\r\nJenner was in the habit of pointing when he wished to prove what\r\nhis discovery might accomplish; or when he lamented that fatal\r\nobstinacy of his fellow-creatures which, with such examples\r\nbefore them, could induce them to reject blessings within their\r\nreach.”[246] Sweden we shall discuss in another chapter, and of\r\nCeylon I may observe that a portion of the island was taken by the\r\nBritish from the Dutch in 1795, and that in several parts it was\r\nextremely unhealthy. Smallpox was a frequent and deadly epidemic,\r\nbut to what extent there is no evidence save hearsay and estimates\r\nfrom hearsay. The Dutch did not concern themselves with the health\r\nof the natives, but when the English took over their settlements in\r\n1800 in the midst of a severe epidemic, they opened hospitals for\r\nsmallpox and for inoculation with smallpox under the supervision\r\nof Dr. Christie.[247] He, hearing the glad tidings of vaccination,\r\nresolved to introduce the practice, and having in 1802 received\r\nvirus from Dr. Scott, of Bombay, he set to work with systematic\r\nenergy and perseverance. Supported by the authority of successive\r\nGovernors, he closed the hospitals, forbade variolation, organised\r\na staff of vaccinators, and kept them employed, until the greater\r\npart of the population under English influence was vaccinated. In\r\nthe words of Moore, writing in 1816--\r\n\r\n  At length the priesthood submitted to Vaccination, the last to\r\n  adopt this innovation upon their ancient customs; and the remains\r\n  of the Smallpox were happily extinguished in all that part of the\r\n  island which belonged to Great Britain.[248]\r\n\r\nThat smallpox had been exterminated by vaccination in Ceylon was\r\nset forth by vaccinators as something indisputable; but there were\r\ntwo observations to make--first, that smallpox was often suppressed\r\nin the sense that for a time there was no smallpox in a certain\r\npopulation, and especially subsequent to a severe epidemic; and\r\nsecond, that variolation was suppressed. Granted that smallpox\r\nceased in Ceylon coincidently with the introduction of vaccination,\r\nit may be fairly held that the exhaustion induced by the preceding\r\nepidemic, and the cessation of variolation, were sufficient to\r\naccount for the phenomenon. What remains to be said of Ceylon, I\r\nshall leave Dr. George Gregory, physician of the London Smallpox\r\nand Vaccination Hospital, to say for me. He wrote--\r\n\r\n  Ceylon was the British colony where the Government earliest\r\n  interfered and most vigorously encouraged the practice of\r\n  Vaccination. Salaried vaccinators were scattered over the\r\n  whole island. So successful were their labours, that up to the\r\n  beginning of 1819, it had often been said that the experiment of\r\n  exterminating Smallpox had been made and successfully carried out\r\n  in Ceylon. In July, 1819, however, a severe epidemic Smallpox\r\n  broke out there. In 1830 a second epidemic overspread the\r\n  island--in 1833 a third, and in 1836 a fourth. In these four\r\n  epidemics, 12,557 persons were attacked, of whom 4,090 died,\r\n  being at the rate of 33 per cent., or one out of every three.\r\n\r\n  In each of these epidemics a certain number of vaccinated\r\n  persons took Smallpox. The proportion of the vaccinated to the\r\n  unprotected varied. In the third epidemic, out of a total of 460\r\n  attacked, 341 represented themselves as vaccinated.[249]\r\n\r\nVaccination was introduced to China from the English factory at\r\nCanton, and Sir George Staunton translated into Chinese a tract on\r\nCowpox, and had it printed at Canton in 1805, the translator’s name\r\nand the foreign origin of the practice being suppressed. Jenner,\r\nwriting to Dunning, 10th December, 1806, said--\r\n\r\n  From Canton I have a most curious production--a pamphlet on\r\n  Vaccination in the Chinese language. Little did I think, my\r\n  friend, when our correspondence first began, that Heaven had in\r\n  store for me such abundant happiness. May I be grateful!\r\n\r\nThe Chinese had their own system of variolation, namely, the use\r\nof pulverised smallpox scabs as snuff; but some of them accepted\r\nvaccination, tried it, and dropped it when they found it did not\r\nkeep off the disease as warranted. Smallpox in China is almost\r\nexclusively a disease of childhood, and is little dreaded. Dr. D.\r\nF. Rennie, medical officer to the British Embassy at Peking in\r\n1861-62, says of that city--\r\n\r\n  Since 1820 vaccination (introduced from Canton) has been\r\n  practised to a limited extent among the population--probably\r\n  one-fifth may be vaccinated. At one time it was believed to\r\n  afford protection, Smallpox not having been so common immediately\r\n  after its introduction. Of recent years, however, confidence in\r\n  it has considerably diminished, owing to the frequency with which\r\n  those are attacked who have been vaccinated.[250]\r\n\r\nPersia was sometimes referred to in the ravings that went on as\r\nto the triumphs of vaccination in the East; but what was known\r\nof Persia? The practice was introduced where Europeans were\r\nresident, but it never became general. Dr. C. J. Willis has\r\nrecently described surgery and medicine in Persia as extremely\r\nrude and superstitious, and that “vaccination is not in favour,\r\nwhilst inoculation, or the direct communication of the disorder,\r\nby placing the patient in the same bed with one suffering from\r\nsmallpox of the most virulent type, is the method pursued.”[251]\r\n\r\nIt was natural enough for Jenner, in presence of failure and\r\ncontempt in England, to appeal to success in the East, and to try\r\nto overwhelm his adversaries with evidence which they could not\r\novertake; but any one of judicial temper must have perceived that\r\nif vaccination was to be vindicated, data of a very different order\r\nwould have to be forthcoming. Where the number of the population\r\nin a distant region was unknown, where the ordinary prevalence\r\nof smallpox among the people was undefined, where the extent of\r\nartificial variolation was unspecified, and the existence and\r\nintensity of related forms of zymotic disease were undescribed,\r\nwhat conclusion could be drawn as to the efficacy of vaccination\r\nthat a man of science was bound to respect? Why should certain\r\nknowledge in England be surrendered for assertion from abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[231] Baron’s _Life of Jenner_, vol. 1. p. 410.\r\n\r\n[232] Baron’s _Life of Jenner_, vol. i. p. 409.\r\n\r\n[233] _Ibid._ vol. i. p. 419.\r\n\r\n[234] _Histoire de la Vaccination en Turquie et l’Orient._ Par Jean\r\nde Carro.

We have to\r\nbear in mind, however, that the way had been made straight for it\r\nby the practice of inoculation with smallpox; which practice, after\r\na struggle prolonged over many years, had become an established\r\npart of medical art, and was only limited in its application by\r\nthe inconvenience and risks that attended it. The promise of the\r\nprimitive vaccinators was, that the security which resulted from\r\ninoculation with smallpox was to be had from inoculation with\r\ncowpox, with absolute certainty, absolute safety, and absolute\r\npermanence. The argument was, that since no one could have smallpox\r\ntwice (however slight the attack), and as cowpox was a mild form\r\nof smallpox, it sufficed to be inoculated with cowpox to be safe\r\nfrom smallpox through life; and if only the infliction of cowpox\r\nwere made universal, smallpox would be extirpated. Such was the\r\nplausible doctrine; so plausible that it had only to be stated to\r\ncommand assent; whilst so great was the elation over the discovery\r\n(as much, perhaps, for deliverance from inoculation with smallpox\r\nas from smallpox itself) that it was accounted a sacred duty to\r\ndiffuse its benefits over the whole earth. Greater good on easier\r\nterms it was difficult to imagine. With a scratch of a needle one\r\nof the worst penalties attached to over-crowding, to filth, and to\r\nill-living, might be avoided and done away with for ever.\r\n\r\n      How pleasant are such sugared lies,\r\n      Deceiving by their sweetness!\r\n\r\nThe first cowpox missionaries were Dr. Marshall and Dr. Walker.\r\n£100 was teased out of the Admiralty, and £100 out of the War\r\nOffice toward their expenses, and placed on board the _Endymion_,\r\nthey proceeded, on 1st July, 1800, to the Mediterranean. At\r\nGibraltar, Minorca, and Malta, they vaccinated soldiers and\r\nsailors, first operating on orphans and foundlings to give the\r\ngallant fellows courage. Then Walker accompanied Sir Ralph\r\nAbercrombie to Egypt, from whence, after a variety of adventures,\r\nhe returned to London to serve as domestic apostle, and vex Jenner\r\nfor the remainder of his life. Marshall proceeded to Sicily and\r\nNaples. In Palermo, in the preceding year, 1799, there had been an\r\nepidemic, in which, it was said, 8,000 had perished, and Marshall\r\nappeared on the scene as a belated messenger of salvation. At\r\nNaples he had a cordial reception from the wretched Ferdinand IV.\r\nand his wretched court, who, with general indifference or enmity\r\nto what was good, were ready to show themselves gracious toward\r\ncowpox. Marshall went through the customary performances of the\r\nvariolous test and the exposure of the vaccinated to infection; and\r\nwithout further ado an hospital was opened, and all who would be\r\nsaved from smallpox were entreated to hasten and receive the new\r\ninoculation.\r\n\r\n  It was not unusual [wrote Marshall to Jenner] to see in the\r\n  morning a procession of men, women, and children, conducted\r\n  through the streets by a priest carrying a cross, coming to\r\n  the hospital to be inoculated. By such popular means, the\r\n  practice met with no opposition; and the common people expressed\r\n  themselves as certain that it was a blessing sent from Heaven,\r\n  though discovered by one heretic and practised by another.\r\n\r\nWhen Marshall was at Gibraltar, Lord Keith issued the following\r\nmemorandum to the fleet--\r\n\r\n    H.M. Ship _Foudroyant_,\r\n    GIBRALTAR BAY, _19th October, 1800_.\r\n\r\n  Any soldiers, seamen, or marines in the Fleet who may not have\r\n  had the Smallpox, and wish to avoid that dreadful malady, may,\r\n  by application to Dr. Marshall, on board the flag-ship, be\r\n  inoculated with the Cowpox, which, without pain or illness, or\r\n  requiring particular diet or state of body, or leaving any marks,\r\n  effectually excludes all possibility of the patient ever being\r\n  affected with the Smallpox.\r\n\r\n    By command of the Vice-Admiral,      PHILIP BEAVER.\r\n        To the respective Captains of the Fleet.\r\n\r\nI may observe, in passing, that there was little delay in\r\nintroducing vaccination to the British navy. Sir Gilbert Blane was\r\nurgent, Earl Spencer, first Lord of the Admiralty, acquiescent, and\r\nDr. Trotter, physician to the fleet, enthusiastic. So early as 9th\r\nDecember, 1800, Trotter was prophesying--\r\n\r\n  The Jennerian Inoculation will be deservedly recorded as one of\r\n  the greatest blessings to the navy of Great Britain that ever was\r\n  extended to it.\r\n\r\nSmallpox was one of the pests of the service. Trotter, writing 20th\r\nFebruary, 1801, said--\r\n\r\n  Within the past seven years there have been more than a hundred\r\n  instances in which the seamen have been infected; twenty having\r\n  occurred in the last six months in the Channel fleet alone.\r\n\r\nThese outbreaks were invariably referred to an origin external to\r\nthe ship; as if anywhere smallpox could have had a more congenial\r\nbreeding-place than the crew of a man-of-war! As Dr. Johnson\r\nobserved, “When you look down from the quarter-deck to the space\r\nbelow, you see the utmost extremity of human misery; such crowding,\r\nsuch filth, such stench!”[252] Incited by the enthusiastic\r\nTrotter, the medical officers of the Fleet subscribed for a gold\r\nmedal, and presented it to Jenner. On the obverse, Apollo was\r\nrepresented introducing a young seaman recovered from cowpox\r\nto Britannia, who, in return, extended a civic crown, on which\r\nwas inscribed JENNER; above were the words, _Alba nautis stella\r\nrefulsit_, and below the date, 1801. On the reverse was an anchor\r\nand over it _Georgio Tertio Rege_, and under it _Spencer Duces_.\r\nThe medal was presented to Jenner in February, 1801.\r\n\r\nThe dates are worth noting afresh. Jenner’s _Inquiry_ was published\r\nin the summer of 1798; and thus we see that within three years\r\nhis prescription for the prevention and extermination of smallpox\r\nwas adopted in a branch of the public service where obstinate\r\nconservatism was the ruling temper; and an assertion that only time\r\ncould test was accepted without hesitation as verified and certain.\r\nIf vaccination had answered to the claim made for it, the haste\r\nwherewith it was acknowledged would have been unjustifiable, and\r\nwholly unlike the struggle that truth has commonly to pass through\r\nin order to obtain supremacy in the intellect and practice of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nThe first attempts to inoculate with cowpox in France proving\r\nfutile, Dr. Woodville went over to Paris in 1800 to show in\r\npractice the method of operation. He had a warm reception, and the\r\nQuaker was overwhelmed with the exuberant attentions to which he\r\nwas subjected. In the _Moniteur_ he was described as “a learned\r\nman, animated with generous zeal, and worthy of gratitude and\r\npraise;” who had inoculated six thousand children with invariable\r\nsuccess; and that cowpox as a preventive of smallpox could only be\r\nspoken of as something miraculous. A house was opened as a vaccine\r\nstation, and men, women, and children, flocked thither to receive\r\nthe benign fluid and life-long protection from a dreadful malady.\r\n\r\nWhen the negotiations for the peace of Amiens were in progress,\r\n1802, an address was presented with much pomp to the Marquis\r\nCornwallis by the Medical Committee of the Somme, claiming\r\nbrotherhood with the physicians of England, eulogising Jenner,\r\ndenouncing his detractors, stigmatising variolators as acting\r\nneither from the love of truth nor for the glory of their\r\nprofession, but, from avarice and hatred of improvement; whilst, as\r\nthe result of numerous experiments, “the discovery made in England\r\nhad been stamped with the seal of infallibility in France.”\r\n\r\nAt first, vaccination in France was left to voluntary effort, and\r\nmade little progress in face of a strenuous resistance developed by\r\nalarmed variolators; but a severe smallpox epidemic in 1802 incited\r\nthe Government to action. A medical commission was appointed to\r\ninvestigate and report, and in 1804 it was determined to spare no\r\neffort to extend vaccination over the whole of France. A Central\r\nCommittee for Vaccination was constituted, and appeals and commands\r\nwere addressed to the clergy and officials of all orders to have\r\nthose under their authority and influence inoculated with cowpox.\r\nSome préfects were content to recommend and warn, but others\r\nadopted more vigorous measures, such as the exclusion of the\r\nunvaccinated from schools, from employment, from charities--in\r\nshort, anticipating much legislation that has come into force, or\r\nthat fanatics wish to bring into force. Nevertheless, the progress\r\nmade did not satisfy Napoleon, and seeing that until vaccination\r\nwas everywhere paid for by the State, its performance must remain\r\nirregular and perfunctory, a manifesto was issued to the effect\r\nthat his Majesty the Emperor and King had learned from the reports\r\nof the Central Committee that the preservation and increase of his\r\nvast dominions were immediately related to systematic and universal\r\nvaccination; wherefore, his Majesty, wishing to give a signal mark\r\nof his paternal solicitude for his subjects, had granted to his\r\nExcellency the Minister of the Interior, an annual special credit,\r\ndestined to provide for the expenses necessary for extending the\r\nnew practice, and for forming centres of issue of vaccine virus\r\nin twenty-four of the chief cities of the Empire--these, then,\r\nincluding Brussels, Florence, Parma and Turin. And his Majesty\r\nhad also, out of his paternal benevolence, provided annual prizes\r\nas incentives to emulation in propagating vaccination, so that\r\nthe scourge of smallpox might be completely banished from his\r\nterritories.\r\n\r\nIt would be idle to speculate as to how much serious faith lay\r\nwithin this apparent zeal for vaccination; for, as Professor\r\nSeeley observes, “Napoleon seemed to care for no opinion, though\r\nhe adopted, with studied artificial vehemence, every fashionable\r\nopinion in turn.” There might be, I dare say, something piquant to\r\nhis theatrical genius in opposing his odious contempt for human\r\nlife to the rigorous enforcement of what was considered a supreme\r\nprescription for its preservation. Jenner availed himself of the\r\nEmperor’s histrionic instinct in soliciting the release of English\r\ntravellers detained in France. To one of these occasions we owe\r\nthe artless anecdote of the arrest of Napoleon’s refusal by the\r\ninterposition of Josephine, who exclaimed, “Jenner!” The Emperor\r\npaused and said, “Jenner! ah, we can deny nothing to that man!” It\r\nis sad to relate, the favour was not reciprocated. When Jenner,\r\nat the suggestion of Baron Corvisart, appealed to the British\r\nGovernment for similar indulgence to a Frenchman, he had to report\r\nthat there was no charm in his intervention among his countrymen.\r\n\r\nThat vaccination should have a welcome in Spain was not surprising,\r\nafter its reception in Naples. The craze was universal, and\r\ndiffused through the lowest intelligences. Cowpox was introduced to\r\nMadrid with the certificate of France under that of England; and,\r\nspite of the distractions of the time, excited much attention. Mr.\r\nAllen, secretary to Lord Holland, writing to Jenner from Madrid in\r\n1803, observed--\r\n\r\n  There is no country likely to receive more benefit from your\r\n  labours than Spain; for, on the one hand, the mortality among\r\n  children from the Smallpox has always been very great; and, on\r\n  the other hand, the inoculation for the Cowpox has been received\r\n  with the same enthusiasm here as in the rest of Europe; though\r\n  I am sorry to add that the inoculation of the spurious sort has\r\n  proved fatal to many children at Seville, who have fallen victims\r\n  to the Smallpox after they had been pronounced secure from that\r\n  disease.[253]\r\n\r\nThere were philosophising doctors in Madrid who did not see why\r\ncowpox should possess a singular efficacy, and induced the King,\r\nin 1804, to order that all the children in the foundling hospital\r\nshould be inoculated with goatpox. They did not, perhaps, know that\r\nJenner had inoculated his son with swinepox, and that the child\r\nunderwent the variolous test on several occasions with impunity.\r\n\r\nThe great event in connection with Spain was the expedition of\r\nDr. Francis Xavier Balmis, physician to his Catholic Majesty. He\r\nobtained a concession to introduce vaccination to the colonies\r\nin America and Asia, and to defray expenses by freely trading in\r\nmerchandise. He sailed from Corunna, 30th November, 1803, with\r\ntwenty-two children for the propagation of virus. The Canary\r\nIslands were first visited, then Porto Rico, and at Caracas the\r\nparty divided, Don Francis Salvani proceeding to Peru and Chili,\r\nwhilst Balmis attended to Cuba and Mexico, crossing the Pacific\r\nto the Philippines with twenty-six children to maintain the\r\nsuccession of the virus, and proceeding from thence to Macao and\r\nCanton. Having circumnavigated the globe as vaccinator and trader,\r\nBalmis re-appeared in Madrid with great _éclat_, and kissed the\r\nKing’s hand on 7th September, 1806. Philanthropy and business were\r\nsuccessfully combined, for as Moore, writing in 1817, observes--\r\n\r\n  Nearly three years were nobly spent by this excellent man in\r\n  putting a Vaccine Girdle round the globe; and it is an additional\r\n  pleasure to learn that by trading during his circumnavigation, he\r\n  acquired an easy fortune. He now enjoys at Madrid the distinction\r\n  he has merited, and patronises the diffusion of Vaccination\r\n  through the Peninsula.[254]\r\n\r\nThe expedition of Balmis naturally excited much attention, and its\r\nprogress and results were described in terms of inflated rhetoric.\r\nThus, we read in Baron’s _Life of Jenner_--\r\n\r\n  The conductors of the expedition were _everywhere_ welcomed\r\n  with the _utmost enthusiasm_. It was to be expected that the\r\n  representatives of the Spanish Monarch, and all the constituted\r\n  authorities, would gladly co-operate; but it was scarcely to be\r\n  anticipated that the unenlightened minds of the Indians would so\r\n  soon appreciate the value of the mission. It is, nevertheless,\r\n  most gratifying to know that the numerous hordes which occupy\r\n  the immense tract of country between the United States and the\r\n  Spanish colonies _all_ received the precious fluid with _the\r\n  utmost readiness_. They acquired the art of vaccinating, and soon\r\n  performed the operation with great dexterity.\r\n\r\nThus not only the Spanish Americans were brought under the dominion\r\nof cowpox, but the Indians, yea, _all_ the Indians; and not\r\nreluctantly, but joyfully, and became experts in the practice of\r\nthe rite! Baron continues--\r\n\r\n  Fame had preceded the arrival of Salvani at Santa Fé. On\r\n  approaching the capital, he was met by the Viceroy, the\r\n  Archbishop, and all the civil and ecclesiastical authorities.\r\n  The event was celebrated with religious pomp and ceremonies;\r\n  and in a short time more than fifty thousand persons were\r\n  vaccinated. Similar honours awaited the expedition _throughout\r\n  its whole course_. At Quito they were greeted with boundless joy\r\n  and festivity. Such expressions well became them. The people of\r\n  Colombia, the Indians more especially, having been often scourged\r\n  by the horrid ravages of Smallpox, regarded it as the most\r\n  terrible affliction which Heaven could send them. On its first\r\n  appearance in a village, a panic seized every heart; each family\r\n  prepared an isolated hovel, to which those who were supposed to\r\n  be infected were banished. _There_, without succour, without\r\n  remedy, and with a very insufficient supply of food, they were\r\n  exposed to the alternations of a very variable climate, and\r\n  left to their fate. _In this way whole generations perished._\r\n  Under Viceroy Toledo the population of the native Indians had\r\n  amounted to 7,500,000; but at the time of the Balmis expedition,\r\n  the number was supposed to be reduced to one-fifth--that is\r\n  1,500,000.[255]\r\n\r\nIndian and savage statistics in connection with smallpox and\r\nvaccination are usually little else than exercises in imaginative\r\ndesire--less what is true than what is wished to be true, or\r\nto be taken for true. We know the difficulty of vaccinating\r\npopulations dwelling within defined limits and under highly\r\norganised governments, and we can therefore estimate the claims\r\nmade for Balmis and his partners as roving traders and quacks in\r\nthe territories occupied by Spaniards and Indians. Yet it was with\r\nyards of mythical rubbish of this sort that English vaccinators\r\ntried to divert the attention of their countrymen from the failures\r\nof vaccination within their own experience; and when worried with\r\never-recurring disasters at home, it was in turning to Mexico and\r\nPeru that Jenner professed to find consolation.\r\n\r\nDr. Sacco, of Milan, was described as “the apostle of vaccination\r\nin Northern Italy,” and “unquestionably the greatest vaccinator\r\nin the world.”[256] His operations received the sanction of the\r\nNapoleonic administration, and as early as 1801 he was appointed\r\nDirector of Vaccination to the Cisalpine Republic. “Strong\r\nmeasures,” writes Moore, “were adopted; proclamations were read\r\nfrom every pulpit; vaccination was practised in every church;\r\nand the clergy gave such effectual aid, that the Professor and\r\nhis associates in three years vaccinated 70,000 persons, and\r\nextinguished smallpox in Lombardy.”[257] In other words, the\r\nvaccination of 70,000 persons extinguished smallpox in a population\r\nof several millions! Baron enlarges the numbers, saying that Dr.\r\nSacco and his assistants in the course of eight years vaccinated\r\n1,300,000 persons; and cites a letter from Sacco, dated from\r\nTrieste, 5th January, 1808, with the following extraordinary\r\nstatement--\r\n\r\n  During eight years I reckon more than 600,000 vaccinated by my\r\n  own hand, and more than 700,000 by my deputies in the different\r\n  departments of the kingdom. I assure you, out of a population\r\n  of 6,000,000 to have vaccinated 1,300,000 is something to boast\r\n  of; and I flatter myself that in Italy I have been the means of\r\n  promoting Vaccination in a degree which no other kingdom of the\r\n  same population has equalled.[258]\r\n\r\nMoore’s 70,000 is a credible number, whatever may be thought of\r\nits vicarious operation; but Sacco’s 600,000 by his own hand\r\nin eight years! Ah, well! when we are lost in the fabulous, it\r\nis unnecessary to waste our strength in the discrimination of\r\nthe greater from the less in falsehood. Nevertheless, taking\r\nSacco’s figures, we have to observe that the vaccination of\r\n1,300,000 saved 6,000,000 from smallpox. That Italy was freed from\r\nsmallpox is true, and the exemption of the population, whether\r\nvaccinated or unvaccinated, was prolonged over nearly thirty\r\nyears. The disappearance of the disease had, however, set in\r\nbefore vaccination was heard of, but the subsidence was claimed\r\nfor Sacco, although it extended to millions of Italians who owed\r\nnothing to the new prophylactic. As already observed, from some\r\ncause undefined, the area and intensity of smallpox was signally\r\ndiminishing toward the close of last century, and this in spite of\r\nthe stimulus applied to the disease by variolous inoculation. It\r\nmay have been so stimulated as to have been worked out--forced, as\r\nit were, to exhaustion, after the habit of much else, good and bad,\r\nwhen developed to the extremity of existence.\r\n\r\nAs a grand vaccinator Dr. De Carro, of Vienna, was scarcely less\r\ndistinguished than Sacco. He was a Swiss from Geneva, who had\r\nstudied and graduated at Edinburgh, and settled in Vienna. He\r\nperformed the first vaccination on the Continent, in 1799, with\r\nvirus conveyed on a couple of threads from Dr. Pearson; and in 1802\r\nhe succeeded in transmitting the first effective virus to India.\r\nDe Carro conducted his operations with great energy and tact, and\r\nin 1802 he induced the Austrian Government to issue an ordinance\r\nconferring on vaccination Imperial sanction and recommendation.\r\nConcurrently with this activity, smallpox was abating, and _post\r\nhoc_ was converted into _propter hoc_. De Carro was credited with\r\nthe extinction of smallpox in Vienna; but as no more than a portion\r\nof the citizens had been vaccinated, Vienna thus supplied another\r\ninstance of the vicarious influence of the Jennerian rite.\r\n\r\nSacco and De Carro corresponded with Jenner, and it is worth noting\r\nthat both concurred with him in the opinion that cowpox originated\r\nin horsegrease; and, further, that horsegrease was as good against\r\nsmallpox as horsegrease cowpox itself. Indeed, Sacco set up a stock\r\nof virus derived from horsegrease, operated with it, and supplied\r\nDe Carro, who used it so freely in Vienna that, as he said, he\r\ncould not tell the vaccinated from the equinated. Writing to\r\nJenner, on 21st June, 1803, De Carro observed--\r\n\r\n  The means of making your discovery were everywhere; yet nobody\r\n  before you had the least idea of the singular connection between\r\n  the Horsegrease, the Cowpox, and the Smallpox.[259]\r\n\r\nThe favour shown for vaccination by the English Court facilitated\r\nits adoption throughout Germany; and yet it might be said the craze\r\nwent of itself, compelling patronage and exacting advocacy. The\r\nKing of Prussia opened a Royal Inoculation Institute in Berlin,\r\nand tracts and medals, speeches and sermons, were brought into\r\nrequisition to recommend the new rite. From the furore created,\r\nmany were led to believe that all Prussia was vaccinated, and as\r\nsmallpox ceased to prevail, cowpox had the credit. To vaccinate a\r\nnation, however, is far from easily accomplished, and when we refer\r\nto the official accounts, we discover that, notwithstanding great\r\nado, the numbers operated upon constituted less than a tithe of\r\nthe people. Jenner cites a report of Professor Avelin, of Berlin,\r\nin a letter to Moore, 15th February, 1812, as authority for these\r\nstatistics--\r\n\r\n  The anniversary of the invention of the Cowpox Inoculation, or\r\n  the Jennerian Feast, was celebrated very solemnly at Berlin\r\n  on 14th May. By public accounts, it appears that there were\r\n  inoculated in all the Prussian States--\r\n\r\n    In 1801         9,772\r\n       1802        17,052\r\n       1803        50,054\r\n       1804       102,350\r\n       1805        43,585\r\n\r\n  At these times the population was about 9,743,000. From 1806 to\r\n  1810 (since the horrible war and the diminution of the population\r\n  to 4,338,000) the inoculated were 160,329. Dr. Bremer alone at\r\n  the Royal Institute in Berlin inoculated 14,605. The total, as\r\n  officially and voluntarily sent to the Government, amounted to\r\n  402,720 vaccinated, but certainly one-half was not officially\r\n  mentioned. It may certainly be at least 600,000, or even\r\n  800,000.[260]\r\n\r\nSupposing a million had been vaccinated in Prussia in the course\r\nof ten years, let me ask once more, how could they have saved the\r\nremaining millions from smallpox? Yet, with knowledge of these\r\nfigures, Moore, the Director of the National Vaccine Establishment\r\nin London, did not hesitate to write--\r\n\r\n  The King of Prussia directed his children to be vaccinated,\r\n  and also issued orders that Vaccination should be immediately\r\n  employed in the Army; and the new practice encountered no\r\n  further difficulties. By which, and by the total abandonment of\r\n  Variolous Inoculation throughout Germany, the Smallpox rapidly\r\n  declined; and in a few years was extinguished in some of the\r\n  largest cities, from whose purlieus infectious diseases are\r\n  expelled with great difficulty. Thus even in Vienna, where full\r\n  four hundred persons had annually been destroyed by the Smallpox,\r\n  this mortality diminished rapidly after the introduction of the\r\n  Vaccine, and in five years absolutely ceased.[261]\r\n\r\nRussia, of course, followed suit in cowpox inoculation. At the\r\ncoronation of Alexander in Moscow in 1801 a foundling was operated\r\non, christened Vaccinoff, pensioned for life, and dispatched to St.\r\nPetersburg to serve as a source of virus for other foundlings. Then\r\nfollowed imperial decrees prescribing vaccination, and Dr. Crichton\r\nwas directed to organise a medical staff for the performance of the\r\nrite in each province of the Empire. In 1811 a ukase was issued\r\ncommanding all Russians to be vaccinated within three years. As\r\nmeasuring the possibilities of despotism in such a matter, we learn\r\nfrom Dr. Crichton that between 1804 and 1812 there were 1,235,597\r\nvaccinations performed in Russia--a similar number to that which\r\nSacco professed to have accomplished in Northern Italy in the same\r\ntime. It was estimated in Russia that of every seven children\r\nborn, one perished of smallpox, and therefore Crichton argued\r\nthe lives of 176,514 had (up to 1812) been saved by vaccination.\r\nThe calculation illustrates the facility with which the early\r\nvaccinators deceived themselves--first, as to the certainty of\r\ntheir prophylactic; second, as to its vicarious efficacy; and,\r\nthird, in assuming that a reduction in smallpox represented a\r\nreduction in mortality.\r\n\r\nFrom Crichton, too, we learn that there were anti-vaccinists in\r\nRussia in those days--\r\n\r\n  Notwithstanding the supreme order of His Imperial Majesty, that\r\n  all his subjects he vaccinated within three years, we find that,\r\n  powerful as his Majesty is, this cannot be executed. There is\r\n  a power greater than sovereignty, namely, the conscience of\r\n  religious opinions of men, and in one or two of the distant\r\n  governments there exists a peculiar religious sect belonging to\r\n  the Greek Church, who esteem it a damnable crime to encourage\r\n  the propagation of any disease, or to employ any doctors, or\r\n  to swallow any medicines under the visitations of God. Reason\r\n  has been employed in vain with these poor people; they have\r\n  been threatened with severe punishments in case they remain\r\n  refractory, but all to no purpose. You may well imagine that\r\n  no punishment has been resorted to, though threatened, and the\r\n  Government has come to the wise conclusion of leaving the dispute\r\n  to time.[262]\r\n\r\nTo complete this rapid survey of the diffusion of vaccination\r\nthroughout Europe, there remain Sweden with Finland, and Denmark\r\nwith Iceland; but as the case of Sweden is specially interesting\r\nand instructive from the fulness and precision of its vital\r\nstatistics, coupled with the claim made by vaccinators that Sweden\r\naffords irrefutable evidence of the efficacy of their prescription,\r\nI reserve it for a special chapter. There is nothing pleasanter\r\nthan finding the strongholds of one’s antagonists, capturing, and\r\noccupying them.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[252] Boswell (Croker’s Ed.) vol. vii. p. 102.\r\n\r\n[253] Baron’s _Life of Jenner_, vol. i. p. 604.

We have seen how badly Ceylon\r\nanswered to his reference; and I now proceed to inquire whether\r\nSweden served his purpose any better.\r\n\r\nThe decline of smallpox in some communities, contemporaneously\r\nwith the introduction of vaccination, might be ascribed to the\r\ncessation of inoculation with smallpox--virtually the culture of\r\nthat disease; but in Sweden little had to be accounted for in\r\nthat way. Spite of strong recommendations, variolation was rarely\r\npractised, and never became popular. The very year that vaccination\r\nwas introduced, Dr. Acksell, of Kalmer, stated in an official\r\nreport, dated 30th March, 1801, “that it is impossible to convince\r\nthe lower classes of the advantages of inoculation. Dr. Colliander\r\nand I have had it announced to the people from the pulpit, that,\r\nwe were ready to give our services, gratis, in inoculating their\r\nchildren, but not a single person applied.” And such undoubtedly\r\nwas the state of things throughout the kingdom.\r\n\r\nSweden last century was sorely afflicted with smallpox, and,\r\nconsidering the repute of variolation in other lands, it is\r\nsurprising how the people refrained from its vaunted protection.\r\nIt is thought dreadful that in London one death in ten should have\r\nbeen due to this disease, but in Sweden the ratio stood as high as\r\none in seven. To give some idea of the extent of the mischief at\r\nits highest and its lowest, let us look at eighteen years in the\r\nlatter half of the century--\r\n\r\n    Year.   Population.   Total Deaths.

Population in Northern Europe did little more than maintain\r\nexistence through several centuries against the severity of Nature,\r\nwith food scant and bad, and raiment and shelter inadequate. Of the\r\nlatter fifty years of last century, at least fifteen were years of\r\ndearth in Sweden, and consequently of increased mortality.\r\n\r\nThe chief sufferers from deficient and unsuitable food are the\r\nyoung, their suffering having form in various ailments, and among\r\nthem smallpox. I have repeatedly had to point out how smallpox is\r\nespecially an affection of childhood, and how in Scotland, for\r\ninstance, it used to be almost exclusively confined to the young,\r\nlike measles and whooping-cough. The like was true of Sweden; for\r\nof the deaths from smallpox from 1774 to 1798--\r\n\r\n     8·19 per cent. were under one year of age;\r\n    21·90  ”             between one and three;\r\n    31·77  ”               ”     three and five;\r\n    23·74  ”               ”     five and ten;\r\n\r\na total of 85·60 per cent, being mere children. Or, to put it\r\notherwise--\r\n\r\n    In 1778, when 16,607 perished, 13,096 were under ten.\r\n       1784   ”   12,453    ”      11,789       ”\r\n       1786   ”      671    ”         625       ”\r\n       1798   ”    1,357    ”       1,207       ”\r\n\r\nand so on.\r\n\r\nNow, whilst I have no wish to minimise the sadness and culpability\r\nof the mortality of the young, I have yet to maintain that its\r\nconsequences are by no means so serious to the State as when the\r\nheads of families and bread-winners are stricken down; and that\r\nit is a gross exaggeration to compare the fatality of smallpox\r\nwith that of men slain in battle. Again, we have to recollect how\r\nmany of the young die from smallpox, so to say, needlessly, from\r\ninattention and malpractice. This was clearly recognised in a Royal\r\nLetter issued from Stockholm in 1763, recommending variolation,\r\nin which the Medical Board was directed “to instruct the common\r\npeople how children should be treated when suffering from natural\r\nsmallpox,” assigning the cogent reason, “because many more children\r\ndie from want of care than from the disease.” The assertion may\r\nbe taken as indisputable; and, being true, it stands for the fact\r\nthat the mortality from smallpox might have been largely reduced\r\nif parents had had the knowledge and the means to nurse their\r\noffspring through their illness. They died less of smallpox than of\r\nignorant and defective treatment whilst under smallpox.\r\n\r\nI have also to observe that smallpox in Sweden was steadily\r\ndeclining toward the close of the century, and that the decline\r\ncontinued into the present century. Taking the years in decades\r\nfrom 1749 to 1868, and casting the average, we have these results--\r\n\r\n                                        Annual      Annual\r\n                            Deaths    Death-rate  Deaths from\r\n     Decade.

It\r\nwas at first viewed with distrust by some of the leading medical\r\nauthorities, but grew so rapidly in favour, that the medical board\r\nin 1803 ventured to make proposals for its general introduction.\r\nBy Royal Letters in 1804 and 1805 measures were decreed for the\r\nencouragement of Vaccination; and in the almanacs for 1806,\r\ninformation and advice were inserted concerning “the new and\r\ncertain means for the prevention and extirpation of Smallpox.”\r\nNevertheless, the practice made way but slowly into the confidence\r\nof the common people, and not until 1812 did a committee of the\r\nDiet go so far as to recommend its compulsory adoption. The\r\nprinciple of compulsion was affirmed by the Diet in 1815, leading\r\nto a Royal Decree of 6th March, 1816, whereby Vaccination was made\r\nobligatory under penalty of fine and imprisonment.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, the law was modified, but never relaxed. Whilst\r\nthe rite was obligatory, it was offered gratuitously, and public\r\nvaccinators, usually parish clerks and midwives, were appointed\r\nthroughout the land, and stimulated to exertion by special rewards.\r\nVaccination was made a condition of admission to school, and was\r\nplaced by the clergy on a level with baptism and confirmation.\r\nWherefore, in course of time, it has come to pass that Sweden is\r\ndescribed as “the best vaccinated country in the world.”\r\n\r\nTo this result the recognised interest of the Swedish clergy\r\nin medical practice largely contributed. They were not slow to\r\nperceive a fresh line of business in vaccination. Archbishop\r\nLindblom, among others, was extremely zealous in promoting the\r\npractice in his diocese, and from a correspondence between the\r\nConsistory of Upsala and the Medical Board, it appears that the\r\ncompetition between the physicians and the parsons was severe.\r\nThe Consistory complained that the rewards for vaccination energy\r\nwere more liberally bestowed on medical men than on the deserving\r\nclergy, and that it was unfair to insist on the clergy taking out\r\na license to vaccinate, ending with the reproach that the mishaps\r\nof some medical men had so alarmed the people in certain districts,\r\nthat very few were willing to avail themselves of the wonderful\r\nprophylactic. The Board replied, that they were aware that mistakes\r\nhad occurred through the use of spurious cowpox, as proved by the\r\noutbreak of smallpox afterwards; but, at the same time, what better\r\ncheck could be devised on incompetent practitioners than a medical\r\nlicense? The right of the clergy to vaccinate was not contested,\r\nbut only that they should possess some recognised qualification.\r\nThe extent of the ecclesiastical operations in cowpox appears from\r\nthe return of the Archbishopric of Upsala, which showed that from\r\n1804 to the end of 1810 there were 33,298 persons vaccinated, of\r\nwhom 7,025 were inoculated by clergy, 20,000 by church officers,\r\nand 6,273 by medical men and others. It was by the clergy and the\r\ndoctors that the project of compulsion was initiated. In a letter\r\nfrom the Medical Board to the King in 1810, complaint was made\r\nthat “the public in Sweden do not in all places manifest the care\r\nand zeal which might be expected from sensible and tender parents\r\nin applying for, or allowing to be applied, the precious means\r\nof salvation provided for their children’s good looks and future\r\nhealth.” In 1814, the same Board wrote that “several of the Bishops\r\nwho take the deepest interest in the spread of vaccination, have\r\nexpressed their conviction that certain well-devised penalties\r\nhave become as necessary as regards the ignorant masses as\r\nencouragements are useful”; and as late as 1815, the Board had to\r\ntestify against the “sluggishness and indifference prevalent among\r\nthe less enlightened classes.”\r\n\r\nCompulsion was, therefore, enacted in 1816 to overcome the inertia\r\nof the lower orders, the mass of the people who at all times yield\r\nthe largest crop of smallpox.\r\n\r\n“Smallpox was exterminated in Sweden by vaccination,” is a common\r\nsaying. Moore, in his _History of Vaccination_, published in 1817,\r\nafter describing the various measures taken, observed--\r\n\r\n  It is superfluous to add, that by such a concurrence of virtuous\r\n  exertions, Smallpox was quickly suppressed in Sweden.\r\n\r\nEre proceeding to inquire whether smallpox was thus suppressed,\r\nI would call attention to the hands by which vaccination was\r\nadministered in Sweden. It is the custom at this day to describe\r\nvaccination as a delicate operation, and to attribute subsequent\r\nsmallpox to some irregularity or defect in its performance; and\r\nyet here we are asked to contemplate a whole nation delivered\r\nfrom smallpox, the vaccinators being chiefly priests, clerks, and\r\nmidwives. What does it mean? Is it that any sort of vaccination\r\nis good when smallpox does not follow, and that any sort is bad\r\nwhen smallpox does follow? If smallpox had not ceased out of the\r\nland, would it then have been said, “What wonder, considering the\r\ncharacter of the vaccinators”?\r\n\r\nTo the assertion that smallpox in Sweden was exterminated by\r\nvaccination, the answer is an unqualified contradiction. It is\r\nnot true; it is demonstrably untrue. Smallpox was declining in\r\nSweden before vaccination was heard of, and the fall continued\r\nirrespective of its influence. Look at the figures. Here we have\r\nthe returns of smallpox mortality in Sweden during the last sixteen\r\nyears of the past, and the first sixteen years of the current\r\ncentury, up to the time when vaccination was made compulsory--\r\n\r\n             Deaths                     Deaths\r\n    Year.     from             Year.     from\r\n            Smallpox.

True, but the introduction of vaccination was\r\none thing, and its diffusion over the nation another. It was a\r\nsection of the people least likely to be affected with smallpox\r\nwho welcomed and practised vaccination; and however energetic\r\nand successful they might be in their promotion of the new rite,\r\ntheir efforts were limited to thousands among millions. All the\r\nwhile smallpox was declining, and they took the decline for\r\nencouragement, and began to cry out, “See! see what we are doing!”\r\nThe enactment of compulsory and gratuitous vaccination in 1816 was\r\nan open confession that the lower classes remained to be dealt\r\nwith, that is to say, the very people among whom smallpox had its\r\nstronghold. There are tribes whose priests profess to bring rain,\r\nand drive away sickness with their enchantments; but if showers had\r\nbegun to descend, and the sick to recover, ere their assistance\r\nwas invoked, it would be hard to convince even the credulous\r\nthat the desired relief was due to their subsequent magic. But it\r\nis precisely in the subsequent magic of the vaccinators that we\r\nare asked to believe when told that vaccination drove smallpox\r\nout of Sweden. It was going out before vaccination was called in,\r\nand kept going out all the same when the vaccinators plied their\r\nenchantments. Happily, patient Nature holds her way unprovoked by\r\nhuman quackeries. Not even to confute impostors does she reverse\r\nfor an instant her impartial operations.\r\n\r\nBut, although deaths from smallpox fell off so rapidly, there was\r\nno correspondent improvement in the public health. Smallpox was\r\nmerely replaced by other forms of disease. Thus, the death-rate of\r\nSweden per 1,000 for seventy years, stands as follows--\r\n\r\n    Decade.        Deaths.  |  Decade.        Deaths.\r\n                            |\r\n    1749-1758       27·76   |  1789-1798       25·56\r\n    1759-1768       27·38   |  1799-1808       26·46\r\n    1769-1778       29·22   |  1809-1818       27·63\r\n    1779-1788       26·52   |\r\n\r\nMoreover, smallpox mortality, whilst rapidly decreasing before\r\nthe enactment of compulsory vaccination, has since been slowly\r\nincreasing. Thus--\r\n\r\n    Years before   Average annual  |  Years after  Average annual\r\n    Compulsion.       smallpox     |  Compulsion.     smallpox\r\n                     mortality.    |                 mortality.\r\n    1756-1775           5,480      |  1816-1835           450\r\n    1776-1795           4,617      |  1836-1855           577\r\n    1796-1815           2,303      |  1856-1875         1,031\r\n\r\nWe therefore see that while Jenner and his friends were boasting\r\nof their achievements in Sweden, they had to account for the fall\r\nin smallpox before their intervention, and for its continued\r\ndecline ere their intervention was operative; and, moreover, to\r\nanswer the question, What is the profit of salvation from smallpox\r\nif death ensue from other causes? It is, however, to be observed\r\nthat such large considerations were outside the scope of Jenner’s\r\nintelligence. _There was_ smallpox, and _there was_ vaccination,\r\n_his_ invention, the infallible preventive of smallpox, and he saw\r\nnothing beyond. His self-love was implicated in the defence of\r\nvaccination, and any story in its favour was accepted as true, and\r\nproclaimed abroad, whilst anything to its discredit was resented as\r\na personal affront, or denounced as wilful and diabolic falsehood.\r\nAs for statistics, he had no capacity. Baron says, “Neither Dr.\r\nJenner’s previous education nor his habits gave him a relish for\r\nany of the branches of pure science; and he seemed to have a\r\npeculiar horror of arithmetical questions, and was often jocular\r\non this defect in his nature.”[263] This inability to calculate\r\ngoes far to account for the absurdity of many of his statements\r\nconcerning the miraculous effects of vaccination among populations\r\nwhere only two or three per cent. had been operated upon; and\r\nwho, therefore, must have vicariously delivered the remainder\r\nfrom smallpox. To an intellect thus defective, the introduction\r\nof vaccination to Sweden was the vaccination of the Swedes; the\r\ndecline of smallpox was its suppression; and its suppression was\r\nthe consequence of vaccination. But the excuse that is available\r\nfor Jenner does not serve those who cannot plead his congenital\r\ndefect, and are satisfied to repeat his preposterous assertions.\r\n\r\nSmallpox kept declining in Sweden until the decade (1841-50)\r\nwhen the annual average of deaths per million fell to 212. The\r\nvariations in the mortality in single years are remarkable. Here\r\nare thirteen years when the deaths were under a hundred--\r\n\r\n    1821   37\r\n    1822   11\r\n    1823   39\r\n    1829   53\r\n    1842   58\r\n    1843    9\r\n    1844    6\r\n    1845    6\r\n    1846    2\r\n    1847   13\r\n    1848   71\r\n    1855   41\r\n    1856   52\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, here are eighteen years when the deaths were\r\nover a thousand--\r\n\r\n    1825   1,243\r\n    1833   1,145\r\n    1834   1,049\r\n    1838   1,805\r\n    1839   1,934\r\n    1850   1,376\r\n    1851   2,488\r\n    1852   1,534\r\n    1858   1,289\r\n    1859   1,470\r\n    1865   1,336\r\n    1866   1,217\r\n    1867   1,061\r\n    1868   1,429\r\n    1869   1,474\r\n    1873   1,122\r\n    1874   4,063\r\n    1875   2,019\r\n\r\nThe death-rate from smallpox, which fell to 212 per million in\r\n1841-50, rose to 862 per million in 1851-60, to 867 per million in\r\n1861-70, and, owing to the epidemic of 1873-74, the worst in Sweden\r\nsince 1801, the last decade, 1871-80, will exhibit a higher average.\r\n\r\nIn presence of these statistics, it is fair to repeat the inquiry,\r\n“Why was smallpox declining before vaccination was introduced; and\r\nwhy has smallpox revived and increased in ‘the best vaccinated\r\ncountry in Europe’?”\r\n\r\nAgain, too, I must call attention afresh to the fact of the\r\nirrelevant influence of smallpox upon the national mortality. Mr.\r\nP. A. Siljeström has published a diagram of the course of mortality\r\nin Sweden from 1774 to 1878, with the part smallpox has played in\r\nthat mortality, from which it is manifest (to all who choose to\r\nuse their own eyes) that the action of smallpox as a destroyer of\r\nlife has been wildly exaggerated.[264] Bad years of smallpox are\r\nnot years of a high death-rate, nor are years with little smallpox\r\nyears of a low death-rate. When smallpox is prevalent it appears\r\nto replace other forms of disease, and when not prevalent, to be\r\nreplaced by diseases of greater fatality. Wherefore, argues Mr.\r\nSiljeström--\r\n\r\n  Of what use is it to the public that a smaller number of citizens\r\n  die annually from Smallpox (supposing that this result is brought\r\n  about by Vaccination), if an equally large number, nevertheless,\r\n  die from other diseases? We can see no farther advantage in it\r\n  than there would be in a battle, if none of the men fell before\r\n  the fire of the artillery, but all the more died from the fire of\r\n  the line. To the individual it may possibly be more agreeable to\r\n  die of any other disease than Smallpox, and it ought, therefore,\r\n  to be allowed to everyone to save himself, through Vaccination,\r\n  or any other lawful means, from an eventuality which he fears;\r\n  but this cannot possibly, in itself, be regarded as the business\r\n  of the State.\r\n\r\nSweden is a large country, and its diseases must be subject to many\r\nlocal variations; but Stockholm, representing a compact population,\r\nexhibits much the same phenomena. In some years of last century the\r\ncity was severely afflicted with smallpox, as the deaths in these\r\nyears show--\r\n\r\n    1778    639\r\n    1783    714\r\n    1784    411\r\n    1787    414\r\n    1795    447\r\n    1800    703\r\n\r\nThese years were the worst; there were variations such as these--\r\n\r\n    1780    14\r\n    1782    12\r\n    1785    20\r\n    1793    22\r\n    1797    13\r\n    1798    12\r\n\r\nAs in Sweden at large, so in Stockholm, a fall in smallpox had set\r\nin, and was continued into the new century, until years appeared\r\nwithout a single death; for which vaccination had the credit,\r\nand the disease was proclaimed “stamped out,” none dreaming of\r\nreverse ahead. By and by it began to revive, and deaths were thus\r\nregistered--\r\n\r\n    1857    319\r\n    1865    273\r\n    1866    157\r\n    1870     96\r\n    1871    113\r\n    1873    191\r\n\r\nAnd then came the dreadful epidemic of 1874, when 1,191 perished,\r\nand 317 in 1875.\r\n\r\nThus, in two years, 1,382 perished in a population of 150,000--a\r\ndeath-rate of 7,916 per million--against 2,430 per million in\r\nLondon during the memorable epidemic of 1871; the severest outbreak\r\nof smallpox in the century in “the best and most vaccinated\r\npopulation in Europe!”\r\n\r\nUnder examination, the case for vaccination in Sweden altogether\r\ndisappears. By Mr. P. A. Siljeström the examination has been\r\nconducted with a precision, a thoroughness, and a judicial\r\ntemper that leave nothing to desire. His treatise was translated\r\ninto English by Miss Frederica Rowan, and published in 1875,\r\nunder the title of “The Vaccination Question: an Essay towards\r\ndetermining the Boundaries within which a Scientific Theory may\r\nrightfully claim to have effect given it by Legislation;” and a\r\nskilful abridgment was produced by Prof. F. W. Newman; but the\r\noriginal, which extends to no more than 104 pages, should be\r\nstudied by whoever is seriously interested in the vaccination\r\nquestion. Sweden, through the possession of a long series of vital\r\nstatistics, offers special facilities for a comprehensive study of\r\nthe phenomena of smallpox; and in Mr. Siljeström’s treatise, we\r\nhave veracity with good sense, and science with philosophy, instead\r\nof the inadequate and catchpenny stuff current in this country as\r\n“truth about vaccination.”\r\n\r\nIn Finland, the story of vaccination is much the same as in\r\nSweden, with the difference that there was no natural subsidence\r\nof smallpox to be placed to its credit. Wherefore, as concerns\r\nFinland, it is the habit of vaccinators to preserve a discreet\r\nsilence, the facts not tending to edification in the Jennerian\r\nfaith.\r\n\r\nA curious evidence of the simple trust with which the cowpox\r\nrevelation was received in certain countries, is found in an\r\nordinance issued in Finland constituting smallpox after vaccination\r\na proof of imposture on the part of the vaccinator. The ordinance\r\nran thus--\r\n\r\n  That the Inoculator or Vaccinator whose patients, within a\r\n  shorter or longer time after having by him been inoculated\r\n  or vaccinated, shall prove to have been attacked by natural\r\n  Smallpox, with deadly result or other serious consequence,\r\n  shall without pardon be declared unworthy of all further right\r\n  to reward or confidence, and moreover, be impeached for due\r\n  punishment on account of dishonest and unprofessional behaviour.\r\n\r\nUnder such a law (no severer than many which enact punishment\r\nwhere the buyer does not obtain from the seller what he gives his\r\nmoney for) how would it fare with the legion who now practise\r\nvaccination? But I am reminded that vaccinators no longer undertake\r\nto preserve their patients from smallpox, but only to keep it off\r\nuntil it comes, and then to make it milder.\r\n\r\nVaccination was introduced to Denmark at the same time as Sweden,\r\nand was made compulsory in 1810. As in Sweden, smallpox was\r\nfalling off, and, as in Sweden, the vaccinators were loud in\r\ntheir outcry over their success; but their claim was absurd. The\r\npopulation of Denmark in 1801 was 925,680, and up to 1810 no more\r\nthan 118,782 persons had been vaccinated, whilst the births during\r\nthe same period were 283,905. It was, therefore, assumed that the\r\nvaccination of less than a tenth of the population in eight years\r\nhad reduced and extinguished smallpox among the unvaccinated\r\nnine-tenths! Where there is a disposition to believe, anything may\r\npass for credible.\r\n\r\nSubsequently to 1801 there was little smallpox in Copenhagen, and\r\nfrom 1811 to 1823 not a death from the disease was recorded; but\r\nin 1824 smallpox reappeared; and in 1835 there were 434 deaths in\r\nthe city; when it began to be admitted that vaccination did not\r\nprevent smallpox, and that revaccination was necessary for complete\r\nprotection; but, if requisite, how was the miraculous extinction of\r\nthe disease by the primary vaccination of less than a tenth of the\r\npopulation in the early years of the century to be accounted for?\r\n\r\nHere we have the record of Copenhagen smallpox for seventy-five\r\nyears, 1801-75--\r\n\r\n     Years.   Deaths.   Annual\r\n                       Average.\r\n    1801-10     639       64\r\n    1811-20      --       --\r\n    1821-30     119       12\r\n    1831-40     568       56\r\n    1841-50     245       24\r\n    1851-60     160       16\r\n    1861-70     168       16\r\n    1871-75     518      103\r\n\r\nThus the number of deaths in the five years, 1871-75, was nearly\r\nequal to the deaths in the preceding thirty years, 1841-70;\r\nwhilst at the same time the more or less smallpox had no apparent\r\ninfluence in raising or lowering the general mortality.\r\n\r\nIceland, as a dependency of Denmark, is often cited as evidence\r\nfor the virtue of vaccination. Speaking in the House of Commons\r\nrecently, Mr. T. W. Evans proclaimed, “Vaccination has extinguished\r\nsmallpox in Iceland! There has not been a case in the island for\r\nthirty years.” Could aught be more conclusive? and the assertion is\r\nre-asserted with triumph: yet, under examination, we shall see the\r\nstatement and the inference vanish like smoke.\r\n\r\nFirst, the absence of smallpox from Iceland for series of years\r\nwas nothing uncommon. Iceland’s history is singularly copious and\r\naccurate; and from Schleisner’s _Iceland from the point of view of\r\nMedical Science_, Copenhagen, 1849, we have the following list of\r\nsmallpox epidemics during five hundred years--\r\n\r\n    1347--A great epidemic.\r\n    1380--Ditto.\r\n    1430--Terrible epidemic--8000 deaths.\r\n    1511--A great epidemic.\r\n    1555--Ditto.\r\n    1574--Ditto.\r\n    1580--A kind of variolous disease.\r\n    1590--Smallpox epidemic.\r\n    1616-17--Ditto by importation.\r\n    1632--Smallpox epidemic.\r\n    1636--Ditto.\r\n    1655--Ditto.\r\n    1658--Ditto.\r\n    1670-1--Varioloid and Smallpox.\r\n    1707-9--A dreadful epidemic by importation--18,000 died.\r\n    1742--A small epidemic from case brought in Dutch vessel.\r\n    1762-3--A mild epidemic.\r\n    1785--A small epidemic--73 deaths.\r\n    1786--Epidemic--1237 deaths.\r\n    1787--Epidemic--113 deaths.\r\n    1839-40--Smallpox again brought to Iceland, but prevented from\r\n             spreading by strict quarantine.\r\n\r\nFrom this list it will be seen that for centuries Iceland has had\r\nlong terms of immunity from smallpox. Thus--\r\n\r\n      Dates.        Immunity.\r\n    1347 to 1380    33 years.\r\n    1380 ”  1430    50  ”\r\n    1430 ”  1511    81  ”\r\n    1511 ”  1555    44  ”\r\n    1671 to 1707    36 years.\r\n    1709 ”  1742    33  ”\r\n    1787 ”  1839    52  ”\r\n\r\nInasmuch then as vaccination could have nothing to do with the\r\nyears of immunity in former times, on what ground of reason can\r\nvaccination be set forth as the cause of immunity at this day?\r\nSchleisner observes--\r\n\r\n  Since 1306 Smallpox has been epidemic in Iceland nineteen times,\r\n  and has always been brought in either by French, English, Dutch,\r\n  or Danish ships. In early times it frequently caused a terrible\r\n  mortality, as in 1707, when 18,000 out of a population of 50,000\r\n  perished; and in 1430, when 8000 are said to have died. In\r\n  later years its violence has diminished _in consequence of the\r\n  introduction of Vaccination_. In 1785-6-7, its last attack in the\r\n  eighteenth century, only 1425 persons died.\r\n\r\nVery good; but in 1785-87, vaccination was unknown; and as the\r\nepidemics of 1742 and 1762 are recorded by Schleisner as “small”\r\nand “mild” respectively, while so early as 1580 one is described\r\nas “a kind of variolous disease,” it is evident that vaccination\r\ncould have as little to do with making “smallpox milder” as with\r\nthe long terms of immunity which Iceland has enjoyed.\r\n\r\nIn an appeal by Mr. William Morris on behalf of the Icelanders,\r\nthreatened with famine in 1882 he observed--\r\n\r\n  Lastly, the Measles, which has not been in Iceland for thirty-six\r\n  years, and which falling on a people not used to it, is a deadly\r\n  and not a trivial disease, has attacked Reykjavik, where half\r\n  the people are down with it, and many have died, and it is now\r\n  spreading over the island.\r\n\r\nMeasles absent from Iceland for thirty-six years! Supposing there\r\nwere some dodge against measles corresponding to vaccination\r\nagainst smallpox, would not the exemption in every year up to the\r\nthirty-sixth have been ascribed to its efficacy?\r\n\r\nDr. Garth Wilkinson relates that in 1866 when standing on the\r\nLawrock, where the Althing was held, Dr. Hjaltalin, Medical\r\nInspector of Iceland, told him--\r\n\r\n  When, in 1000 A.D., Christianity was first introduced into\r\n  Iceland, the heathen party in the Althing credited the wrath\r\n  of their gods with a volcanic eruption which broke out on a\r\n  neighbouring farm. Snorri, the great Icelandic historian, being\r\n  present, asked, “What then was it that made the gods angry when\r\n  the older lava was on fire?” It clearly was not Christianity\r\n  then. He carried the day against the gods by this common-sense\r\n  question, and Christianity became the law of the land.\r\n\r\n  Somewhat parallel with this history is the claim made for the\r\n  extirpation of Smallpox by Vaccination in Iceland. It is a\r\n  case of _ante hoc_ pricking the windbag of _post hoc_, and, _a\r\n  fortiori_, of _propter hoc_.[265]\r\n\r\nWhilst thus the Icelandic Vaccination Bubble is burst, it remains\r\nto be observed that if vaccination had saved the Icelanders from\r\nsmallpox it could only have been vicariously--as in so many\r\ninstances of similar salvation; for during the first half of the\r\npresent century no more than 17,072 vaccinations were effected in a\r\npopulation of between fifty and sixty thousand in the flux of birth\r\nand death. The vaccinations are thus recorded--\r\n\r\n    YEARS--1804-15   VACCINATIONS--  1345\r\n      ”    1816-30        ”        10,386\r\n      ”    1831-37        ”         None.\r\n      ”    1838-50        ”          5341\r\n                                   ------\r\n                          Total,   17,072[266]\r\n\r\nThere is much of the like order of “facts in favour of vaccination”\r\ncurrent concerning other European populations, which only pass\r\nmuster because they are rarely subjected to criticism; because\r\nvaccination is considered such a benign invention that to question\r\nits credentials is wicked; and because it is held that if even some\r\nof the claims made for it are touched with fable, yet their effect\r\non the popular mind is so clearly for good in inspiring confidence\r\nand overwhelming occasional mishaps, that it is inexpedient to be\r\nover-scrupulous. But, however instructive and wholesome may be\r\nthe exposure of such sophistications, it is necessary to restrain\r\nourselves, and for the remainder of my Story we shall keep to\r\nEnglish ground.\r\n\r\nFrom the preceding details we see how far vaccination in Sweden,\r\nDenmark and Iceland fell short of the claims made for it by Jenner\r\nand his successors. Jenner, it is true, died in 1823, before the\r\nmore pronounced refutations of his assertions had been evolved,\r\nbut, as said, it is questionable whether he ever realised that the\r\nnames of countries stood for millions of men, women and children\r\nwhose vaccination could only be overtaken by organised exertion in\r\nthe process of years. His various boasts, therefore, of vaccinated\r\nnations and exterminated smallpox are to be taken as proofs of\r\ndefective arithmetical capacity and of that scientific imagination\r\nwhich runs with possibility and matter-of-fact.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[263] Baron’s _Life of Jenner_, vol. ii. p. 293.\r\n\r\n[264] _Tables relative to Vaccination in Sweden, 1774-1778._ London\r\nSociety for the Abolition of Compulsory Vaccination.\r\n\r\n[265] _Vaccination Tracts_, Part III.

Their statistics are the statistics of the Vaccinators,\r\nin which they provide the material for their own condemnation;\r\nwhich is probably the reason why the so-called statistics of the\r\nAnti-Vaccinators are so intensely disliked, avoided, and unanswered.\r\n\r\nThe Newcastle Dispensary in 1877 completed its hundredth year,\r\nhaving been founded in 1777, and Dr. Monteith prepared a concise\r\nhistory of the institution, which was published in 1878 by order of\r\nthe Committee.[267] The report is especially valuable as a record\r\nof the comparative incidence of disease in a large industrial\r\npopulation, where, if anywhere, smallpox might be expected to\r\nshow itself in severe form. In 1781 the population of Newcastle\r\nwas estimated at 23,000; in 1821 it had risen to 41,794; in 1851\r\nto 87,784; and in 1871 to 128,443; and through all these years\r\nand changes, the Dispensary continued in active operation, the\r\npercentage of the patients to the population being maintained with\r\nremarkable uniformity. It is needless to add that the majority\r\nof the patients have been from the ranks of the poor, among whom\r\nsmallpox has always its chief seat. As Dr. Monteith observes--\r\n\r\n  They are the class intermediate between the well-to-do\r\n  working-man and the pauper. The state of distress in which\r\n  these people continually live is known to few. The patient,\r\n  when visited by the doctor, is usually found lying in “poverty,\r\n  hunger, and dirt,” and the treatment of the cases is undertaken\r\n  in circumstances very unpropitious to success. Medical advice and\r\n  medicine are not the only things needed. Good food, warmth, and\r\n  judicious nursing are imperatively required, and are seldom if\r\n  ever attainable.\r\n\r\nBefore turning to the Dispensary’s record of a century of smallpox,\r\nit may be well to observe that Variolation was practised in\r\nNewcastle with great assiduity, and that the Dispensary took a lead\r\nin the business, the surgeons inoculating any one who applied. Dr.\r\nMonteith relates--\r\n\r\n  By the year 1777 the arguments in favour of Variolation had so\r\n  far triumphed over the habits and prejudices of the profession\r\n  that there is no instance mentioned in our reports of any\r\n  medical man in Newcastle opposing it. It is always spoken of as\r\n  one of the best established facts of medical science. With the\r\n  general public the case was different. Their prejudices were as\r\n  strong as ever, and they exhibited a horror of Variolation which\r\n  would satisfy the most ardent Anti-Vaccinator. To combat these\r\n  prejudices various means were tried--sermons from the pulpit,\r\n  pathetic exhortations in the newspapers, etc. The last and most\r\n  convincing argument consisted of a pecuniary reward to parents\r\n  who should allow their children to undergo the operation. The\r\n  sum offered was 5s. for one child, 7s. for two, 9s. for three,\r\n  and 10s. for four, and upwards. The success of this expedient\r\n  was remarkable. Parents came flocking in with their children\r\n  in great numbers. Tempted by the rewards, they subjected their\r\n  little ones to an operation which, unless their sentiments had\r\n  greatly altered, they believed to be barbarous and hurtful in\r\n  the extreme, and a clear temptation of Providence. Variolation\r\n  on these terms commenced in the spring of 1786; and every\r\n  year thereafter, until 1801, children were operated on at the\r\n  Dispensary at the rate of over 200 per annum. In 1801 there had\r\n  been in all 3,268 operated upon.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Vaccination came into vogue, Variolation was denounced\r\nas the chief cause of the existence of smallpox. It was said that\r\nwhat was done to avert the disease from the individual diffused it\r\namong the multitude. Vaccinators long maintained that they could\r\neasily exterminate smallpox, if only Variolators would refrain from\r\nkeeping it alive. Variolation gradually ceased, and was formally\r\nprohibited in 1840, and by and by Vaccination was made compulsory.\r\nNevertheless, the confident prophecy of the Vaccinators remains\r\nunfulfilled, for smallpox is not exterminated.\r\n\r\nThe change from Variolation to Vaccination at the Newcastle\r\nDispensary was immediate. Dr. Monteith says--\r\n\r\n  It is creditable to the good sense and enlightenment of the\r\n  Dispensary authorities that they _at once_ abolished Inoculation\r\n  of Smallpox, and substituted Vaccination in its stead. In 1801,\r\n  the first year, 215 children were vaccinated. The annual number\r\n  rapidly rose until it reached its maximum in 1813, when 1,874\r\n  were vaccinated, after which the numbers as rapidly declined.\r\n\r\nFor this decline various reasons were assigned, such as the\r\nincrease of the private practice of vaccination, and the\r\ndisposition to undervalue every benefit, however great, that is\r\npurely eleemosynary. It is forgotten that Vaccination fell off\r\nas its illusory character became more and more manifest, and as\r\nthe promises made on its behalf were, one and all, indisputably\r\nbelied. When Jenner died in 1823, he passed away amid indifference,\r\nif not contempt. His bubble had burst. The furore for vaccination\r\nwitnessed in the present generation is by no means a continuation\r\nof the original furore. That passed away. Our furore is a revival,\r\ndating from the popularity of sanitary reform, to the back of which\r\na new generation of medical men contrived to attach vaccination!\r\n\r\nIn the hundred years, 1777 to 1877, the Dispensary had to deal with\r\n2,616 cases of smallpox, of which 428 terminated fatally, which as\r\nto years and mortality may be thus classified--\r\n\r\n    Years.           Cases.   Deaths.   Mortality\r\n                                         per 100.\r\n    1777 to 1802       365      90        24·6\r\n    1808 ”  1827       273      57        20·8\r\n    1828 ”  1852       925     152        16·4\r\n    1853 ”  1877     1,053     129        12·25\r\n                     -----     ---        ----\r\n                     2,616     428        16·3\r\n\r\nThe progressive reduction in mortality is, of course, ascribed\r\nto vaccination having made the disease milder; though the report\r\ninforms us that “the mortality from smallpox reached its highest\r\npoint--33·3 per cent. in the five years from 1802 to 1807,” the\r\nvery time when enthusiasm in favour of the Jennerian rite was\r\nat its acme. We, on the other hand, would attribute the lower\r\nmortality, as did Dr. Andrew Combe, to better modes of treatment,\r\neven neglect being preferable to much of the old-fashioned regimen\r\nfor smallpox. Considering the figures, Dr. Monteith observes--\r\n\r\n  Of Smallpox I desire to speak with circumspection, for in\r\n  Newcastle Anti-Vaccinators are somewhat rampant. Figures,\r\n  however, are stubborn things, and their import is not easily\r\n  explained away. Like the vast majority of medical men, I have\r\n  always firmly believed in the good results of Vaccination.\r\n  Without admitting that my faith has been shaken by considering\r\n  these statistics, I must confess that I have been a good deal\r\n  disappointed with them. I had expected to find this terrible\r\n  disease regularly decimating the population every year until the\r\n  epoch of Jenner’s discovery, and afterwards diminishing, rapidly\r\n  and steadily, almost to nothing. These figures do not warrant us\r\n  in taking so sanguine a view of the matter.\r\n\r\n  Whilst, therefore, we observe considerable improvement in\r\n  the figures, I am of opinion that they leave us in this\r\n  dilemma--either that there now exists a grossly exaggerated\r\n  impression of the prevalence and fatality of Smallpox in former\r\n  times, or else that they had begun to decrease long before the\r\n  discovery of Vaccination, the beneficial effects of which must,\r\n  therefore, have been at least assisted by other causes.\r\n\r\nHere we have an honourable confession from out the bonds of\r\nprofessional prejudice, and a reluctant exposure of the legend of\r\na world decimated by smallpox, and ceasing to be decimated after\r\nthe advent of Jenner. There is nothing singular in the Newcastle\r\nevidence that has awakened distrust in the mind of Dr. Monteith.\r\nSimilar evidence is found wherever facts are available. The legend\r\nto the contrary has become established, like many other legends,\r\nby dint of repetition, until those who venture to question it are\r\nregarded with suspicion and dislike.\r\n\r\nThe Report of the Newcastle Dispensary illustrates another truth,\r\nnamely, that the abatement or cessation of smallpox is by no means\r\nequivalent to a reduction of death; that evil conditions of life\r\nremaining unchanged, a fall in smallpox is compensated for by a\r\nrise in some cognate form of zymotic disease. Thus Dr. Monteith\r\nremarks:\r\n\r\n  It is generally said by the opponents of Vaccination that the\r\n  other exanthemata have increased since its introduction. It must\r\n  be allowed that our figures (probably unreliable as general\r\n  data), give some support to this supposition. The proportion of\r\n  cases of Scarlatina in the five years, 1827-32 was 4·3 per cent.\r\n  It has never reached that high limit since; but the percentage\r\n  has never fallen below 2 in the last thirty-five years. Mortality\r\n  has also increased to an alarming extent. At one time so low as\r\n  2·5 per cent., it has amounted to 17 per cent. in the last five\r\n  years. Scarlatina is now by far the most fatal disease on the\r\n  list, with the exception of Consumption.\r\n\r\nOf Scarlatina, the Dispensary record stands thus--\r\n\r\n      Years.       Cases.  Deaths.  Mortality\r\n                                     per 100.\r\n    1777 to 1802     355     33       9·3\r\n    1803 ”  1827     795     30       3·7\r\n    1828 ”  1852   1,856    155       8·3\r\n    1853 ”  1877   3,659    567      15·5\r\n                   -----    ---      ----\r\n                   6,665    785      11·7\r\n\r\nOf Measles it is said, “the disease has somewhat increased in\r\nnumbers, whilst the proportion of deaths to cases has not varied\r\nmuch.” Thus the record stands--\r\n\r\n      Years.

At present\r\n  it appears to remain stationary at a figure somewhat above\r\n  the average of the century. There is a common impression that\r\n  Whooping Cough is a disease of little danger and no importance,\r\n  but the following table shows that of late years it has been more\r\n  fatal than Smallpox or Measles.\r\n\r\n      Years.

Conditions of\r\nexistence remaining equal, one may be the substitute of the other,\r\nmaintaining thereby a common death-rate. Diarrhœa is sometimes\r\nplaced in the same category; and, like erysipelas, it is to a\r\nlarge extent a consequence of vaccination. It should never be\r\nforgotten that vaccination induces a constitutional disturbance or\r\nfever, which illness is offered to Nature as a propitiation for\r\nsmallpox; with which propitiation, say the vaccinators, Nature is\r\nsatisfied, and withholds the infliction of smallpox. Vaccination,\r\nas an illness, however, is frequently attended with diarrhœa, and\r\nthe increase of that affection, _pari passu_, with the increase of\r\ninfant vaccination, is marked. Thus stands the record of Diarrhœa--\r\n\r\n      Years.        Cases.  Deaths.

The majority of the deaths takes\r\n  place among infants; and the disease is produced in most cases\r\n  by the ignorance or carelessness of mothers in giving them\r\n  food which is not fit for them. But why this should be the case\r\n  now any more than it was twenty or fifty years ago, I cannot\r\n  understand. An increased consumption of alcoholic stimulants in\r\n  later times has been suggested to me as an explanation.\r\n\r\nAny explanation is welcome that will preserve vaccination from\r\nreproach, yet what medical man is ignorant of the fact that\r\ndiarrhœa is one of the commonest sequences of vaccination? Nature\r\nthus endeavouring to throw off the effects of the virus infused\r\ninto the blood.\r\n\r\nTaking, then, these five diseases in the order of their mortality,\r\nthey range thus--\r\n\r\n                           1777-   1803-   1828-   1853-\r\n                             1802    1827    1852    1877   Total.\r\n\r\n    Scarlatina,  { Cases,    355     795   1,856   3,659    6,665\r\n                 { Deaths,    33      30     155     567      785\r\n    Diarrhœa,    { Cases,  1,390   1,529   3,995   6,117   13,031\r\n                 { Deaths,    67       7      43     362      497\r\n    Smallpox,    { Cases,    365     273     925   1,053    2,616\r\n                 { Deaths,    90      57     152     129      428\r\n    Whooping-    { Cases,    245     220     743   1,716    2,924\r\n      Cough,     { Deaths,    22      23     112     241      398\r\n    Measles,     { Cases,    186     435   1,572   2,537    4,730\r\n                 { Deaths,    16      22      83     123      244\r\n\r\nIn the course of a century the Newcastle Dispensary had dealt with\r\na total of 250,637 cases, of which no more than 2,616 were of\r\nsmallpox, or about 1 in 96. The total deaths during the century\r\nwere 14,088, of which no more than 428 were due to smallpox,\r\nor about 1 in 33; whilst from scarlatina they were 1 in 18,\r\nfrom diarrhœa 1 in 30, and from whooping-cough 1 in 35. It may\r\nbe said, the record of the Dispensary does not account for the\r\npopulation of Newcastle. True; but it accounts for the lower strata\r\nof the population, and, therefore, for an excessive proportion\r\nof smallpox. The complete statistics of the city would exhibit\r\nsmallpox as a still lighter affliction. And, we repeat, there is\r\nnothing singular about the record of the Newcastle Dispensary. It\r\nis a common story. Whenever we get out of the region of romance,\r\nand tread the ground of matter-of-fact, it is to discover that the\r\nwilder horrors and ravages of smallpox have been originally evolved\r\nfrom imagination, and are perpetuated in ignorance from hearsay.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[267] _Report of the Newcastle Dispensary, from its Foundation\r\nin 1777._ Printed by order of the Committee. Newcastle-upon-Tyne,\r\n1878.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\nTHE NORWICH EPIDEMIC--1819.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have repeatedly cautioned my readers against the common\r\nassumption that the London smallpox of last century was the\r\nmeasure of English smallpox. It was not so. Smallpox was endemic\r\nin London, whereas it occurred as an occasional epidemic in other\r\nEnglish towns, and was almost unknown in many rural districts.\r\nMoreover, the disease was not allowed to die out, but was\r\ndiligently cultivated and diffused by variolation. As vaccination\r\nwas introduced, the practice of variolation correspondently\r\nceased, and with its cessation there was an abatement of smallpox,\r\nwhich abatement was unwarrantably ascribed to vaccination. How\r\nmuch of the smallpox of last century was due to variolation it\r\nis impossible to determine; nor would it be safe to accept the\r\nassertions of the early advocates of vaccination on the point. I\r\napprehend that if smallpox were something desirable which everyone\r\nwas intent on catching, it would be discovered that it could not\r\nbe universally caught, and that its propagation had definite\r\nlimits; and it is not improbable that among Londoners the limit\r\nof propagation was closely approached, so that nearly all who\r\nwere susceptible contracted the disease. What, however, I wish\r\nto enforce is, that the decline in the prevalence of smallpox in\r\nsome places coincidently with the introduction of vaccination was\r\nlargely due to the discontinuance of smallpox culture, and that\r\nthe suppression of that culture would have given the same result.\r\nNor let it be forgotten that an almost world-wide fall in smallpox\r\nhad set in toward the close of last century, which the vaccinators\r\nattributed to their prophylaxy in the nineteenth. Miraculous\r\neffects are frequently asserted where miraculous causes would be\r\ndisowned.\r\n\r\nThe vital statistics of last century are, to a great extent, the\r\nproducts of inference and conjecture, and more or less affected\r\nby the purpose and bias of their collectors; but if even we had\r\nthe correct mortalities of smallpox in the chief centres of\r\npopulation,--such as York, Hull, Norwich, Chester, Coventry, Bath,\r\nBristol, Exeter, and Plymouth--we should still be puzzled to\r\nseparate what was due to insanitary conditions of life from what\r\nwas due to the artificial induction of the disease by variolation.\r\nIt has been said that the 18th Century did not terminate in England\r\nuntil 1830; and accepting that liberal allowance, we may resort to\r\nan interesting record of a virulent epidemic in Norwich in 1819 for\r\nsome light on the character and incidence of urban smallpox prior\r\nto the rise of such great communities as Liverpool, Manchester,\r\nLeeds, Sheffield, and Birmingham. The account of the epidemic was\r\nwritten by John Cross, a surgeon practising in Norwich.[268]\r\n\r\nIn those days Norwich contained a population of about 40,000. The\r\ncity was accounted salubrious, and smallpox was little known. Cross\r\nwrites that “in 1805, _after being for a time almost extinct_,\r\nsmallpox prevailed so much in Norwich as to excite some attention.”\r\nThe attention excited led to an attempt to introduce vaccination.\r\nA meeting was held in the Guildhall, 16th July, 1805, “to concert\r\nmeasures for the extermination of the disease,” and resolutions\r\nwere passed to discourage inoculation with smallpox, and “to\r\nsubstitute immediate and universal vaccination of the inhabitants\r\nof the city and its hamlets.” This outbreak of smallpox and\r\nvaccination appears to have subsided together, for Cross continues--\r\n\r\n  After being absent for a year or two, Smallpox was again\r\n  introduced to Norwich by an individual from London, and spread\r\n  so extensively among those whose obstinacy or whose prejudices\r\n  made them resist Vaccination, that 203 deaths from Smallpox were\r\n  recorded in the Bills of Mortality between 1807 and the end of\r\n  1809. Smallpox again appeared in 1813, in which year 65 deaths\r\n  took place; the mortality being confined to so small a number by\r\n  the early and extensive adoption of Vaccination before the danger\r\n  was actually at hand. From the year of 1813, it may be said,\r\n  there was no Smallpox in Norwich until the rise of the epidemic\r\n  which I propose to describe. Not a death from the disease was\r\n  noticed for four years. Indeed, the only case that came to my\r\n  knowledge, during the time specified, was the servant of a\r\n  celebrated public character, who, being seized with Smallpox, was\r\n  detained in Norwich, but from whom, so far as I could learn, the\r\n  contagion did not extend.\r\n\r\nI shall presently refer to the number of vaccinations effected in\r\nNorwich, and to their influence in arresting smallpox. What I would\r\nnow draw attention to is, the comparative rarity of smallpox in\r\nNorwich in those times. Years two, three, and four elapsed without\r\na single death from the disease! How does such a fact accord with\r\nthe common-place of vaccinators, that before the advent of Jenner\r\nthe people of England were decimated with smallpox, and that\r\n40,000 perished annually? When we press for evidence for these\r\nextraordinary statements, we either get no answer, or we discover\r\nthat the mortality of a bad year of London smallpox has been\r\nmultiplied by the population of the United Kingdom, thus yielding\r\nthe astounding total of 40,000 victims. Our reply is, that there is\r\nno warrant whatever for this conversion of London mortality into\r\nnational mortality; that London was unique in its circumstances;\r\nand that, setting the immense rural majority aside, even in the\r\nlargest cities, such as Norwich, years passed without any deaths\r\nfrom smallpox.\r\n\r\nVaccination had the prestige of fashion, and the leading citizens\r\nof Norwich were philanthropic and scientific after the newest\r\nlights, and whatever was accounted “proper,” they were intent to\r\neffect. To have the vulgar vaccinated was, however, no easy matter.\r\nMany declined because they had no fear of smallpox. What, indeed,\r\nhad they to be alarmed about? Moreover, as experience advanced,\r\nthe futility and danger of the new inoculation became more and more\r\napparent. It began to be known that it not only failed to avert\r\nsmallpox, but it frequently induced serious illness, permanent\r\ninjury, and sometimes death. It is to be remembered that the\r\nsymptoms of vaccination were watched at the outset of the practice\r\nwith keen attention, and that the general verdict, especially of\r\nmothers, was distinctly adverse to its harmlessness. That such was\r\nthe common judgment was manifest from the rapid decline of the\r\nearly furore in its favour, and its contemptuous neglect by the\r\nmass of the people until revived and enforced by legislation. As\r\nthe citizens of Norwich would not be vaccinated, it was determined\r\nto try the effect of bribery, and surgeon Rigby in 1812 induced the\r\ncourt of guardians to offer a reward of 2s. 6d. to every person\r\n“who should bring a certificate from a surgeon of having gone\r\nsatisfactorily through the cowpox.” The results of this bribery are\r\nset forth as follows by Cross--\r\n\r\n     511 received the award in 1813\r\n      47    ”          ”       1814\r\n      11    ”          ”       1815\r\n     348    ”          ”       1816\r\n      49    ”          ”       1817\r\n      64    ”          ”       1818\r\n    1402    ”          ”       1819\r\n\r\nThe larger numbers in 1813, ’16, and ’19 were due to panic and\r\npressure; but the figures maybe taken for a graphic representation\r\nof the distrust with which vaccination was regarded after ample\r\nexperience. Of course many were vaccinated who did not claim the\r\nparish half-crown; and at the end of 1819 it was calculated that\r\n10,000 in Norwich had submitted to the Jennerian rite from the\r\ndate of its introduction at the beginning of the century. Thus\r\nconsiderably less than a fourth of the inhabitants were what is\r\ncalled “protected.”\r\n\r\nWe now come to the narrative of that great outbreak of smallpox,\r\nwhich, says Cross, destroyed more lives in less time in Norwich\r\nthan any epidemic since the Plague. It is almost superfluous to\r\nstate that the disease did not originate in Norwich: it never\r\nappears to originate anywhere: it was imported. A girl travelling\r\nwith her parents from York caught the infection in transit at a\r\nmarket-town, and as soon as she arrived in Norwich was laid up with\r\nthe disease.\r\n\r\n  This happened [says Cross] in the latter end of June, 1818; and\r\n  the earliest cases of Smallpox that were seen by any medical\r\n  man were traced to this origin. I have been able to ascertain\r\n  the different families by which the disease was kept up during\r\n  the remainder of that year, but it extended to very few, and\r\n  proved fatal in only two instances. A druggist inoculated three\r\n  children in January, 1819, thus helping in a small degree to\r\n  spread the contagion, which the season of the year was calculated\r\n  to keep within narrow bounds. Still no alarm was excited; a\r\n  single medical man only was acquainted with the disease; and the\r\n  cases of Smallpox were so few until the latter end of February\r\n  as to be scarcely noticed. At this time, however, the disease\r\n  extended from one of our greatest charity schools to all quarters\r\n  of the city.... Comparatively dormant during the winter, as the\r\n  season became milder it burst upon us suddenly and unexpectedly,\r\n  continuing its work of devastation for three or four months with\r\n  undiminishing fury.

The rapid declension of the disease from\r\n  that period is obvious from the above table; and it was so nearly\r\n  extinct at the end of the year, that I could not find a variolous\r\n  patient from whom ichor could be procured for an important\r\n  experiment. As probably one in six of all who were affected by\r\n  the epidemic died of it, I am convinced it is not far from the\r\n  truth to assert that considerably over 3000 individuals, or a\r\n  thirteenth part of the whole population of Norwich, had Smallpox\r\n  in the year 1819.\r\n\r\nIt is always sound policy to take what is considered the case\r\nagainst us at its worst; and as this dreadful Norwich epidemic\r\nis cited as evidence of what is possible in the absence of\r\nvaccination, and as something that opponents of vaccination\r\nshould regard as conclusive against them, there is cause to give\r\nit special attention; and the more so as the leading facts are\r\nwell ascertained. First, however, I would remark that I have no\r\ndesire to minimise the horrors of smallpox: it is a loathsome,\r\nand, because preventible, a discreditable disease: but neither let\r\nus maximise its horrors, but try, at least, to recognise facts in\r\ntheir true dimensions.\r\n\r\nFive hundred and thirty died in Norwich of smallpox in 1819 of 3000\r\nsupposed to have had the disease, the deaths being, as commonly\r\nestimated, one in five or one in six of those affected. The deaths\r\nfrom all diseases in Norwich in 1819 were 1352--a mortality of\r\n30 per 1000; a high rate, but by no means uncommon in urban\r\npopulations free from smallpox. I have next to observe that if 3000\r\nhad smallpox, there were 37,000 who escaped, and to ask, How did\r\nthey escape? By what means were they protected? It may be replied\r\nthat a fourth of them were vaccinated; but how does that account\r\nfor the immunity of 30,000 unvaccinated? The 10,000 vaccinations\r\nreputed to have been effected in Norwich from the beginning of the\r\ncentury were the work of nearly twenty years, and the major part\r\nof them in 1819 must have been represented by adults practically\r\nout of the range of infection, protected not by vaccination, but by\r\ntheir years.\r\n\r\n“Protected by their years! What do you mean?” exclaims a reader.\r\n\r\nPrecisely what I say--that in the Norwich epidemic, as in variolous\r\nepidemics generally, adults are comparatively secure, and the\r\nyoung, and especially infants, are the victims. In Norwich, in\r\n1819, scarcely a bread-winner, or a father or mother was laid in\r\nthe grave slain by smallpox.\r\n\r\n“It is incredible!”\r\n\r\nIt is incredible simply because the facts of smallpox are\r\npersistently overlooked. Here is proof of the incredible in a\r\nstatement carefully prepared by Cross of the ages of the 530 who\r\ndied in the Norwich epidemic--\r\n\r\n    Under two years of age,           260\r\n    Aged from two to four years,      132\r\n       ”      four to six years,       85\r\n       ”      six to eight years,      26\r\n       ”      eight to ten years,      17\r\n       ”      ten to fifteen years,     5\r\n       ”      fifteen to twenty years,  2\r\n       ”      twenty to thirty years,   2\r\n       ”      thirty to forty years,    1\r\n                                      ---\r\n                                      530\r\n\r\nIt will be said, as a matter of course, that if these children\r\nhad been vaccinated they would not have perished; but the answer\r\nis that at this day the chief mortality of smallpox is among the\r\nvaccinated young, in whom the whole virtue of the rite may be\r\nsupposed to abide fresh and efficient. Cross was an enthusiastic\r\nvaccinator, but he allows, with due excuses, that the vaccinated\r\nminority contributed a certain quota to the sick and the dead, and\r\nthat the ill repute of vaccination caused many in their terror to\r\nresort to variolation, and thus to incur and diffuse the mischief\r\nof which they stood in dread. Some old women and a druggist were,\r\nhe says, responsible for four or five hundred of these creations\r\nof smallpox during the epidemic, “each of which became a centre of\r\ncontagion.”\r\n\r\nAge, I said, constituted the chief protection from smallpox,\r\nbut good houses and good fare formed another line of defence.\r\n“The effects of the Norwich epidemic were confined _almost\r\nexclusively_,” says Cross, “_to the very lowest orders of the\r\npeople_.” Moreover, he observes--\r\n\r\n  The disease was often aggravated, and made to assume its worst\r\n  characters, by the most injudicious treatment. The prejudiced and\r\n  most ignorant being the principal sufferers, the prescriptions of\r\n  old women were more listened to than the advice of medical men.\r\n  A practice kept up by tradition among the poor of the city for\r\n  above a century was revived, in spite of all remonstrance, as\r\n  follows--\r\n\r\n  “At the commencement, to set the object before a large fire and\r\n  supply it plentifully with saffron and brandy to bring out the\r\n  eruption; during the whole of the next stage to keep it in bed\r\n  covered with flannel, and even the bed-curtains pinned together\r\n  to prevent a breath of air. To allow no change of linen for ten\r\n  or more days, until the eruption had turned; and to regard the\r\n  best symptom to be a costive state of the bowels during the whole\r\n  course of the disease.”\r\n\r\n  Such were the means by which the horrors of the epidemic were\r\n  aggravated. The old nurses triumphed not a little in having an\r\n  opportunity of showing their skill after it had been so long\r\n  unexercised; nor was it often easy, among the deluded persons in\r\n  whose families this affliction occurred, to persuade or compel\r\n  them to adopt a different plan of treatment.\r\n\r\nCross described several cases in which unquestionable vaccination\r\nhad been followed by unquestionable smallpox. In one instance, a\r\ngirl of eleven years of age, correctly vaccinated in both arms,\r\nperished of malignant smallpox, whilst her unvaccinated brother,\r\nsix years of age, recovered from a severe attack. Such cases in\r\n1819 were treated as exceptional, but they have long passed into\r\nthe category of matter-of-course, and ceased to excite observation\r\nor surprise.\r\n\r\nSuch was the memorable Norwich epidemic. However dreadful, it was\r\nin no wise extraordinarily dreadful. If the death-rate was raised\r\nfor a single year, it would be reduced in subsequent years, and\r\nthe average rate recovered that accorded with the common obedience\r\nof the community to the laws of health. In Nature consequences are\r\nequal, and any temporary aberration is in the long run compensated\r\nfor. If vaccination could have kept smallpox from Norwich, the\r\ncitizens would have had in some other form the measure of disease\r\nthat pertained to their way of life.\r\n\r\nWe might, moreover, inquire, whether to escape an epidemic, severe\r\nas that of 1819, it would have been economical to put 40,000\r\npeople through the pains and perils of vaccine fever. Why should\r\na universal affliction be incurred to avert a partial one?--an\r\naffliction confined to the young of the lower orders. The\r\nvaccination of Norwich from 1801 to 1819 would have cost far more\r\nsickness and death than did the smallpox of the same years. In\r\nshort, if vaccination had conferred the immunity claimed for it,\r\nthe price of the salvation would have been in prodigious excess of\r\nits value.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[268] _A History of the Variolous Epidemic which occurred in\r\nNorwich in the year 1819, and destroyed 530 Individuals; and an\r\nEstimate of the Protection afforded by Vaccination, and a Review of\r\nPast and Present Opinions upon Chickenpox and Modified Smallpox._\r\nBy John Cross, Member of the Royal College of Surgeons in London.\r\nLondon, 1820.

WATT’S DISCOVERY--GLASGOW, 1813.\r\n\r\n\r\nAddressing the House of Commons in 1878, Sir Thomas Chambers said,\r\n“You cannot show that Vaccination has reduced deaths, or saved a\r\nsingle life. There may be no Smallpox, but the disappearance of\r\nSmallpox is by no means equivalent to a reduction of mortality.”\r\nM.P.’s were astonished and incredulous; but ignorantly. The fact\r\nis incontestable; and Dr. Robert Watt of Glasgow had the signal\r\ndistinction of detecting and setting it forth in the year 1813.[269]\r\n\r\nWatt was writing a treatise on Chincough, otherwise Whooping Cough,\r\nand in the course of his work made a careful examination of the\r\nregisters of death in Glasgow to ascertain how far it was true\r\n“that the disease was more fatal some years than others; that it\r\nwas more dangerous at a particular age; and that the female sex\r\nsuffered more from it than the male;” and, from the outset of his\r\ninvestigation, “was struck with the immense numbers carried off\r\nyearly by the Smallpox.” He might well be struck; for Glasgow was a\r\nrare place for Smallpox, as appears from the following statement\r\ncompiled from Watt’s Tables--\r\n\r\n    DEATHS IN GLASGOW FOR TEN YEARS, 1783-1792.\r\n\r\n    Year.

Taking an\r\n  average of several years, I found that more than half the human\r\n  species died before they were ten years of age, and that of this\r\n  half more than a third died of the Smallpox; so that nearly a\r\n  fifth part of all that were born alive perished by this dreadful\r\n  malady.\r\n\r\nWatt meant of course the human species as exhibited in Glasgow,\r\nof whom more than half died before the age of ten, and a fifth of\r\nsmallpox. What was true for a time of Glasgow smallpox was not even\r\ntrue of Edinburgh, much less of the whole earth.\r\n\r\nVariolation was practised in Glasgow, but to what extent appears\r\nto be unknown. Certain, however, it is that smallpox was as little\r\ndreaded as are other calamities accounted common and unavoidable.\r\nIndeed many were not unwilling to subject their offspring to the\r\ndisease at seasons supposed to be favourable on the principle of\r\n“getting a bad job over.” Then, too, the mass of the population was\r\ndisposed as if by design for the generation of febrile ailments.\r\nTall buildings forming narrow lanes, wynds, or closes issued\r\nlike so many rents or fissures from the leading thoroughfares.\r\nThese buildings were divided into flats packed with humanity from\r\nbasement to attic. Air and light were treated as superfluities.\r\nWater there was none, save what was brought from wells; and middens\r\nreceived the slops and refuse often shot from the windows. Life\r\nin a Glasgow wynd in former days is indescribable, yea almost\r\ninconceivable; yet in such wynds multitudes passed their existence,\r\nconscious of no hardship, recognising nothing better, and withal\r\ncharacterised by many virtues. Bearing such conditions in mind,\r\nthe vital statistics of Glasgow excite no surprise: the wonder\r\nis that the death-rate did not draw nearer to extermination. As\r\nfor smallpox, how could a family resident in a flat in a noisome\r\nGlasgow close at the end of last century escape smallpox, if\r\nsmallpox were prevalent? To them smallpox lay in fate, and was\r\naccepted on the same terms as wind and weather, summer and winter.\r\n\r\nNovelties have always had a ready welcome in Glasgow, and when\r\ncheap and easy salvation from smallpox was proclaimed, there was a\r\nrush for it. Smallpox abated: vaccination had the credit: and faith\r\nwas justified. Considering the devastation smallpox had wrought\r\namong the young, Watt says--\r\n\r\n  I began to reflect how different the case must be now; and to\r\n  calculate the great saving of human life that must have arisen\r\n  from the Vaccine Inoculation. At this time [1813] above 15,000\r\n  had been inoculated publicly at the Faculty Hall, and perhaps\r\n  twice or thrice that number in private practice. In eight years\r\n  [1805-12] little more than 600 had died in Glasgow of Smallpox;\r\n  whereas in 1784 the deaths by that disease alone amounted to 425,\r\n  and in 1791 to 607; which, on both occasions, exceeded the fourth\r\n  of the whole deaths in the city for the year.\r\n\r\nIt seemed reasonable to infer that since the mortality from\r\nsmallpox had so largely declined, fewer children must have died;\r\nbut to Watt’s astonishment the facts did not answer to the logic.\r\nHe writes--\r\n\r\n  To ascertain the real amount of this saving of infantile life, I\r\n  turned up one of the later years, and by accident that of 1808,\r\n  when to my utter astonishment, I found that still a half, or\r\n  more than a half, perished before the tenth year of their age! I\r\n  could hardly believe the testimony of my senses, and therefore\r\n  began to turn up other years, when I found that in all of them\r\n  the proportion was less than in 1808; but still on taking an\r\n  average of several years, it amounted to nearly the same thing\r\n  as at any former period during the last thirty years. This was a\r\n  discovery I by no means expected, and how it could have come to\r\n  pass appeared to me inexplicable.\r\n\r\nWe shall better understand Watt’s perplexity over smallpox reduced\r\nand death unaffected, if we set before us the table of mortality\r\nfor the decade during which vaccination was brought into practice\r\nin Glasgow.\r\n\r\n    DEATHS IN GLASGOW FOR TEN YEARS, 1803-1812.\r\n\r\n    Year.

He was\r\nsatisfied that vaccination arrested smallpox, but it was plain\r\nthat it did not arrest death, and he felt bound to find some\r\nexplanation--\r\n\r\n  From every circumstance that has come under my observation, the\r\n  efficacy of Vaccine Inoculation appeared certain. The experience\r\n  of pretty extensive practice had confirmed me fully in this\r\n  opinion. But still the question recurred, how are we to account\r\n  for the same, or nearly the same, number of deaths under ten\r\n  years of age? As no new disease has appeared, the deficiency\r\n  occasioned by the want of Smallpox must have been made up by a\r\n  greater mortality among the other diseases of children. Has it\r\n  been equally divided among them, or has a greater share fallen to\r\n  some than to others? To solve this question is the chief object\r\n  of my inquiry.\r\n\r\nTo ascertain the fact, he divided the thirty years, 1783-1812, into\r\nfive periods of six years each, and thus set forth the average\r\nproportionate mortalities--\r\n\r\n   Years.

Smallpox had fallen off, but if its victims\r\nwere merely assigned to other modes of death, where was the\r\nadvantage? Watt continues--\r\n\r\n  The first thing which strikes the mind on surveying the preceding\r\n  Table, is the vast diminution in the proportion of deaths by\r\n  the Smallpox--a reduction from 19·55 to 3·90 per cent.; but the\r\n  increase in the Measles column is still more remarkable--an\r\n  increase from ·93 to 10·76 per cent. In Smallpox we have the\r\n  deaths reduced to nearly a fifth of what they were twenty-five\r\n  years ago, whilst in the same period, the deaths by Measles have\r\n  increased more than eleven times. This is a fact so striking,\r\n  that I am astonished it has not attracted the notice of older\r\n  practitioners.\r\n\r\n  The greatest number of deaths from Smallpox in any one month\r\n  during the last thirty years was 114 in October, 1791. In\r\n  the following December they were 113. These are the only two\r\n  instances in thirty years when the deaths by Smallpox amounted to\r\n  100 in a month. But these were slight visitations when compared\r\n  with the ravages which have been committed in an equally short\r\n  time by Measles. In May, 1803, the deaths by Measles alone\r\n  amounted to 259, in June to 260, and in July to 118. In December,\r\n  1811, they amounted to 161, and in the January following to 130.\r\n  What an amazing difference when we compare these numbers with\r\n  433, the sum of all the deaths by Measles in eighteen years\r\n  preceding 1801! In the last five years 1430 have died of Measles\r\n  in Glasgow.\r\n\r\nThis prodigious increase in the mortality from Measles was\r\nnaturally referred by some observers to the practice of\r\nVaccination, and Watt held there was ground for the assumption\r\ninasmuch as when Smallpox preceded Measles it made Measles milder--\r\n\r\n  When Measles was so prevalent and fatal in 1808, I was often\r\n  told that it was owing to the Vaccine Inoculation; but this I\r\n  considered an idle tale, the invention of those who were hostile\r\n  to Cowpox. I could readily admit that more must die of Measles\r\n  than formerly; for some of the weak and unhealthy, who would have\r\n  died of Smallpox (saved from Smallpox) would fall a sacrifice to\r\n  Measles; but I could not then go farther.\r\n\r\n  But however novel and strange the opinion may appear, it must be\r\n  admitted that while Smallpox was in full force, it had the power\r\n  of modifying and rendering Measles mild; and now that Smallpox is\r\n  in great measure expelled, Measles is gradually coming to occupy\r\n  the same ground. I am sorry to make this statement, but the\r\n  facts, at least with regard to Glasgow, are too strong to admit\r\n  of doubt....\r\n\r\n  That Measles should have been modified by Smallpox is rendered\r\n  highly probable by the manner in which the Vaccine Disease\r\n  prevents Smallpox or renders it so mild as to be without the\r\n  smallest danger. May not Smallpox have a similar effect in\r\n  relation to Measles?\r\n\r\n  When Smallpox was in full force, few children escaped, and most\r\n  of those who had Smallpox and Measles had Smallpox first. This,\r\n  I believe, will have been the case with more than nine-tenths\r\n  of the community. Still, however, as Measles came round, it\r\n  occasionally had precedence of Smallpox, and it was perhaps\r\n  chiefly among such patients that it proved fatal. In looking over\r\n  the registers of former years, I find the deaths by Measles were\r\n  generally among very young children.\r\n\r\nHe was even disposed to believe that Smallpox, on the whole,\r\nexercised a beneficial influence in the eradication of latent\r\ndisease--\r\n\r\n  An opinion has prevailed with some, that Vaccination does\r\n  positive harm by infusing peccant or vicious humour into\r\n  the constitution. I do not see the smallest ground for this\r\n  hypothesis; but that Smallpox does good to those who survive\r\n  the disease by rendering the system insusceptible of other\r\n  infections, or by rendering them milder when incurred, must, I\r\n  think, be admitted.... I do not presume that the constitution\r\n  is improved by Smallpox, but perhaps by eradicating certain\r\n  unobserved deviations from health, which, if not early removed by\r\n  the accession of some acute disease, would have proved the seeds\r\n  of early mortality by gaining a deeper hold of the constitution\r\n  before Measles and other epidemics of later appearance came round.\r\n\r\n  In this point of view, we are not to consider Smallpox as\r\n  peculiarly fatal, but fatal merely as having the start of\r\n  some other diseases. Measles, Chincough, Croup, and Scarlet\r\n  Fever would have proved equally fatal had any of them occurred\r\n  first.... It is only on this principle that we can explain how\r\n  it happened that thirty years ago not one in a hundred died of\r\n  Measles, whereas now one in ten dies. Thirty years ago as few\r\n  escaped Measles as now, but before they were affected they had\r\n  generally passed through Smallpox, by which the secondary disease\r\n  was so modified as to be almost completely divested of danger.\r\n\r\nWatt, it will be observed, treats smallpox throughout as a malady\r\nof childhood; thus confirming Monro’s observation in 1765, that\r\n“the inhabitants of Scotland generally have smallpox in their\r\ninfancy or childhood, very few adults being seen in the disease.”\r\n\r\nFrom the preceding excerpts, it is not difficult to comprehend\r\nWatt’s position. He was persuaded of the prophylaxy of\r\nvaccination; he was satisfied that it had reduced smallpox in\r\nGlasgow; but, to his astonishment, he discovered that it had not\r\nreduced the general death-rate; and that in so far as smallpox\r\nhad been displaced, other ailments, and specially measles, had\r\nmaintained the tale of fatality.\r\n\r\nThe discovery that the fall in smallpox was compensated for by a\r\nrise in deaths from other diseases was a remarkable discovery,\r\nthe importance of which is as yet far from appreciated. Watt was\r\nhowever at fault in attributing the decline of smallpox in Glasgow\r\nto vaccination; and in failing to inquire whether the phenomenon\r\nhad any relation to vaccination whatever. He is the best scientific\r\ndemonstrater who most completely exhausts the possibilities to\r\nthe contrary of what he seeks to establish. Supposing vaccination\r\nto be as powerful against smallpox as its promoters averred, the\r\ncauses in Glasgow was not commensurate with the effect. Nowhere was\r\nvaccination more practised. 15,000 were vaccinated at the Faculty\r\nHall, says Watt, “_and perhaps twice or thrice that number in\r\nprivate practice_”--a loose and questionable statement. The 15,000\r\noperated on at the Faculty Hall in the course of ten years were the\r\npoor, the vast majority in Glasgow and elsewhere, and the chief\r\nsufferers from smallpox. The assumed “twice or thrice that number”\r\nwere those who employed their own medical men--a luxury less common\r\nthen than now. The population of Glasgow approached 100,000, and\r\nit is obvious that the larger part must have lived outside the\r\nfortification of the Jennerian rite.\r\n\r\nBut admitting that all, or nearly all, in Glasgow were vaccinated\r\nwho had not had smallpox, still that would afford no proof for what\r\nwas claimed. Watt was cautious, and held closely by his Glasgow\r\nevidence, content to have it taken for what it was worth; but\r\nhad he ranged wider, he would have discovered that the fall in\r\nsmallpox extended over Europe, and was as well marked in Vienna as\r\nin Glasgow, in Stockholm as in London, in Italy as in Denmark. As\r\nin Glasgow the credit for the fall was claimed for vaccination,\r\nbut the fall had set in before vaccination was heard of, and\r\nextended over populations to which vaccination had no application.\r\nIndeed Watt allows that the fatality of smallpox had begun to\r\ndecline and that of measles to increase prior to the conveyance of\r\nthe Jennerian salvation to Glasgow; but he failed to discern the\r\nsignificance of the fact. So too in other cities where smallpox\r\nfell off: the death-rate did not fall off; but, as in Glasgow, was\r\nkept up by cognate varieties of fever.\r\n\r\nAs concerns Watt, we have the advantage of some notes upon his\r\n“remarkable treatise” by Dr. William Farr in the _Thirtieth Annual\r\nReport of the Registrar-General_, 1869. Having given an abstract of\r\nWatt’s results, Dr. Farr observes of his discovery of displaced and\r\nreplaced mortality--\r\n\r\n  This is an important point in pathology; and it must be admitted\r\n  that although there were defects in his data, Dr. Watt succeeds\r\n  in showing (1) that Smallpox was one of the greatest causes of\r\n  death in Glasgow down to the year 1800, (2) that the deaths by\r\n  Smallpox were reduced to a fifth of their original number by\r\n  Vaccination,[270] and (3) that the children died in nearly the\r\n  same numbers as before, but of other forms of disease.\r\n\r\n  Glasgow has always been famous for statistics, and these\r\n  unfortunately show an increase of the mortality of children. Thus\r\n  in the five years 1821-25 the mortality of boys under five years\r\n  of age was 8·08; in 1831-35 it was 9·78. In the year 1865 the\r\n  mortality of boys in Glasgow was 11·48, of girls, 10·36. These\r\n  recent returns confirm the principle. Smallpox is no longer so\r\n  fatal as it was before Vaccination was introduced; in Glasgow it\r\n  caused in the year 1864 no longer 20 but 2 in 100 deaths--only\r\n  180 in 6054 deaths, that is 3 per cent. of the deaths under five\r\n  years of age; yet the mortality of children is certainly as high,\r\n  probably higher, than it was in the last 10 years of the last\r\n  century.\r\n\r\n  Compulsory Vaccination in England has reduced further the\r\n  fatality of Smallpox, but since 1853 other diseases have so\r\n  prevailed as to counter-balance the gain under this head. The\r\n  mortality of children has not declined in a corresponding degree.\r\n\r\nWith confirmation under such authority, it is needless to enforce\r\nthe validity and importance of Watt’s discovery. Dr. Farr is\r\npleased to ascribe the subsidence of smallpox alike in England and\r\nGlasgow to vaccination, but he makes no effort to prove his case:\r\nindeed the effort might have led him to recognise his mistake.\r\nReferring to scarlet-fever, he shows how from a mild it has become\r\na severe affliction--\r\n\r\n  Sydenham (d. 1689) describes simple Scarlatina distinctly: he\r\n  does not refer to the throat affections, and says the patient\r\n  can only die by the doctor’s default. Joseph Frank describes the\r\n  disease as _now_ the most dreadful scourge in Europe.\r\n\r\nIf then scarlet fever has of itself acquired this terrible\r\nintensity and predominance, why should it be thought incredible\r\nthat smallpox of itself should undergo correspondent mitigation\r\nand diminution? Or, is it to be argued that vaccination has\r\nextinguished smallpox to revive as scarlet fever?\r\n\r\nDr. Farr proceeds to observe--\r\n\r\n  It is singular that Dr. Watt, evidently a practitioner of great\r\n  sagacity, does not at all advert to the wretched sanitary\r\n  condition in which the increasing population of Glasgow lived at\r\n  the time he was writing.\r\n\r\nIt is the observation of Dr. Farr that is singular. At the time\r\nwhen Watt wrote there was no clear conception of the relation of\r\ncondition to disease. Jenner was always writing about smallpox, yet\r\nthere is not a hint in any of his papers as to its development in\r\nfilth and stench. His own residence was a pesthouse, but it never\r\nentered into his head to ask, Why? Let us avoid anachronism. Those\r\nwhose memory or reading extends to the cholera epidemic of 1831-32\r\nwill know, that it was regarded as an inscrutable visitation toward\r\nwhich humble submission was the proper attitude. A letter of\r\nCollins, the artist, to the Rev. R. A. Thorpe, 26th November, 1831,\r\ncorrectly expresses the common feeling. Referring to the Cholera\r\nand the Reform Bill, he says--\r\n\r\n  Of the two scourges now afflicting us, I know not which is the\r\n  worse, but I _do_ know that we have fallen into the hands of God\r\n  in both cases, and not before we deserved it.[271]\r\n\r\nI myself recollect the dismay the Combes excited in Scotland\r\nwhen they began to teach that we were largely responsible for\r\nour ailments, and that sickness and sanctity were an unwholesome\r\nalliance; and how a pious physician remarked, when the prevalence\r\nof typhus in Glasgow had been denounced as disgraceful to the\r\nauthorities, “We have learnt the truth in another school, and would\r\nshudder to impeach the Divine prerogative in life or in death.”\r\nWhat Watt really thought of smallpox is to be found in a passage of\r\nhis treatise which Dr. Farr must have overlooked. He says--\r\n\r\n  We may it seems, by the permission of Divine Providence, deprive\r\n  death of some of its apparently most efficient means, but\r\n  deprived of these, new means are discovered, or the old improved.\r\n\r\n  I cannot help quoting the following passage from Dr. Woolcombe as\r\n  somewhat prophetic of this general result. Says he--\r\n\r\n  “May not the discovery of the Cowpox, if it should ultimately\r\n  effect the extermination of the Smallpox, which it may do when\r\n  the prejudices of mankind shall permit, be welcomed rather on\r\n  account of its influence in diminishing human suffering, than\r\n  on account of its effect in diminishing human mortality? Since\r\n  disease is one of the appointed checks to excessive population,\r\n  and the plan of Providence in the creation of human life requires\r\n  the termination of the existence of one-third of its creatures\r\n  before they have attained the age of two years, it may be doubted\r\n  whether the annihilation of so efficient an instrument as\r\n  Smallpox can be admitted without the substitution of some other\r\n  equally destructive malady. The substituted malady may indeed\r\n  be productive of less collateral affliction than the loathsome\r\n  distemper whose place it supplies. But granting that no direct\r\n  substitute should arise, it will not follow that disease in\r\n  general will be deprived of its accustomed share in checking\r\n  population; and if it be not, the only difference will be in the\r\n  proportion of victims submitted to other disorders. The infant\r\n  rescued from Smallpox, may be rescued only to perish in childhood\r\n  by Measles or Scarlatina, or be preserved to swell the list of\r\n  youthful victims to the insatiate maw of Consumption.”[272]\r\n\r\nSuch was the manner in which Watt dealt with the problem of\r\nmortality. Sanitation had no place in his consideration. It was,\r\nhe thought, the design of Providence to limit population, and if\r\nchildren were saved from smallpox, they would be cut off otherwise;\r\nand the statistics of Glasgow confirmed the opinion. Smallpox had\r\nabated, but funerals were numerous as ever. The uniformity of the\r\nmortality we admit, but no longer ascribe it to Providence intent\r\non the limitation of population. If children die, it is not of\r\nfate, but from the ignorance, or indifference, or wickedness of\r\nthose who are responsible for them.\r\n\r\nStill some may object, “If by vaccination or any other means\r\nsmallpox is got rid of, Should we not to that extent save life?”\r\nThe answer is, No. Life is only extensible in so far as improvement\r\nis effected in the conditions of life. Forms of disease are subject\r\nto modification; they are probably convertible and interchangeable;\r\none form comes as another goes; but conditions remaining the same,\r\nthe crop of death is equal. Hence Mr. Edwin Chadwick’s advice--\r\n\r\n  Keep your eye on the death-rate. Let nothing short of its\r\n  reduction satisfy you. There may be no startling outbreak of this\r\n  fever or of that fever; but if the death-rate is unabated, there\r\n  can be no improvement that ought to satisfy you. The death-rate\r\n  is the test of sanitary progress. Keep therefore your eye on the\r\n  death-rate.\r\n\r\nThus it was that though smallpox subsided in Glasgow no lives\r\nwere saved; for no change for the better having taken place in\r\nthe condition of the inhabitants, the means of death were merely\r\ntransferred to other agencies. As Dr. Farr observes--\r\n\r\n  The Glasgow victims were gathered together from all quarters,\r\n  from the Highlands, from Ireland, and from elsewhere; they were\r\n  lodged in conditions unsuitable to human life.... To render them\r\n  unassailable by the matter of Smallpox was not enough, for it\r\n  left them exposed to the other forms of disease. Thus in a garden\r\n  where the flowers are neglected, to keep off thistle-down merely\r\n  leaves the ground open to the world of surrounding weeds.\r\n\r\n  To operate on mortality, protection against every one of the\r\n  fatal zymotic diseases is required; otherwise the suppression of\r\n  one disease-element opens the way to another.\r\n\r\nDr. Farr thus exactly expresses what I wish to enforce. Whether\r\nsmallpox prevail or disappear is of little importance. What is of\r\nimportance is the prevalence of disease and death, and not the\r\npresence or absence of any of their special factors when the total\r\nresult is constant and the measure of violated physiological laws.\r\nIt is true that Dr. Farr recognises a virtue in vaccination, but\r\non much the same terms that obeisance is rendered to a fetish.\r\nVaccination might be struck out of his arguments without affecting\r\nhis conclusions. How, for example, could the facts with their\r\nrationale be better stated than in these his words?--\r\n\r\n  Out of 1000 born in Liverpool, 518 children were destroyed in the\r\n  first ten years of their life; some by Smallpox, many by Measles,\r\n  Scarlatina, Whooping Cough, many by Typhus and Enteric Fever;\r\n  one disease prevailing in one year, another disease prevailing\r\n  in another; _but still yielding the like fatal results_. This\r\n  represents what Dr. Watt found in Glasgow long ago. Out of 1000\r\n  children born in London, 351 died under ten years of age by\r\n  zymotic diseases and other causes; the deaths are less by 167\r\n  than the deaths in Liverpool. How much less is the loss of life\r\n  by these diseases in the healthy districts of England! There,\r\n  out of 1000, only 205 children die in the first ten years of\r\n  life. The enormous difference cannot be ascribed to Vaccination,\r\n  as common in town as in country; the protection of life against\r\n  Smallpox alone leaves it still at the mercy of the dangerous\r\n  diseases of the insalubrious city.\r\n\r\nDeath from disease in insalubrious circumstances is but part of\r\nthe mischief. Those who survive find their energies enfeebled and\r\ndepressed in the struggle for survival. The time must surely come\r\nwhen smallpox and all allied forms of disease will be accounted\r\ndiscreditable and intolerable, and when their occurrence will be\r\ntaken for notes of warning and command to search for and root out\r\ntheir causes. Then, too, magical preventives and palliatives and\r\nmedical cures will have a very different place in the popular\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJenner read Watt’s pamphlet, and, _more suo_, the wretched creature\r\nfailed to discern its scope and significance, seeing in it a\r\nmalevolent aggression upon his interest in vaccination. He wrote to\r\nMoore from Cheltenham, 6th December, 1813--\r\n\r\n  You probably may not have seen a pamphlet lately published\r\n  by Dr. Watt, as there is nothing in its title that develops\r\n  its purport or _evil tendency_. Measles, it seems, has been\r\n  extremely fatal in Glasgow for the last four or five years among\r\n  children, and during this period Vaccination has been practised\r\n  almost universally. Previously to this, Measles was considered a\r\n  mild disease. Hence Dr. Watt infers that Smallpox is a kind of\r\n  _preparative_ for Measles, rendering the disease more mild. In\r\n  short, he says, or seems to say, that we have gained nothing by\r\n  the introduction of Cowpox; for that Measles and Smallpox have\r\n  now changed places with regard to their fatal tendency. Is not\r\n  this very shocking? Here is a new and unexpected twig shot forth\r\n  for the sinking Anti-Vaccinist to cling to.[273]\r\n\r\nObserve, the truth of Dr. Watt’s evidence was passed over! Inasmuch\r\nas it did not tend to the glory of vaccination, it was “evil,” and\r\nit was “shocking.” At a later date Baron assumed the same line,\r\nsaying--\r\n\r\n  Notwithstanding the proofs of the power of Vaccination in\r\n  diminishing the mortality from Smallpox, it has been a question\r\n  whether _infantile_ mortality has been diminished; it having\r\n  been supposed that the beneficial effects of Vaccination were\r\n  countervailed by a greater mortality in the other diseases of\r\n  children. This very discouraging statement was published by Dr.\r\n  Watt, of Glasgow; and the opinion, which was hastily adopted and\r\n  unwisely promulgated, has unquestionably had a great effect in\r\n  retarding the progress of Vaccination. It, unfortunately, gave\r\n  countenance to some of the worst prejudices of those who were\r\n  opposed to the practice.[274]\r\n\r\nHere again we see no attempt made to disprove Watt’s statement,\r\nwhilst its mischievousness was assumed because it was\r\n“discouraging,” and lent “countenance to some of the worst\r\nprejudices of those who were opposed to vaccination!” Truth is\r\nthe best of all things--except when it spoils business. Then it\r\nbecomes “evil,” and “shocking,” and “gives countenance to the worst\r\nprejudices.”\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[269] _An Inquiry into the Relative Mortality of the Principal\r\nDiseases of Children, and the numbers who have died under Ten Years\r\nof Age in Glasgow during the last Thirty Years._ By Robert Watt,\r\nM.D., Lecturer on the Theory and on the Practice of Medicine in\r\nGlasgow.

The\r\nRoyal Jennerian Society had been wrecked by Jenner’s jealousy and\r\nintrigue. The working and subscribing members seceded with Dr.\r\nWalker, and set up the London Vaccine Institution; and a variety\r\nof ornamental and influential folk, who paid little and did less,\r\nfound themselves with Jenner on their hands, exigent, impecunious,\r\nand helpless, and they publicly committed to the patronage and\r\ndiffusion of vaccination.\r\n\r\nIt was an awkward situation, and two operations for relief became\r\nnecessary: first, to dispose of Jenner; and second, to escape from\r\nthe maintenance of vaccination.\r\n\r\nThe first was effected by inducing the House of Commons to vote\r\nJenner £20,000, and the second by the institution of the National\r\nVaccine Establishment. Thus dexterously, fashionable and medical\r\nLondon contrived to get rid of Jenner and vaccination on terms\r\nsatisfactory to all concerned.\r\n\r\nThe early furore for vaccination had spent itself. Scepticism had\r\nthriven by experience. Many of the vaccinated had taken smallpox,\r\nand explanations and excuses were becoming exhausted. It was easy\r\nto claim the benefit of mistakes when the operators were amateurs;\r\nbut when the failures were the work of Jenner and his certified\r\nassociates, it was hard for faith to hold out. Spurious cowpox\r\nserved to account for many disasters; but when Jenner, pressed to\r\ndefine spurious cowpox, was driven to confess its non-existence,\r\nand that, when he had spoken of it, he had only meant any irregular\r\naction of cowpox on the persons of the vaccinated, it is easy to\r\nimagine how people who had respect for themselves were pleased to\r\ndrop out of the connection. They might not care to express all they\r\nsuspected, nor to proclaim their credulity, but it was a welcome\r\ndeliverance to be no longer responsible for a practice and a\r\ncharacter grown so questionable. On John Bull’s broad back was laid\r\nthe burden.\r\n\r\nIn the project of the National Vaccine Establishment there was\r\nan explicit concession to the scepticism of the time. One of its\r\npurposes was alleged to be _Investigation_. Lord Henry Petty, in\r\nrecommending the measure in the House of Commons, observed--“The\r\nevidence as to the infallible efficacy of vaccination is\r\nconfessedly incomplete; and it is highly desirable that the truth\r\nshould be ascertained by public inquiry, rather than by societies\r\nwhose conductors are liable to the imputation of mercenary\r\nmotives.” Jenner bitterly resented the indignity implied in placing\r\nvaccination under investigation. He held, and in a sense justly,\r\nthat it was too late to speak of investigation when the reality of\r\nhis discovery had been attested in the public honours and rewards\r\nconferred upon him. “Alas!” he exclaimed, “poor Vaccinia, how art\r\nthou degraded!” He was still further outraged by his exclusion\r\nfrom the Board of the Establishment, on the ground that the public\r\nmight have assurance of impartiality. How much sincerity there was\r\nin the profession, I do not pretend to divine; it is sufficient to\r\npoint out that matters had come to such a pass with vaccination\r\nthat it was considered expedient to conciliate the taxpayers with\r\nthe promise of inquiry for their money. Plainly the enthusiastic\r\ncertainty of 1802 had given place to a widely different sentiment\r\nin 1808.\r\n\r\nThere were, however, wheels within wheels. “You may take it for\r\ngranted,” said a Radical of those days, “that every vote of public\r\nmoney has an object in excess of the ostensible one, and covers\r\njobs big or jobs little.” And so it was in the case before us. The\r\ndiscomfited residue of the Royal Jennerian Society had influence\r\nwith the Government to take over their smashed-up enterprise;\r\nbut their solicitation might have been ineffectual, had not the\r\nGovernment seen a way of providing for a certain claimant in the\r\ncourse of the operation. Sir John Moore was serving his country\r\nin the Peninsula; he had friends at the sources of power; and he\r\nhad a brother named James, surgeon to the Life Guards, for whom\r\na comfortable berth was wanted. Let us make Moore, they said,\r\nDirector of this new Establishment, with a salary of £200 a-year;\r\nand the thing was done. Investigation was promised, Cowpox was\r\nendowed, and Moore was provided for.\r\n\r\nJenner had actively promoted the formation of the Establishment,\r\nunder the conviction that he should be its governor; but when\r\nthe organisation was revealed, he was profoundly disgusted. The\r\nmanagement was assigned to a Board of eight members, consisting\r\nof the president and four censors of the College of Physicians,\r\nand the master and two governors of the College of Surgeons,\r\nwith salaries of £100 a-year apiece. From this Board, as stated,\r\nJenner was deliberately excluded, “so as to ensure impartial\r\ninvestigation.” It was at first proposed to hold Jenner subordinate\r\nto the Board, giving him the title of Director, with Moore as his\r\nworking deputy; for it was clearly recognised by those who had\r\nhad experience of him during his London career, that for regular\r\nduty he was good for nothing; and that with his sickly family\r\nresident in Gloucestershire, he was never to be reckoned upon\r\nfor a day. When, however, the Board disregarded his nominations,\r\nespecially that of his bully, John Ring, as “Principal Vaccinator\r\nand Inspector of Stations,” he at once severed his connection with\r\nthe Establishment; “since,” in his own words, “he found that he was\r\nto have nothing to do, and that his office was only a name.” “My\r\nnot being a member of the British Vaccine Establishment will,” he\r\nwrote, “astonish the world; and no one in it can be more astonished\r\nthan myself”; but so far as can be discerned, the astonishment\r\nwas chiefly limited to himself. Evanescent and futile is the\r\nastonishment of the world under most circumstances, and had the\r\npublic opinion of the time been consulted, there is little doubt\r\nthat it would have gone with the Board against Jenner.\r\n\r\nMoore was, therefore, promoted to Jenner’s place as Director of the\r\nNational Vaccine Establishment, in subordination to the Board of\r\nPhysicians and Surgeons. Seven stations, with seven superintendent\r\nsurgeons, were opened in London for vaccinating all who should\r\napply, and for collecting and distributing virus.\r\n\r\n  At first [writes Moore] the applicants for Vaccination at the\r\n  various stations were not numerous, not amounting to 3,000\r\n  a year; but, by continued exertions, and the declension of\r\n  prejudice, the numbers regularly increased, and 7,771 persons\r\n  were vaccinated in London in the year 1816.[275]\r\n\r\nThese numbers are significant, as indicating the extent of the\r\ncollapse of vaccination, and how little the continuous decline of\r\nsmallpox in London was due to its extension.\r\n\r\nMoore was a shrewd tactician. He had the sense to recognise that\r\nif there was anything in vaccination, it was folly to stand at\r\nvariance with Jenner; and by persuading him that he exaggerated\r\nthe offence implied in the policy of the Board, he gradually\r\nsoothed his feelings and led him into a long and confidential\r\ncorrespondence. Jenner, on his side, finding that nothing resulted\r\nfrom his sulks, relaxed, and from time to time favoured the Board\r\nwith the light of his countenance and counsels.\r\n\r\nThe national endowment of vaccination affected prejudicially all\r\nother enterprises in the same line. What remained of the Royal\r\nJennerian Society withered up, and the conductors of the London\r\nVaccine Institution found the collection of subscriptions almost\r\nimpossible. It was naturally objected by those solicited, “Why\r\nshould we be asked to subscribe for what Government has already\r\nprovided?” But with Dr. John Walker, the director of the London\r\nInstitution, vaccination was a fanaticism, and he was ready to\r\nlive on bread and water rather than withdraw from the promotion\r\nof what he was persuaded was a work of salvation. He therefore\r\nstruggled on, in spite of discouragement and petty means, and as\r\nthe inability of the Government Establishment to meet demands\r\nbecame manifest, whether from excess of dignity or apathy, the\r\nQuaker Institution, as it was called, began to thrive, to acquire\r\nthe confidence alike of the medical profession and the public, and\r\nto rival in business the Establishment itself.\r\n\r\nAs for the investigation promised in the House of Commons, it was\r\nnever even attempted. Jenner’s anxiety was superfluous. When a case\r\nof smallpox, or injury, or death after vaccination was reported,\r\nit was the recognised formula to assert either some defect in\r\nthe operation, or the virus, or some cause, or any cause _ab\r\nextra_ rather than allow the Jennerian principle to suffer. As an\r\nillustration of the procedure of the Board in this respect, we have\r\nthe instance of Mr. Thomas Brown, surgeon, Musselburgh, as served\r\nup in Moore’s insolence--\r\n\r\n  The Vaccine was in two years spread over Scotland. After a time,\r\n  however, one croaking voice was raised to disturb the general\r\n  concord. Mr. Brown, who was fretting in obscurity at Musselburgh,\r\n  published a book in 1809 to maintain that the Vaccine only\r\n  possessed the property of preventing Smallpox temporarily; that\r\n  in three years its influence declined; and in five or six, hardly\r\n  any security against Smallpox remained.\r\n\r\nBrown submitted his cases to the Board, but they met with no\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n  In this extremity [continues Moore] he wrote a scurrilous\r\n  accusation of the National Vaccine Establishment to the Secretary\r\n  of State, which was referred to the Board. When they met, the\r\n  Registrar read it, and then tied it up with red tape among that\r\n  mass of papers which are consigned to rest.[276]\r\n\r\nCould more be expressed in less? Thus was Brown, the representative\r\nof true science and enlightened and honest inquiry, set at naught\r\nand traduced by a Board endowed for investigation! Nor, in saying\r\nso, do I speak simply as an antagonist of vaccination. Brown was no\r\nanti-vaccinist. What he contended for is now everywhere admitted by\r\nvaccinists. They allow that the protection afforded by vaccination\r\nis temporary, and that it is necessary to renew its prophylaxy\r\nfrom time to time. The practice of revaccination is based on the\r\nverity of Brown’s contention, and yet, according to Moore, he was a\r\nvain-glorious and scurrilous fellow, and by Jenner was pronounced\r\n“an object of commiseration rather than resentment.”\r\n\r\nAs purveyors of virus, too, the Establishment fell behind Walker’s\r\nInstitution, and the Quakers’ pox had the preference among\r\nconnoisseurs in the article. Jenner wrote to Moore, 5th March,\r\n1816--\r\n\r\n  The Matter sent out by the National Vaccine Establishment is much\r\n  complained of. I was applied to a few weeks since by the surgeons\r\n  of the hospital at Gloucester for some Vaccine Matter, and their\r\n  request was accompanied by the observation, “That after using\r\n  thirty points sent from town, not a single pustule was produced.”\r\n\r\nTo account for such failures, it began to be reported that the\r\nvirus was gradually losing its virtue in transit through many arms;\r\nbut, continued Jenner--\r\n\r\n  Medical men are more expert than others in discovering causes\r\n  without the fatigue of much thinking, and in the present\r\n  instance they have all hit upon the wrong one--no great wonder.\r\n  They attribute the lessened activity of the Matter, and its\r\n  disposition to produce imperfect vesicles, to the great length\r\n  of time which has elapsed since it was taken from the cow, and\r\n  to the immense number of human subjects through whom it has\r\n  passed. This is a conjecture, and I can destroy it by facts. The\r\n  Matter may undergo a change that may render it unfit for further\r\n  use by passing even from one individual to another; and this\r\n  was as likely to happen in the first year of Vaccination as the\r\n  twentieth. There are medical men who will take anything they can\r\n  catch under the mere name of Vaccine Matter, or from pustules\r\n  incorrect in character. It is from the spread of such Matter that\r\n  the dissatisfaction of which I speak has arisen.[277]\r\n\r\nWhen we refer to the record of the National Vaccine Establishment,\r\nthere is little reason for surprise over its inefficiency. The\r\nHouse of Commons, having voted the endowment of £3,000 a-year, the\r\nGovernment committed the organisation of the Establishment and the\r\nadministration of its funds to the heads of the Royal College of\r\nPhysicians. How the £3,000 a-year was disposed of, came to light in\r\n1822, when the accounts were published. The statement stood thus\r\nfor 1821, representing what had gone on during the past twelve\r\nyears--\r\n\r\n                                                 £     £\r\n\r\n    PHYSICIANS.--Sir Henry Halford, Bart.       100\r\n                 Dr. Frampton                   100\r\n                 Dr. Thomas Hume                100\r\n                 Dr. Charles Badham             100\r\n                 Dr. R.

Parliament voted £3,000 a-year to extend\r\nvaccination among the poor, and here were a set of physicians\r\nand surgeons pocketing £800 of it, and muddling away the greater\r\npart of the remainder. They affected to regard vaccination as\r\nthe deliverance of mankind from the scourge of smallpox, and yet\r\nthey had not hesitated to appropriate the means provided for its\r\ndiffusion! There was scarcely the pretence of work for wages.\r\nThe Board met once a week, but the attendance was irregular, and\r\nat each member’s discretion. The eight hundred-a-yearers dropped\r\nin when convenient for gossip, and to ask what was doing. When\r\nset upon their defence, the argument was that the public were\r\ndistrustful of vaccination, and that to inspire confidence it was\r\nnecessary that the Establishment should have the benefit of the\r\nostensible support of the College of Physicians and the College\r\nof Surgeons, for which the honorarium of £100 annually to each of\r\ntheir representatives was by no means excessive. In reply, it was\r\npointed out that Dr. Walker, supported by voluntary contributions,\r\ncollected with difficulty, and with less than the pay of many an\r\nartizan, had done more for vaccination in London and the country,\r\nand was more respected and trusted, than the Establishment with all\r\nthe prestige of corporate authority.\r\n\r\nAs the result of many protests, the waste of public money was\r\nbrought before the House of Commons by Joseph Hume. It was Mr.\r\nHume’s distinction that, with strong good sense and invincible\r\npatience, he upheld the standard of honesty in public finance,\r\nholding that it was as wrong to defraud the nation as to defraud\r\nan individual; and that it was as foolish (not to say more wicked)\r\nto pay away the people’s money for nothing, as to throw away\r\none’s own. The principle, so obviously indisputable, and yet\r\nso shamelessly violated in every department of the State, was\r\nenforced in detail by Mr. Hume with a persistency and success\r\nthat has never been surpassed, and, I fear, never appreciated as\r\ndeserved. He showed that patriotism is a practical virtue, instead\r\nof a sentimental pretext for public plunder, and taught honour to\r\nplacemen to whom honour was unknown. Appropriately, therefore, Mr.\r\nHume led the charge against the National Vaccine Establishment, and\r\nin 1827 the annual vote was reduced from £3,000 to £2,500, £300\r\nof the £500 being saved by knocking off two useless physicians\r\nand one useless surgeon. Even then the extravagance that remained\r\ncontinued to excite indignation, the consequences of which are\r\nrecorded in a “Report from the Select Committee on the Vaccine\r\nBoard, with the Minutes of Evidence, ordered by the House of\r\nCommons to be printed, 28th August, 1833.” If space allowed, it\r\nwould be easy to linger over the disclosures of this Committee.\r\nSuffice it to say, that Dr. George Gregory, of the Smallpox\r\nHospital, held that the whole work of the Board might be done\r\nhandsomely on £1,200 a-year. The Committee, however, shrank from\r\nsuch a severe exercise of economy, and recommended the provision of\r\nthe following staff and expenses--\r\n\r\n    Vaccinators at Stations in London (a sum which will\r\n         probably admit of reduction)                      £900\r\n    Inspector }                                           { 200\r\n    Registrar } Qualified on occasion to exchange duties  { 200\r\n    Messenger                                                55\r\n    Offices, rent of                                        100\r\n    Incidental expenses                                     150\r\n                                                         ------\r\n                          Total                          £1,605\r\n\r\nThe Committee observed that the Board might consist of two\r\nphysicians and one surgeon, whose duties, not being onerous,\r\nmight be discharged gratuitously. As the Committee was more\r\nloose-handed than Dr. Gregory, so the Commons were laxer than the\r\nCommittee. The President and a Censor of the College of Physicians,\r\nand the President of the College of Surgeons, were suffered to\r\ncontinue their £100 a-year each, and the annual subsidy for the\r\nEstablishment stood fixed at £2,200, until vaccination, under the\r\ndisguise of sanitation, developed into the monstrous proportions\r\nwith which we are at this day afflicted.\r\n\r\nThere is much talk prevalent in favour of “the endowment of\r\nresearch;” but what may come of such endowment, when not sharply\r\nlooked after, is manifest in the example of the National Vaccine\r\nEstablishment. The investigation, assumed to start with, was never\r\npursued; and the guardianship of the public interest undertaken\r\nby the Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons was never anything but\r\nmake-believe. Annual Reports were presented to Parliament, signed\r\nby the heads of the Establishment, but of research they bore no\r\ntrace, and many of them might have been dashed off by the Registrar\r\nin the course of an hour. Destitute of any scientific merit, these\r\nreports yet afford some curious glimpses of what was going on from\r\nyear to year, with indications of the chief points of resistance\r\nencountered by the practice of vaccination; and, in turning over\r\nthe series from 1810 to 1840, I have made the following notes,\r\nwhich may be read, perhaps, with interest.\r\n\r\n\r\nVARIOLATION.\r\n\r\nThe chief resistance proceeded from the inoculators with smallpox;\r\nindeed, with the exception of apathy, there might be said to be no\r\nother resistance. Hence we read under the several dates--\r\n\r\n  1810.--During 1809, the surgeons vaccinated 1,493 persons. We\r\n  are sorry to have to relate a decline of Vaccination in the\r\n  Metropolis, and an apparent indisposition to the practice of it;\r\n  and to express regret that there should be evil-disposed persons,\r\n  who are endeavouring to frustrate His Majesty’s intentions by\r\n  alarming the misinformed with stories which they know to be false.\r\n\r\n  1812.--We have reason to ascribe the increase of Smallpox in\r\n  London during last year to the rash and inconsiderate manner\r\n  in which great numbers are still inoculated for the Smallpox,\r\n  and afterwards required to attend two or three times a week at\r\n  the place of inoculation in every stage of their illness. The\r\n  practice of Inoculation is the great means whereby Smallpox is\r\n  kept in existence, and its infection propagated to persons and\r\n  places where it would not otherwise be seen.\r\n\r\n  1814.--The Board has with great regret to observe that, although\r\n  the punishment of three months’ imprisonment was awarded against\r\n  Sophia Vantandillo, for carrying her child, whilst under the\r\n  influence of Smallpox, through the streets, (which infected many\r\n  others, eight of whom died) the unwary are still enticed by the\r\n  hand-bills of shameless empirics to submit their children to\r\n  Variolous Inoculation. It is, however, to be hoped that the above\r\n  sentence passed by the Court of King’s Bench, which the Board\r\n  has taken every method of promulgating, may produce considerable\r\n  benefit. The Board selected Sophia Vantandillo as a proper\r\n  example on account of the extent of the mischief occasioned by\r\n  her misconduct; and that this prosecution, followed by a lenient\r\n  punishment, may prevent any further wilful exposure of inoculated\r\n  persons, is its fervent wish. The Board at the same time\r\n  prosecuted Mr. Burnet, who inoculated the child, and who has long\r\n  circulated most mischievous and offensive hand-bills, offering\r\n  to inoculate persons with Smallpox gratis, and stigmatising\r\n  Vaccination as productive of the most loathsome disease. This\r\n  practitioner having suffered judgment to go by default, has\r\n  been sentenced by the Court of King’s Bench to six months’\r\n  imprisonment.\r\n\r\n  The whole of the expenses incident to this Establishment for\r\n  1814 have been defrayed by the vote of last year, but the Board\r\n  regrets that in consequence of the recent prosecutions and\r\n  convictions, and the measures adopted for the more effectual\r\n  extension of the practice of vaccination throughout the Empire,\r\n  an addition of £500 to the annual grant will be necessary.\r\n\r\n  1815.--In Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Norwich, Inoculation is\r\n  disused, and, in consequence, the Smallpox is scarcely known. In\r\n  the country about Aberystwith in Wales, and Bawtry in Yorkshire,\r\n  it has entirely disappeared. The reverse is, unhappily, the case\r\n  in Portsmouth, Bristol, and London. In the Metropolis alone the\r\n  mortality may be estimated at 1,000 annually; perhaps throughout\r\n  the United Kingdom it is not less than ten times that number. It\r\n  appears to us that this waste of human life can be prevented only\r\n  by such legislative enactments as will entirely put a stop to\r\n  Inoculation with Smallpox.\r\n\r\nThat smallpox was increased by variolation we have no reason to\r\ndoubt, notwithstanding the fact that toward the close of the last\r\ncentury, when variolation was most practised, smallpox was steadily\r\nfalling-off; but to ascribe the existence and persistence of\r\nsmallpox to variolation was absurd. Smallpox was a widely-diffused\r\ndisease before variolation was introduced to anticipate and\r\nminimise it.\r\n\r\n  1817.--The pernicious practice of Smallpox Inoculation, now\r\n  very generally relinquished by the medical profession, is only\r\n  persisted in by a very few of the least creditable class of\r\n  practitioners, and is usually carried on clandestinely; yet the\r\n  Board are concerned to state that this destructive operation\r\n  is now performed for gain by itinerant Empirics, Farriers,\r\n  Publicans, Nurses, low, cunning people of both sexes, and of\r\n  various descriptions. And such is the infatuation of the poor\r\n  and ignorant, that many of them carry their infants to be\r\n  inoculated by those who only know how to inflict, but not how\r\n  to assuage, the violence of Smallpox. The consequence has been\r\n  that many have perished under their management; and the disease\r\n  in particular districts has been widely disseminated. As this\r\n  iniquitous conduct has prevailed much in London, an epidemic of\r\n  Smallpox was last year excited among those who were not secured\r\n  by Vaccination, and 1,051 persons died of the disease.\r\n\r\n  1836.--Only 300 died of Smallpox in London in the course of\r\n  last year; and it is probable that this mortality, however\r\n  comparatively small, is owing to the continued partial practice\r\n  of Inoculation, which is liable to disseminate far and wide its\r\n  contagious influence, to the imminent danger of all who have not\r\n  been protected by previous Vaccination, or by having had Smallpox\r\n  already.\r\n\r\nVariolation was made a penal offence in 1840, and became less\r\navailable as an excuse for the persistence of smallpox in defiance\r\nof vaccination.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAILURE OF VACCINATION.\r\n\r\nAccepting Jenner’s revelation, the heads of the medical profession\r\nin London assured the public, in a manifesto in 1800, that “those\r\npersons who have had Cowpox are perfectly secure from the future\r\ninfection of Smallpox.” It was a rash assertion. Proofs of its\r\nuntruth were not slow to appear. At first they were denied, then\r\nexplained away, and then admitted under qualifications more or\r\nless adroit. When, in 1808, the National Vaccine Establishment was\r\nconstituted, the fact of the failure of Vaccination to answer to\r\nits original promise was generally recognised. Nevertheless, the\r\nreports of the Establishment exhibit much ingenious wriggling and\r\nattempts to out-lie Nature. For example--\r\n\r\n  1811.--That in some instances Smallpox has affected persons who\r\n  have been most carefully vaccinated, is sufficiently established;\r\n  nor ought we to be surprised at this, when we consider that\r\n  Inoculation for Smallpox sometimes fails, and that several\r\n  cases may be produced in which persons have been affected with\r\n  the natural disease more than once in the course of life. The\r\n  Board have infinite satisfaction in stating the two following\r\n  important and decisive facts in proof of the efficacy and safety\r\n  of Vaccination, namely, that in the cases which have come to\r\n  their knowledge, Smallpox after Vaccination, with a very few\r\n  exceptions, has been a mild disease, and that out of the many\r\n  hundred thousand persons Vaccinated, not a single authenticated\r\n  instance has been communicated to them of the occurrence of fatal\r\n  Smallpox after Vaccination.\r\n\r\n  The Board have great pleasure in stating that the money granted\r\n  by Parliament during the last session has been sufficient to\r\n  defray the expenses of the year 1811, and they are of opinion\r\n  that the same sum will be adequate to the expenditure of the\r\n  current year.\r\n\r\nThere were 3,148 vaccinations effected under the Board in 1811,\r\nwhich was at the rate of about £1 a-head.\r\n\r\nMoore, after reporting some cases of smallpox after vaccination, at\r\nSt. Osyth, in Essex, went on to say--\r\n\r\n  1816.--Some very rare instances of failures in Vaccination, as\r\n  exceptions to a general law, may be expected as long as Smallpox\r\n  is prevalent; since it has been fully ascertained that when\r\n  the air is strongly impregnated with the infectious vapour of\r\n  Smallpox, some of those who have had the disease are attacked a\r\n  second time.\r\n\r\n  1818.--From the foundation of this Establishment in 1808 to the\r\n  present year there have been vaccinated 52,253 persons at the\r\n  stations in London. Only four of these are yet known to have had\r\n  Smallpox afterwards, and these were never very seriously ill.\r\n\r\n  1819.--The testimonies of some of our correspondents concur in\r\n  showing that great numbers of persons who had been vaccinated\r\n  have been subsequently seized with a disease presenting all the\r\n  essential characters of Smallpox; but that in the great majority\r\n  of such cases, the disease has been of comparatively short\r\n  duration, unattended by symptoms of danger. In several of these\r\n  cases, however, the malady has been prolonged to its ordinary\r\n  period, and in eight reported cases it has proved fatal. It\r\n  appears to us to be fairly established that the disposition in\r\n  the vaccinated to be thus affected by the contagion of Smallpox\r\n  does not depend upon the time that has elapsed after Vaccination,\r\n  since some persons have been so affected who had recently been\r\n  vaccinated, whilst others who had been vaccinated eighteen and\r\n  twenty years have been variolated, and exposed to contagion with\r\n  impunity.\r\n\r\n  1820.--It is true that we have received accounts from different\r\n  parts of the country of numerous cases of Smallpox having\r\n  occurred after Vaccination, and we cannot doubt that the\r\n  prejudices of the people against this preventive are assignable\r\n  (and not altogether unreasonably, perhaps) to this cause. These\r\n  cases the Board have industriously investigated, and though it\r\n  appears that many of them rest only on hearsay evidence, and that\r\n  others seem to have undergone the Vaccine Process imperfectly,\r\n  yet after every reasonable deduction, we are compelled to allow\r\n  that too many still remain on undeniable proof to leave any doubt\r\n  that the pretensions of Vaccination, to the merit of a perfect\r\n  and exclusive security in all cases against Smallpox, were at\r\n  first admitted too unreservedly.\r\n\r\n  1825.--That a considerable number of persons have had Smallpox\r\n  after having been vaccinated, we are ready to admit; although of\r\n  cases of this kind, a large majority are found on examination\r\n  to be without that test of the operation being performed\r\n  successfully and effectually, which all agree to be necessary to\r\n  perfect security. Vaccination, therefore, it will be said, does\r\n  not afford an absolute and perfect security. We do not present it\r\n  to the world with that pretension, but we declare it to be the\r\n  least imperfect of the resources we possess for encountering the\r\n  disease.\r\n\r\n  1827.--It is true, cases are reported to us very often of the\r\n  occurrence of Smallpox after Vaccination; but we have reason to\r\n  believe that the number of those who fall into this safe, though\r\n  sometimes severe disease, after Vaccination, is not greater than\r\n  that of those who formerly _died_ by Inoculation whilst that\r\n  practice prevailed.\r\n\r\n  1833.--Of an equal number of persons vaccinated and variolated,\r\n  only so many of the former will be capable of taking the Smallpox\r\n  afterwards, and that in a safe degree of the disease, as are\r\n  found to die by the latter.\r\n\r\n  1836.--If 300 children be vaccinated, one will be susceptible of\r\n  Smallpox afterwards, but only in a mild and perfectly safe form,\r\n  whereas if 300 be variolated, one will surely die.\r\n\r\nAs evolutions from inner consciousness, the statistics of\r\nVariolation and Vaccination under 1827, 1833, and 1836 are\r\nnoteworthy. They illustrate the facility of the Board at the\r\ndiscovery of what was thought _ought to be true_.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEVELOPMENT OF A FABULOUS SALVATION.\r\n\r\n  1811.--Previous to the discovery of Vaccination, the average\r\n  number of deaths by Smallpox within the London bills of mortality\r\n  was 2,000 annually; whereas during 1811, only 751 died of the\r\n  disease, notwithstanding the increase of population.\r\n\r\n  1818.--During the year, 6,289 have been vaccinated in London\r\n  and the vicinity; and the Board have much satisfaction in\r\n  adducing unequivocal evidence of the increasing advantages of the\r\n  Jennerian discovery; for it appears from the bills of mortality\r\n  of London that, instead of 2,000 deaths by Smallpox, which was\r\n  the annual average previous to the practice of Vaccination, there\r\n  died in 1818 only 421.\r\n\r\nThat, previous to the introduction of vaccination, 2,000 was the\r\naverage annual death-rate from smallpox in London is a statement\r\nthat requires definition. At an early date the number is under the\r\nmark, and at a later it is over the mark. Dr. Farr delivers the\r\ntruth in these words--\r\n\r\n  Smallpox attained its maximum mortality after Inoculation was\r\n  introduced. The annual deaths from Smallpox in London, from 1760\r\n  to 1779, were on an average 2,323. In the next twenty years, 1780\r\n  to 1799, they declined to 1,740. The disease, therefore, began to\r\n  grow less fatal before Vaccination was discovered, indicating,\r\n  together with the diminution of fevers, the general improvement\r\n  of health then taking place.\r\n\r\nBearing Dr. Farr’s figures in mind (and not forgetting the 2,000\r\nadduced by the Board in the reports for 1811 and 1818), what does\r\nthe reader think of the following audacious attempts on public\r\ncredulity?--\r\n\r\n  1826.--From the quantity of vaccine lymph distributed, we are led\r\n  to presume the practice of Vaccination is becoming daily more\r\n  general; and the inference is still further confirmed by the fact\r\n  that in 1826, only 503 deaths have occurred from Smallpox within\r\n  the bills of mortality; whereas in the preceding year, 1,299\r\n  persons are recorded as having fallen victims to the loathsome\r\n  disease. The whole of this difference ought not, perhaps, in\r\n  candour to be attributed to the influence of Vaccination; for\r\n  Smallpox during 1825 assumed a peculiarly malignant character;\r\n  and there were more instances of the distemper occurring twice\r\n  in the same individual than had ever been reported to us before.\r\n  But when we reflect that before the introduction of Vaccination\r\n  the average number of deaths from Smallpox in London was annually\r\n  about 4,000, no stronger argument can reasonably be demanded in\r\n  favour of the value of this important discovery. Nor can any more\r\n  striking proof be given of the paternal care of the Government\r\n  to protect the people at home and abroad from this destructive\r\n  disease than the establishment and maintenance of this Board.\r\n\r\nThe bouncing falsehood, having passed muster, was repeated with\r\nenlargement at a suitable interval--\r\n\r\n  1834.--Only 334 deaths by Smallpox have been reported, a\r\n  number considerably less than have died in any year since the\r\n  introduction of Vaccination, and falling short by at least 4,000\r\n  of the average of deaths annually by Smallpox in London before\r\n  the protecting influence of Cowpox was discovered and promulgated.\r\n\r\nAnd again it appeared with a fresh touch of exaggeration--\r\n\r\n  1836.--The annual loss of life by Smallpox in the Metropolis\r\n  before Vaccination was established exceeded 5,000, whereas, in\r\n  the course of last year, only 300 died of the distemper.\r\n\r\nImpunity being apparently assured, the fable came to be delivered\r\nas matter-of-course, thus--\r\n\r\n  1839.--Formerly 5,000 died annually of Smallpox within the\r\n  London bills of mortality; but since Vaccination superseded\r\n  Variolation, the number has gradually decreased, until it\r\n  amounted to only 200 in the year 1837. In the course of the\r\n  year that has terminated (during which Smallpox prevailed\r\n  epidemically), there died 800; not one more, after all, than\r\n  one-sixth of the number who died annually [that is to say,\r\n  4,800] during the prevalence of Variolation, notwithstanding the\r\n  increased population of London and its environs. By a careful\r\n  retrospect, we are, therefore, justified in stating that 4,000\r\n  lives are saved every year in London, since Vaccination so\r\n  largely superseded Variolation.\r\n\r\nThe fall in smallpox that set in toward the close of last century\r\nwas not confined to London, but extended to many European\r\npopulations. It began before vaccination was heard of, and\r\ncontinued independently of it, though the vaccinators eagerly\r\nclaimed the phenomenon as the result of their superfluous efforts.\r\nThe claim was absurd as concerned London, for it plainly appears\r\nthat vaccination during the years in question never overtook, or\r\neven approached, the metropolitan birth-rate. Here is the record of\r\nthe vaccinations effected by the Establishment in five years--\r\n\r\n     1818    1819    1820    1821    1822    Total.\r\n    -----   -----   -----   -----   -----   ------\r\n    5,490   7,874   6,054   6,627   8,230 = 34,275\r\n\r\nThe entire vaccinations in five years not equalling the London\r\nbirths in any one year! There were, we dare say, as many more\r\nvaccinated by voluntary effort; but the figures, however extended,\r\ncannot be got to cover the immense mass of lower-class Londoners,\r\nwho then, as now, were the chief factors of smallpox. What I say\r\nemphatically is, the National Vaccine Establishment had as much\r\ninfluence on London smallpox as the Holy Alliance.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOCK-MARKED FACES.\r\n\r\nOne of the arguments for vaccination at this day runs thus--“How do\r\nyou account for the absence of pock-marked faces? When I was young,\r\nforty years ago, nothing was commoner than countenances disfigured\r\nby smallpox.” Occasionally the reminiscence is transferred to a\r\nmother or grandmother, who is reported to have said that she\r\nremembered when every third or fourth person was pitted.\r\n\r\nWe need not take seriously the motherly or grand-motherly\r\nreminiscences, so apt to be touched with the glamour of years.\r\nConfining ourselves to living memories, the owners thereof may,\r\nperhaps, be surprised to learn that the transformation for which\r\nthey personally avouch was effected before they were born, or\r\nwere qualified observers; and before vaccination was sufficiently\r\npractised to have wrought the change; and here is the evidence, as\r\nset forth in the reports of the National Vaccine Establishment, and\r\nprinted by order of the House of Commons. Under the following dates\r\nwe read--\r\n\r\n  1822.--As a proof of the protecting influence of Vaccination,\r\n  we appeal confidently to all who frequent theatres and crowded\r\n  assemblies to admit that they do not discover in the rising\r\n  generation any longer that disfigurement of the human face which\r\n  was obvious everywhere some years since.\r\n\r\n  1825.--The deaths by Smallpox amounted to 1,299 in 1825, a much\r\n  greater number than has been reported for some years past.\r\n  From this melancholy statement it is impossible to avoid the\r\n  conclusion that the lower orders of society continue to be\r\n  prejudiced against Vaccination, and allow Smallpox to take its\r\n  course.\r\n\r\n  And yet what argument more powerful can be urged in favour of\r\n  Vaccination than the daily remark which the least observant must\r\n  make, that in our churches, our theatres, and in every large\r\n  assemblage of the people, to see a young person bearing the marks\r\n  of Smallpox is now of extremely rare occurrence.\r\n\r\n  To what can the freedom from the vestiges of so loathsome a\r\n  disease be attributed, but to the protecting influence of\r\n  Vaccination? for Variolation has now been disused by all\r\n  respectable practitioners for some time past.\r\n\r\n  1837.--The rarity of an example of disfigurement by Smallpox\r\n  now to be found in the theatres, in churches, or in any large\r\n  assemblage of the people, affords proof that Vaccination has lost\r\n  none of its efficacy.\r\n\r\nPock-marked faces are by no means uncommon at this day in London,\r\nthough their number has diminished through more careful nursing\r\nand the use of well-known means for preventing disfigurement; and\r\nwhoever cares to pursue the inquiry will discover that the majority\r\nof the marked have been vaccinated and many re-vaccinated--a proof\r\nthat it is not the rite which prevents the scars.\r\n\r\nThe general impression we derive from the reports of the\r\nEstablishment, 1808-40, is that they proceeded from men who\r\nwere committed to vaccination, but had no profound faith in its\r\nefficacy; who were averse from the admission of its impotence,\r\nand ultimately held by it as possibly the best available defence\r\nagainst smallpox. With ample means and opportunities for\r\ninvestigation, they made no discovery, nor achieved any advance in\r\npractice, nor apparently conceived that there was either discovery\r\nor advance to be made. They accepted smallpox as a mysterious\r\nordinance of Nature, with cowpox for a probable antidote, and there\r\nstuck fast, thoughtless and helpless. They did not even observe\r\nthat smallpox was specially a disease of the young and the poor,\r\nnor deduce conclusions therefrom. They had their money, and went\r\nthrough an appropriate routine, and there their action ended.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[275] _History and Practice of Vaccination_, p. 223.\r\n\r\n[276] _History and Practice of Vaccination_, p. 226.\r\n\r\n[277] Baron’s _Life of Jenner_, vol. ii., p. 398.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\nTHE NATIONAL VACCINE ESTABLISHMENT--1841-50.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlong with the prohibition of Variolous Inoculation in 1840,\r\nParliament passed an Act for the provision of Vaccination out of\r\nthe poor-rate. A scheme had been formulated and petitioned for\r\nby the Provincial Medical and Surgical Association in 1838, with\r\nthe expectation that the Government might be induced to create\r\na multitude of places for “regularly educated vaccinators, with\r\nsuitable salaries, in districts sufficiently numerous to embrace\r\nthe whole of the poor population of the country.” The House of\r\nCommons being of a thrifty turn in those days, did not however\r\nfavour such a magnificent development of place and pay under\r\nthe National Vaccine Establishment, and disposed of the project\r\nby referring the provision of vaccination to the parochial\r\nauthorities, who might be trusted to do what was needful with due\r\nregard to economy. In every union, and in every parish that was\r\nnot in union, it was provided that there should be one or more\r\nmedical practitioners appointed by the Guardians for the gratuitous\r\nvaccination of the inhabitants, with remuneration from the rates\r\naccording to the number operated upon.[278] This accession to\r\ntheir burdens met with anything but welcome from the ratepayers\r\nin general. Contracts for vaccination at so much per head were\r\nsubmitted for competition, and those who accepted the rite at the\r\npublic expense were spoken of as paupers, and in some places had\r\ntheir names published to “shame them.” To remove the stigma of\r\npauperism from the parish prophylaxy, an Act was passed in 1841 in\r\nwhich it was declared that public vaccination was not of the nature\r\nof “parochial relief, alms, or charitable allowance,” and did not\r\ntherefore deprive the recipient of any “right or privilege,” or\r\nsubject him “to any disability or disqualification whatsoever.”[279]\r\n\r\nThe reports of the National Vaccine Establishment from 1841 to 1850\r\ncontinued to be of the same perfunctory character. They usually\r\nstarted with a profession of confidence in vaccination, after the\r\nfashion of Mrs. Micawber’s resolution never to desert Micawber; the\r\nsignature to which declaration by the President and Senior Censor\r\nof the Royal College of Physicians, and the President of the Royal\r\nCollege of Surgeons being accompanied with a douceur of £100 to\r\neach. For example, we read--\r\n\r\n  1841.--Smallpox has prevailed epidemically with considerable\r\n  severity since our last Report; but we do not abate an iota of\r\n  our confidence in Vaccination as the best protective against its\r\n  malignant influence.\r\n\r\n  1845.--The unabated confidence with which we continue to regard\r\n  Vaccination, etc., etc.\r\n\r\n  1847.--Nothing has occurred to diminish our confidence in the\r\n  protective influence of Vaccination. It is true that Smallpox\r\n  has now and then reappeared; and lately to an extent which has\r\n  called for additional efforts on the part of all the officers of\r\n  the Establishment; but we regard such recurrence as due to the\r\n  ordinary operations of those periodical influences which give to\r\n  the disease its epidemic character; and in some localities, as in\r\n  Ireland, to that distress with which contagious diseases are so\r\n  invariably associated.\r\n\r\nThe reporters apparently forgot that according to the doctrine\r\nof which they were the representatives, vaccination excluded the\r\npossibility of smallpox under whatever circumstances of atmosphere,\r\nfilth, or privation. If only effective in the absence of the\r\nordinary conditions of smallpox, wherein consisted the benefit of\r\nthe rite?\r\n\r\nCeely of Aylesbury in 1839, and Badcock of Brighton in 1840,\r\nsucceeded in inoculating cows with smallpox, and the resulting\r\nvirus was described as cowpox, and used for vaccination far and\r\nwide. Apparently the procedure was not approved by the Vaccine\r\nEstablishment, for we read in the report--\r\n\r\n  1841.--The matter we employ is obtained by succession from the\r\n  original virus communicated by Dr. Jenner himself, and that we\r\n  find is as effectual as ever. We may be excused therefore, we\r\n  hope, if we discourage an incautious dissemination of matter\r\n  obtained from new sources, which has not stood the test of ample\r\n  experience.\r\n\r\nThe original virus communicated by Jenner himself! What was it?\r\nWhen the National Vaccine Establishment was instituted in 1808,\r\nthe virus in circulation in London was accepted as stock, and\r\nit certainly had several origins. It was cowpox as discovered\r\nby Pearson; it was horsegrease cowpox and horsepox as derived\r\nfrom Jenner; and there is reason to believe it was smallpox from\r\nWoodville and others. The claim, therefore, to the possession of a\r\nspecific variety of matter communicated by Jenner was fictitious.\r\n\r\nAgain, through the recurrent failure of vaccination to avert\r\nsmallpox, the Board had to discountenance the assertion that their\r\nvirus had lost its virtue through prolonged transmission--a reason\r\nwhich led some to prefer the fresh variolous stocks of Ceely and\r\nBadcock--\r\n\r\n  1840.--The experience of another year has afforded proofs of the\r\n  propriety, in the present state of our knowledge, of preferring\r\n  Vaccine Matter, the produce of the original virus furnished by\r\n  Dr. Jenner, which has now passed happily through successive\r\n  generations of subjects in the course of 43 years, and which\r\n  forms the principal source of our supply, to any which may have\r\n  been recently taken from the cow.\r\n\r\nHere we have “the original virus furnished by Dr. Jenner” set forth\r\nas no more than “the _principal_ source of supply.” The reports are\r\ncharacterised by many similar inconsistencies--\r\n\r\n  1845.--We regard as erroneous the belief that Vaccine Virus\r\n  undergoes deterioration by being kept; in proof of which we are\r\n  prepared to establish, by unquestionable documents, the striking\r\n  fact, that Lymph which had been conveyed to and from India has\r\n  retained its protective properties wholly unimpaired after a\r\n  lapse of 20 years.\r\n\r\nAnother vexation of the Board was due to the assertion that the\r\nprotective virtues of vaccination gradually wore out, and that\r\nthe repetition of the rite was necessary for the maintenance of\r\nsalvation. In the _London Medical Gazette_, 2nd August, 1844, it\r\nwas proclaimed--\r\n\r\n  We are sorry to announce the extensive prevalence of Smallpox at\r\n  this time among us. REVACCINATE, REVACCINATE, say we.\r\n\r\nSuch advice was essentially heretical and damnable; for Jenner\r\naffirmed and maintained--\r\n\r\n  That the human frame, when once it has felt the influence of\r\n  the genuine Cowpox, is never afterwards, at any period of its\r\n  existence, assailable by Smallpox.\r\n\r\nIf revaccination were possible, smallpox after vaccination was\r\npossible; and if so much were conceded, on what ground was\r\nvaccination to be defended? Whatever the facts, the members of\r\nthe Board resolved to stand loyally by the primitive Jennerian\r\ndoctrine, and in their Report for 1851 thus testified--\r\n\r\n  It may be expedient to remind the public of the established fact\r\n  which the Board upon former occasions anxiously insisted upon,\r\n  that the restriction of the protective power of Vaccination to\r\n  any age, or to any term of years, is an hypothesis contradicted\r\n  by experience, and wholly unsupported by analogy.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the prohibition of Variolous Inoculation, the\r\nBoard had repeatedly to deplore its continuance especially in\r\nIreland. Thus we read--\r\n\r\n  1850.--The Board again entreat the attention of the Government to\r\n  the fact that Inoculation for the Smallpox still continues; and\r\n  that the disease is communicated by vagrants to those unprotected\r\n  by Vaccination in town and country. The contagion is carried\r\n  throughout the land by wandering Irish, and no care, however\r\n  great, can be successful in eradicating Smallpox, whilst the\r\n  neglect of Vaccination and the practice of Variolous Inoculation\r\n  are permitted in Ireland.\r\n\r\nIt was Jenner’s practice to attribute to wilful blindness and\r\ninnate depravity any scepticism as to the efficacy of vaccination;\r\nand throughout the Reports of the Establishment this habit of\r\nimputation was maintained. Vaccination was treated as a sort\r\nof divine revelation, plenary and manifest, which could only\r\nbe disputed or resisted from deliberate perversity, or, more\r\ncharitably, from abject dulness or ignorance; and it would be\r\neasy to construct a catena of piquant deliverances under this\r\nsemi-theological persuasion. Such observations as the following\r\nwere of the order of matter-of-course--\r\n\r\n  1850.--We regret to learn that in our own country the spread of\r\n  Vaccination is still materially impeded by influences emanating\r\n  from ignorance and prejudice in the lower orders, and from\r\n  prejudices in many who cannot plead the excuse of ignorance.\r\n\r\n  1851.--It is lamentable to observe not only the indifference, but\r\n  the active hostility displayed by the community to Vaccination.\r\n  Deeply-rooted prejudices and absurd superstitions are ever\r\n  opposing its adoption.\r\n\r\nThe Reports of the Establishment year after year displayed in\r\nfull measure the familiar complacency of official routine--where\r\npay is constant and wheels propelled from office desks revolve\r\nsmoothly in space--so many Londoners vaccinated, so many charges\r\nof virus distributed, and confidence in the sacred prophylactic\r\nunabated. A revolution was, however, impending. The attitude of\r\nthe public mind toward disease had become transformed. Faith in\r\nsanitation as a preventive of fevers had been created, and a\r\npopular demand for sanitary improvement had set in. Under cover of\r\nthis new enthusiasm some of the shrewder advocates of vaccination\r\nconjectured that it would be possible to effect its endowment\r\nand establishment on a scale hitherto unattempted in England. It\r\nwas true that vaccination had no relation to sanitation; but the\r\nreforming and philanthropic mob were madly in favour of whatever\r\nbore the promise of health, and were not likely to show themselves\r\nhypercritical or obstructive.\r\n\r\nThe first movement toward a new advance is discernible in the\r\nReport of the Establishment for 1850 wherein we read--\r\n\r\n  The Board have had to solicit the attention of Her Majesty’s\r\n  Government on several occasions to the deplorable fact that a\r\n  very large proportion of the children of the poorer classes\r\n  in the Metropolis, and in England and Wales generally, but\r\n  above all in Ireland, remain year by year without the benefit\r\n  of Vaccination. Their testimony on this important part of the\r\n  sanitary condition of the population has been derived from the\r\n  reports of numerous competent medical witnesses in all parts of\r\n  the United Kingdom, and from the frequent recurrence of rapid\r\n  and fatal invasions of Smallpox, to which their attention has\r\n  been repeatedly called by urgent applications for Vaccine Lymph.\r\n  It is satisfactory to find that the representations which the\r\n  Board have made are most unequivocally confirmed by the report of\r\n  Mr. Grainger, from which it appears that the number of persons\r\n  under one year who were vaccinated during the year ended 29th\r\n  September, 1848, in 627 Unions of parishes in England and Wales\r\n  (exclusive of those vaccinated at the cost of their parents)\r\n  amounted to no more than 33 per cent., compared with the total\r\n  number of births registered in the same period.\r\n\r\nThese figures are worth noting. Dating from 1840, an effort was\r\nmade to overtake the vaccination of the people by the agency of\r\nthe poor law; and yet so late as 1848, not more than one-third\r\nof the children born were accounted for as Jennerised. Adding to\r\nthis third the offspring of the upper and middle classes, we may\r\nsafely conclude that up to 1850 not half the inhabitants of England\r\nand Wales were vaccinated; and the unvaccinated half included the\r\nlower classes most subject to smallpox--victims of that “distress\r\nwith which contagious diseases are so invariably associated,” to\r\ncite the words of the Report for 1847. The point is especially\r\nworth noting because the decline of smallpox, which set in last\r\ncentury, is continually ascribed to vaccination. A true cause\r\nhowever must be commensurate with the effect; and yet here we see\r\nthe asserted cause of the fall in smallpox did not apply in 1848 to\r\nhalf the English people; in which half, moreover, lay nine-tenths\r\nof the field in which smallpox was possible. The Report for 1850\r\ncontinues--\r\n\r\n  The Board lament that they have no means of adopting or enforcing\r\n  such measures as are obviously necessary for the prevention of\r\n  Smallpox. They have no power of instituting domiciliary visits,\r\n  or house to house visitation; and indeed hitherto such have been\r\n  deemed too much of an encroachment on the liberty of the subject.\r\n  They have no power to punish officially the practice of illegal\r\n  Inoculation, or the exposure of infected persons; and they have\r\n  only had the means granted to them of prosecuting such offenders\r\n  in two cases, in order to establish the fact of the illegality of\r\n  Variolous Inoculation. They can only recommend and aid, but they\r\n  cannot enforce Vaccination.\r\n\r\n  The progress of Vaccination is more rapid in Foreign Countries\r\n  where municipal measures or legislative enactments are adopted\r\n  to promote its dissemination; and they beg to express their\r\n  conviction that if England is to be free from Smallpox, the\r\n  interposition of the Legislature alone, by wise and comprehensive\r\n  measures, can disarm the Pestilence of its terrors, and realise\r\n  the fond hopes and prayers of the Friends of Humanity for its\r\n  extinction.\r\n\r\nIn these observations is revealed the movement of a new spirit--of\r\na revived resolution to obtain for vaccination the force of\r\nlaw. Similar projects had from time to time been advanced by\r\nenthusiasts, and swept aside by statesmen. Canning, for instance,\r\nhad declared that he could not imagine any circumstances\r\nwhatever that would induce him to consent to the compulsory\r\ninfliction of vaccination; and, at a later date, Sir Robert Peel\r\nexpressed himself to like effect, saying, “To make vaccination\r\ncompulsory, as in some despotic countries, would be so opposite\r\nto the mental habits of the British people, and the freedom of\r\nopinion wherein they rightly glory, that I never could be a\r\nparty to such compulsion.”[280] But Peel died in 1850, and a\r\nstrong public opinion in favour of sanitary reform had come into\r\nexistence without much scruple as to methods. Diseases, hitherto\r\nregarded as supernatural inflictions, were traced to conditions\r\nof life, remediable or avertible; so that the submission and\r\nterror which sickness formerly inspired gave place to widely\r\ndifferent sentiments--a temper of intolerance with illness, and\r\na determination to extirpate its infectious forms with those who\r\nin ignorance or wilfulness should persist in their generation and\r\ndiffusion.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[278] 3 & 4 Vict., cap. 59.\r\n\r\n[279] 4 & 5 Vict., cap. 32.\r\n\r\n[280] _Report of Royal Jennerian and London Vaccine Institution_,\r\n1853.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\nVACCINATION ENFORCED--1853.\r\n\r\n\r\nVaccination, it will be objected, had no connection with sanitary\r\nreform. True: it had none; but the dull public when possessed with\r\na new enthusiasm is not apt to discriminate; and those who had an\r\ninterest in pushing vaccination found their operations facilitated\r\nby the rising faith in the preventibility of disease; their promise\r\nof saving the country from smallpox seeming of a piece with much\r\nelse that had become credible.\r\n\r\nYet, strange to say, the credit of vaccination had never fallen\r\nlower than prior to its enforcement. The proof is written at large\r\nin the reports of the National Vaccine Establishment from 1831 to\r\n1850, which it is difficult to peruse without perceiving them to\r\nbe the testimonies of half-hearted officials to a generation grown\r\nsceptical and indifferent. The medical literature of the time\r\nreflects the same uncertainty and doubt. Vaccination was admitted\r\nto be no sure defence against smallpox: it might, it probably did,\r\nmitigate the disease when it occurred; and, in the absence of\r\nanything better, its practice was advisable; but on such terms,\r\nwhat scope was there for its advocacy! In the writings of Dr.\r\nGeorge Gregory, this scepticism is so pronounced, that he scarcely\r\nhesitates to recommend a reversion to inoculation with smallpox.\r\nA like scepticism as to the virtue of vaccination with a like\r\ndisposition to return to variolous inoculation, is exhibited by Dr.\r\nCopland in his _Dictionary of Practical Medicine_, 1844-58--a work\r\nof high repute, and the standard of medical opinion for the time.\r\nIn short, vaccination was subject to general distrust; every claim\r\nmade for it had been belied; and except for its endowment by the\r\nState, and the determination of sundry adventurers to have that\r\nendowment enlarged, the practice would gradually have fallen into\r\ndisuse.\r\n\r\nThe same absence of confidence in vaccination was conspicuous in\r\nthe school of sanitary reformers. It was of the essence of their\r\nrevelation that smallpox was as preventible as other fevers, and\r\nby the same methods. I might, indeed, challenge any one to produce\r\naught from the utterances of the early apostles of sanitation in\r\ndeliberate or explicit praise of vaccination. The prescription\r\nmight not be formally condemned; it might even be cursorily\r\napproved; but it was foreign to the tenor of their doctrine, and\r\nits recommendation must have died in their throats. Dr. Southwood\r\nSmith delivered two lectures in Edinburgh in 1855 on the Prevention\r\nof Epidemics, but of smallpox as preventible by vaccination he\r\nsaid not a word. On the contrary, this was his testimony, his all\r\ninclusive testimony--\r\n\r\n  Overcrowding we can prevent; the accumulation of filth in towns\r\n  and houses we can prevent; the supply of light, air, and water,\r\n  together with the several other appliances included in the\r\n  all-comprehensive word CLEANLINESS, we can secure. To the extent\r\n  to which it is in our power to do this, it is in our power to\r\n  prevent epidemics.\r\n\r\n  The human family have now lived in communities more than\r\n  six thousand years, yet they have not learnt to make their\r\n  habitations clean. At last we are beginning to learn the lesson.\r\n  When we shall have mastered it, we shall have conquered epidemics.\r\n\r\nAmong the upper and middle classes distrust in vaccination was\r\ngeneral. How, indeed, could it be otherwise? All were vaccinated,\r\nyet whenever smallpox was epidemic, recipients of the rite\r\nenjoyed no immunity. In one of Miss Mitford’s letters we find an\r\nexperience and a judgment which were far from uncommon. Writing,\r\n1st February, 1850, she observed--\r\n\r\n  About two months ago, my man, a very steady and respectable\r\n  servant, was seized with Smallpox after Vaccination. He was very,\r\n  very ill, delirious nearly a fortnight, and not a nurse could\r\n  be had for love or money. I have lost all faith in Vaccination,\r\n  either as preventing or mitigating Smallpox. I know of thirty\r\n  severe cases this winter, five of them fatal, in my own immediate\r\n  neighbourhood, and in Reading it has been a pestilence.[281]\r\n\r\nVaccination among the poor was (as it is) detested. Coaxed or\r\nforced into its reception without consideration or preparation,\r\nlike sheep or cattle, they realised its mischiefs and misery in\r\nfull measure; and naturally, whenever pressure was relaxed, avoided\r\nits acquaintance.\r\n\r\nHow then did vaccination come to be imposed upon a community thus\r\naffected? The answer is the usual one, illustrated continually\r\nin English politics: an organised interest, possessed with a\r\ndefinite intention, can always prevail over the public--careless,\r\nuninstructed, and without positive conviction. Under such\r\ncircumstances, it is a mere question of management what may be\r\nachieved in Parliament at variance with the common welfare. Those\r\nthere get, who know how to take.\r\n\r\nAll trades and professions fulfil the law of their being in\r\nstriving after advantage and extension. The clergy and the\r\nclerically-minded laity are persuaded that to multiply churches and\r\nprovide stipends, is to prepare for the millennium, and nothing\r\nsave hopelessness prevents demands upon the national exchequer for\r\nthe purpose. The sacrifices the army and navy would exact on their\r\nown behalf for security from foreign aggression are only limited\r\nby the public incredulity. The commercial classes are free-traders\r\nin principle; but if a protective bounty could be had for any\r\nmanufacture, it would be instantly grasped at by those concerned,\r\nand most ingenious reasons invented to justify that particular\r\ndeparture from the rule of justice. This tendency of interests to\r\naggrandise themselves, _per fas et nefas_, at the public expense,\r\nis recognised by all statesmen, and is only kept in check by\r\nperpetual vigilance.\r\n\r\nWhat is true of all, is true of the medical profession, crowded\r\nwith competitors eager for employment. Vaccination as a branch\r\nof business, capable of development and endowment at the public\r\ncost, was certain of vigorous promotion whenever there was\r\nopportunity; but not until 1853 did the way open for the compulsory\r\ninfliction of the Jennerian rite. The undertaking was hazardous.\r\nThe opposition to which Canning and Peel had given expression, had\r\nto be circumspectly encountered. It was a job that might easily\r\nbe wrecked; and therefore it was considered inexpedient that the\r\nmedical corporations should appear too openly in the transaction.\r\nInstead, a committee was formed in 1850 under the title of\r\n“The Epidemiological Society for the Investigation of Epidemic\r\nDiseases,” with a number of suitable decoys, and ostensible\r\noccupation; but chiefly designed as an instrument wherewith to\r\noperate on Parliament for the better establishment and more liberal\r\nendowment of vaccination.\r\n\r\nIt was resolved to proceed tentatively--to secure if possible the\r\naffirmation of compulsion, allowing the shock of innovation to\r\nsubside before going on to provide the effective means of espionage\r\nand persecution. As it turned out, the caution exercised was\r\nsuperfluous. Much more might have been demanded and conceded of the\r\nignorance and indifference of the legislature. Lord Lyttelton was\r\nselected to introduce what was called the Vaccination Extension\r\nBill, and in moving the second reading in the House of Lords on\r\n12th April, he ingenuously disowned any qualification for the task,\r\nsaying--\r\n\r\n  I have no scientific knowledge of the subject myself, and for\r\n  my information I am indebted to some able and learned persons\r\n  belonging to the Epidemiological Society--\r\n\r\nAdding in proof of the manner in which he had been crammed by the\r\nsaid “able and learned persons”--\r\n\r\n  It is unnecessary for me to speak of the certainty of Vaccination\r\n  as a preventive of Smallpox, that being a point on which _the\r\n  whole medical profession have arrived at complete unanimity_!\r\n\r\nThe statistics with which Lord Lyttelton supported the necessity\r\nfor compulsion are interesting as indicating the extent and\r\nirregularity of vaccination among the English people. He said--\r\n\r\n  We are told that the number of births registered in England and\r\n  Wales in the year ending 29th September, 1852, was 601,839, and\r\n  the number vaccinated under the Act of 1840 was 397,128; so that,\r\n  in round numbers, 400,000 were vaccinated by the machinery in\r\n  force, leaving only 200,000, or one-third of the whole number, to\r\n  be treated by private vaccination. There are several fallacies in\r\n  that statement. The general result is by no means the consequence\r\n  of anything like a uniform system throughout the country. I have\r\n  before me a detailed statement of the extent of Vaccination in\r\n  various parts of England in 1851, which shows there is great\r\n  want of uniformity in certain districts. In towns where people\r\n  have a shorter distance to go to get their children vaccinated,\r\n  the result is more favourable than in the rural districts. For\r\n  example, in Birmingham, on the total number of births in 1851,\r\n  the vaccinations were 91 per cent.; in Leicester they were only\r\n  41 per cent.; and in Loughborough only 18 per cent. The contrast\r\n  between the manufacturing and the rural districts is favourable\r\n  on the side of the former. In Bideford, the vaccinations were\r\n  only 11 per cent. upon the births; in West Ashford in Kent,\r\n  they were only 22 per cent.; and in Winchcomb only 6 per cent.\r\n  While the general average is lower in the agricultural than in\r\n  the manufacturing districts, some contrary instances are found.\r\n  Thus in Derby the vaccinations are only 42 per cent.; while at\r\n  Watford, which is a rural district, the vaccinations were 126 per\r\n  cent. upon the births in 1851--which included, of course, the\r\n  vaccination of children born in previous years. But in London,\r\n  and in no less a parish than that of St. James, Westminster, it\r\n  is reported that in 1851 on 973 births only 44 vaccinations took\r\n  place; while in Wellingborough Union, where there were 800 births\r\n  in 1851, no vaccination at all is reported!\r\n\r\nStrange to say, Lord Lyttelton made no attempt to complete\r\nhis argument. He ought to have shown that in the places where\r\nvaccination was least practised there was most smallpox, and where\r\nmost practised there was least smallpox. Had he made the attempt,\r\nhis eyes might have been opened to the untrustworthy character of\r\n“the able and learned person” by whom he had been mendaciously\r\nprimed.\r\n\r\nLord Shaftesbury, in supporting the measure, adduced similar\r\ninstances of neglected vaccination as follows--\r\n\r\n                    Births 1851.   Vaccinations.\r\n    Paddington            1458          386\r\n    Hampstead              286           93\r\n    Huntingdon             805           68\r\n    St. Neots              671           17\r\n    Carnarvon              929          125\r\n    Bangor and Beaumaris  1025          420\r\n    Newton Abbott         1563          150\r\n\r\nHe, too, forgot to show that these places were “decimated” (that’s\r\nthe word) with smallpox, whilst other places where vaccination\r\nwas generally practised enjoyed exemption. On the contrary, with\r\ncurious inconsequence, he went on to recommend a sure prescription\r\nof his own, namely, improved dwellings for the poor. These were his\r\nwords--\r\n\r\n  It is perfectly true that Smallpox is chiefly confined to\r\n  the lowest classes of the population; and I believe that\r\n  _with improved lodging-houses, the disease might be all but\r\n  exterminated_.\r\n\r\nNot a doubt of it; but if improved lodging-houses would “all\r\nbut exterminate smallpox,” why resort to such a superfluity as\r\nvaccination?\r\n\r\nThere was no adverse discussion--indeed, no discussion whatever.\r\nLord Ellenborough observed of the Epidemiological Society, under\r\nwhose direction they were legislating, that he “would not adventure\r\nupon the extraordinary name by which the members are designated.”\r\nThe bill was read for the third time, _nem. diss._, on 18th April,\r\nand was introduced to the House of Commons on 5th May, where its\r\ncourse was as uninterrupted as in the Lords. Sir John Pakington, in\r\nmoving the second reading on 20th July, pleaded like Lord Lyttelton\r\nhis own ignorance, and the evidence and authority of the Society\r\nwith “the extraordinary name,” thus stating the case--\r\n\r\n  An Act was passed in 1840, by which Boards of Guardians were\r\n  authorised to defray the expenses of Vaccination in their\r\n  respective unions. The Poor Law Board have done all in their\r\n  power to carry out the provisions of the Act; but still the\r\n  grave fact remains, that the system is voluntary: that in many\r\n  places the people are prejudiced; that a large proportion of the\r\n  population is not vaccinated; and that mortality from Smallpox\r\n  exists to a very great extent. In the year ending March, 1843\r\n  out of 527,325 born in England and Wales, only 183,000 or 34 per\r\n  cent. were vaccinated. In the succeeding years the vaccinated\r\n  stood to the unvaccinated in the following ratio:--\r\n\r\n    1844-45,   100 to 156\r\n    1845-46,   100 to 134\r\n\r\n  In 1846-47 the births were 552,000 of which only 267,000 were\r\n  vaccinated, or about 50 per cent. of the whole. In consequence,\r\n  however, of stimulus applied by the Poor Law Board, two-thirds of\r\n  the births in 1847-48 were accounted for as vaccinated; but still\r\n  in many parts there prevails excessive neglect. For example, so\r\n  late as 1851 in 32 unions in and around Birmingham, the births\r\n  were 17,700 while the vaccinations were only 6,174--two-thirds\r\n  being unvaccinated.\r\n\r\nHere, too, we note the omission of proof, that where vaccination\r\nwas neglected smallpox was prevalent, and where practised smallpox\r\nwas absent. Lord Palmerston supported the second reading without\r\nhesitation. Sir George Strickland was the only dissentient, saying--\r\n\r\n  Sir John Pakington has himself supplied the strongest reason\r\n  why the bill should not pass. He has shown that Vaccination as\r\n  at present conducted is working well; but because some mothers\r\n  object to the practice, we are to be saddled with a compulsory\r\n  law. We are too prone to resort to force to overcome resistance,\r\n  which would yield to reason with the exercise of patience. What\r\n  need is there that we should imitate the legislation of Saxony,\r\n  or Austria, or Prussia in such a matter? In this country we\r\n  cannot have one law for the poor and another for the rich, and\r\n  yet here we are asked to apply a measure to the former which we\r\n  could not think of for the latter. How can we expect to abate\r\n  prejudice against Vaccination by compulsion? If we acted more\r\n  on the old English principle of leaving people to secure their\r\n  welfare by their own good sense, we should in the end achieve our\r\n  purpose much more successfully.\r\n\r\nThe bill was read, for the third time in the House of Commons\r\nwithout debate on the 13th, and received the royal assent on 20th\r\nAugust, 1853. In short, it passed through Parliament without\r\nopposition. What, it will be asked, were its provisions?\r\n\r\nBy the Act (16 and 17 Vict. cap. 100) it was required--\r\n\r\n  1. That every child, whose health permits, shall be vaccinated\r\n  within three, or in case of orphanage within four months of\r\n  birth, by the public vaccinator of the district, or by some other\r\n  medical practitioner.\r\n\r\n  2. That notice of this requirement, and information as to the\r\n  local arrangements for public vaccination, shall, whenever a\r\n  birth is registered, be given by the registrar of births to the\r\n  parents or guardians of the child.\r\n\r\n  3. That every medical practitioner who, whether in public or\r\n  private practice, successfully vaccinates a child shall send to\r\n  the local registrar of births a certificate that he has done so;\r\n  and the registrar shall keep a minute of all the notices given,\r\n  and an account of all the certificates thus received.\r\n\r\n  4. That parents or guardians who, without sufficient reason,\r\n  after having duly received the registrar’s notice of the\r\n  requirement of Vaccination, either omit to have a child duly\r\n  vaccinated, or, this being done, omit to have it inspected as to\r\n  the results of Vaccination, shall be liable to a penalty of £1;\r\n  and all penalties shall be recoverable under Jervis’s Act, and\r\n  shall be paid toward the local poor-rate.\r\n\r\nThus from 1853 every English parent became liable to a fine of\r\ntwenty shillings and costs who refused or neglected to have\r\nhis child vaccinated within three months of birth. It may seem\r\nsurprising that an Act so arbitrary, enforcing an indefinite\r\nmedical prescription (for Vaccination was _not_ defined, and\r\nVaccination _is_ a rite of several varieties) should have been\r\npassed so lightly; but we have to recollect the circumstances.\r\nThe House of Commons in those days was the house of the upper and\r\nmiddle classes, and was as little affected as the House of Lords\r\nitself by the proposed legislation. It was an Act for application\r\nto the vulgar--to the prejudiced, whose prejudices were to be\r\nencountered, not with arguments, but with fines; an illustration of\r\nthe levity with which the unconcerned can dispose of the opinions\r\nand feelings of those to whom they owe no allegiance. Since that\r\ntime the working-classes have plainly discovered that they only\r\nobtain consideration in Parliament in so far as they can make\r\ntheir power felt in the constitution of Parliament. No rights are\r\nsecure that cannot be enforced, nor any justice certain that cannot\r\nbe vindicated. Those who hold their ground by any other tenure\r\nthan their own intelligence and vigour are liable to continual\r\nimposition and depredation.\r\n\r\n      The good old rule, the simple plan,\r\n        That they should take who have the power,\r\n      And they should keep who can--\r\n\r\nis the abiding social law, however veiled or elevated in\r\napplication.\r\n\r\nAgain we have to recollect, that in 1853 there was no developed or\r\nscientific resistance to vaccination. As to the nature and value of\r\nthe practice there was wide diversity of opinion, notwithstanding\r\nLord Lyttelton’s affirmation of the complete unanimity of the\r\nmedical profession; but although such scepticism was general, the\r\nrite constituted an established poll-tax among the respectable\r\nclasses, which sort of thing is never readily surrendered. Hence\r\nit seemed less unreasonable to enforce the like observance on “the\r\nignorant and prejudiced” at the cost of the poor-rate. When Canning\r\nrefused to consent to compulsion in 1808, cowpox had a competitor\r\nin smallpox inoculation; and Peel in his later protest expressed\r\nthe preference of an expiring generation for living English\r\nliberty over cut-and-dry subservience. Despotic philanthropy was\r\ncoming into vogue, and it was no longer thought impracticable or\r\ninexpedient to do good to people in spite of themselves. There was\r\ntherefore little to be said against the Act of 1853 beyond what\r\nSir George Strickland expressed. The right of the prejudiced and\r\nignorant to the enjoyment of their prejudice and ignorance had\r\nbecome obsolete and indefensible.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Epidemiological Society was taken as the warrant\r\nfor the Act of 1853 alike by the Lords and Commons. Turning to\r\nthat report,[282] it is difficult in a few words to convey an\r\nadequate idea of its untruthful character. Whoever, it is said,\r\nwills the end wills the means; and certain medical men having\r\nresolved to make vaccination compulsory whatever was requisite had\r\nto be accomplished; and Dr. Seaton undertook the operation, the\r\nEpidemiological Society, of which he was “the ruling spirit”,[283]\r\nplaying the part of guarantee. For the persuasion of the Lords\r\nand Commons, an advocacy of vaccination without hesitation or\r\nqualification was deemed advisable, and the line was thus followed\r\nup--\r\n\r\n  Smallpox is a disease to which every person is liable who is\r\n  not protected by a previous attack or by Vaccination. In its\r\n  unmodified form it is fatal to about one in four or one in five\r\n  of all whom it invades; and, when it does not destroy life, it\r\n  in many cases disfigures and deteriorates the general health.\r\n  Every case of it is a centre of contagion, and every unvaccinated\r\n  or imperfectly vaccinated population is a nidus for the disease\r\n  to settle in and propagate itself. It is on the two latter\r\n  propositions, which do not admit of being controverted, that we\r\n  conceive any enactment for rendering Vaccination compulsory must\r\n  be based. If it admit of doubt how far it is justifiable in this\r\n  free country to compel a person to take care of his own life and\r\n  that of his offspring, it can scarcely be disputed that no one\r\n  has a right to put in jeopardy the lives of his fellow-subjects.\r\n\r\nAll will recognise the authoritative air of the foregoing, so\r\nimpressive where nothing better is known; but the indisputable\r\nproposition, “that no one has a right to put in jeopardy the lives\r\nof his fellow-subjects,” was curiously inconsistent with faith in\r\nthe asserted prophylactic; for if the vaccinated were secure from\r\nsmallpox, how could the unvaccinated place their lives in jeopardy?\r\nThe style assumed was thus maintained--\r\n\r\n  We are ourselves satisfied, and it is the concurrent and\r\n  unanimous testimony of nearly 2,000 medical men with whom we have\r\n  been in correspondence, that Vaccination is a perfectly safe and\r\n  efficient prophylactic against this disease.\r\n\r\n  This proposition we hold to be proved--\r\n\r\n  1. By the general immunity with which it is found that those who\r\n  have been vaccinated can mingle with Smallpox patients, a fact so\r\n  familiar that we do not feel that we need adduce any illustration\r\n  of it.\r\n\r\n  2. By the gradual decrease which has taken place in the mortality\r\n  from Smallpox, as compared with the mortality from all causes,\r\n  since Vaccination has been introduced and been generally received.\r\n\r\nAs to the immunity of the vaccinated, it was disproved in every\r\nsmallpox epidemic, and in every smallpox hospital, and by the\r\nprecautions and terrors of those accounted secure. To sustain the\r\nproposition that smallpox had decreased in consequence of the\r\nintroduction of vaccination, a variety of statistical tables were\r\nadduced, English and Continental; but had the Lords or Commons\r\nsubjected them to scrutiny they would have discovered that the\r\ndetails were either irrelevant or adverse to the conclusion\r\nasserted. Many of the statistics, especially of last century, were\r\nnot certainties, but conjectures and estimates, vitiated, too,\r\nwith the bias of their compilers. When it is said that smallpox\r\ndecreased in consequence of the introduction of vaccination, the\r\nanswer is that smallpox was decreasing prior to its introduction\r\nin almost every country of Europe; and that the decrease continued\r\nirrespective of its influence, save in so far as it might have\r\ndiscouraged the culture of smallpox by inoculation. To illustrate\r\nthis contention it may suffice to take the table of London Smallpox\r\nset forth by Dr. Seaton, in which the average of deaths from\r\nSmallpox in every 1000 deaths from all causes was contrasted in\r\ndecennial periods for fifty years, prior and subsequent to the\r\nintroduction of vaccination.\r\n\r\n    PRIOR TO VACCINATION.\r\n\r\n                         Deaths from\r\n    Ten Years ending--    Smallpox.\r\n        1760                100\r\n        1770                108\r\n        1780                 98\r\n        1790                 87\r\n        1800                 88\r\n\r\n    SUBSEQUENT TO VACCINATION.\r\n\r\n                         Deaths from\r\n    Ten Years ending--    Smallpox\r\n        1810                 64\r\n        1820                 42\r\n        1830                 32\r\n        1840                 23\r\n        1850                 16\r\n\r\nThe figures are far from trustworthy, but taking them as they\r\nstand, and admitting the decline, where was the proof that it\r\nwas due to vaccination? The introduction of that practice was\r\none thing: its application quite another. There was no reason to\r\nbelieve that more Londoners were vaccinated in 1820 than in 1810,\r\nor in 1840 than in 1830; indeed, the available evidence went to\r\nthe contrary, vaccination having fallen in repute after the\r\nfurore of 1801-5, and the demonstration of its impotence and its\r\ninjuriousness. Probably not ten per cent. of the births in London\r\nup to 1840 were accounted for as vaccinated; and notwithstanding\r\nthe provision of vaccination at the cost of the poor-rate by the\r\nAct of 1840, not fifty per cent. in 1850. Yet to a cause so utterly\r\ninadequate, the steady decline in London Smallpox was ascribed! The\r\nsame fallacy pervaded the statistics of other countries and cities,\r\nyet so strong was the prepossession in favour of the conclusion\r\ndetermined upon, that it was apparently neither seen nor suspected,\r\nobvious though it was.\r\n\r\nNor was it surprising that with a disposition so fixed and obtuse,\r\nno enlarged or philosophic views should have been entertained.\r\n“Smallpox,” said Dr. Seaton, “had decreased compared with\r\nmortality from other causes.” True; but what if mortality from\r\nother causes had compensated for the decrease of smallpox? and if\r\nsuch compensation had taken place, as, for example, in Glasgow,\r\nin what consisted the advantage? Again, no reference was made to\r\nillness and death resulting from vaccination, as if the rite were\r\nharmless as baptism. Allowing that the practice did in some occult\r\nfashion tend to the abatement of smallpox, it was still open to\r\nquestion whether the infliction of an acute specific disease on\r\nall sorts and conditions of infancy was not likely to be far more\r\ninjurious to life than the smallpox it was supposed to avert.\r\nSuch considerations, however, were foreign to Dr. Seaton and his\r\nEpidemiological Society with whom vaccination stood for little else\r\nthan an extension of medical business at the public cost.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be forgotten that the Act of 1853 brought to fruition\r\nwhat was long hankered after by the trade spirit of the medical\r\nprofession. The Act of 1840 endowed vaccination out of the\r\npoor-rate; but to make the rite compulsory and to ensure good pay\r\nfor its performance was the consummation desired. The terms and\r\nconditions that ensued on the Act of 1840 are thus described by Dr.\r\nSeaton--\r\n\r\n  The fee paid in England and Wales varies from 1s. to 2s. 6d.,\r\n  never falling below or rising above those sums. In 1842 and 1843,\r\n  the Commissioners estimated the average fee at 1s. 9d. From our\r\n  inquiries, it appears that in the large manufacturing towns the\r\n  fee varies from 1s. to 1s. 6d.; the larger sums of 2s. and 2s.\r\n  6d. being paid for the most part in country towns. In London,\r\n  the more ordinary fee is 1s. 6d.; in several parishes 2s. 6d. is\r\n  paid; and in one, 1s. In some few unions a bad principle obtains\r\n  of paying a larger sum for a certain number of cases, as 50, and\r\n  a smaller sum for all above. The average payment per case for the\r\n  whole of England and Wales from 1841 to 1851 inclusive, was 1s.\r\n  5½d.\r\n\r\n  In Ireland, the payment appears to be very low. The more general\r\n  sum is 1s., often 6d.; in three or four instances, 3d. and 4d.\r\n  The vicious principle just noticed, of paying a higher fee for\r\n  a limited number of cases, seems to be almost universal. Thus,\r\n  where 1s. is the fee, this is paid for the first 200 cases, and\r\n  6d. for all above. In one case, Nenagh, 1s. is paid up to 200,\r\n  and 1d. for all above. In other cases, 3d. and 4d. are paid for\r\n  all above a certain number. Whilst this pitiful remuneration\r\n  exists, it is not surprising to find that in many districts the\r\n  medical practitioners decline the appointment, leaving the people\r\n  unvaccinated.\r\n\r\n  According to the information we have received, it is found, as\r\n  might be anticipated, that on the whole Vaccination is more\r\n  efficiently carried out in the districts where the higher fee\r\n  of 2s. 6d. is paid; or where, as in large towns, the number and\r\n  proximity of children compensate the vaccinator in some degree\r\n  for lower payment.\r\n\r\nThe better pay, the better vaccination! The object of the\r\nEpidemiological Society, as the stalking-horse of the medical\r\ntrades-unions, lay in those fees. Vaccination was a pretext for\r\na universal poll-tax, set at as high a figure as practicable,\r\nto be succeeded when possible by compulsory revaccination, with\r\na correspondent tariff annexed. Recalling the early days of\r\nvaccination when the operation was described as simplicity itself,\r\nand when women, parsons, and busybodies inoculated and propagated\r\n“the benign fluid” under Jenner’s authority, it was remarkable to\r\nhave the rite thus formalised and converted into the peculium of a\r\npriesthood. Nor can it be objected that when vaccination was thus\r\npractised, it was ineffective against smallpox; for whenever its\r\nvirtue is brought into dispute, we are referred to those primitive\r\ntimes and that primitive practice for the most successful and\r\nunquestionable exhibitions of its power.\r\n\r\n_Caveat emptor_ is a well-recognised caution, which to avoid\r\nwas the purpose of the Epidemiological Society. A mercantile\r\ntransaction was carried out under the cloak of impartial science.\r\nNo reader of Seaton’s report could suppose otherwise than that\r\nvaccination was universally regarded as an infallible preventive\r\nof smallpox, and that if by any means the English people could be\r\nsubjected to its observance, they would obtain immunity from the\r\ndisease. Evidence to the contrary was kept out of sight; and yet\r\nevidence to the contrary lay within the knowledge of every medical\r\nman; and proof might be adduced to weariness from contemporary\r\nmedical literature to show that in this respect the Epidemiological\r\nreport was contrived to blind and mislead Parliament. As a witness,\r\nnone will impugn Sir Henry Holland, and writing in 1839 he\r\nobserved--\r\n\r\n  Not only in Great Britain, but throughout every part of the\r\n  globe, we find that Smallpox has been gradually increasing in\r\n  frequency as an epidemic; affecting a larger proportion of the\r\n  vaccinated; and inflicting greater mortality in its results.\r\n\r\n  The early enthusiasm for the great discovery of Jenner swept\r\n  doubts away; and they returned only tardily, and under the\r\n  compulsion of facts.... Any explanation from the ignorant or\r\n  imperfect performance of Vaccination was found insufficient to\r\n  meet the number and variety of the proofs. And, though more\r\n  palpable at one time than another, according to the greater or\r\n  less prevalence of epidemic causes, yet every succeeding year\r\n  has multiplied them, and every statement from other countries\r\n  attested their truth.\r\n\r\n  It is no longer expedient, in any sense, to argue for the present\r\n  practice of Vaccination as a certain or permanent preventive of\r\n  Smallpox. The truth must be told, as it is, that the earlier\r\n  anticipations on this point have not been realised.... Whether\r\n  Smallpox may ever be wholly eradicated is a very doubtful\r\n  question, and the probability is on the negative side.[284]\r\n\r\nIn statements like these, Dr. Holland did no more than express the\r\ncontemporary conviction of the medical profession. Vaccination\r\nwas not surrendered: whilst it was allowed that it could not be\r\ntrusted to prevent smallpox, it was held that it made the disease\r\nmilder, and that whilst its prophylaxy wore out, it was renewable\r\nby revaccination. Obvious it was that vaccination thus qualified\r\ncould never obtain legislative sanction; but such sanction being\r\nimperatively demanded, the Epidemiological Society provided what\r\nwas thought requisite for Parliamentary conviction.\r\n\r\nIt is said that Vaccination was a medical question; but all\r\nquestions are transformed when they ascend to politics. The origin,\r\ncharacter, and action of varieties of animal virus are mysteries,\r\nand may remain mysteries with general indifference; but when it is\r\nclaimed that the inoculation of such virus prevents smallpox, and\r\nthat whoever refuses to submit his child to the said inoculation\r\nshall be fined 20s., then the matter is brought within the\r\npersonal jurisdiction of every citizen, and he becomes entitled to\r\ninformation, to the exercise of his judgment, and the expression\r\nof his opinion. As a mystery, vaccination belongs to experts;\r\nbut as a Parliamentary preventive of smallpox it is within the\r\ndiscrimination of all who can observe and appreciate the evidence\r\nof numbers. For a legislator like Lord Lyttelton to confess his\r\nignorance, and that he moved under the dictation of certain “able\r\nand learned persons,” was to abandon his proper function, and\r\nsurrender himself to imposture.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[281] _Memoirs._ By C.

The vaccinations under one year of age were\r\nmore than doubled; and nearly 300,000 children above one year old,\r\nto whom the law did not apply, were driven into the net, and “cut\r\nfor the pox” at the public expense. Thus the public vaccinations\r\nof 1854 exceeded the births of that year by 75,000. Subsequently\r\nthe rate fell off and fluctuated as appears from the following\r\ntable for England and Wales--\r\n\r\n                       Public\r\n    Years.  Births.  Vaccinations.\r\n    1853    601,223    376,218\r\n    1854    623,699    698,935\r\n    1855    623,181    464,099\r\n    1856    640,840    435,012\r\n    1857    649,963    423,421\r\n    1858    654,914    468,008\r\n    1859    669,834    455,349\r\n    1860    689,060    494,942\r\n\r\nYet this extension of practice did not satisfy the medical\r\nadventurers of the Epidemiological Society. They pointed out that\r\nuniversal vaccination was the desideratum, and these results fell\r\nshort of universality--\r\n\r\n  The Act of 1853 was intended to apply not to 65 per cent. of the\r\n  births, but to every child born. A certain deduction, it is true,\r\n  must be made for those privately vaccinated; and whilst there are\r\n  no data for exactly estimating the proportion of these (which\r\n  probably varies considerably in different parts of the Kingdom);\r\n  yet taking the country throughout, there is reason to believe\r\n  that not more than from 10 to 15 per cent. of the children\r\n  born are so vaccinated; for it is found that in unions where\r\n  particular care is bestowed upon public vaccination, the number\r\n  publicly operated on is from 85 to 90 per cent. of the births.\r\n  If we estimate 80 per cent. only, as the number requiring to be\r\n  provided for by public vaccination, the results of last year\r\n  [1854] fall short of those which should be attained by nearly\r\n  100,000.\r\n\r\nThis estimate is worth attention as sustaining a conclusion I\r\nhave repeatedly tried to enforce. Prior to 1840, vaccination was\r\na matter almost exclusively of private concern, extending to no\r\nmore than 10 or 15 per cent. of the population--or, let us allow,\r\n20 per cent.--and those chiefly the well fed, well clad, and well\r\nhoused. Yet the diminution of smallpox, dating from a period in\r\nlast century when variolous inoculation was in full practice and\r\ncowpox was unknown, is persistently ascribed to the introduction of\r\nvaccination which up to 1840 did not apply to more than one-fifth\r\nof the people; the four-fifths exempt from the prophylaxy being\r\nnotoriously the chief factors of the disease!\r\n\r\nParliament having so readily consented to the Compulsory Act of\r\n1853, it gave cause for acute chagrin that more had not been asked,\r\nwhen more might so easily have been had; and the operators behind\r\nthe Epidemiological Society set to work to try whether the lost\r\nopportunity might not be retrieved. In a Memorial addressed to\r\nthe President of the Board of Health in the name of the Society,\r\nin 1855,[285] we find a project developed which lacked nothing of\r\naudacity and comprehensiveness. First, the virtue of vaccination\r\nwas asserted in unqualified terms--\r\n\r\n  Smallpox is the most preventive of diseases, differing from all\r\n  other epidemic diseases in this remarkable respect, that while\r\n  these latter can only be prevented by discovering and remedying\r\n  the various conditions (as of crowding, want of drainage, filth,\r\n  and the like) which give rise to or assist in the dissemination\r\n  of the specific poison of each disease, the former may be\r\n  guarded against and prevented by a direct prophylactic measure.\r\n  To Smallpox, in short, there is an antidote. The same cannot\r\n  be affirmed, in the present state of knowledge, of any other\r\n  epidemic disease.\r\n\r\n  That antidote is Vaccination. In exact proportion as this has\r\n  been efficiently practised, have the extent and severity of\r\n  Smallpox been diminished over the surface of the world. To the\r\n  neglect of it, or to its inefficient performance, is due the\r\n  large existing mortality from the disease in this country.\r\n\r\nEvidently the advice, _Pecca fortiter_, had been laid to heart\r\nby the framer of the preceding declaration. Certainly the scheme\r\nfor which it stood as preamble required violent justification.\r\nIt was no less than the institution of a Vaccination Office with\r\ndespotic powers as a department of State. The appointment of public\r\nvaccinators subordinate to the Board of Guardians, subject to\r\ncontract, and paid out of the poor-rate, was held to be a degrading\r\nform of service: it prejudiced vaccination as a form of alms, and\r\nreduced medical men to the rank of parochial officers. Worst of\r\nall, the pay was bad--\r\n\r\n  The provisions for the remuneration of public vaccinators\r\n  have not been such as to secure their hearty and zealous\r\n  co-operation. The most injurious consequences have undoubtedly\r\n  resulted from this, both in limiting the numbers vaccinated,\r\n  and in discouraging the vaccinators from giving that pains and\r\n  attention to watch the progress of the Vaccine Disease which are\r\n  imperatively necessary.\r\n\r\nThey must, therefore, be emancipated. An independent organisation,\r\nwith a medical chief, was essential alike to the mystery and\r\ndignity of the craft, and the universal and efficient exercise of\r\nits functions. To save the country from smallpox, two conditions\r\nwere requisite--\r\n\r\n  First, that it be made a matter of legal obligation on all\r\n  persons resident within England and Wales, whether born within\r\n  that portion of the Kingdom or not, to give evidence of being\r\n  vaccinated.\r\n\r\n  Second, that to achieve this end, there be provided\r\n  administrative science, zeal, and activity.\r\n\r\n  The union of these conditions is indispensable; either without\r\n  the other will fail.\r\n\r\nIt was pointed out that the Act of 1853 only applied to children\r\nborn in England and Wales after a certain date--\r\n\r\n  It does not extend to the whole existing population, nor to\r\n  immigrants. It is well known that Smallpox is largely imported\r\n  into this country, and kept up from Ireland. These Irish not\r\n  only form a nidus for the disease in towns where they collect in\r\n  large numbers, but they disseminate it throughout the country at\r\n  harvest time, and in the season of hopping.\r\n\r\nTo fight and overcome smallpox, to meet and arrest epidemics, the\r\nlaw must be administered by qualified, zealous, and “adequately\r\nremunerated” officers; but “the keystone to any effective system”\r\nmust be a commander-in-chief--\r\n\r\n  No compulsory enactment, however comprehensive and stringent; no\r\n  alteration in the mode of appointing public vaccinators, however\r\n  desirable; no additional remuneration and encouragement to them,\r\n  however necessary, will be sufficient to secure the grand object\r\n  to be had in view, the Universal diffusion of Vaccination and\r\n  the Extinction of Smallpox, unless there be some competent and\r\n  energetic Medical Officer to harmonise the whole system and keep\r\n  it in constant activity; to examine continually its working, that\r\n  what is defective may be immediately supplied; and, in cases in\r\n  which it is required, to enforce the law, whether against those\r\n  who refuse to submit themselves to Vaccination, or against those\r\n  who, by travelling about, diffuse Smallpox throughout the Kingdom.\r\n\r\nIt was further said, “The changes thus proposed _have long\r\nbeen looked forward to_ by the president and council of the\r\nEpidemiological Society as essential to a proper system of public\r\nvaccination”--of which, indeed, there was no doubt; for to effect\r\nthe said changes was the chief end of the Society and of its ruling\r\nspirit, Dr. Edward C. Seaton. Though it may seem incredible,\r\nit will not surprise any who have studied the habit of the\r\nthorough-bred quack, that the designated commander-in-chief, “the\r\nkeystone of the system,” the miraculous combination of scientific\r\nand administrative ability, was none other than the projector, Dr.\r\nSeaton himself! He it was who in fancy saw himself the elected head\r\nof the New Vaccination Office, with place and pay at his disposal,\r\nand power to examine and vaccinate every resident upon English soil.\r\n\r\nThe Memorial concluded with the opinion that in view of “the\r\ncontinued high rate of mortality from smallpox,” some measure\r\nshould be concerted “for carrying out the alterations suggested\r\nduring the present (1855) session of Parliament.”\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying that the project developed in the Memorial\r\nwas an impracticability; and that it should have been “long looked\r\nforward to by the president and council of the Epidemiological\r\nSociety” proves what manner of dreamers they were. The mortality\r\nfrom smallpox in England and Wales constituted, they said, 2\r\nper cent. of the national mortality; but not even the reduction\r\nof the 2 per cent. could have reconciled the people to the New\r\nVaccination Office with its ruling spirit, its expenditure, and its\r\ninquisitors. Bad as smallpox may be, there is worse than smallpox;\r\nand much worse would have been Dr. Seaton with his pernicious\r\nquackery and his intrusive myrmidons. The recrudescence of similar\r\nprojects from time to time attests the existence of visionaries\r\nwho not only misunderstand the temper and traditions of their\r\ncountrymen, but the constitution of human nature itself.\r\n\r\nThe year 1855 was one of war and excitement, but a bill drawn on\r\nthe lines of the Memorial was introduced to the House of Commons\r\nproviding that from the 1st of January, 1856, the vaccination of\r\nthe people should be committed to a medical superintendent with a\r\nmedical staff, drawing their salaries from the Treasury, who would\r\ntake over the existing local administration from the Poor Law\r\nauthorities, and organise and develop it afresh. Further, it was\r\nprovided--\r\n\r\n  That every adult person resident in England and Wales on 1st\r\n  January, 1856, who had not already been successfully vaccinated,\r\n  nor had Smallpox, be vaccinated by a duly qualified practitioner,\r\n  or by a public vaccinator, within three months of that date, and\r\n  submit to an inspection by the medical man, or public vaccinator,\r\n  eight days after vaccination, under a penalty of £1.\r\n\r\n  That adults not born in England and Wales, and coming to reside\r\n  therein, be vaccinated (if not already vaccinated) within three\r\n  months of their arrival, under a penalty of £1.\r\n\r\n  That children be taken by their parents to be vaccinated within\r\n  three months after 1st January, 1856, and be inspected eight days\r\n  after vaccination, under a penalty of £1.\r\n\r\n  That children brought to England and Wales from other parts be\r\n  vaccinated in like manner within three months of their arrival.\r\n\r\n  That children and adults be revaccinated until the operation is\r\n  declared successful. If after repeated vaccinations, a patient\r\n  prove insusceptible, a certificate to that effect shall protect\r\n  him from the penalty otherwise rigidly inflicted.\r\n\r\n  That Public Vaccinators be entitled to a fee of 2s. 6d. for every\r\n  child or adult successfully vaccinated within two miles of the\r\n  Vaccinator’s residence, and 3s. 6d. if beyond that limit. That\r\n  Medical Practitioners, not public vaccinators, be entitled to 1s.\r\n  for every person entered by them on the register as vaccinated.\r\n\r\n  That a certificate of successful vaccination be granted for the\r\n  trifling fee of 6d.\r\n\r\n  That the Superintendent be empowered to institute rigid inquiry\r\n  and to prosecute for penalties wherever he suspects the\r\n  regulations of the Act have been neglected or violated.\r\n\r\nHere, indeed, was a dose of despotism for Englishmen! Nothing being\r\ndone in 1855, there was time for reconsideration. It was felt that\r\nthe withdrawal of vaccination from local administration was too\r\nrevolutionary; and another bill was introduced in 1856, under the\r\ndirection of Mr. W. F. Cowper, President of the Board of Health\r\n(dropping the New Vaccination Office), with provisions for the\r\ninspection and vaccination of children in public schools, and of\r\nemigrants; for revaccination in the event of epidemics; and for\r\ncoroners’ inquests on unvaccinated children dying of smallpox.\r\nThere was no popular demand for such legislation. It was promoted\r\nby a group of medical place-hunters operating under the mask of the\r\nEpidemiological Society. The solitary petition in its favour was\r\npresented, 26th May, 1856, by Mr. James Furness Marson, a comrade\r\nof Dr. Seaton in the direction of the Society. Marson was resident\r\nsurgeon of the Smallpox Hospital at Highgate, and as evidence of\r\nhis unscrupulous advocacy, we may take the following assertions--\r\n\r\n  Your Petitioner has, in the course of twenty years, vaccinated\r\n  upwards of 40,000 persons, and has never seen any evil results\r\n  traceable to Vaccination, with the exception of a single instance\r\n  in which measles occurred at the same time, and four or five\r\n  examples of rather severely sore arms arising from lymph recently\r\n  taken from the cow. He has never seen other diseases communicated\r\n  from the Vaccine Disease, nor does he believe in the popular\r\n  reports that they are ever so communicated.\r\n\r\n  The mortality from Smallpox in the Unvaccinated, of cases taken\r\n  generally, is 35 per cent.; and among the Vaccinated attacked by\r\n  Smallpox it is 7 per cent.\r\n\r\n  Among children under fourteen years of age who have been\r\n  vaccinated, Smallpox hardly ever proves fatal.\r\n\r\n  As an example of what can be done by efficient Vaccination, your\r\n  Petitioner begs to state that not one of the servants or nurses\r\n  of the Smallpox Hospital has had Smallpox for the last twenty\r\n  years. They have all been either vaccinated or revaccinated on\r\n  coming to live at the Hospital.\r\n\r\nThe Petitioner omitted to mention how many of the said servants\r\nand nurses had entered the Hospital as patients, and were pleased\r\nto remain as officials. Prevarication throughout was the note\r\nof Marson’s petition: he might argue that what he stated was\r\ntrue--true under conditions and reserves unstated.\r\n\r\nIt is often observed that the crafty never operate so successfully\r\nas when they have the earnest and ingenuous for instruments; and in\r\nMr. Cowper, President of the Board of Health, the wire-pullers of\r\nthe Epidemiological Society had just such a tool. He believed what\r\nhe was told, and delivered it with his own sincerity. In moving the\r\nsecond reading of the Bill on 31st March, he represented its object\r\nas “nothing more than the consolidation and amendment of preceding\r\nActs;” and went on to say--\r\n\r\n  It is admitted by every medical man whose opinion is worth a\r\n  moment’s consideration, that Vaccination is a specific against\r\n  Smallpox; of course I mean where the operation is properly\r\n  performed. In fact, it is a point decided in the medical world\r\n  that Vaccination, when properly performed, is a guarantee against\r\n  Smallpox, except in extremely rare cases; and no evidence has\r\n  been produced to justify the idea that it is attended with\r\n  injurious consequences. Statistics show that in proportion\r\n  as Vaccination is extended, the mortality from Smallpox is\r\n  diminished.\r\n\r\nAnd so on; the lesson being recited with all the docility of a good\r\nchild. Mr. Henley struck a different note--\r\n\r\n  There is considerable dissatisfaction throughout the country\r\n  with the mode in which Vaccination is performed. In my own\r\n  neighbourhood, for example, the poor people complain that all\r\n  sorts of eruptions appear on their children after the Vaccination\r\n  they are compelled to undergo; and though they may be quite\r\n  wrong, you cannot persuade them to the contrary. Then, too, I\r\n  cannot approve of the transfer of Vaccination from the Guardians\r\n  to a Central Medical Board. That change must be removed from the\r\n  bill.\r\n\r\nThe second reading having passed unopposed on 31st March, and\r\nnothing more being heard of the bill, Mr. T. Duncombe, who knew\r\nthe ropes of the parliamentary ship, grew suspicious, and on 7th\r\nJuly asked Mr. Cowper if he could fix a time when the bill would be\r\nbrought on. Suspicion was amply justified by Mr. Cowper’s answer.\r\nHe said--\r\n\r\n  The bill is not one in which Members take any great interest. It\r\n  is one of that class of bills which are usually taken at a late\r\n  period of the evening; and I hope the Hon. Member will not object\r\n  to its being taken at the same time as other bills of similar\r\n  character.\r\n\r\nTo which Mr. Duncombe replied--\r\n\r\n  If Hon. Members do not care for the bill, they do great\r\n  injustice to the people, because it is a compulsory bill. Two\r\n  hundred petitions have been presented against it, and only one in\r\n  its favour. A more arrant job than this bill I never knew, and I\r\n  hope an opportunity may be given me to oppose it.\r\n\r\nMr. Cowper’s simplicity was apparent in his answer. He said--\r\n\r\n  I do not mean that the bill is of no importance, for it is\r\n  intended to check the ravages of a disease which kills thousands\r\n  every year. What I intended was, that the opposition which my\r\n  Hon. Friend offers is not shared by other Members. My Hon. Friend\r\n  says the bill will make Vaccination compulsory; but Vaccination\r\n  is compulsory already. The purpose of the bill is to consolidate\r\n  and improve existing legislation. It would be much fairer if my\r\n  Hon. Friend brought in a bill to repeal compulsion. I will not\r\n  bring in the bill after 12 o’clock at night.\r\n\r\nThe pledge not to bring on the bill after midnight settled its\r\nfate. Its promoters, aware that its provisions would not hear\r\ndiscussion, had reckoned on its unopposed passage at an hour when\r\nmembers were few, weary, and indifferent. Mr. Duncombe’s vigilance\r\ndefeated the scheme, which Mr. Cowper incontinently revealed. The\r\nbill was brought into Committee on 10th July, and the order for its\r\nreading discharged amid general satisfaction. Mr. Henley observed--\r\n\r\n  I am very glad this bill is withdrawn. The endeavour to make\r\n  Vaccination compulsory has been most mischievous. Vaccination was\r\n  quietly making its way. People were adopting it more and more;\r\n  but from the moment it was made compulsory, they began to think\r\n  every evil which happened to their children afterwards ensued\r\n  from it. I have no objection to refer the question to a Select\r\n  Committee as suggested, but whatever their report, nothing will\r\n  satisfy me that it is advisable to make Vaccination compulsory.\r\n\r\nMr. Duncombe agreed that the course proposed was judicious--\r\n\r\n  The question is delicate and difficult, and investigation should\r\n  precede legislation. In 1853, at a later period of the session\r\n  than that at which we have arrived, the Compulsory Vaccination\r\n  Act was smuggled through the House. Fortunately it became\r\n  inoperative through its own defects, which it is now proposed to\r\n  remove, and to make the law more stringent; but while I believe\r\n  that great good has resulted from Vaccination, I do not think we\r\n  should try to encourage it by penal enactment.\r\n\r\nMr. Cowper, in protesting against surrender, observed--\r\n\r\n  Some argue as if people should never be forced to do what they\r\n  do not like; but the force of this objection is greatly weakened\r\n  when we recollect that in compelling Vaccination we are not\r\n  obliging parents to do anything disadvantageous to themselves,\r\n  but merely to take precautions against a loathsome and terrible\r\n  disease.\r\n\r\nThe most intolerable tyrannies vindicate themselves by the\r\nadvantages they enforce on their perverse subjects. The claim made\r\nfor vaccination, that it protects the vaccinated from smallpox,\r\ndeprived the vaccinated of any right to complain of risk of injury\r\nfrom the unvaccinated. Moreover, that those who were persuaded\r\nthat vaccination neither prevented nor mitigated smallpox should\r\nbe required to undergo an operation, that was to them a cruel and\r\ndangerous imposture, was surely a wrong of the most excruciating\r\ncharacter. It was well that neither the bill of 1855 or 1856 was\r\nallowed to pass; but if either had passed, it might have brought\r\nthe question of compulsion to an earlier issue.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[285] _Memorial presented to the President of the Board of Health,\r\nby the President and Council of the Epidemiological Society, on\r\na proper State Provision for the Prevention of Smallpox and the\r\nExtension of Vaccination._ Ordered to be printed by the House of\r\nCommons, 1st March, 1855.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\nJOHN GIBBS’S LETTER--1855.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we have said, there was little living confidence in vaccination.\r\nJenner’s undertaking, “that the person inoculated with cowpox is\r\nrendered perfectly secure from the infection of smallpox,” had\r\nbeen everywhere conspicuously belied. But latterly a new faith\r\nhad come into existence as to the preventibility of disease and\r\nthe possibility of its suppression; and, thus persuaded, the\r\npublic were less disposed to be sceptical toward new or revived\r\nprophylactic impostures. Favoured by this disposition of the\r\npublic mind, a clique of vaccinators, operating under cover of the\r\nEpidemiological Society, were able to obtain concessions from\r\nParliament which, prior to the sanitary evangel, were unattainable.\r\nIt was only when too audacious, they proposed to set up a\r\nVaccination Office, endowed from the Exchequer, with inquisitorial\r\nand punitive functions, that they suffered check.\r\n\r\nTo resist doctrine it is necessary to possess doctrine. People\r\nmight distrust or dislike vaccination, but they were at a great\r\ndisadvantage against aggressors until prepared to justify their\r\ndistrust and dislike in definite and scientific form, setting\r\nevidence against assertion, and veracious against factitious\r\nstatistics. Unfortunately the mischief of coercive legislation\r\nwas consummated ere opposition was organised. The first to frame\r\na comprehensive indictment against vaccination was John Gibbs, an\r\nIrish gentleman. It took the form of a letter addressed to Sir\r\nBenjamin Hall, dated from Maze Hill Cottage, St. Leonards-on-Sea,\r\n30th June, 1855. On the motion of Joseph Brotherton, M.P. for\r\nSalford, the letter was ordered to be printed by the House of\r\nCommons, 31st March, 1856.[286]\r\n\r\nMr. Gibbs opened his letter with drawing attention to the fact\r\nthat whilst the Compulsory Act of 1853 was the first direct attack\r\nupon personal liberty in medical matters, there was “no subject\r\nupon which so many otherwise well-informed persons betrayed such\r\nignorance and credulity as upon vaccination.” Indeed, upon nothing\r\nwere the legislators who enacted compulsion so frank as in their\r\nconfession of ignorance and submission to medical instruction. What\r\nwas there to justify legislation on terms thus abject against their\r\nfellow-countrymen?--\r\n\r\n  Why is Vaccination held in abhorrence by so many? Have those who\r\n  reject it no weighty reasons to justify their rejection? They do\r\n  not believe that it affords an efficient and assured protection\r\n  against the invasion of Smallpox; they have a natural disgust\r\n  to the transfer of a loathsome virus from a diseased brute,\r\n  through they know not how many unhealthy human mediums, to the\r\n  veins of their children; they have a dread, a conviction, that\r\n  other filthy diseases, tending to embitter and shorten life, are\r\n  frequently transmitted through the vaccine virus; they cannot\r\n  bring themselves to believe that the true way to health can be to\r\n  corrupt the blood and lower the vital energies by the infusion\r\n  of a poison and its consequent train of morbid influences; and\r\n  further, they have a conscientious conviction that voluntarily to\r\n  propagate disease is to set at naught the Divine Providence and\r\n  violate the Divine Will.\r\n\r\n  Are such scruples and objections entitled to no respect? Should\r\n  they be permitted to have no force? Are they capable of no\r\n  justification? Should the sole answer to them be a Coercion\r\n  Act? Such is not the best way to disarm hostility, and to\r\n  ensure conviction. Who would put faith in the professions of a\r\n  philanthropist who should threaten the objects of his beneficence\r\n  with fine or imprisonment if they did not accept his proffered\r\n  boon? Or who could receive with cordiality and respect the doctor\r\n  of physic who should thunder at the door, armed with scab and\r\n  lancet, threatening to assault the inmates if they did not accept\r\n  his services? If Vaccination be indeed a blessing which must\r\n  needs be showered upon the land, would it not be more becoming in\r\n  a wise Government and a free people to trust to the dissemination\r\n  of information rather than attempt to make unconverted converts\r\n  by force?\r\n\r\nHad smallpox been preventible by vaccination, such contention\r\nwould have been useless. The virtue of the rite, manifest in\r\nits efficacy, would have secured its observance. The bitterness\r\nof compulsion lay in the attempt to enforce imposture, and to\r\nsuppress the convictions of those whose perceptions were sharper,\r\nand whose loyalty to right was more determined than in the mass of\r\nthe nation. Mr. Gibbs had no difficulty in adducing evidence in\r\nproof that vaccination did not prevent smallpox. The reports of the\r\nRegistrar-General and the hospitals furnished testimony in such\r\nprofusion, that his difficulty lay in the selection of examples\r\nlikely to be most convincing. From the _Lancet_, of 21st May, 1853,\r\nhe took the following confession--\r\n\r\n  In the public mind extensively, and to a more limited extent in\r\n  the medical profession itself, doubts are known to exist as to\r\n  the efficacy and eligibility of Vaccination. The failures of the\r\n  operation have been numerous and discouraging.\r\n\r\nNor did the failure to prevent smallpox exhaust the condemnation\r\nof vaccination. Ineffective, it was far from harmless. Itself a\r\ndisease, it was a conductor and excitant of other diseases, and,\r\ninoculated, occasionally bore with it other company. Erysipelas,\r\nas Jenner taught, was the note of successful vaccination; but\r\nerysipelas, not being a limitable affection, was frequently a\r\nmortal one; and deaths from erysipelas as a sequence of vaccination\r\nwere of constant occurrence. Then there were skin eruptions,\r\ncarbuncular and glandular swellings, tuberculosis, scrofula,\r\nsyphilis, etc., either provoked or inseminated with the vaccine\r\ndisease. Such results were so distinctly recognised that, in the\r\n_Lancet_, of the 11th November, 1854, it was stated--\r\n\r\n  So widely extended is the dread that along with the prophylaxy\r\n  something else may be inoculated, that few medical practitioners\r\n  would care to vaccinate their own children from a source of the\r\n  purity of which they are not well assured.\r\n\r\nBut the care vaccinators exercised over their own offspring was\r\nimpracticable for the multitude. Again, citing the _Lancet_, 23rd\r\nOctober, 1854, it was said--\r\n\r\n  The poor are told that they must carry their children to be\r\n  vaccinated by medical men who may be strangers to them. They\r\n  apprehend--and the apprehension is not altogether unfounded,\r\n  or unshared by the educated classes, that the vaccine matter\r\n  employed may carry with it the seeds of other diseases not less\r\n  loathsome than the one it is intended to prevent.\r\n\r\nUseless against smallpox, and injurious in itself, it remained to\r\ntest the influence of vaccination on the health of the community--\r\n\r\n  What is the per centage of deaths from all epidemics among the\r\n  Vaccinated as compared with the Unvaccinated? What is the per\r\n  centage respectively of cases of disease of the respiratory\r\n  organs, of skin diseases, of scrofula, and of convulsions? What\r\n  is the average duration of life among the Vaccinated and among\r\n  the Unvaccinated? Of a thousand children vaccinated within a\r\n  given time after birth, and of a thousand unvaccinated, the\r\n  whole two thousand being placed as nearly as possible in like\r\n  circumstances, what per centage in each thousand attain the age\r\n  of puberty?\r\n\r\n  These are statistics with which the advocates of Vaccination have\r\n  never grappled. Is it not, then, rather premature to decide that\r\n  Vaccination is an unmixed good, a boon which we ought not only\r\n  gratefully to accept, but which we should even combine to force\r\n  upon the acceptance of others?\r\n\r\n  If it should appear that before a given age the rate of mortality\r\n  from all causes be the same among a thousand vaccinated and a\r\n  thousand unvaccinated children, of what avail is Vaccination?\r\n  Of what import is it, as a public question, in what shape death\r\n  claims his allotted number of victims, whether by Smallpox,\r\n  Scarlet Fever, or Hooping Cough? If, however, the rate of\r\n  mortality should prove to be greater among the Vaccinated than\r\n  among the Unvaccinated, how shall we avoid the conclusion that\r\n  Vaccination is a curse and not a blessing?\r\n\r\nThe interdependence of the forms of zymotic disease, so luminously\r\ndisplayed by Dr. Watt in the statistics of Glasgow, was apparently\r\na conception in excess of the capacity of the average medical mind.\r\nIt was the custom of vaccinators to treat smallpox as a solitary\r\nexistence, any diminution of which was ascribed to the observance\r\nof their rite, and any increase to its neglect, although the\r\nobservance of the rite was neither less in the waxing, nor more in\r\nthe waning of the disease. With many illustrations from medical\r\nliterature, Mr. Gibbs enforced the lesson that diseases were\r\nnot irregular and detached disasters, but varied manifestations\r\nof a common disorder: that when one form prevailed, other forms\r\nabated or disappeared; that health, and the defect of health, were\r\nreferable to habits and conditions of life; and that the consequent\r\nrate of mortality was unaffected whether smallpox happened to be\r\none of its factors--indeed, in numerous instances, a reduced rate\r\nof mortality signalised the prevalence of smallpox. In short,\r\nto suppose that the creation and culture of an ailment like\r\nvaccination could by any means tend to the invigoration of life was\r\nto reverse the canon--that health always and everywhere was the\r\nbest defence of health.\r\n\r\nAmong the supporters of his thesis, none had greater weight than\r\nDr. George Gregory. Adducing “the experience which twenty years of\r\nofficial connection with the Smallpox and Vaccination Hospital had\r\ngiven him,” he asserted--\r\n\r\n  The great principle that there are no diseases strictly isolated\r\n  from others. They are links in a chain--\r\n\r\n      “All are but parts of one stupendous whole.”\r\n\r\n  They must be viewed in conjunction, if we would hope to form\r\n  just, enlarged, and legitimate views of the character and\r\n  pathological affinities of each.\r\n\r\nLong surmised, but never proved, until the statistical inquiries of\r\nrecent times showed its correctness, Dr. Gregory continues--\r\n\r\n  We may, for want of a better name, call this curious doctrine the\r\n  Law of Vicarious Mortality; by which is understood that whenever\r\n  one epidemic diminishes, another increases, so that the sum total\r\n  of epidemic mortality remains, on an average of years, nearly the\r\n  same.\r\n\r\n  EPIDEMIC MORTALITY IN ENGLAND AND WALES DURING 1838, 1839, AND\r\n  1840.\r\n\r\n    +------------------------------+----------+----------+----------+\r\n    |                              |Year 1838.|Year 1839.|Year 1840.|\r\n    +------------------------------+----------+----------+----------+\r\n    |Smallpox                      |   16,268 |    9,131 |   10,434 |\r\n    |Measles                       |    6,514 |   10,937 |    9,326 |\r\n    |Scarlet Fever                 |    5,802 |   10,325 |   19,816 |\r\n    |                              +----------+----------+----------|\r\n    |  Total Mortality by the      |   28,584 |   30,393 |   39,576 |\r\n    |      Exanthemata,            |          |          |          |\r\n    |Hooping Cough                 |    9,107 |    8,165 |    6,132 |\r\n    |                              +----------+----------+----------+\r\n    |  Total Epidemic Mortality    |   37,691 |   38,558 |   45,708 |\r\n    |                              +----------+----------+----------+\r\n    |  Total Mortality throughout  |          |          |          |\r\n    |    Englandand Wales          |  342,529 |  338,979 |  359,561 |\r\n    +------------------------------+----------+----------+----------+\r\n\r\n  We learn from this table, that every year is distinguished by\r\n  some master epidemic. In 1838, Smallpox was the ruling epidemic\r\n  throughout England. In 1839, Measles and Scarlet Fever struggled\r\n  for the mastery. In 1840, Scarlet Fever was so general and so\r\n  fatal, that the mortality by it exceeded by one-fifth the ravages\r\n  of Smallpox during the epidemic season of 1838, and more than\r\n  doubled the mortality by that disease in 1839....\r\n\r\n  Everything teaches us that when one avenue to death is closed\r\n  another opens--\r\n\r\n      “Noctes atque dies patet atri janua Ditis.”\r\n\r\n  Vaccination, great as its merits are [What are they?--J. G.],\r\n  and no one more fully appreciates them than I do, does not, and\r\n  cannot do, all that its too sanguine admirers promised. The\r\n  blessings of Vaccination are met and balanced by the Law of\r\n  Vicarious Mortality. How and why is this? The explanation is\r\n  easy. The weak plants of a nursery must be weeded out. If weakly\r\n  children do not fall victims to Smallpox, they live to fall into\r\n  the jaws of tyrants scarcely less inexorable. Scarlet Fever and\r\n  Measles are both advancing in respect of mortality; and the\r\n  increase of deaths by Hooping Cough since this century set in\r\n  [that is, since the introduction of Vaccination.--J. G.] is quite\r\n  extraordinary.[287]\r\n\r\nThe concession of so much was the concession of all. If smallpox\r\nwas merely displaced to be replaced, and the tale of death\r\nmaintained by cognate diseases, what was there to claim for\r\nvaccination, even if it were allowed to have an influence adverse\r\nto smallpox? Where were the lives saved? and where the glory of the\r\nimmortal Jenner?\r\n\r\nThe advocates of compulsory vaccination were accustomed to cite\r\ncountries like Austria, where the practice was enforced, for\r\nEnglish imitation. Let us then compare, said Mr. Gibbs, the\r\ndeath-rate of the chief centres of English population with the\r\ndeath-rate of the chief divisions of Austria, and note which had\r\nthe advantage in the years 1850-51--\r\n\r\n                        Death-rate\r\n                         per 1000.\r\n\r\n    England and Wales      22·0\r\n    London                 23·3\r\n    Liverpool              29·0\r\n    Manchester             29·0\r\n    Birmingham             23·3\r\n    Leeds                  24·6\r\n    Dublin                 26·8\r\n    Cork                   23·3\r\n    Lower Austria          35·7\r\n    Upper Austria          27·7\r\n    Styria                 30·3\r\n    Bohemia                38·6\r\n    Moravia                30·9\r\n    Galicia                30·8\r\n    Lombardy               33·9\r\n    Venetia                33·3\r\n\r\nThese figures required no commentary. If vaccination had stopped\r\nsmallpox in Austria, it evidently had not reduced mortality even\r\nto the level of the most insanitary English towns.\r\n\r\nAssuming, said Mr. Gibbs, that vaccination is entitled to all the\r\ncredit claimed for it, let us endeavour to estimate the gain, if it\r\nshould be enforced. The yearly average of deaths from all causes,\r\nin England and Wales, is 370,000, of which about 7,000 are from\r\nsmallpox--\r\n\r\n  This 7,000, then, is the limit of gain which enforced Vaccination\r\n  could confer; but from the 7,000 should be deducted about\r\n  one-third for deaths from Smallpox among the Vaccinated; and from\r\n  the remainder should be deducted an equivalent for the deaths\r\n  caused immediately and remotely by Vaccination; and another\r\n  equivalent for the deaths resulting from the Law of Vicarious\r\n  Mortality. This done, it would require no little ingenuity to\r\n  discover a balance in favour of Vaccination.\r\n\r\nHaving thus argued the matter out, was not Mr. Gibbs justified in\r\nasking--\r\n\r\n  What would be thought of the tinker who would knock a hole in the\r\n  bottom of his saucepan lest one should be burned there in the\r\n  ordinary way?\r\n\r\n  Yet it is just what the vaccinator does; and when he finds--as he\r\n  might have foreseen, had he been governed by common sense--that\r\n  his saucepan does not wear a bit the better, but rather the\r\n  worse, he gravely endeavours to excuse the failure, by asserting\r\n  that unfortunately he made the hole too big, or too little, too\r\n  much on this side, or too much on that, or by offering some other\r\n  equally wise excuse.\r\n\r\nLastly, there were the political and moral considerations involved\r\nin compulsory vaccination--the first attempt in England to confer\r\non a medical prescription the force of law--\r\n\r\n  Surely, a wise Government may perceive that there are greater\r\n  evils than the occasional outbreak of an epidemic. The systematic\r\n  violation of human rights and natural affections, the uprooting\r\n  from the human breast of feelings of self-reliance, a state\r\n  religion in physic, coercion which may well be regarded as odious\r\n  persecution, the belief of the poor that what they hold dearest\r\n  is sacrificed to the selfish prejudices of the rich--any one of\r\n  these is far worse than a pestilence.\r\n\r\n  Cannot they who believe in Vaccination protect themselves? Nobody\r\n  seeks to hinder them; nobody presumes to dispute their right to\r\n  adopt any medical practice, however questionable it may be.\r\n  Why cannot they act with like forbearance to others? Surely, if\r\n  freedom be more than a name, it implies the right of the freeman\r\n  to reject not only that which other men may choose to regard as\r\n  evil, but even that which they may combine to urge upon him as\r\n  good....\r\n\r\n  How absurd that an attempt should be made to visit with\r\n  punishment the want of belief in a scientific, or rather\r\n  unscientific, dogma! How absurd to pretend to the possession of a\r\n  prophylactic of such unquestionable potency that its acceptance\r\n  requires the threat of force! In their anxiety to coerce others,\r\n  compulsory vaccinators demonstrate their own defect of faith in\r\n  the prescription which they assert affords complete security from\r\n  Smallpox.\r\n\r\nAs observed, the service of Mr. Gibbs is entitled to special\r\ncommemoration, because it was the first attempt to put the\r\narguments against vaccination into systematic shape. He\r\ndemonstrated the quackery of the practice, and the fallacies\r\nwherewith it was defended; and denounced the tyranny of the\r\nlegislation that would compel those who recognised the imposture to\r\nsubmit to it. The service thus rendered by Mr. Gibbs constituted a\r\nground of vantage for further operations: those who had to contend\r\nagainst the delusion had their hands strengthened, and their power\r\nof assault magnified, by what he was favoured to accomplish.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOHN GIBBS was born at Enniscorthy, County Wexford, on 25th May,\r\n1811. Owing to the unsettled life of his father as Captain of the\r\nRoyal Cork Volunteers, his education was desultory--at various\r\nschools, and under various masters. Sagacious, bright, earnest, and\r\nindependent, he early manifested a passion for such things as made\r\nfor human welfare, and improvement. Abstinence from alcohol, in\r\nconnection with Father Mathew’s mission, had in him an enthusiastic\r\nadvocate. A book by Captain Claridge on the water cure excited his\r\ninterest, and led to the formation of the Enniscorthy Hydropathic\r\nSociety. Anxious to master the mysteries of this new treatment of\r\ndisease, he set out for Silesia in 1843, and placed himself under\r\nthe instruction of Priessnitz, remaining with him as a chosen\r\ndisciple until 1847, when he left with a certificate of competency.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (John Gibbs, with his signature)]\r\n\r\nWhilst acquiring his art with Priessnitz, he communicated his\r\nexperiences to his Enniscorthy friends, who published them in\r\nthe Wexford newspapers, a selection from which was reproduced as\r\n_Letters from Grœfenberg_, in 1847. A passage in one of these\r\nletters, dated 27th November, 1844, indicates the manner in which\r\nhis attention was drawn to smallpox--\r\n\r\n  Another case of Smallpox has just been treated by Priessnitz. The\r\n  patient is the daughter of a peasant in the neighbourhood, and is\r\n  about twenty years old. She was confined for eight days, and was\r\n  most profusely covered with the eruption. An Italian physician\r\n  said that he never saw the symptoms come out better. She had at\r\n  first the usual treatment--wet sheets, wet rubbings, and tepid\r\n  baths; and, after the eruption appeared, three wet sheets and\r\n  three tepid baths daily. She will not have the slightest mark.\r\n  Under the water cure Smallpox appears to be deprived of half its\r\n  terrors; as far as my observation extends, it neither robs man of\r\n  life, nor women of beauty.\r\n\r\nOn his return, he assisted Dr. Lovell in opening a hydropathic\r\nestablishment at Barking, Essex; and, in 1848, he undertook the\r\nmedical superintendence of the Grande Chartreuse in Piedmont.\r\nThere he met Miss Anna Skelton, to whom he was married, at Nice,\r\nin 1849. Ultimately he made his home at St. Leonards, Sussex. The\r\npassage of the Compulsory Vaccination Act, in 1853, led him to\r\npublish a pamphlet, _Our Medical Liberties_, 1854, which excited\r\nthe attention and won the approval of many thoughtful people. At\r\nthe suggestion of Mr. Thomas Baker, he constructed a letter from\r\nthe substance of the pamphlet, and addressed it to the President\r\nof the Board of Health, which, as we have seen, was issued as a\r\nparliamentary paper. The more vehement controversy which sprang up\r\nin recent years when the Vaccination Act was tightened, found Mr.\r\nGibbs in health too feeble for active exertion. After his wife’s\r\ndeath, he retired to Jersey to be near his sister, Mrs. General\r\nLane, in whose house he died in the winter of 1875.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[286] COMPULSORY VACCINATION.--Copy of a Letter, dated 30th\r\nJune, 1855, addressed to the President of the Board of Health by\r\nJOHN GIBBS, Esquire, entitled, _Compulsory Vaccination briefly\r\nconsidered in its Scientific, Religious, and Political Aspects._\r\nOrdered by the House of Commons to be printed, 31st March,\r\n1856.--Folio, pp. 31.\r\n\r\n[287] _Eruptive Fevers_, pp. 5-8. London, 1843.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\n\r\nSIMON’S DEFENCE AND HAMERNIK’S JUDGMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn attack on Vaccination like that delivered by John Gibbs had\r\nto be met, and Mr. John Simon, Medical Officer to the Board of\r\nHealth, was selected for the purpose. The answer appeared in\r\n1857 in a quarto blue-book entitled _Papers relating to the\r\nHistory and Practice of Vaccination_,[288] 83 pages consisting\r\nof a defence of Vaccination, and 188 pages of illustrative and\r\ncorroborative documents. Oddly enough the treatise of Mr. Gibb is\r\nnever once mentioned, whilst the order of defence is obviously\r\nmarshalled in front of his positions. The reason for this reserve\r\nwas double: first, it was considered unadvisable to magnify or\r\nadvertise so dangerous an antagonist; and second, it is considered\r\nunprofessional to discuss a medical question with one who is not in\r\nmedical orders.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing Mr. Simon’s defence we are constantly reminded of\r\nMill’s observation, that a doctrine is never truly judged until\r\nit is judged in its best form; and of Coleridge’s caution, that\r\nan adversary’s bad arguments are no evidence of the goodness of\r\nour own. It lay in the nature of things that many absurd and\r\ntrumpery objections should be advanced against vaccination, but\r\nto cite and sneer at them was neither to appreciate nor to refute\r\nthe objections that were valid. Had Simon been less scornful and\r\nless loftily disposed, condescending to deal with his antagonist\r\nverbatim, he might have proved no more successful, but he would\r\nhave had at least the praise of judicial intention.\r\n\r\nAfter the custom of the eulogists of vaccination, Mr. Simon opened\r\nwith a chapter on “Smallpox before the Discovery of Vaccination,”\r\nconsisting of terrible tales of the ravages of the disease among\r\nMexicans, Indians, Greenlanders, Icelanders, Siberians, Hottentots,\r\netc., as if disbelievers in vaccination were under any obligation\r\nto dispute them. It is not denied that smallpox may be a deadly\r\nepidemic: the contention is that vaccination would not abate its\r\ndeadliness. At the same time, when terrible tales are told of\r\nthe devastations of smallpox, it is but fair to press for proofs\r\nof their authenticity. Travellers and historians occasionally\r\nprefer the excitement of wonder to adherence to matter-of-fact.\r\nWhen, for instance, Mr. Simon gravely relates that “in Mexico 3½\r\nmillions were suddenly smitten down, leaving none to bury them,”\r\nit is permissible to inquire who was responsible for the Mexican\r\ncensus in the days of Cortez, and who counted the unburied dead?\r\nFurther, it is idle to attach importance to isolated statements\r\nabout smallpox, as if smallpox were an independent destroyer of\r\nmankind. It is a member of a group of destroyers, and its activity\r\nis usually coincident with a correspondent dormancy among its\r\nassociates. Until the complete vital statistics of a community are\r\nin evidence, it is vain to assert whom smallpox present has slain,\r\nor absent has saved. It is the prevalence of death, and not the\r\nmode of death, that is the critical question.\r\n\r\nAgain, when the familiar list of great folk who died of smallpox\r\nin Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries is run over, the remark\r\noccurs, that considering the habits and habitations of the said\r\ngreat folk, their fate was in nowise surprising. Those who believe\r\nthat smallpox is generated in unwholesome conditions of life are\r\nnot to be confounded by facts that illustrate their contention.\r\nAnd the like is to be said of the equally familiar tale of London\r\nsmallpox. It was to be expected that citizens housed and fed\r\nas Londoners were housed and fed should have been plagued with\r\nsmallpox and its congeners. What is denied is that vaccination\r\ncould have saved them from smallpox, or reduced their death-rate,\r\ntheir conditions of life remaining the same.\r\n\r\nThe extravagant exhibition of the horrors of smallpox is the\r\ncustomary preliminary to the presentation of Jenner as the saviour\r\nfrom them; and the part of showman in this respect was fulfilled\r\nwith more than ordinary abandon by Simon, who thus depicted the\r\nsituation and the rescue--\r\n\r\n  Medicine baffled and helpless! For millions of our race in after\r\n  times the continued raging of that pitiless plague! A drearier\r\n  picture could scarcely have saddened mankind.\r\n\r\n  That this despair was not lasting is due to the genius of an\r\n  English surgeon; and the close of the 18th Century, which had\r\n  much to darken it, will be remembered till the end of human\r\n  history for the greatest physical good ever yet given by science\r\n  to the world.\r\n\r\nThen followed the Jennerian legend, related in highly fabulous\r\nform with sundry extensions from Simon’s private fancy. It is\r\nsufficient to reassert that Jenner did not introduce cowpox. On\r\nthe contrary, he rejected cowpox for horsegrease cowpox; and such\r\nwas his prescription because he knew from the evidence of his\r\nneighbourhood that cowpox afforded no protection from smallpox.\r\nIt is true that when Pearson discredited horsegrease cowpox,\r\nand recommended cowpox, Jenner dropped his prescription, and\r\nput himself forward as the discoverer of cowpox; but it is also\r\ntrue that in subsequent years he resumed his original position,\r\nand indeed dispensed with the cow altogether, and, like Sacco of\r\nMilan and De Carro of Vienna, used and diffused horsegrease or\r\nhorsepox neat, describing the equine virus as “the true and genuine\r\nlife-preserving fluid.” Of all this, however, Simon was either\r\nignorant, or preferred to say nothing. He, too, dropped cowpox as a\r\ndisease of the cow. Referring to a conjecture by Jenner that cowpox\r\nwas “smallpox in a milder form,” he maintained that the conjecture\r\nhad been verified by Gassner in 1801; by Thiele in 1836; by Ceely\r\nin 1839; and commercially by Badcock of Brighton in 1840. Again\r\nand again Badcock derived fresh stocks of vaccine virus from cows\r\nartificially infected with smallpox; having vaccinated with such\r\nvirus more than 14,000 persons, and having furnished supplies of it\r\nto more than 400 medical practitioners--\r\n\r\n  It has been made matter of almost familiar experiment that the\r\n  infection of Smallpox may, by inoculation, be communicated\r\n  from Man to Cow; that its result is an eruption of vesicles\r\n  presenting the physical characters of Cowpox; that the lymph from\r\n  these vesicles, if implanted in the skin of the human subject,\r\n  produces the ordinary local phenomena of Vaccination; that the\r\n  person so vaccinated diffuses no atmospheric infection; that the\r\n  lymph generated by him may be transferred, with reproductive\r\n  powers, to other unprotected persons; and that, on the conclusion\r\n  of this artificial disorder, _neither renewed Vaccination,\r\n  nor inoculation with Smallpox, nor the closest contact and\r\n  cohabitation with smallpox patients, will occasion him to betray\r\n  any remnant of susceptibility to infection_. (P. xiv.)\r\n\r\nThus were the discredited claims of Jenner revived and reasserted\r\nfor a new variety of virus--for smallpox inoculated on the cow!\r\nEven revaccination was pronounced impossible, and logically; for\r\nrevaccination implies susceptibility to infection. It was idle,\r\nhowever, to shelter this new development under Jenner’s authority.\r\nWhen Jenner said that cowpox was smallpox in milder form, he meant\r\nin process the reverse of Simon’s interpretation. He meant that\r\nsmallpox came to man from the horse through the cow; and not that\r\nthe cow contracted smallpox from man. Showing his nephew a horse\r\nwith greasy heels, he said, “There is the source of smallpox.”[289]\r\nWhen the stock of cowpox for vaccination ran low, Jenner feared\r\nit might be difficult to enlarge the supply. Why? Because farmers\r\nexercised such precaution, since they learnt that cowpox was\r\nderived from horsegrease, that the disease among cows had become\r\nwell nigh extinct. Possibly Jenner was mistaken: possibly cowpox\r\noriginated in smallpox: but what Simon described as “settled” in\r\n1857 exists to this day in vehement dispute. Simon’s prescription\r\nwas practically a fresh discovery--a new departure in vaccination.\r\nIt recalls the practice of the variolators who took virus for\r\ntimid patients from healthy subjects inoculated with mild smallpox;\r\nthe supposition being that the virulence of the mild pox was\r\nmeliorated in them, they playing the part that Ceely and Badcock\r\nassigned to the cow. Thus when Dimsdale variolated the Empress\r\nCatharine, it was with smallpox mitigated in the person of a strong\r\nyoung man. Had Dimsdale substituted a cow for a man, he would not\r\nonly have anticipated Jenner, but the later revelation and practice\r\nof Ceely and Badcock--“the greatest physical good ever given by\r\nscience to the world.”\r\n\r\nSimon next went on to describe “Smallpox since the Use of\r\nVaccination,” concerning which these observations may suffice--\r\n\r\n1st--Smallpox was abating over Europe prior to the introduction\r\nof vaccination, notwithstanding the stimulation of the disease by\r\nvariolation.\r\n\r\n2nd--The discredit cast upon variolation by vaccination threw\r\nsmallpox out of culture, and to that extent abated smallpox.\r\n\r\n3rd--It was absurd to ascribe the decline of smallpox to\r\nvaccination in countries where only a part of the people were\r\nvaccinated; and usually, as in England, a part least liable to\r\nsmallpox.\r\n\r\nThese considerations, sufficiently developed in preceding chapters,\r\nnullify the conclusion, supported by elaborate statistical tables,\r\nthat vaccination was the cause of the decline in smallpox. The\r\nasserted cause was incommensurate with the effect.\r\n\r\nAnother remark remains, namely, that all vaccination was taken by\r\nSimon for effective vaccination, except where smallpox followed,\r\nand then suspicion was thrown on the virus or the time and mode\r\nof its administration. But under his own definition of virus,\r\nnamely, smallpox inoculated on the cow, the greater part, if\r\nnot the whole, of the vaccinations accomplished were with virus\r\naltogether diverse--with cowpox that owed nothing to smallpox,\r\nwith equine cowpox, with horsepox, and much else known only to\r\nomniscience. Yet it was to these heterogeneous inoculations,\r\nmodified inscrutably in transit from patient to patient, that the\r\nsubsidence of smallpox was attributed! In a word, whatever was\r\nanywhere or by anybody _called_ vaccination, served, according to\r\nSimon, to exterminate smallpox. Where shall we find an epithet for\r\nsuch crass assurance, with neither science or common-sense to lend\r\nit the gloss of probability!\r\n\r\nThe succeeding chapter, “Alleged Drawbacks from the Advantages of\r\nVaccination, and alleged Dangers of its Practice,” was as abusive\r\nas unfair. It is admitted that much nonsense has been written\r\nagainst vaccination, and, if the pot may call the kettle black,\r\nmuch more nonsense has been circulated in its favour. Vaccination\r\nwas recommended for the improvement of health and the complexion,\r\nfor the cure of skin diseases, for the Plague, for whooping-cough,\r\nfor rot in sheep, and for distemper in dogs--Jenner himself\r\nvaccinating the King’s staghounds. But to what purpose such\r\nrecrimination? The prime charge against vaccination is, that it\r\nis a disease which neither averts or mitigates smallpox; and the\r\nsecond is, that it frequently excites and sometimes conveys other\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\nSimon waxed eloquent on the absurdity of referring the origin of\r\ncertain scrofulous affections to vaccination, whilst describing\r\nsuch affections as notorious sequences of smallpox; but where\r\nwas the absurdity if vaccination was (as he held) a mild form\r\nof smallpox?--the mild disease serving equally as a ferment or\r\nexcitant of evil humours. In his furious contempt he forgot his\r\nscience and logic, and implicitly conceded all for which rational\r\nadversaries of vaccination contended.\r\n\r\nIn the same reckless vein he asked, “Is properly performed\r\nvaccination an absolutely inoffensive proceeding?” and answered--\r\n\r\n  Not at all, nor does it pretend to be so. The very meaning of\r\n  the thing is, that it shall artificially and designedly produce\r\n  a transient and trifling indisposition; that for some days the\r\n  infant shall be uncomfortable with a sore arm and a slight\r\n  irritation of the adjacent axillary glands, and a perceptible\r\n  amount of general feverishness. (P. lx.)\r\n\r\nHere we agree, and here disagree--agree as to the disease, disagree\r\nas to the determination of its limits. First, the virus is in\r\nquality indefinite; and second, the recipient of the virus is a\r\ncomplex of qualities indefinite; so that, as Dr. Mead observed,\r\nwhen smallpox was used for inoculation, “it is more material into\r\nwhat kind of body it be infused, than out of what it is taken.”\r\nAs pathologists freely allow, it is impossible to predicate the\r\ntransformations of organic poisons in the animal frame. A vigorous\r\ninfant may throw off the virus, designated vaccine, and suffer no\r\napparent harm, but the same virus may operate very differently in\r\ncontact with debility and disease; so that, in the words of James,\r\nwe have to say, “Behold how great a matter a little fire kindleth!”\r\nThe conditions of vaccination are essentially those of hazard; the\r\nissues are those of a game of chance; the result at the best being\r\na risk for naught.\r\n\r\nSimon, too, was positive as to the impossibility of the\r\ninvaccination of syphilis--a fact no longer in question, save as\r\nto the degree of frequency. And here, also, in his recklessness he\r\nforgot consistency, saying--\r\n\r\n  When a child is born with the heritage of syphilis (a very\r\n  frequent incident, if its parents have been suffering from that\r\n  infection) the characteristic symptoms do not appear till some\r\n  weeks after birth; and then the scandal discloses itself. (P.\r\n  lxvi.)\r\n\r\nJust so; and before disclosure the child is vaccinated, and serving\r\nas vaccinifer, the latent syphilis is inoculated and diffused.\r\n\r\nVaccination, according to Simon, was easy--“The mere manual trick\r\nis learnt from a minute’s teaching and an hour’s practice.”\r\nDifficulty begins in the selection of proper subjects for the\r\nrite, for which none are qualified, save the healthy; and for the\r\nrecognition of health a trained eye is wanted--\r\n\r\n  If sickly children are vaccinated, children breeding other\r\n  disorders, children having skin disease, children teething and\r\n  the like, the results must be at least unsatisfactory, and\r\n  possibly dangerous. (P. lxii.)\r\n\r\nIf such children are exempted from vaccination, how can vaccination\r\never approach universality? And when universal vaccination is\r\neffected, as it is frequently effected, how can it fail to be\r\nattended with “results, at least unsatisfactory, and possibly\r\ndangerous”?\r\n\r\nMore difficult than the selection of subjects is the selection of\r\nvirus for the rite; and the manifold dangers and the requisite\r\nprecautions were thus specified--\r\n\r\n  Especially as regards the quality of vaccine lymph, the careless\r\n  or uneducated vaccinator is using a dangerous weapon. It is only\r\n  during part of the course of a vaccine vesicle that its lymph\r\n  is suitable for further vaccinations: for after a given moment,\r\n  at which the contents of the vesicle possess their maximum of\r\n  simple contagiousness, they tend more and more toward the quality\r\n  of common inflammatory products; and matter now taken from the\r\n  vesicle is no longer the simple agent of a specific infection,\r\n  but has less efficiency for its real purpose, and is specially\r\n  able to produce other undesired results.\r\n\r\n  A danger of somewhat similar kind is that of taking lymph from\r\n  vesicles which already have been accidentally ruptured, or where\r\n  from any other cause, local or constitutional, their specific\r\n  fluid is likely to have been modified by common irritative\r\n  processes.\r\n\r\n  The danger of taking matter from irritated vesicles, and from\r\n  vesicles at too advanced a period of their course, is one which\r\n  circumstances render frequent; and there is reason to believe\r\n  that, in at least a very large proportion of those cases where\r\n  abnormal effects have resulted from so-called vaccination, it has\r\n  been the employment of this ambiguous irritative matter which has\r\n  occasioned the mischief and scandal.\r\n\r\n  Still more critical changes occur in lymph when removed from the\r\n  body, unless appropriate means be taken to preserve it; for,\r\n  under the influence of air and moisture, it tends, like other\r\n  dead organic matter, to putrid decomposition; and inoculation\r\n  with it, when thus changing, can hardly be more useful or less\r\n  dangerous than a casual scratch inflicted in the dissecting room.\r\n  (P. lxii.)\r\n\r\nNo one who considers this limitation of vaccination to the\r\nhealthy, and these prescriptions as to the collection and\r\nexhibition of “lymph,” can fail to see that the charges of injury\r\nand death brought against the common practice were allowed and\r\naccounted for--were, indeed, the unavoidable associates of that\r\npractice. Vaccination, as described by Simon, was an ideal\r\noperation--impracticable on any ordinary terms. His contention and\r\nhis approbation were reserved for “properly-performed vaccination”\r\non a healthy child, with innocuous virus, the proof of each\r\ncondition being discovered in the result. If unsatisfactory or\r\ninjurious, or deadly, then the vaccination could not have been\r\n“properly performed”--either the child was unhealthy, or the virus\r\nwas at fault.\r\n\r\nNor can we wonder that the people, having experience of the\r\nuselessness and misery of the virulent practice should, undismayed\r\nby the terror of smallpox, decline its observance; nor that those\r\nwho made gain thereby should, distrusting their power to prevail by\r\nreason, invoke legislation to enforce the imposture, calling in the\r\npoliceman to support the doctor, as of old the soldier supported\r\nthe priest.\r\n\r\nStill further to sustain his case, Simon addressed the following\r\nCircular of Questions to upwards of 500 medical men--\r\n\r\n  I.--_Have you any doubt that successful Vaccination confers on\r\n  persons subject to its influence a very large exemption from\r\n  attacks of Smallpox, and almost absolute security against death\r\n  by that disease?_\r\n\r\n  II.--_Have you any reason to believe or suspect that vaccinated\r\n  persons, in being rendered less susceptible of Smallpox, become\r\n  more susceptible of any other infective disease, or of phthisis;\r\n  or that their health is in any other way disadvantageously\r\n  affected?_\r\n\r\n  III.--_Have you any reason to believe or suspect that lymph, from\r\n  a true Jennerian vesicle, has ever been a vehicle of syphilitic,\r\n  scrofulous, or other constitutional infection to the vaccinated\r\n  person; or that unintentional inoculation with some other\r\n  disease, instead of the proposed Vaccination, has occurred in the\r\n  hands of a duly educated medical practitioner?_\r\n\r\n  IV.--_Do you (assuming due provisions to exist for a skilful\r\n  performance of the operation) recommend that, except for special\r\n  reasons in individual cases, Vaccination should be universally\r\n  performed at early periods of life?_\r\n\r\nWhilst these questions were framed to draw the answers required,\r\nyet, however modified, the tenor of the returns would have been\r\nmuch the same. We might confidently predict uniform replies, if a\r\ncircular were addressed to 500 clergymen soliciting their judgment\r\nas to the disendowment of the Church, to 500 Nonconformist divines\r\nas to the benefit of hearing sermons, to 500 military men as to\r\nthe expediency of an imminent war, to 500 naval officers as to an\r\nenlargement of the navy, or to 500 publicans as to the justice of\r\nlocal option. Nor is there sense in attributing value to testimony\r\nto be had on demand by the yard. It is brought forth as of course,\r\nand to expect otherwise is to expect what is contrary to nature.\r\n\r\nIt will be said, “Do you really mean that medical men defend\r\nvaccination because it pays?” In no other sense, I reply, than\r\nas clergymen or publicans defend their vested interests. Medical\r\nmen among themselves make no secret of their pecuniary interest\r\nin vaccination, as any one may see who reads their journals; and\r\nSimon’s advocacy culminated in a demand for more liberal pay, as\r\nthe only guarantee for “properly-performed vaccination.”\r\n\r\nWe may view the matter in another light. Suppose a circular had\r\nbeen addressed to 500 medical men fifty years ago, as to the\r\nutility of bleeding, or blistering, or salivation, would not the\r\ntenor of the answers have been equally uniform with Simon’s in\r\nfavour of vaccination? Where are these practices now? But suppose\r\nany one of them had obtained legislative sanction and endowment,\r\ncan we doubt that it would have survived to this day, certified as\r\nsalutary and harmless by the gross of the medical profession? Let\r\nus clear our minds of cant. The assumption that men’s convictions\r\n(I except the moral aristocracy) are not controlled by their\r\nselfish interests (often enough the reverse of their true ones) is\r\ncant.\r\n\r\nAmong those interrogated was Dr. Joseph Hamernik of Prague,\r\nwhose developed answers form a paper which, by reason of the\r\nindependence, acumen and philosophy displayed, constitutes the\r\ndistinction of Simon’s collection of documents.\r\n\r\nFirst, Hamernik inquired whether cowpox and smallpox had any\r\nrelation to each other, deciding that they were diverse and\r\nindependent diseases. Vaccinated persons may be attacked with\r\nsmallpox during the development of the cowpox vesicle, or a few\r\ndays after the drying-up of the same. When inoculation is made with\r\na mixture of cowpox and smallpox, there ensue a vaccine vesicle on\r\nthe site of the puncture and a variolous eruption over the body. In\r\nfact, it is not uncommon to find cowpox and smallpox flourishing\r\nsimultaneously on the same individual. Under some conditions,\r\nthe one disease appears to stifle the other. Thus a powerful\r\nepidemic of smallpox will prevent the development of cowpox,\r\nillustrating the Hippocratic aphorism, _Duobus doloribus simul\r\nobortis--vehementior obscurat alterum_, exactly as happens when\r\nother diseases simultaneously invade the human organism. Again, in\r\nwell-marked epidemics, cowpox does not protect from smallpox, even\r\nafter repeated vaccinations. Under stress of such experience, the\r\nconfidence in such vaccination was much shaken in England during\r\nthe epidemics of 1825 and 1838. Vaccination was likewise found\r\nuseless in the epidemics of Paris in 1825 and Marseilles in 1828.\r\n“Nor can revaccination achieve what vaccination cannot,” said Dr.\r\nBrown of Musselburgh. The revaccinated die of smallpox like other\r\npeople, as is proved by the official returns of the armies of\r\nWurtemburg and Prussia--\r\n\r\n  Revaccinations among civilians in Bohemia are extremely rare,\r\n  and hence I am unable to cite many cases. I only saw two persons\r\n  who had been revaccinated die at the Prague Hospital--a Russian\r\n  officer in the guards, and a physician from Bremen.\r\n\r\n  There is no validity in the statement that epidemics of\r\n  Smallpox are arrested and made milder by rapid Vaccination and\r\n  Revaccination; unless medical men could test the accuracy of\r\n  their verdict, as lawyers do, by a new trial. Until they can do\r\n  so, we must admit that there are cases and epidemics of Smallpox\r\n  light and severe. It was so before Vaccination was heard of, and\r\n  is likely so to continue longer than Vaccination will endure.\r\n\r\nSecond, turning to the examination of the characters of smallpox\r\nbefore and after vaccination, he observed--\r\n\r\n  If Vaccination really possessed the properties ascribed to it, a\r\n  change must long ere this have taken place in the character of\r\n  Smallpox, both of the sporadic and epidemic kind. Smallpox has\r\n  been minutely described by pathologists before Vaccination was\r\n  introduced, and in such a manner that one would think they had\r\n  seen the disease in the wards of our hospitals. Indeed the best\r\n  pathologists of our time, who have paid special attention to\r\n  Smallpox, agree that they could add nothing to the descriptions\r\n  of Rhazes (who died at Bagdad A.D. 930), of Sydenham, 1675, of\r\n  Richard Mead, 1754, and of John Huxham, 1764. Mead admits a light\r\n  and severe Smallpox, and Huxham observed such slight epidemics\r\n  that no fever appeared in the whole course of the disease. At\r\n  present, pathologists would hardly class such cases with _Variola\r\n  Vera_; they would, perhaps, call them _Variola Modificata_; or\r\n  let them figure in their tables as _Varioloid_ and proofs of the\r\n  good results of Vaccination.\r\n\r\n  It may be that in former centuries Smallpox assumed more\r\n  frequently the malignant or hæmorrhagic type; but this\r\n  circumstance can in nowise be explained by the intervention of\r\n  Vaccination. Even as many individuals of the animal and vegetable\r\n  kingdoms have disappeared, so also have great changes taken place\r\n  in the number and severity of diseases. When scurvy, putrid\r\n  fevers, dysentery, etc., were commoner, Smallpox was likely to\r\n  be more malignant: so much was due to the prevalent poverty and\r\n  scarcity throughout Europe. Pauperism, want and hunger, are\r\n  always characterised by a proportionate frequency, gravity and\r\n  diffusion of various diseases.\r\n\r\nThen, too, much of the mortality of smallpox in former times was\r\nattributable to maltreatment; and Hamernik illustrated what was\r\npossible under good treatment, by adducing his own experience when\r\nthe smallpox wards in Prague were under his care. “The recoveries\r\nwere, very speedy, and the deaths less than five per cent.”\r\n\r\nThird, he held that the doctrine of Jenner was opposed to\r\nrecognised pathological principles. Observation has taught us\r\nthat two severe diseases cannot affect an individual at the same\r\ntime. Thus typhus cannot go on with scarlet fever or smallpox, nor\r\ntuberculous with cancerous disease. The rule, however, only holds\r\ngood with diseases that affect the whole organism. It does not\r\napply to trifling or local affections, to which latter category\r\ncowpox belongs. The best marked diseases pursue their course\r\ncontemporaneously with cowpox; and the scars of the punctures\r\nthrough which it has been inoculated have no more influence in\r\naverting smallpox than any similar scars resulting from analogous\r\ncutaneous lesion--\r\n\r\n  I consider it as a general pathological law that morbid actions\r\n  which have entirely run their course can have absolutely no\r\n  influence whatever upon the subsequent pathological reactions of\r\n  the individual. Hence it is possible to suffer repeatedly from\r\n  smallpox, scarlet fever, typhus, pneumonia, tubercular disease,\r\n  etc. Nay, Smallpox has been observed five different times upon\r\n  the same patient. Keeping these incontestable facts in view,\r\n  it becomes a matter of indifference what was Jenner’s doctrine\r\n  relative to Cowpox, whether identical with Smallpox, or whether\r\n  antagonistic to Smallpox or anything else. Nor can Variolation be\r\n  advocated, if we pay attention to the same pathological law. A\r\n  variolous attack, when once passed away, has no more influence,\r\n  as regards future events, than any other disease. The reason why\r\n  many escape Smallpox altogether, why some have it twice, why the\r\n  inoculation of the disease has sometimes no effect, or why some\r\n  can inhale its effluvia with impunity, is entirely concealed from\r\n  us. As Cowpox is a disease foreign to man, it is particularly for\r\n  graziers that further investigations can be interesting.\r\n\r\nIn answer to the Second Question, whether vaccinated persons, being\r\nless susceptible to smallpox, become more susceptible of any other\r\ninfective disease, or of phthisis, Hamernik answered that the\r\ninterrogation implied what, for reasons given, he disputed, namely,\r\nthat the vaccinated were less liable to smallpox--\r\n\r\n  The assumption is perfectly gratuitous. Epidemics of Smallpox\r\n  occur at widely varying periods, with different degrees of\r\n  intensity, prevalence, and duration. The Vaccinated and the\r\n  Unvaccinated suffer in every epidemic; and the influence of\r\n  Vaccination cannot be determined from the character and progress\r\n  of the disease in individual cases.\r\n\r\n  I am aware that the beneficial influence of Vaccination is\r\n  inferred from the registers of public vaccinators; but I freely\r\n  confess I consider these books as perfectly valueless; and I may\r\n  add that the most intelligent of the gentlemen who keep them\r\n  fully concur in my opinion. In this country we know full well\r\n  how vaccinators are situated; and that little confidence can be\r\n  placed in them is generally acknowledged.\r\n\r\nTo the Third Question, whether syphilitic, scrofulous, and other\r\nconstitutional affections are communicable in vaccination, Hamernik\r\nanswered with regret in the affirmative. It was true that the\r\ncontrary opinion was written at large. Taupin testified that he had\r\ntaken virus from children suffering from typhus, scarlet fever,\r\nmeasles, smallpox, itch, inflammation of the brain, the lungs and\r\nthe intestines; from chorea, epilepsy, scrofula, tuberculosis, and\r\nring-worm, and no harm had resulted to the vaccinated; and Launauzy\r\nagrees with Taupin, that it is mere prejudice and groundless to\r\nsuppose that cowpox taken, from unhealthy children can inflict any\r\nhurt--\r\n\r\n  On this head, it will be sufficient for me to remark that to\r\n  arrive at a knowledge of the amount of mischief such doctrine has\r\n  brought upon mankind, it would be necessary to learn how much the\r\n  promulgators gained by their unlimited favour for Vaccination.\r\n\r\nProfessor Waller, of Prague, has proved that syphilis may be\r\ninoculated by means of a patient’s blood; and as blood is often\r\ndrawn with the virus of vaccination, no doubt can exist as to the\r\npossibility of doing in this manner a vast amount of mischief.\r\nMonteggio taught at Milan in 1814, that when a syphilitic child\r\nis vaccinated, the result is a vesicle containing both kinds of\r\nvirus; and Carioli expressed the same opinion in 1821. Marcolini\r\nrelates that, on 16th June, 1814, ten children were vaccinated from\r\na syphilitic infant, who died at the end of a few months, and five\r\nof the ten children syphilised from her.\r\n\r\nIn answer to the Fourth Question, whether vaccination should be\r\nuniversally performed at early periods of life? Hamernik replied,\r\nthat he obviously could not recommend a practice which put health,\r\nand even life itself, in jeopardy for no certain advantage. Any\r\nefficient examination of virus was impracticable. Vaccinators may\r\nset to work with zeal and care, but their energy soon cools, and\r\nthey settle into perfunctory routine. Government should assume\r\na passive attitude toward vaccination; or if people _will_ be\r\nvaccinated, something might be done to minimise the danger. If the\r\npractice is assigned to salaried functionaries, they are sure to\r\ncreate evidence to justify and perpetuate their official existence.\r\nLeft to common option--\r\n\r\n  Vaccinations would every year become fewer, until at last\r\n  we should read with astonishment in old newspapers how much\r\n  attention was once paid to the practice.\r\n\r\nWhilst the majority of Simon’s correspondents conjured up arguments\r\nfor vaccination, their facts, apart from their rhetoric, conveyed\r\nmuch that was instructive. For instance, a register was produced\r\nof the deaths in Christ’s Hospital, London, for the century,\r\n1751-1850. The boys in that charity boarding-school numbered about\r\n550; and in twenty-five years, 1751-75, there died of smallpox 22,\r\nand in twenty-five years, 1776-1800, there died 9. In the fifty\r\nsucceeding years, 1801-50, there died 1, and he in 1820. Thereon\r\nwe are asked to recognise the efficacy of vaccination! But what\r\nreduced the mortality from 22 in 1751-75 to 9 in 1776-1800? And if\r\n550 boys in the centre of London, in the flux of constant coming\r\nand going, escaped with so few fatalities from smallpox, what comes\r\nof the asserted omnipresence and havoc of the disease in London\r\nbefore the introduction of vaccination? Across the street from\r\nChrist’s Hospital stands Newgate, which, during the same years, was\r\nhaunted with jail fever; which fever was gradually suppressed, and\r\nby what charm? Certainly by no rite analogous to vaccination. Why,\r\nthen, should we be required to admit an agency in the reduction\r\nof smallpox which played no part in the reduction of a cognate\r\ndisease? In times when smallpox was frequent in Christ’s Hospital,\r\nabout as little regard was paid to stench and ventilation as in the\r\nprison over the way. In later years a more wholesome atmosphere\r\nprevailed, and concurrently the diet of the scholars was altered\r\nand improved--changes in themselves as sufficient to account for\r\nthe disappearance of smallpox from the school as for typhus from\r\nthe jail.\r\n\r\nThe like indifference to variations of circumstance vitiated\r\nthroughout the generalisations of Simon and his correspondents.\r\nAssuming that the conditions of life and the characters of disease\r\nremained unaltered, smallpox was treated as uninfluenced by aught\r\nbut vaccination. It needs no words to condemn such procedure as\r\nradically unsound; and men, otherwise sane, only persist in it\r\nas they persist in similar hallucinations. Even the matter of\r\nvaccination they left undefined, or differently defined. Whatever\r\nwas called vaccination was taken for vaccination, and the reduction\r\nof smallpox ascribed to it. In Jenner’s hands it was first\r\nhorsegrease cowpox, then cowpox, and lastly horsepox. According to\r\nSimon true vaccination was effected with smallpox inoculated on\r\nthe cow. Which, we demand, was the virus that wrought the numerous\r\nmiracles we are summoned to believe? Is it indeed true that there\r\nis nothing certain about vaccination save the vaccinator’s fee? Is\r\nit that, as in other thaumaturgical performances, virtue resides\r\nin the performer, described by Simon as “the duly educated medical\r\npractitioner?” Is it argued that vaccination is a species of\r\nincantation, and that it matters little what is the vehicle of\r\nthe rite, its efficacy being dependent on the credentials of the\r\nadministrator? Or that what is believed to be good against smallpox\r\n_is_ good against smallpox, the charm consisting in the faith\r\nwherewith it is received?\r\n\r\nThe belief in vaccination and its proofs is much akin to the belief\r\nin witchcraft and its proofs. To argue about witchcraft, and to\r\nanswer its proofs, was to become a sort of partner in the delusion.\r\nDeliverance lay in the unqualified denial of the imposture; and\r\nfrom that firm ground difficulty was solved and the inexplicable\r\ndisappeared. As soon as the position of absolute disbelief is\r\ntaken up, the plausibilities in favour of vaccination resolve\r\nthemselves into the element of phantasy, so powerful and yet so\r\nevanescent. The arts of its advocates then become manifest with all\r\nthe dodges, conscious and unconscious, whereby the light of truth\r\nis shut out, and the gloom requisite for visions provided. The\r\nstory of vaccination is the story of many other impostures which\r\nhave bewildered and afflicted mankind, and the study of one is the\r\nrevelation of others.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[288] _Papers relating to the History and Practice of Vaccination._\r\nAddressed to the President of the General Board of Health, and\r\npresented to both Houses of Parliament by command of Her Majesty.\r\nLondon, 1857. Pp. lxxxiii. and 188.\r\n\r\n[289] Baron’s _Life of Jenner_, vol. i., p. 135.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\n\r\nCOMPULSION INTENSIFIED--1861 AND 1867.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Vaccination Act of 1853 imposed a forfeit not exceeding 20s. on\r\nany parent or guardian who failed to have a child vaccinated within\r\nthree months of birth; but experience revealed a grave defect in\r\nthe law. There was no provision for the prosecution of defaulters;\r\nand those who had no faith in vaccination, or accounted it a\r\nnuisance, enjoyed immunity without serious annoyance. To meet this\r\ndefect a bill was introduced to Parliament in 1861, providing that\r\n“the guardians or overseers of any parish may appoint some person\r\nto institute and conduct proceedings for enforcing obedience.” The\r\nbill was passed through the House of Commons under the care of\r\nMr. Robert Lowe, meeting with little resistance, and with less in\r\nthe Lords. In vindicating the measure, 10th July, 1861, Mr. Lowe\r\nobserved--\r\n\r\n  Parliament in 1853 passed an Act for Compulsory Vaccination, but\r\n  owing to a defect in the provision of expenses for prosecution,\r\n  it has fallen into desuetude. When the present Government was\r\n  formed in 1859, a clause was introduced to the Public Health\r\n  Act correcting the defect; but under pressure of the Member for\r\n  Finsbury [Mr. Thomas Duncombe] I surrendered it. It has been to\r\n  me a bitter reflection that I did so; for I am convinced that the\r\n  sacrifice of that clause has occasioned the loss of thousands of\r\n  lives in this country.\r\n\r\nThe question is sometimes asked, Why is it that association with\r\nhorses is so prejudicial to morality? This interrogation might be\r\naccompanied with another, namely, Why is it that the advocacy of\r\nvaccination is so frequently associated with romance and rant? That\r\npublic vaccination had fallen into desuetude was untrue. There\r\nwere fluctuations from year to year, but the rate was maintained\r\nwithout practical abatement. That in 1861 it could be said that\r\nthousands of lives had been lost because prosecuting officers were\r\nnot provided in 1859, was romance and rant without mitigation. In\r\nEngland and Wales there died of smallpox--\r\n\r\n    In 1858     6460\r\n       1859     3848\r\n       1860     2749\r\n       1861     1320\r\n       1862     1628\r\n       1863     5964\r\n       1864     7684\r\n       1865     6411\r\n\r\nWhere then were the thousands of lives lost from the formation of\r\nthe Government in 1859 to 1861? and where were the lives saved\r\nafter the enactment of the vital clause? But who that knew Mr.\r\nRobert Lowe could believe that he was convinced that the surrender\r\nof the clause occasioned the loss of thousands of lives, and that\r\nthe loss was to him a bitter reflection? Would not the vulgar\r\nversion of the invocation, _O mihi beate Martine!_ have been\r\nappropriate to the situation?\r\n\r\nFurther, continued Mr. Lowe--\r\n\r\n  From 1837 to 1840 the deaths from Smallpox amounted to 12,000\r\n  a-year. From 1840 to 1863, during which period Vaccination was\r\n  provided by the Poor Law Boards, the annual average of deaths was\r\n  only 5,200. Thus by the diffusion of Vaccination, the mortality\r\n  of Smallpox was reduced by more than one-half. Then in 1853 the\r\n  Compulsory Law came into operation, and its first effect was\r\n  remarkable. The number of vaccinations enormously increased and\r\n  the deaths diminished. In 1854 they sank to 2,808, and in 1855\r\n  to 2,525. Afterwards they gradually increased up to the present\r\n  time [When in fact they never were lower!], the Act having, as I\r\n  already explained, fallen into desuetude. Thus is the efficiency\r\n  of Vaccination established!\r\n\r\nInto such stuff may a clever man descend! The statement was rotten\r\nwith untruth. It was gross misrepresentation to set forth the\r\naverage mortality of 12,000 for the years 1837-40 as permanent\r\nmortality which the Act of 1840 reduced to 5,200. The years\r\n1837-40 embraced a severe epidemic, following years of quiescence\r\nduring which vaccinators had been singing pæans over their\r\nimaginary victory. Holding as we do that smallpox comes and goes\r\nwith indifference to vaccination (unless in so far as it keeps\r\nthe disease alive) the figures cited by Mr. Lowe as completely\r\nillustrate our contention as they nullified his. By no contrivance\r\ncan the fluctuations of smallpox be associated with more or less\r\nvaccination.\r\n\r\nProbably Mr. Lowe was inspired by his medical staff, but, if so, he\r\nmade the inspiration his own, evolving as from personal certainty,\r\nsuch fancy-work as this--\r\n\r\n  Out of 1000 who take Smallpox without being vaccinated 350 die;\r\n  while out of 1000 badly vaccinated only 150 die; but out of 1000\r\n  well vaccinated only 5 die.\r\n\r\nTo which the conclusive answer would have been, that a mortality\r\nof 7 in 20 of the unvaccinated was about double that of smallpox\r\nin the time when all were unvaccinated; and that disregarding the\r\nfactitious classification, the mortality over all cases continued\r\nas it was in the pre-vaccination era. What smallpox was, smallpox\r\nhas remained--discrete, confluent, malignant; each type being\r\nqualified as slight, dangerous, and deadly; the relation of\r\nvaccination to the type being wholly irrelevant.\r\n\r\nFurther, he proclaimed without reserve, that smallpox was\r\ntransmuted to cowpox in the cow--\r\n\r\n  There was a theory started that the efficacy of Vaccination was\r\n  wearing out; but the valuable discovery of Mr. Ceely has set any\r\n  apprehension on that score at rest for ever. Mr. Ceely has proved\r\n  that Smallpox, when taken from the human body and introduced to\r\n  that of the cow, produces Cowpox. It is thus evident that we\r\n  have the means of obtaining Cowpox of the requisite strength to\r\n  any extent. The beautiful discovery has also been made that the\r\n  security of Vaccination may be almost indefinitely increased by\r\n  multiplying the number of punctures.\r\n\r\nThus was mystery dispelled! Cowpox was smallpox diversified in\r\nthe cow, and the lost security of Jenner’s single puncture was\r\nrecovered in tattoo!\r\n\r\nAppealing to the sentiment of medical men in favour of vaccination\r\nas exhibited in the replies to Simon’s queries in 1857--a fallacy\r\nfor conviction which Mr. Lowe would have been quick to detect if\r\nadvanced for any clerical, scholastic, or other trading interest,\r\nhe observed--\r\n\r\n  The terrible malady falls heavily upon young children: in\r\n  Vaccination is their defence. Consider, then, what a painful\r\n  responsibility will rest upon us, if, in the face of almost\r\n  unanimous medical testimony, we leave them to perish, and\r\n  communicate a dreadful contagion throughout the country. These\r\n  children have no discretion of their own; and it is a profanation\r\n  of liberty and self-government to say that any man has a right to\r\n  set up his own sordid and brutal prejudices against such medical\r\n  opinion, and expose his child to disease and death.\r\n\r\nWords, ferocious words; but how do they bear examination? Why\r\nshould disbelief in vaccination be stigmatised as sordid and brutal\r\nprejudice? Why should parliamentary affection for children surpass\r\nparental affection? The argument, if valid, would equally apply to\r\nany matter in which the conviction of a minority was at variance\r\nwith that of a majority; and if in such circumstances the minority\r\nis bound to submission, where is the substance answering to civil\r\nand religious liberty? If the clear scientific persuasion of the\r\nsmallest minority concerning such a matter as vaccination is to be\r\nsubjected to vulgar medical dictation by the brute force of the\r\nmajority, what form of tyranny may not be justified?\r\n\r\n  The Bill [continued Mr. Lowe] which I wish to pass into law is\r\n  very simple. All that it enacts is that Poor Law Boards may\r\n  appoint persons to prosecute those whom the medical officers\r\n  report ought to be prosecuted.\r\n\r\nAnd the bill was passed without division. Mr. Duncombe and Mr.\r\nConingham protested, but neither had mastered the question so as\r\nto offer effective opposition. Mr. Coningham observed that figures\r\nmight be made to prove anything; and as concerned the unanimous\r\nopinion of medical men, they had to bear in mind the saying, “There\r\nis nothing like leather.” If smallpox had fallen off, there were\r\nextensive sanitary improvements to account for the fall; and, for\r\nhis part, he placed his trust much more in better conditions of\r\nlife for the people than in a prescription like vaccination.\r\n\r\nThe Act obtained did not fulfil the expectations of its promoters.\r\nMr. Lowe’s bitter regret for thousands of lives lost in consequence\r\nof his concession to Mr. Duncombe proved to be wasted emotion.\r\nGuardians did not exercise their powers as inquisitors and\r\npersecutors with adequate energy. Sir Morton Peto, in the House of\r\nCommons, on 14th March, 1864, asked--\r\n\r\n  Whether the registration of Vaccination is not a total failure,\r\n  alike for statistical purposes and for the prosecution of\r\n  offenders under the Compulsory Act; and whether it is the\r\n  intention of the Government to amend the law this session.\r\n\r\nTo which Mr. Lowe made answer--\r\n\r\n  It is quite true that the system of registration under the Act\r\n  is very bad, but it would cost a great deal of money to improve\r\n  it. Moreover, even when improved, it would not make the measures\r\n  for compulsion effectual to any extent. The great difficulty of\r\n  working compulsion is not so much due to defective legislation\r\n  as to the reluctance to prosecute poor people for disobedience\r\n  to the law, the neglect of which is countenanced by too many who\r\n  ought to know better. I am sorry, therefore, I cannot hold out\r\n  any hope of improving the system.\r\n\r\nThe medical officers of the Poor Law Board were, however, intent\r\nupon coercive legislation; and Mr. H. A. Bruce, more pliant than\r\nMr. Lowe, introduced a bill of their contriving in 1866, which he\r\nassured the House of Commons “involved no new principle, and merely\r\nconsolidated provisions dispersed over six Acts of Parliament,\r\n_with a few amendments_.” On going into committee on the bill, 11th\r\nApril, 1866, he delivered an elaborate defence of vaccination,\r\nprepared for him by the astute promoters of the measure, starting\r\nin this fashion--\r\n\r\n  At the close of last century Dr. Jenner achieved his immortal\r\n  discovery by which, perhaps, more misery has been prevented\r\n  through the alleviation of pain and the preservation of life than\r\n  by any other discovery that has ever been made.\r\n\r\nSpoken from whatever elevation, nothing divides talk like this from\r\nthat of a quack at a country fair. Having struck the note, Mr.\r\nBruce ran through the familiar gamut of assertion wherewith the\r\nrite of vaccination is supposed to be justified. The following is\r\na sample of the advocacy imposed upon him--\r\n\r\n  A statement has been widely circulated that Syphilis has been\r\n  communicated by Vaccination. Millions of children have been\r\n  vaccinated in the last sixty years, but not a single case has\r\n  occurred in which it has been proved that Syphilis has been\r\n  communicated. A case is alleged to have occurred in France in\r\n  which a child had been vaccinated from another which inherited\r\n  Syphilis, but the surgeon in that case, in taking lymph from\r\n  a child covered with syphilitic blotches, acted in monstrous\r\n  disregard of common prudence and medical knowledge. No such\r\n  case, so far as the most careful medical research can discover,\r\n  has happened in this country.\r\n\r\nWhilst this statement would now incur general discredit, yet even\r\nin 1866 the official prompters of Mr. Bruce presumed over much\r\non public credulity. It was not probable that what vaccinators\r\ndid not wish they would discover; or, if discovered, proclaim.\r\nNevertheless, the denunciation of the “alleged” French instance\r\nwas entirely inconsistent with the contention that syphilis could\r\nnot be communicated from a syphilitic vaccinifer, blotched or\r\nunblotched. So much it was imperative to maintain, for it was\r\nobvious that the complete vaccination of any population must\r\ninvolve infants with latent syphilis whose virus might transfer the\r\ndisease to the untainted. This peril, opponents of vaccination,\r\nfrom Cobbett onwards, had recognised; and as its recognition was\r\nprejudicial to vaccination, its possibility was stoutly outsworn\r\nuntil manifold and indisputable evidence compelled its admission,\r\nand shifted the question to the extent of its frequency.\r\n\r\nMr. Henley, following Mr. Bruce, spoke some homely sense--\r\n\r\n  We all know that when we want anything of the kind done, the\r\n  medical man entertains us with a fine cock-and-bull story about\r\n  waiting until he can get lymph from a healthy child. This caution\r\n  implies risk; and though it is said that not a single case of\r\n  injury has occurred in sixty years, yet nobody will persuade me\r\n  that medical men take all these pains (where they are well paid\r\n  and watched) if there are not grounds for the exercise of care.\r\n  Undoubtedly it was an abomination to take vaccine from a diseased\r\n  child, but how is a public vaccinator to know that any child is\r\n  diseased? If he inquires too particularly, he will run the risk\r\n  of a slapped face from the mother for his trouble.\r\n\r\nMr. Henley also drew attention to the claims made for vaccination,\r\ncoupled with the admission that the greater part of it was good for\r\nlittle--\r\n\r\n  One remarkable statement has been made--that there has been an\r\n  examination of 500,000 children belonging to the humbler classes\r\n  chiefly affected by Compulsory Vaccination. Of the number so\r\n  examined only one in eight was found to have been perfectly\r\n  vaccinated, which fact involves the further fact that seven out\r\n  of the eight were imperfectly vaccinated, or not vaccinated at\r\n  all. If only one in eight has been perfectly vaccinated, great\r\n  doubt will come upon many people’s minds as to the matter with\r\n  which the others have been inoculated.\r\n\r\nMuch in the bill was crude and impracticable, and Mr. Ayrton\r\nexpressed the sense of many in the House when he observed--\r\n\r\n  The bill before us is badly drawn, and bears too much the\r\n  marks of its official origin. Great powers have been taken for\r\n  the vaccinating department, but nothing is provided for the\r\n  protection of the public. It seems to me that if Vaccination is\r\n  to be enforced by penalties, public vaccinators should be subject\r\n  to penalties for inefficient and injudicious work. I have been\r\n  entrusted with a great many petitions against the bill, and I\r\n  have been much impressed with the admission that the existing\r\n  system of Vaccination has entirely failed in effecting its\r\n  object. The bill will have to be referred to a Committee, and as\r\n  many believe that Vaccination does as much harm as good, I trust\r\n  the members will not be fettered in their inquiries.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say the asserted failure of vaccination was\r\nan artifice to induce Parliament to pass the bill. The public\r\nvaccinations for 1863, 1864, and 1865, were as numerous as ever,\r\nand accompanied with a marked increase of smallpox. No doubt\r\nvaccination was a failure, but in a different sense from that in\r\nwhich the word was used to acquire increase of power and pay for\r\nthe application of the rite. The bill was referred to a select\r\ncommittee, who reported; but the Conservatives having displaced the\r\nLiberals, it was withdrawn. Mr. Corry, in announcing the fact to\r\nthe House of Commons, 23rd July, 1866, said--\r\n\r\n  I have ascertained that the measure is likely to meet with great\r\n  opposition on both sides of the House; and it is, therefore, very\r\n  doubtful whether it could be carried at this late period of the\r\n  session. Moreover, some of its provisions require further and\r\n  careful consideration.\r\n\r\nThe bill was framed and promoted by the Poor Law Board,\r\nindependently of Liberals and Conservatives, the problem of the\r\nmedical officials being, “How far is it possible to obtain the\r\nassent of Parliament to what we consider desirable.” There were\r\nlimits to parliamentary complaisance, however wide, and, informed\r\nby the experience of 1866, a revised bill was introduced to the\r\nHouse of Commons by Lord Robert Montagu in 1867, who, like his\r\npredecessors, reproduced the instructions of his advisers with\r\nsufficient flavour to pass them off as his own. A portion of his\r\nbusiness was to obtain recognition for the payment of extra fees\r\nfor successful vaccination--\r\n\r\n  When an Inspector reports that certain Vaccinations are of the\r\n  1st class, the Public Vaccinator will receive 1s. over and\r\n  above the sum paid by the Guardians for each Vaccination he has\r\n  performed. If the Vaccinations are reported of the 2nd class, he\r\n  will receive 8d. For 3rd class Vaccinations nothing in excess of\r\n  the Guardians’ contract fee will be paid.\r\n\r\nThis graduation of vaccination excited no comment though why aught\r\nsave first-class should have been accounted tolerable, or paid for,\r\nwas far from obvious. The possible amount chargeable for these\r\nawards was thus estimated--\r\n\r\n  The ratio of children born to the population is about 3½ per\r\n  cent., which gives 700,000 a year for the population of 20\r\n  millions. Reckoning that four-fifths of these children, or\r\n  560,000, are vaccinated gratuitously during the year, the\r\n  expenditure will be £28,000 if all the Vaccinations are 1st\r\n  class, and £18,500 if 2nd class. Shall we, then, think it too\r\n  much if, for a sum between £18,500 and £28,000 we ensure that\r\n  there shall never occur a case of smallpox, and that we save\r\n  7,000 lives a year?\r\n\r\nSuch was the argument put into the mouth of Lord Robert Montagu for\r\nthe persuasion of Parliament! Only pay an extra price for first and\r\nsecond class vaccination, and not a case of smallpox shall occur\r\nin England, and 7,000 lives a year shall be saved! When we inquire\r\nwhere the 7,000 lives a year were lost, we discover how boldly the\r\ncredulity of Parliament was imposed upon. There died of smallpox in\r\nEngland and Wales--\r\n\r\n    In 1861    1,320\r\n       1862    1,628\r\n       1863    5,964\r\n       1864    7,684\r\n       1865    6,411\r\n       1866    2,977\r\n\r\nWhere, then, were the 7,000 lives to save? In 1864 the mortality\r\nexceeded 7,000; but to select an extreme year and represent it\r\nas ordinary would have incurred a sharp epithet if practised in\r\nfinance instead of smallpox.\r\n\r\nA similar fable of salvation from smallpox was related by Lord\r\nRobert Montagu concerning Scotland. He said--\r\n\r\n  It is wiser to save people’s lives than to consult their\r\n  prejudices. The example of Scotland shows the value of a\r\n  thorough-going Vaccination Act. The measure for that country has\r\n  reduced the smallpox death-rate from 2,000 to 120 per annum.\r\n\r\nThe Act to extend and make Vaccination compulsory in Scotland was\r\npassed in 1863--an Act little else than superfluous, for the people\r\nwere vaccinated without it. There died of smallpox in Scotland--\r\n\r\n    In 1859     682\r\n       1860   1,495\r\n       1861     766\r\n       1862     426\r\n              -----\r\n              3,369\r\n\r\n    In 1863   1,648\r\n       1864   1,741\r\n       1865     383\r\n       1866     200\r\n              -----\r\n              3,972\r\n\r\nThe average of these eight years was 907 deaths annually; and one\r\ninquires with some amaze, Where were the 2,000 which compulsory\r\nvaccination reduced to 120? It is difficult to repress some\r\nindignation over such measureless misrepresentation; nor to point\r\nout that we are not dealing with theologians, who are often assumed\r\nto hold a license for prevarication, but with medical officials\r\nwith M.P.’s for spokesmen. The following years, of which Lord\r\nRobert Montagu, speaking in 1867, was necessarily ignorant, gave\r\nthese deaths from smallpox in Scotland--\r\n\r\n    In 1867     100\r\n       1868      15\r\n       1869      64\r\n       1870     114\r\n       1871   1,442\r\n       1872   2,488\r\n\r\nSmallpox was proclaimed “stamped-out” of Scotland in 1870, but the\r\nepidemic of 1871-72 proved how vain was the boast. Smallpox, in\r\ncommon with typhus, may be exterminated, but by no such irrelevance\r\nas vaccination.\r\n\r\nOne object of the bill was the reconstruction of vaccination\r\ndistricts, so as to secure sufficient numbers for arm-to-arm\r\npractice.\r\n\r\n  It is necessary [said Lord R. Montagu] to successful Vaccination\r\n  that the two classes of patients, those who have been vaccinated\r\n  eight days before should meet those who are to be vaccinated, so\r\n  that the doctor may take vaccine from the arms of one set and\r\n  transfer it to those of the other.\r\n\r\nMr. Henley, in opposition, maintained that careful vaccination on\r\nsuch terms was impracticable, saying--\r\n\r\n  It seems a large proportion of the Vaccination provided by the\r\n  public is imperfect; but the bill before us is wholly inadequate\r\n  to secure Vaccination that is trustworthy. If a vaccinator never\r\n  sees a child until it is brought to him, and knows nothing of its\r\n  parentage, how can he judge whether it is fit to be vaccinated,\r\n  or fit to serve for the vaccination of others? No torture will\r\n  induce a mother to confess before company that anything ails her\r\n  baby. Every one who knows anything of women is aware that they\r\n  will conceal in public what they may reveal in the privacy of\r\n  home. The shame of making known her own infirmities, or those of\r\n  her family, will keep a woman silent in a crowd, and if she does\r\n  reply to awkward questions, it will be to mislead. Medical men\r\n  will consequently be perplexed and outwitted; and, therefore, on\r\n  the terms prescribed a safe and efficient system of Vaccination\r\n  cannot be secured.\r\n\r\nFurther, said Mr. Henley, the bill was defective because no attempt\r\nwas made to conciliate the prejudices or consult the convenience of\r\nthe people who were compelled to have their children vaccinated.\r\n\r\n  The bill is one of pure coercion, making no allowance for those\r\n  who are brought under its scope. It must not be forgotten that\r\n  the poor mother is not able to do much within the month after\r\n  her confinement. The period of three months specified within\r\n  which Vaccination must be effected will press very severely upon\r\n  the lower orders. We are told that no district of less than\r\n  5,000 inhabitants will work successfully, and that 10,000 is a\r\n  better number. If country districts are to comprise 5,000, how\r\n  many miles will poor folk have to travel to reach a vaccination\r\n  station? Consider the inconvenience it will be to a woman to drag\r\n  her child two or three miles for vaccination, and be obliged to\r\n  go a second time for inspection! The medical authorities insist\r\n  that four punctures at least ought to be made on the unfortunate\r\n  children. Not only are those four wounds to be inflicted, but the\r\n  children are to be brought in all weathers to have their wounds\r\n  opened and matter extracted for the benefit of others, thus\r\n  prolonging their sufferings and the cares of their mothers. If\r\n  we are to act upon the principle of doing as we should be done\r\n  by, I would ask how you would like to be compelled to carry your\r\n  children to a vaccination station and have them mixed up with all\r\n  and sundry, and inoculated at a hazard with you know not what?\r\n  For myself I see no difficulty in having the children of the poor\r\n  vaccinated at their own homes. It would be far better to pay more\r\n  and work discriminately than let the people think there is one\r\n  law for the rich and another for the poor. If you simply try to\r\n  drive you will find the people apt to kick, and still more ready\r\n  to evade the restrictions you put upon them.\r\n\r\nMr. Kendall confirmed Mr. Henley, saying--\r\n\r\n  As Chairman of a large Union, I have seen great inconvenience\r\n  from the crowding of children at vaccination stations. They\r\n  are taken to those stations whether wet or dry, and cold and\r\n  shivering are kept huddled together in a manner most likely to\r\n  breed illness and diffuse infection.\r\n\r\nMr. Lowe sneered at Mr. Henley’s concern for the poor, reminding\r\nhim that the wounds he deplored would save them from a loathsome\r\ndisease. Mr. Henley did not dispute the salvation, as he might have\r\ndone, but pleaded for its more considerate performance. Spite, too,\r\nof his assumption, there _is_ one law for the rich and another\r\nfor the poor. Compulsory vaccination as applied to the majority\r\nwould never be tolerated by the upper and middle class minority;\r\nnor would a plutocratic Parliament have entertained so profane a\r\nproject. Nor (it must be said) would working men show themselves\r\nmuch more enduring in their own persons. The victims of the law are\r\ntheir wives and children; and it is surprising how much indignity\r\nand cruelty they will endure in these helpless dependents. Mr.\r\nHenley was more chivalrous for them than they are for themselves.\r\n\r\nAn argument for fresh legislation was the failure of the Act of\r\n1853. Mr. Brady said--\r\n\r\n  As a medical man I can testify that medical men are almost\r\n  unanimous in favour of Compulsory Vaccination; but in order\r\n  to give the public the full benefit of the system it must be\r\n  fairly paid for. We shall be penny wise and pound foolish unless\r\n  the persons employed to carry out this measure are liberally\r\n  remunerated. When the bill of 1853 was before the House, I said\r\n  the remuneration was inadequate, and that the Act would be a\r\n  failure, and that prediction has proved true.\r\n\r\nThat the Act of 1853 was a failure, in the sense of not securing\r\nthe vaccination of the people, was untrue--though necessarily true\r\nas concerned the prevention of smallpox. The assertion of failure\r\nin 1867 was an artifice to overcome the apathy of Parliament. It\r\nwas assumed that there was a population to be vaccinated, and\r\nvaccinated in a new and superior fashion, if only better pay were\r\nprovided. More money was wanted to work the Vaccination Mill. In\r\nthe words of Lord Robert Montagu--\r\n\r\n  On the birth of a child being registered, the Registrar is\r\n  bound to give notice to the parent, and to supply him with\r\n  proper forms, whether for public or private Vaccination. He\r\n  will enter in a book the name of the child, with the means of\r\n  identification. After Vaccination, the Public Vaccinator will\r\n  send the certificate of successful Vaccination to the Registrar,\r\n  who will enter it in his book. Thus the Registrar will know which\r\n  children have been registered in his district and which have not;\r\n  which children are liable to Smallpox and which are not liable.\r\n  [_O Credulitas!_] Then it is made the interest of all concerned\r\n  to work the system and enforce its checks. It is the interest of\r\n  every Local Registrar to hunt up every birth, because for every\r\n  entry he has 1s. It is his interest to obtain the certificate of\r\n  successful Vaccination, for entering which he has 3d. It is the\r\n  interest of the Public Vaccinator to operate on as many children\r\n  as possible, because for each successful operation he has at\r\n  least 1s. 6d., and for first class work an extra 1s. It is the\r\n  interest of the parent to have his child vaccinated, for he is\r\n  otherwise subject to legal proceedings and a penalty of 20s.\r\n\r\nColonel Barttelot objected, saying--\r\n\r\n  There are about 750,000 births annually in this country, and\r\n  the parents of the majority surely deserve some consideration.\r\n  250,000 of them can neither read or write, yet they are liable to\r\n  a fine of 20s. if they do not comply with the printed forms of\r\n  this Act. It would be much better to send doctors to the homes\r\n  of the children than collect mothers and infants in crowds at\r\n  vaccination stations.\r\n\r\nMr. Bruce replied that it was proposed to do nothing new--\r\n\r\n  Compulsory Vaccination on the same terms has been the law of the\r\n  land since 1853. The present bill lays down no new principle. It\r\n  merely collects the scattered provisions of the law, and supplies\r\n  machinery found necessary after much experience.\r\n\r\nThe observation was, no doubt, ingenuous on the part of the\r\nspeaker; but, misled himself, he assisted to mislead the House. The\r\nbill, Section 31, ran as follows--\r\n\r\n  _If any Registrar, or any Officer appointed by the Guardians to\r\n  enforce the provisions of this Act, shall give information in\r\n  writing to a Justice of the Peace, that he has reason to believe\r\n  that any child under the age of 14 years, being within the Union\r\n  or Parish for which the informant acts, has not been successfully\r\n  vaccinated, and that he has given notice to the parent or person\r\n  having the custody of such child to procure its being vaccinated,\r\n  and that this notice has been disregarded, the Justice may summon\r\n  such parent or person to appear with the child before him at a\r\n  certain time and place, and upon the appearance, if the Justice\r\n  shall find, after such examination as he shall deem necessary,\r\n  that the child has not been vaccinated, nor has already had the\r\n  Smallpox, he may, if he see fit, make an order under his hand and\r\n  seal directing such child to be vaccinated within a certain time;\r\n  and if, at the expiration of such time, the child shall not have\r\n  been so vaccinated, or shall not be shown to be then unfit to be\r\n  vaccinated, or to be insusceptible of Vaccination, the person\r\n  upon whom such an order shall have been made shall be proceeded\r\n  against summarily, and, unless he can show some reasonable ground\r\n  for his omission to carry the order into effect, shall be liable\r\n  to a penalty not exceeding 20s._\r\n\r\nYet, said Mr. Bruce, it was proposed to do nothing new! Here was a\r\ndevelopment of compulsion subjecting a parent to prosecution during\r\nfourteen years of the life of his child, and it was nothing new!\r\nWhat resulted from this aggravation of the law, devised with craft\r\nand enacted with indifference, remains to be seen.\r\n\r\nThe bill was opposed by Sir J. Clarke Jervoise, Mr. Thomas\r\nChambers, and Mr. Barrow. Mr. Chambers prophesied--\r\n\r\n  I am persuaded that when the bill is passed an agitation will\r\n  commence which will never cease until the Act is repealed.\r\n\r\nThe carelessness and indifference of the House were, however,\r\ninsuperable. It was legislation for “the lower orders,” and\r\nconcerned “respectable folk” not at all. The bill was read a third\r\ntime without opposition, slipped through the Lords unopposed,\r\nand received the Royal assent, 12th August, 1867, as 30 and 31\r\nVICTORIÆ, Cap. 84--_An Act to consolidate and amend the Laws\r\nrelating to Vaccination_.\r\n\r\nAs another example of the advocacy with which this bill was\r\ncommended to the House of Commons, I take the following from the\r\nclose of the speech of Lord Robert Montagu, when introducing it to\r\ncommittee, 14th June, 1867. He said--\r\n\r\n  Smallpox differs from other epidemics in this, that it is one\r\n  of the worst, but is absolutely preventible. In other diseases\r\n  all that can be done by the removal of predisposing conditions\r\n  is to mitigate their virulence; but Smallpox may be altogether\r\n  prevented. If, then, one who raises his hand against another and\r\n  kills him is guilty of murder, of what shall he be guilty who, by\r\n  voice or vote in this House, endeavours to prevent the passing\r\n  of a measure which will make it absolutely certain that Smallpox\r\n  shall no longer kill 7,000 a-year in this country!\r\n\r\nThis absurd adjuration was too much for Mr. Henley, who observed--\r\n\r\n  The somewhat formidable close of the noble Lord’s speech made it\r\n  difficult to know whether I ought not to walk out of the House\r\n  and leave the responsibility of the measure to others. He said\r\n  those who objected to the bill would be guilty of the deaths of\r\n  those who died of Smallpox.\r\n\r\n  Lord ROBERT MONTAGU--I said that Smallpox was so far preventible\r\n  that those who stopped the adoption of Vaccination would be\r\n  guilty of the deaths of 7,000 children a-year.\r\n\r\n  Mr. HENLEY--I understood the noble Lord to say that they would\r\n  incur that guilt if they objected to the machinery of the bill.\r\n\r\n  Lord ROBERT MONTAGU--No; not to its machinery.\r\n\r\n  Mr. HENLEY--Then I do not know precisely what the noble Lord does\r\n  mean.\r\n\r\nIn short, the bill was neither honestly advocated or seriously\r\nconsidered. On the one hand, members of Parliament were prejudiced,\r\nignorant and credulous, and careless as to legislation that did not\r\naffect their families or those of their influential constituents.\r\nOn the other hand there was a knot of medical officials eager\r\nfor power and the aggrandisement of their profession, who did\r\nnot disdain to practise upon the prejudice, the ignorance, and\r\nthe credulity of Parliament. The result was an insufferable\r\noutrage upon the rights of every nonconformist--an outrage which,\r\nif perpetrated on the theological instead of the scientific\r\nconscience, would have roused Englishmen to fever heat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\n\r\nTHE GATHERING MOVEMENT--1867-70.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 31 of the Act of 1867 implied the doom of Vaccination.\r\nIt was bad enough to fine a parent for refusing to vaccinate his\r\nchild; it was, however, a circumscribed annoyance; but to make of\r\nrefusal a continuous offence until a child attained the age of\r\nfourteen was to set up a cause of quarrel that had to be fought\r\nout. Slavery in the United States is abolished, but slavery might\r\nhave endured to this day had the Southerners been more forbearing;\r\nbut, in the arrogance of their power, they imposed on the Union the\r\nFugitive Slave Law, compelling the people of the North to surrender\r\nrunaway negroes. This triumph of the slaveholders determined the\r\nfate of slavery. In like manner the arrogance of the vaccinators\r\novercame their prudence. Resolved to subdue resistance to their\r\nrite, they drove resistance to extremity, and set up an irreducible\r\ninsurrection. As a medical prescription accepted at discretion,\r\nvaccination might have survived unquestioned and paid for; but its\r\ntransition into an aggressive statute removed it from the safe\r\nrealm of professional mystery into the jurisdiction of common\r\nsense, common observation, and every man’s business.\r\n\r\nSec. 31, Act ’67, was quickly turned to account by the medical\r\nofficials who had devised and imposed it upon the indifference of\r\nParliament. They had, of course, to operate through local poor-law\r\nauthorities--a painful necessity; but guardians were occasionally\r\nas fanatical as themselves, and exasperated, too, that their petty\r\nauthority should be set at naught, and especially by parents\r\nin humble life. Consequently, here and there over the country\r\ncontinued prosecutions for refusing to vaccinate were initiated,\r\nstirring up strife, begetting sympathy with the prosecuted, and\r\ngradually converting vaccination into a living political question.\r\nWhatever may be thought of Sec. 31, Act ’67, all will allow that\r\nit drew a line and established irritation and conflict. Opposition\r\nto vaccination had hitherto to contend with nothing so deadly\r\nas apathy, but from that drawback it was now delivered. On the\r\nother hand, in many parishes, Sec. 31, Act ’67 was allowed to\r\nmake no difference. Those who disliked vaccination were warned,\r\nor prosecuted once, and then let alone; but this leniency served\r\nto accentuate the severity practised elsewhere, and to render the\r\nlaw still more odious by reason of the flagrant inequality of its\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nThe scientific opposition to vaccination, initiated by Mr. John\r\nGibbs in 1855, had for some years few accessions, and it required\r\nfaith in truth in full measure to persist in its advocacy. The\r\nJennerian tradition was so rooted in the public mind that to\r\nquestion it savoured of paradox or profanity. There were occasional\r\nmanifestations of scepticism when smallpox attacked the vaccinated,\r\nbut doubt was crushed down as impious and dangerous to established\r\nconfidence. Mr. Herbert Spencer, for example, in _Social Statics,_\r\npublished in 1851, observed--\r\n\r\n  The measures enjoined by the Vaccination Act of 1840 were to have\r\n  exterminated Smallpox; yet the reports of the Registrar-General\r\n  show that deaths from Smallpox have been increasing.\r\n\r\nTo such matter-of-fact criticism, any answer must have taken\r\nform in the style of the bewildered divine, who exclaimed, “Dear\r\nbrethren, what theology can we enjoy if such objections be\r\nentertained!”\r\n\r\nDr. Charles T. Pearce was one of the first to unite with Mr.\r\nGibbs in his labours. As editor of a medical journal, he happened\r\nto receive an article from Mr. Gibbs which set him thinking,\r\nand as the result of his inquiries, he came out an enthusiastic\r\nanti-vaccinator. He made the question of vaccination completely\r\nhis own, and lectured on the subject throughout the country, eager\r\nand ready for combat. In Northampton, in 1860, he held his first\r\npublic debate, and under his influence the town became a centre\r\nof resistance to the compulsory law, so that Mr. Charles Gilpin,\r\nM.P. for the borough, addressing his constituents in 1870, thus\r\nexpressed himself--\r\n\r\n  I have always thought that when we try to enforce one of the\r\n  ever-changing opinions of medical men, we touch upon the\r\n  liberty of the subject and the rights of human nature. I find\r\n  that a number of parents are fined because they are convinced\r\n  that Vaccination is useless and injurious. I ask, What is the\r\n  character of those parents? Are they idle? Are they dissolute?\r\n  Are they drunken? Are they careless of the welfare of their\r\n  children? The answer is emphatically, No! They are thoughtful,\r\n  they are industrious, they are sober. They are men who look into\r\n  the reasons of things, and who decline to be driven into any\r\n  course of conduct which they do not rationally approve. When\r\n  I was in business in the City of London I had my goods seized\r\n  almost every year for Church rates. I objected to the law,\r\n  and with a free heart and a firm voice, I said I will endure\r\n  the penalty. I would not obey a law which I knew to be wrong.\r\n  Therefore it is that I sympathise with those who are persuaded\r\n  that Vaccination is wrong; and for their encouragement and\r\n  consolation let me say, that as compulsory Church rates were\r\n  abolished because of the stedfast testimony borne against them\r\n  by Nonconformists, so will compulsion as applied to Vaccination,\r\n  if resistance is consistently and seriously maintained. As the\r\n  Society of Friends has demonstrated, no law can survive under the\r\n  persistent protest of conscience.\r\n\r\nTenacity was the distinction of Dr. Pearce. Undismayed by whatever\r\nodds, he maintained his position with deliberation and patience,\r\nand by neither historical, statistical, or physiological data was\r\nit possible to circumvent him. When he entered into the controversy\r\nin 1856, fool and fanatic was the summary designation of whoever\r\nventured to dispute the salvation wrought by vaccination; but,\r\nliving until 1883, he witnessed such epithets received with\r\namusement as denoting the ill-humour and impotence of those who\r\nemployed them.\r\n\r\nAn energetic advocate of the good cause appeared in Dr. W. J.\r\nCollins, who, after twenty years of service in London as public\r\nvaccinator, felt compelled to renounce the practice as useless and\r\ninjurious. He stated his conviction frankly and forcibly before\r\nthe St. Pancras Sanitary Committee in 1863,[290] and in an essay,\r\nvigorous with mother-wit, published in 1867,[291] he communicated\r\nmuch useful and unpleasant information to the credulous and\r\ndeceived public. To contend with a judgment thus instructed and\r\nqualified was useless; and those who were affected by the exposure\r\ntook care to avoid it. Nor considering the danger to the craft from\r\ndiscussion, was the policy injudicious. Truth has many adversaries,\r\nbut none so hard to overcome as the non-resistant silence of\r\ntimorous self-interest.\r\n\r\nA leader and organiser of the opposition was wanted, and he\r\nappeared in Richard Butler Gibbs, cousin of John Gibbs, who, as we\r\nhave seen, framed the first systematic indictment of vaccination in\r\n1855. Mr. Gibbs, of Irish parentage, was born in London in 1822,\r\nand in the course of a commercial career became agent at Pease’s\r\nWest Collieries for Joseph Pease of Darlington, the first Quaker\r\nM.P. It was in 1863, when a member of the Bishop Auckland board of\r\nguardians, that he first moved publicly against vaccination, and\r\nthen less against the practice itself than against its prescription\r\nby the authority at that time vested in the Privy Council. He\r\ncautioned his colleagues that they were likely to become (as they\r\nsince have) the tools of a central medical clique. Subsequently\r\nfinding himself comparatively free from business, he devoted\r\nhimself to the cause with which his name has been identified.\r\nGathering together the scattered elements of resistance, he formed\r\nin 1866 the Anti-Compulsory Vaccination League, and travelled over\r\nthe country, lecturing and holding public meetings. The enactment\r\nof repeated penalties for non-vaccination, strenuously resisted\r\nby Mr. Gibbs, established “a raw,” and conferred on the League a\r\ngrievance and purpose everywhere recognised as indisputable by\r\nthe people. Sec. 31, Act ’67 was in a popular sense the making of\r\nthe agitation against vaccination; and it has been maintained (in\r\na sense fortunately) until even the withdrawal of the aggravation\r\ncannot save vaccination itself from ultimate rejection. What at the\r\nmoment we like least, often in the end serves us best.\r\n\r\nMr. Henry Pitman of Manchester entered actively into the movement.\r\nHe had observed the ill effects of vaccination upon one of his own\r\nchildren, and in connection with Mr. R. B. Gibbs organised public\r\nmeetings in Manchester and other places. In 1869 he tried how far\r\na penny journal would succeed, and started _The Anti-Vaccinator_\r\nwhich ran for eighteen weeks. As editor of _The Co-operator_, which\r\nhe conducted for ten years, he gave prominence to vaccination news,\r\nand in 1870 adjoined _Anti-Vaccinator_ to the title, which was\r\ncontinued until _The Co-operative News_ was established in 1871,\r\nwhen he maintained the publication as _The Anti-Vaccinator_ until\r\nthe close of the year. In 1876 Mr. Pitman bore testimony to his\r\nconvictions by going to the Knutsford House of Correction rather\r\nthan pay the fine and costs imposed upon him for refusing to have\r\nhis daughter, Violet, vaccinated, and in _Prison Thoughts_ conveyed\r\nto others the lesson of his experience. Mr. Pitman has been\r\nremarkably successful in impressing public men with his opinions.\r\nCourteous and persistent, he has won consideration where rougher\r\nspeech might not have prevailed.\r\n\r\nProfessor F. W. Newman was led to a knowledge of the dangers of\r\nvaccination by Mr. Henry Pitman; and those who have been observant\r\nof his career in later years know with what courage and consistency\r\nhe has asserted his convictions. Having asked the Professor how he\r\nbecame concerned in the opposition to vaccination, he favoured me\r\nthus--\r\n\r\n“The outline of my mental history in this direction is as follows.\r\nCircumstances had led me to respect Mr. Henry Pitman as a competent\r\nand truthful witness of fact. On a certain occasion he spoke\r\npublicly on the miserable state to which he had seen a poor lad,\r\nIra Connell of Southport, reduced by vaccination. Ira’s parents,\r\nand his brothers and sisters, were all hale: his mother attested\r\nthat previous to vaccination so was Ira. But _after_ vaccination,\r\nIra had never recovered its dreadful effects, three of his four\r\nlimbs being crippled.\r\n\r\n“Some years later, I myself saw Ira Connell at Southport. I think\r\nhis age was then 25, but am not sure. He had only one leg sound,\r\nand hardly one arm. I will not undertake to describe his state\r\nexactly, but it was _very pitiable_. I am happy to add that in nine\r\nor ten years more he has gradually recovered, so as at least not to\r\nbe visibly crippled.\r\n\r\n“Previously I had _refused to read_ anti-vaccination tracts,\r\n_having too much already to read_. I had never _known_ or _heard_\r\nin my own circles of mischief from vaccination, and when some\r\nGerman ladies spoke of its ‘_horrors_’ I thought them absurd and\r\nfanatical; but now that Henry Pitman publicly attested _a fact_,\r\nthis woke me up to the duty of further inquiry.\r\n\r\n“I at once remembered that in my early youth or boyhood I had\r\nbeen staggered by reading in a medical journal that experience\r\nmade it impossible to sustain Jenner’s doctrine that vaccination\r\nwas a certain preventive of smallpox; but the writer nevertheless\r\nurged that it was valuable for making smallpox _milder_ if it did\r\nfollow. This struck me as an ugly shifting of the basis, and far\r\nfrom plausible. One school-and-college fellow of mine, _after\r\nvaccination_, had smallpox that marked him; but nothing further led\r\nme to pursue the argument.\r\n\r\n“I now at once saw that _compulsory_ vaccination was an infamy,\r\nsince Parliament could not secure any one from Ira Connell’s\r\nfate: and I was indignant on learning that doctors pooh-poohed\r\nsuch miseries, as endured ‘_for the general good_,’ a theory\r\nwhich justifies any amount of tyranny under the influence of\r\nsuperstition; and I presently remembered that in Roman pestilences\r\n_sacrifices_ were believed efficacious, and the arguments of the\r\npriests and senators were quite as good as those of our physicians.\r\n\r\n“I find that in 1869 I had a sharp debate with a clever young\r\nstudent of Medicine, who poured out the doctrines of the Faculty,\r\nwhich he had been getting up. My respect for the whole Faculty has\r\nrapidly got less and less; it had long been declining. I need not\r\nobtrude on you the depth to which it has now sunk, excepting always\r\na noble few, who are what Heretics were to the Mediæval Church.\r\n\r\n“Next I saw that no Parliament or King has, or can have, any right\r\n(_on medical theory_) to stick a poisoned lancet into a _healthy_\r\nperson; and that to fancy that Human Health can be improved by\r\naltering the natural blood of Health is _an imbecile contemptible\r\nfancy_. Moreover, that unless Vaccination is believed to _remove\r\nthe causes_ of smallpox, those causes would entail disease in other\r\nways, and perhaps worse, by suppressing _the natural eruption_,\r\nwhich eruption alone is called ‘Smallpox.’ My mind was thus decided.\r\n\r\n“I did not learn till some years later (_what alone concerns\r\nParliament_) that the more active is smallpox, the less is the\r\nTotal Mortality of any year; and conversely, the less active the\r\nsmallpox, the greater is the Total Mortality. This is the only form\r\nof statistics worth attending to. All the rest is dust thrown in\r\nour eyes.\r\n\r\n“Statistics not founded on a scientific principle are the commonest\r\n_nidus_ of fallacy; but if _any_ statistics are to be listened\r\nto, those of Total Mortality are the least open to suspicion. The\r\n_primâ facie_ evidence is, that instead of Vaccination saving\r\nyearly 80,000 lives (Sir Lyon Playfair’s monstrous assertion)\r\nVaccination does only harm; but that Smallpox _saves_ every year\r\nmany lives (some hundreds or thousands) by a natural eruption,\r\nunder the morbid circumstances _desirable_.”\r\n\r\nThe Countess de Noailles contributed most efficient assistance\r\ntoward opening the public mind and letting in light. In a\r\ncommunication her ladyship says--\r\n\r\n“You ask me how it was that my name came to be connected with the\r\npresent anti-vaccination movement.\r\n\r\n“It was in this way. On my return to England in 1865, Mrs.\r\nCowper-Temple, now Lady Mount Temple, asked me to visit the office\r\nof the Ladies’ Sanitary Association, which I had joined her in\r\nstarting four years before. I had wished the Association to be\r\ncalled the Ladies’ Association for the Protection of the Health of\r\nthe Children of the Poor; but that was thought too long a name,\r\nand was changed; and I mention it only to explain what my idea\r\nwas in helping to form the Society. Well, on visiting the office\r\nof the Association, I saw among the sanitary tracts one with the\r\ntitle, _When were you vaccinated?_ On reading the words, it struck\r\nme suddenly that vaccination was all wrong, but as I knew nothing\r\nwhatever about it, and had heard naught but praise of the practice,\r\nI told the excellent secretary of the Association my misgivings\r\non the subject, and she set to work to find out all that was\r\nknown or thought on the question. Miss Griffiths soon learnt that\r\nthree relatives--John, Richard, and George Gibbs--had for twenty\r\nyears been writing and working against vaccination, besides Dr.\r\nCollins and others. Seeing that I was not alone in my conviction,\r\nI resolved to elicit more opinion on the subject by giving a\r\nprize for the best essay on the same, setting forth the supposed\r\nbenefits, dangers, etc. Miss Griffiths went heart and soul into the\r\nquestion, and with the help of Dr. Druitt, I think, she had judges\r\nnamed and the prize of £100 offered. The judges were Mr. Marson,\r\nDr. Richardson, and Dr. Francis Webb--all in favour of vaccination.\r\nThe great length of the essay by Dr. Ballard gave it a claim for\r\nthe prize, and the tremendous because _unavoidable_ admissions as\r\nto the dreadful dangers of vaccination contained in this Prize\r\nEssay, have caused the doctors to try to suppress it--so at least\r\nI have heard.\r\n\r\n“Miss Griffiths sent me in November, 1866, the _Lancet_, containing\r\na horrible account of the poisoning of thirty-six children in\r\nMorbihan, Brittany, by public vaccination.\r\n\r\n“My forebodings being thus so terribly confirmed, I tried to\r\ninterest all the doctors who advised the Ladies’ Sanitary\r\nAssociation in the new difficulties in the way of this dreadful\r\npractice; but the only one who lent an ear to the sad tale was Dr.\r\nGarth Wilkinson, who began mildly, but afterwards waxed valiant in\r\nfight. May he and the little band which his genius has helped to\r\nbring into the field ‘soon put to flight the armies of the aliens.’\r\n\r\n“In 1867 a letter from the Rev. W. Hume-Rothery against compulsory\r\nvaccination struck me, and he set to work at the question in the\r\nco-operative newspapers; and latterly in the _Reporter_, in which\r\nhe has been ably helped by Mrs. Hume-Rothery, the daughter of the\r\nlate Mr. Joseph Hume, M.P. The strength given to the bad law by\r\nLord Robert Montagu’s Act in 1867 roused its enemies at the same\r\ntime; and, feeling that my task was done, I left the contest to\r\nabler hands.\r\n\r\n“I thus found that the Association I had inaugurated in order ‘_to\r\nprotect the health of poor children_,’ was being made into an\r\ninstrument to bind them through their mothers’ ignorance to the\r\nmost wholesale plan for their degeneration, if not destruction,\r\never invented by the mind of man. It was in vain that I tried\r\nto get the ladies of the Sanitary Association to think over the\r\nmatter. I was always met by the remark that it was _a medical\r\nquestion_ and one which _doctors alone could decide_; and all I\r\ncould obtain of them was to allow me to buy up the offending tract\r\nand to remain neutral in the question. When I left the Association\r\na few years after, the tract was circulated again.\r\n\r\n“The compulsory law seems to me well described in these words of\r\nCarlyle:--‘To decree _injustice_ by a _law_--inspired prophets have\r\nlong since seen, what every clear soul may still see, that of all\r\nAnarchies and Devil-worships there is none like this; that this is\r\nthe “throne of iniquity” set up in the name of the Highest, the\r\nhuman apotheosis of Anarchy itself.’”\r\n\r\nDr. Ballard’s essay was of itself a notable achievement. Written in\r\ndefence of vaccination, the difficulties, dangers and futility of\r\nthe practice were so largely revealed, that any thoughtful reader\r\nwas compelled to inquire, Where shall we find compensation for all\r\nthis trouble, these risks, these sufferings? Dr. Ballard’s essay\r\nsoon ran out of print, and the author was judiciously enlisted in\r\nthe medical service of the Local Government Board.\r\n\r\nIn Dr. Garth Wilkinson the movement obtained the assistance not\r\nonly of an able physician, but of one whom Emerson has described as\r\n“a philosophic critic, with a coequal vigour of understanding and\r\nimagination comparable only to Lord Bacon’s;” and “with a rhetoric\r\nlike the armoury of the invincible knights of old.” Having asked\r\nDr. Wilkinson how he came over to the side we identify with sound\r\nscience and sound sense, he answered--\r\n\r\n“The early History of my Opposition to Vaccination is, briefly,\r\nthis--I had not considered Vaccination a question; but practised\r\nit when required. About 1865 the Countess de Noailles assailed my\r\nconscience on the subject, and her earnestness forced me to study\r\nit. She was backed by the late Mrs. Gibbs, then Miss Griffiths.\r\nThrough Miss Griffiths I sent the following message to Madame de\r\nNoailles--‘Tell her Ladyship that the question is comparatively\r\nunimportant. Vaccination is an infinitesimal affair; its reform\r\nwill come in with greater reforms.’ I also wrote to Madame that the\r\nonly short way of getting rid of the Medical vested interest was by\r\npaying half a million or a million of money down to the Profession,\r\nand buying the slaves, the people, out, as the West Indian Blacks\r\nwere bought out.\r\n\r\n“After-studies extending over eighteen years have convinced me that\r\nI was wrong in my estimate of the smallness of the Vaccination\r\nquestion compared with other Evils. As forced upon every British\r\nCradle, I see it as a Monster instead of a Poisonous Midge; a\r\nDevourer of Nations. As a Destroyer of the Honesty and Humanity\r\nof Medicine, which is through it a deeply-degraded Profession. As\r\na Tyrant which is the Parent of a brood of Tyrants, and through\r\nPasteur and his like a Universal Pollution Master. As a Ghoul\r\nwhich sits upon Parliament, and enforces Contamination by Law,\r\nand prepares the way for endless violations of personal liberty\r\nand sound sense at the bidding of cruel experts. Not denying other\r\nforms of Social Wickedness, I now, after careful study, regard\r\nVaccination as one of the greatest and deepest forms, abolishing\r\nthe last hope and resort of races, the new-born soundness of the\r\nHuman Body.”\r\n\r\nThe agitation against compulsory vaccination prospered under\r\nthe leadership of Mr. Gibbs. He sought help on all sides, and\r\nharmonised its various elements to the common purpose of the\r\nLeague. In his various labours he derived efficient assistance\r\nfrom his brother, Mr. G. S. Gibbs of Darlington, who displayed\r\nremarkable ability in the interpretation of vital statistics and\r\nin the exposure of their misapplications. Mr. Gibbs established\r\nbranches of the League wherever there were adversaries of the\r\npractice, and was especially successful in the north of England.\r\nThe relentless application of Sec. 31, Act ’67, in certain parts\r\nof the country did much to rouse public attention and sympathy.\r\nParents were repeatedly fined for persistent refusal to have\r\nchildren vaccinated, and in default of payment had their property\r\nseized, or were committed to prison, sometimes with hard labour.\r\nOccasionally sentences were accompanied with gross insolence from\r\nthe bench. For example, Mr. Bowman having pleaded at Newcastle his\r\nconscientious conviction that vaccination might prove injurious\r\nto his child, whilst it could never save him from smallpox, was\r\ncompared to a thief by the magistrate, who said, “I once knew a\r\nman who had conscientious scruples against working so long as he\r\ncould live by stealing; and I do not think conscience of that\r\nsort is entitled to respect.” Law on such terms naturally invites\r\nexecration, and many who might hold by vaccination are thereby\r\nturned against it.\r\n\r\nBy some it was thought questionable whether Sec. 31, Act ’67, did\r\nafford warrant for repeated prosecutions. Mr. John Candlish, M.P.\r\nfor Sunderland, who sat on the Committee of 1866 which dealt with\r\nthe Bill which became law in 1867, maintained “that it was not\r\nintended that penalties should be repeated, but that one penalty\r\nshould be a discharge from any obligation to submit a child to\r\nvaccination.” It is needless to say, an Act of Parliament is not to\r\nbe interpreted by the intentions of its framers, but by its words.\r\nMoreover, if intentions are brought into question, it would be fair\r\nto set intentions against intentions. Several who were concerned in\r\npromoting the Act of ’67 had intentions more arbitrary than were\r\nconveyed in Sec. 31.\r\n\r\nThe question, was raised by the Rev. H. J. Allen, Primitive\r\nMethodist. He had been repeatedly before the bench at St. Neots,\r\nand was committed to prison for fourteen days, but, having paid\r\nthe fine, £5, was liberated. In less than a month, he was summoned\r\nagain, and fined £1 for each of his children, including costs. An\r\nappeal was made to the Court of Queen’s Bench in 1870, and judgment\r\nconfirmed the severer interpretation of Sec. 31, Act ’67. Lord\r\nChief Justice Cockburn held that a parent having been fined under\r\nthe Act for disobeying an order to have his child vaccinated, may\r\nbe proceeded against from time to time as long as the child remains\r\nunvaccinated. He declined to discuss whether vaccination was\r\ngood or bad; the Legislature had treated it as a matter of great\r\nimportance, and had passed Acts to ensure attention to it; that\r\nbeing so, he could not doubt that the intention of the Legislature\r\nwas not merely to impose a penalty upon a person, once and for all,\r\nfor having omitted to do that which the public health and safety\r\nrequired; but to enforce obedience to the requisitions of the law.\r\nHe thought, therefore, the order to vaccinate might be renewed,\r\nand the penalties might be repeated until the order was obeyed.\r\nMr. Justice Mellor and Mr. Justice Hannen concurred. The judgment\r\nin this case, known as Allen _v._ Worthy, has been repeatedly\r\nquestioned and always reaffirmed.\r\n\r\nImmediately after Mr. Candlish introduced a Bill to the House\r\nof Commons to amend the law, repeating his conviction that the\r\nconstruction put upon the Act of ’67 was never intended by\r\nParliament, and that it was by mere verbal accident that penalties\r\nwere made continuous. The Bill was introduced too late in the\r\nsession (6th July, 1870) to be carried, but it led to discussion\r\nand a promise from Government that the question would be remitted\r\nto a Committee next year, 1871.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[290] _Twenty Years’ Experience of a Public Vaccinator._ Read\r\nbefore the Sanitary Committee of St. Pancras, 9th June, 1863.

Forster moved that a Select\r\nCommittee be appointed to inquire into the operation of the\r\nVaccination Act of 1867, and to report whether such Act should be\r\namended. Mr. Forster’s remarks on the occasion are noteworthy, as\r\nmanifesting the prevalent prejudice. He said--\r\n\r\n  I make the motion in compliance with a promise made to the\r\n  Member for Sunderland last session, who had brought in a Bill\r\n  to relax the punishment for refusal to permit Vaccination. I do\r\n  not imagine that Mr. Candlish, more than any other member of the\r\n  House, has the slightest doubt of the utility and necessity of\r\n  Vaccination, and that it is necessary not only to encourage the\r\n  practice, but to make it compulsory. Opposition to Vaccination is\r\n  not heard in the House of Commons; but it is found, I am sorry\r\n  to say, among certain persons in the country, who have carried\r\n  their resistance to an extent that has been injurious to health\r\n  and destructive to life. [Evolution this from Forster’s fancy.]\r\n  These people must have forgotten the state of the country before\r\n  Vaccination was introduced.\r\n\r\nThen followed the usual fabulous matter of rote--the awful\r\nmortality prior to vaccination, the reduction of that mortality\r\nby vaccination, the extraordinary immunity enjoyed by the\r\nvaccinated and revaccinated, and so forth--uttered and accepted as\r\nindisputable.\r\n\r\n  The Government do not entertain any doubt of the efficacy and\r\n  advantages of Vaccination, nor of the necessity of enforcing\r\n  it. They have to contend with opposition--the opposition of\r\n  ignorance, and also, I am sorry to say, with the opposition\r\n  arising from interested motives [What possibly could they be?]\r\n  preying upon that ignorance; and lastly, with the great neglect\r\n  arising from apathy.\r\n\r\nSir Charles Adderley opposed the appointment of the Committee.\r\nAccepting Mr. Forster’s statement as valid, he demanded--\r\n\r\n  What is there to inquire about? Inquiry that is superfluous may\r\n  be mischievous. Nothing can be more dangerous than to affect\r\n  doubtfulness concerning legislation as to which there is not only\r\n  no doubt, but a call for more rigorous administration.\r\n\r\nApparently the Government were of the same mind as Sir Charles, and\r\nthe Committee was conceded in fulfilment of an inadvertent pledge.\r\nMr. Forster assured the House--\r\n\r\n  The Government do not propose this Committee with the slightest\r\n  doubt about the principle of Vaccination, or the necessity of\r\n  Compulsory Vaccination; and I need not say we have no intention\r\n  of relaxing the operation of the law during the deliberations of\r\n  the Committee.\r\n\r\nThe Committee was nominated as follows on 16th February--\r\n\r\n    Dr. BREWER, Colchester.\r\n    Mr. JACOB BRIGHT, Manchester.\r\n    Mr. JOHN CANDLISH, Sunderland.\r\n    Mr. R. M. CARTER, Leeds.\r\n    Mr. STEPHEN CAVE, Shoreham.\r\n    Sir SMITH CHILD, West Staffordshire.\r\n    Sir DOMINIC CORRIGAN, Dublin.\r\n    Mr. W. E. FORSTER, Bradford.\r\n    Mr. J. T. HIBBERT, Oldham.\r\n    Mr. J. M. HOLT, North-East Lancashire.\r\n    Lord ROBERT MONTAGU, Huntingdonshire.\r\n    Mr. P. H. MUNTZ, Birmingham.\r\n    Dr. LYON PLAYFAIR, Edinburgh University.\r\n    Mr. W. H. SMITH, Westminster.\r\n    Mr. P. A. TAYLOR, Leicester.\r\n\r\nThe first witness examined was Mr. Candlish, himself a member of\r\nthe Committee and promoter of the inquiry. Whilst professing a\r\nlimited faith in vaccination, and willing to exercise a degree\r\nof pressure sufficient to overcome mere apathy, Mr. Candlish\r\nwas strongly opposed to the compulsion of parents who seriously\r\nobjected to vaccination, and especially to their persecution by\r\nrepeated penalties and imprisonment.\r\n\r\nDr. W. J. Collins, the next witness, opened the entire question of\r\nvaccination, and by a variety of experience showed that the vaccine\r\ndisease neither superseded nor mitigated smallpox, whilst it was\r\nfrequently a severe ailment and the means of exciting and conveying\r\nother diseases.\r\n\r\nDr. C. T. Pearce followed suit. The purpose of the Committee\r\n(limited to the consideration of the compulsory law) was apparently\r\nforgotten, and Dr. Pearce delivered a comprehensive discourse, in\r\nwhich the history, claims, failure, fallacies, and disasters of\r\nvaccination were freely displayed; and in the cross-examination\r\nwhich followed made good the positions he had assumed.\r\n\r\nSir Jervoise Clarke Jervoise, Bart., formerly M.P. for South\r\nHants, disputed the common notions of infection as confused with\r\ncontagion, and pointed out that it was absurd to draw comparisons\r\nbetween the vaccinated and unvaccinated unless their pecuniary\r\nstatus were at the same time defined: cases of smallpox in\r\nBelgravia were not to be likened to cases in Clerkenwell. Smallpox\r\nwas not mitigated by vaccination: he had two relatives vaccinated\r\nby Jenner himself who subsequently had confluent smallpox so\r\nseverely that “their own father did not know them.” Nor if smallpox\r\nhad diminished was there any reason to ascribe it to vaccination:\r\nJenner’s cowpox had ceased out of the land, and the cause of its\r\ncessation might equally apply to smallpox.\r\n\r\nDr. Garth Wilkinson gave evidence with the characteristic wisdom of\r\nthe physician of genius who sees with his own eyes. He showed how,\r\nendowed and lucrative, the futility and mischief of vaccination\r\nwere concealed or denied, and how, considered all sufficient\r\nagainst smallpox, the causes of the disease were overlooked, and\r\nthe introduction of improved methods of treatment were unattempted\r\nor discouraged.\r\n\r\nMr. George S. Gibbs contested the right of the State to inflict\r\nvaccination, or to interfere between parent and child. Having a\r\nfaculty for statistics, he had applied himself to the records of\r\nsmallpox before and since the practice of vaccination, at home and\r\nabroad, and showed that smallpox was the same at present as in the\r\npast, neither more mortal nor less mortal, while there was reason\r\nto believe that vaccination was a breeder of smallpox as well as a\r\nsource and excitant of other maladies.\r\n\r\nMr. Aaron Emery related in vigorous English how an infant of his\r\nhad been vaccinated from a healthy-looking child on 31st May,\r\n1869; how erysipelas followed; how it gradually got worse; how\r\n“the little fellow had no rest night nor day from 9th June to 4th\r\nJuly, when death put an end to his sufferings.” Then he told the\r\ndifficulty he had to obtain a true certificate of death from the\r\nvaccinator; how he forced an inquest; how a verdict was returned,\r\n“Died from erysipelas caused by vaccination”; and how its terms\r\nwere subsequently altered by Coroner Lankester and registered as\r\naltered at Somerset House. Up to the time of this fatality, Mr.\r\nEmery had been an unsuspicious believer in vaccination; but his\r\nsorrow led him to acquaintance with numerous cases like his own,\r\nscreened from public recognition, any artifice being accounted\r\nlaudable which seemed necessary to preserve vaccination from\r\nreproach.\r\n\r\nMr. F. Covington, secretary of the Northampton Anti-Vaccination\r\nLeague, described injuries from vaccination in his family and among\r\nhis acquaintance; the distrust and dislike of the practice in\r\nNorthampton with widespread resistance to the compulsory law.\r\n\r\nMrs. E. Kemp brought her baby, and told how it had been vaccinated\r\nwithout examination, although there was a sore on the side of its\r\nhead. As the vaccination began to take, the child’s face and ears\r\nbroke out, until through the mass of eruption “you could only see\r\nits little eyes.”\r\n\r\nMr. Thomas Baker, barrister, had been engaged in the Board of\r\nHealth from 1849 to 1854, and officially connected with several\r\nsanitary inquiries. In his opinion what were called epidemics\r\nwere fevers with a common origin, against which cleanliness was\r\nthe efficient prophylactic, and to which his friend, Dr. Southwood\r\nSmith, held smallpox was equally amenable. As a shareholder in the\r\nMetropolitan Association for the Improvement of the Dwellings of\r\nthe Industrial Classes, he knew that residents in wholesome houses,\r\neven in insanitary neighbourhoods, enjoyed remarkable exemption\r\nfrom epidemic maladies.\r\n\r\nMr. W. J. Addison testified that his perfectly healthy child had\r\nhad syphilis invaccinated, and had died in consequence after\r\nhorrible suffering. The facts of the case were beyond question.\r\nOne hospital doctor had the temerity to ask the mother, “Whether\r\nis it not better for one in a thousand to die like this than have\r\nsmallpox raging about our towns.” “Possibly,” replied the poor\r\nwoman, “but it is strange that my child should be the thousandth.”\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Wm. Hume-Rothery said his attention was first drawn\r\nto vaccination by the operation on his own child, his wife\r\nobserving instinctively, “This is an unnatural and wrong thing.”\r\nInvestigation confirmed his wife’s judgment, and he became an\r\nopen opponent of the practice, writing and lecturing against it.\r\nHis acquaintance with the people in Lancashire had led him to the\r\nconviction that the majority disliked and distrusted vaccination:\r\nthey were coerced to its observance, and evaded it when possible.\r\nHe himself was opposed to vaccination because there was nothing in\r\nnature, human nature, or revelation to justify it. This assertion\r\nof principle over and above practice led to considerable discussion\r\nas to divine law, providence, and the nature of things, and the\r\nright of conscience to withstand corporate dictation.\r\n\r\nMr. R. B. Gibbs, secretary of the Anti-Compulsory Vaccination\r\nLeague, referred to the origin of vaccination, as attested\r\nby Jenner, in the production of cowpox from the contagion of\r\nhorsegrease, and subsequently to the use of horsepox, by which\r\nequination was substituted for vaccination; the diverse virus thus\r\nderived from Jenner continuing in official arm-to-arm currency to\r\nthe present day. What vaccination was had never been determined;\r\nand consequently there had been no proper basis for legislation.\r\nNor had legislation been preceded by impartial and adequate\r\ninquiry: it had been promoted by certain medical men, supported\r\nby the press, and especially by _The Times_, the editors of which\r\njealously suppressed all communications which impugned the efficacy\r\nof the rite. Interrogated as to the amendment of the law, Mr. Gibbs\r\nsaid he had no amendment to propose: the State should withdraw\r\nall assistance from the practice, and leave its use or disuse to\r\nindividual discretion.\r\n\r\nAt this point the evidence of the anti-vaccinists was cut short.\r\nThey had much more to produce, but enough had been heard. The\r\nCommittee had forgotten its purpose, which was not to discuss\r\nvaccination, but, accepting the rite as unquestionable, to consider\r\nwhether the law which enforced it was capable of amendment. Still,\r\nthe mischief being done, it was thought advisable to counteract it;\r\nand forthwith contrary testimony was laid on. Various officials who\r\nfor years had made the promotion of vaccination their business were\r\nsummoned to the rescue, along with certain fashionable physicians,\r\nwhose assurance, it was calculated, would overcome any distrust\r\nthat might be excited in the public mind.\r\n\r\nThe first of the officials was Mr. John Simon, a review of whose\r\n_Papers on Vaccination_ forms Chapter XL. of the present volume.\r\nEvidence from Mr. Simon relative to vaccination was of much the\r\nsame order as that of a Virginian of former days on slavery, or a\r\nthriving London publican on the liquor traffic. Mr. Simon answered\r\nto the demand upon him: he was thorough: there was nothing like\r\nleather--nothing! Smallpox was among the most contagious and most\r\nfatal of pestilences, and “for an overwhelming majority of persons,\r\nwell vaccinated in infancy, vaccination was a security for life\r\nagainst even an attack of smallpox.” The unvaccinated died at\r\nthe rate of 35½ per cent.; the vaccinated in general at 7 per\r\ncent.; and “the properly vaccinated” at from 1 to ½ per cent.--the\r\nfact being concealed that in times when all were unvaccinated,\r\nthe smallpox death-rate ranged from 10 to 18 per cent., the same\r\noverhead death-rate of vaccinated and unvaccinated at this day.\r\nThere had never been, he believed, a case of death from the direct\r\neffect of “properly performed vaccination”--the qualification,\r\nit will be observed, referring all cases of death to something\r\nother than the correct rite. He admitted there was not the least\r\ndoubt that syphilis had been invaccinated on the Continent, but\r\neither from carelessness or culpable intention. Sanitation, he\r\nsaid, had little or no influence on smallpox: vaccination was the\r\nonly protective--which variety of vaccination being judiciously\r\nleft undefined. Smallpox did not displace other fevers during its\r\nprevalence, as alleged by Dr. Pearce. Holding that 97 per cent.\r\nof Londoners were vaccinated, he did not see that the epidemic\r\nthen raging, the severest of the century, disproved the security\r\nasserted for vaccination.\r\n\r\nAs we read Simon’s evidence, we realise afresh the possibilities\r\nof audacity operating on credulity: there is nothing that men,\r\notherwise sane, may not believe when their disposition is set\r\ntoward belief. This Committee sat in London amid a population,\r\nalmost universally vaccinated, suffering from smallpox as they\r\nnever had suffered within living memory; and yet in presence of\r\nsuch a demonstration of the impotence of the vaccine ordinance,\r\nthey listened to the soothsayer with abject acquiescence! Strange\r\nas are the records of witchcraft, there is nothing in them more\r\nmarvellous than this 1871 Committee of select men from the House of\r\nCommons taking for true what under their own eyes was visible as\r\nuntrue--deceived and consenting to be deceived.\r\n\r\nAs for those who disputed the efficacy of vaccination, and\r\njustified their disbelief by smallpox among the vaccinated, Simon’s\r\ncontempt was unqualified--contempt being essential to the success\r\nof the part enacted. “Some of them were ignorant,” he said, “and\r\nothers dishonest.” They were a “league of persons interested in\r\ninterrupting the fulfilment of the law, and very actively engaged\r\nin disseminating falsehoods against vaccination”--falsehoods in its\r\nfavour actively disseminated by Simon and his trade-union being\r\ndisinterested and praiseworthy.\r\n\r\nDr. R. Hall Bakewell, vaccinator-general for Trinidad, was somehow\r\nproduced by mistake, his evidence being in several respects the\r\nreverse of what was wanted. He thought vaccination good, but that\r\n“it should be done in a more careful manner.” It ought not to be\r\ncompulsory, but left to the good sense of the people. Having been\r\nproved to cause death, “it was unjust to oblige a parent to submit\r\nhis child to an operation attended with such risk, however rare.”\r\nReferring to his experience in Trinidad, he said--\r\n\r\n  3557.--I have seen Vaccination produce inflammation of the arm\r\n  and general fever lasting for several days. Such illness was\r\n  often alleged as an excuse by mothers for not bringing their\r\n  children for inspection on the 8th day. At first I was inclined\r\n  to regard the assertion as a mere excuse, but on visiting the\r\n  homes I found the children were really ill, and that it was not\r\n  safe to bring them for inspection.\r\n\r\n  3563.--There is a strong opinion prevalent in Trinidad, and in\r\n  the West Indies generally, that Leprosy has been introduced\r\n  to the system by Vaccination. I found that medical men when\r\n  they had occasion to vaccinate their own children, or those of\r\n  patients in whom they were specially interested, applied to me\r\n  for English lymph in order to avoid the invaccination of Leprosy,\r\n  notwithstanding there was an equal, and probably a greater,\r\n  chance of the English lymph being contaminated with Syphilis. I\r\n  had several cases of Leprosy in which Vaccination seemed the only\r\n  means of accounting for the disease.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of this prevalent opinion, vaccination was\r\nmuch disliked in Trinidad, and, although by law compulsory, was\r\nindifferently enforced, so that at least half the population\r\nescaped unvaccinated.\r\n\r\nInterrogated concerning smallpox in Trinidad, Dr. Bakewell said\r\nthere had been no epidemic for fourteen or fifteen years when one\r\noccurred “frightfully severe, as are all epidemics in Trinidad,\r\nowing to the entire neglect of sanitary precautions”; adding that\r\n“the mortality from smallpox may be greatly diminished by sanitary\r\nmeasures independently of vaccination.” The Doctor still further\r\nruffled the prejudices of the Committee in asserting--\r\n\r\n  3783.--I do not believe that the general mortality of the country\r\n  is at all diminished by the absence of Smallpox. In Trinidad, for\r\n  instance, our mortality is none the less because we have neither\r\n  Smallpox, nor Whooping Cough, nor Scarlet Fever, nor Measles--the\r\n  four most prolific causes of death among young children.\r\n  Nevertheless infant mortality in Port of Spain is double that of\r\n  London. By merely cutting off one disease from the category of\r\n  diseases, you do not lessen the mortality of a country--\r\n\r\nPrecisely what Dr. Watt proved of Glasgow in 1813, and Dr. Farr at\r\na later date confirmed; and what the comparison of the statistics\r\nof mortality in epidemic and non-epidemic years everywhere\r\nillustrates.\r\n\r\nWith the examination of Mr. Danby Palmer Fry, head of the legal\r\ndepartment of the Poor Law Board, the Committee reverted to its\r\nproper function. Questioned as to the state of the law and the\r\ndifficulties connected with its administration, Mr. Fry showed\r\nthat whilst vaccination was nominally compulsory, any resolute\r\nparent might disregard it. To make vaccination really compulsory,\r\nit would be necessary to legislate for its application by force,\r\nwhich legislation public opinion would not tolerate. For himself,\r\nhe thought that parental conviction adverse to vaccination was\r\nentitled to respect, and he therefore suggested--\r\n\r\n  3845.--That it might, perhaps, be worthy of consideration whether\r\n  a man might not be exempted from the penalty who takes an oath\r\n  or makes an affirmation that he has a conscientious objection\r\n  to the vaccination of his child. It seems to me that this would\r\n  be similar in principle to the statutes which prohibited the\r\n  Ecclesiastical Courts from issuing execution against the person\r\n  of a Quaker, though they might do so against his goods, on the\r\n  express ground that the people called Quakers were known to\r\n  entertain conscientious objections to the payment of tithes and\r\n  church rates.\r\n\r\nSir Dominic Corrigan, M.D., a member of the Committee, next gave\r\nevidence, and the defence of vaccination was resumed. So little\r\ndid Sir Dominic apprehend the purpose of the Committee that he\r\nobserved--\r\n\r\n  3992.--I think the great question before us is whether vaccine\r\n  poison can contain within itself syphilitic poison or any other\r\n  poison.\r\n\r\nAs to the invaccination of syphilis, he was clear: it was\r\nimpossible. Vaccination induced no disease. Virus was nothing but\r\npure lymph, even when taken from an impure subject. Vaccination\r\nwas regarded with favour throughout Ireland. It was enforced, but\r\nit required no enforcement: there was no disposition to resist the\r\nlaw. He disliked penalties, and would rather operate by excluding\r\nthe unvaccinated from schools, factories, and public employments,\r\non the ground that “they might become a mine of disease and injure\r\nothers,” namely, to the vaccinated fortified against smallpox!\r\n\r\nSmallpox had been gradually declining in Ireland under the\r\ninfluence of vaccination, and the disease was then, 28th April,\r\n1871, practically extinct. Foolhardy was the assertion. Even while\r\nSir Dominic was testifying, smallpox had reappeared: 665 died of it\r\nin 1871 and 3,248 in 1872. From 1871 to 1875 there perished 5,521\r\nof smallpox in a land from which it was claimed vaccination had\r\nbanished the disease!\r\n\r\nMr. James Furness Marson followed Sir Dominic--a fanatical\r\nvaccinator and promoter of compulsion. For thirty-five years\r\nsurgeon of the Highgate Smallpox Hospital, he had there elaborated\r\nthe whimsical notion that the efficacy of vaccination was measured\r\nby the number and character of the cicatrices; holding that--\r\n\r\n  4149.--A large number of the people in this country are very\r\n  badly vaccinated, having but one cicatrix hardly perceptible, and\r\n  have Smallpox as bad as if they had never been vaccinated at all.\r\n\r\nConfronted by Mr. Jacob Bright with the fact that Dr. Gregory, of\r\nwide experience and admitted authority, had expressed the contrary\r\nopinion in his work on _Eruptive Fevers_, saying--\r\n\r\n  4670.--Hence we may learn how small importance is to be attached\r\n  to the cicatrix as an evidence of the perfection or imperfection\r\n  of the vaccine process. Perfect security is compatible with a\r\n  small and scarcely distinguishable cicatrix or without a large\r\n  wafery cicatrix at all; at least none perceptible five years\r\n  after the operation--\r\n\r\nMarson made answer--\r\n\r\n  Dr. Gregory was an authority; but he was a very singular man\r\n  indeed, and had never investigated the subject in the extensive\r\n  way I have.\r\n\r\nMarson was the victim of a notion, and that a poor one, to which\r\nwhatever stood in opposition was sacrificed. Among his assertions\r\nand admissions, the following are characteristic and illustrative--\r\n\r\n  4151.--If all children were properly vaccinated, the mortality\r\n  from Smallpox would be less than 1 per cent. There are\r\n  difficulties: there is the opposition of mothers to having their\r\n  children well vaccinated.\r\n\r\n  4125.--Persons who catch Smallpox after being vaccinated do not\r\n  generally have it until 18 to 25 years afterwards.\r\n\r\n  4220.--Smallpox itself is a much greater protection from Smallpox\r\n  than Vaccination.\r\n\r\n  4136.--Certainly Smallpox has no tendency to die out: it is\r\n  precisely the same disease it was a thousand years ago, and will\r\n  be a thousand years hence.\r\n\r\n  4148.--We have no control over Smallpox: there is no specific.\r\n  We have no power whatever of controlling Smallpox, Scarlatina,\r\n  Measles, and other febrile eruptive affections.\r\n\r\n  4694.--I look upon hospitals as necessary evils. They are not\r\n  places I would recommend the sick to go to. Anybody who can\r\n  afford to keep in his house should not go to an hospital.\r\n\r\n  4327-28.--Dr. Jenner was wrong when he said Cowpox was derived\r\n  from Horsegrease: it was supposed so at one time, but that is set\r\n  aside now.\r\n\r\n  4325 and 4697.--I have two sources of vaccine lymph; one from the\r\n  inoculation of a cow with Smallpox, and the other from a cow in\r\n  the neighbourhood of Brussels which had Cowpox in the natural way.\r\n\r\n  4646.--There was no epidemic of Smallpox in London from 1796 to\r\n  1825; and as the absence of Smallpox was contemporaneous with the\r\n  introduction of Vaccination, it was imagined that Vaccination had\r\n  a great deal to do with it; and it was a fair conclusion.\r\n\r\n  4705.--Smallpox was raging to a great extent in the east of\r\n  London before the French war broke out--\r\n\r\nYet it is customary to ascribe the Smallpox epidemic of 1870-71 to\r\nthe Franco-German war.\r\n\r\nThe unscrupulous ferocity which animated Marson and his associates\r\ntoward those who impugned their practice is forcibly displayed in\r\nthe following questions and answers; premising that Simon attested\r\nof Marson that “he was a singularly careful observer”--\r\n\r\n  4174.--I suppose you are aware there is a strong feeling and\r\n  a great objection on the part of a number of people against\r\n  Vaccination?\r\n\r\n  Yes, I know there is; but I nearly always find that it is the\r\n  father who objects and not the mother; and it makes it very\r\n  suspicious.\r\n\r\n  4175.--What do you mean?\r\n\r\n  The father would like the family as small as possible that he has\r\n  to work for. I am afraid that is at the bottom of it.\r\n\r\n  4176.--Do you not think that is giving credit to the father for\r\n  looking much further ahead than people in that class of life\r\n  generally do?\r\n\r\n  I do not think they have very far to look when they have their\r\n  daily bread to earn. When the wages come in on Saturday night, it\r\n  pretty often comes to their mind how the money is disposed of--\r\n\r\nA libel as atrocious as absurd, and significant.\r\n\r\nDr. Alexander Wood was brought from Edinburgh to give evidence as\r\nto Scotland of much the same tenor as that of Sir Dominic Corrigan\r\nconcerning Ireland. Dr. Wood’s note was clear--“I do not think,”\r\nhe said, “that a person has a right to keep an unvaccinated child\r\nany more than to keep a mad dog.” Smallpox had been prevalent\r\nin Scotland for some years, and had been made use of to pass a\r\nCompulsory Vaccination Act in 1863; but it was neither shown that\r\nprior to that Act the Scots were unvaccinated, nor that it was\r\nthe unvaccinated who suffered from smallpox--apart from those\r\nconditions of life which make for smallpox. In the course of\r\nnature, smallpox abated in Scotland, and the Act had the credit of\r\nthe abatement: the vaccination of the people being so complete that\r\nDr. Wood testified--\r\n\r\n  4399.--There would not be an unvaccinated child in Scotland if\r\n  we had some means of overtaking the migratory population--the\r\n  railway navvies and tramps, the children born by the roadside and\r\n  under hedges.\r\n\r\nAs in Ireland, there was little or no resistance to the law; and\r\nas in Ireland, it was asserted that smallpox had been stamped out;\r\nbut as in Ireland, the assumption was nullified by experience. In\r\nthe epidemic of 1871-73, there died of smallpox no fewer than 5034\r\nin Vaccinated Scotland--a contradiction unforeseen by Dr. Wood and\r\nthe Committee before whom he prophesied.\r\n\r\nSir William Jenner appeared as court physician. He had advised Her\r\nMajesty the Queen to encourage vaccination in the case of all the\r\nmembers of the Royal Family, and Her Majesty had complied with his\r\nadvice, and the Prince of Wales too. He had had great experience as\r\nphysician to the Children’s Hospital and elsewhere, and had never\r\nseen any serious illness or death result from vaccination. His\r\ntestimony as to the harmlessness of the practice was unqualified,\r\nand he was “unable to conceive of any medical practitioner of\r\nstanding disbelieving in it, or thinking it mischievous”; adding--\r\n\r\n  4521.--I should consider I was very much wanting in my duty, and,\r\n  in fact, deserving of punishment, if I neglected to have my six\r\n  children vaccinated.\r\n\r\nHe approved of the compulsory law, and wished that revaccination\r\nwas likewise compulsory. As to the statistics of smallpox and\r\nvaccination, he disowned sufficient acquaintance; nevertheless he\r\ndid not hesitate to assert that smallpox, as a form of zymotic\r\ndisease displacing other forms, or replaced by others, was “a\r\ntheory utterly without foundation.” Of course testimony of this\r\norder was produced for social rather than scientific ends.\r\n\r\nThe like was true of Dr. Gull, now Sir William. He also professed\r\nto have never seen any serious illness caused by vaccination;\r\nnor did he believe that vaccination from a diseased child would\r\ncommunicate disease. As a defence against smallpox, he held that\r\nvaccination was as protective as smallpox itself. It was the duty\r\nof the Legislature to enforce vaccination; adding--\r\n\r\n  4830.--That with our present knowledge, I should think it the\r\n  most insane thing that any human creature could think of to give\r\n  up Vaccination.\r\n\r\nHe had advised the Government to accept no one for service in India\r\nwithout revaccination. Asked by Mr. Candlish whether he would take\r\na child by force from its parents and vaccinate it, he replied--\r\n\r\n  4854.--I certainly would; just as I would take an ignorant child\r\n  and have it educated.\r\n\r\nLess judicious than Sir William Jenner, Dr. Gull adventured on\r\nstatistics. It having been pointed out that though smallpox was\r\nthen epidemic in London, the death-rate was not raised thereby, he\r\nattributed the result to vaccination. “In former times smallpox\r\nproduced an enormous increase in mortality”--\r\n\r\n  4780.--I think we read of 100,000 people dying of the disease in\r\n  epidemics, and I am not sure that it was not double the number.\r\n  I hardly like to trust myself as to numbers, but when I was a\r\n  professor of medicine at Guy’s Hospital, I brought those numbers\r\n  before my class, and I was astonished at the enormous number of\r\n  deaths in a Smallpox epidemic. I remember that taking all the\r\n  deaths which had occurred in the wars of Napoleon, they were not\r\n  so many by any means as the number of lives which had been saved\r\n  by Vaccination at that time. I do not remember, at the moment,\r\n  the authority for that statement, but I remember that that was\r\n  the kind of evidence that I had to bring before the class.\r\n\r\nVerily the class at Guy’s had romance for science, and the\r\nCommittee had similar entertainment. They were told that except\r\nfor vaccination the epidemic then prevalent in London would result\r\n“in a perfect pestilence”; for mortality among unvaccinated\r\npopulations “had been something terrific.” They had “the history\r\nof smallpox in China and India, where its effects had been\r\nperfectly depopulating.” “To neglect or discourage vaccination in\r\ntheir crowded English towns would be much the same as thrusting\r\na fire-brand into a powder magazine.” Before the introduction of\r\nvaccination, “France lost year after year a quarter of a million\r\nof inhabitants (250,000) by smallpox”; and so forth and so forth;\r\nassertions without warrant outside the intention to excite fear in\r\norder to obtain confidence.\r\n\r\nThe next witness was Dr. Charles West, for twenty years physician\r\nto the Hospital for Children, London, where children under two\r\nyears old were not received--at ages when the immediate effects\r\nof vaccination are obliterated or forgotten. Vaccination, in his\r\nopinion, prevented or mitigated smallpox. “It had, no doubt, the\r\neffect in many cases of developing a disposition to some forms\r\nof skin disease, especially eczema;” but on the whole it was not\r\ninjurious. In the course of his immense experience he had only\r\nknown of one child whose death was due to erysipelas caused by\r\nvaccination. He had no proof of the invaccination of syphilis.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing peculiar about Dr. West’s evidence. It was\r\naccording to professional orthodoxy, from which it would have\r\nrequired more than ordinary courage to depart. Medical men by the\r\ngross could have been put up to deliver similar evidence; but what\r\nwas it worth? The medical mind is fixed in two directions; first,\r\nthat vaccination prevents smallpox, or mitigates it; and second,\r\nthat it induces a harmless disease; a couple of conclusions that it\r\nseems possible to maintain in presence of a vast array of evidence\r\nto the contrary.\r\n\r\nIf any one chooses to assert that vaccination prevents smallpox or\r\nmitigates it, How can he be confuted? The prevented smallpox is\r\nhid in the unknown, likewise the severity that has been mitigated.\r\nAgain, if vaccination be held harmless, any instance of its ill\r\neffects can be resolved into coincidence with a sneer at the vulgar\r\nfallacy of converting _post hoc_ into _propter hoc_. Possessed with\r\nthese notions, nothing is easier than to assert with Dr. Stevens,\r\nfor example, “No man has seen more of vaccination than I have, but\r\nI have yet to see any bad effect from the practice.” None are so\r\nblind as those whose business it is not to see; or as Mr. Aubrey\r\nDe Vere has it, “Prejudice, which sees what it pleases, cannot see\r\nwhat is plain.” It is, I contend, plainly impossible to inflict a\r\ndisease like _Vaccinia_, in any of its varieties, without injury to\r\nthe extent of the disease; without intensifying active or exciting\r\nlatent disease; or without the risk of conveying other inoculable\r\ndisease from the vaccinifer.\r\n\r\n“The great question before the Committee,” said Sir Dominic\r\nCorrigan, “is whether vaccine poison can contain within itself\r\nsyphilitic or any other poison”--the great terror being syphilitic\r\npoison. That question the next witness, Mr. Jonathan Hutchinson,\r\nan expert in syphilis, determined. He had been called to examine\r\nthirteen persons, mostly young adults, engaged in a London shop,\r\nwho had been revaccinated by order of their employer during the\r\nprevalent smallpox panic. The vaccinifer was “a fine, full-grown,\r\nhealthy child,” yet it conveyed syphilis, beyond mistake, to 11 of\r\nthe 13 vaccinated. Mr. Hutchinson allowed that the vaccinator was\r\nnot to be blamed for the disaster, saying--\r\n\r\n  5032.--I very much doubt whether it could have been avoided by\r\n  inspection. The child looked healthy, and it had passed at the\r\n  Vaccine Station as healthy.\r\n\r\nHaving similar cases within his experience, and convinced “that\r\nsyphilis _can_ be communicated in the act of vaccination,” Mr.\r\nHutchinson was asked by Mr. Candlish whether he was aware that the\r\nmedical profession in general denied the possibility, he replied--\r\n\r\n  5060.--I am not aware that the authorities on the subject deny\r\n  it; I believe that several of them hold it very clearly; I am\r\n  aware that the general opinion of the profession is perhaps\r\n  opposed to it, but not the opinion of those who have carefully\r\n  investigated the question.\r\n\r\nTo reduce the effect of testimony so injurious to vaccination, it\r\nwas attempted to make out that the danger was limited to virus\r\ntainted with blood; and although Mr. Hutchinson conceded that blood\r\n_might_ be the medium of transmission, it was undecided.\r\n\r\n  5073.--It is not a subject on which I should like to infer\r\n  anything; I should like to have experiments and facts.\r\n\r\nSubsequent experience has shown that with blood or without blood,\r\nsyphilis may be invaccinated. Still, Mr. Hutchinson, as an advocate\r\nof vaccination, and of its compulsory infliction, “considering it\r\nof the utmost necessity and importance,” conceded that the risk\r\nwas infinitesimal; but (as was remarked at the time) unless the\r\ndiffusion of syphilis were infinitesimal, there was no ground\r\nfor the assumption of an infinitesimal risk. As Mr. Hutchinson\r\nadmitted--\r\n\r\n  5089.--I believe there are cases of latent Syphilis which cannot\r\n  be detected by any medical man, unless he examines into the\r\n  history of the child as well as its appearance.\r\n\r\nMr. James Neighbour, vaccination officer of St. Luke’s, Middlesex,\r\na district of 60,000 inhabitants, chiefly poor, described the\r\noperation of the Vaccination Acts. He met with little resistance\r\nto the law; the births were vaccinated up to the registration\r\npoint, but he had no check on those who might neglect or evade\r\nregistration, or leave or settle in St. Luke’s.\r\n\r\nDr. E. C. Seaton, as select representative of the official vaccine\r\nring, was reserved for the consummation of the inquiry. To review\r\nhis evidence, delivered with much elaboration, would be to repeat\r\nmuch of our story. Vaccination was afresh set forth as “a perfectly\r\nsafe and efficient prophylactic against smallpox, which might be as\r\nreasonably disputed as the demonstrations of Euclid.” Nevertheless,\r\nthe perfectly safe and efficient variety of vaccination was neither\r\ndefined by the witness, nor demanded by the Committee--whether\r\nwith horsegrease cowpox, cowpox, horsepox, or smallpox cowpox;\r\nan omission that illustrates the slovenly and credulous habit of\r\nthose concerned--a 19th century miracle and mystery, being under\r\ndiscussion, and matter and mode being taken for granted under cover\r\nof a word!\r\n\r\nThroughout Seaton’s evidence, smallpox was treated as an isolated\r\ndisease, which might be dealt with specifically and exterminated\r\nwithout reference to other fevers, the common mortality being\r\nreduced to the extent of its reduction: no relation being\r\nrecognised between fever and fever, epidemic and epidemic--\r\n\r\n  5344.--Epidemics of Smallpox, like epidemics of other diseases,\r\n  come and go according to laws which we have not made out. They\r\n  vary in their intensity, and vary in their power of diffusion.\r\n  I have no explanation to offer why the present epidemic (1871)\r\n  should be so much more intense than the epidemic of 1863, any\r\n  more than I can tell why the epidemic of 1863 should have been\r\n  more severe than the subsequent epidemic of 1866-67; or why one\r\n  Cholera or Scarlet Fever epidemic should be so much more fatal\r\n  than another Cholera or Scarlet Fever epidemic--\r\n\r\nYet when explanation was offered, namely, that the febrile disease\r\nof a community is a measure of its sanitary aberrations; that\r\nwhilst the forms of fevers may vary, the activity of one form is\r\nbalanced by the quiescence of others, the tale of death being\r\nequal--the explanation was waved aside; and why? Because it did not\r\nmake for the glory of vaccination!\r\n\r\nCuriously, and for a different reason, Malthus argued, as we now\r\nargue, that if vaccination could exterminate smallpox, not a life\r\nwould be saved--supposing, let us add, no change effected in the\r\nconditions out of which smallpox and cognate maladies arise. Thus\r\nMalthus wrote--\r\n\r\n  I am far from doubting that millions of human beings have been\r\n  destroyed by Smallpox; but were its devastations, as Dr. Haygarth\r\n  supposes, many times greater than the Plague, I should still\r\n  doubt whether the average population of the earth had been\r\n  diminished by them by a single unit. Smallpox is certainly one\r\n  of the channels, and a very broad one, which Nature has opened\r\n  for the last thousand years to keep down population; but had this\r\n  been closed others would have become wider, or new ones would\r\n  have been formed. For my own part I feel not the slightest doubt,\r\n  that, if the introduction of Cowpox should extirpate Smallpox,\r\n  we shall find a very perceptible difference in the increased\r\n  mortality of some other diseases.[292]\r\n\r\nLike Simon and Marson, Seaton had his insult for the opponents\r\nof Smallpox. Simon charged them with ignorance and dishonesty;\r\nand Marson, with the desire to have their families reduced by\r\nsmallpox. Seaton held that they enjoyed martyrdom and courted\r\nimprisonment, in order to get silver watches from their admirers on\r\ntheir release! Here imputation was self-revelation. Seaton had won\r\nplace and pay by his promotion of State vaccination; and absurdly\r\nascribed to his antagonists his own venality. Indeed, his evidence\r\nthroughout was pervaded by the temper and tactics of the quack,\r\nwith an end to promote _per fas et nefas_. Asked what would happen\r\nif compulsion were withdrawn from vaccination, he answered--\r\n\r\n  5510.--Simply an awful increase in the mortality from Smallpox,\r\n  and a considerable increase therefore in the amount of mortality\r\n  in the kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe typical answer of the quack when his dupe hesitates over\r\nhis prescription is, “You’ll see then what will happen!” When\r\nvaccination was not compulsory prior to 1853, nothing “awful”\r\nhappened; it had been compulsory for fourteen years in 1871, and\r\nyet in 1871 the kingdom was under experience of the severest\r\nsmallpox epidemic of the century! Nevertheless, the anticipation\r\nof Malthus was fulfilled: there was no proof that the average\r\nmortality was increased by a single unit.\r\n\r\nThe evidence concluded, a draft report was drawn up by the medical\r\nofficials, submitted to the Committee, and, after some trivial\r\nalterations, agreed to. The character of the report may be\r\nestimated from this its second article--\r\n\r\n  That Cowpox affords, if not an absolute, yet a very great\r\n  protection against an attack of Smallpox; and _an almost absolute\r\n  protection against death from that disease_--\r\n\r\nAnd this in face of the fact that deaths from smallpox among the\r\nvaccinated and revaccinated were recorded by thousands!\r\n\r\nAgainst the evidence in favour of vaccination, the prevalence of\r\nthe present (1871) smallpox epidemic, especially in London, was\r\nalleged, and the awkward circumstance was thus tried to be evaded--\r\n\r\n  Your Committee, however, believe that, on the one hand, if\r\n  Vaccination had not been general, this epidemic might have become\r\n  a pestilence as destructive as Smallpox has often been where the\r\n  population has been unprotected; and that, on the other hand, if\r\n  this preventive had been universal, the epidemic could not have\r\n  approached its present extent.\r\n\r\nThere is no arguing against what might have been. When Sangrado’s\r\npatients died, he averred that if only they had been bled more\r\nand taken more water, they would indisputably have recovered; and\r\nSangrado had believers. So when vaccination does not save from\r\nsmallpox, we are assured, “Ah, but it would, if only there had\r\nbeen more of it.” Descending from fancy to experience,--from what\r\n_might have been_ to what _has been_, there is no record of a worse\r\nepidemic in England than that of 1871-72. The only one to compare\r\nwith it was the epidemic of 1838-40, which occurred when not 50 per\r\ncent. of the English were vaccinated; but they fared no worse than\r\nin 1871-72, when the number of vaccinated was doubled.\r\n\r\nThe proper business of the Committee lay in legislation, and their\r\nreport thereon took this form--\r\n\r\n  There appear to have been several cases of infliction of more\r\n  than one fine or imprisonment in regard to the same child; and\r\n  your Committee, though by no means admitting the right of the\r\n  parent to expose his child or his neighbour’s to the risk of\r\n  Smallpox, must express great doubt whether the object of the law\r\n  is gained by thus continuing a long contest with the convictions\r\n  of the parent.\r\n\r\n  The public opinion of the neighbourhood may sympathise with a\r\n  parent thus prosecuted, and may in consequence be excited against\r\n  the law; and after all, though the parent be fined or imprisoned,\r\n  the child may remain unvaccinated. In such a case the law can\r\n  only triumph by the forcible Vaccination of the child.\r\n\r\n  In enactments of this nature, when the State, in attempting to\r\n  fulfil the duty, finds it necessary to disregard the wish of the\r\n  parent, it is most important to secure the support of public\r\n  opinion; and, as your Committee cannot recommend that a policeman\r\n  should be empowered to take a baby from its mother to the Vaccine\r\n  Station--a measure which could only be justified by an extreme\r\n  necessity, they would recommend that, whenever in any case two\r\n  penalties, or one full penalty (20s.), have been imposed upon a\r\n  parent, the magistrate should not impose any further penalty in\r\n  respect of the same child.\r\n\r\n  It has been suggested that the parent’s declaration of belief\r\n  that Vaccination is injurious might be pleaded against any\r\n  penalty, but your Committee believe that if the law were thus\r\n  changed it would become a dead letter, prosecutions would soon\r\n  cease, and the children of the many apathetic and neglectful\r\n  parents would be left unvaccinated, as well as the children of\r\n  the few opponents of Vaccination.\r\n\r\nThe recommendations of the Committee, chiefly administrative,\r\nwere embodied in a Bill, passed by the House of Commons on 15th\r\nAugust. The tenth clause, limiting penalties, was the subject of a\r\nshort debate, and was carried on a division by 57 to 12. When the\r\nBill was brought before the House of Lords on 18th August, Lord\r\nRedesdale moved to omit clause 10, saying--\r\n\r\n  The clause exempts persons who have been fined the full penalty,\r\n  or two penalties of any amount, from any further proceedings.\r\n  The clause has been hailed with triumph by the opponents of\r\n  Vaccination, who justly think it destroys the whole effect of the\r\n  compulsory law. The poor will naturally argue that, if the rich\r\n  are let off with a fine of 20s., the penalty ought in their case\r\n  to be reduced; and such a resistance to the measure will spring\r\n  up, that the whole purpose of the former Acts will be done away.\r\n\r\nViscount Halifax replied--\r\n\r\n  I hope the House will not strike out the clause, as it might\r\n  entail the loss of the Bill. I admit there are objections to its\r\n  principle; but it has been unanimously recommended by a Committee\r\n  of the House of Commons. Determined opposition has been offered\r\n  to Vaccination by a limited number of persons on grounds which I\r\n  deem unreasonable; but, nevertheless, whilst this feeling exists,\r\n  it is the opinion of Mr. Simon, the medical officer to the Privy\r\n  Council, that it is unwise to insist upon anything which is not\r\n  indispensable; and, further, that the penalty now proposed will\r\n  answer all the practical purposes of the Act. It is desirable\r\n  that public feeling should go with the Act, which will be the\r\n  case, since the exceptions will be very few; whereas an adverse\r\n  feeling may be excited to the prejudice of the Act, if even a\r\n  few prosecutions are persisted in. The strongest advocates of\r\n  Vaccination deprecate repeated fines and imprisonments, which\r\n  leave the defendants’ children unvaccinated.\r\n\r\nLord Redesdale rejoined--\r\n\r\n  I presume the noble Viscount thinks it useless to fine a man\r\n  more than once for drunkenness? The clause surrenders the whole\r\n  principle of Compulsory Vaccination.\r\n\r\nOn the question whether the clause should stand part of the Bill,\r\ntheir Lordships divided:--Contents 7; Non-contents, 8; Majority, 1.\r\nResolved in the negative.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th August the House of Commons considered the Lords’\r\namendment, when Mr. W. E. Forster observed--\r\n\r\n  The House of Lords has struck out of the Bill the 10th Clause,\r\n  the important clause which mitigates penalties. That clause was\r\n  passed in this House by a majority of 57 to 12, and expunged in\r\n  the other House by a majority of 8 to 7, the total number of\r\n  peers voting being just equal to the number of members of the\r\n  Select Committee which, after long and careful consideration,\r\n  came to a unanimous conclusion in favour of the clause. I\r\n  should have no hesitation in asking the House to disagree to\r\n  the amendment, if the period of the session would allow of such\r\n  disagreement being made without loss of the Bill; but as that\r\n  is not the case, and as such a course may involve the loss of\r\n  the Bill, which effects several great improvements, I fear the\r\n  House has no choice, and must accept the amendment. Although the\r\n  clause is doubtless an important one, I may remark it is not\r\n  necessary to other parts of the Bill, and, with Smallpox raging\r\n  in the country as it is, I think it will not be safe to postpone\r\n  the measure. I regret the omission of the clause, because in my\r\n  opinion it strikes a heavy blow at the principle of Compulsory\r\n  Vaccination, which their Lordships, as well as I, think necessary\r\n  for the health of the country. I move that the House agree to the\r\n  Lords’ amendment.\r\n\r\nMr. M‘Laren said--\r\n\r\n  Whilst I concur in the course proposed, I hope the Government may\r\n  lose no time in bringing in a Bill to enact the clause that is\r\n  dropped.\r\n\r\nThe motion was agreed to, and repeated penalties continue to this\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[292] _Essay on the Principle of Population._ 2nd Ed. London, 1803.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\n\r\nTHE STRUGGLE FOR FREEDOM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe temper and conduct of Parliament satisfied Mr. Gibbs and his\r\nassociates that they must turn again to the people and achieve\r\nsuccess through their instruction, enlightenment and fears. At this\r\njuncture, however, the labours of Mr. Gibbs terminated. He had\r\nmarried Miss Griffiths (for many years secretary of the Ladies’\r\nSanitary Association), and had gone with her on a tour through\r\nthe United Kingdom, holding meetings and discussing the evidence\r\nand report of the House of Commons Committee. His last public\r\nappearance was at Cork; proceeding thence to Dublin, he died there\r\nafter a short illness on 1st December, 1871.\r\n\r\nThe removal of Mr. Gibbs was a severe discouragement; but a good\r\ncause may always be trusted to evolve its own prophets. Mrs. Gibbs,\r\nas became a wise woman, felt that she could not better honour her\r\nhusband than by consecrating herself to his work. She formed the\r\nMother’s Anti-Compulsory Vaccination League; and until her own\r\ndeath, 10th November, 1878, devoted her training, experience and\r\nintelligence to awakening an interest in those divine laws of life\r\nof which a practice like vaccination is a deliberate negation.\r\n\r\nIn 1872 Mr. John Pickering, of Leeds, in conjunction with Mr.\r\nHenry Pitman, started the _The Anti-Vaccinator_ fortnightly, and\r\ncontinued it for a year. To maintain such a journal is far from\r\neasy. As Napoleon III. observed to Cobden, “There are a good many\r\nfree-traders in France, but you must remember that the people\r\nare not organised, whilst the trades which prey upon the people\r\nare organised and are always alert.” To overthrow the trade in\r\nvaccination, established, endowed and enforced, is to encounter\r\nthe enmity and opposition of the organised profession at whose\r\ninstigation and for whose advantage vaccination was established,\r\nendowed and enforced; and to effect the overthrow, it is necessary\r\nto raise up a countervailing force among a public apathetic,\r\nignorant, and credulous as to medical mysteries. The overthrow\r\nmight be thought hopeless were it not for the leverage afforded by\r\nthe compulsory law. Every parent who has wisdom and love enough\r\nto refuse to have his child vaccinated, is enabled to bear his\r\ntestimony in court, to have it certified by fine or imprisonment,\r\nand to have his triumph published for encouragement and repetition.\r\nThere is no preaching like such practice, for which the evil law\r\nitself provides opportunity.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickering was fined over and over again, and in his\r\n_Anti-Vaccinator_ he proved abundantly that he had reason and\r\nscience without end for his steadfast resistance to the legalised\r\nsuperstition. In 1876 he was enabled to strike a blow for the\r\ntruth not likely to be forgotten, especially in Yorkshire. The\r\nstatistics of the Leeds Smallpox Hospital had been published after\r\nthe fashion of similar concoctions--an insignificant mortality\r\namong the vaccinated being set against a prodigious mortality among\r\nthe unvaccinated. The statistics were denounced as fictitious, and\r\nproof of the accusation being demanded, Mr. Pickering produced the\r\nproof.[293] The requisite inquiry was tedious and difficult; and\r\nbecause tedious and difficult it was presumed it would never be\r\nattempted, and that impunity was assured. The exposure demonstrated\r\nafresh how little dependence is to be placed on the collocation\r\nof figures by those whose pride and interest are committed to a\r\nforegone conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe severity of the compulsory law is subject to frequent abatement\r\nin its administration by poor law guardians. They appoint and\r\npay vaccination officers, and it is for them to consider and, to\r\nsanction repeated prosecutions. Hence a majority, or an energetic\r\nminority of guardians adverse to vaccination may do much to\r\nfrustrate its public administration. What is practicable in this\r\nway was shown by the Keighley guardians in 1876. They declined to\r\nprosecute; they disregarded the admonitions of the Local Government\r\nBoard; and they refused to obey a mandamus issued from the Queen’s\r\nBench. They were thereon arrested for contempt of court, and\r\ncommitted to York Castle, from which they were released after\r\nnominal submission. They were re-elected by the ratepayers, and did\r\nas before, but more discreetly.\r\n\r\nThere is a proverb about taking a horse to the water and trying to\r\nmake him drink, which applies to legislation when equally disliked\r\nby those expected to enforce it and by those on whom it is to be\r\nenforced. Under such conditions the compulsory act is of no effect\r\nin Keighley: those who like may be vaccinated, and those who do\r\nnot, need not. The majority are unvaccinated and nowhere is\r\nsmallpox less feared. In several towns where public sentiment is\r\nsimilarly enlightened, something of the same freedom is enjoyed. In\r\nmany parishes it is the rule to disallow repeated prosecutions: the\r\nvaccination officer fulfils his commission in prosecuting once, and\r\nthen his hand is stayed. In some parishes those who are known to be\r\nopposed to vaccination are passed over on the tacit understanding\r\nthat they keep quiet as to their indulgence; a course of procedure\r\nextremely injurious to the good cause, damping enthusiasm and\r\nsuppressing that conflict and agitation by which it prospers.\r\nIn other parishes no quarter is allowed: the law is worked with\r\nrigour. Prosecution follows prosecution until either fury exhausts\r\nitself, or the nonconformist is driven elsewhere.\r\n\r\nSuch persistent prosecution often becomes a public scandal. To a\r\nparent with adequate means, the fines and costs are trivial, and\r\nare amply repaid by the satisfaction of setting guardians and\r\njustices at defiance, and publishing far and wide his contempt for\r\nthe vaccine superstition. On the other hand, a parent in humble\r\ncircumstances is often put to cruel straits between his love and\r\nduty to his child and the comfort of conformity.\r\n\r\nIn the difficulty thus created by the law, the Local Government\r\nBoard is frequently appealed to for advice; and in 1876 the Board,\r\nat that time under the presidency of Mr. Sclater-Booth, addressed\r\na letter of counsel to the Evesham guardians, which, translated\r\nfrom official circumlocution, came to this--Prosecute until you\r\nare satisfied your antagonist cannot be overcome: then consider\r\nwhether you had not better desist; for he may obtain sympathy, and\r\nthe law and the rite alike suffer discredit in public estimation.\r\nIn Cowper’s words, “Safe policy, but hateful.” This Evesham letter\r\nhas become a standard document, and is regularly posted by the\r\nBoard to guardians in perplexity as to the extent of vengeance\r\nthey should execute. Such is the variety of valour taught from\r\nWhitehall--“Fight until you discover you are not likely to prevail;\r\nand take care to leave off before you make yourselves hateful or\r\nridiculous.” Law was never, perhaps, reduced to baser terms.\r\n\r\nSeveral attempts have been made to modify the law as recommended\r\nby the Vaccination Committee of 1871 and approved by the House of\r\nCommons. Mr. Pease (now Sir Joseph) introduced a bill with that\r\npurpose in 1872 and 1878, limiting the penalty in any case to 20s.,\r\nbut without success. In 1880 the Gladstone administration, fresh\r\nfrom the country, and flushed with good intentions, brought forward\r\na similar bill, but dropped it in abject fright in consequence of\r\nthe clamour of the medical trade unions, who fancied their vested\r\ninterest in vaccination endangered. Nevertheless, those responsible\r\nfor the law at the Local Government Board avow their disapprobation\r\nof repeated prosecutions, and regret that Parliament does not\r\nappear to be of a like mind, reckless of the fact that Parliament\r\nis rarely unwilling to consent to an administrative change when\r\nthose in authority state the reasons for it, and insist on the\r\nnecessity of giving them effect.\r\n\r\nMr. Forster, when moving for the Committee of 1871 in the House of\r\nCommons, spoke as if no member was prepared to dispute the efficacy\r\nof vaccination against smallpox; and, though the assumption was\r\nexcessive, it was not far from correct. Even Mr. Candlish only\r\nobjected to the injustice of compulsion. Since then considerable\r\nprogress has been made. Mr. P. A. Taylor, who shared the position\r\nof Mr. Candlish, subsequently examined the history and evidences of\r\nvaccination for himself, with the inevitable result: he discovered\r\nthat he had been imposed upon, and having made sure, straightway\r\nbegan to make known his discovery to others. Mr. C. H. Hopwood,\r\nequally enlightened, moved Parliament for various statistical\r\nreturns which exhibited the influence of enforced vaccination, in\r\nauthentic form and on a national scale, as a factor of death and a\r\ncommunicator and aggravator of other maladies. In conjunction, Mr.\r\nTaylor and Mr. Hopwood have raised the standard of resistance to\r\nvaccination in the House of Commons; and what Mr. Forster in 1871\r\nset forth as indisputable, is now openly and unanswerably disputed;\r\nfor those who have come to the defence, like Sir Lyon Playfair\r\nand Sir Charles Dilke, have been convicted of unquestionable\r\nmis-statements which could only pass muster as addressed to\r\nuncritical credulity.\r\n\r\nParliament is the creature of public opinion, and to arouse and\r\ninform that opinion and to bring it to fruit in legislation, it\r\nis necessary to agitate and to organise. Consequent on the death\r\nof Mr. R. B. Gibbs in 1871, the League, of which he was leader,\r\nunderwent a course of vicissitude until, in 1876, it was revived\r\nunder the presidency of Mr. William Hume-Rothery, with the\r\n_National Anti-Compulsory Vaccination Reporter_ for its organ,\r\nedited by Mrs. Hume-Rothery. The energy and ability which Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Hume-Rothery have brought to their arduous enterprise\r\nhave been unwearied and conspicuous--their self-consecration has\r\nbeen unreserved. Sometimes they have been charged with vehemence\r\nand intolerance, but when we consider the craft with which they\r\nare confronted on one side, and the credulity on the other, the\r\nmisery and mortality resulting from the cruel practice, and the\r\nmonstrous oppression exercised on those who resist the despicable\r\nsuperstition, it is not easy to be calm, or to adjust invective\r\nto a scruple. “Thou shouldst not speak so strongly, John,” said a\r\nFriend to her husband, when denouncing some iniquity. “Ah! Jane,”\r\nhe replied, “thou knowest not what I keep back.”\r\n\r\nIt is frequently said that anti-vaccinators are fanatical, which\r\nmay be more or less true; but if in quest of fanaticism, where\r\nshall we find it so ruthless, so untruthful, or so mercenary as\r\namong vaccinators? Take for example, Jenner, or Ring, or Seaton, or\r\nMarson, or Simon. The fury of anti-vaccinators stands excused by\r\nthe strongest reason that can justify or ennoble fury. If a father\r\nhas a child injured or killed by vaccination, and is threatened (as\r\nis often the case) with a second attack on his family life, with\r\nwhat temper may he be expected to regard the law? When Macduff’s\r\nchildren were slaughtered, it was only in Macbeth’s blood that he\r\ncould ease his soul, and with Macduff goes the sympathy of every\r\nhuman heart. So it is with those bereaved by vaccination; only for\r\nthem there is no personal Macbeth to receive his deserts, but a\r\nbodiless law.\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to philosophise over other people’s wrongs,\r\nor advise forbearance where there is no sense of hurt; but fury\r\nand indignation constitute the natural reaction against outrage\r\nand injustice, and where feeble or absent denote defective moral\r\nsensibility. Nevertheless, fury and indignation are poorly spent\r\nif allowed to exhaust themselves in vituperation. Their proper use\r\nis to give vigour to action, and, invested in prudence, to achieve\r\nswift and sure redemption. Wise is the advice--\r\n\r\n      “Prune thou thy words, the thoughts control\r\n        That o’er thee swell and throng:\r\n      They will condense within thy soul,\r\n        And change to purpose strong.”\r\n\r\nThe National League holds an annual conference in some convenient\r\ncentre, to which representatives from affiliated societies are\r\nappointed. Many of these societies co-operate for the defence of\r\ntheir members under prosecution; they organise public meetings and\r\ndiscussions; provide lectures; distribute tracts; bring to light\r\nvaccination disasters; frustrate the attempts of medical men to\r\nget up smallpox panics; and, in short, to do all in their power to\r\nturn confidence aside from a magical, misleading and mischievous\r\nprescription to trust in the common conditions of health, as\r\nverified by science and continual experience.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that these societies excite much annoyance\r\nand evoke much bad language from the practitioners whose craft\r\nthey discredit and despoil. Thus, for example, the British Medical\r\nAssociation, in a petition addressed to Government in 1879,\r\nprotesting against any relaxation of the compulsory law, and signed\r\nby several thousand members of the profession, gave voice to the\r\ntrade grievance--\r\n\r\n  The outcry against Compulsory Vaccination is mainly due to\r\n  certain interested persons [_interested in what?_] who, by\r\n  the dissemination of inflammatory literature and distorted\r\n  statements, stir up opposition to Vaccination on the part of\r\n  ignorant and thoughtless people.\r\n\r\nHere what is wished to be taken for true is set forth as fact.\r\nWhatever the opponents of vaccination may be, they are neither\r\nignorant or thoughtless, nor do they influence the ignorant and\r\nthoughtless. On the contrary, it is their exact acquaintance\r\nwith the history and theories, the inutility and dangers of the\r\nmultiform rite, designated vaccination, which renders them such\r\ndangerous and disagreeable antagonists. Further be it said,\r\ncompulsory acquaintance with vaccination has been for thousands an\r\nintroduction to vigorous intellectual life. It has demonstrated\r\nthe fallibility of authority, and how it is possible for what is\r\naccounted established beyond dispute to be false to the core.\r\nCertain it is that ere long vaccination will be ranked among the\r\ncrassest of human follies, and what force that exposure will lend\r\nto scepticism in conflict with other forms of conventional opinion,\r\nmay be left to the consideration of the judicious reader.\r\n\r\nThe London Society for the Abolition of Compulsory Vaccination was\r\nformed in 1880 with objects thus defined--\r\n\r\n  1.--The Abolition of Compulsory Vaccination.\r\n\r\n  2.--The Diffusion of Knowledge concerning Vaccination.\r\n\r\n  3.--The Maintenance of an Office in London for the Publication of\r\n  Literature relating to Vaccination, and as a Centre of Action and\r\n  Information.\r\n\r\nAn office was opened in Victoria Street, Westminster, with Mr.\r\nWilliam Young, as secretary, and _The Vaccination Inquirer_,\r\nestablished by Mr. William Tebb in 1879, was adopted as the organ\r\nof the Society. The executive committee, liberally assisted by the\r\nCountess de Noailles, Mr. P. A. Taylor, Mr. Tebb, and others, have\r\nbeen enabled to make many and visible marks on public opinion,\r\nwhich by all means possible they are ever intent to repeat. Mr.\r\nJ. G. Talbot, M.P. for Oxford University, took early opportunity\r\nto stigmatise the London Society as a Murder League, and Dr.\r\nBarrow, president of the British Medical Association in 1881, as “a\r\nDisgrace to Humanity”--these and similar amenities being taken as\r\nbadges of honour and tokens of success. The London Society has also\r\nactively co-operated in successive International Anti-Vaccination\r\nCongresses--at Paris in 1880, at Cologne in 1881, and at Berne in\r\n1883.\r\n\r\nOf late years the literature of anti-vaccination has been steadily\r\nincreasing in volume, variety and power. A notable effort to\r\nbring the question within range of common apprehension was the\r\npublication in 1876 of _Our Medicine Men_, by Mr. H. Strickland\r\nConstable. Apart from vaccination, _Our Medicine Men_ is a pleasant\r\nbook, full of anecdote, good humour, shrewdness and excellent\r\nphilosophy, not likely to be forgotten by those who make its\r\nacquaintance.[294]\r\n\r\nA series of _Vaccination Tracts_,[295] fourteen in number, was\r\ncommenced by Mr. Wm. Young in 1877 and completed by Dr. Garth\r\nWilkinson in 1879. Fuseli, reproaching his contemporaries for\r\ntheir indifference to Flaxman, said, “You English, you see\r\nwith your ears”; and Fuseli’s observation recurs as we think\r\nof the limited repute of Dr. Wilkinson; not that any more than\r\nFlaxman he is unknown, but because he is so _inadequately_\r\nknown, probably because he is so frequently at variance with\r\nthe fashionable science of the day, nor has paid court to its\r\nfashionable professors. Nevertheless, those who have sense and\r\ncourage to recognise what is admirable without direction find in\r\nthese _Tracts_ not only vaccination made an end of, but thoughts\r\nnew and deep, with felicities of diction and cadence that every\r\nconnoisseur in words must appreciate and revert to with delight.\r\nHowever wide our acquaintance with English literature, a variety\r\nof singular affluence and originality remains until Dr. Garth\r\nWilkinson has been discovered.\r\n\r\nIt is a mistake to suppose that all medical men believe in\r\nvaccination in one or any of its varieties. Those who use their\r\neyes and are not bewitched by prescription or self-interest,\r\nrecognise the failure and disasters of the practice, but may not\r\ncare to set themselves at open variance with their profession. Many\r\nprivately confess their vanishing or vanished faith in the rite,\r\nadding, perhaps, that its dangers are exaggerated, and that it does\r\nlittle harm with due precaution, whilst affording a comfortable\r\nsense of security to its recipients. Others go further, and wish\r\nthe discredit of compulsion were removed from the practice, when\r\nthey would leave it to their patients to decide for themselves\r\nto vaccinate or not to vaccinate, they disowning responsibility.\r\nA nobler few decline to hold any terms of compromise with the\r\nimposture, and among these Mr. Enoch Robinson is conspicuous. He\r\nhas lectured and debated against vaccination, and by his temperate\r\nand competent advocacy has made converts of the most unwilling\r\nand prejudiced. Moved by a popular compilation in defence of\r\nvaccination, he published a reply to it in 1880, entitled, _Can\r\nDisease protect Health?_[296]--a polemic cogent and perspicuous,\r\nand ingenuous as its opposite was the reverse. As illustrative\r\nof the character of the medical press, it may be mentioned that\r\nadvertisements of Mr. Robinson’s pamphlet were declined by _The\r\nLancet_ and _The British Medical Journal_, it being their rule\r\nto exclude announcements injurious to the interests involved in\r\nvaccination--surely in such quarters a superfluous precaution.\r\nSome people appear to fancy that intolerance is a peculium of\r\ntheologians; but they would find abundant cause for a different\r\nopinion if familiar with the medical world.\r\n\r\nIt is said that inasmuch as the rising generation of medical men\r\nare more roundly educated than their predecessors, they are likely\r\nto deal with vaccination in a more scientific and independent\r\nspirit. The experience of Dr. W. J. Collins at St. Bartholomew’s\r\nHospital lends reason to the anticipation. Study and observation\r\nconfirmed Dr. Collins in his father’s practical judgment, which\r\nhe has re-stated firmly and temperately on proper occasions;\r\nsupporting it with the wide and open evidence at his command. He\r\nhas been heard with patience and favour, nor has he encountered any\r\nbut honourable opposition; proving how much depends on the manner\r\nin which a man fights his battle, and how much is conceded to\r\ncourage with courtesy. Dr. Collins has argued, “Ought Vaccination\r\nto be enforced?” before the Abernethian Society; he has met Dr. W.\r\nB. Carpenter in public debate; he has discussed the Vaccination\r\nDisaster at Norwich in 1882; he has answered Sir Lyon Playfair; and\r\nhe has brought the doctrine of evolution to bear on the generation\r\nof disease.[297] If sometimes we refer to the medical profession\r\nwith severity, the recollection of members like Dr. Collins\r\noperates as a check. Still we must be just. Professions, like\r\nkindred trade unions, are controlled by their interests, and there\r\nnever was church, or community, or corporation which surrendered\r\nany source of gain, save by external compulsion. Public vaccination\r\nin England represents a medical endowment of £100,000 annually,\r\nwhich the profession, true to the law of its being, cannot renounce\r\nvoluntarily; and there is no sense in shutting our eyes to that\r\ncertainty. Of course, it would be absurd to charge medical men\r\nindividually with defending vaccination because of the gain\r\nattached thereto: nothing of the kind is intended: but as Hobbes\r\nobserved of mankind in the gross, “Even the axioms of geometry\r\nwould be disputed if their interests were peculiarly affected by\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, it is said that vaccination is a medical question\r\nwhich may be left to medical men to settle, the answer is--“Nay:\r\nvaccination is paid for out of the public pocket, and whatever the\r\nevidence adverse to its usefulness, it will be upheld as beneficial\r\nby those who profit by it. If those who pay do not object, those\r\nwho are paid never will. In face of common experience, we hold it\r\ncannot be otherwise.”\r\n\r\nThere are fashions in medicine as in millinery: they are started;\r\nthey flourish; they pass away; but the permanence of any medical\r\nfashion might be secured if fortified by endowment. Venesection\r\nwas once in vogue; now it is scarcely known; but if in its heyday\r\na law had been passed for its performance at the public expense,\r\na ring of official venesectors would have been created to justify\r\nthe practice against all gainsayers; to deny or explain away every\r\ndisaster and fatality; and at all hazards preserve its credit from\r\nreproach; whilst it would cost something like a constitutional\r\nstruggle for the nation to escape from the imposition. It is thus\r\nwith vaccination. Left to itself, it would, like venesection, have\r\ndropped into disuse; but it acquired permanence from the initial\r\nerror--the endowment of the National Vaccine Establishment in 1808.\r\n\r\nThe enforcement of vaccination supplies a yet stronger reason\r\nfor public interference. A church endowed by the State might be\r\nendured by Dissenters, but if submission to any of its offices were\r\nmade compulsory, endurance would give place to active resistance.\r\nSuch is the case with vaccination. As it is endowed and enforced,\r\nit is hopeless to try to reserve it from general discussion and\r\ndenunciation. Since citizens are liable to fine and imprisonment\r\nwho withhold their children from the lancet, it becomes their duty\r\nto satisfy themselves as to the character of the operation for\r\nwhich they are taxed, and with which their families are menaced;\r\nand should their convictions be adverse to its utility and safety,\r\nthey cannot do their fellow-citizens better service than by bearing\r\nthe testimony of open resistance.\r\n\r\nThus vaccination is translated to politics and made every man’s\r\nbusiness; whilst the interest created by its endowment and\r\nenforcement deprives its medical advocates of judicial authority in\r\nthe controversy. It would be as reasonable to expect slaveholders\r\nto denounce slavery, or protected manufacturers to advocate free\r\ntrade as for those whose professional prestige and advantage are\r\ninvolved in the practice to speak the truth about vaccination.\r\nLet us be reasonable. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of\r\nthistles? We should not require of average human nature the virtue\r\nof its rarer forms. Like all monopolies, vaccination endowed and\r\nenforced, is defended with unanimity from within, and must be\r\nattacked and overthrown from without--nevertheless be it said with\r\n_some_ assistance from within, and that assistance most efficient.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore no cause for surprise that a large share in the\r\nagitation against compulsory vaccination has fallen to laymen. Mr.\r\nGeorge S. Gibbs (cousin of John Gibbs and brother of R. B. Gibbs)\r\nhas for thirty years maintained a criticism, chiefly statistical,\r\nof the official defences of vaccination, characterised throughout\r\nby an accuracy which has never been impugned.[298]\r\n\r\nMr. H. D. Dudgeon has been described as “a veritable and venerable\r\napostle of health.” With a consummate knowledge of hygiene, and a\r\nprofound faith in its power to overcome zymotic disease, he has\r\nset forth its principles with such lucidity and persistency that\r\nhe has gone far to educate Leicester in setting at naught the\r\nvaccine superstition. To the standard assertion of the vaccinators,\r\nthat sanitation is good against all febrile affections, except\r\nsmallpox, for which there is no preventive save vaccination (the\r\nsovereign variety being conveniently undefined) he has been an\r\nopponent merciless as truth. Regret is frequently expressed that\r\nthe abundant information and admirable sense which pervade Mr.\r\nDudgeon’s writing have been confined to newspapers and occasional\r\npamphlets, but it is probable his teaching has been all the more\r\nfruitful because adapted to immediate circumstances.[299] The word\r\nspoken in due season how good it is!\r\n\r\nThe name of Mr. Alexander Wheeler of Darlington is familiar\r\nwherever vaccination is brought under discussion. Mr. Wheeler’s\r\ninterest in the subject was first excited, he writes, by Mr. G. S.\r\nGibbs, “whose scepticism as to its virtue seemed to me absurd”--\r\n\r\n  Mr. Gibbs inquired whether I had examined the question, and when\r\n  I confessed that I had not, he asked if I would read Baron’s\r\n  _Life of Dr. Jenner_. Nothing loath, I accepted the loan of the\r\n  volumes. Doubts began to trouble me with the first volume, and\r\n  the second quite upset my confidence in Vaccination as a positive\r\n  preventive of Smallpox. I then set to work to ascertain with\r\n  what care I could, whether there was any truth in the assertion\r\n  that Vaccination diminished Smallpox or modified its virulence.\r\n  The process of determination was not rapid, but long before I\r\n  had formed a definite opinion, I was satisfied that _Compulsory_\r\n  Vaccination was indefensible; and my first efforts were directed\r\n  to the protection of my own children from the infliction.\r\n  Unsatisfied as to what Vaccination was, or what the Vaccinator\r\n  effected, I clearly saw that the State had no right to enforce a\r\n  practice by no means harmless, nor preventive of Smallpox, nor\r\n  easy to explain the use of.\r\n\r\nAs lecturer, debater and newspaper controversialist, Mr. Wheeler\r\nhas acquired well-earned distinction. Knowing far more of\r\nvaccination, its history, varieties, consequences, and statistics\r\nthan his adversaries, they are usually overthrown with a dexterity\r\nrealised as horrible and astonishing. Like savages with bows and\r\narrows, they come forth in the innocence of faith to encounter arms\r\nof precision. In 1878 Mr. Wheeler held a debate with Dr. George\r\nWyld, an enthusiastic advocate of the cowpox discarded by Jenner\r\nas impotent against smallpox. Sir Thomas Chambers presided, and\r\nthe question discussed being, “Is Vaccination worthy of National\r\nSupport?” How rash and how futile was Dr. Wyld’s championship is\r\nrecorded in the report of the debate.[300]\r\n\r\nMr. William Tebb is another well-known name in connection with the\r\nmovement against vaccination. For a time dubious, his attention was\r\nquickened and his course decided by the summons of the St. Pancras\r\nguardians to have his daughter, Beatrice, vaccinated. His refusal\r\nwas followed by prosecution after prosecution in the Marylebone\r\npolice-court, until at last the guardians gave up the contest as\r\nhopeless.[301] It was a bad day for vaccination when the compulsory\r\nlaw was applied to Mr. Tebb. As with many others, persecution\r\nmade of him an inflexible and active antagonist. His tongue, his\r\npen, and his purse, coupled with untiring industry and eminent\r\nexecutive ability, have been devoted to the exposure and overthrow\r\nof the conjoint superstition and tyranny. Mr. Tebb is a fine\r\nexemplification of Sir T. Fowell Buxton’s opinion, “Vigour, energy,\r\nresolution, firmness of purpose--these carry the day. Is there\r\none whom difficulties dishearten, who bends to the storm? He will\r\ndo little. Is there one who will conquer? That kind of man never\r\nfails:” adding, “The longer I live, the more I am certain that the\r\ngreat difference between men, between the feeble and the powerful,\r\nis energy--invincible determination, a purpose once fixed, and then\r\ndeath or victory. That quality will do anything that can he done\r\nin this world.”[302]\r\n\r\nMr. P. A. Taylor’s speeches in the House of Commons have been\r\nwidely read, but his Letter to Dr. W. B. Carpenter has been,\r\nperhaps, the most effective contribution to the good cause.[303]\r\nDr. Carpenter had volunteered for the defence of vaccination, and\r\nhad challenged Mr. Taylor; and being of a credulous and uncritical\r\nhabit of mind, he collected and recited the various legends and\r\nfactitious statistics that form the body of vaccination, with\r\nadditions from his private resources; thus constituting himself an\r\nobjective of attack, and providing Mr. Taylor with an excellent\r\nopportunity. Mr. Taylor accepted the challenge: he captured and\r\ndestroyed Dr. Carpenter’s positions seriatim, leaving him routed\r\nand helpless. The Letter has had an immense circulation, and its\r\ninfluence on public opinion is manifesting itself in a thousand\r\nways. Neither Dr. Carpenter nor any vaccinator has ventured to\r\nreply to Mr. Taylor; the fact being that no reply is possible.\r\nAny one who attentively reads Mr. Taylor’s Letter cannot fail to\r\nperceive that the practice represented by Dr. Carpenter is rooted\r\nin illusion and imposture. Silence under the circumstances may\r\ntherefore pass for discretion: silence on Dr. Carpenter’s part\r\npossesses a significance it would be difficult to misinterpret.\r\nIndeed, none know better than those responsible for vaccination as\r\na medical interest, that the less it is brought under discussion\r\nthe more likely it is to endure. _Quieta non movere_ is their\r\nmotto; and officious champions like Dr. Carpenter have little\r\nthanks for their restlessness.\r\n\r\nCorrespondence in newspapers is a well-recognised means for the\r\ndiffusion of new ideas, and in the use of this means the opponents\r\nof vaccination have acquired no little distinction. There is an\r\nincreasing number throughout the country who not only know their\r\nown case, but the case of their adversaries better than do their\r\nadversaries themselves; and if an editor has grace enough to\r\nmaintain a fair field and show no favour, the issue is invariably\r\nsatisfactory. Two able correspondents, who have gone hence, are\r\nespecially worthy of mention--Andrew Leighton and William Gibson\r\nWard. Mr. Leighton was a Liverpool merchant, who, having become\r\ninterested in the vaccination question, made its discussion the\r\noccupation of his leisure. With a clear and logical mind, patient,\r\nsagacious, and tolerant, prejudice itself could scarcely withstand\r\nhis sweet reasonableness. Almost to the day of his death, 14th\r\nJanuary, 1877, he was engaged in newspaper controversy, each\r\nletter bearing witness to his admirable temper and persuasive\r\npower.[304] Mr. Ward of Perriston Towers was a man of wide reading\r\nand perfervid character, who wrote and talked after the manner of\r\nCobbett, whom in many respects he resembled. Having discovered the\r\ntruth as concerned vaccination, he applied himself vigorously and\r\nsuccessfully to its diffusion. He sustained his prosecution as a\r\nparent with the joy of one who delights in battle; and, indeed,\r\nas it was said, a periodical prosecution would have suited him\r\nexactly, providing him with occasion for a rousing speech in\r\ncourt and a discussion with the bench, to be duly reported in\r\nthe Herefordshire newspapers. Mr. Ward died 18th October, 1882.\r\nLatterly he had access to _The Times_, and followed up a series\r\nof letters on subjects he had made his own with one on which he\r\nargued, that smallpox was neither an unmixed evil, nor a cause of\r\nextra mortality.[305]\r\n\r\nTo enter into a closer enumeration of those engaged in the movement\r\nagainst vaccination would be invidious and bound to imperfection.\r\nStill it would be grateful to refer to the various services of\r\nveterans like Sir Jervoise Clarke Jervoise, Mr. Thomas Baker,\r\nDr. Edward Haughton, Mr. T. B. Brett of St. Leonards, Mr. Edmund\r\nProctor of Newcastle, Mr. John Lucas of Gateshead, Mr. R. A.\r\nMilner of Keighley, Mr. W. F. Fox of Dewsbury, Dr. E. J. Crow of\r\nRipon, Mr. Francis Davis, jun., of Enniscorthy, Mr. Wm. Thurlow\r\nof Sudbury, Mr. Wm. Adair of Maryport, Mr. Charles Gillett of\r\nBanbury, Dr. T. L. Nichols, Mr. James Burns, and Mr. Amos Booth\r\nof Leicester. These and others have borne the odium of despised\r\ntruth, and live to see it steadily acquiring favour and force,\r\nwhilst the delusion to which it is opposed is entering the region\r\nof scepticism preparatory to dispersion and contempt.\r\n\r\nAll means are good against evil, but deeds are more than words; and\r\ntalk against vaccination counts far less than resistance to its\r\ninfliction. The more who are withheld from the rite, the more live\r\nto prove its inutility; and the more the law designed to enforce\r\nis set at defiance, the surer and sooner will be its overthrow.\r\nNevertheless, let us not forget what this warfare costs, nor how we\r\nare indebted to the men and women, brave, tender, and true, by whom\r\nit is endured. As a rule, the rich are exempt: the contest is with\r\nthe poor. As Mrs. Jacob Bright says--\r\n\r\n  I object to Compulsory Vaccination because it is an outrageous\r\n  piece of class legislation. No one in easy circumstances, no one\r\n  possessing the luxury of a family doctor, need have his child\r\n  vaccinated. He has only to tell his family doctor that he objects\r\n  to Vaccination, and the matter is at an end. Did ever any one\r\n  hear of a family doctor who threatened to prosecute the head of\r\n  a family for nonconformity in this respect? I think not. But\r\n  the family doctor of the poor is the parish doctor. He is quite\r\n  independent of his patient, and being paid by other people to\r\n  vaccinate them, he not only vaccinates them in many cases against\r\n  their will, but he does it _when_ he likes, and with _what_ virus\r\n  he likes, irrespective of the feelings or opinions they may\r\n  entertain.\r\n\r\n  I was riding some time ago in Sherwood Forest, and stopped to\r\n  ask for a glass of water at a cottage, where a poor woman was\r\n  standing with her fat little baby in her arms. I said, “You’ve\r\n  got a pretty boy there. Has he been vaccinated?” The mother’s\r\n  face, which was glowing with pride at praise of her boy, suddenly\r\n  fell, and she said, “No, madam, he hasn’t, but he’ll have to be.\r\n  We’ve lost one through it,” she added, with tears in her eyes.\r\n  She is one of a great number of poor people who, rightly or\r\n  wrongly, believe that Vaccination is dangerous, and yet are not\r\n  able to resist the pressure put upon them to vaccinate; they are\r\n  too poor, and in most cases have not the spirit to resist.\r\n\r\n  I say that it is disgraceful to fine and imprison people for\r\n  forming an independent opinion on a medical question; and it is\r\n  particularly disgraceful that my poor neighbour should be thus\r\n  persecuted when I am free, absolutely free, to please myself\r\n  whether my children shall be vaccinated. It is not possible that\r\n  this thing can continue.[306]\r\n\r\nThe contest, be it repeated, is with the poor. “There is no\r\ngetting over the fact,” says Dr. John Scott of Manchester, “that\r\nvaccination is hated among the working class, in Lancashire, at\r\nleast.” Vaccination is hated, and rightly hated, and the law is set\r\nto overcome that hatred. Multitudes submit because they either know\r\nnot how, or dread to do otherwise; but an honourable and increasing\r\nnumber prefer the better part--holding by what they recognise for\r\nright, resolved to obey God rather than man. It has been said,\r\n“The days of martyrdom, like those of miracles, have ceased”; but\r\nhave they? The record of humble English folk, who, during the\r\npast thirty years, have withstood the infamous Vaccination Acts,\r\nbears witness to the contrary. Martyrdom and heroism are rarely\r\nrecognised by those who occasion or dislike their manifestation:\r\nit is sympathy that opens the eyes to their appearance. Unknown\r\nor despised, these medical nonconformists have stood true to\r\ntheir faith in the order of nature against doctor-craft, and have\r\ncounted nothing dear to them if so be they could preserve their\r\nchildren and conscience from outrage. They have been prosecuted\r\nwith all the malice and pertinacity of petty authority--of Justice\r\nShallow and Bumble; have been insulted from the judgment seat; have\r\nbeen fined to the uttermost farthing and loaded with uttermost\r\ncosts, and this repeatedly; have had their goods and furniture\r\ndistrained, and their homes broken up; have been sent to jail\r\nwith hard labour, and subjected to every indignity and cruelty of\r\nthe prison-house; have been hunted from parish to parish, and in\r\ndespair driven to exile. And these have been Englishmen, the law\r\nEnglish, and the time our own! The Master of the Rolls recently\r\nobserved, “What is contrary to the feelings of every honest man\r\ncannot be the law of England--or, if it be, the sooner it ceases\r\nto be law the better.” It would be unfair to charge the injustice\r\nof the Vaccination Acts to the English people. To most of them\r\ntheir character and operation are unknown. The chief sufferers are\r\nhidden under the hatches of poverty, and are unable to make the\r\nland resound with their wrongs. Those, too, who essay to speak\r\nfor them are confronted with that obdurate dulness with which the\r\nearly Free-Traders had to contend when restriction was thought to\r\nbe as good for commerce as cowpox is thought to be good for health\r\nin stopping smallpox. Mr. Bright, in praising the speeches of Mr.\r\nVilliers at Birmingham, 29th January, 1884, remarked--\r\n\r\n  I mention their publication to revive the strange and painful\r\n  fact that during the years when those speeches--so convincing,\r\n  so absolutely unanswerable, were spoken in the House of Commons,\r\n  they were addressed, as it were, to men morally stone deaf.\r\n  The arguments were not answered, the facts adduced were not\r\n  disproved, the appalling suffering of the people was not denied.\r\n\r\nA similar deafness to the oppression of compulsory vaccination\r\nprevails, though there are signs of awakening. Still it is not for\r\nthose who suffer to wait on politicians. The words are trite, but\r\ntrue as trite--\r\n\r\n                                      “Know ye not,\r\n      Who would be free, themselves must strike the blow?”\r\n\r\nMany are discovering that in union is strength. Combinations for\r\nmutual protection and insurance against penalties are multiplying.\r\nResist and Organise is their watchword: organise, study the\r\nlaw, find out its weak places, make the most of them, harass\r\nits administrators, vote only for guardians who are opposed to\r\ncompulsion; and, in short, do whatever is possible to frustrate\r\nthe pernicious legislation.\r\n\r\nSometimes it is asked, “Why not obey the law and agitate for\r\nits repeal?” but the suggestion is designed for stultification.\r\nSuppose the Society of Friends had consented to take oaths until\r\nthe law was adjusted to their consciences, would they not have\r\nbeen swearing to this day? Suppose some dissenters had not refused\r\nto pay church rates, when would church rates have been abolished?\r\nSuppose the Irish had submitted to English rule until convinced by\r\nreason of the wickedness and folly of their domination, how long\r\nwould they have had to wait for the redress of their wrongs? Such\r\nquestions might be run over pages, but to what purpose? All know\r\n(unless submerged in cant) that those who would have must take;\r\nand that no man’s rights can be entrusted to another’s good-will,\r\nbe the trustee ever so just. Vaccination is a medical monopoly\r\nestablished, endowed, and enforced--a tyranny to be overthrown.\r\nThose who profit by it will never consent to its surrender,\r\nwhatever the evidence of its inutility and mischief: it would be\r\nagainst experience to expect otherwise: and they will never be\r\nso valiant in defence of their monopoly, and so profuse in the\r\nassertion of its overwhelming advantages, as when its dissolution\r\nis imminent. The wise understand these things. There is, therefore,\r\nbut one way in which to get rid of the incubus, and that way is\r\noutright resistance. Already such resistance has proved successful\r\nin several parts of the country. The law has been reduced to\r\nabeyance, and similar resistance will be rewarded with similar\r\nresults. Moreover, further legislation in favour of vaccination has\r\nbeen checked. Parliament will pass no more Vaccination Acts. The\r\nplague thus far is stayed: the worst possible has been seen: the\r\nbusiness is to clear away what remains.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes said that vaccination is unnatural, and the saying\r\nis disregarded as unscientific or absurd. But is it unscientific?\r\nand is it absurd? Men deserve an order in Nature, and when they\r\nperceive that any procedure is at variance with that order, they\r\ninstinctively condemn it as unnatural, though possibly they may be\r\nunable to give a philosophic account of their aversion.\r\n\r\nWe unite in the assertion that vaccination is unnatural, and when\r\nwe are asked, Why? we answer, Because it is an operation which\r\nviolates the order maintained in the formation of the blood. If\r\nwe follow food into the stomach and attend to the processes of\r\ndigestion, rejection, and assimilation--the infinite care, in\r\nshort, with which blood is made, we shall start back with dislike,\r\nand even horror, from a practice which sets at naught all this\r\ncare; which attacks the blood directly, and attacks it to poison\r\nit. Hence it is that vaccination is stigmatised as unnatural,\r\nbeing a process which not only reverses the course of Nature in\r\nblood-making, but doubly unnatural, as violating that course and\r\npoisoning its product.\r\n\r\nTo re-affirm and illustrate our meaning, we take the following\r\npiece of physiological poetry, poetic yet scientifically accurate,\r\nfrom Dr. Garth Wilkinson--\r\n\r\n  In the human body, whatever enters the blood, be it even the\r\n  most bland food, the juice of the grape or the pomegranate, or\r\n  the fine flour of wheat, be it oil, wine, or fig, is broken up\r\n  first, and then led inwards through long avenues of introduction.\r\n  The most innocent food goes in most easily and first. The police\r\n  and surveillance for the rest are exceeding great and many. The\r\n  senses electively appetise the fine food; it has to pass through\r\n  their peremptory doors of liking and disliking; instructed doors\r\n  of memory, association, imagination, reason, wisdom, religion,\r\n  in adults. It is then attacked by digestive salivas, tests,\r\n  examinations, and severe juices, and questioned to the uttermost\r\n  in that degree, which corresponds to the former. It is strained\r\n  through organ after organ; each a tribunal of more than social\r\n  exactitude. It is absorbed by the finest systems of choice in\r\n  pore and vessel, organic judgment sitting in every corner, and\r\n  presiding over each inner doorway. It is submitted to glandular\r\n  and lung purifications, and their furnaces of trials and\r\n  eliminations. At last it is weighed in the balances, and minted\r\n  by supreme nerve wisdoms; and only after all these processes is\r\n  it admitted into the golden blood. This of the best food, such\r\n  as good and wise men eat. The worst food is made the best of by\r\n  a constant passage through bodily mercies and mitigations--a\r\n  no less sedulous though a penal process. This is physiology,\r\n  and divine-human decency, and like a man’s life. Vaccination\r\n  traverses and tramples upon all these safeguards and wisdoms;\r\n  it goes direct to the blood, or, still worse, to the lymph, and\r\n  not with food; it puts poison, introduced by puncture, and that\r\n  has no test applicable to it, and can have no character given\r\n  to it but that it is fivefold animal and human poison, at a\r\n  blow into the very centre, thus otherwise guarded by nature in\r\n  the providence of God. This is blood assassination, and like a\r\n  murderer’s life.[307]\r\n\r\nFinally, vaccination is an attempt to swindle Nature. The\r\nvaccinator says, “Come, my little dear, come and let me give you a\r\ndisease wherewith I shall so hoax Nature that henceforth you may\r\nlive in what stench you please, and smallpox shall not catch you.”\r\nBut can Nature be swindled? can Nature be hoaxed? Mr. Lowell, in\r\npraising the genius of Cervantes, says, “There is a moral in _Don\r\nQuixote_, and a very profound one it is--that whoever quarrels\r\nwith Nature, whether wittingly or unwittingly, is certain to get\r\nthe worst of it.” There is sometimes an apparent triumph over\r\nNature. We do wrong, and fancy we may evade the penalty by some\r\ncunning contrivance, but ere long we perceive with dismay that the\r\nconsequences were only concealed or staved off, and that we have to\r\nanswer to the uttermost farthing. Vaccination is a dodge kindred\r\nwith incantations and similar performances whereby it is hoped to\r\ncircumvent the order of the Highest, and compel his favour apart\r\nfrom obedience to his will. By artifice it is attempted to obviate\r\na consequence of ill-living, whilst persisting in ill-living; but\r\nif it were possible to escape smallpox by such means, we should\r\nhave equal punishment in some other mode. No: smallpox with its\r\nalternatives and equivalents can only be avoided through compliance\r\nwith the old-fashioned prescription, “Wash you, make you clean;\r\ncease to do evil, learn to do well.” The lesson is hard to learn,\r\nand harder to practise; but there is no evading it if we would be\r\nhealthy and happy. Wherefore all tricks like vaccination are bound\r\nto nullity and disaster. As Hosea Biglow says--\r\n\r\n      “You hev gut to git up airly\r\n        Ef you want to take in God.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  WILLIAM A. GUY, F.R.C.P., F.R.S.\r\n\r\n  Is Vaccination a preventive of Smallpox? To this question there\r\n  is, there can be, no answer except such as is couched in the\r\n  language of figures.--_Journal of the Statistical Society_, 1882,\r\n  vol. xlv. p. 414.\r\n\r\n  G. F. KOLB,\r\n\r\n  _Member of the Royal Statistical Commission of Bavaria._\r\n\r\n  From childhood I had been trained to look upon Cowpox as an\r\n  absolute protective from Smallpox. I believed in Vaccination\r\n  more strongly than in any ecclesiastical dogma. Numerous and\r\n  acknowledged failures did not shake my faith. I attributed them\r\n  either to the carelessness of the operator or the badness of the\r\n  lymph.\r\n\r\n  In course of time the question of Compulsory Vaccination came\r\n  before the Reichstag, when a medical friend supplied me with a\r\n  mass of statistics in favour of Vaccination, in his opinion,\r\n  conclusive and unanswerable. This awoke the statistician\r\n  within me. On inspection, I found the figures delusive; and\r\n  closer examination left no shadow of doubt in my mind that the\r\n  statistical array of proof represented a complete failure.\r\n\r\n  My investigations were continued, and my judgment was confirmed.\r\n  For instance, Cowpox was introduced to Bavaria in 1807, and for\r\n  a long time none, except the newly-born, escaped Vaccination;\r\n  nevertheless in the epidemic of 1871, of 30,472 cases of\r\n  Smallpox, no less than 29,429 were vaccinated, as is shown in the\r\n  documents of the State.--_From Letter to_ MR.

To have admitted the truth of a doctrine, at once\r\n  so novel and so unlike anything that had ever appeared in the\r\n  Annals of Medicine, without the test of the most rigid scrutiny,\r\n  would have bordered upon temerity; but now, when that scrutiny\r\n  has taken place, not only among ourselves, but in the first\r\n  professional circles in Europe, and when it has been uniformly\r\n  found in such abundant instances, that the human frame, when\r\n  once it has felt the influence of the genuine Cow Pox in the\r\n  way that has been described, is never afterwards, at any period\r\n  of its existence, assailable by the Small Pox, may I not with\r\n  perfect confidence congratulate my country and society at large\r\n  on their beholding in the mild form of the Cow Pox, an antidote\r\n  that is capable of extirpating from the earth a disease which is\r\n  every hour devouring its victims; a disease that has ever been\r\n  considered as the severest scourge of the human race.--Pp. 166,\r\n  338-339, 357, 365, 473.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Origin of Vaccine Inoculation._ London: 1801.\r\n\r\n  1801.--It now becomes too manifest to admit of controversy, that\r\n  the annihilation of the Small Pox, the most dreadful scourge of\r\n  the human species, must be the final result of this practice.--P.\r\n  183.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Petition for Remuneration to House of Commons._ 1802.\r\n\r\n  1802.--Cow Pox admits of being inoculated on the human frame\r\n  with the most perfect ease and safety, and is attended with\r\n  the singularly beneficial effect of rendering through life the\r\n  persons so inoculated perfectly secure from the infection of the\r\n  Small Pox.--Pp. 184, 337, 355.\r\n\r\n\r\n_On the Varieties and Modifications of the Vaccine Pustule\r\noccasioned by an Herpetic State of the Skin._ Printed in _Medical\r\nand Physical Journal_, August, 1804; and reprinted as a pamphlet,\r\nCheltenham, 1806, and Gloucester, 1819.--P. 340.\r\n\r\n\r\nVACCINATION EQUAL TO VARIOLATION.\r\n\r\n  1804.--What I have said on Vaccination is true. If properly\r\n  conducted it secures the constitution as much as Variolous\r\n  Inoculation possibly can.--Baron’s _Life of Jenner_, vol. ii. p.\r\n  15.\r\n\r\n  Duly and efficiently performed, Vaccination will protect the\r\n  constitution from subsequent attacks of Small Pox as much as that\r\n  disease itself will. I never expected that it would do more, and\r\n  it will not, I believe, do less.--_Ibid._ p. 135.\r\n\r\n  1806.--The security given to the constitution by Vaccine\r\n  Inoculation is _exactly equal_ to that given by the Variolous.\r\n  To expect more from it would be wrong. As failures in the latter\r\n  are constantly presenting themselves, we must expect to find\r\n  them in the former also.--_Letter to Richard Dunning, 1st March,\r\n  1806._--Pp. 339, 355.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Facts for the most part unobserved or not duly noticed respecting\r\nVariolous Contagion._ London: 1808.\r\n\r\n  1808.--It should be remembered that the constitution _cannot_,\r\n  by previous infection, _be rendered totally insusceptible of the\r\n  Variolous Poison_.

It is in vain for Nonconformists to plead that\r\nthey do not believe that Vaccination has any power to prevent\r\nor to mitigate smallpox, or that it is attended by the risk of\r\ncommunicating foul diseases. They are told they may believe what\r\nthey like, but that vaccinated they must be, for the benefit of the\r\nrite is settled beyond dispute, and that only fools and fanatics\r\nventure to question what has been irrevocably determined.\r\n\r\nIt is to attack and overthrow this monstrous tyranny that the\r\nLONDON SOCIETY has been established. The members desire to\r\nenlighten the public mind as to the history of Vaccination, as to\r\nits injury in communicating and intensifying other diseases, and as\r\nto the failure of the compulsory law to stamp out or even diminish\r\nthe ravages of smallpox. Many too, whilst disinclined to discuss\r\nVaccination as a medical question, or to surrender confidence in\r\nits prophylaxy, are opposed to its compulsory infliction. They\r\nmaintain that every remedy should be left to justify itself by\r\nits own efficacy, and that of all prescriptions the last which\r\nrequires extraneous assistance is Vaccination; for its repute is\r\nbased on the fact that its subjects are secure from smallpox,\r\nand in that security may abide indifferent to those who choose\r\nto neglect its salvation. Even nurses in smallpox hospitals,\r\nit is said, when efficiently vaccinated and revaccinated, live\r\nunaffected in the variolous atmosphere. Therefore, they hold that\r\nto compare an unvaccinated person to a nuisance, as is frequently\r\ndone, is to make use of an epithet that implicitly denies the\r\nvirtue asserted for Vaccination, a nuisance being a voluntary\r\ndanger or annoyance which another cannot conveniently avoid. They\r\nalso hold that to establish any medical prescription, and to\r\ncreate interests identified with that prescription, is to erect\r\na bar to improvement; for it is obvious that any novelty in the\r\ntreatment of smallpox must, in the constitution of human nature,\r\nmeet with resistance from those whose emoluments are vested in the\r\nestablished practice.\r\n\r\nThe LONDON SOCIETY, therefore, claims to enlist the energies, not\r\nonly of those who resist Vaccination as useless and mischievous,\r\nbut also of those who, true to their faith in liberty, would\r\nleave its acceptance to the discretion of the individual. In the\r\ncontroversy into which they enter, they propose to employ all the\r\nfamiliar agencies wherewith in England revolutions are effected in\r\nthe public mind and in Parliament; and they appeal with confidence\r\nfor the sympathy and support of their countrymen. The Vaccination\r\nActs under which they suffer have not been enacted with the full\r\ncognizance of the nation, but have been forced through indifferent\r\nParliaments by the persistency of medical faction. The members\r\nof the SOCIETY are confident that, as soon as the truth about\r\nVaccination is fully known and appreciated, the freedom they\r\ncontend for will be conceded without fear, and that posterity will\r\nview with amazement the outrage upon human right and reason that is\r\nat present committed under the shadow of English liberty.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nPrejudice, which sees what it pleases, cannot see what is\r\nplain.--AUBREY DE VERE.\r\n\r\nHe who knows only his own side of the case, knows little of\r\nthat.--J.

We hear on every\r\nside that we cannot be secure from Smallpox unless we have our\r\nblood poisoned with Cowpox in infancy, in adolescence, and at\r\nstated periods throughout life. The prescription is so unnatural\r\nthat only custom renders it tolerable; it excites suspicion and\r\naversion wherever rationally considered; and dislike and disgust\r\nare justified by inquiry. Smallpox is not averted by Vaccination;\r\nand the virus introduced to the blood bears with it other diseases,\r\neven the worst of diseases, and enfeebles and predisposes the\r\nconstitution to other maladies. In short, Vaccination under cover\r\nof maintaining the common health inflicts upon it serious and\r\ndeadly injuries. And by a strange exercise of tyranny, this most\r\nmischievous superstition is made compulsory and enforced by fine\r\nand imprisonment; and Englishmen are dragged from their homes and\r\ntreated as convicts because they refuse to submit their children to\r\nthe abominable rite. Mr. BRIGHT says, “THE LAW IS MONSTROUS, AND\r\nOUGHT TO BE REPEALED.” Yet is this monstrous law maintained!\r\n\r\nPossibly you are opposed to Vaccination, or indifferent, or a\r\nbeliever. In any case, I ask you to subscribe for the VACCINATION\r\nINQUIRER. If you are opposed to Vaccination, it will stimulate\r\nand inform your opposition; if indifferent, it will remove your\r\nindifference; if you are a believer in the rite, it may convert you\r\nto a better mind.\r\n\r\n    WILLIAM YOUNG, _Secretary_,\r\n    114 Victoria Street, WESTMINSTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nWORKS ON VACCINATION.\r\n\r\nWilliam White.\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Lyon Playfair taken to Pieces and disposed of: likewise Sir\r\nCharles W.

Second Edition. 6th thousand. 1s.\r\n\r\n  “It is a very dainty pamphlet of two hundred pages, so printed\r\n  that it is a luxury to read. There are six pages of index, which\r\n  will give some idea of its fulness of matter. Mr. White does all\r\n  his work in a workmanlike way, and this work is no exception. He\r\n  gives the two speeches of Playfair and Dilke in full, and fully\r\n  answers them. They are literally taken to pieces and disposed\r\n  of. Read William White on Playfair and Dilke. It is the end of\r\n  controversy. Reply is impossible.”--_Herald of Health._\r\n\r\n  “Mr. White has done what has never been done before,--that is,\r\n  he has taken to pieces Sir Lyon Playfair’s speech, analysed his\r\n  arguments, and exposed much of what is untrustworthy. The book\r\n  ought to be in the hands of all who desire to understand the\r\n  question of Vaccination.”--_Newcastle Weekly Chronicle._\r\n\r\n  “This is a clever and most reasonable criticism and overhauling\r\n  of Playfair and Dilke’s opinions, of which the best idea can\r\n  be gained from a study of the book itself, which will be found\r\n  complete in every detail.”--_Brighton Gazette._\r\n\r\n  “The official vindication of vaccination was contained in Sir\r\n  Lyon Playfair’s speech backed up by Sir Charles Dilke, and Mr.\r\n  White has taken the various points of both speeches, item by\r\n  item, and has replied to them with a clearness and effectiveness\r\n  which must go far to shake the foundation of vaccination itself;\r\n  whilst, in our view, it effectually disposes of the plea for\r\n  _compulsory_ vaccination.”--_Northamptonshire Guardian._\r\n\r\n  “Anti-Vaccinationists will gloat over these pages. It is said\r\n  that anything can be done with figures. We certainly at the time\r\n  thought that Sir Lyon Playfair showed they were in favour of\r\n  vaccination. On reading Mr. White’s book we are just as keenly\r\n  impressed with an opposite view. We recommend the work to our\r\n  readers.”--_Eastern Daily Press._\r\n\r\n  “A remarkably well-written book by a practised hand.
