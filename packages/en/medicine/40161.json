In doing so, he has not only\r\ndone his best to combine and classify old stories, but also cautiously\r\nto select his materials, so that his work, while affording amusement\r\nto the leisure hours of Doctors learned in their craft, might contain\r\nno line that should render it unfit for the drawing-room table. To\r\neffect this, it has been found necessary to reject many valuable and\r\ncharacteristic anecdotes--some of them entering too minutely into the\r\nmysteries and technicalities of medicine and surgery, and some being\r\nspiced with a humour ill calculated to please the delicacy of the\r\nnineteenth century.\r\n\r\nMuch of the contents of this volume has never before been published,\r\nbut, after being drawn from a variety of manuscript sources, is now\r\nfor the first time submitted to the world. It would be difficult to\r\nenumerate all the persons to whom the writer is indebted for access to\r\ndocuments, suggestions, critical notes, or memoranda. He cannot,\r\nhowever, let the present occasion go by without expressing his\r\ngratitude to the College of Physicians, for the prompt urbanity with\r\nwhich they allowed him to inspect the treasures of their library. To\r\nDr. Munk, the learned librarian of the College--who for many years, in\r\nthe scant leisure allowed him by the urgent demands of an extensive\r\npractice, has found a dignified pastime in antiquarian and biographic\r\nresearch--the writer's best thanks are due. With a liberality by no\r\nmeans always found in a student possessed of \"special information,\"\r\nthe Doctor surrendered his precious stores to the use of a comparative\r\nstranger, apparently without even thinking of the value of his gift.\r\nBut even more than to the librarian of the College of Physicians the\r\nwriter is indebted for assistance to his very kind friend Dr. Diamond,\r\nof Twickenham House--a gentleman who, to all the best qualities of a\r\ncomplete physician, unites the graces of a scholarly mind, an\r\nenthusiasm for art, and the fascinations of a generous nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA BOOK ABOUT DOCTORS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nSOMETHING ABOUT STICKS, AND RATHER LESS ABOUT WIGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nProperly treated and fully expanded, this subject of \"the stick\" would\r\ncover all the races of man in all regions and all ages; indeed, it\r\nwould hide every member of the human family. Attention could be called\r\nto the respect accorded in every chapter of the world's history,\r\nsacred and profane, to the _rabdos_--to the fasces of the Roman\r\nlictors, which every school-boy honours (often unconsciously) with an\r\nallusion when he says he will _lick_, or vows he won't be\r\n_licked_,--to the herald's staff of Hermes, the caduceus of Mercury,\r\nthe wand of Æsculapius, and the rods of Moses and the contending\r\nsorcerers--to the mystic bundles of nine twigs, in honour of the nine\r\nmuses, that Dr. Busby loved to wield, and which many a simple English\r\nparent believes Solomon, in all his glory, recommended as an element\r\nin domestic jurisdiction--to the sacred wands of savage tribes, the\r\nstaffs of our constables and sheriffs, and the highly polished gold\r\nsticks and black rods that hover about the anterooms of St. James's or\r\nPortsoken. The rule of thumb has been said to be the government of\r\nthis world. And what is this thumb but a short stick, a _sceptre_,\r\nemblematic of a sovereign authority which none dares to dispute? \"The\r\nstick,\" says the Egyptian proverb, \"came down from heaven.\"\r\n\r\nThe only sticks, however, that we here care to speak about are\r\nphysicians' canes, barbers' poles, and the twigs of rue which are\r\nstill strewn before the prisoner in the dock of a criminal court. Why\r\nshould they be thus strung together?\r\n\r\nThe physician's cane is a very ancient part of his insignia. It is now\r\ndisused, but up to very recent times no doctor of medicine presumed to\r\npay a professional visit, or even to be seen in public, without this\r\nmystic wand. Long as a footman's stick, smooth and varnished, with a\r\nheavy gold knob or cross-bar at the top, it was an instrument with\r\nwhich, down to the present century, every prudent aspirant to medical\r\npractice was provided. The celebrated \"gold-headed cane\" which\r\nRadcliffe, Mead, Askew, Pitcairn and Baillie successively bore is\r\npreserved in the College of Physicians, bearing the arms which those\r\ngentlemen assumed, or were entitled to. In one respect it deviated\r\nfrom the physician's cane proper. It has a cross-bar almost like a\r\ncrook; whereas a physician's wand ought to have a knob at the top.\r\nThis knob in olden times was hollow, and contained a vinaigrette,\r\nwhich the man of science always held to his nose when he approached a\r\nsick person, so that its fumes might protect him from the noxious\r\nexhalations of his patient. We know timid people who, on the same\r\nplan, have their handkerchiefs washed in camphor-water, and bury their\r\nfaces in them whenever they pass the corner of a dingy street, or\r\ncross an open drain, or come in contact with an ill-looking man. When\r\nHoward, the philanthropist, visited Exeter, he found that the medical\r\nofficer of the county gaol had caused a clause to be inserted in his\r\nagreement with the magistrates, exonerating him from attendance and\r\nservices during any outbreak of the gaol fever. Most likely this\r\ngentleman, by books or experience, had been enlightened as to the\r\ninefficacy of the vinaigrette.\r\n\r\nBut though the doctor, like a soldier skulking from the field of\r\nbattle, might with impunity decline visiting the wretched captives,\r\nthe judge was forced to do his part of the social duty to them--to sit\r\nin their presence during their trial in a close, fetid court; to\r\nbrow-beat them when they presumed to make any declaration of their\r\ninnocence beyond a brief \"not guilty\"; to read them an energetic\r\nhomily on the consequences of giving way to corrupt passions and evil\r\nmanners; and, finally, to order them their proper apportionments of\r\nwhipping, or incarceration, or banishment, or death. Such was the\r\nabominable condition of our prisons, that the poor creatures dragged\r\nfrom them and placed in the dock often by the noxious effluvia of\r\ntheir bodies made seasoned criminal lawyers turn pale--partly,\r\nperhaps, through fear, but chiefly through physical discomfort. Then\r\narose the custom of sprinkling aromatic herbs before the prisoners--so\r\nthat if the health of his Lordship and the gentlemen of the long robe\r\nsuffered from the tainted atmosphere, at least their senses of smell\r\nmight be shocked as little as possible. Then, also, came the\r\nchaplain's bouquet, with which that reverend officer was always\r\nprovided when accompanying a criminal to Tyburn. Coke used to go\r\ncircuit carrying in his hand an enormous fan furnished with a handle,\r\nin the shape of a goodly stick--the whole forming a weapon of offence\r\nor defence. It is not improbable that the shrewd lawyer caused the end\r\nof this cumbrous instrument to be furnished with a vinaigrette.\r\n\r\nSo much for the head of the physician's cane. The stick itself was\r\ndoubtless a relic of the conjuring paraphernalia with which the\r\nhealer, in ignorant and superstitious times, worked upon the\r\nimagination of the credulous. Just as the ? which the doctor affixes\r\nto his prescription is the old astrological sign (ill-drawn) of\r\nJupiter, so his cane descended to him from Hermes and Mercurius. It\r\nwas a relic of old jugglery, and of yet older religion--one of those\r\nbaubles which we know well where to find, but which our conservative\r\ntendencies disincline us to sweep away without some grave necessity.\r\n\r\nThe charming-stick, the magic Æsculapian wand of the Medicine-man,\r\ndiffered in shape and significance from the pole of the\r\nbarber-surgeon. In the \"British Apollo,\" 1703, No. 3, we read:--\r\n\r\n    \"I'd know why he that selleth ale\r\n    Hangs out a chequer'd part per pale:\r\n    And why a barber at port-hole\r\n    Puts forth a parti-coloured pole?\"\r\n\r\n                     ANSWER.\r\n\r\n    \"In ancient Rome, when men loved fighting,\r\n    And wounds and scars took much delight in,\r\n    Man-menders then had noble pay--\r\n    Which we call surgeons to this day.\r\n    'Twas order'd that a huge long pole,\r\n    With basin deck'd, should grace the hole,\r\n    To guide the wounded, who unlopt\r\n    Could walk, on stumps the other hopt;\r\n    But when they ended all their wars,\r\n    And men grew out of love with scars.\r\n    Their trade decaying, to keep swimming,\r\n    They joined the other trade of trimming;\r\n    And to their poles, to publish either,\r\n    Thus twisted both their trades together.\"\r\n\r\nThe principal objection that can be made to this answer is that it\r\nleaves the question unanswered, after making only a very lame attempt\r\nto answer it. Lord Thurlow, in a speech delivered in the House of\r\nPeers on 17th of July, 1797, opposing the surgeons' incorporation\r\nbill, said that, \"By a statute still in force, the barbers and\r\nsurgeons were each to use a pole. The barbers were to have theirs blue\r\nand white, striped with no other appendage; but the surgeons', which\r\nwas the same in other respects, was likewise to have a gallipot and a\r\nred rag, to denote the particular nature of their vocation.\"\r\n\r\nBut the reason why the surgeon's pole was adorned with both blue and\r\nred seems to have escaped the Chancellor. The chirurgical pole,\r\nproperly tricked, ought to have a line of blue paint, another of red,\r\nand a third of white, winding round its length, in a regular\r\nserpentine progression--the blue representing the venous blood, the\r\nmore brilliant colour the arterial, and the white thread being\r\nsymbolic of the bandage used in tying up the arm after withdrawing the\r\nligature. The stick itself is a sign that the operator possesses a\r\nstout staff for his patients to hold, continually tightening and\r\nrelaxing their grasp during the operation--accelerating the flow of\r\nthe blood by the muscular action of the arm. The phlebotomist's staff\r\nis of great antiquity. It is to be found amongst his properties, in an\r\nilluminated missal of the time of Edward the First, and in an\r\nengraving of the \"Comenii Orbis Pictus.\"\r\n\r\nPossibly in ancient times the physician's cane and the surgeon's club\r\nwere used more actively. For many centuries fustigation was believed\r\nin as a sovereign remedy for bodily ailment as well as moral failings,\r\nand a beating was prescribed for an ague as frequently as for picking\r\nand stealing. This process Antonius Musa employed to cure Octavius\r\nAugustus of Sciatica. Thomas Campanella believed that it had the same\r\neffect as colocynth administered internally. Galen recommended it as a\r\nmeans of fattening people. Gordonius prescribed it in certain cases of\r\nnervous irritability--\"Si sit juvenis, et non vult obedire,\r\nflagelletur frequenter et fortiter.\" In some rural districts ignorant\r\nmothers still flog the feet of their children to cure them of\r\nchilblains. And there remains on record a case in which club-tincture\r\nproduced excellent results on a young patient to whom Desault gave a\r\nliberal dose of it.\r\n\r\nIn 1792, when Sir Astley Cooper was in Paris, he attended the lectures\r\nof Desault and Chopart in the Hotel Dieu. On one occasion, during this\r\npart of his student course, Cooper saw a young fellow, of some sixteen\r\nyears of age, brought before Desault complaining of paralysis in his\r\nright arm. Suspecting that the boy was only shamming, \"Abraham,\"\r\nDesault observed, unconcernedly, \"Otez votre chapeau.\"\r\n\r\nForgetting his paralytic story, the boy instantly obeyed, and\r\nuncovered his head.\r\n\r\n\"Donnez moi un baton!\" screamed Desault; and he beat the boy\r\nunmercifully.\r\n\r\n\"D'ou venez vous?\" inquired the operator when the castigation was\r\nbrought to a close.\r\n\r\n\"Faubourg de St. Antoine,\" was the answer.\r\n\r\n\"Oui, je le crois,\" replied Desault, with a shrug--speaking a truth\r\nexperience had taught him--\"tous les coquins viennent de ce quartier\r\nla.\"\r\n\r\nBut enough for the present of the barber-surgeon and his pole.\r\n\"Tollite barberum,\"--as Bonnel Thornton suggested, when in 1745 (a\r\nyear barbarous in more ways than one), the surgeons, on being\r\ndisjoined from the barbers, were asking what ought to be their motto.\r\n\r\nNext to his cane, the physician's wig was the most important of his\r\naccoutrements. It gave profound learning and wise thought to lads just\r\nout of their teens. As the horse-hair skull-cap gives idle Mr.\r\nBriefless all the acuteness and gravity of aspect which one looks for\r\nin an attorney-general, so the doctor's artificial locks were to him a\r\ncrown of honour. One of the Dukes of Holstein, in the eighteenth\r\ncentury, just missed destruction through being warned not to put on\r\nhis head a poisoned wig which a traitorous peruke-maker offered him.\r\nTo test the value of the advice given him, the Duke had the wig put\r\nupon the head of its fabricator. Within twelve minutes the man\r\nexpired! We have never heard of a physician finding death in a wig;\r\nbut a doctor who found the means of life in one is no rare bird in\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n    \"Each son of Sol, to make him look more big,\r\n    Had on a large, grave, decent, three-tailed wig;\r\n    His clothes full-trimmed, with button-holes behind,\r\n    Stiff were the skirts, with buckram stoutly lined;\r\n    The cloth-cut velvet, or more reverend black,\r\n    Full-made, and powder'd half-way down his back;\r\n    Large decent cuffs, which near the ground did reach,\r\n    With half a dozen buttons fix'd on each.\r\n    Grave were their faces--fix'd in solemn state,\r\n    These men struck awe; their children carried weight,\r\n    In reverend wigs old heads young shoulders bore,\r\n    And twenty-five or thirty seemed threescore.\"\r\n\r\nThe three-tailed wig was the one worn by Will Atkins, the gout doctor\r\nin Charles the Second's time (a good specialty then!). Will Atkins\r\nlived in the Old Bailey, and had a vast practice. His nostrums, some\r\nof which were composed of _thirty_ different ingredients, were\r\nwonderful--but far less so than his wig, which was combed and frizzled\r\nover each cheek. When Will walked about the town, visiting his\r\npatients, he sometimes carried a cane, but never wore a hat. Such an\r\narticle of costume would have disarranged the beautiful locks, or, at\r\nleast, have obscured their glory.\r\n\r\n    \"Physic of old her entry made\r\n    Beneath th' immense full-bottom's shade;\r\n    While the gilt cane, with solemn pride,\r\n    To each sagacious nose applied,\r\n    Seem'd but a necessary prop\r\n    To bear the weight of wig at top.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the most magnificent wigs on record was that of Colonel\r\nDalmahoy, which was celebrated in a song beginning:--\r\n\r\n    \"If you would see a noble wig,\r\n    And in that wig a man look big,\r\n    To Ludgate Hill repair, my joy,\r\n    And gaze on Col'nel Dalmahoy.\"\r\n\r\nOn Ludgate Hill, in close proximity to the Hall of the Apothecaries in\r\nWater Lane, the Colonel vended drugs and nostrums of all\r\nsorts--sweetmeats, washes for the complexion, scented oil for the\r\nhair, pomades, love-drops, and charms. Wadd, the humorous collector of\r\nanecdotes relating to his profession, records of him--\r\n\r\n    \"Dalmahoy sold infusions and lotions,\r\n      Decoctions, and gargles, and pills;\r\n    Electuaries, powders, and potions,\r\n      Spermaceti, salts, scammony, squills.\r\n\r\n    \"Horse-aloes, burnt alum, agaric,\r\n      Balm, benzoine, blood-stone, and dill;\r\n    Castor, camphor, and acid tartaric,\r\n      With specifics for every ill.\r\n\r\n    \"But with all his specifics in store,\r\n      Death on Dalmahoy one day did pop;\r\n    And although he had doctors a score,\r\n      Made poor Dalmahoy shut up his shop.\"\r\n\r\nThe last silk-coated physician was Henry Revell Reynolds, M. D., one\r\nof the physicians who attended George III. during his long and\r\nmelancholy affliction. Though this gentleman came quite down to living\r\ntimes, he persisted to the end in wearing the costume--of a\r\nwell-powdered wig, silk coat, breeches, stockings, buckled shoes,\r\ngold-headed cane, and lace ruffles--with which he commenced his\r\ncareer. He was the Brummel of the Faculty, and retained his fondness\r\nfor delicate apparel to the last. Even in his grave-clothes the\r\ncoxcombical tastes of the man exhibited themselves. His very cerements\r\nwere of \"a good make.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Here well-dressed Reynolds lies.\r\n      As great a beau as ever;\r\n    We may perhaps see one as wise,\r\n      But sure a smarter never.\"\r\n\r\nWhilst Brocklesby's wig is still bobbing about in the distance, we may\r\nas well tell a good story of him. He was an eccentric man, with many\r\ngood points, one of which was his friendship for Dr. Johnson. The\r\nDuchess of Richmond requested Brocklesby to visit her maid, who was so\r\nill that she could not leave her bed. The physician proceeded\r\nforthwith to Richmond House, in obedience to the command. On arriving\r\nthere he was shown up-stairs by the invalid's husband, who held the\r\npost of valet to the Duke. The man was a very intelligent fellow, a\r\ncharacter with whom all visitors to Richmond House conversed freely,\r\nand a vehement politician. In this last characteristic the Doctor\r\nresembled him. Slowly the physician and the valet ascended the\r\nstaircase, discussing the fate of parties, and the merits of\r\nministers. They became excited, and declaiming at the top of their\r\nvoices entered the sick room. The valet--forgetful of his marital\r\nduties in the delights of an intellectual contest--poured in a\r\nbroadside of sarcasms, ironical inquiries, and red-hot declamation;\r\nthe doctor--with true English pluck--returning fire, volley for\r\nvolley. The battle lasted for upwards of an hour, when the two\r\ncombatants walked down-stairs, and the man of medicine took his\r\ndeparture. When the doctor arrived at his door, and was stepping from\r\nhis carriage, it flashed across his mind that he had not applied his\r\nfinger to his patient's pulse, or even asked her how she felt herself!\r\n\r\nPrevious to Charles II.'s reign physicians were in the habit of\r\nvisiting their patients on horse-back, sitting sideways on foot-cloths\r\nlike women. Simeon Fox and Dr. Argent were the last Presidents of the\r\nCollege of Physicians to go their rounds in this undignified manner.\r\nWith the \"Restoration\" came the carriage of the London physician. The\r\n_Lex Talionis_ says, \"For there must now be a little coach and two\r\nhorses; and, being thus attended, half-a-piece, their usual fee, is\r\nbut ill-taken, and popped into their left pocket, and possibly may\r\ncause the patient to send for his worship twice before he will come\r\nagain to the hazard of another angel.\"\r\n\r\nThe fashion, once commenced, soon prevailed. In Queen Anne's reign, no\r\nphysician with the slightest pretensions to practice could manage\r\nwithout his chariot and four, sometimes even six, horses. In our own\r\nday an equipage of some sort is considered so necessary an appendage\r\nto a medical practitioner, that a physician without a carriage (or a\r\nfly that can pass muster for one) is looked on with suspicion. He is\r\nmarked down _mauvais sujet_ in the same list with clergymen without\r\nduty, barristers without chambers, and gentlemen whose Irish tenantry\r\nobstinately refuse to keep them supplied with money. On the whole the\r\ncarriage system is a good one. It protects stair carpets from being\r\nsoiled with muddy boots (a great thing!), and bears cruelly on needy\r\naspirants after professional employment (a yet greater thing! and one\r\nthat manifestly ought to be the object of all professional\r\netiquette!). If the early struggles of many fashionable physicians\r\nwere fully and courageously written, we should have some heart-rending\r\nstories of the screwing and scraping and shifts by which their first\r\nequipages were maintained. Who hasn't heard of the darling doctor who\r\ntaught singing under the moustachioed and bearded guise of an Italian\r\nCount, at a young ladies' school at Clapham, in order that he might\r\nmake his daily West-end calls between 3 p. m. and 6 p. m. in a\r\nwell-built brougham drawn by a fiery steed from a livery stable? There\r\nwas one noted case of a young physician who provided himself with the\r\nmeans of figuring in a brougham during the May-fair morning, by\r\ncondescending to the garb and duties of a flyman during the hours of\r\ndarkness. He used the same carriage at both periods of the\r\nfour-and-twenty hours, lolling in it by daylight, and sitting on it by\r\ngaslight. The poor fellow forgetting himself on one occasion, so far\r\nas to jump _in_ when he ought to have jumped _on_, or jump _on_ when\r\nhe ought to have jumped _in_, he published his delicate secret to an\r\nunkind world.\r\n\r\nIt is a rash thing for a young man to start his carriage, unless he is\r\nsure of being able to sustain it for a dozen years. To drop it is sure\r\ndestruction. We remember an ambitious Phaeton of Hospitals who\r\nastonished the world--not only of his profession, but of all\r\nLondon--with an equipage fit for an ambassador--the vehicle and the\r\nsteeds being obtained, like the arms blazoned on his panels, upon\r\ncredit. Six years afterwards he was met by a friend crushing the mud\r\non the Marylebone pavements, and with a characteristic assurance, that\r\neven adversity was unable to deprive him of, said that his health was\r\nso much deranged that his dear friend, Sir James Clarke, had\r\nprescribed continual walking exercise for him as the only means of\r\nrecovering his powers of digestion. His friends--good-natured people,\r\nas friends always are--observed that \"it was a pity Sir James hadn't\r\ngiven him the advice a few years sooner--prevention being better than\r\ncure.\"\r\n\r\nThough physicians began generally to take to carriages in Charles\r\nII.'s reign, it may not be supposed that no doctor of medicine before\r\nthat time experienced the motion of a wheeled carriage. In \"Stowe's\r\nSurvey of London\" one may read:--\r\n\r\n     \"In the year 1563, Dr. Langton, a physician, rid in a car,\r\n     with a gown of damask, lined with velvet, and a coat of\r\n     velvet, and a cap of the same (such, it seems, doctors then\r\n     wore), but having a blue hood pinned over his cap; which was\r\n     (as it seems) a customary mark of guilt. And so came through\r\n     Cheapside on a market-day.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor's offence was one against public morals. He had loved not\r\nwisely--but too well. The same generous weakness has brought learned\r\ndoctors, since Langton's day, into extremely ridiculous positions.\r\n\r\nThe cane, wig, silk coat, stockings, side-saddle, and carriage, of the\r\nold physician have been mentioned. We may not pass over his muff in\r\nsilence. That he might have his hands warm and delicate of touch, and\r\nso be able to discriminate to a nicety the qualities of his patient's\r\narterial pulsations, he made his rounds, in cold weather, holding\r\nbefore him a large fur muff, in which his fingers and fore-arm were\r\nconcealed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nEARLY ENGLISH PHYSICIANS.\r\n\r\n     \"Medicine is a science which hath been, as we have said,\r\n     more professed than laboured, and yet more laboured than\r\n     advanced; the labour having been, in my judgment, rather in\r\n     circle than in progression. For I find much iteration, and\r\n     small progression.\"--Lord Bacon's _Advancement of Learning_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe British doctor, however, does not make his first appearance in\r\nsable dress and full-bottomed wig. Chaucer's physician, who was\r\n\"groundit in Astronomy and Magyk Naturel,\" and whose \"study was but\r\nlytyl in the Bible,\" had a far smarter and more attractive dress.\r\n\r\n    \"In sanguyn and in perse he clad was al,\r\n    Lined with taffata and with sendal.\"\r\n\r\nTaffeta and silk, of crimson and sky-blue colour, must have given an\r\nimposing appearance to this worthy gentleman, who, resembling many\r\nlater doctors in his disuse of the Bible, resembled them also in his\r\nlove of fees.\r\n\r\n    \"And yit he was but esy of dispence,\r\n    He kepte that he won in pestelence;\r\n    For gold in physik is a cordial;\r\n    Therefore he lovede gold in special.\"\r\n\r\nAmongst our more celebrated and learned English physicians was John\r\nPhreas, born about the commencement of the fifteenth century, and\r\neducated at Oxford, where he obtained a fellowship on the foundation\r\nof Balliol College. His M. D. degree he obtained in Padua, and the\r\nlarge fortune he made by the practice of physic was also acquired in\r\nItaly. He was a poet and an accomplished scholar. Some of his epistles\r\nin MS. are still preserved in the Balliol Library and at the Bodleian.\r\nHis translation of Diodorus Siculus, dedicated to Paul II., procured\r\nfor him from that pontiff the fatal gift of an English bishopric. A\r\ndisappointed candidate for the same preferment is said to have\r\npoisoned him before the day appointed for his consecration.\r\n\r\nOf Thomas Linacre, successively physician to Henry VII., Henry VIII.,\r\nEdward VI., and Princess Mary, the memory is still green amongst men.\r\nAt his request, in conjunction with the representations of John\r\nChambre, Fernandus de Victoria, Nicholas Halswell, John Fraunces,\r\nRobert Yaxley (physicians), and Cardinal Wolsey, Henry VIII. granted\r\nletters patent, establishing the College of Physicians, and conferring\r\non its members the sole privilege of practicing, and admitting persons\r\nto practice, within the city, and a circuit of seven miles. The\r\ncollege also was empowered to license practitioners throughout the\r\nkingdom, save such as were graduates of Oxford and Cambridge--who were\r\nto be exempt from the jurisdiction of the new college, save within\r\nLondon and its precincts. Linacre was the first President of the\r\nCollege of Physicians. The meetings of the learned corporation were\r\nheld at Linacre's private house, No. 5, Knight-Rider Street, Doctors'\r\nCommons. This house (on which the Physician's arms, granted by\r\nChristopher Barker, Garter King-at-arms, Sept. 20, 1546, may still be\r\nseen,) was bequeathed to the college by Linacre, and long remained\r\ntheir property and abode. The original charter of the brotherhood\r\nstates: \"Before this period a great multitude of ignorant persons, of\r\nwhom the greater part had no insight into physic, nor into any other\r\nkind of learning--some could not even read the letters and the\r\nbook--so far forth, that common artificers, as smiths, weavers and\r\nwomen, boldly and accustomably took upon them great cures, to the high\r\ndispleasure of God, great infamy of the Faculty, and the grievous\r\nhurt, damage, and destruction of many of the king's liege people.\"\r\n\r\nLinacre died in the October of 1524. Caius, writing his epitaph,\r\nconcludes, \"Fraudes dolosque mire perosus, fidus amicis, omnibus juxta\r\ncharus; aliquot annos antequam obierat Presbyter factus; plenus annes,\r\nex hac vita migravit, multum desideratus.\" His motive for taking holy\r\norders towards the latter part of his life is unknown. Possibly he\r\nimagined the sacerdotal garb would be a secure and comfortable\r\nclothing in the grave. Certainly he was not a profound theologian. A\r\nshort while before his death he read the New Testament for the first\r\ntime, when so great was his astonishment at finding the rules of\r\nChristians widely at variance with their practice, that he threw the\r\nsacred volume from him in a passion, and exclaimed, \"Either this is\r\nnot the gospel, or we are not Christians.\"\r\n\r\nOf the generation next succeeding Linacre's was John Kaye, or Key (or\r\nCaius, as it has been long pedantically spelt). Like Linacre (the\r\nelegant writer and intimate friend of Erasmus), Caius is associated\r\nwith letters not less than medicine. Born of a respectable Norfolk\r\nfamily, Caius raised, on the foundation of Gonvil Hall, the college in\r\nthe University of Cambridge that bears his name--to which Eastern\r\nCounties' men do mostly resort. Those who know Cambridge remember the\r\nquaint humour with which, in obedience to the founder's will, the\r\ngates of Caius are named. As a president of the College of Physicians,\r\nCaius was a zealous defender of the rights of his order. It has been\r\nsuggested that Shakespeare's Dr. Caius, in \"The Merry Wives of\r\nWindsor,\" was produced in resentment towards the president, for his\r\nexcessive fervor against the surgeons.\r\n\r\nCaius terminated his laborious and honourable career on July the 29th,\r\n1573, in the sixty-third year of his age.[2] He was buried in his\r\ncollege chapel, in a tomb constructed some time before his decease,\r\nand marked with the brief epitaph--\"Fui Caius.\" In the same year in\r\nwhich this physician of Edward VI., Mary, and Elizabeth died, was born\r\nTheodore Turquet de Mayerne, Baron Aulbone of France, and Sir Theodore\r\nMayerne in England. Of Mayerne mention will be made in various places\r\nof these pages. There is some difficulty in ascertaining to how many\r\ncrowned heads this lucky courtier was appointed physician. After\r\nleaving France and permanently fixing himself in England, he kept up\r\nhis connection with the French, so that the list of his\r\nmonarch-patients may be said to comprise two French and three English\r\nsovereigns--Henry IV. and Louis XIII. of France, and James I., Charles\r\nI., and Charles II. of England. Mayerne died at Chelsea, in the\r\neighty-second year of his age, on the 15th of March, 1655. Like John\r\nHunter, he was buried in the church of St. Martin's-in-the-Fields. His\r\nlibrary went to the College of Physicians, and his wealth to his only\r\ndaughter, who was married to the Marquis of Montpouvillon. Though\r\nMayerne was the most eminent physician of his time, his prescriptions\r\nshow that his enlightenment was not superior to the prevailing\r\nignorance of the period. He recommended a monthly excess of wine and\r\nfood as a fine stimulant to the system. His treatise on Gout, written\r\nin French, and translated into English (1676) by Charles II.'s\r\nphysician in ordinary, Dr. Thomas Sherley, recommends a clumsy and\r\ninordinate administration of violent drugs. Calomel he habitually\r\nadministered in scruple doses. Sugar of lead he mixed largely in his\r\nconserves; pulverized human bones he was very fond of prescribing; and\r\nthe principal ingredient in his gout-powder was \"raspings of a human\r\nskull unburied.\" But his sweetest compound was his \"Balsam of Bats,\"\r\nstrongly recommended as an unguent for hypochondriacal persons, into\r\nwhich entered adders, bats, suckling whelps, earth-worms, hog's\r\ngrease, the marrow of a stag, and the thigh-bone of an ox. After such\r\na specimen of the doctor's skill, possibly the reader will not care to\r\nstudy his receipts for canine madness, communicated to the Royal\r\nSociety in 1687, or his \"Excellent and well-approved Receipts and\r\nExperiments in Cookery, with the best way of Preserving.\" Nor will the\r\nreader be surprised to learn that the great physician had a firm\r\nbelief in the efficacy of amulets and charms.\r\n\r\n  [2] In Dr. Moussett's \"Health's Improvement; or Rules concerning Food\"\r\n  is a curious passage relating to this eminent physician's decay.\r\n\r\nBut the ignorance and superstition of which Mayerne was the\r\nrepresentative were approaching the close of their career; and Sir\r\nTheodore's court celebrity and splendour were to become contemptible\r\nby the side of the scientific achievements of a contemporary. The\r\ngrave closed over Mayerne in 1655; but in the December of 1652, the\r\nCollege of Physicians had erected in their hall a statue of Harvey,\r\nwho died on the third of June, 1657, aged seventy-nine years.\r\n\r\n    \"The circling streams, once thought but pools of blood\r\n    (Whether life's fuel, or the body's food),\r\n    From dark oblivion Harvey's name shall save.\"\r\n\r\nAubrey says of Harvey--\"He was not tall, but of the lowest stature;\r\nround-faced, olivaster (waintscott) complexion; little eie--round,\r\nvery black, full of spirit; his haire was black as a raven, but quite\r\nwhite twenty years before he dyed. I remember he was wont to drink\r\ncoffee, which he and his brother Eliab did, before coffee-houses were\r\nin fashion in London. He was, as all the rest of his brothers, very\r\ncholerique; and in his younger days wore a dagger (as the fashion then\r\nwas); but this doctor would be apt to draw out his dagger upon every\r\nslight occasion. He rode on _horse-back with a foot-cloath to visit\r\nhis patients, his man following on foot, as the fashion then was, was\r\nvery decent, now quite discontinued_.\"\r\n\r\nHarvey's discovery dates a new era in medical and surgical science.\r\nIts influence on scientific men, not only as a stepping-stone to\r\nfurther discoveries, but as a power rousing in all quarters a spirit\r\nof philosophic investigation, was immediately perceptible. A new class\r\nof students arose, before whom the foolish dreams of medical\r\nsuperstition and the darkness of empiricism slowly disappeared.\r\n\r\nOf the physicians[3] of what may be termed the Elizabethan era, beyond\r\nall others the most sagacious and interesting, is William Bulleyn. He\r\nbelongs to a bevy of distinguished Eastern Counties' physicians. Dr.\r\nButts, Henry VIII.'s physician, mentioned in Strype's \"Life of\r\nCranmer,\" and made celebrated amongst doctors by Shakespeare's \"Henry\r\nthe Eighth,\" belonged to an honourable and gentle family sprinkled\r\nover Norfolk, Suffolk, and Cambridgeshire. The butcher king knighted\r\nhim by the style of William Butts of Norfolk. Caius was born at\r\nNorwich; and the eccentric William Butler, of whom Mayerne, Aubrey,\r\nand Fuller tell fantastic stories, was born at Ipswich, about the year\r\n1535.\r\n\r\n  [3] To the acquirements of the Elizabethan physicians in every\r\n  department of learning, _save_ the sciences immediately concerning\r\n  their own profession, Lord Bacon bears emphatic testimony--\"For you\r\n  shall have of them antiquaries, poets, humanists, statesmen,\r\n  merchants, divines.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam Bulleyn was born in the isle of Ely; but it is with the\r\neastern division of the county of Suffolk that his name is especially\r\nassociated. Sir William Bulleyn, the Sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk\r\nin the fifteenth year of Henry VII., and grandfather of the\r\nunfortunate Anne Boleyn, was one of the magnates of the doctor's\r\nfamily--members of which are still to be found in Ipswich and other\r\nparts of East Anglia, occupying positions of high respectability. In\r\nthe reigns of Edward VI., Mary, and Elizabeth, no one ranked higher\r\nthan William Bulleyn as botanist and physician. The record of his\r\nacuteness and learning is found in his numerous works, which are\r\namongst the most interesting prose writings of the Elizabethan era. If\r\nMr. Bohn, who has already done so much to render old and neglected\r\nauthors popular, would present the public with a well-edited reprint\r\nof Bulleyn's works, he would make a valuable addition to the services\r\nhe has already conferred on literature.\r\n\r\nAfter receiving a preliminary education in the University of\r\nCambridge, Bulleyn enlarged his mind by extended travel, spending much\r\ntime in Germany and Scotland. During the reign of Queen Mary he\r\npracticed in Norwich; but he moved to Blaxhall, in Suffolk (of which\r\nparish it is believed his brother was for some years rector). Alluding\r\nto his wealthy friend, Sir Thomas Rushe, of Oxford, he says, with a\r\npun, \"I myself did know a Rushe, growing in the fenne side, by Orford,\r\nin Suffolke, that might have spent three hundred marks by year. Was\r\nnot this a _rush_ of estimation? A fewe sutche rushes be better than\r\nmany great trees or bushes. But thou doste not know that countrey,\r\nwhere sometyme I did dwell, at a place called Blaxall, neere to that\r\n_Rushe Bushe_. I would all rushes within this realme were as riche in\r\nvalue.\" (The ancient family still maintain their connection with the\r\ncounty.) Speaking of the rushes near Orford, in Suffolk, and about the\r\nisle of Ely, Bulleyn says, \"The playne people make mattes and\r\nhorse-collars of the greater rushes, and of the smaller they make\r\nlightes or candles for the winter. Rushes that growe upon dry groundes\r\nbe good to strewe in halles, chambers, and galleries, to walk\r\nupon--defending apparell, as traynes of gownes and kirtles, from the\r\ndust.\"\r\n\r\nHe tells of the virtues of Suffolk sage (a herb that the nurses of\r\nthat county still believe in as having miraculous effects, when\r\nadministered in the form of \"sage-tea\"). Of Suffolk hops (now but\r\nlittle grown in the county) he mentions in terms of high\r\npraise--especially of those grown round Framlingham Castle, and \"the\r\nlate house of nunnes at Briziarde.\" \"I know in many places of the\r\ncountry of Suffolke, where they brew theyr beere with hoppes that\r\ngrowe upon theyr owne groundes, as in a place called Briziarde, near\r\nan old famous castle called Framingham, and in many other places of\r\nthe country.\" Of the peas of Orford the following mention is\r\nmade:--\"In a place called Orforde, in Suffolke, betwene the haven and\r\nthe mayne sea, wheras never plow came, nor natural earth was, but\r\nstones onely, infinite thousand ships loden in that place, there did\r\npease grow, whose roots were more than iii fadome long, and the coddes\r\ndid grow uppon clusters like the keys of ashe trees, bigger than\r\nfitches, and less than the fyeld peason, very sweete to eat upon, and\r\nserved many pore people dwelling there at hand, which els should have\r\nperished for honger, the scarcity of bread was so great. In so much\r\nthat the playne pore people did make very much of akornes; and a\r\nsickness of a strong fever did sore molest the commons that yere, the\r\nlike whereof was never heard of there. Now, whether th' occasion of\r\nthese peason, in providence of God, came through some shipwracke with\r\nmuch misery, or els by miracle, I am not able to determine thereof;\r\nbut sowen by man's hand they were not, nor like other pease.\"[4]\r\n\r\n  [4] The tradition of this timely and unaccountable growth of peas\r\n  still exists amongst the peasants in the neighbourhood of Orford. J.\r\n  C. J.\r\n\r\nIn the same way one has in the Doctor's \"Book of Simples\" pleasant\r\ngossip about the more choice productions of the garden and of\r\ncommerce, showing that horticulture must have been far more advanced\r\nat that time than is generally supposed, and that the luxuries\r\nimported from foreign countries were largely consumed throughout the\r\ncountry. Pears, apples, peaches, quinces, cherries, grapes, raisins,\r\nprunes, barberries, oranges, medlars, raspberries and strawberries,\r\nspinage, ginger, and lettuces are the good things thrown upon the\r\nboard.\r\n\r\nOf pears, the author says: \"There is a kynd of peares growing in the\r\ncity of Norwich, called the black freere's peare, very delicious and\r\npleasaunt, and no lesse profitable unto a hoate stomacke, as I heard\r\nit reported by a ryght worshipful phisicion of the same city, called\r\nDoctour Manfield.\" Other pears, too, are mentioned, \"sutch as have\r\nnames as peare Robert, peare John, bishop's blessyngs, with other\r\nprety names. The red warden is of greate vertue, conserved, roasted\r\nor baken to quench choller.\" The varieties of the apple especially\r\nmentioned are \"the costardes, the greene cotes, the pippen, the queene\r\naple.\"\r\n\r\nGrapes are spoken of as cultivated and brought to a high state of\r\nperfection in Suffolk and other parts of the country. Hemp is\r\nhumorously called \"gallow grasse or neckweede.\" The heartesease, or\r\npaunsie, is mentioned by its quaint old name, \"three faces in one\r\nhodde.\" Parsnips, radishes, and carrots are offered for sale. In the\r\nneighborhood of London, large quantities of these vegetables were\r\ngrown for the London market; but Bulleyn thinks little of them,\r\ndescribing them as \"more plentiful than profytable.\" Of figs--\"Figges\r\nbe good agaynst melancholy, and the falling evil, to be eaten. Figges,\r\nnuts, and herb grace do make a sufficient medicine against poison or\r\nthe pestilence. Figges make a good gargarism to cleanse the throates.\"\r\n\r\nThe double daisy is mentioned as growing in gardens. Daisy tea was\r\nemployed in gout and rheumatism--as herb tea of various sorts still is\r\nby the poor of our provinces. With daisy tea (or _bellis-tea_) \"I,\r\nBulleyn, did recover one Belliser, not onely from a spice of the\r\npalsie, but also from the quartan. And afterwards, the same Belliser,\r\nmore unnatural than a viper, sought divers ways to have murthered me,\r\ntaking part against me with my mortal enemies, accompanied with bloudy\r\nruffins for that bloudy purpose.\" Parsley, also, was much used in\r\nmedicine. And as it was the custom for the doctor to grow his own\r\nherbs in his garden, we may here see the origin of the old nursery\r\ntradition of little babies being brought by the doctor from the\r\nparsley bed.[5]\r\n\r\n  [5] The classical reader who is acquainted with the significations of\r\n  the Greek ???????, will not be at a loss to account for this\r\n  medicinal use of the crisp green leaves.\r\n\r\nScarcely less interesting than \"The Book of Simples\" is Bulleyn's\r\n\"Dialogue betweene Soarenes and Chirurgi.\" It opens with an honourable\r\nmention of many distinguished physicians and chirurgians. Dr. John\r\nKaius is praised as a worthy follower of Linacre. Dr. Turner's \"booke\r\nof herbes will always grow greene.\" Sir Thomas Eliot's \"'castel of\r\nhealth' cannot decay.\" Thomas Faire \"is not deade, but is transformed\r\nand chaunged into a new nature immortal.\" Androwe Borde, the father of\r\n\"Merry Andrews,\" \"wrote also wel of physicke to profit the common\r\nwealth withal.\" Thomas Pannel, the translator of the Schola\r\nSaternitana, \"hath play'd ye good servant to the commonwealth in\r\ntranslating good bookes of physicke.\" Dr. William Kunyngham \"hath wel\r\ntravailed like a good souldiour agaynst the ignorant enemy.\" Numerous\r\nother less eminent practitioners are mentioned--such as Buns, Edwards,\r\nHatcher, Frere, Langton, Lorkin, Wendy--educated at Cambridge; Gee and\r\nSimon Ludford, of Oxford; Huyck (the Queen's physician), Bartley,\r\nCarr; Masters, John Porter, of Norwich; Edmunds of York, Robert\r\nBaltrop, and Thomas Calfe, apothecary.\r\n\r\n\"Soft chirurgians,\" says Bulleyn, \"make foul sores.\" He was a bold and\r\ncourageous one. \"Where the wound is,\" runs the Philippine proverb,\r\n\"the plaster must be.\" Bulleyn was of the same opinion; but, in\r\ndressing a tender part, the surgeon is directed to have \"a gladsome\r\ncountenance,\" because \"the paciente should not be greatly troubled.\"\r\nFor bad surgeons he has not less hostility than he has for\r\n\r\n        \"Petty Foggers, in cases of the law,\r\n    Who make mountaynes of molhils, and trees of a straw.\"\r\n\r\nThe state of medicine in Elizabeth's reign may be discovered by a\r\nsurvey of the best recipes of this physician, who, in sagacity and\r\nlearning, was far superior to Sir Theodore Mayerne, his successor by a\r\nlong interval.\r\n\r\n\"_An Embrocation._--An embrocation is made after this manner:--?.\r\nOf a decoction of mallowes, vyolets, barly, quince seed, lettice\r\nleaves, one pint; of barly meale, two ounces; of oyle of vyolets and\r\nroses, of each, an ounce and half; of butter, one ounce; and then\r\nseeth them all together till they be like a broathe, puttyng thereto,\r\nat the ende, four yolkes of eggs; and the maner of applying them is\r\nwith peeces of cloth, dipped in the aforesaid decoction, being\r\nactually hoate.\"\r\n\r\n\"_A Good Emplaster._--You shall mak a plaster with these medicines\r\nfollowing, which the great learned men themselves have used unto their\r\npacientes:--?.

Make your\r\nelectuary with honey emblici, which is the fourth kind of mirobalans\r\nwith roses, strained in equall partes, as much as will suffice. This\r\nhealeth cold diseases of ye braine, harte, stomack. It is a medicine\r\nproved against the tremblynge of the harte, faynting and souning, the\r\nweaknes of the stomacke, pensivenes, solitarines. Kings and noble men\r\nhave used this for their comfort. It causeth them to be bold-spirited,\r\nthe body to smell wel, and ingendreth to the face good coloure.\"\r\n\r\nTruly a medicine for kings and noblemen! During the railway panic in\r\n'46 an unfortunate physician prescribed for a nervous lady:--\r\n\r\n    ?. Great Western, 350 shares.\r\n    Eastern Counties}\r\n    North Middlesex } a--a 1050\r\n    Mft. Haust. 1. Om. noc. cap.\r\n\r\nThis direction to a delicate gentlewoman, to swallow nightly two\r\nthousand four hundred and fifty railway shares, was regarded as\r\nevidence of the physician's insanity, and the management of his\r\nprivate affairs was forthwith taken out of his hands. But assuredly it\r\nwas as rational a prescription as Bulleyn's \"Electuarium de Gemmis.\"\r\n\r\n\"_A Precious Water._--Take nutmegges, the roote called doronike, which\r\nthe apothecaries have, setwall, gatangall, mastike, long peper, the\r\nbark of pomecitron, of mellon, sage, bazel, marjorum, dill, spiknard,\r\nwood of aloes, cubebe, cardamon, called graynes of paradise, lavender,\r\npeniroyall, mintes, sweet catamus, germander, enulacampana, rosemary,\r\nstichados, and quinance, of eche lyke quantity; saffron, an ounce and\r\nhalf; the bone of a harte's heart grated, cut, and stamped; and beate\r\nyour spyces grossly in a morter. Put in ambergrice and musk, of each\r\nhalf a drachm. Distil this in a simple aqua vitæ, made with strong\r\nale, or sackeleyes and aniseedes, not in a common styll, but in a\r\nserpentine; to tell the vertue of this water against colde, phlegme,\r\ndropsy, heavines of minde, comming of melancholy, I cannot well at\r\nthys present, the excellent virtues thereof are sutch, and also the\r\ntyme were to long.\"\r\n\r\nThe cure of cancers has been pretended and attempted by a numerous\r\ntrain of knaves and simpletons, as well as men of science. In the\r\nElizabethan time this most terrible of maladies was thought to be\r\ninfluenced by certain precious waters--_i. e._ precious messes.\r\n\r\n\"Many good men and women,\" says Bulleyn, \"wythin thys realme have\r\ndyvers and sundry medicines for the canker, and do help their\r\nneighboures that bee in perill and daunger whyche be not onely poore\r\nand needy, having no money to spende in chirurgie. But some do well\r\nwhere no chirurgians be neere at hand; in such cases, as I have said,\r\nmany good gentlemen and ladyes have done no small pleasure to poore\r\npeople; as that excellent knyght, and worthy learned man, Syr Thomas\r\nEliot, whose works be immortall. Syr William Parris, of\r\nCambridgeshire, whose cures deserve prayse; Syr William Gascoigne, of\r\nYorkshire, that helped many soare eyen; and the Lady Tailor, of\r\nHuntingdonshire, and the Lady Darrell of Kent, had many precious\r\nmedicines to comfort the sight, and to heale woundes withal, and were\r\nwell seene in herbes.\r\n\r\n\"The commonwealth hath great want of them, and of theyr medicines,\r\nwhych if they had come into my handes, they should have bin written in\r\nmy booke. Among al other there was a knight, a man of great worshyp, a\r\nGodly hurtlesse gentleman, which is departed thys lyfe, hys name is\r\nSyr Anthony Heveningham. This gentleman learned a water to kyll a\r\ncanker of hys owne mother, whych he used all hys lyfe, to the greate\r\nhelpe of many men, women, and chyldren.\"\r\n\r\nThis water \"learned by Syr Anthony Heveningham\" was, Bulleyn states on\r\nreport, composed thus:--\r\n\r\n\"_Precious Water to Cure a Canker_:--Take dove's foote, a herbe so\r\nnamed, Arkangell ivy wyth the berries, young red bryer toppes, and\r\nleaves, whyte roses, theyr leaves and buds, red sage, selandyne, and\r\nwoodbynde, of eche lyke quantity, cut or chopped and put into pure\r\ncleane whyte wyne, and clarified hony. Then breake into it alum glasse\r\nand put in a little of the pouder of aloes hepatica. Destill these\r\ntogether softly in a limbecke of glasse or pure tin; if not, then in\r\nlimbecke wherein aqua vitæ is made. Keep this water close. It will not\r\nonely kyll the canker, if it be duly washed therewyth; but also two\r\ndroppes dayly put into the eye wyll sharp the syght, and breake the\r\npearle and spottes, specially if it be dropped in with a little fenell\r\nwater, and close the eys after.\"\r\n\r\nThere is reason to wish that all empirical applications, for the cure\r\nof cancer, were as harmless as this.\r\n\r\nThe following prescription for pomatum differs but little from the\r\ncommon domestic receipts for lip-salve in use at the present day:--\r\n\r\n\"_Sickness._--How make you pomatum?\r\n\r\n\"_Health._--Take the fat of a young kyd one pound, temper it with the\r\nwater of musk roses by the space of foure dayes; then take five\r\napples, and dresse them, and cut them in pieces, and lard them with\r\ncloves, then boyle them altogeather in the same water of roses, in one\r\nvessel of glasse; set within another vessel; let it boyle on the fyre\r\nso long until all be white; then wash them with ye same water of muske\r\nroses; this done, kepe it in a glass; and if you wil have it to smel\r\nbetter, then you must put in a little civet or musk, or of them both,\r\nand ambergrice. Gentilwomen doe use this to make theyr faces smoth and\r\nfayre, for it healeth cliftes in the lyppes, or in any other place of\r\nthe hands and face.\"\r\n\r\nThe most laughable of all Bulleyn's receipts is one in which, for the\r\ncure of a child suffering under a certain nervous malady, he\r\nprescribes \"a smal yong mouse rosted.\" To some a \"rosted mouse\" may\r\nseem more palatable than the compound in which snails are the\r\nprincipal ingredient. \"Snayles,\" says Bulleyn, \"broken from the\r\nshelles and sodden in whyte wyne with oyle and sugar are very holsome,\r\nbecause they be hoat and moist for the straightnes of the lungs and\r\ncold cough. Snails stamped with camphory, and leven wil draw forth\r\nprycks in the flesh.\" So long did this belief in the virtue of snails\r\nretain its hold on Suffolk, that the writer of these pages remembers a\r\nvenerable lady (whose memory is cherished for her unostentatious\r\nbenevolence and rare worth) who for years daily took a cup of snail\r\nbroth, for the benefit of a weak chest.\r\n\r\nOne minor feature of Bulleyn's works is the number of receipts given\r\nin them for curing the bites of mad dogs. The good man's horror of\r\nSuffolk witches is equal to his admiration of Suffolk dairies. Of the\r\nformer he says, \"I dyd know wythin these few yeres a false witch,\r\ncalled M. Line, in a towne of Suffolke called Derham, which with a\r\npayre of ebene beades, and certain charmes, had no small resort of\r\nfoolysh women, when theyr chyldren were syck. To thys lame wytch they\r\nresorted, to have the fairie charmed and the spyrite conjured away;\r\nthrough the prayers of the ebene beades, whych she said came from the\r\nHoly Land, and were sanctifyed at Rome. Through whom many goodly cures\r\nwere don, but my chaunce was to burn ye said beades. Oh that damnable\r\nwitches be suffred to live unpunished and so many blessed men burned;\r\nwitches be more hurtful in this realm than either quarten or\r\npestilence. I know in a towne called Kelshall in Suffolke, a witch,\r\nwhose name was M. Didge, who with certain _Ave Marias_ upon her ebene\r\nbeades, and a waxe candle, used this charme for S. Anthonies fyre,\r\nhaving the sycke body before her, holding up her hande, saying--\r\n\r\n    'There came two angels out of the North-east,\r\n    One brought fyre, the other brought frost,--\r\n        Out fyre, and in frost!'\r\n\r\n\"I could reherse an hundred of sutch knackes, of these holy gossips.\r\nThe fyre take them all, for they be God's enemyes.\"\r\n\r\nOn leaving Blaxhall in Suffolk, Bulleyn migrated to the north. For\r\nmany years he practised with success at Durham. At Shields he owned a\r\nconsiderable property. Sir Thomas, Baron of Hilton, Commander of\r\nTinmouth Castle under Philip and Mary, was his patron and intimate\r\nfriend. His first book, entitled \"Government of Health,\" he dedicated\r\nto Sir Thomas Hilton; but the MS., unfortunately, was lost in a\r\nshipwreck before it was printed. Disheartened by this loss, and the\r\ndeath of his patron, Bulleyn bravely set to work in London, to \"revive\r\nhis dead book.\" Whilst engaged on the laborious work of recomposition,\r\nhe was arraigned on a grave charge of murder. \"One William Hilton,\" he\r\nsays, telling his own story, \"brother to the sayd Syr Thomas Hilton,\r\naccused me of no less cryme then of most cruel murder of his owne\r\nbrother, who dyed of a fever (sent onely of God) among his owne\r\nfrends, fynishing his lyfe in the Christian fayth. But this William\r\nHilton caused me to be arraigned before that noble Prince, the Duke's\r\nGrace of Norfolke, for the same; to this end to have had me dyed\r\nshamefully; that with the covetous Ahab he might have, through false\r\nwitnes and perjury, obtayned by the counsel of Jezabell, a wineyard,\r\nby the pryce of blood. But it is wrytten, _Testis mendax peribit_, a\r\nfals witnes shal com to naught; his wicked practise was wisely espyed,\r\nhis folly deryded, his bloudy purpose letted, and fynallye I was with\r\njustice delivered.\"\r\n\r\nThis occurred in 1560. His foiled enemy afterwards endeavoured to get\r\nhim assassinated; but he again triumphed over the machinations of his\r\nadversary. Settling in London, he obtained a large practice, though he\r\nwas never enrolled amongst the physicians of the college. His leisure\r\ntime he devoted to the composition of his excellent works. To the last\r\nhe seems to have kept up a close connection with the leading Eastern\r\nCounties families. His \"Comfortable Regiment and Very Wholsome order\r\nagainst the moste perilous Pleurisie,\" was dedicated to the Right\r\nWorshipful Sir Robart Wingfelde of Lethryngham, Knight.\r\n\r\nWilliam Bulleyn died in London, on the 7th of January, 1576, and was\r\nburied in the church of St. Giles's, Cripplegate, in the same tomb\r\nwherein his brother Richard had been laid thirteen years before; and\r\nwherein John Fox, the martyrologist, was interred eleven years later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nSIR THOMAS BROWNE AND SIR KENELM DIGBY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmongst the physicians of the seventeenth century were three\r\nBrownes--father, son, and grandson. The father wrote the \"Religio\r\nMedici,\" and the \"Pseudoxia Epidemica\"--a treatise on vulgar errors.\r\nThe son was the traveller, and author of \"Travels in Hungaria, Servia,\r\nBulgaria, Macedonia, Thessaly, Austria, Styria, Carinthia, Carniola,\r\nFriuli &c.,\" and the translator of the Life of Themistocles in the\r\nEnglish version of \"Plutarch's Lives\" undertaken by Dryden. He was\r\nalso a physician of Bartholomew's, and a favourite physician of\r\nCharles II., who on one occasion said of him, \"Doctor Browne is as\r\nlearned as any of the college, and as well bred as any of the court.\"\r\nThe grandson was a Fellow of the Royal Society, and, like his father\r\nand grandfather, a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians; but he\r\nwas by no means worthy of his distinguished progenitors. Alike unknown\r\nin literature, science, and art, he was a miserable sot, and was\r\nkilled by a fall from his horse, between Southfleet and Gravesend,\r\nwhen in a state of intoxication. He was thus cut off in the July of\r\n1710, having survived his father not quite two years.\r\n\r\nThe author of the \"Religio Medici\" enjoys as good a chance of an\r\nimmortality of fame as any of his contemporaries. The child of a\r\nLondon merchant, who left him a comfortable fortune, Thomas Browne was\r\nfrom the beginning of his life (Oct. 19, 1605) to its close (Oct. 19,\r\n1682), well placed amongst the wealthier of those who occupied the\r\nmiddle way of life. From Winchester College, where his schoolboy days\r\nwere spent, he proceeded to the University of Oxford, becoming a\r\nmember of Broadgates Hall, i.e., Pembroke College--the college of\r\nBlackstone, Shenstone, and Samuel Johnson. After taking his B.A. and\r\nM.A. degrees, he turned his attention to medicine, and for some time\r\npractised as a physician in Oxfordshire. Subsequently to this he\r\ntravelled over different parts of Europe, visiting France, Italy, and\r\nHolland, and taking a degree of Doctor in Physic at Leyden. Returning\r\nto England, he settled at Norwich, married a rich and beautiful\r\nNorfolk lady, named Mileham; and for the rest of his days resided in\r\nthat ancient city, industriously occupied with an extensive practice,\r\nthe pursuits of literature, and the education of his children. When\r\nCharles II. visited Norwich in 1671, Thomas Browne, M.D., was knighted\r\nby the royal hand. This honour, little as a man of letters would now\r\nesteem it, was highly prized by the philosopher. He thus alludes to it\r\nin his \"Antiquities of Norwich\"--\"And it is not for some wonder, that\r\nNorwich having been for so long a time so considerable a place, so few\r\nkings have visited it; of which number among so many monarchs since\r\nthe Conquest we find but four; viz., King Henry III., Edward I.,\r\nQueen Elizabeth, and our gracious sovereign now reigning, King Charles\r\nII., of which I had a particular reason to take notice.\"\r\n\r\nAmongst the Norfolk people Sir Thomas was very popular, his suave and\r\nunobtrusive manners securing him many friends, and his philosophic\r\nmoderation of temper saving him from ever making an enemy. The honour\r\nconferred on him was a subject of congratulation--even amongst his\r\npersonal friends, when his back was turned. The Rev. John Whitefoot,\r\nM.A., Rector of Heigham, in Norfolk, in his \"Minutes for the Life of\r\nSir Thomas Browne,\" says, that had it been his province to preach his\r\nfuneral sermon, he should have taken his text from an uncanonical\r\nbook--\"I mean that of Syracides, or Jesus, the son of Syrach, commonly\r\ncalled Ecclesiasticus, which, in the 38th chapter, and the first\r\nverse, hath these words, 'Honour a physician with the honour due unto\r\nhim; for the uses which you may have of him, for the Lord hath created\r\nhim; for of the Most High cometh healing, and he shall receive Honour\r\nof the King' (as ours did that of knighthood from the present King,\r\nwhen he was in this city). 'The skill of the physician shall lift up\r\nhis head, and in the sight of great men shall he be in admiration'; so\r\nwas this worthy person by the greatest man of this nation that ever\r\ncame into this country, by whom also he was frequently and personally\r\nvisited.\"\r\n\r\nWidely and accurately read in ancient and modern literature, and\r\npossessed of numerous accomplishments, Sir Thomas Browne was in\r\nsociety diffident almost to shyness. \"His modesty,\" says Whitefoot,\r\n\"was visible in a natural habitual blush, which was increased upon the\r\nleast occasion, and oft discovered without any observable cause. Those\r\nwho knew him only by the briskness of his writings were astonished at\r\nhis gravity of aspect and countenance, and freedom from loquacity.\" As\r\nwas his manner, so was his dress. \"In his habit of cloathing he had an\r\naversion to all finery, and affected plainness both in fashion and\r\nornaments.\"\r\n\r\nThe monuments of Sir Thomas and his lady are in the church of St.\r\nPeter's, Mancroft, Norwich, where they were buried. Some years since\r\nSir Thomas Browne's tomb was opened for the purpose of submitting it\r\nto repair, when there was discovered on his coffin a plate, of which\r\nDr. Diamond, who happened at the time to be in Norwich, took two\r\nrubbings, one of which is at present in the writer's custody. It bears\r\nthe following interesting inscription:--\"Amplissimus vir Dr. Thomas\r\nBrowne Miles Medicinæ Dr. Annos Natus et Denatus 19 Die Mensis Anno\r\nDmi., 1682--hoc loculo indormiens corporis spagyrici pulvere plumbum\r\nin aurum convertit.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Religio Medici\" not only created an unprecedented sensation by\r\nits erudition and polished style, but it shocked the nervous guardians\r\nof orthodoxy by its boldness of inquiry. It was assailed for its\r\ninfidelity and scientific heresies. According to Coleridge's view of\r\nthe \"Religio Medici,\" Sir Thomas Browne, \"a fine mixture of humourist,\r\ngenius, and pedant,\" was a Spinosist without knowing it. \"Had he,\"\r\nsays the poet, \"lived nowadays, he would probably have been a very\r\ningenious and bold infidel in his real opinions, though the kindness\r\nof his nature would have kept him aloof from vulgar, prating,\r\nobtrusive infidelity.\"\r\n\r\nAmongst the adverse critics of the \"Religio Medici\" was the eccentric,\r\ngallant, brave, credulous, persevering, frivolous, Sir Kenelm Digby. A\r\nMæcenas, a Sir Philip Sydney, a Dr. Dee, a Beau Fielding, and a Dr.\r\nKitchener, all in one, this man is chief of those extravagant\r\ncharacters that astonish the world at rare intervals, and are found\r\nnowhere except in actual life. No novelist of the most advanced\r\nsection of the idealistic school would dare to create such a personage\r\nas Sir Kenelm. The eldest son of the ill-fated Sir Everard Digby, he\r\nwas scarcely three years old when his father atoned on the scaffold\r\nfor his share in the gunpowder treason. Fortunately a portion of the\r\nfamily estate was entailed, so Sir Kenelm, although the offspring of\r\nattainted blood, succeeded to an ample revenue of about £3000 a-year.\r\nIn 1618 (when only in his fifteenth year) he entered Gloucester Hall,\r\nnow Worcester College, Oxford. In 1621 he commenced foreign travel. He\r\nattended Charles I. (then Prince of Wales) at the Court of Madrid; and\r\nreturning to England in 1623, was knighted by James I. at\r\nHinchinbroke, the house of Lord Montague, on the 23rd of October in\r\nthat year. From that period he was before the world as courtier, cook,\r\nlover, warrior, alchemist, political intriguer, and man of letters. He\r\nbecame a gentleman of the bedchamber, and commissioner of the navy. In\r\n1628 he obtained a naval command, and made his brilliant expedition\r\nagainst the Venetians and Algerians, whose galleys he routed off\r\nScanderon. This achievement is celebrated by his client and friend,\r\nBen Jonson:--\r\n\r\n    \"Though, happy Muse, thou know my Digby well,\r\n    Yet read in him these lines: he doth excel\r\n    In honour, courtesy, and all the parts\r\n    Court can call hero, or man could call his arts.\r\n    He's prudent, valiant, just, and temperate;\r\n    In him all virtue is beheld in state;\r\n    And he is built like some imperial room\r\n    For that to dwell in, and be still at home.\r\n    His breast is a brave palace, a broad street,\r\n    Where all heroic, ample thoughts do meet;\r\n    Where nature such a large survey hath ta'en,\r\n    As other souls, to his, dwelt in a lane:\r\n    Witness his action done at Scanderoon\r\n    Upon his birthday, the eleventh of June.\"\r\n\r\nReturning from war, he became once more the student, presenting in\r\n1632 the library he had purchased of his friend Allen, to the Bodleian\r\nLibrary, and devoting his powers to the mastery of controversial\r\ndivinity. Having in 1636 entered the Church of Rome, he resided for\r\nsome time abroad. Amongst his works at this period were his\r\n\"Conference with a Lady about the Choice of Religion,\" published in\r\n1638, and his \"Letters between Lord George Digby and Sir Kenelm Digby,\r\nKnt., concerning Religion,\" not published till 1651. It is difficult\r\nto say to which he was most devoted--his King, his Church, literature,\r\nor his beautiful and frail wife, Venetia Stanley, whose charms\r\nfascinated the many admirers on whom she distributed her favours, and\r\ngained her Sir Kenelm for a husband when she was the discarded\r\nmistress of Richard, Earl of Dorset. She had borne the Earl children,\r\nso his Lordship on parting settled on her an annuity of £500 per\r\nannum. After her marriage, this annuity not being punctually paid, Sir\r\nKenelm sued the Earl for it. Well might Mr. Lodge say, \"By the\r\nfrailties of that lady much of the noblest blood of England was\r\ndishonoured, for she was the daughter of Sir Edward Stanley, Knight\r\nof the Bath, grandson of the great Edward, Earl of Derby, by Lucy,\r\ndaughter and co-heir of Thomas Percy, Earl of Northumberland.\" Such\r\nwas her unfair fame. \"The _fair fame_ left to Posterity of that Truly\r\nNoble Lady, the Lady Venetia Digby, late wife of Sir Kenelm Digby,\r\nKnight, a Gentleman Absolute in all Numbers,\" is embalmed in the clear\r\nverses of Jonson. Like Helen, she is preserved to us by the sacred\r\npoet.\r\n\r\n    \"Draw first a cloud, all save her neck,\r\n    And out of that make day to break;\r\n    Till like her face it do appear,\r\n    And men may think all light rose there.\"\r\n\r\nIn other and more passionate terms Sir Kenelm painted the same charms\r\nin his \"Private Memoirs.\"\r\n\r\nBut if Sir Kenelm was a chivalric husband, he was not a less loyal\r\nsubject. How he avenged in France the honour of his King, on the body\r\nof a French nobleman, may be learnt in a curious tract, \"Sir Kenelme\r\nDigby's Honour Maintained. By a most courageous combat which he fought\r\nwith Lord Mount le Ros, who by base and slanderous words reviled our\r\nKing. Also the true relation how he went to the King of France, who\r\nkindly intreated him, and sent two hundred men to guard him so far as\r\nFlanders. And now he is returned from Banishment, and to his eternall\r\nhonour lives in England.\"\r\n\r\nSir Kenelm's \"Observations upon Religio Medici,\" are properly\r\ncharacterized by Coleridge as those of a pedant. They were written\r\nwhilst he was kept a prisoner, by order of the Parliament, in\r\nWinchester House; and the author had the ludicrous folly to assert\r\nthat he both read the \"Religio Medici\" through for the first time,\r\nand wrote his bulky criticism upon it, in less than twenty-four hours.\r\nOf all the claims that have been advanced by authors for the\r\nreputation of being rapid workmen, this is perhaps the most audacious.\r\nFor not only was the task one that at least would require a month, but\r\nthe impudent assertion that it was accomplished in less than a day and\r\nnight was contradicted by the title-page, in which \"the observations\"\r\nare described as \"occasionally written.\" Beckford's vanity induced him\r\nto boast that \"Vathek\" was composed at one sitting of two days and\r\nthree nights; but this statement--outrageous falsehood though it\r\nbe--was sober truth compared with Sir Kenelm's brag.\r\n\r\nBut of all Sir Kenelm's vagaries, his Sympathetic Powder was the\r\ndrollest. The composition, revealed after the Knight's death by his\r\nchemist and steward, George Hartman, was effected in the following\r\nmanner:--English vitriol was dissolved in warm water; this solution\r\nwas filtered, and then evaporated till a thin scum appeared on the\r\nsurface. It was then left undisturbed and closely covered in a cool\r\nplace for two or three days, when fair, green, and large crystals were\r\nevolved. \"Spread these crystals,\" continues the chemist, \"abroad in a\r\nlarge flat earthen dish, and expose them to the heat of the sun in the\r\ndog-days, turning them often, and the sun will calcine them white;\r\nwhen you see them all white without, beat them grossly, and expose\r\nthem again to the sun, securing them from the rain; when they are well\r\ncalcined, powder them finely, and expose this powder again to the sun,\r\nturning and stirring it often. Continue this until it be reduced to a\r\nwhite powder, which put up in a glass, and tye it up close, and keep\r\nit in a dry place.\"\r\n\r\nThe virtues of this powder were unfolded by Sir Kenelm, in a French\r\noration delivered to \"a solemn assembly of Nobles and Learned Men at\r\nMontpellier, in France.\" It cured wounds in the following manner:--If\r\nany piece of a wounded person's apparel, having on it the stain of\r\nblood that had proceeded from the wound, was dipped in water holding\r\nin solution some of this sympathetic powder, the wound of the injured\r\nperson would forthwith commence a healing process. It mattered not how\r\nfar distant the sufferer was from the scene of operation. Sir Kenelm\r\ngravely related the case of his friend Mr. James Howel, the author of\r\nthe \"Dendrologia,\" translated into French by Mons. Baudoin. Coming\r\naccidentally on two of his friends whilst they were fighting a duel\r\nwith swords, Howel endeavoured to separate them by grasping hold of\r\ntheir weapons. The result of this interference was to show the perils\r\nthat\r\n\r\n                            \"Environ\r\n    The man who meddles with cold iron.\"\r\n\r\nHis hands were severely cut, insomuch that some four or five days\r\nafterwards, when he called on Sir Kenelm, with his wounds plastered\r\nand bandaged up, he said his surgeons feared the supervention of\r\ngangrene. At Sir Kenelm's request, he gave the knight a garter which\r\nwas stained with his blood. Sir Kenelm took it, and without saying\r\nwhat he was about to do, dipped it in a solution of his powder of\r\nvitriol. Instantly the sufferer started.\r\n\r\n\"What ails you?\" cried Sir Kenelm.\r\n\r\n\"I know not what ails me,\" was the answer; \"but I find that I feel no\r\nmore pain. Methinks that a pleasing kind of freshnesse, as it were a\r\ncold napkin, did spread over my hand, which hath taken away the\r\ninflammation that tormented me before.\"\r\n\r\n\"Since that you feel,\" rejoined Sir Kenelm, \"already so good an effect\r\nof my medicament, I advise you to cast away all your plaisters. Only\r\nkeep the wound clean, and in moderate temper 'twixt heat and cold.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Howel went away, sounding the praises of his physician; and the\r\nDuke of Buckingham, hearing what had taken place, hastened to Sir\r\nKenelm's house to talk about it. The Duke and Knight dined together;\r\nwhen, after dinner, the latter, to show his guest the wondrous power\r\nof his powder, took the garter out of the solution, and dried it\r\nbefore the fire. Scarcely was it dry, when Mr. Howel's servant ran in\r\nto say that his master's hand was worse than ever--burning hot, as if\r\n\"it were betwixt coales of fire.\" The messenger was dismissed with the\r\nassurance that ere he reached home his master would be comfortable\r\nagain. On the man retiring, Sir Kenelm put the garter back into the\r\nsolution--the result of which was instant relief to Mr. Howel. In six\r\ndays the wounds were entirely healed. This remarkable case occurred in\r\nLondon, during the reign of James the First. \"King James,\" says Sir\r\nKenelm, \"required a punctuall information of what had passed touching\r\nthis cure; and, after it was done and perfected, his Majesty would\r\nneeds know of me how it was done--having drolled with me first (which\r\nhe could do with a very good grace) about a magician and sorcerer.\" On\r\nthe promise of inviolable secrecy, Sir Kenelm communicated the secret\r\nto his Majesty; \"whereupon his Majesty made sundry proofs, whence he\r\nreceived singular satisfaction.\"\r\n\r\nThe secret was also communicated by Sir Kenelm to Mayerne, through\r\nwhom it was imparted to the Duke of Mayerne--\"a long time his friend\r\nand protector.\" After the Duke's death, his surgeon communicated it to\r\ndivers people of quality; so that, ere long, every country-barber was\r\nfamiliar with the discovery. The mention made of Mayerne in the\r\nlecture is interesting, as it settles a point on which Dr. Aikin had\r\nno information; viz.,--Whether Sir Theodore's Barony of Aubonne was\r\nhereditary or acquired? Sir Kenelm says, \"A little while after the\r\nDoctor went to France, to see some fair territories that he had\r\npurchased near Geneva, which was the Barony of Aubonne.\"\r\n\r\nFor a time the Sympathetic Powder was very generally believed in; and\r\nit doubtless did as much good as harm, by inducing people to throw\r\nfrom their wounds the abominable messes of grease and irritants which\r\nwere then honoured with the name of plaisters. \"What is this?\" asked\r\nAbernethy, when about to examine a patient with a pulsating tumour,\r\nthat was pretty clearly an aneurism.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! that is a plaister,\" said the family doctor.\r\n\r\n\"Pooh!\" said Abernethy, taking it off, and pitching it aside.\r\n\r\n\"That was all very well,\" said the physician, on describing the\r\noccurrence; \"but that 'pooh' took several guineas out of my pocket.\"\r\n\r\nFashionable as the Sympathetic Powder was for several years, it fell\r\ninto complete disrepute in this country before the death of Sir\r\nKenelm. Hartman, the Knight's attached servant, could, of his own\r\nexperience, say nothing more for it than, when dissolved in water, it\r\nwas a useful astringent lotion in cases of bleeding from the nose; but\r\nhe mentions a certain \"Mr. Smith, in the city of Augusta, in Germany,\r\nwho told me that he had a great respect for Sir D. K.'s books, and\r\nthat he made his sympatheticall powder every year, and did all his\r\nchiefest cures with it in green wounds, with much greater ease to the\r\npatient than if he had used ointments or plaisters.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1643 Sir Kenelm Digby was released from the confinement to which he\r\nhad been subjected by the Parliament. The condition of his liberty was\r\nthat he forthwith retired to the Continent--having previously pledged\r\nhis word as a Christian and a gentleman, in no way to act or plot\r\nagainst the Parliament. In France he became a celebrity of the highest\r\norder. Returning to England with the Restoration, he resided in \"the\r\nlast fair house westward in the north portico of Covent Garden,\" and\r\nbecame the centre of literary and scientific society. He was appointed\r\na member of the council of the Royal Society, on the incorporation of\r\nthat learned body in the year 1663. His death occurred in his\r\nsixty-second year, on the 11th of June, 1665; and his funeral took\r\nplace in Christ's Church, within Newgate, where, several years before,\r\nhe had raised a splendid tomb to the memory of the lovely and\r\nabandoned Venetia. His epitaph, by the pen of R. Ferrar, is concise,\r\nand not too eulogistic for a monumental inscription:--\r\n\r\n    \"Under this tomb the matchless Digby lies--\r\n    Digby the great, the valiant, and the wise;\r\n    This age's wonder for his noble parts,\r\n    Skill'd in six tongues, and learned in all the arts.\r\n    Born on the day he died--the Eleventh of June--\r\n    And that day bravely fought at Scanderoon.\r\n    It's rare that one and the same day should be\r\n    His day of birth, and death, and victory.\"\r\n\r\nAfter his death, with the approval of his son, was published (1669),\r\n\"The Closet of the Eminently Learned Sir Kenelme Digbie, Kt., Opened:\r\nWhereby is discovered Several ways for making of Metheglin, Sider,\r\nCherry-Wine, &c.; together with excellent Directions for Cookery: as\r\nalso for Preserving, Conserving, Candying, &c.\" The frontispiece of\r\nthis work is a portrait of Sir Kenelm, with a shelf over his head,\r\nadorned with his five principal works, entitled, \"Plants,\" \"Sym.\r\nPowder,\" \"His Cookery,\" \"Rects. in Physick, &c.,\" \"Sr. K. Digby of\r\nBodyes.\"\r\n\r\nIn Sir Kenelm's receipts for cookery the gastronome would find\r\nsomething to amuse him, and more to arouse his horror. Minced pies are\r\nmade (as they still are amongst the homely of some counties) of\r\n_meat_, raisins, and spices, mixed. Some of the sweet dishes very\r\nclosely resemble what are still served on English tables. The potages\r\nare well enough. But the barley-puddings, pear-puddings, and oat-meal\r\npuddings give ill promise to the ear. It is recommended to batter up a\r\ncouple of eggs and a lot of brown sugar in a cup of tea;--a not less\r\nimpious profanation of the sacred leaves than that committed by the\r\nHighlanders, mentioned by Sir Walter Scott, who, ignorant of the\r\nproper mode of treating a pound of fragrant Bohea, served it up\r\nin--melted butter!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nSIR HANS SLOANE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lives of three physicians--Sydenham, Sir Hans Sloane, and\r\nHeberden--completely bridge over the uncertain period between old\r\nempiricism and modern science. The son of a wealthy Dorsetshire\r\nsquire, Sydenham was born in 1624, and received the most important\r\npart of his education in the University of Oxford, where he was\r\ncreated Bachelor of Medicine 14th April, 1648. Settling in London\r\nabout 1661, he was admitted a Licentiate of the Royal College of\r\nPhysicians 25th June, 1665. Subsequently he acquired an M.D. degree at\r\nCambridge, but this step he did not take till 17th May, 1676. He also\r\nstudied physic at Montpellier; but it may be questioned if his\r\nprofessional success was a consequence of his labours in any seat of\r\nlearning, so much as a result of that knowledge of the world which he\r\ngained in the Civil war as a captain in the Parliamentary army. It was\r\nhe who replied to Sir Richard Blackmore's inquiry after the best\r\ncourse of study for a medical student to pursue--\"Read Don Quixote; it\r\nis a very good book--I read it still.\" Medical critics have felt it\r\nincumbent on themselves to explain away this memorable answer--attributing\r\nit to the doctor's cynical temper rather than his scepticism with\r\nregard to medicine. When, however, the state of medical science in the\r\nseventeenth century is considered, one has not much difficulty in\r\nbelieving that the shrewd physician meant exactly what he said. There\r\nis no question but that as a practitioner he was a man of many doubts.\r\nThe author of the capital sketch of Sydenham in the \"Lives of British\r\nPhysicians\" says--\"At the commencement of his professional life it is\r\nhanded down to us by tradition, that it was his ordinary custom, when\r\nconsulted by his patients for the first time, to hear attentively the\r\nstory of their complaints, and then say, 'Well, I will consider of\r\nyour case, and in a few days will order something for you.' But he\r\nsoon discovered that this deliberate method of proceeding was not\r\nsatisfactory, and that many of the persons so received forgot to come\r\nagain; and he was consequently obliged to adopt the usual practice of\r\nprescribing immediately for the diseases of those who sought his\r\nadvice.\" A doctor who feels the need for such deliberation must labour\r\nunder considerable perplexity as to the proper treatment of his\r\npatient. But the low opinion he expressed to Blackmore of books as\r\ninstructors in medicine, he gave publicly with greater decorum, but\r\nalmost as forcibly, in a dedication addressed to Dr. Mapletoft, where\r\nhe says, \"The medical art could not be learned so well and so surely\r\nas by use and experience; and that he who would pay the nicest and\r\nmost accurate attention to the symptoms of distempers would succeed\r\nbest in finding out the true means of cure.\"\r\n\r\nSydenham died in his house, in Pall Mall, on the 29th of December,\r\n1689. In his last years he was a martyr to gout, a malady fast\r\nbecoming one of the good things of the past. Dr. Forbes Winslow, in\r\nhis \"Physic and Physicians\"--gives a picture, at the same time painful\r\nand laughable, of the doctor's sufferings. \"Sydenham died of the gout;\r\nand in the latter part of his life is described as visited with that\r\ndreadful disorder, and sitting near an open window, on the ground\r\nfloor of his house, in St. James's Square, respiring the cool breeze\r\non a summer's evening, and reflecting, with a serene countenance and\r\ngreat complacency, on the alleviation to human misery that his skill\r\nin his art enabled him to give. Whilst this divine man was enjoying\r\none of these delicious reveries, a thief took away from the table,\r\nnear to which he was sitting, a silver tankard filled with his\r\nfavourite beverage, small beer, in which a sprig of rosemary had been\r\nimmersed, and ran off with it. Sydenham was too lame to ring his bell,\r\nand too feeble in his voice to give the alarm.\"\r\n\r\nHeberden, the medical friend of Samuel Johnson, was born in London in\r\n1710, and died on the 17th of May, 1801. Between Sydenham and Heberden\r\ncame Sir Hans Sloane, a man ever to be mentioned honourably amongst\r\nthose physicians who have contributed to the advancement of science,\r\nand the amelioration of society.\r\n\r\nPope says:--\r\n\r\n    \"'Tis strange the miser should his cares employ,\r\n    To gain those riches he can ne'er enjoy;\r\n    Is it less strange the prodigal should waste\r\n    His wealth to purchase what he ne'er can taste?\r\n    Not for himself he sees, or hears, or eats,\r\n    Artists must chuse his pictures, music, meats;\r\n    He buys for Topham drawings and designs,\r\n    For Pembroke statues, dirty gods, and coins;\r\n    Rare monkish manuscripts, for Hearne alone,\r\n    And books for Mead, and butterflies for Sloane.\"\r\n                       Pope's _Moral Essays_, Epistle IV.\r\n\r\nHans Sloane (the seventh and youngest child of Alexander Sloane,\r\nreceiver-general of taxes for the county of Down, before and after the\r\nCivil war, and a commissioner of array, after the restoration of\r\nCharles II.) was born at Killileagh in 1660. An Irishman by birth, and\r\na Scotchman by descent, he exhibited in no ordinary degree the energy\r\nand politeness of either of the sister countries. After a childhood of\r\nextreme delicacy he came to England, and devoted himself to medical\r\nstudy and scientific investigation. Having passed through a course of\r\ncareful labour in London, he visited Paris and Montpellier, and,\r\nreturning from the Continent, became the intimate friend of Sydenham.\r\nOn the 21st of January, 1685, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal\r\nSociety; and on the 12th of April, 1687, he became a Fellow of the\r\nCollege of Physicians. In the September of the latter year he sailed\r\nto the West Indies, in the character of physician to the Duke of\r\nAlbemarle, who had been appointed Governor of Jamaica. His residence\r\nin that quarter of the globe was not of long duration. On the death of\r\nhis Grace the doctor attended the Duchess back to England, arriving\r\nonce more in London in the July of 1689. From that time he remained in\r\nthe capital--his professional career, his social position, and his\r\nscientific reputation being alike brilliant. From 1694 to 1730, he was\r\na physician of Christ's Hospital. On the 30th of November, 1693, he\r\nwas elected Secretary of the Royal Society. In 1701 he was made an\r\nM.D. of Oxford; and in 1705 he was elected into the fellowship of the\r\nCollege of Physicians of Edinburgh. In 1708 he was chosen a Fellow of\r\nthe Royal Academy of Sciences of Paris. Four years later he was\r\nelected a member of the Royal Society of Berlin. In 1719 he became\r\npresident of the College of Physicians; and in 1727 he was created\r\nPresident of the Royal Society (on the death of Sir Isaac Newton), and\r\nwas appointed physician to King George II. In addition to these\r\nhonours, he won the distinction of being the first[6] medical\r\npractitioner advanced to the dignity of a baronetcy.\r\n\r\n  [6] The learned Librarian of the College of Physicians in a letter to\r\n  me, elicited by the first edition of \"The Book About Doctors,\"\r\n  observes on this point: \"Sir Hans Sloane is commonly stated to have\r\n  been the first medical baronet, but I think incorrectly. Sir Edmund\r\n  Greaves, M. D., a Fellow of the College, who died 11th Nov., 1680, is\r\n  said, and I am disposed to think with truth, to have been created a\r\n  Baronet at Oxford in 1645. Anthony A. Wood it is true calls him a\r\n  'pretended baronet,' but he was acknowledged to be a true and\r\n  veritable one by his colleagues of our college, and considering the\r\n  jealousy of physicians, which is not quite so great by the way as you\r\n  seem to think, this is no small testimony in favour of my belief. In\r\n  the 5th edition of Guillim's Heraldry he is made to be the 450th\r\n  baronet from the first institution of the order, and is placed between\r\n  William de Borcel of Amsterdam and George Carteret of Jersey. If you\r\n  think the matter worthy of investigation you may turn to Nash's\r\n  Worcestershire, vol. i., p. 198.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1742, Sir Hans Sloane quitted his professional residence at\r\nBloomsbury; and in the society of his library, museum, and a select\r\nnumber of scientific friends, spent the last years of his life at\r\nChelsea, the manor of which parish he had purchased in 1722.\r\n\r\nIn the _Gentleman's Magazine_ for 1748, there is a long but\r\ninteresting account of a visit paid by the Prince and Princess of\r\nWales to the Baronet's museum. Sir Hans received his royal guests and\r\nentertained them with a banquet of curiosities, the tables being\r\ncleverly shifted, so that a succession of \"courses,\" under glass\r\ncases, gave the charm of variety to the labours of observation.\r\n\r\nIn his old age Sir Hans became sadly penurious, grudging even the\r\nordinary expenses of hospitality. His intimate friend, George Edwards,\r\nF.R.S., gives, in his \"Gleanings of Natural History,\" some particulars\r\nof the old Baronet, which present a stronger picture of his parsimony\r\nthan can be found in the pages of his avowed detractors.\r\n\r\n\"Sir Hans, in the decline of his life, left London and retired to his\r\nmanor-house, at Chelsea, where he resided about fourteen years before\r\nhe died. After his retirement at Chelsea, he requested it as a favour\r\nto him (though I embraced it as an honour due to myself), that I would\r\nvisit him every week, in order to divert him for an hour or two with\r\nthe common news of the town, and with everything particular that\r\nshould happen amongst his acquaintance of the Royal Society, and other\r\ningenious gentlemen, many of whom I was weekly conversant with; and I\r\nseldom missed drinking coffee with him on a Saturday, during the whole\r\ntime of his retirement at Chelsea. He was so infirm as to be wholly\r\nconfined to his house, except sometimes, though rarely, taking a\r\nlittle air in his garden in a wheeled chair; and this confinement made\r\nhim very desirous to see any of his old acquaintance, to amuse him. He\r\nwas strictly careful that I should be at no expense in my journeys\r\nfrom London to Chelsea to wait on him, knowing that I did not\r\nsuperabound in the gifts of fortune. He would calculate what the\r\nexpense of coach-hire, waterage, or any other little charge that might\r\nattend on my journeys backward and forward would amount to, and would\r\noblige me annually to accept of it, though I would willingly have\r\ndeclined it.\"\r\n\r\nSuch generosity speaks of a parsimonious temper and habit more\r\nforcibly than positive acts of stinginess would.\r\n\r\nOn the death of Sir Hans Sloane, on the 11th of January, 1753, his\r\nmuseum and library passed into the hands of the nation for a\r\ncomparatively small sum of money, and became the nucleus of our\r\nBritish Museum.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Society of Sir Hans Sloane's time differed widely from the\r\nRoyal Society of the present day. The reader of Mr. Charles Weld's\r\nhistory of that distinguished fraternity smiles a painful smile at the\r\nfeeble steps of its first members in the direction of natural science.\r\nThe efficacy of the divining rod, and the merits of Sir Kenelm Digby's\r\nsympathetic powder, were the subjects that occupied the attention of\r\nthe philosophers of Charles II.'s reign. Entries such as the following\r\nare the records of their proceedings:--\r\n\r\n\"_June 5._--Col. Tuke related the manner of the rain like corn at\r\nNorwich, and Mr Boyle and Mr Evelyn were entreated to sow some of\r\nthose rained seeds to try their product.\r\n\r\n\"Magneticall cures were then discoursed of. Sir Gilbert Talbot\r\npromised to bring what he knew of sympathetical cures. Those that had\r\nany powder of sympathy were desired to bring some of it at the next\r\nmeeting.\r\n\r\n\"Mr Boyle related of a gentleman, who, having made some experiments of\r\nthe ayre, essayed the quicksilver experiment at the top and bottom of\r\na hill, when there was found three inches difference.\r\n\r\n\"Dr Charleton promised to bring in that white powder, which, put into\r\nwater, heates that.\r\n\r\n\"The Duke of Buckingham promised to cause charcoal to be distilled by\r\nhis chymist.\r\n\r\n\"His Grace promised to bring into the society a piece of a unicorne's\r\nhorn.\r\n\r\n\"Sir Kenelme Digby related that the calcined powder of toades\r\nreverberated, applyed in bagges upon the stomach of a pestiferate\r\nbody, cures it by several applications.\"\r\n\r\n\"_June 13._--Colonel Tuke brought in the history of rained seedes,\r\nwhich were reported to have fallen downe from heaven in Warwickshire\r\nand Shropshire, &c.\r\n\r\n\"That the dyving engine be going forward with all speed, and the\r\ntreasurer to procure the lead and moneys.\r\n\r\n\"Ordered, that Friday next the engine be tried at Deptford.\"\r\n\r\n\"_June 26._--Dr Ent, Dr Clarke, Dr Goddard, and Dr Whistler, were\r\nappointed curators of the proposition made by Sir G. Talbot, to\r\ntorment a man presently with the sympatheticall powder.\r\n\r\n\"Sir G. Talbot brought in his experiments of the sympathetick cures.\"\r\n\r\nIt is true that these passages relate to transactions of the Royal\r\nSociety that occurred long before Sir Hans was one of the body. But\r\neven in his time the advances made towards greater enlightenment were\r\nfew and feeble, when compared with the strides of science during the\r\nlast century. So simple and childish were the operations and\r\nspeculations of the Society in the first half of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, that even Sir John Hill was able to cover them with ridicule.\r\n\r\nSir Hans had two medical successors in the presidentship of the Royal\r\nSociety--Sir John Pringle, Bart., elected Nov. 30, 1772, and William\r\nHyde Wollaston, M.D., elected June 29, 1820. The last-mentioned\r\nphysician had but a brief tenure of the dignity, for he retired from\r\nthe exalted post on Nov. 30, 1820, in favor of Sir Humphrey Davy,\r\nBart.\r\n\r\nHumphrey Davy (the son of the Penzance woodcarver, who was known to\r\nhis acquaintances as \"Little Carver Davy\") was the most acute natural\r\nphilosopher of his generation, and at the same time about the vainest\r\nand most eccentric of his countrymen. With all his mental energy, he\r\nwas disfigured by a moral pettiness, which, to a certain extent,\r\njustified Wordsworth's unaccustomed bitterness in \"A Poet's\r\nEpitaph\":--\r\n\r\n    \"Physician art thou? one all eyes;\r\n      Philosopher? a fingering slave,\r\n    One that would peep and botanize\r\n      Upon his mother's grave!\r\n\r\n    \"Wrapt closely in thy sensual fleece,\r\n      O turn aside--and take, I pray,\r\n    That he below may rest in peace,\r\n      Thy ever-dwindling soul away!\"\r\n\r\nAt the summit of his success, Davy was morbidly sensitive of the\r\nhumility of his extraction. That his father had been a respectable\r\nmechanic--that his mother, on her husband's death, had established\r\nherself as milliner in Penzance, in order to apprentice her son to an\r\napothecary in that town--that by his own intellects, in the hard\r\nbattle of life, he had raised himself from obscure poverty to a\r\nbrilliant eminence--were to him facts of shame, instead of pride. In\r\ncontradiction to this moral cowardice, there was in him, on some\r\npoints, an extravagant eccentricity, which, in most men, would have\r\npointed to imperviousness to ridicule. The demands of society, and the\r\nlabours of his laboratory, of course left him with but little leisure.\r\nHe, however, affected not to have time enough for the ordinary\r\ndecencies of the toilet. Cold ablutions neither his constitution nor\r\nhis philosophic temperament required, so he rarely washed himself.\r\nAnd, on the plea of saving time, he used to put on his clean linen\r\nover his dirty--so that he has been known to wear at the same time\r\nfive shirts and five pairs of stockings. On the rare occasions when he\r\ndivested himself of his superfluous integuments, he caused infinite\r\nperplexity to his less intimate friends, who could not account for his\r\nrapid transition from corpulence to tenuity.\r\n\r\nThe ludicrousness of his costume did not end there. Like many other\r\nmen of powerful and excitable minds, he was very fond of angling; and\r\non the banks of the Thames he might be found, at all unsuitable\r\nseasons, in a costume that must have been a source of no common\r\nmerriment to the river nymphs. His coat and breeches were of green\r\ncloth. On his head he wore a hat that Dr. Paris describes as \"having\r\nbeen originally intended for a coal-heaver, but as having, when in its\r\nraw state, been dyed green by some sort of pigment.\" In this attire\r\nDavy flattered himself that he resembled vegetable life as closely as\r\nit was possible for mortal to do.\r\n\r\nBut if his angling dress was droll, his shooting costume was more so.\r\nHis great fear as an angler was that the fish should escape him; his\r\ngreatest anxiety as a bearer of a gun was to escape being shot. In the\r\none character, concealment was his chief object--in the other,\r\nrevelation. So that he might be seen from a distance, and run fewer\r\nchances of being fired into by accident, he was accustomed on shooting\r\nexcursions, to crown himself with a broad-brimmed hat, covered with\r\nscarlet. It never struck him that, in our Protestant England, he\r\nincurred imminent peril of being mistaken for a cardinal, and knocked\r\nover accordingly.\r\n\r\nNaturally, Davy was of a poetical temperament; and some of his boyish\r\npoetry possesses merit that unquestionably justifies the anticipation\r\nformed by his poet-friends of the flights his more mature muse would\r\ntake. But when his intellect became absorbed in the pursuits by which\r\nhe rendered inestimable service to his species, he never renewed the\r\nbright imaginings of his day-spring.\r\n\r\nOn passing (in 1809) through the galleries of the Louvre, he could\r\nfind nothing more worthy of admiration than the fine frames of the\r\npictures. \"What an extraordinary collection of fine frames!\" he\r\nobserved to the gentleman who acted as his guide, amidst the treasures\r\nof art gathered from every part of the Continent. His attention was\r\ndirected to the \"Transfiguration\"; when, on its being suggested to him\r\nthat he was looking at a rather well-executed picture, he said,\r\ncoldly, \"Indeed! I am glad I have seen it.\" In the same way, the\r\nstatues were to him simply blocks of material. In the Apollo\r\nBelvidere, the Laocoon, and the Venus dei Medici, he saw no beauty;\r\nbut when his eyes rested on the Antinous, treated in the Egyptian\r\nstyle, and sculptured in alabaster, he made an exclamation of delight,\r\nand cried, \"Gracious powers, what a beautiful stalactite!\"\r\n\r\nMore amusing than even these criticisms, is a story told of Lady Davy,\r\nwho accompanied her husband to Paris. She was walking in the Tuileries\r\ngarden, wearing the fashionable London bonnet of the day--shaped like\r\na cockle-shell. The Parisians, who just then were patronizing bonnets\r\nof enormous dimensions, were astounded at the apparition of a\r\nhead-dress so opposed to their notions of the everlasting fitness of\r\nthings; and with the good breeding for which they are and have long\r\nbeen proverbial, they surrounded the daring stranger, and stared at\r\nher. This was sufficiently unpleasant to a timid English lady. But her\r\ndiscomfort had only commenced. Ere another minute or two had elapsed,\r\none of the inspectors of the garden approached, and telling her\r\nLadyship that no cause of _rassemblement_ could be permitted in that\r\nlocality, requested her to retire. Alarmed and indignant, she appealed\r\nto some officers of the Imperial Guard, but they could afford her no\r\nassistance. One of them politely offered her his arm, and proposed to\r\nconduct her to a carriage. But by the time she had decided to profit\r\nby the courtesy, such a crowd had gathered together, that it was found\r\nnecessary to send for a guard of infantry, and remove _la belle\r\nAnglaise_, surrounded with bayonets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE APOTHECARIES AND SIR SAMUEL GARTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nBaldwin Hamey, whose manuscript memoirs of eminent physicians are\r\namong the treasures of the College, praises Winston because he treated\r\nhis apothecary as a master might a slave. \"Heriliter imperavit,\" says\r\nthe Doctor. The learned Thomas Winston, anatomy lecturer at Gresham\r\nCollege, lived to the age of eighty years, and died on the 24th of\r\nOctober, 1655. He knew, therefore, apothecaries in the day of their\r\nhumility--before prosperity had encouraged them to compete with their\r\nprofessional superiors.\r\n\r\nThe apothecaries of the Elizabethan era compounded their medicines\r\nmuch as medicines are compounded at the present--as far as\r\nmanipulation and measuring are concerned. Prescriptions have altered,\r\nbut shop-customs have undergone only a very slight change. The\r\napothecaries' table of weights and measures, still in use, was the\r\nrule in the sixteenth century, and the symbols (for a pound, an ounce,\r\na drachm, a scruple, a grain, &c.) remain at this day just what they\r\nwere three hundred years ago.\r\n\r\nOur good friend, William Bulleyn, gave the following excellent rules\r\nfor an apothecary's life and conduct:--\r\n\r\n\"THE APOTICARYE.\r\n\r\n\"1.--Must fyrst serve God, forsee the end, be clenly, pity the poore.\r\n\r\n\"2.--Must not be suborned for money to hurt mankynde.\r\n\r\n\"3.--His place of dwelling and shop to be clenly to please the sences\r\nwithal.\r\n\r\n\"4.--His garden must be at hand with plenty of herbes, seedes, and\r\nrootes.\r\n\r\n\"5.--To sow, set, plant, gather, preserve and kepe them in due tyme.\r\n\r\n\"6.--To read Dioscorides, to know ye natures of plants and herbes.\r\n\r\n\"7.--To invent medicines to chose by coloure, tast, odour, figure, &c.\r\n\r\n\"8.--To have his morters, stilles, pottes, filters, glasses, boxes,\r\ncleane and sweete.\r\n\r\n\"9.--To have charcoals at hand, to make decoctions, syrupes, &c.\r\n\r\n\"10.--To kepe his cleane ware closse, and cast away the baggage.\r\n\r\n\"11.--To have two places in his shop--one most cleane for the phisik,\r\nand a baser place for the chirurgie stuff.\r\n\r\n\"12.--That he neither increase nor diminish the physician's bill (_i.\r\ne._ prescription), and kepe it for his own discharge.\r\n\r\n\"13.--That he neither buy nor sel rotten drugges.\r\n\r\n\"14.--That he peruse often his wares, that they corrupt not.\r\n\r\n\"15.--That he put not in _quid pro quo_ (_i. e._, use one ingredient\r\nin the place of another, when dispensing a physician's prescription)\r\nwithout advysement.\r\n\r\n\"16.--That he may open wel a vein for to helpe pleuresy.\r\n\r\n\"17.--That he meddle only in his vocation.\r\n\r\n\"18.--That he delyte to reede Nicolaus Myrepsus, Valerius Cordus,\r\nJohannes Placaton, the Lubik, &c.\r\n\r\n\"19.--That he do remember his office is only to be ye physician's\r\ncooke.\r\n\r\n\"20.--That he use true measure and waight.\r\n\r\n\"21.--To remember his end, and the judgment of God: and thus I do\r\ncommend him to God, if he be not covetous, or crafty, seeking his own\r\nlucre before other men's help, succour, and comfort.\"\r\n\r\nThe apothecaries to whom these excellent directions were given were\r\nonly tradesmen--grocers who paid attention to the commands of\r\nphysicians. They were not required to have any knowledge of the\r\nmedical science, beyond what might be obtained by the perusal of two\r\nor three writers; they were not to presume to administer drugs on\r\ntheir own judgment and responsibility--or to perform any surgical\r\noperation, except phlebotomy, and that only for one malady. The custom\r\nwas for the doctors to sell their most valuable remedies as nostrums,\r\nkeeping their composition a secret to themselves, and themselves\r\ntaking the price paid for them by the sick. The commoner drugs were\r\nvended to patients by the drug-merchants (who invariably dealt in\r\ngroceries for culinary use, as well as in medicinal simples), acting\r\nunder the directions of the learned graduates of the Faculty.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth year of James I., a charter was obtained, that \"Willed,\r\nordained, and granted, that all and singular the Freemen of the\r\nMystery of Grocers and Apothecaries of the City of London ... should\r\nand might be ... one body corporate and politique, in deed, fact, and\r\nname, by the name of Warden and Commonalty of the Mystery of Grocers\r\nof the City of London.\" But in the thirteenth year of the same king,\r\nthe apothecaries and grocers were disunited. At the advice of Theodore\r\nde Mayerne and Henry Atkins, doctors in physick, another charter was\r\ngranted, constituting drug-venders a distinct company. Amongst the\r\napothecaries mentioned in this charter are the names of the most\r\nrespectable families of the country. Gideon de Laune, one of this\r\nfirst batch of apothecaries, amassed a very large fortune in his\r\nvocation, and founded a family at Sharsted, in Kent, from which\r\nseveral persons of distinction draw part of their origin; and not a\r\nfew of De Laune's brethren were equally lucky.\r\n\r\nAt their first foundation as a company the apothecaries were put\r\ncompletely under control of the College of Physicians, who were\r\nendowed with dangerous powers of inspecting their wares and punishing\r\ntheir malpractices. But before a generation had passed away, the\r\napothecaries had gained such a firm footing in society that the more\r\nprosperous of them could afford to laugh at the censures of the\r\nCollege; and before the close of a century they were fawned upon by\r\nyoung physicians, and were in a position to quarrel with the old.\r\n\r\nThe doctors of that day knew so little that the apothecaries found it\r\neasy to know as much. A knowledge of the herbals, an acquaintance with\r\nthe ingredients and doses of a hundred empirical compounds and\r\nsystems of maltreating eruptive fevers, gout, and consumption,\r\nconstituted all the medical learning of such men as Mayerne or\r\nGibbons. To pick up that amount of information was no hard task for an\r\nambitious apothecary.\r\n\r\nSoon the leading apothecaries began to prescribe on their own\r\nresponsibility, without the countenance of a member of the College. If\r\nthey were threatened with censure or other punishment by a regular\r\nphysician, they retorted by discontinuing to call him in to\r\nconsultations. Jealousies soon sprang up. Starving graduates, with the\r\ndiplomas of Oxford and Cambridge and the certificates of the College\r\nin their pockets, were embittered by having to trudge the pavements of\r\nLondon, and see the mean medicine-mixers (who had scarce scholarship\r\nenough to construe a Latin bill) dashing by in their carriages. Ere\r\nlong the heartburnings broke out in a paper warfare, as rancorous and\r\ndisreputable as any squabble embalmed in literature. The scholars\r\ncalled the rich tradesmen thieves, swindlers, and unlettered\r\nblockheads. The rich tradesmen taunted the scholars with discontent,\r\nfalsehood, and ignorance of everything except Latin and Greek.\r\n\r\nPope took the side of the physicians. Like Johnson, Parr, and all men\r\nof enlightenment and sound scholarship, he had a high opinion of the\r\nFaculty. It is indeed told of him, on questionable authority, that on\r\nhis death-bed, when he heard the bickerings of Dr. Burton and Dr.\r\nThompson, each accusing the other of maltreating his patient, he\r\nlevelled with his last breath an epigram at the two rivals--\r\n\r\n    \"Dunces, rejoice, forgive all censures past--\r\n    The greatest dunce has killed your foe at last.\"\r\n\r\nTo Dr. Arbuthnot he wrote--\r\n\r\n    \"Friend to my life, which did not you prolong,\r\n    The world had wanted many an idle song.\"\r\n\r\nHis feeble health, making his life a long disease, never allowed him\r\nvigour and confidence enough to display ingratitude to the Faculty,\r\nand illustrate the truth of the lines--\r\n\r\n    \"God and the doctor we alike adore,\r\n    But only when in danger, not before;\r\n    The danger o'er, both are alike requited,\r\n    God is forgotten, and the doctor slighted.\"\r\n\r\nHis habitual tone, when speaking of the medical profession, was that\r\nof warm admiration and affection. In the \"Imitations of Horace\" he\r\nsays--\r\n\r\n    \"Weak though I am of limb, and short of sight,\r\n    Far from a lynx, and not a giant quite,\r\n    I'll do what Mead and Cheselden advise,\r\n    To keep these limbs, and to preserve these eyes.\"\r\n\r\nIt is true that he elsewhere ridicules Mead's fondness for rare books\r\nand Sloane's passion for butterflies; but at the close of his days he\r\nwrote in a confidential letter to a friend of the Faculty, \"They are\r\nin general the most amiable companions and the best friends, as well\r\nas the most learned men I know.\"\r\n\r\nIn the protracted dissensions between the physicians and the\r\napothecaries Pope was a cordial supporter of the former. When he\r\naccused, in the \"Essay on Criticism,\" the penny-a-lining critics of\r\nacquiring their slender knowledge of the poetic art from the poets\r\nthey assailed, he compared them to apothecaries whose scientific\r\ninformation was pilfered from the prescriptions they were required to\r\ndispense.\r\n\r\n    \"Then Criticism the Muse's handmaid proved,\r\n    To dress her charms and make her more beloved:\r\n    But following wits from that intention stray'd.\r\n    Who could not win the mistress, woo'd the maid;\r\n    Against the poets their own arms they turn'd,\r\n    Sure to hate most the men from whom they learn'd.\r\n    So modern 'Pothecaries, taught the art\r\n    By Doctors' bills to play the Doctor's part,\r\n    Bold in the practice of mistaken rules,\r\n    Prescribe, apply, and call their masters fools.\"\r\n\r\nThe origin of the memorable Dispensarian Campaign between the College\r\nof Physicians and the Company of Apothecaries is a story that can be\r\nbriefly told. The younger physicians, impatient at beholding the\r\nprosperity and influence of the apothecaries, and the older ones\r\nindignant at seeing a class of men they despised creeping into their\r\nquarters and craftily laying hold of a portion of their monopoly,\r\nconcocted a scheme to reinstate themselves in public favour. Without a\r\ndoubt many of the physicians who countenanced this scheme gave it\r\ntheir support from purely charitable motives; but it cannot be\r\nquestioned that as a body the dispensarians were actuated in their\r\nhumanitarian exertions by a desire to lower the apothecaries, and\r\nraise themselves in the eyes of the world. With all its genuine and\r\nsterling benevolence, the medical profession, by the unworthy and\r\nsilly conduct of its obscure members, has repeatedly laid itself open\r\nto the charge of trading on its reputation for humanity. In Smollett's\r\ntime, as his novels show, the recognized mode employed by unknown\r\ndoctors to puff themselves into notoriety and practice, was to get up\r\nlittle hospitals and infirmaries, and advertise to the charitable for\r\naid in the good task of ameliorating the condition of the poor. And\r\nhalf the peddling little charitable institutions, infirmaries,\r\ndispensaries, or hospitals, that at the present time rob the rich and\r\ndo harm to the poor in every quarter of London, originated in \"the\r\nfriends\" of young physicians and surgeons conspiring together to get\r\nthem \"the position of being attached to an hospital staff.\" In 1687,\r\nthe physicians at a college-meeting, voted \"that all members of the\r\nCollege, whether Fellows, Candidates, or Licentiates, should give\r\ntheir advice gratis to all their sick neighbouring poor, when desired,\r\nwithin the city of London, or seven miles round.\"\r\n\r\nTo give prescriptions to the very poor, unaccompanied with the means\r\nof getting them dispensed, is of little use. Sir Astley Cooper used to\r\nsee in the vicinity of his residence the slips of paper, marked with\r\nhis pen, which it was his wont to distribute gratuitously to indigent\r\napplicants. The fact was, the poor people, finding it beyond their\r\nmeans to pay the druggist for dispensing them, threw them away in\r\ndisgust. It was just the same in 1687. The poor folk carried their\r\nprescriptions to the apothecaries, to learn that the trade charge for\r\ndispensing them was beyond their means. The physicians asserted that\r\nthe demands of the drug-venders were extortionate, and were not\r\nreduced to meet the finances of the applicants, to the end that the\r\nundertakings of benevolence might prove abortive. This was of course\r\nabsurd. The apothecaries knew their own interests better than so to\r\noppose a system which at least rendered drug-consuming fashionable\r\nwith the lower orders. Perhaps they regarded the poor as their\r\npeculiar field of practice, and felt insulted at having the same\r\nhumble people--for whom they had pompously prescribed and put up\r\nboluses at two-pence apiece--now entering their shops with papers\r\ndictating what the two-penny bolus was to be composed of. But the\r\ncharge preferred against them was groundless. Indeed, a numerous body\r\nof the apothecaries expressly offered to sell medicines \"to the poor\r\nwithin their respective parishes, at such rates as the committee of\r\nphysicians should think reasonable.\"\r\n\r\nBut this would not suit the game of the physicians. \"A proposal was\r\nstarted by a committee of the College, that the College should furnish\r\nthe medicines of the poor, and perfect alone that charity which the\r\napothecaries refused to concur in; and after divers methods\r\nineffectually tried, and much time wasted in endeavouring to bring the\r\nApothecaries to terms of reason in relation to the poor, an instrument\r\nwas subscribed by divers charitably disposed members of the College,\r\nnow in number about fifty, wherein they obliged themselves to pay ten\r\npounds apiece towards the preparing and delivering medicines at their\r\nintrinsic value.\" Such was the version of the affair given by the\r\nCollege apologists. The plan was acted upon; and a dispensary was\r\neventually established (some nine years after the vote of 1687) in the\r\nCollege of Physicians, Warwick Lane, where medicines were vended to\r\nthe poor at cost price.\r\n\r\nThis measure of the College was impolitic and unjustifiable. It was\r\nunjust to that important division of the trade who were ready to vend\r\nthe medicines at rates to be fixed by the College authorities--for it\r\ntook altogether out of their hands the small amount of profit which\r\nthey, as _dealers_, could have realized on those terms. It was also an\r\neminently unwise course. The College sank to the level of the\r\nApothecaries' Hall, becoming an emporium for the sale of medicines.\r\nIt was all very well to say that no profit was made on such sale--the\r\ncensorious world would not believe it. The apothecaries and their\r\nfriends denied that such was the fact, and avowed that the benevolent\r\ndispensarians were bent only on underselling and ruining them.\r\n\r\nAgain, the movement introduced dissension within the walls of the\r\nCollege. Many of the first physicians, with the conservatism of\r\nsuccess, did not care to offend the apothecaries, who were continually\r\ncalling them in, and paying them fees. They therefore joined in the\r\ncry against the dispensary. The profession was split up into\r\ndispensarians and anti-dispensarians. The apothecaries combined and\r\nagreed not to recommend the dispensarians. The anti-dispensarians\r\nrepaid this ill service by refusing to meet dispensarians in\r\nconsultation. Sir Thomas Millington, the president of the College,\r\nEdward Hulse, Hans Sloane, John Woodward, Sir Edmund King, and Samuel\r\nGarth were amongst the latter. Of them the last-named was the man who\r\nrendered the most efficient service to his party.\r\n\r\nGarth is perhaps the most cherished by the present generation of all\r\nthe physicians of Pope's time. He was a Whig without rancour, and a\r\nbon-vivant without selfishness. Full of jest and amiability, he did\r\nmore to create merriment at the Kit-Kat club than either Swift or\r\nArbuthnot. He loved wine to excess; but then wine loved him too,\r\nripening and warming his wit, and leaving no sluggish humour behind.\r\nHis practice was a good one, but his numerous patients prized his\r\n_bon-mots_ more than his prescriptions. His enemies averred that he\r\nwas not only an epicure, but a profligate voluptuary and an infidel.\r\nPope, however, wrote of him after his death, \"If ever there was a good\r\nChristian, without knowing himself to be so, it was Dr. Garth.\" Pope\r\nhad honoured him when alive by dedicating his second pastoral to him.\r\n\r\n    \"Accept, O Garth, the muse's early lays,\r\n    That adds this wreath of ivy to thy bays;\r\n    Hear what from love unpractised hearts endure,\r\n    From love, the sole disease thou canst not cure.\"\r\n\r\nA good picture of Garth the politician is found in the \"Journal to\r\nStella.\" \"London, Nov. 17, 1711,\" writes Swift--\"This is Queen\r\nElizabeth's birthday, usually kept in this town by apprentices, &c.;\r\nbut the Whigs designed a mighty procession by midnight, and had laid\r\nout a thousand pounds to dress up the pope, devil, cardinals,\r\nSacheverel, &c., and carry them with torches about and burn them. They\r\ndid it by contribution. Garth gave five guineas; Dr. Garth I mean, if\r\never you heard of him. But they were seized last night by order from\r\nthe Secretary.... The figures are now at the Secretary's Office at\r\nWhitehall. I design to see them if I can.\"\r\n\r\nA Whig, but the friend of Tories, Garth cordially disliked Sir Richard\r\nBlackmore, a member of his own profession and political party.\r\nBlackmore was an anti-dispensarian, a bad poet, and a pure and rigid\r\nmoralist. Naturally Garth abominated him, and sneered at him for his\r\npomposity and bad scholarship. It is to be regretted that Garth, with\r\nthe vulgarity of the age, twitted him with his early poverty, and with\r\nhaving been--a schoolmaster. To ridicule his enemy Garth composed the\r\nfollowing verses:--\r\n\r\n        \"TO THE MERRY POETASTER, AT SADLER'S\r\n               HALL, IN CHEAPSIDE.\r\n\r\n    \"Unwieldy pedant, let thy awkward muse\r\n    With censures praise, with flatteries abuse;\r\n    To lash, and not be felt, in thee's an art,\r\n    That ne'er mad'st any but thy school-boys smart.\r\n    Then be advised and scribble not again--\r\n    Thou'rt fashion'd for a flail and not a pen.\r\n    If B----l's immortal wit thou would'st decry,\r\n    Pretend 'tis he that wrote thy poetry.\r\n    Thy feeble satire ne'er can do him wrong--\r\n    Thy poems and thy patients live not long.\"\r\n\r\nGarth's death, as described by William Ayre, was characteristic. He\r\nwas soon tired of an invalid's suffering and helplessness, the _ennui_\r\nand boredom of the sick-room afflicting him more than the bodily pain.\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" said he to the crowd of weeping friends who stood round\r\nhis bed, \"I wish the ceremony of death was over.\" And so, sinking\r\nlower in the bed, he died without a struggle. He had previously, on\r\nbeing informed that his end was approaching, expressed pleasure at the\r\nintelligence, because he was tired of having his shoes pulled off and\r\non. The manner of Garth's exit reminds one of the death of Rabelais,\r\nalso a physician. The presence of officious friends troubled him; and\r\nwhen he saw his doctors consulting together, he raised his head from\r\nhis pillow and said with a smile, \"Dear gentlemen, let me die a\r\nnatural death.\" After he had received extreme unction, a friend\r\napproached him, and asked him how he did. \"I am going on my journey,\"\r\nwas the answer--\"they have greased my boots already.\"\r\n\r\nGarth has, apart from his literary productions, one great claim on\r\nposterity. To him Dryden owed honourable interment. When the great\r\npoet died, Garth caused his body to be conveyed to the College of\r\nPhysicians, and started a public subscription to defray the expenses\r\nof the funeral. He pronounced an oration over the deceased at the\r\nCollege in Warwick Lane, and then accompanied it to Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\nOf the stories preserved of Garth's social humour some are exquisitely\r\ndroll. Writing a letter at a coffee-house, he found himself overlooked\r\nby a curious Irishman, who was impudently reading every word of the\r\nepistle. Garth took no notice of the impertinence, until he had\r\nfinished and signed the body of the letter, when he added a\r\npostscript, of unquestionable legibility: \"I would write you more by\r\nthis post, but there's a d---- tall impudent Irishman looking over my\r\nshoulder all the time.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean, sir?\" roared the Irishman in a fury. \"Do you think\r\nI looked over your letter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" replied the physician, \"I never once opened my lips to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, but you have put it down, for all that.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Tis impossible, sir, that you should know that, for you have never\r\nonce looked over my letter.\"\r\n\r\nStumbling into a Presbyterian church one Sunday, for pastime, he found\r\na pathetic preacher shedding tears over the iniquity of the earth.\r\n\r\n\"What makes the man greet?\" asked Garth of a bystander.\r\n\r\n\"By my faith,\" was the answer, \"and you too would greet if you were in\r\nhis place and had as little to say.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come along, my dear fellow,\" responded Garth to his new acquaintance,\r\n\"and dine with me. You are too good a fellow to be here.\"\r\n\r\nAt the Kit-Kat he once stayed to drink long after he had said that he\r\nmust be off to see his patients. Sir Richard, more humane than the\r\nphysician, or possibly, like the rest of the world, not disinclined to\r\nbe virtuous at another's expense, observed, \"Really, Garth, you ought\r\nto have no more wine, but be off to see those poor devils.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's no great matter,\" Garth replied, \"whether I see them to-night or\r\nnot, for nine of them have such bad constitutions, that all the\r\nphysicians in the world can't save them; and the other six have such\r\ngood constitutions, that all the physicians in the world can't kill\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nBorn of a respectable north-country family, Garth was educated first\r\nat a provincial school, and then at Cambridge. He was admitted a\r\nFellow of the College of Physicians on June 26, 1692, just when the\r\nquarrel of the Physicians and Apothecaries was waxing to its hottest,\r\n_i. e._ between the College edict of 1687, ordaining gratuitous\r\nadvice, and the creation of the dispensary in 1696. As a young man he\r\nsaw that his right place was with the dispensarians--and he took it.\r\nFor a time his great poem, \"The Dispensary,\" covered the apothecaries\r\nand anti-dispensarians with ridicule. It rapidly passed through\r\nnumerous editions--in each of which, as was elegantly observed, the\r\nworld lost and gained much. To say that of all the books, pamphlets,\r\nand broad-sheets thrown out by the combatants on both sides, it is by\r\nfar the one of the greatest merit, would be scant justice, when it\r\nmight almost be said that it is the only one of them that can now be\r\nread by a gentleman without a sense of annoyance and disgust. There is\r\nno point of view from which the medical profession appears in a more\r\nhumiliating and contemptible light than that which the literature of\r\nthis memorable squabble presents to the student. Charges of ignorance,\r\ndishonesty, and extortion were preferred on both sides; and the\r\ndispensarian physicians did not hesitate to taunt their brethren of\r\nthe opposite camp with playing corruptly into the hands of the\r\napothecaries--prescribing enormous and unnecessary quantities of\r\nmedicine, so that the drug-venders might make heavy bills, and, as a\r\nconsequence, recommend in all directions such complacent _superiors_\r\nto be called in. Garth's poem, unfair and violent though it is, seldom\r\noffends against decency. As a work of art it cannot be ranked high,\r\nand is now deservedly forgotten, although it has many good lines, and\r\nsome felicitous satire. Johnson rightly pointed to the secret of its\r\nsuccess, though he took a one-sided and unjust view of the dissensions\r\nwhich called it forth. \"The poem,\" observes the biographer, \"as its\r\nsubject was present and popular, co-operated with passions and\r\nprejudices then prevalent; and, with such auxiliaries to its intrinsic\r\nmerit, was universally and liberally applauded. It was on the side of\r\ncharity against the intrigues of interest, and of regular learning\r\nagainst licentious usurpation of medical authority.\"\r\n\r\nSir Samuel Garth (knighted by the sword of Marlborough) died January\r\n18, 1718-19, and was buried at Harrow-on-the-Hill.\r\n\r\nBut he lived to see the apothecaries gradually emancipate themselves\r\nfrom the ignominious regulations to which they consented, when their\r\nvocation was first separated from the grocery trade. Four years after\r\nhis death they obtained legal acknowledgment of their right to\r\ndispense and sell medicines without the prescription of a physician;\r\nand six years later the law again decided in their favour, with regard\r\nto the physicians' right of examining and condemning their drugs. In\r\n1721, Mr. Rose, an apothecary, on being prosecuted by the College for\r\nprescribing as well as compounding medicines, carried the matter into\r\nthe House of Lords, and obtained a favourable decision. And from 1727,\r\nin which year Mr. Goodwin, an apothecary, obtained in a court of law a\r\nconsiderable sum for an illegal seizure of his wares (by Drs.\r\nArbuthnot, Bale, and Levit), the physicians may be said to have\r\ndiscontinued to exercise their privileges of inspection.\r\n\r\nArbuthnot did not exceed Garth in love to the apothecaries. His\r\ncontempt for, and dislike of, the fraternity, inspired him to write\r\nhis \"Essay on an Apothecary.\" He thinks it a pity that, to prevent the\r\ncountry from being overrun with apothecaries, it should not be allowed\r\nto anatomize them, for the improvement of natural knowledge. He\r\nridicules them for pedantically \"dressing all their discourse in the\r\nlanguage of the Faculty.\"\r\n\r\n\"At meals,\" he says, \"they distributed their wine with a little lymph,\r\ndissected a widgeon, cohobated their pease-porridge, and amalgamated a\r\ncustard. A morsel of beef was a bolus; a grillard was sacrificed;\r\neating was mastication and deglutition; a dish of steaks was a\r\ncompound of many powerful ingredients; and a plate of soup was a very\r\nexalted preparation. In dress, a suit of cloaths was a system, a\r\nloophole a valve, and a surtout an integument. Cloth was a texture of\r\nfibres spread into a drab or kersey; a small rent in it was cutaneous;\r\na thread was a filament; and the waistband of the breeches the\r\nperitoneum.\"\r\n\r\nThe superior branch of the Faculty invited in many ways the same\r\nsatire. Indeed, pedantry was the prevalent fault of the manners of the\r\neighteenth century. The physician, the divine, the lawyer, the\r\nparliament-man, the country gentleman, the author by profession--all\r\nhad peculiarities of style, costume, speech, or intonation, by which\r\nthey were well pleased they should be recognised. In one respect, this\r\nwas well; men were proud of being what they were, and desired to be\r\nknown as belonging to their respective vocations. They had no anxiety\r\nto be free from trade-marks. The barrister's smirk, the physician's\r\nunctuous smiles, the pedagogue's frown, did not originate in a mean\r\ndesire to be taken for something of higher mark and esteem than they\r\nreally were.\r\n\r\nFrom the time when Bulleyn called him the physician's cook, down to\r\nthe present, generation, the pure apothecary is found holding a very\r\nsubordinate position. His business is to do unpleasant drudgery that a\r\ngentleman finds it unpleasant to perform, but which cannot be left to\r\nthe hands of a nurse. The questions to be considered previous to\r\nbecoming an apprentice to an apothecary, put in Chemberlaine's\r\n\"Tyrocinium Medicum,\" well describe the state of the apothecary's\r\npupil. \"Can you bear the thoughts of being obliged to get up out of\r\nyour warm bed, on a cold winter's night, or rather morning, to make up\r\nmedicines which your employer, just arrived through frost and snow,\r\nprescribes for a patient taken suddenly or dangerously ill?--or,\r\nsupposing that your master is not in sufficient business to keep a\r\nboy to take out medicines, can you make up your mind to think it no\r\nhardship to take them to the patient after you have made them up?\"\r\n&c., &c. When such services were expected from pupils studying for\r\nadmittance to the craft, of course boys with ample means, or prospects\r\nelsewhere, did not as a rule desire to become apothecaries.\r\n\r\nWithin the last fifty years changes have been affected in various\r\ndepartments of the medical profession, that have rendered the\r\napothecary a feature of the past, and transferred his old functions to\r\na new labourer. Prior to 1788, it is stated on authority there were\r\nnot in all London more than half-a-dozen druggists who dispensed\r\nmedicines from physicians' prescriptions. Before that time, the\r\napothecaries--the members of the Apothecaries' Company--were almost\r\nthe sole compounders and preparers of drugs. At the present time it is\r\nexceptional for an apothecary to put up prescriptions, unless he is\r\nacting as the family or ordinary medical attendant to the patient\r\nprescribed for. As a young man, indeed, he sometimes condescends to\r\nkeep an open shop; but as soon as he can get on without \"counter\"\r\nbusiness, he leaves the commercial part of his occupation to the\r\ndruggist, as beneath his dignity. The dispensing chemists and\r\ndruggists, whose shops, flashing with blue bottles (last remnant of\r\nempiric charlatanry), brighten our street corners and scare our horses\r\nat night, are the apothecaries of the last century. The apothecary\r\nhimself--that is, the member of the Company--is hardly ever found as\r\nan apothecary _pur et simple_. He enrolls himself at \"the hall\" for\r\nthe sake of being able to sue ungrateful patients for money due to\r\nhim. But in the great majority of cases he is also a Fellow or Member\r\nof the College of Surgeons, and acts as a general practitioner; that\r\nis, he does anything and everything--prescribes and dispenses his\r\nprescriptions; is at the same time physician, surgeon, accoucheur, and\r\ndentist. Physic and surgery were divided at a very early date in\r\ntheory, but in practice they were combined by eminent physicians till\r\na comparatively recent period. And yet later the physician performed\r\nthe functions of the apothecary, just as the apothecary presumed to\r\ndischarge the offices of physician. It was not derogatory to the\r\ndignity of a leading physician, in the reign of Charles the Second, to\r\nkeep a shop, and advertise the wares vended in it, announcing in the\r\nsame manner their prices. Dr. Mead realized large sums by the sale of\r\nworthless nostrums. And only a few years since, a distinguished\r\nCambridge physician, retaining as an octogenarian the popularity he\r\nhad achieved as a young man, in one of our eastern counties, used to\r\nsell his \"gout tincture\"--a secret specific against gout--at so many\r\nshillings per bottle. In many respects the general practitioner of\r\nthis century would consider his professional character compromised if\r\nhe adopted the customs generally in vogue amongst the physicians of\r\nthe last.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nQUACKS.\r\n\r\n     \"So then the subject being so variable, hath made the art by\r\n     consequence more conjectural; an art being conjectural hath\r\n     made so much the more place to be left for imposture. For\r\n     almost all other arts and sciences are judged by acts or\r\n     masterpieces, as I may term them, and not by the successes\r\n     and events. The lawyer is judged by the virtue of his\r\n     pleading, and not by the issue of the cause. The master of\r\n     the ship is judged by the directing his course aright, and\r\n     not by the fortune of the voyage. But the physician, and\r\n     perhaps the politician, hath no particular acts\r\n     demonstrative of his ability, but is judged most by the\r\n     event; which is ever but as it is taken: for who can tell,\r\n     if a patient die or recover, or if a state be preserved or\r\n     ruined, whether it be art or accident? and therefore many\r\n     times the impostor is prized, and the man of virtue taxed.\r\n     _Nay, we see the weakness and credulity of men is such, as\r\n     they will often prefer a mountebank or witch before a\r\n     learned physician._\"--Lord Bacon's \"_Advancement of\r\n     Learning_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of quackery, if it were written on a scale that should\r\ninclude the entire number of those frauds which may be generally\r\nclassed under the head of humbug, would be the history of the human\r\nrace in all ages and climes. Neither the benefactors nor the enemies\r\nof mankind would escape mention; and a searching scrutiny would show\r\nthat dishonesty has played as important, though not as manifest, a\r\npart in the operations of benevolence, as in the achievements of the\r\ndevil. But a more confined use of the word must satisfy us on the\r\npresent occasion. We are not about to enter on a philosophic inquiry\r\ninto the causes that contributed to the success of Mahomet and\r\nCromwell, but only to chronicle a few of the most humorous facts\r\nconnected with the predecessors of Dr. Townsend and Mr. Morrison.\r\n\r\nIn the success that has in every century attended the rascally\r\nenterprises of pretenders to the art of medicine, is found a touching\r\nevidence of the sorrow, credulity, and ignorance of the generations\r\nthat have passed, or are passing, to the silent home where the pain\r\nand joy, the simplicity and cunning, of this world are alike of\r\ninsignificance. The hope that to the last lurks in the breast of the\r\nveriest wretch under heaven's canopy, whether his trials come from\r\nbroken health, or an empty pocket, or wronged affection, speaks aloud\r\nin saddest tones, as one thinks of the multitudes who, worn with\r\nbodily malady and spiritual dejection, ignorant of the source of their\r\nsufferings, but thirsting for relief from them, have gone from\r\ncharlatan to charlatan, giving hoarded money in exchange for charms,\r\ncramp-rings, warming-stones, elixirs, and trochees, warranted to cure\r\nevery ill that flesh is heir to. The scene, from another point of\r\nview, is more droll, but scarcely less mournful. Look away for a few\r\nseconds from the throng of miserable objects who press round the\r\nempiric's stage; wipe out for a brief while the memory of their woes,\r\nand regard the style and arts of the practitioner who, with a trunk\r\nfull of nostrums, bids disease to vanish, and death to retire from the\r\nscenes of his triumph. There he stands--a lean, fantastic man,\r\nvoluble of tongue, empty-headed, full of loud words and menaces,\r\nprating about kings and princes who have taken him by the hand and\r\nkissed him in gratitude for his benefits showered upon them--dauntless,\r\ngreedy, and so steeped in falsehood that his crazy-tainted brain half\r\nbelieves the lies that flow from his glib tongue. Are there no such\r\nmen amongst us now--not standing on carts at the street-corners, and\r\nselling their wares to a dingy rabble, but having their seats of\r\nexchange in honoured places, and vending their prescriptions to crowds\r\nof wealthy clients?\r\n\r\nIn the feudal ages medicine and quackery were the same, as far as any\r\nprinciples of science are concerned. The only difference between the\r\nphysician and the charlatan was, that the former was a fool and the\r\nlatter a rogue. Men did not meddle much with the healing art. A few\r\nclerks devoted themselves to it, and in the exercise of their\r\nspiritual and medical functions discovered how to get two fleeces from\r\na sheep at one shearing; but the care of the sick was for the most\r\npart left to the women, who then, as in every other period of the\r\nworld's history, prided themselves on their medical cunning, and, with\r\nthe exception of intrigue, preferred attending on the sick to any\r\nother occupation. From the time of the Reformation, however, the\r\nnumber of lady doctors rapidly diminished. The fair sex gradually\r\nrelinquished the ground they had so long occupied, to men, who, had\r\nthe monastic institutions continued to exist, would have assumed the\r\npriestly garb and passed their days in sloth. Quackery was at length\r\nfairly taken out of the hands of women and the shelter of domestic\r\nlife, and was practised, not for love, and in a superstitious belief\r\nin its efficacy, but for money, and frequently with a perfect\r\nknowledge of its worthlessness as a remedial system.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the printing-press had become an institution of the\r\ncountry, and there existed a considerable proportion of the community\r\ncapable of reading, the empirics seized hold of Caxton's invention,\r\nand made it subservient to their honourable ends. The advertising\r\nsystem was had recourse to in London, during the Stuart era, scarcely\r\nless than it is now. Handbills were distributed in all directions by\r\nhalf-starved wretches, whose withered forms and pallid cheeks were of\r\nthemselves a sufficient disproof of the assertions of their employers.\r\n\r\nThe costume, language, style, and artifices of the pretenders to\r\nphysic in the seventeenth century were doubtless copied from models of\r\nlong standing, and differed little in essentials from those of their\r\npredecessors. Professions retain their characteristics with singular\r\nobstinacy. The doctor of Charles the Second's London transmitted all\r\nhis most salient features to the quack of the Regency.\r\n\r\nCotgrave, in his \"Treasury of \"Wit and Language,\" published 1655, thus\r\npaints the poor physician of his time:--\r\n\r\n    \"My name is Pulsefeel, a poor Doctor of Physick,\r\n    That does wear three pile velvet in his hat,\r\n    Has paid a quarter's rent of his house before-hand,\r\n    And (simple as he stands here) was made doctor beyond sea.\r\n    I vow, as I am right worshipful, the taking\r\n    Of my degree cost me twelve French crowns, and\r\n    Thirty-five pounds of butter in Upper Germany.\r\n    I can make your beauty, and preserve it,\r\n    Rectifie your body and maintaine it,\r\n    Clarifie your blood, surfle your cheeks, perfume\r\n    Your skin, tinct your hair, enliven your eye,\r\n    Heighten your appetite; and as for Jellies,\r\n    Dentifrizes, Dyets, Minerals, Fricasses,\r\n    Pomatums, Fumes, Italia masks to sleep in,\r\n    Either to moisten or dry the superficies, Faugh! Galen\r\n    Was a goose, and Paracelsus a Patch,\r\n    To Doctor Pulsefeel.\"\r\n\r\nThis picture would serve for the portrait of Dr. Pulsefeel in the\r\neighteenth and nineteenth, as well as the seventeenth century. How it\r\ncalls to mind the image of Oliver Goldsmith, when, with a smattering\r\nof medical knowledge, a cane, and a dubious diploma, he tried to pick\r\nout of the miseries and ignorance of his fellow-creatures the means of\r\nkeeping body and soul together! He too, poet and scholar though he\r\nwas, would have sold a pot of rouge to a faded beauty, or a bottle of\r\nhair-dye, or a nostrum warranted to cure the bite of a mad dog.\r\n\r\nA more accurate picture, however, of the charlatan, is to be found in\r\n\"The Quack's Academy; or, The Dunce's Directory,\" published in 1678,\r\nof which the following is a portion:--\r\n\r\n\"However, in the second place, to support this title, there are\r\nseveral things very convenient: of which some are external\r\naccoutrements, others internal qualifications.\r\n\r\n\"Your outward requisites are a decent black suit, and (if your credit\r\nwill stretch so far in Long Lane) a plush jacket; not a pin the worse\r\nthough threadbare as a tailor's cloak--it shows the more reverend\r\nantiquity.\r\n\r\n\"Secondly, like Mercury, you must always carry a caduceus or conjuring\r\njapan in your hand, capt with a civet-box; with which you must walk\r\nwith Spanish gravity, as in deep contemplation upon an arbitrament\r\nbetween life and death.\r\n\r\n\"Thirdly, a convenient lodging, not forgetting a hatch at the door; a\r\nchamber hung with Dutch pictures, or looking-glasses, belittered with\r\nempty bottles, gallipots, and vials filled with tapdroppings, or fair\r\nwater, coloured with saunders. Any sexton will furnish your window\r\nwith a skull, in hope of your custom; over which hang up the skeleton\r\nof a monkey, to proclaim your skill in anatomy.\r\n\r\n\"Fourthly, let your table be never without some old musty Greek or\r\nArabick author, and the 4th book of Cornelius Agrippa's 'Occult\r\nPhilosophy,' wide open to amuse spectators; with half-a-dozen of gilt\r\nshillings, as so many guineas received that morning for fees.\r\n\r\n\"Fifthly, fail not to oblige neighbouring ale-houses, to recommend you\r\nto inquirers; and hold correspondence with all the nurses and midwives\r\nnear you, to applaud your skill at gossippings.\"\r\n\r\nThe directions go on to advise loquacity and impudence, qualities\r\nwhich quacks of all times and kinds have found most useful. But in\r\ncases where the practitioner has an impediment in his speech, or\r\ncannot by training render himself glib of utterance, he is advised to\r\npersevere in a habit of mysterious silence, rendered impressive by\r\ngrave nods of the head.\r\n\r\nWhen Dr. Pulsefeel was tired of London, or felt a want of country air,\r\nhe concentrated his powers on the pleasant occupation of fleecing\r\nrustic simplicity. For his journeys into the provinces he provided\r\nhimself with a stout and fast-trotting hack--stout, that it might bear\r\nwithout fatigue weighty parcels of medicinal composition; and fleet of\r\nfoot, so that if an ungrateful rabble should commit the indecorum of\r\nstoning their benefactor as an impostor (a mishap that would\r\noccasionally occur), escape might be effected from the infatuated and\r\nexcited populace. In his circuit the doctor took in all the fairs,\r\nmarkets, wakes, and public festivals; not, however, disdaining to stop\r\nan entire week, or even month, at an assize town, where he found the\r\nsick anxious to benefit by his wisdom.\r\n\r\nHis plan of making acquaintance with a new place was to ride boldly\r\ninto the thickest crowd of a fair or market, with as much speed as he\r\ncould make without imperilling the lives of by-standers; and then,\r\nwhen he had checked his steed, inform all who listened that he had\r\ncome straight from the Duke of Bohemia, or the most Serene Emperor of\r\nWallachia, out of a desire to do good to his fellow-creatures. He was\r\nborn in that very town,--yes, that very town in which he then was\r\nspeaking, and had left it when an orphan child of eight years of age,\r\nto seek his fortune in the world. He had found his way to London, and\r\nbeen crimped on board a vessel bound for Morocco, and so had been\r\ncarried off to foreign parts. His adventures had been wonderful. He\r\nhad visited the Sultan and the Great Mogul. There was not a part of\r\nthe Indies with which he was not familiar. If any one doubted him, let\r\nhis face be regarded, and his bronze complexion bear witness of the\r\nscorching suns he had endured. He had cured hundreds--ay,\r\nthousands--of emperors, kings, queens, princes, margravines, grand\r\nduchesses, and generalissimos, of their diseases. He had a powder\r\nwhich would stay the palsy, jaundice, hot fever, and cramps. It was\r\nexpensive; but that he couldn't help, for it was made of pearls, and\r\nthe dried leaves of violets brought from the very middle of Tartary;\r\nstill he could sell a packet of the medicine for a crown--a sum which\r\nwould just pay him back his outlaid money, and leave him no profit.\r\nBut he didn't want to make money of them. He was their fellow-townsman;\r\nand in order to find them out and cure them he had refused offers of\r\nwealth from the king of Mesopotamia, who wanted him to accept a\r\nfortune of a thousand gold pieces a month, tarry with the\r\nMesopotamians, and keep them out of Death's clutches. Sometimes this\r\nharangue was made from the back of a horse; sometimes from a rude\r\nhustings, from which he was called _mountebank_. He sold all kinds of\r\nmedicaments: dyes for the hair, washes for the complexion, lotions to\r\nkeep young men youthful; rings which, when worn on the fore-finger of\r\nthe right hand, should make a chosen favourite desperately in love\r\nwith the wearer, and when worn on the same finger of the left hand,\r\nshould drive the said favourite to commit suicide. Nothing could\r\nsurpass the impudence of the fellow's lies, save the admiration with\r\nwhich his credulous auditors swallowed his assertions. There they\r\nstood,--stout yeomen, drunken squires, merry peasant girls, gawky\r\nhinds, gabbling dames, deeming themselves in luck's way to have lived\r\nto see such a miracle of learning. Possibly a young student home from\r\nOxford, with the rashness of inexperience, would smile scornfully, and\r\nin a loud voice designate the pretender a quack--a quacksalvar\r\n(kwabzalver), from the liniment he vended for the cure of wens. But\r\nsuch an interruption, in ninety and nine cases out of every hundred,\r\nwas condemned by the orthodox friends of the young student, and he\r\nwas warned that he would come to no good if he went on as he had\r\nbegun--a contemptuous unbeliever, and a mocker of wise men.\r\n\r\nThe author of the \"Discourse de l'Origine des Mœurs, Fraudes, et\r\nImpostures des Ciarlatans, avec leur Découverte, Paris, 1662,\" says,\r\n\"Premièrement, par ce mot de Ciarlatans, j'entens ceux que les\r\nItaliens appellent Saltambaci, basteleurs, bouffons, vendeurs de\r\nbagatelles, et generalement toute autre personne, laquelle en place\r\npublique montée en banc, à terre, ou à cheval, vend medecines, baumes,\r\nhuilles ou poudres, composées pour guerir quelque infirmité, louant et\r\nexaltant sa drogue, avec artifice, et mille faux sermens, en racontant\r\nmille et mille merveilles.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Mais c'est chose plaisante de voir l'artifice dont se servent ces\r\nmedecins de banc pour vendre leur drogue, quand avec mille faux\r\nsermens ils affirment d'avoir appris leur secret du roi de Dannemarc,\r\nau d'un prince de Transilvanie.\"\r\n\r\nThe great quack of Charles the Second's London was Dr. Thomas Saffold.\r\nThis man (who was originally a weaver) professed to cure every disease\r\nof the human body, and also to foretell the destinies of his patients.\r\nAlong Cheapside, Fleet-street, and the Strand, even down to the sacred\r\nprecincts of Whitehall and St. James's, he stationed bill-distributors,\r\nwho showered prose and poetry on the passers-by--just as the agents\r\n(possibly the poets) of the Messrs. Moses cast their literature on the\r\ntown of Queen Victoria. When this great benefactor of his species\r\ndeparted this life, on May the 12th, 1691, a satirical broadsheet\r\ncalled on the world to mourn for the loss of one--\r\n\r\n    \"So skilled in drugs and verse, 'twas hard to show it,\r\n    Whether was best, the doctor or the poet.\"\r\n\r\nThe ode continues:--\r\n\r\n    \"Lament, ye damsels of our London city,\r\n    (Poor unprovided girls) tho' fair and witty,\r\n    Who, maskt, would to his house in couples come,\r\n    To understand your matrimonial doom;\r\n    To know what kind of men you were to marry,\r\n    And how long time, poor things, you were to tarry;\r\n    Your oracle is silent, none can tell\r\n    On whom his astrologick mantle fell:\r\n    For he when sick refused all doctors' aid,\r\n    And only to his pills devotion paid!\r\n    Yet it was surely a most sad disaster,\r\n    The saucy pills at last should kill their master.\"\r\n\r\n                   EPITAPH.\r\n\r\n    \"Here lies the corpse of Thomas Saffold,\r\n    By death, in spite of physick, baffled;\r\n    Who, leaving off his working loom,\r\n    Did learned doctor soon become.\r\n    To poetry he made pretence,\r\n    Too plain to any man's own sense;\r\n    But he when living thought it sin\r\n    To hide his talent in napkin;\r\n    Now death does doctor (poet) crowd\r\n    Within the limits of a shroud.\"\r\n\r\nThe vocation of fortune-teller was exercised not only by the quacks,\r\nbut also by the apothecaries, of that period. Garth had ample\r\nfoundation, in fact, for his satirical sketch of Horoscope's shop in\r\nthe second canto of \"The Dispensary.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Long has he been of that amphibious fry,\r\n    Bold to prescribe and busie to apply;\r\n    His shop the gazing vulgars' eyes employs,\r\n    With foreign trinkets and domestick toys.\r\n    Here mummies lay most reverendly stale,\r\n    And there the tortoise hung her coat of mail.\r\n    Not far from some huge shark's devouring head\r\n    The flying fish their finny pinions spread;\r\n    Aloft in rows large poppy-heads were strung,\r\n    And near a scaly alligator hung;\r\n    In this place, drugs in musty heaps decay'd,\r\n    In that, dry'd bladders and drawn teeth were laid.\r\n\r\n    \"An inner room receives the num'rous shoals\r\n    Of such as pay to be reputed fools;\r\n    Globes stand by globes, volumes by volumes lye,\r\n    And planetary schemes amuse the eye.\r\n    The sage, in velvet chair, here lolls at ease,\r\n    To promise future health for present fees.\r\n    Then, as from Tripod, solemn shams reveals,\r\n    And what the stars know nothing of reveals.\r\n\r\n    \"One asks how soon Panthea may be won,\r\n    And longs to feel the marriage fetters on;\r\n    Others, convinced by melancholy proof,\r\n    Enquire when courteous fates will strike them off;\r\n    Some by what means they may redress the wrong,\r\n    When fathers the possession keep too long;\r\n    And some would know the issue of their cause,\r\n    And whether gold can solder up its flaws.\r\n          .      .      .      .      .\r\n    \"Whilst Iris his cosmetick wash would try,\r\n    To make her bloom revive, and lovers die;\r\n    Some ask for charms, and others philters choose,\r\n    To gain Corinna, and their quartans lose.\"\r\n\r\nQueen Anne's weak eyes caused her to pass from one empiric to another,\r\nfor the relief they all promised to give, and in some cases even\r\npersuaded that they gave her. She had a passion for quack oculists;\r\nand happy was the advertising scoundrel who gained her Majesty's\r\nfavour with a new collyrium. For, of course, if the greatest personage\r\nin the land said that Professor Bungalo was a wonderful man, a master\r\nof his art, and inspired by God to heal the sick, there was no appeal\r\nfrom so eminent an authority. How should an elderly lady with a crown\r\non her head be mistaken? Do we not hear the same arguments every day\r\nin our own enlightened generation, when the new Chiropodist, or\r\nRubber, or inventor of a specific for consumption, points to the\r\nsocial distinctions of his dupes as conclusive evidence that he is\r\nneither supported by vulgar ignorance, nor afraid to meet the most\r\nsearching scrutiny of the educated? Good Queen Anne was so charmed\r\nwith two of the many knaves who by turns enjoyed her countenance, that\r\nshe had them sworn in as her own oculists in ordinary; and one of them\r\nshe was even so silly as to knight. This lucky gentleman was William\r\nReade, originally a botching tailor, and to the last a very ignorant\r\nman, as his \"Short and Exact Account of all Diseases Incident to the\r\nEyes\" attests; yet he rose to the honour of knighthood, and the most\r\nlucrative and fashionable physician's practice of his period. Surely\r\nevery dog has his day. Lazarus never should despair; a turn of fortune\r\nmay one fine day pick him from the rags which cover his nakedness in\r\nthe kennel, and put him to feast amongst princes, arrayed in purple\r\nand fine linen, and regarded as an oracle of wisdom. It was true that\r\nSir William Reade was unable to read the book which he had written (by\r\nthe hand of an amanuensis), but I have no doubt that many worthy\r\npeople who listened to his sonorous voice, beheld his lace ruffles and\r\ngold-headed cane, and saw his coach drawn along to St. James's by\r\nsuperb horses, thought him in every respect equal, or even superior,\r\nto Pope and Swift.\r\n\r\nWhen Sir William was knighted he hired a poet, who lived in Grub\r\nStreet, to announce the fact to posterity and \"the town,\" in\r\ndecasyllabic verse. The production of this bard, \"The Oculist, a\r\nPoem,\" was published in the year 1705, and has already (thanks to the\r\nBritish Museum, which like the nets of fishermen receiveth of \"all\r\nsorts\") endowed with a century and a half of posthumous renown; and\r\nno one can deny that so much fame is due, both to the man who bought,\r\nand the scribbler who sold the following strain:--\r\n\r\n    \"Whilst Britain's Sovereign scales such worth has weighed,\r\n    And Anne herself her smiling favours paid,\r\n    That sacred hand does your fair chaplet twist,\r\n    Great Reade her own entitled Oculist,\r\n    With this fair mark of honour, sir, assume\r\n    No common trophies from this shining plume;\r\n    Her favours by desert are only shared--\r\n    Her smiles are not her gift, but her reward.\r\n    Thus in your new fair plumes of Honour drest,\r\n    To hail the Royal Foundress of the feast;\r\n    When the great Anne's warm smiles this favourite raise,\r\n    'Tis not a royal grace she gives, but pays.\"\r\n\r\nQueen Anne's other \"sworn oculist,\" as he and Reade termed themselves,\r\nwas Roger Grant, a cobbler and Anabaptist preacher. He was a\r\nprodigiously vain man, even for a quack, and had his likeness engraved\r\nin copper. Impressions of the plate were distributed amongst his\r\nfriends, but were not in all cases treated with much respect; for one\r\nof those who had been complimented with a present of the eminent\r\noculist's portrait, fixed it on a wall of his house, having first\r\nadorned it with the following lines:--\r\n\r\n    \"See here a picture of a brazen face,\r\n    The fittest lumber of this wretched place.\r\n    A tinker first his scene of life began;\r\n    That failing, he set up for cunning man;\r\n    But wanting luck, puts on a new disguise,\r\n    And now pretends that he can mend your eyes;\r\n    But this expect, that, like a tinker true,\r\n    Where he repairs one eye he puts out two.\"\r\n\r\nThe charge of his being a tinker was preferred against him also by\r\nanother lampoon writer. \"In his stead up popped Roger Grant, the\r\ntinker, of whom a friend of mine once sung.--\r\n\r\n    \"'Her Majesty sure was in a surprise,\r\n      Or else was very short-sighted;\r\n    When a tinker was sworn to look after her eyes,\r\n      And the mountebank Reade was knighted.'\"\r\n\r\nThis man, according to the custom of his class, was in the habit of\r\npublishing circumstantial and minute accounts of his cures. Of course\r\nhis statements were a tissue of untruths, with just the faintest\r\npossible admixture of what was not altogether false. His plan was to\r\nget hold of some poor person of imperfect vision, and, after treating\r\nhim with medicines and half-crowns for six weeks, induce him to sign a\r\ntestimonial to the effect that he had been born stone-blind, and had\r\nnever enjoyed any visual power whatever, till Providence led him to\r\ngood Dr. Grant, who had cured him in little more than a month. This\r\ncertificate the clergyman and churchwardens of the parish, in which\r\nthe patient had been known to wander about the streets in mendicancy,\r\nwere asked to attest; and if they proved impregnable to the cunning\r\nrepresentations of the importunate suitors, and declined to give the\r\nevidence of their handwriting, either on the ground that they had\r\nreason to question the fact of the original blindness, or because they\r\nwere not thoroughly acquainted with the particulars of the case, Dr.\r\nGrant did not scruple to sign their names himself, or by the hands of\r\nhis agents. The _modus operandi_ with which he carried out these\r\nfrauds may be learned by the curious in a pamphlet, published in the\r\nyear 1709, and entitled \"A Full and True Account of a Miraculous Cure\r\nof a Young Man in Newington that was Born Blind.\"\r\n\r\nBut the last century was rife with medical quacks. The Rev. John\r\nHancocke, D.D., Rector of St. Margaret's, Lothbury, London,\r\nPrebendary of Canterbury, and chaplain to the Duke of Bedford,\r\npreached up the water-cure, which Pliny the naturalist described as\r\nbeing in his day the fashionable remedy in Rome. He published a work\r\nin 1723 that immediately became popular, called \"Febrifugum Magnum;\r\nor, Common Water the best Cure for Fevers, and probably for the\r\nPlague.\"\r\n\r\nThe good man deemed himself a genius of the highest order, because he\r\nhad discovered that a draught of cold water, under certain\r\ncircumstances, is a powerful diaphoretic. His pharmacopeia, however,\r\ncontained another remedy--namely, stewed prunes, which the Doctor\r\nregarded as a specific in obstinate cases of blood-spitting. Then\r\nthere was Ward, with his famous pill, whose praises that learned man,\r\nLord Chief Baron Reynolds, sounded in every direction. There was also\r\na tar-water mania, which mastered the clear intellect of Henry\r\nFielding, and had as its principal advocate the supreme intellect of\r\nthe age, Bishop Berkeley. In volume eighteen of the _Gentleman's\r\nMagazine_ is a list of the quack-doctors then practising; and the\r\nnumber of those named in it is almost as numerous as the nostrums,\r\nwhich mount up to 202. These accommodating fellows were ready to\r\nfleece every rank of society. The fashionable impostor sold his\r\nspecific sometimes at the rate of 2_s._ 6_d._ a pill, while the\r\nhumbler knave vended his boluses at 6_d._ a box. To account for\r\nsociety tolerating, and yet more, warmly encouraging such a state of\r\nthings, we must remember the force of the example set by eminent\r\nphysicians in vending medicines the composition of which they kept\r\nsecret. Sir Hans Sloane sold an eye-salve; and Dr. Mead had a\r\nfavourite nostrum--a powder for the bite of a mad dog.\r\n\r\nThe close of the seventeenth century was not in respect of its quacks\r\nbehind the few preceding generations. In 1789 Mr. and Mrs.\r\nLoutherbourg became notorious for curing people without medicine. God,\r\nthey proclaimed, had endowed them with a miraculous power of healing\r\nthe impoverished sick, by looking upon them and touching them. Of\r\ncourse every one who presumed to doubt the statement was regarded as\r\ncalling in question the miracles of holy writ, and was exclaimed\r\nagainst as an infidel. The doctor's house was besieged with enormous\r\ncrowds. The good man and his lady refused to take any fee whatever,\r\nand issued gratuitous tickets amongst the mob, which would admit the\r\nbearers into the Loutherbourgian presence. Strange to say, however,\r\nthese tickets found their way into the hands of venal people, who sold\r\nthem to others in the crowd (who were tired of waiting) for sums\r\nvarying from two to five guineas each; and ere long it was discovered\r\nthat these barterers of the healing power were accomplices in the pay\r\nof the poor man's friend. A certain Miss Mary Pratt, in all\r\nprobability a puppet acting in obedience to Loutherbourg's\r\ninstructions, wrote an account of the cures performed by the physician\r\nand his wife. In a dedicatory letter to the Archbishop of Canterbury,\r\nMiss Pratt says:--\"I therefore presume when these testimonies are\r\nsearched into (which will corroborate with mine) your Lordship will\r\ncompose a form of prayer, to be used in all churches and chapels, that\r\nnothing may impede or prevent this inestimable gift from having its\r\nfree course; and publick thanks may be offered up in all churches and\r\nchapels, for such an astonishing proof of God's love to this favoured\r\nland.\" The publication frankly states that \"Mr. De Loutherbourg, who\r\nlives on Hammersmith Green, has received a most glorious power from\r\nthe Lord Jehovah--viz. the gift of healing all manner of diseases\r\nincident to the human body, such as blindness, deafness, lameness,\r\ncancers, loss of speech, palsies.\" But the statements of \"cases\" are\r\nyet more droll. The reader will enjoy the perusal of a few of them.\r\n\r\n\"_Case of Thomas Robinson._--Thomas Robinson was sent home to his\r\nparents at the sign of the Ram, a public-house in Cow Cross, so ill\r\nwith what is called the king's evil, that they applied for leave to\r\nbring him into St Bartholomew's Hospital.\" (Of course he was\r\ndischarged as \"incurable,\" and was eventually restored to health by\r\nMr. Loutherbourg.) \"But how,\" continues Miss Pratt, \"shall my pen\r\npaint ingratitude? The mother had procured a ticket for him from the\r\nFinsbury Dispensary, and with a shameful reluctance denied having seen\r\nMr De Loutherbourg, waited on the kind gentleman belonging to the\r\ndispensary, and, _amazing_! thanked them for relief which they had no\r\nhand in; for she told me and fifty more, she took the drugs and\r\nmedicines and threw them away, reserving the phials, &c. Such an\r\nimposition on the public ought to be detected, as she deprived other\r\npoor people of those medicines which might have been useful; not only\r\nso--robbed the Lord of Life of the glory due to him only, by returning\r\nthanks at the dispensary for a cure which they had never performed.\r\nThe lad is now under Mr De Loutherbourg's care, who administered to\r\nhim before me yesterday in the public healing-room, amongst a large\r\nconcourse of people, amongst whom was some of the first families in\r\nthe kingdom.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Case.--Mary Ann Hughes._--Her father is chairman to her Grace the\r\nDuchess of Rutland, who lives at No. 37, in Ogle Street. She had a\r\nmost violent fever, _fell into her knee_, went to Middlesex Hospital,\r\nwhere they made every experiment in order to cure her--but in vain;\r\nshe came home worse than she went in, her leg contracted and useless.\r\nIn this deplorable state she waited on Mrs De Loutherbourg, who, with\r\ninfinite condescension, saw her, administered to her, and the second\r\ntime of waiting on Mrs De Loutherbourg she was perfectly cured.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Case.--Mrs Hook._--Mrs Hook, Stableyard, St James's, has two\r\ndaughters born deaf and dumb. She waited on the lady above-mentioned,\r\n_who looked on them with an eye of benignity, and healed them_. (I\r\nheard them both speak.)\"\r\n\r\nMary Pratt, after enumerating several cases like the foregoing,\r\nconcludes thus:\r\n\r\n\"Let me repeat, with horror and detestation, the wickedness of those\r\nwho have procured tickets of admission, and sold them for five and two\r\nguineas apiece!--whereas this gift was chiefly intended for the poor.\r\nTherefore Mr De Loutherbourg has retired from the practice into the\r\ncountry (for the present), having suffered all the indignities and\r\ncontumely that man could suffer, joined to ungrateful behaviour, and\r\ntumultuous proceedings. I have heard people curse him and threaten his\r\nlife, instead of returning him thanks; and it is my humble wish that\r\nprayers may be put up in all churches for his great gifts to\r\nmultiply.\"\r\n\r\n                                    \"FINIS.\r\n\r\n\"Report says three thousand persons have waited for tickets at a\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\nForming a portion of this interesting work by Miss Pratt is a\r\ndescription of a case which throws the Loutherbourgian miracles into\r\nthe shade, and is apparently cited only for the insight it affords\r\ninto the state of public feeling in Queen Anne's time, as contrasted\r\nwith the sceptical enlightenment of George III.'s reign:--\r\n\r\n\"I hope the public will allow me to adduce a case which history will\r\nevince the truth of. A girl, whose father and mother were French\r\nrefugees, had her hip dislocated from her birth. She was apprentice to\r\na milliner, and obliged to go out about the mistress's business; the\r\nboys used to insult her for her lameness continually, as she limped\r\nvery much.... Providence directed her to read one of the miracles\r\nperformed by our blessed Saviour concerning the withered arm. The girl\r\nexclaimed, 'Oh, madam, was Jesus here on earth he would cure me.' Her\r\nmistress answered, 'If you have faith, his power is the same now.' She\r\nimmediately cried, 'I have faith!' and the bone flew into its place\r\nwith a report like the noise of a pistol. The girl's joy was ecstatic.\r\nShe jumped about the room in raptures. The servant was called, sent\r\nfor her parents, and the minister under whom she sat. They spent the\r\nnight praising God. Hundreds came to see her, amongst whom was the\r\nBishop of London, by the command of her Majesty Queen Anne (for in\r\nthose days people were astonished at this great miracle.)\"\r\n\r\nDr. Loutherbourg was not the first quack to fleece the good people of\r\nHammersmith. In the 572nd paper of the _Spectator_, dated July 26,\r\n1714, there is a good story of a consummate artist, who surrounded\r\nhimself with an enormous crowd, and assured them that Hammersmith was\r\nthe place of his nativity; and that, out of strong natural affection\r\nfor his birth-place, he was willing to give each of its inhabitants a\r\npresent of five shillings. After this exordium, the benevolent fellow\r\nproduced from his cases an immense number of packets of a powder\r\nwarranted to cure everything and kill nothing. The price of each\r\npacket was properly five shillings and sixpence; but out of love for\r\nthe people of Hammersmith the good doctor offered to let any of his\r\naudience buy them at the rate of sixpence apiece. The multitude\r\navailed themselves of this proposition to such an extent that it is to\r\nbe feared the friend of Hammersmith's humanity suffered greatly from\r\nhis liberality.\r\n\r\nSteele has transmitted to us some capital anecdotes of the empirics of\r\nhis day. One doctor of Sir Richard's acquaintance resided in Moore\r\nAlley, near Wapping, and proclaimed his ability to cure cataracts,\r\n_because he had lost an eye in the emperor's service_. To his patients\r\nhe was in the habit of displaying, as a conclusive proof of his\r\nsurgical prowess, a muster-roll showing that either he, or a man of\r\nhis name, had been in one of his imperial Majesty's regiments. At the\r\nsight of this document of course mistrust fled. Another man professed\r\nto treat ruptured children, because his father and grandfather were\r\nborn bursten. But more humorous even than either of these gentlemen\r\nwas another friend of Sir Richard's, who announced to the public that\r\n\"from eight to twelve and from two till six, he attended for the good\r\nof the public to bleed for threepence.\"\r\n\r\nThe fortunes which pretenders to the healing art have amassed would\r\njustify a belief that empiricism, under favourable circumstances, is\r\nthe best trade to be found in the entire list of industrial\r\noccupations. Quacks have in all ages found staunch supporters amongst\r\nthe powerful and affluent. Dr. Myersbach, whom Lettsom endeavoured to\r\ndrive back into obscurity, continued, long after the publication of\r\nthe \"Observations,\" to make a large income out of the credulity of the\r\nfashionable classes of English society. Without learning of any kind,\r\nthis man raised himself to opulence. His degree was bought at Erfurth\r\nfor a few shillings, just before that university raised the prices of\r\nits academical distinctions, in consequence of the pleasant raillery\r\nof a young Englishman, who paid the fees for a Doctor's diploma, and\r\nhad it duly recorded in the Collegiate archives as having been\r\npresented to Anglicus Ponto; Ponto being no other than his mastiff\r\ndog. With such a degree Myersbach set up for a philosopher. Patients\r\ncrowded to his consulting-room, and those who were unable to come sent\r\ntheir servants with descriptions of their cases. But his success was\r\nless than that of the inventor of Ailhaud's powders, which ran their\r\ndevastating course through every country in Europe, sending to the\r\nsilence of the grave almost as many thousands as were destroyed in all\r\nNapoleon's campaigns. Tissot, in his \"Avis au Peuple,\" published in\r\n1803, attacked Ailhaud with characteristic vehemence, and put an end\r\nto his destructive power; but ere this took place the charlatan had\r\nmounted on his slaughtered myriads to the possession of three\r\nbaronies, and was figuring in European courts as the Baron de\r\nCastelet.\r\n\r\nThe tricks which these practitioners have had recourse to for the\r\nattainment of their ends are various. Dr. Katterfelto, who rose into\r\neminence upon the evil wind that brought the influenza to England in\r\nthe year 1782, always travelled about the country in a large caravan,\r\ncontaining a number of black cats. This gentleman's triumphant\r\ncampaign was brought to a disastrous termination by the mayor of\r\nShrewsbury, who gave him a taste of the sharp discipline provided at\r\nthat time by the law for rogues and vagabonds.--\"The Wise Man of\r\nLiverpool,\" whose destiny it was to gull the canny inhabitants of the\r\nNorth of England, used to traverse the country in a chariot drawn by\r\nsix horses, attended by a perfect army of outriders in brilliant\r\nliveries, and affecting all the pomp of a prince of the royal blood.\r\n\r\nThe quacks who merit severe punishment the least of all their order\r\nare those who, while they profess to exercise a powerful influence\r\nover the bodies of their patients, leave nature to pursue her\r\noperations pretty much in her own way. Of this comparatively harmless\r\nclass was Atwell, the parson of St. Tue, who, according to the account\r\ngiven of him by Fuller, in his English Worthies, \"although he now and\r\nthen used blood-letting, mostly for all diseases prescribed milk, and\r\noften milk and apples, which (although contrary to the judgments of\r\nthe best-esteemed practitioners) either by virtue of the medicine, or\r\nfortune of the physician, or fancy of the patient, recovered many out\r\nof desperate extremities.\" Atwell won his reputation by acting on the\r\nsame principle that has brought a certain degree of popularity to the\r\nhomœopathists--that, namely, of letting things run their own\r\ncourse. The higher order of empirics have always availed themselves of\r\nthe wonderful faculty possessed by nature of taking good care of\r\nherself. Simple people who enlarge on the series of miraculous cures\r\nperformed by their pet charlatan, and find in them proofs of his\r\nhonesty and professional worth, do not reflect that in ninety-and-nine\r\ncases out of every hundred where a sick person is restored to health,\r\nthe result is achieved by nature rather than art, and would have been\r\narrived at as speedily without as with medicine. Again, the fame of an\r\nordinary medical practitioner is never backed up by simple and\r\ncompound addition. His cures and half cures are never summed up to\r\nmagnificent total by his employers, and then flaunted about on a\r\nbright banner before the eyes of the electors. 'Tis a mere matter of\r\ncourse that _he_ (although he _is_ quite wrong, and knows not half as\r\nmuch about his art as any great lady who has tested the efficacy of\r\nthe new system on her sick poodle) should cure people. 'Tis only the\r\ncause of globules which is to be supported by documentary evidence,\r\ncontaining the case of every young lady who has lost a severe headache\r\nunder the benign influence of an infinitesimal dose of flour and\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nDumoulin, the physician, observed at his death that \"he left behind\r\nhim two great physicians, Regimen and River Water.\" A due appreciation\r\nof the truth embodied in this remark, coupled with that masterly\r\nassurance, without which the human family is not to be fleeced,\r\nenabled the French quack, Villars, to do good to others and to himself\r\nat the same time. This man, in 1723, confided to his friends that his\r\nuncle, who had recently been killed by an accident at the advanced age\r\nof one hundred years, had bequeathed to him the recipe for a nostrum\r\nwhich would prolong the life of any one who used it to a hundred and\r\nfifty, provided only that the rules of sobriety were never\r\ntransgressed. Whenever a funeral passed him in the street he said\r\naloud, \"Ah! if that unfortunate creature had taken my nostrum, he\r\nmight be carrying that coffin, instead of being carried in it.\" This\r\nnostrum was composed of nitre and Seine water, and was sold at the\r\nridiculously cheap rate of five francs a bottle. Those who bought it\r\nwere directed to drink it at certain stated periods, and also to lead\r\nregular lives, to eat moderately, drink temperately, take plenty of\r\nbodily exercise, go to and rise from bed early, and to avoid mental\r\nanxiety. In an enormous majority of cases the patient was either cured\r\nor benefitted. Some possibly died, who, by the ministrations of\r\nscience, might have been preserved from the grave. But in these cases,\r\nand doubtless they were few, the blunder was set down to Nature, who,\r\nsomewhat unjustly, was never credited with any of the recoveries. The\r\nworld was charitable, and the doctor could say--\r\n\r\n    \"The grave my faults does hide,\r\n      The world my cures does see;\r\n    What youth and time provide,\r\n      Are oft ascribed to me.\"\r\n\r\nAnyhow Villars succeeded, and won the approbation not only of his\r\ndupes, but of those also who were sagacious enough to see the nature\r\nof his trick. The Abbe Pons declared him to be the superior of the\r\nmarshal of the same name. \"The latter,\" said he, \"kills men--the\r\nformer prolongs their existence.\" At length Villars' secret leaked\r\nout; and his patients, unwise in coming to him, unwisely deserted him.\r\nHis occupation was gone.\r\n\r\nThe displeasure of Villars' dupes, on the discovery of the benevolent\r\nhoax played upon them, reminds us of a good story. Some years since,\r\nat a fashionable watering-place, on the south-east coast of England,\r\nresided a young surgeon--handsome, well-bred, and of most pleasant\r\naddress. He was fast rising into public favour and a good practice,\r\nwhen an eccentric and wealthy maiden lady, far advanced in years, sent\r\nfor him. The summons of course was promptly obeyed, and the young\r\npractitioner was soon listening to a most terrible story of suffering.\r\nThe afflicted lady, according to her own account, had a year before,\r\nduring the performance of her toilet, accidentally taken into her\r\nthroat one of the bristles of her tooth-brush. This bristle had stuck\r\nin the top of the gullet, and set up an irritation which, she was\r\nconvinced, was killing her. She had been from one surgeon of eminence\r\nto another, and everywhere in London and in the country the Faculty\r\nhad assured her that she was only the victim of a nervous\r\ndelusion--that her throat was in a perfectly healthy condition--that\r\nthe disturbance existed only in her own imagination. \"And so they go\r\non, the stupid, obstinate, perverse, unfeeling creatures,\" concluded\r\nthe poor lady, \"saying there is nothing the matter with me, while I\r\nam--dying--dying--dying!\" \"Allow me, my dear lady,\" said the adroit\r\nsurgeon in reply, \"to inspect for myself--carefully--the state of\r\nyour throat.\" The inspection was made gravely, and at much length. \"My\r\ndear Miss ----,\" resumed the surgeon, when he had concluded his\r\nexamination, \"you are quite right, and Sir Benjamin Brodie and Sir\r\nJames Clark are wrong. I can see the head of the bristle low down,\r\nalmost out of sight; and if you'll let me run home for my instruments,\r\nI'll forthwith extract it for you.\" The adroit man retired, and in a\r\nfew minutes re-entered the room, armed with a very delicate pair of\r\nforceps, into the teeth of which he had inserted a bristle taken from\r\nan ordinary tooth-brush. The rest can be imagined. The lady threw back\r\nher head; the forceps were introduced into her mouth; a prick--a\r\nscream! and 'twas all over; and the surgeon, with a smiling face, was\r\nholding up to the light, and inspecting with lively curiosity, the\r\nextracted bristle. The patient was in raptures at a result that proved\r\nthat she was right, and Sir Benjamin Brodie wrong. She immediately\r\nrecovered her health and spirits, and went about everywhere sounding\r\nthe praises of \"her saviour,\" as she persisted in calling the\r\ndexterous operator. So enthusiastic was her gratitude, she offered him\r\nher hand in marriage and her noble fortune. The fact that the young\r\nsurgeon was already married was an insuperable obstacle to this\r\narrangement. But other proofs of gratitude the lady lavishly showered\r\non him. She compelled him to accept a carriage and horses, a service\r\nof plate, and a new house. Unfortunately the lucky fellow could not\r\nkeep his own counsel. Like foolish Samson with Delilah, he imparted\r\nthe secret of his cunning to the wife of his bosom; she confided it to\r\nLouise Clarissa, her especial friend, who had been her bridesmaid;\r\nLouise Clarissa told it under vows of inviolable secrecy to six other\r\nparticular friends; and the six other particular friends--base and\r\nunworthy girls!--told it to all the world. Ere long the story came\r\nround to the lady herself. Then what a storm arose! She was in a\r\ntransport of fury! It was of no avail for the surgeon to remind her\r\nthat he had unquestionably raised her from a pitiable condition to\r\nhealth and happiness. That mattered not. He had tricked, fooled,\r\nbamboozled her! She would not forgive him, she would pursue him with\r\nundying vengeance, she would ruin him! The writer of these pages is\r\nhappy to know that the surgeon here spoken of, whose prosperous career\r\nhas been adorned by much genuine benevolence, though unforgiven, was\r\nnot ruined.\r\n\r\nThe ignorant are remarkable alike for suspicion and credulity; and the\r\nquack makes them his prey by lulling to sleep the former quality, and\r\nartfully arousing and playing upon the latter. Whatever the field of\r\nquackery may be, the dupe must ever be the same. Some years since a\r\ncanny drover, from the north of the Tweed, gained a high reputation\r\nthroughout the Eastern Counties for selling at high prices the beasts\r\nintrusted to him as a salesman. At Norwich and Earl Soham, at Bury and\r\nIpswich, the story was the same--Peter M'Dougal invariably got more\r\nper head for \"a lot\" than even his warmest admirers had calculated he\r\nwould obtain. He managed his business so well, that his brethren,\r\nunable to compete with him, came to a conclusion not altogether\r\nsupported by the facts of the case, but flattering to their own\r\nself-love. Clearly Peter could only surpass them by such a long\r\ndistance, through the agency of some charm or witch's secret. They\r\nhinted as much; and Peter wisely accepted the suggestion, with a\r\nhalf-assenting nod of cunning, and encouraged his mates to believe in\r\nit. A year or so passed on, and it was generally allowed that Peter\r\nM'Dougal was in league on honourable terms with the unseen world. To\r\ncontend with him was useless. The only line open to his would-be\r\nimitators was to buy from him participations in his mysterious powers.\r\n\"Peter,\" at length said a simple southern, at the close of Halesworth\r\ncattle-fair, acting as spokesman for himself and four other\r\nconspirators, \"lets us into yer secret, man. Yer ha' made here twelve\r\npun a yead by a lot that aren't woth sex. How ded yer doo it? We are\r\nall owld friens. Lets us goo to 'Th' Alter'd Case,' an I an my mets\r\null stan yar supper an a dead drunk o' whiskey or rom poonch, so be\r\nyar jine hans to giv us the wink.\" Peter's eyes twinkled. He liked a\r\ngood supper and plenty of hot grog at a friend's expense. Indeed, of\r\nsuch fare, like Sheridan with wine, he was ready to take any given\r\nquantity. The bargain was made, and an immediate adjournment effected\r\nto the public-house rejoicing in the title of \"The Case is Altered.\"\r\nThe supper was of hot steak-pudding, made savoury with pepper and\r\nonions. Peter M'Dougal ate plentifully and deliberately. Slowly also\r\nhe drank two stiff tumblers of whiskey punch, smoking his pipe\r\nmeanwhile without uttering a word. The second tumbler was followed by\r\na third, and as he sipped the latter half of it, his entertainers\r\nclosed round him, and intimated that their part of the contract being\r\naccomplished, he, as a man of honour, ought to fulfill his. Peter was\r\na man of few words, and without any unnecessary prelude or comment, he\r\nstated in one laconic speech the secret of his professional success.\r\nLaying down his pipe by his empty glass, and emitting from his gray\r\neyes a light of strange humour, he said drily, \"Ye'd knoo hoo it was I\r\ncam to mak sae guid a sale o' my beasties? Weel, I ken it was joost\r\nthis--_I fund a fule!_\"\r\n\r\nThe drover who rises to be a capitalist, and the lawyer who mounts to\r\nthe woolsack, ascend by the same process. They know how to find out\r\nfools, and how to turn their discoveries to advantage.\r\n\r\nIt is told of a Barbadoes physician and slaveholder, that having been\r\nrobbed to a serious extent in his sugar-works, he discovered the thief\r\nby the following ingenious artifice. Having called his slaves\r\ntogether, he addressed them thus:--\"My friends, the great serpent\r\nappeared to me during the night, and told me that the person who stole\r\nmy money should, at this instant--_this very instant_--have a parrot's\r\nfeather at the point of his nose.\" On this announcement, the dishonest\r\nthief, anxious to find out if his guilt had declared itself, put his\r\nfinger to his nose. \"Man,\" cried the master instantly, \"'tis thou who\r\nhast robbed me. The great serpent has just told me so.\"\r\n\r\nClearly this piece of quackery succeeded, because the quack had \"fund\r\na fule.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nJOHN RADCLIFFE.\r\n\r\n\r\nRadcliffe, the Jacobite partisan, the physician without learning, and\r\nthe luxurious _bon-vivant_, who grudged the odd sixpences of his\r\ntavern scores, was born at Wakefield in Yorkshire, in the year 1650.\r\nHis extraction was humble, his father being only a well-to-do yeoman.\r\nIn after life, when he lived on intimate terms with the leading\r\nnobility of the country, he put in a claim for aristocratic descent;\r\nand the Earl of Derwentwater recognized him as a kinsman deriving his\r\nblood from the Radcliffes of Dilston, in the county of Northumberland,\r\nthe chiefs of which honourable family had been knights, barons, and\r\nearls, from the time of Henry IV. It may be remembered that a similar\r\ncountenance was given to Burke's patrician pretensions, which have\r\nbeen related by more than one biographer, with much humorous pomp. In\r\nRadcliffe's case the Heralds interfered with the Earl's decision; for\r\nafter the physician's decease they admonished the University of Oxford\r\nnot to erect any escutcheon over or upon his monument. But though\r\nRadcliffe was a plebeian, he contrived, by his shrewd humour,\r\narrogant simplicity, and immeasurable insolence, to hold both Whigs\r\nand Tories in his grasp. The two factions of the aristocracy bowed\r\nbefore him--the Tories from affection to a zealous adherent of regal\r\nabsolutism; and the Whigs, from a superstitious belief in his remedial\r\nskill, and a fear that in their hours of need he would leave them to\r\nthe advances of Death.\r\n\r\nAt the age of fifteen he became a member of the University College,\r\nOxford; and having kept his terms there, he took his B. A. degree in\r\n1669, and was made senior-scholar of the college. But no fellowship\r\nfalling vacant there, he accepted one on the foundation of Lincoln\r\nCollege. His M. B. degree he took in 1675, and forthwith obtained\r\nconsiderable practice in Oxford. Owing to a misunderstanding with Dr.\r\nMarshall, the rector of Lincoln College, Radcliffe relinquished a\r\nfellowship, which he could no longer hold, without taking orders, in\r\n1677. He did not take his M. D. degree till 1682, two years after\r\nwhich time he went up to London, and took a house in Bow Street, next\r\nthat in which Sir Godfrey Kneller long resided; and with a facility\r\nwhich can hardly be credited in these days, when success is achieved\r\nonly by slow advances, he stept forthwith into a magnificent income.\r\n\r\nThe days of mealy-mouthed suavity had not yet come to the Faculty.\r\nInstead of standing by each other with lip-service, as they now do in\r\nspite of all their jealousies, physicians and surgeons vented their\r\nmutual enmities in frank, honest abuse. Radcliffe's tongue was well\r\nsuited for this part of his business; and if that unruly member\r\ncreated for him enemies, it could also contend with a legion of\r\nadversaries at the same time. Foulks and Adams, then the first\r\napothecaries in Oxford, tried to discredit the young doctor, but were\r\nere long compelled to sue for a cessation of hostilities. Luff, who\r\nafterwards became Professor of Physic in the University, declared that\r\nall \"Radcliffe's cures were performed only by guesswork\"; and Gibbons,\r\nwith a sneer, said, \"that it was a pity that his friends had not made\r\na scholar of the young man.\" In return Radcliffe always persisted in\r\nspeaking of his opponent as _Nurse_ Gibbons--because of his slops and\r\ndiet drinks, whereas he (Radcliffe the innovator) preached up the good\r\neffects of fresh air, a liberal table, and cordials. This was the Dr.\r\nGibbons around whom the apothecaries rallied, to defend their\r\ninterests in the great Dispensarian contest, and whom Garth in his\r\npoem ridicules, under the name of \"Mirmillo,\" for entertaining\r\ndrug-venders:--\r\n\r\n    \"Not far from that frequented theatre,\r\n    Where wandering punks each night at five repair,\r\n    Where purple emperors in buskins tread,\r\n    And rule imaginary worlds for bread;\r\n    Where Bentley, by old writers, wealthy grew,\r\n    And Briscoe lately was undone by new;\r\n    There triumphs a physician of renown,\r\n    To none, but such as rust in health, unknown.\r\n          .      .      .      .      .\r\n    The trading tribe oft thither throng to dine,\r\n    And want of elbow-room supply in wine.\"\r\n\r\nGibbons was not the only dangerous antagonist that Radcliffe did\r\nbattle with in London. Dr. Whistler, Sir Edmund King, Sir Edward\r\nHannes, and Sir Richard Blackmore were all strong enough to hurt him\r\nand rouse his jealousy. Hannes, also an Oxford man, was to the last a\r\ndangerous and hated rival. He opened his campaign in London with a\r\ncarriage and four horses. The equipage was so costly and imposing that\r\nit attracted the general attention of the town. \"By Jove! Radcliffe,\"\r\nsaid a kind friend, \"Hannes's horses are the finest I have ever seen.\"\r\n\"Umph!\" growled Radcliffe savagely, \"then he'll be able to sell them\r\nfor all the more.\"\r\n\r\nTo make his name known Hannes used to send his liveried footmen\r\nrunning about the streets with directions to put their heads into\r\nevery coach they met and inquire, with accents of alarm, if Dr. Hannes\r\nwas in it. Acting on these orders, one of his fellows, after looking\r\ninto every carriage between Whitehall and the Royal Exchange, without\r\nfinding his employer, ran up Exchange Alley into Garraway's\r\nCoffee-house, which was one of the great places of meeting for the\r\nmembers of the medical profession. (Apothecaries used regularly to\r\ncome and consult the physicians, while the latter were over their\r\nwine, paying only half fees for the advice so given, without the\r\npatients being personally examined. Batson's coffee-house in Corn-hill\r\nwas another favourite spot for these Galenic re-unions, Sir William\r\nBlizard being amongst the last of the medical authorities who\r\nfrequented that hostelry for the purpose of receiving apothecaries.)\r\n\"Gentlemen, can your honours tell me if Dr. Hannes is here?\" asked the\r\nman, running into the very centre of the exchange of medicine-men.\r\n\"Who wants Dr. Hannes, fellow?\" demanded Radcliffe, who happened to be\r\npresent. \"Lord A---- and Lord B----, your honour!\" answered the man.\r\n\"No, no, friend,\" responded the doctor slowly, and with pleasant\r\nirony, \"you are mistaken. Those lords don't want your master--'tis he\r\nwho wants them.\"\r\n\r\nBut Hannes made friends and a fine income, to the deep chagrin of his\r\ncontemptuous opponent. An incessant feud existed between the two men.\r\nThe virulence of their mutual animosity may be estimated by the\r\nfollowing story. When the poor little Duke of Gloucester was taken\r\nill, Sir Edward Hannes and Blackmore (famous as Sir Richard Blackmore,\r\nthe poet) were called in to attend him. On the case taking a fatal\r\nturn, Radcliffe was sent for; and after roundly charging the two\r\ndoctors with the grossest mismanagement of a simple attack of rash,\r\nwent on, \"It would have been happy for this nation had you, sir, been\r\nbred up a basket-maker--and you, sir, had remained a country\r\nschoolmaster, rather than have ventured out of your reach, in the\r\npractice of an art which you are an utter stranger to, and for your\r\nblunders in which you ought to be whipped with one of your own rods.\"\r\nThe reader will not see the force of this delicate speech if he is not\r\naware that Hannes was generally believed to be the son of a\r\nbasket-maker, and Sir Richard Blackmore had, in the period of his\r\nearly poverty, like Johnson and Oliver Goldsmith, been a teacher of\r\nboys. Whenever the \"Amenities of the Faculty\" come to be published,\r\nthis consultation, on the last illness of Jenkin Lewis's little\r\nfriend, ought to have its niche in the collection.\r\n\r\nTowards the conclusion of his life, Radcliffe said that, \"when a young\r\npractitioner, he possessed twenty remedies for every disease; and at\r\nthe close of his career he found twenty diseases for which he had not\r\none remedy.\" His mode of practice, however, as far as anything is\r\nknown about it, at the outset was the same as that which he used at\r\nthe conclusion of his career. Pure air, cleanliness, and a wholesome\r\ndiet were amongst his most important prescriptions; though he was so\r\nfar from running counter to the interests of the druggists, that his\r\napothecary, Dandridge, whose business was almost entirely confined to\r\npreparing the doctor's medicines, died worth 50,000_l_. For the\r\nimaginary maladies of his hypochondriacal male and fanciful female\r\npatients he had the greatest contempt, and neither respect for age or\r\nrank, nor considerations of interest, could always restrain him from\r\ninsulting such patients. In 1686 he was appointed physician to\r\nPrincess Anne of Denmark, and was for some years a trusted adviser of\r\nthat royal lady; but he lacked the compliant temper and imperturbable\r\nsuavity requisite for a court physician. Shortly after the death of\r\nQueen Mary, the Princess Anne, having incurred a fit of what is by the\r\nvulgar termed \"blue devils,\" from not paying proper attention to her\r\ndiet, sent in all haste to her physician. Radcliffe, when he received\r\nthe imperative summons to hurry to St. James's was sitting over his\r\nbottle in a tavern. The allurements of Bacchus were too strong for\r\nhim, and he delayed his visit to the distinguished sufferer. A second\r\nmessenger arrived, but by that time the physician was so gloriously\r\nennobled with claret, that he discarded all petty considerations of\r\npersonal advantage, and flatly refused to stir an inch from the room\r\nwhere he was experiencing all the happiness humanity is capable of.\r\n\"Tell her Royal Highness,\" he exclaimed, banging his fist on the\r\ntable, \"that her distemper is nothing but the vapours. She's in as\r\ngood state of health as any woman breathing--only she can't make up\r\nher mind to believe it.\"\r\n\r\nThe next morning prudence returned with sobriety; and the doctor did\r\nnot fail to present himself at an early hour in the Princess's\r\napartment in St. James's Palace. To his consternation he was stopped\r\nin the ante-room by an officer, and informed that he was dismissed\r\nfrom his post, which had already been given to Dr. Gibbons. Anne never\r\nforgave the sarcasm about \"the vapours.\" It so rankled in her breast,\r\nthat, though she consented to ask for the Doctor's advice both for\r\nherself and those dear to her, she never again held any cordial\r\ncommunication with him. Radcliffe tried to hide the annoyance caused\r\nhim by his fall, in a hurricane of insolence towards his triumphant\r\nrival: Nurse Gibbons had gotten a new nursery--Nurse Gibbons was not\r\nto be envied his new acquisition--Nurse Gibbons was fit only to look\r\nafter a woman who merely fancied herself ill.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this rupture with the Court, Radcliffe continued to\r\nhave the most lucrative practice in town, and in all that regarded\r\nmoney he was from first to last a most lucky man. On coming to town he\r\nfound Lower, the Whig physician, sinking in public favour--and Thomas\r\nShort, the Roman Catholic doctor, about to drop into the grave.\r\nWhistler, Sir Edmund King, and Blackmore had plenty of patients. But\r\nthere was a \"splendid opening,\" and so cleverly did Radcliffe slip\r\ninto it, that at the end of his first year in town he got twenty\r\nguineas per diem. The difference in the value of money being taken\r\ninto consideration, it may be safely affirmed that no living\r\nphysician makes more. Occasionally the fees presented to him were very\r\nlarge. He cured Bentinck, afterwards Earl of Portland, of a\r\ndiarrhœa, and Zulestein, afterwards Earl of Rochford, of an attack\r\nof congestion of the brain. For these services William III. presented\r\nhim with 500 guineas out of the privy-purse, and offered to appoint\r\nhim one of his physicians, with £200 per annum more than he gave any\r\nother of his medical officers. Radcliffe pocketed the fee, but his\r\nJacobite principles precluded him from accepting the post. William,\r\nhowever, notwithstanding the opposition of Bidloe and the rest of his\r\nmedical servants, held Radcliffe in such estimation that he\r\ncontinually consulted him; and during the first eleven years of his\r\nreign paid him, one year with another, 600 guineas per annum. And when\r\nhe restored to health William, Duke of Gloucester (the Princess of\r\nDenmark's son), who in his third year was attacked with severe\r\nconvulsions, Queen Mary sent him, through the hand of her Lord\r\nChamberlain, 1000 guineas. And for attending the Earl of Albemarle at\r\nNamur he had 400 guineas and a diamond ring, 1200 guineas from the\r\ntreasury, and an offer of a baronetcy from the King.\r\n\r\nFor many years he was the neighbour of Sir Godfrey Kneller, in Bow\r\nStreet. A dispute that occurred between the two neighbours and friends\r\nis worth recording. Sir Godfrey took pleasure in his garden, and\r\nexpended large sums of money in stocking it with exotic plants and\r\nrare flowers. Radcliffe also enjoyed a garden, but loved his fees too\r\nwell to expend them on one of his own. He suggested to Sir Godfrey\r\nthat it would be a good plan to insert a door into the boundary wall\r\nbetween their gardens, so that on idle afternoons, when he had no\r\npatients to visit, he might slip into his dear friend's\r\npleasure-grounds. Kneller readily assented to this proposition, and\r\nere a week had elapsed the door was ready for use. The plan, however,\r\nhad not been long acted on when the painter was annoyed by Radcliffe's\r\nservants wantonly injuring his parterres. After fruitlessly\r\nexpostulating against these depredations, the sufferer sent a message\r\nto his friend, threatening, if the annoyance recurred, to brick up the\r\nwall. \"Tell Sir Godfrey,\" answered Radcliffe to the messenger, \"that\r\nhe may do what he likes to the door, so long as he does not paint it.\"\r\nWhen this vulgar jeer was reported to Kneller, he replied, with equal\r\ngood humour and more wit, \"Go back and give my service to Dr.\r\nRadcliffe, and tell him, I'll take anything from him--but physic.\"\r\n\r\nRadcliffe was never married, and professed a degree of misogyny that\r\nwas scarcely in keeping with his conduct on certain occasions. His\r\nperson was handsome and imposing, but his manners were little\r\ncalculated to please women. Overbearing, truculent, and abusive, he\r\ncould not rest without wounding the feelings of his companions with\r\nharsh jokes. Men could bear with him, but ladies were like Queen Anne\r\nin vehemently disliking him. King William was not pleased with his\r\nbrutal candour in exclaiming, at the sight of the dropsical ancles\r\nuncovered for inspection, \"I would not have your Majesty's legs for\r\nyour three kingdoms\"; but William's sister-in-law repaid a much\r\nslighter offence with life-long animosity. In 1693, however, the\r\ndoctor made an offer to a citizen's daughter, who had beauty and a\r\nfortune of £15,000. As she was only twenty-four years of age, the\r\ndoctor was warmly congratulated by his friends when he informed them\r\nthat he, though well advanced in middle age, had succeeded in his\r\nsuit. Before the wedding-day, however, it was discovered that the\r\nhealth of the lady rendered it incumbent on her honour that she should\r\nmarry her father's book-keeper. This mishap soured the doctor's temper\r\nto the fair sex, and his sarcasms at feminine folly and frailty were\r\ninnumerable.\r\n\r\nHe was fond of declaring that he wished for an Act of Parliament\r\nentitling nurses to the sole and entire medical care of women. A lady\r\nwho consulted him about a nervous singing in the head was advised to\r\n\"curl her hair with a ballad.\" His scorn of women was not lessened by\r\nthe advances of certain disorderly ladies of condition, who displayed\r\nfor him that morbid passion which medical practitioners have often to\r\nresist in the treatment of hysterical patients. Yet he tried his luck\r\nonce again at the table of love. \"There's no fool so great as an old\r\nfool.\" In the summer of 1709, Radcliffe, then in his sixtieth year,\r\nstarted a new equipage; and having arrayed himself in the newest mode\r\nof foppery, threw all the town into fits of laughter by paying his\r\naddresses, with the greatest possible publicity, to a lady who\r\npossessed every requisite charm--(youth, beauty, wealth)--except a\r\ntenderness for her aged suitor. Again was there an unlucky termination\r\nto the doctor's love, which Steele, in No. 44 of _The Tatler_,\r\nridiculed in the following manner:--\r\n\r\n\"This day, passing through Covent Garden, I was stopped in the Piazza\r\nby Pacolet, to observe what he called _The Triumph of Love and Youth_.\r\nI turned to the object he pointed at, and there I saw a gay gilt\r\nchariot, drawn by fresh prancing horses, the coachman with a new\r\ncockade, and the lacqueys with insolence and plenty in their\r\ncountenances. I asked immediately, 'What young heir, or lover, owned\r\nthat glittering equipage!' But my companion interrupted, 'Do not you\r\nsee there the mourning Æsculapius?' 'The mourning!' said I. 'Yes,\r\nIsaac,' said Pacolet, 'he is in deep mourning, and is the languishing,\r\nhopeless lover of the divine Hebe, the emblem of Youth and Beauty.\r\nThat excellent and learned sage you behold in that furniture is the\r\nstrongest instance imaginable that love is the most powerful of all\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n\"'You are not so ignorant as to be a stranger to the character of\r\nÆsculapius, as the patron and most successful of all who profess the\r\nArt of Medicine. But as most of his operations are owing to a natural\r\nsagacity or impulse, he has very little troubled himself with the\r\nDoctrine of Drugs, but has always given Nature more room to help\r\nherself than any of her learned assistants; and consequently has done\r\ngreater wonders than in the power of Art to perform; for which reason\r\nhe is half deified by the people, and has ever been courted by all the\r\nworld, just as if he were a seventh son.\r\n\r\n\"'It happened that the charming Hebe was reduc'd, by a long and\r\nviolent fever, to the most extreme danger of Death; and when all skill\r\nfailed, they sent for Æsculapius. The renowned artist was touched with\r\nthe deepest compassion, to see the faded charms and faint bloom of\r\nHebe; and had a generous concern, too, in beholding a struggle, not\r\nbetween Life, but rather between Youth, and Death. All his skill and\r\nhis passion tended to the recovery of Hebe, beautiful even in\r\nsickness; but, alas! the unhappy physician knew not that in all his\r\ncare he was only sharpening darts for his own destruction. In a word,\r\nhis fortune was the same with that of the statuary who fell in love\r\nwith an image of his own making; and the unfortunate Æsculapius is\r\nbecome the patient of her whom he lately recovered. Long before this,\r\nÆsculapius was far gone in the unnecessary and superfluous amusements\r\nof old age, in the increase of unwieldy stores, and the provision in\r\nthe midst of an incapacity of enjoyment, of what he had for a supply\r\nof more wants than he had calls for in Youth itself. But these low\r\nconsiderations are now no more; and Love has taken place of Avarice,\r\nor rather is become an Avarice of another kind, which still urges him\r\nto pursue what he does not want. But behold the metamorphosis: the\r\nanxious mean cares of an usurer are turned into the languishments and\r\ncomplaints of a lover. \"Behold,\" says the aged Æsculapius, \"I submit;\r\nI own, great Love, thy empire. Pity, Hebe, the fop you have made. What\r\nhave I to do with gilding but on Pills? Yet, O Fate! for thee I sit\r\namidst a crowd of painted deities on my chariot, buttoned in gold,\r\nclasp'd in gold, without having any value for that beloved metal, but\r\nas it adorns the person and laces the hat of the dying lover. I ask\r\nnot to live, O Hebe! Give me but gentle death. Euthanasia, Euthanasia!\r\nthat is all I implore.\"' When Æsculapius had finished his complaint,\r\nPacolet went on in deep morals on the uncertainty of riches, with\r\nthis remarkable explanation--'O wealth! how impatient art thou! And\r\nhow little dost thou supply us with real happiness, when the usurer\r\nhimself cannot forget thee, for the love of what is foreign to his\r\nfelicity, as thou art!'\"\r\n\r\nSeven days after the _Tatler_ resumed the attack, but with less happy\r\neffect. In this picture, the justice of which was not questioned, even\r\nby the Doctor's admirers, the avarice of the veteran is not less\r\ninsisted on as the basis of his character, than his amorousness is\r\ndisplayed as a ludicrous freak of vanity. Indeed, love of money was\r\nthe master-defect of Radcliffe's disposition. Without a child, or a\r\nprospect of offspring, he screwed and scraped in every direction. Even\r\nhis debaucheries had an alloy of discomfort that does not customarily\r\nmingle in the dissipations of the rich. The flavour of the money each\r\nbottle cost gave ungrateful smack to his wine. He had numerous poor\r\nrelations, of whom he took, during his life, little or no notice. Even\r\nhis sisters he kept at arm's distance, lest they should show their\r\naffection for him by dipping their hands in his pockets. It is true,\r\nhe provided liberally for them at his death--leaving to the one (a\r\nmarried lady--Mrs. Hannah Redshaw) a thousand a year for life, and to\r\nthe other (a spinster lady) an income of half that amount as long as\r\nshe lived. But that he treated them with unbrotherly neglect there is\r\nno doubt.\r\n\r\nAfter his decease, a letter was found in his closet, directed to his\r\nunmarried sister, Millicent Radcliffe, in which, with contrition, and\r\nmuch pathos, he bids her farewell. \"You will find,\" says he, in that\r\nepistle, \"by my will that I have taken better care of you than\r\nperhaps you might expect from my former treatment of you; for which,\r\nwith my dying breath, I most heartily ask pardon. I had indeed acted\r\nthe brother's part much better, in making a handsome settlement on you\r\nwhile living, than after my decease; and can plead nothing in excuse,\r\nbut that the love of money, which I have emphatically known to be the\r\nroot of all evil, was too predominant over me. Though, I hope, I have\r\nmade some amends for that odious sin of covetousness, in my last\r\ndispositions of those worldly goods which it pleased the great\r\nDispenser of Providence to bless me with.\"\r\n\r\nWhat made this meanness of disposition in money matters the more\r\nremarkable was, that he was capable of occasional munificence, on a\r\nscale almost beyond his wealth, and also of a stoical fortitude under\r\nany reverse of fortune that chanced to deprive him of some of his\r\nbeloved guineas.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1704, at a general collection for propagating the Gospel\r\nin foreign parts, he settled on the Society established for that\r\npurpose £50 per annum for ever. And this noble gift he unostentatiously\r\nmade under an assumed name. In the same year he presented £520 to the\r\nBishop of Norwich, to be distributed among the poor non-juring clergy;\r\nand this donation he also desired should be kept a secret from the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nHis liberality to Oxford was far from being all of the _post-mortem_\r\nsort. In 1687 he presented the chapel of University College with an\r\neast window, representing, in stained glass, the Nativity, and having\r\nthe following inscription:--\"D.D. Johan Radcliffe, M.D., hujus\r\nCollegii quondam Socius, Anno Domini MDCLXXXVII.\" In 1707 he gave\r\nSprat, Bishop of Rochester, bills for £300, drawn under the assumed\r\nname of Francis Andrews, on Waldegrave the goldsmith, of Russell\r\nStreet, Covent Garden, for the relief of distressed Scotch Episcopal\r\nclergy.\r\n\r\nAs another instance of how his niggard nature could allow him to do\r\ngood by stealth, and blush to find it fame, his liberality to James\r\nDrake, the Tory writer, may be mentioned. Drake was a physician, as\r\nwell as a political author. As the latter, he was well liked, as the\r\nformer he was honestly hated by Radcliffe. Two of a trade--where one\r\nof the two is a John Radcliffe--can never agree. Each of the two\r\ndoctors had done his utmost to injure the reputation of the other. But\r\nwhen Drake, broken in circumstances by a political persecution, was in\r\nsore distress from want of money, Radcliffe put fifty guineas into a\r\nlady's hands, and begged her to convey it to Drake. \"Let him,\" said\r\nRadcliffe, with the delicacy of a fine heart, \"by no means be told\r\nwhence it comes. He is a gentleman, and has often done his best to\r\nhurt me. He could, therefore, by no means brook the receipt of a\r\nbenefit from a person whom he had used all possible means to make an\r\nenemy.\"\r\n\r\nAfter such instances of Ratcliffe's generosity, it may seem\r\nunnecessary to give more proofs of the existence of that quality,\r\ndisguised though it was by miserly habits. His friend Nutley, a loose\r\nrollicking gentleman about town, a barrister without practice, a man\r\nof good family, and no fortune, a jovial dog, with a jest always on\r\nhis lips, wine in his head, and a death's-head grinning over each\r\nshoulder [such bachelors may still be found in London], was in this\r\ncase the object of the doctor's benevolence. Driven by duns and\r\ntippling to the borders of distraction, Nutley crept out of his\r\nchambers under the cover of night to the \"Mitre Tavern,\" and called\r\nfor \"a bottle.\" \"A bottle\" with Nutley meant \"many bottles.\" The end\r\nof it was that the high-spirited gentleman fell down in a condition of\r\n---- well! in a condition that Templars, in this age of earnest\r\npurpose and decent morals, would blush to be caught in. Mr. Nutley was\r\ntaken hold of by the waiters, and carried up-stairs to bed.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the merry fellow is in the saddest of all possible\r\nhumours. The memory of a few little bills, the holders of which are\r\nholding a parliament on his stair-case in Pump-court; the recollection\r\nthat he has not a guinea left--either to pacify those creditors with,\r\nor to use in paying for the wine consumed over night; a depressing\r\nsense that the prominent features of civilized existence are\r\ntax-gatherers and sheriff's officers; a head that seems to be falling\r\nover one side of the pillow, whilst the eyes roll out on the\r\nother;--all these afflict poor Mr. Nutley! A knock at the door, and\r\nthe landlady enters. The landlady is the Widow Watts, daughter of the\r\nwidow Bowles, also in the same line. As now, so a hundred and fifty\r\nyears ago, ladies in licensed victualling circles played tricks with\r\ntheir husbands' night-caps--killed them with kindness, and reigned in\r\ntheir stead. The widow Watts has a sneaking fondness for poor Mr.\r\nNutley, and is much affected when, in answer to her inquiry how \"his\r\nhonour feels his-self,\" he begins to sob like a child, narrate the\r\ntroubles of his infancy, the errors of his youth, and the sorrows of\r\nhis riper age. Mistress Watts is alarmed. Only to think of Mr. Nutley\r\ngoing on like that, talking of his blessed mother who had been dead\r\nthese twenty years, and vowing he'd kill himself, because he is an\r\noutcast, and no better than a disgrace to his family. \"To think of it!\r\nand only yesterday he were the top of company, and would have me drink\r\nhis own honourable health in a glass of his own wine.\" Mistress Watts\r\nsends straightway for Squire Nutley's friend, the Doctor. When\r\nRadcliffe makes his appearance, he sees the whole case at a glance,\r\nrallies Billy Nutley about his rascally morals, estimates his\r\nassertion that \"it's only his liver a little out of order\" exactly at\r\nits worth, and takes his leave shortly, saying to himself, \"If poor\r\nBilly could only be freed from the depression caused by his present\r\npecuniary difficulties, he would escape for this once a return of the\r\ndeliri....\" At the end of another half hour, a goldsmith's man enters\r\nthe bed-room, and puts into Nutley's hand a letter and a bag of gold\r\ncontaining 200 guineas. The epistle is from Radcliffe, begging his\r\nfriend to accept the money, and to allow the donor to send him in a\r\nfew days 300 more of the same coins. Such was the physician's\r\nprescription, in dispensing which he condescended to act as his own\r\napothecary. Bravo, doctor!--who of us shall say which of the good\r\ndeeds--thy gift to Billy Nutley or thy princely bequest to Oxford--has\r\nthe better right to be regarded as the offspring of sincere\r\nbenevolence? Some--and let no \"fie!\" be cried upon them--will find in\r\nthis story more to make them love thy memory than they have ever found\r\nin that noble library whose dome stands up amidst the towers, and\r\nsteeples, and sacred walls of beloved Oxford.\r\n\r\nIt would not be hard to say which of the two gifts has done the\r\ngreater good. Poor Will Nutley took his 500 guineas, and had \"more\r\nbottles,\" went a few more times to the theatres in lace and velvet and\r\nbrocade, roared out at a few more drinking bouts, and was carried off\r\nby [his biographer calls it \"a violent fever\"] in the twenty-ninth\r\nyear of his age. And possibly since Willy Nutley was Willy Nutley, and\r\nno one else, this was the best possible termination for him. That\r\nRadcliffe, the head of a grave profession, and a man of fifty-seven\r\nyears of age, should have conceived an enthusiastic friendship for a\r\nyoungster of half his age, is a fact that shows us one of the\r\nconsequences of the tavern life of our great-grandfathers. It puts us\r\nin mind of how Fielding, ere he had a beard, burst into popularity\r\nwith the haunters of coffee-houses. When roistering was in fashion, a\r\nyoung man had many chances which he no longer possesses. After the\r\ntheatres were closed, he reeled into the hostels of the town, singing\r\nsnatches with the blithe, clear voice of youth, laughing and jesting\r\nwith all around, and frequently amongst that \"all\" he came in contact\r\nwith the highest and most powerful men of the time. A boy-adventurer\r\ncould display his wit and quality to statesmen and leaders of all\r\nsorts; whereas now he must wait years before he is even introduced to\r\nthem, and years more ere he gets an invitation to their formal\r\ndinners, at which Barnes Newcome cuts as brilliant a figure as the\r\nbest and the strongest.\r\n\r\nThroughout his life Radcliffe was a staunch and manly Jacobite. He was\r\nfor \"the king\"; but neither loyalty nor interest could bind him to\r\nhigher considerations than those of attachment to the individual he\r\nregarded as the rightful head of the realm. In 1688, when Obadiah\r\nWalker tried to wheedle him into the folly of becoming a Romanist, the\r\nattempt at perversion proved a signal failure. Nothing can be more\r\ntruly manly than his manner of rejecting the wily advances of the\r\nproselytizing pervert. \"The advantages you propose to me,\" he writes,\r\n\"may be very great, for all that I know; God Almighty can do very much\r\nand so can the king; but you'll pardon me if I cease to speak like a\r\nphysician for once, and, with an air of gravity, am very apprehensive\r\nthat I may anger the one in being too complaisant to the other. You\r\ncannot call this pinning my faith to any man's sleeve; those that know\r\nme are too well apprized of my quite contrary tendency. As I never\r\nflattered a man myself, so 'tis my firm resolution never to be\r\nwheedled out of my real sentiments--which are, that since it has been\r\nmy good fortune to be educated according to the usage of the Church of\r\nEngland, established by law, I shall never make myself so unhappy as\r\nto shame my teachers and instructors by departing from what I have\r\nimbibed from them.\"\r\n\r\nThus was Walker treated when he abused his position as head of\r\nUniversity College. But when the foolish man was deprived of his\r\noffice, he found a good friend in him whom he had tried to seduce from\r\nthe Church in which he had been reared. From the time of his first\r\ncoming to London from Oxford, on the abdication of James the Second,\r\nup to the time of his death, Walker subsisted on a handsome allowance\r\nmade to him out of Radcliffe's purse. When, also, the discarded\r\nprincipal died, it was the doctor who gave him an honourable interment\r\nin Pancras churchyard, and years afterwards erected a monument to his\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\nAs years passed on, without the restitution of the proscribed males of\r\nthe Stuart House, Radcliffe's political feelings became more bitter.\r\nHe was too cautious a man to commit himself in any plot having for its\r\nobject a change of dynasty; but his ill-humour at the existing state\r\nof things vented itself in continual sarcasms against the chiefs of\r\nthe Whig party with whom he came in contact. He professed that he did\r\nnot wish for practice amongst the faction to which he was opposed. He\r\nhad rather only preserve the lives of those citizens who were loyal to\r\ntheir king. One of the immediate results of this affectation was\r\nincreased popularity with his political antagonists. Whenever a Whig\r\nleader was dangerously ill, his friends were sure to feel that his\r\nonly chance of safety rested on the ministrations of the Jacobite\r\ndoctor. Radcliffe would be sent for, and after swearing a score of\r\ntimes that nothing should induce him to comply with the summons, would\r\nmake his appearance at the sick-bed, where he would sometimes tell the\r\nsufferer that the devil would have no mercy on those who put\r\nconstitutional governments above the divine right of kings. If the\r\npatient recovered, of course his cure was attributed to the Tory\r\nphysician; and if death was the result, the same cause was pointed\r\nto.\r\n\r\nIt might be fancied that, rather than incur a charge of positively\r\nkilling his political antagonists, Radcliffe would have left them to\r\ntheir fates. But this plan would have served him the reverse of well.\r\nIf he failed to attend a Whig's death-bed to which he had been\r\nsummoned, the death was all the same attributed to him. \"He might,\"\r\nexclaimed the indignant survivors, \"have saved poor Tom if he had\r\nliked; only poor Tom was a Whig, and so he left him to die.\" He was\r\ncharged alike with killing Queen Mary, whom he did attend in her dying\r\nillness--and Queen Anne, whom he didn't.\r\n\r\nThe reader of the Harleian MS. of Burnet's \"History\" is amused with\r\nthe following passage, which does not appear in the printed\r\neditions:--\"I will not enter into another province, nor go out of my\r\nown profession, and so will say no more of the physician's part, but\r\nthat it was universally condemned; so that the Queen's death was\r\nimputed to the unskilfulness and wilfulness of Dr. Radcliffe, an\r\nimpious and vicious man, who hated the Queen much, but virtue and\r\nreligion more. He was a professed Jacobite, and was, by many, thought\r\na very bad physician; but others cried him up to the highest degree\r\nimaginable. He was called for, and it appeared but too evident that\r\nhis opinion was depended on. Other physicians were called when it was\r\ntoo late; all symptoms were bad, yet still the Queen felt herself\r\nwell.\"\r\n\r\nRadcliffe's negative murder of Queen Anne was yet more amusing than\r\nhis positive destruction of Mary. When Queen Anne was almost _in\r\nextremis_, Radcliffe was sent for. The Queen, though she never forgave\r\nhim for his drunken ridicule of her vapours, had an exalted opinion\r\nof his professional talents, and had, more than once, winked at her\r\nladies, consulting him about the health of their royal mistress. Now\r\nthat death was at hand, Lady Masham sent a summons for the doctor; but\r\nhe was at Carshalton, sick of his dying illness, and returned answer\r\nthat it would be impossible for him to leave his country-seat and wait\r\non her Majesty. Such was the absurd and superstitious belief in his\r\nmere presence, that the Queen was popularly pictured as having died\r\nbecause he was not present to see her draw her last breath. Whom he\r\nliked he could kill, and whom he liked could keep alive and well. Even\r\nArbuthnot, a brother physician, was so tinctured with the popular\r\nprejudice, that he could gravely tell Swift of the pleasure Radcliffe\r\nhad \"in preserving my Lord Chief Justice Holt's wife, whom he attended\r\nout of spite to her husband, who wished her dead.\"\r\n\r\nIt makes one smile to read Charles Ford's letter to the sarcastic Dean\r\non the subject of the Queen's last illness. \"She continued ill the\r\nwhole day. In the evening I spoke to Dr Arbuthnot, and he told me that\r\nhe did not think her distemper was desperate. Radcliffe was sent for\r\nto Carshalton about noon, by order of council; but said he had taken\r\nphysic and could not come. _In all probability he had saved her life;\r\nfor I am told the late Lord Gower had been often in the condition with\r\nthe gout in the head, and Radcliffe kept him alive many years after._\"\r\nThe author of Gulliver must have grinned as he read this sentence. It\r\nwas strange stuff to write about \"that puppy Radcliffe\" (as the Dean\r\ncalls the physician in his journal to Stella) to the man who coolly\r\nsent out word to a Dublin mob that he had put off an eclipse to a\r\nmore suitable time. The absurdity of Ford's letter is heightened by\r\nthe fact that it was written before the Queen's death. It is dated\r\nJuly 31, 1714, and concludes with the following postscript:--\"The\r\nQueen is something better, and the council again adjourned till eight\r\nin the morning.\" Surely the accusation, then, of negative\r\nwomanslaughter was preferred somewhat prematurely. The next day,\r\nhowever, the Queen died; and then arose a magnificent hubbub of\r\nindignation against the impious doctor. The poor man himself sinking\r\ninto the grave, was at that country-seat where he had entertained his\r\nmedical friends with so many noisy orgies. But the cries for vengeance\r\nreached him in his retreat. \"Give us back our ten days!\" screamed the\r\nrabble of London round Lord Chesterfield's carriage. \"Give us back our\r\nQueen!\" was the howl directed against Radcliffe. The accused was a\r\nmember of the House of Commons, having been elected M.P. for the town\r\nof Buckingham in the previous year; and positively a member (one of\r\nRadcliffe's intimate personal acquaintances) moved that the physician\r\nshould be summoned to attend in his place and be censured for not\r\nattending her late Majesty. To a friend the doctor wrote from\r\nCarshalton on August 7, 1714:--\"Dear Sir,--I could not have thought so\r\nold an acquaintance, and so good a friend as Sir John always professed\r\nhimself, would have made such a motion against me. God knows my will\r\nto do her Majesty any service has ever got the start of my ability,\r\nand I have nothing that gives me greater anxiety and trouble than the\r\ndeath of that great and glorious Princess. I must do that justice to\r\nthe physicians that attended her in her illness, from a sight of the\r\nmethod that was taken for her preservation, transmitted to me by Dr\r\nMead, as to declare nothing was omitted for her preservation; but the\r\npeople about her (the plagues of Egypt fall upon them!) put it out of\r\nthe power of physick to be of any benefit to her. I know the nature of\r\nattending crowned heads to their last moments too well to be fond of\r\nwaiting upon them, without being sent for by a proper authority. You\r\nhave heard of pardons signed for physicians before a sovereign's\r\ndemise. However, as ill as I was, I would have went to the Queen in a\r\nhorse-litter, had either her Majesty, or those in commission next to\r\nher, commanded me so to do. You may tell Sir John as much, and assure\r\nhim, from me, that his zeal for her Majesty will not excuse his ill\r\nusage of _a friend who has drunk many a hundred bottles with him_, and\r\ncannot, even after this breach of good understanding, that was ever\r\npreserved between us, but have a very good esteem for him.\"\r\n\r\nSo strong was the feeling against the doctor, that a set of maniacs at\r\nlarge formed a plan for his assassination. Fortunately, however, the\r\nplot was made known to him in the following letter:--\r\n\r\n\"Doctor,--Tho' I am no friend of yours, but, on the contrary, one that\r\ncould wish your destruction in a legal way, for not preventing the\r\ndeath of our most excellent Queen, whom you had it in your power to\r\nsave, yet I have such an aversion to the taking away men's lives\r\nunfairly, as to acquaint you that if you go to meet the gentlemen you\r\nhave appointed to dine with at the 'Greyhound,' in Croydon, on\r\nThursday next, you will be most certainly murthered. I am one of the\r\npersons engaged in the conspiracy, with twelve more, who are resolved\r\nto sacrifice you to the _Ghost of her late Majesty, that cries aloud\r\nfor blood_; therefore, neither stir out of doors that day, nor any\r\nother, nor think of exchanging your present abode for your house at\r\nHammersmith, since there and everywhere else we shall be in quest of\r\nyou. I am touched with remorse, and give you this notice; but take\r\ncare of yourself, lest I repent of it, and give proofs of so doing, by\r\nhaving it in my power to destroy you, who am your sworn enemy.--N. G.\"\r\n\r\nThat thirteen men could have been found to meditate such a ridiculous\r\natrocity is so incredible, that one is inclined to suspect a hoax in\r\nthis epistle. Radcliffe, however, did not see the letter in that\r\nlight. Panic-struck, he kept himself a close prisoner to his house and\r\nits precincts, though he was very desirous of paying another visit to\r\nLondon--the monotony of his rural seclusion being broken only by the\r\ncustomary visits of his professional associates who came down to\r\ncomfort and drink with him. The end, however, was fast approaching.\r\nThe maladies under which he suffered were exacerbated by mental\r\ndisquiet; and his powers suddenly failing him, he expired on the 1st\r\nof November, 1714, just three months after the death of the murdered\r\nQueen, of whose vapours he had spoken so disrespectfully.\r\n\r\nHis original biographer (from whose work all his many memoirs have\r\nbeen taken) tells the world that the great physician \"_fell a victim\r\nto the ingratitude of a thankless world, and the fury of the gout_.\"\r\n\r\nRadcliffe was an ignorant man, but shrewd enough to see that in the\r\nthen existing state of medical science the book-learning of the\r\nFaculty could be but of little service to him. He was so notoriously\r\ndeficient in the literature of his profession, that his warmest\r\nadmirers made merry about it. Garth happily observed that for\r\nRadcliffe to leave a library was as if a eunuch should found a\r\nseraglio. Nor was Radcliffe ashamed to admit his lack of lore. Indeed,\r\nhe was proud of it; and on the inquiry being made by Bathurst, the\r\nhead of Trinity College, Oxford, where his study was, he pointed to a\r\nfew vials, a skeleton, and an herbal, and answered, \"This is\r\nRadcliffe's library.\" Mead, who rose into the first favour of the town\r\nas the doctor retired from it, was an excellent scholar; but far from\r\nassuming on that ground a superiority to his senior, made it the means\r\nof paying him a graceful compliment. The first time that Radcliffe\r\ncalled on Mead when in town he found his young friend reading\r\nHippocrates.\r\n\r\n\"Do you read Hippocrates in Greek?\" demanded the visitor.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Mead, timidly fearing his scholarship would offend the\r\ngreat man.\r\n\r\n\"I never read him in my life,\" responded Radcliffe, sullenly.\r\n\r\n\"You, sir,\" was the rejoinder, \"have no occasion--you are Hippocrates\r\nhimself.\"\r\n\r\nA man who could manufacture flattery so promptly and courageously\r\ndeserved to get on. Radcliffe swallowed the fly, and was glad to be\r\nthe prey of the expert angler. Only the day before, Mead had thrown\r\nin his ground-bait. As a promising young man, Radcliffe had asked him\r\nto a dinner-party at Carshalton, with the hospitable resolve of\r\nreducing such a promising young man to a state of intoxication, in the\r\npresence of the assembled elders of his profession. Mead, however, was\r\nnot to be so managed. He had strong nerves, and was careful to drink\r\nas little as he could without attracting attention by his abstinence.\r\nThe consequence was that Mead saw magnate after magnate disappear\r\nunder the table, just as he had before seen magnum after magnum\r\ndisappear above it; and still he retained his self-possession. At last\r\nhe and his host were the only occupants of the banqueting-room left in\r\na non-recumbent position. Radcliffe was delighted with his youthful\r\nacquaintance--loved him almost as well as he had loved Billy Nutley.\r\n\r\n\"Mead,\" cried the enthusiastic veteran to the young man, who anyhow\r\nhad not _fallen_ from his chair, \"you are a _rising_ man. You will\r\nsucceed me.\"\r\n\r\n\"That, sir, is impossible,\" Mead adroitly answered; \"You are Alexander\r\nthe Great, and no one can succeed Radcliffe; to succeed to one of his\r\nkingdoms is the utmost of my ambition.\"\r\n\r\nCharmed with the reply, Radcliffe exclaimed,\r\n\r\n\"By ----, I'll recommend you to my patients.\"\r\n\r\nThe promise was kept; and Mead endeavoured to repay the worldly\r\nadvancement with spiritual council. \"I remember,\" says Kennett (_vide_\r\nLansdowne MSS., Brit. Mus.), \"what Dr Mede has told to several of his\r\nfriends, that he fell much into the favour of Dr Radcliffe a few years\r\nbefore his death, and visited him often at Carshalton, where he\r\nobserved upon occasion that there was no Bible to be found in the\r\nhouse. Dr Mede had a mind to supply that defect, without taking any\r\nnotice of it; and therefore one day carried down with him a very\r\nbeautiful Bible that he had lately bought, which had lain in a closet\r\nof King William for his Majesty's own use, and left it as a curiosity\r\nthat he had picked up by the way. When Dr Mede made the last visit to\r\nhim he found that Dr R. had read in it as far as the middle of the\r\nBook of Exodus, from whence it might be inferred that he had never\r\nbefore read the Scriptures; as I doubt must be inferred of Dr Linacre,\r\nfrom the account given by Sir John Cheke.\"\r\n\r\nThe allusion to \"the kingdom of Alexander the Great\" reminds one of\r\nArbuthnot's letter to Swift, in which the writer concludes his sketch\r\nof the proposed map of diseases for Martinus Scriblerus with--\"Then\r\nthe great diseases are like capital cities, with their symptoms all\r\nlike streets and suburbs, with the roads that lead to other diseases.\r\nIt is thicker set with towns than any Flanders map you ever saw.\r\nRadcliffe is painted at the corner of the map, contending for the\r\nuniversal empire of this world, and the rest of the physicians\r\nopposing his ambitious designs, with a project of a treaty of\r\npartition to settle peace.\"\r\n\r\nAs a practitioner, Radcliffe served the public as well as he did his\r\nown interests. The violent measures of bleeding, and the exhibition of\r\nreducing medicines, which constituted the popular practice even to the\r\npresent generation, he regarded with distrust in some cases and horror\r\nin others. There is a good story told of him, that well illustrates\r\nhis disapproval of a kill-or-cure system, and his hatred of Nurse\r\nGibbons. John Bancroft, the eminent surgeon, who resided in Russell\r\nStreet, Covent Garden, had a son attacked with inflammation of the\r\nlungs. Gibbons was called in, and prescribed the most violent\r\nremedies, or rather the most virulent irritants. The child became\r\nrapidly worse, and Radcliffe was sent for. \"I can do nothing, sir,\"\r\nobserved the doctor, after visiting his patient, \"for the poor little\r\nboy's preservation. He is killed to all intents and purposes. But if\r\nyou have any thoughts of putting a stone over him, I'll help you to an\r\ninscription.\" The offer was accepted, and over the child's grave, in\r\nCovent Garden churchyard, was placed a stone sculptured with a figure\r\nof a child laying one hand on his side, and saying, \"Hic dolor,\" and\r\npointing with the other to a death's head on which was engraved, \"Ibi\r\nmedicus.\" This is about the prettiest professional libel which we can\r\npoint to in all the quarrels of the Faculty.\r\n\r\nThe uses to which the doctor applied his wealth every one knows.\r\nNotwithstanding his occasional acts of munificence, and a loss of\r\n£5000 in an East Indian venture, into which Betterton, the tragedian,\r\nseduced him, his accumulations were very great. In his will, after\r\nliberally providing for the members of his family and his dependents,\r\nhe devoted his acquisitions to the benefit of the University of\r\nOxford. From them have proceeded the Radcliffe Library, the Radcliffe\r\nInfirmary, the Radcliffe Observatory, and the Radcliffe Travelling\r\nFellowships. It is true that nothing has transpired in the history of\r\nthese last-mentioned endowments to justify us in reversing the\r\nsentiment of Johnson, who remarked to Boswell: \"It is wonderful how\r\nlittle good Radcliffe's Travelling Fellowships have done. I know\r\nnothing that has been imported by them.\"\r\n\r\nAfter lying in state at his own residence, and again in the\r\nUniversity, Radcliffe's body was interred, with great pomp, in St.\r\nMary's Church, Oxford. The royal gift of so large an estate (which\r\nduring life he had been unable thoroughly to enjoy) to purchase a\r\nlibrary, the contents of which he at no time could have read, of\r\ncourse provoked much comment. It need not be said that the testator's\r\nmemory was, for the most part, extolled to the skies. He had died\r\nrich--a great virtue in itself. He was dead; and as men like to deal\r\nout censure as long as it can cause pain, and scatter praise when it\r\ncan no longer create happiness, Radcliffe, the physician, the friend\r\nof suffering humanity, the benefactor of ancient and Tory Oxford, was\r\nspoken of in \"most handsome terms.\" One could hardly believe that this\r\ngreat good man, this fervent Christian and sublime patriot, was the\r\nsame man as he whom Steele had ridiculed for servile vanity, and to\r\nbring whom into contempt a play was written, and publicly acted, only\r\nten years before, to the intense delight of the Duchess of\r\nMarlborough, and the applauding maids of honour.\r\n\r\nThe philosophic Mandeville, far from approving the behaviour of the\r\nfickle multitude, retained his old opinion of the doctor, and gave it\r\nto the world in his \"Essay on Charity and Charity Schools.\" \"That a\r\nman,\" writes Mandeville, \"with small skill in physic, and hardly any\r\nlearning, should by vile arts get into practice, and lay up great\r\nwealth, is no mighty wonder; but that he should so deeply work\r\nhimself into the good opinion of the world as to gain the general\r\nesteem of a nation, and establish a reputation beyond all his\r\ncontemporaries, with no other qualities but a perfect knowledge of\r\nmankind, and a capacity of making the most of it, is something\r\nextraordinary.\r\n\r\n\"If a man arrived to such a height of glory should be almost\r\ndistracted with pride--sometime give his attendance on a servant, or\r\nany mean person, for nothing and at the same time neglect a nobleman\r\nthat gives exhorbitant fees--at other times refuse to leave his bottle\r\nfor his business, without any regard to the quality of the persons\r\nthat sent for him, or the danger they are in; if he should be surly\r\nand morose, affect to be an humourist, treat his patients like dogs,\r\nthough people of distinction, and value no man but what would deify\r\nhim, and never call in question the certainty of his oracles; if he\r\nshould insult all the world, affront the first nobility, and extend\r\nhis insolence even to the royal family; if to maintain, as well as to\r\nincrease, the fame of his sufficiency, he should scorn to consult his\r\nbetters, on what emergency soever, look down with contempt on the most\r\ndeserving of his profession, and never confer with any other physician\r\nbut what will pay homage to his genius, creep to his humour, and ever\r\napproach him with all the slavish obsequiousness a court flatterer can\r\ntreat a prince with; if a man in his life-time should discover, on the\r\none hand, such manifest symptoms of superlative pride, and an\r\ninsatiable greediness after wealth at the same time; and, on the\r\nother, no regard to religion or affection to his kindred, no\r\ncompassion to the poor, and hardly any humanity to his fellow-creatures;\r\nif he gave no proofs that he loved his country, had a public spirit,\r\nor was a lover of the arts, of books, or of literature--what must we\r\njudge of his motive, the principle he acted from, when, after his\r\ndeath, we find that he has left a trifle among his relations who stood\r\nin need of it, and an immense treasure to a University that did not\r\nwant it.\r\n\r\n\"Let a man be as charitable as it is possible for him to be, without\r\nforfeiting his reason or good sense, can he think otherwise, but that\r\nthis famous physician did, in the making of his will, as in everything\r\nelse, indulge his darling passion, entertaining his vanity with the\r\nhappiness of the contrivance?\"\r\n\r\nThis severe portrait is just about as true as the likeness of a man,\r\npainted by a conscientious enemy, usually is. Radcliffe was not\r\nendowed with a kindly nature. \"Mead, I love you,\" said he to his\r\nfascinating adulator; \"and I'll tell you a sure secret to make your\r\nfortune--use all mankind ill.\" Radcliffe carried out his rule by\r\nwringing as much as possible from, and returning as little as possible\r\nto, his fellowmen. He could not pay a tradesman's bill without a sense\r\nof keen suffering. Even a poor pavior, who had been employed to do a\r\njob to the stones before the doctor's house in Bloomsbury Square\r\n(whither the physician removed from Bow Street), could not get his\r\nmoney without a contest. \"Why, you rascal!\" cried the debtor, as he\r\nalighted from his chariot, \"do you pretend to be paid for such a piece\r\nof work! Why, you have spoiled my pavement, and then covered it over\r\nwith earth to hide the bad work.\"\r\n\r\n\"Doctor,\" responded the man, dryly, \"mine is not the only bad work the\r\nearth hides.\"\r\n\r\nOf course, the only course to pursue with a creditor who could dun in\r\nthis sarcastic style was to pay, and be rid of him. But the doctor\r\nmade up for his own avarice by being ever ready to condemn it in\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nTyson, the miser, being near his last hour, magnanimously resolved to\r\npay two of his 3,000,000 guineas to Radcliffe, to learn if anything\r\ncould be done for his malady. The miserable old man came up with his\r\nwife from Hackney, and tottered into the consulting-room in Bloomsbury\r\nSquare, with two guineas in his hand--\r\n\r\n\"You may go, sir,\" exclaimed Radcliffe, to the astonished wretch, who\r\ntrusted he was unknown--\"you may go home, and die, and be ----,\r\nwithout a speedy repentance; for both the grave and the devil are\r\nready for Tyson of Hackney, who has grown rich out of the spoils of\r\nthe public and the tears of orphans and widows. You'll be a dead man,\r\nsir, in ten days.\"\r\n\r\nThere are numerous stories extant relative to Radcliffe's practice;\r\nbut nearly all those which bear the stamp of genuineness are unfit for\r\npublication in the present polite age. Such stories as the\r\nhasty-pudding one, re-edited by the pleasant author of \"The\r\nGold-headed Cane,\" can be found by the dozen, but the cumbrous\r\nworkmanship of Mr. Joseph Miller is manifest in them all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE DOCTOR AS A BON-VIVANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What must I do, sir!\" inquired an indolent bon-vivant of Abernethy.\r\n\r\n\"Live on sixpence a day, and earn it, sir,\" was the stern answer.\r\n\r\nGabriel Fallopius, who has given his name to a structure with which\r\nanatomists are familiar, gave the same reproof in a more delicate\r\nmanner. With a smile he replied in the words of Terence,\r\n\r\n\"Otio abundas Antipho,\"--\"Sir, you're as lazy as Hall's dog.\"\r\n\r\nBut, though medical practitioners have dealt in sayings like these, to\r\ndo them bare justice, it must be admitted that their preaching has\r\ngenerally been contradicted by the practice. When medicine remained\r\nvery much in the hands of the ladies, the composition of remedies, and\r\nthe making of dinners, went on in the same apartment. Indeed hunger\r\nand thirst were but two out of a list of diseases that were ministered\r\nto by the attendants round a kitchen table. The same book held the\r\nreceipts for dishes and the recipes for electuaries. In many an old\r\nhall of England the manual still remains from which three centuries\r\nago the lady of the house learned to dress a boar's head or cure a\r\ncold. Most physicians would now disdain to give dietetic instruction\r\nto a patient beyond the most general directions; but there are cases\r\nwhere, even in these days, they stoop to do so, with advantage to\r\nthemselves and their patients.\r\n\r\n\"I have ordered twelve dinners this morning,\" a cheery little doctor\r\nsaid to the writer of these pages, on the white cliffs of a well-known\r\nsea-side town.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed--I did not know that was your business.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it is. A host of rich old invalids come down here to be\r\nmedicinally treated. They can't be happy without good living, and yet\r\nare so ignorant of the science and art of eating, that they don't know\r\nhow to distinguish between a luxurious and pernicious diet, and a\r\nluxurious and wholesome one. They flock to the 'Duke's Hotel,' and I\r\nalways tell the landlord what they are to have. Each dinner costs\r\nthree or four guineas. They'd grudge them, and their consciences would\r\nbe uneasy at spending so much money, if they ordered their dinners\r\nthemselves. But when they regard the fare as medicine recommended by\r\nthe doctor, there is no drawback to their enjoyment of it. Their\r\nconfidence in me is unbounded.\"\r\n\r\nThe bottle and the board were once the doctor's two favourite\r\ncompanions. More than one eminent physician died in testifying his\r\naffection for them. In the days of tippling they were the most\r\npersevering of tavern-haunters. No wonder that some of them were as\r\nfat as Daniel Lambert, and that even more died sudden deaths from\r\napoplexy. The obesity of Dr. Stafford was celebrated in an epitaph:--\r\n\r\n    \"Take heed, O good traveller, and do not tread hard,\r\n    For here lies Dr. Stafford in all this churchyard.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Beddoes was so stout that the Clifton ladies used to call him\r\ntheir \"walking feather-bed.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Flemyng weighed twenty stone and eleven pounds, till he reduced\r\nhis weight by abstinence from the delicacies of the table, and by\r\ntaking a quarter of an ounce of common Castile soap every night.\r\n\r\nDr. Cheyne's weight was thirty-two stone, till he cured himself by\r\npersevering in a temperate diet. Laughing at two unwieldly noblemen\r\nwhose corpulence was the favourite jest of all the wits in the court,\r\nLouis XV. said to one of them, \"I suppose you take little or no\r\nexercise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your Majesty will pardon me,\" replied the bulky duke, \"for I\r\ngenerally walk two or three times round my cousin every morning.\"\r\n\r\nSir Theodore Mayerne, who, though he was the most eminent physician of\r\nhis time, did not disdain to write \"Excellent and Well-Approved\r\nReceipts in Cookery, with the best way of Preserving,\" was killed by\r\ntavern wine. He died, after returning from supper in a Strand hotel;\r\nhis immediate friends attributing his unexpected death to the quality\r\nof the beverage, but others, less charitable, setting it down to the\r\nquantity.\r\n\r\nNot many years ago, about a score surgeons were dining together at a\r\ntavern, when, about five minutes after some very \"particular port\" had\r\nbeen sent round for the first time, they all fell back in their\r\nchairs, afflicted in various degrees with sickness, vertigo, and\r\nspasm. A more pleasant sight for the waiters can hardly be conceived.\r\nOne after one the gentlemen were conveyed to beds or sofas.\r\nUnfortunately for the startling effect which the story would otherwise\r\nhave produced, they none of them expired. The next day they remembered\r\nthat, instead of relishing the \"particular port,\" they had detected a\r\nvery unpleasant smack in it. The black bottles were demanded from the\r\ntrembling landlord, when chemical analysis soon discovered that they\r\nhad been previously used for fly-poison, and had not been properly\r\ncleansed. A fine old crust of such a kind is little to be desired.\r\n\r\nIt would perhaps have been well had old Butler (mentioned elsewhere in\r\nthese volumes) met with a similar mishap, if it had only made him a\r\nless obstinate frequenter of beer-shops. He loved tobacco, deeming it\r\n\r\n            \"A physician\r\n    Good both for sound and sickly;\r\n      'Tis a hot perfume\r\n      That expels cold Rheume,\r\n    And makes it flow down quickly.\"\r\n\r\nIt is on record that he made one of his patients smoke twenty-five\r\npipes at a sitting. But fond though he was of tobacco, he was yet\r\nfonder of beer. He invented a drink called \"Butler's Ale,\" afterwards\r\nsold at the Butler's Head, in Mason's Alley, Basinghall Street.\r\nIndeed, he was a sad old scamp. Nightly he would go to the tavern, and\r\ndrink deeply for hours, till his maid-servant, old Nell, came between\r\nnine and ten o'clock and _fetched_ him home, scolding him all the way\r\nfor being such a sot. But though Butler liked ale and wine for\r\nhimself, he thought highly of water for other people. When he occupied\r\nrooms in the Savoy, looking over the Thames, a gentleman afflicted\r\nwith an ague came to consult him. Butler tipped the wink to his\r\nservants, who flung the sick man, in the twinkling of an eye, slap out\r\nof the window into the river. We are asked to believe that \"the\r\nsurprise absolutely cured\" the patient of his malady.\r\n\r\nThe physicians of Charles the Second's day were jolly fellows. They\r\nmade deep drinking and intrigue part of their profession as well as of\r\ntheir practice. Their books contain arguments in favour of indulgence,\r\nwhich their passions suggested and the taste of the times approved.\r\nTobias Whitaker and John Archer, both physicians in ordinary to the\r\nmerry monarch, were representative men of their class. Whitaker, a\r\nNorfolk man, practised with success at Norwich before coming up to\r\nLondon. He published a discourse upon waters, that proved him very\r\nignorant on the subject; and a treatise on the properties of wine,\r\nthat is a much better testimony to the soundness of his understanding.\r\nPrefixed to his \"Elenchus of opinions on Small-Pox,\" is a portrait\r\nthat represents him as a well-looking fellow. That he was a sincere\r\nand discerning worshipper of Bacchus, is shown by his \"Tree of Humane\r\nLife, or the Bloud of the Grape. Proving the possibilitie of\r\nmaintaining humane life from infancy to extreame old age without any\r\nsicknesse by the use of Wine.\" In this work (sold, by the way, in the\r\nauthor's shop, Pope's Head Alley) we read of wine,--\"This is the\r\nphisick that doth not dull, but sets a true edge upon nature, after\r\noperation leaveth no venomous contact. Sure I am this was ancient\r\nphisick, else what meant Avicenna, Rhasis, and Averroes, to move the\r\nbody twice every month with the same; as it is familiar to Nature, so\r\nthey used it familiarly. As for my own experience, though I have not\r\nlived yet so long as to love excesse, yet have I seene such powerful\r\neffects, both on my selfe and others, as if I could render no other\r\nreason, they were enough to persuade me of its excellencie, seeing\r\nextenuate withered bodies by it caused to be faire, fresh, plumpe, and\r\nfat, old and infirme to be young and sound, when as water or\r\nsmall-beer drinkers looke like apes rather than men.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Archer, the author of \"Every Man his own Doctor,\" and \"Secrets\r\nDisclosed,\" was an advocate of generous diet and enlightened\r\nsensuality. His place of business was \"a chamber in a Sadler's howse\r\nover against the Black Horse nigh Charing-cross,\" where his hours of\r\nattendance for some years were from 11 A. M. to 5 P. M. each day. On\r\nsetting up a house at Knightsbridge, where he resided in great style,\r\nhe shortened the number of hours daily passed in London. In 1684 he\r\nannounced in one of his works--\"For these and other Directions you may\r\nsend to the Author, at his chamber against the _Mews_ by\r\nCharing-cross, who is certainly there from twelve to four, at other\r\ntimes at his house at Knightsbridge, being a mile from Charing-cross,\r\nwhere is good air for cure of consumptions, melancholy, and other\r\ninfirmities.\" He had also a business established in Winchester Street,\r\nnear Gresham College, next door to the _Fleece Tavern_. Indeed,\r\nphysician-in-ordinary to the King though he was, he did not think it\r\nbeneath him to keep a number of apothecaries' shops, and, like\r\nWhitaker, to live by the sale of drugs as well as fees. His cordial\r\ndyet drink was advertised as costing 2_s._ 6_d._ per quart; for a box\r\ncontaining 30 morbus pills, the charge was 5_s._; 40 corroborating\r\npills were to be had for the same sum. Like Dr. Everard, he\r\nrecommended his patients to smoke, saying that \"tobacco smoke purified\r\nthe air from infectious malignancy by its fragrancy, sweetened the\r\nbreath, strengthened the brain and memory, and revived the sight to\r\nadmiration.\" He sold tobacco, of a superior quality to the ordinary\r\narticle of commerce, at 2_s._ and 1_s._ an ounce. \"The order of taking\r\nit is like other tobacco at any time; its virtues may be perceived by\r\ntaking one pipe, after which you will spit more, and your mouth will\r\nbe dryer than after common tobacco, which you may moisten by drinking\r\nany warm drink, as coffee, &c., or with sugar candy, liquorish, or a\r\nraisin, and you will find yourself much refreshed.\"\r\n\r\nWhilst Whitaker and Archer were advising men to smoke and drink,\r\nanother physician of the Court was inventing a stomach-brush, in some\r\nrespects much like the bottle-brush with which fly-poison ought to be\r\ntaken from the interior of black bottles before wine is committed to\r\nthem. This instrument was pushed down the gullet, and then poked about\r\nand turned round, much in the same way as a chimney-sweeper's brush is\r\nhandled by a dexterous operator on soot. It was recommended that\r\ngentlemen should thus sweep out their insides not oftener than once a\r\nweek, but not less frequently than once a month. The curious may find\r\nnot only a detailed description but engraved likeness of this\r\nremarkable stomach-brush in the _Gentleman's Magazine_, vol. xx., for\r\nthe year 1750.\r\n\r\nIt would be unfair to take leave of Dr. Archer without mentioning his\r\nthree inventions, on which he justly prided himself not a little. He\r\nconstructed a hot steam-bath, an oven \"which doth with a small faggot\r\nbake a good quantity of anything,\" and \"a compleat charriot that shall\r\nwith any ordinary horse run swift with four or five people within, and\r\nthere is place for more without, all which one horse can as easily\r\ndraw as two horses.\" In these days of vapour baths, bachelors'\r\nkettles, and broughams, surely Dr. Archer ought to have a statue by\r\nthe side of Jenner in Trafalgar Square.\r\n\r\nThe doctors of Anne's time were of even looser morals than their\r\nimmediate predecessors. In taverns, over wine, they received patients\r\nand apothecaries. It became fashionable (a fashion that has lasted\r\ndown to the present day) for a physician to scratch down his\r\nprescriptions illegibly; the mode, in all probability, arising from\r\nthe fact that a doctor's hand was usually too unsteady to write\r\ndistinctly.\r\n\r\nFreind continually visited his patients in a state of intoxication. To\r\none lady of high rank he came in such a state of confusion that when\r\nin her room he could only grumble to himself, \"Drunk--drunk--drunk, by\r\nGod!\" Fortunately the fair patient was suffering from the same malady\r\nas her doctor, who (as she learnt from her maid on returning to\r\nconsciousness) had made the above bluff comment on _her_ case, and\r\nthen had gone away. The next day, Freind was sitting in a penitent\r\nstate over his tea, debating what apology he should offer to his\r\naristocratic patient, when he was relieved from his perplexity by the\r\narrival of a note from the lady herself enclosing a handsome fee,\r\nimploring her dear Dr. Freind to keep her secret, and begging him to\r\nvisit her during the course of the day.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion Freind wrote a prescription for a member of an\r\nimportant family, when his faculties were so evidently beyond his\r\ncontrol that Mead was sent for. On arriving, Mead, with a\r\ncharacteristic delicacy towards his professional friend, took up the\r\ntipsy man's prescription, and having looked at it, said, \"'Pon my\r\nhonour, Dr. Freind can write a better prescription when drunk than I\r\ncan when sober.\"\r\n\r\nGibbons--the \"Nurse Gibbons\" of our old friend Radcliffe--was a deep\r\ndrinker, disgusting, by the grossness of his debaucheries, the polite\r\nand epicurean Garth. But Gibbons did something for English\r\ndinner-tables worth remembering. He brought into domestic use the\r\nmahogany with which we have so many pleasant associations. His\r\nbrother, a West Indian Captain, brought over some of the wood as\r\nballast, thinking it might possibly turn to use. At first the\r\ncarpenters, in a truly conservative spirit, refused to have anything\r\nto do with the \"new wood,\" saying it was too hard for their tools. Dr.\r\nGibbons, however, had first a candle-box and then a bureau made for\r\nMrs. Gibbons out of the condemned material. The bureau so pleased his\r\nfriends, amongst whom was the Duchess of Buckingham, that her Grace\r\nordered a similar piece of furniture, and introduced the wood into\r\nhigh life, where it quickly became the fashion.\r\n\r\nOf Radcliffe's drunkenness mention is made elsewhere. As an eater, he\r\nwas a _gourmand_, not a _gourmet_. When Prince Eugene of Savoy came\r\nover to England on a diplomatic mission, his nephew, the Chevalier de\r\nSoissons, fell into the fashion of the town, roaming it at night in\r\nsearch of frays--a roaring, swaggering mohock. The sprightly\r\nChevalier took it into his head that it would be a pleasant thing to\r\nthrash a watchman; so he squared up to one, and threatened to kill\r\nhim. Instead of succumbing, the watchman returned his assailant's\r\nblows, and gave him an awful thrashing. The next day, what with the\r\nmauling he had undergone, and what with _delirium tremens_, the merry\r\nroisterer was declared by his physician, Sieur Swartenburgh, to be in\r\na dying state. Radcliffe was called in, and acting on his almost\r\ninvariable rule, told Prince Eugene that the young man must die,\r\n_because_ Swartenburgh had maltreated him. The prophecy was true, if\r\nthe criticism was not. The Chevalier died, and was buried amongst the\r\nOrmond family in Westminster Abbey--it being given out to the public\r\nthat he had died of small-pox.\r\n\r\nPrince Eugene conceived a strong liking for Radcliffe, and dined with\r\nhim at the Doctor's residence. The dinner Radcliffe put before his\r\nguest is expressive of the coarseness both of the times and the man.\r\nOn the table the only viands were barons of beef, jiggets of mutton,\r\nlegs of pork, and such other ponderous masses of butcher's stuff,\r\nwhich no one can look at without discomfort, when the first edge has\r\nbeen taken off the appetite. Prince Eugene expressed himself delighted\r\nwith \"the food and liquors!\"\r\n\r\nGeorge Fordyce, like Radcliffe, was fond of substantial fare. For more\r\nthan twenty years he dined daily at Dolly's Chop-house. The dinner he\r\nthere consumed was his only meal during the four-and-twenty hours, but\r\nits bulk would have kept a boa-constrictor happy for a twelvemonth.\r\nFour o'clock was the hour at which the repast commenced, when,\r\npunctual to a minute, the Doctor seated himself at a table specially\r\nreserved for him, and adorned with a silver tankard of strong ale, a\r\nbottle of port-wine, and a measure containing a quarter of a pint of\r\nbrandy. Before the dinner was first put on, he had one light dish of a\r\nbroiled fowl, or a few whitings. Having leisurely devoured this plate,\r\nthe doctor took one glass of brandy, and asked for his steak. The\r\nsteak was always a prime one, weighing one pound and a half. When the\r\nman of science had eaten the whole of it, he took the rest of his\r\nbrandy, then drank his tankard of heady ale, and, lastly, sipped down\r\nhis bottle of port. Having brought his intellects, up or down, to the\r\nstandard of his pupils, he rose and walked down to his house in Essex\r\nStreet to give his six o'clock lecture on Chemistry.\r\n\r\nDr. Beauford was another of the eighteenth-century physicians who\r\nthought temperance a vice that hadn't even the recommendation of\r\ntransient pleasure. A Jacobite of the most enthusiastic sort, he was\r\nnot less than Freind a favourite with the aristocracy who countenanced\r\nthe Stuart faction. As he was known to be very intimate with Lord\r\nBarrymore, the Doctor was summoned, in 1745, to appear before the\r\nPrivy-Council, and answer the questions of the custodians of his\r\nMajesty's safety and honour.\r\n\r\n\"You know Lord Barrymore?\" said one of the Lords of Council.\r\n\r\n\"Intimately--most intimately,\"--was the answer.\r\n\r\n\"You are continually with him?\"\r\n\r\n\"We dine together almost daily when his Lordship is in town.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you talk about?\"\r\n\r\n\"Eating and drinking.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what else?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my lord, we never talk of anything except eating and\r\ndrinking--drinking and eating.\"\r\n\r\nA good deal of treasonable sentiment might have been exchanged in\r\nthese discussions of eating and drinking. \"God send this _crum-well\r\ndown_!\" was the ordinary toast of the Cavalier during the glorious\r\nProtectorate of Oliver. And long afterwards, English gentlemen of\r\nJacobite sympathies, drinking \"to the King,\" before they raised the\r\nglass to their lips, put it over the water-bottle, to indicate where\r\nthe King was whose prosperity they pledged.\r\n\r\nAt the tavern in Finch Lane, where Beauford received the apothecaries\r\nwho followed him, he drank freely, but never was known to give a glass\r\nfrom his bottle to one of his clients. In this respect he resembled\r\nDr. Gaskin of Plymouth, a physician in fine practice in Devonshire at\r\nthe close of the last century, who once said to a young beginner in\r\nhis profession, \"Young man, when you get a fee, don't give fifteen\r\nshillings of it back to your patient in beef and port-wine.\"\r\n\r\nContemporary with Beauford was Dr. Barrowby--wit, scholar, political\r\npartisan, and toper. Barrowby was the hero of an oft-told tale,\r\nrecently attributed in the newspapers to Abernethy. When canvassing\r\nfor a place on the staff of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, Barrowby\r\nentered the shop of one of the governors, a grocer on Snow-hill, to\r\nsolicit his influence and vote. The tradesman, bursting with\r\nimportance, and anticipating the pleasure of getting a very low bow\r\nfrom a gentleman, strutted up the shop, and, with a mixture of\r\ninsolent patronage and insulting familiarity, cried, \"Well, friend,\r\nand what is your business?\"\r\n\r\nBarrowby paused for a minute, cut him right through with the glance of\r\nhis eye, and then said, quietly and slowly, \"I want a pound of plums.\"\r\n\r\nConfused and blushing, the grocer did up the plums. Barrowby put them\r\nin his pocket, and went away without asking the fellow for his vote.\r\n\r\nA good political story is told of Barrowby, the incident of which\r\noccurred in 1749, eleven years after his translation of Astruc's\r\n\"Treatise\" appeared. Lord Trentham (afterwards Lord Gower) and Sir\r\nGeorge Vandeput were contesting the election for Westminster.\r\nBarrowby, a vehement supporter of the latter, was then in attendance\r\non the notorious Joe Weatherby, master of the \"Ben Jonson's Head,\" in\r\nRussell Street, who lay in a perilous state, emaciated by nervous\r\nfever. Mrs. Weatherby was deeply afflicted at her husband's condition,\r\nbecause it rendered him unable to vote for Lord Trentham. Towards the\r\nclose of the polling days the Doctor, calling one day on his patient,\r\nto his great astonishment found him up, and almost dressed by the\r\nnurse and her assistants.\r\n\r\n\"Hey-day! what's the cause of this?\" exclaims Barrowby. \"Why are you\r\nup without my leave?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear Doctor,\" says Joe, in a broken voice, \"I am going to poll.\"\r\n\r\n\"To poll!\" roars Barrowby, supposing the man to hold his wife's\r\npolitical opinions, \"you mean going to the devil! Get to bed, man, the\r\ncold air will kill you. If you don't get into bed instantly you'll be\r\ndead before the day is out.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll do as you bid me, doctor,\" was the reluctant answer. \"But as my\r\nwife was away for the morning, I thought I could get as far as Covent\r\nGarden Church, and vote for Sir George Vandeput.\"\r\n\r\n\"How, Joe, for Sir George?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, sir, I don't go with my wife. I am a Sir George's man.\"\r\n\r\nBarrowby was struck by a sudden change for the better in the man's\r\nappearance, and said, \"Wait a minute, nurse. Don't pull off his\r\nstockings. Let me feel his pulse. Humph--a good firm stroke! You took\r\nthe pills I ordered you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, but they made me feel very ill.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, so much the better; that's what I wished. Nurse, how did he\r\nsleep?\"\r\n\r\n\"Charmingly, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Joe,\" said Barrowby, after a few seconds' consideration, \"if\r\nyou are bent on going to this election, your mind ought to be set at\r\nrest. It's a fine sunny day, and a ride will very likely do you good.\r\nSo, bedad, I'll take you with me in my chariot.\"\r\n\r\nDelighted with his doctor's urbanity, Weatherby was taken off in the\r\ncarriage to Covent Garden, recorded his vote for Sir George Vandeput,\r\nwas brought back in the same vehicle, and died _two_ hours afterwards,\r\namidst the reproaches of his wife and her friends of the Court party.\r\n\r\nCharles the Second was so impressed with the power of the Medical\r\nFaculty in influencing the various intrigues of political parties,\r\nthat he averred that Dr. Lower, Nell Gwynn's physician, did more\r\nmischief than a troop of horse. But Barrowby was prevented, by the\r\nintrusion of death, from rendering effectual service to his party.\r\nCalled away from a dinner-table, where he was drinking deeply and\r\nlaughing much, to see a patient, he got into his carriage, and was\r\ndriven off. When the footman opened the door, on arriving at the house\r\nof sickness, he found his master dead. A fit of apoplexy had struck\r\nhim down, whilst he was still a young man, and just as he was\r\nascending to the highest rank of his profession.\r\n\r\nJohn Sheldon was somewhat addicted to the pleasures of the table. On\r\none occasion, however, he had to make a journey fasting. The son of a\r\nJohn Sheldon, an apothecary who carried on business in the Tottenham\r\nCourt Road, a few doors from the Black Horse Yard, Sheldon conceived\r\nin early life a strong love for mechanics. At Harrow he was birched\r\nfor making a boat and floating it. In after life he had a notable\r\nscheme for taking whales with poisoned harpoons; and, to test its\r\nmerit, actually made a voyage to Greenland. He was moreover the first\r\nEnglishman to make an ascent in a balloon. He went with Blanchard, and\r\nhad taken his place in the car, when the aeronaut, seeing that his\r\nmachine was too heavily weighted, begged him to get out.\r\n\r\n\"If you are my friend, you will alight. My fame, my all, depends on\r\nsuccess,\" exclaimed Blanchard.\r\n\r\n\"I won't,\" bluntly answered Sheldon, as the balloon manifested\r\nsymptoms of rising.\r\n\r\nIn a furious passion, the little air-traveller exclaimed, \"Then I\r\nstarve you! Point du chicken, by Gar, you shall have no chicken.\" So\r\nsaying, he flung the hamper of provisions out of the car, and, thus\r\nlightened, the balloon went up.\r\n\r\nAbernethy is said to have reproved an over-fed alderman for his\r\nexcesses at table in the following manner. The civic footman was\r\nordered to put a large bowl under the sideboard, and of whatever he\r\nserved his master with to throw the same quantity into the bowl as he\r\nput on the gourmand's plate. After the repast was at an end, the sated\r\nfeaster was requested to look into the bowl at a nauseous mess of mock\r\nturtle, turbot, roast-beef, turkey, sausages, cakes, wines, ale,\r\nfruits, cheese.\r\n\r\nSir Richard Jebb showed little favour to the digestion thinking it was\r\nmade to be used--not nursed. Habitually more rough and harsh than\r\nAbernethy in his most surly moods, Jebb offended many of his patients.\r\n\"That's _my_ way,\" said he to a noble invalid, astonished at his\r\nrudeness. \"Then,\" answered the sick man, pointing to the door, \"I beg\r\nyou'll make that your way.\"\r\n\r\nTo all questions about diet Jebb would respond tetchily or carelessly.\r\n\r\n\"Pray, Sir Richard, may I eat a muffin?\" asked a lady.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, madam, 'tis the _best_ thing you can take.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, dear! Sir Richard, I am glad of that. The other day you said it\r\nwas the worst thing in the world for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good, madam, I said so last Tuesday. This isn't a Tuesday--is it?\"\r\n\r\nTo another lady who asked what she might eat he said contemptuously,\r\n\"Boiled turnips.\"\r\n\r\n\"Boiled turnips!\" was the answer; \"you forget, Sir Richard--I told you\r\nI could not bear boiled turnips.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, madam,\" answered Sir Richard, sternly, as if his sense of the\r\nmoral fitness of things was offended, \"you must have a d----d vitiated\r\nappetite.\"\r\n\r\nSir Richard's best set of dietetic directions consisted of the\r\nfollowing negative advice, given to an old gentleman who put the\r\neverlasting question, \"What may I eat?\" \"My directions, sir, are\r\nsimple. You must not eat the poker, shovel, or tongs, for they are\r\nhard of digestion; nor the bellows; but anything else you please.\"\r\n\r\nEven to the King, Sir Richard was plain-spoken. George the Third\r\nlamented to him the restless spirit of his cousin, Dr. John Jebb, the\r\ndissenting minister. \"And please your Majesty,\" was the answer, \"if my\r\ncousin were in heaven he would be a reformer.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Babington used to tell a story of an Irish gentleman, for whom he\r\nprescribed an emetic, saying, \"My dear doctor, it is of no use your\r\ngiving me an emetic. I tried it twice in Dublin, and it would not stay\r\non my stomach either time.\" Jebb's stomach would have gone on\r\ntranquilly, even when entertaining an emetic.\r\n\r\nJebb, with all his bluntness, was a mean lover of the atmosphere of\r\nthe Court. His income was subject to great fluctuations, as the whims\r\nof his fashionable employers ran for or against him. Sir Edward\r\nWilmont's receipts sank from £3000 to £300, in consequence of his\r\nhaving lost two ladies of quality at the Court. Jebb's revenue never\r\nvaried so much as this, but the £15,000 (the greatest sum he ever made\r\nin one year) often fell off by thousands. This fact didn't tend to\r\nlessen his mortification at the loss of a great patient. When George\r\nthe Third dismissed him, and took Sir George Baker in his place, he\r\nnearly died of chagrin. And when he was recalled to attend the royal\r\nfamily in the measles, he nearly died of delight. This ruling passion\r\nexhibited itself strongly in death. When he was on his death-bed, the\r\nQueen, by the hand of a German lady, wrote to inquire after his\r\ncondition. So elated was the poor man with this act of royal\r\nbenignity, that he grasped the letter, and never let go his hold of it\r\ntill the breath of life quitted his attenuated body.\r\n\r\nThis chapter has been for the most part on the feasting of physicians.\r\nWe'll conclude it with a few words on their fasts. In the house of a\r\nStrand grocer there used to be a scientific club, of which the\r\nprincipal members were--W. Heberden, M.D., J. Turton, M.D., G. Baker,\r\nM.D., Sir John Pringle, Sir William Watson, and Lord C. Cavendish who\r\nofficiated as president. Each member paid sixpence per evening for the\r\nuse of the grocer's dining-room. The club took in one newspaper, and\r\nthe only refreshment allowed to be taken at the place of meeting\r\nwas--water.\r\n\r\nThe most abstemious of eminent physicians was Sir Hans Sloane, the\r\npresident of the Royal Society and of the College of Physicians, and\r\n(in a certain sense) the founder of the British Museum. A love of\r\nmoney made him a hater of all good things, except money and his\r\nmuseum. He gave up his winter soirées in Bloomsbury Square, in order\r\nto save his tea and bread and butter. At one of these scientific\r\nentertainments Handel offended the scientific knight deeply by laying\r\na muffin on one of his books. \"To be sure it was a gareless trick,\"\r\nsaid the composer, when telling the story, \"bud it tid no monsdrous\r\nmischief; pode it but the old poog-vorm treadfully oud of sorts. I\r\noffered my best apologies, but the old miser would not have done with\r\nit. If it had been a biscuit, it would not have mattered; but muffin\r\nand pudder. And I said, _Ah, mine Gotd, that is the rub!--it is the\r\npudder!_ Now, mine worthy friend, Sir Hans Sloane, you have a nodable\r\nexcuse, you may save your doast and pudder, and lay it to that\r\nunfeeling gormandizing German; and den I knows it will add something\r\nto your life by sparing your _burse_.\"\r\n\r\nThe eccentric Dr. Glyn of Cambridge, rarely dined, but used to satisfy\r\nhis hunger at chance times by cutting slices off a cold joint (a\r\nconstant ornament of the side-table in his study), and eating them\r\nwhile standing. To eat such a dinner in such an attitude would be to\r\nfare little better than the ascetic physician who used twice a week to\r\ndine off two Abernethy biscuits, consumed as he walked at the pace of\r\nfour miles an hour. However wholesome they may be, the hard biscuits,\r\nknown as Abernethies (but in the construction of which, by-the-by,\r\nAbernethy was no more concerned than were Wellington and Blucher in\r\nmaking the boots that bear their names), are not convivial cates,\r\nthough one would rather have to consume them than the calomel\r\nsandwiches which Dr. Curry (popularly called Dr. Calomel Curry) used\r\nto give his patients.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nFEES.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest times the Leech (Leighis), or healer, has found, in\r\nthe exercise of his art, not only a pleasant sense of being a public\r\nbenefactor, but also the means of private advancement. The use the\r\nchurchmen made of their medical position throughout Christendom (both\r\nbefore and after that decree of the council of Tours, A.D. 1163, which\r\nforbade priests and deacons to perform surgical operations in which\r\ncauteries and incisions were employed), is attested by the broad acres\r\nthey extracted, for their religious corporations, as much from the\r\ngratitude as from the superstition of their patients. And since the\r\nReformation, from which period the vocations of the spiritual and the\r\nbodily physician have been almost entirely kept apart, the\r\npractitioners of medicine have had cause to bless the powers of\r\nsickness. A good story is told of Arbuthnot. When he was a young man\r\n(ere he had won the patronage of Queen Anne, and the friendship of\r\nSwift and Pope), he settled at Dorchester, and endeavoured to get\r\npractice in that salubrious town. Nature obviated his good intentions:\r\nhe wished to minister to the afflicted, if they were rich enough to\r\npay for his ministrations, but the place was so healthy that it\r\ncontained scarce half-a-dozen sick inhabitants. Arbuthnot determined\r\nto quit a field so ill-adapted for a display of his philanthropy.\r\n\"Where are you off to?\" cried a friend, who met him riding post\r\ntowards London. \"To leave your confounded place,\" was the answer, \"for\r\na man can neither live nor die there.\" But to arrive at wealth was not\r\namongst Arbuthnot's faculties; he was unable to use his profession as\r\na trade; and only a few weeks before his death he wrote, \"I am as well\r\nas a man can be who is gasping for breath, and has a house full of men\r\nand women unprovided for.\"\r\n\r\nArbuthnot's ill-luck, however, was quite out of the ordinary rule.\r\nFuller says (1662), \"Physic hath promoted many more, and that since\r\nthe reign of King Henry VIII. Indeed, before his time, I find a doctor\r\nof physic, father to Reginald, first and last Lord Bray. But this\r\nfaculty hath flourished much the three last fifty years; it being true\r\nof physic, what is said of Sylla, 'suos divitiis explevit.' Sir\r\nWilliam Butts, physician to King Henry VIII., Doctor Thomas Wendy, and\r\nDoctor Hatcher, Queen Elizabeth's physician, raised worshipful\r\nfamilies in Norfolk, Cambridge, and Lincolnshire, having borne the\r\noffice of Sheriff in this county.\" Sir William Butts was rewarded for\r\nhis professional services by Henry VIII. with the honour of\r\nKnighthood, and he attended that sovereign when the royal confirmation\r\nwas given, in 1512, to the charter of the barber-surgeons of London.\r\nAnother eminent physician of the same period, who also arrived at the\r\ndignity of knighthood, was John Ayliffe, a sheriff of London, and\r\nmerchant of Blackwell-Hall. His epitaph records:--\r\n\r\n    \"In surgery brought up in youth,\r\n      A knight here lieth dead;\r\n    A knight and eke a surgeon, such\r\n      As England seld' hath bred.\r\n\r\n    \"For which so sovereign gift of God,\r\n      Wherein he did excell,\r\n    King Henry VIII. called him to court,\r\n      Who loved him dearly well.\r\n\r\n    \"King Edward, for his service sake,\r\n      Bade him rise up a knight;\r\n    A name of praise, and ever since\r\n      He Sir John Ayliffe hight.\"\r\n\r\nThis mode of rewarding medical services was not unfrequent in those\r\ndays, and long before. Ignorance as to the true position of the barber\r\nin the middle ages has induced the popular and erroneous belief that\r\nthe barber-surgeon had in olden times a contemptible social status.\r\nUnquestionably his art has been elevated during late generations to a\r\ndignity it did not possess in feudal life; but it might be argued with\r\nmuch force, that the reverse has been the case with regard to his\r\nrank. Surgery and medicine were arts that nobles were proud to\r\npractise for honour, and not unfrequently for emolument. The reigns of\r\nElizabeth and her three predecessors in sovereign power abounded in\r\nmedical and surgical amateurs. Amongst the fashionable empirics\r\nBulleyn mentions Sir Thomas Elliot, Sir Philip Paris, Sir William\r\nGasgoyne, Lady Taylor and Lady Darrel, and especially that \"goodly\r\nhurtlesse Gentleman, Sir Andrew Haveningham, who learned water to kill\r\na canker of his own mother.\" Even an Earl of Derby, about this time,\r\nwas celebrated for his skill in _chirurgerie_ and _bone-setting_, as\r\nalso was the Earl of Herfurth. The Scots nobility were enthusiastic\r\ndabblers in such matters; and we have the evidence of Buchanan and\r\nLindsay as to James IV. of Scotland, \"quod vulnera scientissime\r\ntractaret,\" to use the former authority's words, and in the language\r\nof the latter, that he was \"such a _cunning chirurgeon_, that none in\r\nhis realm who used that craft but would take his counsel in all their\r\nproceedings.\" The only art which fashionable people now-a-days care\r\nmuch to meddle with is literature. In estimating the difference\r\nbetween the position of an eminent surgeon now, and that which he\r\nwould have occupied in earlier times, we must remember that life and\r\nhereditary knighthood are the highest dignities to which he is now\r\npermitted to aspire; although since this honour was first accorded to\r\nhim it has so fallen in public estimation, that it has almost ceased\r\nto be an honour at all. It can scarcely be questioned that if Sir\r\nBenjamin Brodie were to be elevated to the rank of a Baron of the\r\nrealm, he would still not occupy a better position, in regard to the\r\nrest of society, than that which Sir William Butts and Sir John\r\nAyliffe did after they were knighted. A fact that definitely fixes the\r\nhigh esteem in which Edward III. held his medical officers, is one of\r\nhis grants--\"Quod Willielmus Holme Sirurgicus Regis pro vitâ suâ\r\npossit, fugare, capere, et asportare omnimodas feras in quibuscunque\r\nforestis, chaccis parcis et warrennis regis.\" Indeed, at a time when\r\nthe highest dignitaries of the Church, the proudest bishops and the\r\nwealthiest abbots, practised as physicians, it followed, as a matter\r\nof course, that everything pertaining to their profession was\r\nrespected.\r\n\r\nFrom remote antiquity the fee of the healer has been regarded as a\r\nvoluntary offering for services gratuitously rendered. The pretender\r\nto the art always stuck out for a price, and in some form or other\r\nmade the demand which was imprinted on the pillboxes of Lilly's\r\nsuccessor, John Case,\r\n\r\n    \"Here's fourteen pills for thirteen pence,\r\n    Enough in any man's own con-sci-ence.\"\r\n\r\nBut the true physician always left his reward to be measured by the\r\ngratitude and justice of the benefited. He extorted nothing, but\r\nfreely received that which was freely given. Dr. Doran, with his\r\ncharacteristic erudition, says, \"Now there is a religious reason why\r\nfees are supposed not to be taken by physicians. Amongst the Christian\r\nmartyrs are reckoned the two eastern brothers, Damian and Cosmas. They\r\npractised as physicians in Cilicia, and they were the first mortal\r\npractitioners who refused to take recompense for their work. Hence\r\nthey were called Anargyri, or 'without money.' All physicians are\r\npleasantly supposed to follow this example. They never take fees, like\r\nDamian and Cosmas; but they meekly receive what they know will be\r\ngiven out of Christian humility, and with a certain or uncertain\r\nreluctance, which is the nearest approach that can be made in these\r\ntimes to the two brothers who were in partnership at Egea in Cilicia.\"\r\n\r\nBut, with all due respect to our learned writer, there is a much\r\nbetter reason for the phenomenon. Self-interest, and not a Christian\r\nambition to resemble the charitable Cilician brothers, was the cause\r\nof physicians preferring a system of gratuities to a system of legal\r\nrights. They could scarcely have put in _a claim_ without defining the\r\n_amount claimed_; and they soon discovered that a rich patient, left\r\nto his generosity, folly, and impotent anxiety to propitiate the\r\nmysterious functionary who presided over his life, would, in a great\r\nmajority of cases, give ten, or even a hundred times as much as they\r\nin the wildest audacity of avarice would ever dare to ask for.\r\n\r\nSeleucus, for having his son Antiochus restored to health, was fool\r\nenough to give sixty thousand crowns to Erasistratus: and for their\r\nattendance on the Emperor Augustus, and his two next successors, no\r\nless than four physicians received annual pensions of two hundred and\r\nfifty thousand sesterces apiece. Indeed, there is no saying what a\r\nsick man will not give his doctor. The \"cacoethes donandi\" is a\r\nmanifestation of enfeebled powers which a high-minded physician is\r\noften called upon to resist, and an unprincipled one often basely\r\nturns to his advantage. Alluding to this feature of the sick, a\r\ndeservedly successful and honourable practitioner, using the language\r\nof one of our Oriental pro-consuls, said with a laugh to the writer of\r\nthese pages, \"I wonder at my moderation.\"\r\n\r\nBut directly health approaches, this desirable frame of mind\r\ndisappears. When the devil was sick he was a very different character\r\nfrom what he was on getting well. 'Tis so with ordinary patients, not\r\nless than satanic ones. The man who, when he is in his agonies, gives\r\nhis medical attendant double fees three times a day (and vows, please\r\nGod he recover, to make his fortune by trumpeting his praises to the\r\nworld), on becoming convalescent, grows irritable, suspicious, and\r\ndistant,--and by the time he can resume his customary occupations,\r\nlooks on his dear benefactor and saviour as a designing rascal, bent\r\non plundering him of his worldly possessions. Euricus Cordus, who died\r\nin 1535, seems to have taken the worst possible time for getting his\r\npayment; but it cannot be regretted that he did so, as his experiences\r\ninspired him to write the following excellent epigram:--\r\n\r\n    \"Tres medicus facies habet; unam quando rogatur,\r\n    Angelicam; mox est, cum juvat, ipse Deus.\r\n    Post ubi curato, poscit sua prœmia, morbo,\r\n    Horridus apparet, terribilisque Sathan.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Three faces wears the doctor: when first sought,\r\n    An angel's--and a God's the cure half wrought:\r\n    But when, that cure complete, he seeks his fee,\r\n    The Devil looks then less terrible than he.\"\r\n\r\nIllustrative of the same truth is a story told of Bouvart. On entering\r\none morning the chamber of a French Marquis, whom he had attended\r\nthrough a very dangerous illness, he was accosted by his noble patient\r\nin the following terms:--\r\n\r\n\"Good day to you, Mr. Bouvart; I feel quite in spirits, and think my\r\nfever has left me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure it has,\" replied Bouvart, dryly. \"The very first expression\r\nyou used convinced me of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pray, explain yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing is easier. In the first days of your illness, when your life\r\nwas in danger, I was your _dearest friend_; as you began to get\r\nbetter, I was your _good Bouvart_; and now I am Mr. Bouvart: depend\r\nupon it you are quite recovered.\"\r\n\r\nIn fact, the affection of a patient for his physician is very like the\r\nlove a candidate for a borough has for an individual elector--he is\r\nvery grateful to him, till he has got all he wants out of him. The\r\nmedical practitioner is unwise not to recognize this fact. Common\r\nprudence enjoins him to act as much as possible on the maxim of\r\n\"accipe dum dolet\"--\"take your fee while your patient is in pain.\"\r\n\r\nBut though physicians have always held themselves open to take as much\r\nas they can get, their ordinary remuneration has been fixed in divers\r\ntimes by custom, according to the locality of their practice, the rank\r\nof their patients, the nature of the particular services rendered, and\r\nsuch other circumstances. In China the rule is \"no cure, no pay,\" save\r\nat the Imperial court, where the physicians have salaries that are cut\r\noff during the continuance of royal indisposition. For their sakes it\r\nis to be hoped that the Emperor is a temperate man, and does not\r\nfollow the example of George the Fourth, who used to drink Maraschino\r\nbetween midnight and four o'clock in the morning; and then, when he\r\nawoke with a furred tongue, from disturbed sleep, used to put himself\r\nunder the hands of his doctors. Formerly the medical officers of the\r\nEnglish monarch were paid by salary, though doubtless they were\r\noffered, and were not too proud to accept, fees as well. Coursus de\r\nGungeland, Edward the Third's apothecary, had a pension of sixpence\r\na-day--a considerable sum at that time; and Ricardus Wye, the surgeon\r\nof the same king, had twelve-pence a day, and eight marks per annum.\r\n\"Duodecim denarios per diem, et octo marcas per annum, pro vadiis suis\r\npro vitâ.\" In the royal courts of Wales, also, the fees of surgeons\r\nand physicians were fixed by law--a surgeon receiving, as payment for\r\ncuring a slight wound, only the blood-stained garments of the injured\r\nperson; but for healing a dangerous wound he had the bloody apparel,\r\nhis board and lodging during the time his services were required, and\r\none hundred and eighty pence.\r\n\r\nAt a very early period in England a doctor looked for his palm to be\r\ncrossed with gold, if his patient happened to be a man of condition.\r\nIn Henry VIII.'s reign a Cambridge physician was presented by the Earl\r\nof Cumberland with a fee of £1--but this was at least double what a\r\ncommoner would then have paid. Stow complains that while in Holland\r\nhalf-a-crown was looked upon as a proper remuneration for a single\r\nvisit paid by a skilled physician, the medical practitioners of London\r\nscorned \"to touch any metal but gold.\"\r\n\r\nIt is no matter of uncertainty what the physician's ordinary fee was\r\nat the close of the sixteenth and the commencement of the seventeenth\r\ncentury. It was ten shillings, as is certified by the following\r\nextract from \"Physick lies a-bleeding: the Apothecary turned\r\nDoctor\"--published in 1697:--\r\n\r\n\"_Gallipot_--Good sir, be not so unreasonably passionate and I'll tell\r\nyou. Sir, the Pearl Julep will be 6_s._ 8_d._, Pearls being dear since\r\nour clipt money was bought. The Specific Bolus, 4_s._ 6_d._, I never\r\nreckon less; my master in Leadenhall Street never set down less, be it\r\nwhat it would. The Antihysterick Application 3_s._ 6_d._ (a common one\r\nis but 2_s._ 6_d._), and the Anodyne Draught 3_s._ 4_d._--that's all,\r\nsir; a small matter and please you, sir, for your lady. My fee is what\r\nyou please, sir. All the bill is _but_ 18_s._\r\n\r\n\"_Trueman_--Faith, then, d'ye make a _but_ at it? I do suppose, to be\r\nvery genteel, I must give you a crown.\r\n\r\n\"_Gallipot_--If your worship please; I take it to be a fair and an\r\nhonest bill.\r\n\r\n\"_Trueman_--Do you indeed? But I wish you had called a doctor, perhaps\r\nhe would have advised her to have forebore taking anything, as yet at\r\nleast, so I had saved 13_s._ in my pocket.\"\r\n\r\n\"Physick lies a-bleeding\" was written during the great Dispensarian\r\nWar, which is touched upon in another part of these pages; and its\r\nobject was to hold up physicians as models of learning and probity,\r\nand to expose the extortionate practices of the apothecaries. It must\r\ntherefore be read with caution, and with due allowance for the license\r\nof satire, and the violence of a party statement. But the statement\r\nthat 10_s._ was the _customary_ fee is clearly one that may be\r\naccepted as truthful. Indeed, the unknown and needy doctors were glad\r\nto accept less. The author of \"The Dispensarians are the Patriots of\r\nBritain,\" published in 1708, represents the humbler physicians being\r\nnothing better than the slaves of the opulent apothecaries, accepting\r\nhalf their right fee, and taking instead 25 or 50 per cent. of the\r\namount paid for drugs to the apothecary. \"They (the powerful\r\ntraders),\" says the writer, \"offered the Physicians 5_s._ and 10_s._\r\nin the pound, to excite their industry to prescribe the larger\r\nabundance to all the disorders.\"\r\n\r\nBut physicians daily received more than their ten shillings at a time.\r\nIn confirmation of this, a good anecdote may be related of Sir\r\nTheodore Mayerne. Sir Theodore Mayerne, a native of Geneva, was\r\nphysician to Henry IV. and Louis XIII. of France, and subsequently to\r\nJames I., Charles I., and Charles II. of England. As a physician, who\r\nhad the honour of attending many crowned heads, he ranks above Caius,\r\nwho was physician to Edward VI., Mary, and Elizabeth--Ambrose Paré,\r\nthe inventor of ligatures for severed arteries, who was physician and\r\nsurgeon to Henry II., Francis II., Charles IX., and Henry III. of\r\nFrance--and Sir Henry Halford, who attended successively George III.,\r\nGeorge IV., William IV., and Victoria. It is told of Sir Theodore,\r\nthat when a friend, after consulting him, foolishly put two broad gold\r\npieces (six-and-thirty shillings each) on the table, he quietly\r\npocketed them. The patient, who, as a friend, expected to have his fee\r\nrefused, and therefore (deeming it well to indulge in the magnificence\r\nof generosity when it would cost him nothing) had absurdly exhibited\r\nso large a sum, did not at all relish the sight of its being netted.\r\nHis countenance, if not his tongue, made his mortification manifest.\r\n\"Sir,\" said Sir Theodore, \"I made my will this morning; and if it\r\nshould appear that I refused a fee, I might be deemed _non compos_.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Levamen Infirmi,\" published in 1700, shows that a century had\r\nnot, at that date, made much difference in the scale of remuneration\r\naccorded to surgeons and physicians. \"To a graduate in physick,\" this\r\nauthority states, \"his due is about ten shillings, though he commonly\r\nexpects or demands twenty. Those that are only licensed physicians,\r\ntheir due is no more than six shillings and eight-pence, though they\r\ncommonly demand ten shillings. A surgeon's fee is twelve-pence a mile,\r\nbe his journey far or near; ten groats to set a bone broke, or out of\r\njoint; and for letting blood one shilling; the cutting off or\r\namputation of any limb is five pounds, but there is no settled price\r\nfor the cure.\" These charges are much the same as those made at the\r\npresent day by country surgeons to their less wealthy patients, with\r\nthe exception of a fee for setting a bone, or reducing a dislocation,\r\nwhich is absurdly out of proportion to the rest of the sums mentioned.\r\n\r\nMr William Wadd, in his very interesting \"Memorabilia,\" states, that\r\nthe physicians who attended Queen Caroline had five hundred guineas,\r\nand the surgeons three hundred guineas each; and that Dr. Willis was\r\nrewarded for his successful attendance on his Majesty King George\r\nIII., by £1500 per annum for twenty years, and £650 per annum to his\r\nson for life. The other physicians, however, had only thirty guineas\r\neach visit to Windsor, and ten guineas each visit to Kew.\r\n\r\nThese large fees put us in mind of one that ought to have been paid to\r\nDr. King for his attendance on Charles the Second. Evelyn\r\nrelates--\"1685, Feb. 4, I went to London, hearing his Majesty had ben,\r\nthe Monday before (2 Feb.), surprised in his bed-chamber with an\r\napoplectic fit; so that if, by God's providence, Dr King (that\r\nexcellent chirurgeon as well as physitian) had not been actually\r\npresent, to let his bloud (having his lancet in his pocket), his\r\nMajesty had certainly died that moment, which might have ben of\r\ndireful consequence, there being nobody else present with the king\r\nsave this doctor and one more, as I am assured. It was a mark of the\r\nextraordinary dexterity, resolution, and presence of mind in the Dr\r\nto let him bloud in the very paroxysm, without staying the coming of\r\nother physicians, which regularly should have ben done, and for want\r\nof which he must have a regular pardon, as they tell me.\" For this\r\npromptitude and courage the Privy-Council ordered £1000 to be given to\r\nDr. King--but he never obtained the money.\r\n\r\nIn a more humourous, but not less agreeable manner, Dr. Hunter (John\r\nHunter's brother), was disappointed of payment for his professional\r\nservices. On a certain occasion he was suffering under such severe\r\nindisposition that he was compelled to keep his bed, when a lady\r\ncalled and implored to be admitted to his chamber for the benefit of\r\nhis advice. After considerable resistance on the part of the servants,\r\nshe obtained her request; and the sick physician, sitting up in his\r\nbed, attended to her case, and prescribed for it. \"What is your fee,\r\nsir?\" the lady asked when the work was done. The doctor, with the\r\nprudent delicacy of his order, informed his patient that it was a rule\r\nwith him never to fix his fee; and, on repeated entreaty that he would\r\ndepart from his custom, refused to do so. On this the lady rose from\r\nher seat, and courteously thanking the doctor, left him--not a little\r\nannoyed at the result of his squeamishness or artifice.\r\n\r\nThis puts us in mind of the manner in which an eminent surgeon not\r\nlong since was defrauded of a fee, under circumstances that must rouse\r\nthe indignation of every honourable man against the delinquent. Mr.\r\n---- received, in his consulting room, a gentleman of military and\r\nprepossessing exterior, who, after detailing the history of his\r\nsufferings, implored the professional man he addressed to perform for\r\nhim a certain difficult and important operation. The surgeon\r\nconsented, and on being asked what remuneration he would require, said\r\nthat his fee was a hundred guineas.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" replied the visitor with some embarrassment, \"I am very sorry\r\nto hear you say so. I feel sure my case without you will terminate\r\nfatally; but I am a poor half-pay officer, in pecuniary difficulties,\r\nand I could not, even if it were to save my soul, raise half the sum\r\nyou mention.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear sir,\" responded the surgeon frankly, and with the generosity\r\nwhich is more frequently found amongst medical practitioners than any\r\nother class of men, \"don't then disturb yourself. I cannot take a less\r\nfee than I have stated, for my character demands that I should not\r\nhave two charges, but I am at liberty to remit my fee altogether.\r\nAllow me, then, the very great pleasure of attending a retired officer\r\nof the British army gratuitously.\"\r\n\r\nThis kindly offer was accepted. Mr. ---- not only performed the\r\noperation, but visited his patient daily for more than three weeks\r\nwithout ever accepting a guinea--and three months after he had\r\nrestored the sick man to health, discovered that, instead of being in\r\nnecessitous circumstances, he was a magistrate and deputy-lieutenant\r\nfor his county, and owner of a fine landed estate.\r\n\r\n\"And, by ----!\" exclaimed the fine-hearted surgeon--when he narrated\r\nthis disgraceful affair, \"I'll act exactly in the same way to the next\r\npoor man who gives me his _word of honour_ that he is not rich enough\r\nto pay me.\"\r\n\r\nThe success of Sir Astley Cooper was beyond that of any medical\r\npractitioner of modern times; but it came very gradually. His earnings\r\nfor the first nine years of his professional career progressed\r\nthus:--In the first year he netted five guineas; in the second,\r\ntwenty-six pounds; in the third, sixty-four pounds; in the fourth,\r\nninety-six pounds; in the fifth, a hundred pounds; in the sixth, two\r\nhundred pounds; in the seventh, four hundred pounds; in the eighth,\r\nsix hundred and ten pounds; and in the ninth, the year in which he\r\nsecured his hospital appointment, eleven hundred pounds. But the time\r\ncame when the patients stood for hours in his ante-rooms waiting to\r\nhave an interview with the great surgeon, and after all, their\r\npatients were dismissed without being admitted to the consulting-room.\r\nSir Astley's man, Charles, with all the dignity that became so eminent\r\na man's servant, used to say to these disappointed applicants, in a\r\ntone of magnificent patronage, when they reappeared the next morning\r\nafter their effectless visit, \"I am not at all sure that _we_ shall be\r\nable to attend to-day to you, gentlemen, for _we_ are excessively\r\nbusy, and our list is perfectly full for the day; but if you'll wait I\r\nwill see what can be done for you!\"\r\n\r\nThe highest amount that Sir Astley received in any one year was\r\n£21,000. This splendid income was an exceptional one. For many years,\r\nhowever, he achieved more than £15,000 per annum. As long as he lived\r\nin the City after becoming celebrated he made an enormous, but\r\nfluctuating, revenue, the state of the money-market having an almost\r\nlaughable effect on the size of the fees paid him. The capitalists\r\nwho visited the surgeon in Broad Street, in three cases out of four,\r\npaid in cheques, and felt it beneath their dignity to put pen to paper\r\nfor a smaller sum than five guineas. After Sir Astley moved to the\r\nWest End he had a more numerous and at the same time more aristocratic\r\npractice; but his receipts were never so much as they were when he\r\ndwelt within the Lord Mayor's jurisdiction. His more distinguished\r\npatients invariably paid their guineas in cash, and many of them did\r\nnot consider it inconsistent with patrician position to give single\r\nfees. The citizens were the fellows to pay. Mr. William Coles, of\r\nMincing Lane, for a long period paid Sir Astley £600 a year, the\r\nvisits of the latter being principally made to Mr. Cole's seat near\r\nCroydon. Another \"City man,\" who consulted the surgeon in Broad\r\nStreet, and departed without putting down any honorarium whatever,\r\nsent a cheque for £63 10_s._, with the following characteristic\r\nnote:--\r\n\r\n\"DEAR SIR--When I had first the pleasure of seeing you, you requested,\r\nas a favour, that I would consider your visit on the occasion as a\r\nfriend. I now, sir, must request you will return the compliment by\r\naccepting the enclosed draft as an act of friendship. It is the profit\r\non £2000 of the ensuing loan, out of a small sum Sir F. Baring had\r\ngiven, of appropriating for your chance.\"\r\n\r\nThe largest fee Sir Astley Cooper ever received was paid him by a West\r\nIndian millionaire named Hyatt. This gentleman having occasion to\r\nundergo a painful and perilous operation, was attended by Drs. Lettsom\r\nand Nelson as physicians, and Sir Astley as chirurgeon. The wealthy\r\npatient, his treatment having resulted most successfully, was so\r\ndelighted that he fee'd his physicians with 300 guineas each. \"But\r\nyou, sir,\" cried the grateful old man, sitting up in his bed, and\r\nspeaking to his surgeon, \"shall have something better. There,\r\nsir--take _that_.\" The _that_ was the convalescent's night-cap, which\r\nhe flung at the dexterous operator. \"Sir,\" replied Sir Astley, picking\r\nup the cap, \"I'll pocket the affront.\" It was well he did so, for on\r\nreaching home he found in the cap a draft for 1000 guineas. This story\r\nhas been told in various ways, but all its tellers agree as to the\r\namount of the prize.\r\n\r\nCatherine, the Empress of Russia, was even more munificent than the\r\nWest Indian planter. When Dr. Dimsdale, for many years a Hertford\r\nphysician, and subsequently the parliamentary representative of that\r\nborough, went over to Russia and inoculated the Empress and her son,\r\nin the year 1768, he was rewarded with a fee of £12,000, a pension for\r\nlife of £500 per annum, and the rank of Baron of the Empire. But if\r\nCatherine paid thus handsomely for increased security of life, a\r\nmodern emperor of Austria put down a yet more royal fee for his\r\ndeath-warrant. When on his death-bed the Emperor Joseph asked Quarin\r\nhis opinion of his case, the physician told the monarch that he could\r\nnot possibly live forty-eight hours. In acknowledgment of this frank\r\ndeclaration of the truth, the Emperor created Quarin a Baron, and gave\r\nhim a pension of more than £2000 per annum to support the rank with.\r\n\r\nA goodly collection might be made of eccentric fees given to the\r\npractitioners of the healing art. William Butler, who, in his\r\nmoroseness of manner, was the prototype of Abernethy, found (_vide_\r\nFuller's \"English Worthies\") more pleasure in \"presents than money;\r\nloved what was pretty rather than what was costly; and preferred\r\nrarities to riches.\" The number of physicians is large who have won\r\nthe hands of heiresses in the discharge of their professional\r\navocations. But of them we purpose to speak at length hereafter.\r\nJoshua Ward, the Thames Street drysalter, who made a fortune by his\r\n\"Drop and Pill,\"\r\n\r\n    \"Of late, without the least pretence to skill,\r\n    Ward's grown a famed physician by a pill,\"\r\n\r\nwas so successfully puffed by Lord Chief Baron Reynolds and General\r\nChurchill, that he was called in to prescribe for the king. The royal\r\nmalady disappeared in consequence, or in spite, of the treatment; and\r\nWard was rewarded with a solemn vote of the House of Commons,\r\nprotecting him from the interdictions of the College of Physicians;\r\nand, as an additional fee, he asked for, and obtained, the privilege\r\nof driving his carriage through St. James's Park.\r\n\r\nThe pertinacity with which the members of the medical profession cling\r\nto the shilling of \"the guinea\" is amusing. When Erskine used to order\r\n\"The Devil's Own\" to _charge_, he would cry out \"Six-and-eightpence!\"\r\ninstead of the ordinary word of command. Had his Lordship been colonel\r\nof a volunteer corps of physicians, he would have roused them to an\r\nonward march by \"A guinea!\" Sometimes patients object to pay the extra\r\nshilling over the sovereign, not less than their medical advisers\r\ninsist on having it. \"We surgeons do things by guineas,\" we recollect\r\na veteran hospital surgeon saying to a visitor who had put down the\r\nlargest current gold piece of our present coinage. The patient (an\r\nirritable old gentleman) made it a question of principle; he hated\r\nhumbug--he regarded \"that shilling\" as sheer humbug, and he would not\r\npay it. A contest ensued, which terminated in the eccentric patient\r\npaying, not the shilling, but an additional sovereign. And to this day\r\nhe is a frequent visitor of our surgical ally, and is well content to\r\npay his two sovereigns, though he would die rather than countenance \"a\r\nsham\" by putting down \"a guinea.\"\r\n\r\nBut of all the stories told of surgeons who have grown fat at the\r\nexpense of the public, the best is the following one, for which Mr.\r\nAlexander Kellet, who died at his lodgings in Bath, in the year 1788\r\nis our authority. A certain French surgeon residing in Georgia was\r\ntaken prisoner by some Indians, who having acquired from the French\r\nthe art of larding their provisions, determined to lard this\r\nparticular Frenchman, and then roast him alive. During the culinary\r\nprocess, when the man was half larded, the operators were surprised by\r\nthe enemy, and their victim, making his escape, lived many days in the\r\nwoods on the bacon he had in his skin.\r\n\r\nIf full reliance may be placed on the following humorous verses, it is\r\nnot unknown for a physician to be paid in commodities, without the\r\nintervention of the circulating medium, or the receipt of such\r\ncreature comforts as Johnson's friendly apothecary was wont to accept\r\nin lieu of cash:--\r\n\r\n    \"An adept in the sister arts,\r\n      Painter, poet, and musician,\r\n    Employ'd a doctor of all parts,\r\n      Druggist, surgeon, and physician.\r\n\r\n    \"The artist with M.D. agrees,\r\n      If he'd attend him when he grew sick,\r\n    Fully to liquidate his fees\r\n      With painting, poetry, and music.\r\n\r\n    \"The druggist, surgeon, and physician,\r\n      So often physick'd, bled, prescribed,\r\n    That painter, poet, and musician\r\n      (Alas! poor artist!) sunk--and died.\r\n\r\n    \"But ere death's stroke, 'Doctor,' cried he,\r\n      'In honour of your skill and charge,\r\n    Accept from my professions three--\r\n      A _hatchment_, _epitaph_, and _dirge_.'\"\r\n\r\nA double fee for good news has long been a rule in the profession. A\r\nfather just presented with an heir, or a lucky fellow just made one,\r\nis expected to bleed freely for the benefit of the Faculty.\r\n\r\n    \"Madam scolded one day so long,\r\n    She sudden lost all use of tongue!\r\n    The doctor came--with hum and haw,\r\n    Pronounc'd th' affection a lock'd jaw!\r\n\r\n    'What hopes, good sir?'--'Small, small, I see!'\r\n    The husband slips a _double fee_;\r\n    'What, no hopes, doctor?'--'None, I fear;'\r\n    Another fee for issue clear.\r\n\r\n    \"Madam deceased--'Pray, sir, don't grieve!'\r\n    'My friends, one comfort I receive--\r\n    A _lock'd jaw_ was the only case\r\n    From which my wife could die--in peace.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nPEDAGOGUES TURNED DOCTORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the church of St. Mary Magdalen, Taunton, is a monumental stone\r\nengraved with the following inscription:--\r\n\r\n    \"Qui medicus doctus, prudentis nomine clarus,\r\n      Eloquii splendor, Pieridumque decus,\r\n    Virtutis cultor, pietatis vixit amicus;\r\n      Hoc jacet in tumulo, spiritus alta tenet.\"\r\n\r\nIt is in memory of John Bond, M.A., the learned commentator on Horace\r\nand Persius. Educated at Winchester school, and then at New College,\r\nOxford, he was elected master of the Taunton Grammar-school in the\r\nyear 1579. For many years he presided over that seminary with great\r\nefficiency, and sent out into the world several eminent scholars. On\r\narriving, however, at the middle age of life, he relinquished the\r\nmastership of the school, and turned his attention to the practice of\r\nmedicine. His reputation and success as a physician were great--the\r\nworthy people of Taunton honouring him as \"a wise man.\" He died August\r\n3, 1612.\r\n\r\nMore than a century later than John Bond, schoolmaster and physician,\r\nappeared a greater celebrity in the person of James Jurin, who, from\r\nthe position of a provincial pedagogue, raised himself to be regarded\r\nas first of the London physicians, and conspicuous amongst the\r\nphilosophers of Europe. Jurin was born in 1684, and received his early\r\neducation at Christ's Hospital--better known to the public as the\r\nBluecoat school. After graduating in arts at Cambridge, he obtained\r\nthe mastership of the grammar-school of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, January,\r\n1710. In the following year he acquired the high academic distinction\r\nof a fellowship on the foundation of Trinity College; and the year\r\nafter (1712) he published through the University press, his edition of\r\nVarenius's Geography, dedicated to Bentley. In 1718 and 1719 he\r\ncontributed to the Philosophical Transactions the essays which\r\ninvolved him in controversies with Keill and Senac, and were, in the\r\nyear 1732, reprinted in a collected form, under the title of\r\n\"Physico-Mathematical Dissertations.\" Another of his important\r\ncontributions to science was \"An Essay on Distinct and Indistinct\r\nVision,\" added to Smith's \"System of Optics.\" Voltaire was not without\r\ngood reason for styling him, in the _Journal de Savans_, \"the famous\r\nJurin.\"\r\n\r\nBesides working zealously in his school, Jurin delivered lectures at\r\nNewcastle, on Experimental Philosophy. He worked very hard, his\r\nimmediate object being to get and save money. As soon as he had laid\r\nby a clear thousand pounds, he left Newcastle, and returning to his\r\nUniversity devoted himself to the study of medicine. From that time\r\nhis course was a prosperous one. Having taken his M.D. degree, he\r\nsettled in London, became a Fellow of the College of Physicians, a\r\nFellow of the Royal Society (to which distinguished body he became\r\nsecretary on the resignation of Dr. Halley in 1721), and a Physician\r\nof Guy's Hospital, as well as Governor of St. Thomas's. The friend of\r\nSir Isaac Newton and Bentley did not lack patients. The\r\nconsulting-rooms and ante-chambers of his house in Lincoln's Inn\r\nFields received many visitors; so that he acquired considerable\r\nwealth, and had an estate and an imposing establishment at Clapton.\r\nNichols speaks of him in one of his volumes as \"James Jurin, M.D.,\r\nsometime of Clapton in Hackney.\" It was, however, at his town\r\nresidence that he died, March 22, 1750, of what the _Gentleman's\r\nMagazine_ calls \"a dead palsy,\" leaving by his will a considerable\r\nlegacy to Christ's Hospital.\r\n\r\nOne might make a long list of Doctors Pedagogic, including poor Oliver\r\nGoldsmith, who used to wince and redden with shame and anger when the\r\ncant phrase, \"It's all a holiday at Peckham,\" saluted his ears.\r\nBetween Bond and Jurin, however, there were two tutors turned\r\nphysicians, who may not be passed over without especial attention.\r\nOnly a little prior to Jurin they knew many of his friends, and\r\ndoubtless met him often in consultation. They were both authors--one\r\nof rare wit, and the other (as he himself boasted) of no wit; and they\r\nhated each other, as literary men know how to hate. In every respect,\r\neven down to the quarters of town which they inhabited, they were\r\nopposed to each other. One was a brilliant talker and frequented St.\r\nJames's; the other was a pompous drone, and haunted the Mansion-house:\r\na Jacobite the one, a Whig the other. The reader sees that these two\r\nworthies can be none other than Arbuthnot and Blackmore.\r\n\r\nA wily, courtly, mirth-loving Scotchman, Arbuthnot had all the best\r\nqualities that are to be ordinarily found in a child of North Britain.\r\nEverybody knew him--nearly every one liked him. His satire, that was\r\nonly rarely tinctured with bitterness--his tongue, powerful to mimic,\r\nflatter, or persuade--his polished manners and cordial bearing, would\r\nalone have made him a favourite with the ladies, had he not been what\r\nhe was--one of the handsomest men about town. (Of course, in\r\nappearance he did not approach that magnificent gentleman, Beau\r\nFielding). In conversation he was frank without being noisy; and there\r\nhung about him--tavern-haunting wit though he was--an air of\r\nsimplicity, tempering his reckless fun, that was very pleasant and\r\nvery winning. Pope, Parnell, Garth, Gay, were society much more to his\r\ntaste than the stately big-wigs of Warwick Hall. And next to drinking\r\nwine with such men, the good-humoured doctor enjoyed flirting with the\r\nmaids of honour, and taking part in a political intrigue. No wonder\r\nthat Swift valued him as a priceless treasure--\"loved him,\" as he\r\nwrote to Stella, \"ten times as much\" as jolly, tippling Dr. Freind.\r\n\r\nIt was arm in arm with him that the Dean used to peer about St.\r\nJames's, jesting, snarling, laughing, causing dowagers to smile at\r\n\"that dear Mr. Dean,\" and young girls, up for their first year at\r\nCourt--green and unsophisticated--to blush with annoyance at his\r\ncoarse, shameless badinage; bowing to this great man (from whom he\r\nhoped for countenance), staring insolently at that one (from whom he\r\nwas sure of nothing but enmity), quoting Martial to a mitred courtier\r\n(because the prelate couldn't understand Latin), whispering French to\r\na youthful diplomatist (because the boy knew no tongue but English),\r\npreparing impromptu compliments for \"royal Anna\" (as our dear worthy\r\nancestors used to call Mrs. Masham's intimate friend), or with his\r\nglorious blue eyes sending a glance, eloquent of admiration and\r\nhomage, at a fair and influential supporter; cringing, fawning,\r\nflattering--in fact, angling for the bishopric he was never to get.\r\nWith Arbuthnot it was that Swift tried the dinners and wine of every\r\nhotel round Covent Garden, or in the city. From Arbuthnot it was that\r\nthe Dean, during his periods of official exile, received his best and\r\nsurest information of the battles of the cliques, the scandals of the\r\nCourt, the contentions of parties, the prospects of ministers, and\r\n(most important subject by far) the health of the Queen.\r\n\r\nSome of the most pleasant pictures in the \"Journal to Stella\" are\r\nthose in which the kindly presence of the Doctor softens the asperity\r\nof the Dean. Most readers of these pages have accompanied the two\r\n\"brothers\" in their excursion to the course the day before the\r\nhorse-races, when they overtook Miss Forrester, the pretty maid of\r\nhonour, and made her accompany them. The lady was taking the air on\r\nher palfrey, habited in the piquant riding-dress of the period--the\r\nnatty three-cornered cocked hat, ornamented with gold lace, and\r\nperched on the top of a long flowing periwig, powdered to the\r\nwhiteness of snow, the long coat cut like a coachman's, the waistcoat\r\nflapped and faced, and lastly the habit-skirt. One sees the belle at\r\nthis time smiling archly, with all the power of beauty, and shaking\r\nthe handle of her whip at the divine and the physician. So they took\r\nher with them (and they weren't wrong in doing so). Then the old Queen\r\ncame by, gouty and hypochondriac. Off went the hats of the two\r\ncourtiers in the presence of her Majesty. The beauty, too, raised her\r\nlittle three-cornered cock-boat (rising on her stirrup as she did so),\r\nand returned it to the summit of the flowing wig, with a knowing\r\nside-glance, as much as to say, \"See, sirs, we women can do that sort\r\nof thing quite as gracefully as the lords of the creation.\" (Oh, Mr.\r\nSpectator, how could you find it in you to quarrel with that costume?)\r\nSwift was charmed, and described enough of the scene to make that\r\nfoolish Stella frantically jealous; and then, prudent, canny\r\nlove-tyrant that he was, added with a sneer--\"I did not like her,\r\nthough she be a toast, and was dressed like a man.\" And you may be\r\nsure that poor little Stella was both fool enough and wise enough both\r\nto believe and disbelieve this assurance at the same time.\r\n\r\nArbuthnot owed his success in no degree whatever to the influence of\r\nhis family, and only in a very slight degree to his professional\r\nknowledge. His father was only a poor episcopalian clergyman, and his\r\nM.D. degree was only an Aberdeen one. He rose by his wit, rare\r\nconversational powers, and fascinating address, achieving eminence at\r\nCourt because he was the greatest master of fence with the weapon that\r\nis most used in courts--the tongue. He failed to get a living amongst\r\nrustic boors, who appreciated no effort of the human voice but a\r\nfox-hunter's whoop. Dorchester, where as a young man he endeavoured\r\nto establish himself in practice, refused to give him an income, but\r\nit doubtless maintained more than one dull empiric in opulence. In\r\nLondon he met with a different reception. For a time he was very poor,\r\nand resorted to the most hateful of all occupations--the personal\r\ninstruction of the ignorant. How long he was so engaged is uncertain.\r\nSomething of Goldsmith's \"Peckham\" sensibility made him not care in\r\nafter-life to talk of the days when he was a teacher of\r\nmathematics--starving on pupils until he should be permitted to grow\r\nfat on patients.\r\n\r\nThe patients were not long in coming. The literary reputation he\r\nobtained by his \"Examination of Dr Woodward's Account of the Deluge,\"\r\nelicited by Woodward's \"Essay towards a Natural History of the Earth,\"\r\ninstead of frightening the sick from him, brought them to him.\r\nAccidentally called in to Prince George of Denmark, when his Royal\r\nHighness was suddenly taken ill at Epsom, he made himself so agreeable\r\nthat the casual introduction became a permanent connection. In 1709,\r\non the illness of Hannes (a physician who also understood the art of\r\nrising in spite of obstacles) he was appointed physician-in-ordinary\r\nto Queen Anne.\r\n\r\nTo secure the good graces of his royal patient, and rise yet higher in\r\nthem, he adopted a tone of affection for her as a person, as well as\r\nloyal devotion to her as a queen. The fall of Radcliffe warned him\r\nthat he had need of caution in dealing with the weak-minded,\r\nquerulous, crotchety, self-indulgent invalid.\r\n\r\n\"What's the time?\" asked the Queen of him one day.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever it may please your Majesty,\" answered the court-physician,\r\nwith a graceful bow.\r\n\r\nAfter all, the best testimony of a man's merit is the opinion held of\r\nhim by those of his acquaintance who know him intimately--at home as\r\nwell as abroad. By all who came within the circle of Arbuthnot's\r\nprivacy he was respected as much as loved. And his associates were no\r\ncommon men. Pope, addressing him as \"the friend of his life,\" says:--\r\n\r\n    \"Why did I write? what sin, to me unknown,\r\n    Dipp'd me in ink?--my parents' or my own?\r\n    As yet a child, nor yet a fool to fame,\r\n    I lisp'd in numbers, for the numbers came.\r\n    I left no calling for this idle trade,\r\n    No duty broke, no father disobey'd.\r\n    The muse but served to ease some friend, not wife,\r\n    To help me through this long disease, my life,\r\n    To second, Arbuthnot! thy art and care,\r\n    And teach the being you preserved to bear.\"\r\n\r\nPope's concluding wish--\r\n\r\n         \"Oh, friend! may each domestic bliss be thine.\"\r\n\r\nwas ineffectual. Arbuthnot's health failed under his habits of\r\nintemperance, and during his latter years he was a terrible sufferer\r\nfrom asthma and melancholy. After the Queen's death he went for the\r\nbenefit of his health on the continent, and visited his brother, a\r\nParis banker. Returning to London he took a house in Dover Street,\r\nfrom which he moved to the residence in Cork Street, Burlington\r\nGardens, where he died Feb. 27, 1734-5. He died in straitened\r\ncircumstances; for unlike his fellow-countryman, Colonel Chartres, he\r\nhad not the faculty of saving. But with failing energies, an\r\nexcruciated frame, and the heart-burden of a family unprovided for, he\r\nmaintained a philosophic equanimity, and displayed his old unvarying\r\nconsideration for all who surrounded him.\r\n\r\nArbuthnot's epitaph on Colonel Chartres (almost as well known as\r\nMartinus Scriblerus) is a good specimen of his humour:--\r\n\r\n                    \"Here continueth to rot,\r\n                The Body of Francis Chartres.\r\n            Who, with an indefatigable constancy,\r\n              And inimitable Uniformity of life,\r\n                              Persisted,\r\n                In spite of Age and Infirmities,\r\n              In the practice of every Human Vice,\r\n            Excepting Prodigality and Hypocrisy:\r\n    His insatiable Avarice exempting him from the First,\r\n        His matchless impudence from the Second.\r\n    Nor was he more singular in the Undeviating Pravity\r\n              Of his manners, than successful\r\n                In accumulating Wealth:\r\n            For, without Trade or Profession,\r\n              Without trust of public money,\r\n            And without bribe-worthy service,\r\n          He acquired, or more properly created,\r\n                  A ministerial estate.\r\n            He was the only person of this time\r\n        Who could cheat without the Mask of Honesty,\r\n      Retain his primæval meanness when possessed of\r\n                      Ten thousand a-year:\r\n    And having duly deserved the Gibbet for what he did,\r\n    Was at last condemned to it for what he could not do.\r\n                      Oh, indignant reader!\r\n            Think not his life useless to mankind:\r\n          Providence connived at his execrable designs,\r\n              To give to After-age a conspicuous\r\n                      Proof and Example\r\n          Of how small estimation is exorbitant Wealth\r\n          In the sight of God, by His bestowing it on\r\n                The most unworthy of Mortals.\"\r\n\r\nThe history of the worthy person whose reputation is here embalmed is\r\ninteresting. Beginning life as an ensign in the army, he was drummed\r\nout of his regiment, banished Brussels, and ignominiously expelled\r\nfrom Ghent, for cheating. As a miser he saved, and as a usurer he\r\nincreased, the money which he won as a blackleg and card-sharper.\r\nTwice was he condemned to death for heinous offences, but contrived to\r\npurchase pardon; and, after all, he was fortunate enough to die in his\r\nown bed, in his native country, Scotland, A. D. 1731, aged sixty-two.\r\nAt his funeral the indignant mob, feeling that justice had not been\r\ndone to the dear departed, raised a riot, insulted the mourners, and,\r\nwhen the coffin was lowered into the grave, threw upon it a\r\nmagnificent collection of dead dogs!\r\n\r\nIn a similar and scarcely less magnificent vein of humour, Arbuthnot\r\nwrote another epitaph--on a greyhound:--\r\n\r\n                         \"To the memory of\r\n                            Signor Fido,\r\n                An Italian of Good Extraction:\r\n                    Who came into England,\r\n            Not to bite us, like most of his countrymen,\r\n                  But to gain an honest livelihood:\r\n                    He hunted not after fame,\r\n                          Yet acquired it:\r\n              Regardless of the Praise of his Friends,\r\n                  But most sensible of their love:\r\n                  Tho' he liv'd amongst the great,\r\n              He neither learn'd nor flatter'd any vice:\r\n                        He was no Bigot,\r\n        Tho' he doubted of none of the thirty-nine articles;\r\n                    And if to follow Nature,\r\n                And to respect the laws of Society,\r\n                          Be Philosophy,\r\n                  He was a perfect Phi losopher,\r\n                        A faithful Friend,\r\n                      An agreeable Companion,\r\n                        A loving Husband,\r\n              Distinguished by a numerous Offspring,\r\n          All of which he lived to see take good _courses_;\r\n                  In his old age he retired\r\n          To the House of a Clergyman in the Country,\r\n                Where he finished his earthly Race,\r\n    And died an Honour and an Example to the whole Species.\r\n                            Reader,\r\n                This stone is guiltless of Flattery,\r\n                  For he to whom it is inscribed\r\n                           Was not a man,\r\n                                But a\r\n                             Greyhound.\"\r\n\r\nIn the concluding lines there is a touch of Sterne. They also call to\r\nmind Byron's epitaph on his dog.\r\n\r\nThese epitaphs put the writer in mind of the literary ambition of the\r\neminent Dr. James Gregory of Edinburgh. His great aim was to be _the_\r\nInscriptor (as he styled it) of his age. No distinguished person died\r\nwithout the doctor promptly striking off his characteristics in a\r\nmural legend. For every statue erected to heroes, real or sham, he\r\ncomposed an inscription, and interested himself warmly to have it\r\nadopted. Amongst the public monuments on which his compositions may be\r\nfound are the Nelson Monument at Edinburgh, and the Duke of\r\nWellington's shield at Gibraltar. On King Robert Bruce, Charles Edward\r\nStuart, his mother, Sir James Foulis de Collington, and Robertson the\r\nhistorian, he also produced commemorative inscriptions of great\r\nexcellence. As a very fair specimen of his style the inscription on\r\nthe Seott Flagon is transcribed:--\r\n\r\n            \"Gualterum Scott,\r\n              De Abbotsford,\r\n            Virum summi Ingenii\r\n            Scriptorem Elegantem\r\n    Poetarum sui seculi facile Principem\r\n              Patriæ Decus\r\n          Ob varia ergo ipsam merita\r\n        In civium suorum numerum\r\n    Grata adscripsit Civitas Edinburgensis\r\n        Et hoc Cantharo donavit\r\n            A. D. MDCCCXIII.\"\r\n\r\nSir Richard Blackmore, the other pedagogue physician, was one of those\r\ngood, injudicious mortals who always either praise or blame too\r\nmuch--usually the latter. The son of a Wiltshire attorney, he was\r\neducated at Westminster School and Oxford, taking his degree of M.A.\r\nJune, 1676, and residing, in all, thirteen years in the university,\r\nduring a portion of which protracted period of residence he was\r\n(though Dr. Johnson erroneously supposed the reverse) a laborious\r\nstudent. On leaving Oxford he passed through a course of searching\r\npoverty, and became a schoolmaster. In this earlier part of his life\r\nhe travelled in France, Germany, the Low Countries, and Italy, and\r\ntook his doctor's degree in the University of Padua. On turning his\r\nattention to medicine, he consulted Sydenham as to what authors he\r\nought to read. \"Don Quixote,\" replied the veteran. A similar answer\r\nhas been attributed to Lord Erskine on being asked by a law student\r\nthe best literary sources for acquiring legal knowledge and success.\r\nThe scepticism of the reply reminds one of Garth, who, to an anxious\r\npatient inquiring what physician he had best call in in case of his\r\n(Garth's) death, responded, \"One is e'en as good as t'other, and\r\nsurgeons are not less knowing.\"\r\n\r\nAs a poet, Blackmore failed, but as a physician he was for many years\r\none of the most successful men in his profession. Living at Sadler's\r\nHall, Cheapside, he was the oracle of all the wealthiest citizens, and\r\nwas blessed with an affluence that allowed him to drive about town in\r\na handsome equipage, and make an imposing figure to the world.\r\nIndustrious, honourable, and cordially liked by his personal friends,\r\nhe was by no means the paltry fellow that Dryden and Pope represented\r\nhim. Johnson, in his brilliant memoir, treated him very unfairly, and\r\nclearly was annoyed that his conscience would not allow him to treat\r\nhim worse. On altogether insufficient grounds the doctor argued that\r\nhis knowledge of ancient authors was superficial, and for the most\r\npart derived from secondary sources. Passages indeed are introduced to\r\nshow that the ridicule and contempt showered on the poet by his\r\nadversaries, and re-echoed by the laughing world, were unjust; but the\r\neffect of these admissions, complete in themselves, is more than\r\ncounterbalanced by the sarcasms (and some of them vulgar sarcasms too)\r\nwhich the biographer, in imitation of Colonel Codrington, Sir Charles\r\nSedley, and Colonel Blount, directs against the city knight.\r\n\r\nA sincerely religious man, Blackmore was offended with the gross\r\nlicentiousness of the drama, and all those productions of the poets\r\nwhich constituted the light literature of the eighteenth century. To\r\nhis eternal honour, Blackmore was the first man who had the courage to\r\nraise his voice against the evil, and give utterance to a manly\r\nindignation at the insults offered nightly in every theatre to public\r\ndecency. Unskilled in the use of the pen, of an age when he could not\r\nhope to perfect himself in an art to which he had not in youth\r\nsystematically trained himself, and immersed in the cares of an\r\nextensive practice, he set himself to work on the production of a\r\npoem, which should elevate and instruct, not vitiate and deprave\r\nyouthful readers. In this spirit \"Prince Arthur\" was composed and\r\npublished in 1695, when the author was between forty and fifty years\r\nof age. It was written, as he frankly acknowledged, \"by such catches\r\nand starts, and in such occasional uncertain hours as his profession\r\nafforded, and for the greatest part in coffee-houses, or in passing up\r\nand down streets.\" The wits laughed at him for writing \"to the\r\nrumbling of his chariot-wheels,\" but at this date, ridicule thrown on\r\na man for doing good at odd scraps of a busy day, has a close\r\nsimilarity to the laughter of fools. Let any reader compare the\r\nhealthy gentlemanlike tone of the preface to \"Prince Arthur,\" with the\r\nmean animosity of all the virulent criticisms and sarcasms that were\r\ndirected against the author and his works, and then decide on which\r\nside truth and good taste lie.\r\n\r\nBlackmore made the fatal error of writing too much. His long poems\r\nwearied the patience of those who sympathized with his goodness of\r\nintention. What a list there is of them, in Swift's inscription, \"to\r\nbe put under Sir Richard's picture!\"\r\n\r\n    \"See, who ne'er was, or will be half read,\r\n    Who first sung Arthur, then sung Alfred,[7]\r\n    Praised great Eliza[8] in God's anger,\r\n    Till all true Englishmen cried, hang her!\r\n          .      .      .      .      .\r\n    Then hiss'd from earth, grown heavenly quite,\r\n    Made every reader curse the light.[9]\r\n    Mauled human wit in one thick satire;[10]\r\n    Next, in three books, spoil'd human nature;[11]\r\n    Ended Creation[12] at a jerk,\r\n    And of Redemption[13] made damn'd work:\r\n    Then took his muse at once, and dipp'd her\r\n    Full in the middle of the Scripture.\r\n    What wonders there the man grown old did!\r\n    Sternhold himself he out-sternholded;\r\n    Made David[14] seem so mad and freakish,\r\n    All thought him just what thought king Achish.\r\n    No mortal read his Solomon,[15]\r\n    But judged R'oboam his own son.\r\n    Moses[16] he served, as Moses Pharaoh,\r\n    And Deborah as she Sisera:\r\n    Made Jeremy[17] full sore to cry,\r\n    And Job[18] himself curse God and die.\"\r\n\r\n  [7] Two heroic Poems, folio, twenty books.\r\n\r\n  [8] An heroic Poem, in twelve books.\r\n\r\n  [9] Hymn to Light.\r\n\r\n  [10] Satire against Wit.\r\n\r\n  [11] Of the Nature of Man.\r\n\r\n  [12] Creation, in seven books.\r\n\r\n  [13] Redemption, in six books.\r\n\r\n  [14] Translation of all the Psalms.\r\n\r\n  [15] Canticles and Ecclesiastes.\r\n\r\n  [16] Canticles of Moses, Deborah, &c.\r\n\r\n  [17] The Lamentations.\r\n\r\n  [18] The Whole Book of Job, in folio.\r\n\r\nNor is this by any means a complete list of Sir Richard's works; for\r\nhe was also a voluminous medical writer, and author of a \"History of\r\nthe Conspiracy against the Person and Government of King William the\r\nThird, of glorious memory, in the year 1695.\"\r\n\r\nDryden, unable to clear himself of the charge of pandering for gain to\r\nthe licentious tastes of the age, responded to his accuser by calling\r\nhim an \"ass,\" a \"pedant,\" a \"quack,\" and a \"canting preacher.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Quack Maurus, though he never took degrees\r\n    In either of our universities,\r\n    Yet to be shown by some kind wit he looks,\r\n    Because he play'd the fool, and writ three books.\r\n    But if he would be worth a poet's pen,\r\n    He must be more a fool, and write again;\r\n    For all the former fustian stuff he wrote\r\n    Was dead-born doggerel, or is quite forgot:\r\n    His man of Uz, stript of his Hebrew robe,\r\n    Is just the proverb, and 'as poor as Job.'\r\n    One would have thought he could no longer jog;\r\n    But Arthur was a level, Job's a bog.\r\n    There though he crept, yet still he kept in sight;\r\n    But here he founders in, and sinks downright.\r\n          .      .      .      .      .\r\n    At leisure hours in epic song he deals,\r\n    Writes to the rumbling of his coach's wheels.\r\n          .      .      .      .      .\r\n    Well, let him go--'tis yet too early day\r\n    To get himself a place in farce or play;\r\n    We know not by what name we should arraign him,\r\n    For no one category can contain him.\r\n    A pedant, canting preacher, and a quack,\r\n    Are load enough to break an ass's back.\r\n    At last, grown wanton, he presumed to write,\r\n    Traduced two kings, their kindness to requite;\r\n    One made the doctor, and one dubbed the knight.\"\r\n\r\nThe former of the kings alluded to is James the Second, Blackmore\r\nhaving obtained his fellowship of the College of Physicians, April 12,\r\n1687, under the new charter granted to the college by that monarch;\r\nthe latter being William the Third, who, in recognition of the\r\ndoctor's zeal and influence as a Whig, not less than of his eminence\r\nin his profession, made him a physician of the household, and knighted\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nPope says:--\r\n\r\n    \"The hero William, and the martyr Charles,\r\n    One knighted Blackmore, and one pension'd Quarles.\"\r\n\r\nThe bard of Twickenham had of course a few ill words for Blackmore. In\r\nthe Dunciad he says:--\r\n\r\n    \"Ye critics, in whose heads, as equal scales,\r\n    I weigh what author's heaviness prevails;\r\n    Which most conduce to soothe the soul in slumbers,\r\n    My H----ley's periods, or my Blackmore's numbers.\"\r\n\r\nElsewhere, in the same poem, the little wasp of poetry continues his\r\nhissing song:--\r\n\r\n    \"But far o'er all, sonorous Blackmore's strain,\r\n    Walls, steeples, skies, bray back to him again.\r\n    In Tot'nham fields, the brethren, with amaze,\r\n    Prick all their ears up, and forget to graze;\r\n    'Long Chancery Lane retentive rolls the sound,\r\n    And courts to courts return it round and round;\r\n    Thames wafts it thence to Rufus' roaring hall,\r\n    And Hungerford re-echoes bawl for bawl;\r\n    All hail him victor in both gifts and song,\r\n    Who sings so loudly, and who sings so long.\"\r\n\r\nSuch being the tone of the generals, the reader can imagine that of\r\nthe petty scribblers, the professional libellers, the coffee-house\r\nrakes, and literary amateurs of the Temple, who formed the rabble of\r\nthe vast army against which the doctor had pitted himself, in defence\r\nof public decency and domestic morality. Under the title of\r\n\"Commendatory Verses, on the author of the two Arthurs, and the Satyr\r\nagainst Wit, by some of his particular friends,\" were collected, in\r\nthe year 1700, upwards of forty sets of ribald verses, taunting Sir\r\nRichard with his early poverty, with his having been a school-master,\r\nwith the unspeakable baseness of--living in the city. The writers of\r\nthese wretched dirty lampoons, that no kitchen-maid could in our day\r\nread without blushing, little thought what they were doing. Their\r\nobscene stupidity has secured for them the lasting ignominy to which\r\nthey imagined they were consigning their antagonist. What a crew they\r\nare!--with chivalric Steel and kindly Garth, forgetting their better\r\nnatures, and joining in the miserable riot! To \"The City Quack\"; \"The\r\nCheapside Knight\"; \"The Illustrious Quack, Pedant, Bard\"; \"The Merry\r\nPoetaster of Sadler's Hall\"--such are the titles by which they address\r\nthe doctor, who had presumed to say that authors and men of wit ought\r\nto find a worthier exercise for their intellects than the manufacture\r\nof impure jests.\r\n\r\nColonel Codrington makes his shot thus--\r\n\r\n    \"By Nature meant, by Want a Pedant made,\r\n    Blackmore at first profess'd the whipping trade;\r\n          .      .      .      .      .\r\n    In vain his drugs as well as Birch he try'd--\r\n    His boys grew blockheads, and his patients dy'd.\r\n    Next he turn'd Bard, and, mounted on a cart,\r\n    Whose hideous rumbling made Apollo start,\r\n    Burlesqued the Bravest, Wisest son of Mars,\r\n    In ballad rhymes, and all the pomp of Farce.\r\n          .      .      .      .      .\r\n\r\nThe same dull sarcasms about killing patients and whipping boys into\r\nblockheads are repeated over and over again. As if to show, with the\r\ngreatest possible force, the pitch to which the evil of the times had\r\nrisen, the coarsest and most disgusting of all these lampoon-writers\r\nwas a lady of rank--the Countess of Sandwich. By the side of her\r\nLadyship, Afra Behn and Mistress Manley become timid blushing maidens.\r\nA better defence of Sir Richard than the Countess's attack on him it\r\nwould be impossible to imagine.\r\n\r\nAnd after all--the slander and the maledictions--Sir Richard Blackmore\r\ngained the victory, and the wits who never wearied of calling him \"a\r\nfool\" were defeated. The preface to \"Prince Arthur\" provoked\r\ndiscussion; the good sense and better taste of the country were\r\nroused, and took the reformer's side of the controversy. Pope and his\r\nmyrmidons, it was true, were still able to make the _beau monde_ merry\r\nabout the city knight's presumption--but they could not refute the\r\ncity knight's arguments; and they themselves were compelled to shape\r\ntheir conduct, as writers, in deference to a new public feeling which\r\nhe was an important instrument in calling into existence. \"Prince\r\nArthur\" appeared in 1695, and to the commotion caused by its preface\r\nmay be attributed much of the success of Jeremy Collier's \"Short View\r\nof the Immorality and Profaneness of the Stage,\" which was published\r\nsome three years afterwards.\r\n\r\nAs a poet Sir Richard Blackmore can command only that praise which the\r\ncharitable bestow on goodness of intention. His muse was a pleasant,\r\nwell-looking, right-minded young lady, but nothing more. But it must\r\nbe remembered, before we measure out our criticisms on his\r\nproductions, that he never arrogated to himself the highest honours of\r\npoesy. \"I am a gentleman of taste and culture, and though I cannot\r\never hope to build up the nervous lines of Dryden, or attain the\r\npolish and brilliance of Congreve, I believe I can write what the\r\ngeneration sorely needs--works that intelligent men may study with\r\nimprovement, devout Christians may read without being offended, and\r\npure-minded girls may peruse without blushing from shame. 'Tis true I\r\nam a hard-worked doctor, spending my days in coffee-houses, receiving\r\napothecaries, or driving over the stones in my carriage, visiting my\r\npatients. Of course a man so circumstanced must fail to achieve\r\nartistic excellence, but still I'll do my best.\" Such was the language\r\nwith which he introduced himself to the public.\r\n\r\nHis best poem, _The Creation_, had such merit that his carping\r\nbiographer, Johnson, says, \"This poem, if he had written nothing else,\r\nwould have transmitted him to posterity one of the first favourites of\r\nthe English muse\"; and Addison designated the same poem \"one of the\r\nmost useful and noble productions in our English verse.\"\r\n\r\nOf Sir Richard's private character Johnson remarks--\"In some part of\r\nhis life, it is not known when, his indigence compelled him to teach a\r\nschool--a humiliation with which, though it certainly lasted but a\r\nlittle while, his enemies did not forget to reproach him when he\r\nbecame conspicuous enough to excite malevolence; and let it be\r\nremembered, for his honour, that to have been a schoolmaster is the\r\nonly reproach which all the perspicacity of malice, animated by wit,\r\nhas ever fixed upon his private life.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTHE GENEROSITY AND THE PARSIMONY OF PHYSICIANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the generosity of physicians one _need_ say nothing, for there are\r\nfew who have not experienced or witnessed it; and one _had better_ say\r\nnothing, as no words could do justice to such a subject. This writer\r\ncan speak for at least one poor scholar, to whose sick-bed physicians\r\nhave come from distant quarters of the town, day after day, never\r\ntaking a coin for their precious services, and always in their\r\ngraceful benevolence seeming to find positive enjoyment in their\r\nunpaid labour. In gratitude for kindness shown to himself, and yet\r\nmore for beneficence exhibited to those whom he loves, that man of the\r\ngoose-quill and thumbed books would like to put on record the names of\r\ncertain members of \"the Faculty\" to whom he is so deeply indebted. Ah,\r\ndear Dr. ---- and Dr. ---- and Dr. ----, do not start!--your names\r\nshall not be put down on this cheap common page. Where they are\r\nengraved, you know!\r\n\r\nCynics have been found in plenty to rail at physicians for loving\r\ntheir fees; and one might justly retort on the Cynics, that they love\r\n_nothing but_ their fees. Who doesn't love the sweet money earned by\r\nhis labour--be it labour of hand or brain, or both? One thing is\r\nsure--that doctors are underpaid. The most successful of them in our\r\nown time get far less than their predecessors of any reign, from Harry\r\nthe Eighth downwards. And for honours, though the present age has seen\r\nan author raised to the peerage, no precedent has as yet been\r\nestablished for ennobling eminent physicians and surgeons.\r\n\r\nQueen Elizabeth gave her physician-in-ordinary £100 per annum, besides\r\ndiet, wine, wax, and other perquisites. Her apothecary, Hugo Morgan,\r\nmust too have made a good thing out of her. For a quarter's bill that\r\ngentleman was paid £83 7_s._ 8_d._, a large sum in those days; but\r\nthen it was for such good things. What Queen of England could grudge\r\neleven shillings for \"a confection made like a manus Christi, with\r\nbezoar stone and unicorn's horn\"?--sixteen pence for \"a royal\r\nsweetmeat with incised rhubarb\"?--twelve pence for \"Rosewater for the\r\nKing of Navarre's ambassador\"?--six shillings for \"a conserve of\r\nbarberries, with preserved damascene plums, and other things for Mr.\r\nRaleigh\"?--two shillings and sixpence for \"sweet scent to be used at\r\nthe christening of Sir Richard Knightley's son\"?\r\n\r\nCoytier, the physician of Charles the XI. of France, was better paid\r\nby far. The extent to which he fleeced that monarch is incredible.\r\nFavour after favour he wrung from him. When the royal patient resisted\r\nthe modest demands of his physician, the latter threatened him with\r\nspeedy dissolution. On this menace the king, succumbing to that fear\r\nof death which characterized more than one other of his family, was\r\nsure to make the required concession. Theodore Hook's valet, who was a\r\ngood servant in the first year of his service, a sympathizing friend\r\nin the second, and a hard tyrant in the third, was a timid slave\r\ncompared with Coytier. Charles, in order to be freed from his\r\ndespotism, ordered him to be dispatched. The officer, intrusted with\r\nthe task of carrying out the royal wishes, waited on Coytier, and\r\nsaid, in a most gentlemanlike and considerate manner, \"I am very\r\nsorry, my dear fellow, but I must kill you. The king can't stand you\r\nany longer.\" \"All right,\" said Coytier, with perfect unconcern,\r\n\"whenever you like. What time would it be most convenient for you to\r\nkill me? But still, I am deuced sorry for his Majesty, for I know by\r\noccult science that he can't outlive me more than four days.\" The\r\nofficer was so struck with the announcement, that he went away and\r\nforthwith imparted it to the king. \"Liberate him instantly--don't hurt\r\na hair of his head!\" cried the terrified monarch. And Coytier was once\r\nagain restored to his place in the king's confidence and pocket.\r\n\r\nHenry Atkins managed James the First with some dexterity. Atkins was\r\nsent for to Scotland, to attend Charles the First (then an infant),\r\nwho was dangerously ill of a fever. The king gave him the handsome fee\r\nof £6000. Atkins invested the money in the purchase of the manor of\r\nClapham.\r\n\r\nRadcliffe, with a rare effort of generosity, attended a friend for a\r\ntwelvemonth gratuitously. On making his last visit his friend said,\r\n\"Doctor, here is a purse in which I have put every day's fee; and your\r\ngoodness must not get the better of my gratitude. Take your money.\"\r\nRadcliffe looked, made a resolve to persevere in benevolence, just\r\ntouched the purse to reject it, heard the chink of the gold pieces in\r\nit, and put the bag into his pocket. \"Singly, sir, I could have\r\nrefused them for a twelvemonth; but, all together, _they are\r\nirresistible_,\" said the doctor, walking off with a heavy prize and a\r\nlight heart.\r\n\r\nLouis XIV. gave his physician and his surgeon 75,000 crowns each,\r\nafter successfully undergoing a painful and at that time novel\r\noperation. By the side of such munificence, the fees paid by Napoleon\r\nI. to the Faculty who attended Marie Louise in March, 1811, when the\r\nEmperor's son was born, seem insufficient. Dubois, Corvisart,\r\nBourdier, and Ivan were the professional authorities employed, and\r\nthey had among them a remuneration of £4000, £2000 being the portion\r\nassigned to Dubois.\r\n\r\nEven more than fee gratefully paid does a humorous physician enjoy an\r\nextra fee adroitly drawn from the hand of a reluctant payer. Sir\r\nRichard Jebb was once paid three guineas by a nobleman from whom he\r\nhad a right to expect five. Sir Richard dropped the coins on the\r\ncarpet, when a servant picked them up and restored them--three, and\r\nonly three. Instead of walking off Sir Richard continued his search on\r\nthe carpet. \"Are all the guineas found?\" asked his Lordship looking\r\nround. \"There must be two still on the floor,\" was the answer, \"for I\r\nhave only three.\" The hint of course was taken and the right sum put\r\ndown. An eminent Bristol doctor accomplished a greater feat than this,\r\nand took a fee from--a dead commoner, not a live lord. Coming into his\r\npatient's bed-room immediately after death had taken place, he found\r\nthe right hand of the deceased tightly clenched. Opening the fingers\r\nhe discovered within them a guinea. \"Ah, that was for me--clearly,\"\r\nsaid the doctor putting the piece into his pocket.\r\n\r\nReminding the reader, in its commencement, of Sir Richard Jebb's\r\ndisappointment at the three-guinea fee, the following story may here\r\nbe appropriately inserted. A physician on receiving two guineas, when\r\nhe expected three, from an old lady patient, who was accustomed to\r\ngive him the latter fee, had recourse to one part of Sir Richard's\r\nartifice, and assuming that the third guinea had been dropt through\r\nhis carelessness on the floor, looked about for it. \"Nay, nay,\" said\r\nthe lady with a smile, \"you are not in fault. It is I who dropt it.\"\r\n\r\nThere is an abundance of good stories of physicians fleecing their\r\nlambs. To those that are true the comment may be made--\"Doubtless the\r\nlambs were all the better for being shorn.\" For the following anecdote\r\nwe are indebted to Dr. Moore, the author of \"Zeluco.\" A wealthy\r\ntradesman, after drinking the Bath waters, took a fancy to try the\r\neffect of the Bristol hot wells. Armed with an introduction from a\r\nBath physician to a professional brother at Bristol, the invalid set\r\nout on his journey. On the road he gave way to his curiosity to read\r\nthe doctor's letter of introduction, and cautiously prying into it\r\nread these instructive words: \"Dear sir, the bearer is a fat Wiltshire\r\nclothier--make the most of him.\"\r\n\r\nBenevolence was not a virtue in old Monsey's line; but he could be\r\ngenerous at another's expense, when the enjoyment his malignity\r\nexperienced in paining one person counterbalanced his discomfort at\r\ngiving pleasure to another. Strolling through Oxford market he heard\r\na poor woman ask the price of a piece of meat that lay on a butcher's\r\nstall.\r\n\r\n\"A penny a pound!\" growled the man to whom the question was put,\r\ndisdaining to give a serious answer to such a poverty-stricken\r\ncustomer.\r\n\r\n\"Just weigh that piece of beef, my friend,\" said Monsey, stepping up.\r\n\r\n\"Ten pounds and a half, sir,\" observed the butcher, after adjusting\r\nthe scales and weights.\r\n\r\n\"Here, my good woman,\" said Monsey, \"out with your apron, and put the\r\nbeef into it, and make haste home to your family.\"\r\n\r\nBlessing the benevolent heart of the eccentric old gentleman, the\r\nwoman did as she was bid, took possession of her meat, and was\r\nspeedily out of sight.\r\n\r\n\"And there, my man,\" said Monsey, turning to the butcher, \"is tenpence\r\nhalfpenny, the price of your beef.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" demanded the man.\r\n\r\n\"Simply that that's all I'll pay you. You said the meat was a penny a\r\npound. At that price I bought it of you--to give to the poor woman.\r\nGood morning!\"\r\n\r\nA fee that Dr. Fothergill took of Mr. Grenville was earned without\r\nmuch trouble. Fothergill, like Lettsom, was a Quaker, and was warmly\r\nsupported by his brother sectarians. In the same way Mead was brought\r\ninto practice by the Nonconformists, to whom his father ministered\r\nspiritually. Indeed, Mead's satirists affirmed that when his servant\r\n(acting on instructions) had called him out from divine service, the\r\nparson took his part in the \"dodge\" by asking the congregation to\r\npray for the bodily and ghostly welfare of the patient to whom his son\r\nhad just been summoned. Dissenters are remarkable for giving staunch\r\nsupport, and thorough confidence, to a doctor of their own persuasion.\r\nAt the outbreak of the American war, therefore Grenville knew that he\r\ncould not consult a better authority than the Quaker doctor,\r\nFothergill, on the state of feeling amongst the Quaker colonists.\r\nFothergill was consequently summoned to prescribe for the politician.\r\nThe visit took the form of an animated discussion on American affairs,\r\nwhich was brought to a conclusion by Grenville's putting five guineas\r\ninto the physician's hand, saying--\"Really, doctor, I am so much\r\nbetter, that I don't want you to prescribe for me.\" With a canny\r\nsignificant smile Fothergill, keeping, like a true Quaker, firm hold\r\nof the money, answered, \"At this rate, friend, I will spare thee an\r\nhour now and then.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Glynn, of Cambridge, was as benevolent as he was eccentric. His\r\nreputation in the fen districts as an ague doctor was great, and for\r\nsome years he made a large professional income. On one occasion a poor\r\npeasant woman, the widowed mother of an only son, trudged from the\r\nheart of the fens into Cambridge, to consult the doctor about her boy,\r\nwho was ill of an ague. Her manner so interested the physician, that\r\nthough it was during an inclement winter, and the roads were almost\r\nimpassable to carriages, he ordered horses, and went out to see the\r\nsick lad. After a tedious attendance, and the exhibition of much port\r\nwine and bark (bought at the doctor's expense), the patient recovered,\r\nand Glynn took his leave. A few days after the farewell visit, the\r\npoor woman again presented herself in the consulting room.\r\n\r\n\"I hope, my good woman,\" said Glynn, \"your son is not ill again?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, he was never better,\" answered the woman, gratefully; \"but\r\nwe can't get no rest for thinking of all the trouble that you have\r\nhad, and so my boy resolved this morning on sending you his favourite\r\nmagpie.\"\r\n\r\nIn the woman's hand was a large wicker basket, which she opened at the\r\nconclusion of the speech, affording means of egress to an enormous\r\nmagpie, that hopped out into the room, demure as a saint and bold as a\r\nlord. It was a fee to be proud of!\r\n\r\nThe free-will offerings of the poor to their doctors are sometimes\r\nvery droll, and yet more touching. They are presented with such\r\nfervour and simplicity, and such a sincere anxiety that they should be\r\ntaken as an expression of gratitude for favours past, not for favours\r\nto come. The writer of these pages has known the humble toilers of\r\nagricultural districts retain for a score of years the memory of kind\r\nservices done to them in sickness. He could tell of several who, at\r\nthe anniversary of a particular day (when a wife died, or child was\r\nsaved from fever, or an accident crushed a finger or lacerated a\r\nlimb), trudge for miles over the country to the doctor's house, and\r\nleave there a little present--a pot of honey, a basket of apples, a\r\ndish of the currants from the bush which \"the doctor\" once praised,\r\nand said was fit for a gentleman's garden.\r\n\r\nOf eminent physicians Dr. Gregory of Edinburgh was as remarkable for\r\nhis amiability as for his learning. It was his custom to receive from\r\nnew pupils at his own house the fees for the privilege of attending\r\nhis lectures. Whilst thus engaged one day, he left a student in his\r\nconsulting-room, and went into an adjoining apartment for a fresh\r\nsupply of admission tickets. In a mirror the doctor saw the student\r\nrise from his seat, and sweep into his pocket some guineas from a heap\r\nof gold (the fees of other students) that lay on the consulting-room\r\ntable. Without saying a word at the moment, Dr. Gregory returned,\r\ndated the admission ticket, and gave it to the thief. He then politely\r\nattended him to the door, and on the threshold said to the young man,\r\nwith deep emotion, \"I saw what you did just now. Keep the money. I\r\nknow what distress you must be in. But for God's sake never do it\r\nagain--it can never succeed.\" The pupil implored Gregory to take back\r\nthe money, but the doctor said, \"Your punishment is this, you must\r\nkeep it--now you have taken it.\" The reproof had a salutary effect.\r\nThe youth turned out a good and honest man.\r\n\r\nAn even better anecdote can be told of this good physician's\r\nbenevolence. A poor medical student, ill of typhus fever, sent for\r\nhim. The summons was attended to, and the visit paid, when the invalid\r\nproffered the customary guinea fee. Dr. Gregory turned away, insulted\r\nand angry. \"I beg your pardon, Dr. Gregory,\" exclaimed the student,\r\napologetically, \"I didn't know your rule. Dr. ---- has always taken\r\none.\" \"Oh,\" answered Gregory, \"he has--has he? Look you, then, my\r\nyoung friend; ask him to meet me in consultation, and then offer him a\r\nfee; or stay--offer me the fee first.\" The directions were duly acted\r\nupon. The consultation took place, and the fee was offered. \"Sir,\"\r\nexclaimed the benevolent doctor, \"do you mean to insult me? Is there a\r\nprofessor who would in this University degrade himself so far as to\r\ntake payment from one of his brotherhood--and a junior?\" The confusion\r\nof the man on whom this reproof was really conferred can be imagined.\r\nHe had the decency, ere the day closed, to send back to the student\r\nall the fees he had taken of him.\r\n\r\nAmongst charitable physicians a high place must be assigned to\r\nBrocklesby, of whom mention is made in another part of these pages. An\r\nardent Whig, he was the friend of enthusiastic Tories as well as of\r\nthe members of his own body. Burke on the one hand, and Johnson on the\r\nother, were amongst his intimate associates, and experienced his\r\nbeneficence. To the latter he offered a hundred-a-year for life. And\r\nwhen the Tory writer was struggling with the heavy burden of\r\nincreasing disease, he attended him with affectionate solicitude,\r\ntaking no fee for his services--Dr. Heberden, Dr. Warren, Dr. Butler,\r\nand Mr. Cruikshank the surgeon, displaying a similar liberality. It\r\nwas Brocklesby who endeavored to soothe the mental agitation of the\r\naged scholar's death-bed, by repeating the passage from the Roman\r\nsatirist, in which occurs the line:--\r\n\r\n       \"Fortem posce animum et mortis terrore carentem.\"\r\n\r\nBurke's pun on Brocklesby's name is a good instance of the elaborate\r\ningenuity with which the great Whig orator adorned his conversation\r\nand his speeches. Pre-eminent amongst the advertising quacks of the\r\nday was Dr. Rock. It was therefore natural that Brocklesby should\r\nexpress some surprise at being accosted by Burke as Dr. Rock, a title\r\nat once infamous and ridiculous. \"Don't be offended. Your name is\r\nRock,\" said Burke, with a laugh; \"I'll prove it algebraically:\r\n_Brock--b = Rock_; or, Brock less _b_ makes Rock.\" Dr. Brocklesby, on\r\nthe occasion of giving evidence in a trial, had the ill fortune to\r\noffend the presiding judge, who, amongst other prejudices not uncommon\r\nin the legal profession, cherished a lively contempt for medical\r\nevidence. \"Well, gentlemen of the jury,\" said the noble lawyer in his\r\nsumming up, \"what's the medical testimony? First we have a Dr.\r\nRocklesby or--Brocklesby. What does he say? _First of all he_\r\nswears--_he's a physician_.\"\r\n\r\nAbernethy is a by-word for rudeness and even brutality of manner; but\r\nhe was as tender and generous as a man ought to be, as a man of great\r\nintelligence usually is. The stories current about him are nearly all\r\nfictions of the imagination; or, where they have any foundation in\r\nfact, relate to events that occurred long before the hero to whom they\r\nare tacked by anecdote-mongers had appeared on the stage. He was\r\neccentric--but his eccentricities always took the direction of common\r\nsense; whereas the extravagances attributed to him by popular gossip\r\nare frequently those of a heartless buffoon. His time was precious,\r\nand he rightly considered that his business was to set his patients in\r\nthe way of recovering their lost health--not to listen to their\r\nfatuous prosings about their maladies. He was therefore prompt and\r\ndecided in checking the egotistic garrulity of valetudinarians. This\r\ncandid expression of his dislike to unnecessary talk had one good\r\nresult. People who came to consult him took care not to offend him by\r\nbootless prating. A lady on one occasion entered his consulting-room,\r\nand put before him an injured finger, without saying a word. In\r\nsilence Abernethy dressed the wound, when instantly and silently the\r\nlady put the usual fee on the table, and retired. In a few days she\r\ncalled again, and offered the finger for inspection. \"Better?\" asked\r\nthe surgeon. \"Better,\" answered the lady, speaking to him for the\r\nfirst time. Not another word followed during the rest of the\r\ninterview. Three or four similar visits were made, at the last of\r\nwhich the patient held out her finger free from bandages and perfectly\r\nhealed. \"Well?\" was Abernethy's monosyllabic inquiry. \"Well,\" was the\r\nlady's equally brief answer. \"Upon my soul, madam,\" exclaimed the\r\ndelighted surgeon, \"_you are the most rational woman I ever met\r\nwith_.\"\r\n\r\nTo curb his tongue, however, out of respect to Abernethy's humour, was\r\nan impossibility to John Philpot Curran. Eight times Curran\r\n(personally unknown to Abernethy) had called on the great surgeon; and\r\neight times Abernethy had looked at the orator's tongue (telling him,\r\nby-the-by, that it was the most unclean and utterly abominable tongue\r\nin the world), had curtly advised him to drink less, and not abuse his\r\nstomach with gormandizing, had taken a guinea, and had bowed him out\r\nof the room. On the ninth visit, just as he was about to be dismissed\r\nin the same summary fashion, Curran, with a flash of his dark eye,\r\nfixed the surgeon, and said--\"Mr. Abernethy, I have been here on eight\r\ndifferent days, and I have paid you eight different guineas; but you\r\nhave never yet listened to the symptoms of my complaint. I am\r\nresolved, sir, not to leave the room till you satisfy me by doing\r\nso.\" With a good-natured laugh, Abernethy, half suspecting that he had\r\nto deal with a madman, fell back in his chair and said--\"Oh! very\r\nwell, sir; I am ready to hear you out. Go on, give me the whole--your\r\nbirth, parentage, and education. I wait your pleasure. Pray be as\r\nminute and tedious as you can.\" With perfect gravity Curran\r\nbegan--\"Sir, my name is John Philpot Curran. My parents were poor, but\r\nI believe honest people, of the province of Munster, where also I was\r\nborn, at Newmarket, in the county of Cork, in the year one thousand\r\nseven hundred and fifty. My father being employed to collect the rents\r\nof a Protestant gentleman of small fortune, in that neighbourhood,\r\nprocured my admission into one of the Protestant free-schools, where I\r\nobtained the first rudiments of my education. I was next enabled to\r\nenter Trinity College, Dublin, in the humble sphere of a sizar--\" And\r\nso he went steadily on, till he had thrown his auditor into\r\nconvulsions of laughter.\r\n\r\nAbernethy was very careful not to take fees from patients if he\r\nsuspected them to be in indigent circumstances. Mr. George Macilwain,\r\nin his instructive and agreeable \"Memoirs of John Abernethy,\" mentions\r\na case where an old officer of parsimonious habits, but not of\r\nimpoverished condition, could not induce Abernethy to accept his fee,\r\nand consequently forbore from again consulting him. On another\r\noccasion, when a half-pay lieutenant wished to pay him for a long and\r\nlaborious attendance, Abernethy replied, \"Wait till you're a general;\r\nthen come and see me, and we'll talk about fees.\" To a gentleman of\r\nsmall means who consulted him, after having in vain had recourse to\r\nother surgeons, he said--\"Your recovery will be slow. If you don't\r\nfeel much pain, depend upon it you are gradually getting round; if you\r\ndo feel much pain, then come again, _but not else_. I don't want your\r\nmoney.\" To a hospital student (of great promise and industry, but in\r\nnarrow circumstances), who became his dresser, he returned the\r\ncustomary fee of sixty guineas, and requested him to expend them in\r\nthe purchase of books and securing other means of improvement. To a\r\npoor widow lady (who consulted him about her child), he, on saying\r\ngood-bye in a friendly letter, returned all the fees he had taken from\r\nher under the impression that she was in good circumstances, and added\r\n£50 to the sum, begging her to expend it in giving her child a daily\r\nride in the fresh air. He was often brusque and harsh, and more than\r\nonce was properly reproved for his hastiness and want of\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\"I have heard of your rudeness before I came, sir,\" one lady said,\r\ntaking his prescription, \"but I was not prepared for such treatment.\r\nWhat am I to do with this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Anything you like,\" the surgeon roughly answered. \"Put it on the fire\r\nif you please.\"\r\n\r\nTaking him at his word, the lady put her fee on the table, and the\r\nprescription on the fire; and making a bow, left the room. Abernethy\r\nfollowed her into the hall, apologizing, and begging her to take back\r\nthe fee or let him write another prescription; but the lady would not\r\nyield her vantage-ground.\r\n\r\nOf operations Abernethy had a most un-surgeon-like horror--\"like\r\nCheselden and Hunter, regarding them as the reproach of the\r\nprofession.\" \"I hope, sir, it will not be long,\" said a poor woman,\r\nsuffering under the knife. \"No, indeed,\" earnestly answered Abernethy,\r\n\"that would be too horrible.\" This humanity, on a point on which\r\nsurgeons are popularly regarded as being devoid of feeling, is very\r\ngeneral in the profession. William Cooper (Sir Astley's uncle) was,\r\nlike Abernethy, a most tender-hearted man. He was about to amputate a\r\nman's leg, in the hospital theatre, when the poor fellow, terrified at\r\nthe display of instruments and apparatus, suddenly jumped off the\r\ntable, and hobbled away. The students burst out laughing; and the\r\nsurgeon, much pleased at being excused from the performance of a\r\npainful duty, exclaimed, \"By God, I am glad he's gone!\"\r\n\r\nThe treatment which one poor fellow received from Abernethy may at\r\nfirst sight seem to militate against our high estimate of the\r\nsurgeon's humanity, and dislike of inflicting physical pain. Dr. ----,\r\nan eminent physician still living and conferring lustre on his\r\nprofession, sent a favourite man-servant with a brief note,\r\nrunning--\"Dear Abernethy, Will you do me the kindness to put a seton\r\nin this poor fellow's neck? Yours sincerely, ----.\" The man, who was\r\naccustomed and encouraged to indulge in considerable freedom of speech\r\nwith his master's friends, not only delivered the note to Abernethy,\r\nbut added, in an explanatory and confiding tone, \"You see, sir, I\r\ndon't get better, and as master thinks I ought to have a seton in my\r\nneck, I should be thankful if you'd put it in for me.\" It is not at\r\nall improbable that Abernethy resented the directions of master and\r\nman. Anyhow he inquired into the invalid's case, and then taking out\r\nhis needles did as he was requested. The operation was attended with a\r\nlittle pain, and the man howled, as only a coward can howl, under the\r\ntemporary inconvenience. \"Oh! Lor' bless you! Oh, have mercy on me!\r\nYarra--yarra--yarr! Oh, doctor--doctor--you'll kill me!\" In another\r\nminute the surgeon's work was accomplished, and the acute pain having\r\npassed away, the man recovered his self-possession and impudence.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, well, sir, I do hope, now that it's done, it'll do me good. I do\r\nhope that.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it won't do you a bit of good.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, sir, no good?\" cried the fellow.\r\n\r\n\"No more good,\" replied Abernethy, \"than if I had spat upon it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, sir--why--oh, yarr! here's the pain again--why did you do it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Confound you, man!\" answered the surgeon testily. \"Why did I do\r\nit?--why, _didn't you ask me to put a seton in your neck_?\"\r\n\r\nOf course the surgical treatment employed by Abernethy in this case\r\nwas the right one; but he was so nettled with the fellow's impudence\r\nand unmanly lamentations, that he could not forbear playing off upon\r\nhim a barbarous jest.\r\n\r\nIf for this outbreak of vindictive humour the reader is inclined to\r\ncall Abernethy a savage, let his gift of £50 to the widow lady, to pay\r\nfor her sick child's carriage exercise, be remembered. _Apropos_ of\r\n£50, Dr. Wilson of Bath sent a present of that sum to an indigent\r\nclergyman, against whom he had come in the course of practice. The\r\ngentleman who had engaged to convey the gift to the unfortunate\r\npriest said, \"Well, then, I'll take the money to him to-morrow.\" \"Oh,\r\nmy dear sir,\" said the doctor, \"take it to him to-night. Only think of\r\nthe importance to a sick man of one good night's rest!\"\r\n\r\nSide by side with stories of the benevolence of \"the Faculty,\" piquant\r\nanecdotes of their stinginess might be told. This writer knew formerly\r\na grab-all-you-can-get surgeon, who was entertaining a few\r\nprofessional brethren at a Sunday morning's breakfast, when a patient\r\nwas ushered into the ante-room of the surgeon's bachelor chambers, and\r\nthe surgeon himself was called away to the visitor. Unfortunately he\r\nleft the folding-doors between the breakfast-room and the ante-room\r\najar, and his friends sitting in the former apartment overheard the\r\nfollowing conversation:\r\n\r\n\"Well, my friend, what's the matter?\"--the surgeon's voice.\r\n\r\nThe visitor's voice--\"Plaze, yer honner, I'm a pore Hirish labourer,\r\nbut I can spill a bit, and I read o' yer honner's moighty foine cure\r\nin the midical jarnal--the _Lancet_. And I've walked up twilve miles\r\nto have yer honner cure me. My complaint is ----\"\r\n\r\nSurgeon's voice, contemptuously--\"Oh, my good man, you've made a\r\nmistake. You'd better go to the druggist's shop nearest your home, and\r\nhe'll do for you all you want. You couldn't pay me as I require to be\r\npaid.\"\r\n\r\nVisitor's voice, proudly and triumphantly--\"Och, an' little ye know an\r\nIrish gintleman, dochter, if ye think he'd be beholden to the best of\r\nyou for a feavor. Here's a bit o' gould--nocht liss nor a tin shillin'\r\npiece, but I've saved it up for ye, and ye'll heve the whole, tho' its\r\nevery blissed farthing I hev.\"\r\n\r\nThe surgeon's voice altered. The case was gone into. The prescription\r\nwas written. The poor Irish drudge rose to go, when the surgeon, with\r\nthat delicate quantity of conscience that rogues always have to make\r\nthemselves comfortable upon, said, \"Now, you say you have no more\r\nmoney, my friend. Well, the druggist will charge you eighteenpence for\r\nthe medicine I have ordered there. So there's eighteenpence for you\r\nout of your half-sovereign.\"\r\n\r\nWe may add that this surgeon was then, at a moderate computation,\r\nmaking three thousand a year. We have heard of an Old Bailey barrister\r\nboasting how he wrung the shillings (to convert the sovereigns already\r\npaid with his brief into guineas) from the grimed hands of a prisoner\r\nactually standing in the dock for trial, ere he would engage to defend\r\nhim. But compared with this surgeon the man of the long robe was a\r\ndisinterested friend of the oppressed.\r\n\r\nA better story yet of a surgeon who seized on his fee like a hawk. A\r\nclergyman of ----shire, fell from a branch of a high pear-tree to the\r\ngrass-plot of the little garden that surrounded his vicarage-house,\r\nand sustained, besides being stunned, a compound fracture of the right\r\narm. His wife, a young and lovely creature, of a noble but poor\r\nfamily, to whom he had been married only three or four years, was\r\nterribly alarmed, and without regulating her conduct by considerations\r\nof her pecuniary means, dispatched a telegraphic message to an eminent\r\nLondon surgeon. In the course of three or four hours the surgeon made\r\nhis appearance, and set the broken limb.\r\n\r\n\"And what, sir,\" the young wife timidly asked of the surgeon, when he\r\nhad come down-stairs into her little drawing-room, \"is your fee?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, let's see--distance from town, hundred miles. Yes. Then my fee is\r\na hundred guineas!\"\r\n\r\nTurning deadly pale with fright (for the sum was ten times the highest\r\namount the poor girl had thought of as a likely fee) she rose, and\r\nleft the room, saying, \"Will you be kind enough to wait for a few\r\nminutes?\"\r\n\r\nLuckily her brother (like her husband, a clergyman, with very moderate\r\npreferment) was in the house, and he soon made his appearance in the\r\ndrawing-room. \"Sir,\" said he, addressing the operator, \"my sister has\r\njust now been telling me the embarrassment she is in, and I think it\r\nbest to repeat her story frankly. She is quite inexperienced in money\r\nmatters, and sent for you without ever asking what the ordinary fee to\r\nso distinguished a surgeon as yourself, for coming so far from London,\r\nmight be. Well, sir, it is right you should know her circumstances. My\r\nbrother-in-law has no property but his small living, which does not\r\nyield him more than £400 per annum, and he has already two children.\r\nMy sister has no private fortune whatever, at present, and all she has\r\nin prospect is the reversion of a trifling sum--at a distant period.\r\nPoverty is the only stigma that time has fixed upon my family. Now,\r\nsir, under the circumstances, if professional etiquette would allow of\r\nyour reducing your fee to the straitened finances of my sister, it\r\nreally would--would be--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my dear sir,\" returned the surgeon, in a rich, unctuous voice of\r\nbenevolence, \"pray don't think I'm a shark. I am really deeply\r\nconcerned for your poor sister. As for my demand of _a hundred\r\nguineas_, since it would be beyond her means to satisfy it, why, my\r\ndear sir, I shall be only too delighted to be allowed--_to take a\r\nhundred pounds_!\"\r\n\r\nThe fee-loving propensities of doctors are well illustrated by the\r\nadmirable touches of Froissart's notice of Guyllyam of Harseley, who\r\nwas appointed physician to Charles the Sixth, King of France, during\r\nhis derangement. The writer's attention was first called to\r\nFriossart's sketch of the renowned mad-doctor by his friend Mr.\r\nEdgar--a gentleman whose valuable contributions to historical\r\nliterature have endeared his name to both young and old. Of the\r\nmeasures adopted by Guyllyam for the king's cure the readers of\r\nFroissart are not particularly informed; but it would appear, from the\r\nphysician's parting address to the \"dukes of Orlyance, Berrey,\r\nBurgoyne, and Burbone,\" that his system was, in its enlightened\r\nhumanity, not far behind that adopted at the present day by Dr.\r\nConolly and Dr. Forbes Winslow. But, however this may be, Guyllyam's\r\nlabours must be regarded as not less consonant with sound nosological\r\nviews than those of the afflicted monarch's courtiers, until it can be\r\nshown that his treatment was worse than leaving Nature to herself.\r\n\"They,\" says Froissart, \"that were about the kynge sente the kynge's\r\noffrynge to a town called Aresneche, in the countie of Heynaulte,\r\nbetween Cambrey and Valancennes, in the whiche towne there was a\r\nchurche parteyning to an Abbey of Saynt Waste in Arrasce wherein there\r\nlyeth a saynte, called Saynt Acquayre, of whom there is a shrine of\r\nsylver, which pylgrimage is sought farre and nere for the malady of\r\nthe fransey; thyder was sent a man of waxe, representynge the Frenche\r\nKynge, and was humbly offred to the Saynt, that he might be meane to\r\nGod, to asswage the kynge's malady, and to sende him helthe. In\r\nlykewise the kynge's offrynge was sent to Saynt Hermyer in Romayes,\r\nwhich saynt had meryte to heal the fransey. And in lykewise offrynges\r\nwere sent into other places for ye same entent.\"\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of Guyllyam's attendance is thus described:--\"Trewe it\r\nis this sycknesse that the kyng took in the voyage towards Bretagne\r\ngreatly abated the ioye of the realme of France, and good cause why,\r\nfor when the heed is sicke the body canne have no ioye. No man durste\r\nopenly speke thereof, but kepte it privy as moche as might be, and it\r\nwas couertly kept fro the queene, for tyll she was delyuered and\r\nchurched she knewe nothynge thereof, which tyme she had a doughter.\r\nThe physician, myster Guyllyam, who had the chefe charge of healynge\r\nof the kynge, was styll aboute hym, and was ryght dyligent and well\r\nacquyted hymselfe, whereby he gate bothe honour and profyte; for\r\nlytell and lytell he brought the kynge in good estate, and toke away\r\nthe feuer and the heate, and made hym to haue taste and appetyte to\r\neate and drinke, slepe and rest, and knowledge of every thynge;\r\nhowebeit, he was very feble, and lytell and lytell he made the kynge\r\nto ryde a huntynge and on hawkynge; and whanne tydynges was knowen\r\nthrough France howe the kynge was well mended, and had his memory\r\nagain, every man was ioyfull and thanked God. The kynge thus beyng at\r\nCrayell, desyred to se the quene his wyfe and the dolphyn his sonne;\r\nso the quene came thyder to hym, and the chylde was brought thyder,\r\nthe kynge made them good chere, and so lytell and lytell, through the\r\nhelpe of God, the kynge recouered his helthe. And when mayster\r\nGuyllyam sawe the kynge in so good case he was ryght ioyfull, as\r\nreasone was, for he hade done a fayre cure, and so delyuered him to\r\nthe dukes of Orlyance, Berrey, Burgoyne, and Burbone, and sayd: 'My\r\nlordes, thanked be God, the kynge is nowe in good state and helth, so\r\nI delyuer him, but beware lette no mane dysplease hym, for as yet his\r\nspyrytes be no fully ferme nor stable, but lytell and lytell he shall\r\nwaxe stronge; reasonable dysporte, rest, and myrthe shall be moste\r\nprofytable for hym; and trouble hym as lytell as may be with any\r\ncounsayles, for he hath been sharpely handeled with a hote malady.'\r\nThan it was consydred to retaygne this mayster Guyllyam, and to gyve\r\nhym that he shulde be content with all, _whiche is the ende that all\r\nphysicians requyre, to haue gyftes and rewardes_; he was desyred to\r\nabyde styll about the kynge, but he excused hymselfe, and sayd howe he\r\nwas an olde impotent man, and coulde note endure the maner of courte,\r\nwherfore he desyred to returne into his owne countrey. Whan the\r\ncounsayle sawe he wolde none otherwyse do, they gaue him leaue, and at\r\nhis departing _gave him a thousand crownes, and retayned hym in wages\r\nwith four horses whansover he wolde resorte to the courte_; howbeit, I\r\nbeleve he never came there after, for whan he retournd to the cytie of\r\nLaon, there he contynued and dyed a ryche man: he left behynde him a\r\nxxx thousand frankes. All his dayes he was one of the greatest\r\nnygardes that ever was: all his pleasure was to get good and to spende\r\nnothynge, for in his howse he neuer spente past two souses of Parys\r\nin a day, but wolde eate and drinke in other mennes howses, where as\r\nhe myght get it. _With this rodde lyghtly all physicyons are\r\nbeaten._\"[19]\r\n\r\n  [19] Froissart's Chronicles, translated by John Bouchier, Lord\r\n  Berners.\r\n\r\nThe humane advice given by Guyllym countenances the tradition that\r\ncards were invented for the amusement of his royal patient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nBLEEDING.\r\n\r\n\r\nFashion, capricious everywhere, is especially so in surgery and\r\nmedicine. Smoking we are now taught to regard as a pernicious\r\npractice, to be abhorred as James the First abhorred it. Yet Dr.\r\nArcher, and Dr. Everard in his \"Panacea, or a Universal Medicine,\r\nbeing a discovery of the wonderful virtues of Tobacco\" (1659), warmly\r\ndefended the habit, and for long it was held by the highest\r\nauthorities to be an efficacious preservative against disease. What\r\nwould schoolboys now say to being flogged for _not_ smoking? Yet\r\nThomas Hearne, in his diary (1720-21) writes--\"Jan. 21, I have been\r\ntold that in the last great plague in London none that kept\r\ntobacconists' shops had the plague. It is certain that smoking was\r\nlooked upon as a most excellent preservative. In so much, that even\r\nchildren were obliged to smoak. And I remember that I heard formerly\r\nTom Rogers, who was yeoman beadle, say, that when he was that year,\r\nwhen the plague raged, a school-boy at Eton, all the boys of that\r\nschool were obliged to smoak in the school every morning, and that he\r\nwas never whipped so much in his life as he was one morning for not\r\nsmoaking.\"\r\n\r\nBlood-letting, so long a popular remedy with physicians, has, like\r\ntobacco-smoking for medicinal purposes, fallen into disuse and\r\ncontempt. From Hippocrates to Paracelsus, who, with characteristic\r\ndaring, raised some objections to the practice of venesection, doctors\r\nwere in the habit of drawing disease from the body as vintners extract\r\nclaret from a cask, in a ruddy stream. In the feudal ages bleeding was\r\nin high favour. Most of the abbeys had a \"flebotomaria\" or\r\n\"bleeding-house,\" in which the sacred inmates underwent bleedings (or\r\n\"minutions\" as they were termed) at stated periods of the year, to the\r\nstrains of psalmody. The brethren of the order of St. Victor underwent\r\nfive munitions annually--in September, before Advent, before Lent,\r\nafter Easter, and at Pentecost.\r\n\r\nThere is a good general view of the superstitions and customs\r\nconnected with venesection, in \"The Salerne Schoole,\" a poem of which\r\nmention continually occurs in the writings of our old physicians. The\r\npoem commences with the following stanza:--\r\n\r\n    \"The 'Salerne Schoole' doth by these lines impart\r\n      All health to England's king, and doth advise\r\n    From care his head to keepe, from wrath his hart.\r\n      Drink not much wine, sup light and soon arise,\r\n    When meat is gone long sitting breedeth smart;\r\n      And afternoon still waking keep your eies.\r\n          .      .      .      .      .\r\n    Use three physicians still--first Doctor _Quiet_,\r\n    Next Doctor _Merriman_ and Doctor _Dyet_.\r\n\r\n    \"Of bleeding many profits grow and great\r\n      The spirits and sences are renew'd thereby,\r\n    Thogh these mend slowly by the strength of meate,\r\n      But these with wine restor'd are by-and-by;\r\n    By bleeding to the marrow commeth heate,\r\n      It maketh cleane your braine, releeves your eie,\r\n    It mends your appetite, restoreth sleepe,\r\n    Correcting humors that do waking keep:\r\n    All inward parts and sences also clearing,\r\n    It mends the voice, touch, smell, and taste, and hearing.\r\n\r\n    \"_Three special months_, _September_, _Aprill_, _May_,\r\n      There are in which 'tis good to ope a vein--\r\n    In these three months the moon beares greatest sway,\r\n      Then old or young, that store of blood containe,\r\n    May bleed now, though some elder wizards say,\r\n      Some daies are ill in these, I hold it vaine;\r\n    September, Aprill, May have daies apeece,\r\n    That bleeding do forbid and eating geese,\r\n    And those are they, forsooth, of May the first,\r\n    Of t'other two, the last of each are worst.\r\n\r\n    \"But yet those daies I graunt, and all the rest,\r\n      Haue in some cases just impediment,\r\n    As first, if nature be with cold opprest,\r\n      Or if the Region, Ile, or Continent,\r\n    Do scorch or freez, if stomach meat detest,\r\n      If Baths you lately did frequent,\r\n    Nor old, nor young, nor drinkers great are fit,\r\n    Nor in long sickness, nor in raging fit,\r\n    Or in this case, if you will venture bleeding,\r\n    The quantity must then be most exceeding.\r\n\r\n    \"When you to bleed intend, you must prepare\r\n      Some needful things both after and before:\r\n    Warm water and sweet oyle both needfull are,\r\n      And wine the fainting spirits to restore;\r\n    Fine binding cloths of linnen, and beware\r\n      That all the morning you do sleepe no more;\r\n    Some gentle motion helpeth after bleeding,\r\n    And on light meals a spare and temperate feeding\r\n    To bleed doth cheare the pensive, and remove\r\n    The raging furies bred by burning love.\r\n\r\n    \"Make your incision large and not too deep,\r\n      That blood have speedy yssue with the fume;\r\n    So that from sinnews you all hurt do keep.\r\n      Nor may you (as I toucht before) presume\r\n    In six ensuing houres at all to sleep,\r\n      Lest some slight bruise in sleepe cause an apostume;\r\n    Eat not of milke, or aught of milke compounded,\r\n    Nor let your brain with much drinke be confounded;\r\n    Eat no cold meats, for such the strength impayre,\r\n    And shun all misty and unwholesome ayre.\r\n\r\n    \"Besides the former rules for such as pleases\r\n      Of letting bloud to take more observation;\r\n          .      .      .      .      .\r\n    To old, to young, both letting blood displeases.\r\n      By yeares and sickness make your computation.\r\n    First in the spring for quantity you shall\r\n    Of bloud take twice as much as in the fall;\r\n    In spring and summer let the right arme bloud,\r\n    The fall and winter for the left are good.\"\r\n\r\nWadd mentions an old surgical writer who divides his chapter on\r\nbleeding under such heads as the following:--1. What is to limit\r\nbleeding? 2. Qualities of an able phlebotomist; 3. Of the choice of\r\ninstruments; 4. Of the band and bolster; 5. Of porringers; 6.\r\n_Circumstances to be considered at the bleeding of a Prince._\r\n\r\nSimon Harward's \"Phlebotomy, or Treatise of Letting of Bloud; fitly\r\nserving, as well for an advertisement and remembrance to all\r\nwell-minded chirurgians, as well also to give a caveat generally to\r\nall men to beware of the manifold dangers which may ensue upon rash\r\nand unadvised letting of bloud,\" published in the year 1601, contains\r\nmuch interesting matter on the subject of which it treats. But a yet\r\nmore amusing work is one that Nicholas Gyer wrote and published in\r\n1592, under the following title:--\r\n\r\n\"The English Phlebotomy; or, Method and Way of Healing by Letting of\r\nBloud.\"\r\n\r\nOn the title-page is a motto taken from the book of Proverbs--\"The\r\nhorse-leach hath two daughters, which crye, 'give, give.'\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _THE FOUNDERS OF THE MEDICAL SOCIETY OF LONDON_]\r\n\r\nThe work affords some valuable insight into the social status of the\r\nprofession in the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nIn his dedicatory letter to Master Reginald Scot, Esquire, the author\r\nsays that phlebotomy \"is greatly abused by vagabund horse-leaches\r\nand travailing tinkers, who find work almost in every village through\r\nwhom it comes (having in truth neither knowledge, nor witte, nor\r\nhonesty), the sober practitioner and cunning chirurgian liveth basely,\r\nis despised, and accounted a very abject amongst the vulgar sort.\" Of\r\nthe medical skill of Sir Thomas Eliot, and Drs. Bulleyn, Turner,\r\nPenié, and Coldwel, the author speaks in terms of warm eulogy; but as\r\nfor the tinkers aforementioned, he would regard them as murderers, and\r\n\"truss them up at Tyborne.\"\r\n\r\nGyer, who indulges in continual reference to the \"Schola Salerni,\"\r\nmakes the following contribution to the printed metrical literature on\r\nVenesection:--\r\n\r\n     \"_Certaine very old English verses, concerning the veines\r\n     and letting of bloud, taken out of a very auncient paper\r\n     book of Phisicke  notes_:--\r\n\r\n    \"Ye maisters that usen bloud-letting,\r\n    And therewith getten your living;\r\n    Here may you learn wisdome good,\r\n    In what place ye shall let bloud.\r\n    For man, in woman, or in child,\r\n    For evils that he wood and wild.\r\n    There beene veynes thirty-and-two,\r\n    For wile is many, that must he undo.\r\n    Sixteene in the head full right,\r\n    And sixteene beneath I you plight.\r\n    In what place they shall be found,\r\n    I shall you tell in what stound.\r\n    Beside the eares there beene two,\r\n    That on a child mote beene undoe;\r\n    To keep his head from evil turning\r\n    And from the scale withouten letting.\r\n    And two at the temples must bleede,\r\n    For stopping and aking I reede;\r\n    And one is in the mid forehead,\r\n    For Lepry or for sawcefleme that mote bleede.\r\n    Above the nose forsooth is one,\r\n    That for the frensie mote be undone.\r\n    Also when the eien been sore,\r\n    For the red gowt evermore.\r\n    And two other be at the eien end.\r\n    If thy bleeden them to amend.\r\n    And the arch that comes thorow smoking,\r\n    I you tell withouten leasing.\r\n    And at the whole of the throat, there beene two,\r\n    That Lepry and straight breath will undoo.\r\n    In the lips foure there beene,\r\n    Able to bleede I tell it be deene,\r\n    Two beneath, and above also\r\n    I tell thee there beene two.\r\n    For soreness of the mouth to bleede,\r\n    When it is flawne as I thee reede.\r\n    And two in the tongue withouten lie,\r\n    Mote bleede for the quinancie.\r\n    And when the tongue is aught aking,\r\n    For all manner of swelling.\r\n    Now have I tolde of certaine,\r\n    That longer for the head I weene,\r\n    And of as many I will say,\r\n    That else where there beene in fay.\r\n    In every arme there beene fife,\r\n    Full good to blede for man and wife,\r\n    _Cephalica_ is one I wis,\r\n    The head veyne he cleaped is,\r\n    The body above and the head;\r\n    He cleanseth for evil and qued.\r\n    In the bought of the arme also,\r\n    An order there must he undoo;\r\n    Basilica his name is,\r\n    Lowest he sitteth there y wis;\r\n    Forsooth he cleanseth the liver aright,\r\n    And all other members beneath I twight.\r\n    The middle is between the two,\r\n    Corall he is clipped also\r\n    That veine cleanseth withouten doubt;\r\n    Above and beneath, within and without.\r\n    For Basilica that I of told,\r\n    One braunched veine ety up full bold,\r\n    To the thomb goeth that one braunch;\r\n    The cardiacle he wil staunch,\r\n    That there braunch full right goeth,\r\n    To the little finger withouten oth;\r\n    _Saluatell_ is his name,\r\n    He is a veine of noble fame;\r\n    There is no veine that cleanseth so clene,\r\n    The stopping of the liver and splene.\r\n    Above the knuckles of the feet,\r\n    With two veines may thou meet,\r\n    Within sitteth _Domestica_,\r\n    And without _Saluatica_.\r\n          .      .      .      .      .\r\n    All the veines thee have I told,\r\n    That cleanseth man both yong and old.\r\n    If thou use them at thy need,\r\n    These foresaid evils they dare not dread;\r\n    So that our Lord be them helping,\r\n    That all hath in his governing.\r\n    So mote it be, so say all wee,\r\n    Amen, amen, for charitee.\"\r\n\r\nTo bleed on May-day is still the custom with ignorant people in a few\r\nremote districts. The system of vernal minutions probably arose from\r\nthat tendency in most men to repeat an act (simply because they have\r\ndone it once) until it has become a habit, and then superstitiously to\r\npersevere in the habit, simply because it is a habit. How many aged\r\npeople read certain antiquated journals, as they wear exploded\r\ngarments, for no other reason than that they read the same sort of\r\nliterature, and wore the same sort of habiliments, when young. To miss\r\nfor once the performance of a periodically recurring duty, and so to\r\nbreak a series of achievements, would worry many persons, as the\r\nintermitted post caused Dr. Johnson discomfort till he had returned\r\nand touched it. As early as the sixteenth century, we have Gyer\r\ncombating the folly of people having recourse to periodic\r\nvenesections. \"There cometh to my minde,\" he says, \"a common opinion\r\namong the ignorant people, which do certainly beleeve that, if any\r\nperson be let bloud one yere, he must be let bloud every yere, or else\r\nhe is (I cannot tell, nor they neither) in how great danger. Which\r\nfonde opinion of theirs, whereof soever the same sprong first, it is\r\nno more like to be true, than if I should say: when a man hath\r\nreceived a great wound by chaunce in any part of his body, whereby he\r\nloseth much bloud; yet after it is healed, he must needs have the like\r\nwounde againe there the next yeare, to avoid as much bloud, or els he\r\nis in daunger of great sickness, yea, and also in hazard to lose his\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\nThe practitioners of phlebotomy, and the fees paid for the operation,\r\nhave differed widely. In the middle of the last century a woman used\r\nthe lancet with great benefit to her own pocket, if not to her\r\npatients, in Marshland, in the county of Norfolk. What her charge was\r\nis unknown, probably, however, only a few pence. A distinguished\r\npersonage of the same period (Lord Radnor) had a great fondness for\r\nletting the blood (at the point of an amicable lancet--not a hostile\r\nsword) of his friends. But his Lordship, far from accepting a fee, was\r\nwilling to remunerate those who had the courage to submit to his\r\nsurgical care. Lord Chesterfield, wanting an additional vote for a\r\ncoming division in the House of Peers, called on Lord Radnor, and,\r\nafter a little introductory conversation, complained of a distressing\r\nheadache.\r\n\r\n\"You ought to lose blood then,\" said Lord Radnor.\r\n\r\n\"Gad--do you indeed think so? Then, my dear lord, do add to the\r\nservice of your advice by performing the operation. I know you are a\r\nmost skilful surgeon.\"\r\n\r\nDelighted at the compliment, Lord Radnor in a trice pulled out his\r\nlancet-case, and opened a vein in his friend's arm.\r\n\r\n\"By-the-by,\" asked the patient, as his arm was being adroitly bound\r\nup, \"do you go down to the House to-day?\"\r\n\r\n\"I had not intended going,\" answered the noble operator, \"not being\r\nsufficiently informed on the question which is to be debated; but you,\r\nthat have considered it, which side will you vote on?\"\r\n\r\nIn reply, Lord Chesterfield unfolded his view of the case; and Lord\r\nRadnor was so delighted with the reasoning of the man (who held his\r\nsurgical powers in such high estimation), that he forthwith promised\r\nto support the wily earl's side in the division.\r\n\r\n\"I have shed my blood for the good of my country,\" said Lord\r\nChesterfield that evening to a party of friends, who, on hearing the\r\nstory, were convulsed with laughter.\r\n\r\nSteele tells of a phlebotomist who advertised, for the good of\r\nmankind, to bleed at \"threepence per head.\" Trade competition has,\r\nhowever, induced practitioners to perform the operation even without\r\n\"the threepence.\" In the _Stamford Mercury_ for March 28, 1716, the\r\nfollowing announcement was made:--\"Whereas the majority of\r\napothecaries in Boston have agreed to pull down the price of bleeding\r\nto sixpence, let these certifie that Mr Clarke, apothecary, will bleed\r\nanybody at his shop _gratis_.\"\r\n\r\nThe readers of Smollett may remember in one of his novels the story of\r\na gentleman, who, falling down in his club in an apoplectic fit, was\r\nimmediately made the subject of a bet between two friendly bystanders.\r\nThe odds were given and accepted against the sick man's recovery, and\r\nthe wager was duly registered, when a suggestion was made by a more\r\nhumane spectator that a surgeon ought to be sent for. \"Stay,\"\r\nexclaimed the good fellow interested in having a fatal result to the\r\nattack, \"if he is let blood, or interfered with in any way, the bet\r\ndoesn't hold good.\" This humorous anecdote may be found related as an\r\nactual occurrence in Horace Walpole's works. It was doubtless one of\r\nthe \"good stories\" current in society, and was so completely public\r\nproperty, that the novelist deemed himself entitled to use it as he\r\nliked. In certain recent books of \"ana\" the incident is fixed on\r\nSheridan and the Prince Regent, who are represented as the parties to\r\nthe bet.\r\n\r\nElsewhere mention has been made of a thousand pounds _ordered_ to be\r\npaid Sir Edmund King for promptly bleeding Charles the Second. A\r\nnobler fee was given by a French lady to a surgeon, who used his\r\nlancet so clumsily that he cut an artery instead of a vein, in\r\nconsequence of which the lady died. On her death-bed she, with\r\ncharming humanity and irony, made a will, bequeathing the operator a\r\nlife annuity of eight hundred livres, on condition \"that he never\r\nagain bled anybody so long as he lived.\" In the _Journal\r\nEncylopédique_ of Jan. 15, 1773, a somewhat similar story is told of a\r\nPolish princess, who lost her life in the same way. In her will, made\r\n_in extremis_, there was the following clause:--\"Convinced of the\r\ninjury that my unfortunate accident will occasion to the unhappy\r\nsurgeon who is the cause of my death, I bequeath to him a life annuity\r\nof two hundred ducats, secured by my estate, and forgive his mistake\r\nfrom my heart: I wish this may indemnify him for the discredit which\r\nmy sorrowful catastrophe will bring upon him.\"\r\n\r\nA famous French Maréchal reproved the clumsiness of a phlebotomist in\r\na less gratifying manner. Drawing himself away from the bungling\r\noperator, just as the incision was about to be made, he displayed an\r\nunwillingness to put himself further in the power of a practitioner,\r\nwho, in affixing the fillet, had given him a blow with the elbow in\r\nthe face.\r\n\r\n\"My Lord,\" said the surgeon, \"it seems that you are afraid of the\r\nbleeding.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" returned the Maréchal, \"not of the bleeding--but the bleeder.\"\r\n\r\nMonsieur, brother of Louis XIV., had an insuperable aversion to the\r\noperation, however dexterous might be the operator. At Marly, while at\r\ntable with the King, he was visited with such ominous symptoms, that\r\nFochon, the first physician of the court, said--\"You are threatened\r\nwith apoplexy, and you cannot be too soon blooded.\"\r\n\r\nBut the advice was not acted on, though the King entreated that it\r\nmight be complied with.\r\n\r\n\"You will find,\" said Louis, \"what your obstinacy will cost you. We\r\nshall be awoke some of these nights to be told that you are dead.\"\r\n\r\nThe royal prediction, though not fulfilled to the letter, soon proved\r\nsubstantially true. After a gay supper at St. Cloud, Monsieur, just as\r\nhe was about to retire to bed, quitted the world. He was asking M. de\r\nVentadour for a glass of liqueur sent him by the Duke of Savoy, when\r\nhe dropped down dead. Anyhow Monsieur went out of this life thinking\r\nof something nice. The Marquis of Hertford, with all his\r\ndeliberation, could not do more.\r\n\r\nThe excess to which the practice of venesection was carried in the\r\nlast century is almost beyond belief. The _Mercure de France_ (April,\r\n1728, and December, 1729) gives the particulars of the illness of a\r\nwoman named Gignault. She was aged 24 years, was the wife of an\r\nhussar, and resided at St. Sauge, a town of the Nivernois. Under the\r\ndirection of Monsieur Theveneau, Seigneur de Palmery, M.D., of St.\r\nSauge, she was bled three thousand nine hundred and four times in nine\r\nmonths (_i. e._ from the 6th of September, 1726, to the 3rd of June,\r\n1727). By the 15th of July, in the same year, the bleedings numbered\r\nfour thousand five hundred and fifty-five. From the 6th of September,\r\n1726, to the 1st of December, 1729, the blood-lettings amounted to\r\ntwenty-six thousand two hundred and thirty. Did this really occur? Or\r\nwas the editor of the _Mercure de France_ the original Baron\r\nMunchausen?\r\n\r\nSuch an account as the above ranges us on the side of the German\r\nphysician, who petitioned that the use of the lancet might be made\r\npenal. Garth's epigram runs:--\r\n\r\n    \"Like a pert skuller, one physician plies,\r\n    And all his art and all his skill he tries;\r\n    But two physicians, like a pair of oars,\r\n    Conduct you faster to the Stygian shores.\"\r\n\r\nIt would, however, be difficult to imagine a quicker method to destroy\r\nhuman life than that pursued by Monsieur Theveneau. A second adviser\r\ncould hardly have accelerated his movements, or increased his\r\ndetermination not to leave his reduced patient a chance of recovery.\r\n\r\n\"A rascal,\" exclaimed a stout, asthmatic old gentleman, to a\r\nwell-dressed stranger on Holborn Hill--\"a rascal has stolen my hat. I\r\ntried to overtake him--and I'm--so--out of breath--I can't stir\r\nanother inch.\" The stranger eyed the old gentleman, who was panting\r\nand gasping for hard life, and then pleasantly observing, \"Then I'm\r\nhanged, old boy, if I don't have your wig,\" scampered off, leaving his\r\nvictim bald as a baby. M. Theveneau was the two thieves in one. He\r\nfirst brought his victim to a state of helplessness, and then \"carried\r\nout his little system.\" It would be difficult to assign a proper\r\npunishment to such a stupid destroyer of human life. Formerly, in the\r\nduchy of Wurtemberg, the public executioner, after having sent out of\r\nthe world a certain number of his fellow-creatures, was dignified with\r\nthe degree of doctor of physic. It would not be otherwise than well to\r\nconfer on such murderous physicians as M. Theveneau the honorary rank\r\nof hangman extraordinary.\r\n\r\nThe incomes that have been realized by blood-letting alone are not\r\nless than those which, in the present day, are realized by the\r\nadministration of chloroform. An eminent phlebotomist, not very many\r\nyears since, made a thousand per annum by the lancet.\r\n\r\nAbout blood-letting--by the lancet, leeches, and cupping (or _boxing_,\r\nas it was called in Elizabeth's days, and much later)--the curious can\r\nobtain many interesting particulars in our old friend Bulleyn's works.\r\n\r\nTo open a vein has for several generations been looked on as beneath\r\nthe dignity of the leading professors of medicine or surgery. In some\r\ncases phlebotomy was practised as a sort of specialty by surgeons of\r\nrecognised character: but generally, at the close of the last century,\r\nit was left, as a branch of practice, in the hands of the apothecary.\r\nThe occasions on which physicians have of late years used the lancet\r\nare so few, that it is almost a contribution to medical gossip to\r\nbring up a new instance. One of the more recent cases of a notability\r\nbeing let blood by a physician, was when Sir Lucas Pepys, on Oct. 2,\r\n1806, bled the Princess of Wales. On that day, as her Royal Highness\r\nwas proceeding to Norbury Park, to visit Mr. Locke, in a barouche\r\ndrawn by four horses, the carriage was upset at Leatherhead. Of the\r\ntwo ladies who accompanied the Princess, one (Lady Sheffield) escaped\r\nwithout a bruise, but the other (Miss Cholmondley) was thrown to the\r\nground and killed on the spot. The injuries sustained by the Princess\r\nwere very slight, but Sir Lucas Pepys, who luckily happened to be in\r\nthe neighbourhood at the time of the accident, bled her on his own\r\nresponsibility, and with his own hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nRICHARD MEAD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Mead,\" observed Samuel Johnson, \"lived more in the broad sunshine\r\nof life than almost any man.\"\r\n\r\nUnquestionably the lot of Richard Mead was an enviable one. Without\r\nany high advantages of birth or fortune, or aristocratic connection,\r\nhe achieved a European popularity; and in the capital of his own\r\ncountry had a social position that has been surpassed by no member of\r\nhis profession. To the sunshine in which Mead basked, the\r\nlexicographer contributed a few rays; for when James published his\r\nMedicinal Dictionary, the prefatory letter to Mead, affixed to the\r\nwork, was composed by Johnson in his most felicitous style.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,--That the Medicinal Dictionary is dedicated to you, is to be\r\nimputed only to your reputation for superior skill in those sciences\r\nwhich I have endeavoured to explain and to facilitate; and you are,\r\ntherefore, to consider the address, if it be agreeable to you, as one\r\nof the rewards of merit; and, if otherwise, as one of the\r\ninconveniences of eminence.\r\n\r\n\"However you shall receive it, my design cannot be disappointed;\r\nbecause this public appeal to your judgment will show that I do not\r\nfound my hopes of approbation upon the ignorance of my readers, and\r\nthat I fear his censure least whose knowledge is the most extensive. I\r\nam, sir, your most obedient humble servant,--R. JAMES.\"\r\n\r\nBut the sunshine did not come to Mead. He attracted it. Polished,\r\ncourtly, adroit, and of an equable temper, he seemed pleased with\r\neverybody, and so made everybody pleased with him. Throughout life he\r\nwas a Whig--staunch and unswerving, notwithstanding the charges\r\nbrought against him by obscure enemies of being a luke-warm supporter\r\nof the constitutional, and a subservient worshipper of the\r\nmonarchical, party. And yet his intimate friends were of the adverse\r\nfaction. The overbearing, insolent, prejudiced Radcliffe forgave him\r\nhis scholarship and politics, and did his utmost to advance his\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\nMead's family was a respectable one in Buckinghamshire. His father was\r\na theological writer, and one of the two ministers of Stepney, but was\r\nejected from his preferment for non-conformity on the 24th of August,\r\n1662. Fortunately the dispossessed clerk had a private fortune on\r\nwhich to maintain his fifteen children, of whom Richard, the eleventh,\r\nwas born on the eleventh of August, 1673. The first years of Richard's\r\nlife were spent at Stepney, where the Rev. Matthew Mead continued to\r\nminister to a noncomformist congregation, keeping in house Mr. John\r\nNesbitt, afterwards a conspicuous nonconformist minister, as tutor to\r\nhis children. In 1683 or 1684, it being suspected that Mr. Mead was\r\nconcerned in certain designs against the government, the worthy man\r\nhad to quit his flock and escape from the emissaries of power to\r\nHolland. During the father's residence abroad, Richard was sent to a\r\nclassical school kept in Clerkenwell Close, by the nonconformist,\r\nThomas Singleton, who had formerly been second master of Eton. It was\r\nunder this gentleman's tuition that the boy acquired a sound and\r\nextensive knowledge of Latin and Greek. In 1690 he went to Utrecht;\r\nand after studying there for three years, proceeded to Leyden, where\r\nhe studied botany and physic. His academical studies concluded, he\r\ntravelled with David Polhill and Dr. Thomas Pellet, afterwards\r\nPresident of the College of Physicians, through Italy, stopping at\r\nFlorence, Padua, Naples, and Rome. In the middle of 1696 he returned\r\nto London, with stores of information, refined manners, and a degree\r\nof Doctor of Philosophy and Physic, conferred on him at Padua, on the\r\nsixteenth of August, 1695. Settling at Stepney, and uniting himself\r\nclosely with the nonconformists, he commenced the practice of his\r\nprofession, in which he rapidly advanced to success. On the ninth of\r\nMay, 1703, before he was thirty years of age, he was chosen physician\r\nof St. Thomas's Hospital, in Southwark. On obtaining this preferment\r\nhe took a house in Crutched Friars, and year by year increased the\r\nsphere of his operations. In 1711 he moved to Austin Friars, to the\r\nhouse just vacated by the death of Dr. Howe. The consequences of this\r\nstep taught him the value, to a rising doctor, of a house with a good\r\nreputation. Many of Howe's patients had got into a habit of coming to\r\nthe house as much as to the physician, and Mead was only too glad to\r\nfeel their pulses and flatter them into good humour, sound health, and\r\nthe laudable custom of paying double fees. He was appointed Lecturer\r\non Anatomy to the Company of Barbers and Surgeons.\r\n\r\nHe kept himself well before the public, as an author, with his\r\n\"Mechanical Account of Poisons,\" published in 1702; and his treatise\r\n(1704), \"De Imperio Solis et Lunæ in Corpora humana, et Morbis inde\r\noriundis.\" He became a member of the Royal Society; and, in 1707, he\r\nreceived his M.D. diploma from Oxford, and his admission to the\r\nfellowship of the College of Physicians.\r\n\r\nIt has already been stated how Radcliffe engaged to introduce Mead to\r\nhis patients. When Queen Anne was on her death-bed, the young\r\nphysician was of importance enough to be summoned to the couch of\r\ndying royalty. The physicians who surrounded the expiring queen were\r\nafraid to say what they all knew. The Jacobites wanted to gain time,\r\nto push off the announcement of the queen's state to the last possible\r\nmoment, so that the Hanoverians should not be able to take steps for\r\nquietly securing the succession which they desired. Mead, however, was\r\ntoo earnest a Whig to sacrifice what he believed to be the true\r\ninterests of the country to any considerations of the private\r\nadvantage that might be derived by currying favour with the Tory\r\nmagnates, who, hovering about the Court, were debating how they could\r\nbest make their game. Possibly his hopes emboldened him to speak the\r\ntruth. Anyhow, he declared, on his first visit, that the queen would\r\nnot live an hour. Charles Ford, writing to Swift, said, \"This morning\r\nwhen I went there before nine, they told me she was just expiring.\r\nThat account continued above three hours, and a report was carried to\r\ntown that she was actually dead. She was not prayed for even in her\r\nown chapel at St. James's; and, _what is more infamous (!)_ stocks\r\narose three _per cent._ upon it in the city. Before I came away, she\r\nhad recovered a warmth in her breast and one of her arms; and all the\r\ndoctors agreed she would, in all probability, hold out till\r\nto-morrow--_except Mead, who pronounced, several hours before, she\r\ncould not live two minutes, and seems uneasy it did not happen so_.\"\r\nThis was the tone universally adopted by the Jacobites. According to\r\nthem, poor Queen Anne had hard measure dealt out to her by her\r\nphysicians;--the Tory Radcliffe negatively murdered her by not saving\r\nher; the Whig Mead earnestly desired her death. Certainly the\r\nJacobites had no reason to speak well of Mead, for the ready courage\r\nwith which he stated the queen's demise to be at hand gave a\r\ndisastrous blow to their case, and did much to seat George I. quietly\r\non the throne. Miss Strickland observes, \"It has always been\r\nconsidered that the prompt boldness of this political physician (_i.\r\ne._ Mead) occasioned the peaceable proclamation of George I. The\r\nqueen's demise in one hour was confidently predicted by her Whig\r\ndoctor. He was often taunted afterwards with the chagrin his\r\ncountenance expressed when the royal patient, on being again blooded,\r\nrecovered her speech and senses.\"\r\n\r\nOn the death of Radcliffe, the best part of his empire descended to\r\nMead, who, having already reaped the benefit of occupying the nest\r\nwhich Howe vacated at the summons of death, wisely resolved to take\r\npossession of Radcliffe's vacated mansion in Bloomsbury Square. This\r\nremoval from Austin Friars to the more fashionable quarter of town was\r\neffected without delay. Indeed, Radcliffe was not buried when Mead\r\nentered his house. As his practice lay now more in the West than the\r\nEast end of town, the prosperous physician resigned his appointment at\r\nSt. Thomas's, and, receiving the thanks of the grand committee for his\r\nservices, was presented with the staff of a governor of the charity.\r\nRadcliffe's practice and house were not the only possessions of that\r\nsagacious practitioner which Mead contrived to acquire. Into his hands\r\nalso passed the doctor's gold-headed cane of office. This wand became\r\nthe property successively of Radcliffe, Askew, Pitcairn, and Baillie,\r\nthe arms of all which celebrated physicians are engraved on its head.\r\nOn the death of Dr. Baillie, Mrs. Baillie presented the cane, as an\r\ninteresting professional relic, to the College of Physicians, in the\r\nlibrary of which august and learned body it is now preserved. Some\r\nyears since the late respected Dr. Macmichael made the adventures of\r\nthis stick the subject of an agreeable little book, which was\r\npublished under the title of \"The Gold-Headed Cane.\"\r\n\r\nThe largest income Mead ever made in one year was £7000. For several\r\nyears he received between £5000 and £6000 per annum. When the great\r\ndepreciation of the currency is taken into account, one may affirm,\r\nwith little fear of contradiction, that no living physician is at the\r\npresent time earning as much. Mead, however, made his income without\r\nany avaricious or stingy practices. In every respect he displayed\r\nthat generosity which has for generations been the glorious\r\ndistinction of his profession. At home his fee was a guinea. When he\r\nvisited a patient of good rank and condition, in consultation or\r\notherwise, he expected to have two guineas, or even more. But to the\r\napothecaries who waited on him at his coffee-houses, he charged (like\r\nRadcliffe) only half-a-guinea for prescriptions, written without\r\nseeing the patient. His evening coffee-house was Batson's, frequented\r\nby the profession even down to Sir William Blizard; and in the\r\nforenoons he received apothecaries at Tom's, near Covent Garden. In\r\nMead's time the clergy, as a body, were unable to pay the demands\r\nwhich professional etiquette would have required the physician to make\r\non them if he had any. It is still the humane custom of physicians and\r\neminent surgeons not to accept fees from curates, half-pay officers in\r\nthe army and navy, and men of letters; and no one has more reason than\r\nthe writer of these pages to feel grateful for the delicacy with which\r\nthey act on this rule, and the benevolent zeal with which they seem\r\nanxious to drown the sense of obligation (which a gratuitous patient\r\nnecessarily experiences) in increased attention and kindness, as if\r\ntheir good deeds were a peculiar source of pleasure to themselves.\r\n\r\nBut in the last century the beneficed clergy were in a very different\r\npecuniary condition from that which they at present enjoy. Till the\r\nTithe Communication Act passed, the parson (unless he was a sharp man\r\nof business, shrewd and unscrupulous as a horse-jobber, and ready to\r\nhave an unintermittent war with his parishioners) never received\r\nanything like what he was entitled to of the produce of the land.\r\nOften he did not get half his dues; and even when he did obtain a fair\r\ntithe, his receipts were small compared with what his successor in the\r\npresent generation has from the same source. Agriculture was then in\r\nsuch a backward state, and land was so ill-cultivated, that the rector\r\nof a large parish of good land was justly entitled only to a sum that\r\na modern rent-charge holder would regard with painful surprise if told\r\nthat he might take nothing more for his share in the fruits of the\r\nearth. The beneficed clergy were a comparatively poor body. The curate\r\nperhaps was not in a worse state than he is in now, for the simple\r\nreason that a worse can hardly be. To add to the impoverished\r\nappearance of the clerical profession, there existed in every capital\r\nand country town the luckless nonconforming clergy, bereft of the\r\nemoluments of their vocation, and often reduced to a condition\r\nscarcely--if at all--removed from begging. The title of _Reverend_ was\r\nstill affixed to their names--their costume was still that of their\r\norder--and by large masses of the people they were regarded with more\r\nreverence and affection than the well-fed Vicars of Bray, who, with\r\nmealy mouths and elastic consciences, saw only the butter on one side\r\nof their bread, and not the dirt on the other. Archbishop Sancroft\r\ndied on his little farm in Suffolk, having for years subsisted on\r\nabout fifty pounds a-year. When such was the fate of an Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury, the straits to which the ejected vicars or disabled\r\ncurates were brought can be imagined--but scarcely described. In the\r\ngreat towns these unfortunate gentlemen swarmed, gaining a wretched\r\nsubsistence as ushers in schools, tutors, secretaries--not\r\nunfrequently as domestic servants.\r\n\r\nIn such a condition of the established church, the rule of never\r\ntaking money from \"the cloth\" was almost invariably observed by the\r\nmembers of the medical profession.\r\n\r\nMead once--and only once--departed from this rule. Mr. Robert Leake, a\r\nfellow of St. John's College, Cambridge, called on the doctor and\r\nsought his advice. The patient's ill-health had been in a great degree\r\neffected by doctoring himself--that is, exhibiting, according to his\r\nown notions of medical practice, some of Dr. Cheyne's prescriptions.\r\n\r\n\"Do as I tell you,\" said Mead, \"and I'll set you up again.\"\r\n\r\nFor a time Leake cheerfully obeyed; but soon--although his case was\r\nprogressing most favourably--he had the bad taste to suggest that a\r\nrecurrence to some of Cheyne's prescriptions would be advisable. Mead,\r\nof course, was not pleased with such folly, but continued his\r\nattendance till his patient's health was restored. Leake then went\r\nthrough the form of asking to what amount he was in the physician's\r\ndebt.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" answered Mead, \"I have never yet, in the whole course of my\r\npractice, taken or demanded the least fee from any clergyman; but,\r\nsince you have been pleased, contrary to what I have met with in any\r\nother gentleman of your profession, to prescribe to me rather than\r\nfollow my prescriptions, when you had committed the care of your\r\nrecovery to my skill and trust, you must not take it amiss, nor will,\r\nI hope, think it unfair, if I demand ten guineas of you.\"\r\n\r\nWith much reluctance, and a wry face, Leake paid the money, but the\r\ndoctor subsequently returned him more than half of it.\r\n\r\nOf course Mead did not gain the prize of his profession without a few\r\nrough contests with competitors in the race of honour. Woodward, the\r\nProfessor of Physic at the Gresham College, attacked him with\r\nbitterness in his \"State of Physic and Diseases,\" and made himself\r\neven more obnoxious in his personal demeanour to him in public. Some\r\ninsult offered to him by Woodward so infuriated Mead, that the latter\r\ndrew his sword and ordered his adversary to defend himself. The duel\r\nterminated in Mead's favour, as far as martial prowess was concerned,\r\nfor he disarmed Woodward and ordered him to beg for his life.\r\n\r\n\"Never, till I am your patient,\" answered Woodward, happily.\r\n\r\nThe memory of this Æsculapian battle is preserved in an engraving in\r\nWard's \"Lives of the Gresham Professors.\" The picture is a view of\r\nGresham Street College, with a gateway entering from Broad Street,\r\nmarked 25, within which Woodward is represented as kneeling and\r\nsubmissively yielding his sword to Mead. Ward was one of Mead's\r\nwarmest friends, and certainly on this occasion displayed his\r\nfriendship in a very graceful and effective manner.\r\n\r\nThe doctor would gladly have never had to deal with a more dangerous\r\nantagonist than Woodward; but the time came when he had to run for\r\nsafety, and that too from a woman. He was in attendance by the\r\nbed-side of the Duke of Marlborough, who was suffering from\r\nindisposition, when her Grace--the celebrated Sarah--flew into a\r\nviolent rage at some remark which the physician had dared to make. She\r\neven threatened him with personal chastisement, and was proceeding to\r\ncarry out her menaces, when Mead, recognizing the peril of his\r\nposition, turned and fled from the room. The duchess ran after him,\r\nand, pursuing him down the grand staircase, vowed she would pull off\r\nhis wig, and dash it in his face. The doctor luckily was a better\r\nrunner than her Grace, and escaped.\r\n\r\nEnvy is the shadow of success, and detraction is the echo of its\r\nvoice. A host of pamphleteers, with just courage enough to print lies,\r\nto which they had not the spirit to affix their obscure names, hissed\r\ntheir malignity at the fortunate doctor. The members of the Faculty,\r\naccustomed though they are to the jealousies and animosities which are\r\nimportant undercurrents in every fraternity, would in these days\r\nscarcely credit the accounts which could be given of the coarseness\r\nand baseness of the anonymous rascals who lampooned Mead. It is\r\npainful to know that some of the worst offenders were themselves\r\nphysicians. In 1722, appeared \"The Art of getting into Practice in\r\nPhysick, here at present in London. In a letter to that very ingenious\r\nand most learned Physician (Lately come to Town), Dr Timothy\r\nVanbustle, M.D.--A.B.C.,\" the writer of this satire attributes to the\r\ndead Radcliffe the practices to which Hannes was accused of having\r\nresorted. \"Thus the famous R----fe, 'tis said, on his first arrival,\r\nhad half the porters in town employed to call for him at all the\r\ncoffee-houses and public places, so that his name might be known.\" The\r\nsting of the publication, the authorship of which by a strange error\r\nhas been attributed _to_ Mead, is throughout directed _at_ him. It is\r\nmore than suggested that he, to creep up into practice, had associated\r\nin early life with \"women, midwives, nurses, and apothecaries,\" and\r\nthat he had interested motives for being very gentle \"in taking fees\r\nof the clergy, of whatsoever sect or opinion.\" Here is a stab that the\r\nreader of the foregoing pages can appreciate: \"As to _Nostrums_, I\r\ncannot much encourage you to trade in these if you would propose to\r\nget universal business; for though they may serve to make you known at\r\nfirst, particularly in such a way, yet it will not promote general\r\nbusiness, but on the contrary. _I rather therefore would advise you to\r\ncourt, flatter, and chime in with the chief in Play, and luckily a\r\nnoted practitioner should drop, do you be as sure and ready to get\r\ninto his house as he is into his coffin._\"\r\n\r\nMore scandal of this sort may be found in \"An account of a Strange and\r\nWonderful Dream. Dedicated to Doctor M----d,\" published 1719. It is\r\ninsinuated in the dream that his Latin writings were not his own\r\ncomposition. The troubles of his domestic life are dragged before the\r\npublic. \"It unluckily happen'd that, just as Mulso discovered his\r\nwife's intrigues, his effects were seized on by his creditors, his\r\nchariot and horses were sold, and he himself reduced to the state of a\r\nfoot-quack. In this condition he had continued to this day, had he not\r\nbeen retrieved from poverty and contempt by the recommendation of a\r\nphysician of great note. Upon this he spruced up, looked gay, roll'd\r\nabout in a chariot. At this time he fell ill of the _scribendi\r\ncacoethes_, and, by the help of two mathematicians and an usher, was\r\ndelivered of a book in a learned language.\"\r\n\r\nMead did not long occupy Radcliffe's house in Bloomsbury Square. In\r\n1719 he moved to the imposing residence in Ormond Street, to which in\r\n1732 he added a gallery for the accommodation of his library and\r\nmuseum.\r\n\r\nOf Mead's various contributions to medical literature it is of course\r\nnot the province of this work to speak critically. The _Medica Sacra_\r\nis a literary curiosity, and so is the doctor's paper published in\r\n1735, in which he recommends a compound of pepper and _lichen cinereus\r\nterrestris_ as a specific against the bite of a mad dog. Dampier, the\r\ntraveller, used this lichen for the same purpose. The reader need not\r\nbe reminded of the popularity attained by this antidote, dividing the\r\npublic favour, as it did, with Dr. James's _Turpeth Mineral_, and the\r\n_Musk_ and _Cinnabar_.\r\n\r\nMead was married twice. His first wife was Ruth Marsh, the daughter of\r\na pious London tradesman. She died in 1719, twenty years after her\r\nmarriage, leaving behind her four children--three daughters, who all\r\nmarried well, and one son, William Mead. If any reliance is to be\r\nplaced on the statements of the lampoon writers, the doctor was by no\r\nmeans fortunate in this union. He married, however, a second\r\ntime--taking for his bride, when he was more than fifty years old,\r\nAnne, the daughter of Sir Rowland Alston, of Odell, a Bedfordshire\r\nbaronet.\r\n\r\nOne of the pleasant episodes in Mead's life is his conduct towards his\r\ndear friend and political antagonist, Freind--the Jacobite physician,\r\nand Member of Parliament for Launceston. On suspicion of being\r\nconcerned in the Atterbury plot, Freind was committed to the Tower.\r\nDuring his confinement, that lasted some months, he employed himself\r\ncalmly on the composition of a Latin letter, \"On certain kinds of\r\nSmall-Pox,\" and the \"History of Physic, from the time of Galen to the\r\nCommencement of the Sixteenth Century.\" Mead busied himself to obtain\r\nhis friend's release; and, being called to attend Sir Robert Walpole,\r\npleaded so forcibly for the prisoner, that the minister allowed him to\r\nbe discharged on bail--his sureties being Dr. Mead, Dr. Hulse, Dr.\r\nLevet, and Dr. Hale. To celebrate the termination of Freind's\r\ncaptivity, Mead called together on a sudden a large party in Ormond\r\nStreet, composed of men of all shades of opinion. Just as Freind was\r\nabout to take his leave for his own residence in Albemarle Street,\r\naccompanied by Arbuthnot, who resided in Cork Street, Burlington\r\nGardens, Mead took him aside into a private room, and presented him\r\nwith a case containing the fees he had received from the Tory doctor's\r\npatients during his imprisonment. They amounted to no less than five\r\nthousand guineas.\r\n\r\nMead's style of living was very liberal. From the outset to the close\r\nof his career he was the companion of men whom it was an honour to\r\ntreat hospitably. He was the friend of Pope, Newton, and Bentley. His\r\ndoors were always open to every visitor who came from a foreign\r\ncountry to these shores, with any claim whatever on the goodwill of\r\nsociety. To be at the same time a patron of the arts, and a liberal\r\nentertainer of many guests, demands no ordinary expenditure. Mead died\r\ncomparatively poor. The sale of his library, pictures, statues, and\r\ncuriosities, realized about £16,000, and he had other property\r\namounting to about £35,000; but, after the payment of his debts, not\r\nmore than £20,000 remained to be divided amongst his four children.\r\nHis only son, however, was amply provided for, having entered into the\r\npossession of £30,000 under will of Dr. Mead's unmarried brother\r\nSamuel, an eminent barrister, and a Commissioner of the Customs.\r\n\r\nFortunate beyond fortunate men, Mead had the great misfortune of\r\nliving too long. His sight failed, and his powers underwent that\r\ngradual decay which is the saddest of all possible conclusions to a\r\nvigorous and dignified existence. Stories might be ferreted up of the\r\nindignities to which he submitted at the hands of a domineering valet.\r\nLong, however, before he sunk into second childhood, he excited the\r\nridicule of the town by his vanity, and absurd pretensions to be a\r\nlady-killer. The extravagances of his amorous senility were whispered\r\nabout; and, eventually, some hateful fellow seized hold of the\r\nunpleasant rumours, and published them in a scandalous novelette,\r\ncalled \"The Cornutor of Seventy-five; being a genuine narrative of the\r\nLife, Adventures, and Amours of _Don Ricardo Honeywater_, Fellow of\r\nthe Royal College of Physicians at Madrid, Salamanca, and Toledo, and\r\nPresident of the Academy of Sciences in Lapland; containing, amongst\r\nother most diverting particulars, his intrigue with Donna Maria\r\nW----s, of Via Vinculosa--_anglice_, Fetter Lane--in the city of\r\nMadrid. Written, originally, in Spanish, by the Author of Don Quixot,\r\nand translated into English by a Graduate of the College of Mecca, in\r\nArabia.\" The \"Puella fabri,\" as Greenfield designates the damsel who\r\nwarmed the doctor's aged heart, was the daughter of a blacksmith in\r\nFetter Lane; and to please her, Mead--long past threescore years and\r\nten--went to Paris, and learnt dancing, under Dupré, giving as an\r\nexcuse that his health needed active muscular exercise.\r\n\r\nDr. Mead died on February 16, 1754, in his eighty-first year. He was\r\nburied in the Temple Church, by the side of his brother Samuel. His\r\nmemory has been honoured with busts and inscriptions--in Westminster\r\nAbbey, and the College of Physicians.\r\n\r\nMead was not the first of his name to enter the medical profession.\r\nWilliam George Meade was an eminent physician at Tunbridge Wells; and\r\ndying there on the 4th of November, 1652, was buried at Ware, in\r\nHertfordshire. This gentleman left £5 a-year for ever to the poor; but\r\nhe is more remarkable for longevity than generosity. He died at the\r\nextraordinary age of 148 years and nine months. This is one of the\r\nmost astonishing instances of longevity on record. Old Parr, dying at\r\n152 years of age, exceeded it only by 4 years. The celebrated Countess\r\nDesmond was some years more than 140 at the time of her death. Henry\r\nRead, minister of Hardwicke, Co. Northampton, numbered only 132 years;\r\nand the Lancashire woman (the _Cricket of the Hedge_) did not outlive\r\nthe 141st year. But all these ages become insignificant when put by\r\nthe side of the 169 years to which Henry Jenkins protracted his\r\nearthly sojourn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nIMAGINATION AS A REMEDIAL POWER.\r\n\r\n\r\nAstrology, alchemy, the once general belief in the healing effects of\r\nthe royal touch, the use of charms and amulets, and mesmerism, are\r\nonly various exhibitions of one superstition, having for their essence\r\nthe same little grain of truth, and for their outward expression\r\ndifferent forms of error. Disconnected as they appear at first sight,\r\na brief examination discovers the common features which prove them to\r\nbe of one family. By turns they have--each of them--given humiliating\r\nevidence of the irrational extravagances that reasoning creatures are\r\ncapable of committing; and each of them, also, has conferred some\r\nbenefits on mankind. The gibberish of Geber, and the alchemists who\r\npreceded and followed him, led to the study of chemistry, the utility\r\nand importance of which science we have only begun rightly to\r\nappreciate; and a curiosity about the foolishness of astrology led Sir\r\nIsaac Newton to his astronomical inquiries. Lord Bacon says--\"The sons\r\nof chemistry, while they are busy seeking the hidden gold--whether\r\nreal or not--have by turning over and trying, brought much profit and\r\nconvenience to mankind.\" And if the delusions of talismans, amulets,\r\nand charms, and the impostures of Mesmer, have had no greater\r\nconsequences, they have at least afforded, to the observant and\r\nreflective, much valuable instruction with regard to the constitution\r\nof the human mind.\r\n\r\nIn the history of these superstitions we have to consider the\r\nuniversal faith which men in all ages have entertained in planetary\r\ninfluence, and which, so long as day and night, and the moon and tides\r\nendure, few will be found so ignorant or so insensible as to question.\r\nThe grand end of alchemy was to transmute the base metals into gold;\r\nand it proposed to achieve this by obtaining possession of the\r\ndifferent fires transmitted by the heavenly bodies to our planet, and\r\nsubjecting, according to a mysterious system, the comparatively\r\nworthless substances of the mineral world to the forces of these\r\nfires.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" says Paracelsus, in his \"Secrets of Alchemy,\" \"we come to\r\nspeake of a manifold spirit or fire, which is the cause of variety and\r\ndiversity of creatures, so that there cannot one be found right like\r\nanother, and the same in every part; as it may be seen in metals, of\r\nwhich there is none which hath another like itself; the _Sun_\r\nproduceth his gold; the _Moon_ produceth another metal far different,\r\nto wit, silver; _Mars_ another, that is to say, iron; _Jupiter_\r\nproduceth another kind of metal to wit, tin; _Venus_ another, which is\r\ncopper; and _Saturn_ another kind, that is to say, lead: so that they\r\nare all unlike, and several one from another; the same appeareth to be\r\nas well amongst men as all other creatures, the cause whereof is the\r\nmultiplicity of fire.... Where there is no great mixture of the\r\nelements, the Sun bringeth forth; where it is a little more thick, the\r\nMoon; where more gross, Venus; and thus, according to the diversity of\r\nmixtures, are produced divers metals; so that no metal appeared in the\r\nsame mine like another.\"\r\n\r\nThis, which is an extract from Turner's translation of Paracelsus's\r\n\"Secrets of Alchemy\" (published in 1655), may be taken as a fair\r\nsample of the jargon of alchemy.\r\n\r\nThe same faith in planetary influence was the grand feature of\r\nastrology, which regarded all natural phenomena as the effects of the\r\nstars acting upon the earth. Diseases of all kinds were referable to\r\nthe heavenly bodies; and so, also, were the properties of those herbs\r\nor other objects which were believed in as remedial agents. In ancient\r\nmedicine, pharmacy was at one period only the application of the\r\ndreams of astrology to the vegetable world. The herb which put an ague\r\nor madness to flight, did so by reason of a mystic power imparted to\r\nit by a particular constellation, the outward signs of which quality\r\nwere to be found in its colour or aspect. Indeed, it was not enough\r\nthat \"a simple,\" impregnated with curative power by heavenly beams,\r\nshould be culled; but it had to be culled at a particular period of\r\nthe year, at a particular day of the month, even at a particular hour,\r\nwhen the irradiating source of its efficacy was supposed to be\r\naffecting it with a peculiar force; and, moreover, it had to be\r\nremoved from the ground or the stem on which it grew with a particular\r\ninstrument or gesture of the body--a disregard of which forms would\r\nhave obviated the kindly influence of the particular star, without\r\nwhose benignant aid the physician and the drug were alike powerless.\r\n\r\nMedical practitioners smile now at the mention of these absurdities.\r\nBut many of them are ignorant that they, in their daily practice, help\r\nto perpetuate the observance of one of these ridiculed forms. The sign\r\nwhich every member of the Faculty puts before his prescriptions, and\r\nwhich is very generally interpreted as an abbreviation for _Recipe_,\r\nis but the astrological symbol of Jupiter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _AN ACCIDENT_]\r\n\r\nIt was on this principle that a belief became prevalent that certain\r\nobjects, either of natural formation or constructed by the instruments\r\nof art, had the power of counteracting noxious agents. An intimate\r\nconnection was supposed to exist between the form or colour of an\r\nexternal substance and the use to which it ought to be put. Red\r\nobjects had a mysterious influence on inflammatory diseases; and\r\nyellow ones had a similar power on those who were discoloured with\r\njaundice. Edward II.'s physician, John of Gaddesden, informs us, \"When\r\nthe son of the renowned King of England lay sick of the small-pox, I\r\ntook care that everything round the bed should be of a red colour,\r\nwhich succeeded so completely that the Prince was restored to perfect\r\nhealth without a vestige of a pustule remaining.\" Even as late as\r\n1765, this was put in practice to the Emperor Francis I. The earliest\r\ntalismans were natural objects, with a more or less striking external\r\ncharacter, imagined to have been impressed upon them by the planets of\r\nwhose influence they were especially susceptible, and of whose virtues\r\nthey were beyond all other substances the recipients. The amulet\r\n(which differs little from the talisman, save in that it must be\r\nworn suspended upon the person it is to protect, whereas the talisman\r\nmight be kept by its fortunate possessor locked up in his\r\ntreasure-house) had a like origin.\r\n\r\nBut when once a superstitious regard was paid to the external marks of\r\na natural object, it was a short and easy step to produce the\r\nsemblances of the revered characters by an artificial process, and\r\nthen bestow on them the reverential feelings which had previously been\r\ndirected to their originals. The ordinary course taken by a\r\nsuperstition in its degradation is one where its first sentiment\r\nbecomes lost to sight, and its form is dogmatically insisted on. It\r\nwas so in that phase of feticism which consisted in the blind reliance\r\nput on artificial talismans and amulets. The original significance of\r\nthe talisman--the truth which was embodied in it as the emblem of the\r\nunseen powers that had produced it, in accordance with natural\r\noperations--was forgotten. The rows of lines and scratches, and the\r\nvariegations of its colour, were only thought of; and the cunning of\r\nman--ever ready to make a god for himself--was exerted to improve upon\r\nthem. In the multitude of new devices came inscriptions of mystic\r\nnumbers, strange signs, agglomerations of figures, and scraps from\r\nsacred rituals--Abraxas and Abracadabra, and the Fi-fo-fum nonsense of\r\nthe later charms.\r\n\r\nCreatures that were capable of detecting the influence of the\r\nplanetary system on that portion of Nature which is unquestionably\r\naffected by it, and of imagining its presence in inanimate objects,\r\nwhich, to use cautious language, have never been proved by science to\r\nbe sensible of such a power, of course magnified its consequences in\r\nall that related to the human intellect and character. The instant in\r\nwhich a man entered the world was regarded as the one when he was most\r\nsusceptible. Indeed, a babe was looked upon as a piece of warm and\r\npliant wax: and the particular planet which was in the ascendant when\r\nthe nurse placed the new child of Adam amongst the people of earth\r\nstamped upon it a distinctive charactery. To be born under a\r\nparticular star was then an expression that meant something. On the\r\nnature of the star it depended whether homunculus, squealing out its\r\nfirst agonies, was to be morose or gentle, patient or choleric, lively\r\nor saturnine, amorous or vindictive--a warrior or a poet--a dreamer or\r\na man of action.\r\n\r\nLaughing at the refinements of absurdity at which astrology had\r\narrived in his day, the author of \"Hudibras\" says:--\r\n\r\n    \"There's but the twinkling of a star\r\n    Between a man of peace and war;\r\n    A thief and justice, fool and knave,\r\n    A huffing officer and slave;\r\n    A crafty lawyer and a pickpocket,\r\n    A great philosopher and a blockhead;\r\n    A formal preacher and a player,\r\n    A learned physician and manslayer.\r\n    As if men from stars did suck\r\n    Old age, diseases, and ill-luck,\r\n    Wit, folly, honour, virtue, vice,\r\n    Travel and women, trade and dice;\r\n    And draw, with the first air they breathe,\r\n    Battle and murder, sudden death.\r\n    Are not these fine commodities\r\n    To be imported from the skies,\r\n    And vended here amongst the rabble\r\n    For staple goods and warrantable?\"\r\n\r\nInvolved in this view of the universe was the doctrine that some\r\nexceptional individuals were born far superior to the mass of their\r\nfellow-creatures. Absurd as astrology was, still, its postulates\r\nhaving once been granted, the logic was unassailable which argued that\r\nthose few on whose birth lucky stars had shone benignantly, had a\r\ndestiny and an organization distinct from those of ordinary mortals.\r\nThe dicta of modern liberalism, and the Transatlantic dogma that \"all\r\nmen are by nature born equal,\" would have appeared to an orthodox\r\nbeliever in this planetary religion nothing better than the ravings of\r\nmadness or impiety. Monarchs of men, whatever lowly station they at\r\nfirst occupied in life, were exalted above others because they\r\npossessed a distinctive excellence imparted to them at the hour of\r\nbirth by the silent rulers of the night. It was useless to strive\r\nagainst such authority. To contend with it would have been to wrestle\r\nwith the Almighty--ever present in his peculiarly favoured creatures.\r\n\r\nRulers being such, it was but natural for their servile worshippers to\r\nbelieve them capable of imparting to others, by a glance of the eye or\r\na touch of the hand, an infinitesimal portion of the virtue that dwelt\r\nwithin them. To be favoured with their smiles was to bask in sunshine\r\namid perfumes. To be visited with their frowns was to be chilled to\r\nthe marrow, and feel the hail come down like keen arrows from an angry\r\nsky. To be touched by their robes was to receive new vigour. Hence\r\ncame credence in the miraculous power of the imposition of royal, or\r\notherwise sacred hands. Pyrrhus and Vespasian cured maladies by the\r\ntouch of their fingers; and, long before and after them, earthly\r\npotentates and spiritual directors had, both in the East and the West,\r\nto prove their title to authority by displaying the same faculty.\r\n\r\nIn our own country more than in any other region of Christendom this\r\nsuperstition found supporters. From Edward the Confessor down to Queen\r\nAnne, who laid her healing hands on Samuel Johnson, it flourished; and\r\nit was a rash man who, trusting to the blind guidance of human reason\r\ndared to question that manifestation of the divinity which encircles\r\nkingship. Doubtless the gift of money made to each person who was\r\ntouched did not tend to bring the cure into dis-esteem. It can be\r\neasily credited that, out of the multitude who flocked to the presence\r\nof Elizabeth and the Stuart kings for the benefit of their miraculous\r\nmanipulations, there were many shrewd vagabonds who had more faith in\r\nthe coin than in the touch bestowed upon them. The majority, however,\r\nit cannot be doubted, were as sincere victims of delusion as those\r\nwho, at the close of the last century, believed in the efficacy of\r\nmetallic tractors, and those who now unconsciously expose their\r\nintellectual infirmity as advocates of electro-biology and\r\nspirit-rapping. The populace, as a body, unhesitatingly believed that\r\ntheir sovereigns possessed this faculty as the anointed of the Lord. A\r\nstory is told of a Papist, who, much to his astonishment, was cured of\r\nthe king's evil by Elizabeth, after her final rupture with the court\r\nof Rome.\r\n\r\n\"Now I perceive,\" cried the man, \"by plain experience that the\r\nexcommunication against the Queen is of no effect, since God hath\r\nblessed her with such a gift.\"\r\n\r\nNor would it be wise to suppose that none were benefited by the\r\ntreatment. The eagerness with which the vulgar crowd to a sight, and\r\nthe intense excitement with which London mobs witness a royal\r\nprocession to the houses of Parliament, or a Lord Mayor's pageant on\r\nits way from the City to Westminster, may afford us some idea of the\r\ninspiriting sensations experienced by a troop of wretches taken from\r\ntheir kennels to Whitehall, and brought into personal contact with\r\ntheir sovereign--their ideal of grandeur! Such a trip was a stimulus\r\nto the nervous system, compared with which the shock of a galvanic\r\nbattery would have been but the tickling of a feather. And, over and\r\nabove this, was the influence of imagination, which in many ways may\r\nbecome an agent for restoring the tone of the nervous system, and so\r\nenabling Nature to overcome the obstacles of her healthy action.\r\n\r\nMontaigne admirably treated this subject in his essay, \"Of the Force\r\nof Imagination\"; and his anecdote of the happy results derived by an\r\nunfortunate nobleman from the use of a flat gold plate, graven with\r\ncelestial figures, must have occurred to many of his readers who have\r\nwitnessed the beneficial effects which are frequently produced by the\r\npractices of quackery.\r\n\r\n\"These apes' tricks,\" says Montaigne, \"are the main cause of the\r\neffect, our fancy being so far seduced as to believe that such strange\r\nand uncouth formalities must of necessity proceed from some abstruse\r\nscience. Their very inanity gives them reverence and weight.\"\r\n\r\nAnd old Burton, touching, in his \"Anatomy of Melancholy,\" on the\r\npower of imagination, says, quaintly:--\r\n\r\n\"How can otherwise blear eyes in one man cause the like affection in\r\nanother? Why doth one man's yawning make another man yawn? Why do\r\nwitches and old women fascinate and bewitch children; but, as Wierus,\r\nParacelsus, Cardan, Migaldus, Valleriola, Cæsar Vanninus, Campanella,\r\nand many philosophers think, the forcible imagination of one party\r\nmoves and alters the spirits of the other. Nay more, they cause and\r\ncure, not only diseases, maladies, and several infirmities by this\r\nmeans, as 'Avicenna de Anim. 1. 4, sect. 4,' supposeth in parties\r\nremote, but move bodies from their places, cause thunder, lightning,\r\ntempests; which opinion Alkindus, Paracelsus, and some others approve\r\nof.\"\r\n\r\nIn this passage Burton touches not only on the effects of the\r\nimagination, but also on the impression which the nervous energy of\r\none person may create upon the nervous sensibility of another. That\r\nsuch an impression can be produced, no one can question who observes\r\nthe conduct of men in their ordinary relations to each other. By\r\nwhatever term we christen it--endeavouring to define either the cause\r\nor its effect--we all concur in admitting that decision of character,\r\nearnestness of manner, enthusiasm, a commanding aspect, a piercing\r\neye, or a strong will, exercise a manifest control over common\r\nnatures, whether they be acting separately or in masses.\r\n\r\nOf the men who, without learning, or an ennobling passion for truth,\r\nor a high purpose of any kind, have, unaided by physical force,\r\ncommanded the attention and directed the actions of large numbers of\r\ntheir fellow creatures, Mesmer is perhaps the most remarkable in\r\nmodern history. But we will not speak of him till we have paid a few\r\nminutes' attention to one of his predecessors.\r\n\r\nThe most notable forerunner of Mesmer in this country was Valentine\r\nGreatrakes, who, in Charles the Second's reign, performed \"severall\r\nmarvaillous cures by the stroaking of the hands.\" He was a gentleman\r\nof condition, and, at first, the dupe of his own imagination rather\r\nthan a deliberate charlatan. He was born on the 14th of February,\r\n1628, on his father's estate of Affane, in the County of Waterford,\r\nand was, on both sides, of more than merely respectable extraction,\r\nhis father being a gentleman of good repute and property, and his\r\nmother being a daughter of Sir Edward Harris, Knt, a Justice of the\r\nKing's Bench in Ireland. The first years of his school-life were\r\npassed in the once famous Academy of Lismore; but when he had arrived\r\nat thirteen years of age his mother (who had become a widow), on the\r\noutbreak of the rebellion, fled with him and his little brothers and\r\nsisters to England, where the fugitive family were hospitably\r\nentertained by Mr. Edmund Harris, a gentleman of considerable\r\nproperty, and one of the justice's sons. After concluding his\r\neducation in the family of one John Daniel Getseus, a High-German\r\nminister of Stock Gabriel, in the County of Devon, Valentine returned\r\nto Ireland, then distracted with tumult and armed rebellion; and, by\r\nprudently joining the victorious side, re-entered on the possession of\r\nhis father's estate of Affane. He served for six years in Cromwell's\r\nforces (from 1650 to 1656) as a lieutenant of the Munster Cavalry,\r\nunder the command of the Earl of Orrery. Valentine's commission was\r\nin the earl's regiment; and, from the time of entering the army till\r\nthe close of his career is lost sight of, he seems to have enjoyed the\r\npatronage and friendship of that nobleman's family.\r\n\r\nWhen the Munster horse was disbanded in 1656, Valentine retired to\r\nAffane, and for a period occupied himself as an active and influential\r\ncountry gentleman. He was made Clerk of the Peace for the County of\r\nCork, a Register for Transplantation, and a Justice of the Peace. In\r\nthe performance of the onerous duties which, in the then disturbed\r\nstate of Ireland, these offices brought upon him, he gained deserved\r\npopularity and universal esteem. He was a frank and commanding\r\npersonage, of pleasant manners, gallant bearing, fine figure, and\r\nsingularly handsome face. With a hearty and musical voice, and a\r\nnational stock of high animal spirits, he was the delight of all\r\nfestive assemblies, taking his pleasure freely, but never to excess.\r\nIndeed, Valentine was a devout man, not ashamed, in his own household,\r\nand in his bearing to the outer world, to avow that it was his\r\nintention to serve the Lord. But, though he had all the purity of\r\nPuritanism, there was in him no taint of sectarian rancour or\r\nuncharitableness. When an anonymous writer aspersed his reputation, he\r\nresponded--and no one could gainsay his words--with regard to his\r\npublic career:--\"I studied so to acquit myself before God and man in\r\nsingleness and integrity of heart, that, to the comfort of my soul,\r\nand praise of God that directed me, I can with confidence say I never\r\ntook bribe nor reward from any man, though I had many and great ones\r\nbefore me (when I was Register for Transplantation); nor did I ever\r\nconnive at or suffer a malefactor to go unpunished, if the person were\r\nguilty of any notorious crime (when I had power), nor did I ever take\r\nthe fee belonging to my office, if I found the person were injured, or\r\nin want; nor did I ever commit any one for his judgment and conscience\r\nbarely, so it led him not to do anything to the disturbance of the\r\ncivil peace of the nation; nor did I take anything for my fee when he\r\nwas discharged--for I bless God he has taken away a persecuting spirit\r\nfrom me, who would persuade all men to be Protestants, those\r\nprinciples being most consonant to Truth and the Word of God, in my\r\njudgment, and that profession which I have ever been of, and still\r\nam.... Yet (though there were orders from the power that then was, to\r\nall Justices of the Peace, for Transplanting all Papists that would\r\nnot go to church), I never molested any one that was known or esteemed\r\nto be innocent, but suffered them to continue in the English quarters,\r\nand that without prejudice. So that I can truly say, I never injured\r\nany man for his conscience, conceiving that ought to be informed and\r\nnot enforced.\"\r\n\r\nOn the Restoration, Valentine Greatrakes lost his offices, and was\r\nreduced to the position of a mere private gentleman. His estate at\r\nAffane was a small one; but he laboured on it with good results,\r\nintroducing into his neighbourhood a more scientific system of\r\nagriculture than had previously been known there, and giving an\r\nunprecedented quantity of employment to the poor. Perhaps he missed\r\nthe excitement of public business, and his energies, deprived of the\r\nvent they had for many years enjoyed, preyed upon his sensitive\r\nnature. Anyhow, he became the victim of his imagination, which, acting\r\non a mind that had been educated in a school of spiritual earnestness\r\nand superstitious introspection, led him into a series of remarkable\r\nhallucinations. He first had fits of pensiveness and dejection,\r\nsimilar to those which tormented Cromwell ere his genius found for\r\nitself a more fit field of display than the management of a brewery\r\nand a few acres of marsh-land. Ere long he had an impulse, or a\r\nstrange persuasion in his own mind (of which he was not able to give\r\nany rational account to another), which did very frequently suggest to\r\nhim that there was bestowed on him the gift of curing the King's Evil,\r\nwhich for the extraordinariness of it, he thought fit to conceal for\r\nsome time, but, at length communicated to his wife, and told her,\r\n\"That he did verily believe that God had given him the blessing of\r\ncuring the King's Evil; for, whether he were in private or publick,\r\nsleeping or waking, still he had the same impulse; but her reply was\r\nto him, that she conceived this was a strange imagination.\" Such is\r\nhis statement.\r\n\r\nPatients either afflicted with King's Evil, or presumed to be so, were\r\nin due course brought before him; and, on his touching them, they\r\nrecovered. It may be here remarked that in the days when the Royal\r\nTouch was believed in as a cure for scrofula, the distinctions between\r\nstrumous and other swellings were by no means ascertained even by\r\nphysicians of repute; and numbers of those who underwent the\r\nmanipulation of Anointed Rulers were suffering only from aggravated\r\nboils and common festering sores, from which, as a matter of course,\r\nnature would in the space of a few weeks have relieved them.\r\nDoubtless many of Valentine's patients were suffering, not under\r\nscrofulous affections, but comparatively innocent tumours; for his\r\ncures were rapid, complete, and numerous. A second impulse gave him\r\nthe power of curing ague; and a third inspiration of celestial aura\r\nimparted to him command, under certain conditions, over all human\r\ndiseases. His modes of operation were various. When an afflicted\r\nperson was laid before him, he usually offered up a prayer to God to\r\nhelp him, to make him the humble instrument of divine mercy. And\r\ninvariably when a patient derived benefit from his treatment, he\r\nexhorted him to offer up his thanks to his Heavenly Father. After the\r\ninitiatory supplication the operator passed his hands over the\r\naffected part of the sick person's body, sometimes over the skin\r\nitself and sometimes over the clothes. The manipulations varied in\r\nmuscular force from delicate tickling to violent rubbing, according to\r\nthe nature of the evil spirits by which the diseased people were\r\ntormented. Greatrakes's theory of disease was the scriptural one: the\r\nmorbific power was a devil, which had to be expelled from the frame in\r\nwhich it had taken shelter. Sometimes the demon was exorcised by a few\r\ngentle passes; occasionally it fled at the verbal command of the\r\nphysician, or retreated on being gazed at through the eyes of the\r\nmortal it tormented; but frequently the victory was not gained till\r\nthe healer rubbed himself--like the rubber who in our own day makes\r\nsuch a large income at Brighton--into a red face and a copious\r\nperspiration. Henry Stubbe, a famous physician in Stratford-upon-Avon,\r\nin his \"Miraculous Conformist,\" published in 1666, gives the\r\nfollowing testimony:--\r\n\r\n\"_Proofs that he revives the Ferment of the Blood._--Mr Bromley's\r\nbrother, of Upton upon Severne, after a long quartane Ague, had by a\r\nMetastasis of the Disease such a chilnesse in the habit of the body,\r\nthat no clothes could possibly warme him; he wore upon his head many\r\nspiced caps, and tenne pounds weight of linen on his head. Mr\r\nGreatarick stripped him, and rubbed him all over, and immediately he\r\nsweat, and was hot all over, so that the bath never heated up as did\r\nthe hand of Mr Greatarick's; this was his own expression. But Mr\r\nGreatarick causing him to cast off all that multitude of caps and\r\ncloaths, it was supposed that it frustrated the happy effect, for he\r\nfelt the recourse of his disease in some parts rendered the cure\r\nsuspicious. But as often as Mr Greatarick came and rubbed him he would\r\nbe all in a flame againe for half-an-hour: the experiment whereof was\r\nfrequently practised for five or six dayes at Ragly.\"\r\n\r\nGreatrakes himself also speaks of his more violent curative exertions\r\nmaking him very hot. But it was only occasionally that he had to\r\nlabour so vehemently. His eye, the glance of which had a fascinating\r\neffect on people of a nervous organization, and his fantastic\r\nticklings, usually produced all the results required by his mode of\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nThe fame of the healer spread far and wide. Not only from the most\r\nsecluded parts of Ireland, but from civilized England, the lame and\r\nblind, the deaf, dumb, and diseased, made pilgrimages to the Squire of\r\nAffane. His stable, barn, and malt-house were crowded with wretches\r\nimploring his aid. The demands upon his time were so very many and\r\ngreat, that he set apart three days in the week for the reception of\r\npatients; and on those days, from six in the morning till six in the\r\nevening, he ministered to his wretched clients. He took no fee but\r\ngratitude on the part of those he benefited, and a cheering sense that\r\nhe was fulfilling the commands of the founder of his religion. The\r\nDean of Lismore cited him to appear before the ecclesiastical court,\r\nand render an account of his proceedings. He went, and on being asked\r\nif he had worked any cures, replied to the court that they might come\r\nto his house and see. The judge asked if he had a licence to practise\r\nfrom the ordinary of the diocese; and he replied that he knew of no\r\nlaw which prohibited any man from doing what good he could to others.\r\nHe was, however, commanded by the court not to lay his hands again on\r\nthe sick, until he had obtained the Ordinary's licence to do so. He\r\nobeyed for two days only, and went on again more earnestly than ever.\r\n\r\nLet a charlatan or an enthusiast spread his sails, the breeze of\r\nfashion is always present, and ready to swell them. The Earl of Orrery\r\ntook his quondam lieutenant by the hand, and persuaded him to go over\r\nto England to cure the Viscountess Conway of a violent headache,\r\nwhich, in spite of the ablest physicians of England and France, she\r\nhad suffered from for many years. Lord Conway sent him an urgent\r\ninvitation to do so. He complied, and made his way to Rugby, in\r\nWarwickshire, where he was unable to give relief to his hostess, but\r\nwas hospitably entertained for a month. His inability to benefit Lady\r\nConway did not injure his reputation, for he did not profess to be\r\nable to cure every one. An adverse influence--such as the sins of a\r\npatient, or his want of faith--was enough to counteract the healing\r\npower. In the jargon of modern mesmerism, which _practically_ was only\r\na revival of Greatrakes's extravagances, the physician could affect\r\nonly those who were susceptible. But though Lady Conway was beyond the\r\nreach of his mysterious agency, the reverse was the case with others.\r\nThe gentry and commonalty of Warwickshire crowded by thousands to him;\r\nand he touched, prayed over, and blessed them, and sent them away\r\nrejoicing. From Rugby he went to Worcester, at the request of the Lord\r\nMayor and Aldermen of that city; and from Worcester he was carried up\r\nto London. Lord Arlington commanded him to appear at Whitehall, and\r\nmumble in his particular fashion for the amusement of Charles II. A\r\nman who could cure gout by a touch would have been an acquisition to\r\nsuch a court as then presided over English manners.\r\n\r\nIn London he immediately became a star. The fashion of the West, and\r\nthe wary opulence of the East, laid their offerings at his feet. For a\r\ntime he ruled from Soho to Wapping. Mr. Justice Godfrey gave him rooms\r\nfor the reception of patients in his mansion in Lincoln's-inn-Fields;\r\nand thither flocked the mob of the indigent and the mob of the wealthy\r\nto pay him homage. Mr. Boyle (the brother of the Earl of Orrery), Sir\r\nWilliam Smith, Dr. Denton, Dr. Fairclough, Dr. Faber, Sir Nathaniel\r\nHobart, Sir John Godolphin, Dr. Wilkins, Dr. Whichcot, and Dr.\r\nCudworth, were amongst his most vehement supporters of the sterner\r\nsex. But the majority of his admirers were ladies. The Countess of\r\nDevonshire entertained him in her palace; and Lady Ranelagh frequently\r\namused the guests at her routs with Mr. Valentine Greatrakes, who, in\r\nthe character of _the lion_ of the season, performed with wondrous\r\nresults on the prettiest or most hysterical of the ladies present. It\r\nwas held as certain by his intimate friends that the curative property\r\nthat came from him was a subtle aura, effulgent, and of an exquisitely\r\nsweet smell, that could only be termed the divine breath. \"God,\" says\r\nDr. Henry Stubbe, \"had bestowed upon Mr. Greaterick a peculiar\r\ntemperament, or composed his body of some particular ferments, the\r\neffluvia whereof, being introduced sometimes by a light, sometimes by\r\na violent friction, should restore the temperament of the debilitated\r\nparts, re-invigorate the blood, and dissipate all heterogeneous\r\nferments out of the bodies of the diseased by the eyes, nose, mouth,\r\nhands, and feet. I place the gift of healing in the temperament or\r\ncomposure of his body, because I see it is necessary that he touch\r\nthem. Besides, the Right Honourable the Lord Conway observed one\r\nmorning, as he came into his Lordship's chamber, a smell strangely\r\npleasant, as if it had been of sundry flowers; and demanding of his\r\nman what sweet water he had brought into the room, he answered,\r\n_None_; whereupon his Lordship smelled upon the hand of Mr.\r\nGreaterick, and found the fragrancy to issue thence; and examining his\r\nbosom, he found the like scent there also.\" Dean Rust gave similar\r\ntestimony; and \"Sir Amos Meredith, who had been Mr. Greaterick's\r\nbed-fellow,\" did the like.\r\n\r\nAmongst the certificates of cures performed, which Greatrakes\r\npublished, are two to which the name of Andrew Marvell is affixed, as\r\na spectator of the stroking. One of them is the following:--\r\n\r\n                   \"MR NICHOLSON'S CERTIFICATE.\r\n\r\n     \"I, Anthony Nicholson, of Cambridge, Bookseller, have been\r\n     affected sore with pains all over my body, for\r\n     three-and-twenty years last past, have had advice and best\r\n     directions of all the doctors there; have been at the bath\r\n     in Somersetshire, and been at above one hundred pounds\r\n     expense to procure ease, or a cure of these pains; and have\r\n     found all the means I could be advised or directed to\r\n     ineffectual for either, till, by the advice of Dr Benjamin\r\n     Whichcot and Dean Rust, I applyed myself to Mr Greatrake's\r\n     for help upon Saturday was sevenight, being the latter end\r\n     of March, and who then stroked me; upon which I was very\r\n     much worse, and enforced to keep my bed for five or six\r\n     days; but then being stroked twice since, by the blessing of\r\n     God upon Mr Greatrake's endeavours, I am perfectly eas'd of\r\n     all pains, and very healthy and strong, insomuch as I intend\r\n     (God willing) to return home towards Cambridge to-morrow\r\n     morning, though I was so weak as to be necessitated to be\r\n     brought up in men's arms, on Saturday last about 11 of the\r\n     clock, to Mr Greatrake's. Attested by me this tenth day of\r\n     April, 1666. I had also an hard swelling in my left arm,\r\n     whereby I was disabled from using it; which being taken out\r\n     by the said Mr Greatrake's, I am perfectly freed of all\r\n     pain, and the use thereof greatly restored.\r\n\r\n                                           \"ANTHONY NICHOLSON.\r\n\r\n     \"In the presence of Andrew Marvell, Jas. Fairclough, Tho.\r\n     Alured, Tho. Pooley, W. Popple.\"\r\n\r\nThere were worse features of life in Charles the Second's London than\r\nthe popularity of Valentine Greatrakes; but his triumph was of short\r\nduration. His professions were made the butts of ridicule, to which\r\nhis presence of mind and volubility were unable to respond with\r\neffect. It was asserted by his enemies that his system was only a\r\ncloak under which he offended the delicacy of virtuous women, and\r\nroused the passions of the unchaste. His tone of conversation was\r\nrepresented as compounded of the blasphemy of the religious enthusiast\r\nand the blasphemy of the profligate. His boast that he never received\r\na fee for his remedial services was met by flat contradiction, and a\r\nstatement that he received presents to the amount of £100 at a time\r\nfrom a single individual. This last accusation was never clearly\r\ndisposed of; but it is probable that the reward he sought (if he\r\nlooked for any) was restoration, through Court influence, to the\r\ncommission of magistrates for his county, and the lost clerkship of\r\nthe peace. The tide of slander was anyhow too strong for him, and he\r\nretired to his native country a less honoured though perhaps a not\r\nless honest man than he left it. Of his sincerity at the outset of his\r\ncareer as a healer there can be little doubt.\r\n\r\nValentine Greatrakes did unconsciously what many years after him\r\nMesmer did by design. He in his remarkable career illustrated the\r\npower which a determined man may exercise over the will and nervous\r\nlife of another.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the singular properties of the loadstone were discovered,\r\nthey were presumed to have a strong medicinal effect; and in this\r\nbelief physicians for centuries--and indeed almost down to present\r\ntimes--were in the habit of administering pulverized magnet in salves,\r\nplaisters, pills, and potions. It was not till the year 1660 that it\r\nwas for the first time distinctly recorded in the archives of science,\r\nby Dr. Gilbert, of Colchester, that in a state of pulverization the\r\nloadstone no longer possessed any magnetic powers. But it was not till\r\nsome generations after this that medical practitioners universally\r\nrecognized the fact that powder of magnet, externally or internally\r\nadministered, was capable of producing no other results than the\r\npresence of any ordinary ferruginous substance would account for. But\r\nlong after this error had been driven from the domains of science, an\r\nunreasonable belief in the power of magnets applied externally to the\r\nbody held its ground. In 1779-80, the Royal Society of Medicine in\r\nParis made numerous experiments with a view to arrive at a just\r\nappreciation of the influence of magnets on the human system, and came\r\nto the conclusion that they were medicinal agents of no ordinary\r\nefficacy.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of medical opinion at the close of the last\r\ncentury, when Perkins's tractors, which were supposed to act\r\nmagnetically, became the fashion. Mr. Perkins was a citizen of\r\nConnecticut, and certainly his celebrated invention was worthy of the\r\n'cutest people on the 'varsal earth. Barnum's swindles were modest\r\nventures by comparison. The entire world, old and new, went\r\ntractor-mad. Every valetudinarian bought the painted nails, composed\r\nof an alloy of various metals (which none but Perkins could make, and\r\nnone but Perkins sell), and tickled with their sharp ends those parts\r\nof his frame which were regarded as centres of disease.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena apparently produced by these instruments were\r\nastounding, and misled every observer of them; until Dr. Haygarth of\r\nBath proved by a process to which objections was impossible, that they\r\nwere referable not to metal points, but to the mental condition of\r\nthose who used them. \"Robert Thomas,\" says Dr. Haygarth in his\r\ninteresting work, \"aged forty-three, who had been for some time under\r\nthe care of Dr. Lovell, in the Bristol Infirmary, with a rheumatic\r\naffection of the shoulder, which rendered his arm perfectly useless,\r\nwas pointed out as a proper object of trial by Mr. J. W. Dyer,\r\napothecary to the house. Tuesday, April 19th, having everything in\r\nreadiness, I passed through the ward, and, in a way that he might\r\nsuspect nothing, questioned him respecting his complaint. I then told\r\nhim that I had an instrument in my pocket which had been very\r\nserviceable to many in his state; and when I had explained to him how\r\nsimple it was, he consented to undergo the operation. In six minutes\r\nno other effect was produced than a warmth upon the skin, and I feared\r\nthat this _coup d'essai_ had failed. The next day, however, he told me\r\nthat 'he had received so much benefit that it had enabled him to lift\r\nhis hand from his knee, which he had in vain several times attempted\r\non Monday evening, as the whole ward witnessed.' The tractors I used\r\nbeing made of lead, I thought it advisable to lay them aside, lest,\r\nbeing metallic points, the proof against the fraud might be less\r\ncomplete. Thus much, however, was proved, that the patent tractors\r\npossessed no specific power independent of simple metals. Two pieces\r\nof wood, properly shaped and painted, were next made use of; and in\r\norder to add solemnity to the farce, Mr. Barton held in his hand a\r\nstop-watch, whilst Mr. Lax minuted the effects produced. In four\r\nminutes the man raised his hand several inches; and he had lost also\r\nthe pain in his shoulder, usually experienced when attempting to lift\r\nanything. He continued to undergo the operation daily, and with\r\nprogressive good effect; for on the twenty-fifth he could touch the\r\nmantel-piece. On the twenty-seventh, in the presence of Dr. Lovell and\r\nMr. J. P. Noble, two common iron nails, disguised with sealing-wax,\r\nwere substituted for the pieces of mahogany before used. In three\r\nminutes he felt something moving from his arm to his hand, and soon\r\nafter he touched the board of rules which hung a foot above the\r\nfire-place. This patient at length so far recovered that he could\r\ncarry coals and use his arm sufficiently to help the nurse; yet,\r\nprevious to the use of the spurious tractors, he could no more lift\r\nhis hand from his knee than if a hundredweight were upon it, or a nail\r\ndriven through it--as he declared in the presence of several\r\ngentlemen, whose names I shall have frequent occasion to mention. The\r\nfame of this case brought applications in abundance; indeed, it must\r\nbe confessed that it was more than sufficient to act upon weak minds,\r\nand induce a belief that these pieces of wood and iron were endowed\r\nwith some peculiar virtues.\"\r\n\r\nThe result of Dr. Haygarth's experiments was the overthrow of Perkins,\r\nand the enlightenment of the public as to the real worth of the\r\ncelebrated metallic tractors. In achieving this the worthy physician\r\nadded some interesting facts to the science of psychology. But of\r\ncourse his influence upon the ignorant and foolish persons he\r\nilluminated was only transient. Ere a few short years or even months\r\nwere over, they had embraced another delusion--not less ridiculous,\r\nbut more pernicious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nIMAGINATION AND NERVOUS EXCITEMENT. MESMER.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt a very early date the effects of magnetic influences, and the\r\nordinary phenomena of nervous excitement, were the source of much\r\nconfusion and perplexity to medical speculators, who, with an unsound\r\nlogic that is perhaps more frequent than any other form of bad\r\nreasoning, accounted for what they could not understand by pointing to\r\nwhat they were only imperfectly acquainted with. The power of the\r\nloadstone was a mystery; the nervous phenomena produced by a strong\r\nwill over a weak one were a mystery:--clearly the mysterious phenomena\r\nwere to be attributed to the mysterious power. In its outset animal\r\nmagnetism committed no other error than this. Its wilder extravagances\r\nwere all subsequent to this assumption, that two sets of phenomena,\r\nwhich it has never yet been proved are nearly allied, were connected,\r\nthe one with the other, in the relation of cause and effect, or as\r\nbeing the offspring of one immediate and common cause.\r\n\r\nTo support this theory, Mesmerism called into its service the old\r\nastrological views regarding planetary influence. But it held also\r\nthat the subtle fluid, so transmitted to the animal life of our\r\nplanet, was capable of being passed on in greater or less volumes of\r\nquantity and intensity. Nervous energy was only that subtle fluid\r\nwhich was continually passing and repassing in impalpable currents\r\nbetween the earth and the celestial bodies; and when, by reason of the\r\nnervous energy within him, any one exercised control over another, he\r\nwas deemed only to have infused him with some of his own stock of\r\nspiritual aura. Here was a new statement of the old dream which had\r\ncharmed the poets and philosophers of buried centuries; and as it was\r\na view which did not admit of positive disproof, it was believed by\r\nits excited advocates to be proved.\r\n\r\nOne of the first British writers on animal magnetism was William\r\nMaxwell, a Scotch physician, who enunciated his opinions with a\r\nboldness and perspicacity which do him much credit. The first four of\r\nhis twelve conclusions are a very good specimen of his work:--\r\n\r\n\"_Conclusio 1._--Anima non solum in corpore proprio visibili, sed\r\netiam extra corpus est, nec corpore organico circumscribitur.\r\n\r\n\"_Conclusio 2._--Anima extra corpus proprium, communiter sic dictum,\r\noperatur.\r\n\r\n\"_Conclusio 3._--Ab omni corpore radii corporales fluunt, in quibus\r\nanima sua præsentia, operatur; hisque energiam et potentiam operandi\r\nlargitur. Sunt vero radii hi non solum corporales, sed et diversarum\r\npartium.\r\n\r\n\"_Conclusio 4._--Radii hi, qui ex animalium corporibus emittuntur,\r\nspiritu vitali gaudent, per quem animæ mutationes dispensantur.\"\r\n\r\nThe sixty-fifth of the aphorisms with which Maxwell concludes his book\r\nis an amusing one, as giving the orthodox animal-magnetic view of that\r\ncondition of the affections which we term love, and also as\r\nillustrating the connection between astrology and charms.\r\n\r\n\"_Aphorism 65._--Imaginatione vero producitur amor, quando imaginatio\r\nexaltata unius imaginationi alterius dominatur, eamque fingit\r\nsigillatque; atque hoc propter miram imaginationis volubilitatem\r\nvicissim fieri potest. Hinc incantationes effectum nanciscuntur, licet\r\naliqualem forsan in se virtutem possideant, sine imaginatione tamen\r\nhæc virtus propter universalitatem distribui nequit.\"\r\n\r\nLong before animal magnetism was a stock subject of conversation at\r\ndinner-parties, there was a vague knowledge of its pretensions\r\nfloating about society; and a curiosity to know how far its principles\r\nwere reconcilable with facts, animated men of science and lovers of\r\nthe marvellous. Had not this been the state of public feeling, the\r\nsensations created by Sir Kenelm Digby's sympathetic cures,\r\nGreatrake's administrations, Leverett's manual exercises, and\r\nLoutherbourg's manipulations, would not have been so great and\r\nuniversal.\r\n\r\nBut the person who turned the credulity of the public on this point to\r\nthe best account was Frederick Anthony Mesmer. This man did not\r\noriginate a single idea. He only traded on the old day-dreams and\r\nvagaries of departed ages; and yet he managed to fix his name upon a\r\nscience (?), in the origination or development of which he had no part\r\nwhatever; and, by daring charlatanry, he made it a means of grasping\r\nenormous wealth. Where this man was born is uncertain. Vienna,\r\nWerseburg in Swabia, and Switzerland, contend for the honour of having\r\ngiven him to the world. At Vienna he took his M.D. degree, having\r\ngiven an inaugural dissertation on \"The Influence of the Planets upon\r\nthe Human Body.\" His course of self-delusion began with using magnets\r\nas a means of cure, when applied externally; and he had resolutely\r\nadvanced on the road of positive knavery, when, after his quarrel with\r\nhis old instructor, Maximilian Hel, he threw aside the use of steel\r\nmagnets, and produced, by the employment of his fingers and eyes,\r\ngreater marvels than had ever followed the application of the\r\nloadstone or Perkins's tractors. As his prosperity and reputation\r\nincreased, so did his audacity--which was always laughable, when it\r\ndid not disgust by its impiety.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, Dr. Egg Von Ellekon asked him why he ordered his\r\npatients to bathe in river, and not in spring water? \"Because,\" was\r\nthe answer, \"river water is exposed to the sun's rays.\" \"True,\" was\r\nthe reply, \"the water is sometimes warmed by the sun, but not so much\r\nso that you have not sometimes to warm it still more. Why then should\r\nnot spring water be preferable?\" Not at all posed, Mesmer answered,\r\nwith charming candour, \"Dear doctor, the cause why all the water which\r\nis exposed to the rays of the sun is superior to all other water is\r\nbecause it is magnetized. I myself magnetized the sun some twenty\r\nyears ago.\"\r\n\r\nBut a better story of him is told by Madame Campan. That lady's\r\nhusband was attacked with pulmonary inflammation. Mesmer was sent for,\r\nand found himself called upon to stem a violent malady, not to gull\r\nthe frivolous Parisians, who were then raving about the marvels of the\r\nnew system. He felt his patient's pulse, made certain inquiries, and\r\nthen, turning to Madame Campan, gravely assured her that the only way\r\nto restore her husband to health was to lay in his bed, by his side\r\none of three things--a young woman of brown complexion, a black hen,\r\nor an old bottle. \"Sir,\" replied Madame Campan, \"if the choice be a\r\nmatter of indifference, pray try the empty bottle.\" The bottle was\r\ntried, but Mons. Campan grew worse. Madame Campan left the room,\r\nalarmed and anxious, and, during her absence, Mesmer bled and\r\nblistered his patient. This latter treatment was more efficacious. But\r\nimagine Madame Campan's astonishment, when on her husband's recovery,\r\nMesmer asked for and obtained from him a written certificate that he\r\nhad been cured by Mesmerism!\r\n\r\nIt is instructive to reflect that the Paris which made for a short day\r\nMesmer its idol, was not far distant from the Paris of the Reign of\r\nTerror. In one year the man received 400,000 francs in fees; and\r\npositively the French government, at the instigation of Maurepas,\r\noffered him an annual stipend of 20,000 francs, together with an\r\nadditional 10,000 to support an establishment for patients and pupils,\r\nif he would stay in France. One unpleasant condition was attached to\r\nthis offer: he was required to allow three nominees of the Crown to\r\nwatch his proceedings. So inordinately high did Mesmer rate his\r\nclaims, that he stood out for better terms, and like the dog of the\r\nfable, by endeavoring to get too much, lost what he might have\r\nsecured. Ere long the Parisians recovered something of common sense.\r\nThe enthusiasm of the hour subsided: and the Royal Commission,\r\ncomposed of some of the best men of science to be found in the entire\r\nworld, were enabled to explain to the public how they had been fooled\r\nby a trickster, and betrayed into practices scarcely less offensive to\r\nmodesty than to reason. In addition to the public report, another\r\nprivate one was issued by the commissioners, urging the authorities,\r\nin the name of morality, to put a stop to the mesmeric mania.\r\n\r\nMesmer died in obscurity on the 5th of March, in the year 1815.\r\n\r\nAnimal magnetism, under the name of mesmerism, has been made familiar\r\nof late years to the ears of English people, if not to their\r\nunderstandings, by the zealous and indiscreet advocacy which its\r\nabsurdities have met with in London and our other great cities. It is\r\ntrue that the disciples have outrun their master--that Mesmer has been\r\nout-mesmerized; but the same criticisms which have been here made on\r\nthe system of the arch-charlatan may be applied to the vagaries of his\r\nsuccessors, whether they be dupes or rogues. To electro-biologists,\r\nspirit-rappers, and table-turners the same arguments must be used as\r\nwe employ to mesmerists. They must be instructed that phenomena are\r\nnot to be referred to magnetic influence, simply because it is\r\ndifficult to account for them; that it is especially foolish to set\r\nthem down to such a cause, when they are manifestly the product of\r\nanother power; and that all the wonders which form the stock of their\r\nconversation, and fill the pages of the _Zoist_, are to be attributed,\r\nnot to a lately discovered agency, but to nervous susceptibility,\r\nimagination, and bodily temperament, aroused by certain well-known\r\nstimulants.\r\n\r\nThey will doubtless be disinclined to embrace this explanation of\r\ntheir marvels, and will argue that it is much more likely that a table\r\nis made by ten or twelve gentlemen and ladies to turn rapidly round,\r\nwithout the application of muscular force, than that these ladies and\r\ngentlemen should delude themselves into an erroneous belief that such\r\na phenomenon has been produced. To disabuse them of such an opinion,\r\nthey must be instructed in the wondrous and strangely delicate\r\nmechanism of the human intellect and affections. And after such\r\nenlightenment they must be hopelessly dull or perverse if they do not\r\nsee that the metaphysical explanation of \"their cases\" is not only the\r\ntrue one, but that it opens up to view far more astonishing features\r\nin the constitution of man than any that are dreamt of in the vain\r\nphilosophy of mesmerism. It is humiliating to think that these remarks\r\nshould be an appropriate comment on the silliness of the so-called\r\neducated classes of the nineteenth century. That they are out of\r\nplace, none can advance, when one of the most popular pulpit orators\r\nof London has not hesitated to commit to print, in a work of religious\r\npretensions, the almost blasphemous suggestion that table-turning is a\r\nphenomenon consequent upon the first out-poured drops of \"the seventh\r\nvial\" having reached the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nMAKE WAY FOR THE LADIES!\r\n\r\n     \"For in all times, in the opinion of the multitude, witches\r\n     and old women and impostors have had a competition with\r\n     physicians. And what followeth? Even this, that physicians\r\n     say to themselves, as Solomon expresseth it upon a higher\r\n     occasion, 'If it befall to me as befalleth to the fools, why\r\n     should I labour to be more wise?'\"--Lord Bacon's\r\n     _Advancement of Learning_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is time to say something about the ladies as physicians. Once they\r\nwere the chief practitioners of medicine; and even to recent times had\r\na monopoly of that branch of art over which Dr. Locock presides. The\r\nquestion has lately been agitated whether certain divisions of\r\nremedial industry ought not again to be set aside for them; and the\r\npatronage afforded to the lady who (in spite of the ridicule thrown on\r\nher, and the rejection of her advances by various medical schools to\r\nwhich she applied for admission as a student), managed to obtain a\r\ncourse of medical instruction at one of the London schools, and\r\npractised for a brief time in London previous to her departure for a\r\nlocality more suited to her operations, would seem to indicate that\r\npublic feeling is not averse to the thought of employing--under\r\ncertain conditions and for certain purposes--female physicians.\r\n\r\nOf the many doctresses who have flourished in England during the last\r\n200 years, only a few have left any memorial of their actions behind\r\nthem. Of _the wise women_ (a class of practitioners, by-the-by, still\r\nto be found in many rural villages and in certain parts of London) in\r\nwhom our ancestors had as much confidence as we of the present\r\ngeneration have in the members of the College of Physicians, we\r\nquestion if twoscore, including Margaret Kennix and Mrs. Woodhouse, of\r\nthe Elizabethan era, could be rescued from oblivion. Some of them\r\nwrote books, and so, by putting their names \"in print,\" have a slight\r\nhold on posthumous reputation. Two of them are immortalized by mention\r\nin the records of the \"Philosophical Transactions for 1694.\" These\r\nladies were Mrs. Sarah Hastings and Mrs. French. The curious may refer\r\nto the account there given of the ladies' skill; and also, for further\r\nparticulars relative to Sarah Hastings, a glance may be given to M. de\r\nla Cross's \"Memoirs for the Ingenious,\" published in the month of\r\nJuly, 1693. We do not care to transcribe the passages into our own\r\npages; though, now that it is the fashion to treat all the unpleasant\r\ndetails of nursing as matters of romance, we presume there is nothing\r\nin the cases mentioned calculated to shock public delicacy.\r\n\r\nA most successful \"wise woman\" was Joanna Stephens, an ignorant and\r\nvulgar creature, who, just before the middle of the last century,\r\nproclaimed that she had discovered a sovereign remedy for a painful\r\nmalady, which, like the smallpox, has become in the hands of modern\r\nsurgery so manageable that ere long it will rank as little more than\r\n\"a temporary discomfort.\" Joanna was a courageous woman. She went\r\nstraightway to temporal peers, bishops, duchesses, and told them she\r\nwas the woman for their money. They believed her, testified to the\r\nmarvellous cures which she had effected, and allowed her to make use\r\nof their titles to awe sceptics into respect for her powers. Availing\r\nherself of this permission, she published books containing lists of\r\nher cures, backed up by letters from influential members of the\r\nnobility and gentry.\r\n\r\nIn the April number of the _Gentleman's Magazine_ for the year 1738,\r\none reads--\"Mrs. Stephens has proposed to make her medicine publick,\r\non consideration of £5000 to be raised by contribution and lodged with\r\nMr. Drummond, banker; he has received since the 11th of this month\r\nabout £500 on that account.\" By the end of the month the banker had in\r\nhis hands £720 8_s._ 6_d._\r\n\r\nThis generous offer was not made until the inventor of the nostrums\r\nhad enriched herself by enormous fees drawn from the credulity of the\r\nrich of every sect and rank. The subscription to pay her the amount\r\nshe demanded for her secret was taken up enthusiastically. Letters\r\nappeared in the Journals and Magazines, arguing that no humane or\r\npatriotic man could do otherwise than contribute to it. The movement\r\nwas well whipped up by the press. The Bishop of Oxford gave £10\r\n10_s._; Bishop of Gloucester, £10 10_s._; The Earl of Pembroke, £50;\r\nCountess of Deloraine, £5 5_s._; Lady Betty Jermaine, £21; Lady Vere\r\nBeauclerc, £10 10_s._; Earl of Godolphin, £100; Duchess of Gordon, £5\r\n5_s._: Viscount Lonsdale, £52 10_s._; Duke of Rutland, £50; the\r\nBishop of Salisbury, £25; Sir James Lowther, Bart., £25; Lord Cadogan,\r\n£2 2_s._; Lord Cornwallis, £20; Duchess of Portland, £21; Earl of\r\nClarendon, £25; Lord Lymington, £5; Duke of Leeds, £21; Lord Galloway,\r\n£30; General Churchill (Spot Ward's friend), £10 10_s._; Countess of\r\nHuntingdon, £10 10_s._; Hon. Frances Woodhouse, £10 10_s._; Sir Thomas\r\nLowther, Bart., £5 5_s._; Duke of Richmond, £30; Sir George Saville,\r\nBart., £5 5_s._\r\n\r\nThese were only a few of the noble and distinguished dupes of Joanna\r\nStephens. Mrs. Crowe, in her profound and philosophic work,\r\n\"Spiritualism, and the Age we live in,\" informs us that \"the\r\nsolicitude\" about the subject of table-turning \"displayed by many\r\npersons in high places, is the best possible sign of the times; and it\r\nis one from which she herself hopes that the period is arrived when we\r\nshall receive further help from God.\" Hadn't Joanna Stephens reason to\r\nthink that the period had arrived when she and her remedial system\r\nwould receive further help from God? What would not Read (we do not\r\nmean the empiric oculist knighted by Queen Anne, but the cancer quack\r\nof our own time) give to have such a list of aristocratic supporters?\r\nWhat would not Mrs. Doctor Goss (who in this year, 1861, boasts of the\r\npatronage of \"ladies of the highest distinction\") give for a similar\r\nroll of adherents?\r\n\r\nThe agitation, however, for a public subscription for Joanna Stephens\r\nwas not so successful as her patrician supporters anticipated. They\r\nsucceeded in collecting £1356 3_s._ But Joanna stood out: her secret\r\nshould not go for less than £5000. \"No pay, no cure!\" was her cry. The\r\nnext thing her friends did was to apply to Parliament for the\r\nrequired sum--and, positively, their request was granted. The nation,\r\nout of its taxes, paid what the individuals of its wealthy classes\r\nrefused to subscribe. A commission was appointed by Parliament, that\r\ngravely inquired into the particulars of the cures alleged to be\r\nperformed by Joanna Stephens; and, finding the evidence in favour of\r\nthe lady unexceptionable, they awarded her the following certificate,\r\nwhich ought to be preserved to all ages as a valuable example of\r\nsenatorial wisdom:--\r\n\r\n               \"THE CERTIFICATE REQUIRED BY THE ACT OF\r\n                            PARLIAMENT.\r\n\r\n                                              March 5, 1739.\r\n\r\n     \"We, whose names are underwritten, being the major part of\r\n     the Justices appointed by an Act of Parliament, entitled,\r\n     '_An Act for providing a Reward to Joanna Stephens, upon\r\n     proper discovery to be made by her, for the use of the\r\n     Publick, of the Medicines prepared by her_-- --' --do\r\n     certify, that the said Joanna Stephens did, with all\r\n     convenient speed after the passing of the said Act, make a\r\n     discovery to our satisfaction, for the use of the publick,\r\n     of the said medicines, and of her method of preparing the\r\n     same; and that we have examined the said medicines, and of\r\n     her method of preparing of the same, and are convinced by\r\n     experiment of the _Utility_, _Efficacy_, and _Dissolving\r\n     Power_ thereof.\r\n\r\n  \"JO.

These two gentlemen, who were on the\r\ncommission, having some scruples about the words \"dissolving power,\"\r\ngave separate testimonials in favour of the medicines. St. John Long's\r\ncause, it may be remembered, was advocated by Dr. Ramadge, a Fellow of\r\nthe College.\r\n\r\nThe country paid its money, and obtained Joanna's prescriptions. Here\r\nis a portion of the lady's statement:--\r\n\r\n     \"_A full Discovery of the Medicines given by me, Joanna\r\n     Stephens, and a particular account of my method of preparing\r\n     and giving the same._\r\n\r\n\"My medicines are a Powder, a Decoction, and Pills.\r\n\r\n\"The Powder consists of egg-shells and snails--both calcined.\r\n\r\n\"The Decoction is made by boiling some herbs (together with a ball\r\nwhich consists of soap, swine's-cresses burnt to a blackness, and\r\nhoney) in water.\r\n\r\n\"The Pills consist of snails calcined, wild carrot seeds, burdock\r\nseeds, ashen keys, hips and hawes--all burnt to a blackness--soap and\r\nhoney.\r\n\r\n\"The powder is thus prepared:--Take hen's egg-shells, well drained\r\nfrom the whites, dry and clean; crush them small with the hands, and\r\nfill a crucible of the twelfth size (which contains nearly three\r\npints) with them lightly, place it on the fire till the egg-shells be\r\ncalcined to a greyish white, and acquire an acrid, salt taste: this\r\nwill take up eight hours, at least. After they are thus calcined, put\r\nthem in a dry, clean earthen pan, which must not be above three parts\r\nfull, that there may be room for the swelling of the egg-shells in\r\nstacking. Let the pan stand uncovered in a dry room for two months,\r\nand no longer; in this time the egg-shells will become of a milder\r\ntaste, and that part which is sufficiently calcined will fall into a\r\npowder of such a fineness, as to pass through a common hairsieve,\r\nwhich is to be done accordingly.\r\n\r\n\"In like manner, take garden snails, with their shells, cleaned from\r\nthe dirt; fill a crucible of the same size with them whole, cover it,\r\nand place it on the fire as before, till the snails have done\r\nsmoaking, which will be in about an hour--taking care that they do not\r\ncontinue in the fire after that. They are then to be taken out of the\r\ncrucible, and immediately rubbed in a mortar to a fine powder, which\r\nought to be of a very dark-grey colour.\r\n\r\n     \"_Note._--If pit-coal be made use of, it will be proper--in\r\n     order that the fire may the sooner burn clear on the\r\n     top--that large cinders, and not fresh coals, be placed upon\r\n     the tiles which cover the crucibles.\r\n\r\n\"These powders being thus prepared, take the egg-shell powder of six\r\ncrucibles, and the snail-powder of one; mix them together, and rub\r\nthem in a mortar, and pass them through a cypress sieve. This mixture\r\nis immediately to be put up into bottles, which must be close stopped,\r\nand kept in a dry place for use. I have generally added a small\r\nquantity of swine's-cresses, burnt to a blackness, and rubbed fine;\r\nbut this was only with a view to disguise it.\r\n\r\n\"The egg-shells may be prepared at any time of the year, but it is\r\nbest to do them in summer. The snails ought only to be prepared in\r\nMay, June, July, and August; and I esteem those best which are done in\r\nthe first of these months.\r\n\r\n\"The decoction is thus prepared:--Take four ounces and a half of the\r\nbest Alicant soap, beat it in a mortar with a large spoonful of\r\nswine's-cresses burnt to a blackness, and as much honey as will make\r\nthe whole of the consistence of paste. Let this be formed into a ball.\r\nTake this ball, and green camomile, or camomile flowers, sweet fennel,\r\nparsley, and burdock leaves, of each an ounce (when there are not\r\ngreens, take the same quantity of roots); slice the ball, and boil\r\nthem in two quarts of soft water half an hour, then strain it off, and\r\nsweeten it with honey.\r\n\r\n\"The pills are thus prepared:--Take equal quantities by measure of\r\nsnails calcined as before, of wild carrot seeds, burdock seeds, ashen\r\nkeys, hips and hawes, all burnt to a blackness, or, which is the same\r\nthing, till they have done smoaking; mix them together, rub them in a\r\nmortar, and pass them through a cypress sieve. Then take a large\r\nspoonful of this mixture, and four ounces of the best Alicant soap,\r\nand beat them in a mortar with as much honey as will make the whole of\r\na proper consistence for pills; sixty of which are to be made out of\r\nevery ounce of the composition.\"\r\n\r\nFive thousand pounds for such stuff as this!--and the time was coming\r\nwhen the nation grudged an inadequate reward to Jenner, and haggled\r\nabout the purchase of Hunter's Museum!\r\n\r\nBut a more remarkable case of feminine success in the doctoring line\r\nwas that of Mrs. Mapp, who was a contemporary of Mrs. Stephens. Under\r\nthe patronage of the Court, \"Drop and Pill\" Ward (or \"Spot\" Ward, as\r\nhe was also called, from a mole on his cheek) was astonishing London\r\nwith his cures, and his gorgeous equipage which he had the royal\r\npermission to drive through St. James Park, when the attention of the\r\nfashionable world was suddenly diverted to the proceeding of \"Crazy\r\nSally of Epsom.\" She was an enormous, fat, ugly, drunken woman, known\r\nas a haunter of fairs, about which she loved to reel, screaming and\r\nabusive, in a state of roaring intoxication. This attractive lady was\r\na bone-setter; and so much esteemed was she for skill in her art, that\r\nthe town of Epsom offered her £100 if she would reside there for a\r\nyear. The following passage we take from the _Gentleman's Magazine_\r\nfor 1736: \"Saturday 31. In the _Daily Advertiser_, July 28, Joshua\r\nWard, Esq., having the queen's leave, recites seven extraordinary\r\ncases of persons which were cured by him, and examined before her\r\nMajesty, June 7, objections to which had been made in the _Grub Street\r\nJournal_, June 24. But the attention of the public has been taken off\r\nfrom the wonder-working Mr. Ward to a strolling woman now at Epsom,\r\nwho calls herself Crazy Sally; and had performed cures in bone-setting\r\nto admiration, and occasioned so great a resort, that the town\r\noffered her 100 guineas to continue there a year.\"\r\n\r\n\"Crazy Sally\" awoke one morning and found herself famous. Patients of\r\nrank and wealth flocked in from every quarter. Attracted by her\r\nsuccess, an Epsom swain made an offer of marriage to Sally, which she\r\nlike a fool accepted. Her maiden name of Wallin (she was the daughter\r\nof a Wiltshire bone-setter of that name) she exchanged at the altar\r\nfor that of Mapp. If her marriage was not in all respects fortunate,\r\nshe was not burdened with much of her husband's society. He lived with\r\nher only for a fortnight, during which short space of time he thrashed\r\nher soundly twice or thrice, and then decamped with a hundred guineas\r\nof her earnings. She found consolation for her wounded affections in\r\nthe homage of the world. She became a notoriety of the first water,\r\nand every day some interesting fact appeared about her in the prints\r\nand public journals. In one we are told \"the cures of the woman\r\nbone-setter of Epsom are too many to be enumerated: her bandages are\r\nextraordinary neat, and her dexterity in reducing dislocations and\r\nsetting fractured bones wonderful. She has cured persons who have been\r\ntwenty years disabled, and has given incredible relief in the most\r\ndifficult cases. The lame come daily to her, and she gets a great deal\r\nof money, persons of quality who attend her operations making her\r\npresents.\"\r\n\r\nPoets sounded her praises. Vide _Gentleman's Magazine_, August, 1736:\r\n\r\n    \"ON MRS MAPP, THE FAMOUS BONE-SETTER OF EPSOM.\r\n\r\n    \"Of late, without the least pretence to skill,\r\n    Ward's grown a fam'd physician by a pill;\r\n    Yet he can but a doubtful honour claim,\r\n    While envious Death oft blasts his rising fame.\r\n    Next travell'd Taylor fills us with surprise,\r\n    Who pours new light upon the blindest eyes;\r\n    Each journal tells his circuit through the land,\r\n    Each journal tells the blessings of his hand;\r\n    And lest some hireling scribbler of the town\r\n    Injure his history, he writes his own.\r\n    We read the long accounts with wonder o'er;\r\n    Had he wrote less, we had believed him more.\r\n    Let these, O Mapp, thou wonder of the age!\r\n    With dubious arts endeavor to engage;\r\n    While you, irregularly strict to rules,\r\n    Teach dull collegiate pedants they are fools;\r\n    By merit, the sure path to fame pursue--\r\n    For all who see thy art must own it true.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Mapp continued to reside in Epsom, but she visited London once a\r\nweek. Her journeys to and from the metropolis she performed in a\r\nchariot drawn by four horses, with servants wearing splendid liveries.\r\nShe used to put up at the Grecian Coffee-House, where Sir Hans Sloane\r\nwitnessed her operations, and was so favourably impressed by them,\r\nthat he put under her charge his niece, who was suffering from a\r\nspinal affection, or, to use the exact and scientific language of the\r\nnewspapers, \"whose back had been broke nine years, and stuck out two\r\ninches.\" The eminent lady went to the playhouse in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields\r\nto see the _Husband's Relief_ acted. Her presence not only produced a\r\ncrowded house, but the fact that she sate between Taylor the quack\r\noculist on one side, and Ward the drysalter on the other, gave\r\noccasion for the production of the following epigram, the point of\r\nwhich is perhaps almost as remarkable as its polish:--\r\n\r\n    \"While Mapp to the actors showed a kind regard,\r\n    On one side _Taylor_ sat, on the other _Ward_;\r\n    When their mock persons of the drama came,\r\n    Both _Ward_ and _Taylor_ thought it hurt their fame;\r\n    Wonder'd how Mapp could in good humour be,\r\n    '_Zoons!_' crys the manly dame, 'it hurts not me;\r\n    Quacks without art may either blind or kill,\r\n    But demonstration proves that mine is skill.'\"\r\n\r\nOn the stage, also, a song was sung in honour of Mrs. Mapp, and in\r\nderision of Taylor and Ward. It ran thus:--\r\n\r\n    \"You surgeons of London, who puzzle your pates,\r\n    To ride in your coaches, and purchase estates,\r\n    Give over for shame, for pride has a fall,\r\n    And the doctress of Epsom has out-done you all.\r\n                                        Derry down, &c.\r\n\r\n    \"What signifies learning, or going to school,\r\n    When a woman can do, without reason or rule,\r\n    What puts you to nonplus, and baffles your art;\r\n    For petticoat practice has now got the start.\r\n                                        Derry down, &c.\r\n\r\n    \"In physic, as well as in fashions, we find\r\n    The newest has always its run with mankind;\r\n    Forgot is the bustle 'bout Taylor and Ward,\r\n    And Mapp's all the cry, and her fame's on record.\r\n                                        Derry down, &c.\r\n\r\n    \"Dame Nature has given a doctor's degree--\r\n    She gets all the patients, and pockets the fee;\r\n    So if you don't instantly prove her a cheat,\r\n    She'll loll in her carriage, whilst you walk the street.\r\n                                        Derry down, &c.\"\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, as this lady was proceeding up the Old Kent Road to\r\nthe Borough, in her carriage and four, dressed in a loosely-fitting\r\nrobe-de-chambre, and manifesting by her manner that she had partaken\r\nsomewhat too freely of Geneva water, she found herself in a very\r\ntrying position. Her fat frame, indecorous dress, intoxication, and\r\ndazzling equipage, were in the eyes of the mob such sure signs of\r\nroyalty, that she was immediately taken for a Court lady, of German\r\norigin and unpopular repute, whose word was omnipotent at St. James's.\r\n\r\nSoon a crowd gathered round the carriage, and, with the proper amount\r\nof swearing and yelling, were about to break the windows with stones,\r\nwhen the spirited occupant of the vehicle, acting very much as Nell\r\nGwyn did on a similar occasion, rose from her seat, and letting down\r\nthe glasses, exclaimed, with an imprecation more emphatic than polite,\r\n\"-- --! Don't you know me? I am Mrs. Mapp, the bone-setter!\"\r\n\r\nThis brief address so tickled the humour of the mob, that the lady\r\nproceeded on her way amidst deafening acclamations and laughter.\r\n\r\nThe Taylor mentioned as sitting on one side of Mrs. Mapp in the\r\nplayhouse was a notable character. A cunning, plausible, shameless\r\nblackguard, he was eminently successful in his vocation of quack. Dr.\r\nKing, in his \"Anecdotes of his own Times,\" speaks of him with respect.\r\n\"I was at Tunbridge,\" says the Doctor, \"with Chevalier Taylor, the\r\noculist. He seems to understand the anatomy of the eye perfectly well;\r\nhe has a fine hand and good instruments, and performs all his\r\noperations with great dexterity; but he undertakes everything (even\r\nimpossible cases), and promises everything. No charlatan ever appeared\r\nwith fitter and more excellent talents, or to greater advantage; he\r\nhas a good person, is a natural orator, and has a faculty of learning\r\nforeign languages. He has travelled over all Europe, and has always\r\nwith him an equipage suitable to a man of the first quality; and has\r\nbeen introduced to most of the sovereign princes, from whom he has\r\nreceived many marks of their liberality and esteem.\"\r\n\r\nDr. King, in a Latin inscription to the mountebank, says:--\r\n\r\n                  \"Hic est, hic vir est,\r\n    Quem docti, indoctique omnes impense mirantur,\r\n                  Johannes Taylor;\r\n          Cœcigenorum, cœcorum, cœcitantium,\r\n                Quot quot sunt ubique,\r\n              Spes unica--Solamen--Salus.\"\r\n\r\nThe Chevalier Taylor (as he always styled himself), in his travels\r\nabout the country, used to give lectures on \"The Eye,\" in whatever\r\nplace he tarried. These addresses were never explanatory of the\r\nanatomy of the organ, but mere absurd rhapsodies on it as an ingenious\r\nand wonderful contrivance.\r\n\r\nChevalier's oration to the university of Oxford, which is still\r\nextant, began thus:--\r\n\r\n\"The eye, most illustrious sons of the muses, most learned Oxonians,\r\nwhose fame I have heard celebrated in all parts of the globe--the eye,\r\nthat most amazing, that stupendous, that comprehending, that\r\nincomprehensible, that miraculous organ, the eye, is the Proteus of\r\nthe passions, the herald of the mind, the interpreter of the heart,\r\nand the window of the soul. The eye has dominion over all things. The\r\nworld was made for the eye, and the eye for the world.\r\n\r\n\"My subject is Light, most illustrious sons of\r\nliterature--intellectual light. Ah! my philosophical, metaphysical, my\r\nclassical, mathematical, mechanical, my theological, my critical\r\naudience, my subject is the eye. You are the eye of England!\r\n\r\n\"England has two eyes--Oxford and Cambridge. They are the two eyes of\r\nEngland, and two intellectual eyes. You are the right eye of England,\r\nthe elder sister in science, and the first fountain of learning in all\r\nEurope. What filial joy must exult in my bosom, in my vast circuit, as\r\ncopious as that of the sun himself, to shine in my course, upon this\r\nmy native soil, and give light even at Oxford!\r\n\r\n\"The eye is the husband of the soul!\r\n\r\n\"The eye is indefatigable. The eye is an angelic faculty. The eye in\r\nthis respect is a female. The eye is never tired of seeing; that is,\r\nof taking in, assimilating, and enjoying all Nature's vigour.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the Chevalier was ranting on in this fashion at Cambridge (of\r\ncourse there terming Oxford the _left_ eye of England), he undertook\r\nto express every passion of the mind by the eye alone.\r\n\r\n\"Here you have surprise, gentlemen; here you have delight; here you\r\nhave terror!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" cried an undergraduate, \"there's no merit in that, for you tell\r\nus beforehand what the emotion is. Now next time say nothing--and let\r\nme guess what the feeling is you desire to express.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" responded the Doctor, cordially; \"nothing can be more\r\nreasonable in the way of a proposition. Now then, sir, what is this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, veneration, I suppose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly--quite right--and this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, sir: you see it's impossible for an observant gentleman\r\nlike yourself to misunderstand the language of the eye,\" answered the\r\noculist, whose plan was only to assent to his young friend's\r\ndecisions.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1736, when the Chevalier was at the height of his fame,\r\nhe received the following humorous letter:--\r\n\r\n\"DOMINE,--O tu, qui in oculis hominum versaris, et quamcunque tractas\r\nrem, _acu_ tangis, salve! Tu, qui, instar Phœbi, lumen orbi, et\r\norbes luminibus reddis, iterum salve!\r\n\r\n\"Cum per te Gallia, per te nostræ academiæ, duo regni lumina, clarius\r\nintuentur, cur non ad urbem Edinburgi, cum toties ubique erras, cursum\r\ntendis? nam quædam cœcitas cives illic invasit. Ipsos magistratus\r\n_Gutta Serena_ occupavit, videntur enim videre, sed nihil vident.\r\nIdcirco tu istam _Scoticam Nebulam_ ex oculis remove, et quodcunque\r\nlatet in tenebris, in lucem profer. Illi violenter carcerem, tu oculos\r\nleniter reclude; illi lucem Porteio ademerunt, tu illis lucem\r\nrestitue, et quamvis fingant se dupliciter videre, fac ut simpliciter\r\ntantum oculo irretorto conspiciant. Peractoque cursu, ad Angliam redi\r\nartis tuæ plenus, Toriosque (ut vulgo vocantur) qui adhuc cœcutiant\r\net hallucinantur, illuminato. Ab ipsis clericis, si qui sint cœci\r\nductores, nubem discute; immo ipso Sole lunaque, cum laborant eclipsi,\r\nquæ, instar tui ipsius, transit per varias regiones obumbrans, istam\r\nmolem caliginis amoveto. Sic eris Sol Mundi, sic eris non solum nomine\r\nSartor, sed re Oculorum omnium resarcitor; sic omuis Charta Publica\r\ntuam Claritudinem celebrabit, et ubicunque frontem tuam ostendis, nemo\r\nnon te, O vir spectatissime, admirabitur. Ipse lippus scriptor hujus\r\nepistolæ maxime gauderet te Medicum Illustrissimum, cum omnibus tuis\r\noculatis testibus, Vindsoriæ videre.--VALE.\"\r\n\r\nThe Chevalier had a son and a biographer in the person of John Taylor,\r\nwho, under the title of \"John Taylor, Junior,\" succeeded to his\r\nfather's trumpet, and blew it with good effect. The title-page of his\r\nbiography of his father enumerates some half-hundred crowned or royal\r\nheads, to whose eyes the \"Chevalier John Taylor, Opthalmiater\r\nPontifical, Imperial, and Royal,\" administered.\r\n\r\nBut this work was feeble and contemptible compared with the\r\nChevalier's autobiographic sketch of himself, in his proposal for\r\npublishing which he speaks of his loves and adventures, in the\r\nfollowing modest style:--\r\n\r\n\"I had the happiness to be also personally known to two of the most\r\namiable ladies this age has produced--namely, Lady Inverness and Lady\r\nMackintosh; both powerful figures, of great abilities, and of the most\r\npleasing address--both the sweetest prattlers, the prettiest\r\nreasoners, and the best judges of the charms of high life that I ever\r\nsaw. When I first beheld these wonders I gazed on their beauties, and\r\nmy attention was busied in admiring the order and delicacy of their\r\ndiscourse, &c. For were I commanded to seek the world for a lady\r\nadorned with every accomplishment that man thinks desirable in the\r\nsex, I could only be determined by finding their resemblance....\r\n\r\n\"I am perfectly acquainted with the history of Persia, as well before\r\nas since the death of Thamas Kouli Khan; well informed of the\r\nadventures of Prince Heraclius; was personally known to a minister he\r\nsent to Moscow in his first attempt to conquer that country; and am\r\ninstructed in the cruel manner of putting out the eyes of conquered\r\nprinces, and of cutting away the eyelids of soldiers taken in war, to\r\nmake them unfit for service.\r\n\r\n\"I have lived in many convents of friars of different orders, been\r\npresent at their creation to various degrees, and have assisted at\r\nnumberless entertainments upon those occasions.\r\n\r\n\"I have been in almost every female nunnery in all Europe (_on account\r\nof my profession_), and could write many volumes on the adventures of\r\nthese religious beauties.\r\n\r\n\"I have been present at the making of nuns of almost every order, and\r\nassisted at the religious feasts given on those occasions.\r\n\r\n\"I have met with a very great variety of singular religious people\r\ncalled Pilgrims.\r\n\r\n\"I have been present at many extraordinary diversions designed for the\r\namusement of the sovereign, viz. hunting of different sorts of wild\r\nbeasts, as in Poland; bull-fighting, as in Spain.\r\n\r\n\"I am well acquainted with all the various punishments for different\r\ncrimes, as practised in every nation--been present at the putting of\r\ncriminals to death by various ways, viz. striking off heads, breaking\r\non the wheel, &c.\r\n\r\n\"I am also well instructed in the different ways of giving the torture\r\nto extract confession--and am no stranger to other singular\r\npunishments, such as impaling, burying alive with head above ground,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\n\"And lastly, I have assisted, have seen the manner of embalming dead\r\nbodies of great personages, and am well instructed in the manner\r\npractised in some nations for preserving them entire for ages, with\r\nlittle alteration of figure from what they were when first deprived of\r\nlife....\r\n\r\n\"All must agree that no man ever had a greater variety of matter\r\nworthy to be conveyed to posterity. I shall, therefore, give my best\r\ncare to, so to paint my thoughts, and give such a dress of the story\r\nof my life, that tho' I shall talk of the Great, the Least shall not\r\nfind cause of offence.\"\r\n\r\nThe occasion of this great man issuing so modest a proposal to the\r\npublic is involved in some mystery. It would seem that he determined\r\nto publish his own version of his adventures, in consequence of being\r\ndissatisfied with his son's sketch of them. John Taylor, Junior, was\r\nthen resident in Hatton Garden, living as an eye-doctor, and entered\r\ninto an arrangement with a publisher, without his father's consent, to\r\nwrite the Chevalier's biography. Affixed to the indecent pamphlet,\r\nwhich was the result of this agreement, are the following epistolary\r\nstatements:--\r\n\r\n\"MY SON,--If you should unguardedly have suffered your name at the\r\nhead of a work which must make us all contemptible, this must be\r\nprinted in it as the best apology for yourself and father:--\r\n\r\n                        \"TO THE PRINTER.\r\n\r\n                                           \"Oxford, Jan. 10, 1761.\r\n\r\n\"My dear and only son having respectfully represented to me that he\r\nhas composed a work, intitled _My Life and Adventures_, and requires\r\nmy consent for its publication, notwithstanding I am as yet a stranger\r\nto the composition, and consequently can be no judge of its merits, I\r\nam so well persuaded that my son is in every way incapable of saying\r\naught of his father but what must redound to his honour and\r\nreputation, and so perfectly convinced of the goodness of his heart,\r\nthat it does not seem possible I should err in my judgment, by giving\r\nmy consent to a publication of the said work. And as I have long been\r\nemployed in writing my own Life and Adventures, which will with all\r\nexpedition be published, 'twill hereafter be left with all due\r\nattention to the candid reader, whether the Life of the Father written\r\nby the son, or the Life of the Father written by himself, best\r\ndeserves approbation.\r\n\r\n                                             \"THE CHEVALIER TAYLOR,\r\n\r\n                    \"Opthalmiater, Pontifical, Imperial, and Royal.\r\n\r\n     \"* * * The above is a true copy of the letter my Father sent\r\n     me. All the answer I can make to the bills he sends about\r\n     the town and country is, that I have maintained my mother\r\n     these eight years, and do this at the present time; and\r\n     that, two years since, I was concerned for him, for which I\r\n     have paid near £200.\r\n\r\n                                       \"As witness my hand,\r\n                                         \"JOHN TAYLOR, _Oculist_.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Hatton Garden.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to say whether these differences were genuine, or\r\nonly feigned by the two quacks, in order to keep silly people\r\ngossiping about them. Certainly the accusations brought against the\r\nChevalier, that he had sponged on his son, and declined to support his\r\nwife, are rather grave ones to introduce into a make-believe quarrel.\r\nBut, on the other hand, when the Chevalier's autobiography appeared it\r\nwas prefaced with the following dedicatory letter to his son:--\r\n\r\n     \"MY DEAR SON,--Can I do ill when I address to you the story\r\n     of your father's life? Whose name can be so proper as your\r\n     own to be prefixed to a work of this kind? You who was born\r\n     to represent me living, when I shall cease to be--born to\r\n     pursue that most excellent and important profession to which\r\n     I have for so many years labored to be useful--born to\r\n     defend my cause and support my fame--may I not _presume_, my\r\n     son, that you will defend your father's cause? May I not\r\n     _affirm_ that you, my son, will support your father's fame?\r\n     After having this said, need I add more than remind\r\n     you--that, to a father, nothing can be so dear as a\r\n     deserving son--nor state so desirable as that of the man who\r\n     holds his successor, and knows him to be worthy. Be\r\n     prosperous. Be happy.\r\n\r\n                              \"I am, your affectionate Father,\r\n                                  \"THE CHEVALIER JOHN TAYLOR.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis unctuous address to \"my lion-hearted boy\" is equalled in drollery\r\nby many passages of the work itself, which (in the language of the\r\ntitle-page) \"contains all most worthy the attention of a\r\nTraveller--also a dissertation on the Art of Pleasing, with the most\r\ninteresting observations on the Force of Prejudice; numberless\r\nadventures, as well amongst nuns and friars as with persons in high\r\nlife; with a description of a great variety of the most admirable\r\nrelations, which, though told in his well-known peculiar manner, each\r\none is strictly true, and within the Chevalier's own observations and\r\nknowledge.\"\r\n\r\nApart from the bombast of his style, the Chevalier's \"well-known\r\npeculiar manner\" was remarkable for little besides tautology and a\r\nfantastic arrangement of words. In his orations, when he aimed at\r\nsublimity, he indulged in short sentences each of which commenced with\r\na genitive case followed by an accusative; after which came the verb\r\nsucceeded by the nominative. Thus, at such crises of grandiloquence,\r\ninstead of saying, \"I will lecture on the wonders of the eye,\" he\r\nwould invert the order to, \"Of the eye on the wonders lecture will I.\"\r\nBy doing this, he maintained that he surpassed the finest periods of\r\nTully! There is a letter in Nichols's \"Literary Anecdotes,\" in which a\r\nlecture given by this mountebank at Northampton is excellently\r\ndescribed. \"The doctor,\" says the writer, \"appeared dressed in black,\r\nwith a long light flowing ty'd wig; ascended a scaffold behind a large\r\ntable raised about two feet from the ground, and covered with an old\r\npiece of tapestry, on which was laid a dark-coloured cafoy\r\nchariot-seat with four black bunches (used upon hearses) tyed to the\r\ncorners for tassels, four large candles on each side of the cushion,\r\nand a quart decanter of drinking water, with a half-pint glass, to\r\nmoisten his mouth.\"\r\n\r\nThe fellow boasted that he was the author of forty-five works in\r\ndifferent languages. Once he had the audacity to challenge Johnson to\r\ntalk Latin with him. The doctor responded with a quotation from\r\nHorace, which the charlatan took to be the doctor's own composition.\r\n\"_He said a few words well enough_,\" Johnson said magnanimously when\r\nhe repeated the story to Boswell. \"Taylor,\" said the doctor, \"is the\r\nmost ignorant man I ever knew, but sprightly; Ward, the dullest.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Taylor, Junr., survived his father more than fifteen years, and\r\nto the last had a lucrative business in Hatton Garden. His father had\r\nbeen oculist to George the Second; but this post, on the death of the\r\nChevalier, he failed to obtain, it being given to a foreign _protégé_\r\nof the Duke of Bedford's. He made a great noise about the sufferings\r\nof the poor, and proposed to the different parishes of London to\r\nattend the paupers labouring under diseases of the eye at two guineas\r\na-year for each parish. He was an illiterate, vulgar, and licentious\r\nscoundrel; and yet when he died, on the 17th September, 1787, he was\r\nhonoured with a long memoir in the _Gentleman's Magazine_, as one\r\n\"whose philanthropy was exerted so fully as to class him with a Hanway\r\nor a Howard.\"\r\n\r\nIf an apology is needed for giving so much space, in a chapter devoted\r\nto the ladies, to the John Taylors, it must be grounded on the fact\r\nthat the Chevalier was the son of an honest widow woman who carried on\r\na respectable business, as an apothecary and doctress, at Norwich. In\r\nthis she resembled Mrs. Blood, the wife of the Colonel of that name,\r\nwho for years supported herself and son at Romford, by keeping an\r\napothecary's shop under the name of Weston. Colonel Blood was also\r\nhimself a member of the Faculty. For some time, whilst meditating his\r\n_grand coup_, he practised as a doctor in an obscure part of the City,\r\nunder the name of Ayliffe.\r\n\r\nTwo hundred years since the lady practitioners of medicine in the\r\nprovinces not seldom had working for them pupils and assistants of the\r\nopposite sex, and this usage was maintained in secluded districts till\r\na comparatively recent date. In Houghton's Collection, Nov. 15, 1695,\r\nis the following advertisement,--\"If any Apothecary's Widow that keeps\r\na shop in the country wants a journeyman that has lived 25 years for\r\nhimself in London, and has had the conversation of the eminent\r\nphysicians of the colledge, I can help to such an one.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nMESSENGER MONSEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmongst the celebrities of the medical profession, who have left no\r\nmemorial behind them more durable or better known than their wills in\r\nDoctors' Commons, was Messenger Monsey, the great-grandfather of our\r\nex-Chancellor, Lord Cranworth.\r\n\r\nWe do not know whether his Lordship is aware of his descent from the\r\neccentric physician. Possibly he is not, for the Monseys, though not\r\naltogether of a plebeian stock, were little calculated to throw éclat\r\nover the genealogy of a patrician house.\r\n\r\nMessenger Monsey, who used with a good deal of unnecessary noise to\r\ndeclare his contempt of the ancestral honours which he in reality\r\npossessed, loved to tell of the humble origin of his family. The first\r\nDuke of Leeds delighted in boasting of his lucky progenitor, Jack\r\nOsborn, the shop lad, who rescued his master's daughter from a watery\r\ngrave, in the Thames, and won her hand away from a host of noble\r\nsuitors, who wanted--literally, the young lady's _pin_-money. She was\r\nthe only child of a wealthy pinmaker carrying on his business on\r\nLondon Bridge, and the jolly old fellow, instead of disdaining to\r\nbestow his heiress on a 'prentice, exclaimed, \"Jack won her, and he\r\nshall wear her!\" Dr. Monsey, in the hey-day of his social fame, told\r\nhis friends that the first of his ancestors of any note was a baker,\r\nand a retail dealer in hops. At a critical point of this worthy man's\r\ncareer, when hops were \"down\" and feathers were \"up,\" to raise a small\r\nsum of money for immediate use he ripped open his beds, sold the\r\nfeathers, and stuffed the tick with unsaleable hops. Soon a change in\r\nthe market occurred, and once more operating on the couches used by\r\nhimself and children, he sold the hops at a profit, and bought back\r\nthe feathers. \"That's the way, sir, by which my family hopped from\r\nobscurity!\" the doctor would conclude.\r\n\r\nWe have reason for thinking that this ancestor was the physician's\r\ngreat-grandfather. As is usually found to be the case, where a man\r\nthinks lightly of the advantages of birth, Messenger was by no means\r\nof despicable extraction. His grandfather was a man of considerable\r\nproperty, and married Elizabeth Messenger, co-heir of Thomas\r\nMessenger, lord of Whitwell Manor, in the county of Norfolk, a\r\ngentleman by birth and position; and his father, the Rev. Robert\r\nMonsey, a Norfolk rector, married Mary, the daughter of Roger Clopton,\r\nrector of Downham. Of the antiquity and importance of the Cloptons\r\namongst the gentle families of England this is no place to speak; but\r\nfurther particulars relative to the Monsey pedigree may be found by\r\nthe curious in Bloomfield's \"History of Norfolk.\" On such a descent a\r\nCelt would persuade himself that he represented kings and rulers.\r\nMonsey, like Sydney Smith after him, preferred to cover the whole\r\nquestion with jolly, manly ridicule, and put it out of sight.\r\n\r\nMessenger Monsey was born in 1693, and received in early life an\r\nexcellent education; for though his father at the Revolution threw his\r\nlot in with the nonjurors, and forfeited his living, the worthy\r\nclergyman had a sufficient paternal estate to enable him to rear his\r\nonly child without any painful considerations of cost. After spending\r\nfive years at St. Mary's Hall, Cambridge, Messenger studied physic for\r\nsome time under Sir Benjamin Wrench, at Norwich. Starting on his own\r\naccount, he practised for a while at Bury St. Edmunds, in Suffolk, but\r\nwith little success. He worked hard, and yet never managed in that\r\nprosperous and beautiful country town to earn more than three hundred\r\nguineas in the same year. If we examined into the successes of medical\r\ncelebrities, we should find in a great majority of cases fortune was\r\nwon by the aspirant either annexing himself to, and gliding into the\r\nconfidence of, a powerful clique, or else by his being through some\r\nlucky accident thrown in the way of a patron. Monsey's rise was of the\r\nlatter sort. He was still at Bury, with nothing before him but the\r\nprospect of working all his days as a country doctor, when Lord\r\nGodolphin, son of Queen Anne's Lord Treasurer, and grandson of the\r\ngreat Duke of Marlborough, was seized, on the road to Newmarket, with\r\nan attack of apoplexy. Bury was the nearest point where medical\r\nassistance could be obtained. Monsey was summoned, and so fascinated\r\nhis patient with his conversational powers that his Lordship invited\r\nhim to London, and induced him to relinquish his country practice.\r\n\r\nFrom that time Monsey's fortune was made. He became to the Whigs very\r\nmuch what, in the previous generation, Radcliffe had been to the\r\nTories. Sir Robert Walpole genuinely loved him, seizing every\r\nopportunity to enjoy his society, and never doing anything for him;\r\nand Lord Chesterfield was amongst the most zealous trumpeters of his\r\nmedical skill. Lively, sagacious, well-read, and brutally sarcastic,\r\nhe had for a while a society reputation for wit scarcely inferior to\r\nSwift's; and he lived amongst men well able to judge of wit. Garrick\r\nand he were for many years intimate friends, until, in a contest of\r\njokes, each of the two brilliant men lost his temper, and they parted\r\nlike Roland and Sir Leoline--never to meet again. Garrick probably\r\nwould have kept his temper under any other form of ridicule, but he\r\nnever ceased to resent Monsey's reflection on his avarice to the\r\nBishop of Sodor and Man.\r\n\r\n\"Garrick is going to quit the stage,\" observed the Bishop.\r\n\r\n\"That he'll never do,\" answered Monsey, making use of a Norfolk\r\nproverb, \"so long as he knows a guinea is cross on one side and pile\r\non the other.\"\r\n\r\nThis speech was never forgiven. Lord Bath endeavoured to effect a\r\nreconciliation between the divided friends, but his amiable intention\r\nwas of no avail.\r\n\r\n\"I thank you,\" said Monsey; \"but why will your Lordship trouble\r\nyourself with the squabbles of a Merry Andrew and quack doctor?\"\r\n\r\nWhen the tragedian was on his death-bed, Monsey composed a satire on\r\nthe sick man, renewing the attack on his parsimony. Garrick's illness,\r\nhowever, terminating fatally, the doctor destroyed his verses, but\r\nsome scraps of them still remain to show their spirit and power. A\r\nconsultation of physicians was represented as being held over the\r\nactor:--\r\n\r\n    \"Seven wise physicians lately met,\r\n      To save a wretched sinner;\r\n    Come, Tom, said Jack, pray let's be quick,\r\n      Or I shall lose my dinner.\r\n          .      .      .      .      .\r\n    \"Some roared for rhubarb, jalap some,\r\n      And some cried out for Dover;\r\n    Lets give him something, each man said--\r\n      Why e'en let's give him--over.\"\r\n\r\nAfter much learned squabbling, one of the sages proposed to revive the\r\nsinking energies of the poor man by jingling guineas in his ears. The\r\nsuggestion was acted upon, when--\r\n\r\n    \"Soon as the fav'rite sound he heard,\r\n      One faint effort he try'd;\r\n    He op'd his eyes, he stretched his hands,\r\n      He made one grasp--and dy'd.\"\r\n\r\nThough, on the grave closing over his antagonist, Monsey suppressed\r\nthese lines, he continued to cherish an animosity to the object of\r\nthem. The spirit in which, out of respect to death, he drew a period\r\nto their quarrel, was much like that of the Irish peasant in the song,\r\nwho tells his ghostly adviser that he forgives Pat Malone with all his\r\nheart (supposing death should get the better of him)--but should he\r\nrecover, he means to pay the rascal off roundly. Sir Walter Scott\r\nsomewhere tells a story of a Highland chief, in his last moments\r\ndeclaring that he from the bottom of his heart forgave his old enemy,\r\nthe head of a hostile clan--and concluding this Christian avowal with\r\na final address to his son--\"But may all evil light upon ye, Ronald,\r\nif ye e'er forgie the heathen.\"\r\n\r\nThrough Lord Godolphin's interest, Monsey was appointed physician to\r\nChelsea College, on the death of Dr. Smart. For some time he continued\r\nto reside in St. James's: but on the death of his patron he moved to\r\nChelsea, and spent the last years of his life in retirement--and to a\r\ncertain extent banishment--from the great world. The hospital offices\r\nwere then filled by a set of low-born scoundrels, or discharged\r\nservants, whom the ministers of various Cabinets had had some reason\r\nof their own for providing for. The surgeon was that Mr. Ranby who\r\npositively died of rage because Henry Fielding's brother (Sir John)\r\nwould not punish a hackney coachman who had been guilty of the high\r\ntreason of--being injured and abused by the plaintiff. With this man\r\nMonsey had a tremendous quarrel; but though in the right, he had to\r\nsubmit to Ranby's powerful connections.\r\n\r\nThis affair did not soften his temper to the other functionaries of\r\nthe hospital with whom he had to associate at the hall table. His\r\nencounter with the venal elector who had been nominated to a Chelsea\r\nappointment is well known, though an account of it would hurt the\r\ndelicacy of these somewhat prudish pages. Of the doctor's insolence\r\nthe following is a good story:--\r\n\r\nA clergyman, who used to bore him with pompous and pedantic talk, was\r\narguing on some point with Monsey, when the latter exclaimed:--\r\n\r\n\"Sir, if you have faith in your opinion, will you venture a wager upon\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\n\"I could--but I won't,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" rejoined Monsey, \"you have very little wit, or very little\r\nmoney.\" The logic of this retort puts one in mind of the eccentric\r\nactor who, under somewhat similar circumstances, asked indignantly,\r\n\"Then, sir, how _dare_ you advance a statement in a public room which\r\nyou are not prepared to substantiate with a bet!\"\r\n\r\nMonsey was a Unitarian, and not at all backward to avow his creed. As\r\nhe was riding in Hyde Park with a Mr. Robinson, that gentleman, after\r\ndeploring the corrupt morals of the age, said, with very bad taste,\r\n\"But, Doctor, I talk with one who believes there is no God.\" \"And I,\"\r\nretorted Monsey, \"with one who believes there are three.\" Good Mr.\r\nRobinson was so horrified that he clapped spurs to his horse, galloped\r\noff, and never spoke to the doctor again.\r\n\r\nMonsey's Whiggism introduced him to high society, but not to lucrative\r\npractice. Sir Robert Walpole always extoled the merits of his \"Norfolk\r\nDoctor,\" but never advanced his interests. Instead of covering the\r\ngreat minister with adulation, Monsey treated him like an ordinary\r\nindividual, telling him when his jokes were poor, and not hesitating\r\nto worst him in argument. \"How happens it,\" asked Sir Robert, over his\r\nwine, \"that nobody will beat me at billiards, or contradict me, but\r\nDr. Monsey!\" \"Other people,\" put in the doctor, \"get places--I get a\r\ndinner and praise.\" The Duke of Grafton treated him even worse. His\r\nGrace staved off paying the physician his bill for attending him and\r\nhis family at Windsor, with promises of a place. When \"the little\r\nplace\" fell vacant, Monsey called on the duke, and reminded him of his\r\npromise. \"Ecod--ecod--ecod,\" was the answer, \"but the Chamberlain has\r\njust been here to tell me he has promised it to Jack ----.\" When the\r\ndisappointed applicant told the lord-chamberlain what had transpired,\r\nhis Lordship replied, \"Don't, for the world, tell his Grace; but\r\nbefore he knew I had promised it, here is a letter he sent me,\r\nsoliciting for _a third person_.\"\r\n\r\nAmongst the vagaries of this eccentric physician was the way in which\r\nhe extracted his own teeth. Round the tooth sentenced to be drawn he\r\nfastened securely a strong piece of catgut, to the opposite end of\r\nwhich he affixed a bullet. With this bullet and a full measure of\r\npowder a pistol was charged. On the trigger being pulled, the\r\noperation was performed effectually and speedily. The doctor could\r\nonly rarely prevail on his friends to permit him to remove their teeth\r\nby this original process. Once a gentleman who had agreed to try the\r\nnovelty, and had even allowed the apparatus to be adjusted, at the\r\nlast moment exclaimed, \"Stop, stop, I've changed my mind!\" \"But I\r\nhaven't, and you're a fool and a coward for your pains,\" answered the\r\ndoctor, pulling the trigger. In another instant the tooth was\r\nextracted, much to the timid patient's delight and astonishment.\r\n\r\nAt Chelsea, to the last, the doctor saw on friendly terms all the\r\ndistinguished medical men of his day. Cheselden, fonder of having his\r\nhorses admired than his professional skill extolled, as Pope and\r\nFreind knew, was his frequent visitor. He had also his loves. To Mrs.\r\nMontague, for many years, he presented a copy of verses on the\r\nanniversary of her birth-day. But after his quarrel with Garrick, he\r\nsaw but little of the lady, and was rarely, if ever, a visitor at her\r\nmagnificent house in Portman Square. Another of his flames, too, was\r\nMiss Berry, of whom the loss still seems to be recent. In his old age,\r\navarice--the very same failing he condemned so much in Garrick--developed\r\nitself in Monsey. In comparatively early life his mind was in a\r\nflighty state about money matters. For years he was a victim of that\r\nincredulity which makes the capitalist imagine a great and prosperous\r\ncountry to be the most insecure of all debtors. He preferred investing\r\nhis money in any wild speculation to confiding it to the safe custody\r\nof the funds. Even his ready cash he for long could not bring himself\r\nto trust in the hands of a banker. When he left town for a trip, he\r\nhad recourse to the most absurd schemes for the protection of his\r\nmoney. Before setting out, on one occasion, for a journey to Norfolk,\r\nincredulous with regard to cash-boxes and bureaus, he hid a\r\nconsiderable quantity of gold and notes in the fireplace of his study,\r\ncovering them up artistically with cinders and shavings. A month\r\nafterwards, returning (luckily a few days before he was expected), he\r\nfound his old house-maid preparing to entertain a few friends at tea\r\nin her master's room. The hospitable domestic was on the point of\r\nlighting the fire, and had just applied a candle to the doctor's\r\nnotes, when he entered the room, seized on a pail of water that\r\nchanced to be standing near, and, throwing its contents over the fuel\r\nand the old woman, extinguished the fire and her presence of mind at\r\nthe same time. Some of the notes, as it was, were injured, and the\r\nBank of England made objections to cashing them.\r\n\r\nTo the last Monsey acted by his own rules instead of by those of other\r\npeople. He lived to extreme old age, dying in his rooms in Chelsea\r\nCollege, on December 26th, 1788, in his ninety-fifth year; and his\r\nwill was as remarkable as any other feature of his career. To a young\r\nlady mentioned in it, with the most lavish encomiums on her wit,\r\ntaste, and elegance, was left an old battered snuff-box--not worth\r\nsixpence; and to another young lady, whom the testator says he\r\nintended to have enriched with a handsome legacy, he leaves the\r\ngratifying assurance that he changed his mind on finding her \"a pert,\r\nconceited minx.\" After inveighing against bishops, deans, and\r\nchapters, he left an annuity to two clergymen who had resigned their\r\npreferment on account of the Athanasian doctrine. He directed that his\r\nbody should not be insulted with any funeral ceremony, but should\r\nundergo dissection; after which, the \"remainder of my carcase\" (to use\r\nhis own words) \"may be put into a hole, or crammed into a box with\r\nholes, and thrown into the Thames.\" In obedience to this part of the\r\nwill, Mr. Forster, surgeon, of Union Court, Broad Street, dissected\r\nthe body, and delivered a lecture on it to the medical students in the\r\ntheatre of Guy's Hospital. The bulk of the doctor's fortune, amounting\r\nto about £16,000, was left to his only daughter for life, and after\r\nher demise, by a complicated entail, to her _female_ descendants. This\r\nonly child, Charlotte Monsey, married William Alexander, a\r\nlinen-draper in Cateaton Street, City, and had a numerous family. One\r\nof her daughters married the Rev. Edmund Rolfe, rector of Cockley\r\nClay, Norfolk, of which union Robert Monsey Rolfe, Baron Cranworth of\r\nCranworth, county of Norfolk, is the offspring.\r\n\r\nBefore making the above-named and final disposition of his body, the\r\nold man found vent for his ferocious cynicism and vulgar infidelity in\r\nthe following epitaph, which is scarcely less characteristic of the\r\nsociety in which the writer had lived, than it is of the writer\r\nhimself:--\r\n\r\n         \"MOUNSEY'S EPITAPH, WRITTEN BY HIMSELF.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Here lie my old bones; my vexation now ends;\r\n    I have lived much too long for myself and my friends.\r\n    As to churches and churchyards, which men may call holy,\r\n    'Tis a rank piece of priestcraft, and founded on folly.\r\n    What the next world may be never troubled my pate;\r\n    And be what it may, I beseech you, O fate,\r\n    When the bodies of millions rise up in a riot,\r\n    To let the old carcase of Mounsey be quiet.\"\r\n\r\nUnpleasant old scamp though he in many respects was, Monsey retains\r\neven at this day so firm a hold of the affections of all students who\r\nlike ferreting into the social history of the last century, that no\r\nchance letter of his writing is devoid of interest. The following\r\nspecimen of his epistolary style, addressed to his fair patient, the\r\naccomplished and celebrated Mrs. Montague (his acquaintance with which\r\nlady has already been alluded to), is transcribed from the original\r\nmanuscript in the possession of Dr. Diamond:--\r\n\r\n                                  \"4th of March, a minute past 12.\r\n     \"DEAR MADAME,\r\n\r\n     \"Now dead men's ghosts are getting out of their graves, and\r\n     there comes the ghost of a doctor in a white sheet to wait\r\n     upon you. Your Tokay is got into my head and your love into\r\n     my heart, and they both join to club their thanks for the\r\n     pleasantest day I have spent these seven years; and to my\r\n     comfort I find a man may be in love, and be happy, provided\r\n     he does not go to book for it. I could have trusted till\r\n     the morning to show my gratitude, but the Tokay wou'd have\r\n     evaporated, and then I might have had nothing to talk of but\r\n     an ache in my head and pain in my heart. Bacchus and Cupid\r\n     should always be together, for the young gentleman is very\r\n     apt to be silly when he's alone by himself; but when old\r\n     toss-pot is with him, if he pretends to fall a whining, he\r\n     hits him a cursed knock on the pate, and says: 'Drink about,\r\n     you....' 'No, Bacchus, don't be in a passion. Upon my soul\r\n     you have knocked out one of my eyes!' 'Eyes, ye scroundrel?\r\n     Why, you have never had one since you were born.... Apollo\r\n     would have couched you, but your mother said no; for then,\r\n     says she, \"he can never be blamed for his shot, any more\r\n     than the people that are shot at.\" She knew 'twould bring\r\n     grist to her mill; for what with those who pretended they\r\n     were in love and were not so, and those who were really so\r\n     and wouldn't own it, I shall find rantum scantum work at\r\n     Cyprus, Paphos, and Cythera. Some will come to acquire what\r\n     they never had, and others to get rid of what they find very\r\n     troublesome, and I shall mind none of 'em.' You see how the\r\n     goddess foresaw and predicted my misfortunes. She knew I was\r\n     a sincere votary, and that I was a martyr to her serene\r\n     influence. Then how could you use me so like an Hyrcanian\r\n     tygress, and be such an infidel to misery; that though I\r\n     hate you mortally, I wish you may feel but one poor\r\n     _half-quarter-of-an-hour_ before you slip your breath--how\r\n     shall I rejoice at your horrid agonies? _Nec enim lex\r\n     justior ulla Quam necis artifices arte perire suâ_--Remember\r\n     Me.\r\n\r\n     \"My ills have disturbed my brain, and the revival of old\r\n     ideas has set it a-boyling, that, till I have skim'd off\r\n     the froth, I can't pretend to say a word for myself; and by\r\n     the time I have cleared off the scum, the little grudge that\r\n     is left may be burnt to the bottom of the pot.\r\n\r\n    \"My mortal injuries have turned my mind,\r\n    And I could hate myself for being blind\r\n    But why should I thus rave of eyes and looks?\r\n    All I have felt is fancy--all from Books.\r\n    I stole my charmers from the cuts of Quarles,\r\n    And my dear Clarissa from the grand Sir Charles.\r\n    But if his mam or Cupid live above,\r\n    Who have revenge in store for injured love,\r\n    O Venus, send dire ruin on her head,\r\n    Strike the Destroyer, lay the Victress dead;\r\n    Kill the Triumphress, and avenge my wrong\r\n    In height of pomp, while she is warm and young.\r\n    Grant I may stand and dart her with my eyes\r\n    While in the fiercest pangs of life she lies,\r\n    Pursue her sportive soul and shoot it as it flies,\r\n    And cry with joy--There Montague lies flat,\r\n    Who wronged my passion with her barbarous Chat,\r\n    And was as cruel as a Cat to Rat,\r\n    As cat to rat--ay, ay, as cat to rat.\r\n    And when you got her up into your house,\r\n    Clinch yr, fair fist, and give her such a souse:\r\n    There, Hussy, take you that for all your Prate,\r\n    Your barbarous heart I do a-bo-mi-nate.\r\n    I'll take your part, my dearest faithful Doctor!\r\n    I've told my son, and see how he has mockt her!\r\n    He'll fire her soul and make her rant and rave;\r\n    See how she groans to be old Vulcan's slave.\r\n    The fatal bow is bent.

M.\"\r\n\r\nTruly did Dr. Messenger Monsey understand the art of writing a long\r\nletter about nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nAKENSIDE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were two Akensides--Akenside the poet, and Akenside the man; and\r\nof the _man_ Akenside there were numerous subdivisions. Remarkable as\r\na poet, he was even yet more noteworthy a private individual in his\r\nextreme inconsistency. No character is more commonplace than the one\r\nto which is ordinarily applied the word contradictory; but Akenside\r\nwas a curiosity from the extravagance in which this form of \"the\r\ncommonplace\" exhibited itself in his disposition and manners.\r\n\r\nBy turns he was placid, irritable, simple, affected, gracious,\r\nhaughty, magnanimous, mean, benevolent, harsh, and sometimes even\r\nbrutal. At times he was marked by a childlike docility, and at other\r\ntimes his vanity and arrogance displayed him almost as a madman. Of\r\nplebeian extraction, he was ashamed of his origin, and yet was\r\nthroughout life the champion of popular interests. Of his real\r\nhumanity there can be no doubt, and yet in his demeanour to the\r\nunfortunate creatures whom, in his capacity of a hospital-physician,\r\nhe had to attend, he was always supercilious, and often cruel.\r\n\r\nLike Byron, he was lame, one of his legs being shorter than the other;\r\nand of this personal disfigurement he was even more sensitive than was\r\nthe author of \"Childe Harold\" of his deformity. When his eye fell on\r\nit he would blush, for it reminded him of the ignoble condition in\r\nwhich he was born. His father was a butcher at Newcastle-upon-Tyne;\r\nand one of his cleavers, falling from the shop-block, had irremediably\r\ninjured the poet's foot, when he was still a little child.\r\n\r\nAkenside was not only the son of a butcher--but, worse still, a\r\nNonconformist butcher; and from an early period of his life he was\r\ndestined to be a sectarian minister. In his nineteenth year he was\r\nsent to Edinburgh to prosecute his theological studies, the expenses\r\nof this educational course being in part defrayed by the Dissenters'\r\nSociety. But he speedily discovered that he had made a wrong start,\r\nand persuaded his father to refund the money the Society had advanced,\r\nand to be himself at the cost of educating him as a physician. The\r\nhonest tradesman was a liberal and affectionate parent. Mark remained\r\nthree years at Edinburgh, a member of the Medical Society, and an\r\nindustrious student. On leaving Edinburgh he practised for a short\r\ntime as a surgeon at Newcastle; after which he went to Leyden, and\r\nhaving spent three months in that university took his degree of doctor\r\nof physic, May 16, 1744. At Leyden he became warmly attached to a\r\nfellow-student named Dyson; and wonderful to be related, the two\r\nfriends, notwithstanding one was under heavy pecuniary obligations to\r\nthe other, and they were very unlike each other in some of their\r\nprincipal characteristics, played the part of Pylades and Orestes,\r\neven into the Valley of Death. Akenside was poor, ardent, and of a\r\nnervous, poetic temperament. Dyson was rich, sober, and\r\nmatter-of-fact, a prudent place-holder. He rose to be clerk of the\r\nHouse of Commons, and a Lord of the Treasury; but the atmosphere of\r\npolitical circles and the excitement of public life never caused his\r\nheart to forget its early attachment. Whilst the poet lived Dyson was\r\nhis munificent patron, and when death had stepped in between them, his\r\nliterary executor. Indeed, he allowed him for years no less a sum than\r\n£300 per annum.\r\n\r\nAkenside was never very successful as a physician, although he\r\nthoroughly understood his profession, and in some important\r\nparticulars advanced its science. Dyson introduced him into good\r\nsociety, and recommended him to all his friends; but the greatest\r\nincome Akenside ever made was most probably less than what he obtained\r\nfrom his friend's generosity. Still, he must have earned something,\r\nfor he managed to keep a carriage and pair of horses; and £300 per\r\nannum, although a hundred years ago that sum went nearly twice as far\r\nas it would now, could not have supported the equipage. His want of\r\npatients can easily be accounted for. He was a vain, tempestuous,\r\ncrotchety little man, little qualified to override the prejudices\r\nwhich vulgar and ignorant people cherish against lawyers and\r\nphysicians who have capacity and energy enough to distinguish\r\nthemselves in any way out of the ordinary track of their professional\r\nduties.\r\n\r\nHe was admitted, by mandamus, to a doctor's degree at Cambridge; and\r\nbecame a fellow of the Royal Society, and a fellow of the Royal\r\nCollege of Physicians. He tried his luck at Northampton, and found he\r\nwas not needed there; he became an inhabitant of Hampstead, but failed\r\nto ingratiate himself with the opulent gentry who in those days\r\nresided in that suburb; and lastly fixed himself in Bloomsbury Square\r\n(ætat. 27), where he resided till his death. After some delay, he\r\nbecame a physician of St. Thomas's Hospital, and an assistant\r\nphysician of Christ's Hospital--read the Gulstonian Lectures before\r\nthe College of Physicians, in 1755--and was also Krohnian Lecturer. In\r\nspeeches and papers to learned societies, and to various medical\r\ntreatises, amongst which may be mentioned his \"De Dysentariâ\r\nCommentarius,\" he tried to wheedle himself into practice. But his\r\nefforts were of no avail. Sir John Hawkins, in his absurd Life of Dr.\r\nJohnson, tells a good story of Saxby's rudeness to the author of the\r\n\"Pleasures of Imagination.\" Saxby was a custom-house clerk, and made\r\nhimself liked in society by saying the rude things which other people\r\nhad the benevolence to feel, but lacked the hardihood to utter. One\r\nevening, at a party, Akenside argued, with much warmth and more\r\ntediousness, that physicians were better and wiser men than the world\r\nordinarily thought.\r\n\r\n\"Doctor,\" said Saxby, \"after all you have said, my opinion of the\r\nprofession is this: the ancients endeavoured to make it a science, and\r\nfailed; and the moderns to make it a trade, and succeeded.\"\r\n\r\nHe was not liked at St. Thomas's Hospital. The gentle Lettsom, whose\r\nmild poetic nature had surrounded the author of \"The Pleasures of\r\nImagination\" with a halo of romantic interest, when he entered himself\r\na student of that school, was shocked at finding the idol of his\r\nadmiration so irritable and unkindly a man. He was, according to\r\nLettsom's reminiscences, thin and pale, and of a strumous countenance.\r\nHis injured leg was lengthened by a false heel. In dress he was\r\nscrupulously neat and delicate, always having on his head a\r\nwell-powdered white wig, and by his side a long sword. Any want of\r\nrespect to him threw him into a fit of anger. One amongst the students\r\nwho accompanied him on a certain occasion round the wards spat on the\r\nfloor behind the physician. Akenside turned sharply on his heel, and\r\ndemanded who it was that dared to spit in his face. To the poor women\r\nwho applied to him for medical advice he exhibited his dislike in the\r\nmost offensive and cruel manner. The students who watched him closely,\r\nand knew the severe disappointment his affections had suffered in\r\nearly life, whispered to the novice that the poet-physician's\r\nmoroseness to his female patients was a consequence of his having felt\r\nthe goads of despised love. The fastidiousness of the little fellow at\r\nhaving to come so closely in contact with the vulgar rabble, induced\r\nhim sometimes to make the stronger patients precede him with brooms\r\nand clear a way for him through the crowd of diseased wretches. Bravo,\r\nmy butcher's boy! This story of Akenside and his lictors, pushing back\r\nthe unsightly mob of lepers, ought to be read side by side with that\r\nof the proud Duke of Somerset, who, when on a journey, used to send\r\noutriders before him to clear the roads, and prevent vulgar eyes from\r\nlooking at him.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion Akenside ordered an unfortunate male patient of St.\r\nThomas's to take boluses of bark. The poor fellow complained that he\r\ncould not swallow them. Akenside was so incensed at the man's\r\npresuming to have an opinion on the subject, that he ordered him to be\r\nturned out of the hospital, saying, \"He shall not die under my care.\"\r\nA man who would treat his _poor_ patients in this way did not deserve\r\nto have any _rich_ ones. These excesses of folly and brutality,\r\nhowever, ere long reached the ears of honest Richard Chester, one of\r\nthe governors, and that good fellow gave the doctor a good scolding,\r\nroundly telling him, \"Know, thou art a servant of this charity.\"\r\n\r\nAkenside's self-love received a more humorous stab than the poke\r\nadministered by Richard Chester's blunt cudgel, from Mr. Baker, one of\r\nthe surgeons at St. Thomas's. To appreciate the full force of the\r\nstory, the reader must recollect that the jealousy, which still exists\r\nbetween the two branches of the medical profession, was a century\r\nsince so violent that even considerations of interest failed in some\r\ncases to induce eminent surgeons and physicians to act together. One\r\nof Baker's sons was the victim of epilepsy, and frequent fits had\r\nimpaired his faculties. Baker was naturally acutely sensitive of his\r\nchild's misfortune, and when Akenside had the bad taste to ask to what\r\nstudy the afflicted lad intended to apply, the father answered, \"I\r\nfind he is not capable of making a surgeon, so I have sent him to\r\nEdinburgh to make a physician of him.\" Akenside felt this sarcasm so\r\nmuch, that he for a long time afterward refused to hold any\r\nintercourse with Baker.\r\n\r\nBut Akenside had many excuses for his irritability. He was very\r\nambitious, and failed to achieve that success which the possession of\r\ngreat powers warranted him in regarding as his due. It was said of\r\nGarth that no physician understood his art more, or his trade less!\r\nand this, as Mr. Bucke, in his beautiful \"Life of Arkenside,\" remarks,\r\nwas equally true of the doctor of St. Thomas's. He had a thirst for\r\nhuman praise and worldly success, and a temperament that caused him,\r\nnotwithstanding all his sarcasms against love, to estimate at their\r\nfull worth the joys of married life; yet he lived all his days a poor\r\nman, and died a bachelor. Other griefs also contributed to sour his\r\ntemper. His lot was cast in times that could not justly appreciate his\r\nliterary excellences. His sincere admiration of classic literature and\r\nart and manners was regarded by the coarse herd of rich and stupid\r\nLondoners as so perfectly ridiculous, that when Smollett had the bad\r\ntaste to introduce him into _Peregrine Pickle_, as the physician who\r\ngives a dinner after the manner of the ancients, the applause was\r\ngeneral, and every city tradesman, with scholarship enough to read the\r\nnovel, had a laugh at the expense of a man who has some claims to be\r\nregarded as the greatest literary genius of his time. The polished and\r\nrefined circles of English life paid homage to his genius, but even in\r\nthem he failed to meet with the cordial recognition he deserved.\r\nJohnson, though he placed him above Gray and Mason, did not do him\r\njustice. Boswell didn't see much in him. Horace Walpole differed from\r\nthe friend who asked him to admire the \"Pleasures of Imagination.\"\r\nThe poets and wits of his own time had a high respect for his critical\r\nopinion, and admitted the excellence of his poetry--but almost\r\ninvariably with some qualification. And Akenside was one who thirsted\r\nfor the complete assent of the applauding world. He died after a brief\r\nillness in his forty-ninth year, on the 23rd of June, 1770; and we\r\ndoubt not, when the Angel of Death touched him, the heart that ceased\r\nto beat was one that had known much sorrow.\r\n\r\nAkenside's poetical career was one of unfulfilled promise. At the age\r\nof twenty-three he had written \"The Pleasures of the Imagination.\"\r\nPope was so struck with the merits of the poem, that when Dodsley\r\nconsulted him about the price set on it by the author (£120), he told\r\nhim to make no niggardly offer, for it was the work of no every-day\r\nwriter. But he never produced another great work. Impressed with the\r\nimperfections of his achievement, he occupied himself with incessantly\r\ntouching and re-touching it up, till he came to the unwise\r\ndetermination of re-writing it. He did not live to accomplish this\r\nsuicidal task; but the portion of it which came to the public was\r\ninferior to the original poem, both in power and art.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nLETTSOM.\r\n\r\n\r\nHigh amongst literary, and higher yet amongst benevolent, physicians\r\nmust be ranked John Coakley Lettsom, formerly president of the\r\nPhilosophical Society of London. A West Indian, and the son of a\r\nplanter, he was born on one of his father's little islands, Van Dyke,\r\nnear Tortola, in the year 1744. Though bred a Quaker, he kept his\r\nheart so free from sectarianism, and his life so entirely void of the\r\nformality and puritanic asceticism of the Friends, that his ordinary\r\nacquaintance marvelled at his continuing to wear the costume of the\r\nbrotherhood. At six years of age he was sent to England for education,\r\nbeing for that purpose confided to the protection of Mr. Fothergill,\r\nof Warrington, a Quaker minister, and younger brother of Dr. John\r\nFothergill. After receiving a poor preparatory education, he was\r\napprenticed to a Yorkshire apothecary, named Sutcliffe, who, by\r\nindustry and intelligence, had raised himself from the position of a\r\nweaver to that of the first medical practitioner of Settle. In the\r\nlast century a West Indian was, to the inhabitants of a provincial\r\ndistrict, a rare curiosity; and Sutcliffe's surgery, on the day that\r\nLettsom entered it in his fifteenth year, was surrounded by a dense\r\ncrowd of gaping rustics, anxious to see a young gentleman accustomed\r\nto walk on his head. This extraordinary demonstration of curiosity was\r\nowing to the merry humour of Sutcliffe's senior apprentice, who had\r\ninformed the people that the new pupil, who would soon join him, came\r\nfrom a country where the feet of the inhabitants were placed in an\r\nexactly opposite direction to those of Englishmen.\r\n\r\nSutcliffe did not find his new apprentice a very handy one. \"Thou\r\nmayest make a physician, but I think not a good apothecary,\" the old\r\nman was in the habit of saying; and the prediction in due course\r\nturned out a correct one. Having served an apprenticeship of five\r\nyears, and walked for two the wards of St. Thomas's Hospital, where\r\nAkenside was a physician, conspicuous for supercilious manner and want\r\nof feeling, Lettsom returned to the West Indies, and settled as a\r\nmedical practitioner in Tortola. He practised there only five months,\r\nearning in that time the astonishing sum of £2000; when, ambitious of\r\nachieving a high professional position, he returned to Europe, visited\r\nthe medical schools of Paris and Edinburgh, took his degree of M.D. at\r\nLeyden on the 20th of June, 1769, was admitted a licentiate of the\r\nRoyal College of Physicians of London in the same year, and in 1770\r\nwas elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries.\r\n\r\nFrom this period till his death, in 1815 (Nov. 20), he was one of the\r\nmost prominent figures in the scientific world of London. As a\r\nphysician he was a most fortunate man; for without any high reputation\r\nfor professional acquirements, and with the exact reverse of a good\r\npreliminary education, he made a larger income than any other\r\nphysician of the same time. Dr. John Fothergill never made more than\r\n£5000 in one year; but Lettsom earned £3600 in 1783--£3900 in\r\n1784--£4015 in 1785-and £4500 in 1786. After that period his practice\r\nrapidly increased, so that in some years his receipts were as much as\r\n£12,000. But although he pocketed such large sums, half his labours\r\nwere entirely gratuitous. Necessitous clergymen and literary men he\r\ninvariably attended with unusual solicitude and attention, but without\r\never taking a fee for his services. Indeed, generosity was the ruling\r\nfeature of his life. Although he burdened himself with the public\r\nbusiness of his profession, was so incessantly on the move from one\r\npatient to another that he habitually knocked up three pairs of horses\r\na-day, and had always some literary work or other upon his desk, he\r\nnevertheless found time to do an amount of labour, in establishing\r\ncharitable institutions and visiting the indigent sick, that would by\r\nitself have made a reputation for an ordinary person.\r\n\r\nTo give the mere list of his separate benevolent services would be to\r\nwrite a book about them. The General Dispensary, the Finsbury\r\nDispensary, the Surrey Dispensary, and the Margate Sea-bathing\r\nInfirmary, originated in his exertions; and he was one of the first\r\nprojectors of--the Philanthropic Society, St. Georges-in-the-Fields,\r\nfor the Prevention of Crimes, and the Reform of the Criminal Poor; the\r\nSociety for the Discharge and Relief of Persons Imprisoned for Small\r\nDebts; the Asylum for the Indigent Deaf and Dumb; the Institution for\r\nthe Relief and Employment of the Indigent Blind; and the Royal Humane\r\nSociety, for the recovery of the apparently drowned or dead. And year\r\nby year his pen sent forth some publication or other to promote the\r\nwelfare of the poor, and succour the afflicted. Of course there were\r\ncrowds of clever spectators of the world's work, who smiled as the\r\ndoctor's carriage passed them in the streets, and said he was a deuced\r\nclever fellow to make ten thousand a-year so easily; and that, after\r\nall, philanthropy was not a bad trade. But Lettsom was no calculating\r\nhumanitarian, with a tongue discoursing eloquently on the sufferings\r\nof mankind, and an eye on the sharp look-out for his own interest.\r\nWhat he was before the full stare of the world, that he was also in\r\nhis own secret heart, and those private ways into which hypocrisy\r\ncannot enter. At the outset of his life, when only twenty-three years\r\nold, he liberated his slaves--although they constituted almost his\r\nentire worldly wealth, and he was anxious to achieve distinction in a\r\nprofession that offers peculiar difficulties to needy aspirants. And\r\nwhen his career was drawing to a close, he had to part with his\r\nbeloved countryseat because he had impoverished himself by lavish\r\ngenerosity to the unfortunate.\r\n\r\nThere was no sanctimonious affectation in the man. He wore a drab coat\r\nand gaiters, and made the Quaker's use of _Thou_ and _Thee_; but he\r\nheld himself altogether apart from the prejudices of his sect. A poet\r\nhimself of some respectability, he delighted in every variety of\r\nliterature, and was ready to shake any man by the hand--Jew or\r\nGentile. He liked pictures and works of sculpture, and spent large\r\nsums upon them; into the various scientific movements of the time he\r\nthrew himself with all the energy of his nature; and he disbursed a\r\nfortune in surrounding himself at Camberwell with plants from the\r\ntropics. He liked good wine, but never partook of it to excess,\r\nalthough his enemies were ready to suggest that he was always glad to\r\navail himself of an excuse for getting intoxicated. And he was such a\r\ndevoted admirer of the fair sex, that the jealous swarm of needy men\r\nwho envied him his prosperity, had some countenance for their slander\r\nthat he was a Quaker debauchee. He married young, and his wife\r\noutlived him; but as a husband he was as faithful as he proved in\r\nevery other relation of life.\r\n\r\nSaturday was the day he devoted to entertaining his friends at Grove\r\nHill, Camberwell; and rare parties there gathered round\r\nhim--celebrities from every region of the civilized world, and the\r\nbest \"good fellows\" of London. Boswell was one of his most frequent\r\nguests, and, in an ode to Charles Dilly, celebrated the beauties of\r\nthe physician's seat and his humane disposition:--\r\n\r\n    \"My cordial Friend, still prompt to lend\r\n      Your cash when I have need on't;\r\n    We both must bear our load of care--\r\n      At least we talk and read on't.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Yet are we gay in ev'ry way,\r\n      Not minding where the joke lie;\r\n    On Saturday at bowls we play\r\n      At Camberwell with Coakley.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Methinks you laugh to hear but half\r\n      The name of Dr. Lettsom:\r\n    From him of good--talk, liquors, food--\r\n      His guests will always get some.\"\r\n\r\n    \"And guests has he, in ev'ry degree,\r\n      Of decent estimation:\r\n    His liberal mind holds all mankind\r\n      As an extended Nation.\r\n\r\n    \"O'er Lettsom's cheer we've met a peer--\r\n      A peer--no less than Lansdowne!\r\n    Of whom each dull and envious skull\r\n      Absurdly cries--'The man's down!'\r\n\r\n    \"Down do they say? How then, I pray,\r\n      His king and country prize him!\r\n    Through the whole world known, his peace alone\r\n      Is sure t' immortalize him.\r\n\r\n    \"Lettsom we view a _Quaker_ true,\r\n      'Tis clear he's so in one sense:\r\n    His _spirit_, strong, and ever young,\r\n      Refutes pert Priestley's nonsense.\r\n\r\n    \"In fossils he is deep, we see;\r\n      Nor knows Beasts, Fishes, Birds ill;\r\n    With plants not few, some from Pelew,\r\n      And wondrous Mangel Wurzel!\r\n\r\n    \"West India bred, warm heart, cool head,\r\n      The city's first physician;\r\n    By schemes humane--want, sickness, pain,\r\n      To aid in his ambition.\r\n\r\n    \"From terrace high he feasts his eye,\r\n      When practice grants a furlough;\r\n    And, while it roves o'er Dulwich groves,\r\n      Looks down--even upon Thurlow.\"\r\n\r\nThe concluding line is an allusion to the Lord Chancellor's residence\r\nat Dulwich.\r\n\r\nIn person, Lettsom was tall and thin--indeed, almost attenuated: his\r\nface was deeply lined, indicating firmness quite as much as\r\nbenevolence; and his complexion was of a dark yellow hue. His\r\neccentricities were numerous. Like the founder of his sect, he would\r\nnot allow even respect for royalty to make an alteration in his\r\ncostume which his conscience did not approve; and George III., who\r\nentertained a warm regard for him, allowed him to appear at Court in\r\nthe ordinary Quaker garb, and to kiss his hand, though he had neither\r\npowder on his head, nor a sword by his side. Lettsom responded to his\r\nsovereign's courtesy by presenting him with some rare and\r\nunpurchasable medals.\r\n\r\nThough his writings show him to have been an enlightened physician for\r\nhis time, his system of practice was not of course free from the\r\nviolent measures which were universally believed in during the last\r\ncentury. He used to say of himself,\r\n\r\n            \"When patients sick to me apply,\r\n              I physics, bleeds and sweats 'em;\r\n            Then--if they choose to die,\r\n    What's that to me--I lets 'em.\"--(I. Lettsom.)\r\n\r\nBut his prescriptions were not invariably of a kind calculated to\r\ndepress the system of his patient. On one occasion an old American\r\nmerchant, who had been ruined by the rupture between the colonies and\r\nthe mother country, requested his attendance and professional advice.\r\nThe unfortunate man was seventy-four years of age, and bowed down with\r\nthe weight of his calamities.\r\n\r\n\"Those trees, doctor,\" said the sick man, looking out of his bed-room\r\nwindow over his lawn, \"I planted, and have lived to see some of them\r\ntoo old to bear fruit; they are part of my family: and my children,\r\nstill dearer to me, must quit this residence, which was the delight of\r\nmy youth, and the hope of my old age.\"\r\n\r\nThe Quaker physician was deeply affected by these pathetic words, and\r\nthe impressive tone with which they were uttered. He spoke a few words\r\nof comfort, and quitted the room, leaving on the table as his\r\nprescription--a cheque for a large sum of money. Nor did his goodness\r\nend there. He purchased the house of his patient's creditors, and\r\npresented it to him for life.\r\n\r\nAs Lettsom was travelling in the neighbourhood of London, a highwayman\r\nstopped his carriage, and, putting a pistol into the window, demanded\r\nhim to surrender his money. The faltering voice and hesitation of the\r\nrobber showed that he had only recently taken to his perilous\r\nvocation, and his appearance showed him to be a young man who had\r\nmoved in the gentle ranks of life. Lettsom quickly responded that he\r\nwas sorry to see such a well-looking young man pursuing a course which\r\nwould inevitably bring him to ruin; that he would _give_ him freely\r\nall the money he had about him, and would try to put him in a better\r\nway of life, if he liked to call on him in the course of a few days.\r\nAs the doctor said this, he gave his card to the young man, who turned\r\nout to be another victim of the American war. He had only made one\r\nsimilar attempt on the road before, and had been driven to lawless\r\naction by unexpected pennilessness. Lettsom endeavoured in vain to\r\nprocure aid for his _protégé_ from the commissioners for relieving the\r\nAmerican sufferers; but eventually the Queen, interested in the young\r\nman's case, presented him with a commission in the army; and in a\r\nbrief military career, that was cut short by yellow fever in the West\r\nIndies, he distinguished himself so much that his name appeared twice\r\nin the _Gazette_.\r\n\r\nOn one of his benevolent excursions the doctor found his way into the\r\nsqualid garret of a poor woman who had seen better days. With the\r\nlanguage and deportment of a lady she begged the physician to give\r\nher a prescription. After inquiring carefully into her case, he wrote\r\non a slip of paper to the overseers of the parish--\r\n\r\n\"A shilling per diem for Mrs Moreton. Money, not physic, will cure\r\nher.\r\n                                                    \"LETTSOM.\"\r\n\r\nOf all Lettsom's numerous works, including his contributions to the\r\n_Gentleman's Magazine_, under the signature of \"Mottles,\" the anagram\r\nof his own name, the one most known to the general reader, is the\r\n\"History of some of the Effects of Hard Drinking.\" It concludes with a\r\nscale of Temperance and Intemperance, in imitation of a thermometer.\r\nTo each of the two conditions seventy degrees are allotted. Against\r\nthe seventieth (or highest) degree of Temperance is marked \"Water,\"\r\nunder which, at distances of ten degrees, follow \"Milk-and-Water,\"\r\n\"Small Beer,\" \"Cyder and Perry,\" \"Wine,\" \"Porter,\" \"Strong Beer.\" The\r\ntenth degree of Intemperance is \"Punch\"; the twentieth, \"Toddy and\r\nCrank\"; the thirtieth, \"Grog and Brandy and Water\"; the fortieth,\r\n\"Flip and Shrub\"; the fiftieth, \"Bitters infused in Spirits,\r\nUsquebaugh, Hysteric Water\"; the sixtieth, \"Gin, Aniseed, Brandy, Rum,\r\nand Whisky,\" in the morning; the seventieth, like the sixtieth, only\r\ntaken day and night. Then follow, in tabular order, the vices,\r\ndiseases, and punishments of the different stages of Intemperance. The\r\nmere enumeration of them ought to keep the most confirmed toper sober\r\nfor the rest of his days:--\r\n\r\n\"_Vices._--Idleness, Peevishness, Quarrelling, Fighting, Lying,\r\nSwearing, Obscenity, Swindling, Perjury, Burglary, Murder, Suicide.\r\n\r\n\"_Diseases._--Sickness, Tremors of the Hands in the Morning,\r\nBloatedness, Inflamed Eyes, Red Nose and Face, Sore and Swelled Legs,\r\nJaundice, Pains in the Limbs, Dropsy, Epilepsy, Melancholy, Madness,\r\nPalsy, Apoplexy, Death.\r\n\r\n\"_Punishments._--Debt, Black Eyes, Rags, Hunger, Hospital, Poor-house,\r\nJail, Whipping, the Hulks, Botany Bay, Gallows!\"\r\n\r\nThis reads like Hogarth's Gin Lane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nA FEW MORE QUACKS.\r\n\r\n     The term quack is applicable to all who, by pompous\r\n     pretences, mean insinuations, and indirect promises,\r\n     endeavour to obtain that confidence to which neither\r\n     education, merit, nor experience entitles them.--_Samuel\r\n     Parr's Definition._\r\n\r\n\r\nOf London's modern quacks, one of the most daring was James Graham, M.\r\nD., of Edinburgh, who introduced into England the juggleries of\r\nMesmer, profiting by them in this country scarcely less than his\r\nmaster did on the Continent. His brother married Catherine Macaulay,\r\nthe author of the immortal History of England, which no one now-a-days\r\nreads; the admired of Horace Walpole; the lady whose statue during her\r\nlife-time, was erected in the chancel of the church of St. Stephen's,\r\nWalbrook. Graham's sister was married to Dr. Arnold, of Leicester, the\r\nauthor of a valuable book on Insanity.\r\n\r\nWith a little intellect and more knavery, Dr. Graham ran a course very\r\nsimilar to Mesmer. Emerging from obscurity in or about the year 1780,\r\nhe established himself in a spacious mansion in the Royal Terrace,\r\nAdelphi, overlooking the Thames, and midway between the Blackfriars\r\nand Westminster Bridges. The river front of the house was ornamented\r\nwith classic pillars; and inscribed over the principal entrance, in\r\ngilt letters on a white compartment, was \"Templum Æsculapio Sacrum.\"\r\nThe \"Temple of Health,\" as it was usually spoken of in London, quickly\r\nbecame a place of fashionable resort. Its spacious rooms were supplied\r\nwith furniture made to be stared at--sphynxes, dragons breathing\r\nflame, marble statues, paintings, medico-electric apparatus, rich\r\ncurtains and draperies, stained glass windows, stands of armour,\r\nimmense pillars and globes of glass, and remarkably arranged plates of\r\nburnished steel. Luxurious couches were arranged in the recesses of\r\nthe apartments, whereon languid visitors were invited to rest; whilst\r\nthe senses were fascinated with strains of gentle music, and the\r\nperfumes of spices burnt in swinging censers. The most sacred shrine\r\nof the edifice stood in the centre of \"The Great Apollo Apartment,\"\r\ndescribed by the magician in the following terms:--\"This room is\r\nupwards of thirty feet long, by twenty wide, and full fifteen feet\r\nhigh in the ceiling; on entering which, words can convey no adequate\r\nidea of the astonishment and awful sublimity which seizes the mind of\r\nevery spectator. The first object which strikes the eye, astonishes,\r\nexpands, and ennobles the soul of the beholder, is a magnificent\r\ntemple, sacred to health, and dedicated to Apollo. In this tremendous\r\nedifice are combined or singly dispensed the irresistible and\r\nsalubrious influences of electricity, or the elementary fire, air, and\r\nmagnetism; three of the greatest of those agents of universal\r\nprinciples, which, pervading all created being and substances that we\r\nare acquainted with, connect, animate, and keep together all\r\nnature;--or, in other words, principles which constitute, as it were,\r\nthe various faculties of the material soul of the universe: _the\r\nEternally Supreme Jehovah Himself_ being the essential source--the\r\nLife of that Life--the Agent of those Agents--the Soul of that\r\nSoul--the All-creating, all-sustaining, all-blessing God!--not of this\r\nworld alone--not of the other still greater worlds which we know\r\ncompose our solar system! Not the creator, the soul, the preserver of\r\nthis world alone--or of any of those which we have seen roll with\r\nuninterrupted harmony for so many thousands of years!--not the God of\r\nthe millions of myriads of worlds, of systems, and of various ranks\r\nand orders of beings and intelligences which probably compose the\r\naggregate of the grand, the vast, the incomprehensible system of the\r\nuniverse!--but the eternal, infinitely wise, and infinitely powerful,\r\ninfinitely good God of the whole--the Great Sun of the Universe!\"\r\n\r\nThis blasphemy was regarded in Bond Street and Mayfair as inspired\r\nwisdom. It was held to be wicked not to believe in Dr. Graham. The\r\n\"Temple\" was crowded with the noble and wealthy; and Graham, mingling\r\nthe madness of a religious enthusiast with the craft of a charlatan,\r\npreached to his visitors and prayed over them with the zeal of Joanna\r\nSouthcote. He composed a form of prayer to be used in the Temple,\r\ncalled \"the Christian's Universal Prayer,\" a long rigmarole of\r\nspasmodic nonsense, to the printed edition of which the author affixed\r\nthe following note: \"The first idea of writing this prayer was\r\nsuggested by hearing, one evening, the celebrated Mr Fischer play on\r\nthe hautboy, with inimitable sweetness, _his long-winded_ variations\r\non some old tunes. I was desirous to know what effect that would have\r\nwhen extended to literary composition. I made the experiment as soon\r\nas I got home, on the Lord's Prayer, and wrote the following in bed,\r\nbefore morning:\"\r\n\r\nAbout the \"Temple of Health\" there are a few other interesting\r\nparticulars extant. The woman who officiated in the \"Sanctum\r\nSanctorum\" was the fair and frail Emma--in due course to be the wife\r\nof Sir William Hamilton, and the goddess of Nelson. The charges for\r\nconsulting the oracle, or a mere admission in the Temple, were thus\r\narranged. \"The nobility, gentry, and others, who apply through the\r\nday, viz., from ten to six, must pay a guinea the first consultation,\r\nand half a guinea every time after. No person whomsoever, even\r\npersonages of the first rank, need expect to be attended at their own\r\nhouses, unless confined to bed by sickness, or to their room through\r\nextreme weakness; and from those whom he attends at their houses two\r\nguineas each visit is expected. Dr Graham, for reasons of the highest\r\nimportance to the public as well as to himself, has a chymical\r\nlaboratory and a great medicinal cabinet in his own house; and in the\r\nabove fixed fees either at home or abroad, every expense attending his\r\nadvice, medicines, applications, and operations, and _influences_, are\r\nincluded--a few tedious, complex, and expensive operations in the\r\nGreat Apollo apartment only excepted.\"\r\n\r\nBut the humour of the man culminated when he bethought himself of\r\ndisplaying the crutches and spectacles of restored patients, as\r\ntrophies of his victories over disease. \"Over the doors of the\r\nprincipal rooms, under the vaulted compartments of the ceiling, and\r\nin each side of the centre arches of the hall, are placed\r\nwalking-sticks, ear-trumpets, visual glasses, crutches, &c., left, and\r\nhere placed as most honourable trophies, by deaf, weak, paralytic, and\r\nemaciated persons, cripples, &c., who, being cured, have happily no\r\nlonger need of such assistances.\"\r\n\r\nAmongst the furniture of the \"Temple of Health\" was a celestial bed,\r\nprovided with costly draperies, and standing on glass legs. Married\r\ncouples, who slept on this couch, were sure of being blessed with a\r\nbeautiful progeny. For its use £100 per night was demanded, and\r\nnumerous persons of rank were foolish enough to comply with the terms.\r\nBesides his celestial bed and magnetic tomfooleries, Graham vended an\r\n\"Elixir of Life,\" and subsequently recommended and superintended\r\nearth-bathing. Any one who took the elixir might live as long as he\r\nwished. For a constant supply of so valuable a medicine, £1000, paid\r\nin advance, was the demand. More than one nobleman paid that sum. The\r\nDuchess of Devonshire patronized Graham, as she did every other quack\r\nwho came in her way; and her folly was countenanced by Lady Spencer,\r\nLady Clermont, the Comtesse de Polignac, and the Comtesse de Chalon.\r\n\r\nOf all Dr. Graham's numerous writings one of the most ridiculous is \"A\r\nclear, full, and faithful Portraiture, or Description, and ardent\r\nRecommendation of a certain most beautiful and spotless Virgin\r\nPrincess, of Imperial descent! To a certain youthful Heir-Apparent, in\r\nthe possession of whom alone his Royal Highness can be truly,\r\npermanently, and supremely happy. Most humbly dedicated to his Royal\r\nHighness, George, Prince of Wales, and earnestly recommended to the\r\nattention of the Members of both Houses of Parliament.\" When George\r\nthe Third was attacked for the first time with mental aberration,\r\nGraham hastened down to Windsor, and obtaining an interview there with\r\nthe Prince Regent, with thrilling earnestness of manner assured his\r\nRoyal Highness that he would suffer in the same way as his father\r\nunless he married a particular princess that he (Dr. Graham) was ready\r\nto introduce to him. On the Prince inquiring the name of the lady,\r\nGraham answered, \"Evangelical Wisdom.\" Possibly the royal patient\r\nwould have profited, had he obeyed the zealot's exhortation. The work,\r\nof which we have just given the title, is a frantic rhapsody on the\r\nbeauties and excellence of the Virgin Princess Wisdom, arranged in\r\nchapters and verses, and begins thus:--\r\n\r\n\"CHAP. 1.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hear! all ye people of the earth, and understand; give ear\r\nattentively, O ye kings and princes, and be admonished; yea, learn\r\nattentively, ye who are the rulers and the judges of the people.\"\r\n\r\n\"2. Let the inhabitants of the earth come before me with all the\r\ninnocency and docility of little children; and the kings and\r\ngovernors, with all purity and simplicity of heart.\r\n\r\n\"3. For the Holy Spirit of Wisdom! or celestial discipline! flees from\r\nduplicity and deceit, and from haughtiness and hardness of heart; it\r\nremoves far from the thoughts that are without understanding; and will\r\nnot abide when unrighteousness cometh in.\"\r\n\r\nThe man who was fool enough to write such stuff as this had, however,\r\nsome common sense. He detected the real cause of the maladies of half\r\nthose who consulted him, and he did his utmost to remove it. Like the\r\nFrench quack Villars, he preached up \"abstinence\" and \"cleanliness.\"\r\nOf the printed \"general instructions\" to his patients, No. 2 runs\r\nthus:--\"It will be unreasonable for Dr Graham's patients to expect a\r\ncomplete and lasting cure, or even great alleviation of their peculiar\r\nmaladies, unless they keep their body and limbs most perfectly clean\r\nwith frequent washings, breathe fresh open air day and night, be\r\nsimple in the quality and moderate in the quantity of their food and\r\ndrink, and totally give up using deadly poisons and weakeners of both\r\nbody and soul, and the canker-worms of estates, called foreign tea and\r\ncoffee, red port wine, spirituous liquors, tobacco and snuff, gaming\r\nand late hours, and all sinful and unnatural and excessive indulgence\r\nof the animal appetites, and of the diabolical and degrading mental\r\npassions. On practising the above rules, and a widely-open window day\r\nand night, and on washing with cold water, and going to bed every\r\nnight by eight or nine, and rising by four or five, depends the very\r\nperfection of bodily and mental health, strength, and happiness.\"\r\n\r\nMany to whom this advice was given thought that ill-health, which made\r\nthem unable to enjoy anything was no worse an evil than health brought\r\non terms that left them nothing to enjoy. During his career Graham\r\nmoved his \"Temple of Health\" from the Adelphi to Pall-Mall. But he did\r\nnot prosper in the long-run. His religious extravagances for a while\r\nbrought him adherents, but when they took the form of attacking the\r\nEstablished Church, they brought on him an army of adversaries. He\r\ncame also into humiliating collision with the Edinburgh authorities.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the curative means employed by Graham were as justifiable and\r\nbeneficial as the remedies of the celebrated doctors of Whitworth in\r\nYorkshire, the brothers Taylor. These gentlemen were farriers, by\r\nprofession, but condescended to prescribe for their own race as well,\r\nalways, however, regarding the vocation of brute-doctor as superior in\r\ndignity to that of a physician. Their system of practice was a\r\nvigorous one. They made no gradual and insidious advances on disease,\r\nbut opened against it a bombardment of shot and shell from all\r\ndirections. They bled their patients by the gallon, and drugged them\r\nby the stone. Their druggists, Ewbank and Wallis of York, used to\r\nsupply them with a ton of Glauber's salts at a time. In their\r\ndispensary scales and weights were regarded as the bugbears of ignoble\r\nminds. Every Sunday morning they bled _gratis_ any one who liked to\r\ndemand a prick from their lancets. Often a hundred poor people were\r\nseated on the surgery benches at the same time, waiting for\r\nvenesection. When each of the party had found a seat the two brothers\r\npassed rapidly along the lines of bared arms, the one doctor deftly\r\napplying the ligature above the elbow, and the other immediately\r\nopening the vein, the crimson stream from which was directed to a\r\nwooden trough that ran round the apartment in which the operations\r\nwere performed. The same magnificence of proportion characterized\r\ntheir administration of kitchen physic. If they ordered a patient\r\nbroth, they directed his nurse to buy a large leg of mutton, and boil\r\nit in a copper of water down to a strong decoction, of which a quart\r\nshould be administered at stated intervals.\r\n\r\nWhen the little Abbé de Voisenon was ordered by his physician to drink\r\na quart of ptisan per hour he was horrified. On his next visit the\r\ndoctor asked,\r\n\r\n\"What effect has the ptisan produced?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not any,\" answered the little Abbé.\r\n\r\n\"Have you taken it all?\"\r\n\r\n\"I could not take more than half of it.\"\r\n\r\nThe physician was annoyed, even angry that his directions had not been\r\ncarried out, and frankly said so.\r\n\r\n\"_Ah, my friend_,\" pleaded the Abbé, \"_how could you desire me to\r\nswallow a quart an hour?--I hold but a pint!_\"\r\n\r\nThis reminds us of a story we have heard told of an irascible\r\nphysician who died, after attaining a venerable age, at the close of\r\nthe last century. The story is one of those which, told once, are told\r\nmany times, and affixed to new personages, according to the whim or\r\nignorance of the narrator.\r\n\r\n\"Your husband is very ill--very ill--high fever,\" observed the Doctor\r\nto the poor labourer's wife; \"and he's old, worn, emaciated: his hand\r\nis as dry as a Suffolk cheese. You must keep giving him water--as much\r\nas he'll drink; and, as I am coming back to-night from Woodbridge,\r\nI'll see him again. There--don't come snivelling about me!--my heart\r\nis a deuced deal too hard to stand that sort of thing. But, since you\r\nwant something to cry about, just listen--your husband _isn't going to\r\ndie yet_! There, now you're disappointed. Well, you brought it on\r\nyourself. Mind lots of water--as much as he'll drink\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor was ashamed of the feminine tenderness of his heart, and\r\ntried to hide it under an affectation of cynicism, and a manner at\r\ntimes verging on brutality. Heaven bless all his descendants,\r\nscattered over the whole world, but all of them brave and virtuous! A\r\nvolume might be written on his good qualities; his only bad one being\r\nextreme irascibility. His furies were many, and sprung from divers\r\nvisitations; but nothing was so sure to lash him into a tempest as to\r\nbe pestered with idle questions.\r\n\r\n\"Water, sir?\" whined Molly Meagrim. \"To be sure, your honour--water he\r\nshall have, poor dear soul! But, your honour, how much water ought I\r\nto give him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Zounds, woman! haven't I told you to give him as much as he'll\r\ntake?--and you ask me how much! _How much?_--give him a couple of\r\npails of water, if he'll take 'em. Now, do you hear me, you old fool?\r\nGive him a couple of pails.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Lord bless your honour--yes,\" whined Molly.\r\n\r\nTo get beyond the reach of her miserable voice the Doctor ran to his\r\nhorse, and rode off to Woodbridge. At night as he returned, he stopped\r\nat the cottage to inquire after the sick man.\r\n\r\n\"He's bin took away, yer honour,\" said the woman, as the physician\r\nentered. \"The water didn't fare to do him noan good--noan in the\r\nlessest, sir. Only then we couldn't get down the right quantity,\r\nthough we did our best. We got down better nor a pail and a half,\r\nwhen he slipped out o' our hands. Ah, yer honour! if we could but ha'\r\ngot him to swaller the rest, he might still be alive! But we did our\r\nbest, Doctor!\"\r\n\r\nClumsy empirics, however, as the Taylors were, they attended people of\r\nthe first importance. The elder Taylor was called to London to attend\r\nThurlow, Bishop of Durham, the brother of Lord Chancellor Thurlow. The\r\nrepresentative men of the Faculty received him at the bishop's\r\nresidence, but he would not commence the consultation till the arrival\r\nof John Hunter. \"I won't say a word till Jack Hunter comes,\" roared\r\nthe Whitworth doctor; \"he's the only man of you who knows anything.\"\r\nWhen Hunter arrived, Taylor proceeded to his examination of the\r\nbishop's state, and, in the course of it, used some ointment which he\r\ntook from a box.\r\n\r\n\"What's it made of?\" Hunter asked.\r\n\r\n\"That's not a fair question,\" said Taylor, turning to the Lord\r\nChancellor, who happened to be present. \"No, no, Jack. I'll send you\r\nas much as you please, but I won't tell you what it's made of.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nST. JOHN LONG.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the entire history of charlatanism, however, it would be difficult\r\nto point to a career more extraordinary than the brilliant though\r\nbrief one of St. John Long, in our own cultivated London, at a time\r\nscarcely more than a generation distant from the present. Though a\r\npretender, and consummate quack, he was distinguished from the vulgar\r\nherd of cheats by the possession of enviable personal endowments, a\r\ngood address, and a considerable quantity of intellect. The son of an\r\nIrish basket-maker, he was born in or near Doneraile, and in his\r\nboyhood assisted in his father's humble business. His artistic\r\ntalents, which he cultivated for some time without the aid of a\r\ndrawing-master, enabled him, while still quite a lad, to discontinue\r\nworking as a rush-weaver. For a little while he stayed at Dublin, and\r\nhad some intercourse with Daniel Richardson the painter; after which\r\nhe moved to Limerick county, and started on his own account as a\r\nportrait-painter, and an instructor in the use of the brush. That his\r\neducation was not superior to what might be expected in a clever\r\nyouth of such lowly extraction, the following advertisement, copied\r\nfrom a Limerick paper of February 10, 1821, attests:--\r\n\r\n\"Mr John Saint John Long, Historical and Portrait Painter, the only\r\npupil of Daniel Richardson, Esq., late of Dublin, proposes, during his\r\nstay in Limerick, to take portraits from Ittalian Head to whole\r\nlength; and parson desirous of getting theirs done, in historical,\r\nhunting, shooting, fishing, or any other character; or their family,\r\ngrouped in one or two paintings from life-size to miniature, so as to\r\nmake an historical subject, choseing one from history.\"\r\n\r\n\"The costume of the period from whence it would be taken will be\r\nparticularly attended to, and the character of each proserved.\"\r\n\r\n\"He would take views in the country, terms per agreement. Specimens to\r\nbe seen at his Residence, No. 116, Georges Street, opposite the\r\nClub-house, and at Mr James Dodds, Paper-staining Warehouse, Georges\r\nStreet.\r\n\r\n\"Mr Long is advised by his several friends to give instructions in the\r\nArt of Painting in Oils, Opeak, Chalk, and Water-colours, &c., to a\r\nlimited number of Pupils of Respectability two days in each week at\r\nstated hours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen are not to attend at the same hour the Ladies attend at. He\r\nwill supply them in water-colours, &c.\"\r\n\r\nHow the young artist acquired the name of St. John is a mystery. When\r\nhe blazed into notoriety, his admirers asserted that it came to him in\r\ncompany with noble blood that ran in his veins; but more unkind\r\nobservers declared that it was assumed, as being likely to tickle the\r\nears of his credulous adherents. His success as a provincial\r\nart-professor was considerable. The gentry of Limerick liked his manly\r\nbearing and lively conversation, and invited him to their houses to\r\ntake likenesses of their wives, flirt with their daughters, and\r\naccompany their sons on hunting and shooting excursions. Emboldened by\r\ngood luck in his own country, and possibly finding the patronage of\r\nthe impoverished aristocracy of an Irish province did not yield him a\r\nsufficient income, he determined to try his fortune in England. Acting\r\non this resolve, he hastened to London, and with ingratiating manners\r\nand that persuasive tongue which nine Irishmen out of ten possess, he\r\nmanaged to get introductions to a few respectable drawing-rooms. He\r\neven obtained some employment from Sir Thomas Lawrence, as\r\ncolour-grinder and useful assistant in the studio; and was elected a\r\nmember of the Royal Society of Literature, and also of the Royal\r\nAsiatic Society. But like many an Irish adventurer, before and after\r\nhim, he found it hard work to live on his impudence, pleasant manners,\r\nand slender professional acquirements. He was glad to colour\r\nanatomical drawings for the professors and pupils of one of the minor\r\nsurgical schools of London; and in doing so picked up a few pounds and\r\na very slight knowledge of the structure of the human frame. The\r\ninformation so obtained stimulated him to further researches, and, ere\r\na few more months of starvation had passed over, he deemed himself\r\nqualified to cure all the bodily ailments to which the children of\r\nAdam are subject.\r\n\r\nHe invented a lotion or liniment endowed with the remarkable faculty\r\nof distinguishing between sound and unsound tissues. To a healthy part\r\nit was as innocuous as water; but when applied to a surface under\r\nwhich any seeds of disease were lurking, it became a violent irritant,\r\ncreating a sore over the seat of mischief, and stimulating nature to\r\nthrow off the morbid virus. He also instructed his patients to inhale\r\nthe vapour which rose from a certain mixture compounded by him in\r\nlarge quantities, and placed in the interior of a large mahogany case,\r\nwhich very much resembled an upright piano. In the sides of this piece\r\nof furniture were apertures, into which pipe-stalks were screwed for\r\nthe benefit of afflicted mortals, who, sitting on easy lounges, smoked\r\naway like a party of Turkish elders.\r\n\r\nWith these two agents St. John Long engaged to combat every form of\r\ndisease--gout, palsy, obstructions of the liver, cutaneous affections;\r\nbut the malady which he professed to have the most complete command\r\nover was consumption. His success in surrounding himself with patients\r\nwas equal to his audacity. He took a large house in Harley Street, and\r\nfitted it up for the reception of people anxious to consult him; and\r\nfor some seasons every morning and afternoon (from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.)\r\nthe public way was blocked up with carriages pressing to his door. The\r\nold and the young alike flocked to him; but nine of his patients out\r\nof every ten were ladies. For awhile the foolish of every rank in\r\nLondon seemed to have but one form in which to display their folly.\r\nNeedy matrons from obscure suburban villages came with their guineas\r\nto consult the new oracle; and ladies of the highest rank, fashion,\r\nand wealth, hastened to place themselves and their daughters at the\r\nmercy of a pretender's ignorance.\r\n\r\nUnparalleled were the scenes which the reception-rooms of that\r\nnotorious house in Harley Street witnessed. In one room were two\r\nenormous inhalers, with flexible tubes running outwards in all\r\ndirections, and surrounded by dozens of excited women--ladies of\r\nadvanced years, and young girls giddy with the excitement of their\r\nfirst London season--puffing from their lips the medicated vapour, or\r\nwaiting till a mouth-piece should be at liberty for their pink lips.\r\nIn another room the great magician received his patients. Some he\r\nordered to persevere in inhalation, others he divested of their\r\nraiment, and rubbed his miraculous liniment into their backs, between\r\ntheir shoulders or over their bosoms. Strange to say, these lavations\r\nand frictions--which invariably took place in the presence of third\r\npersons, nurses or invalids--had very different results. The fluid,\r\nwhich, as far as the eye could discern, was taken out of the same\r\nvessel, and was the same for all, would instantaneously produce on one\r\nlady a burning excoriation, which had in due course to be dressed with\r\ncabbage-leaves; but on another would be so powerless that she could\r\nwash in it, or drink it copiously, like ordinary pump-water, with\r\nimpunity. \"Yes,\" said the wizard, \"that was his system, and such were\r\nits effects. If a girl had tubercles in her lungs, the lotion applied\r\nto the outward surface of her chest would produce a sore, and extract\r\nthe virus from the organs of respiration. If a gentleman had a gouty\r\nfoot, and washed it in this new water of Jordan, at the cost of a\r\nlittle temporary irritation the vicious particles would leave the\r\naffected part. But on any sound person who bathed in it the fluid\r\nwould have no power whatever.\"\r\n\r\nThe news of the wonderful remedy flew to every part of the kingdom;\r\nand from every quarter sick persons, wearied of a vain search after an\r\nalleviation of their sufferings, flocked to London with hope renewed\r\nonce more. St. John Long had so many applicants for attention that he\r\nwas literally unable to give heed to all of them; and he availed\r\nhimself of this excess of business to select for treatment those cases\r\nonly where there seemed every chance of a satisfactory result. In this\r\nhe was perfectly candid, for time after time he declared that he would\r\ntake no one under his care who seemed to have already gone beyond\r\nhope. On one occasion he was called into the country to see a\r\ngentleman who was in the last stage of consumption; and after a brief\r\nexamination of the poor fellow's condition, he said frankly--\r\n\r\n\"Sir, you are so ill that I cannot take you under my charge at\r\npresent. You want stamina. Take hearty meals of beefsteaks and strong\r\nbeer; and if you are better in ten days, I'll do my best for you and\r\ncure you.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a safe offer to make, for the sick man lived little more than\r\nforty-eight hours longer.\r\n\r\nBut, notwithstanding the calls of his enormous practice, St. John Long\r\nfound time to enjoy himself. He went a great deal into fashionable\r\nsociety, and was petted by the great and high-born, not only because\r\nhe was a notoriety, but because of his easy manners, imposing\r\ncarriage, musical though hesitating voice, and agreeable disposition.\r\nHe was tall and slight, but strongly built; and his countenance, thin\r\nand firmly set, although frank in expression, caused beholders to\r\nthink highly of his intellectual refinement, as well as of his\r\ndecision and energy. Possibly his personal advantages had no slight\r\ninfluence with his feminine applauders. But he possessed other\r\nqualities yet more fitted to secure their esteem--an Irish impetuosity\r\nof temperament and a sincere sympathy with the unfortunate. He was an\r\nexcellent horseman, hunting regularly, and riding superb horses. On\r\none occasion, as he was cantering round the Park, he saw a man strike\r\na woman, and without an instant's consideration he pulled up, leaped\r\nto the ground, seized the fellow bodily, and with one enormous effort\r\nflung him slap over the Park rails.\r\n\r\nBut horse-exercise was the only masculine pastime he was very fond of.\r\nHe was very temperate in his habits; and although Irish gentlemen\r\n_used_ to get tipsy, he never did. Painting, music, and the society of\r\na few really superior women, were the principal sources of enjoyment\r\nto which this brilliant charlatan had recourse in his leisure hours.\r\nMany were the ladies of rank and girls of gentle houses who would have\r\ngladly linked their fortunes to him and his ten thousand a year.[20]\r\nBut though numerous matrimonial overtures were made to him, he\r\npersevered in his bachelor style of life; and although he was received\r\nwith peculiar intimacy into the privacy of female society, scandal\r\nnever even charged him with a want of honour or delicacy towards\r\nwomen, apart from his quackery. Indeed, he broke off his professional\r\nconnection with one notorious lady of rank, rather than gratify her\r\neccentric wish to have her likeness taken by him in that remarkable\r\ncostume--or no costume at all--in which she was wont to receive her\r\nvisitors.\r\n\r\n  [20] A writer in the _Gentleman's Magazine_ for 1843 observes:--\"In\r\n  England, after Sir Astley, whose superiority of mind or dexterity of\r\n  hand stood uncontested, another practitioner in that category of the\r\n  Faculty of which it has been said, 'Periculis nostris, et experimenta\r\n  per mortes agunt medici,' the once famous St John Long was, I believe,\r\n  the most largely requited. I had some previous knowledge of him, and\r\n  in 1830 he showed me his pass-book with his bankers, Sir Claude Scott\r\n  and Co., displaying a series of credits from July, 1829, to July,\r\n  1830, or a single year's operations, to the extent of £13,400, But the\r\n  delusion soon vanished. One act of liberality on his part at that\r\n  period, however, I think it fair to record. To a gentleman who had\r\n  rendered him some literary aid, which his defective education made\r\n  indispensable, he presented double, not only what he was assured would\r\n  be an ample remuneration, but what exceeded fourfold the sum his\r\n  friend would have been satisfied with, or had expected.\"\r\n\r\nIn the exercise of his art he treated women unscrupulously. Amidst the\r\ncrowd of ladies who thronged his reception-rooms he moved, smiling,\r\ncourteous, and watchful, listening to their mutual confidences about\r\ntheir maladies, the constitutions of their relations, and their family\r\ninterests. Every stray sentence the wily man caught up and retained in\r\nhis memory, for future use. To induce those to become his patients who\r\nhad nothing the matter with them, and consequently would go to swell\r\nthe list of his successful cases, he used the most atrocious\r\nartifices.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Lady Emily, I saw your dear sister,\" he would say to a patient,\r\n\"yesterday--driving in the Park--lovely creature she is! Ah, poor\r\nthing!\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor thing, Mr. Long!--why, Catherine is the picture of health!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" the adroit fellow would answer, sadly, \"you think so--so does\r\nshe--and so does every one besides myself who sees her;\r\nbut--but--unless prompt remedial measures are taken that dear girl,\r\nere two short years have flown, will be in her grave.\" This mournful\r\nprophecy would be speedily conveyed to Catherine's ears; and, under\r\nthe influence of that nervous dread of death which almost invariably\r\ntorments the youthful and healthy, she would implore the great\r\nphysician to save her from her doom. It was not difficult to quiet her\r\nanxious heart. Attendance at 41, Harley Street, for six weeks, during\r\nwhich time a sore was created on her breast by the corrosive liniment,\r\nand cured by the application of cabbage-leaves and nature's kindly\r\nprocesses, enabled her to go out once more into the world, sounding\r\nher saviour's praises, and convinced that she might all her life long\r\nexpose herself to the most trying changes of atmosphere, without\r\nincurring any risk of chest-affection.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Long had not calculated that, although nine hundred and\r\nninety-nine constitutions out of every thousand would not be\r\nmaterially injured by his treatment, he would at rare intervals meet\r\nwith a patient of delicate organization, on whom the application of\r\nhis blistering fluid would be followed by the most serious\r\nconsequences. In the summer of the year 1830, two young ladies, of a\r\ngood Irish family, named Cashin, came to London, and were inveigled\r\ninto the wizard's net. They were sisters; and the younger of them,\r\nbeing in delicate health, called on Mr. Long, accompanied by her\r\nelder sister. The ordinary course of inhalation and rubbing was\r\nprescribed for the invalid; and ere long, frightened by the quack's\r\nprediction that, unless she was subjected to immediate treatment, she\r\nwould fall into a rapid consumption, the other young lady submitted to\r\nhave the corrosive lotion rubbed over her back and shoulders. The\r\noperation was performed on the 3rd of August. Forthwith a violent\r\ninflammation was established: the wound, instead of healing, became\r\ndaily and hourly of a darker and more unhealthy aspect; unable to bear\r\nthe cabbage-leaves on the raw and suppurating surface, the sufferer\r\ninduced her nurse to apply a comforting poultice to the part, but no\r\nrelief was obtained from it. St. John Long was sent for, and the 14th\r\n(just eleven days after the exhibition of the corrosive liniment), he\r\nfound his victim in a condition of extreme exhaustion and pain, and\r\nsuffering from continued sickness. Taking these symptoms as a mere\r\nmatter of course, he ordered her a tumbler of mulled wine, and took\r\nhis departure. On the following day (Sunday, 15th) he called again,\r\nand offered to dress the wound. But the poor girl, suddenly waking up\r\nto the peril of her position, would not permit him to touch her, and,\r\nraising herself with an effort in her bed, exclaimed--\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, Mr. Long, you shall not touch my back again--you very well\r\nknow that when I became your patient I was in perfect health, but now\r\nyou are killing me!\" Without losing his self-command at this pathetic\r\nappeal, he looked into her earnest eyes, and said, impressively--\r\n\r\n\"Whatever inconvenience you are now suffering, it will be of short\r\nduration, for in two or three days you will be in better health than\r\nyou ever were in your life.\"\r\n\r\nBut his words did not restore her confidence. The next day (the 16th)\r\nMr., now Sir Benjamin, Brodie was sent for, and found on the wretched\r\ngirl's back an inflamed surface about the size of a plate, having in\r\nthe centre a spot as large as the palm of his hand, which was in a\r\nstate of mortification. The time for rescue was past. Sir Benjamin\r\nprescribed a saline draught to allay the sickness; and within\r\ntwenty-four hours Catherine Cashin, who a fortnight before had been in\r\nperfect health and high spirits--an unusually lovely girl, in her 25th\r\nyear--lay upon her bed in the quiet of death.\r\n\r\nAn uproar immediately ensued; and there was an almost universal cry\r\nfrom the intelligent people of the country, that the empiric should be\r\npunished. A coroner's inquest was held; and, in spite of the efforts\r\nmade by the charlatan's fashionable adherents, a verdict was obtained\r\nfrom the jury of man-slaughter against St. John Long. Every attempt\r\nwas made by a set of influential persons of high rank to prevent the\r\nlaw from taking its ordinary course. The issue of the warrant for the\r\napprehension of the offender was most mysteriously and scandalously\r\ndelayed: and had it not been for the energy of Mr. Wakley, who, in a\r\nlong and useful career of public service, has earned for himself much\r\nundeserved obloquy, the affair would, even after the verdict of the\r\ncoroner's jury, have been hushed up. Eventually, however, on Saturday,\r\nOctober 30, St. John Long was placed in the dock of old Bailey,\r\ncharged with the manslaughter of Miss Cashin. Instead of deserting him\r\nin his hour of need, his admirers--male and female--presented\r\nthemselves at the Central Criminal Court, to encourage him by their\r\nsympathy, and to give evidence in his favour. The carriages of\r\ndistinguished members of the nobility brought fair freights of the\r\nfirst fashion of May-fair down to the gloomy court-house that adjoins\r\nNewgate; and belles of the first fashion sat all through the day in\r\nthe stifling atmosphere of a crowded court, looking languishingly at\r\ntheir hero in the dock, who, from behind his barrier of rue and\r\nfennel, distributed to them smiles of grateful recognition. The Judge\r\n(Mr. Justice Park) manifested throughout the trial a strong\r\npartisanship with the prisoner; and the Marchioness of Ormond, who was\r\naccommodated with a seat on the bench by his Lordship's side,\r\nconversed with him in whispers during the proceedings. The summing up\r\nwas strongly in favour of the accused; but, in spite of the partial\r\njudge, and an array of fashionable witnesses in favour of the\r\nprisoner, the jury returned a verdict of guilty.\r\n\r\nAs it was late on Saturday when the verdict was given, the judge\r\ndeferred passing sentence till the following Monday. At the opening of\r\nthe court on that day a yet greater crush of the _beau monde_ was\r\npresent; and the judge, instead of awarding a term of imprisonment to\r\nthe guilty man, condemned him merely to pay a fine of £250, or to be\r\nimprisoned till such fine was paid. Mr. St. John Long immediately took\r\na roll of notes from his pocket, paid the mulct, and leaving the court\r\nwith his triumphant friends, accepted a seat in Lord Sligo's\r\ncurricle, and drove to the west end of the town.\r\n\r\nThe scandalous sentence was a fit conclusion to the absurd scenes\r\nwhich took place in the court of the Old Bailey, and at the coroner's\r\ninquest. At one or the other of these inquiries the witnesses advanced\r\nthousands of outrageous statements, of which the following may be\r\ntaken as a fair specimen:--\r\n\r\nOne young lady gave evidence that she had been cured of consumption by\r\nMr. Long's liniment; she knew she had been so cured, because she had a\r\nvery bad cough, and, after the rubbing in all the ointment, the cough\r\nwent away. An old gentleman testified that he had for years suffered\r\nfrom attacks of the gout, at intervals of from one to three months; he\r\nwas convinced Mr. Long had cured him, because he had been free from\r\ngout for five weeks. Another gentleman had been tortured with\r\nheadache; Mr. Long applied his lotion to it--the humour which caused\r\nhis headache came away in a clear limpid discharge. A third gentleman\r\naffirmed that Mr. Long's liniment had reduced a dislocation of his\r\nchild's hip-joint. The Marchioness of Ormond, on oath, stated that she\r\n_knew_ that Miss Cashin's back was rubbed with the same fluid as she\r\nand her daughters had used to wash their hands with; but she admitted\r\nthat she neither _saw_ the back rubbed, nor _saw_ the fluid with which\r\nit was rubbed taken from the bottle. Sir Francis Burdett also bore\r\ntestimony to the harmlessness of Mr. Long's system of practice. Mr.\r\nWakley, in the _Lancet_, asserted that Sir Francis Burdett had called\r\non Long to ask him if his liniment would give the Marquis of Anglesea\r\na leg, in the place of the one he lost at Waterloo, if it were\r\napplied to the stump. Long gave an encouraging answer; and the lotion\r\nwas applied, with the result of producing not an entire foot and\r\nleg--but a great toe!\r\n\r\nMiss Cashin's death was quickly followed by another fatal case. A Mrs.\r\nLloyd died from the effects of the corrosive lotion; and again a\r\ncoroner's jury found St. John Long guilty of manslaughter, and again\r\nhe was tried at the Old Bailey--but this second trial terminated in\r\nhis acquital.\r\n\r\nIt seems scarcely creditable, and yet it is true, that these exposures\r\ndid not have the effect of lessening his popularity. The respectable\r\norgans of the Press--the _Times_, the _Chronicle_, the _Herald_, the\r\n_John Bull_, the _Lancet_, the _Examiner_, the _Spectator_, the\r\n_Standard_, the _Globe_, _Blackwood_, and _Fraser_, combined in doing\r\ntheir best to render him contemptible in the eyes of his supporters.\r\nBut all their efforts were in vain. His old dupes remained staunch\r\nadherents to him, and every day brought fresh converts to their body.\r\nWith unabashed front he went everywhere, proclaiming himself a martyr\r\nin the cause of humanity, and comparing his evil treatment to the\r\npersecutions that Galileo, Harvey, Jenner, and Hunter underwent at the\r\nhands of the prejudiced and ignorant. Instead of uncomplainingly\r\ntaking the lashes of satirical writers, he first endeavored to bully\r\nthem into silence, and swaggering into newspaper and magazine offices\r\nasked astonished editors how they _dared_ to call him a _quack_.\r\nFinding, however, that this line of procedure would not improve his\r\nposition, he wrote his defence, and published it in an octavo volume,\r\ntogether with numerous testimonials of his worth from grateful\r\npatients, and also a letter of cordial support from Dr. Ramadge, M.D.,\r\nOxon., a fellow of the College of Physicians. In a ridiculous and\r\nungrammatical epistle, defending this pernicious quack, who had been\r\nconvicted of manslaughter, Dr. Ramadge displayed not less anxiety to\r\nblacken the reputation of his own profession, than he did to clear the\r\nfame of the charlatan whom he designated \"_a guiltless and a cruelly\r\npersecuted individual!!!_\" The book itself is one of the most\r\ninteresting to be found in quack literature. On the title-page is a\r\nmotto from Pope--\"No man deserves a monument who could not be wrapped\r\nin a winding-sheet of papers written against him\"; and amongst pages\r\nof jargon about humoral pathology, it contains confident predictions\r\nthat if his victims had _continued_ in his system, they would have\r\nlived. The author accuses the most eminent surgeons and physicians of\r\nhis time of gross ignorance, and of having conspired together to crush\r\nhim, because they were jealous of his success and envious of his\r\nincome. He even suggests that the same saline draught, prescribed by\r\nSir Benjamin Brodie, killed Miss Cashin. Amongst those whose\r\ntestimonials appear in the body of the work are the _then_ Lord\r\nIngestre (his enthusiastic supporter), Dr. Macartney, the Marchioness\r\nof Ormond, Lady Harriet Kavanagh, the Countess of Buckinghamshire, and\r\nthe Marquis of Sligo. The Marchioness of Ormond testifies how Mr. Long\r\nhad miraculously cured her and her daughter of \"headaches,\" and her\r\nyoungest children of \"smart attacks of feverish colds, one with\r\ninflammatory sore throat, the others with more serious bad symptoms.\"\r\nThe Countess of Buckinghamshire says she is cured of \"headache and\r\nlassitude\"; and Lord Ingestre avows his belief that Mr. Long's system\r\nis \"preventive of disease,\" because he himself is much less liable to\r\ncatch cold than he was before trying it.\r\n\r\nNumerous pamphlets also were written in defence of John St. John Long,\r\nEsq., M.R.S.L., and M.R.A.S. An anonymous author (calling himself a\r\ngraduate of Trinity College, Cambridge, and Member of the Middle\r\nTemple), in a tract dated 1831, does not hesitate to compare the\r\nobject of his eulogy with the author of Christianity. \"But who can\r\nwonder at Mr Long's persecutions? The brightest character that ever\r\nstept was persecuted, even unto death! His cures were all perverted,\r\nbut they were not the less complete; they were miraculous, but they\r\nwere not the less certain!\"\r\n\r\nTo the last St. John Long retained his practice; but death removed him\r\nfrom the scene of his triumphs while he was still a young man. The\r\nvery malady, his control over which he had so loudly proclaimed,\r\nbrought his career--in which knavery or self-delusion, doubtless both,\r\nplayed a part--to an end. He died of consumption, at the age of\r\nthirty-seven years. Even in the grave his patients honoured him, for\r\nthey erected an elegant and costly monument to his memory, and adorned\r\nit with the following inscription.\r\n\r\n          \"It is the fate of most men\r\n      To have many enemies, and few friends.\r\n              This monumental pile\r\n        Is not intended to mark the career,\r\n                   But to shew\r\n       How much its inhabitant was respected\r\n            By those who knew his worth,\r\n                And the benefits\r\n       Derived from his remedial discovery.\r\n                  He is now at rest,\r\n        And far beyond the praises or censures\r\n                  Of this world.\r\n    Stranger, as you respect the receptacle of the dead\r\n        (As one of the many who will rest here),\r\n                 Read the name of\r\n               John Saint John Long\r\n                 without comment.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the exquisite drollery of this inscription, in\r\nspeaking of a plebeian quack-doctor (who, by the exercise of\r\nempiricism, raised himself to the possession of £5000 per annum, and\r\nthe intimate friendship of numbers of the aristocracy) as the victim\r\nof \"many enemies and few friends,\" it cannot be said to be open to\r\nmuch censure. Indeed, St. John Long's worshippers were for the most\r\npart of that social grade in which bad taste is rare, though weakness\r\nof understanding possibly may not be uncommon.\r\n\r\nThe sepulchre itself is a graceful structure, and occupies a prominent\r\nposition in the Kensal Green cemetery, by the side of the principal\r\ncarriage-way, leading from the entrance-gate to the chapel of the\r\nburial-ground. Immediately opposite to it, on the other side of the\r\ngravel drive, stands, not inappropriately, the flaunting sepulchre of\r\nAndrew Ducrow, the horse-rider, \"whose death,\" the inscription informs\r\nus, \"deprived the arts and sciences of an eminent professor and\r\nliberal patron.\" When any cockney bard shall feel himself inspired to\r\nwrite an elegy on the west-end grave-yard, he will not omit to compare\r\nJohn St. John Long's tomb with that of \"the liberal patron of the arts\r\nand sciences,\" and also with the cumbrous heap of masonry which\r\ncovers the ashes of Dr. Morrison, hygeist, which learned word, being\r\ninterpreted, means \"the inventor of Morrison's pills.\"\r\n\r\nTo give a finishing touch to the memoir of this celebrated charlatan,\r\nit may be added that after his death his property became the subject\r\nof tedious litigation; and amongst the claimants upon it was a woman\r\nadvanced in years, and of an address and style that proved her to\r\nbelong to a very humble state of life. This woman turned out to be St.\r\nJohn Long's wife. He had married her when quite a lad, had found it\r\nimpossible to live with her, and consequently had induced her to\r\nconsent to an amicable separation. This discovery was a source of\r\ngreat surprise, and also of enlightenment to the numerous high-born\r\nand richly-endowed ladies who had made overtures of marriage to the\r\nidolized quack, and, much to their surprise, had had their advances\r\nadroitly but firmly declined.\r\n\r\nThere are yet to be found in English society, ladies--not silly,\r\nfrivolous women, but some of those on whom the world of intellect has\r\nput the stamp of its approval--who cherish such tender reminiscences\r\nof St. John Long, that they cannot mention his name without their eyes\r\nbecoming bright with tears. Of course this proves nothing, save the\r\ncredulity and fond infatuation of the fair ones who love. The hands of\r\nwomen decked Nero's tomb with flowers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _THE ANATOMIST_]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nTHE QUARRELS OF PHYSICIANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor many a day authors have had the reputation of being more sensitive\r\nand quarrelsome than any other set of men. Truth to tell, they are not\r\nalways so amiable and brilliant as their works. There is in them the\r\nnational churlishness inducing them to nurse a contempt for every one\r\nthey don't personally know, and a spirit of antagonism towards nearly\r\nevery one they do. But to say this is only to say that they are made\r\nof British oak. Unfortunately, however, they carry on their\r\ncontentions in a manner that gives them a wide publicity and a\r\ntroublesome duration of fame. Soldiers, when they quarrelled in the\r\nlast century, shot one another like gentlemen, at two paces' distance,\r\nand with the crack of their pistols the whole noise of the matter\r\nceased. Authors, from time immemorial, have in their angry moments\r\nrushed into print, and lashed their adversaries with satire, rendered\r\npermanent by aid of the printer's devil,--thus letting posterity know\r\nall the secrets of their folly, whilst the merciful grave put an end\r\nto all memorial of the extravagances of their friends. There was\r\nless love between Radcliffe and Hannes, Freind and Blackmore, Gibbons\r\nand Garth, than between Pope and Dennis, Swift and Grub Street. But we\r\nknow all about the squabbles of the writers from their poems; whereas\r\nonly a vague tradition, in the form of questionable anecdotes, has\r\ncome down to us of the animosities of the doctors--a tradition which\r\nwould long ere this have died out, had not Garth--author as well as\r\nphysician--written the \"Dispensary,\" and a host of dirty little\r\napothecaries contracted a habit of scribbling lampoons about their\r\nprofessional superiors.\r\n\r\nLuckily for the members of it, the Faculty of Medicine is singularly\r\nbarren of biographies. The career of a physician is so essentially one\r\nof confidence, that even were he to keep a memorial of its interesting\r\noccurrences, his son wouldn't dare to sell it to a publisher as the\r\n\"Revelations of a Departed Physician.\" Long ere it would be decent or\r\nsafe to print such a diary, the public would have ceased to take an\r\ninterest in the writer. Pettigrew's \"Life of Lettsom,\" and Macilwain's\r\n\"Memoirs of Abernethy,\" are almost the only two passable biographies\r\nof eminent medical practitioners in the English language; and the last\r\nof these does not presume to enter fully on the social relations of\r\nthe great surgeon. The lives of Hunter and Jenner are meagre and\r\nunworthily executed, and of Bransby Cooper's Life of his uncle little\r\ncan be said that is not in the language of emphatic condemnation.\r\n\r\nFrom this absence of biographical literature the medical profession at\r\nleast derives this advantage--the world at large knows comparatively\r\nlittle of their petty feuds and internal differences than it would\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\nThe few memorials, however, that we have of the quarrels of physicians\r\nare of a kind that makes us wish we had more. Of the great battle of\r\nthe apothecaries with the physicians we have already spoken in the\r\nnotice of Sir Samuel Garth. To those who are ignorant of human nature\r\nit may appear incredible that a body, so lovingly united against\r\ncommon foes, should have warred amongst themselves. Yet such was the\r\ncase. A London druggist once put up at the chief inn of a provincial\r\ncapital, whither he had come in the course of his annual summer ride.\r\nThe good man thought it would hurt neither his health nor his\r\ninterests to give \"a little supper\" to the apothecaries of the town\r\nwith whom he was in the habit of doing business. Under the influence\r\nof this feeling he sallied out from \"The White Horse,\" and spent a few\r\nhours in calling on his friends--asking for orders and delivering\r\ninvitations. On returning to his inn, he ordered a supper for\r\ntwelve--as eleven medical gentlemen had engaged to sup with him. When\r\nthe hour appointed for the repast was at hand, a knock at the door was\r\nfollowed by the appearance of guest A, with a smile of intense\r\nbenevolence and enjoyment. Another rap--and guest B entered. A looked\r\nblank--every trace of happiness suddenly vanishing from his face. B\r\nstared at A, as much as to say, \"You be ----!\" A shuffled with his\r\nfeet, rose, made an apology to his host for leaving the room to attend\r\nto a little matter, and disappeared. Another rap--and C made his bow\r\nof greeting. \"I'll try to be back in five minutes, but if I'm not,\r\ndon't wait for me,\" cried B, hurriedly seizing his hat and rushing\r\nfrom the apartment. C, a cold-blooded, phlegmatic man, sat down\r\nunconcernedly, and was a picture of sleeping contentment till the\r\nentry of D, when his hair stood on end, and he fled into the inn-yard,\r\nas if he were pursued by a hyena. E knocked and said, \"How d' you do?\"\r\nD sprung from his chair, and shouted, \"Good-bye!\" And so it went on\r\ntill, on guest No. 11 joining the party--that had received so many new\r\ncomers, and yet never for an instant numbered more than three--No. 10\r\njumped through the window, and ran down the street to the bosom of his\r\nfamily. The hospitable druggist and No. 11 found, on a table provided\r\nfor twelve, quite as much supper as they required.\r\n\r\nNext morning the druggist called on A for an explanation of his\r\nconduct. \"Sir,\" was the answer, \"I could not stop in the same room\r\nwith such a scoundrel as B.\" So it went straight down the line. B had\r\nvowed never to exchange words with C. C would be shot rather than sit\r\nat the same table with such a scoundrel as D.\r\n\r\n\"You gentlemen,\" observed the druggist, with a smile to each, \"seem to\r\nbe almost as well disposed amongst yourselves as your brethren in\r\nLondon; only they, when they meet, don't run from each other, but draw\r\nup, square their elbows, and fight like men.\"\r\n\r\nThe duel between Mead and Woodward, as it is more particularly\r\nmentioned in another part of these volumes, we need here only to\r\nallude to. The contest between Cheyne and Wynter was of a less bloody\r\ncharacter. Cheyne was a Bath physician, of great practice and yet\r\ngreater popularity--dying in 1743, at the age of seventy-two. At one\r\ntime of his life he was so prodigiously fat that he weighed 32 stone,\r\nhe and a gentleman named Tantley being the two stoutest men in\r\nSomersetshire. One day, after dinner, the former asked the latter what\r\nhe was thinking about.\r\n\r\n\"I was thinking,\" answered Tantley, \"how it will be possible to get\r\neither you or me into the grave after we die.\"\r\n\r\nCheyne was nettled, and retorted, \"Six or eight stout fellows will do\r\nthe business for me, but you must be taken at twice.\"\r\n\r\nCheyne was a sensible man, and had more than one rough passage of arms\r\nwith Beau Nash, when the beau was dictator of the pump-room. Nash\r\ncalled the doctor in and asked him to prescribe for him. The next day,\r\nwhen the physician called and inquired if his prescription had been\r\nfollowed, the beau languidly replied:--\r\n\r\n\"No, i' faith, doctor, I haven't followed it. 'Pon honour, if I had I\r\nshould have broken my neck, for I threw it out of my bed-room window.\"\r\n\r\nBut Cheyne had wit enough to reward the inventor of the white hat for\r\nthis piece of insolence. One day he and some of his learned friends\r\nwere enjoying themselves over the bottle, laughing with a heartiness\r\nunseemly in philosophers, when, seeing the beau draw near, the doctor\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n\"Hush, we must be grave now, here's a fool coming our way.\"\r\n\r\nCheyne became ashamed of his obesity, and earnestly set about\r\novercoming it. He brought himself down by degrees to a moderate diet,\r\nand took daily a large amount of exercise. The result was that he\r\nreduced himself to under eleven stone, and, instead of injuring his\r\nconstitution, found himself in the enjoyment of better health.\r\nImpressed with the value of the discovery he had made, he wrote a book\r\nurging all people afflicted with chronic maladies to imitate him and\r\ntry the effects of temperance. Doctors, notwithstanding their precepts\r\nin favour of moderation, neither are, nor ever have been, averse to\r\nthe pleasures of the table. Many of them warmly resented Cheyne's\r\nendeavours to bring good living into disrepute, possibly deeming that\r\ntheir interests were attacked not less than their habits. Dryden\r\nwrote,\r\n\r\n    \"The first physicians by debauch were made.\r\n    Excess began, and sloth sustained the trade;\r\n    By chase our long-liv'd fathers earned their food,\r\n    Toil strung their nerves and purified their blood;\r\n    But we, their sons, a pamper'd race of men,\r\n    Are dwindled down to threescore years and ten.\r\n    Better to hunt in fields for health unbought,\r\n    Than fee the doctor for a nauseous draught;\r\n    The wise for cure on exercise depend,\r\n    God never made his work for man to mend.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Wynter arose to dispose of Cheyne in a summary fashion. Wynter had\r\ntwo good reasons for hating Cheyne: Wynter was an Englishman and loved\r\nwine, Cheyne was a Scotchman and loved milk.\r\n\r\n          DR. WYNTER TO DR. CHEYNE.\r\n\r\n    \"Tell me from whom, fat-headed Scot,\r\n      Thou didst thy system learn;\r\n    From Hippocrate thou hadst it not,\r\n      Nor Celsus, nor Pitcairn.\r\n\r\n    \"Suppose we own that milk is good,\r\n      And say the same of grass;\r\n    The one for babes is only food,\r\n      The other for an ass.\r\n\r\n    \"Doctor, one new prescription try\r\n     (A friend's advice forgive),\r\n    Eat grass, reduce thyself, and die,\r\n     Thy patients then may live.\"\r\n\r\nCheyne responded, with more wit and more good manners, in the\r\nfollowing fashion:--\r\n\r\n       \"DR. CHEYNE TO DR. WYNTER.\r\n\r\n    \"My system, doctor, is my own,\r\n      No tutor I pretend;\r\n    My blunders hurt myself alone,\r\n      But yours your dearest friend.\r\n\r\n    \"Were you to milk and straw confin'd,\r\n      Thrice happy might you be;\r\n    Perhaps you might regain your mind,\r\n      And from your wit be free.\"\r\n\r\n    \"I can't your kind prescription try,\r\n      But heartily forgive;\r\n    'Tis natural you should wish me die,\r\n      That you yourself may live.\"\r\n\r\nThe concluding two lines of Cheyne's answer were doubtless little to\r\nthe taste of his unsuccessful opponent.\r\n\r\nIn their contentions physicians have not often had recourse to the\r\nduel. With them an appeal to arms has rarely been resorted to, but\r\nwhen it has been deliberately made the combatants have usually fought\r\nwith decision. The few duels fought between women have for the most\r\npart been characterized by American ferocity. Madame Dunoyer mentions\r\na case of a duel with swords between two ladies of rank, who would\r\nhave killed each other had they not been separated. In a feminine duel\r\non the Boulevard St. Antoine, mentioned by De la Colombèire, both the\r\nprincipals received several wounds on the face and bosom--a most\r\nimportant fact illustrative of the pride the fair sex take in those\r\nparts.[21] Sometimes ladies have distinguished themselves by fighting\r\nduels with men. Mademoiselle Dureux fought her lover Antinotti in an\r\nopen street. The actress Maupin challenged Dumény, but he declined to\r\ngive her satisfaction; so the lady stripped him of watch and\r\nsnuff-box, and bore them away as trophies of victory. The same lady,\r\non another occasion, having insulted in a ball-room a distinguished\r\npersonage of her own sex, was requested by several gentlemen to quit\r\nthe entertainment. She obeyed, but forthwith challenged and fought\r\neach of the meddlesome cavaliers--and killed them all! The slaughter\r\naccomplished, she returned to the ball-room, and danced in the\r\npresence of her rival. The Marquise de Nesle and the Countess\r\nPolignac, under the Regency, fought with pistols for the possession of\r\nthe Duc de Richelieu. In or about the year 1827, a lady of\r\nChâteauroux, whose husband had received a slap in the face, called out\r\nthe offender, and severely wounded him in a duel fought with swords.\r\nThe most dramatic affair of honour, however, in the annals of female\r\nduelling occurred in the year 1828, when a young French girl\r\nchallenged a _garde du corps_ who had seduced her. At the meeting the\r\nseconds took the precaution of loading without ball, the fair\r\nprincipal of course being kept in ignorance of the arrangement. She\r\nfired first and saw her seducer remain unhurt. Without flinching, or\r\nchanging colour, she stood watching her adversary, whilst he took a\r\ndeliberate aim (in order to test her courage), and then, after a\r\npainful pause, fired into the air.\r\n\r\n  [21] _Vide_ Millingen's \"History of Duelling.\"\r\n\r\nPhysicians have been coupled with priests, as beings holding a\r\nposition between the two sexes. In the Lancashire factories they\r\nallow women and clergymen the benefit of an entrée--because they don't\r\nunderstand business. Doctors and ladies could hardly be coupled\r\ntogether by the same consideration; but they might be put in one class\r\nout of respect to that gentleness of demeanour and suavity of voice\r\nwhich distinguish the members of the medical profession, in common\r\nwith well-bred women.\r\n\r\nGentle though they be, physicians have, however, sometimes indulged in\r\nwordy wrangling, and then had recourse to more sanguinary arguments.\r\n\r\nThe duel between Dr. Williams and Dr. Bennet was one of the bloodiest\r\nin the eighteenth century. They first battered each other with\r\npamphlets, and then exchanged blows. Matters having advanced so far,\r\nDr. Bennet proposed that the fight should be continued in a\r\ngentlemanly style--with powder instead of fists. The challenge was\r\ndeclined; whereupon Dr. Bennet called on Dr. Williams, to taunt him\r\nwith a charge of cowardice. No sooner had he rapped at the door, than\r\nit was opened by Williams himself, holding in his hand a pistol loaded\r\nwith swan-shot, which he, without a moment's parley, discharged into\r\nhis adversary's breast. Severely wounded, Bennet retired across the\r\nstreet to a friend's house, followed by Williams, who fired another\r\npistol at him. Such was the demoniacal fury of Williams, that, not\r\ncontented with this outrage, he drew his sword, and ran Bennet through\r\nthe body. But this last blow was repaid. Bennet managed to draw his\r\nrapier, and give his ferocious adversary a home-thrust--his sword\r\nentering the breast, coming out through the shoulder-blade, and\r\nsnapping short. Williams crawled back in the direction of his house,\r\nbut before he could reach it fell down dead. Bennet lived only four\r\nhours. A pleasant scene for the virtuous capital of a civilized and\r\nChristian people!\r\n\r\nThe example of Dr. Bennet and Dr. Williams was not lost upon the\r\nphysicians of our American cousins. In the August of 1830, a meeting\r\ntook place, near Philadelphia, between Dr. Smith and Dr. Jeffries.\r\nThey exchanged shots at eight paces, without inflicting any injury,\r\nwhen their friends interposed, and tried to arrange the difficulty;\r\nbut Dr. Jeffries swore that he would not leave the ground till some\r\none had been killed. The principals were therefore put up again. At\r\nthe second exchange of shots Dr. Smith's right arm was broken, when he\r\ngallantly declared that, as he was wounded, it would be gratifying to\r\nhis feelings, to be killed. Third exchange of shots, and Dr. Smith,\r\nfiring with his left arm, hits his man in the thigh, causing immense\r\nloss of blood. Five minutes were occupied in bandaging the wound; when\r\nDr. Jeffries, properly primed with brandy, requested that no further\r\nobstacles might be raised between him and satisfaction. For a fourth\r\ntime the mad men were put up--at the distance of six feet. The result\r\nwas fatal to both. Dr. Smith dropped dead with a ball in his heart.\r\nDr. Jeffries was shot through the breast, and survived only a few\r\nhours. The conduct of Dr. Jeffries during those last few hours was\r\nadmirable, and most delightfully in keeping with the rest of the\r\nproceeding. On seeing his antagonist prostrate, the doctor asked if he\r\nwas dead. On being assured that his enemy lived no longer, he\r\nobserved, \"Then I die contented.\" He then stated that he had been a\r\nschool-mate with Dr. Smith, and that, during the fifteen years\r\nthroughout which they had been on terms of great intimacy and\r\nfriendship, he had valued him highly as a man of science and a\r\ngentleman.\r\n\r\nOne of the latest duels in which an English physician was concerned as\r\na principal was that fought on the 10th of May, 1833, near Exeter,\r\nbetween Sir John Jeffcott and Dr. Hennis. Dr. Hennis received a wound,\r\nof which he died. The affair was brought into the Criminal Court, and\r\nwas for a short time a _cause célèbre_ on the western circuit; but the\r\nmemory of it has now almost entirely disappeared.\r\n\r\nAs we have already stated, duels have been rare in the medical\r\nprofession. Like the ladies, physicians have, in their periods of\r\nanger, been content with speaking ill of each other. That they have\r\nnot lost their power of courteous criticism and judicious abuse, any\r\none may learn, who, for a few hours, breathes the atmosphere of their\r\ncliques. It is good to hear an allopathic physician perform his duty\r\nto society by frankly stating his opinion of the character and conduct\r\nof an eminent homœopathic practitioner. Perhaps it is better still\r\nto listen to an apostle of homœopathy, when he takes up his parable\r\nand curses the hosts of allopathy. \"Sir, I tell you in confidence,\"\r\nobserved a distinguished man of science, tapping his auditor on the\r\nshoulder, and mysteriously whispering in his ear, \"I know _things_\r\nabout _that man_ that would make him end his days in penal servitude.\"\r\nThe next day the auditor was closeted in the consulting-room of _that\r\nman_, when that man said--quite in confidence, pointing as he spoke to\r\na strong box, and jingling a bunch of keys in his pocket--\"I have\r\n_papers_ in that box, which, properly used, would tie a certain friend\r\nof ours up by the neck.\"\r\n\r\nLettsom, loose-living man though he was for a member of the Society of\r\nFriends, had enough of the Quaker element in him to be very fond of\r\ncontroversy. He dearly loved to expose quackery, and in some cases did\r\ngood service in that way. In the _Medical Journal_ he attacked, A. D.\r\n1806, no less a man than Brodum, the proprietor of the Nervous\r\nCordial, avowing that that precious compound had killed thousands; and\r\nalso stating that Brodum had added to the crime of wholesale murder\r\nthe atrocities of having been born a Jew, of having been a shoe-black\r\nin Copenhagen, and of having at some period of his chequered career\r\ncarried on an ignoble trade in oranges. Of course Brodum saw his\r\nadvantage. He immediately brought an action against Phillips, the\r\nproprietor of the _Medical Journal_, laying his damages at £5000. The\r\nlawyers anticipated a harvest from the case, and were proceeding not\r\nonly against Phillips, but various newsvendors also, when a newspaper\r\neditor stept in between Phillips and Brodum, and contrived to settle\r\nthe dispute. Brodum's terms were not modest ones. He consented to\r\nwithdraw his actions, if the name of the author was given up, and if\r\nthe author would whitewash him in the next number of the Journal,\r\nunder the same signature. Lettsom consented, paid the two attorneys'\r\nbills, amounting to £390, and wrote the required puff of Brodum and\r\nhis Nervous Cordial.\r\n\r\nOne of the singular characters of Dublin, a generation ago, was John\r\nBrenan, M.D., a physician who edited the _Milesian Magazine_, a\r\nscurrilous publication of the satirist class, that flung dirt on every\r\none dignified enough for the mob to take pleasure in seeing him\r\nbespattered with filth. The man certainly was a great blackguard, but\r\nwas not destitute of wit. How he carried on the war with the members\r\nof his own profession the following song will show:--\r\n\r\n          \"THE DUBLIN DOCTORS.\r\n\r\n    \"My gentle muse, do not refuse\r\n    To sing the

justice) was as ready to fell a professional\r\nantagonist and brother with a bludgeon, hunting-whip, or pistol, as he\r\nwas to scarify him with doggerel. He was as bold a fellow as Dr.\r\nWalsh, the Hibernian Æsculapius, who did his best to lay Dr. Andrew\r\nMarshall down amongst the daisies and the dead men. Andrew Marshall,\r\nwhen a divinity-student at Edinburgh, was insulted (whilst officiating\r\nfor Stewart, the humanity professor) by a youngster named Macqueen.\r\nThe insolence of the lad was punished by the professor (_pro tem._)\r\ngiving him a caning. Smarting with the indignity offered him, Macqueen\r\nran home to his father, imploring vengeance; whereupon the irate sire\r\npromptly sallied forth, and entering Marshall's lodgings, exclaimed:--\r\n\r\n\"Are you the scoundrel that dared to attack my son?\"\r\n\r\n\"Draw and defend yourself!\" screamed the divinity student, springing\r\nfrom his chair, and presenting a sword-point at the intruder's breast.\r\nOld Macqueen, who had expected to have to deal only with a timid\r\nhalf-starved usher ready to crouch whiningly under personal\r\ncastigation, was so astonished at this reception that he turned and\r\nfled precipitately. This little affair happened in 1775. As a\r\nphysician Andrew Marshall was not less valiant than he had been when\r\na student of theology. On Walsh challenging him, he went out and stood\r\nup at ten paces like a gentleman. Walsh, a little short fellow,\r\ninvisible when looked at side-ways, put himself in the regular\r\nattitude, shoulder to the front. Marshall disdained such mean\r\nprudence, and faced his would-be murdered with his cheeks and chest\r\ninflated to the utmost. Shots were exchanged, Dr. Andrew Marshall\r\nreceiving a ball in his right arm, and Dr. Walsh, losing a lock of\r\nhair--snipped off by his opponent's bullet, and scattered by the\r\namorous breeze. Being thus the _gainer_ in the affair, Dr. Andrew\r\nMarshall made it up with his adversary, and they lived on friendly\r\nterms ever afterwards. Why don't some of our living _medici_ bury the\r\nhatchet with a like effective ceremony?\r\n\r\nAn affair that ended not less agreeably was that in which Dr.\r\nBrocklesby was concerned as principal, where the would-be belligerents\r\nleft the ground without exchanging shots, because their seconds could\r\nnot agree on the right number of paces at which to stick up their man.\r\nWhen Akenside was fool enough to challenge Ballow, a wicked story went\r\nabout that the fight didn't come off because one had determined never\r\nto fight in the morning, and the other that he would never fight in\r\nthe afternoon. But the fact was--Ballow was a paltry mean fellow, and\r\nshirked the peril into which his ill-manners had brought him. The\r\nlively and pleasant author of \"Physic and Physicians,\" countenancing\r\nthis unfair story, reminds us of the off-hand style of John Wilkes in\r\nsuch little affairs. When asked by Lord Talbot \"How many times they\r\nwere to fire?\" the brilliant demagogue responded--\r\n\r\n\"Just as often as your Lordship pleases--I have brought _a bag of\r\nbullets and a flask of gunpowder_ with me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nTHE LOVES OF PHYSICIANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHonour has flowed to physicians by the regular channels of\r\nprofessional duty in but scant allowance. Their children have been\r\nfrequently ennobled by marriage or for political services. Sir Hans\r\nSloane's daughter Elizabeth, and manor of Chelsea, passed into the\r\nCadogan family, the lady marrying the second Baron Cadogan. Like Sir\r\nHans, Dr. Huck Sanders left behind him two daughters, co-heiresses of\r\nhis wealth, of whom one (Jane) was ennobled through wedlock, the tenth\r\nEarl of Westmoreland raising her to be his second wife. Lord\r\nCombermere married the heiress of Dr. Gibbings, of Cork. In the same\r\nway Dr. Marwood's property came to the present Sir Marwood Elton by\r\nthe marriage of his grandfather with Frances, the daughter and heiress\r\nof the Devonshire doctor. On the other hand, as instances of the\r\noffspring of physicians exalted to the ranks of the aristocracy for\r\ntheir political services, the Lords Sidmouth, Denman, and Kingsdown\r\nmay be mentioned. Henry Addington, created Viscount Sidmouth, of the\r\ncounty of Devon, was the eldest son of Anthony Addington, M.D., of\r\nReading--the physician who objected to fighting any brother physician\r\nwho had not graduated at either Oxford or Cambridge. Dr. Anthony was\r\nthe enthusiastic toady of the great Earl of Chatham. Devoted to his\r\nown interests and the Pitt family, he rose from the humble position of\r\nkeeper of a provincial lunatic asylum to eminence in the medical\r\nprofession. Coming up to town in 1754, under the patronage of Pitt, he\r\nsucceeded in gaining the confidence of the Court, and was, with Dr.\r\nRichard Warren, Dr. Francis Willis, Dr. Thomas Gisborne, Sir Lucas\r\nPepys, and Dr. Henry Revell Reynolds, examined, in 1782, by the\r\ncommittee appointed to examine \"the physicians who attended his\r\nillness, touching the state of his Majesty's health.\" He took a very\r\nhopeful view of the king's case; and on being asked the foundation of\r\nhis hopes, alluded to his experience in the treatment of the insane at\r\nReading. The doctor had himself a passion for political intrigue,\r\nwhich descended to his son. The career of this son, who raised himself\r\nto the Speaker's chair in the House of Commons, to the dignity of\r\nFirst Minister of the Crown, and to the peerage of the realm, is\r\nmatter of history.\r\n\r\nLord Denman was closely connected with the medical profession by\r\nfamily ties: his father being Dr. Denman, of Mount Street, Grosvenor\r\nSquare, the author of a well-known work on a department of his\r\nprofession; his uncle being Dr. Joseph Denman of Bakewell; and his two\r\nsisters having married two eminent physicians, Margaret being the wife\r\nof Sir Richard Croft, Bart., and Sophia the wife of Dr. Baillie. Lord\r\nKingsdown's medical ancestor was his grandfather, Edward Pemberton,\r\nM.D., of Warrington.\r\n\r\nBut though the list of the ennobled descendants of medical\r\npractitioners might be extended to the limits of a volume, the writer\r\nof these pages is not aware of any case in which a doctor has, by the\r\nexercise of his calling, raised himself to the peerage. As yet, the\r\ndignity of a baronetcy is the highest honour conferred on the most\r\nillustrious of the medical faculty, Sir Hans Sloane being the first of\r\nthe order to whom that rank was presented. More than once a physician\r\nhas won admission into the _noblesse_, but the battle resulting in\r\nsuch success has been fought in the arena of politics or the bustle of\r\nthe law courts. Sylvester Douglas deserted the counter, at which he\r\ncommenced life an apothecary, and after a prolonged servitude to, or\r\nwarfare with, the cliques of the House of Commons, had his exertions\r\nrewarded and his ambition gratified with an Irish peerage and a\r\npatrician wife. On his elevation he was of course taunted with the\r\nhumility of his origin, and by none was the reproach flung at him with\r\ngreater bitterness than it was by a brother _parvenu_ and brother\r\npoet.\r\n\r\n\"What's his title to be?\" asked Sheridan, as he was playing at cards;\r\n\"what's Sylvester Douglas to be called?\"\r\n\r\n\"Lord Glenbervie,\" was the answer.\r\n\r\n\"Good Lord!\" replied Sheridan; and then he proceeded to fire off an\r\n_impromptu_, which he had that morning industriously prepared in bed,\r\nand which he subsequently introduced into one of his best satiric\r\npieces.\r\n\r\n    \"Glenbervie, Glenbervie,\r\n      What's good for the scurvy?\r\n    For ne'er be your old trade forgot.\r\n      In your arms rather quarter\r\n      A pestle and mortar,\r\n    And your crest be a spruce gallipot.\"\r\n\r\nThe brilliant partizan and orator displayed more wit, if not better\r\ntaste, in his ridicule of Addington, who, in allusion to the rise of\r\nhis father from a humble position in the medical profession, was\r\nordinarily spoken of by political opponents as \"The Doctor.\" On one\r\noccasion, when the Scotch members who usually supported Addington\r\nvoted in a body with the opposition, Sheridan, with a laugh of\r\ntriumph, fired off a happy mis-quotation from Macbeth,--\"Doctor, the\r\nThanes fly from thee.\"\r\n\r\nHenry Bickersteth, Lord Langdale, was the luckiest of physicians and\r\nlawyers. He used the medical profession as a stepping-stone, and the\r\nlegal profession as a ladder, and had the fortune to win two of the\r\nbrightest prizes of life--wealth and a peerage--without the\r\nhumiliation and toil of serving a political party in the House of\r\nCommons. The second son of a provincial surgeon, he was apprenticed to\r\nhis father, and educated for the paternal calling. On being qualified\r\nto kill, he became medical attendant to the late Earl of Oxford,\r\nduring that nobleman's travels on the Continent. Returning to his\r\nnative town, Kirby Lonsdale, he for awhile assisted his father in the\r\nmanagement of his practice; but resolved on a different career from\r\nthat of a country doctor, he became a member of Caius College,\r\nCambridge, and devoted himself to mathematical study with such success\r\nthat, in 1808, when he was twenty-eight years old, he became Senior\r\nWrangler and First Smith's prizeman. As late as the previous year he\r\nwas consulted medically by his father. In 1811 he was called to the\r\nbar by the Inner Temple, and from that time till his elevation to the\r\nMastership of the Rolls he was both the most hard-working and\r\nhard-worked of the lawyers in the Equity Courts, to which he confined\r\nhis practice. In 1827 he became a bencher of his Inn; and, in 1835,\r\nalthough he was a staunch and zealous liberal, and a strenuous\r\nadvocate of Jeremy Bentham's opinions, he was offered a seat on the\r\njudicial bench by Sir Robert Peel. This offer he declined, though he\r\nfully appreciated the compliment paid him by the Tory chieftain. He\r\nhad not, however, to wait long for his promotion. In the following\r\nyear (1836) he was, by his own friends, made Master of the Rolls, and\r\ncreated a peer of the realm, with the additional honour of being a\r\nPrivy-Councillor. His Lordship died at Tunbridge Wells, in 1851, in\r\nhis sixty-eighth year. It would be difficult to point to a more\r\nenviable career in legal annals than that of this medical lawyer, who\r\nwon the most desirable honours of his profession without ever sitting\r\nin the House of Commons, or acting as a legal adviser of the\r\nCrown--and when he had not been called quite twenty-five years. To\r\ngive another touch to this picture of a successful life, it may be\r\nadded, that Lord Langdale, after rising to eminence, married\r\nElizabeth, daughter of the Earl of Oxford, to whom he had formerly\r\nbeen travelling medical attendant.\r\n\r\nLove has not unfrequently smiled on doctors, and elevated them to\r\npositions at which they would never have arrived by their professional\r\nlabours. Sir Lucas Pepys, who married the Countess De Rothes, and Sir\r\nHenry Halford, whose wife was a daughter of the eleventh Lord St. John\r\nof Blestoe, are conspicuous amongst the more modern instances of\r\nmedical practitioners advancing their social condition by aristocratic\r\nalliances. Not less fortunate was the farcical Sir John Hill, who\r\ngained for a bride the Honourable Miss Jones, a daughter of Lord\r\nRanelagh--a nobleman whose eccentric opinion, that the welfare of the\r\ncountry required a continual intermixture of the upper and lower\r\nclasses of society, was a frequent object of ridicule with the\r\ncaricaturists and lampoon-writers of his time. But the greatest prize\r\never made by an Æsculapius in the marriage-market was that acquired by\r\nSir Hugh Smithson, who won the hand of Percy's proud heiress, and was\r\ncreated Duke of Northumberland. The son of a Yorkshire baronet's\r\nyounger son, Hugh Smithson was educated for an apothecary--a vocation\r\nabout the same time followed for several years by Sir Thomas Geery\r\nCullum, before he succeeded to the family estate and dignity. Hugh\r\nSmithson's place of business was Hatton Garden, but the length of time\r\nthat he there presided over a pestle and mortar is uncertain. In 1736\r\nhe became a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, but he withdrew from\r\nthat learned body, on the books of which his signature may be found,\r\nin the year 1740. A few months after this secession, Sir Hugh led to\r\nthe altar the only child and heiress of Algernon Seymour, Duke of\r\nSomerset. There still lives a tradition that the lady made the offer\r\nto Sir Hugh immediately after his rejection by a famous belle of\r\nprivate rank and modest wealth. Another version of the story is that,\r\nwhen she heard of his disappointment, she observed publicly, \"that the\r\ndisdainful beauty was a fool, and that no other woman in England would\r\nbe guilty of like folly.\" On hearing this, the baronet, a singularly\r\nhandsome man, took courage to sue for that to which men of far higher\r\nrank would not have presumed to aspire. The success that followed his\r\ndaring, of course, brought upon him the arrows of envy. He had won so\r\nmuch, however, that he could, without ill-humour, bear being laughed\r\nat. On being created Duke of Northumberland in 1766, he could afford\r\nto smile at a proposition that his coronet should be surrounded with\r\nsenna, instead of strawberry-leaves; for, however much obscure\r\njealousy might affect to contemn him, he was no fit object for\r\ndisdain--but a gentleman of good intellect and a lordly presence, and\r\n(though he had mixed drugs behind a counter) descended from an old and\r\nhonourable family. The reproach of being a Smithson, and no Percy, had\r\nmore force when applied to the second duke in the Anti-Jacobin, than\r\nit had when hurled vindictively at the ex-doctor himself by the\r\nmediocrities of the _beau monde_, whom he had beaten on their own\r\nground by superior attractions and accomplishments.\r\n\r\n    \"Nay,\" quoth the Duke, \"in thy black scroll\r\n      Deductions I espye--\r\n    For those who, poor, and mean, and low,\r\n      With children burthen'd lie.\r\n\r\n    \"And though full sixty thousand pounds\r\n      My vassals pay to me,\r\n    From Cornwall to Northumberland,\r\n      Through many a fair countree;\r\n\r\n    \"Yet England's church, its king, its laws,\r\n      Its cause I value not,\r\n    Compared with this, my constant text,\r\n      _A penny saved is got_.\r\n\r\n    \"No drop of princely Percy's blood\r\n      Through these cold veins doth run;\r\n    With Hotspur's castles, blazon, name,\r\n      I still am _poor_ Smithson.\"\r\n\r\nConsidering the opportunities that medical men have for pressing a\r\nsuit in love, and the many temptations to gentle emotion that they\r\nexperience in the aspect of feminine suffering, and the confiding\r\ngratitude of their fair patients, it is perhaps to be wondered at that\r\nonly one medical duke is to be found in the annals of the peerage.\r\nWhen Swift's Stella was on her death-bed, her physician said,\r\nencouragingly--\"Madam, you are certainly near the bottom of the hill,\r\nbut we shall endeavour to get you up once more,\" the _naïve_ reply of\r\nthe poor lady was, \"Doctor, I am afraid I shall be out _of breath_\r\nbefore I get to the top again.\" Not less touching was the fear\r\nexpressed by Steele's merry daughter to her doctor, that she should\r\n\"die _before the holidays_.\" Both Stella and Sir Richard's child had\r\nleft their personal charms behind them when they so addressed their\r\nphysicians; but imagine, my brother, what the effect of such words\r\nwould be on your susceptible heart, if they came from the lips of a\r\nbeautiful girl. Would you not (think you) try to win other such\r\nspeeches from her?--and if you tried, dear sir, surely _you_ would\r\nsucceed!\r\n\r\nPrudence would order a physician, endowed with a heart, to treat it in\r\nthe same way as Dr. Glynn thought a cucumber ought to be dressed--to\r\nslice it very thin, pepper it plentifully, pour upon it plenty of the\r\nbest vinegar, and then--throw it away. A doctor has quite enough work\r\non his hands to keep the affections of his patients in check, without\r\nhaving to mount guard over his own emotions. Thackeray says that girls\r\nmake love in the nursery, and practise the arts of coquetry on the\r\npage-boy who brings the coals upstairs--a hard saying for simple young\r\ngentlemen triumphing in the possession of a _first_ love. The writer\r\nof these pages could point to a fair dame, who enjoys rank amongst the\r\nhighest and wealth equal to the station assigned her by the heralds,\r\nwho not only aimed tender glances, and sighed amorously to a young\r\nwaxen-faced, blue-eyed apothecary, but even went so far as to write\r\nhim a letter proposing an elopement, and other merry arrangements, in\r\nwhich a carriage, everlastingly careering over the country at the\r\nheels of four horses, bore a conspicuous part. The silly maiden had,\r\nlike Dinah, \"a fortune in silvyer and gold,\" amounting to £50,000, and\r\nher blue-eyed Adonis was twice her age; but fortunately he was a\r\ngentleman of honour, and, without divulging the mad proposition of the\r\nyoung lady, he induced her father to take her away for twelve months'\r\nchange of air and scene. Many years since the heroine of this little\r\nepisode, after she had become the wife of a very great man, and the\r\nmother of children who bid fair to become ornaments to their\r\nillustrious race, expressed her gratitude cordially to this Joseph of\r\nthe doctors, for his magnanimity in not profiting by the absurd\r\nfancies of a child, and the delicacy with which he had taken prompt\r\nmeasures for her happiness; and, more recently, she manifested her\r\ngood will to the man who had offered her what is generally regarded as\r\nthe greatest insult a woman can experience, by procuring a commission\r\nin the army for his eldest son.\r\n\r\nThe embarrassments Sir John Eliot suffered under from the emotional\r\novertures of his fair patients are well known. St. John Long himself\r\nhad not more admirers amongst the _élite_ of high-born English ladies.\r\nThe king had a strong personal dislike to Sir John,--a dislike\r\npossibly heightened by a feeling that it was sheer impudence in a\r\ndoctor to capture without an effort the hearts of half the prettiest\r\nwomen amongst his subjects--and then shrug his shoulders with chagrin\r\nat his success. Lord George Germain had hard work to wring a baronetcy\r\nout of his Majesty for this victim of misplaced affection.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the king, at last grudgingly promising to make Eliot a\r\nbaronet--\"my Lord, since you desire it, let it be; but remember he\r\nshall not be my physician.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir,\" answered Lord George--\"he shall be your Majesty's baronet,\r\nand my physician.\"\r\n\r\nAmongst other plans Sir John resorted to, to scare away his patients\r\nand patronesses, he had a death's-head painted on his carriage-panels;\r\nbut the result of this eccentric measure on his practice and on his\r\nsufferings was the reverse of what he desired. One lady--the daughter\r\nof a noble member of a Cabinet--ignorant that he was otherwise\r\noccupied, made him an offer, and on learning to her astonishment that\r\nhe was a married man, vowed that she would not rest till she had\r\nassassinated his wife.\r\n\r\nPoor Radcliffe's loves were of a less flattering sort, though they\r\nresembled Sir John Eliot's in respect of being instances of\r\nreciprocity all on one side. But the amorous follies of Radcliffe,\r\nludicrous though they became under the touches of Steele's pen, are\r\ndignified and manly when compared with the senile freaks of Dr. Mead,\r\nwhose highest delight was to comb the hair of the lady on whom, for\r\nthe time being, his affections were set.\r\n\r\nDr. Cadogan, of Charles the Second's time, was, like Sir John Eliot, a\r\nfavourite with the ladies. His wont was to spend his days in shooting\r\nand his evenings in flirtation. To the former of these tastes the\r\nfollowing lines refer:--\r\n\r\n    \"Doctor, all game you either ought to shun,\r\n    Or sport no longer with the unsteady gun;\r\n    But like physicians of undoubted skill,\r\n    Gladly attempt what never fails to kill,\r\n    Not lead's uncertain dross, but physic's deadly pill.\"\r\n\r\nWhether he was a good shot we cannot say; but he was sufficiently\r\nadroit as a squire of dames, for he secured as his wife a wealthy\r\nlady, over whose property he had unfettered control. Against the\r\nmoney, however, there were two important points figuring under the\r\nhead of \"set-off\"--the bride was old and querulous. Of course such a\r\nwoman was unfitted to live happily with an eminent physician, on whom\r\nbevies of court ladies smiled whenever he went west of Charing Cross.\r\nAfter spending a few months in alternate fits of jealous hate and\r\njealous fondness, the poor creature conceived the terrible fancy that\r\nher husband was bent on destroying her with poison, and so ridding his\r\nlife of her execrable temper. One day, when surrounded by her friends,\r\nand in the presence of her lord and master, she fell on her back in a\r\nstate of hysterical spasms, exclaiming:--\r\n\r\n\"Ah! he has killed me at last. I am poisoned!\"\r\n\r\n\"Poisoned!\" cried the lady-friends, turning up the whites of their\r\neyes. \"Oh! gracious goodness!--you have done it, doctor!\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you accuse me of?\" asked the doctor, with surprise.\r\n\r\n\"I accuse you--of--killing me--ee,\" responded the wife, doing her best\r\nto imitate a death-struggle.\r\n\r\n\"Ladies,\" answered the doctor, with admirable _nonchalance_, bowing to\r\nMrs. Cadogan's bosom associates, \"it is perfectly false. You are quite\r\nwelcome to open her at once, and then you'll discover the calumny.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Hunter administered a scarcely less startling reproof to his\r\nwife, who, though devoted in her attachment to him, and in every\r\nrespect a lady worthy of esteem, caused her husband at times no little\r\nvexation by her fondness for society. She was in the habit of giving\r\nenormous routs, at which authors and artists, of all shades of merit\r\nand demerit, used to assemble to render homage to her literary powers,\r\nwhich were very far from common-place. A lasting popularity has\r\nattested the excellence of her song:--\r\n\r\n    \"My mother bids me bind my hair\r\n      With bands of rosy hue;\r\n    Tie up my sleeves with ribbons rare,\r\n      And lace my boddice blue.\r\n\r\n    \"'For why,' she cries, 'sit still and weep,\r\n      While others dance and play?'\r\n    Alas! I scarce can go or creep,\r\n      While Lubin is away.\r\n\r\n    \"'Tis sad to think the days are gone,\r\n      When those we love are near;\r\n    I sit upon this mossy stone,\r\n      And sigh when none can hear.\r\n\r\n    \"And while I spin my flaxen thread,\r\n      And sing my simple lay,\r\n    The village seems asleep or dead,\r\n      Now Lubin is away.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Hunter had no sympathy with his wife's poetical aspirations,\r\nstill less with the society which those aspirations led her to\r\ncultivate. Grudging the time which the labours of practice prevented\r\nhim from devoting to the pursuits of his museum and laboratory he\r\ncould not restrain his too irritable temper when Mrs. Hunter's\r\nfrivolous amusements deprived him of the quiet requisite for study.\r\nEven the fee of a patient who called him from his dissecting\r\ninstruments could not reconcile him to the interruption. \"I must go,\"\r\nhe would say reluctantly to his friend Lynn, when the living summoned\r\nhim from his investigations among the dead, \"and earn this d----d\r\nguinea, or I shall be sure to want it to-morrow.\" Imagine the wrath of\r\nsuch a man, finding, on his return from a long day's work, his house\r\nfull of musical professors, connoisseurs, and fashionable idlers--in\r\nfact, all the confusion and hubbub and heat of a grand party, which\r\nhis lady had forgotten to inform him was that evening to come off!\r\nWalking straight into the middle of the principal reception-room, he\r\nfaced round and surveyed his unwelcome guests, who were not a little\r\nsurprised to see him--dusty, toilworn, and grim--so unlike what \"the\r\nman of the house\" ought to be on such an occasion.\r\n\r\n\"I knew nothing,\" was his brief address to the astounded crowd--\"I\r\nknew nothing of this kick-up, and I ought to have been informed of it\r\nbeforehand; but, as I have now returned home to study, I hope the\r\npresent company will retire.\"\r\n\r\nMrs Hunter's drawing-rooms were speedily empty.\r\n\r\nOne of the drollest love stories in medical ana is that which relates\r\nto Dr. Thomas Dawson, a century since alike admired by the inhabitants\r\nof Hackney as a pulpit orator and a physician. Dawson was originally a\r\nSuffolk worthy, unconnected, however, with the eccentric John Dawson,\r\nwho, in the reign of Charles the Second, was an apothecary in the\r\npleasant old town of Framlingham, in that county. His father, a\r\ndissenting minister, had seven sons, and educated six of them for the\r\nNonconformist pulpit. Of these six, certainly three joined the\r\nEstablished Church, and became rectors--two of the said three,\r\nBenjamin and Abraham, being controversial writers of considerable\r\nmerit. Thomas Dawson adhered to the tenets of his father, and,\r\ncombining the vocations of divine and physic-man, preached on Sundays,\r\nand doctored during the rest of the week. He was Mead and Mead's\r\nfather in one: though the conditions of human existence, which render\r\nit impossible for one person to be in two places at the same time,\r\nprevented him from leaving chapel to visit his patients, and the next\r\nminute urging the congregation to offer up a prayer for the welfare of\r\nthe unfortunate sufferers. Amongst the doctor's circle of acquaintance\r\nMiss Corbett of Hackney was at the same time the richest, the most\r\ndevout, and the most afflicted in bodily health. Ministering to her\r\nbody and soul, Dr. Dawson had frequent occasions for visiting her. One\r\nday he found her alone, sitting with the large family Bible before\r\nher, meditating on perhaps the grandest chapter in all the Old\r\nTestament. The doctor read the words to which the forefinger of her\r\nright hand pointed--the words of Nathan to David: \"_Thou art the\r\nman_.\" The doctor took the hint; and on the 29th of May, 1758, he\r\nfound a wife--and the pious lady won a husband. The only offspring of\r\nthis strange match was one son, a Mr. Dawson, who still resides at a\r\nvery advanced age of life in the charming village of Botesdale, in\r\nSuffolk. When the writer of these pages was a happy little boy, making\r\nhis first acquaintance with Latin and Greek, at the Botesdale Grammar\r\nSchool, then presided over by the pious, manly, and gentle ----, he\r\nwas an especial pet with Mr. Dawson. The worthy gentleman's little\r\nhouse was in the centre of a large garden, densely stocked with apple\r\nand other fruit trees; and in it he led a very retired life, visited\r\nby only a very few friends, and tended by two or three servants--of\r\nwhom one, an ancient serving man, acted as a valet, gardener, and\r\ngroom to an antique horse which constituted Mr. Dawson's entire stud.\r\nThe small urchin before-mentioned had free access at all times to the\r\nvenerable gentleman, and used to bring him the gossip of the town and\r\nschool, in exchange for apples and other substantial gifts. Thin and\r\nattenuated, diminutive, so as to be little more than a dwarf, with\r\nvagrant eager eye, hooked as to his nose, and with a long beard,\r\nsnowy-white, streaming over his waistcoat, the octogenarian used to\r\nreceive his fair-haired child-visitor. May he be happy--as may all old\r\ngentlemen be, who are kind to little schoolboys, and give them apples\r\nand \"tips!\"\r\n\r\nThe day that Abernethy was married he went down to the lecture-room to\r\ndeliver his customary instruction to his pupils. His selection of a\r\nwife was as judicious as his marriage was happy; and the funny\r\nstories for long current about the mode in which he made his offer are\r\nknown to be those most delusive of fabrications, fearless and extreme\r\nexaggerations of a little particle of the truth. The brutality of\r\nprocedure attributed to the great surgeon by current rumour was\r\naltogether foreign to his nature. The Abernethy biscuit was not more\r\naudaciously pinned upon his reputation, than was the absurd falsehood\r\nthat when he made his offer to his future wife he had only seen her\r\nonce, and then wrote saying he should like to marry her, but as he was\r\ntoo busy to \"make love,\" she must entertain his proposal without\r\nfurther preliminaries, and let him know her decision by the end of the\r\nweek.\r\n\r\nOf Sir John Eliot the fortunate, mention has already been made in this\r\nchapter. Let us now speak of John Eliot, the luckless hero of a\r\nbiography published in 1787, under the title of \"A Narrative of the\r\nLife and Death of John Eliot, M.D., containing an account of the Rise,\r\nProgress, and Catastrophe of his unhappy passion for Miss Mary\r\nBoydell.\" A native of Somersetshire, John Elliot wrote a tragedy when\r\nonly twelve years of age, and after serving an apprenticeship to a\r\nLondon apothecary, fell in love with one Miss Mary Boydell, a niece of\r\na city alderman. The course of this gentleman's love ran smoothly till\r\nhe chanced, by evil fortune, to read an announcement in a newspaper,\r\nthat a Miss Boydell had, on the previous day, been led to the altar by\r\nsome gentleman--not called Dr. John Elliot, certainly not himself.\r\nNever doubting that _the_ Miss Boydell of the newspaper was _his_ Miss\r\nBoydell, the doctor, without making any further inquiries after the\r\nperfidious fair one, sold his shop and fixtures, and ran off from the\r\nevil city of heartless women, to commune with beasts of the field and\r\nbirds of the air in sylvan retirement. Not a little chagrined was Miss\r\nBoydell at the sudden disappearance of her ideal apothecary, whom her\r\nuncle, the alderman, stigmatized in round, honest, indignant language,\r\nas a big blackguard. After twelve years spent in wandering, \"a forlorn\r\nwretch, over the kingdom,\" Dr. Elliott returned to London, set up once\r\nmore in business, and began, for a second time, to drive a thriving\r\ntrade, when Delilah again crossed his path. \"One day,\" he says,\r\ntelling his own story, \"entering my shop (for I had commenced again\r\nthe business of apothecary) I found two ladies sitting there, one of\r\nwhom I thought I could recognize. As soon as she observed me, she\r\ncried out, 'Mr. Elliot! Mr. Elliot!' and fell back in a swoon. The\r\nwell-known voice struck me like a shock of electricity--my affections\r\ninstantly gushed forth--I fell senseless at her feet. When I came to\r\nmyself, I found Miss Boydell sitting by my side.\" And _his_ Miss\r\nBoydell was Miss Boydell still--innocent of wedlock.\r\n\r\nImogene being proved true, and Alonzo having come to life, the\r\nyouthful couple renewed the engagement entered into more than twelve\r\nyears before. The wedding-day was fixed, the wedding-clothes were\r\nprovided, when uncle (the alderman), distrustful that his niece's\r\nscranny lover would make a good husband, induced her at the last\r\nmoment to jilt him, and marry Mr. Nicols, an opulent bookseller. The\r\nfarce was now to wear an aspect of tragedy. Infuriated at being,\r\nafter all, _really_ deceived, Dr. Elliot bought two brace of pistols,\r\nand bound them together in pairs. One pair he loaded only with powder;\r\ninto the other he put the proper quantum of lead, as well as the\r\npernicious dust. Armed with these weapons, he lay in wait for the\r\ndestroyer of his peace. After some days of watching he saw her in\r\nPrince's Street, walking with the triumphant Nicols. Rushing up, he\r\nfired at her the two pistols (not loaded with ball), and then\r\nsnatching the other brace from his pocket, was proceeding to commit\r\nsuicide, when he was seized by the bystanders and disarmed.\r\n\r\nThe next scene in the drama was the principal court of the Old Bailey,\r\nwith Dr. Elliot in the dock, charged with an attempt to murder Miss\r\nBoydell. The jury, being satisfied that the pistols were not loaded\r\nwith ball, and that the prisoner only intended to create a startling\r\nimpression on Miss Boydell's mind, acquitted him of that charge, and\r\nhe was remanded to prison to take his trial for a common assault.\r\nBefore this second inquiry, however, could come off, the poor man died\r\nin Newgate, July 22, 1787, of a broken heart--or jail fever. Ere his\r\ndeath, he took a cruel revenge of the lady, by writing an\r\nautobiographic account of his love experiences, in which appeared the\r\nfollowing passage:--\"Fascinated as I was by the charms of this\r\nfaithless woman, I had long ceased to be sensible to these defects, or\r\nrather my impassioned imagination had converted them into perfections.\r\nBut those who did not labour under the power of this magic were struck\r\nby her ungraceful exterior, and mine ears have not unfrequently been\r\nshocked to hear the tongue of indifference pronounce that the object\r\nof my passion was _ugly and deformed_. Add to this, that Miss Boydell\r\nhas long since ceased to boast the bloom of youth, and then let any\r\nperson, impartial and unprejudiced, decide whether a passion for her,\r\nso violent as that I have manifested, could be the produce of a slight\r\nand recent acquaintance, or whether it must not rather be the\r\nconsequence of a long habit and inveterate intimacy.\" Such was the\r\nabsurd sad story of John Elliot, author of \"The Medical Almanack,\"\r\n\"Elements of the Branches of Natural Philosophy,\" and \"Experiments and\r\nObservations on Light and Colours.\"\r\n\r\nThe mournful love-story of Dr. John Elliot made a deep impression on\r\nthe popular mind. It is found alluded to in ballads and chap-books,\r\nand more than one penny romance was framed upon it. Not improbably it\r\nsuggested the composition of the following parody of Monk Lewis's\r\n\"Alonzo the Brave and the Fair Imogene,\" which appeared at the close\r\nof the last century, during the first run of popularity which that\r\nfamiliar ballad obtained:--\r\n\r\n           \"GILES BOLUS THE KNAVE AND BROWN\r\n                     SALLY GREEN.\r\n\r\n             \"A ROMANCE BY M. G. LEWIS.\r\n\r\n    \"A Doctor so grave and a virgin so bright,\r\n      Hob-a-nobbed in some right marasquin;\r\n    They swallowed the cordial with truest delight,\r\n    Giles Bolus the knave was just five feet in height,\r\n      And four feet the brown Sally Green.\r\n\r\n    \"'And as,' said Giles Bolus, 'to-morrow I go\r\n      To physic a feverish land,\r\n    At some sixpenny hop, or perhaps the mayor's show,\r\n    You'll tumble in love with some smart city beau,\r\n      And with him share your shop in the Strand.'\r\n\r\n    \"'Lord! how can you think so?' Brown Sally Green said,\r\n      'You must know mighty little of me;\r\n    For if you be living, or if you be dead,\r\n    I swear, 'pon my honour, that none in your stead,\r\n      Shall husband of Sally Green be.\r\n\r\n    \"'And if e'er I by love or by wealth led aside\r\n      Am false to Giles Bolus the knave;\r\n    God grant that at dinner so amply suppli'd,\r\n    Over-eating may give me a pain in the side,\r\n      May your ghost then bring rhubarb to physic the bride,\r\n    And send her well-dosed to the grave.'\r\n\r\n    \"To Jamaica the doctor now hastened for gold,\r\n      Sally wept till she blew her nose sore;\r\n    Yet scarce had a twelvemonth elaps'd, when behold!\r\n    A brewer quite stylish his gig that way roll'd,\r\n      And stopped it at Sally Green's door.\r\n\r\n    \"His barrels, his bungs, and his brass-headed cane,\r\n      Soon made her untrue to his vows;\r\n    The stream of small beer now bewildered her brain;\r\n    He caught her while tipsy--denials were vain--\r\n      So he carried her home as his spouse.\r\n\r\n    \"And now the roast-beef had been blest by the priest,\r\n      To cram now the guests had begun;\r\n    Tooth and nail, like a wolf, fell the bride on the feast\r\n    Nor yet had the clash of her knife and fork ceased,\r\n      When a bell (t'was the dustman's) toll'd one.\r\n\r\n    \"Then first, with amazement, brown Sally Green found,\r\n      That a stranger was stuck by her side.\r\n    His cravat and his ruffles with snuff were embrown'd;\r\n    He ate not--he drank not--but, turning him round,\r\n      Sent some pudding away to be fried.\r\n\r\n    \"His wig was turned forwards, and wort was his height,\r\n      His apron was dirty to view;\r\n    The women (oh! wondrous) were hushed at the sight,\r\n    The cats as they eyed him drew back (well they might),\r\n      For his body was pea-green and blue.\r\n\r\n    \"Now, as all wish'd to speak, but none knew what to say,\r\n      They look'd mighty foolish and queer:\r\n    At length spoke the lady with trembling--'I pray,\r\n    Dear sir, that your peruke aside you would lay,\r\n      And partake of some strong or small beer.'\r\n\r\n    \"The bride shuts her fly-trap--the stranger complies,\r\n      And his wig from his phiz deigns to pull.\r\n    Adzooks! what a squall Sally gave through surprise!\r\n    Like a pig that was stuck, how she opened her eyes,\r\n      When she recognized Giles's bare skull.\r\n\r\n    \"Each miss then exclaimed, while she turn'd up her snout,\r\n      'Sir, your head isn't fit to be seen!'--\r\n    The pot-boys ran in, and the pot-boys ran out,\r\n    And couldn't conceive what the noise was about,\r\n      While the doctor addressed Sally Green.\r\n\r\n    \"'Behold me, thou jilt-flirt! behold me!' he cri'd--\r\n      'I'm Bolus, whom some call the 'knave!'\r\n    God grant, that to punish your falsehood and pride,\r\n    You should feel at this moment a pain in your side.\r\n    Quick, swallow this rhubarb!--I'll physic the bride,\r\n      And send her well-dosed to the grave!'\r\n\r\n    \"Thus saying, the physic her throat he forced down,\r\n      In spite of whate'er she could say:\r\n    Then bore to his chariot the maiden so brown,\r\n    Nor ever again was she seen in that town,\r\n      Or the doctor who whisked her away.\r\n\r\n    \"Not long lived the brewer, and none since that time\r\n      To inhabit the brew-house presume;\r\n    For old women say that by order sublime\r\n    There Sally Green suffers the pain of her crime,\r\n      And bawls to get out of the room.\r\n\r\n    \"At midnight four times in each year does her sprite\r\n      With shrieks make the chamber resound.\r\n    'I won't take the rhubarb!' she squalls in affright,\r\n    While a cup in his left hand, a draught in his right,\r\n      Giles Bolus pursues her around.\r\n\r\n    \"With wigs so well powdered, twelve doctors so grave,\r\n      Dancing hornpipes around them are seen;\r\n    They drink chicken-broth, and this horrible stave\r\n    Is twanged through each nose, 'To Giles Bolus the knave,\r\n      And his patient the sick Sally Green.'\"\r\n\r\nIn the court of love, Dr. Van Buchell, the empiric, may pass muster as\r\na physician. When that droll charlatan lost his first wife, in 1775,\r\nhe paid her the compliment of preserving her body with great care. Dr.\r\nHunter, with the assistance of Mr. Cruikshank, injected the\r\nblood-vessels of the corpse with a carmine fluid, so that the cheeks\r\nand lips had the hue of healthy life; the cavities of the body were\r\nartistically packed with the antiseptics used by modern embalmers; and\r\nglass eyes were substituted in place of the filmy balls which Death\r\nhad made his own. Decked in a dainty apparel of lace and finest linen,\r\nthe body was then placed in a bed of thin paste of plaster of Paris,\r\nwhich, crystallizing, made a most ornamental couch. The case\r\ncontaining this fantastic horror had a glass lid, covered with a\r\ncurtain; and as Van Buchell kept it in his ordinary sitting-room, he\r\nhad the pleasure of introducing his visitors to the lifeless form of\r\nhis \"dear departed.\" For several years the doctor lived very happily\r\nwith this slough of an immortal soul--never quarrelling with it, never\r\nbeing scolded by it--on the whole, enjoying an amount of domestic\r\ntranquility that rarely falls to one man's lot. Unwisely he made in\r\nadvanced years a new alliance, and manifested a desire to be on with\r\nthe new and the old love at the same time. To this Mrs. Van Buchell\r\n(No. 2) strongly objected, and insisted that the quaint coffin of Mrs.\r\nVan Buchell (No. 1) should be removed from the parlour in which she\r\nwas expected to spend the greatest part of her days. The eccentric\r\nmode in which Buchell displayed his affection for his first wife was\r\nscarcely less repulsive than the devotion to the interests of\r\nanatomical science which induced Rondeletius to dissect the dead body\r\nof his own child in his theatre at Montpelier.\r\n\r\nAre there no more loves to be mentioned? Yes; let these concluding\r\npages tell an interesting story of the last generation.\r\n\r\nFifty years ago the picturesque, sunny town of Holmnook had for its\r\nphysician one Dr. Kemp, a grave and reverend Æsculapius, punctilious\r\nin etiquette, with an imposing formality of manner, accurate in\r\ncostume, in every respect a courtier of the old school. Holmnook is an\r\nantique market-town, square and compact, a capital in miniature, lying\r\nat the foot of an old feudal castle, in which the Bigods once held\r\nsway. That stronghold of moated towers was three centuries since the\r\nabode of a mighty Duke; Surrey, the poet earl, luckless and inspired,\r\nwas born within its walls. The noble acres of the princely house fell\r\ninto the hands of a _parvenu_--a rich, grasping lawyer;--that was bad.\r\nThe lawyer died and went to his place, leaving the land to the\r\npoor;--that was better. And now the produce of the rich soil, which\r\nwhilom sent forth a crop of mailed knights, supports a college of toil\r\nand time-worn peasants, saving their cold thin blood from the penury\r\nof the poor-house, and sheltering them from the contumelies\r\nof--Guardians of the Poor. Hard by the college, housing these ancient\r\nhumble children of man, is a school, based on the same beneficent\r\nfoundation, where the village lads are taught by as ripe a scholar and\r\ntrue a gentleman as ever came from the banks of Isis; and round which\r\ntemple of learning they play their rough, noisy games, under the\r\nobservation of the veterans of the bourg--the almsmen and almswomen\r\nwho sit in the sun and on benches before their college, clad in the\r\nblue coats of the charity, and feeling no shame in them, though the\r\narmorial badge of that old lawyer is tacked upon them in red cloth.\r\n\r\nHolmnook is unlike most other English towns of its size, abounding as\r\nit does in large antique mansions, formerly inhabited by the great\r\nofficers and dependents on the ducal household, who in many cases were\r\nblood relations of the duke himself. Under the capacious windows of\r\nthese old houses, in the streets, and round the market-square, run\r\nrows of limes, spreading their cool shade over the pinnacles of gabled\r\nroofs, and flinging back bars across the shining shingle which\r\ndecorates the plaster walls of the older houses. In the centre of the\r\ntown stands an enormous church, large enough to hold an entire army of\r\nChristians, and containing many imposing tombs of earls and leaders,\r\nlong since gone to their account.\r\n\r\nThink of this old town, its venerable dwellings--each by itself\r\nsuggesting a romance. Hear the cooing and lazy flapping of pigeons,\r\nmaking continual holiday round the massive chimneys. Observe, without\r\nseeming to observe, the mayor's pretty daughter sitting at the open\r\noriel window of the Guild-hall, merrily singing over her needle-work,\r\nand wondering if her bright ribbon has a good effect on passers below.\r\nHeed the jingle of a harpsichord in the rector's parlour. Be pleased\r\nto remember that the year is 1790--not 1860. Take a glass of stinging\r\nale at \"The Knight of Armour\" hostelry--and own you enjoy it. Take\r\nanother, creaming good-naturedly up under your lip, and confess you\r\nlike it better than its predecessor. See the High Sheriff's carriage\r\npass through the excited town, drawn by four enormous black horses,\r\nand having three Bacchic footmen hanging on behind. Do all this, and\r\nthen you'll have a faint notion of Holmnook, its un-English\r\npicturesqueness, its placid joy, and experience of pomp.\r\n\r\nWho is the gentleman emerging from the mansion on the causeway, in\r\nthis year 1790--with white peruke and long pig-tail, snuff-coloured\r\ncoat and velvet collar, tight dark nether garments, silk stockings,\r\nand shoes with buckles, volumes of white shirt-frill rising up under\r\nhis chin? As he taps his shoes on his doorstep you can see he is proud\r\nof his leg, a pleasant pride, whether one has reason for it or not!\r\n\r\nSeventy years of age, staid, decorous, and thoroughly versed in the\r\nsocial proprieties of the old world, now gone clean from us, like\r\nchivalry or chartism, Dr. Kemp was an important personage in Holmnook\r\nand its vicinity. An _éclat_ was his that a country doctor does not\r\nusually possess. For he was of gentle blood, being a cadet of an old\r\nand wealthy family on the other side of the country, the\r\nrepresentative of which hailed him \"cousin,\" and treated him with the\r\nintimacy of kinship--the kinship of 1790.\r\n\r\nMichael Kemp's youth had been spent away from Holmnook. Doubtless so\r\npolite and dignified a gentleman had once aimed at a brighter lot than\r\na rural physician's. Doubtless he had a history, but he kept it to\r\nhimself. He had never married! The rumour went that he had been\r\ndisappointed--had undertaken the conquest of a high-born lady, who\r\ngave another ending to the game; and having conquered him, went off to\r\nconquer others. Ladies could do such things in the last century--when\r\nmen had hearts.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, Michael Kemp, M.D., was an old bachelor, of spotless honour,\r\nand a reputation that scandal never dared to trifle with.\r\n\r\nA lady, much respected by the simple inhabitants of Holmsnook, kept\r\nhis house.\r\n\r\nLet us speak of her--fair and forty, comely, with matronly outlines,\r\nbut graceful. Pleasant of voice, cheerful in manner, active in\r\nbenevolence, Mistress Alice was a great favourite; no christening or\r\nwedding could go off without her for miles around. The doctor's\r\ngrandest patients treated her as an equal; for apart from her personal\r\nclaims to respect and good-will, she was, it was understood, of the\r\ndoctor's blood--a poor relation, gentle by birth as she was by\r\neducation. Mistress Alice was a great authority amongst the Holmnook\r\nladies, on all matters pertaining to dress and taste. Her own ordinary\r\ncostume was an artistic one. A large white kerchief, made so as to sit\r\nlike a jacket, close and high round the throat, concealed her fair\r\narms and shoulders, and reached down to the waist of her dress, which,\r\nin obedience to the fashion of the time, ran close beneath her arms.\r\nIn 1790 a lady's waist at Holmnook occupied just about the same place\r\nwhere the drapery of a London belle's Mazeppa harness offers its first\r\nconcealment to its wearer's charms. But it was on her foot-gear that\r\nMistress Alice devoted especial care. The short skirts of that day\r\nencouraged a woman to set her feet off to the best advantage. Mistress\r\nAlice wore natty high-heeled shoes and clocked stockings--bright\r\ncrimson stockings with yellow clocks.\r\n\r\nDo you know what clocked stockings were, ladies? This writer is not\r\ndeeply learned on such matters, but having seen a pair of Mistress\r\nAlice's stockings, he can tell you that they had on either side,\r\nextending from the heel upwards some six inches, flowers gracefully\r\nembroidered with a light yellow silk on the crimson ground. And these\r\nwreaths of broidery were by our ancestors called clocks. This writer\r\ncould tell something else about Mistress Alice's apparel. She had for\r\ngrand evenings of high festivity white kid gloves reaching up to the\r\nelbow, and having a slit at the tips of the forefinger and thumb of\r\neach hand. It was an ordinary fashion long syne. So, ladies could let\r\nout the tips of those digits to take a pinch of snuff!\r\n\r\nOne night Michael Kemp, M.D., Oxon., was called up to come with every\r\npossible haste to visit a sick lady, urgently in want of him. The\r\nnight-bell was rung violently, and the messenger cried to the doctor\r\nover and over from the pavement below to make good speed. The doctor\r\ndid his best to comply; but, as ill-luck would have it, after he had\r\nstruck a light the candle illumined by it fell down, and left the\r\ndoctor in darkness. This was very annoying to the good man, for he\r\ncould not reconcile it to his conscience to consume time in lighting\r\nanother, and yet it was hard for such a decorous man to make his hasty\r\ntoilet in the dark.\r\n\r\nHe managed, however, better than he expected. His peruke came to hand\r\nall right; so did the tight inexpressibles; so did the snuff-coloured\r\ncoat with high velvet collar; so did the buckled shoes. Bravo!\r\n\r\nIn another five minutes the active physician had groped his way\r\ndown-stairs, emerged from his stately dwelling, and had run to his\r\npatient's house.\r\n\r\nIn a trice he was admitted; in a twinkle he was up the stairs; in\r\nanother second he was by the sick lady's bedside, round which were\r\nseated a nurse and three eminent Holmnook gossips.\r\n\r\nHe was, however, little prepared for the reception he met with--the\r\neffect his appearance produced.\r\n\r\nThe sick lady, struggling though she was with severe pain, laughed\r\noutright.\r\n\r\nThe nurse said, \"Oh my!--Doctor Kemp!\"\r\n\r\nGossip No. 1 exclaimed, \"Oh, you'll kill me!\"\r\n\r\nGossip No. 2 cried, \"I can't believe my eyes!\"\r\n\r\nGossip No. 3 exploded with--\"Oh, Doctor Kemp, do look at your\r\nstockings!\"\r\n\r\nAnd the doctor, obeying, did look at his stockings. One was of black\r\nsilk--the other was a crimson one, with yellow clocks.\r\n\r\nWas there not merry talk the next day at Holmnook!

I see the\r\nblue heavens kissing thy limes!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nLITERATURE AND ART.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old proverb says, \"Every man is a physician or a fool by forty.\"\r\nSir Henry Halford happening to quote the old saw to a circle of\r\nfriends, Canning, with a pleasant humour smiling in his eyes,\r\ninquired, \"Sir Henry, mayn't he be both?\"\r\n\r\nJohn Locke, according to academic registration, was not a physician\r\ntill he was past forty. Born in 1632, he took his M.B. degree Feb.\r\n6th, 1674. To what extent he exercised his profession is still a\r\nmatter of dispute; but there is no doubt that he was for some period\r\nan active practitioner of it. Of his letters to Hans Sloane, that are\r\nstill extant, the following is one:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"DEAR SIR,--\r\n\r\n     \"I have a patient here sick of the fever at this season. It\r\n     seems not violent; but I am told 'tis a sort that is not\r\n     easily thrown off. I desire to know of you what your fevers\r\n     in town are, and what methods you find most successful in\r\n     them? I shall be obliged by your favour if you will give me\r\n     a word or two by to-morrow's post, and direct it to me, to\r\n     be left at Mr Harrison's, in the 'Crown,' at Harlow.\r\n\r\n                             \"I am, Sir,\r\n                               \"Your most humble servant,\r\n                                                    \"J LOCKE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPopularly the name of Locke is as little associated with the\r\nprofession of medicine as that of Sir James Mackintosh, who was a\r\npractising physician, till ambition and poverty made him select a more\r\nlucrative vocation, and turn his energies to the bar.\r\n\r\nDistinguished amongst literary physicians was Andrew Borde, who\r\nstudied Medicine at Oxford and Montpelier, and it is said acted as a\r\nphysician in the service of Henry the Eighth. Borde's career has\r\nhitherto been a puzzle to antiquaries who, though interested in it,\r\nhave been able to discover only little about it. It was his whim to\r\nsign himself Andrew Perforatus (his name really signifying \"a\r\ncottage,\"--\"bordarius=a cottager\"). In the same way after him Robert\r\nFludd, the Rosicrucian doctor, adopted for his signature Robertus de\r\nFluctibus. In his works he occasionally gives the reader a glimpse of\r\nhis personal adventures; and from contemporary literature, as well as\r\ntradition, we learn enough to feel justified in believing that he\r\ncreated the cant term \"Merry Andrew.\"\r\n\r\nOf his freaks, about the most absurd was his conduct when acting as\r\nforeman of a jury in a small borough town. A prisoner was charged with\r\nstealing a pair of leather breeches, but though appearances were\r\nstrongly against the accused (who was a notorious rogue), the evidence\r\nwas so defective that to return a verdict of guilty on the charge was\r\nbeyond the logic and conscience of the twelve good men and true. No\r\ncourse seemed open to them but to acquit the knave; when Andrew Borde\r\nprevailed on them, _as_ the evidence of stealing the leather breeches\r\nwas so defective, to bring him in guilty of manslaughter.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that the jurymen took Andrew's advice, and\r\nfinding a verdict to the best of those abilities with which it had\r\npleased God to bless them, astonished the judge and the public, not\r\nless than the prisoner, with the strange conclusion at which they had\r\narrived.\r\n\r\nAnthony à Wood and Hearne tell us the little that has hitherto been\r\nknown of this eccentric physician. To that little an important\r\naddition may be made from the following letter, never before\r\npublished, the original of which is in the State-Paper Office. The\r\nepistle is penned to Henry the Eighth's minister, Thomas Cromwell.\r\n\r\n                               \"Jesus.\r\n\r\n     \"Offering humbly salutacyon with dew reverance.

The public harbour towards them the same suspicious and\r\nunfavourable prejudices as they do to literary barristers. A man, it\r\nis presumed, cannot be a master of two trades at the same time, and\r\nwhere he professes to carry on two it is usually concluded that he\r\nunderstands neither. To display the injustice of such views is no part\r\nof this writer's work, for the task is in better hands--time and\r\nexperience, who are yearly adding to the cases that support the\r\nconverse proposition that if a man is really a proficient in one\r\nsubject, the fact is of itself a reason for believing him a master of\r\na second.\r\n\r\nStill, the number of brilliant writers who have enrolled themselves in\r\nthe medical fraternity is remarkable. If they derived no benefit from\r\ntheir order, they have at least generously conferred lustre upon it.\r\nGoldsmith--though no one can say on what his claim to the title of\r\ndoctor rested, and though in his luckless attempts to get medical\r\nemployment he underwent even more humiliation and disgrace than fell\r\nto his lot as the drudge of Mrs. Griffiths--is one of the most\r\npleasant associations that our countrymen have in connection with the\r\nhistory of \"the Faculty.\" Smollett, like Goldsmith, tried\r\nineffectually to escape from literary drudgery to the less irksome and\r\nmore profitable duties that surround the pestle and mortar. Of Garth,\r\nBlackmore, Arbuthnot, and Akenside, notice has already been taken.\r\n\r\nAnything like a complete enumeration of medical men who have made\r\nvaluable contributions to _belles lettres_ would fill a volume, by the\r\nwriting of which very little good would be attained. By no means the\r\nleast of them was Armstrong, whose portrait Thomson introduced into\r\nthe \"Castle of Indolence.\"\r\n\r\n    \"With him was sometimes joined in silken walk\r\n      (Profoundly silent--for they never spoke),\r\n    One shyer still, who quite detested talk;\r\n      If stung by spleen, at once away he broke\r\n      To grove of pine and broad o'ershadowing oak.\r\n    There, inly thrilled, he wandered all alone,\r\n      And on himself his pensive fury woke:\r\n    He never uttered word, save when first shone\r\n    The glittering star of eve--'Thank Heaven, the day is done.'\"\r\n\r\nHis medical writings, and his best known poem, \"The Art of Health,\"\r\nhad he written nothing else, would in all probability have brought him\r\npatients, but the licentiousness of \"The Economy of Love\" effectually\r\nprecluded him from ever succeeding as a family physician. Amongst\r\nArmstrong's poet friends was Grainger, the amiable and scholarly\r\nphysician who enjoyed the esteem of Percy and Samuel Johnson,\r\nShenstone and Sir Joshua. Soon after the publication of his\r\ntranslation of the \"Elegies of Tibullus,\" (1758), Grainger went to the\r\nisland of St. Christopher's, and established himself there as a\r\nphysician. The scenery and industrial occupations of the island\r\ninspired him to write his most important poem, \"The Sugar-Cane,\"\r\nwhich, in escaping such derision as was poured on Blackmore's\r\neffusions, owed its good fortune to the personal popularity of the\r\nauthor rather than its intrinsic merits. The following sample is a\r\nfair one:--\r\n\r\n    \"Destructive on the upland groves\r\n    The monkey nation preys: from rocky heights,\r\n    In silent parties they descend by night,\r\n    And posting watchful sentinels, to warn\r\n    When hostile steps approach, with gambols they\r\n    Pour o'er the cane-grove. Luckless he to whom\r\n    That land pertains! in evil hour, perhaps,\r\n    And thoughtless of to-morrow, on a die\r\n    He hazards millions; or, perhaps, reclines\r\n    On luxury's soft lap, the pest of wealth;\r\n    And, inconsiderate, deems his Indian crops\r\n    Will amply her insatiate wants supply.\r\n\r\n      \"From these insidious droles (peculiar pest\r\n    Of Liamigia's hills) would'st thou defen\r\n    Thy waving wealth, in traps put not thy trust,\r\n    However baited: treble every watch,\r\n    And well with arms provide them; faithful dogs,\r\n    Of nose sagacious, on their footsteps wait.\r\n    With these attack the predatory bands;\r\n    Quickly, th' unequal conflict they decline,\r\n    And chattering, fling their ill-got spoils away.\r\n    So when, of late, innumerous Gallic hosts,\r\n    Fierce, wanton, cruel, did by stealth invade\r\n    The peaceable American's domains,\r\n    While desolation mark'd their faithless rout;\r\n    No sooner Albion's martial sons advanc'd,\r\n    Than the gay dastards to their forests fled,\r\n    And left their spoils and tomahawks behind.\r\n      \"_Nor with less haste the whisker'd vermin race,\r\n    A countless clan, despoil the low-land cane._\r\n      \"These to destroy, &c.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the poem was read in MS. at Sir Joshua's house, the lines printed\r\nin italics were not part of the production, but in their place stood--\r\n\r\n              \"Now, Muse, let's sing of _rats_.\"\r\n\r\nThe immediate effect of such _bathos_ was a burst of inextinguishable\r\nlaughter from the auditors, whose sense of the ridiculous was by no\r\nmeans quieted by the fact that one of the company, slyly overlooking\r\nthe reader, discovered that \"the word had originally been _mice_, and\r\nhad been altered to _rats_, as more dignified.\"\r\n\r\nAbove the crowd of minor medical _litterateurs_ are conspicuous,\r\nMoore, the author of \"Zeluco\"; Dr. Aikin, one of whose many works has\r\nbeen already referred to; Erasmus Darwin, author of \"The Botanic\r\nGarden\"; Mason Good, the translator of \"Lucretius,\" and author of the\r\n\"Study of Medicine\"; Dr. Ferriar, whose \"Illustrations of Sterne\" just\r\ndoubled the value in the market of \"Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy\";\r\nCogan, the author of \"Life and Opinions of John Buncle, jun.\"; Dr.\r\nHarrington, of Bath, editor of the \"Nugæ Antiquæ\"; Millingen, who\r\nwrote \"The Curiosities of Medical Practice,\" and \"The History of\r\nDuelling\"; Dr. Paris, whose \"Life of Sir Humphrey Davy,\"\r\nunsatisfactory as it is in many places, is still a useful book, and\r\nmany of whose other writings will long remain of great value; Wadd,\r\nthe humourous collector of \"Medical Ana\"; Dr. Merriman, the late\r\ncontributor to the _Gentleman's Magazine_ and _Notes and Queries_; and\r\nPettigrew, the biographer of Lettsom. If the physicians and surgeons\r\nstill living, who have openly or anonymously written with good effect\r\non subjects not immediately connected with their profession, were\r\nplaced before the reader, there would be found amongst them many of\r\nthe most distinguished of their fraternity.\r\n\r\n_Apropos_ of the Dr. Harrington mentioned above, a writer says--\"The\r\nDoctor for many years attended the Dowager Lady Trevor, relict of Lord\r\nTrevor, and last surviving daughter of Sir Richard Steele. He spoke of\r\nthis lady as possessing all the wit, humour, and gaiety of her father,\r\ntogether with most of his faults. She was extravagant, and always in\r\ndebt; but she was generous, charitable, and humane. She was\r\nparticularly partial to young people, whom she frequently entertained\r\nmost liberally, and delighted them with the pleasantry and volubility\r\nof her discourse. Her person was like that which her pleasant father\r\ndescribed himself in the _Spectator_, with his short face, &c. A\r\nlittle before her death (which was in the month of December) she sent\r\nfor her doctor, and, on his entering her chamber, he said, 'How fares\r\nyour Ladyship!' She replied, 'Oh, my dear Doctor, ill fare! I am\r\ngoing to break up before the holidays!' This agreeable lady lived many\r\nyears in Queen's Square, Bath, and, in the summer months, at St. Ann's\r\nHill, Surrey, the late residence of Rt. Hon. Chas. James Fox.\"\r\n\r\nWolcot, better known as Peter Pindar, was a medical practitioner, his\r\nfather and many of his ancestors having followed the same calling in\r\nDevonshire and Cornwall, under the names of Woolcot, Wolcott,\r\nWoolacot, Walcot, or Wolcot. After acquiring a knowledge of his\r\nprofession in a somewhat irregular manner Wolcot found a patron in Sir\r\nWilliam Trelawny, Bart., of Trelawny, co. Cornwall, who, on going out\r\nto assume the governorship of Jamaica, took the young surgeon with him\r\nto act as medical officer to his household. In Jamaica Wolcot figured\r\nin more characters than one. He was the governor's grand-master of the\r\nceremonies, private secretary, and chaplain. When the King of the\r\nMosquitoes waited on the new governor to express his loyal devotion to\r\nthe King of England's representative, Wolcot had to entertain the\r\nroyal guest--no difficult task as long as strong drink was in the way.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty--an enormously stout black brute--regarded intoxication as\r\nthe condition of life most fit for kings.\r\n\r\n    \"Champagne the courtier drinks, the spleen to chase,\r\n    The colonel Burgundy, and port his Grace.\"\r\n\r\nThe autocrat of the Mosquitoes, as the greatest only are, in his\r\nsimplicity sublime, was contented with rum or its equivalent.\r\n\r\n\"Mo' drink for king! Mo' drink for king!\" he would bellow, dancing\r\nround the grand-master of the governor's household.\r\n\r\n\"King,\" the grand-master would reply, \"you are drunk already.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no; king no drunk. Mo' drink for king! Broder George\" (_i. e._\r\nGeorge III.) \"love drink!\"\r\n\r\n_Grand-Master._--\"Broder George does not love drink: he is a sober\r\nman.\"\r\n\r\n_Autocrat._--\"But King of Musquito love drink. Me will have mo' drink.\r\nMe love drink like devil. Me drink whole ocean!\"\r\n\r\nThe different meagre memoirs of Peter Pindar are conflicting as to\r\nwhether he ever received ordination from the hands of the Bishop of\r\nLondon. It seems most probable that he never did. But, consecrated or\r\nnot, there is no doubt that he officiated as a colonial rector for\r\nsome time. Droll stories of him as a parish priest used to circulate\r\namongst his friends, as well as amongst his enemies. He read prayers\r\nand preached whenever a congregation appeared in his church, but three\r\nSundays out of every four not a soul came to receive the benefit of\r\nhis ministrations.\r\n\r\nThe rector was an admirable shot, and on his way from his house to\r\nchurch used to amuse himself with shooting pigeons, his clerk--also an\r\nexcellent shot--walking behind with a fowling-piece in his hand, and\r\ntaking part in the sport. Having reached the sacred edifice, his\r\nreverence and attendant opened the church door and waited in the porch\r\nten minutes for the advent of worshippers. If none had presented\r\nthemselves at the end of ten minutes, the pastor beat a retreat. If\r\nonly a few black Christians straggled up, the rector bought them off\r\nwith a few coins and then went home. One cunning old negro, who saw\r\nthat the parson's heart was more with the wild-fowl of the neighboring\r\nbay than bent on the discharge of his priestly functions, after a\r\nwhile presented himself every Sunday, when the following interview and\r\narrangement were regularly repeated:--\r\n\r\n\"What do you come here for, blackee?\" the parson would exclaim.\r\n\r\n\"Why, massa, to hear your good sermon and all de prayer ob de church.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would not a _bit_ or two do you more good?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, massa doctor--me lub prayer much, but me lub money too.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"bit or two\" would then be paid, and the devotee would retire\r\nspeedily from the scene. For an entire twelve-month was this\r\n_black_-mail exacted.\r\n\r\nOn his return to England, Wolcot, after a few unsuccessful attempts to\r\nestablish himself in practice, relinquished the profession of physic\r\nas well as that of divinity, and, settling himself in London, made\r\nboth fame and a good income by his writings. As a political satirist\r\nhe was in his day almost without a rival, and the popularity of his\r\nnumerous works would have placed a prudent man in lasting affluence.\r\nImprovidence, however, necessitated him to sell the copyright of his\r\nworks to Messrs. Robinson, Golding, and Walker for an annuity of £250,\r\npayable half-yearly, during the remainder of his life. Loose\r\nagreements have always been the fashion between authors and\r\npublishers, and in the present case it was not clearly stated what\r\n\"copyright of his works\" meant. The publishers interpreted it as the\r\ncopyright of both what the author had written at the time of making\r\nthe agreement, and also of what he should subsequently write. Wolcot,\r\nhowever, declared that he had in the transaction only had regard to\r\nhis prior productions. After some litigation and more squabbling, the\r\npublishers consented to take Wolcot's view of the case; but he never\r\nforgave them the discomfort they had caused him. His rancour against\r\n\"the trade\" increased with time, and inspired some of his most violent\r\nand unjust verses:--\r\n\r\n    \"Fired with the love of rhyme, and, let me say,\r\n    Or virtue, too, I sound the moral lay;\r\n    Much like St. Paul (who solemnly protests\r\n    He battled hard at Ephesus with beasts),\r\n    I've fought with lions, monkeys, bulls, and bears,\r\n    And got half Noah's ark about my ears;\r\n    Nay, more (which all the courts of justice know),\r\n    Fought with the brutes of Paternoster Row.\"\r\n\r\nFor medicine Peter Pindar had even less respect than Garth had. He\r\nused to say \"that he did not like the practice of it as an art. He was\r\nentirely ignorant, indeed, whether the patient was cured by the vis\r\n_medicatrix naturæ_, or the administration of a little pill, which was\r\neither directly or indirectly to reach the part affected.\" And for the\r\npractitioners of the art held in such low esteem, he cherished a\r\ncontempt that he would at times display with true Pindaric warmth. In\r\nhis two-act farce, \"Physic and Delusion; or Jezebel and the Doctors,\"\r\nthe dialogue is carried on in the following strain:--\r\n\r\n    \"_Blister._--    By God, old prig!\r\n    Another word, and by my wig----\r\n\r\n    \"_Bolus._--Thy wig? Great accoucheur, well said,\r\n    'Tis of more value than thy head;\r\n    And 'mongst thy customers--poor ninnies!\r\n    Has helped thee much to bag thy guineas.\"\r\n\r\nAmongst Peter Pindar's good services to the world was the protection\r\nhe afforded to Opie (or Oppy, as it was at one time less euphoniously\r\nspelt and pronounced) the artist, when he was a poor country clown,\r\nrising at three o'clock in the summer mornings, to pursue his art with\r\nrude pieces of chalk and charcoal. Wolcot presented the boy with his\r\nfirst pencils, colours, and canvas, and put him in the way to paint\r\nportraits for the magnificent remuneration of half-a-guinea, and\r\nsubsequently a guinea a-head. And it was to the same judicious friend\r\nthat Opie, on leaving the provinces, owed his first success in London.\r\n\r\nWolcot used to tell some droll stories about his artist friend. Opie's\r\nindiscreet manner was a source of continual trouble to those who\r\nendeavoured to serve him; for, priding himself on being \"a rough\r\ndiamond,\" he took every pains that no one should fail to see the\r\nroughness. A lady sitter was anxious that her portrait should be \"very\r\nhandsome,\" and frankly told the painter so. \"Then, madam,\" was the\r\nreply, \"you wish to be painted otherwise than you are. I see you do\r\nnot want your own face.\" Not less impudent was he at the close of his\r\nfirst year in London, in taking out writs against several sitters who\r\nwere rather tardy in their payments.\r\n\r\nOpie was not the only artist of celebrity deeply indebted to Peter\r\nPindar. Bone, the painter in enamel, found an efficient friend in the\r\nsame discerning lover of the arts. In this respect Wolcot was worthy\r\nof the profession which he deserted, and affected to despise; and his\r\nname will ever be honourably mentioned amongst those physicians who\r\nhave fostered art, from the days of picture-loving Mead, down to those\r\nof the writer's very kind friend, Dr. Diamond, who gathered from\r\nremote quarters \"The Diamond Collection of Portraits,\" which may be\r\nseen amongst the art treasures of Oxford.\r\n\r\nOne of the worthies of Dr. Diamond's family was Robertus Fludd, or De\r\nFluctibus, the writer of Rosicrucian celebrity who gave Sterne more\r\nthan one lesson in the arts of eccentricity. Sir Thomas Fludd of\r\nMilgate, Bearsted, co. Kent (grandson of David Fludd, _alias_ Lloyd of\r\nMorton, in Shropshire), had five sons and a daughter. Of this\r\noffspring, one son, Thomas, purchased Gore Court, and fixed there a\r\nfamily, the vicissitudes of which may be learnt by a reference to\r\nHasted's Kent. From this branch of the Fludds descended Dr. Diamond,\r\nwho, amongst other curious family relics, possesses the diploma of\r\nRobertus de Fluctibus.\r\n\r\nWhen Robertus de Fluctibus died, Sept. 8, 1637, in Coleman St.,\r\nLondon, his body, under the protection of a herald of arms, was\r\nconveyed to the family seat in Kent, and was then buried in Bearsted\r\nChurch, under a stone which he had before laid for himself. The\r\nmonument over his ashes was ordered by him in his last will to be made\r\nafter that of William Camden in the Abbey at Westminster. The\r\ninscription which marks his resting-place declares his, rather than\r\nour, estimate of his intellectual greatness;\r\n\r\n    Magnificus non hæc sub odoribus urna vaporat,\r\n    Crypta tegit cineres nec speciosa tuos.\r\n    Quod mortale minus, tibi te committimus unum;\r\n    Ingenii vivent hic monumenta tui\r\n    Nam tibi qui similis scribit, moriturque, sepulchrum\r\n    Pro totâ æternum posteritate facit.\r\n\r\nMore modest, and at the same time more humorous, is the epitaph, in\r\nHendon Church, of poor Thomas Crossfield, whose name, alike as surgeon\r\nand politician, has passed from among men:--\r\n\r\n    \"Underneath Tom Crossfield lies,\r\n    Who cares not now who laughs or cries.\r\n    He always laughed, and when mellow\r\n    Was a harum scarum sort of fellow.\r\n    To none gave designed offence,\r\n    So--_Honi soit qui mal y pense_.\"\r\n\r\nAmongst the medical poets there is one whom all scholarly physicians\r\njealously claim as of their body--John Keats; he who, dying at Rome,\r\nat the age of twenty-six, wished his epitaph to be, \"Here lies one\r\nwhose name was writ in water.\" After serving his apprenticeship under\r\nan Edmonton surgeon, the author of \"Endymion\" became a medical student\r\nat St. Thomas's hospital.\r\n\r\nMention here, too, may be made of Dr. Macnish, the author of \"The\r\nAnatomy of Drunkenness,\" and \"The Modern Pythagorean\"; and of Dr.\r\nMoir, the poet, whose death, a few years since, robbed the world of a\r\nsimple and pathetic writer, and his personal acquaintance of a\r\nnoble-hearted friend.\r\n\r\nBut of all modern English poets who have had an intimate personal\r\nconnection with the medical profession, the greatest by far is\r\nCrabbe--\r\n\r\n         \"Nature's sternest painter, yet the best.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1754 George Crabbe was born in the old sea-faring town of\r\nAldborough, in the county of Suffolk. His father, the collector of\r\nsalt-duties, or salt-master of the town, was a churlish sullen fellow\r\nat the best of times; but, falling upon adversity in his old days, he\r\nbecame the _beau-ideal_ of a domestic tyrant. He was not, however,\r\nwithout his respectable points. Though a poor man, he did his best to\r\neducate his children above the ranks of the very poor. One of them\r\nbecame a thriving glazier in his native town; another went to sea, and\r\nbecame captain of a Liverpool slave-ship; and a third, also a sailor,\r\nmet with strange vicissitudes--at one time enjoying a very\r\nconsiderable amount of prosperity, and then suffering penury and\r\npersecution. A studious and a delicate lad, George, the eldest of the\r\nparty, was designed for some pursuit more adapted to his disposition\r\nand physical powers than the avocations of working mechanics, or the\r\nhard duties of the marine service. When quite a child, he had, amongst\r\nthe inhabitants of Aldborough, a reputation for mental superiority\r\nthat often did him good service. On one occasion he chanced to offend\r\na playmate--his senior and \"master,\" as boys and savages term it--and\r\nwas on the point of receiving a good thrashing nigh the roaring waves\r\nof old ocean, when a third boy, a common acquaintance, exclaimed in a\r\nvoice of affright:--\r\n\r\n\"Yar marn't middle a' him; lit him aloone--he ha' got l'arning.\"\r\n\r\nThe plea was admitted as a good one, and the future bard, taking his\r\nbenefit of clergy, escaped the profanation of a drubbing.\r\n\r\nGeorge was sent to two respectable schools, the one at Bungay, in\r\nSuffolk, and the other (the better of the two) at Stowmarket, in the\r\nsame county. The expense of such an education, even if it amounted to\r\nno more than £20 per annum, was no small undertaking for the\r\nsalt-master of a fishing-village; for Aldborough--now a handsome and\r\nmuch frequented provincial watering-place--was in 1750 nothing better\r\nthan a collection of huts, whose humble inhabitants possessed little\r\nstake in the commonweal beyond the right of sending to parliament two\r\nmembers to represent their interests and opinions. On leaving school,\r\nin his fourteenth year, George was apprenticed to a country doctor of\r\na very rough sort, who plied his trade at Wickham Brook, a small\r\nvillage near Bury St. Edmunds. It is a fact worthy of note, as\r\nthrowing some light on the state of the profession in the provinces,\r\nthat the apprentice shared the bed of his master's stable-boy. At\r\nWickham Brook, however, the lad did not remain long to endure such\r\nindignity. He was removed from that scene of trial, and placed under\r\nthe tutelage of Mr. Page, a surgeon of Woodbridge, a gentleman of good\r\nconnections and polite tastes, and through the marriage of his\r\ndaughter with the late famous Alderman Wood, an ancestor of a learned\r\njudge, who is not more eminent as a lawyer than beloved as a man.\r\n\r\nIt was during his apprenticeship to Mr. Page of Woodbridge that Crabbe\r\nmade his first important efforts in poetry, publishing, in the year\r\n1772, some fugitive pieces in _Wheble's Magazine_, and in 1775\r\n\"Inebriety, a poem, in three parts. Ipswich: printed and sold by C.\r\nPunchard, bookseller, in the Butter-market.\" While at Woodbridge, too,\r\nhis friend Levett, a young surgeon of the neighborhood, took him over\r\nto Framlingham, introducing him to the families of that picturesque\r\nold town. William Springall Levett was at that time engaged to Alethea\r\nBrereton, a lady who, under the _nom de plume_ of \"Eugenia Acton,\"\r\nwrote certain novels that created a sensation in their brief day.\r\nAmongst them were \"Vicissitudes of Genteel Life,\" \"The Microcosm,\"\r\nand \"A Tale without a Title.\" The love-making of Mr. Levett and Miss\r\nEugenia de Acton was put a stop to by the death of the former, in\r\n1774. The following epitaph, transcribed from the History of\r\nFramlingham, the work of the able antiquarian, Mr. Richard Green, is\r\ninteresting as one of Crabbe's earlier compositions.\r\n\r\n    \"What! though no trophies peer above his dust,\r\n    Nor sculptured conquests deck his sober bust;\r\n    What! though no earthly thunders sound his name,\r\n    Death gives him conquest, and our sorrows fame!\r\n    One sigh reflection heaves, but shuns excess,\r\n    More should we mourn him, did we love him less.\"\r\n\r\nSubsequently Miss Brereton married a gentleman named Lewis, engaged in\r\nextensive agricultural operations. However brief her literary\r\nreputation may have been, her pen did her good service; for, at a\r\ncritical period of her husband's career, it brought her sums of\r\nmuch-needed money.\r\n\r\nMr. Levett's romance closed prematurely together with his life, but\r\nthrough him Crabbe first became acquainted with the lovely girl whom\r\nhe loved through years of trial, and eventually made his wife. Sarah\r\nElmy was the niece of John Tovell, _yeoman_, not _gentleman_--he would\r\nhave scorned the title. Not that the worthy man was without pride of\r\ndivers kinds, or that he did not hold himself to be a gentleman. He\r\nbelieved in the Tovells as being one of the most distinguished\r\nfamilies of the country. A Tovell, by mere right of being a Tovell,\r\ncould thrash more Frenchmen than any Englishman, not a Tovell, could.\r\nWhen the good man said, \"I am nothing more than a plain yeoman,\" he\r\nnever intended or expected any one to believe him, or to regard his\r\nwords in any other light than as a playful protest against being\r\ndeemed \"a plain yeoman,\" or that modern hybrid, \"a gentleman farmer.\"\r\n\r\nHe was a well-made, handsome, pleasant fellow--riding a good horse\r\nwith the hounds--loving good cheer--enjoying laughter, without being\r\nvery particular as to the cause of it--a little too much addicted to\r\ncarousing, but withal an agreeable and useful citizen; and he lived at\r\nParham Lodge, a house that a peer inhabited after him, without making\r\nany important alterations in the place.\r\n\r\nOn Crabbe's first introduction to Parham Lodge he was received with\r\ncordiality; but when it was seen that he had fallen in love with the\r\nsquire's niece, it was only natural that \"his presumption\" should not\r\nat first meet the approval either of Mrs. Tovell or her husband. But\r\nthe young people plighted troth to each other, and the engagement was\r\nrecognized by the lady's family. It was years, however, before the\r\nwedding bells were set ringing. Crabbe's apprenticeship to Mr. Page\r\nfinished, he tried ineffectually to raise the funds for a regular\r\ncourse of hospital instruction in London. Returning to Aldborough, he\r\nfurnished a shop with a few bottles and a pound's worth of drugs, and\r\nset up as \"an apothecary.\" Of course it was only amongst the poor of\r\nhis native town that he obtained patients, the wealthier inhabitants\r\nof the borough distrusting the knowledge of a doctor who had not\r\nwalked the hospitals. In the summer of 1778, however, he was appointed\r\nsurgeon to the Warwickshire militia, then stationed at Aldborough, and\r\nin the following winter, on the Warwickshire militia being moved and\r\nreplaced by the Norfolk militia, he was appointed surgeon to the\r\nlatter regiment also. But these posts were only temporary, and\r\nconferred but little emolument on their holder. At length poverty\r\ndrove the poet from his native town. The rest of his career is matter\r\nof notoriety. Every reader knows how the young man went to London and\r\nonly escaped the death of Otway or Chatterton by the generous\r\npatronage of Burke, how through Burke's assistance he was ordained,\r\nbecame the Duke of Rutland's chaplain, obtained comfortable church\r\npreferment, and for a long span enjoyed an amount of domestic\r\nhappiness that was as great and richly deserved as his literary\r\nreputation.\r\n\r\nCrabbe's marriage with Sarah Elmy eventually conferred on him and his\r\nchildren the possession of Parham Lodge, which estate, a few years\r\nsince, passed from them into the hands of wealthy purchasers. The poet\r\nalso succeeded to other wealth through the same connection, an\r\nold-maid sister of John Tovell leaving him a considerable sum of\r\nmoney. \"I can screw Crabbe up and down like an old fiddle,\" this\r\namiable lady was fond of saying; and during her life she proved that\r\nher boast was no empty one. But her will was a handsome apology for\r\nall her little tiffs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nNUMBER ELEVEN--A HOSPITAL STORY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Then, sir,\" said Mrs. Mallet, \"if you'll only not look so frightened,\r\nI'll tell you how it was. It is now twenty years ago that I was very\r\nunfortunate. I was not more than thirty years of age, but I was old\r\nenough to have just lost a good husband and a dear little babe; and\r\nthen, when I hadn't a sixpence in my pocket, I caught the fever, and\r\nhad to go to a hospital. I wasn't used to trouble; for although I was\r\nnothing better than a poor man's child, I had known all my life\r\nnothing but kindness. I never had but one mistress,--my lady, who when\r\nshe was the most beautiful young lady in all Devonshire, took me out\r\nof a village school, and raised me to be her maid; and her maid I was\r\nfor twelve years--first down in Devonshire, and afterwards up in\r\nLondon, when she married (somewhat against the will of her family) a\r\nthorough good gentleman, but a poor one, who after a time took her out\r\nto India, where he became a judge, and she a grand lady. My dear\r\nmistress would have taken me out to India with her, only she was then\r\ntoo poor to pay for my passage out, and bear the expense of me there,\r\nwhere labour can be got so cheap, and native servants can live on a\r\nhandful of rice a day. She, sir, is Lady Burridge--the same who gave\r\nme the money to start in this house with, and whose carriage you saw\r\nyesterday at my door.\r\n\r\n\"So my mistress went eastward, and I was left behind to marry a young\r\nman I had loved for some few years, and who had served during that\r\ntime as clerk to my lady's husband. I was a young woman, and young\r\nwomen, to the end of the chapter, will think it a brave thing to fall\r\nin love. I thought my sweetheart was a handsomer and cleverer man than\r\nany other of his station in all London. I wonder how many girls have\r\nthought the same of their favourites! I went to church one morning\r\nwith a fluttering heart and trembling knees, and came out under the\r\nporch thinking that all my life would ever afterwards be brighter, and\r\nlighter, and sunnier than it had been before. Well! in dancing into\r\nthat pretty blunder, I wasn't a bigger fool than lots of others.\r\n\r\n\"And if a good husband is a great blessing (and she must be a paltry\r\nwoman who can say nay to that), I was born to luck; for my husband was\r\nkind, good, and true--his temper was as sweet at home as his manners\r\nwere abroad--he was hard-working and clever, sober and devout;\r\nand--though you may laugh at a woman of my age talking so like a\r\nromance--I tell you, sir, that if my life had to come all over again,\r\nI'd rather have the mischance of marrying my dear Richard, that the\r\ngood fortune of wedding a luckier man.\r\n\r\n\"There's no doubt the game turned out ill for me. At first it seemed\r\nas if it would be just otherwise, for my husband had good health,\r\nplenty of work, and sufficient pay; so that, when my little girl came,\r\nher sweet face brought no shadow of anxiety with it, and we hoped she\r\nwould be followed in due course by half-a-dozen more. But ere the dear\r\nbabe had learned to prattle, a drear change came over the happy\r\nprospect. The fever crept over the gentle darling, and after she had\r\nsuffered for a week or more, lying on my arms, God raised her from me\r\ninto his happy home, where the beauty of summer reigns for ever, and\r\nthe coldness of winter never enters. Richard and I took the body of\r\nour babe to the burial-ground, and saw it covered up in the earth\r\nwhich by turns gives all we get, and takes away from us all we have;\r\nand as we walked back to our deserted home, arm-in-arm, in the light\r\nof the summer's evening, we talked to each other more solemnly and\r\ntenderly than we had done for many a day. And the next morning he went\r\nback to his work in the office, from which he had absented himself\r\nsince our child's death; and I encouraged him to cheer up, and not to\r\ngive way to sorrow when I was not nigh to comfort him, but toil\r\nbravely and hopefully, as a man should; and in so advising him, I do\r\nnot blush to say that I thought not only of what was best for his\r\nspirits, but also of what our necessity required--for we were only\r\npoor people, not at any time beforehand in the world, and now reduced\r\nby the cost of our little one's illness and funeral; and, sir, in this\r\nhard world we women, most times, have the best of it, for when the\r\nhouse is full of sorrow, we have little else to do but weep, but the\r\nmen have to grieve and toil too.\r\n\r\n\"But poor Richard could not hold up his head. He came back from work\r\nthat day pale and faint, and in the evening he had a chill and a\r\nheat-fit, that let me know the fever which had killed our little one\r\nhad passed into him. The next day he could not leave his bed, and the\r\ndoctor (a most kind man, who was always making rough jokes in a rough\r\nvoice--just to hide his womanliness) said to me, 'If your husband goes\r\ndown to his master's chambers in the Temple to-day, he had better stop\r\nat the coffin-maker's, in the corner of Chancery Lane, and leave his\r\nmeasure.' But Richard's case was not one for a jest, and he rapidly\r\nbecame worse than the doctor fancied he would be when he made that\r\nlight speech. He was ill for six weeks, and then began slowly to mend;\r\nhe got on so far as to sit up for two days for half-an-hour while he\r\nhad his tea, and we were hoping that soon he would be able to be moved\r\ninto the country--to my sister's, whose husband was an engineer at\r\nStratford; but, suddenly, he had a relapse, and on the morning that\r\nfinished the tenth week from his being seized, his arms let go their\r\nhold on my neck--and I was left alone!\r\n\r\n\"All during my babe's and Richard's long illness my sister Martha had\r\nbehaved like a true sister to me. She was my only sister, and, to the\r\nbest of my knowledge, the only relation I had in the world--and a good\r\none she was; from girl to woman her heart always rung out clear like a\r\nbell. She had three young children, but even fear of contagion\r\nreaching them could not keep her from me in my trouble. She kept\r\nmaking the journey backwards and forwards, at least once a week, in\r\nthe carrier's cart; and, though she had no money to spare, she\r\nbrought me, with her husband's blessing, presents of wine, and\r\njellies, and delicate meat, to buy which, I knew right well, she and\r\nher husband and her children must have pinched themselves down to\r\nscanty rations of bread and water. Her hands helped mine to put the\r\nflowers in poor Richard's coffin; she bore me up while I followed it,\r\npale and trembling, to the grave; and when that horrible day was\r\ncoming to an end, and she was about to return home, she took me into\r\nher arms, and covering me with kisses and caressings, and a thousand\r\ngentle sayings, as if I had been a child of her own, instead of her\r\nsister and a grown woman, she made me promise to come down to her at\r\nStratford at the end of the week, and stay with her till God should\r\ngive me strength and spirits and guidance, to work for myself again.\r\n\r\n\"But that promise was not kept. Next morning the rough-tender doctor\r\ncame in, out of his mere goodness, to give me a friendly look, and a\r\n'God speed you,' and found me, too, sickening for an illness. I knew,\r\nsir, he had made the discovery before his lips confessed a word; for\r\nwhen he had taken my wrist and felt my pulse, and looked up into my\r\nworn face, he turned pale, as if almost frightened, and such a look of\r\ngrief came on his eyes and lips that he could not have said plainer,\r\n'My poor woman! my poor woman! what I feared from the beginning, and\r\nprayed God not to permit, has come to pass at last.'\r\n\r\n\"Then I fairly broke down and cried bitterly; and I told the doctor\r\nhow sore afflicted I was--how God had taken my husband and babe from\r\nme--how all my little means had been consumed in the expenses of\r\nnursing--how the little furniture in my rooms would not pay half what\r\nI owed to honest folk--and how, even in my unspeakable wretchedness, I\r\ncould not ask the Almighty to take away my life, for I could not rest\r\nin death if I left the world without paying my just debts. Well, sir,\r\nthe doctor sate down by me, and said, in his softest and simplest\r\nway:--\r\n\r\n\"'Come, come, neighbour, don't you frighten yourself. Be calm, and\r\nlisten to me. Don't let the thought of debts worry you. What little I\r\nhave done in the way of business for your poor child and husband I\r\nnever wish to be paid for--so there's your greatest creditor disposed\r\nof. As for the others, they won't trouble you, for I'll undertake to\r\nsee that none of them shall think that you have wronged 'em. I wish I\r\ncould do more, neighbor; but I ain't a rich man, and I have got a wife\r\nand a regiment of little ones at home, who won't help, in the long\r\nrun, to make me richer--although I am sure they'll make me happier.\r\nBut now for yourself; you must go to the fever-hospital, to have your\r\nillness out; the physician who'll take care of you there is the\r\ncleverest in all London; and, as he is an old friend of mine, I can\r\nask him to pay especial attention to you. You'll find it a pleasant,\r\ncheerful place, much more cool and comfortable than your rooms here;\r\nthe nurses are all of them good people; and while lying on your bed\r\nthere you won't have to fret yourself with thinking how you are to pay\r\nfor the doctors, and medicine, and kitchen physic.'\r\n\r\n\"I was only too thankful to assent to all the doctor said; and\r\nforthwith he fetched a coach, put me into it, and took me off to the\r\nfever-hospital, to which his influence procured me instant\r\nadmittance. Without delay I was conveyed to a large and comfortable\r\nbed, which, with another similar bed parallel to it, was placed\r\nagainst the wall at the end of a long gallery, containing twenty other\r\nbeds. The first day of my hospital life I spent tranquilly enough; the\r\nlanguor of extreme exhaustion had soothed me, and my malady had not\r\nrobbed me of my senses. So I lay calmly on my couch and watched all\r\nthe proceedings and arrangements of the great bed-room. I noticed how\r\nclean and white all the beds looked, and what kindly women the nurses\r\nwere; I remarked what a wide space there was down the middle of the\r\nroom between the two rows of beds, and again what large intervals\r\nthere were between the beds on each side; I observed, too, that over\r\nevery bed there was a ventilator set in the wall, and beneath the\r\nventilator a board, on which was pinned a paper, bearing, in a\r\nfilled-up printed form, the number of the bed to which it belonged,\r\nthe date when the occupant was admitted to the ward, the names of the\r\nphysician and nurse under whose charge she was, the medicine she was\r\ntaking, and the diet on which she was put. It made me smile, moreover,\r\nto note how the nurses, when giving physic or nourishment, or\r\notherwise attending to their charges, would frequently address them by\r\nthe numbers on their boards, instead of their names.\r\n\r\n\"'Nurse, dear,' I asked, with a smile, when my attendant came near me,\r\n'what's my name?'\r\n\r\n\"'Oh, dear!' said she, looking up at the board which had already been\r\nfixed over my head, 'your name is Number Eleven.'\r\n\r\n\"It would be hard for me to give you, sir, any notion of how these\r\nwords, _Number Eleven_, took possession of my mind. This was the more\r\nstrange, because the nurse did not usually call me by them; for she\r\nwas a motherly creature, and almost always addressed me as 'poor\r\ndear,' or 'poor child'; and the doctors who had the charge of me spoke\r\nto me as 'friend,' or 'old friend,' or 'neighbor.' But all the same\r\nfor that, I always thought of myself as Number Eleven; and ere many\r\ndays, if any one had asked me what my name was, I could not for the\r\nlife of me have remembered Abigail Mallet, but should have answered\r\nNumber Eleven. The patient in the next bed to me was Number\r\nTwenty-two; she was, like myself, a poor woman who had just lost a\r\nhusband and child by the fever, and both of us were much struck, and\r\nthen drawn to each other, by discovering how we had suffered alike. We\r\noften interchanged a few words during the sorrowful hours of the long,\r\nhot nights, but our whisperings always turned on the same subject.\r\n'Number Eleven,' I used to hear her poor thin lips murmur, 'are you\r\nthinking of your baby, dear?' 'To be sure, darling,' I would answer;\r\n'I am awake, and when I am awake, I am always thinking of her.' Then\r\nmost times she would inquire, 'Number Eleven, dear, which do you think\r\nof most--the little one or her father?' Whereto I would reply, 'I\r\nthink of both alike, dear, for whenever I look at her, a fair young\r\nangel in heaven--she seems to be lying in her father's arms.' And\r\nafter we had conversed so, No. 22 would be quiet for a few minutes;\r\nand often, in the silence of the night, I could at such times hear\r\nthat which informed me the poor woman was weeping to herself--in such\r\na way that she was happier for her tears.\r\n\r\n\"But my malady progressed unfavourably. Each succeeding night was\r\nworse to endure; and the morning light, instead of bringing\r\nrefreshment and hope, only gave to me a dull, gloomy consciousness\r\nthat I had passed hours in delirium, and that I was weaker and heavier\r\nin heart, and more unlikely than ever to hold my head up again. They\r\ncut all the hair off my head, and put blisters at the back of my neck;\r\nbut the awful weight of sorrow and the gnawing heat kept on my brain\r\nall the same. I could no longer amuse myself with looking at what went\r\non in the ward; I lost all care for the poor woman who lay in the next\r\nbed; and soon I tossed to and fro, and heeded nothing of the outer\r\nworld except the burning, and aching, and thirst, and sleeplessness\r\nthat encased me.\r\n\r\n\"One morning I opened my eyes and saw the doctor standing between me\r\nand No. 22, talking to the nurse. A fit of clearness passed over my\r\nunderstanding, such as people suffering under fever often experience\r\nfor a few seconds, and I heard the physician say softly to the nurses,\r\n'We must be careful and do our best, sister, and leave the rest to\r\nGod. They are both very ill; this is now the fourth day since either\r\nof them recognized me. They must have more wine and brandy to help\r\nthem through. Here, give me their boards.' On this, the nurse took\r\ndown the boards, and handed them, one after the other, to the\r\nphysician, and he, taking a pen from a clerk, who always attended him,\r\nwrote his directions on the papers, and handed them back to the nurse.\r\nHaving heard and seen all this, I shifted in my bed, and after a few\r\nweak efforts to ponder on my terrible condition, and how awful a thing\r\nit is to die, I fell back into my former state of delirium and\r\nhalf-consciousness.\r\n\r\n\"The next distinct memory I have of my illness was when I opened my\r\neyes and beheld a wooden screen standing between me and the next bed.\r\nMy head felt as if it had been put into a closely fitting cap of ice;\r\nbut apart from this strange sensation, I was free from pain. My body\r\nwas easy, and my mind was tranquil. My nurse was standing at the foot\r\nof my bed, looking towards me with an expression of solemn tenderness;\r\nand by her side was another woman--as I afterwards found out, a new\r\nnurse, unaccustomed to the ways of the hospital.\r\n\r\n\"'What is that screen there for?' asked the novice.\r\n\r\n\"My nurse lowered her voice, and answered slowly, 'Number Eleven, poor\r\nsoul, is dying; she'll be dead in half an hour; and the screen is\r\nthere so that Number Twenty-Two mayn't see her.'\r\n\r\n\"'Poor soul!' said the novice, 'may God have mercy upon her!'\r\n\r\n\"They spoke scarcely above a whisper, but I heard them distinctly; and\r\na solemn gladness, such as I used to feel, when I was a young girl, at\r\nthe sound of church music, came over me at learning that I was to die.\r\nOnly half an hour, and I should be with baby and Richard in heaven!\r\nMixed with this thought, too, there was a pleasant memory of those I\r\nhad loved and who had loved me--of sister Martha and her husband and\r\nchildren, of the doctor who had been so good to me and brought me to\r\nthe hospital, of my lady in India, of many others; and I silently\r\nprayed the Almighty with my dying heart to protect and bless them.\r\nThen passed through me a fluttering of strange, soft fancies, and it\r\nwas revealed to me that I was dead.\r\n\r\n\"By-and-by the physician came his round of the ward, stepping lightly,\r\npausing at each bed, speaking softly to nurses and patients, and,\r\nwithout knowing it, making many a poor woman entertain kinder thoughts\r\nthan she had ever meant to cherish of the wealthy and gentle. When he\r\ncame to the end of the ward, his handsome face wore a pitiful air, and\r\nit was more by the movement of his lips than by the sound of his mouth\r\nthat I knew what passed from him to the nurse.\r\n\r\n\"'Well, sister, well,' he said, 'she sleeps quietly at last. Poor\r\nthing! I hope and believe the next life will be a fairer one for her\r\nthan this has been.'\r\n\r\n\"'Her sister has been written to,' observed the nurse.\r\n\r\n\"'Quite right; and how is the other?'\r\n\r\n\"'Oh, No. 22 is just the same--quite still, not moving at all,\r\nscarcely breathing, sir!'\r\n\r\n\"'Um!--you must persevere. Possibly she'll pull through. Good-bye,\r\nsister.'\r\n\r\n\"Late in the evening my sister Martha came. She was dressed in black,\r\nand led with her hand Rhoda, her eldest daughter. Poor Martha was very\r\npale, and worn, and ill; when she approached the bed on which I lay,\r\nshe seemed as if she would faint, and she trembled so painfully that\r\nmy kind nurse led her behind the screen, so that she might recover\r\nherself out of my sight. After a few seconds--say two minutes--she\r\nstood again at the foot of my bed--calmer, but with tears in her eyes,\r\nand such a mournful loveliness in her sweet face as I had never seen\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\"'I shouldn't have known her, nurse,' she said, gazing at me for a\r\nshort space and then withdrawing her eyes--'she is so much altered.'\r\n\r\n\"'Ah, dear!' answered the nurse, 'sickness alters people much--and\r\ndeath more.'\r\n\r\n\"'I know it, nurse--I know it. And she looks very calm and\r\nblissful--her face is so full of rest--so full of rest!'\r\n\r\n\"The nurse fetched some seats, and made Martha and Rhoda sit down side\r\nby side; and then the good woman stood by them, ready to afford them\r\nall comfort in her power.\r\n\r\n\"'How did she bear her illness?' inquired Martha.\r\n\r\n\"'Like an angel, dear,' answered the nurse. 'She had a sweet,\r\ngrateful, loving temper. Whatever I did for her, even though my duty\r\ncompelled me to give her pain, she was never fretful, but always\r\nconcealed her anguish and said, \"Thank you, dear, thank you, you are\r\nvery good; God will reward you for all your goodness\"; and as the end\r\ncame nigher I often fancied that she had reasonable and happy moments,\r\nfor she would fold her hands together, and say scraps of prayers which\r\nchildren are taught.'\r\n\r\n\"'Nurse,' replied my sister after a pause, 'she and I were the only\r\nchildren of our father, and we were left orphans very young. She was\r\ntwo years older than I, and she always thought for me and did for me\r\nas if she had been my mother. I could fill whole hours with telling\r\nyou all the goodness and forbearance and love she displayed to me,\r\nfrom the time I was little or no bigger than my child here. I was\r\noften wayward and peevish, and gave her many hours of trouble, but\r\nthough at times she could be hot to others she never spoke an unkind\r\nword to me. There was no sacrifice that she would not have made for\r\nme; but all the return I ever made was to worry her with my evil\r\njealous temper. I was continually imagining unchristian things against\r\nher: that she slighted me; that, because she had a mistress who made\r\nmuch of her, she didn't care for me; that she didn't think my children\r\nfit to be proud of. And I couldn't keep all these foolish thoughts in\r\nmy head to myself, but I must needs go and speak them out to her, and\r\nirritate her to quarrel with me. But she always returned smooth words\r\nto my angry ones, and I had never a fit of my unjust temper but she\r\ncharmed me out of it, and showed me my error in such a way that I was\r\nreproved, without too much humiliation, and loved her more than ever.\r\nOh! dear friend, dear good nurse, if you have a sister, don't treat\r\nher, as I did Abigail, with suspicion and wicked passion; for should\r\nyou, all the light speeches of your frowardness will return to you,\r\nand lie heavy on your heart when hers shall beat no more.'\r\n\r\n\"When Martha had said this she cried very bitterly; and as I lay dead\r\non my bed, and listened to her unfair self-reproaches, I longed to\r\nbreak the icy bonds that held me, and yearned to clasp her to my\r\nbreast. Still, though I could neither move nor utter a sound, it\r\nthrilled me with gladness to see how she loved me.\r\n\r\n\"'Mother,' said little Rhoda, softly, 'don't cry. We shan't be long\r\naway from Aunt and her baby, for when this life is done we shall go\r\nto them. You know, mother, you told me so last night.'\r\n\r\n\"It was not permitted to me to hear any more. A colder chill came over\r\nmy brain--and, wrapt in unconsciousness and deep stillness, I lay upon\r\nmy bed.\r\n\r\n\"My next recollection is of beholding the gray dawn stream in through\r\nthe half-opened windows, and of wondering, amid vague reminiscences of\r\nmy previous sensations, how it was that a dead person could take\r\nnotice of the world it moved in when alive. It is not enough to say\r\nthat my experience of the last repose was pleasant to me; I was\r\nrejoiced and greatly delighted by it. Death, it seemed then, was no\r\nstate of cold decay for men to shudder at with affright--but a\r\ncondition of tranquility and mental comfort. I continued to muse on\r\nthis remarkable discovery for an hour and more, when my favourite\r\nnurse reappeared to relieve the woman who had taken the night-watch,\r\nand approached me.\r\n\r\n\"'Ah!' she surprised me by saying, as a smile of congratulation\r\nlighted her face, 'then you are alive this morning, dear, and have\r\nyour handsome eyes wide open.'\r\n\r\n\"This in my opinion was a singularly strange and inappropriate\r\naddress; but I made no attempt to respond to it, for I knew that I was\r\ndead. and that the dead do not speak.\r\n\r\n\"'Why, dear heart,' resumed the nurse, kneeling by my side and kissing\r\nme, 'can't you find your tongue? I know by your eyes that you know me;\r\nthe glassy stare has left them. Come, do say a word, and say you are\r\nbetter.'\r\n\r\n\"Then a suspicion flashed across my brain, and raising my right hand\r\nslightly, I pointed to the bed of No. 22, and asked, 'How is she?--how\r\nis she?'\r\n\r\n\"'Don't frighten yourself, dear,' answered the nurse, 'she isn't\r\nthere. She has been moved. She doesn't have that bed my longer!'\r\n\r\n\"'Then it is _she_ who is dead, nurse; and all the rest was a dream?\r\nIt is she who is dead?'\r\n\r\n\"'Hush, hush, dear! she has gone to rest--'\r\n\r\n\"Yes! it was all clear to me. Not I but my unfortunate companion had\r\ndied; and in my delirious fancy I had regarded the friends who came to\r\nsee her, and convey her to the grave, as my sister Martha and her\r\nlittle daughter Rhoda. I did not impart to the nurse the delusion of\r\nwhich I had been the victim; for, as is often the case with the sick,\r\nI was sensitive with regard to the extreme mental sickness into which\r\nI had fallen, and the vagaries of my reason. So I kept my secret to\r\nthe best of my power; and having recognised how much better I was, how\r\nthe fever had quitted my veins and the weight had left my head, I\r\nthanked God in my heart for all his mercies, and once more cherished a\r\nhope that he might see fit to restore me to health.\r\n\r\n\"My recovery was rapid. At the end of a fortnight I was moved into the\r\nconvalescents' ward, and was fed up with wine and meat in abundance. I\r\nhad every reason to be thankful for all the kindness bestowed on me in\r\nthe hospital, and all the good effect God permitted that kindness to\r\nhave. But one thing troubled me very much and cut me to the quick.\r\nEver since I had been in the hospital my sister had neither been to\r\nsee me, nor sent to inquire after me. It was no very difficult\r\nbusiness to account for her neglect of me. She had her good qualities\r\n(even in the height of my anger I could not deny that), but she was of\r\na very proud high temper. She could sacrifice anything but her pride\r\nfor love of me. I had gone into an hospital, had received public\r\ncharity, and she hadn't courage to acknowledge a sister who had sunk\r\nso low as that! But if she was proud so was I; I could be as high and\r\nhaughty as she; and, what was more, I would show her that I could be\r\nso! What, to leave her own sister--her only sister--who had worked for\r\nher when she was little, and who had loved her as her own heart! I\r\nwould resent it! Perhaps fortune might yet have a turn to make in my\r\nfavour; and if so I would in my prosperity remember how I had been\r\ntreated in my adversity. I am filled with shame now, when I think on\r\nthe revengeful imaginations which followed each other through my\r\nbreast. I am thankful that when my animosity was at its height my\r\nsister did not present herself before me; for had she done so, I fear\r\nthat, without waiting for an explanation from her, I should have\r\nspoken hasty words that (however much I might have afterwards repented\r\nthem, and she forgiven them) would have rendered it impossible for us\r\nto be again the same as we were before. I never mentioned to any\r\none--nurse or patient--in the convalescent ward, the secret of my\r\nclouded brows, or let out that I had a friend in the world to think of\r\nme or to neglect me. Hour after hour I listened to women and girls and\r\nyoung children, talking of home pleasures and longing to be quite\r\nwell, and dismissed from the confinement of the hospital, and\r\nanticipating the pleasure which their husbands, or mothers, or\r\nsisters, or children, would express at welcoming them again; but I\r\nnever gave a word of such gossip; I only hearkened, and compared their\r\nhopes with my desolation, morosely and vindictively. Before I was\r\ndeclared perfectly restored I got very tired of my imprisonment;\r\nindeed the whole time I was in the convalescent ward my life was\r\nwearisome, and without any of the pleasures which the first days of my\r\nsickness had had. There was only one inmate of the ward to which I was\r\nat first admitted, as yet, amongst the convalescents; none of them\r\nknew me, unless it was by my number--a new one now, for on changing my\r\nward I had changed my number also. The nurses I didn't like so well as\r\nmy first kind attendant; and I couldn't feel charitably, or in any way\r\nas a Christian ought to feel, to the poor people by whom I was\r\nsurrounded.\r\n\r\n\"At length the day came for my discharge. The matron inquired of me\r\nwhere I was going; but I would not tell her; I would not acknowledge\r\nthat I had a sister--partly out of mere perverseness, and partly out\r\nof an angry sense of honour; for I was a country-bred woman, and\r\nattached to the thought of 'going into a hospital' a certain idea of\r\nshame and degradation, such as country people attach to 'going on the\r\nparish', and I was too proud to let folk know that my sister had a\r\nsister in an hospital, when she clearly flinched from having as much\r\nsaid of her.\r\n\r\n\"Well, finding I was not in a communicative humour, the matron asked\r\nno more questions; but, giving me a bundle containing a few articles\r\nof wearing apparel, and a small donation of money, bade me farewell;\r\nand without saying half as much in the way of gratitude as I ought to\r\nhave said, I walked out from the hospital garden into the wide streets\r\nof London. I did not go straight to my old lodgings, or to the house\r\nof the doctor who had been so kind to me; but I directed my steps to\r\nan inn in Holborn, and took a place in the stage-cart for Stratford.\r\nAs I rode slowly to my sister's town I thought within myself how I\r\nshould treat her. Somehow my heart had softened a great deal towards\r\nher during the few last days; a good spirit within me had set me\r\nthinking of how she had helped me to nurse my husband and baby--how\r\nshe had accompanied me when I followed them to their graves--how she\r\nand her husband had sacrificed themselves so much to assist me in my\r\ntrial; and the recollection of these kindnesses and proofs of sisterly\r\nlove, I am thankful to know, made me judge Martha much less harshly.\r\nYes! yes! I would forgive her! She had never offended me before! She\r\nhad not wronged me seven times, or seventy times seven, but only\r\n_once_! After all, how much she had done for me! Who was I, that I\r\nshould forget all that she had done, and judge her only by what she\r\nhad left undone?\r\n\r\n\"The stage-cart reached Stratford as the afternoon began to close into\r\nevening; and when I alighted from it, I started off at a brisk pace,\r\nand walked to my sister's cottage that stood on the outskirts of the\r\ntown. Strange to say, as I got nearer and nearer to her door my angry\r\nfeelings became fainter and fainter, and all my loving memories of her\r\nstrong affection for me worked so in me that my knees trembled beneath\r\nme, and my eyes were blinded with tears--though, if I had trusted my\r\ndeceitful, wicked, malicious tongue to speak, I should still have\r\ndeclared she was a bad, heartless, worthless, sister.\r\n\r\n\"I reached the threshold, and paused on the step before it, just to\r\nget my breath and to collect as much courage and presence of mind as\r\nwould let Martha know that, though I forgave her, I still was fully\r\naware she might have acted more nobly. When I knocked, after a few\r\nseconds, little Rhoda's steps pattered down the passage, and opened\r\nthe door. Why, the child was in black! What did that mean? Had\r\nanything happened to Martha or her husband, or little Tommy? But\r\nbefore I could put the question Rhoda turned deadly white, and ran\r\nback into the living-room. In another instant I heard Tommy screaming\r\nat the top of his voice; and in a trice I was in the room, with\r\nMartha's arms flung round my neck, and her dear blessed eyes covering\r\nme with tears.\r\n\r\n\"She was very ill in appearance; white and haggard, and, like Rhoda\r\nand Tommy, she too was dressed in black. For some minutes she could\r\nnot speak a word for sobbing hysterically; but when at last I had\r\nquieted her and kissed Rhoda, and cossetted Tommy till he had left off\r\nscreaming, I learnt that the mourning Martha and her children wore was\r\nin my honour. Sure enough Martha had received a notice from the\r\nhospital of my death; and she and Rhoda had not only presented\r\nthemselves at the hospital, and seen there a dead body which they\r\nbelieved to be mine, but they had also, with considerable expense, and\r\nmuch more loving care, had it interred in the Stratford churchyard,\r\nunder the impression that in so doing they were offering me the last\r\nrespect which it would be in their power to render me. The worst of\r\nit was that poor Martha had pined and sorrowed so for me that she\r\nseemed likely to fall into some severe illness.\r\n\r\n\"On inquiry it appeared that the morning when I and No. 22 were so\r\nmuch worse, and the doctor altered the directions of our boards, the\r\nnurse by mistake put the No. 22 board over my bed, and my board (No.\r\n11) over the bed of the poor woman who had died. The consequence was\r\nthat, when the hospital clerk was informed that No. 11 had died, he\r\nwrote to the doctor who placed me in the hospital, informing him of my\r\ndeath, and the doctor communicated the sad intelligence to my sister.\r\n\r\n\"The rest of the story you can fill up, sir, for yourself, and without\r\nmy assistance you can imagine how it was that, while in a state of\r\nextreme exhaustion, and deeming myself dead, I heard my sister, in a\r\nstrong agony of sorrow and self-reproach, say to my nurse, 'Oh, dear\r\nfriend--dear good nurse--if you have a sister, don't treat her, as I\r\ndid Abigail, with suspicion and wicked passion; for should you, all\r\nthe light speeches of your frowardness will return to you, and lie\r\nheavy on your heart when hers shall beat no more.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nMEDICAL BUILDINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe medical buildings of London are seldom or never visited by the\r\nsight-seers of the metropolis. Though the science and art of nursing\r\nhave recently been made sources of amusement to the patrons of\r\ncirculating libraries, the good sense and delicacy of the age are\r\nagainst converting the wards of an hospital into galleries for public\r\namusement. In the last century the reverse was the case. Fashionable\r\nidlers were not indeed anxious to pry into the mysteries of\r\nBartholomew's, Guy's, and St. Thomas's hospitals; for a visit to those\r\nmagnificent institutions was associated in their minds with a risk of\r\ncatching fevers or the disfiguring small-pox. But Bethlehem, devoted\r\nto the entertainment and cure of the insane, was a favourite haunt\r\nwith all classes. \"Pepys,\" \"The London Spy,\" \"The Tatler,\" and \"The\r\nRake's Progress,\" give us vivid pictures of a noisy rout of Pall Mall\r\nbeaus and belles, country fly-catchers, and London scamps, passing up\r\nand down the corridors of the great asylum, mocking its unhappy\r\ninmates with brutal jests, or investigating and gossiping about their\r\ndelusions and extravagances with unfeeling curiosity. Samuel Johnson\r\nenlivened himself with an occasional stroll amongst the lunatics, just\r\nas he periodically indulged himself with witnessing a hanging, a\r\njudicial flogging, or any other of the pleasant spectacles with which\r\nHogarth's London abounded. Boswell and he once strolled through the\r\nmansions of the insane; and on another occasion, when he visited the\r\nsame abode with Murphy, Foote, and Wedderburne (afterwards Lord\r\nLoughborough), the philosopher's \"attention was arrested by a man who\r\nwas very furious, and who, while beating his straw, supposed it was\r\nWilliam, Duke of Cumberland, whom he was punishing for his cruelties\r\nin Scotland in 1746.\" Steele, when he took three schoolboys (imagine\r\nthe glee of Sir Richard's schoolboy friends out with him for a frolic)\r\nin a hackney coach to show them the town, paid his respects to \"the\r\nlions, the tombs, Bedlam, and the other places, which are\r\nentertainments to raw minds because they strike forcibly on the\r\nfancy.\" In the same way Pepys \"stept into Bedlam, and saw several poor\r\nmiserable creatures in chains, one of whom was _mad with making\r\nverses_,\" a form of mental aberration not uncommon in these days,\r\nthough we do not deem it necessary to consign the victims of it to\r\nmedical guardianship.\r\n\r\nThe original Bethlehem hospital was established by Henry VIII., in a\r\nreligious house that had been founded in 1246, by Simon Fitz-Mary,\r\nSheriff of London, as an ecclesiastical body. The house was situated\r\nat Charing-cross, and very soon the king began to find it (when used\r\nfor the reception of lunatics) disagreeably near his own residence.\r\nThe asylum was therefore removed, at a \"cost nigh £17,000,\" to\r\nBishopgate Without, where it remained till 1814, and the inmates were\r\nremoved to the present noble hospital in St. George's Fields, the\r\nfirst stone of which was laid April 18th, 1812.\r\n\r\nOne of the regulations of old Bedlam has long since been disused. The\r\nharmless lunatics were allowed to roam about the country with a tin\r\nbadge--the star of St. Bethlehem--on the right arm. Tenderness towards\r\nthose to whom the Almighty has denied reason is a sentiment not\r\nconfined to the East. Wherever these poor creatures went they received\r\nalms and kindly entreatment. The ensign on the right arm announced to\r\nthe world their lamentable condition and their need of help, and the\r\nappeal was always mercifully responded to. Aubrey thus describes their\r\nappearance and condition:--\r\n\r\n\"Till the breaking out of the Civil Wars Tom o' Bedlams did travel\r\nabout the country. They had been poor distracted men, but had been put\r\ninto Bedlam, where recovering some soberness, they were licentiated to\r\ngo a-begging, _i. e._ they had on their left arm an armilla of tin,\r\nabout four inches long; they could not get it off. They wore about\r\ntheir necks a great horn of an ox in a string of baudry, which, when\r\nthey came to an house for alms, they did wind, and they did put the\r\ndrink given them into this horn, whereto they did put the stopple.\r\nSince the wars I do not remember to have seen any one of them.\"\r\n\r\nThe custom, however, continued long after the termination of the Civil\r\nWar. It is not now the humane practice to label our fools, so that\r\nsociety may at once recognise them and entertain them with kindness.\r\nThey still go at large in our public ways. Facilities are even given\r\nthem for effecting an entrance into the learned professions.\r\nFrequently they are docketed with titles of respect, and decked with\r\nthe robes of office. But however gratifying this plan may be to their\r\npersonal vanity it is not unattended with cruelty. Having about them\r\nno external mark of their sad condition, they are often, through\r\ncarelessness and misapprehension--not through hardness of\r\nheart--chastised with undue severity. \"Poor Tom, thy horn is dry,\"\r\nsays Edgar, in \"Lear.\" Never may the horn of mercy be dry to such poor\r\nwretches!\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that Easter holiday-makers are no longer\r\npermitted in swarms, on the payment of two-pence each, to race through\r\nthe St. Bethlehem galleries, insulting with their ribaldry the most\r\npitiable of God's afflicted creatures. A useful lesson, however, is\r\ntaught to the few strangers who still, as merely curious observers,\r\nobtain admission for a few minutes within the walls of the asylum--a\r\nlesson conveyed, not by the sufferings of the patients, so much as by\r\nthe gentle discipline, the numerous means of innocent amusement, and\r\nthe air of quiet contentment, which are the characteristics of a\r\nwell-managed hospital for the insane.\r\n\r\nNot less instructive would it be for many who now know of them only\r\nthrough begging circulars and charity dinners, to inspect the\r\nwell-ventilated, cleanly--and it may be added, _cheerful_--dwellings\r\nof the impoverished sick of London. The principal hospitals of the\r\ncapital, those, namely, to which medical schools are attached, are\r\neleven in number--St. George's, the London (at Mile End), University\r\nCollege, King's, St. Mary's, Westminster, Middlesex, and\r\nCharing-cross, are for the most part dependent on voluntary\r\ncontributions for support, the Westminster Hospital (instituted 1719)\r\nbeing the first hospital established in this kingdom on the voluntary\r\nsystem. The three other hospitals of the eleven have large endowments,\r\nBartholomew's and Guy's being amongst the wealthiest benevolent\r\nfoundations of the country.\r\n\r\nLike Bethlehem, St. Thomas's Hospital was originally a religious\r\nhouse. At the dissolution of the monasteries it was purchased by the\r\ncitizens of London, and, in the year 1552, was opened as an hospital\r\nfor the sick. At the commencement of the last century it was rebuilt\r\nby public subscription, three wards being erected at the cost of\r\nThomas Frederick, and three by Guy, the founder of Guy's Hospital.\r\n\r\nThe first place of precedency amongst the London Hospitals is\r\ncontended for by St. Bartholomew's and Guy's. They are both alike\r\nimportant by their wealth, the number of patients entertained within\r\ntheir walls, and the celebrity of the surgeons and physicians with\r\nwhom their schools have enriched the medical profession; but the\r\nformer, in respect of antiquity, has superior claims to respect.\r\nReaders require no introduction to the founder of Bartholomew's, for\r\nonly lately Dr. Doran, in his \"Court Fools,\" gave a sketch of\r\nRahere--the minstrel and jester, who spent his prime in the follies\r\nand vices of courts, and his riper years in the sacred offices of the\r\nreligious vocation. He began life a buffoon, and ended it a\r\nprior--presiding over the establishment to the creation of which he\r\ndevoted the wealth earned by his abused wit. The monk chronicler says\r\nof him: \"When he attained the flower of youth he began to haunt the\r\nhouseholds of noblemen and the palaces of princes; where, under every\r\nelbow of them, he spread their cushions with apeings and flatterings,\r\ndelectably anointing their eyes--by this manner to draw to him their\r\nfriendships. And yet he was not content with this, but often haunted\r\nthe king's palace; and, among the press of that tumultuous court,\r\nenforced himself with jollity and carnal suavity, by the which he\r\nmight draw to him the hearts of many one.\" But the gay adventurer\r\nfound that the ways of mirth were far from those of true gladness;\r\nand, forsaking quips, and jeers, and wanton ditties for deeds of\r\nmercy, and prayer, and songs of praise, he long was an ensample unto\r\nmen of holy living; and \"after the years of his prelacy (twenty-two\r\nyears and six months), the 20th day of September (A. D. 1143), the\r\nclay-house of this world forsook, and the house everlasting entered.\"\r\n\r\nIn the church of St. Bartholomew may still be seen the tomb of Dr.\r\nFrancis Anthony, who, in spite of the prosecutions of the College of\r\nPhysicians, enjoyed a large practice, and lived in pomp in Bartholomew\r\nClose, where he died in 1623. The merits of his celebrated nostrum,\r\nthe _aurum potabile_, to which Boyle gave a reluctant and qualified\r\napproval, are alluded to in the inscription commemorating his\r\nservices:--\r\n\r\n    \"There needs no verse to beautify thy praise,\r\n      Or keep in memory thy spotless name.\r\n    Religion, virtue, and thy skill did raise\r\n      A three-fold pillar to thy lasting fame.\r\n\r\n    Though poisonous envy ever sought to blame\r\n      Or hide the fruits of thy intention,\r\n    Yet shall all they commend that high design\r\n    Of purest gold to make a medicine,\r\n      That feel thy help by that thy rare invention.\"\r\n\r\nBoyle's testimony to the good results of the _aurum potabile_ is\r\ninteresting, as his philosophic mind formed a decided opinion on the\r\nefficacy of the preparation by observing its operation in _two_\r\ncases--persons of great note. \"Though,\" he says, \"I have long been\r\nprejudiced against the _aurum potabile_, and other boasted\r\npreparations of gold, for most of which I have no great esteem, yet I\r\nsaw such extraordinary and surprising effects from the tincture of\r\ngold I spake of (prepared by two foreign physicians) upon persons of\r\ngreat note, with whom I was particularly acquainted, both before they\r\nfell sick and after their dangerous recovery, that I could not but\r\nchange my opinion for a very favourable one as to some preparations of\r\ngold.\"\r\n\r\nAttached to his priory of St. Bartholomew's, Rahere founded an\r\nhospital for the relief of poor and sick persons, out of which has\r\ngrown the present institution, over the principal gateway of which\r\nstands, burly and with legs apart--like a big butcher watching his\r\nmeat-stall--an effigy of Henry VIII. Another of the art treasures of\r\nthe hospital is the staircase painted by Hogarth.\r\n\r\nIf an hospital could speak it could tell strange tales--of misery\r\nslowly wrought, ambition foiled, and fair promise ending in shame.\r\nMany a toilworn veteran has entered the wards of St. Bartholomew's to\r\ndie in the very couch by the side of which in his youth he daily\r\npassed--a careless student, joyous with the spring of life, and\r\nlittle thinking of the storm and unkind winds rising up behind the\r\nsmiles of the nearer future. Scholars of gentle birth, brave soldiers\r\nof proud lineage, patient women whose girlhood, spent in luxury and\r\nrefinement, has been followed by penury, evil entreatment, and\r\ndestitution, find their way to our hospitals--to pass from a world of\r\ngrief to one where sorrow is not. It is not once in awhile, but daily,\r\nthat a physician of any large charitable institution of London reads a\r\npathetic tale of struggle and defeat, of honest effort and bitter\r\nfailure, of slow descent from grade to grade of misfortune--in the\r\ntranquil dignity, the mild enduring quiet, and noiseless gratitude of\r\npoor sufferers--gentle once in fortune, gentle still in nature. One\r\nhears unpleasant stories of medical students, their gross dissipations\r\nand coarse manners. Possibly these stories have their foundation in\r\nfact, but at best they are broad and unjust caricatures. This writer\r\nin his youth lived much amongst the students of our hospitals, as he\r\ndid also amongst those of our old universities, and he found them\r\nsimple and manly in their lives, zealous in the pursuit of knowledge,\r\nanimated by _a professional esprit_ of the best sort, earnestly\r\nbelieving in the dignity of their calling, and characterised by a\r\nsingular ever-lively compassion for all classes of the desolate and\r\ndistressed. And this quality of mercy, which unquestionably adorns in\r\nan eminent degree the youth of our medical schools, he has always\r\nregarded as a happy consequence of their education, making them\r\nacquainted, in the most practical and affecting manner, with the sad\r\nvicissitudes of human existence.\r\n\r\nGuy's hospital was the benevolent work of a London bookseller, who, by\r\nperseverance, economy, and lucky speculation, amassed a very large\r\nfortune. Thomas Guy began life with a stock of about £200, as a\r\nstationery and bookseller in a little corner house between Cornhill\r\nand Lombard-st., taking out his freedom of the Stationers' Company in\r\n1668. He was a thrifty tradesman, but he won his wealth rather by\r\nstock-jobbing than by the sale of books, although he made important\r\nsums by his contract with the University of Oxford for their privilege\r\nof printing bibles. Maitland informs us, \"England being engaged in an\r\nexpensive war against France, the poor seamen on board the royal navy,\r\nfor many years, instead of money received tickets for their pay, which\r\nthose necessitous but very useful men were obliged to dispose of at\r\nthirty, forty, and sometimes fifty in the hundred discount. Mr. Guy,\r\ndiscovering the sweets of this traffick, became an early dealer\r\ntherein, as well as in other government securities, by which, and his\r\ntrade, he acquired a very great estate.\" In the South-sea stock he was\r\nnot less lucky. He bought largely at the outset, held on till the\r\nbubble reached its full size, and ere the final burst sold out. It may\r\nbe questioned whether Guy's or Rahere's money was earned the more\r\nhonourably,--whether to fawn, flatter, and jest at the table of\r\nprinces was a meaner course of exertion than to drive a usurious trade\r\nwith poor sailors, and fatten on a stupendous national calamity. But\r\nhowever basely it may have been gathered together, Guy's wealth was\r\nwell expended, in alleviating the miseries of the same classes from\r\nwhose sufferings it had been principally extracted. In his old age\r\nGuy set about building his hospital, and ere his death, in 1724, saw\r\nit completed. On its erection and endowment he expended £238,292\r\n16_s._ 5_d._ To his honour it must be stated that, notwithstanding\r\nthis expenditure and his munificent contributions to other charities,\r\nhe had a considerable residue of property, which he distributed\r\namongst his poor relations.\r\n\r\nOf the collegiate medical buildings of London, the one that belongs to\r\nthe humblest department of the profession is the oldest, and for that\r\nreason--apart from its contents, which are comparatively of little\r\nvalue--the most interesting. Apothecaries' Hall, in Water Lane,\r\nBlackfriars, was built in 1670. Possibly the size and imposing aspect\r\nof their college stimulated the drug-vendors to new encroachments on\r\nthe prescriptive and enacted rights of the physicians. The rancour of\r\n\"The Dispensary\" passes over the merits (graces it has none) of the\r\nstructure, and designates it by mentioning its locality--\r\n\r\n    \"Nigh where Fleet Ditch descends in sable streams,\r\n    To wash his sooty Naiads in the Thames,\r\n    There stands a structure on a rising hill,\r\n    Where tyros take their freedom out to kill.\"\r\n\r\nAmongst the art-treasures of the hall are a portrait of James I. (who\r\nfirst established the apothecaries as a company distinct from the\r\ngrocers), and a bust of Delaune, the lucky apothecary of that\r\nmonarch's queen, who has already been mentioned in these pages.\r\n\r\nThe elegant college of the physicians, in Pall Mall east, was not\r\ntaken into use till the 25th of June, 1825, the doctors migrating to\r\nit from Warwick Hall, which is now in the occupation of the butchers\r\nof Newgate Market. Had the predecessors of the present tenants been\r\n\"the surgeons,\" instead of \"the physicians,\" the change of masters\r\nwould have given occasion for a joke. As it is, not even the\r\nconsolation of a jest can be extracted from the desecration of an\r\nabode of learning that has many claims on our affection.\r\n\r\nIn \"The Dispensary,\" the proximity of the college dome to the Old\r\nBailey is playfully pointed at:--\r\n\r\n    \"Not far from that most celebrated place,\r\n    Where angry justice shows her awful face,\r\n    Where little villains must submit to fate,\r\n    That great ones may enjoy the world in state,\r\n    There stands a dome, majestic to the sight,\r\n    And sumptuous arches bear its oval height;\r\n    A golden globe, placed high with artful skill,\r\n    Seems, to the distant sight, a gilded pill:\r\n    This pile was, by the pious patron's aim,\r\n    Raised for a use as noble as its frame.\r\n    Nor did the learn'd society decline\r\n    The propagation of that great design;\r\n    In all her mazes, Nature's face they view'd,\r\n    And, as she disappear'd, their search pursued.\r\n    Wrapt in the shade of night, the goddess lies,\r\n    Yet to the learn'd unveils her dark disguise,\r\n    But shuns the gross access of vulgar eyes.\"\r\n\r\nThe Warwick Lane college was erected on the college at Amen Corner (to\r\nwhich the physicians removed on quitting their original abode in\r\nKnight-Rider Street), being burnt to the ground in the great fire of\r\n1666. Charles II. and Sir John Cutler were ambitious of having their\r\nnames associated with the new edifice, the chief fault of which was\r\nthat, like all the other restorations following the memorable\r\nconflagration, it was raised near the old site. Charles became its\r\npious patron, and Sir John Cutler its munificent benefactor. The\r\nphysicians duly thanked them, and honoured them with statues, Cutler's\r\neffigy having inscribed beneath it, \"Omnis Cutleri cedat labor\r\nAmphitheatro.\"\r\n\r\nSo far, so good. The fun of the affair remains to be told. On Sir\r\nJohn's death, his executors, Lord Radnor and Mr. Boulter, demanded of\r\nthe college £7000, which covered in amount a sum the college had\r\nborrowed of their deceased benefactor, and also the sum he pretended\r\nto have given. Eventually the executors lowered their claim to £2000\r\n(which, it is reasonable to presume, had been _lent_ by Sir John), and\r\ndiscontinued their demand for the £5000 given. Such being the stuff of\r\nwhich Sir John was made, well might Pope exclaim:--\r\n\r\n    \"His Grace's fate sage Cutler could foresee,\r\n    And well (he thought) advised him, 'Live like me.'\r\n    As well his Grace replied, 'Like you, Sir John?\r\n    That I can do when all I have is gone.'\"\r\n\r\nIn consideration of the £5000 retained of the niggard's money, the\r\nphysicians allowed his statue to remain, but they erased the\r\ninscription from beneath it.\r\n\r\nThe Royal College of Surgeons in London was not incorporated till the\r\nyear 1800--more than half a century after the final disruption of the\r\nsurgeons from the barbers--and the college in Lincoln's Inn Fields was\r\nnot erected till 1835. Its noble museum, based on the Hunterian\r\nCollection, which the nation purchased for £15,000, contains, amongst\r\nits treasures, a few preparations that are valuable for their\r\nhistorical associations or sheer eccentricity, rather than for any\r\nworth from a strictly scientific point of view. Amongst them are\r\nMartin Van Buchell's first wife, whose embalmment by William Hunter\r\nhas already been mentioned; the intestines of Napoleon, showing the\r\nprogress of the disease which was eventually fatal to him; and the\r\nfore-arms (preserved in spirits) of Thomas Beaufort, third son of John\r\nof Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster.\r\n\r\nThe writer had recently submitted to his notice, by Dr. Diamond of\r\nTwickenham, a very interesting and beautifully penned manuscript,\r\nrelating to these remains, of which the following is a copy:--\r\n\r\n                        \"BURY ST EDMUNDS.\r\n\r\n  \"_Joseph Pater scripsit, when thirteen years of age._\r\n\r\n\"On the 20th of February, 1772, some labourers, employed in breaking\r\nup part of the old abbey church, discovered a leaden coffin, which\r\ncontained an embalmed body, as perfect and entire as at the time of\r\nits death; the features and lineaments of the face were perfect, which\r\nwere covered with a mask of embalming materials. The very colour of\r\nthe eyes distinguishable; the hairs of the head a brown, intermixed\r\nwith some few gray ones; the nails fast upon the fingers and toes as\r\nwhen living; stature of the body about six feet tall, and genteelly\r\nformed. The labourers, for the sake of the lead (which they sold to Mr\r\nFaye, a plummer, in this town, for about 15s), stript the body of its\r\ncoffin, and threw it promiscuously amongst the rubbish. From the place\r\nof its interment it was soon found to be the remains of Thomas\r\nBeaufort, third son of John de Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, by his third\r\nduchess, Lady Catherine Swineford, relict of Sir Otho de Swineford, of\r\nLincolnshire. He took the name of Beaufort from the place of his\r\nbirth, a castle of the duke's, in France. He was half-brother to King\r\nHenry IV., created Duke of Exeter and Knight of the Garter; in 1410,\r\nLord Chancellor of England; in 1412, High Admiral of England, and\r\nCaptain of Calais; he commanded the Rear-Guard of his nephew King\r\nHenry the Fifth's army at the battle of Agincourt, on the 25th of\r\nOctober, 1415; and in 1422, upon the death of King Henry the Fifth,\r\nwas jointly with his brother, Henry, Cardinal Bishop of Winchester,\r\nappointed by the Parliament to the government, care, and education of\r\nthe royal infant, Henry the Sixth. He married Margaret, daughter of\r\nSir Thomas Nevil, by whom he had issue only one son, who died young.\r\nHe was a great benefactor to this church, died at East Greenwich,\r\n1427, in the 5th year of King Henry ye Sixth, and was interred in this\r\nAbbey, near his duchess (as he had by his will directed), at the\r\nentrance of the Chapel of our Lady, close to the wall. On the 24th of\r\nFebruary following, the mangled remains were enclosed in an oak\r\ncoffin, and buried about eight feet deep, close to the north side of\r\nthe north-east pillar, which formerly assisted to support the Abbey\r\nbelfry. Before its re-interment, the body was mangled and cut with the\r\nmost savage barbarity by Thomas Gery Cullum, a young surgeon in this\r\ntown, lately appointed Bath King-at-Arms. The skull sawed in pieces,\r\nwhere the brain appeared it seemed somewhat wasted, but perfectly\r\ncontained in its proper membranes; the body ript open from the neck to\r\nthe bottom, the cheek cut through by a saw entering at the mouth; his\r\narms chopped off below the elbows and taken away. One of the arms the\r\nsaid Cullum confesses to have in spirits. The crucifix, supposed to be\r\na very valuable one, is missing. It is believed the body of the\r\nduchess was found (within about a foot of the Duke's) on the 24th of\r\nFebruary. If she was buried in lead she was most likely conveyed away\r\nclandestinely the same night. In this church several more of the\r\nantient royal blood were interred, whose remains are daily expected to\r\nshare the same fate. Every sensible and humane mind reflects with\r\nhorror at the shocking and wanton inhumanity with which the princely\r\nremains of the grandson of the victorious King Edward the Third have\r\nbeen treated--worse than the body of a common malefactor, and 345\r\nyears after his death. The truth of this paragraph having been\r\nartfully suppressed, or very falsely represented in the county\r\nnewspapers, and the conveyance of public intelligence rendered\r\ndoubtful, no method could be taken to convey a true account to the\r\npublic but by this mode of offering it.\"\r\n\r\nThe young surgeon whose conduct is here so warmly censured was the\r\nyounger son of a Suffolk baronet. On the death of his brother he\r\nsucceeded to the family estate and honours, and having no longer any\r\nnecessity to exert himself to earn money, relinquished medical\r\npractice. He was born in 1741 and died in 1831. It is from him that\r\nthe present baronet, of Hawstead Place and Hardwicke House, in the\r\ncounty of Suffolk, is descended.\r\n\r\nThe fore-arms, now in the custody of the College of Surgeons, were for\r\na time separated. One of them was retained by Mr. Cullum, and the\r\nother, becoming the property of some mute inglorious Barnum, was taken\r\nabout to all the fairs and wakes of the county, and exhibited as a\r\nraree-show at a penny a peep. The vagrant member, however, came back\r\nafter a while to Mr. Cullum, and he presented both of the mutilated\r\npertions to their present possessors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nTHE COUNTRY MEDICAL MAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe country doctor, such as we know him--a well-read and observant\r\nman, skilful in his art, with a liberal love of science, and in every\r\nrespect a gentleman--is so recent a creation, that he may almost be\r\nspoken of as a production of the present century. There still linger\r\nin the provinces veteran representatives of the ignorance which, in\r\nthe middle of the last century, was the prevailing characteristic of\r\nthe rural apothecary. Even as late as 1816, the law required no\r\nmedical education in a practitioner of the healing art in country\r\ndistricts, beyond an apprenticeship to an empiric, who frequently had\r\nnot information of any kind, beyond the rudest elements of a\r\ndruggist's learning, to impart to his pupils. Men who commenced\r\nbusiness under this system are still to be found in every English\r\ncounty, though in most cases they endeavour to conceal their lack of\r\nscientific culture under German or Scotch diplomas--bought for a few\r\npounds.\r\n\r\nScattered over these pages are many anecdotes of provincial doctors in\r\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, from which a truthful but\r\nnot complimentary picture of their order may be obtained. Indeed, they\r\nwere for the most part vulgar drunken knaves, with just learning\r\nenough to impose on the foolish crowds who resorted to them. The most\r\nbrilliant of the fraternity in Henry the Eighth's reign was Andrew\r\nBorde, a Winchester practitioner. This gentleman was author and\r\nbuffoon, as well as physician. He travelled about the country from\r\nmarket to fair, and from fair to market, making comic orations to the\r\ncrowds who purchased his nostrums, singing songs, and enlivening the\r\nproceedings when they were becoming dull with grimaces of\r\ninexpressible drollery. It was said of Sir John Hill,\r\n\r\n    \"For physic and farces\r\n      His equal there scarce is;\r\n    His farces are physic,\r\n      His physic a farce is.\"\r\n\r\nBorde's physic doubtless was a farce; but if his wit resembled physic,\r\nit did so, not (like Hill's) by making men sick, but by rousing their\r\nspirits and bracing their nerves with good hearty laughter. Everywhere\r\nhe was known as \"Merry Andrew,\" and his followers, when they mounted\r\nthe bank, were proud to receive the same title.\r\n\r\nMr. H. Fleetwood Sheppard communicated in the year 1855, some amusing\r\nanecdotes to \"Notes and Queries\" about the popular Dorsetshire\r\ndoctor--little Dr. Grey. Small but warlike, this gentleman, in the\r\nreign of James the First, had a following of well-born roisterers that\r\nenabled him to beard the High Sheriff at the assizes. He was always in\r\ndebt, but as he always carried a brandy-flask and a brace of loaded\r\npistols in his pocket or about his neck, he neither experienced the\r\nmental harass of impecuniosity nor feared bailiffs. In the hour of\r\nperil he blew a horn, which he wore suspended to his person, and the\r\ngentlemen of his body-guard rallied round him, vowing they were his\r\n\"sons,\" and would die for him. Says the MS.--\"This Doctor Grey was\r\nonce arreste by a pedler, who coming to his house knocked at ye dore\r\nas yey (he being desirous of Hobedyes) useth to doe, and ye pedler\r\nhaving gartars upon his armes, and points, &c., asked him whether he\r\ndid wante any points or gartars, &c., pedler like. Grey hereat began\r\nto storme, and ye other tooke him by ye arme, and told him that he had\r\nno neede be so angry, and holdinge him fast, told him y he had ye\r\nkinge's proces for him, and showed him his warrant. 'Hast thou?' quoth\r\nGrey, and stoode stil awhile; but at length, catchinge ye fellowe by\r\nboth ends of his collar before, held him fast, and _drawinge out a\r\ngreat rundagger, brake his head in two or three places_.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, Dr. Grey \"came one day at ye assizes, wheare ye sheriffe had\r\nsome sixty men, and he wth his twenty sonnes, ye trustyest young\r\ngentlemen and of ye best sort and rancke, came and drancke in\r\nDorchester before ye sheriffe, and bad who dare to touch him; _and so\r\nafter awhile blew his horn and came away_.\" On the same terms who\r\nwould not like to be a Dorsetshire physician?\r\n\r\nIn 1569 (_vide_ \"Roberts' History of the Southern Counties\") Lyme had\r\nno medical practitioner. And at the beginning of the seventeenth\r\ncentury Sir Symonds D'Ewes was brought into the world at Coxden Hall,\r\nnear Axminster, by a female practitioner, who deformed him for life by\r\nher clumsiness. Yet more, Mrs. D'Ewes set out with her infant for\r\nLondon, when the babe, unable to bear the jolting of the carriage,\r\nscreamed itself into a violent illness, and had to be left behind at\r\nDorchester under the care of another doctress--Mrs. Margaret Waltham.\r\nAnd two generations later, in 1665, the Rev. Giles Moore, of Essex,\r\nhad to send twenty-five miles for an ordinary medical man, who was\r\npaid 12_s._ per visit, and the same distance for a physician, whose\r\nfee was £1--a second physician, who came and stayed two days, being\r\npaid £1 10_s._\r\n\r\nOf the country doctors of the middle and close of the last century,\r\nDr. Slop is a fair specimen. They were a rude, vulgar, keen-witted set\r\nof men, possessing much the same sort of intelligence, and disfigured\r\nby the same kind of ignorance, as a country gentleman expects now to\r\nfind in his farrier. They had to do battle with the village nurses at\r\nthe best on equal terms, often at a disadvantage; masculine dignity\r\nand superior medical erudition being in many districts of less account\r\nthan the force of old usage, and the sense of decorum that supported\r\nthe lady practitioners. Mrs. Shandy had an express provision in her\r\nmarriage settlement, securing her from the ignorance of country\r\ndoctors. Of course, in respect to learning and personal acquirements,\r\nthe rural practitioners, as a class, varied very much, in accordance\r\nwith the intelligence and culture of the district in which their days\r\nwere spent, with the class and character of their patients, and with\r\ntheir own connections and original social condition. On his Yorkshire\r\nliving Sterne came in contact with a rought lot. The Whitworth Taylors\r\nwere captains and leaders of the army in which Dr. Slop was a\r\nprivate. The original of the last-mentioned worthy was so ill-read\r\nthat he mistook Lithopædii Senonensis Icon for the name of a\r\ndistinguished surgical authority, and, under this erroneous\r\nimpression, quoted Lithopædus Senonensis with the extreme of gravity.\r\n\r\nThis Lithopædus Senonensis story is not without its companions. A\r\nprescription, in which a physician ordered _extract, rad valer._, and\r\nimmediately under it, as an ingredient in the same mixture, a certain\r\nquantity of _tinctura ejusdem_, sorely perplexed the poor apothecary\r\nto who it was sent to be dispensed. _Tinctura ejusdem!_ What could it\r\nbe! _Ejusdem!_ In the whole pharmacopoeia such a drug was not named.\r\nNothing like it was to be found on any label in his shop. At his wits'\r\nend, the poor fellow went out to a professional neighbour, and asked,\r\nin an off-hand way, \"How are you off for _Tinctura Ejusdem_? I am out\r\nof it. So can you let me have a little of yours.\" The neighbour, who\r\nwas a sufficiently good classical scholar to have _idem_, _eadem_,\r\n_idem_ at his tongue's end, lamented that he too was \"out of the\r\narticle.\" and sympathizingly advised his _confrère_, without loss of\r\ntime, to apply for some at Apothecaries' Hall. What a delightful\r\nblunder to make to a _friend_, of all the people in the world! The\r\napothecary must have been a dull as well as an unlettered fellow, or\r\nhe would have known the first great rule of his art--\"When in\r\ndoubt--_Use water!_\" A more awkward mistake still was that made by the\r\nyoung dispenser, who, for the first time in his life, saw at the end\r\nof a prescription the words _pro re natâ_. What could they mean? _pro\r\nre natâ!_ What could _pro re natâ_ have to do with a mixture sent to\r\na lady who had just presented her husband with an heir. With the aid\r\nof a Latin Dictionary, the novice rendered _pro re natâ_ \"for the\r\nthing born.\" Of course. Clearly the mixture was for the baby. And in a\r\ntrice the compound to be taken by an adult, as circumstances should\r\nindicate a necessity for a dose, was sent off for the \"little\r\nstranger.\"\r\n\r\nMay not mention here be made of thee, ancient friend of childhood,\r\nRoland Trevor? The whole country round, for a circle of which the\r\ndiameter measured thirty fair miles, thou wert one of the most popular\r\ndoctors of East Anglia. Who rode better horses? Who was the bolder in\r\nthe hunt, or more joyous over the bottle? Cheery of voice, with hearty\r\nlaughter rolling from purple lips, what company thou wert to festive\r\nsquires! The grave some score years since closed over thee, when\r\nninety-six years had passed over thy head--covering it with silver\r\ntresses, and robbing the eye of its pristine fire, and the lip of its\r\nmirthful curl. The shop of a country apothecary had been thy only\r\n_Alma Mater_; so, surely, it was no fault of thine if thy learning was\r\nscanty. Still, in the pleasant vales of Loes and Wilford is told the\r\nstory of how, on being asked if thou wert a believer in _phrenology_,\r\nthou didst answer with becoming gravity, \"I never keep it, and I never\r\nuse it. But I think it highly probable that, given frequently and in\r\nliberal doses, it would be very useful in certain cases of irregular\r\ngout.\"\r\n\r\nAnother memory arises of a country doctor of the old school. A huge,\r\nburly, surly, churlish old fellow was Dr. Standish. He died in\r\nextremely advanced age, having lived twenty-five years in the present\r\ncentury. A ferocious radical, he was an object of considerable public\r\ninterest during the period of political excitement consequent on the\r\nFrench Revolution. Tom Paine, the Thetford breeches-maker of whom the\r\nworld has heard a little, was his familiar friend and correspondent.\r\nIt was rumoured throughout the land that \"government\" had marked the\r\ndoctor out for destruction.\r\n\r\n\"Thar sai,\" the humbler Suffolk farmers used to gossip amongst\r\nthemselves, \"thar sai a picter-taikin chap hav guv his poortright to\r\nthe King. And Billy Pitt ha'sin it. And oold King Georgie ha' swaren\r\nas how that sooner nor later he'll hav his hid\" (_i. e._ head).\r\n\r\nThe \"upper ten\" of Holmnook, and the upper ten-times-ten of the\r\ndistance round about Holmnook, held themselves aloof from such a\r\ndangerous character. But the common folk believed in and admired him.\r\nThere was something of romance about a man whom George III. and Billy\r\nPitt were banded together to destroy.\r\n\r\nStandish was a man of few words. \"Down with the bishops!\" \"Up with the\r\npeople!\" were his stock sentiments. He never approached nearer poetry\r\nthan when (yellow being then the colour of the extreme liberal party\r\nin his district) he swore \"there worn't a flower in the who' o'\r\ncrashun warth lookin' at but a sunflower, for that was yallow, and a\r\nbig un.\"\r\n\r\nThe man had no friends in Holmnook or the neighbourhood; but every\r\nevening for fifty years he sate, in the parlour of the chief inn,\r\ndrinking brandy-and-water, and smoking a \"churchwarden.\" His\r\nwife--(his wooing must have been of a queer sort)--a quiet,\r\ninoffensive little body, sometimes forgot she was but a woman, and\r\npresumed to have an opinion of her own. On such occasions Standish\r\nthrashed her soundly with a dog-whip. In consequence of one of these\r\ncastigations she ran away from her tyrant. Instead of pursuing her,\r\nDr. Standish merely inserted the following advertisement in the county\r\npaper:--\r\n\r\n\"_Dr Standish to all whom it may concern._--Dr Standish's wife having\r\nrun away, he wants a housekeeper. Dr Standish doesn't want good looks\r\nin a woman: but she must know how to hold her tongue and cook a plain\r\njoint. He gives ten pounds. Mrs Standish needn't apply--she's too much\r\nof a lady.\"\r\n\r\nBut poor Mrs. Standish did apply, and, what is more, obtained the\r\nsituation. She and her lord never again had any quarrel that obtained\r\npublicity; and so the affair ended more happily than in all\r\nprobability it would have done had Sir Creswell Creswell's court been\r\nthen in existence. Standish's practice lay principally amongst the\r\nmechanics and little farmers of the neighborhood. Much of his time was\r\ntherefore spent in riding his two huge lumbering horses about the\r\ncountry. In his old age he indulged himself in a gig (which, out of\r\nrespect to radical politics, he painted with a flaring yellow paint);\r\nbut, at the commencement of the present century, the by-roads of\r\nSuffolk--now so good that a London brougham drawn by one horse can\r\nwith ease whisk over the worst of them at the rate of ten miles an\r\nhour--were so bad that a doctor could not make an ordinary round on\r\nthem in a wheeled carriage. Even in the saddle he ran frequent risk\r\nof being mired, unless his horse had an abundance of bone and pluck.\r\n\r\nStandish's mode of riding was characteristic of the man. Straight on\r\nhe went, at a lumbering six miles an hour trot--dash, dosh,\r\ndush!--through the muddy roads, sitting loosely in his seat, heavy and\r\nshapeless as a sack of potatoes, looking down at his brown corduroy\r\nbreeches and his mahogany top-boots (the toes of which pointed in\r\ndirectly opposite directions), wearing a perpetual scowl on his brows,\r\nand never either rising in his stirrups or fixing himself to the\r\nsaddle with his knees. Not a word would he speak to a living creature\r\nin the way of civil greeting.\r\n\r\n\"Doctor, good morning to you,\" an acquaintance would cry out; \"'tis a\r\nnice day!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ugh!\" Standish would half grunt, half roar, trotting straight\r\non--dish, dosh, dush!\r\n\r\n\"Stop, doctor, I am out of sorts, and want some physic,\" would be the\r\nsecond form of address.\r\n\r\n\"Then why the ---- ---- didn't you say so, instead of jawing about the\r\nweather?\" the urbane physician would say, checking his horse.\r\n\r\nStandish never turned out an inch for any wayfarer. Sullen and\r\noverbearing, he rode straight on upon one side of the road; and,\r\nhowever narrow the way might be, he never swerved a barley-corn from\r\nhis line for horse or rider, cart or carriage. Our dear friend Charley\r\nHalifax gave him a smart lesson in good manners on this point. Charley\r\nhad brought a well-bred hackney, and a large fund of animal spirits,\r\ndown from Cambridge to a title for orders in mid-Suffolk. He had met\r\nStandish in the cottages of some of his flock, and afterwards meeting\r\nelsewhere, had greeted him, and had no greeting in return. It was not\r\nlong ere Charley learnt all about the clownish apothecary, and\r\nspeedily did he devise a scheme for humbling him. The next time he saw\r\nStandish in the distance, trotting on towards him, Charley put his\r\nheels to his horse, and charged the man of drugs at full gallop.\r\nStandish came lumbering on, disdaining to look before him and\r\nascertain who was clattering along at such a pace. On arriving within\r\nsix feet of Standish's horse, Halifax fell back on his curb-rein, and\r\npulled up sharp. Astonished, but more sensible than his master,\r\nStandish's horse (as Charley knew would be the case) suddenly came to\r\na dead stop, on which Standish rolled over its head into the muddy\r\nhighway. As he rolled over, he threw out a volley of oaths. \"Ah,\r\ndoctor,\" cried Charley, good-humoredly, \"I said I would make you speak\r\nto me.\" Standish was six feet high, and a powerful man. For a few\r\nmoments, on recovering his legs, he looked as if he contemplated an\r\nassault on the young parson. But he thought better of it; and,\r\nclimbing into his seat once more, trotted on, without another\r\nword--dish, dosh, dush! The incident didn't tend to soften his\r\nfeelings toward the Established Church.\r\n\r\nThe country doctor of the last century always went his rounds on\r\nhorseback booted and spurred. The state of the roads rendered any\r\nother mode of travelling impracticable to men who had not only to use\r\nthe highways and coach-roads, but to make their way up bridle-paths,\r\nand drifts, and lanes, to secluded farmsteads and outlying villages.\r\nEven as late as the last generation, in Suffolk, where now people\r\ndrive to and fro at the rate of twelve miles an hour, a doctor (whom\r\nthe writer of these pages has reason to think of with affection) was\r\nmore than once mired, on a slightly-built blood horse, so effectually,\r\nthat he had to dismount ere the animal could be extricated; and this\r\nhappened in roads that at the present time are, in all seasons, firm\r\nas a garden walk.\r\n\r\nDescribing the appearance of a country doctor of this period, a writer\r\nobserves--\"When first I saw him, it was on Frampton Green. I was\r\nsomewhat his junior in years, and had heard so much of him that I had\r\nno small curiosity to see him. He was dressed in a blue coat and\r\nyellow buttons, buckskins, well-polished jockey-boots, with handsome\r\nsilver spurs, and he carried a smart whip with a silver handle. His\r\nhair, after the fashion, was done up in a club, and he wore a\r\nbroad-brimmed hat.\" Such was the appearance of Jenner, as he galloped\r\nacross the vale of Gloucester, visiting his patients. There is little\r\nto remind us of such a personage as this in the statue in Trafalgar\r\nSquare, which is the slowly-offered tribute of our gratitude to Edward\r\nJenner for his imperishable services to mankind. The opposition that\r\nJenner met with in his labours to free our species from a hideous\r\nmalady that, destroying life and obliterating beauty, spared neither\r\nthe cottage nor the palace, is a subject on which it is painful to\r\nreflect. The learned of his own profession and the vulgar of all ranks\r\ncombined to persecute and insult him; and when the merit of his\r\ninestimable discovery was acknowledged by all intelligent persons, he\r\nreceived from his country a remuneration that was little better than\r\ntotal neglect.\r\n\r\nWhile acting as an apprentice to a country surgeon he first conceived\r\nthe possibility of checking the ravages of small-pox. A young servant\r\nwoman, who accidentally said that she was guarded from that disease by\r\nhaving \"had cow-pox,\" first apprized him that amongst the servants of\r\na rural population a belief existed that the virus from the diseased\r\ncow, on being absorbed by the human system, was a preventive against\r\nsmall-pox. From that time, till the ultimate success of his inquiries,\r\nhe never lost sight of the subject.\r\n\r\nThe ridicule and misrepresentation to which he was subjected are at\r\nthis date more pleasant for us to laugh at than, at the time, they\r\nwere for him to bear. The ignorant populace of London was instructed\r\nthat people, on being vaccinated, ran great risks of being converted\r\ninto members of the bovine family. The appearance of hair covering the\r\nwhole body, of horns and a tail, followed in many cases the operation.\r\nThe condition of an unhappy child was pathetically described, who,\r\nbrutified by vaccine ichor, persisted in running on all-fours and\r\nroaring like a bull. Dr. Woodville and Dr. Moseley opposed Jenner, the\r\nlatter with a violence that little became a scientific inquirer.\r\nNumerous were the squibs and caricatures the controversy called forth.\r\nJenner was represented as riding on a cow--an animal certainly not\r\nadapted to show the doctor (\"booted and spurred\" as we have just seen\r\nhim) off to the best advantage. Of Moseley the comic muse sung:\r\n\r\n    \"Oh, Moseley! thy book, nightly phantasies rousing,\r\n      Full oft makes me quake for my heart's dearest treasure;\r\n    For fancy, in dreams, oft presents them all browsing\r\n      On commons, just like little Nebuchadnezzar.\r\n    _There_, nibbling at thistle, stand Jem, Joe, and Mary,\r\n      On their foreheads, O horrible! crumpled horns bud:\r\n    There Tom with his tail, and poor William all hairy,\r\n      Reclined in a corner, are chewing the cud.\"\r\n\r\nIf London was unjust to him, the wiseacres of Gloucestershire thought\r\nthat burning was his fit punishment. One dear old lady, whenever she\r\nsaw him leaving his house, used to run out and attack him with\r\nindescribable vivacity. \"So your book,\" cried this charming matron, in\r\ngenuine Gloucestershire dialect, \"is out at last. Well! I can tell you\r\nthat there bean't a copy sold in our town, nor shan't neither, if I\r\ncan help it.\" On hearing, subsequent to the publication of the book (a\r\ngreat offence to the old lady!), some rumours of vaccination failures,\r\nthe same goodie bustled up to the doctor and cried, with galling\r\nirony, \"Shan't us have a general inoculation now?\"\r\n\r\nBut Jenner was compensated for this worthy woman's opposition in the\r\nenthusiastic support of Rowland Hill, who not only advocated\r\nvaccination in his ordinary conversation, but from the pulpit used to\r\nsay, after his sermon to his congregation, wherever he preached, \"I am\r\nready to vaccinate to-morrow morning as many children as you choose;\r\nand if you wish them to escape that horrid disease, the small-pox, you\r\nwill bring them.\" A Vaccine Board was also established at the Surrey\r\nChapel--_i. e._ the Octagon Chapel, in Blackfriars Road.\r\n\r\n\"My Lord,\" said Rowland Hill once to a nobleman, \"allow me to present\r\nto your Lordship my friend, Dr. Jenner, who has been the means of\r\nsaving more lives than any other man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" observed Jenner, \"would that I, like you, could say--souls.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no cant in this. Jenner was a simple, unaffected, and devout\r\nman. His last words were, \"I do not marvel that men are grateful to\r\nme, but I am surprised that they do not feel gratitude to God for\r\nmaking me a medium of good.\"\r\n\r\nOf Jenner's more sprightly humour, the following epigrams from his pen\r\n(communicated to the writer of these pages by Dr. E. D. Moore of\r\nSalop), are good specimens.\r\n\r\n\r\n              \"TO MY SPANISH CIGAR.\r\n\r\n    \"Soother of an anxious hour!\r\n      Parent of a thousand pleasures!\r\n    With gratitude I owe thy power\r\n      And place thee 'mongst my choicest treasures.\r\n    Thou canst the keenest pangs disarm\r\n      Which care obtrudes upon the heart;\r\n    At thy command, my little charm,\r\n      Quick from the bosom they depart.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n          \"ON THE DEATH OF JOHN AND BETTY COLE.\r\n\r\n    \"Why, neighbours, thus mournfully sorrow and fret?\r\n    Here lie snug and cosy old John and his Bet;\r\n    Your sighing and sobbing ungodly and rash is,\r\n    For two knobs of coal that have now gone to ashes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"ON MISS JENNER AND MISS EMILY WORTHINGTON TEARING THE \"GLOBE\"\r\n                       NEWSPAPER.\r\n\r\n    \"The greatest curse that hath a name\r\n    Most certainly from woman came.\r\n    Two of the sex the other night--\r\n    Well arm'd with talons, venom, spite,--\r\n    Pull'd caps, you say?--a great wonder!\r\n    By Jove, they pull'd the globe asunder!\"\r\n\r\nDr. Jenner was very fond of scribbling _currente calamo_ such verses\r\nas these. The following specimens of his literary prowess have, we\r\nbelieve, never before been published.\r\n\r\n                HANNAH BALL.--A SONG.\r\n\r\n    \"Farewell, ye dear lasses of town and of city,\r\n      Sweet ladies, adieu to you all!\r\n    Don't show a frown, though I tune up a ditty\r\n      In praise of fair Hannah Ball.\r\n\r\n    \"T'other eve, as I rambled her snug cottage by,\r\n      Sly Cupid determined my fall,\r\n    The rogue, 'stead of darts, shot the beams of her eye,\r\n      The eye of my fair Hannah Ball.\r\n\r\n    \"So sweetly she look'd, when attired so fine,\r\n      In her Dunstable hat and her shawl,\r\n    Enraptured I cried--''Tis a Goddess divine.'\r\n      'No indeed'--she replied--'Hannah Ball.'\r\n\r\n    \"The bosom of Delia, tho' whiter than snow,\r\n      Is no more than black velvet pall--\r\n    Compared with my Hannah's--I'd have you to know--\r\n      The bosom of fair Hannah Ball.\r\n\r\n    \"The honey the bee from her jessamine sips\r\n      You'd swear was as bitter as gall,\r\n    Could you taste but the sweets that exhale from the lips,\r\n      From the lips of the fair Hannah Ball.\r\n\r\n    \"What's rouge, or carmine, or the blush of the rose?\r\n      Why, dead as the lime on the wall,\r\n    Compared with the delicate colour that glows\r\n      On the cheek of my fair Hannah Ball.\r\n\r\n    \"When David melodiously play'd to appease\r\n      The troubled emotions of Saul,\r\n    Were his sounds more enchanting--ah, tell me, than these?\r\n      'Hannah Ball, oh! the fair Hannah Ball.'\r\n\r\n    \"Near yonder fair copse as I pensively rove\r\n      In an eve, when the dews 'gin to fall;\r\n    To my sighs how kind echo responds from the grove--\r\n      'Hannah Ball, oh! the fair Hannah Ball.'\r\n\r\n    \"With graces so winning see Rossi advance\r\n      But what's all his grace?--Why a sprawl--\r\n    With my Hannah compared, as she skims through the dance--\r\n      The lovely, the fair Hannah Ball.\r\n\r\n    \"The song of the Mara--tho' great is her skill,\r\n      Believe me's no more than a squall,\r\n    Compared with the rapturous magical trill\r\n      Of my charming, my fair Hannah Ball.\r\n\r\n    \"For oft in the meads at the close of the day,\r\n      Near yon murmuring rivulet's fall,\r\n    Have I heard the soft nightingale's soul-piercing lay,\r\n      And thought 'twas my fair Hannah Ball.\r\n\r\n    \"To her eyes in Love's language I've told a soft tale,\r\n      But, alas! they replied not at all;\r\n    Yet bashfulness oft will our passions conceal;\r\n      Oh! the modest, the fair Hannah Ball.\r\n\r\n    \"Ye Gods! would you make the dear creature my wife,\r\n      With thanks would I bow to you all;\r\n    How smoothly would then run the wheels of my life,\r\n      With my charming, my fair Hannah Ball.\r\n\r\n    \"But should my petition be flung from the skies,\r\n      I'll take the bare bodkin or awl;\r\n    Yes! the cold seal of Death shall be fix'd on my eyes,--\r\n      What's Life without fair Hannah Ball.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a happy little satire on a vilage scandal. The Methodist\r\nparson and Roger were amongst the doctor's rustic neighbours.\r\n\r\n     On a quarrel between Butler, the Methodist parson of\r\n     Frampton, and Roger his clerk. Butler accused the clerk of\r\n     stealing his liquors, and the clerk accused Butler of\r\n     stealing his bacon.\r\n\r\n    \"Quoth good parson Butler to Rogers his clerk,\r\n    'How things come to light that are done in the dark!\r\n    My wine is all pilfer'd,--a sad piece of work,--\r\n    But a word with thee, Richard--I see thou'rt no Turk.'\r\n\r\n    \"'What evil befall us!'--quoth Dick in reply,\r\n    Whilst contempt methodistical glanced from his eye,--\r\n    'My bacon's slipt off too--alas, sir! 'tis true,\r\n    And the fact seems to whisper that--you are no Jew.'\"\r\n\r\nThe most daring of Jenner's epigrams, out of the scores that we have\r\nperused, is the following--\r\n\r\n\r\n                    ON READING ADAM SMITH.\r\n\r\n    \"The priests may exclaim against cursing and swearing,\r\n    And tell us such things are quite beyond bearing;\r\n    But 'tis clear as the day their denouncing's a sham;\r\n    For a thousand good things may be learnt from _Adam_.\"\r\n\r\nBabbage, in his \"Decline of Science in England,\" has remarked that\r\n\"some of the most valuable names which adorn the history of English\r\nscience have been connected with this (the medical) profession.\" Of\r\nthose names many have belonged to country doctors; amongst which\r\nJenner has a conspicuous place.[22]\r\n\r\n  [22] Medical readers will be amused with the following letter, written\r\n  by Dr. Jenner, showing as it does the excess of caution with which he\r\n  prepared his patients for the trifling operation of vaccination.\r\n\r\n       \"Sir,\r\n\r\n       \"I was absent from home when your obliging letter of the\r\n       24th November arrived; but I do not think this is likely to\r\n       occur again for some time, and I shall therefore be very\r\n       happy to take your little family under my care at the time\r\n       you mention--the latter end of January. Our arrangements\r\n       must be carefully made, as the children must be met here by\r\n       proper subjects for transferring the Vaccine Lymph; for on\r\n       the accuracy of this part of the process much depends. It\r\n       may be necessary to observe also, that among the greatest\r\n       impediments to vaccination (indeed the greatest) is an\r\n       eruptive state of the skin on the child intended to receive\r\n       the infection. On this subject I wrote a paper so long ago\r\n       as the year 1804, and took much pains to circulate it; but I\r\n       am sorry to say the attention that has been paid to it by\r\n       the Faculty in general has been by no means equal to its\r\n       importance. This is a rock on which vaccination has been\r\n       often wreck'd; but there is no excuse, as it was so clearly\r\n       laid down in the chart.\r\n\r\n                            \"I am, Sir, your obedient\r\n                                     \"and very humble servant,\r\n                                                 \"EDWARD JENNER.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJenner was a bright representative of that class of medical\r\npractitioners--sagacious, well-instructed, courageous, and\r\nself-dependent in intellect--who, at the close of the last century,\r\nbegan to spring up in all parts of the country, and have rapidly\r\nincreased in number; so that now the prejudiced, vulgar, pedantic\r\ndoctors of Sterne's and Smollett's pages are extinct--no more to be\r\nfound on the face of the earth than are the drunken squires who\r\npatronized and insulted them.\r\n\r\nOf such a sort was Samuel Parr, the father of the famous classic\r\nscholar and Whig politician of the same name. The elder Parr was a\r\ngeneral practitioner at Harrow, \"a man\" (as his son described him) \"of\r\na very robust and vigorous intellect.\" Educated in his early years at\r\nHarrow School, Samuel Parr (the son) was taken from that splendid\r\nseminary at the age of fourteen years and apprenticed to his father.\r\nFor three or four years he applied himself to the mastery of the\r\nelements of surgical and medical knowledge--dispensing medicines,\r\nassisting at operations, and performing all the duties which a country\r\ndoctor's pupil was expected to perform. But he had not nerve enough\r\nfor the surgical department of the profession. \"For a physician,\" he\r\nused to say, \"I might have done well, but for a surgeon never.\" His\r\nfather consequently sent him to Cambridge, and allowed him to turn his\r\nintellects to those pursuits in which Nature had best fitted him to\r\nexcel. Dr. Parr's reminiscences of this period of medical instruction\r\nwere nearly all pleasant--and some of them were exquisitely droll. At\r\nthat early age his critical taste and faculty caused him to subject\r\nthe prescriptions that came under his notice to a more exact scrutiny\r\nthan the dog-Latin of physicians usually undergoes.\r\n\r\n\"Father,\" cried the boy, glancing his eye over a prescription, \"here's\r\nanother mistake in the grammar!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sam,\" answered the irritable sire, \"d---- the prescription, make up\r\nthe medicine.\"\r\n\r\nLaudanum was a preparation of opium just then coming into use. Mr.\r\nParr used it at first sparingly and cautiously. On one occasion he\r\nadministered a small quantity to a patient, and the next day, pleased\r\nwith the effects of the dose, expressed his intention (but\r\nhesitatingly) to repeat it.\r\n\r\n\"You may do that safely, sir,\" said the son.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be rash, boy. Beginners are always too bold. How should you\r\nknow what is safe?\" asked the father.\r\n\r\n\"Because, sir,\" was the answer, \"when I made up the prescription\r\nyesterday, I doubled the dose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Doubled the dose! How dared you do that?\" exclaimed the angry senior.\r\n\r\n\"Because, sir,\" answered little Sam, coolly, \"_I saw you hesitate._\"\r\n\r\nThe father who would not feel pride in such a son would not deserve to\r\nhave him.\r\n\r\nThough Parr made choice of another profession he always retained a\r\ndeep respect for his father's calling and the practitioners of it;\r\nmedical men forming a numerous and important portion of his\r\nacquaintance. In his years of ripest judgment he often declared that\r\n\"he considered the medical professors as the most learned,\r\nenlightened, moral, and liberal class of the community.\"\r\n\r\nHow many pleasant reminiscences this writer has of country surgeons--a\r\nclass of men interesting to an observer of manners, as they comprise\r\nmore distinct types of character than any other professional body.\r\nHail to thee, Dr. Agricola! more yeoman than _savant_, bluff, hearty,\r\nand benevolent, hastening away from fanciful patients to thy farm,\r\nabout which it is thy pleasure, early and late, to trudge, vigilant\r\nand canny, clad in velveteen jacket and leathern gaiters, armed with\r\nspud-stick or double-barrel gun, and looking as unlike Andrew Borde\r\nor Dr. Slop as it is possible to conceive mortal! What an eccentric,\r\npious, tyrannical, most humane giant thou art! When thou wast mayor of\r\nthy borough, what lawless law didst thou maintain! With thine own arm\r\nand oaken stick didst thou fustigate the drunken poacher who beat his\r\nwife; and the little children, who made a noise in the market-square\r\non a Sunday, thou didst incarcerate (for the sake of public morality)\r\nin \"the goose-house\" for two hours; but (for the sake of mercy) thou\r\ndidst cause to be served out to each prisoner one large gingerbread\r\nbun--to soften the hardships of captivity. When the ague raged, and\r\nprovisions were scarce in what the poor still refer to as \"the bad\r\nyear,\" what prescriptions didst thou, as parish doctor, shower down on\r\nthe fever-ridden?--Mutton and gin, beef and wine--such were thy\r\norders! The parsons said bravo! and clapt thee on the back; but the\r\nguardians of the poor and the relieving officers were up in arms, and\r\nsummoned thee before a solemn tribunal at the union-house--\"the\r\nboard!\" in fact. What an indignant oath and scream of ridicule didst\r\nthou give, when an attorney (Sir Oracle of \"the board\") endeavoured to\r\ninstil into thy mind the first principles of supply and demand, and\r\nthat grandest law of political economy--to wit, if there are too many\r\npoor people in a neighbourhood, they must be starved out of it into\r\none where they will not be in the way; and if there are too many poor\r\npeople in the entire world, they must be starved out of that also into\r\nanother, where there'll be more room for them! And what was thy answer\r\nto the chairman's remark, \"Doctor, if mutton and gin are the only\r\nmedicines that will cure the sick poor, you must supply them\r\nyourself, in accordance with your contract\"? What was thy answer? Why,\r\na shower of butchers' and vintners' bills, pulled from the pockets of\r\nthy ancient gray coat--bills all receipted, and showing that, before\r\nasking the ratepayers for a doit, thou hadst expended every penny of\r\nthy salary of £150 on mutton and gin, beef and wine--for the sick\r\npoor! What a noble answer to a petty taunt! The chairman blushed. The\r\nattorney hurried away, saying he had to be present at an auction. The\r\ngreat majority of \"the board\" came to a resolution, engaging to\r\nsupport you in your schemes for helping the poor through the bad year.\r\nBut the play was not yet at an end. Some rumours of what had occurred\r\nat the board reaching the ears of a few poor peasants, they made bold\r\nto thank thee for thy exertions in their behalf. How didst thou\r\nreceive them?--With a violent harrangue against their incorrigible\r\nlaziness and dishonesty--an assurance that half their sufferings\r\nsprung from their own vices--and a vehement declaration that, far from\r\nspeaking a good word for them to the guardians, thou didst counsel the\r\nsternest and cruellest of measures.\r\n\r\nA man of another mould and temper was the writer's dear friend, Felix.\r\nGentle and ardent, tranquil as a summer evening, and unyielding as a\r\nrock, modest but brave, unobtrusive but fearless, he had a mind that\r\npoets only could rightly read. Delicate in frame, as he was refined in\r\nintellect, he could not endure rude exertion or vulgar pleasure.\r\nActive in mind, he still possessed a vein of indolence, thoroughly\r\nappreciating the pleasure of dreaming the whole day long on a sunny\r\nchair in a garden, surrounded with bright flowers and breathing a\r\nperfumed air. In the hot season the country people used to watch their\r\ndoctor traversing the country in his capacious phaeton. Alone, without\r\na servant by his side, he held the reins in his hands, but in his\r\nreveries altogether forgot to use them. Sometimes he would fall\r\nasleep, and travel for miles in a state of unconsciousness, his great\r\nphlegmatic horse pounding the dust at the rate of five miles an hour.\r\nThe somni-driverous doctor never came to harm. His steed knew how to\r\nkeep on the left-hand side of the road, under ordinary circumstances\r\npassing all vehicles securely, but never thinking of overtaking any;\r\nand the country people, amongst whom the doctor spent his days, made\r\nhis preservation from bodily harm an object of their especial care.\r\nOften did a rustic wayfarer extricate the doctor's equipage from a\r\nperilous position, and then send it onwards without disturbing the\r\ngentleman by waking him. The same placid, equable man was Felix in\r\nsociety, that he was on these professional excursions--nothing\r\nalarming or exciting him. It was in his study that the livelier\r\nelements of his nature came into play. Those who, for the first time,\r\nconversed with him in private on his microscopic and chemical\r\npursuits, his researches in history, or his labours in speculative or\r\nnatural philosophy, caught fire from his fire and were inspired with\r\nhis enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nFelix belonged to a class daily becoming more numerous; Miles was of a\r\nspecies that has already become rare--the army surgeon. The\r\nnecessities of the long war caused the enrolment of numbers of young\r\nmen in the ranks of the medical profession, whose learning was not\r\ntheir highest recommendation to respect. An old navy surgeon, of no\r\nsmall wit, and an infinite capacity for the consumption of strong\r\nliquors--wine, brandy, whisky, usquebaugh (anything, so long as it was\r\nstrong)--gave a graphic description to this writer of his examination\r\non things pertaining to surgery by the Navy Board.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the narrator, putting down his empty glass and filling it\r\nagain with Madeira--\"I was shown into the examination-room. Large\r\ntable, and half-a-dozen old gentlemen at it. 'Big-wigs, no doubt,'\r\nthought I; 'and sure as my name is Symonds, they'll pluck me like a\r\npigeon.'\r\n\r\n\"'Well, sir, what do you know about the science of your profession?'\r\nasked the stout man in the chair.\r\n\r\n\"'More than he does of the practice, I'll be bound,' tittered a little\r\nwasp of a dandy--a West End ladies' doctor.\r\n\r\n\"I trembled in my shoes.\r\n\r\n\"'Well, sir,' continued the stout man, 'what would you do if a man was\r\nbrought to you during action with his arms and legs shot off? Now,\r\nsir, don't keep the Board waiting! What would you do? Make haste!'\r\n\r\n\"'By Jove, sir!' I answered--a thought just striking me--'I should\r\npitch him overboard, and go on to some one else I could be of more\r\nservice to.'\r\n\r\n\"By -- --! every one present burst out laughing; and they passed me\r\ndirectly, sir--passed me directly!\"\r\n\r\nThe examiners doubtless felt that a young man who could manifest such\r\npresence of mind on such an occasion, and so well reply to a\r\nterrorizing question, might be trusted to act wisely on other\r\nemergencies.\r\n\r\nMany stories of a similar kind are very old acquaintances of most of\r\nour readers.\r\n\r\n\"What\"--an examiner of the same Board is reported to have said to a\r\ncandidate--\"would you have recourse to if, after having ineffectually\r\ntried all the ordinary diaphoretics, you wanted to throw your patient,\r\nin as short a time as possible, into a profuse perspiration?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should send him here, sir, to be examined,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\nNot less happy was the audacity of the medical student to Abernethy.\r\n\r\n\"What would you do,\" bluntly inquired the surgeon, \"if a man was\r\nbrought to you with a broken leg?\"\r\n\r\n\"Set it, sir,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\n\"Good--very good--you're a very pleasant, witty young man; and\r\ndoubtless you can tell me what muscles of my body I should set in\r\nmotion if I kicked you, as you deserve to be kicked, for your\r\nimpertinence.\"\r\n\r\n\"You would set in motion,\" responded the youth, with perfect coolness,\r\n\"the flexors and extensors of my right arm; for I should immediately\r\nknock you down.\"\r\n\r\nIf the gentlemen so sent forth to kill and cure were not overstocked\r\nwith professional learning, they soon acquired a knowledge of their\r\nart in that best of all schools--experience. At the conclusion of the\r\ngreat war they were turned loose upon the country, and from their body\r\ncame many of the best and most successful practitioners of every\r\ncounty of the kingdom. The race is fast dying out. A Waterloo banquet\r\nof medical officers, serving in our army at that memorable battle,\r\nwould at the present time gather together only a small number of\r\nveterans. This writer can remember when they were plentiful; and, in\r\ncompany with two or three of the best of their class, he spent many of\r\nthe happiest days of his boyhood. An aroma of old camp life hung about\r\nthem. They rode better horses, and more boldly, than the other doctors\r\nround about. However respectable they might have become with increased\r\nyears and prosperity, they retained the military knack of making\r\nthemselves especially comfortable under any untoward combination of\r\nexternal circumstances. To gallop over a bleak heath, through the cold\r\nfog of a moonless December night; to sit for hours in a stifling\r\ngarret by a pauper's pallet; to go for ten days without sleeping on a\r\nbed, without undressing, and with the wear of sixteen hours out of\r\nevery twenty-four spent on horseback--were only features of \"duty,\"\r\nand therefore to be borne manfully, and with generous endurance, at\r\nthe time--and, in the retrospect, to be talked of with positive\r\ncontentment and hilarity. They loved the bottle, too--as it ought to\r\nbe loved: on fit occasions drinking any given quantity, and, in\r\nreturn, giving any quantity to drink; treating claret and the thinner\r\nwines with a levity at times savouring of disdain; but having a deep\r\nand unvarying affection for good sound port, and, at the later hours,\r\nvery hot and very strong whisky and water, _with_ a slice of lemon in\r\neach tumbler. How they would talk during their potations! What stories\r\nand songs! George the Fourth (even according to his own showing) had\r\nscarce more to do in bringing about the victory at Waterloo than\r\nthey. Lord Anglesey's leg must have been amputated thrice; for this\r\nwriter knew three surgeons who each--separately and by himself--performed\r\nthe operation. But this sort of boasting was never indulged in before\r\nthe --th tumbler.\r\n\r\nMay a word not be here said on the toping country doctor? Shame on\r\nthese times! ten years hence one will not be able to find a bibulous\r\napothecary, though search be made throughout the land from Dan to\r\nBeersheba! Sailors, amongst the many superstitions to which they cling\r\nwith tenacity, retain a decided preference for an inebrious to a sober\r\nsurgeon. Not many years since, in a fishing village on the eastern\r\ncoast, there flourished a doctor in great repute amongst the poor; and\r\nhis influence over his humble patients literally depended on the fact\r\nthat he was sure, once in the four-and-twenty hours, to be handsomely\r\nintoxicated. Charles Dickens has told the public how, when he bought\r\nthe raven immortalised in \"Barnaby Rudge,\" the vendor of that\r\nsagacious bird, after enumerating his various accomplishments and\r\nexcellences, concluded, \"But, sir, if you want him to come out very\r\nstrong, you must show him a drunk man.\" The simple villagers of\r\nFlintbeach had a firm faith in the strengthening effects of looking at\r\na tipsy doctor. They always postponed their visits to Dr. Mutchkin\r\ntill evening, because then they had the benefit of the learned man in\r\nhis highest intellectual condition. \"Dorn't goo to he i' the mornin',\r\ner can't doctor noways to speak on tills er's had a glass,\" was the\r\nadvice invariably given to a stranger not aware of the doctor's little\r\npeculiarities.\r\n\r\nMutchkin was unquestionably a shrewd fellow, although he did his best\r\nto darken the light with which nature had endowned him. One day,\r\naccompanied by his apprentice, he visited a small tenant farmer who\r\nhad been thrown on his bed with a smart attack of bilious fever. After\r\nlooking at his patient's tongue and feeling his pulse, he said\r\nsomewhat sharply:--\r\n\r\n\"Ah! 'tis no use doing what's right for you, if you will be so\r\nimprudent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Goodness, doctor, what do you mean?\" responded the sick man; \"I have\r\ndone nothing imprudent.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!--nothing imprudent? Why, bless me, man, you have had green peas\r\nfor dinner.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I have, sir. But how did you find that out?\"\r\n\r\n\"In your pulse--in your pulse. It was very foolish. Mind, you mayn't\r\ncommit such an indiscretion again. It might cost you your life.\"\r\n\r\nThe patient, of course, was impressed with Mutchkin's acuteness, and\r\nso was the apprentice. When the lad and his master had retired, the\r\nformer asked:--\r\n\r\n\"How did you know he had taken peas for dinner, sir? Of course it\r\nwasn't his pulse that told you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, boy,\" the instructor replied, \"I saw the pea-shells that had\r\nbeen thrown into the yard, and I drew my inference.\"\r\n\r\nThe hint was not thrown away on the youngster. A few days afterwards,\r\nbeing sent to call on the same case, he approached the sick man, and,\r\nlooking very observant, felt the pulse.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!--um--by Jove!\" exclaimed the lad, mimicking his master's manner,\r\n\"this is very imprudent. It may cost you your life. Why, man, you've\r\neaten a horse for your dinner.\"\r\n\r\nThe fever patient was so infuriated with what he naturally regarded as\r\nimpertinence, that he sent a pathetic statement of the insult offered\r\nhim to Mutchkin. On questioning his pupil as to what he meant by\r\naccusing a man, reduced with sickness, of having consumed so large and\r\ntough an animal, the doctor was answered--\r\n\r\n\"Why, sir, as I passed through from the yard I saw the saddle hanging\r\nup in the kitchen.\"\r\n\r\nThis story is a very ancient one. It may possibly be found in one of\r\nthe numerous editions of Joe Miller's facetiæ. The writer has,\r\nhowever, never met with it in print, and the first time he heard it,\r\nDr. Mutchkin, of Flintbeach, was made to figure in it in the matter\r\nabove described.\r\n\r\nThe shrewdness of Mutchkin's apprentice puts us in mind of the\r\nsagacity of the hydropathic doctor, mentioned in the \"Life of Mr\r\nAssheton Smith.\" A gentleman devoted to fox-hunting and deep potations\r\nwas induced, by the master of the Tedworth Hunt, to have recourse to\r\nthe water cure, and see if it would not relieve him of chronic gout,\r\nand restore something of the freshness of youth. The invalid acted on\r\nthe advice, and in obedience to the directions of a hydropathic\r\nphysician, proceeded to swathe his body, upon going to his nightly\r\nrest, with wet bandages. The air was chill, and the water\r\nlooked--very--cold. The patient shivered as his valet puddled the\r\nbandages about in the cold element. He paused, as a schoolboy does,\r\nbefore taking his first \"header\" for the year on a keen May morning;\r\nand during the pause much of his noble resolve oozed away.\r\n\r\n\"John,\" at last he said to his valet, \"put into that d---- water half\r\na dozen bottles of port wine, to warm it.\"\r\n\r\nJohn having carried out the direction, the bandages, saturated with\r\nport wine and water, were placed round the corpulent trunk of the\r\ninvalid. The next morning the doctor, on paying his visit and\r\ninspecting the linen swathes, instead of expressing astonishment at\r\ntheir discoloration with the juice of the grape, observed, with the\r\nutmost gravity:--\r\n\r\n\"Ah, the system is acting beautifully. See, the port wine is already\r\nbeginning to leave you!\"\r\n\r\nA different man from Dr. Mutchkin was jovial Ambrose Harvey. Twenty\r\nyears ago no doctor throughout his county was more successful--no man\r\nmore beloved. By natural strength of character he gained leave from\r\nsociety to follow his own humours without let, hindrance, or censure.\r\nLadies did not think the less highly of his professional skill because\r\nhe visited them in pink, and left their bedsides to ride across the\r\ncountry with Lord Cheveley's hounds. Six feet high, handsome, hearty,\r\nwell-bred, Ambrose had a welcome wherever there was joy or sickness.\r\nTo his little wife he was devotedly attached and very considerate; and\r\nshe in return was very fond, and--what with woman is the same\r\nthing--very jealous of him. He was liked, she well knew, by the\r\ncountry ladies, many of whom were so far her superiors in rank and\r\nbeauty and accomplishments, that it was only natural in the good\r\nlittle soul to entertain now and then a suspicious curiosity about the\r\nmovements of her husband. Was it nothing but the delicate health of\r\nLady Ellin that took him so frequently to Hove Hall? How it came\r\nabout, from what charitable whisperings on the part of kind friends,\r\nfrom what workings of original sin in her own gentle breast, it would\r\nbe hard to say; but 'tis a fact that, when Hove Hall was mentioned, a\r\nquick pain seized the little wife's heart and colour left her cheek,\r\nto return again quickly, and in increased quantity. The time came when\r\nshe discovered the groundlessness of her fears, and was deeply\r\nthankful that she had never, in any unguarded moment, by clouded brow,\r\nor foolish tears, or sharp reply, revealed the folly of her heart.\r\nJust at the time that Mrs. Ambrose was in the midst of this trial of\r\nher affection, Ambrose obtained her permission to drive over to a town\r\ntwelve miles distant, to attend the hunt dinner. The night of that\r\ndinner was a memorable one with the doctor's wife. Ambrose had\r\npromised to be home at eleven o'clock. But twelve had struck, and here\r\nhe had not returned. One o'clock--two o'clock! No husband! The\r\nservants had been sent to bed four hours ago; and Mrs. Ambrose sate\r\nalone in her old wainscotted parlour, with a lamp by her side, sad,\r\nand pale, and feverish--as wakeful as the house-dog out of doors, that\r\nroamed round the house, barking out his dissatisfaction at the\r\nprolonged absence of his master.\r\n\r\nAt length, at half-past two, a sound of wheels was at the door, and in\r\nanother minute Ambrose entered the hall, and greeted his little wife.\r\nAh, Mrs. Ellis, this writer will not pain you by entering into details\r\nin this part of his story. In defence of Ambrose, let it be said that\r\nit was the only time in all his married life that he paid too\r\nenthusiastic homage to the god of wine. Something he mumbled about\r\nbeing tired, and having a headache, and then he walked, not\r\nover-steadily, upstairs. Poor Mrs. Ambrose! It was not any good asking\r\n_him_, what had kept him out so late. Incensed, frightened, and\r\njealous, the poor little lady could not rest. She must have one doubt\r\nresolved. Where had her husband been all this time? Had he been round\r\nby Hove Hall? Had she reflected, she would have seen his Bacchic\r\ndrowsiness was the best possible evidence that he had not come from a\r\nlady's drawing-room. But jealousy is love's blindness. A thought\r\nseized the little woman's head; she heard the step of Ambrose's man in\r\nthe kitchen, about to retire to rest. Ah, he could tell her. A word\r\nfrom him would put all things right. Quick as thought, without\r\nconsidering her own or her husband's dignity, the angry little wife\r\nhastened down-stairs, and entered the kitchen where John was paying\r\nhis respects to some supper and mild ale that had been left out for\r\nhim. As evil fortune would have it, the step she had taken to mend\r\nmatters made them worse.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, John,\" said the lady, telling a harmless fib, \"I have just come\r\nto see if cook left you out a good supper.\"\r\n\r\nJohn--most civil and trustworthy of grooms--rose, and posing himself\r\non his heels, made a respectful obeisance to his mistress, not a\r\nlittle surprised at her anxiety for his comfort. But, alas! the\r\npotations at the hunt-dinner had not been confined to the gentlemen of\r\nthe hunt. John had, in strong ale, taken as deep draughts of gladness\r\nas Ambrose had in wine. At a glance his mistress saw the state of the\r\ncase, and in her fright, losing all caution, put her question\r\npoint-blank, and with imperious displeasure--\"John, where have you and\r\nyour master been?--tell me instantly.\"\r\n\r\nAn admirable servant--honest and well-intentioned at all times--just\r\nthen confused and loquacious--John remembered him how often his master\r\nhad impressed upon him that it was his duty not to gossip about the\r\nplaces he stopped at in his rounds, as professional secrecy was a\r\nvirtue scarcely less necessary in a doctor's man-servant than in a\r\ndoctor. Acting on a muddle-headed reminiscence of his instructions,\r\nJohn reeled towards his mistress, endeavouring to pacify her with a\r\nprofusion of duteous bobbings of the head, and in a tone of piteous\r\nsympathy, and with much incoherence, made this memorable answer to her\r\nquestion: \"I'm very sorry, mum, and I do hope, mum, you won't be\r\nangry. I allus wish to do you my best duty--that I do, mum--and you're\r\na most good, affable missus, and I, and cook, and all on us are very\r\ngrateful to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind that. Where have you and your master been? That's my\r\nquestion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, mum--I darnatellye, it would bes goodasmeplace wi' master. I\r\ndare not say where we ha' been. For master rekwested me patikler not\r\nto dewulge.\"\r\n\r\nBut thou hadst not wronged thy wife. It was not thine to hurt any\r\nliving thing, dear friend. All who knew thee will bear witness that to\r\nthee, and such as thee, Crabbe pointed not his bitter lines:--\r\n\r\n    \"But soon a loud and hasty summons calls,\r\n    Shakes the thin roof, and echoes round the walls;\r\n    Anon a figure enters, quaintly neat,\r\n    All pride and business, bustle and conceit,\r\n    With looks unalter'd by these scenes of woe,\r\n    With speed that entering speaks his haste to go;\r\n    He bids the gazing throng around him fly,\r\n    And carries Fate and Physic in his eye;\r\n    A potent quack, long versed in human ills,\r\n    Who first insults the victim whom he kills,\r\n    Whose murd'rous hand a drowsy bench protect,\r\n    And whose most tender mercy is neglect.\r\n    Paid by the Parish for attendance here,\r\n    He wears contempt upon his sapient sneer.\r\n    In haste he seeks the bed where misery lies,\r\n    Impatience mark'd in his averted eyes;\r\n    And, some habitual queries hurried o'er,\r\n    Without reply, he rushes to the door;\r\n    His drooping patient, long inured to pain,\r\n    And long unheeded, knows remonstrance vain;\r\n    He ceases now the feeble help to crave\r\n    Of man, and mutely hastens to the grave.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Abernethy, Dr. John, 48, 158, 159, 180, 213, 214, 216, 375, 407.\r\n\r\n  Abernethy, Biscuit, 162.\r\n\r\n  Addington, Dr. Anthony, 394.\r\n\r\n  Agricola, Dr., 496.\r\n\r\n  Agrippa, Cornelius, 87.\r\n\r\n  Aikin, Dr., 48, 428.\r\n\r\n  Ailhaud's Powder, 102.\r\n\r\n  Akenside, Dr., 327, 381.\r\n\r\n  Albemarle, Duke of, 54, 118.\r\n\r\n  Alexander, William, 320.\r\n\r\n  Allan, 43.\r\n\r\n  Alston, Sir Richard, 257.\r\n\r\n  Alured, Thomas, 274.\r\n\r\n  Andrew, Merry, 29, 422.\r\n\r\n  Anne, Queen, 92, 93, 94, 116, 117, 119, 131, 163, 189, 242, 262.\r\n\r\n  Anthony, Dr. Francis, 467.\r\n\r\n  Antiochus, 168.\r\n\r\n  Arbuthnot, Dr., 62, 72, 132, 138, 144, 163, 186, 187, 190, 191, 192.\r\n\r\n  Archer, Dr. John, 148, 149, 150, 225.\r\n\r\n  Argent, Dr., 17.\r\n\r\n  Armstrong, Dr., 426.\r\n\r\n  Arnold, Dr., 345.\r\n\r\n  Askew, Dr., 10, 244.\r\n\r\n  Atkins, Dr. Henry, 66, 204.\r\n\r\n  Atkins, Will, 15.\r\n\r\n  Aubrey, John, 25, 464.\r\n\r\n  Augustus, 13, 168.\r\n\r\n  Ayliffe, Sir John, 165, 166.\r\n\r\n  Ayre, William, 74.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Bacon, Lord, 82, 255, 287.\r\n\r\n  Baillie, Dr., 10, 244, 394.\r\n\r\n  Baker, Dr., 161, 332.\r\n\r\n  Ballow, Mr., 381.\r\n\r\n  Baltrop, Dr. Robert, 29.\r\n\r\n  Bancroft, Dr. John, 139.\r\n\r\n  Barber--surgeons, 12.\r\n\r\n  Baring, Sir F., 178.\r\n\r\n  Barrowby, Dr., 155, 156.\r\n\r\n  Barrymore, Lord, 154.\r\n\r\n  Bartley, Dr., 29.\r\n\r\n  Barton, Mr. 278.\r\n\r\n  Bayle, Dr., 78.\r\n\r\n  Beauclerc, Lady Vere, 289.\r\n\r\n  Beauford, Dr., 154, 155.\r\n\r\n  Beauford, Thomas, 474.\r\n\r\n  Beckford, 45.\r\n\r\n  Beddoes, Dr. 146.\r\n\r\n  Bedford, Duke of, 96, 309.\r\n\r\n  Behn, Afra, 200.\r\n\r\n  Bennet, Dr., 382.\r\n\r\n  Bentham, Jeremy, 397.\r\n\r\n  Bentley, 184, 185, 252.\r\n\r\n  Berkeley, Bishop, 96.\r\n\r\n  Berry, Miss, 318.\r\n\r\n  Betterton, 139.\r\n\r\n  Bickersteth, Dr. Henry, 396.\r\n\r\n  Bidloe, Dr., 118.\r\n\r\n  Blackmore, Sir Richard, 39, 51, 73, 74, 113, 115, 117, 186,\r\n        193, 375, 427.\r\n\r\n  Bleeding, 225.\r\n\r\n  Blizard, Sir William, 114, 245.\r\n\r\n  Blood, Mrs., 309.\r\n\r\n  Blount, Col., 195.\r\n\r\n  Bohn, Mr., 26.\r\n\r\n  Bond, John, M.
