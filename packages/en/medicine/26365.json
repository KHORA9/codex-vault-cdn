Certain peculiarities of form and\r\nconsiderable repetition of statement--both of which the reader cannot\r\nfail to notice--are owing to the fact that about two-thirds of the\r\nchapters were written under the caption \"Auto-genetic Poisons in\r\nthe Intestinal Canal and their Auto-infection.\" In revising these\r\ncontributions for book form I have given to each chapter a caption of\r\nits leading thought; but I am convinced that repetition of some of\r\nthe matters treated, especially if the repetition be in a somewhat\r\ndifferent connection, is not such a very bad thing. I have used my blue\r\npencil sparingly, and as a consequence the consecutive reader will find\r\nthat constipation, diarrhea, biliousness, indigestion, auto-infection\r\nand proctitis are treated in nearly all the chapters--but with varying\r\napplications. Therefore anyone suffering from one of these complaints\r\nwould better read the whole book instead of only the chapter with the\r\ncorresponding title.\r\n\r\nThese pages were written for intelligent laymen by a specialist, during\r\na busy, assiduous practice. I take such radical ground, however, going\r\nto the very root of the matter, that the general practitioner will do\r\nwell to give my thesis his careful consideration; he should at least\r\nglance at the following Introduction for the gist of my claim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.

Hardly a civilized man escapes proctitis from the day of\r\nthe diaper to that of death. The diaper is in truth chiefly responsible\r\nfor proctitis, and proctitis is in turn chiefly responsible for chronic\r\nconstipation, chronic diarrhea, auto-infection; and hence for\r\nmal-assimilation, mal-nutrition, anemia; and for a thousand and one\r\nreflex functional derangements of the system as well. The inflamed\r\nsurface of the intestinal canal (proctitis) inhibits the passage of\r\nfeces. Absorbent glands begin to act on the retained sewage, and the\r\nwhole system becomes more or less infected with poisonous bacteria.\r\nVarious organs (especially the feeblest) endeavor to perform vicarious\r\ndefecation, and the patient, the friends, and even the physician are\r\ndeceived by such vicarious performance into thinking and treating it as\r\na local ailment. I cannot, accordingly, insist too emphatically that\r\nproctitis, the exciting cause, must be treated primarily if we would\r\ncure chronic constipation. Millions of human beings are sent to\r\nuntimely graves by these ailments. Indeed, the body of nearly every\r\nhuman being is a pest-house of absorbed poison instead of being the\r\nworthy temple of a wondrous soul. All due to Proctitis!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTESTINAL ILLS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nMAN, COMPOSED ALMOST WHOLLY OF WATER, IS CONSTIPATED. WHY?\r\n\r\n\r\nNaturally the mind of man was first educated to observe external\r\nobjects and forces in their effects upon himself, and the external\r\nstill continues to engross his attention as if he were a child in a\r\nkindergarten. Fascinated by the Without, he ignores the Within. But,\r\nmarvel of marvels, Disease (which when looked at with discerning eyes\r\nis seen to be an angel in disguise) comes to enlighten him concerning\r\nthe world within. Disease gradually acquaints him with the fact that\r\nthere are within him organs and functions corresponding to the objects\r\nand forces in the world without,--servitors in fact which must not be\r\nignored under penalty of transforming them into foes to his well-being.\r\nDisease makes him aware that by ignoring the claims of his inner\r\nrelations he has been converting his very food, juices and gases into\r\ninsidious and formidable poisons, which perforce he absorbs into his\r\nblood and tissues and circulates throughout his entire system. Thus\r\ndoes the disguised angel admonish the ignorant that the rights of the\r\ninner world must not be ignored--that one's duties thereto cannot be\r\nneglected without disastrous consequences.\r\n\r\nThus does Pathology, which is really Physiology reversed, become the\r\nself-revealer _par excellence_. Through digestion and assimilation the\r\nphysiological process takes up the food, juices and gases, to support\r\nand augment the life of man. The pathological process, on the contrary,\r\nbecause the conditions for nutrition are ignored, reverses the\r\nupbuilding processes; and the organs of life wither, waste and weaken,\r\nuntil life goes out like fire unfed.\r\n\r\nMan has been slowly learning to take sanitary measures in reference to\r\neverything that contributes to comfort in his surroundings, and\r\nhygienic measures in reference to everything conducive to stability in\r\nhis health.\r\n\r\nThrough ages he has learned, by experience and experiment, of the\r\nchanges that inevitably occur in such perishable nutritive substances\r\nas water, milk, meats, vegetables, fruits, etc., if they be left\r\nuncared for; and he has been led thus to the inference of the law of\r\ndecomposition--or putrefactive and fermentative changes. Idle\r\nsubstances, like idle minds, have decomposition and the devil for\r\ncompanions. Substances confined in containers open to the air--ponds,\r\ncesspools, etc.--are every-day object lessons to man of the fact that\r\nthe chemical changes they undergo furnish the conditions for breeding\r\nbacterial poisons, and that these poisons are a dread menace to animal\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nIf the reader will observe the analogy between the decomposition of\r\nsubstances in vessels or pools, and the decomposition of food in the\r\nreservoir called the stomach; and its further decomposition in a long\r\ncanal (the small intestine), connecting the stomach with other\r\nreceptacles called the colon and sigmoid flexure; and then the\r\ndecomposition of _their_ contents; he will readily comprehend the\r\nchemical putrefactive or fermentative changes or bacterial action that\r\ntake place in the organism, if for any reason the contents be confined.\r\n\r\nOf the four chief elements that enter into the composition of living\r\nbodies three are gaseous, or convertible into gas. In the physical man\r\nwater constitutes three-fourths of the weight of the body. This being\r\nso we realize why, notwithstanding our sense of solidity and weight,\r\nchemical changes occur quite as readily in our organism as in the\r\nsubstances we see about us. There are no waterproof walls in the body\r\nof man to impede the percolation of liquids freighted with promiscuous\r\nPassengers from the alimentary canal; Passengers designed to nourish\r\nthe organs for which they have an affinity. But there are those that\r\nhave no organic affinity, and these are tramps, vagabonds, and even\r\nmurderers, disturbing and destroying the normal functions of the\r\nsystem. Through extravasation, that is, through fluid infiltration of\r\ntissues, these Passengers come to be one with us, and we make them part\r\nof our tissue; but some of the Passengers are the demolishers of the\r\nliving temple.\r\n\r\nWater is universally present in all the tissues of the body, and it is\r\nindispensable for introducing new substances into the system and for\r\neliminating the worn-out tissues and foreign substances. It is indeed\r\nimportant to emphasize the fact that properly to eliminate the foreign\r\nand waste products from the system requires, in a healthy person, at\r\nleast five pints of water during twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nThe amount of gastric juice secreted in twenty-four hours is from six\r\nto fourteen pints; of pancreatic juice, one pint; of bile there are two\r\nto three pints, and of saliva one to three pints. It is estimated that\r\nthe juices secreted during digestion in a man weighing 140 pounds\r\namount to twenty-three pounds in twenty-four hours. These fluids are\r\npoured back and forth in the process of transforming food into flesh\r\nand eliminating waste material.\r\n\r\nIn the alimentary canal there are vessels for holding fluid, semi-fluid\r\nand moist masses of substance, in all of which decomposition occurs if\r\nthe substances be retained beyond the normal length of time. These\r\nvessels or reservoirs are the stomach, duodenum, small intestines,\r\ncolon, sigmoid flexure, and too often the rectum. Through the\r\nharmonious action of this intestinal retinue of servitors man is well\r\nequipped and qualified for health, and he in whom this harmonious\r\nsubservience prevails is among the blessed and elect of mankind. But\r\nalas! the great majority of human beings are sufferers from the\r\ninharmonious and insubordinate action of these servitors. How many a\r\nhuman being suffers from _chronic constipation and indigestion_, the\r\nexciting causes of which are insidious, and the consequences a protean\r\nenemy to his happiness! Medical writers on the subject of chronic\r\nconstipation have assigned numerous causes, and likewise prescribed\r\nmultitudinous remedies to the patient; but as a general rule this\r\npatient, after suffering various woes, if still surviving the many\r\nyears of medication, rebels against taking further remedies and resigns\r\nhimself to the chronic enemy on the best terms he can make with diet.\r\n\r\nFor this large class of chronic sufferers we have good news; and for\r\nthe class that have suffered five or ten years we have better news; and\r\nfor the class of infants and children that have started on the road of\r\nill-health we have real glad tidings. To know that there is only one\r\nchief cause for chronic constipation and its train of disorders, and\r\nthat that cause overshadows all other causes combined, and is easily\r\ndiagnosed and treated, is news long hoped and prayed for by a multitude\r\nof sufferers the world over.\r\n\r\nTwenty years as a specialist in diseases of the lower bowels have\r\ndemonstrated to the writer that chronic inflammation, and often\r\nulceration, of the rectum and sigmoid flexure, in ninety-nine cases out\r\nof a hundred, is the cause of chronic constipation and the long army of\r\nills resulting from it. And yet, as the reader is well aware,\r\nconstipation has had many \"causes,\" since the days of Hippocrates,\r\nespecially the abnormal condition of the liver.\r\n\r\nThe etiology, that is, the exciting cause, of the inflammation of the\r\nanus, rectum, colon, etc., may date from the time a diaper was placed\r\non the new-born infant. Excoriations of the integument about the anus\r\nby the excretions of bowels and bladder indicate that the mucous\r\nmembrane of anus and rectum demands local remedies, as well as the\r\nintegument of the buttocks, and that it is not the liver which is at\r\nfault. The many applications of the diaper during the period of its\r\nuse, and the frequently delayed removal at night or during long rides\r\nin baby wagons, railway trains or carriages, and during long social\r\nvisits of the nurse; constipating foods, lack of drinking water,\r\nconstipating medicines, followed by all sorts of purgatives, etc., are\r\namong a few of the direct causes of diseases of the rectum. A child at\r\nthe age of eighteen months with a healthy rectum is most rare.\r\n\r\nThe ten thousand and one chances for contracting disease of the anus\r\nand rectum do not cease with the period of infancy. The child is left\r\npretty much to shift for itself as to regularity of eating and the\r\nevacuation of the contents of its bowels, wherein disease has already\r\nobtained a foothold. All kinds of foodstuffs, at all hours, with seeds,\r\nstones, etc., are poked into its stomach, followed by constipating\r\nremedies to quiet inevitable troubles, or brisk purgatives given with\r\nthe hope of expelling the arrested contents of the bowels. Is it any\r\nwonder that ninety-eight persons of adult age out of every hundred\r\nsuffer more or less from chronic inflammation and ulceration of anus,\r\nrectum, sigmoid flexure, colon, or appendix?\r\n\r\nTraumatic (externally produced) injuries to the mucous membrane of the\r\nrectum frequently cause inflammation, and hard pieces of bone, wood,\r\nseeds, imbedded in the feces, scratch, cut and bruise the tissues\r\nbefore and during the act of defecation. Cold boards, stones, earth and\r\nother substances used as seats may produce inflammation of the rectum.\r\nThere are many and various causes which may be the means of exciting\r\ninflammation of the anus and rectum later in life; but it is the\r\nwriter's opinion that the cause can be traced back to infancy or early\r\nchildhood, and that accidents or imprudence in after years merely\r\nexcite an already-existing chronic inflammation. Piles, fissure,\r\nitching pockets, tabs, prolapse, abscesses, fistulæ, etc., are only the\r\noutcome and symptoms of a chronic disease which has incubated for\r\nfifteen, twenty or more years. None of this list of troubles produces\r\nconstipation. It is the inflammation located at the middle portion of\r\nthe rectum and extending into the sigmoid flexure that causes\r\nconstipation; that protean monster which deranges more lives with\r\nnervousness than any other pathological condition to which the flesh of\r\nman is heir!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE PHYSICS OF DIGESTION AND EGESTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nA tree is simply an extension from its roots; and, in an analogous\r\nmanner, man's body may be said to be an extension from the alimentary\r\ncanal. Does it not follow, consequently, that the digestive apparatus,\r\nfrom a physiological point of view, is the most important organ of the\r\nhuman body? It must be prime and paramount because all other organs\r\ndepend upon it: it provides them with nourishment for preservation and\r\nimprovement, and it punishes them--if they do not mind the laws of\r\nnormality--by withholding its gifts, or by presenting these gifts in\r\nthe form of poisons that impoverish, hinder and degenerate the system\r\nof organs. Uncleanliness is surely one of the chief ways in which\r\nphysiological thoughtlessness is exhibited, and due punishment will\r\ninevitably follow disobedience.\r\n\r\nFoodstuffs are prepared for assimilation in the alimentary laboratory\r\nthrough the process of normal fermentation. Is it not essential,\r\ntherefore, that the connecting canals and receptacles be cleansed of\r\nthe fermented debris that may remain unused and unexpelled, before more\r\nfood be taken by the digestive apparatus? The all-important question\r\nis:--How soon and how well have the residuary part of the food (for\r\nsome part will always be undigested or unassimilated), and the waste\r\nresulting from worn-out tissues of the various organs, been eliminated\r\nfrom the system? Wisdom declares that it is not so much what we eat,\r\nbut what and how well we eliminate, that decides the issues of health\r\nand disease. Do the egesta pass out in the form of normal feces? Three\r\ntimes in twenty-four hours foodstuffs are taken, and as many times the\r\nbowels should be freed of accumulated excrement and gases. Does Nature\r\nhave her way, or do neglect and bad habits rule the assimilative and\r\neliminative functions of the bowels?\r\n\r\nThe habit of storing feces for twenty-four hours ought to concur and\r\nkeep pace with a habit of eating one meal in the same period. Household\r\nand laboratory receptacles in which fermentation has occurred are\r\nemptied and cleaned before fresh material is put into them. Is not the\r\nsame precaution more essential with the receptacles for digestion and\r\negestion? They constitute our chief physiological economy; they are\r\nprecious household and laboratory utensils; exceedingly precious, as we\r\ncan purchase no other set when these are worn and wasted beyond repair.\r\nWhat marvelous possessions, and how reckless most of us are with them!\r\nNeither love nor money will bring another \"body\"-house to us when this\r\ndecays; when poisons or parasites infest it as the result of a\r\npernicious diathesis, of debasing, destructive tendencies; in short, of\r\nunmindfulness!\r\n\r\nToo often criminal negligence or the lack of proper convenience has\r\nbrought on the habit of using the intestinal canal as a storehouse for\r\ndried feces, and the glands and blood-vessels as reservoirs for the\r\nabsorbed fluid poisons from the feces that have been stored and thus\r\ndried. This baneful habit is general throughout civilized communities.\r\nIt is this habit that has made the words \"constipation,\" \"indigestion,\"\r\n\"diarrhea,\" etc., familiar and household subjects of complaint. Medical\r\nwriters agree that \"constipation\" is the most common malady that\r\nafflicts mankind; but they are also unanimous in preposterously\r\nattributing the cause to the abnormal action of the liver and the\r\nsecondary symptoms of constipation.\r\n\r\nChronic constipation is the result of proctitis and colitis. Proctitis,\r\nthe inflammation of the rectal and anal canals, is the most common\r\ndisease that afflicts the human creature from infancy to old age; and\r\ncolitis is only the extension of proctitis to the colon.\r\n\r\nThe scientific diagnosis of constipation predicates proctitis and\r\nsometimes colitis. It is declared that constipation is its primary\r\nsymptom; and that diarrhea is one of its secondary symptoms, resulting\r\nfrom constipation. There is a legion of secondary symptoms of\r\nproctitis, all of which medical empiricism considers and denominates\r\ncauses. As constipation is such an every-day complaint of almost\r\neverybody one meets, it will not tax our imagination unduly to conceive\r\nhow it may be a frequent cause of diarrhea, which is only Nature's\r\neffort to get rid of its useless and excessive burden of retained feces\r\nand gases. Constipation, semi-constipation, and irregular action of the\r\nbowels, excessive fermentation, putrefaction, self-generated or\r\nauto-infection, are the factors to be considered. It is to be noted\r\nthat in many cases diarrhea is simply an increased peristalsis of the\r\nbowels, often due to local and diffused irritation and often to\r\ninflammation of the mucous membrane (not infrequently with ulceration);\r\nall of these may be the outcome of fecal impaction.\r\n\r\nTo make intelligible the physics of the digestive and egestive\r\nprocesses, we must understand the apparatus. One would naturally think\r\nthat were the bends or curves of the large intestine undone, it would\r\nbe found to be a long, straight, smooth canal or bore like a rubber\r\ntube. But such is not the case. The outer muscular longitudinal bands\r\nare much shorter than the musculo-areolo-mucous tube, an arrangement\r\nwhich brings about a transverse puckering of the gut and mucous\r\nmembrane, thus forming valves, folds, sacs or pouches at short\r\nintervals along the canal. These transverse folds or valves inhibit the\r\ntoo hasty passage of the feces along the bowels by checking and\r\nretaining the egested product in the large recesses or pools between\r\nthe folds; they thus serve as so many dams in the passage of feces\r\ntoward elimination. This wise provision of Nature to moderate the\r\nsteady motion of the feces as they proceed toward the sigmoid flexure\r\nor receptacle, to wait there till there is a proper stimulus for\r\nexpulsion, is wofully abused by man. He is quite willing to take\r\nfoodstuffs three or four times a day, to fill the long row of\r\nintestinal pools between the dams with feces and gases in all stages of\r\ndecomposition, not dreaming of the danger from developing bacteria and\r\ntheir absorption into the system.\r\n\r\nReally he is inclined to eat at all times, yet begrudges a few minutes\r\nspent in a hurried effort to perform the act of defecation once in\r\ntwenty-four hours. Some of us even have our minds absorbed in reading\r\nwhile awaiting an \"automatic action\" of the bowels. What a contrast\r\nbetween the gusto and time spent in taking foodstuffs and the\r\nindifference and indolence regarding the action of the bowels, unless\r\nindeed severe biliousness or diarrhea reminds us strongly of our sewer\r\nof waste products.\r\n\r\nAn attack of acute or chronic diarrhea is the penalty some pay for long\r\ninattention to the demands nature makes for intestinal cleanliness\r\nthree times in twenty-four hours. Constipated people, semi-constipated\r\npeople, irregular people and twenty-four-hour people, are not healthy.\r\nThey are constantly being poisoned by the abnormal products of\r\nindigestion and putrefaction resulting from fecal stagnation, which\r\nproducts enter the blood and circulate through every tissue of the\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nAll cases of proctitis are more or less accompanied by constipation and\r\ndiarrhea. In all cases of chronic constipation I have found proctitis,\r\nand often colitis, and am forced to believe it is the most common and\r\nproximate cause of chronic constipation of the bowels. Constipation\r\nbeing a primary symptom, there must of necessity follow numerous\r\nsecondary symptoms, of which diarrhea well marks the progress of septic\r\ninfection. Some of the symptoms of infection are headache, megrim,\r\nvertigo, dyspepsia, foul tongue and mouth, back-aches, stiff neck,\r\ngnawing pain or numb feeling at the lower end of the spine,\r\nbiliousness, bad odor from breath and skin, muddy complexion, cold\r\nhands and feet, jaundice, neurasthenia, loss of memory, drowsy feeling,\r\npernicious anemia, emaciation, flabby obesity with pallor, capricious\r\nappetite, fits of great mental depression, palpitation of the heart,\r\nbloating of the stomach and bowels, disturbance of the kidneys, liver,\r\nlungs and mucous membrane in general, and especially chronic rhinitis\r\nand pharyngitis, which latter are among the first symptoms of imperfect\r\nalimentary excretion.\r\n\r\nAs auto-intoxication (that condition of the system when it is\r\ncontinually poisoned, usually by one's own excretions) gains the\r\nmastery of the vital forces at any period of life, the mucous membranes\r\nare likely to be first affected by inflammation of catarrhal character;\r\nthen the serous membranes of the body. Mal-assimilation, mal-nutrition,\r\ncell-atrophy, are symptoms of the giving way of the vital energies to\r\nthe invasion of the filth and bacterial poisons absorbed from the\r\nintestinal canal.\r\n\r\nOn the inner surface of the alimentary canal, from the stomach to the\r\ncolon, there are, it is estimated, over 20,000,000 rootlets (called\r\nglands, lacteals, follicles, villi), which take up intestinal juices as\r\nroots of a plant take sap from the soil. These millions of rootlets\r\ngive a velvety appearance to the alimentary canal, like a nap or downy\r\nsurface. Intestinal rootlets of the small intestines, like vegetal\r\nrootlets, demand a certain amount of normal fluid and solid substance,\r\nfree from noxious gas. It is the down or nap of fabrics, and not their\r\nbody, that shows damage first. So it is with the frail structure of\r\nvegetal and animal life if not properly supplied with nourishment from\r\nday to day. There is probably in the vegetal bodies a continuous\r\ncirculation of sap corresponding to the digestive circulating fluids of\r\nthe alimentary canal. This circulation from the alimentary canal to the\r\nblood-vessels, and from the blood-vessels to the alimentary canal,\r\ninvolves a wonderful mechanism, facilitating the flow of several\r\ngallons daily from each to the other during the process of\r\nmetamorphosis of food into flesh. You can thus see how inevitable it is\r\nthat the functions of these millions of secreting and excreting\r\nrootlets will be disturbed by the clogging of the system with filth and\r\nbacterial poisons as a consequence of chronic constipation, biliousness\r\nand general foulness of the alimentary canal. Through such disturbance\r\nnutrition is diminished, cell-atrophy progresses, and emaciation\r\nbecomes more marked. The progressive destruction of these rootlets,\r\ninvolving the pathological change indicated, will be manifest in one of\r\nits results, either costiveness or diarrhea.\r\n\r\nOften the power of properly digesting and absorbing the foodstuffs is\r\nso greatly diminished that the alimentary canal is about as useless as\r\na soft rubber tube. Millions on millions of these glands, lacteals and\r\nfollicles in the stomach and small intestines, are destroyed like the\r\nrootlets of a plant or tree in unwholesome soil. The active circulation\r\nof the digestive fluids ceases, and the sufferer is said to be costive\r\nor to have chronic diarrhea. Both symptoms are the outgrowth of many\r\nyears of intestinal foulness, and indicate the degree and character of\r\nintestinal irritability and semi-starvation of the body, as a\r\nconsequence of either the absorption of poisons or the excessive\r\nelimination of the vital substance of the body through diarrhea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE INTER-DEPENDENCE OF ANUS, RECTUM, SIGMOID FLEXURE, AND COLON.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhysiologically, or in a normal state, the rectum is not a receptacle\r\nfor liquids and feces but a conduit during the act of defecation.\r\nShould, therefore, the feces have passed into the rectum and the desire\r\nto stool be not responded to--though the desire continue urgent--the\r\nfeces will be returned to the sigmoid cavity by physiological action.\r\nWhen, however, the functions of the anus and rectum are disturbed by\r\nchronic inflammation, etc., the lower portion of the rectum becomes a\r\nmore or less roomy pouch, a receptacle for feces and liquids; and\r\ninstead of being physiologically empty it becomes pathologically\r\ndistended, the result of spasmodic action or of more or less permanent\r\nstricture of the sphincter ani. See illustration in my book entitled\r\n_How to Become Strong_ (page 14).\r\n\r\nThe putrid fecal mass of solid and liquid contents accumulated in the\r\nartificial reservoir at the end of the intestinal sewer, is one of the\r\nmost common and serious pathogenic (disease-producing) and pyogenic\r\n(pus-producing) sources, which, by auto-infection, afflict man from\r\ninfancy to old age. Here--in the dilated and obstructed sewer--the\r\nptomain and leucomain class of poisons, and many of the poisonous\r\ngerms, led by the king of morbid disturbers, the bacillus coli\r\ncommunis, find another and last chance to be taken up by the absorbing\r\ncells of the mucous membrane and returned to the blood; with which they\r\nare carried to all parts of the body, clogging the glands, choking up\r\nthe pores and obstructing the circulation, thereby causing congestion\r\nand inflammation of the various organs. The action of cathartics,\r\nlaxatives, etc., fills the ano-rectal cavity with a watery solution of\r\nfoul substances; this solution is readily absorbed into the\r\ncirculation, aggravating the auto-intoxication (the established\r\nself-poisoned condition) already existing. Danger does not end with the\r\nabsorption of bacterial poisons, as we have to reckon with the\r\ndeleterious effects of the various intestinal gases, resulting, with\r\nrapid augmentation of volume, from the putrefactive changes in the\r\nimprisoned feculent matter.\r\n\r\nA sphincter ani permanently constricted or irritable owing to disease\r\nresults in an _abnormal_ receptacle just above the anal orifice (as\r\nshown in the illustration referred to); and a constricted and irritable\r\nrectum results in the impaction and dilatation of the sigmoid cavity,\r\nwhich is normally a receptacle, closed at its lower end by circular\r\nfibres separating it (the cavity) from the rectum and performing the\r\nfunction of a sphincter muscle. The rectal muscular fibres perform the\r\noffice of a sphincter for the sigmoid cavity. The pathological changes\r\nthat result in rectal impaction of feces usually extend to the sigmoid\r\ncavity. This cavity is 17-1/2 inches in length, shaped in a double\r\ncurve like an italic _S_. Civilized man should consider the disturbance\r\nto the functional action of body and brain, and the danger to health\r\nand longevity involved in the storage of effete and fetid matter. The\r\ndisturbance and danger are enhanced when the tissues of the sigmoid\r\nflexure and the rectum are invaded by inflammation. A healthy action of\r\nthe sigmoid receptacle depends on the rectum (a conduit six to eight\r\ninches in length); and as it is the universal verdict that disease of\r\nthe rectum is one of the most common maladies that afflict the human\r\nrace, it must inevitably follow that the feces will be abnormally\r\nstored in the sigmoid cavity, occasioning thereby habitual constipation\r\nwhich in turn brings on a host of functional disturbances throughout\r\nthe system.\r\n\r\nThe colon is a receptacle and a conduit some three feet in length (see\r\nib. p. 13) and its action depends upon the ability of the sigmoid\r\nflexure to perform its function as a final normal receptacle; and this\r\nin turn upon the rectum, which depends on the sphincter ani. The colon\r\ndoes not appear to possess any digestive powers, though it is capable\r\nof absorbing substances. Its function is not only to receive and\r\nforward the trifling residue of food which escapes digestion and\r\nabsorption, but chiefly to excrete, through its own minute glands, the\r\nwaste of the system coming from the blood.\r\n\r\nThe excretion from these glands of the colon into the colon, plus the\r\neffete portion of the food received by the colon from the small\r\nintestine, approximate in weight from four to six ounces in an adult\r\nperson in twenty-four hours; and of this amount passed 75 per cent is\r\nwater; so that were the excreta dried the solid matter thus evacuated\r\nwould not be found to weigh more than one ounce, or one and a half\r\nounces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nINDIGESTION, INTESTINAL GAS, AND OTHER MATTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe noted the fact that the \"digestive secretions\" in a man weighing 140\r\npounds amount to twenty-three pounds in twenty-four hours; now add to\r\nthese the food and liquids taken in that period, and you will form some\r\nestimate of the work done in the human chemical laboratory in its\r\nnormal and abnormal states.\r\n\r\nWe noted further that substances confined too long in receptacles\r\ndecompose and generate pathogenic poisons, that is, poisons productive\r\nof disease; and that the intestinal reservoirs are no exception to this\r\nlaw of putrefactive changes. How could we avoid drawing the inference,\r\ntherefore, that disease-breeding germs, (generated in the organism and\r\nhence called \"autogenetic\"), and their auto-infection, _i.e._,\r\nabsorption by the system, are an inevitable consequence of the undue\r\nretention and fermentation of the contents of these reservoirs: a\r\nconsequence, in other words, of that intestinal uncleanliness commonly\r\ncalled biliousness, constipation, indigestion.\r\n\r\nBy far the most common and immediate source of autogenetic\r\n(self-produced) poisons and their auto-infection, is some degree of\r\nchronic constipation and the deadening, smothering effects of\r\nconstipation on digestion; an effect analogous to what takes place when\r\nwe allow waste material or ashes to bank up against a fire, shutting\r\noff its draft. Does the fire then continue to digest the coal? Clog up\r\nthe receptacle for ashes and the coal grows cold. Dam up the colon or\r\nsigmoid and digestion is disturbed, diminished and debased, as\r\nevidenced by the local and general discomfort, and later by the train\r\nof inevitable disorders.\r\n\r\nIndigestion is a household word. It has the widest range of all the\r\ndiseases, because it forms a part of almost every other; and some\r\ndiseases, such as chronic catarrh and pulmonary consumption, are in\r\nmany cases produced by indigestion; which in turn had its source in\r\nchronic constipation caused by injury or inflammation of the lower\r\nbowel, as explained in our first chapter.\r\n\r\nDiminished nutrition, impoverished blood, and loss of weight of from\r\nten to twenty-five pounds, are the signs that indicate the coming\r\ndisaster to the sufferer from auto-intoxication: the thoroughly\r\npoisoned state of the system resulting from auto-infection.\r\n\r\nVessels used by the dairyman and by those who furnish us with food\r\nproducts and liquids are kept scrupulously clean. Why? Because it is a\r\nquestion of loss of trade--of money. Should these vessels be used when\r\nfoul from fermentation or putrefaction of their contents, Wealth would\r\nflee from the coffers of our purveyors, and the Boards of Health would,\r\nor rather should, take a hand in the matter. And these same purveyors,\r\nby the way, why do they care more for Wealth than for Health, their own\r\nand ours? But why are we all of us so neglectful of Inner cleanliness\r\nand so careful of Outer? The receptacles of the inner man reek with\r\naugean filth, and we cleanse them not. The immortal fountains of Health\r\nand Happiness are dammed, blasted and degraded by just this neglect of\r\nour imperative duty; the duty of furnishing full opportunity for the\r\nfunctions of replenishment and life, _by keeping the sewer passages\r\nclear_.\r\n\r\nAre a sour stomach and foul intestinal canal fit receptacles for food\r\nand liquids? When our receptacles are in this condition, why do we add\r\nmore material for the generation of poisons of the ptomain and\r\nleucomain classes, and morbid gaseous elements? It has been\r\ndemonstrated that during fermentation an apple will evolve a volume of\r\ngas six hundred times its own size. What folly then to add to the\r\nfermenting mass! Food taken under such conditions will produce results\r\nnot hard to imagine.\r\n\r\nThe gases that are commonly found in the stomach and small intestines\r\nare carbonic acid, nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen; while, besides all\r\nthese, sulphureted and carbureted hydrogen are found in the large\r\nintestine, causing in a normal state the necessary and useful\r\ndistention of the alimentary canal. The writer has long regarded the\r\nabnormal production of gaseous substances in the intestinal canal from\r\nputrefactive changes as of itself not only a grave menace to health,\r\nbut as a condition productive of morbific results of which we have\r\nstill much to learn. The more or less constant and excessive distention\r\nof the whole or even of a part of the intestinal canal by gases is a\r\nserious condition, affecting as it does the various organs of the body,\r\nnot only through the absorption of these gases into the general\r\ncirculation but also through the reflex nervous reaction of these\r\norgans. It is astonishing what amount of mechanical force is exerted by\r\nthe gases in the intestinal canal. They distend not only the muscular\r\nwalls of the intestines and stomach but the strong abdominal walls as\r\nwell, until the clothing worn has to be loosened for ease and comfort.\r\nThis more or less extreme mechanical pressure may account for many\r\ncases of hernia, prolapse of the uterus, dislocation of various organs,\r\ndisturbance of the circulation of the blood, and interference with the\r\nfunction of the nervous system, as indicated by its many protests in\r\nthe way of aches and pains. Naval-constructor Hobson has lately\r\ndemonstrated the dynamic power of gas confined in bags or receptacles\r\nin raising battleships; and it still remains for some physiologist or\r\npathologist to demonstrate the morbid dynamic results of gases confined\r\nin the alimentary apparatus. The deleterious effect of the abnormal\r\nquantity of gases on all the organs of the body is imperfectly\r\nunderstood at present, but will be better apprehended when we are able\r\nto study more minutely the pathogenic poisons of the human system. It\r\nis known, however, that a stream of carbonic acid gas, or even of\r\nhydrogen, will paralyze a muscle against which it is directed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nKEY TO AUTO-INFECTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a previous chapter we stated that the average quantity of fecal\r\ndischarge daily, by an adult, is from four to six ounces, and that of\r\nthis weight 75 per cent is water. We referred of course to the daily\r\npassage from the bowels alone, not including that from the bladder.\r\n\r\nOur studies have thus furnished us with the key wherewith to unlock the\r\nsecret chambers of auto-infection. What is that key? It is the\r\ndiscovery that the system may possibly absorb as high as three-fourths\r\nof this feculent substance in the colon; that this absorption is made\r\npossible by an obstructed or sluggish intestinal canal where disease\r\ngerms are propagated and lodged; that these germs, along with a certain\r\namount of excrement, invade the tissues by absorption; and that we thus\r\nhave the system constantly saturated with poisonous germs and filth,\r\nre-excreted, re-absorbed and re-secreted--no one knows how many\r\ntimes--by the various organs of the body.\r\n\r\nThat the importance of intestinal cleanliness may be better\r\nappreciated, I will quote from the following authors on the subjects of\r\nexcretion, absorption and circulation of the intestinal fluids.\r\n\r\nDr. Murchison states that:\r\n\r\n\"From what is now known of the diffusibility of fluids through animal\r\nmembranes, it is impossible to conceive bile long in contact with the\r\nlining membrane of the gall-bladder, bile-ducts, and intestine, without\r\na portion of it (including the dissolved pigment) passing into the\r\nblood. A circulation is constantly taking place between the fluid\r\ncontents of the bowel and the blood, the existence of which, till\r\nwithin the last few years, was quite unknown, and which even now is too\r\nlittle heeded. It is now known, says Dr. Parker, that in varying\r\ndegrees there is a constant transit of fluid from the blood into the\r\nalimentary canal, and as rapid absorption. The amount thus poured out\r\nand absorbed in twenty-four hours is almost incredible, and of itself\r\nconstitutes a secondary or intermediate circulation never dreamt of by\r\nHarvey. The amount of gastric juice alone passing into the stomach in a\r\nday, and then re-absorbed, amounted in the case lately examined by\r\nGrunewald to nearly 23 imperial pints. If we put it at 12 pints we\r\nshall certainly be within the mark. The pancreas, according to Kröger,\r\nfurnishes 12-1/2 pints in twenty-four hours, while the salivary glands\r\npour out at least 3 pints in the same time. The amount of the bile is\r\nprobably over 2 pints. The amount given out by the intestinal mucous\r\nmembrane cannot be guessed at, but must be enormous. Altogether the\r\namount of fluid effused into the alimentary canal in twenty-four hours\r\namounts to much more than the whole amount of blood in the body (which\r\nis 18 pounds in a man weighing 143 pounds); in other words, _every\r\nportion of the blood may, and possibly does, pass several times into\r\nthe alimentary canal in twenty-four hours_. The effect of this\r\ncontinual out-pouring is supposed to be to aid metamorphosis; the same\r\nsubstance more or less changed seems to be thrown out and re-absorbed\r\nuntil it be adapted for the repair of tissues, or become effete.\"\r\n\r\nThe reader will readily perceive how the system may become so charged\r\nthat other organs of the body will vicariously attempt to play the part\r\nof a receptacle and conduit for the bowel, in order to excrete and\r\neliminate ancient and offensive filth and bacterial poisons. The\r\nphenomenon of vicarious excretion may occur through the kidneys, lungs,\r\nskin, throat, nose, vagina, or uterus, thus keeping up chronic diseases\r\nand discharges that would not exist but for the chronic constipation or\r\neven for _incomplete action of the bowels each day_. Over-distention\r\nof the rectum, sigmoid and colon, due to the pressure of gases and the\r\nimpaction of feces, results in inflammation, ulceration, stricture,\r\nappendicitis, abscess, strangulation, intussusception, and abnormal\r\nballooning or roominess in certain portions of these intestines or\r\nconduits. This roominess, though it becomes filled with feces, and\r\noften with liquids, permits of sufficient space for even the daily\r\npassage of feces without dislodging the stored contents. The fact that\r\nthere is a passage daily deceives both sufferer and medical adviser as\r\nto the source of the poisonous condition of the system, and masks the\r\norigin of such disorders as chronic inflammation and ulceration of the\r\nnose, throat, lungs, stomach, duodenum, colon, appendix vermiformis,\r\nuterus, bladder, kidneys and edema of the legs. But these evidences of\r\nauto-infection are generally preceded and accompanied by a general loss\r\nof vitality and weight, by anemia, by a lowering of the resisting power\r\nof the organism--all of which produce a fit soil for the various\r\ndiseases to which flesh is heir. As soon as the system becomes\r\nsaturated with bacteria and effete matter, auto-intoxication results,\r\nin which condition there is but little or no store of vitality for\r\nresistance, reaction and recuperation.\r\n\r\nDr. Bright has recorded several instances of fecal accumulation in the\r\ncolon mistaken for enlargement of the liver and for malignant tumors.\r\nIn one of the cases there was jaundice which disappeared after free\r\nevacuation of the bowels. Frerichs also relates a case where\r\nenlargement from fecal accumulation was at first ascribed to a pregnant\r\nuterus, and subsequently, on the supervention of deep jaundice, to an\r\nenlarged liver, but in which purgatives dispelled the patient's anxiety\r\nabout a diseased liver and at the same time her hopes for a child.\r\n\r\nDr. N. Chapman, in his _Clinical Lectures_ (p. 304), says:\r\n\r\n    \"The feces sometimes accumulate in distinct indurated scybala or in\r\n    enormous masses, solid and compact. Taunton, a surgeon of London,\r\n    has a preparation of the colon and rectum of more than twenty\r\n    inches in circumference containing three gallons of feces, taken\r\n    from a woman, whose abdomen was as much distended as in the\r\n    maturity of pregnancy. By Lemazurier, another case is reported of a\r\n    pregnant woman, who was constipated for two months, from whom,\r\n    after death, thirteen and one-half pounds of solid feces were taken\r\n    away, though a short time before between two and three pounds had\r\n    been scraped out of the rectum. Cases are reported by Dr. Graves of\r\n    Dublin, which he saw in women, where from the great distentions in\r\n    certain directions of the abdomen, the one was considered to be\r\n    owing to a prodigious hypertrophy of the liver, and the other of\r\n    the ovary; in the latter of which he removed a bucket-full of feces\r\n    in two days. Mr. Wilmot of London has recently given a case where a\r\n    gallon of matter was lodged in the cæcum, and the intestines\r\n    perforated by ulceration.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Pavy, in his treatise on _The Functions of Digestion_ (p. 232),\r\nwrites:\r\n\r\n    \"The morbid conditions that constipation may occasion are of\r\n    various kinds. Under an undue retention of fecal matters within the\r\n    colon noxious products may be formed there, and act as irritants\r\n    upon the mucous coat, setting up inflammation, followed by\r\n    ulceration. It is to be here remarked that fecal matters are\r\n    sometimes retained in the sacculi or pouches of the colon, and may\r\n    give rise to the circumstances referred to, whilst a passage exists\r\n    along the centre of the canal that shall permit a daily evacuation\r\n    to occur. The dejections, even, may be loose in character, and\r\n    still the same sequence of events ensue. From the irritating\r\n    influence of preternaturally retained feces, colicky pains are, as\r\n    a rule, induced, and the ultimate effects may be such as to lead to\r\n    the production of fatal inflammation.\r\n\r\n    \"The effect of constipation upon the muscular coat of the bowel is,\r\n    through distention to which it is subjected, to weaken or\r\n    deteriorate its evacuating power. As the result of a great amount\r\n    of distention, like as happens in the case of the urinary bladder,\r\n    more or less complete paralysis is induced. From the prolonged\r\n    retention of fecal matter accompanying constipation,\r\n    excrementitious products that ought to be eliminated become\r\n    absorbed and thereby contaminate the contents of the circulatory\r\n    system. As the result of this contamination, the secretions become\r\n    vitiated, and a general disturbance of the conditions of life is\r\n    produced. The action of the liver becoming deranged, its\r\n    eliminative office is imperfectly discharged, and thus sallowness\r\n    of the face and a bilious-tinged conjunctiva are produced. A coated\r\n    tongue, foul mouth, loss of appetite, and other dyspeptic\r\n    manifestations, accompany the general disorder of the digestive\r\n    organs that prevails. The accumulation existing in the colon leads\r\n    to a sense of distention and uneasiness in the abdomen. The kidneys\r\n    vicariously discharge products that ought to have been eliminated\r\n    by the alimentary canal. In this manner the urine becomes\r\n    preternaturally loaded. From the contaminated state of the blood\r\n    the functions of animal life also become disturbed; and hence the\r\n    lassitude, debility, headache, giddiness and dejected spirits, that\r\n    form such frequent accompaniments of constipation.... A distended\r\n    cæcum, colon, and rectum may also, by the pressure exerted upon the\r\n    nerves and vessels of the lower extremities, be the cause of\r\n    numbness, cramps, pains and edema of the legs. The edema occasioned\r\n    by constipation, if not exclusively confined to one side, will in\r\n    all probability be decidedly greater in one leg than in the other.\"\r\n\r\nCase (from _Gaz. Méd. de Paris_, July 20, 1839): A woman of fifty was\r\ntroubled with habitual diarrhea and frequent calls to urinate, in which\r\nurine could be discharged only by drops. After six years of suffering\r\nand unsuccessful use of remedies, she was examined for the first time\r\nper anum, and an accumulation of fecal matter discovered, forming a\r\nmass the size of an infant's head. This was removed and found to weigh\r\nfour pounds. She then got well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nHOW AUTO-INFECTION AFFECTS THE GASTRIC DIGESTION, AND VICE VERSA.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrederick the Great said that all culture comes through the stomach.\r\nThis saying emphasizes pithily the dependence of psychology upon\r\nphysiology. The stomach with the intestines is certainly the source\r\nfrom which every portion of the body receives its nourishment and most\r\nof its diseases. The physiological _plus_ and _minus_ processes leave\r\ntheir reflex on the mind.\r\n\r\nProf. Ch. Bouchard, in his lectures on Auto-Intoxication (Oliver's\r\ntrans., p. 14), says: \"The organism in its normal, as in its\r\npathological state, is a receptacle and a laboratory of poisons.\r\nAmongst these some are formed by the organism itself, others by\r\nmicrobes, which either are the guests, the normal inhabitants of the\r\nintestinal tube, or are parasites at second-hand, and disease\r\nproducing.\"\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapters we have mentioned some of the most common\r\ncases of retention of excreta in the rectum, sigmoid cavity, colon,\r\ncecum, duodenum and stomach, and how the consequent foul conditions\r\noften resulted in diarrhea. Auto-infection impairs the functions of\r\nevery organ in the body, by clogging the pores with poisons and filth.\r\nBy the transfer of disease germs from one infected, that is, tainted,\r\ncontaminated part of the body to parts that were free from infection,\r\nthe kidneys, mucous membrane and skin receive these unnatural products,\r\nand their functions are disturbed thereby. The disturbance of the\r\nvarious organs throughout the system sets up such a multiplicity of\r\nsymptoms that one gets the impression of a pandemonium--a veritable\r\ncouncil-hall of evil spirits. The visitation is omnipresent.\r\nInfliction, misery, are everywhere. The taint of auto-generated\r\nintestinal morbific products, carried and communicated to the remotest\r\nparts, manifests itself now here now there as if it were a local\r\ntrouble, and it is difficult therefore, nay, impossible, to classify\r\nscientifically the symptoms of auto-infection. A classification, though\r\nnecessarily imperfect, will aid in the diagnosis and treatment of the\r\nvarious abnormal conditions of the stomach and intestines, that is, of\r\nmal-digestion. The sympathy, good understanding and responsiveness\r\nbetween the brain and the digestive apparatus are so close and intimate\r\nthat the physician must take into consideration the inter-relationship\r\nof these organs before deciding which one is reporting reflex nervous\r\nsymptoms, and which direct symptoms. Plutarch says in one of his\r\nessays: \"Should the body sue the mind before a court judicature for\r\ndamages, it would be found that the mind had been a ruinous tenant to\r\nits landlord.\" The digestive apparatus is, or should be, a farm for the\r\nmind, but unfortunately it usually has to wait twenty or more years\r\nbefore the tenant understands how to cultivate it for the uses of his\r\nintellectual and esthetical life.\r\n\r\nI have referred to the fact that the most common causes of\r\nconstipation, indigestion and other foul conditions of the alimentary\r\ncanal favorable to the production of autogenetic poisons and their\r\nauto-infection, are such common and every-day matters, so familiar to\r\nalmost every one that the victim, the parents and the physician feel no\r\nalarm of the coming danger for years. During these ignorant and\r\ninnocent years the poison and filth were being absorbed, infecting the\r\nsystem with their morbific taint and lowering the quality of the blood\r\nand lessening its quantity, producing the state known as anemia.\r\nAssociated with progressive anemia is mal-assimilation, improper\r\nnutrition, ebbing of the nervous and vital forces and the lessening of\r\nthe secretory, excretory and digestive powers. By the time the poor\r\nvictim is weighing fifteen to twenty-five pounds less than he ought to\r\nthe symptoms of ill-health are sufficiently alarming to compel the\r\nsufferer to seek medical aid for disease of the stomach, bowels, liver,\r\nkidneys, lungs, etc.\r\n\r\n_Slow digestion_ is perhaps the most common form of functional\r\ndisturbance of the stomach, due to an insidious auto-infection for\r\nyears. The eyes and the skin begin to show the effect of the poisonous\r\ninfection. The skin becomes dry, pale and muddy in color; has more or\r\nless annoying eruptions, and exhibits a jaundiced appearance. The body\r\nis ill nourished, the nervous system depressed, the blood impoverished,\r\nthe memory failing, the general appearance languid, irritable, anxious.\r\nWhat a household picture this is to every one of the human family! But\r\nlet us fill it out somewhat more fully. Note how the undue delay of\r\nfood in the stomach occasions a sense of weight and oppression, the\r\nfeeling beginning about an hour after a meal and continuing for hours,\r\nsometimes attended with fermentation and sometimes without it. At times\r\nthere is a feeling of drowsiness due to the absorption of an excessive\r\namount of the gases which distend the stomach and bowels, and this\r\nabsorption is accompanied by pains in the stomach, head, between the\r\nshoulders and in the region of the heart. Sleep is disturbed by dreams,\r\nor one is awakened with a feeling of numbness and palpitation of the\r\nheart. At times the urine is scanty, strongly acid or high-colored. The\r\ntongue is more or less foul, with white or creamy coating. Now and then\r\ntasteless or saltish eructations occur. The appetite may be too good,\r\nor there is no appetite at all. Note the careworn expression, the\r\nwondering what to eat, what to drink or what remedy to take. So between\r\nmuch worse and some better, the trouble continues--both of body and\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n_Indigestion_, however, with undue formation of acids proper, or acids\r\nunnatural, to the stomach, is a much more annoying affliction than slow\r\ndigestion. The sufferer from indigestion may be debilitated, anemic,\r\nmay have a general want of tone; or he may be a more or less vigorous\r\nand plethoric person. In some cases flatulence is very troublesome. But\r\nthe most usual symptoms are heartburn, acid eructations that produce\r\nburning sensations, sour taste at intervals or constantly in the mouth,\r\nsetting the teeth on edge. In the more vigorous or plethoric sufferers\r\na gouty diathesis may exist, which may result in a tendency to\r\ninflammation, bringing on neuralgia, rheumatism, gout, etc. Tongue more\r\nor less foul; uric acid in the system; confusion in the mind;\r\nheadaches; pains in the loins, legs and feet; in fact, more or less\r\nshifting pains everywhere: these are the common exhibits of\r\nindigestion. On the whole, the sufferer is a victim to an irritable\r\nbody and a fretful mind, necessitating the cultivation by him of\r\npatience and the effort to be agreeable.\r\n\r\nBesides the symptoms mentioned, indigestion may also be accompanied by\r\ngastric pain or by uneasiness at the pit of the stomach. It may be a\r\nsense of fulness or tightness, or a feeling of distention or weight, or\r\nagain, a feeling of emptiness, goneness or sinking. Now and then there\r\nare burning, tearing, gnawing, dragging sensations under the\r\nbreast-bone; and there is a general complaint of a capricious appetite,\r\nheartburn, vomiting, nervous headache, neuralgia and cold extremities.\r\nOther symptoms are pain from lack of food at the proper hour, or from\r\nfood taken at the improper time; both of which practices may be\r\nfollowed by flatulency, occasioning a swollen, drum-like condition of\r\nthe stomach and abdomen; the body of the tongue will be coated white,\r\nwhile the edges will present a redder appearance than in health.\r\n\r\n_Impaired digestion_ with nervous symptoms--in which the morbid\r\nsensibility of the mind is apparently the greatest--is called\r\n_hypochondria_. This class of sufferers, whose bodily and mental ills\r\nand morbid fears are so chaotically interwoven, are deserving of much\r\nconsideration. So numerous are their fears and so fertile are their\r\nreasons for the many changes they arbitrarily make in their efforts to\r\nget well or keep from getting worse, so obstinately sure are they of\r\nbeing always right--that we can but give them our sincerest pity.\r\n\r\nIn some cases the functional troubles of the stomach and mind are\r\naggravated by disease of the pelvic organs, which adds to the\r\ndepression of the mind through nervous sympathy with the abdominal\r\norgans.\r\n\r\nDr. Cullen says on this point:--\r\n\r\n    \"In certain persons there is a state of mind distinguished by a\r\n    concurrence of the following circumstances: a languor, a\r\n    listlessness, or want of resolution and activity with respect to\r\n    all undertakings; a disposition to seriousness, sadness and\r\n    timidity as to all future events; an apprehension of the worst or\r\n    most unhappy state of them; and therefore, often upon slight\r\n    grounds, an apprehension of great evil. Such persons are\r\n    particularly attentive to the state of their own health, to every\r\n    smallest change of feeling in their bodies; and from any unusual\r\n    feeling, perhaps of the slightest kind, they apprehend great danger\r\n    and even death itself. In respect to all these feelings and\r\n    apprehensions, there is commonly the most obstinate belief and\r\n    persuasion.\" (Quoted in Leared, _On Imperfect Digestion_, p. 106.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nHOW AUTO-INFECTION AFFECTS INTESTINAL DIGESTION, AND VICE VERSA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntestinal indigestion is a more common form of functional disturbance\r\nthan is gastric indigestion. It is a well established fact that the\r\ngreater portion of the digestive work is done beyond the stomach, in\r\nthe duodenum, by the hepatic and pancreatic fluids. The duodenum--very\r\nproperly called the _second stomach_--has none of the peculiar\r\ncharacteristics of a receptacle that receives crude substances--the\r\noffice of the stomach. Much greater sensitiveness characterizes the\r\ndigestive canal than the stomach; which is accounted for by the fact\r\nthat a network of nerves, forming the sympathetic system, surrounds the\r\nbowels. The symptoms of intestinal indigestion are not always clearly\r\ndefined and distinguishable from gastric indigestion, especially as the\r\ntwo are frequently associated.\r\n\r\nThe cecum, more than any other portion of the digestive canal,\r\nresembles the stomach, and it secretes an acid, albuminous fluid having\r\nconsiderable solvent properties. It is to be observed that as the cecum\r\nis only three inches in length and two and a half in diameter, and as\r\nits contents are necessarily propelled in opposition to gravity, a\r\nslight casualty will hinder or obstruct the upward movement of the\r\npultaceous mass of the effete ingesta. The turning point in the\r\nascending colon affords another ready hindrance to the upward and\r\nonward movement of this mass; and the gases and ancient feces beyond\r\nthe turn conduce to further sluggish peristalsis, bringing about more\r\nor less obstruction and reflex irritation of the remaining length of\r\nintestinal canal. Undue retention of the contents of the cecum, and the\r\ndisturbance and obstruction of the duodenum by the pressure incident to\r\nthe distention of the colon with feces and gases, lead to congestion,\r\ninflammation and occasionally to ulceration of the mucous membrane in\r\nvarious parts of the intestinal tube.\r\n\r\nThis condition of affairs increases the occlusion (closing) of the\r\nbowels, but makes very easy indeed the entrance and propagation of\r\nmicro-organisms in the sub-mucous coat of the intestine. The conditions\r\nare now ripe and rife for auto-infection. Which of the following\r\nmicrobes are the most active agents of progressive auto-infection: the\r\nstreptococcus lanceolatus, the bacterium pyogenes, the bacillus\r\nsubtilis, the staphylococci, the bacterium coli commune? They all play\r\na part in the game, reducing the body in time to a charnel-house. Or\r\nare such substances as putrescein, cadaverin, skatol or indol--which\r\nare derived through chemical change in the putrescent mass--contributors\r\nto the spread of the poisonous taint throughout the system? Any single\r\none or a group of the fifty or more bacterial poisons may be the\r\nresponsible agents in the ensuing auto-infection. Chemical analysis of\r\nthe gases resulting from decomposition reveals oxygen, nitrogen,\r\nhydrogen, carbonic acid, protocarbonated hydrogen and sulphureted\r\nhydrogen, ammonia, and sulphate of ammonia. Leucin, tyrosin, lithic\r\nacid, lithates, xanthin, cystin, keratin, sulphureted hydrogen, etc.,\r\nare deposits in the urine and are signs of the derangement of the\r\nintestinal canal and liver. The external symptoms observed are the\r\nfollowing: the tongue is large, pale, flabby and indented by the teeth\r\nat the edge of the anterior third, while its surface is white and the\r\npapillæ often enlarged; the appetite may be excellent, though there is\r\ngreat functional derangement of the liver with lithemia, so that the\r\nsufferer is tempted to eat what he knows from experience will disagree\r\nwith him; a bitter coppery taste in the mouth, due to taurocholic\r\nacid--a common symptom of lithemia or of imperfect oxidation of\r\nalbumen; emaciation, fatigue, depression, headache, buzzing in the ears\r\nand deafness, disturbance of sight, loss of memory, faintness and\r\nvertigo, very marked in some cases; sometimes tenderness and pain under\r\nthe cartilages of the right ribs; the fretting of the sensitive surface\r\nof the bowels by imperfectly digested, semi-putrescent food, resulting\r\nsometimes in convulsions, coma, paralysis, or in fetid diarrhea of an\r\nacid character producing a burning sensation or pain of the anus when\r\nthe discharges are being passed; rumbling and twisting sensations in\r\nthe region of the navel occurring with flatulency, and occasionally\r\ncolicky pains which at times are so severe as to simulate poisoning.\r\n\r\nIn some people certain articles of food, without being either toxic or\r\nputrid, induce indigestion and the production of microbes in quantity\r\namounting to one third of fecal dejections. Prof. Ch. Bouchard says:\r\n\r\n    \"The consequence of this development of acid in the whole length of\r\n    the digestive tube is an inflammatory condition. We notice catarrh\r\n    of the stomach, ulcerative gastritis, to which patients often\r\n    succumb after twenty-five years of _bad stomach_; these are the\r\n    _false cancers_, as they are called, or malignant gastritis\r\n    without tumor. The large intestine is inflamed; around the fecal\r\n    matter are seen glairy secretions and sometimes blood (membranous\r\n    enteritis).\" (Op. cit., p. 159.)\r\n\r\nIn chronic inflammation of the rectum and colon there is more or less\r\ndischarge of mucous, and in some cases of membranous, desquamation,\r\nwith yellow or bloody mucus. The shreds, cords or complete tubular\r\ncasts are discharged constantly or at varying intervals. The quantity\r\nand character often alarm the sufferer. The discharge is nothing less\r\nthan a thick, tenacious mucus that had formed a thin coating on the\r\ninflamed mucous membrane, and become exfoliated in casts or thin\r\nshreds--the result of many years of morbid intestinal exaggerated\r\naction.\r\n\r\nMicroscopical examination of the desquamated intestinal membrane and\r\nmucus from a man forty years of age, revealed the following products:\r\ncrystals, mostly complete; incomplete phosphates, very numerous; mucous\r\nshreds in abundance; fat globules and granules, numerous; anal\r\nepithelia; red blood globules, few; connective tissue, scanty; pus\r\ncorpuscles, very few; margaric acid and detritus (substances resulting\r\nfrom the destruction or wearing away of the part); undigested material,\r\nmostly cellulose; leptothrix threads, micrococci; and the bacillus coli\r\ncommunis. Diagnosis: foul, undigested material, due to a chronic\r\ninflammation of the lower intestinal tract. The microscopical\r\nexamination of mucus and desquamated membrane from a woman sixty-five\r\nyears of age, disclosed that she was suffering from proctitis and\r\ncolitis. She wrote: \"Please tell me how long this mucous discharge must\r\ncontinue. I am alarmed at the quantity of membrane, cords, casts, etc.,\r\nin my excreta, and I think that if this process goes on much longer\r\nthere will soon be no bowels left to purify.\" This letter was written\r\nsome weeks after contracting a severe cold, which accounts for the\r\nunusual amount of exfoliation and mucus. The sample she sent contained\r\na large quantity of mucus, both threads and corpuscles; with a moderate\r\nnumber of epithelial scales, partly anal and partly intestinal. Pus\r\ncorpuscles were present in small numbers; also vegetable fibres, fat,\r\nstarch, muscle fibres and cellulose--the remains of undigested\r\nmaterial. In the membranes themselves no micro-organisms were found; in\r\nthe pieces containing undigested material the bacillus coli communis\r\nwas found as well as micrococci, and the bacilli of putrefaction\r\n(secondary formation) were seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE CAUSE OF CONSTIPATION AND HOW WE IGNORANTLY TREAT IT.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the best preparations for active life is a first-class\r\nintestinal canal.\r\n\r\n\"An old Scotch physician,\" says Sir Astley Cooper, \"for whom I had a\r\ngreat respect and whom I frequently met in consultation, used to say to\r\nme as we were about to enter our patient's room together, 'Weel,\r\nMisther Cooper, we ha' only twa things to keep in meend, and they'll\r\nserve us for here and herea'ter; one is au'ways to hae the fear o' the\r\nLaird before our e'es, that'll do for herea'ter; and th' t'other is to\r\nkeep our boo'els au'ways open, and that'll do for here.'\"\r\n\r\nA person whose mind is devoted to the realization of ideals, and whose\r\nbody has a set of bowels that perform the act of defecation twice every\r\ntwenty-four hours is doubly prepared for a useful life.\r\n\r\n    \"If thou well observe\r\n    In what thou eat'st and drink'st, seek from thence\r\n    Due nourishment, not gluttonous delight,\r\n    Till many years over thy head return:\r\n    So may'st thou live, till like ripe fruit thou drop\r\n    Into thy mother's lap, or be with ease\r\n    Gathered, not harshly plucked, for death mature.\"\r\n\r\nMilton's advice in poetic lines is all very well for those who have\r\nescaped chronic inflammation of the lower bowels, an ailment common and\r\ntroublesome even under the very best dietetic regulations.\r\n\r\nInflammation having once penetrated the circular and longitudinal\r\nmuscular fibres or bands of a section of the intestine, all hope of a\r\ncomfortable existence is at an end, for such inflammation will bring on\r\nconstipation and constipation nervous misery. It is inevitable that\r\ninflammation should determine this outcome since it induces spasmodic\r\ncontraction of the muscular walls of the tube, lessening the bore or\r\nclosing the portion of the canal invaded. Plastic infiltration takes\r\nplace in the walls of the gut, thickening and binding them together;\r\nor, if the inflammation be of a simple catarrhal or atrophic nature,\r\nthe plastic infiltration will more or less bind the circular muscular\r\nbands of the gut together in their abnormally contracted state! The\r\npresence of feces and gases above the zone of the disease will increase\r\nthe irritation and contraction of the affected portion of the\r\nintestine. Consequent upon these changes wrought by inflammation, gases\r\nand excrementitious material are perforce imprisoned in the intestine,\r\ninducing constipation, foul fermentation, flatulency, diarrhea,\r\nindigestion, nausea, loss of appetite, sick headache and, in fine,\r\nautogenetic poisons, the source of auto-infection, ending in\r\nauto-intoxication, the chronic poisoned condition of the system.\r\n\r\nSince the most common cause of chronic constipation, internal\r\nsluggishness and uncleanliness, is known, too much cannot be said in\r\ncondemnation of the wide-spread abuse of \"liver and atony persuaders\"\r\nand the use of irritating suppositories and dilating bougies, candles,\r\netc. The numerous and various drastic purgative nostrums--which\r\nliterally fill our medical literature--and the universal demand for\r\nthem, are evidence of this very common disease, which disease is\r\nrendered worse by the drugs taken for the relief of a foul intestinal\r\nalveus. An abnormal amount of watery secretion is forced by the drug\r\ninto the foul canal, to mix there with its contents, of which the major\r\nportion is retained and re-absorbed into the system. And to make the\r\nbad condition and treatment worse, all such sufferers, as a rule, drink\r\nvery little water, some scarcely any.\r\n\r\nThe demand for an irritating stimulus to \"open the bowels\" (the\r\nexciters contribute to close them) is largely due to the popular error\r\nin thinking, \"I can treat my own bowels quite as well as the doctor, if\r\nnot better.\" No intelligent person would think of stimulating and\r\nirritating daily an inflamed region of tissue on the outer portion of\r\nthe body; yet this is precisely what intelligent persons do when they\r\nhabitually use liver and peristaltic persuaders. The primary disease in\r\nthe lower bowels and the consequent symptoms are gradually aggravated\r\nas the \"physic\" habit is formed.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of opium fiends and drunkards, so with habitual\r\ncathartic drug-users, should they be suddenly deprived of the\r\naccustomed artificial stimulus and irritant they become absolutely\r\nmiserable, mentally and physically. It is a well-known physiological\r\nfact that every artificial stimulation of the intestines is followed by\r\na corresponding loss of vitality and reaction. Now that the almost\r\nuniversal cause of undue retention of foul, effete matter has been\r\nascertained, it is important to communicate to the world at large the\r\nbest means of cleansing the bowels without increasing the local primary\r\ndisease and its annoying symptoms.\r\n\r\nThat external physical cleanliness is next to godliness is an apt\r\nproverb. That internal physical cleanliness is nearer to godliness no\r\none will deny.\r\n\r\nWater is a universal solvent and therapeutic agent and is therefore\r\nindispensable in the cleansing and purifying of the integument and\r\nmucous membrane of the body. A large quantity of water is necessary to\r\ncarry on the functions of the animal economy. Water enters every cell\r\nand fibre of the living organism, aiding in nutrition and in the\r\nelimination of worn-out tissues which if retained turn into poisons.\r\n\r\nIt is really not an intelligent but rather a barbarous practice to\r\nprescribe liver and intestinal exciters for the purpose of throwing\r\ninto the alimentary tract a sufficient quantity of watery excretions to\r\n\"cleanse itself\"; to succeed they must first soften and liquefy the\r\ndry, hardened feces and scybalous masses (little ancient, bullet-like\r\nformations) imprisoned above an inflamed and fevered lower bowel, even\r\ncolon.\r\n\r\nNormal feces consist of 75 per cent water; and when unduly retained in\r\nthe colon much of this fetid percentage is absorbed into the system.\r\nThen drugs are prescribed to liquefy the hardened putrid remnant and\r\nabsorption begins again: a fact very shocking to a sensitive, even\r\nsensible, person.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nCURES FOR CONSTIPATION: \"FEARFULLY AND WONDERFULLY MADE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDiseases of the anus and rectum are very common, very numerous and of\r\nvery critical consequences. This is especially true of the disease of\r\nchronic inflammation, one of whose symptoms is piles or hemorrhoids. In\r\nthe writings of the early Greek and Roman physicians will be found\r\nminute descriptions of the latter disorder. But on the whole, the most\r\nimportant symptom of chronic inflammation of the lower bowel, and the\r\nmost far-reaching in its morbific results, is that protean monster,\r\nchronic constipation. It deranges more lives, from infancy to old age,\r\nthan any other pathological condition that can be named.\r\n\r\nFor the cause and cure of that mere symptom of a disease, constipation,\r\nthe so-called scientific physicians, from the early history of\r\nmedication to the present time, have had one immutable theory as to the\r\nleading cause, and one grand motto as to the \"safe and sure\" cure. They\r\nhave always prescribed remedies for this malady on the theory of portal\r\ncongestion and hepatic derangement, and hence their supreme motto:\r\n\"_Physic! Physic!! Physic!!!_\"\r\n\r\nThe layman naturally adopted the theory and the motto of his medical\r\nadvisers; hence in his self-medication and also under advice he\r\nconsumes such vast quantities of purgative nostrums.\r\n\r\nI have just received some medical literature beginning with the usual\r\nsalutation--\"Dear Doctor\"--setting forth a new and remarkable theory of\r\nthe cause, and an original motto for the cure, of constipation. Its\r\nauthors have discovered that the \"rectal nerve-tissues\" are hungry,\r\ntorpid, anemic, and to overcome the \"atony\" they must be \"_Fed! Fed!!\r\nFed!!!_\"\r\n\r\n\"The greatest of physical ills in America,\" we are informed, \"is\r\ndigestive torpor or semi-paralysis, originally induced by a kind of\r\nstarvation of the intestinal nerve-tissues. One of its most prevalent\r\nforms is constipation,\" caused by \"local torpor or semi-paralysis,\r\ndependent upon an anemic condition of the nerve-tissues of the rectal\r\nregion.\" By \"feeding directly\" the limpid, bedraggled rectum and colon,\r\nthey receive their \"appropriate nutriment, by which comes added\r\nvigor,\"--the nutriment the stomach and the rest of the system had\r\nfailed to furnish on account of constipation, excessive fermentation,\r\nindigestion and auto-infection.\r\n\r\nTo overcome this \"atony\" of two or more feet of the lower bowel, a\r\nlittle \"nutritious\" suppository, weighing twenty grains, is a\r\n\"specific.\" It is claimed to cure chronic auto-infection and the\r\nspasmodic occlusion of the lower bowel! The excessive activity of all\r\nthe region invaded by the chronic inflammation and the local irritation\r\nare perpetuated by such \"feeding\" instead of allayed! Does it not stand\r\nto reason that there is already too much activity, and that when the\r\nirritability reaches a certain stage diarrhea or looseness of the\r\nbowels must result? Twenty grains prescribed once a day to nourish an\r\norgan (the rectum) six to eight inches in length, and from one and a\r\nhalf to two and a half inches in diameter! When for two to three feet\r\nthe lower bowel requires nourishment, a suppository night and morning\r\nis prescribed! However, the new treatment has the merit of some\r\nconsistency between the diagnosis and the treatment, notwithstanding\r\nboth are wrong.\r\n\r\nChronic inflammation of the lower bowel causes, as I have pointed out,\r\nexcessive activity and thereby excessive nutrition of the tissues\r\ninvolved in the morbid process. But sphincter ani gymnastics have been\r\nsuggested by some one who thinks chronic constipation is owing to a\r\nlack of muscular activity of the lower bowels; and the following reason\r\nis given:\r\n\r\n\"Physiological experiments have shown that rapid voluntary movements of\r\nthe external sphincter ani and the levator ani produce very active\r\nperistaltic movements of the large intestine. This effect is produced\r\nby the mechanical excitement of the plexus myentericus of Auerbach.\r\nThis curious automatic center lies between the two muscular coats of\r\nthe intestine and controls the peristaltic movements. A person\r\nsuffering from constipation should make powerful movements of the\r\nsphincter ani, and of the levator ani, in as rapid succession as\r\npossible, continuing the exercise for three or four minutes or until\r\nthe muscles are fatigued. The time chosen for this exercise should be\r\neither before breakfast or an hour after breakfast, according to the\r\nnatural habit of the individual in respect to the evacuation of the\r\nlarge intestines.\"\r\n\r\nThere are surgeons who recommend stretching and paralyzing the external\r\nsphincter muscle; and if they are correct in their diagnosis and\r\ntreatment, those who prescribe _bile-bouncers_, and those who prescribe\r\n\"_nutrient suppositories_,\" and those who prescribe the use of _rubber\r\nbougies_ and _candles_, should call a convention (to meet in, say, New\r\nYork City) to discuss the subject and see if they cannot agree to\r\ninform the people that constipation is a sign of, or a factor in, the\r\nevolution of the human race. Those who believe in the gymnastics of\r\nman's ears and of his sphincter ani and the therapeutic merits of this\r\nand of that could readily assent to the same glorious conclusion.\r\n\r\nStrange to say, there are in New York physicians who are in the habit\r\nof inserting a rubber bougie up their patients' rectums two or three\r\ntimes a week for the cure of constipation. Some, more bold, intrust the\r\nbougie performance to the patient in order that a daily dilatation and\r\nstimulation may be kept up until \"recovery from the disease is\r\neffected.\" Others, more original, order the patient to insert a candle\r\nsome six inches in length up the rectum and allow it to remain ten\r\nminutes, with the hope of a \"rapid cure.\"\r\n\r\nA Mrs. P----, who had used the candle treatment for a great length of\r\ntime by order of her distinguished physician, once consulted me. On\r\nexamination, I found her afflicted with atrophic catarrh, chronic\r\nconstipation and anal ulceration, from which she had suffered for seven\r\nyears, with but little intermission from pain during each day of that\r\nentire period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nBILIOUSNESS AND BILIOUS ATTACKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCommonly the source of chronic gastro-intestinal uncleanliness, of\r\ndyspepsia, of autogenetic poisons and auto-infection is inflammatory\r\nocclusion--more or less permanent or spasmodic--of some part of the\r\nlower bowel. Many years of auto-infection will exhibit such diseased\r\nsymptoms as poor appetite, bad digestion, impoverished blood,\r\nemaciation, etc., accompanied by increased virulence of the catarrhal\r\ndischarge of mucus, shreds, etc., and a mind and body sinking down to\r\nthe morbid plane of hysteria, hypochondriasis (fear of illness) and\r\nneurasthenia (debility of the nervous system).\r\n\r\nBiliousness and bilious attacks are evidence that there is a more or\r\nless constipated condition, that there has been an occasional\r\nimprudence in diet, and that the dreadful sense of fulness up to the\r\nend of the tongue is a faithful report of the state of affairs. What is\r\nit but a full foul condition of the digestive canal, a complete\r\nblockade of the canal from the rectum or colon to the stomach, making\r\nthe victim feel that there must be something done in the way of\r\ncleaning out? He fears that the condition will be followed by\r\nfever--not infrequently this is the case. Biliousness is usually\r\nsupposed to be occasioned by hindrance to the flow of bile, and the\r\nconclusion is drawn that the liver requires stimulating. This\r\nsupposition is erroneous and very far from pathological veritude, as\r\nthe liver, like the other organs, is merely _a secondary sufferer from\r\nthe over-eating and the closed sewer_.\r\n\r\n    \"The _bowels_ with sullen vapours cloud the brain,\r\n    And bind the spirits in _their_ heavy chain;\r\n    Howe'er the cause fantastick may appear,\r\n    The effect is real, and the pain severe.\"\r\n\r\nThe bilious attack is usually noticed in the morning before food has\r\nbeen taken. The tongue is heavily coated and often so foul that it is\r\nnecessary to scrape it and cleanse the mouth of disagreeable taste.\r\nEructations, nausea followed by vomiting of undigested foul-smelling\r\nfood, and if the vomiting be long-continued, mucus from the stomach and\r\nbile that had accumulated in the duodenum, are sufficient evidence that\r\nthere was no torpidity of the liver. There is likewise more or less\r\nheadache, neuralgia, giddiness, hebetude (state of mild stupidity),\r\ndejection, confusion of the senses, skin disease, acne rosacea (scarlet\r\nredness of the nose and cheeks), eczema, etc. The headache may be\r\nseated in the centre of the brain and extend to one or both eyeballs\r\nand be increased by stooping. Should diarrhea occur many of the\r\nannoying symptoms are likely not to be present.\r\n\r\nIn this form of indigestion the bowels are often much constipated,\r\nwhich is usually only a more marked symptom of chronic constipation.\r\nThe system now and then vigorously rebels against this chronic\r\ncondition and an acute bilious attack is the evidence of such\r\nrebellion. The whole digestive canal is involved in the rebellion,\r\nresulting in the symptoms described and also in a morose, petulant\r\nand querulous temper, accompanied by a peculiar, despairing\r\nexpression,--partly due, perhaps, to regrets of having only _one_\r\ndigestive apparatus,--or in some cases, perhaps, of having _any_.\r\n\r\nThat the character and disposition may be materially influenced by such\r\na state of the bowels is well established. Plato believed that \"an\r\ninfirm constitution is an obstacle to virtue, because such persons\r\nthink of nothing but their own wretched carcasses\"; for which reason he\r\ncontended that Æsculapius should not undertake to patch up persons\r\nhabitually complaining, lest they beget children as useless as\r\nthemselves, being persuaded that it was an injury both to the community\r\nand to the infirm person himself that he continue in the world, even\r\nthough he were richer than Midas.\r\n\r\nActing on this well-known fact, the celebrated Voltaire, in one of the\r\narticles in his _Philosophical Dictionary_, has very humorously\r\nascribed half the evils of Europe to the intestinal irritations of the\r\npublic men of the age.\r\n\r\n\"Let the person,\" he adds, \"who may wish to ask a favor of a minister,\r\nor a minister's secretary, or kept mistress, endeavor previously, by\r\nall means, to ascertain whether they go to stool regularly; and, if\r\npossible, to approach them after a comfortable evacuation, that being a\r\nmost propitious moment, one of the _mollia tempora fandi_, when the\r\nindividual is good-humored and pleased with all around him.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nKING LIVER AND BILE-BOUNCERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"house not made with hands\"--the human body--has, like the house\r\nmade with hands, _its_ sewer system, which is over twenty-five feet in\r\nlength. To cleanse (?) this wonderfully delicate, tortuous and extended\r\npassage-way of waste material, civilized man knows no better than to\r\nput in at the top of the house, purgatives, cathartics, bile-bouncers,\r\netc., with one hope and purpose in view, namely, that these policemen\r\ngo searching, scouring and hustling the intestines in the greatest\r\npossible haste, in order to remove an obstruction about three hundred\r\ninches distant from where these \"forcers\" had entered the intestinal\r\nsewer. With mercury as a scavenger the work is pretty thoroughly done,\r\nthough extra care has to be taken that some of the teeth may remain\r\nafter the victim survives the additional intestinal inflammation\r\noccasioned by its drastic measures.\r\n\r\nTraits acquired by the father are inherited by the children;\r\npresent-day doctors follow early practitioners; they still pour in many\r\nand various decoctions at the top of the obstructed sewer of the human\r\nhouse to dislodge accumulated gases and feces at the bottom. The\r\nplumber treats the sewer of the house of brick and stone more wisely.\r\n\r\nOur fathers partook of laxatives, cathartics, purgatives, and in\r\nconsequence we start in life with teeth, intestines, appendices, out of\r\ngear and nervous systems on edge. With unconscious stupidity we\r\ncontinue the fatuous practice. The monarch selected to preside over the\r\nfunctions of human life was the Liver; and it is only with bated breath\r\nthat any doctor dares question the legitimacy of that monarch's claim.\r\nThe loyal subjects of King Liver are ever ready to call out \"quack,\"\r\n\"charlatan,\" etc., to those who dare repudiate the sovereignty of the\r\nLiver.\r\n\r\nSo much attention and flirtation does the liver receive from the\r\n_liver-persuaders_ that the pancreas ought to be very jealous. The\r\npancreas excretes quite as much fluid into the duodenum as its larger\r\nneighbor, and is, therefore, no mean organ. And we need not wonder\r\nshould we find the intestinal glands piqued at our over-attention to\r\nthe liver, as they, in their work at the metamorphosis of digested food\r\ninto blood, excrete two or three gallons of fluid in a day to the\r\nliver's two or three pints; yet witness our medieval solicitude for the\r\nliver, for one among many organs. The liver is located near the upper\r\nportion of the intestinal canal and connected by a tube (the bile duct)\r\nto the rest of the excursion route. The following liver-persuading\r\nknights-errant are prescribed and ordered by disciples of Hippocrates,\r\nGalen, Herodicus, and Iccus, to treat with that digestive and\r\neliminative monarch, the Liver--usually at night-time, that the family\r\nmay not be disturbed. After making as good terms as possible they\r\njourney on, riotously churning and swashing the long, tortuous canal\r\nand its contents in search of ancient toxic gases and feces lodged in\r\nthe lower bowel. It is believed by the prescribers that the length of\r\nthe journey adds dignity to the drastic, dredging knights-errant. The\r\nreader needs no introduction to the podophyllins, the aloes, the\r\njalaps, the rhubarbs, the mercurys, the croton oils, the sennas, the\r\nsalines, the seltzers, the Carters, the Beechams, the Websters, the\r\nPierces, the Ayers, the Ripans, the Warners, and others belonging to\r\n\"The Four Hundred\" fashionable grenadiers, with their credentials and\r\nstamp!\r\n\r\nAfter these knights-errant have paid their respects to King Liver, and\r\nended their long, tortuous and eventful journey, they depart and leave\r\nbehind them burning and painful abdominal and anal regrets, and then\r\nsome soothing, stimulating and tonic remedies are in order, so that the\r\ndredged though chronically constipated sufferer and his friends may\r\nstill hope that life will be spared to repeat the same nauseating and\r\noften painful process in a few days or weeks, taking, in the meanwhile,\r\nmilder bile-bouncers daily as a reminder to King Liver that the time\r\nfor the knights-errant is coming again.\r\n\r\nSufferers from chronic constipation receive assurances that by the use\r\nof these \"remedies\" the anemia will be corrected, nutrition and\r\ndigestion restored, atony of the liver and intestines overcome, yellow\r\ncomplexion and morbid feeling disappear. In short, remove the numerous\r\nsymptoms and \"causes\" of toxicity of the body and of chronic\r\nconstipation, and proclaim the victory of Powder and Pill!\r\n\r\nAll of us would believe Medicus, the son who so abjectly follows in the\r\nfootsteps of his father, if we could really feel the possibility of\r\nsuch a victory; but the protests of our bowels are living witnesses\r\nagainst the validity of the medieval practice as here described; and we\r\nask for a modern scientific solution of the fulness and foulness within\r\nand the fatuity without.\r\n\r\nI must now apologize to the large class of sufferers from chronic\r\nconstipation for hurting their feelings. I know very well how seriously\r\nthey have been compelled to regard their trouble, and out of respect\r\nfor their protracted suffering and efforts to get relief I should\r\ninstead have sympathized and condoled with them in their dire\r\nmisfortune. But we all know and realize that there are occasions when\r\nwe get into awful and painful predicaments, and, when the whole\r\nsituation is taken in, it becomes comical and ridiculous, so that for a\r\ntime we cannot treat it seriously, even when old Chronic Biliousness\r\nand the mighty knights-errant are having a deadly combat at our\r\ninternal and external (and possibly infernal) expense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nSEMI-CONSTIPATION AND ITS DANGERS.\r\n\r\n    \"At least six times in every fleeting day\r\n    Some tribute to the renal functions pay,\r\n    And twice or thrice all alvine calls obey.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat has been said thus far has been based on chronic constipation\r\nmainly, and the accompanying intestinal foulness, which condition was\r\nshown to be so annoying that it compelled the sufferer to resort\r\nfrequently to some more or less direct and artificial means for the\r\nrelief of the bowels and the incidental indigestion. It has been\r\nfurther shown that many of the chronic cases fail to take on the normal\r\namount of flesh or lose what flesh they have because of self-poisoning\r\n(auto-infection), which in turn is the outcome of mal-assimilation and\r\nmal-nutrition, and that this consequence must occur wherever there is\r\nan absorption of waste through a checking or disturbance of systemic\r\nfunctions. Emaciation and anemia are inevitable in such cases. On the\r\nother hand, there are cases that have such great powers of assimilation\r\nand elimination that they are able to stand the invasion of destructive\r\nmaterial, may maintain the normal amount of flesh, or even take on an\r\nabnormal amount, but with the invariable accompaniment of more or less\r\nimpoverishment of blood, disturbed circulation, indigestion, and the\r\nusual nervous derangements. The harmful practice of the lean and the\r\nfleshy sufferers of resorting to daily medicines--cathartics,\r\ndigestives and tonics--has been commented upon. Willingly do they\r\nsquander their money to get relief from an ever-present ailment. Cases\r\nare these of hope deferred that maketh the heart sick.\r\n\r\nThe primary cause of chronic constipation, namely, proctitis, has been\r\nexplained, and its many symptoms, as indicated by the functional\r\ndisturbances of many or all of the organs of the body, enumerated.\r\n\r\nBut beside the cases of chronic constipation--both lean and fat--there\r\nare many sufferers from auto-infection who have only semi-constipation,\r\nor partial evacuation of the feces daily. Though they suffer from the\r\neffects of self-poisoning, yet they have no such well-defined symptoms\r\nof local disease and functional disturbance as are always found in\r\nthose who have chronic constipation. Nevertheless, they have\r\ndisturbances of practically all the functions of the system. Believing\r\nas they do that the evacuation of their bowels is complete, they are at\r\na loss to find a cause for the toxemia (blood-poisoning),\r\nmal-nutrition, debility and general atony. The symptoms of\r\nauto-infection with the semi-constipated are as complex as with the\r\nseverer cases, but not so well defined. The most prominent symptoms are\r\nthose connected with the process of katabolism, that is, of\r\ndegeneration of the tissues, as indicated by their color and texture.\r\nThe liver, however, is usually held responsible for the bad complexion,\r\nimpaired nutrition, constipation and diminished vitality, when really\r\nthe liver is only indirectly concerned, as made manifest in the\r\nprevious articles. The seat and source are found to be the diseased\r\ncolon and rectum.\r\n\r\n    Dr. Treves says: \"The colon being the part of the bowel involved in\r\n    obstruction due to fecal accumulation, it may be further assumed\r\n    that the blocking of the gut will most usually concern its lower or\r\n    terminal parts. Accumulation of feces is most common in the rectum\r\n    and sigmoid flexure, and then in the cecum. Masses of feces may\r\n    block the colon at any point, and more particularly at the flexures\r\n    of the bowel. Still, the three common sites of the accumulation are\r\n    those just named. The accumulation in the colon may assume the form\r\n    of a more or less isolated nodule or mass. Thus a considerable lump\r\n    may be found in the cecum or sigmoid flexure and the rest of the\r\n    colon be comparatively clear of any gross accumulation. An isolated\r\n    lump may even persist after free purgation. On the other hand, the\r\n    accumulation may assume the form of several isolated fecal masses.\r\n    One of them may occupy the cecum, another the transverse colon, and\r\n    possibly a third the sigmoid flexure. The bowel between these\r\n    masses may appear to be fairly clear.\"\r\n\r\nA number of the exciting causes of inflammation of the lower or\r\nterminal portion of the large intestine have been mentioned. It cannot,\r\nhowever, be too strongly emphasized that chronic inflammation of the\r\ncolon and rectum results in hyperkinesis (excessive muscular\r\nirritability) and contraction of the diseased portion invaded, thereby\r\nretarding or preventing the passage of feces and gases. A portion of\r\nthe daily accumulation of feces in the sigmoid may pass through the\r\ndiseased rectum every day, but not without increasing the inflammation\r\nand the spasmodic contraction; this in time inhibits the elimination of\r\nthe accumulating feces, which by undue retention become condensed and\r\nhardened. Each day will then be a repetition of the abnormal and\r\npartial effort of the organ to accomplish the act of defecation, and\r\nthere will be no thought of the cumulative and chronic intoxication\r\n(poisoning) of the system from the imprisoned feces and gases.\r\n\r\nIt may be stated without reservation that the rectal canal cannot be\r\ninvolved in chronic inflammation without involving the anal canal, and\r\n_vice versa_. One half of civilized people are suffering from chronic\r\nconstipation, and very nearly the remainder from semi-constipation. The\r\nsemi-constipated are now under consideration. The chronic cases are\r\nthose that have a _complete_ impaction of feces in the terminal portion\r\nof the sigmoid and rectum; the semi-constipated have the usual daily\r\n_partial_ impaction, that is, an incomplete or partially successful\r\nevacuation of the contents of the bowels: the incompleteness is due to\r\ndisease of the anal and rectal canals.\r\n\r\nThe anal and rectal canals are made up of circular and longitudinal\r\nmuscular bands, which, when invaded by disease, lose their proper or\r\nnormal sensibility and coöperative voluntary action. The excessive\r\ncontraction of the circular muscles closes the calibre or bore of the\r\ngut, and the excessive contraction of the longitudinal muscles shortens\r\nthe length of the gut, thus throwing the mucous membrane into abnormal\r\nfolds which increase the depth of the sacculi, or cavities, between the\r\nfibrous folds. In the normal gut the sacculi and bands act as valves to\r\ncontrol the descent of the feces. This valvular arrangement and the\r\ncurvatures of the lower bowels conserve the energy of the involuntary\r\nand voluntary nerve force until there is a sufficient accumulation of\r\nfeces to excite a normal desire for stool; otherwise the feces would\r\nrush upon the anus at once and occasion much inconvenience.\r\n\r\nCatarrhal inflammation of the mucous membrane of the anal canal will\r\nsooner or later penetrate the muscular structure of that canal, causing\r\nan abnormal irritability and contraction of the sphincter ani and the\r\nother tissues composing its structure. The contraction of the anal\r\ntissues becomes more permanent as the muscular tissues of the structure\r\nbecome cohered or bound together by the process of inflammation.\r\n\r\nThe normal stimulus and sensation that should precede the act of\r\ndefecation are perverted or destroyed by the excessively irritable\r\ncontraction of the sphincter ani, which contraction is occasioned by\r\nthe presence of feces and gases just above the seat of inflammation,\r\nthat is, above the anal canal or at the lower end of the rectum. As the\r\nbulk of feces and gases lodged at this point increases, the anal\r\ncontraction becomes firmer in grip, and as a consequence permits no\r\nhint of the imprisoned contents until the accumulating bulk is beyond\r\nthe power of toleration by the organ. Daily a portion of the lodged\r\nfeces, or some new addition to the mass, passes the anal canal, but the\r\nattending irritation or contraction of the muscles prevents any further\r\nexit of the imprisoned rectal contents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTHE ETIOLOGY OF THE MOST COMMON FORM OF DIARRHEA, i.e., EXCESSIVE\r\nINTESTINAL PERISTALSIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you are interested to know why a certain plant does not flourish in\r\nthe temperature and light to which it has been accustomed, you\r\ninvestigate the soil--the source of nourishment--and thus determine why\r\nthe downy or velvety appearance has left the flower; why the leaves are\r\nyellow, dry or falling; why the stems are withering. Even the most\r\nignorant person knows that the symptoms the plant presents did not\r\nbring about the unsuitableness of the soil; that, on the contrary, the\r\ncondition of the soil is responsible for the plant's present state.\r\nWould it not be unwisdom, therefore, to treat directly the symptoms of\r\ndecay, instead of treating the soil, or changing it? Just so misguided\r\nis the judgment of the physician who prescribes physic or tonics in the\r\ncase of a person having a foul intestinal canal, a condition\r\ndestructive of the absorbent and the excretory glands. But members of\r\ncounty medical societies do just such foolish things. Notwithstanding\r\ntheir prescriptions, a point will be reached by the patient where the\r\nrestoration of his millions of small rootlets, or organic feeders, will\r\nbe impossible, and like a decaying plant in unfavorable soil he\r\ngradually decays or withers, here and there, until finally he topples\r\nover before he knows it, probably long before maturity has been\r\nreached.\r\n\r\nIt is not generally known among laymen, nor sufficiently appreciated\r\namong physicians, that the mass of fecal matter normally evacuated from\r\nthe bowels comes mainly from the blood; and that this mass is not, as\r\nit is usually supposed to be, the residue of the food that has been\r\nleft unassimilated. Embedded in the mucous membrane of the colon are\r\ntubular glands under the control of the nervous system. When these\r\nglands become unduly excited through local inflammation and irritation,\r\nthe normal flow from them is increased to such an extent that a rapid\r\nwaste of precious tissue occurs throughout the system, and the vital\r\nforce--which had taken perhaps years to store--is depleted to the point\r\nof exhaustion, sometimes even in a few hours. Almost every one has had\r\nsome experience of exhaustion following diarrhea.\r\n\r\nThe increased flow of blood to the mucous membrane of the colon\r\nfurthers this extraordinary secretion by the glands. As has been\r\npointed out, inflammation, septic poisoning, intestinal foulness, or\r\nretained feces, act as irritants on the mucous membranes, thereby\r\ndrawing the blood to the colon where it is excreted and exhaustion\r\nfollows. The great danger in diarrhea, therefore, is the rapid\r\ndepletion of the vital force. But when the small intestines are\r\naffected the consequences may be still more deplorable. Then the\r\nunassimilated food is hurried along too quickly for absorption and the\r\nbody receives but little nourishment to restore its powers. Thus\r\nanother draught is made upon the sufferer's reservoir of vitality, and\r\nhence additional exhaustion. But this waste of tissue, loss of vital\r\nforce, non-assimilation and non-supply, are not so grave as the\r\npositive danger of the permanent destruction of the millions of small\r\nabsorbing vessels (villi) of the small intestine by a continuance of\r\nthis abnormal irritation. Of course the secretory and excretory glands\r\nof the colon also suffer, and we then have costiveness resulting from\r\nlack of absorption and excretion.\r\n\r\nAbnormal irritability of the bowels is necessarily involved in the\r\ninflammatory process known as proctitis and colitis. Increase this\r\nirritability to a certain point and diarrhea takes the place of\r\nconstipation--a much more alarming symptom. Diarrhea is more alarming\r\nbecause the intensified local activity of the excretory glands of the\r\nbowels brings on, as has been said, a general exhaustion of the vital\r\npowers.\r\n\r\nThe severity of diarrheal symptoms is much increased by the character\r\nand abundance of bacterial poisons. Bacteria find a ready medium in\r\nfetid feces, and are absorbed by the excited glands to the degree in\r\nwhich these glands have time and power for absorption. Of course the\r\nextent and character of the intestinal irritation have a good deal to\r\ndo with the severity of the diarrheal symptoms. This irritation is not\r\ninfrequently intensified by a catarrhal process, or by a lesion of an\r\nulcerative nature. All these forms of irritation bring on \"excessive\r\nintestinal peristalsis\"--which, accordingly, is our definition of\r\ndiarrhea. The normal peristaltic action of the intestines propels the\r\nnutritive as well as the effete material through the canal at a rate\r\nthat allows of both proper absorption and timely elimination. But when\r\nexcessive peristalsis occurs, neither absorption nor elimination will\r\nbe normal or suited to the requirements of the system.\r\n\r\nUndigested foodstuffs may become an irritant, or increase, as is\r\nusually the case, the established irritation, and thus bring on an\r\nacute attack of diarrhea. The immediate consequence of the acute attack\r\nmay indeed be, and often is, comparatively beneficial, inasmuch as the\r\ndiarrhea removes the undigested material that occasioned the\r\nirritation. When this removal is accomplished, the diarrhea usually\r\nsubsides without treatment. This is the case, however, only when the\r\npatient has committed an infrequent error in diet. When such errors are\r\nhabitual the burden on the glands of the intestinal mucous membrane\r\nbecomes intolerable, and the chronic inflammation once established has\r\na tendency to proceed from bad to worse. It will then be observed that\r\ndigestion becomes more and more impaired. In such a case diarrhea will\r\nno longer serve a good end, but will on the contrary debilitate the\r\nsystem. A change to better dietetic habits will then aid, but will not\r\nsuffice for cure. Only treatment and time will restore the inflamed\r\nparts to a healthy tone. When, however, the digestive tract is invaded\r\nby any of the many forms of bacteria, treatment will avail little and\r\nserious consequences follow rapidly.\r\n\r\nToo much cannot be said or done to secure intestinal cleanliness in\r\ninfancy, childhood and maturity. Mothers and nurses cannot give this\r\nsubject too much thought and care, since the welfare of future\r\ngenerations depends largely upon intestinal cleanliness, in view of the\r\nrich and racy life of our hothouse civilization. We are a people\r\npoisoned through constipation and diarrhea: two affections that derange\r\nmore lives than all other pathological conditions together. Banish\r\nalimentary uncleanliness and you take most of the poisons from the\r\nhuman race--poisons that stunt the body and blunt the mind.\r\n\r\nThe soul of man should dwell in a palace, not in a pest-house; in a\r\nhuman temple, velvety, lined with down, inside and out; in which there\r\nare hundreds of millions of lilliputian trappings, fittings and\r\narticles of furniture, to carry on the minute and finer functions and\r\nchemistry of the soul. The very multitude of the fine equipments that\r\ndecorate the temple give it that beautiful blending of color and form\r\nwhich its coating has when in normal condition. They adorn this\r\nbody-house with health, and supply it with the rich red wine of joy.\r\n\r\nThe blood is dependent for its richness not only on the digestive\r\nfluids, but also on the proper eliminating powers of the system. If you\r\nwould avoid premature decay you must not neglect the reservoir of\r\nvitality, the alimentary canal, but see to it that it be kept clean and\r\npure. Then will the elixir of life spring from an almost inexhaustible\r\nfountain. To recur to our plant analogy. Keep the soil in your own\r\nvegetable garden sweet, for intestinal cleanliness corresponds to soil\r\nfitness. Purity of the stomach and bowels is more important than\r\nquantity or quality of food. That defecation should occur normally two\r\nor three times in twenty-four hours is more important than that three\r\nmeals should be eaten within that time. The conveniences for eating and\r\ndrinking are on every hand, but oh, how few, inaccessible, miserably\r\nconstructed, and poorly cared for, are the toilet cabinets for the\r\naccommodation of the gourmand! Suspenders and silk hats mark the\r\nprogress of our outer refinement; toilet cabinets and flushing\r\nappliances, of our inner. When the _inner_ refinement comes we shall\r\nlive longer and be healthier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nBALLOONING OF THE RECTUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make plainer what has been said of the rectal and anal tubes or\r\ncanals, consider the sleeve of an infant's gown. This sleeve well\r\nrepresents the rectal tube, the wrist-band the anal orifice and\r\ntube--an inch or more long. Think of the sleeve or rectal tube as being\r\nmade up of four layers of material or membranes; and counting from the\r\ninside of the sleeve or rectum there are (1) the mucous layer; (2) the\r\nareolar layer; (3) the muscular layer; (4) the serous layer.\r\n\r\nThe muscular membrane is itself composed of two layers, and may be said\r\nto form the framework of the rectum. One layer is composed of circular\r\nmuscular fibres, and the other of longitudinal muscular fibres. In a\r\nsimilar manner you could make a sleeve out of fine circular rubber\r\nbands; then bind them together by rubber strings extending lengthwise\r\nof the sleeve. With the circular bands the bore of the sleeve may be\r\ncontracted or widened; and with the longitudinal bands the length may\r\nbe shortened or extended. Just so with the corresponding muscular\r\nmembranes of the rectum, in their normal and abnormal conditions.\r\nOutside of the longitudinal muscular bands are the serous and areolar\r\nlayers, the latter covering the lower half of the rectum.\r\n\r\nAs you look inside the incomplete model of the rectum, or rather\r\nsleeve, you observe circular muscular bands or fibres which it is\r\nnecessary to cover with soft spongy or fatty substance in whose meshes\r\nare nerves, blood-vessels, etc. This is called the areolar layer or\r\ncoat. One more layer or coat upon this--the mucous coat--completes the\r\nstructure. This latter possesses the power of accommodating itself to\r\nthe distention and contraction of the muscular tube. The mucous\r\nmembrane is thrown into folds and columns which serve as valves to\r\ninhibit the undue descent of the feces, thus assisting the mucous\r\nmembrane in performing its office.\r\n\r\nThe length of the rectum varies in different persons, six inches is the\r\naverage length. It is divided into two parts. The upper part is a\r\nlittle more than three inches long; beginning in front of the third\r\nsacral vertebra and extending down to the end or tip of the coccyx. In\r\nshape this part conforms to the curve of the sacrum and the coccyx, to\r\nwhich it is attached behind. The lower part of the rectum is a little\r\nshorter than the upper part, and begins at the tip of the coccyx and\r\nextends down with the same curve as the upper part, terminating at the\r\nupper portion of the anal canal.\r\n\r\nReturning to the sleeve again; the portion of it from the shoulder to\r\nthe elbow illustrates the upper part of the rectum when partially\r\ncovered with a serous coat on the side opposite the bore (the outside).\r\nFrom the elbow to the wrist-band illustrates the lower part of the\r\nrectum, when covered on the outside with an areolar coat.\r\n\r\nThe wrist-band of the sleeve will represent the anal tube if drawn into\r\na pucker and turned slightly backward from the direction of the sleeve\r\nof which it is a continuation.\r\n\r\nThe muscular fibres described above likewise enter into the formation\r\nof the anal canal or orifice. This orifice is closed by two strong\r\nmuscles that lie close together and are called internal and external\r\nsphincters, which are abundantly supplied with nerves and blood-vessels\r\nwhose branches extend to the neighboring organs.\r\n\r\nNine persons in every ten have more or less chronic inflammation of the\r\nmucous membrane of the anus and rectum. In time the areolar and\r\nmuscular coats become invaded by the morbid process, and this increases\r\nthe irritability of the tissues of the organ.\r\n\r\nThe change from the normal functions of the anal membranes is slow, and\r\nthe symptoms are not well marked and are consequently ignored for years\r\nowing to inexpertness in detecting an invading serious disease, until\r\nthe time comes when the suffering can no longer be tolerated by the\r\nvictim of the neglect.\r\n\r\nThe result of disease to muscular tissue is contraction of its fibres,\r\nand the contractions become more painful as the disease increases.\r\nAccompanying the inflammation, there is a more or less inflammatory\r\nproduct secreted between muscular fibres that \"glues\" them together in\r\ntheir contracted state. And as the anal and rectal tubes are made up of\r\nround muscular fibres, it is not hard to see how the bore of the canal\r\ncan be lessened by the slow binding together of its fibres in the\r\ncontracted state. The fact is that when the anal structure is invaded\r\nby inflammation, there is more or less stricture of the canal and of\r\nthe orifice.\r\n\r\nRecalling the sleeve illustration, and how the wrist-band was puckered\r\nand bent back a trifle so that the contents of the sleeve would not\r\npass out so easily, suppose you now pucker the wrist-band rather\r\ntightly, and suppose there is a forcible descent of sand in the sleeve,\r\nthe natural result would be a bulging out of the lower portion of the\r\nsleeve just above the wrist-band, or place of undue constriction. If\r\nthe abnormally constricted condition of the anal orifice has been\r\ngrowing from bad to worse for years, the locality immediately above the\r\nanal canal will become dilated or cavernous (caused by retained feces\r\nor gases), which cavity is called ballooning of the rectum. When a\r\nspeculum is introduced into the rectum (as shown on page 14 of pamphlet\r\n_How to Become Strong_), and through it a bent probe is inserted to\r\ndetermine the depth of the dilatation or abnormal cavity, it is as if\r\none were poking inside of an inflated balloon: hence the name.\r\n\r\nAnatomists describe the rectum as terminating in a forward pouch, which\r\nis close to the prostate gland in the male and the lower part of the\r\nvagina in the female. In some cases there may be such a slight pouch,\r\ndue to the anal canal not following the direction of the rectum, and\r\nslightly turning backward; but in most cases such a normal pouch is not\r\nperceptible or observed through the speculum. The small pouch sometimes\r\nfound on the anterior wall of the rectum I have thought due to a very\r\nacute inflammation on the verge of forming abscess, which often occurs\r\nin the triangular space. (See 4 in diagram in pamphlet cited above.)\r\n\r\nImmediately above the sphincter muscles on the posterior wall of the\r\nrectum the greatest dilatation is found (as shown by the bent probe),\r\nand extends on each side with less depth about the anterior wall of the\r\nrectum.\r\n\r\nThe greater portion of the lower part of the rectum, which part is\r\nabout three inches long, is usually involved in the dilatation or\r\nballooning. Often the upper half or more of the anal canal is also\r\ndilated with the rectum, leaving the sphincter muscles quite bare of\r\nfatty tissue, with anal length of a quarter of an inch or less.\r\n\r\nYour attention was called to a sleeve containing sand, and the bulging\r\nor dilatation above the puckered wrist-band that was an inch or more\r\nbroad. Now suppose there were two strong rubber rings at the lower end\r\nof the wrist-band, whose power of resistance to pressure is much\r\ngreater than the tissues above them forming the wrist-band. Naturally,\r\nthe tissues which form the upper part of the wrist-band would dilate\r\nthe same as the terminal portion of the sleeve just above the\r\nwrist-band.\r\n\r\nSimilar changes in structure or formation take place in diseases of the\r\nanal and rectal canals which result in ballooning of the rectum; and\r\ntwo frail constricted sphincter muscles are left to guard this balloon,\r\nfilled, as it so often is, with feces and gas.\r\n\r\nChronic inflammation, that results in contraction of the circular\r\nmuscular fibres, will sooner or later constrict the gut so that it will\r\nlose its normal power to expand without causing pain. The anal canal\r\nmay be said to be strictured to the degree in which it is unable to\r\ndilate normally, and this strictured condition usually grows from bad\r\nto worse.\r\n\r\nThe first symptom of rectal disease is usually an affection of the\r\nanus, which affection occasions an inhibition, that is, a reluctant\r\npermission for the passage of the feces; and this inhibition results,\r\nconsequently, in some degree of constipation. And this constipation\r\nreacts more or less on the peristaltic action of the bowels and in time\r\ndefeats the function of peristalsis. All this will react on the\r\ninflammatory processes at the anus, which originally engendered the\r\nconstipation. The narrow and contracted strait or canal through which\r\nthe feces must pass, gives a tape-like shape to the stools.\r\n\r\nThe anal and rectal mucous membrane is of a firm and tough structure,\r\nsimilar to the integument at the bottom of a boy's heel. After many\r\nyears' observation of diseases of the anus and rectum I am forced to\r\nconclude that as a rule inflammation exists in the tissues twenty or\r\nmore years before the severe symptoms, such as piles, fissure, anal\r\npockets, pruritus, hypertrophy, atrophy, tabs, abscesses, and fistula,\r\nare sufficiently annoying to compel the sufferer to seek medical aid. I\r\nbelieve it to be of as much importance to give early attention to\r\ndisease of the anus and rectum as to teeth and eyes, or even more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nBALLOONING OF THE RECTUM--Continued.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter a description was given of the anatomy of the anus\r\nand rectum; and it was shown how a chronic inflammatory process\r\ninvolving these organs develops stricture in the parts invaded; and it\r\nwas shown how a partial stricture of the anal canal results in\r\nballooning or dilatation of the lower part of the rectum. The primary\r\ncause of all the symptoms of rectal disease is chronic inflammation\r\n(proctitis) involving the whole structure of the anal tubes and in a\r\nfew cases the sigmoid flexure as well.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the first marked symptom of disease of the rectum is\r\nconstipation, semi-constipation or of chronic character. The function\r\nof the anus and rectum being disturbed by the inflammation, the fecal\r\nmass is unduly retained and its moisture is absorbed by the system.\r\nThis accounts for the condensed and hardened fecal mass in isolated\r\nlumps of various proportions. A hard-formed stool is abnormal, and is\r\nevidence of auto-infection. When three-fourths of the normal fecal mass\r\nhas been re-absorbed by the system, does it not stand to reason that\r\nthe blood and tissues have been poisoned by their own waste products\r\n(auto-intoxication) and that anemia, emaciation and local disturbances\r\nof other organs of the body are symptoms of such intoxication?\r\n\r\nThe loading and blocking of the sigmoid flexure come from _too much\r\nactivity or irritability, due to inflammation, of the upper half of the\r\nrectal tube_. A consequence of this excessive sensitiveness is a\r\ndiminished or perverted normal stimulus, notice or desire, that the act\r\nof defecation should take place.\r\n\r\nThe victim of proctitis simply forms a habit of daily soliciting an\r\nevacuation, though the normal invitation or desire to stool may be\r\nentirely absent, and the evacuation in such cases is attended with more\r\nor less delay and straining effort to accomplish partially or wholly\r\nthe expulsion of the more or less inspissated feces.\r\n\r\nAs the extreme sensitiveness of the inflamed upper half of the rectum\r\noffers resistance to the passage of the fecal contents of the sigmoid\r\nflexure; so, in a somewhat similar manner, the inflamed anal tube, in\r\nits more or less constricted state, prevents the passage of feces and\r\ngases as they approach the terminal part of the rectum. As a\r\nconsequence, the feces and gas deposit and lodge at this latter\r\nlocation, producing in so doing the abnormal cavity called ballooning\r\nof the rectum, so often found just above the anal tube.\r\n\r\nThe greatest depth of the dilated pouch is on the posterior wall of the\r\nrectum, or just in front of the tip of the coccyx. In some cases the\r\npouch measures two and a half inches in depth at the back and gradually\r\ndiminishes in depth on each side as you near the anterior wall of the\r\nrectum. Often the upper end of the anal canal is higher than the\r\ndepressed circumference of the spacious cavity that almost surrounds\r\nit. The irritable orifice of the cavity will invariably compel a\r\nquantity of liquids and feces to lodge in the cavity as a permanent\r\ncesspool, allowing the absorbent vessels to absorb as much as they can\r\nby incessant work. The height or length of this abnormal cone-shaped\r\nrectal cavity is from two to three inches, involving usually the lower\r\nhalf of the rectum. The anal canal frequently becomes shortened by the\r\ndilating process to a quarter of an inch, leaving two frail, irritable\r\nmuscles at the vent, to guard the rectal cavity. And fortunate are\r\nthese two thin, sore, contracted muscles, and the possessor of them, if\r\nthey escape the surgeon's barbarous notion of operating on them.\r\n\r\nIf the medical butcher has operated on them, you will find an anal\r\ncanal open to such an extent that two fingers can be inserted without\r\ndistending the tissues in the least. And when the victim of ballooning\r\nof the rectum and ignorant operation makes further complaint to the\r\nsurgeon of the aches and pains, he is consoled by being informed that\r\nthe end of the spine will have to be removed. Irreparable damage done\r\nand no aid at all received! It is a pity such ignorance on the subject\r\nshould exist in the medical profession in this city.\r\n\r\nThe abnormal cavity, so difficult to empty properly owing to its depth\r\nand diseased outlet, is seldom free from gases, feces and liquids.\r\nDaily evacuations will not empty this cavity, nor will cathartics or\r\ndiarrhea. A permanent cesspool of poisons is this, where all forms of\r\npoisonous germs are propagated, and infect the system by absorption. No\r\nuse to take medicines for your _poor blood, bad complexion and horrid\r\nfeelings_, as they will not cleanse the augean stable so long\r\nneglected. No use to journey to other localities for health so long as\r\nyou carry so formidable a foe to health with you.\r\n\r\nThe mucous membrane in the chronic state of the disease presents a\r\nrather dry, indolent and bluish appearance, except that here and there\r\nthe tissues show more activity of the disease, more especially so over\r\nthe anal region, due to harsher disturbance during the act of stooling.\r\nIn the subacute or acute stage of the inflammatory process there is\r\nmore general redness and puffiness of the mucous membrane, or a swollen\r\ncondition with increased discharge of mucus and perhaps some blood.\r\n\r\nThere is a heavy, uncomfortable feeling, with more or less soreness and\r\npain, especially after evacuation of the feces. If a fissure or anal\r\nulcer is present the pain is in proportion to its size and the general\r\naggravation of all the diseased parts. Itching or pruritus about the\r\nanus may accompany the trouble to a very annoying extent, being an\r\nevidence that the anal pockets are becoming much diseased. The\r\npartially constricted and irritable sphincter muscles become excited\r\nduring the act of stooling and react on the anal grip or contraction,\r\nmaking it more intense. This latter condition may shut off the flow of\r\nblood in a local vein; and the blood becoming coagulated forms a\r\npainful bluish grape-like tumor at the external opening of the anus.\r\n\r\nAbscesses may form at some portion of the diseased gut and result in an\r\nexternal fistula.\r\n\r\nPiles may co-exist in some cases of ballooning, but are usually not\r\nannoying.\r\n\r\nIt is the local anal or external annoyances that compel the sufferer to\r\nseek medical advice and aid, and he learns that the troubles complained\r\nof are only symptoms of a chronic disease, therefore easily removed\r\nwithout harsh treatment while the cause is being properly cured.\r\n\r\nIt is very fortunate for the sufferer from ballooning of the rectum to\r\nhave in or near the anal canal those painful hints or symptoms of a\r\nvery grave and long existing disease whose constitutional symptoms were\r\nwell marked but attributed to other causes, especially to disease of the\r\nliver--an organ of _so much solicitude_ that the poor liver-worshipping\r\npatient ought to receive more gracious response from it.\r\n\r\nIn every case of chronic proctitis, or inflammation of the anus and\r\nrectum, the sigmoid flexure must be more or less dilated, as the upper\r\npart of the rectum is very irritable and contracted and inhibits the\r\nfeces from passing beyond the sigmoid; but this irritability and\r\ncontraction of the rectum, as a rule, is not nearly so severe as that\r\nof the anal canal, whose orifice is closed by very strong sphincter\r\nmuscles.\r\n\r\nSuch being the pathological change in the sigmoid flexure and\r\nespecially in the lower portion of the rectum, as described in these\r\ntwo chapters, who, with ordinary intelligence and an idea of\r\ncleanliness, would take or prescribe remedies to move the bowels, if it\r\nwere possible to cleanse the foul capacious cavities with water? We\r\nknow that they can be thus cleansed, and that it can be easily\r\naccomplished with benefit to the diseased canals.\r\n\r\nAfter the system has absorbed 75 per cent of the fecal mass, a \"remedy\"\r\nis taken to excite a flow of watery excretions into the bowels, of\r\nwhich a portion will be retained in the colon, and especially the\r\nballooned cavities, and reabsorbed; and every day the objectionable\r\npractice is repeated without any thought of the harm being done.\r\n\r\nThe flushing of the rectum, sigmoid flexure and colon with water is not\r\na _cure-all_, but it is one of the means of treating a grave chronic\r\ndisease, a disease insidious and far-reaching in its poisonous effects\r\non the human organism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nTHE USUAL DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF BOWEL TROUBLES WRONG.\r\n\r\n\r\nHerodotus tells us that among certain tribes when a man fell sick his\r\nnext-door neighbor did not wait for him to become thin but killed him\r\nat once, lest by the loss of his adipose his flesh might be rendered\r\nless appetizing.\r\n\r\nBut alas! in this age of constipation and piles, of self-generated\r\npoisons and self-infection, how changed is the custom! Our next-door\r\nneighbor, the doctor, waits till we are really thin, and then begins to\r\nfeed and grow fat on our ills! In our day, through the continuous\r\nprocess of self-poisoning we take on no flesh from puny, peaked\r\nchildhood, or we insidiously lose what little flesh we had, and when\r\nour bones are well exposed, become alarmed, realize that we are sick,\r\nrush for the doctor, and dispossess ourselves of our spare cash.\r\n\r\nVery frequently, as stated in the first chapter, auto-infection begins\r\nin infancy and slowly but steadily progresses, but it may not be before\r\nadult age is reached and one or more organs are seriously diseased that\r\nit becomes apparent to all. The vital round of the alternate\r\nbuilding-up and breaking-down of the system has been going on\r\nunceasingly during these years of increasing infection, but prematurely\r\nthe balance between up and down is lost in favor of down; the\r\nbuilding-up process becoming feebler, slower, and the breaking-down\r\nprocess quicker, easier. What can the inevitable outcome be but\r\n_emaciation_ and _anemia_, and all their attendant suffering and\r\nconsequences? It is the superabundance of vitality in the growing child\r\nthat retards (inhibits) the morbid changes going on in the blood and\r\ntissues of the system; but the process is all the more insidious by\r\nbeing thus restrained, and its very subtlety and stealth beguile us all\r\ninto fancied security: parents, friends, physicians--all are deceived.\r\n\r\nAs stated in a previous chapter, the first unwelcome visitor, in\r\ninfancy, is inflammation of the integument and mucous membrane of the\r\nanal orifice, invited by the uncleanliness involved in the use of\r\ndiapers; and this visitor takes up its residence slowly along several\r\ninches of the lower bowel. Its first symptoms are likely to be\r\nconstipation, flatulency, colic, indigestion, bacterial and other\r\npoisons, occasionally diarrhea, and the usual general disturbance of\r\nthe system as above detailed. It is admitted by all authors that\r\ninflammation of the anus, rectum, etc., is by far the most common\r\ndisease that afflicts mankind at all ages; and I maintain that the\r\nnatural result of such inflammation is a more or less extensive\r\nocclusion of the lower bowel, which in turn involves an undue retention\r\nof the feces, and thus we have the foul intestinal canal and stomach\r\ncalled gastric and intestinal indigestion.\r\n\r\nThe wrong treatment of constipation, diarrhea, indigestion and\r\nauto-intoxication up to the present time has been due to improper\r\ndiagnosis. Writers on these subjects speak of them as causes when they\r\nare merely symptoms. And the remedies for these \"causes\" are even more\r\nnumerous. _Mistaken diagnosis on the one hand, measured doses on the\r\nother, and there you have the scientific doctor!_ The primary cause,\r\ninflammation, like the original spark applied to dry shavings, sets up\r\nmorbid changes in the various parts of the digestive canal and the\r\nother organs of the body, and these \"set up\" or established changes are\r\nproperly secondary or derivative causes accompanied by their own\r\nsymptoms. The primary disease and symptoms may exist for five, ten,\r\ntwenty or more years before any pronounced secondary or derivative\r\ndiseases and their symptoms occur or are noticeable to a sufficiently\r\nmarked degree.\r\n\r\nThe chronic character of the malady, and the complication of primary\r\nwith secondary diseases and their symptoms, have thoroughly\r\ndisconcerted the doctors. Hence the many \"causes\" assigned for\r\nindigestion, constipation, etc., and the many kinds of remedies\r\nprescribed with the one sure result, FAILURE; and hence, also, not a\r\nfew of the self- and drug-intoxicated ones dubbed, or actually\r\ndeveloped into, hypochondriacs. Diagnosis wrong, treatment wrong,\r\nfailure certain, and the foulness of the intestinal canal continued!\r\nThis is the experience and testimony of the many, many sufferers from\r\nthe most common malady that afflicts humanity from infancy to old age,\r\nand which will continue to afflict the great majority until it is\r\nproperly understood and treated.\r\n\r\nWhen a sewer of a town is obstructed, the most sensible plan is to\r\nbegin the investigation at the outlet and then proceed up, section\r\nafter section, to trace the obstacle that had occasioned the\r\naccumulation of debris. When the waste-pipes of a house are clogged, we\r\ndo not expect the plumber to go to the top of the building and poke\r\nsubstances down the pipe to dislodge the unduly retained material some\r\ntwenty-five feet or more away. Nor would we believe him if he informed\r\nus that the sewer-gas and overflow of waste in the house were the\r\n_cause_ of the constipated condition of the drain. But just this is\r\nwhat the doctor declares concerning our sewer; just this is what he\r\ndoes when he doses it with laxatives, cathartics, purgatives. Such is\r\nthe treatment we receive when we rush to the doctor, or such the\r\ntreatment we give ourselves. The poor, sensitive, inflamed canal is\r\ndesecrated on all hands, though part of a house not made with hands--a\r\nhouse that should be a home for the soul of man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nCOSTIVENESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe words constipation, obstipation and costiveness are often employed\r\nas if of exactly similar meaning, but it is well to let each stand for\r\na particular condition. Obstipation implies that the canal of the\r\nintestine is stopped up or closed. Constipation carries the idea that\r\nthe canal is completely filled up with refuse matter. In the normal\r\ncondition the intestine is divided by transverse bulges or valves or\r\ndams into a number of separate segments, the entire arrangement having\r\nthe effect of preventing too rapid descent of the feces. These folds\r\nwithin the canal may become too much narrowed by disease and thus\r\nprevent the movement of the matters inside; this is obstipation.\r\nConstipation, stuffing of the gut, may be the result of neglecting the\r\ncall of nature, and after a time the ability to recognize and answer it\r\nis lost; or it may result from inflammation which itself comes from the\r\nbad habit mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe author prefers to use the term costiveness for the general debased\r\ncondition of the system from auto-intoxication depending upon proctitis\r\nand similar conditions of the intestinal tract. And it must be\r\nremembered that the same patient may have two or more of these\r\nconditions at the same time. Constipation, obstipation and diarrhea may\r\nalternate through the progress of the case.\r\n\r\nWe would expect people suffering from constipation or obstipation to\r\npass as fairly well people for a time, but the same is not true of\r\npatients having the other condition, costiveness. As we may speak of\r\nthe stages of a disease like consumption, so we may speak of these\r\nthree conditions as different stages of one affliction, the worst being\r\ncostiveness with its progressive self-poisoning by the products of\r\nintestinal decomposition. Early in the case the system may pass these\r\npoisons out of the body with comparative ease, by way of the lungs,\r\nskin and kidneys. In time the second stage begins to make itself\r\napparent, vitality becomes less and less, calling for a greater variety\r\nof medicines to correct the condition, as in the second stage of\r\nconsumption, and also to arrest the progress of emaciation and anemia\r\nor anemic obesity.\r\n\r\nThe third stage of auto-intoxication is a most unhappy one. The\r\nimpoverished tissues offer a most favorable soil for the development of\r\ndiseased conditions. These three stages which are clear to the\r\nexperienced eye of the physician may to the patient seem to be\r\nindistinguishable, the one from the other; and it must not be forgotten\r\nthat the three conditions do not mean simply that a smaller or larger\r\npart of the intestine is clogged by its contents, but that the whole\r\nsystem is involved as well.\r\n\r\nIt cannot indeed be otherwise with the rapid circulation of the blood,\r\nnor need it excite wonder that such patients are thin and debilitated\r\nby the deadening of the powers of absorption, assimilation and\r\nelimination.\r\n\r\nAs a rule the many thin and puny infants and children of either sex,\r\nwith bony points well exposed under a tightly drawn skin, which latter\r\nis clay-colored and pimply; children with headache and languor, without\r\nhealthy interest in either studies or play;--these are the victims of\r\nintestinal poisoning as described. If they have inherited a spare habit\r\nof body from their parents such bodily ills will manifest themselves\r\nthe more quickly. They ought to be fat and hearty as are the young of\r\nanimals, but alas many are not! When the young animal is spare, a few\r\ndays of rest with good diet will put flesh on it, demonstrating that\r\nthe state of the bowels and the powers of assimilation are intact. Why\r\ndoes not man take on flesh in a similar way?\r\n\r\nIf the intelligent animals could talk, they would undoubtedly make all\r\nmanner of fun of the intestinal canals which they see walking about,\r\nwith a little flesh here and there seemingly by accident, and a skin\r\nwhich is clay-colored or jaundiced, anemic or flabby, the owner of it\r\nall poisoning himself by decomposition in his intestines!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nINFLAMMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we desire to get a general idea of the changes that occur in an\r\norgan when it becomes inflamed, we must first have a knowledge of the\r\nnormal structure of that organ, even though that knowledge be but\r\nsuperficial. Taking the intestines, for example, we see under the\r\nmicroscope that they are composed of layers of different tissues,\r\ncalled connective, epithelial, muscle, and nerve tissue; the first two\r\nforming a large part of the structure.\r\n\r\nIn the connective (and fatty) tissues a great many blood-vessels are\r\nfound (varying in different parts of the organ), the existence of which\r\nis necessary for the production of inflammation, since at the very\r\noutset of the process, a discharge (or exudation) takes place from\r\nthese blood-vessels, accompanied by changes or degenerations in the\r\nother kinds of tissue.\r\n\r\nThe process of inflammation is commonly associated with symptoms of\r\nheat, redness, swelling and pain, in greater or less degree, combined\r\nwith which a change in the function of the organ is soon noticed.\r\nMicro-organisms are considered the primary cause of inflammation in\r\nmany or even in most cases in which mechanical or chemical influences\r\nmay undoubtedly be responsible primarily; and then again, each of these\r\ncauses may be either external--that is, may originate from the outside\r\nworld--or internal, that is, may be produced in and by the body itself.\r\n\r\nThe first pronounced change occurring in an organ under inflammation is\r\nan increase in the rapidity with which the blood circulates through the\r\nvessels--a so-called hyperemia--which soon gives place to a diminution\r\n(stasis) in the current together with an exudation from the\r\nblood-vessels; the latter is due to changes in the structure of their\r\nwalls. This exudation soon occasions a cloudiness of the connective\r\ntissues and at the same time a desquamation (shedding in scales) of the\r\nepithelia (cells of the thin mucous surface). An irritation of the\r\nnerves also takes place.\r\n\r\nThe varieties of inflammation can be best apprehended by considering\r\nthe different characters of the exudation. The exudation may be watery\r\n(called serous) or dense, the latter either fibrinous or albuminous.\r\nWith a serous exudation there is swelling of the connective tissue and\r\na desquamation of epithelia--the latter usually slight in\r\ncharacter--which constitutes what is known as a catarrh; while with a\r\nfibrinous or albuminous exudation there is usually more or less\r\ndestruction of the tissue itself, when, for example, we have \"croup\" or\r\n\"diphtheria.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the changes in the epithelia are only slight and secondary, it is\r\nspoken of as an interstitial (lying between) inflammation, which\r\nstrictly speaking denotes confined to connective tissue, and is\r\ntherefore a term not entirely correct. When the inflammation of the\r\nepithelia is severe and may lead to their partial destruction, it is\r\ncalled a parenchymatous inflammation; that is, one involving the soft\r\ncellular substance. There is still another variety, the suppurative,\r\nwhich is the most intense of all, and indicates the production of an\r\nabscess and the entire destruction of the tissue implicated.\r\n\r\nBeside these general grades of inflammation there are special sorts\r\nproduced by specific micro-organisms. In all general inflammation we\r\nmay expect to find such organisms, which in most cases belong to the\r\nclass of micrococci, such as staphylococci and streptococci. In\r\ngonorrhea we have a special organism called the \"gonococcus\"; while in\r\ntuberculosis--a variety of inflammation in which the blood-vessels are\r\ncompletely destroyed and a change or degeneration called \"cheesy\" is\r\nproduced, leading to the production of a tubercle--a rod-like bacillus\r\nis invariably found, the well-known and unfortunately too common\r\ntubercle bacillus. In syphilis--another special variety of\r\ninflammation--a specific micro-organism is also surely present, but of\r\nthis microbe science has not as yet discovered the exact nature.\r\n\r\nThe question of the origin of tumors or new growths is also an\r\nextremely important one; and it is undoubtedly true that many tumors\r\narise where there was a previous inflammation, this being especially\r\nthe case in tumors of the rectum. Why such a growth should arise in\r\nsome cases and not in others is as yet unknown, though microbes are\r\nheld by many to play an important rôle.\r\n\r\nWhen an inflammation has lasted for such a length of time that it has\r\nbecome chronic, a new tissue will sooner or later be produced in\r\nvarying amount; and this newly formed fibrous connective tissue may\r\nentirely replace previous normal structures. Through the exudation and\r\nconsequent changes in the normal tissue a large amount of mucus is at\r\nfirst secreted, but this secretion becomes less and less marked the\r\nmore the inflammation causes a desquamation of the epithelia.\r\nPronounced desquamation with new formation of connective tissue and no\r\nfresh exudation will, sooner or later, occasion dryness--this dryness\r\nbeing sometimes very pronounced. The longer the inflammation lasts, the\r\nseverer it will be; and the greater the amount of tissue it attacks,\r\nthe more will the normal tissue be destroyed and replaced by a new\r\nconnective tissue. A partial destruction will cause shrinkage of the\r\norgan (so-called \"cirrhosis\"); while a complete destruction of certain\r\nparts will result in what is known as \"atrophy\" (a wasting away of\r\nnormal tissue). In atrophy the blood-vessels as well as the original\r\nconnective and epithelial tissue are destroyed; while the newly formed\r\ntissue leads to hypertrophy (excessive over-growth) of other portions\r\nof the organ. Such a hypertrophy must not be confounded with an\r\ninduration that may be present later, or even at the very commencement\r\nof an inflammation, due to modification of the blood-vessels and\r\nsurrounding tissues.\r\n\r\nChronic inflammation, sooner or later, leads to secondary\r\ndegenerations, that is, new products of the protoplasm, the most common\r\nof which is fatty degeneration. In this form fat granules and globules\r\narise, which are at first minute, later on larger; these in certain\r\norgans, such as the liver, may become so pronounced as to entirely\r\nreplace the original tissue. Another degeneration--which, however, is\r\nfound only in chronic systemic disturbances, such as tuberculosis or\r\nsyphilis--is the waxy or amyloid degeneration, a peculiar chemical\r\nchange the exact nature of which is unknown.\r\n\r\nVarious chemical changes are by no means uncommon.\r\n\r\nAn important question is the decision as to the length of time an\r\ninflammation has lasted; and this at best can be determined only\r\napproximately and after long experience. The older the inflammation,\r\nthe more the connective tissue has developed; this connective tissue is\r\nat first soft, but soon becomes more and more dense; the result being a\r\nvarying degree of hardness of the organs.\r\n\r\nAgain, secondary degenerations are more pronounced in long-standing\r\nprocesses. In comparatively fresh cases blood-vessels are still more or\r\nless numerous and the tissue appears red, while in older cases these\r\nvessels become completely obliterated, and the tissues take on a white,\r\nglistening color, becoming harder and denser as the years advance. If a\r\nprocess has lasted twenty or thirty years, the changes to the eye and\r\ntouch are practically the same as after forty or sixty years.\r\n\r\nThe changes, as here described, will be the same upon any mucous\r\nmembrane; and in the large intestine can be easily studied and are\r\nperfectly characteristic.\r\n\r\nRarely does an infant escape repeated attacks of inflammation of the\r\nintegument of the anus and the mucous membrane of the anal canal. The\r\ninflamed integument is treated and healed, but no attention is given to\r\nthe inflamed mucous membrane so that the inflammation in time becomes\r\nchronic, involving the rectum also. Should the infant be so fortunate\r\nas to escape inflammation (proctitis) of these organs during the\r\nwearing of the diaper, there are numerous other exciting causes of\r\ninflammation which it will not be likely to escape, hence the almost\r\nuniversal symptom of constipation among civilized people; and hence\r\nlater in life you hear the familiar expression, \"I have a touch of the\r\npiles,\" and many other complaints of bowel ailments that are usually\r\nthe outcome of that deplorable inflammation.\r\n\r\nI have endeavored to make clear the fact that inflammation destroys\r\nnormal tissues and blood-vessels, and that the newly formed tissue is\r\ncicatricial in character, that is poor in cells and vessels, with a\r\ntendency to contraction which of course lessens the bore of the gut.\r\nWhen the hypertrophy or thickening is extensive the appearance of the\r\nmucous membrane suggests the addition of one or more thicknesses of a\r\nchamois skin added to the inner surface of the anal and rectal canals.\r\nThe hypertrophied or newly formed tissue may be limited to the rectum,\r\nleaving the anal tissues comparatively exempt from the superabundant\r\ncicatricial formation; or the hypertrophy may involve, to quite a\r\ndegree, only the anal tissues and the integument around the anal\r\norifice. The added connective tissue about the anus forms the skin into\r\ntabs, or into a circle of elongated integument around the orifice, with\r\na mucous lining. These hypertrophied tabs or folds, like pruritus ani,\r\nare symptoms of proctitis.\r\n\r\nProctitis (the inflammation of the anal and rectal canals) is the most\r\ncommon and serious disease that afflicts man. The system is not only\r\npoisoned by bacteria and filth through proctitis, but proctitis is also\r\nthe cause of the many annoying and painful local symptoms, such as\r\nhypertrophy, piles, abscess, fistula, cancer, polypus, fissure,\r\npruritus, etc.\r\n\r\nWhen the subject of proctitis is better understood by laymen they will\r\nsee to it that the rectums of children receive an examination before\r\nthe children are six years old, and thus obviate the necessity of\r\ndosing them with all sorts of medicine that follow improper diagnosis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nPROCTITIS AND PILES.\r\n\r\n\r\nPiles (hemorrhoids) are not the result of either the normal or abnormal\r\ngrowth of the tissues of the anal and rectal mucous membrane. They are\r\ndeveloped by the combination of pathological and physiological\r\nconditions: (1) chronic inflammation or proctitis; (2) stricture of the\r\nanal canal and lower portion of the rectum, which may be spasmodic, or\r\nmore or less permanent, which stricture pinches or constricts the\r\ncanal, thereby inhibiting the circulation of the blood; (3) the\r\npressure or straining effort during the act of defecation, occasioned\r\nby the constricted canal, which effort brings on greater local\r\ncongestion and constriction of the tissues.\r\n\r\nPile formations are a symptom of chronic proctitis of fifteen, twenty\r\nor more years duration. Proctitis (inflammation of the anus or rectum)\r\nand periproctitis (inflammation of the connective tissue about the\r\nrectum) are by no means uncommon inflammatory processes. The mucous\r\nmembrane like the skin is liable to injury or poisons and especially so\r\nat the orifices of the body. Let inflammation set in: if it be not\r\ncured at once, it will invade the canal, especially a canal like the\r\nrectum; in which case it will establish itself throughout from six to\r\nten inches of its length, sometimes taking in the sigmoid flexure and\r\neven the colon. Just how long chronic inflammation confines itself to\r\nthe mucous membrane before invading the areolar or lace-like connective\r\ntissue and the muscular tissue of the organ, I am unable to state.\r\n\r\nThe first symptom or indication that all the tissues are involved in\r\nthe inflammatory process will most naturally be constipation. You have\r\nobserved that inflammation of a portion of the skin on the arm, trunk\r\nor leg does not disturb the muscular movements of the region involved,\r\nexcept when the muscles underneath the skin are affected also, as in\r\nthe case of deep burns where the movements are very much disturbed by\r\nthe irritability, soreness and contraction of the diseased muscles.\r\nThere is also an adhesive product excreted from the inflamed tissue\r\nthat binds the muscular fibres of an organ together, and you have\r\ncontraction of the organ and its usefulness impaired. Now, as this is\r\nprecisely the pathological or diseased condition which chronic cases of\r\nproctitis and periproctitis present, you will readily understand how\r\nspasmodic and partial stricture or contraction occurs in the sore\r\nmuscles (circular and longitudinal) of the anus and rectum. The length\r\nand the bore of the canal are diminished, and thus the circulation of\r\nthe blood arrested by the pressure or gripping of the contracted\r\nmuscles. This congestion of the blood brings about an anatomical change\r\nin the structure of the mucous membrane, which we call piles: a mere\r\nsymptom of inflammation.\r\n\r\nMedical authors have defined inflammation as follows: \"(1) A series of\r\nchanges constituting the local reaction to injury; (2) a series of\r\nchanges that constitute the local attempt at repair of actual or\r\nreferred injury of a part; (3) a series of local phenomena that are\r\ndeveloped in consequence of primary lesion of the tissues and that tend\r\nto heal these lesions; (4) the method by which an organism attempts to\r\nrender inert the noxious elements introduced from without or arising\r\nwithin it; (5) a disturbance of the mechanism of nutrition of an organ\r\nor tissue, affecting the structures concerned in its function.\"\r\n\r\nThese effects or changes give rise to the five cardinal symptoms of\r\ninflammation: pain, heat, redness, swelling and impaired function\r\n(dolor, calor, rubor, tumor, functio læsa).\r\n\r\nProctitis may exist many years before the pain and heat become\r\nnoticeable or are complained of by the victim of this insidious\r\ndisease, the bodily symptoms of which are well expressed before the\r\nlocal trouble demands attention and treatment. The sufferer from\r\nproctitis is unable to detect the change from a normal color of the\r\nmucous membrane (a light, muddy gray) to an extremely abnormal one (a\r\nfiery redness). The swelling or puffiness of the mucous membrane\r\nbecomes more marked as repeated attacks of subacute and acute\r\ninflammation occur, from year to year, over a period of twenty or more\r\nyears. During all this time impairment of the function and structure of\r\nthe anal and rectal canals is incessantly going on. The nervous and\r\nmuscular spasmodic contraction of the diseased anus and rectum, which\r\nin time become more or less permanently constricted, steadily increases\r\nthe stagnation and engorgement of blood in the dilated arteries, veins,\r\narterioles, venous rootlets and capillaries. All of the circulatory\r\nvessels, especially the smaller ones, become enlarged, varicose; and an\r\naggregation of varicosed vessels forms a tumor called a pile or\r\nhemorrhoid. Inflammation interferes with nutrition of the anal and\r\nrectal tissues, rendering them friable or weak and easily broken;\r\nwhence the bleeding and painful fissure or the anal ulcer, which so\r\noften are the outcome of proctitis and an accompaniment of piles.\r\n\r\nAs already stated, piles are one of the symptoms of proctitis, and all\r\ncases of piles involve more or less irritability and contraction of the\r\nanal canal and the terminal portion of the rectum through which the\r\nfecal matter is forced. All the muscular ability of the rectum,\r\nassisted by straining effort of the abdominal muscles, is concentrated\r\nupon the feces to force it through the constricted portion of the lower\r\nbowel. The force exerted not only develops pile tumors, but carries out\r\nwith the feces those tumors that had reached considerable proportions;\r\nthus the frail diseased mucous membrane is torn, and another symptom\r\nadded to a chronic disease. Observation for over twenty years has\r\nconvinced me that chronic proctitis usually exists fifteen, twenty or\r\nmore years before piles are developed (if developed at all), from daily\r\npressure on the inflamed, congested, dilated, varicose, friable\r\nblood-vessels and surrounding tissue.\r\n\r\nPiles are easily and quickly cured without any annoyance to the\r\nsufferer. Chronic proctitis may be cured, but not quickly, as time is\r\nrequired to undo damage to tissues so long invaded by inflammatory\r\nprocess. Any one that allows a continuance of \"a touch of the piles,\"\r\nas the expression is, and omits to take proper treatment as soon as\r\nthis \"touch\" is felt, simply invites or takes chances of some form of\r\ncancer of the lower bowel later in life.\r\n\r\nAll other forms of disease of the lower bowel will yield to treatment\r\nsatisfactory to physician and patient, but I am sorry to say cancer\r\ncases are numerous, and up to the present time we have no cure for this\r\ndreadful disease. If you value health, if you desire to avoid future\r\nsuffering and disease, be sure that the lower bowel is free from\r\ninflammation, for with such freedom you will escape the many symptoms\r\nof proctitis described in my treatise on diseases of the anus and\r\nrectum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nPRURITUS OR ITCHING OF THE ANUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the many symptoms of proctitis is the existence of anal channels\r\nfrom which an inflammatory product exudes through the skin, causing\r\npainful itching of the skin around the anal margin and not infrequently\r\naround the buttocks to the distance of three, six or even more inches\r\nfrom the anal orifice. An aggravated form of pruritus ani is much more\r\ntrying to physical endurance than severe pain. Sometimes the torture is\r\nso great that a portion of the body will be covered with cold\r\nperspiration.\r\n\r\nThe natural color of the integument about the anus slowly changes to a\r\ndull whitish appearance. As the pathological process goes on, the skin\r\nbecomes thickened and parchment-like. In exceptional cases the mucous\r\nmembrane of the anal canal becomes toughened and hardened like\r\ncardboard. As a consequence there is a degree of inertia in the\r\nmuscular action of the parts affected.\r\n\r\nThe inflamed, thickened and indurated integument near the anus takes on\r\nthe form of folds, wrinkles or rugæ, of more or less prominence; but as\r\nthese extend out over the buttocks they become more and more\r\nobliterated, leaving no clue to the direction of the channel which\r\nleads from the site of inflammation; which latter, however, may be\r\nlearned from the itching, or from the burning sensation with some\r\nsoreness, over portions of their length.\r\n\r\nDuring a practice extending over twenty years, I have found only two\r\ncases in which one of these channels was the seat of a slight abscess.\r\nIt is not usual that pus formations occur in these inflammatory\r\nchannels. At the margin of the opening from the rectum to the anal tube\r\nare five or six small crescent-shaped loops, semi-lunar valves,\r\nseparated by vertical ridges (the anal columns). Naturally in chronic\r\nproctitis the zone of tissue just above the sphincter muscles and\r\nslightly within their grasp at the upper portion of the anal tube,\r\nwould suffer greatly from the morbid process, owing to the abnormal\r\nconstriction of the tissues and to the incidental pressure and injury,\r\nfrom time to time, as the stool passes the diseased region. Just under\r\nthe mucous membrane covering the anal columns and semilunar valves is\r\nthe fatty tissue forming a bed upon which the mucous membrane rests. It\r\nis sufficiently lax to permit considerable movement of the mucous\r\nmembrane on the muscular coat beneath it. The frail, fatty, loose\r\nconnective tissue in the grasp of the sphincter muscles would be the\r\nfirst to become impaired by inflammatory process, the product of which\r\nfinds its way down and out under the mucous membrane of the anal canal\r\nand integument of the buttocks for quite a distance, occasioning\r\nitching, pain, soreness or burning in the integument covering the\r\ncourse of the channel.\r\n\r\nHere we have the pathological reason why local remedies to the outer\r\nsurface of the skin will not cure pruritus ani. Also the reason why\r\ndieting is useless, and why internal remedies are worthless for the\r\ncure of anal itching; for the itching, as shown, is the result of an\r\ninflammatory product in the channels under the skin of the victim,\r\nnumbering from five to twenty. Over fifteen years ago I discovered the\r\ncause of the great suffering from painful itching at the anus and\r\ncontiguous tissues and have been able to give instant relief, and in a\r\nlittle time permanent cure, in every case treated since then. It is\r\nwell for those who have an occasional attack of pruritus ani to take\r\ntreatment at once for proctitis proper, as well as for this symptom,\r\nitching resulting from these channels. The proctitis, if neglected,\r\nwill only be the means of increasing the size, length and number of\r\nthese channels. In chronic, sub-acute and acute stages of proctitis\r\nthere is more or less secretion of inflammatory product; and often the\r\nsufferer is able to discover, in dejections from the bowels, a yellow\r\nsyrup-like fluid, of the consistency of glycerine or white of egg, at\r\ntimes streaked with blood and purulent matter indicating ulceration.\r\n\r\nShould the proctitis be cured and these channels remain, there may be\r\nsufficient inflammatory product in the channels to ooze through the\r\nskin to the outer surface, and excite itching; or if a portion of the\r\nchannel escapes treatment, the same symptom may be expected at any\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe size and length of these channels are best determined by making a\r\nsmall opening into them through the integument, then inserting a silver\r\nprobe in both directions, determining the distance under the mucous\r\nmembrane of the anal tube and the distance under the skin of the\r\nbuttocks.\r\n\r\nIn some cases a few of these channels open into the rectum just above\r\nthe internal sphincter muscles and become filled with water during the\r\nuse of the enema taken to move and cleanse the bowels. As a rule, one\r\nend of the channel is under the mucous membrane of the terminal portion\r\nof the rectum, and the other somewhere under the skin of the anus or of\r\nthe buttocks.\r\n\r\nI presume that no disease of the human body has been assigned more\r\nreasons for its existence, with the exception of constipation, than\r\nthat mere symptom of a disease, anal pruritus; a symptom which\r\n\"Regulars\" call a \"disease,\" but \"Irregulars\" know to be only a\r\nsymptom. It is very amusing to observe how they fill pages in their\r\ntext-books, guessing, wondering and paying their respects to the\r\nimaginary quack doctors, \"who are reaping a harvest of ill-gotten\r\ngain.\" The usual medical writer is a compound of ignorance, egoism and\r\ngarrulity, and this may account for the great crop of reasons for\r\n\"diseases.\" However, the writers in question are not so much to blame\r\nafter all, even though they do belong to county medical societies; for\r\nhow can they well resist the literary itch with which most of them are\r\nafflicted? Let them keep on writing while victims of pruritus ani wear\r\nout their weary lives scratching through weary nights--nights that\r\nextend into years, until permanent invalidism seems to be their destiny\r\nand end. Who, verily, are the medical quacks? I will leave it to a jury\r\ncomposed of those who have been cured of pruritus ani.\r\n\r\nI have yet to meet the first case of pruritus ani that is without the\r\npresence of the channels above described. There may be cases of itching\r\nat the anus and these channels entirely absent, but I have yet to\r\ndiscover such a case and I very much doubt if it exists. I am happy to\r\ninform the reader that all cases of pruritus ani are cured with ease\r\nand without any restrictions as to diet, and without internal remedies\r\nfor the blood, nervous system, etc., given by doctors that guess. The\r\ncauses are easily discovered; the symptoms are easily found and\r\nremoved; the victim of pruritus ani may therefore escape from the\r\nlabyrinth of error of the medical authors and practitioners who ought\r\nto be educators instead of \"obstacators\"--obstacles and\r\nstumbling-blocks in medical progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nABSCESS AND FISTULA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our daily affairs we take thought for the future and reason from\r\ncause to effect. We observe, anticipate, expect and suspect. This is a\r\ncommendable practice, for it is the one that is most likely to lead to\r\nsuccess. Can we not acquire a similar attitude and habit in regard to\r\nour health? Habit is sub-conscious attention. Can we not give\r\nsub-conscious attention to the little details of such bodily functions\r\nas are liable to get out of order? Can we not by a settled habit, that\r\nis, by the formation of a second nature, assure our vital success, on\r\nwhich the continuance of the enjoyment of life so much depends? If some\r\npart of a complicated machine gets out of order it must be repaired at\r\nonce or damage may result to other parts of it. Again, if our business\r\naccounts will not balance, the error must be found and corrected at\r\nonce, or the evidence of it will annoy us sooner or later. Why should\r\nnot such prompt care and attention be given to the human mechanism, to\r\nthe economy of vital functions? It is not often that we neglect disease\r\nof the hands, head, face or neck because the exposure of such disease\r\nto public gaze might embarrass us; but alas for the portion of the body\r\nout of sight, especially for the internal organs, when they fail to\r\nperform their functions normally. Most of us allow the mechanism of the\r\nhuman body to shift as best it can and as long as it can, should it\r\nhappen to become ungeared, ignoring the frequent warnings which the\r\never increasing morbid changes and wreckage give us. And then we\r\nsurrender and succumb. What else can we do? Our vital creditors file\r\ntheir claims in the high court of Vital Bankruptcy. What poor business\r\npolicy, and what a wretched tenant! For fifteen or more years we may\r\nhave had warning \"touches of the piles,\" sometimes accompanied with\r\nindigestion, constipation, diarrhea and insidious auto-infection and\r\noccasionally with local symptoms in and around the anal canal and its\r\nexternal orifice; these to an intelligent tenant should have been\r\nevidence of proctitis, or worse, of periproctitis--inflammation of the\r\nconnective tissue of the rectal tube. What have we done? We have\r\ndisregarded the warnings of our ungeared, disordered machine, or else\r\nwe have merely tinkered with it. The human factory receives less\r\nattention than does the commercial. Soon, all too soon, the silver cord\r\nis loosed and the golden bowl broken, and just before that event,\r\nfrightened, but too late, we do a little more tinkering under a\r\ndoctor's direction, and spill the contents--of the golden bowl with\r\nwhich we were so careless--spill it into another world, to begin our\r\nfolly over again!\r\n\r\nDo you know that this occasional \"touch of the piles\" over a period of\r\nmany years, and all that it involves, is a precursor and an invitation\r\nto the development of that deadly enemy, Cancer--a worse disaster than\r\nfinancial ruin? It is my duty to utter a warning here. Only one making\r\na specialty of the diseases of the alimentary canal is aware of the\r\nfrequency of the occurrence of cancer in the lower bowel resulting from\r\nchronic inflammatory process, induration, etc. I have been, again and\r\nagain, shocked and alarmed at the reckless neglect that has brought on\r\nthis as yet incurable disease--cancer.\r\n\r\nThese remarks apply well to what I have to say on Abscess and Fistula\r\nat the terminal portion of the intestinal canal. It is the old, old\r\nstory of being \"touched by the piles for many years,\" and neglect,\r\nending in dread and despair at the necessity of being bored full of\r\nholes by pus seeking an outlet. The victim wonders at the spread of the\r\nlocal trouble, and that an opening for the pus canals has frequently to\r\nbe made three to sixteen inches away from the seat of the abscess. In a\r\nformer chapter the subject of proctitis and piles was gone into, and\r\nsome idea given of the invasion of inflammation in the rectal and anal\r\ntissues.\r\n\r\nIn exceptional cases the exciting cause of anal and rectal abscess and\r\nfistula, or of abscess and fistula of the buttocks, may be a traumatic\r\ninjury or accident, produced, say, by a blow or a fall bruising the\r\ntissues, or by sharp, hard substances--such as pieces of bone or\r\nnutshell--from within the canal, lacerating it. But wounds of this\r\ncharacter are very infrequent compared with chronic inflammation\r\n(proctitis) as the exciting cause. There are several varieties of\r\nproctitis recognized as the exciting cause of abscess and fistula,\r\nnamely, traumatic, dysenteric, diphtheritic, gonorrheal, catarrhal,\r\netc. The reader should not only pardon me, but should be grateful if by\r\nadding another name to the list I point out the most common cause,\r\nnamely, _diaper-itic proctitis_. As pointed out in the first chapter or\r\ntwo, the improper use of the diaper will evidence its deplorable result\r\nwhen the period of manhood or womanhood is reached, by some of the many\r\nsymptoms of proctitis.\r\n\r\nProctitis may be considered as acute, subacute or chronic according to\r\nthe duration of the process; or as atrophic or hypertrophic from the\r\nstructural changes induced. But no matter about the cause and character\r\nof the proctitis, the question is, Have you inflamed anal and rectal\r\ncanals? If you have, then the very annoying symptom, abscess or\r\nfistula, is liable to occur any day. Can you afford to take the\r\nchances?\r\n\r\nJust under the mucous membrane of the anus and rectum there is a layer\r\nof loose, fatty, connective tissue, called areolar tissue. When it is\r\ninvaded by inflammation, abscess and fistula may occur. On the outside\r\nof the rectal wall, at the terminal portion, there is also much loose,\r\nfatty (areolar) tissue filling the ischio-rectal fossa, which is very\r\nprone to suppuration, and inflammation here is called periproctitis.\r\nThis is the most common and serious seat and source of the septic\r\nprocess, which process is usually the proximate cause of death after\r\ncapital surgical operations upon the rectum. Beside the abundance of\r\nfatty tissue--whose function is to serve as a cushion to the rectum at\r\nits terminal portion and at the back and sides of the wall--there is a\r\ntriangular space in front of the rectum containing fatty areolar\r\ntissue, which space is often the location of a pus cavity. Pus, like\r\nall fluids, follows the path of least resistance. The progress of\r\nimprisoned pus may take weeks, months and years before an abnormal\r\ncommunication between the abscess and the external portion of the body\r\nis completed. The imprisoned contents of the abscess cavity and the pus\r\ncanal or fistula often give rise to much annoyance before finding an\r\noutlet. There will be pain in the muscles of the buttocks, called\r\nmyalgia; and pain at the end of the spine, called coccygodynia. For\r\nthis latter pain do not, I pray you, as is so often done, have your\r\nspine removed by the too ready surgeon. No need of it at all. You might\r\njust as sensibly have the muscles cut out for myalgia. Pus in fistulous\r\nchannels may burrow for several years through the muscular and\r\nconnective tissue structures before finally forming an external opening\r\nthrough the integument; although its nearness to the surface is\r\nfrequently marked by a localized puffiness and inflammation, which,\r\nhowever, may disappear for a time without forming an external opening.\r\nThis condition of affairs results in periodical attacks of\r\ncoccygodynia, myalgia and neuralgia of the buttocks and lower\r\nextremities.\r\n\r\nThe important question with the victim of abscess and fistula is, \"How\r\ndid I get it? I don't care for the various and numerous names you give\r\nto these fistulas: what I should like to know is, How does it come\r\nabout that I, an apparently healthy person, have such a nasty disease?\"\r\nSimply years of neglect, is my answer. Neglect is due sometimes, and\r\nperhaps generally, to ignorance of the thing neglected. The laity can\r\nin large measure blame the medical profession for it, and especially\r\nthose surgeons who have long made a specialty of the treatment of anal\r\nand rectal diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGIN AND USE OF THE ENEMA.\r\n\r\n\r\nPliny recorded the fact that \"the use of clysters or enemata was first\r\ntaught by the stork, which may be observed to inject water into its\r\nbowels by means of its long beak.\" The _British Medical Journal_,\r\nreviewing the newly published _Storia della Farmacia_, says that\r\nFrederigo Kernot describes in it the invention of the enema apparatus,\r\nwhich he looks upon as an epoch in pharmacy as important as the\r\ndiscovery of America in the history of human civilization. The glory of\r\nthe invention of this instrument, so beneficial to suffering mankind,\r\nbelongs to an Italian, Gatenaria, whose name ought to find a modest\r\nplace together with Columbus, Galileo, Gioja and other eminent and\r\nillustrious Italians. He was a compatriot of Columbus and professor at\r\nPavia, where he died in 1496, after having spent several years in\r\nperfecting his instrument. The enema apparatus may be justly named the\r\nqueen of the world, as it has reigned without a rival for three hundred\r\nyears over the whole continent, besides Brazil and America. The enema\r\ncame into use soon after the invention of the apparatus itself.\r\nBouvard, physician to Louis XIII, applied two hundred and twenty\r\nenemata to this monarch in the course of six months. In the first years\r\nof Louis XIV it became the fashion of the day. Ladies took three or\r\nfour a day to keep a fresh complexion, and the dandies used as many for\r\na white skin. Enemata were perfumed with orange, angelica, bergamot and\r\nroses, and Mr. Kernot exclaims enthusiastically, \"_O se tornasse questa\r\nmoda!_\" (Oh, that this fashion would return!). The medical profession\r\nat first hailed the invention with delight, but soon found the\r\napplication _infra dig._, and handed it over to the pharmacist; but\r\nshameful invectives, sarcasms and epigrams, hurled at those who\r\nexercised the humble duty of applying the apparatus, made them at last\r\nresign it to barbers and hospital attendants. (_Year Book of\r\nTherapeutics_, Wood, 1872.)\r\n\r\n    \"The history of the warm bath,\" says Dr. Paris, \"presents another\r\n    curious instance of the vicissitudes to which the reputation of our\r\n    valuable resources is so universally exposed. That which for so\r\n    many ages was esteemed the greatest luxury in health, and the most\r\n    efficacious remedy in disease, fell into total disrepute in the\r\n    reign of Augustus, for no other reason than because Antonius Musa\r\n    had cured the Emperor of a dangerous malady by the use of the cold\r\n    bath. The most frigid water that could be procured was in\r\n    consequence recommended on every occasion.... This practice,\r\n    however, was doomed but to an ephemeral popularity, for, although\r\n    it restored the Emperor to health, it shortly afterward killed his\r\n    nephew and son-in-law Marcellus, an event which at once deprived\r\n    the remedy of its credit and the physician of his popularity.\r\n\r\n    \"That the _warm_ and not the _cold_ bath was esteemed by the\r\n    ancient Greeks for its invigorating properties may be inferred from\r\n    a dialogue of Aristophanes, in which one of the characters says, 'I\r\n    think none of the sons of the gods ever exceeded Hercules in bodily\r\n    and mental force.' Upon which the other asks, 'Where didst thou\r\n    ever see a cold bath dedicated to Hercules?'\r\n\r\n    \"Thus there exists a fashion in medicine, as in the other affairs\r\n    of life, regulated by the caprice and supported by the authority of\r\n    a few leading practitioners, which has been frequently the occasion\r\n    of dismissing from practice valuable medicines and of substituting\r\n    others less certain in their effects and more questionable in their\r\n    nature. As years and fashion revolve, so have these neglected\r\n    remedies, each in its turn, risen again into favor and notice,\r\n    whilst old receipts, like old almanacs, are abandoned until the\r\n    period may arrive that will once more adjust them to the spirit and\r\n    fashion of the times.\" (J. A. Paris, _Pharmacologia_, p. 31, New\r\n    York, 1825.)\r\n\r\n    \"A story told of Voltaire,\" says Dr. Arthur Leared, \"well\r\n    illustrates both the evil effects of constipation and the advantage\r\n    of using the enema. The great philosopher was one day so miserable\r\n    and dejected that he told a friend he had resolved to hang himself.\r\n    His friend called the next morning to ascertain whether the resolve\r\n    had been or was intended to be carried out. But Voltaire only\r\n    replied, with a smile, 'I have been well washed out this morning.'\"\r\n    (Op. cit., p. 200.)\r\n\r\nFor those suffering from chronic intestinal uncleanliness or\r\nconstipation, an occasional intestinal wash-out, or bath, is quite as\r\nsatisfactory as an \"occasional\" external bath or the \"occasional\" use\r\nof a cathartic medicine. If there is a necessity for cleansing and\r\npurifying the bowels at all, why not do it properly and systematically\r\nuntil the condition that made the artificial cleansing necessary is\r\nremoved? Who would tolerate the cleaning of dining-room, kitchen, dairy\r\nand other utensils in domestic use only when they became so foul that\r\nthey could not be endured any longer without great annoyance? Away with\r\nthe \"occasional\" cleansing habit for either external or internal bodily\r\ncleanliness! There are persistent causes for internal uncleanliness,\r\nfor the tardy action of the bowels, which require regular periods for\r\ncleansing until cure is effected.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that food taken into the stomach will reach the colon\r\nin five hours. For nineteen hours the sewage waste of the body is\r\ngradually becoming a fetid pool before an outlet is furnished it by the\r\none-movement-a-day people; and O ye gods of health! how many of us\r\nthere are that haven't even one movement a day! For a few hours the\r\nabsorbent cells of the colon will try to extract as much of the\r\nnutritious residue as the system calls for, but along with it a lot of\r\npoisonous filth will be absorbed. The call of the system for\r\nnourishment should be fully answered by the small intestines. Savages\r\nhave four or five movements a day, and we certainly should not have\r\nless than three. People of refined sentiments will, at such a\r\ndisclosure, bestir themselves to better things.\r\n\r\nWater, when properly applied, is the only remedy that meets the\r\nphysiological and pathological requirements of the chronically\r\nconstipated. By its use the diseased, spasmodically contracted muscular\r\ntube is simply dilated, and the imprisoned feces and gases above are\r\npermitted to pass down and through the temporarily occluded section of\r\nthe diseased bowels, the patient will have the consciousness of neatly\r\naccomplishing an imperative requirement, and the satisfaction which\r\ncleanliness entails.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nHOW OFTEN SHOULD AN ENEMA BE TAKEN?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following lines will show you how advertising is done in medical\r\njournals. \"Dear Doctor: The spring being the time for cathartics, I beg\r\nto call your attention to R. L. (yellow label),...\"\r\n\r\nWhy is spring a special time for cathartics? Has the intestinal canal\r\nbeen obstructed like the Erie Canal during the winter months? With as\r\nmuch propriety they might advertise: \"Dear Doctor: The spring being the\r\ntime for bathing, I beg to call your attention to antiseptic bath\r\nsoap,...\"\r\n\r\nI suppose that a sort of annual cleansing of the alimentary canal is\r\nsuggested so that the summer heat may be less objectionable, as it\r\nwarms up foul bodies. However, attention once a year is better than\r\nnone at all, as said of the Augean stables.\r\n\r\nNot long ago I had a conversation with the proprietor of a bath cabinet\r\ncompany, who had given some thought to hygienic measures, and he\r\nconsidered it essential to flush the bowels with water once a month to\r\nsecure \"proper cleanliness.\" This opinion is quite in advance of the\r\nannual cathartic cleansing. Some people may have acquired the habit of\r\na monthly cathartic \"cleansing\"; others wash out once a week, and a few\r\nonce a day: all of them act from their idea of cleanliness, as they\r\nwould perform the ablution of their hands, face and body. There are\r\nsome hygienic students who have adopted the idea of \"cleansing\" the\r\nbowels with warm water once or twice a week, which practice is quite in\r\nadvance of the annual or monthly attention. All have reasons for the\r\nmanner and time they adopt to \"cleanse\" the bowels; and yet they find\r\nthat they are not cleansed properly, as they still have spells of\r\nbiliousness and misery. They wonder at themselves for being so rash and\r\nbold as to take an enema twice a week, and begin to feel that they have\r\nreached a point of positive danger.\r\n\r\nOne anxiety is that they will weaken the bowels by the use of a pint or\r\na quart of water once a month, or once or twice a week. Another is that\r\nthey will wash away the mucus, leaving the membrane of the bowels as\r\ndry as an oven. Another is that they will form the dreadful habit of\r\nusing the enemata. What a pity to form such a cleanly habit! Sorry for\r\nthem!\r\n\r\nAnother stubborn objection is, that flushing of the bowels is not\r\nnatural. These foolish objections and fears can be attributed to\r\nmedical authors who belong to medical societies. It is very strange how\r\nthese authors adopt so many wrong notions about the physiology and\r\npathology of the bowels. What an erroneous and absurd idea that the\r\nenema should weaken the bowels! Why should it? Exercise ought to\r\nstrengthen muscular tissue; and what could give the bowels more gentle\r\nmuscular exercise than the proper use of them? Has the reader any idea\r\nof the amount of water requisite for the distention of an elastic\r\nmuscular tube, about five feet in length and two and a half inches in\r\ndiameter in the widest part? The large intestine is capable of great\r\ndistention, as is frequently demonstrated in fecal impaction described\r\nin previous chapters. The quantity is named in gallons. The amount of\r\nwater usually injected at one time--from one pint to two quarts--can\r\nhardly be said to distend the bowels at all. I wish the enemata did\r\nhave power to weaken that part of the bowel involved in disease. I am\r\nvery sorry it does not weaken it. For twenty years it has been\r\ndemonstrated to my mind that almost every case of chronic constipation,\r\nbiliousness, intestinal foulness, diarrhea, indigestion, self-poisoning\r\n(auto-infection or auto-intoxication) was due to too much activity and\r\nvigor of the lower bowels, this excessive activity and vigor being the\r\nresult of chronic proctitis, colitis, etc. To lessen this muscular\r\nirritability, and to devise means to relieve and cure quickly, has cost\r\nme more studious hours than the aggregate of all the other diseases and\r\nsymptoms of the lower bowels.\r\n\r\nIf liquids washed away the mucus from the mucous membrane, the throats\r\nof many individuals ought to be very harsh and dry, inasmuch as six to\r\neight glasses of liquids pass through their mouths and throats during\r\nevery day of twenty-four hours. Even after the \"dry feeling in the\r\nthroat and stomach\" has been bountifully attended to by the owner, the\r\nconversation usually becomes more loquacious and hilarious, and there\r\nis no suggestion that the intemperate person had spent many hours in a\r\nhot desert without water. The frequent flushings they give their\r\nthroats and stomachs really do not seem to wash the mucus away.\r\n\r\nWhen a person consults an oculist about an affection of the eyes and\r\nglasses are prescribed, good sense will inform him that the glasses\r\nmust be worn while the imperfect functioning of the eyes requires them.\r\nIf a limb be fractured and splints be applied, would you worry lest you\r\nform the habit of wearing them? Certainly not; you expect in due time\r\nto recover the proper use of the limb. So if you are compelled to use\r\ncrutches you do not worry about forming the crutch habit, for you will\r\nuse them as long as needed and discard them at the proper time.\r\n\r\nAs to its being unnatural to flush the bowels with water, I would say\r\nthat it is very unnatural to suffer from proctitis accompanied with its\r\nannoying symptoms, such as constipation, indigestion, diarrhea,\r\nauto-intoxication, emaciation, anemia, muddy complexion, foul breath,\r\nblotches and pimples on the face, each and all of which indicate a\r\nphysical debasement.\r\n\r\nIt is unnatural to wear glasses, crutches, splints, wigs, artificial\r\nteeth, artificial eyes, but many people do such unnatural things. Many\r\nof our habits are not exactly \"natural,\" but they are rational, none\r\nthe less; such, for example, as bathing the body night and morning;\r\ncleansing the mouth and teeth after each meal; and the nostrils and\r\nears several times a day. The frequency of these practices may, with\r\nsome people, be unnecessary and useless, but no real harm is done by\r\ntheir scrupulous cleanliness--physical and mental.\r\n\r\nProctitis is usually worse than it seems to be. This is because of the\r\ninsidious progress of the inflammation during the fifteen, twenty or\r\nmore years before the local symptoms at the anus or in the anal canal\r\nare sufficiently annoying to compel the sufferer to seek treatment.\r\nSuch sufferers are, as a rule, born with the idea that the liver\r\nregulates the whole alimentary canal; and if the sufferer has not this\r\nhereditary notion, his physician will soon impart it to him with his\r\ndiagnosis and treatment. The disciple of cathartics, whether the\r\ncathartics be in the form of pills, powders, or solutions, or contain\r\nbelladonna and opium to overcome the cramping pain the dose would\r\notherwise occasion, has no legitimate reason to indulge in the hope of\r\na cure or of even moderate relief of the real source of trouble--the\r\nproctitis. It is proceeding on the liver theory, when the key is, as\r\nhas been shown in these articles, _Proctitis_, inflammation of the\r\nanus and rectum. Physicians ignorant of the key to all bowel troubles\r\neven prescribe strychnine in order to stimulate bowels which have\r\nalready an excessive amount of stimulation due to the presence of the\r\nproctitis, which, as has been said, over-stimulates the lower bowels\r\nbecause of the inflammation.\r\n\r\nThe chronic character of proctitis of many years' duration, improperly\r\ndiagnosed and treated, must necessarily compel a rather long and\r\ncontinued use of the enema, especially so if not accompanied by proper\r\nlocal treatment of all the inflamed surface. I should not care to treat\r\npatients suffering from proctitis, constipation, etc., unless they used\r\nthe enema twice a day. The feces and gases should escape the bowels at\r\nleast twice in twenty-four hours. Any less than two stools a days is\r\nabnormal and will result in infection and disease. You may not always\r\nsucceed in having two stools when first treating the local disease, but\r\nwhat you properly start out to accomplish will be attained in due time.\r\n\r\nFree evacuation of the contents of the bowels should occur at least\r\ntwice in twenty-four hours. This can be accomplished by injecting into\r\nthe colon from one to four quarts of warm water. Before taking the\r\nlarge injection, relieve the bowels of any gas seeking liberation, and\r\nof course, also, of whatever feces may come readily. Then take a small\r\ninjection, using very little water: just enough to bring on a relief of\r\nas much feces and gas as possible. It is not well to drive the gas back\r\nand up into the colon; hence the precaution to suggest a further\r\npassage with a small quantity of water before taking the large\r\ninjection.\r\n\r\nEnemata, and also the use of the recurrent douche, can in no way be\r\nharmful--if the water be of a proper temperature--to a normal or even\r\nto a diseased bowel; therefore the fear of habit is absurd and should\r\nnot receive a moment's consideration. The length of time during which\r\nthe enemata and the douche are to be used, whether months or years,\r\nwill depend on the character of the disease that made its use\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nMAN'S BEST FRIEND.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Travel the world from end to end\r\n    You ne'er will find a better friend\r\n    Than sparkling water, pure and free,\r\n    Most precious boon to you and me.\r\n    It cheers the faint, it crowns the feast,\r\n    Makes food to grow for man and beast;\r\n    In sickness soothes the fevered frame,\r\n    There's healing in its very name.\r\n    And what can more life-giving be\r\n    Than cooling breezes from the sea,\r\n    Whose bosom bears upon their way\r\n    The stately ships from day to day?\r\n    A treasure trove of priceless worth;\r\n    A jewelled belt for mother Earth,\r\n    Encircling with its silvery bands,\r\n    She binds together many lands.\r\n    To cure disease dame Nature brings\r\n    Her remedy in mineral springs;\r\n    Water without, water within,\r\n    Equally good for stout or thin;\r\n    And more than man can e'er devise\r\n    Invigorates and purifies.\r\n    Travel the world from end to end,\r\n    You ne'er will find a better friend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nPHYSIOLOGICAL IRRIGATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe scientific irrigation of land is pretty well understood by those\r\nwho have financial interest in soil requiring it. The wonderful beauty\r\nand freshness of flower and fruit give evidence of what scientific\r\nirrigation can do. So from a commercial and esthetic point of view the\r\nproper amount of daily moisture for land, tree or vine, is of such\r\nimportance that it receives the consideration of those interested. How\r\nmany persons, however, in the course of a lifetime have given ten\r\nminutes to serious consideration of the question: _How much water\r\nshould be imbibed daily under the varying conditions of the body's\r\ngarden?_ Those who give no consideration to the problem of how to\r\nattain and maintain a healthy and vigorous physical basis are persons\r\nwho usually drift into habits for which they will, sooner or later,\r\nhave to pay the penalty.\r\n\r\nFor the first twenty or more years the body is, as a rule, unfortunate\r\nin not having an intelligent tenant. For man misuses his physiological\r\nestate, and lets things go to rack and ruin ere he wakes to realize how\r\nit might have been as to length of days and strength of body and mind.\r\nEnlighten him, after he has reached adult years, on the values and\r\nneeds of physiological and psychological functions; you will find that\r\nhowever eager he may be to follow the light he is handicapped by\r\nvicious habits and by confirmed, destructive changes which had seized\r\non him when he was quite too young and incompetent to care for his\r\nbody. What a topsy-turvy world this is, to be sure!\r\n\r\nIt is astonishing what a number of people there are who drink little or\r\nnothing, and especially amazing is it to find this lack of sense in\r\npeople suffering from constipation. One would suppose that they above\r\nall others would see the wisdom of irrigating their bowels. But it is\r\nseldom that there is one who thinks of such a thing. A cup of coffee or\r\ntea at meal-time, in addition to the liquid contained in the food, is\r\nthe extent of water consumption by ever so many teetotalers and other\r\n\"totalers,\" especially women, until they reach, say, thirty years of\r\nage. Such persons as a rule are not long-lived, inasmuch as their power\r\nof resistance is small, owing to their lack of blood, a lack in quality\r\nas well as in quantity. The blood pressure in their arteries and veins\r\nis light, as evidenced by their pale, sallow complexion, and the dry,\r\nscaly, feverish skin, which seldom or never perspires. The body garden\r\nhas not been properly irrigated and is slowly drying up as age\r\nadvances. Did you ever notice how like death such persons appear when\r\nthey are asleep? Their dull, pasty complexions alarm us then. When I\r\nsee them a desire to soak these dried specimens of humanity possesses\r\nme. Is it not unfortunate that we were not born with an automatic\r\nirrigator? We even lack a tube on our boiler to indicate the danger\r\npoint! Deficient by nature in these little conveniences, and unaided by\r\nscience, man is compelled to give some attention to the irrigation of\r\nhis physiological soil, however indifferent or careless he may be.\r\n\r\nPlanters and gardeners have treatises on irrigation. Have mothers or\r\nnurses any similar guides? Such books are unknown to modern\r\ncivilization. Infants, boys and girls, and adults are brought up\r\nhaphazard, and their garden of life becomes choked with weeds. The\r\ndrought soon makes itself felt, and a little graveyard mound is their\r\nusual fate. Before some of us wither and fade, to what a pest-weed is\r\nour adipose changed for want of life-giving water.\r\n\r\nMan's most serious physiological fault is the toleration of\r\nconstipation; or even of semi-constipation induced by the\r\ntwenty-four-hour habit of stooling. In other words, his fault is the\r\ntoleration of intestinal uncleanliness. And next to this foolhardiness\r\nis his negligence in the matter of drinking daily a quantity of pure\r\nsoft water sufficient to aid in the proper stimulation and circulation\r\nof the blood, in the proper elimination of the waste material from the\r\nbody, and in the proper assimilation of nutriment by the system.\r\n\r\nIf parents would encourage their children to become bibbers of pure\r\nspring water daily it would not be easy to make them bibbers of\r\nintoxicants in after years. I would give a child all the liquid it\r\ndesires, I would even encourage it to take more rather than less, and\r\nthe best liquid of all for this purpose is pure soft water. Man's body\r\nis 70 per cent water. It is therefore a good-sized water cask with a\r\nramification of countless canals or pipes imbedded in soft connective\r\ntissues, nerves and muscles, all of which are supported by a bony\r\nframework; through the centre of this runs the alimentary canal, down\r\nwhich waters may flow and disappear like unto a stream lost in the\r\nsand, to reappear and ooze from skin, lungs, kidneys and intestinal\r\ncanal. Every organ and tissue luxuriates in water; they lave and live\r\nin and by it. With all kinds of food it is introduced into the body.\r\nWater acts as a solvent for the nutritious elements and as a sponsor\r\nfor the elimination of foreign substances and worn-out tissues of the\r\nsystem. It also serves to maintain a proper degree of tension in the\r\ntissues, which tension is essential to the proper circulation of the\r\nlymphatic fluids.\r\n\r\nThe tonic reaction of externally applied water is well known. But the\r\nadvantages of the internal use of water are hardly known at all because\r\nthe reactions of the circulation, temperature, respiration, digestion\r\nand secretions are less noticed.\r\n\r\nTwo or three pints of cold water at a temperature of forty to\r\nforty-five degrees drunk at intervals of half an hour will reduce the\r\npulse from eight to thirty beats. The copious drinking of cold water\r\nwill act as a diuretic, removing stagnated secretions, and will at the\r\nsame time improve the quality of the pulse and the arterial tone. The\r\ndrinking of warm water will increase the pulse from five to fifteen\r\nbeats, and at the same time will relax the vessel walls and also\r\nincrease the cutaneous secretions to a marked degree.\r\n\r\nThe drinking of a large quantity of water not only increases the\r\nsecretions of the kidneys--assisting them in the work of carrying off\r\nsolid constituents, especially urea--it also increases the secretions\r\nof the skin, saliva, bile, etc. Under proper conditions the internal\r\nuse of water acts as a stimulant to the nerves that control the\r\nblood-vessels, a stimulant similar to that produced by its external\r\napplication.\r\n\r\nI advise the drinking of a copious quantity of water daily. There need\r\nbe no fear that this practice will thin the blood too much, as the\r\nready elimination of the water will not permit such a result to ensue.\r\nI would further advise the generous use of water (temperature 60°) at\r\nmeal-times. I pray you do not drink to wash down food: a bad habit of\r\nmost of us. Drink all you desire; and if you are like many who have no\r\ndesire for water, cultivate it, even if it takes years. The imbibed\r\nwater will be in the tissues in about an hour; and the entire quantity\r\nwill escape in about three and one-half hours. The demand on the part\r\nof the system for water is subject to great variation and is somewhat\r\nregulated by the quantity discharged from the organism. Physiologists\r\ndeclare that water is formed in the body by a direct union of oxygen\r\nand hydrogen, but those who have cultivated the drink-little habit need\r\nnot hope to find an excuse for themselves in this fact: chronic\r\nill-health betrays them. Water in organic relations with the body never\r\nexists uncombined with inorganic salts (especially sodium chloride) in\r\nany of the fluids, semi-solids, or solids of the body. It enters into\r\nthe constitution of the tissues, not as pure water, but always in\r\nconnection with inorganic salts. In case of great loss of blood by\r\nhemorrhage, a saline solution of six parts of sodium chloride with one\r\nthousand parts of sterilized water injected into the system will wash\r\nfree the stranded corpuscles and give the heart something to contract\r\nupon.\r\n\r\nWhen water is taken into the stomach, its temperature, its bulk, and\r\nits slight absorption react upon the system; but the major part of it\r\nis thrown into the intestinal canal. When it is of the temperature of\r\nabout 60° it gives no very decided sensation either of heat or cold;\r\nbetween 60° and 45° it creates a cool sensation, and below 45° a\r\ndecidedly cold one. Water at a temperature of about 50° is a generator\r\nof appetite. A sufficient quantity should be taken for that end; say,\r\none or two tumblers an hour or so before each meal, followed by some\r\nexercise. Those who have acquired the waterless habit, and the many\r\nills resulting from it, will hardly relish cool water as an appetizer;\r\nbut if they would become robust they must adopt the water habit--a\r\nhabit that will refresh and rejuvenate nature.\r\n\r\nWater of a temperature between 60° and 100° relaxes the muscles of the\r\nstomach and is apt to produce nausea, especially if the effect of bulk\r\nbe added to that of temperature. Lukewarm water seems to excite an\r\nupward peristalsis of the intestines and thus produces sickness.\r\n\r\nHot water acts as a stimulant and antiseptic, as a sedative and as a\r\nfood. Water at a temperature of 110° to 120°, or more, will nearly\r\nalways relieve a foul stomach and intestines. It should be slowly\r\nsipped, so that the stomach may not be uncomfortably distended. After\r\nimbibing a pint or a pint and a half, wait for fifteen or thirty\r\nminutes to give it time to pass into the bowels, then drink more if\r\nthought advisable. Drink it an hour before meal-time. It will excite\r\ndownward peristalsis, will dilute the foul contents of the stomach, and\r\nwill thus aid the escape of these contents into the intestines, which\r\nlatter require the washing process as well. Sometimes it is a good\r\nthing to omit one, two or three meals while the washing process is\r\nbeing continued. Commence treatment with pure hot water. To make it\r\nappetizing, add a pinch of salt or of bicarbonate of soda; with\r\nchildren add sugar. It will pay you to follow this treatment for the\r\ncleansing of the alimentary canal.\r\n\r\nThe vitality of the body may be sustained for days and weeks on water\r\nalone; there is therefore no hurry about food. If human beings would\r\nonly keep their bowels and stomachs clean they would avoid all the ills\r\nthat flesh is heir to, except, of course, those due to accident.\r\n\r\nMy remarks have been confined to irrigation _per orem_ (that is, by way\r\nof the mouth), and nothing has been said of irrigation _per anum_ (by\r\ninjection), since I have treated the latter subject fully in several\r\nprevious chapters, to which the reader is referred. Be sure to follow\r\nthe counsel there given, and use the enema two or three times a day in\r\nmoderate quantities as indicated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nPROPER TREATMENT FOR DISEASES OF THE ANUS AND RECTUM VERY ESSENTIAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo doubt the readers of the preceding chapters on proctitis and its\r\nnumerous symptoms--noted under separate headings--would like to know\r\nsomething about the home treatment for such an insidious and grave\r\ndisease. Every sufferer wants to be a self-doctor. This commendable\r\ndesire it is usually impossible to put into practice. If physicians so\r\noften fail to cure the ailments I have described, what can be expected\r\nof those who have no knowledge at all of diagnosis and treatment?\r\n\r\nA skilful physician is the choicest gem of civilization, and an\r\nintelligent patient its worthy setting. Surely it is a moral crime, an\r\ninexcusable folly to tolerate a disease with its inevitable train of\r\ndire consequences, up to the point when the discomfort compels one to\r\nseek treatment. There are patients, of course, who have good and\r\nsufficient excuses for their painful predicament; they have, for\r\nexample, tried persistently for relief and cure, but have failed to\r\nfind a physician competent to treat their particular case. How many\r\nunskilled prescribers there are, and how glaring their shortcomings!\r\nSome hold out taking inducements to sufferers; their one object being\r\nto transfer their patients' cash to their own pocket. 'Twere charitable\r\nto consider these ignorant; but alas! many of them are poisoned by the\r\n\"fakir\" germ. Stuff is sold by the conscienceless, claiming to cure\r\n\"piles,\" to \"give instant relief,\" and promising \"a complete cure in a\r\nfew days\"; and as to itching piles, why! \"only a few applications are\r\nnecessary for a cure; six boxes for five dollars\"! etc.\r\n\r\nNo remedy that sufferers apply themselves can be more than a temporary\r\nrelief: it cannot really cure piles, polypus, fistula, tabs, pruritus\r\n(itching)--all of them consequences of proctitis. Of course one should\r\nbe thankful for the little relief to be got temporarily from advertised\r\nand drug-store drugs; nothing more than relief can be expected of them.\r\nThere are indeed times when a palliative treatment will serve to tide\r\nthe sufferer over a few days until he is able to consult a competent\r\nphysician. But how strange it is that so many sufferers regard their\r\nanatomy and physiology so lightly as to think of using remedies, even\r\nfor relief, without first undergoing a thorough examination by a\r\ncompetent physician. In troubles of a rectal character it is\r\nexceedingly foolhardy to allow any one to prescribe without insisting\r\nupon a thorough examination to ascertain whether there be any disease\r\nof a cancerous nature present, or what the trouble actually is, and its\r\nprogress. To expect one remedy or prescription to meet all the\r\nrequirements for the cure of a chronic disease of the anus and rectum\r\nand of the many complications accompanying it is hardly sensible, but\r\nthat is just what a great many do expect. No one remedy in the market,\r\nor any number of them combined can effect a cure, for the simple reason\r\nthat proper local treatment by a physician is of paramount importance.\r\nUnless of a traumatic (externally produced wound) origin, diseases of\r\nthe anal and rectal canals are usually of fifteen, twenty or more\r\nyears' incubation before the annoying symptoms become apparent. This\r\naccounts for the slight attention to the maturing trouble and for the\r\nfact that such attention can afford nothing more than a palliation or\r\npostponement. A real cure requires a combination of means, all working\r\nharmoniously for the proper length of time. Proper treatment and the\r\nproper time are the two prime requisites; and the third and final\r\nrequisite is, of course, a sensible patient.\r\n\r\nBefore home treatment is to be thought of it is accordingly advisable\r\nto have an examination and a prescription for the specific local\r\ntreatment necessary for a trouble like piles, fissure, polypus, tabs,\r\nitching, fistula, varicose veins, abscess, ulcer, granulation,\r\nhypertrophy, or atrophy as the case may be. The local treatment can\r\nbest be aided by a combination of remedies with suitable instruments\r\nfor their use between the periods of local attention by the physician.\r\nThe writer of this has no cure-all to send the sufferers, although it\r\nmight be to his financial advantage to have one; he is, however, always\r\nready to advise and relieve those who cannot visit him immediately. The\r\nrelief afforded often facilitates the cure by permitting a more\r\nextensive local treatment at the first visit.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Use of Instruments for Injecting Water._\r\n\r\nTo do something at home for one's self for relief from soreness and\r\npain due to anal and rectal diseases, a few suitable instruments are\r\nrequired with which specific remedies may be used, especially that\r\nexcellent remedy--water.\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate that the anal and rectal canals cannot be given rest\r\nwhen invaded by disease. Daily elimination of feces is a very important\r\nfactor to health and to treatment. To accomplish this the very best\r\nmeans is water in various quantities as the case demands. It does not\r\nirritate the diseased canals--as cathartics do--but aids in the escape\r\nof imprisoned feces and gases which lodge above the region of the\r\nmorbid process. Evacuation should be accomplished twice a day, by the\r\ninjection at first of three or four quarts of water--thus obtaining a\r\ngood daily flushing of one's sewer--and then, if advisable, gradually\r\nlessening the quantity at subsequent injections to one or two pints at\r\na time. The temperature should be 100° to 105° or more. Some people\r\nhave an idea that water at the temperature named has a remedial effect\r\non an inflamed anus and rectum. It has none whatever; all it does is to\r\nwash away the deposits which might irritate the inflamed surface. Water\r\nat a temperature of 100° to 105° is not an especially good antiseptic;\r\nand its intestinal use should not be continued longer than to bring\r\naway the effete and fetid material which may be lodged in the colon,\r\nsigmoid flexure and rectum. In the majority of cases its use should be\r\nlimited to aiding the feces to escape from their normal receptacle--the\r\nsigmoid flexure--whenever proctitis does not extend beyond the rectum.\r\nBut many persons are deceived by the conduct of proctitis and are thus\r\nlikely to omit the regular irrigation twice a day. They believe\r\nthemselves to be in pretty good condition and do not realize that their\r\nold, implacable enemy may be excited into riot any day; in which case\r\nthe insurrection may last for months and then slowly settle down to\r\nsemi-quiet again, reaching finally the point of its best behavior for a\r\nshort period or until again provoked.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Use of the Recurrent Douche._\r\n\r\nWater at a temperature of 120° to 130° properly applied is a good\r\ntherapeutic agent in the treatment of proctitis. At that temperature it\r\nis an excellent antiseptic and astringent. Its continuous use for half\r\nto one hour applied with a recurrent douche brings about a contraction\r\nof the engorged and dilated blood-vessels; and accompanied by local\r\ntreatment and by other remedies is the best means known for restoring\r\nthe nerves to their normal function of controlling the proper\r\ncirculation of blood in the diseased organ. Treatment with the\r\nrecurrent douche is of course to follow, not to precede, the evacuation\r\nof the bowels; but at any time when there is a tendency toward\r\nadditional evacuation on the admission of the hot water, the new douche\r\nis easily adjustable to the contingency without removal from the anal\r\ncanal; it will facilitate the escape of the feces with the return flow\r\nof the water. The new recurrent douche has therefore the great\r\nadvantage of promoting simultaneously both the thorough evacuation of\r\nthe bowels, and the therapeutic effect of hot water.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sitz-Bath._\r\n\r\nThere are patients who, because of years of neglect of their local\r\nailments, are taken with severe attacks of inflammation of the anus and\r\nrectum, involving considerable prolapse, much swelling around the anus,\r\nand general local soreness and pain; all of which is often accompanied\r\nby a general disrelish of life. For this condition nothing is so good\r\nas a very hot sitz-bath, if properly adjusted to the parts and\r\ncontinued for about an hour at a sitting. The alleviation afforded is\r\nso decided and the local and prolonged application of hot water so\r\nrestorative that it may be left to the sufferer to determine how often\r\nthis bath is to be repeated. It may be taken as often as there is an\r\ninclination to do so. The sitz-bath apparatus should be scientifically\r\nadapted to the parts so that the bather will not sit lower than ten or\r\ntwelve inches, thereby avoiding a straining position. During the bath\r\nthere should be more or less pressure against the anal tissues, which\r\nassists the hot water in expelling the blood from the inflamed parts.\r\nFrom the beginning to the end of the bath the water must be as hot as\r\nthe tissues will tolerate. Only a small portion of the buttocks need be\r\nimmersed in the hot water.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Spring Water the Ideal Beverage._\r\n\r\nThose who suffer from disease of the rectum, with rare exceptions, are\r\nconstipated or semi-constipated, which condition in turn aggravates or\r\ndisturbs the inflamed parts. To overcome this constipated condition all\r\nsorts of laxatives are taken, which will in the end do grave harm not\r\nonly to the whole system, but especially to the inflamed parts,\r\nirritating them still more. There is a valuable therapeutic agent\r\nseldom taken by the constipated; in fact, it is never thought of;\r\nunfortunately the remedy is not easily to be had in its pure state by\r\nmost of us, boxed as we are in cities. Sold under various names as\r\nmineral water, it is too often adulterated. 'Tis a simple remedy, and\r\nyet it has a wider range of healing power than any other; a universal\r\nsolvent, applicable to all diseases and all states of health. I would\r\nwrite it at the head of all remedial agents: pure spring water! We do\r\nnot drink enough water. If we were to imbibe at least two quarts of\r\npure water daily we would be healthier and have better movements of our\r\nbowels. Water may be taken freely during mealtime; not, however, for\r\nthe purpose of washing down half-masticated food. Alcoholic drinks,\r\ncoffee and tea would better be dispensed with, also tobacco. The\r\nnervous system has enough to bear without the use of avoidable\r\nirritants.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Other Hygienic Agencies._\r\n\r\nToo much cannot be urged as to the advisability of a proper amount of\r\nexercise, sleep, rest, food, breathing, cleanliness (internal and\r\nexternal), as well as and above all, pure, high-minded thoughts and\r\nserene temper--the outcome of the habit of viewing life\r\nphilosophically. Care should be taken to protect the feet and body from\r\nsudden climatic changes, thus avoiding catarrhal troubles, especially\r\nof the lower bowels.\r\n\r\nAs to the wise and proper use of nature's pharmacopoeia, nothing need\r\nbe said here. However, I may be within my limits when I advise patients\r\nto use a little sense and not neglect disease of the lower bowel any\r\nmore than they would neglect that of the eye, ear and throat. In the\r\nlatter case they submit at once to an examination. Why not in the\r\nformer? Let them bear in mind that the cure of chronic proctitis is no\r\nholiday job; that it is, on the contrary, a task which requires\r\nconstant attention. To merely relieve the annoying symptoms that\r\naccompany it cannot be called a cure. But on the other hand relief may\r\nbe the commencement of a cure. Of course the true way of looking at the\r\nsubject of this disease is to regard the cure of proctitis as\r\nnecessarily leading to the disappearance in time of all the other\r\ntroubles that were the outcome of that ailment. Through the harmonious\r\nefforts of patient and physician, marvellous results are often\r\nobtainable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nTHE BODY'S BOOK-KEEPING.\r\n\r\n\r\nMan's food is as varied as his work, more varied than the climate, with\r\none food for the luxurious and one for the poor. The majority of us\r\ntake what we can get, making no complaints; even when we have a cook\r\nand a good one the same is true. The ideal diet prepared by the ideal\r\ncook no one has as yet made fashionable, but one thing is within the\r\nreach of all--cleanliness of the sewers of the body. Keep the contents\r\nof the bowels moving down and out steadily and regularly and you may\r\neat almost any food and in almost any preparation and still be healthy.\r\n\r\nJust as a steam-engine, running at a given rate of speed, must be\r\nsupplied with fuel sufficient to maintain that speed, so the human body\r\nmust have the requisite food to maintain the speed of civilized society\r\nand business, and replace the waste of the tissues; otherwise decline\r\nsets in and the reserve store of strength is exhausted. How shall we\r\ndetermine the proper amount and kind of food for the various ages,\r\nsexes, and conditions of life?\r\n\r\nA leading authority says that the character and amount of the daily\r\nexcreta furnish suggestions as to the required food supply. (Kirk's\r\n_Physiology_, p. 208.) These excreta are found to be carbon, nitrogen,\r\nhydrogen, oxygen in great part, with some sulphur, phosphorus,\r\nchlorine, sodium, etc. A summary is given (_ibid._, p. 432) of the\r\nexpenditure for twenty-four hours:\r\n\r\n    1. From the lungs:\r\n         Carbonic acid                about  15,000 grains\r\n         Water                           \"    5,000   \"\r\n\r\n    2. From the skin:\r\n         Water                           \"   11,500   \"\r\n         Solid and gaseous matters       \"      250   \"\r\n\r\n    3. From the kidneys:\r\n         Water                           \"   23,000   \"\r\n         Organic matter                  \"      680   \"\r\n         Saline bodies                   \"      420   \"\r\n\r\n    4. From the intestines:\r\n        Water                            \"    2,000   \"\r\n        Organic and mineral substances   \"      800   \"\r\n\r\n    Total daily expenditure:\r\n        Solid matters                    \"   17,150   \"\r\n        Water                            \"   49,500   \"\r\n\r\n      Altogether about eight and a half pounds.\r\n\r\n    The credit side of the sheet is about as follows:\r\n\r\n    Solids (chemically dry foods)        \"    8,000 grains\r\n    Water, combined or otherwise   35,000 to 40,000   \"\r\n    Oxygen, absorbed by the lungs        \"   13,000   \"\r\n\r\n      Altogether about eight and a half pounds.\r\n\r\nWith the proper balance between the intake and the outgo, the functions\r\nof the body will be carried on normally, but the balance must be a\r\nproper one; that is, not only must the entire waste be repaired but the\r\ncorrect proportions of one kind of food and another must be observed.\r\nIf all the elements needed are not furnished there can be no true\r\ncounterpoise.\r\n\r\nHow do we expend the energy? By the common wear-and-tear incident upon\r\nall voluntary motion, all work and recreation, carrying on the internal\r\nmovements of digestion and respiration, by thinking, by loss of\r\ntemperature, by indulgence of any of our functions, and by any wrong\r\nindulgence especially. Excessive use, voluntary or otherwise, will of\r\ncourse diminish our total capital and cut short our lives. Could we\r\nalways maintain the right balance we need never die.\r\n\r\nThe importance of what has been said must now be clearly apparent. We\r\nought to be wisely interested in choosing the proper foods for our\r\ndaily needs and in having them properly prepared; we ought to know how\r\nmuch carbohydrates we need, how much proteids, and regulate our diet\r\naccordingly. The foods which contain nitrogen are chiefly the\r\nfollowing: flesh of all animals, milk, eggs, leguminous fruits (peas,\r\nbeans, lentils); those which contain carbohydrates chiefly are bread,\r\nstarch, vegetables and especially potatoes, rice, etc.; foods supplying\r\nfat are butter, lard, fat of meat, etc. Salts are furnished in almost\r\nall other substances, but especially in green vegetables and fruits.\r\nLiquid food is obtained by water, too often neglected, and tea, coffee,\r\nbeer, cider, etc.\r\n\r\nAlcohol has no power to form tissue or to repair waste and cannot be\r\nregarded as a true food. Tea and coffee are almost entirely stimulant,\r\nnot nutritious, and should be taken sparingly or not at all.\r\n\r\nThe common mistakes in diet are over-feeding or taking too much of one\r\nkind of food, and of the latter class perhaps an excess of starchy food\r\nis the most mischievous. If taken in excess, especially by the young,\r\nthe starchy foods are not digested and what does not digest must\r\nputrefy: the result is a bowel distended with harmful gases. Many\r\npeople eat too much nitrogenous food, with resulting plethora or gout.\r\nA great deal of vigorous exercise in the open air is required to use up\r\nsuch a diet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nSELECTION AND PREPARATION OF FOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe requirements for normal digestion, assimilation and elimination\r\nare: (1) An intestinal canal clean and sound from mouth to anus; (2)\r\nnutritious food properly prepared; (3) regularity and moderation in\r\neating; (4) free use of pure water, sufficient to forward the\r\nemulsification and assimilation of the food and the elimination of\r\nwaste--whether that waste be of the residual portion of the food or of\r\ndetritus of tissue; (5) a seasonably clad body, free from fatigue or\r\nloss of sleep; (6) a cheerful mind.\r\n\r\nEvery sensible person will grant that a good digestion of vegetable or\r\nanimal food furnishes sufficient steam and stimulus for the physical\r\nman; that a good digestion of intellectual food (ideas) furnishes the\r\ncorresponding requisites for the mental man; and that exalted\r\nsentiments are the pabulum of the spiritual.\r\n\r\nWhy over-stimulate the physical, and reflexively degrade the mental and\r\nspiritual, by indulgence in tea, coffee, beer, wine, liquors, opium,\r\ntobacco, etc.? Over-stimulation will bring on indigestion; and\r\nprostration will follow that. Remember that Nature does not carry long\r\ncredit accounts.\r\n\r\nA suggestion for the selection and preparation of physical foods is\r\nhere given; this book being hardly the place for a corresponding list\r\nof mental and spiritual foods.\r\n\r\n    FOODS EASY OF DIGESTION.\r\n\r\n    ARTICLES OF FOOD     HOW PREPARED        TIME OF DIGESTION\r\n\r\n    Venison steak

disturbance or is due to a\r\nlocal disease in some portion of the digestive apparatus. Therefore\r\ndiet must be adapted to the sensibility of the stomach and bowels,\r\nto gastric and intestinal secretions, mobility, absorption and\r\nelimination, to the abnormal increased feeling of hunger or to the\r\nabsence of the sensation of hunger.\r\n\r\nThe food should be of easy solubility and offer slight resistance to\r\nthe digestive juices. It should not mechanically or chemically irritate\r\nor impede intestinal peristalsis. It should not increase fermentation\r\nor putrefaction and the greater portion of it should be absorbed.\r\n\r\nThe object of diet is not to eat less food than usual but to secure\r\nmore nourishment until the proper quantity is consumed each day. The\r\nrestriction of foods does not mean limitation. Regular hours for meals\r\nshould be religiously observed by sufferers from indigestion. The food\r\nshould be thoroughly masticated. Good judgment should be used by each\r\nindividual in selecting and preparing the foodstuffs; also in the\r\namount taken at each meal, and the proper length of time to continue\r\nthe diet.\r\n\r\nYou may take:\r\n\r\n    _Soup_--in moderate quantity: Doxsee's clam juice, and little neck\r\n    clams; cream of peas, etc.; vermicelli; tapioca; tomato; clear\r\n    soups of chicken, beef, mutton.\r\n\r\n    _Fish_: trout; bass; perch; shad; weakfish; whitefish; smelts; raw\r\n    oysters.\r\n\r\n    _Meat_: roasted or boiled beef; mutton; venison; calf s head;\r\n    tongue; sweetbread; lamb chops; squab; roasted partridge; pigeon;\r\n    calf's-foot jelly; Armour & Co.'s Vigoral; Valentine's or Wyeth's\r\n    beef juice, or Wiel's beef jelly.\r\n\r\n    _Eggs_: raw; soft-boiled; poached; omelette; eggs on toast.\r\n\r\n    _Bread_--all over a day old: brown; graham; gluten; rye; zwieback;\r\n    crackers; cracked wheat; corn meal; hominy; wheaten and graham\r\n    grits; rolled rye and oats; granose; cerealin; macaroni with\r\n    toasted bread-crumbs; farina, boiled with milk; Milkine; Horlick's\r\n    or Mellin's food.\r\n\r\n    _Vegetables_: spinach; green peas; greens; lettuce; watercress;\r\n    sweet corn; asparagus; celery; artichokes; baked tomatoes;\r\n    cauliflower.\r\n\r\n    _Dessert_: baked, roasted or stewed apples; stewed pears or\r\n    peaches; baked bananas; grapes; oranges; and most ripe fruits, if\r\n    fresh.\r\n\r\n    _Beverages_: hot, cool or cold water an hour before meals. Drink\r\n    freely of the same during meal-time, but not to wash down food.\r\n    Drink also: cereal coffee; buttermilk; koumiss; fresh cider;\r\n    bouillon.\r\n\r\n    _Avoid_: coffee; tea; milk; ice-water; cocoa; chocolate; malt\r\n    liquors; spirituous liquors; sweet and effervescent wines; sugar;\r\n    candies; foods containing much starch; rich soups; sauces and\r\n    chowders; all fried foods; hot or fresh bread; griddle-cakes;\r\n    doughnuts; veal; pork; liver; kidney; hashes; stews; pickled,\r\n    canned, preserved and potted meats; turkey; goose; duck; sausage;\r\n    salmon; salt mackerel; cabbage; radishes; cucumbers; cole-slaw;\r\n    turnips: potatoes; beets; pastry; jellies; jams; nuts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nDIET FOR CONSTIPATION AND OBSTIPATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiet is too often a makeshift for ignorance, or it may be an aid until\r\nthe cause of indigestion is removed; or if not curable, a compromise\r\neffected on the best possible terms for continued existence. We have\r\nfound out the almost universal cause for constipation, obstipation and\r\ncostiveness; therefore until you can have the proper local treatment we\r\nsuggest the following foodstuffs, trusting to the sufferer's judgment\r\nhow much and how often to take the nourishment.\r\n\r\nCoarse foods, stimulants and laxatives unduly excite the bowels. Avoid\r\nthem if possible. Be regular in your habits as to meal-times; eat three\r\ntimes daily, and about an equal amount at each meal.\r\n\r\nYou may take:\r\n\r\n    _Soup_: all kinds of meat and vegetable soup; broth; bouillon.\r\n    Reliable preparations of beef juice, jelly, etc.\r\n\r\n    _Fish_: all kinds, broiled or baked; raw oysters; Doxsee's clam\r\n    preparations.\r\n\r\n    _Meat_: boiled or roasted; poultry; game, etc.\r\n\r\n    _Bread_: graham; brown; whole wheat; corn; rye; ginger;\r\n    shredded-wheat biscuit.\r\n\r\n    _Cereals_: wheaten grits; wheatena; granose; oatmeal porridge;\r\n    Milkine; Horlick's and Mellin's food.\r\n\r\n    _Vegetables_: cauliflower; spinach; beans; asparagus; carrots;\r\n    onions; Brussels sprouts; tomatoes; peas; celery; cabbage.\r\n\r\n    Vegetables should be especially well cooked to render them soft and\r\n    easy of digestion.\r\n\r\n    _Salads_: may be eaten if dressed with a generous supply of olive\r\n    oil.\r\n\r\n    _Dessert_: oranges; melons; prunes; tamarinds; figs; apples (raw or\r\n    baked); pears; plums; peaches; cherries; raisins; stewed fruit;\r\n    honey; blackberries; strawberries; huckleberries; bananas.\r\n\r\n    Some may find it advantageous to eat fruit before or between meals.\r\n\r\n    _Beverages_: water--pure spring water preferably; if this cannot be\r\n    had, get, if possible, distilled water that has been aërated;\r\n    buttermilk; fresh cider; beer; ale.\r\n\r\nMineral waters like Hunyadi, etc., irritate the cause of constipation\r\n(proctitis) in a way similar to cathartic remedies.\r\n\r\nDrink a tumbler or more of hot or cold water an hour before\r\nmeals--preferably hot water. If the hot water be distasteful add a\r\nlittle salt. Drink freely of water about the temperature of 60° during\r\nthe meals, but not for the purpose of emptying the mouth of food.\r\n\r\nOn retiring at night and rising in the morning sip slowly from a\r\nquarter to half pint of water (hot or cold). In the morning be sure to\r\nrinse the mouth free of the accumulated mucus before drinking the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThe use of tea, chocolate, coffee and alcoholic drinks is so abused by\r\nthose even who consider themselves temperate in their habits, that I\r\nrecommend these beverages as remedies only in certain conditions of the\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nAbout four pints of pure water (_i.e._, free from all salts or other\r\nforeign ingredients) should be imbibed in twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n    _Avoid_: sweets; pastry of all kinds; puddings; rice; milk; cheese;\r\n    new bread; nuts; fried foods; rich gravies; farina and sago\r\n    puddings; salt meats; salt fish; veal; goose; liver; hard-boiled\r\n    eggs; pork; tea; tobacco; spirituous liquors; uncooked strawberries\r\n    and huckleberries. Avoid also tomatoes and peaches when not fresh,\r\n    as the acid generated by keeping them a few days is very irritating\r\n    to an already inflamed bowel.\r\n\r\nAvoid substances that would inflame the tissues or cause congestion of\r\nany organ of the body. If the tongue be coated avoid sugar, starchy\r\nfoods and fresh milk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nCOSTIVENESS, DIET, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nTake anything in the way of food which the unconsciously starved person\r\ncan eat without the stomach and intestines protesting too much; any of\r\nthe foods recommended for constipation, indigestion, diarrhea; and take\r\nyet more food if by so doing there is a gain in flesh, after exercising\r\nmuch patience as to time.\r\n\r\nIrrigate the system by imbibing freely of hot and cold water at various\r\nperiods of the day. Good red wine mixed with the water drunk at\r\nmeal-time may serve a good purpose in helping to enrich the blood.\r\n\r\nKeep the pores of the skin open by bathing; and all the functions of\r\nthe body active by exercise, massage, pure air, sunlight, rest, sleep\r\nand seasonable clothing.\r\n\r\nThe large intestines should be kept clean by proper amounts of water\r\ninjected into them. The local cause of all the trouble should be\r\ntreated by a competent physician.\r\n\r\nAnd with all the efforts, continue the treatment long enough to\r\naccomplish some good and then a much longer time to get well. Do not\r\ngive up treatment under which you have improved if it requires one, two\r\nor three years to accomplish what you have so well started out to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\nDIET FOR DIARRHEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nA period marked by constipation, biliousness or poisons generated\r\nwithin or taken into the intestinal canal is often followed by\r\ndiarrhea. Mental excitement will induce it in some persons. More often\r\nman's early and most common malady, proctitis, is the direct or\r\nindirect cause. Some forms of ulceration of the lower bowel induce\r\ndiarrhea. Chronic cases of diarrhea usually follow the decline of\r\nvitality marked by the symptom of Costiveness, which means the\r\ninterruption of all the functions of nutrition. The intestinal canal is\r\nthen like a rubber tube with the contents hurried through it. The whole\r\nsystem is irritable as the result of an accumulation of secondary\r\nsymptoms expressed by the word auto-intoxication.\r\n\r\nThe food should be nutritious and non-irritating to the intestinal\r\ncanal.\r\n\r\nReliance must be placed, in severe cases, on liquid foods and\r\nbeverages.\r\n\r\nThe more solid foods may be taken in limited quantity as the recovery\r\nprogresses. In more acute cases it is well to stop all food for twelve\r\nor twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nYou may take:\r\n\r\n    _Liquid Food and Beverages_: Drink, if possible, pure spring water.\r\n    If this cannot be obtained, sterilize the water, or distil and\r\n    aërate it; it must be pure and soft. Better still: drink toast- or\r\n    rice-water; kefyr, four days old; koumiss; lactic-acid water;\r\n    zoolak; egg lemonade; sterilized milk with one third lime-water;\r\n    whortleberry wine; acorn cocoa; unfermented grape-juice.\r\n\r\n    _Soup_: chicken; mutton; clam; oyster broth; Doxsee's clam-juice;\r\n    bouillon; Milkine; Horlick's and Mellin's food.\r\n\r\n    _Meat_: minced chicken; scraped beef; roast fowl; beef steak;\r\n    fillet of beef; raw beef; sweetbread; raw oysters.\r\n\r\n    _Eggs_: lightly boiled, poached.\r\n\r\n    _Cereals and Fruit_: grapes at all hours, eaten without seeds or\r\n    skin; arrowroot; tapioca; sago; barley mush; macaroni; rice boiled\r\n    with milk; milk toast; dry toast; crackers; junket; bread pudding;\r\n    egg pudding, not sweetened; hasty pudding, with flour and milk;\r\n    mashed potatoes.\r\n\r\n    _Avoid_: pork; veal; nuts; salt meats; fish; fried foods; sugary\r\n    foods; fruits, cooked or raw; oatmeal; brown and graham bread; new\r\n    bread; vegetables; and most soups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA FINAL WORD TO THOSE TO WHOM I HAVE DEDICATED THIS BOOK.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is very evident from the perusal of this work that the symptoms of\r\nproctitis, both general and local, proceed from no trifling disease;\r\nand also that the disease may have existed for a very long time,\r\nperhaps as much as twenty, forty or more years. During the greater part\r\nof its existence all sorts of medication have been tried to allay this\r\nor that annoying prominent symptom with a hope of a cure.\r\n\r\nAt the congress of physicians that met in Paris in 1900, one of the\r\nsubjects discussed was chronic constipation and their \"wise\" conclusion\r\nwas that man needed more grease, therefore they mourned the loss of the\r\nfrying-pan.\r\n\r\nSymptoms induced by proctitis in various parts of the body are often\r\naccompanied by painful local symptoms, called piles or a \"touch of the\r\npiles.\" Then local medication is added to the general treatment, and as\r\nusual matters go from bad to worse. Physicians consulted have been\r\nhonest and kind, but with all their advice the increasing troubles\r\ncontinue. Your demands grow more pressing on your doctor and as a last\r\nresort he mentions a surgical operation for the removal of one or more\r\npainful local symptoms. The fright is sufficient in most cases to make\r\nthe sufferer endure the ills he has rather than flee to others he knows\r\nnot, even risking life itself. Others more bold submit to an\r\nexamination by the surgeon, which proves so painful at the time and\r\ncauses so much subsequent suffering that they are now really content\r\nnot to importune any more for help.\r\n\r\nA few in desperation make up their minds to have the local anal symptom\r\nremoved regardless of the final result.\r\n\r\nThus millions of human beings have suffered and died and countless\r\nnumbers are enduring the ills they have, not knowing of a rational and\r\nhumane system of treatment; a treatment that not only removes the\r\nnumerous annoying symptoms, but _the cause as well_; a system that will\r\nstand the test of time, _of common-sense_, _of constant investigation_\r\nto know the _why_ and _wherefore_ of both disease and treatment.\r\n\r\nFor over twenty years I have concerned myself with this and allied\r\nailments, and have treated--without the use of the knife--all cases of\r\npiles, polypus, fissure, stricture, ulcerations, etc. At the present\r\ntime physicians are writing me in this wise: \"I want to take a course\r\nof instruction from you. I have performed some successful surgical\r\noperations on the rectum, but it is not profitable; the people will not\r\nsubmit to it.\" Another writes: \"Your treatment of hemorrhoids has been\r\nbrought to my notice by my friend and patient, Mr. ----.  The method\r\nyou practise is certainly an ideal one and seems to have been most\r\nsuccessful in your hands, and I would like to adopt it.\"\r\n\r\nTo physicians and laymen interested, I will send, for twenty-five\r\ncents, my treatise on Diseases of the Anus and Rectum (entitled _How to\r\nBecome Strong_). It contains over 100 anatomical illustrations, and 125\r\ntestimonials, and forms, therefore, a valuable adjunct to this volume.\r\n\r\nAll whose testimonials appear in the 64-page book suffered from\r\nproctitis to a greater or less extent and with the exception of a few\r\nall suffered from chronic constipation, indigestion, etc.\r\n\r\nSurgeons usually desire strong and vigorous patients. The author asks\r\nmerely for an intelligent patient, or for some one to direct the home\r\nattention necessary between treatments.\r\n\r\nThis book, as well as the one entitled _How to Become Strong_, and the\r\nauthor's other printed instructions, are the result of his desire to\r\nmake his patients intelligent on the subject of the disease and\r\nsymptoms for which they seek his assistance. They truly cannot know too\r\nmuch for their own good in this regard; an ignorant patient can not do\r\njustice either to himself or to his physician. Those who have tried all\r\nthe fads and so-called cures in order to relieve their troubles will\r\ncertainly appreciate what I have here presented for their study. With\r\nenlightenment comes the desire to set things right. So I have no appeal\r\nto make to the lazy: I shall leave them to their ills and their pills.\r\nAnd for those who appreciate the beauty of cleanliness, both external\r\nand internal, I shall write another book on that subject, including a\r\nprophecy for coming generations. Eternal vigilance is the price we must\r\npay if we would enjoy the highest physical, mental and spiritual\r\nexpression of our personalities.\r\n\r\nThanking the indulgent reader who has read my description of Intestinal\r\nIlls, I advise him to rewrite it in his own organism, if not in\r\nprinter's ink: the world will be better for it!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTESTINAL ILLS.\r\n\r\nNO. 1.\r\n\r\nCHRONIC CONSTIPATION AND THE USE OF THE ENEMA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Civilized\" man is the victim, by inheritance from distant ancestors,\r\nof undesirable characteristics, traits, and tendencies. While, during\r\nthe long process of evolution, some of the cruder features of the\r\nphysical and mental traits have been refined or eliminated, the modern\r\nman still clings to certain habits inherited from his wholly\r\nanimalistic days. Even as the man of that day, so the man of to-day\r\neats far too much and far too frequently.\r\n\r\nTo the scientific eye, your capacious digestive apparatus is a\r\npsycho-physical exhibit of the racial proclivity to overeat. Here, in\r\nthis exhibit, the race's inordinate craving for food and drink, its\r\ngluttonous thought, have embodied themselves; and this exhibit, this\r\napparatus, is accordingly not merely physical, but also psychical, for\r\nits sub-conscious outreach for \"more and always more\" is only too\r\napparent. Man's stomach and bowels are too much like those of a mere\r\nanimal, and are the source of nine-tenths of his ills.\r\n\r\nAll great consumers of foodstuffs, Nature declares, should walk on all\r\nfours; if you will persist in walking on your hind legs, you will have\r\nto pay the penalty. You will, moreover, contract other habits not\r\nconducive to real animal health. And, as Nature predicted, man's social\r\ncustoms to-day are out of all accord with gluttonous feeding; he, as\r\nwell as his capacious bowels, suffers the consequences of his excessive\r\nfeeding, and this suffering leads him to adopt artificial means for\r\nrelief or escape. Up-to-date civilization has constrained man to adopt\r\na cooped-up existence, one that shuts out, to a great extent, sunshine\r\nand air; an existence, moreover, that involves but a limited amount of\r\nexercise. How, then, can it be otherwise than--gormand that he is--that\r\nhe should fare ill with this gluttonous, mammoth digestive canal?\r\n\r\nMan is not as yet more than half human, and he will not become truly\r\nhuman until he makes more use of the upper lobes of his brain, nor\r\nuntil the spiritual part of his nature becomes dominant. When that day\r\ndawns he will have a corresponding evolution of the physical body,\r\nespecially of the gastro-intestinal canal. Some one has sagely said\r\nthat man's brain is a mere extension of his intestinal canal. Well,\r\npossibly by and by the intestinal canal may become an extension of a\r\nspiritually awakened mind, with all its dominating influence over the\r\nphysical body. Surely the evolutional trend from animal to complete\r\nmanhood may be aided by intelligent foresight as to bodily care and\r\nhygiene.\r\n\r\nCooped up like a canary bird, or penned up and fattening like a hog,\r\nwith his enormous eating capacity and vast intestinal storage space,\r\npoor man has matters made worse by having his several orifices liable\r\nto inflammatory invasions. He does not seem able to escape from his\r\nenemies anywhere.\r\n\r\nThe mucous membrane lining the orifices of the body is nothing more\r\nthan the skin turned in to line canals for air, gases, liquids, and\r\nsolids to pass in and out in order to keep up the physio-logical\r\nfunctions of the body. Very rarely, indeed, do we find, from childhood\r\nto old age, the orifice of the intestinal sewer otherwise than\r\nchronically inflamed, the invasion extending, moreover, the whole\r\nlength of the rectum for some distance into the sigmoid colon.\r\n\r\nIt is no trifling matter to have the function of some thirty feet of\r\nthe gastro-intestinal tract disturbed, especially of the large\r\nintestine--some five feet in length, two and a half inches in diameter\r\nin not a few sections.\r\n\r\nAlmost without exception, we find the lower portion of the intestinal\r\nsewer the seat of chronic inflammation that extends into the sigmoid\r\ncolon; and, as an inevitable result of the inflammation, contraction\r\nmore or less permanent has taken place in the circular and longitudinal\r\nmuscular bands that form its structure. The constriction is especially\r\nsevere at the junction of the rectum with the sigmoid colon, where it\r\nflexes upon itself in the region where the bore of the rectum is less.\r\nThe comparative shutting up of the caliber of the upper end of the\r\nrectum and lower portion of the sigmoid colon occasions undue retention\r\nof the feces and gases which accumulate, and in accumulating dislocate\r\nvarious portions of the large intestine, thus forming pouches, sacks,\r\nreservoirs, prolapse, etc., which hold the products of putrefaction as\r\nwell as the irritating, poisonous mucus thrown out from the inflamed\r\ntissue.\r\n\r\nI regard the occlusion of the upper portion of the rectum, and\r\nespecially of the region involved in the flexure of the bowel, as the\r\nmost usual seat and source of constipation. Not so very long ago it was\r\nthe custom to stretch the sphincter muscles for the \"cure\" of\r\nconstipation; at the present time the \"cure\" is found in the valves of\r\nthe middle lower portion of the rectum. The folly of these \"cures\"\r\nbecomes apparent when we understand that the parts treated were neither\r\nthe seat nor the source of constipation. I have always regarded great\r\nretention of feces in the rectum as _impaction_ in a delivery canal,\r\ndue to contraction of the anal muscles, not as constipation, which can\r\nonly take place in the temporary storage-place--the sigmoid flexure.\r\nThe lower two-thirds of the rectum plays no part in constipation of the\r\nbowels.\r\n\r\nForm a manikin, made out of very thin, soft rubber tubing, to represent\r\nthe stomach and small and large intestine, holding the various parts in\r\nplace with elastic bands, and cotton to represent fat. When all\r\nportions are properly and anatomically placed close the lower eight or\r\nten inches of the manikin, representing the lower portion of the\r\nsigmoid colon, rectum, and anus, just as tightly as we should find it\r\nclosed in sufferers from chronically acute proctitis and colitis. Now\r\ninsert at the stomach portion of the manikin a generous amount of man's\r\nusual mixture of foodstuffs and liquids, and repeat the supply three or\r\nfour times during the day (without any previous attempts at cleansing),\r\nand then note the fermentative and putrefactive changes that take\r\nplace; the ensuing bacterial poisons and the great volume of poisonous\r\ngases--all of which occasion squirming, twisting movements of the\r\nmanikin as dislocations here and there occur, as pouches and reservoirs\r\ndevelop, as the walls become distended with gas and putrid substance;\r\nand then, time elapsing, the usual foodstuffs are added to the foul\r\nmass within! Now, if there is any pity in your soul, you medical man,\r\nfor the enfouled and deformed human manikin, you will want to wash it\r\nout with cleansing water before its structure comes to an untimely end.\r\nWe medical men all know the numerous and grave symptoms exhibited by\r\none or more organs of the body, or by all of them, from the persistent\r\nwork of the deleterious gases and bacterial poisons on the system--a\r\nwork going on for years, finally placing the victim beyond medical aid.\r\nAll of us are agreed that the capacious gastro-intestinal canal should\r\nbe clean. What, I submit, is the best means of keeping clean this long,\r\nlarge, tortuous, spacious, valved and flexed canal--a canal that\r\ndisease has here and there pouched, dislocated, bagged, reservoired; a\r\ncanal at whose lower end a great cesspool exists; that, like other\r\nportions of the gut, is never empty and clean--what is the best means\r\nbut a flushing with copious amount of water?\r\n\r\nProctitis or colitis is a very serious disease; like a railroad injury,\r\nit is found, on examination, to be much worse than appearances at first\r\nindicated.\r\n\r\nA physician who prescribes for a case of chronic constipation or\r\ndiarrhea without first examining the sufferer for proctitis and\r\ncolitis, is either ignorant or does wilful harm to his patient and\r\ninjury to his practice. The abominable, aboriginal and almost universal\r\ncustom at the present time of giving some physic to \"cleanse\" the\r\ngastro-intestinal canal is in every respect a deplorable mistake for a\r\nconscientious doctor to make.\r\n\r\nMany persons suffering from chronic constipation drink very little or\r\nno water. As a consequence, they are a sort of dirty, dried-up plant,\r\nwith but little juice of life in them.\r\n\r\nOthers, again, equally unclean, or more so, take a moderate amount of\r\nfluid every day, and present a more or less roly-poly appearance, with\r\nconsiderable abdominal distention, due to malnutrition and gases. Of\r\ncourse, their eyes, skin, tongue, breath, and lack of vim and vigor\r\ntell the story of a long process of self-poisoning, with every now and\r\nthen the eventuation of a storm of foulness, called a bilious\r\nattack--meaning an overflow of filth. Death often brings about a\r\nradical change in such poisoned bodies.\r\n\r\nNow, what can a prescriber of a gastro-intestinal ejector expect to\r\naccomplish by disturbing the maleconomy of this apparatus? Usually he\r\nexpects that considerable trouble will ensue; consequently, he will add\r\nbelladonna or some other soothing drug to mitigate the act of expulsion.\r\nThe ejector (called laxative, purgative, cathartic) occasions\r\nirritation, which sets up twisting, writhing, rumbling of the bowels,\r\naccompanied with a shower of liquid into the canal (as tears fill the\r\neyes from the effects of sand or a blow), which liquid mingles again\r\nwith the putrid refuse materials, from which it had been recently\r\nabsorbed, and, mingling, proceeds to fill up the normal and abnormal\r\nspaces just described, _to be again reabsorbed into the system_. Oh,\r\nthe foulness of it all! The spirits of the departed, as well as the\r\nstill incarnate patients, demand of the healing art safe and sane\r\nhygienic methods of cure. _The enema, regularly and properly used, is\r\nthe remedy par excellence._\r\n\r\nThose that suffer from chronic constipation are usually deficient in\r\nthe quantity and quality of intestinal secretions. Physic increases the\r\ndepletion of the intestinal juices. Of the watery secretion forced into\r\nthe bowels, four-fifths are reabsorbed into the system, plus poisons\r\nand filth. The system soon becomes accustomed to the irritation of\r\ndrugs, and requires an ever-increasing amount. These irritate and\r\nincrease the chronic inflammation of the lower bowel, often to the\r\nextent of a discharge of blood.\r\n\r\nStraining effort to induce defecation is injurious. The use of massage,\r\nof vibratory exercises, of electricity; the spraying of cold water on\r\nthe abdomen, etc.,--none of them are calculated to remove or even to\r\nrelieve the proctitis and colitis.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of the water used for an enema should be about one\r\nhundred degrees. It should be taken at least twice daily, preferably on\r\nretiring at night and soon after breakfast, at regular times, if\r\npossible. Such practice obviates the need of large injections.\r\n\r\nIn beginning the use of the enema it is well to inject from a half to a\r\npint of water, and expel it. This constitutes a preliminary injection.\r\nFrequently it is desirable to take another preliminary injection before\r\ntaking the large one, which latter is variously called \"flushing the\r\ncolon,\" \"taking an enema,\" \"taking an internal bath\" or \"a washout,\"\r\netc. It is essential first to get rid of the feces and gases in the\r\nrectum, so that they be not sent back when you proceed to flush the\r\ncolon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNO. 2.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIONS TO THE USE OF ENEMA ANSWERED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe privilege of raising objections belongs to the ignorant as well as\r\nto the intelligent. But the objector is under as great obligations to\r\nstate his reasons as the advocate.\r\n\r\nThe _first_ plausible objection to the use of the enema is that it is\r\nnot natural.\r\n\r\nAdmitting this charge, I should say that, inasmuch as proctitis,\r\ncolitis, and constipation are unnatural, the use of a preternatural or,\r\nin other words, a rational means to overcome the consequences of these\r\ndiseases is imperative. The enema is such a means.\r\n\r\nCan any one that suffers from proctitis, etc., have a natural stool?\r\nUnnatural conditions require preternatural aids, as we all know. The\r\ninjected water dilates the constricted portion of the gut and arouses a\r\nrevulsive impulse to expel the invading water. In obeying this impulse\r\nthe imprisoned feces, gases, etc., are ejected with the water.\r\n\r\nIt may be unnatural to put water into the rectum, etc., but once there\r\nits expulsion from healthy bowels would be quite natural. No natural\r\naction can be expected from unhealthy bowels; they do the best they can\r\nunder the circumstances. Eye-glasses, false teeth, crutches, etc., are\r\nunnatural but invaluable aids, but no more so than is the enema as a\r\nmeans of relief from overloaded bowels. The enema, moreover, be it\r\nnoted, not only aids the system by relieving it of its loads; it\r\ncleanses and soothes an organ that must be kept at work and perform its\r\nfunctions even when invaded by disease.\r\n\r\nSurely it is unhygienic and irrational to ignore the valuable service\r\nof the enema in cases in which the bowels are in an unnatural\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nThe _second_ objection is that the water will wash away the mucus from\r\nthe mucous membrane of the bowels and leave them dry and parched, and\r\nthus apt to crack and break in two. I would remind the objector that,\r\nsince about 75 per cent. of the normal feces is water, it seems strange\r\nthat so great a quantity of water in contact with the mucous surface of\r\nthe bowels should not also cause dryness.\r\n\r\nThe integument of the body and that of the mucous membrane are similar\r\nin structure, yet whoever had a fear of producing dryness of the skin\r\nby much application of water? The mucous membrane is simply the skin\r\nturned inward; and since it is much more vascular it is less apt to\r\nbecome dry--if, indeed, its dryness were at all possible. The objector\r\nshould also remember that the body is composed of over 80 per cent. of\r\nwater--an organism not to be made dry or parched by the application of\r\nwater to the skin or to the mucous membrane two or three times a day.\r\n\r\nThe mucous membrane of the lower bowel is not unlike that of the mouth,\r\nthroat, or stomach. Do you realize how often the upper end of the\r\nintestinal canal is washed or bathed daily with liquids, soft and hard\r\ndrinks, hot and cold, especially by those who have formed the drink\r\nhabit instead of the enema habit?\r\n\r\nThey have no fear of drying the mucous membrane thereby; but if you can\r\ninstil this fear they will increase the quantity with pleasure.\r\n\r\nThis second objection, being the result of too vivid an imagination and\r\ntoo little reflection, is a very nonsensical objection indeed.\r\n\r\nA _third_ objection is that if you begin the use of the enema you will\r\nhave to continue its use; you can't stop, and, lo and behold! the enema\r\nhabit is formed--a new habit in addition to the many habits civilized\r\nman is already carrying; the constipated habit, the physic habit, the\r\nsand, bran, sawdust-food habit, the muscular peristaltic habit,\r\netc.--and with all these habits the poor victim of proctitis and\r\nintestinal foulness wonders that he is alive.\r\n\r\nUsually the first symptom of proctitis is constipation, and for relief\r\nthe enema habit should be formed and continued while the constipation\r\nremains. When the proper means are found to remove the intestinal\r\ninflammation--proctitis and colitis--then the constipation will\r\ndisappear, and with its disappearance the enema habit can be\r\ndiscontinued. But let it be well noted that the enema is itself an aid\r\nin curing the cause, an aid superior to any other at our command. A\r\ncleanly habit ought not to be an objectionable one, especially in cases\r\nin which it is most needed to prevent toxic substances from entering\r\nthe system.\r\n\r\nA _fourth_ objection is that after taking the first enema the constipation\r\nis worse.\r\n\r\nWith many persons a certain amount of undue accumulation of feces will\r\nexcite a sufficient muscular effort of the gut to force the dried mass\r\nthrough the proctitis- and colitis-strictured bowels. This unnatural\r\neffort may occur once a day or once in two or three days, and has\r\ndoubtless been a habit of many years' duration.\r\n\r\nTo introduce a new order of conduct on the part of the bowels requires\r\ntime. If the bowels have been in the habit of expelling feces in the\r\nmorning, and an enema were taken the night before, there might be no\r\ndesire to stool the next morning because of the fact that the bulk or\r\naccumulated mass of excrement was no longer there to create a vigorous\r\ncall or impulse for defecation.\r\n\r\nBut we have found the extent of local damage and reflex to the organs,\r\nand more especially the constant absorption of poisons into the system,\r\ndue to the presence of feces. It is for this reason that the\r\nelimination of feces twice or thrice in twenty-four hours is advised.\r\nThe condition for which an enema is used is one of disturbance and\r\npoison to the system. It is, therefore, a most unnatural condition.\r\nWhat is more rational, consequently, than to employ an \"unnatural\" yet\r\nnot harmful means to bring about a more normal condition, one free from\r\npoisoning and irritating consequences?\r\n\r\nA _fifth_ objection is made by those who have as a symptom of proctitis\r\na large development of pile tumors or hemorrhoids (distended mucous\r\nmembrane). The objection is that at times these tumors or sacs prolapse\r\nvery freely during the act of expelling the injected water. But this\r\nprolapse occurs in many cases whether water is used or not.\r\n\r\nA certain amount of anal irritation caused by the passage of feces\r\noccurs, causing contraction of the circular muscular tissue that forms\r\nthe anal and rectal canal, also of the longitudinal muscular bands and\r\nthe levator muscles of the organs. The enema lessens or entirely\r\ndiminishes the irritation of passing feces, and the natural result is\r\nthat the serum-filled sacs, called piles, and the tissue loosened by\r\nthe inflammatory product will more readily prolapse during the act of\r\ndefecating. It is simply a choice between irritation of the stool\r\nkeeping the tissue up and no irritation permitting a prolapse.\r\n\r\nOf course, if there be no expulsion of feces and water the stretched or\r\ndilated sacs may keep their places in the rectum. And then again, the\r\nenema may be used for quite a period, when all at once a large prolapse\r\nof sacculated mucous membrane occurs, and the enema is thought to be\r\nthe cause of it. That this is not the cause, let it be remembered that\r\nin all cases of proctitis the chronic inflammation is apt to become\r\nsubacute or acute, and that this intense engorgement and enlargement of\r\nthe tissue with blood and the increased fever in the parts often result\r\nin prolapse at any time, especially at times of convulsive effort at\r\nevacuation.\r\n\r\nWhatever follows the proper use of an enema, even though what follows\r\nbe annoying, should not be blamed on the enema, for its action is most\r\nkindly, lessening as it does the irritation that otherwise would be\r\nmore severe when the feces pass through a disease-constricted canal.\r\n\r\nThe _sixth_ objection is that the use of the enema will weaken the\r\nbowels, which are already too \"weak\" to expel their contents. \"Atony,\r\nparalysis, fatty degeneration of the gut, are bad enough,\" say these\r\nobjectors, \"without having an enema increase their uselessness.\"\r\nDiagnosis wrong and objection groundless.\r\n\r\nDistend and contract an organ for a short time two or three times a\r\nday, and it will gain in strength from the exercise. Every one knows\r\nthat this is the case. What more gentle means of exercising the large\r\nintestines than by the enema?\r\n\r\nBut the truth of the matter is that in all cases of proctitis and\r\nconstipation the diseased portion of the gut is too active in its\r\nmuscular movements, contracting spasmodically, as it does, at even the\r\nsuggestion or suspicion of feces near it. Every impulse of the bowels\r\nabove the constricted section to force the feces down through the\r\nclosed bore only intensifies the spasmodic action and increases the\r\nmuscular obstruction, compelling the victim to resort to some one of\r\nthe many drastic means of relief.\r\n\r\nThe enema does no more than kindly to dilate the constricted region,\r\nwhich, when dilated, evokes a harmonious concerted action of all the\r\nnerves and muscles to pass along and down the burden of feces, which,\r\nwithout the aid of a flood of water, they had been incapable of moving,\r\nand would have had to leave to poison the system.\r\n\r\nThe _seventh_ objection is quite naive: \"Inasmuch as the Indians of\r\nthis country had no use for the enema, why should we resort to it?\"\r\n\r\nThe all-sufficient answer to this objection is that the Indians lived a\r\nnatural life, while ours is artificial. Much can be said on this point,\r\nbut the reader is surely rational enough to follow out the distinction\r\nsuggested. Our lives are much more important than were the lives of the\r\naborigines of this country, and our \"demands of Nature\" are more\r\nexigent. If your life is of no greater value than theirs, for leisure's\r\nsake don't use the enema! You will be taking too much trouble. It\r\nreally should seem that the cleanliness of the skin and mucous\r\nmembrane, the care we take of our bodies, is an indication and measure\r\nof our sense of refinement. An ancient Scripture hath it: \"Let those\r\nthat are filthy, be filthy still.\" It all depends upon how you wish to\r\nbe classed--with the filthy or the cleanly.\r\n\r\nThe _eighth_ objection to be noted is the fear of \"poking things\"\r\n(points of instruments) \"into the rectum.\"\r\n\r\nThis looks like a real objection. No healthy nor even unhealthy organ,\r\nfor that matter, should be \"abused.\" And what seems more likely to\r\ncause it trouble than to poke a hard or soft rubber point or tube\r\nthrough its vent in opposition to its bent or inclination? Still, the\r\nmuscles of the vent are strong, and they soon accommodate themselves to\r\nthe practice. Their slight disinclination is not to be considered\r\nalongside of the relief and cure you effect by the use of the enema.\r\n\r\nHave no fear that the point will occasion disease when intelligently\r\nused. Always see to it that the point is scrupulously clean. Those made\r\nof hard rubber or metal can be kept so without effort.\r\n\r\nSoft rubber points are always foul and dangerous, especially after they\r\nare used a few times. A good rule is never to put a point higher in the\r\nbowel than is absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\nThe _ninth_ objection seems serious. It is that in taking an enema the\r\nwater escaping from the syringe point will injure the mucous membrane\r\nwhere the jet strikes. But on examination this objection falls to the\r\nground, for it stands to reason the jet cannot directly hit the surface\r\nfor more than a moment. Immediately thereafter the accumulation of\r\nwater will force the jet to spend its energy on the increasing volume,\r\nto lift it out of the way so that the continuous inflow may find room.\r\n\r\nBut even were it possible for the jet to strike a definite section of\r\nthe mucous membrane during the taking of the enema, it could do no harm\r\nprovided the water be at the proper temperature. And this is true even\r\nif a hydrant pressure be used. Not a few persons use the hydrant\r\npressure of their houses in taking an enema. For a really successful\r\nflushing of the colon a considerable pressure is requisite to force the\r\nvolume up and along a distance of five feet, especially when sitting\r\nupright. But it is folly to use a long syringe point, since it is like\r\nintroducing one canal into another for the purpose of cleansing it.\r\nTherefore, have no fear from the use of proper syringe points; the jet\r\nof water will not hurt the mucous membrane. My professional brethren at\r\nleast ought to know that the idea of such harm is sheer nonsense.\r\n\r\nThe _tenth_ objection to using an enema is in being obliged to use it\r\nfrom the fact of having such a disease as chronic inflammation of the\r\nrectum and colon. Every victim hates to be compelled to do a thing, and\r\nthe victim of proctitis and colitis is no exception to the rule. In\r\nfact, he is beginning to realize that unless he uses it his system will\r\nbe poisoned by the absorption of the sewage waste. Let the victim\r\nobject to the disease that necessitates the use of the enema and he\r\nwill shortly be well. Then this objection to the use of the enema will\r\nindeed be the most important of all.\r\n\r\nThe _eleventh_ objection, and the most ridiculous of all, is that it\r\nrequires too much time to take the enema twice or thrice daily.\r\n\r\nI lose all patience with persons urging this objection. Those that have\r\nlittle or no system with their daily duties seldom have time to do\r\nanything of importance. They suffer from \"haphazarditis,\" a very\r\ndifficult disease to cure, and they are in many cases hopeless. Usually\r\nthey are an uncleanly lot of people, full of good intentions, but their\r\nintentions though taken often, seldom operate as an antidote to\r\nfoulness. Their one sigh the livelong day is: \"Oh, could we be like\r\nbirds that can stool while on the wing or on foot!\" This feat of\r\ntime-saving being hardly possible in the present incarnation and order\r\nof society, they content themselves with making a storehouse out of the\r\nintestinal canal for an indefinite length of time as they concern\r\nthemselves with external affairs of work or sport. A sorry lot they are\r\nindeed when they are laid up for repairs. Many doctors, I am sorry to\r\nsay, encourage with a chuckle this foolish practice. \"Any time to stool\r\nyou can manage to get, so that you stool at least once a day, or once\r\nin every two or three days; stool when it is normal for you to do so.\"\r\nThis criminal advice just suits the sleepy, the lazy, or the \"awfully\r\nbusy.\"\r\n\r\nThe American habit of doing things en masse, of handling things in\r\nlarge quantities or in bulk, has something to do with their don't care\r\nconstipated habit. Small evacuations two or three times a day seem too\r\nmuch like small business, which, of course, is a waste of precious\r\ntime. Wholesaling, laziness, lack of system, hurry, are the cause of\r\ngood-for-nothingness of body and mind. _It should never be too much\r\ntrouble to restore the lost impulse for stooling twice or thrice\r\ndaily._\r\n\r\nIs it a small matter to have the main sewer of a city partly or\r\nentirely closed, or the main sewer pipe of a dwelling stopped up? Think\r\nof the dire results, notwithstanding that the windows and doors remain\r\nwide open! The Board of Health would soon deal with the negligent\r\nofficial or landlord. With very few exceptions, \"civilized\" men, women,\r\nand children are negligent and niggardly caretakers of the human\r\ndwelling place--the marvellous body of man. \"Lack of time,\" \"haven't\r\nthe time,\" or \"no time,\" is the excuse they give themselves and others.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the numberless victims around them, none of these\r\nnegligent and niggardly ones seem to get alarmed until the secondary\r\nsymptoms, such as indigestion, gout, rheumatism, or disease of some\r\nvital organ, are sufficiently annoying to demand attention. But I have\r\nfull faith in humanity. Man does the best he knows how, as a general\r\nrule. But often he doesn't know how; he needs enlightening.\r\n\r\nThe hints I have given will, I am confident, be considered and acted\r\nupon by all to whose attention they are brought, for by acting upon\r\nthem, normal bodies and minds will result, and blessings attained\r\nheretofore considered impossible. Normal health depends on right doing\r\nand being. Eternal vigilance is the price to be paid for the attainment\r\nand maintenance of the goal of normal life and progress. Eliminate all\r\nwaste material from the body and all shifty vermin from the mind, and\r\nthe millennium for all things in the universe will soon dawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURTEEN REASONS\r\n\r\nWHY WE SHOULD BATHE INTERNALLY AS WELL AS EXTERNALLY\r\n\r\n\r\n 1. Because very few persons are free from chronic inflammation of the\r\nanus, rectum, and sigmoid flexure, which causes contraction of the\r\ncaliber of the organs.\r\n\r\n 2. None escape self-poisoning from the gastro-intestinal canal. Many\r\nare constantly being poisoned from the entrance of bacterial and other\r\ntoxic substances into the system.\r\n\r\n 3. Nine-tenths of the ills that afflict mankind have their origin in a\r\nfoul digestive apparatus and a consequently poisoned body.\r\n\r\n 4. Disease of the anus, rectum, and sigmoid flexure results in from\r\ntwo-thirds to three-fourths of the feces being daily absorbed into the\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n 5. Feces unduly retained become very foul or malodorous. If the feces\r\nof birds and domestic fowls and animals were as obnoxious as that\r\nusually ejected by man their discharges would require immediate removal\r\nfrom human neighborhoods.\r\n\r\n 6. Man is the only creature that has formed the habit of making a fecal\r\ncesspool of his large intestine; hence his diseases of many varieties.\r\nThere is nothing wholesome about him and he is quite destitute of vim,\r\nvigor, and push. The fecal poisoning of his parents is stamped upon\r\nhim, and the unhygienic condition of his bowels makes matters worse.\r\n\r\n 7. Man needs to form the habit of stooling as frequently as birds,\r\nfowls, and quadrupeds--at least as many times in twenty-four hours as\r\nhe partakes of food.\r\n\r\n 8. Making a reservoir of the lower bowels is not a time-saving habit,\r\nbut, on the contrary, a breeder of many poisons, causing all sorts of\r\nacute and chronic diseases, which demand much time and attention, as\r\ncountless numbers know to their sorrow.\r\n\r\n 9. You are a factor in the social and business world; then why not\r\nlook, feel, and be your best by simply adopting internal hygienic\r\nmeasures?\r\n\r\n10. By the use of the Internal J.B.L. Cascade Bath you can secure two\r\nor three stools a day, as desired; and while you are preventing\r\nself-poisoning you are regaining a normal habit and natural health,\r\nwhich for so many years and generations have been denied you. Do not\r\nlonger perpetuate the dire results of a foul alimentary canal and\r\nconsequently diseased body.\r\n\r\n11. All desire to be strong and healthy, and many would add beauty of\r\nform and complexion, which is also commendable. This can be attained by\r\npreventing disease through hygienic attention and the proper use of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n12. The gastro-intestinal canal is a physiological, moving food supply\r\nfor the body, and, like any other vessel that has contained fermenting\r\nsubstances, it should be emptied and cleaned before a fresh supply is\r\nput into it. This is only a sensible, reasonable, and cleanly duty to\r\none's self.\r\n\r\n13. Who can fear being made sick by adopting cleanly habits? You have\r\nperhaps tried all other means to keep well, and have failed; now try\r\nintestinal cleanliness--a method you should have thought of long ago.\r\n\r\n14. Every one desires to avoid surgery, the taking of numerous\r\nmedicines, and the spending of money in that way--and they _can_ be\r\navoided if you keep _clean_, both internally and externally.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\r\nYou're Not Healthy Unless\r\nYou're Clean INSIDE\r\n\r\nAnd the one way to real internal cleanliness--by which you are\r\nprotected against ninety per cent of all human ailments--is through\r\n_proper_ internal bathing, with plain antiseptic warm water.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing unusual about this treatment--no drugs, no\r\ndieting--nothing but the correct application of Nature's own cleanser.\r\nBut only since the invention of the J.B.L. Cascade has a means for\r\n_proper_ internal bathing existed.\r\n\r\nOnly one treatment is known for actually cleansing the colon without\r\nthe aid of elaborate surgical apparatus. This is\r\n\r\n    THE INTERNAL BATH\r\n    By Means of the\r\n    J.B.L. Cascade\r\n\r\nProf. Metchnikoff, Europe's leading authority on intestinal conditions,\r\nis quoted as saying that, if the colon and its poisonous contents were\r\nremovable, people would live in good health to twice the present\r\naverage of human life.\r\n\r\nDr. A. Wilfred Hall, Ph.D., L.L.D., and W. E. Forest, B.D., M.D., two\r\nworld-famous authorities on internal bathing, are among the thousands\r\nof physicians who have given their hearty and active endorsement and\r\nsupport to the J.B.L. Cascade treatment.\r\n\r\nFully half a million men and women and children now use this real boon\r\nto humanity--most of them in accordance with their doctor's orders.\r\n\r\n    LET DR. TYRRELL ADVISE YOU\r\n\r\nDr. Tyrrell is always very glad of an opportunity to consult freely\r\nwith anyone who writes him--and at no expense or obligation whatever.\r\nDescribe your case to him and he gives you his promise that you will\r\nlearn facts about yourself which you will realize are of vital\r\nimportance. You will also receive his book, \"The What, the Why, the\r\nWay,\" which is a most interesting treatise on internal bathing.\r\nConsultation with Dr. Tyrrell involves no obligation.\r\n\r\nCHARLES A. TYRRELL, M.D.\r\n134 W. 65th Street,        New York\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIF YOU SUFFER FROM ROUGH, SCALY, CRACKED SKIN\r\n\r\nIf You Value a Good Complexion\r\n\r\nDr. Tyrrell's Health Soap\r\n\r\nEffectually Disposes of Troubles. It\r\nIs Refreshing, Purifying, Invigorating\r\n\r\nAmong the necessities of life there is one to which few people pay the\r\nattention they ought, and that is Soap. Yet it is undoubtedly a most\r\nimportant matter, for the skin is a very delicate and sensitive organ,\r\nand the constant application of impure or inferior Soaps injures its\r\ntexture, and gives rise to numerous cutaneous troubles. Most people are\r\ncontent, so long as it appeals to the eye and the sense of smell,\r\nwithout stopping to consider that perfumes may be employed to hide\r\ndefects.\r\n\r\nDr. Tyrrell has given this matter long and profound consideration and\r\nnow offers to the public a SOAP that leaves nothing to be desired. It\r\nis not only absolutely free from any deleterious substance, but is a\r\nperfect antiseptic and healing soap. Its use thoroughly cleanses and\r\ninvigorates the skin, keeps it soft, flexible and healthy, and\r\neffectually prevents rough, cracked and scaly conditions. It is\r\ninvaluable for TAN, FRECKLES, SUNBURN, Etc., and is a perfect hygienic\r\nsafeguard against cutaneous disorders. It is a positive pleasure to use\r\nit for the toilet or bath, as it leaves such a grateful, refreshing\r\nafter-effect.\r\n\r\nAs a SHAVING SOAP it is unequalled, absolutely preventing those\r\ndisagreeable results that frequently follow the use of impure soap.\r\n\r\n25 Cents Per Cake\r\n\r\nManufactured solely by\r\nCHARLES A. TYRRELL, M.D.\r\nFormerly President of\r\nTyrrell Hygienic Institute\r\n134 W. 65th Street, New York City\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSufferers from Catarrh\r\n\r\nTHERE IS GLORIOUS NEWS FOR YOU.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo matter how much you may suffer from that most distressing and\r\ninconvenient complaint, a speedy and effective release from your\r\nsufferings is now offered to you.\r\n\r\n    THE J. B. L. CATARRH REMEDY\r\n\r\nIs one of those sterling specifics whose curative effects are quickly\r\nrealized on the first trial. It is intended to be used in connection\r\nwith the flushing treatment, and the two used in conjunction\r\n\r\n    RARELY FAIL TO EFFECT A CURE.\r\n\r\nCatarrh is first caused by inflammation of the membrane of the nasal\r\ncavities and air passages, which is followed by ulceration, when\r\nnature, in order to shelter this delicate tissue, and protect the\r\nolfactory nerves, throws a tough membrane over the ulcerated condition.\r\n\r\nFlushing the Colon lays the foundation for recovery, but the membrane\r\nmust be removed, and for that purpose the J.B.L. Catarrh Remedy IS\r\nWITHOUT AN EQUAL.\r\n\r\nIt is composed of several kinds of oils, and gently, but effectually,\r\nremoves the membrane that nature has built over the inflamed parts,\r\nwhile its emollient character soothes and allays the inflammation.\r\nThese drugs are not absorbed into the system, but act only locally.\r\n\r\n    THE MOST OBSTINATE CASE WILL READILY YIELD\r\n    TO THIS TREATMENT.\r\n\r\nThe price is One Dollar per bottle, which, in view of its marvellous\r\ncurative power, is a veritable gift, and with each bottle we furnish an\r\ninhaler specially manufactured for the purpose. Two bottles will\r\nusually effect a cure--though one has been frequently known to do so in\r\nmild cases--but in the event of any one taking six bottles without\r\nbeing cured, we will forfeit\r\n\r\n    ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS,\r\n\r\nnow deposited in the Lincoln Trust Co. of New York, if they can\r\nhonestly make oath that they have faithfully used the remedy according\r\nto the directions, and have received no benefit from it.\r\n\r\n    YOU CANNOT AFFORD\r\n\r\nto neglect this opportunity of ridding yourself of this most\r\ndistressing complaint, which, if neglected too often\r\n\r\n    LEADS TO CONSUMPTION.\r\n\r\n    _DELAYS ARE DANGEROUS._\r\n\r\nCHARLES A. TYRRELL, M.D.\r\nFORMERLY PRESIDENT OF\r\nTYRRELL'S HYGIENIC INSTITUTE,\r\n134 WEST 65TH STREET\r\nNEW YORK\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe J.B.L. Antiseptic Tonic\r\n\r\nshould always be used when introducing water into the intestines. The\r\nuse of this preparation renders the water completely sterile unless it\r\nbe notoriously impure. Such water should never be used. But the\r\nAntiseptic Tonic possesses another important property which is most\r\nvaluable in cases of Constipation, for it acts as an admirable tonic on\r\nthe muscular coat of the colon, strengthening it and restoring it to\r\nnormal. For these reasons it is invaluable. Owing to the importance of\r\nusing the tonic, I have arranged to make it as inexpensive as possible\r\nand am prepared to furnish it (to users of the Cascade only) in one\r\npound air-proof cans at the price of $1.00; by mail twenty cents extra.\r\nYou can buy this at your druggist and save mail charges.\r\n\r\nCharles A. Tyrrell, M.D.\r\n134 West 65th Street, New York City",
