This has afforded the Author an opportunity to carefully\r\nrevise the book and re-write many portions, that it may embody the\r\nlatest discoveries and improvements in medicine and surgery. In\r\nperforming this labor he has been greatly assisted by contributions and\r\nvaluable aid kindly supplied by his staff of associate specialists in\r\nmedicine and surgery who constitute the Faculty of the Invalids' Hotel\r\nand Surgical Institute.\r\n\r\nThat part of the book treating of Diseases and Their Remedies will be\r\nfound to be thoroughly reliable; the prescriptions recommended therein\r\nhaving all received the sanction and endorsement of medical gentlemen of\r\nrare professional attainments and mature experience.\r\n\r\nTHE AUTHOR.\r\n\r\nBUFFALO, N.Y., January, 1895.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.\r\n\r\nEvery family needs a COMMON SENSE MEDICAL ADVISER. The frequent\r\ninquiries from his numerous patients throughout the land, suggested to\r\nthe Author the importance and popular demand for a reliable work of this\r\nkind. Consequently, he has been induced to prepare and publish an\r\nextensive dissertation on Physiology, Hygiene, Temperaments, Diseases\r\nand Domestic Remedies. It is for the interest and welfare of _every_\r\nperson, not only to understand the means for the preservation of health,\r\nbut also to know what remedies should be employed for the alleviation of\r\nthe common ailments of life.\r\n\r\nThe frequency of accidents of all kinds, injuries sustained by\r\nmachinery, contusions, drowning, poisoning, fainting, etc., and also of\r\nsudden attacks of painful diseases, such as headache, affections of the\r\nheart and nerves, inflammation of the eye, ear and other organs, renders\r\nit necessary that non-professionals should possess sufficient knowledge\r\nto enable them to employ the proper means for speedy relief. To impart\r\nthis important information is the aim of the author.\r\n\r\nMoreover, this volume treats of Human Temperaments, not only of their\r\ninfluence upon mental characteristics and bodily susceptibilities, but\r\nalso of their vital and non-vital combinations, which transmit to the\r\noffspring either health, hardihood, and longevity, or feebleness,\r\ndisease, and death. It clearly points out those temperaments which are\r\ncompatible with each other and harmoniously blend, and also those which,\r\nwhen united in marriage, result in barrenness, or produce in the\r\noffspring imbecility, deformity, and idiocy. These matters are freely\r\ndiscussed from original investigations and clinical observations, thus\r\nrendering the work a true and scientific guide to marriage.\r\n\r\nWhile instruction is imparted for the care of the body, those diseases\r\n(alas how prevalent!) are investigated which are sure to follow as a\r\nconsequence of certain abuses, usually committed through ignorance. That\r\nthese ills do exist is evident from the fact that the Author is\r\nconsulted by multitudes of unfortunate young men and women, who are\r\ndesirous of procuring relief from the weaknesses and derangements\r\nincurred by having unwittingly violated physiological laws.\r\n\r\nAlthough some of these subjects may seem out of place in a work designed\r\nfor _every_ member of the family, yet they are presented in a style\r\nwhich cannot offend the most fastidious, and with a studied avoidance of\r\nall language that can possibly displease the chaste, or disturb the\r\ndelicate susceptibilities of persons of either sex.\r\n\r\nThis book should not be excluded from the young, for it is eminently\r\nadapted to their wants, and imparts information without which millions\r\nwill suffer untold misery. It is a _false_ modesty which debars the\r\nyouth of our land from obtaining such information.\r\n\r\nAs its title indicates, the Author aims to make this book a useful and\r\npractical Medical Adviser. He proposes to express himself in plain and\r\nsimple language, and, so far as possible, to avoid the employment of\r\ntechnical words, so that all his readers may readily comprehend the\r\nwork, and profit by its perusal. Written as it is amid the many cares\r\nattendant upon a practice embracing the treatment of thousands of cases\r\nannually, and therefore containing the fruits of a rich and varied\r\nexperience, some excuse exists for any literary imperfections which the\r\ncritical reader may observe.\r\n\r\nTHE AUTHOR.\r\n\r\nBUFFALO, N.Y., July, 1875.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY WORDS.\r\n\r\nHealth and disease are physical conditions upon which pleasure and pain,\r\nsuccess and failure, depend. Every _individual_ gain increases public\r\ngain. Upon the health of its people is based the prosperity of a nation;\r\nby it every value is increased, every joy enhanced. Life is incomplete\r\nwithout the enjoyment of healthy organs and faculties, for these give\r\nrise to the delightful sensations of existence. Health is essential to\r\nthe accomplishment of every purpose; while sickness thwarts the best\r\nintentions and loftiest aims. We are continually deciding upon those\r\nconditions which are either the source of joy and happiness or which\r\noccasion pain and disease. Prudence requires that we should meet the\r\nfoes and obviate the dangers which threaten us, by turning all our\r\nphilosophy, science, and art, into practical _common sense_.\r\n\r\nThe profession of medicine is no _sinecure_; its labors are constant,\r\nits toils unremitting, its cares unceasing. The physician is expected to\r\nmeet the grim monster, \"break the jaws of death, and pluck the spoil out\r\nof his teeth.\" _His_ ear is ever attentive to entreaty, and within his\r\nfaithful breast are concealed the disclosures of the suffering. Success\r\nmay elate him, as conquest flushes the victor. Honors are lavished upon\r\nthe brave soldiers who, in the struggle with the foe, have covered\r\nthemselves with glory, and returned victorious from the field of battle;\r\nbut how much more brilliant is the achievement of those who overwhelm\r\ndisease, that common enemy of mankind, whose victims are numbered by\r\nmillions! Is it meritorious in the physician to modestly veil his\r\ndiscoveries, regardless of their importance? If he have light, why hide\r\nit from the world? Truth should be made as universal and health-giving\r\nas sunlight. We say, give light to all who are in darkness, and a remedy\r\nto the afflicted everywhere.\r\n\r\nWe, as a people, are becoming idle, living in luxury and ease, and in\r\nthe gratification of artificial wants. Some indulge in the use of food\r\nrendered unwholesome by bad cookery, and think more of gratifying a\r\nmorbid appetite than of supplying the body with proper nourishment.\r\nOthers devote unnecessary attention to the display of dress and a\r\ngenteel figure, yielding themselves completely to the sway of fashion.\r\nSuch intemperance in diet and dress manifests itself in the general\r\nappearance of the unfortunate transgressor, and exposes his folly to the\r\nworld, with little less precision than certain vices signify their\r\npresence by a tobacco-tainted breath, beer-bloated body, rum-emblazoned\r\nnose, and kindred manifestations. They coddle themselves instead of\r\npracticing self-denial, and appear to think that the chief end of life\r\nis gratification, rather than useful endeavor.\r\n\r\nI purpose to express myself candidly and earnestly on all topics\r\nrelating to health, and appeal to the common sense of the reader for\r\njustification. Although it is my aim to simplify the work, and render it\r\na practical common-sense guide to the farmer, mechanic, mariner, and\r\nday-laborer, yet I trust that it may not prove less acceptable to the\r\nscholar, in its discussion of the problems of Life. Not only does the\r\nmethod adopted in this volume of treating of the Functions of the Brain\r\nand Nervous System present many new suggestions, in its application to\r\nhygiene, the management of disease, generation and the development and\r\nimprovement of man, but the conclusions correspond with the results of\r\nthe latest investigations of the world's most distinguished _savants_.\r\nMy object is to inculcate the facts of science rather than the theories\r\nof philosophy.\r\n\r\nUnto us are committed important health trusts, which we hold, not merely\r\nin our own behalf, but for the benefit of others. If we discharge the\r\nobligations of our trusteeship, we shall enjoy present strength,\r\nusefulness, and length of days; but if we fail in their performance,\r\nthen inefficiency, incapacity, and sickness, will follow, the sequel of\r\nwhich is pain and death. Let us, then, prove worthy of this generous\r\ncommission, that we may enjoy the sweetest of all pleasures, the\r\ndelicious fruitage of honest toil and faithful obedience.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I.\r\n\r\nPHYSIOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nBIOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this chapter we propose to consider Life in its primitive\r\nmanifestations. _Biology_ is the science of living bodies, or the\r\nscience of life. Every organ of a living body has a function to perform,\r\nand _Physiology_ treats of these functions.\r\n\r\n_Function_ means the peculiar action of some particular organ or part.\r\nThere can be no vital action without change, and no change without\r\norgans. Every living thing has a structure, and _Anatomy_ treats of the\r\nstructures of organized bodies. Several chapters of this work are\r\ndevoted to _Physiological Anatomy_, which treats of the human organism\r\nand its functions.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of life is called _generation_; its perpetuation,\r\n_reproduction_. By the former function, individual life is insured; by\r\nthe latter, it is maintained. Since nutrition sustains life, it has been\r\npertinently termed _perpetual reproduction_.\r\n\r\nLATENT LIFE is contained in a small globule, a mere atom of matter, in\r\nthe sperm-cell. This element is something which, under certain\r\nconditions, develops into a living organism. The entire realm of nature\r\nteems with these interesting phenomena, thus manifesting that admirable\r\nadjustment of internal to external relations, which claims our profound\r\nattention. We are simply humble scholars, waiting on the threshold of\r\nnature's glorious sanctuary, to receive the interpretation of her divine\r\nmysteries.\r\n\r\nSome have conjectured that chemical and physical forces account for all\r\nthe phenomena of life, and that organization is not the result of vital\r\nforces. Physical science cannot inform us what the beginning was, or how\r\nvitality is the result of chemical forces; nor can it tell us what\r\ntransmutations will occur at the end of organized existence. This\r\nmysterious life-principle eludes the grasp of the profoundest\r\nscientists, and its presence in the world will ever continue to be an\r\nastonishing and indubitable testimony of Divine Power.\r\n\r\nThe physical act of generation is accomplished by the union of two\r\ncells; and as this conjugation is known to be so generally indispensable\r\nto the organization of life, we may fairly infer that it is a universal\r\nnecessity. Investigations with the microscope have destroyed the\r\nhypothesis of \"spontaneous generation.\" These show us that even the\r\nminutest living forms are derived from a parent organization.\r\n\r\nGENERATION. So long as the vital principle remains in the sperm-cell, it\r\nlies dormant. That part of the cell which contains this principle is\r\ncalled the _spermatozoön_, which consists of a flattened body, having a\r\nlong appendage tapering to the finest point. If it be remembered that a\r\nline is the one-twelfth part of an inch in length, some idea may be\r\nformed of the extreme minuteness of the body of a human spermatozoön,\r\nwhen we state that it is from 1/800 to 1/600 part of a line, and the\r\nfiliform tail 1/50 of a line, in length. This life-atom, which can be\r\ndiscerned only with a powerful magnifying glass, is perfectly\r\ntransparent, and moves about by executing a vibratile motion with its\r\nlong appendage. Within this speck of matter are hidden the multifarious\r\nforces which, under certain favorable conditions, result in\r\norganization. Magnify this infinitesimal atom a thousand times, and no\r\ncongeries of formative powers is perceived wherewith to work out the\r\nwonders of its existence. Yet it contains the principle, which is the\r\ncontribution on the part of the male toward the generation of a new\r\nbeing.\r\n\r\nThe _ovum_ or germ-cell, is the special contribution on the part of the\r\nfemale for the production of another being. The human ovum, though\r\nlarger than the spermatozoön, is also extremely small, measuring not\r\nmore than from 1/20 to 1/10 of a line, or from 1/240 to 1/120 of an\r\ninch, in diameter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.\r\n\r\n_A_. Human Spermatozoön magnified about 3,800 diameters.\r\n_B_. Vertical and lateral views of spermatozoa of man.\r\n_C, D, E, F._ Development of spermatozoa within the vesicles of evolution.\r\n_G_.

Human spermatozoön forming in its cell.\r\n_K_. Rupture of the cell and escape of the spermatozoön.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe sperm and the germ-cells contain the primary elements of all organic\r\nstructures, and both possess the special qualities and conditions by\r\nwhich they may evolve organic beings. Every cell is composed of minute\r\ngrains, within which vital action takes place. The interior of a cell\r\nconsists of growing matter; the exterior, of matter which has assumed\r\nits form and is less active.\r\n\r\nWhen the vital principle is communicated to it, the cell undergoes a\r\nrapid transformation. While this alteration takes place within the cell,\r\ndeteriorating changes occur in the cell-wall. Although vital operations\r\nbuild up these structures, yet the animal and nervous functions are\r\ncontinually disintegrating, or wasting, them.\r\n\r\nThroughout the animal kingdom, germ-cells present the same external\r\naspect when carefully examined with the microscope. No difference can be\r\nobserved between the cells of the flowers of the oak and those of the\r\napple, but the cells of the one always produce oak trees, while those of\r\nthe other always produce apple trees. The same is true of the germs of\r\nanimals, there being not the slightest apparent difference. We are\r\nunable to perceive how one cell should give origin to a dog, while\r\nanother exactly like it becomes a man. For aught we know, the ultimate\r\natoms of these cells are identical in physical character; at least we\r\nhave no means of detecting any difference.\r\n\r\nSPECIES. The term species is generally used merely as a convenient name\r\nto designate certain assemblages of individuals having various striking\r\npoints of resemblance. Scientific writers, as a rule, no longer hold\r\nthat what are usually called _species_ are constantly unvarying and\r\nunchangeable quantities. Recent researches point to the conclusion that\r\n_all species vary more or less_, and, in some instances, that the\r\nvariation is so great that the limits of general specific distinctness\r\nare sometimes exceeded.\r\n\r\nOur space will not permit us to do more than merely indicate the two\r\ngreat fundamental ideas upon which the leading theories of the time\r\nrespecting the origin of species are based. These are usually termed the\r\ndoctrine of _Special Creation_ and the doctrine of _Evolution_.\r\nAccording to the doctrine of Special Creation, it is thought that\r\nspecies are practically immutable productions, each species having a\r\n_specific centre_ where it was originally created, and from which it\r\nspread over a certain area until its further progress was obstructed by\r\nunfavorable conditions. The advocates of the doctrine of Evolution hold,\r\non the contrary, that species are not permanent and immutable, but that\r\nthey are subject to modification, and that \"the existing forms of life\r\nare descendants by true generation of pre-existing forms.\"[1] Most\r\nnaturalists are now inclined to admit the general truth of the theory of\r\nevolution, but they differ widely respecting the mode in which it\r\noccurred.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROCESS OF GENERATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe vital _principle_, represented in the _sperm_-cell by a\r\nspermatozoön, must be imparted to a _germ_-cell in order to effect\r\nimpregnation. After touching each other, separate them immediately, and\r\nobserve the result. If, with the aid of a powerful lens, we directly\r\nexamine the spermatozoön, it will be perceived that, for a short time,\r\nit preserves its dimensions and retains all its material aspects. But it\r\ndoes not long withstand the siege of decay, and, having fulfilled its\r\ndestiny, loses its organic characteristics, and begins to shrink.\r\n\r\nIf we examine the fertilized germ, we discover unusual activity, the\r\nresult of impregnation. Organic processes succeed one another with\r\nwonderful regularity, as if wrought out by inexplicable intelligence.\r\nHere begin the functions which constitute human physiology.\r\n\r\nGeneration requires that a spermatozoön be brought into actual contact\r\nwith a germ that fecundation may follow. If a spermatic cell, or\r\nspermatozoön, together with several unimpregnated ova, no matter how\r\nnear to one another, if not actually touching, be placed on the concave\r\nsurface of a watch-crystal, and covered with another crystal, keeping\r\nthem warm, and even though the vapor of the ova envelops it, no\r\nimpregnation will occur. Place the spermatozoön in contact with an ovum,\r\nand impregnation is instantly and perfectly accomplished. Should this\r\nvitalizing power be termed nerve-force, electricity, heat, or motion? It\r\nis known that these forces may be metamorphosed; for instance, nervous\r\nforce may be converted into electricity, electricity into heat, and heat\r\ninto motion, thus illustrating their affiliation and capability of\r\ntransformation. But nothing is explained respecting the real nature of\r\nthe vital principle, if we assert its identity with any of these forces;\r\nfor who can reveal the true nature of any of these, or even of matter?\r\n\r\n\r\nALTERNATE GENERATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn several insect families, the species is not wholly represented in the\r\nadult individuals of both sexes, or in their development, but, to\r\ncomplete this series, supplementary individuals, as it were, of one or\r\nof several preceding generations, are required. The son may not resemble\r\nthe father, but the grandfather, and in some instances, the likeness\r\nre-appears only in latter generations. Agassiz states: \"Alternate\r\ngeneration was first observed among the Salpae. These are marine\r\nmollusks, without shells, belonging to the family Tunicata. They are\r\ndistinguished by the curious peculiarity of being united together in\r\nconsiderable numbers so as to form long chains, which float in the sea,\r\nthe mouth(_m_) however being free in each.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2. ]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3. ]\r\n\r\n\"Fig. 2. The individuals thus joined in floating colonies produce eggs;\r\nbut in each animal there is generally but one egg formed, which is\r\ndeveloped in the body of the parent, and from which is hatched a little\r\nmollusk.\r\n\r\n\"Fig. 3, which remains solitary, and differs in many respects from the\r\nparent. This little animal, on the other hand, does not produce eggs,\r\nbut propagates, by a kind of budding, which gives rise to chains already\r\nseen in the body of their parent(a), and these again bring forth\r\nsolitary individuals, etc.\"\r\n\r\nIt therefore follows that generation in some animals require? two\r\ndifferent bodies with intermediate ones, by means of which and their\r\ndifferent modes of reproduction, a return to the original stock is\r\neffected.\r\n\r\nUNIVERSALITY OF ANIMALCULAR LIFE.--Living organisms are universally\r\ndiffused over every part of the globe. The gentle zephyr wafts from\r\nflower to flower invisible, fructifying atoms, which quicken beauty and\r\nfragrance, giving the promise of a golden fruitage, to gladden and\r\nnourish a dependent world. Nature's own sweet cunning invests all living\r\nthings constraining into her service chemical affinities, arranging the\r\nelements and disposing them for her own benefit, in such numberless ways\r\nthat we involuntarily exclaim,\r\n\r\n    \"The course of Nature is the art of God.\"\r\n\r\nThe microscope reveals the fact that matter measuring only 1/120000 of\r\nan inch diameter may be endowed with vitality, and that countless\r\nnumbers of animalcules often inhabit a single drop of stagnant water.\r\nThese monads do not vary in form, whether in motion or at rest. The life\r\nof one, even, is an inexplicable mystery to the philosopher. Ehrenberg\r\nwrites: \"Not only in the polar regions is there an uninterrupted\r\ndevelopment of active microscopic life, where larger animals cannot\r\nexist, but we find that those minute beings collected in the Antarctic\r\nexpedition of Captain James Ross exhibit a remarkable abundance of\r\nunknown, and often most beautiful forms.\"\r\n\r\nEven the interior of animal bodies is inhabited by animalcules. They\r\nhave been found in the blood of the frog and the salmon, and in the\r\noptic fluid of fishes. Organic beings are found in the interior of the\r\nearth, into which the industry of the miner has made extensive\r\nexcavations, sunk deep shafts, and thus revealed their forms; likewise,\r\nthe smallest fossil organisms form subterranean strata many fathoms\r\ndeep. Not only do lakes and inland seas abound with life, but also, from\r\nunknown depths, in volcanic districts, arise thermal springs which\r\ncontain living insects. Were we endowed with a microscopic eye, we might\r\nsee myriads of ethereal voyagers wafted by on every breeze, as we now\r\nbehold drifting clouds of aqueous vapor. While the continents of earth\r\nfurnishes evidences of the universality of organic beings, recent\r\nobservations prove that \"animal life predominates amid the eternal night\r\nof the depths of the liquid ocean.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGIN OF LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ancients, rude in many of their ideas, referred the origin of life\r\nto divine determination. The thought was crudely expressed, but well\r\nrepresented, in the following verse:\r\n\r\n    \"Then God smites his hands together,\r\n    And strikes out a soul as a spark,\r\n    Into the organized glory of things.\r\n    From the deeps of the dark.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to a Greek myth, Prometheus formed a human image from the dust\r\nof the ground, and then, by fire stolen from heaven, animated it with a\r\nliving soul. Spontaneous generation once held its sway, and now the idea\r\nof natural evolution is popular. Some believe that the inpenetrable\r\nmystery of life is evolved from the endowments of nature, and build\r\ntheir imperfect theory on observations of her concrete forms and their\r\nmanifestations, to which all our investigations are restricted. But\r\nevery function indicates purpose, every organism evinces intelligent\r\ndesign, and _all_ proclaim a Divine Power. Something cannot come out of\r\nnothing. With reason and philosophy, _chance_ is an impossibility. We,\r\ntherefore, accept the display of wisdom in nature as indicative of the\r\ndesigns of God. Thus \"has He written His claims for our profoundest\r\nadmiration and homage all over every object that He has made.\" If you\r\nask: Is there any advantage in considering the phenomena of nature as\r\nthe result of DIVINE VOLITION? we answer, that this belief corresponds\r\nwith the universally acknowledged ideas of accountability; for, with a\r\nwise, and efficient Cause, we infer there is an intelligent creation,\r\nand the desire to communicate, guide and bless, is responded to by man,\r\nwho loves, obeys, and enjoys. Nothing is gained by attributing to nature\r\nvicegerent forces. Is it not preferable to say that she responds to\r\nintelligent, loving Omnipotence? Our finiteness is illustrated by our\r\ninitiation into organized being. Emerging from a rayless atom, too\r\ndiminutive for the sight, we gradually develop and advance to the\r\nmaturity of those _conscious powers_, the exercise of which furnishes\r\nindubitable evidence of our immortality. We are pervaded with invisible\r\ninfluences, which, like the needle of the compass trembling on its\r\npivot, point us to immortality as our ultimate goal, where in the sunny\r\nclime of Love, even in a spiritual realm of joy and happiness, we may\r\neternally reign with Him who is all in all.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nPHYSIOLOGICAL ANATOMY.\r\n\r\nTHE BONES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll living bodies are made up of tissues. There is no part, no organ,\r\nhowever soft and yielding, or hard and resisting, which has not this\r\npeculiarity of structure. The _bones_ of animals, as well as their flesh\r\nand fat, are composed of tissues, and all alike made up of cells. When\r\nviewed under a microscope, each cell is seen to consist of three\r\ndistinct parts, a _nucleolus_, or dark spot, in the center of the cell,\r\naround which lies a mass of granules, called the _nucleus;_ and this, in\r\nturn, is surrounded with a delicate, transparent membrane, termed the\r\n_envelope_. Each of the granules composing the nucleus assimilates\r\nnourishment, thereby growing into an independent cell, which possesses a\r\ntriple organization similar to that of its parent, and in like manner\r\nreproduces other cells.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.\r\nNucleated cell.\r\nFrom Goeber.\r\n1. Periphery of the\r\ncell, or cell-wall.\r\n2. Nucleus. 3. Nucleolus\r\nin the center.]\r\n\r\nA variety of tissues enters into the composition of an animal structure,\r\nyet their differences are not always distinctly marked, since the\r\ncharacteristics of some are not unlike those of others. We shall notice,\r\nhowever, only the more important of the tissues.\r\n\r\nThe _Areolar_, or _Connective Tissue_, is a complete network of delicate\r\nfibers, spread over the body, and serves to bind the various organs and\r\nparts together. The fibrous and serous tissues are modifications of the\r\nareolar.\r\n\r\nThe _Nervous Tissue_ is of two kinds: The gray, which is pulpy and\r\ngranulated, and the white fibrous tissue. The _Adipose Tissue_ is an\r\nextremely thin membrane, composed of closed cells which contain fat. It\r\nis found principally just beneath the skin, giving it a smooth, plump\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.\r\nArrangement of fibers in the\r\nAreolar Tissue. Magnified 135 diameters.]\r\n\r\nThe _Cartilaginous Tissue_ consists of nucleated cells, and, with the\r\nexception of bone, is the hardest part of the animal frame. The _Osseous\r\nTissue_, or bone, is more compact and solid than the cartilaginous, for\r\nit contains a greater quantity of lime. The _Muscular Tissue_ is\r\ncomposed of bundles of fibers, which are enclosed in a cellular\r\nmembrane.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.\r\nHuman Adipose Tissue.]\r\n\r\nVarious opinions have been entertained in regard to the formation, or\r\ngrowth, of bone. Some anatomists have supposed that all bone is formed\r\nin cartilage. But this is not true, for there is an _intra-membranous_,\r\nas well as an _intra-cartilaginous_, formation of bone, as may be seen\r\nin the development of the cranial bones, where the gradual calcification\r\ntakes place upon the inner layers of the fibrous coverings.\r\nIntra-cartilaginous deposit is found in the vicinity of the\r\nblood-vessels, within the cartilaginous canals; also, there are certain\r\npoints first observed in the shafts of long bones, called _centers of\r\nossification_. These points are no sooner formed than the cartilage\r\ncorpuscles arrange themselves in concentric zones, and, lying in contact\r\nwith one another, become very compact. As ossification proceeds, the\r\ncup-shaped cavities are converted into closed interstices of bone, with\r\nextremely thin lamellæ, or layers. These, however, soon increase in\r\ndensity, and no blood-vessels can be observed within them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.\r\nVertical section of cartilage near the surface of\r\nossification. _1_. Ordinary appearance of the temporary\r\ncartilage. _1_'. Portion of the same more\r\nhighly magnified. _2_. The cells beginning to form\r\ninto concentric zones. _2_'. Portion more magnified.\r\n_3_.

Portion of the\r\nsame more highly magnified.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.\r\nThigh-bone,\r\nsawn open\r\nlengthwise.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.\r\nLower end of the thigh-bone\r\nsawn across, showing its central\r\ncavity.]\r\n\r\nThe bony plates form the boundaries of the _Haversian_, or nutritive\r\ncanals of the bones. In the _second stage of ossification_, the\r\ncartilage corpuscles are converted into bone. Becoming flattened against\r\nthe osseous lamellæ already formed, they crowd upon one another so as to\r\nentirely obliterate the lines that distinguish them; and, simultaneously\r\nwith these changes, a calcareous deposit takes place upon their\r\ninterior. Bones grow by additions to their ends and surfaces. In the\r\nchild, their extremities are separated from the body of the bone by\r\nlayer of cartilage, and the cancellated, or cellular structure, which\r\nremains for a time in the interior, represents the early condition of\r\nthe ossifying substances.\r\n\r\nThe bones contain more earthy matter in their composition than any other\r\npart of the human body, being firm, hard, and of a lime color. They\r\ncompose the skeleton or frame work, and, when united by natural\r\nligaments, form what is known as the _natural_ skeleton; when they are\r\nwired together, they are called an _artificial_ skeleton. The number of\r\nbones in the human body is variously estimated; for those regarded as\r\nsingle by some anatomists are considered by others to consist of several\r\ndistinct pieces. There are two hundred distinct bones in the human\r\nskeleton besides the teeth. These may be divided into those of the Head,\r\nTrunk, Upper Extremities, and Lower Extremities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.\r\nThe bones of the skull separated. _1_. Frontal,\r\nonly half is seen. _2_. Parietal. _3_. Occipital, only\r\nhalf is seen. _4_. Temporal. _5_. Nasal. _6_. Malar.\r\n_7_. Superior maxillary (upper jaw). _8_. Lachrymal.\r\n_9_. Inferior maxillary (lower jaw). Between\r\n_4_ and _6_ a part of the sphenoid or wedge-shaped\r\nbone, is seen. Another bone assisting to form\r\nthe skull, but not here seen, is called the _ethmoid_\r\n(sieve-like, from being full of holes), and is situated\r\nbetween the sockets of the eyes, forming the\r\nroof of the nose.]\r\n\r\nTHE BONES OF THE HEAD are classed as follows: eight belonging to the\r\nCranium, and fourteen to the Face. The bones of the Cranium are the\r\n_occipital_, two _parietal_, two _temporal, frontal, sphenoid_, and\r\n_ethmoid_. Those composing the face are, the two _nasal_, two _superior\r\nmaxillary,_ two _lachrymal_, two _malar_ two _palate_, two _inferior\r\nturbinated, vomer_, and _inferior maxillary_. The cranial bones are\r\ncomposed of two dense plates, between which there is, in most places a\r\ncancellated or cellular tissue. The external plate is fibrous, the\r\ninternal, compact and vitreous. The skull is nearly oval in form, convex\r\nexternally, the bone being much thicker at the base than elsewhere, and\r\nit is, in every respect admirably adapted to resist any injury to which\r\nit may be exposed, thus affording ample protection to the brain\r\nsubstance which it envelops. The internal surface of the cranium\r\npresents eminences and depressions for lodging the convolutions of the\r\nbrain, and numerous furrows for the ramifications of the blood-vessels.\r\nThe bones of the cranium are united to one another by ragged edges\r\ncalled _sutures_, which are quite distinct in the child but which in old\r\nage are nearly effaced. Some authorities suppose that by this\r\narrangement the cranium is less liable to be fractured by blows; others\r\nthink that the sutures allow the growth of these bones, which takes\r\nplace by a gradual osseous enlargement at the margins. The bones of the\r\n_Face_ are joined at the lower part and in front of the cranium, and\r\nserve for the attachment of powerful muscles which assist in the process\r\nof mastication. Although the soft parts of the face cover the bony\r\nstructure, yet they do not conceal its principal features, or materially\r\nchange its proportions. The form of the head and face presents some\r\nremarkable dissimilarities in different races.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.\r\n_1_. The first bone of the sternum (breast-bone).\r\n_2_.

The\r\n_Ribs_ are thin, curved bones, being convex externally. There are twelve\r\non each side, and all are attached to the spinal column. The seven upper\r\nribs, which are united in front of the sternum, are termed _true_ ribs;\r\nthe next three, which are not attached to the sternum, but to one\r\nanother are called _false_ ribs; and the last two, which are joined only\r\nto the vertebræ, are designated as _floating_ ribs. The first rib is the\r\nshortest, and they increase in length as far as the eighth, after which\r\nthis order is reversed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.\r\n_1_.

All\r\nanimals possessing\r\nsuch a row of bones\r\nare called _vertebrates_.\r\nAbove _b_ are\r\nthe cervical (neck)\r\nvertebræ; _b_ to _c_,\r\ndorsal (back) or\r\nchest vertebræ; _c_\r\nto _d_, lumbar (loins)\r\nvertebræ; _d_ to _e_, sacrum;\r\n_e_ to _f_, coccyx.]\r\n\r\nThe _Spinal Column_ or backbone, when viewed from the front presents a\r\nperpendicular appearance, but a side view shows four distinct curves.\r\nThe bones composing it are called _vertebræ_. The body part of a\r\nvertebra is light and spongy in texture, having seven projections called\r\n_processes_, four of which are the _articular_ processes, which furnish\r\nsurfaces to join the different vertebræ of the spinal column. Two are\r\ncalled _transverse_, and the remaining one is termed the _spinous_. The\r\ntransverse and spinous processes serve for the attachment of the muscles\r\nbelonging to the back. All these processes are more compact than the\r\nbody of the vertebra, and, when naturally connected, are so arranged as\r\nto form a tube which contains the _medulla spinalis_, or spinal cord.\r\nBetween the vertebræ is a highly-elastic, cartilaginous and cushion-like\r\nsubstance, which freely admits of motion, and allows the spine to bend\r\nas occasion requires. The natural curvatures of the spinal column\r\ndiminish the shock produced by falling, running or leaping, which would\r\notherwise be more directly transmitted to the brain. The ribs at the\r\nsides, the sternum in front, and the twelve dorsal bones of the spinal\r\ncolumn behind, bound the thoracic cavity, which contains the lungs,\r\nheart, and large blood-vessels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.\r\nA representation of the pelvic bones. _e_. The\r\nlumbo-sacral joint. 2. The sacrum. _3_. Coccyx. _1,1_.\r\nThe innominata. _4,4_. Acetabula.]\r\n\r\nThe _Pelvis_ is an open bony structure, consisting of the Os Innominata,\r\none on either side, and the Sacrum and Coccyx behind. The _Sacrum_,\r\nduring childhood, consists of five bones, which in later years unite to\r\nform one bone. It is light and spongy in texture, and the upper surface\r\narticulates with the lowest vertebra, while it is united at its inferior\r\nmargin to the coccyx. The _Coccyx_ is the terminal bone of the spinal\r\ncolumn. In infancy it is cartilaginous and composed of several pieces,\r\nbut in the adult these unite and form one bone. The _Innominata_, or\r\nnameless bones, during youth, consist of three separate pieces on each\r\nside; but as age advances they coalesce and form one bone. A deep\r\nsocket, called the _acetabulum_, is found near their junction, which\r\nserves for the reception of the head of the thigh-bone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.\r\n1.

The _Scapula_, or shoulder-blade, is\r\nan irregular, thin, triangular bone, situated at the posterior part of\r\nthe shoulder, and attached to the upper and back part of the chest. The\r\n_Clavicle_, or collar-bone, is located at the upper part of the chest,\r\nbetween the sternum and scapula, and connects with both. Its form\r\nresembles that of the italic letter _f_, and it prevents the arms from\r\nsliding forward. The _Humerus_, the first bone of the arm, is long,\r\ncylindrical, and situated between the scapula and fore-arm. The _Ulna_\r\nis nearly parallel with the radius, and situated on the inner side of\r\nthe fore-arm. It is the longer and larger of the two bones, and in its\r\narticulation with the humerus, forms a perfect hinge-joint. The\r\n_Radius_, so called from its resemblance to a spoke, is on the outer\r\nside of the fore-arm, and articulates with the bones of the wrist,\r\nforming a joint. The ulna and radius also articulate with each other at\r\ntheir extremities. The _Carpus_, or wrist, consists of eight bones,\r\narranged in two rows. The _Metacarpus_, or palm of the hand, is composed\r\nof five bones situated between the carpus and fingers. The _Phalanges_,\r\nfourteen in number, are the bones of the fingers and thumb, the fingers\r\neach having three and the thumb two.\r\n\r\nTHE BONES OF THE LOWER EXTREMITIES, sixty in number, are classed as\r\nfollows: The Femur, Patella, Tibia, Fibula, Tarsus, Metatarsus, and\r\nPhalanges. The _Femur_, or thigh-bone, is the longest bone in the body.\r\nIt has a large round head, which is received into the acetabulum, thus\r\naffording a good illustration of a ball and socket joint. The _Patella,_\r\nor knee-pan, is the most complicated articulation of the body. It is of\r\na round form, connects with the tibia by means of a strong ligament, and\r\nserves to protect the front of the joint, and to increase the leverage\r\nof the muscles attached to it, by causing them to act at a greater\r\nangle. The _Tibia_, or shin bone, is enlarged at each extremity and\r\narticulates with the femur above and the astragalus, the upper bone of\r\nthe tarsus, below. The _Fibula_, the small bone of the leg, is situated\r\non the outer side of the tibia, and is firmly bound to it at each\r\nextremity. The _Tarsus_, or instep, is composed of seven bones, and\r\ncorresponds to the carpus of the upper extremities. The _Metatarsus_,\r\nthe middle of the foot, bears a dose resemblance to the metacarpus, and\r\nconsists of five bones situated between the tarsus and the phalanges.\r\nThe tarsal and the metatarsal bones are so united as to give an arched\r\nappearance to the foot, thus imparting elasticity. The _Phalanges_, the\r\ntoes, consist of fourteen bones, arranged in a manner similar to that of\r\nthe fingers.\r\n\r\nWe are not less interested in tracing the formation of bone through its\r\nseveral stages, than in considering other parts of the human system. The\r\nformation of the Haversian canals for the passage of blood-vessels to\r\nnourish the bones, the earlier construction of bony tissue by a\r\nmetamorphosis of cartilaginous substance, and also the commencement of\r\nossification at distinct points, called _centers of ossification_, are\r\nall important subjects, requiring the student's careful attention. The\r\nbones are protected by an external membranous envelope, which, from its\r\nsituation is called the _periosteum_. The bones are divided into four\r\nclasses, _long, short, flat_ and _irregular_, being thus adapted to\r\nsubserve a variety of purposes.\r\n\r\nThe Long Bones are found in the limbs, where they act as levers to\r\nsustain the body and aid in locomotion. Each_long_ bone is composed of a\r\ncylinder, known as the _shaft_, and two _extremities_. The shaft is\r\nhollow, its wails being _thickest_ in THE middle and growing thinner\r\ntoward the extremities. The _extremities_ are usually considerably\r\nenlarged, for convenience of connection with other bones, and to afford\r\na broad surface for the attachment of muscles. The clavical, humerus,\r\nradius, ulna, femur, tibia, fibula, the bones of the metacarpus,\r\nmetatarsus and the phalanges, are classed as long bones.\r\n\r\nWhere the principal object to be attained is strength, and the motion of\r\nthe skeleton is limited, the individual bones are short and compressed,\r\nas the bones of the carpus and tarsus. The structure of these bones is\r\nspongy, except at the surface, where there is a thin crust of compact\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.\r\nAnatomy of a joint, _1, 1_.\r\nBones of a joint. _2, 2_. Cartilage.\r\n_3, 3, 3, 3_. Synovial\r\nmembrane.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18.\r\nAnatomy of knee joint.\r\n_1._ Lower end of thigh-bone.\r\n_3._ Knee-pan. _2, 4_ Ligaments\r\nof the knee-pan. _5_. Upper\r\nend of the tibia, or shin-bone.\r\n_6, 12_. Cartilages.]\r\n\r\nWhen protection is required for the organs of the body, or a broad flat\r\nsurface for the attachment of the muscles, the bones are expanded into\r\nplates, as in the cranium and shoulder-blades.\r\n\r\nThe _irregular_ or _mixed_ bones are those which, from their peculiar\r\nshape, cannot be classed among any of the foregoing divisions. Their\r\nstructure is similar to the others, consisting of cancellar tissue,\r\nsurrounded by a crust of compact matter.\r\n\r\nThe vertebræ, sacrum, coccyx, temporal, sphenoid, ethmoid, malar, two\r\nmaxillary, palate, inferior turbinated, and hyoid are known as irregular\r\nbones.\r\n\r\nThe formation of the joints requires not only bones, but also\r\ncartilages, ligaments, and the synovial membrane, to complete the\r\narticulation. _Cartilage_ is a smooth, elastic substance, softer than\r\nbone, and invested with a thin membrane, called _perichondrium_. When\r\ncartilage is placed upon convex surfaces, the reverse is true. The\r\n_Ligaments_ are white, inelastic, tendinous substances, softer than\r\ncartilage, but harder than membrane. Their function is to bind together\r\nthe bones. The _Synovial Membrane_ covers the cartilages, and is then\r\nreflected upon the ligaments, thus forming a thin, closed sac, called\r\nthe _synovial capsule._\r\n\r\nAll the synovial membranes secrete a lubricating fluid, termed\r\n_synovia_, which enables the surfaces of the bones and ligaments to move\r\nfreely upon one another. When this fluid is secreted in excessive\r\nquantities, it produces a disease known as \"dropsy of the joints.\" There\r\nare numerous smaller sacs besides the synovial, called _bursæ mucosæ_,\r\nwhich in structure are analogous to them, and secrete a similar fluid.\r\nSome joints permit motion in every direction, as the shoulders, some in\r\ntwo directions only, as the elbows, while others do not admit of any\r\nmovement. The bones, ligaments, cartilages, and synovial membrane, are\r\nsupplied with nerves, arteries, and veins.\r\n\r\nWhen an animal is provided with an internal bony structure, it indicates\r\na high rank in the scale of organization. An elaborate texture of bone\r\nis found in no class below the vertebrates. Even in the lower order of\r\nthis sub-kingdom, which is the highest of animals, bone does not exist,\r\nas is the case in some tribes of fishes, such as sharks, etc., and in\r\nall classes below that of the cartilaginous fishes, the inflexible\r\nsubstance which sustains the soft parts is either shell or some\r\nmodification of bone, and is usually found on the outside of the body.\r\nTrue bone, on the contrary, is found in the interior, and, therefore, in\r\nhigher animals, the skeleton is always internal, while the soft parts\r\nare placed external to the bony frame. While many animals of the lowest\r\nspecies, being composed of soft gelatinous matter, are buoyant in water,\r\nthe highest type of animals requires not only a bony skeleton, but also\r\na flexible, muscular system, for locomotion in the water or upon the\r\nland. Each species of the animal kingdom is thus organically adapted to\r\nits condition and sphere of life.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nPHYSIOLOGICAL ANATOMY.\r\n\r\nTHE MUSCLES.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19.\r\nMuscular fillers highly\r\nmagnified.]\r\n\r\nThe _Muscles_ are those organs of the body by which motion is produced,\r\nand are commonly known as _flesh_. A muscle is composed of _fascieuli_,\r\nor bundles of fibers, parallel to one another. They are soft, varying in\r\nsize, of a reddish color, and inclosed in a cellular, membranous sheath.\r\nEach _fasciculus_ contains a number of small fibers, which, when\r\nsubjected to a microscopic examination, are found to consist of\r\n_fibrillae_, or little fibers; each of these fibrillae in turn being\r\ninvested with a delicate sheath. The fibers terminate in a glistening,\r\nwhite _tendon_, or hard cord, which is attached to the bone. So firmly\r\nare they united, that the bone will break before the tendon can be\r\nreleased. When the tendon is spread out, so as to resemble a membrane,\r\nit is called _fascia_. Being of various extent and thickness, it is\r\ndistributed over the body, as a covering and protection for the more\r\ndelicate parts, and aids also in motion, by firmly uniting the muscular\r\nfibers. The spaces between the muscles are frequently filled with fat,\r\nwhich gives roundness and beauty to the limbs. The muscles are of\r\nvarious forms; some are longitudinal, each extremity terminating in a\r\ntendon, which gives them a _fusiform_ or spindle-shaped appearance;\r\nothers are either fan-shaped, flat, or cylindrical.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20.\r\n1. A spindle-shaped muscle, with tendinous\r\nterminations. 2. Fan-shaped muscle.\r\n3. Penniform muscle. 4. Bipenniform\r\nmuscle.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21.\r\nStriped muscular fibre showing cleavage in\r\nopposite directions. 1. Longitudinal cleavage.\r\n2. Transverse cleavage. 3. Transverse section of\r\ndisc. 4. Disc nearly detached. 5. Detached disc,\r\nshowing the sarcous elements. 6. Fibrillæ. 7,8.\r\nSeparated fibrillae highly magnified.]\r\n\r\nEvery muscle has an _origin_ and an _insertion_. The term _origin_ is\r\napplied to the more fixed or central attachment of a muscle, and the\r\nterm _insertion_ to the movable point to which the force of the muscle\r\nis directed; but the origin is not absolutely fixed, except in a small\r\nnumber of muscles, as those of the face, which are attached at one\r\nextremity to the bone, and at the other to the movable integument, or\r\nskin. In most instances, the muscles may act from either extremity. The\r\nmuscles are divided into the Voluntary, or muscles of animal life, and\r\nthe Involuntary, or muscles of organic life. There are, however, some\r\nmuscles which cannot properly be classified with either, termed\r\nIntermediate. The _Voluntary Muscles_ are chiefly controlled by the\r\nwill, relaxing and contracting at its pleasure, as in the motion of the\r\neyes, mouth, and limbs. The fibers are of a dark red color, and possess\r\ngreat strength. These fibers are parallel, seldom interlacing, but\r\npresenting a striped or striated appearance; and a microscopic\r\nexamination of them shows that even the most minute consist of parallel\r\nfilaments marked by longitudinal and transverse _striae_, or minute\r\nchannels. The fibers are nearly the same length as the muscles to which\r\nthey belong. Each muscular fiber is capable of contraction; it may act\r\nsingly, though usually it acts in unison with others. By a close\r\ninspection, it has been found that fibers may be drawn apart\r\nlongitudinally, in which case they are termed _fibrillae_, or they may\r\nbe separated transversely, forming a series of discs. The _Sarcolemma_,\r\nor investing sheath of the muscles, appears to be formed even before\r\nthere are any visible traces of the muscle itself. It is a transparent\r\nand delicate membrane, but very elastic. The _Involuntary Muscles_ are\r\ninfluenced by the sympathetic nervous system, and their action pertains\r\nto the nutritive functions of the body. They differ from the voluntary\r\nmuscles in not being striated, having no tendons, and in the net-work\r\narrangements of their fibers. The _Intermediate Muscles_ are composed of\r\nstriated and unstriated fibers; they are, therefore, both voluntary and\r\ninvoluntary in their functions. The muscles employed in respiration are\r\nof this class, for we can breathe rapidly or slowly, and, for a short\r\ntime, even suspend their action; but soon, however, the organic muscles\r\nassert their instinctive control, and respiration is resumed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.\r\nUnstriated muscular fiber; at _b_, in its natural\r\nstate; at _a_, showing the nuclei after the action of\r\nacetic acid. ]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23.\r\nA view of the under side of the diaphragm.]\r\n\r\nTHE DIAPHRAGM, or midriff, is the muscular division between the thorax\r\nand the abdomen. It has been compared to an inverted basin, the\r\nconcavity of which is directed toward the abdomen. The muscles receive\r\ntheir nourishment from the numerous blood-vessels which penetrate their\r\ntissues. The voluntary muscles are abundantly supplied with nerves,\r\nwhile the involuntary are not so numerously furnished. The color of the\r\nmuscles is chiefly due to the blood which they contain. They vary in\r\nsize according to their respective functions. For example, the functions\r\nof the heart require large and powerful muscles, and those of the eye,\r\nsmall and delicate ones. There are between four hundred and sixty and\r\nfive hundred muscles in the human body.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24.\r\nA representation of the superficial layer of muscles on the anterior\r\nportion of the body.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25.\r\nA representation of the superficial layer of muscles on the posterior\r\nportion of the body.]\r\n\r\nVery rarely is motion produced by the action of a single muscle, but by\r\nthe harmonious action of several. There is infinite variety in the\r\narrangement of the muscles, each being adapted to its purpose, in\r\nstrength, tenacity, or elasticity. While some involuntarily respond to\r\nthe wants of organic life, others obey, with mechanical precision, the\r\nedicts of the will. The peculiar characteristic of the muscles is their\r\ncontractility; for example, when the tip of the finger is placed in the\r\near, an incessant vibration, due to the contraction of the muscles of\r\nthe ear, can be heard. When the muscles contract, they become shorter;\r\nbut what is lost in length is gained in breadth and thickness, so that\r\ntheir actual volume remains the same. Muscles alternately contract and\r\nrelax, and thus act upon the bones. The economy of muscular power thus\r\ndisplayed is truly remarkable. In easy and graceful walking, the forward\r\nmotion of the limbs is not altogether due to the exercise of muscular\r\npower, but partly to the force of gravity, and only a slight assistance\r\nof the muscles is required to elevate the leg sufficiently to allow it\r\nto oscillate.\r\n\r\nMotion is a characteristic of living bodies. This is true, not only in\r\nanimals, but also in plants. The oyster, although not possessing the\r\npower of locomotion, opens and closes its shell at pleasure. The coral\r\ninsect appears at the door of its cell, and retreats at will. All the\r\nvaried motions of animals are due to a peculiar property of the muscles,\r\ntermed _contractility_. Although plants are influenced by external\r\nagents, as light, heat, electricity, etc., yet it is supposed that they\r\nmay move in response to inward impulses. The sensitive stamens of the\r\nbarberry, when touched at their base on the inner side, resent the\r\nintrusion, by making a sudden jerk forward. Venus's fly-trap, a plant\r\nfound in North Carolina, is remarkable for the sensitiveness of its\r\nleaves; which close suddenly and capture insects which chance to alight\r\nupon them. The muscles of the articulates are situated within the solid\r\nframework, unlike the vertebrates, whose muscles are external to the\r\nbony skeleton. All animals have the power of motion, from the lowest\r\nradiate to the highest vertebrate, from the most repulsive polyp to that\r\ntype of organized life made in the very image of God.\r\n\r\nThe muscles, then, subserve an endless variety of purposes. By their aid\r\nthe farmer employs his implements of husbandry, the mechanic deftly\r\nwields his tools, the artist plies his brush, while the fervid orator\r\ngives utterance to thoughts glowing with heavenly emotions. It is by\r\ntheir agency that the sublimest spiritual conceptions can be brought to\r\nthe sphere of the senses, and the noblest, loftiest aims of to-day can\r\nbe made glorious realizations of the future.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nPHYSIOLOGICAL ANATOMY.\r\n\r\nTHE DIGESTIVE ORGANS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Digestion_ signifies the act of separating or distributing, hence its\r\napplication to the process by which food is made available for nutritive\r\npurposes. The organs of digestion are the Mouth, Teeth, Tongue, Salivary\r\nGlands, Pharynx, Esophagus, the Stomach and the Intestines, with their\r\nglands, the Liver, Pancreas, Lacteals, and the Thoracic Duct.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26.\r\nA view of the lower jaw. _1_. The body.\r\n_2, 2_. Rami, or branches. _3, 3_. Processes of\r\nthe lower jaw. _m_. Molar teeth. _b_. Bicuspids,\r\n_c_. Cuspids. _i_. Incisors.]\r\n\r\nThe _Mouth_ is an irregular cavity, situated between the upper and the\r\nlower jaw, and contains the organs of mastication. It is bounded by the\r\nlips in front, by the cheeks at the sides, by the roof of the mouth and\r\nteeth of the upper jaw above, and behind and beneath by the teeth of the\r\nlower jaw, soft parts, and palate. The soft palate is a sort of pendulum\r\nattached only at one of its extremities, while the other involuntarily\r\nopens and closes the passage from the mouth to the pharynx. The interior\r\nof the mouth, as well as other portions of the alimentary canal, is\r\nlined with a delicate tissue, called _mucous membrane_.\r\n\r\nThe _Teeth_ are firmly inserted in the alveoli or sockets, of the upper\r\nand the lower jaw. The first set, twenty in number, are temporary, and\r\nappear during infancy. They are replaced by permanent teeth, of which\r\nthere are sixteen in each jaw; four incisors, or front teeth, four\r\ncuspids, or eye teeth, four bicuspids, or grinders, and four molars, or\r\nlarge grinders. Each tooth is divided into the crown, body, and root.\r\nThe _crown_ is the grinding surface; the _body_, the part projecting\r\nfrom the jaw, is the seat of sensation and nutrition; the _root_ is that\r\nportion of the tooth which is inserted in the alveolus. The teeth are\r\ncomposed of dentine, or ivory, and enamel. The ivory forms the greater\r\nportion of the body and root, while the enamel covers the exposed\r\nsurface. The small white cords communicating with the teeth are the\r\nnerves.\r\n\r\nThe _Tongue_ is a flat oval organ, the base of which is attached to the\r\nos hyoides, while the apex, the most sensitive part of the body, is\r\nfree. Its surface is covered with a membrane, which, at the sides and\r\nlower part, is continuous with the lining of the mouth. On the lower\r\nsurface of the tongue, this membrane is thin and smooth, but on the\r\nupper side it is covered with numerous papillae, which, in structure,\r\nare similar to the sensitive papillae of the skin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 27.\r\nThe salivary glands. The largest one, near the ear, is the\r\nparotid gland. The next below it is the submaxillary gland.\r\nThe one under the tongue is the sublingual gland.]\r\n\r\nThe _Salivary Glands_ are six in number, three on each side of the\r\nmouth. Their function is to secrete a fluid called _saliva_, which aids\r\nin mastication. The largest of these glands, the _Parotid_, is situated\r\nin front and below the ear; its structure, like that of all the salivary\r\nglands, is cellular. The _Submaxillary_ gland is circular in form, and\r\nsituated midway between the angle of the lower jaw and the middle of the\r\nchin. The _Sublingual_ is a long flattened gland, and, as its name\r\nindicates, is located below the tongue, which when elevated, discloses\r\nthe saliva issuing from its porous openings.\r\n\r\nThe _Pharynx_ is nearly four inches in length, formed of muscular and\r\nmembranous cells, and situated between the base of the cranium and the\r\nesophagus, in front of the spinal column. It is narrow at the upper\r\npart, distended in the middle, contracting again at its junction with\r\nthe esophagus. The pharynx communicates with the nose, mouth, larynx,\r\nand esophagus.\r\n\r\nThe _Esophagus_, a cylindrical organ, is a continuation of the pharynx,\r\nand extends through the diaphragm to the stomach. It has three coats:\r\nfirst, the muscular, consisting of an exterior layer of fibers running\r\nlongitudinally, and an interior layer of transverse fibers; second, the\r\ncellular, which is interposed between the muscular and the mucous coat;\r\nthird, the mucous membrane, or internal coat, which is continuous with\r\nthe mucous lining of the pharynx.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28.\r\nA representation of the interior of the stomach.\r\n_1_. The esophagus. _2_. Cardiac orifice opening into\r\nthe stomach. _6_. The middle or muscular coat.\r\n_7_. The interior or mucous coat. _10_. The beginning\r\nof the duodenum. _11_. The pyloric orifice.]\r\n\r\nThe _Stomach_ is a musculo-membranous, conoidal sac, communicating with\r\nthe esophagus by means of the cardiac orifice (see Fig. 28). It is\r\nsituated obliquely with reference to the body, its base lying at the\r\nleft side, while the apex is directed toward the right side. The stomach\r\nis between the liver and spleen, subjacent to the diaphragm, and\r\ncommunicates with the intestinal canal by the pyloric orifice. It has\r\nthree coats. The peritoneal, or external coat is composed of compact,\r\ncellular tissue, woven into a thin, serous membrane, and assists in\r\nkeeping the stomach in place. The middle coat is formed of three layers\r\nof muscular fibers: in the first, the fibres run longitudinally; in the\r\nsecond, in a circular direction; and in the third, they are placed\r\nobliquely to the others. The interior, or mucous coat, lines this organ.\r\nThe stomach has a soft, spongy appearance, and, when not distended, lies\r\nin folds. During life, it is ordinarily of a pinkish color. It is\r\nprovided with numerous small glands, which secrete the gastric fluid\r\nnecessary for the digestion of food. The lining membrane, when divested\r\nof mucus, has a wrinkled appearance. The arteries, veins, and\r\nlymphatics, of the stomach are numerous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 29.\r\nSmall and large intestines. _1, 1, 2, 2_.\r\nSmall intestine. _3_.

Rectum.]\r\n\r\nThe _Intestines_ are those convoluted portions of the alimentary canal\r\ninto which the food is received after being partially digested, and in\r\nwhich the separation and absorption of the nutritive materials and the\r\nremoval of the residue take place. The coats of the intestines are\r\nanalogous to those of the stomach, and are, in fact, only extensions of\r\nthem. For convenience of description, the intestines may be divided into\r\nthe _small_ and the _large_. The small intestine is from twenty to\r\ntwenty-five feet in length, and consists of the Duodenum, Jejunum, and\r\nIleum. The _Duodenum_, so called because its length is equal to the\r\nbreadth of twelve fingers, is the first division of the small intestine.\r\nIf the mucous membrane of the duodenum be examined, it will be found\r\nthrown into numerous folds, which are called _valvulæ conniventes_, the\r\nchief function of which appears to be to retard the course of the\r\nalimentary matter, and afford a larger surface for the accommodation of\r\nthe absorbent vessels. Numerous _villi_, minute thread-like projections,\r\nwill be found scattered over the surface of these folds, set side by\r\nside, like the pile of velvet. Each _villus_ contains a net-work of\r\nblood-vessels, and a lacteal tube, into which the ducts from the liver\r\nand pancreas open, and pour their secretions to assist in the conversion\r\nof the chyme into chyle. The _Jejunum_, so named because it is usually\r\nfound empty after death, is a continuation of the duodenum, and is that\r\nportion of the alimentary canal in which the absorption of nutritive\r\nmatter is chiefly effected. The _Ileum_, which signifies something\r\nrolled up, is the longest division of the small intestine. Although\r\nsomewhat thinner in texture than the jejunum, yet the difference is\r\nscarcely perceptible. The large intestine is about five feet in length,\r\nand is divided into the Caecum, Colon, and Rectum. The _Caecum_ is about\r\nthree inches in length. Between the large and the small intestine is a\r\nvalve, which prevents the return of excrementitious matter that has\r\npassed into the large intestine. There is attached to the cæcum an\r\nappendage about the size of a goose-quill, and three inches in length,\r\ntermed the _appendix vermiformis_. The _Colon_ is that part of the large\r\nintestine which extends from the cæcum to the rectum, and which is\r\ndivided into three parts, distinguished as the ascending, the\r\ntransverse, and the descending.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30.\r\nVilli of the small intestine greatly\r\nmagnified.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 31.\r\nA section of the Ileum, turned inside out,\r\nso as to show the appearance and arrangement\r\nof the villi on an extended surface.]\r\n\r\nThe _Rectum_ is the terminus of the large intestine. The intestines are\r\nabundantly supplied with blood-vessels. The arteries of the small\r\nintestine are from fifteen to twenty in number. The large intestine is\r\nfurnished with three arteries, called the _colic arteries_. The\r\n_ileo-colic artery_ sends branches to the lower part of the ileum, the\r\nhead of the colon, and the appendix vermiformis. The _right colic\r\nartery_ forms arches, from which branches are distributed to the\r\nascending colon. The _colica media_ separates into two branches, one of\r\nwhich is sent to the right portion of the transverse colon, the other to\r\nthe left. In its course, the _superior hemorrhoidal artery_ divides into\r\ntwo branches, which enter the intestine from behind, and embrace it on\r\nall sides, almost to the anus.\r\n\r\nThe _Thoracic Duct_ is the principal trunk of the absorbent system, and\r\nthe canal through which much of the chyle and lymph is conveyed to the\r\nblood. It begins by a convergence and union of the lymphatics on the\r\nlumbar vertebræ, in front of the spinal column, then passes upward\r\nthrough the diaphragm to the lower part of the neck, thence curves\r\nforward and downward, opening into the subclavian vein near its junction\r\nwith the left jugular vein, which leads to the heart.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 32.\r\n_c, c_.

Mesenteric glands,\r\nthrough which the lacteals pass to the\r\nthoracic duct.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33.\r\nThe inferior surface of the liver. 1. Right lobe.\r\n2. Left lobe. 3. Gall-bladder.]\r\n\r\nThe _Liver_, which is the largest gland in the body, weighs about four\r\npounds in the adult, and is located chiefly on the right side,\r\nimmediately below the diaphragm. It is a single organ, of a dark red\r\ncolor, its upper surface being convex, while the lower is concave. It\r\nhas two large lobes, the right being nearly four times as large as the\r\nleft. The liver has two coats, the _serous_, which is a complete\r\ninvestment, with the exception of the diaphragmatic border, and the\r\ndepression for the gall-bladder, and which helps to suspend and retain\r\nthe organ in position; and the _fibrous_, which is the inner coat of the\r\nliver, and forms sheaths for the blood-vessels and excretory ducts. The\r\nliver is abundantly supplied with arteries, veins, nerves, and\r\nlymphatics. Unlike the other glands of the human body, it receives two\r\nkinds of blood; the arterial for its nourishment, and the venous, from\r\nwhich it secretes the bile. In the lower surface of the liver is lodged\r\nthe gall-bladder, a membranous sac, or reservoir, for the bile. This\r\nfluid is not absolutely necessary to the digestion of food, since this\r\nprocess is effected by other secretions, nor does bile exert any special\r\naction upon, starchy or oleaginous substances, when mixed with them at a\r\ntemperature of 100° F. Experiments also show that in some animals there\r\nis a constant flow of bile, even when no food has been taken, and there\r\nis consequently no digestion to be performed. Since the bile is formed\r\nfrom the venous blood, and taken from the waste and disintegration of\r\nanimal tissue, it would appear that it is chiefly an excrementitious\r\nfluid. It does not seem to have accomplished its function when\r\ndischarged from the liver and poured into the intestine, for there it\r\nundergoes various alterations previous to re-absorption, produced by its\r\ncontact with the intestinal juices. Thus the bile, after being\r\ntransformed in the intestines, re-enters the blood under a new form, and\r\nis carried to some other part of the system to perform its mission.\r\n\r\nThe _Spleen_ is oval, smooth, convex on its external, and irregularly\r\nconcave on its internal, surface. It is situated on the left side, in\r\ncontact with the diaphragm and stomach. It is of a dark red color,\r\nslightly tinged with blue at its edges. Some physiologists affirm that\r\nno organ receives a greater quantity of blood, according to its size,\r\nthan the spleen. The structure of the spleen and that of the mesenteric\r\nglands are similar, although the former is provided with a scanty supply\r\nof lymphatic vessels, and the chyle does not pass through it, as through\r\nthe mesenteric glands. The _Pancreas_ lies behind the stomach, and\r\nextends transversely across the spinal column to the right of the\r\nspleen. It is of a pale, pinkish color, and its secretion is analogous\r\nto that of the salivary glands; hence it has been called the _Abdominal\r\nSalivary Gland_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 34.\r\nDigestive organs. _3_.

The small and large intestines\r\nare represented below the stomach.]\r\n\r\nDigestion is effected in those cavities which we have described as parts\r\nof the alimentary canal. The food is first received into the mouth,\r\nwhere it is masticated by the teeth, and, after being mixed with mucus\r\nand saliva, is reduced to a mere pulp; it is then collected by the\r\ntongue, which, aided by the voluntary muscles of the throat, carries the\r\nfood backward into the pharynx, and, by the action of the involuntary\r\nmuscles of the pharynx and esophagus, is conveyed to the stomach. Here\r\nthe food is subjected to a peculiar, churning movement, by the alternate\r\nrelaxation and contraction of the fibers which compose the muscular wall\r\nof the stomach. As soon as the food comes in contact with the stomach,\r\nits pinkish color changes to a bright red; and from the numerous tubes\r\nupon its inner surface is discharged a colorless fluid, called the\r\n_gastric juice_, which mingles with the food and dissolves it. When the\r\nfood is reduced to a liquid condition, it accumulates in the pyloric\r\nportion of the stomach. Some distinguished physiologists believe that\r\nthe food is kept in a gentle, unceasing, but peculiar motion, called\r\n_peristaltic_, since the stomach contracts in successive circles. In the\r\nstomach the food is arranged in a methodical manner. The undigested\r\nportion is detained in the upper, or cardiac extremity, near the\r\nentrance of the esophagus, by contraction of the circular fibers of the\r\nmuscular coat. Here it is gradually dissolved, and then carried into the\r\npyloric portion of the stomach. From this, then, it appears, that the\r\ndissolved and undissolved portions of food occupy different parts of the\r\nstomach. After the food has been dissolved by the gastric fluid, it is\r\nconverted into a homogeneous, semi-fluid mass, called _chyme_. This\r\nsubstance passes from the stomach through the pyloric orifice into the\r\nduodenum, in which, by mixing with the bile and pancreatic fluid, its\r\nchemical properties are again modified, and it is then termed _chyle_,\r\nwhich has been found to be composed of three distinct parts, a\r\nreddish-brown sediment at the bottom, a whey-colored fluid in the\r\nmiddle, and a creamy film at the top. Chyle is different from chyme in\r\ntwo respects: First, the alkali of the digestive fluids, poured into the\r\nduodenum, or upper part of the small intestine, neutralizes the acid of\r\nthe chyme; secondly, both the bile and the pancreatic fluid seem to\r\nexert an influence over the fatty substances contained in the chyme,\r\nwhich assists the subdivision of these fats into minute particles. While\r\nthe chyle is propelled along the small intestine by the peristaltic\r\naction, the matter which it contains in solution is absorbed in the\r\nusual manner into the vessels of the villi by the process called\r\n_osmosis_. The fatty matters being subdivided into very minute\r\nparticles, but not dissolved, and consequently incapable of being thus\r\nabsorbed by osmosis, pass bodily through the epithelial lining of the\r\nintestine into the commencement of the lacteal tubes in the villi. The\r\ndigested substances, as they are thrust along the small intestines,\r\ngradually lose their albuminoid, fatty, and soluble starchy and\r\nsaccharine matters, and pass through the ileo-caecal valve into the\r\ncæcum and large intestine. An acid reaction takes place here, and they\r\nacquire the usual fæcal smell and color, which increases as they\r\napproach the rectum. Some physiologists have supposed that a second\r\ndigestion takes place in the upper portion of the large intestine. The\r\nlacteals, filled with chyle, pass into the mesenteric glands with which\r\nthey freely unite, and afterward enter the _receptaculum chyli_, which\r\nis the commencement of the thoracic duct, a tube of the size of a\r\ngoose-quill, which lies in front of the backbone. The lymphatics, the\r\nfunction of which is to secrete and elaborate lymph, also terminate in\r\nthe _receptaculum chyli_, or receptacle for the chyle. From this\r\nreservoir the chyle and lymph flow into the thoracic duct, through which\r\nthey are conveyed to the left subclavian vein, there to be mingled with\r\nvenous blood. The blood, chyle, and lymph, are then transmitted directly\r\nto the lungs.\r\n\r\nThe process of nutrition aids in the development and growth of the body;\r\nhence it has been aptly designated a \"perpetual reproduction.\" It is the\r\nprocess by which every part of the body assimilates portions of the\r\nblood distributed to it. In return, the tissues yield a portion of the\r\nmaterial which was once a component part of their organization. The body\r\nis constantly undergoing waste as well as repair. One of the most\r\ninteresting facts in regard to the process of nutrition in animals and\r\nplants is, that all tissues originate in cells. In the higher types of\r\nanimals, the blood is the source from which the cells derive their\r\nconstituents. Although the alimentary canal is more or less complicated\r\nin different classes of animals, yet there is no species, however low in\r\nthe scale of organization, which does not possess it in some form.[2]\r\nThe little polyp has only one digestive cavity, which is a pouch in the\r\ninterior of the body. In some animals circulation is not distinct from\r\ndigestion, in others respiration and digestion are performed by the same\r\norgans; but as we rise in the scale of animal life, digestion and\r\ncirculation are accomplished in separate cavities, and the functions of\r\nnutrition become more complex and distinct.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nPHYSIOLOGICAL ANATOMY.\r\n\r\nABSORPTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 35.\r\nVilli of the small intestine greatly magnified.]\r\n\r\n_Absorption_ is the vital function by which nutritive materials are\r\nselected and imbibed for the sustenance of the body. Absorption, like\r\nall other functional processes, employs agents to effect its purposes,\r\nand the _villi_ of the small intestine, with their numberless projecting\r\norgans, are specially employed to imbibe fluid substances; this they do\r\nwith a celerity commensurate to the importance and extent of their\r\nduties. They are little vascular prominences of the mucous membrane,\r\narising from the interior surface of the small intestine. Each villus\r\nhas two sets of vessels. (1.) The blood-vessels, which, by their\r\nfrequent blending, form a complete net-work beneath the external\r\nepithelium; they unite at the base of the villus, forming a minute vein,\r\nwhich is one of the sources of the portal vein. (2.) In the center of\r\nthe villus is another vessel, with thinner and more transparent walls,\r\nwhich is the commencement of a lacteal.\r\n\r\nThe _Lacteals_ originate in the walls of the alimentary canal, are very\r\nnumerous in the small intestine, and, passing between the laminae of the\r\nmesentery, they terminate in the _receptaculum chyli_, or reservoir for\r\nthe chyle. The mesentery consists of a double layer of cellular and\r\nadipose tissue. It incloses the blood-vessels, lacteals, and nerves of\r\nthe small intestine, together with its accessory glands. It is joined to\r\nthe posterior abdominal wall by a narrow _root_; anteriorly, it is\r\nattached to the whole length of the small intestine. The lacteals are\r\nknown as the absorbents of the intestinal walls, and after digestion is\r\naccomplished, are found to contain a white, milky fluid, called _chyle_.\r\nThe chyle does not represent the entire product of digestion, but only\r\nthe fatty substances suspended in a serous fluid.\r\n\r\nFormerly, it was supposed that the lacteals were the only agents\r\nemployed in absorption, but more recent investigations have shown that\r\nthe blood-vessels participate equally in the process, and are frequently\r\nthe more active and important of the two. Experiments upon living\r\nanimals have proved that absorption of poisonous substances occurs, even\r\nwhen all communication by way of the lacteals and lymphatics is\r\nobstructed, the passage by the blood-vessels alone remaining. The\r\nabsorbent power which the blood-vessels of the alimentary canal possess,\r\nis not limited to alimentary substances, but through them, soluble\r\nmatters of almost every description are received into the circulation.\r\n\r\nThe _Lymphatics_ are not less important organs in the process of\r\nabsorption. Nearly every part of the body is permeated by a second\r\nseries of capillaries, closely interlaced with the blood-vessels,\r\ncollectively termed the _Lymphatic System_. Their origin is not known,\r\nbut they appear to form a _plexus_ in the tissues, from which their\r\nconverging trunks arise. They are composed of minute tubes of delicate\r\nmembrane, and from their net-work arrangement they successively unite\r\nand finally terminate in two main trunks, called the _great lymphatic\r\nveins_. The lymphatics, instead of commencing on the intestinal walls,\r\nas do the lacteals, are distributed through most of the vascular tissues\r\nas well as the skin. The lymphatic circulation is not unlike that of the\r\nblood; its circulatory apparatus is, however, more delicate, and its\r\nfunctions are not so well understood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 36.\r\nA general view of the Lymphatic System.]\r\n\r\nThe _lymph_ which circulates through the lymphatic vessels is an\r\nalkaline fluid composed of a plasma and corpuscles. It may be considered\r\nas blood deprived of its red corpuscles and, diluted with water. Nothing\r\nvery definite is known respecting the functions of this fluid. A large\r\nproportion of its constituents is derived from the blood, and the exact\r\nconnection of these substances to nutrition is not properly understood.\r\nSome excrementitious matters are supposed to be taken from the tissues\r\nby the lymph and discharged into the blood, to be ultimately removed\r\nfrom the system. The lymph accordingly exerts an important function by\r\nremoving a portion of the decayed tissues from the body.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 37.\r\n1. A representation of a lymphatic\r\nvessel highly magnified. 2. Lymphatic\r\nvalves. 3. A lymphatic gland and its vessels.]\r\n\r\nIn all animals which possess a lacteal system there is also a lymphatic\r\nsystem, the one being the complement of the other. The fact that lymph\r\nand chyle are both conveyed into the general current of circulation,\r\nleads to the inference that the lymph, as well as the chyle, aids in the\r\nprocess of nutrition. The body is continually undergoing change, and\r\nvital action implies waste of tissues, as well as their growth. Those\r\norgans which are the instruments of motion, as the muscles, cannot be\r\nemployed without wear and waste of their component parts. Renovated\r\ntissues must replace those which are worn out, and it is a part of the\r\nfunction of the absorbents to convey nutritive material into the general\r\ncirculation. Researches in microscopical anatomy have shown that the\r\nskin contains multitudes of lymphatic vessels and that it is a powerful\r\nabsorbent.\r\n\r\nAbsorption is one of the earliest and most essential functions of animal\r\nand vegetables tissues. The simpler plants consist of only a few cells,\r\nall of which are employed in absorption; but in the flowering plants\r\nthis function is performed by the roots. It is accomplished on the same\r\ngeneral principles in animals, yet it presents more modifications and a\r\ngreater number of organs than in vegetables. While animals receive their\r\nfood into a sac, or bag called the _stomach_, and are provided with\r\nabsorbent vessels such as nowhere exist in vegetables, plants plunge\r\ntheir absorbent organs into the earth, whence they derive nourishing\r\nsubstances. In the lower order of animals, as in sponges, this function\r\nis performed by contiguous cells, in a manner almost as elementary as in\r\nplants. In none of the invertebrate animals is there any _special_\r\nabsorbent system. Internal absorption is classified by some authors as\r\nfollows: _interstitial_, _recrementitial_, and _excrementitial_; by\r\nothers as _accidental_, _venous_, and _cutaneous_. The general cutaneous\r\nand mucous surfaces exhale, as well as absorb; thus the skin, by means\r\nof its sudoriferous glands, exhales moisture, and is at the same time as\r\nbefore stated, a powerful absorbent. The mucous surface of the lungs is\r\ncontinually throwing off carbonic acid and absorbing oxygen; and through\r\ntheir surface poisons are sometimes taken into the blood. The continual\r\nwear and waste to which living tissues are subject, makes necessary the\r\nprovision of such a system of vessels for conveying away the worn-out\r\nmaterials and supplying the body with new.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL AND VITAL PROPERTIES OF THE BLOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 38.\r\nRed corpuscles of human blood, represented\r\nat _a_, as they are seen when\r\nrather _beyond_ the focus of the microscope;\r\nand at _b_ as they appear when,\r\n_within_ the focus.

A\r\nred corpuscle fully developed.]\r\n\r\n_Blood_ is the animal fluid by which the tissues of the body are\r\nnourished. This pre-eminently vital fluid permeates every organ,\r\ndistributes nutritive material to every texture, is essentially modified\r\nby respiration, and, finally, is the source of every secretion and\r\nexcretion. Blood has four constituents: Fibrin, Albumen, Salts (which\r\nelements, in solution, form the _liquor sanguinis_), and the Corpuscles.\r\nMicroscopical examination shows that the corpuscles are of two kinds,\r\nknown as the _red_ and the _white_, the former being by far the more\r\nabundant. They are circular in form and have a smooth exterior, and are\r\non an average 1/3200 part of an inch in diameter, and are about\r\none-fourth of that in thickness. Hence more than ten millions of them\r\nmay lie on a space an inch square. If spread out in thin layers and\r\nsubjected to transmitted light, they present a slightly yellowish color,\r\nbut when crowded together and viewed by refracted light, exhibit a deep\r\nred color. These blood-corpuscles have been termed _discs_, and are not,\r\nas some have supposed, solid material, but are very nearly fluid. The\r\nred corpuscles although subjected to continual movement, have a tendency\r\nto approach one another, and when their flattened surfaces come in\r\ncontact, so firmly do they adhere that they change their shape rather\r\nthan submit to a separation. If separated, however, they return to their\r\nusual form. The colorless corpuscles are larger than the red and differ\r\nfrom them in being extremely irregular in their shape, and in their\r\ntendency to adhere to a smooth surface, while the red corpuscles float\r\nabout and tumble over one another. They are chiefly remarkable for their\r\ncontinual variation in form. The shape of the red corpuscles is only\r\naltered by external influences, but the white are constantly undergoing\r\nalterations, the result of changes taking place within their own\r\nsubstance. When diluted with water and placed under the microscope they\r\nare found to consist of a spheroidal sac, containing a clear or granular\r\nfluid and a spheroidal vesicle, which is termed the _nucleus_. They have\r\nbeen regarded by some physiologists as identical with those of the lymph\r\nand chyle. Dr. Carpenter believes that the function of these cells is to\r\nconvert albumen into fibrin, by the simple process of cell-growth. It is\r\ngenerally believed that the red corpuscles are derived in some way from\r\nthe colorless. It is supposed that the red corpuscle is merely the\r\nnucleus of a colorless corpuscle enlarged, flattened, colored and\r\nliberated by the bursting of the wall of its cell. When blood is taken\r\nfrom an artery and allowed to remain at rest, it separates into two\r\nparts: a solid mass, called the clot, largely composed of fibrin; and a\r\nfluid known as the _serum_, in which the clot is suspended. This process\r\nis termed _coagulation_. The serum, mostly composed of _albumen_, is a\r\ntransparent, straw-colored fluid, having the odor and taste of blood.\r\nThe whole quantity of blood in the body is estimated on an average to be\r\nabout one-ninth of its entire weight. The distinctions between the\r\narterial and the venous blood are marked, since in the arterial system\r\nthe blood is uniformly bright red, and in the venous of a very dark red\r\ncolor The blood-corpuscles contain both oxygen and carbonic acid in\r\nsolution. When carbonic acid predominates, the blood is dark red; when\r\noxygen, scarlet. In the lungs, the corpuscles give up carbonic acid, and\r\nabsorb a fresh supply of oxygen, while in the general circulation the\r\noxygen disappears in the process of tissue transformation, and is\r\nreplaced, in the venous blood, by carbonic acid. The nutritive portions\r\nof food are converted into a homogeneous fluid, which pervades every\r\npart of the body, is the basis of every tissue, and which is termed the\r\n_blood_. This varies in color and composition in different animals. In\r\nthe polyp the nutritive fluid is known as _chyme_, in many mollusks, as\r\nwell as articulates, it is called _chyle_, but in vertebrates, it is\r\nmore highly organized and is called blood. In all the higher animal\r\ntypes it is of a red color, although redness is not one of its essential\r\nqualities. Some tribes of animals possess true blood, which is not red;\r\nthus the blood of the insect is colorless and transparent; that of the\r\nreptile yellowish; in the fish the principle part is without color, but\r\nthe blood of the bird is deep red. The blood of the mammalia is of a\r\nbright scarlet hue. The temperature of the blood varies in different\r\nspecies, as well as in animals of the same species under different\r\nphysiological conditions; for this reason, some animals are called\r\n_cold-blooded._ Disease also modifies the temperature of the blood; thus\r\nin fevers it is generally increased, but in cholera greatly diminished.\r\nTHE blood has been aptly termed the \"vital fluid,\" since there is a\r\nconstant flow from the heart to the tissues and organs of the body, and\r\na continual return after it has circulated through these parts. Its\r\npresence in every part of the body is one of the essential conditions of\r\nanimal life, and is effected by a special set of organs, called the\r\n_circulatory organs_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nPHYSIOLOGICAL ANATOMY.\r\n\r\nCIRCULATORY ORGANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving considered the formation of chyle, traced it through the\r\ndigestive process, seen its transmission into the _vena cava_, and,\r\nfinally, its conversion into blood, we shall now describe how it is\r\ndistributed to every part of the system. This is accomplished   through\r\norgans which, from the round of duties they perform, are called\r\n_circulatory_. These are the Heart, Arteries, Veins, and Capillaries,\r\nwhich constitute the _vascular system_.\r\n\r\nWithin the thorax or chest of the human body, and enclosed within a\r\nmembranous sac, called the _pericardium_, is the great force-pump of the\r\nsystem, the heart. This organ, to which all the arteries and veins of\r\nthe body may be either directly or indirectly traced, is roughly\r\nestimated to be equal in size to the closed fist of the individual to\r\nwhom it belongs.\r\n\r\nIt has a broad end turned upwards, and a little to the right side,\r\ntermed its _base_; and a pointed end called its _apex_, turned\r\ndownwards, forwards, and to the left side, and lying beneath a point\r\nabout an inch to the right of, and below, the left nipple, or just below\r\nthe fifth rib. Attached to the rest of the body only by the great\r\nblood-vessels which issue from and enter it at its base, the heart is\r\nthe most mobile organ in the economy, being free to move in different\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nThe heart is divided into two great cavities by a fixed partition, which\r\nextends from the base to the apex of the organ, and which prevents any\r\ndirect communication between them. Each of these great cavities is\r\nfurther subdivided transversely by a movable partition, the cavity above\r\neach transverse partition being called the _auricle_, and the cavity\r\nbelow, the _ventricle_, right or left, as the case may be.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 40.\r\nGeneral view of the heart and lungs, _t_. Trachea, or\r\nwindpipe, _a_. Aorta, _p_. Pulmonary artery, 1, 2.\r\nBranches of the pulmonary artery, one going to the\r\nright, the other to the left lung. _h._ The heart.]\r\n\r\nThe walls of the auricles are much thinner than those of the ventricles,\r\nand the wall of the right ventricle is much thinner than that of the\r\nleft, from the fact that the ventricles have more work to perform than\r\nthe auricles, and the left ventricle more than the right.\r\n\r\nIn structure, the heart is composed almost entirely of muscular fibers,\r\nwhich are arranged in a very complex and wonderful manner. The outer\r\nsurface of the heart is covered with the pericardium, which closely\r\nadheres to the muscular substance. Inside, the cavities are lined with a\r\nthin membrane, called the _endocardium_. At the junction between the\r\nauricles and ventricles, the apertures of communication between their\r\ncavities are strengthened by _fibrous rings_. Attached to these fibrous\r\nrings are the movable partitions or valves, between the auricles and the\r\nventricles, the one on the right side of the heart being called the\r\n_tricuspid valve_, and the one on the left side the _mitral valve._ A\r\nnumber of fine, but strong, tendinous chords, called _chordæ\r\ntendineæ_, connect the edges and apices of these valves with\r\ncolumn-like elevations of the fleshy substance of the walls of the\r\nventricles, called _columnæ carneæ_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 41.\r\n1.

The\r\nsemilunar valves of the aorta.]\r\n\r\nThe valves are so arranged that they present no obstacle to the free\r\nflow of blood from the auricles into the ventricles, but if any is\r\nforced the other way, it gets between the valve and the wall of the\r\nheart, and drives the valve backwards and upwards, thus forming a\r\ntransverse partition between the auricle and ventricle, through which no\r\nfluid can pass.\r\n\r\nAt the base of the heart are given off two large arteries, one on the\r\nright side, which conveys the blood to the lungs, called the _pulmonary\r\nartery_, and one on the left side, which conveys the blood to the system\r\nin general, called the _aorta_. At the junction of each of these great\r\nvessels with its corresponding ventricle, is another valvular apparatus,\r\nconsisting of three pouch-like valves, called the _semilunar valves_,\r\nfrom their resemblance, in shape, to a half-moon. Being placed on a\r\nlevel and meeting in the middle line, they entirely prevent the passage\r\nof any fluid which may be forced along the artery towards the heart,\r\nbut, flapping back, they offer no obstruction to the free flow of blood\r\nfrom the ventricles into the arteries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 42.\r\nA representation of the venous and arterial\r\ncirculation of the blood.]\r\n\r\nThe _Arteries_, being always found empty after death, were supposed by\r\nthe ancients, who were ignorant of the circulation of the blood, to be\r\ntubes containing air; hence their name, which is derived from a Greek\r\nword and signifies an _air-tube._ Arteries are the cylindrical tubes\r\nwhich carry blood to every part of the system. All the arteries, except\r\nthe coronary which supply the substance of the heart, arise from the two\r\nmain trunks, the pulmonary artery and the aorta. They are of a\r\nyellowish-white color, and their inner surface is smooth. The arteries\r\nhave three coats. (1.) The external coat, which is destitute of fat, and\r\ncomposed chiefly of cellular tissue, is very firm and elastic, and can\r\nreadily be dissected from the middle coat. (2.) The middle, or fibrous\r\ncoat, is thicker than the external, and composed of yellowish fibers,\r\nits chief property is contractility. (3.) The internal coat consists of\r\na colorless, thin, transparent membrane, yet so strong that it can, it\r\nis thought, better resist a powerful pressure than either of the others.\r\nArteries are very elastic as well as extensible, and their chief\r\nextensibility is in length. If an artery of a dead body be divided,\r\nalthough empty, its cylindrical form will be preserved.\r\n\r\nThe _Veins_ are the vessels through which the venous blood returns to\r\nthe auricles of the heart. They are more numerous than the arteries, and\r\noriginate from numerous capillary tubes, while the arteries are given\r\noff from main trunks. In some parts of the body, the veins correspond in\r\nnumber to the arteries; while in others, there are two veins to every\r\nartery. The veins commence by minute roots in the capillaries, which are\r\neverywhere distributed through the body, and gradually increase in size,\r\nuntil they unite and become large trunks, conveying the dark blood to\r\nthe heart. The veins, like the arteries, have three coats. The external,\r\nor cellular coat, resembles that of the arteries; the middle is fibrous,\r\nbut thinner than the corresponding one of the arteries; and the internal\r\ncoat is serous, and analogous to that of those vessels. The veins belong\r\nto the three following classes: (1.) The systemic veins, which bring the\r\nblood from different parts of the body and discharge it into the vena\r\ncava, by means of which it is conveyed to the heart; (2), the pulmonary\r\nveins, which bring the arterial, or bright red blood from the lungs and\r\ncarry it to the left auricle; (3), the veins of the portal system, which\r\noriginate in the capillaries of the abdominal organs, then converge into\r\ntrunks and enter the liver, to branch off again into divisions and\r\nsubdivisions of the minutest character.\r\n\r\nThe _Capillaries_ form an extremely fine net-work, and are distributed\r\nto every part of the body. They vary in diameter from 1/3500 to 1/2000\r\nof an inch. They are so universally prevalent throughout the skin, that\r\nthe puncture of a needle would wound a large number of them. These\r\nvessels receive the blood and bring it into intimate contact with the\r\ntissues, which take from it the principal part of its oxygen and other\r\nelements, and give up to it carbonic acid and the other waste products\r\nresulting from the transformation of the tissues, which are transmitted\r\nthrough the veins to the heart, and thence by the arteries to the lungs\r\nand various excretory organs.\r\n\r\nThe blood from the system in general, except the lungs, is poured into\r\nthe right auricle by two large veins, called the superior and the\r\ninferior _vena cava_,' and that returning from the lungs is poured into\r\nthe left auricle by the _pulmonary veins._\r\n\r\nDuring life the heart contracts rhythmically, the contractions\r\ncommencing at the base, in each auricle, and extending towards the apex.\r\n\r\nNow it follows, from the anatomical arrangement of this organ, that when\r\nthe auricles contract, the blood contained in them is forced through the\r\nauriculo-ventricular openings into the ventricles; the contractions then\r\nextending to the ventricles, in a wave-like manner, the great proportion\r\nof the blood, being prevented from re-entering the auricles by the\r\ntricuspid and mitral valves, is forced onward into the pulmonary artery\r\nfrom the right ventricle, and into the aorta from the left ventricle.\r\n\r\nWhen the contents of the ventricles are suddenly forced into these great\r\nblood-vessels, a shock is given to the entire mass of fluid which they\r\ncontain, and this shock is speedily propagated along their branches,\r\nbeing known at the wrist as the _pulse_.\r\n\r\nOn inspection, between the fifth and sixth ribs on the left side of the\r\nchest, a movement is perceptible, and, if the hand be applied, the\r\nimpulse may be felt. This is known as the throbbing, or beating of the\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nIf the ear is placed over the region of the heart, certain sounds are\r\nheard, which recur with great regularity. First is heard a comparatively\r\nlong, dull sound, then a short, sharp sound, then a pause, and then the\r\nlong, dull sound again. The first sound is caused mainly by the\r\ntricuspid and mitral valves, and the second is the result of sudden\r\nclosure of the semilunar valves.\r\n\r\nNo language can adequately describe the beauty of the circulatory\r\nsystem. The constant vital flow through the larger vessels, and the\r\nincessant activity of those so minute that they are almost\r\nimperceptible, fully illustrate the perfectness of the mechanism of the\r\nhuman body, and the wisdom and goodness of Him who is its author.\r\n\r\nExperiments have shown that the small arteries may be directly\r\ninfluenced through the nervous system, which regulates their caliber by\r\ncontrolling the state of contraction of their muscular walls. The effect\r\nof this influence of the nervous system enables it to control the\r\ncirculation over certain areas; and, notwithstanding the force of the\r\nheart and the state of the blood-vessels in general, to materially\r\nmodify the circulation in different spots. Blushing, which is simply a\r\nlocal modification of the circulation, is effected in this way. Some\r\nemotion takes possession of the mind, and the action of the nerves,\r\nwhich ordinarily keep up a moderate contraction of the muscular coats of\r\nthe arteries, is lost, and the vessels relax and become distended with\r\narterial blood, which is a warm and bright red fluid; thereupon a\r\nburning sensation is felt, and the skin grows red, the degree of the\r\nblush depending upon the intensity of the emotion.\r\n\r\nThe pallor produced by fright and by extreme anxiety, is purely the\r\nresult of a local modification of the circulation, brought about by an\r\nover-stimulation of the nerves which supply the small arteries, causing\r\nthem to contract, and to thus cut off more or less completely the supply\r\nof blood.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nPHYSIOLOGICAL ANATOMY.\r\n\r\nTHE ORGANS OF RESPIRATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ORGANS OF RESPIRATION are the Trachea, or windpipe, the Bronchia,\r\nformed by the subdivision of the trachea, and the Lungs, with their\r\nair-cells. The _Trachea_ is a vertical tube situated between the lungs\r\nbelow, and a short quadrangular cavity above, called the _larynx_, which\r\nis part of the windpipe, and used for the purpose of modulating the\r\nvoice in speaking or singing. In the adult, the trachea, in its\r\nunextended state, is from four and one-half to five inches in length,\r\nabout one inch in diameter, and, like the larynx, is more fully\r\ndeveloped in the male than in the female. It is a fibro-cartilaginous\r\nstructure, and is composed of flattened rings, or segments of circles.\r\nIt permits the free passage of air to and from the lungs.\r\n\r\nThe _Bronchia_ are two tubes, or branches, one proceeding from the\r\nwindpipe to each lung. Upon entering the lungs, they divide and\r\nsubdivide until, finally, they terminate in small cells, called the\r\n_bronchial or air-cells,_ which are of a membranous character.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 43.\r\nAn ideal representation of the respiratory organs. _3._ The\r\nlarynx. _4._ The trachea. _5, 6._ The bronchia. _9, 9, 9, 9._ Air-cells.\r\n_1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2._ Outlines of the lungs.]\r\n\r\nThe _Lungs_ are irregular conical organs rounded at the apex, situated\r\nwithin the chest, and filling the greater part of it, since the heart is\r\nthe only other organ which occupies much space in the thoracic cavity.\r\nThe lungs are convex externally, and conform to the cavity of the chest,\r\nwhile the internal surface is concave for the accommodation of the\r\nheart. The size of the lungs depends upon the capacity of the chest.\r\nTheir color varies, being of a pinkish hue in childhood but of a gray,\r\nmottled appearance in the adult. They are termed the _right_ and _left_\r\nlung. Each lung resembles a cone with its base resting upon the\r\ndiaphragm, and its apex behind the collar-bone. The right lung is larger\r\nthough shorter, than the left, not extending so low, and has three\r\n_lobes_, formed by deep fissures, or longitudinal divisions, while the\r\nleft has but two lobes. Each lobe is also made up of numerous _lobules_,\r\nor small lobes, connected by cellular tissue, and these contain great\r\nnumbers of cells. The lungs are abundantly supplied with blood-vessels,\r\nlymphatics, and nerves. The density of a lung depends upon the amount of\r\nair which it contains. Thus, experiment has shown that in a _foetus_\r\nwhich has never breathed, the lungs are compact and will sink in water;\r\nbut as soon as they become inflated with air, they spread over a larger\r\nsurface, and are therefore more buoyant. Each lung is invested, as far\r\nas its root, with a membrane, called the _pleura_, which is then\r\ncontinuously extended to the cavity of the chest, thus performing the\r\ndouble office of lining it, and constituting a partition between the\r\nlungs. The part of the membrane which forms this partition is termed the\r\n_mediastinum_. Inflammation of this membrane is called _pleurisy_. The\r\nlungs are held in position by the root, which is formed by the pulmonary\r\narteries, veins, nerves, and the bronchial tubes. Respiration is the\r\nfunction by which the venous blood, conveyed to the lungs by the\r\npulmonary artery, is converted into arterial blood. This is effected by\r\nthe elimination of carbonic acid, which is expired or exhaled from the\r\nlungs, and by the absorption of oxygen from the air which is taken into\r\nthe lungs, by the act of inspiration or inhalation. The act of\r\nexpiration is performed chiefly by the elevation of the diaphragm and\r\nthe descent of the ribs, and inspiration is principally effected by the\r\ndescent of the diaphragm and the elevation of the ribs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 44.\r\nA representation of the heart and lungs. 4.

Inferior vena cava.]\r\n\r\nWhen the muscles of some portions of the air-passages are relaxed, a\r\npeculiar vibration follows, known as snoring. Coughing and sneezing are\r\nsudden and spasmodic expiratory efforts, and generally involuntary.\r\nSighing is a prolonged deep inspiration, followed by a rapid, and\r\ngenerally audible expiration. It is remarkable that laughing and\r\nsobbing, although indicating opposite states of the mind, are produced\r\nin very nearly the same manner. In hiccough, the contraction is more\r\nsudden and spasmodic than in laughing or sobbing. The quantity of oxygen\r\nconsumed during sleep is estimated to be considerably less than that\r\nconsumed during wakefulness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 45.\r\nView of the pulmonary circulation.]\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to estimate the amount of air taken into the lungs at\r\neach inspiration, as the quantity varies according to the condition,\r\nsize, and expansibility of the chest, but in ordinary breathing it is\r\nsupposed to be from twenty to thirty cubic inches. The consumption of\r\noxygen is greater when the temperature is low, and during digestion. All\r\nthe respiratory movements, so far as they are independent of the will of\r\nthe individual, are controlled by that part of the brain called the\r\n_medulla oblongata_. The respiratory, or breathing process, is not\r\ninstituted for the benefit of man alone, for we find it both in the\r\nlower order of animals and in plant life. Nature is very economical in\r\nthe arrangement of her plans, since the carbonic acid, which is useless\r\nto man, is indispensable to the existence of plants, and the oxygen,\r\nrejected by them, is appropriated to his use. In the lower order of\r\nanimals, the respiratory act is similar to that of the higher types,\r\nthough not so complex; for there are no organs of respiration, as the\r\nlungs and gills are called. Thus, the higher the animal type, the more\r\ncomplex its organism. The effect of air upon the color of the blood is\r\nvery noticeable. If a quantity be drawn from the body, thus being\r\nbrought into contact with the air, its color gradually changes to a\r\nbrighter hue. There is a marked difference between the properties of the\r\nvenous and the arterial blood.\r\n\r\nThe venous blood is carried, as we have previously described, to the\r\nright side of the heart and to the lungs, where it is converted into\r\narterial blood. It is now of uniform quality, ready to be distributed\r\nthroughout the body, and capable of sustaining life and nourishing the\r\ntissues. Man breathes by means of lungs; but who can understand their\r\nwonderful mechanism, so perfect in all its parts? Though every organ is\r\nsubservient to another, yet each has its own office to perform. The\r\nminute air-cells are for the aeration of the blood; the larger bronchial\r\ntubes ramify the lungs, and suffuse them with air; the trachea serves as\r\na passage for the air to and from the lungs, while at its upper\r\nextremity is the larynx, which has been fitly called the organ of the\r\nhuman voice. At its extremity we find a sort of shield, called the\r\n_epiglottis_, the office of which is supposed to be to prevent the\r\nintrusion of foreign bodies.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nPHYSIOLOGICAL ANATOMY\r\n\r\nTHE SKIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough digestion and respiration, the blood is continually supplied\r\nwith material for its renewal; and, while the nutritive constituents of\r\nthe food are retained to promote the growth of the body, those which are\r\nuseless or injurious are in various ways expelled. There are, perhaps,\r\nfew parts of the body more actively concerned in this removal than the\r\nskin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 46: An ideal\r\nview of the papillae. 1, 1. Cutis vera.\r\n2.2. Papillary layer. 3, 3. Arteries of the papillae.\r\n4, 4. Nerves of the papillae. 5, 5. Veins of the papillae.]\r\n\r\nThe skin is a membranous envelope covering the entire body. It consists\r\nof two layers, termed the Cutis Vera, or true skin, and the Epidermis,\r\nor cuticle. The _Cutis Vera_ is composed of fibers similar to those of\r\nthe cellular tissue. It consists of white and yellow fibers, which are\r\nmore densely woven near the surface than deeper in the structure; the\r\nwhite give strength, the yellow strength and elasticity combined. The\r\ntrue skin may be divided into two layers, differing in their\r\ncharacteristics, and termed respectively the superficial or papillary\r\nlayer, and the deep or fibrous layer. Upon the external surface, are\r\nlittle conical prominences, known as _papillae_. The papillae are\r\nirregularly distributed over the body, in some parts being smaller and\r\nmore numerous than in others, as on the finger-ends, where their summits\r\nare so intimately connected as to form a tolerably smooth surface. It is\r\nowing to their perfect development, that the finger-tips are adapted to\r\nreceive the most delicate impressions of touch. Although every part of\r\nthe skin is sensitive, yet the papillae are extremely so, for they are\r\nthe principal means through which the impressions of objects are\r\ncommunicated. Each papilla not only contains a minute vein and artery,\r\nbut it also incloses a loop of sensitive nerves. When the body is\r\nexposed to cold, these papillae can be more distinctly seen in the form\r\nof prominences, commonly known as \"goose-pimples.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 47.\r\nA section of the skin, showing its arteries and\r\nveins. A, A. Arterial branches. B, B. Capillaries\r\nin which the branches terminate. C. The venous\r\ntrunk into which the blood from the capillaries\r\nflows.]\r\n\r\nThe internal, or fibrous layer of the skin, contains numerous\r\ndepressions, each of which furnishes a receptacle for fat. While the\r\nskin is supplied with a complete net-work of arteries, veins, and\r\nnerves, which make it sensitive to the slightest touch, it also contains\r\nnumerous lymphatic vessels, so minute that they are invisible to the\r\nnaked eye.\r\n\r\nAmong the agents adapted for expelling the excretions from the system,\r\nfew surpass the _Sudoriferous Glands_. These are minute organs which\r\nwind in and out over the whole extent of the true skin, and secrete the\r\nperspiration. Though much of it passes off as insensible transpiration,\r\nyet it often accumulates in drops of sweat, during long-continued\r\nexercise or exposure to a high temperature. The office of the\r\nperspiration is two-fold. It removes noxious matter from the system, and\r\ndiminishes animal heat, and thereby equalizes the temperature of the\r\nbody. It also renders the skin soft and pliable, thus better adapting it\r\nto the movements of the muscles. The _Sebaceous Glands_, which are\r\nplaced in the true skin, are less abundant where the sudoriferous glands\r\nare most numerous, and _vice versa_. Here, as elsewhere, nature acts\r\nwith systematic and intelligent design. The perspiratory glands are\r\ndistributed where they are most needed,--in the eyelids, serving as\r\nlubricators; in the ear passages, to produce the _cerumen_, or wax,\r\nwhich prevents the intrusion of small insects; and in the scalp, to\r\nsupply the hair with its natural pomatum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 48.\r\nA perspiratory gland, highly\r\nmagnified. 1, 1. The gland. 2, 2.\r\nExcretory ducts uniting to form\r\na tube which tortuously perforates\r\nthe cuticle at 3, and opens\r\nobliquely on its surface at 4.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 49.\r\nA representation of oil-tubes from the scalp\r\nand nose.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 50.\r\nAnatomy of the skin. 5, 5.

Epidermis (cuticle).]\r\n\r\nThe _Epidermis_, or _Cuticle_, so called because it is _placed upon the\r\nskin,_ is the outer layer of the skin. Since it is entirely destitute of\r\nnerves and blood-vessels, it is not sensitive. Like the cutis vera, it\r\nhas two surfaces composed of layers. The internal, or _Rete Mucosum,_\r\nwhich is made up chiefly of pigment cells, is adapted to the\r\nirregularities of the cutis vera, and sends prolongations into all its\r\nglandular follicles. The external surface, or epidermis proper, is\r\nelastic, destitute of coloring matter, and consists of mere horny\r\nscales. As soon as dry, they are removed in the form of scurf, and\r\nreplaced by new ones from the cutis vera. These scales may be removed by\r\na wet-sheet pack, or by friction. The cuticle is constantly undergoing\r\nrenewal. This layer serves to cover and protect the nervous tissue of\r\nthe true skin beneath. We may here observe that the cuticle contains the\r\npigment for coloring the skin. In dark races, as the negro, the cuticle\r\nis very thick and filled with black pigment. The radiation of animal\r\nheat is dependent upon the thickness and color of this cuticle. Thus, in\r\nthe dark races, the pigment cells are most numerous, and in proportion\r\nas the skin is dark or fair do we find these cells in greater or lesser\r\nabundance. The skin of the Albino is of pearly whiteness, devoid even of\r\nthe pink or brown tint which that of the European always possesses. This\r\npeculiarity must be attributed to the absence of pigment cells which,\r\nwhen present, always present a more or less dark color. The theory that\r\n_climate_ alone is capable of producing all these diversities is simply\r\nabsurd. The Esquimaux, who live in Greenland and the arctic regions of\r\nAmerica, are remarkable for the darkness of their complexion. Humboldt\r\nremarks that the American tribes of the tropical regions have no darker\r\nskin than the mountaineers of the temperate zone. Climate may _modify_\r\nthe complexion, but it cannot _make_ it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 51.\r\nStructure of the human hair. _A_.

Magnified 310 diameters.]\r\n\r\n_Hairs_ are horny appendages of the skin, and, with the exception of the\r\nhands, the soles of the feet, the backs of the fingers and toes, between\r\nthe last joint and the nail, and the upper eyelids, are distributed more\r\nor less abundantly over every part of the surface of the body. Over the\r\ngreater part of the surface the hairs are very minute, and in some\r\nplaces are not actually apparent above the level of the skin; but the\r\nhair of the head, when permitted to reach its full growth, attains a\r\nlength of from twenty inches to a yard, and, in rare instances, even six\r\nfeet. A hair may be divided into a middle portion, or _shaft_, and two\r\nextremities; a peripheral extremity, called the _point;_ and a central\r\nextremity, inclosed within the hair sac, or follicle, termed the _root_.\r\nThe root is somewhat greater in diameter than the shaft, and cylindrical\r\nin form, while its lower part expands into an oval mass, called the\r\n_bulb_. The shaft of the hair is not often perfectly cylindrical, but is\r\nmore or less flattened, which circumstance gives rise to waving and\r\ncurling hair; and, when the flattening is spiral in direction, the\r\ncurling will be very great. A hair is composed of three different layers\r\nof cell-tissues: a loose, cellulated substance, which occupies its\r\ncenter, and constitutes the _medulla_, or pith; the fibrous tissue,\r\nwhich incloses the medulla, and forms the chief bulk of the hair; and a\r\nthin layer, which envelops this fibrous structure, and forms the smooth\r\nsurface of the hair. The medulla is absent in the downy hairs, but in\r\nthe coarser class it is always present, especially in white hair. The\r\ncolor of hair is due partly to the granules and partly to an\r\ninter-granular substance, which occupies the interstices of the granules\r\nand the fibers. The quantity of hair varies according to the proximity\r\nand condition of the follicles. The average number of hairs of the head\r\nmay be stated at 1,000 in a superficial square inch; and, as the surface\r\nof the scalp has an area of about one hundred and twenty superficial\r\nsquare inches, the average number of hairs on the entire head is\r\n120,000. The hair possesses great durability, as is evinced by its\r\nendurance of chemical processes, and by its discovery, in the tombs of\r\nmummies more than two thousand years old. The hair is remarkable for its\r\nelasticity and strength. Hair is found to differ materially from horn in\r\nits chemical composition. According to Vauquelin, its constituents are\r\nanimal matter, a greenish-black oil, a white, concrete oil, phosphate of\r\nlime, a trace of carbonate of lime, oxide of manganese, iron, sulphur,\r\nand silex. Red hair contains a reddish oil, a large proportion of\r\nsulphur, and a small quantity of iron. White hair contains a white oil,\r\nand phosphate of magnesia. It has been supposed that hair grows after\r\ndeath, but this theory was probably due to the lengthening of the hair\r\nby the absorption of moisture from the body or atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe _nails_ constitute another class of appendages of the skin. They\r\nconsist of thin plates of horny tissue, having a root, a body, and a\r\nfree extremity. The root, as well as the lateral portion, is implanted\r\nin the skin, and has a thin margin which is received into a groove of\r\nthe true skin. The under surface is furrowed, while the upper is\r\ncomparatively smooth. The nails grow in the same manner as the cuticle.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nPHYSIOLOGICAL ANATOMY.\r\n\r\nSECRETION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe term _Secretion_, in its broadest sense, is applied to that process\r\nby which substances are separated from the blood, either for the\r\nreparation of the tissues or for excretion. In the animal kingdom this\r\nprocess is less complicated than in vegetables. In the former it is\r\nreally a _separation_ of nutritive material from the blood. The process,\r\nwhen effected for the removal of effete matter, is, in a measure,\r\nchemical, and accordingly the change is greater.\r\n\r\nThree elementary constituents are observed in secretory organs: the\r\ncells, a basement membrane, and the blood-vessels. Obviously, the most\r\n_essential_ part is the _cell_.\r\n\r\nThe physical condition necessary for the healthy action of the secretory\r\norgans is a copious supply of blood, in which the nutritive materials\r\nare abundant. The nervous system also influences the process of\r\nsecretion to a great extent. Intense emotion will produce tears, and the\r\nsight of some favorite fruit will generally increase the flow of saliva.\r\n\r\nThe process of secretion depends upon the anatomical and chemical\r\nconstitution of the cell-tissues. The principal secretions are (1),\r\nPerspiration; (2), Tears; (3), Sebaceous matter; (4), Mucus; (5),\r\nSaliva; (6), Gastric juice; (7), Intestinal juice; (8), Pancreatic\r\njuice; (9), Bile; (10), Milk.\r\n\r\nPERSPIRATION is a watery fluid secreted in minute glands, which are\r\nsituated in every part of the skin, but are more numerous on the\r\nanterior surfaces of the body. Long thread-like tubes, only 1/100th of\r\nan inch in diameter, lined with epithelium, penetrate the skin, and\r\nterminate in rounded coils, enveloped by a net-work of capillaries,\r\nwhich supply the secretory glands with blood. It is estimated by Krause\r\nthat the entire number of perspiratory glands is two million three\r\nhundred and eighty-one thousand two hundred and forty-eight, and the\r\nlength of each glandular coil being 1/16 of an inch, we may estimate the\r\nlength of tubing to be not less than two miles and a third. This\r\nsecretion has a specific gravity of 1003.5, and, according to Dr.\r\nDalton, is composed of\r\n\r\n    Water,                                           995.50\r\n    Chloride of Sodium,                                2.23\r\n    Chloride of Potassium,                             0.24\r\n    Sulphate of Soda and Potassa,                      0.01\r\n    Salts of organic acids, with Soda and Potassa,     2.02\r\n                                                    -------\r\n                                                    1000.00\r\n\r\nTraces of organic matter, mingled with a free volatile acid, are also\r\nfound in the perspiration. It is the acid which imparts to this\r\nsecretion its peculiar odor, and acid reaction. The process of its\r\nsecretion is continuous, but, like all bodily functions, it is subject\r\nto influences which augment or retard its activity. If, as is usually\r\nthe case when the body is in a state of repose, evaporation prevents its\r\nappearance in the _liquid_ form, it is called _invisible_ or _insensible\r\nperspiration_. When there is unusual muscular activity, it collects upon\r\nthe skin, and is known as _sensible perspiration_. This secretion\r\nperforms an important office in the animal economy, by maintaining the\r\ninternal temperature at about 100° Fahr. Even in the Arctic regions,\r\nwhere the explorer has to adapt himself to a temperature of 40° to 80°\r\nbelow zero, the generation of heat in the body prevents the internal\r\ntemperature from falling below this standard. On the contrary, if the\r\ncirculation is quickened by muscular exertion, the warmer blood flowing\r\nfrom the internal organs into the capillaries, raises the temperature of\r\nthe skin, secretion is augmented, the moisture exudes from the pores,\r\nand perceptible evaporation begins. A large portion of the animal heat\r\nis thrown off in this process, and the temperature of the skin is\r\nreduced. A very warm, dry atmosphere can be borne with impunity but if\r\nmoisture is introduced, evaporation ceases, and the life of the animal\r\nis endangered. Persons have been known to remain in a temperature of\r\nabout 300° Fahr. for some minutes without unpleasant effects. Three\r\nconditions may be assigned as effective causes in retarding or\r\naugmenting this cutaneous secretion, variations in the temperature of\r\nthe atmosphere, muscular activity, and influences which affect the\r\nnerves. The emotions exert a remarkable influence upon the action of the\r\nperspiratory glands. Intense fear causes great drops of perspiration to\r\naccumulate on the skin, while the salivary glands remain inactive.\r\n\r\nTEARS. The lachrymal glands are small lobular organs, situated at the\r\nouter and upper orbit of the eye, and have from six to eight ducts,\r\nwhich open upon the conjunctiva, between the eyelid and its inner fold.\r\nThis secretion is an alkaline, watery fluid. According to Dr. Dalton,\r\nits composition is as follows:\r\n\r\n    Water,                    882.0\r\n    Albuminous matter,          5.0\r\n    Chloride of Sodium,        13.0\r\n    Mineral Salts, a trace,\r\n                             ------\r\n                             1000.0\r\n\r\nThe function of this secretion is to preserve the brilliancy of the eye.\r\nThe tears are spread over this organ by the reflex movement of the\r\neyelid, called winking, and then collected in the _puncta lachrymalia_\r\nand discharged into the nasal passage. This process is constant during\r\nlife. The effect of its repression is seen in the dim appearance of the\r\neye after death. Grief or excessive laughter usually excite these glands\r\nuntil there is an overflow.\r\n\r\nSEBACEOUS MATTER. Three varieties of this secretion are found in the\r\nbody. A product of the sebaceous glands of the skin is found in those\r\nparts of the body which are covered with hairs; also, on the face and\r\nthe external surface of the organs of generation. The _sebaceous glands_\r\nconsist of a group of flask-shaped cavities, opening into a common\r\nexcretory duct. Their secretion serves to lubricate the hair and soften\r\nthe skin. The _ceruminous glands_ of the _external auditory meatus_, or\r\nouter opening of the ear, are long tubes terminating in a glandular\r\ncoil, within which is secreted the glutinous matter of the ear. This\r\nsecretion serves the double purpose of moistening the outer surface of\r\nthe membrana tympani, or ear-drum, and, by its strong odor, of\r\npreventing the intrusion of insects. The _Meibomian glands_ are arranged\r\nin the form of clusters along the excretory duct, which opens just\r\nbehind the roots of the eyelashes. The oily nature of this secretion\r\nprevents the tears, when not stimulated by emotion, from overflowing the\r\nlachrymal canal.\r\n\r\nMUCUS. The mucous membranes are provided with minute glands which\r\nsecrete a viscid, gelatinous matter, called _mucus_. The peculiar animal\r\nmatter which it contains is termed _mucosin_. These glands are most\r\nnumerous in the Pharynx, Esophagus, Trachea, Bronchia, Vagina and\r\nUrethra. They consist of a group of secreting sacs, terminating at one\r\nextremity in a closed tube, while the other opens into a common duct.\r\nThe mucus varies in composition in different parts of the body; but in\r\nall, it contains a small portion of insoluble animal matter. Its\r\nfunctions are threefold. It lubricates the membranes, prevents their\r\ninjury, and facilitates the passage of food through the alimentary\r\ncanal.\r\n\r\nSALIVA. This term is given to the first of the digestive fluids, which\r\nis secreted in the glands of the mouth. It is a viscid, alkaline liquid,\r\nwith a specific gravity of about 1005. If allowed to stand, a whitish\r\nprecipitate is formed. Examinations with the microscope show it to be\r\ncomposed of minute, granular cells and oil globules, mingled with\r\nnumerous scales of epithelium. According to Bidder and Schmidt, the\r\ncomposition of saliva is as follows:\r\n\r\n    Water,                                        995.16\r\n    Organic matter,                                 1.34\r\n    Sulpho-cyanide of Potassium,                    0.06\r\n    Phosphates of Sodium, Calcium and Magnesium,     .98\r\n    Chlorides of Sodium and Potassium,               .84\r\n    Mixture of Epithelium,                          1.62\r\n                                                 -------\r\n                                                 1000.00\r\n\r\nTwo kinds of organic matter are present in the saliva; one, termed\r\n_ptyalin_, imparts to the saliva its viscidity, and it obtained from the\r\nsecretions of the parotid, submaxillary and sublingual glands; another,\r\nwhich is not glutinous, is distinguished by the property of coagulating\r\nwhen subjected to heat. The saliva is composed of four elementary\r\nsecretions, derived respectively, from the mucous follicles of the\r\nmouth, and the parotid, the submaxillary, and the sublingual glands. The\r\nprocess of its secretion is constant, but is greatly augmented by the\r\ncontact of food with the lining membrane. The saliva serves to moisten\r\nthe triturated food, facilitate its passage, and has the property of\r\nconverting starch into sugar; but the latter quality is counteracted by\r\nthe action of the gastric juice of the stomach.\r\n\r\nGASTRIC JUICE. The minute tubes, or follicles, situated in the mucous\r\nmembrane of the stomach, secrete a colorless, acid liquid, termed the\r\ngastric juice. This fluid appears to consist of little more than water,\r\ncontaining a few saline matters in solution, and a small quantity of\r\nfree hydrochloric acid, which gives it an acid reaction. In addition to\r\nthese, however, it contains a small quantity of a peculiar organic\r\nsubstance, termed _pepsin_, which in chemical composition, is very\r\nsimilar to ptyalin, although it is very different in its effects. When\r\nfood is introduced into the stomach, the peristaltic contractions of\r\nthat organ roll it about, and mingle it with the gastric juice, which\r\ndisintegrates the connective tissue, and converts the albuminous\r\nportions into the substance called chyme, which is about the consistency\r\nof pea-soup, and which is readily absorbed through the animal membranes\r\ninto the blood of the delicate and numerous vessels of the stomach,\r\nwhence it is conveyed to the portal vein and to the liver. The secretion\r\nof the gastric juice is influenced by nervous conditions. Excess of joy\r\nor grief effectually retard or even arrest its flow.\r\n\r\nINTESTINAL JUICE. In the small intestine, a secretion is found which is\r\ntermed the _intestinal juice_. It is the product of two classes of\r\nglands situated in the mucous membrane, and termed respectively, the\r\n_follicles of Lieberkuhn_ and the _glands of Brunner_. The former\r\nconsist of numerous small tubes, lined with epithelium, which secrete by\r\nfar the greater portion of this fluid. The latter are clusters of round\r\nfollicles opening into a common excretory duct. These sacs are composed\r\nof delicate, membranous tissue, having numerous nuclei on their walls.\r\nThe difficulty of obtaining this juice for experiment is obvious, and\r\ntherefore its chemical composition and physical properties are not\r\nknown. The intestinal juice resembles the secretion of the mucous\r\nfollicles of the mouth, being colorless, vitreous in appearance, and\r\nhaving an alkaline reaction.\r\n\r\nPANCREATIC JUICE. This is a colorless fluid, secreted in a lobular gland\r\nwhich is situated behind the stomach, and runs transversely from the\r\nspleen across the vertebral column to the duodenum. The most important\r\nconstituent of the pancreatic juice is an organic substance, termed\r\n_pancreatin_.\r\n\r\nTHE BILE. The blood which is collected by the veins of the stomach,\r\npancreas, spleen, and intestines, is discharged into a large trunk\r\ncalled the portal vein, which enters the liver. This organ also receives\r\narterial blood from a vessel called the _hepatic artery_, which is given\r\noff from the aorta below the diaphragm. If the branches of the portal\r\nvein and hepatic artery be traced into the substance of the liver, they\r\nwill be found to accompany one another, and to subdivide, becoming\r\nsmaller and smaller. Finally, the portal vein and hepatic artery will be\r\nfound to terminate in capillaries which permeate the smallest\r\nperceptible subdivisions of the liver substance, which are polygonal\r\nmasses of not more than one-tenth of an inch in diameter, called the\r\n_lobules_. Every lobule rests upon one of the ramifications of a great\r\nvessel termed the _hepatic vein_, which empties into the inferior vena\r\ncava. There is also a vessel termed the _hepatic duct_ leading from the\r\nliver, the minute subdivisions of which penetrate every portion of the\r\nsubstance of that organ. Connected with the hepatic duct, is the duct of\r\na large oval sac, called the _gall-bladder_.\r\n\r\nEach lobule of the liver is composed of minute cellular bodies known as\r\nthe _hepatic cells_. It is supposed that in these cells the blood is\r\ndeprived of certain materials which are converted into bile. This\r\nsecretion is a glutinous fluid, varying in color from a dark golden\r\nbrown to a bright yellow, has a specific gravity ranging from 1018 to\r\n1036, and a slightly alkaline reaction. When agitated, it has a frothy\r\nappearance. Physiologists have experienced much difficulty in studying\r\nthe character of this secretion from the instability of its constituents\r\nwhen subjected to chemical examination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 52.\r\nSection of the Liver, showing the\r\nramifications of the portal vein. 1. Twig\r\nof portal vein. 2, 2', 2\", 2\"'. Interlobular\r\nvein. 3, 3', 3\", Lobules.]\r\n\r\n_Biliverdin_ is an organic substance peculiar to the bile, which imparts\r\nto that secretion its color. When this constituent is re-absorbed by the\r\nblood and circulates through the tissues, the skin assumes a bright\r\nyellow hue, causing what is known as the jaundice. _Cholesterin_ is an\r\ninflammable crystallizable substance soluble in alcohol or ether. It is\r\nfound in the spleen and all the nervous tissues. It is highly probable\r\nthat it exists in the blood, in some state or combination, and assumes a\r\ncrystalline form only when acted upon by other substances or elements.\r\nTwo other constituents, more important than either of the above, are\r\ncollectively termed _biliary salts_. These elements were discovered in\r\n1848, by Strecker, who termed them _glycocholate_ and _taurocholate of\r\nsoda_. Both are crystalline, resinous substances, and, although\r\nresembling each other in many respects, the chemist may distinguish them\r\nby their reaction, for both yield a precipitate if treated with\r\nsubacetate of lead, but only the glycocholate will give a precipitate\r\nwith acetate of lead. In testing for biliary substances, the most\r\nsatisfactory method is the one proposed by Pettenkoffer. A solution of\r\ncane-sugar, one part of sugar to four parts of water, is mixed with the\r\nsuspected substance. Dilute sulphuric acid is then added until a white\r\nprecipitate falls, which is re-dissolved in an excess of the acid. On\r\nthe addition of more sulphuric acid, it becomes opalescent, and passes\r\nthrough the successive hues of scarlet, lake, and a rich purple. Careful\r\nexperiments have proved that it is a _constant_ secretion; but its flow\r\nis mere abundant during digestion. During the passage through the\r\nintestines it disappears. It is not eliminated, and Pettenkoffer's test\r\nhas failed to detect its existence in the portal vein. These facts lead\r\nphysiologists to the conclusion, that it undergoes some transformation\r\nin the intestines and is re-absorbed.\r\n\r\nAfter digestion has been going on in the stomach for some time, the\r\nsemi-digested food, in the form of chyme, begins to pass through the\r\n_pyloric orifice_ of the stomach into the duodenum, or upper portion of\r\nthe small intestine. Here it encounters the intestinal juice, pancreatic\r\njuice, and the bile, the secretion of all of which is stimulated by the\r\npresence of food in the alimentary tract. These fluids, mingling with\r\nthe chyme, give it an alkaline reaction, and convert it into chyle. The\r\ntransformation of starch into sugar, which is almost, if not entirely,\r\nsuspended while the food remains in the stomach, owing to the acidity of\r\nthe chyme, is resumed in the duodenum, the acid of the chyme, being\r\nneutralized by the alkaline secretions there encountered.\r\n\r\nLate researches have demonstrated that the pancreatic juice exerts a\r\npowerful effect on albuminous matters, not unlike that of the gastric\r\njuice.\r\n\r\nThus, it seems that while in the mouth only starchy, and while in the\r\nstomach only albuminous substances are digested, in the small intestine\r\nall kinds of food materials, starchy, albuminoid, fatty and mineral, are\r\neither completely dissolved, or minutely subdivided, and so prepared\r\nthat they may be readily absorbed through the animal membranes into the\r\nvessels.\r\n\r\nMILK. The milk is a white, opaque fluid, secreted in the lacteal glands\r\nof the female, in the mammalia. These glands consist of numerous\r\nfollicles, grouped around an excretory duct, which unites with similar\r\nducts coming from other lobules. By successive unions, they form large\r\nbranches, termed the _lactiferous ducts_, which open by ten to fourteen\r\nminute orifices on the extremity of the nipple. The most important\r\nconstituent of milk is _casein_; it also contains oily and saccharine\r\nsubstances. This secretion, more than any other, as influenced by\r\nnervous conditions. A mother's bosom will fill with milk at the thought\r\nof her infant child. Milk is sometimes poisoned by a fit of ill-temper,\r\nand the infant made sick and occasionally thrown into convulsions, which\r\nin some instances prove fatal. Sir Astley Cooper mentions two cases in\r\nwhich terror instantaneously and permanently arrested this secretion. It\r\nis also affected by the food and drink. Malt liquors and other mild\r\nalcoholic beverages temporarily increase the amount of the secretion,\r\nand may, in rare instances, have a beneficial effect upon the mother.\r\nThey sometimes affect the child, however, and their use is not to be\r\nrecommended unless the mother is extremely debilitated, and there is a\r\ndeficiency of milk.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nPHYSIOLOGICAL ANATOMY.\r\n\r\nEXCRETION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe products resulting from the waste of the tissues are constantly\r\nbeing poured into the blood, and, as we have seen, the blood being\r\neverywhere full of corpuscles, which, like all living things, die and\r\ndecay, the products of their decomposition accumulate in every part of\r\nthe circulatory system. Hence, if the blood is to be kept pure, the\r\nwaste materials incessantly poured into this fluid, or generated in it,\r\nmust be as continually removed, or excreted. The principal sets of\r\norgans concerned in effecting the separation of excrementitious\r\nsubstances from the blood are the lungs, the skin, and the kidneys.\r\n\r\nThe elimination of carbonic acid through the lungs has already been\r\ndescribed on page 66, and the excretory function of the skin on page 70.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 53.\r\nView of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder. ]\r\n\r\nThe kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, placed at the back of the\r\nabdominal cavity, in the region of the loins, one on each side of the\r\nspine. The convex side of each kidney is directed outwards, and the\r\nconcave side is turned inwards towards the spine. From the middle of the\r\nconcave side, which is termed the _hilus_, a long tube of small caliber,\r\ncalled the _ureter_, proceeds to the bladder. The latter organ is an\r\noval bag, situated in the pelvic cavity. It is composed principally of\r\nelastic muscular fibers, and is lined internally with mucous membrane,\r\nand coated externally with a layer of the _peritoneum_, the serous\r\nmembrane which lines the abdominal and pelvic cavities. The ureters\r\nenter the bladder through its posterior and lower wall, at some little\r\ndistance from each other. The openings through which the ureters enter\r\nthe bladder are oblique, hence it is much easier for the secretion of\r\nthe kidneys to pass from the ureters into the bladder than for it to get\r\nthe other way. Leading from the bladder to the exterior of the body is a\r\ntube, called the _urethra_, through which the urine is voided.\r\n\r\nThe excretion of the kidneys, termed the _urine_, is an amber-colored or\r\nstraw-colored fluid, naturally having a slightly acid reaction, and a\r\nspecific gravity ranging from 1,015 to 1,025. Its principal constituents\r\nare _urea_ and _uric acid_, together with various other animal matters\r\nof less importance, and saline substances, held in solution in a\r\nproportionately large amount of water. The composition of the urine and\r\nthe quantity excreted vary considerably, being influenced by the\r\nmoisture and temperature of the atmosphere, by the character of the food\r\nconsumed, and by the empty or replete condition of the alimentary tract.\r\nOn an average a healthy man secretes about fifty ounces of urine in the\r\ntwenty-four hours. This quantity usually holds in solution about one\r\nounce of urea, and ten or twelve grains of uric acid. In the amount of\r\nother animal matters, and saline substances, there is great variation,\r\nthe quantity of these ranging from a quarter of an ounce to an ounce.\r\nThe principal saline substances are common salt, the sulphates and\r\nphosphates of potassium, sodium, calcium, and magnesium. In addition to\r\nthe animal and the saline matters, the urine also contains a small\r\nquantity of carbonic acid, oxygen and nitrogen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nPHYSIOLOGICAL ANATOMY.\r\n\r\nTHE NERVOUS SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n\r\nHitherto, we have only considered the anatomy and functions of the\r\norgans employed in Digestion, Absorption, Circulation, Respiration,\r\nSecretion and Excretion. We have found the vital process of nutrition to\r\nbe, in all its essential features, a result of physical and chemical\r\nforces; in each instance we have presupposed the existence and activity\r\nof the nerves. There is not an inch of bodily tissue into which their\r\ndelicate filaments do not penetrate, and form a multitude of conductors,\r\nover which are sent the impulses of motion and sensation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 54.\r\nThe Nervous System.]\r\n\r\nTwo elements, _nerve-fibers_ and _ganglionic corpuscles_, enter into the\r\ncomposition of nervous tissue. Ordinary nerve-fibers in the living\r\nsubject, or when fresh, are cylindrical-shaped filaments of a clear, but\r\nsomewhat oily appearance. But soon after death the matter contained in\r\nthe fiber coagulates, and then the fiber is seen to consist of an\r\nextremely delicate, structureless, outer membrane, which forms a tube\r\nthrough the center of which runs the _axis-cylinder_. Interposed between\r\nthe axis-cylinder and this tube, there is a fluid, containing a\r\nconsiderable quantity of fatty matter, from which is deposited a highly\r\nrefracting substance which lines the tube. There are two sets of\r\nnerve-fibers, those which transmit sensory impulses, called _afferent_\r\nor _sensory_ nerves, and those which transmit motor impulses, called\r\n_efferent_ or _motor_ nerves. The fibers when collected in bundles are\r\ntermed nerve trunks. All the larger nerve-fibers lie side by side in the\r\nnerve-trunks, and are bound together by delicate connective tissue,\r\nenclosed in a sheath of the same material, termed the _neurilemma_. The\r\nnerve-fibers in the trunks of the nerves remain perfectly distinct and\r\ndisconnected from one another, and seldom, or never, divide throughout\r\ntheir entire length. However, where the nerves enter the nerve-centers,\r\nand near their outer terminations, the nerve-fibres often divide into\r\nbranches, or at least gradually diminish in size, until, finally, the\r\naxis-cylinder, and the sheath with its fluid contents, are no longer\r\ndistinguishable. The investing membrane is continuous from the origin to\r\nthe termination of the nerve-trunk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 55.\r\nDivision of a\r\nnerve, showing a\r\nportion of a nervous\r\ntrunk (_a_)\r\nand separation of\r\nits filaments (_b, c, d, e_.)]\r\n\r\nIn the brain and spinal cord the nerve-fibers often terminate in minute\r\nmasses of a gray or ash-colored granular substance, termed _ganglia_, or\r\n_ganglionic corpuscles_.\r\n\r\nThe ganglia are cellular corpuscles of irregular form, and possess\r\nfibrous appendages, which serve to connect them with one another. These\r\nganglia form the cortical covering of the brain, and are also found in\r\nthe interior of the spinal cord. According to Kölliker, the larger of\r\nthese nerve-cells measure only 1/200 of an inch in diameter. The brain\r\nis chiefly composed of nervous ganglia.\r\n\r\nNerves are classified with reference to their origin, as\r\n_cerebral_--those originating in the brain, and _spinal_--those\r\noriginating in the spinal cord.\r\n\r\nThere are two sets of nerves and nerve-centers, which are intimately\r\nconnected, but which can be more conveniently studied apart. These are\r\nthe _cerebro-spinal_ system, consisting of the cerebro-spinal axis, and\r\nthe cerebral and spinal nerves; and the _sympathetic_ system, consisting\r\nof the chain of sympathetic ganglia, the nerves which they give off, and\r\nthe nervous trunks which connect them with one another and with the\r\ncerebro-spinal nerves.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CEREBRO-SPINAL SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CEREBRO-SPINAL AXIS consists of the brain and spinal cord. It lies\r\nin the cavities of the cranium and the spinal column. These cavities are\r\nlined with a very tough fibrous membrane, termed the _dura mater_, which\r\nserves as the periosteum of the bones which enter into the formation of\r\nthese parts. The surface of the brain and spinal cord is closely\r\ninvested with an extremely vascular, areolar tissue, called the _pia\r\nmater_. The numerous blood-vessels which supply these organs traverse\r\nthe pia mater for some distance, and, where they pass into the substance\r\nof the brain or spinal cord, the fibrous tissue of this membrane\r\naccompanies them to a greater or less depth. The inner surface of the\r\ndura mater and the outer surface of the pia mater are covered with an\r\nextremely thin, serous membrane, which is termed the _arachnoid_\r\nmembrane. Thus, one layer of the arachnoid envelopes the brain and\r\nspinal cord, and the other lines the dura mater. As the layers become\r\ncontinuous with each other at different points, the arachnoid, like the\r\npericardium, forms a shut sac, and, like other serous membranes, it\r\nsecretes a fluid, known as the _arachnoid fluid_. The space between the\r\ninternal and the external layers of the arachnoid membrane of the brain\r\nis much smaller than that enclosed by the corresponding layers of the\r\narachnoid membrane of the spinal column.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 56.\r\nCross-section of spinal cord.]\r\n\r\nTHE SPINAL CORD is a column of soft, grayish-white substance, extending\r\nfrom the top of the spinal canal, where it is continuous with the brain,\r\nto about an inch below the small of the back, where it tapers off into a\r\nfilament. From this nerve are distributed fibers and filaments to the\r\nmuscles and integument of at least nine-tenths of the body.\r\n\r\nThe spinal cord is divided in front through the middle nearly as far as\r\nits center, by a deep fissure, called the _anterior fissure_, and\r\nbehind, in a similar manner, by the posterior _fissure_. Each of these\r\nfissures is lined with the pia mater, which also supports the\r\nblood-vessels which supply the spinal cord with blood. Consequently, the\r\nsubstance of the two halves of the cord is only connected by a narrow\r\nisthmus, or bridge, perforated by a minute tube, which is termed the\r\n_central canal_ of the spinal cord.\r\n\r\nEach half of the spinal cord is divided lengthwise into three nearly\r\nequal parts, which are termed the anterior, lateral, and posterior\r\ncolumns, by the lines which join together two parallel series of bundles\r\nof nervous filaments, which compose the roots of the spinal nerves. The\r\nroots of those nerves, which are found along that line nearest the\r\nposterior surface of the cord, are termed the posterior roots; those\r\nwhich spring from the other line are known as the anterior roots.\r\n\r\nSeveral of these anterior and posterior roots, situated at about the\r\nsame height on opposite sides of the spinal cord, converge and combine\r\ninto what are called the _anterior_ and _posterior bundles_; then two\r\nbundles, anterior and posterior, unite and form the trunk of a spinal\r\nnerve.\r\n\r\nThe nerve trunks make their way out of the spinal canal through\r\napertures between the vertebra, called the _inter-vertebral foramina_\r\nand then divide into numerous branches, their ramifications extending\r\nprincipally to the muscles and the skin. There are thirty-one pairs of\r\nspinal nerves, eight of which are termed cervical, twelve dorsal, five\r\nlumbar, and six sacral, with reference to that part of the cord from\r\nwhich they originate.\r\n\r\nWhen the cord is divided into transverse sections, it is found that each\r\nhalf is composed of two kinds of matter, a white substance on the\r\noutside, and a grayish substance in the interior. The _gray matter_, as\r\nit is termed, lies in the form of an irregular crescent, with one end\r\nconsiderably larger than the other, and having the concave side turned\r\noutwards. The ends of the crescent are termed the _horns_, or _cornua_,\r\nthe one pointing forward being called the _anterior cornu_, the other\r\none the _posterior cornu_. The convex sides of these cornua approach\r\neach other and are united by the bridge, which contains the central\r\ncanal.\r\n\r\nThere is a marked difference in the structure of the gray and the white\r\nmatter. The white matter is composed entirely of nerve fibers, held\r\ntogether by a framework of connective tissue. The gray matter contains a\r\ngreat number of ganglionic corpuscles, or nerve-cells, in addition to\r\nthe nerve-fibers.\r\n\r\nWhen the nerve-trunks are irritated in any manner, whether by pinching,\r\nburning, or the application of electricity, all the muscles which are\r\nsupplied with branches from this nerve-trunk immediately contract, and\r\npain is experienced, the severity of which depends upon the degree of\r\nthe irritation; and the pain is attributed to that portion of the body\r\nto which the filaments of the nerve-trunk are distributed. Thus, persons\r\nwho have lost limbs often complain in cold weather of an uneasiness or\r\npain, which they locate in the fingers or toes of the limb which has\r\nbeen amputated, and which is caused by the cold producing an irritation\r\nof the nerve-trunk, the filaments, or fibers of which, supplied the\r\nfingers or toes of the lost member.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if the anterior bundle of nerve-fibers given off from\r\nthe spinal cord is irritated in precisely the same way, only half of\r\nthese effects is produced. All the muscles which are supplied with\r\nfibers from that trunk contract, but no pain is experienced. Conversely,\r\nif the posterior bundle of nerve-fibers is irritated, none of the\r\nmuscles to which the filaments of the nerve are distributed contract,\r\nbut pain is felt throughout the entire region to which these filaments\r\nare extended. It is evident, from these facts, that the fibers composing\r\nthe posterior bundles of nerve-roots only transmit sensory impulses, and\r\nthe filaments composing the anterior nerve-roots only transmit motor\r\nimpulses; accordingly, they are termed respectively the _sensory_ and\r\nthe _motor_ nerve-roots. This is illustrated by the fact that when the\r\nposterior root of a spinal nerve is divided, all sensation in the parts\r\nto which the filaments of that nerve are distributed is lost, but the\r\npower of voluntary movement of the muscles remains. On the other hand,\r\nif the anterior roots are severed, the power of voluntary motion of the\r\nmuscles is lost, but sensation remains.\r\n\r\nIt appears from these experiments, that, when a nerve is irritated, a\r\nchange in the arrangement of its molecules takes place, which is\r\ntransmitted along the nerve-fibers. But, if the nerve-trunks are\r\ndivided, or compressed tightly at any point between the portion\r\nirritated, and the muscle or nerve-centre, the effect ceases\r\nimmediately, in a manner similar to that in which a message is stopped\r\nby the cutting of a telegraph wire. When the nerves distributed to a\r\nlimb are subjected to a pressure sufficient to destroy the molecular\r\ncontinuity of their filaments, it \"goes to sleep,\" as we term it. The\r\npower of transmitting sensory and motor impulses is lost, and only\r\nreturns gradually, as the molecular continuity is restored.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said, it is plain that a sensory nerve is one which\r\nconveys a sensory impulse from the peripheral or outer part of a nerve\r\nto the spinal cord or brain, and which is, therefore, termed _afferent_;\r\nand that a motor nerve is one which transmits an impulse from the nerve\r\ncentre, or is _efferent_. So difference in structure, or in chemical or\r\nphysical composition, can be discerned between the afferent and the\r\n_efferent_ nerves. A certain period of time is required for the\r\ntransmission of all impulses. The speed with which an impulse travels\r\nhas been found to be comparatively slow, being even less than that of\r\nsound, which is 1,120 feet per second.\r\n\r\nThe experiments heretofore related have been confined solely to the\r\nnerves. We may now proceed to the consideration of what takes place when\r\nthe spinal cord is operated upon in a similar way. If the cord be\r\ndivided with a knife or other instrument, all parts of the body supplied\r\nwith nerves given off below the division will become paralyzed and\r\ninsensible, while all parts of the body supplied with nerves from the\r\nspinal cord _above_ the division will retain their sensibility and power\r\nof motion. If, however, only the posterior half of the spinal cord is\r\ndivided, or destroyed, there is loss of sensation alone; and, if the\r\nanterior portion is cut in two, and the continuity of the posterior part\r\nis left undisturbed, there is loss of voluntary motion of the lower\r\nlimbs, but sensation remains.\r\n\r\nREFLEX ACTION OF THE SPINAL CORD. In relation to the brain, the spinal\r\ncord is a great mixed motor and sensory nerve, but, in addition to this,\r\nit is also a distinct nervous centre, in which originate and terminate\r\nall those involuntary impulses which exert so potent an influence in the\r\npreservation and economy of the body. That peculiar power of the cord by\r\nwhich it is enabled to convert sensory into motor impulse is that which\r\ndistinguishes it, as a central organ, from a nerve, and is called\r\n_reflex action_.\r\n\r\nThe gray matter, and not the white, is the part of the cord which\r\npossesses this power. This reflex action is a special function of the\r\nspinal cord, and serves as a monitor to, and regulator of the organs of\r\nnutrition and circulation, by placing them, ordinarily, beyond the\r\ncontrol of conscious volition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 57.]\r\n\r\nIf the foot of a decapitated frog is irritated, there is an instant\r\ncontraction of the corresponding limb; if the irritation is intense the\r\nother limb also contracts. These motions indicate the existence, in some\r\npart of the spinal cord, of a distinct nerve-centre, capable of\r\nconverting and reflecting impulses. It has been found by experiment,\r\nthat the same movements will take place if the irritation be applied to\r\nany portion of the body to which the spinal nerves are distributed, thus\r\ngiving undoubted evidence that the spinal cord in its entirety is\r\ncapable of causing these reflections. Fig. 57 represents the course of\r\nthe nervous impulses. The sensory impulse passes upward along the\r\nposterior root, _a_, until it reaches the imbedded gray matter, _b_, of\r\nthe cord, by which it is reflected, as a motor impulse, downward along\r\nthe anterior root, _c_, to the muscles whence the sensation was\r\nreceived. This is the reflex action of the spinal cord. There is no\r\nconsciousness or sensation connected with this action, and the removal\r\nof the brain and the sympathetic system does not diminish its activity.\r\nEven after death it continues for some time, longer in cold-blooded than\r\nin warm-blooded animals, on account of the difference in temperature,\r\nthus showing this property of the spinal cord. By disease, or the use of\r\ncertain poisons, this activity may be greatly augmented, as is\r\nfrequently observed in the human subject. A sudden contact with a\r\ndifferent atmosphere may induce these movements. The contraction of the\r\nmuscles, or cramp, often experienced by all persons, in stepping into a\r\ncold bath, or emerging from the cozy sitting-room into a chilly December\r\ntemperature, are familiar illustrations of reflex movements. It has been\r\ndemonstrated that the irritability of the nerves may be impaired or\r\ndestroyed, while that of the muscles to which they are distributed\r\nremains unchanged; and that the motor and sensory classes of filaments\r\nmay be paralyzed independently of each other.\r\n\r\nThe reflex actions of the spinal cord have been admirably summed up by\r\nDr. Dalton, as exerting a general, protective influence over the body,\r\npresiding over the involuntary action of the limbs and trunk, regulating\r\nthe action of the sphincters, rectum, and bladder, and, at the same\r\ntime, exercising an indirect influence upon the nutritive changes in all\r\nparts of the body to which the spinal filaments are distributed.\r\n\r\nTHE BRAIN. The brain is a complex organ, which is divided into the\r\n_medulla oblongata_, the _cerebellum_, and the _cerebrum_.\r\n\r\nThe _medulla oblongata_ is situated just above the spinal cord, and is\r\ncontinuous with it below, and the brain above. It has distinct functions\r\nwhich are employed in the preservation and continuance of life. It has\r\nbeen termed the \"vital knot,\" owing to the fact that the brain may be\r\nremoved and the cord injured and still the heart and lungs will continue\r\nto perform their functions, until the medulla oblongata is destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of the white and gray matter of the medulla oblongata is\r\nsimilar to that of the spinal cord; that is to say, the white matter is\r\nexternal and the gray internal; whereas in the cerebellum and cerebrum\r\nthis order is reversed. The fibres of the spinal cord, before entering\r\nthis portion of the brain, decussate, those from the right side crossing\r\nto the left, and those from the left crossing to the right side. By some\r\nauthors this crossing of the sensory and motor filaments has been\r\nsupposed to take place near the medulla oblongata. Dr. Brown-Sequard\r\nshows, however, that it takes place at every part of the spinal cord.\r\nThe medulla oblongata is traversed by a longitudinal fissure, continuous\r\nwith that of the spinal cord. Each of the lateral columns thus formed\r\nare subdivided into sections, termed respectively the _Corpora\r\nPyramidalia_, the _Corpora Olivaria_, the _Corpora Restiformia_ and the\r\n_Posterior Pyramids_.\r\n\r\nThe _Corpora Pyramidalia_ (see 1, 1, Fig. 58) are two small medullary\r\neminences or cords, situated at the posterior surface of the medulla\r\noblongata; approaching the Pons Varolii these become larger and rounded.\r\n\r\nThe _Corpora Olivaria_ (3, 3, Fig. 58) are two elliptical prominences,\r\nplaced exterior to the corpora pyramidalia. By some physiologists these\r\nbodies are considered as the nuclei, or vital points, of the medulla\r\noblongata. Being closely connected with the nerves of special sensation,\r\nDr. Solly supposed that they presided over the movements of the larynx.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 58.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 59.]\r\n\r\nThe _Corpora Restiformia_ (5, 5, Fig. 59) are lateral and posterior\r\nrounded projections of whitish medulla, which pass upward to the\r\ncerebellum and form the _crura cerebelli_, so called because they\r\nresemble a leg. The filaments of the pneumogastric nerve originate in\r\nthe ganglia of these parts.\r\n\r\nThe _Posterior Pyramids_ are much smaller than the other columns of the\r\nmedulla oblongata. They are situated (4, 4, Fig. 59) upon the margin of\r\nthe posterior fissures in contact with each other.\r\n\r\nThe functions of the medulla oblongata, which begin with the earliest\r\nmanifestations of life, are of an instinctive character. If the\r\ncerebellum and cerebrum of a dove be removed, the bird will make no\r\neffort to procure food, but if a crumb of bread be placed in its bill,\r\nit is swallowed naturally and without any special effort. So also in\r\nrespiration the lungs continue to act after the intercostal muscles are\r\nparalyzed; if the diaphragm loses its power, suffocation is the result,\r\nbut there is still a convulsive movement of the lungs for sometime,\r\nindicating the continued action of the medulla oblongata.\r\n\r\nThe _Cerebellum_, or little brain, is situated in the posterior chamber\r\nof the skull, beneath the _tentorium_, a tent-like process of the dura\r\nmater which separates it from the cerebrum. It is convex, with a\r\ntransverse diameter of between three and one-half and four inches, and\r\nis little more than two inches in thickness. It is divided on its upper\r\nand lower surfaces into two lateral hemispheres, by the superior and\r\ninferior vermiform processes, and behind by deep notches. The cerebellum\r\nis composed of gray and white matter, the former being darker than that\r\nof the cerebrum. From the beautiful arrangement of tissue, this organ\r\nhas been termed the _arbor vitae_.\r\n\r\nThe _peduncles of the cerebellum_, the means by which it communicates\r\nwith the other portions of the brain, are divided into three pairs,\r\ndesignated as the _superior_, _middle_ and _inferior_. The first pass\r\nupward and forward until they are blended with the tubercles of the\r\n_corpora quadrigemina_. The second are the _crura cerebelli_, which\r\nunite in two large _fasciculi_, or pyramids, and are finally lost in the\r\n_pons varolii_. The inferior peduncles are the corpora restiformia,\r\npreviously described, and consist of both sensory and motor filaments.\r\nSome physiologists suppose that the cerebellum is the source of that\r\nharmony or associative power which co-ordinates all voluntary movements,\r\nand effects that delicate adjustment of cause to effect, displayed in\r\nmuscular action. This fact may be proved by removing the cerebellum of a\r\nbird and observing the results, which are an uncertainty in all its\r\nmovements, and difficulty in standing, walking, or flying, the bird\r\nbeing unable to direct its course. In the animal kingdom we find an\r\napparent correspondence between the size of the cerebellum and the\r\nvariety and extent of the movements of the animal. Instances are cited,\r\nhowever, in which no such proportion exists, and so the matter is open\r\nto controversy. The general function of the cerebellum, therefore,\r\ncannot be explained, but the latest experiments in physiological and\r\nanatomical science seem to favor the theory that it is in some way\r\nconnected with the harmony of the movements. This co-ordination, by\r\nwhich the adjustment of voluntary motion is supposed to be effected, is\r\nnot in reality a _faculty_ having its seat in the brain substance, but\r\nis the harmonious action of many forces through the cerebellum.\r\n\r\nThe _Cerebrum_ occupies five times the space of all the other portions\r\nof the brain together. It is of an ovoid form, and becomes larger as it\r\napproaches the posterior region of the skull. A longitudinal fissure\r\ncovered by the dura mater separates the cerebrum into two hemispheres,\r\nwhich are connected at the base of the fissure, by a broad medullary\r\nband, termed the _corpus callosum_. Each hemisphere is subdivided into\r\nthree lobes. The anterior gives form to the forehead, the middle rests\r\nin the cavity at the base of the skull, and the posterior lobe is\r\nsupported by the tentorium, by which it is separated from the cerebellum\r\nbeneath. One of the most prominent characteristics of the cerebrum is\r\nits many and varied _convolutions_ These do not correspond in all\r\nbrains, nor even on the opposite sides of the same brain, yet there are\r\ncertain features of similarity in all; accordingly, anatomists enumerate\r\nfour _orders of convolutions_. The first order begins at the _substantia\r\nperforata_ and passes upward and around the corpus callosum toward the\r\nposterior margin of that body, thence descends to the base of the brain,\r\nand terminates near its origin. The second order originates from the\r\nfirst, and subdivides into two convolutions, one of which composes the\r\nexterior margin and superior part of the corresponding hemisphere, while\r\nthe other forms the circumference of the _fissure of Sylvius_. The third\r\norder, from six to eight in number, is found in the interior portion of\r\nthe brain, and inosculates between the first and second orders. The\r\nfourth is found on the outer surface of the hemisphere, in the space\r\nbetween the sub-orders of the second clasp. A peculiar fact relating to\r\nthese convolutions is observed by all anatomists: mental development is\r\nalways accompanied by an increasing dissimilarity between their\r\nproportional size.\r\n\r\nThe cerebral hemispheres may be injured or lacerated without any pain to\r\nthe patient. The effect seems to be one of stupefaction without\r\nsensation or volition. A well-developed brain is a very good indication\r\nof intelligence and mental activity. That the cerebrum is the seat of\r\nthe reasoning powers, and all the higher intellectual functions, is\r\nproved by three facts. (1.) If this portion of the brain is removed, it\r\nis followed by the loss of intelligence. (2.) If the human cerebrum is\r\ninjured, there is an impairment of the intellectual powers. (3.) In the\r\nanimal kingdom, as a rule, intelligence corresponds to the size of the\r\ncerebrum. This general law of development is modified by differences in\r\nthe cerebral texture. Men possessing comparatively small brains may have\r\na vast range of thought and acute reasoning powers. Anatomists have\r\nfound these peculiarities to depend upon the quantity of gray matter\r\nwhich enters into the composition of the brain.\r\n\r\nIn the cerebro-spinal system there are three different kinds of reflex\r\nactions. (1.) Those of the spinal cord and medulla oblongata are\r\nperformed without any consciousness or sensation on the part of the\r\nsubject. (2.) The second class embraces those of the tuber annulare,\r\nwhere the perception gives rise to motion without the interference of\r\nthe intellectual faculties. These are denominated purely _instinctive_\r\nreflex actions, and include all those operations of animals which seem\r\nto display intelligent forethought; thus, the beaver builds his\r\nhabitation over the water, but not a single apartment is different from\r\nthe beaver homestead of a thousand years ago; there is no improvement,\r\nno retrogression. Trains of thought have been termed a third class of\r\nreflex actions. It is evident that the power of reasoning is, in a\r\ndegree, possessed by some of the lower-animals: for instance, a tribe of\r\nmonkeys on a foraging expedition will station guards at different parts\r\nof the field, to warn the plunderers of the approach of danger. A cry\r\nfrom the sentinel, and general confusion is followed by retreat. Reason\r\nonly attains its highest development in man, in whom it passes the\r\nbounds of ordinary existence, and, with the magic wand of love, reaches\r\noutward into the vast unknown, lifting him above corporeal being, into\r\nan atmosphere of spiritual and divine Truth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 60.\r\nSection of the brain and an ideal\r\nview of the pneumogastric nerve\r\non one side, with its branches, _a_.\r\nVertical section of the cerebrum.\r\n_b_.

From the brain, nerves are given off in pairs, which\r\nsucceed one another from in front backwards to the number of twelve. The\r\n_first_ pair, the _olfactory_ nerves, are the nerves of the sense of\r\nsmell. The _second_ pair are the _optic_, or the nerves of the sense of\r\nsight. The _third_ pair are called the _motores oculi_, the movers of\r\nthe eye, from the fact that they are distributed to all the muscles of\r\nthe eye with the exception of two. The _fourth_ pair and the _sixth_\r\npair each supply one of the muscles of the eye, on each side, the fourth\r\nextending to the superior oblique muscle, and the sixth to the external\r\nrectus muscle. The nerves of the _fifth_ pair are very large; they are\r\neach composed of two bundles of filaments, one motor and the other\r\nsensory, and have, besides, an additional resemblance to a spinal nerve\r\nby having a ganglion on each of their sensory roots, and, from the fact\r\nthat they have three chief divisions, are often called the _trigeminal_,\r\nor _trifacial_, nerves. They are nerves of special sense, of sensation,\r\nand of motion. They are the sensitive nerves which supply the cranium\r\nand face, the motor nerves of the muscles of mastication, the\r\n_buccinator_ and the _masseter_, and their third branches, often called\r\nthe _gustatory_, are distributed to the front portion of the tongue, and\r\nare two of the nerves of the special sense of taste. The _seventh_ pair,\r\ncalled also the _facial_ nerves, are the motor nerves of the muscles of\r\nthe face, and are also distributed to a few other muscles; the _eighth_\r\npair, termed the auditory nerves, are the nerves of the special sense of\r\nhearing. As the _seventh_ and _eighth_ pairs of nerves emerge from the\r\ncavity of the skull together, they are frequently classed by anatomists\r\nas one, divided into the _facial_, or _portio dura_, as it is sometimes\r\ncalled, and the _auditory_, or _portio mollis_. The _ninth_ pair, called\r\nthe _glosso-pharyngeal,_ are mixed nerves, supplying motor filaments to\r\nthe _pharyngeal muscles_ and filaments of the special sense of taste to\r\nthe back portion of the tongue. The _tenth_ pair, called the\r\n_pneumogastric_, or _par vagum_, are very important nerves, and are\r\ndistributed to the larynx, the lungs, the heart, the stomach, and the\r\nliver, as shown in Fig. 60. This pair and the next are the only cerebral\r\nnerves which are distributed to parts of the body distant from the head.\r\nThe _eleventh_ pair, also called _spinal accessory_, arise from the\r\nsides of the spinal marrow, between the anterior and posterior roots of\r\nthe dorsal nerves, and run up to the medulla oblongata, and leave the\r\ncranium by the same aperture as the pneumogastric and glosso-pharyngeal\r\nnerves. They supply certain muscles of the neck, and are purely motor.\r\nAs the glosso-pharyngeal, pneumogastric, and spinal accessory nerves\r\nleave the cranium together, they are by some anatomists counted as the\r\n_eighth_ pair. The _twelfth_ pair, known as the _hypoglossal,_ are\r\ndistributed to the tongue, and are the motor nerves of that organ.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT SYMPATHETIC.\r\n\r\n\r\nA double chain of nervous ganglia extends from the superior to the\r\ninferior parts of the body, at the sides and in front of the spinal\r\ncolumn, and is termed, collectively, the system of the _great\r\nsympathetic_. These ganglia are intimately connected by nervous\r\nfilaments, and communicate with the cerebro-spinal system by means of\r\nthe motor and sensory filaments which penetrate the sympathetic. The\r\nnerves of this system are distributed to those organs over which\r\nconscious volition has no direct control.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 61.\r\nCourse and distribution of the great Sympathetic Nerve]\r\n\r\nFour of the sympathetic centers, situated in the front and lower\r\nportions of the head, are designated as the _ophthalmic,\r\nspheno-palatine, submaxillary_ and _otic ganglia_. The first of these,\r\nas its name indicates, is distributed to the eye, penetrates the\r\n_sclerotic membrane_ (the white, opaque portion of the eyeball, with its\r\ntransparent covering), and influences the contraction and dilation of\r\nthe iris. The second division is situated in the angle formed by the\r\nsphenoid and maxillary bone, or just below the ear. It sends motor and\r\nsensory filaments to the palate, and _velum palati_. Its filaments\r\npenetrate the carotid plexus, are joined by others from the motor roots\r\nof the facial nerve and the sensory fibres of the superior maxillary.\r\nThe third division is located on the submaxillary gland. Its filaments\r\nare distributed to the sides of the tongue, the sublingual, and\r\nsubmaxillary glands. The otic ganglion is placed below the base of the\r\nskull, and also connects with the _carotid plexus_. Its filaments of\r\ndistribution supply the internal muscles of the _malleus_, the largest\r\nbones of the _tympanum_, the membranous linings of the tympanum and the\r\n_eustachian tube._ Three ganglia, usually designated as the _superior,\r\nmiddle_, and _inferior_, connect with the cervical and spinal nerves.\r\nTheir interlacing filaments are distributed to the muscular walls of the\r\nlarynx, pharynx, trachea, and esophagus, and also penetrate the _thyroid\r\ngland_. The use of this gland is not accurately known. It is composed of\r\na soft, brown tissue, and consists of lobules contained in lobes of\r\nlarger size. It forms a spongy covering for the greater portion of the\r\nlarynx, and the first section of the trachea. That it is an important\r\norgan, is evident from the fact that it receives four large arteries,\r\nand filaments from two pairs of nerves.\r\n\r\nThe sympathetic ganglia of the chest correspond in number with the\r\nterminations of the ribs, over which they are situated. Each ganglion\r\nreceives two filaments from the intercostal nerve, situated above it,\r\nthus forming a double connection. The thoracic ganglia supply with motor\r\nfibres that portion of the aorta which is above the diaphragm, the\r\nesophagus, and the lungs.\r\n\r\nIn the abdomen the sympathetic centers are situated upon the _coeliac_\r\nartery, and are termed, collectively, the _semilunar coeliac ganglion_.\r\nNumerous inosculating branches radiate from this center and are called,\r\nfrom the method of their distribution, the _solar plexus_. From this,\r\nalso, originate other plexi which are distributed to the stomach, liver,\r\nkidneys, intestines, spleen, pancreas, supra-renal glands, and to the\r\norgans of generation. Four other pairs of abdominal ganglia connected\r\nwith, the lumbar branches are united by filaments to form the semilunar\r\nganglion.\r\n\r\nThe sympathetic ganglia of the pelvis consist of five pairs, which are\r\nsituated upon the surface of the sacrum. At the extremity of the spinal\r\ncolumn this system terminates in a single knot, designated as the\r\n_ganglion impar_.\r\n\r\nOwing to the position of the sympathetic ganglia, deeply imbedded in the\r\ntissues of the chest and abdomen, it is exceedingly difficult to subject\r\nthem to any satisfactory experiments. A few isolated facts form the\r\nbasis of all our knowledge concerning their functions. They give off\r\nboth motor and sensory filaments. The contraction of the _iris_ is one\r\nof the most familiar examples of the action of the sympathetic system.\r\n\r\nIn the reflex actions of the nerves of special sense, the sensation is\r\ntransmitted through the cerebro-spinal system, and the motor impulse is\r\nsent to the deep-seated muscles by the sympathetic system. Physiologists\r\nenumerate three kinds of reflex actions, which are either purely\r\nsympathetic, or partially influenced by the cerebro-spinal system. Dr.\r\nDalton describes them as follows:\r\n\r\n_First_.--\"Reflex actions taking place from the internal organs, through\r\nthe sympathetic and cerebro-spinal systems, to the voluntary muscles and\r\nsensitive surfaces.--The convulsions of young children are often owing\r\nto the irritation of undigested food in the intestinal canal. Attacks of\r\nindigestion are also known to produce temporary amaurosis [blindness],\r\ndouble vision, strabismus, and even hemiplegia. Nausea, and a diminished\r\nor capricious appetite, are often prominent symptoms of early pregnancy,\r\ninduced by the peculiar condition of the uterine mucous membrane.\"\r\n\r\n_Second_.--\"Reflex actions taking place from the sensitive surfaces,\r\nthrough the cerebro-spinal and sympathetic systems to the involuntary\r\nmuscles and secreting organs.--Imprudent exposure of the integument to\r\ncold and wet, will often bring on a diarrhea. Mental and moral\r\nimpressions, conveyed through the special senses, will affect the\r\nmotions of the heart, and disturb the processes of digestion and\r\nsecretion. Terror, or an absorbing interest of any kind, will produce a\r\ndilatation of the pupil, and communicate in this way a peculiarly wild\r\nand unusual expression to the eye. Disagreeable sights or odors, or even\r\nunpleasant occurrences, are capable of hastening or arresting the\r\nmenstrual discharge, or of inducing premature delivery.\"\r\n\r\n_Third_.--\"Reflex actions taking place through the sympathetic system\r\nfrom one part of the body to another.--The contact of food with the\r\nmucous membrane of the small intestine excites a peristaltic movement in\r\nthe muscular coat. The mutual action of the digestive, urinary, and\r\ninternal generative organs upon each other takes place entirely through\r\nthe medium of the sympathetic ganglia and their nerves. The variation of\r\nthe capillary circulation in different abdominal viscera, corresponding\r\nwith the state of activity or repose of their associated organs, are to\r\nbe referred to a similar nervous influence. These phenomena are not\r\naccompanied by any consciousness on the part of the individual, nor by\r\nany apparent intervention of the cerebro-spinal system.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTHE SPECIAL SENSES.\r\n\r\nSIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe eye is the organ through which we perceive, by the agency of light,\r\nall the varied dimensions relations, positions, and visible qualities of\r\nexternal objects.\r\n\r\nThe number, position, and perfection of the eyes, vary remarkably in\r\ndifferent orders, in many instances corresponding to the mode of life,\r\nhabitation, and food of the animal. A skillful anatomist may ascertain\r\nby the peculiar formation of the eye, without reference to the general\r\nphysical structure, in what element the animal lives. Sight is one of\r\nthe most perfect of the senses, and reveals to man the beauties of\r\ncreation. The aesthetic sentiment is acknowledged to be the most\r\nrefining element of civilized life. Painting, sculpture, architecture,\r\nand all the scenes of nature, from a tiny way-side flower to a Niagara,\r\nare subjects in which the poet's eye sees rare beauties to mirror forth\r\nin the rhythm of immortal verse.\r\n\r\nIn the vertebrates, the organs of vision are supplied with filaments\r\nfrom the second pair of cranial nerves. In mammalia, the eyes are\r\nlimited to two in number, which in man are placed in circular cavities\r\nof the skull, beneath the anterior lobes of the cerebrum. Three\r\nmembranes form the lining of this inner sphere of the eye, called\r\nrespectively the Sclerotic, Choroid, and Retina.\r\n\r\nThe _Sclerotic_, or outer covering, is the white, firm membrane, which\r\nforms the larger visible portion of the eyeball. It is covered in front\r\nby a colorless, transparent segment, termed the _cornea_, which gives\r\nthe eye its lustrous appearance. Within the sclerotic, and lining it\r\nthroughout, is a thin, dark membrane termed the _Choroid_. Behind the\r\ncornea it forms a curtain, called the _iris_, which gives to the eye its\r\ncolor. The muscles of the iris contract or relax according to the amount\r\nof light received, thus enlarging or diminishing the size of the\r\ncircular opening called the _pupil_. The _Retina_ is formed by the optic\r\nnerve, which penetrates the sclerotic and choroid and spreads out into a\r\ndelicate, grayish, semi-transparent membrane. The retina is one of the\r\nmost _essential_ organs of vision, and consists of two layers. A\r\nspheroidal, transparent body, termed the _crystalline lens_, is situated\r\ndirectly behind the pupil. It varies in density, increasing from without\r\ninward, and forms a perfect refractor of the light received. The space\r\nin front of the crystalline lens is separated by the iris into two\r\ncompartments called respectively the _anterior_ and _posterior\r\nchambers_. The fluid contained within them, termed the _aqueous humor_,\r\nis secreted by the cornea, iris, and ciliary processes. The space behind\r\nthe crystalline lens is occupied by a fluid, called the _vitreous\r\nhumor_. This humor is denser than the other fluids and has the\r\nconsistency of jelly, being perfectly transparent. \"The function of the\r\ncrystalline lens is to produce distinct perception of form and\r\noutline.\"[3] The transparent humors of the eye also contribute to the\r\nsame effect, but only act as auxiliaries to the lens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 62.]\r\n\r\nThe figure on the next page represents the course of the rays of light\r\nproceeding from an object _a b_, refracted by the lens, and forming the\r\ninverted image _x y_ on the screen. All rays of light proceeding from\r\n_b_ are concentrated at _y_, and those proceeding from _a_ converge at\r\n_x_. Rays of light emanating from the center of the object _a b_ pursue\r\na parallel course, and form the center of the image. Rays of light\r\npassing through a double convex lens converge at a point called the\r\n_focus_. In the organ of vision, if perfect, the focus is on the retina,\r\nwhich serves as a screen to receive the image or impression. We have a\r\ndistinct perception of the outline of a distant hill, and also of a book\r\nlying before us. The rays of light we receive from these objects cannot\r\nhave the same focus. How, then, can we account for the evident\r\naccommodation of the eye to the varying distances? Various theories have\r\nbeen advanced to explain this adjustment; such as changes in the\r\ncurvature of the cornea and lens; a movement of the lens, or a general\r\nchange in the form of the eyeball, by which the axis may be lengthened\r\nor shortened.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 63.]\r\n\r\nTwo facts comprise all the positive knowledge which we possess on this\r\nsubject. Every person is conscious of a muscular effort in directing the\r\neye to a near object\" as a book, and of fatigue, if the attention is\r\nprolonged. If, now, the eyes be directed to a distant object, there will\r\nresult a sense of rest, or passiveness. By various experiments it has\r\nbeen proved that the accommodation or adjustment of the eye for near\r\nobjects requires a muscular effort, but for distant objects the muscles\r\nare in an essentially passive condition. An increase in the convexity of\r\nthe crystalline lens is now admitted to be necessary for a distinct\r\nperception of near objects. We may give two simple illustrations, cited\r\nby Dr. Dalton in his recent edition of Human Physiology. If a candle be\r\nheld near the front of an eye which is directed to a distant object,\r\nthree reflected images of the flame will be seen in the eye, one on each\r\nof the anterior surfaces of the cornea and lens, and a third on the\r\nposterior surface of the latter. If the eye is directed to a near\r\nobject, the reflection on the cornea remains unchanged, while that on\r\nthe anterior surface of the lens gradually diminishes and approximates\r\nin size the reflection on the cornea, thus giving conclusive evidence\r\nthat, in viewing a near object, the anterior surface of the crystalline\r\nlens become _more convex_, and at the same time approaches the cornea.\r\nFive or six inches is the minimum limit of the muscular adjustment of\r\nthe eye. From that point to all the boundless regions of space, to every\r\nstar and nebulae which send their rays to our planet, human vision can\r\nreach. It is the sense by which we receive knowledge of the myriads of\r\nworlds and suns which circle with unfailing precision through infinite\r\nspace.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEARING.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 64.\r\nInternal and external ear. 1. External ear. 2. Internal\r\nauditory meatus. 3. Tympanum. 4. Labyrinth.\r\n5. Eustachian tube.]\r\n\r\nHearing depends upon the sonorous vibrations of the atmosphere. The\r\nwaves of sound strike the sensitive portions of the ear, and their\r\nimpressions upon the auditory nerves are termed the sensations of\r\nhearing. The ear is divided into three parts, called respectively the\r\nExternal, Middle, and Internal ear.\r\n\r\nThe external organs of hearing are two in number, and placed on opposite\r\nsides of the head. In most of the higher order of vertebrates, they are\r\nso situated as to give expression and proportion to the facial organs,\r\nand, at the same time, to suit the requirements of actual life.\r\n\r\nThe _External ear_ is connected with the interior part by a prolongation\r\nof its orifice, termed the _external auditory meatus_. In man, this\r\ngristly portion of the auditory apparatus is about one inch in length,\r\nlined by a continuation of the integument of the ear, and has numerous\r\nhairs on its surface, to prevent the intrusion of foreign substances.\r\nBetween the external MEATUS and the cavity of the middle ear is the\r\n_membrana tympani_, which is stretched across the opening like the head\r\nof a drum. The _tympanum_, or ear-drum, communicates with the pharynx by\r\nthe _eustachian tube_, which is a narrow passage lined with delicate,\r\nciliated epithelium. On the posterior portion it is connected with the\r\n_mastoid cells_. Three small bones are stretched across the cavity of\r\nthe tympanum, and called, from their form, the _malleus, incus_ and\r\n_stapes_, or the hammer, anvil, and stirrup. Agassiz mentions a fourth,\r\nwhich he terms the _os orbiculare_. Each wave of sound falling upon the\r\nmembrana tympani, throws its molecules into vibrations which are\r\ncommunicated to the chain of bones, which, in turn, transmits them to\r\nthe membrane of the _foramen ovale_. The three muscles which regulate\r\nthe tension of these membranes are termed the _tensor tympani, laxator\r\ntympani_, and _stapedium tympani._\r\n\r\nThe _Labyrinth_, or _Internal_ ear, is a complicated cavity, consisting\r\nof three portions termed the _vestibule, cochlea_, and _semi-circular\r\ncanals_. The vestibule is the central portion and communicates with the\r\nother divisions. The labyrinth is filled with a transparent fluid,\r\ntermed _perilymph_, in which are suspended, in the vestibules and\r\ncanals, small membranous sacs, containing a fluid substance, termed\r\n_endolymph_ (sometimes called _vitrine auditive_ from its resemblance to\r\nthe vitreous humor of the eye). The filaments of the auditory nerve\r\npenetrate the membranous tissues of these sacs, and also of those\r\nsuspended at the commencement of the semi-circular canals. These little\r\nsacs are supposed to be the seat of hearing, and to determine, in some\r\nmysterious way, the quality, intensity and pitch of sounds.\r\n\r\nThe determination of the _direction_ of sound is a problem of acoustics.\r\nSome have contended that the arrangement of the semi-circular canals is\r\nin some way connected with this sensation. But this supposition,\r\ntogether with the theory of the transmission of sound through the\r\nvarious portions of the cranial bones, has been exploded.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing description, it will be seen that the labyrinth and\r\ntympanum are the most essential parts of the organs of hearing. In\r\ndelicacy and refinement this sense ranks next to sight. The emotions of\r\nbeauty and sublimity, excited by the warbling of birds and the roll of\r\nthunder, are scarcely distinguishable from the intense emotions arising\r\nfrom sight. It is a remarkable fact, that the refinement or cultivation\r\nof these senses is always found associated. Those nations which furnish\r\nthe best artists, or have the highest appreciation of painting and\r\nsculpture, produce the most skillful musicians, those who reduce music\r\nto a science.\r\n\r\n\r\nSMELL.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 65.\r\n1.

Corpora striata.]\r\n\r\nNext in order of delicacy, and more closely allied with the physical\r\nfunctions, is the sense of smell. Delicate perfumes, or the fragrance of\r\na flower, impart an exhilarating sensation of delight, while numerous\r\nodors excite a feeling of disgust. The organ of smell is far less\r\ncomplicated in its structure than the eye or the ear. It consists of two\r\ncavities having cartilaginous walls, and lined with a thick mucous coat,\r\ntermed the _pituitary membrane_, over which are reflected the olfactory\r\nnerves. Particles of matter, too minute to be visible even through the\r\nmicroscope, are detached from the odorous body and come in contact with\r\nthe nerves of smell, which transmit the impressions or impulses thus\r\nreceived to the brain. Fig. 65 shows the distribution of the olfactory\r\nnerves in the nasal passages. The nose is supplied with two kinds of\r\nfilaments which are termed respectively nerves of _special_ and nerves\r\nof _general sensation_. Compared with the lower animals, especially with\r\nthose belonging to the carnivorous species, the sense of smell in man is\r\nfeeble. The sensation of smell is especially connected with the\r\npleasures and necessities of animal life.\r\n\r\n\r\nTASTE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sense of taste is directly connected with the preservation and\r\nnutrition of the body. A delicious flavor produces a desire to eat a\r\nsavory substance. Some writers on hygiene have given this sense an\r\ninstinctive character, by assuming that all articles having an agreeable\r\ntaste are suitable for diet. The nerves of taste are distributed over\r\nthe surface of the tongue and palate, and their minute extremities\r\nterminate in well developed _papillae_. These _papillae_ are divided\r\ninto three classes, termed, from their microscopic appearance,\r\n_filiform_, _fungiform_ and _circumvallate_. The organ of taste is the\r\nmucous membrane which covers the back part of the tongue and the palate.\r\nThe papillae of the tongue are large and distinct, and covered with\r\nseparate coats of epithelium. The filiform papillae are generally long\r\nand pointed and are found over the entire surface of the tongue. The\r\nfungiform are longer, small at the base and broad at the end. The\r\ncircumvallate are shaped like an inverted V and are found only near the\r\nroot of the tongue; the largest of this class of papillae have other\r\nvery small papillae upon their surfaces. It is now pretty satisfactorily\r\nestablished that the circumvallate, or fungiform papillae are the only\r\nones concerned in the special sense of taste.\r\n\r\nThe conditions necessary to taste are, that the substance be in solution\r\neither by artificial means, or by the action of the saliva; and that it\r\nbe brought in contact with the sensitive filaments imbedded in the\r\nmucous membrane. The nerves of taste are both _general_ and _special_ in\r\ntheir functions. If the general sensibility of the nerves of taste is\r\nunduly excited, the function of sensibility is lost for some time. If a\r\npeppermint lozenge is taken into the mouth, it strongly excites the\r\ngeneral sensibilities of taste, and the power of distinguishing between\r\nspecial flavors is lost for a few moments. A nauseous drug may then be\r\nswallowed without experiencing any disagreeable taste.\r\n\r\nParalysis of the facial nerve often produces a marked effect in the\r\nsensibility of the tongue. Where this influence lies has not been fully\r\nexplained; probably it is indirect, being produced by some alteration in\r\nthe vascularity of the parts or a diminution of the salivary secretions.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOUCH.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the sense of touch, we mean the _general sensibility of the skin_.\r\nSensations of heat and cold are familiar illustrations of this faculty.\r\nBy the sense of touch, we obtain a knowledge of certain qualities of a\r\nbody, such as form consistency, roughness, or smoothness of surface,\r\netc. The tip of the tongue possesses the most acute sensibility of any\r\nportion of the body, and next in order are the tips of the fingers. The\r\nhands are the principal organs of tactile sensation. The nerves of\r\ngeneral sensibility are distributed to every part of the cutaneous\r\ntissue. The contact of a foreign body with the back, will produce a\r\nsimilar _tactile_ sensation, as with the tips of the fingers. The\r\nsensation, however, will differ in _degree_ because the back is supplied\r\nwith a much smaller number of sensitive filaments; in _quality_ it is\r\nthe same.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nCEREBRAL PHYSIOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy means of the nervous system, an intimate relation is maintained\r\nbetween mind and body, for nervous energy superintends the functions of\r\nboth. The fibres of nervous matter are universally present in the\r\norganization, uniting the physical and spiritual elements of man's\r\nbeing. Even the minutest nerve-rootlets convey impressions to the dome\r\nof thought and influence the intellectual faculties. We recognize\r\n_muscular_ force, the strength of the body, _molecular_ force, molecules\r\nin motion, as heat, light, chemical force, electricity, and _nervous_\r\nforce, a certain influence which reacts between the animal functions and\r\nthe cerebrum, thus connecting the conditions of the body with those of\r\nthe mind. We cannot speak of the effects of mind or body separately, but\r\nwe must consider their action and reaction upon each other, for they are\r\nalways associated. There are many difficulties in understanding this\r\nrelationship, some of which may be obviated by a study of the\r\ndevelopment of nervous matter, and its functions in the lower orders of\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nWithin the plant-cells is found a vital, vegetable substance termed\r\nbioplasm, or protoplasm; which furnishes the same nutritive power as the\r\ntissues of the polyp and jelly fish. Many families of animals have pulpy\r\nbodies, and slight instinctive motion and sensibility, and in proportion\r\nas the nervous system is developed, both of these powers are unfolded.\r\nPlants have a low degree of sensibility, limited motion, respiratory and\r\ncirculatory organs. Animals possess quicker perceptions and\r\nsensibilities, the power of voluntary motion, and, likewise a rudimental\r\nnervous system. Some articulates have no bony skeleton, their muscles\r\nbeing attached to the skin which constitutes a soft contracting\r\nenvelope. One of the simplest forms of animal life in which a nervous\r\nsystem is found, is the five-rayed star-fish. In each ray there are\r\nfilaments which connect with similar nerve-filaments from other rays,\r\nand form a circle around the digestive cavity. It probably has no\r\nconscious perception, and its movements do not necessarily indicate\r\nsensation or volition. In some worms a rudimentary nervous system is\r\nsparingly distributed to the cavities of the thorax and abdomen, and, as\r\nin the star-fish, the largest nerve-filament is found around the\r\nesophagus, presiding over nutrition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 66.]\r\n\r\nA higher grade of organization requires a more complete arrangement of\r\nnervous substance. Stimulus applied to one organ is readily communicated\r\nto, and excites activity in another.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 67.\r\nA. Nervous system of a Crab, showing its\r\nganglia. B. The nervous system of a Caterpillar.]\r\n\r\nThe nervous system of some insects consists of two long, white cords,\r\nwhich run longitudinally through the abdomen, and are dilated at\r\nintervals into knots, consisting of collections of nerve-cells, called\r\nganglia. They are really nerve-centers, which receive and transmit\r\nimpulses, originate and impart nervous influence according to the nature\r\nof their organic surroundings. The ganglia situated over the esophagus\r\nof insects correspond to the medulla oblongata in man, in which\r\noriginate the spinal accessory, glosso-pharyngeal, and pneumogastric\r\nnerves. The latter possess double endowments, and not only participate\r\nin the operations of deglutition, digestion, circulation, and\r\nrespiration, but are also nerves of sensation and instinctive motion.\r\nThe suspension of respiration produces suffocation. In insects, these\r\nganglia are scarcely any larger than those distributed within the\r\nabdomen, with which they connect by means of minute, nervous filaments.\r\nInsects are nimble in their movements, and manifest instinct,\r\ncorresponding to the perfection of their muscular and nervous systems.\r\nWhen we ascend to vertebrates, those animals having a backbone, the\r\namount of the nervous substance is greater, the organic functions are\r\nmore complex, and the actions begin to display intelligence.\r\n\r\nMan possesses not only a complete sympathetic system, the rudiments of\r\nwhich are found in worms and insects, and a complete spinal system, less\r\nperfectly displayed in fishes, birds, and quadrupeds, but, superadded to\r\nall these is a magnificent cerebrum, and, as we have seen, all parts of\r\nthe body are connected by the nervous system. The subtle play of sensory\r\nand motor impulses, of sentient and spiritual forces, indicates a\r\nperfection of nervous endowments nowhere paralleled, and barely\r\napproached by inferior animals. This meager reference to brainless\r\nanimals, whoso knots of ganglia throughout their bodies act\r\nautomatically as little brains, shows that instinct arises\r\nsimultaneously with the development of the functions over which it\r\npresides. Here begins rudimentary, unreasoning intelligence. It\r\noriginates within the body as an inward, vital impulse, is manifested in\r\nan undeviating manner, and therefore displays no intention or\r\ndiscretion. While Dr. Carpenter likens the human organism \"to a keyed\r\ninstrument, from which any music it is capable of producing can be\r\ncalled forth at the will of the performer,\" he compares \"a bee or any\r\nother insect to a barrel organ, which plays with the greatest exactness\r\na certain number of tunes that are set upon it, but can do nothing\r\nelse.\" Instinct cannot learn from experience, or improve by practice;\r\nbut it seems to be the prophetic germ of a higher intelligence. It is\r\nnearly as difficult to draw the dividing line between instinct and a low\r\ngrade of intelligence, as it is to distinguish between the psychical and\r\npsychological[4] functions of the brain.\r\n\r\nThe intimate relation of instinct to intelligence is admirably\r\nillustrated in the working honey-bee. With forethought it selects a\r\nhabitation, constructs comb, collects honey, provides a cell for the\r\nova, covers the chrysalis, for which it deposits special nourishment,\r\nand is disposed to defend its possessions. It is a social insect, lives\r\nin colonies, chastises trespassers, fights its enemies, and defends its\r\nhome. It manifests a degree of intelligence, but its sagacity is\r\ninstinctive. Reason, though not so acute as instinct, becomes, by\r\neducation, discerning and keenly penetrative, and reveals the very\r\nsecrets of profound thought. We recall the aptness of Prof. Agassiz's\r\nremark: _\"There is even a certain antagonism between instinct and\r\nintelligence, so that instinct loses its force and peculiar\r\ncharacteristics, whenever intelligence becomes developed.\"_ Animals\r\nhaving larger reasoning powers manifest less instinct, and some, as the\r\nleopard, exercise both in a limited degree. This double endowment with\r\ninstinct and low reasoning intelligence, is indicated by his lying in\r\nambush awaiting his prey, the hiding-place being selected near the haunt\r\nof other animals, where nature offers some allurement to gratify the\r\nappetite.\r\n\r\nSimple reflex action is an instinctive expression, manifesting an\r\nintuitive perception, almost intelligent, as shown by the contraction of\r\nthe stomach upon the food, simply because it impinges upon the inner\r\ncoats, and thus excites them to action. A better illustration, because\r\nit displays sympathy, is when the skin, disabled by cold, cannot act,\r\nand its duties are largely performed by the kidneys. Though reflex\r\naction is easily traced in the lower organic processes, some writers\r\nhave placed it on a level with rational deliberation. Undoubtedly, all\r\nanimals having perception have also what perception\r\nimplies--consciousness--and this indicates the possession, in some\r\ndegree, of reason. _Compound_ reflex action extends into the domain of\r\nthought. _Simple_ reflex action, or instinct, answers to the animal\r\nfaculties, such as acquisitiveness, secretiveness, selfishness,\r\nreproductiveness, etc., and accomplishes two important purposes;\r\nself-preservation and the reproduction of the specie. With many persons,\r\nthese appear to be the chief ends of life!\r\n\r\nThe psychical functions connect, not only with animal propensities, but\r\nalso with the highest psychological faculties. Instinct is the\r\nrepresentative of animal conditions, just as the highest spiritual\r\nfaculties are indicative of qualities and principles. The consistent\r\nmean of conduct is an equilibrium between these ultimate tendencies of\r\nour being. The psychological functions render the animal nature\r\nsubservient to the rule of purity and holiness, and deeply influence it\r\nby the essential elements of spiritual existence. The psychical organs\r\nsustain an intermediate relation, receiving the impressions of the\r\nbodily propensities, and, likewise, of the highest emotions. Obviously,\r\nthese extreme influences, the one growing out of animal conditions, the\r\nother, the result of spiritual relations, pass into the psychical medium\r\nand are refracted by it, or made equivalent to one force. The body\r\nrequires the qualifying influences of mind. The tendencies of the animal\r\nfaculties are selfish and limiting, those of the emotive, general,\r\nuniversal. The propensities, like gravity, expend their force upon\r\nmatter; the emotions pour forth torrents of feeling, and produce\r\nrhapsodies of sentiment. The propensities naturally restrict their\r\nexpression to a specific object of sense; the emotions respond to\r\nimmaterial being. The tendencies of the former are acquisitive, selfish,\r\ngratifying; of the latter, bestowing, expanding, diffusing. The one\r\nclass is restricted to the orbits of time and matter, the other flows on\r\nthrough the limitless cycles of infinity and immortality. The former is\r\nsatiated in animal gratification, the latter in spiritual beatification.\r\nThe one culminates in animal enjoyment, the other expands to its\r\nultimate conceptions in the perfections of Divine Love.\r\n\r\nIn the present life, mind and body are intimately connected by nervous\r\nmatter. In this dual constitution, the spiritual mental, and animal\r\nfunctions are made inseparable, and modify one another. The ultimate\r\ntendencies of each extreme exist, not absolutely for themselves, but for\r\nqualifying purposes, to establish a basis for the deeper economy of\r\nlife. By the employment of reason, animal and spiritual experiences are\r\nmutually benefited, and the consciousness rendered accountable. The\r\nbodily and mental workings are in many senses one, and help to interpret\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nEvery fact of mind has many aspects. A brain force, which results in\r\nthought, is simultaneously a physiological force, if it influences the\r\nbodily functions. Likewise, spiritual conceptions take their rise in the\r\nsame blood that feeds the grosser tissues. This vital fluid is\r\nmomentarily imparting and receiving elements from all the bodily organs,\r\nand these, in turn, must influence the process of thought, and, in a\r\ndegree, determine its quality. The delicate outline, yea, even the\r\nsubstance of an idea, may depend upon the condition of the animal\r\norgans. Thought is subject to the laws of biology, and, therefore, is a\r\nsymbol of health. Morbid conditions of the system hang out their signs\r\nin words and utterances. Words which express fear are as true symptoms\r\nof functional difficulty as is excessive palpitation. The organ\r\nrepresenting fear sustains a special relation to the functions of the\r\nheart both in health and disease. Bright hopes characterize pulmonary\r\ncomplaints as certainly as cough. Exquisite susceptibility of mind\r\nindicates equally extreme sensibility of body, and those persons capable\r\nof fully expressing the highest emotions are especially susceptible to\r\nbodily sensations. Tears are physical emblems of grief, and\r\nfellow-feeling calls forth sympathetic tears. Excessive anxiety of mind\r\nproduces general excitability of body, which soon results in chronic\r\ndisease. Pleasurable emotions stimulate the processes of nutrition, and\r\nare restorative. This concomitance of mental and bodily states is very\r\nremarkable. Joy and Love, as well as jealousy and anger, flash in the\r\neye and mould the features to their expression. Grief excites the\r\nlachrymal, and rage the salivary glands. Shame reddens the ears, drops\r\nthe eyelids, and flushes the face; but profligacy destroys these\r\nexpressions. The blush which suffuses the forehead of the bashful maiden\r\nbetrays her love, and _maternal_ love, stirred by the appeals of an\r\nidolized infant, excites the mammary gland to the secretion of milk. The\r\nsigh of melancholia indicates hepatic torpor, thus showing a special\r\nrelation between the liver and respiratory organs. These conditions of\r\nmind and body react upon one another. Even the thought of a luscious\r\npeach may cause the mouth to water. The thought of tasting a lemon fills\r\nthe mouth with secretions, and a story with unsavory associations may\r\ncompletely turn the stomach.\r\n\r\nThe relationship of mental and physical functions may be illustrated by\r\nentirely removing the spleen of an animal, as that of a dog. An\r\ninvariable result of its extirpation is an unusual increase of the\r\nappetite, for at times the animal will eat voraciously any kind of food.\r\nThe dog will devour, with avidity, the warm entrails of recently killed\r\nanimals, and thrive in consequence of such an appetite. Another symptom,\r\nwhich usually follows the removal of the spleen, is an unnatural\r\nferocity of disposition. Without any apparent provocation, the animal\r\nwill attack others of its own, or of a different species. In some\r\ninstances, these outbursts of irritability and violence are only\r\noccasional, but the experiments show quite conclusively that the spleen\r\nmoderates combativeness, restrains the appetite, and co-operates with\r\nthe will and judgment in controlling them.\r\n\r\nWe shall briefly consider the practical question whether the elements of\r\nmind can be ideally arranged and presented, so as to more completely\r\nreveal their relations to, and disclose their effects upon the bodily\r\nfunctions. Modern philosophers conceive that mind consists of a triad of\r\nessentials; _Intellect, Emotion,_ and _Volition_. Physiologists assign\r\nto the cerebrum its functions, and neurological, as well as\r\nphrenological writers, have located them as represented in Fig. 68.\r\nTrue, there is no structural division between the parts of the cerebrum\r\nto indicate this diversity of function, nor is there any perceptible\r\nlimit between the sensory and motor filaments of the game nerve. As no\r\none has any reason for denying that separate portions of the brain may\r\nmanifest distinct functions of the mind, we shall assume it as a\r\nconceded proposition. The regions of the cerebrum, thus ideally\r\nrepresented, occupy but little more than half of the arc of a circle,\r\nwhereas it is evident that the base of the nervous mass is not idle, and\r\nis equally entitled to our consideration. In the posterior chamber of\r\nthe skull is the cerebellum, anterior to, and below which, is the\r\nmedulla oblongata, connecting with the spinal cord and sympathetic\r\nsystem. These various parts are essential to the harmonious blending of\r\nmind and body. To this end, two conditions are necessary. (1.) All the\r\nnervous forces must be so related that action and reaction may be fully\r\nestablished. (2.) A complete nervous circuit is requisite for the\r\nreciprocal influence of mind and body.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 68.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 69. ]\r\n\r\nNature answers to mind in physical correspondences. The planetary system\r\nis fashioned after a circle. Life itself springs from a spherule of\r\nforces. The perfection of an idea, or the completeness of a conception\r\nmay be expressed by a circle. The elements of Science, Astronomy,\r\nGeology, and Natural History, are pictorially represented in this\r\nmanner. How appropriately and logically can a fragment of natural\r\nhistory, this epitome of all nature and science--_the mind_--be\r\nillustrated by a simple circle! Every element must act and react, and be\r\nequal and opposite. Thus may the existence of the opposing energies and\r\nfunctions of each faculty be equally represented. The contrast aids us\r\nin understanding their ultimate tendencies, and enables us to correctly\r\nvalue and define their nature. Faculties of kindred qualities may be\r\ngrouped together, and their antagonisms represented in the opposite arc\r\nof the circle. Let us employ a circle to represent mind. The conception\r\nof the abstract quality of _good_, requires contrast with one of a\r\nconverse nature, _bad_, (see Fig. 69). Opposite faculties may be\r\nportrayed in the same manner. The functions of the cerebrum and spinal\r\nsystem may be symbolically represented as those of the highest and\r\nlowest organs, thus giving rise to the positive and negative extremes of\r\nfeeling. The writer conceives of no other way in which the widely\r\ncontrasted facts of human experience can be so perfectly symbolized.\r\n_Good_ (Fig. 69) may represent moral faculties, and _bad_, their\r\nopposites. Undoubtedly, nature is not so arbitrary in her arrangements\r\nas we are in shadowing forth our imperfect conceptions, yet is not this\r\na decided improvement in determining cerebral faculties and their\r\nrelations? We observe how scholars and philosophers confound the noblest\r\nand most exalted emotions with the animal propensities instead of\r\ndistinguishing between them. \"_The emotions are a department of the\r\nfeelings, formed by the intervention of intellectual processes. Several\r\nof them are so characteristic that they can be known only by individual\r\nexperiences; as Wonder, Fear, Love, Anger_.\" See Logic: Deductive and\r\nInductive, by Alexander Bain, LL. D., page 508, (1874).\r\n\r\nThis is not an exceptional, but a common example of classifying Love,\r\nthe highest and purest of the emotions, with Anger, an animal\r\npropensity. Is it not more practical and philosophical to group the\r\nemotional faculties together, and upon an opposite arc represent their\r\nantagonistic energies, the ultimate tendencies of which are criminal?\r\nBoth groups are mutually modifying and restraining; the one relates\r\ninstinctively to the bodily wants, the other to the requirements of\r\nmind, and each is essential to a consistent life. Accordingly, we deem\r\nit philosophical to consider words as symbols of mental faculties, and\r\nto classify together such spiritual unities as joy, hope, faith, and\r\nlove, the tendencies of which are to quicken and transform the ultimates\r\nof carnal life into the rudiments of an immortal one, the beginning of\r\nheaven on earth. These restrain those opposites, which lead to crime and\r\ndeath. Love and Hate are as antagonistic as heat and cold, and the\r\nusefulness of both depends upon their _proper_ temperament. Fig. 70\r\nrepresents the antagonism of the Intellectual faculties to the Animal,\r\nthe Emotional to the Criminal, the Volitive to the Enfeebling. It is not\r\nessential to discover in the nerve-substance the precise power from\r\nwhich an impulse originates. We may reasonably interpret the functions\r\nof the brain, and yet be unable to disclose the duties of any ganglionic\r\ncorpuscle composing it. We may foretell what each season of the year\r\nwill bring forth, when we cannot forecast the history of a blade of\r\ngrass or a single grain of any kind. We may predict the amount of rain\r\nfor a month, and be unable to prognosticate correctly, the character of\r\nany storm, or give the history of a special drop of water. Although we\r\ncannot follow the movements of individuals in a battle, yet we may\r\npredict the result of the combat; and thus, we judge of the functions of\r\nthe brain without the ability to reveal the actions of one of the\r\norganic molecules of which it is composed. We aim to give a general,\r\nreasonable, and popular description of cerebral functions and their\r\nbearing upon health and disease.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 70.]\r\n\r\n\r\nREGIONAL DIVISIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 71.]\r\n\r\nThe anterior portion of the cerebrum is devoted to intellectual\r\nprocesses, which freely expend the vital energies. The Intellectual\r\nfaculties are classified as represented in Fig. 71. The lower portion of\r\nthe brain, bounded exteriorly by the superciliary ridge, corresponds to\r\nthe Perceptive, the middle region to the Recollective, and the upper to\r\nthe Reflective faculties. (See also Fig. 65, _b_.) If we divide the\r\nforehead by vertical lines, as shown in Fig. 71, the divisions thus\r\nformed represent respectively, the Active, Deliberative, and\r\nContemplative departments of the intellect, all the processes of which\r\nare sustained by vital changes, the transformation of organized\r\nmaterials. No mental effort can be made without waste of nervous matter.\r\nThe gardener's hoe wears by use, and so does every part of the animal\r\norganism. Otherwise, nutrition would be unnecessary for the adult. The\r\nproduction of thought wears away the cerebral substance. In ordinary\r\nuse, the brain requires one-fifth of the blood to support its growth and\r\nrepair. Great mental efforts are attended by a corresponding expenditure\r\nof vital treasures, which are abstracted from the total forces available\r\nfor the necessities of the system. To repair the losses thus occasioned,\r\nmaterials are appropriated from the blood, which furnishes supplies in\r\nproportion to the demands made by the mental activities. The production\r\nof thought wears away the gray matter of the cerebrum as surely as the\r\ndigging of a canal wears away the iron particles of the spade. The brain\r\nwould soon wear out did not the nutritive functions constantly make good\r\nthe waste. The intellect, whether engaged in observation,\r\ngeneralization, or profound study consumes the brain and blood, hence\r\nintellectual activity implies VITAL EXPENDITURE. _Expenditure_ is an\r\nemphatic word because all functions are essential to the production of\r\nthis nerve-energy, which returns to the system no equivalent. Physical\r\nexercise, although attended by structural waste, is advantageous to the\r\ncirculation of the blood, nutrition, secretion, and, in fact, beneficial\r\nto all the organic processes. This is not true of vigorous and prolonged\r\nmental labor, which is not attended by any of these incidental\r\nadvantages. If a child attends a school in which mental development\r\nsupersedes physical culture, an inordinate ambition sways the youthful\r\nmind, and its baneful effects upon the health soon become manifest.\r\nRigorous application of the intellectual faculties consumes the blood,\r\nexhausts the vital forces, weakens the organic functions, while pallor\r\ncovers the face, and the eyes sparkle with a hectic radiance. The family\r\nphysician pronounces the condition _Anæmia_ (a deficiency of red\r\ncorpuscles in the blood), and this change in the quality of the blood is\r\nowing to the undue appropriation by the brain. Conversely, if the blood\r\nbe destroyed, or its vitality reduced, in the same proportion will the\r\nmental energies be weakened and all the functional powers of the\r\nphysical system enfeebled. In brief, if the intellect be unduly\r\nexercised, the red corpuscles of the sanguine fluid will be gradually\r\ndestroyed, and the serum allowed to predominate. The blood becomes weak\r\nand watery, the subject is nervous, dropsical, consumptive and\r\nderangement of the important functions follows almost invariably.\r\nExcessive intellectual activity often produces weak state of the system,\r\nand the person thus affected becomes languid, spiritless, and an easy\r\nprey to disease. This mental cause and its bodily results may be\r\nclassified in the following order. Mental Cause: EXCESSIVE MENTAL\r\nEXERTION, which produces _waste of the brain substance and blood_.\r\n\r\n                     / VITAL EXPENDITURE,\r\n    Bodily results:  { ANÆMIA,\r\n                     \\ A WEAK CONDITION.\r\n\r\nThis kind of waste is best summed up in the words, VITAL EXPENDITURE.\r\nUpon the forehead, as represented in Fig. 72, we will therefore inscribe\r\nINTELLECT, ACTIVITY, and VITAL EXPENDITURE. Intellectual employment is\r\nusually accompanied by sedentary habits, neglect of healthful exercise,\r\nand a deprivation of pure air, to all of which ill health may be\r\nattributed. Were the intellectual expenditure arrested, and the forces\r\nturned into recuperative channels, many a person would become beautiful\r\nwith the ruddy glow of health. Without health there is no use for\r\nthought; cultivation of the mind is just as natural and essential as the\r\nculture of the body, and the trained development of both is needed for\r\nmutual improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\nEMOTIVE FACULTIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 72.]\r\n\r\nWhat results follow the _natural_ and the _excessive_ exercise of the\r\nEMOTIVE FACULTIES? AS distinct organs of the body have diverse\r\nfunctions, so, in like manner, different parts of the brain perform the\r\nseparate operations of the mind. It is easier to discriminate between\r\nthe products of these dissimilar endowments than to determine the\r\nlocation of the faculties. The intellect deals with concrete subjects,\r\nand the emotions with abstractions; the intellect is exercised with\r\nmaterial things, the emotions dwell upon attributes; the intellect\r\nconsiders the forces of matter, the emotions, the powers of the soul;\r\nthe former deliberates upon the truths of science, the latter is\r\nconcerned with duties, obligations, or moral responsibilities; the first\r\nis satisfied only with new truths, original ideas, and rational changes,\r\nthe last rest securely on fundamental principles, moral certainties, and\r\nthe absolute constancy of perfect love. The intellectual faculties are\r\nwakeful, questioning, mistrustful; the emotions are blind, hopeful,\r\nconfiding; the one reasoning, exacting, demonstrating; the other,\r\nbelieving, inspiring, devout. The intellect sees, the emotions feel;\r\nand, though these functions may blend, the one can never supersede the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe quality of the emotional faculties is represented by Benevolence,\r\nSympathy, Joy, Hope, Confidence, Gratitude, Love, and Devotion, all of\r\nwhich are the very antitheses of the attributes of animal feeling,\r\ndescribed as Melancholy, Fear, Anger, Hate, Malevolence, and Despair. To\r\nthe emotions we refer the highest qualities of character, while their\r\nopposites represent the animal or baser impulses. True, the emotions\r\nmodify the propensities, as sympathy softens grief. They may subdue and\r\nrefine the animal feelings, and thus veil them with a delicacy\r\ncharacteristic of their own purity; but the unrestrained influences of\r\ngrief find vent in loud lamentations, and the bitter disappointments of\r\nthe selfish faculties are passionate and violent.\r\n\r\nThe _Emotive Faculties_--the organs of spiritual perceptions--are\r\nimpersonal, outflowing, bestowing. The function represented by\r\nBenevolence, is willing, giving. Devotion expresses dedication,\r\nconsecration; Gratitude manifests a warm and friendly feeling toward a\r\nbenefactor.\r\n\r\n    \"The depth immense of endless gratitude.\"--MILTON.\r\n\r\nLove flames toward its object, is out-pouring, blessing; indeed, all the\r\nemotions are gushing, effusive, impetuous, and profusely flowing; grand,\r\ntorrent-like, overwhelming; employing ideal, immaterial, spiritual\r\nexpressions, developing principles and perfections while aspiring to\r\nhappiness and immortality. Though beginning with humanity, they embody\r\nthe Divine. They expand to their ultimate conceptions in the sublime\r\nattributes: the perfections of the God of Love; associating with\r\nmortality a divine destiny commencing on earth, extending through time,\r\npausing not at the portals of death, the gateway to eternity, but\r\nflowing onward into the realms of eternal day.\r\n\r\nWe may consider their counteracting influences, for, without doubt, by\r\nchecking the selfish tendencies and restraining the animal propensities,\r\nthey assist in controlling the sensual passions, and thus balance the\r\nmind and body. Such an equilibrium we call _happiness_. If the emotions\r\nbe acute and vehement, they will absorb all other impressions and revel\r\nin their culminating and delightful experiences. They exhaust all the\r\nbodily energies, and a functional suspension, termed _ecstasy_, follows.\r\nIt is a swooning, or fainting, a temporary loss of sensation and\r\nvolition, accompanied by involuntary movements of the arms, smiting of\r\nthe hands, sighing, and short ejaculatory expressions of rapture. This\r\ncondition, occasioned by excessive emotion, as in praying, singing,\r\nexhortations, and sympathetic appeals, is contagious, often spreading\r\nwith mysterious rapidity. Its culmination, ecstasy, is popularly termed\r\n\"_the power_.\" When gradually induced, it is called _trance_, and each\r\nstate is regarded by many as supernatural, caused by the immediate\r\ninfluence of the Holy Spirit. The explanation is this: when the emotive\r\nfaculties are suddenly and powerfully excited, they quickly expend the\r\norganic forces, so that the individual swoons from sheer exhaustion.\r\nUndue expenditure of this class of brain functions not only consumes the\r\nbodily powers, but exhausts and prevents other mental operations. The\r\nsudden collapse of all voluntary functions resembles the fainting\r\nproduced by blood-letting. We may sum up this rapid expenditure of\r\nenergy in one expressive word, EXHAUSTION, which results in _Ecstasy_,\r\nor trance, and which, if carried a degree further, terminates in death.\r\nBeginning with the natural exercise of the emotions, we may state the\r\norder of sequences thus:\r\n\r\n    Ordinary exercise leads to   CALMNESS.\r\n    Proper exercise     \"   \"    HAPPINESS.\r\n    Increased exercise  \"   \"    ECSTASY.\r\n    Excessive exercise  \"   \"    SYNCOPE.\r\n    Prolonged exercise  \"   \"    TRANCE.\r\n    Fatal exercise      \"   \"    MORTALITY.\r\n    Their tendencies are         EXHAUSTIVE.\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLITIVE FACULTIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are the physiological and morbid results attending the ordinary and\r\nthe immoderate exercise of the VOLITIVE FACULTIES?\r\n\r\nThe generic term _will_, comprehends those faculties, the action of\r\nwhich is termed _volition_. The faculties of the will are Determination,\r\nFirmness, Decision, Ambition, Authority, and Vigilance, all of which\r\nindicate strength and continuity of purpose. Bordering upon the emotions\r\nare Patience and Perseverance, while adjoining the animal faculties are\r\nPower, Coarseness, and Love of Display. The former exhibit moral, the\r\nlatter animal heroism. A sense of power urges forward, whether it be\r\nhigher or lower, just as the sense of greatness makes a man _great_ by\r\ninspiring him with confidence to put forth exertion. Nature is truthful\r\nin her aspirations. We know that courage, assurance, and conscious power\r\nare necessary for the fulfillment of purpose, because intention precedes\r\naction. Will-power is an indication of HEALTH, and the constant exercise\r\nof these mental faculties exerts a steady, regular, and strengthening\r\ninfluence over the bodily functions. We translate mental energies into\r\nphysiological industry. These faculties impart tone to the system,\r\nsustain the processes of nutrition, circulation, assimilation, secretion\r\nand excretion, and their distinguishing characteristics are vigor,\r\ntension, and elasticity. They temper each element of character, as well\r\nas every vital act. They infuse the organism with a resisting power\r\nwhich renders it proof against the influence of miasma and malaria, and\r\novercomes that passivity and impressionability so favorable to disease.\r\nFirmness expresses a physiological cohesiveness which strongly binds\r\ntogether the fibers of the tissues, and renders the organization compact\r\nand powerful. He, who can skillfully employ these energies, is already\r\nmaster of half of the diseases incident to mankind, and wields an\r\nindispensable adjunct to medicine, in the practice of the healing art.\r\nIt is the key to success, for it unlocks difficulties and opens wide the\r\ndoor which leads to favorable results.\r\n\r\nSurplus energy sustains the circulation, increases capillary action, as\r\nif the excess of nerve-power were discharged from the distant extremity\r\nof each nerve and pervaded every tissue. The voluntary muscles indicate\r\ntheir participation in this energy, and, indeed, the whole organism is\r\nexalted by the influence of the mental faculties. They oppose the\r\ntendencies of Feebleness, Relaxation, and Derangement, and modify their\r\nproclivities to Disease. The will is the servant of the intellect,\r\nemotions, and propensities, and the executive agent of all the\r\nfaculties. When the volitive faculties are in excess, they may overdo\r\nthe other functions, prematurely break down the bodily organs, and, by\r\novertaxing the system, subject it to pain and disorder.\r\n\r\n_VOLITIVE FACULTIES._\r\n\r\nThe natural effect of FIRMNESS is physiological stability. The exercise\r\nof the volitive faculties displays both mental and bodily ENERGY.\r\n\r\n                            / TEMPERANCE,\r\n    Their tendencies are to { SANITY,\r\n                            \\ HEALTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nANIMAL FACULTIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 73. is a representation of the cranial conformation\r\nof Alexander VI., exhibiting a full development of the conservative\r\nfaculties. His character, according to history, brought reproach upon\r\nthe papal chair.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 74. represents Zeno, a profound thinker and moral\r\nphilosopher. The contrast in their cranial developments was no greater\r\nthan that of their lives.]\r\n\r\nUnder this generic term we will group those cerebral powers which are\r\ncommon to the inferior animals, and closely allied to bodily conditions\r\nand necessities. As denoting a group of animal faculties they relate not\r\nonly to the organic functions and self-preservation, but combat the\r\naction of the intellect, oppose the evolution of new ideas, resist\r\ninvestigation, and discredit the value of truth. Adhesiveness, being\r\nblindly conservative, clings to old ideas and traditionary opinions. The\r\nanimal faculties tend to stifle investigation, and put authority above\r\ntruth and science. Having a fixity of nature, a stationary attachment,\r\nthey treat all intellectual developments as absurd. When these faculties\r\npredominate, thought is obscured, intolerance of disposition is\r\nmanifested, and mental progress is arrested. Thus they evince their\r\nconservative nature, and, since they relate to individual interests,\r\nthey represent the elements of instinct. Such are the functions of\r\nAcquisitiveness, Secretiveness, Selfishness, and Combativeness, as well\r\nas the Generative powers. If these faculties predominate, all\r\nintellectual advancements are treated as experiments or theoretical\r\nnovelties, and rejected as evanescent and worthless. If the promptings\r\nof these be followed, there will be no innovation, and the orthodoxy of\r\nthe dark ages will remain the standard for all time. The animal\r\nfaculties coincide with Lethargy, Sleep, and Nutrition, thus favoring\r\norganic restoration. The intellectual faculties are wakeful, active,\r\nirrepressible, while the animal powers tend to repose, sleep, and\r\nrenovation, and thus suspend the activities of thought, sense, and\r\nmotion. The intellect expends the energy of the sensorial centers,\r\ninduces fatigue and suffering, whereas the animal faculties overcome the\r\nvigils of thought, and produce refreshing slumber. Dr. Young styles\r\nsleep \"tired nature's sweet restorer.\" Swedenborg declared that, \"in\r\nsleep the brain folded itself up, and the soul journeyed through the\r\nbody, repairing the wastes of the previous day.\" When sleep is natural,\r\nthe insane are in a fair way to recovery, the sick become convalescent,\r\nulcers granulate, and lesions are made whole.\r\n\r\nThe animal faculties are skeptical, stubborn, and dogmatic, readily\r\ncombining with those of the violent class, the ultimate tendencies of\r\nwhich are criminal. They are likewise conceited, assuming, and clannish.\r\nAny person distinguished by them, will cling to old associations,\r\nperpetuate the status of existing parties, be a stickler for creed,\r\nceremonies, and stale opinions, and adhere to ancient orthodoxy in\r\nmedicine and religion. The animal faculties, since they are staid and\r\nregular, are naturally antagonistic to genius, sensibility, and\r\noriginality. Their mental tendencies have been fairly described and\r\ntheir physiological results may be represented as follows:\r\n\r\n                                 / RESTRAINT,\r\n                                 / SLEEP,\r\n    The animal faculties produce { NUTRITION,\r\n                                 \\ RESTORATION,\r\n                                 \\ CONSERVATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nBASILAR FACULTIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ultimate tendencies of the faculties, represented by the posterior\r\nbase of the cerebrum, are violent and criminal. Being contiguous to the\r\njunction of the cerebrum and spinal system, they are subject to the\r\ninfluence of animal experiences. A large development of these faculties\r\nis indicated by an unusual breadth and depth of the back part of the\r\nbase of the brain, and a full, thick neck, both of which denote good\r\nalimentary and digestive powers. Active nutrition, plethora of the\r\ncirculation, vigorous secretion, a well developed muscular system, a\r\nlarge heart and lungs, are accessory conditions. We do not associate\r\ncorpulence or surplus of vitality with a long, slender neck. The\r\ncharacter of cerebral manifestations is represented by the baser\r\nfaculties of mind, such as Combativeness, Destructiveness, Desperation,\r\nTurbulence, Hatred, and Revenge. If unrestrained, these culminate in\r\nviolent and criminal acts; if _regulated_, they are employed in personal\r\ndefense. When _unduly excited_, they lead to dissipation, obscenity,\r\nswearing, rowdyism, and licentiousness; when _perverted_, they are the\r\nsource of recklessness, quarrels, frauds, falsehoods, robberies, and\r\nhomicides. They are unlike instinct, inasmuch as they are not\r\nself-limiting. The intimate relation which they sustain to the stomach\r\nand nutritive functions is strikingly displayed in the habit of\r\nalcoholic intoxication. Spirituous drinks deprave the appetite, derange\r\nand destroy the stomach, poison the blood, and pervert all the functions\r\nof mind and body; and their injurious influence upon the nerves and\r\nbasilar faculties is equally remarkable. They excite combativeness,\r\nselfishness, irritability, and exaggerate the influence of the animal\r\norgans. Intemperance results in disputes, fights, brawls, and\r\nmurders--the legitimate consequences of which are misunderstandings,\r\nsuits at law, criminal proceedings, imprisonment, and the gallows. It\r\nis, therefore, evident that the ultimate tendencies of these faculties\r\nare tyrannical, cruel, violent, and atrocious. They are opposed to the\r\nnoble, moral faculties--Faith, Love, and Devotion--and, whenever\r\ntemptation inordinately allures, the course of life is likely to be\r\ncharacterized by dishonorable, deceptive, and treacherous conduct.\r\n\r\nThe pangs of hunger cause soldiers to act more like ravenous beasts,\r\nthan rational beings. It is animal instinct which impels the soldier to\r\nseek first for the gratification of his appetite. Some persons,\r\ninstigated by carnivorous desires, yearn for raw meat, and will not be\r\nsatisfied unless their food is flavored with the flesh of animals. Their\r\nbodies increase and thrive, even to repletion. Contrast these\r\nindividuals with pale, lean, anæmic people, who crave innutritious\r\narticles of diet, and eat soft stones, slate, chalk, blue clay, and soft\r\ncoal. Such perversions of the appetite are manifested only when there is\r\neither a diminution in the volume of blood, deficient alimentation,\r\ndefective assimilation, or a general depravity of the nutritive\r\nfunctions. Morbid conditions generate vitiating tendencies and destroy\r\nthe natural appetite.\r\n\r\nWhile alcoholic stimulants affect the medulla oblongata principally,\r\nopium acts chiefly on the cerebrum, and excites reverie, dreamy\r\nideality, optical delusions, and the creative powers of the imagination;\r\nsome of these hallucinations are said to be grotesquely beautiful and\r\nenjoyable. The effects of this agent differ from those of alcoholic\r\nintoxication by not deadening the moral sensibilities, or arousing the\r\nanimal propensities. Opium smokers are dreamy and abstracted, not\r\nquarrelsome or violent. Those who use ardent spirits lose their moral\r\ndelicacy, their intellect becomes dull, the reason cloudy, and the\r\njudgment is overruled by appetite. It is conceded that the _trophic\r\ncenter_ is principally in the medulla oblongata; the cerebellum and\r\nlower cerebral ganglia, however, favorably influence the nutritive\r\nfunctions, and, when these organs are large and active, a plethoric\r\ncondition is the natural consequence. Redundancy of blood in the body\r\nindicates preponderance of the basilar organs. These faculties being\r\nvehement in character, an excess of animal characteristics produces\r\nthose conditions which result in acute and inflammatory diseases. We may\r\nexpress these conditions of the system as follows:\r\n\r\nThe _Animal Faculties_ correspond to the lower instinctive\r\nmanifestations.\r\n\r\n                                  / ACQUISITIVENESS,\r\n    The elements of character are { SELFISHNESS,\r\n                                  \\ COMBATIVENESS\r\n\r\n    They tend to                  / TURBULENCE,\r\n                                  \\ CRIME.\r\n\r\n                                  / ALIMENTATION,\r\n    They relate especially to the { SECRETION,\r\n      functions of                \\ NUTRITION,\r\n                                  \\ REPRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n                                  / VITALITY,\r\n    A large development of them   { PLETHORA,\r\n      indicates                   \\ HYPERAEMIA (congestion).\r\n\r\nThese naturally give rise to the following diseases: Inflammation,\r\nRheumatism, Gout, Convulsions, etc., which, in these conditions, pursue\r\na violent course.\r\n\r\n\r\nREGION OF FEEBLENESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the middle lobe of the cerebrum, at the base of the brain, does\r\nnot denote decided force of character, or energy of constitution, yet it\r\nhas a certain sphere of normal action which is essential to the harmony\r\nof mind and body. If this region is largely developed, the constitution\r\nis languid, inefficient, sensitive, and abnormally disposed. But if it\r\nbe deficient, the volitive energies preponderate, and there is a lack of\r\nthose susceptibilities of constitution, which prevent excessive waste.\r\nThe cerebral faculties are Fear, Anxiety, Sensibility, Servility,\r\nRelaxation, and Melancholy, and their excessive predominance indicates a\r\nweak, vacillating, irresolute character, and the existence of those\r\nbodily conditions which produce _general excitability_ and chronic\r\nderangement. A full development of this portion of the brain indicates\r\nthat the person is naturally dependent, inferior, and subservient to\r\nstronger characters. Such a one is fearful, fretful, complaining,\r\nirritable, dejected, morose, and, sooner or later, becomes a fit subject\r\nfor chronic disease.[5] The ultimate result of excessive fear,\r\nexcitability, and irritability, is functional or organic\r\nderangement,--the morbid conditions represented by the word Disease. The\r\nmedulla oblongata and portions of the middle lobe of the brain, the\r\nfunctions of which represent Excitability, Anxiety, Fear, and\r\nIrritability (symbols of physical profligacy), are located just between\r\nthe ears (see Fig. 60). Inferior animals distinguished for breadth\r\nbetween the ears are not only cunning and treacherous, but very\r\nexcitable and irritable. The head of the Fox is remarkable for its\r\nextreme width at the region of Fear. He is proverbially crafty and\r\ntreacherous, always excitable, and so variable in temper that he can\r\nnever be trusted. He is a very timid thief, exceedingly suspicious,\r\nirregular in habits, and frequently driven by hunger into mischievous\r\ndepredations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 75.\r\nSly Reynard]\r\n\r\nThe organ of alimentiveness, located directly in front of the ear,\r\nindicates the functional conditions of the stomach, which, when aroused\r\nby excessive hunger, exerts a debasing influence upon this and all of\r\nthe adjacent organs, and is demoralizing to both body and mind. In\r\nobedience to the instinct of hunger, children will slyly plunder gardens\r\nand orchards, displaying profligate, if not reckless tendencies in the\r\ngratification of the appetite. In this regional division we include the\r\nmedulla, the posterior and middle portions of which give rise to the\r\npneumogastric nerve. This nerve receives branches from the spinal\r\naccessory, facial, hypoglossal, and the anterior trunks of the first and\r\nsecond cervical, and its filaments are distributed to the lungs,\r\nstomach, liver, spleen, pancreas, and gall bladder (see Fig. 60, with\r\nexplanation) Its agency is necessary to maintain the circulation, and\r\nthe respiration, since, as the medium of communication, it conveys from\r\nthe brain large supplies of nervous force to sustain these vital\r\nfunctions. It likewise instantly reports the impressions of these\r\nphysiological processes to the brain, and especially to those parts\r\nwhich, by analogy of functions. It likewise instantly reports the\r\nimpressions of these physiological processes of the brain, and\r\nespecially to those parts which, by analogy of functions, are intimately\r\nrelated to the stomach. Hence, we observe that the conditions of the\r\nstomach give rise to reflex impulses, which involuntarily excite the\r\nanimal faculties to the gratification of the appetite. That the stomach\r\nhas an intimate connection with the rest of the organism is evident from\r\nthe fact that when it is inflamed the body is completely prostrated.\r\n\r\nWe have already alluded to the perverting tendencies of alcoholic\r\nstimulants. Their peculiar influence upon the cerebellum causes the\r\nsubject to reel and stagger, as though a portion of that organ were\r\nremoved; the group of energetic faculties is stupefied, and mental as\r\nwell as corporeal lethargy is the result. The reaction, which inevitably\r\nfollows, is almost unbearable, and relief is sought by repeating and\r\nincreasing the poisonous draughts, the primary influence of which is\r\nstimulating, the ulterior, depressing. Alcoholic stimulants unduly\r\nexcite the nervous centers, the heart, and the arteries, and,\r\nconsequently, the blood is carried to the surface of the body, where it\r\ncounteracts the influence of cold and exposure, the frequent attendants\r\nupon drunkenness. The use of alcoholic beverages perverts the appetite,\r\ninterrupts habits of industry and destroys all force of character.\r\nPecuniary, physical, and mental ruin, therefore, are sure to follow as\r\nthe consequences of habitual, alcoholic intoxication.\r\n\r\nThat ordinary alimentation, which includes the process of digestion, the\r\nsubsequent vital changes involved in the conversion of food into blood,\r\nand its final transformation into tissue, causes mental languor and\r\ndullness, as well as bodily exhaustion, is attested by universal\r\nexperience. A torpid condition of the liver, one of the most inveterate\r\nof chronic derangements, is indicated by sullenness, melancholy,\r\ndespondency, loss of interest in the affairs of life, sluggishness,\r\netc., and the ultimate tendency of this morbid state is towards\r\n_suicide_. A broad and deep development of the middle lobe of the brain,\r\nshown by a fullness under the chin, and of the adjacent portion of the\r\nneck, denotes tendencies to somnambulism, delirium, and insanity. If\r\nsuch characteristics of the organization do not culminate in mental\r\nderangement, they exhibit childishness, helplessness, and great\r\ndependence. Age abates the vigor of the executive faculties, and old\r\npeople manifest not only bodily infirmities, but the relaxing and\r\nenfeebling influences proceeding from the lower portions of the brain.\r\nThey totter about in their second childhood, mentally and physically\r\nenervated. Those who become dissipated by the use of intoxicating\r\nbeverages are not only weak, trifling, and foolish, but walk with an\r\nunsteadiness which betrays their condition. These illustrations show\r\nthat this part of the brain is destitute of energy. Diseases of the\r\ndigestive organs also indicate it. Cholera, whether induced by invisible\r\nanimalcules in the air, or in water, takes the route of the alimentary\r\ncanal, opens the vital gates, and myriads of victims are swept down to\r\ndeath. It proves remarkably fatal to those having this cerebral\r\nconformation. Perhaps enough has been said to indicate the relaxing and\r\nenfeebling tendencies of this region of the brain. They may be\r\nclassified as follows:\r\n\r\n    _REGION OF FEEBLENESS._\r\n\r\n                             / SERVILITY,\r\n                             / CAUTIOUSNESS,\r\n                             / FEAR,\r\n    Cerebral Functions:      { ANXIETY,\r\n                             \\ SENSIBILITY,\r\n                             \\ CUNNING,\r\n                             \\ PROFLIGACY.\r\n\r\n                             / ATONIC,\r\n    Physiological conditions / EXCITABILITY,\r\n    and tendencies:          { RELAXATION,\r\n                             \\ FEEBLENESS,\r\n                             \\ DISEASE.\r\n\r\nThis classification shows their tendencies to chronic disease,\r\nfunctional derangement, insanity, and suicide.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore the structure of the brain was understood, Buffon spoke of it as\r\na \"mucous substance of no great importance.\" Its functional significance\r\nwas so slightly appreciated that some people hardly suspected they had\r\nany brains, until an _accident_ revealed their existence. Latterly,\r\nhowever, it is generally understood that the perfection of an animal\r\ndepends upon the number and the development of the organs controlled by\r\nthe nervous system, the sovereign power of which is symbolized by a\r\ngrand cerebrum, the throne of Reason. That animal which is so low in the\r\nscale of organization as to resemble a vegetable, belongs to an\r\nascending series ending in man. The lowest species have no conscious\r\nperception, and their movements do not necessarily indicate sensation or\r\nvolition. Instinct culminates in the _Articulates_, especially in\r\nInsects; while created intelligence reaches its acme in man, the highest\r\nrepresentative of the _Vertebrates_.\r\n\r\n    \"All things by regular degrees arise--\r\n    From mere existence unto life, from life\r\n    To intellectual power; and each degree\r\n    Has its peculiar necessary stamp,\r\n    Cognizable in forms distinct and lines.\"--LAVATER.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 76.\r\nOutline of Skulls. 1. European. 2. Negro. 3.\r\nTiger. 4. Hedge Hog. 5. Sloth.]\r\n\r\nMan, in the faculties of mind, possesses more than a complement for\r\ninstinct; some of the lower animals, however, seem to share his rational\r\nnature, and to a certain degree become responsible to him. Finally, the\r\nmanifestations of mind bear a relation to the development of cerebral\r\nsubstance, and to the bodily organization which supplies the brain with\r\nblood. Fig. 76 shows the relative amount of brain matter in the lower\r\nanimals, compared with that of man; the peculiarities of each agreeing\r\nwith its cerebral conformation. It is easier to measure the capacity of\r\nskulls in different races than to procure and weigh their brains. The\r\nfollowing table has been published.\r\n\r\n    CRANIAL CAPACITY OF HUMAN RACES.\r\n\r\n    Race.

He found that the European averaged 92 cubic\r\ninches, the Oceanic 89, the Asiatic 88, the African 86, the Australian\r\n81. Dr. Morton, of Philadelphia, had a collection of over one thousand\r\nskulls, and his conclusions were that the Caucasian brain is the\r\nlargest, the Mongolian next in size, the Malay and American Indian\r\nsmaller, and the Ethiopian smallest of all. The average weight of brain,\r\nin 278 Europeans, was 49.50 oz., in 24 White American soldiers, 52.06\r\noz., indicating a greater _average_ for the American brain.\r\n\r\n                                                             OUNCES\r\n    The brain of Cuvier, the celebrated naturalist, weighed   64.33\r\n    Ruloff, the murderer and linguist,                        59.00\r\n    Dr. Spurzheim--phrenologist,                              55.06\r\n    Celebrated philologist,                                   47.90\r\n    Celebrated mineralogist,                                  43.24\r\n    Upholsterer,                                              40.91\r\n\r\nThe weight of the human brain varies from 40 to 70 oz.; that of idiots\r\nfrom 12 to 36 40 oz. The average of 273 male European brains was 49½\r\noz., while that of 191 females was 44 oz. If we compare the weight of\r\nthe female brain with that of the body, the ratio is found to be as\r\n1:36.46, while that of the male is as 1:36.50; showing that, relatively,\r\nthe female brain is the larger. It appears that neither the absolute nor\r\nrelative size of the cerebrum, but the amount of gray matter which it\r\ncontains, is the criterion of mental power. Although a large cerebrum is\r\ngenerally indicative of more gray matter than a small one, yet it is\r\nascertained that the grey substance depends upon the number, and depth\r\nof the convolutions of the brain, and the deeper its fissures, the more\r\nabundant is this tissue. It is this substance which is the source of\r\nthought, while the white portion only transmits impressions.\r\n\r\nWe do not wish to underrate any attempt heretofore made to classify the\r\nfunctions of mind and assign to them an appropriate nomenclature. It is\r\nnot unusual for scientists to give advice to phrenologists and point out\r\nthe fallacies of their system; but it is hardly worth while to indulge\r\nin destructive criticism, unless something better is offered, as the day\r\nhas passed for ridiculing endeavors to understand and interpret the\r\nphysiology of the brain. The all important question is, not whether\r\nphrenologists have properly located and rightly earned all the faculties\r\nof mind, but have their expositions been useful in the development of\r\ntruth. While endeavoring to connect each mental power with a local\r\nhabitation in the brain, the system of phrenology may be chargeable with\r\nsome incongruous classification of the faculties, and yet it has\r\nfurnished an analysis of the mind which has been of incalculable service\r\nto writers upon mental philosophy. Phrenology, in popularizing its\r\nviews, has interested thousands in their own organizations and powers,\r\nwho would otherwise have remained indifferent. It has called attention\r\nto mental and bodily unities, has served as a guide to explain the\r\nphysical and psychical characteristics of individuals, and has been\r\ninstrumental in applying physiological and hygienic principles to the\r\nhabits of life, thus rendering a service for which the world is greatly\r\nindebted. Samuel George Morton, M.D., whose eminent abilities and\r\nscholarship are unquestionable, employs the following language:\r\n\r\n\"The importance of the brain as the seat of the faculties of the mind,\r\nis pre-eminent in the animal economy. Hence, the avidity with which its\r\nstructure and functions have been studied in our time; for, although\r\nmuch remains to be explained, much has certainly been accomplished. We\r\nhave reason to believe, not only that the brain is the center of the\r\nwhole series of mental manifestations, but that its several parts are so\r\nmany organs, each one of which performs its peculiar and distinctive\r\noffice. But the number, locality, and functions of these several organs\r\nare far from being determined; nor should this uncertainty surprise us,\r\nwhen we reflect on the slow and devious process by which mankind has\r\narrived at some of the simplest physiological truths, and the\r\ndifficulties that environ all inquiries into the nature of the organic\r\nfunctions.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 77.\r\nSide view of the brain of a Cat. A. Crucial sulcus\r\ndividing anterior convolutions. B. Fissure of\r\nSylvius. C. Olfactory bulb.]\r\n\r\nWe may here allude to the recent experimental researches with reference\r\nto the functions of various portions of the brain, prosecuted by Dr.\r\nFerrier, of England. He applied the electric current to different parts\r\nof the cortical substance of the cerebrum in lower animals which had\r\nbeen rendered insensible by chloroform, and by it could call forth\r\nmuscular actions expressive of ideas and emotions. Thus, in a cat, the\r\napplication of the electrodes at point 2, Fig. 77, caused elevation of\r\nthe shoulder and adduction of the limb, exactly as when a cat strikes a\r\nball with its paw; at point 4, corrugation of the left eye-brow, and the\r\ndrawing inward and downward of the left ear; when applied at point 5,\r\nthe animal exhibited signs of pain, screamed, and kicked with both hind\r\nlegs, especially the left, at the same time turned its head around and\r\nlooked behind in an astonished manner; at point 6, clutching movement of\r\nthe left paw, with protrusion of the claws; at point 13, twitching\r\nbackward of the left ear, and rotation of the head to the left and\r\nslightly upward, as if the animal were listening; at point 17,\r\nrestlessness, opening of the mouth, and long-continued cries as if of\r\nrage or pain; at a point on the under side of the hemisphere, not shown\r\nin this figure, the animal started up, threw back its head, opened its\r\neyes widely, lashed its tail, panted, screamed and spit as if in furious\r\nrage; and at point 20, sudden contraction of the muscles of the front of\r\nthe chest and neck, and of the depressors (muscles) of the lower jaw,\r\nwith panting movements. The movements of the paws were drawn inward by\r\nstimulating the region between points 1, 2, and 6; those of the eyelids\r\nand face were excited between 7 and 8; the side movements of the head\r\nand ear in the region between points 9 and 14; and the movements of the\r\nmouth, tongue and jaws, with certain associated movements of the neck,\r\nbeing localized in the convolutions bordering on the fissure of Sylvius\r\n(B), which marks the division between the anterior and middle lobes of\r\nthe cerebrum. Dr. Ferrier made similar experiments on dogs, rabbits, and\r\nmonkeys. The series of experiments made on the brain of the monkey is\r\nsaid to be the most remarkable and interesting, not only because of the\r\nvariety of movements and distinctly expressive character of this animal,\r\nbut on account of the close conformity which the simple arrangement of\r\nthe convolutions of its brain bears to their more complex disposition in\r\nthe human cerebrum. It is premature to say what import we shall attach\r\nto these experiments, but they have established the correctness of the\r\ndoctrine, advanced on page 105, that thought, the product of cerebral\r\nfunctions, is a class of _reflex actions_. The cerebrum is not only the\r\nsource of ideas but also of those co-ordinate movements which correspond\r\nto and accompany these ideas. Certain cerebral changes call forth mental\r\nstates and muscular movements which are mutually responsive. They\r\nindicate that various functions are automatic, or dependent upon the\r\nwill, and, as we have seen, experiments indicate that the electric\r\ncurrent, when applied to the cerebrum, excites involuntary reflex\r\naction. We cannot say how far these experimental results justify the\r\nphrenological classification of the faculties of mind, by establishing a\r\n_causative_ relation between the physical and psychical states. This\r\nshort and unsatisfactory account furnishes one fact which seems to\r\nsupport the claim of such a relation: the apparent similarity between\r\nthe motor center of the lips and tongue in lower animals, and that\r\nportion of the human cerebrum in which disease is so often found to be\r\nassociated with _Aphasia_, or loss of voice. While these experiments are\r\nby no means conclusive in establishing a theory, yet they favor it.\r\n\r\nIt is wonderful that nervous matter can be so arranged as not only to\r\nconnect the various organs of the body, but at the same time to be the\r\nagent of sensation, thought, and emotion. It is amazing, that a ray of\r\nlight, after traversing a distance of 91,000,000 miles, can, by falling\r\nupon the retina, and acting as a stimulus, not only produce a\r\ncontraction of the pupil, but excite thoughts which analyze that ray,\r\ninstantly spanning the infinitude of trackless space! The same\r\npenetrative faculties, with equal facility, can quickly and surely\r\ndiscern the morbid symptoms of body and mind, become familiar with the\r\nindications of disease, and classify them scientifically among the\r\nphenomena of nature. The symptoms of disease which follow certain\r\nconditions as regularly as do the signs of development, and mind itself\r\nis no exception to this uniformity of nature. Thoughts result from\r\nconditions, and manifest them as evidently as the falling of rain\r\nillustrates the effect of gravity. The perceptive and highest emotive\r\nfaculties of man depend upon this simple, but marvelously endowed\r\nnervous substance, which blends the higher spiritual with the lower\r\nphysical functions. The functions of the body are performed by separate\r\norgans, distinguished by peculiar characteristics. To elucidate the\r\ndistinctions between dissimilar, mental faculties, we have assigned\r\ntheir functions, with characteristic names, to different regions of the\r\nhead. As they unquestionably influence the bodily organs, we are\r\nsustained by physical analogy, in our classification. Our knowledge of\r\nthe structure and functions of the nervous system is yet elementary, and\r\nwe are patiently waiting for scientists to develop its facts, and verify\r\nthem by experimental investigations and such researches as time alone\r\ncan bring to perfection. While real progress moves with slow and\r\nmeasured foot-steps, the inspirations of consciousness and the\r\ninferences of logic prepare the popular mind for cerebral analysis. No\r\ntrue system can contradict the facts of our inner experience; it can\r\nonly furnish a more complete explanation of their relation to the bodily\r\norgans. It should be expected that such careful and pains-taking\r\nexperiments, as are necessary to establish a science, will be preceded\r\nby intuitive judgments and accredited observations, which may be, for a\r\ntime, the substitutes of those more abstruse in detail.\r\n\r\nWe have, in accordance with popular usage, treated the organs of thought\r\nas having anatomical relations. The views which we have presented in\r\nthis chapter may seem speculative, but the facts suggesting the theory\r\ndemand attention, and we have attempted to gather a few of the scattered\r\nfragments and arrange them in some order, rather than leave them to\r\nuncertainty and greater mystery. It is by method and classification that\r\nwe are enabled to apply our knowledge to practical purposes. Possibly,\r\nto some, especially the non-professional, an allusion to the fact that\r\ncerebral physiology contributes to successful results in the practice of\r\nmedicine, may seem to be an exaggerated pretension. None, however, who\r\nare conversant with the facts connected with the author's experience,\r\nwill so regard this practical reference, for the statement might be\r\ngreatly amplified without exceeding the bounds of truth. Physicians\r\ngenerally undervalue the nervous functions, and overlook the importance\r\nof the brain as an indicator of the conditions of the physical system,\r\nbecause they are not sufficiently familiar with its influence over the\r\nbodily functions. Pathological conditions are faithfully represented by\r\nthe thoughts, and words, when used to describe symptoms, become the\r\nsymbols of feelings which arise from disease. How few physicians there\r\nare who can interpret the thoughts, and glean, from the expressions and\r\nsentences of a letter, a correct idea of the morbid conditions which the\r\nwriter wishes to portray! Each malady, as well as every temperament, has\r\nits characteristics, _and both require careful and critical analysis_\r\nbefore subjecting the patient to the influence of remedial agents.\r\n\r\nIn a treatise by Dr. J.R. Buchanan, entitled \"Outlines of Lectures on\r\nthe Neurological System of Anthropology,\" are presented original ideas\r\npre-eminently useful to the physician. His researches, and those of\r\nlater writers, together with our own investigations, have greatly\r\nincreased our professional knowledge. It is by such studies and\r\ninvestigations that we have been prepared to interpret, with greater\r\nfacility, the indications of disease, and diagnose accurately from\r\nsymptoms, which have acquired a deeper significance by the light of\r\ncerebral physiology. We are enabled to adapt remedies to constitutions\r\nand their varying conditions, with a fidelity and scientific precision\r\nwhich has rendered our success in treatment widely known and generally\r\nacknowledged. We annually treat thousands of invalids whom we have never\r\nbeheld, and relieve them of their ailments. This has been accomplished\r\nchiefly through correspondence. When patients have failed to delineate\r\ntheir symptoms currently, or have given an obscure account of their\r\nailments, we have been materially assisted in ascertaining the character\r\nof the disease by photographs of the subjects. The cerebral conformation\r\nindicates the predisposition of the patient, and enables us to estimate\r\nthe strength of his recuperative energies. Thus we have a valuable guide\r\nin the selection of remedies particularly suited to different\r\nconstitutions. In the treatment of chronic diseases, the success\r\nattending our efforts has been widely appreciated, not only in this, but\r\nin other countries where civilization, refinement, luxurious habits, and\r\neffeminating customs, prevail. This fact is mentioned, not only as an\r\nillustration of the personal benefits actually derived from a thorough\r\nknowledge of the nervous system, but to show how generally and\r\nextensively these advantages have been shared by others.\r\n\r\nA careful study of cerebral physiology leads us deeper into the\r\nmysteries of the human constitution, and to the philosophical\r\ncontemplation of the relations of mind and body. Self-culture implies\r\nnot only a knowledge of the powers of the mind, but also how to direct\r\nand use them for its own improvement, and he who has the key to\r\nself-knowledge, can unlock the mysteries of human nature and be\r\neminently serviceable to the worlds For centuries the mind has been\r\nspreading out its treasury of revelations, to be turned to practical\r\naccount, in ascertaining the constitution, and determining better\r\nmethods of treating disease. Since comparative anatomists and\r\nphysiologists have revealed the structure of animals and the functions\r\nof their organs, from the lowest protozoan to the highest vertebrate,\r\nthe physician may avail himself of this knowledge, and thus gain a\r\ndeeper insight into the structure and physiology of man. An intimate\r\nacquaintance with the physical, is a necessary preparation for the study\r\nof the psychical life, for it leads to the understanding of their mutual\r\nrelations and reactions, both in health and disease.\r\n\r\nConsciousness, or the knowledge of sensations and mental operations, has\r\nbeen variously defined. It is employed as a collective term to express\r\nall the psychical states, and is the power by which the soul knows its\r\nown existence. It is the immediate knowledge of any object whatever, and\r\nseems to comprise, in its broadest signification, both matter and mind,\r\nfor all objects are inseparable from the cognizance of them. Hence, the\r\nsignificance of the terms, subjective-consciousness and\r\nobjective-consciousness. People are better satisfied with their\r\nknowledge of matter than with their conceptions of the nature of mind.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NATURE OF MIND.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince this subject is being discussed by our most distinguished\r\nscientists, we will conclude this chapter with an extract from a lecture\r\ndelivered by Prof. Burt G. Wilder, at the American Institute:\r\n\r\n\"There now remains to be disposed of, in some way, the question as to\r\nthe nature and reality of mind, which was rather evaded at the\r\ncommencement of the lecture. The reason was, that I am forced to differ\r\nwidely from the two great physiologists whom I have so often quoted this\r\nevening. Most people, following in part early instruction, in part\r\nrevelation, in part spiritual manifestations, and in part trusting to\r\ntheir own consciousness, hold that the human mind is a spiritual\r\nsubstance which is associated with the body during the life of the\r\nlatter in this world, and which remains in existence after the death of\r\nthe body, and forms the spiritual clothing or embodiment of the immortal\r\nsoul; and that the individual, therefore, lives after death as a spirit\r\nin the human form; that of this spiritual man, the soul is the essential\r\nbeing, of which may be predicted a good or evil nature, while the mind,\r\nwhich clothes it as a body, consists of the spiritual substances,\r\naffections, and thoughts, which were cherished and formed during the\r\nnatural life.\r\n\r\nTogether with the above convictions respecting themselves, most people,\r\nwhen thinking independently of theological sublimations, feel willing to\r\nadmit that animals have, in common with man, fewer or more natural\r\naffections and thoughts which make up their minds, but that the inner\r\nand immortal soul, which would retain them as part of an individual\r\nafter death of the body, is not possessed by the beasts that perish. In\r\nshort, the vast majority of mankind, when thinking quietly, and\r\nespecially in seasons of bereavement, feel well assured of the real and\r\nsubstantial existence of the human mind, independently of its temporary\r\nassociation with the perishable body.\r\n\r\nBut in antagonism to this simple and comforting faith, stand theological\r\nincomprehensibilities on the one hand, and scientific skepticism on the\r\nother. The former would have us believe that the soul is a mere vapor, a\r\ncloud of something ethereal, of which can be expected nothing more\r\nuseful than 'loafing around the Throne,' while the latter asks us to\r\nrecognize the existence of nothing which the eyes cannot see and fingers\r\ntouch; to cease imagining that there is a soul, and to regard the mind\r\nas merely the product of the brain; secreted thereby as the liver\r\nsecretes bile. Let us hear what the two leading nervous physiologists,\r\nof this country, have to say upon this point:\r\n\r\n'The brain is not, strictly speaking, the organ of the mind, for this\r\nstatement would imply that the mind exists as a force, independent of\r\nthe brain; but the mind is produced by the brain substance; and\r\nintellectual force, if we may term the intellect a force, can be\r\nproduced only by the transmutation of a certain amount of matter; there\r\ncan be no intelligence without brain substance.'--FLINT.\r\n\r\n'The mind may be regarded as a force, the result of nervous action, and\r\ncharacterized by the ability to perceive sensations, to be conscious, to\r\nunderstand, to experience emotions, and to will in accordance therewith.\r\nOf these qualities, consciousness resides exclusively in the brain, but\r\nthe others, as is clearly shown by observation and experiment, cannot be\r\nrestricted to that organ, but are developed with more or less intensity,\r\nin other parts of the nervous system.'--HAMMOND.\r\n\r\nThus do the two extremes of theology and science meet upon a common\r\nground of dreamy emptiness, and we who confess our comparative ignorance\r\nare comforted by the thought that some other things have been 'hid from\r\nthe wise and prudent and revealed unto babes.' Yet, while feeling thus,\r\nit must be admitted that the existence of spirit and of a Creator do not\r\nyet seem capable of logical demonstration. The denial of their existence\r\nis not incompatible with a profound acquaintance with material forms and\r\ntheir operations; and, on the other hand, the belief in their existence\r\nand substantial nature, and in their powers as first causes, have never\r\ninterfered with the recognition of the so-called material forces, and of\r\nthe organisms through which they are manifested. At present, at least,\r\nthese are purely matters of faith; but although the Spiritualist (using\r\nthe term in its broadest sense as indicating a belief in spirits), may\r\nfeel that his faith discloses a beauty and perfection in the union,\r\notherwise imperceptible by him, there is no reason why this difference\r\nin faith should make him despise or quarrel with his materialist\r\nco-worker, for the latter may do as good service to science, may be as\r\ntrue a man, and live as holy a life, although from other motives.\r\n\r\nThe differences between religious sects are mainly of faith, not of\r\nworks, and the wise of all denominations are gradually coming to the\r\nconviction that they will all do God more service by toleration and\r\nco-operation than by animosity and disunion. And so I hold that, until\r\nthe spiritualist feels himself able to demonstrate to the unbeliever the\r\nexistence of spirit and of God, as convincingly as a mathematical\r\nproposition, there should be no hard words or feelings upon these\r\npoints. For the present they are immaterial in every sense of the word;\r\nand so long as he bows to the facts and the laws of Nature, and deals\r\nwith his fellow men as he would be done by, so long will I work with\r\nhim, side by side, knowing, even though I cannot tell him so, that\r\nwhether or not he joins me in this world, we shall meet in the other\r\nworld to come, where his eyes will be opened, and where his lips will at\r\nleast acquit me of bigotry and intolerance.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nTHE HUMAN TEMPERAMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrganization implies vital energy, since there can be no organization\r\nwithout it. The sperm cell, as we have previously seen, exists before\r\nthe initiation of the life of every individual organism. The early\r\nhistory of this fertilizing cell, which is composed of infinitesimal\r\nmolecules which contain the embryo powers of life, is only partially\r\nwritten. It is a fact, authenticated by Faraday, that one drop of water\r\ncontains, and may be made to evolve, as much electricity as, under a\r\ndifferent mode of display, would suffice to produce a lightning-flash.\r\nChemical force is of a higher order than physical, and vital force is of\r\na still higher order. Within the microscopic compass of the sperm cell\r\nare a great number of forces acting simultaneously, which require the\r\nanswering conditions of a germ cell, and are so blended as to occupy a\r\nminimum of space. The union of these subtle elements through the agency\r\nof their physical, chemical, and vital forces, constitutes the\r\ninitiation of life. Elementary matter is transformed into chemical and\r\norganic compounds, by natural forces, upon the cessation of which, it is\r\nliberated by nature's great destroyer, and re-appears in the world of\r\nelements. Thus, man is formed out of the very dust by means of energies\r\nwhich reconstruct the crude, inert matter, and to dust he returns when\r\nthose energies cease.\r\n\r\nWhen we enter upon the consideration of the temperaments, we should bear\r\nin mind one peculiarity of life: that it combines, in a small space,\r\nmany complex powers. In the process of reproduction, there is a complex\r\ncombination of organic elements. Structures differ as greatly as their\r\nfunctions. So likewise do animals vary in their nature and organization,\r\nand individuals of the same species are, in some respects, dissimilar.\r\nYet the characteristics which have distinguished the races of mankind,\r\nare fundamental and faithfully maintained. Time does not obliterate\r\nthem. Within race-limits are found enduring peculiarities, and, although\r\neach individual is weaving out some definite pattern of organization, it\r\nfollows the type of the race, as well as the more immediate, antecedent\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nWhat then is a _Temperament_ but a _mixing together_ of these\r\ndetermining forces, a certain blending manifested in the constitution by\r\nsigns, or traits, which we denominate _character_. The different races\r\nof mankind must have their several standards of temperament, for the\r\npeculiarities of one are not fully descriptive of, and applicable to the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe term temperament is defined by Dunglison, as being \"a name given to\r\nthe remarkable differences that exist between individuals, in\r\nconsequence of the variety of relations and proportions between the\r\nconstituent parts of the body.\r\n\r\nFor its simplicity and scope, we prefer the following definition,\r\nsuggested by our friend, Orin Davis, M.D.: A TEMPERAMENT IS A\r\nCOMBINATION OF ORGANIC ELEMENTS SO ARRANGED AS TO CHARACTERIZE THE\r\nCONSTITUTION.\r\n\r\nThis leads us to consider some of the elements, conditions and forces\r\nwhich give character to the organization. External circumstances supply\r\nnecessary conditions to inward activity, for without air, food, or\r\nsunlight all living animals would perish. Everywhere, life is dependent\r\nupon conditions and circumstances; it is _not_ self-generating. But the\r\nconditions of reproduction are very complex. External forces are\r\ntransformed, and, in turn, become vital or formative powers. Development\r\nis a transmutation of physical and chemical forces into vital energy.\r\nAlthough unable to compute the ultimate factors of life, yet we may\r\nillustrate their reproductive possibilities and results by comparing\r\nthem with those of a lower order.\r\n\r\nAnimal structures are mainly composed of four elements: oxygen,\r\nhydrogen, nitrogen and carbon. Other constituents, such as phosphorus,\r\nsulphur, potassium, sodium, calcium, magnesium, and iron, enter into\r\ntheir composition, but are found in much smaller quantities. From these\r\nelements is fabricated an organism which manifests peculiar properties\r\nand marvelous functions. If the proportion of these chemical elements be\r\nvaried, the organic compound will be changed, or, the proportions\r\nremaining the same, if the _grouping_ of the elements be altered,\r\ndifferent compounds will be produced, showing that the properties of\r\norganized substances depend upon the _molecular_ constitution of matter.\r\n\r\nRising in the scale of organization, we observe that every variation of\r\nthe physical and chemical processes implies a corresponding modification\r\nof the vital. This is verified by the peculiarities of the several races\r\nof mankind. Individual differences are likewise modifications of these\r\nprocesses. Dynamical or vital differentiation depends upon these\r\nmodifications for the display of vital energy, and is always associated\r\nwith molecular changes. But it should be borne in mind that an effect\r\nmay not resemble its cause in _properties_, and the _qualities_ of a\r\nchemical compound may be quite different from those of its individual\r\nconstituents. Organic matter, although more complex, may exhibit\r\nproperties, both like and unlike its constituent elements. Within\r\ncertain boundaries, the elements seek to satisfy their affinities. We\r\ndiscover that there are limits between the genera of animals, as well as\r\nthe races of mankind. Not less really, though perhaps not as absolutely,\r\nare there individual precincts within the sphere of the human\r\ntemperaments, which cannot be passed.\r\n\r\nIf we cannot satisfactorily explain, we can at least discover a reason\r\nfor temperamental limitation. It is not designed to circumscribe\r\nhealthful reproduction, but to serve as an effectual hindrance to\r\nabnormal deviations. We may state our belief in more positive terms:\r\nthat the temperamental variations are essential to _genesis_ and\r\n_fertility_, and indispensable to _health_ and _normal development_.\r\n\r\nEvery individual is susceptible to impressions which dispose to action.\r\nImpressions which excite or increase this disposition, are called\r\n_stimuli_. Vital change implies the existence of _stimuli_ and\r\n_susceptibility_ to stimulation. The stimulus may not be furnished\r\nbecause the conditions on which it depends are wanting; again,\r\nsusceptibility may exist at one time and not at another. Stimuli and\r\nsusceptibility may be present in different degrees, but for the purpose\r\nof healthful reproduction they must not be impaired. No single class of\r\nfoods, albuminous, starchy, saccharine, or mineral, is sufficient for\r\nthe nutrition of the body, but the food must contain substances\r\nbelonging to each of the different classes. If an animal be fed\r\nexclusively upon albumen, though this substance constitutes the largest\r\npart of the bodily mass, exhaustion will rapidly follow, since the food\r\ndoes not contain all the essential, nutritive elements. Again, when the\r\nsolids of the body have been wasted, they lose their susceptibility to\r\nstimuli, and the food does no good. Thus patients become emaciated\r\nduring acute attacks of disease, upon the cessation of which they are\r\ntoo feeble to recover, simply because they have lost the power to digest\r\nand assimilate their food.\r\n\r\nIn inanimate bodies, as in crystals, forces come to rest, but the very\r\nidea of life implies action and continual change. Hence diversity of\r\nconstitutions and different temperaments are essential in order that\r\nmarriage may result in the reproduction of vigorous beings.\r\n\r\n\r\nVITAL AND NON-VITAL TEMPERAMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 78.]\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapter, we attempted to illustrate the unique blending\r\nof mind and body by means of the nervous system, and we now propose to\r\nexemplify the physical conditions of the organism by certain\r\ncorrespondences, observed in the development and conditions of that\r\nsystem. If nature answer to mind in physical correspondences, she will\r\nobserve the same regularity in physical development. The simplest\r\nclassification of the temperaments is represented in Fig. 78. Not only\r\nis mental activity dependent upon a vital activity in the brain, but the\r\ndevelopment of the cerebrum is dependent upon the supply of blood. The\r\ngrowth of the intellect requires the same conditions that aided in the\r\ndevelopment of Vulcan's right arm: waste and supply; disintegration and\r\nreparation of tissue. Our modern iron forges produce many an artisan\r\nwhose great right arm proclaims him to be a son of power as well as of\r\nfire. Thus the fervid intellect, while forging out its thoughts,\r\nincreases in size and strength. The difference between the development\r\nof the two is this; that the exercise of the blacksmith's right arm\r\nquickens the activities of all the bodily functions, whereas the\r\nemployment of the intellect does not offer any healthy equivalent.\r\nPhysical exercise is a hygienic demand, but intellectual employment\r\nexerts no salutary influence on the body, while it is constantly\r\nexpending the nutritive energies of the blood. The emotions, likewise,\r\nmake exhaustive draughts upon nutrition to supply the waste of brain\r\nsubstance, just as certainly as physical labor causes muscular change,\r\nand demands reparation. One expends cerebral, the other, muscular\r\nsubstance. The one is healthful in its general tendencies, the other,\r\ncomparatively wasteful and destructive.\r\n\r\n                                   / DISINTEGRATING,\r\n    The intellectual faculties are { EXPENDING,\r\n                                   \\ DERIVING.\r\n\r\n                                   / ENGROSSING,\r\n    The emotive faculties are      { EXHAUSTING,\r\n                                   \\ DEVITALIZING.\r\n\r\nThese nervous forces are transformed into spiritual products.\r\n\r\nThe base of the anterior lobes of the brain belong to the atonic\r\nregion--the source of those languid, deranging influences which coincide\r\nwith morbidity and disease. A disturbance of the corporeal organs, which\r\nespecially influence this portion of the brain, naturally tends to the\r\ndevelopment of insanity or imbecility. Morel has traced, through four\r\ngenerations, the family history of a youth who was admitted to the\r\nasylum at Rouen while in a state of stupidity and semi-idiocy. The\r\nfollowing summary of his investigations illustrates the natural course\r\nof degeneracy as it extends through successive generations: immorality,\r\ndepravity, alcoholic excess, and moral degradation, in the\r\ngreat-grandfather, who was killed in a tavern brawl; hereditary\r\ndrunkenness, maniacal attacks, ending in general paralysis, in the\r\ngrandfather; sobriety, but hypochondriacal tendencies, delusions of\r\npersecutions, and homicidal tendencies in the father; defective\r\nintelligence in the son. His first attack of mania occurred at sixteen,\r\nand was followed by stupidity, and finally ended in complete idiocy.\r\nFurthermore, there was probably an extinction of the family, for the\r\nson's reproductive organs were as little developed as those of a child\r\nof twelve years of age. He had two sisters who were both defective\r\nphysically and morally, and were classed as imbeciles. To complete the\r\nproof of heredity in this case, Morel adds that the mother had a child\r\nwhile the father was confined in the asylum, and that this child\r\nexhibited no signs of degeneracy. Statistics show that multitudes of\r\nhuman beings are born with a destiny against which they have neither the\r\nwill nor the power to contend; they groan under the worst of all\r\ntyrannies, the tyranny of a bad organization, which is theirs by\r\ninheritance. We may represent the tendencies of the anterior portion of\r\nthe brain by Fig. 79. The functional exercise of the anterior and\r\nsuperior portions of the cerebrum is _disintegrating_ and\r\n_devitalizing_, while the anterior and inferior portions coincide with\r\nmental and physical derangement, unless counteracted by opposing forces.\r\nIt is therefore evident that in any organization, upon which is entailed\r\na perverted or excessive action of this portion of the cerebrum, the\r\ntendencies are NON-VITAL, _i.e._, unfavorable to fertility and physical\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\nIf the antagonizing regions are well developed, the tendencies are\r\nfavorable to life.\r\n\r\n                                    / SANITY,\r\n    The volitive organs promote     { TEMPERANCE,\r\n                                    \\ HARDIHOOD.\r\n\r\n                                    / NUTRITION,\r\n    The animal organs tend to       { RESTORATION,\r\n                                    \\ CONSERVATION.\r\n\r\n                                    / SECRETION,\r\n    The basilar faculties instigate { CIRCULATION,\r\n                                    \\ VITALITY.\r\n\r\n                                    / ENERGY,\r\n    The combined action of these    { HEALTH,\r\n    faculties express               \\ REPRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 79]\r\n\r\nIf this portion of the brain indicates a full development, we say of\r\nsuch a temperament that it is VITAL, because the functions of its\r\nnerve-centers are favorable to evolution. As degeneration observes\r\nconditions, so endurance and development conform to certain laws, and it\r\nis the duty of all truthful inquirers, who believe not only in the\r\nprogress of human intelligence, but in physical improvement from\r\ngeneration to generation, to ascertain and comply with these essential\r\nconditions. When the anterior and middle lobes of the brain are fully\r\ndeveloped at their inferior surfaces, it is regarded as an insane\r\ntemperament, _i.e._ containing the germs of mental and bodily\r\nderangement.\r\n\r\nHow shall we distinguish the combination of organic elements, if not by\r\nthe manner in which they characterize the constitution? Every human\r\nbeing is distinguished by natural peculiarities, both mental and\r\nphysical. These are indicated not only by the color of the eyes, hair,\r\nand skin, and the mental expressions, but in the conformation and\r\ncapabilities of the corporeal system. The color, form, size, and texture\r\nof a leaf indicate to the expert pomologist the nature of the fruit\r\nwhich the tree will bear, but how much more important is it to\r\nunderstand the harmonies of human development. If Prof. Agassiz could\r\ndetermine the form and size of a fish by seeing its scales, and Prof.\r\nOwen outline the skeleton of an unknown animal by viewing a portion of\r\nits fossil, why should not the physician understand the language of\r\ntemperaments, since it opens to him the revelations of human\r\ndevelopment? The sculptor blends character with form, the artist endows\r\nthe face with natural expression, the anatomist accurately traces the\r\nnerves and arteries, the physiognomist reads character, which the\r\nnovelist delineates and the actor personates, because there are facts\r\nbehind all these, the materials wherewith to construct a science. In\r\norganization there are permanent forces which operate uniformly, thus\r\nrevealing the order of nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TEMPERAMENTS CLASSIFIED.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 80]\r\n\r\nWe propose to speak of four constitutional variations entitled to\r\nseparate consideration; the lymphatic, the sanguine, the volitive, and\r\nthe encephalic. The brain controls all the voluntary, and modifies the\r\ninvoluntary functions of the body. A particular cerebral development\r\nmodifies the functions of all the bodily organs, and thus tempers the\r\nconstitution. We shall, therefore, base our classification of\r\ntemperaments upon the mental and physiological characteristics, which\r\nare portrayed by cerebral development. Such an arrangement is\r\nillustrated by Fig. 80.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LYMPHATIC TEMPERAMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lymphatic temperament predominates when the anterior base of the\r\nbrain and the middle lobe are developed so as to exert a preponderating\r\ninfluence over the bodily functions. The character of this influence we\r\nhave described in cerebral physiology. It is difficult to state\r\nprecisely the normal influences and nerve-forces which arise from these\r\nfaculties, but it is evident that they are specially related to\r\nnutritive attraction, in opposition to volitive repulsion. It is only\r\ntheir excessive influence which produces worthless, miserable, morbid\r\ncharacters. A constitution marked by this development is indolent,\r\nrelaxative, and an easy prey to epidemics. This treatment is also\r\ncharacterized by a low grade of vitality or resistance. When life is\r\nsustained by the volitive powers, it is distinguished by a softness of\r\nthe bodily tissues, and the prevalence of lymph. The fact that all the\r\norganic functions are performed indolently, indicates lack of vital\r\npower. An excellent illustration of this temperament is found in Fig.\r\n81, which represents a Chinese gentleman of distinction. In the lower\r\norder of animals, as in sponges, absorption is performed by contiguous\r\ncells, which are quite as effortless as in plants. Because of their\r\norganic indolence, sponges are often classed as vegetables. A body\r\nhaving an atonic or a lymphatic temperament is abundantly supplied with\r\nabsorbent organs, which are very sluggish in their operations. In the\r\nlymphatic temperament, there seems to be less constructive energy,\r\nslower elaboration, and greater frugality. Lymph is a colorless or\r\nyellow fluid containing a large proportion of water. It is not so highly\r\norganized as the blood, but resembles it, when that fluid is deprived of\r\nits red corpuscles. In the sanguine temperament, circulation in the\r\nblood-vessels is the most active, in the lacteals next, and in the\r\nlymphatics the least so, but in the lymphatic temperament, this order is\r\nreversed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 81.]\r\n\r\nDr. W.B. Powell has observed that a lymphatic man has a large head,\r\nwhile a fat man has a small one, and also that fat and lymph, are\r\nconvertible, one following the other, _i.e.,_ \"a repletion consisting of\r\nfat may be removed, and one of lymph may replace it, and _vice versa_.\"\r\nHe could not account for these alternations. The bear goes into his\r\nwinter quarters sleek and fat, and comes forth in the spring just as\r\nplump with lymph, but he loses this fat appearance soon after obtaining\r\nfood. This simply indicates that, during lymphatic activity, the\r\ndigestive organs are comparatively quiescent. But when these are\r\nfunctionally employed again, lymphatic economy is not required. It is\r\nthe duty of the lymphatics to slowly convert the fat by such\r\ntransformation, that when it reaches the general circulation, it may\r\nthere unite with other organic compounds, the process being aided by\r\natmospheric nitrogen, introduced during the act of respiration. In this\r\nway it may become changed into those chemically indefinite, artificial\r\nproducts, called proteid compounds. This view is supported by the\r\ndisappearance of fat as an organized product in the lymph of the\r\nlymphatic vessels, indicating that such transformation has occurred. In\r\nthis way, by uniting with other organic compounds, it appears that lymph\r\nmay serve as a weak basis for blood; that atmospheric nitrogen is also\r\nemployed in forming these artificial compounds, is indicated by the fact\r\nthat there is sometimes less detected in arterial than in venous blood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 82.\r\nJudge Green, of the United States Court. ]\r\n\r\nThis temperament is indicated by lymphatic repletion, soft flesh, pale\r\ncomplexion, watery blood, slow and soft pulse, oval head, and broad\r\nskull, showing breadth at its base. Fig. 82 illustrates this temperament\r\ncombined with sanguine elements. In all good illustrations of this\r\ntemperament, there is a breadth of the anterior base of the skull\r\nextending forward to the cheek bones. There is likewise a corresponding\r\nfullness of the face under the chin, and in the neck, denoting a large\r\ndevelopment of the anterior base of the cerebrum. The cerebral\r\nconformation of the Hon. Judge Green indicates mental activity, and we\r\nhave no reason to suppose that lymph was particularly abundant in his\r\nbrain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 83.]\r\n\r\nWhile this description of the lymphatic temperament is correct, when\r\nillustrated by the civilized races of men who are accustomed to luxury,\r\nease, and an abundance of food, it does not apply with equal accuracy to\r\nthe cerebral organization of the American Indian. His skull, though\r\nbroad at its anterior base, and high and wide at the cheek bones,\r\ndiffers from the European in being broader and longer behind the ears.\r\nFig. 83 is an excellent representation of a noted North American Indian.\r\nWhile a great breadth of the base of the brain indicates morbid\r\nsusceptibilities, yet these, in the Indian, are opposed by a superior\r\nheight of the posterior part of the skull. Consequently, he is restless,\r\nimpulsive, excitable, passionate, a wanderer upon the earth. The basilar\r\nfaculties, however, are large, and he is noted for instinctive\r\nintelligence. His habits alternate from laziness to heroic effort, from\r\nidleness and quiet to the fierce excitement of the chase, from\r\nvagabondism to war, sometimes indolent and at other times turbulent, but\r\nunder all circumstances, irregular and unreliable. In this case, lacteal\r\nactivity is greater than lymphatic, as his nomadic life indicates.\r\nNevertheless, he manifests a morbid sensibility to epidemic diseases,\r\nespecially those which engender nutritive disorders and corrupt the\r\nblood. Figs. 84 and 85 represent the brain of an American Indian, and\r\nthat of a European, and show the remarkable difference in their\r\nanatomical configuration. Evidently it is a race-distinction. Observe\r\nthe greater breadth of the brain of the Indian, which according to\r\ncerebral physiology indicates great alimentiveness, indolence, morbid\r\nsensibility, irritability, profligacy, but also note that it _differs\r\nmaterially in the proportion of all its parts_, from the European brain.\r\nJudging the character of the Indian from the aforesaid representation,\r\nwe should say that he was cunning, excitable, treacherous, fitful,\r\ntaciturn, or violently demonstrative. His constitution is very\r\nsusceptible to diseases of the bowels and blood. His appetite is\r\nungovernable, and his love of stimulants is strong. Syphilitic poison,\r\nsmall-pox, and strong drink will annihilate all these tribes sooner than\r\ngunpowder. Their physical traits of constitution are no less\r\ncontradictory than their extremes of habit and character, for while\r\nthere is evidence of _lymphatic elements_, yet it is contradicted by the\r\ncolor of the hair, eyes, and skin. This peculiar organization will not\r\nblend in healthful harmony with that of the European, and this\r\ndemonstrates that the race-temperaments require separate and careful\r\nanalytical consideration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 84.\r\n               American Indian.\r\n               Fig 85.\r\n               European.\r\n\r\n(FROM MORTON'S CRANIA AMERICANA.)\r\n\r\nIn the American Indian, the anterior lobe, lying between _AA_, and\r\n_BB_, is small, and in the European it is large, in proportion to the\r\nmiddle, lying between _BB_ and _CC_. In the American Indian, the\r\nposterior lobe, lying between _C_ and _D_ Is much smaller than in the\r\nEuropean. In the Indian, the cerebral convolutions on the anterior\r\nlobe and upper surface of the brain, are smaller than the European. If\r\nthe anterior lobe manifests the intellectual faculties--the middle\r\nlobe the propensities common to man with the lower animals--and the\r\nposterior lobe, the conservative energies, the result seems to be,\r\nthat the intellect of the American Indian is comparatively feeble--the\r\nEuropean, strong; the animal propensities of the Indian will be\r\ngreat--in the European, more moderate; while reproduction, vital\r\nenergy, and conservation of the species in the Indian is not as great\r\nas with the European. The relative proportions of the different parts\r\nof the brain differ very materially.]\r\n\r\nBy physical culture and regulation of the habits, the excessive\r\ntendencies of this temperament may be restrained. Solid food should be\r\nsubstituted for a watery diet. If it be limited in quantity, this change\r\nwill not only diminish the size, but increase the strength of the body.\r\nThe body should be disciplined by daily percussion until the imperfectly\r\nconstructed cells, which are too feeble to resist this treatment, are\r\nbroken and replaced by those more hardy and enduring. Add to this\r\ntreatment brisk, dry rubbing, calisthenic exercises, and daily walks,\r\nwhich should be gradually extended. Continue this treatment for three\r\nmonths, and its favorable effects upon the temperament will surprise the\r\nmost skeptical; if continued for a year, a radical alteration will be\r\neffected, and the hardihood, health, and vigor of the constitution will\r\nbe greatly increased.\r\n\r\nThis temperament may be improved physiologically, by being blended with\r\nthe sanguine and volitive. The offspring will be stronger, the\r\nstructures firmer, the organization more dense. Nutrition, assimilation,\r\nand all the constructive functions will be more energetic in weaving\r\ntogether the cellular fabric of the body. The sanguine temperament will\r\nadd a stimulus to the organic activities, while the volitive will\r\ncommunicate manly, brave, and enduring qualities. When this temperament\r\nis united with the encephalic, if such a union does not result in\r\nbarrenness, it adds _expending_ and _exhaustive_ tendencies to the\r\n_enfeebling_'ones already existing, and, consequently, the offspring\r\nlacks both physical power and intellectual activity.\r\n\r\nThe peculiarities of this temperament are observed in the diseases which\r\ncharacterize it. It is specially liable to derangements of digestion,\r\nnutrition, and blood-making. The blood is easily poisoned by morbid\r\nproducts formed within the body, as well as by those derived from the\r\nbody of another. This is seen in pyæmia, produced by the introduction of\r\ndecomposing pus, or \"matter,\" into the blood. This condition is most\r\nlikely to occur when the vital powers are low and the energies weak, for\r\nthen the fibrin decreases, the red corpuscles diminish in number, the\r\ncirculation becomes languid, the pulse grows fluttering and weak, and\r\nthis increases until death ensues. An individual of this temperament is\r\nmore easily destroyed than any other \"by the poison of syphilis,\r\nsmall-pox, and other contagious diseases. If the blood has received any\r\nhereditary taint, the lymphatic glands not only reproduce it but often\r\nincrease the virulency of the original disease. This temperament\r\nindicates a necessity for the employment of stimulating, alterative, and\r\nantiseptic medicines. The torpid functions need arousing, the blood\r\nneeds depuration, i.e., the elimination of corrupting matter, and the\r\nsystem requires alteratives to produce these salutary changes. The\r\nsecretions need the correcting influence of cleansing remedies for the\r\npurification of the blood.\r\n\r\nPersons of this temperament are more liable to absorption of morbid\r\nproducts within the body, which are in a state of decomposition,\r\nproducing an infection of the blood, technically termed _septicæmia_.\r\nThe fatal results which so suddenly follow child-bed fever are thus\r\nproduced. This kind of poisoning sometimes takes place from the\r\nabsorption of decomposed exudation in diphtheria, and, though rarely,\r\nfrom decomposing organic products collected in the lungs. Whenever the\r\nabsorption of poison does take place, fatal consequences usually follow.\r\n\r\nThis passive temperament is more likely to sink under acute attacks of\r\ndisease, especially alimentary disorders, such as diarrhea, dysentery,\r\nand cholera. It quickly succumbs to their prostrating effects, such as\r\ndepression, congestion, and fatal collapse which rapidly succeed one\r\nanother. Venesection and harsh purgatives are contra-indicated, and the\r\nphysician who persists in their employment kills his patient. How\r\ngrateful are warmth and stimulating medicines! The most powerful,\r\ndiffusible, and nervous stimulants are required in cholera, when the\r\nsystem is devastated by the disease, as the plain is laid waste by the\r\nfierce tornado.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SANGUINE TEMPERAMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nLymph is the characteristic of the lymphatic temperament, and its\r\nspecific gravity, temperature, and standard of vitality are all lower\r\nthan that of red blood. In the sanguine temperament all the vital\r\nfunctions are more active, the blood itself has a deeper hue, its\r\ncorpuscles carry more oxygen, the complexion is quite florid, and the\r\narterial currents impart to every faculty a more hopeful vigor. The\r\nblood-vessels are the most active absorbents, eagerly appropriating\r\nnutritive materials for the general circulation, while the respiration\r\nadds to it oxygen, that agent which makes vital manifestation possible.\r\nThis temperament exhibits greater sensibility, the conceptions are\r\nquicker, the imagination more vivid, the appetite stronger, the passions\r\nmore violent, and there is found every display of animal life and\r\nenjoyment.\r\n\r\nA full development of the basilar faculties, indicated by an unusual\r\nbreadth and depth of the base of the brain, accompanies this\r\ntemperament. Its cerebral area includes the posterior and inferior\r\nportions of the cerebrum, the entire cerebellum, and that part of the\r\nmedulla which connects with the spinal cord, all of which sustain\r\nintimate relations to vital conditions. Accordingly, such a development\r\nindicates good digestion, active nutrition, vigorous secretion, large\r\nheart and lungs, powerful muscles, and surplus vitality. The violent\r\nfaculties, such as Combativeness, Destructiveness, and Hatred, are\r\nnatural adjuncts, and their excess tends to sensuality and crime. They\r\nare not only secretive, appropriative, selfish, and self-defensive, but\r\nwhen redundant are aggressive and tend to destructiveness, the\r\ngratification of animal indulgence, intemperance, and debauchery. The\r\ncorrespondence between the cerebral conformation and the physical\r\ndevelopment is very obvious. Lower orders of animals possess these\r\nfaculties, and their spontaneous exhibition is called instinct. They\r\npossess the acquisitive, destructive, and propagative propensities,\r\nwhich lead them to provide for their wants and secure to themselves a\r\nposterity. The exercise of their bodies causes a continual waste which\r\ndemands incessant reparation, and they are governed measurably by these\r\nanimal impulses.\r\n\r\nAll of these lower psychical faculties have a physiological\r\nsignificance. Acquisitiveness functionally expresses assimilation,\r\naccretion, animal growth, and tends to bodily repletion. Secretiveness\r\nexpresses concealing, separating, withdrawing, and functionally\r\nsignifies secretive action. Secretion is the separating and withdrawing\r\nfrom the blood some of its constituents, as mucus, bile, saliva, etc.\r\nThis latter process indicates complex conditions of organization, so\r\nthat the higher and more complex the tissue, the greater the number of\r\nsecretory organs. Unrestrained selfishness, while it naturally conserves\r\nthe individual interests, in its ultimate tendencies, is the very\r\nessence of human depravity. Without qualification, clearly, it is crime,\r\nfor blind devotion to the individual must be in utter disregard for the\r\ngood of others. The ultimate tendencies of these faculties are,\r\ntherefore, criminal.\r\n\r\nExaggerate the faculty of acquisitiveness, and it becomes\r\navariciousness. Develop secretiveness and selfishness, and they become\r\ncunning and profligacy, desperation and crime. Their functional\r\ndevelopment tends to produce physical disorder and violent disease. All\r\nof these faculties are vehement, contentious, thriving by opposition.\r\nLife itself has been called a forced state, because it wars with the\r\nelements it appropriates, and transmutes their powers into vitality.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 86.]\r\n\r\nWe find men and women of this temperament, who are models of character\r\nand organization. George Washington is an excellent illustration. The\r\nimpression that his presence made upon the Marquis de Chastellux, is\r\ngiven in the following words: \"I wish only to express the impression\r\nGeneral Washington has left on my mind; the idea of a perfect whole,\r\nbrave without temerity, laborious without ambition, generous without\r\nprodigality, noble without pride, virtuous without severity.\" Gen.\r\nScott, Lord Cornwallis, Dr. Wistar, Bishop Soule John Bright, Jenny Lind\r\nGoldsmidt, and Dr. Gall are good representatives of this temperament.\r\nFig. 86 is an excellent illustration of it, finely blended and well\r\nbalanced, in the person of Madame de Stael. This temperament requires\r\nfewer tonics and stimulants than the lymphatic. This constitution is\r\nbest able to restore vital losses. It is a vital temperament, in other\r\nwords, it combines favorably with all the others, and better adapts\r\nitself to their various conditions. Some regard it as the best adjusted\r\none in all its organs and tissues, and as the most satisfactory and\r\nserviceable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 87.]\r\n\r\nExcess of nutrition tends to plethora, to animal indulgence, and gross\r\nsensuality. Not only do the propensities rouse desire, but they excite\r\nthe basilar faculties, and portray their wants in the outlines of the\r\nface, mould the features to their expression, and flash their\r\nsignificance from the eye. Who can mistake the picture of sensuality\r\nrepresented by Fig. 87? It is enough to shock the sensibility of a dumb\r\nanimal, and to say that such a face has a beastly look, is an unkind\r\nreflection upon the brute creation. A large neck and corresponding\r\ndevelopment of the occipital half of the brain indicate nervous energy,\r\nyet nutrition is not absolutely dependent upon it, for the nutritive\r\nprocesses are active before a nervous system is formed. The lower\r\nfaculties of the mind exert a remarkable influence over nutrition,\r\nsecretion, and the molecular changes incident to life. Anger or fear may\r\ntransmute the mother's nourishing milk into a virulent poison. The\r\nfollowing incident, taken from Dr. Carpenter's Physiology, illustrates\r\nthis statement: \"A carpenter fell into a quarrel with a soldier billeted\r\nin his house, and was set-upon by the latter with his drawn sword. The\r\nwife of the carpenter at first trembled from fear and terror, and then\r\nsuddenly threw herself between the combatants, wrested the sword from\r\nthe soldier's hand, broke it in pieces, and threw it away. During the\r\ntumult, some neighbors came-in and separated the men. While in this\r\nstate of strong excitement, the mother took up her child from the\r\ncradle, where it lay playing, and in the most perfect health, never\r\nhaving had a moment's illness; she gave it the breast, and in so doing\r\nsealed its fate. In a few minutes the infant left-off sucking, became\r\nrestless, panted, and sank dead upon the mother's bosom. The physician\r\nwho was instantly called-in, found the child lying in the cradle, as if\r\nasleep, and with its features undisturbed; but all resources were\r\nfruitless. It was irrecoverably gone. In this interesting case, the milk\r\nmust have undergone a change, which gave it a powerful sedative action\r\nupon the susceptible nervous system of the infant.\"\r\n\r\nAnxiety, irritation, hatred, all tend to the vitiation of the\r\ndisposition and bodily functions, perverting the character and\r\nconstitution at the same time. Depravity of thought and secretion go\r\ntogether. Degradation of mind and corruption of the body are\r\nconcomitants. There is a very close affinity between mental and moral\r\nperversion and physical prostitution, of which fact too many are\r\nunconscious. Nervous influence preserves the fluidity of the blood and\r\nfacilitates its circulation, for it appears that simple _arrestment_ of\r\nthis influence favors the coagulation of the blood in the vessels; clots\r\nbeing found in their trunks within a few minutes after the brain and\r\nspinal marrow are broken down. Habitual constipation is the source of\r\nmany ills. Perversion of the functions of the stomach, and of the\r\ncirculation of the blood, produce general disaster.\r\n\r\nDiseases which characterize this temperament are acute, violent, or\r\ninflammatory, indicating repletion and active congestion; intense\r\ninflammation, burning fevers, severe rheumatism, a quick, full pulse,\r\ngreat bodily heat, and functional excitement are its morbid\r\naccompaniments. These diseases will bear thorough depletion of the\r\nalimentary canal, active, hydragogue cathartics being indicated.\r\nSedatives and anodynes are also essential to modify the circulatory\r\nforces, and to relieve pain. Violent disturbance must be quelled, and\r\namong the remedial agents required for this duty we may include\r\nVeratrum, Ipecac, Digitalis, Opium, Conium, and Asclepias. While\r\nequalizing the circulatory fluids, restoring the secretions, and\r\nthoroughly evacuating the system, and thus endeavoring to remove\r\ndisturbing causes, we find that the conditions of this temperament are\r\nexceedingly favorable for restoration to health. True, many chronic\r\ndiseases are obstinate, yet a course of restorative medication\r\npersistently followed, promises a fortunate issue in this tractile\r\ntemperament.\r\n\r\nHygienic management of the lymphatic and sanguine temperaments consists\r\nin the vigorous toning of the former, while restraint of the latter will\r\ngreatly exempt it from the anxieties, contentions, and vexations which\r\nexcite the mind, disturb the bodily functions, and end in chronic\r\ndisease. People of the latter organization love mental and physical\r\nstimulants, are easily inflamed by passion, and their excitability\r\ndegenerates into irritability, succeeded by serious functional\r\nderangements, which prematurely break down the individual with\r\ninveterate, deep-seated disorder. Serenity, hope, faith, as well as\r\nfirmness, are natural hygienic elements. It is a duty we owe ourselves\r\nto promptly relinquish a business which corrodes with its cares, and\r\ndepresses with its increasing troubles. Constant solicitude, and the\r\napprehension of financial disaster, frustrate the bodily functions,\r\ndisconcert the organic processes, and lead to mental aberration as well\r\nas physical degeneracy. Melancholy is chronic, while despair is acute\r\nmania, whose impulses drive the victim desperately toward\r\nself-destruction. The chronic derangement of these organs exerts with\r\nless force the same morbid tendency. Hence the necessity for exercising\r\nthose hygienic and countervailing influences born of resolution,\r\nassurance, and confident trust, and the belief which strengthens all of\r\nthe vital operations.\r\n\r\nDoubtless, this temperament is the source of the reproductive powers. It\r\nis the corner-stone essential to the foundation of all other\r\ntemperaments. It has been supposed by some that the cerebellum is the\r\nseat of sexual instinct. The fact appears that an ample development of\r\nthe posterior base of the cerebrum and the cerebellum indicates\r\nnutritive activity, which is certainly a condition most favorable to the\r\ndisplay of amativeness. In a double sense, then, this temperament is a\r\nvital one; both by nutritive repletion, and by reproduction. It is the\r\nblood-manufacturing, tissue-generating, and body-constructing\r\ntemperament, causing growth to exceed waste, and promptly repairing the\r\nwear which follows continual labor.\r\n\r\nWhile the sleazy structures of the lymphatic temperament are favorable\r\nto the functions of transudation, exhalation, and mutual diffusion of\r\nliquids, the sanguine, as its name indicates, is adapted to promote the\r\ncirculation of the blood, to favor nutrition and reproduction. The\r\nformer temperament does not move the world by its energies, or impress\r\nit vividly with its wisdom, and the latter is more enthusiastic,\r\nenjoyable, and quickening. Each temperament, however, possesses salient\r\nqualities and advantages.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIFE LINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. W.B. Powell, in his work on \"The Human Temperaments,\" announces the\r\ndiscovery of a measurement which indicates the tenacity of life, and the\r\nvital possessions of the individual. He has observed that some persons\r\nof very feeble appearance possess remarkable powers of resistance to\r\ndisease, and continue to live until the machinery of life literally\r\nwears out. Others, apparently stronger and more robust, die before the\r\nusual term of life is half completed. He also noticed that some families\r\nwere remarkable for their longevity, while others reached only a certain\r\nage, less than the average term of life, and then died. He remarked also\r\nthat some patients sank under attacks of disease, when, to all\r\nappearances, they should recover, and that others recovered, when,\r\naccording to all reasonable calculations, they ought to die. He,\r\ntherefore, not only believed that the duration of human life was more\r\ndefinitely fixed by the organization than is supposed, but he set\r\nhimself to work to discover the line of life, and the measure of its\r\nduration. He made a distinction between vital vigor, and vital tenacity.\r\n_Vital vigor_ he believed to be equivalent to the condition of vitality,\r\nwhich is indicated by the breadth of the brain found in the sanguine\r\ntemperament; and _vital tenacity_ to be measured by the _depth_ of the\r\nbase of the brain. Dr. Powell was an indefatigable student of nature,\r\nand followed his theory through years of observation, and measured\r\nhundreds of heads of living persons, in order to verify the correctness\r\nof the hypothesis. His method of measuring the head may be stated as\r\nfollows: He drew a line from the occipital protuberance on the back of\r\nthe head to the junction of the frontal and malar bones, extending it to\r\na point above the center of the external orbit of the eye, near the\r\ntermination of the brow. Then he measured the distance between this line\r\nand the orifice of the ear and thus obtained the measure indicating the\r\nvital tenacity or duration of, life. Fig. 88 is a representation of the\r\nskull of Loper, who was executed for murder in Mississippi. He might\r\nhave attained a great age, had not his violent and selfish faculties led\r\nhim into the commission of crime. In this illustration, B represents the\r\noccipital protuberance, and A the junction of the frontal and malar\r\nbones at the external angle of the eye. The distance between this line\r\n(A B) and the external orifice of the ear, is the measure of the\r\nlife-force of Loper at the time of his: execution.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 88.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 89.]\r\n\r\nThe tenacity of an individual's life, Dr. Powell determined by the\r\nfollowing scale of measurements: three-fourths of an inch from the\r\norifice of the ear to the life-line, is the average length in the adult,\r\nand indicates _ordinary_ tenacity of life. As the distance decreases to\r\nfive-eighths, one-half, or three-eighths of an inch, vital tenacity\r\ndiminishes. If the distance is more than three-quarters of an inch, it\r\ndenotes great vital endurance, excellent recuperative powers, and is\r\nindicative of longevity. If it measures less than half an inch, it shows\r\nthat the constitution has a feeble, uncertain hold upon life, and an\r\nacute disease is very likely to sunder the vital relations. Dr. Powell\r\ncontended that \"life force and vital force are not equivalent terms,\r\nbecause much more vital force is expended upon our relations, than upon\r\nour organization in the preservation of life. Every muscular\r\ncontraction, every thought, and every emotion requires an expenditure of\r\nvital force.\" He asserted that we _inherit_ our life force or\r\nconstitutional power, and that we can determine by this _life-line,_ the\r\namount which we so receive. And he believed that it could be increased\r\nby _intellectual_ effort, just as we can increase vital force by\r\n_physical_ exercise. Fig. 89 represents the skull of a man who died, at\r\nnearly the same age as Loper, of consumption, in the Charity Hospital,\r\nat New Orleans. The measurement of the skull in this case gives a space\r\nbetween the life-line and the orifice of the ear of one-sixteenth of an\r\ninch, showing that the consumptive had lived the full term of his life.\r\nDr. Powell contended that the depth of a man's brain may be increased\r\nafter maturity; muscular effort, mental activity, and a sense of\r\nresponsibility being favorable to longevity, while idleness and\r\ndissipation are adverse to it. In justice to the Doctor, we have stated\r\nfully his theory and his method of determining the hardihood and\r\nendurance of the constitution, and we bespeak for it a candid\r\nexamination. Without doubt it embodies a great deal of truth. Hereafter\r\nwe shall endeavor to indicate by cerebral configuration, a better system\r\nof judging of the vital tenacity, hardihood, and constitutional\r\nenergies, both inherited and acquired.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VOLITIVE TEMPERAMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy reference to Figs. 72 and 80, the reader will be able to locate the\r\nregion of the volitive faculties, previously described under the generic\r\nterm _will_. This temperament is characterized by ambition, energy,\r\nindustry, perseverance, decision, vigilance, self-control, arrogance,\r\nlove of power, firmness, and hardihood. These faculties express\r\nconcentration of purpose and their functional equivalents are power of\r\nelaboration, constructiveness, condensation, firmness of fiber,\r\ncompactness of frame, and endurance of organization. The pulse is full,\r\nfirm, and regular, the muscles are strong and well marked, the hair and\r\nskin dark, the temporal region is not broadly developed, the face is\r\nangular, its lines denoting both power of purpose and strength of\r\nconstitution, with resolution and hardihood blended in the expression.\r\nThe volitive temperament is distinguished by height of the posterior,\r\nsuperior occipital region, called the crown of the back head, and by\r\ncorresponding breadth from side to side. The rule given by Dr. J.R.\r\nBuchanan applies not only to the convolutions, but to the general\r\ndevelopment of the brain; _length gives power, or range of action_, and\r\n_breadth gives copiousness, or activity of manifestation_. Thus a high,\r\n_narrow_ back head indicates firmness and decision, but it is not as\r\nconstant and copious in its manifestation as when it is associated with\r\nbreadth. An individual having a narrow, high head, may determine readily\r\nenough upon a course of action, but he requires a longer period for its\r\ncompletion than one whose head is both high and broad. Such a cerebral\r\nconformation cannot accomplish its objects without enjoying regular\r\nrest, and maintaining the best of habits. Breadth of this region of the\r\nbrain indicates ample resources of energy, both psychical and physical.\r\nIt denotes greater vigor of constitution, one that continually generates\r\nvolitive forces, and its persistency of purpose may be interpreted as\r\nfunctional tenacity. Inflexibility of will and purpose impart their\r\ntenacious qualities to every bodily function. The _will_ to recover is\r\noften far more potent than medicine. We have often witnessed its power\r\nin restraining the ravages of disease. The energetic faculties, located\r\nat the upper and posterior part of the head, are the invigorating, or\r\n_tonic_ elements of the constitution, imparting hardy, firm, steady, and\r\nefficient influences, checking excess of secretion, repressing\r\ndissipation, and tending to maintain self-possession, as well as healthy\r\nconditions of life. Fig. 90 is a portrait of U.S. Grant, which shows a\r\nwell-balanced organization, with sufficient volitive elements to\r\ncharacterize the constitution.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 90.]\r\n\r\nThe old term _bilious temperament_ might possibly be retained in\r\ndeference to long usage, did it not inculcate a radical error. _Bilious_\r\nis strictly a medical term, relating to bile, or to derangements\r\nproduced by it, and it was used originally to distinguish a temperament\r\nsupposed to be characterized by a predominance of the biliary secretion.\r\nIn the volitive temperament, the firm, tenacious, toning, and\r\nrestraining faculties _repress_, rather than _encourage_ biliary\r\nsecretion, and hence the necessity for administering large doses of\r\ncholagogues, remedies which stimulate the secretion of bile. When the\r\nsystem is surcharged with bile, from a congested condition of the liver,\r\nwe use these agents in order to obtain necessary relief. In this\r\ntemperament there is moderate hepatic development, lack of biliary\r\nactivity, deficiency in the secretion of bile, and a sluggish portal\r\ncirculation. Therefore, to apply the term bilious to this temperament is\r\nnot only unreasonable, but it is calculated to mislead. The condition of\r\nthe bowels is generally constipated, the skin dark and sometimes sallow.\r\nFor these and other obvious reasons, we dismiss the word _bilious_, and\r\nsubstitute one which is more characteristic.\r\n\r\nWe will not dwell upon the volitive as _psychical_ organs, except to\r\nshow that, when their influence is transmitted to the body, they act as\r\n_physiological_ organs, and thus demonstrate that all parts of the brain\r\nhave their physiological, as well as mental functions. When Andrew\r\nJackson uttered with great emphasis the memorable words, \"BY THE\r\nETERNAL,\" the effect was like a shock from a galvanic battery, thrilling\r\nthe cells in his own body, and paralyzing with fear every one in\r\nCalhoun's organization. This is an illustration of the power or range of\r\naction of these faculties. Breadth or copiousness is illustrated in Gen.\r\nGrant's reply, \"I PROPOSE TO FIGHT IT OUT ON THIS LINE, IF IT TAKES ALL\r\nSUMMER.\" Such a temperament has a profusion of constitutional power,\r\ngreat durability of the life-force, and, in our opinion, the combined\r\nheight and breadth of this region correctly indicate the natural\r\nhardihood of the body and its _retentiveness of life_. No one need doubt\r\nits influence upon the sympathetic system, and, through that system, its\r\npower over absorption, circulation, assimilation, and secretion, as well\r\nas the voluntary processes. Mental hardihood seems wrought into concrete\r\norganization. It checks excess of glandular absorption, restrains the\r\nimpulses of tumultuous passion, tones and regulates the action of the\r\nheart, and helps to weave the strands of organization into a more\r\ncompact fabric. The toning energies of the volitive faculties are better\r\nthan quinine to fortify the system against _miasma_ or _malaria_, and\r\nthey co-operate with all tonic remedies in sustaining organic action.\r\nFig. 91 is a portrait of Prof. Tyndall, the eminent chemist, whose\r\nlikeness indicates volitive innervation, showing great strength of\r\ncharacter and of constitution; he is an earnest, thorough, and intense\r\nmental toiler; ambitious, but modest; brilliant, because persevering;\r\ndiligent in scientific inquiry, and who follows the star of truth,\r\nwhithersoever it may lead him. The expression of his countenance\r\nindicates his honest intentions, and displays strength of conscientious\r\npurpose; his physical constitution may be correctly interpreted in all\r\nof its general characteristics by the analysis of his energetic\r\ntemperament, the great secret of his strength and success.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 91.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 92.]\r\n\r\nWe desire to offer one more illustration of a marvelous blending of this\r\ntemperament with large mental and emotional faculties. Fig. 92 is a\r\nrepresentation of the martyred President Abraham Lincoln. During an\r\neventful career, his temperament and constitution experienced marked\r\nchanges, and while always distinguished for strength of purpose and\r\ncorresponding physical endurance, he was governed by noble, moral\r\nfaculties, manifesting the deepest sympathy for the down-trodden and\r\noppressed, blending tenderness and stateliness without weakness,\r\nexhibiting a human kindness, and displaying a genuine compassion, which\r\nendeared him to all hearts. He was hopeful, patriotic, _magnanimous_\r\neven, while upholding the majesty of the law and administering the\r\ncomplicated affairs of government. The balances of his temperament\r\noperated with wonderful delicacy, through all the perturbating\r\ninfluences of the rebellion, showing by their persistence that he was\r\nnever for a moment turned aside from the great end he had in view; the\r\nprotection and perpetuation of republican liberty. His life exhibited a\r\nsublime, moral heroism, elements of character which hallow his name, and\r\nkeep it in everlasting remembrance.\r\n\r\nWe have treated the brain, not as a mass of organs radiating from the\r\nmedulla oblongata as their real center, but as two cerebral masses, each\r\nof which is developed around the great ventricle. We have freely applied\r\nan easy psychical and physiological nomenclature to the functions of its\r\norgans, knowing that there is no arbitrary division of them by specific\r\nnumber, for the cerebrum, in an anatomical sense, is a single organ. The\r\ndoctrine of cerebral unity is true, and the doctrine of its plurality of\r\nfunction is true also. Whatever effect an organ produces when acting in\r\nentire predominance, is regarded as the function of that organ and is\r\nexpressed by that name. Although our names and divisions are arbitrary\r\nand designed for convenience, yet they facilitate our consideration of\r\nthe psychical, and their corresponding physiological functions. Every\r\ncerebral manifestation denotes a _psychical_ organ, and in proportion as\r\nthese acts are transmitted to the body it becomes a _physiological_\r\norgan. We have ventured to repeat this proposition for the sake of the\r\nnon-professional reader, that he may be able to distinguish between' the\r\ntwo results of the manifestation of one organ. The transmission of the\r\ninfluence of the brain into the body enables the former to act\r\nphysiologically, whereas, if its action were confined within the\r\ncranium, it would only be psychical. In the language of Prof. J.R.\r\nBuchanan, \"every organ, therefore, has its mental and corporeal, its\r\npsychological and physiological functions--both usually manifested\r\ntogether--_either capable of assuming the predominance_.\" We have\r\nalready seen to what degree the _Will_ operates upon the organism, or\r\nhow \"the soul imparts special energy to single organs, so that they\r\nperform their functions with more than usual efficiency,\" and thus\r\nresist the solicitations of morbific agents. Doubtless our best thoughts\r\nare deeply tinged by the healthful or diseased conditions of such organs\r\nas the stomach, the lungs, the heart, or even the muscular or\r\ncirculatory systems, and these impressions, when carried to the\r\nsensorium, are reflected by the thoughts, for reflex action is the third\r\nclass of functions, assigned to the cerebrum. These reflex actions are\r\neither hygienic and remedial, or morbid and pernicious. Hence, it is\r\nphilosophical not only to interpret the thoughts as physiological and\r\npathological indications, but to consider the cerebrum as exerting real\r\nhygienic and remedial forces, capable of producing salutary reparative,\r\nand restorative effects. When a boiler carries more steam than can be\r\nadvantageously employed, it is subjected to unnecessary and injurious\r\nstrain, and is weakened thereby; so, when the body is overtasked by\r\nexcessive pressure of the volitive faculties, it is prematurely\r\nenfeebled and broken down. There are many individuals who need to make\r\nuse of some sort of safety valve to let off the surplus of their\r\ninordinate ambition; they need some kind of patent brake to slacken\r\ntheir speed of living; they should relieve the friction of their\r\nfunctional powers by a more frequent lubrication of the vital movements,\r\nand by stopping, for needed refreshment and rest, at some of the many\r\nway-stations of life.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ENCEPHALIC TEMPERAMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe encephalic temperament is distinguished by prominence and breadth of\r\nthe forehead, or by a full forehead associated with height and breadth\r\nat its coronal junction with the parietal bones, and extending toward\r\nthe volitive region. (See Fig. 10, the space between 1 and 2 represents\r\nthe coronal region, 1 indicating the frontal bone, and 2 the parietal).\r\nProminence and great breadth of the forehead display _analytical, i.e._,\r\nscientific powers applicable to concretes, whereas a fair intellect,\r\nassociated with a preponderating development of the coronal region,\r\nindicates _analogical_ powers, _i.e._, faculties to perceive the\r\nrelation and the agreement of principles. The former classifies and\r\narranges facts, the latter invests them with moral and spiritual import.\r\nThe one treats of matter, its physical properties, and chemical\r\ncomposition, the other of thoughts and intentions which involve right\r\nand wrong, relating to spiritual accountability. The intellect is\r\nemployed upon an observable order of things, while the emotive faculties\r\narrange the general laws of being into abstract science.\r\n\r\nFig. 93, a portrait of Prof. Tholuck, is a remarkable example of an\r\nencephalic organization. Figs. 72 and 79 fairly indicate the effects of\r\nundue mental activity, the intellect causing vital expenditure resulting\r\nin the devitalization of the blood. While the intellect displays keen\r\npenetration, subtle discrimination, and profound discernment, the\r\nemotions exhibit intense sensitiveness, acute susceptibility, and\r\ninspirational impressibility. The encephalic temperament is\r\ncharacterized by mental activity, great delicacy of organization, a high\r\nand broad forehead, expressive eyes, fine but not very abundant hair,\r\ngreat sensitiveness, refined feelings, vividness of conception, and\r\nintensity of emotion. If the brain is developed on the sides, there is\r\nmanifested Ideality, Modesty, Hope, Sublimity, Imagination, and\r\nSpirituality. If the brain and forehead project, the Perceptive,\r\nIntuitive, and Reasoning faculties predominate. If it rises high, and\r\nnearly perpendicularly, Liberality, Sympathy, Truthfulness, and\r\nSociability are manifested. When the emotive faculties are large, Faith,\r\nHope, Love, Philanthropy, Religion, and Devotion characterize the\r\nindividual. It is an artistic, creative, and aesthetic temperament,\r\nbeautiful in conception and grand in expression, yet its sensitiveness\r\nis enfeebling, and its crowning excellence, when betrayed by the\r\npropensities, trails in defilement. Its purity is God-like, its\r\ndebauchment, Perdition!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 93.]\r\n\r\nFig. 94 is the likeness of Prof. George Bush. His forehead is amply\r\ndeveloped in the region of Foresight, Liberality, Sympathy,\r\nTruthfulness, and Benevolence; his mouth expresses Amiability and\r\nCheerfulness, and the whole face beams with Kindness and Generosity.\r\nThis philanthropist, who is both a preacher and an author, has published\r\nseveral works upon theology, which distinguish him for great research\r\nand originality.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 94.]\r\n\r\nFig. 95 represents the sanguine-encephalic temperament, the two elements\r\nbeing most happily blended. The portrait is that of Emmanuel Swedenborg,\r\nthe great scholar and spiritual divine. The reader will observe how high\r\nand symmetrical is the forehead, and how well balanced appears the\r\nentire organization. He was remarkable for vivid imagination, great\r\nscientific acquirements, and all his writings characterize him as a\r\nsubtle reasoner.\r\n\r\nWhen the encephalic predominates, and the sanguine is deficient in its\r\nelements, we find conditions favorable to _waste_ and _expenditure_, and\r\nadverse to a generous _supply_ and _reformation_ of the tissues. A child\r\ninheriting this cerebral development is already top-heavy, and supports,\r\nat an immense disadvantage, this disproportionate organization. The\r\nnutritive functions are overbalanced; consequently there is a\r\npredisposition to scrofulous diseases and disorders of the blood,\r\nvarious degenerating changes taking place in its composition; loss of\r\nred corpuscles, signified by shortness of breath; morbid changes,\r\nmanifested by cutaneous eruptions; exhaustion from lack of nourishment,\r\netc., until, finally, consumption finishes the subject.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 95.]\r\n\r\nHarmony is the support of all institutions, and applies with special\r\ncogency to the maintenance of health. When the mind dwells on one\r\nsubject to the exclusion of all others, we call such a condition\r\nmonomania. If we have an excessive development of mind, and deficient\r\nsupport of body, the result is corporeal derangement. It is unfortunate\r\nfor any child to inherit unusually large brain endowments, unless he is\r\npossessed of a vigorous, robust constitution. Such training should be\r\ndirected to that body as will encourage it to grow strong, hearty, and\r\nthrifty, and enable it to support the cerebral functions. The mental\r\nproclivities should be checked and the physical organization cultivated,\r\nto insure to such a child good health. Cut off all unnecessary\r\nbrain-wastes, attend to muscular training and such invigorating games\r\nand exercises as encourage the circulation of the blood; keep the skin\r\nclean and its functions active, the body warm and well protected, the\r\nlungs supplied with pure air, the stomach furnished, with wholesome\r\nfood, besides have the child take plenty of sleep to invigorate the\r\nsystem, and thus, by regular habits, maintain that equilibrium which\r\ntends to wholesome efficiency and healthful endurance.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSMISSION OF LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs has been already stated in the chapter on Biology, reproduction of\r\nthe species depends upon the union of a sperm-cell with a germ-cell, the\r\nmale furnishing the former and the female the latter. It is a well-known\r\nfact that the marriage of persons having dissimilar temperaments is more\r\nlikely to be fertile than the union of persons of the same temperaments;\r\nconsanguineous marriages, or the union of persons nearly related by\r\nblood, diminish fertility and the vigor of the offspring. Upon this\r\nsubject Francis Galton has given some very interesting historical\r\nillustrations in his well-known work, entitled \"Hereditary Genius.\" The\r\nhalf-brother of Alexander the Great, Ptolemy I, King of Egypt, had\r\ntwelve descendants, who successively became kings of that country, and\r\nwho were also called Ptolemy. They were matched in and in, but in nearly\r\nevery case these near marriages were unprolific and the inheritance\r\ngenerally passed through other wives. Ptolemy II married his niece, and\r\nafterwards his sister; Ptolemy IV married his sister. Ptolemy VI and VII\r\nwere brothers, and they both consecutively married the same sister;\r\nPtolemy VII also subsequently married his niece; Ptolemy VIII married\r\ntwo of his sisters in succession. Ptolemy XII and XIII were brothers,\r\nand both consecutively married their sister, Cleopatra. Mr. Galton and\r\nSir Jas. Y. Simpson have shown that many peerages have become extinct\r\nthrough the evil results of inter-marriage. Heiresses are usually only\r\nchildren, the feeble product of a run-out stock, and statistics have\r\nshown that one-fifth of them bear no children, and fully one-third never\r\nbear more than one child. Sir J.Y. Simpson ascertained that out of 495\r\nmarriages in the British Peerage, 81 were unfruitful, or nearly one in\r\nevery six; while out of 675 marriages among an agricultural and\r\nseafaring population, only 65 were sterile or barren, or a little less\r\nthan one in ten.\r\n\r\nWhile the marriages of persons closely related, or of similar\r\ntemperaments are frequently unfruitful, we would not have the reader\r\nunderstand that sterility, or barrenness, is usually the result of such\r\nunions. It is most frequently due to some deformity or diseased\r\ncondition of the generative organs of the female. In the latter part of\r\nthis work may be found a minute description of the conditions which\r\ncause barrenness, together with the methods of treatment, which have\r\nproved most effectual in the extensive practice at the Invalids' Hotel\r\nand Surgical Institute.\r\n\r\nThe temperaments may be compared to a magnet, _the like poles of which\r\nrepel, and the unlike poles of which attract each other._ Thus\r\nsimilarity of temperament results in barrenness while dissimilarity\r\nmakes the vital magnetism all the more powerful. Marriageable persons\r\nmoved by some unknown influence, have been drawn instinctively toward\r\neach other, have taken upon themselves the vows and obligations of\r\nwedlock, and have been fruitful and happy in this relation. Alliances\r\nfounded upon position, money, or purely arbitrary considerations, mere\r\ncontracts of convenience, are very apt to prove unhappy and\r\nunproductive.\r\n\r\nMen may unconsciously obey strong instinctive impulses without being\r\nconscious of their existence, and by doing so, avoid those ills, which\r\notherwise might destroy their connubial happiness. The _philosophy_ of\r\nmarriage receives no consideration, because the mind is pre-occupied\r\nwith newly awakened thoughts and feelings. Lovers are charmed by certain\r\nharmonies, feel interior persuasions, respond to a new magnetic\r\ninfluence and are lost in an excess of rapture.\r\n\r\nIf the parties to a marriage are evenly balanced in organic elements,\r\nalthough both of them are vigorous, yet it is physiologically more\r\nsuitable for them to form a nuptial alliance with an unlike combination.\r\nThe cause of the wretchedness attending many marriages may be traced to\r\na too great similarity of organization, ideas, taste, education,\r\npursuits, and association, which similarity almost invariably terminates\r\nin domestic unhappiness. The husband and wife should be as different as\r\nthe positive and negative poles of a magnet. When life is begotten under\r\nthese circumstances we may expect a development bright with\r\nintelligence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nMARRIAGE.\r\n\r\nLOVE.\r\n\r\n    \"Love is the root of creation; God's essence; worlds without number\r\n    Lie in his bosom like children; he made them for this purpose only.\r\n    Only to love and to be loved again, he breathed forth his spirit\r\n    Into the slumbering dust, and upright standing, it laid its\r\n    Hand on its heart, and felt it was warm with a flame out of heaven.\"\r\n\r\n        --LONGFELLOW.\r\n\r\n\r\nLove, that tender, inexplicable feeling which is the germinal essence of\r\nthe human spirit, is the rudimental element of the human soul. It is,\r\ntherefore, a Divine gift, a blessing which the Creator did not withdraw\r\nfrom his erring children, when they were driven from a paradise of\r\ninnocence and loveliness into a world of desolation and strife. He left\r\nit as an invisible cord by which to draw the human heart ever upward, to\r\na brighter home--the heavenly Eden. Love is the very essence of Divine\r\nlaw, the source of inspiration, even the fountain of life itself. It is\r\nspontaneous, generous, infinite. To its presence we are indebted for all\r\nthat is good, true, and beautiful in Art and Nature. It endows humanity\r\nwith countless virtues, and throws a mystic veil over our many faults.\r\nIt is this feeling, this immutable law, which controls the destiny of\r\nthe race. From its influence empires have fallen, scepters have been\r\nlost. Literature owes to Love its choicest gems. The poet's lay is\r\nsweeter when Cupid tunes the lyre. The artist's brush is truer when\r\nguided by Love. Greece was the cradle of letters and art. Her daughters\r\nwere queens of beauty, fitted to inspire the Love of her noblest sons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 96.]\r\n\r\nThe materialism of the nineteenth century has sought to degrade Love; to\r\ndefine it as purely physical. The result has been a corresponding\r\ndegradation of art, and even literature has lost much of its lofty\r\nidealism. Nudity has become a synonym of vulgarity; Love, of lust. \"Evil\r\nbe to him who evil thinks.\" True Love never seeks to degrade its object;\r\non the contrary, it magnifies every virtue, endows it with divinest\r\nattributes, and guards its chastity, or honor, at the sacrifice of its\r\nown life. It increases benevolence by opening the lover's heart to the\r\nwants of suffering humanity. Ideality is the canvas, and imagination the\r\nbrush with which Love delineates the beauties of the adored. Love\r\nheightens spirituality, awakens hope, strengthens faith, and enhances\r\ndevotion. It quickens the perceptions, intensifies the sensibilities,\r\nand redoubles the memory. It augments muscular activity, and imparts\r\ngrace to every movement. The desire to love and to be loved is innate,\r\nand forms as much a part of our being as bone or reason. In fact, Love\r\nmay be considered as the very foundation of our spiritual existence, as\r\nbone and reason are the essential bases of our physical and intellectual\r\nbeing. Every man or woman feels the influence of this emotion, sooner or\r\nlater. It is the Kadesh-barnea of human existence; obedience to its\r\nintuitions insures the richest blessings of life, while neglect or\r\nperversion enkindles God's wrath, even as did the disobedience of the\r\nwandering Israelites.\r\n\r\nThe one great fact which pervades the universe is _action_. The very\r\nexistence of Love demands its activity, and, hence, the highest\r\nhappiness is attained by a normal and legitimate development of this\r\nelement of our being. The heart demands an object upon which to lavish\r\nthe largess of its affection. In the absence of all others, a star, a\r\nflower, or even a bird, will receive this homage. The bird warbles a gay\r\nanswer to the well-known voice, the flower repays the careful cultivator\r\nby displaying its richest tints, the star twinkles a bright \"good\r\nevening\" to the lonely watcher, and yet withal there is an unsatisfied\r\nlonging in the lover's heart, to which neither can respond; the desire\r\nto be loved! Hence, the perfect peace of reciprocated love. If its laws\r\nare violated, nature seeks revenge in the utter depression or\r\nprostration of the vital energies. Thus has the Divine Law-giver\r\nengraven His command on our very being. To love is, therefore, a duty,\r\nthe fulfillment of which should engage our noblest powers.\r\n\r\nThis emotion manifests itself in several phases, prominent among which\r\nis filial affection, the natural harmonizer of society. Paternal love\r\nincludes a new element--protection. Greater than either, and second only\r\nin fortitude to maternal affection, is\r\n\r\n\r\nCONJUGAL LOVE.\r\n\r\n    \"He is blest in Love alone\r\n    Who loves for years and loves but one.\"--HUNT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith Swedenborg, we may assert, \"_that there is given love truly\r\nconjugal, which at this day is so rare, that it is not known what it is,\r\nand scarce that it is_.\" The same author has defined this relation to be\r\na union of Love and Wisdom. The fundamental law of conjugal love is\r\n_fidelity to one love_. God created but one Eve, and the essential\r\nelements of paternal and maternal love pre-suppose and necessitate, for\r\ntheir normal development, the Love of _one_ only. Again, Love is the sun\r\nof woman's existence. Only under its influence does she unfold the\r\nnoblest powers of her being. Woman's intuitions should therefore be\r\ntaken as the true love-gauge. If she desire a plurality of loves, it\r\nmust be a law of her nature; but is communism the desire of our wives\r\nand daughters? No! Every act which renders woman dear to us, denounces\r\nsuch an idea and reveals the exclusive sacredness of her Love. As\r\ncondemning promiscuity in this relation, we may cite the lovers' pledges\r\nand oaths of fidelity, the self-perpetuity of Love itself, the common\r\ninstincts of mankind, as embodied in public sentiment, and the inherent\r\nconsciousness that first love should he kept inviolable forever. Again,\r\nLove is conservative. It clings tenaciously to all the memories\r\nconnected with its first object. The scenes consecrated to \"Love's young\r\ndream\" are sacred to every heart. The woodland with its winding paths\r\nand arbors, the streamlet bordered with drooping violets and dreamy\r\npimpernel, the clouds, and even \"the very tones in which we spoke,\" are\r\nindelibly imprinted on the memory. There is also the \"mine and thine\"\r\nintuition of love. This sentiment is displayed in every thought and act\r\nof the lover. Every pleasure is insipid unless shared by the beloved;\r\nselfish and exacting to all others, yet always generous and forgiving to\r\nthe adored. \"Mine and thine, dearest,\" is the language of Conjugal Love.\r\n\r\nThe consummation desired by all who experience this affection, is the\r\nunion of souls in a true marriage. Whatever of beauty or romance there\r\nmay be in the lover's dream, is enhanced and spiritualized in the\r\nintimate communion of married life. The crown of wifehood and maternity\r\nis purer, more divine, than that of the maiden. Passion is lost; the\r\nemotions predominate.\r\n\r\nThe connubial relation is not an institution; it was born of the\r\nnecessities and desires of our nature. \"It is not good for man to be\r\nalone,\" was the Divine judgment, and so God created for him \"an\r\nhelpmate.\" Again, \"Male and female created He them;\" therefore, sex is\r\nas divine as the soul. It is often perverted, but so is reason, aye, so\r\nis devotion.\r\n\r\nThe consummation of marriage involves the mightiest issues of life. It\r\nmay be the source of infinite happiness or the seal of a living death.\r\n\"Love is blind\" is an old saying, verified by thousands of ill-assorted\r\nunions. Many unhappy marriages are traceable to one or both of two\r\nsources, Physical Weaknesses and Masquerading. Many are the candidates\r\nfor marriage who are rendered unfit therefor from weaknesses of their\r\nsexual systems, induced by the violation of well-established physical\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\nWe cannot too strongly urge upon parents and guardians the imperative\r\nduty of teaching those youths who look to them for instruction, in all\r\nmatters which pertain to their future well-being such lessons as are\r\nembraced in the chapter of this book entitled, \"Hygiene of the\r\nReproductive Organs.\" By attending to such lessons as will give the\r\nchild a knowledge of the physiology and hygiene of his whole system, the\r\nerrors into which so many of the young fall, and much of the misery\r\nwhich is so often the dregs of the hymeneal cup, will be avoided.\r\n\r\nMasquerading is a modern accomplishment. Girls wear tight shoes,\r\nburdensome skirts, and corsets, all of which prove very injurious to\r\ntheir health. At the age of seventeen or eighteen, our young ladies are\r\nsorry specimens of womankind, and \"palpitators,\" cosmetics, and all the\r\nmodern paraphernalia of fashion are required to make them appear fresh\r\nand blooming. Man is equally to blame. A devotee to all the absurd\r\ndevices of fashion, he practically asserts that \"dress makes the man.\"\r\nBut physical deformities are of far less importance than moral\r\nimperfections. Frankness is indispensable in love. Each should know the\r\nother's faults and virtues. Marriage will certainly disclose them; the\r\nidol falls and the deceived lover is transformed into a cold, unloving\r\nhusband or wife. By far the greater number of unhappy marriages are\r\nattributable to this cause. In love especially, honesty is policy and\r\ntruth will triumph.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF MARRIAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLYGAMY AND MONOGAMY. We propose to give only a brief dissertation on\r\nthe principles and arguments of these systems, with special reference to\r\ntheir representatives in the nineteenth century. Polygamy has existed in\r\nall ages. It is, and always has been, the result of moral degradation or\r\nwantonness. The Garden of Eden was no harem. Primeval nature knew no\r\ncommunity of love. There was only the union of two \"and the twain were\r\nmade one flesh.\" Time passed; \"the sons of God saw the daughters of men\r\nthat they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.\"\r\nThe propensities of men were in the ascendant, and \"God repented Him\r\nthat He had created man.\" He directed Noah to take into the ark, two of\r\nevery sort, male and female. But \"the imagination of man's heart is evil\r\nfrom his youth,\" and tradition points to Polygamy as the generally\r\nrecognized form of marriage among the ancients. The father of the Hebrew\r\nnation was unquestionably a polygamist, and the general history of\r\npatriarchal life shows that a plurality of wives and concubines were\r\nnational customs. In the earlier part of Egyptian history, Menes is said\r\nto have founded a system of marriage, ostensibly monogamous, but in\r\nreality it was polygamous, because it allowed concubinage. As\r\ncivilization advanced, the latter became unpopular, and \"although\r\nlawful, was uncommon,\" while polygamy was expressly forbidden. Solomon,\r\naccording to polygamous principles, with his thousand women, should have\r\nenjoyed a most felicitous condition. Strange that he exclaimed \"A woman\r\namong all these have I not found.\" According to the distinguished Rabbi,\r\nMaimonides, polygamy was a Jewish custom as late as the thirteenth\r\ncentury. When Cecrops the Egyptian King, came to Athens (1550, B.C.) he\r\nintroduced a new system, which proved to be another step toward the\r\nrecognition of Monogamy. Under this code a man was permitted to have one\r\nwife and a concubine. Here dawned the era of Grecian civilization, the\r\nglory of which was reflected in the social and political principles of\r\nWestern Europe. During the fourth and fifth centuries B.C., concubinage\r\ndisappeared, but, under the new regime, the condition of the wife was\r\ndegraded. She was regarded as simply an instrument of procreation and a\r\nmistress of the household, while a class of foreign women, who devoted\r\nthemselves to learning and the fine arts, were the admired, and often\r\nthe beloved companions of the husbands. These were the courtesans who\r\nplayed the same role in Athenian history, as did the chaste matron, in\r\nthe annals of Rome. When Greece became subject to Rome and the national\r\ncharacteristics of these nations were blended, marriage became a loose\r\nform of monogamy. In Persia, during the reign of Cyrus, about 560 B.C.,\r\npolygamy was sustained by custom, law, and religion. The Chinese\r\nmarriage system was, and is, practically polygamous, for, from their\r\nearliest traditions, we learn that although a man could have but one\r\nwife, he was permitted to have as many concubines as he desired.\r\n\r\nIn the Christian era the first religious system which incorporated\r\npolygamy as a principle was Mohammedanism. This system, which is so\r\nadmirably adapted to the voluptuous character of the Orientals, has\r\npenetrated Western Europe, Asia, and Africa. Hayward estimated the\r\nnumber of its adherents to be one hundred and forty millions. The heaven\r\nof the Mohammedan is replete with all the luxuries which appeal to the\r\nanimal propensities. Ravishing Houris attend the faithful, who recline\r\non downy couches, in pavilions of pearl. On the Western Continent a\r\nsystem of promiscuity was practiced by the Mexicans, Peruvians,\r\nBrazilians, and the barbarous tribes of North America.\r\n\r\nThe Mormon Church was founded by Joseph Smith, and professes to be in\r\nharmony with the Bible and a special revelation to its leading Saint.\r\nAccording to the Mormon code, \"Love is a yearning for a higher state of\r\nexistence, and the passions, properly understood, are feeders of the\r\nspiritual life;\" and again, \"nature is dual; to complete his\r\norganization a man must marry.\" The leading error of Mormonism is that\r\nit mistakes a legal permission for a Divine command. The Mormon logic\r\nmay be premised as follows: the Mosaic law allowed polygamy; the Bible\r\nrecords it; therefore, the Bible _teaches_ polygamy.\r\n\r\nA Mormon Saint can have not less than three wives but as many more as he\r\ncan conveniently support. The eight fundamental doctrines of the Mormon\r\nChurch are stated as follows: 1. God is a person with the flesh and form\r\nof a man. 2. Man is a part of the substance of God and will himself\r\nbecome a god. 3. Man is not created by God but existed from all\r\neternity. 4. Man is not born in sin, and is not accountable for offenses\r\nother than his own. 5. The earth is a colony of embodied spirits, one of\r\nmany such settlements in space. 6. God is president of the immortals,\r\nhaving under Him four orders of beings: (1.) Gods--_i.e._, immortal\r\nbeings, possessed of a perfect organization of soul and body, being the\r\nfinal state of men who have lived on earth in perfect obedience to the\r\nlaw. (2.) Angels, immortal beings who have lived on earth in imperfect\r\nobedience to the law. (3.) Men, immortal beings in whom a living soul is\r\nunited with a human body. (4.) Spirits, immortal beings, still waiting\r\nto receive their tabernacle of flesh. 7. Man, being one of the race of\r\ngods, became eligible, by means of marriage, for a celestial throne, and\r\nhis household of wives and children are his kingdom, not only on earth\r\nbut in heaven. 8. The kingdom of God has been again founded on earth,\r\nand the time has now come for the saints to take possession of their\r\nown; but by virtue, not by violence; by industry, not by force. This\r\nsect has met with stern and bitter opposition. It was successively\r\nlocated in New York, Ohio, Missouri, and Illinois, from the last of\r\nwhich it was expelled by force of arms, and in 1848 established in Utah.\r\nIts adherents number, at the present time, more than two hundred\r\nthousand.\r\n\r\nAnother organization, differing from the Mormons, in many of its radical\r\nprinciples, is that of the \"Communists,\" popularly termed \"Free Lovers.\"\r\nIt is located at Lennox, Madison Co., N.Y. Its members advocate a system\r\nof \"complex marriage\" which they claim is instituted with a\r\nconscientious regard for the welfare of posterity. They disclaim\r\n\"promiscuity,\" and assert that the tie which binds them together is as\r\npermanent and as sacred as that of marriage. Community of property is\r\ncommensurate with freedom of Love. They define love to be \"social\r\nappreciation,\" and this element in their code of civilization, which\r\nthey deem superior to all others, is secondary to \"bodily support.\" The\r\nprinciples upon which their social status is founded may be briefly\r\nsummarized as follows: \"Man offers woman support and love\r\n(unconditional). Woman enjoying freedom, self-respect, health, personal\r\nand mental competency, gives herself to man in the boundless sincerity\r\nof an unselfish union. State--, Communism.\" In this, as in all forms of\r\npolygamous marriages, love is made synonymous with sexuality, and its\r\npurely spiritual element is lost. In every instance this spiritual\r\nelement should constitute the basis of marriage, which, without it, is\r\nnothing more than legal prostitution. Without it, the selfish,\r\ndegrading, animal propensities run rampant, while the emotions with all\r\ntheir boundless sweetness lie dormant. Woman is regarded as only a\r\nplaything to gratify the animal caprice.\r\n\r\nThat Monogamy is a law of nature is evident from the fact that it\r\nfulfills the three essential conditions which form the basis of true\r\nmarriage: (1.) The development of the individual (2.) The welfare of\r\nsociety. (3.) The reproduction of the species.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF THE INDIVIDUAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYSICALLY. Reciprocated love produces a general exhilaration of the\r\nsystem. The elasticity of the muscles is increased, the circulation is\r\nquickened, and every bodily function is stimulated. The duties of life\r\nare performed with a zest and alacrity never before experienced. \"It is\r\nnot possible for human beings to attain their full stature of humanity,\r\nexcept by loving long and perfectly. Behold that venerable man! He is\r\nmature in judgment, perfect in every action and expression, and saintly\r\nin goodness. You almost worship as you behold. What rendered him thus\r\nperfect? What rounded off his natural asperities, and moulded up his\r\nvirtues? Love mainly. It permeated every pore, so to speak, and seasoned\r\nevery fiber of his being, as could nothing else. Mark that matronly\r\nwoman. In the bosom of her family, she is more than a queen and goddess\r\ncombined. All her looks and actions express the outflowing of some or\r\nall of the human virtues. To know her is to love her. She became thus\r\nperfect, not in a day or a year, but by a long series of appropriate\r\nefforts. Then by what? Chiefly in and by love, which is specifically\r\nadapted thus to develope this maturity.\" But all this occurs only when\r\nthere is a normal exercise of the sexual propensities. Excessive\r\nindulgence in marital pleasures deadens all the higher faculties, love\r\nincluded, and results in an utter prostration of the bodily powers. The\r\nCreator has endowed man and woman with passions, the suppression of\r\nwhich leads to pain, their gratification to pleasure, their satiety to\r\ndisgust. Excessive marital indulgence produces abnormal conditions of\r\nthe generative organs and not unfrequently leads to incurable disease.\r\nMany cases of uterine disease are traceable to this cause.\r\n\r\nMORALLY AND INTELLECTUALLY. In no country where the polygamous system\r\nprevails do we find a code of political and social ethics which\r\nrecognizes the rights and claims of the individual. The condition of\r\nwoman is that of the basest slave, a slave to the caprice and tyranny of\r\nher master. Communism raises her from the slough of slavery, but\r\nsubjects her to the level of prostitution. An inevitable sequence of\r\npolygamy is a decline of literature and science. The natural tendency of\r\neach system is to _sensualism._, The blood is diverted from its normal\r\nchannels and the result is a condition which may be appropriately termed\r\n_mental starvation_. Sensualism is in its very nature directly opposed\r\nto literary attainments or advancement. Happily there is a golden mean,\r\nan equalization of those elements which constitutes the acme of\r\nindividual enjoyment.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WELFARE OF SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe general law of ethics, that \"whatever is beneficial to the\r\nindividual, contributed to the highest good of society and _vice\r\nversa_,\" applies with equal force to the hygienic conditions of\r\nmarriage. Each family, like the ancient Roman household, is the\r\nprototype of the natural government under which it lives. Wherever the\r\nmarriage relation is regarded as sacred, there you will find men of pure\r\nhearts and noble lives. Of all foreign nations the Germans are\r\ncelebrated for their sacred regard of woman, and the duties of marriage,\r\nand all scholars from the age of Tacitus to the present day, have\r\nconcurred in attributing the elevation of woman to the pure-minded\r\nTeutons. In America, the law recognizes only Monogamy; but domestic\r\nunhappiness is a prominent feature of our national life; therefore,\r\nargues the would-be free-lover, monogamy does not accord with the best\r\ninterests of mankind. The fallacy lies in the first premise. Legally,\r\nour marriage system is monogamous but _socially_ and _practically_ it is\r\n_not!_ Prostitution is the source of this domestic infelicity. The\r\n\"mistress\" sips the sweet nectar that is denied to the deceived wife.\r\nLegislators have battled with intemperance, but have done comparatively\r\nlittle to banish from our midst this necessary (?) evil. They recoil\r\nwith disgust from this abyss of iniquity and disease. Within it is\r\ncoiled a hydra-headed monster, which invades our hearthstones,\r\ncontaminates our social atmosphere, and whose very breath is laden with\r\npoisonous vapors, the inexhaustible source of all evil.\r\n\r\nThe perverted appetites of mankind are mistaken for the natural desires\r\nand necessities of our being; and, accordingly, various arguments have\r\nbeen advanced to prove that monogamy is not conducive to social\r\ndevelopement. It is curious that no one of these arguments refers to the\r\nhealth and well-being of the _individual_, thus overlooking, perhaps\r\nwillfully, the great law of social economy. Even a few medical writers\r\nsometimes advocate the principles of this so-called liberalism. In a\r\nrecently published work, there are enumerated only _two_ demerits of\r\npolygamy and _six_ of monogamy. These six demerits which the author is\r\npleased to term a \"bombshell,\" he introduces on account of his moral\r\nconvictions no less than humanitarian considerations. The same author\r\nterms monogamy a \"worm-eaten and rotten-rooted tree.\" The worm that is\r\ndevastating the fairest tree of Eden and draining its richest juices is\r\nwhat our contemporary thinks, may be \"_plausibly termed, a necessary\r\nevil_.\" It is claimed that monogamy begets narrow sympathies and leads\r\nto selfish idolatry. The fallacy of this argument lies in the\r\nmisapprehension of the term _selfishness_. Self-preservation is\r\nliterally selfishness, yet who will deny that it is a paramount duty of\r\nman. If perverted, it may be vicious, even criminal; but selfishness, in\r\nso far as it is generated by monogamy, is one of the chief elements of\r\nsocial economy; furthermore, it favors the observance of the laws of\r\nsexual hygiene. As we have said elsewhere, true love _increases\r\nbenevolence_, and correspondingly expands and develops the sympathies.\r\nSelfish idolatry is preferable to social neglect. This argument will not\r\nbear a critical examination; for it is asserted that in a happy union,\r\n\"love is so exclusive that there is hardly a liking for good neighbors,\r\nand scarcely any love at all for God.\" If the \"good neighbors\" were\r\nequally blessed, they would not suffer from this exclusiveness, and it\r\nis practically true that there is no higher incentive to love and obey\r\nour Maker than the blessing of a happy marriage.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PERPETUATION OF THE SPECIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe third essential object of marriage is the perpetuation of the\r\nspecies. The desire for offspring is innate in the heart of every true\r\nman or woman. It is thus a law of our nature, and, as such, must have\r\nits legitimate sphere. The essential features of reproduction proclaim\r\nmonogamy to be the true method of procreation. Promiscuity would render\r\nthe mother unable to designate the father of her children. Among lower\r\nanimals, pairing is an instinctive law whenever the female is incapable\r\nof protecting and nourishing her offspring alone. During at least\r\nfifteen years, the child is dependent for food and clothing upon its\r\nparents, to say nothing of the requisite moral training and loving\r\nsympathy, which, in a great measure, mould its character. Fidelity to\r\none promotes multiplication. It has been argued by the advocates of\r\npolygamy that such a system interferes with woman's natural right to\r\nmaternity. Of the many marriages celebrated yearly, comparatively few\r\nare sterile. The statement that many single women are desirous of having\r\nchildren, would apply only to a very limited number, as it is seldom\r\nthat they would be able to support children without the aid and\r\nassistance of a father. Promiscuity diminishes the number and\r\n_vitiates_, the quality of the human products. \"Women of pleasure never\r\ngive to the world sons of genius, or daughters of moral purity.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nREPRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery individual derives existence from a _parent_, which word literally\r\nmeans one who brings forth. We restrict the meaning of the term\r\n_reproduction_, ordinarily, to that function by which living bodies\r\nproduce other living bodies similar to themselves. _Production_ means to\r\nbring forth; _reproduction_, the producing again, or renewing. To\r\nprotract individual existence, nutrition is necessary, because all vital\r\nchanges are attended by _wear_ and _waste_. Nutrition is always engaged\r\nin the work of reparation. Every organism that starts out upon its\r\ncareer of development depends upon nourishing materials for its growth,\r\nand upon this renewing process for its development. Nutrition is all the\r\nwhile necessary to prolong the life of the individual, but at length its\r\nvigor wanes, its functions languish, and, finally, the light of earthly\r\nlife goes out. Although the single organization decays and passes away,\r\nnevertheless the species is uninterruptedly continued; the tidal wave of\r\nlife surges higher on the shores of time, for reproduction is as\r\nconstant and stable as the attractive forces of the planetary system.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact, that many species of the lower order of animals which once\r\nexisted are now extinct. It has been asserted and denied, that fossil\r\nremains of man have been found, indicating that races which once existed\r\nhave disappeared from the face of the earth. The pyramids are unfolding\r\na wonderful history, embracing a period of forty-five hundred years,\r\nwhich the world of science receives as literally authentic, and admits,\r\nalso, that fifty-four hundred years are _probably_ as correctly\r\naccounted for. The extinction of races is not at all improbable. At the\r\npresent time, the aboriginal inhabitants of this continent seem to be\r\nsurely undergoing gradual extinguishment! It, therefore, seems to be\r\npossible for a weaker race to deteriorate, and finally become extinct,\r\nunless the causes of their decadence can be discovered and remedied. All\r\npeople are admonished to earnestly investigate the essential conditions\r\nnecessary for their continuance, for the rise and fall of nations is in\r\nobedience to natural principles and operations. Viewed from this\r\nstandpoint, it is possible that a careful study of the human\r\ntemperaments and their relations to reproduction may be of greater\r\nmoment than has hitherto been supposed, and a proper understanding of\r\nthem may tend to avert that individual deterioration, which, if suffered\r\nto become general, would end in national disaster and the extinction of\r\nthe race.\r\n\r\nUntil recently, even naturalists believed that descendants were strictly\r\nlike their parents in form and structure. Now it is known that the\r\nprogeny may differ in both form and structure from the parent, and that\r\nthese may produce others still more unlike their ancestry. But all these\r\npeculiar and incidental deviations finally return to the original form,\r\nshowing that these changes have definite limits, and that the\r\nalterations observe a specific variableness, which is finally completed\r\nby its assuming again the original form. (See page 16, Figs. 2 and 3).\r\n\r\n_Reproduction_ may be _sexual_ or _non-sexual._ In some plants and\r\nanimals it is non-sexual. The propagation of species is accomplished by\r\nbuds. Thus the gardener grafts a new variety of fruit upon an old stock.\r\nThe florist understands how to produce new varieties of flowers, and\r\nmake them radiantly beautiful in their bright and glowing colors. The\r\nbud personates the species and produces after its kind. Some of the\r\n_annelides_, a division of articulate animals, characterized by an\r\nelongated body, formed of numerous rings or annular segments, multiply\r\nby spontaneous division. A new head is formed at intervals in certain\r\nsegments of the body. (See Fig. 97).\r\n\r\nSomething similar to this process of budding, we find taking place in a\r\nlow order of animal organization. Divide the fresh water polyp into\r\nseveral pieces, and each one will grow into an entire animal. Each piece\r\nrepresents a polyp, and so each parent polyp is really a compound\r\nanimal, an organized community of beings. Just as the buds of a tree,\r\nwhen separated and engrafted upon another tree, grow again, each\r\npreserving its original identity, so do the several parts of this\r\nanimal, when divided, become individual polyps, capable of similar\r\nreproduction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 97.\r\nAn annelid dividing spontaneously, a new head having been formed toward the\r\nhinder part of the body of the parent.]\r\n\r\nThe revolving volvox likewise increases by growth until it becomes a\r\nsociety of animals, a multiple system of individuals. There are\r\napertures from the parent, by which water gains a free access to the\r\ninterior of the whole miniature series. This monad was once supposed to\r\nbe a single animal, but the microscope shows it to be a group of animals\r\nconnected by means of six processes, and each little growing volvox\r\nexhibits his red-eye speck and two long spines, or horns. These animals\r\nalso multiply by dividing, and thus liberate another series, which, in\r\ntheir turn, reproduce other groups.\r\n\r\nGeneration requires the concurrence of _stimuli_ and _susceptibility_,\r\nand, to perfect the process, two conditions are also necessary. The\r\nfirst is the sperm, which communicates the principle of action; the\r\nother is the germ, which receives the latent life and provides the\r\nconditions necessary to organic evolution. The vivifying function\r\nbelongs to the male, that of nourishing and cherishing is possessed by\r\nthe female; and these conditions are sexual distinctions. The former\r\nrepresents _will_ and _understanding_; the latter, _vitality_ and\r\n_emotion_. The father directs and controls, the mother fosters and\r\nencourages; the former counsels and admonishes, the latter persuades and\r\ncaresses; and their union in holy matrimony represents one; that is, the\r\nblending of vitality and energy, of love and wisdom,--the elements\r\nindispensable to the initiation of life under the dual conditions of\r\nmale and female,--_one in the functions of reproduction_.\r\n\r\nLet us consider the modes of Sexual Reproduction, which are\r\n_hermaphroditic_ and _dioecious_.\r\n\r\n\r\nHERMAPHRODITIC REPRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have said that two kinds of cells represent reproduction, namely,\r\nsperm and germ-cells. These may be furnished by different individuals,\r\nor both may be found in one. When both are found in the same individual,\r\nthe parent is said to be a _natural hermaphrodite_. A perfect\r\nhermaphrodite possesses the attributes of both male and female--uniting\r\nboth sexes in one individual. Natural hermaphroditic reproduction occurs\r\nonly among inferior classes of animals, and naturalists inform us that\r\nthere are a greater number of these than of the more perfect varieties.\r\nThese are found low in the scale of animal organization, and one\r\nindividual is able to propagate the species. In the oyster and ascidians\r\nno organs can be detected in the male, but in the female they are\r\ndeveloped. Polyps, sponges, and cystic entozoa, may also be included\r\namong hermaphrodites.\r\n\r\nIt is only very low organisms indeed in which it is a matter of\r\nindifference whether the united sperm-cells and germ-cells are those of\r\nthe same individual, or those of different individuals. In more\r\nelaborate structures and highly organized beings, the essential thing in\r\nfertilization is the union of these cells specially endowed by\r\n_different_ bodies, the unlikeness of derivation in these united\r\nreproductive centers being the desideratum for perpetuating life and\r\npower.\r\n\r\nIn other classes, as _entozoa_, there appear to be special provisions\r\nwhereby the sperm-cells and germ-cells may be united; _i.e._, the male\r\norgans are developed and so disposed as to fecundate the ova of the same\r\nindividual. Sexual and non-sexual modes of reproduction are illustrated\r\nby that well-defined group of marine invertebrate animals, called\r\n_cirripedia_ Fig. 98 represents one of this genus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 98.\r\nPollicipes Mitella.]\r\n\r\nSome of these are not only capable of self-impregnation, but likewise\r\nhave what are called _complemental males_ attache to some of the\r\nhermaphrodites. In the whole animal kingdom, it may be doubted if there\r\nexists another such class of rudimentary creatures as the parasitic\r\nmales, who possess neither mouth, stomach, thorax, nor abdomen. After\r\nexerting a peculiar sexual influence, they soon die and drop off; so\r\nthat in this class of animals may be found the sexual distinctions of\r\nmale, female, and perfect hermaphrodites.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 99.\r\nRotiferia; Brachionus Urceolaris;\r\nlargely magnified. ]\r\n\r\nThere is a class of wheel-animalcules termed _rotifera_, of which the\r\nrevolving volvox is one example. They have acquired this name on account\r\nof the apparent rotation of the disc-like organs which surround their\r\nmouths and are covered with _cilia_, or little hairs. They are minute\r\ncreatures, and can best be viewed with a microscope, although the larger\r\nforms may be seen without such assistance. They are widely diffused on\r\nthe surface of the earth, inhabit lakes as well as the ocean, and are\r\nfound in cold, temperate, and tropical climates. The rotifera were once\r\nsupposed to be hermaphrodites, but the existence of sexes in one species\r\nhas been clearly established. The male, however, is much smaller, and\r\nfar less developed than the female. In some of these species,\r\ngerm-cells, or eggs, are found, which do not require fecundation for\r\nreproduction or development, so that they belong to the non-sexual\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nThe third variety of hermaphrodites embraces those animals in which the\r\nmale organs are so disposed as not to fecundate the ova of the same\r\nbody, but require the co-operation of two individuals, notwithstanding\r\nthe co-existence in each of the organs of both sexes. Each in turn\r\nimpregnates the other. The common leech, earth-worm, and snail,\r\npropagate in this manner.\r\n\r\n_Unnatural hermaphrodism_ is characteristic of insects and crustaceans,\r\nin which the whole body indicates a neutral character, tending to\r\nexhibit the peculiarities of male or female, in proportion to the kind\r\nof sexual organs which predominates. Half of the body may be occupied by\r\nmale, the other half by female organs, and each half reflects its\r\npeculiar sexual characteristics. Some butterflies are dimidiate\r\nhermaphrodites; _i.e._ one side of the body has the form and color of\r\nthe male, the other the form and color of the female. The wings show by\r\ntheir color and appearance these sexual distinctions. The stag-beetle is\r\nalso an example. We have accounts of dimidiate hermaphrodite lobster,\r\nmale in one half and female in the other half of the body.\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous classes of higher animals, which have red blood, we\r\nhave heard of no well-authenticated instance of hermaphrodism, or the\r\ncomplete union of _all_ the reproductive organs in one individual. True,\r\nthe term _hermaphrodite_ is often applied to certain persons in whom\r\nthere is some malformation, deficiency, or excess, of the genital\r\norgans. These congenital deformities consisting of combined increase or\r\ndeficiency, supernumerary organs, or transposition of them, which\r\nusually render generation physically impossible, have been called\r\n_bisexual hermaphrodism_ and classed as monstrosities. We have many\r\npublished accounts of them, hence, further reference to them here is\r\nunnecessary. We would especially refer those readers who may desire to\r\nmake themselves further acquainted with this interesting subject, to the\r\nstandard physiological works of Flint, Foster, Carpenter, Bennett,\r\nDalton, and others equally eminent in this particular branch of science.\r\n\r\nCertain theories have been advanced concerning conditions which may\r\ninfluence the sex of the offspring. One is that the right ovary\r\nfurnishes the germs for males, the left for females that the right\r\ntesticle furnishes sperm capable of fecundating the germs of males, and\r\nthe left testicle, the germs of the left ovary, for females. That\r\nfecundation sometimes takes place from right to left and thus produces\r\nthese abnormal variations. We merely state the hypothesis, but do not\r\nregard it as accounting for the distinction of sex, or as causing\r\nmonstrosities, though it is somewhat plausible as a theory, and is not\r\neasily disproved. In the lower order of animals, as sheep and swine, one\r\nof the testicles has been removed, and there resulted afterward both\r\nmale and female progeny, so that the theory seems to lack facts for a\r\nfoundation.\r\n\r\nWe sometimes witness in the child excessive development, as five\r\nfingers, a large cranium, which results in dropsical effusion, or\r\ndeficient brain, as in idiots; sometimes a hand or arm is lacking, or\r\npossibly there is a dual connection, as in the case of the Siamese\r\ntwins; or, two heads united on one body. It is difficult to give any\r\nsatisfactory explanation of these abnormal developments. From age to\r\nage, the type is _constant_, and preserves a race-unity. The crossings\r\nof the races are only transient deviations, not capable of perpetuation,\r\nand quickly return again to the original stock. This force is\r\npersistent, for inasmuch as the individual represents the race, so does\r\nhis offspring represent the parental characteristics, in tastes,\r\nproclivities, and morals, as well as in organic resemblances. This\r\nconstancy is unaccountable, and more mysterious than the occasional\r\nmalformation of germs in the early period of foetal life. If to every\r\ndeviation from that original form and structure, which gives character\r\nto the productions of nature, we apply the term _monster_, we shall find\r\nbut very few, and from this whole class there will be a very small\r\nnumber indeed of _sexual_ malformations. If the sexes be deprived of the\r\ngenerative organs, they approach each other in disposition and\r\nappearance. All those who are partly male and partly female in their\r\norganization, unite, to a certain extent, the characteristics of both\r\nsexes. When the female loses her prolific powers, many of her sexual\r\npeculiarities and attractions wane.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIOECIOUS REPRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dioecious_ is a word derived from the Greek, and signifies _two\r\nhouseholds;_ hence, _dioecious reproduction_ is sexual generation by\r\nmale and female individuals. Each is distinguished by sexual\r\ncharacteristics. The male sexual organs are complete in one individual,\r\nand all the female organs belong to a separate feminine organization. In\r\nsome of the vertebrates, impregnation does not require sexual congress;\r\nin other words, fecundation may take place _externally_. The female fish\r\nof some species first deposits her ova, and afterwards the male swims to\r\nthat locality and fertilizes them with sperm.\r\n\r\nIn higher orders of animals, fecundation occurs _internally_, the\r\nconjunction of the sperm and germ cells requiring the conjugation of the\r\nmale and female sexual organs. The sperm-cells of the male furnish the\r\nquickening principle, which sets in play all the generative energies,\r\nwhile the germ-cell, susceptible to its vivifying presence, responds\r\nwith all the conditions necessary to evolution. The special laboratory\r\nwhich furnishes spermatic material is the _testes_, while the stroma of\r\nthe _ovaries_ contributes the germ-cell. Several different modes of\r\nreproducing are observed when fecundation occurs within the body, which\r\nvary according to the peculiarities and organization of the female.\r\n\r\nMODES OF DIOECIOUS REPRODUCTION.--A very familiar illustration of one\r\nmode is found in the common domestic fowl, the egg of which vivified\r\nwithin the ovarium, is afterward expelled and hatched by the simple\r\nagency of warmth. This mode of reproduction is called _oviparous\r\ngeneration_.\r\n\r\nThe ovaries, as well as all their latent germs, are _remarkably_\r\ninfluenced by the first fecundation. It seems to indicate monogamy as\r\nthe rule of higher sexual reproduction. The farmer understands that if\r\nhe wishes to materially improve his cows, the first offspring must be\r\nbegotten by a better, purer breed, and all that follow will be\r\nessentially benefited, even if not so well sired. Neither will the best\r\nblood exhibit its most desirable qualities in the calves whose mothers\r\nhave previously carried inferior stock. So that there are sexual\r\nante-natal influences which may deteriorate the quality of the progeny.\r\nThe Jews understood this principle, in the raising up of sons and\r\ndaughters unto a deceased brother. The fact that the sexual influence of\r\na previous conception is not lost, is illustrated when, in a second\r\nmarriage, the wife bears a son or daughter resembling bodily or\r\nmentally, or in both of these respects the former husband. This\r\nindicates a union for life by natural influences which never die out.\r\n\r\nWith some species of fish and reptiles, the egg is impregnated\r\ninternally, and the process of _laying_ commences immediately, but it\r\nproceeds so slowly through the excretory passages, that it is hatched\r\nand born alive. This is called _ovo-viviparous generation_.\r\n\r\nAs we rise in the scale of organization, animals are more completely\r\ndeveloped, and greater economy is displayed in their preservation. The\r\ngerm passes from the ovary into an organ prepared for its reception and\r\ngrowth, to which, after fecundation, it becomes attached, and where it\r\nremains until sufficiently developed to maintain respiratory life. This\r\norgan is called the _womb_, or _uterus_, and is peculiar to most\r\nmammalia. This mode of reproduction is termed _viviparous generation_.\r\n\r\nThe kangaroo and oppossum are provided with a pouch attached to the\r\nabdomen, which receives the young born at an early stage of development.\r\nThey remain in contact with the mammæ, from which they obtain their\r\nnourishment, until their growth is sufficiently completed to maintain an\r\nindependent existence. This is called _marsupial generation_. The\r\nvariety of reproduction which is most interesting, is that of the human\r\nspecies, and is called _viviparous generation_. It includes the\r\nfunctions of copulation, fecundation, gestation, parturition, and\r\nlactation.\r\n\r\nFor the full and perfect development of mankind, both mental and\r\nphysical chastity is necessary. The health demands abstinence from\r\nunlawful intercourse. Therefore children should not be allowed to read\r\nimpure works of fiction, which tend to inflame the mind and excite the\r\npassions. Only in total abstinence from illicit pleasures is there moral\r\nsafety and health, while integrity, peace, and happiness, are the\r\nconscious rewards of virtue. Impurity travels downward with\r\nintemperance, obscenity, and corrupting diseases, to degradation and\r\ndeath. A dissolute, licentious, free-and-easy life is filled with the\r\ndregs of human suffering, iniquity, and despair. The penalties which\r\nfollow a violation of the law of chastity are found to be severe and\r\nswiftly retributive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 100.\r\nMale]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 101.\r\nFemale]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 102.\r\nOutline of the Female Urinary and\r\nGenerative Organs.]\r\n\r\nThe union of the sexes in holy matrimony is a law of nature finding\r\nsanction in both morals and legislation. Even some of the lower animals\r\nunite in this union for life, and instinctively observe the law of\r\nconjugal fidelity with a consistency which might put to blush other\r\nanimals more highly endowed. It is important to discuss this subject and\r\nunderstand our social evils, as well as the unnatural desires of the\r\nsexes, which must be controlled or they lead to ruin. Sexual\r\npropensities are possessed by all, and they must be held in abeyance,\r\nuntil they are exercised for legitimate purposes. Hence parents ought to\r\nunderstand the value of mental and physical labor to elevate and\r\nstrengthen the intellectual and moral faculties of their children, to\r\ndevelop the muscular system and direct the energies of the blood into\r\nhealthful channels. Vigorous employment of mind and body engrosses the\r\nvital energies and diverts them from undue excitement of the sexual\r\ndesires.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 103.\r\nOutline of the Male Reproductive Organs.]\r\n\r\nSexual generation by pairing individuals is the most economical mode of\r\npropagating the species. The lower orders of animals possess wonderful\r\nmultiplicative powers and their faculty for reproduction is offset by\r\nvarious destructive forces. The increased ability for self-maintenance\r\nimplies diminished reproductive energy; hence the necessity for greater\r\neconomy and safety in rearing the young. As certain larvae and insects\r\nincrease, the birds which feed upon them become more numerous. When this\r\nmeans of support becomes inadequate, these same birds diminish in number\r\nin proportion to the scarcity of their food. Many have remarked that\r\nvery prolific seasons are followed by unusual mortality, just as periods\r\nof uncommon prosperity precede those of severe disaster.\r\n\r\nThe increased mental and moral cultivation of mankind imposes upon them\r\nthe necessity for greater physical culture. \"Wiser and weaker,\" is a\r\ntrite saying, and means that the exercise of the higher nature discloses\r\nthe equivalent necessity of culturing the body, in order to support the\r\nincreasing expenditures of the former. Mental and moral discipline are\r\nessential for a proper understanding how to provide for the body, for\r\nphysical training increases the capacity of the individual for\r\nself-preservation. Constant vigilance is the price of health as well as\r\nof liberty.\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting physiological fact that, while the growth and\r\ndevelopment of the individual are rapidly progressing, the reproductive\r\npowers remain almost inactive, and that the commencement of reproduction\r\nnot only indicates an arrest of growth, but, in a great measure,\r\ncontributes toward it. From infancy to puberty, the body and its\r\nindividual organs, structurally as well as functionally, are in a state\r\nof gradual and progressive evolution. Men and women generally increase\r\nin stature until the twenty-fifth year, and it is safe to assume that\r\nperfection of function is not established until maturity of bodily\r\ndevelopment is completed. Solidity and strength are represented in the\r\norganization of the male, grace, and beauty in that of the female. His\r\nbroad shoulders represent physical power and the right of dominion,\r\nwhile her bosom is the symbol of love and nutrition. The father\r\nencounters hardships, struggles against difficulties, and braves dangers\r\nto provide for his household; the mother tenderly supplies the infant's\r\nwants, finding relief and pleasure in imparting nourishment, and\r\nsurrounds helpless infancy with an affection which is unwearied in its\r\ncountless ministering attentions. Her maternal functions are indicated\r\nby greater breadth of the hips. Physical differences so influence their\r\nmental natures, that, \"before experience has opened their eyes, the\r\ndreams of the young man and maiden differ.\" The development of either is\r\nin close sympathy with their organs of reproduction. Any defect of the\r\nlatter impairs our fair ideal, and detracts from those qualities which\r\nimpart excellence, and crown the character with perfections. Plainly has\r\nNature marked out, in the organization, very different offices to be\r\nperformed by the sexes, and has made these distinctions fundamental.\r\n\r\nLikewise, Nature expresses the intention of reproduction by giving to\r\nplants and animals distinctive organs for this purpose. These are\r\nendowed with exquisite sensibility, so that their proper exercise\r\nproduces enjoyment beneficial to both. Excessive sexual indulgence not\r\nonly prostrates the nervous system, enfeebles the body, and drains the\r\nblood of its vivifying elements, but is inconsistent with intellectual\r\nactivity, morality, and spiritual development. The most entrancing\r\ndelights and consummate enjoyments are of the emotive order, ideal,\r\nabstract, and pure, so inspiring that they overpower the grosser sensual\r\npleasures and diffuse their own sweet chastity and refining influence\r\nover all the processes of life.\r\n\r\nHence, the gratification of the sexual instincts should always be\r\nmoderate. It should be regulated by the judgment and will, and kept\r\nwithin the bounds of health. No person has a moral right to carry this\r\nindulgence so far as to produce injurious consequences to either party,\r\nand he who cannot refrain from it is in no proper condition to propagate\r\nhis species. In all culture there must be self-control, and the practice\r\nof self-denial at the command of love and justice is always a virtue.\r\nSelf-government is the polity of our people, and we point with pride and\r\nlaudable exultation to our political maxims, laws, and free\r\ninstitutions. The family is the prototype of society. If self-restraint\r\nbe practiced in the marital relation, then the principle of self-control\r\nwill carry health, strength, and morality into all parts of the\r\ncommonwealth. The leading characteristics of any nation are but the\r\nreflection of the traits of its individual members, and thus the family\r\ntruly typifies the practical morality and enduring character of a\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\nOVULATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Ovaries_ are those essential parts of the generative system of the\r\nhuman female in which the ova are matured. There are two ovaries, one on\r\neach side of the uterus, and connected with it by the Fallopian tubes;\r\nthey are ovoidal bodies about an inch in diameter, and furnish the\r\n_germs_ or ovules. These latter are very minute, seldom measuring 1/120\r\nof an inch in diameter, and frequently are not more than half that size.\r\nThe ovaries develop with the growth of the female, so that, finally, at\r\nthe pubescent period, they ripen and liberate an ovum, or germ vesicle,\r\nwhich is carried into the uterine cavity through the Fallopian tubes.\r\nWith the aid of the microscope, we find that these ova are composed of\r\ngranular substance, in which is found a miniature yolk surrounded by a\r\ntransparent membrane, called the _zona pellucida_. This yolk contains a\r\ngerminal vesicle in which can be discovered a nucleus, called the\r\n_germinal spot_. The process of the growth of the ovaries is very\r\ngradual, and their function of ripening and discharging an ovum every\r\nmonth into the Fallopian tubes and uterus is not developed until between\r\nthe twelfth and fifteenth years.\r\n\r\nThis period, which indicates, by the feelings and ideas, the desires and\r\nwill, that the subjects are capable of procreation, is called _puberty_.\r\nThe mind acquires new and more delicate perceptions, the person becomes\r\nplumper, the mammæ enlarge, and there is grace and perfection in every\r\nmovement, a conscious completeness for those relations of life for which\r\nthis function prepares them. The period of puberty is also indicated by\r\n\r\n\r\nMENSTRUATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe catamenial discharge naturally follows the ripening and liberation\r\nof an ovum, and as the ovaries furnish one of these each month, this\r\nmonthly flow is termed the _menses_ (the plural of the Latin word\r\n_mensis_, which signifies a month). The menstrual flow continues from\r\nthree to five days, and is merely the exudation of ordinary venous blood\r\nthrough the mucous lining of the cavity of the uterus. At this time, the\r\nnervous system of females is much more sensitive, and from the fact that\r\nthere is greater aptitude to conception immediately before and after\r\nthis period, it is supposed that the sexual feeling is then the\r\nstrongest. When impregnation occurs immediately before the appearance of\r\nthe menses, their duration is generally shortened, but not sufficiently\r\nto establish the suspicion that conception has taken place. The germ is\r\nthe contribution of the female, which provides the conditions which only\r\nrequire the vivifying principle of the sperm for the development of\r\nanother being. The period of aptitude for conception terminates at the\r\ntime both ovulation and menstruation cease, which, unless brought about\r\nearlier by disease, usually occurs about the forty-fifth year of her\r\nage.\r\n\r\n\r\nFECUNDATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince in the beginning God created male and female, and said unto them,\r\n\"Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth,\" it is evident that\r\nwhat was originated by creation must be continued by procreation. The\r\nprocess of generation the reader will find described on pages 12 and 13.\r\nThen commences a wonderful series of transforming operations,\r\nrudimentary changes preliminary to the formation of tissues, structures\r\nand functions, which finally qualify the organism for independent\r\nexistence. The ovum, when expelled from the ovary, enters the\r\nfimbriated, or fringe-like extremity of the Fallopian tube, to commence\r\nat once its descent to the uterus. The process of passing through this\r\nminute tube varies in different animals. In birds and reptiles, the bulk\r\nof the expelled ova is so great as to completely fill up the tube, and\r\nit is assisted in its downward course, partly by its own weight and\r\npartly by the peristaltic action of the muscular coat of the canal. In\r\nthe human subject, however, the ova are so minute that nature has\r\nsupplied a special agent for their direct transmission; otherwise they\r\nmight be retained, and not reach their destination. Accordingly, the\r\nfimbriated, trumpet-shaped extremity of the Fallopian tubes, which is\r\nnearest to the ovaries, and, consequently from the ovary first receives\r\nthe ovum when expelled; is provided with a series of small hairs, termed\r\n_cilia_, forming the lining or basement membrane of the tubes, and, the\r\nmovements of these cilia being towards the uterus, transmit, by their\r\nvibrating motion, the ovum from the ovary, through the Fallopian tubes,\r\nto the uterus.\r\n\r\nThe mature ovum, however, is not by itself capable of being converted\r\ninto the embryo. It requires fecundation by the spermatic fluid of the\r\nmale, and this may take place immediately on the expulsion of the ovum\r\nfrom the ovary, or during its passage through the Fallopian tube, or,\r\naccording to Bischoff, Coste, and others, in the cavity of the uterus,\r\nor even upon the surface of the ovary. Should impregnation, however,\r\nfail, the ovum gradually loses its vitality, and is eventually expelled\r\nby the uterine secretions. It occasionally happens that the descent of\r\nthe impregnated ovum is arrested, and the formation of the embryo\r\ncommences in the ovary. This is termed _ovarian pregnancy_. Or again,\r\nthe ovum may be arrested in its passage through the Fallopian tube,\r\ncausing what is termed _tubal pregnancy_; or, after it has been expelled\r\nfrom the ovary, it may fail to be received by the fimbriated extremity,\r\nand escape into the cavity of the abdomen, forming what has been termed\r\n_ventral pregnancy_. If the microscopic germ lodges in some slight\r\ninterstice of fiber, during its passage through the walls of the uterus,\r\nit may be detained long enough to fix itself there, and when this\r\noccurs, it is termed _interstitial pregnancy_. All these instances of\r\nextra-uterine pregnancy may necessitate the employment of surgical\r\nskill, in order that they may terminate with safety to the mother. Their\r\noccurrence, however, is very rare.\r\n\r\nThe intense nervous excitement produced by the act of coition is\r\nimmediately followed by a corresponding degree of depression, and a too\r\nfrequent repetition of it is necessarily injurious to health. The\r\nsecretions of the seminal fluid being, like other secretions, chiefly\r\nunder the influence of the nervous system, an expenditure of them\r\nrequires a corresponding renewal. This renewal greatly taxes the\r\ncorporeal powers, inducing lassitude, nervousness, and debility. It is a\r\nwell known fact that the highest degree of mental and bodily vigor is\r\ninconsistent with more than a moderate indulgence in sexual intercourse.\r\n\r\nTo ensure strength, symmetry, and high intellectual culture in the human\r\nrace, requires considerable care. Consideration should be exercised in\r\nthe choice of a companion for life. Constitutional as well as hereditary\r\nailments demand our closest attention. Age has also its judicious\r\nbarriers. As before stated, when reproduction commences, growth, as a\r\nrule, ceases, therefore, it is inexpedient that matrimony should be\r\nconsummated before the parties have arrived at mature stature.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREVENTION OF CONCEPTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nMuch has been written upon the question whether married people have a\r\nright to decline the responsibilities of wedlock. The practice of\r\ninducing abortion is not only immoral but criminal, because it is\r\ndestructive to both the health of the mother and the life of the embryo\r\nbeing. If both the parties to a marriage be feeble, or if they be not\r\ntemperamentally adapted to each other, so that their children would be\r\ndeformed, insane, or idiotic, then to beget offspring would be a\r\nflagrant wrong. If the mother is already delicate, possessing feeble\r\nconstitutional powers, she is inadequate to the duties of maternity,\r\n_and it is not right to lay such burdens upon her_. Self-preservation is\r\nthe first law of nature, which all ought to respect. The woman may be\r\nable to discharge the duties of a loving wife and companion, when she\r\ncannot fulfill those of child-bearing. If the husband love his wife as\r\nhe ought, he will resign all the pleasure necessary to secure her\r\nexemption from the condition of maternity. It seems to us, that it is a\r\ngreat wickedness, unpardonable even, to be so reckless of consequences,\r\nand so devoid of all feeling, as to expose a frail, feeble, affectionate\r\nwoman to those perils which almost insure her death. To enforce\r\npregnancy under such circumstances is a crime. Every true man,\r\ntherefore, should rather practice self-control and forbearance, than\r\nentail on his wife such certain misery, if not danger to life.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, the trial is great, but if a sacrifice be required, let the\r\nhusband forbear the gratification of passions which will assuredly be\r\nthe means of developing in his delicate wife symptoms that may speedily\r\nhurry her into a premature grave. Before she has recovered from the\r\neffects of bearing, nursing, and rearing one child, ere she has regained\r\nproper tone and vigor of body and mind, she is unexpectedly overtaken,\r\n_surprised_ by the manifestation of symptoms which again indicate\r\npregnancy. Children thus begotten are not apt to be hardy and\r\nlong-lived. From the love that parents feel for their posterity, from\r\ntheir wishes for their success, from their hopes that they may be useful\r\nfrom every consideration for their future well-being, let them exercise\r\nprecaution and forbearance, until the wife becomes sufficiently healthy\r\nand enduring to bequeath her own vital stamina to the child she bears.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said on this subject, it behooves the prudent husband\r\nto weigh well the injurious, nay criminal results which may follow his\r\nlust. Let him not endanger the health, and it may be the life, of his\r\nloving and confiding wife through a lack of self-denial. Let him\r\naltogether refrain, rather than be the means of untold misery and,\r\nperhaps, the destruction of the person demanding his most cherished love\r\nand protection. On so important a subject, we feel we should commit an\r\nunpardonable wrong were we not to speak thus plainly and openly. An\r\nopportunity has been afforded us, which it would be reprehensible to\r\nneglect. We shall indeed feel we have been amply rewarded, if these\r\nsuggestive remarks of ours tend in any way to remove or alleviate the\r\nsufferings of an uncomplaining and loving wife. Our sympathies, always\r\nsusceptible to the conditions of sorrow and suffering, have been\r\nenlisted to give faithfully, explicitly, and plainly, warnings of danger\r\nand exhortations to prudence and nothing remains for us but to maintain\r\nthe principles of morality, and leave to the disposal of a wise and\r\noverruling Providence the mystery of all seemingly untoward events. In\r\nevery condition of life, evils arise, and most of those which are\r\nencountered are avoidable. Humanity should be held accountable for those\r\nevils which it might, but does not shun.\r\n\r\nBy a statute of the national government, prevention of pregnancy is\r\nconsidered a punishable offense; whereas every physician is instructed\r\nby our standard writers and lecturers on this subject, that not only\r\nprevention is necessary in many instances, but even abortion must\r\nsometimes be produced in order to save the mother's life. As we view the\r\nmatter, the law of the national government asserts the ruling principle,\r\nand the exceptions to it must be well established by evidence, in order\r\nto fully justify such procedure. The family physician may, with the\r\nconcurrence of other medical counselors, be justified, in rare cases, in\r\nadvising means for the prevention of conception, but he should exercise\r\nthis professional duty _only_ when the responsibility is shared by other\r\nmembers of the profession, and the circumstances fully and clearly\r\nwarrant such a practice.\r\n\r\nAfter fecundation, the length of time before conception takes place is\r\nvariously estimated. Should impregnation occur at the ovary or within\r\nthe Fallopian tubes, usually about a week elapses before the fertilized\r\ngerm enters the uterus, so that ordinarily the interval between the act\r\nof insemination and that of conception varies from eight to fourteen\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOUBLE CONCEPTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf two germs be evolved simultaneously, each may be impregnated by\r\nspermatozoa, and a twin pregnancy be the result. This is by no means a\r\nrare occurrence. It is very unusual, however, to have one birth followed\r\nby another after an interval of three or four months, and each babe\r\npresent the evidences of full maturity. Perhaps such occurrences may be\r\naccounted for on the supposition that the same interval of time elapses\r\nbetween the impregnation of the two germs as there is difference\r\nobserved in their birth; that after the act of insemination, sperm was\r\ncarried to each ovary; that one had matured a germ ready for\r\nfecundation, then impregnation and conception immediately followed, and\r\nthe decidua of the uterus hermetically sealed both Fallopian tubes, and\r\nthus securely retained the sperm within the other Fallopian canal. The\r\nstimulus of the sperm so pent up causes that ovary to mature a germ,\r\nalthough it may do so slowly, and after two or three months it is\r\nperfected, fertilized, and a second conception occurs within the uterus.\r\nIf each embryo observe a regular period of growth and each be born at\r\nmaturity, there must be an interval of two or three months between their\r\nbirths. But it is far more common for the parturition of the first,\r\ndisplaying signs of full maturity, to coincide with the birth of a\r\nsecond which is immature and which cannot sustain respiratory life. The\r\nbirth of the latter is brought about prematurely, by the action of the\r\nuterus in expelling the matured child.\r\n\r\n\r\nUTERINE PREGNANCY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are many who manifest a laudable desire to understand the\r\nphysiology of conception, the changes which take place, and the order of\r\ntheir natural occurrence. When impregnation takes place at the ovaries\r\nor within the Fallopian tubes, there is exuded upon the inner surface of\r\nthe womb a peculiar nutritious substance. It flows out of the minute\r\nporous openings surrounding the termination of the Fallopian tube within\r\nthe uterine cavity, and, thus, is in readiness to receive the germ, and\r\nretain it there until it becomes attached. Undoubtedly, the germ imbibes\r\nmaterials from this matter for its nurture and growth. This membranous\r\nsubstance is termed the _decidua_, and disappears after conception is\r\ninsured. Two membranes form around the embryo; the inner one is called\r\nthe _amnion_, the outer one the _chorion_. Both serve for the protection\r\nof the embryo, and the inner one contains the _liquor amnii,_ in which\r\nit floats during intra-uterine life. Immediately after conception, the\r\nsmall glands in the neck of the uterus usually throw out a sticky\r\nsecretion, filling the canal, or uniting its sides, so that nothing can\r\nenter or leave the uterine cavity.\r\n\r\nThe fertilized ovum rapidly develops. After its conception it imbibes\r\nnourishment, and there is a disposition in fluids to pass into it,\r\nthrough its delicately-organized membranes. If this process is not\r\ninvoluntary, it is, at all events, at the convenience and use of the\r\ndeveloping germ. After three months the embryo is termed the _foetus_.\r\nIts fluids are then so much more highly organized, that some of them are\r\ntinged with sanguine hues, and thenceforward acquire the characteristics\r\nof red blood. Out of red blood, blood-vessels are formed, and from the\r\nincipient development of the heart follow faint lines of arteries, and\r\nthe engineers of nutrition survey a circulatory system, perfecting the\r\nvascular connections by supplementing the arteries with a complete\r\nnet-work of veins and capillaries.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PLACENTA OR AFTERBIRTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhenever conception occurs, a soft, spongy substance is formed between\r\nthe uterus and the growing ovum, called the _placenta_. It is composed\r\nof membrane, cellular tissue, blood-vessels, and connecting filaments.\r\nThe principal use of this organ seems to be to decarbonate the blood of\r\nthe foetus, and to supply it with oxygen. It performs the same function\r\nfor the foetus that the lungs do for the organism after birth. It allows\r\nthe blood of the foetus to come into very close contact with that of the\r\nmother, from which it receives a supply of oxygen, and to which it gives\r\nup carbonic acid. This interchange of gases takes place in the placenta,\r\nor between it and the uterus, through the intervening membranes. This\r\ndecarbonating function requires the agency of the maternal lungs, for\r\nthe purpose of oxygenating the mother's blood.\r\n\r\nThe placenta is attached to the uterus by simple adhesion. True, in some\r\ninstances, morbid adhesion takes place, or a growing together in\r\nconsequence of inflammation, but the natural junction is one merely of\r\ncontact, the membranes of the placenta spreading out upon the cavity of\r\nthe uterus, so that, finally, the former may be entirely removed without\r\na particle of disturbance or injury to the latter. Formerly, it was\r\nsupposed that the placental vessels penetrated into the substance of the\r\nuterus. We know now there is no such continuation of the vessels of the\r\none into the other. The decarbonation of the blood requires the\r\nplacental and uterine membranes to be in contact with each other.\r\n\r\nIf the union were vascular, the mother's blood would circulate in the\r\nfoetal body, and the impulses of the maternal heart might prove too\r\nstrong for the delicate organism of the embryo. Besides, the separation\r\nof the placenta from the uterus might prove fatal to both parent and\r\noffspring. The placenta is only a temporary organ, and when its\r\nfunctions are no longer required, it is easily and safely removed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UMBILICAL CORD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foetal blood is transmitted to and fro between the body of the child\r\nand the placenta, by a cord which contains two arteries and one vein.\r\nThis is called the _umbilical cord_, because it enters the body at the\r\nmiddle of the abdominal region, or _umbilicus_. It is composed, also, of\r\nits own proper membranous sheath, or skin, and cellular tissues, besides\r\nthe blood-vessels. Two months after pregnancy, this cord can be seen,\r\nwhen it commences to grow rapidly.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUICKENING.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot until the mother feels motion is she said to be quick with child.\r\nThat is, the child must be old and strong enough to communicate a\r\nphysical impulse, which the mother can distinctly perceive, before it is\r\nregarded as having received life. This is a fallacy, for the germ has to\r\nbe endowed with life before organization can begin. The act of\r\nimpregnation communicates the vital principle, and from that moment it\r\nstarts upon its career of development. A long period elapses after this\r\noccurs before it can make the mother feel its motions. Before\r\nquickening, the attempt to destroy the foetus is not considered so grave\r\na crime by our laws, but after this quickening takes place, it is deemed\r\na felony.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RIGHT TO TERMINATE PREGNANCY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe expediency and the moral right to prematurely terminate pregnancy\r\nmust be admitted when weighty and sufficient reasons for it exist. Such\r\na course should never be undertaken, however, without the advice and\r\napproval of the family physician, and, whenever it is possible, the\r\ncounsel of another medical practitioner should be obtained. There may be\r\nso great a malformation of the pelvic bones as to preclude delivery at\r\nfull term, or, as in some instances, the pregnant condition may endanger\r\nthe life of the mother, because she is not able to retain nourishment\r\nupon the stomach. In such cases only, is interference warranted, and\r\neven then the advice of some well-informed physician should be first\r\nobtained, to make sure that the life of the mother is endangered before\r\nso extreme a measure is resorted to.\r\n\r\nThose who are qualified for maternal duties should not undertake to\r\ndefeat the intentions of nature, simply because they love ease and\r\ndislike responsibility. Such persons may be considered genteel ladies,\r\nbut, practically, they are indifferent to the claims of society and\r\nposterity. How such selfishness contrasts with the glorious, heroic,\r\nSpartan spirit of the young woman who consulted us in reference to the\r\nacceptance of a tempting offer of marriage! She was below medium size\r\nand delicately organized. She hesitated in her answer, because she was\r\nuncertain as to her duty to herself, and to her proposed husband, and on\r\naccount of the prospective contingencies of matrimony. After she was\r\ntold that it was doubtful whether she could discharge the obligations of\r\nmaternity with safety to herself, and yet that she might prove to her\r\nintended husband a true and valuable wife, she quickly answered, her\r\nblack eyes radiant with the high purpose of her soul: \"If I assent to\r\nthis offer, I shall accept the condition and its consequences also, even\r\nif pregnancy be my lot and I know it will cost me my life!\" She acceded\r\nto the proposal, and years found them one in happiness; then a daughter\r\nwas born, but the bearing and nursing were too much for her delicate\r\nconstitution, and she continued to sink until she found rest in the\r\ngrave. Of all her beautiful and noble sayings, none reflect more moral\r\ngrandeur of spirit than the one in which she expressed her purpose to\r\nprove true to posterity.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SIGNS OF PREGNANCY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe symptoms which indicate pregnancy are cessation of the menses,\r\nenlargement of the mammæ, nausea, especially in the morning, distention\r\nof the abdomen, and movement of the foetus. A married woman has reason\r\nto suspect that she may have conceived, when, at the proper time, she\r\nfails to menstruate, especially when she knows that she is liable to\r\nbecome pregnant. A second menstrual failure strengthens this suspicion,\r\nalthough there are many other causes which might prevent the appearance\r\nof the menses, such as disease of the uterus, general debility, or\r\ntaking cold, and all of these should be taken into account. In the\r\nabsence of all apparent influences calculated to obstruct the menses,\r\nthe presumption ordinarily is that pregnancy is the cause of their\r\nnon-appearance. The evidence is still more conclusive when the mammæ and\r\nabdomen enlarge after experiencing morning sickness. Notwithstanding all\r\nthese symptoms, the audible sound of the heart, or the movements of the\r\nfoetus, are the only _infallible_ signs of a pregnant condition.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DURATION OF PREGNANCY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ordinary duration of pregnancy is about forty weeks, or 280 days. It\r\nis difficult to foretell exactly when a pregnancy will be completed, for\r\nit cannot be known precisely when it began. Some gestations are more\r\nprotracted than others, but the average duration is the time we have\r\ngiven. A very reasonable way to compute the term, is to reckon three\r\nmonths back from the day when the menses ceased and then add five days\r\nto that time, which will be the date of the expected time of\r\nconfinement. It is customary, also, for women to count from the middle\r\nof the month after the last appearance of the menses, and then allow ten\r\n_lunar_ months for the term. This computation generally proves correct,\r\nexcept in those instances in which conception takes place immediately\r\nbefore the fast appearance of the catamenia. A few women can forecast\r\nthe time of labor from the occurrence of quickening, by allowing\r\neighteen weeks for the time which has elapsed since conception, and\r\ntwenty-two more for the time yet to elapse before the confinement. With\r\nthose in whom quickening occurs regularly in a certain week of\r\npregnancy, this calculation may prove nearly correct.\r\n\r\nThe English law fixes no precise limit for the legitimacy of the child.\r\nIn France a child is regarded as lawfully begotten if born within three\r\nhundred days after the death or departure of the husband. There are a\r\nsufficient number of cases on record to show that gestation may be\r\nprolonged two, and even three, weeks beyond the ordinary, or average\r\nterm. The variation of time may be thus accounted for: after\r\ninsemination, a considerable interval elapses before fecundation takes\r\nplace, and the passage of the fertilized germ from the ovary to the\r\nuterus is also liable to be retarded. There are many circumstances and\r\nconditions which might serve to diminish its ordinary rate of progress,\r\nand postpone the date of conception. This would materially lengthen the\r\n_apparent_ time of gestation.\r\n\r\nIt is likewise difficult to determine the shortest period at which\r\ngestation may terminate, and the child be able to survive. A child may\r\nbe born and continue to live for some months, after twenty-four or\r\ntwenty-five weeks of gestation; it was so decided, at least, in an\r\necclesiastical trial.\r\n\r\nWe have not the space to describe minutely, or at length, the formation\r\nand growth of the foetal structures, and trace them separately from\r\ntheir origin to their completion at the birth of the child. The student\r\nof medicine must gain information by consulting large works and\r\nexhaustive treatises on this interesting subject.\r\n\r\nWhat trifling contingencies defeat vitality! Conception may be prevented\r\nby acrid secretions, the result of disease of the reproductive organs.\r\nLeucorrheal matter may destroy the vitalizing power of the sperm-cells.\r\nThere are many ways, even after impregnation, of compromising the\r\nexistence of the frail embryo. Accidents, injuries, falls, blows, acute\r\ndiseases, insufficient nutrition and development, in fact, a great\r\nvariety of occurrences may destroy the life of the embryo, or foetus.\r\nAfter birth, numerous diseases menace the child. By what constant care\r\nmust it ever be surrounded, and how often is it snatched from the very\r\njaws of death!\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is man but simply a germ, evolving higher powers, and\r\ndestined for a purer and nobler existence! His latent life secretly\r\nemerges from mysterious obscurity, is incarnated, and borne upon the\r\nflowing stream of time to a spiritual destination--to realms of\r\nimmortality! As he nears those ever-blooming shores, the eye of faith,\r\nilluminated by the inspired word, dimly discerns the perennial glories.\r\nQuickened by Faith, Hope, and Love, his spirit is transplanted into the\r\ngarden of paradise, the Eden of happiness, redeemed, perfected, and made\r\nglorious in the divine image of Him who hath said, \"I am the Way, the\r\n_Truth_, and the LIFE.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\nHYGIENE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nHYGIENE DEFINED.--PURE AIR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe object of hygiene is the _preservation of health_. Hitherto, we have\r\nconsidered, at some length, the science of functions, or _Physiology_,\r\nand now, under the head of _Hygiene_, we will give an outline of the\r\nmeans of maintaining the functional integrity of the system. It is\r\ndifficult to avoid including under this head Preventive Medicine, the\r\nspecial province of which is to abate, remove, or destroy the many\r\ncauses of disease.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks bestowed divine honors upon Aesculapius, because he remedied\r\nthe evils of mankind and healed the sick. The word hygiene is derived\r\nfrom Hygeia, the name of the Greek goddess of health. As male and female\r\nare made one in wedlock, so Medicine and Hygiene, restoration and\r\npreservation, are inseparably united.\r\n\r\nHygiene inculcates sanitary discipline, medicine, remedial discipline;\r\nhygiene prescribes healthful agencies, medical theory and practice,\r\nmedicinal agencies; hygiene ministers with salubrious and salutary\r\nagents, medicine assuages with rectifying properties and qualities;\r\nhygiene upholds and sustains, medical practice corrects and heals; the\r\none is preservative and conservative, the other curative and\r\nrestorative. These discriminations are as radical as health and\r\nsickness, as distinct as physiology and pathology, and to confound them\r\nis as unnatural as to look for the beauties of health in the chamber of\r\nsickness.\r\n\r\nThe true physician brings to his aid Physiology, Hygiene, and Medicine,\r\nand combines the science of the former with the art of the latter, that\r\nrestoration may be made permanent, and the health preserved by the aid\r\nof hygiene. But when any one makes Hygiene exclusively the physician, or\r\ndeals wholly in hygienic regulations with little respect for physiology,\r\nor lavishly advertises with hygienic prefixes, we may at once consider\r\nit a display, not of genuine scientific knowledge, but only of the\r\nignorance of a quack. Some of the modern twaddle about health is a\r\nconglomeration of the poorest kind of trash, expressing and inculcating\r\nmore errors and whims than it does common sense. Many persons dilate\r\nupon these subjects with amazing flippancy, their mission seeming to be\r\nto traduce the profession rather than to act as help-mates and\r\nassistants. We do not believe that there is any real argument going on\r\nbetween the educated members of the medical profession but rather that\r\nthe senseless clamor we occasionally hear comes only from the stampede\r\nof some routed, demoralized company of quacks.\r\n\r\nIn the following pages we shall introduce to the reader's attention\r\nseveral important hygienic subjects, although there are many more that\r\nought to receive special notice. Such as we do mention, demand universal\r\nattention, because a disregard of the conditions which we shall\r\nenumerate, is fraught with great danger. Our lives are lengthened or\r\nshortened by the observance or neglect of the rules of common sense, and\r\nthese do not require any great personal sacrifice, or the practice of\r\nabsurd precautions.\r\n\r\n\r\nPURE AIR FOR RESPIRATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrdinary atmospheric air contains nearly 2,100 parts of oxygen and 7,900\r\nof nitrogen, and about three parts of carbonic acid, in 10,000 parts;\r\nexpired air contains about 470 parts of carbonic acid, and only between\r\n1500 and 1600 parts of oxygen, while the quantity of nitrogen undergoes\r\nlittle or no alteration. Thus air which has been breathed has lost about\r\nfive per cent. of oxygen and has gained nearly five per cent. of\r\ncarbonic acid. In addition the expired air contains a greater or less\r\nquantity of highly decomposable animal matter, and, however dry the\r\natmospheric air may be, the expired air is always saturated with watery\r\nvapor, and, no matter what the temperature of the external air may be,\r\nthat of the exhaled air is always nearly as warm as the blood. An adult\r\nman on a average breathes about sixteen times in a minute and at every\r\ninspiration takes in about thirty cubic inches of air, and at every\r\nexpiration exhales about the same amount. Hence, it follows that about\r\n16-2/3 cubic feet of air are passed through the lungs of an adult man\r\nevery hour, and deprived of oxygen and charged with carbonic acid to the\r\namount of nearly five per cent. The more nearly the composition of the\r\nexternal air approaches that of the expired air, the slower will be the\r\ndiffusion of carbonic acid outwards and of oxygen inwards, and the more\r\ncharged with carbonic acid and deficient in oxygen will the blood in the\r\nlungs become. Asphyxia takes place whenever the proportion of carbonic\r\nacid in the external air reaches ten per cent., providing the oxygen is\r\ndiminished in like proportion, and it does not matter whether this\r\ncondition of the external air is produced by shutting out fresh air from\r\na room or by increasing the number of persons who are consuming the same\r\nair; or by permitting the air to be deprived of oxygen by combustion by\r\na fire. A deficiency of oxygen and an accumulation of carbonic acid in\r\nthe atmosphere, produce injurious effects, however, long before the\r\nasphyxiating point is attained. Headache, drowsiness, and uneasiness\r\noccur when less than one per cent. of the oxygen of the atmosphere is\r\nreplaced by other matters, and the constant breathing of such an\r\natmosphere lowers vitality and predisposes to disease.\r\n\r\nTherefore, every human being should be supplied, by proper ventilation,\r\nwith a sufficient supply of fresh air. Every adult individual ought to\r\nhave at least 800 cubic feet of air-space to himself, and this space\r\nought to communicate freely with the external atmosphere by means of\r\ndirect or indirect channels. Hence, a sleeping-room for one adult person\r\nshould not be less than nine by ten feet in breadth and length and nine\r\nfeet in height. What occurred in the Black Hole at Calcutta is an\r\nexcellent illustration of the effect of vitiated air. One hundred and\r\nforty-six Englishmen were confined in a room eighteen feet square, with\r\ntwo small windows on one side to admit air. Ten hours after their\r\nimprisonment, only twenty-three were alive.\r\n\r\nVENTILATION OF SCHOOL ROOMS. The depression and faintness from which\r\nmany students suffer, after being confined in a poorly ventilated school\r\nroom, is clearly traceable to vitiated air, while the evil is often\r\nascribed to excessive mental exertion. The effect of ventilation upon\r\nthe health of students is a subject of universal interest to parents and\r\neducators, and at present is receiving the marked attention of school\r\nauthorities. Dr. F. Windsor, of Winchester, Mass., made a few pertinent\r\nremarks upon this subject in the annual report of the State Board of\r\nHealth, of Massachusetts, 1874. One of the institutions, which was\r\nspoken of in the report of 1873, as a _model_, in the warming and\r\nventilation of which much care had been bestowed, was visited in\r\nDecember, 1873. He reports as follows: \"I visited several of the rooms,\r\nand found the air in all, offensive to the smell, the odor being such as\r\none would imagine old boots, dirty clothes, and perspiration would make\r\nif boiled down together;\" again, in the new _model_ school-house the hot\r\nair enters at two registers in the floor on one side, and makes (or is\r\nsupposed to make) its exit by a ventilator at the floor, on the other\r\nside of the room.\" The master said \"_the air was supposed to have some\r\ndegree of intelligence, and to know that the ventilator was its proper\r\nexit_.\" Thorough ventilation has been neglected by many school officials\r\non account of the increased expense it causes. In our climate, during\r\nseven months at least, pure atmospheric air must be paid for. The\r\nconstruction of vertical ducts, the extra amount of fuel, and the\r\nattendant expenditures are the objections which, in the opinion of many\r\npersons, outweigh the health and happiness of the future generation. It\r\nis necessary for the proper ventilation of our school rooms that an\r\nadequate supply of fresh air should be admitted, which should be warmed\r\nbefore being admitted to the room, and which should be discharged as\r\ncontaminated, after its expiration. The proper ventilation of the school\r\nroom consists in the warming and introduction of fresh air from without,\r\nand the discharge of the expired and unwholesome air from within. This\r\nmay be accomplished by means of doors, windows, chimneys, and finally by\r\nventilators placed, one near the level of the floor, and the other near\r\nthe ceiling of the room. The ventilators ought to be arranged on the\r\nopposite sides of the room, in order to insure a current, and an\r\nabundant supply of air. When trustees and patrons realize that pure air\r\nis absolutely essential to health, and that their children are being\r\nslowly poisoned by the foul air of school rooms, then they will\r\nconstruct our halls of learning with a due regard for the laws of\r\nhygiene, and students will not droop under their tasks on account of the\r\nabsence of Nature's most bountiful gift, _pure air_.\r\n\r\nVENTILATION OF FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS. This is a subject which demands\r\nthe immediate attention of manufacturers and employers. The odors of\r\noil, coal gas, and animal products, render the air foul and stagnant,\r\nand often give rise to violent diseases among the operatives. From two\r\nto four hundred persons are often confined in workshops six hundred feet\r\nlong, with no means of ventilation except windows _on one side only_.\r\nThe air is breathed and re-breathed, until the operatives complain of\r\nlanguor and headache, which they attribute to overwork. The _real_ cause\r\nof the headache is the inhalation of foul air at every expansion of the\r\nlungs. If the proprietors would provide efficient means for ventilating\r\ntheir workshops, the cost of construction would be repaid with compound\r\ninterest, in the better health of their operatives and the consequent\r\nincrease of labor. Our manufacturers must learn and practice the great\r\nprinciple of political economy, namely, that the interests of the\r\nlaborer and employer are mutual.\r\n\r\nVENTILATION OF OUR DWELLINGS. Not less important is the ventilation of\r\nour dwellings; each apartment should be provided with some channel for\r\nthe escape of the noxious vapors constantly accumulating. Most of the\r\ntenements occupied by the poor of our cities are literally dens of\r\npoison. Their children inhale disease with their earliest breath. What\r\nwonder that our streets are filled with squalid, wan-visaged children!\r\nCharity, indeed, visits these miserable homes, bringing garments and\r\nfood to their half-famished inmates; but she has been slow to learn that\r\nfresh air is just as essential to life as food or clothing. Care should\r\nbe taken by the public authorities of every city, that its tenement\r\nhouses do not degenerate into foul hovels, like those of the poor\r\nEnglish laborer, so graphically portrayed by Dickens. But ill-ventilated\r\nrooms are not found exclusively in the abodes of the poor. True, in the\r\nhomes of luxury, the effect of vitiated air is modified by food, etc.\r\nMen of wealth give far more attention to the architecture and adornment\r\nof their houses, to costly decorations and expensive furniture, than to\r\nproper ventilation. Farmers, too, are careless in the construction of\r\ntheir cottages. Their dwellings are often built, for convenience, in too\r\nclose proximity to the barn. Because they do not construct a suitable\r\nsewer or drain, the filth and refuse food is thrown out of the back\r\ndoor, where it accumulates and undergoes putrefaction; the vitiated air\r\npenetrates the interior of the house, and, there being no means of\r\nventilation, it remains to be breathed by the occupants. The result is,\r\nthat for the sake of saving a few dollars, which ought to be expended in\r\nthe construction of necessary flues and sewers, the farmer often sees\r\nthe child he prizes far more than his broad acres gradually decline, or\r\nsuddenly fall a victim to fevers or malignant disease. Parents, make\r\nyour homes healthy, let in the pure, fresh air and bright sunlight, so\r\nthat your conscience may never upbraid you with being neglectful of the\r\nhealth and lives of your little ones.\r\n\r\n\r\nSITE FOR HOMES.\r\n\r\n\r\nMALARIA. When about to construct our residences, besides securing proper\r\nventilation and adequate drainage, we ought to select the location for a\r\nhome on dry soil. Low levels, damp surroundings, and marshy localities\r\nnot only breed malaria and fevers, but are a prolific cause of colds,\r\ncoughs, and consumption. Care should be taken not to locate a dwelling\r\nwhere the natural currents of air, or high winds, will be likely to\r\nbring the poison of decayed vegetable matter from low lands. Certain\r\nbrooks, boggy land, ponds, foggy localities, too much shade, all these\r\nare favorable to the development of disease. Then the walls of a\r\nbuilding should be so constructed as to admit air between the exterior\r\nand interior surfaces, otherwise the interior of the house will be damp\r\nand unwholesome. In the dead of winter in northern latitudes the house\r\nought to be kept slightly tempered with warmth, both night and day, a\r\ncondition very favorable to the introduction and change of atmospheric\r\ncurrents. The invigorating tendencies of a dry, pure atmosphere are\r\nremarkably beneficial, while air charged with moisture and decay is\r\nexceedingly baneful, introducing diseases under various forms.\r\n\r\nNeither should the dwelling be shaded by dense foliage. The dampness of\r\nthe leaves tends to attract malaria. Trees growing a little distance\r\nfrom the house, however, obstruct the transmission of unhealthy vapors\r\narising beyond them. Malaria generally lurks near the surface of the\r\nearth, and seems to be more abundant in the night time. Persons sleeping\r\nin the upper story of a house may escape its morbid influence, while\r\nthose occupying apartments on the lower floor, become affected.\r\n\r\n\r\nDAMP CELLARS.\r\n\r\n\r\nDamp cellars, under residences, are a fruitful cause of disease. Dr.\r\nSanford B. Hunt, in an article in the _Newark Daily Advertiser_,\r\nspeaking of the recent epidemic of diphtheria in New York City, says:\r\n\r\n\"Pestilences that come bodily, like cholera, are faced and beaten by\r\nsanitary measures. Those which come more subtly need for their defeat\r\nonly a higher detective ability and a closer study of causes, many of\r\nwhich are known, but hidden under the cellars of our houses, and which\r\nat last are only preventable by public authority and at public expense\r\nin letting out the imprisoned dampness which saturates the earth on\r\nwhich our dwellings are built. Where wood rots, men decay. This is\r\nclearly shown in the sanitary map printed in the _Times_. In the great\r\ndistrict surrounding Central Park, and which participates in its\r\ndrainage system, there are no cases. On the whole line of Fifth Avenue\r\nthere are none. The exempt districts are clearly defined by the\r\ncharacter of the soil, drainage, and sewerage, and by the topography,\r\nwhich either has natural or artificial drainage, but most of which is so\r\ndry that only surface-water and house-filth--which does not exist in\r\nthose palaces--can affect the health of the residents. But in the\r\ntenement houses and on the made lands where running streams have been\r\nfilled in and natural springs choked up by earth fillings, diphtheria\r\nfinds a nidus in which to develop itself. The sanitary map coincides\r\nprecisely with the topographic map made by Gen. Viele. Where he locates\r\nburied springs and water-courses, there we find the plague spots of\r\ndiphtheria and in the same places, on previous maps prepared by the\r\nBoard of Health, we find other low types and stealthy diseases, such as\r\ntyphoid and irruptive fevers, and there we shall find them again when\r\nthe summer and autumnal pestilences have yielded place to those which\r\nbelong to the indoor poisoned air in the winter. The experience of other\r\ncities, notably London and Dublin, once plague spots and now as healthy\r\nas any spot on earth, proves that most of the causations of disease are\r\nwithin the control of the competent sanitary engineer, even in\r\nlocalities crowded beyond American knowledge, and houses built upon soil\r\nsaturated for centuries with the offal of successive and uncleanly\r\ngenerations. Wet earth, kept wet by the boiling up of imprisoned\r\nsprings, is a focus of disease. Dry earth is one of the most perfect\r\ndeodorizers, the best of oxydizers and absorbents, destroying the germs\r\nof disease with wonderful certainty. On those two facts rests the theory\r\nof public hygiene.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDUST AND DISEASE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe air we breathe is heavily loaded with minute particles of floating\r\ndust, their presence being revealed only by intense local illumination.\r\nProfessor Tyndall says: \"solar light, in passing through a dark room,\r\nreveals its track by illuminating the dust floating in the air. 'The\r\nsun,' says Daniel Culverwell, 'discovers atoms, though they be invisible\r\nby candle-light, and makes them dance naked in his beams.'\"\r\n\r\nAfter giving the details and results of a series of experiments in which\r\nhe attempted to extract the dust from the air of the Royal Institute by\r\npassing it through a tube containing fragments of glass wetted with\r\nconcentrated sulphuric acid, and thence through a second tube containing\r\nfragments of marble wetted with a strong solution of caustic potash,\r\nwhich experiments were attended with perfect failure, the Professor\r\ncontinues, \"I tried to intercept this floating matter in various ways;\r\nand on the day just mentioned, prior to sending the air through the\r\ndrying apparatus, I carefully permitted it to pass over the tip of a\r\nspirit-lamp flame. The floating matter no longer appeared, having been\r\nburnt up by the flame. It was, therefore, of _organic origin_. I was by\r\nno means prepared for this result; for I had thought that the dust of\r\nour air was, in great part, inorganic and non-combustile.\" In a foot\r\nnote he says, \"according to an analysis kindly furnished me by Dr.\r\nPercy, the dust collected _from the walls_ of the British Museum\r\ncontains fully fifty per cent of inorganic matter. I have every\r\nconfidence in the results of this distinguished chemist; they show that\r\nthe _floating_ dust of our rooms is, as it were, winnowed from the\r\nheavier matter.\" Again he says: \"the air of our London rooms is loaded\r\nwith this organic dust, nor is the country air free from its presence.\r\nHowever ordinary daylight may permit it to disguise itself, a\r\nsufficiently powerful beam causes dust suspended in air to appear almost\r\nas a semi-solid. Nobody could, in the first instance, without\r\nrepugnance, place the mouth at the illuminated focus of the electric\r\nbeam and inhale the thickly-massed dust revealed there. Nor is the\r\nrepugnance abolished by the reflection that, although we do not see the\r\nfloating particles, we are taking them into our lungs every hour and\r\nminute of our lives.\" \"The notion was expressed by Kircher and favored\r\nby Linnaeus, that epidemic diseases are due to germs which float in the\r\natmosphere, enter the body, and produce disturbance by the development\r\nwithin the body of parasitic life. While it was struggling against great\r\nodds, this theory found an expounder and a defender in the President of\r\nthis institution. At a time when most of his medical brethren considered\r\nit a wild dream, Sir Henry Holland contended that some form of the\r\ngerm-theory was probably true.\" Professor Tyndall proposes means by the\r\napplication of which air loaded with noxious particles may be freed from\r\nthem before entering the air passages. The following embodies his\r\nsuggestions on this point:\r\n\r\n\r\nCOTTON-WOOL RESPIRATOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I now empty my lungs as perfectly as possible, and placing a handful of\r\ncotton-wool against my mouth and nostrils, inhale through it. There is\r\nno difficulty in thus filling the lungs with air. On expiring this air\r\nthrough a glass tube, its freedom from floating matter is at once\r\nmanifest. From the very beginning of the act of expiration the beam is\r\npierced by a black aperture. The first puff from the lungs abolishes the\r\nilluminated dust, and puts a patch of darkness in its place; and the\r\ndarkness continues throughout the entire course of the expiration. When\r\nthe tube is placed below the beam and moved to and fro, the same\r\nsmoke-like appearance as that obtained with a flame is observed. _In\r\nshort, the cotton-wool, when used in sufficient quantity, and with due\r\ncare, completely intercepts the floating matter on its way to the\r\nlungs_.\r\n\r\nThe application of these experiments is obvious. If a physician wishes\r\nto hold back from the lungs of his patient, or from his own, the germs\r\nor virus by which contagious disease is propagated, he will employ a\r\ncotton-wool respirator. If perfectly filtered, attendants may breathe\r\nthe air unharmed. In all probability the protection of the lungs and\r\nmouth will be the protection of the entire system. For it is exceedingly\r\nprobable that the germs which lodge in the air-passages, or find their\r\nway with the saliva into the stomach with its absorbent system, are\r\nthose which sow in the body epidemic disease. If this be so, then\r\ndisease can be warded off by carefully prepared filters of cotton-wool.\r\nI should be most willing to test their efficacy in my own person. But\r\napart from all doubtful applications, it is perfectly certain that\r\nvarious noxious trades in England may be rendered harmless by the use of\r\nsuch filters. I have had conclusive evidence of this from people engaged\r\nin such trades. A form of respirator devised by Mr. Garrick, a hotel\r\nproprietor in Glasgow, in which inhalation and exhalation occur through\r\ntwo different valves, the one permitting the air to enter through the\r\ncotton-wool, and the other permitting the exit of the air direct into\r\nthe atmosphere, is well adapted for this purpose. But other forms might\r\nreadily be devised.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLIGHT AND HEALTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur dwellings ought freely to admit the sunlight. Diseases which have\r\nbaffled the skill of physicians have been known to yield when the\r\npatients were removed from dark rooms to light and cheerful apartments.\r\nLavoisier placed light, as an agent of health, even before pure air.\r\nPlants which grow in the shade are slender and weak, and children\r\nbrought up in dark rooms are pale, sallow, and rickety. It is a bad\r\npractice to avoid the sunlight through fear of spoiling the complexion,\r\nsince the sun's rays are necessary to give to it the delicate tints of\r\nbeauty and health. Air is necessary for the first inspiration and the\r\nlast expiration of our lives, but the purity and healthfulness of the\r\natmosphere depend upon the warming rays of the sun, while our bodies\r\nrequire light in order that their functions may be properly performed.\r\nWe know that without solar light, there can be no proper vegetable\r\ngrowth, and it is equally necessary for the beauty and perfection of\r\nanimal development. Our dwellings should therefore be well lighted and\r\nmade as bright and cheerful as possible. Women who curtain the windows,\r\nsoften the light, and tint the room with some mellow shade, may do so in\r\norder to hide their own faulty complexions. The skin of persons confined\r\nin dungeons or in deep mines becomes pale or sickly yellow, the blood\r\ngrows watery, the skin blotches, and dropsy often intervenes. On the\r\nother hand, invalids carried out from darkened chambers into the bright\r\nsunlight are stimulated, the skin browns, nutrition becomes more active,\r\nthe blood improves, and they become convalescent. Light is especially\r\nnecessary for the healthy growth of children. There is nothing more\r\nbeautiful and exhilarating than the glorious sunlight. Let its luminous,\r\nwarming, and physiological forces come freely into our dwellings, enter\r\ninto the chemistry of life, animate the spirits, and pervade our homes\r\nand our hearts with its joy-inspiring and health-imparting influences.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nFOOD. BEVERAGES. ALCOHOLIC LIQUORS. CLOTHING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe human body is continually undergoing changes, which commence with\r\nthe earliest dawn of existence and end only with death. The old and\r\nworn-out materials are constantly being removed to make room for the\r\nnew. Growth and development, as well as the elimination of worn-out and\r\nuseless matter, continually require new supplies, which are to be\r\nderived from our food. To fulfill these demands it is necessary that the\r\nnutriment should be of the proper quality, and of sufficient variety to\r\nfurnish all the constituents of the healthy body. In order that food may\r\nbe of utility, like other building materials, it must undergo\r\npreparation; the crude substance must be worked up into proper condition\r\nand shape for use, in other words, it must be _digested_. But this does\r\nnot end the process of supply, each different substance must be taken by\r\nthe different bands of workmen, after due preparation in the workshop,\r\nto its appropriate locality in the structure, and there fitted into its\r\nproper place; this is _assimilation_. In reality it becomes a portion of\r\nthe body, and is advantageous in maintaining the symmetry and usefulness\r\nof the part to which it is assigned; this constitutes the ultimate\r\nobject of food, _nutrition_.\r\n\r\nEATING is the process of receiving the food into the mouth, _i.e.,\r\nprehension; mastication and insalivation_--minutely dividing and mixing\r\nit with the saliva; _deglutition_--conveying it to the stomach. Plenty\r\nof time should be taken at meals to thoroughly masticate the food and\r\nmix it with the saliva, which, being one of the natural solvents, favors\r\nits farther solution by the juices of the stomach; the healthy action of\r\nthe digestive powers is favored by tranquility of mind, agreeable\r\nassociations, and pleasant conversation while eating. It is proverbial\r\nof the American people that they bolt their food whole, washing it down\r\nwith various fluids, thus forcing the stomach to perform not only its\r\nown duties, but also those of the teeth and salivary glands. This manner\r\nof dispatching food, which should go through the natural process above\r\ndescribed, is not without its baleful consequences, for the Americans\r\nare called a nation of _dyspeptics_.\r\n\r\nEating slowly, masticating the food thoroughly, and drinking but\r\nmoderately during meals, will allow the juices of the stomach to fulfill\r\ntheir proper function, and healthy digestion and nutrition will result.\r\nIf the food is swallowed nearly whole, not only will a longer time be\r\nrequired for its solution, but frequently it will ferment and begin to\r\ndecay before nutritive transformation can be effected, even when the\r\ngastric juice is undiluted with the fluids which the hurried eater\r\nimbibes during his meal.\r\n\r\nREGULARITY OF MEALS cannot be too strongly insisted upon. The stomach,\r\nas well as other parts of the body, must have intervals of rest or its\r\nenergies are soon exhausted, its functions impaired, and _dyspepsia_ is\r\nthe result. Nothing of the character of food should ever be taken except\r\nat regular meal times. Some persons are munching cakes, apples, nuts,\r\ncandies, etc., at all hours, and then wonder why they have weak\r\nstomachs. They take their meals regularly, and neither eat rapidly nor\r\ntoo much, and yet they are troubled with indigestion. The truth is they\r\nkeep their stomachs almost constantly at work, and hence tired out,\r\nwhich is the occasion of the annoyance and distress they experience.\r\n\r\nEATING TOO MUCH. It should always be remembered that the nutrition of\r\nour bodies does not depend upon the amount eaten, but upon the amount\r\nthat is digested. Eating too much is nearly as bad as swallowing the\r\nfood whole. The stomach is unable to digest all of it, and it ferments\r\nand gives rise to unpleasant results. The unnatural distention of the\r\nstomach with food causes it to press upon the neighboring organs,\r\ninterfering with the proper performance of their functions, and, if\r\nfrequently repeated, gives rise to serious disease. People more\r\nfrequently eat too much than too little, and to omit a meal when the\r\nstomach is slightly deranged is frequently the best medicine. It is an\r\nexcellent plan to rise from the table before the desire for food is\r\nquite satisfied.\r\n\r\nLATE SUPPERS. It is generally conceded that late suppers are injurious,\r\nand should never be indulged in. Persons who dine late have little need\r\nof food after their dinner, unless they are kept up until a late hour.\r\nIn such cases a moderate meal may be allowed, but it should be eaten two\r\nor three hours before retiring. Those who dine in the middle of the day\r\nshould have supper, but sufficiently early so that a proper length of\r\ntime may elapse before going to bed, in order that active digestion may\r\nnot be required during sleep. On the other hand, it is not advisable to\r\ngo wholly without this meal, but the food eaten should be light, easily\r\ndigestible, and moderate in quantity. Persons who indulge in hearty\r\nsuppers at late hours, usually experience a poor night's rest, and wake\r\nthe next morning unrefreshed, with a headache and a deranged stomach.\r\nOccasionally more serious consequences follow; gastric disorders result,\r\napoplexy is induced; or, perhaps, the individual never wakes.\r\n\r\nFEEDING INFANTS. For at least six or seven months after birth, the most\r\nappropriate food for an infant is its mother's milk, which, when the\r\nparent is healthy, is rich in all the elements necessary for its growth\r\nand support. Next to the mother's milk, that of a healthy nurse should\r\nbe preferred; in the absence of both, milk from a cow that has recently\r\ncalved is the most natural substitute, in the proportion of one part\r\nwater to two parts milk, slightly sweetened. The milk used should be\r\nfrom but one cow. All sorts of paps, gruels, panadas, cordials,\r\nlaxatives, etc., should be strictly prohibited, for their employment as\r\nfood cannot be too severely censured. Vomiting, diarrhea, colic, green\r\nstools, griping, etc., are the inevitable results of their continued\r\nuse. The child should be fed at regular intervals, of about two hours,\r\nand be limited to a proper amount each time, which, during the first\r\nmonth, is about two ounces. From 11 P.M. to 5 A.M. the child should be\r\nnursed but once. As the child grows older the intervals should be\r\nlengthened, and the amount taken at a time gradually increased. The plan\r\nof gorging the infant's stomach with food every time it cries, cannot be\r\ntoo emphatically condemned.\r\n\r\nAfter the sixth or seventh month, in addition to milk, bits of bread may\r\nbe allowed, the quantity being slowly increased, thus permitting the\r\ndiet to change gradually from fluid to solid food, so that, when the\r\nteeth are sufficiently developed for mastication, the child has become\r\naccustomed to various kinds of nourishment. Over-feeding, and\r\ncontinually dosing the child with cordial, soothing syrups, etc., are\r\nthe most fruitful sources of infant mortality, and should receive the\r\ncondemnation of every mother in the land.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION OF FOOD. The production of pure blood requires that all the\r\nfood selected should be rich in nutritious elements, and well cooked. To\r\nannounce a standard by which all persons shall be guided in the\r\nselection and preparation of their food is impossible. Especially is\r\nthis the case in a country the inhabitants of which represent almost\r\nevery nation on the face of the globe. Travelers are aware that there is\r\nas much diversity in the articles of food and methods of cookery, among\r\nthe various nationalities, as in the erection of their dwellings, and in\r\ntheir mental characteristics. In America we have a conglomeration of all\r\nthese peoples; and for a native American to lay down rules of cookery\r\nfor his German, French, English, Welsh, and Irish neighbors, or _vice\r\nversa_, is useless, for they will seldom read them, and, therefore,\r\ncannot profit by them. There are, however, certain conditions recognized\r\nby the hygienic writers of every nation. The adequate nutrition of the\r\norganic tissues demands a plentiful supply of pure blood, or the\r\ndigestive apparatus will become impaired, the mental processes deranged,\r\nand the entire bony and muscular systems will lose their strength and\r\nelasticity, and be incapacitated for labor.\r\n\r\nDIFFERENT KINDS OF FOOD REQUIRED. The different periods and\r\ncircumstances of life require their appropriate food, and the welfare of\r\nmankind demands that it should supply both the inorganic and organic\r\nsubstances employed in the development of every tissue. The inorganic\r\nelements employed in our construction, of which _Phosphorus, Sulphur,\r\nSoda, Iron, Lime,_ and _Potash_ are the most important, are not\r\nconsidered as aliments, but are found in the organic kingdom, variously\r\narranged and combined with organic materials in sufficient quantities\r\nfor ordinary purposes. When, however, from any cause, a lack of any of\r\nthese occurs, so that their relative normal proportions are deranged,\r\nthe system suffers, and restoration to a healthy condition can only be\r\naccomplished by supplying the deficiency; this may be done by selecting\r\nthe article of food richest in the element which is wanting, or by\r\nintroducing it as a medicine. It must be remembered that those\r\nsubstances which enter into the construction of the human fabric, are\r\nnot promiscuously employed by nature, but that each and every one is\r\ndestined to fulfill a definite indication.\r\n\r\n_Lime_ enters largely into the formation of bone, either as a\r\n_phosphate_ or a _carbonate_, and is required in much greater quantities\r\nin early life, while the bone is undergoing development, than\r\nafterwards. In childhood the bones are composed largely of animal\r\nmatter, being pliable and easily moulded. For this reason the limbs of\r\nyoung children bend under the weight of their bodies, and unless care is\r\ntaken they become bow-legged and distorted. Whenever there is a\r\ncontinued deficiency of the earthy constituents, disease of the bones\r\nensues. Therefore, during childhood, and particularly during the period\r\nof dentition, or teething, the food should be nutritious and at the same\r\ntime contain a due proportion of lime, which is preferable in the form\r\nof a phosphate. When it cannot be furnished by the food, it should be\r\nsupplied artificially. Delayed, prolonged, and tedious dentition\r\ngenerally arises from a deficiency of lime.\r\n\r\nWith the advance of age it accumulates, and the bone becomes hard,\r\ninelastic, and capable of supporting heavy weights. Farther on, as in\r\nold age, the animal matter of bone becomes diminished, and lime takes\r\nits place, so that the bones become brittle and are easily broken. Lime\r\nexists largely in hard water, and to a greater or less extent in milk,\r\nand in nearly all foods except those of an acid character.\r\n\r\n_Phosphorus_ exists in various combinations in different parts of the\r\nbody, particularly in the brain and nervous system. Persons who perform\r\na large amount of mental labor require more phosphorus than those\r\nengaged in other pursuits. It exists largely in the hulls of wheat, in\r\nfish, and in eggs. It should enter to a considerable extent into the\r\ndiet of brain workers, and the bread consumed by them should be made of\r\nunbolted flour.\r\n\r\n_Sulphur, Iron, Soda_, and _Potash_ are all necessary in the various\r\ntissues of the body, and deficiency of any one of them, for any\r\nconsiderable length of time, results in disease. They are all supplied,\r\nvariously arranged and combined, in both animal and vegetable food; in\r\nsome articles they exist to a considerable extent, in others in much\r\nsmaller quantities. _Sulphur_ exists in eggs and in the flesh of\r\nanimals, and often in water. _Iron_ exists in the yolk of eggs, in\r\nflesh, and in several vegetables. _Soda_ is supplied in nearly all food,\r\nand largely in common salt, which is a composition of sodium and\r\nhydrochloric acid, the latter entering into the gastric juice. _Potash_\r\nexists, in some form or other, in sufficient quantities for health, in\r\nboth vegetable and animal food.\r\n\r\nCLASSES OF FOOD. All kinds of food substances may be divided into four\r\nclasses. _Proteids, Fats, Amyloids_, and _Minerals_. Proteids are\r\ncomposed of the four elements, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen,\r\nsometimes combined with sulphur and phosphorus. In this class are\r\nincluded the _gluten_ of flour; the _albumen_, or white of eggs; and the\r\n_serum_ of the blood; the _fibrin_ of the blood; _syntonin_, the chief\r\nconstituent of muscle and flesh, and _casein_, one of the chief\r\nconstituents of cheese, and many other similar, but less frequent\r\nsubstances.\r\n\r\nFats are composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen only, and contain more\r\nhydrogen than would be required to form water if united with the oxygen\r\nwhich they contain. All vegetable and animal oils and fatty matters are\r\nincluded in this class.\r\n\r\nAmyloids consist of substances which are also composed of carbon,\r\noxygen, and hydrogen only; but they contain just enough hydrogen to\r\nproduce water when combined with their oxygen, or two parts of hydrogen\r\nto one of oxygen. This division includes _sugar, starch, dextrine_, and\r\n_gum_. The above three classes of food-stuffs are only obtained through\r\nthe activity of living organisms, vegetable or animal, and have been,\r\ntherefore, appropriately termed by Prof. Huxley, _vital food-stuffs._\r\n\r\nThe mineral food-stuffs may, as we have seen, be procured from either\r\nthe living or the non-living world. They include water and various\r\nearthy, metallic, and alkaline salts.\r\n\r\nVARIETY OF FOOD NECESSARY. No substance can serve permanently for food\r\nexcept it contains a certain quantity of proteid matter in the shape of\r\nalbumen, fibrin, casein, etc., and, on the other hand, any substance\r\ncontaining proteid matter in a shape in which it can be readily\r\nassimilated, may serve as a permanent vital food-stuff. Every substance,\r\nwhich is to serve as a permanent food, must contain a sufficient\r\nquantity, ready-made, of this most important and complex constituent of\r\nthe body. In addition, it must also contain a sufficient quantity of the\r\nmineral ingredients which enter into the composition of the body. Its\r\npower of supporting life and maintaining the weight and composition of\r\nthe body remains unaltered, whether it contains fats or amyloids or not.\r\nThe secretion of urea, and, consequently, the loss of nitrogen, goes on\r\ncontinually, and the body, therefore, must necessarily waste unless the\r\nsupply of proteid matter is constantly renewed, since this is the only\r\nclass of foods that contains nitrogen in any considerable quantity.\r\nThere can be no absolute necessity for any other food-stuffs but those\r\ncontaining the proteid and mineral elements of the body. From what has\r\nbeen said, it will readily be seen that whether an animal be carnivorous\r\nor herbivorous, it begins to starve as soon as its vital food-stuffs\r\nconsist only of amyloids, or fats, or both. It suffers from what has\r\nbeen termed _nitrogen starvation,_ and if proteid matters are withheld\r\nentirely, it soon dies. In such a case, and still more in the case of an\r\nanimal which is entirely deprived of vital food, the organism, as long\r\nas it continues to live, feeds upon itself, the waste products\r\nnecessarily being formed at the expense of its own body.\r\n\r\nAlthough proteid matter is the essential element of food, and under\r\ncertain circumstances may be sufficient of itself to support the body,\r\nit is a very uneconomical food. The white of an egg, which may be taken\r\nas a type of the proteids, contains about fifteen per cent. of nitrogen,\r\nand fifty-three per cent. of carbon; therefore, a man feeding upon this,\r\nwould take in about three and a half times as much carbon as nitrogen.\r\nIt has been proved that a healthy, adult man, taking a fair amount of\r\nexercise and maintaining his weight and body temperature, eliminates\r\nabout thirteen times as much carbon as nitrogen. However, if he is to\r\nget his necessary quantity, about 4000 grains of carbon, out of albumen,\r\nhe must eat 7,547 grains of that substance; but this quantity of albumen\r\ncontains nearly four times as much nitrogen as he requires. In other\r\nwords, it takes about four pounds of lean meat, free from fat, to\r\nfurnish 4,000 grains of carbon, the quantity required, whereas one pound\r\nyields the requisite quantity of nitrogen. Thus a man restricted\r\nexclusively to a proteid diet, must take an enormous quantity of it.\r\nThis would involve a large amount of unnecessary physiological labor, to\r\ncomminute, dissolve, and absorb the food, and to excrete the superfluous\r\nnitrogenous matter. Unproductive labor should be avoided as much in\r\nphysiological as in political economy. The universal practice of\r\nsubsisting on a mixed diet, in which proteids are mixed with fats or\r\namyloids, is therefore justifiable.\r\n\r\nFats contain about 80 per cent. of carbon, and amyloids about 40 per\r\ncent. We have seen that there is sufficient nitrogen in a pound of meat\r\nfree from fat, to supply a healthy adult man for twenty-four hours, but\r\nthat it contains only one-fourth of the quantity of carbon required.\r\nAbout half a pound of fat, or one pound of sugar, will supply the\r\nquantity of carbon necessary. The fat, if properly subdivided, and the\r\nsugar, by reason of its solubility, pass with great ease into the\r\ncirculation, the physiological labor, consequently, being reduced to a\r\nminimum.\r\n\r\nSeveral common articles of diet contain in themselves all the necessary\r\nelements. Thus, butchers' meat ordinarily contains from 30 to 50 per\r\ncent. of fat; and bread contains the proteid, gluten, and the amyloids,\r\nstarch and sugar, together with minute quantities of fat. However, on\r\naccount of the proportion in which these proteid and other components of\r\nthe body exist in these substances, neither of them, by itself is such a\r\nphysiologically economical food, as it is when combined with the other\r\nin the proportion of three to eight, or three quarters of a pound of\r\nmeat to two pounds of bread a day.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that a variety of food is necessary for health. Animals\r\nfed exclusively upon one class, or upon a single article of diet, droop\r\nand die; and in the human family we know that the constant use of one\r\nkind of diet causes disgust, even when not very long continued.\r\nConsequently, we infer that the welfare of man demands that his food be\r\nof sufficient variety to supply his body with all of its component\r\nparts. If this is not done the appetite is deranged, and often craves\r\nthe very article which is necessary to supply the deficiency. After the\r\ncomponent parts of the organism have assimilated the nutritious elements\r\nof particular kinds of food for a certain length of time, they lose the\r\npower of effecting the necessary changes for proper nutrition, and a\r\nsupply of other material is imperatively demanded. When the diet has\r\nbeen long restricted to proteids, consisting largely of salt meats,\r\nfresh vegetables and fruits containing the organic acids, become\r\nindispensable; otherwise, the scorbutic condition, or scurvy, is almost\r\nsure to be developed. Fresh vegetables and fruits should be eaten in\r\nconsiderable quantities at the proper seasons.\r\n\r\nVALUE OF ANIMAL FOOD. The principal animal food used in this country\r\nconsists of _Pork, Mutton, Beef_, and _Fish_. Beef and mutton are rich\r\nin muscle-producing material. Although pork is extensively produced in\r\nsome portions of this country, and enters largely into the diet of some\r\nclasses, yet its use, except in winter, is not to be encouraged. The\r\nsame amount of beef would give far greater returns in muscular power.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the meats mentioned, _Wild Game_ furnishes palatable,\r\nnutritious, and easily-digested food. _Domestic Fowls_, when young, are\r\nexcellent, and with the exception of geese and ducks, are easily\r\ndigested. _Wild Birds_ are considered much healthier food than those\r\nwhich are domesticated. All of these contain more or less of the\r\nelements which enter into the composition of the four classes of foods.\r\n\r\nVEGETABLE FOODS. _Wheat_ is rich in all the elements which compose the\r\nfour classes, and, when the flour is unbolted, it is one of the best\r\narticles for supplying all the elements.\r\n\r\n_Barley_ stands next to wheat in nourishing qualities, but is not so\r\npalatable.\r\n\r\n_Oats_ are rich in all the elements necessary for nutrition. Oatmeal is\r\na favorite article of diet among the Scotch, and, judging from their\r\nhardy constitutions, their choice is well founded. In consequence of the\r\nlarge proportion of phosphorus which they contain, they are capable of\r\nfurnishing a large amount of nourishment for the brain.\r\n\r\n_Rye_ is nutritious, but it is not so rich in tissue-forming material.\r\n\r\n_Indian Corn_ is an article well known and extensively used throughout\r\nthe United States, and is a truly valuable one, capable of being\r\nprepared in a great variety of ways for food. It contains more carbon\r\nthan wheat, and less nitrogen and phosphorus, though enough of both to\r\nbe extremely valuable.\r\n\r\n_Rice_ is rather meagre in nutriment; it contains but little phosphorous\r\nmatter, with less carbon than other cereals, and is best and most\r\ngenerally employed as a diet in tropical countries.\r\n\r\n_Beans and Peas_ are rich in nutritious matter, and furnish the manual\r\nlaborer with a cheap and wholesome diet.\r\n\r\nThe _Potato_ is the most valuable of all fresh vegetables grown in\r\ntemperate climates. Its flavor is very agreeable, and it contains very\r\nimportant nutritive and medicinal qualities, and is eaten almost daily\r\nby nearly every family in North America. Until very recently it, with\r\nthe addition of a little butter-milk or skim-milk, constituted almost\r\nthe sole diet of the Irish people. The average composition of the potato\r\nis stated by Dr. Smith to be as follows: Water 75 per cent., nitrogen\r\n2.1, starch 18.8, sugar 3.2, fat 0.2, salts 0.7. The relative values of\r\ndifferent potatoes may be ascertained very correctly by weighing them in\r\nthe hand, for the heavier the tuber the more starch it contains.\r\n\r\n_Turnip and Cabbage_ are 92.5 per cent. water, and, consequently, poor\r\nin nutrition, though they are very palatable. The solid portions of\r\ncabbage, however, are rich in albumen.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the quantity necessary to maintain the system in\r\nproper condition must be greatly modified by the habits of life, the\r\ncondition of the organism, the age, the sex, and the climate. The daily\r\nloss of substance which must be replaced by material from without, as we\r\nhave seen, is very great. In addition to the loss of carbon and\r\nnitrogen, about four and a half pounds of water are removed from the\r\nsystem in twenty-four hours, and it is necessary that about this\r\nquantity should be introduced into the system in some form or other,\r\nhowever much it may be adulterated. Professor Dalton states: \"From\r\nexperiments performed while living on an exclusive diet of bread, fresh\r\nmeat, and butter, with coffee and water for drink, we have found that\r\nthe entire quantity of food required during twenty-four hours by a man\r\nin full health and taking free exercise in the open air is as follows:\r\n\r\n    Meat,  .  .  .  .  .  .  16 oz., or 1.03 lb. avoir.\r\n    Bread, .  .  .  .  .  .  19    \"    1.19  \"    \"\r\n    Butter or fat,  .  .  .   3½   \"    0.22  \"    \"\r\n    Water, .  .  .  .  .  52 fluid oz., 3.38  \"    \"\r\n\r\nThat is to say, rather less than two and a half pounds of solid food,\r\nand rather over three pounds of liquid food.\"\r\n\r\nCLIMATE exerts an important influence on the quantity and quality of\r\nfood required by the system. In northern latitudes the inhabitants are\r\nexposed to extreme cold and require an abundant supply of food, and\r\nespecially that which contains a large amount of fat. On this account\r\nfat meat is taken in large quantities and with a relish. The quantity of\r\nfood consumed by the natives of the Arctic zone is almost incredible.\r\nThe Russian Admiral, Saritcheff, relates that one of the Esquimaux in\r\nhis presence devoured a mass of boiled rice and butter which weighed\r\ntwenty-eight pounds, at a single meal, and Dr. Hayes states that usually\r\nthe daily ration of an Esquimau is from twelve to fifteen pounds of\r\nmeat, one-third of which is fat, and on one occasion he saw a man eat\r\nten pounds of walrus flesh at a single meal. The intense cold creates a\r\nconstant craving for fatty articles of food, and some members of his own\r\nparty were in the habit of drinking the contents of the oil-kettle with\r\ngreat apparent relish.\r\n\r\nDIGESTIBILITY OF FOOD. Unless an article of diet can be digested it is\r\nof no value, no matter how rich it may be in nutriment. The quantity of\r\nfood taken, will influence to a considerable extent, the time consumed\r\nin its digestion. The stomachs of all are not alike in this respect, and\r\nthe subject of time has been a difficult one to determine. The\r\nexperiments of Dr. Beaumont with the Canadian, St. Martin, who\r\naccidentally discharged the contents of a loaded gun into his stomach,\r\ncreating an external opening through which the process of digestion\r\ncould be observed, have furnished us with the following table, which is\r\ncorrect enough to show relatively, if not absolutely, the time required\r\nfor the digestion of various articles:\r\n\r\n    ======================================================\r\n        ARTICLES OF DIET.       |  Mode of   | Hours.

It\r\nis very nutritious, and, on account of the variety of the elements which\r\nit contains, it is extremely valuable an article of diet, especially\r\nwhen the digestive powers are weakened, as in fevers, or during\r\nconvalescence from any acute disease. Eggs are also very nutritious and\r\neasily digested. Whipped eggs are digested and assimilated with great\r\nease. Fish, as a rule, are more speedily digested than is the flesh of\r\nwarm-blooded animals. Oysters, especially when taken raw, are very\r\neasily digested. We have known dyspeptics who were unable to digest any\r\nother kind of animal food, to subsist for a considerable period upon raw\r\noysters. The flesh of mammalia seems to be more easily digested than\r\nthat of birds. Beef, mutton, lamb, and venison are easily digested,\r\nwhile fat roast pork and veal are digested with difficulty. According to\r\nthe foregoing table vegetables were digested in about the same time as\r\nordinary animal food, but it should be remembered that a great part of\r\nthe digestion of these is effected in the small intestine. Soups are, as\r\na rule, very quickly digested. The time required for the digestion of\r\nbread is about the same as that required for the digestion of ordinary\r\nmeats. Boiled cabbage is one of the most difficult substances to digest.\r\n\r\nCOOKERY. \"Cookery,\" says Mrs. Owen, \"Is the art of turning every morsel\r\nto the best use; it is the exercise of skill, thought, and ingenuity to\r\nmake every particle of food yield the utmost nourishment and pleasure,\r\nof which it is capable.\" We are indebted to this practical woman for\r\nmany valuable suggestions in this art; and some of our recommendations\r\nare drawn from her experience.\r\n\r\nSOUPS. The nutritious properties, tone, and sweetness of soup depend in\r\nthe first place upon the freshness and quality of the meat; secondly on\r\nthe manner in which it is boiled. Soups should be nicely and delicately\r\nseasoned, according to the taste of the consumer, by using parsley,\r\nsage, savory, thyme, sweet marjoram, sweet basil, or any of the\r\nvegetable condiments. These may be raised in the garden, or obtained at\r\nthe drug stores, sifted and prepared for use. In extracting the juices\r\nof meats, in order that soups may be most nutritious, it is important\r\nthat the meat be put into _cold_ water, or that which is not so hot as\r\nto coagulate the albumen (which would prevent it from being extracted),\r\nand then, by slow heat and a simmering process, the most nutritious\r\nproperties will be brought out.\r\n\r\nBEEF SOUP may be made of any bone of the beef, by putting it into cold\r\nwater, adding a little salt, and skimming it well just before it boils.\r\nIf a vegetable flavor be desired, celery, carrots, onions, turnips,\r\ncabbage, or potatoes, may be added, in sufficient quantities to suit the\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\nMUTTON SOUP may be made from the fore-quarter, in the same manner as\r\ndescribed above, thickened with pearl-barley or rice, and flavored to\r\nsuit the taste.\r\n\r\nBOILED FISH. Clean the fish nicely, then sprinkle flour on a cloth and\r\nwrap it around them; salt the water, and, when it boils, put in the\r\nfish; let them boil half an hour, then carefully remove them to a\r\nplatter, adding egg sauce and parsley. To _bake fish_, prepare by\r\ncleaning, scaling, etc., and let them remain in salt water for a short\r\ntime. Make a stuffing of the crumbs of light bread, and add to it a\r\nlittle salt, pepper, butter, and sweet herbs, and stir with a spoon.\r\nThen fill the fish with the stuffing and sew it up. Put on butter, salt,\r\npepper, and flour, having enough water in the dish to keep it from\r\nburning, and baste often. A four pound fish will bake in fifty or sixty\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\nBROILED STEAK. Sirloin and porter-house steaks should be broiled\r\nquickly. Preserve them on ice for a day or two and their tenderness is\r\nmuch increased. Never broil them until the meal is ready to be served.\r\n\r\nBOILED HEAT. When meat is to be boiled for _eating,_ put it into boiling\r\nwater, by which its juices are coagulated and its richness preserved.\r\nThe slower it boils, the more tender, plump, and white it will be. Meat\r\nshould be removed as soon as done, or it will lose its flavor and become\r\nsoggy.\r\n\r\nPORK STEAKS. The best steaks are cut off the shoulder--ham steaks being\r\nrather too dry. They should be well fried, in order to destroy the\r\nlittle living parasites, called Trichinae which sometimes infest this\r\nkind of meat. They are introduced into the stomach by eating ham, pork,\r\nor sausages made from the flesh of hogs infested by them. Thorough\r\ncooking destroys them, and those who will persist in the use of swine's\r\nflesh can afford to have it \"_done brown._\"\r\n\r\nBAKED MUTTON. To bake mutton well, a person should have a brisk, sharp\r\nfire, and keep the meat well basted. It requires two hours to bake a leg\r\nof mutton, weighing eight pounds.\r\n\r\nBREAD. The health and happiness of a family depend, to a certain extent,\r\non good, well-baked bread. At all events, our enjoyment would be greater\r\nif it were only better prepared. We make the following extract from an\r\narticle printed by the State Board of Health, concerning the food of the\r\npeople of Massachusetts: \"As an example of good bread we would mention\r\nthat which is always to be had at the restaurant of Parker's Hotel, in\r\nBoston. It is not better than is found on the continent of Europe on all\r\nthe great lines of travel, and in common use by millions of people in\r\nGermany and France; but with us, it is a rare example of what bread may\r\nbe. It is made from a mixture of flour, such as is generally sold in our\r\nmarkets, water, salt, and yeast--nothing else. The yeast is made from\r\nmalt, potatoes, and hops. _The dough is kneaded from one and a half to\r\ntwo hours, and is then thoroughly baked.\"_ The truth seems to be that\r\nthe kneading, which in this country takes the housewife's time and\r\nmuscle, in Europe is done by the help of machinery. So here, in large\r\nvillages and cities, people might furnish themselves with good bread, by\r\nmeans of co-operative associations, even at a less cost than at present.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEVERAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWATER. The importance of water in the economy of nature is obvious to\r\nall. It is the most abundant substance of which we have knowledge. It\r\ncomposes four-fifths of the weight of vegetables, and three-fourths of\r\nthat of animals. It is essential to the continuance of organic life.\r\nWater is universally present in all of the tissues and fluids of the\r\nbody. It is not only abundant in the blood and secretions, but it is\r\nalso an ingredient of the solids of the body. According to the most\r\naccurate computations, water is found to constitute from two-thirds to\r\nthree-fourths of the entire weight of the human body. The following\r\ntable, compiled by Robin and Verdeil, shows the proportion of water per\r\nthousand parts in different solids and fluids:\r\n\r\n    QUANTITY OF WATER IN 1,000 PARTS.\r\n\r\n    Teeth,                100\r\n    Bones,                130\r\n    Cartilage,            550\r\n    Muscles,              750\r\n    Ligaments,            768\r\n    Brain,                789\r\n    Blood,                795\r\n    Synovial fluid,       805\r\n    Bile,                 880\r\n    Milk,                 887\r\n    Pancreatic juice,     900\r\n    Urine,                936\r\n    Lymph,                960\r\n    Gastric juice,        975\r\n    Perspiration,         986\r\n    Saliva,               995\r\n\r\nTHE NATURAL DRINK OF MAN. Water constitutes the natural drink of man. No\r\nother liquid can supply its place. Its presence, however, in the body is\r\nnot permanent. It is discharged from the body in different ways; by the\r\nurine, the feces, the breath, and the perspiration. In the first two, it\r\nis in a liquid form, in the others in a vaporous form. It is estimated\r\nthat about forty-eight per cent. is discharged in the liquid, and\r\nfifty-two per cent. in the vaporous form; but the absolute as well as\r\nthe relative amount discharged depends upon a variety of circumstances.\r\n\r\nWater is never found perfectly pure, since it holds in solution more or\r\nless of almost every substance with, which it comes in contact. Rain\r\nfalling in the country remote from habitations is the purest water that\r\nnature furnishes, for it is then only charged with the natural gases of\r\nthe atmosphere. In cities it absorbs organic and gaseous impurities, as\r\nit falls through the air, and flowing over roofs of houses carries with\r\nit soot and dust. Water from melted snow is purer than rain-water, since\r\nit descends in a solid form, and is therefore incapable of absorbing\r\ngases. Rain-water is not adapted to drinking purposes, unless well\r\nfiltered. All water, except that which has been distilled, contains air,\r\nand it is due to this fact, that aquatic animals can live in it; for\r\nexample, put a fish in distilled water and it will soon die.\r\n\r\nMINERAL IMPURITIES. Rain-water, which has filtered through the soil and\r\nstrata of the earth, dissolves the soluble materials, and carries them\r\ndown to lower levels, until they finally collect in the sea. Common\r\nwell, spring, and mineral waters contain from 5 to 60 grains to the\r\ngallon; sea-water contains 2,000 grains while in some parts of the Dead\r\nSea there are 20,000 grams to the gallon. The principal mineral\r\nimpurities of well and spring water are lime, magnesia, soda, and oxide\r\nof iron, combined with carbonic and sulphuric acids, forming carbonates,\r\nsulphates, and chloride of sodium, or common salt. The most general,\r\nhowever, are carbonate and sulphate of lime.\r\n\r\nMineral waters are usually obtained from springs which contain a\r\nconsiderable amount of saline matter. Those waters which abound in salts\r\nof iron are called _chalybeate_ or _ferruginous_. Those containing salt\r\nare termed _saline_. Those in which contain sulphur are termed\r\n_sulphurous_. Water derives the quality of hardness from the salts of\r\nlime--chiefly the sulphates--which it contains. Hard water, being an\r\nimperfect solvent, is unsuitable for washing purposes. There are two\r\nvarieties of hardness, one of which is temporary, being due to the\r\npresence of carbonic acid gas in the water which holds the salts in\r\nsolution and may be removed by merely boiling the water and thus\r\nexpelling the gas when the salts are deposited, while the other is\r\npermanent and can only be removed by the distillation of the water. It\r\nhas been ascertained that twelve pounds of the best hard soap must be\r\nadded to 10,000 gallons of water of one degree of hardness before a\r\nlather will remain and, consequently, 0.12 lb. to 100 gallons of water\r\nis a measure of one degree of hardness. Since hard water is not so\r\nuseful in cooking and other domestic purposes, as soft water, causing a\r\ngreat waste of labor and material, it is often highly desirable to\r\nsoften it, which is effected by the addition of lime in what is known as\r\n_Clark's process_. One ounce of quicklime should be added to 1000\r\ngallons of water for each degree of hardness. It should be first slacked\r\nand stirred up in a few gallons and then thoroughly mixed with the\r\nentire quantity. Then it should be allowed to remain, and will become\r\nclear in about three hours, but should not be drunk for twelve hours.\r\n\r\nThe purity of drinking water is a matter of much importance. That which\r\ncontains a minute quantity of lead will give rise to all the symptoms of\r\nlead poisoning, if the use of it be sufficiently prolonged. An account\r\nis given of the poisoning of the royal family of France, many of whom\r\nsuffered from this cause when in exile at Claremont. The amount of lead\r\nwas only one grain in the gallon. Care should therefore be taken to\r\navoid drinking the water which has been contained in leaden pipes. It\r\nshould always be allowed to run a few minutes before being used.\r\n\r\nAn excess of saline ingredients, which in small quantities are harmless,\r\nfrequently produces marked disorders of the digestive organs. A small\r\namount of putrescent matter habitually introduced into the system, as in\r\nthe use of food, is productive of the most serious results, which can be\r\ntraced to the direct action of the poison introduced. A case is recorded\r\nof a certain locality favorably situated with regard to the access of\r\npure air, where an epidemic of fever broke out much to the astonishment\r\nof the inhabitants. Upon observation it was found that the attacks of\r\nfever were limited to those families who used water from a neighboring\r\nwell. The disagreeable taste of the water which had been observed, was\r\nsubsequently traced to the bursting of a sewer, which had discharged a\r\npart of its contents into the well. When the cause was removed, there\r\nwas no recurrence of the evil effects.\r\n\r\nORGANIC IMPURITIES. \"Water is liable to organic contamination from a\r\nmultitude of causes, such as drainage from dwellings, dust, insects, the\r\ndecaying of vegetable and animal matter. These impurities may be\r\nmechanically suspended or held in solution in the water. Although\r\norganic impurities, which are mechanically suspended in water, are\r\npoisonous, yet they are generally associated with animalculea, and these\r\nfeed upon, and finally consume them. Good water never contains\r\nanimalculæ. They are never found in freshly fallen rain-water, remote\r\nfrom dwellings, but abound, to a greater or less extent in cisterns,\r\nmarshes, ponds, and rivers. These little workers serve a useful purpose\r\nsince they consume the dead organic matter from the water, and, having\r\nfulfilled their mission, sink to the bottom and die. Water which\r\ncontains organic matter is exceedingly dangerous to health, and its use\r\nshould be carefully avoided.\r\n\r\nIn low lands where the current of streams is sluggish, and shallow pools\r\nabound, the water is apt to be more or less infected with decaying\r\nvegetable substances. Many people living in such localities, and wishing\r\nto obtain water with as little trouble as possible, dig a hole in the\r\nground, a few feet in depth, and allow the stagnant surface water to\r\naccumulate. This water is used for drinking and cooking. The result is\r\nthat ague prevails in such localities.\r\n\r\nCare should be taken that wells, from which the water is used for\r\nhousehold purposes, are located at a distance from barn-yards, privies,\r\nsinks, vaults, and stagnant pools.\r\n\r\nPURIFICATION OF WATER. There are various methods of purifying water. It\r\nmay be accomplished by distillation, which is the most perfect method;\r\nby filtration through sand, crushed charcoal, and other porous\r\nsubstances, which deprives it of suspended impurities and living\r\norganisms; by boiling, which destroys the vitality of all animal and\r\nvegetable matters, drives out the gases and precipitates carbonate of\r\nlime, which composes the crust frequently seen upon the inside of\r\ntea-kettles or boilers; by the use of chemical agents, which may be\r\nemployed to destroy or precipitate the deleterious substances. Alum is\r\noften used to cleanse roily water, two or three grains in solution,\r\nbeing sufficient for a quart. It causes the impurities to settle to the\r\nbottom, so that the clear water can be poured or dipped out for use. One\r\nor two grains of the permanganate of potassium will render wholesome a\r\ngallon of water containing animal impurities.\r\n\r\nHOW TO USE WATER. Very little if any water should be taken at meal time,\r\nsince the salivary glands furnish an abundance of watery fluid to assist\r\nin mastication. When these glands are aided with water to \"wash down\"\r\nthe food, their functions become feeble and impaired. The gastric juice\r\nis diluted and digestion is weakened. Large draughts of cold water ought\r\nnever to be indulged in, since they cause derangement of the stomach.\r\nWhen the body is overheated, the use of much water is injurious. It\r\nshould only be taken in small quantities. Thirst may be partially\r\nallayed, without injury, by holding cold water in the mouth for a short\r\ntime and then spitting it out, taking care to swallow but very little.\r\nTravelers frequently experience inconvenience from change of water. If\r\nthe means are at hand, let them purify their drinking water, if not,\r\nthey should drink as little as possible. Persons who visit the banks of\r\nthe Ohio, Missouri, or Mississippi rivers and similar localities, almost\r\ninvariably suffer from some form of gastric or intestinal disease. Water\r\nstanding in close rooms soon becomes unfit to drink and should not be\r\nused. A drink of cold water taken on going to bed, and another on rising\r\nare conducive to health, especially in the case of persons troubled with\r\nconstipation. \"_Drink water_\" said the celebrated Dubois to the young\r\npersons who consulted him, \"_drink water, I tell you!_\" Du Moulin, the\r\ngreat medical authority of his time, wrote, just previous to his death,\r\n\"_I leave two great physicians behind me--diet and water_.\"\r\n\r\nTEA AND COFFEE. These substances are almost universally used as\r\nbeverages, and when properly employed, serve a four-fold purpose: they\r\nquench thirst, excite an agreeable exhilaration, repress the waste of\r\nthe system, and supply nourishment. In consequence of being generally\r\nused at meal times, their stimulant properties are employed to promote\r\ndigestion, and consequently they are not so objectionable as they might\r\notherwise be. The liquids introduced into the stomach at meal times\r\nshould not be cold. Tea and coffee are drunk warm, while water, except\r\nin a few instances, is always drunk cold, the effects of which have\r\nalready been shown. That their inordinate use may be injurious no body\r\ncan deny, but this is equally true of other beverages, even pure, cold\r\nwater. Scientific investigators inform us that the use of these agents\r\nas beverages, when judiciously employed, is not injurious. It has been\r\nurged that they are poisonous, but if they are, they are very slow in\r\ntheir operation.\r\n\r\nWhen properly prepared, they are very agreeable beverages, and as man\r\nwill drink more or less at meals, they are allowable; for if their use\r\nwere excluded, some other beverage would be sought after, and quite\r\nlikely one of an alcoholic character employed, so of two evils, if this\r\nbe an evil, let us choose the least. Unlike alcoholic stimulants, they\r\nexhilarate without a depressing reaction after their influence has\r\npassed off. But one cup should be drunk at a meal, and it should be of\r\nmoderate strength. The use of large quantities of drink at meals retards\r\ndigestion by diluting the digestive fluids. The excessive use of large\r\nquantities of strong tea or coffee stimulates the brain and causes\r\nwakefulness, and produces irritability of the nervous system. When they\r\nare productive of such effects, their use is injurious, and should be\r\nconsiderably moderated or wholly discontinued. No criterion can be given\r\nby which the amount the system will tolerate can be regulated. What one\r\nperson may take with impunity, may be deleterious to an other.\r\nIndividuals differ greatly in this respect. There are some who cannot\r\ntolerate them at all, either because of some peculiarity of\r\nconstitution, or on account of disease. And sometimes when tea is\r\nagreeable and beneficial, coffee disagrees with the individual and _vice\r\nversa._ Persons of nervous habits whether natural or acquired, are apt\r\nto find their wakefulness and irritability increased by the use of tea,\r\nparticularly if strong, while coffee will have a tranquilizing effect.\r\nPersons of a lymphatic or bilious temperament often find that coffee\r\ndisagrees with them, aggravating their troubles and causing biliousness,\r\nconstipation, and headache, while tea proves agreeable and beneficial.\r\nWhenever they disagree with the system, the best rule is to abandon\r\ntheir use. We find many persons who do not use either, and yet enjoy\r\nhealth, a fact which proves that they are not by any means\r\nindispensable, and, no doubt, were it customary to go without them,\r\ntheir absence would be but slightly missed.\r\n\r\nTea and coffee are adulterated to a very great extent, and persons using\r\nthem will be greatly imposed upon. This is an evil we cannot remedy. If\r\npeople make use of them, their experience in selecting them must be\r\ntheir guide; however, it is believed that the Black and Japan varieties\r\nof tea are the least apt to be adulterated, and coffee, to insure\r\npurity, should be purchased in the berry, and ground by the purchaser.\r\n\r\nIn preparing tea an infusion should be made by adding boiling water to\r\nthe leaves, and permitting them to steep for a few minutes only, for a\r\nconcentrated decoction, made by boiling for a long time, liberates the\r\nastringent and bitter principles and drives off the agreeable aroma\r\nwhich resides in a volatile oil.\r\n\r\nCoffee should be prepared by adding cold water to the ground berry, and\r\nraising it slowly to the boiling point. Long-continued boiling liberates\r\nthe astringent and bitter principles upon which its stimulant effects to\r\na great extent depend, and drives off with the steam the aromatic oil\r\nfrom which the agreeable taste is derived.\r\n\r\n\r\nALCOHOLIC LIQUORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are divided into three classes: malted, fermented, and distilled.\r\nThey all contain more or less alcohol, and their effects are, therefore,\r\nin some respects similar, and, in the words of Dr. B.W. Richardson, the\r\ngreat English authority on hygiene: \"To say this man only drinks ale,\r\nthat man only drinks wine, while a third drinks spirits, is merely to\r\nsay, when the apology is unclothed, that all drink the same danger. * *\r\nAlcohol is a universal intoxicant, and in the higher orders of animals\r\nis capable of inducing the most systematic phenomena of disease. But it\r\nis reserved for man himself to exhibit these phenomena in their purest\r\nform, and to present, through them, in the morbid conditions belonging\r\nto his age, a distinct pathology. Bad as this is, it might be worse; for\r\nif the evils of alcohol were made to extend equally to animals lower\r\nthan man, we should soon have, none that were tameable, none that were\r\nworkable, and none that were eatable.\" Researches have shown that the\r\nproportion of half a drachm of alcohol to the pound weight of the body,\r\nis the quantity which usually produces intoxication, and that an\r\nincrease of this amount to one drachm immediately endangers the life of\r\nthe individual. The first symptom which attracts attention, when alcohol\r\ncommences to take effect upon the body, is an increase in the number of\r\nthe pulsations of the heart. Dr. Parkes and Count Wolowicz conducted a\r\nseries of interesting experiments on young adult men. They counted the\r\npulsations of the heart, at regular intervals, during periods when the\r\nsubject drank only water; and then they counted the beats of the heart\r\nin the same individual during successive periods in which alcohol was\r\ndrunk in increasing quantities.\r\n\r\nThe following details are taken from their report:\r\n\r\n\"The highest of the daily means of the pulse observed during the first\r\nor water period was 77.5; but on this day two observations were\r\ndeficient. The next highest daily mean was 77 beats.\r\n\r\nIf instead of the mean of the eight days, or 73.57, we compare the mean\r\nof this one day, viz., 77 beats per minute, with the alcoholic days, so\r\nas to be sure not to over-estimate the action of the alcohol, we find:\r\n\r\n    On the ninth day, with one fluid ounce of alcohol,\r\n      the heart beat 430 times more.\r\n    On the tenth day, with two fluid ounces, 1,872 times more.\r\n    On the eleventh day, with four fluid ounces, 12,960 times more.\r\n    On the twelfth day, with six fluid ounces, 30,672 times more.\r\n    On the thirteenth day, with eight fluid ounces, 23,904 times more.\r\n    On the fourteenth day, with eight fluid ounces, 25,488 times more.\r\n\r\nBut as there was ephemeral fever on the twelfth day, it is right to make\r\na deduction, and to estimate the number of beats in that day as midway\r\nbetween the twelfth and twenty-third days, or 18,432. Adopting this, the\r\nmean daily excess of beats during the alcoholic days was 14,492, or an\r\nincrease of rather more than thirteen per cent.\r\n\r\nThe first day of alcohol gave an excess of one per cent., and the last\r\nof twenty-three per cent.; and the mean of these two gives almost the\r\nsame percentage of excess as the mean of the six days.\r\n\r\nAdmitting that each beat of the heart was as strong during the alcoholic\r\nas in the water period (and it was really more powerful), the heart on\r\nthe last two days of alcohol was doing one-fifth more work.\r\n\r\nAdopting the lowest estimate which has been given of the daily work done\r\nby the heart, viz., as equal to 122 tons lifted one foot, the heart,\r\nduring the alcoholic period, did daily work in excess equal to lifting\r\n15.8 tons one foot, and in the last two days did extra work to the\r\namount of twenty-four tons lifted as far.\r\n\r\nThe period of rest for the heart was shortened, though, perhaps, not to\r\nsuch an extent as would be inferred from the number of beats; for each\r\ncontraction was sooner over. The beat on the fifth and sixth days after\r\nalcohol was left off, and apparently at the time when the last traces of\r\nalcohol were eliminated, showed, in the sphygmographic tracing, signs of\r\nunusual feebleness; and, perhaps, in consequence of this, when the\r\nbrandy quickened the heart again, the tracing showed a more rapid\r\ncontraction of the ventricles, but less power than in the alcoholic\r\nperiod. The brandy acted, in fact, on a heart whose nutrition had not\r\nbeen perfectly restored.\"\r\n\r\nThe flush often seen on the cheeks of those who are under the influence\r\nof alcoholic liquors, and which is produced by a relaxed and distended\r\ncondition of the superficial blood vessels, is erroneously supposed by\r\nmany to merely extend to the parts exposed to view. On this subject, Dr.\r\nRichardson says: \"If the lungs could be seen, they, too, would be found\r\nwith their vessels injected; if the brain and spinal cord could be laid\r\nopen to view, they would be discovered in the same condition; if the\r\nstomach, the liver, the spleen, the kidneys, or any other vascular\r\norgans or parts could be laid open to the eye, the vascular engorgement\r\nwould be equally manifest. In the lower animals I have been able to\r\nwitness this extreme vascular condition in the lungs, and once I had the\r\nunusual, though unhappy opportunity of observing the same phenomenon in\r\nthe brain of a man who, in a paroxysm of alcoholic delirium, cast\r\nhimself under the wheels of a railway carriage. The brain,\r\ninstantaneously thrown out from the skull by the crash, was before me\r\nwithin three minutes after the accident. It exhaled the odor of spirit\r\nmost distinctly, and its membranes and minute structures were vascular\r\nin the extreme. It looked as if it had been recently injected with\r\nvermilion injection. The white matter of the cerebrum, studded with red\r\npoints, could scarcely be distinguished when it was incised, it was so\r\npreternaturally red; and the pia mater, or internal vascular membrane\r\ncovering the brain, resembled a delicate web of coagulated red blood, so\r\ntensely were its fine vessels engorged. This condition extended through\r\nboth the larger and the smaller brain, cerebrum, and cerebellum, but was\r\nnot so marked in the medulla, or commencing portion of the spinal cord,\r\nas in the other portions.\r\n\r\nIn course of time, in persons accustomed to alcohol, the vascular\r\nchanges, temporary only in the novitiate, become confirmed and\r\npermanent. The bloom on the nose which characterizes the genial toper is\r\nthe established sign of alcoholic action on the vascular structure.\r\n\r\nRecently, physiological research has served to explain the reason why,\r\nunder alcohol the heart at first beats so quickly, why the pulse rises,\r\nand why the minute blood-vessels become so strongly injected.\r\n\r\nAt one time it was imagined that alcohol acts immediately upon the heart\r\nby stimulating it to increased motion; and from this idea,--false idea,\r\nI should say,--of the primary action of alcohol, many erroneous\r\nconclusions have been drawn. We have now learned that there exist many\r\nchemical bodies which act in the same manner as alcohol, and that their\r\neffect is not to stimulate the heart, but to weaken the contractile\r\nforce of the extreme and minute vessels which the heart fills with blood\r\nat each of its strokes. These bodies produce, in fact, a paralysis of\r\nthe organic nervous supply of the vessels which constitute the minute\r\nvascular structures. The minute vessels when paralysed offer inefficient\r\nresistance to the force of the heart, and the pulsating organ thus\r\nliberated, like the main-spring of a clock from which the resistance has\r\nbeen removed, quickens in action, dilating the feebly resistant vessels,\r\nand giving evidence really not of increased, but of wasted power.\"\r\n\r\nThe continued use of alcoholic liquors in any considerable quantity\r\nproduces irritation and inflammation of the stomach, and structural\r\ndisease of the liver. Dr. Hammond has shown that alcohol has a special\r\naffinity for nervous matter, and is, therefore, found in greater\r\nquantity in the brain and spinal cord than elsewhere in the body. The\r\ngray matter of the brain undergoes, to a certain extent, a fatty\r\ndegeneration, and there is a shrinking of the whole cerebrum, with\r\nimpairment of the intellectual faculties, muscular tremor, and a\r\nshambling gait.\r\n\r\nLarge doses of alcohol cause a diminution of the temperature of the\r\nbody, which in fevers is more marked than in the normal state.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the organic diseases enumerated above, and delirium\r\ntremens, the following diseases are frequently the result of the\r\nexcessive use of alcoholic liquors: epilepsy, paralysis, insanity,\r\ndiabetes, gravel, and diseases of the heart and blood-vessels.\r\n\r\nThe physiological deductions of Dr. Richardson are so much in accord\r\nwith our own that we quote them in full:\r\n\r\n\"In the first place we gather from the physiological reading of the\r\naction of alcohol that the agent is narcotic. I have compared it\r\nthroughout to chloroform, and the comparison is good in all respects\r\nsave one, viz.: that alcohol is less fatal than chloroform as an instant\r\ndestroyer. It kills certainly in its own way, but its method of killing\r\nis slow, indirect, and by disease.\r\n\r\nThe well-proven fact that alcohol, when it is taken into the body,\r\nreduces the animal temperature, is full of the most important\r\nsuggestions. The fact shows that alcohol does not in any sense act as a\r\nsupplier of vital heat as is commonly supposed, and that it does not\r\nprevent the loss of heat as those imagine 'who take just a drop to keep\r\nout the cold,' It shows, on the contrary, that cold and alcohol, in\r\ntheir effects on the body, run closely together, an opinion confirmed by\r\nthe experience of those who live or travel in cold regions of the earth.\r\nThe experiences of the Arctic voyagers, of the leaders of the great\r\nNapoleonic campaigns in Russia, of the good monks of St. Bernard, all\r\ntestify that death from cold is accelerated by its ally alcohol.\r\nExperiments with alcohol in extreme cold tell the like story, while the\r\nchilliness of the body which succeeds upon even a moderate excess of\r\nalcoholic indulgence leads directly to the same indication of truth.\r\n\r\nThe conclusive evidence now in our possession that alcohol taken into\r\nthe animal body sets free the heart, so as to cause the excess of motion\r\nof which the record has been given above, is proof that the heart, under\r\nthe frequent influence of alcohol, must undergo deleterious change of\r\nstructure. It may, indeed, be admitted in proper fairness, that when the\r\nheart is passing through these rapid movements it is working under less\r\npressure than when its movements are slow and natural; and this\r\nallowance must needs be made, or the inference would be that the organ\r\nought to stop at once, in function, by the excess of strain put upon it.\r\nAt the same time the excess of motion is injurious to the heart and to\r\nthe body at large; it subjects the heart to irregularity of supply of\r\nblood, it subjects the body in all its parts to the same injurious\r\ninfluence; it weakens, and, as a necessary sequence, degrades both the\r\nheart and the body.\r\n\r\nSpeaking honestly, I cannot, by any argument yet presented to me, admit\r\nthe alcohols by any sign that should distinguish them from other\r\nchemical substances of the paralysing narcotic class. When it is\r\nphysiologically understood that what is called stimulation or excitement\r\nis, in absolute fact, a relaxation, a partial paralysis, of one of the\r\nmost important mechanisms in the animal body, the minute, resisting,\r\ncompensating circulation, we grasp quickly the error in respect to the\r\naction of stimulants in which we have been educated, and obtain a clear\r\nsolution of the well-known experience that all excitement, all passion,\r\nleaves, after its departure, lowness of heart, depression of mind,\r\nsadness of spirit. We learn, then, in respect to alcohol, that the\r\ntemporary excitement it produces is at the expense of the animal force,\r\nand that the ideas of its being necessary to resort to it, that it may\r\nlift up the forces of the animal body into true and firm and even\r\nactivity, or that it may add something useful to the living tissues, are\r\nerrors as solemn as they are widely disseminated. In the scientific\r\neducation of the people no fact is more deserving of special comment\r\nthan this fact, that excitement is wasted force, the running down of the\r\nanimal mechanism before it has served out its time of motion.\r\n\r\nIt will be said that alcohol cheers the weary, and that to take a little\r\nwine for the stomach's sake is one of the lessons that comes from the\r\ndeep recesses of human nature. I am not so obstinate as to deny this\r\nargument, There are times in the life of man when the heart is\r\noppressed, when the resistance to its motion is excessive, and when\r\nblood flows languidly to the centres of life, nervous and muscular. In\r\nthese moments alcohol cheers. It lets loose the heart from its\r\noppression; it lets flow a brisker current of blood into the failing\r\norgans; it aids nutritive changes, and altogether is of temporary\r\nservice to man. So far, alcohol may be good, and if its use could be\r\nlimited to this one action, this one purpose, it would be amongst the\r\nmost excellent of the gifts of science to mankind. Unhappily, the border\r\nline between this use and the abuse of it, the temptation to extend\r\nbeyond the use, the habit to apply the use when it is not wanted as\r\nreadily as when it is wanted, overbalance, in the multitude of men, the\r\ntemporary value that attaches truly to alcohol as a physiological agent.\r\nHence alcohol becomes a dangerous instrument even in the hands of the\r\nstrong and wise, a murderous instrument in the hands of the foolish and\r\nweak. Used too frequently, used too excessively, this agent, which in\r\nmoderation cheers the failing body, relaxes its vessels too extremely;\r\nspoils vital organs; makes the force of the circulation slow, imperfect,\r\nirregular; suggests the call for more stimulation; tempts to renewal of\r\nthe evil, and ruins the mechanism of the healthy animal before its hour\r\nfor ruin, by natural decay, should be at all near.\r\n\r\nIt is assumed by most persons that alcohol gives strength, and we hear\r\nfeeble persons saying daily that they are being 'kept up by stimulants.'\r\nThis means actually that they are being kept down; but the sensation\r\nthey derive from the immediate action of the stimulant deceives them and\r\nleads them to attribute passing good to what, in the large majority of\r\ncases, is persistent evil. The evidence is all-perfect that alcohol\r\ngives no potential power to brain or muscle. During the first stage of\r\naction it may enable a wearied or a feeble organism to do brisk work for\r\na short time; it may make the mind briefly brilliant; it may excite\r\nmuscle to quick action, but it does nothing substantially, and fills up\r\nnothing it has destroyed, as it leads to destruction. A fire makes a\r\nbrilliant sight, but leaves a desolation. It is the same with alcohol.\r\n\r\nOn the muscular force the very slightest excess of alcoholic influence\r\nis injurious. I find by measuring the power of muscle for contraction in\r\nthe natural state and under alcohol, that so soon as there is a distinct\r\nindication of muscular disturbance, there is also indication of muscular\r\nfailure, and if I wished by scientific experiment to spoil for work the\r\nmost perfect specimen of a working animal, say a horse, without\r\ninflicting mechanical injury, I could choose no better agent for the\r\npurpose of the experiment than alcohol. But alas! the readiness with\r\nwhich strong, well-built men slip into general paralysis under the\r\ncontinued influence of this false support, attests how unnecessary it\r\nwould be to subject a lower animal to the experiment. The experiment is\r\na custom, and man is the subject.\r\n\r\nThe true place of alcohol is clear; it is an agreeable temporary shroud.\r\nThe savage, with the mansions of his soul unfurnished, buries his\r\nrestless energy under its shadow. The civilized man overburdened with\r\nmental labor, or with engrossing care, seeks the same shade; but it is\r\nshade, after all, in which, in exact proportion as he seeks it, the\r\nseeker retires from perfect natural life. To search for force in alcohol\r\nis, to my mind, equivalent to the act of seeking for the sun in\r\nsubterranean gloom until all is night.\r\n\r\nIt may be urged that men take alcohol, nevertheless, take it freely, and\r\nyet live; that the adult Swede drinks his average cup of twenty-five\r\ngallons of alcohol per year and remains on the face of the earth. I\r\nadmit force even in this argument, for I know under the persistent use\r\nof alcohol there is a limited provision for the continuance of life. In\r\nthe confirmed alcoholic the alcohol is, in a certain sense, so disposed\r\nof that it fits, as it were, the body for a long season, nay, becomes\r\npart of it; and yet it is silently doing its fatal work. The organs of\r\nthe body may be slowly brought into a state of adaptation to receive it\r\nand to dispose of it. But in that very preparation they are themselves\r\nmade to undergo physical changes tending to the destruction of their\r\nfunction, to perversion of their structure, and to all those varied\r\nmodifications of organic parts which the dissector of the human subject\r\nlearns to recognize,--almost without concern, and certainly without\r\nanything more than commonplace curiosity,--as the devastations incident\r\nto alcoholic indulgence.\"\r\n\r\nThe statistics collected from the census of the United States for 1860,\r\nand given by Dr. De Marmon, in the _New York Medical Journal_ for\r\nDecember, 1870, must carry conviction to all minds of the correctness of\r\nthe foregoing deductions:\r\n\r\n\"For the last ten years the use of spirits has, 1. Imposed on the nation\r\na direct expense of 600,000,000 dollars. 2. Has caused an indirect\r\nexpense of 600,000,000 dollars. 3. Has destroyed 300,000 lives. 4. Has\r\nsent 100,000 children to the poorhouses. 5. Has committed at least\r\n150,000 people into prisons and workhouses. 6. Has made at least 1,000\r\ninsane. 7. Has determined at least 2,000 suicides. 8. Has caused the\r\nloss by fire or violence, of at least 10,000,000 dollars' worth of\r\nproperty. 9. Has made 200,000 widows and 1,000 orphans.\"\r\n\r\nIf these were the statistics twenty-four years ago, with our greatly\r\nincreased population, what must they be to-day? We will let the reader\r\ndraw his own conclusions.\r\n\r\nMALTED LIQUORS. Under this head are included all those liquors into the\r\ncomposition of which malt enters, such as beer, ale, and porter. The\r\nproportion of alcohol in these liquors varies greatly. In beer, it is\r\nfrom two to five per cent.; in Edinburgh ale, it amounts to six per\r\ncent.; in porter, it is usually from four to six per cent. In addition\r\nto alcohol and water, the malted liquors contain from five to fourteen\r\nper cent. of the extract of malt, and from 0.16 to 0.60 per cent. of\r\ncarbonic acid. They possess, according to Pereira, three properties:\r\nthey quench thirst; they stimulate, cheer, and, if taken in sufficient\r\nquantity, intoxicate; and they nourish or strengthen. The first of these\r\nqualities is due to the water entering into their composition; the\r\nsecond, to the alcohol; the third is attributed the nutritive principles\r\nof the malt.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIONS TO THEIR USE AS BEVERAGES. These articles are either pure or\r\nadulterated. In their pure state the objection to their use for this\r\npurpose lies in the fact that they contain alcohol. This, as we have\r\nseen, is a poisonous substance, which the human system in a state of\r\nhealth does not need. Its use, when the body is in a normal condition,\r\nis uncalled for, and can only be deleterious. Beverages containing this\r\npoison are more or less deleterious to healthy persons, according to the\r\namount of it which they contain.\r\n\r\nThese liquors are frequently adulterated, and this increases their\r\ninjurious effects. The ingenuity of man has been taxed to increase their\r\nintoxicating properties; to heighten the color and flavor, to create\r\npungency and thirst; and to revive old beer. To increase the\r\nintoxicating power, tobacco or the seeds of the Cocculus indicus are\r\nadded; to heighten the color and flavor, burnt sugar, liquorice, or\r\ntreacle, quassia, or strychnine, coriander, and caraway seeds are\r\nemployed; to increase the pungency, cayenne pepper or common salt is\r\nadded; to revive old beer, or ale, it is shaken up with green vitriol or\r\nsulphate of iron, or with alum and common salt.\r\n\r\nFERMENTED LIQUORS. These are cider and wine. Cider contains alcohol to\r\nthe amount of from five to ten per cent., saccharine matter, lactic\r\nacid, and other substances. New cider may be drunk in large quantities\r\nwithout inducing intoxication, but old cider is quite as intoxicating as\r\nale or porter.\r\n\r\nThe composition of wine is very complex, the peculiar qualities which\r\ncharacterize the different varieties cannot be ascertained by chemical\r\nanalysis. Wine is a solution of alcohol in water, combined with various\r\nconstituents of the grape. The amount of alcohol in wines ranges from\r\nsix to forty per cent. As beverages, these are open to the same\r\nobjections as those manufactured from malt. As a medicine, wine is a\r\nuseful remedy. Concerning its use in this capacity, Prof. Liebig says:\r\n\"Wine is a restorative. As a means of refreshment when the powers of\r\nlife are exhausted--as a means of compensation where a misappropriation\r\noccurs in nutrition, and as a means of protection against transient\r\norganic disturbances, it is surpassed by no product of nature or art.\"\r\nThat an article is useful in medicine, however, is no reason why it\r\nshould be used as a beverage by those in health. It is rather an\r\nargument against such a practice. For it is generally true that the\r\ndrugs used to restore the diseased system to health, are pernicious or\r\npoisonous to it when in a normal condition.\r\n\r\nDISTILLED LIQUORS. These are whiskey, brandy, and the kindred\r\nproductions of the still. Whiskey is a solution of alcohol in water,\r\nmixed with various other principles which impart to it peculiar physical\r\nproperties. The amount of alcohol which it contains varies from\r\nforty-eight to fifty-six per cent. Old whiskey is more highly prized\r\nthan the more recent product of the still, from the fact that when kept\r\nfor some years certain volatile oils are generated which, impart to it a\r\nmellowness of flavor.\r\n\r\nBrandy is a solution of alcohol in water, together with various other\r\nsubstances. It contains from fifty to fifty-six per cent. of alcohol.\r\nPure brandy is distilled from wine, 1,000 gallons of wine yielding from\r\n100 to 150 gallons of brandy, but a very large proportion of the brandy\r\nis made with little or no wine. It is made artificially from high wines\r\nby the addition of oil of Cognac, to give it flavor, burnt sugar to give\r\nit color, and logwood or catechu, to impart astringency and roughness of\r\ntaste. The best brandy is obtained by distillation from the best quality\r\nof white wines, from the districts of Cognac and Armagnac in France.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CLOTHING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no physical agent which exerts a more constant or more powerful\r\ninfluence upon health and life, than the atmosphere. The climate in\r\nthese latitudes is exceedingly variable, ranging all the way from 110°\r\nFahr. in summer to 40° below zero in the winter season. The body of\r\nevery individual should be so protected from cold, that it can maintain\r\na mean temperature of 98° Fahr.\r\n\r\nWhen the body is warm there is a free and equal circulation of the blood\r\nthroughout all the structures. When the surface is subjected to cold,\r\nthe numerous capillaries and minute vessels carrying the blood, contract\r\nand diminish in size, increasing the amount of this fluid in the\r\ninternal organs, thus causing congestion. The blood must go somewhere,\r\nand if driven from the surface, it retreats to the cavities within.\r\nHence this repletion of the vital organs causes pain from pressure and\r\nfullness of the distended blood-vessels, and the organic functions are\r\nembarrassed. Besides, cold upon the surface shuts up the pores of the\r\nskin, which are among the most active and important excretory ducts of\r\nthe system. It is evident, then, that we require suitable clothing, not\r\nonly for comfort, but to maintain the temperature and functions\r\nessential to health and life.\r\n\r\nThe chief object to be attained by dress is the maintenance of a uniform\r\ntemperature of the body. To attain this end, it is necessary that the\r\nexhalations of the system, which are continually escaping through the\r\npores of the skin, should be absorbed or conducted away from the person.\r\nThese exudations occur in the form of sensible or insensible\r\nperspiration, and the clothing, to be healthy, should be so porous as to\r\nallow them freely to escape into the air.\r\n\r\nA substance should also be chosen which is known to be a poor conductor\r\nof heat. That generated by the system will thus be retained where it is\r\nneeded, instead of being dispersed into the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nWe might add that the better the material for accomplishing these\r\npurposes, the less will be needed to be worn; for we do not wish to wear\r\nor carry about with us any more material than is necessary. It so\r\nhappens that all of these qualities are found combined in _flannel_. The\r\nvalue of this article worn next to the skin cannot be over-rated, for\r\nwhile it affords protection from cold during the winter months, it is\r\nequally beneficial during the heat of summer, because it imbibes the\r\nperspiration, and being very porous, allows it to escape. The skin\r\nalways feels soft, smooth, and pliable, when it is worn; but, when\r\ncotton takes its place, it soon becomes dry and harsh. Its natural\r\nadaptability to these purposes, shows that it is equally a comfort and a\r\nsource of health. Where the skin is very delicate, flannel sometimes\r\ncauses irritation. In such cases a thin fabric of linen, cotton, or\r\nsilk, should be worn next the skin, with flannel immediately over it.\r\nWhere there is a uniform and extreme degree of heat, cotton and linen\r\nare very conducive to comfort. But they are unsuitable in a climate or\r\nseason liable to sudden fluctuations in temperature.\r\n\r\nThe value of furs, where people are exposed to extreme cold, cannot be\r\noverestimated. They are much warmer than wool, and are chiefly used as\r\nwraps on going outdoors. They are too cumbrous and expensive for\r\nordinary wear in this latitude, but in places near the poles they\r\nconstitute the chief clothing of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of clothing worn is another important item. The least that\r\nis necessary to keep the body well protected and evenly tempered when\r\nemployed is the rule of health. Some people, instead of wearing flannels\r\nnext to the body, put on other material in greater abundance, thus\r\nconfining the perspiration to the skin and making the body chilly. The\r\namount of clothing is then increased, until they are so heavily clad\r\nthat they cannot exercise. It is far better to wear one thickness of\r\nflannel next to the skin, and then cotton, or woolen, for outside\r\ngarments, and be able to exercise, thus allowing the blood to circulate\r\nand to assist in the warming process.\r\n\r\nOne great fault in dress consists in neglecting to properly clothe the\r\nupper extremities. Some people do not reflect upon the necessity, while\r\nothers are too proud to be directed by plain common sense. In the winter\r\nseason, the feet should be covered with woolen stockings. The next\r\nmatter of importance, is to get a thick, broad-soled shoe, so large that\r\nit will not prevent the free circulation of the blood. Then for walking,\r\nand especially for riding, when the earth is wet and cold, or when there\r\nis snow on the ground, wear a flannel-lined rubber or \"Arctic\"\r\nover-shoe. _Be sure and keep the feet comfortable and warm at all\r\ntimes._\r\n\r\nOur next advice is to keep the legs warm. We were called not long ago,\r\nto see a young lady who had contracted a severe cold. She had been to an\r\nentertainment where the apartments were nicely warmed, and from thence\r\nhad walked home late in the evening. We inquired into the circumstances\r\nof the case, and ascertained that she wore flannel about her chest, and\r\nthat she also wore rubbers over her shoes, but the other portions of the\r\nlower extremities were protected by cotton coverings. In short, her legs\r\nwere not kept warm, and she took cold by going out from warm rooms into\r\na chilly atmosphere. A good pair of woolen leggings might have saved her\r\nmuch suffering. The results of insufficient protection of the lower\r\nextremities are colds, coughs, consumption, headaches, pain in the side,\r\nmenstrual derangements, uterine congestion and disorders, besides\r\ndisablement for the ordinary and necessary duties of life. All these may\r\nbe prevented by clothing the legs suitably, and wearing comfortable\r\nflannels.\r\n\r\nYoung people can bear a low temperature of the body better than old\r\npeople, because they possess greater power of endurance. But that is no\r\nreason for unnecessary exposure.\r\n\r\nThe amount of clothing should be regulated according to the\r\nheat-generating power of the individual, and also according to the\r\nsusceptibility to cold. No two persons are exactly alike in these\r\nrespects. But it is never proper for young people to reject the counsels\r\nof experience, or treat lightly the advice to protect themselves\r\nthoroughly against the cold. Many a parent's heart has ached as he has\r\nfollowed the mortal remains of a darling child to the grave, knowing\r\nthat if good advice had been heeded, in all human probability, the life\r\nwould have been prolonged.\r\n\r\nThe most deleterious mechanical errors in clothing are those which\r\naffect the chest and body. Tight lacing still plays too important a part\r\nin dress. It interferes with the free and healthy movements of the body,\r\nand effects a pressure which is alike injurious to the organs of\r\nrespiration, circulation, and digestion. The great muscle of\r\nrespiration, the diaphragm, is impeded in its motion, and is, therefore,\r\nunable to act freely. The large blood-vessels are compressed, and when\r\nthe pressure is excessive the heart and lungs are also subjected to\r\nrestraint and thrown out of their proper positions. From the compression\r\nof the liver and stomach, the functions of digestion are impeded, a\r\ndistaste for solid food, flatulency and pain after eating are the\r\nunmistakable proofs of the injury which is being inflicted.\r\n\r\nThe evil effects of such pressure are not confined to actual periods of\r\ntime during which this pressure is applied. They continue after it has\r\nbeen removed and when the chest and trunk of the body have thus been\r\nsubjected to long-continued pressure they become permanently deformed.\r\nThese deformities necessarily entail great suffering in child-bearing.\r\n\r\nThe evil effects of mechanical pressure on other parts of the body are\r\nnot uncommon. The leg is sometimes so indented by a tight garter that\r\nthe returning flow of blood through the veins is prevented, and a\r\nvaricose condition of these vessels is produced.\r\n\r\nIrregular and excessive pressure on the foot by imperfectly fitting\r\nshoes or boots produce deformities of the feet and cause much suffering.\r\nThe high heels which are so common on the shoes of women and children\r\ninflict more than a local injury. Every time the body comes down upon\r\nthe raised heel with its full weight a slight shock or vibration is\r\ncommunicated throughout the entire extent of the spinal column, and the\r\nnervous mechanism is thereby injured. Furthermore, displacements of the\r\npelvic organs frequently result from these unnatural and absurd articles\r\nof dress. Women of fashion are subjected to much annoyance from wearing\r\nlong, flowing skirts suspended from their waists to trail uselessly on\r\nthe floor and gather dust. It is impossible for the wearers of these\r\nridiculous garments to exercise their limbs properly or to breathe\r\nnaturally. Indigestion, palpitation, shortness of breath, and physical\r\ndegeneracy are the inevitable consequences of their folly. The skirts\r\nshould always be suspended from the shoulders and not from the hips. It\r\nis especially important that the clothing of children should not fit too\r\ntightly.\r\n\r\nIt is very important that the clothing should be kept clean. That which\r\nis worn for a long time becomes saturated with the excretions and\r\nexhalations of the body, which prevent free transpiration from the pores\r\nof the skin, and thereby induce mental inactivity and depression of the\r\nphysical powers. Unclear clothing may be the means of conveying disease.\r\nScarlet fever has been conveyed frequently by the clothing of a nurse\r\ninto a healthy family. All of the contagious diseases have been\r\ncommunicated by clothing contaminated in laundries.\r\n\r\nCertain dyes which are largely used in the coloring of wearing apparel\r\nare poisonous, and give rise to local disease of the skin, accompanied\r\nin some instances, with constitutional symptoms. The principal poisonous\r\ndyes are the red and yellow aniline. A case of poisoning from wearing\r\nstockings colored with aniline dyes, in which there were severe\r\nconstitutional symptoms, came under our observation at the Invalids'\r\nHotel recently.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL EXERCISE. MENTAL CULTURE. SLEEP. CLEANLINESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA well-developed physical organization is essential to perfect health.\r\nAmong the Greeks, beauty ranked next to virtue, and an eminent author\r\nhas said that \"the nearer we approach Divinity, the more we reflect His\r\neternal beauty.\" The perfect expression of thought requires the physical\r\naccompaniments of language, gesture, etc. The human form is pliable,\r\nand, with proper culture, can be made replete with expression, grace and\r\nbeauty. The cultivation of the intellectual powers has been allowed to\r\nsupplant physical training to a great extent. The results are abnormally\r\ndeveloped brains, delicate forms, sensitive nerves and shortened lives.\r\nThat the physical and mental systems should be collaterally developed,\r\nis a fact generally overlooked by educators. The fullness of a great\r\nintellect is generally impaired when united with a weak and frail body.\r\nWe have sought perfection in animals and plants. To the former we have\r\ngiven all the degree of strength and grace requisite to their peculiar\r\nduties; to the latter we have imparted all the delicate tints and\r\nshadings that fancy could picture. We have studied the laws of their\r\nexistence, until we are familiar with every phase of their production;\r\nyet it remains for man to learn those laws of his own being, by a\r\nknowledge of which he may promote and preserve the beauty of the human\r\nform, and thus render it, indeed, an image of its Maker. When the body\r\nis tenanted by a cultivated intellect, the result is a unity which is\r\nunique, commanding the respect of humanity, and insuring a successful\r\nlife to the possessor. Students are as a rule pale and emaciated. Mental\r\napplication is generally the cause assigned when, in reality, it is the\r\nresult of insufficient exercise, impure air, and dietetic errors. An\r\nintelligent journalist has remarked that \"many of our ministers weigh\r\ntoo little in the pulpit, because they weigh too little on the scales.\"\r\nThe Greek Gymnasium and Olympian Games were the sure foundations of that\r\neducation from which arose that subtle philosophy, poetry, and military\r\nskill which have won the admiration of nineteen centuries. The laurel\r\ncrown of the Olympian victor was far more precious to the Grecian youth\r\nthan the gilded prize is to our modern genius. A popular lecturer has\r\ntruly remarked, that \"we make brilliant mathematicians and miserable\r\ndyspeptics; fine linguists with bronchial throats; good writers with\r\nnarrow chests and pale complexions; smart scholars, but not that union,\r\nwhich the ancients prized, of a sound mind in a sound body. The brain\r\nbecomes the chief working muscle of the system. We refine and re-refine\r\nthe intellectual powers down to a diamond point and brilliancy, as if\r\nthey were the sole or reigning faculties, and we had not a physical\r\nnature binding us to earth, and a spiritual nature binding us to the\r\ngreat heavens and the greater God who inhabits them. Thus the university\r\nbecomes a sort of splendid hospital with this difference, that the\r\nhospital _cures_, while the university _creates_ disease. Most of them\r\nare indicted at the bar of public opinion for taking the finest young\r\nbrain and blood of the country, and, after working upon them for four\r\nyears, returning them to their homes skilled indeed to perform certain\r\nlinguistic and mathematical dexterities, but very much below par in\r\nhealth and endurance, and, in short, seriously damaged and physically\r\ndemoralized.\" We read with reverence the sublime teachings of Aristotle\r\nand Plato; we mark the grandeur of Homer and the delicate beauties of\r\nVirgil; but we do not seek to reproduce in our modern institutions the\r\ngymnasium, which was the real foundation of their genius. Colleges which\r\nare now entering upon their career, should make ample provision for\r\nthose exercises which develop the _physical man._ This lack of bodily\r\ntraining is common with all classes, and its effects are written in\r\nindelible characters on the faces and forms of old and young.\r\nConstrained positions in sitting restrict the movements of the diaphragm\r\nand ribs and often cause diseases of the spine, or unnatural curvatures,\r\nwhich prove disastrous to health and happiness. The head should be held\r\nerect and the shoulders thrown backward, so that at each inspiration the\r\nlungs may be fully expanded.\r\n\r\nPhysical exercise should never be too violent or too prolonged. Severe\r\nphysical labor, and athletic sports, if indulged in to an extreme\r\ndegree, produce undue excitability of the heart, and sometimes cause it\r\nto become enlarged. There is a form of heart disease induced by undue\r\nexertion which may be called a wearing out or wasting away of that\r\norgan. It is common in those persons whose occupations expose them to\r\nexcessive physical labor for too many hours together. This feebleness of\r\nheart is felt but little by vigorous persons under forty years of age,\r\nbut in those who have passed this age it becomes manifest. However, when\r\nany person so affected is attacked by any acute disease, the heart is\r\nmore liable to fail, and thus cause a fatal termination.\r\n\r\nAneurism of the aorta or the large arteries branching off from it, which\r\nis a dilatation of the walls of these vessels, caused by the rupture of\r\none or two of their coats, is generally induced by excessive physical\r\nstrain, such as lifting heavy weights, or carrying weights up long\r\nflights of stairs, violent horseback exercise, or hurrying to catch a\r\ntrain or street car.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 104.]\r\n\r\nAN ERECT CARRIAGE is not only essential to health, but adds grace and\r\nbeauty to every movement. Although man was made to stand erect, thus\r\nindicating his superiority over all other animals, yet custom has done\r\nmuch to curve that magnificent central column, upon the summit of which\r\nrests the \"grand dome of thought.\" Many young persons unconsciously\r\nacquire the habit of throwing the shoulders forward. The spinal column\r\nis weakened by this unnatural posture, its vertebræ become so sensitive\r\nand distorted that they cannot easily support the weight of the body or\r\nsustain its equilibrium. It is generally believed that persons of\r\nsedentary habits are more liable to become round-shouldered than any\r\nother class of individuals. Observation shows, on the contrary, that the\r\nmanual laborer, or even the idler, often acquires this stooping posture.\r\nIt can be remedied, not by artificial braces, but by habitually throwing\r\nthe shoulders backwards. Deformed trunks and crooked spines, although\r\nsometimes the effects of disease are more frequently the results of\r\ncarelessness. Jacques has remarked that \"one's standing among his\r\nfellow-men is quite as important a matter in a _physiological_, as in a\r\n_social_ sense.\" _Walking_ is one of the most efficient means of\r\nphysical culture, as it calls all the muscles into action and produces\r\nthe amount of tension requisite for their tonicity. Long walks or\r\nprotracted physical exercise of any kind should never be undertaken\r\nimmediately after meals. The first essential to a healthful walk is a\r\npleasurable object. Beautiful scenery, rambles in meadows rich with\r\nfragrant grasses, or along the flowery banks of water-courses, affords\r\nan agreeable stimulus, which sends the blood through the vital channels\r\nwith unwonted force, and imparts to the cheeks the ruddy glow of health.\r\nOur poets acknowledge the silent influence of nature. Wordsworth has\r\nexpressed this thought in his own sublime way:\r\n\r\n    \"The floating clouds their state shall lend\r\n    To her: for her the willow bend;\r\n    Nor shall she fail to see,\r\n    E'en in the motions of the storm\r\n    Grace that shall mould the maiden's form\r\n    By silent sympathy.\r\n    The stars of midnight shall be dear\r\n    To her: and she shall lean her ear\r\n    In many a secret place,\r\n    Where rivulets dance their wayward round,\r\n    And beauty, born of murmuring sound,\r\n    Shall pass into her face.\"\r\n\r\nBASE BALL, CRICKET, BOXING, AND FENCING, are all manly exercises when\r\npracticed solely with a view to their hygienic advantages and as such\r\nhave our approval.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 105.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 109.]\r\n\r\nTHE ART OF SWIMMING was regarded by the Greeks as an important\r\naccomplishment. As a hygienic agency, it occupies a high place in\r\nphysical culture. The varied movements impart strength and elasticity to\r\nthe muscles. It is as charming a recreation for women and girls as for\r\nmen and boys. Furthermore, it is not only a means of physical culture,\r\nbut is often essential for self-preservation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 110.]\r\n\r\nTHE EXERCISES OF THE GYMNASIUM are especially productive of health and\r\nlongevity. The most important of these are balancing, leaping, climbing,\r\nwrestling, and throwing, all of which are especially adapted to the\r\ndevelopment of the muscles. In conclusion, we offer the following\r\nsuggestions, viz: all gymnastic exercises should be practiced in the\r\nmorning, and in the open air; extremes should be avoided; and it should\r\nbe always borne in mind, that their chief object is to combine, in a\r\nproper proportion, mental and physical development. In every relation of\r\nlife we should cultivate all those faculties which pertain to our\r\nphysical, moral, and mental natures, subdue our passions, and nature\r\nwill bestow upon us her richest rewards of health, beauty, and\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\n\r\nCYCLING.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIf one were asked what athletic exercise deserves to be the most popular\r\nin America to-day, the answer would of necessity be cycling. The bicycle\r\nis being used by people of all ages and conditions of health in daily\r\nlife; its hygienic value as a means to healthy exercise cannot be\r\noverestimated. In this, as in everything else, immoderation is to be\r\ncondemned, particularly where persons have not had sufficient training\r\nto take long \"spins,\" or attempt racing. Beginners should ride only 10\r\nor 12 minutes at a time--resting then to permit the circulation to\r\nbecome equalized. In all cyclists, at all ages, in veteran riders as\r\nwell as those not practiced in the art, there is, in the beginning of\r\neach attempt, a quickened circulation; the pulse is full and bounding,\r\nand rarely falls under a hundred pulsations per minute. So long as the\r\nexercise is continued, an increase of cardiac motion is observable, and\r\na vigorous circulation is kept up. This accounts for the astounding\r\njourneys a fully trained cyclist can accomplish, and also for his\r\nendurance without sleep. In spite of the quickened motion of the heart,\r\nrarely have riders been known to grow giddy or show symptoms of cardiac\r\nembarrassment. A good rider may climb a hill without trouble, yet be\r\nunable to climb a flight of stairs without breathlessness and\r\npalpitation. Bicycle riding as a means for acquiring strength and vigor,\r\nimproving the circulation and developing the respiratory organs, is\r\nunexcelled. Fast riding, or \"scorching,\" among those not used to\r\nphysical exertion, and leaning over the handle-bars so as to ride in a\r\nstooping position, are to be heartily condemned. The latter prevents the\r\nlungs from getting their full expansion, and cultivates a tendency to\r\nround shoulders. Men or women suffering from diseases of the sexual\r\norgans should, before riding, consult the physician having their case in\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 112.]\r\n\r\nRIDING ON HORSEBACK is a fine exercise for both sexes. It promotes\r\ndigestion, improves the circulation, and expands and develops the\r\nrespiratory organs. The pure, fresh air, pleasant scenery, and\r\npleasurable excitement, impart renewed vigor to the equestrian. In the\r\nSouthern States it is a universal accomplishment, and children are\r\ntaught to ride as well as to walk.\r\n\r\nDANCING. Notwithstanding the fact that dancing has been perverted to the\r\nbasest purposes, has been made the fruitful source of dissipation, and\r\nhas often laid the foundation for disease, it is yet capable of being\r\nmade to minister to health and happiness. As a means of physical\r\nculture, it favors the development of the muscular system, and promotes\r\nhealth and cheerfulness. When practiced for this purpose, Jacques terms\r\nit \"the best of all indoor exercises,\" as it brings to bear upon the\r\nphysical system a great number of energizing and harmonious influences.\r\n\r\n\r\nMENTAL CULTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe brain, like all other organs of the body, requires alternate\r\nexercise and repose; and, in physical endurance, it is subject to\r\ngeneral physiological laws. When exercised with moderation it acquires\r\nstrength, vigor, and an accelerated activity. Excessive mental exertion\r\nis liable to result in softening of the brain, and various nervous\r\ndiseases, sometimes culminating in insanity, and in many instances\r\nproving fatal to life. The mere votaries of pleasure who avoid all\r\neffort of the mind, fall into the opposite error. In all cases of\r\nintellectual activity, the exertions should be directed to some subject\r\ninteresting to the student. In this manner duty will become a pleasure,\r\nwhich in turn will re-invigorate the mental functions.\r\n\r\nWhen the mind in confined to one subject for any considerable length of\r\ntime together, it becomes fatigued, and requires relaxation, recreation,\r\nrest. This may be obtained by directing the attention to some other\r\nsubject, either study or amusement, the latter of which is preferable.\r\nThe amusement, however, may be of an intellectual or physical character\r\nor both combined, and will, if properly conducted, restore vigor to both\r\nmind and body.\r\n\r\nProminent among physical phenomena is the mutual relation between the\r\nbrain and the organs of nutrition. Mental exertion should be avoided for\r\nat least one hour after a hearty meal, and all mental labor which\r\nrequires concentration of thought ought to be accomplished in the\r\nearlier portion of the day, when the brain is refreshed and repaired by\r\nthe night's repose. Mental, like physical endurance, is modified by age,\r\nhealth and development. A person accustomed to concentration of thought,\r\ncan endure a longer mental strain than one inured to manual labor only.\r\nOne of the most injurious customs, is the cultivation of the intellect\r\nat the expense of the physical powers.\r\n\r\nMENTAL CULTURE DURING CHILDHOOD. One of the greatest mistakes which\r\npeople make in the management of their children, is to overtask their\r\nmental faculties. Although it is exceedingly gratifying to see children\r\nacquire knowledge, and manifest an understanding far beyond their years,\r\nthis gratification is often purchased too dearly, for precocious\r\nchildren are apt to die young. The tissue of the brain and nerves of\r\nchildren is very delicate; they have not yet acquired the powers of\r\nendurance which older persons possess. The greater portion of the\r\nnutriment assimilated, is required for growth and organic development,\r\nand they can ill afford its expenditure for mental manifestations. They\r\nreceive impressions easier and learn much more readily than in after\r\nlife, but it is at the expense of the physical organization. Their\r\nmental faculties continue to be developed by the expenditure of brain\r\nnutriment, while physical growth and the powers of endurance are\r\narrested. It is much better to give physical development the precedence\r\nin order that the mental organism may be well supported and its\r\noperations carried into effect; for it must be apparent to all that an\r\nordinary intellect in a healthy body, is capable of accomplishing\r\ninfinitely more than a strong mind in a _weak_ body. Regularity should\r\nbe observed in exercising the mental functions. For this reason a fixed\r\norder in the pursuit of any literary occupation is very essential. The\r\npursuit of the most abstruse studies will thus become habitual and\r\ncomparatively easy, a consequence of systematic application. Mental\r\nlabor should always cease when the train of thought becomes confused,\r\nand there is the slightest sensation of depression. All distracting\r\ninfluences should be absent from the mind, in order to facilitate\r\nintense study, for the intellect cannot attend perfectly to two subjects\r\nat the same time. Painful sensations always have a tendency to paralyze\r\nmental exertion. Great care should be taken that the head is not\r\nsubjected to injury of any kind, as it is almost invariably accompanied\r\nby some nervous derangement. Exposure to extreme heat should be\r\ncarefully avoided. An attack of sun-stroke although it may not be\r\nimmediately fatal, may occasion tumors in the brain, or some organic\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\n\r\nSLEEP.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor all animated beings sleep is an imperious necessity, as\r\nindispensable as food. The welfare of man requires alternate periods of\r\nactivity and repose. It is a well-established physiological fact, that\r\nduring the wakeful hours the vital energies are being expended, the\r\npowers of life diminished, and, if wakefulness is continued beyond a\r\ncertain limit, the system becomes enfeebled and death is the result.\r\nDuring sleep there is a temporary cessation of vital expenditures, and a\r\nrecuperation of all the forces. Under the influence of sleep \"the blood\r\nis refreshed, the brain recruited, physical sufferings are extinguished,\r\nmental troubles are removed, the organism is relieved, and hope returns\r\nto the heart.\"\r\n\r\nThe severest punishment which can be inflicted upon a person, is to\r\nentirely deprive him of sleep. In China, a few years since, three\r\ncriminals were sentenced to be kept awake until they should die. To do\r\nthis it was necessary to keep a guard over them. The sentinels were\r\narmed with sharp, pointed instruments, with which to goad the victims\r\nand thus prevent them from sleeping. Life soon became a burden, and,\r\nalthough they were well fed during the time, death occurred sooner than\r\nit would have done had starvation been the punishment.\r\n\r\nSLEEPING ROOMS. The sleeping room should be large and well ventilated,\r\nand the air kept moderately cool. The necessity for a fire may be\r\ndetermined by the health of the occupant. Besides maintaining a proper\r\ntemperature in the room, a little fire is useful, especially if in a\r\ngrate, for the purpose of securing good ventilation. The windows should\r\nnot be so arranged as to allow a draught upon the body during the night,\r\nbut yet so adjusted that the inmate may obtain plenty of fresh air.\r\n\r\nTHE BED should not be too soft, but rather hard. Feathers give off\r\nanimal emanations of an injurious character, and impart a feeling of\r\nlassitude and debility to those sleeping on them. No more coverings\r\nshould be used than are actually necessary for the comfort of the\r\nindividual. Cotton sheets are warmer than linen, and answer equally as\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nSLEEPING ALONE. Certain effluvia are thrown off from our persons, and\r\nwhen two individuals sleep together each inhales from the other more or\r\nless of these emanations. There is little doubt that _consumption_, and\r\nmany other diseases, not usually considered contagious, are sometimes\r\ncommunicated in this manner. When it is not practicable for individuals\r\nto occupy separate beds, the persons sleeping together should be of\r\nabout the same age, and in good health. Numerous cases have occurred in\r\nwhich healthy, robust children have gradually declined and died within a\r\nfew months, from the evil effects of sleeping with old people. Again,\r\nthose in feeble health have been greatly benefited, and even restored,\r\nby sleeping with others who were young and healthy.\r\n\r\nTIME FOR SLEEP. _Night_ is the proper time for sleep. When day is\r\nsubstituted for night, the sleep obtained does not fully restore the\r\nexhausted energies of the system. Nature does not allow her laws to be\r\nbroken with impunity.\r\n\r\nChildren require more sleep than old persons. They are sometimes\r\nstupefied with \"soothing syrups,\" and preparations of opium, in order to\r\nget them temporarily out of the way. Such narcotics are very injurious\r\nand dangerous. We have known a young child to be killed by a _single\r\ndrop_ of laudanum. This practice, therefore, cannot be too emphatically\r\ncondemned.\r\n\r\nHOW TO PUT CHILDREN TO BED. The following characteristic lines are from\r\nthe pen of Fanny Fern, and contain such good advice that we cannot\r\nrefrain from quoting them: \"Not with a reproof for any of the day's sins\r\nof omission or commission. Take any other time than bed-time for that.\r\nIf you ever heard a little creature sighing or sobbing in its sleep, you\r\ncould never do this. Seal their closing eyelids with a kiss and a\r\nblessing. The time will come, all too soon, when they will lay their\r\nheads upon their pillows lacking both. Let them at least have this sweet\r\nmemory of happy childhood, of which no future sorrow or trouble can rob\r\nthem. Give them their rosy youth. Nor need this involve wild license.\r\nThe judicious parent will not so mistake my meaning. If you ever met the\r\nman or the woman, whose eyes have suddenly filled when a little child\r\nhas crept trustingly to its mother's breast, you may have seen one in\r\nwhose childhood's home 'dignity' and 'severity' stood where love and\r\npity should have been. Too much indulgence has ruined thousands of\r\nchildren; too much love not one.\"\r\n\r\nPOSITION IN SLEEP. The proper position in sleep is upon the right side.\r\nThe orifice leading from the stomach to the bowels being on this side,\r\nthis position favors the passage of the contents into the duodenum.\r\nLying on the back is injurious, since by so doing the spine becomes\r\nheated, especially if the person sleeps on feathers, the circulation is\r\nobstructed and local congestions are encouraged. The face should never\r\nbe covered during sleep, since it necessitates the breathing of the same\r\nair over again, together with the emanations from the body.\r\n\r\nTHE AMOUNT OF SLEEP. The amount of sleep required varies with the age,\r\nhabits, condition, and peculiarities of the individual. No definite rule\r\ncan be given for the guidance of all. The average amount required,\r\nhowever, is eight or nine hours out of the twenty-four. Some persons\r\nneed more than this, while others can do with less. Since both body and\r\nmind are recuperated by sleep, the more they are exhausted the more\r\nsleep is required. A person employed at mental labor should have more\r\nthan one who is merely expending muscular strength. Six hours of\r\nunbroken sleep do more to refresh and revive than ten when frequently\r\ninterrupted. If it is too prolonged it weakens and stupefies both body\r\nand mind. If an insufficient amount is taken the flagging energies are\r\nnot restored. Persons who eat much, or use stimulants generally require\r\nmore than others. To sleep regularity is desirable. If a person goes to\r\nbed at a certain hour for several nights in succession, it will soon\r\nbecome a habit. The same holds true with regard to rising. If children\r\nare put to sleep at a stated hour for several days in succession, it\r\nwill soon become a habit with them.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLEANLINESS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Cleanliness is next to godliness,\" and is essential to the health and\r\nvigor of the system. Its importance cannot be overestimated, and it\r\nshould be inculcated early on the minds of the young. \"Even from the\r\nbody's purity, the mind receives a secret sympathetic aid.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the functions of the skin, with its myriads of minute\r\nglands, innumerable little tubes, employed in removing the worn-out,\r\nuseless matter from the system, we cannot fail to appreciate the utility\r\nof frequent bathing with soap and water. Unless these excretions are\r\nremoved, the glands become obstructed, their functions are arrested, and\r\nunpleasant odors arise. Many persons think because they daily bathe the\r\nface, neck, and hands, dress the hair becomingly and remove the dirt\r\nfrom their clothing that the height of cleanliness has been reached.\r\nFrom a hygienic point of view, bathing the _entire_ body is of much\r\ngreater importance.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the necessity for cleanliness of the body, we\r\noccasionally meet with persons who, although particular about their\r\npersonal appearance, permit their bodies to be for weeks and even months\r\nwithout a bath. Such neglect should never exceed one week. Plenty of\r\nsunlight and at least one or two general baths every week are essential\r\nto perfect health. Cleanliness is necessary to health, beauty,\r\nattractiveness, and a cheerful disposition.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nHYGIENE OF THE REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe structure and functions of organized bodies are subject to continual\r\nalteration. The changes of nutrition and growth, which are constantly\r\ntaking place in the tissues render them at the same time the seat of\r\nrepair and waste, of renovation and decomposition, of life and death.\r\nThe plant germinates and blossoms, then withers and decays; animal life,\r\nin like manner, comes into being, grows to maturity, fades, and dies. It\r\nis, therefore, essential to the perpetuation of life, that new organisms\r\nbe provided to take the place of those which are passing out of\r\nexistence. There is no physiological process which presents more\r\ninteresting phenomena than that of reproduction, which includes the\r\nformation, as well as the development of new beings.\r\n\r\nSince self-preservation is Nature's first law, the desire for food is a\r\nmost powerful instinct in all living animals. Not inferior to this law\r\nis that for the perpetuation of the race; and for this purpose,\r\nthroughout the animal and vegetable kingdoms, we find the Biblical\r\nstatement literally illustrated: \"Male and female created He them.\"\r\n\r\nHealth is the gauge by which the prosperity of a people may be measured.\r\nWere we to trace the history of nations,--their rise and fall,--we would\r\nfind that much of the barbarism and crime, degradation and vice, as well\r\nas their decline and final extinction, was due to licentiousness and\r\nsexual excesses. Since there is an intimate relation between mind and\r\nbody, when the body is enfeebled the mind becomes enervated. Morbid\r\nconditions of the body prevent the highest mental development, and, on\r\nthe other hand, when the mind is debilitated, general depravity,\r\nphysical as well as mental, is the result. The highest development of\r\nthe body results from the equal and harmonious cultivation of all the\r\nmental powers. The perfect development and health of the physical organs\r\nis therefore essential to the happiness of mankind. But, before health\r\ncan be insured the nature and general functions of the physical system\r\nmust be understood. This being done, the question naturally arises: _How\r\ncan health be best maintained and longevity secured?_\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF FOOD. We have previously noticed the effects which food,\r\nexercise, and other hygienic agencies, have upon digestion, circulation,\r\nand respiration; and we find that they exert a not less potent influence\r\nupon the health of the generative organs. Excessive stimulation excites\r\nthe sexual passions. For this reason, children should not be\r\nimmoderately indulged in highly seasoned foods. Those persons who have\r\ngreat muscular vigor are endowed with violent passions, and unless\r\nrestrained by moral considerations, are very likely to be overcome by\r\ntheir animal propensities.\r\n\r\n_Alcoholic stimulants_ have a debasing influence upon the whole system,\r\nand especially upon the sexual organs; they excite the animal and debase\r\nthe moral nature; they exhaust the vitality, and, after the excitement,\r\nwhich they temporarily induce, has passed away, the body is left in a\r\nprostrated condition.\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL LABOR MODIFIES THE PASSIONS. Labor consumes the surplus\r\nvitality which a person may possess, and no better protective can be\r\nfound against the gratification of the passions, unless it be high moral\r\ntraining, than daily toil extended to such a degree as to produce\r\nfatigue. Labor determines the blood to the surface and to other parts of\r\nthe body, and prevents excitement and congestion of the sexual centers.\r\nIf, by education or association, the passions of children be excited,\r\nthey will be increased. If, on the contrary, they be taught to avoid\r\nthese social or solitary evils, they will be abated. Let them be\r\neducated to work and the intellectual faculties will assert their sway,\r\nthe moral powers will be strengthened, and the body better developed,\r\nfor purity of mind is the result of the perfect development of man.\r\n\r\nINFLUENCES OF CLIMATE. Individuals possess distinguishing peculiarities\r\ncharacteristic of the nation to which they belong. Climate exerts a\r\npowerful influence upon mankind. In tropical regions the inhabitants are\r\nenervated, effeminate, and sensual. The rich live in luxury and ease,\r\nvice is unrestrained and license unbridled. When the animal propensities\r\nare allowed to predominate, the mental faculties are kept in subjection.\r\nHence races that inhabit those latitudes rarely produce scholars or\r\nphilosophers. A warm climate hastens the development of the reproductive\r\norgans. Men and women become mature at a much earlier age in those\r\nregions, than in countries where the temperature is lower. In like\r\nmanner there is a tendency to premature enfeeblement, for the earlier\r\nthe system matures, the sooner it deteriorates.\r\n\r\nMAN IS A SOCIAL BEING. History demonstrates that when man is deprived of\r\nthe society of women, he becomes reckless, vicious, depraved, and even\r\nbarbarous in his habits, thus illustrating the maxim: \"It is not good\r\nfor man to be alone.\" Social intercourse promotes mental and physical\r\ndevelopment. The development of the individual implies the unfolding of\r\nevery power, both physical and mental. Nothing so regulates and\r\nrestrains passion as a healthy condition of the organs through which it\r\nfinds expression. And every organ of the body is powerful in proportion\r\nto its soundness. The propensities play a prominent part in the\r\neducation of the child. When properly disciplined and held in\r\nsubordination to the higher faculties, they constitute an important\r\nfactor in the economy of man. Boys are more liable to be morbidly\r\nexcited when secluded from the society of girls, and vice versa. Again,\r\nwhen the sexes are accustomed to associate, the passions are not apt to\r\nbe aroused, because of the natural antagonistic constitutional elements.\r\nThe influence of the one refines, and ennobles the other. Let children\r\nbe taught to understand their natures, and knowing them, they will learn\r\nself-government. \"As man rises in education and moral feeling he\r\nproportionately rises in the power of self-restraint; and consequently\r\nas he becomes deprived of this wholesome law of discipline he sinks into\r\nself-indulgence and the brutality of savage life.\r\n\r\nThe passions may be aroused by the language, appearance or dress of the\r\nopposite sex. A word spoken without any impure intent is often construed\r\nin a very different sense by one whose passions color the thought, and\r\nis made to convey an impression entirely unlike that which was intended\r\nby the speaker. Also, the dress may be of such a character as to excite\r\nthe sexual passion. The manner in which the apparel is worn is often so\r\nconspicuous as to become bawdy, thereby appealing to the libidinous\r\ndesires, rather than awakening an admiration for the mental qualities.\r\n\r\nOBSCENE LITERATURE. Literature is a powerful agent either for good or\r\nevil. If we would improve the morals, _choice_ literature must be\r\nselected, whether it be that which realizes the ideal, or idealizes the\r\nreal. Obscene literature, or books written for the express purpose of\r\nexciting or intensifying sexual desires in the young, goads to an\r\nillicit gratification of the passions, and ruins the moral and physical\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nIt not unfrequently happens that a child is born with a vigorous, mental\r\norganism which promises a brilliant future, but manhood finds him\r\nincompetent, debilitated, and totally incapacitated for mental or manual\r\nlabor. This may be the result of youthful indiscretion, ignorantly\r\ncommitted, but not unfrequently it is the effect of a pernicious\r\nliterature which inflames the imagination, tramples upon reason, and\r\ndescribes to the youth a realm where the passions are the ruling\r\ndeities.\r\n\r\nMany persons are born into the world with disordered organizations for\r\nwhich they are not themselves responsible. Such individuals are entitled\r\nto the sympathy of humanity. Dyspepsia, scrofula, consumption, and a\r\nthousand ills to which mankind is heir, are inherited from parents, the\r\nresults of ill-assorted marriages. Intoxicated parents often produce\r\noffspring utterly demented. Children of healthy parents, with good\r\nconstitutions, are usually healthy and intelligent. There are marked\r\nvarieties of character in children of the same parents. One manifests\r\ngreat precocity, another is below the average in mental attainments; one\r\nis amiable, another irritable in disposition; indeed, there are often as\r\ngreat differences between children of the same, as of different\r\nfamilies. This is due to the physical and mental conditions of the\r\nparents, more especially the mother, not only at the time of the\r\nimpregnation but also during the period intervening between conception\r\nand the birth of the offspring. The ancients regarded courage as the\r\nprincipal virtue. By us, purity is so estimated. Moral purity is an\r\nessential requisite to the growth and perfection of the character.\r\n\r\nSELF-ABUSE. Untold miseries arise from the pollution of the body.\r\nSelf-pollution, or onanism, is one of the most prolific sources of evil,\r\nsince it leads both to the degradation of body and mind. It is practiced\r\nmore or less by members of both sexes, and the habit once established,\r\nis overcome with the greatest difficulty. It is the source of numerous\r\ndiseases which derange the functional activity of the organs involved,\r\nand eventually impair the constitution. This vicious habit is often\r\npracticed by those who are ignorant of its dangerous results. Statistics\r\nshow that insanity is frequently caused by masturbation.\r\n\r\nImmoderate indulgence in any practice is deleterious to the individual.\r\nEmphatically true is this with regard to sexual excesses. Not\r\nunfrequently does the marriage rite \"cover a multitude of sins.\" The\r\nabuse of the conjugal relation produces the most serious results to both\r\nparties, and is a prolific source of some of the gravest forms of\r\ndisease. Prostatorrhea, spermatorrhea, impotency, hypochondria, and\r\ngeneral debility of the generative organs, arise from sexual excesses.\r\n\r\nThe health of the reproductive organs can only be maintained by leading\r\na _temperate_ life. The food should be nourishing but not stimulating.\r\nLascivious thoughts should be banished from the mind, and a taste\r\ncultivated for that literature which is elevating in its nature, and the\r\nassociations should be refining and ennobling. Let these conditions and\r\nthe rules of hygiene, be observed, and virtue will reward her subjects\r\nwith a fine physique and a noble character.\r\n\r\nWoman, from the nature of her organization, has less strength and\r\nendurance than man. Much, however, of the suffering and misery which she\r\nexperiences arises from insufficient attention to the sexual organs. The\r\nmenstrual function is generally established between the ages of twelve\r\nand fourteen. For want of proper instruction, many a girl through\r\nignorance HAS caused derangements which have enfeebled her womanhood or\r\nterminated her life. At this critical period the mother cannot be too\r\nconsiderate of her daughter's health. Preceding the first appearance of\r\nthe menses, girls usually feel an aching in the back, pains in the\r\nlimbs, chilliness, and general languor. The establishment of this\r\nfunction relieves these symptoms. Every precaution should be taken\r\nduring the period to keep the feet dry and warm, to freely maintain a\r\ngeneral circulation of the blood, to avoid exertion, and to refrain from\r\nstanding or walking too much. Menstrual derangements should never be\r\nneglected, for they predispose to affections of the brain, liver, heart,\r\nand stomach, induce consumption and frequently end in death. Young women\r\nshould, therefore, properly protect themselves, and avoid extremes of\r\nheat and cold.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nPRACTICAL SUMMARY OF HYGIENE.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The first step which should be taken for the prevention of disease,\r\nis to make provision for the health of the unborn child. Greater care\r\nshould be exercised with women who are in a way to become mothers. Those\r\nwho are surrounded by all the luxuries which health can bestow, indulge\r\ntoo much in rich food, and take too little exercise; while the poor get\r\ntoo little nourishment, and work too hard and too long. A woman in this\r\ncondition should avoid over-exertion, and all scenes which excite the\r\npassions or powerful emotions. She should take moderate exercise in the\r\nopen air; eat moderately of wholesome food, and of meat not oftener than\r\ntwice a day; take tea or coffee in limited quantities, and avoid the use\r\nof all alcoholic liquors; she should go to bed early and take not less\r\nthan nine hours sleep; her clothing should be loose, light in weight,\r\nand warm. She should take every precaution against exposure to\r\ncontagious or infectious diseases.\r\n\r\n2. There is no better method for preventing the spread of contagious\r\ndiseases than perfect isolation of the infected, and thorough\r\ndisinfection of all articles of clothing or bedding which have been in\r\ncontact with the infected. Many persons erroneously believe that every\r\nchild must necessarily have the measles, and other contagious diseases,\r\nand they, therefore, take no precautions against the exposure of their\r\nchildren. The liability to infection diminishes as age advances, and\r\nthose individuals are, as a rule, the strongest and best developed who\r\nhave never suffered from any of the contagious diseases. Although,\r\nvaccination is the great safeguard against-pox, yet it should never\r\nprevent the immediate isolation of those who are suffering from this\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\n3. To avoid the injurious effects of impure air, the following rules,\r\nshould be carefully observed. The admission of air which contains\r\nanything that emits an unpleasant odor into closed rooms should be\r\navoided. The temperature of every apartment should be kept as near 70°\r\nFahr. as possible, and the air should not be overcharged with watery\r\nvapor. Provisions should be made for the free admission into and escape\r\nof air from the room at all times. When an apartment is not in use, it\r\nshould be thoroughly ventilated by opening the windows. Those who are\r\ncompelled to remain in an atmosphere tilled with dust, should wear a\r\ncotton-wool respirator.\r\n\r\n4. To insure a healthy condition of the body, the diet of man ought to\r\nbe varied, and all excesses should be avoided. The total amount of solid\r\nfood taken in the twenty-four hours should not exceed two and a half\r\npounds, and not more than one-third of this quantity should consist of\r\nanimal food. Many persons do not require more than one pound and a half\r\nof mixed food. To avoid parasitic diseases, meat should not be eaten\r\nrare, especially pork. The amount of drink taken should not be more than\r\nthree pints in twenty-four hours. The excessive use of tea and coffee\r\nshould be avoided. Pickles, boiled cabbage, and other indigestible\r\narticles should never be eaten.\r\n\r\n5. To avoid the evil effects of alcoholic liquors, perfect abstinence is\r\nthe only safe course to pursue. Although one may use spirituous liquors\r\nin moderation for a long period of time and possibly remain healthy, yet\r\nsuch an indulgence is unnecessary and exceedingly dangerous. A person\r\nwho abstains entirely from their use is safe from their pernicious\r\ninfluence; a person who indulges ever so moderately is in danger; a\r\nperson who relies on such stimulants for support in the hour of need is\r\nlost.\r\n\r\n6. While the use of tobacco is less pernicious than alcohol in its\r\neffects, et it exerts a profound disturbing influence upon the nervous\r\nsystem, and gives rise to various functional and organic diseases. This\r\nis the verdict of those who have given the subject the most study, and\r\nwho have had the best opportunities for extensive observation. Suddenly\r\nfatal results have followed excesses in the use of tobacco. Therefore,\r\nthe habit should be avoided, or if already acquired, it should be\r\nimmediately abandoned.\r\n\r\n7. The clothing should be light and porous, adapted in warmth to the\r\nseason. It is especially important that persons in advanced life should\r\nbe well protected against vicissitudes of heat and cold. Exposure is the\r\ncause of almost all those inflammatory diseases which occur during\r\nwinter, and take off the feeble and the aged. The under-garments should\r\nbe kept scrupulously clean by frequent changes. Corsets or bands which\r\nimpede the flow of blood, compress the organs of the chest or abdomen,\r\nor restrict the movements of the body, are very injurious, and should\r\nnot be worn. Articles of dress which are colored with irritating\r\ndye-stuffs, should be carefully avoided.\r\n\r\n8. It matters not how varied a person's vocation may be, change,\r\nrecreation, and rest are required. It is an error to suppose that more\r\nwork can be done by omitting these. No single occupation which requires\r\nspecial mental or physical work, should be followed for more than eight\r\nhours out of the twenty-four. The physical organism is not constructed\r\nto run its full cycle of years and labor under a heavier burden than\r\nthis. Physical and mental exercise is conducive to health and longevity,\r\nif not carried too far. It is erroneous to suppose that excessive\r\nphysical exertion promotes health. Man was never intended to be a\r\nrunning or a jumping machine. In mental work, variety should be\r\nintroduced. New work calls into play fresh portions of the brain, and\r\nsecures repose for those parts which have become exhausted. Idleness\r\nshould be avoided by all. Men should never retire from business as long\r\nas they enjoy a fair degree of health. Idleness and inactivity are\r\nopposed to nature.\r\n\r\n9. The average length of time which a person ought to sleep is eight\r\nhours out of the twenty-four, and, as a rule, those who take this amount\r\nenjoy the best health. The most favorable time for sleep is between the\r\nhours of 10 P.M. and 6 A.M. All excitement, the use of stimulants, and\r\nexcessive fatigue tend to prevent sleep. Sleeping rooms should be well\r\nventilated, and the air maintained at a equable temperature of as near\r\n60° Fahr. as possible. An inability to sleep at the proper time, or a\r\nregular inclination to sleep at other than the natural hours for it, is\r\na certain indication of errors of habit, or of nervous derangement.\r\n\r\n10. Prominent among all other measures for the maintenance of Health, is\r\npersonal cleanliness. Activity in the functions of the skin is essential\r\nto perfect health, and this can only be secured by thoroughly bathing\r\nthe entire body. Strictly, a person should bathe once every twenty-four\r\nor forty-eight hours. The body should be habituated to contact with cold\r\nwater at all season of the year, so that warm water may not become a\r\nnecessity. The simplest and most convenient bath, is the ordinary\r\nsponge-bath. An occasional hot-air, or Turkish bath, exerts a very\r\nbeneficial influence. It cleans out the pores of the skin and increases\r\nits activity.\r\n\r\n11. The emotions and the passions exert a powerful influence over the\r\nphysical organism. It is important, therefore, that they be held under\r\nrestraint by the reasoning faculties. This rule applies equally to joy,\r\nfear, and grief; to avarice, anger, and hatred; and, above all, to the\r\nsexual passion. They are a prolific source of disease of the nervous\r\nsystem, and have caused the dethronement of some of the most gifted\r\nintellects.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III.\r\n\r\nRATIONAL MEDICINE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE PROGRESS OF MEDICINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the last half century a great change has taken place in the\r\ntreatment of disease. Medicine has advanced with rapid strides, from the\r\nnarrow limits of mere empiricism, to the broader realm of rationalism,\r\nuntil to day it comprehends all the elements of an art and a science.\r\nScientific researches and investigations have added many valuable truths\r\nto the general fund of medical learning, but much more has been effected\r\nby observation and empirical discovery. It is of little or no interest\r\nto the invalid to know whether the prescribed remedy is organic or\r\ninorganic, simple, compound, or complex. In his anxiety and distress of\r\nbody, he seeks solely for relief, without regard to the character of the\r\nremedial agents employed. But this indifference on the part of the\r\npatient does not obviate the necessity for a thorough, scientific\r\neducation on the part of the practitioner. Notwithstanding all the laws\r\nenacted to raise the standard of medicine, and thus protect the public\r\nfrom quackery, there yet exists a disposition among many to cling to all\r\nthat savors of the miraculous, or supernatural. To insure the future\r\nadvancement of the healing art, physicians must instruct mankind in\r\nPhysiology, Hygiene, and Medicine. When the people understand the nature\r\nof diseases, their causes, methods of prevention and cure, they will not\r\nbe easily deceived, and practitioners will be obliged to qualify\r\nthemselves better for their labors. The practice of medicine is every\r\nyear becoming more successful. New and improved methods of treating\r\ndisease are being discovered and developed, and the conscientious\r\nphysician will avail himself of _all_ the means, by a knowledge of which\r\nhe may benefit his fellow-men. The medical profession is divided into\r\nthree principal schools, or sects.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ALLOPATHIC, REGULAR, OR OLD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the oldest existing branch of the profession. To it is due the\r\ncredit of collecting and arranging the facts and discoveries which form\r\nthe foundation of the healing art. It has done, and is doing, much to\r\nplace the science of medicine on a firm basis. To the text-books of this\r\nschool, every student who would qualify himself for medical practice\r\nmust resort, to gain that knowledge upon which depends his future\r\nsuccess. The early practice of this branch of the profession was\r\nnecessarily crude and empirical. Conservative in its character, it has\r\never been slow to recognize new theories and methods of practice, and\r\nhas failed to adopt them until they have been incontrovertibly\r\nestablished. This conservatism was manifested in the opposition to\r\nHarvey when he propounded the theory of the circulation of the blood,\r\nand to Jenner when he discovered and demonstrated the beneficial effects\r\nof vaccination. Thus has it ever defended its established opinions\r\nagainst innovation; yet out of this very conservatism has grown much\r\nreal good, for, although it has wasted no time or energy in the\r\ninvestigation of theories, yet it has accepted them when established. In\r\nthis manner it has added to its fund of knowledge only those truths\r\nwhich are of real and intrinsic value.\r\n\r\nThe history of medicine may be divided into three eras. In the first,\r\nthe practice of medicine was merely empiricism. Ignorant priests or\r\nastrologers administered drugs, concerning the properties of which they\r\nhad no knowledge, to appease the wrath of mythological deities. In the\r\nsecond or heroic era, the lancet, mercury, antimony, opium, and the\r\nblister were employed indiscriminately as the _sine qua non_ of medical\r\npractice. The present, with all its scientific knowledge of the human\r\nstructure and functions, and its vast resources for remedying disease\r\nmay be aptly termed the liberal era of medicine. The allopathic differs\r\nfrom the other schools, mainly in the application of remedies. In its\r\nranks are found men, indefatigable in their labors, delving deep into\r\nthe mysteries of nature, and who, for their scientific attainments and\r\nhumane principles are justly considered ornaments to society and to\r\ntheir profession.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOMOEOPATHY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough this school is of comparatively recent origin, yet it has\r\ngained a powerful hold upon the public favor, and numbers among its\r\npatrons very many intelligent citizens. This fact alone would seem to\r\nindicate that it possesses some merit. The homeopathic differs from the\r\nallopathic school principally in its _\"law of cure,\"_ which, according\r\nto Hahnemann, its founder, was the doctrine of _\"similia similibus\r\ncurantur\"_ or \"like cures like.\" Its method of treatment is founded upon\r\nthe assumption that if a drug be given to a healthy person, symptoms\r\nwill occur which, if transpiring in disease, would be mitigated by the\r\nsame drug. While it may be exceedingly difficult for a member of another\r\nschool to accept this doctrine and comprehend the method founded upon\r\nit, yet no one can deny that it contains some elements of truth.\r\n\r\nImbued with the spirit of progress, many of its most intelligent and\r\nsuccessful practitioners have resorted to the use of appreciable\r\nquantities of medicine. This school associates hydropathy with its\r\npractice, and usually inculcates rigid dietetic and hygienic\r\nregulations. Many homoeopathic remedies are thoroughly triturated with\r\nsugar of milk, which renders them more palatable and efficacious.\r\nWhether we attribute their cures to the infinitesimal doses which many\r\nhomoeopathists employ, to their \"law of cure,\" to good nursing, or to\r\nthe power of nature, it is nevertheless true that their practice is\r\nmeasurably successful. No doubt the homoeopathic practice has modified\r\nthat of the other schools, by proving that diseases may be alleviated by\r\nsmaller quantities of medicine than were formerly employed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ECLECTIC SCHOOL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis school, founded by Wooster Beach, instituted the most strenuous\r\nopposition to the employment of mercury, antimony, the blister, and the\r\nlancet. The members of this new school proclaimed that the action of\r\nheroic and noxious medicines was opposed to the operation of the vital\r\nforces, and proposed to substitute in their place safer and more\r\nefficacious agents, derived exclusively from the vegetable kingdom. The\r\neclectics have investigated the properties of indigenous plants and have\r\ndiscovered many valuable remedies, which a kind and bounteous nature has\r\nso generously supplied for the healing of her children. Marked success\r\nattended the employment of these agents. In 1852, a committee on\r\n\"Indigenous Medical Botany,\" appointed by the \"American Medical\r\nAssociation,\" acknowledged that the practitioners of the regular school\r\nhad been extremely ignorant of the medical virtues of plants, even of\r\nthose of their own neighborhoods. The employment of podophyllin and\r\nleptandrin as substitutes for mercurials has been so successful that\r\nthey are now used by practitioners of all schools. Although claiming to\r\nhave been founded upon liberal principles, it may be questioned whether\r\nits adherents have not been quite as exclusive and dogmatic as those\r\nwhom they have opposed. It cannot be denied, however, that the eclectics\r\nhave added many important remedies to the Materia Medica. Their writings\r\nare important and useful contributions to the physician's library.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIBERAL AND INDEPENDENT PHYSICIAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter this brief review of the various medical sects, the reader may be\r\ncurious to learn to what sect the physicians of the Invalids' Hotel and\r\nSurgical Institute belong. Among them are to be found graduates from the\r\ncolleges of all the different schools. They are not restricted by the\r\ntenets of any one sect, but claim the right and privilege, nay, consider\r\nit a duty, to select from all, such remedies as careful investigation,\r\nscientific research, and an extensive experience, have proved valuable.\r\nThey resort to any and every agent which has been proved efficacious,\r\nwhether it be vegetable or mineral.\r\n\r\nAnd here arises a distinction between _sanative_ remedial agents and\r\nthose which are _noxious_. Many practitioners deplore the use of\r\npoisons, and advocate innocuous medicines which produce only curative\r\nresults. We agree with them in one proposition, namely, that improper\r\nmedicines not only poison, but frequently utterly destroy the health and\r\nbody of the patient. Every physician should keep steadily in view the\r\nfinal effects, as well as present relief, and never employ any agent\r\nwithout regard to its ulterior consequences. However, an agent which is\r\nnoxious in _health_, may prove a valuable remedy in _disease_. When\r\nmorbid changes have taken place in the blood and tissues, when a general\r\ndiseased condition of the bodily organs has occurred, then an agent,\r\nwhich is poisonous in health, may prove curative. For instance it is\r\nadmitted that alcohol is a poison; that it prevents healthful\r\nassimilation, solidifies pepsin, begets a morbid appetite; that it\r\nproduces intoxication, and that its habitual use destroys the body. It\r\nis, therefore, neither a hygienic nor a sanative agent, but strictly a\r\nnoxious one; yet, its very distinct antiseptic properties render it\r\nvaluable for remedial purposes, since these qualities promptly arrest\r\nthat fatal form of decomposition of the animal fluids which is\r\noccasioned by snake-venom, which produces its deadly effects in the same\r\nmanner as a drop of yeast ferments the largest mash. Alcohol checks this\r\npoisonous and deadly process and neutralizes its effects. Thus, alcohol,\r\nalthough a noxious agent, possesses a special curative influence in a\r\nmorbid state of the human system; but its general remedial effects do\r\nnot entitle it to the rank of a hygienic agent. We believe that medicine\r\nis undergoing a gradual change from the darkness of the past, with its\r\nignorance, superstition, and barbarism, to the light of a glorious\r\nfuture. At each successive step in the path of progress, medicine\r\napproaches one degree nearer the realm of an exact science. The common\r\nobject of the practitioners of all medical schools is the alleviation of\r\nhuman suffering. The only difference between the schools is in the\r\nremedies employed, the size of dose administered, and the results\r\nattained. These are insufficient grounds for bitter sectarianism. We are\r\nall fellow laborers in the same field. Before us lies a boundless\r\nexpanse for exploration. There are new conditions of disease to be\r\nlearned, new remedies to be discovered, and new properties of old ones\r\nto be examined.\r\n\r\nWe do not deplore the fact, that there are different schools in\r\nmedicine, for this science has not reached perfection, and they tend to\r\nstimulate investigation. The remarks of Herbert Spencer on the\r\n\"Multiplication of Schemes of Juvenile Culture,\" may be pertinently\r\napplied to the different schools in medicine with increased force. He\r\nsays: \"It is clear that dissent in education results in facilitating\r\ninquiry by the division in labor. Were we in possession of the true\r\nmethod, divergence from it would, of course, be prejudicial; but the\r\ntrue method having to be found, the efforts of numerous independent\r\nseekers carrying out their researches in different directions,\r\nconstitute a better agency for finding it than any that could be\r\ndevised. Each of them struck by some new thought which probably contains\r\nmore or less of basis in facts--each of them zealous on behalf of his\r\nplan, fertile in expedients to test its correctness, and untiring in its\r\nefforts to make known its success--each of them merciless in its\r\ncriticism on the rest--there cannot fail, by composition of forces, to\r\nbe a gradual approximation of all towards the right course. Whatever\r\nportion of the normal method any one of them has discovered, must, by\r\nthe constant exhibition of its results, force itself into adoption;\r\nwhatever wrong practices he has joined with it must, by repeated\r\nexperiment and failure, be exploded. And by this aggregation of truths\r\nand elimination of errors, there must eventually be developed a correct\r\nand complete body of doctrine. Of the three phases through which human\r\nopinion passes--the unanimity of the ignorant, the disagreement of the\r\ninquiring, and the unanimity of the wise--it is manifest that the second\r\nis the parent of the third.\"\r\n\r\nWe believe the time is coming when those maladies which are now\r\nconsidered fatal will be readily cured--when disease will be disarmed of\r\nits terrors. To be successful, a physician must be independent, free\r\nfrom all bigotry, having no narrow prejudice against his fellow-men,\r\nliberal, accepting new truths from whatever source they come, free from\r\nrestrictions of societies, and an earnest laborer in the interests of\r\nthe Great Physician.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nREMEDIES FOR DISEASE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be our aim, throughout this book, to prescribe such remedies as\r\nare within the easy reach of all, and which may be safely employed. Many\r\nof those of the vegetable class are indigenous to this country, and may\r\nbe procured in their strength and purity, at the proper season, by those\r\nresiding in the localities where they grow, while all others advised may\r\nbe obtained at any good drug-store. We shall endeavor to recommend such\r\nas can be procured and prepared with the least trouble and expense to\r\nthe patient, when it is believed that they will be equally as\r\nefficacious as more expensive medicines.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPRIETARY MEDICINES.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving the invalid's best interests in view, it will often happen that\r\nwe cannot prescribe better or cheaper remedies nor those which are more\r\neffective or easily obtained, than some of our standard preparations,\r\nwhich are sold by all druggists. We are aware that there is a popular,\r\nand not altogether unfounded prejudice against \"patent medicines,\" owing\r\nto the small amount of merit which many of them possess. The term\r\n\"Patent Medicine\" does not apply to Dr. Pierce's remedies, as no patent\r\nhas ever been asked or obtained for them, nor have they been urged upon\r\nthe public as \"cure alls.\" They are simply favorite prescriptions,\r\nwhich, in a very extensive practice, have proved their superior remedial\r\nvirtues in the cure of the diseases for which they are recommended.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of Hippocrates down to the present day, physicians have\r\nclassified diseases according to their causes, character or symptoms. It\r\nhas been proved that diseases apparently different may often be cured by\r\nthe same remedy. The reason for this singular fact is obvious. A single\r\nremedy may possess a variety of properties. Quinine, among other\r\nproperties has a tonic which suggests its use in cases of debility; an\r\nantiperiodic, which renders it efficient in ague; and an anti-febrile\r\nproperty, which renders it efficacious in cases of fever. The result\r\nproduced varies with the quantity given, the time of its administration,\r\nand the circumstances under which it is employed. Every practicing\r\nphysician has his favorite remedies, which he oftenest recommends or\r\nuses, because he has the greatest confidence in their virtues. The\r\npatient does not know their composition. Even prescriptions are usually\r\nwritten in a language unintelligible to anybody but the druggist. As\r\nmuch secrecy is employed as in the preparation of proprietary medicines.\r\nDoes the fact that an article is prepared by a process known only to the\r\nmanufacturer render that article less valuable? How many physicians know\r\nthe elementary composition of the remedies which they employ, some of\r\nwhich never have been analyzed? Few practitioners know how morphine,\r\nquinine, podophyllin, leptandrin, pepsin, or chloroform, are made, or\r\nhow nauseous drugs are transformed into palatable elixirs; yet they do\r\nnot hesitate to employ them. Is it not inconsistent to use a\r\nprescription the composition of which is unknown to us, and discard\r\nanother preparation simply because it is accompanied by a printed\r\nstatement of its properties with directions for its use?\r\n\r\nVarious journals in this country, have at different times published\r\nabsurd formulae purporting to be receipts for the preparation of \"Dr.\r\nSage's Catarrh Remedy\" and Dr. Pierce's standard medicines, which, in\r\nmost instances, have not contained a single ingredient which enters into\r\nthe composition of these celebrated remedies.\r\n\r\nIn the manufacture of any pharmaceutical preparation, two conditions are\r\nessential to its perfection, viz: purity and strength of the materials,\r\nand appropriate machinery. The first is insured, by purchasing the\r\nmaterials in large quantities, whereby the exercise of greater care in\r\nselecting the ingredients can be afforded; and the second can only be\r\naccomplished where the business is extensive enough to warrant a large\r\noutlay of capital in procuring proper chemical apparatus. These facts\r\napply with especial force to the manufacture of our medicines, their\r\nquality having been vastly improved since the demand has become so great\r\nas to require their manufacture in very large quantities. Some persons,\r\nwhile admitting that our medicines are good pharmaceutical compounds,\r\nobject to them on the ground that they are too often used with\r\ninsufficient judgment. We propose to obviate that difficulty by\r\nenlightening the people as to the structure and functions of their\r\nbodies, the causes, character, and symptoms of disease, and by\r\nindicating the proper and judicious employment of our medicines,\r\ntogether with such auxiliary treatment as may be necessary. Such is one\r\nof the designs of this volume.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPERTIES OF MEDICINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is generally conceded that the action of a remedy upon the human\r\nsystem depends upon properties peculiar to it. The effects produced\r\nsuggest the naming of these qualities, which have been scientifically\r\nclassified. We shall name the diseases from their characteristic\r\nsymptoms, and then, without commenting upon all the properties of a\r\nremedy, recommend its employment. Our reference to the qualities of any\r\nremedy, when we do make a particular allusion to them, we shall endeavor\r\nto make as easy and familiar as possible.\r\n\r\nDOSE. All persons are not equally susceptible to the influence of\r\nmedicines. As a rule, women require smaller doses than men, and children\r\nless than women. Infants are very susceptible to the effects of\r\nanodynes, even out of all relative proportion to other kinds of\r\nmedicines. The circumstances and conditions of the system increase or\r\ndiminish the effects of medicine, so that an aperient at one time may\r\nact as a cathartic at another, and a dose that will simply prove to be\r\nan anodyne when the patient is suffering great pain will act as a\r\nnarcotic when he is not. This explains why the same dose often affects\r\nindividuals differently. The following table is given to indicate the\r\nsize of the dose, and is graduated to the age.\r\n\r\n    YEARS                DOSE\r\n    21. . . . . . . . . .full\r\n    15. . . . . . . . . . 2-3\r\n    12. . . . . . . . . . 1-2\r\n    8 . . . . . . . . . . 1-3\r\n    6 . . . . . . . . . . 1-4\r\n    4 . . . . . . . . . . 1-6\r\n    2 . . . . . . . . . . 1-8\r\n    1 . . . . . . . . . . 1-12\r\n    ½ . . . . . . 1-20 to 1-30\r\n\r\nThe doses mentioned in the following pages are those for adults, except\r\nwhen otherwise specified.\r\n\r\nTHE PREPARATION OF MEDICINES. The remedies which we shall mention for\r\ndomestic use are mostly vegetable. Infusions and decoctions of these\r\nwill often be advised on account of the fact that they are more\r\navailable than the tinctures, fluid extracts, and concentrated\r\nprinciples, which we prefer, and almost invariably employ in our\r\npractice. Most of these medical extracts are prepared in our chemical\r\nlaboratory under the supervision of a careful and skilled pharmaceutist.\r\nNo one, we presume, would expect, with only a dish of hot water and a\r\nstew-kettle, to equal in pharmaceutical skill the learned chemist with\r\nall his ingeniously devised and costly apparatus for extracting the\r\nactive, remedial principles from medicinal plants. Yet infusions and\r\ndecoctions are not without their value; and from the inferior quality of\r\nmany of the fluid extracts and other pharmaceutical preparations in the\r\nmarket, it may be questioned whether the former are not frequently as\r\nvaluable as the latter. So unreliable are a majority of the fluid\r\nextracts, tinctures, and concentrated, active principles found in the\r\ndrug-stores, that we long since found it necessary to have prepared in\r\nour laboratory, most of those which we employ. To the reliability of the\r\npreparations which we secure in this way we largely attribute our great\r\nsuccess in the treatment of disease. Tinctures and fluid extracts are\r\noften prepared from old and worthless roots, barks, and herbs which have\r\nwholly lost their medicinal properties. Yet they are sold at just as\r\nhigh prices as those which are good. We manufacture our tinctures, fluid\r\nextracts, and concentrated, active principles from roots, barks, and\r\nherbs which are fresh, and selected with the greatest care. Many of the\r\ncrude roots, barks, and herbs found in the market are inactive because\r\nthey have been gathered at the wrong season. These, together with those\r\nthat have been kept on hand so long as to have lost all medicinal value,\r\nare often sold in large quantities, and at reduced prices, to be\r\nmanufactured into fluid extracts and tinctures. Of course, the\r\npreparations made from such materials are worthless. Whenever the dose\r\nof fluid extracts, tinctures, and concentrated, active principles, is\r\nmentioned in this chapter, the quantity advised is based upon our\r\nexperience in the use of these preparations, as they are made in our\r\nlaboratory, and the smallest quantity which will produce the desired\r\neffect is always given. When using most of the preparations found in the\r\ndrug-stores, the doses have to be somewhat increased, and even then they\r\nwill not always produce the desired effect, for reasons already given.\r\n\r\nTHE LIST OF MEDICINES which we shall introduce in this chapter will be\r\nquite limited, as we cannot hope, by making it extensive, that the\r\nnon-professional reader would be able to prescribe with good judgment\r\nany other than the simpler remedies. Hence, we prefer, since we have not\r\nspace in this volume to waste, to mention only a few of the most common\r\nremedies under each head or classification.\r\n\r\nTINCTURES. Very uniform and reliable tinctures may be made of most\r\nindigenous plants, by procuring the part to be employed, at the proper\r\nseason, while it is green and fresh, bruising it well, and covering it\r\nwith good strong whiskey, or with alcohol diluted with one part of water\r\nto three of alcohol, corking tightly, and letting it stand about\r\nfourteen days, when the tincture may be filtered or poured off from the\r\ndrugs, and will be ready for use. Prepared in this imperfect manner,\r\nthey rill be found to be much more reliable than any of the fluid\r\nextracts found in the drug-stores. An excess of the crude drug should be\r\nused in preparing the tincture to insure a perfect saturation of the\r\nalcohol with its active principles.\r\n\r\nHOMOEOPATHIC TINCTURES. The tinctures prepared by several of the German\r\nand French pharmaceutists, and called by them \"Mother Tinctures,\" to\r\ndistinguish them from the dilutions made therefrom, we have found to be\r\nvery reliable, so much superior to any similar preparations made in this\r\ncountry that we purchase from them all we use of Pulsatilla,\r\nStaphisagria, Drosera and several others. They are prepared with great\r\ncare from the green, crude material, and although high in price, when\r\ncompared with other tinctures, yet the greater certainty of action which\r\nwe secure in our prescriptions by their employment more than repays for\r\nthe expense and trouble in procuring them, for of what account is\r\nexpense to the true physician when _life_ may depend upon the virtue of\r\nthe agent he employs?\r\n\r\nINFUSIONS. These are generally made by adding one-half ounce of the\r\ncrude medicine to a pint of water, which should be closely covered, kept\r\nwarm, and used as directed. Flowers, leaves, barks, and roots become\r\nimpaired by age, and it is necessary to increase or diminish the dose\r\naccording to the strength of the article employed.\r\n\r\nDECOCTIONS. The difference between a decoction and an infusion is, that\r\nthe plant or substance is boiled in the production of the former, in\r\norder to obtain its soluble, medicinal qualities. Cover the vessel\r\ncontaining the ingredients, thus confining the vapor, and shutting out\r\nthe atmospheric air which sometimes impairs the active principles and\r\ntheir medicinal qualities. The ordinary mode of preparing a decoction is\r\nto use one ounce of the plant, root, bark, flower, or substance to a\r\npint of water. The dose internally varies from a tablespoonful to one\r\nounce.\r\n\r\n\r\nALTERATIVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlteratives are a class of medicines which in some inexplicable manner,\r\ngradually change certain morbid actions of the system, and establish a\r\nhealthy condition instead. They stimulate the vital processes to renewed\r\nactivity, and arouse the excretory organs to remove matter which ought\r\nto be eliminated. They facilitate the action of the secretory glands,\r\ntone them up, and give a new impulse to their operations, so that they\r\ncan more expeditiously rid the system of worn-out and effete materials.\r\nIn this way they alter, correct, and purify the fluids, tone up the\r\norgans, and re-establish their healthy functions. Alteratives may\r\npossess tonic, laxative, stimulant, or diuretic properties all combined\r\nin one agent. Or we may combine several alteratives, each having only\r\none of these properties in one remedy. We propose to enumerate only a\r\nfew alteratives, and give the doses which are usually prescribed; the\r\nlist which we employ in our practice is very extensive, but it cannot be\r\nmade available for domestic use.\r\n\r\nMANDRAKE (_Podophyllum Peltatum_), also called May-apple, is a most\r\nvaluable alterative. The root is the part used. _Dose_--Of decoction,\r\none to two teaspoonfuls; of tincture, six to eight drops; of fluid\r\nextract, three to five drops; of its active principle, Podophyllin,\r\none-twelfth to one-eighth of a grain.\r\n\r\nPOKE (_Phytolacca Decandra_), also called Skoke, Garget, or\r\nPigeon-berry, is a valuable alterative. The root is the part used.\r\n_Dose_--Of decoction, one to three teaspoonfuls; of fluid extract, three\r\nto ten drops; of concentrated principle, Phytolaccin, one-fourth to one\r\ngrain.\r\n\r\nYELLOW DOCK (_Rumex Crispus_), The part used is the root. _Dose_--Of the\r\ninfusion, one to three fluid ounces three times daily; of fluid extract,\r\nten to thirty drops; of tincture twenty to forty drops.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 113.\r\nTag Alder. ]\r\n\r\nTAG ALDER (_Alnus Rubra_), This is otherwise known as the Smooth,\r\nCommon, or Swamp Alder. The bark is the part used. It is excellent in\r\nscrofula, syphilis, cutaneous and all blood diseases. _Dose_--Of\r\ndecoction, one or two tablespoonfuls from three to five times daily; of\r\ntincture, one or two teaspoonfuls; of fluid extract, one-half to one\r\nteaspoonful; of concentrated principle, Alnuin, one-half to one grain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 114.\r\nBlack Cohosh. ]\r\n\r\nBLACK COHOSH (_Macrotys or Cimicifuga Racemosa_) The part used is the\r\nroot. Its other common names are Black Snake-root, or Squaw-root. Black\r\nCohosh is an alterative stimulant, nervine, diaphoretic, tonic, and a\r\ncerebro-spinal stimulant. It is a useful remedy. _Dose_--Of decoction,\r\none-fourth to one ounce; of tincture, ten to fifteen drops; of fluid\r\nextract, five to ten drops; of the concentrated principle, Macrotin,\r\none-eighth to one-half grain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 115.\r\nBlood-root. ]\r\n\r\nBLOOD-ROOT (_Sanguinaria Canadensis_), is also known as Red Puccoon. The\r\npart used is the root. In minute doses Blood-root is a valuable\r\nalterative, acting upon the biliary secretion and improving the\r\ncirculation and digestion. _Dose_--Of powdered root, one-fourth to\r\none-half grain; of tincture, one to two drops; of the fluid extract,\r\none-half to one drop. When given in a fluid form it should be well\r\ndiluted.\r\n\r\nBURDOCK (_Arctium Lappa_). The root is the part used. Burdock is a\r\nvaluable alterative in diseases of the blood. _Dose_--Of tincture, from\r\none teaspoonful to a tablespoonful twenty minutes before meals; of fluid\r\nextract, one to two teaspoonfuls.\r\n\r\nBLUE FLAG (_Iris Versicolor_). The part used is the root. _Dose_--Of the\r\ntincture, five to ten drops; of fluid extract, three to ten drops; of\r\nconcentrated principle, Iridin, one-half to two grains.\r\n\r\nSWEET ELDER (_Sambucus Canadensis_). Sweet Elder-flowers are a valuable\r\nalterative, diuretic, mucous and glandular stimulant, excellent in\r\neruptive, cutaneous, and scrofulous diseases of children. An infusion,\r\nfluid extract, or syrup, may be used in connection with the \"Golden\r\nMedical Discovery.\" Both will be found valuable for cleansing the blood\r\nand stimulating the functions to a healthy condition. _Dose_--Of the\r\ninfusion of the flowers, from one-half to one ounce, if freely taken,\r\nwill operate as a laxative; of fluid extract, one-fourth to one-half\r\nteaspoonful. The flowers, or inner bark of the root, simmered in fresh\r\nbutter, make a good ointment for most cutaneous affections.\r\n\r\nIODINE. This agent, in the several forms of Iodide of Potassium, Iodide\r\nof Ammonium, Iodide of Iron, and Iodide of Lime, is largely employed by\r\nphysicians, and often with most happy results. But for domestic use we\r\ncannot advise its employment, as it is liable to injure the invalid,\r\nwhen its action is carried too far, which is apt to be the case, when\r\nnot administered under the supervision of a competent physician.\r\n\r\nMERCURY. The various preparations of mercury have a profound, alterative\r\neffect upon the system. When taken for some time, they change the\r\nquality and composition of the blood; cause a diminution in the number\r\nof red blood-corpuscles, and an increase in the various effete\r\nmaterials. In the vast majority of cases we prefer the vegetable\r\nalteratives, but in rare instances they exert a beneficial influence, in\r\nsmall doses. None of the preparations of mercury should be taken\r\ninternally without the advice of a skillful physician, therefore, we\r\nshall not give their doses.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMPOUNDING OF ALTERATIVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe efficacy of this class of remedies can be greatly increased by\r\nproperly combining several of them into one compound.\r\n\r\nThis requires a knowledge of Pharmaceutical Chemistry; i.e., the\r\npreparation of compounds founded on the chemical relation and action of\r\ntheir several remedial, active principles. Many practitioners make\r\ncombinations of remedies which neutralize each other's influence,\r\ninstead of extending their efficacy and curative power.\r\n\r\nDR. PIERCE'S \"GOLDEN MEDICAL DISCOVERY,\" or Alterative Extract. This\r\ncompound is a highly nutritive and tonic preparation, combining the\r\nremedial properties of the best vegetable alteratives at present known\r\nto the medical profession. In perfecting this alterative compound, and\r\nlikewise other standard preparations of medicine, we have made an outlay\r\nof many thousand dollars for chemical apparatus, and special machinery\r\nby the aid of which these remedies have been brought to their present\r\nperfection. Great pains are taken to obtain the materials at the right\r\nseason of the year, properly cured so that none of their remedial\r\nqualities may be impaired. We, therefore, can with great confidence\r\nrecommend Dr. Pierce's \"Golden Medical Discovery\" as one of the best\r\npreparations of the alterative class. Like all others of this type, its\r\naction is insensible, producing gradual changes, arousing the excretory\r\nglands to remove morbid materials, and at the same time toning the\r\nsecretory organs. The manufacture of this compound is under the special\r\nsupervision of a competent chemist and pharmaceutist, and it is now put\r\nup in bottles wrapped with full directions for its use. We can\r\nconfidently recommend this compound whenever an alterative is required\r\nto cleanse the blood, tone the system, increase its nutrition, and\r\nestablish a healthy condition. For these reasons we shall often advise\r\nits employment.\r\n\r\nDR. PIERCE'S PLEASANT PURGATIVE PELLETS. These pellets combine the pure,\r\nconcentrated, active principles of several vegetable alteratives, and\r\nthe result is, that within the small compass of a few grains he has most\r\nhappily blended and chemically condensed these properties so that their\r\naction upon the ANIMAL ECONOMY is sanative and universal. They awaken\r\nthe latent powers, quicken the tardy functions, check morbid deposits,\r\ndissolve hard concretions, remove obstructions, promote depuration,\r\nharmonize and restore the functions, equalize the circulation, and\r\nencourage the action of the nervous system. They stimulate the glands,\r\nincrease the peristaltic movement of the intestines, tone the nutritive\r\nprocesses, while aiding in evacuating the bowels. All this they\r\naccomplish without corroding the tissues or vitiating the fluids. Their\r\nassistance is genial, helping the system to expel worn out materials,\r\nwhich would become noxious if retained. Having expended their remedial\r\npowers upon the various functions of the body, they are themselves\r\nexpelled along with other waste matter, leaving behind them no traces of\r\nirritation. This cannot be said of mercurials, or of other harsh,\r\nmineral alteratives. These Pellets may be safely employed when the\r\nsystem is feeble, frail, and delicate, by giving them in less\r\nquantities. _Dose_--As an alterative, only one or two Pellets should be\r\ntaken daily.\r\n\r\n\r\nALKALIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nALKALIES. These constitute an important list of remedial agents, their\r\nadministration being frequently indicated. The employment of other\r\nmedicines frequently should be preceded by the administration of an\r\nagent of this class, to neutralize excessive acidity in the stomach and\r\nbowels. Unless this be done, many medicines will fail to produce their\r\nspecific effects.\r\n\r\nSULPHITE OF SODA (_Sodæ Sulphis_). This salt, as well as the\r\nHyposulphite of Soda, is not only generally preferable for\r\nadministration on account of its unirritating character and the\r\nsmallness of the dose required, but also because it is a valuable\r\nantiseptic agent. The _Sulphite_ should not be confounded with the\r\n_Sulphate_ of Soda (Glauber's Salt). _Dose_--This is from three to ten\r\ngrains.\r\n\r\nSALERATUS (_Potassæ Bicarbonas_). This is a favorite domestic antacid.\r\n_Dose_--Five to fifteen grains is the amount.\r\n\r\n\r\nACIDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs alkalies are important and often indicated as remedial agents, acids,\r\nso their re-agents, acids, are also frequently necessary to meet\r\nopposite conditions of the fluids of the system.\r\n\r\nHYDROCHLORIC OR MURIATIC ACID. This agent may be administered in doses\r\nof from five to ten drops, largely diluted in water or gruel.\r\n\r\nAROMATIC SULPHURIC ACID, or Elixir of Vitriol, is the most agreeable\r\nform of Sulphuric Acid for administration, and may be given in doses of\r\nfrom five to fifteen drops, largely diluted with water.\r\n\r\nIn taking acids, they should be sucked through a straw, and not allowed\r\nto come in contact with the teeth, as otherwise the latter organs will\r\nbe injured by their effects; or should the acid come in contact with the\r\nteeth, the mouth should be immediately rinsed with a solution of\r\nsaleratus or soda, to neutralize the acid.\r\n\r\n\r\nANODYNES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnodynes are those medicines which relieve pain by blunting the\r\nsensibility of the nerves, or of the brain, so that it does not\r\nappreciate the morbid sensation. An anodyne may be a stimulant in one\r\ndose, and a narcotic in a larger one. The properties of different\r\nanodyne agents vary, consequently they produce unlike effects. The size\r\nof the dose required, differs according to circumstances and condition.\r\nAn adult, suffering acute pain, requires a much larger dose to produce\r\nan anodyne effect than one who is a chronic sufferer. An individual\r\naccustomed to the use of anodynes, requires a much larger dose to\r\nprocure relief than one who is not. Doses may be repeated, until their\r\ncharacteristic effects are produced, after an interval of thirty or\r\nforty minutes. When the stomach is very sensitive and will not tolerate\r\ntheir internal administration, one-sixth of a grain of Morphia can be\r\ninserted beneath the skin, by means of a hypodermic syringe. Relief is\r\nmore quickly experienced, and the anodyne effect is much more lasting\r\nthan when taken into the stomach.\r\n\r\nOPIUM (_Papaver Somniferum)._ Opium is a stimulant, anodyne, or\r\nnarcotic, according to the size of the dose administered. _Dose_--Of the\r\ndry powder, one-fourth to one grain; of tincture (Laudanum), five to\r\nfifteen drops; of camphorated tincture (Paregoric), one-half to one\r\nteaspoonful; of\r\n\r\nMorphine, one-eighth to one-fourth grain; of Dover's Powder three to\r\nfive grains.\r\n\r\nHYOSCYAMUS (_Hyoscyamus Niger_), commonly known as Henbane. The herb is\r\nused. It is a powerful narcotic, and unlike Opium, does not constipate\r\nthe bowels, but possesses a laxative tendency. Therefore, it may be\r\nemployed as an anodyne for allaying pain, calming the mind, inducing\r\nsleep and arresting spasms, when opiates are inadmissible. _Dose_--Of\r\nalcoholic extract, one-half to two grains; of fluid extract, five to ten\r\ndrops; of the concentrated principle, Hyoscyamin, one-twelfth to\r\none-fourth of a grain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 116.\r\nPoison Hemlock. ]\r\n\r\nPOISON HEMLOCK (_Conium Maculatum_). The leaves are the parts used.\r\nPoison Parsley, as it is sometimes called, is an anodyne, narcotic, and\r\nan excellent alterative. _Dose_--Of fluid extract, two to six drops; of\r\nsolid extract, one-fourth to one-half grain.\r\n\r\nBELLADONNA (_Atropa Belladonna_) or Deadly Nightshade. The herb or\r\nleaves are a valuable agent. In overdoses, it is an energetic, narcotic\r\npoison. In medicinal doses it is anodyne, antispasmodic, diaphoretic,\r\nand diuretic. It is excellent in neuralgia, epilepsy, mania, amaurosis,\r\nwhooping-cough, stricture, rigidity of the os uteri, and is supposed by\r\nsome to be a prophylactic or preventive of Scarlet Fever. Its influence\r\nupon the nerve centers is remarkable. It relaxes the blood vessels on\r\nthe surface of the body and induces capillary congestion, redness of the\r\neye, scarlet appearance of the face, tongue, and body. _Dose_--Of fluid\r\nextract, one-half to one drop; of tincture, one to two drops; of\r\nconcentrated principle, Atropin, one-thirtieth to one-sixteenth of a\r\ngrain; of the _Alkaloid, Atropia_, one-sixtieth of a grain. Even the\r\nmost skillful chemists are very cautious in compounding these latter\r\nactive principles, and the danger of an overdose is great.\r\n\r\nCAMPHOR. This drug is an anodyne, stimulant, and diaphoretic, and, in\r\nlarge doses, a narcotic and an irritant. It is an excellent stimulant\r\nfor liniments. _Dose_--Of the powder, one to five grains; of the\r\ntincture, ten to twenty drops, given in simple syrup.\r\n\r\nHOPS (_Humulus Lupulus_). This is an excellent remedy in wakefulness,\r\nand may be used when opium is contra-indicated. A bag of the leaves,\r\nmoistened with whiskey and placed as a pillow under the head, acts as an\r\nanodyne. _Dose_--Of the infusion of the leaves, from one to four ounces;\r\nof the fluid extract, one-fourth to three-fourths of a teaspoonful; of\r\nthe concentrated principle, Humulin, one to three grains.\r\n\r\nDR. PIERCE'S COMPOUND EXTRACT OF SMART-WEED. This anodyne compound is\r\nmade by uniting several of the most valuable agents of this class, and\r\nits medicinal qualities are rendered still more efficacious by the\r\naddition of certain stimulating articles. It is free from narcotic\r\nproperties which are liable to produce deleterious results, and has been\r\nfound to be not only harmless in its action, but very genial and\r\neffectual withal, and most reliable as a stimulant and diaphoretic\r\nremedy.\r\n\r\n\r\nANTHELMINTICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnthelmintic means \"against a worm,\" and is a term employed to designate\r\nthose medicines which destroy or expel worms. It means the same as\r\n_Vermifuge_. Little is understood concerning the origin of worms. There\r\nare five distinct varieties described by authors as being more common\r\nthan others. There is the long worm, the short, or pin-worm, the\r\nthread-worm, the tape-worm, and the broad tape-worm peculiar to some\r\ncountries of Europe. Irritation of the alimentary canal, from whatever\r\ncause usually produces an abundant secretion of mucus, which is thought\r\nto be a condition favorable for their production. Therefore, those\r\nmedicines which remove the cause of this irritation tend to diminish the\r\nnumber, if not to entirely destroy the worms. Some medicines kill the\r\nworms, others expel them alive. The remedies which successfully remove\r\none kind of worm, have little effect upon another, and to meet these\r\ndifferent conditions, we have a variety of worm-destroying medicines.\r\nThe pin-worm, inhabits the rectum, and may be destroyed by injecting\r\ninto it a strong solution of salt, or decoction of aloes, and when it is\r\nallowed to pass away, the rectum should be anointed with vaseline,\r\nbutter, or lard. The eggs of this worm are developed around the orifice\r\nof the large intestine, and when this latter precaution is not practiced\r\nevery time there is a passage from the bowels, they will multiply as\r\nrapidly as they can be destroyed. Generally, vermifuge remedies should\r\nbe taken when the stomach is empty, and should be followed by the\r\nadministration of a cathartic in two hours after the last dose is\r\nadministered.\r\n\r\nSANTONIN. This is decidedly the most reliable anthelmintic known to the\r\nmedical profession. It is deservedly a popular remedy for worms, and\r\nwhen combined with Podophyllin, is very efficacious in removing the\r\npin-worm. _Dose_--For an adult, two to three grains of the powdered\r\nSantonin, repeated every three hours until four or five doses are taken,\r\nwhen it should be followed by a cathartic.\r\n\r\nSAGE (_Salvia Officinalis_). Sage is a common and excellent domestic\r\nremedy for worms. Make an infusion of Sage and Senna leaves, and drink\r\nfreely until it acts as a cathartic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 117.\r\nPink Root.]\r\n\r\nPINK-ROOT (_Spigelia Marilandica_). Pink-root is one of the most active\r\nand certain anthelmintics for children. It is indigenous to the United\r\nStates. When taken in too large quantities, it is apt to purge, give\r\nrise to vertigo, dimness of vision, and even to convulsions; therefore,\r\nit should be combined with some cathartic. _Dose_--Of the infusion, one\r\nounce at night, followed by physic in the morning.\r\n\r\nCOMMON SALT (_Chloride of Sodium_). Common table salt is an\r\nanthelmintic, and may be used in an emergency. Salt water is a very\r\ncommon domestic remedy for worms. _Dose_--In solution, one-quarter to\r\none-half teaspoonful.\r\n\r\nBALMONY (_Chelone Glabra_). This is also tonic and anthelmintic, and is\r\nvaluable in debility, dyspepsia, jaundice, and hepatic affections. It\r\nalso is known as Snake-head. _Dose_--Of the infusion, one to two ounces;\r\nof the concentrated principle, Chelonin, from half to one grain.\r\n\r\nMALE FERN (_Aspidium Filix Mas_). Male Fern is the anthelmintic which is\r\nconsidered especially effectual in removing the tape-worm. _Dose_--Of\r\nthe powder, one to two drachms, given morning and evening in syrup,\r\nfollowed by a brisk cathartic. The dose of the tincture of the buds in\r\nether is from eight to thirty drops.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 118.\r\nAspen.]\r\n\r\nPOPLAR (_Populus Tremuloides_). The White or Aspen Poplar is a common\r\ntree, and contains active principles termed Populin and Salicin, both of\r\nwhich are tonic. An infusion of the bark is a remedy for worms.\r\n_Dose_--Of the tea made from the bark, one to four ounces; of Populin,\r\nfrom one-half to two grains.\r\n\r\n\r\nANTIPERIODICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is well understood that malarial diseases are characterized by a\r\nperiodicity which indicates their nature. Antiperiodics prevent the\r\nrecurrence of the periodic manifestations, and hence their name.\r\n\r\nQUININE (_Sulphate of Quinia_). Quinine is a tonic, febrifuge, and\r\nantiperiodic. It should generally be administered during the intervals\r\nbetween the febrile paroxysms. It is beneficial also in all diseases\r\naccompanied by debility. The dose varies from one to six grains\r\naccording to indications. Frequently it is given in much larger\r\nquantities, but we cannot advise such for domestic use.\r\n\r\nPRUSSIAN BLUE (_Ferri Ferrocyanidum_). Ferrocyanide of Iron is an\r\nexcellent tonic and antiperiodic remedy, and often is combined with\r\nquinine. _Dose_--From two to five grains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 119.\r\nBoneset. ]\r\n\r\nBONESET (_Eupatorium Perfoliatum_), or Thoroughwort. This is tonic,\r\ndiaphoretic, aperient, and possesses some antiperiodic properties; the\r\nwarm infusion is emetic. _Dose_--Of the infusion, one to four ounces; of\r\nthe fluid extract, from half to one teaspoonful; of the active\r\nprinciple, Eupatorin, one to three grains.\r\n\r\nTHE \"GOLDEN MEDICAL DISCOVERY\" has gained an enviable reputation in\r\nmalarial districts for the cure of ague. From observing its action in\r\nthe cure of this and other miasmatic diseases, and knowing its\r\ncomposition, we are thoroughly satisfied that it contains chemical\r\nproperties which neutralize and destroy the miasmatic or ague poison\r\nwhich is in the system, and, at the same time, produces a rapid\r\nexcretion of the neutralized poisons. One strong proof of this is found\r\nin the fact that persons who are cured with it are not so liable to\r\nrelapse as those in whom the chills are broken with Quinine or other\r\nagents. No bad effects are experienced after an attack of ague which has\r\nbeen cured with the \"Golden Medical Discovery.\" This cannot be said of\r\nQuinine, Peruvian Bark, Arsenic, and Mercurials, which comprise nearly\r\nthe whole list of remedies usually resorted to by physicians for\r\narresting ague. The \"Golden Medical Discovery\" not only has the merit of\r\nbeing a certain antidote for miasmatic diseases, but is pleasant to the\r\ntaste, a matter of no small importance, especially when administered to\r\nchildren. To break the chills, this medicine should be taken in doses of\r\nfour teaspoonfuls three times a day, and if this treatment pursued for\r\nthree days, does not entirely arrest the chills, these doses may be\r\nrepeated in alternation with five-grain doses of quinine for the three\r\nsucceeding days. But in no case should more than this amount of the\r\n\"Golden Medical Discovery\" be given.\r\n\r\n\r\nANTISEPTICS AND DISINFECTANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAntiseptics prevent, while disinfectants arrest putrefaction. Oxygen is\r\na natural disinfectant, but a powerful inciter of change. Although this\r\nelement is the cause of animal and vegetable decay, yet oxidation is the\r\ngrand process by which the earth, air, and sea are purified. A few\r\nsubstances are both antiseptic and disinfectant. Heat up to a\r\ntemperature of 140° Fahr. promotes putrescence, but above that point, is\r\na drier or disorganizer, and destroys the source of infection.\r\n\r\nYEAST (_Cerevisiæ Fermentum_). Yeast is an antiseptic, and is effective\r\nin all diseases in which there is threatened putridity. Used externally,\r\nit is often combined with elm bark and charcoal, and applied to ulcers,\r\nin which there is a tendency to gangrene. _Dose_--One tablespoonful in\r\nwine or porter, once in two or three hours.\r\n\r\nCREASOTE. This is a powerful antiseptic. It is used in a solution of\r\nglycerine, oil, water, or syrup. _Dose_--One to two drops, largely\r\ndiluted.\r\n\r\nCARBOLIC ACID is a crystalline substance resembling creasote in its\r\nproperties. It is an antiseptic, and is used both internally and\r\nexternally. _Dose_--One-fourth to one-half drop of the melted crystals,\r\nvery largely diluted. Externally, in solution, one to five grains of the\r\ncrystals to one ounce of the solvent.\r\n\r\nWHITE VITRIOL (_Zinci Sulphas_). White vitriol is a valuable\r\ndisinfectant, as it will arrest mortification. In solution it is\r\nemployed in ulcers and cancers and also as a gargle in putrid sore\r\nthroat. _Dose_--One-half to two grains in a pill; in solution, one to\r\nten grains in an ounce of water.\r\n\r\nPERMANGANATE OF POTASH (_Potassæ Permanganas_). This substance is an\r\nenergetic deodorizer and disinfectant. A solution containing from one to\r\ntwenty grains in an ounce of water is used as a lotion for foul ulcers.\r\n_Dose_--One-eighth to one-fourth of a grain.\r\n\r\nWILD INDIGO (_Baptisia Tinctoria_). The root is the part used. This\r\nplant possesses valuable antiseptic properties. It is an excellent\r\nlotion for ill-conditioned ulcers, malignant sore throat, nursing\r\nsore-mouth, syphilitic ophthalmia, etc. It is sometimes administered in\r\nscarlet and typhus fevers, and in all diseases in which there is a\r\ntendency to putrescence. _Dose_--Of the infusion, one-fourth to one-half\r\nounce; of the fluid extract, from three to ten drops, and of the\r\nconcentrated, active principle of the plant, Baptisin, from one to two\r\ngrains.\r\n\r\n\r\nANTISPASMODICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAntispasmodics are a class of remedies which relieve cramps,\r\nconvulsions, and spasms, and are closely allied to nervines. Indeed some\r\nauthors class them together. The following are a few of the most\r\nimportant antispasmodics:\r\n\r\nASSAFETIDA (_Assafetida Ferula_). This is a powerful antispasmodic. It\r\nis employed in hysteria, hypochondria, convulsions, and spasms, when\r\nunaccompanied by inflammation. _Dose_--Of the gum or powder, from three\r\nto ten grains, usually administered in the form of a pill; of the\r\ntincture, from one-half to one teaspoonful.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 120.\r\nYellow Jessamine.]\r\n\r\nYELLOW JESSAMINE (_Gelseminum Sempervirens_). The root is the part used.\r\nThis is a valuable remedy in various\r\n\r\ndiseases when associated with restlessness and a determination of the\r\nblood to the brain; also in the neuralgia. _Dose_--Of the fluid extract,\r\nthree to eight drops; of the concentrated principle, Gelsemin,\r\none-fourth to one grain. The use of this drug by non-professional\r\npersons should be attended with great caution.\r\n\r\nVALERIAN (_Valeriana Officinalis_). The root is the part used. Valerian\r\nis an effective remedy in cases of nervousness and restlessness.\r\n_Dose_--Of the infusion, (one-half ounce to a pint of water) one-half\r\nounce; of the tincture, one-half to two tablespoonfuls; of the\r\nammoniated tincture of valerian, from one-half to two teaspoonfuls in\r\nsweetened water or milk; of the valerianate of ammonia, one-half to\r\nthree grains.\r\n\r\nYELLOW LADY'S SLIPPER (_Cypripedium Pubescens_). The root is the part\r\nused. This is a useful remedy in hysteria, chorea, and all cases of\r\nirritability. _Dose_--Of the powder, fifteen to thirty grains; of the\r\ninfusion, one ounce; of the fluid extract, fifteen to thirty drops; of\r\nthe concentrated principle, Cypripedin, one-half to two grains.\r\n\r\nWILD YAM (_Dioscorea Villosa_). The root is the part used. This is a\r\npowerful antispasmodic, and has been successfully used in bilious colic,\r\nnausea, and spasm of the bowels. _Dose_--Of the infusion (two ounces to\r\na pint of water), one to two ounces; of the fluid extract, five to\r\nfifteen drops; of the concentrated principle, Dioscorein, one-half to\r\none grain.\r\n\r\nHIGH CRANBERRY (_Viburnum Opulus._) The bark is the part used. It is\r\nalso known as Cramp Bark. This is a powerful antispasmodic, and is\r\neffective in relaxing spasms of all kinds. It is a valuable agent in\r\nthreatened abortion. _Dose_--Of the infusion, one-half to one ounce; of\r\nthe fluid extract, one-half to one teaspoonful; of the concentrated\r\nprinciple, Viburnin, one-half to two grains. These doses may be\r\nincreased if necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nASTRINGENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAstringents are medicines which condense and coagulate the tissues,\r\nthereby arresting discharges. When taken into the mouth, they produce\r\nthe sensation known as puckering. They are used internally and locally.\r\nThe term _styptic_ is used as a synonym of astringent, but is generally\r\nemployed to designate those astringents which arrest hemorrhage, or\r\nbleeding.\r\n\r\nLOGWOOD (_Hæmatoxylon Campechianum_). Logwood is a mild astringent,\r\nwell adapted to remedy the relaxed condition of the bowels after cholera\r\ninfantum. _Dose_--Of powdered extract, five to ten grains; of the\r\ndecoction, one ounce; of the fluid extract, fifteen to thirty drops.\r\n\r\nBLACKBERRY ROOT (_Rubus Villosus_). This astringent is a favorite,\r\ndomestic remedy in affections of the bowels. _Dose_--Of the infusion\r\n(bruised root), one-half to one ounce, sweetened.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 121.\r\nWitch-hazel. ]\r\n\r\nWITCH-HAZEL (_Hamamelis Virginica_). The parts used are the leaves and\r\nbark. This is a most valuable astringent and exerts a specific action\r\nupon the nervous system. It arrests many forms of uterine hemorrhage\r\nwith great promptness, is a valuable agent in the treatment of piles,\r\nand is useful in many forms of chronic throat and bronchial affections.\r\n_Dose_-Of the infusion, one-fourth to one-half ounce; of the fluid\r\nextract, eight to fifteen grains; of the concentrated principle,\r\nHamamelin, one fourth to one grain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 122.\r\nCranesbill. ]\r\n\r\nCRANESBILL (_Geranium Maculatum_). The root is used. This plant is also\r\nknown as Crow-foot, and Spotted Geranium. It is a pleasant, but powerful\r\nastringent. _Dose_--Of the fluid extract, ten to thirty drops; of the\r\nconcentrated principle, Geranin, one to two grains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 123.\r\nBugle-weed. ]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 124.\r\nHardhack. ]\r\n\r\nHARDHACK (_Spirea Tomentosa_), Spirea, or Meadow Sweet. The stem and\r\nleaves are used. It is a tonic and an astringent, and is used in\r\ndiarrhea and cholera-infantum. _Dose_--Of the infusion, one-half to one\r\nounce; of the fluid extract, three to six drops.\r\n\r\nBUGLE-WEED (_Lycopus Virginicus_). This is variously known as\r\nWater-hoarhound and Water-bugle. It is sedative and tonic, as well as\r\nastringent, and is employed in hemorrhages and in incipient phthisis.\r\n_Dose_--Of the infusion, one to two ounces; of the fluid extract,\r\nfifteen to twenty-five drops; of the concentrated principle, Lycopin,\r\none-half to one grain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 125.\r\nCanada Fleabane. ]\r\n\r\nCANADA FLEABANE (_Erigeron Canadense_). The leaves and flowers are used.\r\nThis plant, sometimes known as Colt's-tail, Pride-weed, or Butter-weed,\r\nis astringent, and has been efficiently employed in uterine hemorrhages.\r\n_Dose_--Of the infusion (two ounces of the herb to one pint of water),\r\none to two ounces; of the oil, five to ten drops on sugar, repeated at\r\nintervals of from one to four hours.\r\n\r\nCATECHU (_Acacia Catechu_). A tincture of this plant is a pure, powerful\r\nastringent, and is especially useful in chronic diarrhea, chronic\r\ncatarrh, and chronic dysentery. _Dose_--Of the powder, five to twenty\r\ngrains; of the tincture, one-half to two teaspoonfuls.\r\n\r\nTANNIN (_Acidum, Tannicum_). This acid has a wide range of application.\r\nIt is used as an astringent. _Dose_--One to five grains.\r\n\r\nGALLIC ACID (_Acidum Gallicum_). This remedy is used chiefly in\r\nhemorrhages. _Dose_--Three to five grains. In severe hemorrhages, this\r\nquantity should be administered every half hour, until the bleeding is\r\nchecked.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARMINATIVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nCarminatives are medicines which allay intestinal pain, arrest or\r\nprevent griping caused by cathartics and exert a general soothing\r\neffect. They are aromatic, and to a certain extent, stimulant.\r\n\r\nANISE-SEED (_Pimpinella Anisum_). Anise is a pleasant, aromatic\r\ncarminative, and is used in flatulent colic. _Dose_--Of the powdered\r\nseed, ten to fifteen grains; of the infusion (a teaspoonful of seed to a\r\ngill of water), sweetened, may be given freely; of the oil, five to ten\r\ndrops on sugar.\r\n\r\nFENNEL-SEED (_Anethum Foeniculum_). This is one of our most grateful\r\naromatics, and is sometimes employed to modify the action of senna and\r\nrhubarb. _Dose_--Same as that of anise-seed.\r\n\r\nGINGER (_Zingiber Officinale_). The root is the part used. This is a\r\ngrateful stimulant and carminative. _Dose_--Of the powder, ten to twenty\r\ngrains; of the infusion, one teaspoonful in a gill of water; of the\r\ntincture, twenty to thirty drops; of the essence, ten to fifteen drops;\r\nof the syrup, one teaspoonful.\r\n\r\nWINTERGREEN (_Gaultheria Procumbens_). The leaves are used. This plant\r\npossesses stimulant, aromatic, and astringent properties. The essence of\r\nWintergreen is carminative, and is used in colics. _Dose_--Of the\r\nessence, one-half to one teaspoonful in sweetened water; of the oil,\r\nthree to five drops on sugar.\r\n\r\nPEPPERMINT (_Mentha Piperita_). Peppermint is a powerful stimulant,\r\ncarminative, and antispasmodic. It is used in the treatment of spasms,\r\ncolic, and hysteria. _Dose_--The infusion may be used freely. The\r\nessence may be taken in doses of fifteen to thirty drops in sweetened\r\nwarm water; of the oil, one to five drops on sugar.\r\n\r\nSPEARMINT (_Mentha Viridis_). The carminative properties of spearmint\r\nare inferior to those of peppermint, and its chief employment is for its\r\ndiuretic and febrifuge virtues. _Dose_--Same as that of peppermint.\r\n\r\nCOMPOUND EXTRACT OF SMART-WEED. Dr. Pierce's Extract of Smart-weed is a\r\nvaluable carminative and aromatic stimulant, and has been employed with\r\nmarked success in all diseases in which this class of remedies is\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\n\r\nCATHARTICS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cathartics_, or _Purgatives_ are medicines which act upon the bowels\r\nand increase the secretions and evacuations. In many parts of the\r\ncountry, these agents are known as purges, or physics. They have been\r\nvariously divided and subdivided, usually with reference to the energy\r\nof their operations or the character of the evacuations produced.\r\n\r\n_Laxatives_, or _Aperients_, are mild cathartics. Purgatives act with\r\nmore energy and produce several discharges which are of a more liquid\r\ncharacter and more copious than the former.\r\n\r\n_Drastics_ are those cathartics which produce numerous evacuations\r\naccompanied by more or less intestinal irritation.\r\n\r\n_Hydragogues_ are those purgatives which produce copious, watery\r\ndischarges.\r\n\r\n_Cholagogues_ are those purgatives which act upon the liver, stimulating\r\nits functions. Cathartics constitute a class of remedies which are\r\nalmost universally employed by families and physicians.\r\n\r\nJALAP (_Ipomoea Jalapa_). The root is used. It is a drastic and a\r\nhydragogue cathartic. Formerly it was combined with equal parts of\r\ncalomel. From this fact it received the name of \"ten and ten.\"\r\n_Dose_--Of the powder, five to twenty grains; of the fluid extract, ten\r\nto fifteen drops; of the solid extract, two to four grains; of the\r\nconcentrated principle, Jalapin, one-half to two grains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 126.\r\nCulver's-root. ]\r\n\r\nGAMBOGE (_Gambogia_). The gum is used. Gamboge is a powerful drastic,\r\nhydragogue cathartic, which is apt to produce nausea and vomiting. It is\r\nemployed in dropsy. It should never be given alone, but combined with\r\nmilder cathartics. It accelerates their action while they moderate its\r\nviolence. _Dose_--Of the powder, one-half to two grains. This substance\r\ncombined with aloes and sometimes with scammony, constitutes the basis\r\nof the numerous varieties of large, cathartic pills found in the market.\r\n\r\nCULVER'S-ROOT. (_Leptandra Virginica_). The root is used. This plant,\r\nknown under the various names of Culver's Physic, Black-root, Tall\r\nSpeedwell, and Indian Physic, is a certain cholagogue, laxative, and\r\ncathartic. _Dose_--Of decoction, one to two fluid ounces; of fluid\r\nextract, ten to twenty drops; of tincture, twenty to thirty drops; of\r\nthe concentrated, active principle, Leptandrin, which is but feebly\r\ncathartic, as a laxative, two to five grains.\r\n\r\nRHUBARB (_Rheum Palmatum_). This is much used as a domestic remedy, and\r\nby the profession, for its laxative, tonic, and astringent effects. It\r\nis employed in bowel complaints. _Dose_--Of the powder, ten to thirty\r\ngrains; of the tincture, one-half to two teaspoonfuls; of the fluid\r\nextract, ten to thirty drops; of the solid extract, three to five\r\ngrains; of the syrup, and aromatic syrup, an excellent remedy for\r\nchildren, one-half to one teaspoonful.\r\n\r\nCASCARA SAGRADA (_Rhamnus Purshiana_), is a very efficient remedy in\r\nchronic constipation. _Dose_--Of the fluid extract, from ten to twenty\r\ndrops taken in a tablespoonful of water. The unpleasant taste may be\r\ndisguised with the extract of liquorice.\r\n\r\nCASTOR OIL (_Oleum Ricini_). _Dose_--From one to four teaspoonfuls. It\r\nmay be disguised by rubbing it with an equal quantity of glycerine and\r\nadding one or two drops of oil of anise, cinnamon, or wintergreen.\r\n\r\nBUTTERNUT (_Juglans Cinerea_). The bark is the part used. Butternut is a\r\nmild cathartic, which resembles rhubarb in its property of evacuating\r\nthe bowels without irritating the alimentary canal. _Dose_--Of the\r\nextract, as a cathartic, five to ten grains; of the fluid extract,\r\none-half to one teaspoonful; of the concentrated principle, Juglandin,\r\none to three grains. As a laxative, one-half of these quantities is\r\nsufficient.\r\n\r\nALOES (_Aloe_) The gum is used. This cathartic acts upon the lower part\r\nof the bowels and sometimes causes piles; though some late authors claim\r\nthat in small doses it is a valuable remedy for piles. _Dose_--In powder\r\nor pill, three to ten grains; as a laxative, one to three grains.\r\n\r\nEPSOM SALTS (_Magnesia Sulphas_). Its common name is \"Salts.\" Much used\r\nin domestic practice. _Dose_--One-fourth to one-half ounce.\r\n\r\nDR. PIERCE'S PLEASANT PELLETS, being entirely vegetable in their\r\ncomposition, operate without disturbance to the system, diet, or\r\noccupation. Put up in glass vials. Always fresh and reliable. As _a\r\nlaxative, alterative,_ or gently acting but searching _cathartic_, these\r\nlittle Pellets give the most perfect satisfaction. Sick Headache,\r\nBilious Headache, Dizziness, Constipation, Indigestion, Bilious Attacks,\r\nand all derangements of the stomach and bowels, are promptly relieved\r\nand permanently cured by the use of Dr. Pierce's Pleasant Pellets. In\r\nexplanation of the remedial power of these Pellets over so great a\r\nvariety of diseases, it may truthfully be said that their action upon\r\nthe system is universal, not a gland or tissue escaping their sanative\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nEverybody, now and then, needs a gentle laxative to assist nature a\r\nlittle; or, a more searching and cleansing, yet gentle cathartic, to\r\nremove offending matter from the stomach and bowels and tone up and\r\ninvigorate the liver and quicken its tardy action. Thereby the \"Pleasant\r\nPellets\" cure biliousness, sick and bilious headache, costiveness, or\r\nconstipation of the bowels, sour stomach, windy belchings, \"heart-burn,\"\r\npain and distress after eating, and kindred derangements of the liver,\r\nstomach and bowels.\r\n\r\nPersons subject to any of these troubles should never be without a vial\r\nof the \"Pleasant Pellets\" at hand. In proof of their superior excellence\r\nit can be truthfully said that they are always adopted as a household\r\nremedy after the first trial.\r\n\r\nThe \"Pleasant Pellets\" are far more effective in arousing the liver to\r\naction than \"blue pills,\" the old-fashioned compound cathartic pills,\r\ncalomel or other mercurial preparations, and have the further merit of\r\nbeing purely vegetable in their composition and perfectly harmless in\r\nany condition of the system. Furthermore, no particular care is required\r\nwhile using them.\r\n\r\nBeing composed of the choicest, concentrated vegetable extracts, their\r\ncost of production is much more than that of most pills found in the\r\nmarket, yet from forty to forty-four of them are put up in each glass\r\nvial, as sold through druggists, and can be had at the price of the more\r\nordinary and cheaper made pills. Once used, they are always in favor.\r\nTheir secondary effect is to keep the bowels open and regular, not to\r\nfurther constipate, as is the case with other pills. Hence, their great\r\npopularity with sufferers from habitual constipation, piles and their\r\nattendant discomfort and manifold derangements.\r\n\r\nFor all laxative and cathartic purposes the \"Pleasant Pellets\" are\r\ninfinitely superior to all \"mineral waters,\" sediltz powders, \"salts,\"\r\ncastor oil, fruit syrups (so-called), laxative \"teas,\" and the many\r\nother purgative compounds sold in various forms.\r\n\r\nIf people generally, would pay more attention to properly regulating the\r\naction of their bowels, they would have less frequent occasion to call\r\nfor their doctor's services to subdue attacks of dangerous diseases.\r\nHence it is of great importance to know what safe, harmless agent best\r\nserves the purpose of producing the desired action.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIRECTIONS FOR USING DR. PIERCE'S PLEASANT PELLETS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn all cases, the size of dose to be taken must be regulated somewhat by\r\nthe known susceptibility of the individual to the action of laxative and\r\ncathartic medicines. Some persons' bowels are readily acted upon by\r\nsmall doses, while others require more. As a general rule, the smaller\r\ndoses which we recommend, are quite sufficient, and produce the best\r\nresults if persisted in for a reasonable length of time.\r\n\r\nFOR A GENTLE APERIENT, OR LAXATIVE, take one or not more than two and\r\npreferably in the morning, on an empty stomach.\r\n\r\nFOR A GENTLE CATHARTIC, two or three are generally sufficient, if taken\r\nin the morning, on an empty stomach.\r\n\r\nFOR A VERY ACTIVE, SEARCHING CATHARTIC, four to six may be taken in the\r\nmorning, on an empty stomach.\r\n\r\nFOR A CHILD OF TWO TO FOUR YEARS, one-half of a Pellet given in a little\r\nsauce of some kind, or soft candy, will be sufficient for a laxative, or\r\none for a mild cathartic.\r\n\r\nFOR A CHILD OF FOUR TO EIGHT YEARS, one for a laxative or two for a\r\ncathartic will act nicely, if given on an empty stomach.\r\n\r\nAS A DINNER PILL.--To promote digestion and increase the appetite, take\r\nonly one Pellet each day after dinner.\r\n\r\n_To overcome the disagreeable effects of a too hearty meal_, take two\r\nPellets as soon as conscious of having overloaded the stomach.\r\n\r\nIN ALL CHRONIC DISEASES, it is of the utmost importance that the bowels\r\nbe kept _regular_, yet thorough purgation should be avoided, as it tends\r\nto debilitate the system. Small laxative doses of one or at most two\r\nPellets, taken daily and continued for a long time, is the plan that we\r\nwould recommend to produce the best results.\r\n\r\nIN DROPSY, an occasional active cathartic dose of the Pellets of say 4\r\nto 6, taken once in a week or ten days, will do good, if, in the\r\ninterval between these doses, Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery be\r\ntaken to invigorate and regulate the system.\r\n\r\nTO BREAK UP SUDDEN ATTACKS OF COLDS, FEVERS, AND INFLAMMATIONS.--It is\r\nonly in these sudden and severe attacks of _acute_ diseases that we\r\nrecommend the Pellets to be taken in active purgative doses, and in\r\nthese cases _only one_ large or cathartic dose of say 5 or 6 Pellets\r\nshould be taken.\r\n\r\nIn colds, fevers, and inflammatory attacks, warm sweating teas should be\r\ntaken freely, and hot foot baths, or a hot general bath, employed to\r\nassist in equalizing the circulation of the blood and restoring the\r\nequilibrium of the system.\r\n\r\nSUPPRESSED MENSTRUATION.--This combined treatment of an active dose of\r\nPellets, coupled with the use of a hot bath, foot bath, or, better\r\nstill, a hot sitz-bath, will bring on _menstruation_, when suppressed\r\nfrom taking cold. In the latter case the effect will be insured if, in\r\naddition to the use of the Pellets and baths, a full dose of Dr.\r\nPierce's Compound Extract of Smart-Weed, or Water Pepper, be also used.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAUSTICS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Caustics_ are substances which have the power of destroying or\r\ndisorganizing animal structures. By their action they destroy the tissue\r\nto which they are applied, and form a crust, which is thrown off by a\r\nseparation from the parts beneath. Their caustic property may be\r\ndestroyed by dilution with other substances, to such an extent that they\r\nwill only irritate or stimulate, and not destroy. Much care is necessary\r\nin their employment, and it is not expected that the unprofessional\r\nreader will have much to do with them; hence, we have deemed it best not\r\nto give a list of these agents.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUNTER-IRRITANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Counter-irritants_ are substances which produce irritation of the part\r\nto which they are applied, varying in degree from a slight redness to a\r\nblister or pustule. They are applied to the surface with a view of\r\nproducing an irritation to relieve irritation or inflammation in some\r\nother or deeper seated part. They are a class of agents which we very\r\nseldom employ, and, hence, we shall notice only a couple of the most\r\nsimple.\r\n\r\nMUSTARD (_Sinapis_). The flour of mustard, which is best adapted for\r\ndomestic use, is employed in the form of a paste spread on cloth. It\r\ntakes effect in a few moments; the length of time it remains in contact\r\nwith the skin and the strength of the mustard determine the effect\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nHORSE-RADISH (_Cochlearia Armoracia_). The leaves are the parts used.\r\nLet them wilt and bind them on the part affected. They act nearly as\r\nenergetically as mustard.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIAPHORETICS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Diaphoretics_ are medicines which increase perspiration. Those which\r\noccasion profuse sweating are termed _Sudorifics_. The two terms\r\nindicate different degrees of the same operation. They constitute an\r\nimportant element in domestic practice, on account of the salutary\r\neffects which generally follow their action. Their operation is favored\r\nby warmth externally, and warm drinks, when they are not given in hot\r\ninfusion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 127.\r\nPleurisy-root. ]\r\n\r\nPLEURISY-ROOT (_Asclepias Tuberosa_), is also known as White-root, and\r\nButterfly-weed. It is a valuable remedy, well adapted to break up\r\ninflammations and disease of the chest. _Dose_--Of infusion, one to two\r\nounces; of fluid extract, one-fourth to one-half teaspoonful; of the\r\nconcentrated principle, Asclepin, one to three grains.\r\n\r\nSAFFRON (_Crocus Sativus_). Golden Saffron. _Dose_--Of infusion (one\r\ndrachm to a pint of water), one to two ounces.\r\n\r\nSage (_Salvia Officinalis_). The warm infusion drunk freely is a\r\nvaluable, domestic diaphoretic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 128.\r\nVirginia Snake-root. ]\r\n\r\nVIRGINIA SNAKE-ROOT (_Aristolochia Serpentaria_), is an efficient\r\nagent. _Dose_--Of infusion, one to two ounces; of tincture, one-fourth\r\nto one teaspoonful; of fluid extract, one-fourth to one-half\r\nteaspoonful.\r\n\r\nJABORANDI (_Pilocarpus Pinnatus_). Jaborandi increases the flow of\r\nsaliva, causes profuse perspiration, and lowers the temperature of the\r\nbody. In doses of from twenty to sixty drops of the fluid extract,\r\nadministered in a cup of warm water or herb-tea on going to bed, we have\r\nfound it very effectual for breaking up recent colds. We have also found\r\nit valuable in whooping-cough, in doses of from three to ten drops,\r\naccording to the age of the child, given three or four times a day. The\r\nfluid extract may be obtained at almost any drug-store.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 129.\r\nMay-flower. ]\r\n\r\nMAY-WEED (_Maruta Cotula_), is also known as Wild Chamomile, and\r\nDog-fennel. It is not much used, though it is a powerful diaphoretic.\r\n_Dose_--Of infusion, one to two ounces.\r\n\r\nCATNIP (_Nepeta Cataria_). A deservedly popular, domestic remedy, always\r\nacceptable, and certain in its action. The warm infusion is the best\r\nform for its administration. It may be drunk freely.\r\n\r\nGINGER (_Zingiber Officinale_). The hot infusion may be sweetened and\r\ndrunk as freely as the stomach will bear.\r\n\r\nDR. PIERCE'S COMPOUND EXTRACT OF SMART-WEED. This is unsurpassed as a\r\ndiaphoretic agent, and is much more certain in its operation than any\r\nsimple diaphoretic.\r\n\r\n\r\nDILUENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAny fluid which thins the blood or holds medicine in solution is called\r\na diluent. Pure water is the principal agent of this class. It\r\nconstitutes about four-fifths of the weight of the blood, and is the\r\nmost abundant constituent of the bodily tissues. Water is necessary, not\r\nonly for digestion, nutrition, and all functional processes of life, but\r\nit is indispensable as a menstruum for medicinal substances. It is a\r\nnecessary agent in depuration, or the process of purifying the animal\r\neconomy, for it dissolves and holds in solution deleterious matter,\r\nwhich in this state may be expelled from the body. In fevers, water is\r\nnecessary to quench the thirst, promote absorption, and incite the skin\r\nand kidneys to action. Its temperature may be varied according to\r\nrequirements. Diluents are the vehicles for introducing medicine into\r\nthe system. We shall briefly mention some which prove to be very\r\ngrateful to the sick.\r\n\r\nVARIOUS VEGETABLE ACIDS AND JELLIES may be dissolved in water, as apple,\r\ncurrant, quince, grape, or cranberry.\r\n\r\nTHE JUICE OF LEMONS, ORANGES, PINE-APPLES, AND TAMARINDS, is also found\r\nto be refreshing to fever patients.\r\n\r\nSASSAFRAS-PITH, SLIPPERY-ELM BARK, FLAX-SEED, AND GUM ARABIC make good\r\nmucilaginous drinks for soothing irritation of the bowels and other\r\nparts.\r\n\r\nBREWERS' YEAST mixed with water in the proportion of from one-eighth to\r\none-fourth is a stimulant and antiseptic.\r\n\r\nTHE WHITE ASHES OF HICKORY OR MAPLE WOOD dissolved in water make an\r\nexcellent alkaline drink in fevers, or whenever the system seems\r\nsurcharged with acidity.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIURETICS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Diuretics_ are medicines which, by their action on the kidneys,\r\nincrease the flow of urine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 130.\r\nMarsh-mallow. ]\r\n\r\nMARSH-MALLOW (_Althea Officinalis_) is used in irritable conditions of\r\nthe urinary organs. The infusion may be drunk freely.\r\n\r\nGRAVEL-PLANT (_Epigea Repens_), is also known as Water-pink,\r\nTrailing-arbutus, or Gravel-root. _Dose_--Of decoction of the plant, one\r\nto three ounces; of fluid extract, one-fourth to one-half teaspoonful.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 131.\r\nStone-root. ]\r\n\r\nSTONE-ROOT (_Collinsonia Canadensis_), is also known as Knot-root,\r\nHorse-balm, Rich-weed, or Ox-balm. This is a mild diuretic, slow in\r\naction, yet effective in allaying irritation of the\r\n\r\nFOXGLOVE (_Digitalis purpurea_) slows the action of the heart, lowers\r\nthe temperature, and acts indirectly as a diuretic. It is especially\r\nvaluable in the treatment of scarlet fever and in dropsy. _Dose_--Of\r\ninfusion, one-half drachm to one-half ounce; of the fluid extract or\r\nstrong tincture, from two to ten drops. It should be used with caution.\r\nA poultice made of the leaves and placed over the kidneys is an\r\neffectual method of employing the drug.\r\n\r\nQUEEN OF THE MEADOW (_Eupatorium Purpureum_), is also known as\r\nGravel-weed, Gravel-root, or Trumpet-weed. This is a most valuable\r\ndiuretic. _Dose_--Of the infusion, one to three ounces; of fluid\r\nextract, one-fourth to one-half teaspoonful; of the concentrated\r\nprinciple, Eupatorin (_Purpu_), one-half to two grains.\r\n\r\nBUCHU (_Barosma Crenata_). The leaves are used. This agent has been\r\nextensively employed, generally in compounds. _Dose_--Of infusion,\r\n(steeped for two hours or more) one to two ounces; of fluid extract, the\r\nsame; of the concentrated principle, Barosmin, one to three grains.\r\n\r\nPIPSISSEWA (_Chimaphila Umbellata_), or Prince's Pine. This is a tonic\r\nto the kidneys, as well as a diuretic and alterative, and is a mild, but\r\nvery efficient remedy. _Dose_--Of decoction, one ounce from four to six\r\ntimes a day; of fluid extract, one-fourth to one-half teaspoonful; of\r\nthe concentrated principle, Chimaphilin, one to two grains.\r\n\r\nWATER-MELON SEEDS (_Cucurbita Citrullus_). _Dose_--Of infusion, the\r\npatient may drink freely until the desired effect is secured.\r\n\r\nPUMPKIN SEEDS (_Cucurbita Pepo_). They are mild, unirritating, yet\r\neffective diuretics. An infusion of these may be drunk freely.\r\n\r\nSWEET SPIRIT OF NITRE (_Spiritus Ætheris Nitros_), is diuretic and\r\nanodyne. _Dose_--One-fourth to one-half teaspoonful, diluted in water,\r\nevery two or three hours.\r\n\r\nSALTPETRE (_Potassæ Nitras_). _Dose_--Powdered, five to ten grains.\r\n\r\nACETATE OF POTASH (_Potassæ Acetas_). _Dose_--Ten to fifteen grains,\r\nlargely diluted in water. It is more frequently used for this purpose\r\nthan the nitrate. It is a most valuable diuretic.\r\n\r\n\r\nEMETICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are medicines which cause vomiting and evacuation of the stomach.\r\nSome of the agents of this class, termed irritant emetics, produce\r\nvomiting by a local action on the stomach, and do not affect this organ\r\nwhen introduced elsewhere. Others, which may be termed systemic emetics,\r\nproduce their effects through the nervous system, and, therefore, must\r\nbe absorbed into the circulation before they can produce vomiting. In\r\ncases of poisoning, it is desirable to empty the stomach as quickly as\r\npossible, hence irritant emetics should be employed, for they act more\r\nspeedily. Draughts of warm water favor the action of emetics.\r\n\r\nMUSTARD (_Sinapis_) acts promptly and efficiently as an emetic, and may\r\nbe employed in poisoning. _Dose_--From one to two teaspoonfuls of\r\npowdered mustard, stirred up in a glass of tepid water. It should be\r\nquickly swallowed and diluents freely administered.\r\n\r\nSULPHATE OF COPPER (_Cupri Sulphas_) is a prompt, irritant emetic. It\r\nshould be given in doses of ten grains dissolved in half a glass of\r\nwater, and its action assisted by the free use of diluents.\r\n\r\nSULPHATE OF ZINC (_Zinci Sulphas_) is similar in its effects to sulphate\r\nof copper, but less powerful, and may be taken in the same manner, and\r\nthe dose repeated if necessary in fifteen minutes.\r\n\r\nYELLOW SUBSULPHATE OF MERCURY (_Hydrargyri Sulphas flava_), commonly\r\nknown as _Turpeth Mineral,_ is an efficient and most desirable emetic in\r\nmembranous croup. It is an active poison, but, as it is quickly thrown\r\nup with the contents of the stomach, there is no danger from its\r\nadministration. _Dose_--It should be given to a child in doses of from\r\nthree to five grains, in the form of powder, rubbed up with sugar of\r\nmilk.\r\n\r\nIPECAC (_Cephælis Ipecacuanha)._In large doses Ipecac is a systemic\r\nemetic. In small doses, it exerts a specific influence upon the mucous\r\nmembranes, relieves nausea and irritation, and subdues inflammation. In\r\ncholera infantum it is an invaluable remedy, if given in very small\r\ndoses. By allaying irritation of the stomach and restoring tone and\r\nfunctional activity to it and the bowels, it gradually checks the\r\ndischarges and brings about a healthy condition. It is also valuable in\r\ndysentery, and is borne in large doses. As an emetic the dose is, of\r\npowder, five to ten grains in warm water; of fluid extract, ten to\r\ntwenty drops.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 132.\r\nLobelia. ]\r\n\r\nLOBELIA (_Lobelia Inflata_), sometimes known as Indian Tobacco, or\r\nEmetic-weed. The herb and seeds are used. This is a powerful, systemic\r\nemetic, but very depressing. _Dose_--Of the powdered leaves, fifteen to\r\ntwenty grains; of the infusion, one to three ounces; of the fluid\r\nextract, ten to fifteen drops.\r\n\r\nBONESET (_Eupatorium Perfoliatum)._ _Dose_--Of the warm infusion or\r\ndecoction, two to three ounces; of the fluid extract, one teaspoonful in\r\nhot water: of the concentrated principle, Eupatorin, two to five grains.\r\n\r\n\r\nEMMENAGOGUES.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmmenagogue is a term applied to a class of medicines which have the\r\npower of favoring the discharge of the menses. We shall mention only a\r\nfew of those which are best adapted to domestic use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 133.\r\nPennyroyal. ]\r\n\r\nPENNYROYAL (_Hedeoma Pulegioides)._ Pennyroyal, used freely in the form\r\nof a warm infusion, promotes perspiration and excites the menstrual\r\ndischarge when recently checked. A large draught of the infusion should\r\nbe taken at bed-time. The feet should be bathed in warm water previous\r\nto taking the infusion.\r\n\r\nBLACK COHOSH (_Cimicifuga Racemosa)._ Black Cohosh, known also as Black\r\nSnake-root, is an effective remedy in uterine difficulties. _Dose_--Of\r\nthe tincture, twenty drops; of the fluid extract, ten drops.\r\n\r\nTANSY (_Tanacetum Vulgare)._ Tansy is beneficial in suppressed\r\nmenstruation. _Dose_--Of the infusion, from one to four fluid ounces.\r\n\r\nERGOT (_Secede Cornutum_) in very small doses acts as an emmenagogue,\r\nand in large doses it checks hemorrhage. The dose as an emmenagogue, of\r\nthe fluid extract, is from two to five drops, and to arrest hemorrhage,\r\nfrom half a drachm to two drachms, repeated in from one to three hours.\r\n\r\nLIFE-ROOT (_Senecio Gracilis._) Life-root exerts a peculiar influence\r\nupon the female reproductive organs, and for this reason has received\r\nthe name of Female Regulator It is very efficacious in promoting the\r\nmenstrual flow, and is a valuable agent in the treatment of uterine\r\ndiseases. _Dose_--Of the decoction, four fluid ounces three or four\r\ntimes a day; of the fluid extract, from one-fourth to one-half\r\nteaspoonful.\r\n\r\nMOTHERWORT (_Leonurus Cardiaca_). Motherwort is usually given in warm\r\ninfusion, in suppression of the menses from cold. _Dose_--Of the\r\ndecoction, from two to three fluid ounces every one or two hours.\r\n\r\nDR. PIERCE'S FAVORITE PRESCRIPTION is an efficient remedy in cases\r\nrequiring a medicine to regulate the menstrual function. Full directions\r\naccompany every bottle.\r\n\r\nDR. PIERCE'S COMPOUND EXTRACT OF SMART-WEED is an excellent emmenagogue.\r\nDr. Eberle, a very celebrated medical writer, and author of a work on\r\nmedicine which is very popular with the profession, says that he has\r\nused the \"Extract of Smart-weed\" in twenty cases of amenorrhea\r\n(suppressed menstruation), and affirms \"with no other remedy or mode of\r\ntreatment have I been so successful as with this.\" Full directions\r\naccompany every bottle. It is sold by all druggists.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPECTORANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpectorants are medicines which modify the character of the secretions\r\nof the bronchial tubes, and promote their discharge. Most of the agents\r\nof this class are depressing in their influence and thus interfere with\r\ndigestion and healthy nutrition. Their application is very limited,\r\nhence we shall dismiss them without further consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nLINIMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nLiniments are medicines designed for external application. The benefits\r\narising from their use depend upon their derivative power, as well as\r\nupon the anodyne properties which many of them possess, rendering them\r\nefficacious for soothing pain. We cannot mention a more valuable agent\r\nof this class than\r\n\r\nDR. PIERCE'S COMPOUND EXTRACT OF SMART-WEED. As an external application\r\nthis preparation subdues inflammation and relieves pain. For all wounds,\r\nbruises, sprains, bee-stings, insect and snake-bites, frost-bites,\r\nchilblains, caked breast, swollen glands, rheumatism, and, in short, for\r\nany and all ailments, whether afflicting man or beast, requiring a\r\ndirect external application, either to allay inflammation or soothe\r\npain, the Extract of Smart-weed cannot be excelled.\r\n\r\n\r\nNARCOTICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA narcotic is a remedy which, in _medicinal_ doses, allays morbid\r\nsensibility, relieves pain, and produces sleep; but which, in overdoses,\r\nproduces coma, convulsions, and death. The quantity necessary to produce\r\nthese results varies in different individuals. We shall mention a few of\r\nthose most frequently employed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 134.\r\nHenbane.]\r\n\r\nHENBANE (_Hyoscyamus Niger_). The leaves and seeds are used. Henbane, in\r\nlarge doses, is a powerful narcotic and dangerously poisonous. In\r\nmedicinal doses, it is anodyne and antispasmodic; it allays pain,\r\ninduces sleep, and arrests spasms. _Dose_--Of the fluid extract, five to\r\nten drops; of the solid extract, from one-half to one grain; of the\r\nconcentrated principle, Hyoscyamin, from one-twelfth to one-fourth of a\r\ngrain.\r\n\r\nINDIAN HEMP (_Cannabis Indica_). An East Indian plant. _Dose_--Of the\r\nextract, from one-fourth to one-half grain, of the tincture, from three\r\nto eight drops; of the fluid extract, from two to five drops. The plant\r\nknown as Indian Hemp, growing in this country, possesses very different\r\nqualities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 135.\r\nStramonium. ]\r\n\r\nSTRAMONIUM (_Datura Stramonium_). Stramonium, also known as Thorn-apple,\r\nin large doses is a powerful narcotic poison. In medicinal doses it acts\r\nas an anodyne and antispasmodic\r\n\r\n_Dose_--Of extract of the leaves, from one-half to one grain; of the\r\nfluid extract, from three to six drops.\r\n\r\n\r\nNERVINES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are medicines which act on the nervous system, soothing excitement\r\nand quieting the condition known as \"nervousness.\"\r\n\r\nHOPS (_Humulus Lupulus_). _Dose_--Of infusion, one to three ounces; of\r\nthe fluid extract, one-fourth to one-half teaspoonful of the\r\nconcentrated principle, Humulin, two to three grains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 136.\r\nScull-cap. ]\r\n\r\nSCULL-CAP. (_Scutellaria Lateriolia_). The herb is used. It is also\r\nknown as Mad-dog Weed. This is a valuable remedy. _Dose_--Of infusion,\r\none to two ounces, of the fluid extract, ten to twenty drops; of the\r\nconcentrated principle, _Scutellarin_, one to two grains.\r\n\r\nLADY'S SLIPPER (_Cypripedium Pubescens_). The root is used. _Dose_--Of\r\nthe infusion, one-half to one-ounce; of THE fluid extract, one-fourth to\r\none-half teaspoonful; of the concentrated principle, Cypripedin, one to\r\ntwo grains.\r\n\r\nPULSATILLA (_Pulsatilla Nigricans)._ We employ the German tincture,\r\nprepared from the green herb. In many of the distressing nervous\r\ncomplications to which both males and females are subject in certain\r\ndiseases of the generative organs, we have found it very effectual. The\r\ndose is from two to eight drops.\r\n\r\nDR. PIERCE'S FAVORITE PRESCRIPTION. This is a tonic nervine of\r\nunsurpassed efficacy, combined in such a manner, that, while it quiets\r\nnervous irritation, it strengthens the enfeebled nervous system,\r\nrestoring it to healthful vigor. In all diseases involving the female\r\nreproductive organs, with which there is usually associated an irritable\r\ncondition of the nervous system, it is unsurpassed as a remedy. It is\r\nalso a uterine and general tonic of great excellence. It is sold by all\r\ndruggists.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEDATIVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nSedatives are a class of agents which control excitation of the\r\ncirculation, and diminish irritability of the nervous system.\r\n\r\nACONITE (_Aconitum Napellus_), The parts used are the root and leaves.\r\nAconite slows the pulse, diminishes arterial tension, and lowers the\r\ntemperature of the body in fevers. It is an effectual remedy in acute\r\ninflammation of the tonsils and throat, in acute bronchitis, in\r\ninflammation of the lungs, and pleurisy, in the hot stage of\r\nintermittent and remittent fevers, in the eruptive fevers, in fever\r\narising from a cold, and in some forms of neuralgia. Acute suppression\r\nof the menses from a cold, may be relieved by the tincture of aconite in\r\ndrop doses every hour. _Dose_--Of the tincture of the root, from\r\none-half of a drop to two drops, in a spoonful of water, in acute fevers\r\nand inflammations, from one-half drop to one drop should be administered\r\nevery half hour or hour, according to the severity of the symptoms.\r\n\r\nPEACH TREE (_Amygdalus Persica_). Peach tree leaves and bark are\r\nslightly sedative, but the chief use which we have found for these\r\narticles is to control nausea and vomiting arising from irritability of\r\nthe stomach. It also possesses mild, tonic properties. _Dose_--Of\r\ninfusion at the bark of the small twigs or of the leaves, from two to\r\nsix teaspoonfuls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 137.\r\nAmerican Hellebore. ]\r\n\r\nAMERICAN HELLEBORE (_Veratrum Viride_) is also known as White Hellebore,\r\nIndian Poke, or Swamp Hellebore. The root is the part used. It is a most\r\nvaluable agent with which to control the frequent, strong, bounding\r\npulse common to many febrile and inflammatory diseases. When the pulse\r\nis hard, incompressible, and bounding, this remedy is more effectual\r\nthan aconite. _Dose_--Of the tincture and fluid extract, from one to two\r\ndrops, repeated every half hour to two hours, according to the severity\r\nof the symptoms. This remedy should be given in very small doses,\r\nfrequently repeated, if we would secure its best effects. Our favorite\r\nmode of administering both veratrum and aconite is to add ten drops of\r\nthe tincture to ten or fifteen teaspoonfuls of water, of which one\r\nteaspoonful may be administered every hour.\r\n\r\nYELLOW JESSAMINE (_Gelseminum Sempervirens_). The root is the part used.\r\nThrough its controlling effect over the sympathetic nervous system, this\r\nagent exerts a marked influence in controlling morbid excitability of\r\nthe circulatory organs. It allays irritation, and determination of blood\r\nto the brain, indicated by flushed face, contracted pupils,\r\nirritability, and restlessness, a frequent condition in diseases\r\nincident to childhood. Its concentrated principle, Gelsemin, is an\r\nefficient remedy in bloody-flux or dysentery. It should be administered\r\nin very small doses to secure the best results. Only one-sixteenth to\r\none-eighth of a grain is required, repeated every two hours. It should\r\nbe triturated with sugar of milk or with common white sugar, in the\r\nproportion of one grain to ten of sugar. _Dose_--Of tincture, from five\r\nto fifteen drops; of fluid extract, three to six drops; of Gelsemin, as\r\na sedative, one-fourth to one-half grain.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTIMULANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nStimulants are medicines which have the power of increasing the vital\r\nactivity of the body. Some have a very transient action, while others\r\nare more permanent in effect.\r\n\r\nCAYENNE PEPPER (_Capsicum Annuum_). Cayenne Pepper is a powerful\r\nstimulant. _Dose_--Of the powder, from one to six grains, administered\r\nin milk; of the tincture, from five to ten drops, largely diluted in\r\nmilk or water.\r\n\r\nBLACK PEPPER (_Piper Nigrum_). Black Pepper is a warm, carminative\r\nstimulant. _Dose_--From five to fifteen grains; of the fluid extract,\r\nfrom ten to fifteen drops.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 138.\r\nPrickly-ash. ]\r\n\r\nPRICKLY-ASH (_Xanthoxylum Fraxineum)._ Prickly-ash bark is a stimulant\r\nand tonic. The parts used are the bark and leaves. _Dose_--Of the fluid\r\nextract, from five to fifteen drops; of the tincture, ten to twenty\r\ndrops; of the active principle, Xanthoxylin, one to two grains.\r\n\r\nALCOHOL is a powerful stimulant. It is never used in its pure state in\r\nmedicine, but when diluted forms a useful remedy in many diseases. It is\r\ngenerally employed in the form of whiskey, gin, rum, brandy, and wine.\r\n\r\nAMMONIA is an excellent stimulant. _Dose_--Of the carbonate, from three\r\nto five grains; of the sesquicarbonate, from five to ten grains; this is\r\nthe same as the carbonate, which has been exposed to the air and slacked\r\n(powdered hartshorn); of the aromatic spirit, from one-half to one\r\nteaspoonful. The Aqua Ammonia and Liquor Ammonia are of such variable\r\nstrength that they are seldom employed internally, but may be applied\r\nexternally and taken by inhalation.\r\n\r\nDR. PIERCE'S COMPOUND EXTRACT OF SMART-WEED. This quickly diffusible\r\nstimulant and genial anodyne we have spoken of under the head of\r\nAnodynes. But its medicinal properties equally entitle it to a place and\r\nmention under the class of stimulants. As a stimulant it spurs the\r\nnervous system and arouses the circulatory forces. Congestion of the\r\nlungs, liver, bowels, or uterus, embarrasses the functions of these\r\norgans. Frequently this congestive difficulty may be entirely obviated,\r\nand the circulation of the blood restored to the surface of the body, by\r\nthe administration of a few doses of this pleasant remedy. Thus it often\r\nacts like magic in giving relief, promoting the circulation, and\r\nrestoring the organs to their accustomed functional activity. Full\r\ndirections accompany every bottle.\r\n\r\n\r\nTONICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTonics are remedies which moderately exalt the energies of all parts of\r\nthe body, without causing any deviation of healthy function. While\r\nstimulants are transient in their influence, tonics are comparatively\r\npermanent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 139.\r\nWhite Poplar. ]\r\n\r\nWHITE POPLAR (_Liriodendron Tulipfera_), called also American Poplar, or\r\nWhite Wood. The part used is the inner bark. This is a mild but valuable\r\ntonic for domestic use. _Dose_--Of the infusion, from one-half to one\r\nounce; of tincture, from one to two teaspoonfuls.\r\n\r\nCHAMOMILE (_Anthemis Nobilis_). The part used is the flowers. This is a\r\nmild, unirritating tonic. _Dose_--Of infusion (one-fourth ounce of\r\nflowers to a pint of water) one-half to one ounce.\r\n\r\nGENTIAN (_Gentiana Lutead_). The root is the part used. This is a\r\nfavorite domestic tonic in many localities. _Dose_--Of powdered root,\r\nfive to ten grains; of the tincture, ten to twenty drops; of the fluid\r\nextract, five to ten drops, four or five times a day.\r\n\r\nNUX VOMICA (_Strychnos Nux Vomica_), or Dog Button. This is a powerful\r\ntonic. It increases innervation and is particularly valuable in cases\r\nmarked by feeble circulation and general impairment of muscular power.\r\nIn overdoses it is poisonous, and hence must be employed with much\r\ncaution. _Dose_--Of the tincture, three to five drops; of the fluid\r\nextract, ONE TO THREE DROPS.\r\n\r\nWILLOW (_Salix Alba_). Willow is a tonic and an astringent. _Dose_--Of\r\nthe decoction, from one to two fluid ounces; of the concentrated\r\nprinciple, Salicin, from two to four grains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 140.\r\nDogwood.]\r\n\r\nDOGWOOD (_Cornus Florida_). Dogwood, also known Boxwood, is tonic,\r\nastringent, and slightly stimulant. _Dose_--Of the solid extract, from\r\nthree to five grains; of the infusion, from one to two ounces; of the\r\nfluid extract, from ten to twenty drops.\r\n\r\nWAFER-ASH (_Ptelea Trifoliata_), also called Swamp Dogwood. The bark is\r\nused. This is a pure, unirritating tonic. _Dose_--Of tincture, one-half\r\nto one teaspoonful; of fluid extract ten to twenty drops; of the\r\ninfusion, one to two fluid ounces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 141.\r\nGolden Seal. ]\r\n\r\nGOLDEN SEAL (_Hydrastis Canadensis_). Golden Seal is a powerful and most\r\nvaluable tonic. It is a valuable local remedy when used as a general\r\ninjection in leucorrhea. _Dose_--Of the powder, from ten to thirty\r\ngrains; of the tincture, from one-half to one fluid drachm; of the fluid\r\nextract, from ten to twenty drops; of the concentrated principle,\r\nHydrastin, from two to three grains; of the muriate of hydrastia, from\r\none-half to one grain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 142.\r\nAmerican Colombo. ]\r\n\r\nAMERICAN COLOMBO (_Frasera Carolinensis_). American Colombo is a simple\r\ntonic. _Dose_--Of the powdered root, from ten to fifteen grains; of the\r\ninfusion one-half to one fluid ounce, three or four times a day; of the\r\nactive principle, Fraserin, one to three grains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 143.\r\nGold Thread. ]\r\n\r\nGOLD THREAD (_Coptis Trifolia_). Gold Thread is a pure and powerful,\r\nbitter tonic, and is also efficacious as a wash for sore mouth or as a\r\ngargle. _Dose_--Of the decoction, from two to six fluid drachms; of the\r\ntincture, from one-half to two teaspoonfuls; of fluid extract, from ten\r\nto twenty drops.\r\n\r\nIRON (_Ferrum_). Different preparations of iron are frequently\r\nprescribed by physicians. They are particularly valuable in anæmic\r\nconditions of the system. The following are a few of the preparations of\r\nthis metal most generally used:\r\n\r\nIRON BY HYDROGEN (_Ferri Redactum_). _Dose_--One to two grains.\r\n\r\nCARBONATE OF IRON (_Ferri Carbonas_). _Dose_--One to three grains.\r\n\r\nCITRATE OF IRON (_Ferri Citras_). _Dose_--One to three grains.\r\n\r\nPYROPHOSPHATE OF IRON (_Ferri Pyrophosphas_). _Dose_--One to three\r\ngrains.\r\n\r\nTINCTURE OF MURIATE OF IRON (_Tinctura Ferri Chloridi)._ _Dose_--Three\r\nto twenty drops.\r\n\r\nDR. PIERCE'S FAVORITE PRESCRIPTION. The Favorite Prescription, in\r\naddition to those properties already described, likewise combines tonic\r\nproperties. In consequence of the never ceasing activities of the bodily\r\norgans, the system requires support, something to permanently exalt its\r\nactions. In all cases of debility, the Favorite Prescription\r\ntranquilizes the nerves, tones up the organs and increases their vigor,\r\nand strengthens the system. Directions for use accompany every bottle.\r\n\r\nDR. PIERCE'S GOLDEN MEDICAL DISCOVERY. In addition to the alterative\r\nproperties combined in this compound, it possesses important tonic\r\nqualities. While the Favorite Prescription exerts a tonic influence upon\r\nthe digestive and nutritive functions, the Golden Medical Discovery acts\r\nupon the excretory glands. Besides, it tends to retard unusual waste and\r\nexpenditure. This latter remedy tones, sustains, and, at the same time\r\nregulates the functions. While increasing the discharge of noxious\r\nelements accumulated in the system, it promptly arrests the wastes\r\narising from debility, and the unusual breaking down of the cells\r\nincident to quick decline. It stimulates the liver to secrete, changes\r\nthe sallow complexion, and transforms the listless invalid into a\r\nvigorous and healthy being. At the same time, it checks the rapid\r\ndisorganization of the tissues and their putrescent change, while it\r\nsustains the vital processes. It is, therefore, and indispensable remedy\r\nin the treatment of many diseases.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nBATHS AND MOTION AS REMEDIAL AGENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe remedial effects of bathing are generally underrated. This want of\r\nappreciation is more often due to the improper manner in which it is\r\nperformed than to an insufficiency of curative virtues. The term\r\n_bathing_ not only implies a cleaning of the body or certain portions of\r\nit, but also the application of water in such a manner as to influence\r\nthe nervous system, and regulate the functions of the secretory organs.\r\nCleanliness, while it preserves health and promotes recovery, has\r\nreference only to the hygienic influences of water and not to its\r\ncurative effects. There are several kinds of baths, the names of which\r\nindicate their character, manner of application, or the part of the body\r\nto which they are applied. Among others, we have Cold, Cool, Temperate,\r\nTepid, Warm, Hot, Hot Air, Russian, Turkish, Vapor, Electric, Sea,\r\nShower, Sponge, Douche, Foot, Sitz, Head, Medicated, Alkaline, Acid,\r\nIodine, and Sulphur Baths. Temperature influences the properties of any\r\nbath; thus the sponge, sitz, and alkaline baths may be employed warm or\r\ncold, according to the effect desired.\r\n\r\nTHE COLD BATH, used at a temperature of from 40° to 60° Fahr., is\r\npowerfully sedative, and is employed for its tonic effects. If the vital\r\npowers are low, or the individual remains in it too long (two or three\r\nminutes should be the limit), the reaction is slow and its effects\r\ninjurious. While it is highly invigorating to robust persons, those who\r\nhave a low standard of vitality should be cautions in its employment. A\r\nlocal bath may be followed by beneficial results, when a general bath\r\nwould be inadmissible. For these reasons we advise the general use of\r\nthe\r\n\r\nCOOL BATH, at a temperature of from 60° to 75° Fahr. If, in any\r\ninstance, the _reaction_ is _slow_, we recommend the\r\n\r\nTEMPERATE BATH, at a temperature of from 75° to 80° Fahr. The time of\r\nremaining in the bath should be regulated by the strength of the\r\ninvalid. As a rule, it should not exceed three _minutes_, and the colder\r\nthe water the less time should the patient be immersed. Immediately\r\nafter emerging from any bath, the body should be thoroughly dried and\r\nrubbed with a moderately coarse towel until a glow is experienced and\r\nreaction is fully established. The attempt to toughen children by\r\nexposing them to low temperatures of either air or water, cannot be too\r\nemphatically condemned. This caution, however, does not apply to the\r\nemployment of moderately cool water for ablutions. The cold or cool bath\r\nshould be taken in the early part of the day, but _never during\r\ndigestion_. Whenever reaction does not follow bathing, artificial means\r\nmust be resorted to, as stimulating drinks, dry warmth, or exercise.\r\n\r\nTHE TEPID BATH, the temperature of which is from 85° to 92° Fahr., is\r\ngenerally used for cleansing the body. It is prescribed in fevers and\r\ninflammatory affections for its cooling effects. It is usually medicated\r\nwith some acid or alkali. The latter unites with the oily secretion of\r\nthe skin and forms a soapy compound easily removed by the water. The\r\ntemperature should be regulated according to the vitality of the\r\npatient; and the bath may be repeated two or three times a day. It\r\nremoves superfluous heat, and keeps the skin in a condition favorable\r\nfor excretion.\r\n\r\nTHE WARM BATH, at a temperature varying from 92° to 98° Fahr., is always\r\nagreeable and refreshing. It equalizes the circulation and softens the\r\nskin, by removing all impurities. It moderates pain and soothes the\r\nwhole system. It does not weaken or debilitate the person, but is in\r\nevery way beneficial. It is an efficient, remedial agent in many chronic\r\ndiseases, convulsions, spasmodic affections of the bowels, rupture,\r\nrheumatism, and derangement of the urino-genital organs. It should be\r\nemployed immediately before going to bed unless urgent symptoms demand\r\nit at other times. It may be medicated or not, as circumstances require,\r\nbut should always be taken in a warm room.\r\n\r\nTHE HOT BATH at a temperature of from 98° to 110° Fahr. is a powerful\r\nstimulant. It excites the nerves, and through them the entire system. It\r\ncauses a sense of heat and a constriction of the secretory organs; but\r\nperspiration, languor, and torpor soon follow. In the sudden\r\nretrocession of cutaneous diseases, it restores the eruptions to the\r\nsurface and gives speedy relief. The hot bath may be applied locally\r\nwhen circumstances require.\r\n\r\nTHE RUSSIAN BATH consists in the application of hot vapor, at a\r\ntemperature varying from 112° to 200° Fahr. The patient is first\r\nsubjected to a moderately warm temperature, which is gradually increased\r\nas he becomes inured to it, the head being surrounded with cloths wet in\r\ncold water. Upon emerging from it, the bather is plunged into cold water\r\nor receives a cool, shower bath. In rheumatic and cutaneous diseases,\r\nchronic inflammations, and nervous affections, the Russian bath is an\r\neffective remedy.\r\n\r\nTHE TURKISH BATH is a, dry, hot-air bath. The bather passes from one\r\napartment to another, each one being of a higher temperature than the\r\npreceding. He undergoes a thorough shampooing, and, although the person\r\nmay be scrupulously clean, he will be astonished at the amount of effete\r\nmatter removed by this process. The bather then returns through the\r\nvarious apartments, and, upon emerging from that of the lowest\r\ntemperature, he experiences a delightful sensation of vigor and\r\nelasticity.\r\n\r\nAs a hygienic agent, the hot-air bath has been' constantly growing in\r\nfavor. Its value is now recognized by all physicians throughout the\r\nworld. The judicious use of the Turkish bath serves to secure perfect\r\nequalization of the circulation. Glandular activity is increased,\r\nelasticity and power given to the muscles, and a permanent, stimulating\r\nand tonic influence imparted to the system, a condition at once\r\nconducive to the enjoyment and prolongation of life. Dr. Erasmus Wilson,\r\nof England, says, in a paper read before the London Medical Association:\r\n\"The inhabitant of a large city would live as healthy, immured within\r\ncity walls, as amid the fields and meadows of the country. His bath\r\nwould be to him in the place of a country house or horse--it would give\r\nhim air, exercise, freshness, health, and life.\"\r\n\r\n\"The bath that cleanses the inward as well as the outward man; that is\r\napplicable to every age; that is adapted to make health healthier, and\r\nalleviate disease, whatever its stage or severity, deserves to be\r\nadopted as a national institution, and merits the advocacy of all\r\nmedical men; of those whose especial duty it is to teach how health may\r\nbe preserved, and how disease may be averted.\"\r\n\r\nThe hot, _dry_ atmosphere of the Turkish bath promotes rapid evaporation\r\nfrom the surface of the body, and it is well known that rapid\r\nevaporation from the surface is a cooling process. A person's finger may\r\nbe frozen in one minute's time, by throwing upon it a constant, fine\r\nspray of rhigolene or sulphuric ether. The rapid evaporation of the\r\nlight fluid congeals the liquids of the tissues and a film of ice is\r\nrapidly formed upon the part. In a less intense degree the same cooling\r\nprocess is carried on over the whole surface of a person, when in the\r\nhot room, or _sudatorium_, of the Turkish bath. The evaporation from the\r\nsurface is so rapid that one can hardly appreciate the profuseness of\r\nthe perspiration going on. The evaporation from the surface so rapidly\r\ncarries off the heat from the body that one finds himself able, with\r\nlittle or no inconvenience, to remain in a room heated to from 180° to\r\n200° or even 220° Fahr.\r\n\r\nAs a hygienic measure to be regularly or occasionally employed by\r\npersons in fair health, the Turkish or hot dry-air bath is far superior\r\nto the Russian or vapor-bath. (1.) It produces more profuse\r\nperspiration, and is therefore more depurating, or cleansing, in its\r\neffects. (2.) It does not relax the system, but rather produces a tonic\r\neffect, and fewer precautions are, therefore, necessary to guard against\r\ntaking cold after employing it. (3.) The Turkish bath can be better\r\nventilated than the Russian. While the air is heated to a high\r\ntemperature, it can be readily kept pure by constant changes. In the\r\nTurkish hot-rooms, or _sudatorium_, of the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical\r\nInstitute, provision is made for bringing underneath the floors a\r\ncurrent of fresh air from without. This column of fresh air is carried\r\nunder the centre of each room where it escapes from the conductor, is\r\nwarmed, and rises into the room, from which extraction of air is\r\nconstantly going on through registers opening into tubes, communicating\r\nwith large ventilated shafts which are kept hot, summer and winter, to\r\ninsure a draught through them. In this manner, thorough ventilation of\r\nour Turkish hot-rooms is insured.\r\n\r\nThe Turkish bath not only combines a most agreeable luxury with a\r\ndecidedly invigorating and tonic influence, but also, by its stimulating\r\npower, induces proper glandular and cellular activity, producing a\r\nhealthy condition.\r\n\r\nSallowness, tan, and freckles, the result of local or general increase\r\nof the pigment granules of the skin, soon disappear under the\r\nstimulating influence and regular use of the Turkish bath, which causes\r\nrapid development of new and transparent cells. The colored granules are\r\nthus gradually replaced and the skin assumes a beautiful clearness and\r\npurity of appearance, which transcends immeasurably the unhealthy hue\r\nthat follows the frequent employment of the various cosmetics.\r\n\r\nThe value of an agent which thus improves the general health, insures\r\nimmunity from coughs, colds, and other diseases, and at the same time\r\nproduces a healthy and permanent beauty of complexion, is at once\r\napparent. The purity of person, perfect circulation, increase of healthy\r\nnutrition and glandular activity produced by the Turkish bath, serve to\r\nmake it of the most lasting utility.\r\n\r\nThe eminent Dr. Madden has said, and his experience is confirmed by\r\nevery regular patron of the bath, that, \"Wherever the Turkish bath was a\r\nnational institution the hair of the women was peculiarly luxurious and\r\nbeautiful. I can vouch for it that the use of the bath rendered the\r\ncomplexion more delicate and brilliant; that the eyes became clearer and\r\nbrighter; all the personal charms were enhanced. I can recommend no\r\nhygienic measure more beneficial or effectual in preserving the health\r\nand an attractive personal appearance.\"\r\n\r\nPimples, blotches, eruptions, and other disfigurations of the skin are\r\nremoved by the frequent use of the Turkish bath, leaving the integument\r\nsmooth and soft.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 144.\r\nFirst Hot-room of the Turkish Bath. ]\r\n\r\nHOW THE TURKISH BATH IS ADMINISTERED AT THE INVALID'S HOTEL AND SURGICAL\r\nINSTITUTE. The hot-rooms, of which there are two, are exactly similar in\r\nevery respect except as regards temperature. The first room has a\r\ntemperature of from 110° to 120° Fahr. The bather is supplied by the\r\nattendant every few minutes with copious draughts of cool water.\r\nGradually the relaxing influence of the elevated temperature manifests\r\nitself. The capillaries slowly dilate, the veins enlarge under its\r\ngentle stimulus, and small points of perspiration appear upon the\r\nsurface, which assumes a slight, rosy blush. A delightful calm, a\r\nfeeling of perfect rest and luxurious ease is imparted to the senses.\r\nFrom this room, after an appropriate interval, the bather enters the\r\nsecond room, in which the atmosphere is higher by from 20° to 30°, and\r\nit may be made still higher, its regulation requiring but an instant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 145.\r\nOne of the Shampooing rooms.]\r\n\r\nA thorough sweating occurs while the subject remains in these rooms,\r\nduring a period of from ten to forty minutes. The secretions of the\r\nskin, at first impure and loaded with the _débris_ of dead cells and\r\nextraneous matter, gradually become purer, and clearer, until, finally,\r\nall trace of color disappears and the pearly drops of sweat come full\r\nand free. Soon the attendant appears and leads the way to the\r\nshampooing-room, where, lying upon a warm marble slab, _massage_ is\r\napplied most thoroughly to every portion of the body.\r\n\r\nBy the _massage_, shampooing, or rubbing, the superficial veins are\r\nthoroughly emptied of their contents, the muscles are given elasticity\r\nand tone, and glandular activity is promoted. Innumerable dead\r\nepithelial cells, together with other impurities, are rolled off in\r\nflakes under the skillful manipulation of the attendant.\r\n\r\nAfter a thorough shampooing, the shower bath is applied, to secure a\r\ncontraction of the capillaries and a diminution of the perspiration.\r\n\r\nTHE SPIRIT VAPOR-BATH is very effective when employed in the earlier\r\nstages of acute, febrile, inflammatory, and painful diseases. In many\r\nforms of chronic diseases the administration of a spirit vapor-bath once\r\nin from three to fifteen days, is a valuable adjunct to the treatment of\r\nthese affections. It exerts an exceedingly beneficial influence upon the\r\nentire system, and, when habitually employed, may ward off disease.\r\n\r\nThe body should be moistened with an alkaline solution before the\r\nadministration of a spirit vapor-bath. After the perspiration which it\r\noccasions has subsided, which will usually be in from three to four\r\nhours, sponge the body with a mixture of the following ingredients:\r\nwater, three gills; alcohol, one gill; salt, one teaspoonful. By this\r\nmethod the patient experiences none of the unpleasant effects which\r\ngenerally follow the employment of diaphoretics. Various kinds of\r\napparatus have been devised to facilitate the application of the spirit\r\nvapor-baths. Most of them are cumbersome and expensive, and,\r\nconsequently, are seldom used except in hospitals or sanitariums.\r\n\r\nThe following method described by Dr. J. King, may be advantageously\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\n\"The patient is undressed, ready for getting into bed, having removed\r\nthe clothing worn through the day and put on a night shirt or other\r\nclothing to be worn while sweating, and during the night, if the bath is\r\ntaken at bed-time. He is then seated on a high Windsor or\r\nwooden-bottomed chair, or instead thereof, a bench or board may be\r\nplaced on a common open-bottomed chair, care being taken that the bottom\r\nis so covered that the flame will not burn him. After seating himself, a\r\nlarge coverlet or blanket is thrown around him from behind, covering the\r\nback of his head and body, as well as the chair, and another must be\r\npassed around him in front, which last is to be pinned at the neck,\r\nloosely, so that he can raise it and cover his face, or remove it down\r\nfrom the face from time to time as occasion demands during the operation\r\nof the bath. The blankets must reach down to the floor, and cover each\r\nother at the side, so as to retain the vapor. This having been done, a\r\nsaucer or tin vessel, into which is put one or two tablespoonfuls of\r\nwhiskey, brandy, alcohol, or any liquor that will burn, is then placed\r\nupon the floor, directly under the centre of the bottom of the chair,\r\nraising a part of the blanket from behind to place it there; then light\r\na piece of paper, apply the flame to the liquor, and as soon as it\r\nkindles let down the part of the blanket which has been raised, and\r\nallow the liquor to burn until it is consumed, watching it from time to\r\ntime to see that the blankets are not burned. As soon as consumed, put\r\nmore liquor into the saucer, about as much as before, and again set it\r\non fire, being careful to put no liquor into the saucer while the flame\r\nexists, as there would be danger of setting fire to the blanket, and\r\nproducing injury to the patient. Continue this until the patient\r\nperspires freely, which, in a majority of cases, will be in five or ten\r\nminutes.\"\r\n\r\n\"If, during the operation the patient feels faint or thirsty, cold water\r\nmust be sprinkled or dashed in his face, or he may drink one or two\r\nswallows of it,--and in some cases the head may be bathed with cold\r\nwater. As soon as free perspiration is produced, wrap the blankets\r\naround him, place him in bed, and cover him up warm, giving him about a\r\npint of either some good store tea, ginger, or some diaphoretic herb tea\r\nto drink, as warm as he can take it. After two or three hours, remove\r\nthe covering, piece by piece, at intervals of twenty or twenty-five\r\nminutes each, that he may gradually cease perspiring.\"\r\n\r\nThe above method may be improved by using an ordinary hoop skirt, ten to\r\ntwelve inches below the bottom of which is suspended a larger and\r\nstronger hoop. The upper and smaller hoops should rest upon the\r\npatient's shoulders. A woolen blanket, large enough to reach and rest\r\nupon the floor, and envelop the whole person, is thrown over the hoops.\r\nUnless the bath is employed to diminish the quantity of fluids in the\r\nbody (as in dropsy), the patient may drink some simple, diaphoretic\r\ninfusion, to hasten or facilitate perspiration. When he perspires\r\nfreely, small quantities of cold water may be frequently given. \"There\r\nis little or no danger of taking cold after this process, if ordinary\r\nprecaution is observed, and it is easy, agreeable, safe, and effectual.\"\r\n\r\n\"Occasionally we will meet with patients, upon whom it is almost\r\nimpossible to produce the slightest moisture, much less perspiration.\r\nThe skin of such persons is generally dry and harsh, communicating an\r\nunpleasant sensation to the touch. In most instances the skin may be\r\nrestored to its normal condition, by adopting the following course: 1st.\r\nAnoint the whole surface of the body and limbs with olive oil every\r\nnight upon retiring to bed. 2nd. Every morning wash the whole surface\r\nwith a warm, weak, alkaline solution, employing considerable friction\r\nwhile drying. 3rd. Every two weeks administer a spirit vapor-bath. A\r\nperseverance in this course for a few months will accomplish the desired\r\nresult.\"\r\n\r\nFrequent reference to spirit vapor-baths will be made by the author of\r\nthis work, in speaking of those diseases in which its employment will\r\nprove beneficial.\r\n\r\nSEA BATHING is an excellent, remedial agent in chronic disorders,\r\nparticularly in those of an atonic character, such as nervous\r\nprostration, dyspepsia, and general debility.\r\n\r\nMuch of the benefit attributed to this mode of bathing is undoubtedly\r\ndue to other influences, such as pure air, exercise, change of scenery,\r\ndiet, and associations which surround the patient during his sojourn at\r\nthe sea-shore.\r\n\r\nAt first, the duration of a sea-bath should not exceed three or five\r\nminutes, but it may be gradually prolonged to fifteen or twenty minutes.\r\nIf the patient is very feeble, one or two baths a week are sufficient,\r\nand the most robust person should never take more than one a day. They\r\nshould always be taken in the earlier portion of the day, before\r\nbreakfast if possible, and _never during digestion_.\r\n\r\nBefore entering this bath, a moderate degree of exercise should always\r\nbe taken, enough to arouse the vital energies, but not to produce\r\nfatigue. Suitably dressed, the patient plunges into the water, in which\r\nhe remains during the prescribed time. Immediately after emerging from\r\nthe bath, the patient should be thoroughly dried and dressed and then\r\nmoderate exercise should be taken to induce reaction. If the reaction is\r\nslow, a mild stimulant may be taken and the duration of the bath must be\r\ndiminished the next time. When sea-bathing is beneficial improvement is\r\nsoon manifested. The blood becomes richer, the whole system is\r\nstrengthened and the functions are performed with more regularity. To\r\nthe rich, sea-bathing is a luxury, but it is a remedy beyond the reach\r\nof the poorer classes unless they live near the sea-shore.\r\n\r\nTHE SHOWER BATH produces a shock to the nervous system by suddenly\r\ncoming in contact with the skin. Numerous streams of cold water fall\r\nupon the neck, shoulders, and body of the patient who stands beneath the\r\nhose or reservoir. When the patient is plethoric, feeble, or nervous, or\r\nwhen some internal organ is diseased, the cold, shower bath should _not_\r\nbe employed. In simple debility unaccompanied by inflammation or\r\nsymptoms of internal congestion, its use proves advantageous. By\r\nmoderating the force of the shower, and substituting tepid water, the\r\nmost delicate persons can endure it and profit thereby. The usual means\r\nfor inducing a good reaction, friction, and exercise, should be\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nTHE DOUCHE BATH consists of a stream of water, dashed or thrown upon the\r\npatient from a moderate height or distance, with considerable force. The\r\nsize, temperature, and force of the stream may be modified to suit the\r\nexigencies of the case. It is locally employed as a remedy for sprains,\r\nweak or stiff joints, old swellings, etc. The cold, douche bath is more\r\npowerful than the shower bath and should be given with the same\r\nprecautions which govern the application of the latter.\r\n\r\nTHE SPONGE BATH admits of extensive employment in both acute and chronic\r\ndiseases, and its simplicity renders it of untold value. It consists in\r\na general or local application of water (medicated or not) at any\r\ndesired temperature. The quantity may be great or small to suit the\r\nrequirements of the case. If it is applied in acute diseases at a\r\ntemperature agreeable to the patient, it is exceedingly grateful and may\r\nbe repeated as often as necessary. It may be rendered alkaline by the\r\naddition of some compound of soda, in the proportion of a teaspoonful to\r\na quart of water. A portion of the body may be bathed at a time, and\r\nquickly dried, thus avoiding any exposure to cold. It removes excessive\r\nanimal heat, relaxes the capillaries, equalizes the circulation, and\r\nproduces comfort, tranquility, and sleep.\r\n\r\nNothing is more conducive to the health and comfort of laboring men in\r\nsummer than a daily bath, and it is a matter of regret that there are so\r\nfew conveniences for the purpose in most homes, especially those in the\r\ncountry. Farmers in particular need bathing facilities, and yet in most\r\ncases they are almost entirely without them. For their benefit we will\r\ndescribe a device which we can recommend to all who want a cheap,\r\nconvenient, and easily managed apparatus for sponge bathing in the\r\nbed-room.\r\n\r\nThe articles required are a piece of rubber-cloth a yard and a quarter\r\nsquare, four slats, two inches wide and three feet long, notched at the\r\nends so as to lock together in the form of a square, and a large sponge.\r\nThe slats are placed upon the floor and the rubber cloth is spread over\r\nthem (there is no need of fastening it to the slats), forming a shallow\r\nsquare vessel a yard wide. In this the bather stands and applies the\r\nwater with a sponge from a basin or bowl on a stand placed conveniently\r\nnear. There need be no danger of wetting the carpet, or spoiling the\r\nfurniture.\r\n\r\nWhen the bath is finished, gather three corners of the rubber cloth in\r\nthe left hand, take the fourth corner in the right in such a way as to\r\nform a spout when lifted or held over the slop-jar or bucket. The water\r\nmay be poured out in a moment, when the cloth should be spread over the\r\nback of a chair to dry, and the slats unlocked and set away in a closet.\r\n\r\nTHE FOOT BATH is frequently employed, as a means of causing diaphoresis,\r\nin colds, attacks of acute diseases, and also to draw the blood from the\r\nhead or some internal organ. It is a powerful auxiliary in the treatment\r\nof those chronic diseases in which inflammation, congestion, and a\r\nfeeble circulation are prominent symptoms. The water should be as hot as\r\nit can be borne and the temperature kept up by additions of hot water.\r\nIt may be made stimulating by the addition of salt, mustard, ginger, or\r\ncayenne pepper.\r\n\r\nTHE SITZ BATH. A tub is so arranged that the patient can sit down in it\r\nwhile bathing. In this manner the lower part of the abdomen, hips, and\r\nupper part of the thighs, are immersed in whatever fluid the bath is\r\ncomposed of. It is applicable in diseases of the pelvic organs, and may\r\nbe hot, warm, cool, cold, or medicated, according to the effect desired.\r\n\r\nThe bath tub should be large enough to permit a thorough rubbing and\r\nkneading of the diseased parts, and the patient may remain in it from\r\nten to thirty minutes. The clothing may be wholly or partially removed,\r\nas agreeable to the individual. A _warm_, sitz bath is an effective,\r\nremedial adjunct in menstrual suppression and in painful menstruation,\r\ngravel, spasmodic and acute inflammatory affections generally. The\r\n_cold_, sitz bath is used as a tonic in cases of relaxed tissues of the\r\npelvis, in debility of the urino-genital organs, in piles, prolapsus of\r\nthe rectum, and in constipation.\r\n\r\nTHE HEAD BATH. A shallow basin contains the fluid for the bath; and the\r\npatient, assuming a recumbent position, immerses a portion of the head,\r\ngenerally the back part. The temperature may be warm, cool, or cold, as\r\ndesired.\r\n\r\nMEDICATED BATHS are infusions of vegetable or other substances in water.\r\nThey are sometimes applied with the sponge, though generally the patient\r\nis immersed. The temperature at which they are usually employed is that\r\nof the tepid bath. The nature and strength of the medication depends\r\nupon the character of the disease for which it is employed.\r\n\r\nTHE ALKALINE BATH is prepared by dissolving half a pound of carbonate of\r\nsoda in sixty gallons of water. It is useful in those diseases in which\r\nthe fluids of the body are abnormally acid, as in rheumatism.\r\n\r\nTHE ACID BATH is prepared by adding two pounds of muriatic or\r\nhydrochloric acid to sixty gallons of water. A much smaller quantity of\r\nthe acid is sometimes used, and in some instances vinegar is\r\nsubstituted.\r\n\r\n_Scott's Acid Bath_ is composed of nitro-muriatic acid (aqua regia) and\r\nwater. It should be prepared in a wooden tub, and a sufficient quantity\r\nof acid used to give the water a sour taste. It is extensively used in\r\nIndia as a remedy for disorders of the liver.\r\n\r\nTHE IODINE BATH is composed of the following ingredients: tincture of\r\niodine, two drachms; iodide of potassium, four drachms; water, forty\r\ngallons. It should be prepared in a wooden tub. It reddens the skin. For\r\nchildren, a much weaker solution must be employed. Its use is generally\r\nrestricted to scrofulous and tubercular affections.\r\n\r\nTHE SULPHUR BATH is prepared by dissolving eight ounces of sulphuret of\r\npotassium and two ounces of dilute sulphuric acid in sixty gallons of\r\nwater. The acid may be omitted.\r\n\r\nA SULPHUR VAPOR-BATH is often employed in cities where the necessary\r\napparatus can be procured. It may be improvised by placing sulphur on a\r\nshovel over hot coals. The patient should be prepared as in the spirit\r\nvapor-bath, and burning sulphur substituted for the liquor. The patient\r\nis then enveloped in the fumes of sulphurous oxide. Heating a mixture of\r\nsulphur and sulphuric acid, produces the same result. If the gas is\r\ninhaled in large quantities it causes irritation of the respiratory\r\npassages, and suffocation. It is therefore necessary that the coverings\r\nshould be securely fastened at the neck, and that the room be one which\r\ncan be quickly filled with pure air This bath is used in cutaneous,\r\nrheumatic, and syphilitic disorders.\r\n\r\nFOMENTATIONS consist of the general or local application of woolen\r\ncloths wrung out of hot water. They should not be so light as to be\r\nineffectual, nor so heavy as to be burdensome. They should not be wet\r\nenough to drip, nor applied so as to expose the body to the surrounding\r\nair. A fresh cloth should be ready for application before the first one\r\nis removed, and the change quickly effected. Fomentations are effectual\r\nin relieving congestion and inflammation.\r\n\r\nTHE WET SHEET PACK. As this remedial appliance will be frequently\r\nrecommended in the pages following, its mode of application is here\r\ndescribed. Take a pail half filled with cold water, gather together one\r\nend of a common cotton sheet, and immerse it, allowing it to remain\r\nwhile preparing the bed, which may be done as follows: remove all the\r\nbed-clothes except a coverlet and the pillows, then spread upon it, in\r\nthe following order, two ordinary comforters, one woolen blanket, one\r\nwoolen sheet, (or two woolen sheets if a woolen blanket is not at hand);\r\nthen wring out one-half or two-thirds of the water from the wet sheet,\r\nspread it smoothly upon the blanket, and the patient being undressed,\r\nplaces himself on the sheet, with his arms extended, while an assistant\r\nwraps him closely and tightly with it, as quickly as possible. Each arm\r\nmay be thus covered by the wet sheet, or may lie outside of it, and be\r\ncovered by wet towels, prepared in the same manner as the sheet. Then\r\nquickly and tightly cover with the blankets and comforters, tucking\r\nsnugly from head to foot. The head should also be covered with a wet\r\ntowel, and a bottle of warm water placed to the feet, or near enough to\r\nkeep them warm.\r\n\r\nAfter the first shock of the chill is over, the pack is very pleasant\r\nand refreshing, and the patient should go to sleep, if possible. The\r\nordinary time for a patient to remain in a pack is about sixty minutes.\r\nThirty or forty minutes is sufficient, if he is in a feeble condition.\r\nNever wring the sheet out of warm water, for one of its principal\r\nbenefits comes from the vigorous reaction induced by its cold\r\ntemperature. After remaining in the pack from thirty to sixty minutes,\r\nallow the patient to stand on his feet, if he is able, and have the\r\nwhole surface of his body bathed. Rub briskly, and dry with towels, or\r\nby throwing over the body a dry sheet and then rubbing him. The dry\r\nsheet retains the bodily warmth and is more comfortable, but interferes\r\nwith the completeness and vigor of the rubbing of the body. Be sure and\r\nestablish full reaction, which may be known by the warmth of the\r\nsurface. Frequently, when the patient is released from the pack, and is\r\nbeing bathed, rolls of scales, scurf, and _skin-debris_ come off, thus\r\ngiving palpable evidence of the utility of the pack in freeing the\r\nmyriads of pores of the skin of effete matter. It is efficient in\r\nfevers, and for breaking up colds, and is a very valuable, remedial\r\nagent in most chronic diseases, assisting in removing causes which\r\ndepress the bodily functions.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOTION IS A REMEDIAL AGENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stability of the planetary system depends upon the converted motion\r\nof its parts. So in the human system, motion is a fundamental principle\r\nwhich underlies every vital process. Health consists in normal,\r\nfunctional activity. The human system is the arena of various kinds of\r\nmotions, both of fluids and of solids, and life and health depend upon\r\nthese physiological movements. There are the movements incident to\r\n_respiration_, the expansion and contraction of the walls of the chest,\r\nbringing the oxygen of the air into contact with the blood as it\r\ncirculates through the lungs. Corresponding with the movements of the\r\nchest are the _motions of the abdominal walls_, which promote the\r\nfunctions of the organs of the abdominal cavity.\r\n\r\nThere are _motions of the heart and arteries_, which urge the blood out\r\nto the extremities and diffuse it through every part of the system, and\r\nalso _motion of the blood in the capillaries_, by which the blood is\r\ncirculated through the tissues, that the latter may be built up from its\r\nnutritive constituents. Then there is the _motion of the vital current_\r\nin the veins returning towards the heart, and urged forward by the\r\nmuscular and pump-like action of the chest and abdominal walls. The\r\nperistaltic _motions of the stomach and bowels_ urge onward digesting\r\nmaterials, exposing them successively to different solvents and aiding\r\nthe absorption of nutritive matter. No less essential to life and health\r\nare numerous other minute operations or _motions_, on which vital power\r\nin all its manifestations of muscular and nervous energy depends. Many\r\nother _motions_ are consequent upon decay, growth, and repair. Oxygen,\r\ncarbonic acid, watery vapors, and other gaseous matter are constantly\r\nbeing exchanged between the system and atmosphere. Then, the human\r\nsystem being a complex, chemical laboratory, there are _motions\r\nconsequent upon chemical action_, constantly going on within it.\r\n\r\n_Muscular motion_, under the direction of the will, is also absolutely\r\nnecessary for the maintenance of good health.\r\n\r\nAnimal heat and muscular and nervous power are dependent upon motions of\r\nthe minutest particles composing the body. The body is composed of fluid\r\nand semi-fluid matter, permitting great freedom of motion. Health\r\nrequires that there shall be _a constant change of place_, an active\r\ntransmission of material to and from vital organs and parts, through the\r\nmedium of blood-vessels, as well as outside such vessels; that is,\r\nmotion of interstitial fluids.\r\n\r\nNATURE'S MODE OF SUSTAINING HEALTH. The act of transforming latent,\r\nnon-vital force which exists pent-up in food, as heat is in coal, into\r\nvital energy, requires the simultaneous elimination from the system of a\r\nlike amount of worn-out matter. Assimilation of nutritive materials is\r\nimpossible, unless a like amount of matter be eliminated from the\r\nsystem. Muscular and nervous energy are dependent upon activities which\r\ncause waste. Not only is this true in a general way, but it is also true\r\nthat the energy produced by the operations of the vital system has a\r\nstrict relation to the wasting products--that _full_ energy is only\r\nattained by _perfected_ waste. Use, waste, and power, then, sustain\r\ndefinite and dependent or corresponding relations, since waste is as\r\nessential to health as is supply.\r\n\r\nWithout waste, disturbance is at once produced in the system similar to\r\nthat resulting from the introduction of foreign matter. These\r\ndisturbances constitute disease. The more obvious effects of lack of\r\nwaste and elimination are mechanical. The circulation is loaded with\r\neffete and useless matter, the vessels being thereby weakened and\r\ndistended, and the circulation retarded. The capillaries become clogged\r\nand vital action is diminished. Local congestions, inflammations,\r\neffusions, morbid growths, and other pathological results follow.\r\n\r\nDeranged or suppressed action characterizes, and, indeed, constitutes\r\nall departures from health which we call disease. Suffering indicates\r\naction, but action which is perverted into wrong channels, or action in\r\none part at the expense of motion in other parts, constituting a\r\ndisturbance in the equilibrium of forces, from which the system suffers.\r\n\r\nVALUE OR MECHANICAL MOVEMENTS AND MANIPULATIONS FOR THE TREATMENT OF\r\nCHRONIC DISEASES. To correct and restore deranged movements, thereby\r\nproducing normal, functional activity of every organ and part of the\r\nsystem, must therefore be the chief object of the physician. All\r\nremedies, of whatever school or nature, imply motion, and depend for\r\ntheir efficacy upon their ability to excite motion in some one or more\r\nelements, organs, or parts of the system.\r\n\r\nWhile we do not wish to detract from the real merits of medicine as a\r\ncurative agent, yet we must admit that the remedial power of motion,\r\ntransmitted either manually or mechanically, is founded upon rational\r\nand physiological principles. All systems of medicine, however much they\r\nmay differ superficially, propose, as the chief end to be attained by\r\nthe administration of medicine, or by other treatment, that _motions_\r\nidentical with physiological activity should be incited or promoted. How\r\nbest to accomplish this result, and with least cost to vitality, is an\r\nimportant consideration. Bearing in mind the conservation of forces,\r\nthat energy or power is as indestructible as matter, that it may be\r\nchanged into other forms but never lost, it is plain that mechanical\r\nforce may be applied to the living system and transformed into vital\r\nenergy; that chemical action, animal heat, and magnetism may represent\r\nin the system the mechanical force transmitted to the body. Keeping in\r\nview the transformable nature of force, and the need that our systems\r\nhave of auxiliary power in different departments, when normal activity\r\nis impaired by disease, we can readily understand how undoubted,\r\ncurative effects result from either the manual or the mechanical\r\nadministration of motion.\r\n\r\nRUBBING is a process universally employed by physicians of every school\r\nfor the relief of a great diversity of distressing symptoms, is\r\ninstinctively resorted to by sympathizers and attendants upon the sick,\r\nand constitutes one of the chief duties of the nurse. Uncivilized people\r\nresort to this process as their principal remedy in all forms of\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty in administering motion as a remedial agent by manual\r\neffort, such as rubbing, kneading, oscillating, flexing, and extending\r\nthe limbs, lies in the impossibility of supplying the _amount,\r\nintensity_, and _variety_ of movement required to make it most\r\neffective. The power of the arm and the strength of the operator are\r\nexhausted before the desired effect is produced. Inventive genius has at\r\nlast overcome the obstacles to the successful and perfect administration\r\nof motion as a curative agent. We have now a series of machines\r\npropelled by mechanical power, by the use of which we rub, knead,\r\nmanipulate, and apply in succession a great variety of movements to all\r\nparts of the body. These machines transmit motion to the body from\r\ninexhaustible sources, never tire, but are ever ready for new, remedial\r\nconquests. The movements administered by their use, _while entirely\r\nunder the control of the patient_, are never disagreeable, and are far\r\nmore rapid and intense than can possibly be given by the hands. By the\r\napplication of short, quick movements of from _twelve to fifteen hundred\r\nvibrations a minute_, deep-seated organs and parts are reached, to which\r\nmotion is transmitted and in which vital energy is thereby generated.\r\nThe hands have not the power, by kneading, manipulating, or rubbing to\r\nimpress the system except in a very mild degree, and deep-seated organs\r\nand parts are scarcely influenced by the comparatively slow movements\r\nthus administered. Among the most important, mechanical inventions\r\ndevised for administering motion as a remedial agent, is one which has\r\nreceived the name of the _manipulator_.\r\n\r\nTHE MANIPULATOR. With this machine motion can be applied to any organ or\r\npart of the system, and intensity of the application regulated to a\r\nnicety. The rapidity of motion necessary to produce active exhilaration\r\nof any part of the body is easily secured by the use of the manipulator,\r\nbut is far beyond the power of the hands. The degree of circulation\r\ngiven to the fluids, both inside and outside of the vessels, and of\r\nenergy imparted to the organs and parts operated upon by the\r\nmanipulator, is also unapproachable by the application of manual power.\r\n\r\nEFFECTS UPON THE CIRCULATION AND NUTRITION. The influence of motion on\r\nthese functions is as follows: The contents of the blood-vessels are\r\nmoved onward by the pressure and motion transmitted by the manipulator,\r\nall backward movement of the blood being prevented by the valves of the\r\nveins and by the propelling power of the heart and arteries. Fluids\r\noutside these vessels pass through their walls, to take the place of the\r\nstagnant blood that has been moved onward. Other blood flows into the\r\npart, and thus active and healthy circulation is induced, and nutritive\r\nmaterial, capable of affording vital support is also brought to refresh\r\nthe local part.\r\n\r\nWe have found mechanical movements especially effectual in paralysis,\r\nneuralgia, sleeplessness, and other nervous affections; in derangements\r\nof the liver, constipation, and dyspepsia; in displacements of the\r\nuterus, and congestion, and inflammation of the pelvic organs.\r\n\r\nFor a complete description of the mechanical movements and the machinery\r\nemployed in the treatment of diseases at the Invalids' Hotel and\r\nSurgical Institute, the reader is referred to the appendix to this work.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nHYGIENIC TREATMENT OF THE SICK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two essentials requisite to the successful treatment of the\r\nsick: (1.) Medical skill; (2.) Good nursing. The former is necessary in\r\norder that the condition of the patient be fully understood, and the\r\nproper means be employed to effect his recovery. The latter is\r\nessential, in order that all influences favoring the production and\r\ndevelopment of disease may be removed, the tendencies to restoration be\r\npromoted by every possible means, and the directions of the physician be\r\nproperly observed.\r\n\r\nSuccess in the treatment of the sick requires good nursing. Without it,\r\nthe most skillful physicians fail to effect a cure; with it, the most\r\nunqualified may succeed. If certain hygienic agencies are essential to\r\nthe maintenance of health, how much more necessary it is that they be\r\nemployed in sickness! If certain conditions cause disease, how great the\r\nnecessity is that such conditions be obviated and hygienic ones\r\nsubstituted!\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the importance of good nursing, in the rural districts\r\nit is frequently difficult to find a professional nurse, or, if one can\r\nbe obtained, it is often impossible for the invalid to procure such\r\nservices, on account of the expense which must necessarily be incurred.\r\nHence, this office usually devolves upon some relative who is considered\r\nto be the best qualified for the position; or, as is often the case,\r\nnecessity demands that the patient be left to a change of nurses. A\r\nwoman is generally selected for this important position. Her soft hand\r\nand soothing voice, her kindly, sympathetic, and provident nature,\r\ntogether with her scrupulous cleanliness, render her man's equal, if not\r\nhis superior, in the capacity of nurse. There are circumstances,\r\nhowever, in which the services of a man are indispensable; hence the\r\nnecessity that all should be qualified to care for the sick.\r\n\r\nA nurse should be attentive to the requirements of physician and\r\npatient, for she sustains an intimate relation to both. She should\r\nobserve the directions of the physician, and faithfully perform them.\r\nShe should note all the symptoms of the patient, and do everything in\r\nher power to promote comfort and recovery. She should anticipate the\r\nwishes, and not cause the patient to ask for everything which is\r\ndesired. So far as practicable, let the wishes be gratified. The senses\r\nof the sick often become morbidly acute, and those things which in\r\nhealth would pass unnoticed, in sickness are so magnified as to occasion\r\nannoyance and vexation. Sick persons are not all alike, and the\r\npeculiarities of each must be studied separately. The nurse must be\r\n_kind_, but _firm_, and not yield to such whims of the patient as may be\r\ndetrimental to recovery; neither must she arouse dislike or anger by\r\nopposition, but endeavor to _win_ the patient from all delusions. The\r\nfeelings of the patient should never be trifled with, for idealities\r\nbecome realities.\r\n\r\nThe nurse should possess an inexhaustible store of patience. Disease\r\naffects the mind of the patient and fills it with strange delusions. The\r\nsick are often querulous, fretful, and unreasonable, and should be\r\ntreated with kindness, forbearance, and sympathy. The nurse should\r\nalways be cheerful, look on the bright side of every circumstance,\r\nanimate them with encouragement, and inspire them with hope. Hope is one\r\nof the best of tonics. It stimulates the flagging, vital energies, and\r\nimparts new life to the weak and exhausted forces. Gloom, sadness, and\r\ndespondency depress the vital forces and lead to death. We have seen\r\npatients rapidly sinking, who had given up all hope, and were quietly\r\nawaiting the coming of death, snatched, as it were, from its grasp, and\r\nrestored to health, by words of cheer and encouragement.\r\n\r\nThe nurse should possess _moral principles_, which alone can win the\r\nconfidence of the patient. She should have judgment, circumspection,\r\nintelligence, forethought, alacrity, carefulness, and neatness. In a\r\nword she should exercise _common sense_.\r\n\r\nWe deem it but justice to say a word in behalf of the nurse. She, too,\r\nis a human being, subject to disease, and, unless hygienic conditions be\r\nobserved, will soon be stricken low by its presence. She must be\r\nrelieved occasionally and get rest, or she cannot long withstand the\r\ncombined influence of fatigue and disease. Her office is an arduous one\r\nat best, and the long, weary hours of night-watching should be\r\ncompensated by exercise in the open air, as well as by sleep during the\r\nday. Unless this be done, the system will become exhausted, and sleep\r\nwill intrude itself upon her at the time when the greatest diligence is\r\nrequired for the welfare of the patient, when the vital powers are at\r\ntheir lowest ebb. She should be supplied with plenty of suitable food\r\nduring the night, to sustain her and to serve as a safeguard against the\r\ninvasion of disease. She should be treated with kindness and respect,\r\nelse her disposition may become morose and reflect itself upon the\r\npatient, causing peevishness and despondency.\r\n\r\nTHE SICK-ROOM should be as comfortable, cheerful, and pleasant, as\r\ncircumstances will allow. Let the room be large and airy, and furnished\r\nwith a stove, or better still, a fireplace. All articles of clothing and\r\nfurniture, not necessary to the comfort of the patient, should be\r\nremoved from the room, and in _malignant_ or _contagious_ diseases the\r\ncarpets, even, should not be permitted to remain. The surroundings beget\r\nhappiness or gloom, in proportion as they are pleasant or disagreeable.\r\nA tidy attendant, a few flowers and books, wonderfully enhance the\r\ncheerfulness of the room. Permit no unnecessary accumulation of bottles,\r\nor any thing that can in any way render the room unpleasant. Medicines,\r\ndrink, or nourishment should never be left uncovered in the sick-room,\r\nsince they quickly absorb the gaseous emanations from the patient, and\r\nbecome unfit for the purpose which they were intended to serve. Their\r\npresence gives the room an untidy appearance, suggestive of filth and\r\nslovenliness, and imparts to the patient a feeling of loathing and\r\ndisgust for articles of diet.\r\n\r\nTHE BED should not be of feathers, on account of their undue warmth,\r\nwhich causes a sensation of languor throughout the system. A husk or\r\nsea-grass mattress, or even a straw bed, covered with a cotton quilt, is\r\nfar preferable. The bedding should be changed frequently. It is better\r\nthat the bed should be away from the wall, so as to admit of greater\r\nfreedom of movement about it.\r\n\r\nPURE AIR. The air in the sick-room should be kept as pure as possible.\r\nThat which is so necessary in health, is indispensable in sickness. The\r\nimportance, therefore, of a perfect and free ventilation of the\r\nsick-room cannot be too thoroughly impressed; and yet to properly secure\r\nthis end, may call forth a considerable amount of ingenuity on the part\r\nof the nurse. A window should be open, but the current of air must not\r\nbe allowed to blow directly upon the patient. One window may be raised\r\nfrom the bottom and another lowered from the top. This will permit the\r\nentrance of pure air from without, and the exit of the vitiated air from\r\nwithin. The patient, if sufficiently covered in bed, is not liable to\r\ntake cold from a proper ventilation of the room. Especially is this\r\ntrue, when the bodily temperature is raised by febrile or inflammatory\r\naffections. The _temperature_ of a room is no indication of the _purity_\r\nof the air. It is a prevalent, but mistaken notion, that when a room is\r\ncold, the air must be pure. Cold air is as readily contaminated with\r\nimpurities as warm air, therefore, it is not sufficient that the room be\r\nkept cool, but the air should be frequently changed. During\r\nconvalescence, great care is necessary to protect the patient from\r\ntaking cold. Air which is admitted into the sick-room should not be\r\ncontaminated by passing over foul drains, privies, or other sources of\r\ninfection, since, instead of invigorating, it depresses the physical\r\nforces and generates disease.\r\n\r\nLIGHT is as necessary to health as is pure air. Banish either for any\r\ncontinuous period of time, and serious results follow. The strong,\r\nrobust man, when deprived of light, soon degenerates into a feeble,\r\nsickly being, and finally dies.\r\n\r\nAccording to the investigations of the Massachusetts Medical Society, it\r\nwas found that absence of sunlight, together with moisture, not only\r\nfavor the development of tubercular consumption, but act as an exciting\r\ncause. It is well known that persons living in shaded dwellings often\r\nsuffer from forms of disease which resist all treatment until proper\r\nadmission of light is secured.\r\n\r\nThe physician to the Emperor of Russia found upon examination that\r\npatients confined in well lighted wards, were four times as liable to\r\nrecover as were those in poorly lighted rooms. Children reared away from\r\nthe sunlight are apt to be deformed and idiotic, while those partially\r\ndeformed have been restored by being admitted to the light.\r\n\r\nPatients sometimes wish to have their rooms darkened, because the light\r\nis painful to their weak and sensitive eyes. It is far better to shade\r\nthe eyes and admit the sunlight into the room, since its rays cause\r\nchemical changes to take place, which favor the return of health. Many\r\ninvalids can ascribe their recovery to the influence of a sun bath.\r\nThere are, however, conditions in which the patients should be screened\r\nfrom the light. In such cases a little arrangement of the curtains or\r\nshutters will accomplish all that is to be desired.\r\n\r\nPatients convalescing from acute, or suffering from chronic diseases,\r\nshould receive the influence of light in the open air, and be in it\r\nseveral hours every day. Light and pure air stimulate a healthful\r\ndevelopment, induce cheerfulness, hope, and recovery, while darkness\r\nbegets gloom, sadness, despondency, disease, and ultimately death.\r\n\r\nWARMTH is essential to the well-being of the patient, and it is\r\nnecessary that a proper temperature be maintained in the room. Except in\r\nvery warm weather, a little fire should be kept in the room, and at the\r\nsame time fresh air should be admitted from without, and a uniform\r\ntemperature thus preserved. This arrangement is especially necessary in\r\nlocalities where great variations in temperature are experienced during\r\nthe day and night.\r\n\r\nThe normal temperature of the body ranges from 98° to 99° Fahr. The\r\nminimum occurs from 2 to 6 A.M.; the maximum, from 1 to 6 P.M. The\r\ndeviation of a few degrees from this standard indicates disease, and the\r\ngreater the deviation, the greater is its severity. During the early\r\nstages of acute diseases, the animal heat is generally increased, and\r\nshould be allayed by bathing, and cooling or acidulated drinks. In the\r\nlatter stages, the temperature becomes diminished and the condition of\r\nthe system is favorable to congestions, which are most likely to occur\r\nbetween the hours of 2 and 6 A.M., when the vital powers are lowest. The\r\npatient then becomes feeble, his extremities grow cold, and he has what\r\nis termed a \"sinking spell,\" and perhaps dies. It is during these hours\r\nthat additional covering, the application of hot bricks to the feet, and\r\nbottles of hot water to the limbs and body, friction upon the surface,\r\nstimulating drinks, and increased vigilance on the part of the nurse\r\nwill often save the patient's life. But, unfortunately, at these hours\r\nthe nurse is apt to get sleepy and inattentive, the demands of the\r\npatient go unheeded, and a sacrifice of life is the result.\r\n\r\nPersons suffering from chronic diseases, or those in feeble health,\r\nshould preserve their vital energies by dressing warmly, by wearing\r\nflannels next to the skin, and by carefully protecting the feet from\r\ncold and moisture.\r\n\r\nCLEANLINESS cannot be too thoroughly impressed upon the minds of those\r\nwho have the care of the sick. Filthiness is productive of disease and\r\nfavorable to its development. Bathing at least once a day, with pure,\r\nsoft water and toilet-soap, is strongly urged, and as this is designed\r\nfor cleanliness, the temperature of the bath should be made agreeable to\r\nthe patient.\r\n\r\nTHE CLOTHING AND BEDDING OF THE PATIENT in acute diseases, should be\r\nchanged frequently and thoroughly aired, if not washed. As soon as\r\nremoved, these articles should be taken from the room, replaced by\r\nothers _well aired and warmed._ The hands and face of the patient should\r\nbe bathed frequently, the hair combed, the teeth brushed, the nails\r\ncleaned, the lips moistened, and everything about him kept clean and\r\ntidy. These observances, although in themselves trifling, promote\r\ncomfort and cheerfulness, and contribute largely to the recovery of the\r\nsick. All excretions from the patient should be buried, and not\r\ncommitted to privies to communicate disease to those who frequent them.\r\n\r\nTHE DIET contains a very important relation to health. During the\r\nprocess of acute disease, the appetite is generally much impaired, if\r\nnot entirely absent. It should then be the study of the nurse to devise\r\nsuch articles of nourishment as will be acceptable to the patient and\r\nsuitable to the condition. The food should be light, nutritious, and\r\neasy of digestion.\r\n\r\nEach individual disease requires a diet adapted to its peculiarities.\r\nThose of an inflammatory character require an unstimulating diet, as\r\ngruel, barley-water, toast, etc. An exhausted or enfeebled condition of\r\nthe brain, unattended by irritability, demands a stimulating diet, as\r\nbeef, eggs, fish, Graham bread, oysters, etc. In wasting diseases, in\r\nwhich the temperature of the system is low, beef, fatty substances, rich\r\nmilk, sweet cream, and other carbonaceous articles of diet are\r\nrecommended. In the various forms of chronic ailments, the diet must be\r\nvaried according to the nature of the disease and the peculiarities of\r\nthe patient. Deranged digestion is generally an accompaniment of chronic\r\ndisease. A return to normal digestion should be encouraged by selecting\r\nappropriate articles of food, paying due regard to its quantity and\r\nquality, as well as to the manner and time of eating. The appearance of\r\nfood, and the manner in which it is offered, have much to do with its\r\nacceptance, or rejection by the patient. Let the nourishment be\r\npresented in a nice, clean dish, of a size and shape appropriate to the\r\nquantity. More food than can be eaten by the patient should not be\r\nplaced before him at one time, since a great quantity excites disgust\r\nand loathing. In taking nourishment, drink, or medicine, the patient, if\r\nfeeble, should not be obliged to change his position.\r\n\r\nMILK is one of the most important foods in fevers and acute diseases\r\nattended with great prostration, and in which the digestive powers are\r\nenfeebled. It contains within itself all the elements of nutrition.\r\n\r\nBEEF TEA furnishes an excellent nourishment for the sick, but there are\r\nfew, even among professional nurses who know how to properly prepare it.\r\nWe give three good recipes. One method is to chip up lean beef, put it\r\nin a porcelain or tin saucepan, cover it with _cold_ water, and bring it\r\nup to just below the boiling point, at which temperature _retain it_ for\r\nten minutes, then season and serve. Another method is similar to the\r\nforegoing, with this difference, that the juices of the meat are\r\nsqueezed through a piece of muslin or crash, making the tea richer.\r\nAnother way, which we consider preferable to either of the above, is to\r\ntake lean beef, cut it into fine bits, put them in a tightly covered\r\nvessel, which is placed in a kettle of water kept boiling. Thus the\r\nwhole strength of the juice will be obtained from the meat without\r\nlosing any of its properties. It can be seasoned to the taste, and\r\nreduced with water to suit the needs of the patient.\r\n\r\nSLEEP is \"Nature's grand restorer, a balm to all mankind; the best\r\ncomforter of that sad heart whom fortune's spite assails.\" It is\r\nnecessary in health, and doubly so in sickness. During sleep, the vital\r\nenergies recuperate, the forces are less rapidly expended, and the\r\nstrength increases. It is the great source of rest and refreshment.\r\nOften a day's rest in bed, free from the cares and anxieties of an\r\nactive life, is sufficient to ward off the approach of disease. If quiet\r\nand rest are essential to recuperation in health, their necessity in\r\ndisease must be apparent. Life frequently depends on tranquility and\r\nrepose, and the least noise or confusion disturbs the sufferer and\r\ndiminishes the chances of recovery. Nothing annoys sick or nervous\r\npersons more than whispering and the rustling of newspapers. If\r\nconversation be necessary, let the tones be modified, but never whisper.\r\nIn sickness, when the vital forces are low, the more natural rest and\r\nsleep the patient obtains, the greater is the prospect for recovery. As\r\na rule, _a patient should never be awakened when sleeping quietly_, not\r\neven to take _medicine_, unless in _extreme cases_. If the patient does\r\nnot sleep, the cause should be ascertained and the appropriate remedies\r\nemployed; if it arise from rush of blood to the head, cooling lotions\r\nshould be applied, and warmth to the feet; if, from restlessness or\r\ngeneral irritability, a sponge bath, followed by friction should be\r\nadministered; if the wakefulness is due to noise or confusion, quiet is\r\nthe remedy. When these means fail, anodynes, or nervines, should be\r\nemployed. Lying on the side instead of on the back should be practiced.\r\nPatients afflicted with chronic diseases, on rising, should take a cold\r\nbath, dry the surface quickly with a coarse towel, followed by friction\r\nwith the hand. Great benefit may be derived by following these\r\nsuggestions when the nature of the disease is not such as to forbid it.\r\n\r\nEXERCISE and rest necessarily alternate with each other. Exercise, so\r\nnecessary to health, in many forms of disease greatly contributes to\r\nrecovery. It sends the sluggish blood coursing through the veins and\r\narteries with increased force and rapidity, so that it reaches every\r\npart of the system, supplying it with nourishment. It increases the\r\nwaste of old material and creates a demand for new.\r\n\r\nConvalescing patients, or those suffering from chronic diseases,\r\nwhenever the weather will permit, should take exercise every day in the\r\nopen air. This should be done with regularity. The amount of exercise\r\nmust be regulated by the strength of the patient; never take so much as\r\nto produce fatigue, but, as the strength increases, the exercise may be\r\nincreased proportionately. Some interesting employment, commensurate\r\nwith the patient's strength, should be instituted, so that the mind may\r\nbe agreeably occupied with the body.\r\n\r\nWhen unable to take active exercise, the invalid, properly protected by\r\nsufficient clothing, should ride in a carriage or boat, and each day a\r\nnew route should be chosen, so that a change of scenery may be observed,\r\nthus arousing new trains of thought, which will be exhilarating and\r\nprove beneficial to him.\r\n\r\nSEXUAL INFLUENCES. During the progress of disease or convalescence,\r\nentire continence must be observed. It is then necessary that all of the\r\nvital energies should be employed in effecting a recovery from disease,\r\nwithout having the additional tax imposed of overcoming the debilitating\r\neffects of sexual expenditure. This holds true with regard to all\r\ndiseases, and especially those of the nervous system and genitourinary\r\norgans.\r\n\r\nVISITING THE SICK may be productive of good or evil results. Mental\r\nimpressions made upon the sick exert a powerful influence upon the\r\ntermination of disease. The chances of recovery are in proportion to the\r\nelevation or depression of spirits. Pleasant, cheerful associations\r\nanimate the patient, inspire hope, arouse the vital energies, and aid in\r\nhis recovery; while disagreeable and melancholy associations beget\r\nsadness and despondency, discourage the patient, depress the vital\r\npowers, enfeeble the body, and retard recovery.\r\n\r\nUnless persons who visit the sick can carry with them joy, hope, mirth,\r\nand animation, they had better stay away. This applies equally in acute\r\nand chronic diseases. It does not matter what a visitor may _think_ with\r\nregard to the patient's recovery, _an unfavorable opinion should never\r\nfind expression in the sick-room_. Life hangs upon a brittle thread, and\r\noften that frail support is _hope_. Cheer the sick by words of\r\nencouragement, and the hold on life will be strengthened; discourage, by\r\nuttering such expressions as, \"How bad you look!\" \"Why, how you have\r\nfailed since I saw you last!\" \"I would have another doctor; one who\r\nknows something!\" \"You can't live long if you don't get help!\" etc., and\r\nthe tie which binds them to earth is snapped asunder. The visitor\r\nbecomes a _murderer!_ Let all persons be guided by this rule: _Never go\r\ninto the sick-room without carrying with you a few rays of sunshine!_\r\n\r\nIf the patient is very weak the visitor may injure him by staying too\r\nlong. The length of the visit should be graduated according to the\r\nstrength of the invalid. Never let the sufferer be wearied by too\r\nfrequent or too lengthy visits, nor by having too many visitors at once.\r\nAbove all things, do not confine your visitations to Sunday. Many do\r\nthis and give themselves credit for an extra amount of piety on account\r\nof it, when, if they would scrutinize their motives more carefully, they\r\nwould see that it was but a contemptible resort to save time. The sick\r\nare often grossly neglected during the week only to be visited to death\r\nupon Sunday.\r\n\r\nTHE USE OF TOBACCO AND OPIUM. The recovery of the sick is often delayed,\r\nsometimes entirely prevented, by the habitual use of tobacco or opium.\r\nIn acute diseases, the appetite for tobacco is usually destroyed by the\r\nforce of the disease, and its use is, of necessity, discontinued; but in\r\nchronic ailments, the appetite remains unchanged, and the patient\r\ncontinues his indulgence greatly to the aggravation of the malady.\r\n\r\nThe use of tobacco is a pernicious habit in whatever form it is\r\nintroduced into the system. Its active principle, Nicotin, which is an\r\nenergetic poison, exerts its specific effect on the nervous system,\r\ntending to stimulate it to an unnatural degree of activity, the final\r\nresult of which is weakness, or even paralysis. The horse, under the\r\naction of whip and spur, may exhibit great spirit and rapid movements,\r\nbut urge him beyond his strength with these agents, and you inflict a\r\nlasting injury. Withhold the stimulants, and the drooping head and\r\nmoping pace indicate the sad reaction which has taken place. This\r\nillustrates the evils of habitually exciting the nerves by the use of\r\ntobacco, opium, narcotic or other drugs. Under their action, the tone of\r\nthe system is greatly impaired, and it responds more feebly to the\r\ninfluence of curative agents. Tobacco itself, when its use becomes\r\nhabitual and excessive, gives rise to the most unpleasant and dangerous\r\npathological conditions. Oppressive torpor, weakness or loss of\r\nintellect, softening of the brain, paralysis, nervous debility,\r\ndyspepsia, functional derangement of the heart, and diseases of the\r\nliver and kidneys are not uncommon consequences of the excessive\r\nemployment of this plant. A sense of faintness, nausea, giddiness,\r\ndryness of the throat, tremblings, feelings of fear, disquietude, and\r\ngeneral nervous prostration must frequently warn persons addicted to\r\nthis habit that they are sapping the very foundation of health. Under\r\nthe continued operation of a poison, inducing such symptoms as these,\r\nwhat chance is there for remedies to accomplish their specific action?\r\nWith the system already thoroughly charged with an influence\r\nantagonistic to their own, and which is sure to neutralize their effect,\r\nwhat good can medicine do?\r\n\r\nDr. King says, \"A patient under treatment should give up the use of\r\ntobacco, or his physician should assume no responsibility in his case,\r\nfurther than to do the best he can for him.\" In our own extensive\r\nexperience in the treatment of chronic diseases, we have often found it\r\nnecessary to resort to the same restriction.\r\n\r\nThe opium habit, to which allusion has also been made, is open to the\r\nsame objections, and must be abandoned by all who would seek recovery.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV.\r\n\r\nDISEASES AND THEIR REMEDIAL TREATMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nKnowledge which is conducive to self-preservation is of _primary_\r\nimportance. That great educator, profound thinker, and vigorous writer,\r\nHerbert Spencer, has pertinently said that, \"As vigorous health and its\r\naccompanying high spirits, are larger elements of happiness than any\r\nother things whatever, the teaching how to maintain them is a teaching\r\nthat yields to no other whatever. And therefore we assert that such a\r\ncourse of physiology as is needful for the comprehension of its general\r\ntruths and their bearings on daily conduct is an all-essential part of a\r\nrational education.\"\r\n\r\nBelieving that the diffusion of knowledge for the prevention of disease\r\nis quite as noble a work as the alleviation of physical suffering by\r\nmedical skill, we have devoted a large portion of this volume to the\r\nsubjects of physiology and hygiene. These we have endeavored to present\r\nin as familiar a style as possible, that they may be understood by every\r\nreader. Freely as we have received light upon these subjects have we\r\nendeavored to reflect it again, in hopes that a popular presentation of\r\nthese matters made plain and easy of comprehension to all people, may\r\nlead the masses into greater enjoyment of life--the result of a better\r\npreservation of health. This we do in part as a public acknowledgment of\r\nour obligations to society, to whom every professional man is a debtor.\r\nHe belongs to it, is a part of its common stock, and should give as well\r\nas receive advantages, return as well as accept benefits. We know of no\r\nbetter way to signify our appreciation of the public confidence and\r\npatronage, so generously accorded to us, than to offer this volume to\r\nthe people at a price less than the actual cost for an edition of\r\nordinary size. This we do as a token of the cordial reciprocation of\r\ntheir good will. In giving to the people wholesome advice, by which they\r\nmay be enabled to ward off disease and thus preserve the health of\r\nmultitudes, we believe we shall receive their hearty approval, as well\r\nas the approbation of our own conscience, both of which are certainly\r\nmunificent rewards. We believe that good deeds are always rewarded, and\r\nthat the physician who prevents sickness manifests a genuine and earnest\r\ndevotion to the common interests of humanity.\r\n\r\nWe have no respect for the motives of those medical men who would\r\nwithhold that information from the people which will direct the masses\r\nhow to take care of themselves, and thereby prevent much sickness and\r\nsuffering. Nor is the diffusion of such knowledge antagonistic to the\r\nbest interests of the true and competent physician. The necessity for\r\nhis invaluable services can no more be set aside by popularizing\r\nphysiological, hygienic, and medical truths, than we can dispense with\r\nthose of the minister and lawyer by the inculcation of the principles of\r\nmorality in our public schools. The common schools do not lessen the\r\nnecessity for colleges or universities, but rather contribute to their\r\nprosperity. Nor are we so presumptuous as to anticipate that we could\r\npossibly make this volume so instructive as to render \"every man his own\r\nphysician.\" No man can with advantage be his own lawyer, carpenter,\r\ntailor, and printer; much less can he hope to artfully repair his own\r\nconstitution when shattered by grave maladies, which not only impair the\r\nphysical functions, but weaken and derange the mental faculties. What\r\nphysician presumes to prescribe for himself, when suddenly prostrated by\r\nserious illness? He very sensibly submits to the treatment of another,\r\nbecause he realizes that sickness impairs his judgment, and morbid\r\nsensations mislead and unfit him for the exercise of his skill. If this\r\nis true of the physician, with how much greater force does it apply to\r\nthe unprofessional! If a sick sea-captain is unfit to stand at the helm\r\nand direct his ship, how utterly incompetent must the raw sailor be when\r\nsimilarly disqualified! Nor is the physician as competent to treat those\r\nnear and dear to him, when they are suffering from dangerous illness, as\r\nanother medical man not similarly situated, whose judgment is not liable\r\nto be misled by intense anxiety and affectionate sympathy.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all these facts, however, a knowledge on the part of the\r\nunprofessional, of something more than physiology and hygiene, and\r\nappertaining more closely to medicine proper, will many times prove\r\nvaluable.\r\n\r\nIn the first stage of many acute affections which, if unheeded,\r\ngradually assume a threatening aspect, endangering life and demanding\r\nthe services of the most skilled physician to avert fatal results, the\r\nearly administration of some common domestic remedy, such as a\r\ncathartic, or a diaphoretic herb, associated with a warm bath, a spirit\r\nvapor-bath, or a hot foot-bath, will very often obviate the necessity\r\nfor calling a family physician, and frequently save days and weeks of\r\nsickness and suffering.\r\n\r\nSo, likewise, are there numerous, acute diseases of a milder character\r\nwhich are easily and unmistakably recognized without the possession of\r\ngreat medical knowledge, and which readily yield to plain, simple,\r\nmedical treatment which is within the ready reach of all who strive to\r\nacquaint themselves with the rudiments of medical science. But in sudden\r\nand painful attacks of acute disease, life may be suddenly and\r\nunexpectedly jeopardized, and immediate relief prove necessary. While\r\nunder these circumstances the prompt application of such domestic\r\ntreatment as good common-sense may dictate, guided by a knowledge of\r\nthose first principles of medical learning which we shall hereafter\r\nendeavor to make plain, may result in speedy and happy relief, yet at\r\nthe same time there should be no delay in summoning a competent\r\nphysician to the bedside of the sufferer.\r\n\r\nThen, and not the least important, there are the various chronic or\r\nlingering diseases, from all of which few individuals indeed, who pass\r\nthe meridian of life, entirely escape. In this class of ailments there\r\nis generally no immediate danger, and, therefore, time may be taken by\r\nthe invalid for studying his disease and employing those remedies which\r\nare best suited for its removal. Or, if of a dangerous or complicated\r\ncharacter, and, therefore, not so readily understood, he may consult\r\neither personally or by letter, some learned and well-known physician,\r\nwho makes a specialty of the treatment of such cases, and whose large\r\nexperience enables him to excel therein.\r\n\r\nIn consideration, therefore, of the foregoing facts, we deem it most\r\nprofitable for our readers that Part Fourth of this volume should be\r\narranged in the following manner:\r\n\r\nThe milder forms of uncomplicated, acute diseases, which may be readily\r\nand unmistakably recognized, and successfully managed without\r\nprofessional aid, will receive that attention which is necessary to give\r\nthe reader a correct idea of them, and their proper remedial treatment.\r\n\r\nWe shall devote only such attention to the severe and hazardous forms of\r\nacute diseases as is necessary in order to consider their initial stage,\r\nwith their proper treatment, not attempting to trace their numerous\r\ncomplications, or portray the many pathological conditions which are\r\nliable to be developed. For, even by devoting much space to the latter,\r\nwe could not expect to qualify our unprofessional readers for\r\nsuccessfully treating such obscure and dangerous conditions.\r\n\r\nWe shall devote the largest amount of space to a careful and thorough\r\nconsideration of those chronic diseases, which, by a little study, may\r\nbe readily recognized and understood by the masses, and for the cure of\r\nwhich we shall suggest such hygienic treatment and domestic remedies as\r\nmay be safely employed by all who are in quest of relief. In the more\r\ndangerous, obscure, or complicated forms of chronic diseases, the\r\ncorrect diagnosis and successful treatment of which tax all the skill\r\npossessed by the experienced specialist, the invalid will not be misled\r\ninto the dangerous policy of relying upon his own judgment and\r\ntreatment, but will be counseled not to postpone until too late, the\r\nemployment of a skillful physician.\r\n\r\nThe apportionment of space which is made in considering the various\r\ndiseases and their different stages, as well as the course which the\r\npeople are advised to pursue under the different circumstances of\r\naffliction, is not always in accordance with the plans and\r\nrecommendations which have been made by others who have written works on\r\ndomestic medicine. Most of these authors have attempted, by lengthy\r\ndisquisitions, to teach their readers how to treat themselves without\r\nthe services of a physician, even in the most hazardous forms of\r\ndisease. In such dangerous maladies as typhoid, typhus, yellow, and\r\nscarlet fevers, typhoid pneumonia, and many others, in which life is\r\nimminently imperiled, such instruction and advice is decidedly\r\nreprehensible, as it may lead to the most serious consequences. We are\r\nconfident, therefore, that the manner of disposing of the different\r\nsubjects which are discussed in the succeeding chapters, and the course\r\nof action which is advised, will commend themselves to our readers as\r\nbeing such as are calculated to promote and subserve their best\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDICAL DIAGNOSIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSkill in the art of healing is indicated in three ways: (1.) by\r\nascertaining the _symptoms, seat_, and _nature_ of the disease, which is\r\ntermed _diagnosis_; (2.) by foretelling the probable termination, which\r\nis termed _prognosis_; (3.) by the employment of efficacious and\r\nappropriate remedies, which is called _treatment_. Of these three\r\nrequisites to a prosperous issue, nothing so distinguishes the expert\r\nand accomplished physician from the mere pretender as his ready ability\r\nto interpret correctly, the location, extent, and character of an\r\naffection from its symptoms. By medical diagnosis, then, is understood\r\nthe discrimination between diseases by certain symptoms which are\r\ndistinguishing signs. Every malady is accompanied by its characteristic\r\nindications, some of which are _diagnostic, i.e._, they particularize\r\nthe affection and distinguish it from all others.\r\n\r\nMedical diagnosis is both a _science_ and an _art_; a science when the\r\ncauses and symptoms of a disease are understood, and an art when this\r\nknowledge can be applied to determine its location and exact nature.\r\nScience presents the general principles of practice; art detects among\r\nthe characteristic symptoms the differential signs, and applies the\r\nremedy. Da Costa aptly remarks: \"No one aspiring to become a skillful\r\nobserver can trust exclusively to the light reflected from the writings\r\nof others; he must carry the torch in his own hands, and himself look\r\ninto every recess.\"\r\n\r\nThe critical investigation of symptoms, with the view of ascertaining\r\ntheir signs, is essential to successful practice. Without closely\r\nobserving them, we cannot accurately trace out the diagnosis, and a\r\nfailure to detect the right disease is apt to be followed by the use of\r\nwrong medicines.\r\n\r\nGeneral diagnosis considers the surroundings of the patient as well as\r\nthe actual manifestations of the disease. It takes into account the\r\ndiathesis, _i.e._, the predisposition to certain diseases in consequence\r\nof peculiarities of constitution. We recognize constitutional\r\ntendencies, which may be indicated by the contour of the body, its\r\ngrowth, stature, and temperament, since all these facts greatly modify\r\nthe treatment. Likewise the sex, age, climate, habits, occupation,\r\nprevious diseases, as well as the present condition, must be taken into\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nAuscultation, as practiced in detecting disease, consists in listening\r\nto the sounds which can be heard in the chest.\r\n\r\nPercussion consists in striking upon a part with the view of\r\nappreciating the sound which results. The part may be struck directly\r\nwith the tips of the fingers, but more generally one or more fingers of\r\nthe other hand are interposed between the points of the fingers and the\r\npart to be percussed, that they, instead of the naked chest, may receive\r\nthe blow; or, instead of the fingers, a flat piece of bone or ivory,\r\ncalled a _pleximeter_, is placed upon the chest to receive the blow.\r\n\r\nLatterly, improved instruments greatly assist the practitioner of\r\nmedicine in perfecting this art. The _microscope_ assists the eye, and\r\nhelps to reveal the appearance and character of the excretions,\r\ndetecting morbid degenerations; _chemistry_ discloses the composition of\r\nthe urine, which also indicates the morbid alterations occurring in the\r\nsystem; by percussion we can determine the condition of an internal\r\norgan, from the sound given when the external surface is percussed; the\r\near, with the aid of the _stethoscope_, detects the strange murmurs of\r\nrespiration, the fainter, more unnatural pulsations of life, and the\r\nobscurer workings of disease; with the _spirometer_ we determine the\r\nbreathing capacity of the lungs, and thus ascertain the extent of the\r\ninroads made by disease; the _dynamometer_ records the lifting ability\r\nof the patient; the _thermometer_ indicates the morbid variation in the\r\nbodily temperature; various instruments inform us of the structural\r\nchanges causing alterations in the specific gravity of fluids, _e.g_.,\r\nthe _urinometer_ indicates those occurring in the urine; and thus, as\r\nthe facilities for correct diagnosis increase, the art of distinguishing\r\nand classifying diseases becomes more perfect, and their treatment more\r\ncertain. While physiology treats of all the natural functions, pathology\r\ntreats of lesions and altered conditions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 146.\r\nDr. Brown's Spirometer.]\r\n\r\nBy the term _symptoms_ we mean the evidence of some morbid effect or\r\nchange occurring in the human body, and it requires close observation\r\nand well-instructed experience to convert these symptoms into diagnostic\r\nsigns. Suppose \"Old Probabilities\" (as we commonly designate the\r\ninvaluable Signal Department) hangs out his warning tokens all along our\r\nlake borders and ocean coasts; our sailors behold the fluttering symbols\r\nindicating an approaching storm, but if no one understood their meaning,\r\na fearful disaster might follow. But if these signals are understood, a\r\nsafe harbor is sought and the mariner is protected. So disease may hang\r\nout all her signals of distress, in order that they may be seen, but\r\nunless correctly interpreted, and a remedial harbor is sought, these\r\nsymptoms are of little practical value.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly the reason why so many symptom-doctors blunder is because\r\nthey prescribe according to the apparent symptoms, without any real\r\nreference to the nature of the affection. They fail to discover how far\r\na symptom points out the seat, and also the progress of a disease. They\r\ndo not distinguish the relative importance of the different symptoms.\r\nThe practical purpose of all science is to skillfully apply knowledge to\r\nsalutary and profitable uses. The patient himself may carefully note the\r\nindications, but it is only the expert physician who can tell the import\r\nof each symptom.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms_ are within every one's observation, but only the physician\r\nknows the nature and value of _signs_. We have read an anecdote of\r\nGalen, who was a distinguished physician in his day, which illustrates\r\nthe distinction between sign and symptom. Once, when dangerously ill, he\r\noverheard two of his friends in attendance upon him recount his\r\nsymptoms, such as \"Redness of the face, a dejected, haggard, and\r\ninflamed appearance,\" etc. He cried out to them to adopt every necessary\r\nmeasure forthwith, as he was threatened with delirium. The two friends\r\nsaw the _symptoms_ well enough; but it was only Galen himself, though\r\nthe _patient_, who was able to deduce the _sign_ of delirium--that is,\r\nhe alone was able to translate those symptoms into signs. To determine\r\nthe value of symptoms, as signs of disease, requires close observation.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERPRETATION OF SYMPTOMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe shall refer to a few symptoms which any unprofessional reader may\r\nreadily observe and understand.\r\n\r\nPOSITION OF PATIENT. When a patient is disposed to lie upon his back\r\ncontinually during the progress of an acute disease, it is a sign of\r\n_muscular debility_. If he manifests no desire to change his position,\r\nor cannot do so, and becomes tremulous at the least effort, it indicates\r\n_general prostration_. When this position is assumed, during the\r\nprogress of continued fever, and is accompanied by involuntary twitching\r\nof the muscles, picking of the bed-clothes, etc., then danger is\r\nimminent and _the patient is sinking_. Fever, resulting from local\r\ninflammation, does not produce muscular prostration, and the patient\r\nseldom or never assumes the supine position. If this inflammation is in\r\nthe extremities, those parts are elevated, in order to lessen the\r\npressure of the blood, which a dependent, position increases.\r\n\r\nFor example, let us change the scene, and introduce a patient with head\r\nand shoulders elevated, who prefers to sit up, and who places his hands\r\nbehind him and leans back, or leans forward resting his arms and head\r\nupon a chair. The next week he is worse, and no longer tries to lie in\r\nbed, but sits up all the time; note the anxious expression of\r\ncountenance, the difficult or hurried breathing, the dry and hacking\r\ncough, and observe that the least exertion increases the difficulty of\r\nrespiration and causes palpitation of the heart. These plain symptoms\r\nsignify thoracic effusion, the collection of water about the lungs.\r\n\r\nTHE COUNTENANCE displays diagnostic symptoms of disease. In simple,\r\nacute fevers, the eyes and face are red and the respiration is hurried;\r\nbut in acute, sympathetic fever, these signs are wanting. We cannot\r\nforget the pale, sharp, contracted, and pinched features of those\r\npatients whose nostrils contract and expand alternately with the acts of\r\nrespiration. How hard it was for them to breathe. The contraction and\r\nexpansion of the nostrils indicate active congestion of the lungs.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, chronic inflammation of the stomach, duodenum, liver,\r\nand adjacent organs, imparts a gloomy expression to the countenance, at\r\nthe same time the eye is dull, the skin dusky or yellow, and the motions\r\nare slow. But in lung diseases, the spirits are buoyant, the skin is\r\nfair, and the cheeks flushed with fever and distinctly circumscribed\r\nwith white, for delicacy and contrast, almost exceed the hues of health\r\nin beauty. Note, too, the pearly lustre and sparkling light of the eye,\r\nthe quivering motion of the lips and chin, all signs of pulmonary\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF SEXUAL ABUSE is plainly told by the downcast countenance,\r\nthe inability to look a person fairly in the face, the peculiar lifting\r\nof the upper lip and the furtive glance of the eye. The state of the\r\nmind and of the nervous system corroborates this evidence, for there\r\nseems to be a desire to escape from conversation and to elude society.\r\nThe mind seems engrossed and abstracted, the individual appears absorbed\r\nin a constant meditation, he is forgetful and loses nearly all interest\r\nin the ordinary affairs of life. The whole appearance of a patient,\r\nsuffering from spermatorrhea, is perfectly understood by the experienced\r\nphysician, for the facial expressions, state of mind, and movements of\r\nthe body, all unconsciously betray, and unitedly proclaim his condition.\r\n\r\nTONGUE. Much may be learned from the appearance, color, and form of the\r\ntongue, and the manner of its protrusion. If pale, moist, and coated\r\nwhite, it indicates a mild, febrile condition of the system. If coated\r\nin the center, and the sides look raw, it indicates gastric irritation.\r\nIf red and raw, or dry and cracked, it is a sign of inflammation of the\r\nmucous membrane of the stomach. If the inflammation is in the large\r\nintestine, the tip of the tongue presents a deep red color, while the\r\nmiddle is loaded with a dark brown coating. When the tongue is elongated\r\nand pointed, quickly protruded and withdrawn, it indicates irritation of\r\nthe nerve-centers, as well as of the stomach and bowels. If tremulous,\r\nit denotes congestion and lack of functional ability; this may be\r\nobserved in congestive fevers.\r\n\r\nPULSE. Usually the pulse beats four times during one respiration, but\r\nboth in health and disease its frequency may be accelerated or retarded.\r\nIn adults, there are from sixty-five to seventy-five beats in a minute,\r\nand yet in a few instances we have found, in health, only forty\r\npulsations per minute. But when the heart beats from one hundred and\r\ntwenty to one hundred and forty times a minute, there is reason to\r\napprehend danger, and the case should receive the careful attention of a\r\nphysician.\r\n\r\nIrregularity of the pulse may be caused by disease of the brain, heart,\r\nstomach, or liver; by the disordered condition of the nervous system; by\r\nlack of muscular nutrition, as in gout, rheumatism, or convulsions; by\r\ndeficiency of the heart's effective power, when the pulse-wave does not\r\nreach the wrist, or when it intermits and then becomes more rapid in\r\nconsequence of septic changes of the blood, as in diphtheria,\r\nerysipelas, and eruptive fevers.\r\n\r\nPAIN. The import of pain depends on its seat, intensity, nature, and\r\nduration. An acute, intense pain usually indicates inflammation of a\r\nnerve as well as the adjacent parts. Sharp, shooting, lancinating pains\r\noccur in inflammation of the serous tissues, as in pleurisy. A smarting,\r\nstinging pain attends inflammation of the mucous membrane. Acute pain is\r\ngenerally remittent and not fixed to one spot. Dull, heavy pain is more\r\npersistent, and is present in congestions, or when the substance of an\r\norgan is inflamed, and it often precedes hemorrhage. Burning pain\r\ncharacterizes violent inflammations involving the skin and subjacent\r\ncellular tissue, as in case of boils and carbuncles. Deep, perforating\r\npain accompanies inflammation of the bones, or of their enveloping\r\nmembranes. Gnawing, biting, lancinating pain attends cancers.\r\n\r\nThe location of pain is not always at the seat of the disease. In\r\nhip-disease, the pain is not first felt in the hip, but in the\r\nknee-joint. In chronic inflammation of the liver, the pain is generally\r\nmost severe in the right shoulder and arm. Disease of the kidneys\r\noccasionally produces numbness of the thigh and drawing up of the\r\ntesticle, and commonly causes colicky pains. Inflammation of the\r\nmeninges of the brain is often indicated by nausea and vomiting before\r\nattention is directed to the head. These illustrations are sufficient to\r\nshow that pain often takes place in some part remote from the disease.\r\n\r\nIn chronic, abdominal affections, rheumatic fevers, gout, and syphilis,\r\nthe entire system is thrown into a morbid state, the nervous system is\r\ndisturbed, and wandering pains manifest themselves in different parts of\r\nthe body. Fixed pain, which is increased by pressure, indicates\r\ninflammation. If it be due only to irritation, pressure will not\r\nincrease it. Some rheumatic affections and neuralgia not only bear\r\npressure, but the pain diminishes under it. Permanent pain shows that\r\nthe structures of an organ are inflamed, while intermittent pain is a\r\nsign of neuralgia, gout, or rheumatism. Absence of pain in any disease,\r\nwhere ordinarily it should be present, is an unfavorable sign. Internal\r\npain, after a favorable crisis, is a bad omen. Or, if pains cease\r\nsuddenly without the other symptoms abating, the import is bad. If,\r\nhowever, pain and fever remit simultaneously and the secretions\r\ncontinue, it is a favorable sign.\r\n\r\nA dull pain in the head indicates fullness of the blood-vessels from\r\nweakness, low blood, or general debility. It may be caused by taking\r\ncold, thus producing passive congestion of the brain. It may proceed\r\nfrom gastric disturbance, constipation of the bowels, or derangement of\r\nthe liver. Heaviness of the head sometimes precedes inflammation of the\r\nbrain, or chronic disease of its membranes. A dull, oppressive pain in\r\nthe head indicates softening of the brain, and is generally accompanied\r\nby slowness of the pulse and of the speech. A pulsating pain of the head\r\noccurs in heart disease, hysteria, and frequently accompanies some forms\r\nof insanity.\r\n\r\nTHE EYE indicates morbid changes and furnishes unmistakable signs of\r\ndisease. Sinking of the eye indicates waste, as in consumption,\r\ndiarrhea, and cholera. In fevers it is regarded as a fatal symptom. A\r\ndark or leaden circle around the eye, seen after hard work, indicates\r\nfatigue and overdoing. If the mucous covering of the inner surface of\r\nthe lids and the ball of the eye is congested and inflamed, it exhibits\r\nredness, and may indicate congestion or even inflammation of the brain.\r\n\r\nA dilated pupil is often observed in catarrhal consumption, congestion\r\nof the brain, low fevers, and chlorosis.\r\n\r\nThe pupil contracts in inflammation of the meninges, when there is\r\nincreased sensibility and intolerance of light, also in spinal\r\ncomplaints. In some diseases the lustre of the eye increases, as in\r\nconsumption. But if it decreases with the attack of violent disease, it\r\nindicates great debility and prostration.\r\n\r\nEXAMINATION OF THE URINE. All medical authors and physicians of\r\neducation, freely admit and even insist upon the importance of\r\ncritically examining the patient's urine, in all cases in which there is\r\nreason to suspect disease of the kidneys or bladder. In chronic\r\naffections it is particularly serviceable, especially in derangements of\r\nthe liver, blood, kidneys, bladder, prostate gland, and nervous system.\r\nMany scholarly physicians have sadly neglected the proper inspection of\r\nthe urine, because they were afraid of being classed with the illiterate\r\n\"uroscopian\" doctors, or fanatical enthusiasts, who ignorantly pretend\r\nto diagnose correctly _all_ diseases in this manner, thus subjecting\r\nthemselves and their claims to ridicule. Nothing should deter one from\r\ngiving to this excretion the attention it deserves.\r\n\r\nThe urine which is voided when the system is deranged or diseased is\r\naltered in its color and composition, showing that its ingredients vary\r\ngreatly. So important an aid do examinations of the urine furnish in\r\ndiagnosing many chronic ailments, that at the Invalids' Hotel and\r\nSurgical Institute, where many thousands of cases are annually treated,\r\na chemical laboratory has been fitted up, and a skillful chemist is\r\nemployed, who makes a specialty of examining the urine, both chemically\r\nand microscopically, and reporting the result to the attending\r\nphysicians. His extended experience renders his services invaluable.\r\nWith his assistance, maladies which had hitherto baffled all efforts put\r\nforth to determine their true character, have frequently been quickly\r\nand unmistakably disclosed.\r\n\r\nMICROSCOPICAL EXAMINATION. This method of examination affords a quicker\r\nand more correct idea of a deposit or deposits than any other method.\r\nThe expert, by simply looking at a specimen, can determine the character\r\nof the urine, whether blood, mucus, pus, uric acid, etc., are present or\r\nnot. But when no deposit is present, then it is necessary to apply\r\nchemical tests, and in many cases the quantity of the suspected\r\ningredient must be determined by analysis. As a detailed account, of the\r\nvarious modifications which the urine undergoes in different diseases,\r\nwould be of no practical use to the masses, since they could not avail\r\nthemselves of the advantages which it would afford for correct\r\ndiagnosis, except by the employment of a physician who does not ignore\r\nthis aid in examining his patients, we shall omit all further details\r\nupon the subject. For the same reason we shall not often, in treating of\r\nthe different diseases in which examinations of the urine furnish such\r\nvaluable aid in forming a diagnosis, make mention of the changes which\r\nare likely to have occurred.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLAMMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe term _Inflammation_ signifies a state in which the infected part is\r\nhotter, redder, more congested, and more painful than is natural.\r\nInflammation is limited to certain parts, while fever influences the\r\nsystem generally. Inflammation gives rise to new formations, morbid\r\nproducts, and lesions, or alterations of structure. The morbid products\r\nof fever, and its modification of fluids are carried away by the\r\nsecretions and excretions.\r\n\r\nThe susceptibility of the body to inflammation maybe _natural_ or\r\n_acquired_. It is natural when it is constitutional; that is, when there\r\nis an original tendency of the animal economy to manifest itself in some\r\nform of inflammation. We may notice that some children are far more\r\nsubject to boils, croups, and erysipelatous diseases than others. This\r\nsusceptibility, when innate, may be lessened by careful medication,\r\nalthough it may never be wholly eradicated. When acquired, it is the\r\nresult of the influence of habits of life, climate, and the state of\r\nmind over the constitution\r\n\r\nPhlegmonous inflammation is the active inflammation of the cellular\r\nmembrane, one illustration of which is a common boil. The four principal\r\nsymptoms are redness, swelling, heat, and pain; and then appears a\r\nconical, hard, circumscribed tumor, having its seat in the dermoid\r\ntexture. At the end of an indefinite period, it becomes pointed, white\r\nor yellow, and discharges pus mixed with blood. When it breaks, a small,\r\ngrayish, fibrous mass sometimes appears, which consists of dead,\r\ncellular tissue, and which is called the _core_.\r\n\r\nThere are certain morbid states of the constitution which lead to local\r\ninflammation, subsequent upon slight injury; or, in some cases, without\r\nany such provocation, as in gout, rheumatism, and scrofula. One of the\r\nfirst results of the inflammation, in such cases, is a weakening of the\r\nforces which distribute the blood to the surface and extremities of the\r\nbody. It is generally admitted that in scrofulous persons the vascular\r\nsystem is weak, the vessels are small, and because nutrition is faulty,\r\nthe blood is _imperfectly organized_. The result is failure in the\r\nsystem, for if nutrition fails, there may be lacking earthy matter for\r\nthe bones, or the unctious secretions of the skin; the sebaceous\r\nsecretion is albuminous and liable to become dry, producing inflammation\r\nof the parts which it ought to protect.\r\n\r\nDisorder of the alimentary canal and other mucous surfaces are sometimes\r\nreflected upon the skin. We have occasionally observed cutaneous\r\neruptions and erysipelas, when evidently they were distinct signs of\r\ninternal disorder.\r\n\r\nInflammation may be internal as well as external, as inflammation of the\r\nbrain, lungs, or stomach, and it is frequently the result of what is\r\ncalled a _cold_. No matter how the body is chilled, the blood retreats\r\nfrom the surface, which becomes pale and shrunken, there is also nervous\r\nuneasiness, and frequently a rigor, accompanied with chattering of the\r\nteeth. After the cold stage, reaction takes place and fever follows. The\r\nsudden change from a dry and heated room to a cool and moist atmosphere\r\nis liable to induce a cold. Riding in a carriage until the body is\r\nshivering, or sitting in a draft of air when one has been previously\r\nheated, or breathing a very cold air during the night when the body is\r\nwarm, especially when not accustomed to doing so, or exposing the body\r\nto a low temperature when insufficiently clothed, are all different ways\r\nof producing inflammation.\r\n\r\nInflammation may result in consequence of local injury, caused by a\r\nbruise, or by a sharp, cutting instrument, as a knife or an axe, or it\r\nmay be caused by the puncture of a pin, pen-knife blade or a fork-tine,\r\nor from a lacerated wound, as from the bite of a dog, or from a very\r\nminute wound poisoned by the bite of a venomous reptile. Local\r\ninflammations may arise from scalds, burns, the application of caustics,\r\narsenic, corrosive sublimate, cantharides, powerful acids, abrasions of\r\nthe surface by injuries, and from the occurrence of accidents.\r\n\r\nThe _swelling_ of the part may be caused by an increase of the quantity\r\nof blood in the vessels, the effusion of serum and coagulating lymph,\r\nand the interruption of absorption by the injury, or by the altered\r\ncondition of the inflamed part.\r\n\r\nThe character of the _pain_ depends upon the tissue involved, and upon\r\nthe altered or unnatural state of the nerves. Ordinarily, tendon,\r\nligament, cartilage, and bone are not very sensitive, but when inflamed\r\nthey are exquisitely so.\r\n\r\nThe heat of the inflamed part is not so great, when measured by the\r\nthermometer, as might be supposed from the patient's sensations.\r\n\r\nTERMINATION OF INFLAMMATION. Inflammation ends in one of six different\r\nways. Inflammation may terminate in _resolution, i.e_., spontaneous\r\nrecovery; by _suppuration_, in the formation of matter; by _effusion_,\r\nas the inflammation caused by a blister-plaster terminates by effusion\r\nof water; by _adhesion_, the part inflamed forming an attachment to some\r\nother part; by _induration_, hardening of the organ; or by _gangrene_,\r\nthat is, death of the part.\r\n\r\nThus, inflammation of the lungs may terminate by recovery, that is, by\r\nresolution, by suppuration and raising of \"matter,\" by hardening and\r\nsolidification of the lung, or by gangrene. Inflammation of the\r\nendocardium, the lining membrane of the heart, may cause a thickening of\r\nit, and ossification of the valves of the heart, thus impairing its\r\nfunction. Inflammation of the pericardium may terminate in effusion, or\r\ndropsy, and inflammation of the liver may result in hardening and\r\nadhesion to adjacent parts.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEVERAL PRINCIPLES FOR TREATMENT OF INFLAMMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nRemove the exciting causes as far as practicable. If caused by a\r\nsplinter or any foreign substance, it should be withdrawn, and if the\r\ninjury is merely local, apply cold water to the parts to subdue the\r\ninflammation. If caused by a rabid animal, the wound should be enlarged\r\nand cupped, and the parts cleansed or destroyed by caustic. The patient\r\nshould remain quiet and not be disturbed. The use of tincture of aconite\r\ninternally, will be found excellent to prevent the rise of inflammation.\r\nA purgative is also advised, and four or five of Dr. Pierce's Pleasant\r\nPurgative Pellets will be sufficient to act upon the bowels. If there is\r\npain, an anodyne and diaphoretic is proper. Dr. Pierce's Compound\r\nExtract of Smart-weed will fulfill this indication. In local\r\ninflammation cold water is a good remedy, yet sometimes hot water, or\r\ncloths wrung out of it, will be found to be the appropriate application.\r\nWhen the inflammation is located in an organ within a cavity, as the\r\nlungs, hot fomentations will be of great service. Bathing the surface\r\nwith alkaline water must not be omitted. Whenever the inflammation is\r\nserious the family physician should be early summoned.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEVER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn fever all the functions are more or less deranged. In every\r\nconsiderable inflammation there is sympathetic fever, but in essential\r\nfevers there are generally fewer lesions of structure than in\r\ninflammation. Fever occasions great waste of the tissues of the body,\r\nand the refuse matter is carried away by the organs of secretion and\r\nexcretion. The heat of the body in fever is generally diffused, the\r\npulse is quicker, there is dullness, lassitude, chilliness, and\r\ndisinclination to take food. We propose to give only a general outline\r\nof fevers, enough to indicate the principles which should be observed in\r\ndomestic treatment.\r\n\r\nMost fevers are distinctly marked by four stages: 1st, the forming\r\nstage; 2d, the cold stage; 3d, the hot stage; 4th, the sweating or\r\ndeclining stage. During the first stage the individual is hardly\r\nconscious of being ill, for the attack is so slight that it is hardly\r\nperceptible. True, as it progresses, there is a feeling of languor, an\r\nindisposition to make any bodily or mental effort, and also a sense of\r\nsoreness of the muscles, aching of the bones, chilliness, and a\r\ndisposition to get near the fire. There is restlessness, disturbed\r\nsleep, bad dreams, lowness of spirits, all of which are characteristic\r\nof the formative stage of fever.\r\n\r\nThe next is the cold stage, when there is a decided manifestation of the\r\ndisease, and the patient acknowledges that he is really sick. In typhus\r\nand typhoid fever the chills are slight; in other fevers they are more\r\nmarked; while in ague they are often accompanied by uncontrollable\r\nshaking. When the chill is not so distinct the nails look blue and the\r\nskin appears shriveled, the eye is sunken and a dark circle\r\ncircumscribes it, the lips are blue, and there is pain in the back. The\r\npulse is frequent, small, and depressed, the capillary circulation\r\nfeeble, the respiration increased, and there may be nausea and vomiting.\r\nThese symptoms vary in duration from a few minutes to more than an hour.\r\nThey gradually abate, reaction takes place, and the patient begins to\r\nthrow off the bed-clothes.\r\n\r\nThen follows the hot stage, for with the return of the circulation of\r\nthe blood to the surface of the body, there is greater warmth, freer\r\nbreathing, and a more comfortable and quiet condition of the system. The\r\nveins fill with blood, the countenance brightens, the cheeks are\r\nflushed, the intellect is more sprightly, and if the pulse is frequent,\r\nit is a good sign; if it sinks, it indicates feeble, vital force, and is\r\nnot a good symptom. If there is considerable determination of blood to\r\nthe head it becomes hot, the arteries of the neck pulsate strongly, and\r\ndelirium may be expected. During the hot stage, if the fever runs high,\r\nthe patient becomes restless, frequently changes his position, is\r\nwakeful, uneasy, and complains of pain in his limbs. In low grades, the\r\nsensibility is blunted, smell, taste, and hearing are impaired.\r\n\r\nThe patient in the hot stage is generally thirsty, and if he is allowed\r\nto drink much, it may result in nausea and vomiting. Moderate indulgence\r\nin water, however, is permissible. There is aversion to food, and if any\r\nis eaten, it remains undigested. The teeth are sometimes covered with\r\ndark _sordes_ (foul accumulations) early in the fever, and the\r\nappearance of the tongue varies, sometimes being coated a yellowish\r\nbrown, sometimes red and dry, at other times thickly coated and white.\r\nThe condition of the bowels varies from constipation to diarrhea,\r\nalthough sometimes they are quite regular. The urine is generally\r\ndiminished in quantity, but shows higher color.\r\n\r\nThe sweating stage in some fevers is very marked, while in others there\r\nis very little moisture, but an evident decline of the hot stage, the\r\nskin becoming more natural and soft. The pulse is more compressible and\r\nless frequent, the kidneys act freely, respiration is natural, the pains\r\nsubside, although there remains languor, lassitude, and weariness, a\r\npreternatural sensibility to cold, an easily excited pulse, and a pale\r\nand sickly aspect of the countenance. The appetite has failed and the\r\npowers of digestion are still impaired.\r\n\r\nDOMESTIC MANAGEMENT OF FEVERS. It is proper to make a thorough study of\r\nthe early, insidious symptoms of fever, in order to understand what\r\nought to be done. If it arises in consequence of malaria, the treatment\r\nmust be suited to the case. If from irritation of the bowels and\r\nimproper articles of diet, then a mild cathartic is required. If there\r\nis much inflammation, a severe chill, and strong reaction, then the\r\ntreatment should be active. If the fever is of the congestive variety\r\nand the constitution is feeble, the reaction imperfect, a small, weak\r\npulse, a tendency to fainting, a pale countenance, and great pain in the\r\nhead, apply heat and administer diaphoretics, and procure the services\r\nof a good physician.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, it is proper to administer a cathartic, unless in\r\ntyphoid fever, and for this Dr. Pierce's Purgative Pellets answer the\r\npurpose, given in doses of from four to six, according to the state of\r\nthe bowels. If these are not at hand, a tea of sage and senna may be\r\ndrunk until it produces a purgative effect, or a dose of Rochelle salts\r\ntaken. In nearly all fevers we have found that a weak, alkaline tea,\r\nmade from the white ashes of hickory or maple wood, is useful, taken\r\nweak, three or four times daily, or if there be considerable thirst,\r\nmore frequently. Some patients desire lemon juice, which enters the\r\nsystem as an alkali and answers all purposes.\r\n\r\nDiaphoretic medicines are also indicated, and the use of Dr. Pierce's\r\nExtract of Smart-weed will prove very serviceable. Drinking freely of\r\npleurisy-root tea, or of a strong decoction of boneset is frequently\r\nuseful. After free sweating has been established, then it is proper to\r\nfollow by the use of diuretic teas, such as that of spearmint and\r\npumpkin seed combined, or sweet spirits of nitre, in doses of twenty to\r\nthirty drops, added to a teaspoonful of the Extract of Smart-weed,\r\ndiluted with sweetened water.\r\n\r\nTo lessen the frequency of the pulse, fluid extract or tincture of\r\naconite or veratrum may be given in water, every hour. During the\r\nintermission of symptoms, tonic medicines and a sustaining course of\r\ntreatment should be employed. If the tongue is loaded and the\r\nevacuations from the bowels are fetid, a solution of sulphite of soda is\r\nproper; or, take equal parts of brewer's yeast and water, mix, and when\r\nthe yeast settles, give a tablespoonful of the water every hour, as an\r\nantiseptic. Administering a warm, alkaline hand-bath to a fever patient\r\nevery day, is an excellent febrifuge remedy, being careful not to chill\r\nor induce fatigue. If there is pain in the head, apply mustard to the\r\nfeet; if it is in the side, apply hot fomentations.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms which indicate danger are a tumid and hard abdomen,\r\ndifficult breathing, offensive and profuse diarrhea, bloody urine,\r\ndelirium, or insensibility. Favorable symptoms are a natural and soft\r\nstate of the skin, eruptions on the surface, a natural expression of the\r\ncountenance, moist tongue, free action of the kidneys, and regular\r\nsleep. If the domestic treatment which we have advised does not break\r\nthe force of the disease and mitigate the urgency of the symptoms, it\r\nwill be safer to employ a good physician, who will prescribe such a\r\ncoarse of treatment as the case specially requires. It is our aim to\r\nindicate what may be done before the physician is called, for frequently\r\nhis services cannot be obtained when they are most needed. Besides, if\r\nthese attacks are early and properly treated with domestic remedies, it\r\nwill often obviate the necessity of calling upon a physician. If, on the\r\nother hand, fevers are neglected and no treatment instituted, they\r\nbecome more serious in character and are more difficult to cure.\r\n\r\nTo recapitulate, our treatment recommends evacuation through nature's\r\noutlets, the skin, kidneys, and bowels, maintaining warmth, neutralizing\r\nacidity, using antiseptics, tonics, and the hand-bath, and the fluid\r\nextract or tincture of aconite, or veratrum to moderate the pulse by\r\ncontrolling the accelerated and unequal circulation of the blood. It is\r\na simple treatment, but if judiciously followed, it will often abort a\r\nfever, or materially modify its intensity and shorten its course.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEVER AND AGUE. (INTERMITTENT FEVER.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe description of fever already given applies well to this form of it,\r\nonly the symptoms in the former stage are rather more distinct than in\r\nthe other varieties. Weariness, lassitude, yawning, and stretching, a\r\nbitter taste in the mouth, nausea, less of appetite, the uneasy state of\r\nthe stomach and bowels are more marked in the premonitory stages of\r\nintermittent fevers. The cold stage commences with a chilliness of the\r\nextremities and back, the skin looks pale and shriveled, the blood\r\nrecedes from the surface, respiration is hurried, the urine is limpid\r\nand pale, sometimes there is nausea and vomiting, and towards the\r\nconclusion of the stage, the chilly sensations are varied with flushes\r\nof heat. The hot stage is distinguished by the heat and dryness of the\r\nsurface of the body and the redness of the face; there is great thirst,\r\nstrong, full, and hard pulse, free and hurried respiration and increased\r\npain in the head and back. The sweating stage commences by perspiration\r\nappearing upon the forehead, which slowly extends over the whole body,\r\nand soon there is an evident intermission of all the symptoms. In the\r\ninflammatory variety of intermittent fever, all these symptoms are\r\nacute, short, and characterized by strong reaction. Gastric fever, the\r\nmost frequent variety of intermittent fever, is marked by irritation of\r\nthe stomach and bowels, and a yellow appearance of the white of the eye.\r\n\r\nCAUSES. The cause of the malarial fevers, intermittent, remittent, and\r\ncongestive, is supposed to be _miasm_, a poisonous, gaseous exhalation\r\nfrom decaying vegetation, which is generally most abundant in swamps and\r\nmarshes, and which is absorbed into the system through the lungs.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. During the entire paroxysm the patient should be kept in bed,\r\nand in the cold stage, covered with blankets and surrounded with bottles\r\nof hot water. The Compound Extract of Smart-weed should be administered\r\nin some diaphoretic herb-tea. During the hot stage, the extra clothing\r\nand the bottles of hot water should be gradually removed and cold drinks\r\ntaken instead of warm. During the sweating stage the patient should be\r\nleft alone, but as soon as the perspiration ceases, from two to four of\r\nthe Purgative Pellets should be administered, as a gentle cathartic. A\r\nsecond paroxysm should, if possible, be prevented. To accomplish this,\r\nduring the intermission of symptoms, the Golden Medical Discovery should\r\nbe taken in doses of from two to three teaspoonfuls every four hours in\r\nalternation with three-grain doses of the sulphate of quinine. If the\r\nattack is very severe, and is not relieved by this treatment, a\r\nphysician should be summoned to attend the case.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMITTENT FEVER. (BILIOUS FEVER.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe distinction between _intermittent_ and _remittent_ fever does not\r\nconsist in a difference of origin. In the former disease there is a\r\ncomplete intermission of the symptoms, while in the latter there is only\r\na remission.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. The treatment should consist in the employment of those\r\nremedial agents advised in intermittent fever, the Golden Medical\r\nDiscovery and quinine being taken during the remission of symptoms.\r\nDuring the height of the fever, tincture of aconite maybe given and an\r\nalkaline sponge-bath administered with advantage. As in intermittent\r\nfever, should the course of treatment here advised not promptly arrest\r\nthe disease, the family physician should be summoned.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONGESTIVE FEVER. (PERNICIOUS FEVER.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the most severe and dangerous form of malarial fever. It may be\r\neither intermittent or remittent in character. In some instances the\r\nfirst paroxysm is so violent as to destroy life in a few hours, while in\r\nothers it comes on insidiously, the first one or two paroxysms being\r\ncomparatively mild. It is frequently characterized by stupor, delirium,\r\na marble-like coldness of the surface, vomiting and purging, jaundice,\r\nor hemorrhage from the nose and bowels. In America this fever is only\r\nmet with in the Mississippi valley, and in other localities where the\r\nair contains a large quantity of malarial poison.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. This fever is so dangerous that a physician should be\r\nsummoned as soon as the disease is recognized. For the benefit of those\r\nwho are unable to obtain medical attendance, we will say that the\r\ntreatment should be much the same as in intermittent fever, but more\r\nenergetic. Quinine should be taken in doses of from five to fifteen\r\ngrains every two or three hours. If it be not retained by the stomach,\r\nthe following mixture may be administered by injection: sulphate of\r\nquinine, one-half drachm; sulphuric acid, five drops; water, one ounce;\r\ndissolve, and then add two ounces of starch water.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTINUED FEVERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of these fevers do not intermit and remit, but _continue_\r\nwithout any marked variation for a certain period. They are usually\r\ncharacterized by great prostration of the system, and are called\r\n_putrid_ when they manifest septic changes in the fluids, and\r\n_malignant_ when they speedily run to a fatal termination. _Typhoid_ and\r\n_typhus_ fevers belong to this class. We shall not advise treatment for\r\nthese more grave disorders which should always, for the safety of the\r\npatient, be attended by the family physician, except to recommend some\r\nsimple means which may be employed in the initial stage of the disease,\r\nor when a physician's services cannot be promptly secured.\r\n\r\n\r\nTYPHOID FEVER. (ENTERIC FEVER.)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn typhoid fever there is ulceration of the intestines and mesenteric\r\nglands. This diseased condition of the bowels distinguishes this fever\r\nfrom all others, and is readily detected by sensitiveness to pressure,\r\nespecially over the lower part of the abdomen on the right side. The\r\nearly disposition to diarrhea is another characteristic symptom of it,\r\nand there is also no intermission of symptoms as in intermittent fever.\r\nThe disease comes on insidiously, with loss of appetite, headache,\r\nchilliness, and languor. It is usually a week or more before the disease\r\nbecomes fully developed.\r\n\r\nCAUSE. Typhoid fever is a specific form of fever developed from the\r\naction of a specific germ upon a susceptible system. The poison of\r\ntyphoid fever is eliminated mainly through the bowels. The germs of\r\ntyphoid can maintain life for months in water, and thus it happens that\r\nponds, lakes, rivers and streams which receive sewage can spread the\r\ngerms of typhoid fever. Well water often swarms with these poisonous\r\ngerms. In some cases it has been found that privies, though twenty or\r\nforty feet away from a well, have yet drained into it--through a clay\r\nsoil covered with gravel--and carried the germs to those drinking the\r\nwater from the well. Next to water, milk is the most prominent carrier\r\nof contagion. Milk is apt to get infected with the germs if cooled in\r\ntanks of water which may receive drainage from outhouses and barns.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. Scientific support has been given the treatment by cold tub\r\nbaths (70° Fahrenheit) and it is advised by many physicians. Experience\r\nhas proved that sponge baths and tub baths are of the utmost importance,\r\nwhen the temperature of the patient is at or above 102.5° Fahrenheit.\r\nEvery three hours the tub bath is given for twenty minutes at 70°\r\nFahrenheit. These may be tepid at first, gradually cooling to 70°.\r\nFrictions are applied to patient in the bath, and he is wrapped in\r\nblankets when taken out to avoid danger of chill, and then given a warm\r\ndrink or stimulant. Treatment should be directed by an experienced\r\nphysician to suit the symptoms. The evacuations from the bowels should\r\nbe thoroughly disinfected with chloride of lime or carbolic acid, that\r\nthey may not convey the disease to others. All the sewerage and drain\r\npipes in the house should likewise be disinfected.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCARLET FEVER. (SCARLATINA.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis fever takes its name from the scarlet color of the eruption on the\r\nsurface of the body. Sometimes it is comparatively mild, and is then\r\ncalled _Scarlatina Simplex_; when it is accompanied by a sore throat, it\r\nis termed _Scarlatina Anginosa_; and when the disease is of a low,\r\nputrid type, it is called _Scarlatina Maligna._ This disease has three\r\ndistinct stages: (1), the stage of invasion; (2), the stage of eruption;\r\nand (3), the stage of desquamation. In the first stage there is pain in\r\nthe head, increased heat of the skin, redness and soreness of the\r\nthroat, and sometimes nosebleed, diarrhea, or vomiting. The average\r\nduration of this stage is twenty-four hours. The eruptive stage\r\ngenerally begins on the second day, though sometimes it is delayed\r\nlonger, and the scarlet rash rapidly diffuses itself over the whole\r\nbody. The redness is vivid and has been compared to the appearance of a\r\nboiled lobster. The stage of eruption reaches its maximum of intensity\r\non the third day, and it is important that it does not recede. Redness\r\nof the tonsils and throat is one of the early symptoms which precedes\r\nany cutaneous eruption. The tongue also is finely spotted with numerous\r\nred points which mark its papillae, presenting an appearance which has\r\nbeen compared to that of a strawberry.\r\n\r\nThe thirst is urgent, there is no appetite, and vomiting and mild\r\ndelirium are common. This stage continues from four to six days, and\r\nsometimes longer. Desquamation (scaling off of the skin) commences at\r\nthe decline of the eruption, in the form of minute, branny scales. The\r\nduration of this stage is indefinite, and may end in five or six or may\r\ncontinue ten or twelve days.\r\n\r\nIf the inflammation in the throat is very severe, it may terminate in an\r\nabscess, which may also occur in the glands of the neck, and sometimes\r\nthe inflammation extends to the lips, cheeks, and eyelids. Gangrene\r\nwithin the throat occurs in rare instances. The disease is easily\r\ncommunicated, and usually develops in two to five days after exposure.\r\nIt occurs most frequently in the third and fourth years of life. There\r\nis no other disease so simple, and yet so often liable to prove fatal,\r\nas scarlet fever; and for this reason we shall advise the attendance of\r\nthe family physician.\r\n\r\nDomestic treatment may be given as follows, until a physician can be\r\nobtained: Catnip, pennyroyal, or pleurisy-root tea, containing one\r\nteaspoonful of the Extract of Smart-weed, may be given, to drive the\r\nrash to the surface. Cold drinks are suitable to allay the thirst,\r\nnausea, and fever. The sick-room should be kept at a temperature of\r\nabout 65° Fahr., and fresh air admitted freely. The patient ought not to\r\nbe overloaded with bed-clothes; and the skin should be sponged over\r\ntwice daily with tepid water, different parts being exposed\r\nsuccessively, and carefully dried with soft cloths. Soda may be added to\r\nthe water, but no soap should be used. The diet should consist of milk,\r\nextract of beef, and soups. Injections may be employed to relieve\r\nconstipation, but purgatives should be avoided. We repeat that this\r\ndisease is one which requires the attendance of the family physician,\r\nand great care should be exercised during recovery, that no bad results\r\nmay follow.\r\n\r\n\r\nSMALL-POX. (VARIOLA.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSmall-pox is produced by a specific poison, which is reproduced and\r\nmultiplied during the progress of the disease. It is contained in the\r\npustules, and in the excretions and exhalations of affected individuals.\r\nIt is established after a period of incubation varying from nine to\r\nthirteen days after infection.\r\n\r\nThere are two varieties of this disease, known as _confluent_ and\r\n_distinct_ variola; in the former, the vesicles run together, in the\r\nlatter, they are separate.\r\n\r\nThis fever has three stages. The first is that of _invasion_, distinctly\r\nmarked by a chill or a series of chills, which alternate with flushes of\r\nheat. In this stage the tongue becomes coated, there is also nausea and\r\nvomiting, pain in the limbs, back, and particularly in the loins, the\r\nlatter symptom being of diagnostic importance. This stage continues\r\nabout two days, and if the symptoms are light, it may be expected that\r\nthe disease will be comparatively mild, and of the _distinct_ variety.\r\n\r\n_The stage of eruption._ The eruption begins to appear on the skin,\r\ngenerally on the third day following the attack, though in the throat\r\nand mouth may be discovered round, whitish, or ashy spots, several hours\r\nprevious to the appearance of vesicles on the surface of the body. These\r\nare first seen on the face and neck, then on the trunk and upper\r\nextremities, and, lastly, on the lower extremities. The eruption at\r\nfirst appears in the form of small, red or purple spots, which change\r\nthe texture of the skin by becoming more hard, pointed, and elevated. On\r\nthe fifth day of the eruption they attain their full size, being\r\nsoftened and depressed in the center, and hence are called\r\n_umbilicated_. Now a change takes place, and the vesicles fill with\r\n\"matter\" and become pointed, and there is a rise in the fever.\r\n\r\n_The stage of suppuration_ commences thus: the pulse quickens, the skin\r\nbecomes hotter, and in many cases of the confluent variety, swelling of\r\nthe face, eyelids, and extremities occurs. Frequently there is passive\r\ndelirium in this stage, and if diarrhea sets in, it is an unfavorable\r\nsign. The duration of this stage of the eruption is four or five days.\r\n\r\n_The stage of desication_, or of the drying of the pustules, commences\r\nbetween the twelfth and fourteenth day of the disease. In the confluent\r\nvariety, patches of scab cover all the space occupied by the eruption,\r\nand the skin exhales a sickening odor.\r\n\r\nTHE TREATMENT should have reference to the determination of the eruption\r\nto the surface. If there is thirst, allow cold drinks, ice-water, or\r\nlemonade. Bathing the surface with cold water, breathing plenty of fresh\r\nair, using disinfectants in the room, and taking antiseptic medicine\r\ninternally, are proper. Add one part of carbolic acid to six parts of\r\nglycerine, mix from two to three drops of this with an ounce of water,\r\nand of this preparation administer teaspoonful doses frequently. A few\r\ndrops of carbolic acid and glycerine may be rubbed up with vaseline, and\r\nthe surface anointed with it to prevent pitting. The malady is so grave\r\nthat it should be intrusted to the care of the family physician.\r\n\r\n\r\nVARIOLOID. (MODIFIED SMALL-POX.)\r\n\r\n\r\nVarioloid is a modified form of small-pox. There is less constitutional\r\ndisturbance, and very little or no pitting of the skin. Varioloid\r\ngenerally occurs in persons who have not been fully protected by\r\nvaccination. A person suffering from this modification of the disease\r\nmay, by contagion, communicate to another genuine small-pox. The\r\n_treatment_ is the same as that recommended in variola.\r\n\r\n\r\nVACCINIA. (COW-POX.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe important discovery of vaccination is due to Dr. Jenner, who\r\nascertained that when the cow was affected by this disease and it was\r\nthen communicated to man, the affection was rendered very mild and\r\ndevoid of danger, and at the same time it proved a very complete\r\nprotection against small-pox. Like most other valuable discoveries\r\nintroduced to the world, it encountered bitter prejudice and the most\r\nunfair opposition. Now its inestimable value is generally known and\r\nadmitted.\r\n\r\nIn a few cases, in which the quality of the vaccine virus was\r\ndeteriorated, its effect is only to slightly-modify small-pox, and then\r\nthe disease resembles that caused by inoculation. The operation of\r\ninfecting the blood with the _kine virus_ is called _vaccination_. All\r\nthat we know is that when the cow becomes affected with this disease,\r\nand it is then transferred to man, it loses its severity and serves as a\r\nprotection against small-pox. In a great majority of cases this\r\nprotection is absolute, and only in a very few does it leave the subject\r\nsusceptible to small-pox, materially modified. The protection it affords\r\nagainst small-pox is found to diminish after the lapse of an indefinite\r\nnumber of years, and hence it is important to be re-vaccinated once or\r\ntwice, for instance, after an interval of five years. Between the second\r\nand third months of infancy is the best period for vaccination, and the\r\nplace usually selected is the middle of the arm above the elbow-joint.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHICKEN-POX. (VARICELLA.)\r\n\r\n\r\nChicken-pox is an eruptive disease, which affects children, and\r\noccasionally adults. It is attended with only slight constitutional\r\ndisturbance, and is, therefore, neither a distressing nor dangerous\r\naffection. The eruption first appears on the body, afterwards on the\r\nneck, the scalp, and lastly on the face. It appears on the second or\r\nthird day after the attack, and is succeeded by vesicles containing a\r\ntransparent fluid. These begin to dry on the fifth, sixth, or seventh\r\nday. This disease may be distinguished from variola and varioloid by the\r\nshortness of the period of invasion, the mildness of the symptoms, and\r\nthe absence of the deep, funnel-shaped depression of the vesicles, so\r\nnoticeable in variola.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. Ordinarily very little treatment is required. It is best to\r\nuse daily an alkaline bath, and, as a drink, the tea of pleurisy-root,\r\ncatnip, or other diaphoretics, to which may be added from one-half to\r\none teaspoonful of the Extract of Smart-weed. If the fever runs high, a\r\nfew drops of aconite in water will control it.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEASLES. (RUBEOLA.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is generally a disease of less severity and importance than the\r\nother eruptive fevers, but it is sometimes followed by serious\r\ncomplications. The stage of invasion is marked by the symptoms of a\r\ncommon cold, sneezing, watery eyes, a discharge from the nostrils, a dry\r\ncough, chilliness, and headache. This stage may last four days. Then\r\nfollows an eruption of red dots or specks, which momentarily disappear\r\non pressure. On the fourth day of the eruption the redness of the skin\r\nfades, the fever diminishes, and the vesicles dry into scales or little\r\nflakes. The eyes may be inflamed and the bowels may be quite lax at this\r\nstage.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. The great object in the treatment is to bring out the\r\neruption. To effect this, sweating teas are beneficial. The free use of\r\nthe Extract of Smart-weed is recommended, and the skin should be bathed\r\nevery day with tepid water. Sometimes when warm drinks fail to bring out\r\nthe eruption, drinking freely of cold water and keeping warmly covered\r\nin bed, will accomplish the desired result.\r\n\r\nFALSE MEASLES (_Rose Rash_) is an affection of very little importance\r\nand may be treated similarly to a case of ordinary measles.\r\n\r\n\r\nERYSIPELAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are few adult persons in this country who have not, by observation\r\nor experience, become somewhat familiar with this disease. Its\r\nmanifestations are both constitutional and local, and their intensity\r\nvaries exceedingly in different cases. The constitutional symptoms are\r\nusually the first to appear, and are of a febrile character. A distinct\r\nchill, attended by nausea and general derangement of the stomach is\r\nexperienced, followed by febrile symptoms more or less severe. There are\r\nwandering pains in the body and sometimes a passive delirium exists.\r\nSimultaneously with these symptoms the local manifestations of the\r\ndisease appear. A red spot develops on the face, the ear, or other part\r\nof the person. Its boundary is clearly marked and the affected portion\r\nslightly raised above the surrounding surface. It is characterized by a\r\nburning pain and is very sensitive to the touch. It is not necessary for\r\nthe benefit of the popular reader that we should draw a distinction\r\nbetween the different varieties of this malady. The distinctions made\r\nare founded chiefly upon the _depth_ to which the morbid condition\r\nattends, and not on any difference in the _nature of the affection_.\r\n\r\nSuppuration of the tissues involved is common in the severer forms.\r\nShould the tongue become dark and diarrhea set in, attended with great\r\nprostration, the case is very serious, and energetic means must be\r\nemployed to save life. A retrocession of the inflammation from the\r\nsurface to a vital organ is an extremely dangerous symptom. The disease\r\nis not regarded as contagious, but has been known to become epidemic.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. The treatment during the initial stage of this disease should\r\ncorrespond with the general principles laid down for the treatment of\r\nfever. The spirit vapor-bath, with warm, diaphoretic teas, or the\r\nCompound Extract of Smart-Weed may be given to favor sweating. The whole\r\nperson should be frequently bathed in warm water rendered alkaline by\r\nthe addition of saleratus or soda. The bowels should be moved by a full\r\ndose of the Purgative Pellets. Fluid extract of aconite in small and\r\nfrequent doses will best control the fever. The specific treatment,\r\nwhich should not be omitted, consists in administering doses of ten\r\ndrops of the tincture of the muriate of iron in alternation with\r\nteaspoonful doses of the Golden Medical Discovery, every three hours. As\r\na local application, the inflamed surface may be covered with cloths wet\r\nin the mucilage of slippery elm. Equal parts of sweet oil and spirits of\r\nturpentine, mixed and painted over the surface, is an application of\r\nunsurpassed efficacy.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIPHTHERIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is an exceedingly grave, constitutional disease characterized by a\r\nrapid breaking down of the powers of life, together with a peculiar\r\naffection of the throat, in which a disposition to the formation of\r\nfalse membranes is a prominent feature. The formation of these\r\nmembranes, however, is not limited to the throat, but may occur on\r\nmucous surfaces elsewhere.\r\n\r\nCAUSE. Infection with the specific germ of the disease by contagion or\r\ninoculation. It can be carried in milk or water, and the germs can\r\nattach themselves to furniture, walls, clothing, etc. A person with\r\nchronic diphtheretic sore throat can infect children or susceptible\r\npersons with the disease in its most acute type by kissing. All persons\r\nwith sore throat should avoid kissing--as this disease is commonly\r\nspread in this way.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS. The symptoms vary in different cases. In some the disease\r\ncomes on gradually, while in others it is malignant from the first. The\r\nthroat feels sore, the neck is stiff and a sense of languor, lassitude,\r\nand exhaustion pervades the system. Sometimes a chill is experienced at\r\nthe outset. Febrile disturbance, generally of a low, typhoid character,\r\nsoon manifests itself. The skin is hot; there is intense thirst; the\r\npulse is quick and feeble, ranging from 120 to 150 per minute. The\r\ntongue is generally loaded with a dirty coat, or it may be bright red.\r\nThe odor of the breath is characteristic, and peculiarly offensive, and\r\nthere is difficulty in swallowing and sometimes in breathing. Vomiting\r\nis sometimes persistent. If we examine the throat, we find more or less\r\nswelling of the tonsils and surrounding parts, which are generally\r\nbright red, and shining, and covered with a profuse, glairy, tenacious\r\nsecretion. Sometimes the parts are of a dusky, livid hue, and, in rare\r\ninstances, pallid. The false membrane, a peculiar tough exudation, soon\r\nappears and may be seen in patches, large or small, or covering the\r\nentire surface from the gums back as far as can be seen, its color\r\nvarying from a whitish yellow to a gray or dark ashen tint. When it is\r\nthrown off, it sometimes leaves a foul, ulcerating surface beneath. The\r\nprostration soon becomes extreme, and small, livid spots may appear on\r\nthe surface of the body. There may be delirium, which is, in fatal\r\ncases, succeeded by stupor, or coma. The extremities become cold;\r\ndiarrhea, and in some cases convulsions, indicate the approach of death.\r\nSometimes the patient dies before the false membrane forms.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. The extremely dangerous character of this disease demands\r\nthat the services of a skillful physician be obtained at once; and that\r\nhis efforts should be aided by the most thorough hygienic precautions,\r\ngood fresh air, bathing, and a supporting diet. Prior to the arrival of\r\nthe physician, lose no time in using plenty of good brandy or whiskey to\r\noffset the extremely weakening effect of the disease. The employment of\r\nalcoholic stimulation in this disease is almost always used by\r\nphysicians. Control the vomiting and allay the thirst by allowing the\r\npatient to suck small pieces of ice every five or ten minutes. Hot\r\nfomentations or spirits of turpentine should be applied to the throat.\r\nIf the physician does not take charge of the patient by this time, the\r\nuse of permanganate of potash, triturated, in strength of one grain to\r\nthe ounce, in a mixture of fine sugar of milk and gum acacia, and blown\r\nover the parts with an insufflater every few hours, brings the best\r\nresults if thoroughly carried out; or the throat can be swabbed out with\r\nthe following mixture: chlorate of potash, four drachms; tincture of\r\nmuriate of iron, three drachms, syrup of orange, two ounces; water\r\nsufficient to make four ounces; administered every two or three hours.\r\nInhaling steam or lime-water from a steam atomizer is especially good.\r\nThe use of blisters, caustics, active purges, mercurials, or bleeding,\r\nshould be condemned. Throughout the whole course of the disease the\r\nstrength must be supported by the most nourishing diet, as well as by\r\ntonics and stimulants. Beef tea, milk, milk punch, and brandy should be\r\nfreely administered. A competent physician should be called in as early\r\nas possible. The general results of the treatment with antitoxin, if\r\ngiven on the first, second or third day of the disease, are usually\r\nfavorable. There are rarely any immediately bad results from the\r\ninjections, and the published testimony of careful observers would tend\r\nto prove that recovery has followed its use in a larger percentage of\r\ncases than under former methods of treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUINSY. (TONSILLITIS.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is an acute inflammation of the tonsils, which generally extends\r\nto, and involves adjacent strictures, and is attended with general\r\nfebrile disturbance. Its duration varies from four to twenty days. It\r\nsometimes terminates by a gradual return to health (resolution); or by\r\nthe formation of \"matter\" within the gland (suppuration.) When this\r\nlatter is the case, the swelling sometimes becomes so great before it\r\nbreaks as to require lancing.\r\n\r\nCAUSES. It most frequently results from a cold. In some persons there is\r\na predisposition to it, and the individual is liable to recurring\r\nattacks. Persons of a scrofulous diathesis are more liable to it than\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS. Difficulty of swallowing, soreness, and stiffness of the\r\nthroat, are the first monitions of its approach. There is fever, quick,\r\nfull pulse, and dryness of the skin; the tongue is furred, and the\r\nbreath offensive. The tonsils are intensely red, swollen, and painful,\r\nthe pain often extending to the ear. Sometimes but one tonsil is\r\naffected, though generally both are involved. In severe cases the\r\npatient cannot lie down, in consequence of the difficulty of breathing.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. In the early stage of the disease, the spirit vapor-bath is\r\ninvaluable. The sweating which it produces should be kept up by the use\r\nof the Compound Extract of Smart-weed in some diaphoretic infusion. Hot\r\nwet-packs to the throat, covered with dry cloths, are useful. The\r\ninhalation of the hot vapor of water or vinegar, or peppermint and\r\nwater, is beneficial. A carthartic should be given at night. When the\r\ndisease does not show a disposition to yield to this treatment, the\r\nservices of a physician should be obtained. When pus, or \"matter,\" is\r\nformed in the tonsil, which may be known by the increased swelling and\r\nthe appearance of a yellowish spot, the services of a physician will be\r\nrequired to lance it.\r\n\r\n\r\nENLARGED TONSILS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 147.\r\n_A A._--Enlarged Tonsils. B.--Elongated\r\nUvula.]\r\n\r\nChronic enlargement of the tonsils, as shown in Fig. 147, _A A_, is an\r\nexceedingly common affection. It is most common to those of a scrofulous\r\nhabit. It rarely makes its appearance after the thirtieth year, unless\r\nit has existed in earlier life, and has been imperfectly cured. Both\r\ntonsils are generally, though unequally enlarged. A person affected with\r\nthis disease is extremely liable to sore throat, and contracts it on the\r\nslightest exposure; the contraction of a cold, suppression of\r\nperspiration, or derangement of the digestive apparatus being sufficient\r\nto provoke inflammation.\r\n\r\nCAUSES. Repeated attacks of quinsy, scarlet fever, diphtheria, or\r\nscrofula, and general impairment of the system, predispose the\r\nindividual to this disease.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS. The voice is often husky, nasal or guttural, and disagreeable.\r\nWhen the patient sleeps, a low moaning is heard, accompanied with\r\nsnoring and stentorian breathing, and the head is thrown back so as to\r\nbring the mouth on a line with the windpipe, and thus facilitate the\r\ningress of air into the lungs. When the affection becomes serious, it\r\ninterferes with breathing and swallowing. The chest is liable to become\r\nflattened in front and arched behind, in consequence of the difficulty\r\nof respiration, thus predisposing the patient to pulmonary disease. On\r\nlooking into the throat, the enlarged tonsils may be seen, as in the\r\nfigure. Sometimes they are so greatly increased in size that they touch\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. The indications to be carried out in the cure of this malady\r\nare:\r\n\r\n(1.) To remedy the constitutional derangement.\r\n\r\n(2.) To remove the enlargement of the tonsil glands.\r\n\r\nThe successful fulfillment of the first indication may be readily\r\naccomplished by attention to hygiene, diet, clothing, and the use of the\r\nGolden Medical Discovery, together with small daily doses of the\r\nPleasant Purgative Pellets. This treatment should be persevered in for a\r\nconsiderable length of time after the enlargement has disappeared, to\r\nprevent a return.\r\n\r\nTo fulfill the second indication, astringent gargles may be used.\r\nInfusions of witch-hazel or cranesbill should be used during the day.\r\nThe following mixture is unsurpassed: iodine, one drachm; iodide of\r\npotash, four drachms; pure, soft water, two ounces. Apply this\r\npreparation to the enlarged tonsils twice a day, with a probang, or soft\r\nswab, being careful to paint them each time. A persevering use of these\r\nremedies, both internal and local, is necessary to reduce and restore\r\nthe parts to a healthy condition.\r\n\r\nSometimes the enlarged tonsils undergo calcareous degeneration; in this\r\ncase, nothing but their removal by a surgical operation is effectual.\r\nThis can be readily accomplished by any competent surgeon. We have\r\noperated in a large number of cases, and have never met with any\r\nunfavorable results.\r\n\r\n\r\nELONGATION OF THE UVULA.\r\n\r\n\r\nChronic enlargement or elongation of the uvula, or palate, as shown at\r\nB, Fig. 147, may arise from the same causes as enlargement of the\r\ntonsils. It subjects the individual to a great deal of annoyance by\r\ndropping into and irritating the throat. It causes tickling and frequent\r\ndesire to clear the throat, change, weakness, or entire loss of voice,\r\nand difficulty of breathing, frequently giving rise to the most\r\npersistent and aggravating cough.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. The treatment already laid down for enlarged tonsils, with\r\nwhich affection, elongation of the uvula is so often associated, is\r\ngenerally effectual. When it has existed for a long time and does not\r\nyield to this treatment, it may be removed by any competent surgeon.\r\n\r\n\r\nANÆMIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the blood contains less than the ordinary number of red corpuscles,\r\nthe condition is known as _anæmia_, and is characterized by every sign\r\nof debility. A copious hemorrhage, in consequence of a cut, or other\r\nserious injury, will lessen the quantity of blood and may produce\r\nanæmia. After sudden blood-letting, the volume of the circulation is\r\nquickly restored by absorption of fluid, but the red corpuscles cannot\r\nbe so readily replaced, so that the blood is poorer by being more\r\nwatery. This is only one way in which the blood is impoverished.\r\n\r\nThe blood may be exhausted by a drain upon the system, in consequence of\r\nhard and prolonged study. Severe mental employment consumes the red\r\ncorpuscles, leaving the blood thin, the skin cool and pale, and the\r\nextremities moist and cold.\r\n\r\nAnæmia may arise from lack of exercise, or it may be occasioned by\r\nmental depression, anxiety, disappointment, trouble, acute excitement of\r\nthe emotions or passions, spinal irritation; in fact, there are many\r\nspecial relations existing between the red corpuscles of the blood and\r\nthe various states of the mind and the nervous system. The latter\r\ndepends directly upon the health and quantity of these red corpuscles\r\nfor its ability to execute its functions.\r\n\r\nAnæmia may arise in consequence of low diet, or because the alimentary\r\norgans do not properly digest the food, or when there is not sufficient\r\nvariety in the diet. No matter how anæmia is occasioned, whether by\r\nlabor and expenditure, by hemorrhages, lead poisoning, prolonged\r\nexposure to miasmatic influences, deprivation of food, indigestion,\r\nimperfect assimilation, frequent child-bearing, or lactation, the number\r\nof the red corpuscles in the blood is materially diminished.\r\n\r\nThe diagnostic symptoms of anæmia are pallor of the face, lips, tongue,\r\nand general surface, weakness of the vital organs, hurried respiration\r\non slight exercise, swelling or puffiness of the eyes, and a murmur of\r\nthe heart, resembling the sound of a bellows.\r\n\r\nThis disorder of the blood tends to develop low inflammation, dropsical\r\neffusion, tubercular deposits, Bright's disease, derangements of the\r\nliver, diarrhea, leucorrhea, and is a precursor of low, protracted\r\nfevers. This condition of the blood predisposes to the development of\r\nother affections, providing they are in existence, and often it is found\r\nassociated with Bright's disease, cancer, and lung difficulties.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. (1.) Prevent all unnecessary waste and vital expenditure.\r\n\r\n(2.) Place the patient under favorable circumstances for recovery, by\r\nregulating the exercise and clothing entertaining the mind, and\r\nfurnishing plenty of pure air.\r\n\r\n(3.) Prescribe such a nutritious diet as will agree with the enfeebled\r\ncondition of the patient.\r\n\r\n(4.) Regular habits should be established in regard to meals, exercise,\r\nrecreation, rest, and sleep.\r\n\r\n(5.) The use of tonics and stimulants, as much as the stomach will bear,\r\nshould be encouraged. Bathe the surface with a solution of a drachm of\r\nquinine in a pint of whiskey.\r\n\r\n(6.) Iron, in some form, is the special internal remedy in anæmia.\r\nMeantime, it is proper to treat the patient with gentle, manual\r\nfriction, rubbing the surface of the body lightly and briskly with the\r\nwarm, dry hand, which greatly stimulates the circulation of the blood.\r\nAnæmia occurs more frequently in the female than in the male, because\r\nher functions and duties are more likely to give rise to it.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPNOEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nApnoea, or short, hurried, difficult respiration, is occasioned by\r\ncertain conditions of the blood. When anything interferes with the\r\nabsorption of oxygen, or the elimination of carbonic acid, the blood is\r\nnot changed from venous to arterial, and becomes incapable of sustaining\r\nlife. This morbid condition is termed _asphyxia_. We often read of\r\npersons going into wells where there are noxious gases, or remaining in\r\na close room where there are live coals generating carbonic acid gas and\r\nthus becoming asphyxiated, dying for want of oxygen.\r\n\r\nDeficiency of oxygen is the cause of apnoea, and sometimes the red\r\ncorpuscles themselves are so few, worn out, or destroyed, that they\r\ncannot carry sufficient oxygen, and the consequence is that the patient\r\nbecomes short of breath, and when a fatal degeneration of the corpuscles\r\nensues, he dies of asphyxia. Many a child grows thin and wan and\r\ncontinues to waste away, the parents little dreaming that the slow\r\nconsumption of the red corpuscles of the blood is the cause which is\r\nundermining the health. Sometimes this disease is the result of\r\nstarvation, irregular feeding, improper diet, want of care, and, at\r\nother times, want of fresh air, proper exercise, and sunlight.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. The first essential to success in the treatment of this\r\ndisease, is the removal of the exciting cause. Exercise in the outdoor\r\nair and sunlight, with good, nutritious food, and well-ventilated\r\nsleeping apartments, are of the greatest importance. The bitter tonics,\r\nas hydrastin, with pyrophosphate of iron, should be employed to enrich\r\nthe blood and build up the strength.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEUCOCYTHÆMIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis term is used to designate a condition in which there is an excess\r\nof colorless blood-corpuscles. In health, the colorless corpuscles\r\nshould exist only in the proportion of one, to one or two hundred of the\r\nred corpuscles. These colorless corpuscles increase when there is\r\ndisease of the lymphatic glands, but whether this is the cause of their\r\nincrease or perversion is not known.\r\n\r\nThey have been found abundant in the blood in diseases of the spleen and\r\nof the liver. Diarrhea usually attends this complaint, together with\r\ndifficult breathing, loss of strength, gradual decline, fever,\r\ndiminution of vital forces, and finally death. The recovery of a\r\nwell-marked case of this disease is very doubtful. Its average duration\r\nis about one year.\r\n\r\n\r\nDROPSIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Transudation_ is the passage of fluid through the tissue of any part of\r\nthe body without changing its liquid state, while _exudation_ means,\r\nmedically, the passage of matter which coagulates and gives rise to\r\nsolid deposits. When transudations are unhealthy, they may accumulate in\r\nserous cavities or in cellular structures, and constitute _dropsy_.\r\nExudation is the result of inflammation, and the product effused\r\ncoagulates and becomes the seat of a new growth of tissue. Exosmosis\r\nmeans the passage of fluid from within outward, and is a process\r\nconstantly taking place in health; while transudation takes place\r\nbecause the blood is watery and the tissues are feeble and permeable,\r\npermitting the serum and watery elements of the blood to pass into\r\ncertain cavities, where they accumulate.\r\n\r\nThe cause of dropsies may be low diet, insufficient exercise,\r\nindigestion, hemorrhages, wasting diseases, in fact, any thing which\r\nimpoverishes the blood and increases the relative amount of serum. The\r\ntardy circulation of blood in the veins, or its obstruction in any way,\r\nis a condition highly favorable to the development of dropsy.\r\n\r\nGeneral dropsy is called _anasarca_, and is readily distinguished by\r\nbloating or puffiness of the skin all over the body. This condition is\r\nalso called _oedema_. The skin is pale, yields under the finger without\r\npain, and preserves the impression for some time. The oedema usually\r\nappears first in the lower extremities, next in the face, and from\r\nthence extends over the body.\r\n\r\nGeneral dropsy is commonly due to an impoverished condition of the\r\nblood, and this may be the result of _albuminuria_, a disease of the\r\nkidneys. Albuminuria is frequently the sequel of scarlatina. Hence, the\r\nutmost care should be taken against exposure of a patient recovering\r\nfrom scarlatina, and the same caution should be exercised during\r\nconvalescence from measles, erysipelas, and rheumatism. Dropsies may be\r\ngeneral, as in anasarca, or local, as dropsy of the heart, called\r\n_cardiac_ dropsy: dropsy of the peritoneum, the serous membrane which\r\nlines the abdominal cavity, called _ascites_; dropsy of the chest,\r\ncalled _hydrothorax_; dropsy of the head, called _hydrocephalus_; dropsy\r\nof the scrotum, called _hydrocele_.\r\n\r\nDropsy is not, therefore, of itself a disease, but only the symptom of a\r\nmorbid condition of the blood, kidneys, liver, or heart. Thus disease of\r\nthe valves of the heart, may obstruct the free flow of blood and thus\r\nretard its circulution. In consequence the pulse grows small and weak,\r\nand the patient cannot exercise or labor as usual, and finally the lower\r\nlimbs begin to swell, then the face and body, the skin looks dusky, the\r\nappetite is impaired, the kidneys become diseased, there is difficulty\r\nin breathing, and the patient, it is said, dies of dropsy, yet dropsy\r\nwas the result of a disease of the heart, which retarded the circulation\r\nand enfeebled the system, and which was actually the primary cause of\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. Dropsy being only a symptom of various morbid conditions\r\nexisting in the system, any treatment to be radically beneficial must,\r\ntherefore, have reference to the diseased conditions upon which the\r\ndropsical effusion, in each individual case, depends. These are so\r\nvarious, and frequently so obscure, as to require the best diagnostic\r\nskill possessed by the experienced specialist, to detect them. There\r\nare, however, a few general principles which are applicable to the\r\ntreatment of nearly all cases of dropsy. Nutritious diet, frequent\r\nalkaline baths to keep the skin in good condition and favor excretion\r\nthrough its pores, and a general hygienic regulation of the daily\r\nhabits, are of the greatest importance. There are also a few general\r\nremedies which may prove more or less beneficial in nearly all cases. We\r\nrefer to diuretics and hydragogue cathartics. The object sought in the\r\nadministration of these is the evacuation of the accumulated fluids\r\nthrough the kidneys and bowels, thus giving relief. Of the diuretics,\r\nqueen of the meadow, buchu, and digitalis generally operate well. As a\r\ncathartic, the Purgative Pellets accompanied with a teaspoonful or two\r\nof cream of tartar, will prove serviceable. Beyond these general\r\nprinciples of treatment it would be useless for us to attempt to advise\r\nthe invalid suffering from any one of the many forms of dropsy. The\r\nspecialist skilled by large experience in detecting the exact morbid\r\ncondition which causes the watery effusion and accumulation, can select\r\nhis remedies to meet the peculiar indications presented by each\r\nindividual case. Sometimes the removal of the watery accumulation by\r\ntapping becomes necessary, in order to afford relief and give time for\r\nremedies to act. We have found it necessary to perform this operation\r\nvery frequently in cases of _hydrocele_, and also quite often in cases\r\nof abdominal dropsy. The chest has also been tapped and considerable\r\nquantities of fluids drawn off, and this has been followed by prompt\r\nimprovement and a final cure.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASES TREATED.\r\n\r\n     CASE I. A Canadian gentleman, aged 68, applied at the Invalids\r\n     Hotel and Surgical Institute, for examination and treatment.\r\n     He had been dropsical for over two years, and had become so\r\n     badly affected as to be unable to lie down at night. His legs\r\n     were so filled with water and enlarged as to render it almost\r\n     impossible for him to walk, and there was a general anasarca.\r\n     The least exertion was attended with the greatest difficulty\r\n     of breathing. He had been under the treatment of several\r\n     eminent general practitioners of medicine in Canada but found\r\n     no relief. They were unable to discover the real cause of his\r\n     ailment, but to the specialist who has charge of this class of\r\n     diseases at our institution, and who annually examines and\r\n     treats hundreds of such cases, it was at once apparent that\r\n     the dropsy was caused from a weakened condition of the heart,\r\n     which rendered it unable to perform its functions. He was put\r\n     upon a tonic and alterative course of treatment, which also\r\n     embraced the use of such medicines as have been found to exert\r\n     a specific, tonic action upon the muscular tissues of the\r\n     heart. He improved so rapidly that in less than two months he\r\n     was able to lie down and sleep soundly all night. The bloating\r\n     disappeared, his strength improved, and in three month's more\r\n     he was discharged perfectly cured.\r\n\r\n     CASE II. A man aged 42, consulted us by letter, stating that\r\n     he was troubled with general bloating which had made its\r\n     appearance gradually and was attended by general debility and\r\n     other symptoms which have been enumerated as common to general\r\n     dropsy. He had been under the treatment of several home\r\n     physicians without receiving any benefit; he had steadily\r\n     grown worse until he felt satisfied that if he did not soon\r\n     get relief he could not live very long. He was requested to\r\n     send a sample of his urine for examination, as we had\r\n     suspicions, from the symptoms which he gave, that the cause of\r\n     his dropsy was _albuminuria_, or Bright's disease of the\r\n     kidneys. On examination of the urine, albumen in very\r\n     perceptible quantities was found to be present. We had, about\r\n     this time, come into possession of a remedy said by very good\r\n     authority, to be a specific in degeneration of the kidneys\r\n     when not too far advanced, and we determined to test it upon\r\n     this well-marked case. We accordingly prescribed it, together\r\n     with other proper tonics and alteratives, at the same time\r\n     giving the patient important hygienic advice, which must be\r\n     complied with if success is attained in the management of this\r\n     very fatal malady. Our patient gradually improved, and in a\r\n     few months' time was restored to perfect health, which he has\r\n     continued to enjoy ever since. From our subsequent experience,\r\n     embracing the treatment of quite a large number of cases of\r\n     Bright's disease of the kidneys, we are satisfied that it is,\r\n     in its early stage, quite amenable to treatment.\r\n\r\n     CASE III. A man aged 35, single, consulted us for what he\r\n     supposed to be enlargement of the testicles. The scrotum was\r\n     as large as his head, and it was with difficulty that he could\r\n     conceal the deformity from general observation. The disease\r\n     was immediately recognized by the attending surgeon as\r\n     hydrocele. The liquid was promptly drawn oft by tapping, and a\r\n     stimulating injection was made into the scrotum to prevent\r\n     re-accumulation. We mention this case only because it is one\r\n     among a very large number who have consulted us supposing that\r\n     they were suffering from enlargement of the testicles, cancer,\r\n     or some other morbid growth within the scrotum, when a slight\r\n     examination has shown the affection to be hydrocele, a disease\r\n     which is speedily cured by tapping, with a little after\r\n     treatment. The operation is perfectly safe and almost entirely\r\n     painless.\r\n\r\n     CASE IV. A lady, aged 24, consulted us by letter enumerating a\r\n     long list of symptoms which clearly indicated abdominal\r\n     dropsy, resulting from suppression of the menses. A\r\n     well-regulated, hygienic treatment was advised, and medicines\r\n     to restore the menstrual function by gradually toning up and\r\n     regulating the whole system, were forwarded to her by express.\r\n     After four months' treatment, perfect recovery resulted. Cases\r\n     like this latter are very common and generally yield quite\r\n     readily to proper management. No harsh or forcing treatment\r\n     for restoring the menstrual function should be employed, as it\r\n     will not only fail to accomplish the object sought, but it is\r\n     also sure to seriously and irreparably injure the system. The\r\n     most difficult cases which we have had to deal with, have been\r\n     those which had been subjected by other physicians to the\r\n     administration of strong emmenagogues in the vain effort to\r\n     bring on the menses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRHEUMATISM.\r\n\r\n\r\nProminent among constitutional diseases is the one known as\r\n_rheumatism_. It is characterized by certain local symptoms or\r\nmanifestations in fibrous tissues. This term has been applied to\r\nneuralgic affections and to _gout_, but it differs from each in several\r\nessential particulars. Rheumatism may be divided into (1) _Acute_, (2)\r\n_Chronic_, (3) _Muscular_.\r\n\r\nACUTE ARTICULAR RHEUMATISM. Acute articular rheumatism implies an\r\naffection of the articulations or joints. It usually commences suddenly;\r\nsometimes pain or soreness in the joints precedes the disclosure of the\r\ndisease. The symptoms are pain in the joints, tenderness, increased\r\nheat, swelling and redness of the skin. The pain varies in its intensity\r\nin different oases, and is increased by the movement of the affected\r\nparts. Swelling of the joints occurs, especially those of the knee,\r\nankle, wrist, elbow, and the smaller joints of the hands and feet. The\r\nswelling and redness are generally in proportion to the acuteness of the\r\nattack. Acute articular rheumatism is always accompanied with more or\r\nless fever. Sweating is generally a prominent symptom, being strongly\r\nacid and more profuse during the night. The appetite is impaired, the\r\ntongue is coated, the bowels are constipated, or there is diarrhea.\r\n\r\nTHE DURATION OF THIS DISEASE. Unlike fevers, its course is marked by\r\nfluctuations; frequently after a few days the pain subsides, the fever\r\ndisappears, and convalescence is apparently established, when, suddenly,\r\nall the symptoms are renewed with even greater intensity than before.\r\nThis disease rarely proves fatal, unless the heart is involved.\r\n\r\nCAUSES. Rheumatism is frequently supposed to be occasioned by a\r\nsuppression of the functions of the skin, and is generally attributed to\r\nthe action of cold upon the surface of the body. But this acts only as\r\nan exciting cause. It is a disease of the blood. This form of rheumatism\r\nusually occurs between the age of fifteen and thirty, and prevails most\r\nextensively in changeable climates. Acute articular rheumatism seldom\r\nterminates in the chronic form.\r\n\r\nCHRONIC ARTICULAR RHEUMATISM. Articular rheumatism, in the subacute or\r\nchronic form, is frequently observed in medical practice. The symptoms\r\nare pain and more or less swelling of the joints, although not of as\r\ngrave a character as in acute rheumatism. There is frequently an absence\r\nof increased heat and redness. As in the acute form, the different\r\njoints are liable to be affected successively and irregularly, until,\r\nafter a time, the disease becomes fixed in a single joint, and the\r\nfibrous tissues entering into the ligaments and tendons are liable to be\r\naffected. The appetite, digestion, and nutrition are often good, and, in\r\nmild cases, patients are able to pursue their daily vocations. The\r\ndisease is supposed to be the same as in the acute form, but milder,\r\nand, strange to say, more persistent. A diseased condition of the blood\r\nis supposed to be involved in both instances, but this morbid state is\r\nless extended, and, at the same time, more obstinate in the chronic than\r\nin the acute form. Sub-acute articular rheumatism is not always chronic,\r\nand may disappear in a shorter time than in the acute form. Chronic\r\narticular rheumatism is not generally fatal, but there is danger of\r\npermanent deformities.\r\n\r\nMUSCULAR RHEUMATISM. This affection is closely allied to _neuralgia_,\r\nand may properly be called _myalgia_. It exists under two forms, acute\r\nand chronic. In acute muscular rheumatism, there is at first a dull pain\r\nin the muscles, which gradually increases. When the affected muscles are\r\nnot used the pain is slight, and certain positions may be assumed\r\nwithout inducing it constantly; but in movements which involve\r\ncontraction of the muscles the pain is very violent. In some cases, the\r\ndisease is movable, changing from one muscle to another, but usually it\r\nremains fixed in the muscle first attacked. The appetite and digestion\r\nare not often impaired, and there is no fever. The duration of this form\r\nof rheumatism varies from a few hours to a week or more.\r\n\r\nIn subacute or chronic muscular rheumatism, pain is excited only when\r\nthe affected muscles are contracted with unusual force, and then it is\r\nsimilar to that experienced in the acute form. The chronic form is more\r\napt to change its position than the acute. The duration of this form is\r\nindefinite. In both the acute and chronic forms some particular parts of\r\nthe body are more subject to the affection than others.\r\n\r\nThe muscles on the posterior part of the _neck_ are subject to rheumatic\r\naffection. It is termed _torticollis_ or _cervical_ rheumatism in such\r\ncases, and should be distinguished from ordinary neuralgia. When the\r\nmuscles of the loins are affected, it is commonly known as _lumbago_. In\r\ncase the thoracic muscles are affected, it is known as _pleurodynia_. In\r\ncoughing, sneezing, and the like, the pain produced is not unlike that\r\nin pleuritis and intercostal neuralgia.\r\n\r\nOne of the most marked features of muscular rheumatism, is the\r\ncramp-like pain, induced by the movements of the affected muscles,\r\nwhereas the pain is slight when those muscles are uncontracted. This\r\nfeature is very serviceable in distinguishing muscular rheumatism, or\r\nmyalgia, from neuralgic affections. Another trait which distinguishes\r\nmuscular rheumatism from neuralgia, is that the former is characterized\r\nby great soreness, while the latter is not. There is also a distinction\r\nbetween inflammation of the muscles and muscular rheumatism. In the case\r\nof the former, there is continued pain, swelling of the parts,\r\noccasional redness, and the presence of more or less fever, which\r\nconditions do not exist in the latter. Persons subject to rheumatism of\r\nthe muscles, are apt to suffer from an attack, after exposure of the\r\nbody to a draught of air during sleep, or when in a state of\r\nperspiration.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF ACUTE RHEUMATISM. Administer the spirit vapor-bath to\r\nproduce free perspiration, which should be maintained by full doses of\r\nthe Compound Extract of Smart-weed. The anodyne properties of the latter\r\nalso prove very valuable in allaying the pain. Tincture or fluid extract\r\nof aconite root may also be employed, to assist in equalizing the\r\ncirculation, and also to secure its anodyne action. Black cohosh seems\r\nto exert a specific and salutary influence in this disease, and the\r\ntincture or fluid extract of the root of this plant may be\r\nadvantageously combined with the aconite. Take fluid extract of\r\naconite-root, thirty drops; fluid extract of black cohosh, one drachm;\r\nwater, fifteen teaspoonfuls; mix. The dose is one teaspoonful every\r\nhour. The whole person should be frequently bathed with warm water,\r\nrendered alkaline by the addition of saleratus or soda. The painful\r\njoints may be packed with wool or with cloths wrung from the hot\r\nsaleratus water, and the patient kept warm and quiet in bed. The acetate\r\nof potash taken in doses of five grains, well diluted with water, every\r\nthree or four hours, is very valuable in acute rheumatism. Its alkaline\r\nqualities tend to neutralize the acid condition of the fluids of the\r\nsystem, and it also possesses diuretic properties which act upon the\r\nkidneys, removing the offending blood-poison from the system through\r\nthese organs. If the joints are very painful, cloths wet with the\r\nCompound Extract of Smart-weed and applied to them, and covered with hot\r\nfomentations, very frequently relieve the suffering. The majority of\r\ncases yield quite promptly to the course of treatment already advised,\r\nif it is persevered in. The disease, however, sometimes proves obstinate\r\nand resists for many days the best treatment yet known to the medical\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF CHRONIC RHEUMATISM. The general alkaline baths recommended\r\nin the acute affection are also valuable in the chronic. The spirit\r\nvapor-bath, the Turkish, as well as the sulphur vapor-bath, are all\r\nworthy of a trial in this obstinate and painful disease. Alternatives\r\nare a very valuable class of agents in chronic rheumatism. The following\r\nmixture, in teaspoonful doses three times a day, in alternation with the\r\nGolden Medical Discovery, has proved very successful in this disease:\r\nacetate of potash, one ounce; fluid extract of black cohosh, one ounce;\r\nfluid extract of poison hemlock, two drachms; simple syrup, six ounces.\r\nThis thorough alterative course, if well persevered in, together with\r\nthe use of alkaline and vapor-baths, will generally prove very\r\nsuccessful. The specialist, however, dealing with chronic diseases\r\nexclusively, will occasionally meet with a case which has been the\r\nrounds of the home physicians without benefit, that will tax his skill\r\nand require the exercise of all his perceptive faculties to determine\r\nthe exact condition of the patient's system, upon which the obstinacy of\r\nthe disease depends. When this is ascertained, the remedies will\r\nnaturally suggest themselves, and the malady will generally yield to\r\nthem. But, although the treatment of this disease has entered largely\r\ninto our practice at the Invalid's Hotel, and has been attended by the\r\nmost happy results, yet the cases have presented so great a diversity of\r\nabnormal features, and have required so many variations in the course of\r\ntreatment, to be met successfully, that we frankly acknowledge our\r\ninability to so instruct the unprofessional reader as to enable him to\r\ndetect the various systemic faults common to this ever-varying disease,\r\nand adjust remedies to them, so as to make the treatment uniformly\r\nsuccessful. If the several plans of treatment which we have given do not\r\nconquer the disease, we can not better advise the invalid than to\r\nrecommend him to employ a physician of well-known skill in the treatment\r\nof chronic diseases. If such a one is not accessible for personal\r\nconsultation, a careful statement of all the prominent symptoms, in\r\nwriting, may be forwarded to a specialist of large experience in this\r\ndisease, who will readily detect the real fault, in which the ailment\r\nhas its foundation. Particularly easy will it be for him to do so, if he\r\nbe an expert in the analysis of urine. A vial of that which is first\r\npassed in the morning, should be sent with the history of the case, as\r\nchronic rheumatism effects characteristic changes in this excretion,\r\nwhich clearly and unmistakably indicate the abnormal condition of the\r\nfluids of the body upon which the disease depends.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE SKIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nECZEMATOUS AFFECTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nEczematous affections constitute a very important class of skin\r\ndiseases, the prominent characteristics of which are _eruption_ and\r\n_itching_. They are progressive in character, passing through all the\r\nsuccessive stages of development, from mere redness of the skin to\r\ndesquamation, or thickening of the cuticle. The affections belonging to\r\nthis group are _eczema, psoriasis, pityriasis, lichen, impetigo, gutta\r\nrosacea,_ and _scabies_, or _itch_. A careful examination of each of\r\nthese diseases shows it to be a modified form of eczema, and, therefore,\r\nthey demand similar treatment.\r\n\r\nECZEMA. (_Humid Tetter, Salt-rheum, Running Scall_, or _Heat Eruption_.)\r\nThe term _eczema_ is used to designate the commonest kind of skin\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\nIn this disease, the minute blood-vessels are congested causing the skin\r\nto be more vascular and redder than in its natural state. There is an\r\nitching or smarting in the affected parts. The skin is raised in the\r\nform of little pimples or vesicles, and a watery lymph exudes. Sometimes\r\nthe skin becomes detached and is replaced by a crust of hardened lymph,\r\nor it may be partially reproduced, forming _squamæ_, or scales. There\r\nare three stages of this disease; the inflammatory, accompanied by\r\nswelling, and the formation of pimples or vesicles; that of exudation,\r\nwhich is succeeded by incrustation; and that of desquamation, in which\r\nthe skin separates in little scales and sometimes becomes thickened.\r\nRarely, if ever, does the disease pass through these successive stages,\r\nbut it is modified by its location and the temperament of the patient.\r\n\r\nThe many varieties of eczema are designated according to their\r\npredominating characteristics. Thus, when pimples or vesicles are\r\nabundant, it is termed, respectively, _eczema papulosum_ and _eczema\r\nvesiculosum,_ a fine illustration of which may be seen in Colored Plate\r\nI, Fig. 1. Again, when characterized by the eruption of pustules, it is\r\ntermed _eczema pustulosum_, a representation of which may be seen in\r\nPlate I, Fig. 2; and, when the prominent feature is the formation of\r\nscales, it is termed _eczema squamosum_.\r\n\r\nEczema may be general or partial; in other words, the eruption may\r\nappear in patches or be distributed over the entire surface of the body.\r\nThe latter form often appears in infants, but rarely occurs in adults.\r\nTwo or more varieties of the eruption may be associated, or one form may\r\ngradually develop into another.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate I.\r\nFig. 1. Fig. 2. Fig. 3. Fig. 4. Fig. 5.]\r\n\r\nInfants and young children are peculiarly subject to this disorder, and,\r\nif the disease be not promptly arrested, it will assume the severest\r\nform and eventually become chronic. The muscles are soft, the eyes are\r\ndull and expressionless, and the little sufferer experiences the most\r\nexcruciating torments. Frequently the whole body is covered with patches\r\nof eczema, the secretions are arrested, and, where the scales fall off,\r\nthe skin is left dry and feverish.\r\n\r\nEczema has no symptoms proper, since the morbid feelings are due to\r\nconstitutional debility, of which eczema is the result. The _signs_ of\r\neczema are redness, heat, an itching or smarting sensation, the\r\nformation of pimples or vesicles, exudation, incrustation, the\r\nseparation of the cuticle into scales and a gradual thickening of the\r\nskin.\r\n\r\nCAUSES. Three forms of constitutional derangement predispose the system\r\nto eczema; nutritive, assimilative, and nervous debility. In the former,\r\nthere is a diminution of nutritive power, so that the patient becomes\r\nweak and emaciated. Assimilative debility is indicated by an impaired\r\ndigestion and a consequent suppression, or an abnormal state of the\r\nsecretions. Eczema occasioned by nervous debility, is accompanied by all\r\nthe morbid conditions incident to irritation and exhaustion of the\r\nnervous system. Eczema may be excited by a violation of the rules of\r\nhygiene, as undue exposure, or sudden transition from heat to cold,\r\ndeficient or excessive exercise, impure air, or improper clothing.\r\n\r\nPSORIASIS. Psoriasis may be defined as a _chronic form of eczema_. The\r\ntransition of the last stage of eczema into psoriasis is indicated by a\r\ntendency of the inflamed, thickened, scaly skin to become moist when\r\nrubbed. It usually appears in patches on various portions of the body.\r\nThe skin is parched and highly discolored. The hairs are harsh and\r\nscanty. The patient is constantly tormented by an unbearable itching\r\nsensation and, if the skin is rubbed, it exudes a viscous or sticky\r\nfluid. These are the characteristic signs of psoriasis. It generally\r\nappears on the flexures, folds and crooks of the joints, the backs and\r\npalms of the hands, the arms, and the lower portions of the legs.\r\n\r\nPITYRIASIS. (_Branny Tetter_, or _Dandruff_.) This affection is a mild\r\nform of psoriasis, from which it may be distinguished by a more\r\nsuperficial congestion or inflammation of the affected parts, the\r\nabsence of swelling, and the formation of smaller scales, having the\r\nform and appearance of _fine bran_. It generally appears on the scalp,\r\nsometimes extends over the face, and, in rare instances, affects the\r\nentire surface of the body. The signs peculiar to this disease are\r\nslight inflammation, itching, and the formation of minute scales.\r\n\r\nCAUSES. Pityriasis is caused by nutritive debility, and is often\r\nassociated with erysipelas, rheumatism, and bronchitis.\r\n\r\nLICHEN. (_Papular Rash_.) Lichen is a term used to designate an eruption\r\nof minute conical pimples, which are more or less transparent, red, and\r\noccasion great annoyance. The eruption is attended with a severe, hot,\r\nprickling sensation, as if the flesh were punctured with hot needles.\r\nThe pimples contain no pus, but if opened, they exude a small quantity\r\nof blood and serum. This disease more frequently occurs between the ages\r\nof twelve and fifty, but occasionally appears during dentition, when it\r\nis called \"tooth rash.\" The lichen pimples are sometimes dispersed\r\nsingly over the skin and gradually subside, forming a minute scale,\r\ncorresponding in position with the summit of the pimple. When the\r\npimples appear in clusters, there is a diffused redness in the affected\r\npart, and, if they are irritated, minute scabs will be formed. Lichen\r\ngenerally appears on the upper portion of the body, as on the face,\r\narms, hands, back, and chest.\r\n\r\nThe various forms of lichen are designated according to their causes,\r\nsigns, location, manner of distribution, and the form of the pimples.\r\n\r\n_Lichen Simplex_ is the simplest form of this disorder, and is indicated\r\nby the appearance of minute pimples, which, when the distribution is\r\ngeneral, are arranged like the blotches of measles. Sometimes the\r\neruption is local and bounded by the limits of an article of clothing,\r\nas at the waist. In eight or ten days, the cuticle separates into minute\r\nscales, which are detached and thrown off; but a new crop of pimples\r\nsoon appears and runs the same course, only to be succeeded by another,\r\nand thus the affection continues for months and even years.\r\n\r\n_Lichen circumscriptus_ is an aggravated form of _lichen simplex_, and\r\nis characterized by a circular arrangement of the pimples. The\r\ncircumference which marks the limit of the patch is sharply defined.\r\nThis form of lichen usually appears on the chest, hips, or limbs, and is\r\nnot unfrequently mistaken for ringworm.\r\n\r\n_Lichen strophulosus_ is a variety peculiar to infants. Dermatologists\r\nrecognize several subdivisions of this species, but the general\r\ncharacteristics are the same in all. The pimples are much larger than in\r\nthe other forms of lichen, of a vivid red color and the duration of the\r\neruption is limited to two or three weeks.\r\n\r\n_Lichen urticatus_ is also an infantile affection and begins with\r\ninflammation, which is soon succeeded by the eruption. In a few days the\r\npimples shrink, the redness disappears, and the skin has a peculiar\r\nbleached appearance. The eruption is attended by an intense itching\r\nsensation and, if the skin is ruptured, a small quantity of blood is\r\ndischarged and a black scab formed. This variety of lichen is very\r\nobstinate and of long duration.\r\n\r\n_Lichen tropicus_, popularly known as _prickly heat_, is an affection\r\nwhich attacks Europeans in hot climates. It is characterized by the\r\nappearance of numerous red pimples of an irregular form, distributed\r\nover those portions of the body usually covered by the clothing. It is\r\nattended with a fierce, burning, itching sensation, which is aggravated\r\nby warm drinks, friction of the clothing, and the heat of the bed. The\r\neruption indicates a healthy condition of the system; its suppression or\r\nretrocession is an unfavorable symptom, denoting some internal affection\r\nsuch as deranged nutrition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate II.\r\nFig. 6. Fig. 7.\r\nFig. 8. Fig. 9.\r\nFig. 10. Fig. 11.\r\nFig. 12. Fig. 13.]\r\n\r\nIn _lichen planus_, as the term indicates, the pimples are flattened.\r\nThere is no sensation of itching or formation of scabs. The pimples are\r\nsolitary and have an angular base, and the fresh pimples formed appear\r\non the spaces between the former eruptions. This affection usually\r\nattacks some particular region, such as the abdomen, hips, or chest.\r\nInstances are recorded in which it has appeared on the tongue and the\r\nlining membrane of the mouth. Sometimes it appears in patches, but even\r\nthen, the margin of each pimple can be discerned.\r\n\r\n_Lichen pilaris_ and _lividus_ are modifications of lichen simplex, the\r\nformer being so named to describe the location of the pimples, _i.e._,\r\nsurrounding the minute hairs which cover the body, especially the lower\r\nlimbs. The term _lichen lividus_ indicates the dark purplish hue caused\r\nby a torpid circulation and the consequent change of arterial into\r\nvenous blood before leaving the pimples. _Lichen circinatus_ is a\r\nmodified form of _lichen circumspectus_. The pimples in the center of\r\nthe circular patch subside and a ring is formed which gradually\r\nincreases in size. When the rings become broken or extend in regular\r\nforms, the affection is termed _lichen gyratus_.\r\n\r\nCAUSES. Constitutional debility predisposes the system to this eruption.\r\nThe exciting causes are irritation of the skin, strumous diathesis,\r\ndentition, and any violation of hygienic rules. Although lichen is not a\r\nfatal disease, yet it tends to reduce the vitality of the system.\r\n\r\nIMPETIGO. (_Crusted Tetter_ or _Scall_.) Impetigo is a term applied to\r\nan inflammation of the skin, more severe and energetic in its character\r\nthan the preceding affection. We have found the predominating\r\ncharacteristics of eczema and lichen to be the presence of exudation in\r\nthe former, and the absence of it in the latter.\r\n\r\nImpetigo is marked by the formation of yellow pus, which raises the\r\ncuticle into pustules. There is a slight swelling, redness, and the pus\r\ngradually dries up, forming an amber-colored crust, a representation of\r\nwhich is given in Colored Plate I, Fig. 5. It soon falls, leaving the\r\nskin slightly inflammed, but with no scar. The pustules are sometimes\r\nsurrounded by a cluster of smaller ones.\r\n\r\nThe varieties of impetigo are designated according to the distribution\r\nof the pustules. _Impetigo figurata_, is characterized by the appearance\r\nof large clusters upon an inflamed and swollen surface, generally upon\r\nthe face, but sometimes upon the scalp. This form is represented in\r\nColored Plate I, Fig. 4. In _impetigo sparsa_ the pustules are scattered\r\nover the whole body.\r\n\r\nCAUSES. The predisposing cause of impetigo is nutritive debility, and\r\nthe exciting causes are irritation, impure air, and errors of diet.\r\n\r\nGUTTA ROSACEA is a _progressive_ disease, and its successive stages of\r\ndevelopment mark the several varieties, such as _gutta rosacea,\r\nerythematosa, papulosa, tuberculosa, pustulosa_, according as they are\r\ncharacterized by redness, pimples, tubercles, or pustules. This\r\naffection is attended with heat, itching, and throbbing. The pustules\r\ncontain serous lymph, which exudes if the cuticle be broken, and forms a\r\ncrust at the summit of the pustule.\r\n\r\nThis eruption often appears on the face of persons addicted to\r\nintemperate habits, and has thus received the name of \"_rum blossom_.\"\r\n\r\nCAUSE. It is essentially a chronic affection, and depends upon\r\nconstitutional causes.\r\n\r\nSCABIES. (_Itch_.) This disease is characterized by a profuse scaliness\r\nof the skin, by an eruption of pimples, vesicles, and, in rare\r\ninstances, of pustules. Its prominent feature is an intense itching, so\r\naggravating that, in many instances, the skin is torn by the nails.\r\nUnlike other diseases of the skin, it is not due to inflammation, but is\r\ncaused by animalculæ, or little parasites, termed by naturalists the\r\n_acarus scabiei_. This minute animal burrows in the skin, irritating it,\r\nand thus producing the scaliness and itching. The vesicles are\r\ncomparatively few in number, and contain a transparent fluid. The\r\npustules are only present in the severest forms or when the skin is very\r\nthin and tender. It is then termed _pustular itch_.\r\n\r\nThe parts usually affected are the hands, flexures of the joints, and\r\nthe genital organs. Cases are recorded, in which scabies appeared upon\r\nthe face and head, but they are of rare occurrence. The activity of the\r\nanimalculæ, is modified by the vitality of the victim. In persons of a\r\nvigorous constitution, they will rapidly multiply, and, in a few days\r\nafter their first appearance, will be found in almost every part of the\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nScabies is not confined to any age or sex, but chiefly affects persons\r\nof filthy habits. This disease can only be communicated by contact, or\r\nby articles of clothing worn by an infected person. There are certain\r\nindications which predispose the system to infection, such as robust\r\nhealth, a hot climate, and uncleanliness.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. In all the varieties of eczematous affections, except\r\nscabies, the treatment of which will hereafter be separately considered,\r\nremedies employed with a view to the removal of the constitutional fault\r\nare of the greatest importance. The eruption upon the skin is but a\r\nlocal manifestation of a functional fault, which must be overcome by\r\nalterative remedies. All the excretory organs should be kept active. To\r\nopen the bowels, administer a full cathartic dose of Dr. Pierce's\r\nPleasant Pellets. Afterwards they should be used in broken doses of one\r\nor two daily, in order to obtain their peculiar _alterative_ effects.\r\nThe use of Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery is also necessary to\r\nsecure its constitutional remedial benefits. As a local corrective to\r\nrelieve the itching and disagreeable dryness of the skin, add half an\r\nounce of blood-root to half a pint of vinegar, steep moderately for two\r\nhours, strain and paint the affected parts once or twice daily with the\r\nliquid. Every night before retiring, apply glycerine freely to all the\r\naffected parts, or dissolve one drachm of oxalic acid in four ounces of\r\nglycerine and anoint the skin freely. The white precipitate ointment,\r\nobtainable at any drug store, is an excellent application is most forms\r\nof eczema. A tea, or infusion, of black walnut leaves, applied as a\r\nlotion to the affected parts, has also proved beneficial. The surface of\r\nthe body should be kept clean by frequent bathing, and thus stimulating\r\nits capillary vessels to healthy activity. The eczematous surfaces\r\nshould not be bathed frequently, and never with harsh or irritating\r\nsoaps. All varieties of eczematous affections, except scabies, are only\r\ntemporarily relieved by external applications, while the _radical cure_\r\ndepends upon a protracted use of alterative, or blood-cleansing\r\nmedicines. Therefore, we would again remind the reader of the necessity\r\nof keeping the bowels regular, and removing all morbid taints of the\r\nblood and faults of the secretory organs by the persistent use of Dr.\r\nPierce's Golden Medical Discovery. _The successful treatment of\r\nscabies_, or common itch, generally requires only local applications,\r\nfor the object to be obtained is simply the destruction of the little\r\ninsects which cause the eruption. Happily, we possess an _unfailing\r\nspecific_ for this purpose. Numerous agents have been employed with\r\nsuccess, but _Sulphur_ enjoys the greatest reputation for efficacy, and,\r\nsince it is perfectly harmless, we advise it for this class of disease.\r\nTake a quantity of pulverized sulphur and mix with sufficient vaseline\r\nor lard to form an ointment. Having first divested the body of clothing,\r\nanoint it all over freely, and rub the ointment thoroughly into the\r\npores of the skin while standing before a hot fire. The application\r\nshould be made at night before retiring, and the patient should wear\r\nwoolen night-clothes or lie between woolen blankets. In the morning\r\nafter the application, the patient should take a warm bath, washing the\r\nskin thoroughly and using _plenty of soap_. This treatment should be\r\nrepeated two or three times to be _certain_ of a _perfect eradication_\r\nof the disease. After this course of treatment, the wearing apparel as\r\nwell as the bed-clothes should be thoroughly cleansed, as a precaution\r\nagainst a return of the disease.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nERYTHEMATOUS AFFECTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe prominent features, eruption, and itching of _eczematous_ affections\r\nare purely local. _Erythematous_ affections are, however, remarkable for\r\ntheir symptoms of constitutional disorder. Each of these affections is\r\npreceded by intense febrile excitement and nervous debility. In brief,\r\nthe local manifestations are simply signs of general internal disorders;\r\nhence, the treatment should be directed to the restoration of the\r\nsystem. This group includes _erythema, erysipelas_, and _urticaria_.\r\n\r\nERYTHEMA. A vivid and partial flushing of the face is produced by a\r\nsuperficial inflammation of the skin, termed _erythema_. There are many\r\nstages of this disease, from the instantaneous transient flush caused by\r\nemotional excitement, to the protracted inflammation and swelling of\r\n_erythema nodosum_.\r\n\r\nThe affection is characterized by a flush which is at first a bright\r\nvivid scarlet, but which changes to a deep purplish tint. There is a\r\nslight elevation of the skin, sometimes accompanied by itching. In the\r\nsecond stage of development, the flush subsides, the skin has a\r\nyellowish or bruised appearance, and a few minute scales are formed. In\r\n_erythema papulosum_, a fine representation of which is given in Colored\r\nPlate III, Fig. 18, there is an eruption of red pimples or pustules. The\r\nprominent feature of _erythema nodosum_, a variety of erythema which\r\naffects those portions of the skin exposed to the sun, is the appearance\r\nof a large swelling, usually lasting four or five days and attended by\r\nconstitutional symptoms, such as nausea, fever, languor, and\r\ndespondency. The disease is associated with the symptoms incident to a\r\ndisordered nervous system and sometimes results fatally, in other cases,\r\nit terminates in melancholy and mania.\r\n\r\nCAUSES. The predisposing causes of erythema are constitutional debility,\r\nchanges of climate and temperature, and irritating food or medicines.\r\nLocally, it may be produced by friction and the heat of the sun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate III.\r\nFig. 14.\r\nFig. 15.\r\nFig. 16.\r\nFig. 20.\r\nFig. 17.\r\nFig. 19.\r\nFig. 18.]\r\n\r\nERYSIPELAS. There are few adult persons in this country who have not, by\r\nobservation or experience, become somewhat familiar with this disease.\r\nIts manifestations are both constitutional and local, and their\r\nintensity varies exceedingly in different cases. The constitutional\r\nsymptoms are usually the first to appear, and are of a febrile\r\ncharacter. A distinct chill, attended by nausea and general derangement\r\nof the stomach is experienced, followed by febrile symptoms more or less\r\nsevere. There are wandering pains in the body and sometimes a passive\r\ndelirium exists. Simultaneously with these symptoms the local\r\nmanifestations of the disease appear. A red spot develops on the face\r\nthe ear, or other part of the person. Its boundary is clearly marked and\r\nthe affected portion slightly raised above the surrounding surface. It\r\nis characterized by a burning pain and is very sensitive to the touch.\r\nIt is not necessary for the information of the general reader that we\r\nshould draw a distinction between the different varieties of this\r\nmalady. The distinctions made are founded chiefly upon the _depth_ to\r\nwhich the morbid condition extends, and not on any difference in the\r\n_nature of the affection_.\r\n\r\nSuppuration of the tissues involved is common in the severer forms.\r\nShould the tongue become dark and diarrhea set in, attended with great\r\nprostration, the case is very serious, and energetic means should be\r\nemployed to save life. A retrocession of the inflammation from the\r\nsurface to a vital organ is an extremely dangerous symptom.\r\n\r\nThe disease is not regarded as contagious, but has been known to become\r\nepidemic.\r\n\r\nURTICARIA. (_Hives, or Nettle-Rash._) This word is derived from\r\n_urtica_, signifying a nettle; it is a transient affection of the skin,\r\nindicated by a fierce, burning, itching sensation and a development of\r\npustules, or white blotches of various forms. A representation of this\r\neruption is given in Colored Plate III, Fig. 17. It is appropriately\r\nnamed nettle-rash, from its resemblance to the irritation caused by the\r\nsting of a nettle. There is the same sharp, tingling sensation and a\r\nsimilar white wheal or blotch, caused by the muscular spasm of the\r\ncorium, a layer of the skin.\r\n\r\nUrticaria may be either acute or chronic. Acute urticaria is always\r\npreceded by febrile symptoms and the attack is indicated by a sudden\r\ncongestion of the skin, followed by a slight swelling or elevation of\r\nthe affected part. When the congestion subsides, the skin has a bruised\r\nappearance. In chronic urticaria, the febrile symptoms are absent.\r\n\r\nCAUSES. The exciting causes of urticaria are gastric disorder,\r\nirritation of the mucous membrane, or a sudden nervous shock. The\r\npredisposing causes are conceded to be assimilative and nervous\r\ndebility. Hence, it frequently accompanies purpura or land scurvy and\r\nrheumatism. The skin in some persons is so susceptible to irritation\r\nthat urticaria can be kindled at any moment by excitement, as an\r\nanimated conversation, or by the simple pressure of the hand.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. The proper treatment for simple erythema consists in applying\r\nto the affected parts a little lime-water, or sweet-oil, or glycerine,\r\nwith the use of warm baths and mild cathartics. This is generally\r\nsufficient to effect a cure, if followed up with the persistent use of\r\nDr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery taken three times a day.\r\n\r\nIn _erysipelas_ a hot bath, with warm, sweating teas, or, better still.\r\nDr. Pierce's Compound Extract of Smart-weed may be given to favor\r\nsweating. The whole person should be frequently bathed with warm water\r\nrendered alkaline by the addition of saleratus or soda. The whole should\r\nbe moved by a full dose of the \"Pleasant Pellets.\" Fluid extract of\r\nveratrum viride, in doses of a drop or two every hour will best control\r\nthe fever. The specific treatment, that which antidotes the poison in\r\nthe blood, consists in administering fifteen-drop doses of the tincture\r\nof the muriate of iron in one teaspoonful of the \"Golden Medical\r\nDiscovery,\" every three hours. As a local application, the inflamed\r\nsurface may be covered with cloths wet in the mucilage of slippery elm.\r\nA preparation of equal parts of sweet oil and spirits of turpentine,\r\nmixed and painted over the surface, is an application of great efficacy.\r\n\r\n_For urticaria_, the \"Pleasant Pellets\" should be administered in\r\nsufficient doses to move the bowels, the skin bathed with warm water\r\nrendered alkaline by the addition of common baking soda or saleratus,\r\nand, if there be any febrile symptoms, a little tincture of aconite or\r\nveratrum may be administered in one drop doses once each hour. In the\r\nchronic form of the disease, the diet should be light, unstimulating,\r\nand easily digested, the skin kept clean by frequent bathing, and fresh\r\nair and outdoor exercises freely taken. The somewhat protracted use of\r\nDr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery will result in the greatest\r\nbenefit in this form of disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nBULLOUS AFFECTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe distinguishing feature of this group of cutaneous affections is the\r\nformation of _bullæ_, or blebs, which are defined as \"eminences of the\r\ncuticle, containing a fluid.\"\r\n\r\nHERPES is an inflammation of the skin in which the eruption appears in\r\npatches of a circular form. On the second day, minute, transparent\r\nvesicles appear and gradually develop, becoming opalescent. On the\r\nsucceeding days, they shrink and produce reddish brown scabs, which soon\r\nbecome hard and fall off, leaving deep, purplish pits. In adults, these\r\nvesicles sometimes terminate in painful ulcers, caused by an irritation\r\nof the eruption. By some practitioners, herpes is regarded as a purely\r\nnervous disorder, from the fact that it is frequently accompanied by\r\nsevere neuralgic pains. These pains are not _constant_, but\r\n_occasional_, and do not appear at any definite stage of the disease.\r\nSometimes they precede and accompany the eruption. Other instances are\r\nrecorded in which they remained many years after the disease had\r\ndisappeared. The local and constant pain of herpes is a severe burning,\r\nprickling, itching sensation, which remains after the scabs fall.\r\n\r\nThe three _general_ forms of this disease are _herpes zoster_,\r\n_phlyctoenodes_ and _circinatus_.\r\n\r\nIn _herpes zoster_, or _shingles_, the clusters of vesicles encircle\r\none-half of the body, frequently at the waist; hence, it has received\r\nthe name of _zona_ or _girdle_. The vesicles often develop into bullæ,\r\nand sometimes ulcerate. In _herpes phlyctoenodes_, the vesicles are\r\nsmall, round, and irregularly distributed over the face, neck, arms, and\r\nbreast. This form is accompanied by febrile symptoms and offensive\r\nexcretions.\r\n\r\nIn _herpes circinatus_, or _ringworm_, the vesicles appear in circular\r\npatches, or rings. This is the mildest form of herpes, and is not\r\nattended by symptoms of constitutional disorder. The various forms of\r\nherpes are represented in Colored Plate I, Fig. 3.\r\n\r\nCAUSES. Herpes is not contagious. It is caused by vicissitudes of heat\r\nand cold, violent emotions, excessive exertion, irritation of the skin,\r\nand a general atony of the system.\r\n\r\nMILIARIA is the name given to an eruption of vesicles which are larger\r\nthan those of eczema, but smaller than the bullæ of herpes. At first,\r\nthe serum contained in the vesicles is perfectly transparent, and\r\nreflects the red tint of the underlying skin, hence the name _miliaria\r\nrubra._ But gradually it becomes milky and opalescent, hence, the term\r\n_miliaria alba_. The vesicles of miliaria are generally solitary, and\r\nappear on those portions of the body most liable to become heated and to\r\nperspire. The eruption is preceded by chills, languor, slight fever,\r\nintense thirst, a sharp prickling sensation of the skin, and profuse\r\nperspiration. The vesicles soon desiccate and are replaced by a new\r\ncrop.\r\n\r\nCAUSES. Miliaria is almost universally an accompaniment of febrile\r\ndisease, and all disorders in which there occurs a profuse perspiration.\r\nThe causes to which it may be traced in each instance are improper diet,\r\nimpure air, burdensome clothing, or strong emotions.\r\n\r\nPEMPHIGUS is a peculiar eruption which appears upon the limbs and\r\nabdomen. The affected part is of a bright red color, and, in a few\r\nhours, small vesicles appear containing a transparent fluid. The\r\nvesicles soon develop into bullæ, entirely covering the inflamed\r\nportion. The fluid becomes opaque and in a few hours escapes. The patch\r\nis then covered with a yellow scab. Pemphigus may be either acute or\r\nchronic. The acute form is subdivided according to the degree of\r\ninflammation, as _pemphigus pompholyx_ in which it is severe, and\r\n_pemphigus benignus,_ when it is mild. The bullæ of pemphigus are\r\nillustrated in Colored Plate III, Fig. 19.\r\n\r\nCAUSE. Pemphigus is always caused by a vitiated state of the system.\r\n\r\nRUPIA is indicated by an eruption as large as a chestnut containing a\r\nwatery fluid, which desiccates into a yellowish-brown crust. A fine\r\nrepresentation of rupia vesicles in both stages of development, is given\r\nin Colored Plate II, Fig. 13.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. In all forms of herpes, the administration of a small dose of\r\nDr. Pierce's Pleasant Pellets, with the use of his \"Golden Medical\r\nDiscovery\" in one to two teaspoonful doses three times a day, will be\r\nfollowed by the happiest results. The skin should be kept clean by the\r\nuse of the sponge-bath, rendered alkaline by the addition of common\r\nbaking soda or saleratus. The portion of the body covered by the\r\neruption, should be bathed with a solution of sulphate of zinc, one\r\nounce to a pint of water.\r\n\r\nMiliaria is generally associated with certain febrile diseases, and its\r\nproper treatment consists in overcoming the febrile and other\r\nconstitutional symptoms which accompany the disease. A hot foot-bath and\r\nsmall doses of tincture of aconite, say one drop in water each hour,\r\nwill suffice to remove the fever. If the stomach and bowels are in a\r\nvitiated condition, as they are apt to be, a mild cathartic dose of\r\n\"Pellets\" should be given.\r\n\r\n_The treatment of pemphigus_ should consist in frequent alkaline\r\nsponge-baths, and in covering the affected parts with poultices of\r\nslippery elm, which should be kept moist with vinegar, The\r\nconstitutional treatment should embrace the persistent use of the\r\n\"Golden Medical Discovery.\" When the disease occurs in children, it is\r\nmost generally dependent upon deficient nutrition, and special attention\r\nshould be given to the diet of the patient, which should be nutritious.\r\nFresh air and outdoor exercise ought not to be neglected.\r\n\r\nThe proper treatment of rupia does not differ from that suggested for\r\npemphigus.\r\n\r\n\r\nNERVOUS AFFECTIONS OF THE SKIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn nervous affections of the skin, the natural sensibility may be\r\nincreased, diminished, or perverted. These morbid impressions arise from\r\nthe nervous system. Although there are several varieties of these\r\naffections, yet, being of minor importance, we shall omit their\r\nconsideration and only speak of one of them in this work.\r\n\r\nPRURIGO affects the entire surface of the body and imparts to the skin a\r\nparched, yellowish appearance. It is characterized by pimples, and an\r\nintense burning, itching sensation. Rubbing and scratching only irritate\r\nthe skin, which becomes covered with thin black scabs. A good\r\nrepresentation of _prurigo_ may be seen in Colored Plate II, Fig. 6. The\r\nitching sensations are sometimes caused by chilling the body, by violent\r\nexercise, and heat; allowing the mind to dwell upon the affection\r\naggravates it. Prurigo is recognized under two forms; _vulgaris,_ which\r\nis a mild form, and _senilis_, which chiefly occurs in old age, and is\r\nmore severe. The external genital parts of females are frequently\r\naffected with this disease, and it is aggravated by menstruation and\r\nuncleanliness.\r\n\r\nThis affection may be due to a vitiated condition of the blood, and is\r\ncommon among those who are greatly debilitated. It is frequently\r\noccasioned by uncleanliness, intemperance, the use of unwholesome food,\r\nor by an impure atmosphere.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. To allay the itching, take glycerine, one ounce, add to it\r\none drachm of _sulphite_ of soda, and one ounce of rose-water, and apply\r\nthis to the affected parts. A solution made with borax, two drachms, and\r\nmorphine, fire grains, dissolved in six ounces of rose-water, makes an\r\nexcellent lotion to allay the itching. If the disease be severe, it will\r\nbe necessary to correct the vitiated condition of the blood by a\r\nprotracted use of Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery, and to aid its\r\neffects, give one \"Pleasant Pellet\" every day, not to operate as a\r\ncathartic, but only to exert an alterative influence.\r\n\r\n\r\nALPHOUS AFFECTIONS.\r\n\r\n(SCALY SKIN DISEASES.)\r\n\r\n\r\nDifferences of opinion exist with regard to the proper classification of\r\nthese affections. We shall briefly consider _alphos_, which is sometimes\r\nconfounded with _lepra_.\r\n\r\nALPHOS, which from its Greek derivation signifies _white_, is\r\ncharacterized by circular, slightly raised white spots. These eruptions\r\nvary in size from one line to two inches in diameter, and may be\r\nscattered over the entire surface of the body, although they most\r\nfrequently appear upon the elbows and knees. Alphos may consist of a\r\nsingle tubercle, or of large clusters constituting patches. The scales\r\nvary in color and thickness. In Colored Plate III, Figs. 14 and 15, are\r\nfine illustrations of alphos. When a person begins to recover from this\r\naffection, the scales fall off, leaving a smooth red surface, which\r\ngradually returns to its natural color.\r\n\r\nThis disease is more liable to occur in winter than in summer, although\r\nin some cases the reverse holds true. It may disappear for a time, only\r\nto return again with renewed vigor. It is not regarded as contagious.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. Thorough and protracted constitutional treatment is required\r\nto overcome this disease. Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery should\r\nbe taken internally and also applied locally to the affected parts. To\r\nevery other bottle of the \"Discovery\" which is taken, one-half ounce of\r\nthe iodide of potash may be added. One or two of the \"Pellets\" taken\r\ndaily will prove a useful adjunct to the \"Discovery.\"\r\n\r\nLocally, we have sometimes applied a lotion made of oxide of zinc,\r\none-half drachm; benzoic acid, two drachms; morphine, five grains;\r\nglycerine, two ounces. Tincture of the chloride of iron, one drachm in\r\none ounce of glycerine, makes an excellent local application. Whatever\r\nthe local treatment may be, however, we chiefly rely upon the\r\n_persistent_ use of the best alteratives, or blood-cleansing medicines.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFECTIONS OF THE HAIR-FOLLICLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAVUS (_Scald Head_) is a disease peculiar to the hair-follicles, and is\r\nindicated by the formation of small yellow crusts, having the form of an\r\ninverted cup. The eruption has a very offensive odor. When it appears in\r\nisolated cups, it is termed _favus dispersus_, but it often occurs in\r\nlarge clusters, as represented in Colored Plate II, Fig. 12, and is then\r\ntermed _favus confertus_. It generally affects the scalp, but sometimes\r\nextends to the face and neck.\r\n\r\nCAUSE. Favus is caused by nutritive debility, which results in a\r\nperverted cell-growth.\r\n\r\nSYCOSIS (_Barber's Itch_) is an inflammatory affection of the hair\r\nfollicles of the face. The prominent features of the disease are redness\r\nand the formation of scales. It is peculiar to males. It has received\r\nvarious names, according to its predominating characteristics, such as\r\n_sycosis papulosa, tuberculosa_, and _fungulosa_. Colored Plate II, Fig.\r\n10, is a line illustration of sycosis as it appears on the cheek.\r\n\r\nCAUSES. Various causes induce the appearance of sycosis. The general\r\ncauses are nutritive debility, vicissitudes of heat and cold, and an\r\nexhausted state of the nervous system. It may also result from various\r\nchronic diseases, such as syphilis and dyspepsia.\r\n\r\nCOMEDONES, or _grubs_, are due to a retention of the sebaceous matter in\r\nthe follicles. The sebaceous substance undergoes a change, becoming\r\ngranular and somewhat hardened. It gradually extends to the mouth of the\r\nfollicle, where it comes in contact with the atmosphere, and assumes a\r\ndark color, as represented in Plate II, Fig. 8. This fact, together with\r\nits peculiar form when squeezed out of the skin, has caused it to be\r\ntermed _grub_. They often appear in great numbers on the face of persons\r\nwhose circulation is not active, or those who are of a particularly\r\nnervous temperament. Stimulating baths and friction will prove very\r\nefficacious in removing these cylinders of sebaceous matter. If they are\r\nallowed to remain, they will produce an irritation of the skin causing\r\nan inflammatory disease known as acne, or stone-pock.\r\n\r\nACNE OR STONE-POCK. In the earliest stage of congestion, acne is\r\ncharacterized by minute hardened elevations of the skin, as shown in\r\nPlate II, Fig. 9, and is termed _acne punctata_. As the affection\r\nprogresses, a bright red pimple, Plate II, Fig. 11, appears, having a\r\nconical form, hence the name _acne coniformis_. The pimple develops into\r\na pustule containing yellow \"matter,\" and is then known as _acne\r\npustulosa_. This is followed by a thickening of the tissues, termed\r\n_acne tuberculata_. When the thicker skin is removed, it leaves a deep\r\nscar, hence the term _acne indurata_.\r\n\r\nCAUSES. The remote cause of acne is nutritive debility. The immediate\r\ncauses are rapid growth, anæmia, improper food, errors of hygiene,\r\nmental exhaustion, and various chronic diseases.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. The treatment of favus or scald-head should be commenced by\r\nshaving the hair off close to the scalp and washing the head thoroughly\r\nwith soap and water. In some severe cases, it may be necessary to soften\r\nthe incrustations with poultices, following these with a free use of\r\nsoap and water. Having thus exposed the scalp and thoroughly divested it\r\nof incrustations, apply to it the ointment of iodide of sulphur, which\r\nmay be procured at any good drug store. It should be gently rubbed over\r\nthe parts night and morning. The scalp ought to be kept perfectly clean\r\nthroughout the treatment. Instead of the foregoing, the following may be\r\napplied: Take oxalic acid, ten grains; creosote, twenty drops; water,\r\ntwo ounces; mix. Half an hour after using this lotion, anoint the head\r\nfreely with butter or lard; it will add greatly to the efficacy of the\r\ntreatment. But while local applications will relieve many skin diseases\r\nand mitigate suffering, we cannot too strongly impress upon the minds of\r\nour readers the importance, in this as in all other chronic diseases of\r\nthe skin, of perseverance in the use of the best alteratives. In this\r\nclass of agents Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery stands\r\npre-eminent. Its efficacy may be increased in this disease by adding to\r\neach bottle one ounce of the acetate of potash, and, when thus modified,\r\nit may be administered in the same manner as if no addition had been\r\nmade to it.\r\n\r\n_The Treatment of Sycosis_ should be essentially the same as that\r\nsuggested for favus, and it will result in prompt relief and a permanent\r\ncure.\r\n\r\n_Treatment of Acne._ In the treatment of this, as in that of other\r\ndiseases, we should seek to ascertain the cause, and, when possible,\r\nremove it. Outdoor exercise, a spare, unstimulating diet, and perfect\r\ncleanliness are of the first importance. The affected parts should be\r\nbathed with warm water and Castile, or, what is better, carbolic soap.\r\nWashing the face in cold water generally aggravates the disease. As a\r\nlocal application to the pustules, we have used with good results the\r\nfollowing lotion: Oxide of zinc, twenty grains; morphine, five grains;\r\nglycerine, two ounces: mix. First having washed the affected parts\r\nthoroughly, apply this compound. Our chief reliance, however, as in the\r\npreceding diseases, should be upon the persistent use of alteratives and\r\nmild cathartics or laxatives.\r\n\r\n\r\nFURUNCULAR AFFECTIONS. (BOIL-LIKE AFFECTIONS.)\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder this head properly belong boils, carbuncles, and styes.\r\n\r\nBOILS. These annoying affections are hard, prominent, circumscribed,\r\ninflamed, suppurating tumors, having their seat in the cellular tissue\r\nbeneath the skin. They vary in size from a pea to a hen's egg, and may\r\noccur on any part of the body. The color of a boil varies from deep red\r\nto mahogany. It is painful, tender, advances rapidly to maturity,\r\nbecomes conical, and finally bursts and discharges bloody \"matter.\"\r\nThrough the opening, and filling the cavity, may be seen a piece of\r\nsloughing cellular tissue which is called the _core_. In from four to\r\nfifteen days, it is all expelled and the sore rapidly heals. The causes\r\nare an impure condition of the blood, which generally arises from\r\nimperfect action of the liver or kidneys.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. Spirits of turpentine applied to a boll _in its earliest\r\nstage_ will almost always cause it to disappear; but when suppuration\r\nhas commenced it should be favored by the application of poultices. Next\r\npurify the blood to prevent subsequent returns to other parts of the\r\nbody. For this purpose take Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery. One\r\nor two \"Pleasant Pellets\" each day will aid in the cure.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARBUNCLE. (ANTHRAX.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are more violent, larger, and more painful than boils, which they\r\nresemble. They may spring from several small pimples which extend deep\r\ninto the tissues, and on the surface frequently several small vesicles\r\nappear and break. They may discharge, through one or several openings, a\r\nthin acrid, bloody, or dark-colored fluid. They most frequently appear\r\nupon the back of the neck, back, back part of the limbs, and under the\r\narms. Their presence is evidence of a depressed condition of vitality.\r\nThese tumors vary in size from one-half an inch to six inches in\r\ndiameter, and rapidly proceed to a gangrenous condition, a grayish\r\nslough being detached from the healthy tissue.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. Invigorate the system by every possible means. The bitter\r\ntonics, such as Golden Seal, Gentian, or Willow, together with quinine\r\nand iron should be used. Nutritious diet, pure air, etc., are necessary.\r\nPurify the blood to remove the causes of the disease. For this purpose,\r\ngive the \"Golden Medical Discovery\" in as large doses as can be borne\r\nwithout acting too freely on the bowels. Anodynes may be necessary to\r\novercome the pain. Poultices are useful to encourage the separation of\r\nthe dead from the living tissues. Antiseptic dressings are beneficial,\r\nof which carbolic acid is to be preferred; yeast, however, may be\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nSometimes powerful caustics or free incisions are productive of\r\ngratifying results, if followed by appropriate dressings, but these\r\nextreme measures should only be resorted to by the direction of a\r\nphysician.\r\n\r\nFor a considerable time after the urgent symptoms have subsided, the\r\n\"Golden Medical Discovery\" should be used, to purify and enrich the\r\nblood, and the bitter tonics and iron may be alternated with it, or be\r\nused conjointly to good advantage.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCROFULA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that about one fifth of the human family are afflicted\r\nwith scrofula. A disease so prevalent and so destructive to life, should\r\nenlist universal attention and the best efforts of medical men in\r\ndevising the most successful treatment for its cure. It varies in the\r\nintensity of its manifestation, from the slightest eruption upon the\r\nskin (scrofulous eczema), to that most fatal of maladies, pulmonary\r\nconsumption.\r\n\r\nTHE SCROFULOUS DIATHESIS. The existence of a certain disposition or\r\nhabit of body designated as the _scrofulous_ or _strumous diathesis_, is\r\ngenerally recognized by medical practitioners and writers as a\r\nconstitutional condition predisposing many children to the development\r\nof this disease. Enlargement of the head and abdomen, fair, soft and\r\ntransparent or dark, sallow, greasy or wax-looking skin, and precocious\r\nintellect are supposed to indicate this diathesis.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic feature of this disease, in all the multifarious\r\nforms that it assumes, is the formation of tubercle, which, when the\r\nmalady is fully developed, is an ever-present and distinguishing\r\nelement.\r\n\r\n_Tuberculous_ is therefore almost synonymous with _scrofulous_, and to\r\nfacilitate an acquaintance with a large list of very prevalent maladies,\r\nwe may generalize, and classify them all under this generic term. As\r\n_tubercle_ is frequently spoken of in works treating on medicine and\r\nsurgery, playing, as it does, a conspicuous part in an important list of\r\ndiseases, the reader may very naturally be led to inquire:\r\n\r\nWHAT IS TUBERCLE? As employed in pathology, the term is usually applied\r\nto a species of degeneration, or morbid development of a pale yellow\r\ncolor, having, in its crude condition, a consistence analogous to that\r\nof pretty firm cheese. The physical properties of tubercle are not\r\nuniform, however. They vary with age and other circumstances. Some are\r\nhard and calcareous, while others are soft and pus-like. The color\r\nvaries from a light yellow, or almost white, to a dark gray.\r\n\r\nIt is almost wholly composed of albumen united with a small amount of\r\nearthy salts, as phosphate and carbonate of lime, with a trace of the\r\nsoluble salts of soda.\r\n\r\nThe existence of tubercular deposits in the tissues of the body, which\r\ncharacterizes scrofula, when fully developed, must not, however, be\r\nregarded as the primary affection. Its formation is the result of\r\ndisordered nutrition. The products of digestion are not fully\r\nelaborated, and pass into the blood imperfected, in which condition they\r\nare unable to fulfill their normal destiny--the repair of the bodily\r\ntissues. Imperfectly formed albuminous matter oozes out from the blood,\r\nand infiltrates the tissues, but it has little tendency to take on\r\ncell-forms or undergo the vital transformation essential to becoming a\r\npart of the tissues. Instead of nutritive energy, which by assimilation\r\nproduces perfect bodily textures, this function, in the scrofulous\r\ndiathesis, is deranged by debility, and there is left in the tissues an\r\nimperfectly organized particle, incapable of undergoing a complete vital\r\nchange, around which cluster other particles of tubercular matter,\r\nforming little grains, like millet seed, or growing, by new accretions\r\nof like particles, to masses of more extensive size. As tubercle is but\r\na semi-organized substance, of deficient vitality, it is very prone to\r\ndisintegration and suppuration. Being foreign to the tissues in which it\r\nis embedded, like a thorn in the flesh, it excites a passive form of\r\ninflammation, and from lack of inherent vital energy it is apt to\r\ndecompose and cause the formation of pus. Hence, infiltration of the\r\nmuscles, glands, or other soft parts with tuberculous matter, when\r\ninflammation is aroused by its presence, and by an exciting cause, give\r\nrise to abscesses, as in lumbar or psoas abscesses. When occurring in\r\nthe joints, tubercles may give rise to chronic suppurative inflammation,\r\nas in white swellings and hip-joint disease. Various skin diseases are\r\nregarded as local expressions of, or as being materially modified by,\r\nthe scrofulous diathesis, as eczema, impetigo, and lupus. The disease\r\npopularly known as \"_fever-sore_\" is another form of scrofulous\r\nmanifestation, affecting the shafts of the bones, and causing\r\ndisorganization and decay of their structure. Discharges from the ear,\r\nbronchitis, chronic inflammation of the intestinal mucous membrane, and\r\nchronic diarrhea are frequently due to scrofula, while pulmonary\r\nconsumption is unanimously regarded as a purely scrofulous affectation.\r\nScrofula shows a strong disposition to manifest itself in the lymphatic\r\nglands, particularly in the superficial ones of the neck. The most\r\ndistinguishing feature of this form of the disease is the appearance of\r\nlittle kernels or tumors about the neck. These often remain about the\r\nsame size, neither increasing nor diminishing, until finally, without\r\nhaving caused much inconvenience, they disappear. After a time these\r\nglands may again enlarge, with more or less pain accompanying the\r\nprocess. As the disease progresses, the pain increases, and the parts\r\nbecome hot and swollen. At length the \"matter\" which has been forming\r\nbeneath, finds its way to the surface and is discharged in the form of\r\nthin pus, frequently containing little particles or flakes of tubercular\r\nmatter. During the inflammatory process there may be more or less\r\nfebrile movement, paleness of the surface, languor, impaired appetite,\r\nnight sweats, and general feebleness of the system. The resulting open\r\nulcers show little disposition to heal.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS. There is a train of symptoms characteristic of all scrofulous\r\ndisease. The appetite may be altogether lost or feeble, or in extreme\r\ncases, voracious. In some instances there is an unusual disposition to\r\neat fatty substances. The general derangement of the alimentary\r\nfunctions is indicated by a red, glazed or furrowed appearance of the\r\ntongue, flatulent condition of the stomach, and bloated state of the\r\nbowels, followed by diarrhea or manifesting obstinate constipation.\r\nThirst and frequent acid eructations accompany the imperfect digestion.\r\nThe foul breath, early decay of the teeth, the slimy, glairy stools,\r\nhaving the appearance of the white of eggs, and an intolerable fetor,\r\nall are indicative of the scrofulous tendencies of the system.\r\n\r\nCAUSES. Scrofula may be attributed to various causes. Observation has\r\nshown that ill-assorted marriages are a prolific source of scrofula.\r\nBoth parents may be not only healthy and free from hereditary taints,\r\nbut robust, well-formed physically, perfectly developed, and yet not one\r\nof their children be free from this dire disease. It may present itself\r\nin the form of hip disease, white swelling, \"fever-sore\" suppurating\r\nglands, curvature of the spine, rickets, ulcers, pulmonary consumption,\r\nor some skin disease, in every case showing the original perversion of\r\nthe constitution and functions. Scrofula is hereditary when the disease,\r\nor the diathesis which predisposes to its development, is transmitted\r\nfrom one or both parents who are affected by it, or who are deficient in\r\nconstitutional energy, showing feeble nutrition, lack of circulatory\r\nforce, and a diminished vitality. All these conditions indicate that a\r\nfew exposures and severe colds are often sufficient to produce a train\r\nof symptoms, which terminate in pulmonary or other strumous affections.\r\nWhatever deranges the function of nutrition is favorable to the\r\ndevelopment of scrofula, therefore, irregularities and various excesses\r\ntend to inaugurate it. Depletion of the blood by drastic and poisonous\r\nmedicines, such as antimony and mercurials, hemorrhages and\r\nblood-letting, syphilis, excessive mental or physical labor, as well as\r\na too early use and abuse of the sexual organs, all tend to waste the\r\nblood, reduce the tone of the system, and develop scrofula.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.\r\nA Scrofulous Tumor]\r\n\r\nScrofula may be the consequence of insufficient nourishment, resulting\r\nfrom subsisting upon poor food, or a too exclusively vegetable diet,\r\nwith little or no animal food.\r\n\r\nWant of exercise and uncleanliness contribute to its production. It is\r\nmuch more prevalent in temperate latitudes, where the climate is\r\nvariable, than in tropical or frigid regions. The season of the year\r\nalso greatly influences this disease, for it frequently commences in the\r\nwinter and spring, and disappears again in the summer and autumn months.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. The skin should be kept clean by means of frequent baths.\r\nThese assist the functional changes which must take place on the surface\r\nof the body, permit the stimulating influence of the light and air and\r\nfacilitate the aeration of the blood, as well as the transpiration of\r\nfluids through the innumerable pores of the skin. All exposure to a low\r\ntemperature, especially in damp weather, and the wearing of an\r\ninsufficient amount of clothing should be avoided. Then the food should\r\nbe generous and of the most nourishing character. Steady habits and\r\nregular hours for eating and sleep must be observed, if we would restore\r\ntone and regularity to the functions of nutrition. Moderate exercise in\r\nthe open air is essential, in order that the blood may become well\r\noxygenated, that the vital changes may take place. It is no doubt true\r\nthat the occasion of the prevalence of scrofula among the lower classes\r\nmay be ascribed to frequent and severe climatic exposures, irregular and\r\npoor diet, or want of due cleanliness. Every well-regulated family can\r\navoid such causes and live with a due regard to the conditions of\r\nhealth. The proper treatment of scrofula is important, because we meet\r\nwith its symptoms on every side, showing its slow actions upon different\r\nparts of the body and its influence upon all the organs. After this\r\ndisease has been existing for an indefinite length of time, certain\r\nglands enlarge, slowly inflame, finally suppurate, and are very\r\ndifficult to heal. These sores are very liable to degenerate into\r\nulcers. All of these symptoms point to a peculiar taste of the blood,\r\nwhich continually feeds and strengthens this morbid outbreak. All\r\nauthors agree that the blood is not rich in fibrinous elements, but\r\ntends to feebleness and slow inflammation, which ends in maturation.\r\nThus we may trace back this low and morbid condition of the blood to\r\ndebility of the nutritive organs, defective digestion, which may be\r\ninduced by irregular habits, a lack of nourishing food, or by the\r\nacquirement of some venereal taint.\r\n\r\nThe matter that is discharged from these glands is not healthy, but is\r\nthin, serous, and acrid; a whey-like fluid containing little fragments\r\nof tuberculous matter, which resembles curd. The affected glands\r\nulcerate, look blue and indolent, and manifest no disposition to heal.\r\nWe have thus traced this disorder back to weak, perverted and faulty\r\nnutrition, to disordered and vitiated blood, the products of which\r\nslowly inflame the glands, which strain out unhealthy, irritating,\r\npoisonous matter. The medicines to remedy this perverted condition of\r\nthe blood and fluids must be alteratives which will act upon the\r\ndigestive organs and tone the nutritive functions, thus enriching and\r\npurifying the blood. As this affection is frequently a complication in\r\nchronic diseases, it is eminently proper for us to refer to a few\r\nconsiderations involved in its general treatment.\r\n\r\nAn alterative medicine belongs to a class which is considered capable of\r\nproducing a salutary change in a disease without exciting any sensible\r\nevacuation. In scrofula, remedies should be employed which will improve\r\ndigestion and also prevent certain morbid operations in the blood.\r\n\r\nIt is well known to medical men that nearly all medicines belonging to\r\nthe class of alteratives, are capable of solution in the gastric and\r\nintestinal secretions, and pass without material change, by the process\r\nof absorption, through the coats of the stomach and intestines, as do\r\nall liquids, and so gain an entrance into the general circulation; that\r\nthese same alteratives act locally to tone and strengthen the mucous\r\nsurfaces, and thus promote and rectify the process of digestion before\r\nbeing absorbed; that alterative medicines, when in the blood, must\r\npermeate the mass of the circulation, and thus reach the remote parts of\r\nthe body and influence every function; that these medicines, while in\r\nthe blood, may combine with it, reconstruct it, and arrest its morbid\r\ntendencies to decomposition.\r\n\r\nWe should use those alteratives which give tone to the digestive and\r\nnutritive functions, in order to curtail the constant propagation of\r\nscrofula in the system; which alter and purify the blood through the\r\nnatural functions, thus reconstructing it; and which check the septic,\r\n_disorganizing_ changes which are evinced by the irritating and\r\npoisonous matter discharged from the ulcers.\r\n\r\nThese are the three ways in which medicines operate upon the nutritive\r\nfunctions and the blood.\r\n\r\nThus alteratives may be specifics, in so far as they are particularly\r\nuseful in certain disorders, and the combination which has been made in\r\nDr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery, excels all others with which we\r\nare acquainted, for scrofulous diseases, particularly in fulfilling the\r\nforegoing indications. It works out peculiar processes in the blood, not\r\nlike food, by supplying merely a natural want, but by strengthening the\r\nnutritive functions and counteracting morbid action, after which\r\noperations it passes out of the system by excretion.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said upon the importance of blood medicines and their\r\nmodes of action, the reader must not infer that we account for all\r\ndiseases by some fault of the humors of the body, for we do not. But\r\nthat scrofula, in its varied forms, results from imperfect nutrition and\r\ndisorders of the blood, is now universally conceded. It is for this\r\nreason that neither time nor pains have been spared in perfecting an\r\nalterative, tonic, nutritive, restorative, and antiseptic compound, to\r\nwhich Dr. Pierce has given the name of \"Golden Medical Discovery.\" Not\r\nonly is it an alterative and a nutritive restorative, acting upon the\r\nsecretions, but it opposes putrefaction and degenerative decay of the\r\nfluids and solids. Hence its universal indication in all scrofulous\r\ndiseases. It will intercept those thin, watery discharges which are the\r\nresult of weakness, degeneration, and putrescent decay of the blood,\r\nperpetuated by a low grade of scrofulous inflammation. By an adult it\r\ncan be taken in doses of from one to two teaspoonfuls three or four\r\ntimes per day.\r\n\r\nThe bowels should be properly regulated. When constipation exists one or\r\ntwo of Dr. Pierce's Pleasant Pellets taken daily, will fulfill the\r\nindication. The patient ought not to neglect to carry out all the\r\nhygienic recommendations heretofore given. The treatment of running\r\nsores is very simple. Cleanse them every day with Castile-soap and\r\nwater, being careful not to rub or touch the surface of the sores. Use a\r\nclean sponge or a piece of clean muslin and saturating it with the warm\r\nwater, hold it a few inches above the affected part, and squeeze out the\r\nfluid, allowing the cleansing stream to fall gently upon the open sore.\r\nAfter thoroughly cleansing the sore, apply to it Dr. Pierce's\r\nAll-Healing Salve. 25 cents in postage stamps sent to us will secure a\r\nbox by return post if your druggist does not have it in stock.\r\n\r\n\r\nHIP-JOINT DISEASE.\r\n\r\n(COXALGIA.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hip-joint disease_, also known as Coxalgia, is frequently a scrofulous\r\naffection of the hip-joint. It usually attacks children, but may occur\r\nat any period of life. The causes of this affection are imperfectly\r\nunderstood, yet all the indications point to a scrofulous state of the\r\nsystem. Dampness, cold, improper diet, severe injuries from blows or\r\nfalls are all numbered among the exciting causes which are conducive to\r\nthe establishment of this disease.\r\n\r\nTHE SYMPTOMS are usually developed gradually; at first there is severe\r\npain in the knee, but finally it is located in the hip-joint.\r\nOccasionally it is noticed in the hip and knee at the same time. As the\r\ndisease progresses, the general health becomes impaired, there is\r\nwasting of the muscles, wakefulness, disturbed sleep, high fever,\r\nprofuse and offensive perspiration, the hair falls out, and there is an\r\ninability to move the limb without producing excruciating pain.\r\nFrequently pus will be formed and discharged at different points, and\r\nthe limb will become greatly emaciated. Since pain in the knee-joint may\r\nmislead as to the location of the disease, to determine the seat of the\r\naffection, place the patient in a chair and percuss the knee lightly, by\r\ngiving it a slight blow with the knuckle; if the hip be affected, the\r\npain will be readily felt in that joint; if it be simply neuralgia of\r\nthe knee-joint, it will excite no pain whatever. If the disease be\r\nallowed to progress and dislocation of the joint takes place, the\r\naffected limb becomes shortened.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. The treatment of this disease should consist in rest for the\r\nhip-joint, cleanliness of the person and plenty of fresh air and light,\r\na nutritious diet and the use of tonics and sustaining alterative, or\r\nblood-cleansing medicines. Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery has,\r\nunaided by other medicines, cured many cases of this disease. This class\r\nof medicines should be persistently employed, in order to obtain their\r\nfull effects. It is a disease which progresses slowly and which is not\r\neasily turned from its course, and its fatality should warn the\r\nafflicted to employ the best treatment.\r\n\r\nMany poor, unfortunate victims know too well, from sad experience, that\r\nthe course of treatment frequently recommended and employed by\r\nphysicians and surgeons is ineffectual, and cruel; they deplete the\r\nsystem, apply locally liniments, lotions, iodine, and hot applications;\r\nconfine the patient in bed and strap his hips down immovably, thus\r\npreventing all exercise; then they attach that cruel instrument of\r\ntorture, the weight and pulley, to the diseased limb.\r\n\r\nAfter many years of practical experience in the treatment of hundreds of\r\ncases, we have developed a system of treatment for this terrible malady\r\nwhich is based upon common sense. Instead of depleting, we, by proper\r\nconstitutional treatment, strengthen and fortify the system. We do not\r\nconfine the patient in bed, but permit him to go around and take all\r\nnecessary exercise. We adjust an ingeniously devised and perfectly\r\nfitting appliance or apparatus, by which a gentle extension of the limb\r\nis maintained, thereby relieving the tension of the muscles, and\r\npreventing the friction and wearing of the inflamed surfaces of the\r\njoint, which, without the use of our new and improved appliance, are a\r\nsource of constant irritation. The appliances required in the successful\r\ntreatment of this disease are numerous and varied in their construction,\r\nand require skill and experience on the part of the surgical mechanic as\r\nwell as on the part of the surgeon, to take accurate and proper\r\nmeasurements of the diseased limb, and to construct the appliances so\r\nthat they will be adapted to the various requirements of different\r\ncases. There are no definite rules for taking these measurements, and\r\nonly a thorough examination of the case can indicate to the eye of the\r\nexperienced surgeon what measurements are required, and what kind of an\r\nappliance is suitable for each individual case. At the Invalids' Hotel\r\nand Surgical Institute these measurements are all taken by the surgeon\r\nin person, and each appliance is constructed under his immediate\r\nsupervision. It is utterly impossible for physicians who have but a\r\nlimited experience in the treatment of such cases to take correct\r\nmeasurements and send off for an apparatus which fulfills the\r\nrequirements of the case.\r\n\r\nIn the light of our vast experience at the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical\r\nInstitute, we feel that we cannot too strongly urge the employment of a\r\nsuitable apparatus for supporting the hip-joint, giving it perfect rest,\r\nand enabling the patient to exercise and get the outdoor air. As much of\r\nthe pain in this disease is due to the pressure of the head of the\r\n_femur_, or thigh-bone, in the _acetabulum_, or socket, steadily-applied\r\nmechanical extension, to relieve the inflamed and sensitive joint of the\r\npressure, is of the greatest importance. By such application the patient\r\nis enabled to move about without pain, while the joint is kept perfectly\r\nat rest--a condition favorable to the reduction of inflammation within\r\nit. The surgeon specialist of the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute\r\nis frequently sent for to visit cases of this disease hundreds of miles\r\naway and by the employment of suitable apparatus he has been enabled, in\r\nscores of cases, to relieve the suffering at once. In cases in which the\r\nhead of the thigh bone, or the bony socket of the joint has become so\r\ndiseased as to cause it to ulcerate and break down, all portions of\r\ndiseased bone should be _thoroughly removed_ by a surgical operation. If\r\nthis be neglected or delayed, a fatal termination of the disease may be\r\nexpected. Parents should not put off the employment of a competent\r\nspecialist in this terrible, distressing, and fatal disease. As treated\r\nby general practitioners, it very often proves fatal; or, after causing\r\nintense suffering for a series of years, if the active condition of the\r\ndisease subsides, the patient is left with a ruined and broken\r\nconstitution, a result which more prompt and earlier relief would have\r\nprevented.\r\n\r\nThe records of practice at the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute\r\nabound in reports of cases, demonstrating the fact, that by careful and\r\njudicious management, hip-joint disease in its earlier stages, may be\r\npromptly arrested, and that cures may be effected even when the bony\r\nstructure of the joint is seriously diseased.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE SWELLING\r\n\r\n\r\nWhite Swelling, otherwise known as _Hydrarthrus_, or _Synovitis_, more\r\nfrequently affects the knee-joint than any other part. The joints of the\r\nelbow, wrist, ankle, or toes, may, however, be affected with this\r\ndisease, but we shall speak of it in this connection as affecting only\r\nthe knee-joint. Synovitis may be acute or chronic. The latter form is\r\nsometimes induced by blows, sprains, falls, etc., or from exposure to\r\ncold; more frequently it is the result of rheumatism or scrofula.\r\n\r\nTHE SYMPTOMS of this affection are generally slow in their appearance,\r\nbeing sometimes months in manifesting themselves. The joint at first\r\npresents only a slight degree of swelling, which gradually increases.\r\nPain is soon felt, mild at first, but augmenting until it becomes\r\nsevere. The skin has a smooth, glistening appearance, and there is an\r\nincreased amount of heat in the parts. The affected limb becomes wasted,\r\nand is sometimes permanently flexed. There is more or less fever about\r\nthe body, impairment of the digestive organs, and sleeplessness. The\r\npulse is low but quick, and night-sweats and diarrhea often appear.\r\nUnder this irritation, the patient is liable to waste away and finally\r\ndie.\r\n\r\nA _post-mortem_ examination reveals the effects of the disease upon the\r\nparts attacked. The cartilages of the joint are soft, the synovial\r\nmembrane is thickened, the ligaments are inflamed and often destroyed,\r\nthe synovial fluid is increased in amount, sometimes normal in\r\nappearance, at others thick and viscous. If the bones be diseased, their\r\narticular extremities may be distended and fatty matter deposited in\r\nthem. The conditions depend upon the form, severity, and duration of the\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nSynovitis may be considered under three heads; Rheumatic, Scrofulous,\r\nand Syphilitic.\r\n\r\n_Rheumatic Synovitis_ may arise from exposure to cold, from some injury,\r\nor from intemperance in eating. The beginning of the disease may be\r\ndistinctly marked, or it may come on so gradually that the time of its\r\ncommencement cannot be noted. The pain is of a dull, steady character,\r\nand less severe in the night. This form of the disease sometimes\r\nterminates favorably, but in scrofulous systems it is liable to end in\r\nthe destruction of the joint. It is more common in early life, rarely\r\noccurring after the thirtieth year.\r\n\r\n_Scrofulous Synovitis_, or _Tuberculosis of the Knee-joint_, when of a\r\nchronic character, shows a wasting of the limb, and the swelling is of a\r\npulpy consistence. This form of the disease is more liable to occur in\r\nchildren, though occasionally it is met with in adults. But little pain\r\naccompanies this form, although the limb is liable to become permanently\r\naffected. In its earlier stages this disease may be checked.\r\n\r\n_Syphilitic Synovitis_ is the result of syphilis. The pain is more\r\nsevere during the night. It, however, generally terminates unfavorably,\r\nespecially in scrofulous constitutions.\r\n\r\nTHE TREATMENT of white swelling should be both constitutional and local.\r\nAlterative medicines are indicated to purify the blood. Doctor Pierce's\r\nGolden Medical Discovery is unequaled for this purpose.\r\n\r\nAs local treatment, in the active stage of the disease, the knee-joint\r\nshould be steamed, and hot fomentations applied. This should be followed\r\nby applications over the joint of solid extract of stramonium or\r\nbelladonna, mixed with glycerine. The joint should be wrapped in cotton\r\nor wool to keep it uniformly warm. If there are openings about the\r\njoint, discharging pus, syringe them out once a day with Castile\r\nsoap-suds, which may be improved by adding a little bicarbonate of\r\npotash (common saleratus). See that the bowels are kept regular, and\r\nthat the diet is nourishing.\r\n\r\nCases of this disease which have been treated at the Invalids' Hotel and\r\nSurgical Institute with uniform success might be cited to the extent of\r\nfilling a very large number of pages like these. When treated by a\r\nskilled specialist, this otherwise formidable and dangerous disease is\r\nreadily amenable to treatment, and good and serviceable limbs can be\r\npromised, even in the extreme cases in which amputation is usually\r\nadvised by general practitioners and surgeons, who desire the glory that\r\nthey imagine they will receive by performing a capital operation.\r\n\r\n\r\nRICKETS. (RACHITIS.)\r\n\r\n\r\nRickets is a scrofulous disease, in which there is derangement of the\r\nentire system, and it finally manifests itself in disease of the bones.\r\nIt is characterized by a softening of the bony tissue, due to a\r\ndeficiency of earthy or calcareous matter in their composition. It\r\nappears to be a disease incident to cold, damp places, ill-lighted and\r\nimperfectly ventilated rooms, and it especially attacks those who are\r\nuncleanly in their habits.\r\n\r\nTHE SYMPTOMS of rickets are severe pains in the bones, especially during\r\nthe night, febrile excitement and profuse perspiration, paleness of the\r\nface, a sallow and wrinkled appearance of the skin, and derangement of\r\nthe digestive organs. After a time the body becomes emaciated, the face\r\npale, and the head unusually large. The bones become soft and unable to\r\nsupport the body; various distortions appear; the extremities of the\r\nlong bones are enlarged, while the limbs between the joints are very\r\nslender. Rickets is a disease peculiar to childhood, though it may not\r\nbe developed until a more advanced period of life. It rarely proves\r\nfatal, unless the lungs, heart, or other vital organs, become involved.\r\nIn some instances the softening and other symptoms continue to increase\r\nuntil every function is affected, and death ensues.\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem_ examinations of those who have died of rickets have\r\ndisclosed morbid changes in the brain, liver, and lymphatic glands. The\r\nlungs are often compressed or displaced, and the muscles of the body\r\nbecome pale and wasted. Sometimes the bones are so soft, on account of\r\nthe deficiency of the calcareous deposit, that they can be easily cut\r\nwith a knife.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. The use of Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery is indicated\r\nin this affection. It is a disease usually developed during childhood,\r\nin consequence of insufficient exercise, deprivation of the sunlight,\r\nlow, innutritious diet, and lack of cleanliness. Therefore, it is\r\nessential to obviate all known causes, and, at the same time supply the\r\npatient with food rich in those elements which the system seems to\r\ndemand. Under any plan of treatment the general directions given for the\r\nhygienic management of scrofula should be followed. We might cite many\r\ncases that have entirely recovered from this disease, under our advice\r\nand the use of \"Golden Medical Discovery.\" We shall merely say, for the\r\nencouragement of the afflicted, that this form of scrofula yields\r\nreadily to this medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD SORES. (CHRONIC ULCERS.)\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder this head we may properly consider that class of affections known\r\nas Fever-sores, Running-sores, Ulcers, etc. These sores have common\r\ncharacteristics, yet each possesses certain peculiarities, which have\r\nled to their division into _irritable, indolent_, and _varicose_. These\r\npeculiarities are not constant, one form of ulcer often changing into\r\nanother. One feature common to all, however, is their slowness in\r\nhealing, which has sometimes led to the belief that they are incurable.\r\nAnother popular notion is that their cure is detrimental to the health\r\nof the patient. With equal propriety we might say that it is dangerous\r\nto cure diarrhea, dysentery, consumption, or cancer. As a result of\r\nthese erroneous impressions, many people suffer from chronic ulcers for\r\nyears, and even for a life-time, without attempting to obtain relief.\r\nChronic ulcers usually appear upon the lower extremities. The depth and\r\nappearance of the ulcer depend upon its character and the thickness of\r\nthe tissues where it is situated. Fig. 2 shows a chronic ulcer, or\r\nfever-sore, as it appears upon the ankle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.\r\nA Chronic Ulcer.]\r\n\r\nTHE IRRITABLE ULCER is painful and tender, the slightest injury causing\r\nit to bleed. It is of a dark purplish hue, and filled with spongy,\r\nsensitive granulations. It discharges a thin, bloody matter which is\r\nsometimes very fetid and acrid, and excoriates the tissues if it comes\r\nin contact with them. The edges of this species of ulcer are shelf-like\r\nand ragged, and turn inward. The adjacent structures are red and\r\nswollen. Very often they are attended by severe constitutional\r\ndisturbances, such as chills, fever, and great nervous prostration and\r\nirritability.\r\n\r\nIN THE INDOLENT ULCER the edges are not undermined, but turned outward,\r\nand are rounded, thick, glossy, and regular. The granulations are broad,\r\nflat, pale, insensible, and covered with a grayish, tenacious matter.\r\nThe surrounding parts are not very sensitive, but the limb on which it\r\nis located is apt to be swollen. This is the commonest form of ulcer,\r\nand often remains for years.\r\n\r\nVARICOSE ULCER. This species of ulcer occasions a swollen or enlarged\r\ncondition of the neighboring veins, which are very much enfeebled. It\r\nalmost invariably appears below the knee, and may be either indolent or\r\nirritable. It is generally sensitive to the touch, and sometimes\r\nexcessively painful. Knots of superficial veins may often be seen\r\nbeneath the skin.\r\n\r\nAs we have before remarked, these various species of ulcers are merely\r\nmodifications of one form of chronic sore. The patient may assert that\r\nhe enjoys excellent health, but if we question him closely, we find that\r\nthe sore irritates him, and that there is sufficient constitutional\r\ndisturbance to prevent the healing powers of nature from effecting a\r\ncure.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. The cure of these sores is necessarily slow, and who ever\r\nexpects to obtain _immediate_ relief will be disappointed.\r\n\r\nConstitutional treatment is of the utmost importance, and should,\r\ntherefore, be thoroughly and persistently applied. The nutritive system,\r\nespecially the absorbents, should be kept active, as these are the\r\nchannels by which the broken-down tissue surrounding the sore is\r\nreplaced by that of a higher grade of vitality. For this purpose, the\r\nbest alteratives or blood cleansing remedies are required. If secretion\r\nand excretion are not normally performed, the blood becomes poisoned by\r\nthe absorption of unhealthy \"matter\" from the sore, and various\r\nconstitutional disturbances occur. If, at any time during treatment,\r\nconstitutional disturbances are manifested by fullness or disagreeable\r\nsensations in the head, nausea, pain, cough, chills, or fever, a\r\nthorough cathartic should be given. If the patient be robust, a\r\nrepetition of the same once a week will be very beneficial. Dr. Pierce's\r\nGolden Medical Discovery, and \"Pellets\" will be productive of the best\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nThe local treatment should depend upon the character of the ulcer. If\r\nthe sore be _irritable_ or painful, soothing applications, such as warm\r\npoultices or steaming in a vapor of bitter herbs, as hops, boneset or\r\nsmart-weed or water pepper, will be found highly beneficial. A poultice\r\nof powdered slippery elm is also very soothing, and hence well adapted\r\nto this purpose. If the ulcer be _indolent_, a stimulating application\r\nis necessary. The hardened, callous state of the edges should be removed\r\nby alkaline applications. A strong solution of saleratus, or even a\r\ncaustic, prepared by boiling the lye from hard-wood ashes to the\r\nconsistence of syrup, will prove of great utility. One or two\r\napplications of the latter are generally sufficient.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing course of treatment is intended to put the open sore or\r\nulcer in what is known to surgeons as a healthy condition--a condition\r\nmost favorable for the healing process.\r\n\r\nBut the open surface of the sore needs something more. It needs the\r\ncleansing or antiseptic and soothing influence of such a dressing as is\r\nfound in Dr. Pierce's All-Healing Salve. If your dealer in medicines\r\ndoes not have this Salve in stock, 25 cents in stamps sent to World's\r\nDispensary Medical Association, Buffalo, N.Y., will secure a box of this\r\nunequaled dressing. It will be sent to your address by return post.\r\nTherefore, do not allow the dealer to put you off with some inferior\r\npreparation. If he has not the All-Healing Salve in stock you can easily\r\nobtain it by sending to us as above directed.\r\n\r\nNo matter how good the local dressing applied to the open sore, or\r\nulcer, do not discontinue the internal use of the \"Golden Medical\r\nDiscovery\" until the affected parts are completely healed.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEVER-SORE. (NECROSIS.)\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the term _necrosis_ we mean mortification, or the state of a bone\r\nwhen it is deprived of life. Dunglison says: \"This condition is to the\r\nbone what _gangrene_ is to the soft parts.\" It is popularly known as\r\n_fever-sore_, there being no distinction made between this species of\r\nsore and those ulcers which affect only the soft tissues of the body.\r\nWhen any part of a bone becomes _necrosed_, it is treated as a foreign\r\nbody. Nature makes an effort for its removal, and at the same time\r\nattempts to replace it with new and healthy materials. In consequence of\r\nthis process, the dead portion is often inclosed in a case of new, sound\r\nbone, termed the _involucrum_; when this is the case the dead portion is\r\ntermed the _sequestrum_. If, however, it be superficial, and separate\r\nfrom the parts beneath, it is called an _exfoliation_. This healing\r\nprocess, by which the involucrum is formed, cannot be completed while\r\nthe dead portion remains. Hence, numerous openings are made through the\r\ninvolucrum, to permit the escape of the sequestrum. When a surgical\r\noperation is performed for the removal of the necrosed bone it is called\r\n_sequestrotomy_. The instruments which our specialists usually employ\r\nfor this practice are represented in Figs. 3, 4, and 5.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.\r\nHand drill for boring bone. ]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.\r\nThe osteotrite, for enlarging openings and cutting carious bone.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.\r\nGouge forceps for excavating bone.]\r\n\r\nCAUSES. Fever-sore may be due to inflammation, injuries, working in\r\nphosphorus, or from the inordinate and protracted use of mercury.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS. The pain frequently commences in the night, and all the\r\ndifferent stages succeed, until, finally, the result is frequently\r\nmortification or death. The entire bone, or only a part of it, may be\r\naffected; the parts become swollen, \"matter\" forms, and unless it be\r\nartificially evacuated, it will in time work its way out through a\r\nfistulous opening. As the disease progresses, the adjacent tissues\r\nbecome thickened and numerous openings are formed, which communicate\r\nwith the bone, and often with each other, so that a probe may be passed\r\nfrom one to another, as represented in Fig. 6, copied from a drawing by\r\nDr. Howe. The discharge from fever-sores varies in character, and\r\nusually has a fetid odor. The surgeon can readily distinguish between\r\nhealthy and unhealthy bone by the use of a probe. The pus discharged in\r\nnecrosis contains minute particles of bone, which may be felt by rubbing\r\nit between the fingers. Sometimes large pieces present themselves at the\r\nopenings. The general health is seriously impaired, and the patient\r\nbecomes debilitated, anæmic, and hectic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.\r\nNecrosis of the tibia. A common\r\nprobe is passed through the sinuses, or openings.]\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. The process of repair is necessarily tedious, and nature\r\nshould be assisted to remove the old bone and promote the formation of\r\nthe new. An alterative course of treatment is indicated and must be\r\npersistently followed. Give Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery and\r\nPleasant Pellets in sufficient doses to keep the bowels regular.\r\nHowever, all efforts to heal the sores, as long as dead bone remains,\r\nwill prove fruitless. The sores should he throughly cleansed with\r\ninjections of an alkaline solution, after which bandages, moistened with\r\nglycerine, may be applied. If they emit a fetid odor, add a few drops of\r\ncarbolic acid to the glycerine. The dead bone can be but slowly removed\r\nby suppuration, therefore time, and, indeed, sometimes life itself, may\r\nbe saved by removing it with surgical instruments. In the operation of\r\nsequestrotomy, the surgeon must exercise great judgment. Carelessness\r\nmay prolong the disease and subsequently necessitate another operation,\r\nor, perhaps, an amputation.\r\n\r\nUsually the dead bone is easily removed by the skilled specialist\r\nsurgeon, and, when thoroughly taken out, the parts readily heal and the\r\npatient rapidly recovers. The removal, therefore, of the dead bone which\r\nis a constant source of irritation, and the cause of protracted\r\nsuffering, should not be delayed, for very rarely indeed can it be\r\nremoved at all without the assistance of the surgeon. Besides, delay\r\noften results in the loss of the limb, and not unfrequently occasions\r\nthe death of the patient. Under the influence of a reliable local\r\n_anæsthetic_, carefully applied, the operation of removing the decayed\r\nand offensive bone is speedily and painlessly performed, the use of\r\nchloroform or ether not generally being required.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONIALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the following letters had been written by your best known and most\r\nesteemed neighbors they could be no more worthy of your confidence than\r\nthey now are, coming, as they do, from well known, intelligent and\r\ntrustworthy citizens, who, in their several neighborhoods, enjoy the\r\nfullest confidence and respect of all who know them.\r\n\r\nOut of thousands of similar letters received from former patrons, we\r\nhave selected these few at random, and have to regret that we can find\r\nroom only for this comparatively small number in this volume.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLOOD DISEASE.\r\n\r\nRAW SORES FROM KNEE TO ANKLE.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Master Amasa Peck]\r\n\r\n_Dear Sirs_--My little boy, Amasa Claude Peck, was severely stricken\r\nwith what the doctors called erysipelas.

I have taken\r\nfive bottles of the \"Golden Medical Discovery,\" and more than that\r\nnumber of the \"Pellets,\" and believe that I am entirely cured. I never\r\nfeel the least itching, or burning, which was at one time so unbearable.\r\nMy appetite and digestion are splendid, and, although I will be seventy\r\nyears old my next birthday, I am as hearty and strong as most men of\r\nfifty.\r\n\r\n    Very truly yours,\r\n    JOSEPH P.

I saw him often\r\nduring the time he was afflicted, as he came to my store often after\r\nmedicine. He purchased the \"Discovery\" and \"Pellets\" from me, and has\r\nbeen one of the strongest champions of your medicines, and thus aided me\r\nvery much in their sale.

As I\r\ngrew older the disease seemed to be taking a stronger hold upon me. I\r\ntried many advertised remedies with no benefit, until I was led to try\r\nyour \"Golden Medical Discovery.\" When I began taking it my health was\r\nvery poor; in fact, several persons have since told me that they thought\r\nI had the consumption. I weighed only about 125 pounds. The eruption on\r\nmy skin was accompanied by severe itching. It was first confined to my\r\nface, but afterwards spread over the neck and head, and the itching\r\nbecame _simply unbearable_. This was my condition when I began taking\r\nthe \"Discovery.\" When I would rub the parts affected a kind of branny\r\nscale would fall off.\r\n\r\nFor a while I saw no change or benefit from taking the \"Discovery,\" but\r\nI persisted in its use, keeping my bowels open by taking the \"Pellets,\"\r\nand taking as much outdoor exercise as was possible, until I begun to\r\ngain in flesh, and gradually the disease released its hold. I took\r\nduring the year somewhere from fifteen to eighteen bottles of the\r\n\"Discovery.\" It has now been four years since I first used it, and\r\nthough not using scarcely any since the first year, my health continues\r\ngood. My average weight being 155 to 160 pounds, instead of 125, as it\r\nwas when I began the use of the \"Discovery.\"\r\n\r\nMany persons have reminded me of my improved appearance. Some say I look\r\nyounger than I did six years ago when I was married. I am now\r\nforty-eight (48) years old, and stronger, and enjoy better health than I\r\nhave ever done before in my life.

I\r\ndoctored with a number of our home physicians and received no benefit\r\nwhatever. I also took treatment from physicians in Rochester, New York,\r\nPhiladelphia, Jersey City, Binghamton, and received no benefit from\r\nthem. In fact I have paid out hundreds of dollars to the doctors without\r\nbenefit. My brother came to visit us from the West and he told me to try\r\nDr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery. He had taken it and it had cured\r\nhim. I have taken ten bottles of the \"Discovery\" and am entirely cured\r\nand if there should be any one wishing any information I would gladly\r\ncorrespond with them.

I took twelve bottles of your\r\nmedicines, six bottles of Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery and the\r\nsame amount of his \"Favorite Prescription.\" Was using them for about six\r\nmonths, and can say that they did their work well. I have ever since\r\nfelt like another person, and do not think I can say enough in their\r\npraise.

Having suffered for three years\r\nfrom salt-rheum and after having been unsuccessfully treated by a good\r\nphysician, I began the use of the \"Discovery.\" The humor was in my\r\nhands. I was obliged to keep a covering on them for months at a time,\r\nchanging the covering morning and night. The stinging, burning and\r\nitching sensation would be so intense that at times it seemed as if I\r\nwould go crazy. When I bent the fingers the flesh would crack open and\r\nbleed. It is impossible for me to describe the intense pain and\r\nsuffering which I endured night and day. After taking six bottles of the\r\n\"Discovery\" I was entirely cured.\r\n\r\n    Respectfully yours,\r\n    MISS LOTTIE CLARK,\r\n    River Falls, Pierce Co., Wis.\r\n\r\n\r\nINVETERATE SKIN DISEASE WORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, 663 Main\r\nSt., Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: M. Allen, Esq.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--I desire to state that I am perfectly well and very\r\nthankful to you for curing me. The medicines which I used for two months\r\nonly have effected a perfect and permanent cure of my case. My face\r\nlooks as well as ever.\r\n\r\nI was six weeks under treatment at the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical\r\nInstitute, and I got first-class accommodation.\r\n\r\nThe case was a strange one. The pimples did not break out on my chin\r\nwhere I had let my beard grow, they broke out on my cheeks, forehead and\r\nnose. A doctor in San Francisco told me it was blood poison and said it\r\nwas very hard to cure it. I think if it were blood poison it would run\r\nall through my system. When I first felt the disease coming on in\r\nwinter--my face used to be very cold. I worked under the sun fourteen\r\nyears every summer. I wore no hat--nothing but a skull cap. I thought I\r\nwas sun-proof. The doctor in San Francisco stopped the disease for one\r\nyear but it came back again. I had it for five years. It came on from\r\nhard work and exposure in the sun.\r\n\r\nWhen my face would break out in the fall it got so itchy, and then\r\nlittle pimples would break out on my face, nose and forehead. I think\r\nparasites were in my face. If I would drink a glass of beer, I would\r\nfeel the effects of it in my face, and tobacco would affect me just the\r\nsame. My face, nose and forehead would be spotted all over like a\r\n\"fiddler's note book,\" every fall for five years. I never saw a case\r\nlike mine. The doctor said if I would get tanned with the sun I would be\r\nall right.\r\n\r\nIn the kind of work I had to do, I could wear no hat.\r\n\r\n    Respectfully yours,\r\n    MICHAEL ALLEN,\r\n    Oro Fino, Siskiyou Co., Cal.\r\n\r\n\r\nCURES BROWN SPOTS.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, NO. 663 Main St., Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mrs. Johnson. ]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--I can say that my health is better now than for the last\r\nfifteen years. I cannot say what my disease was, but I was as spotted as\r\na leopard with brown spots; I was so miserable and nervous, and could\r\nnot sleep. I took Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery one year, and\r\nthe brown spots all disappeared and I am well. Have not taken any\r\nmedicine in two years. I think the \"Golden Medical Discovery\" a splendid\r\nmedicine for stomach, liver and skin disease. I got no help from the\r\nother doctors.

Our family physician was summoned at\r\nthe early stages of the disease and tried everything he knew of for the\r\ncure of the same, but nothing did him any good. The disease baffled the\r\nskill of the doctor in every way, and I was advised by friends to try\r\ncertain remedies, which I did, with very little effect. The child by\r\nthis time was a heart-rendering sight to behold, and suffered unknown\r\nagonies with the torturing itching and burning of the sores, and so\r\nthings ran on until my brother, who resides in Buffalo, visited me. As\r\nsoon as he saw the child he advised me to have him treated at the\r\nInvalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute in Buffalo. I wrote to them\r\nstating my baby's case, asking them if they could help him, and they\r\nthought they could, so began their treatment at once by using salves\r\nexternally and medicine internally and as soon as they began their\r\ntreatment the child began to improve and continued so until he was\r\nentirely cured in six months' time.

All the doctors we consulted said that we would have to\r\nhave an operation performed on her and have the dead bones taken out, or\r\nelse she could not get well, with the exception of one of the doctors\r\nwho said that if her health could be improved the dead bones would come\r\nout and be replaced with new ones, for the dead pieces would brake loose\r\nfrom the sound bone and come out through the opening with the matter;\r\nbut he could not do anything to improve her health.\r\n\r\nAfter doctoring her three months she was reduced to a mere skeleton and\r\nhad to be tended to like a mere baby and have her feet elevated, or else\r\nshe would scream with pain. We commenced giving her Dr. Pierce's Golden\r\nMedical Discovery. After using it for one month we could see, for the\r\nfirst time, that she was getting no worse, and after using about five\r\nbottles her health began to improve a little; but she still suffered\r\nwith pain and could not have her feet down until she had taken twelve\r\nbottles. When she had taken fifteen bottles--she began to walk on\r\ncrutches, and later with a cane, for about two or three months, when she\r\ncould walk without a crutch or cane. The diseased bones gradually came\r\nout in pieces, some of them an inch to two inches long and one-fourth of\r\nan inch thick; the sores healed as soon as the last dead bone was out.\r\nShe is now a strong healthy young lady as her photograph plainly shows.\r\n\r\n    Respectfully yours,\r\n    D.R.

For near two years he never\r\nwalked. He suffered from a running sore on his leg, and after using\r\ntwelve bottles, he could walk all right and is well to-day The doctors\r\nwanted to have it taken off. You say in your letter you would like to\r\nhave a photograph. I have none and there is no photograph gallery in\r\nthis village or I would have one taken.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly,\r\n    Mrs Isaac Brady\r\n\r\n\r\nECZEMA.\r\n\r\nDR. R.V. PIERCE, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n_Dear Sir_--When I was married I weighed 125 pounds. I was taken sick\r\nwith a disease which my doctor said was eczema. He failed to do me any\r\ngood, and I fell away to 90 pounds. I had dyspepsia so bad that I could\r\nnot eat anything. My husband got me \"sarsaparillas\" and \"cures\" and\r\n\"bitters,\" and nothing did me any good. Finally he got two bottles of\r\nDr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery. I began using it, and, thank God\r\nand you, I improved; now I weigh 140 pounds, and my skin is as smooth as\r\na baby's. My husband says I look younger than I did the first time he\r\nsaw me. I have better health than ever, and I owe it all to you. It is a\r\nmiracle that I am cured. I cannot say too much about the medicine.\r\n\r\n    Very respectfully,\r\n    Rebecca F.

As a\r\nresult of the grippe I had dropsy, and ulcers formed on my legs with a\r\nmost intolerable itching at night after going to bed. My circulation was\r\nvery poor and liver inactive. I feel perfectly well since I took the\r\nmedicine. The old sores on my legs are all healed up, and I feel like a\r\nnew man. I highly recommend your \"Golden Medical Discovery\" to any\r\ninquiring person, for it has saved my life.\r\n\r\n    Yours very truly,\r\n    FRED.

There was a decided change after using\r\nDr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery. I took a few bottles and was soon\r\ncured Later my husband had a lump behind his ear; he tried your\r\nmedicine, and one bottle cured him. I shall always recommend your\r\nmedicines.\r\n\r\n    Yours respectfully,\r\n    MRS. L.

PIERCE, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n_Dear Sir_--Your \"Golden Medical Discovery\" has proven a blessing to me.\r\nIt was recommended to me by Rev. P.A. Kuykendall. I have been a sufferer\r\nwith old sores on my legs for four years. I used three bottles of it,\r\nand my legs are sound and well and my health is better than it has been\r\nfor some time.

Rush.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--At the age of eight years I became afflicted with\r\n\"Hip-joint Disease.\" For a year I suffered as much as it was possible\r\nfor a human being to suffer. My physicians told me I would have to wait\r\npatiently, but my father procured me some of Doctor Pierce's Golden\r\nMedical Discovery, and I found my falling health restored.\r\n\r\nI can cheerfully say that I believe I owe my life to the use of that\r\nvaluable medicine.\r\n\r\n    Your true friend,\r\n    EDWARD J. RUSH,\r\n    Elizabeth, Harrison Co. Ind.\r\n\r\n\r\nHIP-JOINT DISEASE CURED.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mrs. Ridgley.]\r\n\r\nMISS MARY E. RIDGLEY, of _Gales Creek, Washington Co., Oregon_, when\r\nonly three years old, had lameness in one of her lower limbs but the use\r\nof liniment and Dr. Pierce's Pellets relieved her, and she got better.\r\nWhen six years old the trouble developed into hip-joint disease, so\r\npronounced by her physician. She lost the use of the limb. Was three\r\nmonths under the doctors, but got no better. She complained of great\r\npain in the limb, especially in the knee and hip. The limb wasted away,\r\nbecoming small and short, and her back became crooked. She had no\r\nappetite; was very weak. Hip and knee were very tender to the touch.\r\nPhysician's treatment not helping her, her mother began to give her\r\n\"Golden Medical Discovery.\" Four months afterwards she wrote Dr. Pierce\r\nas follows: \"She is growing fast, and never complains of any pain or\r\nache. She sleeps well, and eats heartily. Her leg has filled up, and is\r\nas big as the other. She plays around all day with the other children.\r\nEverybody is astonished to see how she has improved.\"\r\n\r\nIn the margin we print Miss Ridgley's picture as she appears twelve\r\nyears after this treatment, at the age of eighteen. The young lady\r\nherself, writes Dr. Pierce as follows: \"Your medicines are worth their\r\nweight in gold. I was cured of hip-joint disease by the \"Golden Medical\r\nDiscovery\" and \"Pellets,\" and I feel sure that they can cure the worst\r\ncases if given a chance.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHIP-JOINT DISEASE OF 11 YEARS' STANDING.\r\n\r\nP.O. Box 128, Gagetown, Tuscola Co., Mich.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--When I began taking your medicines I was in bed, nothing\r\nwould relieve me, my hip being swelled seemingly ready to burst. When I\r\nbegan to take Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery and \"Pellets,\" the\r\nswelling gradually decreased; when I had taken one bottle I was able to\r\nbe up. I don't know how long I will remain well, but I am satisfied that\r\nit is the medicine that did the work: I take it right along; as long as\r\nI can keep the way I am now, I am satisfied. I have recommended your\r\nremedies, and will continue to do so.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly,\r\n    H.F.

Adams said could never be cured).\r\n\r\nI do hope that by so doing some little one may escape the misery my\r\nlittle one suffered for over a year until I began the use of the \"Golden\r\nMedical Discovery.\" I followed your directions found in the little book\r\naround the bottles. Before the first bottle was gone, he could eat and\r\nsleep without that coughing and choking that, before the use of the\r\n\"Discovery,\" was impossible.\r\n\r\nThe tumor began to lessen in size, and after the third bottle I would\r\nnever have known he ever had a tumor there. He is now hearty and\r\nhealthy. Sleeps as good as any child and is full of life. He does not\r\ntake anything to prevent a return, and has not for over a year.\r\n\r\nI have one of your Common Sense Medical Advisers, and found it worth\r\nfive times what I gave for it; I have helped others to get it and the\r\n\"Medical Discovery\" and \"Favorite Prescription\" have brought relief to\r\nmany through me I use the \"Prescription\" off and on; it has given me\r\nstrength; I think I should have been an invalid long ago without it.\r\n\r\nEvery one here knows the truth of this letter, and I would tell it to\r\nthe world if I could.

TWO BOTTLES ONLY, CURE.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Col. T.U. Fogg.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--For about eight or ten years my father was laid up with\r\ncarbuncles, the worst that I ever saw. He tried everything he heard of,\r\nand his doctor did everything he could for him, but nothing did him any\r\ngood. Had six or seven carbuncles at a time, as large as a hen's egg; he\r\ngot so weak and suffered so much he could not walk a step. It was in the\r\nsummer of '72 or '73 that he had his bed put in the middle of his\r\nchamber and got on it to die. No one expected him to get well. Looking\r\nover the newspapers, he saw your \"Golden Medical Discovery\" advertised,\r\nand the good it had done. There was not any sold then in the country, so\r\nhe sent to Richmond--forty-five miles--and got a bottle. When he began\r\nto take it he was nearly covered with carbuncles--little and big\r\ntogether. Before he had taken half-a-bottle they began to go away.\r\nBefore he had taken two bottles he was entirely cured, and he has never\r\nbeen bothered with them since. Every time he sees any sign of them, he\r\ngets a bottle of \"Golden Medical Discovery\" and it cures them. My\r\nfather, Col. T.U. Fogg, lives in West Point, King William Co., Va. He is\r\nnow seventy-eight years old, and enjoys good health.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly,\r\n    Mrs. NANNIE GOULDMAN,\r\n    Beulahville, King William Co., Va.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHICK NECK. (GOITRE.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThick neck, or goitre, also sometimes called bronchocele, consists of an\r\nenlargement of the thyroid gland, which lies over and on each side of\r\nthe trachea, or windpipe, between the prominence known as \"Adam's apple\"\r\nand the breast bone. The tumor gradually increases in front and\r\nlaterally, until it produces great deformity, and often interferes with\r\nrespiration and the act of swallowing. From its pressure on the great\r\nblood-vessels running to and from the head, there is a constant\r\nliability to engorgement of blood in the brain, and to apoplexy,\r\nepilepsy, etc. When the enlargement once makes its appearance, it\r\ncontinues to increase in size as long as the person lives, unless\r\nappropriate treatment be resorted to. It never disappears spontaneously.\r\nThese tumors are much larger than those not familiar with them would\r\nsuppose from their outward appearance, as they extend under and are\r\nbound down by the muscles on each side of the neck, so that they become\r\nembedded in the cellular tissues underneath, while the sides of the neck\r\nretain, to a considerable extent, their round and even appearance,\r\nwhereby the real magnitude of the tumor is not apparent. Figure 7\r\nrepresents the appearance of the neck of a person afflicted with this\r\ndisease. The form of protuberance varies materially with different\r\npersons, that shown in the engraving being the shape which it ordinarily\r\nassumes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.]\r\n\r\nThe causes of the affection are not well understood. The use of\r\nsnow-water, or water impregnated with some particular saline or\r\ncalcareous matter, has been assigned as a cause. It has also been\r\nattributed to the use of water in which there is not a trace of iron,\r\niodine, or bromine. A writer in a Swiss journal, _Feuilles d' Hygiene_,\r\nstates that the disease is often due to an impeded circulation in the\r\nlarge veins of the neck, from pressure of the clothing, or from the head\r\nbeing bent forward, a position which is often seen in school children,\r\nwhen the muscles of the back of the neck have become fatigued.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. We have obtained wonderful results by a new method of\r\ntreatment, which consists in the employment of electrolysis in\r\nconjunction with other therapeutic means. There is scarcely a case in\r\nwhich this treatment, properly carried out, will not effect a radical\r\ncure. It is attended with no danger whatever.\r\n\r\nThose who are afflicted with this disease and unable to avail themselves\r\nof special treatment, cannot do better than to take Dr. Pierce's\r\nAlterative Extract, or Golden Medical Discovery, and apply to the skin\r\nover and around the tumor, night and morning the following solution\r\nwhich may be prepared at any drug store: iodine, one drachm; iodide of\r\npotassium, four drachms; dissolve in three ounces of soft water. Apply\r\nto the tumor twice a day, with a feather or hair pencil.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUMPS. (PAROTITIS.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is an inflammation of the parotid glands and generally occurs in\r\nchildhood. It is often epidemic, and is manifestly contagious. It\r\nusually, though not always, appears on both sides of the neck at the\r\nsame time.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS. An external, movable swelling, just below and in front of the\r\near, near the angle of the jaw, is the prominent symptom. The\r\nenlargement is not circumscribed, but hard and painful, and attended\r\nwith more or less fever, derangement of the secretions, and difficulty\r\nin swallowing. The swelling increases until the fourth and fifth day,\r\nwhen it gradually diminishes, and by the eighth or tenth is entirely\r\ngone. Sometimes the disease is accompanied by swelling of the breasts in\r\nthe female, or the testicles in the male.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. Usually but little treatment is necessary. Exposure to cold\r\nshould be avoided. If severe or painful, with febrile symptoms, a hot\r\nfoot-bath and small doses of the \"Compound Extract of Smart-Weed,\" in\r\nsome diaphoretic infusion, to induce sweating, together with small doses\r\nof aconite, will produce good results. If swelling of the testicles\r\nthreatens (which seldom happens except on taking cold), resort should be\r\nhad to mild cathartics, the spirit vapor-bath, stimulating liniments to\r\nthe neck, and warm fomentations to the part attacked If delirium occurs,\r\na physician should be summoned.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLUENZA, OR LA GRIPPE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is an infectious disease, characterized by depression, and usually\r\nassociated with a catarrhal condition of the mucous membrane. It may\r\naffect the respiratory organs or the intestinal canal. There is a marked\r\nliability to serious complications, of which pneumonia is the most\r\ndangerous. The disease is evidently due to a specific virus of great\r\ninfectiveness, and is more active and contagious at certain seasons and\r\nunder certain conditions of the atmosphere. By some it has been supposed\r\nthat it is due to a miasma in the air, but the character of its\r\ninfection indicates that the true virus is of a germinal nature.\r\n\r\nUncomplicated cases recover, but in the aged and in the delicate we may\r\nsee fatal results, due usually to the profound depression or the high\r\ntemperature to which the individual is subjected. There is much redness\r\nand swelling of the mucous membranes of the nose and throat--a\r\nbronchitis--and a catarrhal state of the stomach and intestines. These\r\nmay all be present, or the disease may center upon one particular\r\nportion of the animal economy, and manifest its ravages there alone.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS. The attack usually resembles an ordinary catarrh of cold. In\r\nsome cases the nasal catarrh is absent, or very mild, and the infection\r\ninvades the general system, with much fever. A very striking\r\nmanifestation of the disease is the severe nervous troubles which are\r\npresent at the outset, consisting of headache, pain in the back and\r\nlegs, and a general soreness of the muscles and bones as if bruised or\r\nbeaten. The pulse is usually feeble and small--intermittent. The disease\r\nmay center in the brain, producing delirium. Mental disorders are not\r\nuncommon, and there is usually following the disease more or less\r\ninaptitude for mental work and a tendency to depression of spirits. In\r\nmany cases there is a severe diarrhea, and the individual suffers much\r\nfrom pain and discomfort in the abdomen. This is a gastro-intestinal\r\nirritation, and apparently favors an early recovery, and usually there\r\nare less severe sequels in such cases.\r\n\r\nThe most dangerous complication is pneumonia. These cases may follow\r\nbronchitis, or the grip may begin with well-characterized symptoms of\r\nthis disease, for which see the chapters upon this trouble. The sputa\r\nmay not be rusty until after several days. The crisis is usually slow,\r\nand a considerable proportion recover, the disease frequently showing a\r\nsudden change for the better, and the patient being up and around in a\r\nfew days. Cases complicated with pneumonia are the most indefinite in\r\ntheir symptoms, and require the closest attention.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. In every case the disease must be regarded as a dangerous\r\none, and the patient be confined to bed and indoors until all fever has\r\ndisappeared, otherwise sudden and serious manifestations are liable to\r\nappear at any time. The patient must be well fed and nourished from the\r\noutset. The bowels should be acted upon by mild laxatives, such as\r\ncastor oil or Dr. Pierce's Pleasant Pellets, using from one to three. It\r\nis also of advantage afterward to move them twice each day, by the\r\ninjection of warm water, to which has been added a teaspoonful of table\r\nsalt to each pint. This injected into the rectum, using the water\r\nslightly tepid, or cool if the patient is feverish, will tend to soften\r\nthe actions from the bowels and favor the escape of poisonous matter.\r\nThe cool water has also a soothing effect upon the fever and nervous\r\nsystem. If the fever is high, and there is delirium, small doses of\r\naconite, with water, should be used every half hour or hour, but all\r\ndepressing agents of this kind must be used with caution, as profound\r\nprostration sometimes develops. Warm baths, repeated frequently, and\r\nfollowed by hot lemonade, are of the greatest benefit in reducing the\r\nfeverish condition and quieting the patient. The bed should be warmed\r\nafter these are administered and the patient given hot lemonade to bring\r\non free action of the skin, kidneys, and bowels. Where the pulse is\r\nweak, the free use of stimulants, as wine, coffee, tea, and brandy or\r\nwhiskey, are required, as the great danger of the disease is a\r\ndepression of the heart. In severe bronchitis, pneumonia, and other\r\ncomplications, appropriate treatment should be applied.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACUTE NASAL CATARRH.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcute Nasal Catarrh, or cold in the head, is an acute inflammation of\r\nthe mucous membrane lining the nasal passage which may confine itself to\r\nthese parts or extend to the pharynx, larynx, and air-passages below, or\r\naffect the auxiliary sinuses or cavities communicating with the nasal\r\npassages.\r\n\r\nThe most frequent cause of cold in the head is exposure to sudden\r\nchanges in temperature, or draughts of cool air, without taking proper\r\nprecaution to protect the body so as to prevent the rapid radiation of\r\nanimal heat. In most cases there is an inherited tendency or acquired\r\nweakness, which frequently may be associated with a scrofulous condition\r\nof the whole system, that render these points less resistant, and\r\nconsequently invite the morbid changes which result from exposure and\r\ncold. Acute Catarrh also occurs during the initial stage of such\r\neruptive diseases as measles, typhus, typhoid, erysipelas, etc.\r\n\r\nSeldom do we meet with an otherwise healthy individual, who is subjected\r\nto a frequent cold in the head. Impure blood, inherited scrofulous\r\ntaints, enfeebled circulation, debility, either general or nervous, are\r\nall advance agents, inviting catarrhal disease, and preventing rapid\r\nrecovery from an acute attack, so that a low grade of Chronic Catarrh is\r\ngenerally the sequence.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS. The attack is visually ushered in by a chill, or chilly\r\nsensation, feeling of lassitude, followed by a slight fever. These\r\nsymptoms are not as distressing as the sense of fullness about the eyes\r\nand frontal region, and prickling dry heat, with more or less\r\nobstruction in the nostrils. A few hours later follows a copious, acrid\r\nwatery discharge, which gradually becomes thick and yellow. Often the\r\ninflammatory action may extend to the orifice of the eustachian tube,\r\ncausing obstruction with temporary deafness, or ringing in the ears.\r\nSevere facial neuralgia may be caused by the pressure from the swollen\r\nparts upon the branches of sensitive nerves.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. In the mild forms of acute catarrh, or coryza, only simple\r\ntreatment is required. A hot foot-bath on retiring at night, with a full\r\ndose of Dr. Pierce's Compound Extract of Smart-weed, to produce free\r\nperspiration will generally break up the attack. Should the discharge\r\nfrom the nostrils continue, Dr. Sage's Catarrh Remedy should be freely\r\nused four to six times each day, until the symptoms are controlled. In\r\ncase the bowels do not act, a full dose of Dr. Pierce's Pleasant Pellets\r\nmay he taken at bed-time. Avoidance of exposure to cold, and light\r\nvegetable diet, are advisable. In the more severe attacks, especially\r\nwhen complicated by laryngeal or bronchial symptoms, the most decisive\r\nmeasures should be employed. The Compound Extract of Smart-weed should\r\nbe taken freely, together with hot drinks, or a hot general bath. The\r\npatient should be warmly covered in bed to encourage a continued\r\nperspiration, to equalize the circulation, and subdue the inflammation.\r\nDr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery should be taken in teaspoonful\r\ndoses four times each day in all cases that are complicated or\r\nprotracted.\r\n\r\nIndividuals suffering from frequent colds will do wisely to fortify\r\ntheir systems by taking a few bottles of the \"Golden Medical Discovery\"\r\nto improve nutrition, purify the blood, and thus aid nature in\r\novercoming such inherited tendency or required weakness as may be their\r\nmisfortune to possess. Remember frequent attacks of Acute Catarrh\r\nprepare fertile soil for the chronic form which oftentimes is so\r\nloathsome and destructive.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONIC NASAL CATARRH.\r\n\r\n\r\nOZAENA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn consequence of repeated attacks of acute catarrh, or \"cold in the\r\nhead,\" as it is usually termed, the mucous membranes of the nose and the\r\nair-passages of the head become permanently thickened, the mucous\r\nfollicles or glands diseased, and their functions either destroyed or\r\nvery much deranged. Although chronic catarrh is most commonly brought on\r\nin the manner above stated, it sometimes makes its appearance as a\r\nsequel of typhoid fever, scarlet fever, measles, or other eruptive\r\nfevers, or shows itself as a local manifestation of scrofulous or\r\nsyphilitic taints in the system.\r\n\r\nInjury to the nose may result in a displacement of one or more of the\r\nbony structures, setting up a chronic inflammation with catarrh at that\r\npoint. In the early stages of the disease, the patient may be annoyed\r\nwith \"only a slight dropping into the throat,\" as many express it, the\r\namount of the discharges from the air-passages of the head at this stage\r\nof the disease being only slightly in excess of health. In some cases\r\nthe discharge is thick, ropy, and tough, requiring frequent and strong\r\nefforts in the way of blowing and spitting, to remove it from the\r\nthroat, in which it frequently lodges. In other cases, or in other\r\nstages of the same case, the discharge is thin, watery, acrid,\r\nirritating, and profuse. The nose may be \"stopped up\" from the swollen\r\nand thickened condition of the lining mucous membrane, so as to\r\nnecessitate respiration through the mouth, giving to the voice a\r\ndisagreeable nasal twang. From the nature of the obstruction in this\r\ncondition, it is useless for the sufferer to endeavor to clear the\r\npassage by blowing the nose; this only tends to render a bad matter\r\nworse, by increasing the irritation and swelling of the already\r\nthickened lining membrane. The swelling of the mucous membrane does not\r\nin all cases become so great as to cause obstruction to respiration\r\nthrough the affected passages. In some cases, the patient suffers from\r\nhead ache a great portion of the time, or experiences a dull, heavy,\r\ndisagreeable fullness or pressure in the head, with a confusion of his\r\nideas, which renders him quite unfit for business, especially such as\r\nrequires deep thought and mental labor. Memory may be more or less\r\naffected, and the disposition of those who are otherwise amiable is\r\noften rendered irritable or morose and despondent. The mental faculties\r\nsuffer to such an extent in some cases as to result in insanity. The\r\nsense of smell is in many cases impaired, and sometimes entirely lost,\r\nand the senses of taste and hearing are not unfrequently more or less\r\naffected.\r\n\r\nOZÆNA. The ulcerous or more aggravated stage of the disease, from the\r\noffensive odor that frequently attends it, is denominated _Ozæna_.\r\n\r\nThe secretion which is thrown out in the more advanced stages of chronic\r\ncatarrh becomes so acrid, unhealthy, and poisonous, that it produces\r\nsevere irritation and inflammation, which are followed by excoriation\r\nand ulceration of the delicate membrane which lines the air-passages in\r\nthe head. Although commencing in this membrane, the ulceration is not\r\nconfined to it, but gradually extends in depth, until it frequently\r\ninvolves all the component structures of the nose--cartilage and bone,\r\nas well as fibrous tissues. As the ulceration extends up among the small\r\nbones, the discharge generally becomes profuse and often excessively\r\nfetid, requires the frequent use of the handkerchief, and renders the\r\npoor sufferer disagreeable to both himself and those with whom he\r\nassociates. Thick, tough, brownish incrustations, or hardened lumps, are\r\nmany times formed in the head, by the evaporation of the watery portion\r\nof the discharge. These lumps are sometimes so large and tough that it\r\nis with great difficulty that they can be removed. They are usually\r\ndischarged every second, fourth, or fifth day, but only to be succeeded\r\nby another crop. Portions of cartilage and bone, or even entire bones,\r\noften die, slough away, and are discharged, either in large flakes, or\r\nblackened, half-decayed, and crumbly pieces; or, as is much more\r\ncommonly the case, in the form of numerous minute particles, that escape\r\nwith the discharge and are unobserved. It is painfully unpleasant to\r\nwitness the ravages of this terrible disease, and observe the extent to\r\nwhich it sometimes progresses. Holes are eaten through the roof of the\r\nmouth, and great cavities excavated into the solid bones of the face; in\r\nsuch cases only the best and most through treatment will check the\r\nprogress and fatal termination of the disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPLICATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCatarrh, or ozaena, is liable to be complicated, not only by the system,\r\nblood, and fluids, suffering from scrofulous or other taints, as has\r\nalready been pointed out, but also by an extension of the diseased\r\nconditions to other parts beyond the air-passages of the head.\r\n\r\nOccasionally deformities of the septum or other internal structures also\r\npolypi or tumors, are sources of constant irritation and accelerate\r\ncatarrhal disease.\r\n\r\nDISEASE OF THE THROAT. The acrid, irritating and poisonous discharge,\r\nwhich, in some stages of disease, almost constantly runs down over the\r\ndelicate lining membrane of the _pharynx_ (throat), is liable to produce\r\nin this sensitive membrane a diseased condition similar to that existing\r\nin the air-passages of the head. The throat may feel dry, husky, and at\r\ntimes slightly sore or raw; or, from the muco-purulent discharge that is\r\nalmost constantly dropping down over its surface, the patient may feel\r\nvery little inconvenience from the disease of the throat until it is far\r\nadvanced--the moistening and lubricating effect of the matter that drops\r\non the surface tending to blunt the sensibility of the parts. (_See\r\npharyngitis for symptoms and treatment_.)\r\n\r\nTHE EXTENSION OF THE DISEASE TO THE LARYNX. The larynx, situated\r\ndirectly below the pharynx (throat), is subjected to the influence of\r\nthe same irritation from acrid and poisonous discharges dropping into\r\nthe throat from the head. More or less of it is removed by hawking and\r\nspitting, but some remains and is drawn into the larynx, or still lower\r\ninto the trachea (windpipe), with the inspired air. Thus the disease\r\ncreeps along the continuous mucous surfaces of the air-passages, the\r\nacrid poisonous discharge arousing in its track the irritation,\r\ninflammation, ulceration, and thickening of the lining membrane which\r\ncharacterize the disease in other portions of the air-passages. The\r\nsymptoms and treatment of laryngitis will be found under its appropriate\r\nclassification.\r\n\r\nBRONCHITIS AND CONSUMPTION. We have already detailed the manner in which\r\nthe throat, larynx, and trachea, in succession, become affected from\r\ncatarrh, or ozaena. By the same process of extension, the bronchial\r\ntubes, and lastly, the _parenchyma_, or substance of the lungs, in their\r\nturn, become diseased, and bronchitis and consumption are firmly\r\nestablished. Tightness in the chest, with difficulty of breathing;\r\nsoreness; darting, sharp, or dull, heavy pain, or a prickly, distressing\r\nsensation, accompanied with more or less cough and expectoration--are\r\nevidences that the bronchial tubes have become affected, and they should\r\nadmonish the sufferer _that he is now standing on the stepping-stone to_\r\nCONSUMPTION, over which thousands annually tread, in their slow journey\r\nto the grave.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.\r\nInternal and external ear. _1_, External ear.\r\n_2_, Internal auditory meatus. _3_, Tympanum. _4_, Labyrinth.\r\n_5_, Eustachian tube.]\r\n\r\nDEAFNESS. By means of a small canal, called the _eustachian tube_, an\r\nair-passage and communication between the throat and middle ear is\r\nformed. (See Fig. 8.) This passage is lined by a continuation of the\r\nmucous membrane which covers the throat and nasal passages. The\r\ncatarrhal inflammatory process, by continuity of surface, follows the\r\nmucous membrane, thickening its structure, until the eustachian tube is\r\nclosed, and the beautiful mechanism of the internal ear is rendered\r\nuseless. While the thickening of the mucous membrane is going on, and\r\nthe passage is gradually becoming closed (and the process sometimes\r\nextends through several years), the patient will occasionally, while\r\nblowing the nose, experience a crackling in one or both ears, and\r\nhearing becomes dull, but returns suddenly, accompanied with a snapping\r\nsound. This may be repeated many times, until, finally, hearing does not\r\nreturn, but remains permanently injured. In other cases the hearing is\r\nlost so gradually that a considerable degree of deafness may exist\r\nbefore the person is really aware of the fact. Either condition is often\r\naccompanied with noises in the head of every conceivable description,\r\nincreasing the distress of the sufferer. The delicate bones of the ear\r\nare sometimes detached from their articulations, the drum is ulcerated\r\nand perforated, and through the orifice thus made, the bones or small\r\n_spiculæ_ may escape with the thick, purulent, and offensive discharge.\r\n\r\nCLOSURE OF THE TEAR DUCT. The lachrymal duct, or passage (tear duct),\r\nwhich, when in a healthy condition, serves to convey the tears from the\r\neye into the nose, may be closed by the same inflammatory and thickening\r\nprocess which we have already explained. This condition is usually\r\nattended with watery and weak eyes, the tears escaping over the cheeks,\r\nand sometimes producing irritation and excoriation. The nasal branch of\r\nthe ophthalmic nerve sometimes participates in the ulceration going on\r\nin the head, so that the eyes are sympathetically affected. They\r\nsometimes become congested or inflamed, and sharp pain in the eyeballs\r\nmay be experienced.\r\n\r\nINDIGESTION, DYSPEPSIA, ETC. A large portion of the acrid, poisonous,\r\npurulent discharge, which drops into the throat during sleep, is\r\nswallowed. This disturbs the functions of the stomach, causing weakness\r\nof that organ, and producing indigestion, dyspepsia, nausea, and loss of\r\nappetite. Many sufferers complain of a very distressing \"gnawing\r\nsensation\" in the stomach, or an \"all gone,\" or \"faint feelings,\" as\r\nthey often express it.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS. Dull, heavy headaches through the temples and above the eyes;\r\nindisposition to exercise; difficulty of thinking or reasoning, or\r\nconcentrating the mind upon any subject; lassitude; indifference\r\nrespecting business, lack of ambition or energy; obstruction of nasal\r\npassages; discharges voluntarily falling into the throat, sometimes\r\nprofuse, watery, acrid, thick and tenacious, mucous, purulent,\r\nmuco-purulent, bloody, concrete blood and pus, putrid, offensive, etc.\r\nIn others, a dryness of the nasal passages: dry, watery, weak, or\r\ninflamed eyes; ringing in the ears, deafness, discharge from the ears,\r\nhawking and coughing to clear the throat, ulcerations, death and decay\r\nof bones, expectoration of putrid matter, _spiculæ_ of bones, scabs from\r\nulcers leaving surface raw, constant desire to clear the nose and\r\nthroat, voice altered, nasal twang, offensive breath, impairment or\r\ntotal deprivation of the sense of smell and taste, dizziness, mental\r\ndepression, loss of appetite, nausea, indigestion, dyspepsia, enlarged\r\ntonsils, raw throat, tickling cough, difficulty in speaking plainly,\r\ngeneral debility, idiocy, and insanity.\r\n\r\nAll the above symptoms, as well as some others which have been\r\npreviously given, and which it is not necessary here to repeat, are\r\ncommon to this disease in some of its stages or complications; yet\r\nthousands of cases annually terminate in consumption or chronic\r\nbronchitis, and end in the grave, without ever having manifested\r\none-half of the symptoms enumerated.\r\n\r\nVARIETIES. People often suppose that there are a great many varieties or\r\nspecies of catarrh. This is an error. The nature of the disease is the\r\nsame in all cases, the symptoms only varying with the different stages\r\nof the disorder, and the various complicated conditions which are liable\r\nto arise, and which have already been pointed out.\r\n\r\nCAUSES. Anything which debilitates the system, or diminishes its powers\r\nof evolving animal heat and withstanding cold or sudden changes of\r\natmospheric temperature, and other disease-producing agencies, renders\r\nthe individual thus enfeebled very liable to catarrh. Among the most\r\ncommon debilitating agencies are a scrofulous condition of the system,\r\nor other impurities of the blood, exhaustive fevers, and other\r\nprostrating acute diseases, or those badly treated; exhaustive and\r\nunnatural discharges, intemperance, excessive study, self-abuse,\r\nadversity, grief, want of sleep, syphilitic taints of the system, which\r\nmay have been contracted unknowingly, or may have been inherited, having\r\nperhaps been handed down even unto the third or fourth generation, to an\r\ninnocent posterity from infected progenitors; too sudden rest after\r\ngreat and fatiguing exercise, and living in poorly-ventilated\r\napartments. These are among the most fruitful causes of those feeble,\r\nderanged, or impure conditions of the system to which catarrh so\r\nfrequently owes its origin. Although the immediate or exciting cause is\r\ngenerally repeated attacks of \"cold in the head,\" which, being neglected\r\nor improperly treated; \"go on from bad to worse,\" yet the predisposing\r\nor real cause of the disease is in the majority of cases, an enfeebled,\r\nimpure, or otherwise faulty condition of the system, which invites the\r\ndisease, and needs only the irritation produced in the nasal passages by\r\nan attack of cold, to kindle the flame and establish the loathsome\r\nmalady. Some people are convinced with difficulty that there exists in\r\ntheir system a weakness, impurity, or derangement of any kind, which\r\npermitted the disease to fasten itself upon them. They may not feel any\r\ngreat weakness, may not have any pimples, blotches, eruptions,\r\nswellings, or ulcers, upon their whole person; in fact, nothing about\r\nthem that would, except to the skilled eye of the practical and\r\nexperienced physician, indicate that their system is weakened or\r\nderanged with bad humors; and yet such a fault may, and GENERALLY DOES,\r\nexist. As an ulcer upon the leg, or a \"fever-sore,\" or an eruption upon\r\nthe skin, may be the only outward sign of a fault in the system, so\r\nfrequently chronic catarrh is the only sign by which a bad condition of\r\nthe system manifests itself in a manner that is perceptible to the\r\nsufferer himself, or to the non-professional observer. The\r\nfinely-skilled physician, whose constant practice makes his perceptive\r\nfaculties perfect in this direction, would detect the constitutional\r\nfault, as an experienced banker detects a finely-executed and dangerous\r\nbank-note which the unpracticed eye would pronounce genuine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.\r\nExamination of the Nasal Passages by means of the Rhinoscope\r\nand Head Mirror.]\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. If you would remove an evil _strike at its root_. As the\r\npredisposing or real cause of catarrh is, in the majority of cases, some\r\nweakness, impurity, or otherwise faulty condition of the system, in\r\nattempting to cure the disease our chief aim must be directed to the\r\nremoval of that cause. The more we see of this odious disease, the more\r\nso we the importance of combining; with the use of a local, soothing and\r\nhealing application, a thorough and persistent internal use of\r\nblood-cleansing and tonic medicines.\r\n\r\nAs a local application for healing the diseased condition in the head,\r\nDr. Sage's Catarrh Remedy is beyond all comparison the best preparation\r\never invented. It is mild and pleasant to use, producing no smarting or\r\npain, and containing no strong, irritating, or caustic drug, or other\r\npoison. Its ingredients are simple and harmless, yet when scientifically\r\nand skillfully combined, in just the right proportions, they form a most\r\nwonderful and valuable healing medicine. Like gunpowder, which is formed\r\nof a combination of saltpeter, sulphur, and charcoal, the ingredients\r\nare simple, but the product of their combination is wonderful in its\r\neffects. The Remedy is a powerful antiseptic, and speedily destroys all\r\nbad smell which accompanies so many cases of catarrh, thus affording\r\ngreat comfort to those who suffer from this disease.\r\n\r\nThe reader's mind cannot be too strongly impressed with the importance\r\nof combining thorough constitutional with the local treatment of this\r\ndisease. Not only will the cure be thus more surely, speedily, and\r\npermanently, effected, but you thereby guard against other forms of\r\ndisease breaking out, as the result of humors in the blood or\r\nconstitutional derangement or weakness.\r\n\r\nIn curing catarrh and all the various diseases with which it is so\r\nfrequently complicated, as throat, bronchial, and lung diseases, weak\r\nstomach, catarrhal deafness, weak or inflamed eyes, impure blood,\r\nscrofulous and syphilitic taints, the wonderful powers and virtues of\r\nthe \"Golden Medical Discovery\" cannot be too strongly extolled. It has a\r\nspecific effect upon the lining mucous membranes of the nasal and other\r\nair passages, promoting the natural secretion of their follicles and\r\nglands, thereby softening the diseased and thickened membrane, and\r\nrestoring it to its natural, thin, delicate, moist, healthy condition.\r\nAs a blood-purifier, it is unsurpassed. As those diseases which\r\ncomplicate catarrh are diseases of the lining mucous membranes, or of\r\nthe blood, it will readily be seen why this medicine is so well\r\ncalculated to cure them.\r\n\r\nThe \"Golden Medical Discovery\" is the natural \"helpmate\" of Dr. Sage's\r\nCatarrh Remedy. It not only cleanses, purifies, regulates, and builds up\r\nthe system to a healthy standard, and conquers throat, bronchial, and\r\nlung complications, when any such exist, but, from its specific effects\r\nupon the lining membrane of the nasal passages, it aids materially in\r\nrestoring the diseased, thickened, or ulcerated membrane to a healthy\r\ncondition, and thus eradicates the disease. When a cure is effected in\r\nthis manner it is permanent. The system is so purified, regulated, and\r\nstrengthened, as to be strongly fortified against the encroachments of\r\ncatarrh and other diseases. The effects of the \"Golden Medical\r\nDiscovery\" upon the system will be gradual, and the alterative changes\r\nof tissue and function generally somewhat slow. They are with however,\r\nless complete, radical, and lasting; and this constitutes its great\r\nmerit. Under its influence all the secretions are aroused to carry the\r\nblood-poisons out of the system, the nutrition is promoted, and the\r\npatient finds himself gradually improving in flesh; his strength is\r\nbuilt up, his lingering ailments dwindle away, and by and by he finds\r\nhis whole person has been entirely renovated and repaired he feels like\r\na new man--a perfect being.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.\r\nAtomizer. ]\r\n\r\nTHE CLOTHING. With most persons suffering from chronic nasal catarrh,\r\nthere is a great disposition to take cold, even slight cause being\r\nsufficient to produce an acute attack, which greatly aggravates the\r\nchronic affection and operates to render it permanent. To obviate the\r\nbad effects that are liable to result from this predisposition, great\r\nattention should be paid to the clothing, that it thoroughly protects\r\nthe person from sudden changes of temperature. For more particular and\r\npractical suggestions in regard to this matter, the reader is referred\r\nto the article on Clothing, in Part Two, Chapter II, of \"The People's\r\nCommon Sense Medical Adviser.\"\r\n\r\nTHE DIET has an important influence with this disease, as with\r\nconsumption and many other chronic ailments. It should be largely\r\ncomposed of those articles rich in the non-nitrogenized or carbonaceous\r\nelements. Fat meats, rich, sweet cream, good butter, and other similar\r\narticles of food, should comprise a large part of the diet. These\r\nelements, which are prolific in the production of animal heat counteract\r\nthe predisposition to take cold, and thus become most valuable remedial\r\nagents--not less essential than the medical treatment that has been\r\nadvised. The patient, suffering from chronic catarrh, should study well\r\nthe hygienic teachings to be found in Part Two of \"The People's Common\r\nSense Medical Adviser,\" and govern himself accordingly.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF COMPLICATIONS. There are various complications of this\r\ndisease that require modifications of the treatment to meet them\r\nsuccessfully. The rules cannot be made that would enable\r\nnon-professional readers to vary the treatment to suit peculiarities of\r\nconstitution, or complications of the disease. When consulted, either\r\nthe person or by letter, we have been able to so modify the treatment as\r\nto be adopt it to peculiar individuals which rejected the ordinary\r\ntreatment, and have thus cured hundreds who had otherwise failed to find\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.\r\nSteam Atomizer, illustrating position of head during treatment.]\r\n\r\nTIME REQUIRED IN EFFECTING A CURE. Reader, if you suffer from chronic\r\nnasal catarrh, do not expect to be very speedily cured, especially if\r\nyour case is one of long standing. Unprincipled quacks and charlatans,\r\nwho possess no knowledge of disease, or medicine either, and whose sole\r\ndesign is to palm off upon you a bottle or two of some worse than\r\nworthless strong, caustic solution, irritating snuff, or drying\r\n\"fumigator,\" \"dry up,\" \"annihilator,\" \"carbolated catarrh cure,\"\r\n\"catarrh specific,\" or other strong preparation, will tell you that the\r\nworst cases can be _speedily_ cured by these unreasonable means. It is\r\ntrue that such strong, irritating, and drying preparations will many\r\ntimes suddenly arrest the discharge from the nose, but the thickened or\r\nulcerated condition of the lining mucous membrane, which really\r\nconstitutes the disease, is not removed by such treatment, and the\r\ndischarge soon comes on again. Besides, there is danger attending the\r\nemployment of such strong, irritating, or drying preparations. The\r\ndisease, by their use, is frequently driven to the throat, bronchial\r\ntubes, lungs, or brain, and thus a bad matter is made worse. Not less\r\nirrational and unsuccessful is the plan of treating the disease with\r\ninhalations of \"carbolized iodine,\" and other drags, administered\r\nthrough variously-devised pocket and other inhalers. Such treatment may\r\nmask or cover up catarrh for a time; but, by reason of the\r\nconstitutional nature of the disease, it cannot effect a perfect and\r\npermanent cure. Dr. Sage's Catarrh Remedy, on the other hand, cures the\r\ndisease on common-sense, rational, and scientific principles, by its\r\nmild, soothing, and healing properties, to which the disease gradually\r\nyields, when the system has been put in perfect order by the use of\r\n\"Golden Medical Discovery.\" This is the only perfectly safe, scientific,\r\nand successful mode of acting upon and healing it. Without, we trust,\r\nbeing considered egotistical, we can say that this opinion is based upon\r\na large experience and a perfect familiarity with the nature and\r\ncurability of the disease. For many years our whole time and attention\r\nhas been given to the study and cure of catarrh and other chronic\r\ndiseases treated of in \"The People's Common Sense Medical Adviser.\"\r\nCases of catarrh have been treated by thousands, and our medicines for\r\nthe cure of this loathsome disease, and of other chronic diseases, have\r\nmet with an extensive sale in all parts of the United States, and have\r\nfound their way into many foreign countries. The universal satisfaction\r\nwith which their use has been attended, and the grateful manifestations\r\nreceived from the cured, have afforded one of the greatest pleasures of\r\nour lives. Scarcely a mail arrives that does not bring new testimony of\r\ncures effected by the treatment here recommended.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIRECTIONS FOR USING DR. SAGE'S CATARRH REMEDY.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo prepare the medicine ready for use, put the whole quantity of powder\r\ncontained in the package, as put up for sale, into a bottle; pour into\r\nit one pint of cool, soft water. Rain water or melted snow is good.\r\nOrdinary lake, river, well or spring water will do if only _slightly_\r\nhard. Cork the bottle tightly and shake it thoroughly, after which allow\r\nit to stand six or eight hours to settle. Two of the ingredients of\r\nwhich the remedy is composed do not entirely dissolve, but their\r\nmedicinal properties are completely and speedily extracted and taken up\r\nby the water. These settlings have lost their medicinal properties and\r\nshould not be allowed to enter the nasal cavity. It should be kept\r\ntightly corked, not allowing it to freeze in winter, or be kept where it\r\nis very warm in summer. This we term the \"Catarrh Remedy Fluid.\"\r\n\r\nUse the fluid, prepared according to the above directions, not less than\r\nthree or four times a day, the last time just before retiring, in the\r\nfollowing manner: Without shaking the bottle to roll the fluid, pour out\r\na teaspoonful or more into the hollow of the hand, hold it there until\r\nwarmed; first gently, and afterwards forcibly, snuff the fluid up one\r\nnostril and then the other, until the nose is well filled and it passes\r\nback into the throat. No fears need be entertained that it will produce\r\nstrangling or any unpleasant effect in thus using it, for, unlike any\r\nother fluids (simple tepid water not excepted), it does not produce the\r\nslightest pain or disagreeable feeling, but, on the contrary, leaves\r\nsuch a cooling, pleasant sensation that its use soon becomes a pleasure\r\nrather than a task. In a few minutes after thus using the remedy, it\r\nshould be blown out gently (never forcibly), to clear the nose and\r\nthroat of all hardened crusts and offensive accumulations, if any such\r\nexist. Never blow the nose violently, as it irritates the passages and\r\ncounteracts, to some extent, the curative effects of the remedy. This\r\nprocess should be repeated until the remedy has been thoroughly applied\r\ntwo or three times, not blowing it out the last time of using it, but\r\nretaining the medicine in contact with the affected parts for a\r\nconsiderable length of time. No harm can result if the fluid be\r\nswallowed, as it contains nothing poisonous or injurious.\r\n\r\nA BETTER WAY. The manner of using Dr. Sage's Catarrh Remedy, advised\r\nabove, is somewhat imperfect and not nearly so thorough a mode as the\r\none to which the reader's attention will now be directed.\r\n\r\nIn a very large number of bad cases of catarrh, or those of long\r\nstanding, the disease has crept along and extended high up in the nasal\r\npassages, and into the various sinuses or cavities, and tubes\r\ncommunicating therewith. The act of snuffing the fluid _carries it along\r\nthe floor of the nose and into the throat_, but does not carry it _high\r\nenough_, or fill the passages _full enough_, to reach all the chambers,\r\ntubes, and surfaces, that are affected with the disease.\r\n\r\nThe fluid may seem, from the sensation produced, to pass high up between\r\nthe eyes, or even above them, but it does not. It is only a sensation\r\ntransmitted to these parts by nerves, the filaments of which are\r\ndistributed to that portion of the mucous membrane which the fluid does\r\nnot reach, just as a sensation is transmitted to the little finger by a\r\nblow upon the elbow.\r\n\r\nNow, in order to be most successful in the treatment of catarrh, it is\r\nnecessary that _the remedy should reach and be thoroughly applied to all\r\nthe affected parts_. This can be accomplished in only one way, which is\r\nby _hydrostatic pressure_. The anatomy of the nasal passages, and the\r\nvarious chambers and tubes that communicate therewith, is such that they\r\ncannot be reached with fluid administered with any kind of syringe or\r\ninhaling tube, or with any instrument, except one constructed to apply\r\nit upon the principle above stated. Such an instrument is Dr. Pierce's\r\nNasal Douche.\r\n\r\nBy the use of this instrument, the fluid enters every portion of the\r\nair-passages of the head by its own weight, no snuffing being required.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIRECTIONS FOR USING DR. SAGE'S CATARRH REMEDY WITH THIS INSTRUMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.\r\nThis cut illustrates the manner of using Dr. Pierce's Nasal Douche.]\r\n\r\nTo cleanse out the passages previous to applying the Catarrh Remedy\r\nfluid, take one quart of soft water, add to it two large tablespoonfuls\r\nof common salt, and shake it up occasionally until all is dissolved.\r\nBefore use heat it until blood warm, or, in other words, until it gives\r\na pleasant, mild warmth to the inserted finger. Put the reservoir on a\r\nshelf, or hang it up, so that it will be a little higher than the head:\r\nfill the reservoir with salt and water, pressing the tube between the\r\nthumb and finger so as to prevent the fluid from escaping through it;\r\nintroduce the nozzle at the end of the tube into one nostril, pressing\r\nit in far enough to close the entrance of the passage so that no fluid\r\ncan escape by the side of the tube, breathe through the mouth, avoid\r\nswallowing, and allow the fluid to flow. The soft palate, by the act of\r\nbreathing through the mouth, is elevated so as to completely close the\r\npassage into the throat, and thus the fluid is made to flow up one\r\nnostril in a gentle stream, to pass into and thoroughly cleanse all the\r\nsinuses, or cavities, connected with the nasal passages, and to flow out\r\nof the other nostril. The douche should not be employed unless both\r\nnostrils are open and the flow is free. If the head is \"stopped up,\"\r\nsnuff up the warm liquid from the hand occasionally, until the passages\r\nare open and you can breathe freely through both nostrils.\r\n\r\nDo not forget that the instrument will not work properly unless you\r\n_breathe through the mouth and avoid swallowing_ while the fluid flows.\r\n\r\nFill the reservoir a second time with the simple salt and water, and,\r\ninserting the nozzle into the nostril out of which the fluid flowed on\r\nusing it the first time, pass the current through in the opposite\r\ndirection; that is, so that it will flow out of the nostril into which\r\nit flowed the first time of using it.\r\n\r\nAfter having thus thoroughly cleansed the passages, fill the instrument\r\nhalf full or more with the \"Catarrh Remedy Fluid,\" prepared as\r\nheretofore directed, and warmed to a moderate temperature, and pass this\r\nthrough the nose in the same manner as directed for the salt water. The\r\nsalt water is not curative, but is milder than simple water, and is,\r\ntherefore, preferable for cleansing the passages.\r\n\r\nOn first commencing the use of the instrument, it is best to hang it\r\nonly a very little higher than the forehead, but after using it a few\r\ntimes, put it up about as high as the length of the tube will admit.\r\n\r\nLet no one entertain any feeling of timidity on commencing the use of\r\nthis instrument, as its operation is perfectly simple and harmless, and,\r\nwith the fluids which we recommend, is never attended with any\r\nstrangling, choking, pain, or other disagreeable sensations. The\r\nmedicine should be applied with the Douche at least twice a day, in the\r\nmorning and at night on retiring. There is no advantage in using the\r\nmedicine oftener than three times a day, when used with the instrument,\r\nbut a _sufficient_ quantity should be used each time to medicate all the\r\ndiseased parts. If any remains in the Douche it may be poured back into\r\nthe stock solution for subsequent use, but a liquid that has once passed\r\nthrough the nasal cavity contains the germs of the disease and must not\r\nbe used a second time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNASAL POLYPUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe term Nasal Polypus is usually given to a variety of growths which\r\nare met with in the nasal passages far more frequently than any other\r\ntumors. They are thus designated because of their fancied resemblance to\r\nthe aquatic polypus. They occur singly, or in clusters, as illustrated\r\nin Fig. 13. In the early stages the mucous membrane is swollen and\r\nirregularly dilated, presenting a rough and mottled appearance not\r\nunlike chronic catarrh with which they are usually associated. Gradually\r\nthese mound-like tumors enlarge, usually becoming pendulant, and\r\npresenting a grayish opaque glistening surface, similar to the pulp of a\r\ngrape. Occasionally they become massive at the point of attachment, and\r\nassimilate a warty or cauliflower growth. The latter variety is better\r\nsupplied with blood vessels and presents a red or dark pink surface and\r\nmay bleed on slight irritation. The favorite location is beneath or\r\nbehind the middle or superior turbinated bodies, oftentimes nearly or\r\nquite concealed. However, no portion of the mucous membrane lining the\r\nupper air passages is exempt. Sometimes they grow from the roof of the\r\nnostril and pharnyx in pendulous masses, assuming the shape of the\r\ncavities, filling the entire nostril and upper portion of pharnyx. The\r\nmucous membrane covering the turbinated bodies may become dilated and\r\nswollen, finally developing by catarrhal processes into a polypus at\r\nthat point. (See _H_, Fig. 13.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.\r\nNASAL POLYPI.\r\n\r\n_A_. Anterior opening of the nostril.\r\n_B_. Soft Palate, _C_. Orifice of the\r\nEustachian tube. _D, D_.

Nothing definitely is known regarding their causation. They are\r\ngenerally supposed to originate in some constitutional derangement,\r\nimpairing the nutrition of the mucous membranes. Other cases are closely\r\nassociated with chronic nasal catarrh, and frequent attacks of cold in\r\nthe head.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS. These may vary considerably in different cases due to the\r\ncharacter and location of the polypus. In the early stages before the\r\ntumor is well developed, the symptoms may be those of nasal catarrh, and\r\nthe diagnosis of polypus be possible only after a personal examination\r\nby a skillful specialist. Neither is the size of the polypus always in\r\nproportion to the severity of the symptoms. The nasal discharge is\r\ngenerally increased and of a variable character. As the tumors enlarge\r\nthey cause a sense of fullness and weight between and below the eyes,\r\nwith more or less headache and facial neuralgia. There is partial or\r\ncomplete obstruction of one or both nostrils. In some cases the\r\nobstruction changes from one nostril to the other when lying down; the\r\nstoppage generally being on the side toward the pillow. A polypus\r\nlocated at the junction of the nasal passages and throat by force of\r\ngravity always causes obstruction to the lower nasal cavity when lying\r\ndown. Polypi often attain considerable size and by pressure upon and\r\ndisplacement of the surrounding structures occasion hideous facial\r\ndeformity. Changes in the weather often aggravate the symptoms. By\r\nblowing the nostril the tumor sometimes may be forced forward, so that\r\nit may be seen a short distance from the anterior opening of the\r\nnostril. The _voice_ is often affected, being muffled or harsh in tone,\r\nsimilar to that which accompanies a cold in the head. _Respiration_ may\r\nbe considerably embarrassed, due to the obstruction in the nasal\r\npassages, and the patient necessarily resorts to mouth breathing. In\r\nadvanced cases the Larnyx is usually much congested, being constantly\r\nirritated, not only reflexly through the nervous system, but directly by\r\nthe inspired air, and excoriating discharges dropping in the throat from\r\nbehind the palate. Thus it is plain to understand how chronic\r\nPharyngitis, Laryngitis, Bronchitis, and Asthma may result from a small\r\npolypus in the nasal cavity.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. In mild cases correcting the constitutional derangement may\r\ncheck the morbid process in the nostrils and cause absorption of the\r\npolypus growth. For this purpose Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery\r\nis unequaled. The removal of the polypus may sometimes be accomplished\r\nby snuffing powdered blood-root. When these measures fail it is\r\nnecessary to seek surgical assistance. After the removal of the polypus\r\nDr. Sage's Catarrh Remedy should be used to prevent a recurrence.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR OPERATION FOR NASAL TUMORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving operated with unvarying success upon a very large number and\r\nvariety of nasal tumors at the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute we\r\nare positively assured that the means and methods which we employ are\r\nneither severe or dangerous; _no pain_, consequently _no shock_;\r\nrecovery rapid and permanent. Many forms of injection and local\r\ntreatment are in use for the removal of nasal polypi, none of which have\r\nproven to be curative; recurrence of the tumor many times following such\r\ntreatment. Many cases have presented themselves after having been\r\ntreated by the heroic method of seizing the polypus with a pair of\r\nforceps and forcibly tearing it loose, bringing with it segments of\r\nhealthy tissue, leaving bone exposed, and a ragged, uneven surface of\r\ndiseased membrane. It is much easier to properly treat a case from the\r\nbeginning than to undertake it in such a rendition.\r\n\r\nOwing to the fact that these nasal tumors grow directly from the lining\r\nmembranes it is necessary not only to thoroughly remove the tumor but to\r\ntreat the diseased membrane at the point from which the polypus springs;\r\notherwise another tumor may develop at the same point. The nasal passage\r\nhaving been thoroughly anæsthetized, or benumbed, by the use of\r\ncocaine, the nasal speculum is introduced, and by means of reflected\r\nlight from the head mirror worn by the operator, the interior of the\r\nnostril is brought into view. (See Fig. 9, p. 479.)\r\n\r\nOften the attachment of the growth is entirely hidden behind the\r\nirregular bony structures of the nostril so that it requires the skill\r\nof an expert specialist, deft in the manipulation of these parts, to\r\noperate properly.\r\n\r\nMany styles and shapes of delicately devised instruments are necessary\r\nto completely remove the growth without doing injury to the adjacent\r\nstructures. By our newly devised operation the tumor is at once removed,\r\nwithout pain, and with the loss of only a few drops of blood. Further,\r\nbecause the tumor is entirely removed and the base properly treated\r\nthere is not the offensive discharge for a long time afterward and the\r\ndanger from infection and blood-poison to which the patient is subjected\r\nin other forms of treatment.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion we would say that we claim for our operation the following\r\npoints that are worthy of the careful consideration of every one who may\r\nbe so unfortunate as to require the services of a specialist for the\r\nremoval of growths in the nasal or upper air passages.\r\n\r\n1st. Our operation is absolutely painless.\r\n\r\n2d. No chloroform or ether is required.\r\n\r\n3d. We insure perfect removal of growth.\r\n\r\n4th. There is no injury to other adjacent structures.\r\n\r\n5th. The operation is bloodless.\r\n\r\n6th. The recovery is rapid.\r\n\r\n7th. There is no slough to produce pus that may be absorbed and cause\r\nblood-poisoning.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFORMITY OF THE NASAL SEPTUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn health the nasal septum is a bony or cartilaginous plate, as shown in\r\n_A_, Fig. 14, dividing the nasal passages into two cavities of the same\r\nsize and shape. This plate or partition is also a support to which the\r\nflexible structures which form the tip of the nose are attached. In\r\nearly life the septum is flexible and may be bent or doubled by injury\r\nto the nose; but owing to its elasticity usually resumes its natural\r\nposition and shape. After maturity any dislocation or change in this\r\nbony plate usually remains permanent unless some means are employed for\r\nits correction. In a limited number of cases supposed to be chronic\r\nnasal catarrh, we have found upon examination that one or both nasal\r\ncavities were more or less obliterated and obstructed by the deformed\r\nand thickened septum. (See _A_, Fig. 15.) Many of these cases date from\r\nan injury to the external parts, causing only bleeding from the nose and\r\na slight pain for a short time. Chronic inflammation develops at the\r\npoint where the bone is bent or cracked, resulting in thickening, often\r\nproducing nodules or spur-like projections which not only interfere with\r\nnasal breathing, but also act as irritants to the adjacent delicate\r\nmembranes and produce many of the symptoms common to nasal catarrh.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.\r\nAnterior view of the healthy nasal passages as\r\nseen with the projecting portion of\r\nthe nose removed.\r\n\r\n_A._ Vertical septum or bony plate separating\r\nnostrils. _B, B._ Turbinated bodies. _C, C._ Nasal\r\npassages.]\r\n\r\nAmong other common causes are unequal or imperfect development of the\r\nnasal bones, due to an inherited strumous tendency and local ulcerative\r\ndisease, weakening or destroying the bone.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS. The location and extent of the deformity of the nasal septum\r\nnecessarily gives opportunity for a variety of symptoms. In aggravated\r\ncases the nose appears to be bent toward one side. In the earlier stages\r\nthere is an excess of mucous secretion, often dropping into the throat\r\nfrom behind the palate. The discharge is variable as in nasal catarrh\r\nwith more or less difficult nasal breathing, the stoppage changing from\r\none nostril to the other. Sneezing and frequent attacks of nose bleed\r\nare often common symptoms. The tendency of the disease is to extend\r\nbackward often causing headache, deafness, roaring in the ears and\r\npost-nasal disease which results in a chronic sore throat, the latter\r\ndisease often being the one for which the patient seeks advice. If\r\nallowed to progress uninterruptedly the throat gradually becomes more\r\nirritable, associated with an annoying cough, and the voice becomes\r\nharsh and has a nasal tone. The general health is impaired, the nervous\r\nsystem excitable; laryngitis, asthma, and lung disease become\r\ncomplications, which render the existence of the individual miserable.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. In mild cases where the deformity is slight, and the\r\nobstruction is not a constant symptom, the nasal cavities should be\r\ncleansed (See treatment of nasal catarrh) after inhaling dust, and\r\nspecial attention given to the prompt treatment of cold in the head.\r\nShould there be irritability, sneezing, or a constant discharge, it is\r\nadvisable to use Dr. Sage's Catarrh Remedy as directed on p. 483 to\r\nsoothe the excitability and lessen the inflammatory action in and about\r\nthe thickened and deformed septum. As an auxiliary to promote the\r\nabsorption of the thickened tissues and restore them to a healthy\r\nactivity, a number of bottles of the \"Golden Medical Discovery\" should\r\nbe taken while using the local treatment. Any dormant condition of the\r\nliver or digestive tract may be corrected by taking Dr. Pierce's\r\nPleasant Purgative Pellets. In advanced cases after the structures are\r\nso diseased and thickened that it renders local treatment hopeless, only\r\nsurgical interference can prove curative.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR PAINLESS OPERATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the application of a few drops of a solution of cocaine in the\r\nnostril, at the point to be treated, we are now able to produce such\r\nlocal anæsthesia as to render the operation entirely painless without\r\nthe administration of either chloroform or ether. This is an important\r\nconsideration as many are adverse to taking chloroform or ether, and now\r\nthat we possess an agent that produces, locally, complete insensibility\r\nto pain, we are very glad to dispense with their use in all such minor\r\noperations. There is no pain caused even by the application of the\r\ncocaine to deaden the sensibility of the part. Many examinations of the\r\nupper air-passages heretofore very annoying and even painful to the\r\npatient and sometimes unsatisfactory, are rendered entirely painless,\r\nand carried out with a thoroughness that would be impossible without the\r\nuse of this wonderful agent. Not only in surgery of the nose and throat,\r\nbut alike in other departments, our surgeon-specialists employ the same\r\nlocal anæsthetic in all minor operations, none of which are attended\r\nwith the least pain.\r\n\r\nOur specialists were among the first surgeons in this country to employ\r\nthis newly-discovered anæsthetic. We regard it as a great boon to our\r\npatients, and never withhold it in any case where it can be employed to\r\nprevent suffering. Its use is attended with no danger, nor is it\r\nfollowed by bad or disagreeable results.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR OPERATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.\r\nAnterior view of deformed nasal passages as\r\nseem with the projecting portion of the nose removed.\r\n_A._ Deformed and thickened septum or bony\r\nplate separating nostrils. _B,B._ Irregular and\r\nobstructed nasal passages. _C._ Diseased and swollen\r\nturbinated body. _D,D._ Turbinated bodies\r\ncrowded back by septum.]\r\n\r\nThe nostrils being the entrance to and the beginning of the air passages\r\nno dexterity and skill can be spared in treating and properly correcting\r\nany deformity that may exist. Mutilation of these sensitive structures\r\nis sure to be followed by serious reflex symptoms in adjacent parts.\r\n\r\nConsequently cases of this nature should only be entrusted to the care\r\nof a competent and experienced specialist. Our resources and appliances\r\nare unlimited and seldom do we use the surgeon's knife in a case of this\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nAs in the treatment of other pathological growths in the upper air\r\npassages the rhinoscope is indispensable. The parts can only be brought\r\ninto the view of the operator by means of this instrument and sets of\r\nmirrors to reflect light on all sides of the deformed and hidden parts.\r\n\r\nBy our operation both nasal cavities are restored to their normal size\r\nand contour (compare Figs. 14, 15), unhealthy and diseased tissues are\r\nremoved, and free nasal respiration established.\r\n\r\nAll treatments are carried out under strict aseptic precautions, thus\r\nreducing the danger from absorption of poisonous secretions to the\r\nminimum. By our skillful and ingenious management of these cases we\r\nnever have had a single patient manifest any serious symptoms after\r\noperation. In such cases we consider this the only safe, practical, and\r\npermanent cure. Every year hundreds pass out of existence the victims of\r\nincurable disease of the air-passages resulting from morbid nasal\r\nconditions, who might be saved by proper and timely treatment.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHARYNGITIS AND POST-NASAL CATARRH.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.\r\nUse of the Post-nasal Syringe in the treatment\r\nof Post-nasal Catarrh.\r\n\r\n_A_.

Diseased and roughened mucous membrane. _H_. Throat or\r\nPharynx. _I, I_. Interior\r\nof nasal passage.]\r\n\r\nSimple chronic pharyngitis seldom exists alone and uncomplicated; most\r\ncases being the result of previous existing disease of the nasal or\r\npost-nasal passages. Many cases are associated with hypertrophy, or\r\nenlargement, of the tonsils. Usually the disease is located in the upper\r\npart of the pharynx, or throat, behind and above the uvula and soft\r\npalate, and is thus hidden from view when looking into the throat\r\nthrough the mouth. When not associated with nasal catarrh the common\r\nsymptoms are dropping of tenacious mucous in the throat, causing a\r\nconstant desire to hawk and spit; sense of dryness in this region; cough\r\nand expectoration on rising in the morning, which is due to the\r\nirritability of the throat, and may invade the lower air-passages. The\r\nthroat may be studded with red and thickened patches of its mucous\r\nmembrane. Respiration may be embarrassed, the voice affected and the\r\ngeneral health gradually decline. The membrane above and behind the\r\npalate is angry, reddened, thickened and roughened, as represented in\r\n_G_, Fig. 16.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT To rationally treat a disease, attack the cause. Therefore, in\r\nan uncomplicated case of post-nasal disease of the pharynx the medicine\r\nshould be applied at this point. For this purpose we recommend the\r\nregular and continuous use of Dr. Sage's Catarrh Remedy administered\r\npreferably by means of the post-nasal syringe as illustrated in Fig. 16.\r\n\r\nThe efficacy of Dr. Sage's Catarrh Remedy as a curative agent in catarrh\r\nof mucous membranes is unequaled if the medicine be properly and\r\nthoroughly applied. The Catarrh Remedy fluid should be prepared as\r\ndirected in the pamphlet which accompanies the medicine. Warm enough of\r\nthe medicine to fill the syringe twice. After the syringe is filled with\r\nthe warm medicine, introduce the curved tip behind the soft palate,\r\nholding the syringe as seen in Fig. 16, then incline the head forward\r\nover a wash bowl and empty the syringe by pressing the plunger quickly.\r\nThe medicine will immediately come in contact with the diseased surfaces\r\nand pass out through the nostrils, thoroughly medicating, disinfecting\r\nand cleansing the upper part of the throat and the posterior region of\r\nthe nostrils. Two syringes of the medicine should be used for each\r\ntreatment, and two or more applications made every day until a cure is\r\neffected.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the local treatment is being used, Dr. Pierce's Golden\r\nMedical Discovery should be taken to act through the blood upon the\r\ndiseased tissues.\r\n\r\nThe Catarrh Remedy may be administered by means of the Nasal Douche, if\r\nthe case is complicated by nasal catarrh. Should tumors or deformities\r\nexist, it is advisable to consult a specialist.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENLARGED TONSILS.\r\n\r\n\r\nChronic enlargement of the tonsils, as shown in Fig. 17, _A A_, is an\r\nexceedingly common affection. It is most common to those of a scrofulous\r\nhabit. It rarely makes its appearance after the thirtieth year, unless\r\nit has been imperfectly cured. Both tonsils are generally, though\r\nunequally enlarged. A person affected with this disease is extremely\r\nliable to sore throat, and contracts it on the slightest exposure; the\r\ncontraction of a cold, suppression of perspiration, or derangement of\r\nthe digestive apparatus being sufficient to provoke inflammation.\r\n\r\nCAUSES. Repeated attacks of quinsy, scarlet fever, diphtheria, or\r\nscrofula, and general impairment of the system, predispose the\r\nindividual to this disease.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS. The voice is often husky, nasal or guttural, and disagreeable.\r\nWhen the patient sleeps, a low moaning is heard, accompanied with\r\nsnoring and stentorian breathing, and the head is thrown back so as to\r\nbring the mouth on a line with the windpipe, and thus facilitate the\r\ningress of air into the lungs. When the affection becomes serious it\r\ninterferes with breathing and swallowing. The chest is liable to become\r\nflattened in front and arched behind, in consequence of the difficulty\r\nof respiration, thus predisposing the patient to pulmonary disease. On\r\nlooking into the throat, the enlarged tonsils may be seen, as in the\r\nFig. 17. Sometimes they are so greatly increased in size that they touch\r\neach other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.\r\n_A. A._ Enlarged Tonsils. _B_. Elongated\r\nUvula.]\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. The indications to be carried out in the cure of this malady\r\nare:\r\n\r\n(1.) To remedy the constitutional derangement.\r\n\r\n(2.) To remove the enlargement of the tonsilar glands.\r\n\r\nThe successful fulfillment of the first indication may be readily\r\naccomplished by attention to hygiene, diet, clothing, and the use of Dr.\r\nPierce's Golden Medical Discovery, together with small daily doses of\r\nhis \"Pleasant Pellets.\" This treatment should be persevered in for a\r\nconsiderable length of time after the enlargement has disappeared, to\r\nprevent a return.\r\n\r\nTo fulfill the second indication, astringent gargles may be used.\r\nInfusions of witch-hazel or cranesbill should be used during the day.\r\nThe following mixture is unsurpassed: iodine, one drachm; iodide of\r\npotash, four drachms; pure, soft water, two ounces. Apply this\r\npreparation to the enlarged tonsils twice a day, with a probang, or soft\r\nswab, being careful to paint them each time. A persevering use of these\r\nremedies, both internal and local, is necessary to reduce and restore\r\nthe parts to a healthy condition.\r\n\r\nSometimes the enlarged tonsils undergo calcareous degeneration; in this\r\ncase, nothing but their removal by a surgical operation is effectual.\r\nThis can be readily accomplished by any competent surgeon. We have\r\noperated in a large number of cases, and have never met with my\r\nunfavorable results.\r\n\r\nThe method we adopt at the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute for\r\nthe removal of diseased tonsils is, like other minor operations,\r\npainless. The patient is not required to take chloroform or ether. When\r\nthe enlarged gland is once thoroughly removed the disease seldom\r\nreturns.\r\n\r\n\r\nELONGATION OF THE UVULA.\r\n\r\n\r\nChronic enlargement, or elongation of the uvula or soft palate, as shown\r\nat _B_ in Fig. 17, may arise from the same causes as enlargement of the\r\ntonsils. It subjects the individual to a great deal of annoyance by\r\ndropping into or irritating the throat. It causes tickling and frequent\r\ndesire to clear the throat, also change, weakness and loss of voice, and\r\noften gives rise to a very persistent and aggravating cough.\r\nConstriction of the throat, cough and difficult breathing are more\r\nprominent symptoms in complicated cases.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. The treatment already laid down for enlarged tonsils, with\r\nwhich affection, elongation of the uvula is so often associated, is\r\ngenerally effectual. When it has existed for a long time, and does not\r\nyield to this treatment it may be removed by any competent surgeon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONIC LARYNGITIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is of much more frequent occurrence than the acute form, and is\r\noften associated with tubercular affections, and constitutional\r\nsyphilis. It is characterized by an inflammatory condition, ulceration,\r\nor hardening of the mucous membrane of the larynx, most frequently the\r\nlatter. There is also a chronic form, known as _follicular laryngitis_,\r\nor _clergymen's sore throat_, to which public speakers are subject.\r\n\r\nTHE CAUSES of chronic laryngitis are various, as prolonged use of the\r\nvocal organs in reading or speaking; using them too long on one pitch or\r\nkey, without regard to their modulation; improper treatment of acute\r\ndiseases of the throat; neglected nasal catarrh; the inordinate use of\r\nmercury; syphilis; repeated colds which directly cause sore throat,\r\ninjuries, etc. It is also frequently due to tubercular deposits, and in\r\nthese cases it generally terminates in consumption.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS. The affection often comes on insidiously. There is soreness of\r\nthe throat, noticeable particularly when speaking, and immediately\r\nthereafter; a \"raw\" and constricted feeling, leading to frequent\r\nattempts to clear the throat, in order to relieve the uneasy sensation.\r\nThe voice becomes altered, hoarse, and husky, and there is a slight,\r\npeculiar cough, with but little expectoration. At first, the matter\r\nexpectorated is mucus, but as the disease advances, and ulceration\r\nprogresses, it becomes muco-purulent, perhaps lumpy, bloody, or is\r\nalmost wholly pure pus. The voice becomes more and more impaired, and is\r\nfinally lost. In the latter stages, it resembles consumption, being\r\nattended with hectic fever, night-sweats, emaciation, cough, profuse\r\nexpectoration, and sometimes hemorrhage.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. The patient should avoid using his voice as much as possible.\r\nAt the same time, attention should be paid to the diet, the bathing, and\r\nthe clothing. Every thing should be done that is calculated to build up\r\nand improve the general health. Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery is\r\nwell adapted to remove morbid states of the disease, in consequence of\r\nits direct action on the mucous membranes of the air-passages, and its\r\nefficacy in allaying irritation of the laryngeal, pharyngeal, and\r\npneumogastric nerves. It should be perseveringly employed. Iodine\r\ninhalations, administered with the pocket inhaler, illustrated by Fig.\r\n3, and the application of tincture of iodine to the forepart of the\r\nneck, are efficacious in many cases. Inhalations of chloride of ammonia,\r\nadministered with a steam-atomizer, Fig. 11, in the form of spray, are\r\nfrequently of great benefit. _Perseverance_ is necessary, and the\r\nafflicted are cautioned against discontinuing the treatment too soon,\r\nfor the disease is very liable to return.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSUMPTION.\r\n\r\nPHTHISIS PULMONALIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy this we understand a constitutional affection, characterized by a\r\nwasting away of the body, attended by the deposition of tubercular\r\nmatter into the lung tissue. Hence the appellations, _Phthisis\r\nPulmonalis; Pulmonary Tuberculosis; Tubercular Consumption_. Tubercles\r\nmay form in other organs and result in a breaking down of their tissues,\r\nbut the employment of the term _Consumption_ in this article is\r\nrestricted to the lungs. The general prevalence, the insidious attack,\r\nand the distressing fatality of this disease, demand the special\r\nattention and investigation of every thinking person. It preys upon all\r\nclasses of society. Rich and poor alike furnish its victims.\r\n\r\nSome idea of its prevalence may be formed when we consider that, of the\r\nentire population of the globe, one in every three hundred and\r\ntwenty-three persons annually dies of consumption. It may not be\r\ndefinitely known just what proportion of all the deaths in this country\r\nand Europe occurs from this one disease. Those who have gathered\r\nstatistics differ somewhat, some claiming one-fourth, while others put\r\nthe ratio at one-sixth, one-seventh, and even as low as one-ninth. A\r\nfair estimate, and one probably very near the truth, would be one-sixth\r\nor one-seventh of the whole number. In New York City, for five\r\nconsecutive years, the proportion was three in twenty. In New England,\r\nabout twenty thousand annually succumb to this destroyer, and in the\r\nState of New York as many more. These figures may appear to be\r\nexaggerations, but investigations of the subject prove them to be the\r\nsimple truth. Epidemics of cholera, yellow fever, and other diseases of\r\nsimilar character, so terrible in their results, occasion wide-spread\r\nalarm, and receive the most careful considerations for their prevention\r\nand cure, while consumption receives scarcely a thought. Yet the number\r\nof their victims sinks into insignificance when compared with those of\r\nconsumption. Like the thief in the night, it steals upon its victim\r\nunawares. In a large proportion of cases, its approach is so insidious\r\nthat the early symptoms are almost wholly disregarded; indeed, they\r\nexcite but little, if any, attention, and perhaps for a time disappear\r\naltogether. Thus the patient's suspicions, if they have been aroused,\r\nare allayed and appropriate measures for his relief are discontinued.\r\nThis may be the case until renewed attacks firmly establish the disease,\r\nand before the patient is fully aware of the fatal tendency of his\r\nmalady, he is progressing rapidly towards that \"bourne from which no\r\ntraveler returns.\"\r\n\r\nAs has already been stated, consumption is a constitutional disease,\r\nmanifested by feeble vitality, loss of strength, emaciation--symptoms\r\nwhich are too often classed under the name of _general debility_, until\r\nlocal symptoms develop, as _cough, difficult breathing_, or\r\n_hemorrhage_, when examination of the chest reveals the startling fact\r\nthat tubercular deposits have been formed in the lungs. Invalids are\r\nseldom willing to believe that they have consumption, until it is so far\r\nadvanced that all medicine can do is to smooth the pathway to the grave.\r\nAnother characteristic of this disease is _hope_, which remains active\r\nuntil the very last, flattering the patient into expectation of\r\nrecovery. To the influence of this emotion, the prolongation of the\r\npatient's life may often be attributed.\r\n\r\nNATURE OF THE DISEASE. It is an error to suppose that the disease under\r\nconsideration is confined to the lungs. \"Pulmonary Consumption,\" as has\r\nbeen remarked, \"is but a _fragment_ of a great constitutional malady.\"\r\nThe lungs are merely the stage where it plays its most conspicuous part.\r\nEvery part of the system is more or less involved, every vital operation\r\nmore or less deranged; especially is the _nutritive_ function vitiated\r\nand imperfect. The circulation is also involved in the general morbid\r\ncondition. Tubercles, which constitute a marked feature of the disease,\r\nare composed of unorganized matter, deposited from the blood in the\r\ntissue of the lungs. They are small globules of a yellow, opaque,\r\nfriable substance, of about the consistency of cheese. After their\r\ndeposition, they are increased in size by the accretion of fresh matter\r\nof the same kind. They are characteristic of all forms of scrofulous\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nThe most plausible theory in regard to them is, that they are the result\r\nof imperfect nutrition. Such a substance cannot be produced in the blood\r\nwhen this fluid is perfectly formed. It is an unorganized particle of\r\nmatter, resulting from the imperfect elaboration of the products of\r\ndigestion, which is not, therefore, properly fitted for assimilation\r\nwith the tissues. The system being unable to appropriate it, and\r\npowerless to cast in off through the excretory channels, deposits it in\r\nthe lungs or other parts of the body. There it remains as a foreign\r\nsubstance, like a splinter or thorn in the flesh, until ejected by\r\nsuppuration and sloughing of the surrounding parts. It might be supposed\r\nby some that when the offending matter was thus eliminated from the\r\nlungs, they would heal and the patient recover; but, unfortunately, the\r\ndeposition of tubercular matter does no cease. Owing to the morbid\r\naction of the vital forces, it is formed and deposited as fast or\r\nfaster than it can be thrown off by expectoration. Hence arises the\r\nremarkable fatality of pulmonary consumption.\r\n\r\nCAUSES. The causes of consumption are numerous and varied, but may all\r\nbe classed under two heads, viz: _Constitutional_, or _predisposing_,\r\nand _local_, or _exciting_. Of just what tubercular matter consists, is\r\nstill a subject of controversy, but that its existence depends upon\r\ncertain conditions, either _congenital_ or _acquired_, is generally\r\nconceded; and one of these conditions is impaired vitality.\r\nConstitutional predisposition must first give rise to conditions which\r\nwill admit of the formation of tubercular matter, before any cause\r\nwhatever can occasion its local deposition. It must modify the vitality\r\nof the whole system, when other causes may determine in the system thus\r\nimpaired, the peculiar morbid action of which tubercular matter is the\r\nproduct. The general division of causes into predisposing and exciting,\r\nmust ever be more or less arbitrary. Individuals subject to predisposing\r\ncauses may live the natural term of life and finally die of other\r\ndisease. Indeed, when predisposing causes are known to exist, they\r\nshould constitute a warning for the avoidance of other causes. Again,\r\namong the so-called exciting causes, some may operate in such a manner,\r\nwith some individuals, as to predispose them to consumption, and the\r\nresult will be the same as if the disposition had been congenital. The\r\ncauses which in one individual are _exciting_, under other circumstances\r\nand in other individuals, would be _predisposing_, because they act so\r\nas to depress the vitality and impair the nutritive processes.\r\n\r\nTHE PREDISPOSING CAUSES, then, are hereditary predisposition, scrofula,\r\ndebility of the parents, climatic influences, sedentary habits,\r\ndepressing emotions, in fact, _anything_ which impairs the vital forces\r\nand interferes with the perfect elaboration of nutritive material.\r\n\r\nTHE EXCITING CAUSES are those which are capable of arousing the\r\npredisposing ones into activity, and which, in some instances, may\r\nthemselves induce predisposition; as dyspepsia, nasal catarrh, colds,\r\nsuppressed menstruation, bronchitis, retrocession of cutaneous\r\naffections, measles, scarlatina, malaria, whooping-cough, small-pox,\r\ncontinued fevers, pleurisy, pneumonia, long-continued influence of cold,\r\nsudden prolonged exposure to cold, sudden suspension of long-continued\r\ndischarges, masturbation, excessive venery, wastes from excessive mental\r\nactivity, insufficient diet, both as regards quantity and quality,\r\nexposure to impure air, atmospheric vicissitudes, dark dwellings,\r\ndampness, prolonged lactation, depressing mental emotions, insufficient\r\nclothing, improper treatment of other diseases, exhaustive discharges,\r\ntight lacing, fast life in fashionable society, and impurity and\r\nimpoverishment of blood from any cause. This list might be greatly\r\nextended, but the other causes are generally in some manner allied to\r\nthose already named.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS. The symptoms of consumption vary with the progress of the\r\ndisease. Writers generally recognize three stages, which so gradually\r\nchange from one to the other that a dividing line cannot be drawn. As\r\nthe disease progresses, new conditions develop, which are manifested by\r\nnew symptoms. Prior to the advent of pulmonary symptoms, is the latent\r\nperiod, which may extend over a variable length of time, from a few\r\nmonths to several years; and, indeed, may never be developed any\r\nfarther. Until sufficient tubercular matter has been deposited in the\r\nlungs to alter the sounds observed on auscultation and percussion, a\r\ndefinite diagnosis of tubercular consumption cannot be made, even though\r\nthere may have been hemorrhage. Nevertheless, when we find _paleness,\r\nemaciation, accelerated and difficult breathing, increased frequency of\r\nthe pulse, an increase of temperature_, and _general debility_ coming on\r\ngradually without any apparent cause, we have sufficient grounds for\r\ngrave suspicions. These are increased if tenderness under the\r\ncollar-bone, with a slight, hacking cough is present. These symptoms\r\nshould be sufficient to warn any individual who has the slightest reason\r\nto believe that he is disposed to consumption, to lose no time in\r\ninstituting the appropriate hygienic and medical treatment, for it is at\r\nthis stage that remedies will be found most effective. Unfortunately,\r\nthis period is too apt to pass unheeded, or receive but trifling\r\nattention; the patient finds some trivial excuse for his present\r\ncondition, and believes that he will soon be well. But, alas for his\r\nanticipations! The disease goes onward and onward, gradually gaining\r\nground, from which it will be with great difficulty dislodged.\r\n\r\nThe cough now becomes sufficiently harassing to attract attention, and\r\nis generally worse in the morning. The expectoration is slight and\r\nfrothy; the pulse varies from ninety to one hundred and twenty beats in\r\na minute, and sometimes even exceeds this. Flushes of heat and a burning\r\nsensation on the soles of the feet and palms of the hands are\r\nexperienced. A circumscribed redness of one or both cheeks is apparent.\r\nThese symptoms increase in the afternoon, and in the evening are\r\nfollowed by a sense of chilliness more or less severe. The appetite may\r\nbe good, even voracious; but the patient remarks that his food \"does not\r\nseem to do him any good,\" and, to use a popular expression, \"he is going\r\ninto a decline.\" As the strength wanes the cough becomes more and more\r\nsevere, as if occasioned by a fresh cold, in which way the patient\r\nvainly tries to account for it. Expectoration increases, becomes more\r\nopaque, and, perhaps, yellow, with occasionally slight dots or streaks\r\nof blood. The fever increases, and there is more pain and oppression of\r\nthe chest, particularly during deep respiration after exercise.\r\nPalpitation is more severe. There may now be night-sweats, tire patient\r\nwaking in the morning to find himself drenched in perspiration,\r\nexhausted, and haggard. Bleeding from the lungs occurs, and creates\r\nalarm and astonishment, often coming on suddenly without warning. The\r\nhemorrhage usually ceases spontaneously, or on the administration of\r\nproper remedies, and in a few days the patient feels better than he has\r\nfelt for some time previously. The cough is less severe, and the\r\nbreathing less difficult. Indeed, a complete remission sometimes occurs,\r\nand both patient and friends deceive themselves with the belief that the\r\nafflicted one is getting well.\r\n\r\nAfter an indefinite length of time, the symptoms return with greater\r\nseverity. These remissions and aggravations may be repeated several\r\ntimes, each successive remission being less perfect, each recurrence\r\nmore severe, carrying the patient further down the road toward the \"dark\r\nvalley.\" Now the cough increases, the paroxysms become more severe, the\r\nexpectoration more copious and purulent, as the tubercular deposits\r\nsoften and break down. The voice is hollow and reverberating, the chest\r\nis flattened, and loses its mobility; the collar-bones are prominent,\r\nwith marked depression above and below. Auscultation reveals a bubbling,\r\ngurgling sound, as the air passes through the matter in the bronchi,\r\nwith the click, to the air cells beyond. Percussion gives a dull sound\r\nor if there are large cavities, it is hollow, and auscultation elicits\r\nthe amphoric sound, as of blowing into a bottle. Hectic fever is now\r\nfully established; the eye is unusually bright and pearly, with dilated\r\npupils, which gives a peculiar expression; the paroxysms of coughing\r\nexhaust the patient, and he gasps and pants for breath. The tongue now\r\nbecomes furred, the patient thirsty, the bowels constipated, and all the\r\nfunctions are irregularly performed. Another remission may now occur,\r\nand the patient be able to resume light employment, for an indefinite\r\nlength of time, which we have known to extend over three or four years,\r\nwhen the symptoms again return.\r\n\r\nIf the patient is a female, and deranged or suppressed menstruation has\r\nnot marked the accession of pulmonary symptoms, the flow now becomes\r\nprofuse and clotted, or is scanty and colorless, sometimes ceasing\r\naltogether. In the male, the sexual powers diminish, and copulation is\r\nfollowed by excessive and long-continued prostration. From this time\r\nonward, the progress of the disease is more rapid. The liver and kidneys\r\nare implicated. In addition to the pallor, the complexion becomes\r\njaundiced, giving the patient, who is now wasting to a mere skeleton, a\r\nghastly look. The urine is generally copious and limpid, though\r\noccasionally scanty and yellow. The pulse increases to one hundred and\r\nthirty or one hundred and forty beats in the minute, and is feeble and\r\nthread-like. The cough harasses the patient so that he does not sleep,\r\nor his rest is fitful and unrefreshing; whenever sleep does occur, the\r\npatient wakes to find himself drenched with a cold, clammy perspiration.\r\nThe throat, mouth, and tongue now become tender, and occasionally\r\nulcerate. Expectoration is profuse, purulent, and viscid, clinging\r\ntenaciously to the throat and mouth, and the patient no longer has\r\nstrength to eject it. The hair now falls off, the nails become livid,\r\nand the breathing difficult and gasping; the patient has no longer\r\nstrength to move himself in bed and has to be propped up with pillows,\r\nand suffocates on assuming the recumbent position. Drinks are swallowed\r\nwith difficulty. Diarrhea takes the place of constipation. The\r\nextremities are cold, swollen, and dropsical; the voice feeble, hollow,\r\ngrating, husky, the patient gasping between each word; the respiration\r\nis short and quick. A slight remission of these symptoms occurs. The\r\npatient is more comfortable, lively, cheerful, and perhaps forms plans\r\nfor the future. But it is the last effort of expiring vitality, the last\r\nflicker of the lamp of life, the candle burns brilliantly for a moment,\r\nand with one last effort goes out, and death closes the scene.\r\n\r\nThe duration of the active stage of consumption varies from a few weeks\r\nto several years, the average time being about eighteen months.\r\n\r\n_Cough_ is always a prominent symptom throughout the entire course of\r\nthe disease, varying with its progress.\r\n\r\n_Expectoration_, at first scanty, then slightly increased, colorless,\r\nfrothy, and mucous, is also a characteristic. After a time it becomes\r\nopaque, yellow, and more or less watery; then muco-purulent and finally\r\npurulent, copious, and viscid. When tubercular matter is freely\r\nexpectorated, with but little mucus, it sinks in water. This symptom\r\ncontinues to the very last.\r\n\r\n_Haemoptysis_ (bleeding from the lungs) may occur at any stage of the\r\ndisease, often being the first pulmonary symptom noticed, again being\r\ndelayed until late; and there are cases in which it does not happen at\r\nall. It seldom occurs in any other disease.\r\n\r\n_Night-sweats_ may occur at any stage, though they are rarely\r\nexperienced until the disease is pretty well established, and are very\r\nexhausting.\r\n\r\n_Hectic Fever_ generally occurs soon after the pulmonary symptoms are\r\ndeveloped, and increases in intensity with the progress of the disease.\r\nThere are usually two paroxysms in twenty-four hours, one of which\r\noccurs towards evening and is followed by night-sweats.\r\n\r\n_Dyspnoea_ (difficult breathing) is at first slight, except after\r\nexertion, amounting to only a sense of oppression; but it becomes more\r\nand more severe as the disease advances, until the very last, when it is\r\nagonizing in the extreme.\r\n\r\n_Aphthæ_, sometimes extending to the pharynx and larynx, generally\r\noccurs towards the last. The mouth and throat become so very sore and\r\ntender that nourishment and medicine are taken with difficulty.\r\n\r\n_Emaciation and Debility_ are characteristic of the disease. They\r\nfluctuate as the disease advances or is retarded, increasing to the very\r\nlast.\r\n\r\n_Auscultation and Percussion_ constitute valuable means of diagnosis\r\nfrom the time tubercular matter begins to be deposited to the very last,\r\nand, when correctly practiced, reveal the extent and progress of the\r\ndisease. As a knowledge of the sounds elicited can only be acquired by\r\npractical experience with proper instruments, they will not be described\r\nhere. The only diseases with which consumption is likely to be\r\nconfounded are general debility in the early stage, bronchitis, chronic\r\npleurisy, chronic pneumonia, and abscess in the lungs, after the advent\r\nof pulmonary symptoms.\r\n\r\nCURABILITY. Notwithstanding the prevailing opinion that consumption is\r\nincurable, there exists ample, incontrovertible evidence to the\r\ncontrary. Its curability is established beyond the shadow of a doubt.\r\nIndividuals have recovered in whom there was extensive destruction of\r\npulmonary tissue, and, indeed, entire destruction of one lung. Numerous\r\ninstances are on record in which persons have suffered from all the\r\nsymptoms of confirmed consumption, and have regained their health and\r\nsubsequently died of other diseases. The case of the late Dr. Joseph\r\nParish, of Philadelphia, affords a striking example of this kind. In\r\nearly life, he manifested all the symptoms of confirmed consumption,\r\nincluding frequent hemorrhages, yet he fully regained his health, and,\r\nafter a very useful life, died at an advanced age of another disease.\r\nPost-mortem examination revealed the existence of cicatrices, or scars,\r\nin his lungs where tubercular matter had been deposited. Dr. Wood, in\r\nhis Practice of Medicine, mentions another instance of a medical\r\ngentleman in Philadelphia, who in early life suffered from consumption\r\nwith hæmoptysis, from which he recovered, and afterwards died, at an\r\nadvanced age, of typhoid fever, when the knife revealed the presence of\r\ncicatrices. Post-mortem examinations of individuals who have died of\r\nother diseases, have revealed, in numerous instances, the presence of\r\nconsumption at some period of their existence. In these cases the lungs\r\nwere perfectly healed by cicatrization, or by the deposit of a chalky\r\nmaterial. A French physician made post-mortem examinations of one\r\nhundred women, all of whom were over sixty years of age, and who had\r\ndied of other diseases, and in fifty of them he found evidences of the\r\nprevious existence of consumption.\r\n\r\nProfessor Flint says that consumption sometimes terminates in recovery,\r\nand that his observations lead him to the conclusion that the prospect\r\nof recovery is more favorable in cases characterized by frequent\r\nhemorrhages. Drs. Ware and Walshe are also led to the same conclusion.\r\n\r\nProfessor J. Hughes Bennett, of Edinburgh, has thoroughly investigated\r\nthe subject, and adds his testimony to that of others, citing numerous\r\ncases that have resulted in perfect recovery. If such testimony is not\r\nsufficient, we may mention the following, whose names are well known and\r\nrespected in professional circles, and all of whom declare that\r\nconsumption is a curable disease. The list includes Laennec, Andral,\r\nCruveilhier, Kingston, Presat, Rogée, Boudet, and a host of others.\r\n\r\nNo farther back than 1866, on page 145, of the proceedings of the\r\nConnecticut Medical Society, we find \"Observations, Ante-mortem and\r\nPost-mortem, upon the case of the late President Day by Prof. S.G.\r\nHubbard, M.D., New Haven,\" from which we learn that Jeremiah Day, LL.\r\nD., who was for twenty-nine years President of Yale College, was, while\r\na mere youth, a victim of pulmonary consumption. During his infancy and\r\nboyhood his vitality was feeble. He entered Yale College as a student in\r\n1789, \"but was soon obliged to leave the institution on account of\r\npulmonary difficulty, which was doubtless the incipient stage of the\r\norganic disease of the lungs which subsequently developed itself.\" He\r\nremained in feeble health for two years, but returned to college, and\r\ngraduated in 1797. For the next six years his lung difficulties were\r\nquite severe, and he repeatedly bled in large quantities, but he had so\r\nfar recovered in 1803, as to accept a Professorship. He was afterwards\r\nchosen President of the college, which office he held for many years, in\r\nthe enjoyment of good health. He died from \"old age,\" as we are told, in\r\n1867, aged 94 years.\r\n\r\nStatistics show that under the improved methods of treating this\r\ndisease, the mortality, as compared with previous years, has been\r\ngreatly reduced. Clinical observation proves that injuries to the lungs\r\nare not so fatal as was once supposed.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. The earlier the treatment of this disease is undertaken, the\r\ngreater is the probability of success. The reason of this is obvious; at\r\nfirst the disease is general or constitutional, but as it advances, by\r\nthe deposit of _tubercular matter_, it becomes both constitutional and\r\nlocal. Hence the treatment must be both _general_ and _local_. The\r\noccurrence of certain prominent and distressing symptoms, either from\r\nthe natural progress of the disease, or from complications with other\r\naffections, often renders it difficult, even for physicians, to\r\ndetermine how far their treatment should be general and how far local.\r\n\r\nTreating the symptoms instead of the general disease, or treating the\r\nconstitutional disease without regard to the symptoms which arise from\r\nit, is an error into which many physicians have fallen. The\r\nconstitutional affection, the local manifestations and complications,\r\nand the circumstances and individual peculiarities of the patient, must\r\nall be carefully considered; bearing in mind all the while, that\r\ntubercular matter is the product of a morbid action, which, in every\r\ncase, must exist before its deposition in the lungs, or any other\r\ntissue, can take place.\r\n\r\nIn every case in which curative treatment is to be instituted, the\r\nhearty and persistent co-operation of both patient and friends is\r\nabsolutely necessary; and the treatment, which is both hygienic and\r\nmedical in character, should have in view the following aims:\r\n\r\n(1.) The avoidance of the causes concerned in the production and\r\nperpetuation of the disease.\r\n\r\n(2.) The restoration of healthy nutrition, in order to stop the\r\nformation of tuberculous matter.\r\n\r\n(3.) The arrest of the abnormal breaking down of the tissues, and the\r\nprevention of emaciation.\r\n\r\n(4.) The relief of local symptoms, and the complications arising from\r\nother diseases.\r\n\r\nThe fulfillment of the first indication, the avoidance of causes, is of\r\nthe utmost importance, for if they have been sufficient to _produce_ the\r\ndisease, their continued operation must certainly be sufficient to\r\n_perpetuate_ it. A single individual is very often subjected to the\r\noperation of several of the causes already enumerated, some of which, in\r\nconsequence of circumstances and surroundings, are unavoidable. Of\r\nthese, the one most difficult to overcome is climate; _i.e._ the\r\nfrequent variations of temperature.\r\n\r\nUpon the subject of climate much has been written. But that which is\r\nbest adapted to the cure of consumption, is that which will enable the\r\npatient to pass a certain number of hours every day in the pure open\r\nair, without exposure to sudden alterations of temperature. There are\r\nvery few persons who change their place of residence, except as a last\r\nresort, when the disease is in the last stage. It is then productive of\r\nlittle or no good. This is one reason why so many people having\r\nconsumption die in Florida, and other warm countries. If a change of\r\nclimate is to be effected at all, it should be made early.\r\n\r\nThe most powerful stimulant to health is well-regulated exercise. It\r\nassists the performance of every function, and is of paramount\r\nimportance to promote good digestion and proper assimilation, conditions\r\nessential for recovery. It should not, however, be carried beyond the\r\npowers of endurance of the individual, so as to exhaust or fatigue.\r\nEverything that can invigorate should be adopted; everything that\r\nexhausts should be shunned.\r\n\r\nTo fulfill the second indication, to restore healthy nutrition, requires\r\nnot only a proper diet, both as regards quantity and quality, but\r\ndemands that the integrity of the organs concerned in the process of\r\ndigestion and assimilation, shall be maintained at the highest standard\r\nof perfection possible.\r\n\r\nThat the diet be sufficient in quantity should be obvious to all. It is\r\nalso necessary that it be nutritious, and that it should contain\r\ncarbonaceous elements. Food of a starchy or saccharine character is apt\r\nto increase acidity, and interfere with the assimilation of other\r\nelements, therefore, articles, rich in fatty matters, should enter\r\nlargely into the diet. The articles of food best adapted to the\r\nconsumptive invalid are milk, rich cream, eggs, bread made from unbolted\r\nwheat-flour, and raised with yeast, cracked wheat, oatmeal, good butter,\r\nbeef, game, and fowls. These contain the necessary elements for\r\nassimilation. Oily food is of great importance, and the beef eaten\r\nshould contain a good proportion of fat. Plenty of salt should always be\r\neaten with the food, and a desire for it is often experienced.\r\nOver-eating should be avoided, lest the stomach be induced to rebel\r\nagainst articles of diet rich in important elements.\r\n\r\nDerangement of the process of nutrition requires careful attention, and,\r\nif necessary, correction. For this purpose, nothing can excel Dr.\r\nPierce's Golden Medical Discovery. It increases the appetite, favors the\r\nnutritive transformation of the food, enriches the blood, and thus\r\nretards the deposition of tubercular matter. It is so combined that,\r\nwhile it meets all these indications, it relieves or prevents the\r\ndevelopment of those distressing symptoms so common in this disease.\r\n\r\nThe \"Golden Medical Discovery\" is adapted to fulfill the third\r\nindication in the management of this disease, which is to check the\r\nabnormal breaking down and waste of tissues, which constitute such a\r\nprominent feature in this malady. The antiseptic properties of the\r\n\"Discovery\" are unmistakably manifested in preventing such abnormal\r\ndecomposition. The emaciation, excessive expectoration, profuse\r\nperspiration, diarrhea, and hectic fever, common to consumption, are all\r\ndue to a too rapid disintegration and waste of the tissues. It is in\r\nthis condition of the system that this medicine, by its powerful\r\nantiseptic properties, manifests its most wonderful curative ability.\r\nWhen, as in this disease, the vital forces of the system have, in a\r\ndegree, lost their restraining influence over the processes of\r\ndisintegration, waste, and decay, which goes on so rapidly that\r\nnutrition cannot compensate for the loss to the system, then it is that\r\nthe \"Golden Medical Discovery,\" by its antiseptic influence, checks this\r\nrapid waste of the tissues, and thus arrests the disease. To the lack of\r\nemployment of such a remedy in the treatment of consumption, the\r\nunparalleled fatality of the disease is largely due. In their anxiety to\r\nimprove digestion and nutrition, and thus build up the tissues,\r\nphysicians often lose sight of the no less important indication of\r\nrestraining the destructive waste going on in the system, which\r\noverbalances the supplies furnished by absorption. The gradually\r\nincreasing emaciation and loss of strength render perpetuity of the\r\norganism impossible.\r\n\r\nThe fulfillment of the fourth indication, to relieve local symptoms, and\r\nthe complications with other diseases, is often attended with no little\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\n_The Cough_ is a secondary symptom, arising from the irritation caused\r\nby the tubercular deposits. Medicated inhalations may give temporary\r\nrelief, but cannot cure it. They strike at the branches of the disease,\r\nwhile the root is left to flourish and develop new branches.\r\n\r\nExpectorants have been employed to a great extent, and the theories,\r\nwhich have been advanced in favor of their use, are sometimes very\r\ningenious. That they modify the cough, we do not attempt to deny; but it\r\nis usually at a great expense, for they derange the stomach and\r\ninterfere with digestion and assimilation.\r\n\r\nImprovement of the general health is always attended with amelioration\r\nof the cough. If the patient did not cough at all, the lungs would soon\r\nfill up with broken-down tissue, and death from suffocation would\r\nresult. Irritation of the nerves supplying the lungs sometimes occurs,\r\nand causes the patient to cough immoderately, when it is not necessary\r\nfor the purpose of expectoration. This condition is readily controlled\r\nby Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery, which exerts a decidedly\r\nquieting and tonic influence upon the pneumogastric nerve, which, with\r\nits ramifications, is the one involved. An infusion of the common red\r\nclover, in tablespoonful doses, will also be found a valuable adjunct in\r\novercoming this condition.\r\n\r\n_Hoemoptysis_. Hemorrhage from the lungs is generally sudden and\r\nunexpected in its attack, though sometimes preceded by difficulty of\r\nbreathing, and a salty taste in the mouth. Although it _very rarely_\r\ndestroys life, it often occasions alarm. Common table salt, given in\r\none-fourth to one-half teaspoonful doses, repeated every ten or fifteen\r\nminutes, is generally sufficient to control it. Ligatures applied to the\r\nthighs and arms, sufficiently tight to arrest the circulation of blood\r\nin the veins, but not tight enough to impede it in the arteries, is a\r\nuseful proceeding. Ergot, in teaspoonful doses of the fluid extract,\r\nhamamelis, and gallic acid, all are valuable for this purpose.\r\n\r\n_Night-sweats_ can only be regarded as a symptom of weakness, and are to\r\nbe remedied by an improvement of the general health. Bathing in salt\r\nwater is sometimes attended with good results. The practice of giving\r\nacids for this symptom can only be regarded as irrational. It may arrest\r\nthe sweating, but it will do harm in other ways. Belladonna, given at\r\nbed-time, is an effectual remedy.\r\n\r\n_Frequency of the pulse_ is generally a prominent symptom in this\r\ndisease. It sometimes points to a condition of sufficient importance to\r\nrequire a remedy. Although the \"Golden Medical Discovery\" is combined to\r\nmeet this condition, its value may be greatly enhanced by adding\r\none-half to one teaspoonful, according to the urgency of the case and\r\nthe frequency of the pulse, of the fluid extract of _Veratrum Viride_ to\r\neach bottle. The benefit of this, when persisted in, will be apparent in\r\nthe amelioration of all the symptoms, and in the general improvement.\r\nThis fluid extract can be had at any drug store.\r\n\r\n_Diarrhea_ is sometimes a troublesome symptom, and particularly so in\r\nthe latter stages of the disease. It is generally due to acidity of the\r\nalimentary canal, to which the treatment must be directed. Great care\r\nshould be taken in the selection of the diet to improve the quality and\r\navoid everything which disagrees with the patient. Improve digestion by\r\nevery possible means. Carbonate of soda and rhubarb, in the form of a\r\nsyrup, are sometimes excellent. The Compound Extract of Smart-weed, in\r\nsmall doses, will generally diminish the frequency of the discharges.\r\n\r\n_Derangement of the Liver_ is often a complication requiring attention,\r\nand the timely relief of which goes very far in ameliorating the general\r\ncondition of the patient. The \"Golden Medical Discovery\" is generally\r\nsufficient to relieve this complication. Its influence, however, may be\r\nconsiderably increased in this direction by the use of Dr. Pierce's\r\nPleasant Pellets, according to the directions which accompany them. They\r\nshould only be taken in the smallest doses, one or two \"Pellets \"every\r\nday, just enough to produce a natural movement of the bowels each day.\r\n\r\n_Uterine Derangements_. In the female, derangement of the menstrual\r\nfunction is generally an early complication of consumption, if indeed it\r\ndoes not occur at the outset. It deserves early attention, and, in\r\naddition to the remedies already advised, Dr. Pierce's Favorite\r\nPrescription is so compounded as to meet the requirements of this\r\ncondition, and at the same time exert a favorable influence upon the\r\nconstitutional disease.\r\n\r\nThe numerous reports of cures of well-developed cases of Consumption to\r\nbe found in the back portion of this little treatise must be sufficient,\r\nit seems to us, to convince the most skeptical of the wonderful power\r\nwhich Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery exercises over this terribly\r\nfatal malady. As will be noted, many of the cases there reported had\r\nlong been unsuccessfully treated with cod liver oil emulsion and all the\r\nother usual remedies employed by the profession and were fast running\r\ndown. \"Golden Medical Discovery\" aroused the stomach and liver, and\r\nstarted all the nutritive functions into action, whereby digestion and\r\nnutrition were promoted and both the strength and flesh steadily built\r\nup. The reader will bear in mind, that most of the cases hereinafter\r\nreported, were pronounced Consumption by their attending physicians as\r\nwell as by us. It cannot be said, therefore, that we exaggerate the\r\nmalady and that the cases were merely bad, lingering coughs. Thousands,\r\nwhose maladies have been pronounced genuine Tubercular Pulmonary\r\nConsumption, (Phthisis Pulmonalis) by eminent physicians have been\r\n_perfectly_ and _permanently_ cured by the use of Dr. Pierce's Golden\r\nMedical Discovery. It can, therefore, no longer be doubted that this\r\nwonderful compound is far superior as a remedy for Consumption to cod\r\nliver oil, compound Hypophosphites, and the many other agents so highly\r\nextolled, and so generally prescribed for this fatal malady by even the\r\nmore progressive and advanced of the medical profession of our day. Read\r\nthe letters received from grateful patients who have been cured and note\r\nhow many commend the use of \"Golden Medical Discovery,\" as a \"last\r\nresort,\" after their home physicians had exhausted all their skill and\r\nresources in vain.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONIC BRONCHITIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a subacute or chronic form of inflammation of the mucous\r\nmembrane of the bronchial tubes, of a very persistent character and\r\nvariable intensity. There are few diseases which manifest a greater\r\nvariety of modifications than this.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS. The symptoms of this disease vary greatly with its violence\r\nand progress. Cough is always present, and is very often the first\r\nsymptom to attract the patient's attention. It is usually increased by\r\nevery slight cold, and with each fresh accession becomes more and more\r\nsevere, and is arrested with greater difficulty. The cough is always\r\npersistent, sometimes short and hacking, at other times deep, prolonged,\r\nand harsh. Sometimes it is spasmodic and irritating and particularly so\r\nwhen it is associated with affections of the larynx, or with asthma,\r\ninvolving irritation of the branches or the filaments of the\r\npneumogastric nerve.\r\n\r\nWhen the chronic follows the acute form of the disease, or follows\r\ninflammation of the lungs, the expectoration may be profuse from the\r\nfirst, and of a yellowish color and tenacious character. When the\r\ndisease arises from other causes, the expectoration is generally slight\r\nat first, and the cough dry or hacking. This may continue some time\r\nbefore much expectoration occurs. The expectorated matter is at first\r\nwhitish, opaque, and tenacious, mixed sometimes with a frothy mucus,\r\nrequiring considerable coughing to loosen it and throw it off. As the\r\ndisease progresses, it becomes thicker, more sticky, of a yellowish or\r\ngreenish color, mixed with pus, and sometimes streaked with blood. In\r\nthe latter stages, it becomes profuse and fetid, and severe hemorrhage\r\nmay occur. Sometimes the cough and expectoration disappear when the\r\nweather becomes warm, to appear again with the return of winter, which\r\nhas gained for it the appellation of _winter cough_. The sufferers feel\r\nas if something was bound tightly round them, rendering inhalation\r\ndifficult. Soreness throughout the chest is often a persistent symptom,\r\nespecially when the cough is dry and hard. Behind the breast-bone there\r\nis experienced a sense of uneasiness, in some cases amounting to pain,\r\nmore or less severe.\r\n\r\nAs the disease progresses, the loss of strength is more and more marked,\r\nthe patient can no longer follow his usual employment, his spirits are\r\ndepressed, and he gradually sinks, or tubercular matter is deposited in\r\nthe lungs, and consumption is developed.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. Thorough attention to hygiene, with the avoidance of the\r\ncauses concerned in the production and perpetuation of the disease, is\r\nnecessary. The patient must be protected from the vicissitudes of the\r\nweather by plenty of clothing; flannel should be worn next to the skin,\r\nwith a pad of flannel or buckskin over the chest, and the feet should be\r\nkept warm and dry. Exercise in the open air is essential. When the\r\nweather is so cold as to excite coughing, something should be worn over\r\nthe mouth, as a thin cloth, handkerchief, muffler, or anything which\r\nwill modify the temperature of the atmosphere before it comes into\r\ncontact with the mucous lining of the lungs. Good ventilation of\r\nsleeping-rooms is all-important; not that the air should be cold, but\r\nthat it should be as pure as possible.\r\n\r\nThe diet must be nutritious, cabonaceous, and of sufficient quantity.\r\nBeef, milk, rich cream, plenty of good butter, eggs, fish, wheat bread\r\nfrom unbolted flour, supply the appropriate alimentary substances for\r\nperfect nutrition and the maintenance of animal heat.\r\n\r\nTo overcome the modified form of inflammation in the bronchial tubes,\r\nall sources of irritation should be avoided, as the inhalation of dust,\r\nor excessively cold air. It is in the cure of severe and obstinate cases\r\nof this disease that Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery has achieved\r\nunparalleled success, and won the highest praise from those who have\r\nused it. Its value will generally be enhanced in treating this complaint\r\nby adding one-half a teaspoonful of the fluid extract of _Veratrum\r\nViride_ to each bottle. This can be added by any respectable druggist.\r\nEspecially should it be thus modified if the pulse be accelerated so as\r\nto beat ninety or a hundred times in a minute. The \"Golden Medical\r\nDiscovery\" should be taken in teaspoonful doses, repeated every two\r\nhours. When the cough is dry and hard, with no expectoration, it arises\r\nfrom irritation of some of the branches of the pneumogastric nerve,\r\nwhich this remedy will relieve. It may, however, be aided by inhaling\r\nthe hot vapor of vinegar and water, or vapor from a decoction of hops,\r\nto which vinegar has been added.\r\n\r\nThe use of Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery should be _persisted_\r\nin, taking it in frequent doses, every two or three hours, and keeping\r\nup its use until the disease yields and is perfectly stamped out. Do not\r\nexpect a formidable disease of perhaps weeks' or months' duration to be\r\n_speedily_ cured. Chronic diseases are generally slow in their inception\r\nand development and can only be cured by gradual stages. Perseverance in\r\ntreatment is required. Many invalids do not possess the strength of\r\npurpose--the will power--to continue the use of the \"Golden Medical\r\nDiscovery\" long enough to receive its full benefits. It is worse than\r\nuseless for such to commence its use, for without persistency it cannot\r\nbe expected to cure such obstinate maladies as chronic bronchitis.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nASTHMA.\r\n\r\nPHTHISIC.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most distressing ailments with which the human family is\r\nafflicted is asthma. Its symptoms are not to be mistaken. Suddenly and\r\nwithout apparent provocation the patient experiences the greatest\r\ndifficulty in breathing. When warning is given, there is usually a sense\r\nof fullness in the stomach, flatulence, languor, and general nervous\r\nirritability. The countenance is a picture of anxiety and horror. The\r\ndifficulty of breathing increases and the struggle for air commences.\r\nWindows and doors are thrown open, fans used, and, utterly regardless of\r\nconsequences, the sufferer passes the whole night in exposure and\r\ntorture, even though the temperature be below zero. Fearing suffocation,\r\nthe patient dare not lie down; he rushes to the window for air, rests\r\nhis head upon a table or chair, or upon his hands, with the elbows upon\r\nthe knees, jumps up suddenly and gasps and struggles for air. The eyes\r\nare prominent and the veins of the forehead distended with blood;\r\nsometimes the bowels are relaxed. The urine is colorless and is passed\r\nin copious quantities. This symptom indicates great excitement of the\r\nnervous system. The voice is hoarse, articulation difficult, breathing\r\nlimited, noisy and wheezy. The _wheezing_ is pathognomonic of the\r\ndisease. It can only be confounded with croup, and then only in the\r\nyoung. In croup there is pain and difficulty in swallowing, fever and\r\ncough, which are usually absent in asthma. A severe paroxysm of asthma\r\nis very distressing to witness, and one unused to it might well suppose\r\nthe sufferer to be in his last agonies. No definite limit can be\r\nassigned to the duration of the attack or of the disease. It may last\r\nbut a few minutes, may endure for hours, or with slight remission\r\ncontinue for days. The condition of the patient may be for years as\r\nchangeable as the pointings of the weather-vane. In fact, the atmosphere\r\nhas much to do with the disease. With every approaching storm, with\r\nevery cloud of dust, even the dust from sweeping a room, with every foul\r\nodor, and, in some more sensitive organizations, with even the perfume\r\nof flowers, a paroxysm is provoked. Truly he is a \"child of\r\ncircumstances,\" a veritable football upon the toes of every atmospheric\r\ndisturbance.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNPARALLELED SUCCESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPersons affected with asthma or phthisic are numerous. With such an\r\namount of suffering in our midst is it not a marvel, if not a disgrace,\r\nthat the medical profession of to-day endorse the opinions of a half\r\ncentury ago and pronounce it incurable, rather than make stupendous and\r\nlaudable efforts to discover plans of medication that will result in\r\ncertain and permanent cure? Almost single handed we undertook this field\r\nof investigation, and we take pleasure in reporting that our labors have\r\nbeen crowned with success. The large experience furnished us has led to\r\nthe discovery of remedies for this distressing malady of more than\r\nordinary efficacy. Through the agency of these means we have been\r\nenabled to cure hundreds, who had suffered untold tortures for twelve,\r\nfifteen, or twenty-five years. Some whom we have been successful in\r\ncuring had suffered from childhood to middle and even old age. The\r\ntreatment of asthma, or phthisic, still continues to be a prominent\r\nspecialty at the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURE OF THE DISEASE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs to the exact pathological condition in this malady, opinions differ.\r\nSome physicians consider it a disease of the nervous system, others, of\r\nthe blood, others, of the bronchial tubes, while not a few believe it to\r\nbe dependent upon some disease of the stomach, heart, liver, kidneys, or\r\ndue to urinary affections, or \"female weakness.\" Respecting all these\r\ndiseases of special organs, it is evident that any complication, and\r\nparticularly one that is debilitating or causes irritation of the\r\nnervous system will increase its severity. This important fact we keep\r\nconstantly in view in our treatment, and prescribe remedies to remove\r\nall complications.\r\n\r\nIn heart disease there is often dyspnoea, or difficult breathing, but\r\nthis is not of the nature of asthma, or phthisic. The condition of the\r\nlungs is readily understood. There being an obstruction to the free\r\npassage of the blood through the heart, any excessive muscular exertion,\r\nor anything, in fact, which increases the action of the heart, is very\r\napt to produce congestion of the lungs, and then the blood becomes\r\nsurcharged with carbonic acid, which causes increased efforts to take\r\nmore air into the lungs.\r\n\r\nA NERVOUS DISEASE. A sudden fright, unfavorable news, grief, loss of\r\nproperty, etc., circumstances which affect the mind and nervous system,\r\nalmost invariably throw the phthisical into a paroxysm. Nervines are\r\ndemanded, particularly if the case be a chronic one, and we see that\r\nthey are carefully and properly prepared and supplied, and in such a\r\nform as to be exactly fitted to the temperament and constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOPULAR REMEDIES USED FOR SELF-TREATMENT OF ASTHMA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are numerous remedies that may be used to _relieve paroxysms_ of\r\nasthma. Among them we will notice a few that are most frequently\r\nemployed by the profession. They can be easily and inexpensively\r\nprepared by any patient or druggist:\r\n\r\n1. Equal parts of the tinctures of lobalis capsicum and skunk cabbage\r\nroot. _Dose_.--Take a half teaspoonful in a little water every ten or\r\nfifteen minutes until relieved.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--This is an antispasmodic and relaxant. In considerable quantities\r\nit will produce sickness at the stomach and perhaps vomiting. It should\r\nnot be used when there is disease of the heart.\r\n\r\n2. Chloroform. _Dose_.--A small quantity (say thirty drops), may be\r\npoured upon a handkerchief or napkin, held about one inch from the\r\nnostrils and the vapor inhaled. It is quite unnecessary to use this\r\nuntil insensibility follows; in fact, such an effect would be hazardous\r\nto life in the hands of the inexperienced.\r\n\r\n3. Sulphuric ether. _Dose_.--The same as No. 2, and with the same\r\nprecaution. Either of them should be used promptly upon the beginning of\r\nthe paroxysm.\r\n\r\n4. Take four ounces of stramonium leaves and strip from the stems,\r\nrubbing between the hands to partly pulverize. To this add one ounce of\r\nsaltpetre, finely powdered. _Dose_.--Place a half teaspoonful upon a\r\nvery hot shovel. Inhale the rising smoke. If the first few inspirations\r\ncause coughing, the smoke should not be evaded as the coughing incites\r\ndeeper inspiration.\r\n\r\n5. Stramonium and saltpetre as in No. 4. Dampen with water and make into\r\nballs or cones. These are more easily handled and are fired in the same\r\nway as the powder and used in the same way.\r\n\r\n6. Take of sunflower leaves, stramonium leaves, mullein leaves, one\r\nounce each; of lobelia leaves, half an ounce; of powdered nitre, one\r\nounce; and benzoic acid, two drams. Mix thoroughly. _Dose_.--A pipeful,\r\nto be smoked the same as tobacco.\r\n\r\n7. A cup of hot coffee or several of hot water. This is especially\r\neffective in cases arising from checked perspiration, from rheumatism,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nThese recipes are given to the public as being the principal agents\r\nemployed by the medical profession throughout the world. It must be\r\ndistinctly understood that they are not _curative_ but merely\r\n_palliative_, and used to relieve paroxysms. We object to them wholly\r\nand unqualifiedly because they contain NARCOTICS. It is a fundamental\r\nprinciple in our treatment not to use this class of remedies. They\r\nstupefy the brain, debilitate the nervous system, and have, in not a few\r\ninstances, formed an unfortunate appetite and habit, most difficult to\r\novercome. We are of the opinion that one of the chief reasons why this\r\nmalady has been considered incurable is the fact that physicians have\r\nalmost universally relied upon narcotic drugs. With such medication a\r\ncure is the exception. A cure can only be effected under such\r\ncircumstances when the _powers of nature are sufficient to overcome both\r\nthe_ NARCOTIC _and the_ DISEASE. That they will _relieve_ we do not\r\ndeny, but _they will never cure_. It reminds us of an old country doctor\r\nwho advised a lady to smoke tobacco to cure acid dyspepsia. She followed\r\nthe prescription for over thirty years and at last accounts was not\r\ncured yet. In all seriousness we ask would any other remedy except a\r\nnarcotic or stimulant be used with such persistency for anything like\r\nthis length of time? Is it not apparent that such agents form a habit\r\nwhich is often worse than the disease, and yet fail to effect a cure? We\r\nappreciate the necessity for relief, and do not blame sufferers for\r\navailing themselves of any means for this purpose. But they should not\r\nbe satisfied with relief only, but should look about for such a system\r\nof medication as will rid them of the disease completely and\r\npermanently. If a week's or a month's exemption is a \"foretaste of\r\nheaven,\" how incomparable are the comforts and happiness to be derived\r\nfrom a life-time immunity?\r\n\r\n\r\nMILLIONS OF DOLLARS\r\n\r\nare annually spent upon the advice of physicians, in traveling expenses,\r\nand hotel bills, by sufferers from asthma, or phthisic, in seeking a\r\nchange of climate that will be advantageous. It is the last expedient of\r\nthe doctor who is annoyed by the continued complaint of his unrelieved\r\npatient, and can only be made available by the wealthy. In some\r\ninstances the change is beneficial, but to be effectually so a permanent\r\nchange of residence is required. Most patients are unable or unwilling\r\nto do this. In some cases change only affords temporary relief, the\r\nattacks returning after a few months. Even the wealthy dislike to take\r\nsuch chances. The less opulent cannot think of such methods, and hence\r\nare compelled to bear their sufferings as best they can. In the majority\r\nof instances the \"change of climate\" is only an illusion, or only\r\ntemporarily beneficial at best. We can tell them a better way, and if\r\nthey are wise they will follow it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAY ASTHMA, OR HAY FEVER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis affection, known also as Hay Catarrh, Hay Fever, or Rose Cold\r\ndiffers but little in its manifestations, from coryza, or cold in the\r\nhead, save in its _inciting cause_, and in its element of periodicity.\r\nIn this latitude there are persons who, during summer or early fall, are\r\ninvariably attacked with acute congestion or inflammation of the upper\r\nair-passages, giving rise to sneezing, watery discharges from the nose\r\nand eyes, difficult respiration, fever, and general prostration. These\r\nsymptoms are supposed to be induced by the inhalation of pollen or odors\r\nfrom grasses or flowers, which at that time are supposed to give off\r\ncertain exhalations of an Irritating character. Unless arrested by\r\nmedical treatment, the disease lasts until cool weather, or the\r\noccurrence of a hard frost rids the atmosphere of the exciting\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nSome feather beds give off an odor which excites all the aggravated\r\nsymptoms of this disease. Thus it appears that certain emanations have\r\nthe power of inciting these inflammatory conditions in certain sensitive\r\nconstitutions. In all individuals suffering from this disease there is\r\nan over sensitiveness of the nervous system which admits of the\r\nappearance of such sudden and severe manifestations. Many cases\r\nsuffering only mild symptoms for the first few seasons, annually become\r\naggravated until severe spasmodic asthma is a regular, and sometimes\r\ncontinuous complication. A case or two are on record in which the odor\r\nfrom the body of a horse so induced these symptoms that the individual\r\ncould never ride or drive him.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. In mild cases, or when the attack first appears, the daily\r\nuse of Dr. Sage's Catarrh Remedy fluid will neutralize and wash away the\r\npoisonous particles which have found lodgment in the nasal passages. The\r\nRemedy is best applied with Dr. Pierce's Nasal Douche. When the disease\r\nhas existed the previous season it is necessary that the patient begin\r\nboth constitutional and local treatment four or six weeks prior to an\r\nexpected return of the disease. The nervous system should be\r\nstrengthened, and the resistance of the patient to the irritating\r\ninfluence of these pollens and odors so increased, that even though he\r\nmay be exposed, no severe symptoms will follow.\r\n\r\nDr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery will be found invaluable as an\r\nalterative, blood purifier, and nerve tonic, and should be taken\r\nregularly while Dr. Sage's Catarrh Remedy is being used locally for its\r\nantiseptic and curative properties. The action of the \"Discovery\" is\r\nespecially desired in cases that are so far advanced as to be attended\r\nwith asthmatic symptoms, such as difficult breathing, headache, and a\r\nfeeling of lassitude and prostration.\r\n\r\nIn very obstinate or distressing cases our specialists have been able to\r\nprescribe and send, by mail or express, special courses of treatment\r\nwhich have proven so effective as to cure the disease _permanently_, so\r\nthat it has not reappeared the following season. The treatment seems to\r\nhave produced such an impression upon the system as to have fortified\r\nthe individual against a return of the disease.\r\n\r\nIn rare cases morbid growths in the upper air-passages are of such a\r\nnature as in themselves to be a source of sufficient excitement to\r\nunbalance the nervous equilibrium so that the individual is thus\r\nrendered more susceptible to this disease. In such, or exceedingly\r\nobstinate cases a personal examination by our specialist is desirable,\r\nand often results in the use of such measures as give permanent relief.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONIALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the following letters had been written by your best known and most\r\nesteemed neighbors they could be no more worthy of your confidence than\r\nthey now are, coming, as they do, from well known, intelligent, and\r\ntrustworthy citizens, who, in their several neighborhoods, enjoy the\r\nfullest confidence and respect of all who know them.\r\n\r\nOut of thousands of similar letters received from former patrons, we\r\nhave selected these few at random, and have to regret that we can find\r\nroom only for this comparatively small number in this volume.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLEEDING FROM LUNGS, CONSUMPTION\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (Before)\r\nC.H. HARRIS, ESQ.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (After)\r\nC.H. HARRIS, ESQ.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--I wish to say to you that Doctor Pierce's Golden Medical\r\nDiscovery saved my life and has made me a man; my home-physician says I\r\nam good for forty years yet. You will remember that my case was a case\r\njust between life and death, and all of my friends were sure it was a\r\ncase of death, until I commenced taking a second bottle of \"Golden\r\nMedical Discovery,\" when I was able to sit up and the cough was very\r\nmuch better, and the bleeding from my lungs stopped, and before I had\r\ntaken six bottles of the \"Golden Medical Discovery\" my cough ceased and\r\nI was a new man and ready for business.\r\n\r\nAnd now I feel that it is a duty that I owe to my fellow-men to\r\nrecommend to them the \"Golden Medical Discovery\" and Dr. Sage's Catarrh\r\nRemedy, which saved my life when doctors and all kinds of medicines\r\nfailed to do me any good.\r\n\r\nI will send to you with this letter two of my photographs; one was taken\r\na few weeks before I was taken down sick in bed, and the other was taken\r\nafter I was well.\r\n\r\n    Yours respectfully,\r\n    C.H.

PIERCE, 663 Main Street, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n_Dear Sir_--I cannot recommend your \"Golden Medical Discovery\" too\r\nhighly. I had a severe chronic cough and I began to use that medicine\r\nand took only one bottle, and I have not been sick a day since. When I\r\nbegan to use your \"Golden Medical Discovery\" my weight was 104 pounds,\r\nand now I weigh 125 pounds.\r\n\r\n    Yours very truly,\r\n    Mrs. Anna Parsons\r\n\r\n\r\nSPITTING OF BLOOD. LUNG DISEASE.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: J.M. Hite, Esq.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--I can gladly recommend Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical\r\nDiscovery to all suffering from diseases for which you recommend it. In\r\nthe summer of 1888 I took a severe cold, which settled on my lungs and\r\nchest, and I suffered intensely with it. I tried several of our best\r\nphysicians here and they gave up all hopes of my recovery, and my\r\nfriends thought I would have to die, and I thought so myself, as the\r\ndoctors did not know what was the matter with me. In the morning, on\r\nrising, I would cough and spit blood for two hours, and I was pale and\r\nweak and not able to work any. I then ran across Dr. Pierce's\r\nadvertisement and I came to the conclusion I would try the \"Golden\r\nMedical Discovery,\" as it was so highly recommended. I was greatly\r\ndiscouraged when I began the use of the \"Discovery,\" but after I had\r\ntaken four or five bottles I then noticed I was getting better, and I\r\ncould stand it to work some, and kept on taking it till I took about\r\ntwenty or twenty-five bottles. It has been five years since I took it\r\nand have had no return of that trouble since. I gladly recommend your\r\nmedicine for I know it saved my life.\r\n\r\n    Yours respectfully,\r\n    JOHN M.

PIERCE, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n_Dear Sir_--I feel like taking you by the hand and saying, \"thank God,\r\nyou have saved my wife,\" for we had given her up. We had sat by her,\r\nwhen the doctor said she could not live till morning; so bad was her\r\nlung disease. Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery cured her.\r\n\r\n    MR. THOMAS McGILL.\r\n\r\nWhen her case was reported to the specialist of the Invalids' Hotel,\r\nMrs. McGill was suffering from pain in the chest, struggling for breath,\r\nhard dry cough; jarring hurt the chest; short breath, backache; uterine\r\ndisease, leucorrhea, menstruation scanty and painful; feet and ankles\r\nswollen; was confined to house most of the time; was given up by her\r\nhome physician. Her disease began six years before with \"lung disease\"\r\nwhich was followed by bleeding from lungs.\r\n\r\n\r\nCURES WHEN COD LIVER OIL FAILS.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--My wife a few years ago had hemorrhages of the lungs, and\r\nwe summoned our home physician. He checked the hemorrhage but failed to\r\ncure her. She had also a terrible cough and expectorated a great deal.\r\nShe wanted to see another doctor so I called one and he examined her.\r\nShe asked him whether she had consumption, and his answer was, \"Madam,\r\nit is very near consumption.\" He advised her to use cod liver oil, but\r\nthis gave but little relief. I happened to get hold of one of your\r\nlittle books that comes with each bottle of Dr. Pierce's medicines and I\r\nread some cases about like my wife's. I went to the drug store and\r\nprocured a bottle of Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery and my wife\r\ncommenced using it according to directions. She began to get better\r\nright away and her cough has left her. She used about ten bottles. She\r\nis in her fifty-fifth year and can walk ten or twelve miles without any\r\ntrouble. We are satisfied that her life and health have been saved by\r\nthe use of \"Golden Medical Discovery.\" As soon as she takes any cold she\r\ninsists upon having a bottle of her medicine, as she calls it, and that\r\nis the last we hear of her cold.\r\n\r\n    Yours respectfully,\r\n    Joseph D.

Williams, Esq. ]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--It has been about eight months since I quit using Dr.\r\nPierce's Golden Medical Discovery. When I commenced using it I only\r\nweighed 130 pounds. I had been suffering with malarial fever, chills,\r\nand lung disease for four years. I took treatment from many doctors, and\r\ntried many different kinds of patent medicines and all seemed to do no\r\ngood. Since I have used four bottles of \"Golden Medical Discovery\" and\r\none bottle of Dr. Pierce's Pleasant Pellets I feel well in every respect\r\n_and weigh 160 pounds instead of only 130_, my weight when I began its\r\nuse.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly,\r\n    ROBERT WILLIAMS,\r\n    Hazelton, Barber Co., Kas.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSUMPTION.\r\n\r\nALMOST RAISED FROM THE GRAVE.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MRS. VANSICKLIN.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--I have long felt it my duty to acknowledge to you what your\r\n\"Golden Medical Discovery \"and \"Pleasant Pellets\" have done for me. They\r\nalmost raised me from the grave. I had three brothers and one sister die\r\nof consumption, and I was speedily following after them. I had severe\r\ncough, pain, copious expectoration, and other alarming symptoms, and my\r\nfriends all thought I had but a few months to live. At this time I was\r\npersuaded to try your \"Discovery,\" and the first bottle acted like\r\nmagic. Of course I continued on with the medicine, and as a result I\r\ngained rapidly in strength. My friends were astonished. When I commenced\r\nthe use of your medicines, six years ago, I weighed but 120 and was\r\nsinking rapidly. I now weigh 135, and my health continues perfect. I\r\nhave a copy of your \"People's Common Sense Medical Adviser,\" and neither\r\nmoney nor friends could ever induce me to part with it.\r\n\r\nTwelve years later, Mrs. Vansicklin writes: \"My health still continues\r\n_perfect_. I now weigh 148 pounds. Your book--the Common Sense Medical\r\nAdviser is a treasure in our home.\" Yours truly,\r\n\r\n    MRS. H.H.

Henson, Esq. ]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--Two years ago I thought I had consumption, and was\r\ncontinually coughing day and night, and not able to work. I bought six\r\nbottles of Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery and it did me more good\r\nthan all the other medicine I ever took, and now I am feeling all O.K.,\r\nand I weigh 165 pounds. Two years ago I weighed 145 pounds. I can fully\r\nrecommend Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery to any person that has\r\nconsumption. I remain, Yours truly,\r\n\r\n    JOHN A.

Simmons, Esq.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--In 1872, when living in New York State, my health was very\r\npoor. I was clear \"run down.\" Pain in my lungs, right side and in my\r\nbowels; had been ailing for nearly two years; my feet swelled during the\r\nday so I could hardly stand it till night, as I was on my feet the most\r\nof the time.\r\n\r\nI wrote you and you sent me special medicines, which brought me around\r\nall right. I have weak lungs, and when I get run down I usually take a\r\nfew bottles of Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery, which always\r\nbuilds me up. We have used your \"Discovery\" in our family with the best\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nWhen living at Blue Mound I was very sick with inflammation of the lungs\r\nfrom taking cold. When I took cold I was at Clinton, Missouri. Was\r\nconfined to my bed for a few days. I said to the doctor that I must go\r\nhome; he advised me to stay where I was, but I started for Blue Mound\r\nwith my pulse at 140. When I arrived home I was glad to get in bed, and\r\ncalled in Dr. ----. He said my lungs were in a bad condition. Well, I\r\nwas very sick for three weeks or more, and when I got around I was not\r\nwell, and at that time Dr. ---- came to Blue Mound, stopped there two\r\nweeks, gave free lectures and had lots of patients. He examined me and\r\nsaid I needed treatment, and he could cure me.\r\n\r\nI was suffering all the time with pain in my right lung. He wanted\r\n$50.00 for treatment, and would cure. So I let him pass along and wrote\r\nto your Association for advice, which was to take the \"Discovery,\" and I\r\ntook one-half dozen bottles which \"filled the bill.\" Yours respectfully,\r\n\r\n    A.D. SIMMONS,\r\n    Emporia, Lyon Co., Kansas.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSUMPTION.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mrs. Smith.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--It is my pleasant duty to you and to suffering humanity to\r\nacknowledge the benefit I received from Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical\r\nDiscovery. About seven years ago I became troubled with my\r\nlungs--consumption in its first stage. Some of my friends in Ontario had\r\nbeen using your medicine before I knew anything of it; and after coming\r\nto this country, I commenced taking it, and I think it has done wonders\r\nfor me. I am positive, that if any one will persist in taking it, it\r\nwill do all you say. It has done so much for me that I feel it my duty\r\nto testify to its wonderful curative properties. Respectfully,\r\n\r\n    MRS. JESSE K. SMITH,\r\n    Baldur, Selkirk Co., Manitoba.\r\n\r\n\r\nDYSPEPSIA AND NASAL CATARRH.\r\n\r\nDR. PIERCE, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: J. Larson, Esq.]\r\n\r\n_Dear Sir_--I had been very badly troubled for many years with\r\ndyspepsia, also nasal catarrh, and got so bad and weak that I could not\r\nwork. I could hardly eat anything without vomiting; had a pain in the\r\nstomach and a burning sensation coming into the throat. I took Dr.\r\nPierce's Golden Medical Discovery and \"Pleasant Pellets,\" and can truly\r\nsay these medicines have helped me wonderfully. I improved right along\r\nfrom the very beginning. I stopped taking medicine in the latter part of\r\nMay and then felt as well as ever in my life. I am pretty well now, for\r\na man of sixty-three years. I can eat all kinds of food and it doesn't\r\ncause me any pain in the stomach as it always did before I took Dr.\r\nPierce's medicines. I can cheerfully say to the public that they need\r\nnot hesitate in taking Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery for\r\ndyspepsia; it will eradicate and cure the disease if anything will.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly,\r\n    JOHN LARSON, Ashby, Grant Co., Minn.\r\n\r\n\r\nLUNG DISEASE.\r\n\r\nDr. R.V. PIERCE, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: J.J. Hume, Esq.]\r\n\r\n_Dear Sir_--I cheerfully make the following statement: In February,\r\n1893, I was attacked with a severe illness. It came on very gradually,\r\nand was attended with a severe cough and expectoration; also had pain in\r\nthe lungs; had chills and night-sweats; was much reduced in strength.\r\nAfter trying for relief in different directions without success, I was\r\ninduced to apply to your eminent Staff of Physicians at 603 Main St.,\r\nBuffalo, N.Y., and I am happy to say that my improvement began as soon\r\nas I began the use of the medicines which were prescribed for me at that\r\ntime. The improvement has been continuous, until I now feel my lungs are\r\nentirely cured; have no cough, no expectoration in the last month, and\r\nmy usual weight of 183 pounds has been restored. Have been able to do a\r\nfair day's work any time during the past two mouths without unusual\r\nfatigue. I can cheerfully recommend your Institution to persons\r\nsimilarly affected, and will authorize you to refer any one making\r\ninquiry to me.\r\n\r\n    Yours respectfully,\r\n    J.J.

I tried your medicine and it helped me. Last\r\nspring I had a bad cough; got so bad I had to be in bed all the time. My\r\nhusband thought I had consumption. He wanted me to get a doctor, but I\r\ntold him if it was consumption they could not help me. We thought we\r\nwould try Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery and before I had taken\r\none bottle the cough was stopped and I have had no more of it returning.\r\n\r\n    Respectfully yours,\r\n    Jennie Dingman\r\n\r\n\r\nSEVERE COUGH.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mrs. Jewell.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--I want to say a word in favor of your medicine. I can not\r\ndo it justice by mere words.\r\n\r\nI was taken sick the 5th of July; I called a doctor but did not receive\r\nany benefit from him. I was going into quick consumption. Had a terrible\r\ncough, raised a great deal of phlegm; had pain through chest, was very\r\nweak and all run-down.\" I told my husband to get a bottle of \"Golden\r\nMedical Discovery;\" he did so; I commenced taking it and I began to get\r\nbetter. I was not outside of the door yard, from July 5th, until August\r\n22d. I only took two bottles, and the first of September I was able to\r\ndo the work for boarders, and have had boarders ever since. It is the\r\ngrandest medicine ever invented.\r\n\r\n    Respectfully, Mrs. CHARLES JEWELL,\r\n    (P.O.

When I began\r\ntaking your medicines I thought my time was short. I have not spit up\r\nblood now for about four months, and am feeling much better. Our home\r\ndoctor says my temperature and pulse are all right now; and that I do\r\nnot need further medicine, and that I will get all right again. I feel\r\nthat your medicine has done wonders for me. I would have written sooner,\r\nbut I was waiting to see if the improvement Would be permanent.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly,\r\n    D.Y.

Cummins, Esq.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--I have felt inclined to say to you, and your whole staff of\r\nphysicians, and now do convey to you, my heart-felt gratitude for your\r\nable and skillful assistance rendered me in my afflictions. I had been\r\nfor years a sufferer, and at times nearly despondent. I had been treated\r\nby the most able and skillful physicians that this north-western country\r\ncould provide. I had paid them large sums of money and was finally given\r\nto understand that there was no hope for my cure. Your advertisements\r\nfell into my hands, which treated upon my case. I read and compared my\r\ncase with the insight you so ably explained, so I was satisfied you\r\nunderstood your profession well. I started full of hope and as I reached\r\nBuffalo, after three days' travel by rail, some 1,500 miles, there was\r\nsomething that cheered me on. I made my way to your Invalids' Hotel. I\r\nwas examined and pronounced curable. I was operated upon for a local\r\naffection that caused much of my suffering, the same day I arrived, and\r\nin ten days was discharged permanently cured. I have felt perfectly well\r\never since. I was nicely treated by the able nurses and attendants who\r\nwere always gentle and kind.\r\n\r\nI can cheerfully say to the public, that they need not hesitate in\r\nthrowing themselves into your kind care in every case that is curable by\r\nthe hand of man, and you will treat them honestly.\r\n\r\nHoping this may be of some benefit to some afflicted persons who may\r\nfeel some diffidence in trusting themselves in your hands.\r\n\r\n    Yours respectfully, H.

I might have been entirely well if\r\nI had been able to have kept the medicine to take as directed. I have\r\ntaken only four bottles, and it would be four or five months from the\r\ntime I would take one bottle till I could get another one. I can talk\r\nbetter, and feel almost like a new person to what I did two years ago. I\r\nweigh more and can do any kind of work. Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical\r\nDiscovery is the only medicine that did me any good.\r\n\r\n    Your friend,\r\n    MRS. RACHEL D.

I had\r\ntried three doctors--took over one dozen bottles of patent medicines,\r\nwithout relief.\r\n\r\nI had chills with hacking cough; my friends said I had consumption; was\r\nreduced in flesh and nerve till the least work or exercise would exhaust\r\nme completely.\r\n\r\nThanks for the day I wrote you, for I sent you ten dollars, and received\r\nfour bottles of medicine which I took, and have been able to do hard\r\nwork. I have never had any symptoms of those dreaded chills since. My\r\nweight got as low as 135 pounds; now I weigh 175 pounds.

Jones, Esq. ]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--For the benefit of the afflicted, I wish to say, that I\r\nvisited your Institution in 1889, completely broken down in health and\r\nsuffering, as I thought, from heart disease and consumption. I had spent\r\nmoney with many of our home physicians, but they only gave me partial\r\nrelief and I would soon be worse than ever. When I spoke of coming to\r\nyou, the doctors here cried \"humbug,\" but I told them I had been\r\nhumbugged at home and if I staid I would surely die, and if I went could\r\ndo no worse. I spent thirty days at your Invalids' Hotel and Surgical\r\nInstitute, and came away like a new man, comparatively speaking. I found\r\nthe Institution all it had been represented, and I may truthfully say,\r\nthat the time spent there was to me as an oasis in a desert to a weary\r\nand thirsty traveler; for those were among the happiest days of my life.\r\nNo pains were spared to make each patient comfortable and at home. I\r\ncannot recommend your Institution too highly, for I feel that to your\r\ntreatment I owe my life. I have sold a great deal of your medicines, and\r\nrecommend them with the same faith I would water to the thirsty. They,\r\nthe \"Pellets,\" \"Golden Medical Discovery\" and \"Favorite Prescription,\"\r\ngive universal satisfaction. You are at liberty to use this as you\r\ndesire, for my only motive in writing is to benefit the afflicted, by\r\npointing out to them a place of cure; for, no matter what their disease,\r\nI am confident that if medical skill can avail, they can be cured at the\r\nInvalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly,\r\n    J.F.

My physicians and friends\r\nhad given me up to die; I was reduced to a perfect skeleton; my strength\r\nwas gone; my eyesight was so dim I could scarcely see at all, and I had\r\nno appetite--could not eat anything at all when I commenced using Doctor\r\nPierce's Family Medicines. I have taken sixteen bottles of the \"Golden\r\nMedical Discovery,\" twelve bottles of \"Pellets\" and three bottles of\r\n\"Favorite Prescription,\" and to-day I am well and strong and weigh 128\r\npounds--two pounds more than I ever before weighed in my life.\r\n\r\n    Your true friend,\r\n    Mrs. Sarah A.

During that time she\r\ngained rapidly in strength; the lungs became normal, the cough leaving\r\nher entirely. We are never without this medicine in the house, and have\r\nrecommended it to all our friends, and I am positively certain that if\r\nDr. Pierce's medicine is used in time, it will cure in other cases as\r\nwell as in this one.\r\n\r\n    Yours respectfully,\r\n    MRS.

My lungs were\r\nbadly affected, and body reduced to a skeleton. My people commenced to\r\ngive me your \"Medical Discovery\" and I soon began to mend. It was not\r\nlong before I became well enough to take charge of my household duties\r\nagain. I owe my recovery to Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery.\r\n\r\n    Respectfully yours,\r\n    MRS.

Had it not been for Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery I\r\nwould not be a well man to-day. One bottle stopped the cough and night\r\nsweats.\r\n\r\nMy wife was troubled with leucorrhea so bad that we did not know what to\r\ndo until Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription was brought into the house\r\nand gave her rest.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly,\r\n    H.M.

Lees, Esq. ]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--I am 29 years old. During the winter of '84 I contracted a\r\nsevere cold, which settled on my lungs. Each succeeding winter my cough\r\ngrew worse, and in the winter of '85 I had chicken-pox, and taking cold,\r\ndrove them in causing me a severe spell of sickness. The following\r\nsummer I had congestion of the lungs and hemorrhage and a severe spell\r\nof fever. My physician advised me to go West in search of health. My\r\nfriends thought I had consumption of the lungs, I coughed so much. In\r\nSeptember, 1889, I left Carthage, Mo. (where I then lived), for Phoenix,\r\nAriz. After I had been there about four months I had a severe attack of\r\n\"_La Grippe_\" and with this I coughed myself almost (I thought), to\r\ndeath; and to add to my distress I had an almost intolerable attack of\r\npleurisy. A doctor was summoned and after an examination said I had\r\nEmpyemia, and said he could do me but very little good until he removed\r\nthe pus. He and his partner came and by the use of an aspirator drew off\r\nnine pints of pus; after about a week he drew off two pints. After a few\r\ndays I told my doctor I could hear the pus gurgle as I had before he\r\ndrew it off. Strange to say, but nevertheless true, my heart was crowded\r\nover on the opposite side for three months. I knew it was there for I\r\ncould feel the pulsations there, and I was so short of breath for a long\r\ntime I could not stoop down to tie my shoes.\r\n\r\nThe doctor told me it would be useless again to use the aspirator, but\r\nthat he would be obliged to make an incision in my side and treat it\r\ntill I got well. On the 28th day of March. 1890, my doctor and his\r\npartner and three other doctors undertook the operation, and, after\r\nremoving about two inches of one of my ribs, withdrew 16 pints of pus.\r\nThis came near being too much for me though I slowly recovered and in\r\nthree months the doctors thought I was able to come home. I arrived home\r\nin June and was very poorly all summer, and did not sit up but _very\r\nlittle_, and had fever every day. In the latter part of the summer of\r\n'90 I commenced to take \"Golden Medical Discovery\" and although my side\r\nhad been discharging for TWENTY-THREE MONTHS it healed up sound and\r\nwell. I am now able to do considerable hard work. I would advise all who\r\nare afflicted as I was, to give your medicine a trial. I am glad I have\r\nout-lived my friends' expectations.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly,\r\n    CHARLES E. LEES,\r\n    P.O.

Nienhuis. ]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--I had pain in lungs and across the chest; had been spitting\r\nblood for the past six years. Menstruation was scant and caused great\r\nprostration. Suffered from constipation; cutting pains about the stomach\r\nand rumbling in the bowels; exceedingly nervous; indigestion. She writes\r\nas follows: \"I wish to inform you that I am well. I never can praise you\r\nor your ways of treatment enough. I shall bring you all the patients\r\nthat I can. I feel so rich to get my health back. I can eat well and\r\nsleep well, and work all day. I suppose you will think it took a long\r\ntime to pull me up, but I was very low, much worse than I ever told you\r\nof at the time. I was not able even to feed myself any more. My husband\r\nhad to undress me. I could not wash my own face, or stand alone. I did\r\nnot lie down to sleep for eleven months; I always had to sit up, because\r\nI would choke if I laid my head down. _I have not raised a drop of blood\r\nsince your treatment_, and I did it always for five years before. Our\r\nminister said this spring that he had never thought I could live, and\r\nsays that he advises every one that is sick to go to you. He was so\r\nsurprised to see how strong and well I was. My relatives all think that\r\nyou ought to write my case up for the papers in Chicago. I can never\r\nrepay you for what you have done for me. A thousand thanks is but empty\r\nwords. My husband was telling a man just last week, \"do not spend all\r\nyour money in Chicago, as we did, and then write to Buffalo, but go and\r\nwrite now, and your wife will soon be well.\" My father was saying that\r\nhe wished the doctors that gave me up could see me now. I think they\r\ncould not believe their own eyes. I am astonished when I think back how\r\nI was six years ago; I could not walk across the room alone for three\r\nyears, and after taking your treatment for eighteen months, I am\r\n_completely_ well. I can hardly believe it myself when I read over those\r\nletters that I received from you. I work hard every day. There is never\r\na day that you are not remembered. I hope that you may live many years\r\nto do for others what you have done for me. I had this taken so that you\r\nmight have my picture as I am now; I wish you could have seen me as I\r\nwas then, and I wish to thank you for those little notes of inquiry that\r\nyou used to send to find out how I was getting along, which showed that\r\nI was remembered not only while the money lasted, but that you cared for\r\nme after that.\"\r\n\r\n    Respectfully yours,\r\n    MRS.

I had four doctors to see me, but it just\r\nseemed to me that they could relieve me for only a short while. I had a\r\nbad cough and all thought I was going into consumption. After being sick\r\nfor so long, my nerves were nearly exhausted and my stomach, liver and\r\nbowels refused to act, in fact, my whole system was completely wrecked.\r\nI could not rest nor sleep, unless influenced by some drug and at last,\r\nmother concluded to try your medicines on me. She had taken them about a\r\nyear before and had been greatly benefited by their use, so she said I\r\nwill try the last resort--for I had been given up to die.\r\n\r\nI began taking your \"Golden Medical Discovery\" and \"Pleasant Pellets.\" I\r\nimproved rapidly--was soon able to be up in my room, and to my surprise,\r\nI could eat a little of nearly everything I desired. Before I began the\r\nuse of your medicines, I could eat nothing in peace; I would almost\r\ncramp to death, even when I took a little cold water.\r\n\r\nBut after the use of four and a half bottles of your \"Golden Medical\r\nDiscovery,\" and two vials of \"Pellets,\" with God's help, I have almost\r\nrisen from the dead.\r\n\r\nI will cheerfully recommend your remedies to my afflicted friends, for I\r\nam to-day, well and strong as ever.

Wilder, Esq.]\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--Some twenty-five years since I was feeling very miserable\r\nall summer; I was very bilious; sometimes my bowels would not move once\r\nin sixty or seventy hours, and then almost impossible. I would take some\r\nbitters, which would help to move the matter, but as soon as the bitters\r\nwere gone, I had to buy more or I would be as bad as before, and\r\nsometimes worse; but none of them appeared to do me any good except to\r\nmove the bowels, until thirty years since a druggist called my attention\r\nto Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery, and before I had taken half a\r\nbottle of the \"Golden Medical Discovery\" I felt much better and by the\r\ntime I had taken all, I could eat three hearty meals per day and had not\r\nfelt so well for a long time. Soon after I was called to do a job some\r\nmiles from home, and one night the old lady there was speaking about her\r\ndaughter, (Mrs. Brooks) who had been under the doctor's care for five\r\nmonths and did not get any better, and I learned by asking a few\r\nquestions that she had no appetite, and no ambition to do anything. Then\r\nI told her what the \"Golden Medical Discovery\" had done for me. The next\r\nday the old lady drove down to her daughter's, and got Mr. Brooks to\r\nsend to Rutland--ten miles away--for two bottles of the \"Golden Medical\r\nDiscovery,\" and the next day the doctor came, and when about to take\r\nleave, Mr. Brooks told the doctor he did not want him any more at\r\npresent and would send for him if necessary. I saw the old lady about\r\nten days later and her daughter was improving, and Mr. Brooks had great\r\nfaith in the \"Golden Medical Discovery,\" and had not sent for the\r\ndoctor, but had gone to Rutland for more of the \"G.M.D.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I commenced taking the \"Golden Medical Discovery.\" I thought I was\r\ngoing into consumption as had a cough for three years or more and my\r\nweight decreasing. My weight before taking the \"G.M.D.\" was 133 pounds;\r\nlast March it was 147 pounds, and I give the credit to the \"Discovery.\"\r\n\r\n    Yours respectfully,\r\n    GEORGE I.

To the surprise of\r\nmyself and family, I was, in a short time, changed almost to a new\r\nperson--from pale sallow complexion to the bloom of health again. Many\r\nthanks for restoring me from an untimely grave. I will say to the public\r\nit is not always necessary to go to the Institute; I was treated at home\r\nwith success.

Snead, who has been very low,\r\nwas almost given up by two physicians, who treated her with their best\r\nskill, and did not receive much benefit. She was first attacked with\r\npneumonia and pleurisy in very bad form and was then taken with a very\r\nbad cough, which kept growing worse and worse, until finally it seemed\r\nas though she had consumption very bad. The physicians prescribed Cod\r\nliver oil, but to no benefit. Mrs. Miller, a neighbor of ours,\r\nrecommended Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery to me with very strong\r\nfaith, as she had been in the same condition and was cured by its use. I\r\nprocured two bottles and she grew better. She hasn't felt any return of\r\nlung disease in over twelve months. She was nothing but a skeleton when\r\nshe took the first dose, and to-day she weighs 135 pounds. I thought it\r\nmy duty to write to you in regard to her case, as so many other\r\nmedicines had failed, and it has acted like a charm.\r\n\r\n    Respectfully yours,\r\n    MRS. SARAH E.

I have\r\nhad weak lungs for several years--at times spit up blood. In January,\r\n1893, I took a severe cold, which settled on my lungs--had a very bad\r\ncough, it seemed as if my lungs were swollen; could not expectorate much\r\nat a time, very hard to get up; suffered much with pains in my chest;\r\nwas reduced in flesh and became very weak.\r\n\r\nPhysicians prescribed for me but I found no relief until I consulted\r\nyou. It seemed I was going into consumption very fast. I have as good\r\nhealth now as could be expected. I am fifty-seven years of age and able\r\nto work on my farm, and feel under many obligations for your kind\r\nadvice. Also my stomach was out of order, suffered with burning in my\r\nstomach and chest.

Of course at first I paid but little attention to it, hoping it\r\nwould amount to nothing and probably wear away. But I slowly but surely\r\ngrew worse, and at last resolved to apply to the doctors for help. My\r\nwater came often, and in small quantities, and with great pain, and with\r\nred brick-dust deposit. I was attacked with severe womb trouble, bloody\r\npiles and dropsy of the ovary. I was treated by five different doctors.\r\nI was compelled to wear an inside support for a year, but it still\r\nseemed impossible for me to get well and I began to feel exceedingly\r\nalarmed and very uneasy, not knowing what course to pursue, or what the\r\nconsequences might be. I had heard of Dr. Pierce, and concluded to make\r\none more trial, so I sat down and wrote a letter to him, stating matters\r\nas near as I could, and in due time I received a favorable reply; then I\r\ncommenced with his medicine. I commenced somewhere in February 1891 with\r\nthe \"Golden Medical Discovery\" and \"Favorite Prescription,\" in alternate\r\ndoses. A strange occurrence followed. My limbs felt like what we call\r\n\"asleep,\" and I felt as if I were in a strange land and wondered what\r\nwas going to take place. I kept on till I took nine bottles. The first\r\nrelief I felt was from sick headache, which I had been troubled with for\r\nmany years; I was also cured of a very bad cough which I had been\r\ntroubled with for many years, and of dyspepsia of long standing. I was\r\nentirely cured of a very singular and severe itching on my back, between\r\nmy shoulders, which our doctor's called winter itch and which they\r\npronounced incurable. I had suffered with this for twenty years; it\r\nwould come in the winter and go away in the summer. I was also cured of\r\nthe worst form of bloody piles and of womb disease. At present I feel\r\nlike a new person.\r\n\r\nWhen I first commenced with Dr. Pierce's medicines, I could not walk\r\nhalf a mile without a pain. The other day I walked to Mercersburgh\r\npost-office, a distance of twelve miles, and the next day walked back\r\nagain, and felt no bad results from the Journey. I am now 51 years old.\r\n\r\nMrs. Knavel further writes, that \"To any person desiring to know more\r\nconcerning my case and its wonderful cure, and who will enclose to me a\r\nreturn self-addressed and stamped envelope for reply, I will be pleased\r\nto write further information.\"\r\n\r\n    Yours respectfully,\r\n    SARAH A.

I\r\ncould do no work hardly until I used Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical\r\nDiscovery. After using five bottles of the \"Golden Medical Discovery\"\r\nand three vials of the \"Pleasant Pellets\" I was cured, and now I am\r\ndoing the work for a family of nine. I tried other medicines and nothing\r\nwould do me any good, and if I had not gotten your medicine I would have\r\nbeen in my grave. I could not recommend it too highly for the good it\r\ndid me; it is the best medicine I ever got hold of.\r\n\r\n    MRS. E.C. VAN BOSKIRK,\r\n    Selin's Grove, Snyder Co.,Penn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"COMPLETELY BROKEN DOWN\"\r\n\r\nFROM DYSPEPSIA, CATARRH, SPINAL DISEASE--NERVOUS PROSTRATION.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: C.M. Niles, Esq.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--I wish to express my heartfelt thanks to you for the\r\nwonderful cure that your special remedies performed in my case. In the\r\nSpring of 1891, I had a severe attack of La Grippe, which left me in bad\r\nshape. I consulted as good a physician as there was in the county, and\r\nhe told me that I was suffering from enlargement of the heart and that I\r\nmust be very careful about taking: any violent exercise, and I must not\r\nallow myself to get excited, as excitement of any kind might prove\r\nfatal. He gave me remedies for my trouble which made me feel some\r\nbetter; but being a farmer I was obliged to work hard and soon began to\r\nrun down. I began to have spells of a terribly deathly sinking feeling\r\nat my stomach and a terrible pressure at the heart--in the region of the\r\nheart, and sometimes I would fall prostrate and although I was conscious\r\nall the time I could not speak aloud.\r\n\r\nThe last of October, 1891, while doing my chores in the morning, I had\r\none of those bad spells and upset my lantern, which resulted in my\r\nlosing my buildings by fire.\r\n\r\nMy wife was out of health at that time--she, too, was suffering from the\r\neffects of La Grippe. Having lost everything eatable for ourselves and\r\nstock, I was forced to work very hard to get through the winter. The\r\nnext February, 1892, we had another attack of La Grippe, which resulted\r\nin the death of my beloved wife. The next May, this terrible affliction\r\ntogether with hard work completely broke me down and although I was\r\ndoctoring all the time I kept steadily growing worse. I got so bad that\r\nI could not sleep more than two or three hours any night and very often\r\nI would go all night without closing my eyes at all.\r\n\r\nThe last of September, I had to give up work almost entirely. I got so\r\nthat I _could not walk one-fourth of a mile without being completely\r\nexhausted_. One physician whom I consulted said I was suffering with\r\nnervous prostration and gave me medicine for it, but I got no better. My\r\nfood distressed me terribly and after eating, it would sour and I would\r\nhave to vomit up the most that I had eaten. At last, I got so I had to\r\nlive on bread made of wheat middlings and for about three months I could\r\nnot eat anything else, although it seemed as though I should starve to\r\ndeath. I thought I would give anything if I could eat a hearty meal of\r\nanything that I wanted, but did not dare to because every kind of food\r\ndistressed me so. My bowels became badly constipated and for three\r\nmonths I did not have a natural operation of the bowels; and I suffered\r\nvery much with catarrh, and there was such a pressure across my forehead\r\nthat it seemed sometimes as though it would burst. I became very\r\ndespondent. I did not want to go anywhere, neither did I want to see any\r\none, everything looked dark and gloomy to me. When well, I was naturally\r\nor a lively disposition and a great hand to joke with my friends, but no\r\none could say anything funny enough to get a smile out of me then. I was\r\nalways very fond of music too, but I could not bear to hear a bit of\r\nmusic, neither vocal nor instrumental. About the first of February,\r\n1893, some of my friends prevailed upon me to consult a physician who\r\nmade a specialty of treating chronic nervous troubles; he said I had no\r\norganic trouble of the heart and that it was caused by my stomach being\r\nout of order; he said that I had a bad kidney trouble and that my spine\r\nwas affected, and that unless I got help it would end in \"Locomotor\r\nAtaxia.\" He said he could help me but it would probably take a year to\r\ncure me. He let me have a month's treatment and gave me advice in regard\r\nto diet, etc. I thought for awhile that it was helping me but soon I\r\nbegan to go down hill again, and as a last resort I began to take some\r\nof the cure-alls (patent) with which the country is flooded; but I soon\r\nbecame disgusted with them and made up my mind there was no help for me.\r\nI had to use about all the strength I had to walk; I could not lift my\r\nleft foot up to step over anything--had to draw it after me; I could\r\nhardly sleep; neither could I transact any business, in fact I did not\r\ntake any interest in any of my affairs. It seemed to me as though I did\r\nnot have a friend on earth, and I longed for death to come to put me out\r\nof my misery.\r\n\r\nMy son, with whom I was living, had been trying for a long time to get\r\nme to send to you for treatment, but I had paid out so much money and\r\nreceived no benefit from it, that I did not believe there was any help\r\nfor me.\r\n\r\nAt last I thought I would write you what I could of my symptoms, and get\r\nyour opinion of my case, but it took me about two days to write the\r\nletter. My head felt so bad that I could not collect myself enough to\r\ndescribe my feelings. You wrote me that my trouble was caused by\r\nindigestion, dyspepsia, catarrh, and spinal affection, and that you\r\ncould cure me, and in fact, make a new man of me if I would send for\r\nyour special treatment and follow your advice. My son sent for the\r\nmedicine for me. I took it and followed your directions as near as I\r\ncould; the first week I could not see much of any change--the second\r\nweek I could see that I was improving some, the third week I could look\r\nback and see that I had gained considerable. I could sleep better; the\r\nbloating in my bowels did not trouble me so bad; my stomach did not\r\ndistress me so much and I could eat different kinds of food and my\r\ndigestion seemed to be improving fast; and by using your Special Catarrh\r\nRemedy my nose began to run (it had been nearly six months that my nose\r\nwas perfectly dry) and one day it felt as though something gave way in\r\nmy head--it seemed to be back, in behind my eyes, and I blowed a large\r\namount of filth out of my head that looked like the yolk of an egg, and\r\nit was nearly as thick as jelly; after that my head began to improve\r\nrapidly and I began to gain in flesh and strength, and the best of all\r\nis, I have kept right on gaining until at the present time _I feel as\r\nwell as I ever did in my life_. Sleep well, can eat three hearty meals\r\nevery day and digest them too, and eat anything I want, and seven days\r\nin a week.\r\n\r\nTo look back now I don't see why I did not apply to you when I was first\r\ntaken sick. For about ten years ago. I had treatment of you for catarrh,\r\nliver and kidney trouble, and you helped me then; also, about eight\r\nyears ago my wife had two months' treatment from you which helped her of\r\nthe troubles from which she was suffering at that time. All the reasons\r\nthat I can give, is, that owing to financial troubles and having to pay\r\nout so much for sickness, I could not seem to get the money (that I\r\ncould spare) to pay for the treatment.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I wish I could express my thanks to you for what you have\r\ndone for me, but I cannot do it. I am a poor hand to express myself, but\r\nI consider my restoration to health almost a miracle, and I firmly\r\nbelieve that I owe my life to you, for I do not believe that I should\r\nhave lived till the present time had it not been for your Special\r\nTreatment. Now, if there is any part of this letter that you would wish\r\nto publish, you are at liberty to do so: and if it would be the means of\r\ndirecting any suffering fellow being to a place where they can get\r\nrelief, I shall be very thankful.\r\n\r\n    Respectfully,\r\n    C.M.

Baldwin, Esq.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--For a long time I was suffering from indigestion, catarrh\r\nand nervousness. I was so run down that I could not go to school, and,\r\nas the various remedies I tried did me no good, I applied to you, and\r\nwas advised to try a course of special treatment. After taking only two\r\nmonths' medicines from your noble institution, I feel perfectly restored\r\nto health. I have, moreover, recovered my lost flesh, and I am pleased\r\nto say need no further medicines.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly,\r\n    E.A.

We had several physicians attending her, but they gave her\r\nonly temporary relief. We were advised by a friend who had used your\r\nremedies to try them. After using thirteen bottles of Doctor Sage's\r\nCatarrh Remedy, and at the same time two bottles of Doctor Pierce's\r\nGolden Medical Discovery my daughter was completely cured of the dreaded\r\ndisease and in the past three years has had no symptoms of the disease\r\never coming back. I am satisfied the above medicines will cure any kind\r\nof catarrh.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly,\r\n    JOSEPH POLLAK,\r\n    McPherson, McPherson Co., Kan.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONIC NASAL CATARRH\r\n\r\nRESULTED IN LUNG DISEASE.

Converse, Esq.]\r\n\r\n_Dear Sir_--Without solicitation from you, I feel it my duty to\r\nsuffering humanity, to make known the virtues of your medicine in curing\r\ncatarrh. About ten years ago, I first began to realize that I was the\r\nvictim of nasal catarrh; I tried every known remedy, but gradually grew\r\nworse. My ears would gather and break; nights of restlessness would\r\nsucceed days of agony. The disease finally attacked my left lung, and I\r\ndespaired of obtaining relief. About six years since I began the use of\r\nDr. Sage's Catarrh Remedy, in connection with the \"Golden Medical\r\nDiscovery,\" and by the persistent use of the above remedies I feel that\r\nI am completely cured of this loathsome disease.\r\n\r\nFor attacks of biliousness, coughs and colds, I think there is nothing\r\nequal to the \"Discovery,\" and I bless the day that I first began the use\r\nof your remedies.\r\n\r\n    Very respectfully,\r\n    HOWARD J.

A hunch came on the side and\r\nback of my head--my whole head and face were so sore and sensitive that\r\na pillow of down felt hard, and I was obliged to change my position\r\noften. I could not breathe through my nose at all and was obliged to\r\nkeep my bed fully one half of the time, and could not collect my\r\nthoughts to think steadily on any subject--I was really afraid of losing\r\nmy reason. I got all run-down and was \"out of sorts\" in general; then I\r\ncommenced using Dr. Sage's Catarrh Remedy and Dr. Pierce's Golden\r\nMedical Discovery. To-day my health is good and I have no catarrh.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly,\r\n    MRS. JAMES LANSING,\r\n    Fort Edward, Washington Co., N.Y.\r\n\r\n\r\nCATARRH AND GENERAL DEBILITY.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Thos. Lewis, Esq.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--Being an invalid for many years and trying home physicians\r\nwithout benefit, I went to the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute,\r\nand can most highly recommend this place to all sufferers. I had a\r\nsevere attack of catarrh and general debility, and after a short stay at\r\nthis Institute, my whole system was toned up and I was soon enjoying\r\nperfect health.\r\n\r\nI can truthfully say that this institution fully merits all the praise\r\nthat could be given it. I never lose an opportunity to recommend all my\r\nsuffering friends to the Faculty of this Association, for I believe it\r\nis in advance of its kind in the world. The physicians and surgeons are\r\nskillful and of wide experience, the nurses kind and thoughtful, the\r\nrooms large and pleasant, and everything is done to make the visit of\r\nany one pleasant as well as beneficial in the highest degree.\r\n\r\nI do not hesitate to urge all invalids, no matter what their trouble, to\r\nplace themselves under the care of the eminent physicians of this\r\ninstitution, being confident that they can give them all the relief that\r\npossibly can be obtained from medical treatment and skill.\r\n\r\n    Truly yours,\r\n    THOMAS LEWIS,\r\n    Kamas, Summit County, Utah.\r\n\r\n\r\nCATARRH AND LIVER COMPLAINT.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wm. King, Esq.]\r\n\r\n_Dear Sirs_--After suffering for several years with nasal catarrh and\r\nliver complaint, and having become greatly reduced in health, as a last\r\nresort I placed myself in your hands for treatment My improvement began\r\nalmost immediately after entering your institution. I was enabled to\r\nleave at the end of one month, having experienced great benefit. The\r\ntreatment was continued at home for a few months, after which my cure\r\nwas complete. At the present time, I am able for office work, and feel\r\nthat I am completely cured of the catarrh and have but little if any\r\ntrouble with my liver. I shall lose no opportunity to recommend your\r\ninstitution or your medicines to the afflicted. I do most unhesitatingly\r\nrecommend chronic sufferers to visit your institution or take your\r\nremedies at home.\r\n\r\n    Sincerely yours,\r\n    WILLIAM KING,\r\n    Rose Bud,\r\n    Pope Co., Ills.\r\n\r\n\r\nCATARRH, BRONCHITIS, LIVER COMPLAINT AND DYSPEPSIA.\r\n\r\nEly, White Pine Co., Nevada.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--For ten years I was greatly afflicted with Catarrh,\r\nBronchitis, Liver Complaint, and Dyspepsia. I tried many doctors and\r\nremedies to see if I could not obtain relief, but I grew constantly\r\nworse instead of better.\r\n\r\nI heard much concerning the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute at\r\nBuffalo. I concluded to go there and try and obtain some benefit. I\r\nstaid a month in this famous Institution, and during that time made fine\r\nimprovement, and when I left felt like another man.\r\n\r\nI can truthfully recommend this world-renowned Institution to all the\r\nafflicted. The Institution itself, in all its appointments, is far in\r\nadvance of the age. It is more like a home than a hospital; the rooms\r\nare large and pleasant; the table the very best; the nurses kind and\r\nconsiderate, and the doctors skillful and of wide experience. While\r\nthere I saw and talked with a great number of people who had come to\r\nthis Institution as a last resort, and they were all unanimous in their\r\npraise.\r\n\r\nI cannot say too much in favor of the World's Dispensary Medical\r\nAssociation and its Staff of skilled attendants, nor can I too strongly\r\nurge all sufferers to go there, being confident that all within the\r\npower of medical science and skill can be done for them there. Would\r\nsend you my photograph as requested, but there is not a photograph\r\ngallery within a hundred miles of here. Yours truly,\r\n\r\nD.D.

Some of my friends\r\nthought I had consumption; I got so weak I could scarcely walk across\r\nthe floor, and raised a good deal. I commenced taking Dr. Pierce's\r\nGolden Medical Discovery and my cough soon got better, and I have not\r\nbeen troubled with it since. That was four years ago; I took only three\r\nbottles. I would recommend it to all having throat or lung trouble. I\r\nhave also used Dr. Sage's Catarrh Remedy with equally good results. I\r\nbelieve that no one need suffer long with chronic catarrh who is within\r\nreach of this remedy.\r\n\r\n    Yours respectfully,\r\n    MRS. LENA OSBORNE,\r\n    Ripley, Chautauqua Co., N.Y.\r\n\r\n\r\nNASAL CATARRH, LUNG DISEASE, INDIGESTION, ETC.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: H.A. Milne, Esq.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--Five years since my family physician pronounced my case\r\nPulmonary Consumption. Since that time I nave taken various treatments,\r\nsome of which have given relief. One treatment that was administered for\r\nnasal catarrh, from which I continued to be affected, caused erosion of\r\nthe mucous membrane, and destruction of the bony septum which separates\r\nthe two nostrils. Took cold quite easily, suffered from considerable\r\nnasal catarrh, with discharges passing posteriorly dropping into the\r\nthroat; occasional cough with some shortness of breath on exertion. A\r\ndeep inspiration caused a dizzy sensation in the head; eyesight was\r\nimpaired as well as the memory. After sitting for a time, and then\r\nquickly rising I suffered from blindness as well as a dizzy feeling in\r\nthe head. I never felt that I was entirely cured of my lung trouble,\r\nhaving many of the symptoms which are common to those in the incipient\r\nstage of consumption. I also suffered from indigestion, torpidity of the\r\nliver, and constipation of the bowels.\r\n\r\nUpon consulting at your Institution, was advised at once to begin the\r\ncourse of specially prepared medicines as indicated in my case. In all,\r\nI have only taken two months' special treatment, and it has now been six\r\nmonths since I have required any medicine; all symptoms of disease have\r\nentirely disappeared, and I desire to thank you for the interest you\r\nhave taken in my case, and the treatment prescribed. I have no objection\r\nto your publishing my testimony, if by so doing others may be induced to\r\nplace themselves under your care for treatment at your Institution, or\r\nhave medicines sent to their homes.\r\n\r\n    Respectfully yours, H.A.

PIERCE, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n_Dear Sir_--It is now eight years since I took Dr. Pierce's Golden\r\nMedical Discovery. I had a very bad cough, also night-sweats, and was\r\nalmost in my grave, as we thought, with consumption, when a friend of\r\nmine who died with consumption came to me in a dream and told me to take\r\nDr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery, and, thank the Lord, I did so. By\r\nthe time I had taken half of the first bottle I felt so much better, I\r\nkept on till I had taken three bottles, that was all I needed. I got\r\nwell and strong again.\r\n\r\n    Sincerely yours,\r\n    Clura McIntyre\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONIC NASAL CATARRH.\r\n\r\nDR. R.V.

I tried everything I was told of, and all failed to\r\ncure. I read about Dr. Pierce's remedies and thought I would try them. I\r\nused three bottles of Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery, four of Dr.\r\nSage's Catarrh Remedy, and I was relieved within two weeks. I continued\r\nthese medicines for four weeks, and am perfectly cured. I would advise\r\nany one who is troubled with catarrh to use Dr. Pierce's medicines. I am\r\nvery thankful for the remedies.\"\r\n\r\n    Yours respectfully,\r\n    MRS. M.

I\r\nhad it several years before I knew what it was, then I read Dr. Pierce's\r\ndescription of catarrh. I felt as he described. No one else had ever\r\nbeen able to tell me anything of the symptoms he described. I simply\r\nconcluded that if he could so minutely describe, he could also relieve,\r\nand I immediately placed myself under his treatment--by correspondence.\r\nIn a few months I was entirely relieved and have not suffered from it\r\nsince.\r\n\r\nAt the time I placed myself under his care I could not breathe with my\r\nmouth closed. My friends thought I could live only a few months more. I\r\nhave had no return of catarrh and enjoy good health. I believe Dr.\r\nPierce's treatment will cure any case of catarrh.\r\n\r\nNine years ago I was under Dr. Pierce's treatment (by correspondence)\r\nfor dyspepsia. After a few months' treatment I was entirely cured of\r\nthat terrible disease.\r\n\r\n    Yours respectfully,\r\n    MRS.

I commenced using Dr. Sage's Catarrh\r\nRemedy, at the same time using the \"Golden Medical Discovery\"; I used\r\none package and one bottle of \"Golden Medical Discovery\" and I found\r\ngreat relief; after using the second I thought all was right, but I\r\nbegan to feel the effects of it again, so I got the third and fourth\r\npackages, and I am satisfied I am rid of it. Since I commenced using\r\nyour medicines, I have taken six bottles of Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical\r\nDiscovery.\r\n\r\n    Yours respectfully, JOHN WEAVER,\r\n    West Carrollton,\r\n    Montgomery Co., Ohio.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONIC NASAL CATARRH CAUSES GREAT SUFFERING.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mrs. Crocker.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--I had been a great sufferer from nasal catarrh for a number\r\nof years which greatly debilitated my system, and in consequence, have\r\nbeen in poor health for the last five years.\r\n\r\nSlight exposure would cause bronchial trouble, but kept up under it\r\nuntil a little more than two years ago when I was taken with \"La\r\nGrippe,\" which greatly aggravated my other troubles; and for more than\r\nsix months before consulting you was scarcely able to do anything;\r\n_could not breathe through my nostrils_ only a little while at a time\r\neither day or night; I suffered _dreadfully_, having at times _terrible\r\npains in my head_ being unable to sleep some nights more than two hours\r\nand then not without dreaming, and when I awoke my head felt worse then\r\nwhen I retired. Had indigestion, chronic constipation and stomach\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\nA little more than a year ago, while reading in one of your Memorandum\r\nBooks I decided to try your Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery,\r\n\"Favorite Prescription\" and \"Pellets;\" and after using several bottles,\r\nI began to get better and to get some strength, but my catarrh remained\r\nabout the same until I consulted you by letter and the remedy prescribed\r\nproved effectual; after three months' treatment, I am able to do most of\r\nmy house work.\r\n\r\n    Yours respectfully, MRS.

Meise, Esq. ]\r\n\r\nIt gives me great pleasure to testify to the merits of Dr. Sage's\r\nCatarrh Remedy. I can say honestly and candidly that it is the grandest\r\nmedicine ever compounded for catarrh. I suffered terribly with that\r\ndreadful disease and thought my case a hopeless one. I have expended on\r\nmy case about forty dollars for different remedies guaranteed to cure\r\ncatarrh in its worst form, but received no benefit therefrom. I also\r\nreceived treatment from two physicians, but they did me no good. Having\r\nread a great deal about Dr. Sage's Catarrh Remedy, I concluded to try\r\nit. The first bottle gave the most pleasing results, and the second\r\nbottle completely cured my case, which I considered hopeless. I most\r\nheartily recommend Dr. Sage's Catarrh Remedy to all suffering from\r\ncatarrh, with the assurance that it will surely cure. It is a great boon\r\nto suffering humanity. Hoping that this humble testimony may be the\r\nmeans of leading many sufferers to try your most valuable medicine with\r\nthe same happy results as I experienced, and wishing you the best of\r\nsuccess, I am,\r\n\r\n    Yours sincerely, AUGUST G.

The\r\n\"Golden Medical Discovery\" caused a very unpleasant sensation to pass\r\nthrough my body at first but I do not feel it much now. I have\r\nrecommended it to others and the only complaint I hear now is that our\r\ndruggist cannot keep a supply on hand.\r\n\r\nI take pleasure in reporting my case to you, and I feel that the\r\ninterest you have taken in my case has been a blessing unto me.\r\n\r\nMy mother has suffered with bad legs for over twenty years and last fall\r\nthey got so bad she was unable to walk. She has taken \"Golden Medical\r\nDiscovery\" all winter and is now able to walk a little. She says she\r\nfeels better in body than she has for years. She has spent the most of\r\nher life among the sick and speaks very highly of your medicines.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly,\r\n    Geo A.

Tate. ]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--My health is better now than it has been in ten years. I\r\nused six bottles of \"Golden Medical Discovery,\" and three bottles Doctor\r\nSage's Catarrh Remedy, and since using your medicines I have been able\r\nto do more work than before. I have been teaching school since my health\r\ngot better and last year I was able to travel and preach fifty-nine\r\nsermons, besides my work of teaching.\r\n\r\nFor four years I suffered with catarrh in my head, and impure blood,\r\nuntil my health was very feeble. Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery I\r\nfound to be the best blood-purifier I ever used. Had I not used your\r\nremedies I believe that I would have been dead to-day, or at least not\r\nable to say anything. But instead of that I am able to walk one and\r\none-half miles and teach school every day.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly,\r\n    REV. J.H.

You put so much faith in your remedies that\r\nI concluded to try one bottle or two, and I derived much benefit\r\ntherefrom. I used up three bottles of Dr. Sage's Catarrh Remedy, five\r\nbottles of your \"Golden Medical Discovery,\" and in four months I was\r\nmyself again. I could not sleep on my left side, and now I can sleep and\r\neat heartily. So long as I have your medicines on hand I have no need of\r\na doctor; I do not think my house in order without them.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly,\r\n    A.H.

Hausner, Famous Mesmerist.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--Some ten years ago I suffered untold agony from chronic\r\nnasal catarrh. My family physician gave me up as incurable, and said I\r\nmust die. At this time I weighed 110 pounds. My case was such a bad one,\r\nthat every day, towards sunset, my voice would become so hoarse I could\r\nbarely speak above a whisper. In the morning my coughing and clearing of\r\nmy throat would almost strangle me. By the use of Dr. Sage's Catarrh\r\nRemedy in three months I was a well man; the cure has been permanent,\r\nand I now weigh 148 pounds.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly, PROF. W.

Weaver, Esq.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--I take pleasure in announcing to you that I have been\r\ngreatly benefited by your medicines; my trouble began with nasal catarrh\r\nand extended to my throat and ears; my bowels were inactive and my\r\ngeneral health became impaired; my worst trouble, however, was dullness\r\nof hearing. I had an uncomfortable, bad feeling in my ears--akin to\r\nearache; I had a watery discharge from the nose; I had to hawk and spit\r\na great deal at times; my mind was greatly affected also and had a great\r\ndeal of pain in the head. Upon advice of friends to try your medicines I\r\nresolved to do so. Have used six bottles of your \"Golden Medical\r\nDiscovery\" and two bottles of Sage's Catarrh Remedy. The pain in my head\r\nis gone and my health is greatly improved and am working every day,\r\nsomething I could not do before. My appetite is good.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly,\r\n    MORRIS C.

My throat would bleed\r\nfrom three to five times a day--half a dozen mouthfuls perhaps--as fresh\r\nas if you had cut your finger, and I was in a generally weakened state\r\nalthough able to be about the house, but the least exertion would make\r\nme tremble. Finally I purchased one of Dr. Pierce's Common Sense Medical\r\nAdvisers, and read it a good deal, and so was induced to take your\r\nmedicines. I took in all seven bottles of the \"Golden Medical\r\nDiscovery,\" one of the \"Favorite Prescription,\" and one bottle of Dr.\r\nSage's Catarrh Remedy, and some of the \"Pellets,\" and they did\r\neverything for me--more than anything else I ever tried. In about six\r\nmonths' time I was well. Now, my throat does not trouble me unless I\r\ntake cold. It has been about six years since I took your medicines, and\r\nI think they cured me.\r\n\r\nI think there are no medicines equal to your medicines, and would\r\nrecommend them to all suffering ones.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly,\r\n    Mrs. Lewis Johnson\r\n\r\n\r\nCATARRH.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: D. Miner, Esq.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--I had the catarrh in the head for about fifteen years; my\r\nhead was always stopped up and I had pains almost constantly. My nose\r\nwould run, and stuff would fall into my throat whenever I would lie\r\ndown, and at other times it seemed dry and crusty, and then my head\r\nwould become stopped up and I would suffer again.\r\n\r\nI used cubebs and glycerine for a long time; they only relieved me while\r\nI was using them. I used several other kinds of stuff, but I received no\r\nbenefit from them. I had nearly given up in despair. At last I came\r\nacross one of your advertisements of Dr. Sage's Catarrh Remedy in one of\r\nyour Memorandum Books, and I thought I would try it. It is the grandest\r\nthing on earth. I was thankful to God I found something at last to stop\r\nmy suffering. May God bless you, dear friends, for saving my life.\r\n\r\nI used your medicine about eight weeks: it only took two bottles to cure\r\nme sound and well after all the rest had failed.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly,\r\n    DAVID MINER,\r\n    Bridgeport, Marion Co., Ind.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONIC NASAL CATARRH.\r\n\r\nHALF A DOZEN BOTTLES OF DR.

I have taken five bottles of\r\nDr. Sage's Catarrh Remedy, and used it with Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical\r\nDiscovery. I have no signs of catarrh now, and can say I never felt\r\nbetter in my life, then while taking your medicine. Two years later Mr.\r\nThomas says: I nave not been troubled with catarrh since taking the\r\n\"Catarrh Remedy.\" I am a tenor singer and my voice almost left me when I\r\nhad the catarrh but now my voice has come back.

I am restored from weak eyes, weak\r\nstomach, catarrh, also female trouble. I took two bottles of Dr.\r\nPierce's Golden Medical Discovery, one bottle of Dr. Sage's Catarrh\r\nRemedy. It took wonderful effect. I have recommended your medicines a\r\ngreat deal, and have done a great deal of work for you.

Three years ago this fall I had catarrh in\r\nits worst form, till from three gills to one and one-half pints of\r\ncorruption would be expectorated in twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nThen I noticed your advertisement. Six months after taking your\r\nmedicines I thought it too soon to tell you, but I can now say that my\r\nmoney was well spent in buying your medicine, for it resulted in a\r\npermanent cure. The catarrh was of eight years' standing.\r\n\r\n    Yours respectfully,\r\n    EDWARD M. BAILEY,\r\n    Taggart, Harrison Co., Mo.\r\n\r\n\r\nDREADFUL COUGH.

Berryman, Jr.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--Seven years ago I was on the verge of the grave, with what\r\nthe physician pronounced an abscess of the right lung. It lingered on\r\nfor three years. During that time my side discharged large quantities of\r\npus and I had a dreadful cough. I was so weak that I could not walk\r\nfifty yards without being completely exhausted. I had taken every kind\r\nof medicine that was recommended for similar maladies, such as cod liver\r\noil, sarsaparillas, iron tonic and syrup of hypophosphites, without any\r\nrelief. I was about discouraged when I commenced taking Dr. Pierce's\r\nGolden Medical Discovery. I took six bottles and it completely restored\r\nme to health. The discharge stopped from my side, and the cough has\r\nceased. I am now able to follow my profession, which is a teacher of\r\npenmanship. I can walk ten miles any day without the least worry. If any\r\none doubts this statement they can write me and I will verify the above\r\nstatement.\r\n\r\nTrusting that this may be the means of assisting some one else who is\r\nsuffering untold miseries, as I did before using the \"G.M.D.\"\r\n\r\n    I am, fraternally thine,\r\n    F.

Gray, Esq.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--I was nearly deaf on the right side of my head. I used\r\nthree or four bottles of Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery and four\r\nbottles of Dr. Sage's Catarrh Remedy with the Nasal Douche, in the first\r\ntrial. Cold weather coming on I had to stop, as I could not use the\r\nInjector in freezing weather, but I was greatly benefited. Along towards\r\nspring I found it was coming back, from taking cold, and, after several\r\ntrials of other remedies, I again began the use of your medicines,\r\ntaking two bottles of the \"Golden Medical Discovery\" and three bottles\r\nof Dr. Sage's Catarrh Remedy, and I feel safe in believing I am cured as\r\nI feel no signs of its return. My health is very good for a man of 74\r\nyears of age and I am satisfied that Dr. Pierce's Medicines did it. I\r\nrecommend them whenever I have a chance.\r\n\r\n    Yours respectfully,\r\n    S.P.

When,\r\nsometime ago, I consulted you in regard to my affliction, bronchitis, I\r\nwas indeed fearing the worst. But I had so much confidence in your\r\nmedicines, which I had previously used for colds and liver complaint\r\nwith good results, that I strictly followed your kind advice and\r\ncontinued taking it until I was assured of perfect health. I took five\r\nbottles of your Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery, using the\r\n\"Pellets\" combined as directed, and _the effect was magical_. I am now\r\nhealthy and hearty.

I at\r\nlast became alarmed, and wrote to Dr. R.V. Pierce to know if he could\r\nprepare a medicine that would cure me, and I was advised to try his\r\n\"Golden Medical Discovery,\" which I did, and am glad to say that only\r\ntwo bottles cured me after letting the cough run on from the winter of\r\n1889 until the spring of 1893.\r\n\r\n    Yours respectfully,\r\n    MORGAN.

I was considered near my grave by many of my friends when I\r\ncommenced treatment.\r\n\r\nI used eight months' special treatment, after while I used some 12 or 15\r\nbottles of your Sage's Catarrh Remedy, and have had excellent health\r\never since.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly,\r\n    B.P.

Williams, Esq.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--For several years I was troubled with catarrh and deafness\r\nof the right ear--the hearing becoming more and more defective until I\r\ncould scarcely hear at all. There was a constant ringing, roaring noise\r\nin my ear, and finally the disease assumed a very painful form.\r\n\r\nThe ear became very sensitive to the touch, and the pain and\r\ninflammation extended into the eustachian tube and down into the throat.\r\nI could scarcely sleep at night, and during the day I suffered\r\nconstantly.\r\n\r\nI finally decided to consult Dr. Pierce, and acting under his advice, I\r\nbegan the use of \"Golden Medical Discovery\" and Sage's Catarrh Remedy by\r\nmeans of Dr. Pierce's Nasal Douche.\r\n\r\nI soon began to improve and after using three bottles each of the above\r\nnamed remedies the pain and soreness left my ear, my hearing returned\r\nand I considered myself completely cured, and indeed there has been no\r\nrecurrence of the trouble since.\r\n\r\n    Sincerely yours, T.J.

After using the special\r\nmedicines which he prepared for me for a few days I commenced to feel\r\nbetter, the shortness of breath gradually disappearing; the paroxysms of\r\nasthma were less frequent and not so severe.\r\n\r\nAfter taking only two months' treatment I was completely restored to my\r\nprevious good health, and for five months it has not been necessary for\r\nme to use any medicine, and I feel that I am perfectly well. I give you\r\nthis testimonial in order that others who are similarly afflicted may\r\nknow of your skill in treating cases of this nature, and seek relief\r\nfrom your Institution.\r\n\r\n    Respectfully,\r\n    GOTTLIEB BERNER,\r\n    Cheektowaga, Erie Co., N.Y.\r\n\r\n\r\nASTHMA COMPLICATED WITH BRONCHITIS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: T.E.

The Invalids' Hotel is a place as much like home as it is\r\npossible for such an institution to be.

At times I could not even\r\nwalk across the room, without pains in my chest. The doctor who attended\r\nme said I had lung-trouble and that I would never be well again. At last\r\nI concluded to try Dr. Pierce's medicines. I bought a bottle of \"Golden\r\nMedical Discovery,\" took it and soon commenced to feel a little better,\r\nthen you directed me to take both the \"Golden Medical Discovery\" and the\r\n\"Favorite Prescription,\" which I did. Altogether I have taken eighteen\r\nbottles of \"Golden Medical Discovery,\" twelve of the \"Favorite\r\nPrescription\" and five vials of \"Pellets.\" I am now almost entirely well\r\nand do all my work without any pain whatever, and can _run_ with more\r\nease than I could formerly _walk_.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly,\r\n    MRS. CORA L. SUNDERLAND,\r\n    Chaneyville, Calvert Co., Md.\r\n\r\n\r\nASTHMA, OR PHTHISIC.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mrs. Owen.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--For six or seven years I have been a great sufferer from\r\nasthma, being for weeks so I had to sit in my chair night and day; and\r\nto all people suffering with the disease, I am glad to recommend your\r\nmedicines of which I have taken only a few bottles. I now call myself\r\ncured, for I have not had asthma for a long time.\r\n\r\n    Yours respectfully,\r\n    MRS. EMILY OWEN,\r\n    Hinsdale, Cheshire Co., N.H.\r\n\r\n\r\nNERVOUS PROSTRATION FOLLOWING GRIP.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: W.S. Nicholson, Esq.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--In January of '90 took the \"grippe,\" went to work before I\r\nwas well, was caught in a rain which gave me a very bad relapse,\r\nresulting in lung fever and complete prostration; was on my bed two\r\nmonths, and when I did get out, the strength to walk any more than just\r\na few rods did not come back. My family doctor and two prominent\r\nphysicians of Sioux City, did me no good. Late in the fall I got a\r\nbottle of Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery, which quieted my\r\ntrembling nerves and gave me an appetite to eat. I then concluded to try\r\nthe Doctor, personally. Up to this time I was in a pitiable condition.\r\nSometimes I could not sleep until I felt almost wild, then sleep so much\r\nI would be stupefied. I could not digest any food and my whole system\r\nwas wasting and failing fast. I doubt if any one who saw me expected me\r\nto get well. I took the treatment sent me by the World's Dispensary\r\nMedical Association for more than a year. The medicine never gave me any\r\ndistress as other medicines had done before. I began to improve from the\r\nstart, but the change from one extreme to the other was like the growth\r\nof a child.\r\n\r\nTo any one suffering from nervous prostration I would say, \"don't be\r\nimpatient.\" It takes a long time for weakened nerves to grow strong. I\r\nhave at last become strong and well, thanks to the Giver of all good and\r\nthe grand Institution at Buffalo. I nave since married a noble-hearted\r\nyoung woman, and when I am playing with our sweet, healthy, baby girl, I\r\ngive way to the thought that at last the long, Bad chapter of my life is\r\nended; at such times her merry laugh sounds like a song of triumph of\r\nlife over death.\r\n\r\n    Gratefully yours,\r\n    W.S. NICHOLSON,\r\n    Willow Creek, Clay Co., Iowa.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE HEART.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiseases of the heart are classified as either _functional_ or _organic_\r\nWe shall dwell only briefly upon purely _functional_ derangements of the\r\nheart; as _increased_, or excited action, _defective_, or enfeebled\r\naction, and _irregular_ action.\r\n\r\nIncreased action of the heart, indicated by palpitation, or increased\r\nnumber of the beats, may be caused _mechanically_, as by distention of\r\nthe stomach, which, by preventing the descent of the diaphragm, excites\r\nthe action of this organ. Or it may be a _sympathetic_ disturbance\r\nproduced through the nervous system; thus the emotions and passions may\r\nsuddenly arouse the heart to excessive action; or the presence of worms\r\nin the intestines, improper food, and masturbation, may be the cause.\r\nThe use of tea, tobacco, and alcoholic drinks excites the heart. We have\r\nfound that the excessive use of tobacco is very frequently the cause of\r\nfunctional derangement of this organ. Deficiency of the blood, as in\r\nanæmia, may be the cause of palpitation of the heart.\r\n\r\nFunctional disturbance of the heart's action is manifested by\r\npalpitation, irregularity, intermissions, a rolling or tumbling\r\nmovement, and a feeling as if the heart were in the throat. These\r\nsymptoms often give rise to great apprehension, anxiety, fear, and\r\ndepression of mind.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. The curative treatment of functional derangement of the heart\r\nmust have reference to the causes producing it. If it is in consequence\r\nof indigestion, the appetite and digestion should be improved by\r\nobserving regularity in the time of taking the meals, and eating very\r\neasily-digested food. The use of strong tea, coffee, tobacco, and\r\nspirits, should be interdicted, and regular exercise, rest, and sleep\r\nshould be enjoined.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, the domestic management should include daily bathing,\r\nexercise in the open air, regular habits, and the avoidance of all\r\ncauses which tend to excite the heart's irregularity.\r\n\r\n_The remedial treatment_ of these functional affections ought to be\r\nconfided to some experienced physician, as the remedies are not within\r\nthe ordinary reach of all families, nor if they were, would they have\r\nsufficient experience and knowledge to select and properly administer\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\nORGANIC DISEASE OF THE HEART.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy organic disease we mean disease pertaining to the structure of the\r\nheart itself, in contradistinction to _functional_ disease, which has\r\nreference merely to the _action_ of the heart. The heart is subject to\r\nvarious organic diseases, but we have only space to consider, in the\r\nbriefest manner, those which are the most common. It is essential that\r\nthe reader should have some knowledge of the anatomy and functions of\r\nthe various parts of the heart in order that its diseases and their\r\neffects may be comprehended; therefore the anatomy and physiology of\r\nthis organ, given in Part I, Chapter VII, of this work, should be\r\ncarefully studied.\r\n\r\nIt is very evident that any disease which affects the structure and\r\nfunction of any part of the heart must, necessarily, give rise to\r\ncertain modifications of the pulse, sounds, etc. It is through the\r\nobservation and study of these modifications and changes that we arrive\r\nat a correct diagnosis as to the precise location and character of the\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.\r\nPond's Sphygmograph.]\r\n\r\nUntil within comparatively recent years, physicians were very much in\r\nthe dark regarding diseases of the heart. Now, however, with a thorough\r\nknowledge of the anatomy, physiology, and pathology of the heart and the\r\nparts surrounding it, and with the aid of instruments which modern\r\ningenuity has given us, we are able to diagnosticate with precision the\r\nslightest lesions of any part of this important organ, and, knowing\r\ntheir nature, to map out an appropriate course of treatment. With the\r\naid of the stethoscope, invented by Laennec and improved upon by Camman,\r\nwe are able to distinguish the slightest deviation from the normal\r\nsounds, and, by noting the character of the sound, the time when it\r\noccurs, the area over which It is heard most distinctly, and the\r\ndirection in which it is transmitted, to locate the lesion which\r\nproduces it. By the aid of the sphygmograph, first invented by\r\nHerrisson, and afterward improved upon by Ludwig, Vierordt, Marey, and\r\nlastly by Pond, of our own country, the pulsations at the wrist are\r\nregistered, and thus made perceptible to the eye.\r\n\r\nWe herewith give a cut, Fig. 1, of Pond's instrument, and two tracings\r\nmade by it. The first is a healthy tracing, and the second indicates\r\nenlargement, technically called hypertrophy, of the heart\r\n\r\nPERICARDITIS, or inflammation of the membranous sac which surrounds the\r\nheart, may be either acute or chronic. The symptoms in acute\r\npericarditis are made up from co-existing affections, and are frequently\r\nassociated with articular rheumatism, Bright's disease of the kidneys,\r\nor pleuritis The intensity of the pain varies in different individuals.\r\nThe action of the heart is increased, the pulse is quick, and vomiting\r\nsometimes takes place. When this disease is developed in the course of\r\nrheumatism, it is known as rheumatic pericarditis, and is almost always\r\nassociated with endocarditis. In some cases acute pericarditis is very\r\ndistressing, in others it is mild. The fatality is not due so much to\r\nthe disease itself, as to co-existing affections. When it does not prove\r\nfatal, it sometimes becomes chronic.\r\n\r\nIn chronic pericarditis, pain is seldom present. The heart is generally\r\nmore or less enlarged, its sounds are feeble, the first being weaker\r\nthan the second.\r\n\r\nENDOCARDITIS, or inflammation of the membrane lining the cavities of the\r\nheart, is one of the most frequent forms of heart disease. It is almost\r\ninvariably associated with acute rheumatism, or some of the eruptive\r\nfevers, as small-pox, scarlet fever, etc., and is due to the irritation\r\nof the unhealthy blood passing through the heart. The disease is\r\ngenerally attended with little or no pain, and, consequently, if the\r\nattending physician be not on the alert, it will escape his observation.\r\nWhen associated with acute rheumatism, the disease is only in rare\r\ninstances directly fatal, but in the great majority of cases it leaves\r\npermanent organic changes, which sooner or later develop into valvular\r\naffections, and these may eventually destroy life. When the disease\r\noccurs, however, as the result of pyæmia (blood-poisoning produced by\r\nthe absorption of decomposing pus or \"matter\") or of diphtheria, or when\r\nit is associated with any other septic conditions, it constitutes a very\r\ngrave element. Collections of matter formed on the membrane lining the\r\nheart and covering its valves, are liable to be detached and carried by\r\nthe circulation to the brain, spleen, or liver, where they plug up some\r\nartery, and thus cause death of the parts which it supplies with blood.\r\n\r\nChronic endocarditis generally occurs in rheumatic subjects,\r\nunassociated with any acute disease, It may exist without any marked\r\nsymptoms, except, perhaps, a sense of oppression and uneasiness in the\r\nchest, with palpitation. It produces a thickening and hardening of the\r\nmembrane lining the heart, and generally causes a retraction, adhesion,\r\nand degeneration of some of the valves of the heart, thus bringing on\r\nvalvular disease.\r\n\r\nVALVULAR LESIONS are, as we have seen, very frequently the result of\r\nendocarditis. They are of two kinds. First, those which prevent the\r\nvalves from flapping back close to the walls of the ventricles, or\r\narteries, thus diminishing, to a greater or lesser extent, the size of\r\nthe valvular orifices, and offering an obstruction to the free flow of\r\nblood through them; and which consist of a thickening and retraction, or\r\nadhesion of the valves, chalky deposits, morbid growths, etc. Secondly,\r\nthose which prevent complete closure of the valves, and thus permit a\r\nreturn of the blood into the cavity from which it has just been\r\nexpelled. These latter consist of retractions, perforations, and partial\r\ndetachments of the valves, chalky deposits around the base of the valves\r\nand in them, and rupture of the chordæ tendineæ.\r\n\r\nThese two forms of lesions are usually co-existent, one generally being\r\nmore extensive than the other. Thus, the regurgitation may be slight,\r\nand the obstruction great, or _vice versa_. The symptoms and disturbance\r\nof the circulation are altogether dependent upon the location and form\r\nof the lesion, or lesions. Each valvular lesion has its characteristic\r\nsound, or murmur, which is heard at a particular period in the cycle of\r\nthe heart's action, and it is, as before stated, from these sounds, from\r\ntracings of the pulse, and from the many other indications, that we\r\narrive at a diagnosis. Thus, in obstruction of the orifice at the\r\njunction of the aorta with the left ventricle, one of the most frequent\r\nof valvular lesions, a murmur, generally harsh in character, is heard\r\nwith the first sound of the heart, with greatest intensity directly over\r\nthe normal position or the aortic semilunar valves. This is conveyed\r\nalong the large arteries, and may be heard, less distinctly, over the\r\ncarotids. In the sphygmographic tracing, the line of ascent is less\r\nabrupt than in the normal tracing (Fig. 2), and not nearly so high, and\r\nit is rounded at the top. In aortic regurgitation, the line of ascent is\r\nsimilar to that of the healthy tracing, but the line of descent is very\r\nsudden. The left side of the heart is almost invariably the primary seat\r\nof these affections, but in the latter stages of their course, the right\r\nside also is liable to become involved, and, as a consequence, there\r\nthen exists great disturbance of the venous circulation, with a damming\r\nback of the blood in the veins, and passive congestion of the liver,\r\nkidneys and brain, followed by dropsy, albumen in the urine, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.\r\nThe above is a representation of a tracing of a healthy\r\npulse as made with the Sphygmograph.]\r\n\r\nHYPERTROPHY OF THE HEART consists of a thickening of the muscular walls\r\nof this organ. It may be confined to one portion of the heart, or it may\r\naffect the entire organ. The affection has been divided into the\r\nfollowing three forms: _Simple hypertrophy_, in which there is an\r\nincrease in the thickness of the walls of the heart, without any\r\naugmentation in the capacity of the cavities, and which is usually the\r\nresult of chronic Bright's disease, or great intemperance; _eccentric\r\nhypertrophy_, in which there is an increase in the thickness of the\r\nwalls of the heart, together with increase in the capacity of the\r\ncavities, and which is generally the result of some valvular lesion; and\r\n_concentric hypertrophy_, in which there is an increase in the thickness\r\nof the walls of the heart, with a decrease in the capacity of the\r\ncavities. Valvular lesions, obstructions in the large arteries, or, in\r\nfact, any thing which calls upon the heart to constantly perform an\r\nundue amount of labor must, necessarily, produce hypertrophy of its\r\nmuscular walls, just as the undue amount of labor which the blacksmith's\r\narm is called upon to perform produces hypertrophy of its muscles. With\r\nthis condition, the pulse is hard and incompressible, and the line of\r\nascent in the sphygmographic tracing (Fig. 3) is higher than in health.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.]\r\n\r\nDILATATION OF THE HEART is a condition which is closely allied to\r\nhypertrophy of the heart, and which consists of an increase in the\r\ncapacity of the cavities of the heart, with diminished contractile\r\npower. In simple dilatation, there is an increase in the capacities of\r\nthe cavities, without any marked change in the walls of the organ. It is\r\nusually the result of some disease which has produced great muscular\r\nprostration, and which has interfered materially with nutrition. More\r\nfrequently, however, dilatation is the result of valvular lesions, and\r\nis associated with hypertrophy, there being an increase in the thickness\r\nof the walls with a diminution of the contractile power. The hypertrophy\r\nfrom valvular lesions goes on increasing until it reaches a certain\r\nstage, when dilatation commences, the two conditions then being\r\nassociated.\r\n\r\nATROPHY of the heart is the opposite to hypertrophy, and signifies a\r\nwasting away of the muscular substance, and a diminution in the\r\nthickness of the walls of the heart. Its power is diminished in\r\nproportion to the degree of atrophy.\r\n\r\nFATTY DEGENERATION of the heart consists in the deposition of particles\r\nof fat within the _sarcolemma_ (the sheath which invests the fibrils),\r\nwhich are substituted for the proper muscular tissue. If the fatty\r\ndegeneration exists to any extent the muscular walls present a yellowish\r\ncolor, and the heart is soft and flabby. This may be confined to one\r\nventricle, or it may affect the inner layer of fibres, the outer layer\r\nremaining unchanged. Degeneration of the left ventricle occasions\r\nfeebleness of the pulse. Difficulty in breathing is one symptom of this\r\ndisease, especially when the right ventricle is affected. There is\r\npallor, feeble circulation, cold extremities, and frequently dropsy.\r\nFatty degeneration is more liable to occur in corpulent persons, and\r\nbetween the ages of forty and fifty years.\r\n\r\nANGINA PECTORIS, also termed _neuralgia of the heart_, might be included\r\namong the diseases of the nervous system, but as it is usually\r\nassociated with a derangement in the action of the heart, it may be\r\nproperly considered in this connection. The pain varies in intensity,\r\nsometimes being very acute, at others assuming a milder form. The action\r\nof the heart is more or less disturbed. The beats are irregular, at\r\ntimes being strong, while again they are feeble. A feeling of numbness\r\nis experienced in those parts to which the pain penetrates. These\r\nparoxysms _usually_ continue but a few minutes, although they sometimes\r\nlast several hours. Persons suffering from angina pectoris are liable to\r\nsudden death. It is connected with ossification, or other organic\r\nchanges of the heart. Usually these paroxysms, if the life of the\r\npatient continues, become more and more frequent. The danger is not to\r\nbe measured by the intensity of the pain, but by the co-existing organic\r\ndisease. Although it is not absolutely certain that organic disease is\r\npresent in all cases of angina pectoris, yet the exceptions are so rare\r\nthat when the signs of organic disease cannot be detected, it may be\r\ninferred that angina is not the real affection, or that the existing\r\nlesions escape observation. Those who suffer from this disease are, in\r\nthe great majority of cases, of the male sex, and rarely under the age\r\nof forty.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. In the foregoing consideration of organic diseases of the\r\nheart, we have omitted to speak of their remedial management, for the\r\nobvious reason that unprofessional readers are unable to correctly\r\ndistinguish between the various diseases of this vital organ; and it\r\nwould, therefore, be useless for us to attempt to instruct them as to\r\nthe medicinal treatment of the different cardiac affections.\r\n\r\nIn the vast majority of instances, diseases of the heart are not\r\nnecessarily speedily fatal. Persons have been known to live twenty years\r\nor more with very extensive organic disease of this organ.\r\n\r\nIt is _very important_, however, that a correct diagnosis be made in the\r\nearly stages of these diseases, in order that an appropriate course of\r\nhygiene and treatment may be adopted, which will check their progress.\r\nWhile we cannot cure extensive organic diseases of the heart, we _can_\r\ncheck their progress, and prolong life, and render the condition of the\r\nsubject comparatively comfortable. Since we are able to diagnosticate\r\nwith the utmost precision the various affections of the heart, and since\r\nthe discovery of certain specific medicines which exert most beneficial\r\neffects, we are enabled to treat this class of maladies with the most\r\ngratifying results. Thus we have seen a case in a very advanced stage of\r\nthe disease, with the breathing so difficult that the subject had been\r\ncompelled to remain almost constantly in the sitting posture, in the\r\ngreatest agony, for so long a time that immense bed sores had formed on\r\nthe seat; in which the dropsy had become so extensive that the skin of\r\nthe legs had burst open; and yet this patient, through the influence of\r\na specific course of treatment, was speedily relieved, and enabled to\r\nlive in a comparatively comfortable condition for many months.\r\n\r\nOne afflicted with heart disease should abstain from the use of all\r\nkinds of stimulants, tobacco, and whatever tends to lower vitality. His\r\nlife should be an even one, free from all excitement of any kind\r\nwhatsoever. He should avoid severe physical exertion, and everything\r\nwhich causes the heart to beat with undue frequency.\r\n\r\nThere are certain symptoms, the result of _chlorosis_ (the green\r\nsickness), a deficiency of blood, dyspepsia, uterine disease, and\r\ncertain nervous affections, which may simulate those of real organic\r\ndisease, but the physician of education and experience, with a trained\r\near, is able to detect the difference speedily.\r\n\r\n\r\nSORE MOUTH. (STOMATITIS.)\r\n\r\n\r\nStomatitis, or inflammation of the mucous membrane of the mouth, may\r\ninclude the entire surface of the gums, tongue, and cheeks, or appear\r\nonly in spots. Vesicles are formed, having swollen edges and a white or\r\nyellow center, which finally ulcerate. When mild, the affection is\r\nconfined to these parts.\r\n\r\nIf the inflammation is acute, the mouth is dry and parched, or as is\r\nmore frequently the case, the flow of saliva is abundant and acrid, and,\r\nwhen swallowed, irritates the stomach and bowels, producing fever,\r\ndiarrhea, griping pains, and flatulency. The tongue is either coated\r\nwhite or red, and is glossy, and the sense of taste is considerably\r\nimpaired. Digestion and nutrition are then disturbed, and the patient\r\nbecomes rapidly emaciated.\r\n\r\nTHRUSH, OR CANKER, is that form of stomatitis in which white ulcers\r\nlocate on the inner side of the upper lip, the tongue, or roof of the\r\nmouth; the irritation which they cause not only interferes with eating,\r\nbut produces fever, together with the symptoms previously mentioned.\r\n\r\nAPTHÆ, or follicular inflammation, is distinguished by very painful\r\nlittle ulcers, single or in clusters, scattered over the surface of the\r\ntongue and lining of the mouth. Sometimes it is complicated with little\r\nlumps in the tongue. These form ulcers and denote scrofulous\r\ninflammation. Fissures and cracks in the tongue indicate derangement of\r\nthe stomach.\r\n\r\nTHE CAUSES of stomatitis, in nursing infants, are unhealthy milk, or\r\neffete matter, which, for lack of proper care and cleanliness,\r\naccumulates upon the nipple. In older children, improper diet,\r\nirritants, debility of the digestive functions, or hereditary syphilitic\r\ntaint, disorder the blood and induce local inflammation.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. Locally, use a wash of golden seal or gold thread sweetened\r\nwith maple-sugar, and rendered slightly alkaline with borax or\r\nsaleratus. Also use a very weak, alkaline tea, or one of slippery-elm\r\nflour, to obviate the acridity of the secretions. If the sores do not\r\nheal, constitutional treatment may be required, as the use of the Golden\r\nMedical Discovery. The family physician should be consulted if the sore\r\nmouth resists all these remedial measures.\r\n\r\n\r\nNURSING SORE MOUTH. (STOMATITIS MATERNA.)\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the period of nursing, and sometimes in the latter months of\r\npregnancy, women are liable to a peculiar variety of sore mouth. The\r\nsoreness is sometimes so great that, although the appetite may be\r\nravenous, the patient cannot eat. When this condition extends to the\r\nstomach and bowels, symptoms of a very grave character appear, and the\r\ndisease, by interfering with the process of nutrition, causes emaciation\r\nand debility, and in extreme cases, death. It is a strange affection,\r\nnearly always disappearing upon weaning the child, though this course is\r\nnot absolutely necessary. It appears to depend upon a hepatic, or\r\ngastric derangement, in connection with a vitiated condition of the\r\nblood, but how this is brought about is unknown.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS. The disease sometimes comes on suddenly, at others more\r\nslowly. The fact that the woman is either pregnant or nursing, is of\r\nimportance in forming a diagnosis. At first there is a severe, scalding\r\nsensation of the tongue, mouth, and fauces, with pain, which is\r\nsometimes intense. The color of the tongue is often pink, or a light\r\nred, while the mouth is generally of a deeper hue. This stinging, biting\r\nsensation is accompanied by a profuse, watery discharge from the mouth,\r\nwhich seems extremely hot and acrid, causing excoriation whenever it\r\ncomes in contract with the face or chin. The appetite is good, sometimes\r\nravenous, but food or drinks, except of the blandest character, occasion\r\nsuch intense pain that the patient avoids their use. Ulceration occurs\r\nafter a little time. The bowels are generally constipated, but when the\r\ndisease extends to the stomach or intestines, diarrhea occurs. There is\r\ngenerally anæmia, debility, and impairment of the vital powers.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. The indications for treatment in this affection are to\r\novercome the vitiated condition of the blood, and to sustain the vital\r\npowers. The remedies for this purpose are alteratives, antiseptics, and\r\ntonics. Give the Golden Medical Discovery, the value of which may be\r\ngreatly enhanced by adding one-half ounce of the fluid extract of\r\nbaptisia to each bottle, in doses of a teaspoonful four times a day.\r\nChlorate of potash, half an ounce in a pint of water, used as a wash and\r\ngargle, is of great value. A teaspoonful of the same may be swallowed\r\nseveral times a day. This will not interfere with other medicines. As a\r\ntonic, the tincture of the muriate of iron, in five to ten-drop doses,\r\ndiluted with water, may be taken three or four times daily. Quinine, in\r\none or two-gram doses, should be given with the iron if the debility be\r\nextreme. When there is great acidity of the stomach, which may be known\r\nby heart burn, saleratus may be taken in water, to neutralize it, but\r\nshould not be drunk within an hour of the time for taking other\r\nmedicines. If constipation exists, use the Pleasant Pellets. This course\r\nof treatment, thoroughly carried out, will seldom fail to effect a\r\nperfect cure, without weaning the child, yet this latter course may\r\nsometimes become advisable to promote the recovery of the patient.\r\nShould the treatment advised not produce the desired result, a skillful\r\nphysician's services should be secured, as he may, in individual cases,\r\ndistinguish other important indications which may enable him to modify\r\nthe treatment to advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIARRHEA, CHOLERA INFANTUM, OR SUMMER COMPLAINT, AND DYSENTERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese diseases are usually considered separately by medical writers but,\r\nas they are closely related, a simple diarrhea not unfrequently running\r\ninto a _cholera infantum_ or a dysentery, we shall consider them\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nDIARRHEA is an affection characterized by unnaturally frequent\r\nevacuations from the bowels of a liquid of morbidly soft consistency. It\r\nmay be simple or inflammatory, and acute or chronic.\r\n\r\nA diarrhea is said to be bilious when the discharges are composed\r\nprincipally of serum, highly colored with yellow or green bile;\r\ncatarrhal, when they are of a semi-transparent, mucous character;\r\nserous, when the dejections are thin and watery, sometimes mixed with\r\nblood, bile, or ingesta.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of the affection are usually at first those of indigestion,\r\na fullness of the stomach, flatulency, and colicky pains. The pains,\r\nwhich precede each evacuation, are intermittent in character. There may\r\nbe an unpleasant sinking sensation in the abdomen, and, with the\r\ndischarge, exhaustion, a feeble pulse, and a cool skin. In the\r\ninflammatory variety, there is more or less fever.\r\n\r\nCHOLERA INFANTUM, or summer complaint, is a disease peculiar to the warm\r\nseason, and more prevalent in cities, and among those children who do\r\nnot nurse at the breast. It is characterized by great irritability of\r\nthe stomach, and persistent vomiting and purging, the discharges from\r\nthe bowels being copious and watery, and sometimes containing specks of\r\ncurd, yellowish-green matter, and mucus. The limbs of the little\r\nsufferer are usually drawn up, indicating pain in the bowels, and there\r\nis great prostration with cold extremities. The invasion may be so\r\nsudden, and the disease so violent as to destroy life in a few hours.\r\n\r\nDYSENTERY, also known as _bloody-flux,_ consists of an inflammation of\r\nthe mucous membrane of the large intestine, with ulceration of the\r\naffected surfaces. The disease is accompanied with much nervous\r\nprostration, and is distinguished by severe pains in the abdomen of a\r\ngriping nature, followed by frequent scanty and bloody stools, and much\r\nstraining. Occasionally the attack is ushered in with a chill and aching\r\npains in various parts of the body, with copious fecal dejections. In\r\nother cases the attack is preceded by loss of appetite, a sense of\r\nuneasiness with dull pains in the abdomen, and weariness. The disease,\r\nlike diarrhea, may be either acute or chronic.\r\n\r\nTHE CAUSES of these affections of the bowels are many and varied. They\r\nmay be brought on by exposure to cold and wet, or by improper and\r\nindigestible articles of food, such as unripe fruits, salads, pastries,\r\nand, in fact, anything which interferes with the normal operations of\r\nthe digestive apparatus. One of the most fertile sources of diarrhea in\r\ninfants, and of _cholera infantum_, is the administration of unsuitable\r\nfood, the ill effects of which are greatly increased by exposure to heat\r\nor cold. Uncleanliness, and the inhalation of impure air, are prolific\r\ncauses Of these diseases. Epidemics have been supposed to be due to some\r\npeculiarity in the condition of the atmosphere, or to some impalpable\r\ngerm of a vegetable or animal nature.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. In the treatment of these diseases, one should first endeavor\r\nto ascertain the cause of the trouble, and then, if possible, effect its\r\nremoval. Attention should be given to the hygienic surroundings of the\r\nindividual afflicted; if he reside in a miasmatic district, or in a\r\nlocation in which the atmosphere is contaminated by the decomposition of\r\nanimal or vegetable matter, or filled with noxious gases, his abode\r\nshould be changed. A pure, dry air is most beneficial in these cases.\r\n\r\nOnly the least irritating and most easily digestible articles of food\r\nshould be taken. Healthy cow's milk is slightly alkaline, but that of\r\ncows fed on slops is usually acid, and unfit for infants. It is,\r\ntherefore, well to test all milk with blue litmus paper before feeding\r\nit to young children. If found to be strongly acid, that is if it turns\r\nthe paper red, it should be rejected, but if only slightly so,\r\nsufficient lime water may be added to render it slightly alkaline. For\r\nadults and older children, the diet should consist of such starchy foods\r\nas arrow-root, sago, corn starch, and rice, and of ripe grapes, freed\r\nfrom the skins and seeds, peaches, and boiled milk, or milk and lime\r\nwater. In some cases the animal broths are beneficial, especially mutton\r\nbroth. To quench the thirst, crust coffee, rice coffee, and lemonade, in\r\nsmall quantities, may be taken.\r\n\r\nRest is important in these diseases. In severe cases, the patient should\r\nbe kept in bed.\r\n\r\nAt the onset of an attack of diarrhea or dysentery, if there be reason\r\nto believe that the intestinal tract contains irritating matter, a dose\r\nof castor oil, with a few drops of anise oil added to render it\r\npalatable, should be administered. After all irritating ingesta have\r\nbeen removed, Dr. Pierce's Compound Extract of Smart-weed should be\r\ngiven in doses proportionate to the age of the patient, and the severity\r\nof the case. Being composed of the extract of smart-weed, or water\r\npepper, Jamaica ginger, camphor, and genuine French grape brandy, it\r\nexerts a most wonderful effect not only in those diseases but in cholera\r\nmorbus and intestinal colic. It allays the irritation and inflammation\r\nof the affected mucous surfaces, and soothes the nervous system. In the\r\ngreat majority of cases, the above course of treatment will be found\r\nsufficient, but in the more severe forms of these diseases additional\r\nremedies may be required.\r\n\r\nIn dysentery, accompanied with severe pain and straining, injections of\r\nstarch water and laudanum, from two to four ounces of the former to from\r\ntwenty to fifty drops of the latter should be used.\r\n\r\nHot fomentations applied to the abdomen are beneficial. If the\r\ndischarges contain much blood, a flannel cloth moistened with the\r\nspirits of turpentine should be laid over the lower part of the abdomen,\r\nand kept there until slight irritation is produced.\r\n\r\nLime water, bicarbonate of soda, bicarbonate of potash (saleratus),\r\nchalk, and the subnitrate of bismuth are valuable agents to correct the\r\nsecretions, and allay irritation of the diseased mucous surface. The\r\nabove-named preparations of soda, potash, and bismuth may be taken in\r\ndoses of from five to twenty grains every few hours.\r\n\r\nBlackberry root and cranesbill (_Geranium Maculatum_), in the form of\r\nfluid extract or infusion, are beneficial in acute cases in which the\r\ndischarges are profuse and watery, and in the chronic forms of these\r\naffections.\r\n\r\nIn _cholera infantum_ subnitrate of bismuth should be given in doses of\r\nfrom five to ten grains at intervals of from two to four hours. If the\r\ndischarges are very profuse, the fluid extract of cranesbill may be\r\nadministered in from two to ten-drop doses alternately with the bismuth.\r\nThe camphorated tincture of opium (paregoric) is required in doses of\r\nfrom two to twenty drops, depending upon the age of the child and the\r\nseverity of the case, if there is much pain, but great caution should be\r\nexercised in administering the preparations of opium to children. A\r\nsingle drop of laudanum given to a young infant has caused convulsions,\r\ncoma, and death in more than one instance. To check the vomiting of\r\n_cholera infantum_, mild irritation over the stomach is sometimes\r\neffectual. For this purpose a weak mustard plaster, or a cloth moistened\r\nwith turpentine, may be laid over the stomach for a few minutes at a\r\ntime. If the child is old enough to suck pellets of ice, these are\r\nbeneficial, or a piece can be wrapped in a cloth and sucked.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLIC.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Colic_ is a term applied to griping pains in the abdomen, which are\r\nsometimes accompanied with nausea and vomiting. The derangement is\r\nrecognized in several forms, some of which we shall briefly describe.\r\n\r\nBILIOUS COLIC. This may be the result of a morbid condition of the\r\nliver.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS. It is characterized by severe pain occurring in paroxysms,\r\nwhich may be relieved by pressure upon the bowels. The pulse is quick,\r\nthe tongue coated, and the skin harsh and dry; there is headache,\r\nimpaired appetite, acrid taste in the mouth, thirst, nausea, attended\r\nwith vomiting and general chilliness, followed by febrile symptoms.\r\n\r\nCAUSE. It may be induced by exposure to cold, in consequence of which\r\nthe circulation is impeded, the pores of the skin obstructed, and all of\r\nthe vitiated matters having to be expelled through the liver, stomach,\r\nand intestines. It may also be due to malaria in the atmosphere. It most\r\ncommonly occurs during the autumn, after a season of hot weather.\r\n\r\nFLATULENT COLIC. Flatulent or \"wind\" colic is one of the results of\r\nindigestion.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS. A sense of fullness in the pit of the stomach, attended with\r\npain, which is transferred from one part of the bowels to another. There\r\nis fever, a quick pulse, nausea, and the presence of gas; by the latter\r\nfeature it may be detected from the other forms.\r\n\r\nCAUSES. Cold or atmospheric changes, the eating of unripe fruits,\r\nuncooked vegetables and those articles of diet which ferment easily, are\r\nthe principle causes.\r\n\r\nPAINTER'S COLIC. This form is also known by various names, such as\r\n_colica pictonum, saturnine_, or _lead colic_. Those persons who are\r\nengaged in the manufacture of lead, and painters, are the most frequent\r\nvictims of this affection.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS. Impaired appetite, fetid breath, thickly coated tongue,\r\nobstinate constipation, a dry skin, scanty urine, languor, severe pain\r\nin the umbilical region, and general derangement of the functions of the\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nCAUSES. From the term applied to this form, the cause may be inferred.\r\nIt is induced by the absorption of lead through the lungs, stomach, and\r\nskin.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. The indication to be fulfilled in _bilious_ colic is to\r\nrelieve the intestinal spasm. This may be done by drinking freely of a\r\ndecoction of yam-root, or _dioscorea villosa_, which is an effectual\r\nremedy in this affection. If this be not at hand, the spasm may be\r\nrelieved by administering freely of Dr. Pierce's Extract of Smart-Weed.\r\nIf the stomach be irritable, a tablespoonful of laudanum and one of\r\ntincture of lobelia, in four ounces of starch water, administered as an\r\ninjection, is effectual. If simple means do not promptly arrest the\r\nattack, no time should be lost in summoning the family physician.\r\n\r\nIn _flatulent_ colic, the treatment should depend upon the cause. If it\r\nbe occasioned by cold, a teaspoonful or two of the Extract of\r\nSmart-weed, in warm water or catnip tea, repeated a few times, will be\r\nsufficient. If it result from overloading the stomach, a dose of the\r\nPleasant Pellets will answer the purpose. If the pain in the abdomen is\r\nsevere, apply hot fomentations. Assist the action of physic, by giving\r\nan injection of senna and catnip tea, or if the stomach is very sour,\r\ntake internally some mild alkali, such as common saleratus.\r\n\r\nIn _painters'_ colic, the following cathartic mixture is an effectual\r\nremedy: sulphate of magnesia (epsom salts), twelve ounces; nitrate of\r\npotassa (saltpeter), half an ounce; sulphuric acid, one drachm; boiling\r\nwater, one quart. Of this remedy give a teaspoonful every thirty minutes\r\nor every hour, until the bowels move. An injection of some diaphoretic\r\ntea, or of alum water, is a good remedy. Castor oil and molasses,\r\ncontaining a teaspoonful of spirits of turpentine, will add to the\r\nefficiency of an injection. If the colic be not promptly relieved, a\r\nphysician should be employed. To eliminate the lead from the system, and\r\nthus prevent a return of the colic, or other injurious effects, two\r\ndrachms of iodide of potassium should be added to a bottle of the Golden\r\nMedical Discovery, and a teaspoonful of this taken four times a day.\r\n\r\n\r\nJAUNDICE. (ICTERUS.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis affection is generally regarded as a symptom of disordered liver,\r\nsince it frequently occurs during the progress of diseases of that\r\norgan. When the disease imparts a greenish tinge to the skin, it is\r\ntermed _green jaundice,_ and, when it imparts a blackish color, it is\r\nknown as _black jaundice._ Jaundice is undoubtedly due to the presence\r\nof biliary elements in the blood.\r\n\r\nCAUSES. In consequence of the varied conditions from which it arises,\r\nProfessor Da Costa has aptly remarked: \"With the _recognition_ of\r\njaundice, the difficulty in diagnosis may be said to begin.\" He\r\nconsiders the causes of jaundice to be (1) diseases of the liver; (2)\r\ndisease or the bile ducts; (3) diseases remote from the liver, or\r\ngeneral disease leading to a disorder of that viscus; (4) certain causes\r\nacting upon the blood.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS. It is characterized by a yellowish color of the skin and of\r\nthe white of the eyes. The skin is usually dry and harsh; if it be\r\nmoist, the linen will be tinged yellow from the perspiration. The tongue\r\nis coated yellow, the mouth is dry, and the appetite impaired; there is\r\nheadache, nausea, and sometimes vomiting; there is pain in the abdomen\r\nafter eating, and in the region of the liver, and it is also felt in the\r\nright shoulder, and between the shoulder-blades. In severe cases, there\r\nis fever, accompanied with chills, despondency and loss of flesh. The\r\nstools are generally of a light clay color, and very offensive; the\r\nurine is thick and yellow. When the disease terminates fatally, there is\r\ndelirium followed by stupor.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. The first step should be to eliminate from the system, as\r\nspeedily as possible, all noxious materials. For this purpose, the\r\nspirit-vapor bath should be used. If the urine is scanty or voided with\r\ndifficulty, take acetate of potash or queen of the meadow. These may be\r\ntaken in connection with the Golden Medical Discovery and Purgative\r\nPellets, the efficacy of which has already been described in the\r\ntreatment of chronic inflammation of the liver. They are indeed valuable\r\nagents in this disease, since they increase the action of all the\r\nexcretory glands, and rapidly remove those matters, which, if retained,\r\nwould poison the system.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, acids are of great value; good hard cider or hydrochloric\r\nacid and the acid bath are frequently valuable agents.\r\n\r\nIn other cases the employment, both internally and externally, of\r\nalkalies in addition to the Golden Medical Discovery answers the purpose\r\nmuch better.\r\n\r\nAgain, there are persons who, in addition to alteratives and baths,\r\nrequire tonics. In the treatment or this affection, whatever may be the\r\nnature of the case, the use of _alteratives_ must not be forgotten, for\r\n_without_ them, the auxiliary treatment with acids, alkalies, and\r\ntonics, will not produce the desired effect.\r\n\r\nThe employment of drastic remedies is sometimes resorted to; but,\r\nalthough they may give temporary relief, the patient soon relapses into\r\nhis former condition, while if the treatment above given be adopted, the\r\nrecovery will be permanent.\r\n\r\n\r\nGALL-STONES. (BILIARY CALCULI.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are concretions found in the gall-bladder or bile duct, and vary\r\nfrom the size of a pea to that of a hen's egg. There may be no\r\nindication of their existence in the gall-bladder until they begin to\r\npass through the duct.\r\n\r\nCAUSES. The formation of gall-stones is undoubtedly due to an unhealthy\r\ncondition of the bile. Corpulent persons, and those indulging in\r\nover-stimulating diet, or in the habitual use of fermented drinks, are\r\nmost liable to be troubled by them.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS. The patient is suddenly seized with excruciating pain in the\r\nright side. After a time it subsides, but is again renewed with as great\r\nseverity as before. There is nausea, with vomiting, which is often\r\nexcessive and severe. The pulse is sometimes slower than is natural, the\r\nextremities are cold, there is great exhaustion, together with\r\nperspiration and spasmodic contraction of the abdominal muscles. As soon\r\nas one stone has passed through the duct into the intestine, immediate\r\nrelief is experienced until another commences to pass, and the larger\r\nthe concretion, the greater is the pain. If the stools be washed, the\r\ngall-stones may be seen floating on top of the water.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. This consists chiefly in relieving the patient of pain and\r\nvomiting during the passage of the gall-stones. Hot fomentations made\r\nwith stramonium leaves and lobelia, and applied over the painful parts,\r\nare beneficial. Small doses of lobelia may be taken, but not in\r\nsufficient quantities to produce vomiting. Doses of opium should also be\r\ntaken; this anodyne must, however, be used with care. Gelseminum is\r\noften useful. Chloroform, ether, or the spirit vapor-bath generally\r\nallays the pain. Carbonate of soda, dissolved in water, often relieves\r\nthe vomiting.\r\n\r\nThese distressing symptoms are apt to recur until the removal of all the\r\ngall-stones is effected. To aid in removing them, take the Golden\r\nMedical Discovery rather freely for a day or two, and continue its use\r\nwith lobelia, in doses sufficiently large to produce nausea, but not\r\nvomiting. From four to eight ounces of sweet oil may be given, and, if\r\nthe bowels do not respond within three hours, repeat the dose, and the\r\ngall-stones will generally be evacuated. To prevent the formation of\r\nthese concretions take the Golden Medical Discovery, together with\r\nalkaline drinks made with carbonate of soda. Tone and energy will\r\nthereby be imparted to the liver, the free flow of bile will be insured\r\nand the subsequent formation of gall-stones prevented.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTESTINAL WORMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have not the space to discuss the numerous theories which have been\r\noffered to account for the presence of these parasites in the human\r\nbody. We shall enumerate the principal species, describe the symptoms\r\nindicating their presence, and indicate the proper remedies.\r\n\r\nThere are five species of intestinal worms, sufficiently common to merit\r\na description.\r\n\r\n(1.) The round worm, termed by naturalists, _ascaris lumbricoides_,\r\nvaries from six inches to a foot in length, and resembles the common\r\nearth-worm. It infests the small intestines, and seldom migrates into\r\nthe stomach or large bowel. Instances are recorded, however, in which it\r\nhas crept upward in the esophagus, larynx, nostrils, and eustachian\r\ntube; but their presence in these parts is of comparatively rare\r\noccurrence, and is generally caused by some local irritation which\r\ncompels their migration. The fact that they have been found in the\r\nperitoneal sac, gave rise to the opinion that they perforate the\r\nintestine; but careful observations have proved that they can only\r\nescape through openings made by ulcers.\r\n\r\nThis species has been found in adults, but is more common in children\r\nfrom three to twelve years of age. The number of this species existing\r\nin a human body is variable. Sometimes only two or three are found. At\r\nother times a hundred, and even twice that number, are voided in a few\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n(2.) The _ascaris vermicularis_, thread, pin, or seat-worm, is round,\r\nvery slender, and about half an inch in length. The habitation of this\r\nspecies is the rectum, and they are often found matted together in the\r\nexcrement. They are very active, even after ejection, and have been\r\nknown to cause great local irritation by entering the vagina and\r\nurethra. Their presence is an occasional cause of masturbation. It is\r\nimpossible to estimate the number of these parasites that may exist in\r\nthe human rectum. Great numbers, sometimes, are voided at a single\r\nevacuation.\r\n\r\n(3.) The _tricocephalus dispar_ is a third variety of the round worm,\r\nand is said to infest the bodies of almost every species of mammalia. As\r\nits name indicates, the upper portion of its body is slender, hair-like,\r\nand terminates at the lower extremity in a thick, spiral portion. It is\r\nfrom one to two inches in length, and is found attached by its head to\r\nthe mucous membrane of the cæcum, and, in rare instances, in the colon\r\nand small intestine. They are rarely numerous.\r\n\r\n_Tæceniæ_ or _tape-worms,_ are hermaphrodites, of a flat, ribbon-like\r\nform, and are composed of numerous segments, each of which is provided\r\nwith a complete set of generative organs, and contains ova for the\r\nproduction of thousands of individuals. Some authors have supposed that\r\neach segment, or joint, is a distinct individual, but the existence of\r\none head for the whole precludes this theory. There are two species of\r\n_tæniæ_ developed in the human intestine; the _tænia solium_ and the\r\n_tænia lata_.\r\n\r\n(4.) The _tænia solium_ is the species commonly found in America and all\r\nthe countries of Europe, except France, Russia, and Switzerland. In\r\nFrance, both species are found, but the tænia lata seems to be\r\nindigenous to Russia and Switzerland.\r\n\r\nThe _tænia solium_ varies in length from four or five to thirty,\r\nthirty-five, or even forty feet. The head is hemispherical and armed\r\nwith a double row of twenty or thirty hooklets. The genital organs are\r\nalternate and placed upon the outer edges of each segment. It inhabits\r\nthe small intestine, and is usually solitary.\r\n\r\n(5.) The _tænia lata_, or broad tape-worm, is distinguished by the\r\ngreater breadth of its segments, and the location of the genital organs,\r\nwhich are found in the centre of each segment. Its small elongated head\r\nis unarmed, and has a longitudinal fissure on each side. It usually\r\nattains a greater length than the _tænia solium_.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS. The symptoms which the long worms occasion, are frequently\r\nsomewhat obscure. Thirst, irregular appetite, colicky pains, excessive\r\nflow of saliva, enlargement of the abdomen, itching of the nose, pallor\r\nof the face, offensive breath, disturbed sleep, and grinding of the\r\nteeth, all are common symptoms. Occasionally, convulsions and other\r\nnervous affections are produced by the presence of the _ascaris\r\nlumbricoides,_ but generally they produce less constitutional\r\ndisturbance than the other varieties. The passage of this species of\r\nworms from the bowels, or their ejection from the stomach, is the only\r\npositive evidence of their presence. The _ascaris vermicularis_, thread,\r\npin, or seat-worm, gives rise to most of the symptoms produced by the\r\nlong worms, but in addition produces intense itching at the anus, and,\r\nnot unfrequently, an eruption upon that part. The itching is\r\nparticularly distressing at night. When the little sufferer is well\r\ncovered, the warmth occasioned by the bed-clothes causes these little\r\nparasites to crawl out upon the anus, and produces such paroxysms of\r\nitching and pain as to cause the child to kick the covering oft and lie\r\nnaked. The persistent manifestations of a disposition to lie naked,\r\nshould excite the parents' suspicions of seat-worms, and lead them to\r\ninvestigate all the symptoms. By examining the child's stools the worms\r\nmay he found adhering to the feces, and they may also be seen on the\r\nanus. Thousands of children suffer untold agony from these little\r\nseat-worms, which are left unmolested to torment them, because the\r\nparents are unfamiliar with the meaning of the symptoms manifested, and\r\ntherefore pay no heed to them. We have been thus particular in\r\ndescribing the symptoms indicating the presence of these pestiferous\r\nparasites, in order that they may be readily detected.\r\n\r\n_The Symptoms_ produced by the tape-worm are dizziness, ringing in the\r\nears, increased secretion of saliva, indigestion, ravenous appetite,\r\nsharp abdominal pains, and emaciation. The only positive sign of the\r\npresence of these parasites, is the passage of pieces of them in the\r\nfeces. The nervous and other symptoms produced by the ordinary long\r\nworms are also caused by the tape-worm.\r\n\r\nCAUSES. Careful observations have proved that there are certain causes\r\nwhich favor the generation or development of intestinal worms. Among\r\nothers, we may mention fatty or farinaceous articles of food,\r\ngormandizing, constant exposure to a moist atmosphere, and sedentary\r\nhabits.\r\n\r\nIt is now generally conceded that the development of tape-worms is due\r\nto the swallowing of an egg or germ-cell, which is contained in many\r\nkinds of animal food, and which the process of cooking has failed to\r\ndestroy. People living near low marshes, lakes, or the seacoast, are\r\nliable to _tæniæ_.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. The expulsion of the _ascaris lumbricoides_ may be very\r\neasily and pleasantly effected. Santonin is an effectual remedy for this\r\nvariety of worms. For a child three years old, take santonin, six\r\ngrains; podophyllin, one grain; white sugar, thirty grains; mix,\r\ntriturate, and divide into twelve powders, and give one every three or\r\nfour hours, until they act upon the bowels; or take santonin, ten\r\ngrains; white sugar, twenty grains; mix, triturate, and divide into ten\r\npowders, and give one every night at bed-time, and after giving two or\r\nthree in this way, administer a mild cathartic. As santonin is almost\r\nentirely tasteless, if not combined with other medicines which are\r\nunpalatable, no difficulty will be experienced in administering it to\r\nchildren. By reference to the article on anthelmintics in this volume,\r\nother valuable vermifuges may be selected, and directions found for\r\ntheir employment.\r\n\r\nIn the removal of thread or pin-worms, anthelmintic medicines taken into\r\nthe stomach are of little or no value. An injection of a strong solution\r\nof salt, is a very efficient remedy. A teaspoonful of turpentine in half\r\na pint of milk makes a good injection. Strong coffee has been\r\nrecommended as an injection. The anus should be well anointed with\r\nvaseline, lard, oil, or fresh butter, after each movement of the bowels.\r\nWhatever injection or remedy is used, it should be followed by the\r\napplication of some ointment to the anus, otherwise they will continue\r\nto deposit their eggs about that orifice and multiply there.\r\n\r\nVarious remedies have been used to destroy tape-worms. Among others we\r\nmay mention the old and time-honored remedy, which consists of two or\r\nthree ounces of the oil of turpentine, taken in castor oil or some\r\naromatic tincture.\r\n\r\nA decoction made by boiling two or three ounces of freshly powdered\r\npomegranate bark in a pint of water was used by the ancients, and is now\r\nhighly recommended as a remedy.\r\n\r\nSome American physicians have used an emulsion of pumpkin seeds with\r\nmarked success.\r\n\r\nTwenty or thirty grains of the extract of male fern, followed by a\r\ncathartic is highly recommended for the destruction and removal of\r\ntæniæ.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRICHINA SPIRALIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1835, Owen discovered a peculiar parasite, which sometimes infests\r\nthe human body, and is termed the _trichina spiralis_. The presence of\r\nthese parasites has given rise to morbid conditions of the system,\r\nfollowed by the most serious results. They are developed in the\r\nalimentary canal, and then perforate its tissues and enter the muscles.\r\nTwelve trichinæ have been found in a section of human muscle only\r\none-twelfth of an inch square and one-fifth of an inch in thickness.\r\n\r\nThe early symptoms of trichinæ are very uncertain, being the same as\r\nthose of some other disease. The patient complains of severe pain in the\r\nabdomen and is troubled with diarrhea. When the trichinæ pass into the\r\nmuscles, they occasion great suffering. There are sharp pains in the\r\nmuscles, the perspiration is profuse, and the patient becomes exhausted.\r\n\r\nCAUSE. Nearly every case of trichinæ, which has been brought to the\r\nnotice of the profession, has been attributed to the eating of raw or\r\nimproperly cooked pork. The parasites can only be detected with a\r\nmicroscope.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. The impossibility of removing the trichinæ after they have\r\npassed into the muscles is apparent; and, as yet, no special remedy has\r\nbeen recommended to remove them from the alimentary canal. The only\r\nsafety lies in prevention. Hence raw or imperfectly cooked pork should\r\nnever be eaten.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDYSPEPSIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is generally conceded that a multitude of human ailments arise from\r\n_indigestion_, and in its various forms it taxes the skill of the\r\nphysician to prescribe the proper remedies. It is undeniable that the\r\nclosest intimacy exists between happiness and good digestion. A healthy\r\ndigestion aids materially in making a cheerful disposition, and the\r\n\"feast of reason and flow of soul\" is due as much to the functional\r\nintegrity of the stomach as to a strong and generous mental\r\norganization. Dr. Johnson severely said: \"_Every man is a rascal as soon\r\nas he is sick._\" We all know that a morbid condition irritates the\r\nindividual and excites sarcastic and disagreeable remarks. And,\r\nlikewise, an irritable temper and, suddenly aroused passions may not\r\nonly turn and disturb the stomach, but even poison the secretions.\r\nAnxiety, excitability, fear, and irritability frequently cause the\r\nperversion of physiological processes.\r\n\r\nThe slightest functional disturbance of the stomach deranges, more or\r\nless, all the succeeding operations of digestion and tends to the\r\nvitiation and impairment of the delicate processes of nutrition.\r\nDyspepsia may commence and proceed so insidiously as not to excite the\r\nsuspicion of friends, although the patient generally desires active\r\ntreatment, such as cathartics, emetics, and medicines to act upon the\r\nliver. When the disease becomes confirmed, it presents some of the\r\nfollowing symptoms: Weight, uneasiness, and fullness in the region of\r\nthe stomach, attended by impatience, irritability, sluggishness,\r\nanxiety, and melancholy; there is impairment of the appetite and taste,\r\nalso sourness, flatulency, and, perhaps, frequent attacks of colic, loss\r\nof hope, courage, and energy; apathy, drowsiness, and frightful dreams\r\nare also symptoms common in the different stages of this disease. There\r\nare, furthermore, the accompanying symptoms of a coated tongue, bitter\r\ntaste in the mouth, unpleasant eructations, scalding of the throat from\r\nregurgitation, offensive breath, sick headache, giddiness, disturbed\r\nsleep, sallow countenance, heart-burn, morbid craving after food,\r\nconstant anxiety and apprehension, fancied impotency, and fickleness.\r\nThe subjects of dyspepsia frequently imagine that they require medicines\r\nto act upon the liver, desire active treatment, are endlessly\r\nexperimenting in diet, daily rehearse their symptoms, and are morbidly\r\nsensitive.\r\n\r\nCAUSES. Overtasking the body or mind, overloading the stomach, the use\r\nof improper food, such as stale vegetables and meat, unripe fruits,\r\nindigestible articles, improperly prepared food, irregular meals,\r\ndisorderly habits, the use of alcoholic stimulants, loss of sleep,\r\nmasturbation irritability of temper, anxiety, or grief may all give rise\r\nto indigestion. If the functions performed by the skin are embarrassed\r\nby cold, tight clothing, or lack of cleanliness, the nutritive changes\r\ncannot properly take place throughout the body, and consequently the\r\ndigestive functions are embarrassed, as the revolutions of a water-wheel\r\nare impeded by the backset of the water. When food is not thoroughly\r\nmasticated, it is not properly mixed with saliva of the glands of the\r\nmouth, and is not prepared for digestion by the acids of the stomach.\r\n\r\nWhatever diminishes the general strength, impairs the health, or\r\nencroaches upon the functions of life, also hinders the perfect solution\r\nof food and disturbs in a measure the function of digestion. Whatever\r\ndiminishes the normal amount of the digestive secretions or perverts\r\ntheir quality, deteriorating their solvent properties, is a cause of\r\ndyspepsia. This should be borne in mind in selecting remedies.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. The hygienic treatment consists in the regulation of the\r\ndaily habits, proper selection and preparation of the food, cultivation\r\nof cheerfulness, diversion of the mind, and cleanliness of person. We\r\ncannot give particular directions as to the kind of diet, as there are\r\nno established rules for guidance. Generally, a dyspeptic knows best,\r\nfrom experience, what articles of diet can be taken with the least\r\ninjury. The directions applicable to the condition of one patient, are\r\nnot suited to those of another. In dyspepsia, animal food is, as a rule,\r\npreferable. Foods rich in starchy matter often ferment and produce\r\ndistress. Sometimes alkalies may be given with beneficial effect, when\r\nthere seems to be an excess of acid in the gastric secretions.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, the digestive fluids are weak and fermentation results,\r\ngiving rise to flatulency and belching. An antiseptic, which may be\r\nprepared by mixing a teaspoonful of hydrochloric acid with four ounces\r\nof water, of which a teaspoonful may be taken after each meal, will\r\nprove beneficial to check the fermentation and aid digestion. The\r\naddition of one or two drops of a mixture of one part of carbolic acid\r\nand six of glycerine, to the above solution of hydrochloric acid\r\nimproves its antiseptic properties. Or, Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical\r\nDiscovery will stop undue fermentation, and from its tonic and\r\ninvigorating effect upon the lining membranes of the stomach will\r\ngenerally overcome the indigestion. Some people are afraid to take it,\r\nwhen suffering from indigestion, because it has a sweet taste. But the\r\nsweet is not saccharine, or sugar sweet, but an entirely different sweet\r\nprinciple which prevents fermentation instead of promoting it.\r\n\r\nAcidity of the stomach and the attendant irritation may be allayed by\r\nthe following mixture: Calcined magnesia, one drachm; refined sugar, one\r\ndrachm; subnitrate of bismuth, one-half drachm; oil of cajeput, ten\r\ndrops. The dose is half a teaspoonful an hour after every meal. Any\r\ndispensing druggist can put it up.\r\n\r\nIt is frequently difficult to prevent the patient from over-distending\r\nthe stomach, and thus impairing the tone of the muscular coats and\r\nprolonging the process of digestion.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of debility, over-exertion, anxiety, or chronic\r\ninflammation of the stomach, there is not a proper secretion, in\r\nquantity or quality, of digestive solvents, and it matters not whether\r\nit be a deficiency of the fluids of the stomach, or of the intestines,\r\nor of the pancreas and liver, the result is indigestion. The question of\r\nwhat important agent is lacking, naturally presents itself to the\r\nphysician. Is it _pepsin_, the active principle of the gastric juice,\r\nwhich converts proteids into peptone, that is wanting, or is there a\r\ndeficiency of _pancreatin_? Of course the principle which is lacking\r\nshould be supplied; but has the physician the remedial agents properly\r\nprepared, and ready for prescribing? The specialist, having more cases\r\nof dyspepsia to treat than the general practitioner, is more likely to\r\nhave the latest and most approved remedies applicable to loss of\r\nappetite, indigestion, impoverished blood, imperfect assimilation, and\r\nall diseases arising from faulty nutrition. In ordinary practice, the\r\nphysician's time is divided in his consideration of acute, chronic,\r\nsurgical, and obstetrical cases; in fact, much of it is occupied in\r\nriding to reach his patients. His attention is continually diverted from\r\none class of cases to another, effectually preventing investigation in\r\nany particular direction. His patronage does not warrant him in the\r\noutlay of time required for the investigation of particular diseases,\r\nand the expense necessary to obtain the latest and best remedial agents\r\nfor their treatment. In the multiplicity of his cares and arduous duties\r\nby night and by day, obstinate chronic cases become an annoyance to him,\r\nand whenever he can be otherwise professionally employed, he avoids\r\nthem, disliking to undertake their treatment.\r\n\r\nWith plenty of time for scientific investigation, ample facilities to\r\nmeet the demands upon his skill, and each succeeding case presenting\r\nsome new phase, the treatment becomes a matter of absorbing interest to\r\nthe specialist, and each success inspires greater confidence. We not\r\nonly use in the treatment of indigestion, solvent remedies, like pepsin,\r\nwhich act only upon proteids, but also other remedies of recent\r\ndiscovery, which exert a remarkable curative influence in diseases of\r\nthe digestive organs.\r\n\r\nThe chemistry of digestion and of life is becoming better understood.\r\nAny of the free acids may serve to dissolve a precipitated phosphate;\r\nbut it is only the investigating therapeutist and experienced\r\npractitioner who understands which of them is the _most_ and which is\r\nthe _least_ efficacious. Alkalies may dissolve lithic deposits, but who,\r\nunless he be an experienced physician, can detect the fault of nutrition\r\nwhich leads to their formation, or rightly interpret the symptoms\r\nindicating it? These simple illustrations of the complications which\r\nattend dyspepsia, are mentioned merely to show that they must be\r\nanticipated and taken into account in the treatment.\r\n\r\nThe number of cases of dyspeptic invalids treated by the staff of the\r\nInvalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute within file past few years, is so\r\nlarge as scarcely to be credited by those unacquainted with the\r\nprevalence of this disease. For this reason we have taken unusual pains\r\nto investigate the causes of the disease, and have spared no expense to\r\nprovide the most approved digestive solvents, and stomachic tonics,\r\nwhich invigorate the mucous membrane of the stomach, and materially\r\nassist in reducing the food to a liquid condition. Some of these,\r\nwithout being purgative, increase the activity of the liver, and\r\nstimulate the intestinal secretions, two very important indications\r\nwhich should be fulfilled by remedies which cause no real depression.\r\nThe recent important discoveries made in obtaining the active principles\r\nfrom indigenous plants, has opened the way to the use of a few of the\r\nmost important of these remedial agents, hitherto almost wholly unknown\r\nto the medical profession, and the encouraging results attending our\r\npractice have amply repaid us for the investigation and originality in\r\nour treatment of this affection.\r\n\r\nA careful chemical and microscopical examination of the urine often\r\ndiscloses the actual morbid conditions which perpetuate this functional\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONIC DIARRHEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn account of the frequency and importance of chronic diarrhea, we deem\r\nit worthy of special consideration. It is frequently the sequel of the\r\nacute form of the affection. The urgent and severe symptoms of acute\r\ndiarrhea are often abated, but the disease is not completely cured. The\r\nbowels are left in an irritable condition, perhaps in a state of chronic\r\nulceration, which perpetuates morbid discharges.\r\n\r\nThe most noticeable symptom is the tendency to frequent and unhealthy\r\ndischarges from the intestines. The evacuated matter varies much in\r\nappearance and character in different cases. The precise location of the\r\nmorbid conditions which give rise to the discharges, as well as to their\r\nextent, modifies the color, consistency, and ingredients of the stools.\r\nMost frequently they are dark colored and of very offensive odor. They\r\nare of a more liquid character than is natural, except when, as is\r\nsometimes the case, periods of constipation alternate with periods of\r\nunnatural looseness. Tormina, or griping, is usually present, but not so\r\nsevere as in the acute affection. Tenesmus, or straining, often\r\naccompanies it. The appetite is impaired, there is general debility, and\r\nthe patient is nervous and irritable. The complexion becomes sallow, the\r\nskin dry and rough, the tongue dark colored, and the body emaciated.\r\n\r\nThe affection may be the sequel of neglected or badly treated acute\r\ndiarrhea, may arise from the injudicious use of powerful purgative\r\nmedicines, may result from dissipation, unwholesome food, bad air,\r\nabsence of light, long continued exposure to dampness and cold,\r\noverwork, and extreme mental anxiety. Sometimes it is associated with\r\nother diseases, such as Bright's disease of the kidneys, scurvy, or some\r\nof the various forms of scrofulous disease.\r\n\r\nThe more prominent symptoms are so apparent and so characteristic that\r\nthe most unskilled may be able to decide whether the patient has chronic\r\ndiarrhea; but to determine in what portion of the intestinal canal the\r\naffection is chiefly seated, to decide upon the extent of its ravages,\r\nto ascertain what peculiar shade or type the affection has taken on, to\r\ninvestigate its complications and modifications, to ferret out its\r\nproducing or aggravating causes, and above all, to nicely and skillfully\r\nadjust remedies to meet the depraved conditions, is by no means an easy\r\ntask, even for the educated and experienced physician. It should be\r\nborne in mind that this is a dangerous malady, and one which should not\r\nbe trifled with or neglected. Its tendency is to corrode and destroy the\r\nbowels, a process which if unchecked, must sooner or latter result in\r\ndeath. There is little tendency to spontaneous recovery, nor is a\r\nremoval of the exciting cause often followed by recovery. The disease\r\nbecomes so firmly seated, and the powers of life so debilitated, that\r\nnature cannot rally.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. A warm, salt bath, several times a week, taken at bed-time,\r\nis beneficial. Flannel should be worn next to the skin, and the\r\nsleeping-room should be warm and well ventilated.\r\n\r\nAs will be seen from testimonials hereinafter inserted, Dr. Pierce's\r\nGolden Medical Discovery has achieved great success in curing chronic\r\ndiarrhea. Its use should be persisted in for a considerable time to\r\nstrengthen and tone up the bowels. To relieve the discharges, take Dr.\r\nPierce's Compound Extract of Smart Weed, as needed from time to time.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONIC INFLAMMATION OF THE LIVER.\r\n\r\n(CHRONIC HEPATITIS.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is what is ordinarily termed _liver complaint, torpid liver, and\r\nbilious disorder_.\r\n\r\nUnder this head may be considered all those chronic affections known as\r\ncongestion, induration, and enlargement of the liver, and which result\r\nin deficient action, functional derangement, morbid secretion of bile,\r\nand various chronic affections.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS. Owing to the liability of other organs to become diseased\r\nduring the progress of chronic affections of the liver, great precision\r\nin diagnosis is required to determine, by the symptoms, the organ which\r\nis _primarily_ diseased and those secondarily affected. This requires\r\nnot only familiarity with the signs of a complicated disease, but also\r\nthorough anatomical knowledge of the diseased organ, of the morbid\r\nchanges which occur in its structure, and their influence on its own\r\nfunctions, as well as on those of other organs.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms may differ according to the circumstances, temperament,\r\nsex, age, or constitution of the individual, and the complications of\r\nthe disease. The local indications are fullness of the right side, thus\r\ndenoting congestion of the liver; a dull, heavy pain, which is increased\r\nby pressure or by lying on the left side; a sense of fullness, weight,\r\nand oppression about the stomach; an aching in the right shoulder-blade;\r\na dull, disagreeable pain in the shoulder-joint, which may extend down\r\nthe arm, and which is sometimes felt in the wrist and joints of the hand\r\nNot unfrequently the complexion becomes pale and sallow, and there is\r\npuffiness under the eye, headache, a bitter taste in the mouth, tongue\r\ncoated white or covered with a brown fur, and hardness of the gums;\r\nthere is frequent sighing, a hacking cough, fever, restlessness, and\r\nloss of sleep; sometimes an unnatural, greasy appearance of the skin, at\r\nothers, it is dry and harsh, has scaly or branny eruptions, pimples,\r\ndark blotches, and troublesome itching. The urine is frequently scanty\r\nand high-colored, but variable as to quantity and appearance; it often\r\nproduces a scalding sensation when voided, and, if allowed to stand,\r\ndeposits a sediment which sometimes contains albumen. The pulse is very\r\nslow, particularly when the elements of the bile are not eliminated from\r\nthe blood. The pulsations of the heart are easily quickened, and\r\npalpitation is excited if the subject be low and anæmic. There is\r\ndepression of spirits, and a decided tendency to be discouraged and\r\ndespondent. The functional powers of the stomach are impaired; there is\r\nloss of appetite, or it becomes capricious; uneasiness is felt in the\r\nregion of the stomach, oppression, sometimes nausea and water-brash, or\r\nthere is indigestion, flatulency, and acid eructations; the bowels\r\nbecome irregular, usually constipated, and occasionally subject to\r\nobstinate diarrhea attended with colicky pains; the stools are of a\r\nlight clay color, sometimes hard and dark, again thin and very\r\noffensive, and occasionally green or black. As the disease progresses,\r\nduring the day the circulation is sluggish, the feet and hands are cold,\r\nbut at night the pulse is accelerated, and a burning sensation is felt\r\nin the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing symptoms are not all present in one case, nor are any two\r\ncases alike in every respect. They vary according to the organs most\r\nimplicated in the hepatic derangement. Thus, when chronic inflammation\r\nof the liver is associated with _heart_ disease, the subject may have\r\npalpitation, excessive or defective action of the heart, attended with\r\nmore or less pain and shortness of breath. If the _lungs_ be specially\r\ninfluenced, then, in addition to the ordinary hepatic symptoms, there\r\nmay be a dry cough, asthma, hurried respiration, bronchitis, hoarseness,\r\nand pain in the chest. If the _stomach_ be the sympathizing organ, the\r\ntongue is coated white or brown, there is nausea, loss of appetite,\r\nflatulency, acidity, dyspepsia, fullness, and oppression, amounting,\r\nsometimes, to pain in the stomach after taking food; the food ferments\r\nand gives rise to eructations and various other manifestations of\r\ndisorder. If the _bowels_ are morbidly influenced by this affection,\r\nthere is constipation or diarrhea, griping pain, distension of the\r\nabdomen, piles, and pain just within the points of the hips, thus\r\nindicating irritation of The colon. If the _brain_ or _nervous system_\r\nsensitively responds, there is headache, dizziness, disturbed sleep,\r\ndepression of spirits, peevishness, capriciousness, lack of energy,\r\nirritability, and congestive symptoms. When the _skin_ is involved the\r\nsurface is dry, harsh, and scaly, displaying dark \"moth-spots,\"\r\nblotches, or numerous little sores, and the countenance has a dull,\r\ntawny look. If the _kidneys_ be disturbed by it, there may be pain and a\r\nsensation of weight in the back, while the urine may be scanty and\r\nhigh-colored, or abundant, pale, and limpid, frequently charged with\r\nsedimentary products of disease, and voided with difficulty. If the\r\n_womb_ be implicated in this chronic affection, the menstrual function\r\nmay be deranged, and result in an excessive or a deficient monthly flow,\r\nand be followed by profuse leucorrhea.\r\n\r\nThe preceding allusion to the complications of chronic inflammation of\r\nthe liver shows the necessity of clearly distinguishing between the\r\nsymptoms of this disorder and those reflected by the organs which\r\nsympathetically respond. To discriminate more effectually, and place the\r\ncorrectness of the diagnosis beyond doubt, we make a chemical and\r\nmicroscopical examination of the urine, and thereby detect the morbid\r\nproducts which it contains, and direct our attention to the diseased\r\norgans furnishing them. These examinations together with a complete\r\nhistory of the case, enable us to make a correct and definite diagnosis\r\nof the disease, and the extent to which it has affected the other\r\norgans.\r\n\r\nBefore entering upon the consideration of treatment, let us briefly\r\nenumerate the functions of the liver: _First_, it removes matter, which,\r\nif allowed to remain in the blood, would become noxious and unfit it for\r\nthe further support of the body. _Secondly_, by secreting bile, it\r\nfurnishes to the digestive organs a fluid which assists in converting\r\nthe food into chyle, stimulates the intestine to action, and then is\r\nitself transformed and absorbed with the chylous products, after which\r\nit circulates with the blood and assists in nutrition until, becoming\r\ninjurious and pernicious, it is re-secreted and re-elaborated to serve\r\nagain, as described.\r\n\r\nFor its growth and nourishment, the liver is furnished with blood by the\r\nhepatic artery; but for the purpose of secretion and depuration, it is\r\nabundantly supplied with venous blood by the portal system, which is\r\nmade up of veins from the spleen, stomach, pancreas, and intestines.\r\nThis impure, venous blood, surcharged with biliary elements, which must\r\nbe withdrawn from it, is freely poured into the minute network of this\r\nglandular organ. In a healthy condition of the liver, the carbonaceous\r\nelements of the blood are converted into sugar, and the constituents of\r\nthe bile are liberated by the liver, and set apart for further duties.\r\nWhen it fails to eliminate these noxious elements from the blood, it is\r\nitself thoroughly vitiated by them.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. Food must be rich in carbon in order that it may build up the\r\ntissues and keep the body warm, but carbonic acid, the result of the\r\ncombustion, must be removed from the blood, or death will ensue. So bile\r\nis necessary to digestion, nutrition, and life; yet, if it be not\r\nseparated from the blood by the secreting action of the liver, it will\r\nas surely poison the system and destroy life as carbonic acid. Although\r\nthe constituents of the bile exist in the blood, they must be removed in\r\norder that the blood may be rendered more fit to support the body, while\r\nthe secreted bile is destined to assist in digestion, and the mysterious\r\nprocess of nutrition. Therefore, we should induce a secretion of bile,\r\nand restore the normal activity of the liver. This should be done, not\r\nby administering stimulants, but by relieving it of all contingent\r\nembarrassments as far as possible. Would any one think of giving to a\r\nweak, debilitated man large portions of brandy to enable him to work?\r\nDoes not every one know that, when the unnatural stimulus is removed, he\r\nfails? Apply this principle in the treatment of the liver. When harsh,\r\nunnatural stimulants and \"bile-driving\" medicines are administered for a\r\ntime and then withheld, the liver relapses into a more torpid and\r\ndebilitated condition than before treatment was begun. Is not this true\r\nof nine-tenths of all who suffer from this malady, and have recourse to\r\nthis class of remedies?\r\n\r\nThen how can we remedially fulfill the preceding indications? We answer\r\nin the language of a distinguished author and standard medical writer,\r\n\"by using a class of agents which should never be overlooked in the\r\ntreatment of long-standing liver diseases, chiefly addressed to the\r\nblood and denominated '_alteratives._'\"\r\n\r\n_Alteratives, tonics_, and _restorative catalytics_ are required not\r\nonly in diseases of the liver, but in a large number of ailments in\r\nwhich the blood becomes charged with morbid materials. The active\r\nremedial properties of the most efficient agents of the above classes of\r\nmedicine now known, are scientifically combined in the \"Golden Medical\r\nDiscovery,\" which acts _especially_ upon the blood, and hence influences\r\nthe system generally. It is also powerful in eliminating those morbid\r\nhumors which are afterwards subjected to excretion through various\r\norgans.\r\n\r\nIts action is radically different from most medicines employed in\r\nchronic diseases, for the reason, that what is usually prescribed, is\r\nsomething corrosive. Unless the disease be temporary, it may return with\r\nincreased violence.\r\n\r\nWe have been very minute in the description of the remedial properties\r\nof the \"Golden Medical Discovery,\" and have relied upon the reason and\r\nintelligence of our patrons, believing that they can, in a degree,\r\nunderstand why we deem it so applicable to the system. It does not\r\ndebilitate the liver by over-stimulation, nor irritate the stomach and\r\nbowels by disturbing the delicate processes of digestion, neither does\r\nit act with severity upon the blood, but it operates so gently,\r\ninsensibly, and yet with so much certainty, that it excites the surprise\r\nand admiration of the patient.\r\n\r\nFrom the careful detail of its various properties, there is abundant\r\nreason for its favorable action upon all of the excretory organs, which\r\nco-operate in the removal of morbid materials from the system. If,\r\nhowever, the bowels are unusually sluggish or obstinately constipated,\r\nit is advisable, in conjunction with the \"Golden Medical Discovery,\" to\r\nuse the \"Pleasant Pellets,\" which are also powerfully alterative,\r\nbesides being mild and unirritating in their operation. They are the\r\nnatural assistants of the \"Discovery,\" working harmoniously together.\r\nThey should be taken in small doses, and their use perseveringly\r\nfollowed, until the bowels are properly regulated by the use of the\r\n\"Discovery\" alone.\r\n\r\nIt has been customary to resort to powerful drastic cathartics, followed\r\nby bitters prepared in dilute alcohol. The habit is unscientific, for it\r\nis well known that alcohol deranges the functions of the digestive\r\norgans and depraves the blood, besides creating a morbid appetite. It\r\nhas been repeatedly demonstrated that the use of such bitters has led to\r\na life of drunkenness, with all the woe and untold misery which attend\r\nit.\r\n\r\nMedicines to be strictly remedial, should exert a tonic influence upon\r\nall the vital processes. Those organs which are contiguous to the liver,\r\nor connected by sympathy with it, should be assisted in the performance\r\nof their functions. Persons who are habitually subject to \"bilious\"\r\nattacks are pleased to find that the use of the \"Discovery\" and\r\n\"Pellets\" furnishes immunity from such onsets, and prevents their usual\r\nrecurrence. Thus these remedies are _preventive_ as well as _curative_.\r\n\r\nWhat we have thus far recommended for the treatment of this chronic\r\naffection is within the reach of every family. Patients laboring under\r\nthis disease, when complicated with other affections, require special\r\nconsideration and treatment, and all such are counseled to employ only\r\nthose physicians whose experience and success entitle them to\r\nconfidence. Health is one of the greatest of blessings, and how to\r\nrestore it when lost, is a question of vital importance.\r\n\r\nHaving successfully treated thousands of invalids who have suffered from\r\nthis chronic affection, we possess abundant evidence of the curability\r\nof the disease, but we have only space to publish a few letters from\r\npersons who have been under our care, or who have used our medicines,\r\npurchased from druggists.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSTIPATION. (COSTIVENESS.)\r\n\r\n\r\nHealth depends very largely upon the regularity of the bowels. There\r\nshould be proper alvine evacuations every day. There are few persons who\r\nhave not suffered at some period of their lives from constipation of the\r\nbowels. Inattentive to the calls of nature, or a neglect to regularly\r\nattend to this important duty, sooner or later, produces disastrous\r\nresults. Furthermore, it is essential to the comfort of every\r\nindividual, for, when this function is not performed, there is\r\nderangement of the mental as well as of the bodily organs.\r\n\r\nConstipation, or _costiveness_, as it is sometimes termed, is a\r\nfunctional derangement of the large intestine. This intestine is about\r\nfive feet in length, and consists of the cæcum, colon, and rectum. It\r\nserves as a temporary reservoir for the excrementitial residue of\r\nalimentary matter, and for the effete materials excreted by the glands\r\ncontained in its mucous coats. It is distinguished as the _large_\r\nintestine, because of its great size.\r\n\r\nHabitual constipation produces many derangements, resulting from\r\n_sympathy, irritation_, or _mechanical obstruction_. By referring to\r\nFigs. 4 and 9, the reader may observe the anatomical relations which the\r\nlarge intestine sustains to the other abdominal organs. The ascending\r\ncolon arises in the cæcum (Fig. 4), at the lower part of the abdomen,\r\nand passes over the kidney on the right side, where it begins a\r\ncircuitous route around the abdominal cavity, comes in contact with the\r\ninferior surface of the liver, proceeds behind and below the large\r\ncurvature of the stomach, emerges on the left side, and passes downward\r\nin front of the left kidney, where it dips into the pelvic cavity, and\r\nends in the rectum.\r\n\r\nIf fecal matters are retained until they are decomposed, great injury\r\nfollows, since the fluid portions are absorbed, conveyed into the blood,\r\nand, of necessity, corrupt it with their impurities. In this way,\r\nconstipation may be the source of general derangement, but _such_\r\ndisorder is seldom attributed to the torpid state of this intestine.\r\nThere is little doubt but that it thereby imposes a great tax upon the\r\nfunctions of the liver, and, frequently, the fault is attributed to that\r\norgan instead of the large intestine. Sometimes the blood becomes so\r\ncharged with fecal matter that its odor can be detected in the breath of\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\nAn overloaded condition of the large intestine may cause inflammation of\r\nthe liver or dropsy of the abdomen. When the colon is distended, it\r\nbecomes a mechanical impediment to the free circulation of the blood in\r\nother organs, and causes congestion of the portal system, predisposing\r\nto chronic inflammation or cirrhosis of the liver. This latter is a\r\nstructural affection, and may, in turn, give rise to abdominal dropsy.\r\nIn a word, the accumulation of feces in the colon irritates both the\r\nlarge and small intestines, thus causing congestion of the bowels,\r\nliver, or stomach.\r\n\r\nThe protracted presence of feculent matter deadens the sensibility of\r\nthe intestine, so that great stimulation is required to provoke it to\r\naction. The contents become dry, solid, knotty, and hard, and very\r\ndifficult to evacuate. If drastic, irritating physic be taken, only\r\n_temporary_ relief is afforded, and it must be repeatedly resorted to,\r\nand the dose increased, to obtain the desired effect.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS. One diagnostic symptom of a loaded state of the colon, is an\r\nabundant secretion of urine, as limpid as water. The direct symptoms\r\nrelate to the hardness of the feces and the great difficulty of voiding\r\nthem. The influence of constipation upon the functions of the liver, is\r\nindicated by the sympathy displayed between that organ and the mind. The\r\npatient manifests apprehension, mental depression, taciturnity, and\r\nmelancholy, all indicative of hypochondriac dejection, induced by\r\nconstipation.\r\n\r\nWe have treated patients, who, from this cause, had renounced their\r\nbright hopes, lost their buoyant spirits, and, becoming subject to\r\nsuperstitious fears, had given themselves up, night and day, to\r\ndevotions and penance. It often happens that the victims of this deep\r\ndejection and morbid feeling of self-abasement, are persons not only of\r\ngood moral character, but of high religious attainments, and their\r\npainful exhibitions of fear, distrust, and gloom, originate in\r\n_physical_ rather than in spiritual causes. It is interesting to witness\r\nthis strange perversion of the imagination, this morbid debasement of\r\nthe religious faculties, and dejection of mind, due to causes disturbing\r\nthe functions of the liver and other vital organs.\r\n\r\nYoung girls, as they approach the age of puberty, seem possessed with\r\nthe idea that the unfrequent action of the bowels is a desirable habit.\r\nThey do not associate with the duty a proper regard for health, but\r\nconsider it as an inelegant and repugnant practice. The consequence is,\r\nthat at this susceptible period, constipation, induced by neglect,\r\narouses a latent hepatic or pulmonary disease which has been lurking in\r\nthe system.\r\n\r\nHow many girls illustrate the truth of this statement by their\r\ncomplaints of dizziness, throbbing pain in the forehead and temples,\r\nflushing of the face, transient flushes of heat over the body, while at\r\nthe same time the extremities are cold. At other times, they manifest\r\nthe evils of such a course by their stupor, drowsiness, and deep sleep,\r\nalthough upon arising in the morning, they are still tired and\r\nunrefreshed.\r\n\r\nThe constipated condition of the bowels, often leads to congestion of\r\nthe uterus and leucorrhea, followed by uterine debility, prolapsus,\r\nexcessive menstruation, anteversion or retroversion of that organ. The\r\ninfrequency of the habit, incorrectly supposed to be desirable by a\r\nyoung woman, becomes nearly, if not quite disastrous to all her desires\r\nand bright prospects. Complications arise, and neither the inexperienced\r\ngirl nor her solicitous and afflicted parents know where to look for\r\nremedial aid. If they seek an asylum from these sufferings, they find\r\nmany private institutions, where flattering expectations of speedy\r\nrecovery are aroused. At such institutions, these uterine disorders are\r\ngenerally treated merely as local diseases, while the causes are\r\noverlooked, and, consequently, a permanent cure is not effected. Having\r\nspent nearly all the money at her command, the patient returns home\r\nutterly disheartened. After such failures, many of these unfortunate\r\nindividuals have applied to us and received treatment, and by\r\npersistently following our directions, have in due time been restored to\r\nhealth, amid all the comforts of home, and among friends, who rejoiced\r\nwith them in the unexpectedly favorable turn of affairs, accomplished at\r\na comparatively trifling expense.\r\n\r\nWe have seen infants, and also young children, in whom constipation was\r\nobstinate. It therefore seems that it is often hereditary. In some\r\npersons, this affection continues from childhood, with but little\r\nvariation, until bleeding pile tumors are developed. Habitual\r\nconstipation of the bowels for a long period of years will generate a\r\nclass of diseases, which are often very serious in their results.\r\n\r\nCAUSES. We have already alluded to a sense of false modesty which\r\nprevents a response to the calls of nature, and we may mention other\r\nreasons, equally trifling, which deter many from fulfilling its demands.\r\nSome are in the habit of temporarily postponing their visits to the\r\nwater closet, until, when they do go, they find themselves unable to\r\nevacuate the bowels. Sometimes the closet is a damp, uncomfortable\r\nout-house, situated at a distance from the dwelling, or the access is\r\ntoo public, and, hence, there is an unwillingness to visit it at the\r\nproper time. Some appear to be too indolent to attend to this duty.\r\nOthers are too energetic, and think they cannot take the time, until\r\nthey have finished some self-imposed task or attended to a pressing\r\nengagement.\r\n\r\nInactive life and sedentary occupations are also causes of constipation.\r\nActive exercise promotes all the bodily functions, and helps to regulate\r\nthe bowels. Those who are engaged in literary pursuits, find that mental\r\noccupation determines the blood to the brain, thus drawing it from the\r\nextremities; the temperature falls below the natural standard, and there\r\nis almost invariably congestion of the bowels. The inmates of\r\nboarding-schools, factory girls, seamstresses, milliners, employés in\r\nmanufacturing establishments, and all who sit and toil almost\r\nunremittingly twelve hours in the day, do not get sufficient exercise of\r\nall the muscles of the body, and are often troubled with obstinate\r\nconstipation.\r\n\r\nFood prepared according to the modern modes of cookery, is one of the\r\ncauses which favors the developement of this derangement. People live\r\ntoo exclusively upon bolted wheat flour. The branny portion of a kernel\r\nof wheat consists of various nutritive elements, with more than five\r\ntimes the amount of phosphate of lime contained in fine bolted flour.\r\nThose who daily use boiled cracked wheat are not troubled by\r\nconstipation. There is no dryness or hardness of the feces, and the\r\nbowels are evacuated without discomfort.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. Prevention is always better than cure; hence, a few hygienic\r\ndirections may not be amiss. Do not disregard the intimations of nature,\r\nbut promptly respond to her calls. If there is constipation, overcome it\r\nby establishing the habit of making daily efforts to effect a movement\r\nof the bowels. Taking regular exercise by walking, and lightly\r\npercussing or kneading the bowels for five minutes daily, help to\r\nincrease their activity. The habit of early rising favors the natural\r\naction of the bowels. Drinking a glass of water on rising exerts a\r\nbeneficial influence. The food should be such as will excite the mucous\r\nsecretion of the large intestines, and arouse its muscles to action. For\r\nthis purpose, there is no one article that excels coarsely-cracked\r\nboiled wheat. Graham bread, mush, cakes, gems, and all articles of diet\r\nmade from unbolted wheat flour are valuable auxiliaries, and may be\r\nprepared to suit the taste. Take the meals at stated hours; be punctual\r\nin attendance, regular in eating, and thoroughly masticate your food.\r\nIrregularity in the intervals between eating, disturbs the functions of\r\nthe intestine. The use of ripe fruits, such as apples, pears, grapes,\r\nfigs, and prunes, in proper quantities, is sometimes very beneficial.\r\nTrivial or unimportant as these hygienic suggestions may appear, yet\r\nwere they observed, constipation, as well as most of the diseases\r\nincident to it, would be obviated. A large proportion of the cases will\r\nyield to the foregoing hygienic treatment without the employment of\r\nmedicines. Should it be necessary, however, to employ an aperient to\r\nrelieve the constipation, Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery will act\r\nmost congenially, and will be followed by no constipating reaction,\r\nwhich invariably occurs when drastic cathartics are employed. Its\r\noperation is mild, bringing about a healthy action by promoting the\r\nbiliary and other secretions, thus aiding nature in establishing normal\r\nfunctional activity in the bowels. Recourse should be had to it before\r\nemploying any thing more strongly cathartic. However, should it prove\r\ntoo mild in its aperient effects, small doses of Dr. Pierce's Pleasant\r\nPellets may be employed daily to assist it. Unlike other cathartics,\r\nthey produce a secondary tonic effect upon the bowels, which renders\r\ntheir influence more lasting than that of other purgatives. We cannot\r\ntoo strongly discourage the injurious custom which many people have of\r\nfrequently _scouring_ out their bowels with strong cathartics. It is a\r\nbad practice, and cannot fail to do injury. The greatest benefit is\r\nderived, not from cathartic doses, but from taking only one or two of\r\nthe \"Pellets\" per day, or enough to keep the bowels regular, and\r\ncontinuing their use for several weeks, in connection with Dr. Pierce's\r\nGolden Medical Discovery, strictly carrying out the hygienic treatment\r\nheretofore advised.\r\n\r\nThe medical treatment of individual cases sometimes involves many\r\nconsiderations relative to the particular circumstances and\r\ncomplications presented. The peculiar susceptibility of the\r\nconstitution, as well as the diseases incident to constipation, must be\r\ntaken into account. Symptomatic derangement should not be treated as\r\nprimary, although it is by inexperienced physicians. If the patient be\r\nafflicted with uterine disease, piles, nervous affections, falling of\r\nthe lower bowel, or fistula, they should be treated in connection with\r\nthis disease. For these reasons, we would advise our readers to submit\r\nall complicated cases, or those that do not yield to the course\r\nheretofore advised, to a physician of large experience in the management\r\nof chronic diseases, and not assume the great responsibility and the\r\ndire consequences which are very liable to arise from the improper\r\ntreatment of such cases. We have been called upon to treat thousands of\r\ncases of this troublesome affection, and as a result of our vast\r\nexperience, and in consequence of our original and improved methods of\r\ndiagnosis, it is not generally necessary that we should see and examine\r\nthe patient in person. We can almost always determine the exact nature\r\nof the patient's malady, and its stage of advancement, without seeing\r\nthe subject in person.\r\n\r\n\r\nPILES. (HEMORRHOIDS.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are few maladies more common than this, and few which are more\r\nannoying. Piles consist of tumors formed within the rectum and about the\r\nanus, by dilatation of the hemorrhoidal veins and thickening of their\r\nwalls. Sometimes, when attended by considerable inflammation, or when\r\nthe attacks are very frequent, there is thickening of the adjacent\r\ncellular and mucous tissues.\r\n\r\nThere are two general forms of this disease, the external or blind\r\npiles, in which the tumors are outside the anus, and the internal or\r\nbleeding piles, in which the tumors are formed within the sphincters,\r\nalthough after their formation they may protrude. The external piles are\r\ncommonly made up of thick tissues; upon one side, the skin forms the\r\ncovering, while on the inner surface is the mucous membrane of the\r\nbowel. It is this surface which is most tender and irritable and liable\r\nto inflammation. The internal form of the disease is situated from a\r\nhalf an inch to two and a half inches above the sphincter muscle of the\r\nanus. The tumors are usually round, oval or cylindrical in form. They\r\nmay be scattered over the surface of the bowel, or clustered together.\r\nThe illustrations (Figs. 1 and 2) show the two forms of the disease. The\r\ntwo protruding tumors in Fig. 2, illustrate the usual form of prolapsing\r\ninternal piles, whilst the one highest up in the bowel shows the form\r\nmost commonly met with. It is seldom that one pile tumor is found alone,\r\nthere usually being two or three, and sometimes as many as five or six,\r\nin a cluster. Fig. 3 shows the manner of distribution of the veins in\r\nthe rectal region. The small venous loops, or bulb-like terminations of\r\nthe veins H. _i_., are the points at which the piles most frequently\r\noccur.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.\r\nSwollen External\r\nPiles.]\r\n\r\nCAUSES. Whatever tends to favor an undue accumulation of blood in the\r\nhemorrhoidal veins predisposes to piles. For this reason the affection\r\nis frequently a result of diseases of the heart and liver, which cause\r\nan obstruction in the circulation of the blood through the portal vein.\r\nMechanical pressure from tumors in the abdomen, pregnancy, or an\r\nenlarged or misplaced uterus, is not infrequently a cause of the\r\ndisease, by keeping the hemorrhoidal veins over-distended. Those\r\ndiseases which provoke much straining, as stricture, inflammation or\r\nenlargement of the prostate gland, and stone in the bladder are also\r\nactive causative agents. The most common cause of all, however, is\r\nconstipation; and persons of indolent, sedentary and luxurious habits of\r\nlife are the ones most frequently affected with this derangement. The\r\nfollowing are also prolific causes of piles, viz.: pelvic tumors,\r\nviolent horseback exercise, indigestion, pregnancy, habitual use of\r\ndrastic cathartics, diarrhea, dysentery, sitting on heated cushions,\r\nlong-continued standing posture, diseases of the liver, worms, the\r\nwearing of tight corsets, eating highly seasoned or indigestible food,\r\nand the use of alcoholic stimulants. No age is exempt from piles, nor is\r\nthe disease peculiar to either sex. Aside from the serious inconvenience\r\nand pain which are experienced with most forms of piles, there is a\r\ntendency to fistula, and to cancer in the rectal region. It is\r\nimportant, therefore, that the disease should not be allowed to run on\r\nunchecked.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.\r\nPiles: internal and protruding. ]\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS. The most common symptoms at first are slight uneasiness, such\r\nas a little soreness or itching at the verge of the anus, and at times\r\nlancinating pains. These sensations are more severe as a rule if the\r\nbowels are constipated. If the piles are external they frequently become\r\ninflamed, swollen and painful, and in some instances they suppurate,\r\nwhich usually results in relief. When internal piles have increased to\r\nany considerable extent, or have become inflamed, they produce not only\r\nitching at the extremity of the bowel, pain in the back, etc., but also\r\na sensation of fullness in the rectum, as though some foreign body were\r\npresent, and, on action of the bowels, there is a sensation as though a\r\nportion of the fæces had not been expelled. When the internal piles\r\nbecome large, they frequently come down with fæcal matter from the\r\nbowel, as illustrated in Fig. 2, and this prolapsus becomes more and\r\nmore marked with the progress of the disease, until, in many cases, the\r\ntumors are forced down at each action of the bowels, causing\r\nexcruciating pain until they are properly replaced. Usually, in the\r\nearly stages, they recede spontaneously; however, after a time it\r\nbecomes necessary for the sufferer to press them back, but in some\r\ninstances this is impossible. Frequently during the protrusion one of\r\nthe hemorrhoidal veins gives away, and this is followed by a free escape\r\nof blood, and ulceration may ensue. Not infrequently with this disease\r\nthe patient loses strength and flesh, and the face becomes pale and\r\npuffy, assuming a waxy appearance. Many times there is nausea, with\r\nvertigo. Is consequence of the relaxation, the bowel may descend when on\r\nthe feet, or with some extra muscular effort, especially when stooping.\r\nThese symptoms may not all be present in one person, and, indeed,\r\nsometimes are somewhat obscure; when such is the case, an examination by\r\na competent physician will always determine the true character of the\r\ncomplaint at once.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.\r\nH. _i._ Internal hemorrhoidal veins. H. _m._ Middle\r\nhemorrhoidal veins. H. _e._ External hemorrhoidal\r\nveins. S. _i._ Internal sphincter muscle, S. _e._ External\r\nsphincter muscle. ]\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. Notwithstanding the well established fact that piles are\r\nreadily cured by the appropriate treatment, hundreds of thousands of\r\npeople suffer untold tortures from them because of the popular\r\nimpression that they cannot be cured. All cases are not, however,\r\namenable to the same form of treatment, for various unhealthy conditions\r\nof the system are often concerned in their production and perpetuation,\r\nand must, of necessity, be remedied by appropriate treatment, before a\r\ncure of the piles can be expected. It will, therefore, become apparent\r\nthat the avoidance of causes is of paramount importance. Some of these\r\ncauses are external, and wholly under the control of the patient, while\r\nothers depend upon diseases that are curable; it frequently happens that\r\nwhile other diseases are being remedied, the piles disappear Without any\r\nspecial attention.\r\n\r\nDiseases of the urinary apparatus, as stricture of the urethra,\r\nenlargement of the prostate gland, and stone in the bladder, dysentery,\r\ndiarrhea, and constipation,--all cause piles, by the irritation, and\r\ndetermination of blood, which they induce; these difficulties must be\r\nremoved by appropriate treatment.\r\n\r\nSome years since, we ascertained that we were using in our practice\r\nremedies which, in addition to other virtues, possessed a direct\r\nspecific influence upon the vessels concerned in the formation of piles.\r\nThese agents enter into the composition of Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical\r\nDiscovery, which, consequently, will be found exceedingly efficacious in\r\nthe treatment of this disease. This remedy, therefore, in removing the\r\ndisease upon which the piles depend, as a congested or torpid liver,\r\nconstipation, etc., and in exciting a direct curative control over the\r\npiles themselves, exerts a double influence. It may be aided, when the\r\nbowels are badly constipated, by the use of Dr. Pierce's Pleasant\r\nPellets, taken in the morning, to secure a regular and easy evacuation\r\nof the bowels each day. All stimulating food and alcoholic drinks should\r\nbe abstained from. The cold bath is beneficial in these cases, provided\r\nthere is not great debility. The affected parts should be bathed\r\nfrequently with cold water, and, if prolapsus exists, it is well to\r\ninject a little cool water into the rectum, and allow it to remain a few\r\nminutes. As a soothing, astringing and healing application to the\r\naffected parts we prepare an Ointment that has acquired great fame for\r\nthe prompt relief which it affords in all ordinary cases. This we do not\r\nsell through druggists but can send by mail, on receipt of price, $1.00\r\nper large box, postage prepaid. The persistent use of this Ointment, at\r\nthe same time keeping the bowels regular by the use of \"Golden Medical\r\nDiscovery,\" with an occasional laxative dose of \"Pellets,\" will\r\ngenerally cure all ordinary cases of piles.\r\n\r\nTHE RADICAL CURE OF LARGE PILE TUMORS. In cases in which the tumors have\r\nbecome indurated and very large it is impossible to effect cures by the\r\nforegoing or any other medical treatment. Various methods have been in\r\nuse by the profession for the relief of the most severe cases. The most\r\ncommon is excision with the knife or scissors. Reference to the large\r\nvessels, shown in Fig. 3, which are affected in this disease, will at\r\nonce show the sufferer the dangers of this method. The sudden removal of\r\na tumor, which is connected with one or more of the large hemorrhoidal\r\nveins, is sure to be followed by severe hemorrhage, and many times\r\npainful ulceration, and a fatal result. To avoid this it has been the\r\npractice of many physicians to apply caustics or to burn off the base of\r\nthe tumors with a red-hot iron. A more barbarous and painful method\r\ncould not be devised. When it is considered that in many cases, this\r\nsevere and painful treatment is followed by ulceration, and occasionally\r\nby the developement of cancer, the matter should be carefully weighed\r\nbefore any such dangerous procedure is attempted. Another common method\r\nof treatment is to crush the base of the pile with a clamp, and then cut\r\noff the tumors with scissors. After this it is also necessary to apply\r\nthe hot iron to prevent hemorrhage. Formerly, applications of nitric\r\nacid were in common use by physicians as a means of cure, but it was\r\nfound that while this treatment would give temporary relief, yet in no\r\nsevere case would it effect a cure. By what we term palliative treatment\r\nalone more cures are effected than by the old process of treatment with\r\nnitric acid. Still another form of treatment is strangulation of the\r\npile by means of a ligature, and this is often more painful than the\r\napplication of hot irons, inasmuch as in cutting off the return flow of\r\nblood from the piles, a large tumor is left for days fully distended and\r\nextremely painful. It does not slough off for a considerable time, and\r\nwe have seen the strongest men suffer intensely, to whom the use of\r\nscissors in removing the tumors was a positive relief in comparison with\r\nthe torture of the ligature. A treatment that has been highly\r\nrecommended by some physicians and condemned by others, is the process\r\nof injection with carbolic acid. This method of treatment is not very\r\npainful but, unfortunately, it is dangerous. The injection of the tumors\r\nwith a fluid which causes coagulation of the blood, and which does not\r\ncompletely shut off the return current of the circulation through the\r\ntumors, has proved fatal in a small percentage of cases. The clots which\r\nare formed by this treatment become detached and are carried into the\r\ngeneral circulation and conveyed to the liver, lungs and even to the\r\nbrain, where, by plugging up the vessels of those organs, they cause\r\nabscesses which terminate life. Serious inflammation of the veins is\r\nanother accident which often follows the injection of carbolic acid.\r\nThis treatment is, therefore, now seldom resorted to except by\r\nphysicians who do not appreciate its dangers.\r\n\r\nA MORE SUCCESSFUL METHOD. Fortunately for suffering humanity, a method\r\nof treatment has been perfected and thoroughly tested in our\r\ninstitution, in which all such trouble and danger as above described are\r\navoided. This consists in bringing down the tumors, cleansing them and\r\nmaking application, of certain chemical preparations, that cause the\r\ntumors to speedily shrivel up, and in a very short time, say ten to\r\nfourteen days, disappear entirely. These treatments and applications\r\ncause _no pain whatever_, for by first applying a weak solution of\r\ncocaine to the parts they are speedily rendered entirely insensible, so\r\nthat the most sensitive, nervous lady experiences not the slightest\r\nsuffering from the application of our remedies.\r\n\r\nHaving now at our command means so positively certain in their action\r\nupon pile tumors, we do not hesitate to say that the very worst cases,\r\nno matter of how long standing, can be promptly cured, if we can only\r\nhave the patient for a few days under our personal care. Considering the\r\nvery distressing character of pile tumors, it is a great boon that we\r\nhave at last found safe, painless, and positively certain means for\r\ntheir cure. The news will be hailed with joy by a large class of\r\nsufferers.\r\n\r\nProbably no other discovery in modern science is destined to be the\r\nmeans of conferring greater blessings on a large class of sufferers than\r\nthat of a painless and positive method of curing the largest pile tumors\r\nin the brief time required by our system of treating them.\r\n\r\nIt seems to us that there is no longer an excuse for any one to endure\r\nthe tortures inflicted by pile tumors, provided the afflicted one can\r\ncommand the little time and moderate amount of means necessary to secure\r\nthe treatment indicated. Piles are not only in and of themselves very\r\npainful and annoying, but often greatly aggravate and even cause other\r\ngrave and painful affections, and should, therefore, not be neglected.\r\nWhen large, they never get well without proper treatment. We have seen\r\nmany cases in which the long train of diverse and distressing symptoms\r\ncaused by piles led the sufferer, and even the family physician, to\r\nsuppose that other diseases existed, but all of which annoying symptoms\r\nwere speedily dispelled by the cure of the piles. We have no doubt that\r\nneglected piles, fistulæ, and other morbid conditions of the lower\r\nbowels, frequently degenerate into cancerous disease. We have the\r\neminent authority of J. Hughes Bennett, of Edinburg, and many other\r\nclose observers, for saying that benign or ordinary tumors often\r\ndegenerate into real cancerous disease, and our own extensive\r\nobservation convinces us that this is not infrequently a result of\r\nneglected rectal disease, as piles, fistulæ and fissures. How important,\r\nthen, to give prompt attention and skillful treatment to disease of\r\nthese parts. When the ordinary palliative treatment, with ointments and\r\nwith laxative agents to keep the bowels soluble, does not _completely\r\nand perfectly_ subdue the malady, lose no time in securing the most\r\nskillful appliances, that every vestige of the affection may be promptly\r\nremoved. We have treated many thousands of cases with uniform success,\r\nand our patients write to us expressing the greatest degree of\r\nsatisfaction, and recommending our method most highly.\r\n\r\nReports of a few cases, selected at random from the large number which\r\nwe have cured, are given below to illustrate our success in curing them.\r\n\r\n\r\nANAL FISTULA. (FISTULA IN ANO.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis disease is _more dangerous_ than piles, though, after once formed,\r\nnot so painful. It sometimes commences with intense itching about the\r\nanus, accompanied with a little discharge; or the first symptom may be a\r\npainful abscess, like a boil, which finally breaks. The soreness then in\r\na measure subsides, leaving a fistulous opening, with a continuous\r\ndischarge of matter. This unnatural opening, with its constant drain\r\nupon the system, sooner or later is certain to ruin the health or\r\ndevelop consumption or other maladies, and destroy life.\r\n\r\nFistula in Ano may exist in three conditions: First, complete\r\nfistula--when the opening is continuous from the cavity of the rectum or\r\nbowel to the surface of the skin, so that liquids, gases, etc., escape;\r\nsecondly, internal incomplete fistula, when the opening extends from the\r\ninside of the rectum into the tissues surrounding it, but not through\r\nthe skin. A few cases of this kind exist, while the sufferers are\r\nunconscious of the nature of the difficulty, supposing it to be piles or\r\nsome trouble--they know not what. Thirdly, external, incomplete fistula,\r\nwhen the opening extends through the skin into the tissues around the\r\nrectum, but does not enter the bowel.\r\n\r\nOther complications, such as pendulous tits or projections, from\r\none-fourth to one and a half inches in length, are attendant upon\r\nfistula. Two or more openings may appear in the skin, all communicating\r\nwith the same sinus, or opening into the rectum. Sometimes only a small\r\nexternal opening is seen, while a large abscess exists internally. In\r\nany case, the discharge is not only reducing to the system, but it is\r\ndisgusting and offensive.\r\n\r\nCAUSES The causes are a constitutional predisposition, constipation,\r\npiles, or the presence of foreign bodies in the rectum, causing an\r\nabscess or ulcer. Some authors have contended that fistula always\r\noriginates from an ulcer in the rectum, which gradually makes its way\r\nthrough the cellular tissue to the surface. Others contend that the\r\ncause of this disease consists in an abscess, which burrows in the\r\ntissues and makes its exit into the rectum, or through the skin, or\r\nboth. No doubt it may originate in both ways. It can readily be seen\r\nthat when an internal opening is once established, the _foeces_ which\r\nenter into it must sooner or later work their way to the surface,\r\nburrowing through those parts which offer the least resistance, until a\r\nplace of exit is reached.\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSIS. The disease may be suspected, if there has been an abscess in\r\nthe parts involved, or if the patient has been subject to pain in the\r\nrectum, and the parts are tender, tumid, or indurated. When the fistula\r\nopens externally, the linen will be moistened and soiled with pus, or a\r\nbloody fluid, and when the tract is large, the _foeces_ may pass through\r\nit. A careful exploration with a probe, passed into the external opening\r\nwhile the finger is in the rectum, generally reveals the direction of\r\nthe tract; but, sometimes, in consequence of the tortuous course of the\r\ncanal, the probe cannot he made to follow it. When the fistula is\r\nincomplete, and opens internally, the probe is passed into the rectum\r\nand directed outwards, when it may be felt externally. In such cases, a\r\ntumor, caused by the contents of the fistula, may generally be seen\r\nprotruding near the anus, and the pain will be considerably increased\r\nduring defecation, by the _foeces_ passing into it and disturbing its\r\nwalls. The examination should be made with the greatest possible care,\r\nfor it is attended with more or less pain.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. When constitutional derangement exists, it must be rectified,\r\nor any treatment will be liable to result in failure. The comfort of the\r\npatient may be greatly promoted by attention to the bowels, keeping\r\ntheir contents in a soluble condition, and the liver active, so as to\r\nprevent congestion of the rectum and adjacent structures. This can best\r\nbe done by careful attention to hygiene, and the use of \"Golden Medical\r\nDiscovery\" and \"Pellets,\" in sufficient quantities to produce the above\r\nnamed effects.\r\n\r\nA _radical cure_, however, cannot be accomplished except by surgical\r\nmeans, for which we have the _knife, ligature, caustic, stimulating\r\ninjections, etc.,_ which may be varied to suit the emergency, but which\r\nshould never be employed except by a competent surgeon. Constitutional\r\nconditions materially influence the cure, no matter what procedure is\r\nadopted; the greater the constitutional derangement and the poorer the\r\ngeneral health, the longer is the cure delayed. The great secret of our\r\nsuccess in treating this disease consists in applying appropriate\r\nconstitutional treatment at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe use of the knife is becoming obsolete, and has, to a great extent,\r\ngiven way to other measures which are equally successful. Indeed, other\r\nmeans will succeed in cases in which the knife fails or is for any\r\nreason inapplicable. One great objection to the knife is not only the\r\ndread which patients entertain of it, but the great liability of its use\r\nto result in paralysis of the sphincters of the anus, the consequence of\r\nwhich is loss of control over the bowels; and another is that it\r\nsometimes entirely fails to result in cure. By the means which we\r\nemploy, these objections are entirely overcome, and, while the general\r\nsystem is being renovated, the fistula is healed, without any\r\ncomplications.\r\n\r\nFistula is much more common than has generally been supposed. It is apt\r\nto be associated with pulmonary diseases. Heretofore, it has been\r\nsupposed that to heal the fistula, during the progress of the lung\r\naffection, would result in fatal consequences, and the patient has been\r\nleft to suffer and die under the combined influence, of the _two_\r\ndiseases. Observation, based upon an extensive experience in the\r\nmanagement of such diseases, has proved that supposition to be\r\nfallacious in every respect, and we would urge all persons afflicted\r\nwith fistula to have the affliction cured, no matter what complications\r\nmay exist. The fact underlying this erroneous opinion is, that when\r\ngrave constitutional troubles have co-existed the use of the knife has\r\nresulted in failure, and the fistula has refused to heal.\r\n\r\nHaving had ample facilities for observing the relative merits of the\r\nvarious methods of treating this complaint, in hundreds of eases, in our\r\nown practice and that of others, we feel justified in saying that the\r\nplan which we have adopted is far superior to that in general use. The\r\nlocal treatment which we employ depends upon the nature of the fistula;\r\nin some instances the ligature is best, in others caustics, and again\r\ninjection, etc., while still others require a combination of two or more\r\nmethods, or a modification of them.\r\n\r\nIn cases in which it is impossible for the patient to come to our hotel\r\nfor a radical and speedy cure of the fistula, we employ constitutional\r\ntreatment, with, the use of a medicated crayon, which is similar in\r\nshape to a small slate pencil. This crayon is made of gelatine with the\r\nremedial agents thoroughly incorporated through it, and in an easily\r\nsoluble form. They are very flexible and readily used, and where the\r\nfistulous track is sufficiently large to admit of their insertion, the\r\nmost decided improvement invariable follows their application. One is\r\noiled and gently introduced into the track every two or three days, and\r\nby its solution the unhealthy tissues which line the track are removed.\r\nThey are thrown off, and a healthy action is induced. With careful\r\nconstitutional treatment, decided improvement soon follows, and the\r\ndischarge is gradually lessened. The most satisfactory improvement\r\noccurs in the general health and strength of the patient, and gradually\r\nthe fistula closes. Sometimes it is necessary to pursue this course of\r\ntreatment for many months, but the result obtained is sufficient reward\r\nfor the trouble. A large percentage of cures follow this treatment, and\r\nwe recommend it when it is impossible for the patient to leave home, or\r\nwhen the general health is greatly reduced by severe constitutional\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONIALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile we have a great cloud of witnesses testifying to the efficacy of\r\nour treatment of the diseases described in this volume, yet for lack of\r\nspace we can here introduce only the few following:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"LIVER COMPLAINT.\"\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: J.H. May, Esq. ]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--In the year 1889 I was taken with disease which the doctors\r\ncalled \"liver complaint.\" I tried three different doctors. They did me\r\nno good. They tried about one year; I was not able to work for two\r\nyears. At last I thought I would try Dr. Pierce's medicines, and I wrote\r\nto Dr. Pierce, and he wrote to me to take his \"Golden Medical\r\nDiscovery,\" and I bought two bottles, and when I took it, I saw it was\r\nimproving me, and I got five more, and before I had taken all I was\r\nwell, and I haven't felt the symptoms since. I had a continued hurting\r\nin my bowels for about two years. I feel as if the cure is worth\r\nthousands of dollars to me.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly,\r\n    J.H.

I suffered a great deal of pain at each monthly\r\nperiod. I took one bottle and a half of the \"Favorite Prescription,\" one\r\nteaspoonful three times a day, and the \"Pellets\" as directions called\r\nfor. I gained in health and strength so rapidly that I have been able to\r\nwork very hard the past summer, and my back never troubles me; and when\r\nI have my monthly periods I never feel the least bit of pain.

I had heard of\r\nDr. Pierce's medicines doing a good deal of good, so I made up my mind\r\nto try them. I sent and got one bottle of \"Favorite Prescription\" and\r\none bottle of \"Golden Medical Discovery\"; also one bottle of \"Pellets,\"\r\nand commenced taking them. In a few days I commenced to gain, and In two\r\nweeks' time I could sit up most all day, and in five weeks' time I could\r\ndo my work with the help of two small girls.

Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mrs. Dennis. ]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--About two years ago I was confined to my bed for several\r\nweeks with liver complaint. I became dropsical, my limbs swelled to\r\ntwice their usual size and I could scarcely move them. I commenced using\r\nDr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery; one bottle helped me so I could\r\nsit up; two bottles gave me strength enough to be able to do part of my\r\nhousehold work; six bottles cured me, and to-day I am enjoying good\r\nhealth. The \"Medical Discovery\" should be in every household, and in\r\ngratitude for what it has done for me I have recommended it to many\r\nfriends. For nine years I have suffered from deafness, and while taking\r\nthe \"Discovery\" my hearing became much improved.\r\n\r\n    Very truly yours,\r\n    MRS. I.C. DENNIS,\r\n    Burson.

My digestion was improved greatly, so that little\r\ntrouble is experienced after eating; my liver seems to act reasonable\r\nwell, and my bowels are much better. My varicocele I consider entirely\r\ncured, as I have not used the bandage for one half day for more than six\r\nmonths, and do not experience any inconvenience from that source.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly,\r\n    HARLAN HODGES,\r\n    Keota, Keokuk Co., Is.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASE OF CHRONIC DIARRHEA CURED BY HOME TREATMENT.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mrs. Gwin. ]\r\n\r\nAt the time the case was first submitted to us the bowels were moving\r\nsix or eight times a day. In addition to the diarrhea, the patient had\r\nsuffered from indigestion and womb trouble for eight years. There was\r\nalmost continual pain from the top of the head to the hips and through\r\nthe shoulders. There was weakness, soreness and numbness in the arms,\r\nhands, back and hips; the bladder was irritable, urine being passed\r\nfrequently, or occasionally scanty, dark, thick, with a brick-dust\r\ndeposit. There was a dragging sensation in the region of the womb.\r\nMenstruation was irregular, and she had frequent trembling spells\r\nlasting for hours. There was difficulty in fixing the attention, even\r\nfor a sufficient length of time to write a brief letter. In fact, she\r\nwas so weak and nervous she could scarcely write at all. Sleeplessness\r\nwas a prominent feature of the case. The principal diet consisted of\r\nlight bread and hot milk; could not use Graham bread. A course of\r\nspecial treatment was supplied to her about the first of January, 1890,\r\nbut soon after commencing the treatment she had an attack of pneumonia.\r\nIn due time the treatment was resumed, and then followed an attack of\r\nthe epidemic influenza, or grip, so that, although the treatment was\r\ncarried on at intervals during a year, there were but few occasions when\r\nour specialist had what he considered full control of the case. A year\r\nafter the case was discharged the following communication was received:\r\n\r\n\r\nFebruary 15, 1893.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--I should have written sooner, but I waited to see if there\r\nwould be any return of my old disease. After suffering over eight years\r\nwith severe chronic diarrhea, you have cured me; I have had no return of\r\nit for over a year. It is with gratitude I write to you to tell you the\r\ngreat good you have done me, for I am sure I would have been in my grave\r\nbefore this had it not been for your treatment; My stomach troubles me\r\nvery little any more. Occasionally I use a bottle of \"Golden Medical\r\nDiscovery\" and a bottle of \"Pellets.\" Hoping that the kind Father may\r\nspare your lives for many years to do good to suffering humanity,\r\n\r\n    I am, Very gratefully yours,\r\n    MRS.

I had feared that my health was gradually being undermined,\r\nprior to entering your institution, and I can testify to the perfect\r\nappointment that you have, the excellent apparatus for the\r\nadministration of electrical and other massage treatment and baths. My\r\nrelief was most satisfactory, and the cure has remained permanent.\r\n\r\nI take pleasure in recommending your institution to the afflicted,\r\nbelieving that you have the very best treatment for chronic diseases\r\nknown, and I have had an opportunity to satisfy myself, from\r\nconversation with other invalids in your Institution, of the care and\r\nskillful treatment that you administer, and its excellent effects.

I am now\r\nseventy-three years of age, and enjoy very good health for my years, and\r\nas you can see by the photograph I send you, time has dealt very\r\nconsiderately with me so far as my activity and enjoyment of life are\r\nconcerned. To this I feel that in large measure my thanks are due to\r\nyou, for eleven years ago when I was sixty-two years of age you treated\r\nthe pile tumors so successfully. They had been the source of greatest\r\ndiscomfort. I think that they were caused first by chronic diarrhea,\r\nwhich had troubled me many years prior to their appearance. I was also\r\nafflicted with asthma, torpid liver and constipation. These conditions\r\nproduced in time some pile tumors that were the source of much\r\nsuffering, and seemed to continually annoy me. As is usual with such\r\ndifficulties, I believe, I would be free from discomfort for a time, and\r\nthen the piles would get sensitive and irritable, come down at stool,\r\nand gave rise to severe pain that seemed to affect my general health.\r\nThe nervous symptoms that resulted from their presence were such as to\r\nlead me to fear that I would break down in health unless they were\r\nrelieved. From information obtained from others who had been relieved at\r\nyour hands, I applied to your institution, and can thankfully assert\r\nthat the tumors were permanently cured, as it has been eleven years\r\nsince your specialist treated me, and I have had no trouble of the kind,\r\nand for an old lady I am pretty well. I had such good treatment and nice\r\ncare at your institution that I cannot express in my testimony the\r\nthanks that I owe you. Wishing you every success in the treatment of\r\nothers, and that you may be able to relieve the sufferings of many\r\nhundreds as you have mine,\r\n\r\n    I remain.

I would take some\r\nbitters, which would help to move the matter, but as soon as the bitters\r\nwere gone, I had to buy more or I would be as bad as before, and\r\nsometimes worse; but none of them appeared to do me any good except to\r\nmove the bowels, until thirty years since a druggist called my attention\r\nto your \"Golden Medical Discovery,\" and before I had taken half a bottle\r\nof the \"Golden Medical Discovery,\" I felt much better, and by the time I\r\nhad taken all, I could eat three hearty meals per day and had not felt\r\nso well for a long time. Soon after I was called to do a job some miles\r\nfrom home, and one night the old lady there was speaking about her\r\ndaughter (Mrs. Brooks) who had been under the doctor's care for about\r\nfive months and did not get any better, and I learned by asking a few\r\nquestions that she had no appetite and no ambition to do anything. Then\r\nI told her what the \"Golden Medical Discovery\" had done for me. The next\r\nday the old lady drove down to her daughter's and got Mr. Brooks to send\r\nto Rutland, ten miles away, for two bottles of the \"Golden Medical\r\nDiscovery,\" and the next day when the doctor came and was about to take\r\nhis leave, Mr. Brooks told the doctor he did not want him any more at\r\npresent, and would send for him, if necessary. I saw the old lady about\r\nten days later and her daughter was improving, and Mr. Brooks had great\r\nfaith in the \"Golden Medical Discovery,\" and had not sent for the\r\ndoctor, but had gone to Rutland for more of the \"Golden Medical\r\nDiscovery.\" When I commenced taking the \"Golden Medical Discovery\" I\r\nthought I was going into consumption, as I had a cough for three years\r\nor more and my weight decreasing. My weight before taking the \"Golden\r\nMedical Discovery\" was 133 pounds; last March it was 147 pounds, and I\r\ngive the credit to the \"Discovery,\"\r\n\r\n    GEORGE I.

Not one moment\r\nduring that time had I rest from pain or weakness. I consulted six of\r\nour best physicians, taking medicines from each for a good long time. I\r\nbecame completely discouraged, as I had been many times before. A letter\r\nfrom the World's Dispensary Medical Association with questions to be\r\nanswered, fell into my hands; these I carefully answered. As soon as a\r\nletter could go and come I received another saying I had the Liver\r\nDisease. I could hardly believe it, for it had never entered my mind\r\nthat that was my trouble. I read the pamphlet sent me in the next mail,\r\ndescribing my feelings much better than I could myself. I accepted their\r\nadvice, strictly followed it. I found complete relief in taking the\r\n\"Golden Medical Discovery.\" For years I could not ride a mile nor walk\r\nto my nearest neighbor's without feeling worse for it, and most of the\r\ntime could not go at all. The day this picture was taken I rode eighteen\r\nmiles, walking up and down two long hills. To the afflicted and\r\ndiscouraged I would say consult the World's Dispensary Medical\r\nAssociation; accept their advice, strictly follow it, and if there be\r\nhelp for you I believe you will find it in so doing.\r\n\r\n    Respectfully yours,\r\n    MRS.

I suffered terribly from \"heart-burn,\" had bad coat on\r\ntongue, and was often troubled with diarrhea. Three bottles of the\r\n\"Discovery\" cured me.

I also had such a dead aching\r\nin the small of my back; it just felt as if I would break, and such\r\naching between my hips. I had been having the \"change of life,\" and if I\r\nworked hard I got a pain between my shoulders and a kind of aching in\r\nthe abdomen. I doctored a good deal and never got any relief. I was very\r\nnervous. I took two bottles of Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery and\r\ntwo of his \"Favorite Prescription,\" and I am perfectly cured.\r\n\r\n    MRS.

She was in poor health for a long time, coughing\r\nand weak, and thought she had consumption; she had such palpitation of\r\nthe heart and could not rest at night because of the palpitation\r\nsometimes, and then the right arm pained her so at times that she hardly\r\nknew what to do; If we would put on hot applications, it would drive it\r\nto the heart, and the doctor did her no good; so finally, as a last\r\nresort, we happened to get hold of some of Dr. Pierce's pamphlets and\r\nwere constrained to write to him and send a small bottle of urine for\r\nexamination. He immediately wrote back, saying it was liver trouble, and\r\nto take the \"Golden Medical Discovery\" according to directions. She took\r\nit for two months, when the pain in her arm gradually left her and she\r\ncould comb her own hair, and began to be more cheerful, for she was\r\nmelancholy before. The palpitation grew less and less, and she rested at\r\nnight, and is now doing her own work for a family of five, and is\r\nsixty-one years old.\r\n\r\nI have taken delight in recommending to others this wonderful medicine\r\nfor heart and liver trouble; she took a dozen bottles to effect the\r\ndesired end.\r\n\r\n    Respectfully yours,\r\n    Miss LU WINTER,\r\n    Dakota, Winona Co., Minn.\r\n\r\n\r\nTORPID LIVER, SUPPRESSED MENSTRUATION.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mrs. Fitzgerald. ]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--I had suffered so much for years from \"Liver Complaint\"\r\nthat I did not care whether I got well or not, but my husband urged me\r\nto take your \"Golden Medical Discovery.\" I had not had my courses for\r\nsix months; after I had taken your medicine about two months, I was\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nWhen one of my daughters with a baby two weeks old was in so much pain\r\nthat she could not rest day or night, I went to her as quickly as I\r\ncould, and commenced giving her your \"Favorite Prescription.\" The next\r\nmorning the pains were all gone. She said, \"oh, mother, I would have\r\ndied if you had not come. I do feel so good.\" Your medicine makes people\r\nfeel like they wanted to live. There is a woman at Verdi who had several\r\nchildren who died with consumption of the bowels and _chronic diarrhea_.\r\nShe had another one who was going the same way. The doctor said it was\r\nbound to die. I went there and gave it five drops of Dr. Pierce's\r\nExtract of Smart-Weed, and increased the dose every time its bowels\r\nmoved, until I got to a half teaspoonful. The next morning the child was\r\nalmost well. That woman says I saved her baby's life.\r\n\r\nI could write a week and not tell half the good your medicines have done\r\nthrough my hands. Two weeks ago, a young man at my house was taken with\r\n_cholera morbus_. He thought he was surely going to die, but as quickly\r\nas I could get some hot water, I put hot applications on his stomach and\r\nbowels, and gave him a few doses of your Extract of Smart-Weed. He got\r\nwell immediately. MRS. MARY ISABELL FITZGERALD.

By the time I had taken a bottle and a half of\r\nDr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery, the bleeding had almost stopped.\r\nMy appetite was good, nothing seemed to hurt me that I ate. My\r\nimprovement was wonderful. Several years have passed and my cure is\r\npermanent.\r\n\r\n    Yours respectfully,\r\n    Mrs. AURELIA VANZILE,\r\n    Hamilton, Ind.\r\n\r\n\r\nBILIOUS ATTACKS.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: I.C. Seely, Esq.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--Nine years ago I was taken with severe pains in my stomach\r\nand bowels which the usual home remedies failed to relieve; after\r\nseveral days it passed off, leaving me very sore and weak but in the\r\ncourse of a few weeks it came on again. I called in a doctor--he treated\r\nme for biliousness; I occasionally went several months without any\r\nattack and then it would come more severe than ever; I could scarcely\r\nbear the weight of my clothes on my stomach and bowels. I grew thin,\r\nweak and despondent,--could do no work without bringing on terrible\r\npain. Doctors treated me for catarrh of the head and stomach,\r\nindigestion, dyspepsia, but all was of no avail; the suffering gradually\r\nincreased in severity and I despaired of any relief.\r\n\r\nIn 1892 I had a spell that was so severe I cramped from feet to neck.\r\nThe Doctor said I must die--he couldn't do any thing for me. After about\r\nfive weeks in bed I could again sit up, but the pain had settled in my\r\nright groin and limb. Relatives persuaded me to try \"Golden Medical\r\nDiscovery.\" Two thirds of the bottle was gone when I felt a change for\r\nthe better; I had one very light attack after the first bottle; that has\r\nbeen seventeen months ago and I have had no more trouble. I have taken\r\nten bottles of Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery and I am now well\r\nand able to support my family.\r\n\r\nTo any one with stomach and bowel trouble I will recommend Dr. Pierce's\r\nMedicine. I am never without it in the house.\r\n\r\n    I remain, yours,\r\n    I.C. SEELY, Lindsborg,\r\n    McPherson Co., Kans.\r\n\r\n\r\nDYSPEPSIA--CONSTIPATION.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, 653 Main St., Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mrs. A.L. Pierce.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--Three years ago I was suffering from constipation, distress\r\nin the stomach, bowels, feet and ankles bloated, kidney and heart\r\ntrouble, loss of appetite, bad taste in the mouth, sour risings in the\r\nstomach, and indigestion. I was under the treatment of three physicians\r\nseven months. One gave me up to die. This was my condition when I was\r\nprevailed upon to take Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery and\r\n\"Pleasant Pellets.\" I am well, your medicines have cured me permanently.\r\nHad I the power and language to herald to the whole world the good\r\nqualities of your medicines, I would most gladly do so, as they have\r\nsaved my life and brought health and happiness to me.\r\n\r\n    Yours most sincerely,\r\n    MRS.

They\r\nrecommended me to take Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery, which I\r\ndid, and after using two bottles my trouble entirely disappeared.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGAINED THIRTEEN POUNDS; CATARRH OF STOMACH.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mrs. Powell. ]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--Two years ago I was pale and emaciated, food fermented in\r\nmy stomach. A physician pronounced my case \"Catarrh of the Stomach,\" but\r\nhe could not help me. I lived a month without solid food and when I\r\ntried to eat I would vomit. At this time I began taking Dr. Pierce's\r\nPleasant Pellets, and in two weeks I was decidedly better. I am now in\r\ngood health, and never felt better in my life.

I was so run down that I could not go to school, and,\r\nas the various remedies I tried did me no good, I applied to you, and\r\nwas advised to try a course of special treatment. After taking only two\r\nmonths' medicines from your noble institution, I feel perfectly restored\r\nto health. I have, moreover, recovered my lost flesh, and I am pleased\r\nto say need no further medicines.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly,\r\n    E.A.

Hall, Esq. ]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--I am happy to say that your valuable medicine has been a\r\ngreat benefit to me. I was suffering from general debility, malaria and\r\nnervous sick headaches, and after my third child was born (a beautiful\r\nbaby boy of ten pounds) I only recovered after a long illness; I barely\r\ngained strength enough in two years' time so that I was able to crawl\r\nabout to accomplish the little housework that I had, by lying down to\r\nread many times each day; had sick headaches very often; and many pains\r\nand aches, all the time complaining of getting no better. I finally\r\nasked my husband to get a bottle of Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription,\r\nwhich he promptly did. After I had taken one bottle I could see a great\r\nchange in my strength, and fewer sick headaches.\r\n\r\nI continued taking the medicine until I had taken eight bottles--seven\r\nof the \"Favorite Prescription\" and one of the \"Golden Medical\r\nDiscovery.\" For some time past I have not used it, but I am now able to\r\ndo the housework for myself, husband and two children (aged nine and\r\nfive years). I also take in dressmaking, and enjoy walking a mile at a\r\ntime, and I think it is all due to the medicine, for I know I was only\r\nfailing fast before I commenced to take it. I take great pleasure in\r\nrecommending the \"Favorite Prescription\" to all women who suffer from\r\ndebility and sick headache.\r\n\r\n    Respectfully yours, MRS. J.H.

Our family doctor was tending her twice a day; she\r\ngot no better; I sent unbeknown to the doctor and got one bottle of Dr.\r\nPierce's Pellets, and one bottle of his \"Golden Medical Discovery,\" and\r\ncommenced to give them to her as directed; after taking the medicine\r\nthree days, the fever began to go down, and the doctor came in and said:\r\n\"what's the matter?\" \"Ida, you have no fever this morning,\" and laughed.\r\nThen I told him I had been giving Dr. Pierce's medicines. He didn't say\r\na word--he was beaten. My oldest daughter is improving by taking Dr.\r\nPierce's Favorite Prescription.\r\n\r\n    Yours respectfully,\r\n    MRS.

Waters, Esq.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--I wish to acknowledge that you have cured me of the worst\r\ndropsy that ever came within my knowledge, it having afflicted me\r\ntwenty-two years. After I had suffered much from other surgeons without\r\nany cure being effected, and with only relief for a short time, you\r\nperformed a not only painless but very scientific operation, and with\r\nmedicine completed the cure. It is now five years since you treated me\r\nand no symptoms of the disease have shown themselves. I will also add\r\nthat while with you at the Invalids' Hotel I received the best of care\r\nand attention from the well trained nurses in your employ, for all of\r\nwhich I feel grateful.\r\n\r\n    With respect and best wishes,\r\n    EDWIN L.

They could not reach my case; I was given up to die; my\r\nsufferings were _indescribable_; I could not retain food on my stomach;\r\ncould not control my bowels at times; suffered great pain; could not\r\nsleep at night; I was reduced to a _skeleton_; in health I weighed 180;\r\nthen only 111; I now weigh as much as I did before I was sick. I am\r\nsixty years old, but feel young and active; I owe it to the medicines\r\nyou sent to me. After taking it two months I was out of bed attending to\r\nmy work; my friends could hardly believe it was I when they would meet\r\nme out away from home. I consider my cure as almost miraculous.\r\n\r\n    Respectfully,\r\n    JOS. T.

After trying different doctors, and many\r\nother remedies for a year, from which I received little or no benefit, I\r\nwas advised to try Dr. Pierce's special treatment, which I did, and\r\nafter two months I was a well, strong, healthy man, and have been ever\r\nsince.\r\n\r\n    Yours, etc.,\r\n    ISAAC G.

I had a rupture of\r\ntwenty-seven years' standing, with hemorrhage of the kidney for six\r\nmonths, preceding my visit to your Institute, and was also troubled\r\nbadly with indigestion, all of which ailments had reduced me in strength\r\nand flesh to a mere skeleton. Had been treated by many local physicians,\r\nwho failed to do me any good. I could walk but a very short distance\r\nwhen I left my home on the 8th of July, 1892, for treatment at your\r\nInstitution, with but little faith or hope of ever being any better. But\r\nthrough your skillful treatment I was able to return to my home on the\r\n9th of August, 1892, and consider myself permanently cured, having had\r\nto take no medicine since. Considering my case _almost a miracle_, I\r\ncannot speak too highly of your Institute and skillful treatment, to\r\nwhich I feel that I am indebted for my continued existence.

I did not suffer much at first--say for the first five\r\nyears; but after that it was continual suffering all the time (and\r\ngrowing worse all the time), until just two years ago, when I completely\r\ncollapsed, and had to give up all thoughts of work. I have not done a\r\nday's work since, but am now ready to go to work again. During the last\r\nfive years I have been doctoring with as many as six different doctors\r\nhere and in San Francisco. I was with one specialist here in my city\r\nfive months, but none of the doctors gave me even temporary relief. The\r\nmain symptoms of my disease were that my food would sour on my stomach\r\nand give me an awful heart-burn.

A pain began in the stomach, a sort of cramp; extended to the\r\nchest, shoulders and arms, also affecting the spinal column opposite the\r\nlocation of pain; had a hard lump that felt like lead in the pit of her\r\nstomach. Pain was brought on sometimes by eating something that at other\r\ntimes she could eat with impunity. Attacks of pain lasted usually about\r\nthree days.

This got to be a\r\ngreat drudge to me. I took treatment from the leading physicians of this\r\npart of the country for my stomach and bowel troubles, and spent over\r\none hundred dollars in this way, but they did me no good whatever. I got\r\nso bad that I began to think my time on earth was short, and did not\r\ncare if I lived or died. I had to stop work; everything was a burden to\r\nme, until at last I tried your Institution.

After taking your special home-treatment for\r\nfive months, I was in the enjoyment of perfect health. This was two\r\nyears ago, and ever since my bowels have moved regularly, and I have not\r\ntaken any medicine to make them move.

Roberts, Esq.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--For more than twelve years I have been a sufferer with a\r\ncomplication of rectal troubles; pile tumors, prolapsus and fistula in\r\nAno. I have been under the treatment of our most skilled practitioners,\r\nby ligature, carbolic acid, constitutional treatment, change of climate\r\nand the celebrated Brinkerhoff treatment, and also tried all of the\r\nlocal guaranteed nostrums, from all of which I have been only\r\ntemporarily relieved. The old troubles would in a short time return, and\r\nwith seemingly renewed vigor. With fast failing health and terrible\r\nnerve prostration, I left home the 1st day of October last, to take a\r\ntwo weeks' trip, hoping for some temporary relief. On the trip I stopped\r\nover at Buffalo, and having several years before been in correspondence\r\nwith the Infirmary, concluded to consult you. I did so with little hope\r\nof a beneficial result. From the manner in which I was received and the\r\nsatisfactory diagnosis of my case, I placed myself under your treatment.\r\nOn the 16th day of October you operated upon me with such complete and\r\nsatisfactory success, that I am now a sound and happy man, and am\r\nconfident that had I been treated by you ten years ago that I would now\r\nbe twenty years younger in feeling and thousands of dollars better off.\r\nIt affords me pleasure, doctors, to recommend the Invalids' Hotel and\r\nSurgical Institute to all of the afflicted, and to assure them of the\r\nmost skillful treatment, honest and polite attention, and with the\r\nassurance of my kindest and most grateful remembrance,\r\n\r\n    I am, Yours truly,\r\n    N.T.

And my troubles are yielding slowly but surely; my general\r\nhealth is better than for twelve years--all of which I owe to Dr.\r\nPierce, and his skillful physicians and surgeons.\r\n\r\nPlease accept my sincere thanks for the kindness shown me while an\r\ninmate by all connected with the Invalids' Hotel. I shall heartily\r\nrecommend your Institution to all sufferers.\r\n\r\n    Yours gratefully,\r\n    MRS. M.B.

My disease was of very long standing and had baffled the\r\nskill of our home physicians. I went to the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical\r\nInstitute, and received treatment of their specialist. Under his\r\nskillful care and kind attention I soon regained my strength and felt\r\nthat my former life and ambition were again restored to me. I cannot\r\nspeak in too high praise of this famous Institution; the rooms are large\r\nand cheerful, the food of the very best, the nurses kind and attentive,\r\nand the staff of physicians and surgeons skillful and of large\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\n    Yours respectfully,\r\n    MRS.

A PROMINENT\r\nMERCHANT TESTIFIES TO THE SUPERIOR METHODS EMPLOYED AT THE INVALIDS'\r\nHOTEL AND SURGICAL INSTITUTE.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: J.F. Saton, Esq. ]\r\n\r\nIt is with pleasure that I testify to the cure of the Fistula, for which\r\nyou treated me. I had suffered from it for a long time, and felt that it\r\nwas likely to seriously undermine my health and poison my system. I had\r\ndeterred having it treated from the fears of the cutting operation in\r\ncommon use by physicians in the large hospitals and by surgeons in\r\ngeneral practice. My fears were grounded on the fatal results that had\r\nfollowed in cases in my knowledge. I am thankful that I placed my case\r\nin the hands of your experienced specialists for treatment. The result\r\nhas been a perfect cure. The treatment of the blood-poison that you gave\r\nme was successful in eliminating it all from my system, and I have since\r\nenjoyed perfect health, and no recurrence whatever of the fistula. It\r\nhas been now many years since I was cured, and I thank you most\r\nsincerely for the good results that were brought about in my case.\r\n\r\nI can recommend your institution as one in which all the requirements of\r\nan invalid are fully met.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly,\r\n    J.F.

Stigers, Esq.]\r\n\r\n_To the afflicted public_:\r\n\r\nIt becomes my pleasant duty to recommend the Invalids' Hotel, Buffalo,\r\nN.Y., as an Institution for the successful treatment of surgical cases\r\nand chronic ailments of every description. It is with especial pleasure\r\nthat I recommend the surgeon-in-chief of the Hotel, who is a skilled\r\nsurgeon, one who stands at the head of the profession. The appointments\r\nof the Hotel are excellent. I was afflicted with an Anal Fistula (a very\r\nbad one it proved to be). I went to the Invalids' Hotel for treatment.\r\nWas placed under the care of your surgeon, who treated my case with such\r\nskill, that the parts are healed soundly. I recommended a friend of\r\nmine, who had a rupture, to go to you for treatment. He did so and was\r\nsoundly healed of his trouble. I will cheerfully answer all\r\ncommunications relative to my stay at the Invalids' Hotel, provided a\r\nstamp is enclosed for return postage.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly,\r\n    M.L.

Johnson, Esq. ]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--I feel that it is my duty to suffering humanity to let them\r\nknow of your great success with me. I had a chronic disease that I had\r\nsuffered with for sixteen years, and last November, owing to a fall, the\r\ndisease doubled on me. I was confined to my bed for months, and the best\r\nsurgeons of our city attended me daily. I continually grew worse. After\r\nconsultation they decided that the knife must be used, which is attended\r\nwith great pain and danger. I wrote you and stated my case; you said you\r\ncould entirely cure me without pain, also without the use of the knife.\r\nI determined to go to Buffalo. Arrived there the 18th of March, and on\r\nthe 20th of April I was at home entirely cured, and have enjoyed better\r\nhealth than for years. You also treated my wife for heart trouble, and\r\ngreatly benefited her. The thoroughness of your methods, preparing the\r\nsystem, etc., greatly adds to your success, as well as your skillful\r\ntreatment. I shall ever hold the surgeons at the Invalids' Hotel and\r\nSurgical Institute as a green spot in my memory.\r\n\r\n    Yours respectfully,\r\n    N.S. JOHNSON, Bloomfield, Iowa.\r\n\r\n\r\nHERNIA AND PILES CURED WITHOUT PAIN.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: J.J. App, Esq.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--I have been successfully treated at your institution for\r\npiles and also rupture of the left side.\r\n\r\nYour institution is all it claims to be, and the treatment of my case\r\nwas accomplished without pain and apparently any risk. Your method of\r\nusing locally cocaine as an anæsthetic is such a decided improvement. I\r\ndid not have to take any dangerous ether or chloroform, but had a small\r\nquantity of medicine injected that made the operation as painless as\r\nthough it was being done on some one else. At the same time I knew\r\neverything and could see what was being done.\r\n\r\nYou have my kindest thanks for the good care and many attentions given\r\nme. Your nurses and physicians all give kind and skillful care.\r\n\r\n    Yours very truly,\r\n    J.J.

Bagley, Esq. ]\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--I was afflicted with piles for many years, brought on by\r\nheavy lifting during the war. My suffering was extreme, and the pile\r\ntumors gradually increased in size, notwithstanding the fact that I\r\ntried many different kinds of treatment. After becoming physically\r\nincapacitated and unable to do any work at all, and after much\r\nhesitation, I visited your institution as the last resort. I am happy to\r\nstate that my visit there has resulted in a complete and permanent cure.\r\nA year or more has now elapsed since I placed myself under the care of\r\nyour specialist, and I wish to thank you most heartily, for the\r\nattention which I received while there, and for the cure which has been\r\naccomplished in my case. I cannot say enough in favor of you and your\r\nstaff of physicians who gave every attention, and whose treatment has\r\nbeen so successful. All suffering has entirely vanished, and I have\r\ngained about 35 pounds in flesh.\r\n\r\n    Respectfully yours,\r\n    J.C. BAGLEY, Watts Flats, Chaut. Co., N.Y.\r\n\r\n\r\nLARGE PILE TUMORS; CHRONIC INFLAMMATION OF BLADDER.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: P. Crump, Esq. ]\r\n\r\nI was troubled with piles for thirty years. These were very mild at\r\nfirst but gradually increased in severity, and I was unable to get\r\nanything which would relieve them. They gradually increased in size, and\r\nfor a good many years past have caused me a great amount of pain. The\r\ntumors became of large size and protruded whenever I lifted anything\r\nheavy or strained in the least; also bled copiously at times. This,\r\ntogether with chronic inflammation of the bladder, with which I have\r\nalso suffered for some years, rendered my life miserable. Physicians at\r\nhome gave up my case as hopeless, and said that they did not think I\r\ncould be benefited, and certainly not cured. I visited your Institution,\r\nhoping to obtain relief, but with very little faith, and am happy to say\r\nthat the treatment which I obtained there has resulted in a permanent\r\ncure of the piles, and the inflammation of the bladder has been so\r\ngreatly relieved that at present I have no suffering of any kind. The\r\ncure is complete and I feel like a new person. In fact I have not\r\nexperienced such comfort in many years. I shall always appreciate the\r\nkindness and attention shown me by your staff of physicians, and also by\r\nthe nurses in your Institution, and shall advise my afflicted friends to\r\nmake you a visit.\r\n\r\n    Very respectfully,\r\n    PETER CRUMP, Dennison, Goodhue Co., Minn.\r\n\r\n\r\nPILE TUMORS.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: S.H. Crosby, Esq. ]\r\n\r\nSince the spring of 1872, I have been troubled with pains in head, the\r\nresult of sun-stroke while in the U.S. army, and pile tumor growth. For\r\nthe last named disease I was treated at the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical\r\nInstitute, in June of 1887, and the growth, as I believe, is killed, and\r\nthe result has been a great benefit to my general health. I am quite\r\ncomfortable and with strength to look after my little work and\r\nsuperintend the same, much better than before treatment, for which\r\nbenefit please accept my thanks.\r\n\r\n    Yours respectfully,\r\n    S.H.

I will say that I am sorry, but I have\r\nhad no photograph of myself taken since I was a child, but will gladly\r\ngive you a testimonial and I will answer by letter any skeptical ones\r\nthat you refer to me, provided they send a return addressed and stamped\r\nenvelope for reply.\r\n\r\nJust one year ago, I was suffering untold agonies from internal piles\r\nand prolapsus of the rectum: my bodily pain was so great that the mental\r\nstrain was almost more than I could stand. I was useless to myself and\r\nfamily and had about persuaded myself it would be better to take my\r\nlife, and I think I should have done so had not a copy of the Common\r\nSense Medical Adviser happened to fall into my hands. I was not certain\r\njust what my trouble was, at least what to call it. I began the Chapter\r\ntreating on Pile Tumors, and then I realized just what my trouble was. I\r\nwrote you and received encouragement. I sent for a month's treatment and\r\nit was certainly the best investment I ever made. I received the\r\nmedicines at noon--read the directions carefully and commenced at once\r\nto carry them out. I seemed better the next day. I suffered less, and in\r\na few days there was a decided change for the better. I continued the\r\nmedicine until I had taken all of it; I have not taken any since, except\r\noccasionally a few of Dr. Pierce's Pellets, just enough to act as a mild\r\nlaxative. I am perfectly well. I was always more or less constipated all\r\nmy life. I now understand that by keeping the bowels open and in good\r\norder, I could have avoided all of the suffering that I have gone\r\nthrough; my friends all think my recovery almost a miracle. I feel, Oh,\r\nso grateful to you, I shall never fail to speak a word in your favor to\r\nsuffering humanity.\r\n\r\n    Respectfully,\r\n    Mrs. J.W.

I state for the\r\nbenefit of all those who may be similarly afflicted that if they will\r\nplace themselves in your hands, you will goon effect radical cures.\r\n\r\n    JOHN J.

I am employed mostly\r\nat my desk, and not infrequently have an attack of the headache. It\r\nusually comes on in the forenoon. At my dinner I eat my regular meal,\r\nand take one or two of Doctor Pierce's Pleasant Pellets immediately\r\nafter, and in the course of an hour my headache is cured and no bad\r\neffects. I feel better every way for having taken them--not worse, as is\r\nusual after taking other kinds of pills. Your \"Pleasant Pellets\" are\r\nworth more than their weight in gold, if for nothing else than to cure\r\nheadache.\r\n\r\n    Very respectfully,\r\n    E.

Bilious attacks were frequent; then my\r\nflesh began stinging and my heart began beating badly and making me so\r\nthat I could not lift a chair, and all together threw me into a cramp\r\nand a numbness, and the family thought I was dying, and sent for another\r\ndoctor who said it was hard to do anything for me; he visited me almost\r\nsix years and did not help me; the pain was so great I had to scream; I\r\nsaid to my doctor, \"can you give me something\" and he said, \"yes, but it\r\nwill not do you any good.\" I told him he had not done me any good in six\r\nyears, and I would quit him. I saw I was almost gone, very pale and weak\r\nand did not eat anything.\r\n\r\nI began your \"Golden Medical Discovery,\" and one-half bottle helped me\r\nso much I began work and improved fast; it helped me so I got 10\r\nbottles. While using them my friends said when I quit I would be just as\r\nbad as ever. It has been five years and no need of a doctor yet, and I\r\nwill say that I think it cannot be beat, and I will still believe in it,\r\nfor if it had not been for the \"Golden Medical Discovery\" I would have\r\nbeen in my grave. Your medicines have helped my brother, and father is\r\nusing it now and it is helping him.\r\n\r\n    I remain. Your true friend,\r\n    Miss C.B.

We had three different doctors to treat him, but he grew steadily\r\nworse. We then commenced giving him Dr. Pierre's Golden Medical\r\nDiscovery, and after using it three days he commenced to improve. Last\r\nsummer he had so fully recovered his health as to make a full hand in\r\nthe harvest field. He took, in all, only six bottles of the \"Golden\r\nMedical Discovery,\" and it saved his life.\r\n\r\n    Respectfully yours,\r\n    J.B. WATRING,\r\n    Lead Mine, Tucker Co., W.

In the Spring\r\nof 1890 I became so exhausted that I was compelled to keep to my bed\r\nwith symptoms of paralysis in the lower limbs, and many other\r\ndistressing symptoms. I accidentally obtained one of Dr. Pierce's\r\nMedical Advisers from a friend, and finding my ailments so well\r\ndescribed therein, I wrote to Dr. Pierce for his advice, which he sent\r\nby return mail. For my recovery he requested me to use his \"Golden\r\nMedical Discovery,\" his \"Favorite Prescription,\" and his \"Pleasant\r\nPellets.\" He also gave me some directions for every-day living. These\r\nmeans accomplished my complete cure. I am thankful that we can have such\r\nreliable medicines brought into our homes without great expense.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly,\r\n    MRS.

PIERCE: _Dear Sir_--When I commenced your medicines, had\r\nheadache all the time, indigestion, pain in my back and loins, soreness\r\nand stiffness in my joints, my limbs ached so I could not sleep at\r\nnight: I could not lie in bed more than two or three hours any night;\r\nwhen I would lie my head on the pillow I would have to rise immediately\r\nto get breath, sit up and walk the floor very near all night. I could\r\nnot eat anything that would digest; I would do the cooking for the\r\nfamily, but I was in so much pain the tears were in my eyes all the time\r\nI would get a meal ready. I would take one mouthful of bread and then go\r\noff and sit down and cry with hunger, but dare not eat any more, and\r\nthen would have to vomit from that one mouthful of bread--I would have\r\nsuch weak spells I could not stand on my feet.\r\n\r\nI had tried five doctors, they had done me no good; I had given\r\nup--never to take anything more, only to lull the pain. I had given up\r\nto die when I received a pamphlet and some papers from you. I decided to\r\ntry once more and I have been improving ever since I commenced your\r\ntreatment; my health is better than it has been for fifteen years; I\r\nweighed one hundred pounds when I began taking your medicines; now I\r\nweigh one hundred and thirty, as much as I ever weighed. I have taken\r\nten bottles of \"Favorite Prescription\" and still more of \"Golden Medical\r\nDiscovery,\" and several vials of the \"Pellets.\"\r\n\r\n    Your sincere friend, MRS. M.H. O'BANNON,\r\n    Lameta, Leake Co., Miss.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.\r\nNervous System.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NERVOUS SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe nerves of the human body are not unlike the vast telegraph system of\r\nthis continent.\r\n\r\nThe millions of nerve filaments are similar to the network of wires that\r\nkeep all the cities in close sympathy and communion. The nerves have to\r\ndeal with organs instead of villages, and with cells in place of\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\nCommerce is regulated and train loads of food supplies dispatched here\r\nand there by telegraph, while in the body the nerves send their\r\nanalogue, increased blood and nourishment, where it is required.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\nView on roof of Western Union Telegraph Company's Central Station,\r\nBuffalo,\r\nN.Y., showing net-work of wires leading to all parts of the country.]\r\n\r\nThe various organs of sense receive manifold impressions of conditions\r\nto be met, food required and dangers to be avoided and the nerves\r\ntransmit these impressions telegraphically to the brain.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the brain, spinal cord and sympathetic nerves, is not\r\nunlike a gigantic and complicated galvanic battery. The number of cells\r\nin the brain and spine are more numerous, by many millions, than those\r\nsupplying any telegraph system.\r\n\r\nAs the blood supplies each cell with its necessary nourishment and\r\nremoves its used up or waste materials, so does the workman give each\r\ncell of his battery fresh chemicals from time to time, and removes the\r\nused up waste.\r\n\r\nThe wires that lead from this battery to every part of the country are\r\nlike the nerve filaments that go to each part of the human body and make\r\nthem all--no matter how minute--perform their functions in a proper\r\nmanner, and, when done, permit them to retire to rest.\r\n\r\nWith the complicated human structure, when disease takes hold, we have\r\nthe same troubles that would be presented were the telegraph operators\r\nsuddenly to become ill. What confusion and discord would prevail! If the\r\nsickness is severe enough to cause delirium, it would be as though\r\nmadmen were at the telegraph keys dispatching trains of passenger cars\r\nwhich could hardly fail to bring injury and destruction to unwary\r\ntravelers.\r\n\r\nIn health, we are unaware of the work of the nerves. The wheels of life\r\nmove without noise. Few realize that the cavities of the heart (auricles\r\nand ventricles) are contracting steadily and alternately under the\r\nguidance of nerve cells. By this means the stream of blood, laden with\r\nnourishment, is sent to every part of the body.\r\n\r\nSilently the stomach pours out, under nerve influence, its juices that\r\ndissolve and change parts of the food, that it may pass into the blood\r\nin condition to nourish. In a similar way, the pancreas pours out a\r\nfluid that digests the fats.\r\n\r\nThe muscular fibres of the intestines are caused to contract\r\nrhythmically and force along the bolus of digested food, so that its\r\nsoluble parts may be taken up by the minute absorbent vessels to enrich\r\nthe blood.\r\n\r\nAll these things of most vital importance we know least about. They go\r\non, from day to day, without our being aware of the work done.\r\n\r\nLet something interfere with the process, and how quickly is the\r\nsensation changed. Few there are who have not felt the agony of colic\r\npain, due to stoppage of digestion. What suffering is greater than the\r\nsense of awful suffocation from a heart that is not acting well?\r\n\r\nThese are only familiar illustrations of a thousand and one distressing\r\nderangements and symptoms that come from exhaustion and prostration of\r\nthe nervous system.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNERVOUS DEBILITY OR EXHAUSTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis affection, also popularly known as Nervous Prostration, or Nervous\r\nWeakness, and, to the medical profession, as Neurasthenia, or Nervous\r\nAsthenia, is becoming alarmingly prevalent.\r\n\r\nThe wear, tear and strain of modern life are concentrated upon the\r\nnervous system. The care and consequent fret, worry and labor of this\r\nage are greater than ever before known.\r\n\r\nThe result of this extreme activity, is exhaustion and weakness.\r\nPhysical bankruptcy is the result of drawing incessantly upon the\r\nreserve capital of nerve force.\r\n\r\nWe extract the following from an article which recently appeared In the\r\nNew York _Tribune_:\r\n\r\n     AN AGE OF NERVOUSNESS.\r\n\r\n     The stone age, the bronze age and the iron age, we have heard\r\n     of; likewise of the Dark Ages, and other self-marking eras in\r\n     human history. As for the present, it might with fitness be\r\n     known as the age of engineering, or of electricity, both of\r\n     which proud titles it has won by its achievements. Yet there\r\n     is also a less roseate view to be taken of it, and another\r\n     title to be given to it, based upon its too-evident frailties;\r\n     namely, that it is an age of nervousness.\r\n\r\n     Such is the view taken by the famous psychologist, Dr. William\r\n     Erb, of the University of Heidelberg. Nervousness, he says,\r\n     meaning nervous excitement, nervous weakness, is the growing\r\n     malady of the day, the physiological feature of the age.\r\n     Hysteria, hypochondria and neurasthenia are increasing with\r\n     fearful rapidity among both sexes. They begin in childhood, if\r\n     not indeed inherited. Minds are overburdened in school, with\r\n     too much teaching or misdirected teaching. The pleasures of\r\n     social life follow, overexerting the already enfeebled nervous\r\n     system. Business life is made up of hurry and worry and shocks\r\n     and excitements. Society, science, business, art, literature,\r\n     even religion, are all pervaded by a spirit of unrest, and by\r\n     a competitive zeal which urges its victims on remorselessly.\r\n     No man knows repose. The result is, wreckage. The\r\n     pharmacopoeia is overcrowded with nerve tonics, nerve\r\n     stimulants, nerve sedatives. The medical profession devotes\r\n     its best energies to the treatment of neuropaths. And as a\r\n     people we are, or are becoming, excitable, irritable, morbid,\r\n     prone to sudden collapse through snapping of the overtense\r\n     chord of the nervous vitality.\r\n\r\n     Nowhere are the rush and hurry and overstrain of life more\r\n     marked than in this much-achieving Nation. The comparative\r\n     youth and freshness and vigor of the American people enable\r\n     them to do and to endure what would be beyond the power of an\r\n     older and more worn-out community. Yet there is no disguising\r\n     the fact that the pace tells even here, and often tells to\r\n     kill. True, all the tendencies of the age are in that\r\n     direction. Inventions, discoveries, achievements of science,\r\n     all add to the sum of that which is to be learned, and widen\r\n     the field in which there is work to be done. What we need to\r\n     learn is, however, that all these things are for man, not man\r\n     for them. If knowledge has increased, we should take more time\r\n     for acquiring it, knowing that, with the consequent increase\r\n     of power, we shall be able to achieve as much afterward in the\r\n     shorter time as our predecessors did in the longer time their\r\n     briefer study afforded. Greater ability should mean not only\r\n     greater results wrought, but fuller repose as well. For it\r\n     would be a sorry ending of this splendid age of learning and\r\n     of labor to be known as an age of unsettled brains and\r\n     shattered nerves.\r\n\r\nA distinguished medical authority says:\r\n\r\n     \"It is proved beyond any dispute that nervousness is the\r\n     characteristic malady of the American Nation, growing upon\r\n     them in a frightfully accelerated ratio every year, and\r\n     threatening them with disasters at no distant date which the\r\n     mind shrinks from contemplating.\"\r\n\r\n     He continues as follows: \"The number of deaths from this cause\r\n     is already appalling and is steadily and rapidly increasing.\r\n     In some of the busy centres the tables of mortality show that\r\n     the proportion of nerve deaths has multiplied more than twenty\r\n     times in the last forty years, and that now the nerve deaths\r\n     number more than one-fourth of all the deaths recorded. What\r\n     is most shocking in these returns, this fearful loss of life\r\n     occurs mainly among young people of both sexes.\"\r\n\r\n     \"This means that the Americans are fast becoming a very\r\n     short-lived people; and that if they were shut in on\r\n     themselves for only a few years, without any influx of\r\n     vitality by immigration, the publication of the census would\r\n     send a pang of horror and alarm throughout the land.\"\r\n\r\nThe annual report of the State Board of Charities of the State of New\r\nYork for 1894, shows that while the increase in the State's population\r\nfrom 1880 to 1892 was 28 per cent., the increase of the insane in State\r\ninstitutions for the same period was 83 per cent.!\r\n\r\nThe enjoyment of the fruits of fortune, earned at the expense of the\r\nnerve cells, is an impossibility. The quiet and harmony of the nerve\r\ncentres and nervous system are gone. Rest is impossible, continuance of\r\nwork only causes increased jarring and discord of that many stringed and\r\nwonderful mechanism.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS. It is well nigh impossible to give the symptoms of this\r\ndisease in an orderly manner, as the affection gives rise to a thousand\r\nand one varying and ofttimes vague symptoms. The particular part of the\r\nnervous system affected, and also the cause and character of the attacks\r\nmodify the symptoms. The eminent Dr. Wood says: \"Nervous exhaustion may,\r\nin the beginning, affect the whole of the nervous system, or it may be\r\nat first purely local, and co-exist with lack of general nervous\r\nstrength.\"\r\n\r\nSPERMATORRHEA furnishes many examples of the local form of neurasthenia,\r\nor exhaustion, the sexual centres being primarily affected. In these\r\ncases, however, sooner or later, the whole nervous system becomes\r\nInvolved. So in other forms of the disorder, the exhaustion at first\r\nlocal, finally, if neglected, implicates the whole organism. Often, in\r\nbrain exhaustion, the symptoms are at first purely local. Almost always\r\nthe cause of a local neurasthenia, or exhaustion, is excessive use of\r\nthe part. Thus, cerebral or brain exhaustion, or debility, is usually\r\nthe result of mental overwork, while sexual asthenia, or weakness is\r\ngenerally due to abuse of the sexual organs or to sexual excesses. When\r\nto the brain fatigue, or exhaustion, are added the depressing effects of\r\nexcessive anxiety, or allied emotions, the symptoms from the first are\r\nmore general, and the exhaustion may effect chiefly a single function of\r\nthe brain. In pure brain exhaustion, the loss of a disposition to work,\r\nis usually the first symptom, the sufferer finding that it constantly\r\nrequires a more and more painful effort of the will to perform the\r\nallotted task. At first, there is loss of the power of fixing the\r\nattention, and this, by and by, is accompanied by a weakness of the\r\nmemory; disturbances of sleep are frequent; various abnormal sensations\r\nin the head are complained of. In most cases there is not absolute\r\nheadache, but a feeling of weight or fullness, or an indescribable\r\ndistress, usually aggravated by mental effort. It is true that in some\r\ncases of very dangerous brain tire, mental labor is performed with\r\nextraordinary vigor and ease; the power of work, is, for the time,\r\nmarkedly increased, and even the quality of the product may be raised.\r\nThe patient may glory in a wild intellectual exaltation, a sense of\r\nmental power, with an almost uncontrollable brain activity. It is\r\nprobable, however, that these cases are not instances of pure\r\nneurasthenia, or brain exhaustion, but that there is active congestion\r\nof the gray matter of the brain. In these cases the disease is very\r\nprone to end in serious organic affection of the brain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Melancholy. ]\r\n\r\nSevere brain exhaustion may be associated with good spirits, but usually\r\nthere is marked depression, and this perversion of function generally\r\ngoes on, if the disease be not checked, to decided melancholy. The will\r\npower, like all the other functional activities of the brain, is prone\r\nto be weakened, morbid fears may finally develop, and at last, that\r\nwhich was at the beginning a single brain exhaustion, may end in\r\npersistent hypochondria, followed by insanity.\r\n\r\nPeculiar sensations are common in neurasthenia, such as chilliness,\r\nunnatural itching, a feeling as though ants or other insects were\r\ncrawling on the skin. Eruptions are common. Attacks of neuralgia are\r\noften frequent and sometimes severe, being usually worse in those\r\npersons of nervous ancestry. In some cases there is a lack of proper\r\nsensation, in others an unnatural sensitiveness. There is also in many\r\ncases a peculiar tenderness over some portion of the spinal column,\r\nespecially in women.\r\n\r\nIN WOMEN, with nervous disturbance of the sexual organs, there is\r\nfrequently great pain felt during menstruation; in others, ovarian\r\nirritation and a so-called \"irritable,\" or sensitive uterus, giving rise\r\nto manifold nervous and hysterical symptoms, sometimes culminating in\r\nconvulsions or \"fits.\" In not a small proportion of the uterine diseases\r\nwhich are generally only locally treated by physicians, the local\r\ndisease is largely and sometimes solely the expression of a general\r\nweakness of nervous origin.\r\n\r\n\r\nSELF-ABUSE AND EXCESSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is well known that Onanism, or masturbation, as well as sexual\r\nexcesses, produce an exhaustion of the nerve centres presiding over the\r\nsexual functions. This is the common history of spermatorrhea or loss of\r\nthe virile fluid by nightly emissions, accompanied by lascivious dreams.\r\n\r\nGENERAL NEURASTHENIA, or nervous exhaustion, may also produce a local\r\nweakness of the sexual centres of the brain and spinal cord, with\r\nsymptoms at least resembling those of partial impotency and great\r\nirritability of the sexual organs, or a complete impotence, with\r\npremature seminal discharge whenever coition is attempted. Many times\r\nthis condition results from excessive intellectual labor, even with no\r\nsexual excesses or abuses. Nocturnal, or nightly emissions, are not\r\nalways experienced in these cases. When they do occur, the debilitating\r\nlosses of vital fluid react upon the brain, robbing the victim of\r\ncourage and manliness and exciting various phases of morbid fear and\r\nsensitiveness.\r\n\r\nMany cases of nervous debility, or exhaustion, are the result of long\r\ncontinued malarial poisoning, diarrhea, Bright's disease, exhausting\r\nfevers or other debilitating affections. Numerous are the cases in which\r\nthe patient is able to trace the origin of the malady back to an attack\r\nof influenza, or grip. An epidemic of the latter disease is sure to be\r\nfollowed by numerous cases of nervous prostration, or exhaustion.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARE SHOULD BE EXERCISED.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, it is necessary to make careful examinations in order to\r\ndetect any obscure chronic disease which may exist. In women, nervous\r\nprostration often develops without perceptible cause at the age of\r\npuberty or at the \"change of life.\" Overwork, especially overwork\r\ncombined with worry, are fruitful causes of nervous exhaustion in both\r\nsexes.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN OVERWORKED NERVOUS SYSTEM\r\n\r\nis always an exhausted nervous system. The nerve cells have been robbed\r\nof their vital forces. All the nutritive organs of the body suffer from\r\nthe lack of nerve control, and the blood-vessels that supply the nerve\r\ncentres are not in proper tone. Hence the supply of blood and the action\r\nof the heart are greatly interfered with. Many times, the most\r\ntroublesome symptom, early in the disease, is an excessive perspiration\r\nof the hands and feet.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPOVERISHED OR POOR BLOOD.\r\n\r\nA badly nourished nervous system is irritable. Many of the symptoms of\r\nweakness and lack of nutrition resemble those found in congestion, or\r\nstimulation from excess of blood. Then, too, we find sometimes that\r\npoor, thin, watery blood, not suitable for nourishment although sent in\r\nlarge amount to the brain, does not properly nourish that organ. There\r\nwill still be brain exhaustion, as the nervous structures have lost\r\ntheir power of absorbing the nutrient materials from the blood which,\r\nbeing poor in quality, does not vitalize and strengthen the nerve\r\ncentres as it should. In such cases thought is an effort and sustained\r\nmental exertion is impossible; the memory is uncertain, and the patient\r\ndrowsy. Occasionally, after rest, there may be flashes of brilliancy,\r\nbut generally they are brief.\r\n\r\n\r\nDANGER OF CONTRACTING INTEMPERANCE.\r\n\r\nThe patient often learns that a small amount of wine or spirits is a\r\ntemporary aid, and sometimes its habitual use is begun in this way.\r\nStimulants only make a bad matter worse when their use is continued for\r\nany considerable length of time. The sufferer becomes more and more\r\ndependent upon them and the nervous exhaustion is much aggravated as\r\nlarge quantities are taken to satisfy the morbid craving that has been\r\nacquired.\r\n\r\nWAKEFULNESS, OR INSOMNIA, is present in many cases; in others, there is\r\nunusual drowsiness but sleep gives neither rest nor strength; often it\r\nis disturbed by dreams that exhaust the vitality and leave the patient\r\nmore tired than when rest was sought.\r\n\r\nHEADACHE is one of the most annoying symptoms and sometimes is very\r\npersistent. It may incapacitate the patient for the ordinary duties of\r\nlife. After laying down awhile and being quiet, the headache may be\r\nrelieved, but recurs on attempting to go about.\r\n\r\nFRETFULNESS. Sometimes, owing to the discomfort experienced, there is\r\nlikely to be a change of disposition, irritability of temper,\r\nfretfulness and peevishness; a tendency to an irascibility all out of\r\nproportion to the real provocation. In many cases there is dizziness,\r\nand frequently noises in the head, ringing in the ears, spots before the\r\neyes, twitching of the muscles, eyelids or eye muscles, and at times\r\ndimness of vision, or sudden spells when the sight is not satisfactory.\r\nAt times there is a feeling of discomfort, as if the quantity of good\r\nair were not sufficient to aerate the blood, and there is sighing or a\r\ndesire to sit in an open window, or a strong desire to be fanned. The\r\npulse and temperature are usually normal, or a little below, but may\r\nrise if any local irritation exists. At times the face is flushed and at\r\nothers pale. The skin may be dry, or in other cases bathed in\r\nperspiration on slight exertion or mental worry. When there is weakness\r\nof the nervous system, the disease manifests itself through various\r\norgans. Hence, the palpitation of the heart, dyspepsia or acute attacks\r\nof indigestion, with colicky pains and heaviness after meals, with\r\neructations or belchings of gas, or local discomfort and unnatural\r\naction affecting, at different times, almost every organ of the body. It\r\nis well known that insanity may result from the loss of sleep and\r\nconstant brooding over the symptoms that the patient fails to properly\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.\r\n\r\nIn no class of diseases is greater care, scientific knowledge and skill\r\nmore necessary than in the treatment of nervous affections. Almost every\r\ncase is a law unto itself, and must receive careful consideration,\r\npains-taking advice and specially prescribed treatment suited to the\r\npeculiarities of the individual. Hereditary influences, causes of the\r\ndisease and constitutional peculiarities of the patient must all be\r\ntaken into account.\r\n\r\n\r\nVALUE OF EXPERIENCE.\r\n\r\nOnly through extensive experience can the medical practitioner become\r\nexpert at detecting and successfully meeting, by rational scientific and\r\ncarefully adapted treatment, the many phases and complications incident\r\nto the different forms and stages of this very prevalent malady.\r\n\r\nFor more than a quarter of a century, the Specialists of the Invalids\r\nHotel and Surgical Institute having charge of this department of\r\npractice, have been actively engaged battling with diseases of the\r\nnervous system. As a result of this long time and vast experience, they\r\nhave naturally developed and thoroughly tested many valuable remedial\r\nagencies for the relief and cure of this class of sufferers. Many of\r\nthese can be successfully prescribed and used at the patients' homes\r\nwithout a personal consultation; while others can only be brought into\r\nuse at our Institution.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT AT HOME.\r\n\r\nMany cases, especially when the exciting cause of the malady can be\r\neasily ascertained, as in spermatorrhea from self-abuse, or sexual\r\nexcesses, or in women when arising from uterine affections, can be very\r\nsuccessfully managed and cured at home. This is also true when the\r\ndisease is due to the excessive use of tobacco, opium and other\r\nnarcotics.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSULTATION BY LETTER.\r\n\r\nThe patient has thought over his symptoms hundreds of times. The\r\nlocation of every discomfort has been carefully noted. These matters are\r\nstated with accuracy, common sense and good judgment when writing to us.\r\nThe people are far more intelligent in these matters than physicians are\r\ngenerally willing to admit. A patient is often confused while being\r\npersonally examined by a physician and gives imperfect or incorrect\r\nanswers. After he has left the presence of the physician, he finds that\r\nhe has failed to enumerate many of the most important symptoms. In\r\nconsulting by letter, the patient is not embarrassed, states the exact\r\nsymptoms and carefully reads over the letter, to see if it is a complete\r\nand accurate description of his sufferings. In this way he often conveys\r\na much better idea of the case than if present in person, and subject to\r\nthe most thorough questioning and \"cross-examination.\" The timid lady\r\nand nervous young man write just as they feel and one reason why we have\r\nhad such success in treating intricate and delicate diseases, is because\r\nwe have obtained such true and natural statements of the cases from\r\nthese letters, many of which are perfect pen pictures of disease. As\r\nbank tellers and cashiers, who daily handle large quantities of\r\ncurrency, can unmistakably detect spurious money by a glance at the\r\nengraving or touch of the paper, so the experienced physician, by his\r\ngreat familiarity with disease, becomes equally skilled in detecting the\r\nnature and extent of a chronic malady, from a written description of its\r\nsymptoms. To aid the patient in giving a clear and intelligible history\r\nof his case we send, when requested, a very complete question blank.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMINATION OF THE URINE.\r\n\r\nA careful, microscopical examination and chemical analysis of the urine\r\nis a valuable aid in determining the nature of these diseases of the\r\nnervous system. This important fact is not overlooked at the Invalids'\r\nHotel and Surgical Institute, where experienced chemists are employed to\r\nmake such examinations and report the result to the attending\r\nphysicians. Persons consulting us and desiring to avail themselves of\r\nthe advantages afforded by these examinations, can send a sample of\r\ntheir urine by express. The bottle should be thoroughly cleansed and\r\nshould contain from two to four ounces of that first passed after\r\narising in the morning. It should be carefully packed in saw-dust or\r\npaper and inclosed in a light wooden box. All express charges must be\r\nprepaid through and a complete history of the case, including the age\r\nand sex of the patient, should accompany every package, or it will\r\nreceive no attention. This saves valuable time by directing the\r\nexamination into the channels indicated and thus avoiding a lengthy\r\nseries of experiments. As we are daily receiving numerous bottles of\r\nurine, every sample, to prevent confusion, should be labeled with the\r\npatient's name. By the postal regulations, all liquids are excluded from\r\nthe mails, unless packed in accordance with our printed directions,\r\nwhich will be sent free on request being received for them.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE AIM TO CURE,\r\n\r\nnot merely to palliate as is so often done by practitioners in dealing\r\nwith these distressing maladies. We do not prescribe coca mixtures,\r\nwhiskey, malt extracts, so-called celery compounds or other nerve\r\nstimulants, which only spur the already weakened nervous system on as a\r\nman would urge his jaded horse to renewed efforts when the animal should\r\nbe refreshed by proper food and rest. Neither have we any faith, in\r\nlasting good resulting from prescribing such nerve sedatives as put the\r\nnerves to sleep and so, by simply blunting sensibility, delude the\r\npatient into the false belief that he is being benefited.\r\n\r\nTo effect a radical cure of the weakness, the nerve centres must be\r\nrestored to a normal condition by improving the nutrition of the nerve\r\ncells. To do this the causes of the difficulty must be understood and\r\nany local weakness or disease of any organ, be it the liver, kidneys,\r\nlungs, stomach, rectum, bladder, or generative organs, must be\r\nunderstood, properly treated and overcome. The desire for alcoholic\r\nstimulants is a most common and dangerous tendency of the disease. To\r\ngratify the morbid appetite for stimulants is to do the patient lasting\r\ninjury.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPOVERISHED BLOOD.\r\n\r\nIn some cases the nervous affection is the result of an impure, or\r\nimpoverished, condition of the blood. In such cases the use of Dr.\r\nPierce's Golden Medical Discovery has, in the great majority of cases,\r\nresulted in an immediate benefit and gradually in a permanent\r\nrestoration of the nerve centres to a normal condition. This remedy,\r\nparticularly if assisted by the use of Dr. Pierce's Pleasant Pellets,\r\nwhen constipation is present, unloads the liver, and their combined\r\naction tends to remove from the blood the poisons which it is the\r\nfunction of the liver to take from that fluid. The cells of the brain,\r\nafter performing their function, throw into the blood certain poisonous\r\nmaterials which it is the function of the liver to remove. If this is\r\nnot done, the cells become clogged, and can only be restored to a\r\nnatural and healthful condition by increasing the activity of the liver.\r\nThis treatment gives rise to an immediate improvement, and a continuance\r\nof the remedies results in a gradual toning up of the nervous system and\r\nrelief from the unpleasant symptoms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"FEMALE WEAKNESS.\"\r\n\r\nMany women suffer from nervous prostration, or exhaustion, owing to\r\ncongestion of the uterus and ovaries, caused by over-indulgence; again\r\nby overwork, the strain of too many household cares, or too frequent\r\nchildbirths. In these cases, the use of Dr. Pierce's Favorite\r\nPrescription is of the greatest benefit, tending to restore the uterus\r\nand ovaries to a normal condition. Its wonderful restorative effects,\r\ntonic and nerve invigorating properties, especially adapt it to the cure\r\nof these cases. Digestion and assimilation of food are promoted by its\r\nuse. When the liver or blood is not in healthful condition, as\r\npreviously referred to, the \"Golden Medical Discovery\" should be used in\r\nconjunction with the \"Prescription.\" If menstruation be scanty, Dr.\r\nPierce's Pellets will have a beneficial influence in increasing the\r\nflow, and overcoming the headache and congestion of internal organs that\r\nis the result of scanty menstruation, especially if their use be\r\naccompanied with full doses of Dr. Pierce's Compound Extract of\r\nSmart-Weed.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCAL CAUSES.\r\n\r\nIn the great majority of cases, when nervous prostration has made its\r\nappearance at intervals, with periods of prolonged good health\r\nintervening, but in which, as a rule, slight excesses, over-exertion or\r\nthe attacks of some acute disease, produces a nervous exhaustion, we\r\nhave found that local derangement is the cause of the whole trouble.\r\nThis cause may often be readily removed and a perfect and permanent\r\nrestoration of the health will follow.\r\n\r\nIN MEN, we have often found a varicocele to be the cause of nervous\r\nprostration. In others rupture, or urethral stricture, sometimes of a\r\ncharacter so mild as hardly to give serious inconvenience, has been the\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nIN WOMEN,, ulceration of the uterus, stricture of the cervix, congestion\r\nor other diseases of the ovaries, such as cysts, abscesses, etc.,\r\ninflammation of the Fallopian tubes, characterized with more or less\r\nperiodical discomfort and attacks of leucorrhea, or \"whites,\" are common\r\ncauses.\r\n\r\nIn all cases in which the nervous disease depends upon local causes, we\r\nfind that the relief of the local source of irritation, which tends to\r\nreduce the general health and interfere with perfect nervous tone, is\r\nall that is necessary to give the invalid a perfect restoration to\r\nhealth, vigor and activity. It is like removing the burden from a tired\r\nhorse who has fallen prostrate under an excessive load. The removal of\r\nthe burden puts the individual under a favorable condition for the\r\nimmediate restoration to health and strength, and permanent relief is\r\nonly a matter of a few days' or weeks' time, with appropriate\r\nnourishment and restorative nerve tonics.\r\n\r\n\r\nALCOHOL, OPIUM AND TOBACCO\r\n\r\naffect different individuals according to their several\r\nsusceptibilities. Some are able to withstand, with apparent impunity, an\r\namount of these that can not be tolerated by others without great\r\ninjury. No one, however, is wholly proof against these unwholesome\r\nagents which are in such common use. The sad results of their excessive\r\nuse are seen in thousands of cases of shattered nerves and wasted vigor.\r\nThe excessive use of tea and coffee is also a prolific cause of nervous\r\naffections.\r\n\r\nHappily, we have now at our command remedies which exercise a most\r\npotent controlling influence over the acquired, morbid appetite for\r\nthese narcotics and stimulants. Of course we have to depend, to some\r\nextent, upon the will power of the patient, but where this is not wholly\r\nlost, we have in all our later experience, been able to realize a degree\r\nof success which has been alike gratifying to both physician and\r\npatient.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INVALIDS' HOTEL AND SURGICAL INSTITUTE SPECIALLY EQUIPPED FOR THE\r\nCURE OF NERVOUS AFFECTIONS.\r\n\r\nPrivate institutions, well supplied with the numerous and costly aids to\r\nthe work of the specialist treating nervous diseases, are now a\r\nrecognized necessity. Physicians and sufferers alike appreciate this\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nPublic hospitals do not answer this purpose, owing to the fact that they\r\nare more especially intended for the alleviation of the sufferings of\r\nthe poor, and the greater part of the work done is in affording relief\r\nfrom acute diseases and emergencies requiring surgical aid. Attention is\r\nthus detracted from delicate nervous affections and is almost wholly\r\nengrossed in caring for sufferers from other diseases and injuries.\r\nBesides, association with the charity cases that abound in such places\r\nand the evidences of suffering present on every hand, are enough to\r\nprevent all improvement in sensitive and sympathetic invalids.\r\n\r\nPerfect equipment is an important part of the battle in the cure of\r\nnervous affections.\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTRICITY IN NERVOUS AFFECTIONS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.\r\nOur large 40 cell Galvano-Faradic Battery with Switch-board.]\r\n\r\nElectrical applications, to be beneficial, require, on the part of the\r\nattendant, a technical knowledge of the highest character with costly\r\napparatus and special appliances. There can be little doubt that\r\nelectricity is convertible into nerve force.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.\r\nOur Franklin, or Static Electricity, Machine.]\r\n\r\nIn treating cases in the Invalids' Hotel, a large variety of batteries,\r\ndynamos and other electrical appliances are brought into use. These\r\nconsist of cell batteries, such as is illustrated by Fig. 4, dynamos,\r\noperated by power, Franklin, or static electrical machines illustrated\r\nin Fig. 5, and other electrical apparatus, the choice of the particular\r\nmachine or battery being determined by the nature of the case.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARE AND SKILL REQUIRED.\r\n\r\nElectricity, like other powerful agencies, in order to prove remedial\r\nmust be used of proper strength and in proper quantity. The potential,\r\nor strength, as well as the volume, or amount, of current has to be\r\ncarefully measured for that purpose. To accomplish this, we employ an\r\ninstrument called a galvanometer, or amperemeter, illustrated in Fig. 6,\r\nwhich indicates the exact amount of current being applied. For the want\r\nof such instruments to measure the current, physicians often fail to get\r\nbeneficial results, as they are not able to administer either the proper\r\nquantity or quality of current. Ofttimes, for like reasons, their\r\nhap-hazard way of employing this powerful agent does positive injury to\r\nthe patient.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.\r\nThe Galvanometer, or Amperemeter.]\r\n\r\nOf course, in treating cases at a distance, we cannot avail ourselves of\r\nall the great variety of apparatus brought into use at our Invalids\r\nHotel, yet we have some forms of machines well adapted for home use, and\r\nso simple that, by sending plain printed directions with the machines,\r\nour patients are able to use them effectively without the aid of the\r\nphysician. Especially is this true in the milder forms of nervous\r\ndisease, and when great exactness and nicety of application is not so\r\nimportant. We show in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8, two forms of such batteries\r\nwhich are often furnished our patients for use at their homes. Many\r\ntimes, after cases are under treatment here for a while, we are able to\r\neducate them in the use of the battery so that by taking one of these\r\nhome with them they can continue the treatment with good results after\r\nleaving the Institution.\r\n\r\n\r\nORGANIC, OR ANIMAL, EXTRACTS AS REMEDIES.\r\n\r\nThe experience of Pasteur, Brown-Sequard, and our own specialists, in\r\nthe use of extracts of nerve substance and of certain glands and organs\r\nby hypodermic or subcutaneous injection of these fluids, has, in a vast\r\nnumber of cases, been most gratifying to both physicians and patients.\r\nMany wonderful cures have thus been obtained. Injected subcutaneously\r\nthese animal extracts are immediately assimilated and we are often able\r\nto stop, at once, the progress of disease and turn the tide towards\r\nrecovery. Thus the cells receive the special stimulants upon which their\r\nlife and activity depend.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.\r\nA small Battery for home use.]\r\n\r\nThe animal extracts employed in our Institution are all scientifically\r\nand carefully produced in our chemical laboratory under the direct\r\nsupervision of an experienced chemist, and are believed to be superior\r\nin quality. They are turned out fresh, as wanted, which is important, as\r\nall such preparations, no matter how carefully made and put up,\r\ndeteriorate with age.\r\n\r\nThese extracts are made from the glands and organs of the lower animals,\r\nas from the brain, spinal cord, heart, testicles, ovaries and some other\r\norgans and parts of bullocks, rabbits, guinea pigs and other animals.\r\nThat they possess properties which exert most potent tonic, or\r\ninvigorating, influences upon those organs and parts of the human system\r\ncorresponding to the organs and parts of the lower animals from which\r\nthey have been extracted, no longer admits of doubt. In cases of partial\r\nand even complete impotency, especially in elderly men, attended with\r\nnervous exhaustion, most astonishingly favorable results are obtained by\r\nour specialists through the administration of our extracts obtained from\r\nthe nerve tissue of the spinal cord, associated with the use of the\r\nexpressed juices from animal testes. We do not, however, prescribe these\r\nextracts to the exclusion of other well tested remedial agents, but do\r\nregard them, especially in the more confirmed and obstinate cases, as\r\namong our most positive curative agents.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.\r\nA small Battery for home use.]\r\n\r\nWe must confess that when first proclaimed by Brown-Sequard as Valuable\r\nremedial agents, we regarded the use of these extracts with good deal of\r\nskepticism, but experience is, after all, the best teacher and we were\r\nforced, after numerous successful tests, to admit their great efficacy.\r\nWe have always endeavored to keep up with the vanguard of the army of\r\nmedical reform, and so took early occasion to introduce these agents\r\ninto our practice and made preparations to produce them in our\r\nlaboratory.\r\n\r\nFrom an article written by an eminent specialist in nervous diseases,\r\nand recently published in the New York _Medical Journal_, we extract the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n    \"Organic beings possess the power of assimilating from the\r\n    nutritious matters they absorb the peculiar pabulum which\r\n    each organ of the body demands for the development and\r\n    sustenance. The brain, for instance, selects that part which\r\n    it requires, the heart the material necessary for its growth\r\n    and preservation, and so on with the liver, the lungs, the\r\n    muscles, and the various other organs of the body. No mistake\r\n    is ever committed. The brain never takes liver nutriment, nor\r\n    the liver brain nutriment; but each selects that which it\r\n    requires. There are, however, diseased conditions of the\r\n    various organs in which this power is lost or impaired, and,\r\n    as a consequence, disturbance of function, or even death\r\n    itself, is the result.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Now, if we can obtain the peculiar matter that an organ of\r\n    the body requires and inject it directly into the blood, we\r\n    do away with the performance of many vital processes which\r\n    are accomplished only by the expenditure of a large amount of\r\n    vital force.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Let us suppose a person suffering from an exhausted brain,\r\n    the result of excessive brain-work. Three hearty meals are\r\n    eaten every day, but, no matter how judiciously the food may\r\n    be arranged, the condition continues. Now, if we inject into\r\n    that person's blood a concentrated extract of the brain of a\r\n    healthy animal, we supply at once the pabulum which the organ\r\n    requires. Then, if under this treatment the morbid symptoms\r\n    disappear, we are justified in concluding that we have\r\n    successfully aided Nature in doing that which, unassisted,\r\n    she could not accomplish.\"\r\n\r\n    \"That is the system. I believe it is applicable not only to\r\n    the brain, but to all the other organs of the body.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe writer of the above is, very probably, a little over sanguine in his\r\nopinion that the plan of treatment will prove efficacious in all organic\r\ndiseases, but certainly, from our experience, we can endorse his belief\r\nas to its great efficacy in many forms of organic weakness, especially\r\nthose of the generative organs, nervous system, heart and some other\r\nparts of the body. We believe that we are placing a conservative\r\nestimate upon the remedial value of these animal juices, or extracts,\r\nwhen we say that they are destined to fill an important place in the\r\ncurative resources of the specialist in chronic diseases.\r\n\r\nUnder the head of epilepsy, also in connection with our consideration of\r\nlocomotor ataxia, we shall have occasion to refer to the use of these\r\nextracts as applicable to the cure of those maladies.\r\n\r\nMost cases of nervous diseases that come to us, for examination and\r\ntreatment, do so after having tried, without success, treatment by\r\nbaths, enforced seclusion, as well as unskillfully applied electrical\r\ntreatment and massage. Prolonged medication has frequently aroused\r\ndigestive disorders and made the patient hate the sight of the medicine\r\nbottle. In such cases our improved methods, as applied in the\r\nInstitution and also prescribed for patients at a distance, enable our\r\nspecialists to give relief and effect cures with a minimum of medicine.\r\nThey also enable us to treat many cases of nervous diseases heretofore\r\nregarded as almost hopeless, such as locomotor ataxia, paralysis,\r\nepilepsy and spinal affections, with a degree of success which has been\r\nvery gratifying alike to physicians and patients.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADACHE AND NEURALGIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no ill to which flesh is heir that is the source of a greater\r\ndegree of discomfort to the human race than headache. The farmer,\r\nhousewife, banker, merchant and laborer seem to be equally prone to the\r\naffliction and all who suffer have a great number of days rendered\r\nuncomfortable and unhappy by the presence of this most unpleasant\r\naffection. Pain is the warning finger of disease--the threatening\r\nindication of coming trouble. In headache, we have an indication that\r\nthe system is subjected to some strain or injurious impression. It may\r\nbe that the eyes have been overworked or the brain unnaturally taxed; or\r\nthat the nervous and physical systems have not been properly refreshed\r\nby sufficient sleep, and have used up the residue of reserve power. Many\r\nsuffer from headache only after they have been subjected to sudden\r\nchanges of temperature and have taken cold; others only when the bowels\r\nhave become inactive, the liver torpid and the blood vitiated with\r\nretained poisons.\r\n\r\nAll appreciate the discomfort that results from this malady and\r\nearnestly seek for permanent relief.\r\n\r\nHeadaches may be divided in two classes: (1) those due to the presence\r\nof poisons in the blood, and (2) those due to irritation of various\r\norgans, as of the eyes, stomach, liver, and intestines.\r\n\r\nOf the first form, or variety, of headache, influenza, or grip, and\r\nacute \"cold in the head,\" are the most common causes. These give rise to\r\nmost excruciating pain. There is congestion, followed by inflammation in\r\nthe nasal passages and cavities communicating therewith. The membranes\r\nof these passages throw out a thin, watery, irritating discharge, which\r\ngradually thickens and becomes pus-like and offensive in character, if\r\nthe disease continues.\r\n\r\nPoisonous matters are absorbed from the affected surfaces into the\r\nblood. These poisons, circulating in the blood, produce great irritation\r\nof the nerve cells, so much so, that the severity of the attack is felt\r\nin the nervous centres, the brain and spinal cord, with pain varying\r\nfrom the most acute and sharp, to a dull, numb ache. The temples, eyes,\r\nneck and small of the back, are in their order, the usual locations of\r\ngreatest pain. Such attacks vary in frequency and severity. One attack\r\nis usually followed by an early recurrence, which may be more or less\r\nsevere, while the period of active pain varies from a few hours to\r\nseveral days. Such attacks leave an exhausted state of the nerve centres\r\nand general weakness of the system that often lasts for weeks and may\r\npermanently impair the system, except such results be prevented by\r\nappropriate treatment. Every recurrence of the attack leaves the system\r\nin a worse condition, until profound nervous prostration; ensues.\r\n\r\nMalarial headache, sometimes termed \"brow ague,\" is a common form of the\r\nmalady with those residing in malarial regions. The pain rapidly\r\ndevelops, usually over one eye. It lasts from five to ten hours, and is\r\noften of frightful intensity.\r\n\r\nOther forms are rheumatic and gouty headache; usually a heavy aching\r\npain appearing on the approach of storms, but at times almost\r\ncontinuous, made worse by improper diet.\r\n\r\nUræmic headache is due to kidney disease, and alcoholic to direct\r\nirritation of the brain membranes from the use of alcoholic beverages.\r\nThe latter is accompanied with much irritation of the stomach and\r\nintestines.\r\n\r\nHeadaches of a similar character result from the presence in the blood\r\nof an excess of the active principles of coffee and tea.\r\n\r\nOverindulgence in these agents, as with alcohol, affects the nerve cells\r\nand membranes, often causing severe attacks of headache.\r\n\r\nNervous headache is another common affliction. This seems to arise from\r\nseveral causes, such as impoverished blood and exhaustion from overwork\r\nof the brain. Hysterical headache is not uncommon. There is a severe\r\nkind of headache, the attacks of which appear first at early puberty and\r\ncontinue at intervals more or less frequent in women up to the change of\r\nlife and in men to about the fortieth year.\r\n\r\nThe periodical headache is usually preceded by yawning, chilliness,\r\nlanguid, exhausted feelings, in others by peculiar emotional or mental\r\nactivity. This is followed by unusual drowsiness, in which the night's\r\nrest is broken by dreams, and from which the patient awakes tired.\r\nGradually, during the day, the headache develops, beginning in the eyes\r\nor bones over them. It gets more and more severe, shooting into the jaws\r\nand neck or extending to the back of the head and spine. As the pains\r\nget most severe, nausea or vomiting, often repeated, follow, in which\r\nthe contents of the stomach, with mucus and bile, is ejected. The whole\r\nparoxysm lasts from five hours to two or even three days.\r\n\r\nNEURALGIC HEADACHE is a common variety; often the pain is not confined\r\nto the head, in fact neuralgia may affect almost any part of the system.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEURALGIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nNeuralgia is an affection of the nerves, of which the chief symptom is\r\npain. This is of variable intensity and character. It follows the course\r\nof the affected nerve and its branches, and occurs in paroxysms, of\r\nagonizing pain with periods of intermission during which the pain may be\r\nvery slight, and cause but little discomfort.\r\n\r\nThe severe pain is described as lancinating, cutting, tearing, burning,\r\nboring and pressing. Patients use different words in describing the\r\nattacks, and there is probably a difference in the character of the\r\npain, though in a severe paroxysm one is scarcely able to make a very\r\nnice distinction. We have known cases in which the pain occurred\r\nsuddenly and overwhelmed the patient's fortitude by its severity and\r\nunexpected onset. Between the paroxysms there may be less severe pain,\r\nwhich is then more frequently of an aching, burning or pricking\r\ncharacter. In some, paroxysm after paroxysm succeed each other with\r\nalmost lightening-like rapidity, and even in the intervals the pain is\r\nvery intense. At another time there is only one sharp sting of pain,\r\nwhich attacks recur several times an hour or day, or may be absent for\r\ndays or months. An extended freedom from all pain is rare in a patient\r\nvery much affected. The first attacks in all forms of neuralgia are\r\noften comparatively light, and the severity of the pain gradually\r\nincreases as the attacks multiply. We have frequently had patients\r\nunacquainted with anatomy, map out the distribution of a nerve very\r\nperfectly, simply describing the portion of the body in which the pain\r\nwas experienced. For convenience, the neuralgia has been named with\r\nreference to the nerve most seriously attacked; lumbago to the spasms of\r\npain affecting the small of the back; tic-douloureux is a term applied\r\nto neuralgia of the fifth nerve, that supplying the side of the face,\r\nwith branches to the eyes, jaw, and teeth. Neuralgia of the testicles,\r\novaries, stomach, heart, are frequently met with. That affecting the\r\nlarge nerve supplying the thigh and leg is termed sciatica. These nerve\r\naffections often prove a most grave disorder, rendering the life of the\r\nsufferer a burden.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. Contrary to opinions frequently expressed by members of the\r\nmedical profession, we find that most cases present some removable, or\r\nremediable, cause for attacks of headache and neuralgia. The temporary\r\nrelief that is obtained by the use of \"headache powders,\" various\r\nbromide combinations, caffeine and other anodyne and narcotic medicines,\r\nis sometimes necessary in order that the excruciating sufferings may be\r\nborne for the time, but as a rule such remedies only react unfavorably\r\nby interfering still further with the natural restoration of the\r\naffected organs, or protract the removal of the cause of the disease.\r\nHence, the next attack is usually earlier in its appearance and more\r\nsevere and lasting when such agents are employed.\r\n\r\nThe great majority of headaches and neuralgias are due to the presence\r\nof poisons in the blood. This may be due to affections of the\r\nblood-making, or blood-purifying organs.\r\n\r\nFor the correction of inactive blood-making glands, or a lack of\r\npurification of the blood, due to such cause, the use of Dr. Pierce's\r\nGolden Medical Discovery is particularly beneficial. It has no equal in\r\nits direct effect upon the liver, the great purifying organ of the body.\r\nThrough this natural gateway, it removes from the system poisonous\r\nmaterials which are the waste from the nerve cells. The accumulation of\r\nthese waste materials irritates the cells and causes them to cry out\r\nwith pain. The blood, being properly purified by the use of \"Golden\r\nMedical Discovery\" supplies to the nerves, and to the nerve cells, what\r\nthey crave--a healthy and rich blood that furnishes proper nourishment.\r\nHence the headache disappears, and the neuralgic pains are overcome.\r\n\r\nWhen the liver is engorged and torpid, the intestines become overloaded\r\nwith fecal matters that putrefy and give rise to gases and consequent\r\ndistention. Deleterious poisons are formed and absorbed by the blood\r\nfrom such hardened and irritating lumps in the intestines. When the\r\nbowels are thus constipated, Dr. Pierce's Pleasant Pellets are necessary\r\nas an adjunct to the \"Golden Medical Discovery.\" The \"Pellets\" remove\r\nfrom the intestinal canal all irritating materials and thus enhance the\r\nalterative, or blood-cleansing, action of the \"Golden Medical\r\nDiscovery.\"\r\n\r\nIn women, when there is a nervous affection, dependent upon some\r\nunnatural state of the ovaries or uterus, and complicated with an\r\nimperfect or unnatural circulation in those parts, we have noted that\r\nmost satisfactory results invariably follow the use of Dr. Pierce's\r\nFavorite Prescription. This agent improves the tone of the nervous\r\nsystem, and by its direct restorative tonic effects, lessens, or\r\novercomes, any congestion of the womb or its appendages, regulates\r\nmenstruation and promotes a condition of health and vigor.\r\n\r\nIn a vast experience, our specialists have thoroughly tested a great\r\nmany specific remedies which we prescribe for home-treatment, sending\r\nthe necessary remedies to our patients by express or mail, carefully\r\nadapting them to each individual case. Many sufferers have been, by a\r\nbrief course of our home-treatment, relieved permanently from\r\nexcruciating sufferings that had been a source of annoyance and loss of\r\ntime for many years prior to the use of our remedies.\r\n\r\nOur treatment is intended to effect permanent cures. We do not use those\r\nnarcotics and compounds of antipyrine and other similar agents which are\r\nvery depressing in their effects, and, like morphine and other\r\npreparations of opium, give only temporary relief, and interfere with\r\nthe action of the heart, but we use treatment that builds up the system,\r\nremoves the cause of the difficulty and restores the nervous system and\r\nall the organs of the body to a normal and healthful condition.\r\n\r\nIn some cases we advise treatment in our Institution, where we have\r\nevery facility in the way of electrical appliances and many other aids\r\nthat can only be employed by the personal attention of a skillful\r\nphysician. These aids are more fully described under the head of nervous\r\nexhaustion and a reference is also suggested to what we have to say\r\nunder the heads of paralysis and locomotor ataxia.\r\n\r\nHeadaches or neuralgic pains, due to local irritations, as uterine\r\ndisease, stricture, neurotic or nerve tumors, pressure of trusses, eye\r\nstrain from weakened eye muscles, or lenses that need the help of proper\r\nspectacles, require for a permanent cure the removal of the cause.\r\nSciatic neuralgia, one of the most common and painful forms of nerve\r\nirritation, is particularly amenable to treatment by the modern means of\r\ncure used in our practice at the Invalids' Hotel.\r\n\r\nWe find, as a rule, that severe headaches and neuralgias are but the\r\nforerunners of more serious conditions, and are therefore deserving of\r\nspecial attention. They should be corrected as early as possible, before\r\nany organic changes have occurred.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPARALYSIS OR PALSY;\r\n\r\nLOCOMOTOR ATAXIA AND KINDRED AFFECTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nParalysis is an affection characterized by loss of muscular power or by\r\nthe sense of touch, taste, sight or smell becoming impaired from injury\r\nto a nerve by accident or disease.\r\n\r\nThe disease is sometimes due to simple lack of nerve force or power.\r\nThis may come from interference with the blood supply of the nerve\r\ncentres, as in hysterical palsy and reflex paralysis. Frequently the\r\npower of speech is affected in this way, ability to remember and\r\ndifficulty in pronunciation of certain words being the most common.\r\nCertain affections of the womb and its appendages, in women, and, in\r\nmen, stricture of the urethra, adherent prepuce, or foreskin, with\r\nwounds and injuries, many times of nerves and organs remote from the\r\nparalyzed points, cause the loss of power.\r\n\r\nTHE CAUSES OF PARALYSIS are very numerous. Whatever destroys, or impairs\r\nthe natural structure of nervous matter, or whatever interferes\r\nmaterially with the conducting power of nerve-fibre, or the generating\r\npower of the nerve-centres, will produce a paralysis, the extent of\r\nwhich will depend upon the amount of nervous matter affected. Thus\r\nparalysis may be due to disease of the brain arising from apoplexy; to\r\nabscess, softening, syphilitic or other tumors, or epilepsy; to disease\r\nof the spinal cord, or marrow; to disease of the structures which\r\nsurround the spinal cord, producing pressure upon it; to injury or\r\ncompression of a nerve, by which its conducting power it impaired; to\r\nthe effects of diphtheria, hysteria, or rheumatism. It may also be due\r\nto poisoning of nervous matter with opium, lead, arsenic, or mercury; or\r\nto the retention of poisonous substances which are generated in the\r\nliving body and which should pass off through the excretory organs, as\r\nthe elements of the urine and bile.\r\n\r\nMembers of consumptive families are very prone to paralysis.\r\n\r\nWe also find that the disease is often the result of some nervous\r\nstrain, or over excitement The over indulgence of the passions is\r\nparticularly a fruitful source of injury to the brain and spinal\r\ncentres. An angry man or woman uses up more nerve energy in a few\r\nminutes than would be sufficient to serve the muscles with stimulus\r\nthrough hours of toil.\r\n\r\nThe young, in unnatural indulgence of the sexual passions, waste the\r\nvigor and energy of maturity. Sexual excesses must be put down as among\r\nthe most prolific causes of this terrible malady. Ignorance shields no\r\none from the consequences of violations of the laws of health.\r\n\r\nThe passion for wealth with its ceaseless toil, continuous strain, and\r\nrapid exhaustion of the nerve forces, usually brings its devotee into\r\nthe same condition of discord as does the abuse of a stimulant. For a\r\ntime the system will repair and bolster up the weakness, but the longer\r\nthe day of reckoning is postponed, the more serious and terrible is the\r\ncollapse.\r\n\r\nSuch individuals need only an exposure to cold, or an over indulgence of\r\nsome kind, to suddenly precipitate a paralysis.\r\n\r\nGENERAL PARALYSIS. This term is applied to paralysis affecting the arms\r\nand legs. In this form of paralysis there is generally more loss of\r\nmotion than of sensation, and the mind is usually more or less affected.\r\n\r\nHEMIPLEGIA, or paralysis of one side of the body, is generally spoken of\r\nas a \"stroke of palsy.\" Sometimes only one extremity, the arm, is\r\naffected. Only occasionally is the face involved. In the majority of\r\ncases the mind is affected, the memory being poor, the sufferer becoming\r\nmelancholy, peevish, and fretful.\r\n\r\nIn paralysis of the right side, there is sometimes a curious\r\nforgetfulness or misplacement of language, the patient being unable to\r\nthink of words to express his thoughts. This condition is called\r\n_aphasia_. It is usually the result of some injury or disease of the\r\nbrain, almost invariably the side of the brain opposite the affected\r\nhalf of the body. In some cases it is due to a wasting, or softening, of\r\nthe brain substance, on account of insufficient nourishment, a deficient\r\nsupply of blood; whilst in others, it is due to just the opposite\r\ncondition, an excess of blood, producing rupture of some blood-vessel,\r\ntransudations, and pressure.\r\n\r\nPARAPLEGIA, or paralysis of the lower half of the body, is the result of\r\ndisease of the spinal marrow. The paralysis may occur suddenly, but, in\r\nthe majority of cases, it comes on slowly and insidiously, with weakness\r\nand numbness of the feet and legs, or with tingling and a sensation\r\nresembling that produced by ants creeping on the surface of the skin. By\r\ndegrees the weakness increases, until there is complete loss of both\r\nmotion and sensation in the feet and legs. The lower bowel and bladder\r\nare generally involved, and as a result, the patient suffers from\r\nconstipation, and retention and dribbling of urine. Although completely\r\nparalyzed, the patient is often tormented with involuntary movements and\r\ncramps in the affected muscles.\r\n\r\nParaplegia may be caused by various injuries of the spinal cord; by\r\ncongestion, degeneration, or hemorrhage; by pressure from thickening of\r\nthe sheath of the cord, or from tumors, or from disease of the bones and\r\ncartilages of the spinal column. Paraplegia may also be produced through\r\nreflex action, by an irritation, or injury to some organ or part of the\r\nbody distant from the spinal cord; thus, irritation of the skin, or of\r\nthe bowels from the presence of worms, or disease of the bladder or of\r\nthe womb, may produce paraplegia.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCOMOTOR ATAXIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nLocomotor ataxia, or creeping palsy, is also called progressive\r\nparalysis. This affection consists of a disease of the nervous matter in\r\nthe posterior columns of the spinal cord. It usually affects first the\r\nlower part of the cord, and those portions of the nerve matter that\r\nsupply the muscles of the legs. In other cases it first affects the\r\nportions of the spinal cord that supply the arms. In most cases of this\r\ndisease there is an early stage in which the patient suffers from\r\n\"lightning pains,\" as they are called. These are of a severe, stabbing,\r\nboring character, very sudden in their onset, and at times so serious as\r\nto have induced suicide. These paroxysms, in the milder form of the\r\ndisease, are not so severe, and are readily controlled by anodynes. They\r\nmay affect the stomach, and be mistaken for dyspepsia, or the rectum,\r\nand be taken for fissure or piles. At times they affect the bladder,\r\nwhen the symptoms are not unlike those of stone or cancer. In many cases\r\nwe find the patient has been treated for a long period of years for\r\nrheumatism, sciatica, or neuralgia, when the real disease has been this\r\nprogressive paralysis in its earlier stage. Sometimes the disease takes\r\nthe form of spermatorrhea or impotency; in other cases it is manifested\r\nin weak eyes, disturbances of vision, or cross-eyes. Sooner or later,\r\nthere appears the peculiar paralysis of the disease, which consists of\r\nmore or less numbness of the feet and legs, and, in the later stages, of\r\nthe hands and arms, sometimes of the face. As a rule, however, the\r\npatient finds difficulty in properly maintaining his balance, and in\r\nwalking his movements are tottering, like a man partially intoxicated.\r\nIt is difficult for him to maintain his balance and walk with his eyes\r\nclosed. If the arms are affected, their movements are uncertain. In\r\nguiding a needle or in buttoning or unbuttoning the clothing, there is\r\nan inability to move the hand with rapidity and certainty, or to any\r\nportion of the face or body if the eyes be closed. The eyes and\r\nattention must be constantly directed to the motion that is about to be\r\nperformed, or it is imperfectly done. The brain centres in this case\r\nsupply the weakened action of the spinal cord, and the stimulus to the\r\nmuscles is directed by the intelligence instead of being automatic, as\r\nin health, and due to spinal action. Still later, the voluntary\r\nmovements become spasmodic or jerking. The neuralgic pains often become\r\nvery distressing; there is often a sense of constriction around the\r\nlimbs or body, as if they were encircled with tight cords. In extreme\r\ncases locomotion becomes impossible, the patient is unable to bring the\r\nhand to the mouth, and the speech may become impaired, articulation\r\nbeing difficult and imperfect. In all cases there is more or less loss\r\nof sensation in the lower limbs, the patient generally being usable to\r\ndistinguish between two points and one, even when the two, are a\r\nconsiderable distance apart. The inability to feel the contact of the\r\nground or floor with the feet occasions the difficulty in walking. THE\r\nCAUSES of this disease are somewhat obscure, but unquestionably exposure\r\nto cold and dampness, and over-mental work, are largely instrumental in\r\nits production. Scrofula and syphilis favor its development, while abuse\r\nof the nervous system, such as results from over-indulgence of the\r\nanimal and reproductive instincts, are frequent sources of the nervous\r\nchanges that lead to ataxia.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHAKING PALSY.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Shaking Palsy, or Paralysis Agitans_, is an affection dependent upon\r\ndegenerative changes in the nervous centres. It is characterized by a\r\ntremulous agitation, or continual shaking, beginning in the hands, arms\r\nor head, and gradually extending itself over the entire body. The\r\ndisease progresses slowly, but when far advanced the agitation is\r\nviolent, and the patient swallows and masticates his food with great\r\ndifficulty. In an advanced stage of the disease, the body becomes bent\r\nforward, and the chin almost touches the breast-bone. The tremor, which\r\nearly in the disease only occurred during the time the patient was\r\nawake, now continues during sleep, and not infrequently the agitation\r\nbecomes so violent as to waken the sufferer.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL TREATMENT OF PARALYSIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe indications of treatment for the various forms of paralysis are to\r\nremove the causes, if these can be determined, and rouse the functions\r\nof the paralyzed parts. Measures should be adopted to remedy the morbid\r\nconditions upon which this affection depends. Keep the skin clean and\r\nhealthy, promote the circulation of the blood, especially in the\r\nparalyzed limbs, and encourage healthy nutrition. These ends may be best\r\nattained by the daily employment of stimulating baths and frictions upon\r\nthe surface. As much regular exercise as the patient can bear without\r\nfatigue should be taken in order to favor the preservation of the\r\nappetite and strength. Care should also be taken that the bowels are\r\nevacuated regularly every day. The circulation through, and consequently\r\nthe nutrition of, the palsied muscles may be aided by having a strong\r\nhealthy person knead and manipulate them. These manual movements upon\r\nthe surface of the body will often excite muscular sensibility, similar\r\nto that awakened by a weak Faradic current. The internal medicines\r\nshould be such as to regulate the general functions of the system. The\r\nuse of these remedies must be directed by the skill and experience of\r\nthose who are professionally qualified to administer hem.\r\n\r\nWhen the patient has been able to be under our personal care at the\r\nInvalids' Hotel, we have found the employment of mechanical movements\r\nand manipulations, applied by means of a variety of machinery, employed\r\nin this Institution, together with the use of the equalizer, or large\r\ndry cupping, or vacuum apparatus, to be of the greatest benefit. These\r\nseveral machines and apparatus furnish a perfect system of physical\r\ntraining, thus rendering valuable aid in the cure of many forms of\r\nobstinate chronic diseases. A few of these machines are shown in Figs.\r\n9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14; also see page 32 of Appendix.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.\r\nManipulator Extended.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.\r\nManipulator Folded.]\r\n\r\nThe general practitioner often endeavors to overcome the inertia of the\r\nnerve-centers and nerves by means of specific irritants, with the view\r\nof exciting the power-producing function, of compelling the weakened and\r\ndisabled centers to evolve more power. By such stimulation and forcing,\r\nhe places a burden on the weakest parts. The compulsory and ineffectual\r\nendeavor of the weak parts to act in response to such stimulation is\r\nvery liable to make undue drafts upon the capacity to act, which only\r\nend in exhaustion of the little remaining power instead of its\r\nre-enforcement. Cases which were previously curable by direct and\r\nappropriate means, are thus forever placed beyond the reach of remedies.\r\nNo powerful stimulating or depressing medicines are indicated in any of\r\nthe various forms of the affection. In paralysis it should be our aim to\r\nimprove local and general nutrition, to relieve local congestions and\r\ninflammations, to produce absorption of deposited matters, and to force\r\nan abundance of blood through palsied muscles, from which they may\r\nderive a proper supply of nutriment, and to which they may give up the\r\nproducts of waste. All this can be accomplished by massage, mechanical\r\nmovements, regulation of the atmospheric pressure on the body, baths,\r\nand proper physical culture.\r\n\r\nIn paralysis, there is a diminution or total loss of the contractile\r\nproperty of the muscles to which the affected nerve fibers are\r\ndistributed; consequently the capillaries and small veins are not\r\ncompressed, as in health, and the blood is not forced on through them\r\ntowards the heart; hence there is a backing-up of the circulation,\r\npassive congestion, and all the evils incident to that condition ensue.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.\r\nOscillating the Arms and Chest.]\r\n\r\n_Mechanical movements_ properly applied to the affected limbs, or parts\r\nof the body, accomplish the same results as contraction of the muscles.\r\nThey compress the capillaries and veins and thus force the blood on\r\nthrough these vessels towards the heart. There is a constant pressure in\r\nthe arteries, hence the flow of blood in the capillaries is always\r\ntowards the veins, and, when it gets into the veins, it is prevented\r\nfrom flowing back by the valves in those vessels.\r\n\r\nA proper circulation of the blood through the disordered parts is thus\r\neffected, and, as the result, they receive an abundance of nutriment,\r\nand their waste products are promptly carried away to the excretory\r\norgans, by which they are separated from the body; the deposits of fatty\r\nmatter between the muscular fibers are absorbed, and the agglutinated\r\nfibers are separated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.\r\nRubbing the Legs.]\r\n\r\nAs proof of these statements, it has been found by experiment and\r\nobservation that there is an increase of temperature in the parts\r\nsubjected to this action, which _must_ be due mainly to an increase in\r\nthe chemico-vital changes that are superinduced by the nutritious\r\nelements of the arterial blood, particularly that element which is\r\nsupplied to it by the inspired air, oxygen. All the products of waste\r\nare increased. The skin becomes more soft and moist, showing that the\r\namount of matter eliminated by it is increased. The urine becomes more\r\nabundant, and the relative amount of urea, its most important\r\nconstituent, becomes greatly increased. The amount of carbonic acid gas\r\nexhaled is increased, and further evidence in the same direction is\r\nfurnished by the very marked increase in the inspiratory acts,\r\nnecessitated by the increased demands for oxygen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.\r\nOscillating the Legs.]\r\n\r\nThe local increase of the circulation incident to properly applied\r\nmechanical movements, must produce a corresponding diminution of blood\r\nin other, even in remote, regions of the body. Thus this treatment, by\r\nits revulsive effects, is capable of relieving various disorders of the\r\nhead, chest, digestive organs, and pelvis. Nowhere, however, is the\r\neffect more satisfactory than in affections of the brain and spinal\r\ncord, whether characterized by loss of power, of sensation, or by\r\nneuralgic pain. Any portion of these nerve centres suffering from\r\ncongestion, will find prompt relief in mechanical vibratory movements.\r\n\r\nTHE MOVEMENT CURE which we advocate is not a \"Swedish Movement Cure,\"\r\nnor anything akin to it. It is the application of remedial forces by\r\ncomplex structures, which combine a variety of mechanical powers. The\r\ninventions are solely American.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.\r\nApparatus for Rubbing in a Recumbent Position.]\r\n\r\nBy means of this machinery, which is driven by steam power with great\r\nvelocity, we are able to apply _soft, pleasant, rapid vibrating\r\nmovements_ over the surface of the body, and thereby increase the\r\ncirculation of blood through the parts, raise the temperature, and\r\nexcite pleasant sensations. The movements can be applied by our\r\ningeniously-devised machinery to any part of the body through the\r\nclothing and _without the least exposure of the person._ They can be\r\nadministered in a great variety of ways, by light, quiet persuasions, by\r\ngentle frictions, by rubbing, by oscillations, by kneadings, by circular\r\nmovements, in fact, by an almost _endless variety_ of reciprocating and\r\nalternating motions, which, if described, would convey to the mind of\r\nthe reader but a faint conception of their remedial value.\r\n\r\nVIBRATORY MOTION not only establishes activity of the circulation\r\nthrough the skin and muscles, but it also affects profoundly the\r\ncirculation in the important and vital organs of the body; it is thus\r\ncapable of overcoming torpidity or congestion of the liver, spleen, and\r\nother deep-seated organs, without the depressing effects which sometimes\r\nfollow the administration of powerful medicines.\r\n\r\nIt has not been our purpose to literally explain, in detail, the methods\r\nof applying vibratory motion in the treatment of paralysis for popular\r\nexperiment, since to be successful one should become an expert, not only\r\nin this mechanical treatment, but also in the diagnosis of the various\r\nforms of paralysis, as well as familiar with their causes, pathology,\r\nand remedial requirements. Thus, to be successful in the treatment of\r\nparalysis and other nervous diseases, by the application of motor forces\r\nwith our ingeniously-contrived machinery, the cost of which is beyond\r\nthe means of most invalids, one must exercise great discretion.\r\n\r\nGRATIFYING SUCCESS. Not only is vibratory motion as a remedial agent\r\nrational and philosophical, but our experience has fully demonstrated\r\nits marvelous effects in the treatment of paralysis in its various\r\nforms, and also in the cure of other chronic diseases. We have cured\r\ncases of infantile paralysis which had resisted the skill of the most\r\nrenowned physicians in our country. We have treated those who could not\r\nstand or bear the weight of the body, but who have been so far restored\r\nas to be able to walk and run without assistance. Writer's and telegraph\r\noperator's paralysis, or cramp, we have cured in a few weeks' time.\r\nClub-feet, spinal curvature, and other deformities resulting from\r\nparalysis, have been successfully treated in our Institution. In short,\r\nour success has been most flattering in all curable cases of paralysis,\r\nand it is such experience that induces us to hold out encouragement to\r\nthose who are afflicted with paralysis and other nervous affections.\r\n\r\nVibratory motion is a desideratum of priceless value to those who are\r\nafflicted with diseases of the nervous system, as well as to all others\r\nwho need a gentle stimulus to call forth their latent energies and\r\nimprove their physical condition.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECAPITULATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nMotion, properly transmitted to the human system by mechanical\r\napparatus, is transformed into other forms of force identical with vital\r\nenergy, by which the ordinary processes of the system are greatly\r\npromoted.\r\n\r\nIt increases animal heat and nervous and muscular power to the normal\r\nstandard.\r\n\r\nIt removes engorgement or local impediments to the circulation.\r\n\r\nThe electrical induction produced, renders it a most efficacious remedy\r\nfor paralysis of all kinds.\r\n\r\nIt removes interstitial fluids and causes rapid absorption and\r\ndisappearance of solid and fluid accumulations.\r\n\r\nIt is a powerful alterative, or blood-purifier, increasing oxidation and\r\nstimulating excretion.\r\n\r\nIt diminishes chronic nervous irritability and promotes sleep.\r\n\r\nIt hardens the flesh by increasing muscular development and improves\r\ndigestion and nutrition.\r\n\r\n\r\nANIMAL JUICES, OR EXTRACTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe use of animal, nerve and gland extracts has proven of surprising\r\nefficiency in the treatment of paralysis and locomotor ataxia. They\r\nfurnish a pabulum in concentrated form for the nourishment and\r\nrestoration of the weakened nerve cells and fibres.\r\n\r\nIn the vast majority of cases, we have been able, by the use of these\r\nrecently discovered curative agents, when assisted by other means at our\r\ncommand at the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute, to arrest the\r\nprogress of these nervous affections, hitherto so generally considered\r\nincurable, and bring about restoration of the paralysed functions and a\r\nrenewal of lost power.\r\n\r\nThese comparatively new remedial agents have been very thoroughly tested\r\nby us. Their merits are more fully considered in a preceding chapter of\r\nthis treatise, under the head of treatment for Nervous Exhaustion, or\r\nDebility.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEPILEPSY (\"FITS\").\r\n\r\n\r\nEpilepsy, or falling sickness, is a disease which is characterized by\r\nattacks of sudden loss of consciousness, together with convulsive\r\nmovements of the muscles. The paroxysms occur at irregular intervals,\r\nthe periods between them, in some cases, being only a few minutes or\r\nhours, while in others, several months elapse.\r\n\r\nThere are two classes of Epilepsy: 1st. The general form, with a\r\nconvulsion that usually involves all the muscles of the body\r\nsimultaneously. It begins suddenly with little or no warning, commonly\r\nwith a cry or scream. The convulsion may last several minutes and is\r\nfollowed by a deep sleep for some hours.\r\n\r\n2nd. The local or Jacksonian form in which the attack begins with a\r\npeculiar sensation in some particular region of the body, either in one\r\nextremity or one half of the face. This sensation is followed by a\r\ntwitching of the muscles of the part. The sensation and spasm extend or\r\nadvance gradually to other parts. Consciousness is not usually lost,\r\nthough it may be when the spasms culminate in a general convulsion.\r\n\r\nGreat weakness generally follows in the parts convulsed, gradually\r\npassing away. When the attack begins on the right side of the face it is\r\nassociated with an immediate inability to speak.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS. In the severe forms of the disease, the subject suddenly loses\r\nconsciousness and falls; there is rigidity of the muscles, which causes\r\na twitching of the face and limbs; the eyes are turned up, and there is\r\nfoaming at the mouth. In the severe form of the disease, the respiration\r\nis arrested, while in the milder attacks, the breathing is difficult,\r\nslow, deep, and snoring. With the commencement of the spasm, the tongue\r\nis sometimes caught between the teeth and severely bitten. During the\r\nparoxysm, the countenance changes from a livid hue to dark purple. The\r\nconvulsion continues from one to three minutes, and is followed by a\r\ndeep, sighing inspiration; the subject then sinks into a deep sleep,\r\nwhich continues for half an hour or longer. When consciousness is first\r\nregained, the subject appears confused, stupid, and usually complains of\r\nheadache. He has no recollection of what has occurred during the attack,\r\nhe pronounces words indistinctly, and if he attempts to walk, he\r\nstaggers like a drunken man. Sometimes, several attacks occur so closely\r\ntogether that there is no interval of consciousness between them.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, there are premonitory symptoms, such as giddiness,\r\ndrowsiness, headache, and irritability of temper, which warn the subject\r\nof an approaching paroxysm. Occasionally, a wave of cold commencing at\r\nthe feet and proceeding to the head, is experienced. This is called an\r\n_aura_. When it reaches the brain, the subject becomes unconscious,\r\nfalls, and the convulsion commences. If the disease be allowed to\r\nproceed unchecked, it almost invariably leads to great impairment of\r\nmind, insanity, or paralysis.\r\n\r\nCAUSES. The _predisposing causes_ are an hereditary tendency to the\r\ndisease, and everything which impairs the constitution and produces\r\nnervous prostration and irritability. Syphilis, phimosis, sexual abuses,\r\nuterine disease, and the use of alcoholic liquors are prominent\r\npredisposing causes. Many of the causes treated by us have been brought\r\non by masturbation. Others are the results of injury to the head. Often\r\nfracture of the skull is followed by epileptic attacks.\r\n\r\n_The exciting causes_ include everything which disturbs the equilibrium\r\nof the nervous system. Indigestible articles of food, intestinal worms,\r\nloss of sleep, great exhaustion, grief, anger, constipation of the\r\nbowels, piles, and uterine irritation may be enumerated among such\r\ncauses. Convulsions of an epileptic character may also be induced by a\r\npoisoned condition of the blood, from malaria and disease of the kidneys\r\nor liver.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. When the time of an expected paroxysm approaches, great care\r\nshould be exercised that the patient be not suddenly attacked while\r\ncarrying a lighted lamp, or that he does not fall in some dangerous\r\nplace, strike upon a heated stove, or in some similar way inflict great\r\ninjury. If there be warning symptoms before the attack, the subject\r\nshould carry a vial of the _nitrite of amyl_ in the pocket, and, when\r\nthe premonitory symptoms are felt, two or three drops should be poured\r\non a handkerchief and held about an inch from the nose and inhaled,\r\nuntil flushing is produced, or a burning sensation is felt in the face.\r\n\r\nDuring the paroxysm, the subject should be laid on the back, with the\r\nhead slightly elevated, and the clothing about the neck and waist, if\r\ntight, should be loosened. If there be sufficient warning, a folded\r\nnapkin, or a soft pine stick covered with a handkerchief or cloth,\r\nshould be placed between the double teeth, to prevent the tongue from\r\nbeing bitten. During the fit, the head may be bathed with cold water.\r\n\r\nA person who suffers from this disease should avoid everything which\r\ntends to excite the nervous system, or increase to any great extent the\r\naction of the heart. The sufferer should go to bed at regular hours, and\r\ntake at least eight hours sleep. The sleeping-room should be large and\r\nwell ventilated, and the patient should lie with the head elevated. All\r\nindigestible articles of food should be avoided and the diet should\r\nconsist principally of bread, vegetables, milk, and fruits. Meat should\r\nbe taken but once a day, and then in very small quantities. The use of\r\nalcoholic liquors and coffee should be avoided, and tea only taken in\r\nsmall quantities. The bowels should be regulated with Dr. Pierce's\r\nPleasant Pellets and injections, if necessary. A thorough bath should be\r\ntaken once or twice a week. If the attacks occur at night, the body\r\nshould be sponged before going to bed with tepid water, to which should\r\nbe added sufficient tincture or infusion of capsicum, or red-pepper, to\r\nrender it stimulating to the skin.\r\n\r\nThe causes, if they can be determined, should be removed, and those\r\nremedies administered which relieve nervous irritability and cerebral\r\ncongestion. If due to worms, the proper remedies should be given; if to\r\nphimosis, the subject should be circumcised; if to pressure on the\r\nbrain, from fracture of the skull, trephining should be practiced, and\r\nthe depressed bone raised. There are no _specifics_ for this disease;\r\neach individual case must be treated according to the condition\r\npresented. The nostrums advertised extensively over the country as\r\nspecifics for this disease, while they may, in some instances, prevent\r\nthe attacks for a short time, irritate the stomach, impair digestion,\r\nlower vitality, and permanently injure the system, often rendering the\r\ndisease incurable. They deceive the sufferer, leading him to think that\r\nhis disease is being cured, until it progresses so far that he is beyond\r\nthe reach of any treatment. As a rule, the longer the disease\r\nprogresses, the more difficult it is to cure.\r\n\r\nEpilepsy has by many physicians been regarded as incurable, but our\r\nextensive experience has convinced us that by an appropriate course of\r\ntreatment, the _vast majority_ of cases can be cured. The animal\r\nextracts, or juices, herein more fully described under the head of\r\ntreatment for Nervous Exhaustion, have proven curative in some cases\r\nthat have resisted other remedies. This treatment requires the personal\r\nattention of a physician skilled in its employment. It is also of first\r\nimportance that the extracts be properly made. We have discovered\r\nseveral new remedies, which undoubtedly exert a powerful curative\r\ninfluence over this disease, but it is necessary to vary the treatment\r\nso much in different cases, that it would be useless to enter further\r\ninto details in this treatise.\r\n\r\nSURGICAL TREATMENT. A considerable proportion of those cases of\r\nepilepsy, termed Jacksonian, have been found to be caused by new growth\r\nupon, or in, the substance of the brain. Sometimes cysts form as a\r\nresult of small hemorrhages, or of spots of softening from clots in the\r\ncerebral arteries. Other cases are due to a small spot of hardened\r\ntissue or an inflamed centre of irritation in the outer gray matter of\r\nthe brain.\r\n\r\nThe majority of these forms of disease can be exactly localized in a\r\nsmall area of the brain, and may usually be traced to a blow or fall on\r\nthe head, or to fracture of the skull without depression. The discovery\r\nof the fact that such results of injury will produce localized spasm has\r\nnaturally lead to the conclusion that similar products anywhere in the\r\nbrain may give rise to epilepsy. In these cases trephining of the skull\r\nand the removal of irritation from the brain has been followed by the\r\nmost successful results. It is seldom a serious or dangerous operation,\r\nbut very few deaths having resulted in the practice of good surgeons in\r\nmany hundreds of cases, and these were individuals who were not\r\nfavorable for operation, and in whom it was undertaken as a last resort\r\n\r\nIn these cases of epilepsy, due to injury, the operation is fairly safe,\r\nand in carefully selected cases that have not been allowed to run so\r\nlong as to bring upon the brain a general epileptic tendency, the\r\nresults of operation are good and the procedure warrantable.\r\n\r\nSEE TESTIMONIALS FROM A FEW OF THE MANY CURES EFFECTED BY OUR\r\nSPECIALISTS.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHOREA (ST. VITUS'S DANCE).\r\n\r\n\r\nThis disease is an affection of the nervous system, which is\r\ncharacterized by spasmodic contractions of certain muscles. It may\r\naffect the entire body, although it is usually confined to the left\r\nside, or to a special group of muscles.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS. Twitchings of the muscles of the face are the most conspicuous\r\nsymptoms. They are at first comparatively slight, but as the disease\r\nprogresses, these spasms become more decided, and the face is twisted\r\ninto various shapes and forms. The head, in some cases, is constantly\r\njerking. It is with great difficulty that the tongue is thrust out of\r\nthe mouth, and then, with a sudden jerk, it is quickly withdrawn.\r\n\r\nThese spasms or contortions, may affect the extremities in a similar\r\nmanner, the hands and arms cannot be kept quiet, the gait may be\r\nunsteady, and one foot is merely dragged after the other. If one limb be\r\nforcibly held, to keep it quiet, some other limb will involuntarily\r\nmove. Strange as it may appear, these contractions, which cannot be\r\ncontrolled by the will during wakefulness, are very much lessened or\r\narrested by sleep.\r\n\r\nPrior to the development of the spasmodic affection, there is usually a\r\nperiod in which the sufferer notes a want of appetite, languidness, with\r\ndisinclination towards mental or bodily pursuits, headache,\r\nrestlessness, pains in the limbs and joints, with irritable temper and\r\nweakness of memory. There are many other symptoms in special cases. As\r\nthe disease develops, the patient gradually begins to exhibit an\r\nawkwardness of movement in the extremities, and objects frequently fall\r\nfrom the grasp. Children thus afflicted, spill their food while eating,\r\nand it becomes difficult for them to stand still. Attempts to write,\r\nsew, or draw are imperfectly performed. Such children are very often\r\npunished for supposed ill-behavior or careless habits. Later on the\r\nsymptoms become more unmistakable, and the presence of the disease is\r\nreadily recognized. The patient may become incapable of dressing, and\r\nthe limbs and face are no longer under the control of the will.\r\nUncontrollable movements of the fingers, hands, shrugging of the\r\nshoulders, dancing of the legs, grimaces of the face, and distortions of\r\nthe body, become more or less constant. Speech and swallowing may be\r\nseriously embarrassed. Any unusual excitement of the mind or body is apt\r\nto intensify the muscular twitchings. Severe mental application, the\r\nreading of exciting books, the witnessing of entertainments, and\r\nexcessive indulgence in sports, have to be discontinued.\r\n\r\nTHE MOST COMMON CAUSES seem to be exhaustion of the nerve centres, due\r\nto the appearance of the second teeth in children and the development\r\ncommon to the age of puberty. Other causes may be briefly mentioned as\r\nfollows: rheumatic affections, constipation, a morbid state of the\r\nblood, suppression of the menstrual function, uterine difficulties,\r\nmasturbation, or self-abuse, blows, injuries, or any cause which would\r\ngive rise to nervous debility. Sometimes it is caused by obstruction in\r\nthe alimentary canal, or by intestinal worms.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. The disease is one in which there is a debility of the nerve\r\ncentres, complicated with a lack of assimilation and digestion. There is\r\nno affection more amenable to treatment in its early stages than this.\r\nWe are daily in receipt of correspondence from sufferers, or their\r\nparents, or friends, in which the most gratifying relief and a cure has\r\nresulted from the use of Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription used in\r\nconjunction with Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery. These two\r\nremedies should be used alternately, the dose being suited to the age of\r\nthe patient.\r\n\r\nA large majority of the cases of chorea occur in females and at the\r\nperiod of life when the nervous system is subjected to unusual\r\nrequirements. In these cases the \"Favorite Prescription\" effects a\r\ngradual restoration of nervous energy, and improvement in the tone of\r\nthe nerve centres, and by its direct effect upon the circulation in the\r\novarian region, eliminates the most potent causes of debility. In young\r\npeople, we usually advise a dose of three drops for each year of the\r\nage. For instance, children of eight years of age should take\r\ntwenty-four drops; those of twelve, thirty-six drops; those of fifteen,\r\nforty-five drops, which is about two-thirds of a teaspoonful. A similar\r\ndose of Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery should be administered,\r\ntaking it before meals, and the \"Prescription\" after meals. Under their\r\nadministration the patient will rapidly improve in health and strength;\r\nthe circulation is materially bettered, the blood is purified, enriched,\r\nvitalized. The remedies effect a complete removal, from the blood, of\r\nthe impurities that represent nerve waste, and as a consequence the\r\nnerve cells are properly nourished. The disease is gradually controlled,\r\nand when the favorable influences of quiet, nourishing food, with plenty\r\nof outdoor air, and not too active exercise is added, the progress is\r\nmost gratifying. The patients, in a few weeks, are able to control much\r\nof the spasmodic movements, and gradually their restoration to a normal\r\ncondition is accomplished.\r\n\r\nIn occasional cases, where there is some complication, as rheumatism or\r\nother severe affection, complicating and preventing their recovery,\r\nspecial treatment is required. We are always ready to advise in regard\r\nto such cases when consulted either by mail or in person.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONIALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the following letters had been written by your best known and most\r\nesteemed neighbors they could be no more worthy of your confidence than\r\nthey are now, coming, as they do, from well known, intelligent and\r\ntrustworthy citizens, who, in their several neighborhoods, enjoy the\r\nfullest confidence and respect of all who know them.\r\n\r\nOut of thousands of similar letters received from former patrons, we\r\nhave selected these few at random, and have to regret that we can find\r\nroom only for this comparatively small number in this volume.\r\n\r\n\r\nNERVOUS AND GENERAL DEBILITY.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, 663 Main St., Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: T.M.

Before I consulted you I felt more\r\nlike taking my own life to end my miserable feelings than I felt like\r\nliving; I had given up all hopes of ever being any good to myself or\r\nanybody else, but, thank God, your encouragement, and kind words, and\r\nskillful treatment have made a different man of me.\r\n\r\nBefore I consulted you, I took no interest in business nor any thing\r\nelse in the world, which the wise Creator has placed in this world for\r\nall mankind to enjoy; but now my mind is clear, and I take an interest\r\nin business and enjoy life better than I ever did before.\r\n\r\nNow, may God bless you for your good and skillful treatment of me; and,\r\nalso, may this be the means of inducing others who are to-day suffering\r\nfrom the same complaint to at once consult you, as I can assure them\r\nthat they will receive full benefit of your kind attention, for moderate\r\ncharges.\r\n\r\n    Yours respectfully, T.M.

I was so nervous and low-spirited I could not sleep, in fact I\r\nwas just about as weak and low as I could be, and could scarcely drag\r\naround; but, after persevering for about twelve months, occasionally\r\nwith the help of your kind treatment and advice, I once more begin to\r\nfeel like myself again.

I tried some medicine that I bought from the druggist, which\r\ndid me little or no good; so, hearing of the World's Dispensary Medical\r\nAssociation, of Buffalo, I wrote them about my case, and in reply, they\r\nsaid they were sure they could cure me. At that time I was weak in my\r\narms and legs, had poor sight and, worst of all, I was very nervous and\r\nbashful. I could not sleep at night and feel refreshed in the morning. I\r\ncould not look any one in the eye without feeling ashamed.\r\n\r\nI have now taken two months' treatment and I feel sound in mind and\r\nbody; but to be sure I am going to take another month's treatment from\r\nthese same doctors in Buffalo.\r\n\r\nI recommend all men who are afflicted with any disease similar to the\r\none of which I have just been cured to apply to the World's Dispensary\r\nMedical Association, and if they take treatment from these doctors they\r\nwill surely be cured.

Spent about all the money I had in order to obtain\r\nrelief, but received little, if any good. I was scarcely able to work,\r\nwhen in July, 1887, I wrote to your Association, describing my case. You\r\nreplied, advising me, and prescribing a course of treatment, which you\r\nsent to me. After taking but a part of these medicines I began to feel a\r\ngreat deal better; could sleep very much better and was able to resume\r\nwork as usual, but still suffered some pain in head, and my buck was\r\nlame and weak. I continued treatment for some three or four months,\r\nuntil all remaining symptoms of distress and weakness had disappeared.\r\nAt the end of about eight months I found I felt as well as I ever did.\r\nMy weight had increased fully twenty pounds, and I could safely say that\r\nyou had effected a perfect cure in my case.\r\n\r\n    Respectfully yours,\r\n    THOMAS WESLEY KNAPP,\r\n    Myhart, Allen Co., Ind.\r\n\r\n\r\nNERVOUS AND UTERINE DISEASE.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, 663 Main St., Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mrs. Williams. ]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--I was sick for over three years with nervous complaint,\r\nwith blind dizzy spells, palpitation of the heart, pain in the back and\r\nhead, and at times would have such a weak tired feeling when I first got\r\nup in the morning, and at times nervous chills. At other times, I would\r\nfeel as if there were a tight bandage around my forehead.\r\n\r\nThe first physician I went to said I had nervous dyspepsia; the next one\r\ndid not say what he thought ailed me; the third said I had dyspepsia,\r\nbut none of them did me any good. As soon as I commenced taking Dr.\r\nPierce's Favorite Prescription, I began to get better; could sleep well\r\nnights, and that bad nervous feeling and the pain in my back soon left\r\nme. I can walk several miles without getting tired. I took in all, three\r\nbottles of the \"Favorite Prescription\" and two of Dr. Pierce's Golden\r\nMedical Discovery.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly,\r\n    MRS.

Your suggestion that I use Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical\r\nDiscovery was followed with good results, and I can say I felt the\r\neffects of it before the first bottle was finished. The dull pains in my\r\nback were leaving me very fast. I used three bottles of the \"Golden\r\nMedical Discovery.\" I had a dull pain in the back, restless sleep\r\nfollowed by very trying dreams, appetite poor, weakness, consequently\r\nvery easily tired. Now I can go about my work, walk twelve or fifteen\r\nmiles a day and not feel tired. When I commenced to use your \"Golden\r\nMedical Discovery\" I only weighed 125 pounds; now have increased to 150.\r\n\r\n    Yours respectfully,\r\n    W.C.

I had a heavy and languid feeling; dimness of sight, spots and\r\nflashes before my eyes; an \"all gone\" feeling in my stomach as if the\r\nbottom had fallen out; was nervous and irritable and felt like sinking\r\ndown when at work. I could hardly get up in the morning; it seemed as if\r\nI were more tired then I was when I went to bed. My appetite at times\r\nwas ravenous, and at other times the smell of food made me sick; I would\r\noften go from the dinner table and vomit. I would have spells when it\r\nseemed that every man was my foe and would be melancholy, and think that\r\nsomething was going to happen to me; was easily upset, could not get my\r\nmind to stay on anything long at a time. When I read about your\r\nremedies, I made up my mind to try them. After taking one month's\r\ntreatment I felt better, and kept on until I had taken three months'\r\ntreatment and was made a new man. I would advise any one who is in bad\r\nhealth to do the same, and will assure them that Dr. Pierce is a\r\ngentleman, and will do Just what he says, as he did in my case.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly,\r\n    MARIS H.

Had a terrible burning sensation across my shoulders,\r\nand my head felt large as two, and as if there was a hole from one ear\r\nto the other and all sounds passed right through. I could not see, nor\r\nsleep, nor scarcely eat, and was that nervous the least thing made me\r\nangry. I was treated by our home physician and given up as incurable.

Walton, Esq.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--I commenced treatment, I think, in July or August, of 1888,\r\nand continued four months. My case was nervous debility of fifteen\r\nyears' standing.\r\n\r\nI tried home doctors but found they were only aggravating my case. I\r\nalso tried the Remedy Company, then of St. Louis, who claimed to perform\r\nwonderful cures with their \"Pastiles,\" but they proved utterly\r\nworthless. Having come in possession of Dr. Pierce's little book and\r\ncirculars, a perusal of the same convinced me that my health would not\r\nbe trifled with at his Institution.\r\n\r\nI was a poor man and could not afford much experimenting. I ordered one\r\nmonth's treatment, and at the end of this first month, I found, to my\r\nsurprise, that I was feeling different. The second month, still more\r\nsurprised at my returning health. Third month thought I was cured, and\r\nengaged myself to a young lady, and wrote you to that effect, and you\r\nadvised me with your congratulations to marry, and to order another\r\nmonth's treatment; and at the end of the fourth month I was a _man_,\r\nsomething I did not know what it would be like to be before.\r\n\r\nI have now been married five years, and have two healthy children--a boy\r\nand a girl. I would never have dared to marry had it not been for your\r\nmedicines. I must add that during this treatment I was troubled with\r\nvaricocele on left side. I wrote you this at third month of treatment,\r\nand you sent without extra charge, a Suspensory and Lotion, and two\r\nmonths' treatment cured me sound and well of this distressing malady; I\r\nhave not felt the least symptoms of its return.\r\n\r\nI want the world to know what a competent and honorable firm the World's\r\nDispensary Medical Association is.

I had been in the habit of getting out with the\r\nboys and trying to see which could kick the highest with one foot on the\r\nground, and it caused me to have varicocele. I went to my home doctor\r\nand he treated me with no success. It was getting worse all the time and\r\nI got out of shape all over. My health got bad and I thought my case\r\nhopeless. I had tried two doctors and received no benefit.\r\n\r\nI had one of your little Memorandum Books in my pocket, and one day,\r\nlooking through it I saw you treated such cases, and wrote you and\r\nreceived word in a few days that you would treat me, so I sent off for\r\none month's treatment; and in five months I had gained my weight back,\r\nand that was eight years ago and I feel sound and well and my health has\r\nbeen good ever since.\r\n\r\nYou are at liberty to use my testimony in whatever way it may be of most\r\nbenefit to you.\r\n\r\nI also enclose a photograph of myself that was taken soon after your\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nWith feelings of much gratefulness, I am.\r\n\r\n    Very truly yours,\r\n    J.L.

I had\r\nbeen suffering for many months with general and nervous debility, with\r\nheadache, languor, sleeplessness, indigestion, constipation, etc., which\r\nwere increasing upon me. One month's treatment gave me perfect relief,\r\nand I am now like a new person.

I was considered near my grave by many of my friends when I\r\ncommenced treatment.\r\n\r\nI used eight months' special treatment, after which I used some 13 or 15\r\nbottles of your Sage's Catarrh Remedy, and have had excellent health\r\never since.\r\n\r\n    Yours truely\r\n    B.P.

About ten years ago I contracted rheumatism,\r\nfrom which I suffered dreadfully at times. Was also troubled with\r\nchronic constipation; had been from boyhood. Had doctored more or less\r\nfor years without any great benefit until I consulted you and commenced\r\ntaking your Special Remedies. After taking three courses of your\r\nmedicines I was so far improved in health and strength that I considered\r\nit unnecessary to continue it longer.\r\n\r\nWishing you much success in your great work.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly,\r\n    W.H.

The remedies\r\nput up by the specialist of this Institute so suited my case, and so\r\nimproved my health, that I soon felt like a new man. My gratitude is so\r\nheartfelt that I cannot speak to my friends and to all the afflicted in\r\ntoo high praise of the skill of the physicians of the World's Dispensary\r\nMedical Association and of the great benefit to be derived from their\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\n    Yours, truly,\r\n    LEVI RAKES,\r\n    Plattemouth, Cans Co., Neb.\r\n\r\n\r\nNERVOUS DEBILITY.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: T.J.

Esq.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--My health had been gradually failing for years. I could not\r\nsleep nights and was very nervous, and I was depressed in spirits and\r\nwas entirely unfit for business. The principal cause was over-work.\r\nThrough the influence of friends I began your treatment and continued it\r\nthree months, and at the end of that time I felt so much better that I\r\ndid not continue it longer.\r\n\r\nAnd I can cheerfully recommend your mode of treatment to every sufferer.\r\n\r\n    Sincerely yours,\r\n    GEORGE POSSON,\r\n    Middleburgh, Schobarie Co., N.Y.\r\n\r\n\r\nNERVOUS DEBILITY AND CATARRH.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y,:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mrs. Hoffman.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--I have enjoyed good health since I took your treatment I\r\nsuffered intense agony for five months, and after taking one month's\r\nmedicine I found very much relief--so much I was surprised.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for the good your medicines have done me, and my prayers are\r\nthat God may help you in your good work, and that you may live long and\r\nprosper.\r\n\r\n    Yours respectfully,\r\n    MRS.

They did not understand my\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nI was a nervous wreck--unable to sleep--could not eat, and underwent the\r\nusual horrors that one endures where there is loss of control of the\r\nnerves. A few months more would have made me insane.\r\n\r\nMy cure has remained permanent. The relief was something that I cannot\r\ndescribe. It has enabled me to pursue my work steadily ever since, and I\r\nam more than happy to testify to the excellent skill and honorable\r\ndealings of your faculty and the fine appointments of your Institution.\r\n\r\n    Respectfully yours,\r\n    FAYETTE MOFFATT,\r\n    Hendrum, Norman Co., Minn.\r\n\r\n\r\nNERVOUS DEBILITY,\r\n\r\nKIDNEY DISEASE, NIGHT-EMISSIONS, SEVERE HEADACHES, INDIGESTION,\r\nRHEUMATISM, COULD NOT SLEEP NOR REST.

I had no hope of ever being restored to\r\nhealth again, having tried several home physicians, and having found no\r\nrelief. I had little faith of ever being relieved of the dizzy spells\r\nand black spots before my eyes. Some of my friends told me it was\r\nnothing but a fake and a humbug. Thank God I did not listen to them. The\r\nfirst month's special treatment gave me such relief that I continued\r\nfive months, and to-day can do heavy work without that troublesome pain\r\nin my back, and can stoop down without dizziness in my head. I would\r\nadvise any one that is afflicted with any of these diseases to at once\r\nconsult the practical and skillful physicians at the World's Dispensary\r\nMedical Association, at Buffalo, N.Y.

For some time I hardly knew what course to pursue, nearly\r\nevery paper I might pick up contained some advertisement that would cure\r\nme. But believing in the old adage, \"never expect to get something for\r\nnothing,\" I decided to write to an Association that _I knew_ was\r\nreliable.\r\n\r\nActing accordingly, I took a course of four months' treatment, which I\r\nam pleased to state has given me in return a perfect cure.

I went to a doctor, who said I was suffering from\r\ndebility and ordered me away. I got a little better and returned to\r\nwork, but only to get worse again. I then had very restless nights with\r\nterrible dreams, and would wake up all in a perspiration. I often wished\r\nI was dead. At last, I had to give up work again, and thought that I\r\nshould never return to it. I was then under several doctors, but they\r\ndid me no good. I then came across a little book from your Association,\r\nand seeing cases like mine cured, I determined to come to London and see\r\nyou. I was then under your treatment for three months at my home, taking\r\nyour medicines and adhering to your rules. I felt a change the first\r\nweek, and after three months' treatment I was restored to health. It is\r\nnow four months since I took any of your medicine, and have not had any\r\nsymptoms return. I am now at work again, and enjoying life the same as\r\nanyone else. I thank you very much for your kind attention. I remain,\r\n\r\n    Yours truly, G.

So I went to my druggist\r\nand asked him for \"Golden Medical Discovery,\" and he had it and I bought\r\none bottle and followed the directions and it did me good at first\r\nstart; so I bought two bottles every month until I had used about six\r\nbottles, then I had my strength back and could draw my breath and felt\r\nlike a new man.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly,\r\n    CHARLES HOLMSTEDT,\r\n    Newtonville, Baraga County, Mich.\r\n\r\n\r\nNERVOUS EXHAUSTION.\r\n\r\nA PROMINENT NURSE AND STUDENT IN DISEASES OF FEMALES.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sarah Barnhardt.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--One could scarcely discharge a more pleasant duty to a\r\nsuffering fellow being than to direct them to a place of relief. Hence,\r\nI desire to state that a short time ago, life was almost a burden to mo\r\nuntil I began taking treatment for nervous exhaustion from Dr. Pierce of\r\nthe Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute, at Buffalo, N.Y., and can\r\nconscientiously say at the end of six weeks, I feel like another being.\r\n\r\nI have also consulted Dr. Pierce on numerous occasions during the past\r\neight years, and at no time whatever have I known his remedies to fail,\r\nmore especially, his \"Favorite Prescription,\" (which I have used in my\r\npractice), and the \"Golden Medical Discovery,\" when taken according to\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nThese remedies will in no event disappoint. I am now In the enjoyment of\r\nperfect health--a blessing which I attribute to the kind Providence\r\nwhich directed me to the World's Dispensary Medical Association.\r\n\r\n    Yours gratefully,\r\n    SARAH BARNHARDT,\r\n    Grand Rapids, Mich.\r\n\r\n\r\nNERVOUS EXHAUSTION.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, 663 Main St., Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: W.E. Dixon, Esq.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--It is over a year now since I applied to you for help and\r\nit is more than six months since I reported myself as well. I have\r\nworked very hard since then, and still have continued well all the time.\r\n\r\nWhen I called upon you for treatment I was in a terrible condition. I\r\nwas subject to severe headaches; was troubled with a tired, an almost\r\nlifeless feeling, and although I slept, _I could not get rest_. I was\r\nnervous and fretful, and could not do as much work as I wanted to do. To\r\ntell it all in a few words _I was all run down_. I had never wholly\r\nrecovered from the grip, which left me in a very poor condition; and\r\nthat, together with over-work and insufficient physical exercise, had\r\nput me in such a condition that I was almost unfit to teach my school.\r\n\r\nAfter five months' treatment (one month intervening in which I received\r\nnone) I considered myself well, and I think that I was right. I feel\r\nvery grateful to you for your treatment of me, and shall ever be willing\r\nto speak a good word for you.\r\n\r\n    Yours respectfully,\r\n    WILLIAM E. DIXON,\r\n    Harwich Port, Barnstable County, Mass.\r\n\r\n\r\nNERVOUS EXHAUSTION.\r\n\r\nDR. R.V. PIERCE, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Geo. S. Wilson, Esq.]\r\n\r\n_Dear Sir_--After being troubled with my head for two years and taking\r\ntreatment with ten different doctors and getting no help, I started for\r\nyour city, but allowed myself to be talked out of seeing you by a man on\r\nthe train; stopped off at Lancaster and saw Dr. ----, took one month's\r\ntreatment with no benefit--grew worse.\r\n\r\nAfter that, started once more, did not tell where I was going. I was a\r\ncomplete wreck--had to be helped on board of the cars. You looked me\r\nover carefully--you seemed to know just what the trouble was. Gave me\r\nmedicine for a month's treatment. I came back homo and took the\r\nmedicine. Well, I was surprised the first week and have been ever\r\nsince--gained right along. Have been well ever since and all for one\r\nmonth's treatment, for which I thank you very much.\r\n\r\n    Respectfully, GEO. S.

I can truly say I feel like a new man. I have\r\nnone of that wakefulness at night, or the tired feeling when I get up of\r\na morning. Now, I can work hard all day, go to bed at night tired, wake\r\nup the next morning rested and refreshed, though I took but two months'\r\ntreatment; its value to me I am not able to estimate; before and during\r\ntreatment I weighed about 160 pounds, and now I weigh 185 pounds.

I doctored with seven different doctors and got\r\nno relief; then I took almost all kinds of patent medicines and got no\r\nrelief from them, but got worse all the time, when I chanced to get one\r\nof your little pamphlets.\r\n\r\nI thought I would write to you, and waited as I thought to hear that\r\nthere was no help for me; when my answer came and you said you could\r\ncure me great was my joy. I had taken your medicine about a month when I\r\nbegan to improve and in a few months was entirely cured.\r\n\r\nMy recovery was like coming out of the dark into the light, so great was\r\nthe change. I will advise all sufferers to go to you for relief--I don't\r\nthink they will be disappointed. When I commenced taking your medicine I\r\nweighed 94 pounds, now I weigh 125 pounds.\r\n\r\nI do not know how to thank you for all the good your remedies did me,\r\nWith heart-felt thanks I am.\r\n\r\n    Sincerely yours,\r\n    MRS.

Your\r\nadvertisement fell into my hands; at the time I did not know what to do\r\nbecause all my money had gone for medicine, but money was no object to\r\nme. I could not rest till I was cured.\r\n\r\nYour treatment, which I received, cured me in a short time, and I am\r\njust as good as ever. I come before the public to advise anyone in need\r\nof treatment to give you the first chance, and he will find relief for I\r\nbelieve that nowhere can one obtain more skillful care or more kindly\r\nattention.

He was suffering from great nervous prostration; could not walk\r\nwithout tottering: was troubled greatly with inability to sleep; poor\r\nappetite; did not relish food; suffered much pain and stiffness in the\r\njoints; was overcome with heat working on a thresher, followed by\r\npersistent nausea, confusion of ideas, his memory being very defective.\r\n\r\nAfter taking a single course of treatment, the medicines being sent by\r\nexpress, he writes as follows: \"The medicine you sent me lasted me five\r\nweeks, and proved very beneficial indeed. I believe it, under God, was\r\nthe means of saving me from a premature grave. When I received the\r\nmedicine, I had just gotten rid of an attack of bilious fever, which\r\nleft me in a deplorable condition. I was very week and nervous, but my\r\nimprovement commenced with the first dose of your medicine, so by the\r\ntime my medicine was out felt better than I had for years, and now have\r\nno indication of a return of my trouble.\" A month later he writes: \"I\r\ncontinue to enjoy the most perfect health. Every organ of my body, and\r\nevery faculty of my mind, is in splendid condition, which makes life\r\nworth living. I have gained twenty-one pounds since I have been able to\r\nattend to business.

Colquitt, Esq.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--It gives me pleasure to testify to your skill in the\r\ntreatment of my case. When I applied to you last June, I was suffering\r\nall the horrors of nervous prostration, which was brought on by\r\nover-work and constant anxiety. I had no energy and no interest in\r\nbusiness; rather an aversion to anything like work. My appetite was\r\npoor, indeed food seemed to distress rather than nourish. I felt tired\r\nand drowsy mornings; irritable and despondent; suspicious of every body\r\nand everything. After two months' treatment these unpleasant symptoms\r\ndisappeared, and my health is better than it has been for twenty years.\r\n\r\nI can never express to you my gratitude for your kindness, and would\r\ncheerfully recommend your Institution to all sufferers.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly,\r\n    GEORGE W.

I did take your advice as near as I could; when I wrote my\r\nfirst letter to you, I had been treated by different doctors for twelve\r\nmonths and received but very little or no benefit, but had spent one\r\nhundred dollars for treatment and medicines.\r\n\r\nMy husband, and little boy twelve years old, did all the family sewing\r\nand washing and work in general, and I could not walk across the room\r\nwithout help or stand on my feet one minute at a time; at night I could\r\nnot sleep, nor day time either; nothing I ate tasted well--I had no\r\ndesire to eat anything; my bowels were costive all the time, and after\r\nfollowing your advice and using about fourteen dollars worth of your\r\nmedicines altogether, I now feel like a new person. I am not bothered\r\nwith that nervousness, where it used to be that I could not stand a\r\nsudden rush of horses feet, or a quick halloo from one's boys, or a\r\nsudden sound of anything would cause me to take sudden nervous spells of\r\nsome kind, as if I were smothering or dying, or something of the kind--I\r\ncan't tell just how I did feel. Now I do all my washing, sewing and\r\nhouse work in general for a family of seven--five children, my husband\r\nand self, and help my husband in the field some besides. I can\r\ntruthfully say, ii it had not been for Dr. Pierce's medicines and the\r\nkind advice to me, with self-treatment at home, I would have been dead\r\nlong ago, and I never can feel that I can say enough for his skill and\r\nmedicine nor thank him enough for the good he has done me.\r\n\r\nI use no other medicines in my family but these and never will, for they\r\ndo all that is claimed for them and more too. I have one of the\r\n\"Advisers,\" and I would not be without it for fifty times its cost. May\r\nGod be with you throughout your life is my prayer.\r\n\r\n    Respectfully yours,\r\n    MRS.

Nicholson, Esq.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--In January of '90 I took the \"grippe,\" went to work before\r\nI was well, was caught in a rain which gave me a very bad relapse,\r\nresulting in lung fever and complete prostration; was on my bed two\r\nmonths, and when I did get out, the strength to walk any more than just\r\na few rods did not come back. My family doctor and two prominent\r\nphysicians of Sioux City, did me no good. Late in the fall I got a\r\nbottle of Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery, which quieted my\r\ntrembling nerves and gave me an appetite to eat. I then concluded to try\r\nthe Doctor, personally. Up to this time I was in a pitiable condition.\r\nSometimes I could not sleep until I felt almost wild, then sleep so much\r\nI would be stupefied. I could not digest any food and my whole system\r\nwas wasting and failing fast. I doubt if any one who saw me expected me\r\nto get well. I took the treatment sent me by the World's Dispensary\r\nMedical Association for more than a year. The medicine never gave me any\r\ndistress as other medicines had done before. I began to improve from the\r\nstart, but the change from one extreme to the other was like the growth\r\nof a child.\r\n\r\nTo any one suffering from nervous prostration I would say, \"don't be\r\nimpatient.\" It takes a long time for weakened nerves to grow strong. I\r\nhave at last become strong and well, thanks to the Giver of all good and\r\nthe grand Institution at Buffalo. I have since married a noble-hearted\r\nyoung woman, and when I am playing with our sweet, healthy, baby girl, I\r\ngive way to the thought that at last the long, sad chapter of my life is\r\nended; at such times her merry laugh sounds like a song of triumph of\r\nlife over death.\r\n\r\n    Gratefully yours,\r\n    W.S.

I am sure that your Institution is far\r\nin advance of the age, and would wish that every invalid could avail\r\nhimself of the treatment that I received in your most, excellently kept\r\nInvalids' Hotel. I cheerfully give this as my testimonial to\r\nindividuals, friends and sufferers. My health is so fully restored that\r\nI look upon life with pleasure and comfort, whereas before I was a\r\nsuffering nervous invalid, unable to sleep and much of the time in\r\ntorment.

I explained my case carefully and got\r\none month's medicines, of which I did not take all as I thought I did\r\nnot need it, as I felt like another man--could sleep well and work\r\nwithout having that \"all-gone feeling.\"\r\n\r\n    Yours respectfully,\r\n    A.D.

I was placed under the treatment of a\r\ngood physician who did all in his power to restore my health, but all in\r\nvain. I had dyspepsia and could not eat meat, vegetables nor fruit of\r\nany kind. I suffered alternately from cold and heat. At times my feet\r\nand knees would feel like ice to the touch, and at other times I would\r\nsuffer the most excruciating torture, seeming as though every nerve in\r\nmy body was being seared with a hot iron. My left hip and knee would\r\nbecome so affected that I could scarcely walk across the room. I slept\r\nvery little. On one occasion I remained awake four days and four nights,\r\nand then was put to sleep by repeated doses of morphine. My nervous\r\nsystem became so shattered that words spoken by any person in my room\r\nfell like pebbles on my brain; and nights I would often have to be\r\nraised in bed to prevent smothering to death. It is impossible for me to\r\ndescribe my sufferings at that time but I know that if it had not been\r\nfor Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription I would to-day have been in my\r\ngrave.\r\n\r\nI began the use of the \"Favorite Prescription\" in March--three years\r\nago, as well as I can remember. Continued till summer when I wrote to\r\nyou--received your advice and a few simple prescriptions which I had\r\nfilled at the drug store. I also began the use of the \"Golden Medical\r\nDiscovery.\" My nerves became quiet: I slept well; my stomach began to\r\nheal; my strength returned and I began to feel like a new person. And,\r\nto-day, while I am not as strong as the strongest, I can do any kind of\r\nwork that other women do, and each season I can say I am stronger than I\r\nwas the last. I used thirty bottles of your medicines. Some may say that\r\nwas a great deal, but I will never regret the money and patience it took\r\nto cure me. It has enabled me to once more enter school where I am\r\ntrying to make up for those lost years of my life, and as I join the\r\ngirls in their romps, I can say that \"life is now sweet.\"\r\n\r\nAny one desiring particulars may address me.\r\n\r\n    Respectfully,\r\n    MISS LUCY MOYERS,\r\n    Kelso, Lincoln Co., Tenn.\r\n\r\n\r\nNERVOUS EXHAUSTION.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: W.H.

I could eat but\r\nvery little and could keep nothing on my stomach, and was vomiting up\r\nbile once or twice every day; muscles all gone and too weak to get\r\nabout.

I doctored with country and city M.D.'s., and took\r\npatent medicine, but without any permanent good. I was induced to write\r\nto you, which resulted in my taking about one and one-half months'\r\ntreatment from you, when I felt so much better that I discontinued the\r\ntreatment.

I was suffering from general debility, malaria and\r\nnervous sick headaches, and after my third child was born (a beautiful\r\nbaby boy of ten pounds) I only recovered after a long illness; I barely\r\ngained strength enough in two years time so that I was able to crawl\r\nabout to accomplish the little housework that I had, by lying down to\r\nread many times each day; had sick headaches very often; and many pains\r\nand aches, all the time complaining of getting no better. I finally\r\nasked my husband to get a bottle of Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription,\r\nwhich he promptly did. After I had taken one bottle I could see a great\r\nchange in my strength, and fewer sick headaches.\r\n\r\nI continued taking the medicine until I had taken eight bottles--seven\r\nof the \"Favorite Prescription\" and one of the \"Golden Medical\r\nDiscovery.\" For some time past I have not used it, but I am now able to\r\ndo the housework for myself, husband and two children (aged nine and\r\nfive years). I also take in dressmaking, and enjoy walking a mile at a\r\ntime, and I think it Is all due to the medicine, for I know I was only\r\nfailing fast before I commenced to take it. I take great pleasure in\r\nrecommending the \"Favorite Prescription\" to all women who suffer from\r\ndebility and sick headache.\r\n\r\n    Respectfully yours,\r\n    MRS. J.H.

At my dinner I eat my regular meal,\r\nand take one or two of Doctor Pierce's Pleasant Pellets immediately\r\nafter, and in the course of an hour my headache is cured and no bad\r\neffects. I feel better every way for having taken them--not worse, as is\r\nusual after taking other kinds of pills.

Having read about Dr. Pierce's Pleasant\r\nPellets, I commenced taking them. Before I had finished one phial I\r\nfound benefit; they have done me great good.

The Doctors are courteous gentlemen and the best\r\nPhysicians I have ever met with in my life. My treatment while at the\r\nInstitute did me more good in one month than all the doctors everywhere\r\nelse combined. My ailment was Paralysis and Female Weakness. Your\r\ntreatment did me good while at the Institute, and I have also been\r\ngreatly benefited by the home-treatment I have received from you since.\r\nI am much better than I was; I am able to do considerable work now. When\r\nI came to you I could not do anything.\r\n\r\nI herewith send you my heartfelt thanks for all you have done for me,\r\nand should I need more treatment I will write you as before. I would\r\nadvise all people who have chronic diseases to go to the Invalids' Hotel\r\nand Surgical Institute for help, for it is a grand place and prices are\r\nreasonable.

I value Dr. Pierce's\r\nGolden Medical Discovery and his \"Favorite Prescription\" very highly and\r\noften recommend them to others. I do not think I would ever have got\r\nwell if it had not been for your medicines. I was in a sad condition. My\r\nbowels and half of my body (the left side), was nearly paralyzed,\r\nbesides nearly my whole system was out of order. I suffered all the\r\ntime; but after taking six bottles of \"Golden Medical Discovery\" and the\r\nsame of \"Favorite Prescription,\" and using two bottles of Sage's Catarrh\r\nRemedy as an injection, I felt like a new person. I have never seen\r\nanyone suffering in the same way as I did. If anyone with female trouble\r\nof any kind will use your medicines I am satisfied they will help them.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly,\r\n    Mary A. Sallee.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCOMOTOR ATAXIA. SPECIAL TREATMENT.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Ltd., No. 3 New Oxford Street,\r\nLondon, W.C.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: C.F.G. Castleman, Esq.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--In the latter part of 1890, I was struck down with that\r\nterrible--and by many members of the medical profession pronounced to\r\nbe, incurable disease, locomotor ataxia. My family doctor declared that\r\nnothing could be done for me, but for the sake of satisfaction advised\r\nme to go to London, and see an expert, whom he named. I did so, with the\r\nresult of being told as above. This was in November, 1890. The symptoms\r\nwere first numbness in hands and feet, which soon extended as far as the\r\nthighs, joined with the most intense feeling of cold that it can be\r\npossible to imagine. For six months I felt as though I had stood in ice\r\nup to my thighs. I soon became unable to walk or to stand, and crawled\r\nup stairs on my hands and knees, I thought for the last time, as I then\r\nthought I should die. Stomach troubles then set in, and for more than\r\nthree months, I endured the utmost agony. Night and day sweats absorbed\r\nmy little remaining strength, and I became helpless. I had taken leave\r\nof my family, not expecting to last the day out, when I was seen by a\r\nyoung doctor, who is fast becoming an eminent man, who said he thought\r\nhe could alleviate my sufferings--though he did not expect to cure me.\r\nHe commenced to treat me, and in about one month I began to improve,\r\nthough very slowly. This was in February, 1891, and before the end of\r\nthe year I was able to walk down stairs again. It was in March, 1892,\r\nthat I began taking Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery, and on\r\nsending to you for a bottle in reply to your inquiry, I began your\r\nspecial treatment, with the happy result that I gradually improved in\r\nhealth and strength; and on the 26th of October, 1892, I was able to\r\ncall on you in London, and you advised me to continue your treatment,\r\nand use a battery as well, which I did until April, 1893, when I could\r\nwalk about quite nicely, and I now enjoy better health than for the past\r\neight years. I am thankful too, that my eldest daughter has derived the\r\ngreatest benefit from Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription. She took it\r\nfor painful menstruation, and is now well and healthy.

He was very bad, as we\r\nthought, for the physician could do nothing for him any more, and I got\r\ndiscouraged and went to my daughter, Mrs. D.T. Knappenberger, of\r\nJeannette, Pa., (who has been a terrible invalid and was cured at your\r\nInstitute), for advice. 'Oh, father,' she said, 'don't doctor here, but\r\ngo to Dr. Pierce. So the result was I gave her money and she sent for\r\nmedicines. You sent two bottles of medicine and he never has taken a\r\ndrop since and is perfectly well and never had a spell since. I do not\r\nknow what you call the disease, but we called it spasms or fits. With my\r\nexperience I can heartily recommend the Invalids' Hotel, and think if a\r\ncase can be cured at all, you can cure it. And unless they can cure or\r\ngreatly benefit the patient, they will not undertake it; this is my\r\nexperience with the World's Dispensary.

When three and one-half years old we discovered she had that\r\nterrible disease \"epilepsy,\" inherited from her father's family; she had\r\nspasms or fits once in two or three days, and grew worse so rapidly that\r\nin four months she had from four to eight fits in twenty-four hours.\r\nHome physicians did no good, and just then one of your little pamphlets\r\ncame to me as they had come often before. As my need was great I wrote a\r\ndescription of her case, and though your answer did not seem very\r\nencouraging, I did not dare to lose any chance of saving my child, so I\r\ncommenced the treatment. On November 6, 1891, she had seven fits;\r\nNovember 7th gave her your medicines; she had four fits that day, and\r\nnever one since. She took your medicines less than four months. She is\r\nnearly six years old, a strong, hearty, bright child, attending school\r\nevery day.\r\n\r\nWhat more can I say than that I thank Dr. Pierce and the Faculty of the\r\nWorld's Dispensary Medical Association for having saved the life of my\r\nchild, and I thank God that he gave them the knowledge and skill to do\r\nso.\r\n\r\n    Respectfully yours,\r\n    MRS.

She had been afflicted with epilepsy for three and a half\r\nyears, and received treatment from three different doctors, and from one\r\nespecially, for the space of two years steady, without any benefit.\r\nBefore taking your treatment she had as many as six or seven spells a\r\nday. The child could not have stood it much longer. After taking your\r\ntreatment one month the spells stopped. With four months' special\r\ntreatment from you, and two months' use of Dr. Pierce's Favorite\r\nPrescription she was entirely cured. In one year and three months she\r\nhas not had a drop of medicine, and she is in the best of health and\r\nvigor.\r\n\r\nI would say to any sufferer from obstinate or chronic disease, and\r\nespecially epilepsy, that we have a living witness.

While there I saw a man\r\nwho had been cured by the specialists, who had before been given up to\r\ndie by the best doctors in Troy, N.Y. Of course, the case must have been\r\na very stubborn one. I afterwards saw a man here, in Georgia, die, who,\r\nif he had been in Pierce's Surgical Institute under the treatment and\r\ncare of his skilled doctors and nurses, I know would have most assuredly\r\ngot well. Why? Because it was only a case of _stone in the bladder_, and\r\nthey are easily cured at Dr. Pierce's Surgical Institute. I think almost\r\nany chronic disease can be cured there, if taken in time, judging from\r\nmy observations while an inmate of that Institution.\r\n\r\n    H.E.

While there I saw\r\nand talked with a groat number of people who came there as a last\r\nresort, to be cured of almost every chronic disease to which flesh is\r\nheir, and they were unanimous in their praise of the Institution and the\r\nskilled specialists who constitute its professional staff.\r\n\r\n    ANDREW HOLES,\r\n    Moorhead, Minn.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nOUTLINE OF THE FEMALE URINARY AND GENERATIVE ORGANS.\r\n\r\nThe above cut is introduced here to assist in conveying a correct idea\r\nof the Urinary and Generative Organs of Woman, their form and relative\r\npositions, together with the bones, muscles and other tissues forming\r\nthe cavity of the pelvis in which the organs rest, and by which they\r\nare protected. By dividing that portion of the body directly through\r\nthe middle from before backward, we first cut through the cushion of\r\nfat (mons veneris) covering the pubic bone, then in succession the\r\nbone, bladder, womb, vagina, rectum, front half of spine, spinal\r\nmarrow, rear half of spine, and lastly the muscles and skin. Just\r\nunderneath the bone in front is revealed that sensitive organ, the\r\nclitoris, a facsimile of the male organ in miniature, the head of\r\nwhich protrudes, while the body is covered with tissue, but is readily\r\ntraced with the finger. Further back is the urethra, or water passage,\r\nwhich is one and a half inches long. Next is the vagina. When closed,\r\nits mucous lining is folded in upon itself, and requires dilating in\r\norder to be cleansed and to apply remedies. On the vagina rests the\r\nhollow, pear-shaped womb, the small end of which protrudes into the\r\nvagina, and in which is a small opening, leading through the neck into\r\nthe cavity of the organ. On either side of the womb, near its top, are\r\nthe Fallopian tubes leading to the ovaries, situated between the womb\r\nand hip bones. At every menstruation these organs throw off a\r\ngerm-cell, which passes through the Fallopian tubes into the uterine\r\ncavity.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DOOR OF LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe fear of pain and the dangers of childbirth fill many a woman's\r\nbreast with dismay. In the olden days of leeches and witchcraft, it was\r\nconsidered sacrilegious to lessen the pains of labor. Latterly,\r\nanæsthetics have been used at the time of parturition, and now people\r\nare beginning to find out that pain and danger can be almost wholly\r\navoided.\r\n\r\nProper preparation during gestation will make both as rare as they used\r\nto be common. There is no reason why childbirth should be fraught with\r\ndanger and distress. It is a perfectly natural function, and should be\r\nperformed in a natural way without undue suffering. Nature never\r\nintended that women should be tortured when doing the one thing which\r\nmakes them wholly womanly. The perversion of nature's laws has brought\r\nthis suffering about, and a return to right living will stop it.\r\n\r\nNine out of ten women are troubled more or less by weakness and diseases\r\npeculiar to their sex. It is so because they do not take proper care of\r\nthemselves--because they neglect little ills and little precautions. A\r\nwoman in perfectly hearty health goes through her time of trial with\r\ncomparative ease. The thing to do then, is to make all pregnant women\r\nhealthy--to strengthen them generally and locally. The medicine and\r\ntonic to do it with is Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription.\r\n\r\nIt is a powerful invigorant and nervine. It soothes and strengthens the\r\nnerves and acts directly on the feminine organism in a way which fits it\r\nfor the proper and regular performance of all its functions at ill\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nTaken during gestation it robs childbirth of its dangers to both mother\r\nand child, by preparing the system for delivery, thereby shortening\r\nlabor, lessening pain and abbreviating the period of confinement. The\r\nFavorite Prescription also promotes the secretion of an abundance of\r\nnourishment for the child, if taken after confinement, besides building\r\nup the mother's strength and making her recovery more perfect.\r\n\r\n\r\nABORTION. (MISCARRIAGE.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe term _abortion_ is used to denote the premature expulsion of the\r\nfoetus. If the expulsion takes place within four months after\r\nimpregnation, it is termed _abortion_; if between the fourth and seventh\r\nmonth, _miscarriage_; if after the seventh month, but before the\r\ncompletion of the full period of gestation, _premature labor_.\r\n\r\nAbortion may be due to those agents which act directly upon the uterus\r\nand cause the expulsion of the foetus; to those which occasion the death\r\nof the foetus, thereby effecting its ejection; and it may be _criminal_,\r\nthat is, produced intentionally by direct agencies intended for that\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS. The premonitory symptoms are pain in the loins and lower part\r\nof the back, a dull pain in the abdomen and thighs, nausea, chills, and\r\npalpitation. The membranes and blood-vessels of the uterus become\r\nlacerated, causing profuse hemorrhage. The discharge of blood from the\r\nvagina is sometimes attended with excessive pain.\r\n\r\nTHE CAUSES which act directly upon the uterus to produce abortion may be\r\nviolent exercise, lifting, accidents, or injuries from blows or falls.\r\nNervous susceptibilities, a plethoric condition of the system, anæmia,\r\nexhaustive discharges, use of improper food, uterine displacements,\r\ncongestion caused by excessive sexual excitement, general debility or\r\nmuscular irritability, which is sometimes so great as to produce\r\ncontractility of the uterus before the term of pregnancy is completed,\r\ninflammation of the cervix, ulcerations of the uterus, or any previously\r\nexisting disease may produce abortion. When it has once taken place, it\r\nis apt to recur at about the same time in subsequent pregnancies.\r\n\r\nThe death of the foetus may be occasioned by a diseased condition of the\r\nembryo, amnion, or placenta, and also by convulsions or peritoneal\r\ninflammation.\r\n\r\nCRIMINAL ABORTION is secretly practiced by women who desire to rid\r\nthemselves of the evidence of immorality, and by those in wedlock who\r\nwish to avoid the care and responsibility of rearing offspring.\r\nStatistics show that it is very prevalent, undermining the health of\r\nwomen and corrupting the morals of society. We cannot pass over this\r\nsubject in silence. Those who frustrate the processes of nature by\r\nviolating the laws of life incur just penalties. All the functions of\r\nlife and body are vitally concerned in reproduction. Any infraction of\r\nthe Divine law, \"Thou shalt not kill,\" is inevitably followed by\r\npunishment. The obligations to nature cannot be evaded without\r\ninevitable penal effects. Furthermore, all such transgressors carry with\r\nthem the consciousness of guilt and the feeling of secret woe.\r\n\r\n    \"O God! that horrid, horrid dream\r\n      Besets me now awake!\r\n    Again, again, with dizzy brain.\r\n      The human life I take,\r\n    And my red right hand grows raging hot,\r\n      Like Cranmer's at the stake.\"--HOOD.\r\n\r\nWhat shall we say concerning abortionists, men and women who are willing\r\nto engage in the murder of innocents for pay? True, there may be\r\ncircumstances in which it is not right to continue in the pregnant\r\ncondition, such as when the children of an unfortunate marriage are\r\nidiots, or the pelvis of the woman is so deformed that she cannot bear a\r\nliving child. All such cases should be submitted to the _family_\r\nphysician, who ought to be made acquainted with all the circumstances\r\nand facts relating to the case, when he can summon other physicians for\r\ncounsel, and their deliberations may determine the propriety or\r\nnecessity of bringing on an abortion.\r\n\r\nParties have written to us and others have made personal application\r\nunder circumstances when it might have been right for their _family\r\nphysician_ to have induced abortion. We wish to have it distinctly\r\nunderstood that we will not under any circumstances prescribe medicines\r\nor perform any operation to relieve women of pregnancy.\r\n\r\nMechanical means are resorted to by abortionists, and many women produce\r\nabortion upon themselves. It always terminates in lasting injury and\r\nsometimes in speedy death. Certain medicines will sometimes produce\r\nabortion but they are very unsafe. An opinion is very prevalent that if\r\nabortion be produced before the movements of the foetus are felt, there\r\nis no crime committed. It should be remembered that _life begins with\r\nconception_, and, at whatever period of pregnancy abortion is committed,\r\n_life is destroyed_. Whoever disobeys the Divine injunction cannot\r\nescape his own consciousness of the deed, and the anguish and bitter\r\nremorse which ever after disturb the soul.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. In threatened abortion, there is pain in the back or lower\r\npart of the abdomen, and later some flow of blood. The first object is\r\nto obtain perfect rest and quiet, and assume the recumbent position. By\r\nlying down, the blood will be more easily diverted to the surface of the\r\nbody. Gallic acid, in doses of five grains every two or three hours, is\r\noften a valuable agent to arrest the hemorrhage, but opium in some form\r\nshould be relied upon principally. A Dover's powder, ten grains, may be\r\nadministered, to assist in determining the blood to the surface and\r\nextremities of the body and to allay irritation. The room should be\r\ncool, the patient should lie on a hard bed, and all company should be\r\navoided, for excitement favors abortion. If the flow of blood equals a\r\ngill in amount, there is little hope of preventing abortion, and the\r\ntreatment of the case should be entrusted to the family physician.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWOMAN AND HER DISEASES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn imaginative poet avers that woman is the link connecting Heaven and\r\nearth. True it is, we see in her the embodiment of purity and heavenly\r\ngraces, the most perfect combination of modesty, devotion, patience,\r\naffection, gratitude and loveliness, and the perfection of physical\r\nbeauty. We watch with deep interest the steady and gradual development\r\nfrom girlhood to womanhood, when the whole person improves in grace and\r\nelegance, the voice becomes more sonorous and melodious, and the angles\r\nand curvatures of her contour become more rounded and amplified,\r\npreparatory for her high and holy mission.\r\n\r\nThe uterus, or womb, and ovaries, with which her whole system is in\r\nintimate sympathy, render her doubly susceptible to injurious influences\r\nand a resulting series of diseases, from which the other sex is entirely\r\nexempt. By their sympathetic connections they wield a modifying\r\ninfluence over all the other functions of the system. Physically and\r\nmentally, woman is man modified, perfected,--the last and crowning\r\nhandiwork of God. When, therefore, this structure so wonderfully\r\nendowed, so exquisitely wrought, and performing the most delicate and\r\nsacred functions which God has ever entrusted to a created being, is\r\ndisturbed by disease, when the nicely-adjusted balance of her complex\r\nnature deviates from its true and intended poise, the most efficient aid\r\nshould be extended, in order that the normal equilibrium may be\r\nregained, her health restored, and her divine mission, on which human\r\nwelfare so largely depends, be fulfilled. Its importance should elicit\r\nthe best efforts of the highest type of mind, the ripe development of\r\ngenius, and the most scientific administration of the choicest, rarest,\r\nand purest medicinal elements in the whole range of nature.\r\n\r\nA VAST EXPERIENCE. As the remedial management of diseases of women has,\r\nfor many years, entered very largely into our practice at the Invalids'\r\nHotel and Surgical Institute, located at 663 Main Street, Buffalo, N.Y.,\r\ncomprising the treatment of many thousands of cases annually, we have\r\nbeen afforded great experience in perfecting and adapting remedies for\r\ntheir cure, enabling us to meet their requirements with increased\r\n_certainty_ and _exactness_.\r\n\r\nTREATING THE WRONG DISEASE. Our improved and perfected system of\r\ndiagnosing, or determining, the _exact_ nature and extent of chronic\r\naffections, which, in most cases, we are able to do at a distance, and\r\nwithout a personal examination of the patient, as will be more\r\nparticularly explained in the appendix, or latter part of this little\r\nbook, has enabled us to avoid the blunders so often committed by the\r\ngeneral practitioner, who not infrequently treats those afflicted with\r\nchronic ailments peculiar to women, for long weeks, and perhaps months,\r\nwithout ever discovering their real and true disease, or condition.\r\nThus, invalid women are often uselessly subjected to treatment for\r\ndyspepsia, heart disease, liver or kidney affections, sick headaches,\r\nand various aches and pains, as if they were _primary_ diseases, when in\r\nreality, they are only so many local manifestations, or _symptoms_, of\r\nsome overlooked derangement, or disease, of the womb. For, as we have\r\nalready intimated, every organ of the system is in _intimate_ sympathy\r\nwith the uterus, or womb. Any disease, either functional or organic, of\r\nthis organ, is at once manifest through several, if not all, the\r\nsympathizing organs of the system. When we receive a sharp blow upon the\r\nelbow, the pain is felt most keenly in our little finger. Just so in\r\ndiseases of the womb; often the most distress is felt in organs or parts\r\nof the system quite distant from the real seat of disease. On this\r\naccount, thoughtless, easy-going and ignorant physicians are misled, and\r\nvery commonly mistake the invalid's disease for some affection of the\r\nstomach, heart, liver, kidneys, or other organ, when really it is\r\nlocated in the uterus. Cure the disease of the womb, and all these\r\ndisagreeable manifestations, or symptoms, vanish. Their cause being\r\nremoved, the various dependent derangements, and disagreeable nervous\r\nsensations and sufferings rapidly give way, and vigorous health is\r\nfirmly re-established.\r\n\r\nTIME AND PERSEVERANCE IN TREATMENT REQUIRED TO CURE. Most chronic\r\ndiseases of women are slow in their inception, or development, and their\r\nremoval or cure must necessarily be gradual. Disease that has been\r\nprogressing and becoming more firmly established for months, or perhaps\r\nyears, cannot, except in rare cases, be hastily dislodged, and the\r\nsystem restored to perfect health. The process of cure, like the\r\ndevelopment and progress of the disease, must be a gradual one,\r\naccomplished step by step. Often, too, the use of medicines that, if\r\n_persisted_ in, will prove beneficial and curative, will, for a\r\nconsiderable time, arouse in the system very disagreeable sensations,\r\nand many times this leads unthinking persons to become frightened or\r\ndiscouraged, and to quit the treatment best adapted to their cases if\r\nonly faithfully carried out. In many forms of womb disease, their are\r\norganic lesions or changes, that can be repaired only by a gradual\r\nprocess, just as an external wound would heal,--not suddenly, but by a\r\nconstant, slow filling in and building up, or by the gradual development\r\nor growth of one cell upon another. Just as a great breach in a wall\r\nwould be repaired by filling in brick upon brick, until the defect is\r\neffaced, so must these lesion's be removed by gradual processes. When\r\nfully repaired, the dependent, sympathetic derangements, disagreeable\r\nsensations, and all the long train of consequential symptoms are, one by\r\none, abolished.\r\n\r\nNOT LIMITED IN OUR REMEDIAL RESOURCES. It should be borne in mind that,\r\nwhile we recommend, in this little volume, certain courses of treatment\r\nfor ordinary cases, the remedies mentioned do not by any means embrace\r\nall our resources in the way of medicines and other curative agencies,\r\nespecially for complicated, difficult, or very obstinate cases. In many\r\nof the latter class we can send medicines that are exactly adapted to\r\nthe case, if the invalid will fill out one of our \"Applications for\r\nTreatment,\" which may be found folded in the latter part of this book,\r\nor which will be sent to any address, on application, by mail. In most\r\nwomb diseases, the chemical and microscopical examination of the urine\r\nalso furnishes valuable aid in determining the exact condition of the\r\npatient, as well as the precise stage of the local organic disease. Full\r\ndirections for putting up and sending such samples may be found in the\r\n\"Appendix\" of this little volume. Every case submitted to us, either by\r\nletter or in person, receives the careful and deliberate consideration\r\nof a full Council of specialists before a decision as to the nature of\r\nthe malady, or the proper course of treatment to be employed, is\r\ndetermined upon. The great advantage of this system of practice must be\r\nobvious to every intelligent, thoughtful person. No experimenting is\r\never resorted to. The treatment is _specially_ and _exactly_ adapted to\r\neach individual case, which requires such judgment, skill, and nicety of\r\ndiscrimination, as has only been acquired by our specialists through\r\nlong and diligent study, and an experience embracing the treatment\r\nannually of many thousands of cases of those chronic diseases which are\r\npeculiar to women.\r\n\r\n    WORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION,\r\n    663 Main Street, Buffalo, N.Y.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMENSTRUATION AND ITS DISORDERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe function of the ovaries is to furnish ova or germs, and the\r\nfunctions of the uterus or womb are to secrete mucus; to exude the\r\nmenses; to secrete the decidua; to contain and nourish the foetus and to\r\neffect its expulsion.\r\n\r\nMenstruation, or the menses, monthly visitation, catamenia, menstrual\r\nflow, courses, or periods, usually makes its appearance in the female\r\nbetween the twelfth and fifteenth years, at which time the reproductive\r\nsystem undergoes remarkable changes. A marked characteristic of\r\nmenstruation is its regular return about every twenty-eight days. The\r\nmenstrual flow usually continues from three to six days, and the\r\ndischarge seems to be ordinary blood, which, during its vaginal passage,\r\nbecomes mixed with mucus, and is thereby deprived of the power of\r\ncoagulation. The quantity exuded varies from two to eight ounces, but\r\nthe amount consistent with the health of one person, may be excessive\r\nand weakening in another. This function is regarded as \"being regular\r\nwhen its effect upon the system is favorable, for whatever organic\r\nprocess directly contributes to the health should be considered as\r\nnormal. It occurs at regular intervals for about thirty years, when\r\nmenstruation and the aptitude for conception simultaneously cease.\r\n\r\nThe departures from healthy menstruation are numerous. The most\r\nimportant of these are _amenorrhea, dysmenorrhea_, and _menorrhagia_.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMENORRHEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe term _amenorrhea_ signifies the absence of menstruation when it\r\nshould occur. It may be considered under two general heads: when it\r\nfails to be established at the proper age, and when, after having made\r\nits appearance, it ceases to return at the usual periods. The term\r\n_retention_ has been applied to the first, and that of _suppression_ to\r\nthe latter. Menstruation may fail to be established in consequence of\r\norganic defects, or from some abnormal condition of the blood and\r\nnervous system.\r\n\r\nMALFORMATION OF THE VAGINA. Retention of the menses may result from\r\nmalformation of the vaginal canal, which sometimes terminates before it\r\nreaches the womb, being simply a short, closed sac. If the uterus and\r\novaries are perfect, all the feminine characteristics are manifest, and\r\na vaginal exploration discloses the nature of the difficulty. If,\r\nhowever, the sides of this passage adhere in consequence of previous\r\ninflammation, they may be carefully separated by a surgical operation,\r\nand this function restored.\r\n\r\nABSENCE OR MALFORMATION OF THE WOMB. The uterus may be deformed or\r\nentirely absent, and yet there be an inclination, or symptoms indicative\r\nof an effort, to establish this function. The individual may be delicate\r\nin organization, graceful in bearing, refined and attractive in all\r\nfeminine ways, and yet this organ may be so defective as to preclude the\r\nestablishment of the menstrual function. Sometimes there is merely an\r\nocclusion of the _mouth_ of the uterus, the perforation of which removes\r\nall difficulty. In others, the _neck_ of the womb is filled with a\r\nmorbid growth, or the walls of its canal are adherent, as the result of\r\ninflammation, and may be separated by a small silver or ivory probe, and\r\nthe menses be thus liberated.\r\n\r\nIMPERFORATE HYMEN. The hymen is a circular, or semilunar membrane, which\r\nimperfectly closes the outer orifice of the vagina in the virgin. When\r\nof a semilunar shape, it usually occupies the lower or posterior portion\r\nof the canal, leaving an opening in the upper or anterior portion,\r\nvarying from the size of a quill to that of a thimble, through which the\r\nmenstrual fluid exudes. This membrane is usually ruptured and destroyed\r\nby the first sexual intercourse, and, hence, its presence has been\r\nconsidered evidence of virginity. Its absence, however, must not be\r\nconsidered a conclusive evidence of sexual intercourse, for, as Dr.\r\nDunglison says, \"many circumstances of an innocent character may\r\noccasion a rupture or destruction of this membrane. It is often absent\r\nin children soon after birth; while it may remain entire after\r\ncopulation. Hence, the presence of the hymen does not _absolutely_ prove\r\nvirginity; nor does its absence prove incontinence, although its\r\npresence would be _prima facie_ evidence of continence.\"\r\n\r\nSometimes this membrane, when not imperforate, is so thick and strong as\r\nto render sexual intercourse impossible, and requires a cutting\r\noperation to open the vagina. Several such cases have been operated upon\r\nat the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute.\r\n\r\nIt occasionally happens that the hymen is entire, or imperforate, at\r\nbirth. This may not be discovered before puberty. But when this period\r\narrives and the menstrual discharge takes place into the vagina, the\r\nfemale will suffer from the retention and accumulation of this\r\nsecretion, and ultimately a tumor or a protrusion of the membrane which\r\ncloses the vagina will occur, giving rise to severe pain and other\r\nserious symptoms. The retained menstrual fluid, increasing in quantity\r\nat every monthly period, dilates the womb as well as the vagina, and\r\neven the Fallopian tubes become distended, presenting at length an\r\nurgent necessity for relief.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. This condition admits of relief only by operative surgery.\r\nThe operation consists in dividing the hymen by a crucial incision, thus\r\nallowing the accumulated fluid to be discharged, after which the vagina\r\nis cleansed by syringing it with warm water.\r\n\r\nABSENCE OF THE OVARIES. Let us suppose the case of a young woman who has\r\nfully reached the period of puberty without having menstruated. All the\r\norgans which we have described, are manifestly developed, she is\r\nhealthy, vigorous, robust, and able to exercise freely or to engage in\r\nlaborious occupations. But we notice that her voice is not sweetly\r\nfeminine, nor is her presence timid, tender, and winning; there is\r\nwanting that diffident sexual consciousness, which gently woos, and, at\r\nthe same time, modestly repels, and tends to awaken interest, curiosity,\r\nand desire. Considering also that she has never manifested any\r\ninclination to menstruate, we are irresistibly led to the conclusion\r\nthat the ovaries are wanting; the delicate mustache upon the upper lip,\r\nthe undeveloped breasts, the coarse features, and her taste for\r\nmasculine pursuits, all concur in this diagnosis. Thus we account for\r\nthe harshness of the voice, fitted for command rather than to express\r\nthe mellow, persuasive cadences of love. Such a malformation cannot be\r\nremedied.\r\n\r\nRETENTION AND SUPPRESSION FROM MORBID CONDITIONS OF THE BLOOD.\r\nNon-appearance, as well as suppression of the menses, may result from an\r\nabnormal state of the blood. The first condition which demands our\r\nattention under this head is _plethora_. In robust, plethoric females\r\nthe menses are sometimes very tardy in their appearance, and every month\r\nthe attempt to establish this function is attended with pain in the\r\nhead, loins, and back, chilliness, nausea, and bloating of the abdomen.\r\nSometimes there is intolerance of light or sound, and cerebral\r\ncongestion, amounting almost to apoplectic symptoms. The pulse is full\r\nand strong, the blood abundant and surcharged with red corpuscles. Such\r\npersons may be accustomed to luxurious living, and there is evidently a\r\npredisposition to abnormal activity of the alimentary functions.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. We may briefly suggest that such subjects should engage in\r\nlaborious physical exercise in order to expend the surplus of vitality,\r\nand should lessen the daily amount of food taken, and use that which is\r\nlight and unstimulating. We should also prevent the determination of\r\nblood to the head, by keeping it cool and the feet warm, and by\r\nincreasing the flow of blood to the extremities. The volume of the\r\ncirculation may be diminished by acting upon the natural outlets, such\r\nas the skin, kidneys, and bowels. The proper means and appliances for\r\nquickening the circulation of the blood are indicated, and friction upon\r\nthe surface, bathing, the daily use of such cathartics as Dr. Pierce's\r\nPleasant Pellets, and, finally, the use of some general uterine\r\nstimulant, such as Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription, will generally\r\nprove successful in cases of amenorrhea resulting from plethora.\r\n\r\nRETENTION AND SUPPRESSION FROM ANÆMIA. To describe the condition of the\r\npatient whose blood is low and deprived of the richness, warmth, and\r\nbloom, it once possessed when it kindled admiration and enthusiasm in\r\nothers, is but to give a picture of a numerous class of female invalids.\r\nIt is sad to see beauty fading, vigor waning, and Bright's disease or\r\nconsumption slowly wasting the blood and consuming the vital cells,\r\nuntil the spirit can no longer dwell in its earthly abode and death\r\nclaims the skeleton for dust.\r\n\r\nCHRONIC DECLINE, with its attendant anæmia, may be induced by bad\r\nhabits, destitution, or constitutional depravity. Sickly forms, wrecks\r\nof health, address our senses on every side. All these subjects\r\nevidently once had a capital in life, sufficient, if properly and\r\ncarefully husbanded, to comfortably afford them vital stamina and length\r\nof days. Alas! they have squandered their estate, perchance in idleness\r\nand luxurious living, or have wasted it in vanities or misdirected\r\nambition. Having become bankrupts in health, there is necessarily a\r\nfailure of the menstrual function, and then follows a _panic_. All the\r\nblame of the insolvency and general derangement, is unjustly attributed\r\nto the non-performance of the duties of the uterus. Thus, this organ is\r\naltogether _dependent_ Upon the general health for its functional\r\nability, yet frequently treatment is instituted to compel menstruation,\r\nregardless of the condition of the system. Thus the enfeebled uterus is\r\nwrongfully held responsible for general disorder, because it ceases to\r\nact, when _by acting_ it would further deplete the blood and thus\r\nmaterially contribute to the already existing chronic decline.\r\n\r\nNo matter what are the causes of this decline, whether they are the\r\nfollies of fashion, the effect of indolence, debility in consequence of\r\ninsufficient food, perversion of nutrition by irregular habits, lack of\r\nexercise, or the taking of drastic medicines, the result is anæmia and\r\namenorrhea.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. We would suggest in such cases a nutritious diet, increased\r\nexercise, cleanliness, regular habits, hard beds, and useful employment.\r\nThe diet may be improved by animal broths, roasted meats, fresh beef,\r\nmutton, chicken, or eggs, and the dress should be comfortable, warm, and\r\npermit freedom of motion. The patient should indulge in amusing\r\nexercises, walking, swinging, riding, games of croquet, traveling,\r\nsinging, percussing the expanded chest, or engage in healthful\r\ncalisthenic exercises. The hygienic treatment of this form of\r\namenorrhea, then, consists in physical culture, regular bathing, and the\r\nregulation of the bowels, if constipated, as suggested in this volume\r\nunder the head of constipation.\r\n\r\nThe _medical treatment_ should be directed to enriching the blood,\r\nimproving nutrition, toning up the generative organs, and the health of\r\nthe whole system. This requires the employment of uterine and general\r\ntonics, and Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription, which is sold by\r\ndruggists, happily combines the properties required. It improves\r\ndigestion, enriches the blood, exercises a tonic and gently stimulating\r\neffect upon the uterus and ovaries, and thus promotes the function of\r\nmenstruation. It is not a strong emmenagogue, but operates slowly, yet\r\nsurely, and in accordance with physiological laws, being eminently\r\ncongenial in its effects upon the female system, and, hence, not liable\r\nto do harm. There is danger in employing active driving medicines,\r\nbesides, no emmenagogue, however powerful, can establish the menstrual\r\nfunction so long as the system is in a debilitated condition and the\r\nblood reduced. The restorative effects of the \"Favorite Prescription\"\r\nshould be secured by administering it regularly, in from one to two\r\nteaspoonful doses, three or four times a day, for several weeks, and as\r\nthe system is built up and those symptoms appear which indicate a return\r\nof the menses, their visitation may be encouraged by the use of hot foot\r\nand sitz-baths, and free doses of Dr. Pierce's Compound Extract of\r\nSmart-weed. But the latter should only be used when symptoms of\r\napproaching menstruation are manifested. By following out this course of\r\ntreatment, a soft flush will gradually take the place of the pallor of\r\nthe cheeks, the appetite will return and the health will be restored.\r\n\r\nACUTE SUPPRESSION OF THE MENSES may be caused by _strong emotions,_ as\r\nexcessive joy, or by violent _excitement_ of the _propensities_, as\r\nintense anger, sudden fright, fear, or anxiety. Suppression may result\r\nfrom sudden exposure to cold, immersion of the hands or feet in cold\r\nwater, drinking cold water when the body is heated, sitting on the cold\r\nground or damp grass, or from a burn or wound. It is not uncommon for\r\nwomen to labor in the heated wash-room, pounding, rubbing, and wringing\r\nsoiled linen, thereby overtaxing the delicate physical system. While\r\nfeeling tired and jaded, all reeking in perspiration, they rinse and\r\nwring the clothes out of cold water and hang them upon the line with\r\narms bare, when the atmosphere is so freezing that the garments stiffen\r\nbefore they finish this part of the task. Is it any wonder that acute\r\nsuppressions occur or that inflammations set in?\r\n\r\nThe symptoms which naturally follow are a quick pulse, hot skin, thirst,\r\nfever, headache, and dizziness, and the inflammation may locate in the\r\novaries, uterus, lungs, bowels, brain, or other parts. No matter what\r\norgans are attacked the menses are suppressed. The suppression can\r\ngenerally be attributed to an adequate cause, resulting in\r\nconstitutional disturbance. The severity and duration of the attack and\r\nthe power of the constitution to resist it, must determine the gravity\r\nof the consequences.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. As acute suppression of the menses is due to derangement of\r\nthe circulation of the blood, caused by taking cold, by violent\r\nexcitement of the propensities or excessively strong emotional\r\nexperience, the prominent indication is to secure its speedy\r\nequalization. Give a hot foot, a warm sitz, or the spirit vapor-bath and\r\nadminister full doses of Dr. Pierce's Compound Extract of Smart-weed, to\r\nproduce free perspiration. Dr. Eberle, a very celebrated medical author,\r\nsays that he used the Extract of Smart-weed in twenty cases of\r\namenorrhea, and affirms, \"with no other remedy or mode of treatment have\r\nI been so successful as with this.\" Our experience in the use of the\r\nExtract has been equally satisfactory. Should this treatment not\r\nestablish the function, Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription should be\r\ngiven three times a day until the system is invigorated, say for\r\ntwenty-eight days, when the above course may be repeated, and generally\r\nwith success. Should the case be complicated with inflammation of the\r\nlungs, brain, or other vital organs, manifesting alarming symptoms, the\r\nfamily physician should be called. The treatment should be active and\r\nsuited to the indications of each particular case. When the disease\r\nbecomes chronic, the active stage of symptoms having passed, and it\r\ncontinues to linger without making the desired improvement, all the\r\nmeans suggested for the treatment of suppression from anæmia should be\r\nemployed. Their use will be followed by the most gratifying results. It\r\nshould be borne in mind, however, that when we have suggested any\r\ntreatment in this volume, it is generally such as the family may\r\ninstitute and apply, and does not, by any means, represent the variety\r\nor extent of the remedial resources which we employ when consulted in\r\nperson or by letter. We refer our readers to only a few of the safe and\r\nreliable remedies which we have prepared and placed within their reach,\r\nand give them just such hygienic advice as we think will best serve\r\ntheir interests.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDYSMENORRHEA.\r\n\r\n(PAINFUL MENSTRUATION.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dysmenorrhea_, from its Greek derivation, signifies a _difficult\r\nmonthly flow,_ and is applied to menstruation when that function becomes\r\npainful and difficult. Menstruation, like other healthy operations of\r\nthe body, should be painless, but too frequently it is the case, that\r\ndiscomfort and distress commence twenty-four hours before the flow\r\nappears, and continue with increasing pain, sickness at the stomach, and\r\nvomiting, until the patient has to take to the bed. When the discharge\r\ndoes occur, speedy relief is sometimes obtained, and the patient suffers\r\nno more during that menstrual period. With others, the commencement of\r\nthe function is painless, but from six to twenty-four hours after, the\r\nflow is arrested and the patient then experiences acute suffering. Pain\r\nmay be felt in the back, loins, and down the thighs. Sometimes it is of\r\na lancinating, neuralgic kind, at others, it is more like colic.\r\nFrequently the distress causes lassitude, fever, general uneasiness, and\r\na sense of lethargy. There are those who suffer more or less during the\r\nentire period of the flow, while the distress of others terminates at\r\nthe time when a membranous cast is expelled. For convenience of\r\ndescription, dysmenorrhea has been divided into the following varieties:\r\n_neuralgic, congestive, inflammatory, membranous_, and _obstructive_.\r\n\r\n_The neuralgic variety_ of dysmenorrhea, sometimes called _spasmodic_ or\r\n_idiopathic_, occurs when there is excessive sensibility of the ovaries\r\nand uterine nerves, which sympathetically _respond_, especially to\r\ncutaneous, biliary, and sexual irritation, and when ovarian or uterine\r\nirritation is communicated to distant nerve-centres. In the first class,\r\nusually comprising lean persons of an encephalic temperament, whatever\r\ndisorders the functions of the general system, instantaneously reflects\r\nupon the ovaries and uterine nerves, and the menstrual function Is\r\ncorrespondingly disturbed, and, instead of being painless, the flow\r\nbecomes spasmodic, with paroxysms of distress. In the second class,\r\nwhich includes those persons who are plethoric, the ovarian and uterine\r\nnerves seem to be the origin and centre of irritation, which is\r\nsometimes so severe as to cause indescribable pain. We have known women\r\nwho affirmed that the severity of labor pains was not so great as that\r\nfrom this cause. In one instance, the subject suffered thus for eleven\r\nyears, and then became a mother, and has ever asserted that her periodic\r\nsuffering was far more intense than the pain experienced during her\r\nconfinement. These neuralgic pains fly along the tracks of nerves to\r\ndifferent organs, and capriciously dart from point to point with\r\nmarvelous celerity, producing nausea, headache, and sometimes delirium.\r\n\r\nIN THE CONGESTIVE VARIETY of dysmenorrhea, the menstrual period may be\r\nushered in without pain; after a few hours, the pulse becomes stronger\r\nand more rapid, the skin grows hot and dry, the menses stop, there is\r\nuneasiness, restlessness, and severe pelvic pains. Evidently, the mucous\r\nmembranes of the Fallopian tubes and uterus have become congested, and\r\nthe pain results from the arrest of the functional process, the\r\nexudation of blood.\r\n\r\nTHE CAUSES are plethora, exposure to cold, excitement of the emotions or\r\npassions, and a morbid condition of the blood. Sometimes congestion\r\narises in consequence of a displacement of the uterus.\r\n\r\nIN THE INFLAMMATORY VARIETY, the mucous membrane of the uterus is the\r\nseat of irritation. The blood flows into the capillary vessels in\r\ngreater abundance than is natural, and those vessels become over-dilated\r\nand enfeebled and so altered in their sensibility as to produce local\r\nexcitement and pain. It may be associated with inflammation of the\r\novaries, peritoneum, or bladder. Upon the return of the menses, there is\r\na dull, heavy, fixed pain in the pelvis, which continues until the\r\nperiod is completed. There is generally tenderness of the uterus, and\r\nalso leucorrhea during the intervals between each monthly flow.\r\n\r\nIN THE MEMBRANOUS VARIETY of dysmenorrhea, the entire mucous membrane\r\nwhich lines the cavity of the uterus, in consequence of some morbid\r\nprocess, is gradually detached and expelled at the menstrual period.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS. There are steady pains at the commencement of the menstrual\r\nflow, and they increase in violence and become decidedly expulsive. The\r\nmouth of the uterus gradually dilates, and finally, the membrane is\r\nforced out of the uterus, attended with a slight flow of blood and an\r\nentire subsidence of the pain.\r\n\r\nTHE TREATMENT, in all the preceding varieties of dysmenorrhea, should\r\nconsist of measures to determine the circulation of the blood to the\r\nsurface, and increase the perspiratory functions. Congestion and\r\ninflammation of the internal organs are generally induced by exposure to\r\ncold or from insufficient clothing. Sometimes they follow from neglect\r\nof the skin, which is not kept clean and its excretory function\r\nencouraged by warm clothing. The domestic treatment at the monthly\r\ncrisis should be commenced by the administration of hot foot, and\r\nsitz-baths, after which the patient should be warmly covered in bed, and\r\nbottles of hot water applied to the extremities, back, and thighs. Dr.\r\nPierce's Compound Extract of Smart-weed should be given in full doses,\r\nfrequently repeated, to secure its diaphoretic, emmenagogue, and anodyne\r\neffects, which, for this painful affection, is unsurpassed. For the\r\nradical cure of this disease, whether of a congestive, inflammatory, or\r\nneuralgic character, Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription, which is sold\r\nby druggists, is a pleasant and specific remedy, which will most\r\nspeedily correct the abnormal condition that produces the trouble, and\r\nthereby obviate the necessity of passing this terrible ordeal at every\r\nmonthly period. The patient should take two teaspoonfuls of the medicine\r\nthree times a day, and keep up its use in these doses for weeks.\r\nFrequently, one month will suffice to cure, but in most cases, a longer\r\nseason is required. In the end, the suffering patient will not be\r\ndisappointed, but will become a new being, ready for the enjoyment and\r\nduties of life. The bowels should be kept regular throughout the\r\ntreatment by the use of Dr. Pierce's Pleasant Pellets, if necessary. A\r\nhand or sponge-bath should be used daily to keep the skin active, and be\r\nfollowed by a brisk rubbing of the surface with a rough towel or\r\nflesh-brush. A wet sheet pack will cleanse the pores of the skin and\r\ninvite the blood into the minute capillaries of the surface, and thus\r\nprove of great benefit. It should be repeated after an interval of seven\r\ndays, but ought to be omitted if near the approach of a menstrual\r\nperiod. The clothing should be warm, to protect the system against\r\nchanges of temperature; especially should every precaution be taken to\r\nkeep the feet dry and warm. The patient should walk in the open air, and\r\nthe distance should be regularly lengthened at each succeeding walk. If\r\nthe course of treatment which we have suggested be faithfully pursued, a\r\npermanent cure will be effected.\r\n\r\nIN THE OBSTRUCTIVE VARIETY of dysmenorrhea, some organic impediment\r\nhinders the exit of the menstrual blood from the uterus, which,\r\nconsequently, becomes distended and painful. The pain may be constant,\r\nbut is most acute when the uterus makes spasmodic efforts to discharge\r\nthe menstrual blood. If these efforts prove successful, there is an\r\ninterval of relief. Flexion or version of the womb may produce partial\r\nocclusion of the canal of the neck of the uterus, thus preventing the\r\nfree flow of the menstrual fluid through it. Tumors located in the body\r\nor neck of the uterus often cause obstruction to the free discharge of\r\nthe menses. Imperforate hymen and vaginal stricture also sometimes cause\r\nobstruction and give rise to painful menstruation. As these several\r\nabnormal conditions and diseases will be treated of elsewhere in this\r\nvolume, we omit their further consideration here.\r\n\r\nPartial adhesion of the walls of the neck of the womb may result from\r\ninflammation of the mucous lining, and prevent a free and easy exit of\r\nthe menstrual fluid. In many cases, the contracted and narrowed\r\ncondition of the canal of the cervix seems to be a congenital deformity,\r\nfor we can trace it to no perceptible cause. It is also true that\r\ncontraction and partial, or even complete, stricture of the cervix, or\r\nneck of the womb, often results from the improper application of strong\r\ncaustics to this passage by incompetent and ignorant surgeons. Every\r\nperson has observed the contraction of tissue caused by a severe burn,\r\nwhich often produces such a distortion of the injured part as to\r\ndisfigure the body for life. A similar result is produced when the neck\r\nof the womb is burned with strong caustics. The tissues are destroyed,\r\nand, as the parts heal, the deeper-seated tissues firmly contract,\r\nforming a hard, unyielding cicatrix, thus constricting the neck of the\r\nwomb, through which the menses pass into the vagina.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.\r\n\r\nTHE UTERINE DILATOR.\r\n\r\nThis instrument is\r\nintroduced into the\r\ncanal of the uterine\r\nneck with its blades\r\nclosed. By means\r\nof the thumb-screw\r\nthe blades are then\r\nseparated as shown\r\nin this illustration,\r\nthe cervical canal\r\nbeing thereby dilated\r\nto the required\r\nextent.]\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. From the nature of this malady, it will readily be seen that\r\nno medical treatment can effect a radical cure. We must therefore resort\r\nto surgery. In a small proportion of cases, the stricture may be cured\r\nby repeated dilations of the constricted part of the cervical canal.\r\nThis may be accomplished by using a very smooth probe which is fine at\r\nthe point, but increases in size, so that its introduction will widen\r\nand expand the orifice and canal. The stricture may be overcome in many\r\ncases by using different sized probes. In some instances, we have\r\nemployed the uterine dilator, represented by Fig. 3. We have also\r\nintroduced sea-tangle and sponge tents into the neck of the womb, and\r\nallowed them to remain until they expanded by absorbing moisture from\r\nthe surrounding tissues. The latter process is simple, and in many cases\r\npreferable. By means of a speculum (see Figs. 15 and 16), the mouth of\r\nthe womb is brought into view, and the surgeon seizes a small tent with\r\na pair of forceps and gently presses it into the neck of the womb, where\r\nit is left to expand and thus dilate the passage. If there seems to be a\r\npersistent disposition of the circular fibers of the cervix to contract,\r\nand thus close the canal, a surgical operation will be necessary to\r\ninsure permanent relief. In performing this operation, we use a cutting\r\ninstrument called the hysterotome (see Figs. 4 and 5). By the use of\r\nthis instrument, the cervical canal is enlarged by an incision on either\r\nside. The operation is but slightly painful, and, in the hands of a\r\ncompetent surgeon, is perfectly safe. We have operated in a very large\r\nnumber of cases and have never known any alarming or dangerous symptoms\r\nto result. After the incision, a small roll of cotton, thoroughly\r\nsaturated with glycerine, is applied to the incised parts, and a larger\r\nroll is introduced into the vagina. The second day after the operation,\r\nthe cotton is removed, the edges of the wound separated by a uterine\r\nsound or probe, and a cotton tent introduced into the cervix, and\r\nallowed to remain, so that it will expand and thus open the wound to its\r\nfull extent. This treatment must be thoroughly applied, and repeated\r\nevery alternate day, until the incised parts are perfectly healed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.\r\nWHITE'S HYSTEROTOME.\r\n\r\nIn operating, this instrument is introduced into the canal of the neck of the\r\nwomb, when a thumb screw in the end of the handle is turned, by which a small\r\nblade is thrown out from each side, and as the instrument is withdrawn from the\r\ncanal an incision is made on each side, thus enlarging the passage. The upper\r\nfigure illustrates the instrument closed, ready for introduction; the lower one,\r\nwith the blades projected for cutting.]\r\n\r\nMany times patients cannot understand why it is that the operation of\r\ncutting the constricted cervix causes no pain; they often being entirely\r\nunconscious of the making of the incision. The explanation is easy. The\r\ncervix uteri, or neck of the womb, is supplied with but few nerves of\r\nsensation, and is almost as destitute of sensation as the finger or toe\r\nnails, the paring of which causes not the slightest pain. On this\r\naccount we never find it necessary to administer chloroform or any other\r\nanæsthetic when undertaking this operation. If the patient be extremely\r\nsensitive the application to the cervix of a weak solution of cocaine is\r\nquite sufficient to completely benumb or anesthetize the parts so as to\r\nentirely avoid all pain from the operation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.\r\n\r\nSTOHLMAN'S HYSTEROTOME.\r\n\r\nThis instrument has two cutting blades which shut past each other, as\r\nseen in the lower figure, so as not to cut when introduced into the\r\ncanal of the uterine neck. After introduction, the cutting blades are\r\nseparated, as shown in the upper figure, the extent of the incision\r\nbeing regulated by the thumb-screw attached to the handles, as\r\nrepresented in the lower figure.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMENORRHAGIA.\r\n\r\n(PROFUSE MENSTRUATION.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe word _Menorrhagia_, which is of Greek derivation, literally means\r\n_monthly breaking away_, and is employed to designate profuse\r\nmenstruation. This disorder must not be confounded with those\r\nhemorrhages which are not periodical, and which are due to other causes.\r\nThe term _menhorrhagia_ is restricted to an immoderate monthly flow. The\r\nmenstrual flow may occur too often, continue too long, or be too\r\nprofuse. It induces a feeble pulse, cold extremities, weak respiration,\r\ngeneral debility, and may occur in opposite states of the system,\r\n_i.e._, in women who have a plethoric and robust habit, or in those of\r\nflaccid muscles and bloodless features. When the menstrual discharge is\r\nnatural, it is so gradual that by mixing with the vaginal secretions it\r\nis prevented from coagulating, while in this disease, clots are often\r\nformed.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS. In women of a _plethoric_ habit, it is ushered in by itching\r\nand heat in the vagina, pain and a feeling of weight in the loins and\r\nlower part of the abdomen, and, at times, the breasts become hot and\r\npainful. There is considerable thirst, headache, and giddiness. At last,\r\nthe blood appears and flows profusely, and all the violent symptoms at\r\nonce subside. The rest of the period is marked by an inordinate flow,\r\nleaving the system weak from the loss of blood. It oftener occurs,\r\nhowever, in persons who are naturally weak and delicate, in which case\r\nthe periods are more frequent and continue longer, and after a time they\r\nare renewed by any bodily exertion or mental emotion, so that a constant\r\ndrain exists. If the flow of blood is not continuous, leucorrhea\r\nintervenes. The patient gradually loses strength and becomes languid,\r\nher face is pale and usually bloated, livid circles appear around the\r\neyes, the appetite is impaired, the bowels are constipated, and the feet\r\nand ankles swollen. Lack of blood in the brain is indicated by headache,\r\nringing in the ears, and dizziness. The patient is nervous and\r\nirritable, being disturbed by the slightest noise, and the heart\r\npalpitates after the least exertion.\r\n\r\nCAUSES. The _first_ form is caused by eating too much rich and\r\nhighly-seasoned food, drinking wine, porter, ale, or beer, want of\r\nexercise, in brief, whatever induces plethora; the _second_ results from\r\nan insufficient or poor diet, leucorrhea, frequent abortions, want of\r\nventilation, inherent feebleness, and whatever depresses the vital\r\npowers. Either form may be due to syphilitic taints, excessive sexual\r\nindulgence, accidents of pregnancy, or organic diseases of the womb. The\r\nmorbid affections of the womb most likely to induce menorrhagia, are\r\ngranular ulceration of its mouth and neck, fungous degeneration of its\r\nlining membrane, and tumors within that organ. As these subjects will be\r\nseverally considered hereafter, we shall here dismiss them with this\r\nbrief notice.\r\n\r\nProfuse menstruation is very prone to occur in young women of a\r\nlymphatic temperament, whose organs are sleazy in texture.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. To control the excessive flow, the patient should remain in\r\nher bed, and assume the recumbent position until the period is passed.\r\nIf circumstances prevent strict compliance with this rule, it should be\r\nobserved as nearly as possible. Warmth should be applied to the feet,\r\nand cold cloths, which ought to be removed as soon as they become warm\r\nby the heat of the body, should be repeatedly placed upon the back and\r\nabdomen. A strong tea made from cinnamon bark, or witch-hazel leaves or\r\nbark, taken freely, will prove very efficacious in checking the flow.\r\nThe fluid extract of ergot, in doses of from half a teaspoonful to a\r\nteaspoonful, in a little water or cinnamon tea, is one of the most\r\neffectual remedies in this affection. Another valuable remedy for\r\narresting menorrhagia is an infusion of Canada fleabane; or the oil of\r\nthis plant may be administered in doses of from five to ten drops on\r\nsugar. Gallic acid is also a good styptic to employ in these cases. If\r\nthere is febrile excitement, a hard pulse, frequent and throbbing, and\r\nif there is headache, thirst, parched lips, hot and dry skin, as is\r\nsometimes the case, then menorrhagia is due to an augmented action of\r\nthe heart and arteries, and the indication of treatment is to diminish\r\nvascular action. This may be temporarily accomplished by the use of\r\nveratrum viride, which should be continued until the flow is\r\nsufficiently diminished.\r\n\r\nThe means already suggested will generally prove effective in\r\ncontrolling the inordinate flow at the time. Treatment that will produce\r\npermanent relief should then be adopted. The condition of the skin,\r\nkidneys, and bowels, requires attention for noxious elements should not\r\nbe retained in the system. To give tone to weakened pelvic organs we\r\nknow of nothing more specific in its effects than Dr. Pierce's Favorite\r\nPrescription, which is sold by druggists. It should be taken\r\ncontinuously for weeks, in order to fully correct the extremely weakened\r\ncondition of that organ. It also aids nutrition, and thus tones up the\r\ngeneral system, so that in the form of profuse menstruation, resulting\r\nfrom debility, the patient is strengthened, her blood enriched, and her\r\nnervousness quieted, which constitutes the necessary treatment to make\r\nthe cure permanent.\r\n\r\nAs women approach the critical age, and menstruation ceases, if they are\r\nanæmic, their condition is pitiable. This period is popularly\r\ndenominated the _turn of life_. Under favorable circumstances, the\r\nvitality is decidedly enhanced, and the decline of this function is\r\nattended with a revival of the bodily powers. But when this crisis has\r\nbeen preceded by excessive labor, when intemperance or excesses of any\r\nkind have deranged the bodily functions and perverted nutrition, when\r\nthe mind has been long and deeply depressed, or when the insidious\r\nprogress of disease of the heart, liver, or other Important organs,\r\noccurs in consequence of irregularities of living, then there is danger\r\nof congestion of the uterus and a protracted and profuse menstrual flow,\r\nwhich favors a decline.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of this form of menorrhagia does not differ from that\r\nalready suggested. The diet should be light and nourishing, and daily\r\nexercise, such as walking, riding, change of air and scenery, all will\r\ncontribute to restoration. Especial attention should be directed to the\r\ncondition of the bowels and liver. If the latter be deranged, Dr.\r\nPierce's Golden Medical Discovery will be a most efficacious remedy.\r\nWhen there is a diminution of vital force, resulting in impaired\r\nnutrition and disorders of blood, an alterative is required which will\r\ninsensibly and gradually restore activity by removing the causes of\r\nderangement. Impairment of nutrition is very frequently associated with\r\nfunctional or organic disease of the liver, and curative measures\r\nconsist of the use of alteratives, friction baths, exercise, nutritive\r\ndiet, and diversion of the mind. Whenever innutrition depends upon\r\ndeprivation of the blood or torpor of any of the secretory organs, the\r\n\"Golden Medical Discovery\" will prove to be an invaluable remedial\r\nagent, for it is an alterative and at the same time a blood restorative.\r\nIf the bowels be costive small laxative doses of Dr. Pierce's Pleasant\r\nPellets should be employed. The \"Favorite Prescription\" regulates the\r\nmenstrual function by toning up the tissues of the uterus and\r\nrestraining the escape of the menses from the orifices of the\r\nblood-vessels. While the diet should be nourishing, consisting of wild\r\ngame, mutton, chicken, and wine, the patient ought not to debilitate the\r\nstomach by the use of strong tea or coffee. The circulation of the blood\r\nshould be quickened by riding, walking, exposure to sunlight, and fresh\r\nair. The patient ought to engage in some light occupation, in which the\r\nmind will be constantly as well as agreeably employed, but not\r\novertaxed. By pursuing the course of treatment, invalids suffering from\r\nmenorrhagia may be permanently restored to health.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TURN OF LIFE.\r\n\r\n(CESSATION OF THE MENSES.)\r\n\r\n\r\nMenstruation commonly occurs at regular monthly intervals, during a\r\nperiod of about thirty years. The time for its cessation depends\r\nsomewhat upon the date of its first appearance. In the temperate zones\r\nit commences at about the fifteenth year, and, consequently should\r\nterminate at the forty-fifth year. Instances are common, however, in\r\nwhich it has been prolonged until the fiftieth and even to the\r\nfifty-fifth year. In warm climates it commences and terminates at an\r\nearlier age.\r\n\r\nAs women approach the critical period of life, if the general health and\r\nhabits be good, the discharge may gradually diminish, and, at length,\r\ntotally disappear, without producing any particular inconvenience, but\r\nthis seldom happens. More frequently, the discharge is entirely absent\r\nfor six or seven weeks, and when it does return, it is more copious than\r\nusual. In some cases, the flow is not only too profuse, but too\r\nfrequent. Many months may elapse before the menses return, and, even\r\nthen, they are apt to be very pale and deficient in quantity.\r\n\r\nThe fluctuations of this function occasion irregularities and\r\ndisturbances of the general health. When the flow of blood is diverted\r\nfrom the uterus, it is liable to be directed to the head or some other\r\npart of the body. In fact, there appears to be constitutional agitation,\r\nand disorders of all the organs. Perhaps one reason for calling this a\r\ncritical period is, that if there is a morbid tendency in the system, a\r\ndisposition to develop tumors of the breast or uterus, these are very\r\nliable to make rapid progress at this time, since they are not relieved\r\nby the customary, local exudation of blood. It is a time favorable to\r\nthe awakening of latent disorder and morbid growths, for, at the decline\r\nof the menstrual function, the uterus is not so capable of resisting\r\nvitiating influences.\r\n\r\nThere is greater liability to irritation of the bladder and rectum, and\r\nthe menstrual flow may be superseded by a white, acrid discharge, caused\r\nby an inflammation of the mucous membrane of the vagina. Even if the\r\nsystem be not enfeebled by excessive losses of blood, debility may\r\nresult from a continued irritation of the uterine organs, and cause the\r\nmorbid discharge. The nervous system sympathetically responds, becoming\r\nexceedingly irritable, and thus implicating in this derangement every\r\nbodily organ. In some constitutions, the change of any habit is almost\r\nimpossible, particularly if it is improperly acquired, or detrimental to\r\nhealth; and so we have sometimes thought respecting this function, that\r\nthe more it has been abused and perverted during the time of Its natural\r\nactivity, the greater is the disturbance occasioned when it ceases.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. There should be regularity in all the habits of life. Women\r\nare too apt to approach this important period without due care and\r\nconsideration. When the physical system is about to suspend a function,\r\nit is folly to endeavor to perform the labor or assume the\r\nresponsibilities which were permissible when the constitution was more\r\nrobust.\r\n\r\nHow the duties of each day and hour weigh upon the energies of the\r\nmother! What intense solicitude and yearning she experiences! How\r\nunselfish is that mother who each day works steadily and faithfully for\r\nothers, and who is conscious of the hidden dangers that lurk around her\r\npathway! With confiding faith and love, she commends the interests of\r\nher children to Him who doeth all things well. She anticipates the wants\r\nof her family and strives to supply the desired comforts, thus wasting\r\nher strength in the labors prompted by her loving nature. Would it not\r\nbe a greater comfort to those children to have the counsel of their dear\r\nmother in later years, than to have the bitter reflection that she\r\nsacrificed her health and life for their gratification?\r\n\r\nUnconsciously, perhaps, but none the less certainly, do women enter upon\r\nthis period regardless of the care they ought to bestow upon themselves.\r\nWithout sufficient forethought or an understanding of the functional\r\nchanges taking place, they over-tax their strength, until, by continuous\r\nexertion, they break down under those labors which, to persons of their\r\nage, are excessive and injurious. Is it strange, when woman has thus\r\nexhausted her energies, when her body trembles with fatigue and her mind\r\nis agitated with responsibilities, that the menses capriciously return,\r\nor the uterus is unable to withstand congestion, and capillary\r\nhemorrhage becomes excessive? If the physical system had not been thus\r\nexhausted, it would have exercised its powers for the conservation of\r\nhealth and strength. It is better to be forewarned of the ills to which\r\nwe are liable, and fortify ourselves against them, rather than squander\r\nthe strength intended for personal preservation. Let every woman, and\r\nespecially every _mother_, consider her situation and properly prepare\r\nfor that grand climacteric, which so materially influences her future\r\nhealth and life.\r\n\r\nThe general health should be carefully preserved by those exercises\r\nwhich will equalize the circulation of the blood, and the regular action\r\nof the bowels should be promoted by the use of those articles of diet\r\nwhich contribute to this end. Relieve the mind of responsibility, keep\r\nthe skin clean, and enrich the blood with tonics and alteratives. For\r\nthe latter purpose, use Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription and \"Golden\r\nMedical Discovery.\" If these remedies fail, seek professional advice. A\r\ncareful regulation of the habits, strict attention to the requirements\r\nof the system, and the use of tonic medicines, will very frequently\r\nrender the employment of a physician unnecessary\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLEUCORRHEA.\r\n\r\n(\"WHITES.\")\r\n\r\n\r\nLeucorrhea is the symptomatic manifestation of some uterine or vaginal\r\naffection, vulgarly called \"whites.\" We say _symptomatic_, for the white\r\nor yellowish discharge, which we term leucorrhea, is not a disease, but\r\na symptom of some uterine or vaginal disorder. We call it a _white_\r\ndischarge to distinguish it from the menses and uterine hemorrhages. It\r\nvaries, however, in color and consistency from a white, glairy mucus to\r\na yellow or greenish, purulent, fetid matter. Sometimes it has a curdled\r\nappearance, at others, it is of the consistency of cream. Leucorrhea is\r\nthe most common symptom of uterine derangement, and there are few\r\nfemales who are not affected by it at some period of life. It may\r\noriginate either in the vagina or uterus, and it is accordingly termed\r\neither vaginal or uterine leucorrhea. The nature of leucorrhea is\r\nanalogous to that of nasal catarrh. In a healthy state, the lining\r\nmembrane of the genital organs secretes sufficient mucus to moisten\r\nthem; but, if the mucous membrane is temporarily congested or inflamed,\r\nthe secretion becomes profuse, irritating, and offensive. Vaginal and\r\nuterine leucorrhea are essentially different in character, the former\r\nbeing an acid, and the latter an alkaline secretion, and, while the\r\nfirst is a creamy, purulent fluid, the latter is thick and ropy, like\r\nthe white of an egg. In fact, the latter discharge is rich in albuminous\r\nmatter and blood-corpuscles, hence, its great debilitating effect upon\r\nthe system, and, if not promptly arrested it is likely to produce\r\n_vaginitis, pruritus vulvce_, or _vulvitis_.\r\n\r\nVAGINITIS is indicated by intense inflammation of the mucous membrane of\r\nthe vagina. When this affection is present the patient experiences a\r\nsense of burning heat, aching and weight in the region of the vagina,\r\nviolent and throbbing pains in the pelvis, and the discharge is profuse\r\nand very offensive. There is also a frequent desire to urinate, and the\r\npassage of the urine causes a sensation of scalding.\r\n\r\nPRURITUS VULVAE. The discharge irritates the nerves of the external\r\ngenital parts, thus producing an almost unendurable itching. Scratching\r\nor rubbing the parts only aggravates the affection. The patient is\r\ntormented night and day, is deprived of sleep, and naturally becomes\r\ndespondent. Pruritus vulvae, in its severest forms, is often developed\r\nwhen the discharge is scarcely noticeable. It is the most common result\r\nor accompaniment of leucorrhea.\r\n\r\nVULVITIS. This term indicates an inflammation of the lining membrane of\r\nthe external genital parts. Sometimes the inflammation extends to the\r\ndeeper tissues, causing great pain, and even suppuration, resulting in\r\nthe formation of an abscess. The attack is indicated by redness,\r\nswelling, and a feverish state of the affected parts, which is quickly\r\nfollowed by a profuse flow of yellow pus, and, in some instances, small\r\nulcers are formed on the affected parts.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS. The sufferer from leucorrhea becomes pale and emaciated, the\r\neyes dull and heavy, the functions of the skin, stomach and bowels\r\nbecome deranged, more or less pain in the head is experienced, sometimes\r\naccompanied with dizziness, palpitation is common, and, as the disease\r\nprogresses, the blood becomes impoverished, the feet and ankles are\r\nswollen, the mind is apprehensive and melancholy, and very frequently\r\nthe function of generation is injured, resulting in complete sterility.\r\nExercise produces pain in the small of the back and the lower portion of\r\nthe spine, and, owing to a relation of the vaginal walls, the womb falls\r\nfar below its natural position, or turns in various directions,\r\naccording to the manner in which the weight above rests upon it. Ulcers\r\nare apt to appear upon the mouth of the womb, the matter from which\r\ntinges the discharge and stains the linen. Hysteria is often an\r\nattendant of this disease.\r\n\r\nCAUSES. The immediate cause of leucorrhea is either congestion, or\r\ninflammation of the mucous membrane of the vagina or womb, or both. The\r\nexciting causes are numerous. Among others, deranged menstruation,\r\nprolonged nursing of children, pregnancy, abortions, excessive\r\nindulgence in sexual intercourse, uncleanliness, piles, uterine ulcers,\r\nand displacement of the womb, are the most common. In brief, it usually\r\naccompanies every uterine disorder which vitiates and reduces the\r\nsystem. During childhood, particularly in scrofulous children,\r\ndischarges from the vagina are not unfrequent, owing to worms or other\r\nintestinal irritation.\r\n\r\nAmong the organic causes of leucorrhea, are ulceration of the mouth or\r\nneck of the womb and tumors. These will be considered hereafter.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. We have dwelt upon leucorrhea because of its prevalence and\r\nin order to exhibit the various forms it may assume. These reasons long\r\nago prompted us to investigate it; and, ascertaining the derangement to\r\nconsist in a relaxation of the walls of the vagina, attendant upon\r\ndepressed vitality, for many years we experimented with various\r\nmedicines to find those that would exercise specific properties in\r\nrestoring the tissues involved to a natural condition, thereby arresting\r\nthe abnormal discharge. Our efforts in that direction have been very\r\nsuccessful, and our expectations more than realized. The treatment which\r\nwe shall recommend is rational, based upon the pathological conditions\r\nof the disease, and has been attended with the greatest success.\r\n\r\nIt embraces the use of those general restoratives and specific uterine\r\ntonics, so harmoniously combined in Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription,\r\na remedy which has achieved unparalleled success in the cure of this\r\naffection and won the highest praise from thousands of grateful women.\r\nIt many cases, it is well to accompany its use with alterative\r\ntreatment, for which the \"Golden Medical Discovery\" will be found\r\nespecially effective. It is an absurd practice to arrest the discharge\r\nwith astringent injections _alone_. The weak and lax walls of the\r\nvagina, as well as the other tissues of the system, require strength,\r\nand this can be gained only by the use of general and special tonics.\r\nAppropriate injections as _auxiliary_ treatment will very much _assist_\r\nin the cure. The \"Favorite Prescription\" is a special tonic for the\r\naffected parts, and the \"Golden Medical Discovery\" is the best general\r\nalterative of which we have any knowledge. They may be taken in\r\nalternate doses every day. If the patient is very pale and anæmic, one\r\ndrachm of the carbonate, or two drachms of the citrate or pyrophosphate\r\nof iron, may be advantageously added to each bottle of the \"Favorite\r\nPrescription.\" If the carbonate be employed, as it is insoluble, the\r\nbottle should be well shaken every time before using. The functions of\r\nthe skin should be kept active by frequent baths, and the patient, if\r\nable, should walk or ride in the open air, and freely expose herself to\r\nthe sunshine. If the invalid be too weak to exercise much, she should go\r\nout in warm weather and sit in the open air. Sunshine is no less\r\nimportant in maintaining animal, than in supporting vegetable growth and\r\nhealth. The human being, like the plant, sickens and grows pale, weak\r\nand tender, if secluded from the sunlight. The apartments occupied\r\nshould be thoroughly ventilated. Many women are sickly and feeble\r\nbecause they live in badly ventilated rooms.\r\n\r\nWe cannot too strongly urge in this, as in all other chronic diseases\r\npeculiar to women, that the bowels be kept regular. Frequent, but small\r\ndoses of Dr. Pierce's Pleasant Pellets will prove most beneficial. If\r\nthe vaginal passage is tender and irritable, an infusion, or tea of\r\nslippery-elm bark is very soothing, and may be used freely with a\r\nvaginal syringe. Whatever injection is employed, should be preceded by\r\nthe free use of Castile soap and warm water, to thoroughly cleanse the\r\nparts. One part of glycerine to six parts of water is a soothing lotion\r\nwhen there is much tenderness, heat, and pain in the vagina. If there be\r\nno great tenderness in the vagina, or if the acute, inflammatory\r\nsymptoms have yielded to the lotions already suggested, then a tonic and\r\nastringent injection should be employed.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose a wash made by dissolving one of DR. PIERCE'S PURIFYING\r\nAND STRENGTHENING LOTION TABLETS, in one pint of hot water is a superior\r\napplication and will not fail to be of great benefit in controlling the\r\ndisagreeable drain. If your medicine dealer is not supplied with these,\r\nmail 25 cents in one-cent stamps to us and we will forward a box of the\r\nLotion Tablets by return post.\r\n\r\nThese Lotion Tablets have for many years been used in the treatment of\r\nobstinate cases of leucorrhea at the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical\r\nInstitute, and their efficiency has been alike gratifying to both\r\npatient and physician.\r\n\r\nIf _pruritus_ or severe itching, be also a symptom, the itching will\r\nreadily yield if the parts be cleansed with Castile or other fine soap\r\nand warm water, followed by the application of a compound composed of\r\ntwo ounces of glycerine, one ounce of rose-water, and one drachm of\r\nsulphite of soda; or, for the sulphite of soda, two drachms of borax may\r\nbe substituted. The following lotion is a good one to relieve pruritus:\r\nsugar of lead, two drachms; carbolic acid, half a drachm; laudanum, four\r\nounces; glycerine, four ounces; water, four pints; mix. This may be\r\napplied to the itching parts, and also injected into the vagina.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.\r\nFOUNTAIN SYRINGE.]\r\n\r\nHOW TO USE VAGINAL INJECTIONS. We usually recommend the Fountain Syringe\r\nillustrated in Fig. 6, as the most convenient instrument for\r\nadministering vaginal injections. The fountains supplied by us are of\r\nsoft rubber, and have extra nozzles, with which to make rectal, nasal or\r\near irrigations. There is also a large, long nozzle for vaginal\r\ninjections.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.\r\nSOFT RUBBER-BULB SYRINGE]\r\n\r\nIt is channeled so is to permit the free clearing away of the secretions\r\nas the Douche is employed. The Fountain Syringe can he used without\r\nassistance, the flow of fluid is gradual, and with a force that can be\r\nvaried, by raising or lowering the reservoir, yet is never so great as\r\nto be liable to produce injurious effects.\r\n\r\nThe syringes usually sold with small nozzles or pipes are of little or\r\nno value for vaginal injections. In many instances so small a tube will\r\npass readily into the canal of the uterus, and hence there has\r\nfrequently resulted an injection of a portion of the fluid into the\r\nuterus itself, producing severe pain. It is important, therefore, in\r\nusing the Vaginal Douche to employ only a large tube that has grooves in\r\nits surface for the free clearing away of the fluid as it runs from the\r\nfountain.\r\n\r\nWhere it is desired to obtain relief from a congested, inflamed or\r\nsensitive and irritable state of the mucous surface, the employment of a\r\nlarge quantity of water as hot as it can be borne, is of the greatest\r\nremedial value. It rapidly diminishes the size of the blood vessels, and\r\naids in bringing about a normal circulation in the parts.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, in taking the Douche with the Fountain Syringe the rubber bag\r\nis filled, and suspended from a nail or hook at a height of from two to\r\nfive feet above the patient, and the fluid passes through the tube by\r\nforce of gravity, thus requiring no muscular exercise. The force of the\r\nstream depends upon the height of the fountain above the outlet nozzle.\r\nIt is only necessary that the patient should assume a comfortable\r\nposition where the fluid which comes from the vaginal canal can flow\r\ninto a water closet, or any convenient vessel.\r\n\r\nAfter a thorough cleansing of the vaginal surfaces of mucus, by means of\r\nthe warm or hot water, it is sometimes advisable to inject remedial\r\nfluids. These injections may readily be made with the fountain or bulb\r\nsyringe, introducing not less than from two to four ounces. This may be\r\nretained sufficiently long to exert its remedial effects upon the mucous\r\nsurface, which usually takes from five to eight minutes. The hips should\r\nbe elevated, and the nozzle of the syringe surrounded by a napkin or\r\nother similar material, upon which moderate compression can be made so\r\nas to retain the fluid in the vagina for the necessary period.\r\n\r\nWhen suffering from any uterine trouble, it is necessary to avoid severe\r\nfatigue. The amount and character of exercise should be suited to the\r\ncondition of the patient; while, most important of all, the strictest\r\nabstinence from sexual intercourse should be observed.\r\n\r\nTo those who are unable readily to obtain the Fountain Syringe above\r\nrecommended we can send by mail, post-paid, one of these instruments on\r\nreceipt of $2.00.\r\n\r\nA Soft Rubber-bulb, or Pump Syringe (illustrated in Fig. 7), not so good\r\nfor making vaginal injections, can be sent by us, post-paid, for from\r\n75cts. to $1.50, the price varying with the quality and size.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTERILITY.\r\n\r\n(BARRENNESS.)\r\n\r\n\r\nReal sentiment and interest center in fecundity, since the desires and\r\nhappiness of mankind are consummated in marriage and procreation. How\r\ndreary would life be without love, companionship, and the family! How\r\nprecious are the ties that bind our hearts to father, mother, daughter,\r\nand son! The love of children is innate in the heart of every true man\r\nand woman. Each child born supplements the lives of its parents with new\r\ninterest, awakens tender concern, and unites their sympathies with its\r\nyoung life.\r\n\r\nHow dreary is the thought that one may attain a ripe old age with\r\nneither son nor daughter to smooth the decline of life, or sorrow for\r\nhis or her departure! How many women desire a _first-born_ of love, the\r\nidol of their waiting hearts, a soul, which shall be begotten within,\r\nclothed with their own nature, and yet immortal! It is a natural\r\ninstinct, this yearning of the heart for offspring; and yet little is\r\nsaid upon this subject, in which so much is experienced. All that is\r\nbeautiful and lovely in woman, finds its climax in motherhood. What\r\nearthly being do we love so devotedly as our mother?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.]\r\n\r\nMen and women exhibit but little concern, mere idle curiosity, perhaps,\r\non this subject, unless, perchance, there is no evidence of their own\r\nreproductive powers. If, however, these appear to be deficient, then few\r\ntopics are more deeply interesting or investigated with greater personal\r\nsolicitude. Such persons will seldom submit their condition to the\r\nfamily physician, for it is a delicate subject, involving personal\r\nconsiderations, and, therefor, they prefer to consult with one who\r\ncannot connect their unfortunate situation with any of the incidents\r\nwhich enter into the history of their lives. This is very natural, and\r\nsometimes is the only way to keep private matters profoundly secret.\r\nBeing widely known as specialists, devoting our undivided attention to\r\nchronic affections, and having unusual facilities for the investigation\r\nand management of such cases, we have been applied to in innumerable\r\ninstances, to ascertain the causes of barrenness and effect its removal.\r\n\r\nIt is admitted that the question of a woman's sterility is practically\r\ndecided in the first three years of married life, for statistics show\r\nthat less than ten out of a hundred women who do not indicate their\r\nfertility in the first three years of wedlock ever bear children. We\r\nhave treated many who gave no evidence of fertility for a much longer\r\nperiod of married life, and who afterwards gave birth to children. We\r\nare unable to state the proper ratio of the number of the married who\r\nare childless; much less have we the right to assume that all who\r\ndecline the responsibilities of motherhood are necessarily barren.\r\n\r\nCAUSES. The causes of barrenness may be obliteration of the canal of the\r\nneck of the womb, sealing up of its mouth, or inflammation resulting in\r\nadhesion of the walls of the vagina, thus obstructing the passage to the\r\nuterus. In the latter case, the vagina forms a short, closed sac. In\r\nsome instances, the vaginal passage cannot be entered in consequence of\r\nan imperforate hymen. Again, the cause of barrenness may either be a\r\ndiseased condition of the ovaries, preventing them from maturing healthy\r\ngerms, or chronic inflammation of the mucous membrane of the neck of the\r\nuterus, which does not render conception impossible, but improbable. It\r\nis one of the most common causes of unfruitfulness, because the female\r\nseldom, if ever, recovers from it spontaneously. It has been known to\r\nexist for twenty or thirty years.\r\n\r\nChronic inflammation of the vagina also gives rise to acrid secretions,\r\nwhich destroy the vitality of the spermatozoa. Suppression of the\r\nmenses, or any disorder of the uterine functions, may disqualify the\r\nfemale for reproduction. Flexions of the uterus, displacements,\r\ncongestions, and local debility, may likewise prevent fertility.\r\nSterility may result from impaired ovarian innervation or undue\r\nexcitement of the nerves, either of which deranges the process of\r\novulation. Even too frequent indulgence in marital pleasures sometimes\r\ndefeats conception. Prostitutes who indulge in excessive and promiscuous\r\nsexual intercourse, seldom become pregnant. Any thing that enfeebles the\r\nfunctional powers of the system is liable to disqualify the female for\r\nreproduction.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. An extensive observation and experience in the treatment of\r\nsterility, convinces us that, in the majority of cases, barrenness is\r\ndue to some form of disease which can be easily remedied. If the\r\npassages through the neck of the uterus be closed or contracted, and\r\nthis is the most frequent cause of sterility, a very delicate surgical\r\noperation, which causes little if any pain or inconvenience to the\r\npatient, will remove the impediment to fertility. In many of these\r\ncases, we have succeeded in removing the contraction and stricture of\r\nthe neck of the womb by dilatation. When the vaginal walls are so firmly\r\nunited as to prevent copulation, a surgical operation may be necessary\r\nto overcome their adhesion. When the hymen obstructs the vaginal\r\norifice, a similar operation may be necessary to divide it. Vaginismus,\r\nwhich will be treated elsewhere, sometimes causes sterility.\r\n\r\nIt is proper that we should suggest to the barren, that if sexual\r\nintercourse be indulged in only very abstemiously, conception will be\r\nmore likely to occur than if moderation be not exercised. We may also\r\nvery properly allude to the fact that there is greater aptitude to\r\nfecundation immediately before and soon after the menstrual periods than\r\nat other times. In fact, many medical men believe that it is impossible\r\nfor conception to occur from the twelfth day following menstruation up\r\nto within two or three days of the return of the menses.\r\n\r\nELONGATION OF THE NECK OF THE WOMB. An elongated condition of the neck\r\nof the womb, illustrated by Fig. 9, is frequently a cause of sterility.\r\nIf this part is elongated, slim and pointed, as shown in the\r\nillustration, it is apt to curve or bend upon itself, thus constricting\r\nthe passage through it and preventing the transit of seminal fluid into\r\nthe womb. An eminent author says, \"Even a slight degree of elongation,\r\nin which the cervix, or neck, has a conical shape, has been observed to\r\nbe frequently followed by that condition [sterility].\" Our own\r\nobservations, embracing the examination of hundreds of sterile women\r\nannually, lead us to believe that this condition is among the common\r\ncauses of barrenness. But, fortunately, it is one of those most easily\r\novercome.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.\r\nConoid Neck.]\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. If the neck is only slightly elongated, this consists in\r\ndividing the slim projecting part, by the use of the _hysterotome_, If\r\nit be a more aggravated case, a portion of the womb must be removed.\r\nThis operation is perfectly safe and simple, and, strange as it may seem\r\nto those who are not familiar with operations upon the womb, is not\r\npainful. We have never seen any bad results follow it, but have known it\r\nto be the means of rendering numerous barren women fruitful.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.\r\nFlexion, u, Uterus, B, Bladder.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.\r\nVersion, u, Uterus, B, Bladder.]\r\n\r\nFLEXIONS AND VERSIONS OF THE WOMB. Flexion of the uterus, in which it is\r\nbent upon itself, as illustrated in Fig. 10, produces a bending of the\r\ncervical canal, constricting or obliterating it, and thus preventing the\r\npassage of spermatozoa through it. Version of the uterus in which its\r\ntop, or _fundus_, falls either forward against the bladder\r\n(anteversion), as illustrated in Fig. 11, or backward against the rectum\r\n(retroversion), may close the mouth of the uterus by firmly pressing it\r\nagainst the wall of the vaginal canal, and thus prevent the passage of\r\nspermatozoa into the womb. 'The treatment of these several displacements\r\nwill be considered hereafter. We may here remark, however, that they can\r\nbe remedied by proper treatment. Our mechanical movements,\r\nmanipulations, and kneadings are invaluable aids in correcting these\r\ndisplacements.\r\n\r\nDISEASE OF THE OVARIES. Sterility may be due to disease of the ovaries.\r\nChronic inflammation of the ovaries may result from uterine disorders or\r\nperitonitis, and is commonly attended with a sense of fullness and\r\ntenderness, and pain in the ovarian region. These symptoms are more\r\napparent upon slight pressure, or during menstruation. This disease is\r\ncurable, although it may require considerable time to perfectly restore\r\nthe health. When this chronic affection is the result of other\r\nderangements, the indications are to restore health in the contiguous\r\norgans, and to relieve excessive congestion and nervous excitement in\r\nthe ovaries. The patient should be very quiet during the menstrual\r\nperiod and avoid severe exercise or fatiguing occupations, not only at\r\nthose periods, but during the intervals. All measures calculated to\r\nimprove the general health should be adopted. Use injections of warm\r\nwater, medicated with borax, soda, and glycerine, in the vagina every\r\nnight and morning. The surface of the body should be kept clean by the\r\ndaily employment of hand-baths, followed by brisk friction. The bowels,\r\nif constipated, should be regulated as suggested for constipation. The\r\nsystem should be strengthened by Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription,\r\nand, if the blood be disordered, no better alterative can be found for\r\ndomestic use than Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery. If the patient\r\ndoes not in a few months improve under this treatment, the case should\r\nbe placed under the immediate care of some physician well qualified by\r\neducation and experience to critically examine and successfully treat\r\nthis affection.\r\n\r\nCHRONIC INFLAMMATION AND ULCERATION OF THE UTERUS, A CAUSE OF STERILITY.\r\nWhen enumerating the causes of barrenness we mentioned that chronic\r\ninflammation of the mucous membrane of the mouth and neck of the womb\r\nwas the most common affection that defeats conception. Of all diseases\r\nof female organs, this is, without doubt, the most common, and, since it\r\ndoes not at first produce great inconvenience or immediately endanger\r\nlife, it does not excite the attention which its importance demands. It\r\nis overlooked, and, when the attention is directed to the existence of\r\nthis long-neglected disease it appears so trivial that it is not\r\nregarded as being the real cause of infertility in the patient.\r\n\r\nWhen this disease has existed for a long time, the very structure of the\r\nparts involved becomes changed. The glands of the cervical membrane\r\nsecrete a glairy mucus, resembling the white, or albuminous part of an\r\negg. The secretion is thick and ropy, and fills the entire mouth and\r\nneck of the uterus, thus preventing the entrance of the spermatozoa. The\r\nmucous membrane becomes thickened, the inflammation extends to the\r\ndeeper structures, and, on examination through the speculum, we find the\r\nmouth of the uterus inflamed, hardened, and enlarged, as represented in\r\nFig. 22, Colored Plate IV, or in Fig. 23 of same plate. Fig. 25, Plate\r\nIV, shows the mucous follicles just as they are found all along the neck\r\nof the womb, in a state of inflammation and enlargement, and filled with\r\na fluid resembling honey, giving rise to ulceration and a thick\r\ndischarge, as illustrated in Fig. 23, Colored Plate IV.\r\n\r\nFeebleness of the constitution, impoverishment of the blood, a\r\nscrofulous diathesis, want of exercise, uncleanliness, tight lacing,\r\ndisappointment, excessive excitement of the passions, the use of\r\npessaries for displacement of the uterus, overwork, and taking cold, all\r\npredispose the cervical membrane to chronic ulceration.\r\n\r\nThe inflammation may be so mild, and the discharge so trifling in\r\nquantity, as scarcely to attract attention. But after it obtains a\r\nfirmer hold, and, in most cases, it is aggravated by exposure or\r\nneglect, the patient experiences dragging sensations about the pelvis,\r\nand pain in back and loins, accompanied with a bearing-down sensation\r\nand numbness or pain extending to the thighs.\r\n\r\nThe discharge is thick, starch-like, and generally irritating. The\r\npatient becomes irascible, capricious, querulous, and sometimes moody\r\nand hysterical. She is easily discouraged, her appetite and digestion\r\nbecome impaired, and she grows thin and does not look or act as when in\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. In offering a few hints for the domestic management of these\r\nabnormal conditions, we would at the same time remark, that, while\r\nhealth may be regained by skillful treatment, recovery will be gradual.\r\nWe especially wish to guard the patient against entertaining too strong\r\nexpectations of a speedy recovery. Although she may employ the best\r\ntreatment known, yet from three to five months may elapse before a\r\nperfect cure can be effected. In persons of scrofulous diathesis, in\r\nwhom the recuperative forces are weakened, it is very difficult to\r\neffect a radical cure. It is equally true, however, that under domestic\r\nmanagement alone, thousands have been restored to perfect health and\r\nfruitfulness.\r\n\r\nHygienic management consists in toning the functions of the skin by\r\ndaily bathing the surface of the body, and quickening the circulation by\r\nbrisk friction. The patient should rise early in the morning, and\r\nexercise in the fresh and invigorating air. Those who sleep in warm\r\nrooms, or spend much of their time in bed, will continue to have\r\ncongestion of the uterus, and habitual discharges from this enfeebled\r\norgan. The patient should take daily walks, increasing the length of the\r\nexcursion from time to time, but not to the extent of producing fatigue.\r\nThe bowels, if constipated, should be regulated. Strengthen the system\r\nby using Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription, to each bottle of which add\r\ntwo drachms of citrate or pyrophosphate of iron. The mouth and neck of\r\nthe uterus should be thoroughly cleansed by the use of the syringe, as\r\nsuggested for the treatment of leucorrhea. The use of the solution of\r\nDr. Pierce's Purifying and Strengthening Lotion Tablets there advised\r\nwill also be beneficial, if thoroughly applied.\r\n\r\nA most valuable course of local treatment, which may be adopted by any\r\nintelligent lady without the aid of a physician, and one that will\r\nresult in the greatest benefit when there is morbid sensibility,\r\ncongestion, inflammation, or ulceration about the mouth or neck of the\r\nwomb, consists in applying to those parts a roll of medicated cotton or\r\nsoft sponge, allowing it to remain there for twelve hours at a time. A\r\npiece of fine, soft, compressible sponge, as large as a hen's egg, or a\r\nroll of cotton batting of two-thirds that size, is thoroughly saturated\r\nwith pure glycerine. Securely fasten to it a stout cord a few inches\r\nlong. The vagina and affected parts having been thoroughly cleansed with\r\nwarm water and Castile soap, as advised in the treatment of leucorrhea,\r\nthe sponge or cotton should be passed up the vagina with the finger, and\r\npressed rather firmly against the mouth and neck of the womb, which,\r\nbeing enlarged, and, consequently falling below its natural position,\r\nwill generally be low down in the vagina, and so hardened as to be\r\nunmistakably distinguished from the surrounding parts by the sense of\r\ntouch. The glycerine, having a very strong affinity for water, will\r\nabsorb large quantities of the _serum_, which has been effused into the\r\naffected tissues in consequence of their congestion and inflammation,\r\nand thus reduce the inflammation and enlargement. This is the cause of\r\nthe profuse, watery discharge which follows the application. In twelve\r\nhours after the sponge or cotton has been applied, it should be removed\r\nby means of the attached thread, one end of which has been purposely\r\nleft hanging out of the vagina. Then thoroughly cleanse the vagina with\r\nwarm water, use the solution of Dr. Pierce's Lotion Tablets as suggested\r\nfor the treatment of leucorrhea, and repeat the glycerine application\r\nthe following day or every other day.\r\n\r\nIf there is no irritation or tenderness of the vagina, add one drachm of\r\ntincture of iodine to each ounce of the glycerine, alternating the use\r\nof this with that of pure glycerine; or, the iodine and glycerine may be\r\nused every third day, and the glycerine alone on the two intervening\r\ndays. As the iodine will color the finger somewhat, it is well to know\r\nthat this unpleasant effect may be almost or entirely avoided by coating\r\nthat member with lard, sweet oil, or vaseline. The stain may be readily\r\nremoved with a solution of iodide of potassium. The use of Dr. Pierce's\r\nAntiseptic and Healing Suppositories as advised on an other page under\r\nthe head of Ulceration of the Uterus will aid greatly in effecting a\r\ncure.\r\n\r\nIf your medicine dealer does not have these Suppositories in stock, mail\r\n25 cents in stamps to Dr. R.V. Pierce, Buffalo, N.Y., and a box will be\r\nsent you by return post.\r\n\r\nIt is well to alternate Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery with Dr.\r\nPierce's Favorite Prescription, taking of each three times a day. By\r\npersevering in this course of treatment, nine-tenths of those who are\r\nthus afflicted will improve and be fully restored to health,\r\nfruitfulness and happiness. If barrenness continue, the case should be\r\nunreservedly submitted, either in person or by letter, to a physician\r\nskilled in the diagnosis and treatment of these affections.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing remarks, the reader will perceive that there are a\r\nvariety of diseased conditions, any one of which may produce sterility.\r\nIt is equally true that nearly all these conditions may be easily cured\r\nby proper medical or surgical treatment. A frequent cause of barrenness\r\nis stricture of the neck of the uterus. No medicine that a woman can\r\ntake or have applied will remove this unnatural condition. Fortunately,\r\nhowever, the means to be employed cause no pain, are perfectly safe, and\r\nthe time required to effect a cure is short, rarely over twenty or\r\nthirty days.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISPLACEMENTS OF THE WOMB.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe relative positions of the womb and surrounding organs, when in a\r\nstate of health, are well illustrated by Fig. 1, page 680. The womb is\r\nsupported in its place by resting upon the vaginal walls, and by a broad\r\nligament on either side, as well as by other connective tissues. By\r\ngeneral debility of the system, the supports of the womb, like the other\r\ntissues of the body, become weakened and inadequate to perfectly perform\r\ntheir duty, thus permitting various displacements of that organ.\r\n\r\nPROLAPSUS, OR FALLING OF THE UTERUS, is a common form of displacement.\r\nIt has been erroneously regarded as a local uterine disease, requiring\r\nonly local treatment instead of being considered as a symptom of general\r\nderangement, and, therefore, requiring constitutional treatment. Hence,\r\nvariously devised supporters have been invented to retain the womb in\r\nposition after its replacement. It is a law of physiology, that the\r\nmuscular system is strengthened by use, and that want of exercise\r\nweakens it. The blacksmith's arm is strengthened and developed by daily\r\nexercise. Support his arm in a sling, and the muscles will be greatly\r\nweakened and wasted. So when artificial supports are used to retain the\r\nwomb in position, thereby relieving the supporting ligaments and tissues\r\nof their normal function, the _natural_ supports of the uterus are still\r\nfurther weakened, and the prolapsus will be worse than before when the\r\nartificial support is removed. Besides, all these mechanical\r\ncontrivances are irritating to the tissues of the womb and vagina, and\r\nfrequently produce congestion, inflammation, and even ulceration, thus\r\nrendering the patient's condition much worse than before their\r\nemployment. These worse than useless appliances should never be resorted\r\nto for the temporary relief which they sometimes afford. Constitutional\r\ntreatment together with appropriate applications is the only effectual\r\nmethod of remedying this morbid condition.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS. When the displacement is sufficient to cause any serious\r\ndisturbance, the prominent symptoms are a sensation of dragging and\r\nweight in the region of the womb, pain in the back and loins, inability\r\nto lift weights, great fatigue from walking, leucorrhea, a frequent\r\ndesire to urinate, irritation of the lower bowel, and derangement of the\r\nstomach. The womb may protrude from the vaginal orifice; in very rare\r\ncases, wholly protrudes, and may be inverted.\r\n\r\nCAUSES. As we have already stated, general debility favors prolapsus of\r\nthe womb, but various general and local circumstances and conditions\r\nalso favor its occurrence. Wearing heavy garments supported only by the\r\nhips, compressing the waist and abdomen with tight clothing, thus\r\nforcing the abdominal organs down upon the womb, are fruitful causes of\r\nthis affection. Excesses in sexual intercourse give rise to leucorrhea,\r\nproducing a relaxed condition of the vagina, upon which the womb rests,\r\nand, in this way, one of its supports is weakened. Enlargement of the\r\nuterus from congestion, and inflammation or tumors also favor prolapsus.\r\nAbortion may leave the womb enlarged, its supports weakened, and result\r\nin this displacement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.\r\nRetroflexion, U, Uterus (Womb),\r\nB, Bladder.]\r\n\r\nFLEXIONS AND VERSIONS. Instead of sliding down into the vagina, as in\r\nprolapsus, the uterus is liable to fall or be forced into other\r\nunnatural positions. When the uterus is bent upon itself, it is called\r\n_flexion_. If the bending is backward, it is called _retroflexion_; if\r\nforward, _anteflexion._ Fig. 12, represents the former condition, the\r\nuterus being flexed backward so that the fundus, or upper part of the\r\nwomb, is pressed against the rectum, while the neck of the uterus\r\nremains in its natural position. This is a common form of displacement,\r\nand generally occurs between the ages of fourteen and fifty.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS. The prominent symptoms of retroflexion of the uterus are a\r\nsense of weight in the region of the rectum, difficulty in evacuating\r\nthe bowels, and, sometimes a retention of the feces. There may be\r\nsuppression of the urine and the menses may be diminished in quantity.\r\nIf retroflexion is due to a chronic enlargement of the uterus, caused by\r\nabortion or parturition, the patient suffers from an immoderate\r\nmenstrual flow.\r\n\r\nCAUSES. The principal causes of retroflexion are congestion, enlargement\r\nand tumors of the uterus. Congestion is liable to occur in women\r\npossessing an extremely active temperament, as well as in those of\r\nsedentary and indolent habits. Retroflexion is a common displacement in\r\nboth married and unmarried women; it is a secondary affection, and, when\r\nit is caused by congestion, the menses are painful and reduced in\r\nquantity, and there is pain in the back and a sense of weight in the\r\nregion of the rectum. In some instances, there is a reflex irritation of\r\nthe mammary glands, and a consequent secretion of milk. There may also\r\nbe nausea and vomiting, which often lead to the erroneous opinion that\r\nthe patient is pregnant.\r\n\r\n_Anteflexion_ of the uterus denotes a bending forward of the body and\r\nfundus of the uterus, while the neck remains in its natural position.\r\n\r\nIn versions of the uterus, neither the body nor the neck of the womb is\r\nbent upon itself, but the whole organ is completely turned backward or\r\nforward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.\r\nRetroversion. B, Bladder.\r\nU, Uterus (Womb).]\r\n\r\n_Retroversion_ of the uterus, illustrated by Fig. 13, signifies a change\r\nin the position of the womb, so that the upper, or fundal portion of the\r\norgan drops back toward the concavity of the sacrum, while the neck\r\npreserves a straight line in the opposite direction. The fundus presses\r\nforcibly against the rectum, while the upper part of the vagina bends\r\nabruptly and forms an acute angle near the mouth of the uterus.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS. Retroversion is indicated by bearing-down pains in the loins\r\nand difficulty in evacuating the bowels. The feces may accumulate in the\r\nrectum, because they cannot pass this obstruction.\r\n\r\nCAUSES. Jumping, falling, or undue pressure from the contents of the\r\nabdomen, may suddenly cause retroversion of the uterus. Sometimes\r\nretroversion results from obstinate constipation.\r\n\r\n_Anteversion_. This term designates another unnatural position of the\r\nuterus, in which the fundus, or upper part of the organ, falls forward,\r\nas illustrated by Fig. 14, while the neck points towards the hollow of\r\nthe sacrum. This position of the womb is the reverse of that of\r\nretroversion. In its natural position, the fundus of the uterus is\r\nslightly inclined forward, and any pressure, or forward traction, is\r\nliable to cause it to fall still further in that direction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.\r\nAnteversion, U, Uterus, B, Bladder.]\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS. One of the most common symptoms of anteversion is a frequent\r\ndesire to urinate, in consequence of the pressure of the uterus upon the\r\nbladder. The free flow of the menses is sometimes obstructed.\r\n\r\nCAUSES. The causes are tight lacing, prolapse of the abdominal organs,\r\nweakness of the supporting ligaments, and enervating habits.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. In treating all the various displacements of the uterus, the\r\nprominent indication is to tone up the general system, for by so doing\r\nwe also strengthen the uterine supports.\r\n\r\nDigestion should be improved, the blood enriched, and nutrition\r\nincreased, so that the muscles and ligaments which retain the womb in\r\nposition may become firm and strong. The womb will thus be gradually\r\ndrawn into position by their normal action and firmly supported. It is a\r\ngreat mistake, made by physicians as well as patients, to consider a\r\ndisplacement of the uterus a _local_ disease, requiring only local\r\ntreatment. A restoration of the general health will result in the cure\r\nof these displacements, the uterus will regain its tone and muscular\r\npower, and the local derangement, with its attendant pain and morbid\r\nsymptoms, will disappear.\r\n\r\nIt is true that displacements of the womb may be associated with\r\ninflammation and ulcers, which require local treatment, as elsewhere\r\nsuggested; but simple displacement of the uterus may be remedied by\r\npursuing the following course of sanitary and medical treatment. Sleep\r\non a hard bed, rise early, bathe, and take a short walk before\r\nbreakfast. Dress the body warmly and allow sufficient space for the easy\r\nand full expansion of the lungs. Eat moderately three meals a day, of\r\nthose articles which are nutritious and readily digested. Keep the\r\nbowels regular by the use of proper food. If they are constipated, use\r\nDr. Pierce's Pellets to keep them open and regular. Avoid retaining the\r\nstanding position too long at a time, especially when the symptoms are\r\naggravated by it. Many energetic women disregard their increasing pains,\r\nand keep upon their feet as long as possible. Such a course is extremely\r\ninjurious and should be avoided.\r\n\r\nAs a general restorative and uterine tonic, nothing surpasses Dr.\r\nPierce's Favorite Prescription, which is sold by druggists and\r\naccompanied with full directions for use. If leucorrhea is an attendant\r\nsymptom, the treatment suggested for that condition should be employed.\r\nThe use of Dr. Pierce's Antiseptic and Healing Suppositories, applying\r\none every third night After having first cleansed the vagina and neck of\r\nthe womb thoroughly by the use of warm water and soap as an injection,\r\nwill prove of great benefit in giving strength to the supports of the\r\nwomb and its appendages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\nFig. 22.\r\nFig. 21.\r\nFig. 23.\r\nFig. 24.\r\nFig. 25.\r\nFig. 26.]\r\n\r\nBy persevering in the rational treatment which we have suggested for the\r\nvarious displacements of the womb, nearly all who suffer from such\r\nderangements may be fully restored to health. The patient should not\r\nexpect _speedy_ relief. Considerable time will be necessary to bring the\r\ngeneral system up to a perfect standard of health, and, until this is\r\naccomplished, no great improvement in the distressing symptoms can be\r\nexpected. Mechanical movements are especially effective in this class of\r\ncases. We have successfully treated many obstinate cases in which the\r\ndisplacements were very serious.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nULCERATION OF THE UTERUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nUlceration is the process by which ulcers, or sores, are produced. It is\r\ncharacterized by the secretion of pus or some fetid discharge, and is\r\ncontinued as a local disease through the operation of constitutional\r\ncauses. Ulcers are generally symptoms of other morbid conditions.\r\n\r\nUlcers may form in the _mouth_ or _neck_ of the uterus, and, omitting\r\ncancerous ulcers and those of a syphilitic character, which are\r\nconsidered elsewhere, may be classified as _Granular_ and _Follicular_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.\r\nThe Ferguson Speculum.]\r\n\r\nGRANULAR ULCER. This variety of ulcerative degeneration is the most\r\nfrequent, and may exist for some time without exciting any suspicion in\r\nthe mind of the patient that she is afflicted with any such morbid\r\ncondition. There is local inflammation, and the mouth of the uterus is\r\nuneven, rough, and granular. If an examination be made with the\r\nspeculum, the mouth of the uterus is often found in the condition\r\nrepresented in Fig. 22, Colored Plate IV.\r\n\r\nFigs 15 and 16 represent two different forms of specula. The one\r\nrepresented by Fig. 15 consists of a tube of glass coated with\r\nquicksilver and covered with India rubber, which is thoroughly\r\nvarnished. That represented by Fig. 18 is made of metal and plated. By\r\nusing one of these instruments, the condition of the mouth of the womb\r\ncan be distinctly seen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.\r\nAn Expanding Uterine Speculum.]\r\n\r\nFOLLICULAR ULCER. When the mucous follicles of the neck of the uterus\r\nare inflamed they enlarge and become filled with a fluid having the\r\ncolor and consistency of honey, presenting the appearance illustrated by\r\nFig. 25, Colored Plato IV. This secretion, because of the presence of\r\nthe Inflammation, is not discharged. The follicles, therefore, continue\r\nto enlarge until they burst, and we then see in their place the red,\r\nelevated, angry-looking eminence, which is called a _follicular ulcer_.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS. The severity of the symptoms depends upon the character of the\r\nulceration. It may be simple or associated with purulent leucorrhea and\r\nhemorrhage. If ulceration be slight and local, few symptoms will be\r\npresent; but if it be associated with uterine debility, congestion and\r\ninflammation of the mucous membrane of the uterus, the discharge will be\r\nprofuse, and there will be fixed pain in the back and loins, a\r\nbearing-down sensation, and great difficulty in walking. The discharge\r\nis weakening, as it impoverishes the blood, and thus reduces the\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nCAUSES. Ulceration may be induced by any thing that excites inflammation\r\nof the lining membrane of the mouth and neck of the uterus. The use of\r\npessaries, excessive sexual indulgence, injuries occasioned by giving\r\nbirth to children, congestions, enlargements and displacements, may all\r\noperate as causes.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. We cannot too strongly condemn the practice so popular at the\r\npresent time with physicians generally, of indiscriminately burning all\r\nuterine ulcers with strong caustics, such as nitrate of silver, chromate\r\nof potassium, and other similar escharotics, regardless of the condition\r\nof the general system. Ulcers of the womb must be healed in the same\r\nmanner as those upon any other part of the body. It is an irrational\r\npractice to repeatedly cauterize them, expecting thereby to promote\r\nhealing, while the system is vitiated and the vitality far below the\r\nstandard of health. Enrich the blood, tone up the system, keep the\r\nulcers cleansed by the frequent use of lotions, and they will generally\r\nheal. Caustics often aggravate the irritability and interfere with the\r\nhealing processes of nature. Ladies should not unnecessarily submit to\r\nthe exposure of their persons. If they perseveringly employ the\r\ntreatment which we shall suggest, other local treatment will _very\r\nrarely_ be found necessary. This modern warfare which physicians are\r\nwaging upon the unoffending womb is a most irrational practice. Our\r\ngrandmothers got along very well without exposing themselves to the\r\nhumiliation and tortures of this new-born empiricism. We do not wish to\r\nbe understood as undervaluing or denying the necessity, in rare cases,\r\nof examinations of the uterus, or as being unappreciative of the aid\r\nafforded in such investigations by the speculum, and the beneficial\r\neffects of local applications made directly to the womb through that\r\ninstrument. What we affirm is, that such examinations and applications\r\nare, in the practice of most modern physicians, made unnecessarily\r\nfrequent, resulting many times in lasting injury to the patient.\r\n\r\nGENERAL MEANS. As has already been indicated, constitutional treatment\r\nshould be principally relied upon to cure ulceration of the neck of the\r\nwomb. Put the system in perfect order and the local ulceration cannot\r\nfail to heal. If you have a sore or ulcer upon the leg you very\r\nnaturally reason that there is a fault in the system at large or in the\r\nblood. You do not apply caustics to the sore, but you go to work to\r\nrestore the blood and system to a normal or healthy condition and as\r\nsoon as this is accomplished the open and rebellious sore, or ulcer,\r\nheals of its own accord. All you have to do locally, to stimulate the\r\nulcer to heal, is to keep it well cleansed by the use of Castile soap\r\nand warm water. Just so with ulceration of the womb. Thoroughly cleanse\r\nthe vagina and neck of the womb once a day by the use of warm water and\r\na little soap, applying this _thoroughly_, as directed on page 704,\r\nunder the head of treatment for leucorrhea, and using a solution of Dr.\r\nPierce's Purifying and Strengthening Lotion Tablets as there directed.\r\nAfter thus thoroughly cleansing and purifying the parts, a piece of soft\r\nsponge as large as a hen's egg, to which a bit of cord or strong thread\r\nis attached to facilitate removing it, may be thoroughly wet in pure\r\nglycerine and introduced into the vagina, pressed against the mouth of\r\nthe womb, and allowed to remain there for twelve hours, when it should\r\nbe gently removed by pulling on the attached string. The cleansing\r\nlotion of soap and warm water should be used daily and followed by the\r\nglycerine application.\r\n\r\nEvery third night instead of the glycerine tampon apply one of Dr.\r\nPierce's Antiseptic and Healing Suppositories, pressing it well up\r\nagainst the mouth of the womb, and letting it remain there to slowly\r\ndissolve. This will give far better curative results than the\r\napplication of nitrate of silver or other caustics so generally used by\r\nphysicians. Besides it has the great advantage of being entirely\r\nharmless in any condition of the parts to which it is applied. These\r\nSuppositories are powerfully antiseptic, destroying all offensive odors\r\nand have a soothing and at the same time tonic or strengthening effect\r\nupon the neck of the womb and the vagina.\r\n\r\nIn cases where there is prolapsus or falling of the womb, or Anteversion\r\nor Retroversion, or other displacements the use of the Antiseptic and\r\nHealing Suppositories will be found to be of great benefit in giving\r\nstrength to the supports of the womb and its appendages.\r\n\r\nIf your dealer is not supplied with the Suppositories, inclose 25 cents\r\nin one-cent stamps to us at Buffalo, N.Y., and a package will be sent\r\nyou, post-paid.\r\n\r\nWe are fully aware that this thorough and _systematic_ course of\r\ntreatment is slightly troublesome in its application, but what system of\r\ntreatment that can promise similar success is not?\r\n\r\nThis course of treatment must be _rigidly_ adhered to for several weeks\r\nbefore we can expect a complete cure of the ulcers and the arrest of the\r\nconsequent leucorrheal discharge.\r\n\r\nTHE SHEET ANCHOR OF HOPE. Do not fail to bear in mind that no difference\r\nhow good the lotions and other local applications may be, your _chief_\r\nreliance in all cases of ulceration of the womb, as well as in those of\r\nsimple leucorrhea, must be upon _thorough constitutional_ treatment. To\r\nthis end Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery should be taken three\r\ntimes a day in doses of from one to one-and-a-half teaspoonfuls one hour\r\nbefore each meal, and in the middle of the forenoon, in the middle of\r\nthe afternoon, and just before retiring for the night, a like amount of\r\nDr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription should be taken. The use of these\r\nblood cleansing and invigorating tonic medicines should be kept up\r\n_persistently_ for several weeks; for you must not expect a perfect cure\r\ntoo soon in a malady that has become chronic and seated. The disease\r\ndoes not become established hastily, but is slow in its inception and\r\nprogress, and will only gradually and slowly yield to the best of\r\ntreatment, which we believe we have already pointed out. Followed\r\n_earnestly, faithfully_ and _persistently_, the use of the means which\r\nwe have suggested will rarely, if ever, fail.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nURINARY FISTULA.\r\n\r\n\r\nA fistula, or false passage, is sometimes formed between the bladder and\r\nthe vagina, between the bladder and the uterus, or between the urethra\r\nand the vagina. This passage allows the urine to escape through it into\r\nthe vagina, and is a source of great annoyance and suffering. This\r\naffection is most commonly due to sloughing, caused by severe and\r\nlong-continued pressure upon the parts during child-labor. It is also\r\nsometimes produced by the unskillful use of forceps and other\r\ninstruments employed by midwives. Syphilitic and other ulcerations may\r\nso destroy the tissues as to form a urinary fistula.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. The treatment is purely surgical, and consists in paring the\r\nedges of the opening so as to make them raw, bringing them together and\r\nholding the parts thus by means of stitches until they heal. By the aid\r\nof a speculum, properly curved scissors, needles with long handles, fine\r\nsilver wire, and a few other instruments and appliances, the skillful\r\nsurgeon can close a urinary fistula with almost as much ease as he can\r\nclose a wound on the surface of the body.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISORDERS INCIDENT TO PREGNANCY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile some women pass through the whole period of pregnancy without\r\ninconvenience, others suffer from various sympathetic disturbances, as\r\n\"morning sickness,\" impaired appetite, constipation, diarrhea, headache,\r\n\"heart-burn,\" fainting fits, difficult breathing, and sometimes\r\nconvulsions. A strong nervous sympathy exists between the uterus and\r\nevery part of the system and this sympathy is greatly intensified by\r\npregnancy, causing the distressing symptoms above mentioned.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. By proper treatment, most of these evils can be obviated and\r\nthe patient made comfortable. By the moderate use of such a nervine and\r\nuterine tonic as Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription, this nervous\r\nirritability may be controlled or subdued, and the disagreeable symptoms\r\nthus avoided.\r\n\r\nWhile the female is pregnant, she should avoid all compression of the\r\nwaist and abdomen. For this reason tight clothing, stays, or corsets\r\nmust be discarded. She should also carefully regulate her diet,\r\nselecting that which is most nutritious and easily digested.\r\n\r\nThe nausea which occurs in the morning may generally be avoided by\r\npartaking of a little light food and a cup of tea or coffee before\r\nleaving the bed. If vomiting occurs, and the ejected matter be very\r\nacid, carbonate of magnesia, taken in tablespoonful doses, or some\r\nalkali with aromatics, or pulverized charcoal, which can be obtained at\r\nany drug store, will afford relief. If constipation or diarrhea be\r\nexperienced, small doses of Dr. Pierce's Pellets should be employed--one\r\nor two only at a time. Want of appetite, headache, or a tendency to\r\nconvulsions, can be generally overcome by a persistent use of Dr.\r\nPierce's Favorite Prescription, which should be taken in teaspoonful\r\ndoses three or four times each day. Indeed, this valuable medicine not\r\nonly relieves the distressing symptoms which frequently attend the\r\npregnant state, but also prepares the system for the ordeal of\r\nparturition (delivery). One or two bottles of this nervine and tonic\r\nused previous to confinement, will, in many cases, save hours of\r\nterrible suffering, besides regulating the system, and thus insuring a\r\nspeedy recovery. We have received the heartfelt thanks of hundreds of\r\ngrateful mothers for the inestimable benefit thus conferred. The\r\nFavorite Prescription is perfectly safe and harmless to use _at all\r\ntimes_ and under all circumstances in the doses above prescribed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOVARIAN AND UTERINE TUMORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have space only to give a brief outline of the characteristics and\r\ntreatment of the most frequent classes of tumors which affect the\r\novaries and uterus.\r\n\r\nOVARIAN TUMORS generally consist of one or more cysts or sacs, developed\r\nwithin the ovary, and filled with a fluid, or semi-fluid matter, which\r\nis formed in their interior. The cysts vary in size, in some instances\r\nbeing not larger than a pea, while in others they are capable of\r\ncontaining many quarts of fluid. In one case operated upon at the\r\nInvalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute, thirty-five pints of fluid were\r\ntaken from three cysts.\r\n\r\nThe effect of ovarian tumors on the duration of life is shown by the\r\nstatistics of Stafford Lee. Of 123 cases, nearly a third died within a\r\nyear, more than one-half within two years from the first development of\r\nreliable symptoms, while only seventeen lived for nine years or upwards.\r\n\r\nFIBROID TUMORS of the uterus are composed of fibrous tissue, identical\r\nin structure with that of the uterine walls. They are met with in all\r\nsizes, from that of a small shot to that of a mass capable of filling\r\nthe entire cavity of the abdomen. Cases are on record in which these\r\ntumors have attained the weight of seventy pounds.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which fibroid tumors terminate life is generally by\r\nprostration and debility produced by pressure on, and consequently,\r\ninterference with, the function of some one or more of the organs\r\nessential to life; or by anæmia and debility, produced by the severe\r\nhemorrhages, which the intra-uterine or sub-mucous form not infrequently\r\ninduces.\r\n\r\nPOLYPI OR POLYPOID TUMORS of the uterus are of three kinds, cystic,\r\nmucous and fibrous. They vary greatly in size, sometimes being as large\r\nas a tea-cup; and their point of attachment may be extensive or consist\r\nonly of a small pedicle. The cystic and mucous varieties may spring from\r\nany portion of the mucous surface of the uterus, but they are more\r\nfrequently met with growing from the mucous membrane lining the cervical\r\ncanal, and pendent from the mouth of the womb, as represented in Fig. 21\r\nand in Fig. 26, Colored Plate IV; while the fibrous variety generally\r\ngrows from the sub-mucous tissue at or near the fundus, or upper\r\nportion, of the uterus.\r\n\r\nThe most prominent symptoms of polypoid growths are hemorrhage, which is\r\nalmost invariably present, leucorrhea, pain, backache, and a sense of\r\nweight and dragging in the pelvis.\r\n\r\nThe best method of treatment, and, in fact, the only effectual one, is\r\nremoval with the _écraseur_, polypus forceps, or galvano-cautery. The\r\noperation is usually attended with little or no pain.\r\n\r\nFOR MORE THAN TWENTY-FIVE YEARS the physicians of the Invalids' Hotel\r\nand Surgical Institute, have been successfully treating tumors by means\r\nof electricity. More recently, the medical profession has quite\r\ngenerally adopted electrical applications in response to the advice of\r\nApostoli, of Paris. The plan used however is crude. It does not compare\r\nin results with the successful and safe procedure that our surgeons have\r\ninvented and pursued.\r\n\r\nElectrical treatment will destroy the life of ovarian and fibroid tumors\r\nif applied early and after the improved methods so long used at our\r\nInstitution. The destructive effect of electricity is modified by the\r\nintroduction of certain electro-chemical applications so that it attacks\r\nand kills only the cells of the tumor.\r\n\r\nTHE VERY LARGE OVARIAN TUMORS, however, are not amenable to treatment by\r\nthis process. The walls of their cysts become so thin and weak, while\r\nthe pressure of the fluid from within is so great, that sudden and\r\nspontaneous rupture is liable to occur at any time and produce death.\r\nRemoval by a cutting operation is necessary in such cases. Fortunately\r\nthis procedure, as skillfully modified and perfected by experience, has,\r\nin the hands of our surgeons, proven free from the dangers and hazard\r\ncommon to Ovariotomy. This is due to skillful operation and to the fact\r\nthat in our Institution the sanitary arrangements are as perfect as it\r\nis possible to make them. Everything is at hand in the way of\r\ninstruments and appliances likely to be required, and the entire\r\nprocedure is conducted upon the principles of perfect cleanliness and\r\nantisepsis, which obviate the risk of inflammation and blood-poisoning.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, our nurses have had such fine training and such a vast\r\nexperience in their attendance upon such cases, that wants are\r\nanticipated, and details, that would escape those not so well qualified,\r\nare looked after so thoughtfully and vigilantly that the convalescence\r\nis rapid, as well as being in every way comfortable and safe. Under such\r\nconditions\r\n\r\nOUR SURGEONS HAVE COMPLETED A LONG LIST OF REMOVALS OF OVARIAN TUMORS\r\nWITHOUT A SINGLE DEATH!\r\n\r\nWe are, therefore, _warranted_ in stating that\r\n\r\nTHE DANGERS DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF THESE TUMORS ARE FAR GREATER THAN THE\r\nSLIGHT RISKS OF REMOVAL BY THE SKILLFUL METHODS EMPLOYED BY OUR\r\nSURGEONS.\r\n\r\nOwing to a change made in the anæsthetic used, the painful and\r\npersistent vomiting that often follows abdominal operations is\r\nprevented. This does away with the greatest of all the dangers attendant\r\nupon the operation of Ovariotomy, and favors speedy recovery. Food, as\r\nadministered in the form of artificially digested and concentrated\r\nnourishment, is readily retained. The strength is thus rapidly restored,\r\nand the healing process hastened.\r\n\r\nIt is generally supposed that the size of the opening made through the\r\nabdominal walls is large, proportionate to the size of these tumors.\r\nThis is an error. Even in the largest cystic tumors where the\r\ndevelopment is immense, a small incision only, is made--simply\r\nsufficient to bring the walls of the tumor in view and admit, perhaps,\r\ntwo or three fingers. The tumor is then rapidly emptied of its contents\r\nby means of a powerful suction apparatus. Adhesions, if any exist, are\r\nthen carefully removed, and hemorrhage therefrom prevented; after which\r\nthe large sac of the tumor, which when collapsed is like a thin bag, is\r\nreadily drawn out through the small opening in the abdomen and removed.\r\nThe small pedicle or cord-like mass of vessels that supplies the tumor,\r\nare then carefully treated after a plan invented by, and peculiar to,\r\nourselves, which effectually prevents any bleeding, and, at the same\r\ntime, does not leave any irritating substance, such as burned and\r\ncharred flesh, rubber, silk, or any other unabsorbable material, within\r\nthe abdomen. The parts are left unbruised and without any poisonous\r\ngerms in contact.\r\n\r\nOur surgeons have met with phenomenal success in removing Ovarian\r\nTumors, by the operation of Ovariotomy. Thus far, in a career extending\r\nover a long period of time and embracing the removal of a long list of\r\nthese morbid growths, they have not had a single fatal case.\r\n\r\nThe following cases illustrate our method of treatment in a few of the\r\nmany cases that have been under our care. Each case is typical of a\r\nclass:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.\r\nThe shape and position of the Tumor are shown by the dotted line.]\r\n\r\nCASE I A married woman, aged 38. Had never given birth to a child. About\r\nfour years before coming under our observation, she discovered a small\r\nbunch, as she expressed it, in the left ovarian region, which gradually\r\nincreased in size until, when she consulted us, it caused considerable\r\npain in the region of the liver from pressure, and interfered with\r\nrespiration. Her general health was becoming much impaired. She stated\r\nthat she had consulted a prominent gynecologist in this city, who had\r\ntold her that the attachments of the tumor were so extensive that\r\novariotomy (removal with the knife) was out of the question, and that,\r\ntherefore, he could only give her palliative treatment. This unfavorable\r\nprognosis only added mental anguish and despair to her physical\r\nsuffering. On examination, we found a large multilocular cystic tumor,\r\nrepresented by Fig. 17, with very thick walls, extending from the left\r\novarian region obliquely upwards and to the right, so that it pressed\r\nmore upon the short ribs on the right side than it did upon the left,\r\nbut which filled the entire cavity of the abdomen. The attachments, as\r\nthe doctor whom she had previously consulted had stated, were so\r\nextensive that its removal with the knife could not be thought of. We\r\nwere not disposed, however, to give the case up as hopeless. We told her\r\nthat we would do what we could for her, but as to what the result of our\r\ntreatment would be, we could not definitely say. She placed her case in\r\nour hands, and we resorted to the above described treatment. She was\r\ntreated two and three times per week for more than two months, at the\r\nend of which time, the tumor had decreased in size fully two-thirds. It\r\nhas ever since remained stationary, and has given her no trouble or\r\ninconvenience whatever. It is now seven years since we treated her.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18.\r\nU, Uterus. B, Bladder. R, Rectum. T, Tumor.]\r\n\r\nCASE II. A young lady of 23; unmarried. About six months previous to\r\nconsulting us, she had discovered a tumor of about the size of an egg,\r\nIn the region of the left ovary, which had been gradually increasing in\r\nsize. On examination, we found the morbid growth to be about the size of\r\na quart bowl, and evidently composed of several cysts with thick walls.\r\nShe experienced no pain, and but slight inconvenience from its presence,\r\nbut she was in great mental distress. She was an only daughter, and her\r\nmother had died a few years previously from the shock and hemorrhage\r\nresulting from an operation for the removal of a large ovarian tumor,\r\nperformed by the late lamented Dr. Peaslee, of New York. The same course\r\nwas pursued in this case, and at the end of six weeks' treatment, the\r\ntumor was reduced to the size of an egg, and has remained so ever since,\r\nnow more than three years.\r\n\r\nCASE III. A woman,37 years of age; married six years; no children. She\r\nhad suffered for eight years from profuse menstruation and dysmenorrhea,\r\nwith a membranous discharge, and, for several months before consulting\r\nus, she had experienced severe pain and a soreness in the pelvic organs.\r\nHer bowels were obstinately constipated, it being next to impossible for\r\nher to have an evacuation, and she possessed a pale and careworn\r\ncountenance. Upon examination, we discovered a hard, incompressible\r\ntumor, represented in Fig. 18, attached to the posterior wall of the\r\nuterus, which caused anteversion of the womb, and which pressed upon the\r\nrectum so as to produce great obstruction. She was treated by means of\r\nelectrolysis, with injections into the substance of the growth, for one\r\nmonth, at the end of which she resumed home, with the tumor reduced from\r\nthe size of a pint bowl to the size of an egg, and her health greatly\r\nimproved. After going home the tumor continued to grow less until, at\r\nthe end of a few months, her home physicians could detect no trace of\r\nit, and she has remained well since, for more than five years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19.\r\nU, Uterus. T, Tumor.]\r\n\r\nCASE IV. A lady aged 36: married 13 years; no children. She complained\r\nof severe pain in the back and a frequent desire to urinate.\r\nMenstruation was profuse, and the bowels were constipated. On\r\nexamination, we found an inter-mural fibroid tumor, represented in Figs.\r\n19, developed in the anterior wall of the uterus, and pressing upon the\r\nbladder. The womb was enlarged, measuring three inches in depth, and was\r\nslightly anteflected. A month's treatment, with electrolysis and\r\ninjections into the tumor, arrested the growth and diminished the size\r\nmore than one-half, and caused the unpleasant symptoms to disappear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20.\r\nU, Uterus. T, Tumor.]\r\n\r\nCASE V. A married lady, 26 years of age; had borne no children, but had\r\nhad several abortions, brought about intentionally. Six months before\r\nconsulting us, a tumor, about the size of an egg, was discovered by her\r\nhome physician. It grew steadily from the time of its discovery until,\r\nwhen we made an examination, it was found to be about the size of an\r\nordinary tea-cup. It was developed in the posterior wall of the womb, as\r\nrepresented in Fig. 20. Three weeks' treatment reduced the tumor two\r\nthirds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21.\r\nU, Uterus. P, Polypus.]\r\n\r\nCASE VI. A widow lady, aged 52. She was examined ten years ago by two of\r\nthe most distinguished physicians of New Haven, Conn., who pronounced\r\nher sufferings due to cancer of the uterus. She was then suffering from\r\nrepeated hemorrhages, and other symptoms. They gave her palliative\r\ntreatment, and told her that to interfere with the morbid growth would\r\nonly shorten her life, and that by leaving it alone she might live\r\nseveral years. By and by the hemorrhages ceased and she passed the\r\nchange of life, but she continued to be troubled with a sensation of\r\nfullness in the pelvis, pains in the back, and frequent headaches. On\r\nexamination we found not a cancer, but a large polypus, as represented\r\nin Fig. 21, which had caused all the trouble. It was quickly removed,\r\nwithout pain, and her health restored. Thus, through an error of\r\ndiagnosis, she was made to suffer physically and mentally for ten, long\r\nyears of her life, in constant dread of a horrible death.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONIALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile we have a great cloud of witnesses testifying to the efficacy of\r\nour treatment of the diseases described in this volume, yet for lack of\r\nspace we can here introduce only the following:\r\n\r\n\r\nLARGE FIBRO-CYSTIC TUMOR.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Miss Duke.]\r\n\r\nPRONOUNCED INCURABLE BY MANY EMINENT SURGEONS. HEALTH RESTORED AND TUMOR\r\nREMOVED WITHOUT CUTTING.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL, ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--I cheerfully send you the following testimonial, and hope\r\nit may induce some sick person to seek relief where it is sure to be\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nWe never truly appreciate health until it forsakes us.\r\n\r\nFor six years, I suffered all the tortures and fears attendant on the\r\ngrowth and development of a fibro-cystic tumor. I tried to have the\r\ntumor removed, but found it impossible. I had the very best medical\r\nadvice the South affords, but every physician rendered the same verdict,\r\n'incurable.' How that word, for months, rang in my ears--'INCURABLE.' It\r\nseemed stamped on my mind in letters of fire. What I suffered, both in\r\nmind and body, cannot be imagined. But for my unbounded faith in God's\r\ngoodness and mercy, I doubt not, I would have given up and died. But I\r\ntrusted in Him to direct me in the way to find relief. One hope stood\r\nout before me like a beacon light; and that was to find the means to go\r\nto Buffalo, N.Y., to Dr. Pierce's famous Invalids' Hotel and Surgical\r\nInstitute. At last the opportunity came, and I bid my loved ones a sad\r\nfarewell, (not one of them ever expected to see me again, alive) and\r\nwith a sister to relieve me of every care on the journey, we started for\r\nthe Institute.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at the Invalids' Hotel, I was too sick and fatigued to treat\r\nwith civility the sweet-faced, lady-like housekeeper who received me, or\r\nthe gentle nurses who tried so patiently and kindly to minister to my\r\nwants.\r\n\r\nI had read a good deal about the Invalids' Hotel, and expected to see\r\nwonderful things; but like Sheba's Queen, I could truthfully say, 'the\r\nhalf had never been told.' The many ways, means, and appliances, for the\r\nrelief of poor sufferers surpassed a thousand fold anything I had ever\r\nimagined could come within the scope of human skill. The skilled\r\nphysicians were not only able and attentive, but on meeting one, if it\r\nwere every day, they always had a ready smile, a warm hand clasp, and an\r\nencouraging word, which alone, would make one feel better and at home.\r\nThe trained nurses were attentive and kind.\r\n\r\nEvery department was cleanliness itself, and kept at such an even\r\ntemperature, even to the halls, that during my four months' stay, I\r\nnever had the slightest cold. Not only the comforts of life, but every\r\nluxury that the most exacting could demand, were fully supplied. I saw\r\nmany poor sufferers, from various diseases, made well and happy, and I\r\ntoo, with the other happy ones, found relief, and that without the use\r\nof the knife or an anæsthetic of any kind. I would urge all poor chronic\r\nsufferers, it matters not what the trouble may be, to go to Dr. Pierce's\r\nInstitute and be cured. If any one similarly afflicted cares to know\r\nmore of my case, I will gladly answer any questions, if she will only\r\nwrite me, and enclose addressed and stamped envelope in which to reply.\r\nDuring my stay at the Invalids' Hotel I never lacked for anything that\r\nwilling hands and warm hearts could supply, and I came away feeling that\r\nI was leaving a sweet, luxurious home and many warm friends, but with a\r\nnew lease of life and perfect confidence in the ability of the\r\nphysicians, for I know I could not possibly have lived two months\r\nlonger, had I not found relief. To-day I am well, rosy and happy, with a\r\nheart full of lasting gratitude for the kind treatment and cure which I\r\nreceived at the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly.\r\n    Miss DELAINE DUKE,\r\n    Clanton, Chilton Co., Ala.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLYPOID TUMOR OF UTERUS WEIGHING OVER FIVE POUNDS.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Miss Bolin.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--After many trials my doctors here had given up all efforts\r\nto cure me. A tumor that had existed almost from my childhood was\r\ngradually killing me. From frequent hemorrhages, I had become as pale\r\nand bloodless as a ghost, and so weak as to be scarcely able to stand or\r\nwalk. Frequently the loss of blood was so great as to cause such long\r\nfainting spells that my family thought me past mortal help. How I lived\r\nto get to your place is yet a matter of wonder.\r\n\r\nWe appreciated the fact that in the skill of your surgeon lay my last\r\nand only hope. The result proved his abilities. The restoration of my\r\nhealth, when it was so generally and for so long despaired of, was\r\nmiraculous, and I cannot sufficiently express my gratitude and thanks.\r\n\r\nThe comfort that was given by the kindly attention of your nurses is one\r\nof the very agreeable memories of your home-like and pleasant\r\nInstitution. With much gratitude, I am,\r\n\r\n    Respectfully yours,\r\n    Miss ANNIE BOLIN, Leon, Kan.\r\n\r\nNOTE--The above case had been pronounced cancer of the womb by home\r\nphysicians.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIBROID TUMOR. CURED WITHOUT CUTTING.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mrs. Drennen.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--I cheerfully give a testimonial of my treatment at your\r\nInstitution, hoping it may induce others to avail themselves of your\r\nskill. In December, 1890, I went to you, after suffering five years with\r\ntwo fibroid tumors of the uterus. The tumors had grown rapidly for six\r\nmonths prior to my going to you for treatment, and had become quite\r\npainful. Under your treatment they entirely disappeared and my health\r\nwas entirely restored. The treatment I received from your able corps of\r\nphysicians and nurses was all that could be desired, and I would further\r\nstate that your Hotel and Surgical Institute possess all the\r\nrequirements for making invalids comfortable and happy.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly,\r\n    VANIA E. DRENNEN,\r\n    Nelson, Portage Co., O.\r\n\r\n\r\nOVARIAN TUMOR OF 62 POUNDS WEIGHT REMOVED.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mrs. Matson. ]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--I hereby certify that I had safely removed, without\r\nrealizing any pain, a large cyst, or Multilocular Tumor (ovarian)\r\nweighing 62 pounds, by your surgeons. Then, with kind and watchful\r\ntreatment, the care of good and faithful nurses, and by the blessing of\r\nan all-wise Providence, I was sitting up in twelve days from that time;\r\nhad no inflammation or fever, kept gaining, and in five weeks returned\r\nhome. I am feeling better than I have for two or three years. I\r\ncheerfully and truthfully recommend the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical\r\nInstitute to all afflicted as I was--with tumors, or any chronic\r\ndisease. The rooms are large and pleasant, the best of food is served,\r\nand everything possible is done by the physicians, nurses, and\r\nattendants connected with the Institution, to render the visits of the\r\nafflicted pleasant and desirable.\r\n\r\nAccept the grateful thanks of my husband and myself for your good care\r\nand great kindness to me during my stay at your Hotel, and I wish you\r\nall great success.\r\n\r\n    Very respectfully,\r\n    MRS. ELISHA MATSON,\r\n    Watte Flats, Chautauqua Co., N.Y.\r\n\r\n\r\nUTERINE FIBROID TUMOR.\r\n\r\nTHE FOLLOWING IS FROM THE EMINENT LADY PHYSICIAN AND POPULAR LECTURER,\r\nMRS. JENNIE V.S. WILCOX, MD\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Jennie V.S. Wilcox, M.D. ]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--The _least_ return one can render for an invaluable\r\nservice, the saving of a life, is an acknowledgment of the same. Mine\r\nwas a long-standing, stubborn, constitutional difficulty; chronic, and\r\ndefying _all_ previous treatment. Under the care of the doctors of the\r\nelegantly appointed Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute the disease\r\nyielded. Could I persuade some of my fashionable friends to spend a\r\nsummer or winter at Dr. Pierce's rather than at \"resorts\" more or less\r\nunsuited to weary or sick people, there might rise up an improved\r\ngeneration. The electrical appliances at the Invalids' Hotel are\r\nprobably the finest in the world. With them the administration of\r\nelectricity for the absorption and removal of all abnormal growths,\r\nespecially in my sex, is an _assured science_, and no experiment. I\r\ncordially commend all my fellow sufferers to the tender care of the\r\nInvalids' Hotel.\r\n\r\n    Yours very respectfully,\r\n    JENNIE V.S. WILCOX, M.D.\r\n    Saratoga Springs, N.Y.\r\n\r\n\r\nOVARIAN ABSCESS.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mrs. Keach.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--It is with pleasure that I can testify to the skillful\r\ntreatment received at the hands of your surgeon specialists. I had been\r\ngiven up to die, with an abdominal tumor and abscess. My case was not\r\nunderstood, before coming to you. Although operated upon twice\r\nunsuccessfully by others, my life was despaired of. I am happy to state\r\nthat after a few weeks' stay in your Institution, with a skillful\r\noperation which owing to my extreme feebleness, was performed without\r\nany Chloroform or Ether (local anæsthesia only being employed), and\r\nwhich resulted in the removal of the tumor and abscess, I was perfectly\r\ncured, and have since enjoyed excellent health. I am now restored to my\r\nchildren and family, and have much to thank you for. The kindness and\r\nattention received from your physicians and nurses while in the hotel\r\ncould not be better, and I wish to praise them all highly.\r\n\r\n    Very truly yours, MRS. ANNA KEACH,\r\n    60 Bissell Ave., Buffalo.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUFFERED FOR 20 YEARS.\r\n\r\nOVARIAN DISEASE WITH INFLAMMATION OF ABDOMINAL ORGANS AND GREAT NERVOUS\r\nPROSTRATION.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mrs. Gibbons.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--I most gladly express my appreciation of the treatment I\r\nreceived at the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute at Buffalo. When\r\nI first applied to you for treatment I could sit up but a few minutes\r\neach day, and my physician had told me I never could be any better. I\r\nbegan to improve very soon after receiving and commencing to use your\r\nmedicines. I continued to use them for some months, following the\r\nspecial instructions faithfully as I could, and steadily improved in\r\nhealth. My trouble was of such a nature that it was necessary for me to\r\nreceive personal treatment, and I spent six weeks at your Institute. The\r\nkindness of physicians and attendants is everything that can be wished.\r\nIt is now two years since I have had any of your medicines, and I have\r\ntaken no others since, and my health is very good indeed. I can hardly\r\nrealize that I am the same person that used to suffer so much for twenty\r\nyears or more.\r\n\r\n    Very respectfully,\r\n    MRS. M. GIBBONS, Franklin, Delaware Co., N.Y.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASED OVARY.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, 683 Main St., Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mrs. Tanner.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--In the Autumn of '88, I had an ovary removed at the\r\nInvalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute, Buffalo. The operation was\r\nperformed with consummate skill. The Hotel is first-class in every\r\nrespect, being at once a Christian Hospital and Home. The skill of man,\r\nas exercised there, seems all that God designed it to be.\r\n\r\nI cheerfully add my testimonial as I consider the Institution first\r\nclass in every respect.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly,\r\n    MRS. ELLEN F. TANNER,\r\n    Leavenworth, Kans.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIBROID TUMOR OF UTERUS.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mrs. Sleeper.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--There is no endorsement that the faculty of your Institute\r\ncould ask that I would not willingly give. I fully realize that I owe\r\nnot only my good health, but my life to the wonderful treatment received\r\nat the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute, and would earnestly\r\nrecommend any person needing the best medical or surgical attention to\r\ngo for relief and cure to your Institution at Buffalo, N.Y. Words are\r\ninadequate to express the gratitude I owe you in so successfully\r\ntreating my case.\r\n\r\n    Very truly yours, Mrs. C.B. SLEEPER.\r\n    Brainerd, Minn.\r\n\r\n\r\nOVARIAN TUMOR MADE UP OF SMALL CYSTS (MULTILOCULAR).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mrs. Crissman.]\r\n\r\nIt grew to enormous size in but five months. The patient, a young\r\nunmarried woman, left home expecting to die. She had several physicians.\r\nNone of them could give her any definite information as to the nature of\r\nthe growth or other than unfavorable expectations as to its probable\r\neffects.\r\n\r\nIt was successfully removed. The patient being able to be up and around\r\nin about two weeks with no unfavorable symptoms. Cure perfect. WORLD'S\r\nDISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n_My Dear Doctors_--Many months have passed since I have written you\r\nconcerning my health. I have remained perfectly well, and, in fact, my\r\nhealth was never better than since the tumor was removed.\r\n\r\nYou will remember my case: The tumor had only grown about five months,\r\nbut it was of immense size, and I had despaired of life, and my family\r\nthought that I would not return alive from your Institution. Your\r\nskillful operation and removal of the tumor, which weighed over thirty\r\npounds, with the kind nursing and good attention given me afterwards,\r\nbrought me through sound and well. To you I feel that I owe all thanks.\r\nMy prayer is for the success of the World's Dispensary Medical\r\nAssociation. You saved my life after I had given up all hope. The kind\r\ncare that all gave me was something that could not be paid for with\r\nmoney. It was like being at home. I send you my picture, which will give\r\nyou some idea of the change for the better in my looks. I am now married\r\nand am very happy.\r\n\r\n    Very respectfully, MRS. P.S.

And since that\r\ntime I have two boys, healthy, and growing as strong as can be, and I\r\nfeel very well satisfied with the care of the good and faithful nurses\r\nand physicians.\r\n\r\nI cheerfully and truthfully recommend the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical\r\nInstitute to all afflicted as I was with tumors, or any chronic disease.\r\nI send you my picture which will give you some idea of the change for\r\nthe better in my looks.\r\n\r\nAccept the grateful thanks of my husband and myself for your good care\r\nand great kindness to me during my stay at your hotel and our wishes for\r\nyour best success.

The\r\ntumor that caused my sufferings had gradually developed during a period\r\nof several years. The trouble induced an inflammation of the bladder and\r\nI had to endure that torment in addition. There were times when I could\r\nnot touch my feet to the floor. Walking was an agony that I could hardly\r\nbear. I faithfully tried good physicians and the various remedies and\r\ntreatments that were recommended to me without any satisfactory relief.\r\nSo I made up my mind to go to your institution. I am now very thankful.\r\nEvery one I met with in your place seemed to help me to get well.\r\n\r\nYou have got not only the most skillful physicians and nurses but they\r\nare also the kindest and most agreeable that I have ever met. Your hotel\r\nis comfortable, home-like and perfectly clean.\r\n\r\nThe treatment was wonderfully successful in my case. The removal of the\r\ntumor was accomplished without pain. I can highly endorse local\r\nanesthesia instead of using chloroform or ether. My recovery was rapid\r\nand I continue in good health and think of you all with thanks and good\r\nwishes.\r\n\r\n    Very truly yours,\r\n    MRS.

I am perfectly well and enjoying as good\r\nhealth as ever I did. The treatment you so skillfully applied has\r\ncompletely restored my health, and I feel that I owe you a debt of\r\ngratitude that I can never repay. I am constantly sounding your praise\r\namong my friends, and know that I can never speak of you in too high\r\nterms. I once despaired of ever feeling well,--to-day, I am jolly and\r\nlike another being. May you long be spared to minster to the afflicted.\r\n\r\n    Very respectfully,\r\n    MRS.

Words fail to express what I endured at\r\nthis time. Only those who have passed through a similar experience can\r\nimagine the distressing symptoms accompanying this disease; I could\r\nneither eat nor sleep, was growing very thin in flesh and life seemed a\r\nburden to me.\r\n\r\nThis was my condition when I wrote to your Institution for help. I\r\nreceived a very encouraging letter and commenced treatment at once. I\r\nhad not used their remedies a week before I began to feel better, and as\r\nI continued the treatment my health gradually improved. All the\r\ndistressing symptoms have disappeared and my general health is restored.\r\nAccept my sincere thanks for the interest manifested in my case and the\r\nhappy results obtained. I am now the mother of a fine baby girl, and I\r\nshall ever remember to whom I owe my present health and good fortune.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly,\r\n    MRS. J.D.

My disease was of very long standing and had baffled the\r\nskill of our home physicians. I went to the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical\r\nInstitute, and received treatment of their specialist. Under his\r\nskillful care and kind attention I soon regained my strength and felt\r\nthat my former life and ambition were again restored to me. I cannot\r\nspeak in too high praise of this famous Institution; the rooms are large\r\nand cheerful, the food of the very best, the nurses kind and attentive,\r\nand the staff of physicians and surgeons skillful and of large\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\n    Yours respectfully,\r\n    MRS.

I took six\r\nbottles of your \"Favorite Prescription,\" and was entirely cured of both\r\nin six months; it is four years this month, since I was entirely well of\r\nboth those diseases and have never had any signs of their appearance\r\nsince, and I am satisfied the \"Favorite Prescription\" saved my life, for\r\nI could hardly walk around, when I commenced taking your medicine, and I\r\nthink it is a God's blessing to me, and a great credit to you that I\r\never took your medicine, for had I not taken it, I think I would have\r\nbeen in the grave now, and I can highly recommend it to all who suffer\r\nfrom these two complaints.\r\n\r\nI was pronounced incurable by the best doctors here in the West. I gave\r\nup all hopes and made up my mind that I was to be taken away from my\r\nhusband and baby of two years old. I was sick all of the time--could not\r\neat anything at all. In one week, after beginning the use of your\r\nmedicine, my stomach was so much better that I could eat anything; I\r\ncould see that I was gaining all over, and my husband then went and got\r\nme six bottles: I took three of them and my stomach did not bother me\r\nany more.\r\n\r\nWe sent to you and got the People's Common Sense Medical Adviser, and\r\nfound my case described just as I was; we did what the book told us, in\r\nevery way; in one month's time I could see I was much better than I had\r\nbeen; we still kept on just as the book told us, and in three months I\r\nstopped taking medicine, only three times a day, and continued for some\r\ntime in that way, and to-day, I can proudly say I am a well woman. Yes,\r\nam well, strong and healthy. I am so glad and thankful to you, Doctor,\r\nfor my good health, for well do I know you are the one that cured me.\r\n\r\nWhen I began to take your medicine my face was poor and eyes looked\r\ndead. I could not enjoy myself any where, I was tired and sick all the\r\ntime. I could hardly do my housework, but now I do that and tend a big\r\ngarden, help my husband and take in sewing.\r\n\r\n    Yours respectfully,\r\n    MRS. MARY F. COVELL, Scotland, Bon Homme Co., So.

I doctored with seven different doctors and got\r\nno relief; then I took almost all kinds of patent medicines and got no\r\nrelief from them, but got worse all the time, when I chanced to get one\r\nof your little pamphlets.\r\n\r\nI thought I would write to you, and waited as I thought to hear that\r\nthere was no help for me; when my answer came and you said you could\r\ncure me great was my joy. I had taken your medicine about a month when I\r\nbegan to improve and in a few months was entirely cured.\r\n\r\nMy recovery was like coming out of the dark into the light, so great was\r\nthe change. I will advise all sufferers to go to you for relief--I don't\r\nthink they will be disappointed. When I commenced taking your medicine I\r\nweighed 94 pounds, now I weigh 125 pounds.\r\n\r\nI do not know how to thank you for all the good your remedies did me,\r\nWith heart-felt thanks I am,\r\n\r\n    Sincerely yours, MRS. AMANDA C. AUSTIN,\r\n    Burden, Cowley Co., Kansas.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I have a lady friend who is taking Dr. Pierce's Favorite\r\nPrescription now, and last summer every one thought she was going with\r\nconsumption; four of her father's family had died with it in five years:\r\nshe has taken one bottle of \"Favorite Prescription,\" and now she is\r\nbetter in health than she has been in three years. Her address is Mrs.\r\nLaura Paugh, Burden, Cowley Co., Kas.

And for three years previous to treatment, I\r\nhad been a great sufferer from prolapsus. Owing to a more serious injury\r\nthan prolapsus, received at childbirth, my physicians told me that \"I\r\ncould never hope for recovery.\"\r\n\r\nAfter delivery, I kept my bed for seven weeks. At the expiration of that\r\ntime I tried to walk. I found that I could not even stand straight;\r\nthere seemed to be a \"tight cord\" or \"drawing\" from my left side\r\nextending down into my groin, accompanied by great soreness.\r\n\r\nAfter repeated attempts, with my body inclined to that side and yielding\r\nto the drawing, I finally succeeded in walking--a violent trembling all\r\nthe while in the parts affected.\r\n\r\nThree months after the birth of my baby, I tried to take hold of my\r\nhousehold duties--then my troubles increased, and with them came a\r\nseries of \"Doctors' bills.\"\r\n\r\nI consulted two of the best physicians, besides trying all the medicines\r\nI heard tell of, that were recommended for such diseases; but failed in\r\nobtaining a cure from any of them; my relief was only temporary. My\r\ncondition was growing worse each day; the womb was so low and the\r\n\"bearing down\" weight so great that I could scarcely stand on my feet at\r\nall. I was irritable and nervous with a dull headache and constipation;\r\nhands and feet cold and clammy, except the palms and soles; a burning on\r\ntop of my head. At this stage of my disease my bladder was badly\r\naffected--the \"neck\" becoming enlarged and the water collecting there\r\ncaused a protrusion to over half the size of a tea cup, leaving it so\r\ndry and harsh, that it was with the greatest difficulty I could walk at\r\nall; a sudden jar, sneeze, or even the slightest pressure, would force\r\nthe water out, leaving me in a spasm of pain. At this stage (22 months\r\nafter confinement) menstruation returned for the first time since the\r\nbirth of my baby. I had already suffered as much as I thought it\r\npossible to bear, and live, but my sufferings were even greater after\r\nthis; my womb was ulcerated and inflamed; nervousness increased to\r\nviolent shaking, over which I had no control; circulation so feeble that\r\nthe extremities were scarcely supplied with blood, they were constantly\r\ncold and clammy. My sleep broken and disturbed, life was fast becoming a\r\nburden to me, For months, however, I endured this torture; I had\r\nabandoned work altogether; I could be up but a few moments at a time and\r\ncould not walk across the floor without excruciating pain. There was no\r\nsleep, no rest, and after a week and even more, would pass during which\r\nI would never close my eyes in sleep, even when morphine, opium and\r\nchloral, were administered. My body seemed a dead weight, while my mind\r\nwas alive to all my sufferings. There seemed to be a burning pressure\r\nabout my head all the while.\r\n\r\nI would have shaking spells frequently, leaving me perfectly exhausted,\r\nmy heart the while beating so rapidly, I could not count the pulsations;\r\nit seemed to cease altogether after that, with a sinking, fainting\r\nfeeling over me, making it difficult to breathe at all. During my\r\nmenstrual periods I suffered a \"thousand deaths.\" My appetite was gone,\r\nmind and sight impaired, strength and flesh all gone. I was a pitiable\r\nobject to look at, divested of all that made life endurable for me. I\r\nhad baffled the skill of two physicians, and was left, after three years\r\nof agony, to die, a \"hopeless wreck,\" worse than death.\r\n\r\nSuch was my condition when I applied to you for treatment. After using\r\nmedicines only six days I began to improve; my nerves were steadier;\r\ncirculation better, hands and feet warm. Nine days after taking your\r\nmedicines they restored the function again. I will confess I expected to\r\nsuffer death again--I did not think the medicines had had time to effect\r\na change within so short a time. Imagine my joy and surprise upon waking\r\nnext morning to find it had \"stolen like a thief upon me in the night,\"\r\nI knew not when. I spent the day in grateful tears--how could I help it?\r\nIt passed off as quietly as it came, leaving my head clear of that\r\n_dreadful, burning pressure_! My nerves were steady; indeed, my\r\nimprovement was so remarkable, that it seemed almost a delusion. My\r\nappetite had returned, and I was hungry for the first time in over a\r\nyear. I slept well--awoke refreshed and feeling stronger. After two\r\nweeks, I was able to walk around the house and yard without support; a\r\nday or two after that I walked a hundred yards, visiting and spent the\r\nday. In three weeks time I went home (I had gone to my mother's before\r\ntreatment, as I and many others thought, to die).\r\n\r\nAt the end of one month there was no symptom, nor sign, of the old\r\ndisease. I was able to be up all day, resting a short time at noon. To\r\nbe sure of permanent results I continued treatment for one month longer,\r\nand have never had a return of the disease nor any symptom of it since.\r\nBefore the end of the second month, I was able to be about the house,\r\nhelping the children with the cooking, and milking. My weight increased\r\nfourteen pounds in five months after treatment. I have taken no medicine\r\nsince except one bottle of Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription, four\r\nyears ago. At this time (nine years after treatment), I find my health\r\nstill good, having no aches nor pains, a splendid appetite, sleep well,\r\nno headache, no backache and no womb trouble. I am able to do my house\r\nwork and everything; can do a day's work with less fatigue than I have\r\nfor years before treatment. I feel sure that I would have been in the\r\ngrave years ago if it had not been for your medicines. I advise all\r\nother ladies who are troubled with the same disease to apply to you for\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nBe assured, that whenever I have it in my power I shall recommend your\r\ninvaluable remedies. I thank you a thousand times for what you have done\r\nfor me, and for the kindness which you have extended to me throughout.\r\n\r\nWishing you long life and continued success, I am, with much gratitude,\r\n\r\n    Very truly yours, Mrs. JENNIE S. MOODY,\r\n    Isney, Choctaw Co., Ala.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPLICATED CASE OF WOMB DISEASE.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mrs. Knappenberger.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--When I went to the Invalids' Hotel for treatment I was in a\r\nvery critical condition. I could scarcely walk for inward troubles--but\r\nI cannot stop to speak of one disease, for I had such a complication of\r\ndiseases. Now I am doing my own housework and in the past four weeks I\r\nhave entertained forty-seven people, and I think I certainly am doing\r\nwell. It is with the greatest pleasure that I recommend all who are\r\nafflicted to go to the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute. The\r\nSurgeons are honorable, trustworthy gentlemen, who will do all they\r\npromise; and, being men of large experience, they know just what course\r\nof treatment to pursue from first to last, so that an invalid can rest\r\nassured that no experimenting will be done.\r\n\r\nFor seventeen years I was an invalid and never had better health than at\r\nthe present day, for which I am grateful to your Institute.\r\n\r\n    Yours respectfully,\r\n    Mrs. D.T. KNAPPENBERGER,\r\n    Jeannette, Westmoreland Co., Pa.\r\n\r\n\r\nUTERINE DISEASE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mrs. Reel and Daughters.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--For eight years I was a sufferer from female derangements.\r\nI have been permanently cured by your specialist, and with only thirty\r\ndays' treatment. I am happy to say there is no return of the old\r\ntrouble, and all my friends were so surprised to see me so well after\r\nbeing an invalid so long. I shall never regret the day I went to the\r\nInvalids' Hotel. You ought to see me now--I am so healthy, I shall never\r\nforget your kind treatment of me, and the nurses too were so kind and\r\nattentive--I cannot say too much in their praise.\r\n\r\n    Respectfully,\r\n    MRS.

I was at that time suffering from profuse and\r\npainful menstruation, complicated with obstinate constipation, from\r\nwhich I had suffered many years. I cannot speak too highly of your\r\ntreatment of my case, as it was both prompt and thorough and resulted in\r\na radical cure of the above named diseases, and I desire to recommend\r\nall who are thus afflicted to apply to your eminent staff of physicians\r\nfor relief, as they cure when others fail. My advice to all who are\r\nafflicted is, if you wish to get well, go where they make such diseases\r\na specialty. I hope that many others may be as thoroughly cured as I\r\nhave been.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly,\r\n    Miss ELLA DORAN,\r\n    Tiffin, Seneca Co., O.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPLICATION OF DISEASES CURED BY SPECIAL HOME-TREATMENT.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mrs. Sheen.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--I suffered from female complaint; my kidneys, stomach and\r\nnerves were also affected. My physician told me I had Bright's Disease\r\nof the Kidneys. I suffered a great deal in various ways, at times. I\r\nfelt as if life were a burden to me; about that time Dr. Pierce's Common\r\nSense Medical Adviser came into my possession. I read it carefully, and\r\nI thought if Dr. Pierce can not cure me perhaps he can give me some\r\nrelief. I wrote to him, describing my symptoms and feelings as well as I\r\ncould, and asked him if he could cure me. He said he thought he could,\r\nbut it would take a long time for my disease was deep seated. He sent me\r\na box of medicines enough to last one month, especially prepared for my\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nI continued taking his medicines for about thirteen months, and at the\r\nend of that time I felt like a new woman; that has been almost seven\r\nyears now and my health is still good.\r\n\r\nThe benefits derived from Dr. Pierce's Medicines are lasting, and I\r\nadvise all women suffering as I did, to give his medicines a fair trial.\r\n\r\n    Gratefully yours,\r\n    MRS. MARY SHEEN, Council Bluffs, Iowa.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARALYSIS AND UTERINE DISEASE.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mrs. Mann.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--I will say that your Institute is all that you claim for\r\nit, and more to. The Doctors are courteous gentlemen and the best\r\nPhysicians I have ever met with in my life. My treatment while at the\r\nInstitute did me more good in one month than all the doctors everywhere\r\nelse combined. My ailment was Paralysis and Female Weakness. Your\r\ntreatment did me good while at the Institute, and I have also been\r\ngreatly benefited by the home-treatment I have received from you since.\r\nI am much better than I was; I am able to do considerable work now. When\r\nI came to you I could not do anything.\r\n\r\nI herewith send you my heartfelt thanks for all you have done for me,\r\nand should I need more treatment I will write you as before. I would\r\nadvise all people who have chronic diseases to go to the Invalids' Hotel\r\nand Surgical Institute for help, for it is a grand place and prices are\r\nreasonable. We use your Family Medicines--your \"Pellets\" and \"Golden\r\nMedical Discovery\"--and find they are all you claim for them.\r\n\r\nAgain I thank you and remain, your friend,\r\n\r\n    MRS. S.B.

This picture shows my\r\nhusband, myself and our eldest child.\r\n\r\nI pray for your continued success, and thank you for your skill.\r\n\r\n    Very truly yours,\r\n    MRS. A.H.

I was\r\nalso troubled with frequent attacks of nervous headache which rendered\r\nme very miserable.\r\n\r\nA line of treatment was outlined by your specialist, which I followed\r\nclosely, and I immediately began to improve under the use of the\r\nmedicine advised. The benefits were so marked that within two or three\r\nmonths I was able to discontinue the use of the medicine, and have since\r\nthat time been enjoying good health. I attribute my cure to the use of\r\nyour medicines, and I heartily thank you for the benefits received, as\r\nwell as for the kind attention given me by your specialist.\r\n\r\n    Respectfully yours,\r\n    IDA M.

In June, 1890, I\r\ntook typhoid fever of malignant type; for two months I hovered between\r\nlife and death; at length the fever left me in a prostrated condition.\r\nThen I was taken with a severe pain in my back and general nervous\r\nprostration; could not move myself in bed nor bear to be moved by the\r\nmost careful nurses without experiencing excruciating pain. I had the\r\nbest medical attention in the community, but they failed to give relief.\r\nMy friends wrote to Dr. Pierce, stating my condition and requesting\r\ntreatment for me. He treated me for two months; by that time I had so\r\nmuch improved that I did not think it worth while to continue the\r\ntreatment longer, and my health has been such that I have not had\r\noccasion to lie in bed two days together since. I feel under lasting\r\nobligations to Dr. Pierce, and thank God for blessing the world with so\r\nable a physician.\r\n\r\n    Very respectfully.\r\n    MISS MAGNOLIA MORRISON,\r\n    Abernethy, Iredell Co.

Physicians afforded me only temporary\r\nrelief. It was not until I commenced doctoring with Dr. R.V. Pierce that\r\nI experienced any decided benefit. My health has gradually improved\r\nuntil now I feel like a new being.

I placed myself under the treatment of\r\nfour different physicians. At last, giving up all hope of recovery at\r\nhome, I was making arrangements to go to a Sanitarium in Michigan for\r\nspecial treatment. One of your small books with blank enclosed was\r\nhanded to me; I filled out the blank, and thought I would try rather\r\nthan leave home and little ones,--\"Happy decision;\" two months' special\r\ntreatment and I was well and happy, and to-day, I have the very best of\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\n    Yours respectfully,\r\n    MRS.

DROPSY AND OTHER COMPLICATIONS.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mrs. Smith.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--I am a farmer's wife. My husband hired hands to work on his\r\nfarm--I had them to cook for--to wait upon, and my family to care for. I\r\nworked very hard till my health and strength gave way. Six years ago the\r\n\"turn-of-life\" began in the worst form with other disease which I knew\r\nnot; I had a severe misery in my back, pain in my head; the monthly flow\r\nbecame so excessive--came on too often; lasted eleven days. When the\r\nflow would stop then there would be yellow discharge of thick mattery\r\nappearance. I had bearing down in the lower portion of the womb--great\r\npain all through my body: the pain in my womb was more like \"labor-pain\"\r\nthan anything I can compare it to; I had palpitation of the heart, light\r\nchills, hay fever; had pain in my stomach like colic. My womb was very\r\nlow down; the mouth was a large hard knot--was so sore I was compelled\r\nto have a soft seat to sit on; severe pains in my thighs; pain down the\r\nsides of the abdomen; pain in my breast, pain between my shoulders; my\r\nbowels costive; my nervous system prostrated; my digestion impaired; I\r\nhad a desire to urinate all the time, could not pass only a few drops at\r\na time; on standing a few hours, it would form a crust on the\r\nchamber--red, grainy substance; I was bloated all over my body. My feet\r\nand legs were swelled tight, and I was in so much pain day and night I\r\ncould not sleep; I could not eat any food only a little sweet milk and a\r\nlittle corn-bread; I lived in this way for four years; I could not walk\r\nacross the room. I was treated by four of the best doctors in the land;\r\nthe first three gave me no relief--the fourth built up my health to some\r\nextent; none of them could cure me--none of the four could regulate the\r\nmenstrual flow, they could not cure those offensive discharges. I was\r\ngiven up to die by all four of them; my family and friends expected\r\nevery day I would die.\r\n\r\nI got one of your Memorandum Books; I read it carefully, and I was\r\nhoping all this time for some relief--I hoped all the time for relief.\r\nMy husband decided to write to you--ask your advice, believing you could\r\ngive me relief; though I felt ashamed to tell a gentleman, a doctor I\r\nnever saw, those things concerning my afflictions; but I was suffering\r\nterribly. I hoped for relief and I found it. I am happy to tell you I am\r\nwell. I was spared to be cured by your good advice and good medicine and\r\nto spread your fame.\r\n\r\nWhen I received the book you sent me and a letter telling me what to\r\ntake, and what it would do for me, I was very feeble; I had just got up\r\nfrom one of those bad spells--so weak that I could not sit up for more\r\nthan an hour at a time. My husband went and got the medicine and a\r\nsyringe. I began its use, as you advised, and took the medicine as you\r\ndirected; I have taken your medicine seven months; the first month my\r\nimprovement was slow; I began to have strength; my pain began to banish;\r\nmy appetite began to come; I commenced to sleep sound and the bloating\r\nbegan to go down; the pain in my head was gone; palpitation of the\r\nheart, also the misery in my back disappeared; the pain in my womb began\r\nto banish; the first time the monthly flow appeared, it was\r\ncontrolled--it was regulated--it went so light with me that I could go\r\nall the time without a cane. I have not had one spell to confine me to\r\nbed in seven months; I have done all the cooking for my family all the\r\nyear; the pain in my stomach disappeared; the yellow discharge also--the\r\nbearing down banished. I have no pain, no aches, no bad feelings. I feel\r\nbetter to day, than I have in ten years. I now enjoy life, enjoy my\r\nfamily, enjoy my friends. I enjoy the pleasure of telling my friends who\r\ncured me, and what medicine it was that cured me; he should have the\r\nhonor. It is Dr. Pierce!\r\n\r\nI was at death's door when I began to take his medicine, and followed\r\nhis advice. It was his \"Favorite Prescription,\" \"Golden Medical\r\nDiscovery\" and the \"Pleasant Pellets\" that cured me.

I began taking\r\nDr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription, \"Golden Medical Discovery\" and his\r\n\"Pellets,\" and was greatly benefited; took half a dozen bottles at that\r\ntime, did not take any more for several years, when I began to go down\r\nagain. I was married November, 1889. The next September had a\r\nmiscarriage. The summer following my health was very bad; I then got one\r\ndozen bottles and took as directed.

I\r\ncannot express what I suffered. I had eight doctors and all the medicine\r\nI had from them failed--the one after the other.\r\n\r\nI was nervous, cold hands, feet, palpitation, headache, backache,\r\nconstipation, leucorrhoea and no appetite, with bearing down pains. I\r\ngot so weak I could not walk around. I had to keep my bed, thinking I\r\nwould never get any better.\r\n\r\nOne day my husband got one of your little books and read it to me. He\r\nsaid there was nothing doing me any good. I said I would try Dr.\r\nPierce's Favorite Prescription. I did try it. After the first few weeks\r\nmy appetite was better; I was able to sit up in bed. I wrote to the\r\nWorld's Dispensary Medical Association, at Buffalo, N.Y., and described\r\nmy case; they sent me a book on woman's diseases. I read carefully and\r\nfollowed the directions as near as I could, and took the medicine for\r\ntwo years, With the blessing of God and your medicines I am entirely\r\ncured. That was three years ago:\r\n\r\n    Yours most respectfully,\r\n    MRS. ALEX.

Soon after I discovered that\r\nI was a sufferer from a very painful condition of the vagina and from\r\nirregular menstruation. In fact the latter was true from its first\r\nappearance. I consulted our family physician but he gave me no relief.\r\nAt last I applied to Dr. Pierce for aid: he advised me to take his\r\n\"Favorite Prescription,\" which I did faithfully. I bought seven bottles\r\nof it and one of the \"Golden Medical Discovery.\" After I had taken two\r\nbottles of the \"Favorite Prescription,\" my menses began to be more\r\nregular and I was also relieved of the other diseases. Before I began\r\ntaking the medicine, I felt great lassitude and weakness at times, but I\r\nnow feel quite strong.\r\n\r\nI can confidently recommend Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription to any\r\none suffering as I did.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly,\r\n    MRS.

We called our family\r\nphysician, and he said I had consumption. All our neighbors thought so\r\ntoo. I had pains through my chest and spit up blood. I commenced with\r\nyour \"Golden Medical Discovery\" and had only taken it two or three days\r\nwhen I felt like a different person. I took four bottles of the medicine\r\nand it cured my cough. Have not been bothered since, until a short time\r\nago I took cold and commenced to cough again; I got a bottle of the\r\n\"Discovery\" and it relieved me at once. I think it is the best medicine\r\nin the world. It saved my life. I don't think any one would die of\r\nconsumption if they would take Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery. I\r\nrecommend it to all my friends, and tell them what it did for me.

My condition was pitiful before I was\r\npersuaded to use it. I had leucorrhea, no appetite, cold feet, weakness,\r\nfainting spells, melancholy. I felt that I would soon leave my children\r\nmotherless. I fell off in flesh to a pitiful looking object. My friends\r\naround said I must be consumptive. My family doctor gave me nearly all\r\nkinds of blood medicine for over a year--all kinds of tonics to build up\r\nflesh, but nothing seemed to benefit me.\r\n\r\nLast September--one year ago, I began using Dr. Pierce's Favorite\r\nPrescription, being convinced that my disease was female weakness. I had\r\nonly used it three days when I began to feel better and, after using\r\nthree bottles accompanied by the \"Discovery,\" I felt as though I was\r\nwell, and continued its use until I had used half a dozen bottles for\r\nfear of a relapse.\r\n\r\nWas a living picture of surprise to my friends. They had all expected my\r\ndeath. I have given birth two months ago to a baby and no return of my\r\nold disease. I hope that all females, dragging about with pain and\r\nweakness, dyspepsia, melancholy feelings, restlessness at night, and not\r\nfeeling like getting up in the morning, may commence the use of Dr.\r\nPierce's Favorite Prescription, and be well again.

It affected my back,\r\nhips, and legs, and made me miserable indeed. My stomach was very bad;\r\nit soured and burned after eating. My heart, also, gave me much distress\r\nby beating so fast and loud at times.\r\n\r\nIn May I commenced using Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription; took seven\r\nbottles of that, and then, by your advice, began taking Dr. Pierce's\r\nGolden Medical Discovery.

I went there and gave it five drops of Dr. Pierce's\r\nExtract of Smart-Weed, and increased the dose every time its bowels\r\nmoved, until I got to a half teaspoonful. The next morning the child was\r\nalmost well. That woman says I saved her baby's life.\r\n\r\nI could write a week and not tell half the good your medicines have done\r\nthrough my hands. Two weeks ago, a young man at my house was taken with\r\n_cholera morbus_.

Freer in New Albion, N.Y., which did so much for her that\r\nafter I was married I used them in my own family. Two different times I\r\nhave used the \"Discovery\" when physicians told me they could only patch\r\nme up--I was so bad and getting steadily worse. I sat down and wrote to\r\nyou; even after the letter was written I felt so worthless it seemed\r\nfoolish to try, so kept my letter for some time thinking it better not\r\nto trouble you with it, but finally mailed it little thinking your\r\nadvice and the \"Discovery\" could so speedily restore me to my usual\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\nA near neighbor used it for a cough occasioned by a sudden cold, and\r\nless than one bottle stopped the cough. We use the \"Pellets\" for malaria\r\nand the numberless ills and epidemics that go the rounds, always with\r\nhappy results; it saves us physicians' bills and much suffering. We\r\nconsult your Common Sense Medical Adviser as our family physician. It\r\nsaves much anxiety and fruitless journeyings after a physician, perhaps\r\nto find them gone or unwilling to breast the storm or heat, to say\r\nnothing of the delay and danger of being too late.\r\n\r\nBoth my sister and myself have used your \"Favorite Prescription\" and\r\nknow it to be what it is represented by you to be.

I was in such misery that many times, as I lay down for the\r\nnight, have I prayed that I might never see the rising of another sun.\r\nIt was almost death to me to stand on my feet.\r\n\r\nWhen I began using your medicines, I weighed 103 pounds.

I suffered\r\nall the time with a weight in the bottom of my stomach, and the most\r\nsevere bearing-down pains, low down, across me, with every step I\r\nattempted to take. I also suffered intense pain in my back and right\r\nhip. At times I could not turn myself in bed. My complexion was yellow,\r\nmy eyes blood-shot, and my whole system was a complete wreck. I suffered\r\ngreatly from headaches, and the thought of food would sicken me. Now I\r\ncan eat anything, and at any time. My friends are all surprised at the\r\ngreat change in me. Every one thought I would not live through the month\r\nof August. Two of my neighbors are using your medicines, and say they\r\nfeel like new beings.\r\n\r\n    Truly yours,\r\n    MRS.

I had many physicians before\r\nbut got no relief until I began to take Dr. Pierce's Favorite\r\nPrescription and his \"Golden Medical Discovery.\" I then commenced to get\r\nbetter right away.

For two years I could do no\r\nwork. I had five different physicians, who pronounced my case a poor or\r\nimpoverished condition of the blood, and uterine trouble. I suffered a\r\ngreat deal with pain in both sides, and much tenderness on pressing over\r\nthe womb. I bloated at times in my bowels and limbs. Was troubled with\r\nleucorrhea. I could not sleep, and was troubled with palpitation of the\r\nheart. Suffered a great deal of pain in my head, temples, forehead and\r\neyes. I had a troublesome cough, and raised a great deal, and at times\r\nexperienced a good deal of pain in my chest and lungs. My voice at times\r\nwas very weak. I suffered excruciating monthly, periodical pains. Since\r\ntaking seven bottles of your \"Favorite Prescription\" some time ago, I\r\nhave enjoyed better health than I have for more than four years\r\npreviously; in fact, for several months past I have been able to work at\r\nsewing. I have gained in weight thirty-nine pounds since taking your\r\nmedicines; the soreness and pain, of which I formerly complained so\r\nmuch, have disappeared.

She has no bearing-down\r\npains since she began the use of your remedies. She does nearly all of\r\nher own housework now, but before she commenced taking your remedies,\r\nshe could hardly walk across the room.\r\n\r\nI do not know now to thank you for all the good your remedies have done\r\nher, for the best doctors had given her case up as incurable.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly,\r\n    ALFRED LEWIS,\r\n    Fairport Harbor, Lake Co., Ohio.\r\n\r\n\r\nUTERINE DEBILITY.\r\n\r\nPERMANENTLY CARED, AFTER TAKING FIVE BOTTLES OF \"PRESCRIPTION.\"\r\n\r\n_Dep't of Photography, U.S. Artillery School_, Fortress Monroe, Va.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mrs. Sargent.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--My wife cannot speak too highly of your Dr. Pierce's\r\nFavorite Prescription, it having completely cured her of a serious womb\r\ntrouble of long standing.

I can conscientiously recommend your medicines to any\r\nsuffering woman. I think they are indeed the best medicines for \"female\r\ncomplaint\" that has ever been invented. Had it not been for them I\r\nsurely would have died.\r\n\r\nI tried numbers of remedies from doctors but without getting any relief;\r\nI then took Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery and his \"Favorite\r\nPrescription\" and I feel confident that I am permanently cured.\r\n\r\nI told my mother to try it; she has taken four bottles--two of the\r\n\"Golden Medical Discovery\" and two of the \"Prescription.\" She says it is\r\nthe best medicine she has ever tried for her case; she is in better\r\nhealth than she has been for fifteen years.

I did not get\r\nany better under that treatment so I thought I would try Dr. Pierce's\r\nFavorite Prescription and \"Golden Medical Discovery.\" I felt better\r\nbefore I used one bottle of each. I continued their use until I took six\r\nbottles of each. In three months' time I felt so well I did not think it\r\nnecessary to take any more. In childbirth it does what Dr. Pierce\r\nrecommends it to do. I would like to recommend Dr. Pierce's Extract of\r\nSmart-weed to those who have never tried it; it surely is the best thing\r\nfor cholera morbus, or pain in the stomach I ever used; it WORKS like a\r\ncharm.

I cannot describe the constant\r\npain and torment to which I was subjected every moment of my life, and I\r\nwas so reduced in flesh and strength that I could scarcely walk across\r\nthe floor and had little hope of ever being any better.\r\n\r\nI was induced, by the advice of a friend, to take your \"Favorite\r\nPrescription,\" as she had been cured after taking several bottles of it.\r\nMy physicians said I was suffering from the effects of \"change of life,\"\r\norganic heart disease and womb trouble.\r\n\r\nI sent for your Common Sense Medical Adviser and then wrote to you. You\r\nadvised me to take six bottles more of the \"Favorite Prescription,\"\r\nwhich I did, and in a reasonable length of time after taking it, I felt\r\nvery grateful for the happy relief I obtained. I do not suffer near so\r\nmuch with my heart as I did before taking the \"Favorite Prescription.\" I\r\nhad not been able to do any kind of work at all for two years, and I am\r\nnow able to attend to my household duties without suffering any pain.\r\n\r\nI have two daughters--17 and 19 years old, that have been in very bad\r\nhealth for twelve months or more. I gave them each several bottles of\r\nthe \"Favorite Prescription,\" and it entirely cured them.\r\n\r\nI would send you my photo., as you request, but have none, and there is\r\nno place nearer than Natchez, Miss., thirty miles distant, where I could\r\nhave one taken.\r\n\r\nI now thank you most kindly for the happy relief and cure which myself\r\nand daughters received from taking your \"Favorite Prescription.\"\r\n\r\nWith many thanks and wishing you success, I am.\r\n\r\n    Yours respectfully,\r\n    Mrs N.E.

In the Spring\r\nof 1890 I became so exhausted that I was compelled to keep to my bed\r\nwith symptoms of paralysis in the lower limbs, and many other\r\ndistressing symptoms. I accidentally obtained one of Dr. Pierce's\r\nMedical Advisers from a friend, and finding my ailments so well\r\ndescribed therein, I wrote to Dr. Pierce for his advice, which he sent\r\nby return mail. For my recovery he requested me to use his \"Golden\r\nMedical Discovery,\" his \"Favorite Prescription,\" and his \"Pleasant\r\nPellets.\" He also gave me some directions for every-day living. These\r\nmeans accomplished my complete cure. I am thankful that we can have such\r\nreliable medicines brought into our homes without great expense.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly,\r\n    MRS. AMERICA NAY,\r\n    Volga, Jefferson Co., Ind.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHICK NECK (GOITRE),\r\n\r\nNERVOUS DEBILITY AND WEAKNESS CURED.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Miss Houghton.]\r\n\r\nMISS ELLA A. HOUGHTON, of _Theresa, Jefferson Co., N.Y._, was cured of\r\nThick Neck, Nervous Prostration, Weakness and a complication of ailments\r\nby Dr. Pierce's \"Discovery\" and \"Favorite Prescription.\" She says: \"My\r\nhealth is now as good as it was before I was sick. The swelling (goitre)\r\nhas all gone from my neck. I don't have any bad feelings. My gratitude\r\nfor the benefit I have received from your treatment has induced me to\r\nrecommend you to all whom I know to be sick.\" \"I have known of two or\r\nthree middle aged ladies residing near here, who have been cured by your\r\n'Favorite Prescription.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPPRESSED MENSTRUATION.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--It is almost two years ago that my little girl was taken\r\nwith a spasm which frightened me so that my menses became suppressed. I\r\nsuffered severely with pressure on the brain so that I often thought I\r\nshould go insane. I also had severe pain in the ovaries, and bearing\r\ndown pain. I consulted a physician, who treated me for awhile till I\r\nbegan to feel worse, and consulted another physician whom I knew had\r\ntreated several women for like ailments. He gave me medicine which did\r\nme no more good than that prescribed by the first physician.\r\n\r\nFinally, after an examination, the doctor said that he should have to\r\noperate on me in order to have my health restored.\r\n\r\nAs my husband and I had heard and read so much about Dr. Pierce's\r\nmedicines we decided to try them. We had Dr. Pierce's Common Sense\r\nMedical Adviser. I took three or four bottles of Dr. Pierce's Favorite\r\nPrescription and one bottle of \"Golden Medical Discovery\" and one vial\r\nof \"Pellets.\" After using these I felt perfectly cured. As I am always\r\ntroubled more or less with biliousness, I keep your little \"Pellets\" on\r\nhand and find relief by using them. One of them taken after meals acts\r\nsplendidly for indigestion.\r\n\r\n    Respectfully, MRS. B.H.

Adams said could never be cured).\r\n\r\nI do hope that by so doing some little one may escape the misery my\r\nlittle one suffered for over a year until I began the use of the \"Golden\r\nMedical Discovery.\" I followed your directions found in the little book\r\naround the bottles. Before the first bottle was gone, he could eat and\r\nsleep without that coughing and choking that, before the use of the\r\n\"Discovery,\" was impossible.\r\n\r\nThe tumor began to lessen in size, and after the third bottle I would\r\nnever have known he ever had a tumor there. He is now hearty and\r\nhealthy. Sleeps as good as any child and is full of life. He does not\r\ntake anything to prevent a return, and has not for over a year.\r\n\r\nI have one of your Common Sense Medical Advisers, and found it worth\r\nfive times what I gave for it; I have helped others to get it and the\r\n\"Medical Discovery\" and \"Favorite Prescription\" have brought relief to\r\nmany through me. I use the \"Prescription\" off and on; it has given me\r\nstrength; I think I should have been an invalid long ago without it.\r\n\r\nEvery one here knows the truth of this letter, and I would tell it to\r\nthe world if I could.\r\n\r\n    Respectfully,\r\n    MRS.

Of course at first I paid but little attention to it, hoping it\r\nwould amount to nothing and probably wear away. But I slowly but surely\r\ngrew worse, and at last resolved to apply to the doctors for help. My\r\nwater came often, and in small quantities, and with great pain, and with\r\nred brick-dust deposit. I was attacked with severe womb trouble, bloody\r\npiles and dropsy of the ovary. I was treated by five different doctors.\r\nI was compelled to wear an inside support for a year, but it still\r\nseemed impossible for me to get well and I began to feel exceedingly\r\nalarmed and very uneasy, not knowing what course to pursue, or what the\r\nconsequences might be. I had heard of Dr. Pierce, and concluded to make\r\none more trial, so I sat down and wrote a letter to him, stating matters\r\nas near as I could, and in due time I received a favorable reply; then I\r\ncommenced with his medicine. I commenced somewhere in February 1891 with\r\nthe \"Golden Medical Discovery\" and \"Favorite Prescription,\" in alternate\r\ndoses. A strange occurrence followed. My limbs felt like what we call\r\n\"asleep,\" and I felt as if I were in a strange land and wondered what\r\nwas going to take place. I kept on till I took nine bottles. The first\r\nrelief I felt was from sick headache, which I had been troubled with for\r\nmany years; I was also cured of a very bad cough which I had been\r\ntroubled with for many years, and of dyspepsia of long standing. I was\r\nentirely cured of a very singular and severe itching on my back, between\r\nmy shoulders, which our doctors called winter itch and which they\r\npronounced incurable. I had suffered with this for twenty years; it\r\nwould come in the winter and go away in the summer. I was also cured of\r\nthe worst form of bloody piles and of womb disease. At present I feel\r\nlike a new person.\r\n\r\nWhen I first commenced with Dr. Pierce's medicines, I could not walk\r\nhalf a mile without a pain. The other day I walked to Mercersburgh\r\npost-office, a distance of twelve miles, and the next day walked back\r\nagain, and felt no bad results from the journey. I am now 51 years old.\r\n\r\nMrs. Knavel further writes, that \"To any person desiring to know more\r\nconcerning my case and its wonderful cure, and who will enclose to me a\r\nreturn self-addressed and stamped envelope for reply, I will be pleased\r\nto write further information.\"\r\n\r\n    Yours respectfully,\r\n    SARAH A.

I was advised by a\r\nfriend to take the \"Favorite Prescription,\" which I did, and found, in\r\ntaking six bottles of the \"Prescription\" and two of the \"Discovery,\"\r\nthat it has effected a positive cure, for which words cannot express my\r\ngratitude for the relief from the great suffering that I so long\r\nendured.\r\n\r\n    Respectfully,\r\n    MRS.

I took\r\nseven bottles in all of the two medicines; they did me a world of good;\r\nI do not think I should have been here to-day were it not for your\r\nmedicines.\r\n\r\nI would send you my photograph, but I have none, and live sixty miles\r\nfrom a photographer.\r\n\r\n    Gratefully yours,\r\n    Mr. Thomas Prewett\r\n\r\n\r\nTUMOR OF BREAST AND WOMB DISEASE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MRS.

Pierce,\r\nChief Consulting Physician, at the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical\r\nInstitute at Buffalo, N.Y., as follows: \"It is my heart's desire to\r\nwrite to you of what your medicines have done for me. I was in a very\r\nbad state when I wrote to you, and you prescribed for me and I took your\r\nmedicines according to directions and am a well woman again. I had\r\nuterine disease and tumor in the breast. The doctors said they could do\r\nnothing for me any more and must resort to the knife. I would not\r\nconsent and so wrote to you, and followed your advice. I took two dozen\r\nbottles of your 'Favorite Prescription,' seven bottles of your 'Golden\r\nMedical Discovery' and my health is now better than it had been in\r\ntwenty years; my neighbors said I could not live three months, and I\r\nknow that your treatment and medicine cured.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nULCERATION OF WOMB.

I was afflicted for more\r\nthan five years with falling of the womb and ulceration of the same,\r\nconnected with very painful and irregular menstruation with chills\r\nduring the same. Rush of blood to the head, sometimes falling down in\r\ninsensibility and remaining so for several hours; and part of the time\r\ncould not bear my weight on my limbs to stand up or walk at all for\r\nseveral days at a time. I was a burden to myself when I commenced taking\r\nDr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription and \"Golden Medical Discovery,\" and\r\nhis \"Pleasant Pellets\" and \"Smart-weed;\" I used the glycerine and iodine\r\nas you prescribed for me also. I think I used one dozen bottles of\r\n\"Prescription,\" half a dozen \"Discovery\" one dozen \"Pills,\" one-half\r\ndozen \"Smart-weed,\" at first and some more afterwards, only a few\r\nbottles, I don't remember how many.\r\n\r\nI am now well, doing my own work, and do not suffer any more pain, and\r\ndon't need any more medicine.\r\n\r\n    Respectfully,\r\n    MRS.

PIERCE, Buffalo, N.Y.: Arcadia, Manistee Co., Mich.\r\n\r\n_Dear Sir_--We received your kind letter, with the \"Pellets,\" and are\r\nvery much obliged for the same. We know they are just what you recommend\r\nthem to be. We have used your medicines for about seven years and have\r\ndepended almost entirely on them for five years. Before we began the use\r\nof your medicines, we used to have to employ a doctor every little\r\nwhile; now we do not have to. We have four children. We give them Dr.\r\nPierce's Golden Medical Discovery when they take cold and I think it is\r\nfar better than most cough medicines, for the \"Discovery\" helps the\r\nappetite and the cough medicines make one sick. I like your idea of\r\nkeeping the blood pure and the \"Discovery\" is the medicine for that. I\r\ntake a bottle twice a year, in the spring and fall, and I have\r\nrecommended it to several other ladies who have tried it and they all\r\nthink highly of it. I have bought thirteen bottles of the \"Discovery\"\r\nand three bottles of Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription and nine bottles\r\nof the \"Pellets\" in five years, so you see our doctor-bill has not been\r\nvery large. Our oldest boy hurt himself, lifting, and I depended upon\r\nDr. Pierce's Compound Extract of Smart-weed for external application,\r\nand it cured him. I bought two bottles of that.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly,\r\n    Mrs. S.

It worked like a charm on my\r\nsystem and I am a good deal heavier in flesh now. It is the best\r\nmedicine in the world for \"female troubles,\" for I took almost all kinds\r\nof Patent Medicines, and doctors' prescriptions without benefit. There\r\nis hardly a day passes but that I recommend it to some of my lady\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly,\r\n    Mrs. CORA CUMMINGS,\r\n    No. 74 E.

I was sick for nearly three years. Sometimes I\r\nthought I would go crazy I was so weak, nervous, and down hearted, and\r\nsour in spirits, that I was afraid I would die every day, and such mean\r\nfeelings I could not describe to any one. I remained in this stage for\r\nnearly three years, doctoring with every home doctor and trying every\r\nmedicine that I thought would help me, and I could get no relief. I\r\ncould not sleep at times and had palpitation of the heart so that I\r\nwould have to get up, for my heart would beat so fast I thought every\r\nminute I would die. The misery I went through no one could describe.\r\n\r\nA lady friend handed me Dr. Pierce's Common Sense Medical Adviser, and I\r\nwrote to you about myself, and you told me to take \"Favorite\r\nPrescription\" and \"Golden Medical Discovery.\" I commenced in the spring\r\nand took three bottles of each of your medicines, and I felt so much\r\nbetter I thought that was enough, and ever since I have had my health. I\r\ngrew stronger, and could run and skip about like a child, and was happy\r\nall day long. I felt so well I could hardly believe it was myself. I\r\njust used the two kinds of medicines--\"Golden Medical Discovery\" and\r\n\"Favorite Prescription,\" and followed the \"Common Sense Medical\r\nAdviser,\" took regular baths, and dieted for about a year, and the\r\nresult was a bright baby boy which brightens our home. I took the\r\n\"Favorite Prescription\" before, and the result was a few hours' labor\r\nand got along splendidly; my baby weighed twenty-four pounds at seven\r\nmonths--a brighter, healthier baby than he is there never was.\r\n\r\n    Respectfully yours,\r\n    MRS.

I value Dr. Pierce's\r\nGolden Medical Discovery and his \"Favorite Prescription\" very highly and\r\noften recommend them to others. I do not think I would ever have got\r\nwell if it had not been for your medicines. I was in a sad condition. My\r\nbowels and half of my body (the left side), was nearly paralyzed,\r\nbesides nearly my whole system was out of order. I suffered all the\r\ntime; but after taking six bottles of \"Golden Medical Discovery\" and the\r\nsame of \"Favorite Prescription,\" and using two bottles of Sage's Catarrh\r\nRemedy as an injection, I felt like a new person. I have never seen\r\nanyone suffering in the same way as I did. If anyone with female trouble\r\nof any kind will use your medicines I am satisfied they will help them.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly,\r\n    Mary A.

I was under the doctor's care for three months with womb\r\ndisease and a gradual wasting all the time. I was so weak that I could\r\nnot be raised in bed when I commenced taking the \"Prescription,\" and by\r\nthe time I had taken three bottles I was up and going wherever I\r\npleased, and have had good health and been very strong ever since. That\r\nwas four years ago. I have recommended it to a good many of my friends,\r\nand they have taken it and are highly pleased.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly,\r\n    G.A.

I return many thanks to you for your kindness. My\r\ncomplaint was pain in my back, and in my side, that moved from the right\r\nside to the left; shortness of breath and pain in the lower part of the\r\nstomach, and my doctor said I had ovaritis and I took two bottles of the\r\n\"Favorite Prescription\" and one bottle of the \"Golden Medical\r\nDiscovery,\" and I am relieved of all pains in the back and sides, and of\r\nwomb complaint.

I suffered\r\nfor years with pain in my back, never a night was I free. At your\r\nrequest I commenced a course of Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription and\r\n\"Golden Medical Discovery.\" I could not sleep on a mattress; it seemed\r\nas though it would kill me. Since taking the medicine I can sleep\r\nanywhere; I am perfectly well. I would not be placed in my former\r\ncondition for any money. I bought six bottles, or $5.00 worth. I took\r\nbut four, my husband took the \"Golden Medical Discovery.\" At this time I\r\nhad a servant girl who suffered badly from pain at the time of her\r\nmonthly periods; she took the other bottle of \"Favorite Prescription,\"\r\nwhich was a great help to her.\r\n\r\n    Gratefully yours,\r\n    Mrs. J.H.

I would have sinking spells. My\r\nnerves were prostrated and I had female weakness and ulceration of the\r\nwomb, which caused such excessive flowing that they thought I would die;\r\nthen I would take sinking spells. My stomach was too weak, the medicine\r\ncould not do its part as it should have done. I had torpid liver and\r\nright side of lungs affected; catarrh of the throat and piles;\r\npalpitation of the heart, and kidneys were somewhat affected. My doctor\r\ngot me up and able to walk through the house, but the flowing would\r\nstill be so bad that I would have to take the bed; then would be able to\r\nbe up again and learn to walk a little again till the time would come\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nMy doctor treated me for the ulcers. A lady came to see me. She told me\r\nto try Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription. I got it but did not tell my\r\ndoctor. He soon remarked the improvement and I then told him what I was\r\nusing; he told me to use it, that it would be good for me. I used eleven\r\nbottles of the \"Favorite Prescription,\" and two of the \"Golden Medical\r\nDiscovery.\" The flowing was not so bad. I got so I could sit up and be\r\nabout at all times, and walk about in the house. I am still improving,\r\nand can do light house work.

I consulted several physicians--no one could clearly diagnose\r\nmy case and their medicine failed to give relief. After much persuasion\r\nI commenced taking Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription--have taken five\r\nbottles and am a well woman doing all my housework; from a run down\r\ncondition I have been restored to health.

I know I never\r\nwould have become pregnant, if I had not got in better health. I feel it\r\nmy duty to do all that I can to praise you and your wonderful \"Favorite\r\nPrescription.\" I can highly recommend it to all females who are\r\nsuffering with leucorrhea, for I don't think any one suffered any worse\r\nthan I did when I made my case known to you.

But I began taking Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical\r\nDiscovery and his \"Favorite Prescription,\" and took five bottles of\r\neach, and used two bottles of your Sage's Catarrh Remedy for vaginal\r\ninjections. It is three years since and I have not had any return of the\r\ntrouble. I feel very grateful, and in fact, owe you my life, for I do\r\nnot think I should have been alive now if I had not taken your remedies.\r\n\r\n    Respectfully,\r\n    Mrs. ABRAM LYON,\r\n    Lorraine, Jefferson County, N.Y.\r\n\r\n\r\nBARRENNESS, DYSPEPSIA, \"LIVER COMPLAINT.\"\r\n\r\nBasin, Cassia Co., Idaho.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--I first had dyspepsia and \"liver complaint\" for five years,\r\nand I took six bottles of Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery and his\r\n\"Pleasant Pellets,\" which Entirely cured me of that complaint. I also\r\nhad painful menstruation, and took about eight bottles of Dr. Pierce's\r\nFavorite Prescription and two bottles of his Compound Extract of\r\nSmart-weed, which cured me. The symptoms of this disease were very\r\nsevere, pain in the region of the womb, back and thighs, Chilliness and\r\nnausea; this disease was so severe that I was barren for two years of\r\nmarried life, and after taking the \"Favorite Prescription,\" I became the\r\nmother of a boy.\r\n\r\n    Yours respectfully,\r\n    Mrs Emma Mcintosh\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL DEBILITY, MALARIA, SICK HEADACHE.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mrs. J.H. Lansing.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--I am happy to say that your valuable medicine has been a\r\ngreat benefit to me. I was suffering from general debility, malaria and\r\nnervous sick headaches, and after my third child was born (a beautiful\r\nbaby boy of ten pounds) I only recovered after a long illness; I barely\r\ngained strength enough in two years' time so that I was able to crawl\r\nabout to accomplish the little housework that I had, by lying down to\r\nread many times each day; had sick headaches very often; and many pains\r\nand aches, all the time complaining of getting no better. I finally\r\nasked my husband to get a bottle of Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription,\r\nwhich he promptly did. After I had taken one bottle I could see a great\r\nchange in my strength, and fewer sick headaches.\r\n\r\nI continued taking the medicine until I had taken eight bottles--seven\r\nof the \"Favorite Prescription\" and one of the \"Golden Medical\r\nDiscovery.\" For some time past I have not used it but I am now able to\r\ndo the housework for myself, husband and two children (aged nine and\r\nfive years). I also take in dressmaking, and enjoy walking a mile at a\r\ntime, and I think it is all due to the medicine, for I know I was only\r\nfailing fast before I commenced to take it. I take great pleasure in\r\nrecommending the \"Favorite Prescription\" to all women who suffer from\r\ndebility and sick headache.\r\n\r\n    Respectfully yours, MRS. J.H.

His medicine did me\r\nno good; but whatever ailed me I was in such misery I could not describe\r\nwhat I suffered. The first thing that gave me any relief was Dr.\r\nPierce's Favorite Prescription. The first half bottle made me feel much\r\nbetter. I used two or three bottles and thought I was cured, but it came\r\nback in three or four months, and as soon as I began to take the\r\nmedicine again I got better. I took two or three bottles again, and\r\nnever felt anything of it since; and that is nearly four years ago, and\r\nI give all thanks to Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription. I use no other\r\nmedicine at all for stomach trouble but Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical\r\nDiscovery. I have been troubled some with rheumatism, when nothing else\r\nwould do any good, \"Golden Medical Discovery\" cured me; I had not taken\r\nmore than one-half bottle when I felt like another woman, and I would\r\nadvise any who has any trouble with his stomach, or who has rheumatism,\r\nto try it as there is not its equal to be found.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly,\r\n    Mrs S.A.

I was a great sufferer for four years. I had\r\ntried two physicians but neither gave me any relief. After taking Dr.\r\nPierce's Favorite Prescription I can't say enough for it.

I had given up to die. Going to\r\nyour Dispensary was a last resort with me; I had undergone a surgical\r\noperation at the hands of my family physician from which I grew worse\r\nevery day for eight months, so that I very despondently started for your\r\ninstitution; and when I had traveled eleven hundred miles I was made\r\nmore despondent by inquiring of a man how far I had to travel to reach\r\nBuffalo, N.Y.: He answered, \"Just one hundred miles.\" I then inquired of\r\nhim if he had ever been in Buffalo, N.Y. He replied, \"Many a time.\" I\r\nthen asked him, what about Dr. Pierce's world-famed Surgical Institute?\r\n\"Oh, it's a humbug. They have some drawings or pictures taken from some\r\ngovernment buildings, that's where they get that fine building you see\r\npictured in their books and pamphlets.\"\r\n\r\nI don't suppose there ever was a sadder heart entered the door of the\r\nInvalids' Hotel than that heart of mine; but it was soon made glad to be\r\nglad ever since. During the first night in the Invalids' Hotel I met and\r\ntalked with patients afflicted as I was. Many of them were cured and\r\ntalking of going home next day, and sure enough, they went; but I never\r\nmissed them in number for others kept coming.\r\n\r\nI can honestly and truthfully say that the World's Dispensary Medical\r\nAssociation of Buffalo, N.Y., is anything else than a humbug. The reason\r\nwhy they are not humbugs is plain. They continue to perform wonderful\r\ncures and treat their patients with unsurpassed nursing, and a kinder\r\nlot of physicians, surgeons and nurses I don't believe can be found in\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nI cheerfully advise all persons suffering from chronic diseases not to\r\nstop to count the distance from where they live to Buffalo, N.Y., but go\r\nstraight to the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute without delay,\r\nfor it is by the will of God and their skill that I am living to-day.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly,\r\n    L.M.

Was suffering from nervousness,\r\nfemale troubles and nasal catarrh; life was almost a burden to me, but a\r\nglorious change came, due solely to Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription\r\nand Dr. Sage's Catarrh Remedy. I have suffered more than tongue can ever\r\ntell. I have been treated by good physicians but they only help me\r\ntemporarily. I have taken a great many patent medicines with the same\r\nresult.

I got a bottle of your \"Favorite Prescription\" and by the time I\r\nhad used half of it, the soreness began to get better. I used three\r\nbottles altogether, and since that, you might say I am enjoying the best\r\nof health most of the time.

I tried\r\nthree doctors and none of them seemed to do me any good. When at last I\r\nalmost despaired of health any more, I saw in a paper one of your\r\nadvertisements, and I sent for and got two bottles of Dr. Pierce's\r\nGolden Medical Discovery, and I improved so rapidly that I sent for and\r\ngot three bottles of your \"Favorite Prescription,\" and now I am as well\r\nas I have been since I was a child.\r\n\r\nI had been a sufferer for three years when I commenced taking Dr.\r\nPierce's medicines. When I commenced taking it, I was not able to walk\r\nacross my room without help, or rise from my chair. I suffered from\r\nnervousness very much, and with the least excitement I would faint; and\r\nI think, in short, I suffered with female irregularities and that your\r\nmedicine has brought me through.

It is one of the evidences that passion,\r\ninstead of prudence, has held sway. Passion may aptly be termed the\r\nvoice of the body, by which, if we listen, we are enchanted and led\r\nastray. Conscience is the voice of the soul, which remonstrates, and if\r\nwe obey, we shall be guided aright. We cannot reconcile these\r\nconflicting voices, and if we indulge the passions when conscience\r\nforbids gratification, the remembrance of the wrong remains forever, and\r\nconstant fear is an everlasting punishment.\r\n\r\nWRECKED MANHOOD. Man possesses few powers which are more highly prized\r\nthan those of virility, which is the very essence of manhood. \"He is but\r\nthe counterfeit of a man, who hath not the life of a man.\"\r\n\r\nTHE SEMEN is a milky fluid of the consistency of mucus. It is secreted\r\nby the testicles and is intermixed with the fluids secreted by the\r\nprostate and by Cowper's glands. Its fertilizing property depends on the\r\npresence of minute bodies, termed _spermatozoa_. These consist of little\r\npolliwig-shaped bodies (Fig. 3), having large heads and long filaments\r\nor tails. Under the microscope these little bodies are seen to describe\r\nmovements not unlike those of polliwigs.\r\n\r\nWHY EMISSIONS OF THE VITAL FLUID DEBILITATE. The seminal fluid consists\r\nof the most vital elements in the human body. It not only assists in\r\nmaintaining the life of the individual, but communicates the essential,\r\ntransforming principle which generates another mortal having an\r\nimperishable existence. Its waste is a wanton expenditure, which robs\r\nthe blood of its richness and exhausts the body of its animating powers.\r\nNo wonder that its loss enfeebles the constitution, and results in\r\nimpotency, premature decline, St. Vitus's dance, paralysis, epilepsy,\r\nconsumption, softening of the brain, and insanity. No wonder that\r\nconscience and fear become tormenting inquisitors, and that the symptoms\r\nare changed into imaginary specters of stealthily approaching disease.\r\n\r\n    \"There is no future pang\r\n    Can deal that justice on the self-condemned\r\n    He deals on his own soul.\"\r\n\r\nTHE PRACTICE OF ONANISM squanders the vitality and bankrupts the\r\nconstitution. Indigestion, innutrition, emaciation, shortness of breath,\r\npalpitation, nervous debility, are all symptoms of this exhaustion.\r\nSubsequently, the yellow skin reveals the bones, the sunken eyes are\r\nsurrounded by a leaden circle, the vivacious imagination becomes dull,\r\nthe active mind grows insipid--in short, the spring, or vital force,\r\nhaving lost its tension, every function wanes in consequence. Excessive\r\nlustful enjoyment produces feebleness, and finally terminates in disease\r\nand impotency.\r\n\r\nSEMINAL WEAKNESS may be the result of marital excesses. A _proper_\r\nsexual gratification contributes to the health and happiness of both\r\nparties. On the other hand, intemperate indulgence not only prevents\r\nfruitfulness, but ultimately, if persisted in, renders the husband\r\nentirely impotent, and undermines and destroys the constitution of the\r\nwife. Spermatorrhea may be induced by spinal irritation, intestinal\r\nworms, or piles. It may also result from inherited, as well as acquired,\r\nconstitutional weakness.\r\n\r\nNOCTURNAL OR NIGHT EMISSIONS. Involuntary emissions of semen most\r\nfrequently occur during amorous dreams at night, and are therefore\r\ntermed _nocturnal emissions_. Although they are at first occasioned by\r\nlascivious dreams, attended by erections and pleasurable sensations,\r\nyet, as the disease progresses, the erections become less perfect and\r\nthe losses are only revealed by the depression of spirits experienced\r\nthe following morning, and by the stiffened and stained spots on the\r\nlinen. At first, these emissions may occur but once in two or three\r\nweeks, unless the patient be excited by company, stimulation, food,\r\ndrinks, or other causes; but, at a later stage of the disease, they\r\nsometimes take place every night. In aggravated cases, the seminal sacs\r\nare so weakened that the warmth of the bed, friction of the clothing,\r\nreading obscene literature, viewing indecent pictures, indulging in lewd\r\nconversation, or even being in the presence of women, produces a waste\r\nof semen--many times unattended by erections. When there is great\r\nweakness, seminal discharges may be induced by lifting heavy weights,\r\npressure upon the genital organs, horseback riding, straining at stool,\r\nor even upon urinating, as observed when muscular efforts are made to\r\nexpel the last drops, which appear thick and viscid. If the urine be\r\nallowed to stand for a few hours, the seminal discharge will be\r\nprecipitated, and will form a light-colored deposit at the bottom of the\r\nvessel. If the sediment be examined with a microscope, spermatozoa can\r\nreadily be detected in it.\r\n\r\nWASTING AWAY OF THE TESTICLES. Masturbation not only occasions loss of\r\nsemen, but frequently the testicles and other generative organs waste\r\nand become reduced in size as a result of the abuse. Fig. 1 shows the\r\ntesticle in a healthy condition, while Fig. 2 represents one much\r\nreduced, as a result of self-abuse.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated Dr. Drewery, of London, speaking of the reason why\r\nmasturbation is so extremely injurious in its effects upon both body and\r\nmind, says:\r\n\r\n\"This is a question which I have often been asked by patients, and it is\r\none which is rather difficult to explain to any one not acquainted with\r\nthe phenomena of reflex nervous action.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps the simplest mode of putting it is to say that the effects\r\nproduced by the excitement of the parts are not the direct result of the\r\nstimulation, but that the excitement of the extremities of the nerves is\r\nconveyed through them to the spinal cord and brain, and that the\r\nemission which occurs, when sufficient stimulus has been applied, is the\r\nresult of nervous force reacting upon the parts from the spinal cord\r\nback again. This action is termed reflex, and is similar to that of\r\nvomiting, which is only produced through the medium of the great nervous\r\ncentres; so that if the nervous communication between the stomach and\r\nspinal cord and brain is cut off, nothing in the stomach could possibly\r\ncause vomiting, whereas if the communication remains intact, this action\r\ncan be immediately produced by irritation of nerves far away from the\r\nstomach, viz., by tickling the fauces, as every drunkard is well aware\r\nwho has ever put his finger down his throat for the purpose of emptying\r\nhis stomach of the contents which are poisoning him, but which without\r\nthe additional stimulus he is unable to expel. It will be seen,\r\ntherefore, from this that the act of emission is only produced through\r\nthe agency of the spinal cord, and not by any direct nervous action\r\nbetween the parts which are stimulated, and those which are concerned in\r\nthe emission.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.\r\nThe Testicle in a healthy condition.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.\r\nA Testicle wasted by Masturbation.]\r\n\r\n\"The brain is also concerned to the fullest extent in the production of\r\nthese phenomena, as are all the senses of the body; this is proved by\r\nthe fact that emissions occur during sleep, without any excitement\r\nbeyond the engorgement of the parts with blood, produced by the\r\ncerebellar congestion of the brain, usually found to follow lying upon\r\nthe back during sleep. This, however, is unnatural and unhealthy, and is\r\nusually the result, as before pointed out, of masturbation. But these\r\ntwo important points must be remembered--that emission may be produced\r\nby friction merely as a purely spinal reflex action, and it may be\r\ncaused by the action of the brain without any friction whatever. Both\r\nthese results are unhealthy and injurious. A true natural and healthy\r\nact of sexual intercourse demands the excitement of brain, spinal cord,\r\nand every nerve in the body simultaneously, and resembles the lightning\r\nflash which restores the equilibrium of electric force disturbed during\r\na thunderstorm.\r\n\r\n\"It is useless to endeavor to describe the marvelous actions of nervous\r\nforce, but from what has been said it is not difficult to comprehend\r\nthat if a convulsive action is produced in any part of the body by the\r\nsole excitement of the spinal cord, when it is necessary for its healthy\r\nand natural production that the brain and senses generally should be\r\nequally excited, the balance of nerve power is destroyed, which fact\r\nalone is proved by the effects upon the nervous system always following\r\nmasturbation, which is the irritation of the spinal cord without the\r\nassistance of the brain.\"\r\n\r\nVARIOUS COMPLICATIONS are likely to arise in the progress of this\r\nmalady.\r\n\r\nSTRICTURE of THE URETHRA, or water passage, is a very common\r\ncomplication and, even when quite slight, generally interferes very\r\nseriously with the cure of the spermatorrhea when overlooked by the\r\nattending physician, as is very commonly done, especially when the\r\nconstriction of the water passage is only slight. Very often it occurs\r\nin our practice that on examining a case of this disease that has been\r\nthe rounds of the doctors, we find a stricture, which had been entirely\r\noverlooked by other practitioners, being so slight as not to occasion\r\nserious obstruction to the flow of urine but yet sufficient to interfere\r\nvery much with the cure of the spermatorrhea. The size of the urethra,\r\nor water passage, should bear an exact and proportionate relation to\r\nthat of the penis, and when from any cause the urethra is contracted\r\nbelow this normal size, it should receive attention, as otherwise the\r\nstricture is likely to increase and the passage becomes so constricted\r\nas to produce serious disease of the bladder, and not fail to perpetuate\r\nspermatorrhea, when this disease exists.\r\n\r\nHYDROCELE (_Dropsy of the Scrotum_) consists of an undue secretion of\r\nthe fluid which moistens the _tunica vaginalis_, and may arise from an\r\nirritation of the testicle, produced by masturbation. This subject is\r\nfully considered in the Medical Adviser.\r\n\r\nVARICOCELE is a dilatation of the veins of the spermatic cord and\r\nscrotum, and is frequently a result of masturbation. It is readily\r\ndistinguished under the form of a soft, doughy, compressible, knotty,\r\nand unequal enlargement of the veins, and a tumid condition of the\r\nadjacent parts. One writer, speaking of the enlargement of the spermatic\r\nvessels, describes them as \"feeling like a coiled up bundle of worms.\"\r\n\r\nDISEASE OF THE PROSTATE GLAND is frequently caused by solitary\r\nindulgence. Venereal excesses produce congestion and the gland is\r\novernourished. It becomes greatly enlarged, a condition called\r\n_hypertrophy_. This affection gives rise to a heavy feeling or pressure\r\nin the region below the bladder, and often interferes seriously with\r\nurination, and gives great pain and uneasiness, and often results in\r\ngrave and dangerous complications.\r\n\r\nPROSTATORRHEA consists of an unnatural flowing or wasting of the\r\nprostatic secretion, which may be known by its mucous-like appearance,\r\nand, when placed within the field of the microscope, by the absence of\r\n_spermatozoa_ or fecundating germs. It is often mistaken for\r\nspermatorrhea, or for gleet, by inexperienced and careless physicians.\r\nFor a full consideration of diseases of the prostate gland, see Part IX\r\nof our Dime Series of pamphlets, which will be sent on receipt of ten\r\ncents in postage stamps.\r\n\r\nAgain, the habit of self-pollution weakens all the structures of the\r\ngenital organs, and induces seminal waste, which may lead to a morbid\r\ndiminution in the size of the prostate gland. This condition, which is\r\nexactly the opposite of the one above described, is _atrophy_. Any\r\ndisease which renders the circulation in the prostate gland languid and\r\nfeeble interferes with the nutrition of that organ and impairs its\r\nfunction.\r\n\r\nIMPOTENCY (_Loss of Sexual Power_). Masturbation prevents the\r\nexcitability of the nervous system and sexual organs and causes\r\ndebility, which is indicated by the premature discharge of semen during\r\nsexual intercourse. These premature emissions indicate not only partial\r\nimpotency, but also that the nerve-centres have become morbidly\r\nsensitive by the practice of solitary vice, or marital excesses. At\r\nlength the powers of the erectile tissues are diminished, and there is\r\nweakness which prevents the act of copulation, or the erection may be\r\nslow and not last long enough, on account of a faulty functional\r\ncondition of the spinal cord.\r\n\r\nA PECULIAR FORM OF IMPOTENCY is associated with certain abnormal\r\nnutritive changes which give rise to a lymphatic or fat condition of the\r\nsystem. Not that the temperament in all these cases is originally\r\nlymphatic, but the system degenerates in consequence of nutritive\r\nperversion. With the loss of sexual ardor, there is also apathy of mind,\r\nloss of manliness, and the victim becomes cold, dispassionate, and\r\ntreacherous, devoid of any admiration or love for the opposite sex. He\r\nacquires rotundity of person, the face is fat, smooth, often beardless,\r\nand the voice is feminine.\r\n\r\nThe victims of this disease represent two distinct classes, viz.: (1)\r\nthose who are fearfully tormented by the consciousness that they are\r\nlosing their virile powers, and become irritable, jealous and often\r\ndesperate; and (2) those who are completely indifferent to this\r\ndeprivation.\r\n\r\n(1.) Patients of the former class are readily restored to health by\r\nproper treatment, for they are willing to make an effort for the\r\nrecovery of their manly powers. There is not complete loss of sexual\r\ndesire, yet their disappointment is so great that they may entertain\r\nsuicidal thoughts. They are moody, fickle, discontented, excitable, and\r\nremarkably impulsive. With proper treatment, they regain tone of body,\r\nvigor of mind, an increase of sexual desire, and become more attentive\r\nto business affairs, and less indifferent to the gentler sex. With the\r\nrestoration of the general health and the sexual functions, remarkable\r\nconstitutional changes occur. It is often the case that their intimate\r\nfriends hardly recognize them by looks or acts.\r\n\r\n(2.) It is equally true that those who are wholly indifferent to the\r\nloss of virile power, uninterested in the evidences of their manhood,\r\nare sometimes incurable. In fact, it is useless to treat the latter\r\nclass, because they will neither co-operate with the physician, nor\r\npersist in the treatment necessary to effect a radical and\r\nconstitutional change.\r\n\r\nMasturbation perverts and finally destroys the secretory functions of\r\nthe testicles. It sometimes causes chronic inflammation, which may\r\nresult in obliteration of the minute seminal canals, or obstruction of\r\nthe conveying ducts. The sperm is imperfectly elaborated and totally\r\nunfit for procreative purposes. Sometimes the spermatozoa are entirely\r\nabsent, and, when present, are very few in number, incomplete in\r\nstructure, diseased, and deficient in power as well as in organization.\r\nFig. 3 represents the spermatozoa in a healthy condition, and Fig. 4,\r\nwhen they are sickly, deficient and inanimate. The husband may appear to\r\nbe healthy, and _his_ inability to procreate may be erroneously\r\nconsidered a defect in his wife.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS OF SPERMATORRHEA. The indications of abuse of the sexual organs\r\nare loss of nervous energy, dullness of the mental faculties, and\r\ndelight in obscene stories. The expression of the face becomes coarse,\r\nand the movements slow; the eye is sunken, the face bloated and pale,\r\nand the disposition is fretful and irritable; the appetite is\r\ncapricious, the throat irritated, and the patient makes frequent\r\nattempts to clear it, in order to speak distinctly. There are pains in\r\nthe chest, wakefulness, and during the night lascivious thoughts and\r\ndesires. The relish for play or labor is gone, and a growing distaste\r\nfor business is apparent; there is a determination of blood to the head,\r\nheadache, noises and roaring sounds in the ears, the eyes may be\r\nblood-shot and watery, weak or painful, the patient imagines bright\r\nspots or flashes passing before them, and there may be partial\r\nblindness. There is increasing stolidity of expression, the eye is\r\nwithout sparkle, and the face becomes blotched and animal-like in its\r\nexpression. The victim is careless of his personal appearance, not\r\nunscrupulously neat, and not unfrequently a rank odor exhales from the\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nThere are troublesome sensations, as of itching and crawling, in and\r\nabout the scrotum. Subsequently, there is obstinate constipation, and\r\nall the symptoms of dyspepsia follow. Gradually the pallor deepens, the\r\npatient becomes emaciated. There is a shortness of breath, palpitation\r\nafter even moderate exercise, trembling of the knees, and eruptions on\r\nthe skin. There may also be cough, hoarseness, stitch in the side, loss\r\nof voice. The sleep is not refreshing, the patient has frequent\r\nnightmare, or the dreams are lascivious, and the involuntary emissions\r\nof semen become more frequent. The weakness increasing, the sufferer\r\nexperiences a weakness in his legs and staggers like a drunken man, his\r\nhands tremble and he stammers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.\r\nMicroscopic appearance of healthy semen.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.\r\nMicroscopic appearance of semen which will not fecundate.]\r\n\r\nThe victim is unable to concentrate his thoughts, cannot remember what\r\nhe reads, and is mentally indolent. He begins to be suspicious of his\r\nfriends, has less confidence in others, and desires to be alone, is\r\ndespondent and has suicidal thoughts. He has pain in the back, does not\r\nlike to walk, and is inclined to lie down. The semen is prematurely\r\ndischarged upon attempting coition, and if there be offspring, it is apt\r\nto be feeble or subject to scrofula, consumption, or convulsions. The\r\ngenital organs, especially the penis and testicles, diminish in size, as\r\nthe disease progresses, lose their energy, and the glands of the penis\r\nbecome cold and flaccid. There is frequent desire to urinate, chronic\r\nirritation in the neck of the bladder, and pain in the spermatic cord\r\nand testicle, and sometimes in the end of the penis. The microscope\r\nshows that semen involuntarily discharged may be devoid of spermatozoa,\r\nor if present, they are defective, their heads being without tails. The\r\nurine is loaded with mucus or bears up a filmy, membranous, transparent\r\nmatter, or it may be covered with a thin fluid having an oily\r\nappearance, but in rare cases is clear. Again, it may hold substances in\r\nsolution, which are deposited in crystals or incrust the urine, or it\r\nmay precipitate a material having the appearance of brick-dust, and\r\nsometimes semen tinged with blood. The dyspeptic symptoms when present\r\nare followed by diarrhea. The limbs are cramped and rigid, the feet\r\nbloated, and the patient becomes melancholy and relinquishes all hope of\r\nrecovery. As the disease progresses, the patient lacks firmness and is\r\nabsent-minded.\r\n\r\nWhen the erections are imperfect and the semen is prematurely\r\ndischarged, or when a lengthy coition is required before the sperm can\r\nbe ejected, it is evident that the patient is rapidly becoming impotent;\r\nthe virile powers are vanishing and manhood is surrendering sway to a\r\nmerciless foe. We frequently witness this condition in men, even at the\r\nage of thirty-five, when the summit of vigor and strength should only\r\nhave been reached. How often are we solicited to restore these lost\r\nhopes and powers! To what tales of ignorance and recklessness, or\r\nsubmission and remorse, do we repeatedly listen from these unfortunate\r\nsufferers! In patients of this class, sexual intercourse prevents\r\nspontaneous emissions, but it does not remove the functional and organic\r\nderangements of the nerve-centres; hence, at a time when the victims of\r\nthis disease should be in the prime of life, they are impotent, and\r\nepilepsy, apoplexy, paralysis, softening of the brain, or insanity,\r\nfrequently results.\r\n\r\nEPILEPSY (OR FITS). This dread disease is one of the most common and\r\nserious complications of the more advanced stages of spermatorrhea. The\r\ninjury done to the nerve-centres by the practice of masturbation is\r\nmanifested in epileptic convulsions, more or less frequent. If proper\r\ntreatment be early adopted, and faithfully pursued, the case is not yet\r\nhopeless; though, in the majority of cases, the patient never recovers\r\nafter the disease assumes this phase.\r\n\r\nPARALYSIS. Paralysis, or Palsy, when occurring as a complication of\r\nspermatorrhea, may be preceded by an attack of apoplexy, in which the\r\npatient loses consciousness, and lays in a condition of profound stupor\r\nfor a time, and on recovery from his unconscious state, finds himself\r\nunable to use one or more of his limbs, or the disability and loss of\r\npower, which may also be accompanied by more or less loss of sensation,\r\nmay come on gradually, without any premonition or marked manifestation\r\nof its approach. In either case, its appearance is to be regarded as a\r\nmatter of serious importance. Paralysis, when occurring as a consequence\r\nof masturbation or sexual excesses, is usually difficult of cure; yet,\r\nnow and then, cases are cured at our Institutions even after this grave\r\nmalady has appeared as a complication.\r\n\r\nSOFTENING OF THE BRAIN. This malady, although less common as a result of\r\nmasturbation than the complications mentioned in the preceding\r\nparagraphs, is of sufficiently frequent occurrence to entitle it to a\r\npassing notice here. This condition usually results ultimately in\r\ncomplete dementia, or loss of reason. It is an incurable disease.\r\n\r\nINSANITY. This deplorable malady is not a very uncommon result of\r\nmasturbation and its various resultant morbid conditions, as the records\r\nof the many institutions for the unfortunate class of sufferers from\r\nthis disease bear abundant witness. Sometimes it manifests itself in the\r\nmilder forms of hallucination, or monomania, but in the majority of\r\ncases, the patient sinks into a despondent hypochondria, which is many\r\ntimes followed, sooner or later, by a raving mania.\r\n\r\nIn cases of monomania resulting from masturbation, the mental\r\nderangement is often so slight as to escape detection by the patient's\r\nfriends, the peculiar freaks of disposition being regarded rather as\r\neccentricities of character than as symptoms of serious disease. Fits of\r\ndespondency are usually common with such sufferers. The mental\r\nderangement is not always accompanied or preceded by spermatorrhea or\r\nfrequent seminal emissions, the injury done to the nervous system by the\r\npractice of self-abuse, or sexual excesses, being first noticeable in\r\nvarious phantasms or imaginings on the part of the patient. These are,\r\nin different cases, so various, both in character and degree, as not to\r\nadmit of any classification, each case presenting phases peculiar to\r\nitself. In many cases, the patient imagines that his best friends are\r\nconspiring to injure him, or that some great calamity is about to befall\r\nhim. In most cases there is danger of the patient's committing suicide,\r\nif not closely watched. Especially is this true of those who suffer from\r\nfits of hypochondria.\r\n\r\nExcept in its milder forms, insanity resulting from masturbation and\r\nsexual excesses, is rarely curable.\r\n\r\nDON'T BE ALARMED. A nocturnal seminal emission now and then, or at long\r\nintervals is not, in and of itself, evidence of the existence of\r\nspermatorrhea or other serious disease. A full blooded, strong,\r\npassionate man, in vigorous health, and who has never abused himself,\r\nmay now and then, at long intervals, if his sexual passions be not\r\ngratified naturally, or if he permit his mind to run much upon\r\nlascivious subjects, experience an emission while asleep and dreaming.\r\nAs to whether such occurrences are evidence of disease or not, in any\r\ngiven case, depends upon their frequency, and as to whether they are the\r\nresult of a weakness of the organs and are followed by more or less\r\ndepression and debility, or are merely the overflow of a robust system,\r\nor the outburst of restrained, pent-up, and ungratified passions. In the\r\nlatter case, and when only occurring at long intervals, the emissions\r\nare not followed by any perceptible enervating or weakening effects.\r\n\r\nQUACKERY RAMPANT. This country is flooded with cheap circulars and\r\npamphlets, circulated openly and broadcast, wherein ignorant,\r\npretentious, blatant quacks endeavor to frighten young men who may never\r\nhave practiced self-abuse, or been guilty of excesses in any way, and\r\nyet who experience, now and then at long intervals, nocturnal seminal\r\nemissions. In such cases, it is the duty of the conscientious, honest,\r\nand sympathetic practitioner of the healing art to give assurance, and\r\nnot to unnecessarily alarm those who experience nothing inconsistent\r\nwith a state of fairly good health. To frighten such young men into\r\nbelieving themselves diseased, when in reality they experience nothing\r\nbut what may occasionally occur in the experiences of any robust,\r\nhealthy man, is the most detestable, downright quackery.\r\n\r\nTREATING THE WRONG DISEASE. Not only are many men subjected to useless\r\ntreatment by general practitioners who overlook the real disease, caused\r\nby pernicious youthful habits pursued in solitude, or later excesses in\r\nvenery, but the female sex are also quite as often subjected to\r\ntreatment for diseases which do not exist, the real trouble being\r\nnervous debility and other weaknesses that have resulted from the\r\nyouthful pernicious practices common to both sexes, or later excesses in\r\nmarital pleasures.\r\n\r\nMORAL CONSIDERATIONS. Masturbation is a habit which tyrannizes over the\r\nmind, perverts the imagination, and forces upon the victim venereal\r\ndesires, even while he is forming the strongest resolutions to reform.\r\nIt constrains into its service the higher faculties, such as friendship,\r\nconfidence, love, reason, and imagination, to make its ideal graceful\r\nand beautiful.\r\n\r\nSENSUAL LUST. The fancy creates an attractive partner, possessed of\r\ngirlish beauty, a perfect type of goodness, blended with sexuality, and\r\nwhom the subject worships with all the ardor of passion. Around this\r\n_beau ideal_ all his affections are clustered; to her the purest of his\r\nblood is offered in sacrifice, and it is no wonder that female\r\nassociates seem tame and unattractive when such imaginary and consummate\r\ndivinity is courted. In the sensual delirium is conceived an elysium of\r\ncarnal bliss, where half-nude nymphs display their charms and invite to\r\nsensual enjoyments. Thus we see how this habit makes the spiritual\r\nfaculties subservient to morbid passion, and by what means elevating\r\ninfluences are prostituted to vulgar and base-born creations.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS VARY IN DIFFERENT CASES. We can only partially delineate the\r\nterrible effects resulting from the abuse of the sexual organs. The\r\nsymptoms are multitudinous, but, as we have before stated, no two\r\npersons are similarly influenced by this disease. The symptoms will vary\r\naccording to the severity of the affection, the age of the patient, and\r\nhis constitutional peculiarities. The presence of only a few of the\r\nsymptoms which we have enumerated is evidence of abnormal weakness,\r\nwhich demands treatment.\r\n\r\nMontaigne says: \"We must see and get acquainted with our sins if we\r\nexpect to correct them.\" Virtue presupposes trials just as much as\r\nvictory implies warfare. The triumph of virtue is to defeat morbid or\r\nexcessive passion, for virtue is only realized when it is a conquering\r\nforce. Innocence is passive but virtue is an active quality, purified in\r\nthe fiery furnace of temptation. As men have in all ages been influenced\r\nby passions, so temptation has ever found its victims. It is an\r\nobligation that one owes to himself to overcome every evil passion or\r\nweakness to which he is subject, and the discharge of this personal duty\r\nrequires moral courage.\r\n\r\nTHE REWARD OF VIRTUE. Our Saviour invited all erring mortals to enter\r\nupon a higher life when He said, \"Come unto Me, all ye that labor and\r\nare heavy laden, and I will give you rest.\" The invitation is\r\naccompanied with a promise. To all who are weary of excess and bowed\r\ndown by passion, rest and restoration are promised, if they will but\r\nreform and employ proper means to that end.\r\n\r\nTHE SUFFERERS MUST REFORM. Just as there is no spiritual restoration\r\nwithout obeying the Saviour, so there can be no physical restoration\r\nunless we fulfill nature's imposed conditions. There can be no salvation\r\nunless sin be discarded, and so there can be no redemption from the bad\r\neffects of a practice, so long as it is continued. It is no easy task to\r\nmaster a despotic passion. Appetite is often stronger than the will. The\r\ntreatment must begin with moral reformation. Every manly impulse, and\r\nall the higher qualities of the patient's nature, must be enlisted in\r\nthe struggle for virtue and health.\r\n\r\nIf the passions are restrained, then the capital of health increases,\r\nfor the saving of the vital secretions is equal to compound interest.\r\nThis illustrates the truth of the Latin proverb: \"_No gain is so certain\r\nas that which proceeds from the economical use of what you have\"!_ The\r\npatient actually acquires confidence and manly courage by the retention\r\nof the seminal fluid, which directly increases his virile powers.\r\n\r\nHYGIENIC ADVICE TO PATIENTS. Daily physical exercise and regular habits\r\nmust be established. It is important that the mind, as well as the\r\nphysical powers, be directed into active and wholesome channels. There\r\nmust be restraint and discipline. It is useless to begin medical\r\ntreatment while the patient continues to read exciting, amorous stories\r\nand obscene books, which are suggestive of lewd thoughts. Something\r\npractical ought to occupy the thoughts and engage the hands.\r\n\r\nRegular and vigorous physical exercise is necessary to assist the\r\ncirculation of the blood, and compel its determination into the minute\r\nand extreme parts of the vascular system. When the blood is thus\r\ndirected, nutrition is more vigorous and the activity of all the\r\nfunctions is augmented.\r\n\r\nNot only should there be regularity in eating, but sound discretion\r\nshould be exercised in selecting a plain, wholesome diet, consisting of\r\nsuch articles of food as best favor a daily and free evacuation of the\r\nbowels. Avoid the use of those articles of food which produce excessive\r\nacidity of the stomach. Hearty or late suppers are not allowable. The\r\npatient should use no alcoholic beverages, and should abstain from such\r\nstimulants as tea, coffee, beer, wine, and tobacco. We cannot even\r\nrecommend their _moderate_ use, for total abstinence is the better plan.\r\n\r\nThe patient should sleep in a well-ventilated room, on a hard bed, and\r\nhave only sufficient covering for warmth and comfort. He should not lie\r\nupon the back, because in this position nightly emissions are more\r\nlikely to occur. The patient should go to bed when he feels sleepy, and\r\nnot resist the inclination until wakefulness is induced.\r\n\r\nHe should rise early in the morning and immediately take a cold hand\r\nbath. For this purpose a quart or two of water and a common hand towel\r\nonly are required. After bathing, rub the surface of the body with the\r\ndry hand or a crash towel, and continue the friction until the skin is\r\nred and a reaction is established. Do not excuse yourself from following\r\nthese hygienic suggestions. A refreshing bath changes the morbid\r\nsensibilities to a more healthful state by the reaction of the nervous\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nIt is beneficial to apply a towel saturated with cold water to the\r\ngenital organs fifteen minutes before leaving the bed. Douching, or\r\nshowering the genital organs with cold water once or twice a day will\r\nalso be beneficial. It should not be practiced, however, just before\r\ngoing to bed. It is well to bathe the head with cold water, and this can\r\nbe done much better if the hair be kept closely cut.\r\n\r\nHorseback riding, climbing, and all exercises which rub, chafe, or\r\nexcite the genital organs, should be avoided. Even the clothing should\r\nbe loose, so that walking will not produce friction or cause any\r\nexcitement of these organs. The calls of nature should receive prompt\r\nattention, and the urine be voided at any time (especially during the\r\nnight) when there is an inclination. If there be irritation of the\r\nbladder and lower bowels, the patient will receive decided benefit from\r\nthe daily use of an injection of cold water into the bowels. From a half\r\npint to a pint of cold water may be used at one time, and the injection\r\nshould be retained for a few minutes before going to bed. The bowels\r\nwill thus be relieved, the heat and irritation subdued, and the\r\nliability to seminal emissions lessened.\r\n\r\nPatients afflicted with spermatorrhea should not allow their thoughts to\r\ndwell upon their ailments, for they are apt to become moody,\r\nself-deceived, and even insane upon this subject. To avoid this,\r\nharmless amusements should be indulged in, and good moral company\r\ncultivated. They become suspicious, skeptical, and believe that they are\r\nvictims of imposture. When they lose self-reliance, their faith and\r\ntrust in others begins to waver, especially if their health does not\r\nimprove so rapidly as they had anticipated: As much depends upon the\r\nfaithful observance of the hygienic rules as upon the constant and\r\nproper use of medicines. The rapidity of recovery depends upon the\r\nconstitutional energies and the vigor of the vital resources. If the\r\nblood be greatly impoverished, or the nervous system much impaired,\r\nrecovery will be necessarily slow. Time, patience, and perseverance, are\r\njust as essential to a recovery from the effects of these abuses as the\r\nbest medical treatment that can be employed.\r\n\r\nTHE MEDICAL TREATMENT OF SPERMATORRHEA AND IMPOTENCY. Few diseases\r\nrequire so many modifications of treatment, to suit the peculiarities of\r\nindividual cases as spermatorrhea, because it is attended with so many\r\ncomplications and morbid functional and structural changes. Every\r\ncomplication must be considered, and great judgment exercised in the\r\nselection of remedies. As this selection must depend upon the\r\npeculiarities of the case involved, it is impossible to impart to the\r\nnon-professional readers sufficient medical knowledge to enable them to\r\nchoose the appropriate remedies for these intricate disorders. Hence it\r\nwould be useless to specify the various medicines which our specialists\r\nemploy in treating them. It would only lead to many fruitless\r\nexperiments, which might result in great harm to the afflicted. For\r\nremedies powerful enough to effect cures of spermatorrhea and impotency\r\nare capable, when improperly employed, of doing great harm. Especially\r\nshould all ready-made, proprietary or put-up medicines, such as are sold\r\nin drug stores and chemists' shops, be avoided, for reasons already\r\nmentioned. Great harm, also, often results from the employment of\r\n\"galvanic belts,\" \"galvanic batteries and pads,\" and other catch-penny\r\ndevices, with which the too confiding are not only duped and swindled,\r\nbut terribly injured. They are all worse than useless, and often render\r\nthe mildest case very difficult to cure by inducing serious\r\ncomplications. It is better to take no medical treatment, but rely\r\nsolely on the hygienic advice we have given, rather than to resort to\r\nany of the so-called \"_specifics\"_ found in the drug shops, or to any\r\nsuch silly, good-for-nothing trash as the various \"Pastilles,\"\r\n\"Boluses,\" \"Curative Rings,\" \"Voltaic Belts,\" or other quackish\r\nmedicines and contrivances.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANCE OF HYGIENIC DISCIPLINE. The invalid should restrict his\r\nattention to hygiene, and learn that patient endurance and heroic\r\nperseverance are necessary, even when taking the most efficient\r\nremedies. His entire system having gradually become deranged, corrective\r\nmedicines must necessarily be _chronic_ in their operations; in other\r\nwords, they must act insensibly, slowly, and progressively. Some of the\r\nsymptoms of sexual weakness will, under proper hygienic and medical\r\ntreatment, generally begin to disappear within a month. If the nervous\r\nsystem be very much impaired, however, a longer time will elapse before\r\nthe restorative effects of treatment will be observed. Neither the\r\nphysician nor the patient should expect that a broken-down constitution\r\ncan be immediately repaired. The day of miracles is past. The most\r\nrational method of treating the sick promises nothing supernatural,\r\nnothing which is not in accordance with science. Diseases of this\r\ncharacter are always slow in their inception, or development and\r\nprogress, and must be cured in like manner, step by step. Nature never\r\nhurries; atom by atom, little by little, she achieves her work.\r\n\r\nOUR IMPROVED TREATMENT. Tears ago our specialists resolved to pay\r\nparticular attention to the investigation and treatment of these\r\ndiseases, which are not only alarmingly prevalent, but sadly neglected\r\nand mistreated by the general practitioner of medicine.\r\n\r\nUNFAILING REMEDIES. Having successfully treated many thousands of cases,\r\nwe can safely say of our remedies that they are very positive in their\r\nremedial effects. The great success which has attended the employment of\r\nthese remedies has led us to rely upon them with implicit faith. By\r\ntheir persistent use, spermatorrhea and threatened impotency can be\r\ncured as readily as other chronic or lingering diseases. We particularly\r\nsolicit those cases which have heretofore been regarded as incurable.\r\nThe patient is subjected to no surgical operation, and he can safely and\r\naccurately follow the directions given, while the treatment does not\r\ninterfere with any ordinary occupation in which he may be engaged. These\r\ndelicate diseases should not be intrusted to physicians who advertise\r\nunder fictitious names, or to those of ordinary qualifications. The\r\ngeneral practitioner may be thoroughly read in these diseases, but he\r\ncannot acquire the skill of a specialist who annually treats thousands\r\nof cases, while the former seldom, if ever, has occasion to prescribe\r\nfor them.\r\n\r\nSIGNS OF IMPROVEMENT WHEN UNDER TREATMENT. Under our peculiar and\r\nimproved system of treatment, gradual improvement in the patient's\r\ncondition will be manifested. The eye becomes more brilliant and\r\nsparkling, the patient is less morose, his digestion improves, he is\r\nless listless and despondent, takes more interest in business and other\r\naffairs, his sleep is less disturbed and more refreshing, the strength\r\nimproves, and, if the sexual organs had become wasted in size, weak in\r\nfunction, and flaccid and soft, they begin, by and by, to have more tone\r\nand firmness, and to develope and increase in size, as their nutrition\r\nis restored, by the checking of the exhausting drain which they have\r\nsustained. If nocturnal emissions occur occasionally, the discharge\r\nwill, under the microscope, be found to be less watery, and to contain\r\nincreased numbers of _spermatozoa_, with heads and filaments perfect.\r\nThe patient now begins to gain in self-confidence, courage, and other\r\nmanly attributes, and, instead of the bashful, retiring, nervous,\r\nlanguid hypochondriac, we see a man of ambition and energy, competent to\r\nbattle with the adversities of life. Who can estimate the value of such\r\na transformation from nervousness and despondency to vigorous manhood?\r\nWho would begrudge all their earthly goods and treasures when thus\r\nafflicted, to be so restored to health and enjoyment for of what avail\r\nare the greatest riches when health and manhood itself are lost?\r\n\r\nOUR TERMS BUSINESS-LIKE AND FAIR. Occasionally persona solicit us to\r\nundertake the cure of these ailments, and, in case of failure, receive\r\nno compensation. They write: \"If you will _warrant_ that your\r\nprescriptions will result in a _perfect restoration to health_, we will\r\ngladly pay the fees that you ask.\" The absurdity of such a request is\r\napparent, and therefore we answer: \"We cannot _warrant_ that you will\r\nlive even for the next twenty-four hours. We do not bet, play for\r\nstakes, or wager our skill for money. Personal responsibility cannot be\r\nshifted or evaded, and life and health, with all their momentous\r\nconsiderations, are necessarily individual affairs. Therefore a proposal\r\nto make the conditions of health a subject of speculation is a challenge\r\nto gamble.\" The patient may not comply with the specified conditions,\r\nand the physician's success depends upon a faithful application of the\r\nprescribed treatment. For these reasons only a quack will be a party to\r\nany such transaction. Ours is not a trading, hazardously speculative\r\nprofession. Besides, thousands of our patients reside long distances\r\naway and we cannot know of their responsibility or honesty, nor spend\r\ntime inquiring after their financial standing.\r\n\r\nEVIDENCES OF THE CURABILITY OF SPERMATORRHEA AND IMPOTENCY. Many\r\nindividuals afflicted with spermatorrhea and impotency, particularly\r\nthose who have been swindled by some of the many charlatans who are to\r\nbe found in nearly every city, are incredulous, and doubt our ability to\r\ncure these maladies. Others are skeptical, because their physician, who\r\nmay be a very skillful general practitioner, but who has had very little\r\nor no experience in treating these delicate maladies, has failed to\r\nrelieve them, and, perhaps, has told them the disease is incurable.\r\n\r\nWe therefore beg the indulgence of our readers for here offering some\r\nindisputable evidence of the extraordinary success which we have\r\nachieved, by our peculiar methods of treating these affections, as\r\npursued at the World's Dispensary and Invalids' Hotel and Surgical\r\nInstitute.\r\n\r\nThis evidence is introduced for the encouragement of an unfortunate\r\nclass of invalids, for many of whom existence has ceased to possess any\r\ncharms. The grateful manifestations which we have received from this\r\nclass of sufferers have afforded us one of the greatest pleasures of our\r\nlives, and have alone been a rich remuneration for the diligent study\r\nand arduous labors devoted to the investigation of these diseases and to\r\nthe perfecting of our peculiar and successful methods of treating them.\r\n\r\nSACREDLY CONFIDENTIAL. In introducing the following extracts from our\r\nextensive files of letters, the names of the writers will be omitted, as\r\nwe regard all such correspondence, as well as facts communicated to us\r\nin personal consultations, as _sacredly confidential._\r\n\r\nLack of space and fear of wearying the reader, prevent us from\r\nintroducing more than a few extracts; but these are only fair samples of\r\n_thousands_ that have been received. Those given, present cases in\r\nalmost every stage of treatment, some soon after commencing, others\r\nfurther advanced, and still others which are cured. If we could devote\r\nthe space, and had we time to select them, we could insert an almost\r\nunlimited number of those received from patients who have been perfectly\r\ncured; but we think the reader will be more interested in expressions\r\ncoming from patients in all stages of treatment, as they are daily\r\nreceived. Therefore, without regard for literary excellence, we append a\r\nnumber chosen miscellaneously, and given _verbatim_. They express the\r\nsentiments of persons in all stages of life, and illustrate the views\r\nand feelings generally entertained by those whom we have been called\r\nupon to treat.\r\n\r\nThe following extracts are spontaneous acknowledgments, and are,\r\ntherefore, more valuable and truthful than if obtained by solicitation,\r\na practice contrary to our sense of propriety, and, hence, one in which\r\nwe never indulge. Although ofttimes less expressive of satisfaction and\r\ngratitude than if the communication were presented in full, yet only\r\nsufficient space can be spared for a brief quotation from each letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONIALS\r\n\r\n\r\nCASE 175,827.

The emissions have ceased and the losses at\r\nstool and in the water have left me. Eighteen months ago I was almost a\r\ncomplete wreck; now I take an Interest in business and am in excellent\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\nRespectfully, S., Waveland, Ind.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASE 177,068. SPERMATORRHEA. LOSS OF VITAL STRENGTH. CARED WITH SEVEN\r\nMONTHS' TREATMENT.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION: _Gentlemen_--You have\r\nundoubtedly wondered at my long silence. Since last I wrote you there\r\nhas been a marked change in my life (of which I will speak further on),\r\nunder your skillful treatment. I improved so rapidly, notwithstanding\r\nthe many interruptions which misfortune on my part occasioned, that six\r\nmonths ago I considered myself cured. I have been married three months\r\nand a half to a worthy woman, who should have gained for herself a\r\nhusband who never deviated from a virtuous path as much as I; but the\r\nattachment formed was so strong that no misfortune seemed powerful\r\nenough to sever it. The barrier which seemed insurmountable, and which I\r\nhad erected myself by early indiscretions and excesses, has given way,\r\nthanks to your superior medical knowledge and skillful treatment. Again\r\nI can hold up my head and say, \"I am a man. I never fail to call the\r\nattention of my friends to your Institution as the best in the world,\r\nfor I have reason to know that it is truly so. I have recommended two\r\nfriends of mine to you, who are under your treatment, and are getting\r\nwell. One has tried all the local physicians, and many firms, but with\r\nno success. May God bless you, and may your Institution meet with all\r\nthe success it so richly deserves, is the prayer and wish of one you\r\nhave caved. J., Leadville, Colo.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASE 178,666. EMISSIONS, AND LOSS OF WEIGHT AND STRENGTH.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION: _Gentlemen_--I have had no\r\nemissions now for some time, and feel well in every way. I am gaining in\r\nstrength and weight, and find I shall not need further medical\r\ntreatment. The four months' medicines that you have sent me have\r\neffected a radical regeneration in my health, and I thank you for it.\r\nM., Hartford, Conn.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASE 111,477. SPERMATORRHEA AND IRRITABLE BLADDER; CURED BY TWO MONTHS'\r\nTREATMENT.\r\n\r\nThis was a badly complicated case of spermatorrhea, the patient being\r\nalso troubled with frequent urination, partial impotency, mucous\r\ndischarges from the urethra, and a burning sensation in the testicle and\r\ngroin.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.: _Gentlemen_--I\r\ntook the two months' treatment sent me by you as directed. After taking\r\nthe first month's treatment the emissions ceased entirely, my appetite\r\nincreased, and I slept much better. Eight months ago I finished the\r\nsecond month's treatment and have since been in perfect health. I am\r\nfully convinced that you do every thing that you promise. I am,\r\ngentlemen, yours respectfully,\r\n\r\n    R., Fort Totten, Dakota.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASE 266,080. SPERMATORRHEA. THREATENED IMPOTENCY. A SEVERE CASE, CURED\r\nBY SIX MONTHS' TREATMENT.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION: _Gentlemen_--I have received the\r\nlast medicine sent me, and have taken all with the best results. I have\r\nso improved in health that I think it unnecessary for me to take any\r\nmore medicine. It is now several days since I took the last of the\r\nmedicine, and have not had any return of the disease. The desire to\r\nmasturbate seems to have left me, and I feel well, happy and strong.\r\nWhen I look back to the time before I commenced to take your medicine,\r\nthe change that has taken place seems wonderful. I had lost all hope of\r\nbeing restored from the ruinous habit I had practiced for many years\r\nwithout knowing how fatal it was to health. I tried hard to stop the\r\npractice, but it had grown so strong on me that I would always practice\r\nit again, and was fast becoming impotent. Had emissions at night; was\r\nnervous, downhearted; and I lost flesh, and felt miserable in many ways\r\ntoo numerous to mention. But now I feel healthy and well. If I had been\r\nmore careful, and had not stopped treatment so soon before, I might have\r\nbeen cured in four or five months. Nevertheless, I am well satisfied,\r\nand thankful that I am restored to health in six months; and I wish to\r\nexpress my sincere thanks to you and your Institution, for I owe my\r\nrestoration to health and happiness to you. If in the future I need any\r\nmedical skill, I shall always apply to your Institution, being certain\r\nof receiving the best attention. Yours thankfully, S., Pittsburgh, Pa.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASE 62,365. VERY BAD CASE OF SPERMATORRHEA AND IMPOTENCY. CURED WITH\r\nSIX MONTHS' TREATMENT.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION: _Gentlemen_--It has now been\r\nnine months since I stopped your treatment, and as there has been no\r\nreturn of former symptoms, I judge there can be no doubt as to my cure\r\nbeing permanent. I must confess that, having been duped and swindled by\r\nso many previous to visiting you, I had not much confidence when I went\r\nto Buffalo to see you. But your specialists, and your Manager, seemed to\r\ntalk so straightforwardly and without making any of those extravagant\r\npromises that I have become so used to, that I became convinced of your\r\nskill before I had been long in your wonderful Institution. I think\r\nalmost any invalid who will visit your Hotel, and see for themselves the\r\nwonderful appliances that you have accumulated for the cure of disease,\r\nmust soon become convinced that if there can be any hope of relief it\r\ncan be secured there, if anywhere. There I saw those who told me they\r\nhad been brought there on beds or couches for hundreds of miles, and\r\nthat they had not been able to walk for two to four years, and yet with\r\ntwo or three months' treatment were able to go about everywhere, and\r\nwere about ready to return home. Such experiences as these established\r\nmy confidence, and to-day I bless the day I first visited the Invalids'\r\nHotel. True, it took six months to cure me, but I presume you seldom\r\nhave cases to equal in severity the condition I was in when I applied to\r\nyou. I was so bad, as you will remember, though I do not suppose you\r\nrely upon any thing but your records in referring to cases, having so\r\nmany under treatment at all times, at all events, if you will turn to\r\nthe record of my case, which is \"File No. 62,365,\" you will see that I\r\nhad discharges of semen every time my bowels moved and without\r\nerections. In fact, I was completely impotent. I am now as strong and\r\nvigorous as any man. You told me it would probably take a year to cure\r\nme, but as you accomplished it in five months, though I continued to\r\ntake medicine a month longer to insure against a relapse, I think myself\r\nvery fortunate. Should any of your staff have occasion to come this way,\r\nI should be only to glad to do any thing I can to entertain them.\r\n\r\n    Gratefully yours,\r\n    C., St. Louis, Mo.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASE 183,998. GENERAL DEBILITY. EMISSIONS AND LOSS OF ENERGY. URINARY\r\nIRRITATION.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION: _Gentlemen_--The reason for my\r\nnot continuing treatment further than the fourth month, is the fact that\r\nmy health is so much improved that I do not need it. I feel like a new\r\nbeing. All of my bad symptoms are gone, and I feel that I am cured. For\r\neight months my health has continued to improve all the time. I owe you\r\nand your staff a debt of gratitude that I can never pay.\r\n\r\nYours with thanks, H., Johnson's Bayou, La.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASE 152,504.

I feel like a new man; am able to\r\ndo a full day's work without pain or laziness. I am very thankful for\r\nthe benefits I have received through your skill, and should I think it\r\nnecessary at any time for me to renew the treatment, I will be glad to\r\ncall on you.\r\n\r\nYours with great respect.

SEMINAL AND NERVOUS DEBILITY.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION: _Gentlemen_--My case was one of\r\nlong standing, and had brought me to think and meditate more of dying a\r\nconsumptive's death, than living. The ill success I had met in trying to\r\nrecover my lost manhood, had put me in such a constantly low-spirited\r\ncondition, that nothing was interesting or pleasurable. I am highly\r\npleased to report the improvement in my condition. My voice, weak and\r\nhoarse when I commenced treatment, is now strong and masculine. Hope and\r\nself-confidence have returned, and my countenance is firm and resolute.\r\nThe dull, heavy, pressing pain under my left shoulder, is entirely gone,\r\nlong ago.

Words at my command are inadequate to express\r\nmy feelings when I realize the great beneficial features of your most\r\nexcellent remedy. I have spoken to several of my most intimate friends\r\nwho are similarly affected, and after I took the first dose I was\r\ncompletely relieved, and the flesh I gained was in such abundance that I\r\nwas scarcely identified by them. I gave part of your _par excellence_\r\nmedicine to a bosom companion of mine, named ----. He became\r\nconvalescent, but desires another bottle. Write to him at once. Your\r\nname will be held in the highest esteem by these invalids, and by\r\n\r\n    Yours respectfully, H., Cincinnati, Ohio.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASE 143,838.

Before I sent to you I consulted my family doctor,\r\nand asked him what he thought of my case. To give you his own words, he\r\nsaid. \"J., I think you will be an entire cripple.\" I then thought I\r\nwould write to you. I had not taken more than three months' medicine\r\nwhen I was out in the harvest field. I sleep all night, have a good\r\nappetite, my back has got well, and I can lay all night. My limbs are\r\nstronger, and my nerves are again all right. Upon the whole I am a new\r\nman, and my mental powers are much relieved.

When I first wrote to\r\nyou I felt as if my life on earth was short, indeed; but, thank God,\r\nthrough His help and yours, I have been saved from filling an early\r\ngrave as the results of self-abuse. Before I began treatment I was pale\r\nand sickly; I had palpitation of the heart so bad that I often expected\r\nto drop dead in the street; I had loss of voice; always felt tired; I\r\nhad involuntary emissions of semen in the night, which always made me\r\nfeel weak through the next day; whilst quite often my mind was filled\r\nwith suicidal thoughts. Such was the price I was compelled to pay for\r\nviolating the laws of God and nature. Now every thing is changed. I\r\nthank you a thousand times, Doctor, for the great good you nave done me.\r\nMay God bless you. I shall always be pleased to recommend your treatment\r\nto everybody, and I will cheerfully answer any communication that I may\r\nreceive in relation to this.

NERVOUS DEBILITY AND IMPOTENCY.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION: _Gentlemen_--I have taken the\r\nlast of the medicine which you sent me, and feel satisfied it has\r\nentirely cured me. I return my thanks to you for the good you have done\r\nme. F., East Liverpool, Ohio.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASE 69,116. SEMINAL WEAKNESS, WITH CANCEROUS TESTICLE.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION: _Gentlemen_--It has now been\r\nover two years since you treated me and found it necessary to remove one\r\ntesticle on account of cancerous disease, that must soon have destroyed\r\nlife had the operation not been performed. T feel myself a strong,\r\nhealthy man, having had no symptoms of the seminal weakness for months\r\npast. Yours, P., Pittsburgh. Penn's.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASE 51,417. IMPOTENCY.\r\n\r\nI am getting along so well with the medicine that I am a standing wonder\r\nto my friends, and I shall not cease, while life lasts, to praise the\r\nskill that has brought about such miraculous results.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly,\r\n    K., Chillicothe, Ohio.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASE 67,004. IMPOTENCY.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION: _Gentlemen_--I am only too happy\r\nto say that I have fully recovered my powers in every particular since\r\nplacing myself under your treatment. I would not take $5,000 for the\r\ngood you have done me. I am only sorry that I did not go to you before\r\nwasting time and money on the quacks connected with that \"Museum of\r\nAnatomy\" in New York.\r\n\r\n    T., Philadelphia, Penn'a.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASE 67,208. SPERMATORRHEA.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION: _Gentlemen_--When placing myself\r\nunder your treatment, I was told that my case being an exceedingly bad\r\none, it would probably require six months in which to effect a perfect\r\ncure. After taking your remedies four months I found myself in perfect\r\nhealth, and have remained so ever since. I cannot express the gratitude\r\nI feel for you, and can never half repay the debt of gratitude I owe\r\nyou. I have given your pamphlet,-\"Abuse of the Male Generative Organs\r\nand the Diseases to which it Gives Rise,\" to quite a number of young men\r\nwhom I had reason to suspect it might benefit.\r\n\r\n    Gratefully yours, T., Norfolk, Virginia.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASE 67,070. SPERMATORRHEA.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION: _Gentlemen_--I have now returned\r\nhome a now man, after four months' treatment from you. I need no more\r\nmedicines now. I would urge all suffering to go to you for help.\r\nThanking you for your services,\r\n\r\n    I remain yours truly,\r\n    R., Bunch, Iowa.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASE 431,637. IMPOTENCY, WITH NERVOUS DEBILITY AND LIVER DISEASE.\r\n\r\nThis gentleman applied for the relief of the following symptoms:\r\nExhausting and frequent seminal emissions, losses in the urine, want of\r\nmanly strength, nervous prostration, indigestion, torpid condition of\r\nthe liver, headache, nausea, and constipation. After a course of five\r\nmonths' treatment he writes:\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION: _Gentlemen_--I am very grateful\r\nto you for the good you have done me, and I feel like a man now. It is\r\nsometime since I left off medicine. I have continued to improve, and I\r\nfeel better than I have for years before treatment. I am happy at the\r\nrestoration of my health and vigor. I shall recommend you to all\r\nsufferers. Hoping you will continue to be successful.\r\n\r\n    I remain,\r\n    Yours truly,\r\n    P., Canaan, Conn.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASE 111,489. SEMINAL EMISSIONS, LOSS OF MEMORY AND GENERAL DECLINE.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n_Gentlemen_--Inclosed please find money for my last supply of medicines.\r\nYou seem to understand my condition thoroughly. My color, appetite, and\r\nstrength have improved wonderfully, and my sleep is sound, undisturbed\r\nand refreshing. Under the influence of your medicines I have completely\r\nrecovered my mental and physical powers, and I feel that I am able to\r\ndiscontinue further treatment. The emissions have become less and less\r\nfrequent until now they do not trouble me at all.\r\n\r\n    I remain, yours truly, H., Eagle Springs, Coryell Co., Tex.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASE 51,203. SPERMATORRHEA. PERFECT CURE. HIS LETTER BEFORE TREATMENT,\r\nAND AFTER.\r\n\r\n(First letter.)\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION: _Dear Sirs_--It was my pleasant\r\nprivilege to read concerning your skill in the treatment of all kinds of\r\ndiseases, and concerning your reputation, which is most justly merited.\r\nEncouraged by these facts to place explicit confidence in you. I beg\r\nleave to state my own case as clearly as I may be able. It is as sad as\r\nit is fatal if no thorough cure can be effected. I have from my twelfth\r\nyear onward been practicing, though not excessively, the evil,\r\n_self-abuse._ Although I have been led to abandon the pernicious habit\r\nfor several years, my age being twenty-four, the horrible effects have\r\nnot disappeared. The serious result is that I am suffering from\r\nspermatorrhea. An involuntary discharge of the seminal fluid occurs\r\ninvariably once, not infrequently twice, every week during sleep. The\r\ngenital organs have become diminished in size. I will proceed to state\r\nthe symptoms which I have been able to observe. They are--disposition to\r\nsolitude, inaptitude for study, indolence, forgetfulness, melancholy,\r\nweakness in the back (especially perceptible after standing), a lack of\r\nconfidence in my own ability, want of energy, sometimes pain in the\r\nchest, elbow, arm, knees, and loins. Uneasy nights, disturbed and highly\r\ndisagreeable dreams becoming more and more irritating as the time for\r\nthe discharge of the seminal fluid draws nearer, also a desire to lie\r\nlonger in bed in the morning.\r\n\r\nNow, dear Doctors, permit me to ask your kind advice as to what means\r\nare to be taken. I have tried numerous remedies for more than a year,\r\nbut to no effect. My suffering grows severer. Please reply as speedily\r\nas you may be able. If you be so kind as to honor me with an answer,\r\nplease state the amount of money needed for your services, which shall\r\nbe forwarded at once. Please find inclosed one dollar, remuneration for\r\nyour kind services.\r\n\r\n    Very respectfully,\r\n    M., Wheeling, Cook Co., Ill.\r\n\r\n(At the close of treatment.)\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION: _Gentlemen_--I have finished the\r\neight months' treatment; had I been able to follow the directions more\r\nclosely, three months' treatment would have effected a permanent cure of\r\nmy case. Now I am well, body strengthened, mind invigorated, memory\r\nrevived, energy to work restored, cheerfulness and bright hopes, once\r\naltogether lost, are now fully regained. Indeed, I feel like a new\r\nbeing. And now, dear Doctors, in closing our important correspondence,\r\npermit me to render my heart-felt thanks for your kindness to me, and\r\nfor the benefit received from your invaluable treatment. Adieu; may God\r\ngrant you a long life, that you may benefit many an afflicted one.\r\n\r\n    Very truly yours, M., Wheeling, Cook Co., Ill\r\n\r\n\r\nCASE 464,255. MASTURBATION. LOSS OF FLESH AND MENTAL POWER.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION: _Gentlemen_--After three months\r\nof your treatment, I find myself cured of one of the worst habits that\r\nit has ever been the lot of man to fall into. My whole system is\r\ninvigorated; I have no more weak back nor legs; no more emissions; my\r\nstrength is greatly increased, and my weight is more than it has ever\r\nbeen before. The dull, heavy feeling in my head is entirely past, and I\r\ncan truly say that I feel like a new man. Hoping you will do as much\r\ngood in the future as you have in the past, is the wish of, Yours truly,\r\nB., Holyoke, Mass.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASE 91,656. SPERMATORRHEA. OBSTINATE CASE OF EIGHT YEARS' STANDING.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.: _Gentlemen_--I\r\nhave taken seven months' treatment from you, and to-day I am a well man.\r\nMy friends are surprised at the great change which has taken place in\r\nme. The emissions have ceased entirely, and I am strong and well. I am a\r\nthousand times obliged to you for the good your treatment has done for\r\nme.\r\n\r\n    Respectfully yours, U., Topeka, Kansas.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASE 461,306. ONANISM. MELANCHOLIA; CONTEMPLATED SUICIDE.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION: _Gentlemen_--Having waited\r\nseveral weeks after finishing the last medicine, to see if there would\r\nbe any relapse, I now send you a report of treatment. I believe I am\r\nthoroughly cured, not only of poor health, but of all desire to abuse\r\nmyself. I have regained health, spirits, and confidence. Am married,\r\nsomething I have long desired, but never before dared to attempt. Please\r\naccept my sincere thanks, gentlemen. Your medicine has saved me from a\r\nsuicide's grave.\r\n\r\n    H., Denver, Col.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASE 110,838. SEMINAL WEAKNESS AND FISTULA IN ANO.\r\n\r\nA case of anal fistula that had been unsuccessfully treated by\r\nProf. ----, of Nashville, who had operated with the knife. He had also\r\nbeen unsuccessfully treated by several home physicians who stated that\r\nhis symptoms of spermatorrhea were all that could be described, and more\r\ntoo. The sensations of crawling and itching in the rectum were very\r\nsevere, and as a result of weakness there was a serious palpitation of\r\nthe heart, and general debility. The generative organs were unduly\r\nexcitable and weak. He complained of weakness in the rectum and loins,\r\nwith irregularity of the bowels, trembling and weakness of the entire\r\nsystem. There was profuse discharge from the fistula and also from the\r\nurethra. We undertook his case without making any promises of a radical\r\ncure, as it seemed that the disease had progressed so that it would be\r\nimpossible to effect more than satisfactory improvement in his general\r\ncondition, and a palliation of the symptoms of disease. At the end of\r\nseven months' treatment he writes as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION: _Gentlemen_--The result of the\r\ntreatment you have sent me is a permanent cure of the fistula beyond a\r\ndoubt, and in a magical manner. My heart is very much improved, so that\r\nit does not trouble me in the least. My health is perfect in every way.\r\nIt is unnecessary for me to order any more medicines, but should I think\r\nat any time that a little is required to keep me in good health, I will\r\norder at once. I think that I am entirely through with the fistula and\r\nsympathetic weakness, and I can truly say that your remedies delivered\r\nme from the jaws of death. With sincere thanks to you, I am, yours for\r\never. D.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASE 140,056. SPERMATORRHEA.\r\n\r\nThe following long-standing and aggravated case of seminal debility\r\nbegan to yield at once under the specific influence of our medicines.\r\nFrequent nocturnal emissions were present, and the semen also passed\r\noff, unobserved and unsuspected, in the urine; of course a ceaseless\r\nvital drain of this character began quickly and profoundly to impress\r\nthe constitution, so that when the patient under consideration applied\r\nto us for relief, the most unmistakable symptoms of commencing organic\r\ndisease of the heart and lungs had plainly declared themselves to be\r\npresent. Like many hundreds, of similar cases which we cure annually,\r\nthe disease yielded promptly and perfectly to the well-directed efforts\r\nof our specialist in this important branch of practice; indeed, so easy,\r\nswift and perfect was the cure that the patient failed to realize the\r\nnecessity of continuing the treatment a few weeks in order to insure\r\nhimself against the possibility of a relapse, and discontinued his\r\ncorrespondence with us, whereas it is in precisely such cases that we\r\nrecommend the treatment to be not too abruptly discontinued.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.: _Gentlemen_--Your\r\nkind favor, thoughtfully inquiring after my health, came duly to hand.\r\nIn answer, permit me to say that it was not my intention to take further\r\ntreatment as I considered my cure to be perfect, all local and general\r\nsymptoms having wholly subsided before I had finished the month's\r\ncourse, and thus far manifesting no disposition to return. However, in\r\nthe light of your wisdom and experience, I have reconsidered the matter\r\nand now believe with you that another month's course of treatment is\r\nadvisable, in order effectually to guard against the possibility of a\r\nrelapse. I accordingly inclose you the price of the additional month's\r\ncourse. The second morning after commencing the use of your medicines I\r\nawoke refreshed in body and mind, and this experience has been repeated\r\nevery morning since. The emissions were arrested at once, and I have not\r\nhad a single unnatural discharge since, except once when I experienced a\r\nslight nocturnal emission, which, however, was followed by no depressing\r\nafter-effects, but altogether the reverse. I feel so much stronger and\r\nbetter in all respects that It is a positive pleasure for me to do a\r\nhard day's work now.\r\n\r\n    Respectfully, B., Crystal Lake, Wis.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASE 86,291.\r\n\r\nThis gentleman had suffered during eleven years from seminal weakness as\r\nthe result of indiscretions in youth; nocturnal emissions were present,\r\nand there was also a seminal loss with the urine, and at stool; the\r\npatient's memory was greatly impaired and his mind otherwise affected\r\nfrom the vital drain; he was dyspeptic, his bowels were costive, and\r\nthreatening symptoms of consumption had already begun to manifest\r\nthemselves when he came under our care. Two months of our special\r\ntreatment, at the patient's home, effected a perfect and permanent cure,\r\nand completely arrested all abnormal seminal losses. The following\r\ngrateful letter is from the gentleman in question:\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--Permit me to say that, six months after having discontinued\r\nyour treatment, my cure remains perfect. This great permanent and\r\nenduring benefit was secured to me through only two months of your\r\nskillful treatment and careful management of my case. Your medicines had\r\na wonderful control over my disease, driving away its terrible symptoms\r\nas if by magic; they imparted to me a new power, filled my body and mind\r\nwith unusual vigor, and transformed me from one racked with pain and\r\nliving death or worse, to a full measure of health and happiness. I feel\r\nthat if I had not been opportunely and successfully treated by you, that\r\nmy life would have been permanently blighted, and that the happy and\r\ncontented mind that now inspires these lines would ere this have been\r\ndethroned of reason. I feel that you have been my savior. I have not had\r\na single nocturnal emission since leaving your treatment, six months\r\nago. Thanking you, gentlemen, from the depths of a grateful heart, I\r\nremain.\r\n\r\n    Your obedient servant, G., Cayuta, Schuyler Co., N.Y.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDid the interest of our readers demand it, we could add to the preceding\r\nlist an almost endless number of extracts from letters written by\r\ngrateful patients, expressing their heart-felt thanks for having been\r\ncured of spermatorrhea and impotency by our treatment. But we have we\r\ntrust given sufficient to illustrate our great success in dealing with\r\nthese maladies.\r\n\r\nA CAUTION TO THE AFFLICTED. We are daily consulted by persons suffering\r\nfrom spermatorrhea and impotency who have been victimized by ignorant\r\ncharlatans. Some seek to dupe and swindle the unwary by claiming to have\r\nthemselves been cured of spermatorrhea or impotency by some\r\nprescription, which they offer to send free to any sufferer. When the\r\nprescription is obtained it is found to consist of a few articles\r\nwell-known to every druggist, coupled with certain arbitrary and\r\nfictitious terms, unknown to everybody and not to be found in any\r\nmedical work extant. Following the prescription is a modest suggestion\r\nthat if it cannot be filled by the home druggist, the\r\nbenevolently-disposed party furnishing the prescription will be pleased\r\nto send the medicine, already prepared, for from three to five dollars.\r\nOf course, the whole scheme from beginning to end being a swindle, when\r\nthe \"medicine\" is obtained and taken it proves entirely useless. Skill\r\nand genuine merit do not go begging. Men who spend hundreds of dollars\r\nfor the publication of advertisements offering to give away valuable\r\ninformation can always be safely set down as swindlers.\r\n\r\nIn the public prints will be found advertised various ready prepared,\r\n\"put-up,\" or proprietary, so-called \"remedies,\" \"Specifics,\" \"Boluses,\"\r\n\"Pastiles,\" \"Rectal Pearls,\" \"Urethral Crayons,\" \"Voltaic Belts,\"\r\n\"Galvanic Belts,\" \"Batteries,\" and \"Pads,\" all recommended as infallible\r\nremedies for spermatorrhea and impotency.\r\n\r\nA vast experience in the treatment of these affections has satisfied us\r\nthat each case must be studied and treated according to the symptoms\r\nmanifested, and that medicines that are adapted to one stage of the\r\ndisease are entirely unsuited to other stages of the same case. No \"Pad\"\r\nor \"Battery and Pad,\" \"Galvanic\" or \"Voltaic Belts,\" \"Battery,\" \"Bolus,\"\r\nor \"Soluble Crayon,\" ever did or can help a case of this disease, except\r\nit be in the imagination. Although the proprietors of the most popular\r\nproprietary medicines in the market, medicines carefully adapted to the\r\ncure of the diseases for which they are recommended, yet, should we\r\nattempt to get up a general remedy to cure spermatorrhea and kindred\r\nmaladies, we are certain it would be an utter failure, and this is\r\nentirely true of all such preparations now and heretofore offered for\r\nsale, and, from the very nature of the diseases they are recommended to\r\ncure, ever must be. Each case must have medicines carefully prepared to\r\nmeet the conditions present, and when these conditions, from the effects\r\nof treatment or other causes, change, the treatment must be varied\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\nPOSITIVE INJURY instead of benefit often results from the employment of\r\nsome of the nostrums advertised for the cure of spermatorrhea, impotency\r\nand kindred affections. Especially have we found that the use of\r\n\"Soluble Urethral Crayons,\" \"Boluses,\" \"Pastiles\", and kindred\r\ncontrivances, which are so extensively advertised, are exceedingly\r\ninjurious, and often render otherwise moderate and simple cases,\r\ncomplicated and incurable.\r\n\r\nAlthough of pretended French origin, they are evidently the invention of\r\nan ignoramus, who knows nothing of the delicate anatomy of the\r\ngenerative organs or of the proper treatment of the diseases incident\r\nthereto, for none other would have thought of such a preposterous plan\r\nof treatment. No man should insert such absurdly devised and mischief\r\nbreeding contrivances into his urethra (urinary canal), for thereby he\r\nis almost sure to do himself a permanent injury. So far from having been\r\ninvented by an eminent French surgeon, as claimed, such treatment is\r\nentirely unknown in France, and ever has been, as the writer well knows\r\nfrom personal observation and enquiry while sojourning in that country\r\nand visiting its most noted hospitals and medical institutions.\r\n\r\nAll the various \"Troches,\" \"Boluses,\" \"Wafers,\" \"Suppositories,\"\r\n\"Pearls,\" \"Rectal Pearls,\" \"Rectal Capsules,\" and other contrivances\r\nwhich are recommended for the cure of Spermatorrhea and kindred\r\nweaknesses, and which are designed to be employed by inserting them into\r\nthe lower bowel (rectum), and there permitting them to dissolve, are\r\nonly so many irrational and filthy devices for duping the ignorant and\r\ninnocent sufferers from these maladies.\r\n\r\nAN ALLURING SWINDLE. A still more enticing, and hence more dangerous,\r\ndevice for swindling unfortunate sufferers, is the widely advertised\r\n\"Vacuum Treatment\" or \"appliance\" so loudly and plausibly recommended\r\nfor \"Developing weak and wasted organs.\" A simple, little, brass air\r\npump, connected with a glass tube, or cylinder, fitted with a valve at\r\none end, which costs not to exceed one dollar and a half, is the\r\nworthless device palmed off on the confiding ones _at from fifteen to\r\nthirty dollars_. This is done under the _false pretense_ that its daily\r\nuse to pump blood into the weak or wasted organs, will cause their\r\ndevelopment and growth.\r\n\r\nThousands have invested their hard earned cash in this worse than\r\nworthless, injurious, contrivance. In fact the head of the concern\r\nputting out this alluring device is said to have amassed a fortune out\r\nof the nefarious business.\r\n\r\nSo far from benefiting any one, out of several hundreds of cases that\r\nhave come under our personal observation, in which this apparatus has\r\nbeen faithfully used for a long period of time, we have never met with a\r\nsingle case that had derived the slightest benefit therefrom. On the\r\ncontrary, we have been called upon to examine many who had been\r\n_seriously injured_ by its use.\r\n\r\nThe sudden congestion or filling and over-distention of the delicate\r\nblood-vessels of the organ operated upon, caused by placing it in a\r\nvacuum, is liable to rupture these minute vessels, causing the\r\ninfiltration of blood into the tissues and giving rise to inflammation,\r\nand in some cases, to _suppuration, mortification, sloughing_ and\r\n_death_.\r\n\r\nIn other cases, the blood-vessels of the organ and adjacent parts are\r\nso weakened by the _strain_ put upon them as to induce varicocele and\r\nother diseased conditions. In spermatorrhea, it is the worst possible\r\nthing that can be applied, for by forcing an undue amount of blood into\r\nthe part the sensitiveness of the organ is increased, irritation is set\r\nup in the deep urethra, and the emissions are increased in frequency. In\r\nthis, and other ways, hundreds of men but slightly out of health have\r\nbeen permanently injured.\r\n\r\nBut this is only a small part of the story connected with the\r\nreprehensible business of palming off \"The Vacuum Developing and\r\nStrengthening Appliance.\" The precious rascals, not content with making\r\nfrom a thousand to fifteen hundred per cent. profit on the miserable\r\ndevice furnished, while advertising fifteen dollars ($15.00) as the\r\nprice of the \"appliance\" and \"accompanying preparations,\" for \"_ordinary\r\ncases_,\" make a general practice, when they have secured the fifteen\r\ndollars ($15.00), of sending it by express _with a bill to be collected\r\non delivery_ FOR FIFTEEN DOLLARS ($15.00) MORE. With this bill they send\r\nan explanation, that \"on re-examining the case\" they \"found it\r\nnecessary, or thought it advisable, to send their stronger and more\r\nexpensive preparations and appliances _for the worst cases_ AND SO HAVE\r\nCHARGED FIFTEEN DOLLARS ($15.00) MORE TO COVER THE EXTRA EXPENSE.\"\r\n\r\nIt is astonishing that there are those who can be induced to part with\r\ntheir money for such claptrap devices, and still more so that having\r\nbeen duped and swindled out of their hard earned money through false\r\npretenses and promises of benefit held out to them, they should submit\r\nquietly to such extortion and not have the swindlers arrested and\r\nprosecuted for obtaining money under false pretenses as they richly\r\ndeserve. For what crime can be more deserving of punishment than the\r\nholding out of false hopes and pretenses to the unfortunate? Employing\r\nthe United States mails for swindling is a pretty dangerous business,\r\nand sooner or later these rascals will, we predict, find it out to their\r\nsorrow. They are pretty sure to get hold of some men, ere long, who will\r\ninvoke the aid of the United States District Attorney to bring them to\r\njustice.\r\n\r\nYOUNG MAN, if you have, through ignorance, fallen into practices that\r\nhave arrested your physical growth and development in any of your organs\r\nor parts, shun all such unscientific and worse than worthless\r\ncontrivances as you would shun a pestilence. No matter how plausible the\r\nweb of arguments woven to entrap you, be assured, they are the utterance\r\nof knaves who care not what false hopes they encourage so they secure\r\nyour money.\r\n\r\nConsult only those whose well known skill, experience and integrity will\r\ninsure honest dealings and the most scientific treatment known to the\r\n\"healing art,\" and who supply the latter at reasonable cost.\r\n\r\nBe assured also, that when, through proper treatment, your weakness and\r\nfunctional derangements are overcome, the parts that have suffered\r\ntherefrom, will regain all the strength and development possible to\r\nimpart to them through the aid of the physician's skill. Nature often\r\naccomplishes wonders in this direction, when aided by the skillful\r\npractitioner.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVARICOCELE;\r\n\r\n_OR, ENLARGED VEINS OF THE SCROTUM SOMETIMES CALLED FALSE RUPTURE_\r\n\r\n\r\nProbably no affection of the generative organs has been given more\r\nattention by surgeons than this. Its great frequency, being present in\r\nabout one-third of all cases of spermatorrhea, and its disposition to\r\nresult in impotency and wasting away of the testicles, bring it\r\nconstantly before the profession.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.\r\nA healthy testicle.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.\r\nTesticle wasted from Varicocele.\r\nThe enlarged and\r\ntorturous veins are shown\r\nto be about as large as the\r\ntesticle.]\r\n\r\nCAUSES.--Varicocele commonly results from long continued fatiguing\r\nexercise, in the upright position, heavy lifting, jumping, straining,\r\nsevere constipation, injuries from horseback riding, bicycle riding,\r\nespecially the latter, or any obstruction or obstacle to the free return\r\nof blood through the spermatic veins. Self abuse and excessive sexual\r\nindulgence are also prolific causes of varicocele.\r\n\r\nWhen the spermatic veins are over-distended to such an extent that their\r\ntonicity is impaired, they gradually lose their capacity for\r\ntransmitting the blood, and a slowly increasing enlargement and\r\ntortuously of veins results. This goes on, becoming steadily more\r\nmarked, until the pressure of the engorged vessels upon the spermatic\r\ncord impedes the full circulation of blood in the testicle and causes a\r\nwasting and softening of this gland. A loss of sexual power and\r\nincreasing weakness of the generative organs generally follow this\r\ngradual destruction of the testicle, and sometimes total and incurable\r\nimpotency results.\r\n\r\nThis affection is also designated by the terms _circocele_ and\r\n_spermatocele_. It consists of an enlargement or varicose condition of\r\nthe veins of the scrotum or spermatic cord, and affects the left side\r\nmore frequently than the right. This is due to the fact that the\r\nspermatic veins of that side are longer, more dependent and tortuous,\r\nand, consequently, support a greater column of blood than the other\r\nside. The enlarged veins feel like a bundle of earth-worms. The knotty\r\nand tortuous vessels sometimes form quite a large tumor, which is, now\r\never, but rarely sensitive to the touch, yet sometimes causes a feeling\r\nof weight in the scrotum and loins, and sometimes produces a sensation\r\nof numbness in the thighs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.\r\nWell developed Varicocele.]\r\n\r\nWhen varicocele of an aggravated or largely developed type is present,\r\nassociated with any weakness of the generative organs, as spermatorrhea\r\nor impotency, it must be cured before the organs can regain a healthy\r\ncondition, as by the constant pressure of the abnormal quantity of blood\r\nand enlarged veins upon the spermatic cord, arteries, and testicles, the\r\nirritability, weakness, and wasting, are increased. The use of\r\nsuspensory bandages, with strongly astringent lotions, will, in mild\r\ncases, produce relief and many times cure. Except in the worst cases, it\r\nis well to try these means before resort is had to operative surgical\r\ntreatment, unless the patient is anxious to be cured in a more speedy\r\nmanner. The treatment by suspensory bandage and lotions is necessarily\r\nsomewhat slow in producing remedial results; yet, many quite well marked\r\ncases have, in our experience, been cured by such means perseveringly\r\napplied. Although many who have been unable to come to us for an\r\noperation, have been cured by suspensory bandages and our improved\r\nlotions applied to the affected parts, in all cases in which the veins\r\nare very much enlarged, we recommend the sufferers to come here and\r\nundergo our surgical treatment, which is painless in its execution and\r\nradical in its results.\r\n\r\nIt has been recognized by physicians and surgeons for over a century,\r\nthat in bad cases of varicocele a cure can only be certainly and\r\npermanently effected by operation. Many have been the methods of\r\noperation advanced by the prominent surgeons of every age, but all have\r\nmet with such an alarming mortality, that they have been one by one\r\nabandoned, except as a last resort in extremely bad cases. A late author\r\ngives the percentage of deaths from the various old operations, now in\r\ngeneral use throughout this country and Europe, as varying from seven to\r\nfifteen per cent. of all cases. In contrast to this, we point with pride\r\nto our records, by which we are shown to have operated upon over a\r\nthousand cases by our original method, obtaining in each and every\r\ninstance a perfect cure, without a single alarming symptom or a death\r\nensuing. This we think is sufficient evidence of the perfect safety of\r\nthe operation and its superiority over every other method. So every\r\nsufferer with the disease, we would recommend it as a positive means of\r\nsecuring a permanent cure. Various worse than useless devices are\r\nadvertised by quacks, who, as a class, are afraid to undertake surgical\r\ntreatment for the cure of varicocele. One has what he calls a \"varix\r\nclamp,\" or \"clasp,\" to be worn upon the enlarged veins. Many\r\n\"compressors\" and other equally useless devices are advertised and sold\r\nfor the same purpose. These are not only perfectly worthless, but\r\npositively dangerous in their application. The pressure they make upon\r\nthe spermatic cord, nerves, and artery, is very apt to result in\r\nimpotency and a rapid wasting away of the testicles. Patients should\r\navoid all the catch-penny devices recommended for varicocele, as none of\r\nthem are worth a moment's consideration.\r\n\r\nEven a moderate degree of morbid enlargement of the spermatic veins will\r\nsometimes cause such engorgement and obstruction to the free circulation\r\nof the blood in the testicle, as to cause gradual wasting or shriveling\r\nof that organ. In some cases the morbid condition will give rise to\r\nseminal weakness, or spermatorrhea. Many of these cases that can only be\r\ncured by surgery, are trifled with by quacks, who attribute the\r\nspermatorrhea, or loss of semen, to everything else than its true\r\ncause--varicocele.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate, Mr. B., of Colorado, applied at the Invalids' Hotel and\r\nSurgical Institute, a few years ago, and said he had for five years been\r\ntroubled with nightly emissions of semen and his testicles were\r\ngradually wasting away. He had been under the treatment of men making\r\ngreat pretensions as specialists, to whom he had paid several hundred\r\ndollars in the vain hope of getting cured of spermatorrhea. They treated\r\nhim with medicines only, and did him no good whatever. On examination,\r\nwe found a very varicose or enlarged condition of the left spermatic\r\nveins, and gave it as our opinion that the seminal loss was wholly due\r\nto this abnormal condition and could only be cured by an operation that\r\nwould remove the varicocele. The operation was promptly performed. In\r\ntwo days he was able to leave his bed, and in a week started home to\r\nColorado. Some months thereafter we received a letter from him wherein\r\nhe said: \"The enlarged veins continued to absorb and grow less and less,\r\nuntil, in a few weeks' time, all unnatural enlargement had disappeared.\r\nWith a steady improvement in the condition of the veins, I experienced\r\ncorresponding improvement in my general health, and the seminal losses\r\ngrew less and less, and finally, long ago, disappeared entirely. I feel\r\nthat my manhood, with all the powers that should belong thereto, are\r\nmine to enjoy. In other words, my restoration to health is complete. Had\r\nI saved the large amount of money that I fooled away on those quacks,\r\nand given it all to you, I feel that you would then have been only\r\nfairly paid for the great good you have done me.\"\r\n\r\nThe foregoing is but a fair sample of letters that we are almost\r\nconstantly receiving from those who have pursued useless treatment for\r\nspermatorrhea, dependent upon varicocele, and have been speedily cured\r\nby our never-failing operation for this malady. Among the great variety\r\nof operations in surgery for various diseased conditions, performed by\r\nour surgeons, none have been attended with more uniform satisfaction,\r\nand perfect success, than has our operation for varicocele.\r\n\r\n\r\nA PAINLESS OPERATION.\r\n\r\nBy the injection of a few drops of a medicated solution under the skin,\r\nat the point where the incision is to be made, we are now able to\r\nproduce such complete local anæsthesia as to render the operation\r\n_entirely painless_ without the administration of either chloroform or\r\nether. This is an important consideration, as many are averse to taking\r\nchloroform or ether, and now that we are possessed of an agent that\r\nproduces, locally, _complete insensibility to pain_, we are very glad to\r\nbe able to dispense with their use in all such minor operations. Many\r\nexaminations heretofore very painful, as of the bladder for stone, and\r\nof the deep urethra for strictures, are now rendered _entirely painless_\r\nby the use of this wonderful agent.\r\n\r\nA great variety of surgical operations are now performed by our surgeon\r\nspecialists, without any suffering on the part of our patients, by the\r\nlocal use of an anæsthetic solution injected into the parts to be\r\noperated upon. Formerly we were obliged either to administer chloroform\r\nor ether, or subject our patients to a great deal of suffering. Our\r\nspecialists were among the first surgeons in this country to employ\r\nlocal anæsthesia successfully. We regard it as a great boon to our\r\npatients, and never withhold it in any case where it can be employed to\r\nprevent suffering, its use being attended with no danger and followed by\r\nno bad or disagreeable results.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR PAINLESS OPERATION.\r\n\r\nHaving operated with unvarying success, during the past twenty-five\r\nyears, upon several thousand cases of varicocele, at the Invalids' Hotel\r\nand Surgical Institute, we now invite special attention to the results\r\nof our peculiar operation, which is neither severe nor dangerous, and\r\nfrom which the patient makes a much more rapid, and in every respect\r\nmore satisfactory, recovery than from other operations in use by\r\nsurgeons generally. In our practice we have never failed to secure the\r\nhappiest results from our operation. The saving of time is also of\r\nimportance to the laboring man as well as to the millionaire. Instead of\r\nbeing confined to his bed for ten to twenty days, and to his room for a\r\nmonth or more, as is the case following other operations, the patient is\r\nnot confined to bed at all, and can generally return home in a week or\r\nten days at the longest. The only precaution necessary is that he\r\nshould, for a reasonable time after the operation, wear a well-fitting\r\nsuspensory bandage. This can, in a little time, be entirely dispensed\r\nwith. When we contrast these results with those obtained from ligation,\r\ngraduated pressure by \"clamps,\" suture pins, or the slicing off of a\r\npart of the scrotum, and suturing, or stitching, the wide gaping wound\r\nso caused, as is practiced to-day by other surgeons, the marked\r\nsuperiority of the results obtained, through our superior method of\r\noperating on this affection, must be apparent.\r\n\r\nA very large part of those cured by our treatment have previously spent\r\nfar more money for worthless \"electric suspensories,\" \"equable scrotal\r\ncompressors,\" \"scrotal clamps,\" various \"rings,\" and other \"jim cracks,\"\r\nthan was paid us _for a radical and permanent cure_. Some of these\r\ninstruments are so formidable as to suggest the racks and thumbscrews of\r\nthe middle ages. Such useless appliances often weaken the scrotal\r\nmuscles by the unnatural compression which they produce and make the\r\ndiscomfort far worse when they are discontinued than before their use.\r\n\r\nFor such cases as cannot come to us at once for an immediate and\r\n_perfect cure_, we have a common sense method of treatment,\r\ncomparatively inexpensive, that gives relief and comfort in all cases,\r\nand in mild cases often effects a complete cure. This treatment leaves\r\nthe scrotum and its contents in an improved, strengthened and more\r\nhealthful state.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONIALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the following letters had been written by your nearest, most\r\nrespected and trustworthy neighbors, they could not be entitled to more\r\nconfidence than they now are, coming, as they do, from intelligent\r\ncitizens, each one of whom, in his own neighborhood, enjoys the full\r\nconfidence of all his acquaintances. These letters are taken at random\r\nfrom among hundreds of similar ones, received from former patients of\r\nours, residing in all parts of the United States and Canada, and if it\r\nwould add anything to the endorsement in the way of giving greater\r\nconfidence in our ability to treat successfully the malady under\r\nconsideration, we could multiply the letters which we here introduce\r\nmany times over. To publish more, however, would seem to be tedious\r\nrepetition, for there necessarily must be a sameness in all such letters\r\ntestifying to our skill, and we must, therefore, be content to rest our\r\ncase with the limited number of endorsements which we have room for only\r\nin this volume.\r\n\r\n\r\nVARICOCELE.\r\n\r\nA PERFECTLY PAINLESS OPERATION. PATIENT SMOKES A CIGAR AND TALKS WITH\r\nTHE SURGEONS WHILE OPERATION IS BEING PERFORMED.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A.J. Seth, Esq.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--I suffered with varicocele at the age of nine years, caused\r\nby a fall, and doctored for same about fifteen years, and obtained no\r\nrelief. Renowned surgeons of Pittsburgh, New York, and other cities\r\npronounced my case incurable.\r\n\r\nI heard of the Invalids' Hotel, No. 663 Main Street, Buffalo, N.Y., and\r\nentered it as a last resource. On the third day after entering the\r\nInstitution I was treated, and during the operation (which was a\r\npainless one), I smoked a cigar and talked with the operating surgeons,\r\nfeeling _no pain whatever_. I remained in the Hotel one week, and during\r\nthat time I never once was unable to walk to the elevator and have my\r\nmeals in the dining room. The tables were laden with the best the\r\ncountry can produce. It is truly \"The Invalids' Hotel\" (or rather\r\n_home_), as the clerks and nurses are very kind, attentive and social.\r\n\r\nWill add, that I am permanently cured, and advise any person thus\r\nafflicted not to hesitate entering the Invalids' Hotel for treatment.\r\n\r\n    Respectfully, A.J. SETH,\r\n    Lucinda, Clarion Co., Penna.\r\n\r\n\r\nVARICOCELE.\r\n\r\nFair View, Sanpete Co., Utah.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: W.F. Petts, Esq.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--I feel it my duty to thank you for the benefit I received\r\nat your Institution during the month of December, 1892.\r\n\r\nI was afflicted with varicocele on the left side, which caused me a\r\ngreat deal of trouble and almost made me feel at times that I did not\r\nwant to live any longer if I could not be restored to soundness again.\r\nHearing of your skill in the treatment of varicocele I determined to\r\ngive you a trial, which I accordingly did, and with gratifying results\r\nfor now I am as sound and well as a gold dollar.\r\n\r\nThe operation which was performed on me at your Institution for the\r\npermanent cure of varicocele was, to my great surprise, entirely\r\npainless and performed in a much briefer time than I expected. I only\r\nremained at your noble Institution ten days after the operation, at the\r\nend of which time I returned to my home at Chatham Hill, Smyth Co., Va.\r\nWhen I got home I experienced very little soreness from the operation\r\nand I felt that I could enjoy life fully. About six months after, I got\r\nmarried and came to Utah where I now reside, and I am very much pleased\r\nto say that I am now as sound and well as ever, and very happy in my\r\nmarried state.\r\n\r\nWhen I went to your Institution I was surprised to see such a great\r\nnumber of young men from almost every State in the Union, who had come\r\nthere to be operated upon for varicocele; and they all told me that the\r\noperation was painless to them, as it also was to me, and they said they\r\nwere fast improving and were glad they had come there for treatment. I\r\nnever experienced such great and unprecedented kindness as I did during\r\nthe ten days I was at the \"Invalids' Hotel.\" I had an excellent\r\nroom--well furnished, plenty to eat, and was treated with the kindness\r\nof a mother by the nurses and attending physician.\r\n\r\nI advise all who are afflicted with varicocele to go to your Institution\r\nat once for an operation, which I assure them they will never regret.\r\nTrusting that those who require an operation of any kind, or who are\r\nafflicted in any way, may go to your Institution and be restored to\r\nhealth, and again thanking you for my restoration to health and YOUR\r\ngreat kindness and good treatment of me while I was with you, I remain,\r\n\r\n    Yours very truly,\r\n    William F. Petts\r\n\r\nP.S.--My sister's life was saved by your \"Favorite Prescription,\" W.F.P.\r\n\r\n\r\nVARICOCELE.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A. Ebsary, Esq.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--It is with great pleasure I recommend those suffering from\r\nvaricocele to your skillful hands. I suffered with varicocele for seven\r\nyears, caused by standing behind the counter at business from seven in\r\nthe morning until ten and twelve o'clock at night.\r\n\r\nIn 1888 a friend gave me a copy of your Common Sense Medical Adviser.\r\nAfter perusing its pages I was convinced of the genuineness of its\r\ndoctrine. I immediately started for Buffalo--a distance of 1,900 miles.\r\nDuring my stay of ten days at your Institution I was treated with the\r\nutmost kindness by the nurses and surgeons, all of whom are expert\r\nspecialists.\r\n\r\nThe equipment of the Institution is something immense. I often think of\r\nthe appetite those healthy exercises in the treatment room gave me when\r\ndinner time came.\r\n\r\nAfter being in the Institution three days I underwent an operation for\r\nvaricocele--an injection of medicine locally making the operation\r\n_absolutely free from pain_. The operation was performed in about thirty\r\nminutes, immediately after which I could walk to my room, and, after\r\nresting an hour, descended to the dining room and took my dinner as\r\nusual.\r\n\r\nWhile at the Institution I met numerous persons suffering from\r\nvaricocele, and it was quite pleasing to contrast their happy looks as\r\nthey wished you \"goodbye\" with the haggard appearance they had upon\r\nentering.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the Institution I traveled about 1,400 miles by rail and\r\n500 miles by water without the least inconvenience, which I consider a\r\nfair test of the operation.\r\n\r\nFive years have passed since that time, and I now feel as sound as it is\r\npossible to feel.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, let me say to those suffering from varicocele that it is\r\nimpossible for them to do better than follow my example.\r\n\r\n    Respectfully yours, ARTHUR EBSARY,\r\n    (Care of Hon. Jas. Baird.) Water Street, St. John's, Newfoundland.\r\n\r\n\r\nVARICOCELE.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: F.H. Jenkins, Esq.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--I am a carpenter and some years ago, I fell from a scaffold\r\nwhich in time almost killed me. I wasn't hurt very much at the time, but\r\na dull aching pain seemed to take me in the left side of the scrotum,\r\nand after I could stand it no longer, I went to my doctor. He said that\r\nI had a rupture of the blood veins of the left testicle, and it was\r\nincurable. I gave up in despair; but at last, a friend handed me some of\r\nyour advertising papers, and I saw the Common Sense Medical Adviser\r\nadvertised and sent for the book and studied its contents carefully, and\r\ncame to the conclusion that I was suffering from varicocele. I found on\r\nconsulting you that my suspicions were right. I at once wrote you for\r\nparticulars, and in less than a week I was at the Invalids' Hotel for\r\ntreatment. At that time no one knows how I suffered; but I hadn't long\r\nto suffer. In ten days after _an entirely painless operation_ I was a\r\nwell man and returned home.\r\n\r\nI cannot say too much in regard to the treatment and care from both\r\nSurgeons and Nurses. Nothing was left undone to promote comfort and good\r\ncare. It is the only place on earth that I would feel safe to trust my\r\nlife for a severe operation. There were, I think, over 100 patients at\r\nthe Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute, at the time I was there, and\r\nas I had a good chance to be with them, I found that they were all doing\r\nremarkably well.\r\n\r\nAt the date of my operation which was the 7th of March, 1893, I weighed\r\njust 165 pounds; to-day I weigh 189. I have gained in health, strength\r\nand vigor every day, I believe.\r\n\r\nI would just say, in conclusion, that I can give my word as an honest\r\nman to any sufferer that I believe he can be cured of almost any chronic\r\nmalady at the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute.\r\n\r\n    Respectfully yours,\r\n    F.H. JENKINS,\r\n    (Box 13), Ascot Corner, Sherbrooke Co., P.Q., Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\nVARICOCELE.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: R.C.

Buffalo, N.Y., for the radical cure of a varicocele\r\nof the left side from which I had suffered for four years, I take\r\npleasure in certifying to the speedy and certain relief afforded me, and\r\nthe painless nature of the operation, as performed by the surgeons of\r\nthe World's Dispensary Medical Association. Fourteen days from the time\r\nof the operation I returned home cured, and went to work. I desire to\r\nexpress my thanks to the Medical Staff for their skill and attention. I\r\nmet several patients while at the Sanitarium, and they all reported as\r\ngetting along favorably and well. Respectfully,\r\n\r\n    R.C.

Dove, Esq.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--I can heartily say that the operation was a great success.\r\nI had rupture of the veins, or Varicocele, ten years. I never thought\r\nthat I could be cured so easily. The operation was entirely painless,\r\nand I was only nine days away from home. I am now as well as ever and I\r\nrecommend the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute to any one who is\r\nsuffering from any chronic disease. Yours,\r\n\r\n    CHARLES DOVE,\r\n    33 John St., Wilkes Barre, Pa.\r\n\r\n\r\nVARICOCELE.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: J.F. Singrey, Esq.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--I was successfully treated for varicocele at the Invalids'\r\nHotel. The operation was made painless by local application, previously\r\napplied, which made the parts insensible, and I returned home the ninth\r\nday. While there I met with patients from all parts of the country, and\r\nall spoke in the highest terms of the treatment received from the\r\nsurgeons and nurses and all connected with the Institution.\r\n\r\n    Yours respectfully, J.F.

SMITH, ESQ.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--I feel very thankful to the Association for the benefit\r\nreceived--due to an operation performed for the cure of a varicocele of\r\nmany years' standing. All traces of the disease have disappeared. I was\r\nsurprised to know that so little pain was connected with the operation.\r\n\r\nWill say to those who think of visiting the Invalids' Hotel, that they\r\nwill be treated well, and their visit will be made as pleasant as\r\npossible during their stay.\r\n\r\n    Yours respectfully,\r\n    HENRY P.

Time of stay,\r\nafter operation, was ten days. I cannot speak too highly of the care and\r\nattention I received from the surgeons and nurses while there;\r\neverything that was provided was of the best--the best of food, clean\r\napartments and pleasant rooms.\r\n\r\nI would recommend your Institution to any one suffering from any kind of\r\nchronic or surgical disease; and if they will only go to your\r\nInstitution, they will meet with patients cured and others on the way to\r\nrecovery from the same difficulty they have themselves--no matter what\r\nit is, if curable at all. I wish you success,\r\n\r\n    Yours truly, GEORGE R.

This operation was performed by one of your specialists in a\r\nskillful and painless manner.\r\n\r\nI found the Invalids' Hotel just what it is represented to be, and all\r\npatients who were there were well satisfied with the treatment.\r\n\r\nI was not confined to bed at all after the operation, and was able to\r\nleave at the end of ten days in an excellent condition.\r\n\r\nI am unable to express the great relief which your treatment has given\r\nme and I cannot say too much in praise of your Institution.\r\n\r\nI take great pleasure in recommending you whenever I get a chance, and\r\ncannot thank you enough for what you have done for me. With kindest\r\nregards,\r\n\r\n    I am sincerely yours,\r\n    B.T. STONE,\r\n    Fellowsville, Preston Co., W.

Your Institution is the best of the kind that I have ever seen\r\nand if it is possible for a person to be cured your specialists will\r\naccomplish it. A visit there convinced me that you do not make promises\r\nwhich you do not fulfill. After being there and having a surgical\r\noperation successfully performed, I heartily recommend all invalids to\r\ngive your place a trial. Much to my surprise the operation which was\r\nperformed was perfectly painless, no anæsthetic was given, and I was not\r\nconfined to my bed for an hour. I was able to leave your Institution at\r\nthe end of ten days completely cured. I can heartily commend your\r\nefforts in the cause of suffering humanity, and shall be pleased to\r\noffer my personal testimony at any time. With best wishes to the World's\r\nDispensary Medical Association, I am,\r\n\r\n    Sincerely yours,\r\n    C.W. KELLY,\r\n    Riverside, Riverside Co., Cal.\r\n\r\n\r\nVARICOCELE. THE RESULT OF INJURY.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: C.F.L. DeHaven, Esq.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--Nine years ago I was struck with a springing pole, causing\r\nthe spermatic cord to swell badly. I applied for medical aid and was\r\ntold that no harm would result. But I grew worse, and spent over one\r\nhundred dollars with quacks and received no help.\r\n\r\nFour years ago while reading a chapter in Dr. Pierce's Common Sense\r\nMedical Adviser, I noticed that no hesitation was made in stating that a\r\npermanent and radical cure of varicocele could be made at the Invalids'\r\nHotel and Surgical Institute. I went to the Hotel and the result was I\r\nreturned home in eleven days permanently cured. I cannot speak in too\r\nhigh praise of the surgeon, and his delicacy and kindness in performing\r\na painless operation; or of the nurses, who almost hourly visit the\r\ninvalids and minister to their comfort. The Institution is fully\r\nequipped and nothing is left undone that can relieve suffering. I\r\nconversed with a great many patients while at the Invalids' Hotel and\r\nlanguage could not express their delight at their treatment there.\r\n\r\nI earnestly urge all invalids to save time and suffering by being\r\ntreated at the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute where the latest\r\nand most improved methods are used, and operations are made painless and\r\nwhere everything is delightful and comfortable. I owe my life to the\r\ntenderness and skill of the surgeon and nurses at the Invalids' Hotel\r\nand Surgical Institute.\r\n\r\n    Very truly yours, CLARENCE F.L. DEHAVEN,\r\n    Haynes, Hocking Co., Ohio.\r\n\r\n\r\nVARICOCELE.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: F. Brooks, Esq.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--I can say that while in your Institution I received the\r\nbest of care and attention both by doctors and nurses; that your\r\noperation was almost entirely without pain; that my virility has\r\nincreased since then as well as the tone of my general health; that your\r\nInstitution is as commodious and cheerful as one could wish. Your\r\npatients with whom I became acquainted while there nearly all seemed to\r\nbe well pleased with the ease and comfort of their surroundings as well\r\nas the manner in which they were treated for varicocele.\r\n\r\n    Respectfully,\r\n    FLAVIUS BROOKS,\r\n    Sinnamahoning, Cameron Co., Pa.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAD VARICOCELE OF MANY YEARS' STANDING.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: D.E.

Some four years ago\r\nI was there and had an operation performed on me for a very bad\r\nvaricocele with which I had been troubled some 15 or 20 years. The\r\noperation was made painless by the use of local applications. After\r\nstaying at your place about twenty days (longer than is generally\r\nnecessary) I was able to make my long trip home. The operation was a\r\nvery successful one, considering the long time my trouble had been\r\nneglected, as I have suffered little or no inconvenience since. I saw a\r\nvery large number of patients at the Invalids' Hotel from all parts of\r\nthe United States and Canada, and all of them seemed to have a very high\r\nopinion of the treatment they were receiving from your Specialists, and\r\nI know personally, of several remarkably successful operations performed\r\nby your skillful surgeons while I was there.\r\n\r\n    Respectfully, D.E. MOOREFIEID,\r\n    Nathalie, Halifax Co., Va.\r\n\r\n\r\nVARICOCELE.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: D.H. Miller, Esq.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--Having been operated upon at the Invalids' Hotel and\r\nSurgical Institute for the cure of Varicocele, which was caused from\r\nheavy lifting, I take pleasure in informing you that it is entirely\r\ncured; it was a varicocele of a number of years' standing and a bad\r\ncase. It has been three years since I was operated upon and I have not\r\nexperienced any trouble from it since; in fact, I feel that I am now\r\nentirely cured. _The operation is painless_ and gives entire\r\nsatisfaction in every respect.\r\n\r\nI advise all who are suffering from this or any other chronic disease to\r\ntake treatment at the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute and they\r\nwill be well rewarded by so doing.\r\n\r\n    Yours respectfully,\r\n    DAVID H.

N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--I can bear testimony to the removal of the difficulty for\r\nwhich you treated me, for I had been to experts in Philadelphia and they\r\ndid not know how to perform the operation, and said I could not be\r\ncured. I was treated by experts in Albany and other cities, but all for\r\nno use. I went to the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute and was\r\noperated upon and find I am cured. The treatment in every other respect\r\nwas good; everything was done to make patients happy and pleasant; the\r\nbest of care and attention was paid to all.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly,\r\n    W.

Ten days from the time of the\r\noperation, I returned home radically and permanently cured. I desire to\r\nexpress my thanks to the medical staff for their skill and attention.\r\n\r\n    Gratefully yours,\r\n    N.H. SHARITZ,\r\n    Box 22.

Wills, Esq.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--I am unable to find words to express my feelings of\r\ngratefulness and gratitude that I owe to your Institution, for the able\r\nand gentlemanly treatment that I was favored with during my stay with\r\nyou, by officials and attendants in their respective capacities, in\r\nevery department. Nothing was left undone that could possibly be of\r\nbenefit to me or add to my comfort, and to your Institution, your\r\ntreatment, which in my own experience I have found to be marvelously\r\nwonderful, I feel to-day as if I owe my health, my strength, my life;\r\nfor I firmly believe if it had not been for your timely and painless\r\ntreatment, instead of writing to you at this time, being in the\r\nenjoyment of health and strength, I would be filling a place in an\r\ninsane asylum or an invalid's grave. And it may not be more than just to\r\nyour wonderful treatment to say that the Varicocele and resultant\r\nweaknesses was of about fifteen years' standing, during which time I had\r\nspent time and money with both physicians and quacks, without any result\r\nfor the better, and when my life blood was daily wasting away, and the\r\npowers of manly strength and vigor were completely gone, by an act of\r\nProvidence I went to your Institution as a last resort, for life or\r\ndeath. I was painlessly operated upon by you for my complaint, from\r\nwhich time I have steadily improved in health, strength, weight and\r\nvigor, until I have gone from 135 pounds, my weight when operated upon,\r\nto 174, at which I tip the balance as I write to you to-day. If the\r\nafflicted everywhere could only realize that so many lives may be spared\r\nby your wonderful treatment, none would stay away.\r\n\r\nYou are at liberty to give my testimony to the world in whatever way it\r\nmay be of most benefit to you. I also enclose a photograph of myself\r\nthat has been taken since the effects of your treatment have been shown.\r\nWith feelings of much gratefulness, I am,\r\n\r\n    Very truly yours,\r\n    ROBERT B.

P. Morse, Esq.]\r\n\r\n\"WHAT I THINK OF THE INVALIDS' HOTEL AND SURGICAL INSTITUTE:\"\r\n\r\nThe Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute is an Institution first-class\r\nin every respect, presided over by a capable, honest and pleasant lot of\r\nmedical experts who certainly know their business. I cannot speak of it\r\ntoo highly.\r\n\r\nI was treated there in the summer of 1887, for Rupture of the Spermatic\r\nVeins, previous to which I had been operated on two different times,\r\nwith no relief, by a doctor here in this place cracked up to be one of\r\nthe best in Northern Illinois, and an officer of the Chicago Eye and Ear\r\nInfirmary. The operation at the Invalids' Hotel was perfectly painless,\r\ndid not have to take any anæsthetic, neither was I confined to my bed at\r\nall, and the result a perfect success; while in the two previous\r\noperations I had here at home, I was confined to my bed a week each time\r\nand another week scarcely able to move about, be sides getting worse\r\neach time with pain enough to drive one crazy. But the half has not been\r\ntold. About two and a half years after I had been cured of my difficulty\r\nat Buffalo, I commenced having terrible pains in my leg and abdomen, for\r\nwhich I could not account, and after standing it until it seemed as\r\nthough I would be glad to die, I again consulted the Invalids' Hotel;\r\nafter a thorough investigation they operated on me where my pain seemed\r\nthe most apparent, and dug out a piece of a surgeon's needle something\r\nover half an inch in length, that had been broken off in the first\r\noperation I had by the doctor here at home, and so admitted by him when\r\nconfronted with it. I have spent lots of money and nearly six years of\r\nthe worst pain man ever stood getting relief, while had I known of this\r\nplace on the start, an operation with no pain whatever and scarcely more\r\ndiscomfort than a sore mouth after having a tooth removed, would have\r\nended it all.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I will say to any poor sufferer, don't do as I did and\r\nput your trust in the would-be greatest doctor you have at home, but go\r\nto this place at Buffalo, where you will have proof of their ability,\r\nand where you will surely meet patients about to leave, cured; others on\r\ntheir way to recovery for the same difficulty you may have yourself, no\r\nmatter what it is, if curable at all; a place where you will have the\r\nkindest of attention, the best of medical and surgical skill, and where\r\nyou can see sufferers going away every day with hearts full of gratitude\r\nand happy.\r\n\r\n    Respectfully, CHAS. P. MORSE,\r\n    311 North Avon St., Rockford, Ills.\r\n\r\n\r\nVARICOCELE-FALSE RUPTURE CAUSED BY INJURY.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: G.W. McCollom, Esq.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--In the year 1866, sometime in July, I jumped from a load of\r\nlumber to the ground, and at once felt a sharp severe pain along the\r\nspermatic cord of left side of scrotum, preventing my walking to the\r\nhouse without help. The veins near the cord filled to such extent that\r\nthey seemed solid, and could not be reduced for some time. I went to a\r\ngood doctor and by him was advised to \"pay no attention to it, it will\r\nnot amount to much.\" From that time I suffered continually, and will not\r\ntry to describe what I endured until I was relieved by a surgical\r\noperation performed on me by the surgeon-specialist of the Invalids'\r\nHotel and Surgical Institute, of Buffalo, N.Y. After working-hard for\r\nseveral years my suffering increased and I was advised to consult Prof.\r\nL., of Chicago Hahnemann College (of Homeopathic School) and by him was\r\ninformed an operation of tieing the veins (choking them off) could be\r\nperformed but 90 per cent (if I remember rightly) of the operations\r\nproved fatal. I decided not to try it. By accident I learned of your\r\ngreat skill, and though my case was of twenty-one years' time, and my\r\nhealth and strength gone, I considered the method plausible and\r\nreasonably safe. I had the operation performed, and now after six years\r\nhave passed, I can say with satisfaction, there is little to be noticed\r\nor remind me of the past years of misery. The parts are of\r\nhealthy-color. Urine has assumed a natural appearance, both sides of\r\nscrotum seem in size alike. No bandage is worn and for two years has\r\nbeen discarded. My weight increased and for two years prior to the\r\ntaking of my photo, I did the work of handling a third-class post\r\noffice, doing a money order business of $50,000, not losing a day in\r\nthat time, and at the present time in this hot climate, I have been\r\ndoing outdoor work, some of it hard, and with mercury at 100 degrees. I\r\nhave worked and found no need of a bandage; and no unnatural relaxation\r\nof the scrotum or veins is noticed.\r\n\r\nIf anyone wishes to write me, they are at liberty to do so. If my\r\nexperience can be of benefit to any, I will answer all enquiries, and in\r\na general way will now say no one should delay attending to such\r\ndifficulty, for if the blood is in a reasonably healthy condition your\r\nsurgeon will operate in such a way that the result will be all right in\r\ntime. I send photo taken in 1891.\r\n\r\n    Respectfully, GEORGE W. McCOLLOM,\r\n    Monrovia, Los Angeles Co., Cal.\r\n\r\n\r\nVARICOCELE.\r\n\r\nSanborn, Barnes Co., N.

Buffalo. N.Y., I went there and was operated upon. The operation\r\nitself is nothing to bear. It is painless and the result is a radical\r\ncure. For this you have my sincere thanks. I take pleasure in\r\nrecommending your Institution to all sufferers and know that it is in\r\nevery respect just as claimed to be. I would say to all who suffer from\r\nthis trouble: go to the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute, at\r\nBuffalo, N.Y., and you will get relief. You will receive kind attention\r\nfrom all.\r\n\r\n    Very truly yours,\r\n    George Bignall.\r\n\r\n\r\nVARICOCELE AND GENERAL DEBILITY.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: J.L. Ridings, Esq.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--I can bear testimony to the removal of varicocele, for\r\nwhich you treated me. I had been in the habit of getting out with the\r\nboys and trying to see which could kick the highest with one foot on the\r\nground, and it caused me to have varicocele. I went to my home doctor\r\nand he treated me with no success. It was getting worse all the time and\r\nI got out of shape all over. My health got bad and I thought my case\r\nhopeless. I had tried two doctors and received no benefit.\r\n\r\nI had one of your little Memorandum Books in my pocket, and one day,\r\nlooking through it I saw you treated such cases, and wrote you and\r\nreceived word in a few days that you would treat me, so I sent off for\r\none month's treatment; and in five months I had gained my weight back,\r\nand that was eight years ago and I feel sound and well and my health has\r\nbeen good ever since.\r\n\r\nYou are at liberty to use my testimony in whatever way if may be of most\r\nbenefit to you.\r\n\r\nI also enclose a photograph of myself that was taken soon after your\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nWith feelings of much gratefulness, I am,\r\n\r\n    Very truly yours,\r\n    J.L. RIDINGS,\r\n    Clarence, Shelby County, Missouri.\r\n\r\n\r\nVARICOCELE AND NERVOUS DEBILITY.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: D.A. Walton, Esq.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--I commenced treatment, I think, in July or August, of 1888,\r\nand continued four months. My case was nervous debility of fifteen\r\nyears' standing.\r\n\r\nI tried home doctors but found they were only aggravating my case. I\r\nalso tried the Remedy Company, then of St. Louis, who claimed to perform\r\nwonderful cures with their \"Pastiles,\" but they proved utterly\r\nworthless. Having come in possession of Dr. Pierce's little book and\r\ncirculars, a perusal of the same convinced me that my health would not\r\nbe trifled with at his Institution.\r\n\r\nI was a poor man and could not afford much experimenting. I ordered one\r\nmonth's treatment, and at the end of this first month, I found, to my\r\nsurprise, that I was feeling different. The second month, still more\r\nsurprised at my returning health. Third month thought I was cured, and\r\nengaged myself to a young lady, and wrote you to that effect, and you\r\nadvised me with your congratulations to marry, and to order another\r\nmonth's treatment; and at the end of the fourth month I was a _man_,\r\nsomething I did not know what it would be like to be before.\r\n\r\nI have now been married five years, and have two healthy children--a boy\r\nand a girl. I would never have dared to marry had it not been for your\r\nmedicines. I must add that during this treatment I was troubled with\r\nvaricocele on left side. I wrote you this at third month of treatment,\r\nand you sent without extra charge, a Suspensory and Lotion, and two\r\nmonths' treatment cured me sound and well of this distressing malady; I\r\nhave not felt the least symptoms of its return.\r\n\r\nI want the world to know what a competent and honorable firm the World's\r\nDispensary Medical Association is. I would love to shake you by the\r\nhand. May God let you continue to be a help to mankind is my prayer.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly,\r\n    D.A.

I was\r\nsurprised to find such a speedy cure of such a bad case of varicocele of\r\nlong standing; the operation was entirely painless and I felt a great\r\nchange in myself, as a result of it. Am so glad to tell any sufferer of\r\nthat terrible disease to apply to you at once and be cured, for I am\r\nsure I could not have lived long as the pressure and burden was so great\r\n_I could scarcely be on my feet at all_; any work in an upright position\r\nwas impossible.\r\n\r\nNow it has been five years since I was operated upon and I feel well of\r\nthat disease--varicocele attended with impotency or weakness of the\r\ngenerative organs, caused by varicocele.\r\n\r\nThanks to the good physician who relieved me--hope he may live long and\r\nbe able to relieve all that submit themselves to him for treatment, as I\r\ndid.

They are gentlemen in every way and the\r\nInvalids' Hotel is just as represented.\r\n\r\nI shall advise all suffering from chronic diseases to go to you for\r\nrelief, as I have never seen any one there who was not cured or greatly\r\nbenefited.\r\n\r\n    Very truly yours,\r\n    CHRISTIAN HANSON,\r\n    Austin, Mower Co., Minn.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIGESTION, CONSTIPATION, VARICOCELE.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mr. Hodges.]\r\n\r\n_Dear Sirs_--In regard to my condition of health, will say, although I\r\nam not entirely well, yet I have received much and lasting good from\r\nyour treatment. My digestion was improved greatly, so that little\r\ntrouble is experienced after eating; my liver seems to act reasonably\r\nwell, and my bowels are much better. My varicocele I consider entirely\r\ncured, as I have not used the bandage for one half day for more than six\r\nmonths, and do not experience any inconvenience from that source.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly,\r\n    HARLAN HODGES,\r\n    Keota, Keokuk Co., Ia.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAD VARICOCELE.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: W.H.

I was troubled ten\r\nyears with this annoying disease, caused, I think, by being thrown from\r\na horse. My case was of a very obstinate character. I was treated by a\r\nleading specialist of Omaha, Nebr., without success and without being in\r\nthe least benefited. I expended the neat little sum of $500, and then\r\nsank back in despair, losing all hopes of a cure. I had previous to my\r\ntreatment in Omaha noticed a little hand or Memorandum Book of the\r\nWorld's Dispensary, and again one came to my notice. I mustered up\r\ncourage to write to you, and in June, 1892, I visited your Institute for\r\ntreatment. I was treated by the best skilled surgeons and given best\r\nattention by experienced nurses. I met a number of patients while under\r\ntreatment troubled with various and complex diseases, who expressed\r\ntheir gratitude to the Faculty of the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical\r\nInstitute. The operation performed was rendered painless, owing to local\r\napplications previously applied. After the operation, which was about 11\r\no'clock, A.M., I rested until 12, noon, and responded to the dinner call\r\nas usual. I was required to remain but ten days, then returned home, a\r\ndistance of some twelve hundred miles. I wore a neat fitting support for\r\nabout six months, and then abandoned it and have gone as nature created\r\nme. Oh, what a relief. I had worn a \"suspensory\" for about six years. I\r\nhave had no return of former trouble, it being now about two years since\r\nthe operation.\r\n\r\nTo any suffering with varicocele I must say, \"don't delay, but place\r\nyourself under treatment at the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute,\r\nBuffalo, N.Y., and you will say as I do, 'The half has never been\r\ntold.'\" With earnest wishes for your future success, I am,\r\n\r\n    Yours truly,\r\n    E.L.

I\r\nsuffered for about two years previous to the operation with acute pain\r\nin the parts, and continued mental anxiety. I desire to express my\r\nentire satisfaction that, during the ten days that I remained in the\r\nInvalids' Hotel, I never experienced such uniform kindness and attention\r\nas I did from the attending surgeon and from all the attachees, and that\r\nI recommend all persons similarly afflicted to consult you, and they can\r\nbe sure to find the way to happiness.\r\n\r\n    Respectfully yours,\r\n    D.E.

After trying my home physicians without\r\nobtaining any permanent relief, and growing constantly worse, I went to\r\nthis famous Institution and submitted to an operation for varicocele.\r\nThis was a perfect success, and soon I felt like a new man, and as\r\nstrong as I ever did. I feel that nothing I could say would do justice\r\nto this renowned Institution. In every way, it is kept in advance of the\r\nage.

The complaint troubled me exceedingly. I tried almost every\r\nknown means to effect a cure, but with no avail, for the more I doctored\r\nthe more aggravated became the disease. After thus suffering for many\r\nyears and knowing of the fame your Institution had attained in curing\r\nsuch diseases, I at last consulted your specialist in that class of\r\ndiseases--was operated upon and returned home in ten days, a sound and\r\nwell man. I can recommend your Institution to all suffering humanity as\r\nthe most home-like, your nurses the most attentive and specialists the\r\nmost skillful the world can offer. May you long be the benefactors of\r\nmankind.\"\r\n\r\n    Yours truly,\r\n    F.L.

Bankston]\r\n\r\nThis is to certify that I took treatment at the Invalids' Hotel and\r\nSurgical Institute, Buffalo, N.Y., and I was cured of a chronic trouble\r\nthat had been maltreated by other physicians. While there I saw a man\r\nwho had been cured by the specialists, who had before been given up to\r\ndie by the best doctors in Troy, N.Y. Of course, the case must have been\r\na very stubborn one. I afterwards saw a man here, in Georgia, die, who,\r\nif he had been in Pierce's Surgical Institute under the treatment and\r\ncare of his skilled doctors and nurses, I know would have most assuredly\r\ngot well. Why? Because it was only a cage of _stone in the bladder_, and\r\nthey are easily cured at Dr. Pierce's Surgical Institute. I think almost\r\nany chronic disease can be cured there, if taken in time, judging from\r\nmy observations while an inmate of that Institution.\r\n\r\n    H.E.

It may affect either one\r\nor both sides. In health the sac-like covering, or investing membrane,\r\nof the testicle secretes a limpid fluid which lubricates its inner\r\nsurface. When secreted in excess, it accumulates and constitutes\r\n_hydrocele_.\r\n\r\nThe tumor commences at the bottom of the scrotum and grows very\r\ngradually, while hernia, or rupture, with which it is often confounded,\r\nprogresses from above downwards and makes its appearance suddenly.\r\n\r\nWe were recently consulted by an aged gentlemen, whose disease a\r\ndistinguished surgeon had pronounced _double hernia_. On examining the\r\nenlargement, we found the disease to be dropsy of the scrotum,\r\ncomplicated with varicocele.\r\n\r\nCAUSES. Injuries from blows or bruises are among the most common causes\r\nof this disease. It may also result from inflammation of the testicle or\r\nfrom excited action in those parts. It has been known to result from\r\nstricture of the urethra, or water-passage, and also from local\r\nirritation along that passage.\r\n\r\n\r\nHYDROCELE.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: H.H.

I desire to express my thanks to the Medical\r\nStuff for their skillful treatment of my case.

After I had suffered much from other surgeons without\r\nany cure being effected, and with only relief for a short time, you\r\nperformed a not only painless but very scientific operation, and with\r\nmedicine completed the cure. It is now five years since you treated me\r\nand no symptoms of the disease have shown themselves. I will also add\r\nthat while with you at the Invalids' Hotel I received the best of care\r\nand attention from the well trained nurses in your employ, for all of\r\nwhich I feel grateful.\r\n\r\n    With respect and best wishes,\r\n    EDWIN L. WATERS,\r\n    Athol Centre, Mass.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE URINARY ORGANS:\r\n\r\nTHEIR ANATOMY, PHYSIOLOGY AND PATHOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy reference to Fig. 1 the reader will get a good understanding of the\r\nrelative positions of the kidneys, bladder, and adjacent organs.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KIDNEYS.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to discuss the minute structure of these organs\r\nin a book intended for the non-professional reader.\r\n\r\nThe function of the kidneys is to remove certain waste materials from\r\nthe blood. As fast as excreted by the kidneys, the urine passes through\r\nthe ureters, of which there are two,--one leading from each kidney, into\r\nthe bladder. The ureters are lined with a continuation of the mucous\r\nmembrane, reflected from the bladder upwards, and this lining also\r\nextends to the cavities of the kidneys.\r\n\r\nCalculi or gravel, and stones, forming, as they sometimes do, in the\r\nkidneys, and passing down through these delicate and sensitive canals,\r\ncause excruciating pain. The symptoms of renal calculi passing from a\r\nkidney to the bladder are, as already indicated, severe cutting pain in\r\nthe loins, and along the ureter, attended with considerable fever. A\r\nvery rough stone, such, for instance, as a mulberry calculus, passes\r\nwith considerable difficulty, and the patient is often suddenly seized\r\nwith excruciating agony in the loins and in the groin, the pain also\r\nshooting down into the testicle of the corresponding side, often causing\r\nit to retract. There is usually, also, sympathetic pain shooting down\r\nthe thigh. We have seen patients roll on the floor in the greatest\r\nagony, cold sweat meanwhile pouring down their faces, when thus\r\nsuffering. The patient may also vomit violently, through nervous\r\nsympathy. The urine is apt to be bloody, and there is a constant desire\r\nto pass it. There is pain in the end of the penis, and also in the lower\r\nportion of the abdomen.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BLADDER.\r\n\r\nThis is a sac, or reservoir, to receive and hold the urine as it comes\r\nfrom the kidneys through the ureters. Its walls are partly composed of\r\nmuscle, and partly of a lining mucous membrane. The muscular coating is\r\nexternal, and it is by its contraction that the urine is expelled. When\r\nempty, the bladder shrinks down to a small size, as compared with its\r\ndistended condition. When filled, it is capable of holding about one\r\npint. If it is distended by the retention of urine much beyond this\r\ncapacity, the muscular coats lose their force, and often the urine\r\ncannot be passed naturally. In health, when the bladder becomes filled\r\nand distended, there is a consequent desire to empty it by passing\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\nThe voiding of the urine should not be attended with the slightest pain\r\nor disagreeable sensations, and the desire to pass it should not be\r\nfrequent. When there is frequent desire to pass it, or when its passage\r\nis attended with pain, there is irritation, or inflammation, in the\r\ncoats of the bladder, or in the urethra. This may arise from an\r\nexcessively acid or irritating condition of the urine, as well as from\r\nvarious other causes. Gonorrhea, or clap; stricture of the urethra,\r\nwhich impedes the free flow of the urine; enlargement or inflammation of\r\nthe prostate gland; gravel, and stone in the bladder, are all capable of\r\ncreating a frequent desire to pass water. Whatever the unhealthy\r\ncondition may be which gives rise to this troublesome symptom, it calls\r\nfor prompt and skillful treatment, for the most trivial affections of\r\nthese organs often pass into those that are exceedingly intractable, if\r\nnot incurable.\r\n\r\nTHE EXAMINATION OF THE URINE. The urine itself, when subjected to\r\nmicroscopical or chemical examination, as we shall hereafter more fully\r\nexplain, offers the best means of determining the exact nature of these\r\ndistressing affections. When normal, the urine is of a pale straw-color,\r\nand throws down no deposits on cooling. In passing it no difficulty or\r\npain should be experienced, and it should spurt from the urethra in a\r\nfull, round, and regular stream, until the bladder is entirely emptied.\r\nIf the stream is forked, checked, or interrupted in any way before the\r\nbladder is completely emptied, it is evidence that something is wrong.\r\nStricture of the urethra, prostatic disease, and gravel, or stone in the\r\nbladder, are all capable of producing obstruction to the free flow of\r\nthe urine.\r\n\r\nHOW SLIGHT AILMENTS BECOME DANGEROUS DISEASES. As we have before stated,\r\nthe mucous membrane lining the bladder is reflected upwards into the\r\nureters, lining these canals. By reason of this continuity of mucous\r\nsurfaces, patients suffering from urethral, prostatic, and bladder\r\naffections, often die from disease of the kidneys. It must not be\r\nsupposed that because stricture of the urethra does not co-exist with\r\n_Brights_ disease, that the latter may not have been caused by the\r\nobstruction in the urethra due to stricture. Pulmonary consumption, for\r\ninstance, often begins in the form of nasal catarrh, but, by the\r\ncontinuity of the mucous membrane, it travels, so to speak, into the\r\nthroat, or pharnyx; from the pharnyx into the larnyx, and then into the\r\nlung structure itself. The disease is transferred from the nose into the\r\nlung tissue. What occurs in the nasal, laryngeal, and pulmonary tract of\r\nmucous membrane, happens, also, in the urinary tract. A gonorrhea, which\r\nis a specific acute inflammation of the urethral canal, leaves behind it\r\na slight gleet, or chronic inflammation of the mucous membrane of the\r\nurethra. This may give little inconvenience for a number of years, but\r\ngradually it culminates in a stricture, or, implicating the prostatic\r\nportion of the urethra, occasions inflammation of the prostate gland,\r\nand, perhaps, enlargement of this organ. This gradually gives rise to\r\ncystitis, or inflammation of the bladder. From the bladder, the disease\r\ntravels up the ureters into the kidneys, and finally _Brights_ disease\r\nis established in these organs.\r\n\r\nThe mucous membrane lining the bladder also extends through the urethra.\r\nThroughout the interior of the body, whether it be in the stomach,\r\nlungs, or other parts, this lining mucous membrane serves as a\r\nprotection to the parts beneath, just as the skin on the exterior of the\r\nbody serves as a protection to the sensitive true skin and the tissues\r\nunderneath it.\r\n\r\nTHE CAUSE OF CERTAIN DISTRESSING SYMPTOMS. Close to the neck of the\r\nbladder is a triangular space, on which the mucous membrane is smoother,\r\nand devoid of folds, or rugae, and which is far more sensitive and\r\nvascular than other portions of the mucous membrane lining this organ.\r\nIt is called the _trigone vesical_. This _trigone_ is the most depending\r\npart of the bladder. If there be stone in the bladder, it naturally\r\ngravitates and rests on this sensitive space, so that, when the bladder\r\nis empty, the foreign body occasions inconvenience, until the urine,\r\ntrickling down through the ureters, and intervening between the mucous\r\nmembrane and the stone, serves as a temporary protection to the mucous\r\nsurface. Hence the pain becomes less as the urine is secreted, until the\r\nwater is again passed, and the intervening fluid thereby removed, when\r\nthe stone again presses upon, and irritates, the sensitive _trigone_, by\r\ncoming into more immediate contact with it. The greater ease with\r\npatients afflicted with stone experience in a recumbent position in bed,\r\nor on a sofa, compared with being in an erect posture, is easily\r\nexplained. The foreign body, when the patient is standing, walking, or\r\nriding, falls by its own gravity on this sensitive spot; when in a\r\nrecumbent position, it rolls away from this sensitive _trigone_ into the\r\nback part of the bladder, where the mucous membrane is less sensitive;\r\nconsequently, the patient suffering from stone in the bladder is more\r\neasy at night, whereas, one suffering from prostatic disease, whether it\r\nbe inflammation of the prostate gland, or enlargement of that organ, is\r\nusually worse in bed.\r\n\r\nHOW BLADDER DISEASES COME TO BE CONFOUNDED WITH OTHER DISEASES. The\r\nbladder is largely supplied with blood-vessels, lymphatics, and nerves,\r\ngiven off from the same systems that supply the rectum or lower bowel,\r\nand in females the uterus or womb, and the ovaries. This accounts, in a\r\ngreat measure, for the symptoms of bladder disease in those afflicted\r\nwith piles, or other diseases of the lower bowel, or of diseases of the\r\nuterus or womb in the female. We have frequently been consulted by\r\npatients who had erroneously supposed themselves to be suffering from\r\ndisease of the bladder, or of the prostate gland, but whom we found, on\r\nexamination, to be suffering from hemorrhoids, or piles. In these cases,\r\nby removal of the pile tumors, the frequent desire to urinate, and all\r\npain in the region of the bladder, are promptly relieved. Sometimes,\r\nulcers located in the rectum, give very little unpleasant sensation in\r\nthe bowel, but produce pain in the bladder, with frequent desire to\r\nurinate. Enlargement of the uterus, the womb, or displacements of that\r\norgan, as prolapsus, or anteversion, and all capable of producing\r\nsymptoms of bladder disease. A frequent desire to urinate and more or\r\nless sharp pain in the region of the bladder are usually experienced in\r\nthese cases. Disease of the bladder, in like manner, often produces an\r\napparent disease of other organs through sympathy, and without great\r\ncare in diagnosticating each case, the _effect_ may be taken for the\r\n_cause_, and the patient treated for a disease which does not really\r\nexist.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE URETHRA.\r\n\r\nThe urethra, in the male, is the canal extending from the bladder to the\r\nend of the penis, through which the urine is passed. This canal starts\r\nfrom the base of the bladder, passes through the prostate gland, and,\r\nentering the penis, continues of about uniform size along the under part\r\nof the penis until it reaches the glans, or head of that organ, where it\r\nexpands somewhat into a bulb-like fossa, or cavity, and becomes reduced\r\nagain at the orifice. At a short distance from the bladder it receives\r\nthe outlets of the seminal ducts. The urethra is a most delicate and\r\nsensitive canal, and is surrounded by tissues of like delicacy, and is\r\nlined with a mucous membrane which is highly vascular, and filled with\r\nsensitive nerves. The introduction of any instrument into this canal is\r\nto be undertaken only when absolutely required, and when necessary. It\r\nshould be so skillfully and carefully effected that no pain or\r\nirritation can result. The slightest awkwardness is liable to cause an\r\nunnoticeable injury, which may result in a false passage, or an effusion\r\nof plastic lymph around the canal, which, organizing, forms the most\r\ntroublesome kind of organic structure. By proper and early treatment all\r\ndanger and pain is avoided, and a cure effected in a very short time. In\r\nan extensive practice, in which we yearly treat thousands of cases, we\r\nhave never yet failed to give perfect and permanent relief from\r\nstricture, or disease of the prostrate gland, without the necessity of\r\nusing cutting instruments of any kind, when we have been consulted\r\nbefore injury to the urethra has been produced by the improper use of\r\ninstruments. Having specialists who devote their entire time and\r\nattention to the study of these diseases, we are able to relieve and\r\ncure a large number painlessly and speedily, in which the awkward\r\nmanipulations of physicians or surgeons, whose hands, untrained by\r\nconstant and skillful use, not only fail to effect any benefit, but set\r\nup new, or aggravate existing, disease.\r\n\r\nThis subject will receive a more full and complete consideration in\r\nanother part of this treatise.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROSTATE GLAND.\r\n\r\nThe prostate is a gland of about the size and shape of a large chestnut,\r\nlying just in front of the bladder, and surrounding the urethra. The\r\nsize of the prostate gland varies considerably with the age of the\r\nperson. In early life it weighs but a few grains. As puberty approaches\r\nit becomes larger, and in the adult weighs from half an ounce to an\r\nounce. In old age it enlarges considerably, and sometimes presses upon\r\nthe bladder so as to impede the flow of urine. This condition is often\r\nconfounded with stricture, gravel, or stone in the bladder, by\r\ninexperienced physicians. Hypertrophy, or enlargement of the prostate\r\ngland, is not an unfrequent disease in the adult or middle-aged man.\r\nBeing in close contact with the bladder, when it enlarges it encroaches\r\non the bladder, pressing on it, and it has the effect of interfering\r\nwith the function of urination. As before indicated, enlargement or\r\nhypertrophy of the prostate gland, is often confounded with stricture,\r\ngravel, and stone in the bladder, by inexperienced physicians, and\r\ntreated accordingly. The true condition of this gland is readily\r\ndetermined by an examination through the rectum or lower bowel, the\r\nfinger of the expert surgeon being able to determine at once whether it\r\nis enlarged or not.\r\n\r\nTHE DANGER OF BAD TREATMENT. In disease of the prostate gland, as well\r\nas in inflammation of the kidneys and bladder, stricture of the urethra,\r\nand many other forms of urinary disease, the use of stimulating\r\ndiuretics, and the much-advertised \"kidney cures,\" \"buchus,\" and similar\r\npreparations, which largely increase the flow of urine, simply\r\naggravate, and do positive harm. In fact, the most difficult cases that\r\nwe have had to deal with have been those that, through such treatment,\r\neither taken on their own account or prescribed by inexperienced\r\nphysicians, have been rendered so much worse as to make their cases very\r\nintractable, and tedious to relieve and cure.\r\n\r\nREQUIRE NICELY ADAPTED TREATMENT. As we have heretofore indicated, there\r\nis no class of diseases that require nicer adaptation of medicines to\r\neach individual case, than those of the urinary organs. Medicines which,\r\nin one stage of these diseases are beneficial and curative, in another\r\nstage are often exceedingly injurious. Hence it is that we claim it to\r\nbe impossible for any one to put up any set prescription, or proprietary\r\nmedicine, that will meet the wants of a large percentage of this class\r\nof cases. The only rational course to be pursued is to examine carefully\r\neach case as it is presented; find out the exact condition and stage of\r\nthe disease with which the patient is afflicted, and then prescribe for\r\nit such special medicines as are nicely and exactly adapted to the\r\npatient's condition. These, in many cases, will have to be changed from\r\ntime to time, to suit the ever-changing condition of the disease, as it\r\nis modified by the treatment. Not only have the manufacturers of\r\n\"buchus,\" \"kidney cures,\" etc., committed grave errors by prescribing\r\nstimulating diuretics for almost all kidney and bladder diseases, under\r\nthe impression that, as the patient passes only a small quantity of\r\nurine at a time, the kidneys should be stimulated to secrete more, but\r\nphysicians in general practice have been very prone to commit the same\r\nerror in their practices. When the bladder and kidneys are in a weak and\r\ndiseased condition, incapable of efficient action, the bladder being\r\nalready unable to dispose of the diminished quantity of urine secreted,\r\nit is simply outrageous practice to administer medicines calculated to\r\nstimulate the kidneys to perform more work. By being thus forced, these\r\norgans become seriously diseased. It would appear most unreasonable to\r\nwhip and spur a horse already jaded from overwork. Common sense would\r\ndictate rest, which always does good; but, as the bladder is weak, the\r\ndoctor whips up the kidneys with drugs, thus endeavoring to force them\r\nto secrete more urine, and thereby the poor, crippled bladder, which is\r\nincapable of disposing of even the diminished quantity secreted, is\r\nactually made to do more work in a diseased and feeble condition, than\r\nit would perform in a sound, strong, and healthy state. The results of\r\nthis pernicious practice are _Bright's_ disease of the kidneys, cystitis\r\nor inflammation of the bladder, and numerous other grave maladies.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKIDNEY DISEASE.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiseases of the kidneys are generally very slow in their inception,\r\ncoming on gradually and manifesting no special symptoms of their\r\npresence until they have assumed a formidable character. For this reason\r\nthey are the more dangerous. Simple derangement of the urinary secretion\r\nis no evidence of disease of these organs, as changes in the color,\r\nquantity and specific gravity of the urine are often produced by changes\r\nof temperature, active or sedentary habits, mental emotion, and\r\nsometimes by articles of diet, or drink, as well as by the use of\r\ndifferent drugs.\r\n\r\nThe existence of disease of the kidneys in the early stages can only be\r\npositively determined by a microscopical and chemical examination of the\r\nurine, which reveals to us the presence of casts, epithelia, blood, pus,\r\netc. The microscope informs us not only of the presence of disease, but\r\nvery often of the particular portion of the kidney in which it is\r\nlocated, as well as of the stage which the disease has reached. We are\r\nalso aided by chemistry in determining the exact abnormal condition of\r\nthe kidneys by the detection of albumen, sugar, etc. These examinations,\r\nby aid of the microscope and chemical re-agents, should never be\r\nneglected by the physician. Without them his diagnosis, or judgment of\r\nthe patient's condition, is simply guess-work. With them he is enabled\r\nto base his treatment upon certain and positive knowledge of the\r\npatient's real and true condition.\r\n\r\nThe usual symptoms of chronic disease of the kidneys, but which vary\r\nmaterially with the age, constitutional peculiarities and temperament,\r\nare weakness in the small of the back, pains in the region of the loins\r\nand groins, numbness of the thigh on the side of the affected kidney\r\n(for often only one organ is affected), high-colored and often scalding\r\nurine, many times depositing a sediment, sometimes white or milky urine,\r\nbloody urine, frequent desire to pass the urine, partial impotency,\r\npains in the testicles and shooting into the loins, suppression or\r\ninability to pass the urine, gravel, stone in the bladder, dropsical\r\nswellings, swelling of the testicles, irritability and pain in the\r\nbladder, mucous and sometimes seminal discharges oozing from the\r\nurethra.\r\n\r\nWHEN THE BLADDER IS AFFECTED the prominent symptoms usually complained\r\nof are irritability of the bladder, accompanied by a frequent desire to\r\nurinate, inability to retain more than a small quantity of urine, and\r\nthis for a short time only, pain in the region of the bladder, extending\r\ninto the back, thighs, etc., hot scalding sensations in passing the\r\nurine, sediment in the urine, and sometimes bloody urine. The appetite\r\nis usually diminished, there is a depression of spirits, the urine is\r\noften passed only by drops, and is irregular in quantity and quality,\r\nfrequent inability to pass the urine at all, in males partial impotency,\r\nwith dull disagreeable pain in the testicles and irritation of the\r\nurethra, attended with mucous and sometimes seminal discharges oozing\r\nfrom the urethra. Some of these symptoms may be present as the result of\r\nfunctional or organic disease of other organs than the kidneys or\r\nbladder, and to distinguish them with positive certainty is impossible\r\nwithout the aid of a microscopical and chemical examination of the\r\nurine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBRIGHT'S DISEASE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis affection may appear in either an acute or chronic form. The acute\r\nform is frequently a complication, or sequel of scarlet fever,\r\ndiphtheria, cholera, typhoid fever, erysipelas or measles, and is\r\nfrequently developed by intemperance. The acute form of the disease is\r\nvery rapid in its progress, often destroying life by uraemic\r\npoisoning--the retention of urea in the system.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of the acute form are diminution or suppression of urine,\r\ndry skin, chills, thirst, pains in the loins, and a general dropsical,\r\npuffy condition of the system, especially manifesting itself in the\r\nearlier stages under the eyes, but gradually showing itself in the\r\noedema, or swelling of the feet, and lower extremities generally. Unless\r\npromptly relieved, the patient dies of coma (stupor), or from\r\nconvulsions. No person should be so rash as to attempt the treatment of\r\nthis dangerous affection without the aid of the best medical skill that\r\ncan be procured.\r\n\r\nIT IS THE CHRONIC FORM OF BRIGHT'S DISEASE that we propose principally\r\nto discuss in this article. True Bright's disease of the kidneys is an\r\ninsidious and most fatal form of organic disease.\r\n\r\nWe venture to assert that less than one per cent. of those who imagine\r\nthey have \"Bright's,\" have this disease at all. We find that most of\r\nthose who, as one of our Faculty puts it, _insist upon having_ Bright's\r\ndisease, base their \"diagnosis\" upon the ever-changing condition of the\r\nurinary secretion, and especially upon the copiousness of the deposit;\r\nwhereas, in true Bright's, deposits of any kind are rarely met with.\r\nPerhaps the form of deposit most commonly mistaken for Bright's disease,\r\nis that known to medical men as the _urates_. When the urates are in\r\nexcess they form a heavy pinkish deposit of a flocculent nature within\r\nfrom five to thirty minutes after the urine has been passed--that is,\r\nafter it has been passed sufficiently long to cool. To prove that the\r\ndeposit is urates, heat the specimen to the temperature of the blood,\r\nwhen the deposit in question will disappear. Excess of urates has now\r\nbeen definitely traced, in the majority of instances, to functional\r\ntorpidity of the liver.\r\n\r\nAnother common form of deposit is that in which the reaction of the\r\nurine, instead of being acid, as in health, is either neutral or\r\nalkaline, and in which the earthy phosphates are precipitated for this\r\nreason. The earthy phosphates, when thrown down by a neutral or an\r\nalkaline condition of the urine, appear as a heavy white deposit, which,\r\nthough usually devoid of clinical significance, is certainly calculated\r\nto frighten timid patients who read of the \"terrible ravages of\r\nBright's\" in the advertisements of various popular \"kidney cures.\" To\r\nprove that the precipitate is phosphatic in its nature, add a few drops\r\nof vinegar and it will disappear; whilst, if, after the vinegar has been\r\nadded, the specimen be brought to the boiling point, not only both the\r\nurates and phosphates remain in solution, but there is only one single\r\nsubstance known to pathological chemistry that can form a deposit under\r\nthese conditions--and that substance is albumen, which, if present in\r\nquantity, is always indicative of serious disease.\r\n\r\nThe papers are filled with the plausible but unwarranted statements of\r\nthe manufacturers of various \"kidney cures,\" who anxiously desire that\r\nevery one should be impressed with the idea that all their troubles\r\narise from kidney disease in order to sell large quantities of their\r\nmedicines. In many cases the unfortunate patient is rendered much worse\r\nby the use of remedies that are not suited to his condition, and which\r\nwill not cure the real trouble with which he is affected.\r\n\r\nDaily we are consulted by persons in whose cases these errors have been\r\nmade. In reality, true Bright's disease is not a common affection, and\r\nnine out often individuals who think that they suffer from it, or the\r\nearly stages of the trouble, in fact have something more curable. In\r\nsome cases it is an affection of the liver, which forces an excretion of\r\nunnatural salts by the kidneys, and thus renders the urine acrid and\r\nirritating, or they may be suffering from some other disease, such as a\r\ndeformity or enlargement of certain glands, as the prostate; unnatural\r\nposition of the organs, as with women who suffer from weakness, the\r\nuterus pressing forward on the bladder and urethra, and thus showing\r\nevery evidence of disease in the urinary canal. It is as common for\r\npersons to suffer from deformity of the urinary canal as from misshapen\r\nlimbs, or from noses and ears not of proper size and proportion.\r\n\r\nThe urinary canal, from the bladder outward, is narrow and delicate. Any\r\ndisease or injury therein is liable to result in gradual contraction,\r\nwhich may be manifested long years after the cause has been forgotten,\r\nor has disappeared. These affections, to the inexperienced, or the\r\nphysician who is not particularly alert and cautious in his diagnosis,\r\nare liable to cause error, and he will pronounce a given case Bright's\r\ndisease, when in reality there is some simple cause for the irritation\r\nof the urinary canal, and the pains in the kidneys, etc., all of which\r\nfrequently result from a slight damming up of the flow of water, and the\r\nprevention of free expulsion from the system of the salts of which the\r\nbody is relieved by the kidneys. They cannot work under pressure. When,\r\nfrom any cause, the flow of water is checked, and, as it were, dammed up\r\nso that a slight pressure is put upon the kidneys below, their secretion\r\nis most materially interfered with, and the many trains of symptoms that\r\nusher in disease of the kidneys, appear.\r\n\r\nThe true, and only sure way to relieve these conditions, as can be\r\nunderstood by any one, is to remove the real cause. The use of any\r\nmedicine that stimulates the kidneys to an irritable action, under such\r\npressure, is to be avoided, as it only makes the trouble worse,\r\nincreases the amount of water that is dammed up, and results in more\r\nserious manifestations of constitutional disease; whereas, by merely\r\nrelieving the choked outlet, the flow of water becomes free, and the\r\nkidneys are speedily restored to their natural condition. This is well\r\nillustrated by the following:\r\n\r\n\r\nCase 113,396.\r\n\r\n     As recorded at the Invalids' Hotel. L.C.K., farmer, age 41,\r\n     married. For a period of nearly ten years, as a result of\r\n     slight injury, he had suffered from cloudy and\r\n     unhealthy-looking water, with some burning on passing it;\r\n     frequent calls to urinate; swelling of the limbs, loss of\r\n     energy and strength; headache, etc.; gradually there appeared\r\n     severe pain in the back, at times recurring with a sense of\r\n     fullness in the abdomen. For a period of nearly eight years he\r\n     had been constantly treated by physicians at his home, all of\r\n     whom had investigated his case. He had made several long\r\n     journeys to consult the manufacturers of a much-advertised\r\n     \"kidney cure,\" who, after pretending to examine his urine,\r\n     scientifically (none of the proprietors are physicians),\r\n     assured him that, without the shadow of a doubt, his disease\r\n     was Bright's, and that he might be cured by their \"kidney\r\n     cure,\" which was for sale at all drug stores. For a period of\r\n     eighteen months he steadily took this \"cure,\" which, he states,\r\n     he is sure aggravated his disease, as, although his sufferings\r\n     at times were less, he felt that he was not improving in the\r\n     least, and that his disorder was not being properly controlled.\r\n     His home physician went with him on several occasions,\r\n     consulted with the owner of the proprietary medicine, and was\r\n     equally mistaken in his diagnosis. After consulting many\r\n     doctors, all of whom assured him they could give him treatment\r\n     that would prolong his life somewhat, and make his condition\r\n     comfortable, but that no treatment would affect his cure, he\r\n     was induced, by reading our article, heretofore referred to, to\r\n     consult us. A very thorough examination of the case was made,\r\n     which resulted in finding two contractions of the urethra,\r\n     which admitted only the smallest sized probe, and which,\r\n     necessarily, prevented the free flow of the urine. These were\r\n     speedily removed, when, much to the surprise of his family\r\n     physician, who accompanied him, over thirty-seven ounces of\r\n     fluid were drawn from the bladder. This gave him immediate and\r\n     perfect relief. The pains and aches in the region of the\r\n     kidneys, the weakness and tenderness, and the many other\r\n     uncomfortable symptoms with which he was troubled, all\r\n     disappeared. From a feeble and irritable invalid, in a few\r\n     weeks he was converted into a happy and cheerful man. The\r\n     symptoms of congestion and irritability of the kidneys\r\n     gradually disappeared, and in thirty days after visiting us he\r\n     writes that he feels himself entirely sound and well. This\r\n     gentleman states that he will be pleased to correspond with any\r\n     one who wishes to learn the particulars of his case, and his\r\n     full name and address will be furnished to any inquirer.\r\n\r\nBright's disease when fully established is characterized by degeneration\r\nof the kidneys. Submitted to examination, after death by this disease,\r\nthese organs present various appearances. Hence, the degeneration that\r\ncharacterizes the disease has been designated as waxy degeneration. Some\r\npathologists contend that the disease consists of several different\r\nrenal maladies, all of which, however, agree in the one ever-present\r\nsymptom of a more or less albuminous condition of the urine.\r\n\r\nAs to the causes of kidney disease, it may be said that any thing which\r\nwill give rise to a greater or less degree of congestion of the kidney\r\nwill induce either a temporary albuminous condition of the urine, or a\r\ntrue Bright's disease of the kidneys. Suppression of perspiration, by\r\nexposure to cold and wet, want of cleanliness, deficiency of nutritious\r\ndiet, liver disease, certain poisons in the system, as of scarlet fever,\r\nmeasles, erysipelas or diphtheria, taken in conjunction with sedentary\r\nhabits, bad air, excessive mental labor or worry, may each occasion an\r\nalbuminous urine, and finally result in Bright's disease, but of all\r\ncauses that appear to produce this disease, none are so prolific as\r\nintemperance. A scrofulous diathesis, or habit of body, may strongly\r\npredispose to the disease, and chronic kidney disease frequently follows\r\nacute rheumatism and the practice of masturbation. In some instances the\r\nchronic form of Bright's disease follows an acute attack, but is more\r\noften developed slowly and insidiously without any known cause.\r\n\r\nTHE SYMPTOMS of this fatal malady generally appear so gradually that\r\nthey excite but little or no concern until it has reached its more\r\nadvanced and dangerous stages. Frequently, a puffy, watery or flabby\r\ncondition of the face, particularly under the eyes, is the first symptom\r\nnoticed, and the patient may observe that his urine is diminished in\r\nquantity. The urine is sometimes abundant, but generally more scanty\r\nthan in health, is acid in its reaction, and generally of a low specific\r\ngravity. The countenance is generally somewhat pale and bloodless,\r\nwhich, taken with the dropsical condition of the system, and the\r\nconstant albuminous condition of the urine, points the expert specialist\r\nto Bright's disease of the kidneys. Various circumstances and conditions\r\nmay give rise to the temporary presence of albumen in the urine, and,\r\nalthough albumen may be temporarily absent from the urine even when\r\nBright's disease exists, yet this is not common. There are certain\r\nindirect symptoms which point clearly and almost unmistakably to the\r\npresence of this disease. These are deep-seated pain or weakness in the\r\nback, gradual loss of flesh, red, brown, or dingy urine, more or less\r\ndrowsiness, and as the disease advances, a smothering sensation, or\r\ndifficulty in breathing, with dropsical puffiness or swelling.\r\nOccasional attacks of nausea and vomiting are common; pains in the limbs\r\nand loins, which are often mistaken for rheumatism. Irregularity of the\r\nbowels is also common. The skin becomes harsh and dry, not perspiring\r\neven under active exercise. Sometimes these symptoms are years in their\r\ndevelopment, being very obscure at first, and in some cases the disease\r\nhas been known to prove fatal without the patient having experienced any\r\nextraordinary symptoms. With those whose systems are enfeebled by want,\r\nintemperance, exposures or disease, as scrofula or syphilis, the first\r\nsymptoms usually observed will be a frequent desire to urinate,\r\noccasional attacks of diarrhea, flatulency, dropsical swelling of the\r\nface, especially under the eyes, and afterwards of the extremities,\r\npaleness and increasing debility. Stupor, apoplexy and convulsions are\r\nthe forerunners of a fatal termination.\r\n\r\nMicroscopical and chemical examinations of the urine are the only\r\nreliable means of diagnosis, and should be often repeated. (See Urinary\r\nSigns, in Appendix.) As albumen is often present in the urine without\r\nthe existence of Bright's disease, it is impossible, except by the aid\r\nof the microscope, to distinguish true Bright's from other affections of\r\nthe kidneys. In both purulent urine, and that containing blood, albumen\r\nwill be found by the usual tests, but in smaller quantity than in\r\nBright's disease. Albumen, with disintegrated epithelia, hyaline, and\r\nlarge granular casts, as well as waxy casts, are peculiar to, and\r\ncharacteristic of, this disease.\r\n\r\nIn the treatment of this malady, our specialist's experience has been\r\nvery great, and attended with marvelous success. Of course, after the\r\nsubstance of the kidney has degenerated and broken down, and become\r\ndestroyed to any great extent, a cure is impossible. But that we now\r\npossess remedies of great value, and specific power over this terrible\r\ndisease, we have the most positive evidence in the remarkable success\r\nattended in its treatment. Most cases that are curable can be managed\r\nsuccessfully at a distance, the necessary medicines being sent either by\r\nmail or express. Our specialists have cured many in this way who were so\r\nbloated from dropsical effusion as to weigh twenty-five to forty pounds\r\nmore than usual. In our Sanitarium, where we have had the advantage of\r\nour Turkish baths and other appliances, we have cured some cases in\r\nwhich the removal of the dropsical effusion reduced the patient's weight\r\nsixty pounds.\r\n\r\nWe cannot, In conclusion, too strongly condemn the general resort to\r\nstrong diuretics so often prescribed by physicians for all forms of\r\nrenal maladies, but which, by over-stimulating the already weak and\r\ndelicate kidneys, only aggravate and render incurable thousands of cases\r\nannually. Not less harmful are the many advertised \"kidney cures,\"\r\n\"kidney remedies,\" \"buchus,\" and kindred preparations. They all contain\r\npowerful, stimulating diuretics, and, while they may appear for a short\r\ntime to do good, invariably render the case worse and far more difficult\r\nto cure. The cases of Bright's disease reported cured by these\r\npreparations are cases of far less dangerous maladies, made to appear,\r\nby exaggerated accounts of them, as true Bright's disease. The use of\r\nthese general, ready-made or proprietary remedies in any case of true\r\nBright's disease is hazardous in the extreme. In no disease is there\r\ngreater necessity for treatment nicely adapted to the exact condition of\r\nthe patient (which should always be carefully ascertained by\r\nmicroscopical and chemical examinations of the urine) than in this. As\r\nit is a disease that runs a slow course, there is always time to send\r\nsamples of the urine for examination by expert specialists, and no other\r\nphysician than a specialist of large experience should be entrusted with\r\nthe treatment of a malady so dangerous in its character, and in the\r\ndiagnosis and treatment of which general practitioners commit such\r\nfrequent, and often fatal, errors. (SEE TESTIMONIALS.)\r\n\r\n\r\nDIABETES. (POLYURIA AND GLYCOSURIA.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two essentially different varieties of this disease, one of\r\nwhich is called _Diabetes Insipidus_, or _Polyuria_, and the other\r\n_Diabetes Mellitus_, or _Glycosuria_. The first is characterized by an\r\nincrease in the amount of urine excreted, and yields readily to proper\r\ntreatment. The second is characterized by the presence of sugar in the\r\nurine, and under ordinary treatment often proves fatal.\r\n\r\nThe _causes_ are obscure, and are therefore not very well understood by\r\nthe profession.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS. A notable increase of the quantity of urine excreted is the\r\nfirst symptom which attracts the patient's attention. Frequently,\r\nseveral quarts, or even gallons, of urine are daily excreted, and it is\r\npaler than natural. The patient experiences extraordinary thirst, and\r\nhas an almost insatiable appetite, though at the same time he loses\r\nflesh and strength. The tongue may be either clammy and furred or\r\nunnaturally clean and red. The bowels become constipated, and a peculiar\r\nodor is observed in the patient's breath and exhales from his body. The\r\nskin becomes harsh, dry, and scurfy. There are dizziness, headache,\r\ndejection, lassitude, and not unfrequently blindness, caused by\r\ncataract, is developed in one or both eyes. The intellect is blunted,\r\nand, as the disease progresses, the emaciation and debility increase,\r\nand pulmonary diseases develop; or, perhaps, an uncontrollable diarrhea\r\nsets in, and the patient dies from exhaustion.\r\n\r\nIn this disease, as in Bright's, we have many medicines that produce\r\nspecific curative effects, enabling our specialists to treat it with\r\ngreatly increased success. The disease is readily diagnosticated, or\r\ndetermined, by chemical examination of the urine, so that we have been\r\nenabled to treat this class of cases very successfully at a distance,\r\nand without personal examinations. Great attention should be paid to the\r\ndiet in these cases. It should be highly nutritious, but anything of a\r\nsweet or starchy nature must be avoided.\r\n\r\nThe following articles are wholesome and afford sufficient variety,\r\nviz.: of animal food--beefsteak, game, poultry, fish, eggs, cheese,\r\ncream, butter; of vegetables--spinach, dandelion greens, turnip tops,\r\nwatercresses, lettuce, celery, and radishes; of drinks--tea, coffee,\r\nclaret, water, brandy and water, beef-tea, mutton-broth, or water\r\nacidulated with tartaric, nitric, citric, muriatic, or phosphoric acid.\r\nThe _forbidden_ articles are oysters, crabs, lobsters, sugar, wheat,\r\nrye, corn or oatmeal cakes, rice, potatoes, carrots, bests, peas, beans,\r\npastry, puddings, sweetened custards, apples, pears, peaches,\r\nstrawberries, currants, etc., also beer, sweet wines, port, rum, gin,\r\nand cider. (SEE TESTIMONIALS.)\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONIC INFLAMMATION OF THE BLADDER. (CHRONIC CYSTITIS.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis affection, also called _catarrh of the bladder_, is an inflammation\r\nof the mucous lining of this organ. It may occur at any period of life,\r\nbut it oftenest appears in the aged, and is usually associated with some\r\nobstruction to the flow of urine.\r\n\r\nCAUSES. It may be due to colds, injuries, irritating diuretics,\r\ninjections, extension of disease from the kidneys or adjacent organs,\r\nintemperance, severe horseback riding, recession of cutaneous\r\naffections, gout, rheumatism, etc.; but it more frequently results from\r\nstricture of the urethra, enlarged prostate gland, gravel, and\r\ngonorrhea. It is also caused by an habitual retention of the urine, and\r\nsometimes results from masturbation or self-abuse.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS. There is an uneasy sensation in the bladder, and heaviness and\r\nsometimes pain and weakness in the back and loins. The urine is scanty,\r\nand, although there is a desire to void it frequently, it is passed with\r\ndifficulty. If allowed to stand, it deposits more or less mucus, which\r\nis sometimes mistaken for semen. As the disease progresses, the quantity\r\nof the mucus increases. It is very viscid, and adheres to the sides of\r\nthe vessels, so that if an attempt be made to pour it out, it forms\r\nlong, tenacious, ropy threads. Sometimes the quantity of mucus is so\r\ngreat that on exposure to cold the whole mass becomes semi-solid, and\r\nresembles the white of an egg. The excreted urine is alkaline, acrid,\r\nexhales a strong odor of ammonia, and soon becomes exceedingly fetid.\r\nSometimes the urine becomes so thick that great difficulty is\r\nexperienced in expelling it from the bladder. Nocturnal emissions,\r\nimpotency, and loss of sexual desire are apt to ensue. Occasionally\r\nthere will be a spasmodic contraction of the bladder, with straining and\r\na sensation of scalding in the urethra, and sometimes the patient is\r\nunable to urinate.\r\n\r\nWhen ulceration occurs in the progress of the disease, as it is apt to\r\nin its advanced stages, blood will occasionally be seen in the urine. In\r\nthe advanced stages of the disease the system becomes greatly\r\ndebilitated, emaciation supervenes, with hectic fever, nervous\r\nirritability and, finally, death.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. A strict observance of the rules of hygiene is essential to a\r\ncure. We must ascertain the cause if possible, remove it, and thus\r\nprevent it from perpetuating the disease. The various causes and\r\nconditions involved in different cases demand corresponding\r\nmodifications of treatment; hence, it is useless for us to attempt to\r\nteach the non-professional how to treat this complex disease. We have\r\nsucceeded in curing many severe cases without seeing the patient, being\r\nguided in prescribing by indications furnished by microscopical and\r\nchemical examinations of the urine. (See Urinary Signs in Appendix.) In\r\nfact, nearly all cases can be cured at their homes, and without a\r\npersonal examination being made. In the worst cases, we have found it\r\nbest to have our patients at our institution, where we can wash out the\r\nbladder with soothing, healing lotions, and thus make direct\r\napplications to the diseased parts. (SEE TESTIMONIALS.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAVEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the solid constituents of the urine are increased to such an extent\r\nthat they cannot be held in solution, or when abnormal substances are\r\nsecreted, they are precipitated in small crystals, which, if minute, are\r\ncalled _gravel_. Another cause of the precipitation of these salts is a\r\nstricture of the urinary canal which, by interfering with the free\r\nexpulsion of all the fluid from the bladder, results in the retention of\r\na portion, which gradually undergoes decomposition. Salts from the urine\r\nare thus precipitated in the same way that they are thrown down in urine\r\nwhich is allowed to stand in a vessel. Any one can illustrate this, by\r\nallowing a small quantity of the urinary secretion to stand for a few\r\ndays either in an open or a closed bottle. Soon a white, flaky deposit\r\nwill be observed, which will become more and more dense, and finally\r\nfine grains will be seen precipitated at the bottom of the bottle.\r\nSimilar grains, lodging in the folds of the bladder, gradually increase\r\nin size, by the precipitation of more salts around them, and ultimately\r\nbecome a source of much irritation. When of large size, they are termed\r\n_calculi_ or stones. When these formations occur in the kidneys they are\r\ntermed _renal calculi_; when in the bladder, _vesical calculi_. There\r\nare several varieties of gravel, each depending upon different\r\nconditions of the system for its formation. The two prominent varieties\r\nare the red, containing uric acid, and the white, or phosphatic, gravel.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS. When the deposits are in the kidneys, there is pain in the\r\nback and loins, occasionally cutting and severe; sometimes it darts down\r\nthe course of the ureter to the bladder, and extends even to the thighs.\r\nWhen the deposits are in the bladder, there is a frequent desire to\r\nurinate, with a bearing-down, straining pain; also a cutting or\r\nscratching sensation in the urethra during micturition. In the male,\r\nintense pain is often experienced at the end of the penis. When the\r\nurine is voided in a vessel and allowed to settle, a gravelly deposit is\r\nseen, generally of a red or a white color, and the particles varying in\r\nsize.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. These urinary deposits indicate a general derangement of the\r\nsystem, as well as a local disease. Nutrition is imperfect and some of\r\nthe excretory organs are not properly performing their functions, or,\r\nperhaps, some portion of the body is being too rapidly wasted. Very\r\nfrequently we find these gravelly formations as the result of a\r\nrheumatic or a gouty diathesis. It is also a well-known fact that\r\ntorpidity of the liver throws an excessive amount of work on the\r\nkidneys. These organs then, in part, perform the function of the liver,\r\nand hence unnatural activity is required of them, and the secreting of\r\nsuch substances as uric acid, which precipitates readily and gives rise\r\nto severe irritation of the urinary canal.\r\n\r\nIn order to treat these cases rationally and successfully, it is first\r\nnecessary to ascertain by microscopical and perhaps chemical\r\nexaminations, the character of the deposit. By such an examination, the\r\nexact condition of the system which gives rise to these abnormal\r\nproducts may be definitely determined, and the remedies to be employed\r\nindicated. As the non-professional are not qualified to make such\r\nexaminations, it would be useless for us to suggest specific treatment\r\nfor the various forms of this affection.\r\n\r\nSamples of the urine may be sent to us with a brief description of the\r\nsymptoms experienced, and the proper medicines to cure can be returned\r\nby mail or express. Our specialists are treating, with uniform success,\r\nlarge numbers of cases in this way. (SEE TESTIMONIALS.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSTONE IN THE BLADDER.\r\n\r\n\r\nFew affections to which the human flesh is heir are more painful than\r\nthis terrible affliction. The cutting operation heretofore required to\r\nremove it, is considered one of the most dangerous operations that the\r\nsurgeon is ever called upon to perform.\r\n\r\nThe death of the Emperor Louis Napoleon, of France, from an operation\r\nfor the removal of a stone, at the hands of surgeons renowned for their\r\nskill, gave new impetus to the efforts of surgeons to invent some method\r\nthat would be less dangerous than that which has been heretofore\r\ncommonly employed. The cutting operations have been the rule. Of these\r\nthe operation by median-section is the safest, and is most commonly\r\nemployed for the removal of stones that are not too large, while the\r\nlateral operation is used where the stone is more than about one inch in\r\nits smallest diameter.\r\n\r\nAs will be seen by the consultation of any hospital record, the deaths\r\nin these various operations have been, in adults, from one in three to\r\none in every four cases--a very large percentage, and sufficient to\r\ndeter any sufferer from undergoing an operation except for the relief of\r\na condition which is in itself worse than death. Even when this alarming\r\ndeath-rate is explained to sufferers, they willingly undergo the\r\noperation, feeling that they would rather die than longer continue in\r\ntheir pain and anguish.\r\n\r\nOur specialists, not satisfied with the results of these operative\r\nmeasures, in their studies of the disease endeavored to perfect some\r\nother means by which these foreign bodies could be removed from the\r\nbladder without such great danger and pain. The operation by crushing,\r\nand removal without cutting, appeared to them to present the most\r\npracticable advantages, and they therefore devote their entire time to\r\nthe improvement of this method for the removal of stone.\r\n\r\nThe method of crushing was first invented by a French surgeon many years\r\nago; but, owing to his crude instruments, and the difficulty that was\r\nexperienced in expelling the pieces of stone, the operation was seldom\r\nemployed by surgeons. The improvements in these methods at the hands of\r\nBigelow and Sir Henry Thompson, with those that have been made by our\r\nspecialists, have resulted in our being able to present to sufferers\r\nwith this disease, a means of cure which is, we are assured, the most\r\nsuccessful known to modern medical science.\r\n\r\nThere have been so far in the history of the treatment of this malady by\r\nthe new method of cure, one hundred and twenty-odd cases operated upon\r\nat the hands of prominent surgeons, all of which were with less perfect\r\nmethods than that of our specialists, and there were but four deaths in\r\nthis large number. By the advantages which are the result of further\r\nimprovements by our specialists, we can assure you that this mortality\r\nis even less in our hands; in fact, approaches, as near as possible, to\r\na perfect method of cure.\r\n\r\nWe think that in a moderately healthy subject, one in which the kidneys\r\nare not badly diseased as the result of irritation from the calculus,\r\nthe operation is almost absolutely safe. The method consists in the\r\ncrushing of the stone, and its removal from the bladder by means of\r\nsmall silver catheters attached to an apparatus which gently and\r\nperfectly removes, by suction, all the pieces which are thrown to the\r\nbottom of the bladder. This operation has now been performed in our\r\ninstitution in a very large number of cases with uniform success, and\r\nthe cures have been effected in from six to eight weeks without a single\r\nunpleasant symptom arising during their progress. By this method it is\r\nnot necessary to remove the entire calculus at one operation, if it is a\r\nlarge one. By the old cutting operation this was required, as the\r\nbleeding was great, and what was to be done had to be done immediately,\r\nor the patient would die from the _hemorrhage_. With the new method a\r\npart of the large calculus, or when several exist, one or two of them,\r\nmay be removed at a time, after which the patient can rest and gain\r\nstrength for the second; or, if necessary, for the third operation.\r\n\r\nThe largest stone removed by us in this way was one weighing between\r\nseven and eight hundred grains, for which three operations were\r\nrequired. It is necessarily performed under a mild anæsthetic, which\r\nprevents suffering and secures the perfect relaxation of the patient. In\r\nthe case in which this large amount of stone was removed we feel certain\r\nthat a cure could not possibly have resulted from a cutting operation,\r\nas the heart was seriously affected, and the physical condition of the\r\npatient so low, as the result of years of suffering, that death would\r\nhave occurred while undergoing the operation. By carefully pursuing the\r\nnew method, and not prolonging the sittings more than a few minutes each\r\ntime, the entire stone was evacuated. The health of the patient\r\nconstantly improved during the interval of three operations, which\r\ncovered a space of seven weeks. This stone was as large as a hen's egg.\r\n\r\nSmall calculi or gravel are readily removed in a few moments' time by\r\nthe new method. In no case is there any bleeding. Instead of a large,\r\ngaping wound being left after the operation, from which secondary\r\nhemorrhage may take place, or poisoning result from the irritation of\r\ndecomposing urine, the parts are left in a healthy state with the\r\nsurface unbroken. The stone, a constant source of irritation, is\r\nremoved, and the health is speedily restored.\r\n\r\nWhen it is impossible for the patient to visit us, a careful examination\r\nof the urine is made, and if gravel have been passed, these are\r\ncarefully examined also. An idea of the composition of the stone is\r\narrived at by this means, and treatment is directed to dissolve it.\r\nSuccess has commonly followed this method of treatment, when the stone\r\nhas not been very large. With the gradual reduction of the size of the\r\nstone the irritation subsides, and the general health of the patient\r\nimproves. (SEE TESTIMONIALS.)\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONIC ENLARGEMENT OF THE PROSTATE GLAND. (HYPERTROPHY.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe prostate gland lies just in front of the base of the bladder, and\r\nsurrounding the urethra, or urinary canal. Enlargement, therefore, of\r\nthis body, if it be of considerable extent, causes it to encroach and\r\npress upon the base of the bladder, and to more or less constrict the\r\nurinary canal near the base or outlet of the bladder. The enlargement\r\nmay be only slight, or the dimensions of the gland may be increased from\r\nthe size of a large chestnut, its normal dimension, to the volume of a\r\npullet's egg, or even to the size of an orange.\r\n\r\nHypertrophy of the prostate generally arises from causes which operate\r\nin a slow and permanent manner. Whatever has a tendency to produce a\r\ndetermination of blood to, and an engorgement of, this organ, is capable\r\nof producing the affection, an augmented flow of blood to the the part\r\nhaving the effect to increase the nutrition. Among the most frequent\r\ncauses of this affection, are excessive venery, masturbation, disease of\r\nthe bladder, stricture of the urethra, horseback exercise, gonorrhea,\r\nand the employment of strong, stimulating diuretics. Some of the worst\r\ncases that we have had to deal with have occurred in old men, and, in\r\nfact, the malady is more common to those advanced in life; but it is\r\nfrequently produced in those of middle age by the causes enumerated.\r\n\r\nAmong the earliest symptoms of the disease is an uneasy feeling in the\r\nregion of the base of the bladder. There is a more frequent desire to\r\nurinate than usual, and, in the course of time, this frequency becomes\r\nmore urgent; still no particular notice may be taken of it, it being\r\nconsidered as \"only a slight inconvenience.\" After several months, or it\r\nmay be years, the discomfort increases, and nightly calls to empty the\r\nbladder become habitual. By and by the patient begins to find the\r\ndiscomfort of getting out of his warm bed very troublesome; still no\r\nnotice to taken of it. He does not consider it worth his while to\r\nconsult a doctor for \"such a trifle.\" In the course of time the patient\r\nis obliged to get out of bed twice during the night instead of once.\r\nAfterwards, the calls become still more frequent and urgent; the\r\ninconvenience more evident; finally, pain is substituted for\r\ninconvenience, and then the doctor is consulted. Unless a specialist of\r\nexperience be consulted, the bladder will most probably be examined, and\r\nmedicine will be prescribed only to excite the kidneys to secrete more\r\nurine, which does harm instead of good; the disease slowly, but surely\r\nprogressing. Patients often write us that they have had something wrong\r\nwith the bladder for a number of years, having to urinate more\r\nfrequently than they ought; sometimes having to do so three and four\r\ntimes during the night; in extreme cases even every half hour or so, and\r\nthat they are not able to pass it freely, but only in small quantities,\r\nand attended with much pain. These symptoms are not always constant, but\r\nlet up for a few weeks and then appear again. Things go on in this way\r\nfor a year or two, perhaps, when the passage of the urine is completely\r\nshut off for several hours, and the patient is in great agony until the\r\nbladder is relieved by the use of the catheter. After such instrumental\r\nrelief, for a day or two the urine may be natural again, coming at\r\nfirst, perhaps, in very small quantities, but by and by more freely.\r\nThen, after a week or two intervening, there may be another complete\r\nstoppage, attended, as before, with intense suffering, which will have\r\nto be again relieved by the use of an instrument.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing is a fair account of the usual progress of the disease and\r\nits symptoms. As the prostate gland becomes more irritated and inflamed\r\nfrom the natural progress of the disease, or from the irritation caused\r\nby the passage of instruments, or the employment of strong, harsh,\r\nstimulating diuretics, the urine becomes cloudy, and still later is\r\nfound to have deposited during the night in the chamber utensil a\r\nquantity of thick, tenacious, and usually offensive mucus. There is apt\r\nto be more or less discomfort in the rectum, or lower bowel, produced by\r\nthe pressure of the enlarged prostate upon it. Rarely, the first\r\nintimation of a large prostate occurs through a sudden retention of the\r\nurine, and the patient being under the impression that there was nothing\r\nwrong with the organ previously. Closely questioned, however, the\r\ninformation is elicited that there has been a long train of mild\r\nsymptoms, similar to those that we have described, preceding the attack\r\nof retention of the urine. This shows the importance of early attention\r\nand proper treatment when such symptoms are manifested. However slight\r\nthe inconvenience experienced, it should not be neglected. The disease\r\nshould be brought under control at the outset by skillful and\r\nnicely-adapted treatment. Usually before a person suffers from\r\ntoothache, the decay occasioning it has been gradually progressing\r\nwithout pain for from five to eight years. Just as the decay of the\r\ntooth may be arrested by the early attention of the dentist, so may\r\nprostatic disease by early attention be not only promptly relieved, but\r\npermanently cured.\r\n\r\nDisease of the prostate being slow in its inception and progress, is\r\nalso slow to yield even to the most skillful treatment. Being slow to\r\ndevelop, patients rarely seek assistance until the organ has become so\r\nlarge as to be seldom restorable to a size where mechanical means can be\r\nwholly dispensed with for relieving the bladder. Most surgeons are too\r\nmuch in the habit of depending on the catheter for the relief of the\r\npatient, and usually instruct the sufferer how to use it, telling them\r\nthat this, the catheter, is to be their only doctor for life. Great as\r\nis the relief afforded by the catheter, which has often saved life, yet\r\nit is a fact that its frequent and prolonged use often renders disease\r\nof the prostate very intractable and often wholly incurable. Frequent\r\nuse of the catheter, without any treatment to prevent the further\r\nenlargement of the diseased gland, or to reduce its size, permits the\r\npart to go on enlarging, and, besides, the constant use of the catheter\r\nirritates the prostatic portion of the urethra, causing thickening of\r\nthe lining membrane, and sooner or later a more or less complete organic\r\nstricture of this canal, depending upon thickening of the lining mucous\r\nmembrane, as well as upon the encroachment of the gland itself upon this\r\ncanal. Besides, when the use of the catheter is once commenced, even\r\nwhen the enlargement is not very great, it is with the utmost difficulty\r\nthat we have been able to induce patients to leave off its use. The\r\nbladder, becoming accustomed to its use, refuses to obey the will\r\nwithout this help. The irritation set up in the parts by the friction of\r\nthe catheter causes inflammation and exudation in the lining membrane.\r\nThis extends to the structure of the prostate itself and increases the\r\nhypertrophy or enlargement. It will, therefore, be seen how important it\r\nis to early resort to treatment to relieve the first manifestations of\r\nthis affection. A disease of so delicate a nature, and one so often\r\nconfounded with other maladies by inexperienced physicians, should only\r\nbe intrusted for treatment to expert specialists of large experience in\r\nthe management of this and kindred maladies.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRICTURE OF THE URETHRA.\r\n\r\n\r\nStricture of the urethra generally results from some specific disease of\r\nthe urethra, but may be caused by sexual excesses, exposure, or strain,\r\nor by the practice of masturbation or self-abuse. It runs a course\r\nvarying in time from a few days to many weeks or months, during which\r\ntime the patient is often unaware of the real cause of his sufferings.\r\n\r\nCommonly, the attention is first called to a stricture by a slight\r\ndischarge, or smarting sensation, or the appearance of an undue amount\r\nof mucous deposit in the urine. Occasionally, some difficulty in\r\nstarting the water, or a diminution in the size and force, or a twisting\r\nof the stream as it flows, is the first symptom. This passive stage is\r\nof variable duration. When skillful treatment is instituted at this\r\nstage of the disease, a speedy cure is easily effected without pain or\r\ndanger. Any exposure, improper use of instruments, or irritating cause,\r\nmay speedily give rise to the alarming symptoms due to closure of the\r\nurethra, from which fatal consequences may suddenly ensue.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.\r\nA Single Stricture of the Urethra.]\r\n\r\nThis condition is illustrated in Fig. 2, which shows the hard and tough\r\nstricture which surrounds the soft mucous membrane that lines the\r\nurinary canal. When irritated or inflamed, as the result of a cold or\r\nother cause, the mucous membrane becomes swollen and thickened, and, as\r\nthe stricture will not yield and enlarge, the result is that the urethra\r\nis almost completely closed, and it becomes impossible to pass the\r\nurine. Great pain is experienced, and the surgeon has to be called to\r\ndraw off the urine with a catheter, which, at best, is a very difficult\r\nand painful operation, when the urethra is so irritable and constricted.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. In the earlier stages of the malady, relief is given by the\r\nskillful use of instruments for dilating the canal, or, where this fails\r\nby the operation of urethrotomy, for which we employ an improved and\r\ningenious instrument, by which the stricture is readily and almost\r\npainlessly divided.\r\n\r\nIMPROVED METHODS. Our surgeons have operated upon many hundreds of bad\r\ncases by a very ingenious and almost painless method, that requires no\r\nuse of bougies in the after-treatment. This saves the patient an immense\r\namount of pain and annoyance, and enables him to go home almost\r\nimmediately after the operation.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary after-treatment, by dilatation with bougies, is very\r\ntedious, and often more painful than the operation itself, so that our\r\npeculiar method of treatment has been hailed with joy by those familiar\r\nwith the old and unnecessarily-painful systems of treatment. Besides,\r\nour more improved method has been followed by far more perfect cures in\r\nevery case operated upon.\r\n\r\nIn many of the cases coming under our observation and treatment, there\r\nhave been several strictures, as illustrated in Fig. 3, which shows the\r\nurethra constricted at three different points, besides a congenital\r\ncontraction at its mouth or meatus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.\r\nCondition of the Urethra with three Strictures and a congenital\r\ncontraction\r\nat the meatus or outlet.]\r\n\r\nSPERMATORRHEA not infrequently results from stricture of the urethra,\r\neven when the affection is quite slight. Our attention was first called\r\nto this subject by the consideration of the numerous cases in which\r\nepileptic convulsions or \"fits,\" and other serious diseases of the\r\nnervous system in children, have resulted from an unnatural contraction\r\nof the prepuce or foreskin, constituting what is termed _phimosis_.\r\n\r\nEvery surgeon of experience has met with many of these cases of reflex\r\nirritation. It occurred to us, that, inasmuch as these contractions of\r\nthe foreskin give rise to nervous diseases of an alarming nature, may\r\nnot an unnatural narrowing of the urethral canal, which must have\r\nexactly the same effect in retarding the flow of the urine, give rise to\r\nirritable nervous affections in adults. May not unnatural irritation and\r\nexcitement of the sexual organs, so set up, cause loss of semen to occur\r\nduring sleep, and consequent nervous and general debility?\r\n\r\nIt is a well recognized fact that the urethral canal should bear a\r\ncertain definite and proportionate size to that of the penis, just as\r\nthe length of the arm should naturally bear a certain proportion to the\r\nlength of the body. In the case of some parts of the body,\r\ndisproportionate development of the part may not give rise to anything\r\nfurther than unsightliness; but when we find the small size of the\r\nurethra retarding the free passage of the urine, then we may expect, if\r\nthis condition is long continued, to find more or less irritation of the\r\nurethra and, perhaps, of the bladder, also. When there is a contraction\r\nof the urethra at its external orifice, or at any point along its\r\ncourse, unnatural pressure is put upon the urinary canal behind the\r\nconstricted portion, and these parts must bear an undue strain during\r\nthe passage of the urine.\r\n\r\nIt is a well established fact that improper diet, cold, exposure, and\r\nover-work exert a very powerful modifying influence upon the urinary\r\nsecretion, frequently causing an acrid and irritating condition of this\r\nfluid. This condition, when associated with a contracted urethra, must\r\nresult in irritation of the mucous membrane lining this canal back of\r\nthe stricture, if long continued or frequently repeated. As an\r\nillustration, we have a hose pipe from which, by means of a small\r\nnozzle, water is expelled a considerable distance, but a great tension\r\nis put upon the hose behind the nozzle. If the pressure is increased\r\ngreatly the hose will burst; but, if the small nozzle be replaced with a\r\nlarger one, the projection of the stream will be quite as great, but all\r\nundue tension of the pipe is overcome and the danger of bursting is done\r\naway with. We have, in an unnaturally contracted urethra, a favorable\r\ncondition for the development of disease in the urinary canal and\r\nadjacent parts of the generative organs. Irritation is set up in the\r\nurethra behind the stricture by undue strain in passing water, and the\r\nfrequent reoccurrence of acrid urine, as the result of any of the causes\r\nwe have already mentioned, this irritation keeps gradually increasing.\r\nIt will be felt more during the periods when the urine is acrid, but may\r\npass unnoticed even at such times. The seminal sacs and the prostate and\r\nCowper's glands communicate with the deeper portions of the urethra by\r\nmeans of canals or ducts, lined with mucous membrane which is continuous\r\nwith the urethral mucous membrane. Hence we can readily see that not\r\nonly by reflex nervous irritation are those parts debilitated, through\r\nthe contraction of the urethra, but the affection is apt to extend by\r\ncontinuity of the mucous membrane, and thus become more and more\r\nmanifest, through symptoms of disease of the testicles, prostate gland\r\nand seminal vesicles, and these disorders become more and more seated\r\nthe longer the morbid condition of the urethra is allowed to run on,\r\nuntil there may be an entire loss of the sexual functions, occurring at\r\nan age when there should be present the most vigorous manhood. From no\r\nother cause can we explain the common prevalence of disease of the\r\ndeeper portions of the urethral canal and bladder, many times confounded\r\nwith other diseases of the urinary and generative organs.\r\n\r\nThe following is the history of a case that fully illustrates the\r\nforegoing statements:\r\n\r\n\r\nCASE 112,289. MR. O.C.E., SINGLE, 32 YEARS OF AGE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.\r\nCondition of the urethra in Case 112,289; permanently cured at the\r\nInvalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute.]\r\n\r\n     He applied to us suffering from entire loss of the sexual\r\n    function, with great nervous debility, and there was a thin\r\n    slimy discharge from the urethra, and the usual symptoms of\r\n    melancholia and weakness. He had lost all taste for business,\r\n    and was extremely nervous, from the fact that he was engaged\r\n    to be married, and felt that his condition would not permit\r\n    it. On examination a contraction of the urethra was found at\r\n    the point shown in Fig. 4, which had probably been present\r\n    for years. He stated that he never had been just right in\r\n    those parts, but had lived a virtuous life, had never had any\r\n    venereal disease, and, hence, the true nature of his trouble\r\n    had not been suspected. With the removal of the stricture\r\n    there was an immediate improvement in his condition, which\r\n    became more and more rapid, as his system gained strength and\r\n    reaction became manifest. At the end of two months he wrote\r\n    that he felt sound and well, and that he had experienced the\r\n    most wonderful improvement in every way. His vital strength\r\n    was fully restored, and he was most profoundly grateful.\r\n\r\nChronic inflammation of the bladder, sometimes called catarrh of the\r\nbladder, an affection that is elsewhere herein fully treated of, and\r\nchronic inflammation of the kidneys, and true Bright's disease, as well\r\nas prostatic disease, are all liable to result from strictures of the\r\nurethra. Hence, it behooves one suffering from this malady to have it\r\npromptly and skillfully treated.\r\n\r\nFALSE PASSAGES. In very rare cases of impassable stricture, or in which\r\nfistulous openings, or false passages, have formed, through which the\r\nurine flows or dribbles away, we have resorted to the operation of\r\nperineal section with the most gratifying results. The cases requiring\r\nthis operation are rare ones, in which death must generally result but\r\nfor the relief afforded by the operation.\r\n\r\nDANGEROUS USE OF INSTRUMENTS. The worst and most dangerous cases of\r\nstricture with which we have met, in a long and extensive experience,\r\nwere rendered thus by the careless or unskillful use of bougies,\r\ncatheters, or sounds. Many surgeons and physicians are most recklessly\r\ncareless or unskilled in the use of these most dangerous instruments, as\r\nthe many cases of false passage or stricture of the most painful and\r\ndangerous kind, caused or aggravated by their ignorant or improper use,\r\nsorrowfully testify.\r\n\r\nDELAY DANGEROUS. By proper treatment of stricture in its early stages,\r\nall danger and pain are avoided, and a cure is effected in a very short\r\ntime. In an extensive practice, in which we yearly treat hundreds of\r\ncases, we have never yet failed to give perfect and permanent relief\r\nfrom stricture, or diseased prostate or urethra, without the necessity\r\nof cutting instruments of any kind, when we have been consulted before\r\ninjury of the urethra has been produced by improper use of instruments.\r\nHaving specialists who devote their entire time to the study and cure of\r\nthese diseases, we are thereby enabled to attain the highest degree of\r\nskill in the management of these cases.\r\n\r\nGREAT SKILL REQUIRED. The urethra is a sensitive and delicate canal, and\r\nis surrounded by tissues the most delicate, and lined with mucous\r\nmembrane which is highly vascular and filled with sensitive nerves. The\r\nintroduction of any instrument is to be undertaken only when absolutely\r\nrequired, and, when necessary, it should be so skillfully and carefully\r\neffected that no pain or irritation can result. The slightest\r\nawkwardness is liable to cause an unnoticeable injury, which results in\r\nfalse passage or an effusion of plastic lymph around the canal, and as\r\nit organizes, the formation of the most troublesome organic stricture.\r\nThe attention not only of sufferers, but also of the profession, is\r\ncalled to the remarkable success of our operation, perineal section, by\r\nwhich a cure of extremely bad cases of impassable stricture and false\r\npassages, or urinary fistulas, is effected in from thirty to forty days,\r\nand with very little suffering. That we have been successful in such\r\ncases must be considered as conclusive evidence that no case of\r\nstricture, false passage, or urinary fistula, is beyond the reach of our\r\nskill.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONIALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a practice embracing the treatment of a vast number of cases of\r\ndiseases of the Urinary Organs, it has been our good fortune to effect\r\nmany remarkable cures. The experience gained in this field of practice\r\nhas made our specialists skilled experts, and hence hundreds consult\r\nthem as a last resort. In fact we seldom get a case, in this line, that\r\nhas not been the rounds of the home physicians before applying to us for\r\nrelief and cure. The cures, therefore, which we shall introduce here are\r\nthe more remarkable because of the failure, in nearly every case, of\r\nother medical men to benefit or cure. They are not the every-day,\r\nordinary cases met with in the general practitioner's rounds, but\r\ncomplicated, obstinate ones, which had generally been given up as\r\nhopeless before coming to us.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASE 4A-3431. \"WASTED TO A SHADOW.\" BLEEDING FROM KIDNEYS. A SEVERE\r\nCASE.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: T.S. Bailey, Esq.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--I think it my duty to write to you concerning my case. In\r\nthe year 1886 I was seized with inflammation of the bladder and passed\r\nnothing but thick blood, owing to heavy work, and I consulted a doctor\r\nand he said there was no cure for such a bad case; but he gave me\r\nmedicine and it relieved me at the time I used it; and I took 16 bottles\r\nand I got worse and wasted to a shadow. I quit taking the medicine, and\r\nother complaints came, as rupture in the spermatic cord, for which I\r\napplied to you and soon got relief. And in 1891 the bladder disease made\r\nits appearance, and I wrote to the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical\r\nInstitute and got no reply as our mails were stopped on account of snow\r\ndrifts. I sent for the best doctor in Listowell and I still got worse,\r\nand he said I might live three or four weeks, but there was no stoppage\r\nof the disease. And I got so weak that I had to support myself by the\r\nfurniture in my room; and I wasted down to 100 lbs. in two weeks; and I\r\napplied to your Institute and I received my medicine in a few days, and\r\nin two weeks I began to gather strength and now I am hearty and well and\r\nmy weight is 145 lbs. I feel so thankful to the Medical Association and\r\nits Staff of skilled men. It is 15 months since I quit taking your\r\nmedicines and no signs of the disease returning.\r\n\r\n    Yours gratefully,\r\n    THOMAS S.

It became gradually worse and I endured extreme pain, so much\r\nso that I was laid up for weeks at a time, and almost gave up in\r\ndespair. I was persuaded to go to the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical\r\nInstitute. I have never regretted following this advice. While there I\r\nsubmitted to an operation by their specialist. This was entirely\r\npainless and the result perfectly satisfactory. I left in a short time\r\ndelighted, and have since been strong and well. I cannot speak in too\r\nhigh praise of this famous Institution; the rooms are large and\r\npleasant, the food the very best, the attendants kind and attentive and\r\nthe staff of physicians skillful and of large experience.

I am sure that your Institution\r\nis far in advance of the age, and would wish that every invalid could\r\navail himself of the treatment that I received in your most excellently\r\nkept Invalids' Hotel. I cheerfully give this as my testimonial to\r\nindividuals, friends and sufferers. My health is so fully restored that\r\nI look upon life with pleasure and comfort, whereas before I was a\r\nsuffering, nervous invalid, unable to sleep and much of the time in\r\ntorment.

BLADDER, RECTAL, KIDNEY AND LIVER DISEASE. \"ENTIRE URINARY\r\nORGANS ONE MASS OF SORES.\" \"DESPAIRED OF CURE.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: S.C. Tracy, Esq.]\r\n\r\nMy disease was caused by the roughness and exposure incidental to the\r\nlife of a miner, working in the gold mines of California and Montana. I\r\nhad much of the time to work in water, with my clothes wet, which\r\nfinally brought on a severe pain In my kidney, which ere long completely\r\nprostrated me. I employed and was treated by six different physicians,\r\nthe best I could obtain in my section of country, and who while seeming\r\nto understand the nature of my disease, yet gave me no remedy that\r\nafforded me any real relief. I grew worse under the treatment of them\r\nall. The pain in the kidney left me, but immediately located in the\r\nbladder. My bladder became very painful and commenced to ulcerate and\r\nfill up. It seemed from the excruciating agony I suffered, that there\r\nmust have been an abscess in either the kidney or bladder, and from the\r\nlarge amount of pus discharged at one time, it appeared to me that my\r\nkidneys, bladder and the entire urinary organs were one mass of sores\r\nand pus mixed with blood. I had to use injections of laudanum daily in\r\nthe lower bowels to ease the pain and live. Was reduced by long\r\nsuffering, looking for each day to be my last. I felt that no human\r\npower on earth could help me. No language can describe, and God only\r\nknows, the agony I suffered. From what I have already written, you may\r\nform some faint conception of my physical condition at the end of six\r\nyears' treatment by the best medical aid I could get in the section\r\nwhere I was living. I also used for some time (with no benefit),\r\n\"Warner's Safe Cure,\" and in fact, tried every means that I could hear\r\nof, but to no permanent relief. Such was my condition when I was led\r\nfinally to consult and be treated by your Association, though I had but\r\nfaint hope of obtaining any relief from any one. With the very best\r\ndescription I could give in writing of my case, and all the information\r\nyou got from me, you would not undertake the case until you were further\r\ninformed, and for which caution I sincerely thank you. You wrote me--\"we\r\nare at a loss to definitely determine your condition. We have an opinion\r\nbased upon the facts before us, but we feel that we must have a personal\r\nexamination.\" In the condition I was then in, I could not have been kept\r\nalive to reach the first railroad station, which was only six miles from\r\nmy house, and much less to travel to Buffalo. Indeed I wrote you, that\r\nif you would cure me for nothing, I was unable to go to you. In reply,\r\nyou then advised me to take your \"Special Remedies\" until I could\r\nimprove sufficiently to go to Buffalo for examination. Now this frank\r\nanswer of yours, removed every doubt from my mind, and convinced me that\r\nyou were _honorable physicians_. On March 10th, 1883, I began taking\r\nyour \"Special Remedies,\" as you prescribed them, and at the end of three\r\nyears' constant treatment, I was improved sufficiently to go to Buffalo\r\nto your Institute, where I was examined as you required of me. When I\r\nreached your Institute, I was there carefully examined and received a\r\nmonth's treatment. When I reflect on my condition and my suffering when\r\nI first began to use your specifics, and see what I am now, I feel that\r\nno words can too glowingly express my gratitude to your Association for\r\nthe physical benefits you have conferred upon me by your treatment of my\r\ndespaired-of case.\r\n\r\n    SAMUEL C.

After suffering for ten\r\nor twelve years with retention of the urine, and bladder difficulties, I\r\ncan say that I found immediate relief at your hands.

I was\r\nafflicted with an enlarged prostate and chronic Inflammation, or\r\ncatarrhal condition of the bladder. I was largely benefited by the\r\ntreatment I received there, and had I remained a little longer, as I was\r\nadvised to do by the doctor who attended me, I should have fully\r\nrecovered. I was so nearly cured that I did not think it necessary to\r\nremain longer, as I supposed nature would do for me what remained to be\r\ndone, to effect a perfect cure. My business was urgent. I could not well\r\nremain longer. In this I made a mistake, I should have remained longer.\r\nI was seventy-two years old at the time. I bear willing testimony to the\r\nability of the medical staff and the interest the doctors take in the\r\nwelfare of their patients. The nurses and all the subordinates were very\r\nkind and seemed to vie with each other to contribute to the pleasure and\r\nhappiness of the inmates of the Institute. One will find the Institute\r\nequipped with all the improvements known to modern science, for the\r\npromotion and restoration of health. It is impossible to do justice to\r\nits merits in a short article of this kind.

With\r\nheart-felt gratitude I can truthfully say I am relieved of my trouble. I\r\nmost cheerfully and earnestly recommend this Institution to all who are\r\nafflicted with chronic and painful diseases, no matter of what nature.\r\nDuring my stay there I saw some wonderful cures and surgical operations.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly,\r\n    JOHN H.

It was filled with invalids who were under the care of a\r\ncorps of physicians and surgeons and the fact that all the sick people\r\nappeared to be improving, and that they were both cheerful and hopeful,\r\nand that they all spoke well of the Institution and of its doctors, was\r\ncalculated to inspire confidence in one who went there himself to be\r\ntreated. The greater number of these cases, as far as I was able to\r\nlearn, were chronic and of a complicated character. They represented a\r\nwide range of the States and Territories of the Union, and had in each\r\nexhausted the resources of the home physicians. Having myself been\r\ntreated by your Faculty for a complication of troubles induced by\r\nexposure and malaria, I feel that I owe my restoration to health to your\r\nskill and devotion, at a time when I was unable to perform labor and was\r\nmuch discouraged, and had failed to obtain relief elsewhere.

I was\r\nsick for seven years; could not do anything; was visited by seven\r\ndoctors and was treated by four, and was given up to die by one of the\r\nbest doctors of Russellville. He said I could not live longer than fall.\r\nHe treated me for Sugar Diabetes, while the rest said I had inflammation\r\nof the bladder. After giving up all hopes of being cured at home, a\r\nfriend got me to write to Dr. Pierce's Institution and after\r\ncorresponding: awhile I decided to go and be treated. I was there one\r\nmonth and I never was cared for or treated more kindly by any one. No\r\nparents could have been better to their sick children. I cannot speak\r\ntoo highly of the Institution, and I believe I would have been in my\r\ngrave to-day if I had not gone and been treated.\r\n\r\nI feel great pleasure in expressing to you my sincere thanks for the\r\ncure that has been effected in my case, by your very skillful treatment,\r\nwhereby I am now entirely and I trust permanently cured from a dangerous\r\ndisease, which had defied the utmost skill of all former medical\r\nattendants for the past five years, and from which I had despaired of\r\nbeing: relieved. I am happy to state that my health is so good since\r\ntaking the month's course of treatment at your Institute, and, the home\r\ntreatment since my return, that I am now able to carry on the work of my\r\nfarm.\r\n\r\nI would cheerfully recommend all persons requiring medical or surgical\r\naid to consult you at the earliest possible opportunity, as I know by\r\npersonal experience that the facilities cannot be surpassed for\r\ntreatment of all classes of chronic diseases.\r\n\r\n    Most gratefully yours,\r\n    J.D.

The Invalids' Hotel is a place as much like home as it is\r\npossible for such an institution to be.

STONE IN BLADDER. CASE SIMILAR TO THAT OF COL. ELLIOTT F.\r\nSHEPARD, WHO DIED IN NEW YORK WHILE UNDERGOING AN OPERATION.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: David S. Clark, Esq.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--I am seventy-seven years of age and have resided in Erie\r\nfor sixty-two years, and for thirty-six years have been an elder in the\r\nFirst Presbyterian Church. During four or five years I suffered from a\r\npainful affection of the bladder; the severity permitted neither freedom\r\nfrom pain by day nor calm repose by night. Meanwhile, I consulted\r\nleading physicians and visited numerous health resorts. Neither time,\r\nmeans nor effort were spared that I might be free from pain. Relief came\r\nunexpectedly. A signal act of Providence, that should be acknowledged\r\ndaily, brought your Institution to my notice, though I had then no\r\nacquaintance with any one connected with it. With me it was a question\r\nof life or death. Up to last March I was in a condition of unendurable\r\ntorture. I knew that at my age, after the months of pain already borne,\r\nthat any operation would be serious, perhaps fatal. Accordingly, I\r\narranged my temporal affairs and carefully \"set my house in order.\" On\r\nthe 13th of March last, I started for Buffalo to your Institution. Still\r\nuninformed as to the cause of my trouble, I submitted to a searching\r\nexamination, as to my habits, constitution, parentage, the age and cause\r\nof death of my parents, and other facts, from which a tolerable\r\nbiography could have been prepared. All was kindly intended. Their aim\r\nwas to locate my ailment and then to determine my ability to undergo an\r\noperation. Having found a stone in the bladder, they advised that it be\r\ncrushed and extracted. By a strange coincidence as this was announced, I\r\nlearned of Col. Elliott F. Shepard's death under an operation for the\r\nsame disease. He was many years my junior, and seemingly far better able\r\nto undergo the operation. Still, in my desperation, I determined to go\r\non. During five days, I was under treatment for the coming operation. On\r\nthe 18th of March the stone was crushed and extracted. It was a complete\r\nsuccess. Of the consideration, tenderness and skill of the surgeon and\r\nhis assistants, I cannot too strongly speak. Of the gentle and assiduous\r\nnurses, the system and completeness of the whole establishment, as it\r\nmoved along as one harmonious whole, in all its departments, I cannot\r\nsufficiently express my admiration. I am now relieved of a state of\r\ntorture, and restored to health and happiness equal to any period of my\r\nlife. This I say with sincerity and emphasis. Since then I have gained\r\ntwenty-two pounds in flesh. I wish my words could reach the ear of every\r\none similarly affected, throughout our land, to banish all doubts and\r\ntake advantage of the science, skill and pleasant surroundings so\r\nhappily blended in your Institution, for the removal of pain and the\r\nmitigation of distress.\r\n\r\n    DAVID S.

For ten years I was a sick man, and during\r\nthree years I suffered so much that life was a burden. My business had\r\nto be given up and the torments were something that could not be\r\ndescribed. Every little while I had to urinate, and each time suffered a\r\nspasm of pain, like a knife thrust; the use of a catheter was painful\r\nand often it took long and painful trials before the water could be\r\ndrawn off. I passed blood, in quantities at times. When I went to your\r\nplace we had given up hope of a cure, and relief was all that I looked\r\nfor. My doctors at home discouraged me. I spent four weeks in your\r\nInvalids' Hotel, and now at the age of sixty-seven years am sound and\r\nhearty as any one, work from five in the morning until seven at night. I\r\nmanage a large and active business and enjoy life. I cannot express my\r\nhigh praise of your Institution. Your doctors are skillful and the\r\nnurses all kind and good.

I had been suffering for ten or twelve years\r\nwith bladder trouble, and our home physicians did not seem to understand\r\nthe cause or the trouble, and I finally corresponded with your faculty,\r\nand their advice was to come and have an examination. I had been a great\r\nsufferer and was so weak that I could hardly walk from the hotel to the\r\ndepot, and those who saw me start said that I would be brought home in a\r\nbox. Soon after my arrival an examination revealed a stone in my\r\nbladder. After a few days' treatment to strengthen up the system, the\r\nstone was taken out, weighing 530 grains. Four or five others were\r\nafterwards taken out of smaller size, and I am still alive. Will soon be\r\nseventy-six years old, and I cannot speak too highly of the care and\r\nattention I received from the physicians and nurses while there.\r\nEverything that was provided was of the best; good food, glean\r\napartments; and no better place can be found for treatment of the many\r\ndiseases they advertise to cure.\r\n\r\nAnyone suffering from bladder or kindred trouble can find relief at the\r\nInvalids' Hotel, Buffalo, N.Y.\r\n\r\n    Respectfully,\r\n    C.A.

It affords me the\r\ngreatest pleasure to say to you and to the world at large, that the\r\ntreatment and operation I received at your Institution was an entire\r\nsuccess and a miraculous cure. After twenty-five long years of suffering\r\nsuch as few people endure, caused from exposure while in the military\r\nservice of the United States, I contracted kidney and bladder disease,\r\nwhich shortly afterwards resulted in the formation of a calculus or\r\nstone. I experimented with medicines. Special Prescriptions, etc., from\r\nsome of the most eminent physicians in the world, in fact everything\r\nthat promised relief and help for my kidneys was used, but received no\r\nrelief, until the bladder discomfort became unendurable. As a last\r\nresort, knowing full well that life with me would be very short unless I\r\ncould receive immediate relief, I went to your famous Institute, where I\r\nwas treated and operated upon and a large stone was removed from the\r\nbladder. The old method of cutting, which is so dangerous, was not\r\nemployed, but the new and painless process of crushing; this process was\r\nan agreeable surprise to me, no pain and no risk, as in the old method\r\nof cutting. From the day of the operation I began to improve, and in a\r\nfew weeks thereafter I returned home to my wife, family and friends, a\r\nwell and happy man, and I have spent the last five years with ease,\r\ncomfort and pleasure--a living, walking testimonial for your renowned\r\nInstitute. Believe me, when I say that words fail me to express to you\r\nmy sincere gratitude for your marvelous and almost miraculous cure\r\neffected in my case. I feel sure no invalid could receive more skillful\r\nand kindly attention anywhere in the world. I would urge every sufferer\r\nto take treatment at the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute,\r\nbelieving it to be the most skillful, and feel sure that it is the most\r\nadvanced of the age.\r\n\r\n    Sincerely and gratefully yours,\r\n    WM.

STONE IN BLADDER ONE AND A HALF INCHES IN DIAMETER\r\nSUCCESSFULLY REMOVED WITHOUT CUTTING OR PAIN.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Thos. Daltry, Esq.]\r\n\r\nFrom severe exposure when in the army, I brought upon myself an acute\r\nattack of rheumatism, from which I suffered terrible pain. Following\r\nthis I began to be troubled with my bladder and kidneys. For three years\r\nI experienced considerable discomfort. There was severe burning and\r\nscalding, and urination caused much pain. I passed two pieces of gravel\r\nand became convinced that I had stone in the bladder. Was examined by my\r\nhome physician, who said there was no stone. I was not satisfied,\r\nhowever, and went to the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute. I was\r\nexamined by their specialist. After an injection of cocaine and\r\ncarefully cleansing out the bladder, a stone was found about one inch\r\nand a half in diameter, probably similar in its composition to the\r\npieces already passed. I was advised to have it operated upon and\r\nremoved, which I arranged to do. The process used was their new and\r\npainless one of crushing, no knife or other cutting instrument being\r\nemployed. The stone was readily grasped by the crusher and reduced to\r\nsmall fragments. The evacuator was then introduced and the stone\r\nentirely removed. After a few weeks' careful attention my health was\r\nentirely restored and I was able to leave for home. I take great\r\npleasure in making public my wonderful cure. I could not speak in too\r\nhigh praise of those who took charge of my case, nor recommend too\r\nhighly this famous Institution. It is about three years since I was\r\noperated on, and pave not felt any bad effects since.\r\n\r\n    THOS. DALTRY,\r\n    Huntington, Huntington, Co., Ind.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASE 820,539.

A STRONG ENDORSEMENT.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: H.E. Bankston, Esq.]\r\n\r\n_To whom it may concern:_\r\n\r\nThis is to certify that I took treatment at the Invalids' Hotel and\r\nSurgical Institute, Buffalo, N.Y., and I was cured of a chronic trouble\r\nthat had been maltreated by other physicians. While there I saw a man\r\nwho had been cured by the specialists, who had before been given up to\r\ndie by the best doctors in Troy, N.Y. Of course, the case must have been\r\na very stubborn one. I afterwards saw a man here, in Georgia, die, who,\r\nif he had been in Pierce's Surgical Institute under the treatment and\r\ncare of his skilled doctors and nurses, I know would have most assuredly\r\ngot well. Why? Because it was only a case of _stone in the bladder_, and\r\nthey are easily cured at Dr. Pierce's Surgical Institute. I think almost\r\nany chronic disease can be cured there, if taken in time, judging from\r\nmy observations while an inmate of that Institution.\r\n\r\n    H.E. BANKSTON,\r\n    Barnesville.

Ritter, Esq.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--It is now about six months since I discontinued your\r\ntreatment, and as I have had no return of the old symptoms, I consider\r\nit unnecessary to take more medicine. When I visited your Institution\r\nsome two years ago, I had but faint hopes of ever being restored to\r\nhealth, as I was suffering from a complication of diseases. My case was\r\nan unusually obstinate one, yet I am satisfied that a cure could have\r\nbeen accomplished in half the time, had I been able to follow your\r\ndirections in regard to diet more closely. I hereby tender you my\r\nsincerest thanks for the kind treatment received while at your\r\nInstitution. Those days will always be the happiest in my memory. I will\r\nclose by giving your faculty my sincere thanks, and hope success will\r\ncrown your business.\r\n\r\n    Yours very gratefully,\r\n    J.F.

STRICTURE CURED AFTER MANY OPERATIONS BY OTHER SURGEONS\r\nHAD PROVEN TO BE FAILURES.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Archie Ritchie, Esq.]\r\n\r\nI would state that I am an architect, fifty-two years of age, that about\r\nseventeen years ago I fell from a scaffold, a distance of eighteen feet,\r\nacross a beam, striking upon the perineum. A physician was immediately\r\ncalled and I was treated by him for about eight or ten weeks. A catheter\r\nwas introduced into the bladder, but caused such intense pain and\r\nanguish that it had to be withdrawn. It was tried again but could not be\r\nintroduced on account of the lacerations in the urethra, caused by the\r\nviolence used. A consultation was held and an operation recommended. An\r\nanæsthetic was used and a cut made through the perineum from the outside\r\ninto the bladder. A catheter was inserted into the bladder, tied in\r\nplace and left in position for about eight weeks. After eight or nine\r\nweeks the catheter was removed, but it was four or five weeks before the\r\nwound in the perineum healed. After a few months I began to have a\r\nurinary difficulty, and symptoms of urethral stricture. This condition\r\ncontinued until the urethra was entirely closed, and it was impossible\r\nto make water. A physician attempted to pass a catheter, but could not\r\ndo so. He continued to treat me by the process of dilation for five or\r\nsix months. I began to feel more comfortable, but the symptoms of\r\nstricture would manifest themselves again. I then went to a hospital at\r\nToronto. There I was treated also by the dilating method. The treatment\r\nwas continued for about four weeks, but became so very painful, and\r\nthere was so much irritation in the urethra, that it was impossible to\r\nendure it longer. They then called an electrical specialist and he began\r\ntreatment by electrolysis. In about three weeks I went home, but in a\r\nshort time the stricture again manifested itself; the contraction was\r\nvery marked, and micturition very difficult. It grew gradually worse and\r\nI could not receive any comfort or benefit. I returned to Toronto to\r\ntake further treatment from the electrical specialist. During the\r\noperations of dilation of the urethra, I passed some gravel. After four\r\nweeks treatment I returned home, but in about two months was as bad as\r\never, and last October went back to Toronto and was again treated by the\r\nelectrical method. The doctor had much difficulty in inserting the\r\nsmallest catheter, and it caused intense pain and suffering. The last\r\ntime he attempted to insert a catheter, there seemed to be something\r\ngive way, and a large amount of pus and fluid passed from the rectum.\r\nThe physician told me an abscess had formed. I returned home and tried\r\nto keep as comfortable as possible, but could not micturate with any\r\ndegree of satisfaction or comfort. I gradually began to grow worse and\r\nthere was a return of the stricture with inflammation of the bladder. In\r\nMarch, 1892, there began to be formed gravel in the bladder. They would\r\nat times obstruct the flow of urine entirely. I kept going from bad to\r\nworse, until the urethra appeared to be entirely closed. The physician I\r\ncalled found it impossible to pass a catheter Into the bladder, and\r\nadvised me to go to some hospital where I could receive proper\r\ntreatment, and where proper appliances for this class of cases were\r\nused, as he felt satisfied nothing could be accomplished for me at home.\r\nI then came to the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute in Buffalo to\r\nreceive treatment, and the treatment has been so successful that the\r\nurethral stricture as well as the gravel have been removed. After I\r\nreturned home I felt as if a great load had been lifted from my\r\nshoulders. I have no irritation at all as I used to have, and I can keep\r\nmy water for six or seven hours without any trouble, and the water seems\r\nto be clear and free from sediment of any sort, and in general I feel as\r\nI never expected to again. The doctors here were dumb-founded at the\r\nshort time I was in getting fixed at your Institution, and feel ashamed\r\nto ask any questions as to treatment. Many months have passed and I\r\ncontinue well and active in my profession. Any one I can send the way of\r\nyour Institution you may be sure I shall do so, and thanking you\r\npersonally for your kind and successful treatment of my case,\r\n\r\n    I remain ever your well-wisher,\r\n    ARCHIE RITCHIE, Architect,\r\n    Mount Forest, Ont.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRATEFUL LETTER FROM A PROMINENT ARCHITECT.\r\n\r\nTO THE WORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION:\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--It is again with the greatest of pleasure that I write you\r\nafter twelve months since I was treated in your Institution, to add to\r\nmy former testimonial.

STRICTURE, THE RESULT OF INJURY--CURE PERMANENT.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mr. Fay Sawdy.]\r\n\r\nThe stricture, which resulted from an injury, had been greatly\r\naggravated by uric acid crystals which were continually forming in the\r\nurine. Patient had rheumatism, causing this acid state of the system. He\r\nhad been a great sufferer for many years, continually experiencing the\r\nnervousness, smarting, pain and burning, with occasional attacks of\r\nurethritis, common to the malady in this form. This made the stricture\r\nalmost unbearable, and he was practically incapacitated for his labor at\r\nthe time that treatment was undertaken in our Institution. He had been\r\nto the Hot Springs and in the care of other physicians with no\r\nsatisfactory results. The relief of the stricture by our new and\r\npainless method was followed by very great improvement in his condition,\r\nafter which appropriate remedies for the rheumatism were administered,\r\nand the result was a very gratifying and satisfactory relief from his\r\ndifficulty. Patient afterwards embarked in business as a proprietor of a\r\nhotel of his own, and has been ever since very active in carrying on the\r\nbusiness, and extremely successful. The stricture showed no tendency to\r\nrecur, as is commonly the case where it is cured by other methods than\r\nemployed by us.

RETENTION OF URINE.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: E.A. Brown, Esq.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--I had been a terrible sufferer for many years with Bladder\r\ntrouble. I had experienced the greatest discomfort, and tried in vain to\r\nfind relief. I was persuaded to go to the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical\r\nInstitute, I went and while there submitted to a course of treatment\r\nthat gave me relief, and was entirely satisfactory. Three years have\r\nelapsed and I continue well. I take the greatest pleasure in making\r\npublic my cure. No sufferer going there can fail to receive all the\r\nbenefit to be derived from medical treatment. The staff of physicians\r\nare skillful and of large experience; the attendants kind and attentive,\r\nand the Institution, in all its appointments, not to be excelled in the\r\ncountry. I had been told by other physicians, Jealous at your success,\r\nnot to go to your place, but I am now more than pleased that I\r\ndisregarded their advice.\r\n\r\n    E.A. BROWN,\r\n    Corfu, N.Y.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRUPTURE. (BREACH OR HERNIA.)\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the term _Hernia_, we mean a tumor, which is formed by the\r\ndisplacement of the intestines, the omentum (covering of the bowels), or\r\nboth, and which protrudes from the abdominal cavity. The most common\r\nvarieties are _umbilical, inguinal_ and _femoral_ hernia. Children are\r\nmost subject to umbilical, males to inguinal, and females to femoral,\r\nhernia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.\r\nIndirect Inguinal Hernia.\r\n\r\nSketched from a case subsequently\r\ncured by our improved method\r\nof treatment. ]\r\n\r\nCAUSES. These are either _predisposing_ or _exciting_. Any thing which\r\noccasions general or local muscular debility, as dropsy, pregnancy,\r\nabscesses, wounds, obstructions to natural evacuations, etc., is a\r\npredisposing cause of hernia. The exciting cause is pressure applied to\r\nthe contents of the abdomen, as straining in evacuating the bowels and\r\nbladder, lifting heavy weights, or violent physical exertion.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS. The only characteristic symptom of hernia is the presentation\r\nof an elastic, or doughy tumor of variable size, which either gradually\r\nor suddenly makes its appearance. There is flatulence, uneasiness, and\r\nsometimes pain in the abdomen.\r\n\r\nSharp and dull pains frequently recurring and confined to the locations\r\nwhere ruptures appear should receive attention. Examination will not\r\ninfrequently reveal a small enlargement. If a hernia, this will usually\r\ndisappear after a night's rest and may not be again noticed until the\r\nnext day, or for several days. On coughing, with the finger applied to\r\nthe enlargement, a sensation of an impulse (succussion), or slight\r\nadditional protrusion will be felt\r\n\r\nThe trouble appears at any time of life, an analysis of seventy thousand\r\ncases indicating that it is most common in debilitated persons, and that\r\nthere is a constant decrease in the frequency of the affection from the\r\nfirst to the thirteenth year, after which rupture is more and more\r\nfrequently met with as age advances.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.\r\n\r\nThis figure illustrates a case of Femoral\r\nHernia which was radically cured by our\r\nimproved method. This tumor is a little\r\nlower on the thigh than in cases of inguinal\r\nhernia. Femoral Hernia is most common\r\nto females, and inguinal in males.]\r\n\r\nINGUINAL HERNIA (see Fig. 1) is more common than all other forms of\r\nrupture. It is more frequently met with in men, and when severe there is\r\nusually a mass of intestine which falls into the scrotum and has an evil\r\neffect, by pressing upon the testicle. The protrusion follows the\r\nspermatic vessels and hence it usually appears low down in the abdomen\r\nand on one or both sides of the pubic bone.\r\n\r\nFEMORAL HERNIA (see Fig. 2), most common in women of mature life, is\r\nfelt as a lump below the strong ligament in the groin which forms the\r\nline of separation between the thigh and the abdomen. On its outer side\r\nand close to it can be felt the beating or pulsation of the large artery\r\nof the thigh.\r\n\r\nUMBILICAL HERNIA (see Fig. 3) appears at or near the navel and is most\r\ncommon in children. It may be present from birth, or it may result from\r\nfretting and crying at any period of childhood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.\r\n\r\nUMBILICAL HERNIA.\r\n\r\nSketched from a case subsequently\r\ncured by our new method.]\r\n\r\nSufferers from any form of rupture are constantly subject to the danger\r\nof strangulation. This occurs when, from any cause the free return of\r\nthe contents of the protruded part of the intestine is prevented. It is\r\nan accident of a serious nature, inasmuch as nearly fifty per cent. die\r\nif not carefully operated upon, and with the most skillful treatment,\r\none in four cases terminates in death.\r\n\r\nEvery individual should guard against rupture by maintaining, by proper\r\nexercise, diet, and rest, a condition of vigor and tonicity of the\r\nmuscular system.\r\n\r\nWhen debilitated, all strains and exertions should be care fully avoided\r\nuntil the health is built up, and the relaxation overcome.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. The palliative treatment of hernia is by _reduction_ and\r\n_retention_. Reduction consists in returning the protruding intestine to\r\nits proper place through the opening by which it escaped. This is\r\naccomplished either by manipulation or by a surgical operation.\r\nRetention is effected by wearing a mechanical appliance called a\r\n_truss_.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the tumor protrudes, or the \"bowel comes down,\" the patient\r\nshould assume the recumbent posture, with his shoulders and feet\r\nelevated. The patient or an attendant should grasp the hernia, and with\r\ngentle, but gradually increasing pressure upon the tumor attempt to\r\nreplace it. At the same time let the patient knead the bowels upward by\r\npressing upon the integument, so that the intestine may, as far as\r\npossible, be pushed away from the point of protrusion. Sometimes the\r\ncontraction of the muscular fibres at a point where the hernia makes its\r\nexit is so great that the tumor cannot be replaced. In this case the\r\nsystem should be relaxed with lobelia (not given in doses to produce\r\nvomiting), and as soon as the patient is thoroughly under its influence,\r\nthe manipulations may be resumed. When there is any difficulty\r\nexperienced in putting back the \"breach,\" or rupture, professional\r\nassistance should be promptly summoned. After the reduction of the\r\nrupture, a truss should be properly adapted, applied, and constantly\r\nworn, to prevent the protrusion of the intestine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.\r\nThe above cut fairly illustrates a case of Double\r\nInguinal Hernia, complicated with Hydrocele,\r\ncured at the Invalids' Hotel\r\nand Surgical Institute.]\r\n\r\nOf the latter instruments there are several hundred varieties for sale\r\nthroughout the country. With the exception of about one-half dozen\r\nforms, which embody the true principles of a proper truss, they are,\r\nwithout exception, harmful. Unless proper support be given to the walls\r\nof the abdomen, and that without constant pressure, a truss does harm;\r\nthen, too, the shape of the pad must be such as to avoid pressure where\r\nit is not required; otherwise, as in the case where a small ring is worn\r\nupon a finger, there is a gradual loss of strength and a depression\r\nformed in the healthy tissue, which can be plainly seen and felt. In\r\nthis way trusses do harm, and such evil consequences may follow the\r\n_improper_ application of a _good_ truss.\r\n\r\nSURGICAL TREATMENT. When the hernia has become strangulated and cannot\r\nbe returned by manipulation, a surgical operation is necessary. Whenever\r\nthe necessity for such a procedure is apparent, it should be performed\r\n_immediately_, for the greater the delay the greater the liability to\r\nfatal results. The operation consists in cutting down upon the\r\nstrangulated bowel, thus relieving it of its constriction and\r\nfacilitating its replacement. It is a delicate operation, and must be\r\nskillfully performed. After the operation, the patient requires\r\nappropriate hygienic treatment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.\r\n\r\nThis figure illustrates a Double Inguinal\r\nHernia, of large size, which was permanently\r\ncured by our improved method of\r\ntreatment. The left side (_b_) shows the _direct_\r\ndescent of the bowel into (_c_) the scrotum,\r\nwhile on the right side (_a_) the rupture\r\nis indirect, the bowel descending through\r\nthe internal ring and inguinal canal.]\r\n\r\nTHE RADICAL CURE. A small percentage of cures will follow the proper use\r\nof a good truss, and the advertisements of the so-called rupture cures\r\nare founded upon such cases. These impostors pretend that the use of\r\nsome vaunted salve, ointment, or styptic lotion, applied on the outside,\r\nwill heal and cure the deep-seated separation of the muscular fibres.\r\nThe truss in these cases is the curative means in the small number that\r\nare relieved, and for it but few dollars should be charged instead of\r\nthe exorbitant prices demanded by these impostors.\r\n\r\nImprovements in surgery in this age of wonders, have kept apace with the\r\nadvances in electricity and other branches of science. Diseases and\r\ndeformities which only a few years ago were considered incurable are now\r\novercome and cured with certainty and without risk or suffering.\r\nEspecially is this true with reference to hernia or rupture.\r\n\r\nOur specialists have devoted much attention to the radical cure of\r\nrupture, or breach, with the most gratifying results. Formerly we\r\nemployed and advocated the use of the injection treatment only. This\r\nmethod was tested and brought to a most efficient and practical stage,\r\nso that we now apply it in the treatment of over eighty percent. of the\r\ncases that are presented at our Institution. This plan of cure, as used\r\nby us, is a great advance over that of any similar one in use,\r\nthroughout the country. Our fluid is much more safe in its effects,\r\nnever gives rise to the troublesome abscesses and inflammation that is\r\ncommon to the use of the injection fluids that have been advised on the\r\nHeatonian method. The fluid we use is a bland and healing agent, which\r\nproduces an exudation behind the cords that surround the inguinal rings,\r\nand forms a well defined truss pad of moderate size in such position\r\nthat the rupture cannot pass by it and appear externally. It causes also\r\nan adhesive inflammation limited to the hernial sac, that completely\r\ncloses it.\r\n\r\nThis treatment is rendered _entirely painless_ by the use of a solution\r\nwhich is injected underneath the skin with a fine hollow needle attached\r\nto a small syringe, and which tends to produce complete local\r\nanæsthesia, or loss of feeling so that the procedure is thoroughly and\r\ncarefully carried out without any risk or discomfort.\r\n\r\nThe needle used by us for the treatment of the hernia is so perfected\r\nthat any possible injection of the fluid into the abdominal cavity, or\r\nupon the coating of the intestine, is an impossibility, and in no way\r\ncan an injection be made into a blood vessel or nerve so as to produce\r\nany discomfort or trouble. We thus avoid all the risks that pertain to\r\nthe usual plan of injection.\r\n\r\nThere is a small percentage of cases, as before stated, in which this\r\nform of treatment is not likely to give a permanent cure, from the fact\r\nthat the omentum or intestine has become adherent externally, to the\r\nsac, or in the scrotum, to the coverings of the testicle. This makes the\r\ncomplete replacement of the rupture without cutting an impossibility,\r\nand in such cases even where the hernial opening is closed, treatment by\r\ninjection only would not result in a permanent cure.\r\n\r\nOur aim is to treat all cases of rupture that we undertake in such a\r\nmanner that _by no possibility can the deformity return_. We therefore\r\nhave for the cure of these cases another method, by which with our local\r\nanæsthetic fluid, we are able to perform a surgical operation without\r\nany distress whatever to the patient. The greatest risk of the old\r\noperation for rupture was the danger of general anæsthesia with\r\nchloroform or ether, or some similar agent. The great majority of\r\nindividuals cannot bear the inhalation of the large quantities of these\r\nanæsthetics necessary to secure loss of feeling without consequent\r\nnausea, and at times an effect upon the heart that often results\r\nseriously. The risk from the anæsthetic is much greater than from the\r\nsurgical procedure. By our method, this risk is entirely done away with.\r\nThe pain dispelling fluid enables our operator to pursue his method\r\nWITHOUT GIVING THE PATIENT ANY PAIN OR DISCOMFORT WHATEVER. During the\r\noperation he is in full possession of all his faculties, and can assist\r\nin any way desired by coughing, or straining, in order, at any time, to\r\ncomplete the protrusion of the rupture and show its entire extent of\r\nsurface when the sac is laid bare. We then replace the rupture\r\ncompletely; suture the sac so that the rupture will have no pocket into\r\nwhich to descend, and then firmly unite the rings by a plan that we have\r\ninvented, and BY WHICH THEY ARE MADE MORE STRONG AND FIRM THAN IN THEIR\r\nORIGINAL STATE.\r\n\r\nEarly in our experience, and while using the plan of treatment that is\r\nusually employed for the radical cure of rupture, we had occasional\r\nrelapses of the difficulty, but since using our improved method we have\r\nhad no such trouble. We can assure our patients that there is less risk\r\nof the appearance of the rupture at the point where the operation is\r\nperformed than there is of a new breach forming. The success of this\r\ntreatment has been invariable. None of the plans of treatment that we\r\npursue for the cure of rupture tend to keep the patient in bed more than\r\na few hours. There is little or no pain, after either of our plans of\r\ntreatment, and out of the many hundreds which we have treated and\r\nperfectly cured, in no instance have we had any inflammation or serious\r\nmanifestation--there being no fever or general reaction. It is a matter\r\nof great surprise to our patients, who undergo our treatment for the\r\nradical cure of rupture, that by our varied methods, the object is\r\naccomplished with so little discomfort and with no pain whatever.\r\n\r\nFrom two to three weeks' personal attention of our specialist, is\r\nusually all that is required even in the worst cases.\r\n\r\nNO TRUSS IS NEEDED AFTER OUR TREATMENT. WE CONSIDER A CASE CURED ONLY\r\nWHEN THE PATIENT IS ABLE TO DO WITHOUT A TRUSS OR SUPPORT IN ALL THE\r\nUSUAL WALKS AND VOCATIONS OF LIFE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONIALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe testimonials that we append are but a small number out of the great\r\nmass that we have received. A very large percentage of individuals who\r\nhave been treated by us for rupture desire that their disability be held\r\na matter of sacred confidence and with all such we take pleasure in\r\nguarding their confidence with the greatest care. Others are quite\r\nwilling that their experience may be made public in this manner for the\r\nbenefit of similar sufferers.\r\n\r\nIf the following letters had been written by your best known and most\r\nesteemed neighbors they could be no more worthy of your confidence than\r\nthey now are, coming, as they do, from well known, intelligent and\r\ntrustworthy citizens, who, in their several neighborhoods, enjoy the\r\nfullest confidence and respect of all who know them.\r\n\r\n\r\nA LOCOMOTIVE ENGINEER\r\n\r\nTESTIFIES TO HIS CURE OF RUPTURE.

I was talking with\r\nBrother Stagg one day. He asked me \"why I did not go to the Invalids'\r\nHotel and Surgical Institute, at Buffalo, N.Y., and get cured?\" I went,\r\nand in three weeks was cured, so that I could dispose of my truss\r\nentirely.\r\n\r\nI wish to say this comes from me direct; it was my own proposition that\r\nthis letter be made public.\r\n\r\n    Yours respectfully,\r\n    F.S.

I am sound as a dollar. My case was an\r\nextremely troublesome and dangerous one. Many times I required the\r\nassistance of a surgeon to reduce it. No truss would hold it a whole\r\nday.

I had a rupture of\r\ntwenty-seven years' standing, with hemorrhage of the kidney for six\r\nmonths, preceding my visit to your Institute, and was also troubled\r\nbadly with indigestion, all of which ailments had reduced me in strength\r\nand flesh to a mere skeleton. Had been treated by many local physicians,\r\nwho failed to do me any good. I could walk but a very short distance\r\nwhen I left my home on the 8th of July, 1892, for treatment at your\r\nInstitution, with but little faith or hope of ever being any better. But\r\nthrough your skillful treatment I was able to return to my home on the\r\n9th of August, 1892, and consider myself permanently cured, having had\r\nto take no medicine since. Considering my case _almost a miracle_, I\r\ncannot speak too highly of your Institute and skillful treatment, to\r\nwhich I feel that I am indebted for my continued existence.

I did not pay very much attention to this until I\r\nnoticed that it was enlarging. It finally grew so that I could not work.\r\nI used several kinds of trusses that did me no good.\r\n\r\nI went to the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute, and submitted to\r\nan operation which was entirely painless and proved most satisfactory in\r\nevery respect. Since then I have been well and able to do hard work for\r\na man of my age (72). I feel no inconvenience from the rupture.\r\n\r\nI take pleasure in recommending the Institute to all who are in need of\r\nhelp. I can highly recommend the physicians and nurses and the kind\r\nattention I received while there.

Your method of\r\nusing locally cocaine as an anæsthetic is such a decided improvement. I\r\ndid not have to take any dangerous ether or chloroform, but had a small\r\nquantity of medicine injected that made the operation as painless as\r\nthough it was being done on some one else. At the same time I knew\r\neverything and could see what was being done.\r\n\r\nYou have my kindest thanks for the good care and many attentions given\r\nme.

Hartzell, Esq.]\r\n\r\n_To the afflicted_: For sixteen years I was troubled with Hernia, caused\r\nby heavy lifting. It was on the right side and the protrusion sufficient\r\nto extend into the scrotum. I purchased trusses, but none of them could\r\nbe worn with comfort, and I suffered very much. I concluded to go to the\r\nInvalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute and see if I could not obtain\r\nrelief. While there I submitted to an operation. The result was entirely\r\nsatisfactory. The pain in my back subsided; my general health began to\r\ntone up, and in a short time, thanks to the skill of their specialist\r\nand the kind attention of their nurses, I felt like a new man. I take\r\npleasure in highly recommending the Institution to all the afflicted. I\r\nfeel confident that all the benefit to be derived from medical or\r\nsurgical treatment is to be received at the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical\r\nInstitute.\r\n\r\n    Yours respectfully,\r\n    M.G.

Hartley, Esq.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1883, I became ruptured on the _left_ side. I immediately\r\nwrote you (having heard of your fame in curing all kinds of diseases)\r\nfor your terms of treatment which I received by return mail, you also\r\nstating you were positive you could cure me. Through unavoidable\r\ncircumstances I was unable to come to your Institution until December,\r\n1886. During this time I had tried wearing a truss, which only made it\r\nworse, and very much aggravated my complaint as it was impossible to\r\nhold the rupture in its place. However I arrived at the Invalids' Hotel\r\non December 8th, 1886. On being examined by one of your staff, I was\r\npronounced a bad case, but by your mode of treatment you could cure it.\r\nI was therefore, operated upon by one of your specialists, without any\r\ncutting however and comparatively little pain, by your scientific\r\nmethod, and in thirty days returned home cured. The time I had to remain\r\nthere, I believe, was much longer than most persons treated for the same\r\ncomplaint.\r\n\r\nSince then I have worked very hard sometimes (my occupation being that\r\nof a farmer,) so much so that I became ruptured on the _right_ side\r\nthree years ago,--the other side remaining perfectly sound without any\r\nprotection. I considered myself very unfortunate in being in this\r\nposition again, fortunate in knowing where to go for relief, and very\r\nsoon was back in your Institution where I was successfully treated and\r\nperfectly cured and am to-day a sound man and able to do any kind of\r\nwork on my farm.\r\n\r\nI write this testimonial for the sake of suffering humanity, and wish\r\nyou to use it in any way that the greatest number of persons may read\r\nit. As for myself, I would not be in the condition I once was and not\r\nknow of your Institution for all I could see. I not only recommend your\r\nInstitution for the complaint of which I was cured but for all chronic\r\ndiseases or anything requiring a skillful surgical operation, believing\r\nyour Staff of Physicians and Surgeons to be second to none anywhere.\r\nYour nurses and attendants, and every accommodation, also, being all\r\nthat is necessary to make your Institution everything that its name\r\nimplies--a complete Invalids Hotel and Surgical Institute.\r\n\r\n    Respectfully yours,\r\n    DAVID HARTLEY,\r\n    P.O. Box 84, Wyoming, Out.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I have also received much benefit from taking your \"Golden Medical\r\nDiscovery\" for dyspepsia and liver complaint, and being broken down\r\ngenerally.

The Invalids' Hotel is a place as much like home as it is\r\npossible for such an institution to be. The physicians and surgeons are\r\nall expert specialists and thoroughly efficient; the nurses are very\r\ncompetent, attentive and kind; and, in fact, the whole _personnel_ of\r\nthe Invalids' Hotel endeavor to do their best to make the patients feel\r\nlike being at home. I always felt while there as if I was one of the\r\nfamily. I gladly recommend your Institution to all persons who are\r\nafflicted with any kind of chronic disease, for from my own experience I\r\n_know_ the professional staff will do all which they promise to do.\r\nPlease accept my thanks for the speedy benefits and perfect cure of my\r\ndiseases, and I think your Institution is worthy of the highest\r\nendorsement.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly,\r\n    WILLIAM HENKEL,\r\n    No. 1917 Congress Street,\r\n    St. Louis, Mo.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRANGULATED RUPTURE OR BREACH\r\n\r\nIN A CHILD TWO YEARS OLD, CURED.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, 663 Main St., Buffalo, N.Y.:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rev. R. Krause, Esq.]\r\n\r\n_Dear Sirs_--Our boy is, since the operation, quite well and healthier\r\nthan ever before, so that I presume, the rupture, or a part of it, may\r\nhave existed since his birth. Even that small lump in the groin has, as\r\nmuch as I can feel by touching, completely disappeared. I take this\r\nopportunity of expressing my heart-felt thanks for the kind and\r\nchristian-like treatment my wife and boy experienced from you and the\r\nnurses. God bless you and let you live long for the welfare of suffering\r\nmen. Dr. Pierce's Invalids' Hotel of Buffalo, N.Y., deserves to be\r\nrecommended to every sufferer of whatever disease. Eight years ago I\r\nunderwent a successful operation, saving my body a member. The dangerous\r\noutgrowth, which made the operation a necessity, never returned. In\r\nregard to your specialist, I wish to remark, that his skillful way of\r\nperforming operations reminded me very much of Bernard von Langenbeck,\r\nprofessor of surgery in the University of Berlin, where I was a student.\r\nHe is just as tender and sympathetic with his patients as that famous\r\ndirector of the Prussian Royal Clinical Hospital has been. As to the\r\nmedicines of Dr. Pierce, I recommended them to members of my\r\ncongregation, who told me that they did them good. Dr. Bastian, of\r\nDansville, N.Y., a druggist, told me that your medicines are bought by\r\nthe same persons again and again. I consider this to be the best\r\nrecommendation. A medicine which is of no effect will not be bought a\r\nsecond time by the same person.\r\n\r\n    Yours, REV. RICHARD KRAUSE, Portway, N.Y.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mrs. Krause.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Master H.

Nitschke, Esq.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--I take pleasure in reporting that I have not worn the truss\r\nfor a long period, and that I have been at work steadily at my business\r\nof binding and printing, running a large establishment, for over four\r\nyears, without any trouble whatever from the rupture. It has remained\r\npermanently and perfectly cured. You will remember my case as a most\r\nsevere one. I am a man of sixty years of age, and the disease had been\r\nthe source of serious discomfort to me since childhood. The protrusion\r\nwas the size of a man's head, and could not be replaced. I was forced to\r\ngive up all exercise, and suffered much at my daily work from\r\ninconvenience and pain. Any injury upon the protrusion, which could not\r\nalways be protected, was followed with much discomfort, and my general\r\nhealth was seriously affected. The passage of the food through the\r\nconfined intestines was a painful process often times, and kept me in\r\ngreat misery. I am thankful to state that since your operation the\r\nrupture has remained sound and well, and I have been relieved of all\r\ndifficulty of the kind. I now enjoy excellent health, and am at my\r\nbusiness daily from twelve to sixteen hours, and on my feet constantly,\r\nyet without any manifestations whatever of the re-appearance of the\r\nrupture. You have my most sincere gratitude for the skillful operation\r\nand the good care received in your Institution while there. I can\r\nrecommend your nurses and physicians most highly, and think your\r\nInstitution is unequaled in this country.\r\n\r\n    With many good wishes, I am,\r\n    Very truly yours, DANIEL NITSCHKE,\r\n    2067 Franklin Ave., Toledo, Ohio.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPLICATION OF DISEASES.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A.

I\r\nhad a rupture that was very large and difficult to hold in place.\r\nTrusses of all kinds were tried. They were painful and would not hold\r\nit.

Wood, Esq.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen_--In the hope that some sufferer from hernia may be induced\r\nto take your treatment for that disease, I send you this certificate,\r\ncontaining a synopsis of my case and cure of the same. My life was a\r\nliving death for years. I had almost lost all hope of ever being cured,\r\nand was plunged in despair, as I had tried so many trusses, appliances\r\nand remedies, each one in successive repetition, a failure. In January\r\nand February of the year '89, I entered your Institution for treatment,\r\nmy malady being an inguinal hernia on the right side, of twenty years'\r\nstanding--from childhood. I was then impressed with the feeling that it\r\nwas my last chance, and that it would be my last effort, and to be\r\ncandid I had very little hope that a cure would be effected. To me my\r\ncondition seemed appalling, as I dare not eat, drink, laugh, exercise or\r\nperform any of the functions of life without having to reduce my\r\nrupture, frequently as often as forty or fifty times _per diem_, while\r\non occasions the reduction would occupy hours of untold agony. No truss\r\nor appliance that I could get would retain the rupture, and I had tried\r\nall sorts as fast as they came to my knowledge. Marvelous as it may\r\nappear to all sufferers from this distressing affliction, I was\r\ndischarged from your Institute in thirty days, a well and sound man, and\r\nonly from memory and the record do I know that I was ever ruptured. I\r\nhave at times since performed some of the hardest kinds of work for long\r\nperiods, but no sign of weakness has ever appeared. I do not consider\r\nthe necessary operation performed as attended with any danger; it is no\r\ncomparison to the chances a person takes who in the daily walks of life\r\nis tortured with a rupture.\r\n\r\nWhile an inmate of your Institution, I was accorded the kindest and most\r\nconsiderate treatment from all members of your staff and employees with\r\nwhom I came in contact. I consider the appointments and cuisine of the\r\nestablishment as perfection. You are at liberty to make the fullest and\r\nfreest use of this testimonial you may see fit in your judgment, and I\r\nwill cheerfully answer any communication from any sufferer referred to\r\nme for more explicit testimony.\r\n\r\n    I am, Sincerely yours, HENRY WOOD.\r\n    Mason Valley, Nev.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCROUP, MEMBRANOUS AND SPASMODIC.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.\r\nFalse Membrane in Croup. From a specimen\r\nin Dr. Gross' cabinet.]\r\n\r\nEvery family should be made acquainted with the symptoms and treatment\r\nof this disease. Especially is this true in the case of those living\r\nremote from a physician. From the lack of this knowledge on the part of\r\nparents, many a little one has perished before medical assistance could\r\nbe obtained. In some of its forms its progress is very rapid, and,\r\nunless relief is obtained in a few moments, or hours at the most, death\r\nensues.\r\n\r\nThere are several quite distinct pathological conditions of the vocal\r\nand respiratory organs which have, in popular parlance, been designated\r\nas croup. But two of these are worthy of consideration here. These are\r\n_true_ or _membranous_ croup, in which a false, semi-organized membrane\r\nis formed, and _spasmodic croup_. Both may result fatally, but the\r\nformer is much the more dangerous.\r\n\r\nMEMBRANOUS CROUP is supposed to originate in the trachea, from which, as\r\nit progresses, it often extends upward to the larynx, and downward to\r\nthe bronchial tubes. It is the result of severe inflammation of the\r\nmucous membrane, and is characterized by the formation of a false\r\nmembrane, which covers or lines the inner surface of the true structure\r\n(see Fig. 1). It is formed of a coagulable, semi-fluid exudation from\r\nthe mucous membrane. On being brought to the surface and into contact\r\nwith the inspired air, this substance grows thick and tough, or\r\nleathery, as we find it. It is the obstruction in the respiratory canal\r\nwhich this foreign matter causes that gives rise to the labored\r\nbreathing, and the ringing, brassy cough, together with the crowing or\r\nwhistling inspiration characteristic of croup. Before recovery can take\r\nplace this membrane must be detached and expelled. The cough is nature's\r\neffort to accomplish this work.\r\n\r\nThe formation of this adventitious membrane in the larynx is attended\r\nwith more danger than when it is confined to the trachea. In most cases\r\nin which the disease has had a very speedily fatal termination, an\r\nexamination has shown that the larynx was its chief seat.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS. True croup is generally preceded by what is known as \"a cold.\"\r\nThe child coughs, sneezes, and is hoarse. It is the hoarseness and the\r\npeculiar _character_ of the cough which indicate the tendency to croup.\r\nThis has been already described. In addition, the child is restless,\r\nfretful and feverish. The disease makes rapid strides. Finally the cough\r\nceases to be loud and barking, and is very much suppressed; the voice is\r\nalmost gone; the face is very pale; the head thrown back; the nostrils\r\ndilated and in perpetual motion, the pulse at the wrist very feeble,\r\ngreat exhaustion, more or less delirium, and, finally, death comes to\r\nthe relief of the little sufferer. Convulsions sometimes occur in the\r\nlast stages, and soon terminate fatally.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. No time should be lost in commencing treatment. Hot\r\nfomentations should be applied to the throat and upper portions of the\r\nchest. The free inhalation of steam should be employed early. The\r\nfollowing treatment has been found very effectual in membranous croup,\r\nand is recommended by the highest authorities: Yellow subsulphate of\r\nmercury, or turpeth mineral, three to five grains, depending upon the\r\nage of the child, for one dose. If it does not cause vomiting in fifteen\r\nminutes, give a second dose. This, however, is seldom necessary. If the\r\nturpeth mineral cannot be obtained, sulphate of copper or sulphate of\r\nzinc may be given instead, as directed under the head of Emetics, in\r\nPart III, Chapter II. If there be a quick pulse, hot skin, a hurried\r\nbreathing, and an occasional ringing cough, the child should be kept in\r\nbed, comfortably covered, but not overloaded with clothes, and the\r\ntincture or fluid extract of veratrum viride administered as follows:\r\nTake fluid extract of veratrum, five drops; sweet spirits of nitre, one\r\nteaspoonful; pure water, twenty teaspoonfuls; mix, sweeten with white\r\nsugar, and give a teaspoonful of the mixture every half-hour to two\r\nhours, according to the age of the child and the severity of the case.\r\nIf there be great prostration, with cold extremities, the carbonate of\r\nammonia should be administered, in doses of from one to two grains,\r\nevery second hour, in gum arabic mucilage. Quinine is a valuable remedy,\r\nand is tolerated in large doses. The patient's body should be frequently\r\nsponged with warm water in which a sufficient quantity of saleratus or\r\nordinary baking-soda has been dissolved to render it quite strongly\r\nalkaline. If the bowels be constipated they should be moved by an\r\ninjection of starch-water. Beef tea and other concentrated, supporting\r\ndiet should be administrated. In those cases in which there is a\r\ntendency to croup, the Golden Medical Discovery, together with iron and\r\nthe bitter tonics, should be given to build up the system and counteract\r\nsuch tendency. The treatment which we have advised has been put to the\r\nseverest tests in the most severe forms of the disease, and has resulted\r\nmost successfully. If, however, in any case it does not give prompt\r\nrelief, our advice is to lose no time in summoning a physician who is\r\nknown to be skilled in the treatment of diseases of children.\r\n\r\nSPASMODIC CROUP. In this affection no false membrane is formed. It seems\r\nto have a nervous origin. Most frequently the child is awakened in the\r\nnight by a sense of suffocation. He may cry out that he is choking. The\r\ncountenance is livid, the breathing is hurried and each respiration is\r\nattended by a crowing sound. The child has fits of coughing or crying,\r\nand makes vehement struggles to recover his breath. This complaint,\r\nunlike croup, is unattended by fever, it being of a purely spasmodic\r\ncharacter with no inflammation.\r\n\r\nApply hot fomentations to the throat, and give frequent small doses of\r\ntincture or fluid extract or syrup of lobelia, to produce slight nausea;\r\nor, better still, an acetic syrup of blood-root, made by adding one\r\nteaspoonful of the crushed or powdered root to one gill of vinegar and\r\nfour teaspoonfuls of white sugar. Heat this mixture to the boiling\r\npoint, strain, and administer from one-fourth to one teaspoonful every\r\nhalf-hour or hour. Slight nausea should be kept up, but it is\r\nunnecessary to produce vomiting. This is usually all the treatment that\r\nis required.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHOOPING-COUGH. (PERTUSSIS.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is primarily a disease of the nervous system, involving the\r\nrespiratory organs through the medium of the pneumogastric nerve. It is\r\nconsidered a disease of childhood, though we have met with it in _old\r\nage_. It is eminently a contagious affection, and occurs generally but\r\nonce during life.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS. It is at first manifested by a catarrhal cough, gradually\r\ndeveloped. After a while it becomes paroxysmal, generally worse at\r\nnight. The cough is severe, and long-continued; when a prolonged\r\ninspiration occurs, it is accompanied by a peculiar shrill sound, the\r\ncharacteristic _whoop_, which, when once heard, is never forgotten. The\r\ncough is attended by a copious secretion of glairy mucus, which is\r\nbrought up at the latter part of the paroxysm. During, or at the end of\r\nthe paroxysm, vomiting frequently occurs, and sometimes nosebleed. The\r\ncough is so severe at times, that the patient turns purple, gasps for\r\nbreath, and presents all the symptoms of suffocation. Bronchitis\r\nsometimes is a troublesome complication. Immediately preceding a\r\nparoxysm of coughing a sense of impending danger appears to seize the\r\nchild, and it runs to its mother, or grasps some support, as if for\r\nprotection. Until the paroxysmal character and peculiar _whoop_ is\r\ndeveloped, the disease is diagnosed with difficulty.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. We have found the Golden Medical Discovery to modify the\r\ndisease and cut it short. The philosophy of its action can be readily\r\nunderstood by its effect on the pneumogastric nerve, as explained under\r\nconsumption and bronchitis. Jaborandi, described under the head of\r\ndiaphoretics, often speedily arrests this disease. The employment of an\r\ninfusion of red clover blossoms, in small doses, is of undoubted value\r\nin modifying the irritation of the air-passages, and may be used to good\r\nadvantage with, or in alternation with the Golden Medical Discovery.\r\nExposure to cold and wet should be avoided.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOSEBLEED.\r\n\r\n\r\nHemorrhage from the nose is commonly the result either of a catarrhal or\r\nan inflammatory condition of the nasal mucous membrane. Individuals are\r\nsusceptible to it who are oppressed by fever or constitutional diseases\r\nthat reduce the strength. There is also a condition of the nervous\r\nsystem in which there is congestion of the nerve centres which favors\r\nmanifestations of this somewhat troublesome difficulty.\r\n\r\nCAUSES. In some instances an examination of the nose will reveal the\r\npresence of a small point of congested vessels, usually about the size\r\nof a split pea. Upon this portion of the mucous membrane small scabs\r\nform, and at any time when they may be dislodged, by accident or\r\notherwise, a hemorrhage will ensue.\r\n\r\nThe constitutional conditions that produce the tendency to hemorrhage\r\nare most important. In individuals of a debilitated condition, it\r\nresults from the lack of a proper amount of fibrin in the blood. Where\r\nthe blood becomes thin, or loses a large share of its red corpuscles,\r\nthe individual is pale, and hemorrhages are frequent from the mucous\r\nsurfaces of any portion of the body, the nasal mucous surface being\r\nespecially liable to such attacks.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. This is local and constitutional. Where there is\r\nconstitutional imperfection, it should be remedied. Usually in young\r\nwomen there is some difficulty with the ovarian or uterine circulation,\r\nand the attack of hemorrhage from the nose is reflex in its character,\r\nappearing just before or at the time of the menstrual flow, accompanied\r\nwith troublesome headache. The correction of this form is by the use of\r\nthe \"Favorite Prescription\" and \"Golden Medical Discovery,\" using of\r\neach a teaspoonful three times a day, taking the \"Prescription\" before\r\nmeals and the \"Discovery\" after meals. If the bowels are constipated,\r\nthe \"Pellets\" should be employed, in order to overcome any congestion of\r\nthe liver which favors the manifestation of nosebleed. In children there\r\nis usually a debilitated state of the system, which is best remedied by\r\nthe use of a half teaspoonful dose of the \"Discovery,\" taken three times\r\na day, after meals, with sweetened water. This treatment should be\r\ncontinued for a month or six weeks. By this means the blood-making\r\norgans rapidly improve in their activity and functions, the blood\r\nbecomes rich in corpuscles and fibrin, thus strengthening the walls of\r\nthe blood-vessels and tending to prevent a hemorrhage following undue\r\nexcitement or injury. With men the use of laxatives is of great\r\nimportance. One or more of the \"Pellets,\" taken on retiring at night,\r\nare most beneficial. Where the blood is not up to the standard of\r\npurity, even though the individual be fleshy, the \"Discovery\" should be\r\nused, a teaspoonful or two, three times a day, after meals, in\r\nconjunction with plenty of outdoor exercise and the best of food. Where\r\nthe hemorrhages occur in those having too much blood, the diet must be\r\ncorrected by the use of vegetables and fruit, diminishing the amount of\r\nmeat and pastries to a minimum. The amount of fibrin should also be\r\nincreased by the use of the \"Golden Medical Discovery.\"\r\n\r\nLOCAL TREATMENT. Of those applied directly to the membrane, Dr. Sage's\r\nCatarrh Remedy, used according to the directions which wrap the bottle,\r\nis excellent in bringing about a normal condition of the mucous\r\nsurfaces. Following this, a small amount of Subnitrate of Bismuth may be\r\nsnuffed into each nostril. Usually the amount required to cover a\r\nthree-cent silver piece is sufficient. The powder dries the surface and\r\nfavors the speedy formation of a coagulum, or clotted covering, which\r\neffectually checks any further hemorrhage. The application of a firm\r\ncompress to the upper lip will also diminish the flow of blood through\r\nthe arteries that run to the anterior portion of the mucous surface.\r\nGood effects often follow the use of a small piece of ice applied to the\r\nnape of the neck. This, with a reclining posture, will cause contraction\r\nof the blood-vessels. If the Subnitrate of Bismuth is not to be readily\r\nobtained, the use of any other powder such as starch, finely divided and\r\nbaked so as to be free from a tendency to form starch paste when applied\r\nto a mucous surface, is equally good. Well-browned flour is also\r\nserviceable. The use of the contents of a puff-ball, which contains many\r\nmillions of fine spores, has been employed from time immemorial. The use\r\nof such drying powders tends to favor the speedy formation of clots.\r\nWhere the small points of engorged vessels are to be readily reached,\r\nuse a solution of the Tincture of Chloride of Iron, one part in four of\r\nwater, applying with a small pledget of soft cotton wrapped about, or\r\nfastened to, the end of a pencil or stick. In this way the solution may\r\nbe applied in very small amount to the spot where the hemorrhage\r\nappears, and will give immunity from future attacks. Any of the styptics\r\n(see pages 320-325) can be called into service. Those who have the\r\nadvantage of the city drug store may use a solution of basic ferric\r\nsulphate (Monsell's solution), or the spray of a three or four percent.\r\nsolution of cocaine. The latter is one of the most pleasant and\r\neffective remedies in these emergencies. Before its administration the\r\nnasal cavity should be cleansed by snuffing up the nostrils salt and\r\nwarm water. When washed, immediately apply the spray. If the\r\nconstitutional condition which led to the hemorrhage continues, the\r\ngeneral remedies--of which the \"Golden Medical Discovery\" is the most\r\nefficacious--should be administered. This agent increases the number of\r\nred blood corpuscles, and enriches the blood in fibrin, so that the\r\nrelief obtained is absolutely permanent.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLAMMATION OF THE STOMACH. (GASTRITIS.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGastritis is generally defined as an inflammation of the mucous membrane\r\nof the stomach. However, the cellular, muscular, and serous tissues are\r\nall liable to be more or less affected. Gastritis may be either _acute_\r\nor _chronic_. Either form is a distinct modification of disease,\r\nmanifesting peculiar symptoms and requiring special remedies.\r\n\r\n_Acute Gastritis_ generally occurs as a result or complication of other\r\ndiseases. It is an occasional feature In scarlatina, serious cases of\r\nbilious fever, and in cutaneous affections of every description. The\r\nmucous membrane of the stomach is placed in intimate communication with\r\nall the vital organs, by means of the nerves of the solar-plexus, hence\r\nthe sympathy between the stomach and skin, and the morbid condition of\r\nthe stomach occasioned by disease of other organs.\r\n\r\nTHE EARLY SYMPTOMS of acute gastritis are a burning sensation in the\r\nstomach, accompanied by nausea and frequent vomiting. The respiratory\r\nmovements are rapid and shallow, the pulse is hard and short, and as the\r\ndisease progresses, becomes small, frequent, and thready. The tongue\r\nusually retains its natural appearance, but it is sometimes dry and\r\ntinged with a vivid scarlet at the tip and edges. Intense thirst and\r\nhiccough are occasional symptoms. The facial expression is haggard, and\r\nindicative of the most intense suffering. The stomach will not retain\r\nthe mildest liquids. In the early stages of the disease, the ejections\r\nconsist of chyme and mucus, streaked with blood. As it progresses, the\r\nvomiting becomes a sort of regurgitation, the contents of the stomach\r\nbeing ejected without any apparent nausea or effort. The ejections then\r\nconsist of a dark-colored granular matter, resembling what is known in\r\nyellow fever as _black-vomit_.\r\n\r\nCAUSES. Formerly it was supposed that this was a very common disorder,\r\nand the term _acute gastritis_ was applied to every development of\r\nsymptomatic fever. But late clinical and pathological investigations\r\nclearly indicate that acute gastritis is of rare occurrence. It may be\r\ncaused by the excessive and habitual use of alcoholic drinks, especially\r\nif taken without food, by copious draughts of cold water, or by intense\r\nemotions. But its _general_ cause is the ingestion of irritating and\r\ncorrosive poisons.\r\n\r\nWhere the former causes are known not to exist, the presence of poison\r\nshould always be suspected. As the cause sometimes becomes a matter of\r\nlegal investigation, it is very important that the practitioner should\r\nbe able to determine the _real_ origin. If caused by poison, the disease\r\nis very suddenly developed, the patient complaining of a very intense\r\nburning sensation in the throat and the lining membrane of the mouth,\r\nwhich will generally show the action of the poison. A diarrhea is also\r\nmore apt to accompany the disease. If inorganic or vegetable poisons are\r\nknown or suspected irritants, the appropriate antidotes should be\r\npromptly administered. For a list of the principal poisons and their\r\nantidotes, with practical suggestions for treatment, the reader is\r\nreferred to the article in this volume, on Accidents and Emergencies.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. The inflammation should be allayed, and a tea made of\r\npeach-tree leaves is very serviceable. Small pieces of ice, swallowed,\r\nwill generally allay the thirst and vomiting, and a mucilage of\r\nslippery-elm is very soothing to the inflamed mucous membrane. This is\r\nan important disease, and its management should be entrusted to a\r\nskillful physician.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONIC INFLAMMATION OF THE STOMACH.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chronic Gastritis_ is sometimes mistaken for dyspepsia or gastralgia.\r\nIt is very necessary to discriminate between these diseases, as the\r\nappropriate remedies of the latter will often only aggravate and augment\r\nthe former.\r\n\r\nA chronic inflammation of the stomach is a very common affection and has\r\nmany phases, but the term chronic gastritis is applied only to that\r\nspecies of inflammation occasioned and accompanied by irritation. It is\r\nseldom a result of the _acute_ form.\r\n\r\nTHE SYMPTOMS of chronic gastritis are various and sometimes vague. Among\r\nthose which are prominent we may mention an irregular appetite. At times\r\nit is voracious and the patient will consume every available article of\r\ndiet, while at others he will experience nausea and disgust at the sight\r\nof food. Even when very hungry, one mouthful of food will sometimes\r\nproduce satiety and cause vomiting. The appearance of the tongue is\r\nvariable, sometimes natural, at others thickly coated. The desire for\r\ndrink is capricious, varying from intense thirst to indifference.\r\nAnother prominent symptom is a sense of heaviness and heat in the\r\nepigastric region, after partaking of food. Often a small quantity, as a\r\nteaspoonful of milk, will produce a sensation of weight, as a heavy ball\r\nlying at the pit of the stomach. This symptom is frequently accompanied\r\nby a frontal headache, and a small and wiry pulse. Dull or shooting\r\npains are experienced in the stomach and between the shoulders, and the\r\npatient becomes weary, melancholy, and emaciated.\r\n\r\nCAUSES. The general cause of chronic gastritis is excess in eating or\r\ndrinking, and the use of alcoholic liquors. We have known it to be\r\nproduced by drinking _hard_ cider. Great mental excitement predisposes\r\nthe system to this affection. Occasionally it is a result of febrile\r\ndiseases, as scarlatina, typhoid fever, etc. In some families there is a\r\nconstitutional tendency to its development.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. All medicines which tend to irritate the stomach, should be\r\nstudiously avoided. The bowels should be kept regular, and the skin\r\nclean by frequent bathing. Stimulants of all kinds must be avoided. As a\r\nprinciple article of diet, we would recommend milk and farinaceous\r\narticles. If these precautions be observed, nature will sometimes effect\r\na cure. Lime water and the subnitrate of bismuth, in twenty-grain doses\r\nthree or four times a day, are useful to allay irritation. Other\r\nsuggestions applicable to its domestic management, maybe found under the\r\nhygienic and medicinal treatment of dyspepsia, to which we refer the\r\nreader.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEURALGIA OF THE STOMACH. (GASTRALGIA.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGastralgia is a neuralgic affection of the stomach, unaccompanied by\r\ninflammation. It is sometimes mistaken for chronic gastritis, although\r\nthere is a marked difference in the symptoms.\r\n\r\nA PROMINENT SYMPTOM OF GASTRALGIA is a _paroxysmal_ pain radiating from\r\nthe epigastric region, to all parts of the thoracic cavity. The pain is\r\nsometimes lessened by walking, lying on left side, or by gentle\r\npressure, and usually abates after eating, but is renewed in a few\r\nhours. The patient occasionally experiences a sense of heaviness at the\r\npit of the stomach, nausea, and frequent salty eructations. The tongue\r\nis white, the appetite variable, and there is no desire for liquids. The\r\nsleep is usually refreshing, and when not suffering from acute pain, the\r\npatient is apparently well.\r\n\r\nThe _distinguishing_ symptom of this disease is a feeling of intense\r\ndespondency, and, sometimes, a morbid fear of death.\r\n\r\nAn effectual method of distinguishing between gastralgia and chronic\r\ngastritis is by the administration of an alcoholic stimulant. If\r\ngastritis be the affection the pain will be augmented; whereas, if it be\r\ngastralgia, it will be relieved.\r\n\r\nCAUSE. The cause of gastralgia is a local or sympathetic irritation of\r\nthe nerves distributed to the stomach.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. The pain of gastralgia is sometimes allayed by using half a\r\nteaspoonful of subcarbonate of bismuth, and repeating the dose, if the\r\nattack is not relieved. The following is a very effectual remedy: take\r\ntwenty grains of quinine, combined with one drachm of prussiate of iron,\r\nand divide it into ten powders, and administer a powder every three\r\nhours until the pain is completely arrested. Temporary relief may be\r\ngiven by administering one-quarter of a grain of morphine, or ten to\r\ntwenty drops of chloroform in a teaspoonful of glycerine, slightly\r\ndiluted, taken in one dose. One of the most effective remedies for\r\npreventing a return of the attacks is that invigorating tonic and\r\nalterative, the \"Golden Medical Discovery.\" The patient should be\r\ncareful in diet, and not eat too much food, which should not only be of\r\na nutritious kind, but easy of digestion. Cleanliness, suitable\r\nclothing, bodily warmth, exercise, and rest must not be neglected.\r\nSometimes it is lingering and requires long persistence in hygienic and\r\nmedicinal treatment. Everything tending to promote the tone of the\r\ndigestive organs, and improve the functions of the system generally may\r\nbe considered advantageous in this neuralgic affection.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERITONITIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _peritoneum_, or serous membrane which lines the abdominal cavity\r\nand invests the intestines, is liable to become inflamed. When this\r\noccurs, the affection is termed peritonitis, and may be divided into the\r\n_acute_ and _chronic_ forms.\r\n\r\nACUTE PERITONITIS. This form may be circumscribed; that is, confined to\r\none spot, or it may extend over the entire surface of the peritoneum,\r\nwhen it is known as _general_.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS. There is headache, quick pulse, tongue coated white,\r\ncountenance pallid, features pinched, respiration difficult, nausea and\r\nvomiting, severe pain in the abdomen, which is extremely sensitive to\r\npressure and becomes very much distended. There is also pain in the\r\nlimbs, the bowels are constipated, and, in exceptional cases, diarrhea\r\nis a prominent symptom. The urine is deficient in quantity, and there is\r\nsleeplessness, chilliness, and great general prostration. Vomiting and\r\ncoughing or sneezing increase the pain. An erect position occasions\r\nintense suffering. The patient is compelled to assume a recumbent\r\nposture and is inclined to lie on the back, for in that position the\r\nsufferer experiences the least pressure of the vital organs against the\r\nperitoneum. There is also an inclination to draw up the lower limbs and\r\nretain them in a flexed position.\r\n\r\nCAUSES. Prominent among these are injuries which have been inflicted\r\nupon the intestines, compression of the colon, or rectum, perforation of\r\nthe stomach or bowels, either by violence or some pre-existing disease,\r\nthus allowing the discharge of blood, urine, bile, or fecal matter into\r\nthe abdominal cavity; also abortion, over-exertion, and exposure to wet\r\nor cold. As acute peritonitis is always a grave disease, involving more\r\nor less danger to life, it is the wisest course to employ a physician\r\nand trust the case to his management. The same remark is equally\r\napplicable to the chronic form of the disease.\r\n\r\nCHRONIC PERITONITIS. Like the acute, it may be either _circumscribed_ or\r\n_general_. This form is sometimes, though rarely, a sequel of the acute.\r\nWhen it appears independently of the acute, it is generally associated\r\nwith some cutaneous affection pertaining to the abdominal cavity, and\r\nthe inflammation is induced by the tumor. If chronic peritonitis be\r\nconnected with the _tubercular_ diathesis, tubercles may be discovered\r\nupon the surface of the stomach and alimentary canal, and may also be\r\nfound in the lungs and brain.\r\n\r\nWhen the affection is not tubercular there will appear in the abdominal\r\ncavity an effusion of serous fluid of greater or less quantity, mingled\r\nwith blood and pus. When such an effusion takes place, the abdomen\r\ngradually increases in size, or becomes smaller than is natural. There\r\nis pain, attended by soreness upon pressure, and the patient becomes\r\nemaciated.\r\n\r\nInflammation of the peritoneum is frequently an accompaniment of\r\n_puerperal fever_, which is a disease peculiar to childbirth, and which\r\nmay arise from cold, or be communicated from one parturient patient to\r\nanother by midwives.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. In the remedial management of acute peritonitis, it is\r\nobviously necessary to use some agent which will at once influence and\r\nchange the congested state and inflammatory condition. One of the best\r\nagents employed to make a decided impression upon the vascular system,\r\nsubdue inflammation, and modify its action, is the fluid extract of\r\nveratrum viride, administered in full doses, and repeated until the\r\nsystem shows its effects in a decided manner. Warm fomentations applied\r\nto the abdomen are sometimes very serviceable, and are objectionable\r\nonly because of their liability to dampen the bed-clothes. When the\r\nabdomen will bear a thick, warm poultice, apply it, and then cover the\r\nentire surface with oiled silk. The tincture of opium, in doses\r\nsufficient to relieve pain and quiet the peristaltic action of the\r\nintestines, is generally necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nEPIDEMIC CHOLERA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is an epidemic disease, supposed to be due to an impalpable\r\nspecific poison, but as to the exact nature of this poisonous matter\r\nnothing definite is known.\r\n\r\nThis plague first made its appearance on our continent in 1834. Owing to\r\nits great fatality, it is a disease much to be dreaded.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS. These are well defined. It is characterized in its earlier\r\nstages by pain in the stomach and bowels, especially in the umbilical\r\nregion, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea; later, the purging is excessive, and\r\nthe matter dejected resembles rice-water, and contains white, solid,\r\ncurd-like matter. The patient loses strength, and sinks rapidly. The\r\nsecretory organs fail to perform their functions normally, the skin is\r\nsometimes moist, but oftener cold and dry; but little if any bile is\r\nfound in the excretions, and the urine voided is very scanty. There is\r\ngeneral nervous derangement, as indicated by the spasmodic contraction\r\nor cramping of the muscles. This first attacks the extremities, but soon\r\naffects the entire body, and gives rise to excruciating pains. The head\r\nis affected by singing, roaring, disagreeable noises in the ears, the\r\npulse is feeble, but quick, the nails are of a bluish color, the tongue\r\nis coated white, the eyes are sunken, and the patient has a corpse-like\r\nappearance; the temperature of the body rapidly falls, the surface\r\nbecomes deathly cold, and, unless the disease is promptly arrested in\r\nits course, speedy dissolution follows. The disease is rarely prolonged\r\nbeyond twenty-four hours, and sometimes terminates within three or four\r\nhours after its first attack.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. The kind of medicine required depends upon the severity of\r\nthe attack and stage of the disease. In all cholera epidemics, there are\r\npremonitory symptoms, such, as an uneasy sensation at the pit of the\r\nstomach, and a rumbling of the bowels. This is apt to be followed by a\r\npainless diarrhea, which occasions no alarm, and the patient pays but\r\nlittle attention to it. Herein is the great and dangerous mistake. The\r\npatient is already in the stage of _invasion_, which must be promptly\r\narrested, or he will suddenly be precipitated into the stage of\r\n_collapse_. The patient should lie down, and have placed about him\r\nbottles filled with hot water, thereby exciting warmth upon the surface\r\nof the body. At the same time, administer two teaspoonfuls of the\r\nExtract of Smart-weed. If the symptoms are urgent, repeat the dose every\r\nfifteen minutes. Brandy, thickened with sugar, may also be given. In\r\neither the stage of _invasion_ or _collapse_, the leading indication is\r\nto establish _reaction_ by promoting perspiration. Bathe the feet in\r\nwater as hot as can be borne, give the Extract of Swart-weed freely, and\r\nthus endeavor to excite profuse diaphoresis. No time should be lost, for\r\ndelays are dangerous. When the reaction is established, the patient\r\nshould remain quiet, and not attempt to exert himself.\r\n\r\nAfter reaction has taken place, the sweating should be maintained for\r\ntwelve hours, and the patient should drink slippery-elm tea and\r\ntoast-water, and partake sparingly of soft toasted bread and chicken\r\nbroth. The food should be fluid and nutritious, but taken in small\r\nquantities. Do not disturb the bowels with laxatives until the third day\r\nafter the patient begins to improve, and then they may be moved by an\r\ninjection of warm water. Great care should be taken that the patient\r\ndoes not indulge too soon or too freely in the use of food. When a\r\nskillful physician can be had, no time should be lost in securing his\r\nservices, but since in epidemics of this nature, medical men are\r\ngenerally overworked, and not always easily and promptly to be had, we\r\nhave been quite explicit in giving full directions for treatment.\r\n\r\nCHOLERA MORBUS, also known as _sporadic cholera_ and _simple cholera_,\r\nusually occurs during the summer months. The attack may be sudden,\r\nalthough it is usually preceded by a sensation of uneasiness and colicky\r\npains in the stomach.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS. Nausea, vomiting and purging are the most prominent symptoms.\r\nThe discharge from the bowels is at first of a thin, yellow appearance,\r\nbut finally it becomes almost colorless. Sometimes, after the contents\r\nproper of the bowels have been evacuated, the dejections have a bilious\r\nappearance. Severe cramps and pain accompany the vomiting. The vomiting\r\nand purging usually occur in paroxysms, but finally become less\r\nfrequent, a reaction takes place, the extremities grow warm, and the\r\npatient gradually recovers. It may be accompanied by intense thirst and\r\na quick pulse, yet the surface may be cool.\r\n\r\nCAUSES. Cholera morbus is most prevalent in warm climates, and\r\nespecially in malarial districts. It is generally the result of eating\r\nindigestible articles of food, such as unripe fruit or uncooked\r\nvegetables. Stimulating drinks, or those articles which furnish the\r\nelements for fermentation, also favor the production of this disease.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. If the attack be superinduced by eating unripe or stale\r\nfruit, it may be proper to give an emetic or a cathartic, but ordinarily\r\nfirst give a full dose of the Extract of Smart-weed, and, if the vomited\r\nmatter is very sour, give the patient a weak, alkaline drink, which may\r\nbe made by dropping a few live, hard-wood coals into a tumbler of water.\r\nThis will not only assist in neutralizing the acidity of the stomach,\r\nbut will help to allay the thirst and accompanying fever. If the patient\r\nthrow up the first dose of the Extract of Smart-weed, a second should be\r\ngiven. Do not allow the patient to drink cold water, and give only\r\ntablespoonful doses of the alkaline solution every thirty minutes. If\r\nthe thirst is great, occasionally give a tablespoonful of a tea made\r\nfrom scorched Indian meal, which not only allays the desire to drink,\r\nbut also the irritation of the stomach. If to be obtained, give a tea of\r\nthe leaves or bark of the peach tree. The patient should be well covered\r\nin bed and kept warm. Laudanum by the stomach, or by enema, may he\r\nnecessary in severe cases to relieve the pain and check the purging. Hot\r\nfomentations applied to the bowels are very valuable. A mustard plaster\r\napplied over the abdomen will assist materially in relieving the nausea\r\nand vomiting. It should not be left on sufficiently long to blister.\r\nWhen the affection is promptly treated as we have suggested, the patient\r\ngenerally quickly recovers. If, however, it does not yield to these\r\nmeasures, the family physician should be called in.\r\n\r\n\r\nACCIDENTS AND EMERGENCIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccidents and emergencies which require immediate attention frequently\r\noccur. Professional aid cannot always be quickly obtained and hence\r\nfatal results often follow. It is, therefore, important that all persons\r\nshould not only know how to proceed under such circumstances, but that\r\nthey should be able to exercise that deliberation and self-control so\r\nnecessary in emergencies of all kinds. Most persons are more or less\r\naffected by the sight of blood or severe wounds, and it requires an\r\neffort to maintain self-possession. One should act resolutely; otherwise\r\nhe will find himself overcome and unable to render any assistance.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOUNDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWounds may be classified as _incised, punctured, contused, lacerated_,\r\nor _poisoned_.\r\n\r\n_Incised_ wounds are those which are made with a sharp, cutting\r\ninstrument, and are characterized by their extent of surface.\r\n\r\n_Punctured_ wounds are made with a pointed instrument, and distinguished\r\nfor their depth rather than breadth.\r\n\r\n_Contused_ wounds are those produced by bruises.\r\n\r\n_Lacerated_ wounds are those in which the flesh is torn and mangled.\r\n\r\n_Poisoned_ wounds are made with a poisoned instrument, or by some\r\npoisonous reptile or insect or rabid animal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.\r\nThe field Tourniquet as applied. ]\r\n\r\nIn all cases of wounds, the immediate danger is in the _shock_ produced\r\nupon the nervous system, and in the liability to _hemorrhage_.\r\n\r\nSHOCK. If severe, the shock is attended with symptoms of extreme\r\nprostration, such as a feeble pulse, shivering, partial unconsciousness,\r\nfainting, hiccough, vomiting, and involuntary discharges of the urine\r\nand feces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.\r\nMode of employing flexion for the\r\narrest of hemorrhage from a wound\r\nlocated below the elbow. ]\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF SHOCK. The clothing should be loosened immediately after\r\nthe accident, so that the blood may have free circulation, and the\r\npatient should be kept in a recumbent position. He should have plenty of\r\nfresh air. Camphor or ammonia may be inhaled. If he can swallow,\r\nstimulants may be given, as whiskey or brandy, but with care that they\r\ndo not run into the trachea, or windpipe. If he be unable to swallow,\r\nthey may be administered as injections, but should gradually be\r\ndiscontinued as reaction takes place. A warm pillow placed at the back\r\nand the use of electricity may be beneficial.\r\n\r\nHEMORRHAGE, or bleeding, may generally be controlled by a _compress,\r\ntourniquet, flexion of the joint_, or _styptics._ A _compress_ consists\r\nof several folds of cloth laid upon a wound, the edges of which have\r\nbeen brought together, and made secure by a moderately tight bandage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.\r\nMode of employing flexion for the arrest of hemorrhage from a wound\r\nbelow the knee.]\r\n\r\n_A tourniquet_ may be extemporized by rolling a handkerchief into a cord\r\nand tying it around the limb, over a compress, between the wound and the\r\nheart. A stick should then be thrust between the handkerchief and skin\r\nand twisted around several times, until the pressure is sufficiently\r\ngreat to arrest the circulation of the blood in the wounded part. A\r\nrepresentation of this operation may be seen in Fig. 1.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\nMode of employing flexion for the arrest of hemorrhage from a wound\r\nlocated between the thigh and knee.]\r\n\r\n_Flexion of the joint_, as represented in Figs. 2, 3, and 4, is adapted\r\nto many cases of hemorrhage. As water cannot flow through a rubber tube\r\nbent at a sharp angle, so the acute flexion of a limb prevents the free\r\nflow of blood through the arterial tubes.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, _styptics_ may be directly applied to the wounded\r\ntissues. Cold acts as a powerful styptic, and may generally be made\r\navailable for arresting hemorrhage.\r\n\r\nPOISONED WOUNDS. The treatment of these should chiefly consist in the\r\nprevention of the spread of the poison. This may be done by tightly\r\napplying bandages above the wound and scarifying or sucking the parts.\r\nNitrate of silver may then be used and the ligatures removed. Alcohol,\r\nin any form, is an antidote to snake poison. For the stings of insects,\r\napply aqua ammonia, fresh earth, raw onion, plantain, or spirits of\r\nturpentine.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRACTURES AND DISLOCATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe treatment of injuries received from the fracture of bones and the\r\ndislocation of joints should never be attempted by the inexperienced,\r\nnor should the management be left to incompetent physicians but\r\n_skillful_ surgical aid should at once be summoned.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRAINS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA sprain consists of a sudden and forcible stretching of the ligaments\r\nand tendons connected with a joint, without there being any dislocation.\r\nIt is attended with severe pain and is followed by rapid swelling.\r\n\r\nThe treatment should consist of measures to prevent inflammation,\r\npromote absorption, and restore a healthy action. The affected part\r\nshould be kept at rest in an elevated position, and hot or cold water\r\napplied frequently. If there is much inflammation, fomentations of hops\r\nmay be used. The Compound Extract of Smart-weed is an excellent\r\napplication.\r\n\r\nWhen the acute symptoms have disappeared, absorption should be favored\r\nby systematic rubbing and the application of stimulating liniments, or\r\nby the use of a well-adjusted bandage. Passive motion may be resorted to\r\ngradually and the subject may use the joint moderately. Should any\r\nstiffness remain, warm salt water douches should be employed and the\r\nExtract of Smart-weed applied once a day.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRUISES.\r\n\r\n\r\nBruises or contusions are caused by falls, wrenches, or blows from blunt\r\ninstruments, without breaking the skin. The soft tissues are lacerated\r\nand blood is poured out into them, constituting _ecchymosis_. The\r\ndiscoloration passes through various shades from a bluish-black to a\r\nviolet, a green, and finally, a yellow.\r\n\r\nIf the bruise is severe, the affected part should be kept at rest and\r\nfrequently bathed with the Compound Extract of Smart-weed or the\r\ntincture of arnica. If inflammatory symptoms supervene, fomentations and\r\npoultices should be applied.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREIGN BODIES IN THE NOSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nForeign bodies, such as beads, peas, coffee-grains, and small\r\ngravel-stones are occasionally introduced into the nostrils of children,\r\nbecoming fastened there, and causing great anxiety and alarm. If allowed\r\nto remain, they generally cause inflammation and suffering.\r\n\r\nSuch bodies may generally be washed out by gently injecting a stream of\r\ntepid salt water with a syringe or Dr. Pierce's Nasal Douche. In no case\r\nshould force be used. If these means fail, a competent surgeon should be\r\nconsulted.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREIGN BODIES IN THE THROAT AND AIR-PASSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nForeign bodies are generally arrested so high up that they may be seen\r\nby simply depressing the tongue, and removed with the finger or a pair\r\nof forceps. The head should be thrown back in such a position as to\r\ncause the chin to project as little as possible beyond the prominence\r\nknown as Adam's apple, in order that the finger or forceps may be\r\nreadily introduced and the body released and ejected. When the foreign\r\nbodies are so small as to pass out of sight in the larynx, windpipe, or\r\nesophagus, it is generally difficult to extract them, and the services\r\nof a surgeon are required. Fortunately, however, there is not much\r\nimmediate danger from suffocation in such cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nDROWNING.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecovery from drowning sometimes occurs when life is apparently extinct.\r\nThe treatment, however, should be immediate and energetic, and should be\r\ngiven in the open air, unless the weather be too cold.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. The patient should be gently placed upon the face with his\r\nwrists under his forehead. The tongue will then fall forward and the\r\nwater run out of his mouth and throat, while the windpipe, or\r\nair-passage, will be free. To restore respiration, he should be\r\ninstantly turned upon his right side, his nostrils excited with snuff or\r\nammonia, and cold water dashed upon his face and chest. If this\r\noperation prove unsuccessful, replace the patient upon his face, care\r\nbeing taken to raise and support his chest, turn the body gently on the\r\nside and quickly again upon the face. Alternate these movements about\r\nevery four seconds, and occasionally change sides. When the body is\r\nturned on the face, gentle but efficient pressure should be made along\r\nthe back, between the shoulder blades, to assist in forcing the air out\r\nof the lungs, but this pressure ought to be removed before the patient\r\nis turned back on his side. Persistently repeat this operation, and\r\nsuccess will often be the reward. As soon as respiration is established,\r\nwarmth may be promoted by the application of warm flannels to the body\r\nand bottles of hot water to the stomach, armpits, thighs, and feet.\r\nDuring the entire process of restoration, the body should be thoroughly\r\nrubbed _upwards_. Turning the body upon the back or handling it roughly\r\nshould be avoided. The person should not be held up by his feet, or be\r\nrubbed with salt or spirits. Rolling the body on a cask is improper, and\r\ninjections of the smoke infusion of tobacco are injurious. Avoid the\r\nconstant application of the warm bath, and do not allow a crowd to\r\nsurround the body.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAINTING.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a person faints, _he should be allowed to remain or be placed in a\r\nrecumbent posture_, and his clothing immediately loosened. The\r\nextremities should be rubbed, the patient permitted to have plenty of\r\nfresh air, and, if at hand, ammonia or camphor should be applied to the\r\nnostrils.\r\n\r\n\r\nBURNS AND SCALDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe danger arising from burns and scalds depends not only upon the\r\nextent of surface involved, but also upon the depth of the injury. Burns\r\nare most dangerous when occurring upon the head, chest, or abdomen.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. Soothing applications, and those which will exclude the air,\r\nshould be made. Grated potato, poultices of slippery-elm, sweet oil,\r\ncotton saturated in a mixture composed of two or three grains of\r\ncarbolic acid and two ounces of glycerine, and linseed oil and white\r\nlead, are all beneficial for the treatment of burns. If internal\r\ntreatment be necessary, it should be given under the direction of a\r\ncompetent physician.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUN-STROKE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn cases of sun-stroke, the patient should be at once removed into the\r\nshade. If the face is _flushed_, apply cold water to the head and neck,\r\nand mustard to the feet. The body should be bathed in tepid water and\r\nthe head slightly elevated. If the countenance is pale, the symptoms\r\ndenote exhaustion, and the patient should be kept in a recumbent\r\nposition, the extremities rubbed, camphor and ammonia inhaled, mustard\r\napplied to the spine, and stimulants, such as brandy or whiskey, should\r\nbe administered.\r\n\r\n\r\n            POISONS AND THEIR ANTIDOTES.\r\n    ----------------------+--------------------------------------------------\r\n    POISONS.              | ANTIDOTES.\r\n    ----------------------+--------------------------------------------------\r\n    ACIDS.                |\r\n                          |\r\n    Acetic Acid.          | Alkalies--carbonate of soda and potash--also\r\n    Citric Acid.          | lime and magnesia are antidotes to these\r\n    Muriatic Acid.        | poisons.

Children of a scrofulous diathesis are especially\r\nliable to this affection. It is generally due to disease of the\r\ninter-vertebral cartilages and bodies of the vertebræ. It comes on in a\r\nslow, insidious manner, hence, it often makes serious inroads upon the\r\nspine and system before its character is even suspected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.\r\n\r\nThe above portion of the spinal column shows the manner of the breaking\r\ndown of the vertebræ from caries,\r\nand the absorption of their bony\r\nstructure.]\r\n\r\nGenerally the first point of invasion is the cartilaginous substances\r\nbetween the bodies of the vertebræ, beginning with inflammation, and\r\nfinally resulting in ulceration and a breaking-down of the cartilages.\r\nIt next invades the vertebræ themselves, and producing caries, or death\r\nand decay of the bony substance, which softens and wastes away, as shown\r\nin Fig. 1. The vertebræ become softened and broken down, and weight of\r\nthe body pressing them together produces the deformity known as\r\n\"humpback.\" (See Fig. 2 and Fig. 3.)\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS. Among the various symptoms present in the earlier stages of\r\nthe disease, and during its progress, we deem it necessary to mention\r\nonly a few of the more prominent ones. While the patient is yet able to\r\ngo around, the disease manifests itself by occasional pain in the\r\nbowels, stomach, and chest. Often there is a hacking cough, nervousness,\r\nlassitude, and a generally enfeebled condition of the whole system. The\r\npatient is easily fatigued; there is apparent loss of vitality, impaired\r\nappetite, a feeling of tightness across the stomach and chest, gradually\r\ndeclining health, and loss of flesh and strength, torpidity of the\r\nliver, deficient secretions, constipation, and morbid excretions from\r\nthe kidneys. The victim, in passing chairs, tables, and other objects,\r\ninstinctively places his hands upon them, and, as the disease\r\nprogresses, when standing, leans upon some support whenever possible. In\r\nwalking, he moves very carefully and cautiously, with elbows thrown back\r\nand chest forward, to assist the body in keeping its equilibrium. The\r\nbody being kept in an upright position, the patient bends the knees\r\nrather than the back in stooping, as illustrated in Fig. 5, and the body\r\nis frequently supported by the hands being placed upon the thighs or\r\nknees. Sudden movements or shocks cause more or less pain.\r\n\r\nThe development of the disease then becomes rapid; suffering increases,\r\nand pain about the joints and lower extremities and muscles of the\r\nposterior part of the pelvis is experienced; numbness and coldness of\r\nthe extremities are felt; locomotion becomes more difficult, and a\r\nslight projection is observed upon the back. Even in this somewhat\r\nadvanced stage of the disease, when the symptoms are so apparent, many\r\ncases are shamefully neglected because an ignorant adviser says it is\r\nnothing serious and that the patient will outgrow it. The pain and\r\ntenderness not always being in the back, the inexperienced are very\r\noften misled as to the true character of the trouble. This distortion or\r\ndeformity of the back now becomes painfully prominent; the diseased\r\nvertebræ quickly soften and waste away; the pressure upon the spinal\r\ncord increases, and paralysis of the limbs supervenes; the power of\r\nlocomotion is lost, and, at last, the danger is realized and the\r\nstruggle for life begins.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.]\r\n\r\nThus, through ignorance, neglect, and improper treatment, the poor,\r\nhelpless victim is doomed to a life of hideous deformity and suffering.\r\nWe would, therefore, urge upon parents whose children are afflicted with\r\nthis terrible disease, the great importance of placing them under the\r\ncare of surgeons who have for many years made the treatment of such\r\ncases a specialty, and who have every facility and all necessary\r\nsurgical appliances for insuring success in every case undertaken.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.\r\nAppearance of a child suffering from\r\nPott's disease of the spine.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.\r\nMode of stooping adopted by a child\r\nsuffering from spinal disease.]\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. The great essentials for the successful treatment of disease\r\nand deformities of the spine are first, a thorough knowledge of the\r\nstructure and parts involved by the disease; secondly, the adjustment of\r\nmechanical appliances perfectly adapted to the requirements and\r\nnecessities of each individual case, and the proper use of our system of\r\n\"vitalization,\" applied to the spinal muscles to strengthen the weaker\r\nand relieve the undue contraction of the stronger. For many years our\r\nspecialists have experimented, and have given the various appliances in\r\ncommon use in these cases most thorough and practical tests, and have\r\nfound them very defective, being generally constructed upon wrong\r\nprinciples. The physician who sends to a mechanic for an appliance, such\r\nas are now made in the shops of most instrument makers, and uses the\r\nsame, is doing himself an injustice, and barbarously torturing his\r\npatient by forcing him to wear an apparatus which is heavy, clumsy, and\r\ninevitably injurious, instead of being beneficial in its results. In the\r\ntreatment of diseases and deformities of the spine, there should be no\r\ncompromising; the appliance that fails to give complete support should\r\nnot be worn. In our treatment of these maladies we employ only\r\nappliances which are constructed under the personal supervision of our\r\nspecialists, upon principles dictated by common sense and the actual\r\nnecessities of the case. We do not confine the body in an iron jacket.\r\nOur apparatus is light, yet durable, and is worn by the most delicate\r\nchildren without pain or inconvenience. It gives proper support to all\r\nparts, and is so nicely adjusted as to produce pressure only upon those\r\npoints which should receive support, leaving the muscles of the spine\r\nfreedom of action, thereby assisting in their development. In many\r\nhundreds of cases treated by our specialists, the disease has been\r\nentirely cured and the deformity removed. After seeing the patients and\r\nadjusting the appliances, they can generally be treated at their homes.\r\n\r\n\r\nLATERAL CURVATURE OF THE SPINE.\r\n\r\n(CROOKED BACK.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.\r\nLateral curvature of the spine. E to F, the primary curve.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.\r\nA mild case of lateral curvature of the spine.]\r\n\r\nThis deformity appears more frequently in anæmic persons, in whom the\r\nflexibility and elasticity of the muscles are weakened, than in those of\r\na plethoric habit. It is generally contracted during youth, between the\r\nages of twelve and eighteen. Persons of sedentary and indolent habits\r\nare especially liable to this deformity, hence, girls are most\r\nfrequently its victims. It is never seen among the natives of tropical\r\ncountries who habitually live in the open air, and seldom among the\r\nbarbarous races of northern latitudes. A distinguishing feature of the\r\nAmerican Indian is his erect carriage. The _primary_ curvature is\r\ngenerally toward the right side, as represented in Figs. 6 and 7. Figs.\r\n8 and 9 show the disease in a more advanced stage. The ribs are thus\r\nforced into an unnatural position, and the vital organs contained in the\r\ncavity of the chest are compressed or displaced, thus distorting the\r\nform of the whole upper portion of the body.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.\r\nLateral curvature in an\r\nadvanced stage. ]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.\r\nLateral curvature in an\r\nadvanced stage. ]\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS. The first indication of lateral curvature of the spine is a\r\nmarked projection of the right scapula, or shoulder-blade. It is\r\nsometimes first observed by the dressmaker, or, accidentally, while\r\nbathing. The right shoulder is slightly elevated, while the left hip is\r\ndepressed and projects upward. If not corrected while in its earlier\r\nstages, it progresses very rapidly, and a second curvature is developed.\r\nThe symptoms vary in different cases, and in the early stages are\r\nsomewhat obscure and undefined, but generally the patient feels a sense\r\nof uneasiness, languor, stupor, and nervousness, loss of energy and\r\nambition, general debility, poor appetite, gradually declining health,\r\nloss of strength and flesh, and, as the disease progresses, a slight\r\nelevation of one of the shoulder-blades is noticed, as well as the\r\ndeviation of the spine to one side. The curve, or distortion, of the\r\nspine increases more rapidly as the body becomes heavier, the spine\r\noften assuming the shape of the letter S, and, from compression by\r\ntorsion of the vertebræ and distortion of the ribs, the vital organs are\r\nencroached upon, causing serious functional derangement of the heart,\r\nlungs, liver, and stomach, producing, as its inevitable consequence a\r\nlist of maladies fearful to contemplate.\r\n\r\nCAUSES. In rare instances, the lateral curvature of the spine is due to\r\ndefects of certain bones of the pelvis or limbs. Cases are recorded in\r\nwhich this deformity was caused by diseases of the abdominal organs,\r\nbut, as we have intimated, it is generally due to a lack of tonicity of\r\nthe muscles, or, as a late writer has expressed it, \"Want of\r\ncorrespondence in the antagonism of those muscles which control the\r\nmotions of the spinal column.\" Habitual sitting or standing in a leaning\r\nposture, or standing upon one foot, thus constantly using one set of the\r\nmuscles of the back, while the other becomes enfeebled by the lack of\r\nexercise, is a common cause of this deformity. The habit which so many\r\nschool-girls contract of drawing up one foot under the body while\r\nsitting, often produces a lateral curvature of the spine.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT. No disease or deformity of the spine is so easily cured and\r\nperfectly corrected, if the proper plan of treatment is pursued. To\r\ncorrect this deformity, many ingenious forms of apparatus have been\r\ndevised and invented by our specialists, which should be carefully\r\nadjusted to each individual case. In addition to this, our method of\r\ntreatment by \"vitalization,\" and by mechanical movements and\r\nmanipulations, is almost indispensable in these cases. It never fails to\r\ngive relief, and, if properly pursued, invariably results in a permanent\r\ncure.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFORMED FEET, HANDS AND LIMBS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are thousands whose feet, hands, and limbs are almost entirely\r\nuseless, besides having an unsightly appearance. Their condition has\r\nbeen helpless so long, their treatment so varied, and their hopes of\r\nrelief or cure have been so often disappointed, that few can believe the\r\ntruth of our statement, when we positively assert that we can correct\r\nand cure nearly all cases of talipes, club, or crooked feet and deformed\r\nhands, and make them as perfect in appearance, and as useful in action,\r\nas feet and hands which have never been deformed. While this may seem\r\nmiraculous, or even impossible, to those who are unacquainted with the\r\nwonderful improvements and rapid progress made in this department of\r\nsurgical science, it is attested and verified by living witnesses whose\r\nfeet and hands were once deformed and useless, but which have been made\r\nperfect by our new and improved method of treatment. We do not make\r\nthese statements in a spirit of vain boastfulness, but having devoted\r\nmany years to improving and perfecting surgical appliances and\r\napparatus, and having had practical experience in the successful\r\ntreatment of thousands of cases, we do say that our manner of treatment\r\nis original and employed only by us. We entirely ignore the ineffectual\r\nmethods usually employed in such cases. Our treatment causes no pain,\r\nand little inconvenience, yet the curative results are speedy and\r\ncertain, and a hundredfold more satisfactory than those obtained by any\r\nother course.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.\r\nTalipes Equinus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.\r\nTalipes Calcaneus.]\r\n\r\nWe have most thoroughly tested all the best forms of treatment\r\nheretofore devised and employed in this class of diseases, and have\r\nadopted the best features of all the various methods heretofore pursued.\r\nWe have combined these with our own improvements and, as the result, we\r\nhave perfected a thorough and efficient system of treatment, based upon\r\nscientific principles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.\r\nTalipes Valgus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.\r\nDouble Club-foot.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.\r\nBow-legs.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.\r\nKnock-knees.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.\r\nThe above illustrations represent various Deformities cured by our\r\nSpecialists\r\nat the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMECHANICAL AIDS\r\n\r\nIN THE TREATMENTS OF\r\n\r\nCHRONIC DISEASES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have, in different parts of this work, referred to a large variety of\r\ningeniously devised machinery and apparatus employed at the Invalids'\r\nHotel and Surgical Institute, in the treatment of chronic diseases.\r\nAlthough we can, on paper, give but a meagre idea of the variety and\r\nadaptability of these valuable mechanical appliances, yet we will\r\nendeavor to illustrate and explain a few of our machines for the\r\napplication of transmitted motion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.\r\nThe Manipulator. ]\r\n\r\nFig. 1 represents a machine, called the Manipulator, which transmits\r\nmotion through suitable attachments, which are adjustable by means of\r\nthe ratchet _G_, so as to reach all parts of the body. It is equally\r\navailable for applying motion to the head, feet, or any intermediate\r\npart of the body.\r\n\r\n _B, B_ are rubbing attachments, with two opposing elastic, adherent\r\nsurfaces, between which an arm or a leg may be included. These have\r\nalternate reciprocating action from the rock-shaft _H_, and are made to\r\napproach each other, and press the included part at the will of the\r\npatient. This is sometimes called the double-rubber, and is made\r\ndetachable if desired.\r\n\r\n_A_ is the lever, by which the two parts of the double-rubber are made\r\nto compress the arm or leg.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.\r\nManipulator Extended.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.\r\nManipulator Folded.]\r\n\r\n_D_ is a single attachment for rubbing. It may be connected at either\r\nside of the machine, so as to present the rubbing surface in four\r\ndifferent directions, as may be most convenient. It will act\r\nperpendicularly, horizontally, or diagonally, and from below or from\r\nabove the part receiving the action, according to requirements. The\r\nshank of the rubber may have any special form to suit special cases.\r\n\r\n_C_ is the _foot holder._ It communicates to the leg the semi-rotary or\r\noscillating motion of the rock-shaft. It may be attached to either end\r\nof the rock-shaft.\r\n\r\n_E_ is the _hand holder,_ which, grasped by the hand, communicates\r\nmotion to the arm, shoulder, and chest; or the hand may be inserted\r\npassively, when the effect of motion is more confined to the hand and\r\nfore-arm.\r\n\r\nIn the position shown in Fig. 2, by means of the single rubber\r\nattachment, the manipulator acts upon the upper portion of the trunk,\r\nneck, head, and arms; by means of the hand-holder, upon the arms; by\r\nmeans of the double-rubber, upon the arms, shoulders, and scalp.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.\r\nRubbing the Arms.]\r\n\r\nWhen the acting part or head is lowered to its extreme limit, the\r\nmachine occupies the least space. In this position, by means of the\r\nfoot-holder it communicates oscillation to the legs; by means of the\r\nsingle-rubber, it acts upon the feet, ankles, and lower leg; by means of\r\nthe double-rubber, it acts upon the legs, including the feet, the\r\npatient either sitting or lying.\r\n\r\nIn all of these applications of motion, energy travels from inanimate to\r\nanimate matter; non-vital contributes to vital energy: and the various\r\nprocesses through which vital power is developed are promoted and\r\ncarried forward in a degree till the point which constitutes health is\r\nattained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.\r\nRubbing the Legs.]\r\n\r\nThe name, _Manipulator_, is very naturally applied to the instrument,\r\nthe action of which resembles so much that of the living operator. It\r\nis, however, impossible for the unaided hand to impart the degree of\r\nrapidity necessary to secure the effects easily attained by this\r\nmachine; and, practically, restoration is often secured in cases in\r\nwhich it is quite unattainable by any other remedial agent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.\r\nRubbing the Chest and Abdomen.]\r\n\r\nMotion, transmitted by the manipulator, exerts a curative effect in\r\n_all_ chronic affections, and is not limited, as is sometimes supposed,\r\nto paralytic affections and deformities. In these latter affections it\r\nis a great assistance in effecting a cure; while, in chronic affections,\r\nwhatever the local symptoms, it supplies the additional energy which is\r\nindispensable for recovery in all diseases of long standing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.\r\nRubbing the Back.]\r\n\r\n_Mode of Operation_.--Fig. 4 represents the manipulator in operation.\r\nThe machine is propelled by steam power at the Invalids' Hotel and\r\nSurgical Institute, but may be worked by hand, as here represented. One\r\narm is inserted between the double-rubbing pads, which are raised to\r\nabout the height of the shoulders, the patient being seated at the side\r\nof the machine; the other hand is placed on the lever, and as much\r\npressure is applied as is perfectly agreeable, care being taken to\r\ndiminish the pressure at any part which is unusually sensitive. All\r\nportions of the arm from the shoulder down are successively included in\r\nthe rubbers, while a suitable degree of reciprocating or rubbing action\r\nis obtained by giving motion to the wheel.\r\n\r\nTo apply the same operation to the other arm, the patient may either\r\nturn in his seat or change his position to the opposite side of the\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\nIf any portion of the extremity is affected with inflammation or\r\nswelling, it is necessary to apply the action described to the whole of\r\nthe unaffected portion first; after this the affected part may be\r\nbeneficially operated on, provided that the sensations are strictly\r\nheeded, and that it is so managed that only a comfortable feeling is\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.\r\nOscillating the Arms and Chest.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 5, the patient is so seated beside the machine that he can\r\ninsert one thigh between the pads of the rubber, and also control the\r\nlever with the hand. It is sometimes more convenient to suspend a\r\nmovable weight from the lever. While the machine is running, he can\r\nwithdraw the leg gradually, as each portion receives its proper amount\r\nof action, till the whole, including the foot, becomes glowing with the\r\neffect. The boot or shoe affords no impediment to the effect, and should\r\nremain on.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.\r\nOscillating the Legs.]\r\n\r\nSometimes, especially in the beginning, or when the feet are habitually\r\ncold, it is better to apply the action only from the knees down.\r\n\r\nThe rubbing-pad (d) may be attached to either side of the machine,\r\naccording to convenience or effect sought. The action derived from the\r\nright end of the rock-shaft is much less severe than that from the left,\r\non account of the shape of the rubber appendage, and at the beginning\r\nshould be used in preference. In Fig. 6, the patient sits on an ordinary\r\nstool, or, if feeble, in a chair, and presents any portion of the chest\r\nor abdomen to the action of the rubber. The instrument is raised or\r\nlowered to suit convenience, while the patient gently presses portions\r\nof the trunk successively upon the rubbing-pad. The degree of the effect\r\nis thus always under the absolute control of the one receiving the\r\naction. This operation, like the preceding, produces great heat, reddens\r\nthe skin, relieves pain, and greatly stimulates the functions, not only\r\nof the skin, but of the organs contained in the cavities of the chest\r\nand the abdomen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.\r\nVibrator operated by Manipulator.]\r\n\r\nThe same operation may be applied also to the legs while the patient is\r\nstanding.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 7, the back is presented to the action of the rubbing-pad. The\r\naction will, if desired, be made to reach from the neck to the hips, and\r\neven to the thighs. All sensitive portions of the back should at first\r\nbe omitted, in order that they may be benefited by the\r\ncounter-irritation or drawing away of the blood. This is easily produced\r\nby those familiar with the use of the machine. The rubbing of the back\r\nshould be deferred till the close of each application, in order that the\r\nspinal centers may be relieved of hyperaemia, or excess of blood.\r\n\r\nThe machine, as represented by Fig. 8, is brought to the desired\r\nelevation, about as high as the shoulders, and the hand-holder is\r\nattached. One arm is extended horizontally, and the hand grasps the\r\nhand-holder, while rapid motion is given by turning the wheel. An\r\nalternate twisting motion is communicated to the arm, which causes\r\ncorresponding pressure and relaxation of all the soft tissues of the\r\nlimb, combined with slight rubbing or attrition. The action is increased\r\nby contracting the muscles, and also by grasping at greater distance\r\nfrom the center. Both hands may grasp at the same time, or the two sides\r\nmay receive the motion in turn. The effect is similar to that of the\r\nrubbing before described, but it is less limited; by grasping firmly, it\r\nmay extend to the whole chest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.\r\nVibrating Kneader.]\r\n\r\nThe foot-holder is attached, as shown in Fig. 9, and brought by the\r\nmeans before described to a position to receive one foot at a\r\ncomfortable elevation, the leg being extended, while the patient is\r\nseated in an ordinary chair in an easy position. The action is precisely\r\nlike that above described as applied to the arm, and extends to the\r\nthigh and pelvis. If the knee is slightly flexed, the action is almost\r\nentirely confined to the lower leg. Each leg may be operated on in turn.\r\n\r\n_Mode of Applying Mechanical Movements to Very Feeble\r\nInvalids_.--Experience demonstrates that no degree of feebleness\r\nexcludes the beneficial use of these operations. Invalids too weak to\r\nstand, or able to help themselves in the least degree are often treated\r\nwith perfect success. A judicious use of the Manipulator _always_\r\nincreases nutrition and strength without any fatigue or exhaustion,\r\nhowever feeble the patient may be. It is only necessary to provide for\r\nthese cases additional conveniences, so that the applications can be\r\nmade in the recumbent position, and also that proper intervals of rest\r\nbe allowed between successive operations. For this purpose couches are\r\nprovided, each containing a certain portion of the Manipulator. These\r\nare operated by means of a short connecting-rod, joining the rock-shafts\r\nof the two pieces of mechanism, as shown in Fig. 10. The Vibrator has\r\ntwo small discs, or heads acting through an opening in the couch on\r\nwhich the invalid rests. These impinge with a rapid, direct stroke upon\r\nthe portion of the body exposed to the action. The top of the couch is\r\nadjustable, and is quickly placed at the elevation which secures the\r\nproper force of the instrument, as shown in Fig 11. By simply turning\r\nand moving the body, the patient brings any part in contact with the\r\nvibrating discs. The cut represents the Vibrator, in which the force\r\nimpinges at right angles with the surface of the body, sending waves of\r\nmotion through its substance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.\r\nApparatus for the Rubbing in a Recumbent Position.]\r\n\r\nThe rubbing which is shown in Figs. 4 and 5 may be applied to all parts\r\nof the body in a recumbent position. A couch is required of similar\r\nconstruction to the vibrating couch, but with a rubbing-pad instead of\r\nvibrating heads acting through the opening and operated by appropriate\r\nconnections, as shown in Fig. 12. The top is adjustable, and the degree\r\nof effect desired is capable of easy regulation. The patient turns\r\ndifferent portions of the body to the action of the rubber as required.\r\n\r\nKNEADING. Kneading is a process applied chiefly to the abdomen. The\r\npurpose of this operation is to increase nutrition, the muscular power\r\nand action of the abdominal walls, and the function of the organs which\r\nthey contain. Three modes of applying this operation by the mechanical\r\napparatus are in use, effected by the Direct, the Rotary, and the\r\nRevolving Kneader.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.\r\nApparatus for Rotary Kneading.]\r\n\r\nTHE DIRECT KNEADER. This resembles in form and action the vibrating\r\ninstrument shown in Fig. 11. The impinging heads, however, are made\r\nbroader, the motion greater in extent, and the rate of motion less than\r\none-tenth of that employed for the purpose of vibrating. This slowness\r\nof motion seems to increase the action of the muscles.\r\n\r\nTHE ROTARY KNEADER. The action of the kneading heads in this form of\r\napparatus, as shown in Fig. 13, is _inward_ and _upward_ alternately,\r\nand it is eminently well calculated to stimulate the action of the\r\nabdominal organs.\r\n\r\nTHE REVOLVING KNEADER. In the form of kneading apparatus, shown in Fig.\r\n14, two thick rollers, which move freely on axes at the extremities of\r\narms, projecting on either side of a shaft turned by a crank or belt,\r\nare made to act alternately upon each side of the abdomen.\r\n\r\nIn the methods of kneading above described, the degree of force acting\r\non the body is governed by an arrangement for elevating or depressing\r\nthe upholstered top of the couch upon which the patient rests, and\r\nthrough which the action is transmitted to the body.\r\n\r\nIf this form of apparatus is driven at a rate ten times more rapidly\r\nthan is desired for kneading, the effect is vibratory, and it is, in\r\nfact, used for that purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.\r\nApparatus for Kneading with Rollers.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CURE OF SWELLINGS AND TUMORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe application of motion through the Manipulator promotes absorption,\r\nand thus all kinds of _swellings_ and non-malignant _tumors_ are made to\r\ndiminish under its use. In these cases the vessels of the affected part\r\nare distended with stagnant blood, and a portion of the fluid passes\r\nthrough their walls, distending the surrounding tissues, which become\r\nmore or less hardened. By the transmission of active motion to the\r\naffected parts, the contents of the vessels are urged forward; the\r\noutside fluids are thus permitted to return to the general circulation\r\nand become subject to the energetic vital action of the general system,\r\nlocal deficiencies of oxidation being increased to the normal degree,\r\ncausing destruction of morbid matter and giving place for new and\r\nwholesome nutritive materials for vital use. In short, normal functional\r\nactivity is established, both locally and generally. Scrofulous,\r\ndropsical, rheumatic, and other local accumulations disappear, and even\r\ntumors are dispersed, by the use of the Manipulator, in cases in which\r\nthe knife would otherwise be required.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUNTER-IRRITATION AND REVULSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nArtificial means have always been employed to produce an energetic flow\r\nof blood in different parts of the body, thereby relieving morbid\r\ndistention of the vessels, and consequent irritation and pain in\r\nneighboring parts. Cupping, hot applications, mustard, capsicum,\r\nblisters, and other irritants, are resorted to, but their effects, while\r\ngenerally very good in acute cases, are too transient to be of material\r\naid in chronic affections. By the use of the Manipulator, we can produce\r\nthe most thorough revulsive effects, operating upon large surfaces, and\r\ncausing large masses of muscle to receive an increased amount of blood,\r\nthus drawing it away from parts oppressed by too great a supply,\r\nconstituting engorgement. No injury is done to the parts acted upon; on\r\nthe contrary, they are strengthened by the application, which can be\r\nrepeated as often as necessary till relief is permanent. Thus, the head,\r\nheart, digestive organs, liver, chest, or whatever part is oppressed by\r\nexcess of blood, may be speedily and permanently relieved. By means of\r\nthis ability to relieve any part of the system from engorgement, and\r\nconsequent inflammation and its results, are we enabled to permanently\r\ncure a large variety of chronic inflammatory, ulcerative, and nervous\r\naffections.\r\n\r\nLocal inflammations by this method of treatment may be speedily cured.\r\n\r\n\r\nCURE OF NEURALGIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the transmission of motion through the Manipulator and other\r\ningeniously devised apparatus and machinery, we increase the functional\r\npower and activity of the muscles, and thereby diminish morbid\r\nsensibility of the nerves, which is present in neuralgia. Prolonged and\r\nexcessive nervous action is attended with too great a rush of blood to\r\nthe nerve-centers, which can only be relieved by increasing the flow in\r\nthe muscles. Congestion, or hyperaemia, in the spinal cord or brain, or\r\nboth, is a condition ever present in neuralgia. The application of\r\nmotion through the manipulator causes the blood to flow to the muscles,\r\nthus relieving nervous congestion and consequent neuralgia.\r\n\r\n\r\nCURE OF PARALYSIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn no single disease has the transmission of motion through the\r\nManipulator proved more thoroughly efficacious than in _paralysis_. The\r\nmost prominent requirements in these cases seem to be the following:\r\n\r\nExcess of blood in the brain and spinal cord needs to be removed and\r\ndiverted to parts in which it will be useful instead of obstructive.\r\n\r\nThe contractile power of the capillaries should be improved.\r\n\r\nThe quality of nutritive fluids should be improved by the promotion of\r\noxidation through increased circulation.\r\n\r\nThese and many more wants of disordered nerves, are readily supplied by\r\ntransmitted motion.\r\n\r\nThe Manipulator combines, in a single ingenious mechanical contrivance,\r\nthe several movements best adapted for the promotion of healthy\r\nfunctional activity.\r\n\r\n\r\nCURE OF DEFORMITIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Deformities arising from _paralysis and contractions of muscles and\r\ntendons_, producing stiffened joints and distorted limbs, are of common\r\noccurrence. A rational explanation of the wonderful curative results\r\nwhich follow the employment of transmitted motion in these cases may not\r\nbe without interest to the reader. The muscles are composed of _bundles_\r\nof little fibers which glide upon one another in every movement. Another\r\nset of fibers called _connective tissue_, holds the fibers together in\r\nbundles or separate muscles, and interlaces and crosses them in every\r\ndirection. Now, if these fibers remain long in a fixed position, or are\r\ninvolved in inflammation, there is danger of adhesions forming between\r\nthem, producing permanent immobility; gliding movements are interfered\r\nwith, and the muscle ceases to perform its function. Inflammation gives\r\nrise to effusion, or the formation of a kind of cement which binds\r\ntogether the muscular fibers and prevents motion.\r\n\r\nRubbing, kneading, and actively manipulating the affected parts with\r\nthat intensity of administration secured by the manipulator, rends\r\nasunder and breaks up these minute adhesions, re-establishing gliding\r\nmotions, causes absorption of effused materials, and restores the\r\naffected part to a normal condition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.\r\nMuscular fibre highly\r\nmagnified.]\r\n\r\nThe deformed limb is straightened by the filling out of the\r\nmuscle-cells, and increasing the length and also the nutrition of the\r\naffected muscles. No pulling or _forced extension_ is required.\r\nDeformity ceases when the conditions upon which it depends are removed\r\nby rational appliances, which are always agreeable. No brace, splints,\r\nor other confining appliances are necessary, except in rare cases in\r\nwhich the bones are very badly distorted.\r\n\r\nIn withered and deformed limbs, resulting from infantile paralysis, the\r\nmanipulator furnishes the most agreeable, direct, and certain remedy. It\r\nrestores nutrition, sensation, and power, and dispenses almost wholly\r\nwith mechanical supports. Club-feet, wry neck, spinal curvature,\r\nhip-joint disease, white swellings, and stiffened joints, are all\r\nreadily amendable to the curative effects of motion administered by the\r\nmanipulator and other machinery.\r\n\r\nContracted and shortened muscles are gradually lengthened by vigorous,\r\nlong-continued, and frequently repeated rubbing with the manipulator\r\nacross their longitudinal fibers; bound-down and confined tendons are\r\nliberated and normal movements established.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF WOMEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nUterine and ovarian congestion, chronic inflammation, discharges, morbid\r\nenlargement, prolapsus, anteversion and retroversion, anteflexion and\r\nretroflexion, and other derangements of the womb and its appendages, are\r\nradically cured by the vibratory, rubbing, kneading, and other\r\nmovements, administered through the manipulator and other mechanical\r\nappliances employed at the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute.\r\n\r\nTo those who are tired of taking medicine, this mode of treatment\r\ncommends itself as being both agreeable and efficient. There is no case\r\ntoo weak, nervous, or helpless for the use of this curative agent. It is\r\nentirely devoid of objectionable features, being _always applied outside\r\nthe clothing_.\r\n\r\nCAUSE OF FEMALE WEAKNESS. The true relations of cause and effect are\r\nvery liable to be misunderstood, when considering the various diseases\r\nincident to the organs contained in the female pelvis. Treatment\r\nintended to be remedial is therefore very often misdirected and fails to\r\nafford relief, positive injury frequently resulting instead. When the\r\nnature of these diseases is properly understood, their cure can be\r\neffected with comparative ease.\r\n\r\nThese diseases are always attended with weakness, which is often very\r\ngreat, of the muscles that hold the diseased organs in position. The\r\nmuscles forming the walls of the abdomen, and the diaphragm, or midriff,\r\nall of which are concerned in the act of respiration, become feeble and\r\nonly partially perform their functions. In health, they act constantly,\r\neven during sleep, producing a rhythmical movement, which is\r\ncommunicated to the contents of the abdominal and pelvic cavities. This\r\nmotion promotes a healthy circulation in the parts. In almost all\r\naffections of the pelvic organs, this normal condition is greatly\r\ndiminished.\r\n\r\nDiminution of the motions of respiration is attended with an increase of\r\nthe amount of the blood in the pelvic organs, constituting an\r\nengorgement of the parts, called congestion, or inflammation. This gives\r\nrise to enlargement of the womb, ulcerations, tumors, and a multitude of\r\nkindred secondary effects, usually considered as the primary disease and\r\ntreated as such. The contents of the cavity of the trunk, weighing\r\nseveral pounds, are allowed to gravitate down and rest upon the contents\r\nof the pelvis, forcing the congested uterus and ovaries down out of\r\ntheir natural positions, and often bending or tipping the womb in\r\nvarious directions. A long list of symptoms follows as the natural\r\nconsequence of these abnormal conditions.\r\n\r\nRATIONAL TREATMENT. Ovarian congestion and inflammation, inflammation of\r\nthe uterus, ulceration of this organ, deranged menstruation, leucorrhea\r\nwith the attendant pain, nervousness, and other derangements depending\r\nupon loss of supporting power in the abdominal muscles, all result from\r\nloss of the _natural_ motions of respiration, and consequent deranged\r\ncirculation. These several conditions can be cured by removing their\r\ncause. When the power of the parts involved in the weakness is restored,\r\nall these morbid conditions disappear. Judicious cultivation of power in\r\nthe weakened supports is attended with certain curative results. This is\r\nbest accomplished by mechanical motion, by which the normal circulation\r\nis restored, inflammations and congestions are subdued, displacements\r\ncorrected, ulcers healed, and functional activity is re-established.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECAPITULATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nMotion properly transmitted to the human system by mechanical apparatus\r\nis transformed into other forms of force identical with vital energy, by\r\nwhich the ordinary processes of the system are greatly promoted.\r\n\r\nIt increases animal heat and nervous and muscular power to the normal\r\nstandard.\r\n\r\nIt removes engorgement or local impediments to the circulation.\r\n\r\nThe electrical induction produced renders it a most efficacious remedy\r\nfor paralysis of all kinds.\r\n\r\nIt removes interstitial fluids and causes rapid absorption and\r\ndisappearance of solid and fluid accumulations.\r\n\r\nIt is a powerful alterative, or blood-purifier, increasing oxidation and\r\nstimulating excretion.\r\n\r\nIt diminishes chronic nervous irritability and promotes sleep.\r\n\r\nDeformities are easily cured without the cutting of tendons, or use of\r\nmechanical supports.\r\n\r\nIt hardens the flesh by increasing muscular development and improves\r\ndigestion and nutrition.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION\r\n\r\nINCORPORATED UNDER STATUTE ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nDr. R.V.

Although occupied at the time by a large\r\nnumber of invalids, yet, through the extraordinary exertions of the\r\nFaculty and employees, all were safely removed from the building without\r\ninjury to any one. The Board of Trustees took prompt steps to rebuild,\r\nfor the accommodation of the many sufferers who apply, to avail\r\nthemselves of the skill, facilities and advantages of treatment which\r\nsuch a perfectly equipped establishment affords. Profiting by the\r\nexperience afforded by several years' occupancy of the original\r\nInvalids' Hotel building, which at the date of its erection was the\r\nlargest and most complete establishment of its kind in the world, we\r\nbelieve we have, in the building of the elegant structure illustrated\r\nherein, made great improvements over the original Invalids' Hotel, for\r\nthe accommodation of our patients. Although our new building has only\r\nbeen occupied about two years, yet almost immediately our business\r\nrequired the erection of a very large addition thereto, to accommodate\r\nour growing practice. This large _Annex_, which is about the size of the\r\noriginal building, has ever since been kept well filled with patients,\r\nhailing from every State and Territory of the United States, Canada and\r\noccasionally from a foreign country,\r\n\r\nTHE INVALIDS' HOTEL AND SURGICAL INSTITUTE IS PLEASANTLY SITUATED AT NO.\r\n663 MAIN STREET,\r\n\r\nin the city of Buffalo, just above and outside the business and bustle\r\nof this Queen City of the Lakes. It is easily reached from the railroad\r\ndepots by the Exchange and Main Street car lines (see map on last page\r\nof this book). It is a substantially built brick building, trimmed with\r\nsandstone, well lighted and provided with a patent hydraulic elevator,\r\nso that its upper stories are quite as desirable as any, being more\r\nquiet than those lower down. It is well provided with fire escapes, and,\r\nin fact, nothing has been neglected that can add to the comfort and\r\nhome-like make-up of this popular national resort for the invalid and\r\nafflicted. Great pains and expense have been assumed in providing\r\nperfect ventilation for every room and part of the building.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Grand Entrance.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ante-room.--Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute.]\r\n\r\nThe surroundings of the Hotel are very pleasant, it being located in the\r\nfinest built part of the city, among the most elegant residences.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTAFF OF PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnly men who are, by thorough education and experience, especially\r\nfitted to fill their respective positions, have been chosen to serve as\r\nphysicians and surgeons in this institution. After having spent a very\r\nlarge sum of money in erecting and furnishing this national resort for\r\ninvalids with every requirement and facility for the successful\r\ntreatment of all classes of chronic diseases, it is the determination of\r\nthe Board of Directors that the Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons shall\r\nbe superior in culture, experience and skill.\r\n\r\nWe have not the space to speak, individually, of the eighteen\r\nprofessional gentlemen composing the Faculty, but will say that among\r\nthem are those whose long connection with the World's Dispensary and\r\nSurgical Institute has given them great experience and rendered them\r\n_experts_ in their specialties. Several of them had previously\r\ndistinguished themselves in both private and hospital practice, had held\r\nimportant chairs as lecturers and teachers in Medical Colleges, and had\r\nfilled responsible positions in military and civil hospitals; also in\r\nsome of the most noted Asylums, Dispensaries, and Sanitary Institutions\r\nin the land.\r\n\r\nWith such a staff of Physicians and Surgeons, efficient and trained\r\nnurses, and with all the most approved sanitary, medical and surgical\r\nappliances which study, experience, invention and the most liberal\r\nexpenditure of money, can produce and bring together in one institution,\r\nthe Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute affords the afflicted unusual\r\nopportunities for relief.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GRAND ENTRANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe entrance to the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute is covered by\r\na lofty porch of beautiful design, the roof of which is supported upon\r\nheavy iron columns. Above the massive double doors, through which the\r\nvisitor enters, are large, heavy panels of beautifully wrought stained\r\nglass, on which the words \"Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute\" stand\r\nout conspicuously.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\nGentlemen's Reception-room,\r\nInvalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST FLOOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first floor of the building is reached through a beautifully\r\nfinished vestibule, by a short flight of broad, easy stairs, and once\r\ninside the visitor is struck by the beauty of design as well as by the\r\nhome-like appearance of the surroundings. The wood-work is mainly of\r\nhard woods, oak and cherry predominating. In a large part of the house\r\nthe floors are of oak, with a cherry border, neatly finished in oil and\r\nshellac, and covered with rich rugs and elegant carpets of the very best\r\nquality.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ladies' Parlor.--Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute.]\r\n\r\nOn the first floor is the gentlemen's reception-room, which is thronged\r\nwith patients from early in the morning until late in the afternoon. It\r\nis entirely distinct from the large reception-room and parlors for lady\r\npatients, and the utmost privacy is secured throughout the whole\r\narrangement of the Institution. On this floor are the suites of offices,\r\nparlors, and private consultation-rooms, some fifteen in all; also a\r\nwell furnished reading-room and circulating library, for the use of the\r\ninmates of the Institution. On all sides are beautifully frescoed walls\r\nadorned with numerous choice engravings and other pictures. All the\r\nrooms throughout the house are furnished in the best of style, and in a\r\nmanner to afford the utmost comfort and cheerfulness of surroundings for\r\nthe sick and afflicted who seek this remedial resort. The Turkish and\r\nother baths are elegantly fitted up on the first floor, opposite the\r\nreading-room.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UPPER FLOORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbove the first, or main floor, the building is divided into separate\r\nrooms and suites of rooms for the accommodation of patients. All are\r\nwell lighted, have high ceilings, and are cheerful and well ventilated\r\napartments. On the second floor is the large medical library and medical\r\ncouncil-room, for the exclusive use of the Faculty, also the\r\nmuseum-room, which contains a large and valuable collection of\r\nanatomical and morbid specimens, many of them being obtained from cases\r\ntreated in this Institution. On this floor are also suites of rooms,\r\noccupied by the Bureau of Medical Correspondence, wherein from ten to\r\ntwelve physicians, each supplied with the improved graphophone, are\r\nconstantly employed in attending to the vast correspondence received\r\nfrom invalids residing in all parts of the United States and Canada.\r\nEvery important case receives the careful consideration of a council\r\ncomposed of from three to five of these expert specialists, before being\r\nfinally passed upon and prescribed for.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Library and Reading-room--Invalids'\r\nHotel and Surgical Institute.]\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE THIRD FLOOR\r\n\r\n\r\nare the large treatment-rooms, supplied with all the apparatus and\r\nappliances for the successful management of every chronic malady\r\nincident to humanity. Electrical apparatus of the latest and most\r\napproved kinds, some of it driven and operated by steam-power, dry\r\ncupping and equalizing-treatment apparatus, \"vitalization\" apparatus,\r\nnumerous and most ingenious rubbing and manipulating apparatus and\r\nmachinery, driven by steam-power, are among the almost innumerable\r\ncurative agencies that are here brought into use as aids in the cure of\r\nhuman ailments. Our\r\n\r\nELECTRICAL OUTFIT\r\n\r\n[Illustration: President Pierce's Business Office--Invalids' Hotel and\r\nSurgical Institute.]\r\n\r\nis the finest to be found in any sanitarium in the United States and, we\r\nbelieve, in the world. There are two forty-cell galvanic batteries with\r\nswitch boards for controlling the voltage, or force, from the whole\r\npower to one-fortieth of this amount, at the will of the physician.\r\nSafe-guards in the shape of milli-ampere meters continually indicate to\r\nthe operator the force of the current. There is a dynamo for charging\r\nthe storage batteries, which may be used in a patient's room when this\r\nmethod is found more convenient or more comfortable for the invalid.\r\nThere are two static or Franklin machines. These are used when the\r\nmilder current is desired, and for spraying, sparking, etc. One of the\r\ninstruments is of high voltage and furnishes us with the X rays for\r\nexamining the interior parts of the body. The largest treatment room\r\nalso contains a powerful ozone generator, operated by a dynamo. This\r\nsupplies the room with allotropic oxygen and is invaluable in treating\r\ndiseases of the lungs and air passages. This supplies the patient with\r\nvitalized air, equal to the most salubrious atmosphere in any part of\r\nthe globe.\r\n\r\nBeyond this and separated by a court, across which is an iron bridge,\r\nare the large dispensing-rooms, stocked with drugs and medical compounds\r\nof almost endless variety, and representing every branch of the _materia\r\nmedica_. Here all medicines prescribed are most carefully and specially\r\nprepared for each individual case. Those to be sent away by mail or\r\nexpress, to patients being treated at a distance, are placed in trays,\r\nwith full directions for use, and sent to another large room, where they\r\nare carefully packed, and shipped thence to their destination.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURTH FLOOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the fourth floor are located the surgical operating-rooms and\r\nsurgical ward. There are also a large number of nice, large, well\r\nfurnished separate rooms on this floor, used principally for the\r\naccommodation of surgical cases. Strong, broad, iron staircases connect\r\nall the upper floors with the ground, so that in case of fire, patients\r\nneed have no fear of being unable to get out safely. In fact, the\r\nbuilding has been constructed so as to render the rapid spread of fire\r\nthrough it impossible, all the floors being laid on cement.\r\n\r\n\r\nA STEAM PASSENGER ELEVATOR\r\n\r\n\r\nis provided, so that the upper floors are quite as desirable as those\r\nlower down. The dining-rooms for gentlemen, as well as those for\r\nladies, are located in the basement, which is reached either by\r\nstairways or by the elevator. The kitchen, store-rooms, chill-rooms,\r\npantries, and all culinary arrangements are also in the basement.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRE-PROOF VAULTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSix large fire-proof vaults are provided in this building in which to\r\npreserve, secure from observation, as well as from fire, all records of\r\ncases examined and treated by the Faculty.\r\n\r\nThroughout all this vast building the visitor is struck with the\r\nwonderful order and system with which every detail is carried out.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BATH DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A glimpse at the Turkish Bath Department.]\r\n\r\nThe Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute, as hereinbefore indicated,\r\nis provided with Turkish, and other approved baths, with a\r\ntreatment-room, fitted up with vacuum and movement-treatment apparatus\r\nof the most modern and approved style. These and much more ingeniously\r\ndevised apparatus and appliances are brought into use in a great variety\r\nof chronic affections with marvelously successful results. A perfect\r\nsystem of physical training, especially adapted to the wants of the\r\ninvalid and weak, and most skillfully conducted and applied, is not the\r\nleast important among the many advantages that the chronic sufferers\r\nhere find.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SURGICAL DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Surgical Department, every instrument and appliance approved by\r\nthe modern operator is provided, and many and ingenious are the\r\ninstruments and devices that the Faculty of this institution have\r\ninvented and perfected to meet the wants of their numerous cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR REMEDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the prescribing of remedies for disease, the Staff resort to the\r\nwhole broad field of _materia medica_, allowing themselves to be\r\nhampered by no school, _ism_,_pathy_, or sect. The medicines employed are\r\nall prepared by skilled chemists and pharmacists, and the greatest care\r\nis exercised to have them manufactured from the freshest and purest\r\ningredients. Our Faculty probably employ a greater number and variety of\r\nextracts from native roots, barks and herbs in their practice than are\r\nused in any other invalids' resort in the land. All of the vegetable\r\nextracts employed in our practice are prepared in our own Laboratory.\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULATION OF DIET.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe table is supplied with an abundance of wholesome and nutritious\r\nfood, especially adapted and prepared to suit the invalid, it being\r\nvaried to suit each particular case. The Faculty recognize the\r\nimportance of proper food as one of the greatest factors in the\r\ntreatment of chronic diseases. While properly regulating and restricting\r\nthe food of the invalid when necessary, they also recognize the fact\r\nthat many are benefited by a liberal diet of the most substantial food,\r\nas steaks, eggs, oysters, milk, and other very nutritious articles of\r\ndiet, which are always provided in abundance for those for whom they are\r\nsuited.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: View of Lake and Boat-house.--Buffalo Park.]\r\n\r\nFrom previous experience somewhere, some people get the impression that\r\nthey are to be half starved at such an institution as this. If this is\r\nthe case anywhere it is not so here, as any one who has ever resided at\r\nour sanitarium will attest.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRAINED ATTENDANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA sufficient number of trained and experienced nurses are employed, that\r\nthose requiring attendance may have the very best of care.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOOD ORDER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe institution is conducted in an orderly manner, that the utmost quiet\r\nmay be secured. The Faculty insist, upon the part of the invalid, while\r\nunder treatment, on the observance of habits of regularity in eating,\r\nsleeping, bathing and exercise. Only by such observance of hygienic laws\r\ncan they succeed in their course of remedial training, and make the\r\ntreatment curative.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMUSEMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile insisting upon strict observance of rules established for the good\r\nof the patient, they do not make their requirements so rigid as to\r\ninterfere with the comfort and enjoyment of their patients, but, on the\r\ncontrary, endeavor, in every manner possible, to provide innocent and\r\nentertaining amusements for all, recognizing the great importance of\r\npleasant occupation of the mind, as an essential part of the treatment.\r\nHence the introduction of music, amusing games, light reading, and\r\nkindred agencies for pleasant entertainment, is not neglected.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNPARALLELED SUCCESS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: One of the Private Consultation-rooms, Ladies'\r\nDepartment.]\r\n\r\nThe founder of this institution commenced, many years ago, with little\r\ncapital, to build up a business in the treatment of chronic diseases and\r\ndevoted himself diligently to that end. His reputation for skill in his\r\nchosen field of practice gradually extended until, to-day, his fame and\r\nthat of the World's Dispensary and Invalids' Hotel and Surgical\r\nInstitute, are simply world-wide. As the business increased those\r\neminent for skill have been induced to join the Faculty, until eighteen\r\nprofessional gentlemen, each devoting his attention to a special branch\r\nof practice, constitute the Medical and Surgical Staff.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Soldiers' Monument.--Lafayette Park, Buffalo.]\r\n\r\nOne reason why we excel in the treatment of _chronic diseases_ is the\r\nfact that we are supplied with all the modern improvements in the way of\r\ninstruments, appliances and remedial agents used in the healing art, the\r\nexpense of which deters the local physician in general practice from\r\nprocuring, for the treatment of the limited number of cases that come\r\nwithin the circuit of his practice. The treatment of such cases requires\r\nspecial attention and special study to be successful.\r\n\r\n\r\nA COMMON SENSE VIEW.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known fact, that appeals to the judgment of every thinking\r\nperson, that a physician who devotes his whole time to the study and\r\ninvestigation of a certain class of diseases, must become better\r\nqualified to treat them than he who attempts to treat every ill to which\r\nflesh is heir, without giving special attention to any particular class\r\nof diseases. Men, in all ages of the world, who have _made their marks_,\r\nor who have become famous, have devoted their lives to some special\r\nbranch of science, art or literature.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIBERALITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe wage no war against any physician, no matter what school of medicine\r\nhe may represent; but, on the other hand, we invite the co-operation of\r\nall regular physicians. We are always ready and willing to impart to\r\nthem any information or render any assistance that will be of mutual\r\nbenefit to them and their patients.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS\r\n\r\n\r\ndo not travel to solicit practice, having all the business that they can\r\nattend to at our institution, nor do we employ any agents to travel and\r\npeddle or otherwise sell our medicines. If any one engaged in such\r\nbusiness, represents himself as in any way connected with our\r\ninstitutions, he is a swindler and should be apprehended and prosecuted\r\nas such. And any one who will give us such information as will lead to\r\nthe arrest and conviction of any person so misrepresenting will be\r\nliberally rewarded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Undergoing Examination of the Lungs\r\nat the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute.]\r\n\r\nWhile not permitting any member of our professional staff to travel and\r\nsolicit practice, yet we are always willing to accommodate and send a\r\nspecialist to visit important or critical cases in consultation, or\r\notherwise, or to perform important surgical operations as explained on\r\npage 971 of this book.\r\n\r\nLet none deceive you by representing that they have heretofore been\r\nconnected with our institution and have thereby learned our original and\r\nimproved methods of treatment. We have a large and competent Staff of\r\nSpecialists and while we have sometimes found it necessary to make\r\nchanges, yet we always manage to retain the most expert and skillful, as\r\nwe cannot afford to part with the services of those who excel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chemists' Department.--Invalids' Hotel and Surgical\r\nInstitute.]\r\n\r\nBy adopting similar names to those which have long designated our\r\nworld-famed institutions, some have endeavored to deceive and mislead\r\ninvalids who were seeking relief. Others have named so-called \"Electric\"\r\nTrusses, \"Liver Pads,\" and other contrivances after our President,\r\nthereby expecting to reap benefits from Dr. Pierce's well-known\r\nprofessional standing. Neither the Doctor nor this Association have any\r\ninterest in any such articles.\r\n\r\nNO BRANCHES.--Remember we have no branches except the one at No. 3 New\r\nOxford Street, London, England.\r\n\r\nThose desiring to consult us by letter, should address all\r\ncommunications plainly to\r\n\r\n    <b>World's Dispensary Medical Association,\r\n    _No. 663 MAIN STREET,_\r\n    BUFFALO, N.Y.</b>\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWORLD'S DISPENSARY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe immense building erected and occupied by the World's Dispensary\r\nMedical Association as a Laboratory, wherein are manufactured our Dr.\r\nPierce's Standard Family Medicines, as well as all the various\r\nTinctures, Fluid Extracts and other pharmaceutical preparations used by\r\nthe Staff of Physicians and Surgeons of the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical\r\nInstitute in their practice, is not inappropriately called the _World's\r\nDispensary_, for within its walls is prepared a series of remedies of\r\nsuch exceeding merit that they have acquired world-wide fame, and are\r\nsold in vast quantities in nearly every civilized country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: World's Dispensary.--New Laboratory Building.]\r\n\r\nThe structure, located at 660 to 670 Washington Street, immediately in\r\nthe rear of the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute, is of brick,\r\nwith sandstone trimmings, six stories high, and 100 feet square. Its\r\nmost striking architectural features exteriorly are massiveness,\r\ncombined with grace and beauty of outline, and great strength.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BASEMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe basement or first story opens on a level with the Washington Street\r\nsidewalk, and is occupied by a plant of two large boilers, which supply\r\nthe steam to run a huge American engine, of 100 horse-power, built by\r\nthe American Engine Co., Bound Brook, N.J. It drives all the machinery\r\nof the establishment, including drug mills, pill machines, packing\r\nmachinery, a large number of printing presses, folding machines,\r\nstitching, trimming, and many other machines, located on the different\r\nfloors, and used in the manufacture of medicines, books, pamphlets,\r\ncirculars, posters, and other printed matter. On this floor is located\r\nsteam bottle-washing machinery, and also the shipping department. Here\r\nmay be seen huge piles of medicine, boxed, marked, and ready for\r\nshipment to all parts of the civilized world. A large steam freight\r\nelevator leads from this to the floors above.\r\n\r\n\r\nMACHINERY.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Postal, Advertising, Wrapping and Mailing Departments.]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the power engine just mentioned is a 25 horse-power\r\nupright engine for running the dynamo for electric lighting, with a\r\ncapacity of three hundred (300) lights. This engine and dynamo were also\r\nmanufactured for us by the American Engine Company of Bound Brook, N.J.\r\nThere is a small dynamo with a capacity of one hundred (100) lights used\r\nduring the day to light safes, vaults, dark closets and hallways. All\r\nthe offices and rooms of patients are supplied with electric light, as\r\nwell as illuminating gas. An automatic Worthington pump is also located\r\nin the basement. This supplies the elevator and sprinkling system. The\r\nsprinklers come into play only in case of fire, when they are\r\nself-acting. This pump at its best is capable of forcing nearly two\r\nhundred gallons of water a minute. There is no place in which pure water\r\nis more desirable than in the manufacture of medicines. Our New York\r\nfilter could, if such a large quantity were ever required, furnish the\r\nDispensary with one hundred (100) barrels of pure water a day. Just\r\nbeyond the south wall and buried several feet under ground is a\r\nboiler-shaped tank capable of storing ten thousand (10,000) gallons of\r\nmedicine.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAIN FLOOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main or second floor of the Dispensary is entered from Main Street,\r\nthrough a hall leading from the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute.\r\nOn this floor are located business offices, counting-room, the\r\nadvertising department and mailing rooms. Large, fire-proof vaults are\r\nprovided for the safe keeping of books, papers, and valuables, whilst\r\nthe counting-room and offices are elegantly finished in hard woods, and\r\npresent a beautiful and grand appearance.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD FLOOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn this floor are the Association's extensive printing and binding\r\nworks. Fourteen large presses, driven by power, with numerous folding\r\nmachines, trimming, cutting, and stitching machinery, are constantly\r\nrunning in this department. Here is printed and bound Dr. Pierce's\r\npopular work of over a thousand pages, denominated \"The People's Common\r\nSense Medical Adviser,\" over 1,200,000 copies of which have been sold.\r\nMillions of pocket memorandum books, pamphlets, circulars and cards are\r\nalso issued from this department and scattered broadcast to every\r\nquarter of the globe.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURTH FLOOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nLarge mills for crushing, grinding and pulverizing roots, barks, herbs,\r\nand other drugs occupy a considerable part of this floor. Extensive\r\ndrying-rooms, in which articles to be ground in the drug mills are\r\nproperly dried, are also located upon this floor, as are also thousands\r\nof reams of paper ready for printing the different books, pamphlets,\r\nlabels, etc. In large rooms set aside for that purpose, are stored vast\r\nquantities of labels and wrappers, for use in putting up medicines.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIFTH FLOOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn this floor is located ingeniously devised filling and bottling\r\nmachinery, also rooms for labeling, wrapping, and packing medicines;\r\nothers are occupied for the storage of crude drugs, glass, corks, and\r\nsupplies for use in the general business.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIXTH FLOOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis entire floor is occupied with mixing, percolating, distilling,\r\nfiltering, and other processes employed in the manufacturing of\r\nmedicines. Every process is conducted under the watchful care of an\r\nexperienced chemist and pharmacist, and in the most perfect and orderly\r\nmanner; the apparatus employed being of the most approved character.\r\nHere are manufactured all the various medicinal preparations and\r\ncompounds prescribed by the Faculty, in the treatment of special cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Section of Chemical Laboratory.--World's Dispensary.]\r\n\r\nIn all departments of this vast business establishment, the visitor is\r\nstruck with the perfect system which everywhere prevails, and the\r\nwonderful accuracy with which every process and transaction is carried\r\non and consummated; hence the uniformity of purity and strength for\r\nwhich the medicines here manufactured have so long been celebrated. To\r\nthis, also, is due much of the marvelous success attained in the\r\ndepartment established for the special treatment of chronic and\r\nobstinate cases of disease. In this department the Faculty are not at\r\nall limited or hampered in prescribing, and do not confine themselves in\r\nthe least to the proprietary or standard medicines manufactured for\r\ngeneral sale through druggists, but employ a series of curative agents\r\nunsurpassed in variety and range of application. They aim to carefully\r\nadapt their prescriptions to each individual case.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE\r\n\r\nINVALIDS' HOTEL AND SURGICAL INSTITUTE\r\n\r\n_SOME OF THE CAUSES THAT LED TO ITS ERECTION, AND THE ADVANTAGES WHICH\r\nIT AFFORDS._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: One of the Private Consultation-rooms, Gentlemen's\r\nDepartment.]\r\n\r\nThe destinies of institutions, like those of men, are often determined\r\nby pre-existing causes. The destinies of some men are like those of\r\nway-side plants, springing up without other apparent cause than the\r\ncaprice of nature, developing without any apparent aim, yielding no\r\nperfected fruit, and finally, dying, leaving scarcely a trace of their\r\nexistence. Thus it is with institutions which have their origin only in\r\nman's caprice. To be enduring, they must be founded upon the needs and\r\nnecessities of humanity. Many of the great men of the world owe their\r\ngreatness more to surrounding circumstances than to the genius within\r\nthem. The highest genius can be dwarfed or deformed by the force of\r\nadverse circumstances; hence the poetic truth of Gray in those exquisite\r\nlines:\r\n\r\n    \"Some mute inglorious Milton here may lie,\r\n    Some Cromwell guiltless of his country's blood.\"\r\n\r\nOpportunity is the guiding star of genius. Without it, genius would\r\ndrift hither and thither upon the restless, ever-changing waves of\r\ncircumstance, never casting anchor in a secure haven. Upon opportunity,\r\ntoo, depends the success of institutions. By opportunity we mean a real\r\nand acknowledged public want. Whoever undertakes to supply this want\r\nfinds himself upon the crest-wave of prosperity. It was to supply such a\r\nwant that this institution was erected.\r\n\r\n\r\nA REMEDIAL HOME.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the seventy millions of people living in the United States to-day, it\r\nis estimated that nearly twelve millions are sufferers from chronic\r\ndisease. Think for a moment! Twelve millions of people slowly but surely\r\ndying by the insidious and fatal development of chronic diseases! This\r\nis an appalling fact. And yet this is the very class of diseases with\r\nwhich the general practitioner is least familiar.\r\n\r\nAs a general practitioner of the healing art, fresh from _curriculum_,\r\nthe founder of this institution early realized that the grand\r\nunpardonable sin of the medical profession was the neglect to more\r\nthoroughly study and investigate this class of diseases.\r\n\r\nThe profession is diligently cauterizing and poulticing the sores which\r\nnow and then appear on the surface, but the internal chronic disease, of\r\nwhich these are merely the external signs, is too often overlooked or\r\nneglected.\r\n\r\nSome years ago we devised and put into practical operation a method of\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATING PATIENTS AT THEIR HOMES,\r\n\r\n\r\nwithout requiring them to undergo personal examinations. We reasoned\r\nthat the physician has abundant opportunity to accurately determine the\r\nnature of most chronic diseases without ever seeing the patient. In\r\nsubstantiating that proposition, we cited the perfect _accuracy_ with\r\nwhich scientists are enabled to deduce the most minute particulars in\r\ntheir several departments, which appears almost miraculous, if we view\r\nthe subject in the light of the early ages. Take, for example, the\r\nelectro-magnetic telegraph, the greatest invention of the age. Is it not\r\na marvelous degree of accuracy which enables an operator to _exactly_\r\nlocate a fracture in a sub-marine cable nearly three thousand miles\r\nlong? Our venerable \"clerk of the weather\" has become so thoroughly\r\nfamiliar with the most wayward elements of nature that he can accurately\r\npredict their movements. He can sit in Washington and foretell what the\r\nweather will be in Florida or New York, as well as if hundreds of miles\r\ndid not intervene between him and the places named. And so in all\r\ndepartments of modern science, what is required is the knowledge of\r\ncertain _signs_. From these, scientists deduce accurate conclusions\r\nregardless of distance. A few fossils sent to the expert geologist\r\nenables him to accurately determine the rock-formation from which they\r\nwere taken. He can describe it to you as perfectly as if a cleft of it\r\nwere lying on his table. So also the chemist can determine the\r\nconstitution of the sun as accurately as if that luminary were not\r\nninety-five million miles from his laboratory. The sun sends certain\r\n_signs_ over the \"infinitude of space,\" which the chemist classifies by\r\npassing them through the spectroscope. Only the presence of certain\r\nsubstances could produce these solar signs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Medical Library and Council-room.--Invalids' Hotel and\r\nSurgical Institute.]\r\n\r\nSo, also, in medical science,\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASE HAS CERTAIN UNMISTAKABLE SIGNS,\r\n\r\n\r\nor symptoms, and, by reason of this fact, we have been enabled to\r\noriginate and perfect a system of determining with the greatest accuracy\r\nthe nature of chronic diseases without seeing and personally examining\r\nour patients. In recognizing diseases without a personal examination of\r\nthe patient, we claim to possess no miraculous powers. We obtain our\r\nknowledge of the patient's disease by the practical application of\r\nwell-established principles of modern science to the practice of\r\nmedicine. And it is to the accuracy with which this system has endowed\r\nus that we owe our almost world-wide reputation for the skillful\r\ntreatment of all lingering, or chronic, affections. This system of\r\npractice, with the marvelous success which has been attained through it,\r\ndemonstrates the fact that diseases display certain phenomena, which,\r\nbeing subjected to scientific analysis, furnish abundant and\r\nunmistakable data to guide the judgment of the skillful practitioner\r\naright in determining the nature of diseased conditions.\r\n\r\nSo successful has been this method of treating patients at a distance\r\nthat there is scarcely a city or a village in the United States that is\r\nnot represented by one or more cases upon the \"Records of Practice\" at\r\nthe Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute. In all chronic diseases that\r\nare curable by medical treatment, it is only in very rare cases that we\r\ncannot do as well for the patient while he or she remains at home, as if\r\nhere in person to be examined. But we annually treat hundreds of cases\r\nrequiring surgical operations and careful after-treatment, and in these\r\ncases our Invalids' Hotel, or home, is indispensable. Here the patient\r\nhas the services not only of the most skillful surgeons, but also, what\r\nis quite as necessary in the after treatment, of thoroughly trained and\r\nskilled nurses.\r\n\r\nWhat should be the essential characteristics of an Invalids' Home?\r\n\r\n\r\nCLIMATE.\r\n\r\n\r\nObviously, the most important of these characteristics is _climate_.\r\nClimatology, from being a mere speculative theory, has arisen to the\r\ndeserved rank of a science. The influence of the climate of a country on\r\nthe national character has long been observed and acknowledged. The\r\nlanguid but passionate temperaments of the South are like its volcanoes,\r\nnow quiet and silent, anon bursting forth with terrible activity,\r\nflooding entire cities with molten fire; or, like its skies, now sunny,\r\ncloudless, an hour hence convulsed with lightnings and deluging the\r\nearth with passionate rain; or like its winds, to-day soft, balmy, with\r\nhealing on their wings, to-night the wind fiend, the destroying simoom,\r\nrushing through the land, withering and scorching every flower and blade\r\nof herbage on its way. On the other hand, the calm, phlegmatic\r\ntemperament of the North accords well with her silent mountains, her\r\nserener skies, and her less vehement, but chilling winds. The South,\r\ntoo, is the native home of the most violent acute diseases, such as\r\nyellow fever and cholera. But, aside from this general climatic\r\ninfluence, there is the yet more restricted one of locality. It has\r\noften been observed that certain classes of diseases are most prevalent\r\nin certain localities, the prevalence in every instance being due to\r\npeculiarities of climate.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTREME HEALTHFULNESS OF BUFFALO.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the published records of the examination for military service in the\r\narmy, during our late civil war, this fact was clearly and definitely\r\nstated, and maps were prepared and presented showing the comparative\r\nprevalence of certain diseases in the several States and districts\r\nrepresented. The maps are prepared by a graduation of color, the lighter\r\nshades indicating the localities where the special disease under\r\nconsideration is least prevalent; and it is a very significant and\r\nimportant fact that in all chronic diseases not due to occupation or\r\naccident, Buffalo and its immediate vicinity is marked by the lighter\r\nshades. Thus, in epilepsy, paralysis, scrofula, rheumatism, and\r\nconsumption, our city is little more than tinted with the several colors\r\nused to denote these diseases.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Patient's Room.--Invalids' Hotel\r\nand Surgical Institute.]\r\n\r\nThere is a popular, but unfounded, belief that Buffalo is a hot-bed for\r\npulmonary diseases. This idea could have originated only in an ignorant\r\ndisregard of facts; for medical statistics prove that in her freedom\r\nfrom this class of diseases she is unrivaled by any city in America, not\r\nexcepting those on the seaboard.\r\n\r\n\r\nEVIDENCE OF HEALTH STATISTICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCompare, if you please, the statistics of Buffalo with those of the\r\ngreat Eastern cities in this respect. In Boston and New York the\r\ndeath-rate from consumption shows a ratio of about 1 to 5 of the whole\r\nnumber of deaths. In Baltimore and Philadelphia the ratio is 1 to 6,\r\nwhile in Buffalo the death rate from consumption is only 1 to 10--very\r\nremarkable difference in favor of our city. Only last summer a gentleman\r\nresiding in the eastern part of our State collected and compared the\r\nhealth statistics for 1876 of all the prominent cities in the United\r\nStates. The result showed that\r\n\r\n\r\nBUFFALO OUTRANKS ALL IN HEALTHFULNESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA great deal of precious breath has been expended in blustering about\r\n\"Buffalo zephyrs,\" as our delightful lake breezes are sometimes\r\nironically termed. It seems to be a popular belief among our sister\r\ncities that old Boreas has chosen Buffalo for his headquarters. When we\r\nhear a person dilating upon \"Buffalo's terrific winds,\" we are reminded\r\nof one of our lady acquaintances who recently returned from a European\r\ntour. She was asked how she enjoyed her sea voyage, and she replied,\r\n\"Oh, it was delightful, really charming! There is something so grand\r\nabout the sea!\" We were not a little surprised at this enthusiastic\r\noutburst, as we had been told by a member of her party that the lady had\r\nindustriously vomited her way to Hamburg and back again. But the lady's\r\nenthusiasm was easily explained. It is fashionable to characterize sea\r\nvoyages as delightful, charming, etc. Now, we suspect this popular\r\nnotion about our \"trying winds\" is traceable to the same source. It has\r\nbecome customary to call Buffalo a \"windy place,\" and so, when the\r\ntraveler feels a slight lake breeze, he imagines it to be a terrific\r\ngale. Whatever may have originated this notion, certain it is that it is\r\nutterly, undeniably false; and, in making this denial, we are not alone\r\ndependent upon observation, but upon the\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS OF SCIENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe issue of July 18, 1874, of the Buffalo _Commercial Advertiser_,\r\ncontained a series of tables, furnished by the Signal Service Bureau,\r\nshowing the velocity of the wind at eleven prominent cities for the year\r\n1873. An examination of the table shows that the total velocity for the\r\nyear was the _lowest in Buffalo_ of any of the lake ports; while\r\nPhiladelphia and New York showed far higher aggregates of velocity than\r\nour city. On this subject, in the issue of August 21st of the same year,\r\nthe editor pleasantly remarks: \"Only the interior and southern seaboard\r\ncities, and not many of them, show a lower total velocity of wind than\r\nis marked against this city; and as for those places, heaven help their\r\nunfortunate inhabitants in the sultry nights of the summer season, when\r\nthey are gasping in vain for a breath of that pure, cool lake air, which\r\nbrings refreshing slumbers to the people of blessed, breezy Buffalo.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEQUABILITY OF CLIMATE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\nOne of our Physician's Rooms--Bureau of Correspondence--Invalids'\r\nHotel and Surgical Institute.]\r\n\r\nThen, in regard to _equability of climate_, the great desideratum for\r\ninvalids in any locality, here again sentiment and science are greatly\r\nat variance. An examination of the official records of the Signal\r\nService Bureau, and the statistics of the Smithsonian Institute, showed\r\nthat out of a list of forty cities on the continent Buffalo ranked\r\nhighest for equability of climate. Thus we quote from an editorial in\r\nthe _Advertiser_ of the same issue: \"While the aggregate of change for\r\nBuffalo stood at 67 for the year, that of Philadelphia reached 204,\r\nWashington was 224, Cincinnati 205, St. Louis 171. Winchester, in one of\r\nthe healthiest parts of Virginia, reached as high as 201. Aiken, in\r\nSouth Carolina, a famous resort for invalids, touched 220. St.\r\nAugustine, one of the lowest in the list, showed a much less equable\r\nclimate than that of Buffalo, being 94 to our 67.\" The transition from\r\nsummer to winter, and _vice versa_, is exceedingly gradual, and,\r\nconsequently, Buffalonians are seldom afflicted with those epidemic\r\ndiseases which generally appear in other localities during the spring\r\nand summer months. Thus the thermometric readings of the Signal Service\r\nBureau for 1873, show that the average temperature for July and August\r\nwas 74°. For September it was about 64°, which was again reduced by\r\nabout 10° for October. The monthly average for November was 73°, and for\r\nDecember 25°, which was also the average for January. Then the readings\r\nfor February showed an average of 26°, for March 32°, and 43° for April.\r\nA more equable and gradual transition from midsummer heat to midwinter\r\ncold cannot be shown by any locality on this continent. Seldom does the\r\nmercury rise above ninety during our warmest summers, or fall below zero\r\nin our most severe winters. In J. Disturnal's work, entitled \"The\r\nInfluence of Climate in North and South America,\" published by Van\r\nNostrand, in 1867, the climate of Buffalo is thus characterized: \"From\r\ncertain natural causes, no doubt produced by the waters of Lake Erie,\r\nthe winters are less severe, the summers less hot, the temperature night\r\nand day more equable, and the transition from heat to cold less rapid,\r\nin Buffalo than in any other locality within the temperate zone of the\r\nUnited States, as will be seen by the following table.\" The table\r\nreferred to shows that, \"during the summer months, the temperature of\r\nBuffalo is from 10° to 20° cooler than that of any other point east,\r\nsouth, or west of the ports on Lake Erie; while the refreshing and\r\ninvigorating lake breeze is felt night and day.\" The author further adds\r\nthat \"during the winter months the thermometer rarely indicates zero,\r\nand the mean temperature for January, 1858, was 20° above.\"\r\n\r\nA careful investigation into the comparative climatology of the several\r\ngreat social and commercial centers, proved _Buffalo to be superior to\r\nall others in the climatic requirements for the invalid_. Besides, it\r\nhas the important advantage of being a central point of traffic and\r\ntravel between the West and the East.\r\n\r\n\r\nADVANTAGES OF LOCATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second important consideration in projecting this home for invalids\r\nwas _location_. It has generally been customary to locate institutions\r\nof this character in rural districts, removed from the advantages of\r\ncity life, on the plea of escaping the confusion and excitement so\r\ndetrimental to recovery. The result is well known. Invalids have\r\nregarded them more as pleasure resorts than health resorts, spending the\r\nsummer months there, but fleeing to their homes at the fall of the first\r\nsnow-flake. The good that was done in the summer is undone by\r\ncarelessness and exposure in the winter. A location that would combine\r\nboth city advantages and rural pleasures, seemed to us, upon reflection,\r\nto be the desirable one. Fortunately, Buffalo afforded the happy mean.\r\nOur extensive parks, our unsurpassed facilities for yachting, fishing,\r\nand all aquatic sports, our many sylvan lake and river retreats, our\r\nworld-famed Niagara,--certainly a more desirable selection of rural\r\nscenes and pleasures cannot be found in another locality in America.\r\n\r\n\r\nA GENUINE HOME.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn erecting the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute, our paramount\r\ndesign was to make it a genuine home--_not a hospital_--a home where the\r\nchild of fortune would miss none of the comforts of her palatial home,\r\nwhile the poor man would find not only health but his pleasures\r\nmultiplied a thousand fold.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR TERMS MODERATE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wholesale merchant's prices are far less than those of the retail\r\ndealer. He can afford it, his sales are so much larger. It is on\r\nprecisely the same principle that we are able to make the rates at the\r\nInvalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute comparatively low. If we had only\r\na limited number of patients, we should be obliged to make the charges\r\ncommensurate with our expenses; but our practice having become very\r\nextensive, and the income being correspondingly large, we are enabled to\r\nmake the rates at the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute so moderate\r\nthat all who desire can avail themselves of its medical, surgical, and\r\nhygienic advantages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Prescription Department--Invalids' Hotel and Surgical\r\nInstitute.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFACILITIES FOR TREATMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the many advantages afforded by the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical\r\nInstitute, in treating disease, we can make only brief mention of a few\r\nof the more prominent.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIVISION OF LABOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the examination and treatment of patients, our practice is divided\r\ninto specialties. Each member of the Faculty, although educated to\r\npractice in _all_ departments of medicine and surgery, is here assigned\r\nto a special department only, to which he devotes his entire time, study\r\nand attention.\r\n\r\n\r\nADVANTAGES OF SPECIALTIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe division-of-labor system proves as effectual in the exercise of the\r\nprofessions as in manufactures. In the legal profession this has long\r\nbeen a recognized fact. One lawyer devotes his attention specially to\r\ncriminal law, and distinguishes himself in that department. Another\r\ndevelops a special faculty for unraveling knotty questions in matters of\r\nreal estate, and, if a title is to be proved, or a deed annulled, he is\r\nthe preferred counselor. In a certain manner, too, this has long been\r\npracticed by the medical profession. Thus some physicians (and we may\r\nadd physicians who call themselves \"regular,\" and are specially caustic\r\nin their denunciation of \"advertising doctors\") are accustomed to\r\ndistribute cards among their patrons, certifying that they give special\r\nattention to diseases of women and children. In this institution each\r\nphysician and surgeon is assigned a special department of medicine or\r\nsurgery. By constant study and attention to his department, each has\r\nbecome a skillful specialist, readily detecting every phase and\r\ncomplication of the diseases referred to him. Not only is superior skill\r\nthus attained, but also _rapidity_ and _accuracy_ in diagnosis.\r\n\r\nThoroughness and efficiency in any branch of learning can be secured\r\nonly by devoting to it special study and attention. When the faculty of\r\na university is to be chosen, how are its members selected? For\r\ninstance, how is the chair of astronomy filled? Do they choose the man\r\nwho is celebrated for his general scholastic attainments, or do they not\r\nrather confer it upon one who is known to have devoted special attention\r\nand study to the science of astronomy, and is, therefore, especially\r\nqualified to explain its theories and principles? Thus all the several\r\nchairs are filled by gentlemen whose general scholarship not only is\r\nknown to be of the highest standard, but who devote special attention to\r\nthe departments assigned them, thus becoming proficient specialists\r\ntherein. The same system of specialties is observed in the departments\r\nof a medical college. The professor who would assume to lecture in all\r\nthe departments with equal ease and proficiency would be severely\r\nridiculed by his colleagues; and yet it is just as absurd to suppose\r\nthat the general practitioner can keep himself informed of the many new\r\nmethods of treatment that are being constantly devised and adopted in\r\nthe several departments of medicine and surgery.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROGRESS IN MEDICINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn no other science is more rapid and real progress being made at the\r\npresent time than in that of medicine. Even the specialist must be\r\nstudious and earnest in his work to keep himself well and accurately\r\ninformed of the progress made in his department. Thus it so often\r\nhappens that the general practitioner pursues old methods of treatment\r\nwhich science has long since replaced with others, acknowledged to be\r\nsuperior. The specialist, on the contrary, by confining his studies and\r\nresearches to one class of diseases only, is enabled to inform himself\r\nthoroughly and accurately on all the improvements made in the methods\r\nand means of practice in his special department.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the practice of specialists and that of general\r\npractitioners is aptly illustrated by the difference between the\r\nold-fashioned district school, in which the school-master taught all the\r\nbranches, from a-b-abs to the solution of unknown quantities and the\r\ncharmed mysteries of philosophy, and the modern seminary, with its\r\nefficient corps of teachers, each devoting his or her whole attention to\r\nthe study and teaching of one special department of learning.\r\n\r\nWe attribute the success which has attended the practice at the\r\nInvalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute, in a great measure, to a wise\r\nadoption of this system of specialties.\r\n\r\n\r\nADVANTAGES OFFERED TO INVALIDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nObviously, the most important of these advantages is _facility of\r\ntreatment_. Of the thousands whom we have cured of chronic diseases, we\r\nhave probably not seen one in five hundred, having accomplished the\r\ndesired result through remedies sent either by mail or express, and\r\nadvice given by letter. Yet in some obstinate forms of disease, we can\r\nhere bring to bear remedial means not to be found or applied elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThat thousands of cases of chronic disease, pronounced incurable, have,\r\nby our rational and scientific treatment, been restored to perfect\r\nhealth, is conclusively proved by the records of practice at the\r\nInvalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute. Here, in obstinate cases, are\r\nbrought to bear all the most scientific remedial appliances and methods\r\nof treatment.\r\n\r\nA system of mechanical movements, passive exercises, manipulations,\r\nkneadings and rubbings, administered by a large variety of\r\ningeniously-contrived machinery, driven by stream-power, has been found\r\nespecially efficacious and valuable, as an aid to medical and surgical\r\ntreatment, in the cure of obstinate cases of nervous and sick headache,\r\nconstipation, paralysis, or palsy, stiffened joints, crooked and\r\nwithered limbs, spinal curvature, tumors, diseases of women, especially\r\ndisplacements of the uterus, or womb, such as prolapsus, retroversion\r\nand anteversion, chronic inflammation, enlargement and ulceration of the\r\nuterus, and kindred affections; also in nervous debility, sleeplessness,\r\nand other chronic diseases. Mechanical power, or force, is by these\r\nmachines transmitted to the system, in which it is transformed into\r\nvital energy and physical power or strength. This mechanical, passive\r\nexercise, or movement-cure treatment, differs widely from, and should\r\nnot be confounded with, \"Swedish movements,\" to which it is far superior\r\nin efficacy. Coupled with our improved and wonderful system of\r\n\"Vitalization\" treatment, it affords the most perfect system of physical\r\ntraining and development ever devised. For the restoration of power to\r\nwasted, undeveloped, or weakened organs or parts, for their enlargement,\r\nthis combined movement and \"Vitalization\" treatment is unequaled. It can\r\nbe applied to strengthen or enlarge any organ or part. We also employ\r\nboth Dynamic and Static electricity, \"Franklinism\" and Electrolysis, and\r\nchemical, Turkish and other baths, in all cases in which they are\r\nindicated. Inhalations, administered by means of the most approved\r\napparatus, are employed with advantage in many obstinate lung,\r\nbronchial, and throat affections. We have no hobby or one-idea system of\r\ntreatment, no good remedial means being overlooked or neglected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A glimpse of some\r\nof the rooms for the\r\napplication of Electricity,\r\nMechanical\r\nMassage, \"Vitalization\"\r\ntreatment, and\r\nother agencies prescribed by our Staff;\r\nfurnishing a perfect system of physical\r\nand remedial training, carefully adapted\r\nto the wants of the most delicate and feeble,\r\nas well as to the more robust.]\r\n\r\n\r\nA FAIR AND BUSINESS-LIKE OFFER TO THE AFFLICTED.\r\n\r\n\r\nReader, are you accustomed to think and act for yourself? Do you consult\r\nyour own reason and best interests? If so, then do not heed the counsel\r\nof skeptical and prejudiced friends, or jealous physicians, but listen\r\nto what we have to say.\r\n\r\nYou perhaps know nothing of us, or our systems of treatment, or of the\r\nbusiness methods we employ. You may _imagine_, but you _know nothing_,\r\nperhaps, of our facilities and advantages for performing cures in cases\r\nbeyond the reach or aid of the general practitioner. Knowing nothing,\r\nthen, of all these advantages, you still know as much as the would-be\r\nfriend or physician who never loses an opportunity to traduce and\r\nmisrepresent us, and prejudice the afflicted against us.\r\n\r\nNow to the point--are you listening? Then permit us to state that we\r\nhave the largest, the best, and the finest buildings of any like\r\nAssociation, company, or firm in this country. We employ _more_ and\r\n_better_ Medical and Surgical Specialists in our Invalids' Hotel and\r\nSurgical Institute than any similar Association, company, or individual,\r\nand actually have more capital invested. We have a thoroughly qualified\r\nand eminent Specialist for every disease that we treat. We treat more\r\ncases, _and absolutely cure more patients_ than any similar institution\r\nin America. In addition to those we treat medically, we perform all the\r\nmost difficult surgical operations known to the most eminent Surgeons,\r\nand so frequently do many of these operations occur with us that some of\r\nour Specialists have become the most expert and skillful Surgeons on\r\nthis continent.\r\n\r\nWe wish to add further that we are responsible to _you_ for what we\r\nrepresent; we therefore ask you to come and visit our institutions; and,\r\nif you find on investigation that we have misstated or misrepresented\r\n_in any particular_ our institutions, our advantages, or our success in\r\ncuring Chronic Diseases, _we will gladly and promptly refund to you all\r\nthe expenses of your trip_. We court honest, sincere investigation, and\r\nare glad and anxious to show interested people what we can do and are\r\ndaily doing for suffering humanity. Can a proposition be plainer? Can an\r\noffer be more fair and business-like? If, therefore, you are afflicted,\r\nand are seeking relief, come where genuine ability is a ruling feature,\r\nwhere _success_ is our watchword and the alleviation of human suffering\r\nour mission.\r\n\r\nWhether arriving in our city by day or night, _come directly to the\r\nInvalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute, 663 Main Street_, where you will\r\nbe hospitably received and well cared for.\r\n\r\nAddress all correspondence to\r\n\r\n    WORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION,\r\n    _663 Main Street, BUFFALO, N.Y._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUCCESSFUL TREATMENT OF CHRONIC OR LINGERING DISEASES.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFor many years the founder of the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute\r\nand World's Dispensary has devoted himself very closely to the\r\ninvestigation and treatment of chronic diseases. Some few specifics\r\nhave, during this time, been developed for certain forms of chronic\r\nailments, and given to the public, but they have not been lauded as\r\n\"cure-alls,\" or panaceas, but only recommended as remedies for certain\r\nwell-defined and easily recognized forms of disease. These medicines are\r\nsold through druggists very largely, and have earned great celebrity for\r\ntheir many cures. So far from claiming that these proprietary medicines\r\nwill cure all diseases, their manufacturers advise the afflicted that,\r\nin many complicated and delicate chronic affections, they are not\r\nsufficient to meet the wants of the case. These must have special\r\nconsideration and treatment by a competent physician and surgeon, the\r\nmedicines and other remedial means required being selected and prepared\r\nwith reference to each particular case.\r\n\r\nIn order to be able to offer those afflicted with chronic ailments the\r\nmost skillful medical and surgical services, Dr. Pierce, many years ago,\r\nassociated with himself several eminent physicians and surgeons, as the\r\nFaculty of the old and renowned World's Dispensary, the consulting\r\nDepartment of which is now merged with the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical\r\nInstitute.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIVISION OF LABOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the organization of the medical and surgical staff of the Invalids'\r\nHotel and Surgical Institute, several years ago, we assigned to one\r\nphysician the examination and treatment of diseases of the nervous\r\nsystem; to another, surgical operations and the treatment of surgical\r\ndiseases; a third had charge of catarrhal and pulmonary diseases and\r\naffections of the heart; a fourth attended to diseases peculiar to\r\nwomen; a fifth, to diseases of the eye and ear; a sixth, to diseases of\r\nthe digestive organs; a seventh, to special surgical cases; to another\r\nwe entrusted diseases of the urogenital organs; and to others, various\r\nother specialties. Now that our practice has become so very extensive as\r\nto require for its conduct a greatly increased number of physicians and\r\nsurgeons. Thus four physicians and surgeons devote their undivided\r\nattention to the examination and treatment of diseases of the urinary\r\nand generative organs of men. Three physicians give their sole attention\r\nto diseases peculiar to women and three to those of the nasal organs,\r\nthroat and chest, embracing all chronic diseases of the respiratory\r\norgans. Thus we have a full council of three and four physicians in\r\nthese several specialties. In several other divisions we have two\r\nspecialists. No case is slighted either in the examination or in the\r\ntreatment. All doubtful, obscure or difficult cases are submitted to a\r\ncouncil composed of several physicians and surgeons. Skilled\r\npharmaceutists are employed to compound the medicines prescribed. For\r\nthe purpose of enabling us to conduct our extensive correspondence (for\r\nwe have an extensive practice en every part of the United States and\r\nCanada, as well as in Great Britain from our London branch),\r\ngraphophones are employed, to which replies are dictated, recording the\r\nwords of the speaker. Afterwards the letters are written out in full,\r\ngenerally on a type-writing machine, which prints them in a plain,\r\nlegible style. These machines are operated as rapidly as a person can\r\nthink of the letters which compose a word, each operator thus\r\naccomplishing the work of several copyists. This system, by which we are\r\nenabled to correspond with our patients as rapidly as we can talk, has\r\nbeen rendered necessary by the growth of our business, which has\r\nattained immense proportions, giving rise to so large a correspondence\r\nthat a dozen physicians cannot possibly conduct it all and give each\r\npatient's case careful attention, without the employment of graphophones\r\nand all other facilities which modern invention has given us. By the\r\nadoption of these various means, we are enabled to fully meet the\r\ndemands of the afflicted, and give every case the most careful\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Faculty of Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute in\r\nSession.--Council-room.]\r\n\r\nAs many persons, particularly young ladies and gentlemen, having catarrh\r\nor almost any other chronic disease, especially if of the urogenital\r\norgans, are very sensitive and fearful that somebody will know that they\r\nare afflicted and employing medical treatment, precautions are taken\r\nthat none who consult us may incur the least risk of exposure. Although\r\nnone but the most honorable and trustworthy gentlemen are employed as\r\nassistants, yet as a _guarantee_ of perfect security to our patients,\r\nthat every communication, whether made in person or by letter, will be\r\ntreated as _sacredly confidential_, each professional associate, clerk,\r\nor assistant, is required to take a solemn oath of secrecy. Great care\r\nis also taken to send all letters and medicines carefully sealed in\r\nplain envelopes and packages, so that no one can even _suspect_ the\r\ncontents or by whom they are sent.\r\n\r\n\r\nADVANTAGES OF SPECIALTIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy thorough organization and a perfect system of subdividing the\r\npractice of medicine and surgery in this institution, every invalid\r\nconsulting us is treated by a specialist--one who devotes his undivided\r\nattention to the particular class of diseases to which his or her case\r\nbelongs. The advantage of this arrangement must be obvious. Medical\r\nscience offers a vast field for investigation, and no physician can,\r\nwithin the limit of a single life-time, achieve the highest degree of\r\nsuccess in the treatment of _every_ malady incident to humanity. A\r\ndistinguished professor in the medical department of one of our\r\nuniversities, in an address to the graduating class, recently said:\r\n\"Some professional men seem to be ashamed unless they have the character\r\nof universal knowledge. He who falls into the error of studying\r\neverything will be certain to know nothing well. Every man must have a\r\ngood foundation. He must, in the first place, be a good general\r\npractitioner. But the field has become too large to be cultivated in its\r\nentirety by any individual; hence the advantage of cultivating special\r\nstudies in large towns, which admit of the subdivision of professional\r\npursuits. It is no longer possible to know everything; something must\r\nbe wisely left unknown. Indeed, a physician, if he would know anything\r\nwell must be content to be profoundly ignorant of many things. He must\r\nselect something for special study, and pursue it with devotion and\r\ndiligence. This course will lead to success, while the attempt to do\r\neverything eventuates unavoidably in failure. Let there be single hands\r\nfor special duties.\" Our institution is the only one in this country in\r\nwhich these common-sense-ideas are _thoroughly_ carried out. The\r\ndiversified tastes and talents of physicians cause each to excel in\r\ntreating some one class of diseases, to which he devotes more attention\r\nand study than to others. One medical student manifests great interest\r\nin the anatomy, physiology, pathology, and treatment of diseases of the\r\neye. He becomes thoroughly familiar with all the minutest details\r\nrelative to that organ and its diseases, and so thoroughly qualifies\r\nhimself in this branch of knowledge that he is able to cure an\r\ninflammation or other affection of the eye in a very short time. Another\r\nstudent is more interested in some other class of diseases, for the\r\nstudy of which he has a liking, and neglects to inform himself in the\r\nophthalmic branch of medical and surgical science. If after engaging in\r\nthe practice of his chosen profession, he is consulted by persons\r\nsuffering from diseases of the eye, he tortures them with unnecessary\r\nand oftimes injurious applications, clumsily and carelessly made, and,\r\nas the result of such unskillful treatment, the inestimable blessing of\r\nsight may be sacrificed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Corner in Printing Department.--World's Dispensary.]\r\n\r\nThe great majority of physicians allow acute maladies, diseases of\r\nchildren, and the practice of midwifery, to engross most of their time\r\nand attention. They manifest an absorbing interest in everything that\r\nrelates to these subjects, and devote little or no time to acquiring an\r\nintimate knowledge of the great variety of chronic maladies which\r\nafflict mankind. They acquire skill and reputation in their favorite\r\nline of practice, but are annoyed if consulted by one suffering from\r\nsome obscure chronic affection, usually turn the invalid off with a very\r\nsuperficial examination, and, perhaps, only prescribe some placebo,[6]\r\napparently indifferent as to the result, but really desiring thus to\r\nconceal their lack of familiarity with such diseases. The specialist,\r\nthe treatment of chronic diseases being his vocation, is equally annoyed\r\nif consulted by those suffering from acute diseases, but does not pursue\r\nthe inconsistent course of assuming to treat them. He refers them to\r\nthose of his medical brethren whose daily dealings with such cases make\r\nthem, in his way of thinking, more competent than himself to render\r\nvaluable service to such sufferers. He recognizes the fact that no man\r\nis likely to succeed in any line of study or business for which he\r\npossesses no talent or relish, nor does he believe in being a\r\n\"jack-at-all-trades and master of none.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nADVERTISING.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving thoroughly qualified himself for the practice of some particular\r\nbranch of the healing art, the specialist sees no impropriety in\r\nacquainting the public with his ability to relieve certain forms of\r\nsuffering. He believes that medical men should possess equal rights with\r\nother business men, and that any code of medical ethics which would\r\ndeprive him of any of the sacred rights guaranteed to all by the liberal\r\nlaws of the country, is professional _tyranny_, and merits only his\r\ncontemptuous disregard. Nor does he display any false modesty in the\r\n_manner_ of making known his skill. He maintains that he has an\r\nundoubted right to place his claim to patronage before the public by\r\nevery fair and honorable means. He recognizes the display of goods in\r\nthe merchant's show-windows as no less an advertisement and in no better\r\ntaste than the publication of a card in the newspaper. So, likewise, he\r\nregards the various devices by which the extremely _ethical_ physician\r\nseeks to place himself conspicuously before the public, as but so many\r\nways of advertising, and as not more modest than the publication of\r\ncures actually performed, or than his announcement through the public\r\npress of his professional resources for treating certain maladies.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe physician who expresses a \"holy horror\" of the \"_advertising\r\ndoctor_,\" liberally bestowing upon him the epithet of \"quack,\" announces\r\n_himself_ a graduate, talks learnedly and gives notice to the public in\r\n_some_ way that he is ready to serve them. He endeavors to impress upon\r\nthe mind of the patient and family his skill, frequently exaggerates as\r\nto the extent of his practice, rides furiously about when he has no\r\nprofessional calls, keeps up business appearances by driving several\r\nhorses, or joins influential societies. He may make a great display in\r\nstyle, manner, dress, pretensions, writing for the newspapers,\r\nexhibiting literary pedantry, referring to the superior facilities\r\nafforded by some particular school or society to which he belongs; or by\r\nediting and publishing a medical journal, ostensibly for the advancement\r\nof medical science, but practically to display titles or professorships,\r\nto publish reports which flatteringly allude to cases he has treated,\r\nthe number of capital surgical operations he has performed, or the\r\ndistinguished families he is treating. All these are but _modes of\r\nadvertising_ professional wares; in short, are artful, though not\r\nrefined, tricks, resorted to for private announcement. We say to all\r\nsuch adventurers in modern advertising diplomacy, that these indirect,\r\nclandestine methods are not half so candid and honorable as a direct\r\npublic statement of the intentions and proposals of a medical\r\npractitioner, who thereby incurs an individual responsibility before the\r\nlaw and his fellow-men.\r\n\r\nNo good reason has ever been assigned why any well educated physician,\r\ntrained in the school of experience until he becomes proficient in\r\nmedical skill, may not publish facts and evidence to disclose it,\r\nespecially when these are abundant and conclusive. The following\r\nextracts from an able article by the Rev. THOMAS K. BEECHER embodies a\r\nsound view of the subject of medical advertising. He says:\r\n\r\n* * \"I am glad that the doctor cured him; I am glad that the doctor put\r\nit in the paper that he could cure him. And if any doctor is certain\r\nthat he can cure such diseases and don't put it in the paper, I am\r\nsorry. What a pity it would have been had this doctor come to town with\r\nhis wealth of science and experience and gone away leaving him uncured!\r\nWhat a pity it would have been if he had been so prejudiced against\r\nadvertising as to read the responsible certificate of the doctor and\r\ngive him the go-by as a quack! What are newspapers for, if not to\r\ncirculate information? What more valuable information can a newspaper\r\ngive than to tell a sick man where he can be cured? If a man has devoted\r\nhis life and labor to the study of a special class of diseases, the\r\nnecessity of his saying so becomes all the more pressing. His _duty_ to\r\nadvertise becomes imperative.\r\n\r\n\"When I was in England, I found on all the dead walls of London,\r\nplacards, declaring that Dean Stanley, Chaplain to the Prince of Wales,\r\nwould preach at such a place; that his grace the Archbishop (I think) of\r\nCanterbury would preach at another time and place; again, that an Oxford\r\nprofessor would preach. In short, religious notices were sprinkled in\r\namong the theater bills, and the highest church dignitaries were\r\nadvertised side by side with actors, singers, and clowns. Of course, I\r\nwas shocked by it, but in a moment I bethought me--if it be all right\r\nand dignified to hire a sexton to ring a bell when the minister is going\r\nto preach, it is all the same to silence the bell and hire a\r\nbill-sticker to tell the same news, the essential thing being to tell\r\nthe truth every time. The remedy for the lying advertisements is for\r\nhonest men to tell the truth. 'When iniquity cometh in like a flood,\r\nthen the spirit of the Lord lifts up the standard.' A really able man,\r\nwhatever be his gifts, makes a great mistake if he fail to use those\r\ngifts through want of advertising.\"\r\n\r\nIf a physician possesses knowledge that enables him to remedy diseases\r\nheretofore regarded as incurable, what virtue or modesty is there to\r\n\"hide his light under a bushel\"? In this free country the people think\r\nand act for themselves, and hence all have a deep concern in the subject\r\nof health. The strong popular prejudice against the doctors who\r\nadvertise is due to the fact, that by this method so many ignorant\r\ncharlatans are enabled to palm off their worthless services upon the\r\nuneducated and credulous; but the practice of such imposition should not\r\ncause a presumption against the public announcement of real skill, for\r\nthe baser metal bears conclusive evidence that the pure also exists.\r\n\r\nEvery step in scientific investigation, every proposition which relates\r\nto the interest and happiness of man, every statement and appeal\r\ninvolving a valuable consideration, must be submitted to the scrutiny\r\nand judgment of individual reason; for every person has the right to\r\nform his own conclusions, and justify them by experience. Those claims\r\nwhich are only supported by empty assertion are very doubtful. Misty\r\ntheories vanish before the sun of truth. He who renders professional\r\nservices cannot be successful, unless he be sustained by real merit.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATING PATIENTS WHO RESIDE AT A DISTANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can treat many chronic diseases as successfully without as with a\r\npersonal consultation, as our vast experience enables us to correctly\r\ndetermine the malady from which the patient is suffering, from a history\r\nof the symptoms, and answers to questions furnished. We have not seen\r\none person in five hundred of those whom we have cured.\r\n\r\nSome may suppose that a physician cannot obtain, through correspondence,\r\na sufficiently accurate idea of the condition of a patient to enable him\r\nto treat the case successfully; but a large experience in this practice\r\nhas proved the contrary to be true, for some of the most remarkable\r\ncures have been effected through the medium of correspondence. In most\r\nlong-continued cases, the patient has thought over his symptoms hundreds\r\nof times. The location of every pain, whether acute or mild, constant or\r\noccasional, and the circumstances under which it occurs, have been\r\ncarefully noted. He has observed whether he had a rush of blood to the\r\nhead, was feverish or chilly, whether troubled with cold hands and feet,\r\nwhether full of blood, or pale and bloodless; and he states these\r\nmatters with accuracy and common sense when writing to us, for he has a\r\nvery good, if not a professional, knowledge of the relative importance\r\nof these symptoms. So in regard to digestion, he states what kinds of\r\nfood agree with him, or whether he is troubled with excessive acidity or\r\na flatulent condition of the stomach. He also informs us whether his\r\ntongue is coated and bilious, or clean and healthy, and gives many other\r\nparticulars too various to enumerate, by which we are enabled to gain a\r\nperfect understanding of the case. If his description be not\r\nsufficiently complete to enable us to obtain a definite understanding of\r\nthe case, he is requested to answer a list of important questions which\r\nare sent him. The people are far more intelligent in these matters than\r\nphysicians are generally willing to admit. A patient is often confused\r\nwhile being personally examined by a physician, and gives imperfect or\r\nincorrect answers. After he has left the presence of the physician, he\r\nfinds that he has failed to enumerate many of the most important\r\nsymptoms. In consulting by letter, the patient is not embarrassed, he\r\nstates the exact symptoms, and carefully reads over the letter to see if\r\nit is a complete and accurate description of his sufferings. In this way\r\nhe conveys a much better idea of the case than if present in person, and\r\nsubjected to the most thorough questioning and cross-examination. The\r\ntimid lady and nervous young man write just as they feel; and one\r\nimportant reason why we have had such superior success in treating\r\nintricate and delicate diseases, is because we have obtained such true\r\nand natural statements of the cases from these letters, many of which\r\nare perfect pen-pictures of disease. As bank-tellers and cashiers, who\r\ndaily handle large quantities of currency, can infallibly detect\r\nspurious money by a glance at the engraving or a touch of the paper, so\r\nthe experienced physician, by his great familiarity with disease,\r\nbecomes equally skilled in detecting the nature and extent of a chronic\r\nmalady from a written description of its symptoms.\r\n\r\n\r\nURINARY SIGNS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA careful microscopical examination and chemical analysis of the urine\r\nis a valuable aid in determining the nature of many chronic diseases,\r\nparticularly those of the nervous system, blood, liver, kidneys,\r\nbladder, prostate gland and generative organs. This important fact is\r\nnot overlooked at the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute, where an\r\nexperienced chemist is employed to make such examinations and report the\r\nresult to the attending physicians. Medical authors, professors, and\r\npractitioners of all schools, admit and even insist upon the importance\r\nof such examinations in diagnosticating diseases. Many practitioners\r\nneglect to take advantage of this invaluable aid, while others fear that\r\nif they attach much importance to such examinations they will be ranked\r\nwith \"uroscopian\" or \"water\" doctors, a class of enthusiasts who claim\r\nto be able to correctly diagnosticate every disease by an examination of\r\nthe urine. Persons consulting us and wishing to avail themselves of the\r\nadvantages afforded by these examinations can send small vials of their\r\nurine by express. The vials should be carefully packed in saw-dust or\r\npaper and enclosed in a light wooden box. All charges for transportation\r\nmust be prepaid, and a complete history of the case including the age\r\nand sex of the patient, must accompany each package, or it will receive\r\nno attention. This saves valuable time by directing the examination into\r\nthe channels indicated, thus avoiding a lengthy series of experiments.\r\nAs we are daily receiving numerous vials of urine, every sample should,\r\nto prevent confusion, be labeled with the patient's name.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Binocular Microscope used at the Invalids' Hotel and\r\nSurgical Institute.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\nThere is a natural, definite proportion of the component elements of\r\nevery solid and fluid of the human body. These proportions have been\r\nreduced to definite standards, a deviation from which affords evidence\r\nof disease. Thus, there being a fixed standard in a normal proportion of\r\nthe elements of the blood, any deviation from it, as in anæmia,\r\nleucocythæmia, etc., indicates disease. So also the standard proportion\r\nof the urinary elements being known, any considerable change, either in\r\nquantity or quality of its parts, bears unmistakable evidence of\r\ndisease. The invention of the microscope has provided increased\r\nfacilities for detecting diseases by examination of the urine. By the\r\naid of this wonderful instrument, we are enabled to discover with\r\nabsolute certainty the various urinary deposits characteristic of\r\ndifferent maladies; thus in Fig. 1, A represents in a general way the\r\nsediment of abnormal urine as seen under the microscope. In division B\r\nis represented oxalate of urea upon precipitation by oxalic acid.\r\nNitrate of urea is represented in division C. A deficiency of urea in\r\nthe urine, with albumen and casts present, is a most important guide in\r\nthe diagnosis of Bright's disease. The average quantity of urea present\r\nduring health is 21.57 parts in 1,000. The microscopic examination of\r\nthe urine, notwithstanding the distaste, and even contempt, which many\r\nphysicians manifest for such investigations, is pursued at the Invalids'\r\nHotel and Surgical Institute, with inestimable benefit to our patients.\r\nIt has revealed the existence of many serious affections, which, with\r\nall our other modes of investigation, we might have been unable to\r\ndetect. It has also thrown light upon many obscure chronic diseases.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\nWe have already spoken of the marked changes effected in the urine by a\r\nderangement of the digestive functions. It is a matter of surprise that\r\nphysicians generally pay so little attention to the urine when dyspepsia\r\nis suspected, since all admit that an examination of that excretion\r\nfurnishes unmistakable evidence of the nature and complications of the\r\ndisease. In this way we are many times enabled to determine whether the\r\nindigestion is caused by congestion or functional disease of the liver\r\nor kidneys or by nervous debility. And when such cases are treated in\r\naccordance with the indications furnished, increased success attends our\r\npractice. In Fig. 2 highly magnified urinary deposits, which indicate\r\nimpairment of the digestive functions, are represented. The crystals are\r\ncomposed of oxalate of lime and appear in the different forms shown in\r\nthe five sections, of octahedral, decahedral, round and dumb bell\r\nshapes. The latter are formed in the kidneys, and are sometimes\r\ndiscovered adhering to casts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.]\r\n\r\n\r\nINVALUABLE AIDS IN DETERMINING DISEASES OF THE KIDNEYS AND BLADDER.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.]\r\n\r\nThe various forms of gravel, Bright's disease of the kidneys,\r\nhæmaturia, inflammation of the kidneys and bladder, diabetes, and other\r\nfunctional and organic diseases of the urinary organs effect\r\ncharacteristic changes in the urine, thus enabling us to distinguish\r\nthem with certainty and exactness. Some of the various microscopical\r\nappearances of the urinary deposits in diseases of the kidneys and\r\nbladder, are represented in Fig. 3. In division A is represented pus and\r\nmucus, with decomposition, indicating suppuration somewhere along the\r\nurinary tract. In B pus globules are alone represented. In the division\r\nmarked C are shown blood corpuscles as they are arranged in blood drawn\r\nfrom a vein or artery. D represents the same separated, as they always\r\nare when present in the urine. In E highly magnified oil globules are\r\nrepresented. If present in the urine, they indicate disease of the\r\nkidneys. In F are represented epithelial cells, the presence of which in\r\nlarge numbers is indicative of diseases of the mucous lining of the\r\nurinary organs.\r\n\r\nFig. 4 represents the microscopic appearance of phosphates in the\r\nurine. These are present in great quantity in cases of nervous debility\r\nand kindred affections. By attaching the _camera lucida_ to the\r\nmicroscope we can throw an image of these urinary deposits upon paper.\r\nBy the art of the engraver this may be faithfully traced, and thus we\r\nare enabled to produce an accurate representation of them. Some of the\r\nbeautiful crystalline deposits shown in Fig. 4 represent less than a\r\nmillionth part of a grain, yet their forms are delineated with\r\ngeometrical precision. Earthy phosphates are often mistaken for pus and\r\nalso seminal fluid. Phosphates are always found in decomposed urine,\r\notherwise they indicate brain affections, acute cystitis, etc.\r\nExperience has taught us that the voiding of urine loaded with\r\nphosphates is a forerunner of cystitis, or enlargement of the prostate\r\ngland, or both. In fact, persons so affected are \"prone to serious\r\nconsequences from mild attacks of almost any and every acute disease.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.]\r\n\r\nFig. 5 represents the microscopic appearance of mixed urinary deposits.\r\nIn division A is represented fermentation spores as they appear in\r\ndiabetic urine. Pasteur asserts that the germs of this fungus get into\r\nthe urine after it has been passed. Urates appear in division B. These\r\nindicate waste of flesh, as in fevers, consumption, prolonged physical\r\nefforts, etc. Division C pictures urates of ammonia. These appear in\r\nalkaline decomposition of the urine; it is isomeric with uric acid in\r\nacid urine. In division D is represented urate of soda, which is present\r\nin the tissues of persons suffering from gout. The crystals shown in\r\ndivision E consist of the same salt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 6, division A, is represented purulent matter as it appears in\r\nthe urine. The formation of pus in different parts of the genitourinary\r\nsystem is accompanied by the appearance of pus corpuscles in the urine.\r\nWhen fat globules, represented in division B, are found in the urine,\r\nthey indicate fatty degeneration. In division C are representations of\r\nthe cells found in the urine of persons suffering from cystitis or other\r\ninflammatory diseases.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.]\r\n\r\nFig. 7, divisions A and B, represent different forms of cystine.\r\nFortunately this substance is rarely found in the urine. When present\r\nhowever it indicates liability to, or the actual presence of, a calculus\r\nor stone in the bladder. In division C is a representation of the\r\ndeposits seen in the urine of those who are greatly debilitated. In\r\ndivision D are seen epithelial cells mixed with mucus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 8, division A, are represented the caudated cells from the deep\r\nstructure of the bladder. The cells represented in division B are\r\namyloid concretions, found where there is an enlarged prostate gland.\r\n\r\nFig. 9 represents the appearance of spermatozoa as seen in the urine.\r\nWhen present, they afford indisputable evidence of the escape of semen\r\nin the renal excretions.\r\n\r\nWe might add many other illustrations of urinary deposits and state\r\ntheir several indications, but a sufficient number has been introduced\r\nto show the importance and practical value of microscopic examinations\r\nof the urine in revealing obscure diseases.\r\n\r\nAlthough the microscope is of inestimable value in examining the renal\r\nexcretion, it does not entirely supersede other valuable instruments and\r\nchemical re-agents in determining constitutional changes. By the\r\nurinometer we determine the specific gravity of the urine; by the use of\r\nlitmus its acid or alkaline reaction, is ascertained; while various\r\nchemicals, when added to it, produce certain specific changes, according\r\nto the morbid alterations which it has undergone by reason of disease.\r\nBy the application of heat, or the addition of a few drops of nitric\r\nacid, the albumen, which is invariably present in Bright's disease of\r\nthe kidneys, is coagulated. By the employment of other re-agents we may\r\ndetermine the presence of sugar--a characteristic of diabetic urine. And\r\nthus we might mention almost innumerable chemical tests by which the\r\nseveral changed conditions of the urine, _characteristic_ of different\r\ndiseases, may be ascertained with _absolute certainty_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MOST EMINENT MEDICAL AUTHORITIES ENDORSE IT.\r\n\r\nDr. Eberle, a distinguished allopathic author, thus writes: \"Whatever\r\nmay be the disease, the urine seldom fails in furnishing us with a clue\r\nto the principles upon which it is to be treated.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Braithwaite also says: \"We can arrive at a more accurate knowledge\r\nrespecting the nature of diseases from examining the urine than from any\r\nother symptom.\"\r\n\r\nGolding Bird, whose writings are regarded as sound and practical by the\r\nmost learned of the medical profession, says: \"The examination of the\r\nurine in disease is now regarded as one of the most important aids in\r\ndiagnosis, and which it would be injurious alike to the welfare of the\r\npatient and the credit of the practitioner to avoid.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.]\r\n\r\nThe eminent Dr. F. Simon writes as follows: \"From the physical and\r\nchemical state of the urine, the attentive and observing physician may\r\nobtain a great quantity of information for ascertaining and establishing\r\na diagnosis. More than all other signs, the correct examination of the\r\nsediment is of importance to the physician. * * * For the medical man it\r\nis the compass which guides him in the unlimited chaos of disease and\r\nits treatment; for the patient it is the thermometer of his condition,\r\nthe premonitory indication of the decrease or aggravation of his malady;\r\nand for the healthy man it is the regulator of his diet and his life.\r\nEvery one is aware of the variations of the barometer, and we know that\r\nthe fluctuations of the column of mercury are closely associated with\r\nthe variable conditions of the atmosphere; so, to the practical\r\nobserver, variations of the urine, as well as the elements composing it,\r\npoint out with certainty the changes in health, and the condition of the\r\norgans.\"\r\n\r\nWhile we recognize the importance of examining the urine as an aid in\r\ndistinguishing diseases, and have made this old German method of\r\ndiagnosis a special study, yet we do not claim that _all_ diseases can\r\nbe unmistakably distinguished by such examinations _alone_. We take a\r\nconservative position and have no confidence in that class of ignorant\r\nfanatics whose pet hobby is \"uroscopy.\"\r\n\r\nFrom every person who solicits our professional services, we require\r\nexplicit answers to numerous important questions, that we may know the\r\nage, sex, vocation, etc., as well as the prominent symptoms manifested.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSULTATIONS BY LETTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormerly, we published in this book a very extensive list of questions\r\nto be answered by those consulting us, but a large experience has\r\nconvinced us that beyond requiring answers to a few leading questions,\r\nwhich we still retain, it is better to let the patient describe the\r\nmalady in his or her own way and language. After receiving and\r\nconsidering such a history, if we do not fully understand the patient's\r\nmalady, we will ask such further questions as may be necessary. The\r\npatient should, however, in addition to writing name, post-office,\r\ncounty, and state, _plainly_, state the name of the town containing the\r\nnearest express office. Next give age, sex, whether married or single,\r\ncomplexion, height, present and former weight, if known, and occupation.\r\nState also if you have been a hard worker, and whether it is necessary\r\nfor you to labor hard now, how long you have been out of health, and\r\nfrom what particular symptoms you suffer most. Follow this with a\r\nhistory of your case in your own language. If you find in this volume an\r\naccurate description of your disease, state the page and paragraph where\r\nit occurs.\r\n\r\n\r\nFREE CONSULTATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe now make no charge for consultation by letter, but, instead of the\r\none dollar formerly charged by us as a consultation fee, as we are\r\ndesirous of making our facilities for treatment known to invalids far\r\nand near, we request that all persons writing to us for advice send us\r\nthe names of all those within the circle of their acquaintance who are\r\nin any way in need of medical or surgical treatment for chronic\r\ndiseases. If convenient, send the list on a separate piece of paper.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARGES MUST BE PREPAID.\r\n\r\n\r\nShould you send a vial of urine for analysis, about a cupful will do,\r\nand _all express charges on it must be prepaid_. All liquids are\r\nexcluded from the mails, when discovered, and yet we have received\r\nhundreds of samples through the mails safely when put in homoeopathic or\r\nother _very small_ vials, well corked and carefully packed in a light\r\ntin can or _wooden_ box, or in a light pine stick bored out hollow, the\r\nvial being carefully packed in sufficient saw-dust or blotting paper to\r\nabsorb all liquid should the vial get broken. Letter postage, that is,\r\ntwo cents for each one ounce or fraction thereof, must be paid upon\r\nthese sealed packages. Send the first urine that is passed after rising\r\nin the morning.\r\n\r\n\r\nRELIABLE MEDICINES.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext in importance to a correct understanding of the patient's disease,\r\nis the possession of reliable remedies for its treatment. Many of the\r\nmedicines employed by physicians engaged in general practice are\r\nprepared from old drugs that have lost all their medicinal virtues, and\r\nhence are utterly useless and ineffectual. Many vegetable extracts are\r\ninert, because the plants from which they are produced were not gathered\r\nat the proper time. To give the reader an idea of the great care which\r\nwe exercise in the selection and preparation of our medicines, he is\r\nrequested to read under the head of \"The Preparation of Medicines,\" in\r\n\"The People's Common Sense Medical Adviser.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR TERMS FOR TREATMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nrequire the payment of monthly fees, in advance, which entitles the\r\npatient to medicines specially prepared for and adapted to his or her\r\nparticular case, and to all necessary attention and advice. Our fees for\r\ntreatment are moderate, varying according to the nature and requirements\r\nof each particular case, and will be made known at the time of\r\nconsultation.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY OUR FEES ARE REQUIRED IN ADVANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe receive applications from strangers residing in all parts of America,\r\nand even in foreign countries, and it is not reasonable to suppose that\r\ncredit could be dispensed so indiscriminately. It would not be a correct\r\nbusiness transaction for a merchant to send a barrel of sugar or a roll\r\nof cloth to a stranger living hundreds of miles away, to be paid for\r\nwhen used. Our knowledge and medicines constitute our capital in\r\nbusiness, and an order upon that capital should be accompanied with an\r\nequivalent. Some applicants refer us to their neighbors for a\r\ntestimonial of their integrity. We cannot spare the time or employ\r\nassistants to make such inquiries for the sake of trusting any one.\r\nShould credit be thus indiscriminately given, there would necessarily be\r\nlosses, and, to compensate for these, and the extra expense incurred by\r\nthe employment of assistants, our fees would have to be much larger,\r\nthereby imposing the burden upon those who _do_ pay. Instead of\r\nfollowing this method of procedure, we place professional services\r\nwithin the reach of all, so that a greater number may be benefited. Many\r\ninvalids say that they have paid large sums of money to medical men for\r\ntreatment without obtaining relief. Unfortunately our land is cursed\r\nwith quacks and unprincipled practitioners, who seek no one's good but\r\ntheir own, and it is a defect in our law that it permits such swindlers\r\nto go unpunished. Not so reprehensible is the family physician who\r\nfails, because his limited and varied practice does not permit him to\r\nbecome proficient in treating chronic diseases.\r\n\r\nThe following beautiful sentiment of Hood truthfully expresses the\r\nsacredness of the physician's trust:\r\n\r\n        \"Above all price of wealth\r\n    The body's jewel. Not for minds or hands profane\r\n    To tamper with in practice vain.\r\n    Like to a woman's virtue is man's health;\r\n    A heavenly gift within a holy shrine!\r\n    To be approached and touched with serious fear,\r\n    By hands made pure and hearts of faith severe,\r\n    E'en as the priesthood of the One Divine.\"\r\n\r\nWe are in regular practice, responsible for what we say and do, and\r\ncordially invite those who desire further evidence of our success in\r\ncuring chronic diseases to come to the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical\r\nInstitute and satisfy themselves of the truthfulness of our statements.\r\n\r\nWe are warranted in saying that our responsibility and disposition for\r\nfair dealing are known to many of the principal mercantile houses, as\r\nwell as to all prominent American editors. We also refer to our present\r\nand former patients, one or more of whom may be found in almost every\r\nhamlet of America. To all who are under our treatment we devote our\r\nhighest energies and skill, fully realizing that an untold blessing is\r\nconferred upon every person whom we cure, and that such cures insure the\r\npermanency of our business. On the contrary, we realize how unfortunate\r\nit is for us to fail in restoring to health any person whom we have\r\nencouraged to hope for relief. We are careful, therefore, not to assume\r\nthe treatment of incurable cases, except when desired to do so for the\r\npurpose of mitigating suffering or prolonging life; for we never wish to\r\nencourage false hopes of recovery.\r\n\r\n\r\nTERMS FOR BOARD AND TREATMENT AT THE INVALIDS' HOTEL AND SURGICAL\r\nINSTITUTE\r\n\r\nare moderate, varying with the nature of the case and the apartments\r\noccupied. At times so great is the number applying to avail themselves\r\nof the skill of our Faculty, and the advantages which our institution\r\naffords, that we are unable to receive all applicants. To be sure of\r\nsecuring good apartments, it is well to engage them sometime ahead, and\r\nmake an advance payment of fifty dollars or more upon them, which will\r\nbe refunded in case acute sickness or any similar cause should prevent\r\nthe patient from occupying them at the time specified. Complete terms\r\nfor treatment and board can be arranged only when personal application\r\nfor entrance to the institution is made, and the nature and extent of\r\nthe disease and the necessary treatment fully determined by personal\r\nexamination of the case. If satisfactory terms and arrangements cannot\r\nat that time be agreed upon, or if the case be deemed incurable, any\r\nadvance payments that have been made to secure good apartments will be\r\npromptly refunded.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL ADVICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose coming here to consult us personally, should bring the money to\r\npay for our services and for board and care while remaining here, in the\r\nform of drafts on New York City, Boston or Chicago, and _not_ in the\r\nform of checks on a local or home bank. Such drafts can be purchased in\r\nthe home bank by paying a small amount for the exchange. If more\r\nconvenient, post office orders payable at Buffalo post office will do.\r\n\r\n\r\nVISITING PATIENTS WHO RESIDE AT A DISTANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are frequently asked to visit patients residing hundreds of miles\r\naway, that we may personally examine their cases, or perform difficult\r\nsurgical operations. We can seldom comply with such requests as the time\r\nof our professional Staff is generally very fully occupied.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO PHYSICIANS\r\n\r\nwishing to consult us in intricate cases of chronic diseases under their\r\ntreatment, we desire to say that we shall, as in the past, take pleasure\r\nin responding to their solicitations. We have all the necessary\r\ninstruments and appliances required in executing the most difficult\r\nsurgical operations, and, as we have had much experience in this\r\ndepartment, we are always ready and able to assist physicians who do not\r\npractice operative surgery. In this age of railways and telegraphs\r\nmedical and surgical aid can be summoned from a distance and promptly\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR MEDICINES\r\n\r\n\r\nas put up for sale through druggists, are not recommended as\r\n\"cure-alls,\" or panaceas, but only as superior remedies for certain\r\ncommon and easily-recognized diseases. They are our favorite\r\nprescriptions, improved and perfected by long study and a vast\r\nexperience in the treatment of chronic diseases, and have gained\r\nworld-wide celebrity and sale. We are well aware that there are many\r\nchronic diseases that can only be successfully treated and cured by\r\ncareful adaptation of remedies to each individual case. This is\r\nespecially true of the ever-varying and delicate diseases of the kidneys\r\nand bladder. It is not less so with reference to nervous debility,\r\ninvoluntary vital losses, with which so many young and middle-aged men\r\nare afflicted; and we may also include in this list epilepsy or fits,\r\nparalysis or palsy, obstinate gleety discharges, and many other chronic\r\nand delicate ailments of which our staff of physicians and surgeons cure\r\nannually many thousands of cases, but _for which we do not recommend_\r\nany of our put-up, ready-made, or proprietary medicines.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO RELATIONSHIP WITH HUMBUGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHad our put-up or proprietary medicines, as sold by druggists the world\r\nover, been adapted to all classes and forms of chronic diseases, there\r\nwould have been no necessity for our organizing a competent staff of\r\nphysicians and surgeons to act as experts in the treatment of difficult,\r\nobscure, and complicated cases of chronic diseases. That we keep\r\nconstantly employed, in our Buffalo and London institutions, eighteen\r\nmedical gentlemen, with such helpers as chemists, clerks, etc., is\r\nindisputable proof that the medicines we offer for sale through\r\ndruggists should not be classed with the humbug nostrums recommended to\r\ncure everything. They are the outgrowth of our vast and extended\r\npractice in the treatment of chronic diseases; are well-tried,\r\nworld-famed, and _honest medicines_. They are not unduly puffed and\r\nlauded, but simply recommended for such diseases as are easily\r\nrecognized and which they are _known to cure._\r\n\r\n\r\nNOT CONFINED IN PRESCRIBING\r\n\r\n\r\nOur physicians, in the treatment of cases consulting us, prescribe just\r\nsuch medicines as are adapted to each particular case. _They are not\r\nconfined in the least_ to our list of a few put-up or proprietary\r\nmedicines (valuable as they are when applicable to the case) but resort\r\nto the whole broad range of the _materia medica_, employed by the most\r\nadvanced physicians of the age. They are not hampered by any school,\r\n_ism_ or \"_pathy_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR MEDICINES PREPARED WITH THE GREATEST CARE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe medicines employed are all prepared in our own Laboratory by skilled\r\nchemists and pharmacists, and the greatest care is exercised to have\r\nthem manufactured from the freshest and purest ingredients. Our Faculty\r\nprobably employ a greater number and variety of native roots, barks, and\r\nherbs, in their practice then are used in any other invalids' resort in\r\nthe land. Using vast quantities of these indigenous medicines, we can\r\nafford and do not neglect to have them gathered with great care, at the\r\nproper seasons of the year, so that their medicinal properties may be\r\nmost reliable. Too little attention is generally paid to this matter,\r\nand many failures result from the prescribing of worthless medicines by\r\nphysicians who have to depend for their supplies upon manufacturers who\r\nare careless or indifferent in obtaining the crude plants and roots from\r\nwhich to manufacture their medicines for the market. While depending\r\nlargely upon solid and fluid extracts of native plants, roots, barks,\r\nand herbs, in prescribing for disease, yet we do not use them to the\r\nexclusion of other valuable curative drugs and chemicals. We aim to be\r\nunprejudiced and independent in our selection of remedies, adopting at\r\nall times a rational system of therapeutics. This liberal course of\r\naction has, in a vast experience, proved most successful.\r\n\r\n\r\n    WORLD'S DISPENSARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION,\r\n    663 MAIN STREET, BUFFALO, N.Y.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT GARFIELD'S\r\n\r\nENDORSEMENT OF THE\r\n\r\nINVALIDS' HOTEL AND SURGICAL INSTITUTE\r\n\r\n_AND ITS FOUNDER._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following letter from an eminent lawyer of Tennessee, is noteworthy,\r\ninasmuch as it shows the estimation in which Dr. Pierce and the\r\ninstitutions which he has founded were held by the lamented Garfield,\r\nwho was one of the Doctor's intimate friends and colleagues while he was\r\nserving as a member of Congress:\r\n\r\n    OFFICE OF H.F.

I am perfectly satisfied with the explanation, and ask pardon for\r\nthe sharp letter written you some days since. The mails are very\r\nirregular, as you know, and we are too apt to be impatient and attribute\r\nour mishaps to the wrong cause. Your honesty, integrity and ability are\r\nnot doubted in the least by me.\r\n\r\nI have, perhaps, a higher endorsement of you than any other patient\r\nunder your care, and for your gratification I will give it to you.\r\n\r\nSome time since I was in conversation with Congressman Pettibone, of\r\nthis State, when the following conversation took place: \"You say,\" said\r\nthe Major, \"that you have visited Dr. Pierce's medical establishment in\r\nBuffalo, New York?\" \"Yes, sir, I did.\" \"You found everything as\r\nrepresented?\" \"Yes, sir, as was represented, and which I assure you was\r\nquite encouraging to a man who had traveled as far as I had to visit an\r\ninstitution of that kind.\" \"That man, Dr. Pierce,\" said the Major, \"is\r\none of the best men of the times. While at Washington, during my first\r\nterm,\" he continued, \"one day I was in President Garfield's room and a\r\nfine-looking, broad-foreheaded gentleman came in, and President Garfield\r\narose and took him by the hand and said, 'Good morning, Doctor, I am so\r\nglad to see you,' and then turned and introduced him to me as Dr.\r\nPierce, of Buffalo, New York. Knowing the Doctor by reputation, and\r\nhaving seen his pictures, I at once recognized him. He, in a short time,\r\nleft the room, and Garfield said to me, 'Major, that is one of the best\r\nmen in the world, and he is at the head of one of the best medical\r\ninstitutions in the world.'\"\r\n\r\nWith this high endorsement, I have unbounded confidence in your\r\nintegrity and ability.\r\n\r\n    Very truly yours,\r\n    H.F.

PIERCE is President. The hotel itself is\r\na wonderful affair, combining all the comforts and conveniences of a\r\nluxurious home with the most complete facilities for the successful\r\ntreatment of all chronic diseases incident to humanity. Dr. PIERCE has a\r\nworld-wide fame as a skillful practitioner, and his corps of assistants\r\ncomprises many physicians and surgeons of great ability and large\r\nexperience in the treatment of chronic and surgical diseases. Those who\r\nhave been treated by the Association are loud in their praises, and we\r\nunderstand that the number of its patients increases with each\r\nsucceeding year. The country is full of people who have been \"doctoring\"\r\nyear after year without successful results, and the probabilities are\r\nthat in a majority of such cases a few months spent at the Invalids'\r\nHotel and Surgical Institute in the care of its medical experts, would\r\nresult in material and permanent benefit.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_FROM THE WASHINGTON (D.C.)

This Institute is organized with a full staff of\r\neighteen physicians and surgeons, and the hotel is exclusively devoted\r\nto treatment of chronic diseases. This corps of doctors make a specialty\r\nof chronic maladies, and the Institute is reputed to have abundant\r\nskill, facilities and apparatus for the successful treatment of every\r\nform of chronic ailment, whether requiring for its cure medical or\r\nsurgical means.\r\n\r\nThe building occupied is a massive one of five stories.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_FROM THE MISSOURI REPUBLICAN_ (_ST.

The\r\nprominence which he has attained has been reached through strictly\r\nlegitimate means, and so far, therefore, he deserves the enviable\r\nreputation which he enjoys. This large measure of success is the result\r\nof a thorough and careful preparation for his calling, and extensive\r\nreading during a long and unusually large practice, which has enabled\r\nhim to gain high commendation, even from his professional brethren.\r\nDevoting his attention to certain specialties of the science he has so\r\ncarefully investigated, he has been rewarded in a remarkable degree. In\r\nthese specialties he has become a recognized leader. Not a few of the\r\nremedies prescribed by him have, it is said, been adopted and prescribed\r\nby physicians in their private practice. His pamphlets and larger works\r\nhave been received as useful contributions to medical knowledge. He has\r\nrecently added another, and perhaps more important work, because of more\r\ngeneral application, to the list of his published writings. This book,\r\nentitled \"The People's Common Sense Medical Adviser,\" is designed to\r\nenter into general circulation. For his labors in this direction, Dr.\r\nPIERCE has received acknowledgments and honors from many sources, and\r\nespecially scientific degrees from two of the first medical institutions\r\nin the land. His works have been translated into the German, Spanish,\r\nFrench, and other foreign languages.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_FROM THE TOLEDO BLADE_.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. PIERCE has now been before the general public long enough to enable\r\nthe formation of a careful estimate of the efficiency of his treatment\r\nand his medicines, and the verdict, we are glad to know, has been\r\nuniversally favorable to both.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_FROM THE ST.

The only reliable physician, in these days of complicated\r\ndisorders and high-pressure living, is the \"Specialist,\" the man who\r\nunderstands his own branch of the business. Such, in his line, is Dr.\r\nPierce. He has written a \"Common Sense Medical Adviser,\" which is well\r\nworth reading. With strict business honor, high professional skill,\r\nreasonable fees, and a large corps of competent assistants Dr. Pierce\r\nhas made his name as familiar as \"household words.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom _the Rocky Mountain Herald_.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. R.V. PIERCE, the greatest American specialist, and proprietor of the\r\nWorld's Dispensary, Buffalo, N.Y., has sent us his new book entitled\r\n\"The People's Common Sense Medical Adviser,\" which is a handsome, large\r\nvolume, elegantly got up, with hundreds of wood-cuts and colored\r\nplates, and a complete cyclopedia of medical teachings for old and young\r\nof both sexes. _It has every thing in it,_ according to the latest\r\nscientific discoveries, and withal is wonderfully _commomensical_ in its\r\nstyle and teachings.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_From the Lafayette Daily Courier._\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. R.V. PIERCE, of Buffalo, distinguished in surgery, and the general\r\npractice of the profession he honors, has made a valuable contribution\r\nto the medical literature of the day, in a comprehensive work entitled\r\n\"The People's Common Sense Medical Adviser.\" While scientific\r\nthroughout, it is singularly free from technical and stilted terms. It\r\ncomes right down to the common-sense of every-day life, and, to quote\r\nfrom the author himself, seeks to \"inculcate the facts of science rather\r\nthan the theories of philosophy.\" This entertaining and really\r\ninstructive work seems to be in harmony with the enlarged sphere of\r\nthought, as touching the open polar sea of evolution. He considers man\r\nin every phase of his existence, from the rayless atom to the grand\r\nupbuilding of the noblest work of God. Dr. PIERCE is a noble specimen of\r\nAmerican manhood. He has sprung from the people, and with many\r\nsympathies in common with the masses, has sought to render them a\r\nsubstantial service in this the great work of his life.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_From the New York Independent._\r\n\r\nLAURELS FOR TRUE WORTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"A wise physician, skill'd our wounds to heal,\r\n    Is more than armies to the public weal.\"\r\n\r\nTo be honored in his own land is the crowning blessing of the man who\r\nhas been \"the architect of his own fortune\"--the man who has made for\r\nhimself, with his own hands and brain, a princely fortune and an\r\nenduring fame. From COMLEY'S History of New York State, containing\r\nbiographical sketches of the men who \"have given wealth, stamina, and\r\ncharacter\" to the Empire State, we clip the following brief sketch of\r\nthe distinguished physician, Dr. R.V. PIERCE, of Buffalo: \"Every nation\r\nowes its peculiar character, its prosperity--in brief, every thing that\r\ndistinguishes it as an individual nation,--to the few men belonging to\r\nit who have the courage to step beyond the boundaries prescribed by\r\npartisanship, professional tradition, or social customs. In professional\r\nno less than in political life there occasionally arise men who burst\r\nthe fetters of conventionalism, indignantly rejecting the arbitrary\r\nlimits imposed upon their activity, and step boldly forward into new\r\nfields of enterprise. We call these men _self-made._ The nation claims\r\nthem as her proudest ornaments--the men upon whom she can rely, in peace\r\nfor her glory, in war for her succor. Of this class of men the medical\r\nprofession has furnished a distinguished example in the successful and\r\njustly-celebrated physician, Dr. R.V. PIERCE, of Buffalo, N.Y., and any\r\nhistory treating of the industries of the Empire State would be\r\nincomplete without a sketch of his useful and earnest work. * * *\r\nSpecially educated for the profession which he so eminently adorns, he\r\nearly supplemented his studies by extensive and original research in its\r\nseveral departments. He brought to his chosen work acute perceptive and\r\nreflective powers, and that indomitable energy that neither shrinks at\r\nobstacles nor yields to circumstances. In physique, Dr. PIERCE is an\r\nideal type of American manhood. Of medium stature, robust, his\r\nappearance is characterized by a healthful, vigorous vitality, while the\r\nfull, lofty brow and handsomely cut features are indicative of that\r\ncomprehensive mental power and remarkable business sagacity which have\r\ncombined to place him among the distinguished men of the age. * * * As\r\nan earnest worker for the welfare of his fellow-men, Dr. PIERCE has won\r\ntheir warmest sympathy and esteem. While seeking to be their servant\r\nonly, he has become a prince among them. Yet the immense fortune\r\nlavished upon him by a generous people he hoards not, but invests in the\r\nerection and establishment of institutions directly contributive to the\r\npublic good, the people thus realizing, in their liberal patronage, a\r\nnew meaning of the beautiful Oriental custom of casting bread upon the\r\nwaters. Noted in both public and private life for his unswerving\r\nintegrity and all those sterling virtues that ennoble manhood, Dr.\r\nPIERCE ranks high among those few men whose names the Empire State is\r\njustly proud to inscribe upon her roll of honor.\" Dr. PIERCE has lately\r\nerected a palatial Invalids' Hotel for the reception of his patients, at\r\na cost of over half a million dollars.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nA MAN OF THE TIME.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Dr. R.V. PIERCE, the _Buffalo_ (N.Y.) _Commercial_ says: \"He\r\ncame here an unknown man, almost friendless, with no capital except his\r\nown manhood, which, however, included plenty of brains and pluck,\r\nindomitable perseverance, and inborn uprightness, capital enough for any\r\nman in this progressive country, if only he has good health and habits\r\nas well. He had all these great natural advantages, and one thing more,\r\nan excellent education. He had studied medicine and been regularly\r\nlicensed to practice as a physician. But he was still a student, fond of\r\ninvestigation and experiment. He discovered, or invented, important\r\nremedial agencies or compounds. Not choosing to wait wearily for the\r\nsick and suffering to find out (without any body to tell them) that he\r\ncould do them good, he advertised his medicines and invited the whole\r\nprofession of every school, to examine and pronounce judgment on his\r\nformulas. He advertised liberally, profusely, but with extraordinary\r\nshrewdness, and with a method which is in itself a lesson to all who\r\nseek business by that perfectly legitimate means. His success has been\r\nsomething marvelous--so great, indeed, that it must be due to intrinsic\r\nmerit in the articles he sells, more even than to his unparalleled skill\r\nin the use of printer's ink. The present writer once asked a\r\ndistinguished dispensing druggist to explain the secret of the almost\r\nuniversal demand for Dr. PIERCE'S medicines. He said they were in fact\r\ngenuine medicines--such compounds as every good physician would\r\nprescribe for the diseases which they were advertised to cure. Of\r\ncourse, they cost less than any druggist would charge for the same\r\narticle, supplied on a physician's prescription, and, besides, there was\r\nthe doctor's fee saved. Moreover, buying the drugs in such enormous\r\nquantities, having perfect apparatus for purifying and compounding the\r\nmixture, he could not only get better articles in the first place, but\r\npresent the medicine in better form and cheaper than the same mixture\r\ncould possibly be obtained from any other source.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_Extracts from Biographical Sketches of New York Senators._\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the age of eighteen, he (Dr. PIERCE) entered a medical school, and\r\nproved a devoted student, graduating at twenty-three with the highest\r\nhonors. A simple knowledge of the routine of practice as then in vogue,\r\nwas not enough. He sought new means of healing, and explored \"schools\"\r\nof practice that were prohibited by his sect. He denounced errors in\r\nthe prevailing \"schools\" and accepted truths belonging to those\r\nprohibited. Every one knows how such daring and destructive innovations\r\nare regarded by the medical profession generally. Dr. PIERCE was no\r\nexception to the rule. But he paid no attention to detraction, pursuing\r\nhis own way with that energy which proves now to be a most excellent\r\nally of his medical instincts.\r\n\r\nThe World's Dispensary is to-day the greatest institution of its kind in\r\nthe world. More than two hundred persons are employed, eighteen being\r\nskillful physicians and surgeons, each devoting himself to a special\r\nbranch of the profession, all acting together when required, as a\r\ncouncil. The printing department of the Dispensary is larger than the\r\nsimilar department of any paper outside of the _New York Herald._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_From The New York Times._\r\n\r\nWELL-MERITED SUCCESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe author of \"The People's Medical Adviser\" is well-known to the\r\nAmerican public as a physician of fine attainments, and his Family\r\nMedicines are favorite remedies in thousands of our households. As a\r\ncounselor and friend, Dr. PIERCE is a cultured, courteous gentleman. He\r\nhas devoted all his energies to the alleviation of human suffering. With\r\nthis end in view and his whole heart in his labors, he has achieved\r\nmarked and merited success. There can be no real success without true\r\nmerit. That his success is _real_, is evidenced by the fact that his\r\nreputation, as a man and physician, does not deteriorate; and the fact\r\nthat there is a steadily increasing demand for his medicines, proves\r\nthat they are not nostrums, but reliable remedies for disease.

They are parasitic,\r\npossess neither mouth, stomach, thorax, nor abdomen, and are,\r\nnecessarily, short-lived.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3: Dalton--Human Physiology.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4: In the use of the terms psychical and psychological, we have\r\nobserved the distinction which metaphysicians have recently made. They\r\nemploy the term psychical to indicate the relation of the human soul to\r\nsense, appetite, propensity, etc., and psychological, as indicating the\r\nultimates of spiritual being. In this manner we use the word psychical\r\nas describing the relationship of the soul to animal experiences and\r\nbeing, and psychological as referring to the spiritual potencies of the\r\nsoul. The distinction being introduced, we continue its use rather then\r\ncoin new words.\r\n\r\nFootnote 5: Certain disturbances of the bodily organs excite fear. The\r\napprehension of danger, or simply mental excitement, does not explain\r\nwhat is called \"water fright,\" \"stage fright,\" terror excited by the\r\nraging of a storm, or the rocking of a boat. In such instances the heart\r\nmay beat heavily, the respiration be irregular and attended by\r\nprecordial oppression, giddiness, weakness, and physical inability to\r\narticulate a word or recall a thought. These bodily conditions are not\r\nsubject to the control of the will, but arise when individuals are\r\nperfectly assured that no danger threatens. At other times, as in a\r\nfearful tempest upon the sea, although the danger be imminent, if the\r\nbodily functions are not disturbed, there is not the least manifestation\r\nof fear.\r\n\r\nFootnote 6: A _placebo_ is a harmless and valueless prescription, which\r\nphysicians sometimes make merely to gratify the patient, as a dose of\r\n\"bread pills,\" etc.",
