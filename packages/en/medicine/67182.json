TO A.D. 540.\r\n\r\n    Πλείη μὲν γὰρ γαῖα κακῶν, πλείη δὲ θάλασσα·\r\n    Νοῦσοι δ’ ἀνθρώποισιν ἐφ’ ἡμέρῃ ἠδ’ ἐπὶ νυκτὶ\r\n    Αὐτόματοι φοιτῶσι.\r\n                                              HESIOD.\r\n\r\n    The earth’s full of maladies, and full the sea,\r\n    Which set upon us both by night and day.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is recorded that in the month Adar,--answering, according to our\r\ncomputation of time, to the period between the middle of February\r\nand March, the end of the Jewish year,--during the reign of Pharaoh\r\nIV., king of Egypt, in the year of the world 2509 (anno 1495 before\r\nthe Christian era), and in the 80th year of the life of Moses, the\r\nsacred historian and great captain of the hosts of Israel, many awful\r\nprodigies in the natural world commenced, especially in commotions of\r\nthe elements, which were succeeded by a pestilence destructive both\r\nto men and beasts in the low lands of Egypt. This terrible pestilence\r\nwas preceded by fearful commotions of the elements,--hail, thunder\r\nand lightning, heat and drought, the generation of insects, &c.; for\r\nthe summer had been hot, and attended with heavy cold nocturnal dews\r\nalternating with rains, after a humid winter. The weather had been very\r\nvariable; the excessive heats and hot winds exhausted the inhabitants\r\nby day, and the cold damp dews chilled them by night: the atmosphere\r\nwas so filled with fiery elements, and clouds of dust and sand,\r\nthat men and cattle were in imminent danger of suffocation, and were\r\ncompelled to seek shelter from these dry storms and tempests. On the\r\n10th, universal darkness prevailed, which continued for three days;\r\nand on the 14th, deadly pestilence commenced, which, in one sudden and\r\nuniversal destruction, swept away millions from the face of nature.\r\n\r\nAnno 1471 B.C., by dire pestilence, the murmurers and mutineers in the\r\ncompany of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram were destroyed in the encampment\r\nat Kadesh, in the desert of Paran, to the number of 14,700 persons;\r\nand nineteen years after (1452 B.C.), by a similar pestilence, of the\r\nriotous and drunken worshippers of Baal-peor, 24,000 men and women\r\nperished.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1310 B.C., sixty years previous to the Trojan war,\r\nthe island of Ægina was visited by an epidemic pestilence, which was\r\nfatal to great numbers.\r\n\r\nAnno 1141 B.C., the people of Ashdod, a place lying on the seashore\r\nbetween Gaza and Joppa, which is called in the New Testament Azotus,\r\nwere visited by an epidemic pestilence termed EMERODS--an affection of\r\nthe bowels, or malignant dysentery.\r\n\r\nIn the time of David, 1017 B.C., there broke out a pestilence\r\nwhich in three days destroyed 70,000 persons. About the period of\r\nthis infliction, the first dreadful epoch of Spanish epidemiology is\r\nrecorded. The period, however, has been variously given; by some, it\r\nis fixed at 1100 B.C., while other writers mention it as\r\nhaving occurred during the great plague or dearth in Egypt. There were,\r\nwithout interruption, _twenty-five years_ of drought in Spain;\r\nsprings were dried up, rivers became fordable, their waters becoming\r\nalmost stagnant; there was neither pasture for beasts nor fruit for\r\nman; so great was the barrenness of the land, that there was scarcely\r\nany green thing to be found, except some olive-trees on the banks\r\nof the Ebro and the Guadalquiver. Such, says the historian, was the\r\nmelancholy state of our ancient Spain; “full of dreadful mortalities,\r\nplagues, and miseries of every description, which, with emigration to\r\nother lands, nearly depopulated our country.”\r\n\r\nPlutarch mentions the occurrence of a great pestilence that happened in\r\nRome in the year 790 B.C., soon after the murder of Tatius: it was so\r\nrapidly fatal that it is represented as killing almost instantaneously;\r\ncattle as well as men were swept away, and all nature appeared one\r\ndesolate and abandoned waste: during this awful period it is said to\r\nhave rained blood, or crimson insects which turned the waters to the\r\ncolour of blood, as happened in Egypt during the reign of Pharaoh: the\r\ncrops failed, and the country of Campania may be said to have been\r\nravaged by the sword, famine, and pestilence. Plutarch also gives an\r\naccount of an epidemic pestilence which afflicted the inhabitants of\r\nItaly, especially the capital of the empire, during the reign of Numa\r\nPompilius, of Hezekiah over Judah, and of Sennacherib over Assyria in\r\nthe year 710 B.C.: by this pestilence 185,000 of the Assyrian armies\r\nperished at the siege of Jerusalem, which compelled the assailants to\r\nraise the siege and to return to Nineveh, even after they had taken\r\nall the principal cities of Judah, including Libnah, a city situated\r\nabout twelve miles south-west of Jerusalem. It was at this period that\r\nNuma Pompilius instituted the Salii, a college of priests of Mars, who\r\ncarried the sacred shields in procession, to stop the pestilence.\r\n\r\nLivy describes another pestilence which occurred at Rome during\r\nthe reign of Tullus Hostilius, 694 B.C. Zosimus, an officer during\r\nthe reign of Theodosius the Younger, speaks of the prevalence of a\r\npestilence in the city of Rome during the reign of Tarquin, anno 671\r\nB.C.; and Dionysius Halicarnassus, Murator, and Functius have also\r\nmentioned the occurrence of a great famine and pestilence in Rome, anno\r\n545 B.C., which nearly depopulated Velitræ, an ancient town of Latium\r\non the Appian Road, about twenty miles to the east of Rome. A murrain\r\nprevailed about this time among their cattle, which destroyed vast\r\nnumbers, and such havoc was made among the inhabitants of Latium that\r\nthe Volsci were necessitated to apply to the Romans to re-people their\r\ncities. Rome also suffered the year subsequently, as did Campania,\r\ncelebrated for its lake Avernus, which emitted such poisonous vapours\r\nthat birds would not go near its banks: this pestilence spared neither\r\nage nor constitution, and yielded to no remedies. It appeared suddenly,\r\ndestroyed its victims rapidly, and on the approach of continued cold\r\nweather disappeared as suddenly as it came.\r\n\r\nAnno 594 B.C. There perished this year a third part of the\r\ninhabitants of Jerusalem by a severe pestilence.\r\n\r\nHerodotus and Justin have recorded the destruction of the army of\r\nXerxes, when retreating into Asia after his defeat at the battle of\r\nSalamis, by a grievous pestilence, which attacked both land and sea\r\nforces, especially the army under the command of General Mardonius,\r\nanno 480 B.C.: the victims were numbered at 150,000. During\r\nthis period Diodorus Siculus writes that the ancient Spanish troops\r\nwere the most faithful and courageous, and constituted almost always\r\nthe strength of the Carthaginian armies: he continues,--They (the\r\nCarthaginians) took treasure and soldiers, who by their valour aided\r\nthe republic in their most critical times of war. The Spanish soldiers\r\nendured hardship with indomitable courage, and, being naturally of a\r\nrobust make, were not intimidated by the pestilence which destroyed\r\nothers of the Carthaginian army of that time, nor by the 150,000 dead\r\nbodies--plague-victims, which without burial strewed the plains. All\r\nthese circumstances did not prevent their appearing in arms, and\r\ndemanding the capitulation of Syracuse from its first tyrant, whilst\r\nat the same time the other troops, shamefully abandoned by their\r\nchiefs, took to a precipitate flight, and surrendered at discretion.\r\nHistory says nothing of the means taken for the curing of this\r\nhorrible pestilence at Syracuse, nor shows clearly why the Spaniards\r\nalone enjoyed an immunity from this pestilence, which was worthy of\r\nbeing perpetuated in history. Villalba however mentions some physical\r\ncauses which he considers contributed to the remarkable exemption of\r\nthe Spaniards from the dire pestilence: he states that the ancient\r\nSpaniards were a sober race; and, according to all authorities,\r\nsobriety is a powerful means of protection against disease. Filarcus,\r\na citizen of Athens, was singularly struck with this fact: among the\r\nrich who lived frugally, drank water alone, and were clothed with the\r\nrichest garments, moderation and bodily cleanliness were observed to be\r\nof the highest importance in maintaining the sensible and insensible\r\nperspiration; these functions of secretion and of excretion being\r\nessential in order that the integral parts of the blood should preserve\r\nits purity, its weight, its normal state of electricity, and natural\r\nfluidity, upon which depend the preservation of health and the power\r\nof resisting disease in times of epidemics, as is affirmed by medical\r\njurists, and as the ancient Spaniards practised. He continues,--Bathing\r\nis also an efficacious means of removing the impurities that opposed\r\nthe sensible and insensible perspiration; and it would appear that in\r\nSpain, long before the Second Punic War, bathing was in general favour.\r\nThe unmeaning sneer of Diodorus Siculus at the habit of the Spaniards\r\nof washing their entire bodies with urine, will be recollected, whilst\r\nGalen says that in Syria they avoid the plague by simply drinking\r\nthat liquid excrement. That the Spaniards used urine advantageously\r\nas a topical lotion we shall find in the treatises on baths and other\r\nsubjects of ancient Spain. Drs. Ribeiro and Sanchez assert, with some\r\nfoundation, that the use of linen in Europe has caused pestilence to\r\nbe less frequent; thus, as it were, contributing to the cleanliness\r\nwhich the ancients obtained by the use of their public baths. To a\r\nsimilar cause we may attribute the rarity with which the Spaniards\r\nwere attacked by the aforesaid frightful pestilence. Catullus, Silius\r\nItalicus, and Gratius Faliscus eulogize the vapour baths of the ancient\r\nSætabi: in fine, says Villalba, the sobriety, personal cleanliness,\r\nbathing in common water, washing with urine, vapour baths, and the\r\nwearing linen garments, with fortitude, concurred powerfully to the\r\nimmunity enjoyed from disease by our Spanish ancestors.\r\n\r\nAnno 476 B.C. During this and the succeeding years, says\r\nFlorian de Ocampo, there prevailed in Spain from time to time a\r\nseries of pestilences and other minor diseases, by which a multitude\r\nof persons perished. The Carthaginians, to appease the ire of the\r\ngods to whom they attributed these fatal visitations, offered up\r\nhuman sacrifices, and made incisions on their arms and legs, and on\r\nother parts of their bodies: they also immolated cattle of all kinds,\r\naccording to the severity of the pestilence.\r\n\r\nOrosius, another Spanish writer, and also Dionysius, relate the\r\noccurrence of a terrible plague at Rome, which caused great mortality,\r\n463 B.C. This was a grievous time, says the historian, men\r\nand beasts being equally afflicted. The disease was preceded by great\r\nheat and drought, and the calamities and fatigues of war, which were\r\ngreatly augmented by crowds of countrymen and herds of cattle received\r\nwithin the walls of the city, in order to avoid the ravages and\r\nplunderings of the Latins and Hernici, who then desolated the country.\r\nThe epidemic first seized on horses and horned cattle, then on man,\r\nthe poorer people being the chief victims: it began about the calends\r\nof September, and raged until the end of November. The two consuls\r\nServilius and Æbutius, and many other illustrious Romans, fell victims\r\nto the disease.\r\n\r\nLivy and Dionysius inform us that, anno 452 B.C., nearly\r\none-half of the inhabitants of Rome were destroyed by the pestilence\r\n_loimikié_, which was also communicated to the Æqui, the\r\nVolsci, and the Sabines, and caused a great mortality amongst them.\r\nThe distress and consternation being general, the land was left\r\nuncultivated, and the miseries of famine threatened to overwhelm those\r\nwho survived the epidemic. This pestilence was succeeded by another,\r\nwhich, if possible, was more grievous; it lasted from 443 to 438\r\nB.C. In time, so frequently had Rome been scourged by repeated\r\nepidemic pestilences, that Livy styled it “urbs assiduis exhausta\r\nfuneribus.”\r\n\r\nIn the second year of the Peloponnesian War, 435 B.C., epidemic\r\npestilence broke out at Athens, where the inhabitants of the Athenian\r\nterritory were crowded together into the city to avoid the ravages of\r\nthe Lacedemonians: it destroyed 5000 of the prime of their armies,\r\nand an immense number of the poor, and continued without interruption\r\nfor five years. It began towards the close of an open spring, after\r\na severe winter, raged the four following summers and autumns, was\r\nespecially fatal to their armies at the siege of Epidaurus and Potidea,\r\nand continued all through the severe winters. Thucydides, Lucretius,\r\nAnacharsis, Plutarch, and Hippocrates give an account of a similar\r\npestilence which ravaged Persia about the same period. Artaxerxes,\r\nthe king of Persia, sent for the great physician of Cos and Greece\r\nto come and arrest its progress, but Hippocrates nobly answered the\r\nPersian monarch in these words, addressing Hystaspes, prefect of the\r\nHellespont: “To the epistle which you have sent, and you have asserted\r\nto come from the king, write to the king as I briefly answer,--We\r\nenjoy victuals, clothing, homes, and everything necessary for life\r\nin abundance; and it is neither right for me to use the wealth of\r\nthe Persians, nor to liberate barbarians from diseases while they\r\nmay be the enemies of Greece. Farewell.” Thucydides describes the\r\nsymptoms of the disease in a cursory manner; Lucretius more minutely;\r\nand from these historians we infer the following morbid phenomena.\r\nThe invasion was sudden and unexpected; the disease commenced with a\r\nviolent headache, fiery redness of the eyes, succeeded by pains and\r\ninflammation of the throat, difficulty of breathing, and offensive\r\nbreath, a sneezing and hoarseness, violent fever with insatiable\r\nthirst supervening: watchfulness and delirium or stupor, vomiting of\r\nbilious matter, utter prostration of strength, and urgent flux of the\r\nbowels, were noticed in the second stage of the disease. In the first\r\nstage, the stools were dark and fœtid: there were hiccough, bleeding\r\nat the gums, throat, nose, stomach, and bowels,--convulsions: pustules\r\nor sores of a livid hue were also observed about the bodies of those\r\naffected. This bilious plague or pestilence of Athens exhibited, from\r\nthe foregoing accounts, symptoms analogous to those of the bilious\r\nremittent or yellow fever of America and the West Indies, and would\r\nappear to have arisen from similar causes.\r\n\r\nThe historian, in speaking of the calamity, brings the causes of the\r\npestilence to our view. He says, “As they had no houses, but dwelt in\r\nbooths all the summer season, where there was scarcely room to breathe,\r\nthe pestilence destroyed with the greatest confusion, so that they\r\nlay together in heaps, the dying upon the dead, and the dead upon the\r\ndying: they were tumbling one over the other in the public streets, or\r\nlay expiring round every fountain, whither they had crept to assuage\r\nthe intolerable thirst which was consuming them. The temples of which\r\nthey had taken possession were full of the dead bodies of those who had\r\nexpired there.”\r\n\r\nAnno 427 B.C. a cruel pestilence or plague spread almost\r\nthrough the world. Mariana and other Spanish writers say that it\r\ncommenced in Egypt, and, travelling through all the intervening\r\ncountries, reached Spain: the mortality in most places began among the\r\ncattle. From various accounts it would appear that the country people\r\nwere first affected with this pestilence; afterwards the inhabitants\r\nin the towns. Anno 404 B.C. Carthage was almost depopulated,\r\nas recorded by Justin and Diodorus Siculus. The Carthaginians sent on\r\nan expedition under Himilco to reduce revolted Sicily to subjection,\r\nwere destroyed in great numbers by pestilence; it was so fatal that,\r\naccording to one writer, Ocampo, there did not escape either Mallorcan\r\nslingers, Celts, Andalusians, or Africans; many fell dead as soon as\r\nthey took the disease. The bad policy of leaving their dead bodies\r\nunburied on the plains, a prey to dogs, &c., contributed in no\r\nsmall degree to the propagation and virulence of the epidemic. This\r\npestilence was distinguished by the remarkable symptoms of violent\r\ndysentery, severe fever, acute pains in all parts of the body, anguish,\r\nand great depression of both mind and body. Similar disasters have\r\nattended expeditions and long campaigns in warm climates within our\r\nown time, as our expeditions into Egypt, Flanders, Brabant, the West\r\nIndies, &c. testify.\r\n\r\nAnnis 393 and 383 B.C. the armies of Gaul and Rome were afflicted with\r\nsore pestilence. In the latter year, there were many months of severe\r\ndrought in Andalusia and along the southern coasts, from the Pyrenees\r\nas far as Cape St. Vincent; great famine ensued, with pestilential\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\nRome was revisited by pestilence anno 366 B.C.: it raged\r\ndreadfully for three years, and swept away the great Camillus with\r\nmultitudes of his people. When the disease was at its height, it is\r\nreported that 10,000 citizens died daily: it prevailed terribly in the\r\nmonths of September, October, and November, and the Sibylline books and\r\nLectisternium were resorted to in vain. To add to their calamities and\r\ndistress, the earth opened in the midst of Rome, giving rise to the\r\ntragical and superstitious decease of Marcus Curtius, by his throwing\r\nhimself, for the salvation of the city, into the awful chasm on the\r\nsite of which the lake Alba soon after arose.\r\n\r\nOrosius in describing this pestilence says, “This was such a pestilence\r\nas generally proceeds from irregular seasons, extreme drought, heat\r\nof the spring, moisture in the summer and autumn;” which implies\r\nthat irregular seasons inducing a pestilential constitution of the\r\natmosphere, according to the doctrines of Hippocrates, who dictated\r\nmedicine to all the world in those days, were productive of pestilence.\r\n\r\nAnno 362 B.C. The war of Sicily being ended by the death of\r\nDionysius the greater, the Republic of Carthage sent a captain named\r\nBostan as the governor of Mallorca, Minorca, Iberia, and Formentera, in\r\norder that he should negociate with the Saguntians, and draw them over\r\nto their side.\r\n\r\nThe city of Saguntum, now called Murviedro, was visited by an epidemic\r\npestilence. There was a great scarcity of provisions, and many deaths\r\noccurred, even among the nobles. The people became sorrow-stricken and\r\ndisheartened, as reported by the magistrates to their new governor.\r\nIt may be inferred that the pestilence raged with severity, from its\r\nhaving affected the higher orders.\r\n\r\nAnnis 346 B.C. and 405 from the foundation of Rome,\r\nextraordinary inundations, with great damage to the cattle, fields,\r\nand buildings, occurred. All the cities along the coasts on the\r\nMediterranean Sea suffered also from earthquakes; Saguntum, a principal\r\ncity, having suffered the most. Annis 332, 296, and 291 B.C.\r\nRome was again visited by pestilence, which was particularly fatal to\r\nbreeding women and to breeding cattle. A similar visitation affected\r\nRome anno 272 B.C.\r\n\r\nAnno 237 B.C. the commotions of the elements in the shape of\r\nearthquakes, severe drought, with the want of sufficient food, caused\r\ngreat mortality among cattle and men in Spain, especially at Cadiz.\r\n\r\nAnno 218 B.C. the toils of war and the forced marches of\r\nthe Carthaginian armies on their route to besiege Saguntum, and\r\nthe unflinching and brave defence by wearying out the assailants,\r\n(says Mariana,) caused great pestilence among them. There were also\r\nearthquakes and pestilence in several provinces of Spain, also great\r\nstorms at sea, throwing on the land quantities of fish, some of which\r\nwere unknown until this occurrence. There was also a fatal epizootic\r\namong the dogs and birds.\r\n\r\nAnno 216 B.C. In the summer of this year a fatal pestilence\r\nbegan in the vicinity of Carthage. It was supposed that this putrid\r\ndisease arose from the crowded state of all places, from the multitude\r\nof sailors and soldiers there at the time, the country being in a badly\r\ncultivated state, the scarcity and bad quality of provisions, and\r\nfrom the stagnant lake, which had always been viewed as a source of\r\ndisease. For a considerable period it was limited to the place where\r\nit originated, but after a time other provinces became affected. Both\r\nrich and poor fell victims to this dire disease: some of the principal\r\nfamilies suffered; and Hamilca, the wife of Hannibal, and their\r\noffspring, were among its numerous victims.\r\n\r\nAnno 206 B.C. a vast pestilence, preceded by immense swarms\r\nof locusts, occurred in the land near Capua. The same historian, Livy,\r\nrelates that the Roman and Rhodian fleets, anchored at Phaselis in\r\nthe Gulf of Pamphylia in the midst of summer, and in an unwholesome\r\nsituation, suffered from pestilential diseases,--especially the rowers,\r\nwho were subjected to hard labour, and exposed to the burning rays\r\nof the sun. He continues, that violent pestilence ravaged all Italy\r\nannis 182 and 181 B.C. This continued for several years;\r\nsevere drought for six months, and consequent dearth of corn happened,\r\nfollowed by terrible storms, pernicious seasons, and awful commotions\r\nof the elements, coldness, dampness, moisture and dryness, noxious\r\nvapours, and putrid exhalations. This extraordinary season was followed\r\nby a great pestilence among cattle and among the inhabitants of Rome,\r\nin the summer and autumn of the year 177 B.C. This pestilence\r\ncontinued for four years, from 177 to 173, during which period swarms\r\nof locusts deluged Apulia, as the Pontine provinces were covered the\r\nprevious year. So destructive were their ravages, that Sicinius the\r\nprætor was commissioned with an army to drive them away!\r\n\r\n“Pestilentia quæ priore anno ingruerat in boves, eo verteret in hominum\r\nmorbos; qui inciderant haud facile septimum diem superabant: qui\r\nsuperaverant longinquo, maximæ quartanæ implacabantur, morbo. Servitia\r\nmaxime moriebantur, eorum strages per omnes vias insepultorum erat.\r\nNe liberorum quidem funeribus subficiebat. Cadavera intacta a canibus\r\nac vulturibus tabes absumebat; satisque constabat, nec illo, nec\r\npriore anno in tanta strage boûm hominumque vulturiûm usquam visum.”\r\nThe translation of this pithy passage conveys that the pestilence\r\nwhich first attacked cattle, fastened upon men,--those who survived\r\nthe seventh day did so with great difficulty, and were subsequently\r\nafflicted by disease (or fever) of a quartan form. The poor and lower\r\nclasses were those who suffered most, their dead carcases lying about\r\nthe highways,--dogs and vultures left the carcases untouched which were\r\nconsumed by corruption,--neither in this nor in a former year was\r\nthere a vulture seen. From this graphic detail we may infer that the\r\nbeasts of the field were first attacked, then mankind; that the disease\r\nunderwent a sort of crisis on the seventh day, terminating either\r\nin death or chronic distemper, as we see to be the case in our own\r\ndays; viz. consumption, dropsy, diseases of the liver and spleen, and\r\nague;--that it was most fatal among the lower orders, who are generally\r\nmore distressed in times of scarcity, and from other causes more\r\nsusceptible of disease, such as cold, damp abodes, and poor diet;--that\r\ncarnivorous animals were sick themselves, refusing to touch the carrion\r\ncarcases; in fact, the infected provinces were entirely deserted by\r\nvultures;--lastly, that the malady was similar to our yellow, bilious,\r\nremittent fever, in all its symptoms, as we see it occurring amongst us\r\nin various places--the West Indies, America, &c.\r\n\r\nOrosius gives us an account of another pestilence, which devastated\r\nRome, anno 144 B.C.\r\n\r\nIn the year 140 before the Christian era, the war of Viriathus having\r\nbeen concluded, the proconsul Q. Pompeius Rufus commenced blockading\r\nNumantia (now Algeria). The plan of his operations being to charge the\r\nair with mephitic vapours, he determined on turning the course of the\r\nriver Douro, and inundating the country round about by means of its\r\nwaters, which would have the effect not only of spoiling the atmosphere\r\nby its moist exhalations, but of inducing famine also, by the\r\ndestruction of all vegetation. These attempts were, however, fruitless,\r\ninasmuch as the Numantians, being a robust and warlike people, resisted\r\nthe consequences of the proconsul’s attempts against them. Having\r\nforeseen his intentions, they had supplied themselves with abundant\r\nprovisions, which they had intercepted from the Roman legions; while,\r\non the other hand, the Roman soldiers themselves fell victims to their\r\nown measures, pestilence having broken out among them--a malignant\r\ndysentery, equal in severity and fatality to that which formerly had\r\nlaid waste the army of Lucullus.\r\n\r\nAfter this period to about that of 134 B.C., Scipio Æmilianus,\r\ncalled the Numantine, organized his army, and having established\r\nadmirable rules of hygiene and semeiotics, whereby he preserved his\r\nformer strength and health, began to devastate the plains of Numantia,\r\nof Vacca, and Palestine. The want of water which was experienced in the\r\nlatter place (Palestine) forced them to make wells to obtain drinkable\r\nwater, but unfortunately the water thus obtained proved to be of a\r\ncharacter productive of a malignant epizootic, which destroyed their\r\nhorses and other beasts of burthen: the pestilence among their cattle\r\nincreasing, obliged them to change their quarters to the plains of\r\nNumantia in order to winter there.\r\n\r\nAnno 130 B.C. The famous Numantines, so much dreaded by the\r\nRomans on account of their valorous resistance, were not less feared by\r\nthe Greeks, than the horrible pestilence which prevailed in Numantia.\r\nThe Greek, Appianus Alexandrinus, speaks of them with admiration and\r\ndread. The Numantine people, who had hitherto resisted the corrupted\r\ncondition of the air, ultimately suffered such exhaustion for want of\r\nfood, their stores having been consumed, that after having subsisted on\r\ndressed skins of animals for several days, they fell into the frightful\r\nnecessity of becoming anthropophagi, so that from feeding on the bodies\r\nof those who fell defending their country, pestilence arose, which\r\nhastened the downfall of their city.\r\n\r\nAnno 126 B.C. Epidemic pestilence prevailed with great\r\nmortality in Africa. Orosius, Justin, and Livy, who have described\r\nit, attribute this pestilence to the stench arising from the putrid\r\ncarcases of dead locusts, which were brought over by a strong east\r\nwind in such multitudes that they devoured every green thing, even\r\nto the bark of trees; they were subsequently driven by a south wind\r\ninto the Mediterranean, and being again washed on shore in the warm\r\nseason of the year, putrefied, and produced this awful pestilence,\r\nwhich destroyed 800,000 in Numidia alone. On the sea-coast of Carthage\r\n200,000 perished. Of such terrible visitations by insects, which to\r\nthis day exist in the East at particular seasons, carrying destruction\r\nin their course, Lord Carnarvon gives a description in his ‘History\r\nof Portugal and Gallicia.’ It will convey a pretty good idea of their\r\ndestructiveness and of the distressing consequences. Speaking of\r\nnatural exhibitions, of which he was an eye-witness in Africa, he\r\nwrites thus: “A fall of locusts is beyond description the most awful\r\nimaginable--a most dreadful scourge, which is considered in eastern\r\nand northern countries the most unfailing manifestation of the wrath\r\nof God. Travelling along the western coast of Africa, I once beheld\r\nthis terrible infliction. These creatures fell in thousands and tens\r\nof thousands around us and upon us along the sands on which we were\r\nriding, and on the sea that was beating at our feet; yet we were\r\nremoved from their most oppressive influence; for, a few hundred yards\r\nto our right, darkening the air, the great innumerable host came on,\r\nslowly and steadily advancing in a direct line and in a mighty moving\r\ncolumn. The fall of locusts from this central column was so great, that\r\nwhen a cow directly under the line of flight, attempting ineffectually\r\nto graze in the field, approached her mouth to the grass, there rose\r\nimmediately so dense a swarm, that her head was for the moment almost\r\nconcealed from sight, and as she moved along, bewildered by this worse\r\nthan Egyptian plague, clouds of locusts rose up from under her feet,\r\nvisible even at a distance, as clouds of dust when set in motion by\r\nthe wind on a stormy day. At the extremity of the field I saw the\r\nhusbandmen bending over their staffs, and gazing with hopeless eyes\r\nupon that host of death which swept like a destroying angel over the\r\nland, and consigned to ruin all the prospects of the year; for wherever\r\nthat column winged its flight, beneath its withering influence the\r\ngolden glories of the harvest perished, and the leafy honours of the\r\nforest disappeared. There stood those ruined men silent and motionless,\r\noverwhelmed with the magnitude of their calamity, yet conscious of\r\ntheir utter inability to control it, while further on, where some\r\nwoodland lay in the immediate line of the advancing column, heath set\r\non fire, and trees kindling into a blaze, testified the general horror\r\nof a visitation which the ill-fated inhabitants endeavoured to avert by\r\nsuch a frightful remedy. They believed that the smoke arising from the\r\nburning forest, ascending into the air, would impede the direct march\r\nof the column, throw it into confusion, and drive the locusts out to\r\nsea, and thus deliver the country from their desolating presence.”\r\n\r\nDuring the civil wars which were excited by Sylla and Marius, the Roman\r\narmies lost 10,000 men by plague in the year 89 B.C.\r\n\r\nAnno 60 B.C. Spain, according to the opinion of several\r\nancient and modern writers, both foreign and national, was one of\r\nthe countries most subjected to the frightful disease of leprosy.\r\nSauvages has asserted that there were no lepers in France, save those\r\nthat came from Spain and America. Senertus states that in Spain and\r\nAfrica elephantiasis (leprosy) is more frequent than in any other\r\npart of the world. Dr. Casal coincides in this opinion, as may be\r\nseen in his ‘Natural and Medical History of the Principality of the\r\nAsturias;’ and, finally, the Academic Memoirs of Seville speak of its\r\nexistence in those countries, as owing to their communication with\r\nthe Arabs and Jews, without denying, however, that the prevalence of\r\nthe disease may have been influenced by the peculiar constitution of\r\nSpain. Accordingly its dry and burning temperature has contributed\r\nconsiderably, as it would appear, to locate this terrible disease,\r\nespecially in the kingdom of Andalusia, and in the principality of the\r\nAsturias. The use of pork and other salted provisions, so commonly\r\nemployed as articles of diet in ancient Spain, is supposed to have\r\nacted powerfully in perpetuating the disease, inasmuch as the opinions\r\nof Ubilis and other physicians go to show that these sorts of aliment\r\nare powerful generators of the malady. The first appearance of leprosy\r\nin Spain coincides with its introduction into Italy, after having been\r\nprevalent in the army of Pompey the Great about sixty years, more or\r\nless, before the coming of Christ. The sons of the celebrated general\r\nproceeded with the army of their father from Italy to Spain, to stem\r\nthe invasion of Cæsar, and this was in all probability the cause of its\r\nfirst introduction into that country,--at least, it is so considered by\r\nsome writers.\r\n\r\nAnno 49 B.C. The continued heavy rains and tempestuous\r\nseasons, the like of which had never been seen by the oldest\r\ninhabitants, caused frightful inundations of the rivers Cinca and\r\nSegre. Epidemic pestilence, peculiar to an atmosphere surcharged with\r\nmoisture and poisonous exhalations, appeared immediately after. The\r\nshepherds were obliged to withdraw their flocks in order to save them\r\nfrom the waters, which, together with the increased price of corn\r\nand of other food amongst the neighbouring populace, multiplied the\r\nmisfortunes of the army of Julius Cæsar, who had not only to combat\r\nagainst the bravery of the Pompeians, but also against the trials of\r\nfamine and pestilence. Their distress would have been greater and more\r\nlamentable, had not some of the neighbouring tribes, who had recently\r\nbecome their allies, succoured them with the necessaries of life, which\r\nwere sent in under the escort of 500 Ilecaones, a tribe who occupied\r\nthe banks of the Ebro.\r\n\r\nIn the time of Mark Antony, anno 30 B.C., a pestilence of so\r\ngeneral a character prevailed, that it seems to have spread over the\r\nwhole world. Dion Cassius mentions this pestilence, which continued for\r\nfive years, destroying vast numbers of the inhabitants of Jerusalem:\r\nit was also very destructive at Rome and in Palestine. The celebrated\r\ntriumvir died about this period of the pestilence, as mentioned by\r\nNuestro Alonso of Freylas in his ‘History of Pestilences.’\r\n\r\nThe next account of epidemic pestilence we have, is given by Tacitus,\r\nwho relates that in the East, in Asia Minor, fourteen years after the\r\ncommencement of the Christian era, pestilence prevailed; a severe\r\nearthquake about this time was experienced; a comet is also mentioned\r\nas having been seen, whose tail, it is said, with one fell swoop\r\nhurled down a dozen cities at once. Another pestilence is recorded by\r\nSuetonius as having raged with great mortality at Babylon: it caused a\r\nmultitude of Jews to remove to Seleucia. This year was marked by great\r\nfamine, in fulfilment of the prophecy of Agabus (Acts xi. 28). During\r\nthe reign of Claudius Cæsar, at this period, pestilence was rife in\r\nGreece and Italy.\r\n\r\nPliny and Tacitus both give an account of those periods of mortality\r\nfrom the year of our Lord 40 to 53 and 54, when most of the officers\r\nof Rome died of pestilential disease: “ex omnium magistratuum genere\r\nplerique mortem obierunt.” It was during the year 40 that the great\r\neruption of Etna occurred, which frightened Caligula from Sicily.\r\nDire famine was also experienced, which, with pestilence, extended\r\nfrom Italy almost to India. Babylon was almost depopulated about\r\nthis period.--A.D. 88, pestilence carried off 30,000 of the\r\npeople of Rome. Tacitus gives an affecting account of the ravages of\r\nthis plague. The houses were filled with dead bodies, and the streets\r\nwith funerals; neither age, sex, nor condition were exempted from\r\nit; slaves and plebeians were suddenly carried off by it amidst the\r\nlamentations of their wives and their children, who were also seized\r\nwith the disease while administering to the sick and mourning over the\r\nlifeless bodies of the dead. Pliny, Orosius, and other writers describe\r\nthis pestilential period as exceedingly fatal. Earthquakes, eruptions\r\nof volcanoes emitting sulphureous vapours, inundations, tempestuous\r\nseasons, and other awful commotions of nature, characterized this\r\nperiod all over the inhabited globe. In June, a comet appeared; on\r\nthe 1st of November following, a tremendous ebullition of burning\r\nlava issued from the crater of Vesuvius, deluging the country, and\r\nHerculaneum and Pompeii sunk in a moment: these cities, with their\r\ninhabitants, were buried in one universal mass. Thunder and lightning\r\npierced the heavens, and the ashes and smoke from the burning gulf\r\ndischarged into the air were wafted to Rome, Syria, and Africa, the\r\ninhabitants whereof trembled lest the world should be destroyed or\r\nturned into chaos; the fish in the neighbouring seas were killed.\r\nThese calamities were preceded by a long drought in Italy during the\r\nsummer; and in the autumn of A.D. 80 a terrible pestilence\r\nbroke out in Rome, and destroyed for some time 10,000 citizens daily.\r\nEight years after, A.D. 88, an epidemic pestilence appeared in\r\nthe north of England, and continued for some time; in 92, it carried\r\noff 150,000 persons in Scotland.\r\n\r\nPhilo, the Jewish philosopher, gives a description of a ‘loimic’\r\npestilence which occurred during that century, and appositely conveys\r\nthe mode of diffusion and the circumstances of the confluent small-pox.\r\nHe says, “The clouds of dust suddenly falling on men and cattle\r\nproduced over the whole skin a severe and intractable ulceration; the\r\nbody immediately became tumid with efflorescences (ἐξανθήσεσιν) or\r\npurulent phlyctenæ, which appeared like blisters excited by a secret\r\nfire beneath. Men necessarily undergoing much pain and universal\r\nsoreness from ulceration and inflammation (φλογώσεως) suffered not\r\nless in body than in mind by the severe affliction, for a continuous\r\nulcer was observable from head to foot.” These observations of Philo\r\nare intended as a comment on Exodus, ch. ix. v. 9: it shall be “a boil\r\nbreaking forth with blains.” He finishes by observing, that it should\r\nrank among pestilential diseases (ἐν τοῖς λοιμώδεσι νόσοις), or as\r\nthe infliction of a tainted atmosphere (πληγὴ ἀπ’ ἀέρος καὶ οὐρανοῦ).\r\nFrom a passage in Dion Cassius’ Roman History, it would appear that\r\nsome mode of inoculation had been attempted in the reign of Domitian,\r\nA.D. 92, and revived in that of Commodus.\r\n\r\nA.D. 110, a severe earthquake was felt in Shropshire, in\r\nEngland. Four years after, 114, a similar shock, but more extensive,\r\nwas experienced in China, which caused the destruction of much property\r\nand of many lives. During the same period a pestilence prevailed in\r\nWales, which carried off 45,000 of its inhabitants, after a hot summer\r\nand an inclement autumn. In fact, in those days there frequently\r\nhappened great inundations, especially of the river Severn: at one time\r\nimmense numbers were drowned in their beds, when 5000 head of cattle\r\nwere destroyed. A.D. 115, a tremendous earthquake laid waste\r\nthe city of Antioch. Five years after, A.D. 120, Nicomedia and\r\nseveral neighbouring cities were swallowed up; and, A.D. 128,\r\nCæsarea and Necropolis met with a similar fate from a severe earthquake.\r\n\r\nA.D. 133, a great drought existed in England, and the Thames\r\nwas almost dried up. This condition of the seasons was followed by\r\npestilence; and thirteen years after, Scotland was visited with an\r\nepidemic, to the great destruction of its inhabitants.\r\n\r\nArabia was ravaged by pestilence in the year of our Lord 158. The\r\ndisease appeared in Rome during the reign of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus\r\nand Lucius Verus, preceded by a more destructive plague in Asia, which\r\nthe great Ammianus Marcellinus, the philosophic hero, asserted arose\r\nfrom the foul air of a small box which a Roman soldier had opened\r\nat the capture of Seleucia. This opinion was in accordance with the\r\nsuperstition of the times. At that period the elements were greatly\r\nderanged: commotions of the physical world, inundations of rivers,\r\nagitations of the earth, devastations from locusts, caterpillars,\r\nand every variety of the insect tribe, famine, putrid vapours, with\r\ngreat inclemencies and irregularities of the seasons, foretold the\r\napproach of the awful pestilence which in the same year desolated Rome:\r\nits symptoms were, a burning fever and gangrene of the extremities,\r\nparticularly of the feet. These times were also distinguished by wars\r\nand rumours of wars: 450,000 Romans were butchered in Syria and in\r\nCyprus by the Jews. Fourteen cities were destroyed by earthquakes,\r\namongst which was Antioch, with 100,000 inhabitants: 580,000 were\r\nsupposed altogether to have perished by the sword, famine, and\r\npestilence.\r\n\r\nAurelius Victor, speaking of the emperor M. Antoninus, gives a lucid\r\ndescription of those calamitous times. He says, “Unless he had been\r\nborn for these times, all the affairs of the Roman empire would have\r\nbeen ruined assuredly as if by one fall; for there was rest no where\r\nfrom arms, and wars burned through all the East, Illyricum, Italy, and\r\nGaul. The motions of the earth, with annihilation of cities, inundation\r\nof the rivers, thick pestilences, species of locusts infested the\r\nfields; indeed, nothing can be said or conceived, by which mortals used\r\nto be wasted with the severest agonies, which have not raged during his\r\nadministration.”\r\n\r\nA.D. 173, there was a severe winter, and consequently a famine\r\nin England; a pestilence broke out the summer following, and continued\r\nto the autumn and subsequent winter. In this year, as also in 175 and\r\n178, Rome was visited by epidemic pestilence, which committed great\r\nravages among the soldiery. Five years after, it was again afflicted\r\nwith disease; and in A.D. 195, plague prevailed in all Italy.\r\n“A great pestilence,” says the historian, “raged in all Italy, and\r\nbecame most violent in Rome by reason of the great concourse of people\r\nassembled from all quarters of the world. The emperor, by the advice of\r\nhis physicians, retired to Laurentum, a cool place beautifully shaded\r\nwith laurels, on the supposition that the sweet smell of those plants\r\ncounteracted contagion. The people of the city were also advised by the\r\nphysicians to fill their noses and ears with sweet-smelling ointments,\r\nand to use perfumes, in order to prevent the action of human effluvia\r\nand of the contagious air. These precautions, however, as might\r\nhave been expected, proved of little avail: the distemper proceeded\r\nunchecked, and men and cattle continued to perish therefrom in\r\nmultitudes. Five thousand died daily in Rome for a considerable time,\r\nand famine with pestilence persisted for three years.” (See Herodian,\r\nDion Cassius, &c.)\r\n\r\nA.D. 203, there was an eruption of Mount Vesuvius.\r\n\r\nIn the year 211, a plague, preceded by an earthquake and a great\r\ninundation of the river Trent, appeared in the British Isles.\r\nA.D. 218, the river Tweed overflowed; and dire pestilence\r\nfollowed four years after, destroying 100,000 lives in Scotland.\r\n\r\nMortal pestilence affected the whole world A.D. 250. Italy,\r\nEthiopia, Egypt, Asia, France, Spain, and various other parts suffered\r\ngreat ravages from disease. “For twelve years subsequently,” says\r\nZosimus, “a pestilential fever followed the Scythians, and devoured the\r\nscanty remains of the human race.” “Pestilence has contaminated the\r\nface of the earth,” says Jornandes, a learned historian.\r\n\r\nA.D. 252, Alexandria and other districts suffered from\r\nepidemic pestilence, which continued its ravages with great fury\r\nfor twelve or fifteen years. This pestilence was not, however, one\r\nuniform disorder, but was comprised of several different kinds, such\r\nas dysentery, ignis sacer, or scurvy, typhomania, remittent fevers,\r\n&c. According to Cedrenus, there were at the time singular exhalations\r\nand dews, which resembled the ichors of dead bodies: “hence,” he says,\r\n“constant loimoi, with other severe and unmanageable disorders (βαρέα\r\nκαὶ ἀνίατα νοσήματα), which destroyed multitudes of the people.”\r\n\r\nA.D. 262. During the reign of Gallienus 5000 citizens of Rome\r\nperished daily. Cyprian, a bishop of Carthage, a man of erudition (see\r\nreprint, Fell, fol. Oxon. Amst. 1700), in detailing the symptoms of\r\nthis horrific pestilence, thus writes: “The symptoms were, a dejection\r\nof spirits, exhaustion of strength, incessant involuntary evacuations,\r\nviolent fever of the bowels, with destruction of the sight, hearing,\r\nand feeling.” Aurelius Victor asserts of this pestilence, that it\r\nspread rapidly all over Rome, and arose from heavy cares and depression\r\nof mind, as well as from a pestiferous state of the atmosphere. We may\r\nhere recognize all the terrible symptoms of that devastating disease\r\nCholera, which, beginning in the year 1817, ravaged the four quarters\r\nof the globe, and continued for a series of years. Several earthquakes\r\nwere experienced this year in Europe, Asia, and Africa, with three\r\ndays’ darkness. A.D. 272, there was another eruption of\r\nVesuvius.\r\n\r\nA.D. 292, pestilence and famine prevailed in England\r\nand Wales; it also raged with great intensity in those places,\r\nA.D. 310, carrying off, in the latter, 40,000 persons.\r\n\r\nA.D. 302, epidemic pestilence (_loimos_), preceded by\r\nfamine, broke out in Syria. The account of this pestilential disorder\r\nby George Cedrenus appears to be similar to that by Eusebius; he\r\nsays: “At this time almost every evil that can be enumerated fell\r\nupon men--famine, loimos, and drought, with misfortune of a certain\r\ndisorder; it was an ulcer, the denomination of which was answerable to\r\nits affinity with the fiery anthrax, spreading over the whole body: it\r\nproved highly dangerous in all respects to the persons affected, but\r\nby a particular determination to the eyes in most cases, it produced\r\nblindness in thousands of men, women, and children.” Nicephorus says of\r\nthis disease--“It originated in famine, and was called anthrax; it was\r\nan ulceration attracting or draining out humours, with an intolerable\r\nstench, which, in spreading over the bodies, extended to and affected\r\nwith violence the eyelids (κανθοὶ), and occasioned blindness both in\r\nmales and females.” We are further informed by Eusebius and Cedrenus\r\nthat the army of Gallienus, in Armenia, was affected with pestilence,\r\nwhich extended to every city in the eastern provinces, and even to\r\nvillages and lone houses. The great mortality among the poor was\r\nattributable more to famine than to the disease; they were obliged to\r\neat hay, grass, roots, &c. The rich, however, were not exempt from this\r\npestilence, but were also carried off in great numbers. The emperor\r\nDiocletian, according to Cedrenus, died of the malady: “he was affected\r\nwith severe pains over the whole body,--a violent phlogosis preyed upon\r\nhis inward parts, and his flesh melted like wax. In the progress of the\r\ncomplaint, he became totally blind; his throat and tongue putrefied,\r\nso that worms came from his mouth, and he emitted an odour not less\r\noffensive than that of dead bodies in the sepulchres.” This malady was\r\nevidently confluent small-pox.\r\n\r\nA.D. 325, epidemic pestilence, preceded by famine, prevailed\r\nall over Britain, and in many other parts of the world. During the\r\nyears 336, 355, 358, 362, 367, 368, and 375, deadly disease, with\r\nfamine and earthquakes, were again experienced in the British Isles. In\r\nWales alone, in the latter year, 43,000 persons died from pestilence.\r\nA terrible earthquake was felt in Macedonia, and 150 cities were\r\nswallowed up in Asia and Greece. Ammianus Marcellinus mentions a plague\r\nwhich broke out in Amida, a city of Persia, during its siege by Sapor,\r\nwhich was attributed to the distresses of war, and to the corruption of\r\nunburied bodies lying about in the streets, plains, &c.\r\n\r\nA.D. 361, there was a terrible famine in Italy. Four years\r\nafter, 365, severe shocks of an earthquake, with inundations round\r\nthe Mediterranean, did much damage. 50,000 persons were drowned at\r\nAlexandria in the month of July. Italy and Syria suffered from plague,\r\nwhich continued until 394. An inundation of the Nile nearly destroyed\r\nthe cities of Alexandria and Libya; and rain, storms, and drought\r\nwere experienced in Judea, which was also visited by immense swarms\r\nof locusts. These phenomena were succeeded by dire pestilence. There\r\nwere several earthquakes at intervals between the months of September\r\nand November, which destroyed many places in Europe. During the years\r\n400, 407, 417, and 419, pestilence desolated Asia, Africa, and Europe;\r\na severe earthquake shook Cibyra, and destroyed many villages in its\r\nneighbourhood: in 419, an earthquake swallowed up several cities in\r\nPalestine. A.D. 442, pestilence swept away great numbers in\r\nEngland this year. A.D. 446, on the 17th of September, at\r\nConstantinople, a severe earthquake, attended with fire, pestilence,\r\nand famine, caused great misery. The walls of the town with seventeen\r\ntowers were thrown down. A.D. 458, an earthquake destroyed\r\nnearly all Antioch on the 14th of September. Pestilence, about the same\r\nperiod, again broke out in England, and in various other regions, as\r\nrelated by Echard. The Greek ecclesiastical historian Nicephorus, and\r\nother writers, state that it prevailed more remarkably in Cappadocia,\r\nGalatia, and Phrygia. Isodorus tells us that so great were the famine\r\nand disease in Spain, in A.D. 443, that men fed with fury upon\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nFrom the year 450 until 467, pestilence raged in Rome; it revisited\r\nthe city A.D. 473. The year previously, 472, on the 11th\r\nof November, at noon, there occurred an eruption of Vesuvius, which\r\nejected flames that were seen at Constantinople, obscured the sun at\r\nnoon day, and ravaged all Campania: there were ashes four inches deep\r\non the tops of houses many miles distant. A.D. 480, a severe\r\nearthquake was experienced at Constantinople, which lasted forty days,\r\ncausing much destruction of life and property. Epidemic pestilence\r\ninfested Scotland; and Asia and Africa were nearly depopulated by\r\nepidemic disease.\r\n\r\nA.D. 502, Scotland was visited by epidemic disease, which\r\ndestroyed both men and beasts. A.D. 512, there was an eruption\r\nof Vesuvius. A.D. 517, Palestine suffered from pestilence,\r\nas did the inhabitants of Wales ten years after, in 527. The year\r\nprevious, 526, Antioch with several other cities was nearly destroyed\r\nby an earthquake; it also suffered from a similar visitation two years\r\nafter, 528, when 4800 of its inhabitants were buried in its ruins.\r\n\r\nA.D. 540, so dire a famine was experienced in Italy, that\r\nparents were reduced to the cruel necessity of eating their children.\r\nAbout the same period, during the reign of Justinian, a destructive\r\npestilence ravaged the greater part of Europe and Asia for more than\r\nhalf a century. It was at first observed to be plague in its usual\r\nform only, attended with tumours in the groin or axillæ, or behind the\r\nears; but in its progress it was found to consist of various disorders,\r\ncorresponding, in their leading features, according to the description\r\nby Evagrius, to “the true pestilence.” These disorders consisted of\r\npestilential or scarlet sore throat, and dysentery, with small-pox and\r\nmeasles. This fatal epidemic is shown to have continued in Asia until\r\nthe year 590. Some authors have computed the number destroyed during\r\nthis pestilential period at two millions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n                        FROM A.D. 543 TO 1330.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 543, there was a terrible famine, during which, Procopius\r\nsays, 50,000 labourers died of hunger in the narrow region of Picenum,\r\nand a still greater number in the southern provinces. In one place,\r\nseventeen travellers were lodged; they were murdered and eaten: two\r\nwomen who were detected in the commission of this atrocious crime\r\nwere slain. Earthquakes were experienced all over the world. In 544,\r\ndysentery, which continued until 548, similating in severity the true\r\nplague, committed great ravages in France.\r\n\r\nA.D. 552, a severe earthquake was experienced at\r\nConstantinople, doing much damage. Nine years after, 561, a similar\r\nshock was felt at Rome, and also at Constantinople. The year following\r\nthere was so great a frost that the Danube was frozen over.\r\n\r\nFrance, Germany, Italy, and various other countries of Europe,--in\r\nfact, the whole inhabited globe,--suffered awfully from pestilence in\r\nthe years of our Lord 565–66, 583, 587, 589–90–91, 596 to 610: in the\r\ncourse of 580, Antioch was again shaken by a severe earthquake. There\r\nprevailed during this period, in the year 589, in Spain, writes St.\r\nGregory, bishop of Tours, a very singular pestilence, the principal\r\nsymptoms of which were pimples, or pustules, with buboes in the groins:\r\nsuch great havoc did it make, that the houses were as so many tombs,\r\nand the town as one vast cemetery: it was supposed that this disease\r\nwas brought from Marseilles in a vessel, as it had raged there the\r\nyear previously. St. Gregory, in his ‘History of the Franks,’ also\r\ngives these particulars of this pestilential period: “In the fifth year\r\nof the reign of king Childebert (A.D. 580), great floods,\r\ntempests, earthquakes, hail, and several prodigies, were succeeded by\r\na dreadful plague; for almost every district of France was occupied\r\nby a dysentery, in which the patients were affected with violent\r\nvomitings, fever, headache, and excruciating pains in the loins:\r\nwhat they discharged from their mouths was green or yellowish.” This\r\nepidemic was particularly fatal to infants and children: “Parvulos\r\nadolescentes arripuit letoque subegit: perdidimus dulces et charos\r\nnobis infantulos,” &c. King Childebert recovered with difficulty, but\r\nhe lost his two sons. Austrigilda, queen of Orleans, sunk under the\r\ndisease; she retained to the last the ferocious and vindictive spirit\r\nof the times, having exacted a promise from the king Gunthran that her\r\ntwo physicians should be put to death if they did not save her; soon\r\nafter she expired, both of them were stabbed by the king’s order. The\r\nCount d’Angoulême also died of the pestilence; the corpse appeared\r\nblack and charred, as if it had been laid over coals of fire.\r\n\r\nPaulus Diaconus describes the Ligurian pestilence which raged during\r\nthis period, A.D. 566, in the time of Narses: “Cœperunt nasci\r\ninguinibus hominum vel in aliis delicatioribus locis glandulæ in modum\r\nnucis seu dactyli, quas mox sequebatur febrium intolerabilis æstus, ita\r\nin triduo homo extingueretur: sin vero aliquis triduum transegisset,\r\nhabebat spem vivendi. Erat autem ubique luctus, ubique lacrymæ,” &c.\r\nHe concludes with the following passages: “Nulla vox in rure, nullus\r\npastorum sibilus, nullæ insidiæ bestiarum in pecudibus, nulla damna\r\nin dominos volucribus. Sata transgressa metendi tempus, intacta\r\nexpectabant messorem: vinea amissis foliis, radiantibus uvis, illæsa\r\nmanebat. Nulla erant vestigia commeantium; nullus cernebatur percussor,\r\net tamen visum oculorum superabant cadavera mortuorum. Pastoralia loca\r\nversa fuerunt in sepulturam hominum, et habitacula humana facta fuerunt\r\nconfugia bestiarum.”\r\n\r\nProcopius, a Greek historian of Cæsarea, secretary to Belisarius, a\r\ngeneral during the reign of Justinian, records some important facts\r\nof this pestilence, which ravaged the whole world; it lasted four\r\nmonths at Constantinople, and, when at its height, it is supposed that\r\n10,000 perished daily in that city. Nicephorus also describes this\r\npestilential period, and remarks that “certain little marks appeared\r\non the doors and outside of their houses, on their garments, and on\r\ntheir utensils; some white crusts of a peculiar deposition from the air\r\nadhered to all things, as damp moulds do on the walls or dwellings, and\r\ndew on grass.”\r\n\r\nIn the year 590, at Rome, in the time of Pope Pelagius the Second,\r\nthere was a horribly destructive pestilence prevalent, and also in\r\nSpain. The air was observed to be impregnated with a kind of mist and\r\nfœtidness, which by irritation induced a sneezing; hence the custom\r\nof saluting a person sneezing with the expression “Dominus tecum,” or\r\nsome similar expression, a practice which has reached our time. The\r\nyear following, 591, Britain suffered from a severe pestilence, also\r\nTurenne, and the provinces of Arragon and Vivares. This disease was\r\ncalled _inguinaria_, because buboes were formed more particularly\r\nin the groin. In the year 610, pestilential small-pox committed great\r\nravages at Mecca.\r\n\r\nA.D. 614, epidemic elephantiasis prevailed in Italy, and three\r\nyears subsequently, an epidemic pestilence, resembling the true plague.\r\n\r\nIn Syria, Arabia, &c., a great pestilence prevailed A.D. 639\r\nand 640.\r\n\r\nA.D. 654, Constantinople was devastated by a severe pestilence.\r\n\r\nIn the year of our Lord 664, a sudden pestilence (man-cyalm), after\r\ndepopulating the southern coasts of Britain, infected the provinces of\r\nthe Northumbrians, and, spreading for a long time in every direction,\r\ndestroyed great numbers. The year following, 665, it reached Italy,\r\ncausing great destruction of life. Fordum (Scriptores, xv. vol. iii.\r\npage 646) cites a Greek historian to the effect that dire mortality\r\nprevailed, A.D. 669, all over Europe, which did not spare the\r\nremotest islands, Great Britain and Ireland. England also suffered\r\ngreatly, A.D. 672, from pestilence, at which period universal\r\ndisease appeared in Syria and Mesopotamia. England and Ireland were\r\nrevisited by pestilence, A.D. 679, beginning in the month of\r\nJuly, and continuing until the end of September. Rome suffered from\r\nsimilar ravages the following year, and in A.D. 683, England\r\nagain suffered from severe epidemic disease, which lasted three years.\r\nA.D. 685, Syria and Libya were laid waste by disease. Ireland\r\nsuffered from a severe epidemic the same year.\r\n\r\nFrom a singular portion of history which has been preserved in the\r\nrecords of the church of Mayo, we find that the ‘ignis sacer,’ or\r\npestilence originating from famine, was similar to and contemporary\r\nwith the pestilence ‘man-cyalm,’ which raged among the British after\r\nthe departure of the Romans from Britain (664).\r\n\r\nAccording to the records, two kings of Erin summoned the principal\r\nclergy and laity to a council at Temora, in consequence of a general\r\ndearth, the land not being sufficient to support the increasing\r\npopulation. The chiefs (majores populi) decreed that a fast should be\r\nobserved both by clergy and laity, so that they might with one accord\r\n_solicit God in prayer to remove by some species of pestilence the\r\nburthensome multitudes of the inferior people_, and thus enable the\r\nresidue to subsist more commodiously. “Omnes majores petebant ut nimia\r\nmultitudo vulgi per infirmitatem aliquam tolleretur, quia numerositas\r\npopuli erat occasio famis.” St. Gerald and his associates suggested\r\nthat it would be more conformable to the Divine Nature, and not more\r\ndifficult, to multiply the fruits of the earth, than to destroy its\r\ninhabitants. An amendment was accordingly moved, “to supplicate the\r\nAlmighty not to reduce the number of the men till it answered the\r\nquantity of corn usually produced, but to increase the produce of the\r\nland, so that it might satisfy the wants of the people.” However, the\r\nnobles and clergy, headed by St. Fechin, bore down the opposition, and\r\ncalled for a pestilence on the lower orders of the people. According to\r\nthe records, God’s judgment immediately fell upon the wicked authors\r\nof the petition. The two kings who had summoned the convention with\r\nSt. Fechin, the kings of Ulster and Munster, and a third of the nobles\r\nconcerned, were cut off by the pestilence--‘Budhe connail,’ which was\r\nby some called ‘pestis flava,’ by others ‘infirmitas icteritia.’\r\n\r\nA.D. 685, there happened an eruption of Vesuvius.\r\n\r\nIn the year of our Lord 690, rains deluged Italy: six years after, 696,\r\npestilence prevailed in Constantinople, and during the years 703 and\r\n713, Scotland also suffered from epidemic pestilence. Small-pox caused\r\ngreat mortality in Spain, A.D. 714.\r\n\r\nA.D. 717, 30,000 persons were carried off at Constantinople by\r\npestilence: it again appeared in the years 724 and 729. In the year 732\r\ngreat numbers perished from pestilential disease at Norwich in England,\r\nand also in Syria.\r\n\r\nA.D. 740, the world was again visited by dismal pestilence,\r\nwhich continued, with varied intensity, for 260 years, until the year\r\n1000. During this period, 749, an earthquake destroyed many cities in\r\nSyria. Among the many writers on the subject, Baronius, P. Diaconus,\r\nCedrenus, and Magdenburgh, make mention of an epidemic pestilence\r\nwhich raged in Calabria, in Naples, also in Constantinople; in which\r\nlatter place the mortality was so great, that the living were unable to\r\nbury their dead, cart-loads being huddled together into a vast common\r\nexcavation of the earth, while great numbers were left unburied. Short\r\nmentions the prevalence of a fatal pestilence in Wales, A.D.\r\n762, which afterwards extended all over England, continuing until\r\n771. In Chichester alone it is stated that 34,000 persons perished.\r\nPestilence raged in France A.D. 779, and invaded Scotland\r\n784. Lancisius and Bartianus in their Annals relate the occurrence of\r\ndisease in various parts of the world, which destroyed immense numbers\r\nof cattle, especially in Germany, where the mortality was great among\r\nthe horned tribe. A.D. 801, St. Paul’s at Rome was thrown down\r\nin the month of April; and in France, Germany, and in various parts of\r\nItaly also, a severe earthquake was experienced. So intensely cold was\r\nit in A.D. 806, that the Rhone was frozen over: the cold was\r\nfrom 18 to 20 degrees centigrade below zero. Lancisius and Bartianus\r\nalso give an account of a pestilence that arose from excessive rains\r\nand cold damp weather, A.D. 817 and 820, and prevailed through\r\nall the dominions of Gaul. The crops failed from excess of moisture,\r\nand famine ensued. The following winter was very severe: the Rhine and\r\nthe Danube continued one solid body of ice for _thirty days_,\r\nand epidemic pestilence ensued in the spring, which persisted all the\r\nsummer and autumn. The succeeding winter, in 822, was very severe: the\r\nsnow lay on the ground twenty-nine weeks, and caused great destruction\r\nto both men and beasts. A long drought followed in the summer, and\r\npestilence was the consequence: it was attended with such fatality,\r\nthat, A.D. 825, it killed almost all the inhabitants in France\r\nand Germany.\r\n\r\nIn the year 853, epidemic pestilence broke out in Scotland: two\r\nyears after, earthquakes and violent tempests were experienced; and\r\nin A.D. 856 there occurred an earthquake and a tremendous\r\ninundation of the Tiber, which were succeeded by severe epidemic\r\nsore throats, anginas, &c., as recorded by Baronius, Murator, Short,\r\nand Magdenburgh. A.D. 859, the Mediterranean was so frozen\r\nover, that carriages were driven on the Adriatic Sea. In 863,\r\nepidemic pestilence ravaged Scotland; and in the year 874, myriads\r\nof grasshoppers or locusts, of an immense size, with six feet and\r\ntwo teeth as hard as flint, overspread Gaul. They devoured every\r\ngreen thing, and were afterwards driven into the British Channel by a\r\nstrong east wind; their dead bodies were washed on shore, where they\r\nputrefied, and therefore were supposed to have caused the epidemic\r\npestilence, which destroyed a third part of the maritime inhabitants\r\nof Gaul. In 883, famine and pestilence afflicted Italy, and the year\r\nfollowing, pestilential disease raged at Oxford, which also affected\r\nthe cattle, destroying great numbers. Soon after this period, when\r\nAlfred the Great had just finished the rebuilding of London, which\r\nhad been burnt and destroyed by the Danes, a plague occurred which\r\nraged throughout the land for three years, carrying off many great\r\nmen and ministers of state, as well as others. About the same time,\r\nA.D. 896, a mortal famine and pestilence, from intemperate\r\nseasons, happened in Gaul, Germany, Italy, and various other places\r\nin Europe. The frost, twelve years afterwards, A.D. 908,\r\nwas so severe, that most of the rivers in England were frozen over.\r\nA.D. 912, a great part of London was again destroyed by fire.\r\nA.D. 922, a pestilential fever was prevalent, and very fatal\r\nin Scotland.\r\n\r\nA.D. 929, the winter was severe. The Thames was frozen over\r\nfor thirteen weeks: a dreadful famine and disease followed; and in 937,\r\npestilence arising from great heat and long drought again raged for\r\nsome time in England.\r\n\r\nA.D. 940, epidemic pestilence of severe character appeared in\r\nthe north of Europe amongst the cattle, being fatal to numbers. This\r\nmurrain amongst the cattle was followed by disease in man, from which\r\nin Scotland alone 40,000 persons perished. In the year 964, the emperor\r\nOtho’s army was almost entirely destroyed by pestilence. A malignant\r\nfever or plague prevailed in London in 965, and a grievous famine\r\nhappened, in 976, in London, and also in Italy. In the year 981, great\r\nmortality prevailed amongst the Lacedemonians; and six years after,\r\n987, England suffered from malignant fevers, which destroyed many of\r\nits inhabitants, whilst a sort of flux caused great mortality among\r\nthe cattle. A.D. 993, there was an eruption of Vesuvius. In\r\n997, burning fevers and agues were fatal in England; and in the year\r\n1005, pestilence, in the shape of the true plague, began and continued\r\nfor three years in various parts of the globe, more than half the\r\nhuman race perishing therefrom. Thousands died from famine in Italy.\r\nA.D. 1007, another eruption of Vesuvius.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the great length of the pestilential period (260 years)\r\njust noticed, in A.D. 1009, the earth became deluged with\r\nrains and pestilence, which began among the Saxons. In the years 1012,\r\n1019, 1020, 1021, and 1024, dreadful pestilential seasons followed.\r\nA.D. 1017, it rained the colour of blood in Aquitaine for the\r\nspace of three days.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1025, the summer was wet and cold, and pestilence raged in\r\nEngland and in other parts of Europe.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1027, an extraordinary convulsive disease--which was\r\ncalled ‘the dance of St. John or St. Vitus,’ on account of the\r\nBacchantic leaps by which it was characterized, and which gave to\r\nthose affected, whilst performing their wild dance and screaming and\r\nfoaming with fury, all the appearance of persons possessed,--first\r\nshowed itself in some persons near the convent church of Kolbig, not\r\nfar from Bernburg. According to an oft-repeated tradition, eighteen\r\npeasants, some of whose names are still preserved, are said to have\r\ndisturbed divine service on Christmas eve, by dancing and brawling\r\nin the churchyard; whereupon the priest Ruprecht inflicted a curse\r\nupon them, that they should dance and scream for a whole year without\r\nceasing. This curse is said to have been completely fulfilled, so that\r\nthe unfortunate sufferers at length sunk knee-deep into the earth, and\r\nremained the whole time without nourishment, until they were finally\r\nreleased by the intercession of two pious bishops. It is said, that\r\nupon this they fell into a deep sleep, which lasted _three days_,\r\nand that four of them died, the rest continuing to suffer all their\r\nlives from a trembling of their limbs. This tradition, divested of the\r\nembellishments of crafty priesthood, will show the disease to have been\r\nwhat we now call Chorea or St. Vitus’ dance.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1029 and 1031, epidemic pestilence again pervaded Europe,\r\nespecially England and Gaul, after tempestuous seasons, devastations\r\nof locusts, meteors, eruptions of volcanoes, comets, intolerable\r\nvicissitudes of the weather, and famine had caused great havoc.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1033, a pestilence infested England; and two years afterwards,\r\n1035, in the month of June, so intense was the cold that all the corn\r\nand fruits were destroyed. There was another eruption of Vesuvius the\r\nyear following. A.D. 1042, it snowed heavily during harvest-time; it\r\nrained excessively throughout the year in many parts of Europe; the\r\nsea overwhelmed Flanders, and a terrible commotion of the elements\r\nwas the precursor of famine and pestilence in England, Gaul, Germany,\r\n&c.; cattle and men were equally destroyed. The following year, 1043,\r\nthere was another eruption of Vesuvius, and also one in A.D. 1048. A.D.\r\n1063 the river Thames was frozen over for fourteen weeks. Pestilential\r\ndiseases, such as fluxes, pleurisies, fevers, &c., carried off many\r\nhundred thousands of Saracens marching to invade Rome in the year 1064:\r\nthis pestilential epidemic continued until 1066. A.D. 1067, leprosy\r\nbeing on the increase in Spain, lazar-houses for the lepers were first\r\nestablished at Valencia by Ruy Diaz de Villar, which were called ‘Cid\r\nCunpandor.’ About this period an awful plague swept away a great part\r\nof the inhabitants of Egypt and Arabia. The following year, 1068, a\r\ngreat pestilence raged in York and Durham (in England), and a terrible\r\nplague devastated Constantinople. A.D. 1075, so intense was the cold\r\nthis year that the Thames was frozen over from the month of November\r\nuntil April the following year, 1076; with the exception of a very few\r\ndays, there was scarcely any thaw during all this period. A.D. 1077,\r\nLondon was nearly destroyed by fire. About this period, and two years\r\nafter, famine, pestilence, and locusts made great havoc in Italy,\r\nRussia, Flanders, and in England.\r\n\r\nIn the years 1087–88 and 1089, very rainy, cold summers and extreme\r\nwinters were experienced in England, Gaul, and Germany, when pestilence\r\nand famine did much mischief in those countries. There were also famine\r\nand epidemic disease in Italy. In the latter year, 1089, erysipelas\r\nprevailed epidemically in France, causing great mortality. A.D. 1090,\r\na terrible earthquake was felt throughout England, which was followed\r\nby a great scarcity of fruit and a late, unproductive harvest. The year\r\nfollowing, a severe storm was felt in several parts of England; the\r\nwind was at south-west, especially at Winchelscomb, Gloucestershire,\r\nwhere the steeple of the church was thrown down; there was much thunder\r\nand lightning; the crucifix with the image of the Virgin was broken\r\nin pieces. On the 5th of October, during the storm a thick mist for\r\nseveral hours darkened the sky. A few days after, on the 17th, a\r\nthunder-storm from the south-west destroyed upwards of 500 houses in\r\nLondon: it unroofed Bow church; and at Old Sarum the steeple was struck\r\ndown, with many dwelling-houses.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1093, a tremendous inundation occurred in Syria, by\r\nwhich prodigious numbers of the inhabitants and cattle, such as oxen\r\nand horses, were destroyed. A.D. 1096–97, 1100, 1103–4, and\r\n1105, pestilence and famine happened from unhealthy seasons; there\r\noccurred excessive rains, terrible inundations, severe winters,\r\ninclement summers, variable autumns, multitudes of worms (papiliones),\r\nand violent hurricanes in England, Palestine, and Holland, in which\r\nlatter place 100,000 persons were drowned by the inroads of the sea. It\r\nwas during this period, A.D. 1100, that the lands of Godwin,\r\nearl of Kent, to this day called the ‘Goodwin Sands,’ were inundated.\r\n1104, a comet was seen. The disease which prevailed in England was\r\nan erysipelatous epidemic fever, in which the limbs of the sick were\r\ndiscovered to be thickly beset with black and livid spots, like\r\ncarbuncles in the plague. Two years after, fevers, fluxes, &c., were\r\nrife, and pestilence continued to prevail in various parts of Europe\r\nin the years 1108–9, 1110–11. There appeared a comet in the years\r\n1107 and 1110. A.D. 1113, the water of the Medway failed so\r\ngreatly, that the smallest boats could not float in its channel. The\r\nThames about the same period was so low between the Tower and London\r\nBridge that women and children waded over. Owing to so great an ebb of\r\nthe ocean, the sands were laid bare for a whole day for several miles\r\nfrom the shore: pestilence ravaged Judea. A.D. 1116, severe\r\nearthquakes were experienced in the month of December in various parts\r\nof England, especially in Shropshire. Two years previously, 1114,\r\nseveral bridges, being built of wood, were broken down in England by\r\nthe ice, when it thawed after the severe frost.\r\n\r\nFrom the year 1120, a pestilential period equal in intensity and\r\ndestructiveness to that between the years 740 and 1000 (a period of\r\n260 years), preceded by famine, murrain, &c., commenced, and continued\r\nto ravage various parts of the globe until 1392 (272 years), a brief\r\nnotice of which, taken from the chronicles, will show its extent and\r\nfatality.\r\n\r\nFrom A.D. 1120 unto 1125, erysipelas raged epidemically\r\nwith great mortality in England, and it has been computed that, by\r\nit, a third of the population perished in those years. A.D.\r\n1126–27 and 1128 a destructive pestilence again prevailed in England.\r\nA.D. 1130, a severe earthquake was felt in Shropshire in the\r\nmonth of September. A.D. 1133, the Po was frozen over from\r\nCremona to the sea, and the year after, 1134, an earthquake occurred,\r\njust as King Henry was about to embark for Normandy, when flames of\r\nfire burst out of certain rifts of the earth with great violence. On\r\nthe 2nd of August there was an eruption of Vesuvius, A.D.\r\n1136, and the year following, a severe earthquake swallowed up the city\r\nof Catania, with more than 15,000 of the inhabitants. Dismal pestilence\r\noccurred again in England, lasting twelve years, from 1133 unto 1146;\r\nfamine also added to the miseries of the inhabitants, and much cattle\r\nwere destroyed by murrain, and for want of provender.\r\n\r\nFrom the year 1150 to 1169 severe winters and dry summers were\r\nexperienced; there were frequent inundations and earthquakes; and\r\nfamine and pestilence swept the world, especially Scotland, Ireland,\r\nItaly, Gaul, Sicily, Judea, Asia, and Africa. A.D. 1164,\r\nthere was a great inundation in Friesland, which covered nearly\r\nthe whole country, and destroyed vast numbers of the inhabitants.\r\nA.D. 1167, Henry II.’s palace in Dublin, at which he spent\r\nhis Christmas, was built of wattles, with a straw roof, and the sides\r\nformed of clay. A.D. 1172, great mortality from dysentery\r\nwas experienced in England; and two years after, small-pox, measles,\r\nepidemic catarrh, scarlet fever, quinsies, and pleurisies were greatly\r\nprevalent: similar maladies were rife in various other parts of the\r\nworld from 1175 to 1193. A.D. 1179, about Christmas, at a\r\nplace called Oxen-hall, near Darlington, in the bishopric of Durham,\r\nthe earth raised itself up like a lofty tower, and thus remained for\r\nseveral hours, when on a sudden it sunk down again with a horrid\r\nnoise, and formed a deep pit, which continues until this day: it is\r\nsupposed that the wells that are now called Hell-kettles were formed\r\nby this convulsion of nature. A.D. 1183 and following years,\r\na severe pestilence scourged England, and the plague raged at Rome.\r\nA.D. 1185, an earthquake overthrew the church at Lincoln;\r\nat the same time other places in the neighbourhood suffered from the\r\nshock. Castile, and principally the city of Leon, suffered from a most\r\ncruel plague which spared neither sex nor grade, visiting palaces as\r\nwell as the hovels of the poor. Many of the bishops were carried off.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1190. The old chronicler Geoffrey de Vinsauf describes a\r\nterrible famine and pestilence that happened in 1190, “in the army of\r\nthe Crusaders at the siege of Acre, owing to the villany of the Marquis\r\nof Montferrat, the governor of Tyre, who not only refused to supply\r\nthe soldiers with food, but would not either allow of the townsfolk to\r\nsend them provisions.” So great was the famine and the scarcity, that\r\n“a moderate measure of wheat which a man could carry under his arm\r\nwas sold for 100 aurei, a chicken for twelve sols, and an egg for six\r\ndeniers. The men were reduced to feed on their horses, which they were\r\ncompelled to kill, not even the entrails being rejected. Men of high\r\nrank and the sons of great men fed upon grass even; and herbs such as\r\nthey once despised and believed not fit for human use, the greatness\r\nof the famine made now most sweet to the starving. The public ovens\r\nwere constantly occupied by men fighting for the bread, and noblemen,\r\nsuffering from the pangs of hunger, became thieves and stole the loaves\r\nfrom the bakers’ shops.” To add to their misery, heavy rains fell, and\r\npestilence broke out amongst them, so that a thousand deaths happened\r\ndaily. De Vinsauf says, “The unusual showers, by their constant and\r\ncontinuous fall, had such an injurious effect upon the soldiers, that,\r\nwith the excess of the affliction, their limbs becoming swollen, the\r\nwhole body was affected as with the dropsy, and from the violence of\r\nthe disease the teeth of some of them were loosened and fell out.”\r\nBut few of those attacked recovered. Every section of this old work,\r\ndescriptive of this pestilence, ends with a fierce imprecation on the\r\nMarquis for his desertion and perfidy.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1193 and 1194, there was a famine in Italy, and\r\npestilence swept England, continuing till 1196. “The common people\r\nperished in every quarter for lack of food, and the fiercest pestilence\r\nfollowed, in the form of acute fever, which destroyed such numbers that\r\nscarcely any were left to minister unto the sick; the customary funeral\r\nservice ceased, and in many places large ditches were made, into which\r\nthe dead were thrown.”--(Chron. W. Humford, vol. ii. p. 546–7.) There\r\nwas, A.D. 1196, a great famine and plague in the principality\r\nof Catalonia, and 1199, pestilential fever raged at Cordova, in which\r\nthe celebrated physician Averrhoes observed that every patient who was\r\nbled before purging invariably died.\r\n\r\nEngland again suffered severely from epidemic pestilence in the year\r\n1200, and also in the following year. A.D. 1205, a severe\r\nfrost was experienced in England from the 14th of January unto the 22nd\r\nof March.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1206, on the last day of the month of February, there\r\nwas an eclipse of the sun, which lasted six hours--the darkness was\r\nas great as at midnight. This phenomenon was followed by abundant and\r\ncontinued rains, inundations, and severe epidemic pestilence in Spain.\r\n\r\nThe years 1210–1213, 1217, 1218, and 1220, were marked by ordinary\r\nseasons, except in Spain, Italy, and Friesland. In the former place,\r\nSpain, 1217, the drought was so great as not only to destroy the\r\nharvests, but the pasture had the appearance of having been burnt\r\nup; famine was the consequence, with disease both in men and cattle.\r\nIn Italy the plague, it is said, scarcely left a tenth part of the\r\ninhabitants alive, and in Damietta it is asserted that only three\r\npersons out of 70,000 survived. In Friesland, A.D. 1218,\r\nthere was an inundation which destroyed cattle, houses, and many\r\npersons. In 1221, excessive rains, floods, frosts, and inclement heats\r\ninduced a famine and pestilence, which almost desolated the whole of\r\nEurope; in some countries, the living were exhausted burying the dead,\r\nand in some cities scarcely a person survived the terrible destruction.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1222, there was a severe thunder-storm in England with\r\nlightning, which destroyed several churches; the summer was excessively\r\ndry; frost and deep snow in April had destroyed the blossoms of the\r\nfruits; the country was deluged with rains in autumn, and swept with\r\ntempestuous winds; and the plague raged with uncontrollable fury in\r\nGermany, Hungary, Gaul, Egypt, and other countries: the animals also\r\nsuffered from disease. The winter of 1225 was rigorous, following the\r\ngreat drought. In 1224 a dearth ensued, and there was a great mortality\r\namong sheep.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1228, abundant rains, followed by a hot summer, the\r\nsubsequent winter being a severe one, induced fatal disease, and an\r\ninundation at Friesland destroyed 100,000 persons.\r\n\r\nThe inundation of the Tiber, which happened A.D. 1230, drowned\r\nall the lower city of Rome, the river rising even to the stairs of\r\nSt. Peter’s church: July and August following were exceedingly hot;\r\nfamine ensued, and afterwards pestilence commenced and continued until\r\nA.D. 1235. England suffered also from pestilence, which\r\ndecimated the population; in that year 20,000 persons, it is supposed,\r\ndied of starvation alone in London. About this period, leprosy\r\nbecame so common in England that it was made the subject of several\r\nlegislative enactments.\r\n\r\nDuring this year, 1230, when King Don Jayme seized on the island of\r\nMallorca, a frightful and lethal pestilence prevailed not only among\r\nthe poor and wretched, but also among the higher orders; in the course\r\nof only one month, several nobles and individuals of the first families\r\nof Aragon and Catalonia died. The desolation which this dire pestilence\r\ncaused was such that it almost depopulated the island, and forced the\r\nking to send galleys to Catalonia in search of colonists, he having\r\ngiven an order to Don Pedro Cornel for 100,000 reals to bring from\r\nAragon 150 gentry,--caballeros or nobles. This pestilence increased\r\nwith another no less fatal disease, viz., ‘the Sacred Persian or St.\r\nAnthony’s fire;’ so that this great monarch, anxious for the safety of\r\nhis people, established in the island, by his mandate of 13th September\r\nof the same year, the hospital of St. Anthony for the reception and\r\ntreatment of all suffering from so terrible a malady, as appears in\r\nthe history of the kingdom of Mallorca written by the chronicler or\r\nhistorian Don Vincente Mut. In imitation of this establishment, and of\r\nthat founded in Castro Xerez in 1214, other hospitals were erected for\r\nthe same purposes in Madrid, Saragossa, and in various other provinces\r\nof the kingdom. Twenty-three years after, another hospital, called\r\nafter St. Lazarus, was established in the city of Seville, similar to\r\nthat which was built in the city of Valencia in the year 1067. The\r\nAnnals of Seville, written by Zurita and Don Alonso Melgado, state\r\nthat this hospital was founded by King Alonso the Wise. About this\r\ntime, 1230, Denmark, Italy, and Gaul were visited by a severe epidemic\r\npestilence, as also were various other parts of Europe; it continued\r\nuntil 1236.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1233 it thundered and lightened for thirteen days, with\r\nheavy rains, which destroyed all vegetation in England, when famine\r\nand disease were the consequences. At this time most of the houses in\r\nLondon were built of wood and wattles, and thatched with straw; the\r\nwindows were without glass, and there were neither chimneys nor boarded\r\nfloors; common straw was used for the king’s bed. The Mediterranean\r\nwas frozen over; loaded waggons also crossed the Adriatic in front of\r\nVenice. A.D. 1234 and the year following, 1235, the Thames\r\nrose so high at Westminster, that the lawyers and other members of the\r\ncourt were brought out of the Hall in boats. A.D. 1237, the\r\ndancing disease, similar to that which was rife A.D. 1027 at\r\nKolbig, broke out amongst upwards of 100 children at Erfurt; they were\r\nsaid to have been suddenly seized with this singular malady, and to\r\nhave proceeded dancing and jumping along the road to Armstadt; when\r\nthey arrived at that place they fell exhausted to the ground, and,\r\naccording to the account of an old chronicle, many of them died, after\r\nthey were taken home by their parents, and the rest remained afflicted\r\nto the end of their lives with a permanent tremor. The years 1238 and\r\n1239 were also destructive years in Europe.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1240, the fish died on the coast of England; inclement\r\nseasons prevailed, and pestilence appeared in various parts of that\r\ncountry. Two years after, A.D. 1242, excessive rains swelled\r\nthe river Thames, and inundated the country round about Lambeth on the\r\nSurrey side. The year following was remarkable for the appearance of\r\nmeteors and drought; deadly pestilence prevailed in various parts of\r\nEngland. A.D. 1247, pestilence again occurred in England; it\r\nbroke out in the month of September. A.D. 1249, an earthquake\r\nthrew down St. Michael’s on the Hill without Glastonbury; a severe\r\nshock was felt also about the same period in Somersetshire.\r\n\r\nIn the same year, 1249, a dreadful pestilence ravaged the armies of\r\nSt. Louis the Crusader, caused, says Joinville, his historian, by the\r\ndecomposition of the dead bodies of those who had been slain in two\r\ngreat battles fought a few days previously. They had been thrown into\r\nthe river by the Saracens, and when they floated, were arrested by\r\nthe low bridge, which was the means of communication between the two\r\ndivisions of the French troops. The river was covered with them from\r\nbank to bank, so that the water could not be seen a good stone’s-throw\r\nfrom the bridge upwards. The pious king caused the bodies of the\r\nChristians to be removed from the river and buried in deep graves;\r\nthose of the Saracens were thrust under the arch of the bridge, and\r\nfloated down to the sea. This occurred during Lent, and all that time,\r\nbeing obliged by their creed to live on fish, the soldiers could get no\r\nother than eelpouts,--a gluttonous fish, which fed on the dead bodies.\r\nThe disease which broke out among them, Joinville says, dried up the\r\nflesh on their legs to the bone, and the skin became tanned as black\r\nas the ground, or like an old boot that has long lain behind a coffer\r\n(evidently a kind of dry gangrene). In addition to this miserable\r\ndisorder, those affected by it had another sore complaint in the mouth,\r\nfrom eating such fish, that rotted the gums, and caused a most stinking\r\nbreath: very few escaped death that were thus attacked; and the surest\r\nsymptom of its being fatal was a bleeding at the nose; when that took\r\nplace, none recovered. Starvation was soon added to their miseries, for\r\nthe enemy was enabled so to blockade them, that the provision-boats\r\ncould not reach them. The disorder so increased in the army, that the\r\nbarbers were forced to cut away very large pieces of flesh from the\r\ngums to enable their patients to eat. The mortality was very great\r\nindeed, but what number thus perished miserably is not mentioned by\r\nJoinville.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1250 the summer was rainy and tempestuous, and a hard\r\nwinter followed. The old town of Winchelsea was swallowed up by the\r\nsea, and an earthquake was felt at St. Albans, that did much damage.\r\nThe summer of 1251 was intolerably hot; there was a famine in Italy,\r\nand epidemic pestilence traversed all England, and was attended with\r\ngreat mortality; a thunder-storm occurred, during which the chimney of\r\nthe chamber where the queen and her children lay at Windsor was struck\r\ndown, and the whole apartment violently shaken; large oaks in the park\r\nwere torn up by the roots: the lightning was so terrible as to surpass\r\nany that had occurred in the memory of man. A.D. 1252, the\r\nlate frost in spring, succeeding drought, destroyed the vegetation;\r\nthere were heavy rains in July; at Michaelmas the plague began to rage\r\nin London, and pervaded all England, continuing until August in the\r\nfollowing year, thus affording an instance of this disease beginning in\r\nautumn, running through the winter, and terminating in the summer. The\r\nwinter of 1254 was severely cold; a murrain appeared among sheep, and\r\na mortal disease among horses called ‘the evil of the tongue.’\r\n\r\nA.D. 1255–56 and 1258, the tides rose uncommonly high; a comet\r\nwas observed in 1256; the rivers swelled with excessive rains, tempests\r\nlevelled buildings, the summers were wet, the crops failed by the\r\ndestroying power of the elements, and dearth, famine, and pestilence\r\ncaused great havoc amongst the inhabitants of England; 15,000 persons\r\nperished in London alone from hunger. “The inundations in autumn,”\r\nsays M’Culloch, “destroyed the crops; fatal fevers prevailed,\r\nprincipal in the summer, during the dog-days, when to one cemetery\r\nalone, that of St. Edward’s, 2000 bodies were carried.” Long droughts\r\nsucceeded, and the mortality continued until 1257. _A.D._ 1264,\r\na murrain destroyed much cattle in England, especially horses; and in\r\nA.D. 1266, swarms of the palmer-worms destroyed all vegetation\r\nin Scotland. In 1269, excessive seasons existed; pestilence destroyed\r\nthe Crusaders on their march to the Holy Land, and the French king and\r\nhis son perished by it. A.D. 1274, a grievous rot broke out\r\namongst the sheep, which persisted for twenty-five or twenty-eight\r\nyears, destroying almost all the sheep in England. From the year\r\n1277 to that of 1340 similar seasons, inundations, famines, and\r\npestilence reigned at different times and in different places, among\r\nthe inhabitants of Britain, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Prussia, Zealand,\r\nEgypt, Germany, Bohemia, Spain, &c.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1278. In the month of June, this year, the dancing mania\r\nagain occurred on the Mosel Bridge at Utrecht, when 200 fanatics began\r\nto dance, and would not desist until a priest passed who was carrying\r\nthe host to a person who was sick, upon which, as if in punishment of\r\ntheir crime, the bridge gave way, and they were all drowned.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1283, King Philip of France invaded Spain with an army\r\nconsisting of 200,000 infantry and 8600 cavalry; when at Gerona,\r\nthis army suffered from pestilence, 4000 being carried off by it.\r\nInnumerable swarms of flies, said to be as big as acorns, were\r\ngenerated, and attacked both men and horses, numbers of whom were\r\nkilled by their poison. This pestilential season was attributed to a\r\nmiracle wrought by St. Narcissus.\r\n\r\nAccording to the veterinary surgeons Martin Arrendondo and Fernando\r\nCalvo, in the introduction to the Commentaries of the celebrated\r\nFrancisco de la Reyna, mention is made of an epizootic of great\r\nseverity, which occurred in one of the cities of the kingdom of\r\nSeville, A.D. 1301, by which there died more than 1000 horses. The\r\nabove-mentioned authors derive their information from a paragraph of\r\nLaurenciscus Rasius, in his work entitled ‘Hippiatria or Marescalia,’\r\nin which, when speaking of the diseases of horses, he thus writes:\r\n“Dicta autem infirmitas (febris) epidemialis est, et ex ipsa anno CCCI.\r\nfuerunt in urbe mortui plusquam mille.”\r\n\r\nA.D. 1285, a severe thunder-storm was experienced in various\r\nparts of England: as the king and queen were holding converse in their\r\nbed-room, a flash of lightning passed by them, doing them no injury;\r\nbut it struck and killed two of their attendants who were in an\r\nante-room. It was about this period that water was conveyed to London\r\nby means of leaden pipes after fifty years’ labour. Severe dysentery\r\nprevailed in various parts of the kingdom, as also an epidemic,\r\nsimulating the influenza of the present day, complicated with typhoid\r\nsymptoms, which persisted for upwards of ten years. A.D. 1299,\r\na comet was seen. The seasons for three years were inhospitable; severe\r\ncatarrhs with fluxes pervaded England.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1302, great drought prevailed in Spain similar to those\r\nwhich had occurred for centuries past; famine ensued, when pestilence\r\nraged with great violence, carrying off thousands in various parts of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1307–8, 1309, and 1310, intemperate seasons were\r\nexperienced, and famine was the consequence, more especially in\r\nEngland, Ireland, and Scotland, with great mortality in the latter\r\ncountry. It was about this period that coals were first brought into\r\nuse in England. Various parts of London, as shown by Stow, were in a\r\nfilthy condition, which, with the mode of living, and the disgusting\r\nhabits of the inhabitants, gave ample cause for the outbreak of\r\npestilence. Fleet ditch was “of such breadth and depth,” so says Stow,\r\n“that ten or twelve ships’ navies at once, with merchandise, were\r\nwont to come to the bridge Fleete; for some time this canal had been\r\nneglected, and became an intolerable nuisance in a variety of ways.” It\r\nwas not until 1733 that it was arched over, when the Fleet Market was\r\nbuilt on it. Pope denounces the filthy condition of Fleet ditch in the\r\nfollowing lines of his ‘Dunciad:’\r\n\r\n                                “By Bridewell all descend\r\n    (As morning prayer and flagellation end)\r\n    To where Fleet ditch, with disembouging streams,\r\n    Rolls the large tribute of dead dogs to Thames,\r\n    The _king_ of dykes! than whom no sluice of mud\r\n    With deeper sable blots the silver flood:\r\n    ‘Here trip, my children! here at once leap in,\r\n    Here prove who best can dash through thick and thin;\r\n    And who the most in love of dirt excel--\r\n    Or dark dexterity of groping well;\r\n    Who flings most filth, and wide pollutes around\r\n    The stream, be his the weekly journals’ bound;\r\n    A pig of lead to him who dives the best;\r\n    A peck of coals a-piece shall glad the rest.’”\r\n\r\nA.D. 1316, a peculiar disease prevailed in England,--fever,\r\nwith severe dysentery, which raged with an intensity and mortality\r\nequal to the true plague: scarcity amounting to famine was experienced\r\nat the same time, wheat selling at 45_s._ per quarter, equal in\r\nthose days to £30 sterling of our money. A.D. 1327, a comet\r\nwas seen; the year following, an earthquake, the greatest ever felt in\r\nEngland, occurred on the 14th of November.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1330, the weather was so tempestuous in England, and the\r\nrains fell so heavily, that the harvest did not begin until Michaelmas.\r\nA storm from the westward overthrew several houses and did much damage,\r\ntearing up forest trees of immense size by the roots. Five years after,\r\n1335, there was a grievous famine in England, which was succeeded by\r\npestilence, and attended with great mortality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n                        FROM A.D. 1333 TO 1418.\r\n\r\n\r\nProceeding in the annals of antecedent ages, we have now to record a\r\nseries of mighty revolutions in the organism of the earth, accompanied\r\nby general and awful commotions of the elements.\r\n\r\n             “Earthquakes, Nature’s agonizing pangs,\r\n    Oft shake th’ astonish’d isles;--the Solfaterre\r\n    Or sends forth thick, blue, suffocating streams,\r\n    Or shoots to temporary flame. A din\r\n    Wild through the mountains’ quivering rocky caves,\r\n    Like the dread crash of tumbling planets, roars.\r\n    When tremble thus the pillars of the globe,\r\n    Like the tall cocoa by the fierce north blown,\r\n    Can the poor brittle tenements of man\r\n    Withstand the dread convulsion? Their dear homes\r\n    (Which, shaking, tottering, crashing, bursting, fall)\r\n    The boldest fly; and on the open plain\r\n    Appall’d, in agony the moment wait\r\n    When, with disrupture vast, the waving earth\r\n    Shall ‘whelm them in her sea-disgorging womb.\r\n    Nor less affrighted are the bestial kind:\r\n    The bold steed quivers in each panting vein,\r\n    And staggers bathed in deluges of sweat;\r\n    The lowing herds forsake their grassy food,\r\n    And send forth frighted, woeful, hollow sounds;\r\n    The dog, thy trusty sentinel of night,\r\n    Deserts his post assign’d, and piteous howls.\r\n                          Wide ocean feels\r\n    The mountain waves, passing their custom’d bounds,\r\n    Make direful, loud incursions on the land,\r\n    All-overwhelming: sudden they retreat,\r\n    With their whole troubled waters; but anon\r\n    Sudden return, with louder, mightier force.\r\n    The black rocks whiten, the vex’d shores resound;\r\n    And yet more rapid, distant they retire.\r\n    Vast coruscations lighten all the sky\r\n    With volumed flames; while thunder’s voice\r\n    From forth his shrine, by night and horror girt,\r\n    Astounds the guilty, and appals the good.”\r\n\r\nThe great events to which we allude began, in the year 1333, first\r\nin China. Here parching drought, succeeded by famine, laid waste the\r\ntract of country watered by the rivers Kiang and Hoai. Rain, about this\r\nperiod, fell in torrents in and about Kingsai, destroying, it is said,\r\nby the floods more than 400,000 persons. The mountain Tsincheou, in\r\nfalling, formed vast chasms in the earth. About this time, according\r\nto the diary of Ramon Vila, there were experienced dire famine and\r\npestilence at Barcelona, which in a very short time carried off 10,000\r\npersons.\r\n\r\nIn the succeeding year, 1334, inundations occurred in the neighbourhood\r\nof Canton. Soon after, at Tche, after an unexampled drought, pestilence\r\narose and carried off 500,000 human beings. Hecker graphically\r\ndescribes the unprecedented and universal commotions of this period.\r\nAn earthquake happened near Kingsai, and subsequent to the falling-in\r\nof the mountains of Ki-ming-Chan, a lake was formed, of more than a\r\nhundred leagues in circumference, where thousands found their grave.\r\nIn Houkouang and Ho-nan a drought prevailed for five months, and\r\ninnumerable swarms of locusts destroyed the vegetation; famine and\r\npestilence, as is usually the case, following in their train. It is\r\nremarkable, that, simultaneously with a drought and renewed floods\r\nin China, in 1336, many uncommon atmospheric phenomena and, in the\r\nwinter-time, frequent thunderstorms were observed in the north of\r\nFrance; and, so early as the eventful year 1333, an eruption of Etna\r\ntook place. According to the Chinese annals, 4,000,000 persons perished\r\nby famine in the neighbourhood of Kiang in 1337; and deluges of rain,\r\nswarms of locusts, and an earthquake which lasted six days, caused an\r\nincredible devastation.\r\n\r\nDuring this year, 776 of the Ejira, or 1334 of the Christian era,\r\nMohamed Ben Abdalla Ben Alkhatrib, a native of the city of Granada,\r\nbeing a physician and a member of an illustrious family versed in\r\nall species of cosmography, acquired considerable authority and\r\nimportance amongst many of the Moorish kings of Granada; but, towards\r\nthe termination of his valuable life, fortune became adverse; for\r\nhaving been accused of treason during the reign of Ebn Alahmoz, he was\r\nthrown into prison, and shortly afterwards died, leaving, amongst other\r\nworks on medicine and the veterinary art, one on the mode of avoiding\r\nplague, which is cited by Casiri in his ‘Biblioteca Arábigo Hispana\r\nEscurialense,’ tom. ii. pp. 71 and 72.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1338, Kingsai was visited by an earthquake of ten\r\ndays’ duration; at the same time France suffered from failure in the\r\nharvest. From this period until 1342 there was in China a succession of\r\ninundations, earthquakes, and famines. It seemed as though everywhere\r\non the tops of mountains springs were made to burst forth, and dry\r\ntracts were deluged in an inexplicable manner. Great floods also\r\noccurred in the vicinity of the Rhine, in France, &c. In the year\r\nfollowing, 1343, the mountain Hong-tchang, in China, fell in; and in\r\nPien-tcheou and Leang-tcheou, three months after, rain followed, and\r\nunheard-of inundations, which destroyed seven cities:\r\n\r\n                        “Towers, temples, palaces\r\n    Flung from their deep foundations; roof on roof\r\n    Crush’d horrible, and pile on pile o’erturn’d,\r\n    Fall total!”\r\n\r\nIn Egypt and in Syria violent earthquakes took place, and in China they\r\nbecame from this time more and more frequent; for they recurred, in\r\n1344, in Ven-tcheou, where the sea overflowed. A dreadful earthquake\r\nwas experienced at Lisbon, where vast numbers of the inhabitants\r\nperished by the falling of the buildings. A.D. 1345, in\r\nKi-tcheou, and also in both the following years in Canton, great\r\ncommotions were experienced, especially subterraneous thunder.\r\nMeanwhile floods and famine devastated various districts until 1347,\r\nwhen the fury of the elements subsided in China.\r\n\r\nWhilst pestilence was thus raging, China, Syria, Greece, Egypt,\r\nAsia, and Africa suffered from it, A.D. 1346; and the year\r\nfollowing, 1347, a pestilence similar to that which subsequently\r\ncommitted such ravages in the south of Gaul, Spain, and England (1348),\r\nraged in Italy and Sicily.\r\n\r\n1345. Guido de Gaullaco informs us that in Spain, in the month of\r\nMarch, there broke out a pestilence, which he affirms spread all over\r\nthe world, leaving scarcely a fourth part of the human race alive.\r\nAndres Laguna, Martinez de Leyva, Duarte Nunhez, and other medical\r\nwriters, speak with horror and astonishment of this terrific plague,\r\nwhich, they say, lasted five years.\r\n\r\nAbu Giaphar Ahmed Ebn Ali Ebn Khatemar, a native of the city of\r\nAlmeria, and one of the Arabian physicians, who, according to Casiri,\r\nwas instructed in the history of the great pestilences, which nearly\r\nthe entire world suffered from in the years of the Egira 748, 749,\r\nand 750, or of the Christian epoch 1347–48 and 1349, quotes the\r\nfollowing passage: “The pestilence first broke out in Africa, whence\r\nit extended through all parts of Egypt and Asia, and finally attacked\r\nItaly, France, and Spain; but in the city of Almeria, where it raged\r\nwith great malignity, it lasted nearly eleven months, namely, from\r\nthe beginning of the month Rabiu, the first month of the year of the\r\nEgira 749, and of the Christian epoch 1348, until the commencement of\r\nthe following year.” The work which contains the description of this\r\npestilence consists of ten chapters, and is entitled ‘Morbi in posterum\r\nvitandi Descriptio et Remedia.’ Don Miguel Casiri makes mention of it\r\nin his Codex of the year 1780.\r\n\r\nAbu Abdalla Mohamed Ben Alkhatrib, a native of Granada and brother\r\nof the other Alkhatrib, also wrote a work on the causes and cure of\r\nthe pestilence that affected the city of Granada in the year of the\r\nEgira 749, and of our Lord 1348, entitled ‘Quæsita de morbo horribili\r\nperutilia;’ and Casiri alludes to this work also in his Codex.\r\n\r\nVillanius, the historian of Florence, gives an account of a pestilence\r\nwhich commenced in A.D. 1346 in Upper Asia: it first appeared\r\nin Cathay; it arose from a most filthy smelling vapour, supposed to\r\nhave proceeded from a certain fiery body, which either fell down from\r\nthe atmosphere, or was eructated from the earth. This vapour, like a\r\nfire, consumed all that stood in its way,--animals, horses, trees, &c.,\r\nfor the space of fifteen days’ journey all around; and some most filthy\r\nlittle beasts furnished with feet and tails, as also worms and a small\r\nkind of snake in numberless multitudes, fell at the same time from\r\nthe atmosphere upon the earth; the stench and putrefaction from these\r\ninfected the very air and all the circumjacent regions. A pestilence\r\nhaving arisen from them, spread around, depopulating the whole of\r\nAsia, and subsequently Egypt, Greece, and Italy; thence it spread into\r\nFrance, Spain, and England, and at length into Germany. In the city\r\nof Florence alone, says Villanius, there perished 60,000 persons, but\r\nSt. Anthony computes the number to have been 100,000. There prevailed\r\nabout this period, or at the commencement of the year 1347, epidemic\r\npestilence, in the shape of pleurisies, quinsies, and spotted fevers,\r\nwhich at last terminated in the real Oriental plague, with buboes and\r\ncarbuncles: it was reported that 50,000 were carried off in London\r\nin one week, and the deaths at Norwich were almost equally numerous.\r\nAbout this period, 100,000 persons perished from pestilence at Venice:\r\nLubeck lost 90,000, while the deaths from similar disease were computed\r\nat 200,000 in the kingdom of Spain. This pestilence persisted in many\r\nparts during the following year.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of 1348 pestilence universally prevailed over Europe\r\nand in other quarters of the globe; it commenced in Syria, spread along\r\nthe shores of the Pontic Sea, and of Greece and Illyria, passed into\r\nItaly and Sicily, and thence to the island of Mallorca: according to\r\nZurita, it almost depopulated that island in less than a month, more\r\nthan 5000 persons having been carried off by it. In the same year,\r\ncontinues Zurita, a general pestilence extended from the East to the\r\nultimate boundaries of the West, comprising in its ravages the kingdom\r\nof Valencia and the principalities of Catalonia. In the month of June\r\nit broke out in the city of Valencia, and its virulence was such,\r\nespecially in the maritime parts, that, as before noticed, scarcely\r\nany part of Europe escaped,--persons died suddenly; from Italy it\r\npassed into Sicily, Sardinia, and so on to Mallorca. So great was the\r\nmortality at Barcelona, that in the month of June, during the usual\r\nannual solemn procession, which caused a number of priests, &c., from\r\nScio to be present, thousands died, and amongst them four magistrates\r\nand almost all the Council of Ciento. During this period, says another\r\nauthor, the signs of terrestrial commotions were exhibited in Europe.\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Edward III. it rained in England from Midsummer\r\nunto Christmas, when a pestilential period commenced. A disease termed\r\n‘Sorte Diod,’--the black pestilence, or death,--committed the most\r\nterrific ravages; the lungs were principally affected. Fracastorius, in\r\nhis ‘Syphilis,’ describes the malady. The translation runs thus:\r\n\r\n    “A hundred years twice told have took their flight\r\n    Since Saturn mix’d with Mars his hated light,\r\n    Who, with their baleful influence, did infest\r\n    The rich and potent nations of the East:\r\n    Hence raged a dreadful pest before unknown,\r\n    Which seized the lungs, and made the breast its throne;\r\n    Four days it tyrannized with dreadful sway,\r\n    When life in purple streams broke out and fled away.”\r\n\r\nThis malady was accompanied by fever, difficulty of breathing, and\r\nspitting of blood; the respiration was so laborious that the sick were\r\nobliged to be always in an upright posture; deglutition was difficult,\r\nattended with flushed countenance and great restlessness: at the\r\nonset the cough was violent, but without loss of blood; after a short\r\ntime, the expectoration becoming bloody, hemorrhage succeeded, when\r\ndeath ensued in three days: spots and abscesses sometimes formed when\r\nthe disease was protracted unto the fifth day. After the disease had\r\npersisted for some months, the lungs were no longer affected, but the\r\nglands of the axillæ and of the groins, and the parotids, swelled and\r\nsuppurated. In England it lasted nine years. There were 50,000 buried\r\nin one year in the Charterhouse churchyard in London. A murrain among\r\nthe cattle succeeded this pestilence, and there was a great scarcity\r\nof all sorts of provisions. Greenland was entirely depopulated by this\r\npestilence.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1348, the island of Cyprus was also visited by a most\r\nterrific pestilence; a tremendous earthquake shook the foundations of\r\nthe island, and was accompanied by so frightful a hurricane, that the\r\ninhabitants who had slain the Mahometan slaves, in order that they\r\nmight not themselves be subjugated by them, fled in dismay in all\r\ndirections. The sea overflowed,--the ships were dashed to pieces on the\r\nrocks, and few outlived the dreadful event, whereby this fertile and\r\nblooming island was converted into a desert. Before the earthquake,\r\nit is recorded by Deguignes (p. 225) that a pestiferous wind spread\r\nso poisonous an odour, that many, being overpowered by it, fell down\r\nsuddenly and expired in dreadful agonies. This phenomenon resembles\r\nmany such noticed by ancient authors. This peculiar condition of the\r\natmosphere was evident to the senses; borne by the winds, it spread\r\nfrom land to land, carrying disease over whole portions of the earth.\r\nIt has been further recorded that, during this period, 1348, an\r\nunexampled earthquake, on the 25th of January, shook Greece, Italy,\r\nand the neighbouring countries. Naples, Rome, Pisa, Bologna, Padua,\r\nVenice, and many other cities suffered considerably; whole villages\r\nwere swallowed up; castles, houses, and churches were overthrown, and\r\nthousands of people were buried under their ruins. In Carinthia, thirty\r\nvillages, together with all the churches, were demolished; more than a\r\nthousand corpses were drawn from under the rubbish: the city of Villach\r\nwas completely destroyed, and very few of its inhabitants were saved;\r\nwhen the earth ceased to tremble, it was found that mountains had been\r\nmoved from their position, and that many hamlets were left in ruins.\r\nIt is recorded that during this earthquake the wine in casks became\r\nturbid,--a statement which may be considered as furnishing a proof that\r\nchanges causing a decomposition of the atmosphere had taken place;\r\nsimilar destructive earthquakes extended as far as the neighbourhood of\r\nBasle, and recurred from time to time until 1360 throughout Germany,\r\nFrance, Silesia, Poland, England, and Denmark also, much further north.\r\nIn the month of August, 1349, says Walsingham, black death broke out\r\nat Southampton, destroying half the population. According to another\r\nestimate, (Rymer, Fœdera,) A.D. 1348–49, and 1350, one-tenth\r\npart of the people did not survive. In a royal edict, issued December,\r\n1349, it is said, “Non modica pars populi est defuncta;” in another,\r\n1350, “Magna pars populi est defuncta.” This pestilence spread over\r\nFrance and Germany, and invaded the northern parts of Europe in the\r\nyear 1349.\r\n\r\nIn the years of our Lord 1350 and 1351 sore disease prevailed in\r\nIreland, Holland, and in England; its infallible signs were, a great\r\nfever, vomiting, and spitting of blood, hemorrhage from the nose,\r\nmouth, ears, eyes, stomach, and bowels, indicating an universal\r\ndisorganization of the system. Here we have the worst symptoms\r\nobservable in the bilious remittent or yellow fever of the West Indies\r\nand other parts. It traversed all Germany, Russia, Hungary, Spain,\r\nand Gaul. In Denmark it spread terror and dismay, and it decimated\r\nIceland; it persisted during the summer, autumn, winter, and spring of\r\nthose years; and for several years after, violent peripneumoniæ raged\r\nin Asia, Egypt, and various other parts of the globe.--A.D.\r\n1352. During this year scarcely one-fourth part of the Oxford students\r\nsurvived the plague. (A. Wood, Ath. Oxon., A.D. 1349–52.) It\r\nfell with redoubled violence on workmen and servants. The same year\r\ngreat numbers were carried off by pestilence in Montpelier. A great\r\nmany of the lower orders of society died of the plague in England.\r\nThis disease caused great ravages in Denmark, and also in Iceland; the\r\nGreenland merchants were all destroyed by it: it seized the monks and\r\nregular clergy of all descriptions; 133 out of 140 members died of one\r\nsociety in Montpelier. A similar mortality happened in the Magdalen\r\nSociety; not one out of 140 in Marseilles survived; 66 Carmelites\r\nperished in Avignon. This plague began in a monastery of crowded, idle,\r\nvoluptuous monks. Cattle suffered greatly in many countries; 6000 sheep\r\ndied in one pasture in England. Pestilence and famine, it is supposed,\r\ncarried off in China, about this period, at least 900,000 of its\r\ninhabitants: in London, 50,000 bodies were interred in one graveyard.\r\nThe following estimate of deaths during the above awful period was\r\nconsidered below the actual number of victims: in Venice 100,000 died;\r\nBasle, 14,000; Erfurt, 16,000; Strasburgh, about the same number;\r\nParis, 50,000; Norwich, in England, 50,000; Marseilles, in one month,\r\n56,000! Florence, 60,000; Avignon, 62,000; London, 100,000; in Lubeck,\r\n90,000; in Spain, two-thirds of the population were destroyed; and\r\nIreland was nearly depopulated.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1355, a peculiar kind of madness was epidemic in England;\r\nthose affected fled into the woods, and wandered about the fields.\r\n(Hecker.) Three years after, epidemic pestilence ravaged England,\r\nAfrica, Cyprus, and also Italy and Florence, which last city, says\r\nPetrarch, lost 100,000 citizens. The same kind of pestilence also\r\nafflicted Gaul, Ireland, and Scotland. Stow, in his Chronicle, gives\r\na very graphic description of the foregoing pestilential period from\r\n1348 up to 1357. The pestilence he describes as a new disease. He\r\nsays: “There began amongst the East Indians and Tartarians a certain\r\npestilence, which at length waxed so general, infecting the middle\r\nregions of the air so greatly, that it destroyed the Saracens, Turks,\r\nSyrians, Palestinians, and the Grecians with a wonderful or rather\r\nincredible death; insomuch that those people being exceedingly dismayed\r\nwith the terror thereof, consulted among themselves, and thought it\r\ngood to receive the Christian faith and sacraments; for they had\r\nintelligence that the Christians which dwelt on this side of the Greek\r\nSea were not so greatly troubled with sickness and mortality more than\r\ncommon.” “At length this terrible slaughter passed over into those\r\ncountries which are on this side the Alps, and thence to the parts\r\nof France which are called Hesperia, and so on, by order, along into\r\nGermany and Dutchland; and the seventh year after it began, it came\r\ninto England, and first began in the towns and ports joining on the\r\nsea-coasts, Dorsetshire, where, even as in other countries, it made\r\nthe country quite void of inhabitants, so that there were almost none\r\nleft alive. Thence it passed into Devonshire and Somersetshire, and\r\neven into Bristol, and raged in such sort that the Gloucestershire men\r\nwould not suffer persons from Bristol to have any access unto them or\r\ninto their country by any means; but at length it came to Gloucester,\r\nyea, and to Oxford and London, and finally it spread over all England,\r\nand so wasted and spoiled the people, that scarce the tenth person of\r\nall sorts was left alive; churchyards were not sufficient and large\r\nenough to bury their dead in: they chose certain fields appointed for\r\nthe purpose, amongst which was the piece of ground denominated the\r\nChurchyard of the Holy Trinity, near East Smithfield, opened by one\r\nJohn Cory. One Walter Manny also purchased a piece of ground called\r\nSpital Croft, containing thirteen acres, in which were interred during\r\nthe next year 50,000 bodies; in Norwich, no less than 37,104 persons,\r\nbesides Mendicants and Dominicans, and in Yarmouth 7502; so that the\r\nliving which was previously worth 700 marks was reduced to £40 per\r\nyear.” “What time this pestilence had wasted all England, the Scots,\r\ngreatly rejoicing, mocked and swore ofttimes, ‘By the vile death of the\r\nEnglishmen;’ but the sword of God’s wrath slew and consumed the Scots\r\nin no less numbers than it did the other. It also wasted the Welshmen,\r\nand within a while passed over into Ireland, where it destroyed a great\r\nnumber of English people that dwelt there; but such as were right\r\nIrish-born, that dwelt in the hilly country, it scarcely touched, so\r\nthat few of them died thereof.”\r\n\r\nA.D. 1360. Thunder-storms, accompanied by heavy rains and\r\nlightning, did much damage in various parts of England; houses were set\r\non fire, crops and cattle were destroyed, and pestilence, in the shape\r\nof fevers and disorder of the bowels, carried off numbers.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of January, two years after, A.D. 1362, a feast\r\nwas instituted, and a solemn mass celebrated in Scio, with divine\r\nworship in all the churches, convents, and other public places, at\r\nwhich all the clergy of the place assisted; and on the 15th of February\r\na papal jubilee was published for the repose of the souls of all those\r\nwho had perished by the pestilence, which had recently carried off vast\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1363, a dreadfully severe winter presaged noxious seasons\r\nin Europe. Andalusia was afflicted with a terrible pestilence, which\r\nhaving seized an almost incredible number of its inhabitants, is\r\nmarked among the ancient writings as the second mortality, in order to\r\ndistinguish it from the first of 1350, during which King Don Alonso\r\ndied in the neighbourhood of Gibraltar. This pestilence made such\r\nan impression on the minds of all Spaniards, that in a sepulchral\r\ninscription in the church of St. Pablo, we read that it was erected\r\nduring the second mortality, A.D. 1363. Two years after,\r\nA.D. 1365, pestilence carried off 20,000 of the inhabitants of\r\nCologne and its vicinity.\r\n\r\nFrom the year 1368 unto 1370, epidemic pestilence ravaged England and\r\nIreland; four years after, it continued to lay England waste. A similar\r\npestilence, about the same time, prevailed with great mortality in\r\nItaly and in Gaul.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1371, pestilence was rife at Barcelona; and on the\r\n13th of June, imprecatory processions were instituted in each of the\r\nparishes of that place on account of the pestilence, which lasted for\r\none year. A comet was seen this year.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1372, pestilence invaded Germany, Egypt, Greece, and all\r\nthe East. Lubeck lost 90,000 of its inhabitants.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1373, the use of coals was forbidden by Act of\r\nParliament, under the idea that the smoke in London corrupted the air.\r\n\r\nIn the year of our Lord 1374, the epidemic dancing disease of St.\r\nGuy and St. John prevailed in Holland and in the Rhenish provinces,\r\nand an analogous malady, called ‘Tarantisme’ and ‘Tigretier,’ among\r\nthe Abyssinians; a similar disease also prevailed in the Shetland\r\nIslands, where it had existed from time to time, as it is said,\r\nfor one hundred years previously. The disease also prevailed in\r\nFrance, and the sufferers were called ‘Convulsionnaires;’ it was\r\nevidently the malady which we now term St. Vitus’ Dance or Chorea,\r\nbut prevailing epidemically. Hecker gives the following account of\r\nthis strange malady, as it occurred about this period also in Germany;\r\nit was evidently a disease similar to that which broke out, A.D.\r\n1027, in Bernburg, prevailed A.D. 1237 at Erfurt among children, and\r\nsubsequently among adults, A.D. 1278, at Utrecht. He says “that the\r\neffects of the ‘Black Death’ had not yet subsided, and the graves of\r\nmillions of its victims were scarcely closed when a strange delusion\r\narose in Germany, which took possession of the minds of men, and,\r\nin spite of the divinity of our nature, hurried away body and soul\r\ninto the magic circle of hellish superstition. It was a convulsion\r\nwhich, in the most extraordinary manner, infuriated the human frame,\r\nand excited the astonishment of contemporaries for more than two\r\ncenturies, since which time it has never re-appeared. It was called\r\nthe Dance of St. John or of St. Vitus, on account of the Bacchantic\r\nleaps by which it was characterized, and which gave to those affected,\r\nwhilst performing their wild dance, and screaming and foaming with\r\nfury, all the appearance of persons possessed. It did not remain\r\nconfined to particular localities, but was propagated by the sight of\r\nthe sufferers, like a demoniacal epidemic, over the whole of Germany\r\nand the neighbouring countries to the north-west, which were already\r\nprepared for its reception by the prevailing opinion of the times.\r\n\r\n“So early as the year 1374, assemblages of men and women were seen\r\nat Aix-la-Chapelle, who had come out of Germany, and who, united by\r\none common delusion, exhibited to the public, both in the streets\r\nand in the churches, the following strange spectacle. They formed\r\ncircles hand-in-hand, and, appearing to have lost all control over\r\ntheir senses, continued dancing, regardless of the by-standers, for\r\nhours together, in wild delirium, until at length they fell down to\r\nthe ground in a state of exhaustion. They then complained of extreme\r\noppression, and groaned as if in the agonies of death, until they\r\nwere swathed in cloths bound tightly round their waists, upon which\r\nthey again recovered, and remained free from complaint until the next\r\nattack. This practice of swathing was resorted to on account of the\r\ntympany which followed these spasmodic ravings, but the by-standers\r\nfrequently relieved patients in a less artificial manner by thumping\r\nand trampling upon the parts affected. While dancing, they neither saw\r\nnor heard, being insensible to external impressions through the senses,\r\nbut were haunted by visions, their fancies conjuring up spirits, whose\r\nnames they shrieked out; and some of them afterwards asserted that they\r\nfelt as if they had been immersed in a stream of blood, which obliged\r\nthem to leap so high. Others during the paroxysm saw the heavens open\r\nand the Saviour enthroned with the Virgin Mary, according as the\r\nreligious notions of the age were strangely and variously reflected in\r\ntheir imaginations.\r\n\r\n“Where the disease was completely developed, the attack commenced with\r\nepileptic convulsions. Those affected fell to the ground senseless,\r\npanting and labouring for breath; they foamed at the mouth, and\r\nsuddenly springing up, began their dance amidst strange contortions.\r\nYet the malady doubtless made its appearance very variously, and was\r\nmodified by temporary or local circumstances, whereof non-medical\r\ncontemporaries but imperfectly noted the essential particulars,\r\naccustomed as they were to confound their observations of natural\r\nevents with their notions of the world of spirits.\r\n\r\n“It was but a few months ere this demoniacal disease had spread from\r\nAix-la-Chapelle, where it appeared in July, over the neighbouring\r\nNetherlands. In Liege, Utrecht, Tongres, and many other towns of\r\nBelgium, the dancers appeared with garlands in their hair, and their\r\nwaists girt with cloths, that they might, as soon as the paroxysm\r\nwas over, receive immediate relief on the attack of the tympany.\r\nThis bandage was, by the insertion of a stick, easily twisted tight;\r\nmany, however, obtained more relief from kicks and blows, which they\r\nfound numbers of persons ready to administer; for where the dancers\r\nappeared, the people assembled in crowds to gratify their curiosity\r\nwith the frightful spectacle. At length the increasing number of the\r\naffected excited no less anxiety than the attention that was paid to\r\nthem. In towns and villages they took possession of the religious\r\nhouses; processions were everywhere instituted on their account, and\r\nmasses were said, and hymns were sung, while the disease itself, of the\r\ndemoniacal origin of which no one entertained the least doubt, excited\r\neverywhere astonishment and horror. In Liege the priests had recourse\r\nto exorcisms, and endeavoured by every means in their power to allay an\r\nevil which threatened so much danger to themselves; for the possessed,\r\nassembling in multitudes, frequently poured forth imprecations against\r\nthem and menaced their destruction. They intimidated the people also\r\nto such a degree that there was an express ordinance issued, that no\r\none should make any but square-toed shoes, because these fanatics had\r\nmanifested a morbid dislike to the pointed shoes which had come into\r\nfashion immediately after the great mortality in 1350. They were still\r\nmore irritated at the sight of red colours, the influence of which\r\non the disordered nerves might lead us to imagine an extraordinary\r\naccordance between this spasmodic malady and the condition of\r\ninfuriated animals; but in the St. John’s dancers this excitement was\r\nprobably connected with apparitions, consequent on their convulsions.\r\nThere were likewise some of them who were unable to endure the sight\r\nof persons weeping.” “A few months after this dancing malady had made\r\nits appearance at Aix-la-Chapelle, it broke out at Cologne, where the\r\nnumber of those possessed amounted to more than five hundred; and about\r\nthe same time at Metz, the streets of which place are said to have been\r\nfilled with eleven hundred dancers. * * * * * Girls and boys quitted\r\ntheir parents, and servants their masters, to amuse themselves at the\r\ndances of those possessed, and greedily imbibed the poison of mental\r\ninfection. Above a hundred unmarried women were seen raving about, in\r\nconsecrated and unconsecrated places, and the consequences were soon\r\nperceived. Gangs of idle vagabonds, who understood how to imitate\r\nto the life the gestures and convulsions of those really affected,\r\nroved from place to place, seeking maintenance and adventures, and\r\nthus wherever they went spread this disgusting spasmodic disease like\r\na plague; for in maladies of this kind the susceptible are infected\r\nas easily by the appearance as by the reality. At last it was found\r\nnecessary to drive away these mischievous guests, who were equally\r\ninaccessible to the exorcisms of the priests and the remedies of the\r\nphysicians. It was not, however, until after four months that the\r\nRhenish cities were able to suppress these impostures, which had so\r\nalarmingly increased the original evil.”\r\n\r\nA.D. 1375, on the 20th of June, an imprecatory procession\r\nwas instituted at Scio, on account of the dreadful pestilence which\r\nbroke out there, and which raged more than twelve months. (_Vide_\r\nCapmany, ‘Historical and Chronological Compendium of Plagues,’ p. 66.)\r\n\r\nA.D. 1379, epidemic pestilence prevailed in England,\r\nespecially in the northern parts of the island. A.D. 1380,\r\nthere was a general inundation in Spain, from which resulted epidemic\r\npestilence, characteristic of an atmosphere surcharged with moisture.\r\nThree years after, 1383, was a period most fatal to Seville, in\r\nconsequence of a pestilence having broken out there, which extended\r\nthrough its entire length and breadth. This terrible infliction was\r\ncalled by the old inhabitants the third mortality: it was preceded by\r\ninundations and extraordinary showers, which act unquestionably as\r\npredisposing causes of disease. A severe earthquake destroyed several\r\nchurches A.D. 1382.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the years 1350 and 1363 were denominated the years of\r\nthe first and second mortality. The precautionary measures that were\r\nadopted to meet such evils were the formation of various hospitals\r\nfor the treatment of the sick, instituted by the bishop, dean, and\r\necclesiastical and secular chapters. The physicians and surgeons not\r\nonly contributed by their science to the relief of the plague-stricken,\r\nbut also with their personal charity and the salaries which were\r\nassigned them by the city authorities. A hospital was founded under the\r\nprotection of St. Cosmo and St. Amien in the parish of St. Salvalo, the\r\npatronage of which was given to the city.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1384. During this year the third plague of Mallorca\r\nbroke out; it caused considerable mortality, according to the account\r\ngiven by Vincente Mut in his history of that kingdom. Numbers of the\r\nsoldiers of the army of Don Juan, the first king of Castile, who were\r\nin garrison at Lisbon, fell sick in consequence of the severity of the\r\natmospheric changes, to which they were unaccustomed. The losses and\r\nsufferings of the Castilian camp increased every day, and hundreds of\r\nthem became ill, and consequently the king was induced to change his\r\nposition and remove his armada to Seville.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of 1386 there was in Gallicia much sickness among\r\nthe soldiers commanded by Tornas Moraix: the character of the epidemic\r\nis but imperfectly given, but history states the mortality to have been\r\nvery great.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1387, the army of the King of Portugal and of the Duke\r\nof Lancaster suffered from severe pestilence in Benavento, and in the\r\ntowns of Matillas, Arzon, Villalobos, Rales, and Valderas, owing to the\r\nscarcity of provisions. In the years 1388 and 1389, violent tempests,\r\npreceded by great drought, happened; a famine ensued, when anginas and\r\ndysenteries prevailed in England and in other parts of the world. The\r\ndisease affected children principally, and continued unto 1400. During\r\nthis period, 1391, the disease was especially mortal in England, being\r\nfelt most severely in Norfolk and at York. The year previously, 1390,\r\nwhen King Edward was on his march and within two leagues of Chartres, a\r\nviolent storm arose, with thunder and lightning, which killed 6000 of\r\nhis horses and upwards of 1000 of his best troops.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1394, a great mortality occurred from epidemic pestilence\r\nin the kingdom of Valencia and in the principality of Catalonia,\r\narising from great heat; nearly 10,000 persons, a greater part of\r\nwhom were young, died in the city of Valencia alone. This pestilence\r\noccurred during the reign of King Don Juan.--A.D. 1396. On the\r\n9th of December of this year, King Don Martin retired to the city of\r\nPerpignan in consequence of Barcelona being visited by pestilence.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1400. The continued heavy rains and sterility having\r\ninduced famine in Seville, caused also great mortality and pestilence,\r\nwhich diminished the population wonderfully. The author of the Annals\r\nof Seville mentions that this plague occurred at centenary periods.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1401. A comet was seen. Pestilence broke out at Florence.\r\n30,000 persons died of epidemic disease this year in London. Five\r\nyears after, London was revisited by deadly pestilence. In Bourdeaux\r\na malignant dysentery destroyed 14,000 persons, and a similar disease\r\nwas equally fatal in Aquitaine and Gascony. A.D. 1407, the\r\nMediterranean was frozen over for fifteen weeks.--A.D. 1411.\r\nTwo diseases, very similar, appeared in France this year, and were\r\nequally general; the first was called ‘Tac,’ the second ‘Ladendo:’\r\nboth were accompanied by severe cough. In the Ladendo there seems to\r\nhave been some affection of the kidney of an inflammatory nature:\r\nthe pain was as severe as in a fit of the stone, and was followed by\r\nfever, loss of appetite, and incessant cough, which terminated very\r\nfrequently in unpleasant eruptions about the nose and mouth; the\r\ndisease ran its course generally in fifteen days, and was unattended\r\nby danger, notwithstanding the severity of the symptoms. Three years\r\nafter, an epidemic disease of a similar nature re-appeared in France,\r\nwhen it received the name of ‘Coqueluche:’ it was attended with severe\r\nhoarseness, and was so general that all public business in Paris was\r\ninterrupted by it.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1410. Epidemic pestilence broke out at Seville this year;\r\nit commenced in Niebla, Gibraleon, and Trigueros, and extended thence\r\nto Seville, where it raged from March unto August. On the 30th of May\r\nand on the 5th of August an earthquake was felt at Barcelona, and\r\nepidemic pestilence prevailed, which lasted until the anniversary of\r\nthe Nativity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n                        FROM A.D. 1418 TO 1530.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1418, Strasburgh was visited by the ‘Dancing Plague,’\r\nand the same infatuation existed amongst the people there, as in the\r\ntowns of Belgium and the Lower Rhine A.D. 1374; many who were\r\nseized on seeing the affected, excited attention at first by their\r\nconfused and absurd behaviour, and then by their constantly following\r\nthe swarms of dancers. These were seen day and night passing through\r\nthe streets, accompanied by musicians playing on bagpipes, and by\r\ninnumerable spectators attracted by curiosity, to whom were added\r\nanxious parents and relations who came to look after those among the\r\nmisguided multitude who belonged to their respective families.\r\n\r\nImposture and profligacy played their part in this city also, but the\r\nmorbid delusion itself seems to have predominated. On this account\r\nreligion could only bring provisional aid, and therefore the Town\r\nCouncil benevolently took an interest in the afflicted: they divided\r\nthem into separate parties, to each of which they appointed responsible\r\nsuperintendents, to protect them from harm, and perhaps also to\r\nrestrain their turbulence. They were thus conducted on foot and in\r\ncarriages to the chapels of St. Vitus, near Zabern, and Rotestein,\r\nwhere priests were in attendance to influence their misguided minds\r\nby masses and other religious ceremonies. After divine worship was\r\ncompleted, they were led in solemn procession to the altar, where they\r\nmade some small offering of alms, and where, it is probable, many,\r\nthrough the influence of devotion and the sanctity of the place, were\r\ncured of this lamentable aberration.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of observation, at all events, that the dancing mania\r\ndid not recommence at the altars of the saint, that from him alone\r\nassistance was implored, and that through his miraculous interposition\r\na cure was expected, which was beyond the reach of human skill. The\r\npersonal history of St. Vitus is by no means unimportant in this\r\nmatter. He was a Sicilian youth, who, together with Modestus and\r\nCrescentia, suffered martyrdom at the time of the persecution of\r\nthe Christians under Diocletian, in A.D. 303. The legends\r\nrespecting him are obscure, and he would certainly have been passed\r\nover without notice among the innumerable apocryphal martyrs of the\r\nearliest centuries, had not the transfer of his body to St. Denys, and\r\nthence in the year 836 to Corvey, raised him to a higher rank. From\r\nthis time forth it may be supposed that many miracles were performed at\r\nhis new sepulchre, which were of essential service in confirming the\r\nRoman Catholic faith among the Germans, and St. Vitus was soon ranked\r\namong the fourteen saintly helpers (Nothelfer or Apotheker). His altars\r\nwere multiplied, and the people had recourse to them in all kinds of\r\ndistresses; they revered him as a powerful intercessor. As the worship\r\nof these saints was, however, at that time stripped of all historical\r\nconnexions, which were purposely obliterated by the priesthood, a\r\nlegend was invented at the beginning of the fifteenth century, or\r\nperhaps even so early as the fourteenth, that St. Vitus had, just\r\nbefore he bent his neck to the sword, prayed to God that he might\r\nprotect from the dancing mania all those who should solemnize the day\r\nof his commemoration and fast upon its eve, and that thereupon a voice\r\nfrom heaven was heard, saying, “Vitus, thy prayer is accepted.” Thus\r\nSt. Vitus became the patron saint of those affected with the dancing\r\nplague, as St. Martin of Tours was at one time the succourer of persons\r\nin small-pox; St. Anthony, of those suffering under the ‘hellish fire;’\r\nand as St. Margaret was the Juno Lucina of pregnant women.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1426, the Baltic was frozen over, and on the 28th of\r\nSeptember a severe earthquake was felt in England. Dantzic was visited\r\nby pestilence and famine; and the year following, England suffered from\r\nepidemic pestilence, and a severe earthquake, which occurred on the\r\n14th of July.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1429, epidemic pestilence prevailed at Barcelona, as\r\nis proved by the donation of £8 and 16 sueldos, which were paid to a\r\nchaplain for his labour in removing for burial the dead bodies found in\r\nthe churches and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1434, there was a severe frost in England, which lasted\r\nfrom the 24th of November to the 10th of February in the following year.\r\n\r\nThis year, 1436, the seasons were inclement and rainy, and there was\r\na dearth of corn in various parts of Europe. Epidemic coughs, small\r\npox, and fevers swept away many thousands from the face of the earth.\r\nThe moisture which existed during the preceding year in Spain, was\r\nexcessive; it did not cease raining and snowing in Castile from the\r\n29th of October, 1434, to the 7th of January in the following year,\r\n1435.\r\n\r\nFour years after, 1439, the city Huesca, in the kingdom of Aragon,\r\nsuffered from such a cruel pestilence, that, following the credulity\r\nof the times, Alonso de Burgos says in his Treatise on Plague, “that\r\nthe disease in Huesca only yielded to a solemn and general vow which\r\nthe city made, to celebrate a feast on the day of the Conception of the\r\nVirgin, and to observe its vigil with an absolute fast.”\r\n\r\nA.D. 1438, there was a famine in England. During a storm on\r\nthe 25th of November a heavy gust of wind blew off the leads of the\r\nGrey Friars Church, in London, and almost beat down the whole side of a\r\nstreet called the Old Exchange.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1441. During this year, brother Diego de Herrera\r\ncomplained of an itching, or leprosy, all over his body: the physicians\r\ndeclared the disease to be communicable, and obliged him to live\r\noutside the monastery of Mejorada--a fact showing that this disease had\r\nexisted previously in Spain, and that the physicians were acquainted\r\nwith its characters. These observations are to be found in the life of\r\nthe illustrious Senhor Don Diego de Anaya, Archbishop of Granada.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1443, there was a severe frost in England from the\r\n14th of November until the 10th of February in the following year.\r\nA thunder-storm with severe lightning did much damage to St. Paul’s\r\nChurch and to that of Waltham Cross; they were fired by the lightning\r\non Candlemas day. From about this period until 1450, famine and\r\npestilence were destructive to millions of the human race, especially\r\nin Italy, Gaul, Germany, Asia, and Spain. About the same date, King Don\r\nAlonso of Aragon, surnamed the Wise, conquered the kingdom of Naples.\r\nThe great obstacles which presented themselves before accomplishing the\r\nsubjugation of the provinces of Abruzzo, coupled with the sufferings\r\ncaused by a protracted and desperate war, subjected the numerous\r\ncavalry employed in the service to attacks of disease. Great numbers\r\nof their horses died from a particular kind of epizootic. This great\r\nmortality caused the king to order his major domo, one Manuel Diaz,\r\nto call together all the veterinary surgeons of his cavalry and the\r\nsurgeons of the infantry, in order that they should compose a work on\r\nfarriery--thus giving rise to the renewal of that most useful art, as\r\nnoted in the Spanish Hippiatria, or Veterinary of Spain.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1446, the sea broke down the dykes at Dort, in Holland,\r\non the 17th of April, and drowned 100,000 persons.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1448. “Owing to the heavy rains of the previous year,\r\n1447,” says Martinez de Leiva, “a severe pestilence prevailed,\r\nwhich was attributed to the excess of moisture, conjoined with the\r\nunprecedented heat:” it was rife in various parts of Spain. On the 11th\r\nof October, public prayers were offered up at Barcelona on account\r\nof this pestilence and of other calamities, such as earthquakes, &c.\r\nDuring this year great mortality occurred in the army of King Alonso\r\nV., encamped in the neighbourhood of Pomblein.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1450, in the month of June, a pestilence broke out\r\nin the city of Saragossa. Zurita, who in his Annals of Aragon gives\r\nan account of this pestilence, specifies but little, although it is\r\nknown to have raged for some time, and to have extended to Barcelona,\r\nwhere it continued for two years after (1452). On the Sabbath, the\r\n22nd of April, the authorities of this city, Barcelona, despatched\r\na state-messenger to the monasteries of Saint Gerónimo de la Murta,\r\nof the district of Ebro, de Monte Alegre, de Poblet, de Santa Cruce,\r\nand de Escala Dei, to solicit the brethren to implore the Almighty to\r\nrelieve them from the sore pestilence with which the city was visited.\r\nOn the 13th of June of this year, the Queen Donna Maria retired, with\r\nher Court, from the city, for fear of the pestilence.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1456. There were two comets observed this year: three\r\nyears after, 1459, the Baltic was so frozen over, that people travelled\r\non the ice from Denmark to Lubeck, Wismar, Rostock, and Stralsund.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1465, pestilence again visited Italy. On the 6th of\r\nDecember of this year, the brothers Miguel Capelier and Leonardo\r\nCrestia, of the order of St. Francis of the Convent of Jesus, were\r\ndeputed by the corporation of the city of Barcelona to implore the\r\ninterposition of the Almighty to free the city from pestilence. The\r\nyear following, Cadiz was nearly depopulated by a plague. Other parts\r\nof Spain suffered also from epidemic pestilence; so much so, that on\r\nthe 7th of January, 1466, the Council of Ciento voted that the Feast of\r\nSt. Sebastian should not be observed, on account of the epidemic which\r\nwas raging at Barcelona. Further, on Thursday, the 13th, the Council\r\nof Thirty-two determined that an image of the guardian angel should\r\nbe erected; and on the 17th of November following there was a solemn\r\nprocession ordered.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1468, epidemic pestilence raged at Parma.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1471, Pope Sextus erected a brothel at Rome, and the\r\nRoman prostitutes paid him a weekly tax, which amounted to 20,000\r\nducats a year.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1472, a comet was seen. The year following, 1473,\r\nexcessive heat and drought prevailed, which persisted for three years.\r\nAbout this period, 1474, the city of Valencia suffered from a severe\r\nepidemic. Luis Alcanyis, a famous Valencian physician, published a\r\ntreatise in the Limosin language (that of the Troubadours), without\r\ngiving either the place of printing or the year of publication; but\r\nit seems that he flourished about this period (1474), and that his\r\ntreatise was written in consequence of the epidemic under notice:\r\nit was entitled, ‘Regiment preservatiu é curatiu de la Pestilencia,\r\ncompost per Mestre Luis Alcanyis, Mestre en Medicina.’\r\n\r\nA.D. 1475–76, the Danube was fordable in Hungary, and swarms\r\nof locusts destroyed all vegetation there and in Poland. The second\r\npestilence, which devastated the island of Mallorca, according to the\r\nauthority of Don Vincente Mut, occurred. A Board of Health was formed\r\nby the governor of Mallorca, Don Berengario Blanels, in order to\r\nprescribe rules for government and remedial measures. This ‘Morbeira,’\r\nor Board of Health, was composed of a magistrate, a knight, a\r\nphysician, a surgeon, a tradesman, and a merchant. Quarantine for forty\r\ndays was established. In this year there was published a work entitled\r\n‘De Epidemiâ et Peste, Magistri Vallestii Tarentini, Artium Medicinæque\r\nDoctoris eximii,’ which was translated by Dr. Juan Villar into the\r\nCastilian language. In the latter year (1476), the Council of One\r\nHundred ordered an imprecatory chapel to be consecrated at St. Roque,\r\nin consequence of the prevalence of a terrible plague at Barcelona,\r\nwhich lasted from the 27th of March until the 13th of November. On the\r\n13th of July in the same year, a solemn procession took place, in which\r\nwere exhibited the bodies of St. Severus and St. Innocent.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1477, in the reign of their Catholic majesties Don\r\nFernando de Aragon and Doña Isabel de Castilla, there broke out a\r\nwretched pestilence of leprosy, which may be said to have prevailed\r\nepidemically, so numerous were the cases. The duty of examining those\r\naffected, and of expelling them from the cities and villages, was a\r\ntask exclusively imposed on the priests, in accordance with divine\r\nauthority, as laid down in Leviticus chap. xiii. Epidemic pestilence,\r\nattended with bubo, prevailed in Italy, and raged without interruption\r\nuntil 1485. Swarms of locusts committed great ravages in various parts\r\nof the South of Europe, from the year 1478 until 1482. Within this\r\nperiod, say in the years 1480 and 1481, malignant epidemics appeared\r\nin the train of drought and famine in Switzerland and Germany; while\r\nputrid fever, accompanied by phrenitis, prevailed in Westphalia, Hesse,\r\nand Friesland. There never had been, in the memory of the inhabitants\r\nof these places, so many _ignes fatui_ as during this period. The\r\nharvests also failed, rendering it necessary to obtain supplies of\r\nprovisions from Thuringia.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1482, France, under the fearful reign of Louis XI., after\r\ntwo years of scarcity, became the scene of a devastating plague: it\r\nraged in the form of an inflammatory fever, with delirium, accompanied\r\nby such intense cephalalgia, that many are reported to have dashed out\r\ntheir brains against the walls of their houses, or to have rushed into\r\nthe water.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1483, there was so great an inundation in\r\nGloucestershire, that all the country round about was overflowed, and\r\nmany persons were drowned in their beds. The waters did not abate\r\nfor ten days,--thus preventing the Duke of Buckingham from passing\r\nthe river into Wales to join the Welsh, who had risen against King\r\nRichard III., and consequently being indirectly the cause of the duke’s\r\nmisfortunes and of his violent death. Barcelona was again visited by\r\na pestilence, which lasted upwards of a year. The river Severn in\r\nEngland overflowed; epidemic pestilence was the consequence. During\r\nthe following years, 1484–85, it extended all over England, having\r\nfirst broken out at Shrewsbury, where, according to the testimony of\r\nDr. Caius, who resided in that town, 960 died in a few days. Some\r\nauthorities have spoken of this pestilence as having occurred under\r\ncircumstances extremely favourable to the generation of a malignant\r\ndisease, for it is said to have first appeared in the army of the Earl\r\nof Richmond, afterwards King Henry VII., upon his landing at Milford\r\nHaven in 1485. This army consisted of foreign troops, brought over\r\nin crowded transport-vessels. They were described by a contemporary\r\nhistorian, Philip de Comines, as the most wretched soldiery he ever\r\nbeheld, collected, it is probable, from jails and hospitals, and\r\nburied in filth. The disease soon spread to London, where it raged\r\nfrom the beginning of August to the end of October, having assumed a\r\nparticular type: it was termed ‘sudor Anglicus,’ or sweating sickness,\r\nand proved to be a mortal epidemic. It also prevailed in Ireland. The\r\nsymptoms were those of a violent inflammatory fever, which, after a\r\nshort time, caused great prostration of strength. There were also\r\npresent, oppression at the stomach, and violent headache, accompanied\r\nby lethargic stupor, and the body was covered with a profuse fœtid\r\nperspiration. The progress of this singular malady was very rapid, a\r\ncrisis always taking place within the space of a day and a night. The\r\ninternal heat from which the patient suffered was intolerable, yet\r\nevery thing cold, or even cool, was certain death. Two lord mayors and\r\nsix aldermen died in one week. The disease attacked the most robust and\r\nstrong, and spread without interruption over the entire kingdom, from\r\neast to west. In a very short period vast numbers of the population\r\nfell victims to this strange epidemic. Many of those who recovered from\r\nthe first attack were seized a second, and some even a third time.\r\nPersons of rank, of the ecclesiastical and civil classes, were not\r\nexempt; and great was the consternation when the disease broke out in\r\nOxford. The heads of colleges and the students fled in all directions,\r\nand this celebrated university was deserted for six weeks. Three months\r\nlater, it appeared at Croyland, and carried off Lambert Fossedyke,\r\nabbot of the monastery, on the 14th of November. During this period,\r\nepidemic pestilence was rife in Germany, Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark,\r\nand Egypt.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1485. This year, pestilence broke out in Seville, the\r\nmortality from which was increased by the heavy rains and inundations\r\nof the subsequent winter. The year following, Saragossa and other parts\r\nof the kingdom of Aragon suffered from epidemic pestilence: it was of\r\na peculiar bubonic or glandular kind, the cure of which was attributed\r\nto the intercession of Santo Pedro Arbues, one of the first Grand\r\nInquisitors of Spain, murdered by the populace for his cruelties, and\r\nafterwards canonized by the papacy.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1488, pestilence prevailed in Andalusia, which must\r\nhave been very fatal, especially in the army which King Don Ferdinand\r\ncommanded, although no correct accounts of its mortality are on record.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1489, Barcelona was again visited by a dire pestilence:\r\nit broke out on the 3rd of November, and lasted until the 16th of\r\nSeptember in the following year. In vol. i. of the ‘Biblioteca Halleri’\r\nthere is a memoir published by Pedro Martyr de Anglesia, in which is\r\nnoted a certain disease accompanied by a pain in the joints, fœtid\r\nulcers in the mouth, and pustules, which are regarded by some modern\r\nwriters as the symptoms of the French pox (morbus Gallicus).\r\n\r\nA.D. 1490, a bilious remittent fever was rife in various parts\r\nof Europe. A putrid fever, supposed by some to have arisen from the\r\nunburied bodies in Granada, raged with dreadful violence; by others it\r\nwas stated to have been imported by some soldiers who came from the\r\nisland of Cyprus, in which place this kind of fever was endemic.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1492. Epidemic variola was unknown to the Indians until\r\nit was conveyed to the East by the commercial intercourse of the Dutch:\r\nit was also supposed to have been introduced into America by a negro\r\nslave of Pamfilo Narvaes, when that Spanish general proceeded to Mexico\r\nagainst his enemy, Hernando Cortés. The inhabitants of Zempoala lost\r\ngreat numbers, and 16,000 Indians fell its victims.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1493, says Don Vincente Mut, there happened the fifth\r\nplague in the island of Mallorca; it was called the plague of Boja,\r\nand was so termed from the name of the man who is supposed to have\r\nintroduced it into the island.\r\n\r\nDuring this period, Barcelona was revisited by pestilence, which\r\nlasted from the 13th of June until the 4th of October. That the\r\nvenereal disease was not introduced from America into Europe this\r\nyear, by means of the troops of Admiral Christobal Colon, is a point\r\nwhich has been already demonstrated in history. Astruc exhibits great\r\nerudition in showing that the disease was not known before the years\r\n1494 and 1496. In the list of writers of the kingdom of Valencia,\r\nfurnished by Vincente Ximeno, we learn that a Pedro Pintor was born\r\nin that capital A.D. 1420, and died at Rome in 1503: he was\r\nphysician to Alexander the Sixth, who was also a Valencian, having\r\nbeen born in the part called Xativa. From the historical writings of\r\nPintor, and of contemporary authors, it seems evident, as suggested by\r\nDr. Sanchez, that the venereal disease, during its first prevalence,\r\nwas a pestilential fever, which was communicable through the genitals,\r\nand otherwise; and that at that period there was no discredit or stigma\r\nattached to those who were afflicted with it: it was not considered to\r\nbe _contra bonos mores_. The Valencian author, following up the\r\nastrological notions of his time, attributes the disease to the same\r\ncauses as epidemic plagues or pestilences.\r\n\r\nDuring the vernal equinox of this year, this description of pestilence\r\nbroke out in the city of Rome, as is gathered from the following\r\nquotation: “Talis autem epidemia in urbe Romanâ contigit anno 1493\r\nmense Martii, post introitum solis in primum minutum Arietis.” This\r\ndisease was first noticed in the month of August.\r\n\r\nPedro Pintor, according to Cotunnius, professor of anatomy at Naples,\r\nwas amongst the earliest writers upon the venereal disease: his work,\r\nentitled ‘De Morbo Fœdo his temporibus affligente,’ was published at\r\nRome A.D. 1500. He attributed the origin of the disease to a\r\nconjunction of the planets, and no doubt he was acquainted with the\r\ncircumstance of the disease being propagated by cohabitation with a\r\ndiseased person. Several of the inhabitants of Rome were attacked\r\nA.D. 1493, and the disease became common there until 1499; it\r\nprincipally attacked the limbs with excruciating pains and pustular\r\neruptions, against which the physicians employed mercurial ointment\r\nmixed with lead,--an invention said to be due to a Portuguese. So rife\r\ndid the pestilence become, that, according to Ruy Diaz de Isla, a\r\nnative of Andalusia, their majesties Don Fernando de Aragon and Doña\r\nIsabel de Castilla gave instructions to their physicians to attend to\r\nthose stricken with the disease, who were received into the hospital of\r\nSan Salvador. Great numbers of the first professors and physicians of\r\nthe land investigated the symptoms of the disease, and after treating\r\nit with the thousand and one remedies thought of with but little\r\nsuccess, it was considered to be a chastisement from Heaven which befel\r\nall constitutions and conditions.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the origin of this pestilence--the venereal disease,\r\nthere are various opinions. When it broke out in the French army\r\nat Naples A.D. 1495, the French called it ‘the disease of\r\nNaples,’ and said that at the siege of that place there were certain\r\nmerchants who barrelled the flesh of men slain in Barbary, which they\r\nsold for tunny! and that from such food the disease originated. It is\r\ncertain that cannibals are much infested with the venereal disease.\r\nIt was known in England before 1162, and was called ‘Brenning’ or\r\n‘Burning.’ This appears from Bishop Winton’s records of the public\r\nstews. The disease is well described by one Arden, who was surgeon to\r\nRichard II., in 1156, in a work expressly written on the subject.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1495, King Don Fernando convoked the Cortes in the city\r\nof Tarragona, in consequence of the pestilence raging at Saragossa: it\r\nwas attended by buboes, carbuncles, &c.; and in the following year,\r\n1496, it appeared in a petechial form among the soldiers employed\r\nin Granada. Syphilis also prevailed at Naples amongst the troops of\r\nCharles VIII.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1496, an epidemic ulceration, as it was then called, of the\r\nskin (epidemic scurvy), invaded the inhabitants of Germany, Portugal,\r\nIreland, and other countries.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1497, Barcelona was again visited by epidemic\r\npestilence: it made its appearance about the 18th of July, and\r\ncontinued until November. Gaspar Torella, a native of Valencia,\r\nphysician and domestic prelate to Alexander VI., wrote a work upon\r\nthe Morbus Gallicus, which was printed at Rome, according to Haller’s\r\naccount, in the year 1497. Astruc makes mention of another work,\r\nentitled ‘Ex Coitu cum Impurâ Muliere.’\r\n\r\nIn the year 1498, Francisco Lopez de Villalobos, physician to Charles\r\nV. and to his son Philip II., published in Salamanca a folio work\r\nentitled ‘Sumario de la Medicina.’ Juan de Banos, in the first ten\r\nnumbers of his ‘Voyages of the Portuguese to the East Indies,’ gives\r\na circumstantial account of a pestilence which seized on the crews of\r\ntheir fleet after they had passed the Cape of Good Hope. The malady\r\ncommenced with erysipelas and putrescence of the gums, so that those\r\nwho were attacked were unable to take food; their bodies were racked\r\nwith excruciating pains, and the stench from them was intolerable. This\r\ndisease was evidently scurvy.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1499, a great plague prevailed in Britain, carrying off\r\nthousands; 30,000 were reported to have perished from it in London\r\nalone. The king found it advisable to retire with all his Court to\r\nCalais. In Brussels, epidemic pestilence victimized daily 500 persons;\r\nmould-spots (signacula) were observed in Germany and in France. There\r\nwas a great mortality from murrain in cattle in Germany, and very\r\nextensive destruction of all vegetation by blights and caterpillars.\r\nThe inhabitants of both France and Germany suffered greatly from severe\r\nepidemic disease during this period; it assumed a glandular form, and\r\ncontinued until the year 1503. This pestilence, says Schenckius, was\r\naccompanied in some parts of Europe by famine, which was followed by\r\na most vehement intemperature of the seasons; for a winter preceded,\r\nso terribly severe as to kill the brute creation everywhere, and the\r\nheat of the summer was of such cruel intensity that trees were set on\r\nfire by the heat of the sun: in fine, this year may be said to have\r\nbeen the commencement of a century of putrid malignant diseases,--a\r\ncentury replete with grand phenomena affecting human life in general.\r\nIn the year 1501, epidemic pestilence, says Luis Lobera de Avila, made\r\nits appearance at Barcelona; it began about the middle of October, and\r\nspread to various other parts of Spain. The disease, according to the\r\nsuperstition of the times, was attributed to a celestial influence.\r\nDuring this period, the use of guaiacum, or holy wood, in the treatment\r\nof the venereal disease, was discovered: it was afterwards introduced\r\ninto Italy about the year 1517, where its utility was first made known\r\nby a Spanish presbyter. Plague again visited Barcelona, and sadly\r\ncrippled its commerce. The viceroy of Sicily prohibited the entry of\r\nshipping coming thence.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1504, China was nearly depopulated by pestilence. There was\r\nalso a great mortality in Ireland from epidemic disease; and plague,\r\nabout the same period, raged in Spain, in which country a severe\r\nearthquake was experienced on the 5th of April: it did a great deal of\r\nmischief, especially in Andalusia. About the same period a dreadful\r\nshock was felt at Lisbon, which continued for eight days, overthrowing\r\nseveral churches and more than 1500 houses, under the ruins of which\r\nupwards of 20,000 persons met their death. Several of the neighbouring\r\ntowns were swallowed up, with vast numbers of their inhabitants. The\r\nyear following, two comets were observed. Spotted fever was rife all\r\nover Europe, and pestilence prevailed in Lisbon.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of the year 1505, the sweating sickness again reared\r\nits head in England; the disease first broke out in London: it was\r\nof a much milder form than that which prevailed in the year 1485; it\r\ndisappeared towards the close of the autumn, and appears to have been\r\nconfined to England: no remarkable phenomena were observed here during\r\nthis pestilence; it was otherwise, however, in other parts of Europe.\r\nThe summer was wet, and the winter following a severe one; comets were\r\nseen in this and the following year, and an eruption of Vesuvius took\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1506. From the 15th to the 26th of January, there blew\r\na violent storm from the south-west, which drove the King of Castile,\r\nPhilip of Austria, with his consort Joanna, from the Netherlands to\r\nWeymouth; and as, some days before, a golden eagle falling from St.\r\nPaul’s Church in London had crushed a black eagle which ornamented some\r\nlower building, evil predictions were promulgated among the people\r\nrespecting the fate of this son of the Emperor.\r\n\r\nSpain suffered greatly from severe pestilence in the year 1507, writes\r\nDon Miguel Martinez de Leyva,--especially Barcelona, which place may\r\nbe said to have been scarcely ever free of pestilence. In the diary of\r\nRamon Vila it is stated that the pestilence was at its height in the\r\nmonths of April, May, June, and July. On the 14th of August letters\r\nwere addressed to the governors of Sicily and Mallorca, informing\r\nthem that, in consequence of the cessation of the pestilence at\r\nBarcelona, the royal family and the nobility had returned to the city.\r\nThe Portuguese physician Pedro Bayro, who had had much experience in\r\nforeign parts, and of whom Don Nicolas Antonio makes memorable mention,\r\nwrote a work entitled ‘Novum ac perutile Opusculum de Pestilentiâ et\r\nde Curatione ejusdem per utrumque regimen, præservativum, scilicet,\r\net curativum. Turin, 1507.’ In this and the following year, 1508,\r\nmention is made of swarms of locusts in the neighbourhood of Seville;\r\nin fact, they are reported to have overrun Spain. Epidemic pestilence\r\nfollowed, especially at Cadiz. Constantinople was nearly depopulated\r\nby pestilence, which spared neither age nor sex. Germany also suffered\r\nfrom epidemic encephalitis and malignant pneumonia.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1510, a violent and universal catarrh prevailed over\r\nEurope; in France it was called ‘Coqueluche’ (monk’s-hood), from the\r\npractice of covering the patient’s head with a cap to protect him\r\nfrom the air, which was considered very detrimental in this disease.\r\nSo general was the malady in France, that historians assure us that\r\nbut few of the inhabitants escaped.--A.D. 1511 a plague, and\r\n1513 a malignant dysentery occurred in Verona.--A.D. 1515,\r\nSpain was revisited by epidemic pestilence. A severe earthquake was\r\nfelt in Denmark, which threw down the steeple of the great church in\r\nCopenhagen, and did much damage besides.\r\n\r\nThe sweating sickness again made its appearance, A.D. 1517,\r\nin England, having broken out in London, which was crowded with\r\npoor. From a scarcity of artizans about this time, it happened that\r\ngreat numbers of foreigners emigrated from Genoa, Lombardy, France,\r\nGermany, and Holland to London, and were engaged in the most lucrative\r\nbranches of employment. This circumstance appears to have increased\r\nthe prevalent distresses of the lower orders, and a great insurrection\r\nof English artizans followed. The popular commotion was, however,\r\nsoon suppressed without any considerable damage; and Henry VIII., on\r\na solemn day appointed at Westminster for passing judgment upon the\r\nprisoners apprehended on the occasion of the riots, bestowed pardon on\r\nthem, for he saw into the causes of their discontent, and very soon\r\nafter caused restrictive alien laws to be enacted. The higher classes\r\nenjoyed no immunity from this pestilence; their ranks were thinned,\r\nand no precaution seemed to avert death from their abodes. Ammonius\r\nof Lucca, a scholar of some celebrity, private secretary to the king,\r\nwas cut off, after having boasted to Sir Thomas More, only a few hours\r\nbefore his death, that by moderation and good management he had secured\r\nboth his family and himself from disease. Lords Grey and Clinton fell\r\nvictims to this malady, as did many knights, courtiers, and officers.\r\nSo rapid and violent was this disease in its course, that it carried\r\noff those who were attacked in two or three hours, so that the first\r\nshivering fit was the announcement of death; many who were in good\r\nhealth at noon-day were corpses by the evening. This disease arrived at\r\nits height about seven weeks after its first appearance, and continued\r\nits ravages for six months. Many learned men at Oxford and Cambridge\r\nwere carried off by this terrible disease, at a time, too, when the\r\nsciences were much cultivated and were flourishing. The town of Calais\r\nwas visited, and, what was very remarkable, none but the English\r\nresidents there suffered; the Frenchmen enjoyed an immunity from the\r\ndisease, which did not even spread to any other part of France,--at\r\nleast there is no account of its having done so. This same year Germany\r\nwas visited by a brain fever--an epidemic encephalitis. An earthquake\r\ncaused great destruction in Suabia. Another disease of much more\r\nimportance appeared in Holland, lasting only eleven days,--an epidemic\r\nœsophagitis (diphtherite) it was considered to be, and from its\r\ndangerous and inexplicable symptoms it spread terror and horror around;\r\nit was so malignant and rapid in its course, that unless assistance was\r\nprocured within the first eight hours, the patient was past all hope\r\nof recovery before the close of the day. Sudden pains in the throat,\r\nwith violent oppression about the region of the heart, threatened\r\nsuffocation, and at length actually produced it. From the journal of\r\nTyengius it would appear that this epidemic extended towards the south,\r\nand in the same summer appeared at Basle, when in the space of eight\r\nmonths it destroyed 2000 persons. Small-pox raged with great mortality\r\nat this time in Hispaniola.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1518. Marselio Ficino, in his work on the plague,\r\nwritten according to Haller in 1518, describes the treatment that was\r\nadopted, consisting chiefly in the application of cupping-glasses below\r\nthe carbuncles. In the city of Cascante, in the kingdom of Navarre,\r\nthere broke out an epizootic, which caused great destruction among\r\nthe horses of the regiments quartered there; the principal feature\r\nof the pestilence was extensive apostemes on the head and throat,\r\nattended with an insatiable thirst and hectic fever. About the period\r\nof the earthquakes which were experienced in Xativa A.D.\r\n1517, epidemic disease prevailed in many parts of Spain: it extended\r\nsubsequently to the city of Valencia, and caused great mortality in\r\n1519. The public authorities, because of the general prevalence of\r\ndisease and the consequent mortality, withdrew to Murviedro.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1521, in June, rogatory prayers were offered up in\r\nconsequence of the dreadful pestilence which ravaged Barcelona. The\r\nplague raged at Dresden also.\r\n\r\nThe last plague of Mallorca, of which notice is taken by Don Vincente\r\nMut, occurred in the year 1523. Great numbers were carried off by it.\r\nThe city of Valencia also suffered from a similar pestilence, which was\r\nattributed to atmospheric poison. The year following, 1524, a bubonic\r\npestilence, as it was termed, raged with great fierceness, and carried\r\noff 50,000 of the inhabitants of Milan. The plague was also rife in\r\nthe city of Xativa, and the greatest pestilence from which the city of\r\nSeville ever suffered, occurred about this time, and persisted for some\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1525, the sweating sickness, which had been for some\r\ntime raging in England, extended to other parts of Europe, and in the\r\ncourse of five years spread over Lower Germany, the Low Countries,\r\nHolland, Zealand, Brabant, Flanders, Denmark, Norway, and France. So\r\nrapid was this disease, that on making its appearance in any place, it\r\nwould seize on 600 and upwards in a day, while of this number, when\r\nso seized, rarely more than six recovered, so destructive was it. The\r\ndistemper was generally supposed to have been caused by some poisonous\r\nquality of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1527, mention is made by Franco of a pestilence which\r\nbroke out at Xativa. Great numbers of the Imperial army of Italy were\r\ndestroyed by pestilence after the sacking of Rome; it also carried\r\noff thousands at Wurtemburg. Hailstorms were prevalent about this\r\nperiod in Italy. Cardinal Gastaldi relates that, in the following\r\nyear, 1528, the kingdom of Aragon was visited by severe plague, the\r\ncause of which was superstitiously attributed to the ringing of the\r\ngreat bell of Velilla.[1] Deadly fevers were rife in London, which,\r\nin the autumn, degenerated into sweating sickness: it invaded Cork,\r\nin Ireland, and Italy also. From this period (1528) until 1534, there\r\nwas experienced much suffering from famine, preceded by moisture and\r\ngreat heat: repeated inundations occurred, and continuous summer fogs\r\nprevailed in Italy. Petechial fevers were very destructive: the French\r\narmy before Naples lost great numbers from spotted fevers. The ‘trousse\r\ngalante’ carried off, it is said, a fourth part of the population of\r\nFrance during this period: this disease was attributed to elemental\r\ndisturbances; the spring was cold, and the summer wet, so that the\r\ngrowing corn was destroyed, and a dire famine was the consequence\r\nthroughout France, it being more distressing than the period of\r\nscarcity in the time of Louis XI. on account of its long persistence;\r\nfor the failure of the harvest continued for five years in succession,\r\nduring which period all natural order of the seasons appeared to be\r\nreversed. A damp heat prevailed in the autumn and in winter. The course\r\nof all vegetation was changed; scarcely had the trees shed their leaves\r\nin autumn, when they began to bud again and the fruit-trees to bear\r\nblossoms. The disease was a highly inflammatory fever, which proved\r\nfatal in a very short time, very frequently in the space of a few\r\nhours. In many cases of those who recovered, the hair and the nails\r\ndropped off, and convalescence was tedious, leaving the constitution\r\nmuch shaken. These symptoms were evidently the same as those observed\r\nin what was termed the ‘Dandy fever,’ which prevailed in later times\r\nin France and in the West India Islands in the year 1828. During this\r\nperiod drought, swarms of locusts, and fiery meteors were observed in\r\nthe north of Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1529, epidemic pestilence prevailed and carried off\r\nmany distinguished persons in England. Contemporaries agree in their\r\naccounts of the dreadful weather all over Europe; the winter, however,\r\nwas mild, and vegetation particularly advanced; violets were gathered\r\nat Erfurt in the middle of February: throughout the spring and summer\r\nwet weather continued to prevail; constant torrents of rain deluged\r\nthe fields, and misery and famine spread in every direction. A heavy\r\nrain of four days’ continuance in the south of Germany, in June,\r\nwas called the ‘St. Vitus’ Torrent,’ and was considered a hitherto\r\nunheard-of event; whole districts were under water, and many perished\r\ntherefrom. An universal storm occurred again in August, occasioning\r\ngreat floods, especially in Thuringia and Saxony: the sun was rarely\r\nseen through the dark clouds during the latter part of summer and\r\nthe whole of the autumn: with the exception of some suffocatingly\r\nhot days, the weather remained gloomy, cold, and wet, so that the\r\npeople fancied they were breathing the foggy air of Britain. Violent\r\nremittent pestilence appeared in Amsterdam: Tyengius describes it as\r\nhaving broken out on the 20th of September, in the afternoon, during\r\na misty foggy state of the atmosphere: it committed great ravages\r\nfor the period of five days, when it disappeared as suddenly as it\r\narose. In various parts of the German States the birds of the air\r\nbecame diseased; in the neighbourhood of Freyburg, in the Breisgau,\r\nthey were found dead in great numbers, scattered under the trees, with\r\nboils as large as peas under their wings, indicating a disease that\r\nno doubt extended far beyond the Rhine. The river fish, from some\r\ncause, became unfit for food, and the sweating sickness broke out\r\nat Hamburgh, where it destroyed daily from forty to sixty persons.\r\nThis pestilence lasted about a fortnight at Hamburgh, and 2000 of its\r\ninhabitants fell its victims: it afterwards spread all over Germany;\r\nit prevailed at Lubeck, Stettin, and in Zwickau. Earthquakes were\r\nexperienced in Italy; blood-coloured rain fell at Cremona; a comet was\r\nseen in July; and disease prevailed among the porpoises in the Baltic.\r\nThe famine in Germany this year is described by various authorities\r\nas being frightful. Suabia, Lorraine, Alsace, and the southern\r\ndistricts bordering on the Rhine suffered especially: in those places\r\nthe misery was equal to that in France. In the Venetian territory,\r\nthousands perished from hunger, as was the case all over Upper Italy.\r\nIn Pomerania, a peculiar kind of debility or lassitude affected the\r\ninhabitants: in the midst of their work, and without any conceivable\r\ncause, persons became palsied in their hands and feet, rendering them\r\nincapable of any exertion. About this period a pestilence, which was\r\ncalled ‘the English disease,’ broke out at Brussels, and carried off\r\nmany of its inhabitants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n                        FROM A.D. 1530 TO 1613.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1530, the sweating plague raged in Germany, and epidemic\r\nscurvy prevailed in Denmark: two years after, various parts of the\r\nworld were visited by what were called spotted or petechial fevers. In\r\nthe month of March, pestilence broke out in Aragon and in the city of\r\nSaragossa: Italy and Spain suffered also from a gangrenous sore-throat.\r\nIn October, the Tiber overflowed, and the dykes in Holland were\r\nsuddenly burst by inundation, to the destruction of much property and\r\nof many lives.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1531. A comet was seen this and the following year.\r\nThe Tagus overflowed in the month of February, destroying nearly the\r\nhalf of Portugal. Pestilence followed, and devastated several cities,\r\nespecially Lisbon, as recorded by Cardinal Gastaldi.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1533, the kingdom of Aragon suffered much from the great\r\nwant of corn. Amongst the preventive measures taken, was the bull of\r\nPope Adrian VI. against forestallers. Notwithstanding all the measures\r\nthat were adopted, the want of food (what there was even being of bad\r\nquality), with the excessive heat, &c., caused pestilence, which was\r\nvery fatal, especially in the city of Huesca, and, as it was said, only\r\nterminated on the intercession of the Virgin _de los Dolores_.\r\nThe year following, 1534, the city of Narbonne suffered from plague.\r\nEpidemic disease raged in Cork and also in Dresden A.D. 1535.\r\nEngland, the year following, suffered from pestilence, which continued\r\nfor three years, 1537, 1538, and 1539. Mortal dysentery prevailed all\r\nover Europe. In the latter year, the river Lea in England was nearly\r\ndried up, and pestilence carried off great numbers in its vicinity.\r\nThe summer in Europe was so hot, that in many parts the woods took fire\r\nspontaneously. The South of Europe was infested with swarms of locusts,\r\nand plague was rife in Hungary during the war of the Turks in that\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe famous Ruy Diaz de Isla published this year (1537) one of the best\r\nworks which had hitherto appeared on the venereal disease. In order to\r\navoid giving offence to any nation by using the popular names, such\r\nas the French disease, the Neapolitan, &c., he denominated his work,\r\n‘A Treatise of All Saints against the serpentine disease which came\r\nfrom the Spanish island Hispaniola; a Treatise compiled in the great\r\nand famous Hospital of All Saints, in the renowned city of Lisbon.’\r\nIts author, following the opinion prevalent in his time, attributes\r\nthe origin of this disease to Hispaniola, where the natives call it\r\n‘le llamaban, buainaras, bipas, taynas olias.’ The reason assigned\r\nfor using the appellation ‘serpentine’ is, because the disease was\r\nconsidered to be analogous to the foulness of that reptile.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1541, pestilence raged with great violence in\r\nConstantinople, and carried off vast numbers. The year following, 1542,\r\nclouds of red locusts, which came from Turkey, passed over Sclavonia,\r\nCroatia, Austria, and Italy, and alighted in Spain in such numbers that\r\nthey destroyed every green thing. About this period the celebrated\r\nAndres Laguna proposed for the cure of the plague an infusion of\r\ncarlina (white thistle), a drachm of which, after it had been infused,\r\nwas to be taken daily.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1543, epidemic pestilence visited the city of Metz,\r\ncausing a frightful mortality. Two years after, 1545, a pestilential\r\nepidemic, similar to that which prevailed so extensively A.D.\r\n1528, called ‘la trousse galante,’ made its appearance in various parts\r\nof Europe, slaying the robust and young; it was equal in awfulness and\r\nmortality to the pestilence which in the days of Moses destroyed the\r\nfirst-born of Egypt: the disease first appeared in Savoy, and over a\r\ngreat part of France; it continued until the following year, 1546.\r\nParè, and a Flemish physician, Sanders, describe the symptoms of this\r\nmalady, which was attended, as in 1528, with the loss of the hair and\r\nof the nails: its attack was rapid and very fatal. Patients at the\r\nonset suffered from an overwhelming weight in the body, and a violent\r\nheadache, which soon deprived them of all consciousness; and stupor\r\nensued, with relaxation or loss of power of the sphincter muscles: in\r\nmost cases an eruption was observed, of which no mention is made in\r\nformer outbreaks of the malady; Sanders does not, however, distinctly\r\nstate its nature. 10,000 English residents died from pestilence in the\r\ncourse of this year and the year following at Boulogne. The bubonic\r\nplague made its appearance in the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1547, heavy rains inundated Tuscany. Pestilence raged all\r\nover Europe, especially in England, Holland, and Germany. The city of\r\nDresden also suffered from it. Mould-spots and red water were observed\r\nin the north of Germany. The year following, pestilence continued in\r\nEngland and also in Prussia, causing great mortality in both countries.\r\nThe kingdom of Murcia suffered from epidemic disease, and the question\r\narose, as had been frequently the case before, whether the disease\r\nwas contagious or not: great difference of opinion thereon prevailed.\r\nPortugal also suffered about this period from pestilence.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1549, vast numbers of caterpillars appeared in Germany\r\nand destroyed all the herbage; they were followed by pestilence,\r\nespecially in the North, where petechial fever destroyed great numbers.\r\n\r\nAn epidemic catarrh, as well as dysentery, raged in France from 1550\r\nuntil 1553. There had been great death in various parts of Spain,\r\nand pestilence raged in Valencia: it was attributed to the effects\r\nof damaged grain, which had been introduced for the support of the\r\ninhabitants of that city. Don Pedro Jacobo Esteve makes mention of\r\nthese circumstances, in his commentary entitled ‘In Hippocratis librum\r\nsecundum Epidemiarum seu popularium morborum Commentarium.’ Seville\r\nalso suffered from pestilence. It was about this period that the last\r\nattack of sweating sickness occurred in London; stinking mists were\r\nfirst experienced on the banks of the Severn, which were overflowed.\r\nOn the 15th of April, 1551, the disease again broke out at Shrewsbury,\r\ngradually extending in the course of the stinking mists, or fogs,\r\nall over England. In the month of July it reached London, where the\r\nmortality was very considerable: it is stated that 120 died of the\r\ndisease in a day in the city of Westminster. Two sons of Charles\r\nBrandon, both Dukes of Suffolk, were carried off by it. This epidemic\r\nsubsided about the month of September in England, and was noticed as\r\nbeing the fifth and last sweating sickness in this country.\r\n\r\nCaius (John) published his ‘Booke, or Counseill against the disease\r\ncommonly called the Sweate, or sweatynge sicknesse, very necessary\r\nfor everye personne and much requisite to be had in the hands of all\r\nsorts, for their better instruction, preparacion and defence against\r\nthe soubdin comyng and fareful assaultyng of the same disease (1552).’\r\nAbout the same period, a mortal pestilence raged in Messina, blood\r\nbeing in many instances discharged from the pores of the body of those\r\nwho were affected, three days before death. A similar disease prevailed\r\nin Paris; in fact, epidemic pestilence may be said to have ravaged\r\nvarious parts of Europe, especially Hungary, Transylvania, &c.\r\n\r\nSenertus informs us, that pestilence not only overran Europe, but\r\nalmost the whole inhabited world. The spring of the year 1551 was\r\ndry and cold, and the summer wet; inundations, earthquakes, meteors,\r\nmock-suns, great tempests, and summer fogs were noticed: malignant\r\nfevers prevailed in Suabia, and epidemic influenza was rife in\r\nSpain. The two following years, malignant fevers overran Germany and\r\nSwitzerland; scurvy prevailed in Denmark.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1555, the summer was hot, and heavy rains fell: febrile\r\ndiseases became very prevalent in England and France, and continued\r\nwith redoubled violence during the succeeding summer, which was also\r\nexcessively hot and dry: excessive commotions of the elements and\r\nsevere seasons marked this period. The city of Valencia suffered from\r\nepidemic variola. Don Miguel Juan Pasqual, an eminent physician, makes\r\nmention of this pestilence in his work ‘De Febre Pestilenti.’ About\r\nthis period, according to Cardinal Gastaldi, when the Emperor Charles\r\nV. invaded the French territories, pestilence destroyed great numbers\r\nof the peasantry and of the Spanish soldiery.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1556, a whole province of the mountainous part of China\r\nwas in a moment absorbed into the earth; all the towns with their\r\ninhabitants were buried in the ruins, and an immense lake of water\r\ntook its place, which remains to this day. A comet was seen this year.\r\nVienna about this time suffered from epidemic pestilence, as also\r\ndid Holland the year following; the disease continued until 1558.\r\nThis disease commenced in the form of influenza in various parts of\r\nEurope, and in France, Italy, and Germany; Spain also suffered from\r\nits violence, which was greater in some countries than in others, viz.\r\nFlorence and Tuscany. In France, malignant dysentery was the most\r\npredominant malady; agues in Holland, and petechial or spotted fever\r\nin Spain; the last-named disease was as fatal as the true plague.\r\nA Spanish writer, Andres Laguna, physician to Charles V., Philip\r\nII., and Julius III., wrote a work on this pestilence, (as did many\r\nother eminent physicians,) entitled, ‘Discurso breve sobre la Cura y\r\nPreservacion de la Pestilentia.’ In going minutely into the symptoms\r\ndescribed by these authors, we recognize all the symptoms of bilious\r\nremittent or yellow fever, synocha, &c., as prevalent now-a-days, and\r\ntermed ‘Andalusian fever.’\r\n\r\nA.D. 1557. A new infirmity, as it was then considered to be,\r\nbroke out this year in Spain, which nearly depopulated the peninsula:\r\nit continued with great destruction until 1570. This new pestilence\r\nwas supposed to have originated with the Saracens, after the war of\r\nGranada, that is, after King Don Fernando de Aragon, and Doña Isabel,\r\nQueen of Castile, had conquered the city of Granada. That this disease\r\noriginated with the Spanish Arabs, was known from the fact that all\r\ntheir disbanded soldiery communicated the disease to the inhabitants of\r\nthe cities and towns, as Luis de Torro relates in his work entitled ‘De\r\nFebre Puncticulari,’ &c., to which type this pestilence belonged.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1558, the city of Murcia suffered from pestilence, on\r\naccount of which the bishops and principal inhabitants deserted the\r\ncity. This fatal epidemic extended to all parts around Murcia and\r\nto the kingdom of Valencia. The Jesuit Fathers assumed the temporal\r\nas well as the spiritual care of the plague-striken. Many of the\r\nattendants fell victims to the disease, amongst whom was the celebrated\r\nDr. Pedro de Cabera, son of the Viscount of the same name, together\r\nwith the padre Marco Antonio Fontoba.\r\n\r\nBarcelona also at this period suffered from mortal pestilence; it\r\ncommenced in January, and continued unto July, when it ceased.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1563, there was a great dearth of corn and other\r\nprovisions in London; famine and disease were the result, and 20,000\r\npersons perished in consequence. France suffered from pestilence, and\r\nBarcelona was again visited by it. Burgos--a city in which all the\r\nreverend Fathers of the Society of Jesus, who administered the rites to\r\nthe dying, perished,--was nearly devastated by plague, as noticed by\r\nFranco; in fine, many European cities suffered more or less during this\r\nyear from epidemic disease; among which were, Frankfort, Magdenburg,\r\nDantzic, Hamburgh, Wismar, Lubeck, Bostack, and Dresden.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1564, an epidemic prevailed in the form of fatal quinsies\r\nand spotted fever, in various parts of Europe. Barcelona again suffered\r\nfrom pestilence, which broke out in the month of June, and lasted\r\nunto November following. The city of Saragossa also suffered from a\r\ncruel epidemic, from May unto December, during which period there died\r\n10,000 persons in the city alone: it was supposed that the disease was\r\nintroduced from France by means of the clothes of persons who had died\r\nthere from the disease. Dr. Porcell, who was singularly successful\r\nin treating the disease, wrote a work on it, and dedicated it to Don\r\nPhilip II.; it was entitled ‘Informacion y Curacion de la peste de\r\nZaragoza, y preservacion contra peste en general, por Juan Porcell\r\nSardo, Doctor en Medicina, Zaragoza.’ The symptoms of this malady were,\r\nintense cephalalgia, sleeplessness and delirium, vomiting of bilious\r\nmatter, urgent thirst, nausea, accompanied by pain in the stomach:\r\ndissection showed nothing particular in the humors; the gall-bladder\r\nwas extremely large, and distended with black viscid bile,--sometimes,\r\nhowever, it was found empty. There was yellowness of the skin, and a\r\nsimilar tinge was observed internally.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1565, a pestilential epidemic prevailed in France, in\r\nwhich bleeding was said to have been fatal to many; the disease raged\r\nwith great severity at Lyons. Charles IX. having inquired of his\r\nphysicians the most judicious mode of treatment, they expressed their\r\ndisapprobation of venesection. Seville and various other parts of Spain\r\nsuffered from a similar disease, which, however, was not very fatal;\r\ngreat numbers are said to have owed their preservation to the use of\r\ntreacle, immense quantities of which the Catholic king Philip II. sent\r\nto the Christian king Charles IX. Schenckius describes this pestilence\r\nas having been preceded by a sharp frost in December, the distemper\r\nhaving commenced in January: the air being filled with gross vapours\r\nwas supposed to have given rise to this malady.\r\n\r\nWierus informs us, that this pestilence afflicted all mankind; it was\r\npreceded by small-pox and measles; it proved very fatal, depopulating\r\ntowns and cities, among which were Constantinople, Alexandria, Leyden,\r\nLondon, Dantzic, Vienna, Cologne, and the whole tract of the Upper\r\nRhine, even unto Basle. The malady was accompanied by glandular tumors\r\nin the neck; it was an aggravated form of quinsy, proving fatal to many\r\nin one day. The sick were taken with vomiting, followed by a swelling\r\nof the tongue,--afterwards loss of speech and difficulty of swallowing\r\nanything, even in a liquid form; suffocation and death soon followed.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1566, a pestilence began at Comorra, called in Latin\r\n‘Morbus Hungaricus’ and ‘Lues Pannonica.’ The Emperor Maximilian’s\r\narmy, while carrying on hostilities against the Turks, lost many\r\nthousands by this disease. The symptoms were as follow:\r\n\r\nIt began generally in the latter part of the day, towards evening,\r\nwith cold shiverings, succeeded in a short time by great heat and\r\ninsatiable thirst, lasting for some hours. There was pain in the head\r\nand stomach. On the second, or third day at furthest, delirium set in.\r\nThe tongue was dry and black; the teeth were covered with sordes: some\r\nspit blood; others suffered from diarrhœa. The sufferers generally were\r\ncovered with spots like flea-bites, chiefly on the breast. Stoppage\r\nof the urine was considered a fatal sign. A similar spotted fever was\r\nalso prevalent at Paris the year following, 1567, carrying off great\r\nnumbers; it raged in many parts of Europe, continuing for three years:\r\nit subsequently degenerated into a dreadful pestilence--the true\r\nplague, and prevailed for the four following years.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1568, Seville was visited by epidemic pestilence. Dr.\r\nAndres Zamudio de Alfaro wrote a treatise on this malady, as did also\r\nFrancisco Franco, a native of Xativa, in the kingdom of Valencia,\r\nphysician to his Serene Highness the King of Portugal. Franco in his\r\nwork, alluding to the celebrated poet Ausias March, whose work he says\r\nshould be written in letters of gold, quotes the following therefrom:\r\n\r\n    “Merge scient no te locas per joch\r\n    Com la calor no surt à part estrema\r\n    Lignorant veu que lo malat no crema\r\n    He jutial sa puix que mostra bon toch,\r\n    Lo pacient no podra dir son mal\r\n    Tot aflebit ab llengua mal diserta\r\n    Gest è color asats fan descuberta\r\n    Gart de la fan que tant com lo dir val.”\r\n\r\nDuring this year, 1568, the sea broke down the dykes, and almost all\r\nFriesland was under water. Seventy-two villages were inundated, and\r\nmore than 20,000 persons lost their lives. Pestilence ensued.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1570, epidemic pestilence was prevalent all over Spain;\r\nit was similar to the maladies which prevailed some years previously,\r\nand were called ‘febris diaria,’ and another, called sudorific fever,\r\nof which Luis de Torro speaks: “Nonne pestilens aliquando diaria et\r\nnostris diebus quædam appellata sudorifica visæ sunt, quarum nec\r\nnomen quidam prisci audierunt?” It was carried to America through our\r\ncommercial intercourse, and prevailed with great mortality in the\r\ncity of Mexico. Dr. Francesco Bravo, a native of Ossuna, a celebrated\r\nphysician, wrote an extensive work on this subject, entitled ‘Opera\r\nmedicinalia’ in quibus quam plurima extant scitu medico necessaria,’\r\nin quatuor libros digesta,’ which he dedicated to Don Martin Enriquez.\r\nDuring this year, A.D. 1570, epidemic pestilences in the shape\r\nof measles, erysipelas, malignant fever, &c., prevailed in various\r\nparts of the world. 400,000 persons were drowned in Holland by the\r\ninundation caused by the breaking down of the dykes. In Poland the\r\nplague, and in Basle a malignant fever, were especially fatal.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1572, the city of Augusta de Alemania was visited by a\r\npestilence, as recorded by Agricola. Dresden suffered from plague.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1574, a remarkable aurora borealis was observed on the\r\n14th of November. Pestilence, causing great mortality, prevailed in\r\nvarious parts of Spain and Italy; and during the months of September,\r\nOctober, and November of the same year, epidemic disease was rife\r\nin London: it continued during the following year, and prevailed in\r\nVerona, Venice, Africa, the Levant, and in Egypt: it persisted for\r\nthree years, until 1577. In the latter year, pestilence occurred at\r\nOxford, owing to some prisoners having been brought for trial in a\r\nfilthy state, from the foul condition of the cells: a stench arose,\r\nwhich was supposed to have emanated from their persons. Some of the\r\njudges and justices, among whom was Robert Bell, Lord Chief Baron,\r\nand many of the jurors, with the high sheriff, died; and from the\r\n6th to the 12th of July it is reported that 510 persons died from\r\nthe infection: it was termed in consequence ‘the black assizes.’ The\r\nsymptoms were described as consisting of a violent pain in the head,\r\nwith delirium; distress in the abdomen, and general prostration of\r\nstrength. Some were of opinion that this disease was generated by the\r\nconfinement of the prisoners, and that although they themselves did not\r\nsuffer from it, they communicated it to others by contagion: others\r\nwere of opinion that the disease was not in any way contagious.\r\n\r\nThe Court was held in a yard of the castle, a short distance from the\r\nriver Isis, the banks of which are low. It is recorded that a great\r\ndamp breath or fog existed at the time, the weather being excessively\r\nhot and sultry. The physicians could not give the disease a name:\r\nalthough it did not appear to them to be the true plague, it was as\r\ndestructive as that pestilence generally is.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1579, the summer was moist and rainy, and was succeeded\r\nby a cold dry north wind; the winter was open and chilly. An epidemic\r\ncatarrh pervaded all Europe: it began in Sicily, and showed itself\r\nin Italy, Venice, and Constantinople: it infected Hungary, Bohemia,\r\nand Saxony, and it afterwards prevailed in Norway, and raged in\r\nSweden, Poland, and Russia. The symptoms were, violent fever for some\r\ndays,--four or five generally,--with pains in the head and chest,\r\nand severe cough, terminating in profuse perspiration. 4000 persons\r\ndied of it in Rome, 8000 in Lubeck, and 3000 in Hamburgh; and great\r\nnumbers were carried off in other places by epidemic pestilence.\r\nWhilst this fatal catarrh ravaged Europe, one of the most destructive\r\nplagues ever known began at Grand Cairo. Prosper Alpinus reports the\r\ndeaths from November, 1580, to July in the following year,--a period\r\nof eight months,--to have amounted to 500,000. It has frequently been\r\nobserved that epidemic anginas, catarrhs, measles, &c., generally\r\nprecede great and destructive plagues or pestilences,--a fact that\r\nhas been frequently noticed in our day. The terrible pestilence\r\ncholera, of 1817 and subsequent years, was preceded by influenza,\r\n&c. For the constitution of the seasons, by which these diseases are\r\ncaused, becomes increased in its malignancy and powers by the repeated\r\naccumulation of the peculiar poison, and it consequently induces\r\nthe highest gradation of disease, pestilence, or plague,--all these\r\ndistempers being essentially similar, differing in appearance only, as\r\nmodified by climate, season, &c., and also by the duration and energy\r\nof various efficient causes. This year the plague raged at Marseilles.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1580, a comet was seen. In the month of August, epidemic\r\ncatarrh broke out in Spain, and raged with such violence at Madrid,\r\nthat it almost depopulated the city. Variola prevailed principally\r\namongst children, to whom it was fatal in the city of Seville. The year\r\nfollowing, this city suffered from plague.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1582, epidemic pestilence prevailed in various parts\r\nof Spain; Cadiz suffered greatly. Dr. Juan de Carmona, a celebrated\r\nphysician and philosopher, wrote a work on the disease, entitled\r\n‘Tractatus de Peste ac Febribus cum puncticulis, _vulgò_\r\ntabardillo.’ In this work, which was dedicated to the Inquisitorial\r\nTribunal of Llerena, the author endeavoured to show that the\r\npuncticular fever was unknown to the ancients, and that bleeding from\r\nthe arm was of great service in pestilential fevers: he states that\r\nby this method he treated more than 10,000 persons, and always with\r\nfortunate results, provided the practice was not contra-indicated by\r\nthe presence of buboes, carbuncles, and menstrual or hemorrhoidal\r\nfluxes; he did not find the celebrated bezoar stone so efficacious as\r\nit was represented to be, although it was in great repute amongst the\r\npractitioners of Seville and other parts.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1582, an earthquake was felt at Peru for 500 leagues,\r\nsome time after the city of Arequipa was overthrown. Pestilence\r\ncontinued to prevail in various provinces of Spain the following year,\r\n1583, with carbuncles, anginas, &c. Francisco Valles speaks of leprosy\r\nin his work entitled ‘De iis quæ scripta sunt phisice in libris sacris,\r\nsive de sacra philosophia.’ Plague, famine, and war destroyed numbers,\r\nthis year, in Flanders, and epidemic pestilence ravaged Moravia, and\r\nwas rife in London, Germany, and Holland. Egypt and Rome also suffered\r\nfrom famine and disease.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1585 and 1586, the winters were severe, and the summers\r\ndry and hot; famine ensued; universal catarrh with general pestilence\r\nfollowed, and prevailed all over Europe. The plague raged at Narva\r\nand Revel, in Livonia, in the Gulf of Finland, 59° of north latitude:\r\n6000 persons died at Revel. Thuanus considered that the disease arose\r\nfrom the effects of war and the inclemencies of the weather--“a belli\r\nincommoditationibus et cœli inclementiâ.” In the archbishopric of\r\nToledo small-pox broke out: the disease was remarkable, inasmuch as\r\nalmost all who were attacked were old persons, according to Andres de\r\nLeon; ‘en su practico de morbo Gallico.’ Plague raged in Dresden in\r\nboth these years. On the 9th of July in the latter year, 1586, a severe\r\nearthquake was felt, which shook Lima, and ran 170 leagues along the\r\ncoast, and 50 leagues across the mountainous parts.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1587, epidemic small-pox broke out in the city of\r\nMadrid: 5000 persons and upwards died of it in a short time. The two\r\nfollowing years, 1588 and 1589, a pestilence, similar to that of 1583,\r\nappeared, and lasted three years: it committed frightful devastation in\r\nSeville and its neighbourhood. In the latter year, plague prevailed in\r\nBarcelona, and lasted from June to December; it was supposed to have\r\nbeen imported from France.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1590. A comet was seen this year during the reign\r\nof Philip II. The city of Valladolid was attacked with petechial\r\npestilence. The celebrated Francisco Valles de Covarrubias depended\r\nprincipally on local depletion by means of cupping-glasses for its\r\ntreatment. A dispute arose this year among the Italian physicians as\r\nto the virtue of blisters in the treatment of the plague which was\r\nprevailing there.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1592 the drought was extreme, and the autumn was\r\nsultry and variable. The river Thames was fordable at London, and\r\nepidemic pestilence destroyed 18,000 persons in that city. Various\r\nother parts of England also suffered from it, especially Shropshire,\r\nwhere it was very fatal. The city of Dresden suffered from plague in\r\nthis and the preceding year, 1591.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1593, the island of Malta was ravaged by plague: the\r\nyear following, the city of Seville was visited by pestilence, which,\r\naccording to the authority of Rosell and Bezon, lasted for the four\r\nconsecutive years, 1594–97. Pestilence was also rife in many provinces\r\nof Spain, especially in the year 1596. A comet was observed.\r\n\r\nMalignant fevers prevailed in England about these periods, and London\r\nwas devastated by pestilence in 1599, as was also Lichfield, Leicester,\r\nKendal, Carlisle, Penrith, and Richmond. Pegu, in Asia, was nearly\r\ndepopulated the same year by famine and disease. Constantinople\r\nsuffered from pestilence: seventeen princesses, sisters of the Sultan\r\nMahommed, were carried off, three dying in one day. A mortal pestilence\r\ndestroyed much cattle in Italy, and plague carried off 70,000 of the\r\ninhabitants of Lisbon and Spain.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1600 and 1602, great numbers perished in Muscovy; it is\r\nrecorded that 500,000 died of famine and plague, and in Livonia 30,000\r\nare said to have been carried off. In the latter year, 1602, the summer\r\nand winter were cold and dry. Catarrh and acute fevers epidemically\r\nscourged the human race; great famine prevailed for a series of years,\r\nthe crops having failed for several years successively. In Muscovy\r\nthe plague raged for three years; parents devoured their children;\r\nand cats, rats, dogs, &c., were also used for food: all the ties of\r\nnature seem to have been forgotten during this dreadful suffering;\r\nthe powerful overcame the weak, and human flesh was exposed for sale\r\nin the shambles in the markets. Multitudes were found dead with their\r\nmouths filled with straw and other filthy substances. Sacred history\r\naffords us similar examples of wretchedness,--parents devouring their\r\nchildren (2 Kings vi.); it occurred during the siege of Samaria by\r\nBen-hadad, king of Syria, (verses 28, 29,) “And the king said unto her,\r\nWhat aileth thee? And she answered, This woman said unto me, Give thy\r\nson, that we may eat him to-day, and we will eat my son to-morrow. So\r\nwe boiled my son, and did eat him: and I said unto her on the next day,\r\nGive thy son, that we may eat him; and she hath hid her son.” Similar\r\ndisasters happened at the siege of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar (Ezekiel\r\nv. 10).\r\n\r\nAbout this period, 1600, the city of Granada was visited by\r\npestilential epidemics, which were very fatal; Fernando Bustos\r\ngives an account of them. Gallicia suffered from epidemic\r\nsmall-pox.--A.D. 1601, plague visited the city of Seville;\r\nit carried off many of the higher classes.--A.D. 1602, in\r\nthe middle of March, pestilence broke out in the city of Jaen; the\r\nprincipal symptoms were those of the true plague, attended by buboes\r\nand glandular swellings: this pestilence soon extended to Seville,\r\nMadrid, Valladolid, Burgos, Saragossa, Toledo, Cordova, Malaga, Velez,\r\nEcija, Antequera, Granada, Andujar, and to other places.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1603, plague prevailed in England; 36,000 of the\r\ninhabitants of London perished by it. A similar pestilence raged at\r\nParis, continuing for three or four years, and carrying off weekly 2000\r\npersons during some portion of that time. This pestilence was supposed\r\nby the physicians to have been imported into London, notwithstanding\r\nthe inclement seasons, and the famine and disease amongst the\r\ncattle, dumb animals, and even among dogs. The year following, 1604,\r\nthe puncticular fever extended and raged with great violence all\r\nover Spain, attacking old and young; none escaping. A.D.\r\n1605, various parts of Spain were afflicted by epidemic pestilence,\r\nespecially Arbucias, where it was very fatal.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1606. Epidemic pestilence prevailed all over Europe this\r\nyear, and continued for some years after; it extended to America,\r\nwhere it attacked the company of emigrants taken out by George Popham,\r\nwho were settled at a place in America called Sagadahoe, a patent\r\nhaving been granted by King James to some London merchants to form a\r\nsettlement there. Hutchison, Purchas, and Gorges, in their histories\r\nof New England and Massachusetts, describe this unfortunate adventure.\r\nVarious provinces in Spain suffered from bubonic pestilence, which\r\nwas remarkable as having been confined principally to children; great\r\nmortality from it occurred at Barcelona.\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that a mortal pestilence broke out in the fleet\r\nof Sir Thomas Gates and Sir George Somers, who were on their way\r\nto Virginia in America. It was a spotted fever, with yellowness of\r\nthe skin, attended by bilious vomiting, hemorrhages, &c.,--symptoms\r\nwhich characterize yellow fever in the present day. It raged with an\r\nintensity equal to the true plague: it was preceded by bad weather\r\nand gales of wind lasting four days, which, with the crowded state of\r\nthe ships, was sufficient to account for all their sufferings. The\r\nvessel in which Sir George Somers embarked was wrecked on the island of\r\nBermuda, where Sir George died of the pestilence. The weather during\r\nthis period was very inclement in England: heavy rains and inundations\r\nof the Severn deluged the country round about Bristol: epidemic\r\npestilence soon after followed in Somersetshire and Norfolk. A comet\r\nwas seen this year.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1609, in the month of July, pestilence broke out in the\r\ncities of Citaro, Potraso, Castelnuovo, Padua, and other places of\r\nVenice and Albania,--in fact, throughout the entire jurisdiction of\r\nRagusa. In August, the pestilence extended to Seville.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1610, plague showed itself in the suburbs of the city\r\nof Granada, to which place it soon extended, causing great mortality.\r\nThe year following, it prevailed in various parts of Spain, and\r\nConstantinople suffered awfully from pestilence about the same time;\r\nit carried off 200,000 of the inhabitants. “Such clouds, or swarms, of\r\ngrasshoppers,” says Short, “so plagued their city and country about,\r\nthat they darkened the sun, and left not any green herb or leaf in all\r\nthe country; they entered the bedchambers; they were nearly as large\r\nas dormice, and had red wings.” The year following, 1611, Goelenius\r\nwrites, in his account of the plague which raged at Hesse and other\r\nparts of Germany, followed by a great pestilence among pigs and cattle\r\nin 1612, that a sudden and amazing quantity of spiders appeared; swarms\r\nof locusts laid waste the vegetable kingdom in Provence, tempests\r\ndestroyed great numbers of shipping at sea, many dead bodies were\r\ndrifted on the English shores as also on the shores of Holland, and\r\na province, under the dominion of France, was nearly destroyed by\r\ninundation. The summer in England was hot and dry, and malignant fevers\r\ncarried off great numbers.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1613, epidemic pestilence occurred in various parts of\r\nFrance; and in Montpelier there was a malignant fever, with livid spots\r\nand carbuncles. Riverius states, that one-third of those who were\r\nattacked with it died. At Lausanne, where pestilence raged with great\r\nviolence, there was such an abundance of flies as was never remembered\r\nto have occurred previously,--“tanta ubique fuit muscarum copia, ut\r\npost hominum memoriam vix similis visa fuerit.” (Hildanus.) Pestilence\r\nalso raged at Constantinople, where the physicians, supposing that\r\nthe cats spread the contagion, advised the Emperor, Achmet I., to\r\ntransport them to the desert island of Scutari. Spain, this year,\r\nsuffered from malignant sore-throat, which raged with such severity,\r\nthat it was considered to have been more fatal than in the year of the\r\n_garratillos_ (quinsy). The year following, the winter was very\r\nsevere, the summer cold and wet, and the autumn variable. The most\r\ndeadly small-pox laid waste Crete, Alexandria, Calabria, Turkey, Italy,\r\nDalmatia, Venice, Germany, France, Poland, Flanders, Persia, and Asia;\r\nit prevailed also, with great severity, in England. In some of these\r\ncountries, measles was also prevalent. The mortality from the natural\r\nsmall-pox, at that period, equalled in fatality the plague in its worst\r\nform. About this period, water was first brought by means of the New\r\nRiver to London by Sir Hugh Middleton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n                        FROM A.D. 1616 TO 1704.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1616, Germany was greatly troubled with epidemic agues.\r\nTwo years after, violent tempests, inundations, volcanic eruptions,\r\nmeteors, &c. distinguished this pestilential period or season. A\r\nmalignant angina prevailed at Naples: the plague infested Bergen,\r\nNorway, Denmark, Egypt, the Levant, and many other places; and a\r\nterrible yellow pestilence, in both North and South America, swept\r\naway thousands of the Aborigines (Indians). Hutchison says, that the\r\nMassachusetts tribe in North America, consisting of 30,000 persons, was\r\nreduced to 300! Gorges writes, that the disease occurred in the summer\r\nand autumn for several years, commencing A.D. 1618, and ending\r\nin 1623. This distemper the Indians described as a spotted putrid\r\nfever, with ulcers, and yellowness of the skin and eyes, and bleeding\r\nfrom the mouth and ears. This pestilence must have been of domestic\r\norigin, as no known intercourse had been held with any part of this new\r\ncontinent; it evidently was endemic--a bilious pestilence.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1617, a terrible inundation occurred in Catalonia in\r\nSpain, from continued heavy rains, during which more than 50,000\r\npersons lost their lives: the year following, a comet appeared. From\r\nthis time until 1623, Malta, Naples, Hungary, France, and England\r\nsuffered from epidemic diseases, such as small-pox, plague, &c. Seville\r\nwas visited by gangrenous sore-throat about this time; and in 1619,\r\nmany places in the Levant suffered from epidemic pestilence. In 1620,\r\nAntonio de Fonseca, a Portuguese physician of the city of Lisbon, wrote\r\na work entitled ‘De Epidemiâ febrili, grassante in exercitû Regis\r\nCatholici in inferiori Palatinato.’ During this year a heavy snow-storm\r\nwas experienced, which continued for thirteen nights and days; upwards\r\nof 20,000 sheep in one district, Eskdale Moor, were destroyed by it and\r\nfamine conjoined.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1622, London was visited by epidemic pestilence, which\r\ncontinued for four years. In the first year there died 8000; in the\r\nsecond, 11,000; in the third, 12,000; and in the fourth, 35,417. Plague\r\nalso broke out about this period in Amsterdam, and persisted, as it is\r\nstated, eight years. Pestilence was prevalent in many parts of Spain.\r\nIn July, the Council of One Hundred, at Barcelona, received advice that\r\npestilence had broken out at Argel; orders were given, in consequence,\r\nfor the exclusion of all slaves and goods coming thence.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1625, plague broke out in London, and raged with varied\r\nintensity all over England; 30,000 persons were carried off by it in\r\nLondon alone. Epidemic disease also prevailed in Italy, Denmark, and\r\nEgypt. Inundations occurred in Spain. In the month of January, the\r\nriver Tormes departed from its bed, destroying cattle and houses in\r\nSalamanca. Seville suffered similarly from the overflowing of the\r\nGuadalquivir; and in the year following, 1626, pestilence carried off\r\n60,000 persons at Lyons. France continued to suffer from pestilence the\r\ntwo following years.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1629, epidemic pestilence broke out in Narbonne; it also\r\nprevailed at Amsterdam, and at Cambridge in England, where it raged\r\nmortally: yellow pestilence was rife at the same time in America, and\r\nplague raged at Marseilles.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1630, the principality of Catalonia suffered from plague\r\nin different parts: Drs. Mas, Mox, and Rosell described the disease in\r\ntheir works: its symptoms were those of the malady which we now term\r\nAndalusian fever,--a yellow bilious fever. The city of Guadix suffered\r\nfrom pestilence of the puncticular type at the same time: it continued\r\nthere for two years and upwards. Gangrenous ergotism prevailed in many\r\nof the provinces of France, as reported by Dr. Thullier, physician to\r\nthe Duc de Sully, the prime minister of Henry IV. The first symptom of\r\nthis extraordinary malady was a numbness of the legs, then pain with\r\nslight swelling, devoid of inflammation, to which succeeded rapidly\r\ncoldness, lividness, mortification, and dropping off of the limbs. In\r\nmany instances, the nose, fingers, hands, arms, feet, legs, thighs,\r\nsphacelated spontaneously, and dropped off. The following extraordinary\r\naccount of a similar disease occurring in a family at Watlesham, in\r\nSuffolk, was transmitted to the Royal Society of London, and published\r\nin its ‘Transactions’ for the year 1762. The report was drawn up by\r\nCharlton Wollaston, M. D., F. R. S.: it was as follows:\r\n\r\nJohn Downing, a labourer at Watlesham, in the month of January, 1762,\r\nhad a wife and six children; the eldest, a girl about fifteen years of\r\nage, the youngest aged four months; at that time all were very well, as\r\nthe man himself and neighbours assured Dr. Wollaston. On Sunday, the\r\n10th of January, the eldest girl complained in the morning of a pain\r\nin her left leg, particularly in the calf, increasing severely towards\r\nevening. The same evening another girl (her sister), ten years old,\r\ncomplained also of violent pain in the leg. On the Monday the mother\r\nand another child, and on the Tuesday all the rest of the family,\r\nexcept the father, were affected in the same manner. Their pains were\r\nexcessive, insomuch that the whole neighbourhood was alarmed by the\r\nloudness of their shrieks. The left leg only in most of the cases was\r\naffected; but in some, both legs were diseased. The infant was removed\r\nfrom its mother’s breast as soon as it fell ill, and survived only a\r\nfew weeks. The nurse told Dr. Wollaston that it, too, seemed to be in\r\nviolent pain, and that its legs became black before death.\r\n\r\nDr. Wollaston’s inquiries were very minute; he was told that in about\r\nfour, five, or six days, the diseased leg became somewhat less painful,\r\nand gradually turned black, appearing at first covered with spots as\r\nif it had been bruised; then commenced the affection of the other\r\nleg, with the same excruciating pains, and in a few days thereafter\r\nthat also began to mortify: in a very little time both legs were\r\nperfectly sphacelated: the mortified parts separated from the sound\r\nspontaneously, the attending surgeon having in most of the cases no\r\nother trouble than merely to saw through the bone, with little or no\r\npain to the patient: the separation took place generally about two\r\ninches below the knee; in some, rather lower, and in one instance the\r\nfeet separated at the ankles without any surgical aid; in others the\r\nseparation was less perfect. The eldest girl had one leg taken off, and\r\nthe other was entirely sphacelated, but the surgeon delayed removing\r\nit, owing to a large abscess which had formed under the hamstrings,\r\nattended with a swelling of the thigh. The mother’s right foot came\r\noff at the ankle-joint, while the other leg, wasted to the bone, was\r\nblack and extremely fœtid, what little remained of flesh being quite\r\nputrid and almost dried. In one child alone was one of the legs saved,\r\nbut with the loss, however, of two toes even from that. Three of the\r\nchildren lost both legs, and another child both its feet. The father\r\nwas attacked about two weeks after the rest of the family, but in a\r\nslighter degree, the pain being confined to two fingers of his right\r\nhand, which turned blackish and withered for some time, but then got\r\nbetter, and he recovered the use of them.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that during the time of this dreadful calamity the\r\nwhole family are said to have appeared well in some respects; that is\r\nto say, they ate heartily, and even slept well when the pain began to\r\nabate. When Dr. Wollaston saw them, they all seemed free from febrile\r\nsymptoms, except the girl already mentioned, who had an abscess in the\r\nham. The mother looked emaciated, and had but very little use of her\r\nhands. The rest of the family seemed well; one poor boy in particular\r\nlooked as healthy and florid as possible, and was sitting on his bed,\r\nquite jolly, drumming with his stumps!\r\n\r\nOn inquiry, it was evident that this disease proceeded from eating\r\nbread made from spoiled wheat. Another labouring man, who had eaten of\r\nthe same bread, was affected with a numbness in both hands for about\r\nfour weeks from the 9th of January: they were continually cold, and the\r\nskin peeled off his fingers’ ends: one thumb, he says, remains without\r\nany sensation. A nurse who had lived with them from the beginning of\r\ntheir illness was not affected.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1631, there was an eruption of Mount Vesuvius. An\r\nerysipelatous epidemic was prevalent in various parts of Europe. In\r\nthe month of April a decree was published in Spain prohibiting all\r\nintercourse with France, where pestilence was rife. The year following,\r\n1632, a similar decree was published prohibiting intercourse with\r\nNarbonne. Plague broke out at Dresden, and continued until the year\r\n1637. A.D. 1633, Newcastle-upon-Tyne was inundated; many lives\r\nand much property were destroyed. The year following, 1634, plague\r\nraged with great violence at Ratisbon; and in 1635, epidemic pestilence\r\ncarried off 20,000 of the inhabitants of Leyden; it also was very fatal\r\nin many parts of Germany.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1636, frequent and excessive rains induced epidemic\r\nfevers during the summer and autumn in Barcelona and in other parts\r\nof Spain; plague raged in London, destroying 10,000 persons. Nemiguen\r\nsuffered greatly from disease. Epidemic pestilence was also rife in\r\nEgypt; and, according to Diemmerbroeck’s account, also in Holland and\r\nDenmark. Constantinople with Natolia suffered greatly from disease of\r\na similar kind.--A.D. 1638, malignant fevers with small-pox\r\nprevailed in the United States, and also along the coasts of South\r\nAmerica: and a new disease, which continued for ten years, attacked the\r\ninhabitants, principally on the coasts of St. Andres, Malaga, Puerto de\r\nSanta Maria, and Xeres de la Frontera. Many provinces in the interior\r\nalso suffered from it, as Burgos, Nieto, Viana, and other cities of\r\nNavarette. A severe earthquake was felt at Naples and in Sicily; it\r\nswallowed up several towns and more than 30,000 persons: it occurred\r\nin the month of March. The year following there was a severe frost in\r\nEngland, which continued for nine weeks, commencing on the 24th of\r\nDecember. London was visited by epidemic pestilence of a severe type; a\r\nsimilar disease was also rife in other parts of Europe.--A.D.\r\n1640, many portions of South America inhabited by Spaniards suffered\r\nfrom yellow pestilence.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1642, in the month of January, heavy rains fell\r\ncontinuously for sixteen days at Seville, during which time the\r\nGuadalquivir overflowed its banks, destroying much property in Castile,\r\nas also many of the inhabitants. The settlers at Newhaven, in the\r\nUnited States of America, and those on the banks of the Delaware river,\r\nsuffered from pestilence, during this year. In the subsequent year, the\r\ncity of Boston suffered from epidemic disease, as did also many other\r\nparts of the States. A malignant fever broke out in the army of the\r\nEarl of Essex, whilst besieging Reading, in England; the king’s army\r\nalso suffered. Great numbers in both armies having died, it ultimately\r\nextended to Oxford and to all the villages within ten miles. It first\r\nappeared like a putrid synochus; after the middle of summer it raged\r\nwith increased violence and in a greatly aggravated form; spots began\r\nto appear and pustules, attended with great prostration of strength;\r\nmany had buboes as in the true plague. During the dog-days the disease\r\nwas considered and treated as a mild form of plague.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1644, epidemic malignant disease broke out at Madrid,\r\ncausing great mortality. Denmark and England also suffered from\r\nmalignant fevers, which were followed by dysentery. The preceding\r\nsummer had been excessively hot, and there were also heavy and frequent\r\nshowers, with dews at night.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1646, inundations took place in Holland, in Zealand, and\r\nin Friesland. Earthquakes were felt in many parts of the world; in\r\nChili, several mountains of the Andes sunk into the earth, one after\r\nanother. A comet was seen about this period. The ravages of locusts\r\nwere great during this and the two subsequent years. Pestilence caused\r\ngreat destruction in Andalusia: plague raged in London, extending\r\nto other parts of the kingdom, especially to Newark, Stafford, and\r\nTotnes. About the same time it likewise occasioned great mortality in\r\nIreland. Epidemic catarrh prevailed in America, affecting equally the\r\nDutch, English, and Swiss colonists. Pestilential yellow fever was\r\nrife throughout the West Indies, especially in Barbados and St. Kitts;\r\nit has been computed that in the two islands 12,000 perished. Various\r\nparts of Spain suffered from epidemic pestilence during this and the\r\nfollowing years: the city of Valencia suffered great mortality from an\r\nepidemic; it was of so general a character, that it seized on old and\r\nyoung.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1649, epidemic small-pox prevailed in the city of\r\nBoston, United States; plague revisited London and Shropshire, and was\r\ndestructive in Ireland. Spain suffered dreadfully this year, especially\r\nin the southern provinces, where, it is said, disease carried off\r\n200,000 persons. Marseilles also suffered greatly. This year, says\r\nFray Francisco de Cabrera, was the most tragic ever known in Seville,\r\nat least since 1246; the violence of the pestilence ceased about May,\r\nwhen the city was one entire hospital. There was great mortality\r\nalso at Marbella, a port of the Mediterranean. In France, a very hot\r\nsummer, with much thunder and lightning, was experienced, which did\r\ngreat mischief in Guienne, Bourdeaux, and other provinces, firing\r\nhayricks, granaries, &c. Several of the Members of the Parliament of\r\nAix were found dead in their beds after a tempestuous night of thunder\r\nand lightning; and the day following, the roof of the house in which\r\nParliament was assembled fell in, and killed several members.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1650, the winter was open, and the spring cold and wet.\r\nSevere influenza prevailed all over Europe, and was succeeded by a\r\ngeneral pestilence during the hot summer and autumn. It prevailed in\r\nthe form of ague in Denmark, and of inflammatory fever in France. This\r\nepidemic, in rather a formidable character, called by some writers\r\n‘ignis sacer’ and ‘fièvre St. Antoine,’ and by the French ‘ergot,’\r\nraged during this period with great mortality in Sologne. The disease\r\nwas not ascribed so much to the scarcity of food, as to a diseased\r\nstate of the rye. It commenced with lassitude and debility, followed\r\nby torpor, swelling, and burning heat, with excruciating pains in\r\nthe lower limbs, which became shrivelled and dark, and at length\r\ngangrenous. There was reason, however, to believe that this malady was\r\nthe result of insufficient food, amounting almost to starvation, and\r\nnot of diseased grain. The lower classes, as is generally the case,\r\nsuffered most. Pestilence also caused great ravages in Russia and\r\nPoland. Clouds of locusts were seen to enter the former country in\r\nthree different places: they afterwards spread over Poland to Lithuania\r\nin such astonishing multitudes, that the air was darkened and the earth\r\nblackened with their numbers. In very many places they were found\r\nheaped up upon each other to the depth of _four feet!_ in others\r\nthey covered the surface of the ground like a black cloth. The trees\r\nbent with their weight; and the damage sustained by the country was\r\nbeyond computation.\r\n\r\nThe city of Carmona was visited by epidemic pestilence, as was also\r\nthe neighbouring country. The disease which pervaded Andalusia soon\r\nspread with great mortality through the populations of Catalonia,\r\nAragon, and Valencia. In the month of February the Council of One\r\nHundred (Ciento) of Barcelona were occupied with the pestilence which\r\nwas ravaging Tortosa. In May the same Council declared Gerona to be\r\nin a pestilential condition. The year following, 1651, the city of\r\nHuesca, as also Alcubierre and a greater part of the population of\r\nAragon, suffered from pestilence of rather a formidable character.\r\nBarcelona soon became affected; the disease raged there with extreme\r\nviolence. Dr. Salvador wrote a work describing this pestilence: it\r\nwas entitled ‘Breve Tratado de la Peste y fiebre pestilente, en\r\nel qual se trata de su esencia, causas, dignocion, preservacion y\r\npurificacion.’--A.D. 1652, a comet was seen.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1653. In Girona, at present called Gerona y Osterlique,\r\npestilence broke out, and raged with violence. The year following,\r\n1654, epidemic disease again made its appearance in England and also\r\nin Denmark. In the month of April it broke out in Chester in England.\r\nPestilential disease at this period was also rife in Turkey, Russia,\r\nPresburg, Hungary, Italy, Egypt, Malta, Sardinia, Leyden, Riga, and\r\nAmsterdam: 200,000, it is stated, died from it in Moscow alone, 9000 in\r\nRiga, 13,200 at Amsterdam, and 13,000 at Leyden.\r\n\r\nTwo years after (1656), 240,000 persons were destroyed by mortal\r\npestilence in Naples; a great number--9000--in Benevento, 10,000 at\r\nGenoa, the like number at Rome, and in the Neapolitan territories\r\ngenerally it is supposed 400,000 perished. Cardinal Gastaldi,\r\nspeaking of the pestilence at Rome, states that it was one of the\r\nmost horrible diseases Rome had ever suffered from. The same author\r\neulogizes the precautionary measures adopted by the Spaniards and\r\nthe Portuguese. Franco, a physician of Carmona, in his work entitled\r\n‘Elysius jucundarum Quæstionum Campus medicis imprimis utilis,’ lauds\r\nas great alexipharmics the properties of the unicorn and of the bezoar\r\nconcretion.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1658, epidemic catarrh prevailed all over Europe, and\r\nin the following autumn degenerated into malignant fever: it caused\r\ngreat mortality in England and France, where the seasons were very\r\nintemperate. Epidemic disease was also rife in North America during\r\nthis period. The fever which prevailed in England was of a peculiar\r\nkind--a pernicious intermittent: it was universal, and raged with as\r\ngreat destructiveness as the plague. A similar disease, we are informed\r\nby Morton, continued for some years previous to the plague of 1665.\r\nOliver Cromwell died of it; and Morton states that his own father also\r\nperished by it, and that he himself and his whole family were infected.\r\n“Matrem pientissimam, fratres, sorores, servos, ancillas, nutrices\r\nconductitias, quotquot erant intra eosdem nobiscum parietes, ac fere\r\nomnes ejusdem ac vicinorum pagorum incolas, hoc veneno infectos et\r\ndecumbentes vidi.” He proceeds to say that the cold weather afterwards\r\nchecked the disease in some measure,--yet the seeds of it seem to have\r\nbeen by no means destroyed; for it still continued to show itself\r\nunder other forms: “durante enim brumâ, intermittentes quartanas,\r\ntertianas, quotidianas, ab ejusdem veneni mitiore gradu oriundas, fere\r\næque epidemias videre erat ac in autumno συνεχέας seu remittentes;\r\nneque mehercule sæviente gelu penitus defecerunt istæ febres\r\ncontinentes. Atque equidem hancce febrem hoc pacto sub typo συνεχέος\r\npræsertim simplicis et legitimæ, quotidianæ scilicet, vel tertianæ,\r\nmaxime vulgarem fuisse, et tempore autumnalis plus minus epidemiam,\r\nusque ad annum 1664 observavi.” He informs us likewise, that in the\r\ntwo years immediately succeeding the great plague, dysenteries were\r\nvery frequent; so that in the autumn of 1667, “civitas fere universa\r\nhoc morbo correpta videbatur, atque singulis septimanis 345 plus minus\r\nfluxu et torminibus confecti fatis cedebant.”\r\n\r\nIt was during this year (1658) that remarkable phenomena were observed\r\nin various parts of Europe. The most tempestuous and inclement weather\r\nwas experienced; and on the day on which Oliver Cromwell died, there\r\narose a dreadful storm in England, which was felt all over Europe, and\r\nfrom its severity seemed to threaten all nature.\r\n\r\nTwo years after, A.D. 1660, there was an eruption of Vesuvius.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1661, a comet made its appearance, and an earthquake was\r\nagain felt with great severity at Chili: China suffered in a similar\r\nmanner the same year, 300,000 persons having been buried in Pekin alone.\r\n\r\nThe year following, A.D. 1662, great drought was experienced\r\nin England; the springs were dried up, the rivers were very low, and\r\nan epizootic prevailed with great mortality among cattle: it was of\r\nrather a remarkable character, being a disease of the liver; a small\r\nworm (entozoa), especially in sheep, it is said, seemed to prey on\r\nthe liver, lungs, and bowels: Venice was also visited by pestilence,\r\nof which it is said 60,000 persons died. Puerperal fever was very\r\ndestructive this year at Leipsic and at Copenhagen.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1663, severe pestilence prevailed in England. The\r\nillustrious Sydenham graphically describes the various epidemic\r\nmaladies which prevailed all over England from the year 1661 unto 1680.\r\nInflammatory fevers and quinsies, he says, were more frequent in London\r\nthan they were ever before known to be. During the summer of 1664, in\r\nthe month of May, a comet was seen and a malignant fever prevailed,\r\nwhich could not in many cases be distinguished from the true plague;\r\nand in the month of June it became greatly aggravated. From the 2nd\r\nof November the true plague raged with violence, and continued with\r\ngreat mortality for eighteen months, unto May, 1666. Among the signs\r\nforeshowing the advent of the plague, it is said that birds, wild fowl,\r\nand wild beasts left their accustomed haunts, and but few swallows were\r\nseen. In the summer of 1664, there were such multitudes of flies, that\r\nthe insides of houses swarmed with them; ants were generated in great\r\nnumbers, and might have been taken up from the highways in handsful;\r\nthe ditches were filled with frogs and various kinds of insects.\r\n\r\nThe plague was ushered in with seven months’ dry weather and westerly\r\nwinds: it commenced on the highest parts of London, in the parish of\r\nSt. Giles in the Fields, whence it extended rapidly to St. Martin’s,\r\nWestminster, Highgate, Hampstead, and Acton; all these parishes and\r\nvillages were soon infected.\r\n\r\n“The disease,” says Mr. Boghurst, a medical practitioner, who resided\r\nin the metropolis during the whole period of the prevalence of the\r\ndisease, “spread not altogether by contagion at first, nor began only\r\nat one place, and spread farther and farther as an eating and spreading\r\nsore doth all over the body, _but fell upon several places of the\r\ncity and suburbs like rain even at the first_,--as St. Giles’, St.\r\nMartin’s, Chancery Lane, Southwark, Houndsditch, and some places within\r\nthe city, as at Proctors’ Houses.” Boghurst further states that “this\r\nyear, 1665, in which the plague hath raged so much, no alteration nor\r\nchange appeared in any element, vegetable or animal, besides the body\r\nof man, _except only the season of the year and the winds_; the\r\nspring being continually dry for six or seven months together, there\r\nbeing no rain at all, but a little sprinkling shower or two about\r\nthe latter end of April, which caused a pitiful crop of hay in the\r\nspring: in the autumn there was a pretty good crop, but all other\r\nthings were healthy and sound, and all sorts of fruits, such as apples,\r\npears, cherries, plums, grapes, melons, cabbages, &c.; all roots, as\r\nparsnips, carrots, turnips; all flowers, and medicinal simples, were\r\nas plentiful, large, fair, and wholesome, and all grain as plentiful\r\nand as good as ever.” 68,596 persons are reported to have been carried\r\noff this year by the plague in London alone. A comet was seen in 1665,\r\nand an earthquake shook Oxford. Immediately after the great fire, on\r\nthe 2nd September, 1666, which destroyed 13,200 houses, fatal dysentery\r\nwas very prevalent. During this period, a plague infested the island\r\nof Malta; yellow pestilence, or fever, prevailed in the island of St.\r\nDomingo, as also in many other of the West Indian Islands; Holland and\r\nPrussia suffered from severe epidemic disease: and the year following,\r\n1667, a miliary pestilence raged in Bavaria; Spain suffered from\r\nepidemic pestilence, from which no province escaped: it caused great\r\nmortality, and was rapidly fatal. Don Pedro Vasquez, a physician of\r\nToledo, describes the symptoms as being those of quinsy, attended with\r\nmalignant fever, in his work entitled ‘Morbi Essentia qui non solum\r\nper hanc insignem urbem Tolitanam, sed per totam Hispaniam sparsim\r\ngrassatur, quem vulgus garratillo appellat, Apologetica Disceptatio; et\r\nea quæ in curatione hujus morbi sunt animadvertenda.’\r\n\r\nThe same year, A.D. 1667, Salamanca and Lisbon suffered from\r\npestilence. Yellow fever appeared in the United States of America in\r\nA.D. 1668, and was especially destructive in the cities of\r\nNew York and Philadelphia; in the subsequent year, the inhabitants of\r\nNorway were visited by pestilence in the shape of malignant measles,\r\nwhich with small-pox was also rife in England. About this time, a\r\nterrible earthquake occurred at Naples, which destroyed great numbers\r\nof lives and houses in Benevento. The Archbishop was dug out of the\r\nruins, and became afterwards Pope Benedict XIII.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1670, gangrenous ergotism broke out in Aquitaine, in\r\nSologne, and in the Galinois district; it continued until 1674, by\r\nwhich time it had extended to Montagris and the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1672, in the month of December, there fell in the West\r\nof England a shower of rain that froze into ice as soon as it touched\r\nthe boughs of trees or anything above ground, and by the increase of\r\nsize of the icicles, it broke all down with its weight. The ice on the\r\nsprig of an ash weighing three-quarters of a pound amounted to sixteen\r\npounds. The rain that fell on the snow immediately became ice without\r\nsinking into the snow, so intensely cold was the weather. About this\r\ntime, a strange phenomenon occurred; while the English were waiting\r\nfor the flow of the tide, in order to land on the coast of Scheveling,\r\nthey were disappointed; as the next tide flowed but two hours, when an\r\nebb for many hours succeeded, which carried the English fleet again to\r\nsea before the return of the flow: the Hollanders were thus preserved\r\nfrom an invasion, as it were, by a miracle. In Spain, great sterility\r\nof the land and epidemic disease prevailed. In the month of May, the\r\nCouncil of One Hundred were informed that pestilence had broken out on\r\nthe French frontiers. Miliary pestilence prevailed in Hungary; and in\r\nthe early part of the year following, 1673, an epidemic of a violent\r\ncharacter broke out in Spain, which continued until 1684; it was\r\ndescribed by Valcarcel as being of a tertiary type. The disease was of\r\na mild form in the months of May and June, but increased in malignancy\r\nin August, September, and October to such a degree that it destroyed\r\nnearly half the inhabitants of Barcelona.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1675 and 1676, virulent small-pox and measles again broke\r\nout in England. In the former year (1675), 11,300 persons were carried\r\noff by plague in the island of Malta: a miliary epidemic was very fatal\r\nin Hamburgh, and, according to Escobar, the inhabitants of the city of\r\nCarthagena suffered from epidemic tertian fevers.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1677, a comet was observed. Pestilence again broke out\r\nin Murcia and Carthagena; thousands died of small-pox in Charleston,\r\nMassachusetts, United States, and a plague desolated many parts of\r\nEurope. From this year until 1679, epidemic pestilence overspread\r\nSpain; and, according to the statements of several historians, the\r\ncapitals of Granada, Cordova, and Seville suffered greatly.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1678. A comet was observed this year also. An inundation\r\noccurred in Gascony, when the water spouted in jets from the sides\r\nof an adjacent mountain in overwhelming quantities. Plagues ravaged\r\nAlgeria and Morocco.--The year following, mortal pestilence prevailed\r\nin Vienna, and in Malaga and other parts of Andalusia.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1679, pestilence and famine were rife in Germany from\r\nJune until the month of December the following year, 1680: two comets\r\nwere observed. Dresden suffered from plague, and cholera prevailed in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1681, there was a great fire in Southwark, on the Surrey\r\nside of the Thames, and 600 houses were destroyed. Bronchial disease\r\nwas prevalent in England: a mortal angina, which caused death in\r\ntwenty-four hours, raged in Italy, Poland, Switzerland, and Germany;\r\nand at the same time a petechial fever prevailed in Dublin and in other\r\nparts of Ireland: pestilence was rife in the island of Sardinia and in\r\ndifferent parts of Castile; it also broke out in the city of Esmirna,\r\nand extended to Carthagena, Murcia, and Oran, and soon after to Malaga,\r\nAntequera, Granada, Moron, Ronda, Lucena, Andujar, and other districts;\r\nand thence to Xeres, Santa Maria, and Cadiz.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1682, there was an eruption of Vesuvius, and the city of\r\nCatania was destroyed by an earthquake; there was also an eruption of\r\nEtna, which destroyed 60,000 of the inhabitants. A comet was seen this\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1683, there was a comet seen, and earthquakes were felt\r\nin many parts of England. The winter was very inclement; and the frost\r\nwas so severe at Christmas, that the river Thames was frozen over below\r\nGravesend for thirteen weeks. Epidemic pestilence broke out in Argel\r\nand other parts of Berberia. The winters of this year and the following\r\nwere the coldest ever experienced by the oldest inhabitants in Europe;\r\nthe summers were rainy, and the autumns cold: epidemic disease spread\r\nover both continents--Europe and America. Pestilence, say Drs. Sastre\r\nand Puiz of Spain, prevailed over nearly the entire world; the city of\r\nVich was greatly afflicted. Epidemic pestilence also prevailed with the\r\ngreatest violence on the coasts of Spain; the Hungarian fever did much\r\nmischief in Leyden. The three following years the summers were hot and\r\ndry; grasshoppers overspread Languedoc in France, the subsequent autumn\r\nbeing cold and wet. Malignant fevers were very destructive in Europe\r\nand America.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1686, Friesland was inundated, and thousands of men and\r\ncattle were drowned. The following year, an earthquake shook the island\r\nof Jamaica and Lima. There occurred also an inundation in Yorkshire; a\r\nrock opened visibly, and water was thrown into the air to the height\r\nof an ordinary church steeple: a comet was observed. Yellow pestilence\r\ncaused great mortality in the West Indies, especially in the island of\r\nMartinique, where it was called ‘Maladie de Siam,’ from the supposition\r\nthat it had been imported from that country.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1688. Catarrhs, pleurisies, and dysentery were epidemic,\r\nthis year, both in Europe and America; and during the following years,\r\n1689–90 and 1691, pestilence prevailed with great severity in Germany,\r\nItaly, various parts of Spain, and in the United States of America: it\r\nwas preceded in America by hot and moist weather.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1690, about the beginning of June, all the legumina and\r\nspringing corn were spotted with mildew; grapes and other fruits were\r\ndestroyed, or rendered unfit for use, and the leaves of herbs, shrubs,\r\n&c., were eaten to the stems by various insects. Much rain fell during\r\nthe first seven months of the year and after the autumnal equinox in\r\nLombardy. “All the animals suffered,” observes Ramazzini; “even bees\r\nand silkworms perished; and the cicadæ did not sing this year; swine\r\ndied of suffocation,--but the greatest destruction was among cattle.”\r\nHe applies the title ‘pestilential’ to the disease affecting men in the\r\nseason which proved so fatal to cattle. Miliary or sweating pestilence\r\ncommitted great ravages in Stuttgart, Dusseldorf, Erfurt, and Jena.\r\nBilious remittent or yellow fever was prevalent in the United States of\r\nAmerica; it raged with great violence in Charleston. Various parts of\r\nSpain, about this period, suffered from epidemic pestilence, especially\r\nPerpignan and Bellagardi; disease was also rife in Italy. A severe\r\nearthquake was felt this year all over Ireland.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1692, the summer was hot and dry, and on the 7th of\r\nJune an awful earthquake swallowed up Port Royal, Jamaica; Lima also\r\nsuffered from a similar shock: 2000 citizens were drowned in the former\r\nplace:\r\n\r\n            “Earthquakes, Nature’s agonizing pangs,\r\n    Oft shake th’ astonish’d isles.”\r\n\r\nMosquitoes and flies were generated in great numbers, and yellow\r\nmalignant or bilious remittent fever carried off 3000 of the\r\ninhabitants of Port Royal, Jamaica. The same year, yellow fever was\r\nalso very fatal at Barbados, and continued to be so for several years.\r\n\r\nThe year following, 1693, an earthquake was felt in England, France,\r\nand Germany; 60,000 persons, out of 254,000 inhabitants, perished about\r\nthe same period from a shock in Sicily.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1694, an eruption of Vesuvius took place, and Messina was\r\ndestroyed by an earthquake. Epidemic catarrh raged among men and horses\r\nin various parts of Europe. The seamen and troops under Sir Francis\r\nWheeler, sent to conquer the island of Martinique in the West Indies,\r\nsuffered dreadfully from yellow pestilence, which, during the same\r\nyear, was rife in the United States of America; the inhabitants of\r\nBoston, New York, and Philadelphia, were carried off in great numbers:\r\na Dr. Gamble strangely describes it as being a new disease; it was\r\ncalled ‘the new distemper, or Kendall’s fever,’ at Barbados, where it\r\nprevailed, causing great mortality. Miliary fever broke out in Berlin,\r\nand continued for some time: it was not very fatal.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1695, pestilence broke out amongst the American Indians.\r\nThe inhabitants of the island of Bermuda suffered from yellow fever;\r\nand the following years, a similar disease prevailed in the United\r\nStates of America, especially in Connecticut, New Hampshire, &c.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1698, a comet was seen. Spain suffered again from\r\nepidemic disease; it was very fatal in Cerdena: Don Manuel de Alsivia\r\nwrote a work describing the malady. The disease was supposed to have\r\nbeen taken out to South America; various parts of the coast having\r\nsuffered severely from this pestilence, Buenos Ayres especially, it\r\nspread to a considerable distance, and Lima was nearly depopulated by\r\nit; for it nearly devastated the country, sparing neither Spaniard,\r\nwhite, creole, mustee, mulatto, nor negro. North America also suffered\r\nfrom pestilence: at this period, a dreadful disease affected the\r\nAnglo-Americans; the inhabitants of Charleston and Philadelphia\r\nsuffered in the following year, 1699. There was an awful earthquake in\r\nChina, and nearly 400,000 persons were destroyed. A comet was seen this\r\nyear. The disease which affected the Anglo-Americans was considered\r\nto be similar to, and as severe as the epidemic which had devastated\r\nBarbados a few years previously. Fatal catarrh prevailed in England,\r\nand plague in various places in the Levant: France also suffered from\r\npestilential catarrh, and an epizootic among the cattle, especially\r\namong horses. Capmany describes the disease as being a bilious plague,\r\nwhich at this time prevailed in Liorna, Geneva, Cerdena, Narbonne, and\r\nNismes.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1700. Upon the death and in accordance with the will\r\nof Charles II., and in obedience to the orders of Maria Theresa of\r\nAustria, the celebrated and spirited Don Felipe VI. was invited to\r\nSpain. The civil wars, which arose in consequence, produced great\r\ndevastation and ruin in the land, and were succeeded by an epidemic\r\nof a severe type: it is supposed to have originated from the corrupt\r\nand irregular habits of the soldiery, who were composed of different\r\nnations; its form was that of a malignant exanthematous fever, attended\r\nwith delirium. Escobar speaks of the disease as being contagious.\r\nPestilential angina, says Bruno Fernandes, in his recent observations,\r\nwas so fatal to children, that at the commencement of this century but\r\nfew escaped its ravages, and the disease was in every way the most\r\nfatal that had been experienced for a long time: it was called miliary\r\nor sweating pestilence, at Breslau; and was very destructive to the\r\ninhabitants of the island of Milo, in the Levant. In the North of\r\nEurope it was followed by small-pox. During the subsequent seven years\r\nof this century, epidemic pestilence prevailed in various parts of the\r\nworld,--England, Scotland, Friesland, the United States of America, &c.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1701, there happened an eruption of Vesuvius: the year\r\nfollowing, 1702, the family seat of Borge, near Frederickstadt, in\r\nNorway, sunk, with all its towers and battlements, into an abyss one\r\nhundred fathoms deep, and its site was instantly filled with water,\r\nwhich formed a lake three hundred ells long and one hundred and thirty\r\nbroad. Many persons, together with upwards of 200 head of cattle,\r\nperished. A comet was seen about this period; and in the next year,\r\n1703, small-pox and scarlatina raged at Boston, United States; in other\r\nof the States they were attended with fever of a most malignant type.\r\nDuring this period the drought was extreme; the autumn was sultry, with\r\ncold damp nights, north winds, and frequent showers; bilious plague\r\nbroke out in the city of New York, and was more fatal than at any other\r\nprevious period; it was termed ‘the great sickness.’ Ergotism prevailed\r\nthroughout the whole country of Freiburg. A dreadful thunder-storm was\r\nexperienced in England on the 26th and 27th of November of this year,\r\nwhich frightened the whole kingdom; the houses in London were violently\r\nshaken, and many fell; the water rose to a great height at Westminster\r\nHall, and London Bridge was choked up with the wrecks of boats, &c.;\r\nfourteen ships of war were lost during the storm, with great numbers\r\nof seamen. The damage done by it in London alone was computed at\r\none million pounds sterling: at the same time Rome was shaken by an\r\nearthquake, and the city of Aquila, in the kingdom of Naples, was\r\ndestroyed; many thousand persons were buried in its ruins. The year\r\nfollowing, 1704, there was an eruption of Vesuvius.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n                        FROM A.D. 1705 TO 1795.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1705, in the city of Ceuta, an epidemic malignant fever\r\nbroke out, and raged with dreadful violence, causing great mortality.\r\nThe appearances on dissection, as reported by Don Antonio de la Locha,\r\nproto-medicus of the army, were as follow: “The blood was observed to\r\nbe coagulated in the ventricles of the heart, especially in that of the\r\nright side, and also in the vena cava (in the immediate neighbourhood\r\nof the heart); the pulmonary artery was similarly engorged. In the\r\naorta the blood was also very thick, but in moderate quantity: the\r\npulmonary veins were nearly empty. These phenomena were not observed in\r\nall cases, since in the majority the blood was only thickened and not\r\ncoagulated; and the cause of this difference,” observes the reporter,\r\n“was according to the greater or less degree of power of the malignant\r\nferment.” In the month of April, pestilential disease broke out at\r\nTunis: in the May following, Malaga was attacked by it; and in August,\r\nthe island of Cerdena suffered greatly from its violence.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1706, a comet was visible, and thunderstorms were\r\nexperienced in many parts of England. The next year an eruption of\r\nVesuvius occurred, and an island, five miles round, rose from the\r\nbottom of the sea in the Archipelago:\r\n\r\n          ----“His hand the lightning forms,\r\n    He heaves old Ocean, and he wings the storms.”\r\n\r\nA.D. 1708, a severe storm, with thunder and lightning, was\r\nexperienced at Ipswich and Harrogate. A universal catarrh overspread\r\nall Europe and America, and was followed by pestilential fevers.\r\nLanciscus relates that a similar epidemic appeared and raged with much\r\nseverity in Italy, principally at Rome: he describes the malady as\r\nbeginning with a running at the nose, or coryza, attended with pains in\r\nthe limbs, extending over the whole body, but felt more especially in\r\nthe chest. In the spring, peripneumoniæ prevailed; chills and flushes\r\nsuddenly seized persons, and were accompanied by severe cough, spitting\r\nof blood, and turbid, scanty urine; the respiration was laborious, and\r\na general yellowness of the body was observed. In the years following,\r\nA.D. 1709, 1710, and 1711, various parts of the coast of South\r\nAmerica suffered from putrid or yellow pestilence, especially in the\r\nBrazilian territory; vast numbers were carried off of all complexions,\r\nfrom the mulatto to the black. Seville and various other parts of\r\nSpain were visited by dire pestilence at this period; it caused great\r\nconsternation amongst the inhabitants throughout Andalusia. The\r\ncelebrated Spanish physician, Dr. Don Diego Villalon, was famous for\r\nits treatment. Plague or pestilence raged at Dantzic; a prodigious\r\nnumber of insects, especially of spiders, had been noted in the city of\r\nSeville the year previously. This pestilence continued for some time;\r\nin fact, the five following years may be said to have been remarkable\r\nfor general and aggravated epidemic disease all over Europe. Horned\r\ncattle and horses were observed to suffer greatly from an epizootic. In\r\nHolland alone it is reported that 300,000 head of cattle were destroyed\r\nby it.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1709, Sologne was again visited by gangrenous ergotism,\r\na fourth part of the rye crop having been infected with the ergot\r\nor spur. About this period, memorable for hard frosts, this disease\r\nappeared in the cantons of Lucerne, Zurich, and Berne; it also\r\nprevailed in those places in the years 1715 and 1716, and also\r\nepidemically four or five times within the space of ten years at\r\nOrleans.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1710. Copenhagen and many parts of Sweden suffered from\r\nsweating sickness this year: its victims at Stockholm were 30,000; and\r\nit is reported that 25,000 died of it in Copenhagen in six months.\r\nPestilence raged in Lithuania; and the troops under General Nicholson,\r\ndestined to cooperate with the fleet of England in the reduction of\r\nCanada in North America, encamped at a place called Wood Creek, in the\r\nprovince of New York, were affected with a sore epidemic distemper,\r\nwhich carried off great numbers.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1711, a murrain broke out among cattle in Italy and\r\nGermany; the disease was supposed to be a sort of typhus fever, but\r\nwas in fact, more properly speaking, a fatal dysentery. The following\r\nyear, A.D. 1712, a miliary or sweating pestilence raged at\r\nMümpelgart. There was an eruption of Vesuvius that year.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1713, in consequence of small-pox being rife at\r\nConstantinople, inoculation was practised: the following year, a fatal\r\nepidemic raged among the horses and horned cattle in England, by which\r\n70,000 head were destroyed: it was supposed to have been occasioned by\r\nthe excessive heat and drought during the summer months: great numbers\r\nof insects were generated.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1715, small-pox and measles were epidemic in many parts\r\nof Europe, and malignant yellow pestilence raged in the United States\r\nof America. Thomas Hacket, of Duck Creek, states that the disease was\r\nequal in intensity to that which raged in London in 1665. Miliary fever\r\nprevailed at Breslau and at Turin.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1716, a dreadful storm, with heavy rains, thunder and\r\nlightning, did much damage throughout England. On the 6th of March, an\r\naurora borealis was visible for three days. The noble city of Aguilar\r\nde Campo, situated on the seashore, having suffered about this time\r\nfrom cold and damp weather, epidemic variola broke out in the month of\r\nMarch, and was the prelude to a pestilential sore-throat, or quinsy,\r\nwhich lasted until December, 1719.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1717, there was another eruption of Vesuvius, and\r\nFriesland was again inundated. Half the province of Groningen was\r\nruined by it, and 2500 of its inhabitants perished: it occurred on the\r\n24th and 25th of December. Various parts of the country suffered: all\r\nthe Lower Elbe was under water, and it is stated that fully 20,000\r\npersons were drowned. From this period until the year 1721, according\r\nto Dr. Casal, southern winds prevailed, with dry, cold weather, which\r\nsuddenly changed to a dry heat, lasting for weeks; after this, copious\r\nrains fell, accompanied by frequent changes in the direction of the\r\nwinds. In the autumn, an epidemic jaundice became so general, that\r\nnearly a tenth part of the population of the Asturias suffered from it.\r\nPestilence in the shape of the true plague carried off 80,000 persons\r\nin Aleppo. We are told by Didier that this year the fields were barren\r\nand the fruits bad, so that the poor, among whom the disease chiefly\r\nraged at Marseilles, were almost starved during its prevalence. Mr.\r\nSecretary Craggs applied to Dr. Mead to be advised as to the most\r\neffectual remedy for or preventive of the plague.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1718. A comet made its appearance this year, and a severe\r\nshock of an earthquake was experienced in China. In the following year,\r\nan aurora borealis was observed, which was supposed to have been not\r\nmore than thirty-eight miles high.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1720, Marseilles was visited by a dreadful plague, which\r\nraged with great fury. In order to mitigate the disease, the king’s\r\nministers commissioned Don Josef Fornés, a native of Hostal-Rich, to\r\nproceed to the university of Montpelier, in order to consult with the\r\nphysicians of that university as to the best means of prevention and\r\ncure. All social affection became extinct, the consequences being as\r\ndreadful as those of the disease itself. Husbands and wives, parents\r\nand children, and the dearest friends and connexions, hastened to\r\nescape from each other, and an exclusive selfishness took possession\r\nof every heart. The symptoms of this terrible scourge were variable:\r\nshiverings were often followed by a quick pulse, which soon gave way\r\nunder pressure. The warmth of the skin was generally natural, whilst a\r\nburning heat was felt within, and an almost inextinguishable thirst.\r\nThe tongue became white, the speech faltering, eyes glaring, face red\r\nor congested, and sometimes livid; pains at the heart were frequent;\r\nnausea and bilious vomitings, with looseness of the bowels and\r\nhemorrhage, were always fatal symptoms. The most characteristic sign\r\nof the malady was buboes in the groin or arm-pit, but these were not\r\nalways attendant, especially when the disease proved rapidly fatal, as\r\nwas the case in many instances. Toulon, Aix, and Arles also suffered\r\ngreatly from this pestilence: the deaths were estimated at one-third of\r\nthe whole population! In a district of Provence where the population\r\namounted to 247,899 persons, 87,659 perished. Miliary fever was\r\nexceedingly prevalent and fatal in the canton de Bray, in Lower Seine.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1722, Port Royal, Jamaica, was destroyed by an\r\ninundation. Deadly yellow pestilence succeeded, the year following.\r\nHoffman, Schenckius, and other authors give an account of an epizootic\r\nwhich prevailed this year in several parts of Spain. About the same\r\ntime, an epidemic pestilence, much more malignant than that which had\r\noccurred in 1706, broke out in Granada, accompanied with exanthematous\r\neruptions. The city of Placentia was also visited by pestilential\r\nfever, the best remedy for which Dr. Morena found to be stimulants,\r\nsuch as wine, &c. Inoculation for small-pox was introduced into England\r\nthis year by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. The Princesses Amelia and\r\nCaroline were among the first thus treated. A sore throat, attended\r\nwith dizziness and pain in the limbs, prevailed in London and was fatal\r\nto numbers; measles were rife in America.\r\n\r\nPlague did much mischief at Vienna, Hungary, and in the East: it\r\ncontinued for two years. Dysentery raged in Upper Saxony, and ergotism\r\nin Silesia.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1723, yellow pestilence prevailed in many parts of\r\nSpain, especially in the cities on the coast. Lisbon also suffered\r\nfrom pestilence, the predominant symptom of which was black vomit.\r\nMiliary fever prevailed at Frankfort on the Maine. Don Vincente Boibid,\r\na celebrated physician of Madrid, published a work entitled ‘Breve\r\nReflexion ό crisis medica sobre el Dolor Colico, con animo de remediar\r\ntan continuos y largos tormentos como suele excitar quando molesta por\r\nmedio de un anticolico especifico, que le vence en media hora: y á\r\nveces en una.’ This physician attributed the pestilence prevalent in\r\nSpain to the use of fruit and snow-water. The year following, epidemic\r\ncatarrh prevailed chiefly amongst children in the principality of the\r\nAsturias. Palermo was nearly destroyed by an earthquake; 6000 persons\r\nperished. From this period unto 1727, malignant fevers prevailed all\r\nover Europe and America. Louis, king of Spain, died this year from\r\nsmall-pox, as did also the Duchess of Bedford. In the latter year,\r\ninoculation was practised on criminals.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1726, a series of anomalous diseases was prevalent in\r\nGranada, and caused great mortality. Leprosy began to spread in the\r\ncity of Lebrija, in Andalusia; it lasted until 1764. About this period\r\na severe earthquake shook Palermo in September, and upwards of 6000\r\npersons were buried in the ruins.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1727, epidemic mania prevailed in Spain. Dr. Casal\r\nmakes mention of its having carried off many members of the Council\r\nof Pilona. Carthage was visited by pestilence, similar to that which\r\nprevailed in the year 1637.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1728, influenza was epidemic in Spain: it was named by\r\nPedro de Rotundis, ‘un catarro sufocativo.’ Yellow fever was very\r\nfatal to the inhabitants of Charleston, United States: it was termed\r\n‘a bilious plague,’ from its severity. A similar disease carried\r\noff great numbers of the population of Carthagena and Portobello,\r\nin South America: the most fatal symptom was black vomit. This\r\ndisease made great havoc among the crews of the vessels under Don\r\nDomingo Justiniani, and of the galleons under Lopez Pintado. Epidemic\r\npestilence was rife in Poland, Austria, and Siberia. The island of\r\nBourbon, as described by Don Ulloa, was afflicted with plague, as was\r\nalso Tripoli, Damascus, and Aleppo. Scarlet fever raged in Edinburgh,\r\nand chincough in England. About this period, miliary fever, or\r\nsweating pestilence, prevailed, with great mortality, at Chambery,\r\nAnnecy, St. Jean de Maurienne (Savoy), at Carmagnola, Vercelli, Ivrea,\r\nand Biella. The seven following years, 1729–1735, pestilence raged in\r\nVienna, Pignerol, Fossano, Nizza, Rivoli, Asti, Larti, Acqui, Basle,\r\nSilesia, Thrasburg (Lower Rhine), Trino, Frésneuse (Lower Seine),\r\nVimeux (Seine-et-Oise), Orleans (Loiret), Plouviers (Loiret), Meaux,\r\nVilleneuve, St. George (Seine et Maine), Bohemia, Denmark, Sweden, and\r\nRussia.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1730, the Thames rose to an uncommon height, and\r\ninundated Westminster. An earthquake nearly destroyed the whole of\r\nChili. Epidemic pestilence commenced at Cadiz; the disorder was called\r\n‘el vomito negro,’ and it was supposed to have been imported from South\r\nAmerica; at least so states Dr. Don Francisco Fernandez Navarette:\r\nit extended in all directions to various parts of the Continent, and\r\npersisted unto 1738, in which year a frightful dysentery invaded\r\nthe coast of Malaga and Seville, and, in fact, all the seaboard of\r\nAndalusia. During the prevalence of this pestilence, animals were first\r\naffected, especially those that were domesticated; birds which fed on\r\ngrain also suffered severely, such as poultry, pigeons, &c. Numerous\r\ninsects, called by the Spaniards ‘largostus,’ were generated previously\r\nto the breaking out of this epidemic disease.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1731, a shock of an earthquake was felt, on the 29th of\r\nJuly, in China; and on the 20th of the March previous, Naples was so\r\nshaken, that many houses were thrown down, and upwards of 2000 persons\r\nwere destroyed.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1732, 1500 persons died, in London, of pestilential\r\nfever, in one week, during the month of April; yellow fever was\r\ndestructive to the inhabitants of many of the States of America. The\r\nyear following, influenza overspread Spain and many other parts of\r\nEurope. The island of Mallorca suffered greatly. This epidemic gave\r\nrise to many excellent dissertations, which were published in the city\r\nof Palma.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1734, an earthquake destroyed many houses and five\r\nchurches in China, and many persons also lost their lives; it occurred\r\nin the month of August. About the latter end of this year, in the month\r\nof October, according to Albrecht, an epidemic dysentery, with swelling\r\nof the head, attacked poultry, especially geese, in the environs of the\r\ntown of Coburg: they died with their bills open.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1735, plague destroyed thousands in Egypt; various\r\npestilential epidemics raged for more than ten years, afflicting\r\nFrance, England, Scotland, Ireland, Holland, Calabria, Switzerland,\r\nNew Spain, Aleppo, Tangiers, and Smyrna; yellow pestilence, or fever,\r\nravaged the United States of America, especially the cities of New\r\nYork, Boston, Charleston, Philadelphia, and Albany; it extended also\r\nto the tribe of the Mohigan Indians, and was rife in the West Indies:\r\nin Barbados it caused great mortality. During the winter, in North\r\nAmerica, which was cold and wet, a distemper, affecting the throat and\r\nrespiratory organs, nearly exterminated the young children.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1736, the lower orders of the population of Seville\r\nsuffered from privations and disease, especially in the suburban\r\ndistricts, at St. Roque, Calzada, and Bernardo. In the same year,\r\nepidemic pestilence raged with great violence, at Grand Cairo, from\r\nthe 1st of February to the 12th of March: more than 100,000 persons\r\nwere carried off; 7000 were buried daily for some days. On the 24th of\r\nDecember, the river rose to an extraordinary height. The summer of this\r\nyear was intensely hot in England, and swarms of gnats were so immense\r\nall over the country, especially in Salisbury in Wiltshire, as almost\r\nto constitute a plague; they appeared in dense clouds, and ascended\r\nabove the height of the steeple of the cathedral. Ergotism again broke\r\nout in Silesia, in Suborth, and at Wealtemburgh, in Bohemia. Dr. Saine\r\ndescribes the disease as beginning with a disagreeable titillation of\r\nthe feet, as if ants were creeping on them (formication), which was\r\nsoon succeeded by a violent cardialgia, or pain in the stomach; the\r\nhands were next affected, then the head--many cried out that their\r\nhands and feet were on fire: epilepsy was one of the concomitants of\r\nthe disease.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1737, a comet was seen, and there was an eruption of\r\nVesuvius.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1738, another comet was seen in February; drought\r\nprevailed in Spain, and famine and pestilence followed: the malady,\r\nhowever, was not of a mortal character.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1740, epidemic disease was rife in Ireland; it proved\r\nfatal to great numbers in the city of Dublin, and continued throughout\r\nthe following year. Lord Chancellor Jocelyn, writing from Ireland, in\r\nthe year 1741, to his brother Chancellor, Lord Hardwicke, in England,\r\nmentions the distressed state of the country at this period, owing to\r\nthe entire failure of the potato crops, which was followed by famine\r\nand disease to a frightful extent: fevers, attended with convulsions,\r\nwere epidemic in Germany: and the vomito negro was destructive to the\r\ninhabitants of Spain; it prevailed at Malaga, and in many other of its\r\nprovinces. Pestilence broke out at Tobolsk, in Siberia, first attacking\r\nhorned cattle and horses, and afterwards human beings; it prevailed in\r\nthe form of pestilential carbuncle.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1742–3, two comets were seen. In the archives of the\r\nFranciscan Convent of San Diego de Carthagena it is recorded that\r\npestilence prevailed amongst the members, nearly all of whom suffered\r\nseverely, three only escaping.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1745, a murrain broke out amongst the cattle in Turkey,\r\nand was succeeded by a dire plague, which raged with great violence,\r\nespecially in Constantinople. This murrain among the cattle spread\r\nand afflicted various parts of Europe; it was very destructive in\r\nSwitzerland, then diffused itself through Germany, Poland, and\r\nHolland, and ultimately reached England: its progress was marked by\r\nthe appearance of a bluish mist in the atmosphere. Professors Sauvages\r\nand Chaumel speak of a murrain as occurring about this period in the\r\nViverais district of France: puerperal fever was epidemic there at the\r\nsame time. An earthquake destroyed Lima and Callao, in Peru, on the\r\n28th of October; out of 3000 inhabitants at Lima, only one individual\r\nescaped.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1747, a comet was seen; and on the 14th of October\r\nthe Thames rose to a very great height. In the spring of this year,\r\nthere broke out in the territory of Huesca of Aragon, an epidemic of\r\nmalignant catarrh, which was succeeded by petechial fever. In the\r\nAsturias, in March, the weather was variable and inclement, and an\r\nepidemic icterus, or jaundice, attended with fever of a malignant\r\ntype, broke out, and continued unto the following May: it caused great\r\nmortality. Two hundred thousand of the inhabitants were taken off by\r\npestilence in Constantinople about this time. Dysentery prevailed in\r\nvarious parts of the United States of America, especially at Hartford\r\nand Newhaven; yellow fever succeeded, and continued unto the year 1755.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1748, swarms of locusts settled down in and about London,\r\ndoing much damage to the vegetation. Two comets were seen this year.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1750, two earthquakes were experienced in London, the one\r\non the 8th of February, the other a month after, on the 8th of March.\r\nThe then lord mayor, one alderman, two judges, and the greater part of\r\nthe jury, with a number of spectators, caught the jail distemper in\r\nthe month of May at the Old Bailey. About this period, a shock from an\r\nearthquake was felt at Philippoli in Romania, by which more than 4000\r\npersons were destroyed. Two years after, in the month of August, 200\r\nmosques and a great part of the city of Adrianople were destroyed by a\r\nsimilar catastrophe.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1751, there was an eruption of Vesuvius; famine and\r\npestilence were rife in the kingdoms of Isen and Cordova; the breaking\r\nout of the pestilence being attributed to the arrival of mendicants\r\nat the ports of Malaga. The year following, a terrific storm was\r\nexperienced in Charleston, South Carolina, United States, on the 15th\r\nof September, during which the town and neighbourhood were inundated,\r\nfrom which there resulted much loss of life and destruction of\r\nproperty. Two years subsequently, there was an eruption of Vesuvius;\r\nand on the 15th of July, a severe earthquake was felt in the Morea:\r\nit swallowed up many villages and their inhabitants. Constantinople\r\nand Grand Cairo suffered from a similar catastrophe on the 2nd of\r\nSeptember; two-thirds of their houses were destroyed, and upwards of\r\n40,000 persons. A mortal distemper seized on cattle in England; 30,000\r\ncows were reported to have died of it in Cheshire alone. From this\r\nperiod until 1760, epidemic pestilence prevailed in various parts\r\nof the globe; dysentery of a malignant type in the Northern States\r\nof America, malignant fever in Normandy, gangrenous sore-throat in\r\nIreland and France, and a petechial fever in Constantinople, which\r\ndestroyed 150,000 persons. Famine and plague carried off great numbers\r\nin Syria, Smyrna, and Cyprus: in the latter place disease destroyed\r\n30,000 victims; Aleppo, Jerusalem, and Damascus also suffered from\r\nepidemic pestilence. In the former place (Aleppo) the winter had been\r\nsevere, and had destroyed all vegetation; the cold was very intense;\r\nthe mercury in Fahrenheit’s thermometer, exposed in the open air,\r\nsunk entirely into the ball of the tube; millions of olive-trees that\r\nhad hitherto withstood the blast of fifty winters were blighted, and\r\nthousands of persons perished from cold. The failure of the crop in\r\nthe succeeding harvest occasioned a universal famine with all its\r\nattendant miseries. In many places the inhabitants were driven to\r\nsuch extremities, that women ate their own children as soon as they\r\nhad expired in their arms from the want of nourishment; and numbers\r\nof persons from the mountains and adjacent villages came daily to\r\nAleppo to offer their wives and children for sale for a few dollars,\r\nto procure a temporary subsistence for themselves, and dogs and\r\nhuman creatures might hourly be seen scratching together on the same\r\ndunghill, and contending for a bone or a piece of carrion. Pestilence\r\nfollowed closely on the heels of this famine, which lasted till 1758;\r\n60,000 persons were swept away by it in the city and its environs.\r\nVast numbers of horses during this year died in London and in the\r\nneighbourhood from a murrain. Yellow fever of extreme malignity swept\r\nthe West Indian Islands and the coast of Africa, as recorded by Lind,\r\nwho describes the mortality to have been produced by a pestilential\r\nvapour, which arose in the south-east of the Guinea coast, and\r\ntraversed immense swamps: in several towns, among the negro population,\r\nthe mortality was so great that there were not sufficient left to bury\r\nthe dead, and the gates at Cape Coast Castle were shut for the want of\r\nsentinels to guard them, the whites suffering equally with the blacks\r\nfrom the fatal scourge. Yellow fever was also rife in the United States\r\nof America during this and the following year, especially in New York\r\nand Philadelphia. An atrabilious fever raged at Senegal.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1755, on the 24th of April, an earthquake was felt\r\nin Peru; it destroyed the city of Quito and great numbers of its\r\ninhabitants. On the 27th of the following May, the island of Mitylene,\r\nin the Archipelago, was destroyed by an earthquake, and about the same\r\nperiod the city of Lisbon was shaken, and 70,000 persons perished in\r\nthe ruins. Half the island of Madeira was laid waste by an earthquake.\r\nThis awful commotion extended 5000 miles, even to Scotland.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1757, on the 29th of October, an earthquake was felt in\r\nthe island of Malta: a severe frost was experienced in England during\r\nthis and the following year; a comet was also visible. About the same\r\ntime a severe shock of an earthquake was felt in the Azores. The year\r\nfollowing, 1759, three comets were seen; an earthquake on the 5th of\r\nDecember destroyed Tripoli, and was as severely felt at Balbec.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1760, a violent earthquake occurred on the 30th of\r\nOctober in Syria; it did a great deal of mischief: there was an\r\neruption of Vesuvius. Until this time, extraordinary as it may appear,\r\nthere was not any such thing as a privy in Madrid: it was customary to\r\nthrow the ordure out of the windows at night, and it was removed by\r\nscavengers the next day. An ordinance having been issued by the king\r\nthat every householder should build a privy, the people violently\r\n_opposed_ it as an arbitrary proceeding, and the _physicians_\r\nremonstrated against it, alleging that the filth absorbed the\r\nunwholesome particles of the air, which otherwise would be taken into\r\nthe human body! His Majesty, however, persisted, but many of the\r\ncitizens, in order to keep _their food wholesome_, erected their\r\nprivies close to their kitchen fireplaces.\r\n\r\nDuring this year the city of Carthagena again suffered from epidemic\r\npestilence, which persisted until 1763; the disease was a tertian\r\nfever, which became very virulent during the dog-days, and caused\r\ngreat mortality amongst the inhabitants of that city and the adjoining\r\nprovinces. The island of Cyprus suffered from plague about this time.\r\nIt also prevailed generally over the Ottoman empire; Constantinople,\r\nAleppo, Smyrna, Salonica, Broussa, Aden, Antioch, Antab, Killis Ourfah,\r\nDiarbekr, Monsol, and many other large towns and villages experienced\r\nits severity. Scanderoon, for the first time this century, suffered\r\nconsiderably; the other Frank settlements on the sea-coast of Syria\r\nbeing exempt, with the exception of Tripoli.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1761, in the northern parts of the United States of\r\nAmerica, severe catarrh or influenza prevailed in the spring; it\r\nchanged its character to malignant yellow fever during the summer\r\nand autumn. This disease was also prevalent in the West Indies. The\r\nsymptoms were slight cold, followed by extraordinary prostration of\r\nstrength, laborious respiration, cough, obtuse pains at the precordia\r\nand in the chest and limbs. The malady presented the signs of a bilious\r\ndistemper, the countenance becoming yellow; insensibility or coma, and\r\nsometimes delirium, supervened, when the patient was taken off with\r\nall the symptoms of a regular bilious plague or yellow fever. About\r\nthis period a deadly epizootic broke out among the dogs in Madrid; it\r\nextended over the entire kingdom: the disease, it would appear, was\r\nconfined to the canine race, no other kind of domestic animal having\r\nsuffered from it.\r\n\r\nThe Paving Act, which may be regarded as a useful sanitary measure,\r\nwas passed in England. A tremendous shock of an earthquake, attended\r\nwith volcanic eruptions, was experienced in the Azores in the month of\r\nApril.\r\n\r\nThe year following, A.D. 1762, a comet was visible; and on the\r\n9th of February the river Thames rose to a very great height. The heat\r\nand drought this year in the United States of America exceeded all the\r\nextraordinary seasons hitherto noticed. The inhabitants were greatly\r\ndistressed for want of water; bilious remittent fever raged in many\r\nof the States in the following autumn, especially in Philadelphia. At\r\nthe Havannah, about the same period, great mortality was occasioned by\r\na similar epidemic. Pestilence also raged in Siam and in Bengal, in\r\nSyria, and in various parts of Egypt. The influence of similar seasons\r\nwas experienced in England and Ireland, and also in France, where\r\npestilence was rife.\r\n\r\nThe summer of 1763 was moist and sultry; the Indians of Massachusetts\r\nand at a place called Martha’s Vineyard in the United States of America\r\nwere swept away in vast numbers by a yellow or bilious pestilence. An\r\nepidemic catarrh called ‘the snuffles’ was very destructive to cattle,\r\nespecially to horses, in Denmark. Pestilence again prevailed among the\r\ncanine race at Madrid; the poultry died of it at Genoa, and horned\r\ncattle in France, as also in Sweden. This extensive prevalence of\r\nepizootic disease indicated a pestilential condition of the atmosphere\r\nand a disturbed state of the seasons: the disease first attacked and\r\nproved fatal to dumb animals, and afterwards man became its victim: its\r\nravages were attended with great mortality.\r\n\r\nMalignant fever at this period assailed all Naples, destroying, as\r\nhas been asserted, 20,000 inhabitants: it was preceded by famine. An\r\nearthquake was felt at Comorra, in Hungary; 1500 houses were thrown\r\ndown, and many lives were lost, the sufferers being buried under the\r\nruins.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1764, on the 26th of December, a severe shock of an\r\nearthquake was felt at Lisbon: a comet was visible. The treatment of\r\nsmall-pox was greatly modified about this time by the introduction\r\nof the cooling regimen, which was first recommended in England by\r\nthe Suttons. In the same year epidemic pestilence broke out in the\r\nprincipality of Estremadura, and was very fatal: various other parts\r\nof Spain suffered from the invasion of a similar disease; it carried\r\noff great numbers at Cadiz, and its outbreak was attributed in a great\r\nmeasure to the distresses occasioned by the Portuguese war; it was\r\na miliary fever, attended with glandular swellings, especially of\r\nthe parotids. Rain fell heavily during the months of April and May\r\nin Carthagena, and consequently tertian fevers were prevalent; and\r\nthere perished of that disease upwards of 2000 persons in the city\r\nduring those two months. Pestilential disease ravaged Suabia, and\r\nboth Scotland and Ireland suffered greatly at this time from epidemic\r\npestilence.\r\n\r\nLethal epidemic disease prevailed in Austria; and in the greater part\r\nof the United States of America bilious remittent fever, similar to\r\nthat prevalent in the West Indian Islands, carried off vast numbers.\r\nThe pestilence in Ireland was marked by all the symptoms of bilious\r\nremittent or yellow fever.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1765, on the 4th of June, an earthquake was felt along\r\nthe banks of the Ganges: a shock was experienced on the 19th of May\r\npreviously in the Pyrenean mountains. A severe storm occurred on the\r\neast coast of Britain, and many seamen perished in consequence. Spital,\r\nnear Berwick, suffered greatly from this catastrophe.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1766, there was an eruption of Vesuvius: earthquakes were\r\nfelt in various quarters this year; at Constantinople on the 22nd of\r\nMay, when 880 persons were buried in the ruins of the fallen houses;\r\na severe shock was experienced at Cuba, and St. Jago was completely\r\ndemolished, on which occasion hundreds lost their lives. The earth\r\nopened in the Abruzzi in Naples, and many thousands were engulphed. The\r\nriver Taina on the 14th of November overflowed its banks, and destroyed\r\nmore than 12,000 houses with their occupants at Montauban in France.\r\nTwo comets were visible about this period. The summer was hot and dry\r\nall over Europe, and in both the Americas; vegetable productions\r\nwere scarce in all these countries, and the winter following was\r\nsevere in both hemispheres; the mercury fell in many places 20° below\r\nzero. Malignant catarrh swept over Europe; a murrain destroyed cattle\r\nin the United States of America, the horses and horned cattle, &c.\r\nperishing, especially in New England and New Jersey. A similar murrain\r\nattacked cattle in Pomerania, Brandenburg, and Mecklenburg in Germany.\r\nThe following year, puerperal fever was fatal in Normandy. Small-pox\r\ncarried off at Pekin nearly 100,000 persons, principally young\r\nchildren. There was about this period an eruption of Vesuvius; Spain\r\nsuffered from severe epidemic pestilence. In the month of December a\r\ncatarrh of a peculiar type broke out in Madrid, extending far and wide\r\nover the Continent: it was not particularly fatal.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1768, a severe storm destroyed ninety-six public edifices\r\nand 4048 private houses on the 25th of October at the Havannah; many\r\nlives were lost in the ruins. Pestilence again broke out in the city of\r\nCarthagena, and raged with great violence and fatality. Vast numbers\r\nof caterpillars infested Northampton and Massachusetts, in the United\r\nStates, and destroyed all traces of verdure. The summer following\r\nwas hot and rainy; small-pox, dysentery, and hydrophobia prevailed\r\nin Boston and in other parts of the States: anginas were also rife.\r\nYellow pestilence raged in the island of Jamaica. In Holland, about\r\nthis period, 30,000 head of horned cattle and sheep were destroyed by a\r\nmurrain.\r\n\r\nIrregular seasons deteriorated the produce of the earth, and famine\r\nand pestilence were the consequence. A dreadful famine and pestilence\r\nin the year 1769 carried off, as has been recorded, _three millions\r\nand upwards_ of the inhabitants of Bengal. The falls of rain had\r\nbeen unfrequent and of short duration, so that every thing in the shape\r\nof vegetation was parched up and unproductive. The grain crop was\r\nalmost a total failure, and as the two former crops had been scanty,\r\nthe unfortunate people in the hour of extremity had no resource; they\r\nwere driven by the cravings of hunger to the woods, where they perished\r\nin thousands, after devouring the bark of trees and the remains of\r\nputrefying vegetables.\r\n\r\nVarious parts of Spain suffered from epidemic pestilence this year. Don\r\nManuel Antonio Bela, a physician of some eminence, wrote and published\r\na work entitled ‘Una Disertacion sobre los cometas que no causan ni\r\nanuncian enfermedades publicas,’ for the purpose of refuting the idea\r\nthat comets and other meteoric phenomena influence the production of\r\nepidemic disease.\r\n\r\nA comet was noticed this year; and the year following, 1770, was\r\nremarkable for the severity of an earthquake which was experienced in\r\nthe island of St. Domingo. There was also an eruption of Vesuvius, and\r\ndeadly pestilence raged in many parts of Europe, carrying off great\r\nnumbers. The mortality from murrain at this period was great among\r\ncattle in Sardinia, Holland, Flanders, &c. In Poland and Russia alone\r\nupwards of 20,000 persons died of famine and disease: it is recorded\r\nthat 168,000 fell victims to a dire pestilence which prevailed in\r\nBohemia. In the city of Constantinople, during this year, 1000 bodies\r\nwere buried daily for some weeks. During this and the following year,\r\n1771, a singular epidemic destroyed the foxes in the United States of\r\nAmerica. Tertian fevers of a malignant type again broke out in the\r\ncity of Carthagena, and the persons residing in the convent of St.\r\nDiego again suffered from pestilence, which continued the two following\r\nyears: out of fifty-three padres of the convent, one only escaped.\r\nPuerperal fever was fatally epidemic at Vienna.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1771, there was an inundation in the North of England,\r\nand there occurred also an eruption of Vesuvius. A.D. 1772,\r\nstrange phenomena were observed with regard to the body of Thomas\r\nBeaufort, Duke of Exeter, which had been buried 345 years in the\r\nabbey at St. Edmund’s Bury; when the leaden coffin was opened, the\r\nflesh, hair, and toe and finger nails appeared perfect and sound,\r\nas though he had not been interred many hours. On an incision being\r\nmade on the breast, the flesh cut as firm as in a living subject,\r\nand there was even an appearance of blood. A similar phenomenon was\r\nobserved A.D. 1494, when the body of one Alice Hackney,\r\nwhich had been interred 175 years, was accidentally dug up in the\r\nchurchyard of St. Mary’s Hill, London: the skin was whole, and the\r\njoints of the arms, legs, &c. were pliable, the parts exhibiting a\r\nnatural appearance, as though she were but recently dead. A dreadful\r\nhurricane happened this year in the Caribbean Islands. Plague raged at\r\nMoscow, and, it is stated, carried off 133,299 persons within eighteen\r\nmonths. Epidemic catarrh and measles prevailed in the United States\r\nof America; small-pox was rife in Scotland; and the pestilence, which\r\nwas still raging in Carthagena, extended to other provinces of Spain.\r\nPlague carried off great numbers in Bassora; 80,000 persons are said\r\nto have fallen victims to the frightful pestilence; in short, famine\r\nand disease about this time, induced by long and continued drought\r\nand excessive heat, destroyed an incredible number of lives in the\r\npeninsula of the Ganges. Baraillon gives an account of a most singular\r\npestilence with which France was afflicted in the year 1774: it was\r\ntermed Epidemic Convulsions, ‘sur une epue d’epilepsie qui reconnoit\r\npour cause le virus exanthematique malaire.’ A similar malady about\r\nthis period was rife in the United States of America. In England,\r\nepidemic catarrh prevailed to a great extent; it was attended with sore\r\nthroat. Blight or mildew destroyed the oats in Scotland, and in the\r\nUnited States of America wheat suffered from blast or blight; a bed of\r\noysters perished from disease at Wellflat Harbour, at Cape Cod, and\r\nthe lobsters disappeared from York Island, in the United States. In\r\nthe month of July, a murrain broke out among the horned cattle in the\r\nprovince of Labourd, in France, and proved very destructive. It was\r\na sort of ramollissement of the brain, according to the authority of\r\nIgnacio de Michelena, Juan de Ordoi, and Martin de Lorz. Dr. Alsinet,\r\na celebrated physician of Aranjuez, wrote a work this year on the\r\ntreatment of the tertian fever, which had been so prevalent all over\r\nSpain: his plan of treatment consisted in giving emetics during the\r\nintervals of the paroxysms, and bark immediately on the approach of the\r\ncold fit; in cases of pernicious and malignant tertian, he gave double\r\ndoses. Puerperal fever was again epidemic at Vienna, and was attended\r\nwith great mortality.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1773, the town of Guatimala in Mexico, with all its\r\nriches and eight thousand families, was swallowed up by an awful\r\nearthquake, and every vestige of its former existence obliterated, the\r\nspot being now indicated by a frightful desert four leagues distant\r\nfrom the nearest town.\r\n\r\nThe Severn this year was turned from its natural course by a great mass\r\nof land moving from its place across the current near Bildewas Bridge\r\nin Shropshire: this happened on the 27th of May. The year following,\r\na severe earthquake was felt at Altdorf in Switzerland on the 10th of\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1775, on the 8th of September, a severe earthquake shook\r\nWales and its neighbourhood. On the 19th of October, thunderstorms did\r\nmuch damage in the North of England; it was about this time that the\r\nthree Dublin packets foundered at sea: and on the 14th of November, a\r\ntremendous hurricane was experienced on the coast of Holland.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1776, on the 10th of July a shock of an earthquake\r\nwas experienced at Andries in Italy, which overthrew the town, and\r\ndestroyed vast numbers of its inhabitants.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1777, a dreadful hurricane visited St. Petersburgh; it\r\nwas attended by an inundation on the 14th of September, which did much\r\ndamage.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1778, an earthquake did much harm at Smyrna on the 3rd\r\nof July. This same year, after the British army had vacated the city\r\nof Philadelphia, United States, bilious, yellow, or remittent fever\r\nprevailed to a great extent amongst the inhabitants. The plague was\r\nrife at Constantinople; an epidemic angina ravaged Manchester and\r\nvarious other parts of England, and the city of Carthagena in Spain\r\nagain suffered from pestilence, similar to that which was observed\r\nA.D. 1771; it continued, in fact, in an aggravated form, the\r\nfollowing years until 1779, and caused great mortality.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1780, the winter was severe, both in Europe and America.\r\nIn England, on the 14th of January, the mercury fell 26° below zero,\r\nand in Glasgow 46° below the same point. The summer of this year was\r\nvery hot; bilious remittent fevers raged in Philadelphia and in other\r\nparts of the States; a ‘break-bone fever,’ as it was called, also\r\nprevailed extensively, but was not fatal. The thermometer at times\r\nstood at 102°. At this time cholera prevailed in the East Indies, and\r\nis reported to have carried off at Hurdwar, during a festival which\r\nis annually held there, some 20,000 persons, and during the following\r\nyear, 1781, to have assailed, in its most malignant form, a division\r\nof the Bengal troops stationed at Garigani. During the summer of\r\n1780, epidemic pestilence broke out in various parts of Spain: it\r\nfirst made its appearance in a village of Passages in the month of\r\nMay, and continued for some time; it was supposed to have arisen from\r\nintramural burial, the stench from the overcrowded graveyards being\r\nintolerable. The burning heats, this year, may be said to have caused\r\nmuch suffering in several parts of Europe, there having been scarcely\r\nany rain; the summer having been succeeded by a heavy, cloudy winter,\r\npredisposed the inhabitants of various parts of Europe to catarrhal\r\nfevers: pernicious epidemics also prevailed in many parts of Spain; and\r\na malignant fever was rife amongst the inhabitants of Pampeluna: the\r\ncity of Olite was also similarly affected; after a time it extended to\r\nBericayú, Andosella, Mendaira, Toledo, Vidaurreta, and other cities and\r\nplaces. In Pampeluna it persisted for six years, until 1787. A disease\r\ntermed ‘Andalusian fever’ prevailed this year in South America among\r\nthe Spanish colonists, and also at Rio de Janeiro and other Brazilian\r\nsettlements. At Tauris, 15,000 dwellings were demolished, and vast\r\nmultitudes were swallowed up by an earthquake.\r\n\r\nFrom the year 1781 down to 1789, epidemic pestilence committed great\r\nhavoc in various parts of the world. In England, an epizootic was fatal\r\nto horses and horned cattle: of one hundred and sixteen horses located\r\nin one barrack stable, all but thirteen were attacked; seventy-eight\r\ndied. The Channel fleet were great sufferers from epidemic disease;\r\n11,732 sick were sent to Haslar Hospital; 1457 had scurvy; 240\r\ndysentery, and 5539 suffered from severe fever. This may be taken as\r\na specimen of the health of the British navy down to the close of the\r\neighteenth century. Epidemic puerperal fever, about this period, was\r\nvery fatal in London. Measles raged in New York, Philadelphia, and in\r\nother parts of the United States; and numerous cases of hydrophobia\r\noccurred in the more southern States. In the month of July the weather\r\nwas so hot that the thermometer in the shade stood at 103°. In the\r\nstate of Maryland there was great mortality among horses and horned\r\ncattle; and fish at this period died in vast quantities on the coasts\r\nof Lapland and Norway.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1782, in the month of July, there was a dreadful fire\r\nat Constantinople, which destroyed upwards of 7000 houses; and in the\r\nfollowing month, a similar catastrophe caused the destruction of 20,000\r\nmore, many lives being lost: from the consequent crowding together\r\nof the inhabitants, and from other suffering, famine and pestilence\r\nfollowed. The epidemic pestilence which attacked the Bengal troops the\r\nyear previously at Garigani, extended to Sir E. Hughes’ squadron then\r\nstationed in the East, and caused great mortality. The inhabitants\r\nof the provinces of Languedoc and Roussillon were attacked with a\r\nterrific epidemic, which caused great devastation. The governor of\r\nCatalonia, in consequence of the great mortality, sent Dr. Masdevall\r\nto inquire into the character of the epidemic, whether it was, as\r\nit was publicly reported to be, the true plague, and whether it was\r\nor was not contagious. Earthquakes during this year were frequent\r\nin Calabria; they continued from time to time for four years, until\r\nthe end of 1786, producing many fissures, landslips, lakes, ravines,\r\nfalls of the sea-cliffs, and other changes, which taken together\r\nafford one of the finest examples of the complicated alterations which\r\nmay result from a series of subterranean movements, even though of no\r\ngreat apparent violence at the time. During this calamitous period, the\r\ncity of Messina in Sicily was destroyed, and 40,000 persons perished\r\nby an earthquake; the city of Thessalonica suffered from a similarly\r\nsevere shock. A most intense frost commenced this year in England on\r\nChristmas-day; it continued until the end of February in the following\r\nyear. A frightful epidemic broke out in the city of Lerida, which ran\r\nrapidly through the extent of Tarragona, Manresa, Llasanes, Solsona,\r\nIgualada, and Villafranca del Panades; it soon after prevailed over\r\nnearly the whole of Catalonia. Pestilence broke out also in Tortosa and\r\nin several of its districts; it soon extended all over the kingdom of\r\nAragon. This disease was principally variola.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1784, nearly all the districts in the province of\r\nAlcarria, especially Pastrana, suffered from pestilence,--an epidemic\r\ntertian fever, which commenced in the month of November. About this\r\nperiod, there was a great scarcity of water occasioned by the previous\r\nhot and burning weather during a dry summer. The following spring was\r\nrainy and damp, and there broke out exanthematous fevers, rheumatisms,\r\nand intermittent quotidians, throughout all Spain; the small-pox,\r\nwhich had prevailed the year before, and which at first appeared in a\r\nbenign form, soon degenerated, and assumed a malignant character. Dr.\r\nDon Felix Ibañez, a physician of the city of Huete, but long resident\r\nat Pastrana, describes the various diseases of this period in a work\r\nentitled ‘Topographia Hipocratica ó Descripcion de la Epidemia de\r\nCalenturas, tercianas intermittentes, malignas, continuo-remittentes\r\nperniciosas, complicadas que re han padecido en la provincia de la\r\nAlcarria desde el año 1784, hasta 1790, y 1791, y riguentes,’ &c.\r\n\r\nThe following year, 1785, epidemic tertian prevailed in Andalusia.\r\nDr. Don Juan Manuel Alvarez, of Constantina, wrote a work on the\r\npernicious intermittent fevers of this and the previous years, which\r\nhad been so extensively prevalent in the Peninsula: the disease was\r\nfelt more severely in Carthagena than during any other previous year;\r\nit was exceedingly malignant, and destroyed vast numbers. Intemperate\r\nseasons were attended with inundations from rains, so heavy as to form\r\nlakes in some places. The city of Lerida suffered from variola.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1786, in the city del Viso, on the confines of the\r\nprovince of La Mancha, a frightful epidemic broke out, and destroyed\r\ngreat numbers of the inhabitants. The city of St. Roque suffered\r\nin the autumn from a similar pestilence: it proved to be a form of\r\npernicious intermittent. Dr. Don Josef Masdevall’s practice was\r\nadopted in its treatment, and proved as successful as it had hitherto\r\ndone; it consisted of what he termed ‘la opiata antifebril y mixtura\r\nantimonial.’ This year, Brother Miguel de Acero y Aldovera wrote a work\r\non the pernicious effects of intramural interments. The vomito negro\r\nprevailed this year in the Havannah; its outbreak was attributed to the\r\nemanations from putrid hides. In the Madras Reports, it is stated that\r\npestilential cholera was very destructive at Arcot.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1787, there took place on the coast of Coromandel an\r\ninundation proceeding from a severe hurricane; a district called Uppora\r\nwas overflowed by the sea on the 20th of May, when upwards of 12,000\r\npersons lost their lives, and much property in cattle and houses was\r\ndestroyed. There was a violent storm that did much damage in England\r\nand Ireland. There was also an eruption of Vesuvius.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1788, severe frost occurred in England, commencing in\r\nNovember, and continuing till the following March.\r\n\r\nIn the month of October, A.D. 1789, an almost universal\r\ndarkness overspread the land in America, and the most severe\r\npestilences on record occurred all over the United States, in the form\r\nof anginas, croup, ulcerated sore-throat, putrid bilious fevers, &c.\r\nDr. Manson describes one of the epidemics thus; “slight influenza,\r\nstinging pain in the jaws and limbs, soreness of the muscles of the\r\nneck, attended with severe fever.” The measles, which occurred the year\r\npreviously, appear to have been the prelude to a series of epidemics\r\nwhich raged for thirty years. Influenza was very severe in the cities\r\nof New York and Philadelphia, and rapidly affected the other parts of\r\nthe States, wherever the same conditions of weather and atmosphere\r\nprevailed: this disease also traversed the barren wilderness, seizing\r\non the Indian population, attacked seamen at sea, and raged with great\r\nmortality through the western hemisphere, from the 15° to 45° of\r\nnorthern latitude. Scarlet fever was also prevalent at Philadelphia,\r\nand carried off great numbers of the young. These epidemics generally\r\nexhibited as the predominant feature the superabundance of biliary\r\nsecretions, which were vomited.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1790, the winter was very mild in America, there having\r\nbeen but little frost until the month of February. In spring, catarrhs\r\nprevailed; plethoric and consumptive persons suffered most, and were\r\nthe principal victims: measles appeared in autumn. The year following,\r\n1791, the winter commenced early, and was very severe; the spring and\r\nsummer were dry and cold: catarrhs again prevailed: yellow fever broke\r\nout in New York, and carried off numbers: scarlatina and hooping-cough\r\nwere also rife. About this period a kind of black worm, resembling a\r\ncaterpillar, appeared in Maryland, and destroyed the grass and corn;\r\nthey were represented as appearing in legions. At the same time a\r\nblight destroyed the fruit and other vegetable productions; and another\r\ndistinct species of worm, called the palmer-worm, answering to the\r\ndescription given in Sacred History, infested the land, devouring even\r\nthe forest trees, and destroying all woodwork. The thermometer at\r\nSalem rose to 80° for fifty days, and for twelve days stood at 90°:\r\nin various other parts of the States it varied from 90° to 102°. The\r\nbilious plague, as reported by Dr. Rush, prevailed at Philadelphia.\r\nThe island of Grenada in the West Indies suffered from a similar\r\npestilence. Bilious remittent fever was also prevalent on the coast\r\nof Africa: the plague raged in Egypt, and typhus fever committed great\r\nravages in England: yellow pestilence laid waste the Havannah; and a\r\nsevere murrain afflicted the horned cattle in Hungary, Servia, and\r\nother European countries.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1791, a tremendous earthquake was felt in Sicily, which\r\ndestroyed many lives and much property; it was equal in severity to\r\nthe shock experienced the year before at Borgo di San Sepolcro, during\r\nwhich an opening in the earth swallowed up many houses with their\r\ninhabitants. On the 2nd of February, this year, the Thames rose to an\r\nextreme height, and overflowed many parts of Westminster.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1792. This was a pestilential year in Egypt; it is\r\nrecorded that 800,000 persons died from plague. The winter of the\r\nprevious year, 1791, was very severe, and the spring wet and rainy\r\nin the southern parts of the United States; the summer was cold up\r\nto June, cold north-west winds prevailing. In May and June, locusts\r\nappeared in the State of New York, and devoured the grain; the wheat\r\ninsect continued its ravages with great destruction to the crops in\r\nLong Island and also in Maryland and north of the Elk ridge. In the\r\nmonth of July, yellow fever raged terribly, causing great mortality in\r\nthe city of Charleston. A kind of caterpillar destroyed the lime-trees\r\nin Philadelphia, and in the month of August, scarlet fever carried off\r\nnumbers in that city, as well as in New York, and in a place called\r\nBethlem.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1793, the spring was dry, the summer intensely hot and\r\nshowery, with hail, and the autumn dry and cold. A fatal dysentery\r\nswept off vast numbers in Georgetown, Coventry; a nervous fever was\r\nprevalent at a place called Fairfield. Yellow fever raged to an\r\nalarming extent in Philadelphia, carrying off in the course of four\r\nor five months upwards of 4000 persons: it was also fatal in Boston.\r\nIn the following year it prevailed in Baltimore, and at Norfolk in\r\nVirginia. About this period a similar epidemic caused great destruction\r\nin the island of Dominica and other of the West Indian islands: in\r\nDominica it continued for three years, until 1796.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1794, an awful earthquake was felt at Naples, and\r\nVesuvius, pouring forth its flames, overwhelmed the city of Torre del\r\nGreco. The following year, the weather was uncommonly bad, the spring\r\ncold and late, the summer suffocatingly hot, damp, and rainy, whilst\r\nsouth winds were prevalent,--the fruits perished from mould. There was\r\na disease among vegetables, especially the potatoes and cabbages. A\r\ndense moisture penetrated into the inmost recesses of the houses, even\r\ninto desks, bureaux, &c., and the walls appeared covered with a damp\r\nwhite mould, which destroyed the paper-hangings. Millions of mosquitoes\r\nand other insects were generated; in fact, a pestilential constitution\r\nof the air, answering to the description given by Hippocrates and\r\nother writers, was evidenced by these signs. Yellow fever raged with\r\ngreat violence in many parts of the United States of America, viz. in\r\nPhiladelphia, New York, Charleston, &c., and continued until 1800. “In\r\nthe whole course of my life,” says Professor Kemp, writing to Dr. Baily\r\non yellow fever, “I never experienced a state of air so distressingly\r\ndebilitating, and unfriendly to my spirits.” On the 6th of February,\r\nthis year, a severe shock of an earthquake was felt at Vienna. At this\r\nperiod 10,000 persons lost their lives in three towns of Turkey by a\r\nsimilar catastrophe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n                        FROM A.D. 1795 TO 1848.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1795, a severe earthquake was felt on the 17th of\r\nJuly at Manchester and in its neighbourhood: there was a second\r\nshock afterwards on the 18th of October. On the 6th of November,\r\nin the same year, a violent storm destroyed many lives and much\r\nproperty in England. On the 24th of the following month, December,\r\na severe frost set in, and continued until the 23rd of January.\r\nMurrain committed great ravages in Lombardy amongst horned cattle.\r\nProfessor Count Moscati and Drs. Deho, Bonvicini, and Gherardini\r\npublished a description of its symptoms, amongst which were observable\r\ngreat rigidity and tension in the necks of animals, and also great\r\nsensibility along the spinal column, towards the termination of the\r\nmalady. Two years after, 1797, a similar epidemic prevailed in the\r\nVenetian States, especially in Friuli: horses, sheep, and poultry\r\nsuffered from this malady, as well as horned cattle. A severe\r\nearthquake, this year, 1796, destroyed the whole country between Santa\r\nFé and Panama, including the cities of Cusco and Quito; 40,000 of the\r\ninhabitants were in one second hurled into eternity. The seasons were\r\nintemperate in the United States. Bilious remittent or yellow fever\r\nprevailed at New York, Charleston, Boston, Newburyport, Philadelphia,\r\nand in various others of the States. The year following, 1797, the\r\nepidemic continued to cause great mortality in the States, especially\r\nin Norfolk, Providence, Portland, and Savannah, and it extended thence\r\nto New Orleans: it commenced with the symptoms of common remittent\r\nfever, and increased progressively in violence, carrying off numbers of\r\nthe inhabitants.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1798. The preceding winter was severe and long. The\r\nsummer, this year, was remarkably dry and sultry; the rivers afterwards\r\ninundated the adjoining country, heavy rains falling at the same\r\ntime. Catarrhs, pleurisies, and sore throats prevailed, with bilious\r\nfevers. In the autumn, grasshoppers infested the country round about\r\nPennsylvania and New England, and a pestilential fever commenced and\r\nspread dismay among the inhabitants: many were carried off by it.\r\nThe citizens of New York, Philadelphia, Wilmington, Newport, Albany,\r\nBoston, Portsmouth, and New London, suffered greatly from this disease,\r\nwhich exhibited both bubo and carbuncle, with many other symptoms of\r\nthe true plague. A peculiar fog or vapour was observed in New York\r\nduring the most fatal period of this pestilence, especially in the\r\nmonth of September. Lake and marsh fevers prevailed also about this\r\nperiod in the low and swampy districts, such as Milford, &c. This\r\nyellow pestilence was less generally characterized by inflammatory\r\naction, and venesection was attended with less salutary effects than on\r\nformer occasions.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1799. In Barbary, 3000 died daily from severe pestilence:\r\nat Fez alone, 247,000 persons are said to have perished in consequence.\r\nIn Morocco, pestilence was preceded by famine, induced by extreme\r\nelemental disturbance. At Mogador it broke out, in April, in the form\r\nof virulent small-pox; by July it had assumed the type of the most\r\ndeadly species of plague: this fatal disease ceased in October, after\r\ncarrying off numbers. At a small village called Diabet, situated about\r\ntwo miles south-east of Mogador, it raged with great violence for\r\ntwenty-one days, carrying off during that period one hundred persons\r\nout of one hundred and thirty. Many populous villages, in the extensive\r\nShellah province of Haha, suffered in a similar manner. The birds\r\ndeserted their former abodes during the prevalence of this pestilence.\r\nThe Emperor, it is reported, had the plague twice during the time.\r\n\r\nThe summer in the United States of America, this year, 1799, was sultry\r\nand dry, with much thunder and lightning, succeeded by deluging rains;\r\nthe autumn was variable, and the winter severe; the following spring\r\nwas cold and late, and yellow fever showed itself to a certain extent\r\nin many of the States.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1800, malignant yellow fever commenced at Baltimore,\r\nand raged in Boston, and in various other of the principal districts\r\nof the Union. In the autumn of this year, Cadiz became desolate from\r\na similar pestilence; by the middle of September the deaths amounted\r\nto 200 daily: at this period the air, from its stagnant state, says\r\nArejula, became so vitiated, that its noxious qualities affected even\r\nthe lower orders of animals: canary birds died with blood issuing\r\nfrom their bills; and in none of the neighbouring towns, which were\r\nafterwards infected, did any sparrows appear during the epidemic. We\r\nsaw, continues Arejula, many of the domestic animals die with some\r\nof the same symptoms as those presented by persons labouring under\r\nthe disease. Dogs were affected by the epidemic more than any other\r\nanimals; the cats next, and the horses, then poultry and canary birds;\r\ndogs and cats were also subject to hemorrhages, but more so to the\r\nblack vomit, and to dark fœtid evacuations. The horses which I saw die,\r\nhe says, had that marble coldness of the extremities, or the general\r\nconvulsions, so remarkable in this disease. Another author, Fellows,\r\nstates that all the physicians in Cadiz and in Malaga who have written\r\non this disorder, and with whom he had conversed, confirmed to him\r\nthe facts as detailed by Arejula. The inhabitants of Xeres suffered\r\ngreatly from this yellow pestilence; it also prevailed at Malaga, and\r\nin various other parts of Spain: it persisted unto 1804.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1801, anginas, pleurisies, and yellow pestilence\r\ncontinued to prevail for several years in the United States of America,\r\nand in other places: typhus was rife in Ireland and England, especially\r\nin London, from which city and countries it is scarcely ever absent.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1802, a very hot and dry summer was succeeded in November\r\nby incessant heavy rain: thick fogs spread over the country, and\r\nenveloped such places in central Germany as were inaccessible to\r\nventilation; amongst others, the small Franconian town of Roettingen,\r\nsituated on the river Tauber, and surrounded by mountains. Towards\r\nthe end of the month an extremely fatal disease broke out, which\r\nwas without example in the memory of its oldest inhabitants, it\r\nbeing totally unknown to them previously. The young and strong were\r\nsuddenly seized with pain and anguish at the heart, with violent\r\npalpitations, and lacerating pains in the nape of the neck; profuse,\r\nsour, ill-smelling perspiration broke out over the entire body, and\r\na suffering, as though a violent rheumatic fever had seized on the\r\ntendinous expansions, accompanied this terrible malady: in the worst\r\ncases a spasmodic trembling ensued, the patient fainted, the limbs\r\nbecame rigid, and death closed the scene, frequently within twenty-four\r\nhours from the commencement of the attack.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1803. Influenza overspread the British Isles in the\r\nspring of this year, causing great mortality: in severity it was\r\nsimilar to those prevalent A.D. 1762 and 1782, as described by\r\nSir George Baker.\r\n\r\nTommasini describes a yellow pestilence which raged at Leghorn and at\r\nLucca A.D. 1804. A similar disease was also prevalent in the\r\nWest Indian Islands about this period, especially in the islands of\r\nMartinique and Grenada. The year following, 1805, spotted typhus, or\r\npetechial pestilence, was rife in various parts of the United States,\r\nand caused great mortality.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1809, epidemic pestilence suddenly made its appearance\r\namongst the British troops occupying Portugal.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1810, in the month of October, yellow pestilence appeared\r\nat Gibraltar: of the population of this fortress, amounting to 14,000,\r\nonly twenty-eight escaped the malady; twelve of these had had the\r\ndisease previously in the West Indies and elsewhere. A.D.\r\n1811, puerperal fever was prevalent and lethal in Somersetshire.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1812, Constantinople suffered dreadfully from plague,\r\nwhich carried off 160,000 persons. Since the severe winter of 1794–95,\r\nthis country (England) had not experienced such an intense and\r\ncontinued cold as occurred during the present season, from the 30th of\r\nNovember, 1813, to February, 1814. The early part of December was raw,\r\nchilly, and occasionally foggy; frost, which was severe, commenced the\r\nday after Christmas-day: on the 27th it was accompanied by a thick fog,\r\nwhich, towards noon, became so dense as to render all objects invisible\r\nat a short distance, even with the aid of torches, so as to prevent the\r\ndeparture of mail-coaches and of other carriages; numerous accidents\r\noccurred in and near London. This singular and dark state of the\r\natmosphere, which was extremely offensive both to the eyes and lungs,\r\ncontinued for the space of seven days, with scarcely any change, even\r\nat noon, except the appearance of a dim light during the latter; and\r\nas the frost increased, the houses, shrubs, and trees became thickly\r\ncovered with the freezing humidity of the fog. This state of things\r\nterminated at the end of the week with a heavy fall of snow, which\r\ncontinued until the streets were covered to the depth of several feet,\r\nto the great interruption of all communication with the country for\r\nseveral days. In the last week of January, from a partial thaw, immense\r\nmasses of ice were brought down the Thames, which, on the recurrence of\r\nfrost, became so united as to be capable of supporting the weight of\r\ngreat multitudes of people, who were entertained in the booths erected\r\nupon the ice during the fair near Blackfriars Bridge. The wind blew\r\nalmost invariably from the east and north-east, and was frequently very\r\nhigh, rendering the cold more intense: on many days the temperature was\r\nas low as 15° of Fahrenheit, and it was said to have fallen on some\r\nnights as low as 11°, and even lower. The effects of this severity of\r\nthe cold were aggravated amongst the lower orders by the difficulty of\r\nprocuring fuel, in consequence of the great scarcity of coals, which\r\ncost double the usual price. Persons of all ages suffered from severe\r\ninfluenza, attended with fever of a rather malignant type: children,\r\nand persons who had passed the middle period, as usual, suffered the\r\nmost, from their vital powers being less energetic than during the\r\nintermediate periods of existence. During the months of October and\r\nNovember (1813) typhus fever became more frequent than it had been for\r\nseveral years previously: it prevailed mostly in the filthy courts\r\nof Saffron Hill, near Hatton Garden, which are almost exclusively\r\ninhabited by the lowest kind of Irish labourers. Scarlatina was also\r\nrife, but was not very fatal. These diseases were not, however,\r\nconfined to the places where they first appeared; they soon showed\r\nthemselves in the crowded districts in the eastern and north-eastern\r\nparts of the town, and in the Borough, and were greatly prevalent in\r\nthe alleys about Essex Street, in Whitechapel, near Golden Lane, Old\r\nStreet, and in many filthy courts about Cow Cross and Chick Lane,\r\nin the vicinity of Smithfield: they were also rife in the districts\r\nnear Kent Street, in the parishes of St. George and St. Saviour, in\r\nSouthwark, in the courts running into Shoe Lane, Clare Market, the\r\nStrand, at Somers Town, and, singular to say, they broke out last of\r\nall in St. Giles’, the district proverbially the receptacle of beggary\r\nand vice.\r\n\r\nDuring this year (1813), yellow pestilence again made its appearance\r\nat Gibraltar; it raged from October till the month of December, when\r\nit subsided, after causing great destruction of the troops then in\r\ngarrison. The civilians suffered an equal mortality. In the year\r\nfollowing (1814), this epidemic again broke out in the month of August,\r\nand disappeared about the end of October; it was not again heard of on\r\nthe rock until 1828.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1813, plague made its appearance in the island of Malta,\r\nwhere it had not been known previously for 138 years,--not since the\r\nyear 1675. From the month of April to that of November, 4483 persons\r\nwere carried off by it; it also raged at Gozzo, Corfu, &c.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1815, the harvest was unfavourable all over Europe, and\r\nseveral provinces of Naples were threatened with famine. On the 27th\r\nof December, a suspicious epidemic broke out at Noya: it consisted of\r\na hot nervous fever, rapidly running its course, with gangrenous and\r\nmalignant boils and carbuncles; women were the first and most frequent\r\nvictims; children also suffered in a similar proportion; old persons\r\nwere more exempt. The disease soon afterwards appeared at Cagliari,\r\nand it is stated not to have presented any of the characteristics of\r\nthe plague, although it was very fatal. This pestilence was preceded\r\nby a famine, which commenced among the poor: other diseases prevailed\r\nat the same time: the prevalence of a south wind seemed to increase\r\nits propagative powers; it continued about six months, when it ceased\r\nsuddenly in the following year, 1816.\r\n\r\nAbout this period, A.D. 1815, pestilential disease was\r\ndeveloped in the island of Corfu; it first made its appearance at\r\na little village called Marathea, in the district of Lefchimo.\r\nTully states that nothing could equal the wretched appearance of\r\nthe village,--poverty, with all its miserable train of attendants,\r\npresenting itself to view at every step. Near this village stagnant\r\npools and marshes everywhere presented themselves: rains set in earlier\r\nthan usual, and were followed by a long drought and heat, unnatural for\r\nthe advanced season of the year, with a constant sirocco or south-east\r\nwind: so rapidly fatal was this pestilence, that more than a fourth\r\npart of the inhabitants were carried off in a few days. It is recorded\r\nthat out of 700 seized in this small village, only 78 recovered!\r\n\r\nDuring the same year, the fall of rain in the East was remarkable,\r\nespecially during the rainy season, when it was indeed excessive,--and\r\nthat which rendered it the more worthy of notice was, that the Ganges,\r\nthe Soane, and the Coossee rivers burst their boundaries, and destroyed\r\na vast extent of agricultural property in the neighbouring districts.\r\nThe cold season that followed was also damp, and not bracing; and again\r\nthe hot or summer season that followed was also moist. The winter\r\nwhich followed was unfortunately also damp, and the atmosphere during\r\nthe subsequent summer, A.D. 1816, was exceedingly loaded\r\nwith moisture in the shape of dense fogs; drought followed, for the\r\nheat was intense; few north-westers, it is said, occurred to temper\r\nthe air, and those which did were accompanied with little or no rain:\r\ntowards the end of the month of May, the thermometer had risen to\r\n98° in the shade,--a very uncommon height in Bengal. This scorching,\r\nburning weather continued uninterrupted unto the middle of June. In\r\nthe remaining portion of June and in July the rains fell moderately\r\nin Calcutta and in its vicinity; but in the month following, August,\r\nthe showers became scanty and rare, while the days and nights were\r\noppressively hot. In the western part of the provinces the great\r\ndrought which succeeded dried up the rivers, so that apprehensions\r\nwere entertained for the safety of the rice cultivation. The 1st of\r\nSeptember ushered in a most unexpected change: rain came down in\r\ndeluges, and continued unabated during the entire month: it caused a\r\ngreater and more extensive inundation than had happened within the\r\nrecollection of the oldest inhabitant.\r\n\r\nThe morbid effects of a long train of anomalous weather then became\r\nevident amongst the people. Low fevers of a typhoid character\r\nprevailed, accompanied by a malignant sore-throat,--a disease\r\npreviously unknown there, according to the Bengal Report.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1817 was the commencement of a pestilential period,\r\nduring which disease raged rampant all over the habitable globe, and so\r\ncontinued for a series of years: yellow pestilence prevailed with great\r\nviolence, and caused great mortality at Savannah, New Orleans, Mobile,\r\nNatchez, the Havannah, Baltimore, Charleston, and elsewhere in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nPestilential cholera commenced and committed great ravages, especially\r\nin India, where it prevailed with an intensity and fatality equal to\r\nthose of a similar malady which was fatal to thousands of the human\r\nrace A.D. 260. This pestilence broke out in the month of\r\nAugust, it is said, at a place called Jessore, a populous town in the\r\ncentre of the Delta of the Ganges, the capital of the Sunderbunds,\r\ndistant from Calcutta about sixty English miles, and there it caused\r\ngreat mortality, proving fatal to almost all on whom it seized.\r\nJessore is described as being a crowded, filthy place, surrounded by\r\nimpenetrable and marshy jungles, and consequently exposed to all the\r\nhorrors of a malarious and ill-ventilated atmosphere. In the course\r\nof a few weeks, 10,000 of the inhabitants perished in this district\r\nonly. In the September following, it broke out in Calcutta, where it\r\ncommitted great ravages. It spread thence along the banks of the Ganges\r\nin a north-westerly direction, not then extending further to the east\r\nthan Muzufferpore. It also attacked with great violence the English\r\narmy assembled in Bundelcund, under the Marquess of Hastings, on the\r\nbanks of the Sinde, in the most central part of India. Five thousand\r\nmen perished between the 15th and 20th of November, 9000 of the troops\r\ndying altogether during this attack of the epidemic. The roads were\r\ncovered with the dying and the dead.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1818. This dreadful epidemic extended to Jaulnah, on the\r\nMadras side of the Indian peninsula, and in August of the same year\r\nit reached Bombay; in fact, it may be said to have extended itself to\r\nevery part of India, and to many of the neighbouring countries, which\r\nare to this day suffering from it, but in a mitigated degree. In March,\r\n10,000 perished from it in Banda and its environs. Hutta, Saugur,\r\nOugein, and Kotah also suffered in a similar proportion. An equal\r\nnumber died of cholera in the same month in Allahabad. In April and\r\nMay, Cawnpore, Meerhut, Agra, and Delhi were attacked, and the disease\r\nraged in these towns with great severity. About the same time, Lucknow\r\nand Fyzabad, cities in Oude, were ravaged by it, and 30,000 perished in\r\nGoruckpore alone. In October, the disease broke out in Madras, and in\r\nCeylon in the following December. During this period, it proved very\r\ndestructive to the inhabitants of the Mauritius, raged violently in\r\nthe Burmese Empire, in the kingdom of Aracan, and in the peninsula of\r\nMolucca. Yellow pestilence also raged at the same time in the United\r\nStates, and continued the two following years, 1819 and 1820, carrying\r\noff great numbers in many of the States, especially in New York and\r\nPhiladelphia; it was also rife in the West Indian Islands, in Bermuda,\r\nin British Guiana, and in various parts of the South American continent.\r\n\r\nThe year 1819 was marked by great commotions of the elements, and\r\na general spread of epidemic pestilence all over the world; its\r\nprevalence was remarked in all the four quarters of the globe, each\r\nportion having been visited by the forms of disease peculiar to its\r\nseveral climates. A tract of country, the Ullah-Bund, in the Delta\r\nof the Indus, extending nearly fifty miles in length and sixteen\r\nin breadth, was upheaved ten feet; while adjoining districts were\r\ndepressed, and the features of the Delta completely altered. The island\r\nof Penang, Sumatra, Singapore, the kingdom of Siam, and the isles of\r\nFrance and Bourbon were infected with pestilential cholera. In the\r\nsingle town of Bankok, the capital of Siam, 40,000 persons perished by\r\nthis dire destruction.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1820 cholera extended to Tonquin, Cambogia,\r\nCochin-China, Southern China, Canton, the Philippines, &c.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1821, Xeres was visited by yellow pestilence; the British\r\ntroops suffered severely, and the civilians in greater proportion;\r\nit prevailed also with great destruction at Cadiz, a city which\r\nhad suffered between the years 1800 and 1821, from eleven epidemic\r\npestilences of a similar type. (_Vide_ Professor Salva, of\r\nBarcelona, on Yellow Fever.)--Sir James Fellows, in his reports on\r\nthe pestilential disorders of Andalusia during these years, asserts,\r\nas before remarked, that the air from its stagnant state became so\r\nvitiated that its noxious qualities affected even dumb animals. The\r\nwinter in America this year was mild until the end of December; the\r\nspring was wet and cold, and the summer dry and sultry, with uncommon\r\nheat; all vegetable productions seemed to wither, and the drought was\r\nso great that the wells or springs were dried up; the thermometer rose\r\nto 90° and 100° in May; and intermittent, remittent and bilious fevers,\r\nwith dysenteries, prevailed in the swampy districts. In the month of\r\nAugust, yellow pestilence made its appearance at New York, and was soon\r\nrife at Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and at Charleston; it was also\r\nprevalent at New Orleans, Natchez, Mobile, Alabama, and the Havannah,\r\nand extended along the low banks of the Mississippi river. From this\r\nperiod until 1822, the disease, although diminished in severity, yet\r\ncarried off great numbers in the various districts.\r\n\r\nDestructive cholera, which may be said not to have subsided at all,\r\nvisited, this year, 1821, the island of Java, Bantam, Mendura,\r\nBorneo, and various other parts in the Indian Archipelago. In Java\r\nit is reported that 102,000 persons were carried off by it, 17,000\r\nof whom belonged to the town of Batavia, one of the most unhealthy\r\ntowns in the East. This same year, this dreadful pestilence, in the\r\nmonth of July, reached Muscat in Arabia, in its western course, where\r\n10,000 persons lost their lives, and during the remainder of the year\r\ncommitted great ravages in various places in the Persian Gulf. In the\r\nfollowing month, August, it appeared in Persia, and raged with violence\r\nat Bassora and at Baghdad. In Bassora, 18,000 lives, being one-third\r\nof the population, were sacrificed in eleven days, and a similarly\r\nfearful destruction befel Baghdad. In Bushire, where it broke out in\r\nJuly, 1821, its ravages were most fearful. The bazaars were closed, the\r\nhouses abandoned, the unburied dead lay in heaps in the streets, and\r\nthe surviving population sought safety in flight. In Shiraz one-eighth\r\nof the population perished.\r\n\r\nIn the years 1822–24, it revisited Tonquin and also Pekin, Central\r\nand Northern China, the Moluccas or Spice Islands, Amboyna, Macassar,\r\nAssam, and most of the other eastern countries. In Ispahan the epidemic\r\ndid not inflict much damage, but at Erzeroom it attacked the army of\r\nthe victorious Abbas Mirza, and swept his ranks from front to rear,\r\nthe terror-stricken soldiery throwing away their arms, and flying from\r\nbefore the invisible destroyer. During these years, 1822–24, extending\r\nto 1827–29–30, this pestilence prevailed in many of the principal\r\ncities of Persia, and also in Chinese Tartary: it ravaged most of the\r\npopulous cities of Mesopotamia, Syria, and Judæa, and reached within\r\n150 miles of the Georgian frontiers of Russia: it was also rife at\r\nOrenburg and Astrachan, beyond which it seems not to have extended\r\nuntil the years 1828–29, when it appeared at Orenburg, the capital of\r\nthe province of that name, situated on the Tartar frontier, 400 miles\r\nnorth of the Caspian Sea. During this period, disease was rife in\r\nvarious other parts of the world.\r\n\r\nThere was a great scarcity, A.D. 1822, and epidemic typhus\r\nprevailed to a great extent in the west of Ireland, involving other\r\nparts of that unfortunate country. An awful earthquake occurred about\r\nthis period at Chili, by which an immense tract of ground, 1000 square\r\nmiles, was elevated from two to six feet above its original level, and\r\na great part of the bottom of the sea remained bare and dry at high\r\nwater, with beds of oysters, mussels, and other shellfish adhering to\r\nthe rocks on which they grew. The fish being all dead, and exhaling\r\nmost offensive effluvia, disease consequently ensued. Ordinary typhus\r\nprevailed in Paris, during which time many cases of spasmodic yellow\r\nfever, as it was termed, were observed.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1823, the Laplanders are stated to have suffered greatly\r\nin their cattle from murrain; upwards of 5000 head were carried\r\noff,--wolves even being destroyed by it, so intense and general\r\namong the lower animals was the distemper. Yellow fever this year\r\nprevailed in Lisbon and in the Island of Ascension, and also in various\r\nsettlements on the African coast, especially at Sierra Leone. The\r\ntwo years following, 1824–25, pestilence was rife in Lisbon. Yellow\r\npestilence, in the latter year, devastated many places on the coast of\r\nSouth America, especially in the Brazils. Yellow fever prevailed at\r\nRio de Janeiro. The drought was excessive, but was succeeded by heavy\r\nrains, common in this quarter of the globe. At one settlement alone,\r\nAracaty, the mortality in a short time was estimated at 30,000. Great\r\nnumbers died during their efforts to reach the coast for water; wild\r\nas well as domestic animals perished. The drought, with its attendant\r\nmisery and deadliness, was so great, that to this day the inhabitants\r\nspeak of the calamity with horror. About this period, small-pox\r\ncommitted great ravages in Hamburgh; and at Grand Cairo 30,000 persons\r\ndied of pestilence.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1826, epidemic typhus prevailed all over Ireland, and\r\ncaused great mortality. Dr. Graves, in his Lectures, refers to very\r\nmany well-marked cases of yellow fever. He says, “We have had this year\r\nnumerous cases which in their symptoms and their morbid anatomy agree\r\nessentially with yellow fever,--yellow skin, black vomit, &c.”\r\n\r\nA.D. 1827. In the early part of this year, Groningen,\r\nFriesland, North Holland, Belgium, and Lower Germany suffered from\r\nepidemic influenza. The previous summer (1826) was followed by moist\r\nweather, and the countries were damp from inundations. The epidemic\r\nraged with such mortality, that the Dutch Government found it necessary\r\nto adopt strong measures to relieve the sickness which affected nearly\r\nthe whole population.\r\n\r\nYellow fever was prevalent in the United States; remittent fever\r\nwas also rife in various parts of England; the symptoms amounted in\r\nseverity to those of pestilence, and were such as had scarcely been\r\nseen in England since the days of Sydenham.\r\n\r\nThis year, a singular malady--a sort of rheumatic fever, occasioning\r\ngreat agony,--broke out in the island of St. Thomas, in the West\r\nIndies, and affected almost every one of a population amounting to\r\n12,000 persons. It obtained from the negroes the cognomen of ‘dandy\r\nfever.’ It proved to be an exceedingly painful disease, crippling\r\npersons for weeks and months, and obliging them to move about on\r\ncrutches; it was, however, rarely fatal: it spread generally all\r\nover the West Indian Islands. A similar disease prevailed the year\r\nfollowing, A.D. 1828, in Paris, and was considered by the\r\nParisians as being of an extraordinary character. A writer thus\r\ndescribes the malady:--It was generally unaccompanied with any great\r\ndegree of fever, but affected the whole nervous system in a most\r\npeculiar manner; especially by a most painful sense of formication\r\nin the hands and feet, as well as a degree of numbness which seized\r\nfirst upon the members, and thence extended over the whole body.\r\nThe formication and painful numbness of the extremities were so\r\ncharacteristic of the complaint, that at Paris and elsewhere in France\r\nit was known by the name of ‘mal des pieds et des mains.’\r\n\r\nThe cellular tissue, in this disease, became affected after a while;\r\nthe hands and feet swelled, and œdema attacked the face and several\r\nother parts of the frame: immense numbers suffered from it in France.\r\nThe sensations were compared to those caused by the punctures from\r\nthe points of a thousand needles, or of some such sharp instrument;\r\nan intense degree of heat aggravated the sufferings, and many could\r\nscarcely move their body or extremities without great agony; cramps and\r\nspasmodic contractions were present in many cases; the digestive organs\r\nwere greatly disordered, and symptoms of cholera morbus were sometimes\r\ndeveloped in the course of the disease; eruptions of various kinds\r\noccurred on the body; sleep was prevented by excessive pain and general\r\ndisturbance of the system; delirium sometimes supervened; the sight\r\nand hearing, and the sense of smell, were altogether lost in some, but\r\nin others only partially impaired. In some, convalescence followed in\r\na few weeks; in others, not until several months had elapsed. Great\r\nnumbers fell victims to the malady, and many perished ultimately from\r\nits sequelæ.\r\n\r\nThis year, A.D. 1828, Gibraltar was again visited by yellow\r\npestilence, which attacked both the military and civilians; it\r\ncommenced in the month of September; it broke out among, and was\r\nfor some time confined to, the filthiest and most crowded parts, or\r\ndistricts, on the rock, but it ultimately seized on all ranks and\r\nclasses of society. It was observed to prevail to a greater extent and\r\nmore severely in some situations than in others, particularly along\r\nthe line of wall facing the sea,--few of the soldiers stationed there\r\nescaping an attack, so that it was soon found necessary to withdraw\r\nthe sentries stationed in the neighbourhood. From this period to 1834,\r\nthere was great famine in Italy; the seasons were moist and hot;\r\nrepeated inundations occurred there, and south winds and summer fogs\r\nprevailed. The French army encamped before the city of Naples lost\r\ngreat numbers by pestilence. A disease called ‘la trousse galante’\r\ncarried off immense numbers in France. There were during this period\r\ngreat failures of the crops in England and elsewhere in Europe,\r\noccasioned by wet and mild winters, followed by hot summers: epidemic\r\npestilence was the consequence.\r\n\r\nThe breaking out of epidemic pestilence in Orenburg, in August, A.D.\r\n1829, was attended with some extraordinary phenomena,--the atmosphere\r\nwas suddenly filled with dense masses of small green flies, which\r\nin Asia are looked upon as the forerunners of pestilence, and are\r\ntherefore called plague-flies; the streets swarmed with these insects,\r\nand on quitting their houses, the inhabitants were literally covered\r\nfrom head to foot with them.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1830. A blight or disease, this year, made its appearance\r\nin the potato and other crops in various parts of Germany, in Ireland,\r\nand in America. In 1832, it was more general and severe in some\r\nsituations than in others.\r\n\r\nCholera about this period showed itself on the borders of the Black\r\nSea, penetrating thence into the centre of European Russia, where it\r\ncontinued throughout the winter. Towards the beginning of autumn, it\r\ncommenced with great violence in the Georgian frontier of Persia,\r\nhaving appeared in June, 1830, in the Persian province of Ghilan,\r\non the Caspian shore; from the southern parts of which it extended\r\nnorthward, along the west Caspian shore, until it reached Baku, Tiflis,\r\nAstrachan, and numerous other places, in its progress into the very\r\nheart of the Russian empire. At Astrachan, from July to the end of\r\nAugust, 4000 died in the city, and 21,270 in the entire province. 2367\r\npersons died of it in Saratov; and shortly afterwards, of 1792 Don\r\nCossacks attacked, 1334 perished. At Penza, situate about 140 miles\r\nnorth of Saratov, 1200 of the population were seized in the course of\r\na fortnight, and 800 sunk under it. At Nischnei Novgorod, where the\r\nepidemic soon afterwards broke out, 1863 persons were taken ill, of\r\nwhom nearly a thousand died. The mortality in Bessarabia and Moldavia\r\nwas appalling: Jassi, the capital of Moldavia, was almost depopulated.\r\nThis insatiable malady continued to spread, carrying death in its\r\ncourse westward and northward, through Russia, Poland, Moldavia, the\r\nduchy of Posen, Silesia, and Austria, visiting Warsaw, with other towns\r\nin Poland, and extending, May, 1831, to Riga and Dantzic; and in June\r\nand July to St. Petersburgh and Cronstadt: it reached Berlin on the\r\nlast day of August, Vienna in September, and Hamburgh on the 7th of\r\nOctober.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1831, cholera followed the Russian army employed in\r\nthe subjugation of Poland; it also proved very destructive in Warsaw\r\nand in many other places during the months of April and May. In June\r\nit prevailed in Cracow and other adjoining places, extending in its\r\ncourse to Gallicia, Hungary, Smyrna, and Constantinople; it raged with\r\nsuch intensity at Cairo, that 10,400 Mahomedans, besides Jews and\r\nChristians, were carried off. During this year, whilst cholera was\r\nprogressing over the continent of Europe, it appeared at Mecca, where\r\nit proved very destructive to the ‘Hadji,’ or pilgrims. In August, it\r\nbroke out at Alexandria, and nearly at the same time all the towns in\r\nthe Delta of the Nile suffered from its violence. This year, when the\r\npestilence was at its height at Baghdad, the population of the city was\r\ncomputed to be 80,000; of this number, 7000 perished during the first\r\nfortnight: the epidemic continued to increase in severity, until the\r\nmaximum rate of mortality for some days was 5000 daily: 50,000 are\r\nsupposed to have been carried off in this devoted city during the two\r\nmonths it was devastated by this awful pestilence. In destructiveness\r\nit was equal to any former visitation on record; it was, however, to be\r\nattributed, not so much to the effects of pestilential miasmata, as to\r\nconcurring circumstances which obliged the inhabitants to congregate\r\ndensely in particular parts of the city. The rivers Euphrates and\r\nTigris are flooded twice in the year, first in the spring, from the\r\nmelting of the snow in the mountains of Armenia, and afterwards in\r\nthe autumn, from the periodical rains. The country round about was\r\ninundated, this year, to an uncommon degree, beyond any traditional\r\nexample,--the lower part of the country particularly. At Baghdad the\r\nwaters were for a time kept from bursting into the town by means of\r\nthe walls, but on the night of the 26th of April a part thereof on\r\nthe north-west side of the city was undermined, and fell. The waters\r\nimmediately rushed in and caused the destruction of about 7000 houses,\r\nburying 15,000 persons in the ruins: many of these were lying sick\r\nof the pestilence; and there was besides a large number of unburied\r\ndead. In consequence of the daily fall or partial ruin of houses from\r\nthe encroachments of the waters before their subsidence occurred, the\r\ninhabitants were crowded together, and from being deprived of their\r\nusual resources for the disposal of their dead, the sickening horrors\r\nof the pestilence were accumulated tenfold before the eyes of the\r\nunfortunate survivors, and thus constituted an additional aggravation\r\nof their sufferings. The burial-places were laid under water, and while\r\nthe disposition and power lasted to bury their dead, every open space,\r\nsays an eye-witness,--the streets, the courtyards of mosques, and even\r\nstables,--were turned up to furnish graves. In one stable-yard, which\r\nthe terrace of our house overlooked, says the same writer, nearly one\r\nhundred graves were opened, and filled in the course of one day and a\r\nhalf; it was a fearful sight indeed to see the uncoffined dead brought\r\nin barrows and on the backs of asses, and laid upon the ground, till\r\nthe graves were made ready for them. As the mortality increased, the\r\ndead were thrown out into the streets, and were greedily devoured by\r\nthe ravenous dogs which swarm in all the cities of the East. He did\r\nmuch, then, who took the dead of his household to the river side and\r\nthrew them in. The pressure of famine was also greatly felt,--the\r\ninundation cut off all supplies from the country round about; no fresh\r\nprovisions of any kind could be had, and although the higher classes,\r\nwho generally had a stock of corn on hand, were preserved from absolute\r\nwant, nevertheless respectable persons were seen in crowds begging from\r\ndoor to door for food.\r\n\r\nTo continue: about the month of May, an epidemic disease made its\r\nappearance in Paris, which on comparison presented symptoms analogous\r\nto those of the epidemic pestilence described by Sauvages as occurring\r\nA.D. 1743, and also to that described by Ruyoux, A.D. 1762. The term\r\n‘la grippe’ was thought applicable to it.\r\n\r\nAs occurred in the epidemics of which we have spoken, and as has been\r\nobserved in former times, and noted by Rivére, Senertus, Sydenham,\r\nLoes, Huxham, and many others, a remarkable analogy was noticed between\r\nthe ‘medical constitution’ which had existed for some months past,\r\nand the development of this epidemic. All authors who have given\r\ndescriptions of catarrhal epidemics similar to that of which we are\r\nwriting, agree in saying that they have almost invariably followed cold\r\nand moist seasons, and that they seemed more immediately to be produced\r\nby sudden atmospheric vicissitudes.\r\n\r\nThese facts harmonize with those observed in Paris. The malady\r\ncommenced with symptoms of coryza, attended by cough and snuffling;\r\ndyspnea, with severe bronchial irritation, supervened, when the\r\nparoxysm all at once became greatly aggravated. One symptom was\r\nremarked as being pretty general and prominent, viz., a feeling of\r\nlassitude and fatigue of the limbs, with more or less great moral\r\nprostration: the disease was not very fatal, and generally lasted\r\nfor eight or ten days. During this period an extraordinary epidemic\r\nprevailed at a village called Mandroros, in Russia,--gangrene of the\r\nspleen. From the singular nature of this disease, a description will\r\nprobably be found interesting. It commenced without any premonitory\r\nsymptoms; the patient was suddenly seized with a feeling of burning\r\nat the pit of the stomach, accompanied by an insupportable pain in\r\nthe left hypochondria; lassitude, with vomiting of a greenish bitter\r\nfluid, bowels naturally active, urine scanty, loss of appetite, and\r\nlaborious respiration. Putrid appearances supervened in the course of a\r\nfew hours, followed by meteorismus, borborygmi, yellowness of the skin,\r\nand of the scleroticæ; facies Hippocratica, cramps, cold extremities,\r\nand death. This disease, it is said, was not contagious, but epidemic,\r\nand it is further stated to have resembled that which was called ‘the\r\nplague of Siberia.’ After death, decomposition of the corpses took\r\nplace rapidly, a black spot first appearing over the splenic region.\r\nNecrotomy showed the spleen in an engorged and gangrenous condition.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1831, cholera made its appearance in Sunderland, and a\r\nmonth after in Newcastle-upon-Tyne; it visited Houghton-le-Spring,\r\nNorth Shields, Tynemouth, South Shields, Gateshead, and other places.\r\nThe first appearance of it in London is reported to have taken place in\r\nthe following year, 1832, in the month of February, in the immediate\r\nvicinity of the shipping; but solitary cases were met with in the close\r\nfilthy quarters of the very poor, early in December. In Scotland it had\r\nmade its appearance previously about Christmas; and in the following\r\nJanuary, Leith and Edinburgh suffered greatly. During this period\r\nit broke out in France, Holland, and in the peninsula generally. In\r\nthe summer of 1832 cholera prevailed throughout England, Scotland,\r\nIreland, and Wales, and in the Channel Islands, Jersey, Guernsey, &c.,\r\nand also among the emigrants arriving at Quebec; from the latter city\r\nit extended to Montreal, Kingston on the Lake Ontario, and to the\r\nsurrounding neighbourhood. Soon afterwards, New York and Albany, in\r\nthe United States, were attacked, and in due time the disease extended\r\nto Philadelphia, to Newcastle on the Delaware river, and to many other\r\nparts of the United States; it raged at New Orleans, as did also yellow\r\nfever: it made its appearance at the Havannah in the month of July,\r\n1833. During the spring of that year influenza spread over every part\r\nof Great Britain and Ireland: it had raged previously in Russia and the\r\nnorthern parts of Germany, where it had inflicted great mortality in\r\nits course.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of March, Paris was again invaded by cholera, and the\r\ninhabitants of Calais also suffered greatly; in Paris, at least 20,000\r\npersons had fallen victims to this scourge by the end of September.\r\nDuring this year and the following, it raged throughout Spain, and was\r\nespecially destructive in Madrid. Numerous places on the borders of the\r\nMediterranean were visited by this pestilence, and it re-appeared in\r\nLondon and in other places in this country, as well as in North America.\r\n\r\nFrom the year 1833 to 1838, plague raged with great violence, carrying\r\noff vast numbers, in Constantinople, Cairo, Alexandria, and Smyrna.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1834, cholera was rife at Gibraltar; it extended to the rock, and\r\nno one seems to have escaped the disease. A singular phenomenon, a\r\nshower of fish, was noticed on the 17th of May in the neighbourhood of\r\nAllahabad. The zemindars of the village have furnished the following\r\nparticulars, which were confirmed by other accounts:--About noon, the\r\nwind being from the west, and a few distant clouds visible, there was\r\na blast of high wind accompanied with much dust, of a reddish yellow\r\ncolour, with which the atmosphere was greatly charged. The blast\r\nappeared to extend in breadth about 400 yards; immense trees and large\r\nbuildings were thrown down, and when the storm had passed away, the\r\nground all about the village was found strewed with small fish to the\r\nextent of two bijahs: the fish were all of the chalwa species (_clopea\r\ncultrata_, Shakespeare Dictionary); they were a span or rather less\r\nin length, and from one sear to one and a half in weight; when found\r\nthey were all dead and dry. The Jumna runs about three miles south of\r\nthe village, and the Ganges fourteen W. by E. The fish were not fit\r\nfor eating, and it was said that when put in the pan for dressing they\r\nturned into blood!\r\n\r\nThe writer of a history of cholera, published in the ‘Lancet,’ says:\r\n“From the earliest times it has been a matter of common observation\r\nthat plagues and murrains among the lower animals not unfrequently\r\neither preceded or accompanied the visitations to which mankind were\r\nsubjected. Thus, at the siege of Troy, we are told by Homer:\r\n\r\n                            μετὰ δ’ ἰὸν ἔηκε·\r\n    Δεινὴ δὲ κλαγγὴ γένετ’ ἀργύρεοιο βιοῖο.\r\n    Οὐρῆας μὲν πρῶtον ἐπῴχετο, καὶ κύνας ἀργούς·\r\n    Αὐτὰρ ἔπειτ’ αὐτοîσι βέλος ἐχεπευκὲς ἐφιεἰς\r\n    Βάλλ’.”\r\n\r\nIn India, we are informed that poultry and dogs frequently perished\r\nduring the prevalence of cholera, and with similar symptoms. At\r\nMarienburgh, in Prussia, in the year 1831, the fish in the large ponds\r\nin that government are all said to have perished during the prevalence\r\nof the epidemic, and forty tons of them were buried from the single\r\npond of Dinperburgh. In Warsaw, some examples of a disease resembling\r\ncholera were also noticed among the lower animals.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of this year, A.D. 1834, the Egyptian\r\ndominions of the Pasha suffered greatly from the ravages of pestilence\r\nor plague. It first appeared in Alexandria, where it was reported to\r\nhave been brought from Malta: sanitary precautions were adopted, but\r\nthe prejudices of the people rendered them unavailing, and they were\r\nconsequently abandoned as being useless. By the end of February, the\r\ndeaths in Alexandria amounted to 200 daily. The disease then extended\r\nto Grand Cairo, and soon after stretched up the valley of the Nile,\r\nsweeping off the greater part of the population. In the month of March,\r\nthe deaths were computed to be from 300 to 400 daily at Cairo; in\r\nMay they had increased to nearly 2000. The town of Fua, situated on\r\nthe banks of the Nile, containing a population of 2500 inhabitants,\r\nwas stated to have lost 1800 in a very short period. The distemper\r\ndisappeared as the year advanced, but its ravages, together with the\r\nlong-continued military exertions of the Pasha, left Egypt almost\r\ndepopulated.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the year 1835, there happened an eruption of\r\nVesuvius, which has been thus described by an eye-witness:--A new\r\ncrater having burst out, a stream of red-hot lava issued therefrom, in\r\nthe direction of Castelmare, spreading itself over several miles in a\r\nfew hours’ time, its course being marked by flames rising in volumes\r\nfrom the ground over which it flowed. The intense heat occasioned by\r\nthis body of fire was felt at Sorrento. The same year, an earthquake\r\nwas experienced in South America on the 20th of February; it caused\r\nthe destruction of the cities of Talar and Carico, with the towns of\r\nConquenes, Linares, and Chillian: not a house was left standing in a\r\nplace called Conception, and the workmen who were engaged repairing\r\nthe cathedral of that city were buried in the ruins. In the month\r\nof June, hail and thunderstorms did much damage in various parts of\r\nEngland; on the 9th, 10th, and 11th, different parts of the country\r\nsuffered greatly; the destruction of glass in the neighbourhood of\r\nCambridge, on the 9th, was estimated at £2000. In Newmarket a similar\r\nloss of property occurred. In Durham the lightning struck the western\r\ntower of the cathedral, and hurled down an immense mass of stone,\r\nwhich, alighting upon the pavement beneath, was dashed into innumerable\r\nfragments, at the moment when a party of students belonging to the\r\nuniversity, who had been inspecting a monument recently erected,\r\nalarmed by the crash, rushed from the cathedral; two of the party were\r\nkilled instantly by the falling ruin, and ten others were severely\r\nwounded. About this period, in the month of January, the little village\r\nof Raffhaten, on the frontiers of Wallachia, was the locality in which\r\nthere occurred the singular phenomenon of a shower of meteorolites:\r\nabout 6 A.M., on the 29th of January, the inhabitants were\r\naroused from sleep by a noise as of a heavy shower of hail, which was\r\nimmediately succeeded by a violent crashing of windows; great was the\r\nastonishment subsequently to find that the earth, for the space of\r\nnearly two leagues in circumference, was covered with a vast number of\r\nsmall stones, the smallest of them being about a quarter of an inch\r\nin diameter, while the largest were about the size of a marble; they\r\nwere of a light slate colour, and very heavy, as much so as pieces of\r\nmetal of the same size; when put into the fire, they burnt like coal,\r\nemitting a considerable quantity of gas at the same time.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of August the shock of an earthquake was felt in different\r\nparts of the county of Lancaster: at Clitheroe two shocks were\r\nexperienced,--the first, occurring about twelve at night, was slight;\r\nthe second happened about half-past three in the morning; a rumbling\r\nnoise like distant thunder was first heard, and was instantaneously\r\nfollowed by a violent shaking of the doors, windows, and furniture in\r\nall the houses in the district; many persons started from their beds\r\nin great terror, and rushed into the streets. It was felt at Downham,\r\nWisewell, Pendleton, Milton, Waddington, and in all the surrounding\r\nvillages to Blackpool. The shock was also felt at Liverpool, at\r\nUlverstone, Kendal, Garstang, Preston, and Blackburn, where it caused\r\nserious and general alarm.\r\n\r\nCholera, this year, 1835, was rife at Leghorn, where it carried off\r\nsixty or seventy persons daily. On the 25th of August, Odessa suffered\r\nfrom a severe shock of an earthquake; it was first felt about five\r\nin the afternoon, when a thick smoke of vapour arose at the foot of\r\nMount Ard-scheh (on the side of which Kassarich is situated), from\r\nwhich columns of flames burst with a tremendous noise; it was like the\r\neruption of a volcano. At the same moment the earth was felt to rock,\r\nand a terrible earthquake began, the shocks of which continued for\r\nseven successive hours, accompanied with heavy thunder; persons felt\r\nas though they were on the ocean when agitated violently by a storm:\r\nabout two thousand houses were thrown down; confusion and terror were\r\nat their height; the inhabitants fled into the country, but many were\r\novertaken in their flight and buried in the ruins: an incredible number\r\nthus perished. Up to the 1st of September, there were three or four\r\nshocks daily, but of a trifling nature, doing but little mischief.\r\nAbout this time the inhabitants of Kassarich, who had taken up their\r\nabode in the fields, or fled into the villages, were able to return\r\nto the town; all the villages to the distance of more than 140 miles\r\nhad suffered dreadfully; a great number of lives had been lost in\r\nmost of them, and many houses and other property had been destroyed.\r\nThe following are those who suffered the most;--at Tanlusia upwards\r\nof sixty houses were thrown down, and many lives lost; great numbers\r\nwere killed at Tapirarchi, and Kerwer suffered greatly. The village\r\nof Mantzofir was that which suffered the most. In Welekes only one\r\nhouse was left standing, and great numbers lost their lives. Wersan\r\nwas completely swallowed up, as was also Kumetzi, on the site of which\r\na great lake afterwards arose. This year, 1835, may be said to have\r\nbeen marked by a series of commotions; for in the month of November, in\r\nthe middle of the night, an earthquake was felt generally throughout\r\nCalabria, Citra, &c.; it was followed by ten shocks at intervals. In\r\nthe midst of these commotions, Castiglioni, a commune in the district\r\nof Cosenza, was levelled with the ground, and the greater part of the\r\npopulation met an untimely death. The small village of Bonello shared\r\na similar fate. In Leppano, in Ronda, in Casole, and various other\r\nplaces, great sufferings from the falling of the houses were endured.\r\nEpidemics were prevalent all this year and the year following, 1836,\r\nin various parts of the globe. In Europe, America (North and South),\r\nand in the greater part of the West Indian Islands, an apoplectic,\r\npernicious fever, as it was termed, was prevalent in the northern\r\nhemisphere.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1836. For two days the weather was exceedingly\r\nboisterous, and the wind blowing hard from the north-east. On Sunday,\r\nthe 1st of May, the stormy winds increased, the land was darkened with\r\nheavy clouds of dust, and the Thames all day appeared as rough as a\r\ntroubled sea. The effects of the storm were visible both on the land\r\nand sea: numbers of houses were unroofed, and nursery gardens, with\r\nother property, destroyed.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of October, at about eight in the evening, the heavens\r\npresented one of the most splendid of those phenomena known as the\r\n‘auroræ boreales,’ or northern lights. There first appeared a large\r\nluminous arch extending nearly from north to south, from which\r\nstreamers extended very low in the sky, running from north-east to\r\nsouth-west, and increasing in number until they began to approach the\r\nzenith, apparently with an accelerated velocity. Suddenly the whole\r\nhemisphere was covered with them. This splendid scene, however, lasted\r\nonly about forty seconds: the variety of colours disappeared, and the\r\nbeams lost their lateral motion, and were converted, as is usual, into\r\nflashing radiations, which kept diminishing in splendour until the\r\nwhole disappeared, leaving only a pale white light near the horizon.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1837, cholera prevailed at Rome, causing great mortality,\r\nfrom 200 to 300 dying daily. Of the frightful mortality of this dire\r\nscourge one writer states, that in the Indian peninsula, from the years\r\n1817 to 1830, of a population numbering somewhat more than 4,000,000,\r\n1,800,000 became victims. Another author gives the following summary of\r\nthe numbers carried off during this pestilential period:--\r\n\r\nAt Erivan and Tauris one-fourth of the population were destroyed. In\r\nSyria its ravages were extremely varied; in some localities, one-half\r\nof the populace were carried off; whilst in others, as in Tripoli,\r\nonly one in about 200 died. At Tiflis, three-fourths of those seized\r\nperished; at Astrachan, two-thirds were carried off. Out of 16,000\r\nattacked in the province of Caucasus, 10,000 fell victims; at Moscow,\r\none-half, and at Orenburg only one-fifth of the inhabitants perished.\r\nOut of 54,000 and upwards attacked in the Russian provinces, more than\r\n31,000 died. In Hungary, 400,000 were said to have been seized, and\r\nmore than half were destroyed. In this country (England) and in Wales,\r\naccording to the Tables furnished by Dr. Merriman, from the Reports\r\nsent in for the Privy Council, out of 62,000 attacked, 20,578 died.\r\nIn Ireland, out of 54,552 who were taken ill, 21,171 fell victims.\r\nIn the countries of Asia not subject to European dominion, the data\r\nrespecting the ravages of this disease were extremely vague and scanty,\r\nalthough there is reason to believe that in some of them they were more\r\nextensive than in India.\r\n\r\nYellow fever prevailed in various parts of the United States from\r\nthe year 1834 until 1839, especially in Charleston. The causes were\r\nsupposed to have been dependent on the extreme heat of the summer,--the\r\nelevation of temperature having been greatly beyond what was ever\r\nbefore known. The town was also crowded by strangers, who were employed\r\nto rebuild the city after its conflagration: they were badly lodged;\r\nand, in consequence of the high wages that were given, an immense\r\nnumber of dissolute and intemperate persons were attracted to the city.\r\nIt was chiefly among this class that the disease prevailed.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1837, influenza appeared in London in the first week\r\nin January, the weather during the preceding four months having been\r\nsingularly wet, cold, and stormy; large quantities of snow having\r\nfallen and collected on the ground, even in the streets of London,\r\nwhere it lay for weeks together. The evaporation of the cold water,\r\nthe result of the succeeding thaw, rendered the air cold and damp\r\nfor a long time. In the month of November, this year, a hurricane of\r\ngreat violence occurred from the south-west. On Christmas-day there\r\nwas a storm of wind and snow simultaneously all over the west of\r\nEurope,--snow having fallen even in the streets of Lisbon and Palermo:\r\nit fell so heavily in England, that it impeded intercourse throughout\r\nthe country. It was remarkable that snow fell at Canton in February, a\r\nthing unknown to the oldest inhabitants. The French army marching upon\r\nConstantina, in Algiers, suffered severely from three days of incessant\r\nsnow. Tremendous hurricanes were experienced about this period over\r\nevery part of the European and American seas. The weather in England\r\nwas uncertain and fluctuating from Christmas to the middle of February,\r\nwhen influenza broke out: its duration in London was six or seven\r\nweeks; half the population were attacked, and the ordinary rates of\r\nmortality during this time were very nearly doubled. The aged and the\r\nvery young were those who principally suffered. The inhabitants of\r\nRussia, Sweden, and Denmark suffered greatly. In Copenhagen, according\r\nto Dr. Otto, at least 30,000 were labouring under the disease at one\r\ntime, in the month of January. Influenza was rife also in Scotland,\r\nwhere it was observed earlier than in England, and it broke out\r\ngenerally in the northern and eastern parts of England before it showed\r\nitself in the southern and western. Paris was visited by this epidemic\r\na month later than London, the disease having previously prevailed in\r\nCalais and other intervening places. It broke out with great severity\r\nin the northern coast of Spain, being aggravated by the events of the\r\ncivil war then raging in Biscay and Navarre. An epidemic having the\r\ncharacter of the influenza of the northern hemisphere was also rife at\r\nSydney and the Cape of Good Hope in the latter part of the year 1836.\r\n\r\nTowards the latter end of March, 1838, yellow fever broke out among\r\nthe garrison and the inhabitants in the island of Ascension, and\r\ncommitted great ravages. The disease was preceded by heavy rains for\r\nseveral days: large collections of water formed in consequence, which\r\nevaporated under the influence of a burning sun. One of the most\r\nextensive of these occurred in a foul and offensive site, surrounded\r\nby low dwelling-houses occupied by Portuguese prisoners, the majority\r\nof whom were attacked. The men employed in pumping out this water,\r\ncomplained much of its offensive effluvium; they also suffered from\r\nthe fever, and that most severely. The epidemic extended to the crews\r\nof several ships of war which touched at the island, and many of the\r\nseamen and officers perished.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1839. In the month of February, an epidemic pestilence\r\nbroke out, and proceeded with the rapidity of lightning at Mount St.\r\nBernard. It was characterized by typhoid symptoms, and attended by a\r\nlengthened delirium, with occasional short, lucid intervals; out of\r\none family consisting of twenty-one individuals, three only survived:\r\nit was confined exclusively to those living on the mountain. Epidemic\r\nerysipelas raged with great intensity at Algiers during this period;\r\nepidemic disease also prevailed in the district of Coulommiers in\r\nFrance, termed ‘sudor miliaris.’ The premonitory symptoms varied very\r\ngenerally: some of those attacked, when they awoke, found themselves\r\ninundated with perspiration; in some, the disease was preceded for\r\nsome days by prostration of strength, with pains in the joints, &c.:\r\na prominent symptom was a pain and sensation of smothering in the\r\nepigastric region; this feeling was greater or less in proportion\r\nto the quantity of perspiration, which in some was so profuse that\r\non lifting up the bed-clothes a dense vapour was seen to arise: an\r\neruption appeared after the third or fourth day; ten days after,\r\nthe epidermis became wrinkled and fell off in the shape of scaly\r\nfurfuraceous matter. The most fatal cases were those in which agonizing\r\npains were experienced at the epigastrium. The autopsiæ exhibited\r\nvesicular eruptions in the intestinal canal. Petechial fever was very\r\nprevalent at St. Petersburgh this year (1839); it affected persons\r\nin a peculiar manner; during their illness, there was no delirium or\r\nappearance of disorder of the intellectual faculties; they spoke and\r\nacted sensibly, but after the subsidence of the malady, towards the end\r\nof the third or fourth week, they awoke as it were to a consciousness\r\nof their condition. Measles also raged epidemically. Yellow fever,\r\nthis year (1839), was very destructive at Galveston in the republic of\r\nTexas.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1840, blight appeared in Germany among the crops,\r\nespecially the potato; it prevailed to so great an extent, Dr. Martius\r\nreports, as to cause a very serious alarm, and even to threaten the\r\ntotal extinction of that esculent. At the same time, the island of\r\nArran, with other parts of the Highlands of Scotland, suffered from a\r\nsimilar disease among the potato crops: it prevailed there from 1839 to\r\n1842, destroying at least half the vegetation.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1841, plague raged in Syria, and at Erzeroum with great\r\nviolence. During this period, extending to the year following, 1842,\r\nan epidemic religious ecstasy, as it was called, prevailed in Sweden.\r\nThis singular epidemic malady was distinguished by two prominent and\r\nremarkable symptoms,--one physical, consisting of spasm, or involuntary\r\ncontractions or contortions, &c.; the other, mental, being an ecstasy,\r\nmore or less involuntary, during which the patients fancied themselves\r\ndivinely inspired, and felt impelled to speak of supernatural things\r\nwhich they fancied they saw; they were occasionally moved to preach. It\r\nwas the female portion of the community that suffered most. Anything\r\noffensive to the mind re-acted convulsively on the body, causing a\r\nsort of chorea, which it was attempted to distinguish or divide into\r\ntwo distinct forms of the disease, called mental and physical chorea.\r\nSeveral thousand persons were attacked by the disease; it was rarely\r\nfatal. Persons who had been affected, when convalescing, felt languid\r\nand debilitated, both in body and mind. Yellow fever at this period\r\nwas fatal at Key West, East Florida, in the United States. Early in\r\n1841 remittent fever occurred among the crew of the ‘Wanderer’ a ship\r\nbelonging to the Royal Navy, chiefly among the boats’ crews who had\r\nbeen employed in the rivers Nunez and Pongos. Seventy persons were\r\ntaken ill, and nine died. In the course of this year, remittent fever\r\nprevailed in many other Queen’s ships employed on the African coast to\r\nput down the slave trade.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1843. Blight seized on the potato crop this year\r\nthroughout the United States, and also in British America. Epidemic\r\nerysipelas, known by the popular name of ‘the black tongue,’ broke\r\nout in November, 1843, in Ripley county, United States, and traversed\r\nmost of the townships of the Delaware, Dearborn county, &c. This\r\ndisease, Dr. Sutton says, “has either assumed several characters, or\r\nwe have several epidemics traversing the country together: one was\r\nerysipelas connected with cynanche tonsillaris, or swelling of some\r\nof the lymphatic glands in the throat; and another was considered to\r\nbe a typhoid pneumonia, sometimes accompanied by enlargement of the\r\naxillary glands. These two diseases,” continued the writer, “have\r\nbeen so intimately connected in my practice, that it has been a\r\nquestion to me whether the last was not a pulmonic erysipelas, the\r\npremonitory symptoms in each disease being alike, the character of\r\nthe fever in each being the same, and it was often the case that one\r\nform of the disease changed into that of the other. The disease was\r\nnot generally fatal.” Boston, in the autumn of this year, was visited\r\nby an epidemic fever; it prevailed also at a place called Erie in\r\nthe county of New York, during the months of October and November.\r\nThis little town, or rather settlement, Erie, is made up of some\r\nhalf-dozen houses, containing a population of forty-three persons, of\r\nwhich number twenty-eight were seized between the 19th November and\r\n7th December, ten of them dying of the disease. Some disputes existed\r\nin this little community, and the generality of them were of opinion\r\nthat the wells had been poisoned by some evil-disposed persons: there\r\nwas not, however, the least foundation for any such supposition. The\r\ndisease commenced with rigors, chills, pain in the loins and head;\r\ntyphoid symptoms supervened, the tongue becoming brown and dry; low\r\nmuttering delirium was noticed, also a cough, with expectoration of a\r\nmuco-purulent character. Another small town which about this period\r\nwas visited by a very fatal disease, yellow fever, is an inland\r\nsettlement in Wilkinson county, Mississippi, containing a population\r\nof 750 inhabitants. It is situated about forty miles from Natchez, on\r\nhigh ground, 340 feet above the level or bank of the Mississippi with\r\na gradual slope in all directions; there is no creek, pond, or low\r\nland near the town,--in short, on a review of the town and surrounding\r\ncountry, it would be pronounced to be one of the most eligible sites\r\nin the south for a healthy settlement. At the time there was no yellow\r\nfever prevalent at New Orleans,--in fact, there had not been any case\r\nof the disease in any place along the river; consequently it could not\r\nhave been imported. Nearly every one in the town was seized; and the\r\nmortality was great, seven to ten dying daily in so small a population\r\nfor the first week. The disease was very rapid in its progress; the\r\npatients were suddenly seized with violent pains in the head and loins,\r\nand with burning fever; in a short time vomiting of a blackish fluid,\r\nsimilar to coffee-grounds, ensued, and in a few hours death closed the\r\nscene.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1842 and 1843, cholera in a sporadic form raged with\r\nconsiderable violence in many parts of Persia, continuing at intervals\r\nduring the two subsequent years.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1844, yellow pestilence committed great ravages at Goree,\r\nin Senegal.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1845, the blight among the potatoes spread rapidly\r\nthrough Germany, Holland, Belgium, the northern parts of France, and\r\nover the greater portion of England, Scotland, and Ireland. This\r\npestilence re-appeared the year following, 1846. A phenomenon worthy of\r\nnotice was observed during the prevalence of this disease,--to wit, the\r\nexistence of a mist or fogs immediately previous to the blight in the\r\ncrops. In Holland, a thick stinking mist, which extended very widely,\r\nwas observed in 1845, antecedent to the potato blight. M. Petit states\r\nthat it was generally remarked in France that the disease made its\r\nappearance after a fog. In England the same phenomenon was observed.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1845 remittent fever broke out on board the ‘Eclair,’\r\nwhile on the coast of Africa; the first persons attacked being those\r\nwho had been engaged in boat-service. The vessel at the time lay off\r\nthe Sherbro’ river, and the boats had been employed for some time\r\nexploring its creeks, and those in the Seabar branch of that river.\r\nThe disease continued to spread among the boats’ crews; and after a\r\nwhile those seamen who had not been out of the ship became subject to\r\nthe fever, which committed such fearful ravages among them that at\r\nlast the ‘Eclair’ was ordered home as a _dernier ressort_. The\r\ndisease then presented all the characters of genuine yellow fever. On\r\nthe voyage, the ‘Eclair,’ after having been refused pratique at Goree,\r\nput in at Boa Vista, one of the Cape de Verd Islands, where the crew\r\nwere landed, and stayed some days; but the epidemic continued to seize\r\nits victims, and the crew consequently, both the sick and sound, were\r\nagain received on board, and the vessel got under weigh for England.\r\nBefore she reached Madeira, Captain Estcourt, Dr. M’Clure, and Mr.\r\nHartmann, the assistant surgeon, died, Mr. Machonchy, the surgeon to\r\nthe ship, expiring the day after. Mr. Sydney Bernard, assistant surgeon\r\nof the ‘Growler,’ having volunteered his services, was appointed in\r\nMr. Machonchy’s place, and performed his duties to the last. On the\r\narrival of this floating pest-house in England, pratique was refused,\r\nand the healthy, the sick, and the dying were all kept on board. The\r\nresult was the loss of several more lives, the disease not ceasing\r\nuntil about a fortnight after her arrival at the Motherbank. Mr. Sydney\r\nBernard and Lieutenant Isaacson, the officer in command, were among its\r\nlatest victims. The deaths on board from the endemic, from first to\r\nlast, amounted to seventy-four. Fever prevailed very extensively in Boa\r\nVista, after the departure of the ‘Eclair,’ and was very fatal; great\r\nnumbers of the inhabitants were attacked.\r\n\r\nIn 1846, during the march of the Mormon worshippers across the desert,\r\non their road to the new state of Deseret or Utah, after their\r\nexpulsion from Nauvoo, they were greatly afflicted by endemic disease,\r\nchiefly remittent and yellow fevers. In one camp alone, 31 per cent.\r\nsuffered, and the road was marked throughout with the graves of those\r\nwho perished. They also suffered much from a kind of strange scorbutic\r\ndisease, which they named the ‘black canker,’ and which was frequently\r\nfatal.\r\n\r\nAt this time it was remarked, a few days before disease fastened on the\r\npotatoes, that a dense cloud, resembling a thick fog, overspread the\r\nentire country; it differed from a common fog in being quite dry and\r\nhaving a disagreeable odour.\r\n\r\nTo continue: this year and the following, 1847, epidemic remittent\r\nfever was prevalent in Scotland. In Glasgow it was noticed that a\r\nremarkable change had taken place in the epidemic constitution.\r\nExanthematous typhus--a sort of continued fever, characterized along\r\nwith other symptoms by an eruption over the body resembling measles,\r\nrunning a course on an average of twenty-one days, carrying off\r\nabout 10 per cent.,--was supplanted by a remittent fever, sometimes\r\nattended with petechiæ, but not with the measly eruption: it was also\r\noften accompanied by jaundice. Epistaxis was very frequent; when the\r\ndisease occurred in women about the menstrual period, the discharge was\r\nuniversally copious, and very many women in a state of pregnancy, who\r\nwere seized with the malady, aborted; a crisis generally was formed on\r\nthe seventh day; relapses were frequent,--in fact, almost invariable\r\nunder any and every precaution: the mortality amounted to about 3½ per\r\ncent.; about 15,000 persons fell victims to this disease, principally\r\nthose residing in the ill-ventilated and filthy parts of the town,--the\r\npoor and distressed. The smallness of the mortality compared with the\r\nseverity of the symptoms, and the debility it left behind, was a matter\r\nof surprise. This malady appears to have been very similar to that\r\nwhich prevailed in Dublin in 1826. Rutty, in his diseases of Dublin\r\nduring forty years, mentions several epidemics which resembled the\r\nmalady at Glasgow. They occurred in 1740, 1745, 1764, and 1765. There\r\nis also some resemblance between this fever and that which prevailed in\r\nDublin in 1816, as reported by Dr. Stokes.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of 1845 cholera prevailed with great violence\r\nalong the banks of the Indus, and about the same period proved very\r\ndestructive in Afghanistan. Thence it extended into Persia, traversing\r\nthat country from east to west, spread northwards into Tartary, and\r\nsouthwards into Kurdistan, and also into the pashalic of Baghdad. In\r\nSeptember it prevailed at Herat and Samarcand, and in the November\r\nfollowing at Bokhara. The extreme malignancy of the disease may be\r\nunderstood by the description given of many of the cases. “Those who\r\nwere attacked dropped suddenly down in a state of lethargy, and at the\r\nend of two or three hours expired without any convulsions or vomiting,\r\nbut from complete stagnation of the blood, which no remedies could\r\nrestore to circulation.”\r\n\r\nDuring this period there took place in Kurrachee, near the mouth of\r\nthe Indus, the most terrific outburst of the pestilence that can be\r\nconceived, which in the course of a few days swept off 8000 victims.\r\nThe description given by an eye-witness of the scene at Kurrachee, as\r\nDr. Gavin Milroy says (in his very excellent pamphlet on cholera), is\r\nso full of fearful and instructive interest, as regards some of the\r\nmost striking characters of pestilential visitations, that we cannot\r\nwithhold a brief account of its leading particulars:--\r\n\r\nThe heat had been intense during the first fortnight in June, but the\r\nstation remained tolerably healthy. On Sunday, the 14th, the atmosphere\r\nwas more than usually stagnant and oppressive; one correspondent\r\nwho was present says, “The very heavens seemed drawn down upon our\r\nshoulders; the feeling was suffocating.” A dark portentous-looking\r\ncloud crept up the sky as the troops were proceeding to church, and\r\na sudden gust of wind threatened the building: it passed away almost\r\nas suddenly as it came; and when the worshippers retired, the air was\r\nas still as when they assembled. At the same hour did the pestilence\r\nappear; before midnight nine soldiers of the 86th regiment were dead,\r\nand men began to be brought to the hospital in such numbers, that\r\nit was difficult to make arrangements for their reception; it was a\r\nfearful night. With morning, came the tidings that the pestilence\r\nwas overspreading the town, and that fifty persons had already fallen\r\nvictims to its deadly poison. How awful must have been the rapidity\r\nof the attack, when we learn that sometimes, within little more than\r\nfive minutes, hale and hearty men were seized, cramped, collapsed,\r\nand dead! Men attending the burial of their comrades were attacked,\r\ncarried to the hospital, and were themselves buried the next morning.\r\nPits were dug in the churchyard, morning and evening; sewn up in their\r\nbedding, and coffinless, the dead were laid side by side, one service\r\nbeing read over all! For the next five days it raged with appalling\r\nfury; it then abated in its intensity, but continued to hover about the\r\nplace for another week. Within less than a fortnight, 900 Europeans,\r\nincluding 815 fighting men, were swept away. Besides these, 600 native\r\nsoldiers and 7000 of the camp-followers and inhabitants of the town had\r\nbeen hurried into eternity. About this time, a virulent fever raged at\r\nSukkur, about 180 miles from Kurrachee, which proved fatal in a few\r\nhours. Hyderabad, intermediate between the two places, was visited\r\nalmost immediately afterwards by cholera. Mr. Alexander Thom, surgeon\r\nof the 86th regiment, at the time of the explosion at Kurrachee, thus\r\nexpresses himself: “I have witnessed disease of a severe and fatal\r\nkind, and cholera itself in an apparently grave form, but I never could\r\nhave anticipated, even in India, its appearance in so appalling a\r\nshape as that in which it was recently developed in the 86th regiment:\r\nit burst forth almost literally like a thunder-clap, followed by a\r\nlethiferous blast, proving almost instantaneously fatal.”\r\n\r\nA.D. 1846, fearful mortality from famine and epidemic\r\npestilence occurred in Gallicia: during the first half-year, 1234\r\ndeaths occurred, and for the like period in the subsequent year the\r\nmortality was 5188! During this time the weather was distressingly hot\r\nin Canada, North America, the thermometer frequently standing 96° and\r\n98°; numbers were carried off daily by fever. Epidemic cholera, after\r\nraging with very great violence for two years in Persia, towards the\r\nend of the summer of 1846, broke out at Tauris and Teheran, and during\r\nthe autumn advanced to places nearer to the Russian frontiers. On the\r\n16th of November, 1846, cases occurred at the village of Ialiany, and\r\nalso in the same month at Leukoran; and it is worthy of remark, that\r\nthese were the places first attacked in 1830. The disease also appeared\r\nat Bakrou, and advanced in December to Schêmakha and Derbent; and in\r\nthe month of February, 1847, to the town of Konba. Its appearance at\r\nIaliany and in the district of Talysch was marked with that malignity\r\nwhich for the most part characterizes the commencement of cholera. We\r\nobserve at Ialiany a remarkable instance of the influence of the trade\r\nand locality tending to foster it, selecting for its victims those who\r\nhad but recently recovered from the fever of the country: the cholera\r\nalmost invariably carried off every one attacked, nine-tenths falling\r\nvictims to the disease. In the localities of the trans-Caucasian\r\nprovinces, the attacks became less violent, and without the towns\r\nthe disease no longer presented a malignant type. Towards the end of\r\nFebruary, it was supposed that the disease had ceased, but in the\r\nfollowing month, March, it recommenced with redoubled violence, and\r\nin April spread destruction with fearful rapidity. Traversing the\r\nshores of the Caspian sea, it reached Tiflis in May. It also appeared\r\nin this month on the other side of the Caucasus, at Kizliar, whence,\r\nre-ascending the Terek, it penetrated to Mozdok, at the end of June to\r\nPiatigorsk and to Georgierk, and entered Staowpol in the first week of\r\nJuly.\r\n\r\nFrom October, 1846, to June, 1847, there occurred in the Caucasus and\r\ntrans-Caucasian provinces no less than 17,055 cases of cholera, of\r\nwhich 6318 died. Astrachan suffered greatly from cholera, great numbers\r\nof the inhabitants having been carried off, as was also the case in\r\nMoscow. From official accounts received from St. Petersburgh, it\r\nappeared the inhabitants of the western town Alexandrof were attacked\r\nwith cholera, and also the district of Olgapol, in Podolia. The latter\r\nis about thirty miles distant from the Austrian frontiers.\r\n\r\nA.D. 1846 and 1847, an epizootic or murrain destroyed much\r\ncattle in Europe, principally oxen; dogs, horses, and sheep suffering\r\ncomparatively less. Great numbers of horned cattle were destroyed in\r\nWallachia. A kind of pleuro-pneumonia afflicted both men and beasts in\r\nvarious parts of Scotland, principally in East Lothian, as well as in\r\nAberdeenshire, extending throughout the North; it also prevailed in\r\nAyrshire to some extent.\r\n\r\nIn the month of January of the latter year, 1847, influenza prevailed\r\non the coast of Portugal and in the south-east of Spain: it also\r\nappeared in Newfoundland and in New Zealand; and in the month of March,\r\nin Valparaiso; in April, on the coast of Syria: in July, August, and\r\nSeptember, it broke out on the west coast of Africa, south of the\r\nequator; during which time (in August) it raged at Hong-Kong. In the\r\nmonth of December, Paris was assailed by this malady, which was also\r\nrife at Madrid; it was termed ‘la grippe,’ and seized more than half\r\nthe population: five thousand persons were said to have been laid up by\r\nthis wide-spreading disease at one time in Paris. About this period,\r\nthe island of Java was visited by epidemic diseases. Virulent small-pox\r\ncommitted great havoc, and then typhus prevailed in Ireland; the\r\nmortality among the medical profession was great, it being calculated\r\nthat one-fifteenth of the entire medical community died there during\r\nthe year. There was great mortality from typhus at Prague, between the\r\n16th of December, 1846, and the 16th of December, 1847; the deaths\r\nduring that time amounting to 5192. During the latter year, 1847,\r\ncholera was rife in Moscow, Stockholm, St. Petersburgh, and Cronstadt;\r\nvarious parts of Europe were visited by influenza, the greater part of\r\nthe inhabitants of Copenhagen having suffered therefrom: the disease\r\nalso prevailed at Marseilles, attacking half the population of 80,000\r\npersons; its character, however, was mild.\r\n\r\nDuring the last fortnight of November, 1847, an epidemic of rather a\r\nremarkable character broke out, and prevailed in the North of Scotland,\r\ncommencing in Dundee, travelling over the entire coast as far as\r\nKinnaird’s Head, and extending westerly, involving Huntly, Keith,\r\nElgin, and Inverness; it first affected the system by pain in the\r\nthroat, followed by headache, sickness at stomach, and expectoration of\r\na dark, bilious-looking substance. To such an extent did this malady\r\nprevail, that the University and King’s College, then in session, were\r\nclosed; half the students at Marischal College and the university\r\nwere laid up; those at the grammar schools were afflicted in the\r\nsame proportion. At Edinburgh and Montrose the malady prevailed to\r\nan alarming extent, the schools generally having been visited; 810\r\nscholars belonging to the schools in the latter place suffered at one\r\ntime. The weather, which had been damp and rainy, was considered to\r\nbe the principal cause. Yellow fever prevailed at New Orleans, from\r\nthe 5th of July to the 22nd of October; it carried off 2544 persons.\r\nCholera this year prevailed at Trebizond, situated on the oriental\r\nshores of the Black Sea. An author of eminence states that the\r\ninhabitants of this city suffered cruelly: Constantinople was afflicted\r\nabout the same time by dire pestilence, which was fatal to numbers. We\r\nhave also an account of famine and pestilence in Silesia. The famine\r\nand distress at Rybensk and Plesg were appalling; in many parts of the\r\nlatter place 4500 died more than in the preceding year, which was also\r\nvery fatal; from 15 to 20 per cent. of the inhabitants were cut off\r\nby disease. In Rybensk great numbers died daily from famine, and the\r\nCommittee of Relief stated that hundreds of orphan children were seen\r\nstanding beside the corpses of their parents crying for bread.\r\n\r\nDuring the last two years, epidemic pestilence was rife and fatal in\r\nvarious parts of the world. In the latter year, 1847, influenza raged\r\nall over England; and with the following observations, taken as the\r\nsubstance of the Registrar-General’s Report, dated January 30, 1848,\r\nthis History of Epidemic Pestilences will conclude:\r\n\r\nThe meteorological phenomena were particularly remarkable prior to\r\nthe breaking out of the influenza. The population were inadequately\r\nsupplied with potatoes, from scarcity caused by the disease which had\r\nexisted the previous years,--a sort of blight. Scurvy became prevalent\r\nat the beginning of the year. In April, typhus became epidemic, and\r\nthe mortality was increased. Diarrhea, dysentery, and cholera also\r\nprevailed. The wind blew, from the first week in October, S. S. W.\r\nand S. W. The weather was universally warm; a brilliant aurora was\r\nobserved, and shook the magnets, October 24th. It appeared eight times\r\nduring the quarter. On Tuesday, November 16th, there was a remarkable\r\ndarkness; the wind changed to N. W., and amidst various changes still\r\nblew from the north over Greenwich at the rate of 160 and 250 miles a\r\nday. The mean temperature of the air suddenly fell from 11° above to\r\n10° below the average. On Sunday, it was 54°; Friday, 32°; on Friday\r\nnight, 27°. The earth was frozen; the wind was calm three days, and\r\non Saturday evening a dense fog lay over the Thames and London for\r\nthe space of five hours. No electricity stirred in the air during the\r\nweek,--all was still, as if Nature held her breath at the sight of the\r\ndestroyer come forth to sacrifice her children. On Monday, the sky\r\nbecame overcast, the air damp; the wind changed in the night to S. by\r\nE., and passed for four days over Greenwich at the rate of 200 and 300\r\nmiles a day. The temperature suddenly rose, and remained from 2° to 9°\r\nabove the average throughout the week ending on the 27th of November.\r\nInfluenza broke out: in the first week in December, 2454 persons\r\ndied; the week following, 2416 persons, and in six weeks, 11,339. The\r\nepidemic in that time carried off 5000 over and above the mortality of\r\nthe season. The country districts do not appear to have been affected\r\nto any extent,--a fact which shows how much purity of the air has to do\r\nwith the outbreak of epidemic diseases.\r\n\r\nInfluenza, it has been observed, is often associated with other\r\nepidemics: it preceded and accompanied the plague or ‘black death’ in\r\nthe fourteenth century; it preceded the great plague in London, A.D.\r\n1665; it followed epidemic typhus A.D. 1803; preceded typhus A.D. 1837,\r\nand occurred in the midst of the typhoid epidemic in the year 1847.\r\nInfluenza also preceded and followed epidemic cholera, 1831 to 1833. In\r\nshort, it may be said that influenza has from time immemorial pretty\r\ngenerally preceded and accompanied epidemic pestilence in every quarter\r\nof the globe, as is noted by the Registrar-General to have been the\r\ncase in England, A.D. 1728, 1733, 1743, 1758, 1762; five years after,\r\nA.D. 1767, 1775, 1782; again, A.D. 1788, A.D. 1803, 1831, 1832, and\r\nfollowing year, 1833, as also A.D. 1846 and 1847.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n              NATURE AND CAUSES OF EPIDEMIC PESTILENCES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have abundant reason for the belief that nothing is fortuitous; but,\r\non the contrary, that everything in this world of ours is the effect\r\nof design; all things around us bearing evident stamp of the skill and\r\nbeneficence of its Omnipotent Author.\r\n\r\n    “Thus at thy potent nod, EFFECT and CAUSE\r\n    Walk hand in hand accordant to thy Laws;\r\n    Rise at Volition’s call; in groups combined,\r\n    Amuse, delight, instruct, and serve mankind.”\r\n\r\nThe histories of epidemic pestilences or diseases--because of the vast\r\nnumbers of persons on whom they seize at one and the same time, and\r\nalso because of their intensity and destructiveness,--are not only of\r\ngreater importance to mankind than are the generality of maladies,\r\nbut they are also of deep interest in as far as concerns questions of\r\npathology. Epidemics are also exceedingly interesting in a physical and\r\nmoral point of view,--their histories, and the investigation of their\r\ncauses, leading to an insight into the organism of the world, in which\r\nthe sum of organic life is subjected to the greater powers of nature;\r\nfor it would appear, as far as human knowledge extends, that all\r\norganized bodies, from a variety of causes as dissimilar as they are\r\ncomplicated and numerous, are more or less susceptible of change and\r\ndecay. Thus we see disease assail and carry off mankind at all times\r\nand in all regions: murrain is destructive of dumb animals, while\r\nblight spares not the vegetable kingdom, from the sturdiest oak to the\r\nmost diminutive herbage; in fine, all nature is subjected, in various\r\ndegrees, to the devastating tendency of the elements in their general\r\nevolutions in the mundane economy, based on immutable laws, arising\r\nfrom original and supreme provision:\r\n\r\n                “Wonder-working hand,\r\n           ---- in majestic silence sways at will\r\n    The mighty movements of unbounded nature.”\r\n\r\nConsidering that epidemic pestilences or diseases have been from time\r\nimmemorial more destructive of mankind than all other maladies, or than\r\neven famine and the sword combined, it is somewhat surprising that a\r\ncomprehensive and efficient investigation of such an important class of\r\ndiseases, founded on enlarged and scientific views, has never yet been\r\nmade,--in fact, has scarcely ever been attempted. Such apathy to minute\r\nenquiry into the nature and causes of epidemics, and the indifference\r\nevinced to every-day occurrences, so much attended to by the ancients,\r\nis culpable in the extreme; for nothing can be more injurious to the\r\ncause of truth, or tend more to retard scientific pursuits, than\r\nsuch disregard of the nature of things, for daily experience alone\r\nis sufficient to show that every effect in the physical world has\r\nan antecedent cause, which is at all times open to experiment and\r\ninvestigation, and which, however obscure at first, may often be\r\nexplained and understood by means of close observation and steady\r\nperseverance in our researches.\r\n\r\nEpidemics are acute diseases which run through their stages with\r\nrapidity, consequently making it absolutely necessary that we should be\r\nprepared not only to relieve those attacked with promptitude, but, if\r\npossible, to prevent others being affected, which can only be done by\r\nattending to the results of an unprejudiced investigation concerning\r\nall that is known of the laws by which they are governed--the causes\r\nwhence they arise, and their mode of extension.\r\n\r\nTo the ancients, who were accurate observers of nature and of nature’s\r\nlaws, we are indebted for much valuable information as regards the\r\nuniversal distempers termed Epidemic Pestilences,[2] and although\r\namongst their writings we may not at first sight recognize many\r\ndiseases according to our modern nomenclature, nevertheless by careful\r\nperusal and investigation we shall be enabled to identify some of them\r\nsufficiently to show the wisdom and the superiority of the arrangements\r\nof our predecessors, when compared with the confusion and worse than\r\nuselessness of many of the nosological distinctions and classifications\r\nmade since the days of Hippocrates, tending, as they do, not only to\r\ndivert us from the true character of disease, but also to mislead us in\r\nour practical views.\r\n\r\nThe records of antiquity show that all kinds of pestilences, including\r\nfebrile diseases, have been known under various appellations from\r\nthe earliest ages of the world. From the beginning of the Jewish\r\nnation,--from the first settlement of the Israelites in unhealthy Egypt\r\nto the present day, we find noticed a series of plagues or pestilences\r\noverspreading the various parts of the habitable globe, and destroying\r\nmillions of the human species; and if we refer to the histories of\r\nancient nations, as well as to the modern annals of medicine, we shall\r\nfind therein recorded the same character of diseases, arising from\r\nlike causes, occurring during similar seasons, happening in similar\r\nlocalities, and marked pretty generally by the same circumstances.\r\nThe assumption, therefore, of the existence of any new disease, as\r\npropounded by some modern authorities, would represent the Divine Power\r\nas dispensing with the laws of nature,--in short, would imply nothing\r\nless than the suspension or alteration of the operation of those laws\r\nwhich the Almighty in his wisdom imposed on nature at the creation;\r\n\r\n    “By whose almighty word\r\n      They all from nothing came;\r\n    And all shall last\r\n      From changes free;\r\n      His firm decree\r\n    Stands ever fast;”--\r\n\r\n--laws which the pious Psalmist of Israel in his contemplations on the\r\ndivine goodness and greatness of Jehovah, as displayed in the kingdom\r\nof Nature, describes as the admirable chain of natural causes and\r\neffects formed and preserved by him in this lower world:--whatsoever\r\nthe Lord pleaseth, He doeth in heaven and in the earth, in the sea,\r\nand in all deep places. He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends\r\nof the earth, He maketh the lightnings for the rains, He bringeth the\r\nwind out of his treasure, He smote the first-born of Egypt from man to\r\nbeast, He covereth the heaven with clouds, He prepareth the rain for\r\nthe earth, &c.--The supposition of the existence of any new disease\r\nin our day is consequently untenable, but to be accounted for because\r\nof our inability to trace diseases under the same names and precise\r\ncharacteristic symptoms described by our predecessors in the study of\r\nnature; in fact, the comparatively modern origin of some diseases may\r\nbe said to rest on the absence or deficiency of distinct and express\r\nnotice of them in the writings of the ancients, arising in some measure\r\nfrom false or imperfect translations from the original, and from the\r\npractice of the ancients in referring different malignant maladies to\r\nthe same pestilential constitution; for be it remembered that they\r\nconsidered all febrile diseases bore such affinity to each other, that\r\nthey classed all pestilential epidemic distempers under one general\r\nhead or term, viz., PESTILENCE, PLAGUE, or FEVER; under the head\r\nof consumption, they noted all chronic diseases; and boils, scabs,\r\npustules, blotches, carbuncles, &c., were included under that of skin\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\nFurther, with reference to modern nomenclature, we now hear pestilence\r\ncalled plague in Egypt, yellow fever in America and elsewhere, bilious\r\nremittent and intermittent, and also yellow fever in the West Indies,\r\nand typhus or nervous fever in Great Britain: we read also of the same\r\nepidemics which the ancients called pimples, pustules, apostemes, and\r\ngangrenous sores, now being called distinct and confluent small-pox,\r\ncarbuncles, &c.: and I repeat that the perusal of ancient writings,\r\nboth sacred and profane, not only affords us ample evidence of the\r\norigin, nature, causes, progress, and violence of such maladies\r\nin the primitive ages of the world, but they also demonstrate the\r\nidentity of ancient pestilence and modern plague,--the resemblance\r\nof ancient and modern fevers,--the similitude of burning boils and\r\nmodern carbuncle,--the like appearance of pustules and small-pox,--all\r\ntending to prove that no _material_ alteration in the nature of\r\nany diseases, or of their causes, has taken place since the first\r\npopulation of the world; AND, ABOVE ALL, THAT THEY DISPLAY THE\r\nPERPETUAL UNIFORMITY OF PROVIDENCE IN THE ENTIRE OPERATIONS OF NATURE’S\r\nWORKS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n                OF THE CAUSES OF EPIDEMIC PESTILENCES.\r\n\r\n       “Docebo causas, quas diligentiâ experientiâque comperi.”\r\n\r\n\r\nExperience has taught us that the phenomena of epidemic pestilences\r\nor diseases are various and dissimilar, observing no regular course\r\nor succession, but commencing and ceasing at periods influenced by\r\ncertain changes of the seasons, and modified by various circumstances,\r\nespecially such as locality and habit of body.\r\n\r\nThe chronicles of all nations are replete with notices respecting\r\nthe remarkable commotions of nature, which have proved from time\r\nto time so inimical both to the animal and the vegetable kingdoms;\r\nand on carefully reviewing the facts detailed in the histories of\r\nepidemic pestilences or diseases, it will be readily perceived that,\r\nduring certain periods or seasons, ELEMENTAL DISTURBANCE has\r\nenveloped, as it were, the entire globe, carrying death and misery into\r\nevery quarter. I am, therefore, of opinion that the grand phenomena of\r\nnature, exhibited in the commotions of our physical world, supply us\r\nwith abundant materials for the explication of all epidemic pestilences\r\nor diseases; that the latter are consequently assignable to natural\r\ncauses, without searching for or hunting after mysterious agencies, to\r\nthe neglect of those which Nature is constantly presenting to our view.\r\n\r\nI am fully aware that ascertaining the causes of maladies of any\r\ndescription is a matter attended with much difficulty, not only from\r\nthe variety and impalpable nature of the causes themselves, but also\r\nfrom the peculiar functions and various idiosyncrasies of the living\r\nsystem on which such causes act; numerous conditions being found\r\ncapable of modifying the effects of a common cause of disease, viz.\r\nthe season of the year, peculiar state of the atmosphere, especially\r\nas regards heat and humidity, circumstances of locality, the different\r\ntemperaments of individuals exposed to their agency, the influence of\r\nprevious ailments,--all these concurring more or less in the production\r\nof diversified forms of disease.\r\n\r\nBy way of illustration and with reference to atmospheric influence--the\r\n_grand exciting_ cause of disease,--every practitioner is familiar\r\nwith certain conditions which are favourable to the production of\r\ncertain disorders, such as common catarrh or cold, and its more\r\naggravated form termed influenza,--hooping-cough, bowel affections,\r\ngastric fevers, &c. The effects of external temperature first produce\r\non the functions of the skin (which connects us with the exterior\r\nworld) an augmentation or diminution of the natural discharges, by\r\nsuddenly changing or disturbing the balance of the circulating fluids\r\nbetween the external and internal parts or surfaces, irrespective\r\nof the perspiratory process, commonly termed sweat, there being\r\ninnumerable chemical agents more poisonous and of greater importance\r\nas to their elimination from the system in the shape of insensible\r\nperspiration. I repeat, that the effects of external temperature, by\r\ncausing a repercussion of the cutaneous exhalations (sensible and\r\ninsensible), so damage the _vitality_ of the system, as to be the\r\n_exciting_ cause of disease; and, although from our imperfect\r\nknowledge, it scarcely admits of investigation, setting aside chemical\r\nresearch, so that we cannot explain or define the precise peculiarity\r\nof each and every condition of the atmosphere favourable to the\r\nproduction of each variety of disorder, the effects of such external\r\ntemperature are, however, not the less certain and obvious to our\r\nsenses. The agencies are all natural, comprised in the excess of state\r\nor change acting on individuals whose susceptibility varies greatly\r\nfrom moral as well as from physical _predisposing_ causes; but\r\nour inability to define their peculiar conditions or auræ, as noticed\r\nby Hippocrates, Sydenham, Bacon, and others, no more militates against\r\nour reasoning upon their visible effects, than a knowledge of the\r\ngravitating principle or power is essential to the proof of gravity.\r\n\r\nBut to the subject of the causes,--the exciting and the predisposing\r\nof disease; it should be premised that when attributing epidemic\r\npestilences or diseases to natural causes, it must not be supposed or\r\ninferred that any one of such causes, as heat, cold, moisture, drought,\r\n&c., will alone be sufficient to induce disease: to effect that, there\r\nmust be a combination of these causes in continuance and succession, in\r\noccasion and variation, as also in circumstance and virulence.\r\n\r\nIt has always appeared to me that a proper and sufficient distinction\r\nis never, or rather, has never, been made, between the predisposing and\r\nthe exciting causes of disease--an error which leads to much confusion\r\nand to contradictory conclusions on all sides. _Par exemple_,\r\nin a Report on the epidemic pestilence which raged some years ago in\r\nIreland, it was unanimously determined, (so says the Report,) “that the\r\npredisposing causes were, rapid atmospherical vicissitude, low marsh\r\nand other effluvia.” Here we have the exciting cause, ‘atmospheric\r\nvicissitude,’ jumbled together with a predisposing cause, ‘marsh\r\neffluvia;’ while on the other hand, in recent Reports on cholera from\r\nvarious authorities, we have marsh and other effluvia assigned as the\r\nexciting causes, which, on reflection, will strike any one as being\r\nobviously fallacious, inasmuch as if marsh and other effluvia are to\r\nbe considered as exciting causes, instead of predisposing to disease,\r\nwe should scarcely ever find those places free from pestilence where\r\nthese matters are supposed to be engendered, whereas we see various\r\nlocalities in South America,--in British Guiana, for instance, and even\r\nin Ethiopia,--which have been condemned as the hot-bed and nursery of\r\npestilence, where putrefaction is supposed to concoct and concentrate\r\nits most lethal poisons,--still enjoy their seasons of salubrity: it\r\nis, I repeat, from the absence of such distinctions as to the exciting\r\nand the predisposing causes, coupled with the non-consideration of\r\nthe great variety of circumstances, both past and present, local and\r\ngeneral, individual and common, which are influential in the production\r\nof disease, that so much uncertainty and disputation as to the causes\r\nof epidemic pestilences have arisen. Such distinctions will appear to\r\nbe more important and necessary for the prevention and mitigation of\r\nepidemic pestilence or disease, when properly considered, inasmuch as\r\nthe predisposing causes, which are in a great degree under our control,\r\nare always in existence or operation to a greater or less extent, while\r\nthe exciting causes may be said to be of only occasional occurrence.\r\n\r\nAs before observed, the causes of diseases are described as the\r\npredisposing and the exciting. The former, the predisposing causes,\r\nI understand to be,--the want of light; impure air (especially\r\nfrom defective ventilation), in which are included malaria and all\r\nother noxious vapours, from whatever source arising; a scanty and\r\nimpoverishing diet; and, though last, not least, habit of body, induced\r\nby the irregular and artificial life of man in a state of civilization,\r\nwhich, by enervating the system, induces the predisposition to disease\r\nby rendering the human frame more susceptible to external impressions;\r\nthe grand excitants of disease, such as elemental disturbance,\r\nconsisting of variations of temperature and the state of the\r\nsurrounding medium, as to hygrometric influence, electrical tension, &c.\r\n\r\nNaturalists in all ages have concurred in the opinion that sudden\r\natmospheric mutations act injuriously on the subjects of the vegetable\r\nkingdom as well as on those of the animal, and it will, I presume, be\r\nadmitted that the existence of the vegetable kingdom is necessary for\r\nthe support of the animal,--the physiology of both reflecting much\r\nlight on each other. We see the vegetable kingdom assailed by disease\r\ntermed _blight_,--‘pestiferous blight,’ as it has been called\r\nby some; these blights are but pestilences affecting the vegetable\r\nkingdom, and have ever been attributed to natural causes, elemental\r\ndisturbance, &c.\r\n\r\nAt the periods which have been remarkable for the occurrence of\r\nblights, animals--such as horned cattle--have been known to suffer\r\nsooner or later; and man also, as I shall in the course of these\r\npages fully show. Reasoning analogically, therefore, may we not\r\nconclude that that state or condition of the elements which induces\r\nblights,--pestilences in the vegetable,--will also act injuriously on\r\nthe animal kingdom, more especially on the human race, men being, from\r\nhabit of body, &c., more prone to or susceptible of disease?\r\n\r\nReferring to the annals of history, which so abundantly show that\r\nthe ancients considered all universal distempers as originating in\r\nthe disturbed states of the seasons, I will cite a few instances\r\n(commencing with sacred history) explanatory of the causes of universal\r\nmaladies, termed epidemic pestilences or diseases.\r\n\r\nIn the books of the Old and New Testaments we find beautifully\r\ndescribed the great causes of pestilence inducing their effects in\r\nregular succession and with absolute certainty. The books of God, in\r\ntracing the hand of Omnipotence through the medium of secondary causes,\r\nproducing effects punitive of guilty mortals, attribute all diseases to\r\nthe immediate interposition of Divine Providence:\r\n\r\n   “Pestis et ira Deûm Stygiis sese extulit undis.”\r\n\r\nAnd why?--Because God is the first great cause, the original creator of\r\nall things, the preserver and governor of all things in heaven and on\r\nthe earth, and likewise the sole disposer of the elements.\r\n\r\nSeeing, therefore, that our Creator, while possessing the sovereignty\r\nof the universe, may employ what agents he pleases for the execution\r\nof his purposes, we, in investigating the causes of all distempers,\r\nwithout in the slightest degree impugning their divine origin, can\r\nperceive that the Almighty Disposer of events effected his purposes by\r\nthe employment of natural means;--further, in expounding the causes of\r\ndisease, as existing in natural and common things, and modification of\r\nbeings and things of this natural world, we can do equal homage to the\r\nAlmighty’s wisdom and goodness, omnipotence, justice, mercy, judgment,\r\nand providence, as we can in displaying them as immediately inflicted\r\non guilty man. Yea, more glorious do the attributes of the Most High\r\nappear in the sublime mysteries of nature!\r\n\r\nTo particularize: when the governors of the five cities, Gath, Ekron,\r\nAskelon, Gaza, and Ashdod, met for the purpose of contriving to rid\r\nthemselves of the ark which the Philistines had captured from the\r\nHebrews, it would appear that they were cognizant of the natural means\r\nadopted by the Almighty to effect his purposes, although they, in their\r\nimpiety, doubted the divine origin of their affliction by pestilence.\r\nOverlooking the omnipotence and all-wise direction of their Creator,\r\nthey exhorted the people to bear patiently that which had befallen\r\nthem, and to believe in no other causes of the pestilence which was\r\neffecting their destruction _than those springing from the operations\r\nof nature, which at certain revolutions of time produce such mutations\r\nin the bodies of men, in the earth, in plants, and in all things grown\r\nout of the earth, as to excite disease_.\r\n\r\nWith reference to elemental disturbance, the prophet Amos (ch. iv.\r\nvss. 8 and 9) first describes the occurrence of a great drought,\r\nthen the generation of insects--the palmer-worm and the canker-worm,\r\nwhich destroyed all foliage and herbage: vegetables, orchards, and\r\nolive-yards, all fell a sacrifice, and induced a grievous famine,\r\nsucceeded by a dire pestilence.\r\n\r\nHabakkuk, in his prayer, (chap. iii.) makes allusion to a great\r\npestilence preceded by earthquakes and great commotions of the\r\nelements; the sun and moon standing still in their habitations, the\r\nmountains trembling, and the waters overflowing, causing famine and\r\npestilence, to the destruction of 14,000 persons.\r\n\r\nAgain, in the 28th chapter of Deuteronomy, which contains the promised\r\ncursings and blessings of the Almighty on his people, we have a\r\nproverbial figure of speech, _expressively_ illustrative of the\r\nnatural means employed by our Creator in effecting his purposes: “And\r\nthy heaven shall be brass, and the earth iron;” the one denoting a\r\ndrought, during which the heavens will yield no rain, inferring also\r\nextreme heat; the other, the unproductiveness of the earth, yielding\r\nno fruit,--the effects of such drought being to induce famine, and\r\nultimately disease. The experience of our own times exemplifies in the\r\nfullest manner the concurrence, from _physical causes_, of famine\r\nwith pestilence--facts which the prophets of old always connected,\r\nviz., the sword, famine, and pestilence, as being three evils which\r\ngenerally accompanied or followed each other; and we cannot conceive\r\na doubt as to the association not being accidental, especially of the\r\ntwo latter, but arising from their dependence upon similar atmospheric\r\nphenomena.\r\n\r\nJeremiah (chap, iv., vss. 11 and 13), in describing the approach\r\nof the armies of Babylon, compares them to the drying, parching,\r\nscorching, and blasting winds of Egypt, Africa, Arabia, and Asia, which\r\nwither and destroy the fruit of the earth, melting and oppressing all\r\nliving creatures; and he likens them to clouds of dust and whirlwinds\r\ntraversing those pestiferous countries of the East, where the heat\r\nand drought, the dews and damps, heavy rains, the cold north winds of\r\nwinter and spring, succeeded by the suffocating heats of summer and\r\nautumn, generate pestilence and cutaneous diseases.\r\n\r\nIn turning to the history of Egypt,--to this day a hot-bed of\r\npestilence,--we have graphically pictured a series of events occurring\r\nand ending in the production of pestilential disease. The waters of the\r\nrivers were first turned red, the fish died, and stank therein, causing\r\nputrefaction of their bodies, while the waters became unfit for use,\r\neither by men or beasts: secondly, swarms of frogs infected the land,\r\npenetrating into the very houses; these were succeeded by a host of\r\ninsects, lice, flies, &c.: thirdly, the beasts of the field suffered\r\nfrom murrain; and finally, man suffered from boils, blains, &c. If we\r\nlook into the topography of Egypt, we shall find abundant causes to\r\naccount for its great and continued insalubrity;--the whole country\r\nlies near the tropic of Cancer; it is bounded towards the east by the\r\nRed Sea, on the west by the deserts of Libya, on the north by the\r\nMediterranean, and on the south by Abyssinia or Upper Ethiopia. All the\r\nlower country is encompassed by the arms of the Nile, and is inundated\r\nannually by that father of rivers, when it overflows: it rises\r\ntwenty-four feet in perpendicular height at the medium increase of four\r\ninches daily, and it continues from the end of June to the beginning\r\nof September, when it begins gradually to subside. The inhabitants sow\r\ntheir corn and vegetables in October and November, immediately after\r\nthe retiring of the waters; their harvest-time is in March and April.\r\nVolney observes that the surface of the land successively assumes the\r\nappearance of an ocean of fresh water, of a miry morass, of a green\r\nlevel plain, and of a parched desert of sand and dust, and all in such\r\nrapid succession that it can never be otherwise than insalubrious.\r\n\r\nTo recapitulate more fully. In that calamitous period in the days\r\nof Moses, as shown in the history of Egypt already alluded to, the\r\nseason was distinguished by an extraordinary phenomenon, the waters\r\nbeing turned to the colour of blood by the addition of some remarkable\r\nmaterials or insects which killed all their fish, and caused the waters\r\nto stink in all the low lands of Egypt, so that they could not drink\r\nthe waters of the river or of their ponds for seven days; this peculiar\r\ncondition of the waters, and the heat of the atmosphere, engendered\r\nswarms of frogs, which, it is stated, came up into their houses, into\r\ntheir very bed-rooms, entered into their ovens, and even into their\r\ndough. Some great commotion of the elements, or a great and sudden\r\nchange of the weather, killed the frogs in their houses, villages, and\r\nfields. When the people gathered their carcases into heaps, so great\r\nwere their numbers that the whole land stank with their putrefying\r\nbodies; lice began afterwards to infect the inhabitants, as well as\r\nthe bodies of domestic animals; swarms of noisome insects, such as\r\nflies, &c., succeeded the general putrefaction of the dead frogs,\r\nand as the excesses of the seasons continued and increased, a mortal\r\npestilence among domestic animals, cattle and horses, camels, oxen and\r\nsheep, ensued. This was the presage to an awful pestilence among men,\r\naccording to the common course of nature; indeed the Egyptians had not\r\nrecovered the loss of their cattle, when fiery pustules, apostemes,\r\nand putrid ulcers infested their own bodies. After this succession of\r\nevils, a dreadful storm of hail arose and destroyed cattle, herbs, and\r\nfruit; in this tremendous tempest, we read that the lightning, mingled\r\nwith hail, ran along the ground, and was so very dismal and grievous in\r\nits appearance and effects, that Pharaoh and all his people trembled as\r\nif the pillars of nature had been shaken to their very foundation, and\r\nthe world was about to come to an end: to add to these dire calamities,\r\nhosts of locusts were brought by the east wind over all the land of\r\nEgypt; they rested on all the coasts and borders of the land, covering\r\nthe face of the earth, so that the ground was blackened by them; while\r\nthey devoured the residue of the herbs which the hailstorm had spared,\r\nnot one green thing remaining in the land of Egypt.\r\n\r\nSoon after this, a strong west wind began to blow, which cast all\r\nthe locusts into the Red Sea, where they were drowned; their bodies\r\nbeing subsequently washed on shore, stank intolerably, and became a\r\ngreat auxiliary cause of pestilence amongst the inhabitants. Meantime\r\nthree days of astonishing darkness spread over all the land, and the\r\ninhabitants could not see each other, neither did they rise from\r\ntheir seats; pestilence meanwhile was rife in the land. This terrible\r\ndistemper first seized all the young and robust, all the first-born\r\nof man and beast--from the first-born of the king to that of the\r\nslave,--yea, there was not a house in which there were not some dead;\r\nso tremendous was the stroke that the sacred historian calls it the\r\nimmediate judgment of God to punish their wickedness. And behold it\r\nhappened in the dead of the night, says the devout narrator, that the\r\nLord smote all the first-born of Egypt, from the first-born of Pharaoh\r\nthat sat on the throne to the first-born of the maid-servant that\r\nstands behind the mill, and even the firstlings of the beasts;--in\r\nshort, so dreadful was the calamity and destruction that the Egyptians\r\ncried out, “We be all dead men!”\r\n\r\nLooking to all the foregoing circumstances detailed, can we hesitate\r\nto attribute the terrible malady which prevailed in Egypt to any but\r\nthe pestilential constitution of the season?--can we suppose the\r\noperation of any other than natural causes, such as long drought,\r\nexcessive heats, hot burning winds, clouds of suffocating dust and\r\nsand; heavy rains succeeding the drought; storms of hail mingled with\r\nlightning; famine, the consequence of the destruction produced by the\r\nlocusts and devouring insects; the noxious emanations from dead frogs\r\nwhich had been destroyed by the dismal commotions of the elements; and\r\nthe insufferable stench arising from the carcases of the quantity of\r\ndead animals? Can we imagine, I ask, any other causes to have been in\r\nexistence to produce such awful pestilence than those of the sudden\r\ngreat changes of the weather, inundations of the rivers, and the\r\nuniversal corruption of dead animal and vegetable matter throughout the\r\ndominion of Egypt? I reiterate the question,--have we not abundance of\r\nmaterial to account for this terrible infliction on the people of Egypt?\r\n\r\nAbout this period of dire suffering of the Egyptians from pestilence,\r\nthe first dreadful epoch of Spanish epidemiology is recorded as having\r\ncommenced; the date, however, has been variously given. By some writers\r\nit is fixed about the time of David, 1017 B.C., when 70,000\r\npersons were destroyed in three days by pestilence; by other writers\r\nit is stated to have commenced amongst the Spanish 1100 B.C.\r\nThere were _twenty-five_ years of drought in Spain without\r\ninterruption; springs were dried up; rivers became fordable, their\r\nwaters being almost stagnant; there was neither pasture for beasts, nor\r\nfruit for man; so great was the barrenness of the land, that there was\r\nscarcely anything green to be found, except some few olive-trees on the\r\nbanks of the Ebro and the Guadalquivir: such, says the historian, was\r\nthe melancholy state of ancient Spain, “full of dreadful mortalities,\r\nplagues, and miseries of every description, which, with emigration to\r\nother lands, nearly depopulated our country.”\r\n\r\nThe Greek poet, Homer, describes the causes of the pestilence which\r\nattacked the armies at the siege of Troy as being attributable to the\r\nextreme heat of the weather and the unfriendly seasons. He styles the\r\nsun Apollo:\r\n\r\n    “On mules and dogs th’ infection first began,\r\n    And last the vengeful arrows fix’d on man;\r\n    But let some prophet or some sacred sage\r\n    Explore the cause of Great Apollo’s rage.”\r\n\r\nThucydides, another celebrated Greek historian, describes a similar\r\ncondition of the atmosphere with physical irregularities, as causing an\r\nawful pestilence at Athens:\r\n\r\n   τεκμήριον δὲ τῶν μὲν τοιούτων ὀρνίθων ἐπίλειψις σαφὴς ἐγένετο,\r\n   καὶ οὐχ ἑωρῶντο οὔτε ἄλλως οὔτε περὶ τοιοῦτον οὐδέν· οἱ δὲ κύνες\r\n   μᾶλλον αἴσθησιν παρεῖχον τοῦ ἀποβαίνοντος διὰ τὸ ξυνδιαιτᾶσθαι.\r\n\r\nLucretius, in imitating Thucydides, thus expresses himself:\r\n\r\n    “Nec tamen omnino temere illis solibus ulla\r\n    Comparebat avis, nec noctibus secla ferarum\r\n    Exibant sylvis; languebant pleraque morbo\r\n    Et moriebantur; cum primis fida canum vis\r\n    Strata viis animam ponebat in omnibus ægram;\r\n    Extorquebat enim vitam vis morbida membris.”\r\n\r\n    “No longer birds at noon, nor beasts at night,\r\n    Their native woods deserted; with the pest\r\n    Remote they languish’d and full frequent died;\r\n    But chief the dog his generous strength resign’d,\r\n    Tainting the highways, while the ruthless bane\r\n    Through every limb his sickening spirit drove.”\r\n\r\nThe poet Ovid, in the seventh book of his Metamorphoses, in describing\r\nthe terrible pestilence which occurred in the island of Egina (see\r\n‘History of Pestilences’), represents the pestilence as arising from\r\nthe following causes:--He exhibits the earth covered with dense clouds,\r\ndarkness, and suffocating heat; the deadly south winds blowing for four\r\nmonths, the very vapours of disease; the lakes and fountains infected,\r\nthe air poisoned, and the entire land infested with venomous serpents,\r\nas happened to the people of old. The plague or pestilence first\r\nattacked horses, oxen, mules, sheep, dogs, cats, and even birds, and\r\nthen it affected mankind; death was sudden, and the streets were choked\r\nwith the carcases of men and beasts, and universal nature seemed to be\r\nsuffering from premature caducity.\r\n\r\nIn order to show the identity of this pestilence with the plague of\r\nEgypt, the bilious remittent or yellow pestilence of the West Indies\r\nand the United States, the disease termed Andalusian fever which has\r\nfrom the earliest ages made such havoc in Spain and the adjoining\r\ncountry, and also with the pestilence which has more than once\r\nvisited both England and Ireland in days of yore, we have collected\r\nthe symptoms of that disease from Ovid’s poetical enumeration of the\r\nmorbid phenomena, which were,--great heat in the bowels, flushings\r\nof the face, difficulty of breathing, bilious vomiting, pains in the\r\nhead, with obstinate constipation, great prostration of strength,\r\nunquenchable thirst, delirium, often attended with coma, great anguish,\r\ndry black tongue, cough, &c., which proceeded to a fatal termination in\r\nthe course of two, three, or four days: the following is a translation\r\nor imitation of the original.\r\n\r\n    “A dreadful plague from angry Juno came,\r\n    To scourge the land that bore her rival’s name,\r\n    Before her fatal anger was reveal’d,\r\n    And teeming malice lay as yet conceal’d.\r\n    At first we only felt th’ oppressive weight\r\n    Of gloomy clouds, then teeming with our fate,\r\n    And labouring to discharge the sultry heat:\r\n    But ere four moons alternate changes knew,\r\n    With deadly blasts the fatal south wind blew,\r\n    Infected all the air, and poison’d as it flew.\r\n    Our mountains, too, a dire infection yield,\r\n    For crowds of vipers creep along the field,\r\n    And with polluted gore and baneful teems\r\n    Taint all the lakes and venom all the streams.\r\n    The young disease with milder rage began,\r\n    Seized on birds and beasts, approaching man;\r\n    The labouring oxen fall before the plough--\r\n    The ploughmen wonder, stare, can’t imagine how;\r\n    The tabid sheep, with sickly bleatings pine,\r\n    Their wool decreasing as their strength decline;\r\n    The warlike steeds, by inward foes compell’d,\r\n    Neglect their honours and desert the field;\r\n    Enerved and languid, seek a base retreat,\r\n    And at the mangers groan, but wish’d a nobler fate.\r\n    The stags forget their speed, the boars their rage,\r\n    Nor can the bears the stronger herds engage:\r\n    A common faintness now invades them all,\r\n    In woods and fields promiscuously they fall.\r\n    The air exhales the stench, and, strange to say,\r\n    The ravenous birds and beasts avoid the prey;\r\n    The putrid bodies rot upon the ground,\r\n    And spread the dire contagion all around.\r\n    Meanwhile the plague acquires a larger size,\r\n    It feasts on men, and scorns a meaner prize.\r\n    Intestine heats begin the civil war,\r\n    And flushings first the latent flame declare,\r\n    And fiery breath, which seem’d like burning air.\r\n    Their black dry tongues are swell’d and scarcely move,\r\n    And short thick sighs from panting lungs evolve:\r\n    They gasp for air, with vainest hopes to sate\r\n    Their raging flames, but that augments their heat.\r\n    No bed, no covering, can the sicken’d bear--\r\n    All on the ground exposed to open air,\r\n    They lie, and hope to find a pleasing coolness there.\r\n    The burning earth, with hot oppression curst,\r\n    Returns the heat which they imparted first.\r\n    All remedies they try, all med’cines use,\r\n    Which nature could supply or art produce:\r\n    Invincible, it mocks the vain design,\r\n    And art and nature foil’d--declare the cause divine.”\r\n\r\nHippocrates, the great founder and parent of rational medicine, in his\r\nbook on Epidemic Distempers, accurately delineates the vicissitudes of\r\nthe weather and the different seasons of the year, attributing to them\r\nthe causes of all diseases. He thus describes a state of atmosphere\r\nproducing a most extraordinarily dismal pestilence and mortality: A\r\nseason marked by abundant showers, a south wind following drought; a\r\nhot and sultry autumn, with abundant rain; a humid, open, light, and\r\nwarm winter, extremes of cold after the conversion of the sun under\r\nthe equinox, with winds blowing, with snow and sudden great change of\r\nweather.\r\n\r\n“Annus austrinus, imbribus abundans atque in totum ventis tranquillus\r\nfuit. Quum autem paulo superioribus anni temporibus justo majores\r\nsiccitates viguissent, sub Arcturum sperantibus austris multum fuit.\r\nAutumnus obscurus, nebulosus, cum aquarum abundantiâ, hyems austrina\r\nhumida et levis. Longo vero post solis conversionem intervallo juxta\r\nÆquinoctium, extremæ hyemes adfuerunt; jamque sub Æquinoctium ipsum\r\nAquilonares venti cum nivibus non ita diu speravere. Ver rursus\r\naustrinum a flatibus quietum, aquæ multæ et continentes ad canem\r\nusque. Æstas verum calida, æstus præfocantes magna. Anniversarii venti\r\n(Etesias vocant) pauci disjunctim speravere. Sub Arcturum rursus\r\nspirantibus aquilonibus aquæ multæ.”--(On Epidemics, bk. iii. sect. 3.)\r\n\r\nAgain, in section 8 and 18 we have: “In aëre considerandum quanta insit\r\ncaliditas, frigiditas, crassitudo, tenuitas, siccitas, humiditas an\r\nplenior an vero minor et copiosior. In quibus quænam mutationes et ex\r\nquibus fiunt, quomodoque se habeant, animadvertere oportet,”--plainly\r\nsignifying that a pestilential constitution of the seasons consists of\r\natmospheric vicissitudes, heat and cold, dryness and moisture out of\r\nseason and in excess.\r\n\r\nGalen, the great commentator on the works of his master, assigns two\r\ncauses to pestilence; the one, a great irregularity of the seasons, and\r\nconsequently a pestilential state of the air; the other, a vitiated\r\ncondition of the human body from corrupt and defective food, impure\r\nair, &c., by which means it is rendered liable to disease: here we have\r\nthe exciting and the predisposing causes of disease clearly pointed\r\nout.\r\n\r\nFurther, in illustration of continued drought inducing famine with its\r\nother evils, disease and mortality, we may quote Tasso’s beautiful\r\ndescription of the sufferings of the Christian army under the walls of\r\nJerusalem:\r\n\r\n    “The leaves grew wan, upon the wither’d sprays\r\n    The grass and growing herb all parched were;\r\n    Earth cleft in rifts, in floods each stream decay,\r\n    And barren clouds with lightning bright appear.\r\n    Still was the air, the rack nor came nor went,\r\n    But o’er the land, with lukewarm breathing flies\r\n    The southern wind, from sun-burnt Afric sent,\r\n    Which thick and warm, his interrupted blast,\r\n    Upon their bosoms, throats, and faces cast.\r\n\r\n    Nor yet more comfort brought the gloomy night;\r\n    In her thick shades was burning heat up roll’d,\r\n    Her sable mantle was embroider’d bright,\r\n    With blazing stars and gliding fires for gold.\r\n    Nor to refresh (sad earth’s) thy thirsty sprite\r\n    The niggard Moon let fall her May-dews cold,\r\n    And dried up the vital moisture was\r\n    In trees, in plants, in herbs, in flowers, in grass.\r\n\r\n    And little Silve, that his store bestows\r\n    Of purest crystal on the Christian hands,\r\n    The pebbles naked in his channel shows,\r\n    And scanty glides above the scorched sands.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    The sturdy bodies of the warriors strong,\r\n    Whom neither marching far, nor tedious way,\r\n    Nor weighty arms which on their shoulders hung,\r\n    Could weary make, nor death itself dismay,\r\n    Now weak and feeble cast their limbs along,\r\n    Unwieldy burthens on the burning clay;\r\n    And in each vein a smouldering fire there dwelt,\r\n    Which dried their flesh, and solid bones did melt.\r\n\r\n    Languish’d the steed, late fierce, and proffer’d grass\r\n    His fodder erst despised and from him kest;\r\n    Each step he stumbled, and which lofty was\r\n    And high advanced before now fell his crest;\r\n    His conquest gotten, all forgotten pass,\r\n    Nor with desire of glory swell’d his breast;\r\n    The spoils won from his foe, his late rewards,\r\n    He now neglects, despises, nought regards.\r\n\r\n    Languish’d the faithful dog, and wonted care\r\n    Of his dear lord and cabin both forgot;\r\n    Panting he laid, and gather’d fresher air\r\n    To cool the burning in his entrails hot;\r\n    But breathing (which wise nature did prepare\r\n    To ‘suage the stomach’s heat) now booted not,\r\n    For little ease, (alas!) small help they win,\r\n    That breathe forth air, and scalding fire suck in.”\r\n\r\nThe learned prelate Eusebius gives a very philosophical description\r\nof the impure state of the atmosphere during a great pestilence which\r\nravaged the Roman empire. He writes thus: “The air was so noxious,\r\nevery where deranged with corrupt vapours, fumes from the earth so\r\nputrid, winds from the sea, exhalations from marshes and rivers so\r\ninjurious, that a certain poisonous liquor, as it were from putrid\r\ncarcases, was brought by the elements, and covered the subjacent seats\r\nor benches, walls, and sides of houses, and the dew appeared like the\r\nsanies of dead bodies.” (See edit. Paris. 1628.)\r\n\r\nTacitus, in his description of Rome, notes the occurrence, every third\r\nor fourth year, of what they termed “tempus grave aut annus pestilens,”\r\nand he gives the following tetrastichon--\r\n\r\n    “Rome voracious of men subdues the lofty necks of heroes;\r\n    Rome full of fevers is frightful with the seeds of death;\r\n    Roman fevers are faithful by their lasting course,\r\n    When they once invade, seldom quit the living man.”\r\n\r\nIf the site of Rome with its other concomitants be considered, we shall\r\nreadily understand why pestilences were there so rife. It is situated\r\nin a level country on the low banks of the Tiber, surrounded by the\r\nextensive Ostiensian and Pontine marshes, exposed to the powerful\r\nrays of the sun, and subject to inundations and other commotions of\r\nthe elements; further the inhabitants having been constantly engaged\r\nin war, did not cultivate their lands sufficiently to produce food\r\nfor half the population, nor had they any established commercial\r\nintercourse with other countries, from which they could be supplied in\r\ntimes of scarcity. From their perpetual inroads agriculture was also\r\ninterrupted among all the adjoining nations, and the far-famed Romans\r\nwere often reduced to the necessity of feeding upon grass, leaves,\r\nand unwholesome roots, or of consuming the provender stored for their\r\ncattle, till men and beasts, and, it is said, birds and fish, perished\r\ntogether, so pestilential were the seasons; “vulgato per omne genus\r\nanimalium morbo.”\r\n\r\nI might go on multiplying authorities _ad infinitum_ to show\r\nthat previously to the middle of the seventeenth century those ages\r\nwere full of physical and political miseries, sufficient to account\r\nfor the frequent outbreak of fatal maladies; and we shall also find\r\nthat subsequently to that period all those countries that have\r\nadopted judicious regulations in the construction of their dwellings,\r\nin widening their streets, improving the drainage, and securing an\r\nadequate supply of the three grand essentials to vitality,--light, air,\r\nand water, have proportionately experienced a corresponding immunity\r\nfrom pestilence, a notable exemplification of which we have in this\r\nour own country, although we are far, very far, in this the nineteenth\r\ncentury, from the improved condition that our wealth and the repeated\r\nwarnings of disease which have been vouchsafed us, especially since the\r\nyear 1832,--now nearly twenty years,--should have given rise to.\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, until after the great fire in 1666, at the\r\nrebuilding of London, as it were, that any measures were taken to\r\nsecure the public health. In the year 1665, during the time of the\r\ngreat and terrible plague, our streets were narrow, and the houses,\r\nwhich were built of wood, closed inwards towards each other, one\r\nstory projecting considerably above the other, till they seemed\r\nalmost to touch each other at the top, and looking upwards from the\r\nstreet towards the sky was very like looking up from the bottom of a\r\nwell. There were scarcely any sewers; the streets were damp and wet,\r\nand nearly everything in the shape of offal was thrown into them,\r\nwhile certain corporate bodies, the ecclesiastical authorities even,\r\ncontended stoutly for the right of sending their swine into the\r\nstreets to feed upon such garbage as they found plentifully therein.\r\nIt would also appear that the general habits of the citizens in no way\r\ncounteracted the bad effects of their faulty architecture by domestic\r\ncleanliness.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated Erasmus asserts that the interior of the dwellings in\r\nLondon was disgusting to the last degree. He plainly ascribed ‘the\r\nsweating sickness,’ which was a species of plague, to the incommodious\r\nform and bad position of the houses, the filthiness of the streets, and\r\nthe sluttishness within doors. In a letter to a physician of Cardinal\r\nWolsey’s, in which he gives an account of the domestic habits of our\r\ncountrymen in those days, he says, “There is a degree of uncleanliness,\r\nand even of filth, pourtrayed, of which we can have no conception in\r\nour times.” He continues: “The floors are commonly of clay, strewed\r\nwith rushes, which were occasionally removed, but underneath lies\r\nunmolested an ancient collection of beer, grease, fragments of fish,\r\nspittle, the excrements of dogs, cats, and everything that was nasty.”\r\nHentzer observes, that even the floor of the presence-chamber of the\r\nQueen Elizabeth, in Greenwich Palace, “was covered with hay after the\r\nEnglish fashion;” and Hume remarks, as a proof of the meanness of\r\nliving in those days, “that the comptroller of the household of Edward\r\nthe Sixth paid only 30s. a year for his house in Channel Row, which\r\nlike the generality of the streets of London was unpaved and undrained,\r\nand contained an accumulation of the offal and such filth as was\r\nhabitually thrown into them.”\r\n\r\nSydenham, who writes of the changes produced in the amount of disease\r\naccording to locality, the constitutions of the seasons, &c., notices\r\nthat London in his day was ill-built, ill-drained, ill-supplied with\r\nwater, and the neighbouring country to the very suburbs so badly\r\ncleared, as to subject the inhabitants to a return of agues regularly\r\nin spring and autumn; and in the journal of De Foe we have assigned\r\nas one of the many causes of the pestilence that occurred in this\r\ncountry in 1665, the crowded state of the city and suburbs, which were\r\nprodigiously full in consequence of the disbanding of the armies after\r\nthe restoration of the royal family and of the monarchy. Our city, says\r\nDe Foe, was computed to have had in it 100,000 inhabitants _more_\r\nthan it ever entertained before; some computed the number as being\r\ntwice as many, so that pestilence became in one year (1665) more\r\nterribly destructive from the immense numbers crowded together, aided\r\nby peculiar elemental disturbances, which had been rife for several\r\nyears previously; pestilence indeed may be said to have existed in\r\nLondon continuously from the year 1661 unto 1666.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1665 the terrible plague became aggravated in the month\r\nof July, from the sultriness of the atmosphere, cold nocturnal dews\r\nor damp fogs, frequent cold showers and cold winds alternating with\r\nthe warmth and dryness of the air; in short, every extreme vicissitude\r\nseemed to exist in that dismal period of disease and death, producing\r\nagues, bilious disorders, bowel complaints, &c. In the next month the\r\ngreat general pestilence appeared to swallow up as it were all previous\r\ndiseases in one common destruction. Indeed, from the month of August\r\nall other diseases were absorbed in the pestilence: all distempers,\r\ncommencing in their usual form, were uniformly resolved into the deadly\r\nplague; and in the month of September, says the great historian,\r\n“Death rode triumphant among the devoted inhabitants of London; having\r\nborrowed the fatal scythe of Time, he mowed down the people like grass,\r\nand immerged the poor remains in horror and despair.”\r\n\r\nHaving advanced thus much in support of the natural causes of universal\r\ndistempers or epidemic pestilences, culled from the histories of\r\npestilences from the earliest ages, we arrive at the consideration of\r\nthat ‘vexata quæstio,’--contagion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n                             OF CONTAGION.\r\n\r\n\r\nContention on such a subject as contagion is not to be wondered at,\r\nwhen we consider the obscurity attendant on all that relates to subtle\r\nagencies (the supposed qualities of contagion); and inasmuch as we\r\nobserve that different effects arise from the same causes, as also\r\nsimilar effects from different causes in the human body, a vast field\r\nis necessarily opened up for contention, as every impartial observer\r\nwill admit.\r\n\r\nThat the doctrine of contagion is of comparatively modern origin\r\n(subsequently to Hippocrates), historical research fully shows, and it\r\nwould be really an endless, if not an unprofitable, task to review the\r\ninnumerable arguments of which contagionists and their opponents have\r\nfrom time to time availed themselves in support of their respective\r\nopinions, especially when the controversialists can enlist on the one\r\nside such names as Chisholm, Clark, Cleghorn, Pringle, Bianchi, Lind,\r\nMeade, Warren, and a host of others, as contagionists, and on the other\r\nside, as non-contagionists, such men as Hillary, Huck, Hunter, Jackson,\r\nBouland, Pinckard, Bancroft, Scott, Rush, Miller, Caldwell, Chervin,\r\nbesides very many others of more modern date.\r\n\r\nWith reference to our present subject, contagion, it has always been\r\nwith me a difficulty to understand the precise or real sense in which\r\ncontagionists generally write; and I must confess my inability to\r\ncomprehend the meaning they attach to the term contagion, and also to\r\nthat of infection, so contradictory are their applications of the terms\r\n_contagion_ and _infection_, some using them synonymously,\r\nothers making distinctions, between contagion and infection, of such\r\narbitrary signification, that they are really neither definite nor\r\nintelligible; whilst contagionists themselves often depart from their\r\n_avowed_ principles. For example, Papôn, in his work entitled\r\n‘Epoques Mémorables de la Peste,’ considers the undoubted causes of\r\nplague to be uncultivated lands, marshy soil, corrupt lakes, filthy\r\ncities, concurring with occasional causes, such as intemperature of\r\nthe seasons and famine, whilst the bent of his researches is evidently\r\nto prove that in every modern plague _foreign_ contagion was the\r\ncause!\r\n\r\nDr. Meade, notwithstanding his advocacy of contagion, like most other\r\ncontagionists, is guilty of inconsistency in stating, “that a corrupt\r\nstate of the air attends all plagues.”\r\n\r\nAgain, Dr. Patrick Russell, a great contagionist, when giving a most\r\nminute account of the origin, spread, and decline of the plague, admits\r\nthe inutility of quarantine laws for the prevention of contagion, and,\r\ncuriously enough, he lays much stress on what he terms “a pestilential\r\nconstitution of the air.”\r\n\r\nDr. Hamilton, another great contagionist, affirmed that the influenza\r\nwhich prevailed in England,--in fact, all over Europe, in the year\r\n1782, was contagious, and that the malady was propagated by contagion\r\nonly; yet at the same time he informs us that, “in different places,\r\nmany hundreds were seized with pestilence at one and the same time:”\r\nand Dr. (afterwards Sir Gilbert) Blane, also a contagionist, speaks\r\nof the influenza as having affected mariners in the very midst of the\r\nocean!\r\n\r\nIt would appear, however, that to reconcile conflicting opinions,\r\nvarious modern writers of experience and talent have endeavoured\r\nto show that epidemic diseases, _not_ contagious at their\r\ncommencement, may acquire that character from confined air, filth, and\r\nother accumulations. That impure air, want of light, crowding together\r\n_unwashed_ numbers, &c., will by predisposition contribute to\r\nthe production and aggravation of disease, as we observe to be the\r\ncase in jails, hospitals, and in camp, I can fully understand; but\r\nthat epidemic diseases, such, for instance, as plague, yellow fever,\r\nor cholera, are ever propagated by contact--contagion, I, after\r\ntwenty-five years’ residence in pestilential countries, have no reason\r\nto believe; for I have seen epidemics seize on vast numbers at once,--I\r\nhave sometimes seen them attack a whole people, or a part thereof,\r\nwhilst at other times they have prevailed amongst the inhabitants of\r\nparticular provinces and cities only. On what principle of contagion\r\nor infection, I would ask, can such universality or partiality of\r\ndisease be accounted for or explained? Surely not from any cognizable\r\nproperty of contagion. All that I have ever read and seen of the nature\r\nof epidemics militates against the doctrine of contagion, whilst all\r\nthat has been adduced, as far as my researches show, in support of\r\ncontagion, has been of a negative, or at all events not of a positive,\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nEpidemic diseases, which have appeared and spread at different\r\nseasons,--in fact, at all times of the year,--in the middle of summer,\r\nfor instance, as well as in the depth of winter,--which have also been\r\nfound traversing whole continents, continuing their course for many\r\nsuccessive months, and often assuming a definite direction or progress,\r\noften affecting large masses of people living on the same spot, while\r\nothers in adjoining localities are exempt,--cannot, I contend, be\r\nattributed to contagion, but to the qualities and influences of the\r\nsurrounding atmosphere, coupled with enervating habits, &c.\r\n\r\nAGAIN, CONTAGIOUS DISEASES ARE RECOGNIZABLE BY THE DETERMINATE\r\nPERIODS OF THEIR PHENOMENA, ESPECIALLY AS REGARDS SPECIFICATION, AS\r\nALSO BY THEIR MODE OF PROPAGATION, WHILST, IF EPIDEMIC PESTILENCES WERE\r\nDEPENDENT ON, OR CAUSED BY, CONTAGION, THEY WOULD NEVER CEASE UNTIL\r\nWHOLE COMMUNITIES BECAME EXTINCT!\r\n\r\nA period of one hundred and sixty years has elapsed (up to the year\r\n1832) since the occurrence of any plague or aggravated pestilence in\r\nthis our own country, notwithstanding our intercourse with countries\r\nwhere awful pestilence may be said always to exist. Whence, then, I\r\nwould ask, our immunity for so long a period, if pestilence BE\r\nIMPORTABLE AND CONTAGIOUS? for it would appear that in spite of\r\nour increased intercourse and commerce with pest-ridden spots, our\r\nfreedom from pestilence has been greater, manifestly from the change in\r\nour moral and physical condition since the seventeenth century, which\r\nhas given rise to a degree of public health to which our ancestors\r\nwere strangers when pestilence was rife in our land, and which is not\r\nattributable, as some may suppose, to the vigilant enforcement of those\r\nbugbears, ‘quarantine laws,’ of which a recent writer very justly\r\nobserves, “that they are not only absurd and needlessly burthensome to\r\ncommerce, but perverse and barbarous in the extreme, independent of\r\nthe injurious fears induced, being as dangerous to communities as they\r\nmilitate against common sense and HUMANITY.”\r\n\r\nWhilst on the subject of quarantine, the question may be asked,--How\r\nis it that so little has been elicited in support of contagion from\r\nthe working of lazarettos?--it being to the interest of those who hold\r\nsuch views to publish THE LETHAL effects of their lazaretto\r\noccupations. Might we not expect, from the testimony of the responsible\r\nofficers in charge of such establishments, to be informed of an awful\r\nannual sacrifice of life in such perilous occupations, from the\r\nterrible exposure of those employed in them in unpacking contagion, as\r\nit were wholesale? Have we any evidence from lazarettos to warrant the\r\nbelief in contagion? I think not; at least my _not_ very limited\r\nresearches have afforded me no such evidence, and I fear that it is\r\nwith the subject of contagion, as with other matters appertaining to\r\npestilence, that authors seek for the peculiar facts which especially\r\nfavour their preconceived opinions, whilst they strain the simple\r\nbearing of facts to answer their own hypotheses. Further, we find\r\npestilence still as prevalent and destructive as in former years in\r\nthose cities in which the march of improvement has not appeared. Thus\r\nGrand Cairo and Constantinople to this day are never free from the\r\nplague. Grand Cairo is always crowded by a vast number of inhabitants\r\nof the lowest order in the most abject state of poverty. The streets\r\nare very narrow and close, and thirty or forty persons often inhabit\r\none small house. It is situated in a sandy plain at the foot of a\r\nmountain, which, by excluding the winds, makes the heat more stifling.\r\nThrough the midst of it passes a great canal, which is filled with\r\nwater at the periodical overflowing of the Nile, and after the river\r\nhas fallen it is gradually dried up; into this are thrown all manner\r\nof filth, carrion, &c., so that the stench which arises from this and\r\nthe mud together is insufferably offensive. At certain periods of the\r\nyear the plague preys upon the inhabitants, first appearing amongst the\r\nlowest orders of the people, who are mostly in a wretched condition:\r\nits progress is stopped only when the Nile, by overflowing, washes away\r\nthis load of filth; the cold winds, which set in at the same time,\r\npurifying the air. The plague in Constantinople is generally observed\r\nto break out in that part of the city which is low and marshy.\r\n\r\nOn searching the ancient records of medicine, and on referring to\r\nhistory, both sacred and profane, nothing in the shape of evidence can\r\nbe found, previously to the time of Hippocrates, to show that epidemic\r\npestilences were thought to be contagious; in fact, all writers before\r\nthe Arabians invariably speak of epidemic diseases as arising from\r\nplaces, seasons, and constitutions of the air; and nowhere in his\r\nworks does the great parent of medicine, the erudite and all-observant\r\nHippocrates, entertain the idea of contagion:--Δεῖ δὲ καταμανθάνειν τὴν\r\nΚατάστασιν τῶν ‘Ωρέων ἀκριβῶς, καὶ τῶν Νούσων ἑκάστην.\r\n\r\nI would ask of all unprejudiced persons, What could contagion have had\r\nto do with the terrific and wide-spreading outbreak of pestilence at\r\nKurrachee (see ‘History of Pestilences,’ p. 177), where 8000 victims\r\nwere at once seized and carried off in a few days?\r\n\r\nBut that which I would urge in support of the\r\nNON-CONTAGIOUSNESS of epidemic pestilences, irrespective\r\nof EVERY other authority, is the remarkable fact, that in\r\nour most ancient medical treatise, the 13th chapter of Leviticus,\r\nno mention whatever is made of epidemic diseases being reckoned\r\ncontagious, although at the time when the Levitical code was being\r\npropounded there was no lack of experience in epidemic diseases;\r\nfor in the days of Moses the times in Egypt were calamitous\r\nindeed:--pestilence and famine ran riot through the land. Had epidemic\r\ndiseases, then so common and lethal in Egypt, been considered\r\ncontagious, the presumption is that they would have been enumerated as\r\nsuch among those which were specified as possessing that character,\r\nviz. leprosy, scabies, lues, &c.; and when we observe such minuteness\r\ndisplayed in the Mosaic ordinances, to the very freeing of houses from\r\ndamp previously to occupation, we cannot suppose that precautionary\r\ndirections, as regards such universal and lethal maladies as epidemics,\r\nwould have been omitted. With this remarkable fact before us, derived\r\nfrom sacred authority, I feel at a loss to conjecture the grounds\r\non which the idea of contagion is _at all entertained_, more\r\nespecially as we have the occurrence of pestilential disease not only\r\nforetold, but their very nature and mode of production positively\r\nconveyed to us from the same divine source.\r\n\r\n“The Lord shall smite thee with a consumption, and with a fever, and\r\nwith an inflammation, and with an extreme burning,” &c. (Deut. chap,\r\nxxviii.)--“And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and\r\nshall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast,\r\nthroughout all the land of Egypt.” (Exod. chap, ix.)--“But the hand\r\nof the Lord was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and\r\nsmote them with emerods” (violent dysentery), “even Ashdod and the\r\ncoasts thereof.” (1 Sam. chap, v.)--“I also will do this unto you; I\r\nwill even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning ague,”\r\n&c. (Levit. chap. xxvi.)--“I will smite the inhabitants of this city,\r\nboth man and beast: they shall die of a great pestilence.” (Jeremiah,\r\nchap. xxi.)--The sun and the moon standing still in their habitations,\r\nthe mountains trembling, the waters overflowing, causing famine and\r\npestilence. (Habakkuk, chap. iii.)--“Behold, I will send a blast upon\r\nhim.” (2 Kings xix.)--“The Lord shall make the rain of thy land powder\r\nand dust.” (Deut. xxviii.)--“Thy heaven shall be brass, and the earth\r\niron.” (Ibid.)--“And if the family of Egypt go not up, and come not,\r\nthat have no rain, there shall be the plague,” &c. (Zechariah, chap.\r\nxiv.)\r\n\r\nIn conclusion: fully impressed with the necessity that for the\r\npurpose of insuring anything like rational conclusions as to the\r\nnature and origin, or causes, of epidemic pestilences, we should\r\nnot only enter upon their investigation divested of all prejudice\r\nin favour of _exclusive_ doctrines, but at the same time be\r\nactuated by an impartial desire for COMPREHENSIVNESS, as\r\nbeing the only, the true way to surmount the innumerable difficulties\r\nattendant on the investigation of universal distempers, and premising\r\nwith the opinion that at the onset we should be cognizant of the\r\n_absolutely_ necessary distinction between the predisposing and\r\nthe exciting causes of disease, the due consideration of which guides\r\nto preventive or sanitary measures, _I take leave_ to reiterate\r\nmy opinion,--an opinion founded on a careful review of the foregoing\r\nhistory of epidemics,--that all epidemic pestilences or diseases are\r\nto be accounted for on the principle of natural causes, viz., THAT\r\nATMOSPHERIC DISTURBANCE, CONSISTING OF VARIATIONS OF TEMPERATURE,\r\nHYGROMETRIC INFLUENCE, ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE, ELECTRICAL TENSION &C.,\r\nARE THE EXCITING CAUSES; WHILE, ON THE OTHER HAND, WANT OF LIGHT,\r\nIMPURE AIR, ESPECIALLY FROM DEFECTIVE VENTILATION, IN WHICH ARE\r\nINCLUDED MALARIA AND ALL OTHER NOXIOUS VAPOURS, FROM WHATEVER SOURCE\r\nARISING; SCANTY DIET, AND HABITS INDUCED BY THE IRREGULAR, ARTIFICIAL\r\nLIFE OF MANY, ARE THE PREDISPOSING CAUSES, WHICH BY ENERVATING AND\r\nOTHERWISE SPOILING THE SYSTEM, RENDER IT MORE SUSCEPTIBLE OF EXTERNAL\r\nATMOSPHERIC IMPRESSIONS IN THE PRODUCTION OF EPIDEMIC PESTILENCE OR\r\nDISEASE.\r\n\r\nΛεγέτω μὲν οὖν περὶ αὐτοῦ ὡς ἕκαστος γιγνώσκει, καὶ ἰατρὸς, καὶ\r\nἰδιώτης, ἀφ’ ὅτου εἰκὸς ἦν γενέσθαι αὐτὸ, καὶ τὰς αἰτίας ἅστινας\r\nνομίζει τοσαύτης μεταβολῆς ἱκανὰς εἶναι δύναμιν ἐς τὸ μεταστῆσαι\r\nσχεῖν. And now I leave every one, whether physician or not, to pass his\r\nown opinion concerning it, pointing out whence it was likely to arise,\r\nand what causes he thinks sufficient to produce so entire a change in\r\nthe constitution of the human body.”--(Thucydides on Epidemics.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n            PROPHYLAXIS: OR THE MODE OF PREVENTING DISEASE.\r\n\r\n    “Organic forms with chemic changes strive,\r\n    Live but to die, and die but to revive;\r\n    IMMORTAL MATTER braves the transient storm,\r\n    Mounts from the wreck, unchanging but in form.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe original mandate of the Creator has provided that by various\r\nnatural processes a constant equilibrium shall be preserved and\r\nmaintained, so that from age to age, until all the purposes for which\r\nthe earth is sustained be completed, the same ends will be accomplished\r\nby the same agency:\r\n\r\n    “That very law which moulds a tear\r\n    And bids it trickle from its source,\r\n    That law preserves the earth a sphere,\r\n    And guides the planets in their course.”\r\n\r\nWe further know that all organized matter, whether animal or vegetable,\r\npossesses the materials of which they are composed, for a limited time\r\nonly, life itself being but a boon, lent to serve the purposes of\r\nInfinite Wisdom--\r\n\r\n    “Which thus alternating with death fulfil\r\n    The silent mandates of the Almighty’s will;\r\n    Whose hand unseen the works of Nature dooms,\r\n    By laws unknown;--who gives and who resumes.”\r\n\r\nAgain, on reviewing the histories of bygone ages, we learn that from\r\nthe earliest times disease has visited every country with a frequency\r\nand malignancy always proportioned to the intensity of the predisposing\r\ncauses. Under the head of Nature and Causes of Disease, I have already\r\nadvanced that disease arises from certain conditions or vicissitudes of\r\nthe atmosphere, together with the application of other powers producing\r\ndirect debility. Over the former, as the exciting, the vital cause,\r\nwe have but little control; it is the latter only, the predisposing\r\ncauses, that we can attempt to counteract with a fair prospect of\r\nsuccess. Seeing that such predisposing causes more generally arise from\r\nthe infraction of the unalterable laws originally laid down for the\r\ngovernment of mankind,--from a neglect of the most obvious laws of our\r\nbeing,--and that Providence, for the most part, acts by SECONDARY\r\nCAUSES, we should direct our efforts to the arresting of every\r\ncondition which _predisposes_ to or aggravates disease, such\r\ncondition being more or less subject to human regulations.\r\n\r\n“Prevention,” says the adage, “is better than cure.” When the sources\r\nof sickness have been remedied, the production of the evil has been\r\nlimited, if not totally annihilated; it is, therefore, to the adoption\r\nand enforcement, by judicious legislative enactments, of prophylactic\r\nmeasures, based on scientific views, that we would direct especial\r\nattention; for by such measures we not only, to a great extent, prevent\r\ndisease, by rendering the body less susceptible of it, but, when\r\nattacked by it, we lessen its fatality, by placing the vital system in\r\na normal condition, capable of bearing up against it:--\r\n\r\n   “Salus populi est suprema lex.”\r\n\r\nIt is a lamentable fact, that in this our own country, with all its\r\npractical talent, and its great advance in civilization, hitherto so\r\nlittle progress has been made in a matter deeply involving the moral,\r\nas well as the physical, condition of the great mass of our population.\r\nAs one proof out of many of what may be effected by judicious measures,\r\nwe may advert to the present condition of our navy, as contrasted\r\nwith that of the last century. Formerly we heard among our seamen of\r\nnothing but dysentery, fevers, scurvy, &c., which diseases have been\r\nknown to depopulate whole fleets. In the year 1726, when at sea, great\r\nmortality occurred from these scourges in the fleet, consisting of\r\nseven ships, under the command of Admiral Hosier, on the West India\r\nstation. He twice lost the crew of his own ship. In the year 1741, also\r\nat sea, half the crew of Captain Anson’s fleet died from scurvy in less\r\nthan six weeks after leaving England; and in the year 1780, 11,732\r\ncases of scurvy, dysentery, and fever were sent to Haslar Hospital\r\nfrom the Channel fleet! whilst now, from the attention paid to the\r\nconstruction of our shipping, to ventilation, cleanliness, and diet, we\r\nscarcely meet with these diseases among the seamen, and the wards of\r\nHaslar Hospital, which formerly were crowded with cases of scorbutic\r\ndisease, now seldom exhibit a case.\r\n\r\nThe two grand essentials for vitality are Light and Air, to which may\r\nbe added, Water. These, which are supplied to us by an all-wise and\r\nbeneficent Creator in unlimited abundance, are indispensably necessary\r\nto a healthy state of animal life; the absence of the one, or impurity\r\nof the other, as being detrimental to life, should take the lead of all\r\nsanitary measures.\r\n\r\n                   “Light----\r\n              ----Nature’s resplendent robe!\r\n    Without whose vesting beauty all were wrapt\r\n    In unessential gloom.”\r\n\r\nWe know from experience, that the influence of light and atmospheric\r\ntemperature upon living bodies is very similar, being manifested by\r\nthe strongest stimulating effects; in fact, light is known to be\r\nan important agent in varying the phenomena of the atmosphere, its\r\nstimulating effects being more or less modified by light, according to\r\nthe permanence and intensity of such light. The sun being the principal\r\nsource of light and heat, their influences may be considered as\r\ninseparable, and acting in concert; if a thermometer were to be removed\r\nfrom the dark into the light, the mercury would be seen to rise, and,\r\non the other hand, if it were to be conveyed from the light to the\r\ndark, it would fall.\r\n\r\n    “In tubes of glass mercurial columns rise,\r\n    Or sink obedient to the incumbent skies;\r\n    Or as they touch the figured scale, repeat\r\n    The nice gradations of circumfluent heat.”\r\n\r\nMilton beautifully apostrophizes the great luminary, Light, thus:\r\n\r\n    “Hail, Holy Light! offering of Heaven’s first-born,\r\n    Or of the eternal co-eternal beam,\r\n    Bright effluence of bright essence increate,--\r\n    Thy fountain who shall tell? Before the sun--\r\n    Before the heavens thou wert, and at the voice\r\n    Of God, as with a mantle, didst invest\r\n    The rising world of waters dark and deep.”\r\n\r\nCommencing with the properties of light, we find its influence on\r\ninorganic bodies and vegetables to be unequivocal; in short, it may\r\nbe said that so very extensive is its influence, that there is not a\r\nsubstance which, when exposed to its action, does not experience some\r\nalteration. Without light, independently of the heat which is its\r\nordinary concomitant, there would scarcely exist a trace of vegetation,\r\nand when we reflect on the remarkable dependence of the animal and\r\nvegetable kingdoms on each other, the animal by the extrication of\r\ncarbonic acid gas, affording a fluid essential to vegetation; the\r\nplant, on the other hand, by the emission of oxygen, supplying the\r\natmosphere with the gas which is equally necessary for the well-being\r\nof the former, we cannot suppose light to be less essential to animal\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThe chemical effects of light, and its influence on animal and\r\nvegetable vitality, have much engaged the attention of philosophers:--\r\n\r\n    “O Sun--\r\n    Thou shin’st in boundless majesty abroad,\r\n    High gleaming from afar--prime cheerer, heat;\r\n    Of all material beings first and best!\r\n    Efflux divine!\r\n    Without thy quickening glance, our cumbrous mould\r\n    Were brute, unlovely mass, inert and dead;\r\n    And not as now, the sweet abode of life.\r\n    How many forms of Being wait on Thee!\r\n    Inhaling spirit; from the unfetter’d mind,\r\n    By thee sublimed, down to the daily race,\r\n    The mixing myriads of thy setting beam--\r\n    The vegetable world is also thine!\r\n    The very dead Creation, from thy touch,\r\n    Assumes a mimic life. But this\r\n    And all the much-transported Muse can sing,\r\n    Are, to thy splendour, dignity, and _use_,\r\n    Unequal far! Great delegated Source\r\n    Of Light and Life, and Grace and Joy below.”\r\n\r\nWith reference to the vegetable kingdom, we see that the most delicate\r\nof the discous plants or flowers turn constantly towards the sun; it is\r\nalso well known that the change of position of the leaves of plants,\r\nat different periods of the day, is entirely owing to the agency of\r\nlight; plants growing in the shade, or in darkness, are pale, and\r\nwithout their natural and healthy colour--they become ‘etiolated’ or\r\nblanched. Gardeners avail themselves of a knowledge of this fact,\r\nand, by excluding the light, they obtain celery, lettuce, &c., in a\r\nwhite state. If a potato be placed in a dark cell, with but one small\r\naperture for the admission of light, on germinating, the sprout will\r\nturn and grow towards the light, and will continue pale and light until\r\nit reaches the light, and becomes fairly exposed to its stimulus, when\r\nits natural and healthy colour will be assumed.\r\n\r\nLight contributes to the maturity of seeds, fruit, and flowers.\r\nProfessor Davy found by experiment that red rose-trees, carefully\r\nexcluded from light, produced roses almost of a white colour.\r\nVegetables are not only indebted to the light for their colour,[3] but\r\ntheir taste and odour are likewise derived from, or at all events\r\ngreatly influenced by, the same source. Light is also an essential\r\nelement in the topographical arrangement of plants. The southern slopes\r\nof our hills and mountain ranges are always clothed with a more fully\r\ndeveloped race of plants than the northern; this depends wholly upon\r\nthe greater degree of light and heat which the former enjoy. The more\r\nfree the exposure, the more readily will most plants blossom, and yield\r\na rich fruit; so well is this understood in the grape countries on\r\nthe Rhine, that the right bank of that river, which faces the sun, is\r\nreckoned to be much more valuable than the left, and commands a higher\r\nprice for its wines.\r\n\r\nTurning to the animal kingdom, which is more immediately our province,\r\nwe find in that portion of nature an equal dependence on light for its\r\nproper development and vitality. Animals droop when they are deprived\r\nof light; there are instances on record where persons having been long\r\nconfined in dark places or dungeons (even though well ventilated),\r\ntheir whole complexion has become sallow, their general health\r\ndeteriorated, pustules, with aqueous humours, have opened out upon\r\ntheir skin, and they have become languid, and frequently dropsical.\r\nIn the absence of light, there is a predominance of the white fluids\r\nof the body; the action of the lymphatic system is exalted, and it\r\nimparts to the organization of animals that remarkable blanched\r\nappearance called ‘etiolement.’ Hence the well-founded supposition,\r\nthat the absence of the solar rays of light contributes greatly to the\r\ndevelopment of scrofula.\r\n\r\n“Let in the sun, and you shut out the doctor,” says an old Italian\r\nproverb. The effects of the free admission of light, as a point of\r\ngreat importance to the well-being of every individual, has been proved\r\nby the experiments of Dr. Edwards, who has shown that if tadpoles\r\nbe nourished with proper food, and exposed to the renewed action\r\nof water (so that their bronchial respiration may be maintained),\r\nbut are entirely deprived of light, the growth continues, but their\r\nmetamorphosis into the condition of air-breathing animals is arrested,\r\nand they remain in the form of large tadpoles. Dr. Edwards also\r\nobserves, that persons who live in caves and cellars, or in very dark,\r\nnarrow streets, are apt to produce deformed children. Rabbits, which\r\nwere kept in a dark cellar, were affected with mollities ossium, their\r\nlimbs being useless.\r\n\r\nIt has been recently stated, that the cases of disease in the dark side\r\nof an extensive barrack at St. Petersburgh, have been uniformly, for\r\nmany years, in the proportion of THREE to one to those on the\r\nside exposed to a strong light.\r\n\r\nDupuytren relates the case of a lady whose maladies had baffled the\r\nskill of several eminent practitioners. This lady resided in one of\r\nthe narrow streets of Paris, and in a dark room in which the sun never\r\nshone. After a careful examination, Dupuytren was led to refer her\r\ncomplaints to the absence of light, and recommended her removal to a\r\nmore cheerful situation: the change was followed by the most beneficial\r\nresults; all her complaints in a very short time vanished.\r\n\r\nIn a series of experiments made by Mr. Simon upon cats, which that\r\ngentleman confined in dark cellars, he found after death disease of\r\nthe kidney, resembling that morbid state of the gland generally known\r\nas morbus Brightii (Bright’s disease), and, in other cases, incipient\r\nfatty degeneration of the liver.\r\n\r\nHumboldt has remarked, that among several nations of South America, who\r\nwear very little clothing, he never met with a single individual with\r\na natural deformity; and the celebrated Linneus, in his account of his\r\ntour through Lapland, enumerates constant exposure to solar light as\r\none of the causes which render a summer’s journey through high northern\r\nlatitudes so peculiarly healthful and invigorating; whilst the reverse\r\nis observed in less favoured regions--\r\n\r\n                      ---- “beyond Tornea’s Lake,\r\n    And farthest Greenland, to the Pole extreme,\r\n    Where, failing gradual, Life itself goes out;\r\n    There Winter holds his unrelenting court.\r\n    Near the wild Oby live the last of men!\r\n    There, half-enliven’d by the distant Sun,\r\n    That rears and ripens man as well as plants--\r\n    There human nature wears its lowest form!”\r\n\r\nWe will now enter upon the consideration of another of the grand\r\nessentials of vitality. Air--\r\n\r\n   “Vivit Ætherias vitaleis suscipit auras.”\r\n\r\nThe word ‘atmosphere’ is of Greek origin, and signifies a body of\r\nvapour in a spherical form. The rapidity of atmospheric air cannot be\r\nexplained on any principle but its fluidity; therefore atmospheric\r\nair, the permanently elastic fluid which surrounds the earth, although\r\ninvisible, may be said to be material, and to possess all the common\r\nproperties of matter; for it occupies space, attracts and is attracted,\r\nand consequently has weight. It likewise partakes of the nature of\r\na fluid, for it adapts itself to the form of the vessel in which it\r\nis contained, and presses equally in all directions. Its power, when\r\nvitiated, as a cause of disease, can only be determined by a scientific\r\nexamination of its properties, especially as regards its affinities\r\nto other things. It should therefore claim the attention of every\r\nindividual, professional or non-professional, who has the comfort of\r\nmankind at heart.\r\n\r\n“It is scarcely possible,” says Professor Davy, “duly to appreciate,\r\nin the vast economy of terrestrial adaptations, the importance of the\r\nmechanism by which gases and vapours rapidly permeate each other’s\r\nbulks and become equally diffused. The atmosphere which surrounds the\r\nglobe consists of a mixture of several aeriform fluids in certain fixed\r\nproportions, upon the proper maintenance of which, by measure and\r\nweight, the welfare of the whole organic creation depends.”\r\n\r\nOne of the principal uses of the atmosphere is to supply animals with\r\na medium for breathing. Breathing is an essential effort of the human\r\nsystem. Its immediate effects are the operation of considerable changes\r\non the blood--\r\n\r\n   “In the blood is life, which vitality depends on air.”\r\n\r\nAn outlet is also afforded to carbonic acid gas, and the acquisition\r\nof a quantity of oxygen and nitrogen, which, combining with the\r\nconstituent parts of the chyle, convert it into the nature and quality\r\nof nutritious blood. The temperature of the animal is supposed also\r\nto be a consequence of the decomposition of air in the respiratory\r\nprocess. The processes of respiration and combustion perpetually tend\r\nto the destruction of the vital air, and the substitution of another,\r\nwhich is a deadly poison to animal life. By means of ventilation\r\nand circulation,--causing currents of air,--such poisonous air is\r\nnot allowed to accumulate, but is diffused through the surrounding\r\nspace, while the vital gas rushes, by a counter-tendency, to supply\r\nthe deficiency which the local consumption may have created; and thus\r\nis explicable one of the self-apparent reasons as to the imperious\r\nnecessity for free ventilation.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding our imperfect acquaintance with the manner in which\r\nwater is suspended in the atmosphere, it is well known that the human\r\nbody is greatly influenced by the aqueous vapour in such a state of\r\nsuspension, and that the sources of poisonous emanations are active in\r\nproportion to the grade of atmospheric humidity and its temperature.\r\nAn atmosphere surcharged with humidity not only prevents the cuticular\r\ndischarge necessary to a healthy state, but sensibly diminishes the\r\nwatery exhalations from the lungs, thereby inducing various morbid\r\neffects on the system. We observe the conversion of volatile bodies\r\ninto a gaseous form exemplified in the perfume of flowers being more\r\nsensible during the fall of dew of an evening or in a morning, when the\r\ndew evaporates and is dissipated by the rays of the morning sun: in the\r\nsame manner, the exhalation of deleterious matters, such as the filth\r\nof ditches and badly-drained sewers, becomes more active. Excess of\r\nmoisture also, by diminishing the vital action, provides another cause\r\nof disease in conjunction with the enervating effects of deleterious\r\ngases: hence the more poisonous properties or injurious action of those\r\ngases in stagnant atmospheres, which are always more humid than where\r\nthere is efficient circulation, _i. e._ ventilation.\r\n\r\n    “Of what important use to human kind,\r\n    To what great ends subservient is the wind!\r\n    Where’er the aerial active vapour flies,\r\n    It drives the clouds, and ventilates the skies;\r\n    Sweeps from the earth Infection’s noxious train,\r\n    And swells to wholesome rage the sluggish main.\r\n    For, should the sea unagitated stand,\r\n    Death, with huge strides, would desolate the land;\r\n    The scorching sun, with unpropitious beam,\r\n    Would give to grief an everlasting theme;\r\n    And baneful vapours, lurking in the veins,\r\n    Would fiercely burn with unabating pains.\r\n    Such were the plagues that spread o’er Egypt’s land,\r\n    When Moses, taught by God, stretch’d forth his hand;\r\n    From animated dust fell myriads rose,\r\n    And vengeance shed o’er Israel’s harden’d foes.”\r\n\r\nSignal benefit from ventilation was observed some years ago in the\r\nSavoy and Newgate prisons, in both of which the jail fever was, as\r\nit had always been, frequent and very fatal. It was tried on the\r\nrecommendation of the great and good Dr. Hales, whose studies and\r\nexperiments were constantly directed to the benefit of mankind. The\r\ngood effects exceeded even the Doctor’s most sanguine expectations, for\r\nthe numbers attacked were greatly decreased, and the fever became less\r\nfatal, after due ventilation had been established, and the supposed\r\ncontagion had been thereby arrested. On a reference to the writings\r\nof the benevolent Howard, we shall perceive that he found the prisons\r\non the Continent perfectly free from pestilential fever, owing to the\r\napartments in which the prisoners were confined being spacious and\r\nwell-aired.\r\n\r\n    “Leaves, lungs, and gills the vital ether breathes,\r\n    On earth’s green surface, or the waves beneath.”\r\n\r\nDr. Thomas Bateman, writing on the low fevers of London occurring\r\namong the poor, observes that he has often been surprised, after having\r\nseen a patient in the low muttering delirium of fever while in his own\r\nhabitation, to find him with clear intellect and invigorated system\r\nafter passing a night in the House of Recovery, although no medicine\r\nwhatever had been given. We have ourselves observed the remarkable\r\nand decided effects on the pulse, caused by the removal of patients\r\nsuffering from low typhus and other fevers;--their improvement has been\r\ngeneral and decided, merely from the removal from a lower to an upper\r\nward, where the ventilation has been more perfect. Of the many striking\r\nillustrations of the benefit resulting from the free access of pure\r\nair, the remarkable decrease of disease and death among the carnivora\r\nin the Zoological Gardens, as reported in 1845, since the improvement\r\nof the ventilation, may be instanced. The following statement,\r\ntaken from the history of the Dublin Lying-in Hospital, shows in an\r\nextraordinary degree the advantages resulting from free ventilation. In\r\nthis hospital, 2944 infants out of 7650 died in the years 1782–83–84\r\nand 1785, within the first fortnight after their birth,--that is to\r\nsay, nearly one child out of every six died of convulsions, which were\r\ncalled nine days’ convulsions by the nurses. These children foamed at\r\nthe mouth, the jaws became locked, the face swelled, and looked blue,\r\nas though they were choking. This last circumstance led the physician\r\nin attendance to attribute the disease and great mortality to the close\r\nand crowded state of the hospital, causing a deficiency of good air.\r\nAir-pipes, with other openings, were contrived,--the rooms were kept\r\nsweet and fresh by means of ventilation,--and the consequences observed\r\nwere, that in the year\r\n\r\n    1786 out of 1372 children there died  51\r\n    1787   „    1375    „         „       59\r\n    1788   „    1496    „         „       55\r\n                ----                    ----\r\n                4243                     165\r\n\r\nSo that, since ventilation has been properly effected, out of 4243\r\nchildren there died 165; whereas the average number of deaths from the\r\nsame numbers, previously to ventilation, was 1632!\r\n\r\n    “And all proclaim Omnipotence Divine.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    We view his kind, his life-preserving care,\r\n    In all the wondrous properties of AIR.\r\n    Were once the energy of _air_ denied,\r\n    The heart would cease to pour its purple tide;\r\n    The purple tide forget its wonted play,\r\n    Nor back again pursue its curious way;\r\n    Gross vapours would the springs of life pervade,\r\n    And make the brightest human blossom fade.”\r\n\r\nDr. Barron, among a series of experiments, confined a number of\r\nyoung rabbits in a close damp situation; many of the animals died at\r\nintervals varying from five to seven weeks from the time of their\r\nincarceration. On the removal of the survivors to dry localities, which\r\nwere otherwise favourable to health from being well ventilated, their\r\ncondition soon became manifestly improved. This fact has been further\r\nconfirmed by the experiments of Sir James Clark and Dr. (now Sir\r\nRobert) Carswell and Dr. Jenner.\r\n\r\nIn a report of the sickness which occurred among the Edinburgh Police,\r\nas drawn up by the medical attendant, the effects of an ill-ventilated\r\nstation-house are noticed. It furnishes an additional example, if such\r\nwere needed, of the importance of pure air and plenty of it. The men\r\nboarded and lodged in this place were originally the healthiest and\r\nyoungest men in the force; yet the rate of sickness among them was\r\nvery high, as was also the mortality--being more than treble that of\r\nthe other part of the force located elsewhere. Out of thirty-seven men\r\noccupying the house in question, only one was found to be free from\r\nfunctional disorder: the prominent symptoms being great sensibility to\r\natmospheric changes, copious cold perspirations, a constant sense of\r\nfatigue, with pain in the eye-balls and loss of appetite.\r\n\r\nIt would appear that in all propositions for sanitary improvements,\r\nthe all-engrossing topic is--the noxious properties of stinking\r\nvapours. The cesspools and sewers seem to be the chief object of\r\nsolicitude, even in legislative proceedings; as though there were\r\nno deleterious gases surrounding our globe, inappreciable to the\r\nolfactories, and yet of far more consequence in a sanitary point of\r\nview. Now, although vapours arising from cesspools and imperfect\r\ndrainage unquestionably constitute one of the many predisposing causes\r\nto disease, they are not of such paramount importance as ventilation;\r\nfor their noxious influence, from whatever source they may arise,\r\ndepends more or less on their existence in open or confined places.\r\nThe indefatigable Parent Duchâtelet, in his work on ‘HYGIENE\r\nPUBLIQUE,’ has shown that stenches, filthy exhalations, however\r\ndisgusting, are not necessarily the cause of disease, when not pent\r\nup, as _à priori_ they might be supposed to be. He informs us\r\nthat at one of the most extensive ‘Chantierres d’Equarrissages,’\r\nsituated at Montfauçon, within a mile or two of Paris, occupying a\r\nlarge open space of ground, where thousands of horses, dogs, and cats\r\nare taken yearly to be slaughtered, and where almost all the ordure\r\nof Paris is collected together, the most abominable stenches are to\r\nbe met with: the ground, saturated with the blood of the slaughtered\r\nanimals, sends forth a most disgusting fœtor, as do also the enormous\r\nmounds of putrid flesh collected for the purposes of manure, and for\r\nthe generation of maggots for feeding poultry! Yet the workmen living\r\nand employed in these places, in the filthy occupation of glue and\r\nmusic-string making, &c., enjoy an immunity from disease that is truly\r\nastonishing, while their exemption from illness during the destructive\r\nprevalence of cholera in Paris was equally remarkable. The existence\r\nof such disgusting nuisances, as represented by Duchatelet, can by no\r\nmeans be approved of; but reference to them is made here to show, by\r\nwell-ascertained facts, that the remedying of the effluvia arising\r\nfrom imperfect drainage, cesspools, _et hoc genus omne_, is\r\nnot of such VITAL importance as the free admission of the\r\natmosphere; for we have seen that stagnant air is caused by the want\r\nof a free current, and that it is rendered more humid than usual by the\r\nnon-admission of light (which is heat), and further that that humidity\r\nincreases the activity of noxious gases, so that where ventilation is\r\ndefective, there will always be an accumulation, and consequently\r\na concentration, of the gases from cesspools, exhalations from the body\r\nby expiration, and from the skin; all these facts, physiologically\r\nconsidered, will show the vast importance of the access of light and\r\nof pure air, on which all sanitary measures, to be effective, must\r\nbe based. Ventilation, by striking at the root of the mischief, will\r\nremedy all its evil consequences.\r\n\r\nAgain, it must be recollected that the object of ventilation is not\r\nsolely to dissipate and get rid of odours offensive to the olfactories,\r\nbut also to supply the system with a vital stimulus--the very\r\n_pabulum vitæ_--the oxygen necessary for the proper performance\r\nof the functions of the different organs, which cannot be obtained in\r\ndue proportion from stagnant air--the supply in such an atmosphere from\r\ndefective circulation being inadequate to the demand or consumption.\r\nWhen an animal is inclosed in a limited quantity of atmospheric air,\r\nit dies as soon as the oxygen has been consumed; and no other air\r\nwill maintain animal life but oxygen, or a mixture which contains it\r\nin a certain proportion. Further, ventilation, by supplying the vital\r\nstimulus, and inducing a normal condition, also fortifies the system\r\nagainst atmospheric vicissitudes--the grand excitant of disease.\r\n\r\nOpening up and enlarging drains, or establishing them where none\r\nhad previously existed, while the localities are allowed to remain\r\nin a crowded state, will, while such operations are being carried\r\non, multiply the evil. A commencement must be made by rasing to the\r\nground the dens of physical and moral iniquity which have been so\r\ndisgracefully permitted to exist in the occupancy of those unfortunates\r\nwho have it not in their power to remedy the miseries to which it never\r\nwas the intention of Creative Wisdom that the meanest reptile should be\r\nsubjected, much less Man, once the image of his Creator,--His noblest\r\nwork!\r\n\r\nThe subjects of Light and Air having been disposed of, we will next\r\ndiscuss the properties of Water:\r\n\r\n    “That chief ingredient in Heaven’s various works,\r\n    Where flexile genius sparkles in the gem,\r\n    Grows firm in oak, and fugitive in wine.”\r\n\r\nIt is a necessary beverage for man and other animals,--is perpetually\r\nused as a solvent for a great variety of solid bodies,--acts an\r\nimportant part in conveying nourishment to the vegetable world,\r\nand gives salubrity to the atmospherical regions,--in fine, it is\r\na fluid so generally distributed over our globe, and consequently\r\nso universally known, that to enter into the minutiæ of its various\r\nproperties would be superfluous for the purposes of these pages.\r\n\r\n    “If there be any universal medicine in nature,\r\n    It is water”--says HOFFMAN.\r\n\r\nConsidering water dietetically as well as medicinally, it cannot\r\nbut be a matter of wonder, to all who know anything of the water\r\ndrunk in this great metropolis, that no measures have ever been\r\ntaken for the purification of an element so essential to a healthy\r\nexistence, although many excellent plans have from time to time\r\nbeen suggested by persons practically conversant with such matters.\r\nIn the Report of a committee of the House of Commons, published so\r\nfar back as 1836, it is stated of the water from the Thames, that\r\nit “receives the excrementitious matter from nearly a million and a\r\nhalf of human beings;--the washings of their foul linen,--the filth\r\nand refuse of many hundred manufactories,--the offal and decomposing\r\nvegetable substances from the markets,--the foul and gory liquid from\r\nslaughter-houses,--and the purulent abominations from hospitals and\r\ndissecting-rooms, too disgusting to detail.” The polluted state of the\r\nwater supplied to this vast metropolis is not, however, the only crying\r\nevil. The deficiency in quantity as well as the deleterious quality is\r\nalso a matter of just complaint, the supply of this first necessary of\r\nlife being insufficient for drinking and culinary purposes, independent\r\nof its uses as an hygienic agent, for personal ablution; the salutary\r\neffects of which we will next consider--\r\n\r\n    “And in the bath prepared my limbs I lave.\r\n    Reviving sweets repair the mind’s decay,\r\n    And take the painful sense of toil away.”\r\n\r\nThe use of the bath has doubtlessly existed from the beginning of\r\nthe world. Bathing appears to have been a practice instinctively\r\nadopted by all nations and tribes throughout the universe. Amongst\r\nthe North and South American Indians--in Africa--even among the most\r\nbarbarous and uncivilized races--bathing is a usage to which they pay\r\n_scrupulous_ attention: yet, strange to say, to this day, personal\r\nablution is little known or practised in this otherwise proudly\r\npre-eminent country, as a hygienic agent: it is viewed more as a matter\r\nof luxury, and then but very sparingly had recourse to, even by our\r\nwealthy and middle classes.\r\n\r\nSocrates tells us that “bathing renders a man pure, both in soul and\r\nbody.” Clemens Alexandrinus says, it should be practised “for the sake\r\nof HEALTH and cleanliness, and, lastly, of pleasure.”\r\n\r\nThe ancient Romans considered the bath as the most important item\r\nin the economy of their lives: they regarded it as indispensable\r\nfor health and comfort;--an idea of the magnificence and luxurious\r\nconstruction of the Roman baths may be formed from the poetical\r\ndescription by Statius, of the baths of Claudius Etruscus:\r\n\r\n    “Nothing there’s vulgar: not the fairest brass\r\n    In all the glittering structure claims a place.\r\n    From _silver_ pipes the happy waters flow,\r\n    In _silver cisterns_ are received below.\r\n    See where with noble pride the doubtful stream\r\n    Stands fixed with wonder on the shining brim;\r\n    Surveys its riches, and admires its state;\r\n    Loath to be ravish’d from the glorious seat.”\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable bagnios were those of the Emperor Dioclesian and\r\nAntonius Caracalla, with their curiously vaulted roofs, spacious\r\napartments, and a thousand other ornaments and conveniences. Those of\r\nDioclesian occupied 140,000 men many years in building them.\r\n\r\nBathing acts morally, as well as physically. It induces habits of\r\ncleanliness, which are found allied only with self-respect, improved\r\ntemperance, intelligence, and morality.\r\n\r\n    “This is the purest exercise of Health!\r\n    Thus life redoubles; and is oft preserved\r\n    By the bold swimmer, in the swift illapse\r\n    Of accident disastrous.--Hence the limbs\r\n    _Knit into force! and the same Roman arm\r\n    That rose victorious o’er the conquer’d earth,\r\n    First learn’d, while tender, to subdue the wave!!_\r\n    E’en from the _body’s_ purity, the _mind_\r\n    Derives a secret, sympathetic aid!!”\r\n\r\nNothing is more soothing to the irritable impulses of the passions,\r\nthan the peculiar serenity which the bath imparts. The Romans in their\r\ndays of sensuality, invariably had recourse to the bath to relieve the\r\neffects of their dissipation, and of great fatigue from travelling, &c.\r\nWho is there, we would ask, that has not experienced, after a night’s\r\ndebauch in the indulgence of luxuries, when the head and heart have\r\nbeen oppressed, and the nervous energies prostrated, the restorative\r\nand invigorating effects of the bath,--for what allays feverish\r\nirritability and perturbation of the nervous system so admirably as the\r\n_cold_, _tepid_, or _hot bath_, according as the offender may have been\r\naccustomed to use. Everywhere on the Continent, baths are to be had in\r\nthe greatest state of perfection. The French perform entire personal\r\nablution daily. In Italy, Holland, and Germany they patronise the bath\r\nto a great extent, and amongst the Turks and Persians, and throughout\r\nAsia, bathing is imperative as a part of their religion. They consider\r\nit an absolute necessary of life, whilst we, the most refined people in\r\nthe world, are satisfied with a change of linen, and that too, very\r\noften over a not very clean under-garment, or body flannel!\r\n\r\nThe Hungarians and Russians bathe after the manner of the ancients;\r\nin Russia especially, where the bath makes so much a part of the\r\nsystem of living, it is used by persons of every age, and under all\r\ncircumstances. A Russian considers that the bath is a remedy for all\r\nhis ailments; he flies to it on all occasions; men, women at their\r\nlying-in, and children, in almost all sicknesses, and before and after\r\na journey, &c., resort to the bath as their _solatium_--which, to\r\nuse the words of the illustrious Cullen, “imparts a sense of youth,\r\nvigour, and self-complacency.” The Romans for five hundred years\r\ntogether were without physicians; it was by means of the bath they\r\neffected all their cures of disease, and to this day many nations cure\r\ntheir maladies by the use of baths,--in which there is nothing so very\r\nmarvellous, as the simplicity of such means at first sight may lead\r\npersons to suppose, when we consider the importance of the skin in the\r\nanimal economy, that it is not merely the organ of sensation, but that\r\nit is endowed with an extensive and complicated nervous apparatus,\r\nthrough which its sympathies with the entire organism are managed, and\r\nthat it possesses extensive secretory, excretory, and absorbing powers,\r\nthe _normal condition_ of these functions being essential not only\r\nto _health_, but _to life itself_.\r\n\r\nConsidering our pretensions to all that is refined, there is perhaps no\r\nrace of people more devoid of personal cleanliness than ourselves.[4]\r\nThis is a fact (however unpleasant the reference to it may be) that\r\nadmits of no contradiction, for the greater proportion, including\r\neven the _higher_ and the middle classes of the population of\r\nthis country, are never subjected to entire ablution during the whole\r\nperiod of their lives,--from their childhood to their death. Fancy an\r\noctogenarian sweltering in the accumulated impurities of three-fourths\r\nof a century!\r\n\r\n   “Buried in smoke, in filth, and poisonous damps.”\r\n\r\nCan it be wondered at that _he_ hands down to his offspring a\r\ncorrupt, a tainted condition of fluids, which entails misery on them in\r\nthe shape of scrofula, and every variety of skin disease?\r\n\r\nIndependent, however, of any hereditary predisposition to skin and\r\nother diseases, it is too much the custom for persons who merely splash\r\nwith water their neck, face, and hands daily,--neglecting to wash their\r\nbodies from year to year, so that the effete matters of the system\r\nbecome condensed on the skin, thereby obstructing the exhalant pores,\r\nand causing various internal complaints, and very frequently universal\r\nitching,--to reconcile themselves with the idea that their sufferings\r\nhave been caused by a scorbutic diathesis, which has been communicated\r\nto them by their progenitors, without any fault of their own, or any\r\nreference to their own filthy personal habits.\r\n\r\nThere is perhaps no greater absurdity than the common notion, that\r\nwashing the face and hands, and occasionally the feet, constitutes\r\npersonal cleanliness, or that such partial ablution can act\r\nhygienically. It is from all parts of the body’s surface (more so from\r\nsome than from others, especially from those that are covered) that\r\nchemical compounds and effete elements are eliminated in the shape of\r\nthe sensible and insensible perspiration--therefore, to escape the\r\nevils attendant on filthy personal habits, we must not be content with\r\npartial ablution, but extend it to the entire body.\r\n\r\nTo all those who may be ignorant of, or any way sceptical on, the\r\npoint of the hygienic value of personal ablution, we would recommend\r\nthe perusal of the writings of Drs. Andrew Combe, Southwood Smith,\r\n&c.--they will then become acquainted with the important uses and\r\nfunctions of their _own covering_,--they will find in the\r\nabove-mentioned authorities the subject of cuticular economy ably\r\ninvestigated, and the intimate connexion of the outer and inner skins\r\n(the one being a continuation of the other) clearly set forth, showing\r\nthat through the perspiratory system, consisting of openings in the\r\nskin called pores, the temperature of the body is not only managed to a\r\ncertain extent, but also that a number of compounds, noxious to animal\r\nlife, are removed from the system, by which means the blood and other\r\nfluids are kept in a state of purity. Perspiration, both as to matter\r\nor quality and its quantity, is absolutely necessary for the well-being\r\nof the human body: and in order to give some idea of the injurious\r\neffects of interference with the functions of the skin by the retention\r\nand the necessary accumulation of innumerable chemical agents, we\r\nmay refer to Lavoisier and Seguin’s researches on the subject. It\r\nwas estimated by them that _eight grains_ of perspiration are\r\nexhaled by the skin in the course of _a minute_, a quantity which\r\nis equivalent to _thirty-three ounces_ in the _twenty-four\r\nhours_. On the cuticular surface it has been computed by them that\r\nthere are seven millions of pores, which being blocked up by impurities\r\nfor want of personal cleanliness, must prevent the elimination of\r\ntheir contents, and these being again thrown into the system by the\r\ncirculation, cannot but be highly detrimental to health. Again,\r\n\r\nIRRESPECTIVE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE SKIN TO EXTERNAL LIFE, IT\r\nIS NO LESS SO TO THE INTERNAL ECONOMY OF THE BODY IN PRESERVING THE\r\nGRAND EQUILIBRIUM OF THE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS (THE BODY BEING A SYSTEM OF\r\nSYSTEMS) BY WHICH THE HUMAN FRAME IS SUPPORTED.\r\n\r\nTo a want of personal purification by washing, therefore, the frequency\r\nof many of our most distressing and fatal diseases, such as those of\r\nthe lungs and of the kidneys, termed consumption and Bright’s disease,\r\nmay be traced, as also the affection so common in this country, and\r\nvery justly termed ‘an Englishman’s inheritance,’ ‘dyspepsia,’ by our\r\nmaking the lungs, the kidneys, and bowels, which are depurating organs\r\nas well as the skin, act the part of scavengers to the entire system,\r\nin the elimination of the greater portion of its impurities, and thus\r\nperform the proper office of the skin.\r\n\r\n“We know,” says an experienced and talented writer, “no country of\r\nEurope where there is so little disposition on the part of the people\r\nas in ours to give themselves even the exhilarating kind of ablution\r\nwhich is derived from bathing. Dirty faces, dirty clothes, dirty\r\nhouses,--in fine, dirt all over,--are the characteristics of our\r\npeople; and yet, bad as they are (from necessity generally), we know\r\nthat there are worse effects underneath the surface, for where physical\r\ndirt is seen, there also presides _moral degradation_.”\r\n\r\nIt is true that within the last few years many praiseworthy exertions\r\nhave been used for the purpose of establishing baths and wash-houses\r\nfor the poor, which it is to be hoped will meet with further\r\nencouragement and extension; but as fashion rules a large portion of\r\nmankind, even in physic, we would suggest, that in order to secure a\r\nmore complete and general use of personal ablution, our leaders of\r\nfashion and the upper classes who have so much to say on the subject\r\nof wash and bath-houses for the poor, should set the example by\r\nestablishing baths, after the custom of the Orientals, in their own\r\nprivate residences; for, in spite of the increase of wealth and luxury,\r\nof the splendour and extent of the houses of recent erection in this\r\ncountry, baths are very far from being universal. Much may also be\r\nattained by patronising the few excellent but neglected public baths\r\nof this great metropolis; such measures would not only have the effect\r\nof increasing the number of those baths already established, but of\r\ninducing, from the increased facility, that personal purification,\r\nwhich ultimately would be found to be indispensable. “_Usus est\r\naltera natura._”\r\n\r\nIn concluding these our remarks on the three grand essentials to life,\r\nwe would observe that it is astonishing with what little amount of\r\nfood a human being may live in health and strength, (we of course\r\nallude to those who eat to live,) when supplied in due proportion\r\nwith the requisites for vitality,--namely, LIGHT, AIR, and WATER.\r\nFurther, we would ask, what can be more monstrous in this enlightened\r\nage, so outrageous of every principle of reason--so contrary to daily\r\nexperience and common sense, as “the barring-out the free fresh air,\r\nand the meting-out to mortals of Heaven’s light,” by that blot on\r\ncivilization, the window-tax,--a tax which originated in iniquity,[5]\r\nat a time, too, when so much is being agitated about sanitary\r\nmeasures?[6] We neglect the first principles of vitality, to go\r\ngroping into sewers and cesspools, which we repeat are but secondary\r\nconsiderations, the _ultimatum_ of which will prove to be but little\r\nbetter than the relief of the olfactories, to tickle the gustatory\r\nnerves by furnishing for our palates, in the shape of Thames water, the\r\nfilthy abominations of an overgrown city.\r\n\r\nWhile on the subject of Prophylaxis, we must not omit allusion to the\r\nbarbarous and pestiferous custom of intramural burial, which cannot\r\nbe too strongly deprecated, as being not only subversive of every\r\nChristian feeling--from the daily revolting spectacle of violated\r\nsanctuaries--but otherwise demoralizing in the extreme, and poisonous\r\nto the public. “Pessimum est tempore Pestis habitare in locis mortuorum\r\nmonumentis propinquis.”\r\n\r\nFrom the disgusting apathy evinced in this huge metropolis in the\r\ndisposal of the dead, it would appear that nothing short of one of\r\nthose terrible epidemic inflictions--inflictions with which in former\r\ndays the Almighty was wont to visit the iniquities of his people, will\r\nbring those whose immediate province it is to a sense of the evils and\r\nperils of such abominations, which they, in spite of common sense,\r\nactuated by cupidity and fool-hardiness, still perpetuate.\r\n\r\n    “Ye who amid this feverish world would wear\r\n    A body free of pains, of cares the mind,\r\n    Fly the rank city; shun the turbid air;\r\n    Breathe not the Chaos of eternal smoke,\r\n    And volatile corruption from the dead,\r\n    The dying, sickening, and the living world\r\n    Exhaled, to sully Heaven’s transparent dome\r\n    With dim mortality.”\r\n\r\nThat interment, or enclosing the dead in a grave, is a most ancient\r\ncustom, there cannot be a doubt. Amongst the ancient Jews to have no\r\nburial was reckoned among the greatest of calamities. The exposure\r\nin any manner of their dead (even criminals) was looked upon as a\r\npollution of their land. The Egyptians and Asiatics practised interment\r\nfrom the beginning of time. Subsequently, it became the custom to\r\n_burn_ the bodies of the dead. By Homer’s description of the\r\nfuneral of Patroclus, it would appear that the Greeks used burning as\r\nearly as the Trojan war. They also had recourse to interment, as is\r\nseen by their historians, who give an account of the manner in which\r\nthe body was placed in the grave: Plutarch tells us that they were\r\nlaid with their faces towards the east or towards the west; and Cicero\r\ninforms us that, in early times, as those of Cecrops, interment was\r\naltogether made use of by the Greeks,--but we have ample testimony\r\nin history that it always took place _without_ their cities,\r\nparticularly amongst the Jews and Greeks, from whom the Romans derived\r\nthe practice. We have several passages in the New Testament, showing\r\nthat the Jews buried their dead _without_ their city. Thus,\r\nthe sepulchre in which Joseph of Arimathea laid our Saviour’s body\r\nwas in the same place where he was crucified (John xix. 41), which\r\nwas near the city (John xix. 20). And we are taught in St. Matthew\r\n(xxviii. 52–53), that, at our Lord’s passion, the graves were opened,\r\nand many bodies of the saints which slept, arose and came out of the\r\ngraves after his resurrection, and _went into the Holy City_, and\r\nappeared unto many.\r\n\r\nServius, in giving an account of the unhappy death of his colleague\r\nMarcellus, which happened in Greece, says that he could not by any\r\nmeans obtain leave of the Athenians to allow him a burying-place\r\n_within_ the city. The Romans observed the same custom from the\r\nfirst building of their city; it afterwards became a law, as settled by\r\nthe Decemviri, “Neither burn nor bury within the city.” They generally\r\nburied near the highways, in fields appropriated for the purpose.\r\nTheir reason seems to have been founded on sacred as well as civil\r\nconsiderations: among the former, that passengers might see the graves,\r\nand be reminded of their own mortality--hence, as Varro tells us, the\r\ninscription on the monuments, ‘Sta viator!’--among the latter, “that\r\nthe air might not be corrupted by the stench of putrifying bodies.” It\r\nis related of Propertius, that he was very earnest in desiring that\r\nhe might not be buried after the ordinary custom, near a _road_,\r\nfor fear it should disturb his shade. There were, however, exceptions\r\namongst the Romans to the prohibition of intramural burials, as in the\r\ncase of the Vestal Virgins, who, Servius informs us, were allowed by\r\nlaw a burying-place within the city. The same privilege or honour was\r\npermitted to some extraordinary persons, as to Valerius Publicola and\r\nto Fabricius, to continue to their heirs; yet none of their families\r\nwere afterwards interred there, but the body being carried thither,\r\nsome one placed a burning torch under it, and then immediately took it\r\naway, as an attestation of the deceased’s privilege, and his receding\r\nfrom the honour. The body was then removed for burial to another place\r\nwithout the city.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Persians never buried in cities or towns. Their kings were\r\ninterred on a high hill on the east of Persepolis: generally throughout\r\nPersia and the Levant, there were no burying-places except those\r\nwithout the city.\r\n\r\nThe cemeteries of the Turks were always without the towns, that the air\r\nmight not be corrupted by the vapours arising from the graves: they,\r\nin like manner as the Romans, also bury by the sides of highways, that\r\ntravellers may be reminded to pray to God for the deceased. The Chinese\r\nadopt a similar kind of sepulture. Eusebius informs us that when the\r\nChristians, by favour of Constantine, built churches in the cities,\r\nthey had their burial-places allotted them outside the cities and towns.\r\n\r\nAccording to Gregory of Tours, it was not until the latter part of\r\nthe sixth century, about A.D. 590, that funeral places and\r\ncemeteries within the towns were consecrated.\r\n\r\nIntramural burials and churchyards, it would seem, originated in the\r\nidea that persons passing the graves of their relatives or friends on\r\ntheir way to worship, might be reminded to offer up prayers for them;\r\nand the profit might also be another motive. The gross and horrible\r\nindignities now so frequently offered to the dead in consequence of\r\nover-crowding, to the great scandal of our national religion and\r\ncharacter as a Christian people, could never have been contemplated; on\r\nthe contrary, it was intended to offer a sacred asylum for the mortal\r\nremains of those whose memories were dear to us.\r\n\r\nIt was a maxim, not only with the Jews, but with all nations of the\r\nworld, that holy places are polluted by the presence of dead carcases\r\nor of dead men’s bones. Hence we find that when Josiah desired to\r\nprofane the altars dedicated to idols, he burned dead men’s bones upon\r\nthem, which he took out of the sepulchres that were on the mount (2\r\nKings xxiii. 16). And when God threatened by Ezekiel to punish Israel,\r\nhe told them that their altars should be desolate: “and I will lay the\r\ndead carcases of the children of Israel before their idols, and I will\r\nscatter your bones round about your altars.” (Ezekiel vi. 5.) As the\r\nJews by the divine law had ablutions, washings, and purifications for\r\ndefilements by the dead, which is called Βαπτισμὸs ἀπὸ νεκρῶν\r\n(Ecclesiasticus xxxiv. 25),--a washing from the pollution contracted\r\nby the touch of a dead body,--so the Gentiles also from them had the\r\nrite of purification for defilements contracted from the dead; for the\r\n_Flamens_ or _Funera Mater_, when dismissing the people after\r\na funeral, sprinkled them with water to purge them of the pollution\r\nreceived by the sight of the interment; and on their entering into a\r\ntemple, they were first sprinkled with holy water, the ωυραντιεια, so\r\noften mentioned by heathen writers, lest they should appear polluted\r\nbefore the gods.\r\n\r\nHosperian informs us that the ancients greatly opposed the innovation\r\nof burying in towns and churches, and on that account the councils of\r\ntheir bishops made several canons and decrees against intramural and\r\nchurch burials.\r\n\r\nWhether the ancients burned or interred their dead, they never made\r\nchoice of the place of divine worship, either to bury the body or\r\ndeposit its ashes. For centuries after Christianity was established,\r\nthey never presumed to make God’s temple the carnicle of the dead: on\r\nthe contrary, when the ancient mode of burial without the city began\r\nto be neglected, burials in churches were opposed by authority. A law\r\nin the Theodosian Code has these words: “Let no one imagine that the\r\nchurches of the Apostles and Martyrs were designed for burial-places\r\nfor the dead.” The Emperor Charles the Great has this injunction, “Let\r\nno one bury any dead in the church.” Subsequently, Louis the Pious\r\nmost strenuously opposed burying within the churches, requiring “that\r\nthe constitutions, used and settled by the ancient Fathers, should be\r\nobserved in the burial of the dead.”\r\n\r\nSo tenacious were the ancients of anything like desecration of their\r\nchurches, that we are told by Baronius that one Borachas being\r\npersecuted by the Gentiles at Gaza, and having been left for dead, the\r\nChristians took him up and carried him into the church; the Gentiles\r\nand some of the authorities, on making inquiry for him, complained that\r\nthe Christians had broken the liberty of their city, and had trespassed\r\nagainst their laws: for that they had brought a dead body into the\r\ncity, which ought in no wise to be done; they supposing that Borachas\r\nwas dead.\r\n\r\nThe being buried in or near a church, we are told, originated with the\r\nfirst Christian emperor, Constantine, who, although he did not desire\r\nto be buried within the church (a thing in his day unheard-of), was\r\nresolved that his remains should be deposited as near as possible to\r\nit, and they were accordingly inhumed in the porch of the great church\r\nat Constantinople. Subsequently, the practice increased, and persons of\r\nquality claimed a similar privilege; their inferiors again, although\r\nthey claimed not the right of being buried within the porches, deemed\r\nit an honour to be buried as near thereto as possible; hence, another\r\nreason assigned for large courts and yards about churches.\r\n\r\n    “The melancholy ghosts of dead renown\r\n    With penitential aspect, as they pass’d,\r\n    All point at earth and smile at human pride.”\r\n\r\nSome time after, Pope Gregory the Great brought into the churches, and\r\nset up in the most solemn manner, relics enshrined in cases of gold,\r\nwhich were sometimes placed upon, or over, but generally under the\r\naltar. This made persons flock towards them, and bury their dead there,\r\nin the hope that both might receive benefit from such veneration.\r\nThus, that which was originally considered a profanation, ultimately,\r\nthrough the corruption of subsequent ages, became not only a means\r\nof satisfying ambitious pride, but also apparently of conferring the\r\nblessings of eternal happiness.\r\n\r\nThe custom of interring persons of rank in churches was first\r\nintroduced into this country by Cuthbert, the tenth Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury, who in the year A.D. 798 procured the privilege\r\nfrom the Pope to have churchyards for interment: with reference to\r\nburying in churches, the custom did not arise earlier than the year\r\n1076. In the reign of William the Conqueror, the council held at\r\nWinchester, under Lanfranc, Archbishop of Canterbury, by the ninth\r\ncanon, opposed burial in churches; it soon after, however, became a\r\ncustom, and vaults were built under the altars.\r\n\r\n“It is horrid,” said the Austrian emperor, “that a place of worship--a\r\ntemple of the Supreme Being--should be converted into a pest-house for\r\nliving creatures.”\r\n\r\nA person who upon his death-bed makes it a condition in his will that\r\nhe should be buried in a church or chapel, acts like a madman; he\r\nought to set his fellow-creatures a good example, and not do all in his\r\npower to destroy their health by exposing them to the effluvia arising\r\nfrom a corpse in a state of putrefaction.\r\n\r\nThe following extract is from a sermon preached in 1552 by Bishop\r\nLatimer, which proves that even at that comparatively early period,\r\nwhen the population of London could scarcely have been one-fifth of\r\nwhat it is now, the nuisance of intramural interments was found to be\r\ndangerous to health. “The citizens of Naim,” observed the bishop, “hadd\r\ntheir buryinge-place withoute the citie, which no doubt is a laudable\r\nthinge; and I doe marvel that London, being soe great a citie, hath\r\nnot a burial-place without; for no doubt it is an unwholesome thinge\r\nto bury within the citie, especiallie at such a time when there be\r\ngreat sicknesses and manie die together. I think, verilie, that many\r\na man taketh his death in St. Paul’s churchyard, and this I speak of\r\nexperience, for I myself, when I have been there some mornings to heare\r\nthe sermons, have felt such an ill-savoured and unwholesome savour,\r\nthat I was the worse for it a great while after; and I think no lesse\r\nbut it is the occasion of great sicknesse and disease.”\r\n\r\nWell would it have been for the inhabitants of this vast metropolis had\r\nSir Christopher Wren’s plan been carried out at the rebuilding of the\r\ncity, after the fire of 1666. All churchyards were to have been removed\r\nwithout the town.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1786, the legislature of Germany passed a law, which was\r\npunctually observed in the empire over which Joseph the Second ruled,\r\nand which we would do well to imitate, instead of using the under-part\r\nof our chapels as store and pest-houses. This law prohibited the\r\nburying of dead bodies in any chapel or church whatever; neither rank\r\nnor affluence can obtain permission to evade it, as in the enforcement\r\nof it no respect is paid to persons.\r\n\r\nOf the injurious and fatal effects of exhalations from overcharging\r\nburial-places, we have a striking illustration, that scarcely admits\r\nof a doubt[7]--at least, as far as predisposition goes. In an old\r\nwork, entitled ‘Dr. Dover’s Ancient Physician’s Legacy,’ we have\r\nthe following; Dover, it must be understood, was an extraordinary\r\ncharacter, uniting in his own person the profession of physic and\r\nbuccaneering. He says:--“When I took by storm the two cities of\r\nGuyaquil, under the line, in the South Seas, it happened that, not long\r\nbefore, the plague had raged amongst them. For our better security\r\nand the keeping of our people together, we lay in the churches, and\r\nlikewise brought thither the plunder of the cities. We were very much\r\nannoyed by the smell of the dead bodies. These could hardly be said to\r\nbe buried; for the Spaniards abroad use no coffins, but throw several\r\ndead bodies, one upon another, with only a draw-board over them; so\r\nthat it was no wonder we caught the infection. In a few days after we\r\nwent on board, one of the surgeons came to acquaint me that several of\r\nmy men were taken after a violent manner, with that languor of spirits\r\nthat they were not able to move; in less than forty-eight hours, we had\r\nin our ships one hundred and eighty men in this miserable condition.”\r\n\r\nDr. Adam Clarke, in his ‘Commentary on St. Luke,’ advises that “No\r\nburying-places should be tolerated within CITIES or TOWNS, much less in\r\nor about CHURCHES and CHAPELS. This custom is excessively injurious to\r\nthe inhabitants, and especially to those who frequent public worship\r\nin such CHAPELS and CHURCHES. God, decency, and health forbid this\r\nshocking abomination. * * * From long observation I can attest that\r\nCHURCHES and CHAPELS situated in graveyards, and those especially\r\nwithin whose walls the dead are interred, are perfectly unwholesome;\r\nand many, by attending such places, are shortening their passage to\r\nthe house appointed for the living. What increases the iniquity of\r\nthis abominable and deadly work is, that the burying-grounds attached\r\nto many CHURCHES and CHAPELS are made a source of PRIVATE GAIN. The\r\nwhole of this preposterous conduct is as indecorous and unhealthy as\r\nit is profane. Every man should know that the gas which is disengaged\r\nfrom putrid flesh, and particularly from a human body, is not only\r\nunfriendly to, but destructive of, animal life. Superstition first\r\nintroduced a practice which self-interest and covetousness continue to\r\nmaintain.”\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Dr. Render, in his ‘Tour through Germany’ published in London,\r\nin the year 1801, mentions the following case:--“In the month of\r\nJuly, 17--, a very corpulent lady died at----. Before her death, she\r\nbegged, as a particular favour, to be buried in the parochial church:\r\nshe died on the Wednesday, and on the following Saturday was buried\r\naccording to her desire. The day following, the clergyman preached\r\nher funeral sermon: the weather was uncommonly hot; and it ought to\r\nbe observed that, for several months preceding her death, a great\r\ndrought had prevailed; not a drop of rain had fallen, consequently it\r\nwas an uncommonly sultry season. The succeeding Sunday, the Protestant\r\nclergyman had a very full congregation, upwards of 900 persons\r\nattending, that being the day for administering the Holy Sacrament. The\r\nweather still continuing very hot, many were obliged during the service\r\nto walk out for a time, to avoid fainting; whilst some actually fainted\r\naway. It is the custom, in Germany, that when people wish to receive\r\nthe sacrament, they neither eat nor drink that day, until the ceremony\r\nis entirely over. The sermon occupied about one hour and a quarter;\r\nafter which the bread was consecrated, and, according to custom,\r\nremained uncovered during the ceremony.\r\n\r\n“There were about one hundred and eighty communicants. A quarter of an\r\nhour after the ceremony, before they had quitted the church, more than\r\nsixty of them were taken ill; several died in the most severe agonies;\r\nothers, of a more vigorous constitution, survived by the help of\r\nmedical assistance; a most violent consternation prevailed throughout\r\nthe whole congregation and town. It was concluded that the wine had\r\nbeen poisoned, and so it was generally believed; the sacristan, and\r\nseveral others belonging to the vestry, were immediately arrested, and\r\ncast into prison. The clergyman, on the succeeding Sunday, preached\r\nvery excitingly, and pointed out to his congregation several others\r\nconcerned in the plot. This enthusiastic sermon was printed. The\r\npersons accused underwent very great hardships; during the space of a\r\nweek they were confined in a dungeon, and some of them were put to the\r\ntorture; but they persisted in asserting their innocence. On the Sunday\r\nfollowing, the magistrate ordered that a chalice of wine, uncovered,\r\nshould be placed for the space of an hour upon the altar, which time\r\nhad scarcely elapsed when they beheld the wine filled with myriads\r\nof insects; and by tracing them to their source it was at length\r\nperceived, by the rays of the sun, that they issued from the grave of\r\nthe lady who had been buried the preceding fortnight. The people not\r\nbelonging to the vestry were dismissed, and four men employed to open\r\nthe grave and the coffin; in doing which two of them dropped down, and\r\nexpired upon the spot; and the other two were only saved by the utmost\r\nexertion of medical talent. It is beyond the power of words to describe\r\nthe horrid sight of the corpse when the coffin was opened. The whole\r\nwas a mass of entire putrefaction; and it was now clearly demonstrated\r\nthat the numerous insects, both large and small, together with the\r\neffluvia which had issued from the body, had caused the pestilential\r\ninfection, which was a week before attributed to poison. On this\r\ndiscovery, those who had been accused of poisoning the wine, &c., were\r\nliberated, and atonement made by the clergyman and magistrate for their\r\nunfounded charge.”\r\n\r\nIt was said by St. Cyril, when offering an excuse for the mode of\r\nburial of the Gentiles, “that their temples were only beautiful\r\nmonuments of dead men.” How differently would he have expressed himself\r\nwith regard to our Christian metropolitan churches or temples of this,\r\nthe nineteenth century, which are loathsome receptacles of corruption!\r\n\r\nBut a few years ago, in the autumn of 1843, the poisonous effects\r\nof disturbing a graveyard were but too fatally evident. The church\r\nand churchyard of Minchinhampton are very old,--the latter having\r\nserved for a burying-ground for the previous five hundred years; it\r\nwas consequently densely crowded with dead bodies. In rebuilding the\r\nchurch, it became necessary, or was thought expedient, to lower the\r\nsurface of the graveyard to within a foot or two of the remains of\r\nthose buried. Many bodies were disturbed during this process, and\r\nre-interred. The earth so removed of a dark colour--saturated, in fact,\r\nwith the product of human putrefaction--was, in a fatal hour, devoted\r\nto the purposes of agriculture! About one thousand cart-loads were\r\nthus employed--some on a new piece of burial-ground, to make the grass\r\ngrow quickly, some as manure on the neighbouring fields, some in the\r\nrector’s garden! and some in that of the patron. The seeds of disease\r\nwere thus widely sown, and the result was such as any person of common\r\nsense might have expected. The diffusion of a morbid poison which\r\nsoon followed, was evinced by an outbreak of fever in this previously\r\nhealthy locality. The family of the rector, and the inhabitants of the\r\nstreets adjoining the churchyard, were the first attacked, and were\r\nalso the greatest sufferers. The rector lost his wife, his daughter,\r\nand his gardener. The patron’s gardener, who had been employed in the\r\nunseemly act of dressing flower-beds with human manure, also died.\r\nIn short, wherever the earth had been taken, disease followed. The\r\nchildren who attended the school took fever as they passed the upturned\r\nsurface of the graveyard, went home, and died; but they did not\r\ncommunicate the disease to those who came near them, nor did it occur\r\nin any person who had not been exposed to the cause of its development.\r\nSeventeen deaths occurred, and upwards of two hundred children were\r\nattacked with measles, scarlet fever, and peculiar eruptions.\r\n\r\nShould not the fearful consequences of such unhallowed proceedings be\r\nviewed as the retributive hand of Heaven, overtaking those concerned\r\nin the desecration of the dead? The appropriation of the soil, which\r\nshould have been held as sacred;--of human remains, for the purposes\r\nof agriculture--the cultivation of vegetables and flowers! and by one,\r\ntoo, holding the sacred office of a pastor. _O tempora! O mores!_\r\n\r\nConsidering the immense importance of the subject, in a moral as\r\nwell as in a physical point of view, it is lamentable in the extreme\r\nand truly disgraceful to a nation boasting of its character, general\r\nsuperiority, and wealth, that a practice (intramural burial) should\r\nobtain, in behalf of which no one single argument can be adduced, but\r\nagainst which, religion, history, common sense, and daily experience\r\nmay be arrayed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn reviewing the foregoing observations, and on seriously contemplating\r\nthe condition of the ill-ventilated rooms and workshops, the damp,\r\ndark, and insalubrious cellars,--little better than dungeons,--the\r\ndreary, close, stifling courts, and narrow dark alleys of this vast\r\nmetropolis, into which the light of heaven rarely penetrates;--we say,\r\nwhile contemplating these abodes of our lower classes, (which would\r\nbe injurious even to swine,) the culpable apathy, prejudice, and bad\r\narrangements of those whose duty it is to remedy such crying evils,\r\ncannot but be obvious. In conclusion, we would therefore earnestly\r\nrecommend to all such delinquents for their guidance, and to all those\r\nenlisted in the cause of sanitary reform, the salutary directions\r\nas to washing, cleansing, purification, &c., conveyed in the Mosaic\r\nOrdinances, especially in the following passages, as showing with what\r\nminuteness all matters appertaining to health, to the very freeing of\r\nhouses from damp, were directed; that we, the enlightened and refined\r\nof the nineteenth century, may profit thereby.\r\n\r\n“34 When ye be come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a\r\npossession, and I put the plague of leprosy[8] in a house of the land\r\nof your possession;\r\n\r\n35 And he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest, saying,\r\nIt seemeth to me _there is_ as it were a plague in the house:\r\n\r\n36 Then the priest shall command that they empty the house, before the\r\npriest go _into it_ to see the plague, that all that _is_ in\r\nthe house be not made unclean; and afterwards the priest shall go in to\r\nsee the house:\r\n\r\n37 And he shall look on the plague, and, behold, IF the plague\r\n_be_ in the walls of the house with hollow strakes, greenish or\r\nreddish, which in sight _are_ lower than the wall;\r\n\r\n38 Then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house,\r\nand shut up the house seven days:\r\n\r\n39 And the priest shall come again the seventh day, and shall look:\r\nand, behold, _if_ the plague be spread in the walls of the house;\r\n\r\n40 Then the priest shall command that they take away the stones in\r\nwhich the plague _is_, and they shall cast them into an unclean\r\nplace without the city:\r\n\r\n41 And he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about, and\r\nthey shall pour out the dust that they scrape off without the city into\r\nan unclean place:\r\n\r\n42 And they shall take other stones, and put _them_ in the place\r\nof those stones; and he shall take other mortar, and shall plaister the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n43 And if the plague come again, and break out in the house, after that\r\nhe hath taken away the stones, and after he hath scraped the house, and\r\nafter it is plaistered;\r\n\r\n44 Then the priest shall come and look, and, behold, _if_ the\r\nplague be spread in the house, it _is_ a fretting leprosy in the\r\nhouse: it IS unclean.\r\n\r\n45 And he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the\r\ntimber thereof, and all the mortar of the house; and he shall carry\r\n_them_ forth out of the city into an unclean place.”\r\n\r\n                                           LEVITICUS, chap. xiv.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             BIBLIOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n\r\n   _Acad._ de la Hist. sobre las Sepulturas, p. 60.\r\n\r\n   _Acerbi, Enrico_, Dottrina teorico-pratica del Morbo\r\n   petechiale.

The side on which the blows\r\nfell denoted the quarter where the disaster was to happen. Its sound,\r\nsays Dr. Dormer, caused dismay and contrition, with dismal “fear of\r\nchange,” in the hearts of all who heard it. No arm was strong enough to\r\nstop it on these occasions, as those found to their cost who profanely\r\nattempted it. Its ill-omened voice was heard for the twentieth and last\r\ntime in March, 1679. As no event of importance followed, it probably\r\ntolled for its own funeral. See the edifying history, in Dr. Diego\r\nDormer, of the miraculous powers and performances of this celebrated\r\nbell, as duly authenticated by a host of witnesses.--‘Discursos\r\nVarios,’ pp. 198–244. Prescott’s ‘History of Ferdinand and Isabella.’\r\n\r\n[2] The term Plague or Pestilence, as used here, is meant in its\r\ngeneral sense to express all sorts of distempers; the Hebrew Deber,\r\nwhich properly signifies plague, being used in the Hebrew tongue, as in\r\nmost others, to express every variety of epidemic disease.\r\n\r\n[3] Some time ago, some fagots were sent into the Lings coalpit,\r\nbelonging to the Wingerworth Coal Company, for the purpose of filling\r\nup the chasm over the timber, where the roof had given way. A bough of\r\nhawthorn was carelessly thrown aside in an opening, and it is now in\r\nfull leaf and blossom. A branch of it was brought out at night; but\r\nthe leaves, and blossoms also, began to flag in a few hours after it\r\nwas exposed to the fresh air. There is still a part of the thorn in\r\nthe pit, 500 yards from the bottom of the shaft, in a healthy growing\r\nstate; all the difference observable between a thorn growing on the\r\ntop of the ground, and the one above named, is, that the leaf is quite\r\nwhite, and the blossom without smell.\r\n\r\n[4] A writer punningly remarks, that “Notwithstanding our national\r\nsituation, and the dominion we naturally claim and boast of over the\r\nwatery element, a degree of Hydrophobia still prevails among us.”\r\n\r\n[5] A.D. 1695, on 31 Dec., the House of Commons resolved to raise\r\n£1,200,000 for supplying the deficiency of the clipped money by a tax\r\non windows.\r\n\r\n[6] Fortunately for the people, this tax was repealed while these pages\r\nwere passing through the press. It was not, however, deemed advisable\r\nto change the language used in the text.\r\n\r\n[7] For further evidence consult, _Diemerbroek_, _Agricola_, _Ammianus\r\nMarcellinus_, _Quincy_, _Wolfius_, and though last, not least, the\r\nworks of Mr. GEORGE ALFRED WALKER, that most _indomitable_ advocate for\r\nthe prevention of the most disgusting abuses of our dead, with the view\r\nof benefiting the stultified living.\r\n\r\n[8] In explanation of what is meant by this text, ‘Leprous House,’\r\nMichaelis observes that the walls of houses are often attacked by\r\nsomething that corrodes and spoils them. The walls become wet and\r\nmouldy from a mural salt, and that to such a degree as, in consequence\r\nof the erosion spreading further and further, to cause the house to\r\ntumble down; the plaster also becomes damaged, and requires frequent\r\nreplacing, furniture becoming spoiled, and persons being injured in\r\ntheir health, by sleeping near such walls. If we experience such\r\neffects in modern Europe, there is room to conclude that they were more\r\nstrongly exhibited at the earlier period under notice, and in countries\r\nwhere the houses were but of one story and low. Taking this, therefore,\r\nfor the ‘house leprosy,’ the object of the Mosaic law or ordinance\r\nis sufficiently intelligible. Besides, to this day there are certain\r\ndiseases of trees in Egypt and Palestine, to which the name of leprosy\r\nis given. In Switzerland, also, they speak of cancer in buildings on\r\nthe same principle, and why should we not understand the leprosy in\r\nbuildings of the text as being something of a similar description?\r\nIt is true that man, stone, and clothes have not the same diseases;\r\nbut from some analogous circumstances, real or fanciful, the diseases\r\nof man may be, and have been, evidently from the above, applied by a\r\nfigure of speech to diseases in other things.\r\n\r\nIf we believe that the house leprosy here spoken of was anything\r\nrelating to the disorder of the same name in man, it will be difficult\r\nto account for the symptoms and mode of treatment; and if we suppose\r\nthat the walls of the house had taken a leprous contagion from man,\r\nand were in a condition, when really infected, to transmit it to man,\r\nthe very direction to remove the furniture before the entering of the\r\npriest, would lead to the contrary opinion, for removing the furniture\r\nwould be calculated to propagate the leprous infection. It was the damp\r\nand unwholesome state of the house to which attention was directed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber’s Note:\r\n\r\n1.
