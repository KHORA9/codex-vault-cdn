DISP. l. 1. 9.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\nAll diseases originate in the exuberance, deficiency, or retrograde action,\r\nof the faculties of the sensorium, as their proximate cause; and consist in\r\nthe disordered motions of the fibres of the body, as the proximate effect\r\nof the exertions of those disordered faculties.\r\n\r\nThe sensorium possesses four distinct powers, or faculties, which are\r\noccasionally exerted, and produce all the motions of the fibrous parts of\r\nthe body; these are the faculties of producing fibrous motions in\r\nconsequence of irritation which is excited by external bodies; in\r\nconsequence of sensation which is excited by pleasure or pain; in\r\nconsequence of volition which is excited by desire or aversion; and in\r\nconsequence of association which is excited by other fibrous motions. We\r\nare hence supplied with four natural classes of diseases derived from their\r\nproximate causes; which we shall term those of irritation, those of\r\nsensation, those of volition, and those of association.\r\n\r\nIn the subsequent classification of diseases I have not adhered to the\r\nmethods of any of those, who have preceded me; the principal of whom are\r\nthe great names of Sauvages and Cullen; but have nevertheless availed\r\nmyself, as much as I could, of their definitions and distinctions.\r\n\r\nThe essential characteristic of a disease consists in its proximate cause,\r\nas is well observed by Doctor Cullen, in his Nosologia Methodica, T. ii.\r\nProlegom. p. xxix. Similitudo quidem morborum in similitudine causæ eorum\r\nproximæ, qualiscunque sit, reverâ consistit. I have taken the proximate\r\ncause for the classic character. The characters of the orders are taken\r\nfrom the excess, or deficiency, or retrograde action, or other properties\r\nof the proximate cause. The genus is generally derived from the proximate\r\neffect. And the species generally from the locality of the disease in the\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nMany species in this system are termed genera in the systems of other\r\nwriters; and the species of those writers are in consequence here termed\r\nvarieties. Thus in Dr. Cullen's Nosologia the variola or small-pox is\r\ntermed a genus, and the distinct and confluent kinds are termed species.\r\nBut as the infection from the distinct kind frequently produces the\r\nconfluent kind, and that of the confluent kind frequently produces the\r\ndistinct; it would seem more analogous to botanical arrangement, which\r\nthese nosologists profess to imitate, to call the distinct and confluent\r\nsmall-pox varieties than species. Because the species of plants in\r\nbotanical systems propagate others similar to themselves; which does not\r\nuniformly occur in such vegetable productions as are termed varieties.\r\n\r\nIn some other genera of nosologists the species have no analogy to each\r\nother, either in respect to their proximate cause, or to their proximate\r\neffect, though they may he somewhat similar in less essential properties;\r\nthus the thin and saline discharge from the nostrils on going into the cold\r\nair of a frosty morning, which is owing to the deficient action of the\r\nabsorbent vessels of the nostrils, is one species; and the viscid mucus\r\ndischarged from the secerning vessels of the same membrane, when inflamed,\r\nis another species of the same genus, Catarrhus. Which bear no analogy\r\neither in respect to their immediate cause or to their immediate effect.\r\n\r\nThe uses of the method here offered to the public of classing diseases\r\naccording to their proximate causes are, first, more distinctly to\r\nunderstand their nature by comparing their essential properties. Secondly,\r\nto facilitate the knowledge of the methods of cure; since in natural\r\nclassification of diseases the species of each genus, and indeed the genera\r\nof each order, a few perhaps excepted, require the same general medical\r\ntreatment. And lastly, to discover the nature and the name of any disease\r\npreviously unknown to the physician; which I am persuaded will be more\r\nreadily and more certainly done by this natural system, than by the\r\nartificial classifications already published.\r\n\r\nThe common names of diseases are not well adapted to any kind of\r\nclassification, and least of all to this from their proximate causes. Some\r\nof their names in common language are taken from the remote cause, as\r\nworms, stone of the bladder; others from the remote effect, as diarrhoea,\r\nsalivation, hydrocephalus; others from some accidental symptom of the\r\ndisease, as tooth-ach, head-ach, heart-burn; in which the pain is only a\r\nconcomitant circumstance of the excess or deficiency of fibrous actions,\r\nand not the cause of them. Others again are taken from the deformity\r\noccasioned in consequence of the unnatural fibrous motions, which\r\nconstitute diseases, as tumours, eruptions, extenuations; all these\r\ntherefore improperly give names to diseases; and some difficulty is thus\r\noccasioned to the reader in endeavouring to discover to what class such\r\ndisorders belong.\r\n\r\nAnother difficulty attending the names of diseases is, that one name\r\nfrequently includes more than one disease, either existing at the same time\r\nor in succession. Thus the pain of the bowels from worms is caused by the\r\nincreased action of the membrane from the stimulus of those animals; but\r\nthe convulsions, which sometimes succeed these pains in children, are\r\ncaused by the consequent volition, and belong to another class.\r\n\r\nTo discover under what class any disease should be arranged, we must first\r\ninvestigate the proximate cause; thus the pain of the tooth-ach is not the\r\ncause of any diseased motions, but the effect; the tooth-ach therefore does\r\nnot belong to the class of Sensation. As the pain is caused by increased or\r\ndecreased action of the membranes of the tooth, and these actions are owing\r\nto the increase or decrease of irritation, the disease is to be placed in\r\nthe class of irritation.\r\n\r\nTo discover the order it must be inquired, whether the pain be owing to\r\nincreased or defective motion of the pained membrane; which is known by the\r\nconcomitant heat or coldness of the part. In tooth-ach without inflammation\r\nthere is generally a coldness attends the cheek in its vicinity; as may be\r\nperceived by the hand of the patient himself, compared with the opposite\r\ncheek. Hence odontalgia is found to belong to the order of decreased\r\nirritation. The genus and species must be found by inspecting the synopsis\r\nof the second order of the class of Irritation. See Class I. 2. 4. 12.\r\n\r\nThis may be further elucidated by considering the natural operation of\r\nparturition; the pain is occasioned by the increased action or distention\r\nof the vessels of the uterus, in consequence of the stimulus of the fetus;\r\nand is therefore caused by increased irritation; but the action of the\r\nabdominal muscles in its exclusion are caused by the pain, and belong to\r\nthe class of increased sensation. See Class II. 1. 1. 12. Hence the\r\ndifficulty of determining, under what class of diseases parturition should\r\nbe arranged, consists in there being two kinds of diseased actions\r\ncomprehended under one word; which have each their different proximate\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nIn Sect. XXXIX. 8. 4. and in Class II. 1. 1. 1. we have endeavoured to give\r\nnames to four links of animal causation, which conveniently apply to the\r\nclassification of diseases; thus in common nictitation, or winking with the\r\neyes without our attention to it, the increased irritation is the proximate\r\ncause; the stimulus of the air on the dry cornea is the remote cause; the\r\nclosing of the eyelid is the proximate effect; and the diffusion of tears\r\nover the eye-ball is the remote effect. In some cases two more links of\r\ncausation may be introduced; one of them may be termed the pre-remote\r\ncause; as the warmth or motion of the atmosphere, which causes greater\r\nexhalation from the cornea. And the other the post-remote effect; as the\r\nrenewed pellucidity of the cornea; and thus six links of causation may be\r\nexpressed in words.\r\n\r\nBut if amid these remote links of animal causation any of the four powers\r\nor faculties of the sensorium be introduced, the reasoning is not just\r\naccording to the method here proposed; for these powers of the sensorium\r\nare always the proximate causes of the contractions of animal fibres; and\r\ntherefore in true language cannot be termed their remote causes. From this\r\ncriterion it may always be determined, whether more diseases than one are\r\ncomprehended under one name; a circumstance which has much impeded the\r\ninvestigation of the causes, and cures of diseases.\r\n\r\nThus the term fever, is generally given to a collection of morbid symptoms;\r\nwhich are indeed so many distinct diseases, that sometimes appear together,\r\nand sometimes separately; hence it has no determinate meaning, except it\r\nsignifies simply a quick pulse, which continues for some hours; in which\r\nsense it is here used.\r\n\r\nIn naming diseases I have endeavoured to avoid the affectation of making\r\nnew compound Greek words, where others equally expressive could be\r\nprocured: as a short periphrasis is easier to be understood, and less\r\nburthensome to the memory.\r\n\r\nIn the Methodus Medendi, which is marked by M.M. at the end of many of the\r\nspecies of diseases, the words incitantia, sorbentia, torpentia, &c. refer\r\nto the subsequent articles of the Materia Medica, explaining the operations\r\nof medicines.\r\n\r\nThe remote causes of many diseases, their periods, and many circumstances\r\nconcerning them, are treated of in the preceding volume; the descriptions\r\nof many of them, which I have omitted for the sake of brevity, may be seen\r\nin the Nosologia Methodica of Sauvages, and in the Synopsis Nosologiæ of\r\nDr. Cullen, and in the authors to which they refer.\r\n\r\nIn this arduous undertaking the author solicits the candour of the critical\r\nreader; as he cannot but foresee, that many errors will be discovered, many\r\nadditional species will require to be inserted; and others to be\r\ntransplanted, or erased. If he could expend another forty years in the\r\npractice of medicine, he makes no doubt, but that he could bring this work\r\nnearer perfection, and thence render it more worthy the attention of\r\nphilosophers.----As it is, he is induced to hope, that some advantages will\r\nbe derived from it to the science of medicine, and consequent utility to\r\nthe public, and leaves the completion of his plan to the industry of future\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\n  DERBY, _Jan._ 1, 1796.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nZOONOMIA.\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCLASSES OF DISEASES.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  I.

System._\r\n\r\nThe irritability of the whole, or of part, of our system is perpetually\r\nchanging; these vicissitudes of irritability and of inirritability are\r\nbelieved to depend on the accumulation or exhaustion of the sensorial\r\npower, as their proximate cause; and on the difference of the present\r\nstimulus, and of that which we had previously been accustomed to, as their\r\nremote cause. Thus a smaller degree of heat produces pain and inflammation\r\nin our hands, after they have been for a time immersed in snow; which is\r\nowing to the accumulation of sensorial power in the moving fibres of the\r\ncutaneous vessels during their previous quiescence, when they were benumbed\r\nwith cold. And we feel ourselves cold in the usual temperature of the\r\natmosphere on coming out of a warm room; which is owing to the exhaustion\r\nof sensorial power in the moving fibres of the vessels of the skin by their\r\nprevious increased activity, into which they were excited by unusual heat.\r\n\r\nHence the cold fits of fever are the occasion of the succeeding hot ones;\r\nand the hot fits contribute to occasion in their turn the succeeding cold\r\nones. And though the increase of stimulus, as of heat, exercise, or\r\ndistention, will produce an increased action of the stimulated fibres; in\r\nthe same manner as it is produced by the increased irritability which was\r\noccasioned by a previous defect of stimulus; yet as the excesses of\r\nirritation from the stimulus of external things are more easily avoided\r\nthan the deficiencies of it; the diseases of this country, except those\r\nwhich are the consequences of drunkenness, or of immoderate exercise, more\r\nfrequently begin with torpor than with orgasm; that is, with inactivity of\r\nsome parts, or of the whole of the system, and consequent coldness, than\r\nwith increased activity, and consequent heat.\r\n\r\nIf the hot fit be the consequence of the cold one, it may be asked if they\r\nare proportionate to each other: it is probable that they are, where no\r\npart is destroyed by the cold fit, as in mortification or death. But we\r\nhave no measure to distinguish this, except the time of their duration;\r\nwhereas the extent of the torpor over a greater or less part of the system,\r\nwhich occasions the cold fit; or of the exertion which occasions the hot\r\none; as well as the degree of such torpor or exertion, are perhaps more\r\nmaterial than the time of their duration. Besides this some muscles are\r\nless liable to accumulate sensorial power during their torpor, than others,\r\nas the locomotive muscles compared with the capillary arteries; on all\r\nwhich accounts a long cold fit may often be followed by a short hot one.\r\n\r\nSPECIES.\r\n\r\n1. _Febris irritativa._ Irritative fever. This is the synocha of some\r\nwriters, it is attended with strong pulse without inflammation; and in this\r\ncircumstance differs from the febris inirritativa of Class I. 2. 1. 1.\r\nwhich is attended with weak pulse without inflammation. The increased\r\nfrequency of the pulsation of the heart and arteries constitutes fever;\r\nduring the cold fit these pulsations are always weak, as the energy of\r\naction is then decreased throughout the whole system; and therefore the\r\ngeneral arterial strength cannot be determined by the touch, till the cold\r\npart of the paroxysm ceases. This determination is sometimes attended with\r\ndifficulty; as strong and weak are only comparative degrees of the greater\r\nor less resistance of the pulsation of the artery to the compression of the\r\nfinger. But the greater or less frequency of the pulsations affords a\r\ncollateral evidence in those cases, where the degree of strength is not\r\nvery distinguishable, which may assist our judgment concerning it. Since a\r\nmoderately strong pulse, when the patient is in a recumbent posture, and\r\nnot hurried in mind, seldom exceeds 120 strokes in a minute; whereas a weak\r\none often exceeds 130 in a recumbent posture, and 150 in an erect one, in\r\nthose fevers, which are termed nervous or putrid. See Sect. XII. 1. 4.\r\n\r\nThe increased frequency of the pulsation of the heart and arteries, as it\r\nis occasioned either by excess or defect of stimulus, or of sensorial\r\npower, exists both in the cold and hot fits of fever; but when the cold fit\r\nceases, and the pulse becomes strong and full as well as quick, in\r\nconsequence of the increased irritability of the heart and arteries, it\r\nconstitutes the irritative fever, or synocha. It is attended with\r\nconsiderable heat during the paroxysm, and generally terminates in a\r\nquarter of a lunation, without any disturbance of the faculties of the\r\nmind. See Class IV. 1. 1. 8.\r\n\r\nM. M. Venesection. Emetics. Cathartics. Cool the patient in the hot fit,\r\nand warm him in the cold one. Rest. Torpentia.\r\n\r\n2. _Ebrietas._ Drunkenness. By the stimulus of wine or opium the whole\r\narterial system, as well as every other part of the moving system, is\r\nexcited into increased action. All the secretions, and with them the\r\nproduction of sensorial power itself in the brain, seem to be for a time\r\nincreased, with an additional quantity of heat, and of pleasureable\r\nsensation. See Sect. XXI. on this subject. This explains, why at the\r\ncommencement of the warm paroxysm of some fevers the patient is in greater\r\nspirits, or vivacity; because, as in drunkenness, the irritative motions\r\nare all increased, and a greater production of sensation is the\r\nconsequence, which when in a certain degree, is pleasureable, as in the\r\ndiurnal fever of weak people. Sect. XXXVI. 3. 1.\r\n\r\n3. _Hæmorrhagia arteriosa._ Arterial hæmorrhage. Bleeding with a quick,\r\nstrong, and full pulse. The hæmorrhages from the lungs, and from the nose,\r\nare the most frequent of these; but it sometimes happens, that a small\r\nartery but half divided, or the puncture of a leech, will continue to bleed\r\npertinaciously.\r\n\r\nM. M. Venesection. Cathartic with calomel. Divide the wounded artery. Bind\r\nsponge on the puncture. If coffee or charcoal internally? If air with less\r\noxygen?\r\n\r\n4. _Hæmoptoe arteriosa._ Spitting of arterial blood. Blood spit up from the\r\nlungs is florid, because it has just been exposed to the influence of the\r\nair in its passage through the extremities of the pulmonary artery; it is\r\nfrothy, from the admixture of air with it in the bronchia. The patients\r\nfrequently vomit at the same time from the disagreeable titillation of\r\nblood about the fauces; and are thence liable to believe, that the blood is\r\nrejected from the stomach.\r\n\r\nSometimes an hæmoptoe for several successive days returns in gouty persons\r\nwithout danger, and seems to supply the place of the gouty paroxysms. Is\r\nnot the liver always diseased previous to the hæmoptoe, as in several other\r\nhæmorrhages? See Class I. 2. 1. 9.\r\n\r\nM. M. Venesection, a purge, a blister, diluents, torpentia; and afterwards\r\nsorbentia, as the bark, the acid of vitriol, and opium. An emetic is said\r\nto stop a pulmonary hæmorrhage, which it may effect, as sickness decreases\r\nthe circulation, as is very evident in the great sickness sometimes\r\nproduced by too large a dose of digitalis purpurea.\r\n\r\nDr. Rush says, a table spoonful or two of common salt is successful in\r\nhæmoptoe; this may be owing to its stimulating the absorbent systems, both\r\nthe lymphatic, and the venous. Should the patient respire air with less\r\noxygen? or be made sick by whirling round in a chair suspended by a rope?\r\nOne immersion in cold water, or a sudden sprinkling all over with cold\r\nwater, would probably stop a pulmonary hæmorrhage. See Sect. XXVII. 1.\r\n\r\n5. _Hæmorrhagia narium._ _Epistaxis_. Bleeding at the nose in elderly\r\nsubjects most frequently attends those, whose livers are enlarged or\r\ninflamed by the too frequent use of fermented liquors.\r\n\r\nIn boys it occurs perhaps simply from redundancy of blood; and in young\r\ngirls sometimes precedes the approach of the catamenia; and then it shews a\r\ndisposition contrary to chlorosis; which arises from a deficiency of red\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nM. M. It is stopped by plunging the head into cold water, with powdered\r\nsalt hastily dissolved in it; or sometimes by lint strewed over with wheat\r\nflour put up the nostrils; or by a solution of steel in brandy applied to\r\nthe vessel by means of lint. The cure in other respects as in hæmoptoe;\r\nwhen the bleeding recurs at certain periods, after venesection, and\r\nevacuation by calomel, and a blister, the bark and steel must be given, as\r\nin intermittent fevers. See Section XXVII. 1.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nORDO I.\r\n\r\n_Increased Irritation._\r\n\r\nGENUS II.\r\n\r\n_With increased Actions of the Secerning System._\r\n\r\nThese are always attended with increase of partial or of general heat; for\r\nthe secreted fluids are not simply separated from the blood, but are new\r\ncombinations; as they did not previously exist as such in the blood\r\nvessels. But all new combinations give out heat chemically; hence the\r\norigin of animal heat, which is always increased in proportion to the\r\nsecretion of the part affected, or to the general quantity of the\r\nsecretions. Nevertheless there is reason to believe, that as we have a\r\nsense purposely to distinguish the presence of greater or less quantities\r\nof heat, as mentioned in Sect. XIV. 6. so we may have certain minute glands\r\nfor the secretion of this fluid, as the brain is believed to secrete the\r\nsensorial power, which would more easily account for the instantaneous\r\nproduction of the blush of shame, and of anger. This subject deserves\r\nfurther investigation.\r\n\r\nSPECIES.\r\n\r\n1. _Calor febrilis._ The heat in fevers arises from the increase of some\r\nsecretion, either of the natural fluids, as in irritative fevers; or of new\r\nfluids, as in infectious fevers; or of new vessels, as in inflammatory\r\nfevers. The pain of heat is a consequence of the increased extension or\r\ncontraction of the fibres exposed to so great a stimulus. See CLASS I. 1.\r\n5. 6.\r\n\r\n2. _Rubor febrilis._ Febrile redness. When the cold fit of fever\r\nterminates, and the pulsations of the heart and arteries become strong as\r\nwell as quick from the increase of their irritability after their late\r\nquiescence, the blood is impelled forwards into the fine extremities of the\r\narteries, and the anastomozing capillaries, quicker than the extremities of\r\nthe veins can absorb and return it to the heart. Hence the pulse at the\r\nwrist becomes full, as well as quick and strong, and the skin glows with\r\narterial blood, and the veins become empty and less visible.\r\n\r\nIn elderly people the force of the heart and arteries becomes less, while\r\nthe absorbent power of the veins remains the same; whence the capillary\r\nvessels part with the blood, as soon as it is received, and the skin in\r\nconsequence becomes paler; it is also probable, that in more advanced life\r\nsome of the finer branches of the arteries coalesce, and become impervious,\r\nand thus add to the opacity of the skin.\r\n\r\n3. _Sudor calidus._ Warm sweat may be divided into four varieties,\r\naccording to their remote causes. _First_, the perspirable matter is\r\nsecreted in as great quantity during the hot fit of fever, as towards the\r\nend of it, when the sweat is seen upon the skin. But during the hot fit the\r\ncutaneous absorbents act also with increased energy, and the exhalation is\r\nlikewise increased by the greater heat of the skin; and hence it does not\r\nappear in drops on the surface, but is in part reabsorbed, and in part\r\ndissipated in the atmosphere. But as the mouths of the cutaneous absorbents\r\nare exposed to the cool air or bedclothes; whilst those of the capillary\r\nglands, which secrete the perspirable matter, are exposed to the warmth of\r\nthe circulating blood; the former, as soon as the fever-fit begins to\r\ndecline, lose their increased action first; and hence the absorption of the\r\nsweat is diminished, whilst the increased secretion of it continues for\r\nsome hours afterwards, which occasions it to stand in drops upon the skin.\r\n\r\nAs the skin becomes cooler, the evaporation of the perspirable matter\r\nbecomes less, as well as the absorption of it. And hence the dissipation of\r\naqueous fluid from the body, and the consequent thirst, are perhaps greater\r\nduring the hot fit, than during the subsequent sweat. For the sweats do not\r\noccur, according to Dr. Alexander's experiments, till the skin is cooled\r\nfrom 112 to 108 degrees of heat; that is, till the paroxysm begins to\r\ndecline. From this it appears, that the sweats are not critical to the hot\r\nfit, any more than the hot fit can be called critical to the cold one; but\r\nsimply, that they are the natural consequence of the decline of the hot\r\nfit, commencing with the decreased action of the absorbent system, and the\r\ndecreased evaporation from the skin. And from hence it may be concluded,\r\nthat a fever-fit is not in general an effort of nature to restore health,\r\nas Sydenham considered it, but a necessary consequence of the previous\r\ntorpor; and that the causes of fevers would be less detrimental, if the\r\nfever itself could be prevented from existing; as appears in the cool\r\ntreatment of the small-pox.\r\n\r\nIt must be noted that the profuse sweats on the skin are more frequent at\r\nthe decline of fever-fits than the copious urine, or loose stools, which\r\nare mentioned below; as the cutaneous absorbents, being exposed to the cool\r\nair, lose their increased action sooner than the urinary or intestinal\r\nabsorbents; which open into the warm cavities of the bladder and\r\nintestines; but which are nevertheless often affected by their sympathy\r\nwith the cutaneous absorbents. Hence few fevers terminate without a\r\nmoisture of the skin; whence arose the fatal practice of forcing sweats by\r\nthe external warmth of air or bedclothes in fevers; for external warmth\r\nincreases the action of the cutaneous capillaries more than that of the\r\nother secerning vessels; because the latter are habituated to 98 degrees of\r\nheat, the internal warmth of the body; whereas the cutaneous capillaries\r\nbeing nearer the surface are habitually kept cooler by the contact of the\r\nexternal air. Sweats thus produced by heat in confined rooms are still more\r\ndetrimental; as the air becomes then not only deprived of a part of its\r\noxygene by frequent respiration, but is loaded with animal effluvia as well\r\nas with moisture, till it can receive no more; and in consequence, while\r\nthe cutaneous secretion stands upon the skin in drops for want of\r\nexhalation, the lungs are exposed to an insalubrious atmosphere.\r\n\r\nI do not deny, that sweating may be so managed as to be serviceable in\r\npreventing the return of the cold paroxysm of fevers; like the warm bath,\r\nor any other permanent stimulus, as wine, or opium, or the bark. For this\r\npurpose it should be continued till past the time of the expected cold fit,\r\nsupported by moderate doses of wine-whey, with spirit of hartshorn, and\r\nmoderate degrees of warmth. Its salutary effect, when thus managed, was\r\nprobably one cause of its having been so much attended to; and the fetid\r\nsmell, which when profuse is liable to accompany it, gave occasion to the\r\nbelief, that the supposed material cause of the disease was thus eliminated\r\nfrom the circulation.\r\n\r\nWhen too great external heat is applied, the system is weakened by excess\r\nof action, and the torpor which causes the cold paroxysm recurs sooner and\r\nmore violently. For though some stimuli, as of opium and alcohol, at the\r\nsame time that they exhaust the sensorial power by promoting increase of\r\nfibrous action, may also increase the production or secretion of it in the\r\nbrain, yet experience teaches us, that the exhaustion far out-balances the\r\nincreased production, as is evinced by the general debility, which succeeds\r\nintoxication.\r\n\r\nIn respect to the fetor attending copious continued sweats, it is owing to\r\nthe animalized part of this fluid being kept in that degree of warmth,\r\nwhich most favours putrefaction, and not suffered to exhale into the\r\natmosphere. Broth, or other animal mucus, kept in similar circumstances,\r\nwould in the same time acquire a putrid smell; yet has this error\r\nfrequently produced miliary eruptions, and increased every kind of\r\ninflammatory or sensitive fever.\r\n\r\nThe ease, which the patient experiences during sweating, if it be not\r\nproduced by much external heat, is similar to that of the warm bath; which\r\nby its stimulus applied to the cutaneous vessels, which are generally\r\ncooler than the internal parts of the system, excites them into greater\r\naction; and pleasureable sensation is the consequence of these increased\r\nactions of the vessels of the skin. From considering all these\r\ncircumstances, it appears that it is not the evacuation by sweats, but the\r\ncontinued stimulus, which causes and supports those sweats, which is\r\nserviceable in preventing the returns of fever-fits. And that sweats too\r\nlong continued, or induced by too great stimulus of warmth, clothes, or\r\nmedicines, greatly injure the patient by increasing inflammation, or by\r\nexhausting the sensorial power. See Class I. 1. 2. 14.\r\n\r\n_Secondly_, The sweats produced by exercise or labour are of the warm kind;\r\nas they originate from the increased action of the capillaries of the skin,\r\nowing to their being more powerfully stimulated by the greater velocity of\r\nthe blood, and by a greater quantity of it passing through them in a given\r\ntime. For the blood during violent exercise is carried forwards by the\r\naction of the muscles faster in the arteries, than it can be taken up by\r\nthe veins; as appears by the redness of the skin. And from the consequent\r\nsweats, it is evinced, that the secretory vessels of the skin during\r\nexercise pour out the perspirable matter faster, than the mouths of the\r\nabsorbent vessels can drink it up. Which mouths are not exposed to the\r\nincreased muscular action, or to the stimulus of the increased velocity and\r\nquantity of the blood, but to the cool air.\r\n\r\n_Thirdly_, the increased secretion of perspirable matter occasioned by the\r\nstimulus of external heat belongs likewise to this place; as it is caused\r\nby the increased motions of the capillary vessels; which thus separate from\r\nthe blood more perspirable matter, than the mouths of their correspondent\r\nabsorbent vessels can take up; though these also are stimulated by external\r\nheat into more energetic action. If the air be stationary, as in a small\r\nroom, or bed with closed curtains, the sweat stands in drops on the skin\r\nfor want of a quicker exhalation proportioned to the quicker secretion.\r\n\r\nA _fourth_ variety of warm perspiration is that occasioned by stimulating\r\ndrugs, of which opium and alcohol are the most powerful; and next to these\r\nthe spices, volatile alkali, and neutral salts, especially sea salt; that\r\nmuch of the aqueous part of the blood is dissipated by the use of these\r\ndrugs, is evinced by the great thirst, which occurs a few hours after the\r\nuse of them. See Art. III. 2. 12. and Art. III. 2. 1.\r\n\r\nWe may from hence understand, that the increase of this secretion of\r\nperspirable matter by artificial means, must be followed by debility and\r\nemaciation. When this is done by taking much salt, or salted meat, the\r\nsea-scurvy is produced; which consists in the inirritability of the\r\nbibulous terminations of the veins arising from the capillaries; see Class\r\nI. 2. 1. 14. The scrophula, or inirritability of the lymphatic glands,\r\nseems also to be occasionally induced by an excess in eating salt added to\r\nfood of bad nourishment. See Class I. 2. 3. 21. If an excess of\r\nperspiration is induced by warm or stimulant clothing, as by wearing\r\nflannel in contact with the skin in the summer months, a perpetual\r\nfebricula is excited, both by the preventing the access of cool air to the\r\nskin, and by perpetually goading it by the numerous and hard points of the\r\nends of the wool; which when applied to the tender skins of young children,\r\nfrequently produce the red gum, as it is called; and in grown people,\r\neither an erysipelas, or a miliary eruption, attended with fever. See Class\r\nII. 1. 3. 12.\r\n\r\nShirts made of cotton or calico stimulate the skin too much by the points\r\nof the fibres, though less than flannel; whence cotton handkerchiefs make\r\nthe nose sore by frequent use. The fibres of cotton are, I suppose, ten\r\ntimes shorter than those of flax, and the number of points in consequence\r\ntwenty times the number; and though the manufacturers singe their calicoes\r\non a red-hot iron cylinder, yet I have more than once seen an erysipelas\r\ninduced or increased by the stimulus of calico, as well as of flannel.\r\n\r\nThe increase of perspiration by heat either of clothes, or of fire,\r\ncontributes much to emaciate the body; as is well known to jockeys, who,\r\nwhen they are a stone or two too heavy for riding, find the quickest way to\r\nlessen their weight is by sweating themselves between blankets in a warm\r\nroom; but this likewise is a practice by no means to be recommended, as it\r\nweakens the system by the excess of so general a stimulus, brings on a\r\npremature old age, and shortens the span of life; as may be further deduced\r\nfrom the quick maturity, and shortness of the lives, of the inhabitants of\r\nHindostan, and other tropical climates.\r\n\r\nM. Buffon made a curious experiment to shew this circumstance. He took a\r\nnumerous brood of the butterflies of silkworms, some hundreds of which left\r\ntheir eggs on the same day and hour; these he divided into two parcels; and\r\nplacing one parcel in the south window, and the other in the north window\r\nof his house, he observed, that those in the colder situation lived many\r\ndays longer than those in the warmer one. From these observations it\r\nappears, that the wearing of flannel clothing next the skin, which is now\r\nso much in fashion, however useful it may be in the winter to those, who\r\nhave cold extremities, bad digestions, or habitual coughs, must greatly\r\ndebilitate them, if worn in the warm months, producing fevers, eruptions,\r\nand premature old age. See Sect. XXXVII. 5. Class I. 1. 2. 14. Art. III. 2.\r\n1.\r\n\r\n4. _Urina uberior colorata._ Copious coloured urine. Towards the end of\r\nfever-fits a large quantity of high coloured urine is voided, the kidneys\r\ncontinuing to act strongly, after the increased action of the absorbents of\r\nthe bladder is somewhat diminished. If the absorbents continue also to act\r\nstrongly, the urine is higher coloured, and so loaded as to deposit, when\r\ncool, an earthy sediment, erroneously thought to be the material cause of\r\nthe disease; but is simply owing to the secretion of the kidnies being\r\ngreat from their increased action; and the thinner parts of it being\r\nabsorbed by the increased action of the lymphatics, which are spread very\r\nthick on the neck of the bladder; for the urine, as well as perhaps all the\r\nother secreted fluids, is produced from the kidnies in a very dilute state;\r\nas appears in those, who from the stimulus of a stone, or other cause,\r\nevacuate their urine too frequently; which is then pale from its not having\r\nremained in the bladder long enough for the more aqueous part to have been\r\nreabsorbed. The general use of this urinary absorption to the animal\r\noeconomy is evinced from the urinary bladders of fish, which would\r\notherwise be unnecessary. High coloured urine in large quantity shews only,\r\nthat the secreting vessels of the kidnies, and the absorbents of the\r\nbladder, have acted with greater energy. When there is much earthy\r\nsediment, it shews, that the absorbents have acted proportionally stronger,\r\nand have consequently left the urine in a less dilute state. In this urine\r\nthe transparent sediment or cloud is mucous; the opake sediment is probably\r\ncoagulable lymph from the blood changed by an animal or chemical process.\r\nThe floating scum is oil. The angular concretions to the sides of the pot,\r\nformed as the urine cools, is microcosmic salt. Does the adhesive blue\r\nmatter on the sides of the glass, or the blue circle on it at the edge of\r\nthe upper surface of the urine, consist of Prussian blue?\r\n\r\n5. _Diarrhoea calida._ Warm diarrhoea. This species may be divided into\r\nthree varieties deduced from their remote causes, under the names of\r\ndiarrhoea febrilis, diarrhoea crapulosa, and diarrhoea infantum. The\r\nfebrile diarrhoea appears at the end of fever-fits, and is erroneously\r\ncalled critical, like the copious urine, and the sweats; whereas it arises\r\nfrom the increased action of those secerning organs, which pour their\r\nfluids into the intestinal canal (as the liver, pancreas, and mucous\r\nglands), continuing longer than the increased action of the intestinal\r\nabsorbents. In this diarrhoea there is no appearance of curdled chyle in\r\nthe stools, as occurs in cholera. I. 3. 1. 5.\r\n\r\nThe _diarrhoea crapulosa_, or diarrhoea from indigestion, occurs when too\r\ngreat a quantity of food or liquid has been taken; which not being\r\ncompleatly digested, stimulates the intestines like any other extraneous\r\nacrid material; and thus produces an increase of the secretions into them\r\nof mucus, pancreatic juice, and bile. When the contents of the bowels are\r\nstill more stimulant, as when drastic purges, or very putrescent diet, have\r\nbeen taken, a cholera is induced. See Sect. XXIX. 4.\r\n\r\nThe _diarrhoea infantum_, or diarrhoea of infants, is generally owing to\r\ntoo great acidity in their bowels. Milk is found curdled in the stomachs of\r\nall animals, old as well as young, and even of carnivorous ones, as of\r\nhawks. (Spallanzani.) And it is the gastric juice of the calf, which is\r\nemployed to curdle milk in the process of making cheese. Milk is the\r\nnatural food for children, and must curdle in their stomachs previous to\r\ndigestion; and as this curdling of the milk destroys a part of the acid\r\njuices of the stomach, there is no reason for discontinuing the use of it,\r\nthough it is occasionally ejected in a curdled state. A child of a week\r\nold, which had been taken from the breast of its dying mother, and had by\r\nsome uncommon error been suffered to take no food but water-gruel, became\r\nsick and griped in twenty-four hours, and was convulsed on the second day,\r\nand died on the third! When all young quadrupeds, as well as children, have\r\nthis natural food of milk prepared for them, the analogy is so strong in\r\nfavour of its salubrity, that a person should have powerful testimony\r\nindeed of its disagreeing, before he advises the discontinuance of the use\r\nof it to young children in health, and much more so in sickness. The\r\nfarmers lose many of their calves, which are brought up by gruel, or gruel\r\nand old milk; and among the poor children of Derby, who are thus fed,\r\nhundreds are starved into the scrophula, and either perish, or live in a\r\nstate of wretched debility.\r\n\r\nWhen young children are brought up without a breast, they should for the\r\nfirst two months have no food but new milk; since the addition of any kind\r\nof bread or flour is liable to ferment, and produce too much acidity; as\r\nappears by the consequent diarrhoea with green dejections and gripes; the\r\ncolour is owing to a mixture of acid with the natural quantity of bile, and\r\nthe pain to its stimulus. And they should never be fed as they lie upon\r\ntheir backs, as in that posture they are necessitated to swallow all that\r\nis put into their mouths; but when they are fed, as they are sitting up, or\r\nraised up, when they have had enough, they can permit the rest to run out\r\nof their mouths. This circumstance is of great importance to the health of\r\nthose children, who are reared by the spoon, since if too much food is\r\ngiven them, indigestion, and gripes, and diarrhoea, is the consequence; and\r\nif too little, they become emaciated; and of this exact quantity their own\r\npalates judge the best.\r\n\r\nM. M. In this last case of the diarrhoea of children, the food should be\r\nnew milk, which by curdling destroys part of the acid, which coagulates it.\r\nChalk about four grains every six hours, with one drop of spirit of\r\nhartshorn, and half a drop of laudanum. But a blister about the size of a\r\nshilling is of the greatest service by restoring the power of digestion.\r\nSee Article III. 2. 1. in the subsequent Materia Medica.\r\n\r\n6. _Salivatio calida._ Warm salivation. Increased secretion of saliva. This\r\nmay be effected either by stimulating the mouth of the gland by mercury\r\ntaken internally; or by stimulating the excretory duct of the gland by\r\npyrethrum, or tobacco; or simply by the movement of the muscles, which lie\r\nover the gland, as in masticating any tasteless substance, as a lock of\r\nwool, or mastic.\r\n\r\nIn about the middle of nervous fevers a great spitting of saliva sometimes\r\noccurs, which has been thought critical; but as it continues sometimes two\r\nor even three weeks without the relief of the patient, it may be concluded\r\nto arise from some accidental circumstance, perhaps not unsimilar to the\r\nhysteric ptyalisms mentioned in Class I. 3. 2. 2. See Sect. XXIV.\r\n\r\nM. M. Cool air, diluents, warm bath, evacuations.\r\n\r\n7. _Catharrhus calidus._ Warm catarrh. Consists in an increased secretion\r\nof mucus from the nostrils without inflammation. This disease, which is\r\ncalled a cold in the head, is frequently produced by cold air acting for\r\nsome time on the membranes, which line the nostrils, as it passes to the\r\nlungs in respiration. Whence a torpor of the action of the mucous glands is\r\nfirst introduced, as in I. 2. 3. 3. and an orgasm or increased action\r\nsucceeds in consequence. Afterwards this orgasm and torpor are liable to\r\nalternate with each other for some time like the cold and hot fits of ague,\r\nattended with deficient or exuberant secretion of mucus in the nostrils.\r\n\r\nAt other times it arises from reverse sympathy with some extensive parts of\r\nthe skin, which have been exposed too long to cold, as of the head, or\r\nfeet. In consequence of the torpor of these cutaneous capillaries those of\r\nthe mucous membrane of the nostrils act with greater energy by reverse\r\nsympathy; and thence secrete more mucus from the blood. At the same time\r\nthe absorbents, acting also with greater energy by their reverse sympathy\r\nwith those of some distant part of the skin, absorb the thinner parts of\r\nthe mucus more hastily; whence the mucus is both thicker and in greater\r\nquantity. Other curious circumstances attend this disease; the membrane\r\nbecomes at times so thickened by its increased action in secreting the\r\nmucus, that the patient cannot breathe through his nostrils. In this\r\nsituation if he warms his whole skin suddenly by fire or bed-clothes, or by\r\ndrinking warm tea, the increased action of the membrane ceases by its\r\nreverse sympathy with the skin; or by the retraction of the sensorial power\r\nto other parts of the system; and the patient can breathe again through the\r\nnostrils. The same sometimes occurs for a time on going into the cold air\r\nby the deduction of heat from the mucous membrane, and its consequent\r\ninactivity or torpor. Similar to this when the face and breast have been\r\nvery hot and red, previous to the eruption of the small-pox by inoculation,\r\nand that even when exposed to cool air, I have observed the feet have been\r\ncold; till on covering them with warm flannel, as the feet have become\r\nwarm, the face has cooled. See Sect. XXXV. 1. 3. Class II. 1. 3. 5. IV. 2.\r\n2. 10. IV. 1. 1. 5.\r\n\r\nM. M. Evacuations, abstinence, oil externally on the nose, warm diluent\r\nfluids, warm shoes, warm night-cap.\r\n\r\n8. _Expectoratio calida._ Warm expectoration consists of the increased\r\nsecretion of mucus from the membrane, which lines the bronchiæ, or\r\nair-cells of the lungs, without inflammation. This increased mucus is\r\nejected by the action of coughing, and is called a cold, and resembles the\r\ncatarrh of the preceding article; with which it is frequently combined.\r\n\r\nM. M. Inhale the steam of warm water, evacuations, warm bath, afterwards\r\nopium, sorbentia.\r\n\r\n9. _Exsudatio pone aures._ A discharge behind the ears. This chiefly\r\naffects children, and is a morbid secretion; as appears from its fetor; for\r\nif it was owing to defect of absorption, it would be saline, and not fetid;\r\nif a morbid action has continued a considerable time, it should not be\r\nstopped too suddenly; since in that case some other morbid action is liable\r\nto succeed in its stead. Thus children are believed to have had cholics, or\r\neven convulsions, consequent to the too sudden healing of these morbid\r\neffusions behind their ears. The rationale of this is to be explained from\r\na medical fact, which I have frequently observed; and that is, that a\r\nblister on the back greatly strengthens the power of digestion, and removes\r\nthe heart-burn in adults, and green stools in children. The stimulus of the\r\nblister produces sensation in the vessels of the skin; with this additional\r\nsensorial power these vessels act more strongly; and with these the vessels\r\nof the internal membranes of the stomach and bowels act with greater energy\r\nfrom their direct sympathy with them. Now the acrid discharge behind the\r\nears of children produces sensation on that part of the skin, and so far\r\nacts as a small blister. When this is suddenly stopped, a debility of the\r\ndigestive power of the stomach succeeds from the want of this accustomed\r\nstimulus, with flatulency, green stools, gripes, and sometimes consequent\r\nconvulsions. See Class II. 1. 5. 6. and II. 1. 4. 6.\r\n\r\nM. M. If the matter be absorbed, and produces swelling of the lymphatics of\r\nthe neck, it should be cured as soon as possible by dusting the part with\r\nwhite lead, cerussa, in very fine powder; and to prevent any ill\r\nconsequence an issue should be kept for about a month in the arm; or a\r\npurgative medicine should be taken, every other day for three or four\r\ntimes, which should consist of a grain of calomel, and three or four grains\r\nof rhubarb, and as much chalk. If there be no appearance of absorption, it\r\nis better only to keep the parts clean by washing them with warm water\r\nmorning and evening; or putting fuller's earth on them; especially till the\r\ntime of toothing is past. The tinea, or scald head, and a leprous eruption,\r\nwhich often appears behind the ears, are different diseases.\r\n\r\n10. _Gonorrhea calida._ Warm gleet. Increased discharge of mucus from the\r\nurethra or prostrate gland without venereal desire, or venereal infection.\r\nSee Class I. 2. 3. 8.\r\n\r\nM. M. Cantharides, balsams, rhubarb, blister in perinæum, cold bath,\r\ninjections of metallic salts, flannel shirt, change of the form of the\r\naccustomed chair or saddle of the patient.\r\n\r\n11. _Fluor albus calidus._ Warm fluor albus. Increased secretion of mucus\r\nin the vagina or uterus without venereal desire or venereal infection. It\r\nis distinguished from the fluor albus frigidus by the increased sense of\r\nwarmth in the part, and by the greater opacity or spissitude of the\r\nmaterial discharged; as the thinner parts are reabsorbed by the increased\r\naction of the absorbents, along with the saline part, whence no smarting or\r\nexcoriation attends it.\r\n\r\nM. M. Mucilage, as isinglass, hartshorn jelly, gum arabic. Ten grains of\r\nrhubarb every night. Callico or flannel shift, opium, balsams. See Class I.\r\n2. 3. 7.\r\n\r\n12. _Hæmorrhois alba._ White piles. An increased discharge of mucus from\r\nthe rectum frequently mistaken for matter; is said to continue a few weeks,\r\nand recur like the bleeding piles; and to obey lunar influence. See Class\r\nI. 2. 1. 6.\r\n\r\nM. M. Abstinence from vinous spirit. Balsam of copaiva. Spice swallowed in\r\nlarge fragments, as ten or fifteen black pepper-corns cut in half, and\r\ntaken after dinner and supper. Ward's paste, consisting of black pepper and\r\nthe powdered root of Helenium Enula.\r\n\r\n13. _Serum e vesicatorio._ Discharge from a blister. The excretory ducts of\r\nglands terminate in membranes, and are endued with great irritability, and\r\nmany of them with sensibility; the latter perhaps in consequence of their\r\nfacility of being excitable into great action; instances of this are the\r\nterminations of the gall-duct in the duodenum, and of the salivary and\r\nlachrymal glands in the mouth and eye; which produce a greater secretion of\r\ntheir adapted fluids, when the ends of their excretory ducts are\r\nstimulated.\r\n\r\nThe external skin consists of the excretory ducts of the capillaries, with\r\nthe mouths of the absorbents; when these are stimulated by the application\r\nof cantharides, or by a slice of the fresh root of bryonia alba bound on\r\nit, the capillary glands pour an increased quantity of fluid upon the skin\r\nby their increased action; and the absorbent vessels imbibe a greater\r\nquantity of the more fluid and saline part of it; whence a thick mucous or\r\nserous fluid is deposited between the skin and cuticle.\r\n\r\n14. _Perspiratio foetida._ Fetid perspiration. The uses of the perspirable\r\nmatter are to keep the skin soft and pliant, for the purposes of its easier\r\nflexibility during the activity of our limbs in locomotion, and for the\r\npreservation of the accuracy of the sense of touch, which is diffused under\r\nthe whole surface of it to guard us against the injuries of external\r\nbodies; in the same manner as the secretion of tears is designed to\r\npreserve the cornea of the eye moist, and in consequence transparent; yet\r\nhas this cutaneous mucus been believed by many to be an excrement; and I\r\nknow not how many fanciful theories have been built on its supposed\r\nobstruction. Such as the origin of catarrhs, coughs, inflammations,\r\nerysypelas, and herpes.\r\n\r\nTo all these it may be sufficient to answer, that the antient Grecians\r\noiled themselves all over; that some nations have painted themselves all\r\nover, as the Picts of this island; that the Hottentots smear themselves all\r\nover with grease. And lastly, that many of our own heads at this day are\r\ncovered with the flour of wheat and the fat of hogs, according to the\r\ntyranny of a filthy and wasteful fashion, and all this without\r\ninconvenience. To this must be added the strict analogy between the use of\r\nthe perspirable matter and the mucous fluids, which are poured for similar\r\npurposes upon all the internal membranes of the body; and besides its being\r\nin its natural state inodorous; which is not so with the other excretions\r\nof feces, or of urine.\r\n\r\nIn some constitutions the perspirable matter of the lungs acquires a\r\ndisagreeable odour; in others the axilla, and in others the feet, emit\r\ndisgustful effluvia; like the secretions of those glands, which have been\r\ncalled odoriferæ; as those, which contain the castor in the beaver, and\r\nthose within the rectum of dogs, the mucus of which has been supposed to\r\nguard them against the great costiveness, which they are liable to in hot\r\nsummers; and which has been thought to occasion canine madness, but which,\r\nlike their white excrement, is more probably owing to the deficient\r\nsecretion of bile. Whether these odoriferous particles attend the\r\nperspirable matter in consequence of the increased action of the capillary\r\nglands, and can properly be called excrementitous; that is, whether any\r\nthing is eliminated, which could be hurtful if retained; or whether they\r\nmay only contain some of the essential oil of the animal; like the smell,\r\nwhich adheres to one's hand on stroking the hides of some dogs; or like the\r\neffluvia, which is left upon the ground, from the feet of men and other\r\ncreatures; and is perceptible by the nicer organs of the dogs, which hunt\r\nthem, may admit of doubt.\r\n\r\nM. M. Wash the parts twice a day with soap and water; with lime water;\r\ncover the feet with oiled silk socks, which must be washed night and\r\nmorning. Cover them with charcoal recently made red hot, and beaten into\r\nfine powder and sifted, as soon as cold, and kept well corked in a bottle,\r\nto be warned off and renewed twice a day. Internally rhubarb grains vi. or\r\nviii. every night, so as to procure a stool or two extraordinary every day,\r\nand thus by increasing one evacuation to decrease another. Cool dress,\r\ndiluting liquids?\r\n\r\n15. _Crines novi._ New hairs. The black points on the faces of some people\r\nconsist of mucus, which is become viscid, and which adheres in the\r\nexcretory ducts of the glands of the skin; as described in Class I. 2. 2.\r\n9. and which may be pressed out by the fingers, and resembles little worms.\r\nSimilar to this would seem the fabrication of silk, and of cobweb by the\r\nsilk worm and spider; which is a secreted matter pressed through holes,\r\nwhich are the excretory ducts of glands. And it is probable, that the\r\nproduction of hair on many parts of the body, and at different periods of\r\nlife, may be effected by a similar process; and more especially as every\r\nhair may be considered as a slender flexible horn, and is an appendage of\r\nthe skin. See Sect. XXXIX. 3. 2. Now as there is a sensitive sympathy\r\nbetween the glands, which secrete the semen, and the throat, as appears in\r\nthe mumps; see Hydrophobia, Class IV. 1. 2. 7. and Parotitis, Class IV. 1.\r\n2. 19. The growth of the beard at puberty seems to be caused by the greater\r\naction of the cutaneous glands about the chin and pubes in consequence of\r\ntheir sympathy with those of the testes. But this does not occur to the\r\nfemale sex at their time of puberty, because the sensitive sympathy in them\r\nseems to exist between the submaxillary glands, and the pectoral ones;\r\nwhich secrete the milk, and afford pleasure both by that secretion, and by\r\nthe erection of the mamulæ, or nipples; and by delivering the milk into the\r\nmouth of the child; this sensitive sympathy of the pectoral and\r\nsubmaxillary glands in women is also observable in the Parotitis, or mumps,\r\nas above referred to.\r\n\r\nWhen hairs grow on the face or arms so as to be disagreeable, they may be\r\nthus readily removed without pain or any ill consequence. Warm the ends of\r\na pair of nippers or forceps, and stick on them a little rosin, or burgundy\r\npitch; by these means each single hair may be taken fast hold of; and if it\r\nbe then plucked off slowly, it gives pain; but if plucked off suddenly, it\r\ngives no pain at all; because the vis inertiæ of the part of the skin, to\r\nwhich it adheres, is not overcome; and it is not in consequence separated\r\nfrom the cellular membrane under it. Some of the hairs may return, which\r\nare thus plucked off, or others may be induced to grow near them; but in a\r\nlittle time they may be thus safely destroyed; which is much to be\r\npreferred to the methods said to be used in Turkey to eradicate hair; such\r\nas a mixture of orpiment and quick lime; or of liver of sulphur in\r\nsolution; which injure the skin, if they are not very nicely managed; and\r\nthe hair is liable to grow again as after shaving; or to become white, if\r\nthe roots of it have been much inflamed by the causticity of the\r\napplication. See Class I. 2. 2. 11. on grey hairs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nORDO I.\r\n\r\n_Increased Irritation._\r\n\r\nGENUS III.\r\n\r\n_With increased Actions of the Absorbent System._\r\n\r\nThese are not attended with so great increase of heat as in the former\r\ngenus, because the fluids probably undergo less chemical change in the\r\nglands of the absorbent system; nor are the glands of the absorbent vessels\r\nso numerous or so extensive as those of the secerning ones. Yet that some\r\nheat is produced by the increased action of the absorbents appears from the\r\ngreater general warmth of the skin and extremities of feeble patients after\r\nthe exhibition of the peruvian bark, and other medicines of the article\r\nSorbentia.\r\n\r\nSPECIES.\r\n\r\n1. _Lingua arida._ Dry tongue occurs in those fevers, where the expired air\r\nis warmer than natural; and happens to all those, who sleep with their\r\nmouths open; the currents of air in respiration increasing the evaporation.\r\nThere is also a dryness in the mouth from the increased action of the\r\nabsorbent vessels, when a sloe or a crab-apple are masticated; and after\r\nthe perforation has been much increased by eating salt or spice, or after\r\nother copious secretions; as after drunkenness, cathartics, or fever fits,\r\nthe mucus of the mouth becomes viscid, and in small quantity, from the\r\nincreased absorption, adhering to the tongue like a white slough. In the\r\ndiabætes, where the thirst is very great, this slough adheres more\r\npertinaciously, and becomes black or brown, being coloured after a few days\r\nby our aliment or drink. The inspissated mucus on the tongue of those, who\r\nsleep with their mouths open, is sometimes reddened as if mixed with blood,\r\nand sometimes a little blood follows the expuition of it from the fauces\r\nowing to its great adhesion. When this mucus adheres long to the papillæ of\r\nthe tongue, the saliva, which it contains in its interstices, like a\r\nsponge, is liable to become putrid, and to acquire a bitter taste, like\r\nother putrid animal substances; which is generally mistaken for an\r\nindication of the presence of bile.\r\n\r\nM. M. Warm subacid liquids. See Class I. 2. 5. 8.\r\n\r\n2. _Fauces aridæ._ Dry throat. The expuition of a frothy mucus with great\r\nand perpetual hawking occurs in hydrophobia, and is very distressing to the\r\npatient; which may be owing to the increased irritability or sensibility of\r\nthe upper part of the oesophagus, which will not permit any fluid to rest\r\non it.\r\n\r\nIt affects some people after intoxication, when the lungs remain slightly\r\ninflamed, and by the greater heat of the air in expiration the mucus\r\nbecomes too hastily evaporated, and is expectorated with difficulty in the\r\nstate of white froth.\r\n\r\nI knew a person, who for twenty years always waked with his tongue and\r\nthroat quite dry; so that he was necessitated to take a spoonful of water,\r\nas soon as he awoke; otherwise a little blood always followed the forcible\r\nexpuition of the indurated mucus from his fauces. See Class II. 1. 3. 17.\r\n\r\nM. M. Steel-springs fixed to the night-cap so as to suspend the lower jaw\r\nand keep it closed; or springs of elastic gum. Or a pot of water suspended\r\nover the bed, with a piece of list, or woollen cloth, depending from it,\r\nand held in the mouth; which will act like a syphon, and slowly supply\r\nmoisture, or barley water should be frequently syringed into the mouth of\r\nthe patient.\r\n\r\n3. _Nares aridi._ Dry nostrils with the mucus hardening upon their internal\r\nsurface, so as to cover them with a kind of skin or scale, owing to the\r\nincreased action of the absorbents of this membrane; or to the too great\r\ndryness of the air, which passes into the lungs; or too great heat of it in\r\nits expiration.\r\n\r\nWhen air is so dry as to lose its transparency; as when a tremulous motion\r\nof it can be seen over corn fields in a hot summer's day; or when a dry\r\nmist, or want of transparency of the air, is visible in very hot weather;\r\nthe sense of smell is at the same time imperfect from the dryness of the\r\nmembrane, beneath which it is spread.\r\n\r\n4. _Expectoratio solida._ Solid expectoration. The mucus of the lungs\r\nbecomes hardened by the increased absorption, so that it adheres and forms\r\na kind of lining in the air-cells, and is sometimes spit up in the form of\r\nbranching vessels, which are called polypi of the lungs. See Transact. of\r\nthe College, London. There is a rattling or weezing of the breath, but it\r\nis not at first attended with inflammation.\r\n\r\nThe Cynanche trachealis, or Croup, of Dr. Cullen, or Angina polyposa of\r\nMichaelis, if they differ from the peripneumony of infants, seem to belong\r\nto this genus. When the difficulty of respiration is great, venesection is\r\nimmediately necessary, and then an emetic, and a blister. And the child\r\nshould be kept nearly upright in bed as much as may be. See Tonsillitis,\r\nClass II. 1. 3. 3.\r\n\r\nM. M. Diluents, emetics, essence of antimony, foetid gums, onions, warm\r\nbath for half an hour every day for a month. Inhaling the steam of water,\r\nwith or without volatile alcali. Soap.\r\n\r\n5. _Constipatio alvi._ Costiveness from increased action of the intestinal\r\nabsorbents. The feces are hardened in lumps called scybala; which are\r\nsometimes obliged to be extracted from the rectum with a kind of marrow\r\nspoon. This is said to have happened from the patient having taken much\r\nrust of iron. The mucus is also hardened so as to line the intestines, and\r\nto come away in skins, rolled up as they pass along, so as to resemble\r\nworms, for which they are frequently mistaken; and sometimes it is\r\nevacuated in still larger pieces, so as to counterfeit the form of the\r\nintestines, and has been mistaken for a portion of them. Balls of this\r\nkind, nearly as heavy as marble, and considerably hard, from two inches to\r\nfive in diameter, are frequently found in the bowels of horses. Similar\r\nballs found in goats have been called Bezoar.\r\n\r\nM. M. Cathartics, Diluents, fruit, oil, soap, sulphur, warm bath.\r\nSprinkling with cold water, cool clothing. See Class I. 2. 4. 18.\r\n\r\n6. _Cutis arida._ Dry skin. This dry skin is not attended with coldness as\r\nin the beginning of fever-fits. Where this cutaneous absorption is great,\r\nand the secreted material upon it viscid, as on the hairy scalp, the skin\r\nbecomes covered with hardened mucus; which adheres so as not to be easily\r\nremoved, as the scurf on the head; but is not attended with inflammation\r\nlike the Tinea, or Lepra. The moisture, which appears on the skin beneath\r\nresinous or oily plasters, or which is seen to adhere to such plasters, is\r\nowing to their preventing the exhalation of the perspirable matter, and not\r\nto their increasing the production of it, as some have idly imagined.\r\n\r\nM. M. Warm bathing, oil externally, oil-skin gloves, resinous plasters.\r\nWax.\r\n\r\n7. _Urina parca colorata._ Diminished urine, which is high coloured, and\r\ndeposits an earthy sediment, when cold, is owing to the great action of the\r\nurinary absorbents. See Class I. 1. 2. 4. In some dropsies the cutaneous\r\nabsorbents are paralytic, as well as those opening into the cellular\r\nmembrane; and hence, no moisture being acquired from the atmosphere, or\r\nfrom the cellular membrane, great thirst is excited; and great absorption\r\nfrom all parts, where the absorbents are still capable of action. Hence the\r\nurine is in very small quantity, and of deep colour, with copious sediment;\r\nand the kidneys are erroneously blamed for not doing their office;\r\nstimulant diuretic medicines are given in vain; and very frequently the\r\nunhappy patient is restrained from quenching his thirst, and dies a martyr\r\nto false theory.\r\n\r\nM. M. Diluent liquids, and warm bathing, are the natural cure of this\r\nsymptom; but it generally attends those dropsies, which are seldom curable;\r\nas they are owing to a paralysis both of the cutaneous and cellular\r\nlymphatics.\r\n\r\n8. _Calculus felleus._ Gall-stone. From the too hasty absorption of the\r\nthinner parts of the bile, the remainder is left too viscid, and\r\ncrystallizes into lumps; which, if too large to pass, obstruct the ductus\r\ncholedochus, producing pain at the pit of the stomach, and jaundice. When\r\nthe indurated bile is not harder than a boiled pea, it may pass through the\r\nbile-duct with difficulty by changing its form; and thus gives those pains,\r\nwhich have been called spasms of the stomach; and yet these viscid lumps of\r\nbile may afterwards dissolve, and not be visible among the feces.\r\n\r\nIn two instances I have seen from thirty to fifty gall-stones voided after\r\ntaking an oil vomit as below. They were about the size of peas, and\r\ndistinguishable when dry by their being inflammable like bad wax, when put\r\ninto the flame of a candle. For other causes of jaundice, see Class I. 2.\r\n4. 19.\r\n\r\nM. M. Diluents, daily warm bathing. Ether mixed with yolk of egg and water.\r\nUnboiled acrid vegetables, as lettice, cabbage, mustard, and cresses. When\r\nin violent pain, four ounces of oil of olives, or of almonds, should be\r\nswallowed; and as much more in a quarter of an hour, whether it stays or\r\nnot. The patient should lie on the circumference of a large barrel, first\r\non one side, and then on the other. Electric shocks through the gall-duct.\r\nFactitious Selter's water made by dissolving one dram of Sal Soda in a pint\r\nof water; to half a pint of which made luke-warm add ten drops of marine\r\nacid; to be drank as soon as mixed, twice a day for some months. Opium must\r\nbe used to quiet the pain, if the oil does not succeed, as two grains, and\r\nanother grain in half an hour if necessary. See Class IV. 2. 2. 4.\r\n\r\n9. _Calculus renis._ Stone of the kidney. The pain in the loins and along\r\nthe course of the ureter from a stone is attended with retraction of the\r\ntesticle in men, and numbness on the inside of the thigh in women. It is\r\ndistinguished from the lumbago or sciatica, as these latter are seldom\r\nattended with vomiting, and have pain on the outside of the thigh,\r\nsometimes quite down to the ankle or heel. See Herpes and Nephritis.\r\n\r\nWhere the absorption of the thinner parts of the secretion takes place too\r\nhastily in the kidnies, the hardened mucus, and consequent calculous\r\nconcretions, sometimes totally stop up the tubuli uriniferi; and no urine\r\nis secreted. Of this many die, who have drank much vinous spirit, and some\r\nof them recover by voiding a quantity of white mucus, like chalk and water;\r\nand others by voiding a great quantity of sand, or small calculi. This\r\nhardened mucus frequently becomes the nucleus of a stone in the bladder.\r\nThe salts of the urine, called microcosmic salt, are often mistaken for\r\ngravel, but are distinguishable both by their angles of crystallization,\r\ntheir adhesion to the sides or bottom of the pot, and by their not being\r\nformed till the urine cools. Whereas the particles of gravel are generally\r\nwithout angles, and always drop to the bottom of the vessel, immediately as\r\nthe water is voided.\r\n\r\nThough the proximate cause of the formation of the calculous concretions of\r\nthe kidneys, and of chalk-stones in the gout, and of the insoluble\r\nconcretions of coagulable lymph, which are found on membranes, which have\r\nbeen inflamed in peripneumony, or rheumatism, consists in the too great\r\naction of the absorbent vessels of those parts; yet the remote cause in\r\nthese cases is probably owing to the inflammation of the membranes; which\r\nat that time are believed to secrete a material more liable to coagulate or\r\nconcrete, than they would otherwise produce by increased action alone\r\nwithout the production of new vessels, which constitutes inflammation. As\r\ndefined in Class II. 1. 2.\r\n\r\nThe fluids secreted from the mucous membranes of animals are of various\r\nkinds and consistencies. Hair, silk, scales, horns, fingernails, are owing\r\nto natural processes. Gall-stones, stones found in the intestines of\r\nhorses, scurf of the skin in leprosy, stones of the kidnies and bladder,\r\nthe callus from the inflamed periosteum, which unites broken bones, the\r\ncalcareous cement, which repairs the injured shells of snails, the\r\ncalcareous crust on the eggs of birds, the annually renewed shells of\r\ncrabs, are all instances of productions from mucous membranes, afterwards\r\nindurated by absorption of their thinner parts.\r\n\r\nAll these concretions contain phosphoric acid, mucus, and calcareous earth\r\nin different proportions; and are probably so far analogous in respect to\r\ntheir component parts as well as their mode of formation. Some calcareous\r\nearth has been discovered after putrefaction in the coagulable lymph of\r\nanimals. Fordyce's Elements of Practice. A little calcareous earth was\r\ndetected by Scheel or Bergman in the calculus of the bladder with much\r\nphosphoric acid, and a great quantity of phosphoric acid is shewn to exist\r\nin oyster-shells by their becoming luminous on exposing them a while to the\r\nsun's light after calcination; as in the experiments of Wilson. Botanic\r\nGarden, P. 1. Canto 1. l. 182, note. The exchange of which phosphoric acid\r\nfor carbonic acid, or fixed air, converts shells into limestone, producing\r\nmountains of marble, or calcareous strata.\r\n\r\nNow as the hard lumps of calcareous matter, termed crabs' eyes, which are\r\nfound in the stomachs of those animals previous to the annual renewal of\r\ntheir shells, are redissolved, probably by their gastric acid, and again\r\ndeposited for that purpose; may it not be concluded, that the stone of the\r\nbladder might be dissolved by the gastric juice of fish of prey, as of\r\ncrabs, or pike; or of voracious young birds, as young rooks or hawks, or\r\neven of calves? Could not these experiments be tried by collecting the\r\ngastric juice by putting bits of sponge down the throats of young crows,\r\nand retracting them by a string in the manner of Spallanzani? or putting\r\npieces of calculus down the throat of a living crow, or pike, and observing\r\nif they become digested? and lastly could not gastric juice, if it should\r\nappear to be a solvent, be injected and born in the bladder without injury\r\nby means of catheters of elastic resin, or caoutchouc?\r\n\r\nM. M. Diluents. Cool dress. Frequent change of posture. Frequent horizontal\r\nrest in the day. Bathe the loins every morning with a sponge and cold\r\nwater. Aerated alcaline water internally. Abstinence from all fermented or\r\nspirituous liquors. Whatever increases perspiration injures these patients,\r\nas it dissipates the aqueous particles, which ought to dilute the urine.\r\nWhen the constitution begins to produce gravel, it may I believe be\r\ncertainly prevented by a total abstinence from fermented or spirituous\r\nliquors; by drinking much aqueous fluids; as toast and water, tea, milk and\r\nwater, lemonade; and lastly by thin clothing, and sleeping on a hardish\r\nbed, that the patient may not lie too long on one side. See Class IV. 2. 2.\r\n2. There is reason to believe, that the daily use of opium contributes to\r\nproduce gravel in the kidnies by increasing absorption, when they are\r\ninflamed; in the same manner as is done by fermented or spirituous liquor.\r\nSee Class I. 3. 2. 11.\r\n\r\nWhen the kidnies are so obstructed with gravel, that no urine passes into\r\nthe bladder; which is known by the external appearance of the lower part of\r\nthe abdomen, which, when the bladder is full, seems as if contracted by a\r\ncord between the navel and the bladder; and by the tension on the region of\r\nthe bladder distinguishable by the touch; or by the introduction of the\r\ncatheter; the following methods of cure are frequently successful.\r\nVenesection to six or eight ounces, ten grains of calomel, and an infusion\r\nof senna with salts and oil, every three hours, till stools are procured.\r\nThen an emetic. After the patient has been thus evacuated, a blister on the\r\nloins should be used; and from ten to twenty electric shocks should be\r\npassed through the kidnies, as large as can be easily borne, once or twice\r\na day. Along with this method the warm bath should be used for an hour once\r\nor twice a day. After repeated evacuations a clyster, consisting of two\r\ndrams of turpentine dissolved by yolk of egg, and sixty drops of tincture\r\nof opium, should be used at night, and repeated, with cathartic medicines\r\ninterposed, every night, or alternate nights. Aerated solution of alcali\r\nshould be taken internally, and balsam of copaiva, three or four times a\r\nday. Some of these patients recover after having made no water for nine or\r\nten days.\r\n\r\nIf a stone sticks in the ureter with incessant vomiting, ten grains of\r\ncalomel must be given in small pills as above; and some hours afterwards\r\ninfusion of senna and salts and oil, if it can be made to stay on the\r\nstomach. And after the purge has operated four or five times, an opiate is\r\nto be given, if the pain continues, consisting of two grains of opium. If\r\nthis does not succeed, ten or twenty electric shocks through the kidney\r\nshould be tried, and the purgative repeated, and afterwards the opiate. The\r\npatient should be frequently put into the warm bath for an hour at a time.\r\nEighty or an hundred drops of laudanum given in a glyster, with two drams\r\nof turpentine, is to be preferred to the two grains given by the stomach as\r\nabove, when the pain and vomiting are very urgent.\r\n\r\n10. _Calculus vesicæ._ Stone of the bladder. The nucleus, or kernel, of\r\nthese concretions is always formed in the kidney, as above described; and\r\npassing down the ureter into the bladder, is there perpetually increased by\r\nthe mucus and salts secreted from the arterial system, or by the mucus of\r\nthe bladder, disposed in concentric strata. The stones found in the bowels\r\nof horses are also formed on a nucleus, and consist of concentric spheres;\r\nas appears in sawing them through the middle. But as these are formed by\r\nthe indurated mucus of the intestines alone without the urinary salts, it\r\nis probable a difference would be found on their analysis.\r\n\r\nAs the stones of the bladder are of various degrees of hardness, and\r\nprobably differ from each other in the proportions at least of their\r\ncomponent parts; when a patient, who labours under this afflicting disease,\r\nvoids any small bits of gravel; these should be kept in warm solutions of\r\ncaustic alcali, or of mild alcali well aerated; and if they dissolve in\r\nthese solutions, it would afford greater hopes, that that which remains in\r\nthe bladder, might be affected by these medicines taken by the stomach, or\r\ninjected into the bladder.\r\n\r\nTo prevent the increase of a stone in the bladder much diluent drink should\r\nbe taken; as half a pint of water warmed to about eighty degrees, three or\r\nfour times a day: which will not only prevent the growth of it, by\r\npreventing any microcosmic salts from being precipitated from the urine,\r\nand by keeping the mucus suspended in it; but will also diminish the stone\r\nalready formed, by softening, and washing away its surface. To this must be\r\nadded cool dress, and cool bed-clothes, as directed above in the calculus\r\nrenis.\r\n\r\nWhen the stone is pushed against or into the neck of the bladder, great\r\npain is produced; this may sometimes be relieved by the introduction of a\r\nbougie to push the stone back into the fundus of the bladder. Sometimes by\r\nchange of posture, or by an opiate either taken into the stomach, or by a\r\nclyster.\r\n\r\nA dram of sal soda, or of salt of tartar, dissolved in a pint of water, and\r\nwell saturated with carbonic acid (fixed air), by means of Dr. Nooth's\r\nglass-apparatus, and drank every day, or twice a day, is the most\r\nefficacious internal medicine yet discovered, which can be easily taken\r\nwithout any general injury to the constitution. An aerated alcaline water\r\nof this kind is sold under the name of factitious Seltzer water, by J.\r\nSchweppe, at N^o 8, King's-street, Holborn, London; which I am told is\r\nbetter prepared than can be easily done in the usual glass-vessels,\r\nprobably by employing a greater pressure in wooden ones.\r\n\r\nLythotomy is the last recourse. Will the gastric juice of animals dissolve\r\ncalculi? Will fermenting vegetable juices, as sweet-wort, or sugar and\r\nwater in the act of fermentation with yest, dissolve any kind of animal\r\nconcretions?\r\n\r\n11. _Calculus arthriticus._ Gout-stones are formed on inflamed membranes,\r\nlike those of the kidnies above described, by the too hasty absorption of\r\nthe thinner and saline parts of the mucus. Similar concretions have been\r\nproduced in the lungs, and even in the pericardium; and it is probable,\r\nthat the ossification, as it is called, of the minute arteries, which is\r\nsaid to attend old age, and to precede some mortifications of the\r\nextremities, may be a process of this kind.\r\n\r\nAs gout-stones lie near the surface, it is probable, that ether, frequently\r\napplied in their early state, might render them so liquid as to permit\r\ntheir reabsorption; which the stimulus of the ether might at the same time\r\nencourage.\r\n\r\n12. _Rheumatismus chronicus._ Chronic rheumatism. After the acute\r\nrheumatism some inspissated mucus, or material similar to chalk-stones of\r\nthe gout, which was secreted on the inflamed membrane, is probably left,\r\nowing to the too hasty absorption of the thinner and saline part of it; and\r\nby lying on the fascia, which covers some of the muscles, pains them, when\r\nthey move and rub against it, like any extraneous material.\r\n\r\nThe pain of the shoulder, which attends inflammations of the upper membrane\r\nof the liver, and the pains of the arms, which attend asthma dolorificum,\r\nor dropsy of the pericardium, are distinguished from the chronic\r\nrheumatism, as in the latter the pain only occurs on moving the affected\r\nmuscles.\r\n\r\nM. M. Warm bath, cold bath, bandage of emplastrum de minio put on tight, so\r\nas to compress the part. Cover the part with flannel. With oiled silk. Rub\r\nit with common oil frequently. With ether. A blister. A warmer climate.\r\nVenesection. A grain of calomel and a grain of opium for ten successive\r\nnights. The Peruvian bark.\r\n\r\n13. _Cicatrix vulnerum._ The scar after wounds. In the healing of ulcers\r\nthe matter is first thickened by increasing the absorption in them; and\r\nthen lessened, till all the matter is absorbed, which is brought by the\r\narteries, instead of being deposed in the ulcer.\r\n\r\nM. M. This is promoted by bandage, by the sorbentia externally, as powder\r\nof bark, white lead; solution of sugar of lead. And by the sorbentia\r\ninternally after evacuations. See Sect. XXXIII. 3. 2.\r\n\r\nIn those ulcers, which are made by the contact of external fire, the\r\nviolent action of the fibres, which occasions the pain, is liable to\r\ncontinue, after the external heat is withdrawn. This should be relieved by\r\nexternal cold, as of snow, salt and water recently mixed, ether, or spirits\r\nof wine suffered to evaporate on the part.\r\n\r\nThe cicatrix of an ulcer generally proceeds from the edges of it; but in\r\nlarge ones frequently from the middle, or commences in several places at\r\nthe same time; which probably contributes to the unevenness of large scars.\r\n\r\n14. _Corneæ obfuscatio._ Opacity of the cornea. There are few people, who\r\nhave passed the middle of life, who have not at some time suffered some\r\nslight scratches or injuries of the cornea, which by not healing with a\r\nperfectly smooth surface, occasion some refractions of light, which may be\r\nconveniently seen in the following manner: fill a tea-saucer with cream and\r\ntea, or with milk, and holding it to your lips, as if going to drink it,\r\nthe imperfections of the cornea will appear like lines or blotches on the\r\nsurface of the fluid, with a less white appearance than that surface. Those\r\nblemishes of the eye are distinguished from the muscæ volitantes described\r\nin Class I. 2. 5. 3. by their being invariably seen at any time, when you\r\nlook for them.\r\n\r\nUlcers may frequently be seen on the cornea after ophthalmy, like little\r\npits or indentations beneath the surface of it: in this case no external\r\napplication should be used, lest the scar should be left uneven; but the\r\ncure should be confined to the internal use of thirty grains of bark twice\r\na day, and from five to ten drops of laudanum at night, with five grains of\r\nrhubarb, if necessary.\r\n\r\nAfter ulcers of the cornea, which have been large, the inequalities and\r\nopacity of the cicatrix obscures the sight; in this case could not a small\r\npiece of the cornea be cut out by a kind of trephine about the size of a\r\nthick bristle, or a small crow-quill, and would it not heal with a\r\ntransparent scar? This experiment is worth trying, and might be done by a\r\npiece of hollow steel wire with a sharp edge, through which might be\r\nintroduced a pointed steel screw; the screw to be introduced through the\r\nopake cornea to hold it up, and press it against the cutting edge of the\r\nhollow wire or cylinder; if the scar should heal without losing its\r\ntransparency, many blind people might be made to see tolerably well by this\r\nslight and not painful operation. An experiment I wish strongly to\r\nrecommend to some ingenious surgeon or oculist.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nORDO I.\r\n\r\n_Increased Irritation._\r\n\r\nGENUS IV.\r\n\r\n_With increased Actions of other Cavities and Membranes._\r\n\r\nSPECIES.\r\n\r\n1. _Nictitatio irritativa._ Winking of the eyes is performed every minute\r\nwithout our attention, for the purpose of cleaning and moistening the\r\neye-ball; as further spoken of in Class II. 1. 1. 8. When the cornea\r\nbecomes too dry, it becomes at the same time less transparent; which is\r\nowing to the pores of it being then too large, so that the particles of\r\nlight are refracted by the edges of each pore, instead of passing through\r\nit; in the same manner as light is refracted by passing near the edge of a\r\nknife. When these pores are filled with water, the cornea becomes again\r\ntransparent. This want of transparency of the cornea is visible sometimes\r\nin dying people, owing to their inirritability, and consequent neglect of\r\nnictitation.\r\n\r\nThe increase of transparency by filling the pores with fluid is seen by\r\nsoaking white paper in oil; which from an opake body becomes very\r\ntransparent, and accounts for a curious atmospheric phenomenon; when there\r\nexists a dry mist in a morning so as to render distant objects less\r\ndistinct, it is a sign of a dry day; when distant objects are seen very\r\ndistinct, it is a sign of rain. See Botan. Garden, Part I. add. note xxv.\r\nThe particles of air are probably larger than those of water, as water will\r\npass through leather and paper, which will confine air; hence when the\r\natmosphere is much deprived of moisture, the pores of the dry air are so\r\nlarge, that the rays of light are refracted by their edges instead of\r\npassing through them. But when as much moisture is added as can be\r\nperfectly dissolved, the air becomes transparent; and opake again, when a\r\npart of this moisture collects into small spherules previous to its\r\nprecipitation. This also accounts for the want of transparency of the air,\r\nwhich is seen in tremulous motions over corn-fields on hot summer-days, or\r\nover brick-kilns, after the flame is extinguished, while the furnace still\r\nremains hot.\r\n\r\n2. _Deglutitio irritativa._ The deglutition of our saliva is performed\r\nfrequently without our attention, and is then an irritative action in\r\nconsequence of the stimulus of it in the mouth. Or perhaps sometimes for\r\nthe purpose of diffusing a part of it over the dry membranes of the fauces\r\nand pharinx; in the same manner as tears are diffused over the cornea of\r\nthe eye by the act of nictitation to clean or moisten it.\r\n\r\n3. _Respiratio et Tussis irritativæ._ In the acts of respiration and of\r\ncoughing there is an increased motion of the air-cells of the lungs owing\r\nto some stimulating cause, as described above in Class I. 1. 2. 8. and I.\r\n1. 3. 4. and which are frequently performed without our attention or\r\nconsciousness, and are then irritative actions; and thus differ from those\r\ndescribed in Class II. 1. 1. 2. and 5. To these increased actions of the\r\nair-cells are superadded those of the intercostal muscles and diaphragm by\r\nirritative association. When any unnatural stimulus acts so violently on\r\nthe organs of respiration as to induce pain, the sensorial power of\r\nsensation becomes added to that of irritation, and inflammation of the\r\nmembranes of them is a general consequence.\r\n\r\n4. _Exclusio bilis._ The exclusion of the bile from the gall-bladder, and\r\nits derivation into the duodenum, is an irritative action in consequence of\r\nthe stimulus of the aliment on the extremity of the biliary duct, which\r\nterminates in the intestine. The increased secretion of tears is occasioned\r\nin a similar manner by any stimulating material in the eyes; which affects\r\nthe excretory ducts of the lacrymal glands. A pain of the external membrane\r\nof the eye sometimes attends any unusual stimulus of it, then the sensorial\r\npower of sensation becomes added to that of irritation, and a superficial\r\ninflammation is induced.\r\n\r\n5. _Dentitio._ Toothing. The pain of toothing often begins much earlier\r\nthan is suspected; and is liable to produce convulsions; which are\r\nsometimes relieved, when the gum swells, and becomes inflamed; at other\r\ntimes a diarrhoea supervenes, which is generally esteemed a favourable\r\ncircumstance, and seems to prevent the convulsions by supplying another\r\nmeans of relieving the pain of dentition by irritative exertion; and a\r\nconsequent temporary exhaustion of sensorial power. See Class I. 1. 2. 5.\r\nSect. XXXV. 2. 1.\r\n\r\nThe convulsions from toothing generally commence long before the appearance\r\nof the teeth; but as the two middle incisors of the lower jaw generally\r\nappear first, and then those of the upper, it is adviseable to lance the\r\ngums over these longitudinally in respect to the jaw-bones, and quite down\r\nto the periosteum, and through it.\r\n\r\nAs the convulsions attending the commencement of toothing are not only\r\ndangerous to life in their greatest degree, but are liable to induce stupor\r\nor insensibility by their continuance even in a less degree, the most\r\nefficacious means should be used to cure them.\r\n\r\nM. M. Lance the gum of the expected teeth quite through the periosteum\r\nlongitudinally. Venesection by the lancet or by two or three leeches. One\r\ngrain of calomel as a purge. Tincture of jalap, five or six drops in water\r\nevery three hours til it purges, to be repeated daily. After evacuations a\r\nsmall blister on the back or behind the ears. And lastly, two or three\r\ndrops of laudanum according to the age of the child. Warm bath. See Class\r\nIII. 1. 1. 5. and 6.\r\n\r\n6. _Priapismus chronicus._ I have seen two cases, where an erection of the\r\npenis, as hard as horn, continued two or three weeks without any venereal\r\ndesires, but not without some pain; the easiest attitude of the patients\r\nwas lying upon their backs with their knees up. At length the corpus\r\ncavernosum urethræ became soft, and in another day or two the whole\r\nsubsided. In one of them a bougie was introduced, hoping to remove some bit\r\nof gravel from the caput gallinaginis, camphor, warm bathing, opium,\r\nlime-water, cold aspersion, bleeding in the veins of the penis, were tried\r\nin vain. One of them had been a free drinker, had much gutta rosacea on his\r\nface, and died suddenly a few months after his recovery from this\r\ncomplaint. Was it a paralysis of the terminations of the veins, which\r\nabsorb the blood from the tumid penis? or from the stimulus of indurated\r\nsemen in the seminal vessels? In the latter case some venereal desires\r\nshould have attended. Class III. 1. 2. 16.\r\n\r\nThe priapismus, which occurs to vigorous people in a morning before they\r\nawake, has been called the signum salutis, or banner of health, and is\r\noccasioned by the increase of our irritability or sensibility during sleep,\r\nas explained in Sect. XVIII. 15.\r\n\r\n7. _Distentio mamularum._ The distention of the nipples of lactescent women\r\nis at first owing to the stimulus of the milk. See Sect. XIV. 8. and Sect.\r\nXVI. 5. See Class II. 1. 7. 10.\r\n\r\n8. _Descensus uteri._ This is a very frequent complaint after bad labours,\r\nthe fundus uteri becomes inverted and descends like the prolapsus ani.\r\n\r\nM. M. All the usual pessaries are very inconvenient and ineffectual. A\r\npiece of soft sponge about two inches diameter introduced into the vagina\r\ngives great ease to these patients, and supports the uterus; it should have\r\na string put through it to retract it by.\r\n\r\nThere are also pessaries now made of elastic gum, which are said to be\r\neasily worn, and to be convenient, from their having a perforation in their\r\ncentre.\r\n\r\n9. _Prolapsus ani._ The lower part of the rectum becomes inverted, and\r\ndescends after every stool chiefly in children; and thus stimulates the\r\nsphincter ani like any other extraneous body.\r\n\r\nM. M. It should be dusted over with very fine powder of gum sandarach, and\r\nthen replaced. Astringent fomentations; as an infusion of oak-bark, or a\r\nslight solution of alum. Horizontal rest frequently in the day.\r\n\r\n10. _Lumbricus._ Round worm. The round worm is suspected in children when\r\nthe belly is tumid, and the countenance bloated and pale, with swelling of\r\nthe upper lip. The generation of these worms is promoted by the too dilute\r\nstate of the bile, as is evident in the fleuke-worm found in the biliary\r\nducts and substance of the liver in sheep; and in water-rats, in the livers\r\nof which last animals they were lately detected in large numbers by Dr.\r\nCapelle. Transactions of the college at Philadelphia, v. i.\r\n\r\nNow as the dilute state of the bile depends on the deficiency of the\r\nabsorption of its thinner parts, it appears, that the tumid belly, and\r\nbloated countenance, and swelled upper lip, are a concomitant circumstance\r\nattending the general inactivity of the absorbent system; which is\r\ntherefore to be esteemed the remote cause of the generation of worms.\r\n\r\nThe simplicity of the structure of worms probably enables them to exist in\r\nmore various temperatures of heat; and their being endued with life\r\nprevents them from being destroyed by digestion in the stomach, probably in\r\nthe same manner as the powers of life prevent the fermentation and\r\nputrefaction of the stomach itself. Hence I conclude, that worms are\r\noriginally taken into our alimentary canal from without; as I believe\r\nsimilar worms of all kinds are to be found out of the body.\r\n\r\nM. M. The round worm is destroyed by a cathartic with four or six grains of\r\ncalomel; and afterwards by giving six or eight grains of filings of iron\r\ntwice a day for a fortnight. See Hepatis tumor, Class I. 2. 3. 9. As worms\r\nare liable to come away in fevers, whether of the hectic or putrid kind,\r\ncould they be removed by purulent matter, or rotten egg, or putrid flesh,\r\nsince in those fevers from the enfeebled action of the intestines the fæces\r\nbecome highly putrid?\r\n\r\n11. _Tænia._ Tape-worm consists of a chain of animals extending from the\r\nstomach to the anus. See Sect. XXXIX. 2. 3. It frequently exists in cats,\r\nrats, and geese, and probably in many other animals.\r\n\r\nThe worms of this genus possess a wonderful power of retaining life. Two of\r\nthem, which were voided by a pointer dog in consequence of violent\r\npurgatives, each of which were several feet in length, had boiling water\r\npoured on them in a bason; which seemed not much to inconvenience them.\r\nWhen the water was cool, they were taken out and put into gin or whiskey of\r\nthe strongest kind, in which their life and activity continued unimpaired;\r\nand they were at length killed by adding to the spirit a quantity of\r\ncorrosive sublimate. Medic. Comment. for 1791, p. 370.\r\n\r\nThe tape-worm is cured by an amalgama of tin and quicksilver, such as is\r\nused on the back of looking-glasses; an ounce should be taken every two\r\nhours, till a pound is taken; and then a brisk cathartic of Glauber's salt\r\ntwo ounces, and common salts one ounce, dissolved in two wine pints of\r\nwater, half a pint to be taken every hour till it purges. The worm extends\r\nfrom the stomach to the anus, and the amalgama tears it from the intestine\r\nby mechanical pressure, acting upon it the whole way. Electric shocks\r\nthrough the duodenum greatly assists the operation. Large doses of tin in\r\npowder. Iron filings in large doses. The powder of fern-root seems to be of\r\nno use, as recommended by M. Noufflier.\r\n\r\n12. _Ascarides._ Thread-worms. These worms are said to be more frequent in\r\nsome parts of this kingdom than in others, as near the fens of\r\nLincolnshire. Do they escape from the body and become flies, like the\r\nbott-worm in horses? Do they crawl from one child to another in the same\r\nbed? Are they acquired from flies or worms, which are seen in putrid\r\nnecessary houses, as these worms as well as the tapeworms, are probably\r\nacquired from without? this may account for their re-appearance a few weeks\r\nor months after they have been destroyed; or can this happen from the eggs\r\nor parts of them remaining?\r\n\r\nAscarides appear to be of two kinds, the common small ones like a thread;\r\nwhich has a very sharp head, as appears in the microscope; and which is so\r\ntender, that the cold air soon renders it motionless; and a larger kind\r\nabove an inch long, and nearly as thick as a very small crow-quill, and\r\nwhich is very hard in respect to its texture, and very tenacious of life.\r\nOne of these last was brought to me, and was immediately immersed in a\r\nstrong solution of sugar of lead, and lived in it a very long time without\r\napparent inconvenience.\r\n\r\nM. M. Ascarides are said to be weakened by twenty grains of cinnabar and\r\nfive of rhubarb taken every night, but not to be cured by this process. As\r\nthese worms are found only in the rectum, variety of clysters have been\r\nrecommended. I was informed of a case, where solutions of mercurial\r\nointment were used as a clyster every night for a month without success.\r\nClysters of Harrowgate water are recomended, either of the natural, or of\r\nthe factitious, as described below, which might have a greater proportion\r\nof liver of sulphur in it. As the cold air soon destroys them, after they\r\nare voided, could clysters of iced water be used with advantage? or of\r\nspirit of wine and water? or of ether and water? Might not a piece of\r\ncandle, about an inch long, or two such pieces, smeared with mercurial\r\nointment, and introduced into the anus at night, or twice a day, be\r\neffectual by compressing their nidus, as well as by the poison of the\r\nmercury.\r\n\r\nThe clysters should be large in quantity, that they may pass high in the\r\nrectum, as two drams of tobacco boiled a minute in a pint of water. Or\r\nperhaps what might be still more efficacious and less inconvenient, the\r\nsmoke of tobacco injected by a proper apparatus every night, or alternate\r\nnights, for six or eight weeks. This was long since recommended, I think by\r\nMr. Turner of Liverpool; and the reason it has not succeeded, I believe to\r\nhave been owing to the imperfections of the joints of the common apparatus\r\nfor injecting the smoke of tobacco, so that it did not pass into the\r\nintestine, though it was supposed to do so, as I once observed. The smoke\r\nshould be received from the apparatus into a large bladder; and it may then\r\nbe certainly injected like the common clyster with sufficient force;\r\notherwise oiled leathers should be nicely put round the joints of the\r\nmachine; and a wet cloth round the injecting pipe to prevent the return of\r\nthe smoke by the sides of it. Clysters of carbonated hydrogen gas, or of\r\nother factitious airs, might be tried.\r\n\r\nHarrowgate water taken into the stomach, so as to induce six or seven\r\nstools every morning, for four or six weeks, is perhaps the most\r\nefficacious method in common use. A factitious Harrowgate water may be made\r\nprobably of greater efficacy than the natural, by dissolving one ounce of\r\nmarine salt, (called bay salt) and half an ounce of magnesia Glauber's\r\nsalt, (called Epsom salt, or bitter purging salt) in twenty-eight ounces of\r\nwater. A quarter or half a pint of this is to be taken every hour, or two\r\nhours in the morning, till it operates, with a tea-spoonful of a solution\r\nof liver of sulphur, which is to be made by putting an ounce of hepar\r\nsulphuris into half a pint of water. See Class IV. 1. 2. 9.\r\n\r\n13. _Dracunculus._ A thin worm brought from the coast of Guinea. It is\r\nfound in the interstices of the muscles, and is many yards long; it makes a\r\nsmall ulcer; which is cured by extracting an inch of the worm a day, and\r\nwrapping the extracted part slowly round a bit of tobacco pipe till next\r\nday, so as not to break it. I have twice seen long worms, like a thick\r\nhorse-hair, in water in July in this country, which appeared hard and\r\njointed.\r\n\r\n14. _Morpiones._ Crab-lice. The excrement of this animal stains the linen,\r\nand appears like diluted blood.\r\n\r\nM. M. Spirit of wine. Mercurial ointment, shaving the part. Oil destroys\r\nother insects, if they be quite covered with it, as the ticks on dogs, and\r\nwould probably therefore destroy these. Its manner of operation is by\r\nstopping up or filling their spiracula, or breathing pores; a few drops of\r\noil poured on a wasp, so as to cover it, destroys it in a few seconds.\r\n\r\n15. _Pediculi._ Lice. There is said to be a disease, in which these animals\r\nare propagated in indestructible numbers, so as to destroy the patient.\r\n\r\nM. M. Cleanliness, mercurial ointment, stavis acria in powder, or the\r\ntincture of it in spirit of wine. Spirit of wine alone? Bath of oil?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nORDO I.\r\n\r\n_Increased Irritation._\r\n\r\nGENUS V.\r\n\r\n_With Increased Actions of the Organs of Sense._\r\n\r\nSPECIES.\r\n\r\n1. _Visus acrior._ Acuter sight. There have been instances of people, who\r\ncould see better in the gloom of the evening, than in the stronger light of\r\nthe day; like owls, and bats, and many quadrupeds, and flying insects. When\r\nthe eye is inflamed, great light becomes eminently painful, owing to the\r\nincreased irritative motions of the retina, and the consequent increased\r\nsensation. Thus when the eye is dazzled with sudden light, the pain is not\r\nowing to the motion of the iris; for it is the contraction of the iris,\r\nwhich relieves the pain from sudden light; but to the too violent\r\ncontractions of the moving fibres, which constitute the extremities of the\r\noptic nerve.\r\n\r\n2. _Auditus acrior._ The irritative ideas of hearing are so increased in\r\nenergy as to excite our attention. This happens in some diseases of the\r\nepileptic kind, and in some fevers. Hence the whispering of the currents of\r\nair in a room, the respiration of the company, and noises before\r\nunperceived, become troublesome; and sounds louder than usual, or\r\nunexpected, produce starting, and convulsions.\r\n\r\nM. M. Put oil of almonds into the ears. Stop the meatus auditorius with\r\ncotton wool. Set the feet of the patient's bed on cushions, or suspend it\r\nby cords from the ceiling.\r\n\r\n3. _Olfactus acrior._ The irritative ideas of smell from the increased\r\naction of the olfactive nerve excite our attention. Hence common odours are\r\ndisagreeable; and are perceived from variety of objects, which were before\r\nthought inodorous. These are commonly believed to be hallucinations of the\r\nsense.\r\n\r\nM. M. Snuff starch up the nostrils.\r\n\r\n4. _Gustus acrior._ The irritative ideas of taste, as of our own saliva,\r\nand even of the atmospheric air, excite our attention; and common tastes\r\nare disagreeably strong.\r\n\r\nM. M. Water. Mucilage. Vegetable acids. Scrape the tongue clean. Rub it\r\nwith a sage-leaf and vinegar.\r\n\r\n5. _Tactus acrior._ The irritative ideas of the nerves of touch excite our\r\nattention: hence our own pressure on the parts, we rest upon, becomes\r\nuneasy with universal soreness.\r\n\r\nM. M. Soft feather-bed. Combed wool put under the patients, which rolls\r\nunder them, as they turn, and thus prevents their friction against the\r\nsheets. Drawers of soft leather. Plasters of cerate with calamy.\r\n\r\n6. _Sensus caloris acrior._ Acuter sense of heat occurs in some diseases,\r\nand that even when the perceptible heat does not appear greater than\r\nnatural to the hand of another person. See Class I. 1. 2. See Sect. XIV. 8.\r\nAll the above increased actions of our organs of sense separately or\r\njointly accompany some fevers, and some epileptic diseases; the patients\r\ncomplaining of the perception of the least light, noises in their ears, bad\r\nsmells in the room, and bad tastes in their mouths, with soreness,\r\nnumbness, and other uneasy feels, and with disagreeable sensations of\r\ngeneral or partial heat.\r\n\r\n7. _Sensus extensionis acrior._ Acuter sense of extension. The sense of\r\nextension was spoken of in Sect. XIV. 7. and XXXII. 4. The defect of\r\ndistention in the arterial system is accompanied with faintness; and its\r\nexcess with sensations of fulness, or weight, or pressure. This however\r\nrefers only to the vascular muscles, which are distended by their\r\nappropriated fluids; but the longitudinal muscles are also affected by\r\ndifferent quantities of extension, and become violently painful by the\r\nexcess of it.\r\n\r\nThese pains of muscles and of membranes are generally divided into acute\r\nand dull pains. The former are generally owing to increase of extension, as\r\nin pricking the skin with a needle; and the latter generally to defect of\r\nextension, as in cold head-aches; but if the edge of a knife, or point of a\r\npin, be gradually pressed against the fibres of muscles or membranes, there\r\nwould seem to be three states or stages of this extension of the fibres;\r\nwhich have acquired names according to the degree or kind of sensation\r\nproduced by the extension of them; these are 1. titillation or tickling. 2.\r\nitching, and the 3. smarting; as described below. See Sect. XIV. 9.\r\n\r\n8. _Titillatio._ Tickling is a pleasureable pain of the sense of extension\r\nabove mentioned, and therefore excites laughter; as described in Sect.\r\nXXXIV. 1. 4. The tickling of the nostrils, which precedes the efforts of\r\nsneezing, is owing to the increased irritation occasioned by external\r\nstimulus; and is attended with a pleasureable sensation in consequence of\r\nthe increased action of the part. When this action is exerted in a greater\r\ndegree, the sensation becomes painful, and the convulsion of sneezing\r\nensues; as the pain in tickling the soles of the feet of children is\r\nrelieved by laughter.\r\n\r\nA lady after a bruise on her nose by a fall was affected with incessant\r\nsneezing, and relieved by snuffing starch up her nostrils. Perpetual\r\nsneezings in the measles, and in catarrhs from cold, are owing to the\r\nstimulus of the saline part of the mucous effusion on the membrane of the\r\nnostrils. See Class II. 1. 1. 3.\r\n\r\n9. _Pruritus._ Itching seems to be a greater degree of titillation, and to\r\nbe owing to the stimulus of some acrid material, as the matter of the itch;\r\nor of the herpes on the scrotum, and about the anus; or from those\r\nuniversal eruptions, which attend some elderly people, who have drank much\r\nvinous spirit. It occurs also, when inflammations are declining, as in the\r\nhealing of blisters, or in the cure of ophthalmia, as the action of the\r\nvessels is yet so great as to produce sensation; which, like the\r\ntitillations that occasion laughter, is perpetually changing from pleasure\r\nto pain.\r\n\r\nWhen the natural efforts of scratching do not relieve the pain of itching,\r\nit sometimes increases so as to induce convulsions and madness. As in the\r\nfuror uterinus, and satyriasis, and in the sphincter ani and scrotum. See\r\nClass II. 1. 4. 14. IV. 2. 2. 6.\r\n\r\nM. M. Warm bath. Fomentation. Alcohol externally. Poultice. Oiled silk.\r\nMercurial ointments on small surfaces at once. See Class II. 1. 4. 12.\r\nSolutions of lead on small surfaces at once.\r\n\r\n10. _Dolor urens._ Smarting follows the edge of a knife in making a wound,\r\nand seems to be owing to the distention of a part of a fibre, till it\r\nbreaks. A smarting of the skin is liable to affect the scars left by herpes\r\nor shingles; and the callous parts of the bottoms of the feet; and around\r\nthe bases of corns on the toes; and frequently extends after sciatica along\r\nthe outside of the thigh, and of the leg, and part of the foot. All these\r\nmay be owing to the stimulus of extension, by blood or serum being forced\r\ninto vessels nearly coalesced.\r\n\r\nM. M. Emplastrum de minio put like a bandage on the part. Warm fomentation.\r\nOil and camphor rubbed on the part. Oil-silk covering. A blister on the\r\npart. Ether, or alcohol, suffered to evaporate on the part.\r\n\r\n11. _Consternatio._ Surprise. As our eyes acquaint us at the same time with\r\nless than half of the objects, which surround us, we have learned to\r\nconfide much in the organ of hearing to warn us of approaching dangers.\r\nHence it happens, that if any sound strikes us, which we cannot immediately\r\naccount for, our fears are instantly alarmed. Thus in great debility of\r\nbody, the loud clapping of a door, or the fall of a fire-shovel, produces\r\nalarm, and sometimes even convulsions; the same occurs from unexpected\r\nsights, and in the dark from unexpected objects of touch.\r\n\r\nIn these cases the irritability is less than natural, though it is\r\nerroneously supposed to be greater; and the mind is busied in exciting a\r\ntrain of ideas inattentive to external objects; when this train of ideas is\r\ndissevered by any unexpected stimulus, surprise is excited; as explained in\r\nSect. XVII. 3. 7. and XVIII. 17. then as the sensibility in these cases is\r\ngreater, fear becomes superadded to the surprise; and convulsions in\r\nconsequence of the pain of fear. See Sect. XIX. 2.\r\n\r\nThe proximate cause of surprise is the increased irritation induced by some\r\nviolent stimulus, which dissevers our usual trains of ideas; but in\r\ndiseases of inirritability the frequent starting or surprise from sounds\r\nnot uncommon, but rather louder than usual, as the clapping of a door,\r\nshews, that the attention of the patient to a train of sensitive ideas was\r\npreviously stronger than natural, and indicates an incipient delirium;\r\nwhich is therefore worth attending to in febrile diseases.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nORDO II.\r\n\r\n_Decreased Irritation._\r\n\r\nGENUS I.\r\n\r\n_With decreased Action of the Sanguiferous System._\r\n\r\nThe reader should be here apprized, that the words strength and debility,\r\nwhen applied to animal motions, may properly express the quantity of\r\nresistance such motions may overcome; but that, when they are applied to\r\nmean the susceptibility or insusceptibility of animal fibres to motion,\r\nthey become metaphorical terms; as in Sect. XII. 2. 1. and would be better\r\nexpressed by the words activity and inactivity.\r\n\r\nThere are three sources of animal inactivity; first, the defect of the\r\nnatural quantity of stimulus on those fibres, which have been accustomed to\r\nperpetual stimulus; as the arterial and secerning systems. When their\r\naccustomed stimulus is for a while intermitted, as when snow is applied to\r\nthe skin of the hands, an accumulation of sensorial power is produced; and\r\nthen a degree of stimulus, as of heat, somewhat greater than that at\r\npresent applied, though much less than the natural quantity, excites the\r\nvessels of the skin into violent action. We must observe, that a deficiency\r\nof stimulus in those fibres, which are not subject to perpetual stimulus,\r\nas the locomotive muscles, is not succeeded by accumulation of sensorial\r\npower; these therefore are more liable to become permanently inactive after\r\na diminution of stimulus; as in strokes of the palsy, this may be called\r\ninactivity from defect of stimulus.\r\n\r\n2. A second source of animal inactivity exists, when the sensorial power in\r\nany part of the system has been previously exhausted by violent stimuli; as\r\nthe eyes after long exposure to great light; or the stomach, to repeated\r\nspirituous potation; this may be termed inactivity from exhaustion of\r\nsensorial power. See Sect. XII. 2. 1.\r\n\r\n3. But there is a third source of inactivity owing to the deficient\r\nproduction of sensorial power in the brain; and hence stimuli stronger than\r\nnatural are required to produce the accustomed motions of the arterial\r\nsystem; in this case there is no accumulation of sensorial power produced;\r\nas in the inactivity owing to defect of stimulus; nor any previous\r\nexhaustion of it, as in the inactivity owing to excess of stimulus.\r\n\r\nThis third kind of inactivity causes many of the diseases of this genus;\r\nwhich are therefore in general to be remedied by such medicines as promote\r\na greater production of sensorial power in the brain; as the incitantia,\r\nconsisting of wine, beer, and opium, in small repeated quantities; and\r\nsecondly of such as simply stimulate the arterial and glandular system into\r\ntheir natural actions; as small repeated blisters, spices, and essential\r\noils. And lastly the sorbentia, which contribute to supply the more\r\npermanent strength of the system, by promoting the absorption of\r\nnourishment from the stomach, and intestines; and of the superfluous fluid,\r\nwhich attends the secretions.\r\n\r\nSPECIES.\r\n\r\n1. _Febris inirritativa._ Inirritative fever. This is the typhus mitior, or\r\nnervous fever of some writers; it is attended with weak pulse without\r\ninflammation, or symptoms of putridity, as they have been called. When the\r\nproduction of sensorial power in the brain is less than usual, the pulse\r\nbecomes quick as well as weak; and the heart sometimes trembles like the\r\nlimbs of old age, or of enfeebled drunkards; and when this force of the\r\ncontractions of the heart and arteries is diminished, the blood is pushed\r\non with less energy, as well as in less quantity, and thence its stimulus\r\non their sides is diminished in a duplicate ratio. In compressions of the\r\nbrain, as in apoplexy, the pulse becomes slower and fuller; for in that\r\ndisease, as in natural sleep, the irritative motions of the heart and\r\narteries are not diminished, volition alone is suspended or destroyed.\r\n\r\nIf the absorption of the terminations of the veins is not equally impaired\r\nwith the force of the heart and arteries, the blood is taken up by the\r\nveins the instant it arrives at their extremities; the capillary vessels\r\nare left empty, and there is less resistance to the current of the blood\r\nfrom the arteries; hence the pulse becomes empty, as well as weak and\r\nquick; the veins of the skin are fuller than the arteries of it; and its\r\nappearance becomes pale, bluish, and shrunk. See Class II. 1. 3. 1.\r\n\r\nWhen this pulse persists many hours, it constitutes the febris\r\ninirritativa, or typhus, or nervous fever, of some writers; it is attended\r\nwith little heat, the urine is generally of a natural colour, though in\r\nless quantity; with great prostration of strength, and much disturbance of\r\nthe faculties of the mind. Its immediate cause seems to be a deficient\r\nsecretion of the sensorial power from the inaction of the brain; hence\r\nalmost the whole of the sensorial power is expended in the performance of\r\nthe motions necessary to life, and little of it can be spared for the\r\nvoluntary actions of the locomotive muscles, or organs of sense, see Class\r\nI. 2. 5. 3. Its more remote cause may be from a paralysis or death of some\r\nother part of the body; as of the spleen, when a tumour is felt on the left\r\nside, as in some intermittents; or of the kidnies, when the urine continues\r\npale and in small quantity. Does the revivescence of these affected parts,\r\nor their torpor, recurring at intervals, form the paroxysms of these\r\nfevers? and their permanent revivescence establish the cure? See Class IV.\r\n2. 1. 19.\r\n\r\nM. M. Wine and opium in small quantities repeated every three hours\r\nalternately; small repeated blisters; warm but fresh air; sorbentia;\r\nnutrientia; transfusion of blood. Small electric shocks passed through the\r\nbrain in all directions. Oxygene air?\r\n\r\n2. _Paresis inirritativa._ Inirritative debility. A defective action of the\r\nirritative motions without increase of the frequency of the pulse. It\r\ncontinues three or four weeks like a fever, and then either terminates in\r\nhealth, or the patient sinks into one kind of apoplexy, and perishes. Many\r\nsymptoms, which attend inirritative fevers, accompany this disease, as cold\r\nhands and feet at periodic times, scurf on the tongue, want of appetite,\r\nmuddy urine, with pains of the head, and sometimes vertigo, and vomiting.\r\n\r\nThis disease differs from the inirritative fever by the pulse not being\r\nmore frequent than in health. The want of appetite and of digestion is a\r\nprincipal symptom, and probably is the cause of the universal debility,\r\nwhich may be occasioned by the want of nourishment. The vertigo is a\r\nsymptom of inirritability, as shewn in Class IV. 2. 1. 16. the muddy urine\r\nis owing to increased absorption from the bladder in consequence of the\r\ndiminished cutaneous and cellular absorption, as in anasarca, explained in\r\nSect. XXIX. 5. 1. and is therefore a consequence of the inirritability of\r\nthat part of the system; the foul tongue is owing to an increased\r\nabsorption of the thinner part of the mucus in consequence of the general\r\ndeficiency of fluid, which should be absorbed by the skin and stomach. The\r\nsickness is owing to decreased action of the stomach, which is probably the\r\nprimary disease, and is connected with the vertigo.\r\n\r\nM. M. An emetic. Calomel, grains iv. once or twice. Then a blister.\r\nPeruvian bark. Valerian. Columbo. Steel. Opium and wine in small\r\nquantities, repeated alternately every three hours. Small electric\r\npercussions through the stomach.\r\n\r\n3. _Somnus interruptus._ Interrupted sleep. In some fevers, where the\r\ninirritability is very great, when the patient falls asleep, the pulse in a\r\nfew minutes becomes irregular, and the patient awakes in great disorder,\r\nand fear of dying, refusing to sleep again from the terror of this uneasy\r\nsensation. In this extreme debility there is reason to believe, that some\r\nvoluntary power during our waking hours is employed to aid the irritative\r\nstimuli in carrying on the circulation of the blood through the lungs; in\r\nthe same manner as we use voluntary exertions, when we listen to weak\r\nsounds, or wish to view an object by a small light; in sleep volition is\r\nsuspended, and the deficient irritation alone is not sufficient to carry on\r\nthe pulmonary circulation. This explanation seems the most probable one,\r\nbecause in cases of apoplexy the irritative motions of the arterial system\r\ndo not seem to be impaired, nor in common sleep. See Incubus III. 2. 1. 13.\r\n\r\nM. M. Opium in very small doses, as three drops of laudanum. A person\r\nshould watch the patient, and awaken him frequently; or he should measure\r\nthe time between slumber and slumber by a stop-watch, and awaken the\r\npatient a little before he would otherwise awake; or he should keep his\r\nfinger on the pulse, and should forcibly awaken him, as soon as it becomes\r\nirregular, before the disorder of the circulation becomes so great as to\r\ndisturb him. See Class I. 2. 1. 9. and Sect. XXVII. 2.\r\n\r\n4. _Syncope._ Fainting consists in the decreased action of the arterial\r\nsystem; which is sometimes occasioned by defect of the stimulus of\r\ndistention, as after venesection, or tapping for the dropsy. At other times\r\nit arises from great emotions of the mind, as in sudden joy or grief. In\r\nthese cases the whole sensorial power is exerted on these interesting\r\nideas, and becomes exhausted. Thus during great surprise or fear the heart\r\nstops for a time, and then proceeds with throbbing and agitation; and\r\nsometimes the vital motions become so deranged, as never to recover their\r\nnatural successive action; as when children have been frightened into\r\nconvulsions. See Sect. XII. 7. 1.\r\n\r\nMiss ----, a young lady of Stafford, in travelling in a chaise was so\r\naffected by seeing the fall of a horse and postillion, in going down a\r\nhill, though the carriage was not overturned, that she fainted away, and\r\nthen became convulsed, and never spoke afterwards; though she lived about\r\nthree days in successive convulsions and stupor.\r\n\r\n5. _Hæmorrhagia venosa._ A bleeding from the capillaries arising from\r\ndefect of venous absorption, as in some of those fevers commonly termed\r\nputrid. When the blood stagnates in the cellular membrane, it produces\r\npetechiæ from this torpor or paralysis of the absorbent mouths of the\r\nveins. It must be observed, that those people who have diseased livers, are\r\nmore liable to this kind of hæmorrhages, as well as to the hæmorrhagia\r\narteriosa; the former, because patients with diseased livers are more\r\nsubject to paralytic complaints in general, as to hemiplegia, and to\r\ndropsy, which is a paralysis of the lymphatics; and the latter is probably\r\nowing to the delay of the circulation in the vena porta by the torpor of\r\nthis hepatic vessel, when the liver is not much enlarged; and to its\r\npressure on the vena cava, when it is much enlarged.\r\n\r\nM. M. Vitriolic acid, opium, steel, bark. Sponge bound on the part. Steel\r\ndissolved in spirit of wine externally. Flour.\r\n\r\n6. _Hæmorrhois cruenta._ In the bleeding piles the capillary vessels of the\r\nrectum become distended and painful from the defect of the venous\r\nabsorption of the part, and at length burst; or the mucous glands are so\r\ndilated as to give a passage to the blood; it is said to observe lunar\r\nperiods.\r\n\r\nM. M. Venesection, poultices, cathartics, spice, cold bath, and sorbentia.\r\nExternal compression by applying lint, sponge, or cotton. Internal\r\ncompression by applying a bit of candle smeared with mercurial ointment.\r\nStrangulate the tumid piles with a silk string. Cut them off. See Class I.\r\n2. 3. 22.\r\n\r\nMrs. ---- had for twelve or fifteen years, at intervals of a year or less,\r\na bleeding from the rectum without pain; which however stopped\r\nspontaneously after she became weakened, or by the use of injections of\r\nbrandy and water. Lately the bleeding continued above two months, in the\r\nquantity of many ounces a day, till she became pale and feeble to an\r\nalarming degree. Injections of solutions of lead, of bark and salt of\r\nsteel, and of turpentine, with some internal astringents, and opiates, were\r\nused in vain. An injection of the smoke of tobacco, with ten grains of\r\nopium mixed with the tobacco, was used, but without effect the two first\r\ntimes on account of the imperfection of the machine; on the third time it\r\nproduced great sickness, and vertigo, and nearly a fainting fit; from which\r\ntime the blood entirely stopped. Was this owing to a fungous excrescence in\r\nthe rectum; or to a blood-vessel being burst from the difficulty of the\r\nblood passing through the vena porta from some hepatic obstruction, and\r\nwhich had continued to bleed so long? Was it stopped at last by the\r\nfainting fit? or by the stimulus of the tobacco?\r\n\r\n7. _Hæmorrhagia renum._ Hæmorrhage from the kidnies, when attended with no\r\npain, is owing to defect of venous absorption in the kidney. When attended\r\nwith pain on motion, it is owing to a bit of gravel in the ureter or pelvis\r\nof the kidney; which is a much more frequent disease than the former. See\r\nSect. XXVII. 1.\r\n\r\nM. M. 1. Venesection in small quantity, calomel, bark, steel, an opiate;\r\ncold immersion up to the navel, the upper part of the body being kept\r\ncloathed. Neville-Holt water. 2. Alcalized water aerated. Much diluent\r\nliquids. Cool dress. Cool bed-room.\r\n\r\nCows are much subject to bloody urine, called foul water by the farmers; in\r\nthis disease about sixty grains of opium with or without as much rust of\r\niron, given twice a day, in a ball mixed with flour and water, or dissolved\r\nin warm water, or warm ale, is, I believe, an efficacious remedy, to which\r\nhowever should be added about two quarts of barley or oats twice a day, and\r\na cover at night, if the weather be cold.\r\n\r\n8. _Hæmorrhagia Hepatis._ Hæmorrhage from the liver. It sometimes happens\r\nin those, who have the gutta rosea, or paralytic affections owing to\r\ndiseased livers induced by the potation of fermented liquors, that a great\r\ndischarge of black viscid blood occasionally comes away by stool, and\r\nsometimes by vomiting: this the ancients called Melancholia, black bile. If\r\nit was bile, a small quantity of it would become yellow or green on\r\ndilution with warm water, which was not the case in one experiment which I\r\ntried; it must remain some time in the intestines from its black colour,\r\nwhen it passes downwards, and probably comes from the bile-ducts, and is\r\noften a fatal symptom. When it is evacuated by vomiting it is less\r\ndangerous, because it shews greater remaining irritability of the\r\nintestinal canal, and is sometimes salutary to those who have diseased\r\nlivers.\r\n\r\nM. M. An emetic. Rhubarb, steel, wine, bark.\r\n\r\n9. _Hæmoptoe venosa._ Venous hæmoptoe frequently attends the beginning of\r\nthe hereditary consumptions of dark-eyed people; and in others, whose lungs\r\nhave too little irritability. These spittings of blood are generally in\r\nvery small quantity, as a tea-spoonful; and return at first periodically,\r\nas about once a month; and are less dangerous in the female than in the\r\nmale sex; as in the former they are often relieved by the natural periods\r\nof the menses. Many of these patients are attacked with this pulmonary\r\nhæmorrhage in their first sleep; because in feeble people the power of\r\nvolition is necessary, besides that of irritation, to carry on respiration\r\nperfectly; but, as volition is suspended during sleep, a part of the blood\r\nis delayed in the vessels of the lungs, and in consequence effused, and the\r\npatient awakes from the disagreeable sensation. See Class I. 2. 1. 3. II.\r\n1. 6. 6. III. 2. 1. 10.\r\n\r\nM. M. Wake the patient every two or three hours by an alarum clock. Give\r\nhalf a grain of opium at going to bed, or twice a day. Onions, garlic,\r\nslight chalybeates. Issues. Leeches applied once a fortnight or month to\r\nthe hemorrhoidal veins to produce a new habit. Emetics after each period of\r\nhæmoptoe, to promote expectoration, and dislodge any effused blood, which\r\nmight by remaining in the lungs produce ulcers by its putridity. A hard\r\nbed, to prevent too sound sleep. A periodical emetic or cathartic once a\r\nfortnight.\r\n\r\n10. _Palpitatio cordis._ The palpitation of the heart frequently attends\r\nthe hæmoptoe above mentioned; and consists in an ineffectual exertion of\r\nthe heart to push forwards its contents in due time, and with due force.\r\nThe remote cause is frequently some impediment to the general circulation;\r\nas the torpor of the capillaries in cold paroxysms of fever, or great\r\nadhesions of the lungs. At other times it arises from the debility of the\r\naction of the heart owing to the deficient sensorial power of irritation or\r\nof association, as at the approach of death.\r\n\r\nIn both these cases of weak exertion the heart feels large to the touch, as\r\nit does not completely empty itself at each contraction; and on that\r\naccount contracts more frequently, as described in Sect. XXXII. 2. 2.\r\nAnother kind of palpitation may sometimes arise from the retrograde motions\r\nof the heart, as in fear. See Class I. 3. 1. 2. and IV. 3. 1. 6.\r\n\r\n11. _Menorrhagia._ Continued flow of the catamenia. The monthly effusion of\r\nblood from the uterus or vagina is owing to a torpor of the veins of those\r\nmembranes in consequence of the defect of venereal stimulus; and in this\r\nrespect resembles the mucus discharged in the periodical venereal orgasm of\r\nthe female quadrupeds, which are secluded from the males. The menorrhagia,\r\nor continued flow of this discharge, is owing to a continued defect of the\r\nvenous absorption of the membranes of the uterus or vagina. See Class IV.\r\n2. 4. 7.\r\n\r\nM. M. Venesection in small quantity. A cathartic. Then opium, a grain every\r\nnight. Steel. Bark. A blister. Topical aspersion with cold water, or cold\r\nvinegar.\r\n\r\n12. _Dysmenorrhagia._ A difficulty of menstruation attended with pain. In\r\nthis complaint the torpor of the uterine vessels, which precedes\r\nmenstruation, is by sympathy accompanied with a torpor of the lumbar\r\nmembranes, and consequent pain; and frequently with cold extremities, and\r\ngeneral debility. The small quantity and difficulty of the discharge is\r\nowing to arterial inactivity, as in chlorosis. Whence it happens, that\r\nchalybeate medicines are of efficacy both to stop or prevent too great\r\nmenstruation, and to promote or increase deficient menstruation; as the\r\nformer is owing to inirritability of the veins, and the latter of the\r\narteries of the uterus. See Article IV. 2. 6. in the Materia Medica.\r\n\r\nM. M. Opium, steel, pediluvium. Warm bath.\r\n\r\n13. _Lochia nimia._ Too great discharge after delivery. In that unnatural\r\npractice of some hasty accoucheurs of introducing the hand into the uterus\r\nimmediately after the delivery of the child, and forcibly bringing away the\r\nplacenta, it frequently happens, that a part of it is left behind; and the\r\nuterus, not having power to exclude so small a portion of it, is prevented\r\nfrom complete contraction, and a great hæmorrhage ensues. In this\r\ncircumstance a bandage with a thick compress on the lower part of the\r\nbelly, by appressing the sides of the uterus on the remaining part of the\r\nplacenta, is likely to check the hæmorrhage, like the application of a\r\npledget of any soft substance on a bleeding vessel.\r\n\r\nIn other cases the lochia continues too long, or in too great quantity,\r\nowing to the deficiency of venous absorption.\r\n\r\nM. M. An enema. An opiate. A blister. Slight chalybeates. Peruvian bark.\r\nClothes dipped in cold vinegar and applied externally. Bandages on the\r\nlimbs to keep more blood in them for a time have been recommended.\r\n\r\n14. _Abortio spontanea._ Some delicate ladies are perpetually liable to\r\nspontaneous abortion, before the third, or after the seventh, month of\r\ngestation. From some of these patients I have learnt, that they have\r\nawakened with a slight degree of difficult respiration, so as to induce\r\nthem to rise hastily up in bed; and have hence suspected, that this was a\r\ntendency to a kind of asthma, owing to a deficient absorption of blood in\r\nthe extremities of the pulmonary or bronchial veins; and have concluded\r\nfrom thence, that there was generally a deficiency of venous absorption;\r\nand that this was the occasion of their frequent abortion. Which is further\r\ncountenanced, where a great sanguinary discharge precedes or follows the\r\nexclusion of the fetus.\r\n\r\nM. M. Opium, bark, chalybeates in small quantity. Change to a warmer\r\nclimate. I have directed with success in four cases half a grain of opium\r\ntwice a day for a fortnight, and then a whole grain twice a day during the\r\nwhole gestation. One of these patients took besides twenty grains of\r\nPeruvian bark for several weeks. By these means being exactly and regularly\r\npersisted in, a new habit became established, and the usual miscarriages\r\nwere prevented.\r\n\r\nMiscarriages more frequently happen from eruptive fevers, and from\r\nrheumatic ones, than from other inflammatory diseases. I saw a most violent\r\npleurisy and hepatitis cured by repeated venesection about a week or ten\r\ndays before parturition; yet another lady whom I attended, miscarried at\r\nthe end of the chicken pox, with which her children were at the same time\r\naffected. Miscarriages towards the termination of the small pox are very\r\nfrequent, yet there have been a few instances of children, who have been\r\nborn with the eruption on them. The blood in the small pox will not\r\ninoculate that disease, if taken before the commencement of the secondary\r\nfever; as shewn in Sect. XXXIII. 2. 10. because the contagious matter is\r\nnot yet formed, but after it has been oxygenated through the cuticle in the\r\npustules, it becomes contagious; and if it be then absorbed, as in the\r\nsecondary fever, the blood of the mother may become contagious, and infect\r\nthe child. The same mode of reasoning is applicable to the chicken pox. See\r\nClass IV. 3. 1. 7.\r\n\r\n15. _Scorbutus._ Sea-scurvy is caused by salt diet, the perpetual stimulus\r\nof which debilitates the venous and absorbent systems. Hence the blood is\r\nimperfectly taken up by the veins from the capillaries, whence brown and\r\nblack spots appear upon the skin without fever. The limbs become livid and\r\nedematous, and lastly ulcers are produced from deficient absorption. See\r\nSect. XXXIII. 3. 2. and Class II. 1. 4. 13. For an account of the scurvy of\r\nthe lungs, see Sect. XXVII. 2.\r\n\r\nM. M. Fresh animal and vegetable food. Infusion of malt. New beer. Sugar.\r\nWine. Steel. Bark. Sorbentia. Opium?\r\n\r\n16. _Vibices._ Extravasations of blood become black from their being\r\nsecluded from the air. The extravasation of blood in bruises, or in some\r\nfevers, or after death in some patients, especially in the parts which were\r\nexposed to pressure, is owing to the fine terminations of the veins having\r\nbeen mechanically compressed so as to prevent their absorbing the blood\r\nfrom the capillaries, or to their inactivity from disease. The blood when\r\nextravasated undergoes a chemical change before it is sufficiently fluid to\r\nbe taken up by the lymphatic absorbents, and in that process changes its\r\ncolour to green and then yellow.\r\n\r\n17. _Petechiæ._ Purple spots. These attend fevers with great venous\r\ninirritability, and are probably formed by the inability of a single\r\ntermination of a vein, whence the corresponding capillary becomes ruptured,\r\nand effuses the blood into the cellular membrane round the inert\r\ntermination of the vein. This is generally esteemed a sign of the putrid\r\nstate of the blood, or that state contrary to the inflammatory one. As it\r\nattends some inflammatory diseases which are attended with great\r\ninirritability, as in the confluent small pox. But it also attends the\r\nscurvy, where no fever exists, and it therefore simply announces the\r\ninactivity of the terminations of some veins; and is thence indeed a bad\r\nsymptom in fevers, as a mark of approaching inactivity of the whole\r\nsanguiferous system, or death. The blue colour of some children's arms or\r\nfaces in very cold weather is owing in like manner to the torpor of the\r\nabsorbent terminations of the veins, whence the blood is accumulated in\r\nthem, and sometimes bursts them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nORDO II.\r\n\r\n_Decreased Irritation._\r\n\r\nGENUS II.\r\n\r\n_Decreased Action of the Secerning System._\r\n\r\nThese are always attended with decrease of partial, or of general heat; for\r\nas the heat of animal bodies is the consequence of their various\r\nsecretions, and is perpetually passing away into the ambient air, or other\r\nbodies in contact with them; when these secretions become diminished, or\r\ncease, the heat of the part or of the whole is soon diminished, or ceases\r\nalong with them.\r\n\r\nSPECIES.\r\n\r\n1. _Frigus febrile._ Febrile coldness. There is reason to believe, that the\r\nbeginning of many fever-fits originates in the quiescence of some part of\r\nthe absorbent system, especially where they have been owing to external\r\ncold; but that, where the coldness of the body is not owing to a diminution\r\nof external heat, it arises from the inaction of some part of the secerning\r\nsystem. Hence some parts of the body are hot whilst other parts are cold;\r\nwhich I suppose gave occasion to error in Martyn's Experiments; where he\r\nsays, that the body is as hot in the cold paroxysms of fevers as at other\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nAfter the sensorial power has been much diminished by great preceding\r\nactivity of the system, as by long continued external heat, or violent\r\nexercise, a sudden exposure to much cold produces a torpor both greater in\r\ndegree and over a greater portion of the system, by subtracting their\r\naccustomed stimulus from parts already much deprived of their irritability.\r\nDr. Franklin in a letter to M. Duberge, the French translator of his works,\r\nmentions an instance of four young men, who bathed in a cold spring after a\r\nday's harvest work; of whom two died on the spot, a third on the next\r\nmorning, and the other survived with difficulty. Hence it would appear,\r\nthat those, who have to travel in intensely cold weather, will sooner\r\nperish, who have previously heated themselves much with drams, than those\r\nwho have only the stimulus of natural food; of which I have heard one well\r\nattested instance. See Article VII. 2. 3. Class III. 2. 1. 17.\r\n\r\n_Frigus chronicum._ Permanent coldness. Coldness of the extremities,\r\nwithout fever, with dry pale skin, is a symptom of general debility, owing\r\nto the decreased action of the arterial system, and of the capillary\r\nvessels; whence the perspirable matter is secreted in less quantity, and in\r\nconsequence the skin is less warm. This coldness is observable at the\r\nextremities of the limbs, ears, and nose, more than in any other parts: as\r\na larger surface is here exposed to the contact of the air, or clothes, and\r\nthence the heat is more hastily carried away.\r\n\r\nThe pain, which accompanies the coldness of the skin, is owing to the\r\ndeficient exertion of the subcutaneous vessels, and probably to the\r\naccumulation of sensorial power in the extremities of their nerves. See\r\nSect. XII. 5. 3. XIV. 6. XXXII. 3. and Class I. 2. 4. 1.\r\n\r\nM. M. A blister. Incitantia, nutrientia, sorbentia. Exercise. Clothes.\r\nFire. Joy. Anger.\r\n\r\n2. _Pallor fugitivus._ The fugitive paleness, which accompanies the\r\ncoldness of the extremities, is owing to a less quantity of blood passing\r\nthrough the capillaries of the skin in a given time; where the absorbent\r\npower of the veins is at the same time much diminished, a part of the blood\r\nlingers at their junction with the capillary arteries, and a bluish tinge\r\nis mixed with the paleness; as is seen in the loose skin under the\r\neye-lids, and is always a mark of temporary debility. See Class II. 1. 4.\r\n4. Where the paleness of the skin is owing to the deficiency of red\r\nglobules in the blood, it is joined with a yellowish tinge; which is the\r\ncolour of the serum, with which the blood then abounds, as in chlorosis,\r\nand in torpor or paralysis of the liver, and is often mistaken for a\r\nsuperabundance of bile.\r\n\r\nA permanent paleness of the skin is owing to the coalescence of the minute\r\narteries, as in old age. See Class I. 2. 2. 9. There is another source of\r\npaleness from the increased absorption of the terminations of the veins, as\r\nwhen vinegar is applied to the lips. See Sect. XXVII. 1. and another from\r\nthe retrograde motions of the capillaries and fine extremities of the\r\narteries. See Class II. 3. 1. 1.\r\n\r\nM. M. A blister, nutrientia, incitantia, exercise, oxygene gas.\r\n\r\n3. _Pus parcius._ Diminished pus. Dryness of ulcers. In the cold fits of\r\nfever all the secretions are diminished, whether natural or artificial, as\r\ntheir quantity depends on the actions of the glands or capillaries, which\r\nthen share in the universal inaction of the system. Hence the dryness of\r\nissues and blisters in great debility, and before the approach of death, is\r\nowing to deficient secretion, and not to increased absorption.\r\n\r\nM. M. Opium, wine in very small quantities, Peruvian bark.\r\n\r\n4. _Mucus parcior._ Diminished mucus. Dryness of the mouth and nostrils.\r\nThis also occurs in the cold fits of intermittents. In these cases I have\r\nalso found the tongue cold to the touch of the finger, and the breath to\r\nthe back of one's hand, when opposed to it, which are very inauspicious\r\nsymptoms, and generally fatal. In fevers with inirritability it is\r\ngenerally esteemed a good symptom, when the nostrils and tongue become\r\nmoist after having been previously dry; as it shews an increased action of\r\nthe mucous glands of those membranes, which were before torpid. And the\r\ncontrary to this is the facies Hippocratica, or countenance so well\r\ndescribed by Hippocrates, which is pale, cold, and shrunk; all which are\r\nowing to the inactivity of the secerning vessels, the paleness from there\r\nbeing less red blood passing through the capillaries, the coldness of the\r\nskin from there being less secretion of perspirable matter, and the shrunk\r\nappearance from there being less mucus secreted into the cells of the\r\ncellular membrane. See Class IV. 2. 4. 11.\r\n\r\nM. M. Blisters. Incitantia.\r\n\r\n5. _Urina parcior pallida._ Paucity of pale urine, as in the cold fits of\r\nintermittents; it appears in some nervous fevers throughout the whole\r\ndisease, and seems to proceed from a palsy of the kidnies; which probably\r\nwas the cause of the fever, as the fever sometimes ceases, when that\r\nsymptom is removed: hence the straw-coloured urine in this fever is so far\r\nsalutary, as it shews the unimpaired action of the kidnies.\r\n\r\nM. M. Balsams, essential oil, asparagus, rhubarb, a blister. Cantharides\r\ninternally.\r\n\r\n6. _Torpor hepaticus._ Paucity of bile from a partial inaction of the\r\nliver; hence the bombycinous colour of the skin, grey stools, urine not\r\nyellow, indigestion, debility, followed by tympany, dropsy, and death.\r\n\r\nThis paralysis or inirritability of the liver often destroys those who have\r\nbeen long habituated to much fermented liquor, and have suddenly omitted\r\nthe use of it. It also destroys plumbers, and house-painters, and in them\r\nseems a substitute for the colica saturnina. See Sect. XXX.\r\n\r\nM. M. Aloe and calomel, then the bark, and chalybeates. Mercurial ointment\r\nrubbed on the region of the liver. Rhubarb, three or four grains, with\r\nopium half a grain to a grain twice a day. Equitation, warm bath for half\r\nan hour everyday.\r\n\r\n7. _Torpor Pancreatis._ Torpor of the pancreas. I saw what I conjectured to\r\nbe a tumour of the pancreas with indigestion, and which terminated in the\r\ndeath of the patient. He had been for many years a great consumer of\r\ntobacco, insomuch that he chewed that noxious drug all the morning, and\r\nsmoaked it all the afternoon. As the secretion from the pancreas resembles\r\nsaliva in its general appearance, and probably in its office of assisting\r\ndigestion, by preventing the fermentation of the aliment; as would appear\r\nby the experiments of Pringle and Macbride; there is reason to suspect,\r\nthat a sympathy may exist between the salivary and pancreatic glands; and\r\nthat the perpetual stimulus of the former by tobacco might in process of\r\ntime injure the latter. See Tobacco, Article III. 2. 2.\r\n\r\n8. _Torpor renis._ Inirritability or paralysis of the kidnies is probably\r\nfrequently mistaken for gravel in them. Several, who have lived rather\r\nintemperately in respect to fermented or spirituous liquors, become\r\nsuddenly seized about the age of sixty, or later, with a total stoppage of\r\nurine; though they have previously had no symptoms of gravel. In these\r\ncases there is no water in the bladder; as is known by the introduction of\r\nthe catheter, of which those made of elastic gum are said to be preferable\r\nto metallic ones; or it may generally be known by the shape of the abdomen,\r\neither by the eye or hand. Bougies and catheters of elastic gum are sold at\r\nN^o 37, Red Lion-street, Holborn, London.\r\n\r\nM. M. Electric shocks, warm bath. Emetics. See calculus renis, Class I. 1.\r\n3. 9. When no gravel has been previously observed, and the patient has been\r\na wine-drinker rather than an ale-drinker, the case is generally owing to\r\ninirritability of the tubuli uriniferi, and is frequently fatal. See Class\r\nI. 2. 4. 20.\r\n\r\n9. _Punctæ mucosæ vultûs._ Mucous spots on the face. These are owing to the\r\ninactivity of the excretory ducts of the mucous glands; the thinner part of\r\nthis secretion exhales, and the remainder becomes inspissated, and lodges\r\nin the duct; the extremity of which becomes black by exposure to the air.\r\n\r\nM. M. They may be pressed out by the finger-nails. Warm water. Ether\r\nfrequently applied. Blister on the part?\r\n\r\n10. _Maculæ cutis fulvæ._ Morphew or freckles. Tawny blotches on the skin\r\nof the face and arms of elderly people, and frequently on their legs after\r\nslight erysipelas. The freckles on the face of younger people, who have red\r\nhair, seem to be a similar production, and seem all to be caused by the\r\ncoalescence of the minute arteries or capillaries of the part. In a scar\r\nafter a wound the integument is only opake; but in these blotches, which\r\nare called morphew and freckles, the small vessels seem to have become\r\ninactive with some of the serum of the blood stagnating in them, from\r\nwhence their colour. See Class III. 1. 2. 12.\r\n\r\nM. M. Warm bathing. A blister on the part?\r\n\r\n11. _Canities._ Grey hair. In the injection of the vessels of animals for\r\nthe purposes of anatomical preparations, the colour of the injected fluid\r\nwill not pass into many very minute vessels; which nevertheless uncoloured\r\nwater, or spirits, or quicksilver will permeate. The same occurs in the\r\nfiltration of some coloured fluids through paper, or very fine sand, where\r\nthe colouring matter is not perfectly dissolved, but only diffused through\r\nthe liquid. This has led some to imagine, that the cause of the whiteness\r\nof the hair in elderly people may arise from the diminution, or greater\r\ntenuity, of the glandular vessels, which secrete the mucus, which hardens\r\ninto hair; and that the same difference of the tenuity of the secerning\r\nvessels may possibly make the difference of colour of the silk from\r\ndifferent silk-worms, which is of all shades from yellow to white.\r\n\r\nBut as the secreted fluids are not the consequence of mechanical\r\nfiltration, but of animal selection; we must look out for another cause,\r\nwhich must be found in the decreasing activity of the glands, as we advance\r\nin life; and which affects many of our other secretions as well as that of\r\nthe mucus, which forms the hair. Hence grey hairs are produced on the faces\r\nof horses by whatever injures the glands at their roots, as by corrosive\r\nblisters; and frequently on the human subject by external injuries on the\r\nhead; and sometimes by fevers. And as the grey colour of hair consists in\r\nits want of transparency, like water converted into snow; there is reason\r\nto suppose, that a defect of secreted moisture simply may be the cause of\r\nthis kind of opacity, as explained in Cataracta, Class I. 2. 2. 13.\r\n\r\nM. M. Whatever prevents the inirritability and insensibility of the system,\r\nthat is, whatever prevents the approach of old age, will so far counteract\r\nthe production of grey hairs, which is a symptom of it. For this purpose in\r\npeople, who are not corpulent, and perhaps in those who are so, the warm\r\nbath twice or thrice a week is particularly serviceable. See Sect. XXXIX.\r\n5. 1. on the colours of animals, and Class I. 1. 2. 15.\r\n\r\n12. _Callus._ The callous skin on the hands and feet of laborious people is\r\nowing to the extreme vessels coalescing from the perpetual pressure they\r\nare exposed to.\r\n\r\nAs we advance in life, the finer arteries lose their power of action, and\r\ntheir sides grow together; hence the paleness of the skins of elderly\r\npeople, and the loss of that bloom, which is owing to the numerous fine\r\narteries, and the transparency of the skin, that encloses them.\r\n\r\nM. M. Warm bath. Paring the thick skin with a knife. Smoothing it with a\r\npumice stone. Cover the part with oiled silk to prevent the evaporation of\r\nthe perspirable matter, and thus to keep it moist.\r\n\r\n13. _Cataracta_ is an opacity of the crystalline lens of the eye. It is a\r\ndisease of light-coloured eyes, as the gutta serena is of dark ones. On\r\ncutting off with scissars the cornea of a calf's eye, and holding it in the\r\npalm of one's hand, so as to gain a proper light, the artery, which\r\nsupplies nutriment to the crystalline humour, is easily and beautifully\r\nseen; as it rises from the centre of the optic nerve through the vitreous\r\nhumour to the crystalline. It is this point, where the artery enters the\r\neye through the cineritious part of the optic nerve, (which is in part near\r\nthe middle of the nerve,) which is without sensibility to light; as is\r\nshewn by fixing three papers, each of them about half an inch in diameter,\r\nagainst a wall about a foot distant from each other, about the height of\r\nthe eye; and then looking at the middle one, with one eye, and retreating\r\ntill you lose sight of one of the external papers. Now as the animal grows\r\nolder, the artery becomes less visible, and perhaps carries only a\r\ntransparent fluid, and at length in some subjects I suppose ceases to be\r\npervious; then it follows, that the crystalline lens, losing some fluid,\r\nand gaining none, becomes dry, and in consequence opake; for the same\r\nreason, that wet or oiled paper is more transparent than when it is dry, as\r\nexplained in Class I. 1. 4. 1. The want of moisture in the cornea of old\r\npeople, when the exhalation becomes greater than the supply, is the cause\r\nof its want of transparency; and which like the crystalline gains rather a\r\nmilky opacity. The same analogy may be used to explain the whiteness of the\r\nhair of old people, which loses its pellucidity along with its moisture.\r\nSee Class I. 2. 2. 11.\r\n\r\nM. M. Small electric shocks through the eye. A quarter of a grain of\r\ncorrosive sublimate of mercury dissolved in brandy, or taken in a pill,\r\ntwice a day for six weeks. Couching by depression, or by extraction. The\r\nformer of these operations is much to be preferred to the latter, though\r\nthe latter is at this time so fashionable, that a surgeon is almost\r\ncompelled to use it, lest he should not be thought an expert operator. For\r\ndepressing the cataract is attended with no pain, no danger, no\r\nconfinement, and may be as readily repeated, if the crystalline should rise\r\nagain to the centre of the eye. The extraction of the cataract is attended\r\nwith considerable pain, with long confinement, generally with fever, always\r\nwith inflammation, and frequently with irreparable injury to the iris, and\r\nconsequent danger to the whole eye. Yet has this operation of extraction\r\nbeen trumpeted into universal fashion for no other reason but because it is\r\ndifficult to perform, and therefore keeps the business in the hands of a\r\nfew empyrics, who receive larger rewards, regardless of the hazard, which\r\nis encountered by the flattered patient.\r\n\r\nA friend of mine returned yesterday from London after an absence of many\r\nweeks; he had a cataract in a proper state for the operation, and in spite\r\nof my earnest exhortation to the contrary, was prevailed upon to have it\r\nextracted rather than depressed. He was confined to his bed three weeks\r\nafter the operation, and is now returned with the iris adhering on one side\r\nso as to make an oblong aperture; and which is nearly, if not totally,\r\nwithout contraction, and thus greatly impedes the little vision, which he\r\npossesses. Whereas I saw some patients couched by depression many years ago\r\nby a then celebrated empyric, Chevalier Taylor, who were not confined above\r\na day or two, that the eye might gradually be accustomed to light, and who\r\nsaw as well as by extraction, perhaps better, without either pain, or\r\ninflammation, or any hazard of losing the eye.\r\n\r\nAs the inflammation of the iris is probably owing to forcing the\r\ncrystalline through the aperture of it in the operation of extracting it,\r\ncould it not be done more safely by making the opening behind the iris and\r\nciliary process into the vitreous humour? but the operation would still be\r\nmore painful, more dangerous, and not more useful than that by depressing\r\nit.\r\n\r\n14. _Innutritio ossium._ Innutrition of the bones. Not only the blood\r\neffused in vibices and petechiæ, or from bruises, as well as the blood and\r\nnew vessels in inflamed parts, are reabsorbed by the increased action of\r\nthe lymphatics; but the harder materials, which constitute the fangs of the\r\nfirst set of teeth, and the ends of exfoliating bones, and sometimes the\r\nmatter of chalk-stones in the gout, the coagulable lymph, which is\r\ndeposited on the lungs, or on the muscles after inflammation of those\r\nparts, and which frequently produces difficulty of breathing, and the pains\r\nof chronic rheumatism, and lastly the earthy part of the living bones are\r\ndissolved and absorbed by the increased actions of this system of vessels.\r\nSee Sect. XXXIII. 3. 1.\r\n\r\nThe earthy part of bones in this disease of the innutrition of them seems\r\nto suffer a solution, and reabsorption; while the secerning vessels do not\r\nsupply a sufficient quantity of calcareous earth and phosphoric acid, which\r\nconstitute the substance of bones. As calcareous earth abounds every where,\r\nis the want of phosphoric acid the remote cause? One cause of this malady\r\nis given in the Philosophic Transactions, where the patient had been\r\naccustomed to drink large quantities of vinegar. Two cases are described by\r\nMr. Gouch. In one case, which I saw, a considerable quantity of calcareous\r\nearth, and afterwards of bone-ashes, and of decoction of madder, and also\r\nof sublimate of mercury, were given without effect. All the bones became\r\nsoft, many of them broke, and the patient seemed to die from the want of\r\nbeing able to distend her chest owing to the softness of the ribs.\r\n\r\nM. M. Salt of urine, called sal microcosmicum, phosphorated soda. Calcined\r\nhartshorn. Bone-ashes. Hard or petrifying water, as that of Matlock, or\r\nsuch as is found in all limestone or marly countries. The calcareous earth\r\nin these waters might possibly be carried to the bones, as madder is known\r\nto colour them. Warm bath. Volatile or fixed alcali as a lotion on the\r\nspine, or essential oils.\r\n\r\nThe innutrition of the bones is often first to be perceived by the\r\ndifficulty of breathing and palpitation of the heart on walking a little\r\nfaster than usual, which I suppose is owing to the softness of the ends of\r\nthe ribs adjoining to the sternum; on which account they do not perfectly\r\ndistend the chest, when they are raised by the pectoral and intercostal\r\nmuscles with greater force than usual. After this the spine becomes curved\r\nboth by the softness of its vertebræ, and for the purpose of making room\r\nfor the disturbed heart. See Species 16 of this genus.\r\n\r\nAs these patients are pale and weak, there would seem to be a deficiency of\r\noxygene in their blood, and in consequence a deficiency of phosphoric acid;\r\nwhich is probably produced by oxygene in the act of respiration.\r\n\r\nMr. Bonhome in the Chemical Annals, August, 1793, supposes the rickets to\r\narise from the prevalence of vegetable or acetous acid, which is known to\r\nsoften bones out of the body. Mr. Dettaen seems to have espoused a similar\r\nopinion, and both of them in consequence give alcalies and testacea. If\r\nthis theory was just, the soft bones of such patients should shew evident\r\nmarks of such acidity after death; which I believe has not been observed.\r\nNor is it analogous to other animal facts, that nutritious fluids secreted\r\nby the finest vessels of the body should be so little animalized, as to\r\nretain acetous or vegetable acidity.\r\n\r\nThe success attending the following case in so short a time as a fortnight\r\nI ascribed principally to the use of the warm bath; in which the patient\r\ncontinued for full half an hour every night, in the degree of heat, which\r\nwas most grateful to her sensation, which might be I suppose about 94. Miss\r\n----, about ten years of age, and very tall and thin, has laboured under\r\npalpitation of her heart, and difficult breathing on the least exercise,\r\nwith occasional violent dry cough, for a year or more, with dry lips,\r\nlittle appetite either for food or drink, and dry skin, with cold\r\nextremities. She has at times been occasionally worse, and been relieved in\r\nsome degree by the bark. She began to bend forwards, and to lift up her\r\nshoulders. The former seemed owing to a beginning curvature of the spine,\r\nthe latter was probably caused to facilitate her difficult respiration.\r\n\r\nM. M. She used the warm bath, as above related; which by its warmth might\r\nincrease the irritability of the smallest series of vessels, and by\r\nsupplying more moisture to the blood might probably tend to carry further\r\nthe materials, which form calcareous or bony particles, or to convey them\r\nin more dilute solution. She took twice a day twenty grains of extract of\r\nbark, twenty grains of soda phosphorata, and ten grams of chalk, and ten of\r\ncalcined hartshorn mixed into a powder with ten drops of laudanum; with\r\nflesh food both to dinner and supper; and port wine and water instead of\r\nthe small beer, she had been accustomed to; she lay on a sofa frequently in\r\na day, and occasionally used a neck-swing.\r\n\r\n15. _Rachitis._ Rickets. The head is large, protuberant chiefly on the\r\nforepart. The smaller joints are swelled; the ribs depressed; the belly\r\ntumid, with other parts emaciated. This disease from the innutrition or\r\nsoftness of the bones arose about two centuries ago; seems to have been\r\nhalf a century in an increasing or spreading state; continued about half a\r\ncentury at its height, or greatest diffusion; and is now nearly vanished:\r\nwhich gives reason to hope, that the small-pox, measles, and venereal\r\ndisease, which are all of modern production, and have already become\r\nmilder, may in process of time vanish from the earth, and perhaps be\r\nsucceeded by new ones! See the preceding species.\r\n\r\n16. _Spinæ distortio._ Distortion of the spine is another disease\r\noriginating from the innutrition or softness of the bones. I once saw a\r\nchild about six years old with palpitation of heart, and quickness of\r\nrespiration, which began to have a curvature of the spine; I then doubted,\r\nwhether the palpitation and quick respiration were the cause or consequence\r\nof the curvature of the spine; suspecting either that nature had bent the\r\nspine outwards to give room to the enlarged heart; or that the malformation\r\nof the chest had compressed and impeded the movements of the heart. But a\r\nfew weeks ago on attending a young lady about ten years old, whose spine\r\nhad lately began to be distorted, with very great difficulty and quickness\r\nof respiration, and alarming palpitation of the heart, I convinced myself,\r\nthat the palpitation and difficult respiration were the effect of the\r\nchange of the cavity of the chest from the distortion of the spine; and\r\nthat the whole was therefore a disease of the innutrition or softness of\r\nthe bones.\r\n\r\nFor on directing her to lie down much in the day, and to take the bark, the\r\ndistortion became less, and the palpitation and quick respiration became\r\nless at the same time. After this observation a neck-swing was directed,\r\nand she took the bark, madder, and bone-ashes; and she continues to amend\r\nboth in her shape and health.\r\n\r\nDelicate young ladies are very liable to become awry at many boarding\r\nschools. This is occasioned principally by their being obliged too long to\r\npreserve an erect attitude, by sitting on forms many hours together. To\r\nprevent this the school-seats should have either backs, on which they may\r\noccasionally rest themselves; or desks before them, on which they may\r\noccasionally lean. This is a thing of greater consequence than may appear\r\nto those, who have not attended to it.\r\n\r\nWhen the least tendency to become awry is observed, they should be advised\r\nto lie down on a bed or sofa for an hour in the middle of the day for many\r\nmonths; which generally prevents the increase of this deformity by taking\r\noff for a time the pressure on the spine of the back, and it at the same\r\ntime tends to make them grow taller. Young persons, when nicely measured,\r\nare found to be half an inch higher in a morning than at night; as is well\r\nknown to those, who inlist very young men for soldiers. This is owing to\r\nthe cartilages between the bones of the back becoming compressed by the\r\nweight of the head and shoulders on them during the day. It is the same\r\npressure which produces curvatures and distortions of the spine in growing\r\nchildren, where the bones are softer than usual; and which may thus be\r\nrelieved by an horizontal posture for an hour in the middle of the day, or\r\nby being frequently allowed to lean on a chair, or to play on the ground on\r\na carpet.\r\n\r\nYoung ladies should also be directed, where two sleep in a bed, to change\r\nevery night, or every week, their sides of the bed; which will prevent\r\ntheir tendency to sleep always on the same side; which is not only liable\r\nto produce crookedness, but also to occasion diseases by the internal parts\r\nbeing so long kept in uniform contact as to grow together. For the same\r\nreason they should not be allowed to sit always on the same side of the\r\nfire or window, because they will then be inclined too frequently to bend\r\nthemselves to one side.\r\n\r\nAnother great cause of injury to the shape of young ladies is from the\r\npressure of stays, or other tight bandages, which at the same time cause\r\nother diseases by changing the form or situation of the internal parts. If\r\na hard part of the stays, even a knot of the thread, with which they are\r\nsewed together, is pressed hard upon one side more than the other, the\r\nchild bends from the side most painful, and thus occasions a curvature of\r\nthe spine. To counteract this effect such stays, as have fewest hard parts,\r\nand especially such as can be daily or weekly turned, are preferable to\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhere frequent lying down on a sofa in the day-time, and swinging\r\nfrequently for a short time by the hands or head, with loose dress, do not\r\nrelieve a beginning distortion of the back; recourse may be had to a chair\r\nwith stuffed moveable arms for the purpose of suspending the weight of the\r\nbody by cushions under the arm-pits, like resting on crutches, or like the\r\nleading strings of infants. From the top of the back of the same chair a\r\ncurved steel bar may also project to suspend the body occasionally, or in\r\npart by the head, like the swing above mentioned. The use of this chair is\r\nmore efficacious in straightening the spine, than simply lying down\r\nhorizontally; as it not only takes off the pressure of the head and\r\nshoulders from the spine, but at the same time the inferior parts of the\r\nbody contribute to draw the spine straight by their weight; or lastly,\r\nrecourse may be had to a spinal machine first described in the Memoires of\r\nthe academy of surgery in Paris, Vol. III. p. 600, by M. Le Vacher, and\r\nsince made by Mr. Jones, at N^o 6, North-street, Tottenham-court Road,\r\nLondon, which suspends the head, and places the weight of it on the hips.\r\nThis machine is capable of improvement by joints in the bar at the back of\r\nit, to permit the body to bend forwards without diminishing the extension\r\nof the spine.\r\n\r\nThe objections of this machine of M. Vacher, which is made by Mr. Jones,\r\nare first, that it is worn in the day-time, and has a very unsightly\r\nappearance. Mr. Jones has endeavoured to remedy this, by taking away the\r\ncurved bar over the head, and substituting in its place a forked bar,\r\nrising up behind each ear, with webs fastened to it, which pass under the\r\nchin and occiput. But this is not an improvement, but a deterioration of M.\r\nVacher's machine, as it prevents the head from turning with facility to\r\neither side. Another objection is, that its being worn, when the muscles of\r\nthe back are in action, it is rather calculated to prevent the curvature of\r\nthe spine from becoming greater, than to extend the spine, and diminish its\r\ncurvature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFor this latter purpose I have made a steel bow, as described in the\r\nannexed plate, which receives the head longitudinally from the forehead to\r\nthe occiput; having a fork furnished with a web to sustain the chin, and\r\nanother to sustain the occiput. The summit of the bow is fixed by a swivel\r\nto the board going behind the head of the bed above the pillow. The bed is\r\nto be inclined from the head to the feet about twelve or sixteen inches.\r\nHence the patient would be constantly sliding down during sleep, unless\r\nsupported by this bow, with webbed forks, covered also with fur, placed\r\nbeneath the chin, and beneath the occiput. There are also proper webs lined\r\nwith fur for the hands to take hold off occasionally, and also to go under\r\nthe arms. By these means I should hope great advantage from gradually\r\nextending the spine during the inactivity of the muscles of the back; and\r\nthat it may be done without disturbing the sleep of the patient, and if\r\nthis should happen, the bow is made to open by a joint at the summit of it,\r\nso as to be instantly disengaged from the neck by the hand of the wearer.\r\nThis bow I have not yet had opportunity to make use of, but it may be had\r\nfrom Mr. Harrison, whitesmith, Bridge-gate, Derby.\r\n\r\nIt will be from hence easily perceived, that all other methods of confining\r\nor directing the growth of young people should be used with great skill;\r\nsuch as back-boards, or bandages, or stocks for the feet; and that their\r\napplication should not be continued too long at a time, lest worse\r\nconsequences should ensue, than the deformity they were designed to remove.\r\nTo this may be added, that the stiff erect attitude taught by some modern\r\ndancing masters does not contribute to the grace of person, but rather\r\nmilitates against it; as is well seen in one of the prints in Hogarth's\r\nAnalysis of Beauty; and is exemplifyed by the easy grace of some of the\r\nancient statues, as of the Venus de Medici, and the Antinous, and in the\r\nworks of some modern artists, as in a beautiful print of Hebe feeding an\r\nEagle, painted by Hamilton, and engraved by Eginton, and many of the\r\nfigures of Angelica Kauffman.\r\n\r\nWhere the bone of one of the vertebræ of the back has been swelled on both\r\nsides of it, so as to become protuberant, issues near the swelled part have\r\nbeen found of great service, as mentioned in Species 18 of this genus. This\r\nhas induced me to propose in curvatures of the spine, to put an issue on\r\nthe outside of the curve, where it could be certainly ascertained, as the\r\nbones on the convex side of the curve must be enlarged; in one case I\r\nthought this of service, and recommend the further trial of it.\r\n\r\nIn the tendency to curvature of the spine, whatever strengthens the general\r\nconstitution is of service; as the use of the cold bath in the summer\r\nmonths. This however requires some restriction both in respect to the\r\ndegree of coldness of the bath, the time of continuing in it, and the\r\nseason of the year. Common springs, which are of forty-eight degrees of\r\nheat, are too cold for tender constitutions, whether of children or adults,\r\nand frequently do them great and irreparable injury. The coldness of river\r\nwater in the summer months, which is about sixty-eight degrees, or that of\r\nMatlock, which is about sixty-eight, or of Buxton, which is eighty-two, are\r\nmuch to be preferred. The time of continuing in the bath should be but a\r\nminute or two, or not so long as to occasion a trembling of the limbs from\r\ncold. In respect to the season of the year, delicate children should\r\ncertainly only bathe in the summer months; as the going frequently into the\r\ncold air in winter will answer all the purposes of the cold bath.\r\n\r\n17. _Claudicatio coxaria._ Lameness of the hip. A nodding of the thigh-bone\r\nis said to be produced in feeble children by the softness of the neck or\r\nupper part of that bone beneath the cartilage; which is naturally bent, and\r\nin this disease bends more downwards, or nods, by the pressure of the body;\r\nand thus renders one leg apparently shorter than the other. In other cases\r\nthe end of the bone is protruded out of its socket, by inflammation or\r\nenlargement of the cartilages or ligaments of the joint, so that it rests\r\non some part of the edge of the acetabulum, which in time becomes filled\r\nup. When the legs are straight, as in standing erect, there is no\r\nverticillary motion in the knee-joint; all the motion then in turning out\r\nthe toes further than nature designed, must be obtained by straining in\r\nsome degree this head of the thigh-bone, or the acetabulum, or cavity, in\r\nwhich it moves. This has induced me to believe, that this misfortune of the\r\nnodding of the head by the bone, or partial dislocation of it, by which one\r\nleg becomes shorter than the other, is sometimes occasioned by making very\r\nyoung children stand in what are called stocks; that is with their heels\r\ntogether, and their toes quite out. Whence the socket of the thigh-bone\r\nbecomes inflamed and painful, or the neck of the bone is bent downward and\r\noutwards.\r\n\r\nIn this case there is no expectation of recovering the straightness of the\r\nend of the bone; but these patients are liable to another misfortune, that\r\nis, to acquire afterwards a distortion of the spine; for as one leg is\r\nshorter than the other, they sink on that side, and in consequence bend the\r\nupper part of their bodies, as their shoulders, the contrary way, to\r\nbalance themselves; and then again the neck is bent back again towards the\r\nlame side, to preserve the head perpendicular; and thus the figure becomes\r\nquite distorted like the letter S, owing originally to the deficiency of\r\nthe length of one limb. The only way to prevent this curvature of the spine\r\nis for the child to wear a high-heeled shoe or patten on the lame foot, so\r\nas to support that side on the same level with the other, and thus to\r\nprevent a greater deformity.\r\n\r\nI have this day seen a young lady about twelve, who does not limp or waddle\r\nin walking; but nevertheless, when she stands or sits, she sinks down\r\ntowards her right side, and turns out that toe more than the other. Hence,\r\nboth as she sits and stands, she bends her body to the right; whence her\r\nhead would hang a little over her right shoulder; but to replace this\r\nperpendicularly, she lifts up her left shoulder and contracts the muscles\r\non that side of the neck; which are therefore become thicker and stronger\r\nby their continued action; but there is not yet any very perceptible\r\ndistortion of the spine.\r\n\r\nAs her right toe is turned outward rather more than natural, this shews the\r\ndisease to be in the hip-joint; because, when the limb is stretched out,\r\nthe toe cannot turn horizontally in the least without moving the end of the\r\nthigh-bone; although when the knee is bent, the toe can be turned through\r\none third or half of a circle by the rotation of the tibia and fibula of\r\nthe leg round each other. Hence if children are set in stocks with their\r\nheels touching each other as they sit, and are then made to rise up, till\r\nthey stand erect, the socket or head of the thigh-bone becomes injured,\r\nespecially in those children, whose bones are soft; and a shortness of that\r\nlimb succeeds either by the bending of the neck of the thigh-bone, or by\r\nits getting out of the acetabulum; and a consequent rising of one shoulder,\r\nand a curvature of the spine is produced from so distant a cause.\r\n\r\nM. M. An elastic cushion made of curled hair should be placed under the\r\naffected hip, whenever she sits; or should be fitted to the part by means\r\nof drawers, so that she cannot avoid sitting on it. A neck-swing, and lying\r\ndown in the day, should be occasionally used to prevent or remove any\r\ncurvature of the spine. The rest as in Species 13 and 15 of this genus.\r\n\r\n18. _Spina protuberans._ Protuberant spine. One of the bones of the spine\r\nswells, and rises above the rest. This is not an uncommon disease, and\r\nbelongs to the innutrition of the bones, as the bone must become soft\r\nbefore it swells; which softness is owing to defect of the secretion of\r\nphosphorated calcareous earth. The swelling of the bone compresses a part\r\nof the brain, called the spinal marrow, within the cavity of the\r\nback-bones; and in consequence the lower limbs become paralytic, attended\r\nsometimes with difficulty of emptying the bladder and rectum.\r\n\r\nM. M. Issues put on each side of the prominent bone are of great effect, I\r\nsuppose, by their stimulus; which excites into action more of the sensorial\r\npowers of irritation and sensation, and thus gives greater activity to the\r\nvascular system in their vicinity. The methods recommended in distortion of\r\nthe spine are also to be attended to.\r\n\r\n19. _Spina bifida._ Divided spine, called also Hydrorachitis, as well as\r\nthe Hydrocephalus externus, are probably owing in part to a defect of\r\nossification of the spine and cranium; and that the collection of fluid\r\nbeneath them may originate from the general debility of the system; which\r\naffects both the secerning, and absorbent vessels.\r\n\r\nA curious circumstance, which is affirmed to attend the spina bifida, is,\r\nthat on compressing the tumor with the hand gently, the whole brain becomes\r\naffected, and the patient falls asleep. I suppose the same must happen on\r\ncompressing the hydrocephalus externus? See Sect. XVIII. 20.\r\n\r\n20. _Ossis palati defectus._ A defect of the bone of the palate, which\r\nfrequently accompanies a division of the upper lip, occurs before nativity;\r\nand is owing to the deficient action of the secerning system, from whence\r\nthe extremities are not completed. From a similar cause I have seen the\r\npoint of the tongue deficient, and one joint of the two least fingers, and\r\nof the two least toes, in the same infant; who was otherwise a fine girl.\r\nSee Sect. XXXIX. 4. 4.\r\n\r\nThe operation for the hare-lip is described by many surgical writers; but\r\nthere is a person in London, who makes very ingenious artificial palates;\r\nwhich prevents that defect of speech, which attends this malformation. This\r\nfactitious palate consists of a thin plate of silver of the shape and form\r\nof the roof of the mouth; from the front edge to the back edge of this\r\nsilver plate four or five holes are made in a straight line large enough\r\nfor a needle to pass through them; on the back of it is then sewed a piece\r\nof sponge; which when expanded with moisture is nearly as large as the\r\nsilver plate. This sponge is slipped through the division of the bone of\r\nthe palate, so as to lie above it, while the silver plate covers the\r\naperture beneath, and is suspended by the expanding sponge. This is removed\r\nevery night and washed, and returned into its place in the morning; on this\r\naccount it is convenient to have five or six of them, for the sake of\r\ncleanliness. I have been more particular in describing this invention, as I\r\ndo not know the name, or place of residence, of the maker.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nORDO II.\r\n\r\n_Decreased Irritation._\r\n\r\nGENUS III.\r\n\r\n_The Decreased Action of the Absorbent System._\r\n\r\nSome decrease of heat attends these diseases, though in a less degree than\r\nthose of the last genus, because the absorbent system of glands do not\r\ngenerate so much heat in their healthy state of action as the secerning\r\nsystem of glands, as explained in Class I. 1. 3.\r\n\r\nSPECIES.\r\n\r\n1. _Mucus faucium frigidus._ Cold mucus from the throat. Much mucus, of\r\nrather a saline taste, and less inspissated than usual, is evacuated from\r\nthe fauces by hawking, owing to the deficient absorption of the thinner\r\nparts of it. This becomes a habit in some elderly people, who are\r\ncontinually spitting it out of their mouths; and has probably been brought\r\non by taking snuff, or smoking tobacco; which by frequently stimulating the\r\nfauces have at length rendered the absorbent vessels less excitable by the\r\nnatural stimulus of the saline part of the secretion, which ought to be\r\nreabsorbed, as soon as secreted.\r\n\r\nM. M. A few grains of powder of bark frequently put into the mouth, and\r\ngradually diffused over the fauces. A gargle of barley water.\r\n\r\n2. _Sudor frigidus._ The cold dampness of the hands of some people is\r\ncaused by the deficient absorption of perspirable matter; the clammy or\r\nviscid feel of it is owing to the mucous part being left upon the skin. The\r\ncoldness is produced both by the decreased action of the absorbent system,\r\nand by the evaporation of a greater quantity of the perspirable matter into\r\nthe air, which ought to have been absorbed.\r\n\r\nM. M. Wash the hands in lime water, or with a small quantity of volatile\r\nalcali in water.\r\n\r\n3. _Catarrhus frigidus._ The thin discharge from the nostrils in cold\r\nweather. The absorbent vessels become torpid by the diminution of external\r\nheat, sooner than the secerning ones, which are longer kept warm by the\r\ncirculating blood, from which they select the fluid they secrete; whereas\r\nthe absorbent vessels of the nostrils drink up their fluids, namely the\r\nthin and saline part of the mucus, after it has been cooled by the\r\natmosphere. Hence the absorbents ceasing to act, and the secerning vessels\r\ncontinuing some time longer to pour out the mucus, a copious thin discharge\r\nis produced, which trickles down the nostrils in cold weather. This\r\ndischarge is so acrid as to inflame the upper lip; which is owing to the\r\nneutral salts, with which it abounds, not being reabsorbed; so the tears in\r\nthe fistula lacrymalis inflame the cheek. See Class I. 1. 2. 7.\r\n\r\n4. _Expectoratio frigida._ Cold expectoration. Where the pulmonary\r\nabsorption is deficient, an habitual cough is produced, and a frequent\r\nexpectoration of thin saline mucus; as is often seen in old enfeebled\r\npeople. Though the stimulus of the saline fluid, which attends all\r\nsecretions, is not sufficient to excite the languid absorbent vessels to\r\nimbibe it; yet this saline part, together with the increased quantity of\r\nthe whole of the secreted mucus, stimulates the branches of the bronchia,\r\nso as to induce an almost incessant cough to discharge it from the lungs. A\r\nsingle grain of opium, or any other stimulant drug, as a wine-posset with\r\nspirit of hartshorn, will cure this cold cough, and the cold catarrh of the\r\npreceding article, like a charm, by stimulating the torpid mouths of the\r\nabsorbents into action. Which has given rise to an indiscriminate and\r\nfrequently pernicious use of the warm regimen in coughs and catarrhs of the\r\nwarm or inflammatory kind, to the great injury of many.\r\n\r\nM. M. Half a grain of opium night and morning promotes the absorption of\r\nthe more fluid and saline parts, and in consequence thickens the mucus, and\r\nabates its acrimony. Warm diluent drink, wine-whey, with volatile alcali.\r\n\r\n5. _Urina uberior pallida._ On being exposed naked to cold air, or\r\nsprinkled with cold water, a quantity of pale urine is soon discharged; for\r\nthe absorbents of the bladder become torpid by their sympathy with those of\r\nthe skin; which are rendered quiescent by the diminution of external heat;\r\nbut the kidnies continue to secrete the urine, and as no part of it is\r\nabsorbed, it becomes copious and pale. This happens from a similar cause in\r\ncold fits of agues; and in less degree to many debilitated constitutions,\r\nwhose extremities are generally cold and pale. The great quantity of limpid\r\nwater in hysteric cases, and in diabætes, belongs to Class I. 3. 1. 10. I.\r\n3. 2. 6.\r\n\r\nM. M. Tincture of cantharides, opium, alum, sorbentia. Flannel shirt in\r\ncold weather. Animal food. Beer. Wine. Friction. Exercise. Fire.\r\n\r\n6. _Diarrhoea frigida._ Liquid stools are produced by exposing the body\r\nnaked to cold air, or sprinkling it with cold water, for the same reason as\r\nthe last article.\r\n\r\nBut this disease is sometimes of a dangerous nature; the intestinal\r\nabsorption being so impaired, that the aliment is said to come away\r\nundiminished in quantity, and almost unchanged by the powers of digestion,\r\nand is then called lientery.\r\n\r\nThe mucus of the rectum sometimes comes away like pellucid hartshorn jelly,\r\nand liquefies by heat like that, towards the end of inirritative fevers,\r\nwhich is owing to the thinner part of the mucus not being absorbed, and\r\nthus resembles the catarrh of some old people.\r\n\r\nM. M. Opium, campechy wood, armenian bole. Blister. Flannel shirt in cold\r\nweather. Clysters with opium. Friction on the bowels morning and night.\r\nEquitation twice a day.\r\n\r\n7. _Fluor albus frigidus._ Cold fluor albus. In weak constitutions, where\r\nthis discharge is pellucid and thin, it must proceed from want of\r\nabsorption of the mucous membrane of the vagina, or uterus, and not from an\r\nincreased secretion. This I suspect to be the most frequent kind of fluor\r\nalbus; the former one described at Class I. 1. 2. 11. attends menstruation,\r\nor is a discharge instead of it, and thus resembles the venereal orgasm of\r\nfemale quadrupeds. The discharge in this latter kind being more saline, is\r\nliable to excoriate the part, and thus produce smarting in making water; in\r\nits great degree it is difficult to cure.\r\n\r\nM. M. Increase the evacuation by stool and by perspiration, by taking\r\nrhubarb every night, about six or ten grains with one grain of opium for\r\nsome months. Flannel shirt in winter. Balsam copaiva. Gum kino, bitters,\r\nchalybeates, friction over the whole skin with flannel morning and night.\r\nPartial cold bath, by sprinkling the loins and thighs, or sponging them\r\nwith cold water. Mucilage, as isinglass boiled in milk; blanc mange,\r\nhartshorn jelly, are recommended by some. Tincture of cantharides sometimes\r\nseems of service given from ten to twenty drops or more, three or four\r\ntimes a day. A large plaster of burgundy pitch and armenian bole, so as to\r\ncover the loins and lower part of the belly, is said to have sometimes\r\nsucceeded by increasing absorption by its compression in the manner of a\r\nbandage. A solution of metallic salts, as white vitriol, sixty grains to a\r\npint; or an infusion of oak-bark may be injected into the vagina. Cold\r\nbath.\r\n\r\n8. _Gonorrhoea frigida._ Cold gleet. Where the gleet is thin and pellucid,\r\nit must arise from the want of absorption of the membranes of the urethra,\r\nrather than from an increased secretion from them. This I suppose to be a\r\nmore common disease than that mentioned at Class I. 1. 2. 10.\r\n\r\nM. M. Metallic injections, partial cold bath, internal method as in the\r\nfluor albus above described. Balsam of copaiva. Tincture of cantharides.\r\n\r\n9. _Hepatis tumor._ The liver becomes enlarged from defect of the\r\nabsorption of mucus from its cells, as in anasarca, especially in feeble\r\nchildren; at the same time less bile is secreted from the torpid\r\ncirculation in the vena portæ. And as the absorbents, which resume the\r\nthinner parts of the bile from the gall-bladder and hepatic ducts, are also\r\ntorpid or quiescent, the bile is more dilute, as well as in less quantity.\r\nFrom the obstruction of the passage of the blood through the compressed\r\nvena porta these patients have tumid bellies, and pale bloated\r\ncountenances; their paleness is probably owing to the deficiency of the\r\nquantity of red globules in the blood in consequence of the inert state of\r\nthe bile.\r\n\r\nThese symptoms in children are generally attended with worms, the dilute\r\nbile and the weak digestion not destroying them. In sleep I have seen\r\nfleuke-worms in the gall-ducts themselves among the dilute bile; which\r\ngall-ducts they eat through, and then produce ulcers, and the hectic fever,\r\ncalled the rot. See Class I. 1. 4. 10. and Article IV. 2. 6.\r\n\r\nM. M. After a calomel purge, crude iron-filings are specific in this\r\ndisease in children, and the worms are destroyed by the returning acrimony\r\nand quantity of the bile. A blister on the region of the liver. Sorbentia,\r\nas worm-seed, santonicum. Columbo. Bark.\r\n\r\n10. _Chlorosis._ When the defect of the due action of both the absorbent\r\nand secerning vessels of the liver affects women, and is attended with\r\nobstruction of the catamenia, it is called chlorosis; and is cured by the\r\nexhibition of steel, which restores by its specific stimulus the absorbent\r\npower of the liver; and the menstruation, which was obstructed in\r\nconsequence of debility, recurs.\r\n\r\nIndigestion, owing to torpor of the stomach, and a consequent too great\r\nacidity of its contents, attend this disease; whence a desire of eating\r\nchalk, or marl. Sometimes a great quantity of pale urine is discharged in a\r\nmorning, which is owing to the inaction of the absorbents, which are\r\ndistributed on the neck of the bladder, during sleep. The swelling of the\r\nankles, which frequently attends chlorosis, is another effect of deficient\r\naction of the absorbent system; and the pale countenance is occasioned by\r\nthe deficient quantity of red globules of blood, caused by the deficient\r\nquantity or acrimony of the bile, and consequent weakness of the\r\ncirculation. The pulse is so quick in some cases of chlorosis, that, when\r\nattended with an accidental cough, it may be mistaken for pulmonary\r\nconsumption. This quick pulse is owing to the debility of the heart from\r\nthe want of stimulus occasioned by the deficiency of the quantity, and\r\nacrimony of the blood.\r\n\r\nM. M. Steel. Bitters. Constant moderate exercise. Friction with flannel all\r\nover the body and limbs night and morning. Rhubarb five grains, opium half\r\na grain, every night. Flesh diet, with small beer, or wine and water. The\r\ndisease continues some months, but at length subsides by the treatment\r\nabove described. A bath of about eighty degrees, as Buxton Bath, is of\r\nservice; a colder bath may do great injury.\r\n\r\n11. _Hydrocele._ Dropsy of the vagina testis. Dropsies have been divided\r\ninto the incysted and the diffused, meaning those of the cellular membrane,\r\nthe cells of which communicate with each other like a sponge, and those of\r\nany other cavity of the body. The collections of mucous fluids in the\r\nvarious cells and cavities of the body arise from the torpor of the\r\nabsorbent vessels of those parts. It is probable, that in dropsies attended\r\nwith great thirst the cutaneous absorbents become paralytic first; and then\r\nfrom the great thirst, which is thus occasioned by the want of atmospheric\r\nmoisture, the absorption of the fat ensues; as in fevers attended with\r\ngreat thirst, the fat is quickly taken up. See Obesitas I. 2. 3. 17. Some\r\nhave believed, that the cellular and adipose membranes are different ones;\r\nas no fat is ever deposited in the eye-lids or scrotum, both which places\r\nare very liable to be distended with the mucilaginous fluid of the\r\nanasarca, and with air in Emphysema. Sometimes a gradual absorption of the\r\naccumulated fluid takes place, and the thinner parts being taken up, there\r\nremains a more viscid fluid, or almost a solid in the part, as in some\r\nswelled legs, which can not easily be indented by the pressure of the\r\nfinger, and are called scorbutic. Sometimes the paralysis of the absorbents\r\nis completely removed, and the whole is again taken up into the\r\ncirculation.\r\n\r\nThe Hydrocele is known by a tumor of the scrotum, which is without pain,\r\ngradually produced, with fluctuation, and a degree of pellucidity, when a\r\ncandle is held behind it; it is the most simple incysted dropsy, as it is\r\nnot in general complicated with other diseases, as ascites with schirrous\r\nliver, and hydrocephalus internus, with general debility. The cure of this\r\ndisease is effected by different ways; it consists in discharging the water\r\nby an external aperture; and by so far inflaming the cyst and testicle,\r\nthat they afterwards grow together, and thus prevent in future any\r\nsecretion or effusion of mucus; the disease is thus cured, not by the\r\nrevivescence of the absorbent power of the lymphatics, but by the\r\nprevention of secretion by the adhesion of the vagina to the testis. This I\r\nbelieve is performed with less pain, and is more certainly manageable by\r\ntapping, or discharging the fluid by means of a trocar, and after the\r\nevacuation of it to fill the cyst with a mixture of wine and water for a\r\nfew minutes till the necessary degree of stimulus is produced, and then to\r\nwithdraw it; as recommended by Mr. Earle. See also Medical Commentaries by\r\nDr. Duncan, for 1793.\r\n\r\n12. _Hydrocephalus internus_, or dropsy of the ventricles of the brain, is\r\nfatal to many children, and some adults. When this disease is less in\r\nquantity, it probably produces a fever, termed a nervous fever, and which\r\nis sometimes called a worm fever, according to the opinion of Dr.\r\nGilchrist, in the Scots Medical essays. This fever is attended with great\r\ninirritability, as appears from the dilated pupils of the eyes, in which it\r\ncorresponds with the dropsy of the brain. And the latter disease has its\r\nparoxysms of quick pulse, and in that respect corresponds with other fevers\r\nwith inirritability.\r\n\r\nThe hydrocephalus internus is distinguished from apoplexy by its being\r\nattended with fever, and from nervous fever by the paroxysms being very\r\nirregular, with perfect intermissions many times in a day. In nervous fever\r\nthe pain of the head generally affects the middle of the forehead; in\r\nhydrocephalus internus it is generally on one side of the head. One of the\r\nearliest criterions is the patient being uneasy on raising his head from\r\nthe pillow, and wishing to lie down again immediately; which I suppose is\r\nowing to the pressure of the water on the larger trunks of the\r\nblood-vessels entering the cavity being more intolerable than on the\r\nsmaller ones; for if the larger trunks are compressed, it must\r\ninconvenience the branches also; but if some of the small branches are\r\ncompressed only, the trunks are not so immediately incommoded.\r\n\r\nBlisters on the head, and mercurial ointment externally, with calomel\r\ninternally, are principally recommended in this fatal disease. When the\r\npatient cannot bear to be raised up in bed without great uneasiness, it is\r\na bad symptom. So I believe is deafness, which is commonly mistaken for\r\nstupor. See Class I. 2. 5. 6. And when the dilatation of the pupil of\r\neither eye, or the squinting is very apparent, or the pupils of both eyes\r\nmuch dilated, it is generally fatal. As by stimulating one branch of\r\nlymphatics into inverted motion, another branch is liable to absorb its\r\nfluid more hastily; suppose strong errhines, as common tobacco snuff to\r\nchildren, or one grain of turpeth mineral, (Hydrargyrus vitriolatus), mixed\r\nwith ten or fifteen grains of sugar, was gradually blown up the nostrils?\r\nSee Class I. 3. 2. 1. I have tried common snuff upon two children in this\r\ndisease; one could not be made to sneeze, and the other was too near death\r\nto receive advantage. When the mercurial preparations have produced\r\nsalivation, I believe they may have been of service, but I doubt their good\r\neffect otherwise. In one child I tried the tincture of Digitalis; but it\r\nwas given with too timid a hand, and too late in the disease, to determine\r\nits effects. See Sect. XXIX. 5. 9.\r\n\r\nAs all the above remedies generally fail of success, I think frequent,\r\nalmost hourly, shocks of electricity from very small charges might be\r\npassed through the head in all directions with probability of good event.\r\nAnd the use of the trephine, where the affected side can be distinguished.\r\nSee Strabismus, Class I. 2. 5. 4. When one eye is affected, does the\r\ndisease exist in the ventricule of that side?\r\n\r\n13. _Ascites._ The dropsy of the cavity of the abdomen is known by a tense\r\nswelling of the belly; which does not sound on being struck like the\r\ntympany; and in which a fluctuation can be readily perceived by applying\r\none hand expanded on one side, and striking the tumour on the other.\r\n\r\nEffusions of water into large cavities, as into that of the abdomen or\r\nthorax, or into the ventricules of the brain or pericardium, are more\r\ndifficult to be reabsorbed, than the effusion of fluids into the cellular\r\nmembrane; because one part of this extensive sponge-like system of cells,\r\nwhich connects all the solid parts of the body, may have its power of\r\nabsorption impaired, at the same time that some other part of it may still\r\nretain that power, or perhaps possess it in an increased degree; and as all\r\nthese cells communicate with each other, the fluid, which abounds in one\r\npart of it, can be transferred to another, and thus be reabsorbed into the\r\ncirculation.\r\n\r\nIn the ascites, cream of tartar has sometimes been attended with success; a\r\ndram or two drams are given every hour in a morning till it operates, and\r\nis to be repeated for several days; but the operation of tapping is\r\ngenerally applied to at last. Dr. Sims, in the Memoirs of the Medical\r\nSociety of London, Vol. III. has lately proposed, what he believes to be a\r\nmore successful method of performing this operation, by making a puncture\r\nwith a lancet in the scar of the navel, and leaving it to discharge itself\r\ngradually for several days, without introducing a canula, which he thinks\r\ninjurious both on account of the too sudden emission of the fluid, and the\r\ndanger of wounding or stimulating the viscera. This operation I have twice\r\nknown performed with less inconvenience, and I believe with more benefit to\r\nthe patient, than the common method.\r\n\r\nAfter the patient has been tapped, some have tried injections into the\r\ncavity of the abdomen, but hitherto I believe with ill event. Nor are\r\nexperiments of this kind very promising of success. First because the\r\npatients are generally much debilitated, most frequently by spirituous\r\npotation, and have generally a disease of the liver, or of other viscera.\r\nAnd secondly, because the quantity of inflammation, necessary to prevent\r\nfuture secretion of mucus into the cavity of the abdomen, by uniting the\r\nperitoneum with the intestines or mesentery, as happens in the cure of the\r\nhydrocele, would I suppose generally destroy the patient, either\r\nimmediately, or by the consequence of such adhesions.\r\n\r\nThis however is not the case in respect to the dropsy of the ovarium, or in\r\nthe hydrocele.\r\n\r\n14. _Hydrops thoracis._ The dropsy of the chest commences with loss of\r\nflesh, cold extremities, pale countenance, high coloured urine in small\r\nquantity, and general debility, like many other dropsies. The patient next\r\ncomplains of numbness in the arms, especially when elevated, with pain and\r\ndifficulty of swallowing, and an absolute impossibility of lying down for a\r\nfew minutes, or with sudden starting from sleep, with great difficulty of\r\nbreathing and palpitation of his heart.\r\n\r\nThe numbness of the arms is probably owing more frequently to the increased\r\naction of the pectoral muscles in respiration, whence they are less at\r\nliberty to perform other offices, than to the connexion of nerves mentioned\r\nin Sect. XXIX. 5. 2. The difficulty of swallowing is owing to the\r\ncompression of the oesophagus by the lymph in the chest; and the\r\nimpossibility of breathing in an horizontal posture originates from this,\r\nthat if any parts of the lungs must be rendered useless, the inability of\r\nthe extremities of them must be less inconvenient to respiration; since if\r\nthe upper parts or larger trunks of the air-vessels should be rendered\r\nuseless by the compression of the accumulated lymph, the air could not gain\r\nadmittance to the other parts, and the animal must immediately perish.\r\n\r\nIf the pericardium is the principal seat of the disease, the pulse is quick\r\nand irregular. If only the cavity of the thorax is hydropic, the pulse is\r\nnot quick nor irregular.\r\n\r\nIf one side is more affected than the other, the patient leans most that\r\nway, and has more numbness in that arm.\r\n\r\nThe hydrops thoracis is distinguished from the anasarca pulmonum, as the\r\npatient in the former cannot lie down half a minute; in the latter the\r\ndifficulty of breathing, which occasions him to rise up, comes on more\r\ngradually; as the transition of the lymph in the cellular membranes from\r\none part to another of it is slower, than that of the effused lymph in the\r\ncavity of the chest.\r\n\r\nThe hydrops thoracis is often complicated with fits of convulsive\r\nbreathing; and then it produces a disease for the time very similar to the\r\ncommon periodic asthma, which is perhaps owing to a temporary anasarca of\r\nthe lungs; or to an impaired venous absorption in them. These exacerbations\r\nof difficult breathing are attended with cold extremities, cold breath,\r\ncold tongue, upright posture with the mouth open, and a desire of cold air,\r\nand a quick, weak, intermittent pulse, and contracted hands.\r\n\r\nThese exacerbations recur sometimes every two or three hours, and are\r\nrelieved by opium, a grain every hour for two or three doses, with ether\r\nabout a dram in cold water; and seem to be a convulsion of the muscles of\r\nrespiration induced by the pain of the dyspnea. As in Class III. 1. 1. 9.\r\n\r\nM. M. A grain of dried squill, and a quarter of a grain of blue vitriol\r\nevery hour for six or eight hours, unless it vomit or purge. A grain of\r\nopium. Blisters. Calomel three grains every third day, with infusion of\r\nsenna. Bark. Chalybeates. Puncture in the side.\r\n\r\nCan the fluctuation in the chest be heard by applying the ear to the side,\r\nas Hippocrates asserts? Can it be felt by the hand or by the patient before\r\nthe disease is too great to admit of cure by the paracentesis? Does this\r\ndropsy of the chest often come on after peripneumony? Is it ever cured by\r\nmaking the patient sick by tincture of digitalis? Could it be cured, if on\r\none side only, by the operation of puncture between the ribs, and\r\nafterwards by inflaming the cavity by the admission of air for a time, like\r\nthe cure of the hydrocele; the pleura afterwards adhering wholly to that\r\nlobe of the lungs, so as to prevent any future effusion of mucus?\r\n\r\n15. _Hydrops ovarii._ Dropsy of the ovary is another incysted dropsy, which\r\nseldom admits of cure. It is distinguished from ascites by the tumour and\r\npain, especially at the beginning, occupying one side, and the fluctuation\r\nbeing less distinctly perceptible. When it happens to young subjects it is\r\nless liable to be mistaken for ascites. It affects women of all ages,\r\neither married or virgins; and is produced by cold, fear, hunger, bad food,\r\nand other debilitating causes. I saw an elegant young lady, who was shortly\r\nto have been married to a sensible man, with great prospect of happiness;\r\nwho, on being overturned in a chaise in the night, and obliged to walk two\r\nor three miles in wet, cold, and darkness, became much indisposed, and\r\ngradually afflicted with a swelling and pain on one side of the abdomen;\r\nwhich terminated in a dropsy of the ovary, and destroyed her in two or\r\nthree years. Another young woman I recollect seeing, who was about\r\nseventeen, and being of the very inferior class of people, seemed to have\r\nbeen much weakened by the hardship of a cold floor, and little or no bed,\r\nwith bad food; and who to these evils had to bear the unceasing obloquy of\r\nher neighbours, and the persecution of parish officers.\r\n\r\nThe following is abstracted from a letter of my friend Mr. Power, surgeon,\r\nat Bosworth in Leicestershire, on examining the body of an elderly lady who\r\ndied of this disease, March 29, 1793. \"On opening the abdomen I found a\r\nlarge cyst attached to the left ovarium by an elastic neck as thick as the\r\nlittle finger, and so callous as not to admit of being separated by\r\nscissars without considerable difficulty. The substance of the cyst had an\r\nappearance much resembling the gravid uterus near the full period of\r\ngestation, and was as thick. It had no attachment to the peritonæum, or any\r\nof the viscera, except by the hard callous neck I have mentioned; so that\r\nthe blood must with difficulty have been circulated through it for some\r\ntime. Its texture was extremely tender, being easily perforated with the\r\nfinger, was of a livid red colour, and evidently in a sphacelated state. It\r\ncontained about two gallons of a fluid of the colour of port wine, without\r\nany greater tenacity. It has fallen to my lot to have opened two other\r\npatients, whose deaths were occasioned by incysted dropsy of the ovarium.\r\nIn one of these the ovarium was much enlarged with eight or ten cysts on\r\nits surface, but there was no adhesion formed by any of the cysts to any\r\nother part; nor had the ovarium formed any adhesion with the peritonæum,\r\nthough in a very diseased state. In the other the disease was more simple,\r\nbeing only one cyst, without any attachment but to the ovarium.\r\n\r\n    \"As the ovarium is a part not necessary to life, and dropsies of this\r\n    kind are so generally fatal in the end, I think I shall be induced,\r\n    notwithstanding the hazard attending wounds, which penetrate the cavity\r\n    of the abdomen, to propose the extirpation of the diseased part in the\r\n    first case, which occurs to me, in which I can with precision say, that\r\n    the ovarium is the seat of the disease, and the patient in other\r\n    respects tolerably healthy; as the cavity of the abdomen is often\r\n    opened in other cases without bad consequences.\"\r\n\r\nAn argument, which might further countenance the operation thus proposed by\r\nMr. Power, might be taken from the disease frequently affecting young\r\npersons; from its being generally in these subjects local and primary; and\r\nnot like the ascites, produced or accompanied with other diseased viscera;\r\nand lastly, as it is performed in adult quadrupeds, as old sows, with\r\nsafety, though by awkward operators.\r\n\r\n16. _Anasarca pulmonum._ The dropsy of the cellular membrane of the lungs\r\nis usually connected with that of the other parts of the system. As the\r\ncells of the whole cellular membrane communicate with each other, the\r\nmucaginous fluid, which remains in any part of it for want of due\r\nabsorption, sinks down to the most depending cells; hence the legs swell,\r\nthough the cause of the disease, the deficiency of absorption, may be in\r\nother parts of the system. The lungs however are an exception to this,\r\nsince they are suspended in the cavity of the thorax, and have in\r\nconsequence a depending part of their own.\r\n\r\nThe anasarca of the lungs is known by the difficulty of respiration\r\naccompanied with swelled legs, and with a very irregular pulse. This last\r\ncircumstance has generally been ascribed to a dropsy at the same time\r\nexisting in the pericardium, but is more probably owing to the difficult\r\npassage of the blood through the lungs; because I found on dissection, in\r\none instance, that the most irregular pulse, which I ever attended to, was\r\nowing to very extensive adhesions of the lungs; insomuch that one lobe\r\nintirely adhered to the pleura; and secondly, because this kind of dropsy\r\nof the lungs is so certainly removed for a time along with the anasarca of\r\nthe limbs by the use of digitalis.\r\n\r\nThis medicine, as well as emetic tartar, or squill, when given so as to\r\nproduce sickness, or nausea, or perhaps even without producing either in\r\nany perceptible degree, by affecting the lymphatics of the stomach, so as\r\neither to invert their motion, or to weaken them, increases by reverse\r\nsympathy the action, and consequent absorbent power of these lymphatics,\r\nwhich open into the cellular membrane. But as those medicines seldom\r\nsucceed in producing an absorption of those fluids, which stagnate in the\r\nlarger cavities of the body, as in the abdomen, or chest, and do generally\r\nsucceed in this difficulty of breathing with irregular pulse above\r\ndescribed, I conclude that it is not owing to an effusion of lymph into the\r\npericardium, but simply to an anasarca of the lungs.\r\n\r\nM. M. Digitalis. See Art. V. 2. 1. Tobacco. Squill. Emetic tartar\r\n(antimonium tartarizatum). Then Sorbentia. Chalybeates. Opium half a grain\r\ntwice a day. Raisin wine and water, or other wine and water, is preferred\r\nto the spirit and water, which these patients have generally been\r\naccustomed to.\r\n\r\nThe usual cause of anasarca is from a diseased liver, and hence it most\r\nfrequently attends those, who have drank much fermented or spirituous\r\nliquors; but I suspect that there is another cause of anasarca, which\r\noriginates from the brain; and which is more certainly fatal than that,\r\nwhich originates from a diseased liver. These patients, where the anasarca\r\noriginates from, or commences in, the brain, have not other symptoms of\r\ndiseased liver; have less difficulty of breathing at the beginning; and\r\nhold themselves more upright in their chair, and in walking. In this kind\r\nof dropsy I suspect the digitalis has less or no effect; as it particularly\r\nincreases the absorption from the lungs.\r\n\r\n17. _Obesitas._ Corpulency may be called an anasarca or dropsy of fat,\r\nsince it must be owing to an analogous cause; that is, to the deficient\r\nabsorption of fat compared to the quantity secreted into the cells which\r\ncontain it. See Class II. 1. 1. 4.\r\n\r\nThe method of getting free from too much fat without any injury to the\r\nconstitution, consists, first, in putting on a proper bandage on the belly,\r\nso that it can be tightened or relaxed with ease, as a tightish under\r\nwaistcoat, with a double row of buttons. This is to compress the bowels and\r\nincrease their absorption, and it thus removes one principal cause of\r\ncorpulency, which is the looseness of the skin. Secondly, he should omit\r\none entire meal, as supper; by this long abstinence from food the absorbent\r\nsystem will act on the mucus and fat with greater energy. Thirdly, he\r\nshould drink as little as he can with ease to his sensations; since, if the\r\nabsorbents of the stomach and bowels supply the blood with much, or perhaps\r\ntoo much, aqueous fluid, the absorbents of the cellular membrane will act\r\nwith less energy. Fourthly, he should use much salt or salted meat, which\r\nwill increase the perspiration and make him thirsty; and if he bears this\r\nthirst, the absorption of his fat will be greatly increased, as appears in\r\nfevers and dropsies with thirst; this I believe to be more efficacious than\r\nsoap. Fifthly, he may use aerated alcaline water for his drink, which may\r\nbe supposed to render the fat more fluid,--or he may take soap in large\r\nquantities, which will be decomposed in the stomach. Sixthly, short rest,\r\nand constant exercise.\r\n\r\n18. _Splenis tumor._ Swellings of the spleen, or in its vicinity, are\r\nfrequently perceived by the hand in intermittents, which are called\r\nAgue-cakes, and seem owing to a deficiency of absorption in the affected\r\npart.\r\n\r\nMr. Y----, a young man about twenty-five years of age, who lived\r\nintemperately, was seized with an obstinate intermittent, which had become\r\na continued fever with strong pulse, attended with daily remission. A large\r\nhard tumour on the left side, on the region of the spleen, but extending\r\nmuch more downward, was so distinctly perceptible, that one seemed to get\r\none's fingers under the edge of it, much like the feel of the brawn or\r\nshield on a boar's shoulder. He was repeatedly bled, and purged with\r\ncalomel, had an emetic, and a blister on the part, without diminishing the\r\ntumour; after some time he took the Peruvian bark, and slight doses of\r\nchalybeates, and thus became free from the fever, and went to Bath for\r\nseveral weeks, but the tumour remained. This tumour I examined every four\r\nor five years for above thirty years. His countenance was pale, and towards\r\nthe end of his life he suffered much from ulcers on his legs, and died\r\nabout sixty, of general debility; like many others, who live intemperately\r\nin respect to the ingurgitation of fermented or spirituous liquors.\r\n\r\nAs this tumour commenced in the cold fit of an intermittent fever, and was\r\nnot attended with pain, and continued so long without endangering his life,\r\nthere is reason to believe it was simply occasioned by deficient\r\nabsorption, and not by more energetic action of the vessels which\r\nconstitute the spleen. See Class II. 1. 2. 13.\r\n\r\nM. M. Venesection. Emetic, cathartic with calomel; then sorbentia,\r\nchalybeates, Peruvian bark.\r\n\r\n19. _Genu tumor albus._ White swelling of the knee, is owing to deficient\r\nabsorption of the lymphatics of the membranes including the joint, or\r\ncapsular ligaments, and sometimes perhaps of the gland which secretes the\r\nsynovia; and the ends of the bones are probably affected in consequence.\r\n\r\nI saw an instance, where a caustic had been applied by an empiric on a\r\nlarge white swelling of the knee, and was told, that a fluid had been\r\ndischarged from the joint, which became anchylosed, and healed without loss\r\nof the limb.\r\n\r\nM. M. Repeated blisters on the part early in the disease are said to cure\r\nit by promoting absorption; saturnine solutions externally are recommended.\r\nBark, animal charcoal, as burnt sponge, opium in small doses. Friction with\r\nthe hand.\r\n\r\n20. _Bronchocele._ Swelled throat. An enlargement of the thyroid glands,\r\nsaid to be frequent in mountainous countries, where river water is drank,\r\nwhich has its source from dissolving snows. This idea is a very ancient\r\none, but perhaps not on that account to be the more depended upon, as\r\nauthors copy one another. Tumidum guttur quis miratur in alpibus, seems to\r\nhave been a proverb in the time of Juvenal. The inferior people of Derby\r\nare much subject to this disease, but whether more so than other populous\r\ntowns, I can not determine; certain it is, that they chiefly drink the\r\nwater of the Derwent, which arises in a mountainous country, and is very\r\nfrequently blackened as it passes through the morasses near its source; and\r\nis generally of a darker colour, and attended with a whiter foam, than the\r\nTrent, into which it falls; the greater quantity and whiteness of its froth\r\nI suppose may be owing to the viscidity communicated to it by the colouring\r\nmatter. The lower parts of the town of Derby might be easily supplied with\r\nspring water from St. Alkmond's well; or the whole of it from the abundant\r\nsprings near Bowbridge: the water from which might be conveyed to the town\r\nin hollow bricks, or clay-pipes, at no very great expence, and might be\r\nreceived into frequent reservoirs with pumps to them; or laid into the\r\nhouses.\r\n\r\nM. M. Twenty grains of burnt sponge with ten of nitre made with mucilage\r\ninto lozenges, and permitted to dissolve slowly under the tongue twice a\r\nday, is asserted to cure in a few months; perhaps other animal charcoal, as\r\ncandle-snuffs, might do the same.\r\n\r\nI have directed in the early state of this disease a mixture of common salt\r\nand water to be held in the mouth, particularly under the tongue, for a few\r\nminutes, four or six times a day for many weeks, which has sometimes\r\nsucceeded, the salt and water is then spit out again, or in part swallowed.\r\nExternally vinegar of squills has been applied, or a mercurial plaster, or\r\nfomentations of acetated ammoniac; or ether. Some empirics have applied\r\ncaustics on the bronchocele, and sometimes, I have been told, with success;\r\nwhich should certainly be used where there is danger of suffocation from\r\nthe bulk of it. One case I saw, and one I was well informed of, where the\r\nbronchocele was cured by burnt sponge, and a hectic fever supervened with\r\ncolliquative sweats; but I do not know the final event of either of them.\r\n\r\nDe Haen affirms the cure of bronchocele to be effected by flowers of zinc,\r\ncalcined egg-shells, and scarlet cloth burnt together in a close crucible,\r\nwhich was tried with success, as he assured me, by a late lamented\r\nphysician, my friend, Dr. Small of Birmingham; who to the cultivation of\r\nmodern sciences added the integrity of ancient manners; who in clearness of\r\nhead, and benevolence of heart, had few equals, perhaps no superiors.\r\n\r\n21. _Scrophula._ King's evil is known by tumours of the lymphatic glands,\r\nparticularly of the neck. The upper lip, and division of the nostrils is\r\nswelled, with a florid countenance, a smooth skin, and a tumid abdomen.\r\nCullen. The absorbed fluids in their course to the veins in the scrophula\r\nare arrested in the lymphatic or conglobate glands; which swell, and after\r\na great length of time, inflame and suppurate. Materials of a peculiar\r\nkind, as the variolous and venereal matter, when absorbed in a wound,\r\nproduce this torpor, and consequent inflammation of those lymphatic glands,\r\nwhere they first arrive, as in the axilla and groin. There is reason to\r\nsuspect, that the tonsils frequently become inflamed, and suppurate from\r\nthe matter absorbed from carious teeth; and I saw a young lady, who had\r\nboth the axillary glands swelled, and which suppurated; which was believed\r\nto have been caused by her wearing a pair of new green gloves for one day,\r\nwhen she had perspired much, and was much exhausted and fatigued by\r\nwalking; the gloves were probably dyed in a solution of verditer.\r\n\r\nThese indolent tumours of the lymphatic glands, which constitute the\r\nscrophula, originate from the inirritability of those glands; which\r\ntherefore sooner fall into torpor after having been stimulated too\r\nviolently by some poisonous material; as the muscles of enfeebled people\r\nsooner become fatigued, and cease to act, when exerted, than those of\r\nstronger ones. On the same account these scrophulous glands are much longer\r\nin acquiring increase of motion, after having been stimulated into\r\ninactivity, and either remain years in a state of indolence, or suppurate\r\nwith difficulty, and sometimes only partially.\r\n\r\nThe difference between scrophulous tumours, and those before described,\r\nconsists in this; that in those either glands of different kinds were\r\ndiseased, or the mouths only of the lymphatic glands were become torpid;\r\nwhereas in scrophula the conglobate glands themselves become tumid, and\r\ngenerally suppurate after a great length of time, when they acquire new\r\nsensibility. See Sect. XXXIX. 4. 5.\r\n\r\nThese indolent tumours may be brought to suppurate sometimes by passing\r\nelectric shocks through them every day for two or three weeks, as I have\r\nwitnessed. It is probable, that the alternate application of snow or iced\r\nwater to them, till they become painfully cold, and then of warm flannel or\r\nwarm water, frequently repeated, might restore their irritability by\r\naccumulation of sensorial power; and thence either facilitate their\r\ndispersion, or occasion them to suppurate. See Class II. 1. 4. 13.\r\n\r\nThis disease is very frequent amongst the children of the poor in large\r\ntowns, who are in general ill fed, ill lodged, and ill clothed; and who are\r\nfurther weakened by eating much salt with their scanty meal of insipid\r\nvegetable food, which is seldom of better quality than water gruel, with a\r\nlittle coarse bread in it. See diarrhoea of infants, Class I. 1. 2. 5.\r\nScrophulous ulcers are difficult to heal, which is owing to the deficiency\r\nof absorption on their pale and flabby surfaces, and to the general\r\ninirritability of the system. See Class I. 1. 3. 13.\r\n\r\nM. M. Plentiful diet of flesh-meat and vegetables with small-beer. Opium,\r\nfrom a quarter of a grain to half a grain twice a day. Sorbentia. Tincture\r\nof digitalis, thirty drops twice a day. Externally sea-bathing, or bathing\r\nin salt and water, one pound to three gallons, made warm. The application\r\nof Peruvian bark in fine powder, seven parts, and white lead, (cerussa) in\r\nfine powder one part, mixed together and applied on the ulcers in dry\r\npowder, by means of lint and a bandage, to be renewed every day. Or very\r\nfine powder of calamy alone, lapis calaminaris. If powder of manganese?\r\n\r\n22. _Schirrus._ After the absorbent veins of a gland cease to perform their\r\noffice, if the secerning arteries of it continue to act some time longer,\r\nthe fluids are pushed forwards, and stagnate in the receptacles or\r\ncapillary vessels of the gland; and the thinner part of them only being\r\nresumed by the absorbent system of the gland, a hard tumour gradually\r\nsucceeds; which continues like a lifeless mass, till from some accidental\r\nviolence it gains sensibility, and produces cancer, or suppurates. Of this\r\nkind are the schirrous glands of the breasts, of the lungs, of the\r\nmesentery, and the scrophulous tumours about the neck and the bronchocele.\r\n\r\nAnother seat of schirrus is in the membranous parts of the system, as of\r\nthe rectum intestinum, the urethra, the gula or throat; and of this kind is\r\nthe verucca or wart, and the clavus pedum, or corns on the toes. A wen\r\nsometimes arises on the back of the neck, and sometimes between the\r\nshoulders; and by distending the tendinous fascia produces great and\r\nperpetual pain.\r\n\r\nM. M. Mercurial ointment. Cover the part with oiled silk. Extirpation.\r\nElectric shocks through the tumour. An issue into the substance of the wen.\r\nOpium. Ether externally.\r\n\r\n23. _Schirrus recti intestini._ Schirrus of the rectum. A schirrus\r\nfrequently affects a canal, and by contracting its diameter becomes a\r\npainful and deplorable disease. The canals thus obstructed are the rectum,\r\nthe urethra, the throat, the gall-ducts, and probably the excretory ducts\r\nof the lymphatics, and of other glands.\r\n\r\nThe schirrus of the rectum is known by the patient having pain in the part,\r\nand being only able to part with liquid feces, and by the introduction of\r\nthe finger; the swelled part of the intestine is sometimes protruded\r\ndownwards, and hangs like a valve, smooth and hard to the touch, with an\r\naperture in the centre of it. See a paper on this subject by J. Sherwin.\r\nMemoirs of a London Medical Society, Vol. II. p. 9.\r\n\r\nM. M. To take but little solid food. Aperient medicines. Introduce a candle\r\nsmeared with mercurial ointment. Sponge-tent. Clysters with forty drops of\r\nlaudanum. Introduce a leathern canula, or gut, and then either a wooden\r\nmaundril, or blow it up with air, so as to distend the contracted part as\r\nmuch as the patient can bear. Or spread mercurial plaster on thick soft\r\nleather, and roll it up with the plaster outwards to any thickness and\r\nlength, which can be easily introduced and worn; or two or three such\r\npieces may be introduced after each other. The same may be used to compress\r\nbleeding internal piles. See Class I. 2. 1. 6.\r\n\r\n24. _Schirrus urethræ._ Schirrus of the urethra. The passage becomes\r\ncontracted by the thickened membrane, and the urine is forced through with\r\ngreat difficulty, and is thence liable to distend the canal behind the\r\nstricture; till at length an aperture is made, and the urine forces its way\r\ninto the cellular membrane, making large sinuses. This situation sometimes\r\ncontinues many months, or even years, and so much matter is evacuated after\r\nmaking water, or at the same time, by the action of the muscles in the\r\nvicinity of the sinuses, that it has been mistaken for an increased\r\nsecretion from the bladder, and has been erroneously termed a catarrh of\r\nthe bladder. See a paper by Dr. R. W. Darwin in the Medical Memoirs.\r\n\r\nM. M. Distend the part gradually by catgut bougies, which by their\r\ncompression will at the same time diminish the thickness of the membrane,\r\nor by bougies of elastic gum, or of horn boiled soft. The patient should\r\ngain the habit of making water slowly, which is a matter of the utmost\r\nconsequence, as it prevents the distention, and consequent rupture, of that\r\npart of the urethra, which is between the stricture and the neck of the\r\nbladder.\r\n\r\nWhen there occurs an external ulcer in the perinæum, and the urine is in\r\npart discharged that way, the disease can not be mistaken. Otherwise from\r\nthe quantity of matter, it is generally supposed to come from the bladder,\r\nor prostate gland; and the urine, which escapes from the ruptured urethra,\r\nmines its way amongst the muscles and membranes, and the patient dies\r\ntabid, owing to the want of an external orifice to discharge the matter.\r\nSee Class II. 1. 4. 11.\r\n\r\n25. _Schirrus oesophagi._ A schirrus of the throat contracts the passage so\r\nas to render the swallowing of solids impracticable, and of liquids\r\ndifficult. It affects patients of all ages, but is probably most frequently\r\nproduced by swallowing hard angular substances, when people have lost their\r\nteeth; by which this membrane is over distended, or torn, or otherwise\r\ninjured.\r\n\r\nM. M. Put milk into a bladder tied to a canula or catheter; introduce it\r\npast the stricture, and press it into the stomach. Distend the stricture\r\ngradually by a sponge-tent fastened to the end of whale-bone, or by a plug\r\nof wax, or a spermaceti candle, about two inches long; which might be\r\nintroduced, and left there with a string only fixed to it to hang out of\r\nthe mouth, to keep it in its place, and to retract it by occasionally; for\r\nwhich purpose the string must be put through a catheter or hollow probang,\r\nwhen it is to be retracted. Or lastly introduce a gut fixed to a pipe; and\r\nthen distend it by blowing wind into it. The swallowing a bullet with a\r\nstring put through it, to retract it on the exhibition of an emetic, has\r\nalso been proposed. Externally mercurial ointment has been much\r\nrecommended. Poultice. Oiled silk. Clysters of broth. Warm bath of broth.\r\nTransfusion of blood into a vein three or four ounces a day? See Class III.\r\n1. 1. 15.\r\n\r\nI directed a young woman about twenty-two years of age, to be fed with new\r\nmilk put into a bladder, which was tied to a catheter, and introduced\r\nbeyond the stricture in her throat; after a few days her spirits sunk, and\r\nshe refused to use it further, and died. Above thirty years ago I proposed\r\nto an old gentleman, whose throat was entirely impervious, to supply him\r\nwith a few ounces of blood daily from an ass, or from the human animal, who\r\nis still more patient and tractable, in the following manner. To fix a\r\nsilver pipe about an inch long to each extremity of a chicken's gut, the\r\npart between the two silver ends to be measured by filling it with warm\r\nwater; to put one end into the vein of a person hired for that purpose, so\r\nas to receive the blood returning from the extremity; and when the gut was\r\nquite full, and the blood running through the other silver end, to\r\nintroduce that end into the vein of the patient upwards towards the heart,\r\nso as to admit no air along with the blood. And lastly, to support the gut\r\nand silver ends on a water plate, filled with water of ninety-eight degrees\r\nof heat, and to measure how many ounces of blood was introduced by passing\r\nthe finger, so as to compress the gut, from the receiving pipe to the\r\ndelivering pipe; and thence to determine how many gut-fulls were given from\r\nthe healthy person to the patient. See Class IV. 2. 4. 11. Mr. ----\r\nconsidered a day on this proposal, and then another day, and at length\r\nanswered, that \"he now found himself near the house of death; and that if\r\nhe could return, he was now too old to have much enjoyment of life; and\r\ntherefore he wished rather to proceed to the end of that journey, which he\r\nwas now so near, and which he must at all events soon go, than return for\r\nso short a time.\" He lived but a few days afterwards, and seemed quite\r\ncareless and easy about the matter.\r\n\r\n26. _Lacteorum inirritabilitas._ Inirritability of the lacteals is\r\ndescribed in Sect. XXVIII. under the name of paralysis of the lacteals; but\r\nas the word paralysis has generally been applied to the disobedience of the\r\nmuscles to the power of volition, the name is here changed to\r\ninirritability of the lacteals, as more characteristic of the disease.\r\n\r\n27. _Lymphaticorum inirritabilitas._ The inirritability of the cellular and\r\ncutaneous lymphatics is described in Sect. XXIX. 5. 1. and in Class I. 2.\r\n3. 16. The inirritability of the cutaneous lymphatics generally accompanies\r\nanasarca, and is the cause of the great thirst in that malady. At the same\r\ntime the cellular lymphatics act with greater energy, owing to the greater\r\nderivation of sensorial power to them in consequence of the less\r\nexpenditure of it by the cutaneous ones; and hence they absorb the fat, and\r\nmucus, and also the thinner parts of the urine. Whence the great emaciation\r\nof the body, the muddy sediment, and the small quantity of water in this\r\nkind of dropsy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nORDO II.\r\n\r\n_Decreased Irritation._\r\n\r\nGENUS IV.\r\n\r\n_With Decreased Actions of other Cavities and Membranes._\r\n\r\nMany of the diseases of this genus are attended with pain, and with cold\r\nextremities, both which cease on the exhibition of wine or opium; which\r\nshews, that they originate from deficient action of the affected organ.\r\nThese pains are called nervous or spasmodic, are not attended with fever,\r\nbut are frequently succeeded by convulsions and madness; both which belong\r\nto the class of volition. Some of them return at periods, and when these\r\ncan be ascertained, a much less quantity of opium will prevent them, than\r\nis necessary to cure them, when they are begun; as the vessels are then\r\ntorpid and inirritable from the want of sensorial power, till by their\r\ninaction it becomes again accumulated.\r\n\r\nOur organs of sense properly so called are not liable to pain from the\r\nabsence of their appropriated stimuli, as from darkness or silence; but the\r\nother senses, which may be more properly called appetites, as those by\r\nwhich we perceive heat, hunger, thirst, lust, want of fresh air, are\r\naffected with pain from the defect or absence of their accustomed stimuli,\r\nas well as with pleasure by the possession of them; it is probable that\r\nsome of our glands, whose sense or appetite requires or receives something\r\nfrom the circulating blood, as the pancreas, liver, testes, prostate gland,\r\nmay be affected with aching or pain, when they cannot acquire their\r\nappropriated fluid.\r\n\r\nWherever this defect of stimulus occurs, a torpor or inaction of the organ\r\nensues, as in the capillaries of the skin, when exposed to cold; and in the\r\nglands, which secrete the gastric juice, when we are hungry. This torpor\r\nhowever, and concomitant pain, which is at first owing to defect of\r\nstimulus, is afterwards induced by other associations or catenations, and\r\nconstitutes the beginning of ague fits.\r\n\r\nIt must be further observed, that in the diseases of pain without fever,\r\nthe pain is frequently not felt in the part where the cause of the disease\r\nresides; but is induced by sympathy with a distant part, whose irritability\r\nor sensibility is greater or less than its own. Thus a stone at the neck of\r\nthe bladder, if its stimulus is not very great, only induces the pain of\r\nstrangury at the glans penis. If its stimulus be greater, it then induces\r\npain at the neck of the bladder. The concretions of bile, which are\r\nprotruded into the neck of the gall-bladder, when the disease is not very\r\ngreat, produce pain at the other extremity of the bile-duct, which enters\r\nthe duodenum immediately under the pit of the stomach; but, when the\r\ndisease is great from the largeness of the bile-stone, the pain is felt in\r\nthe region of the liver at the neck of the gall-bladder.\r\n\r\nIt appears from hence, that the pains enumerated in this genus are\r\nconsequences of the inactivity of the organ; and, as they do not occasion\r\nother diseases, should be classed according to their proximate cause, which\r\nis defective irritation; there are nevertheless other pains from defect of\r\nstimulus, which produce convulsions, and belong to Class III. 1. 1.; and\r\nothers, which produce pains of some distant part by association, and belong\r\nto Class IV. 2. 2.\r\n\r\nSPECIES.\r\n\r\n1. _Sitis._ Thirst. The senses of thirst and of hunger seem to have this\r\nconnection, that the former is situated at the upper end, and the latter at\r\nthe lower end of the same canal. One about the pharinx, where the\r\noesophagus opens into the mouth, and the other about the cardia ventriculi,\r\nwhere it opens into the stomach. The extremities of other canals have been\r\nshewn to possess correspondent sensibilities, or irritabilities, as the two\r\nends of the urethra, and of the common gall-duct. See IV. 2. 2. 2. and 4.\r\n\r\nThe membrane of the upper end of the gullet becomes torpid, and\r\nconsequently painful, when there is a deficiency of aqueous fluid in the\r\ngeneral system; it then wants its proper stimulus. In the same manner a\r\nwant of the stimulus of more solid materials at the other end of the canal,\r\nwhich terminates in the stomach, produces hunger; as mentioned in Sect.\r\nXIV. 8. The proximate causes of both of them therefore consist in deficient\r\nirritation, when they are considered as pains; because these pains are in\r\nconsequence of the inactivity of the organ, according to the fifth law of\r\nanimal causation. Sect. IV. 5. But when they are considered as desires,\r\nnamely of liquid or solid aliment, their proximate cause consists in the\r\npain of them, according to the sixth law of animal causation. So the\r\nproximate cause of the pain of coldness is the inactivity of the organ, and\r\nperhaps the consequent accumulation of sensorial power in it; but the pain\r\nitself, or the consequent volition, is the proximate cause of the\r\nshuddering and gnashing the teeth in cold fits of intermittent fevers. See\r\nClass I. 2. 2. 1.\r\n\r\nThirst may be divided into two varieties alluding to the remote cause of\r\neach, and may be termed sitis calida, or warm thirst, and sitis frigida, or\r\ncold thirst. The remote cause of the former arises from the dissipation of\r\nthe aqueous parts of our fluids by the increased secretion of perspirable\r\nmatter, or other evacuations. And hence it occurs in hot fits of fever, and\r\nafter taking much wine, opium, spice, salt, or other drugs of the Art.\r\nincitantia or secernentia. The thirst, which occurs about three hours after\r\neating a couple of red herrings, to a person unaccustomed to salted meat,\r\nis of this kind; the increased action of the cutaneous vessels dissipates\r\nso much of our fluids by insensible perspiration, as to require above two\r\nquarts of water to restore the fluidity of the blood, and to wash the salt\r\nout of the system. See Art. III. 2. 1.\r\n\r\nM. M. Cold water. Vegetable acids. Warm bath.\r\n\r\nThe remote cause of sitis frigida, or cold thirst, is owing to the inaction\r\nof the cutaneous, pulmonary, urinary, and cellular absorbents; whence the\r\nblood is deprived of the great supply of moisture, which it ought to\r\nreceive from the atmosphere, and from the cells of the cellular membrane,\r\nand from other cysts; this cause of thirst exists in dropsies, and in the\r\ncold fits of intermittents. The desire of fluids, like that of solids, is\r\nliable to acquire periods, and may therefore readily become diseased by\r\nindulgence in liquids grateful to the palate.\r\n\r\nOf diseased thirst, the most common is either owing to defect of the action\r\nof the numerous absorbent vessels on the neck of the bladder, in which the\r\npatient makes much paleish water; or to the defective absorption of the\r\nskin and lungs, in which the patient makes but little water, and that\r\nhigh-coloured, and with sediment. In both the tongue and lips are liable to\r\nbecome very dry. The former in its greatest degree attends diabætes, and\r\nthe latter anasarca.\r\n\r\nM. M. Warm water, warm wine, warm bath. Opium. Cold bath. Iced water.\r\nLemonade. Cyder.\r\n\r\n2. _Esuries._ Hunger has been fancifully ascribed to the sides of the\r\nstomach rubbing against each other, and to the increased acidity of the\r\ngastric juice corroding the coats of it. If either of these were the cause\r\nof hunger, inflammation must occur, when they had continued some time; but,\r\non the contrary, coldness and not heat are attendant on hunger; which\r\nevinces, that like thirst it is owing to the inactivity of the membrane,\r\nwhich is the seat of it; while the abundant nerves about the cardia\r\nventriculi, and the pain of hunger being felt in that part, gives great\r\nreason to conclude, that it is there situated.\r\n\r\nThe sense of hunger as well as of thirst is liable to acquire habits in\r\nrespect to the times of its returning painfulness, as well as in respect to\r\nthe quantity required to satiate its appetency, and hence may become\r\ndiseased by indulgence, as well as by want of its appropriate stimulus.\r\nThose who have been accustomed to distend their stomach by large quantities\r\nof animal and vegetable food, and much potation, find a want of distention,\r\nwhen the stomach is empty, which occasions faintness, and is mistaken for\r\nhunger, but which does not appear to be the same sensation. I was well\r\ninformed, that a woman near Lichfield, who eat much animal and vegetable\r\nfood for a wager, affirmed, that since distending her stomach so much, she\r\nhad never felt herself satisfied with food; and had in general taken twice\r\nas much at a meal, as she had been accustomed to, before she eat so much\r\nfor a wager.\r\n\r\n3. _Nausea sicca._ Dry nausea. Consists in a quiescence or torpor of the\r\nmucous or salivary glands, and precedes their inverted motions, described\r\nin nausea humida, Class I. 3. 2. 3. In the same manner as sickness of the\r\nstomach is a quiescence of that organ preceding the action of vomiting, as\r\nexplained in Sect. XXXV. 1. 3. This is sometimes induced by disagreeable\r\ndrugs held in the mouth, at other times of disgustful ideas, and at other\r\ntimes by the association of these actions with those of the stomach; and\r\nthus according to its different proximate causes may belong to this, or to\r\nthe second, or to the fourth class of diseases.\r\n\r\nM. M. Lemonade. Tasteful food. A blister. Warm bath.\r\n\r\n4. _Ægritudo ventriculi._ Sickness of stomach is produced by the quiescence\r\nor inactivity of that organ, as is explained in Sect. XXXV. 1. 3. It\r\nconsists in the state between the usual peristaltic motions of that organ,\r\nin the digestion of our aliment, and the retrograde motions of it in\r\nvomiting; for it is evident, that the direct motions of it from the cardia\r\nto the pylorus must stop, before those in a contrary direction can\r\ncommence. This sickness, like the nausea above described, is sometimes\r\nproduced by disgustful ideas, as when nasty objects are seen, and nasty\r\nstories related, as well as by the exhaustion of the sensorial power by the\r\nstimulus of some emetic drugs, and by the defect of the production of it,\r\nas in enfeebled drunkards.\r\n\r\nSickness may likewise consist in the retrograde motions of the lymphatics\r\nof the stomach, which regurgitate into it the chyle or lymph, which they\r\nhave lately absorbed, as in Class I. 3. 2. 3. It is probable, that these\r\ntwo kinds of sickness may be different sensations, though they have\r\nacquired but one name; as one of them attends hunger, and the other\r\nrepletion; though either of them may possibly be induced by association\r\nwith nauseous ideas.\r\n\r\nM. M. A blister on the back. An emetic. Opium. Crude mercury. Covering the\r\nhead in bed. See Sect. XXV. 16. Class IV. 1. 1. 2. and 3.\r\n\r\n5. _Cardialgia._ Heartburn originates from the inactivity of the stomach,\r\nwhence the aliment, instead of being subdued by digestion, and converted\r\ninto chyle, runs into fermentation, producing acetous acid. Sometimes the\r\ngastric juice itself becomes so acid as to give pain to the upper orifice\r\nof the stomach; these acid contents of the stomach, on falling on a marble\r\nhearth, have been seen to produce an effervescence on it. The pain of heat\r\nat the upper end of the gullet, when any air is brought up from the\r\nfermenting contents of the stomach, is to be ascribed to the sympathy\r\nbetween these two extremities of the oesophagus rather than to the pungency\r\nof the carbonic gas, or fixed air; as the sensation in swallowing that kind\r\nof air in water is of a different kind. See Class I. 3. 1. 3. and IV. 2. 2.\r\n5.\r\n\r\nM. M. This disease arising from indigestion is often very pertinacious, and\r\nafflicting; and attended with emaciation of the body from want of\r\nsufficient chyle. As the saliva swallowed along with our food prevents its\r\nfermentation, as appears by the experiments of Pringle and Macbride, some\r\nfind considerable relief by chewing parched wheat, or mastic, or a lock of\r\nwool, frequently in a day, when the pain occurs, and by swallowing the\r\nsaliva thus effused; a temporary relief is often obtained from antiacids,\r\nas aerated alcaline water, Seltzer's water, calcareous earths, alcaline\r\nsalts made into pills with soap, soap alone, tin, milk, bitters. More\r\npermanent use may be had from such drugs as check fermentation, as acid of\r\nvitriol; but still more permanent relief from such things as invigorate the\r\ndigestion, as a blister on the back; a due quantity of vinous spirit and\r\nwater taken regularly. Steel. Temperance. A sleep after dinner. A waistcoat\r\nmade so tight as slightly to compress the bowels and stomach. A flannel\r\nshirt in winter, not in summer. A less quantity of potation of all kinds.\r\nTen black pepper-corns swallowed after dinner. Half a grain of opium twice\r\na day, or a grain. The food should consist of such things as do not easily\r\nferment, as flesh, shell-fish, sea-biscuit, toasted cheese. I have seen\r\ntoasted cheese brought up from the stomach 24 hours after it had been\r\nswallowed, without apparently having undergone any chemical change. See\r\nClass II. 1. 3. 17. and IV. 1. 2. 13.\r\n\r\n6. _Arthritis Ventriculi._ Sickness of the stomach in gouty cases is\r\nfrequently a consequence of the torpor or inflammation of the liver, and\r\nthen it continues many days or weeks. But when the patient is seized with\r\ngreat pain at the stomach with the sensation of coldness, which they have\r\ncalled an ice-bolt, this is a primary affection of the stomach, and\r\ndestroys the patient in a few hours, owing to the torpor or inaction of\r\nthat viscus so important to life.\r\n\r\nThis primary gout of the stomach, as it is a torpor of that viscus, is\r\nattended with sensation of coldness, and with real defect of heat, in that\r\npart, and may thence be distinguished from the pain occasioned by the\r\npassage of a gall-stone into the duodenum, as well as by the weak pulse,\r\nand cold extremities; to which must be added, that it affects those only,\r\nwho have been long afflicted with the gout, and much debilitated by its\r\nnumerous attacks.\r\n\r\nM. M. Opium. Vinous spirit. Volatile alcali. Spice. Warmth applied\r\nexternally to the stomach by hot cloths or fomentation.\r\n\r\n7. _Colica flatulenta._ The flatulent colic arises from the too great\r\ndistention of the bowel by air, and consequent pain. The cause of this\r\ndisease is the inactivity or want of sufficiently powerful contraction of\r\nthe coats of the bowel, to carry forwards the gas given up by the\r\nfermenting aliment. It is without fever, and generally attended with cold\r\nextremities.\r\n\r\nIt is distinguished, first, from the pain occasioned by the passage of a\r\ngall-stone, as that is felt at the pit of the stomach, and this nearer the\r\nnavel. Secondly, it is distinguished from the colica saturnina, or colic\r\nfrom lead, as that arising from the torpor of the liver, or of some other\r\nviscus, is attended with greater coldness, and with an aching pain; whereas\r\nthe flatulent cholic being owing to distention of the muscles of the bowel,\r\nthe pain is more acute, and the coldness less. Thirdly, it is distinguished\r\nfrom inflammation of the bowels, or ileus, as perpetual vomiting and fever\r\nattend this. Fourthly, it is distinguished from cholera, because that is\r\naccompanied with both vomiting and diarrhoea. And lastly, from the colica\r\nepileptica, or hysteric colic, as that is liable to alternate with\r\nconvulsion, and sometimes with insanity; and returns by periods.\r\n\r\nM. M. Spirit of wine and warm water, one spoonful of each. Opium one grain.\r\nSpice. Volatile alcali. Warm fomentation externally. Rhubarb.\r\n\r\n8. _Colica saturnina._ Colic from lead. The pain is felt about the navel,\r\nis rather of an aching than acute kind at first, which increases after\r\nmeals, and gradually becomes more permanent and more acute. It terminates\r\nin paralysis, frequently of the muscles of the arm, so that the hand hangs\r\ndown, when the arm is extended horizontally. It is not attended with fever,\r\nor increase of heat. The seat of the disease is not well ascertained, it\r\nprobably affects some part of the liver, as a pale bluish countenance and\r\ndeficiency of bile sometimes attends or succeeds it, with consequent\r\nanasarca; but it seems to be caused immediately by a torpor of the\r\nintestine, whether this be a primary or secondary affection, as appears\r\nfrom the constipation of the bowels, which attends it; and is always\r\nproduced in consequence of the great stimulus of lead previously used\r\neither internally for a length of time, or externally on a large surface.\r\n\r\nA delicate young girl, daughter of a dairy farmer, who kept his milk in\r\nleaden cisterns, used to wipe off the cream from the edges of the lead with\r\nher finger; and frequently, as she was fond of cream, licked it from her\r\nfinger. She was seized with the saturnine colic, and semi-paralytic wrists,\r\nand sunk from general debility.\r\n\r\nA feeble woman about 40 years of age sprained her ancle, and bruised her\r\nleg and thigh; and applied by ill advice a solution of lead over the whole\r\nlimb, as a fomentation and poultice for about a fortnight. She was then\r\nseized with the colica saturnina, lost the use of her wrists, and gradually\r\nsunk under a general debility.\r\n\r\nM. M. First opium one or two grains, then a cathartic of senna, jalap, and\r\noil, as soon as the pain is relieved. Oleum ricini. Alum. Oil of almonds. A\r\nblister on the navel. Warm bath. The stimulus of the opium, by restoring to\r\nthe bowel its natural irritability in this case of painful torpor, assists\r\nthe action of the cathartic.\r\n\r\n9. _Tympanitis._ Tympany consists in an elastic tumor of the abdomen, which\r\nsounds on being struck. It is generally attended with costiveness and\r\nemaciation. In one kind the air is said to exist in the bowels, in which\r\ncase the tumor is less equal, and becomes less tense and painful on the\r\nevacuation of air. In the other kind the air exists in the cavity of the\r\nabdomen, and sometimes is in a few days exchanged for water, and the\r\ntympany becomes an ascites.\r\n\r\nAir may be distinguished in the stomach of many people by the sound on\r\nstriking it with the fingers, and comparing the sound with that of a\r\nsimilar percussion on other parts of the bowels; but towards the end of\r\nfevers, and especially in the puerperal fever, a distention of the abdomen\r\nby air is generally a fatal symptom, though the ease, and often\r\ncheerfulness, of the patient vainly flatters the attendants.\r\n\r\nM. M. In the former case a clyster-pipe unarmed may be introduced, and left\r\nsome time in the rectum, to take off the resistance of the sphincter, and\r\nthus discharge the air, as it is produced from the fermenting or putrefying\r\naliment. For this purpose, in a disease somewhat similar in horses, a\r\nperforation is made into the rectum on one side of the sphincter; through\r\nwhich fistula the air, which is produced in such great excess from the\r\nquantity of vegetable food which they take, when their digestions are\r\nimpaired, is perpetually evacuated. In both cases also, balsams, essential\r\noil, spice, bandage on the abdomen, and, to prevent the fermentation of the\r\naliment, acid of vitriol, saliva. See Class I. 2. 4. 5.\r\n\r\n10. _Hypochondriasis._ The hypochondriac disease consists in indigestion\r\nand consequent flatulency, with anxiety or want of pleasureable sensation.\r\nWhen the action of the stomach and bowels is impaired, much gas becomes\r\ngenerated by the fermenting or putrescent aliment, and to this indigestion\r\nis catenated languor, coldness of the skin, and fear. For when the\r\nextremities are cold for too long a time in some weak constitutions,\r\nindigestion is produced by direct sympathy of the skin and the stomach,\r\nwith consequent heart-burn, and flatulency. The same occurs if the skin be\r\nmade cold by fear, as in riding over dangerous roads in winter, and hence\r\nconversely fear is produced by indigestion or torpor of the stomach by\r\nassociation.\r\n\r\nThis disease is confounded with the fear of death, which is an insanity,\r\nand therefore of a totally different nature. It is also confounded with the\r\nhysteric disease, which consists in the retrograde motions of the\r\nalimentary canal, and of some parts of the absorbent system.\r\n\r\nThe hypochondriasis, like chlorosis, is sometimes attended with very quick\r\npulse; which the patient seems to bear so easily in these two maladies,\r\nthat if an accidental cough attends them, they may be mistaken for\r\npulmonary consumption; which is not owing primarily to the debility of the\r\nheart, but to its direct sympathy with the actions of the stomach.\r\n\r\nM. M. Blister. A plaster on the abdomen of Burgundy pitch. Opium a grain\r\ntwice a day. Rhubarb six grains every night. Bark. Steel. Spice.\r\nBath-water. Siesta, or sleep after dinner. Uniform hours of meals. No\r\nliquor stronger than small beer, or wine and water. Gentle exercise on\r\nhorseback in the open air uniformly persisted in. See Cardialgia, I. 2. 4.\r\n5.\r\n\r\n11. _Cephalæa._ Head-ach frequently attends the cold paroxysm of\r\nintermittents; afflicts inebriates the day after intoxication; and many\r\npeople who remain too long in the cold bath. In all which cases there is a\r\ngeneral inaction of the whole system, and as these membranes about the head\r\nhave been more exposed to the variations of heat and cold of the\r\natmosphere, they are more liable to become affected so far as to produce\r\nsensation, than other membranes; which are usually covered either with\r\nclothes, or with muscles, as mentioned in Sect. XXXIII. 2. 10.\r\n\r\nThe promptitude of the membranes about the scalp to sympathize with those\r\nof other parts of the system is so great, that this cephalæa without fever,\r\nor quickness of pulse, is more frequently a secondary than a primary\r\ndisease, and then belongs to Class IV. 2. 2. 7. The hemicrania, or partial\r\nhead-ach, I believe to be almost always a disease from association; though\r\nit is not impossible, but a person may take cold on one side of the head\r\nonly. As some people by sitting always on the same side of the fire in\r\nwinter are liable to render one side more tender than the other, and in\r\nconsequence more subject to pains, which have been erroneously termed\r\nrheumatic. See Class IV. 2. 2. 7. & 8.\r\n\r\nM. M. The method of cure consists in rendering the habit more robust, by\r\ngentle constant exercise in the open air, flesh diet, small beer at meals\r\nwith one glass of wine, regular hours of rest and rising, and of meals. The\r\ncloathing about the head should be warmer during sleep than in the day;\r\nbecause at that time people are more liable to take cold; that is, the\r\nmembranous parts of it are more liable to become torpid. As explained in\r\nSect. XVIII. 15. In respect to medicine, two drams of valerian root in\r\npowder three or four times a day are recommended by Fordyce. The bark.\r\nSteel in moderate quantities. An emetic. A blister. Opium, half a grain\r\ntwice a day. Decayed teeth should be extracted, particularly such as either\r\nache, or are useless. Cold bath between 60 and 70 degrees of heat. Warm\r\nbath of 94 or 98 degrees every day for half an hour during a month. See\r\nClass IV. 2. 2. 7. and 8.\r\n\r\nA solution of arsenic, about the sixteenth part of a grain, is reported to\r\nhave great effect in this disease. It should be taken thrice a day, if it\r\nproduces no griping or sickness, for two or three weeks. A medicine of this\r\nkind is sold under the name of tasteless ague-drops; but a more certain\r\nmethod of ascertaining the quantity is delivered in the subsequent materia\r\nmedica, Art. IV. 2. 6.\r\n\r\n12. _Odontalgia._ Tooth-ach. The pain has been erroneously supposed, where\r\nthere is no inflammation, to be owing to some acrid matter from a carious\r\ntooth stimulating the membrane of the alveolar process into violent action\r\nand consequent pain; but the effect seems to have been mistaken for the\r\ncause, and the decay of the tooth to have been occasioned by the torpor and\r\nconsequent pain of the diseased membrane.\r\n\r\nFirst, because the pain precedes the decay of the tooth in regard to time,\r\nand is liable to recur, frequently for years, without certainly being\r\nsucceeded at last by a carious tooth, as I have repeatedly observed.\r\n\r\nSecondly, because any stimulant drug, as pyrethrum, or oil of cloves,\r\napplied to the tooth, or ether applied externally to the cheek, so far from\r\nincreasing the pain, as they would do if the pained membrane, already acted\r\ntoo strongly, that they frequently give immediate relief like a charm.\r\n\r\nAnd thirdly, because the torpor, or deficient action of the membrane, which\r\nincludes the diseased tooth, occasions the motions of the membranes most\r\nconnected with it, as those of the cheek and temples, to act with less than\r\ntheir natural energy; and hence a coldness of the cheek is perceived easily\r\nby the hand of the patient, comparing it with the other cheek; and the pain\r\nof hemicrania is often produced in the temple of the affected side.\r\n\r\nThis coldness of the cheek in common tooth-ach evinces, that the pain is\r\nnot then caused by inflammation; because in all inflammations so much heat\r\nis produced in the secretions of new vessels and fluids, as to give heat to\r\nthe parts in vicinity. And hence, as soon as the gum swells and inflames\r\nalong with the cheek, heat is produced, and the pain ceases, owing to the\r\nincreased exertions of the torpid membrane, excited by the activity of the\r\nsensorial power of sensation; which previously existed in its passive state\r\nin the painful torpid membrane. See Odontitis, Class II. 1. 4. 7. and IV.\r\n2. 2. 8.\r\n\r\nM. M. If the painful tooth be found, venesection. Then a cathartic.\r\nAfterwards two grains of opium. Camphor and opium, one grain of each held\r\nin the mouth; or a drop or two of oil of cloves put on the painful tooth.\r\nEther. If the tooth has a small hole in it, it should be widened within by\r\nan instrument, and then stopped with leaf-gold, or leaf-lead; but should be\r\nextracted, if much decayed. It is probable that half a small drop of a\r\nstrong solution of arsenic, put carefully into the hollow of a decayed\r\naching tooth, would destroy the nerve without giving any additional pain;\r\nbut this experiment requires great caution, lest any of the solution should\r\ntouch the tongue or gums.\r\n\r\nMuch cold or much heat are equally injurious to the teeth, which are endued\r\nwith a fine sensation of this universal fluid. The best method of\r\npreserving them is by the daily use of a brush, which is not very hard,\r\nwith warm water and fine charcoal dust. A lump of charcoal should be put a\r\nsecond time into the fire till it is red hot, as soon as it becomes cool\r\nthe external ashes should be blown off, and it should be immediately\r\nreduced to fine powder in a mortar, and kept close stopped in a phial. It\r\ntakes away the bad smell from decayed teeth, by washing the mouth with this\r\npowder diffused in water immediately. The putrid smell of decaying stumps\r\nof teeth may be destroyed for a time by washing the mouth with a weak\r\nsolution of alum in water. If the calcareous crust upon the teeth adheres\r\nvery firmly, a fine powder of pumice-stone may be used occasionally, or a\r\ntooth instrument.\r\n\r\nAcid of sea-salt, much diluted, may be used; but this very rarely, and with\r\nthe greatest caution, as in cleaning sea-shells. When the gums are spongy,\r\nthey should be frequently pricked with a lancet. Should black spots in\r\nteeth be cut out? Does the enamel grow again when it has been perforated or\r\nabraded?\r\n\r\n13. _Otalgia._ Ear-ach sometimes continues many days without apparent\r\ninflammation, and is then frequently removed by filling the ear with\r\nlaudanum, or with ether; or even with warm oil, or warm water. See Class\r\nII. 1. 4. 8. This pain of the ear, like hemicrania, is frequently the\r\nconsequence of association with a diseased tooth; in that case the ether\r\nshould be applied to the cheek over the suspected tooth, or a grain of\r\nopium and as much camphor mixed together and applied to the suspected\r\ntooth. In this case the otalgia belongs to the fourth class of diseases.\r\n\r\n14. _Pleurodyne chronica._ Chronical pain of the side. Pains of the\r\nmembranous parts, which are not attended with fever, have acquired the\r\ngeneral name of rheumatic; which should, nevertheless, be restricted to\r\nthose pains which exist only when the parts are in motion, and which have\r\nbeen left after inflammation of them; as described in Class I. 1. 3. 12.\r\nThe pain of the side here mentioned affects many ladies, and may possibly\r\nhave been owing to the pressure of tight stays, which has weakened the\r\naction of the vessels composing some membranous part, as, like the cold\r\nhead-ach, it is attended with present debility; in one patient, a boy about\r\nten years old, it was attended with daily convulsions, and was supposed to\r\nhave originated from worms. The disease is very frequent, and generally\r\nwithstands the use of blisters on the part; but in some cases I have known\r\nit removed by electric shocks repeated every day for a fortnight through\r\nthe affected side.\r\n\r\nPains of the side may be sometimes occasioned by the adhesion of the lungs\r\nto the pleura, after an inflammation of them; or to the adhesion of some\r\nabdominal viscera to their cavity, or to each other; which also are more\r\nliable to affect ladies from the unnatural and ungraceful pressure of tight\r\nstays, or by sitting or lying too long in one posture. But in these cases\r\nthe pain should be more of the smarting, than of the dull kind.\r\n\r\nM. M. Ether. A blister. A plaster of Burgundy pitch. An issue or seton on\r\nthe part. Electric shocks. Friction on the part with oil and camphor. Loose\r\ndress. Frequent change of posture both in the day and night. Internally\r\nopium, valerian, bark.\r\n\r\n15. _Sciatica frigida._ Cold sciatica. The pain along the course of the\r\nsciatic nerve, from the hip quite down to the top of the foot, when it is\r\nnot attended with fever, is improperly termed either rheumatism or gout; as\r\nit occurs without inflammation, is attended with pain when the limb is at\r\nrest; and as the pain attends the course of the nerve, and not the course\r\nof the muscles, or of the fascia, which contains them. The theory of\r\nCotunnius, who believed it to be a dropsy of the sheath of the nerve, which\r\nwas compressed by the accumulated fluid, has not been confirmed by\r\ndissection. The disease seems to consist of a torpor of this sheath of the\r\nnerve, and the pain seems to be in consequence of this torpor. See Class\r\nII. 1. 2. 18.\r\n\r\nM. M. Venesection. A cathartic. And then one grain of calomel and one of\r\nopium every night for ten successive nights. And a blister, at the same\r\ntime, a little above the knee-joint on the outside of the thigh, where the\r\nsciatic nerve is not so deep seated. Warm bath. Cold bath. Cover the limb\r\nwith oiled silk, or with a plaster-bandage of emplastrum de minio.\r\n\r\n16. _Lumbago frigida._ Cold lumbago. When no fever or inflammation attends\r\nthis pain of the loins, and the pain exists without motion, it belongs to\r\nthis genus of diseases, and resembles the pain of the loins in the cold fit\r\nof ague. As these membranes are extensive, and more easily fall into\r\nquiescence, either by sympathy, or when they are primarily affected, this\r\ndisease becomes very afflicting, and of great pertinacity. See Class II. 1.\r\n2. 17.\r\n\r\nM. M. Venesection. A cathartic. Issues on the loins. Adhesive plaster on\r\nthe loins. Blister on the os sacrum. Warm bath. Cold bath. Remove to a\r\nwarmer climate in the winter. Loose dress about the waist. Friction daily\r\nwith oil and camphor.\r\n\r\n17. _Hysteralgia frigida._ Cold pain of the uterus preceding or\r\naccompanying menstruation. It is attended with cold extremities, want of\r\nappetite, and other marks of general debility.\r\n\r\nM. M. A clyster of half a pint of gruel, and 30 drops of laudanum; or a\r\ngrain of opium and six grains of rhubarb every night. To sit over warm\r\nwater, or go into a warm bath.\r\n\r\n18. _Proctalgia frigida._ Cold pain at the bottom of the rectum previous to\r\nthe tumor of the piles, which sometimes extends by sympathy to the loins;\r\nit seems to be similar to the pain at the beginning of menstruation, and is\r\nowing to the torpor or inirritability of the extremity of the alimentary\r\ncanal, or to the obstruction of the blood in its passage through the liver,\r\nwhen that viscus is affected, and its consequent delay in the veins of the\r\nrectum, occasioning tumors of them, and dull sensations of pain.\r\n\r\nM. M. Calomel. A cathartic. Spice. Clyster, with 30 drops of laudanum.\r\nSitting over warm water. If chalybeates after evacuation?

The jaundice of\r\naged people, and which attends some fevers, is believed to be most\r\nfrequently caused by an irritative palsy of the gall-bladder; on which\r\naccount the bile is not pressed from the cyst by its contraction, as in a\r\nparalysis of the urinary bladder.\r\n\r\nA thickening of the coats of the common bile-duct by inflammation or\r\nincreased action of their vessels so as to prevent the passage of the bile\r\ninto the intestine, in the same manner as the membrane, which lines the\r\nnostrils, becomes thickened in catarrh so as to prevent the passage of air\r\nthrough them, is probably another frequent cause of jaundice, especially of\r\nchildren; and generally ceases in about a fortnight, like a common catarrh,\r\nwithout the aid of medicine; which has given rise to the character, which\r\ncharms have obtained in some countries for curing the jaundice of young\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThe spissitude of the bile is another cause of jaundice, as mentioned in\r\nClass I. 1. 3. 8. This also in children is a disease of little danger, as\r\nthe gall-ducts are distensible, and will the easier admit of the exclusion\r\nof gall-stones; but becomes a more serious disease in proportion to the age\r\nof the patient, and his habits of life in respect to spirituous potation.\r\n\r\nA fourth cause of jaundice is the compression of the bile-duct by the\r\nenlargement of an inflamed or schirrous liver; this attends those who have\r\ndrank much spirituous liquor, and is generally succeeded by dropsy and\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nM. M. Repeated emetics. Mild cathartics. Warm bath. Electricity. Bitters.\r\nThen steel, which, when the pain and inflammation is removed by\r\nevacuations, acts like a charm in removing the remainder of the\r\ninflammation, and by promoting the absorption of the new vessels or fluids;\r\nlike the application of any acrid eye-water at the end of ophthalmia; and\r\nthus the thickened coats of the bile-duct become reduced, or the\r\nenlargement of the liver lessened, and a free passage is again opened for\r\nthe bile into the intestine. Ether with yolk of egg is recommended, as\r\nhaving a tendency to dissolve inspissated bile. And a decoction of madder\r\nis recommended for the same purpose; because the bile of animals, whose\r\nfood was mixed with madder, was found always in a dilute state. Aerated\r\nalcaline water, or Seltzer's water. Raw cabbage, and other acrid\r\nvegetables, as water-cresses, mustard. Horses are said to be subject to\r\ninspissated bile, with yellow eyes, in the winter season, and to get well\r\nas soon as they feed on the spring grass.\r\n\r\nThe largest bile-stone I have seen was from a lady, who had parted with it\r\nsome years before, and who had abstained above ten years from all kinds of\r\nvegetable diet to prevent, as she supposed, a colic of her stomach, which\r\nwas probably a pain of the biliary duct; on resuming the use of some\r\nvegetable diet, she recovered a better state of health, and formed no new\r\nbilious concretions.\r\n\r\nA strong aerated alcaline water is sold by J. Schweppe, No. 8,\r\nKing's-street, Holborn. See Class I. 1. 3. 10.\r\n\r\n20. _Pelvis renalis inirritabilitas._ Inirritability of the pelvis of the\r\nkidney. When the nucleus of a stone, whether it be inspissated mucus, or\r\nother matter, is formed in the extremity of any of the tubuli uriniferi,\r\nand being detached from thence falls into the pelvis of the kidney, it is\r\nliable to lodge there from the want of due irritability of the membrane;\r\nand in that situation increases by new appositions of indurated animal\r\nmatter, in the same manner as the stone of the bladder. This is the general\r\ncause of hæmorrhage from the kidney; and of obtuse pain in it on exercise;\r\nor of acute pain, when the stone advances into the ureter.

Dulness of\r\nperception. When the motions of the fibrous extremities of the nerves of\r\nsense are too weak to excite sensation with sufficient quickness and\r\nvigour. The irritative ideas are nevertheless performed, though perhaps in\r\na feeble manner, as such people do not run against a post, or walk into a\r\nwell. There are three other kinds of folly; that from deficient sensation,\r\nfrom deficient volition, and from deficient association, as will be\r\nmentioned in their places. In delirium, reverie, and sleep, the power of\r\nperception is abolished from other causes.\r\n\r\n2. _Visus imminutus._ Diminished vision. In our approach to old age our\r\nvision becomes imperfect, not only from the form of the cornea, which\r\nbecomes less convex, and from its decreased transparency mentioned in Class\r\nI. 2. 3. 26.; but also from the decreased irritability of the optic nerve.\r\nThus, in the inirritative or nervous fever, the pupil of the eye becomes\r\ndilated; which in this, as well as in the dropsy of the brain, is generally\r\na fatal symptom. A part of the cornea as well as a part of the albuginea in\r\nthese fevers is frequently seen during sleep; which is owing to the\r\ninirritability of the retina to light, or to the general paresis of\r\nmuscular action, and in consequence to the less contraction of the\r\nsphincter of the eye, if it may be so called, at that time.\r\n\r\nThere have been instances of some, who could not distinguish certain\r\ncolours; and yet whose eyes, in other respects, were not imperfect. Philos.\r\nTransact. Which seems to have been owing to the want of irritability, or\r\nthe inaptitude to action, of some classes of fibres which compose the\r\nretina. Other permanent defects depend on the diseased state of the\r\nexternal organ. Class I. 1. 3. 14. I. 2. 3. 25. IV. 2. 1. 11.\r\n\r\n3. _Muscæ volitantes._ Dark spots appearing before the eyes, and changing\r\ntheir apparent place with the motions of the eyes, are owing to a temporary\r\ndefect of irritability of those parts of the retina, which have been lately\r\nexposed to more luminous objects than the other parts of it, as explained\r\nin Sect. XL. 2. Hence dark spots are seen on the bed-clothes by patients,\r\nwhen the optic nerve is become less irritable, as in fevers with great\r\ndebility; and the patients are perpetually trying to pick them off with\r\ntheir fingers to discover what they are; for these parts of the retina of\r\nweak people are sooner exhausted by the stimulus of bright colours, and are\r\nlonger in regaining their irritability.\r\n\r\nOther kinds of ocular spectra, as the coloured ones, are also more liable\r\nto remain in the eyes of people debilitated by fevers, and to produce\r\nvarious hallucinations of sight. For after the contraction of a muscle, the\r\nfibres of it continue in the last situation, till some antagonist muscles\r\nare exerted to retract them; whence, when any one is much exhausted by\r\nexercise, or by want of sleep, or in fevers, it is easier to let the fibres\r\nof the retina remain in their last situation, after having been stimulated\r\ninto contraction, than to exert any antagonist fibres to replace them.\r\n\r\nAs the optic nerves at their entrance into the eyes are each of them as\r\nthick as a crow-quill, it appears that a great quantity of sensorial power\r\nis expended during the day in the perpetual activity of our sense of\r\nvision, besides that used in the motions of the eye-balls and eyelids; as\r\nmuch I suppose as is expended in the motions of our arms, which are\r\nsupplied with nerves of about the same diameters. From hence we may\r\nconclude, that the light should be kept from patients in fevers with\r\ndebility, to prevent the unnecessary exhaustion of the sensorial power. And\r\nthat on the same account their rooms should be kept silent as well as dark;\r\nthat they should be at rest in an horizontal posture; and be cooled by a\r\nblast of cool air, or by washing them with cold water, whenever their skins\r\nare warmer than natural.\r\n\r\n4. _Strabismus._ Squinting is generally owing to one eye being less perfect\r\nthan the other; on which account the patient endeavours to hide the worst\r\neye in the shadow of the nose, that his vision by the other may not be\r\nconfused. Calves, which have an hydatide with insects inclosed in it in the\r\nfrontal sinus on one side, turn towards the affected side; because the\r\nvision on that side, by the pressure of the hydatide, becomes less perfect;\r\nand the disease being recent, the animal turns round, expecting to get a\r\nmore distinct view of objects.\r\n\r\nIn the hydrocephalus internus, where both eyes are not become insensible,\r\nthe patient squints with only one eye, and views objects with the other, as\r\nin common strabismus. In this case it may be known on which side the\r\ndisease exists, and that it does not exist on both sides of the brain; in\r\nsuch circumstances, as the patients I believe never recover as they are now\r\ntreated, might it not be adviseable to perforate the cranium over the\r\nventricule of the affected side? which might at least give room and\r\nstimulus to the affected part of the brain?\r\n\r\nM. M. If the squinting has not been confirmed by long habit, and one eye be\r\nnot much worse than the other, a piece of gauze stretched on a circle of\r\nwhale-bone, to cover the best eye in such a manner as to reduce the\r\ndistinctness of vision of this eye to a similar degree of imperfection with\r\nthe other, should be worn some hours every day. Or the better eye should be\r\ntotally darkened by a tin cup covered with black silk for some hours daily,\r\nby which means the better eye will be gradually weakened by the want of\r\nuse, and the worse eye will be gradually strengthened by using it. Covering\r\nan inflamed eye in children for weeks together, is very liable to produce\r\nsquinting, for the same reason.\r\n\r\n5. _Amaurosis._ Gutta serena. Is a blindness from the inirritability of the\r\noptic nerve. It is generally esteemed a palsy of the nerve, but should\r\nrather be deemed the death of it, as paralysis has generally been applied\r\nto a deprivation only of voluntary power. This is a disease of dark eyes\r\nonly, as the cataract is a disease of light eyes only. At the commencement\r\nof this disease, very minute electric shocks should be repeatedly passed\r\nthrough the eyes; such as may be produced by putting one edge of a piece of\r\nsilver the size of a half-crown piece beneath the tongue, and one edge of a\r\npiece of zinc of a similar size between the upper lip and the gum, and then\r\nrepeatedly bringing their exterior edges into contact, by which means very\r\nsmall electric sparks become visible in the eyes. See additional note at\r\nthe end of the first volume, p. 567. and Sect. XIV. 5.\r\n\r\nM. M. Minute electric shocks. A grain of opium, and a quarter of a grain of\r\ncorrosive sublimate of mercury, twice a day for four or six weeks. Blister\r\non the crown of the head.\r\n\r\n6. _Auditus imminutus._ Diminished hearing. Deafness is a frequent symptom\r\nin those inflammatory or sensitive fevers with debility, which are\r\ngenerally called putrid; it attends the general stupor in those fevers, and\r\nis rather esteemed a salutary sign, as during this stupor there is less\r\nexpenditure of sensorial power.\r\n\r\nIn fevers of debility without inflammation, called nervous fevers, I\r\nsuspect deafness to be a bad symptom, arising like the dilated pupil from a\r\npartial paralysis of the nerve of sense. See Class IV. 2. 1. 15.\r\n\r\nNervous fevers are supposed by Dr. Gilchrist to originate from a congestion\r\nof serum or water in some part of the brain, as many of the symptoms are so\r\nsimilar to those of hydrocephalus internus, in which a fluid is accumulated\r\nin the ventricules of the brain; on this idea the inactivity of the optic\r\nor auditory nerves in these fevers may arise from the compression of the\r\neffused fluid; while the torpor attending putrid fever may depend on the\r\nmeninges of the brain being thickened by inflammation, and thus compressing\r\nit; now the new vessels, or the blood, which thickens inflamed parts, is\r\nmore frequently reabsorbed, than the effused fluid from a cavity; and hence\r\nthe stupor in one case is less dangerous than in the other.\r\n\r\nIn inflammatory or sensitive fevers with debility, deafness may sometimes\r\narise from a greater secretion and absorption of the ear-wax, which is very\r\nsimilar to the bile, and is liable to fill the meatus auditorius, when it\r\nis too viscid, as bile obstructs the gall-ducts.\r\n\r\nM. M. In deafness without fever Dr. Darwin applied a cupping-glass on the\r\near with good effect, as described in Phil. Trans. Vol. LXIV. p. 348. Oil,\r\nether, laudanum, dropped into the ears.\r\n\r\n7. _Olfactus imminutus._ Inactivity of the sense of smell. From our habits\r\nof trusting to the art of cookery, and not examining our food by the smell\r\nas other animals do, our sense of smell is less perfect than theirs. See\r\nSect. XVI. 5. Class IV. 2. 1. 16.\r\n\r\nM. M. Mild errhines.\r\n\r\n8. _Gustus imminutus._ Want of taste is very common in fevers, owing\r\nfrequently to the dryness or scurf of the tongue, or external organ of that\r\nsense, rather than to any injury of the nerves of taste. See Class. I. 1.\r\n3. 1. IV. 2. 1. 16.\r\n\r\nM. M. Warm subacid liquids taken frequently.\r\n\r\n9. _Tactus imminutus._ Numbness is frequently complained of in fevers, and\r\nin epilepsy, and the touch is sometimes impaired by the dryness of the\r\ncuticle of the fingers. See Class IV. 2. 1. 16.\r\n\r\nWhen the sense of touch is impaired by the compression of the nerve, as in\r\nsitting long with one thigh crossed over the other, the limb appears\r\nlarger, when we touch it with our hands, which is to be ascribed to the\r\nindistinctness of the sensation of touch, and may be explained in the same\r\nmanner as the apparent largeness of objects seen through a mist. In this\r\nlast case the minute parts of an object, as suppose of a distant boy, are\r\nseen less distinctly, and therefore we instantly conceive them to be\r\nfurther from the eye, and in consequence that the whole subtends a larger\r\nangle, and thus we believe the boy to be a man. So when any one's fingers\r\nare pressed on a benumbed limb, the sensation produced is less than it\r\nshould be, judging from visible circumstances; we therefore conceive, that\r\nsomething intervened between the object and the sense, for it is felt as if\r\na blanket was put between them; and that not being visibly the case, we\r\njudge that the limb is swelled.\r\n\r\nThe sense of touch is also liable to be deceived from the acquired habits\r\nof one part of it acting in the vicinity of another part of it. Thus if the\r\nmiddle finger be crossed over either of the fingers next to it, and a nut\r\nbe felt by the two ends of the fingers so crossed at the same time, the nut\r\nappears as if it was two nuts. And lastly, the sense of touch is liable to\r\nbe deceived by preconceived ideas; which we believe to be excited by\r\nexternal objects, even when we are awake. It has happened to me more than\r\nonce, and I suppose to most others, to have put my hands into an empty\r\nbason standing in an obscure corner of a room to wash them, which I\r\nbelieved to contain cold water, and have instantly perceived a sensation of\r\nwarmth, contrary to that which I expected to have felt.\r\n\r\nIn some paralytic affections, and in cold fits of ague, the sensation of\r\ntouch has been much impaired, and yet that of heat has remained, See Sect.\r\nXIV. 6.\r\n\r\nM. M. Friction alone, or with camphorated oil, warm bath. Ether. Volatile\r\nalcali and water. Internally spice, salt. Incitantia. Secernentia.\r\n\r\n10. _Stupor._ The stupor, which occurs in fevers with debility, is\r\ngenerally esteemed a favourable symptom; which may arise from the less\r\nexpenditure of sensorial power already existing in the brain and nerves, as\r\nmentioned in species 6 of this genus. But if we suppose, that there is a\r\ncontinued production of sensorial power, or an accumulation of it in the\r\ntorpid parts of the system, which is not improbable, because such a\r\nproduction of it continues during sleep, to which stupor is much allied,\r\nthere is still further reason for believing it to be a favourable symptom\r\nin inirritable fevers; and that much injury is often done by blisters and\r\nother powerful stimuli to remove the stupor. See Sect. XII. 7. 8. and\r\nXXXIII. 1. 4.\r\n\r\nDr. Blane in his Croonian Lecture on muscular motion for 1788, among many\r\nother ingenious observations and deductions, relates a curious experiment\r\non salmon, and other fish, and which he repeated upon eels with similar\r\nevent.\r\n\r\n    \"If a fish, immediately upon being taken out of the water, is stunned\r\n    by a violent blow on the head, or by having the head crushed, the\r\n    irritability and sweetness of the muscles will be preserved much\r\n    longer, than if it had been allowed to die with the organs of sense\r\n    entire. This is so well known to fishermen, that they put it in\r\n    practice, in order to make them longer susceptible of the operation\r\n    called _crimping_. A salmon is one of the fish least tenacious of life,\r\n    insomuch, that it will lose all signs of life in less than half an hour\r\n    after it is taken out of the water, if suffered to die without any\r\n    farther injury; but if, immediately after being caught, it receives a\r\n    violent blow on the head, the muscles will shew visible irritability\r\n    for more than twelve hours afterwards.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Blane afterwards well remarks, that \"in those disorders in which the\r\nexercise of the senses is in a great measure destroyed, or suspended, as in\r\nthe hydrocephalus, and apoplectic palsy, it happens not uncommonly, that\r\nthe appetite and digestion are better than in health.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nORDO III.\r\n\r\n_Retrograde Irritative Motions._\r\n\r\nGENUS I.\r\n\r\n_Of the Alimentary Canal._\r\n\r\nThe retrograde motions of our system originate either from defect of\r\nstimulus, or from defect of irritability. Thus sickness is often induced by\r\nhunger, which is a want of stimulus; and from ipecacuanha, in which last\r\ncase it would seem, that the sickness was induced after the violence of the\r\nstimulus was abated, and the consequent torpor had succeeded. Hence spice,\r\nopium, or food relieves sickness.\r\n\r\nThe globus hystericus, salivation, diabætes, and other inversions of motion\r\nattending hysteric paroxysms, seem to depend on the want of irritability of\r\nthose parts of the body, because they are attended with cold extremities,\r\nand general debility, and are relieved by wine, opium, steel, and flesh\r\ndiet; that is, by any additional stimulus.\r\n\r\nWhen the longitudinal muscles are fatigued by long action, or are\r\nhabitually weaker than natural, the antagonist muscles replace the limb by\r\nstretching it in a contrary direction; and as these muscles have had their\r\nactions associated in synchronous tribes, their actions cease together. But\r\nas the hollow muscles propel the fluids, which they contain, by motions\r\nassociated in trains; when one ring is fatigued from its too great\r\ndebility, and brought into retrograde action; the next ring, and the next,\r\nfrom its association in train falls into retrograde action. Which continue\r\nso long as they are excited to act, like the tremors of the hands of infirm\r\npeople, so long as they endeavour to act. Now as these hollow muscles are\r\nperpetually stimulated, these retrograde actions do not cease as the\r\ntremors of the longitudinal muscles, which are generally excited only by\r\nvolition. Whence the retrograde motions of hollow muscles depend on two\r\ncircumstances, in which they differ from the longitudinal muscles, namely,\r\ntheir motions being associated in trains, and their being subject to\r\nperpetual stimulus. For further elucidation of the cause of this curious\r\nsource of diseases, see Sect. XXIX. 11. 5.\r\n\r\nThe fluids disgorged by the retrograde motions of the various vascular\r\nmuscles may be distinguished, 1. From those, which are produced by\r\nsecretion, by their not being attended by increase of heat, which always\r\naccompanies increased secretion. 2. They may be distinguished from those\r\nfluids, which are the consequence of deficient absorption, by their not\r\npossessing the saline acrimony, which those fluids possess; which inflames\r\nthe skin or other membranes on which they fall; and which have a saline\r\ntaste to the tongue. 3. They may be distinguished from those fluids, which\r\nare the consequence both of increased secretion and absorption, as these\r\nare attended with increase of warmth, and are inspissated by the\r\nabstraction of their aqueous parts. 4. Where chyle, or milk, are found in\r\nthe feces or urine, or when other fluids, as matter, are translated from\r\none part of the system to another, they have been the product of retrograde\r\naction of lymphatic or other canals. As explained in Sect. XXIX. 8.\r\n\r\nSPECIES.\r\n\r\n1. _Ruminatio._ In the rumination of horned cattle the retrograde motions\r\nof the oesophagus are visible to the eye, as they bring up the softened\r\ngrass from their first stomach. The vegetable aliment in the first stomach\r\nof cattle, which have filled themselves too full of young clover, is liable\r\nto run into fermentation, and distend the stomach, so as to preclude its\r\nexit, and frequently to destroy the animal. To discharge this air the\r\nfarmers frequently make an opening into the stomach of the animal with\r\nsuccess. I was informed, I believe by the late Dr. Whytt of Edinburgh, that\r\nof twenty cows in this situation two had died, and that he directed a pint\r\nof gin or whisky, mixed with an equal quantity of water, to be given to the\r\nother eighteen; all of which eructed immense quantities of air, and\r\nrecovered.\r\n\r\nThere are histories of ruminating men, and who have taken pleasure in the\r\nact of chewing their food a second time. Philos. Transact.\r\n\r\n2. _Ructus._ Eructation. An inverted motion of the stomach excluding\r\nthrough its upper valve an elastic vapour generated by the fermentation of\r\nthe aliment; which proceeds so hastily, that the digestive power does not\r\nsubdue it. This is sometimes acquired by habit, so that some people can\r\neruct when they please, and as long as they please; and there is gas enough\r\ngenerated to supply them for this purpose; for by Dr. Hale's experiments,\r\nan apple, and many other kinds of aliment, give up above six hundred times\r\ntheir own bulk of an elastic gas in fermentation. When people voluntarily\r\neject the fixable air from their stomachs, the fermentation of the aliment\r\nproceeds the faster; for stopping the vessels, which contain new wines,\r\nretards their fermentation, and opening them again accelerates it; hence\r\nwhere the digestion is impaired, and the stomach somewhat distended with\r\nair, it is better to restrain than to encourage eructations, except the\r\nquantity makes it necessary. When wine is confined in bottles the\r\nfermentation still proceeds slowly even for years, till all the sugar is\r\nconverted into spirit; but in the process of digestion, the saccharine part\r\nis absorbed in the form of chyle by the bibulous mouths of the numerous\r\nlacteals, before it has time to run into the vinous fermentation.\r\n\r\n3. _Apepsia._ Indigestion. Water-qualm. A few mouthfuls of the aliment are\r\nrejected at a time for some hours after meals. When the aliment has had\r\ntime to ferment, and become acid, it produces cardialgia, or heart-burn.\r\nThis disease is perhaps generally left after a slight inflammation of the\r\nstomach, called a surfeit, occasioned by drinking cold liquors, or eating\r\ncold vegetables, when heated with exercise. This inflammation of the\r\nstomach is frequently, I believe, at its commencement removed by a critical\r\neruption on the face, which differs in its appearance as well as in its\r\ncause from the gutta rosea of drunkards, as the skin round the base of each\r\neruption is less inflamed. See Class II. 1. 4. 6.. This disease differs\r\nfrom Cardialgia, Class I. 2. 4. 5. in its being not uniformly attended with\r\npain of the cardia ventriculi, and from its retrograde motions of a part of\r\nthe stomach about the upper orifice of it. In the same manner as hysteria\r\ndiffers from hypochondriasis; the one consisting in the weakness and\r\nindigestion of the same portions of the alimentary canal, and the other in\r\nthe inverted motions of some parts of it. This apepsia or water-qualm\r\ncontinues many years, even to old age; Mr. G---- of Lichfield suffered\r\nunder this disease from his infancy; and, as he grew old, found relief only\r\nfrom repeated doses of opium.\r\n\r\nM. M. A blister, rhubarb, a grain of opium twice a day. Soap, iron-powder.\r\nTin-powder.\r\n\r\n4. _Vomitus._ An inverted order of the motions of the stomach and\r\noesophagus with their absorbent vessels, by which their contents are\r\nevacuated. In the act of vomiting less sensorial power is employed than in\r\nthe usual peristaltic motion of the stomach, as explained in Sect. XXXV. 1.\r\n3. Whence after the operation of an emetic the digestion becomes stronger\r\nby an accumulation of sensorial power during its decreased action. This\r\ndecreased action of the stomach may be either induced by want of stimulus,\r\nas in the sickness which attends hunger; or it may be induced by temporary\r\nwant of irritability, as in cold fits of fever; or from habitual want of\r\nirritability, as the vomiting of enfeebled drunkards. Or lastly, by having\r\nbeen previously too violently stimulated by an emetic drug, as by\r\nipecacuanha.\r\n\r\nM. M. A blister. An emetic. Opium. Warmth of a bed, covering the face for a\r\nwhile with the bed-clothes. Crude mercury. A poultice with opium or\r\ntheriaca externally.\r\n\r\n5. _Cholera._ When not only the stomach, as in the last article, but also\r\nthe duodenum, and ilium, as low as the valve of the colon, have their\r\nmotions inverted; and great quantities of bile are thus poured into the\r\nstomach; while at the same time some branches of the lacteals become\r\nretrograde, and disgorge their contents into the upper part of the\r\nalimentary canal; and other branches of them disgorge their contents into\r\nthe lower parts of it beneath the valve of the colon; a vomiting and\r\npurging commence together, which is called cholera, as it is supposed to\r\nhave its origin from increased secretion of bile; but I suppose more\r\nfrequently arises from putrid food, or poisonous drugs, as in the case\r\nnarrated in Sect. XXV. 13. where other circumstances of this disease are\r\nexplained. See Class II. 1. 2. 11.\r\n\r\nThe cramps of the legs, which are liable to attend cholera, are explained\r\nin Class III. 1. 1. 14.\r\n\r\n6. _Ileus._ Consists in the inverted motions of the whole intestinal canal,\r\nfrom the mouth to the anus; and of the lacteals and absorbents which arise\r\nfrom it. In this pitiable disease, through the valve of the colon, through\r\nthe pylorus, the cardia, and the pharinx, are ejected, first, the contents\r\nof the stomach and intestines, with the excrement and even clysters\r\nthemselves; then the fluid from the lacteals, which is now poured into the\r\nintestines by their retrograde motions, is thrown up by the mouth; and,\r\nlastly, every fluid, which is absorbed by the other lymphatic branches,\r\nfrom the cellular membrane, the skin, the bladder, and all other cavities\r\nof the body; and which is then poured into the stomach or intestines by the\r\nretrograde motions of the lacteals; all which supply that amazing quantity\r\nof fluid, which is in this disease continually ejected by vomiting. See\r\nSect. XXV. 15. for a further explanation of this disease.\r\n\r\nM. M. Copious venesection. Twenty grains of calomel in small pills, or one\r\ngrain of aloe every hour till stools are procured. Blisters. Warm bath.\r\nCrude mercury. Clyster of ice-water. Smear the skin all over with grease,\r\nas mentioned in Sect. XXV. 15.\r\n\r\nAs this malady is occasioned sometimes by an introsusception of a part of\r\nthe intestine into another part of it, especially in children, could\r\nholding them up by their heels for a second or two of time be of service\r\nafter venesection? Or the exhibition of crude quicksilver two ounces every\r\nhalf hour, till a pound is taken, be particularly serviceable in this\r\ncircumstance? Or could half a pound, or a pound, of crude mercury be\r\ninjected as a clyster, the patient being elevated by the knees and thighs\r\nso as to have his head and shoulders much lower than his bottom, or even\r\nfor a short time held up by the heels? Could this also be of advantage in\r\nstrangulated hernia?\r\n\r\nWhere the disease is owing to strangulated hernia, the part should be\r\nsprinkled with cold water, or iced water, or salt and water recently mixed,\r\nor moistened with ether. In cases of strangulated hernia, could\r\nacupuncture, or puncture with a capillary trocar, be used with safety and\r\nadvantage to give exit to air contained in the strangulated bowel? Or to\r\nstimulate it into action? It is not uncommon for bashful men to conceal\r\ntheir being afflicted with a small hernia, which is the cause of their\r\ndeath; this circumstance should therefore always be enquired into. Is the\r\nseat or cause of the ileus always below the valve of the colon, and that of\r\nthe cholera above it? See Class II. 1. 2. 11.\r\n\r\n7. _Globus hystericus._ Hysteric suffocation is the perception of a globe\r\nrolling round in the abdomen, and ascending to the stomach and throat, and\r\nthere inducing strangulation. It consists of an ineffectual inversion of\r\nthe motions of the oesophagus, and other parts of the alimentary canal;\r\nnothing being rejected from the stomach.\r\n\r\nM. M. Tincture of castor. Tinct. of opium of each 15 drops. See Hysteria,\r\nClass I. 3. 1. 10.\r\n\r\n8. _Vomendi conamen inane._ An ineffectual effort to vomit. It frequently\r\noccurs, when the stomach is empty, and in some cases continues many hours;\r\nbut as the lymphatics of the stomach are not inverted at the same time,\r\nthere is no supply of materials to be ejected; it is sometimes a symptom of\r\nhysteria, but more frequently attends irregular epilepsies or reveries;\r\nwhich however may be distinguished by their violence of exertion, for the\r\nexertions of hysteric motions are feeble, as they are caused by debility;\r\nbut those of epilepsies, as they are used to relieve pain, are of the most\r\nviolent kind; insomuch that those who have once seen these ineffectual\r\nefforts to vomit in some epilepsies, can never again mistake them for\r\nsymptoms of hysteria. See a case in Sect. XIX. 2.\r\n\r\nM. M. Blister. Opium. Crude mercury.\r\n\r\n9. _Borborigmus._ A gurgling of the bowels proceeds from a partial\r\ninvertion of the peristaltic motions of them, by which the gas is brought\r\ninto a superior part of the bowel, and bubbles through the descending\r\nfluid, like air rushing into a bottle as the water is poured out of it.\r\nThis is sometimes a distressing symptom of the debility of the bowels\r\njoined with a partial inversion of their motions. I attended a young lady\r\nabout sixteen, who was in other respects feeble, whose bowels almost\r\nincessantly made a gurgling noise so loud as to be heard at a considerable\r\ndistance, and to attract the notice of all who were near her. As this noise\r\nnever ceased a minute together for many hours in a day, it could not be\r\nproduced by the uniform descent of water, and ascent of air through it, but\r\nthere must have been alternately a retrograde movement of a part of the\r\nbowel, which must again have pushed up the water above the air; or which\r\nmight raise a part of the bowel, in which the fluid was lodged, alternately\r\nabove and below another portion of it; which might readily happen in some\r\nof the curvatures of the smaller intestines, the air in which might be\r\nmoved backward and forward like the air-bubble in a glass-level.\r\n\r\nM. M. Essential oil. Ten corns of black pepper swallowed whole after\r\ndinner, that its effect might be slower and more permanent; a small pipe\r\noccasionally introduced into the rectum to facilitate the escape of the\r\nair. Crude mercury. See Class I. 2. 4. 9.\r\n\r\n10. _Hysteria._ The three last articles, together with the lymphatic\r\ndiabætes, are the most common symptoms of the hysteric disease; to which\r\nsometimes is added the lymphatic salivation, and fits of syncope, or\r\nconvulsion, with palpitation of the heart (which probably consists of\r\nretrograde motions of it), and a great fear of dying. Which last\r\ncircumstance distinguishes these convulsions from the epileptic ones with\r\ngreater certainty than any other single symptom. The pale copious urine,\r\ncold skin, palpitation, and trembling, are the symptoms excited by great\r\nfear. Hence in hysteric diseases, when these symptoms occur, the fear,\r\nwhich has been usually associated with them, recurs at the same time, as in\r\nhypochondriasis, Class I. 2. 4. 10. See Sect. XVI. 8. 1.\r\n\r\nThe convulsions which sometimes attend the hysteric disease, are exertions\r\nto relieve pain, either of some torpid, or of some retrograde organ; and in\r\nthis respect they resemble epileptic convulsions, except that they are\r\nseldom so violent as entirely to produce insensibility to external stimuli;\r\nfor these weaker pains cease before the total exhaustion of sensorial power\r\nis produced, and the patient sinks into imperfect syncope; whereas the true\r\nepilepsy generally terminates in temporary apoplexy, with perfect\r\ninsensibility to external objects. These convulsions are less to be dreaded\r\nthan the epileptic ones, as they do not originate from so permanent a\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nThe great discharge of pale urine in this disease is owing to the inverted\r\nmotions of the lymphatics, which arise about the neck of the bladder, as\r\ndescribed in Sect. XXIX. 4. 5. And the lymphatic salivation arises from the\r\ninverted motions of the salivary lymphatics.\r\n\r\nHysteria is distinguished from hypochondriasis, as in the latter there are\r\nno retrograde motions of the alimentary canal, but simply a debility or\r\ninirritability of it, with distention and flatulency. It is distinguished\r\nfrom apepsia and cardialgia by there being nothing ejected from the stomach\r\nby the retrograde motions of it, or of the oesophagus.\r\n\r\nM. M. Opium. Camphor. Assafoetida. Castor, with sinapisms externally; to\r\nwhich must be added a clyster of cold water, or iced water; which,\r\naccording to Mons. Pomme, relieves these hysteric symptoms instantaneously\r\nlike a charm; which it may effect by checking the inverted motions of the\r\nintestinal canal by the torpor occasioned by cold; or one end of the\r\nintestinal canal may become strengthened, and regain its peristaltic motion\r\nby reverse sympathy, when the other end is rendered torpid by ice-water.\r\n(Pomme des Affections Vaporeuses, p. 25.) These remove the present\r\nsymptoms; and bark, steel, exercise, coldish bath, prevent their returns.\r\nSee Art. VI. 2. 1.\r\n\r\n11. _Hydrophobia._ Dread of water occasioned by the bite of a mad dog, is a\r\nviolent inversion of the motions of the oesophagus on the contact or even\r\napproach of water or other fluids. The pharinx seems to have acquired the\r\nsensibility of the larinx in this disease, and is as impatient to reject\r\nany fluid, which gets into it. Is not the cardia ventriculi the seat of\r\nthis disease? As in cardialgia the pain is often felt in the pharinx, when\r\nthe acid material stimulates the other end of the canal, which terminates\r\nin the stomach. As this fatal disease resembles tetanus, or locked jaw, in\r\nits tendency to convulsion from a distant wound, and affects some other\r\nparts by association, it is treated of in Class III. 1. 1. 15. and IV. 1.\r\n2. 7.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nORDO III.\r\n\r\n_Retrograde Irritative Motions._\r\n\r\nGENUS II.\r\n\r\n_Of the Absorbent System._\r\n\r\nSPECIES.\r\n\r\n1. _Catarrhus lymphaticus._ Lymphatic catarrh. A periodical defluxion of a\r\nthin fluid from the nostrils, for a few hours, occasioned by the retrograde\r\nmotions of their lymphatics; which may probably be supplied with fluid by\r\nthe increased absorption of some other lymphatic branches in their\r\nvicinity. It is distinguished from that mucous discharge, which happens in\r\nfrosty weather from decreased absorption, because it is less salt to the\r\ntaste; and from an increased secretion of mucus, because it is neither so\r\nviscid, nor is attended with heat of the part. This complaint is liable to\r\nrecur at diurnal periods, like an intermittent fever, for weeks and months\r\ntogether, with great sneezing and very copious discharge for an hour or\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\nI have seen two of these cases, both of which occurred in delicate women,\r\nand seemed an appendage to other hysteric symptoms; whence I concluded,\r\nthat the discharge was occasioned by the inverted motions of the lymphatics\r\nof the nostrils, like the pale urine in hysteric cases; and that they might\r\nreceive this fluid from some other branches of lymphatic vessels opening\r\ninto the frontal or maxillary cavities in their vicinity.\r\n\r\nCould such a discharge be produced by strong errhines, and excite an\r\nabsorption of the congestion of lymph in the dropsy of the brain?\r\n\r\n2. _Salivatio lymphatica._ Lymphatic salivation. A copious expuition of a\r\npellucid insipid fluid, occasioned by the retrograde motions of the\r\nlymphatics of the mouth. It is sometimes periodical, and often attends the\r\nhysteric disease, and nervous fevers; but is not accompanied with a saline\r\ntaste, or with heat of the mouth, or nausea.\r\n\r\n3. _Nausea humida._ Moist nausea consists in a discharge of fluid, owing to\r\nthe retrograde motions of the lymphatics about the fauces, without increase\r\nof heat, or saline taste, together with some retrograde motions of the\r\nfauces or pharinx; along with this nausea a sickness generally precedes the\r\nact of vomiting; which may consist of a similar discharge of mucus or chyle\r\ninto the stomach by the retrograde motions of the lymphatics or lacteals,\r\nwhich open into it. See Class I. 2. 4. 3. and I. 2. 4. 4.\r\n\r\nM. M. Subacid liquids. Wine. Opium. A blister.\r\n\r\n4. _Diarrhoea lymphatica._ Lymphatic diarrhoea. A quantity of mucus and\r\nlymph are poured into the intestines by the inverted motions of the\r\nintestinal lymphatics. The feces are less fetid and more liquid; and it\r\nsometimes portends the commencement of a diabætes, or dropsy, or their\r\ntemporary relief. This lymphatic diarrhoea sometimes becomes chronical, in\r\nwhich the atmospheric moisture, absorbed by the cutaneous and pulmonary\r\nlymphatics, is poured into the intestines by the retrograde motions of the\r\nlacteals. See Section XXIX. 4. 6. where some cases of this kind are\r\nrelated.\r\n\r\n5. _Diarrhoea chylifera, coeliaca._ Chyliferous diarrhoea. The chyle drank\r\nup by the lacteals of the upper intestines is poured into the lower ones by\r\nthe retrograde motions of their lacteals, and appears in the dejections.\r\nThis circumstance occurs at the beginning of diarrhoea crapulosa, where the\r\npatient has taken and digested more aliment than the system can\r\nconveniently receive, and thus eliminates a part of it; as appears when\r\nthere is curdled chyle in some of the dejections. See Sect. XXIX. 4. 7. It\r\ndiffers from the lymphatic diarrhoea, as the chyliferous diabætes differs\r\nfrom the aqueous and mucaginous diabætes.\r\n\r\n6. _Diabætes._ By the retrograde motions of the urinary lymphatics, an\r\nimmense quantity of fluid is poured into the bladder. It is either termed\r\nchyliferous, or aqueous, or mucaginous, from the nature of the fluid\r\nbrought into the bladder; and is either a temporary disease, as in hysteric\r\nwomen, in the beginning of intoxication, in worm cases, or in those exposed\r\nto cold damp air, or to great fear, or anxiety, or in the commencement of\r\nsome dropsies; or it becomes chronical.\r\n\r\nWhen the urinary lymphatics invert their motions, and pour their refluent\r\ncontents into the bladder, some other branch of the absorbent system acts\r\nwith greater energy to supply this fluid. If it is the intestinal branch,\r\nthe chyliferous diabætes is produced: if it is the cutaneous or pulmonary\r\nbranch, the aqueous diabætes is produced: and if the cellular or cystic\r\nbranches, the mucaginous diabætes. In the two last the urine is pellucid,\r\nand contains no sugar.\r\n\r\nIn dropsies the fluid is sometimes absorbed, and poured into the bladder by\r\nthe retrograde motions of the urinary lymphatics, as during the exhibition\r\nof digitalis. In the beginning of the dropsies of infirm gouty patients, I\r\nhave frequently observed, that they make a large quantity of water for one\r\nnight, which relieves them for several days. In these cases the patient\r\npreviously feels a fulness about the precordia, with difficult respiration,\r\nand symptoms similar to those of hysteria. Perhaps a previous defect of\r\nabsorption takes place in some part of the body in those hysteric cases,\r\nwhich are relieved by a copious discharge of pale urine. See Diabætes\r\nexplained at large, Section XXIX. 4.\r\n\r\nA discharge of blood sometimes attends the diabætes, which was occasionally\r\na symptom of that disease in Mr. Brindley, the great navigable canal maker\r\nin this country. Which may be accounted for by the communication of a\r\nlymphatic branch with the gastric branch of the vena portarum, as\r\ndiscovered by J. F. Meckel. See Section XXVII. 2.\r\n\r\nM. M. Alum. Earth of Alum. Cantharides. Calomel. Bark. Steel. Rosin. Opium.\r\nSee Sect. XXIX. 4.\r\n\r\n7. _Sudor lymphaticus._ Profuse sweats from the inverted motions of the\r\ncutaneous lymphatics, as in some fainting fits, and at the approach of\r\ndeath; and as perhaps in the sudor anglicanus. See Sect. XXIX. 5. These\r\nsweats are glutinous to the touch, and without increased heat of the skin;\r\nif the part is not covered, the skin becomes cold from the evaporation of\r\nthe fluid. These sweats without heat sometimes occur in the act of\r\nvomiting, as in Sect. XXV. 9. and are probably the cause of the cold sweaty\r\nhands of some people. As mentioned in Sect. XXIX. 4. 9. in the case of R.\r\nDavis, which he cured by frequent application of lime. Though it is\r\npossible, that cold sweaty hands may also arise from the want of due\r\nabsorption of the perspirable matter effused on them, and that the coldness\r\nmay be owing to the greater evaporation in consequence.\r\n\r\nThe acid sweats described by Dr. Dobson, which he observed in a diabætic\r\npatient, and ascribes to the chyle effused on the skin, must be ascribed to\r\nthe retrograde action of the cutaneous lymphatics. See Sect. XXIX. 6.\r\n\r\n8. _Sudor asthmaticus._ The cold sweats in this disease only cover the\r\nhead, arms, and breast, and are frequently exceedingly profuse. These\r\nsweats are owing to the inverted motions of the cutaneous lymphatics of the\r\nupper part of the body, and at the same time the increased absorption of\r\nthe pulmonary absorbents: hence these sweats when profuse relieve the\r\npresent fit of asthma. There is no other way to account for sweats\r\nappearing on the upper parts of the body only, but by the fluid having been\r\nabsorbed by the lymphatic branch of the lungs, and effused on the skin by\r\nthe retrograde movements of the cutaneous lymphatics; which join those of\r\nthe lungs before they enter into the venous circulation. For if they were\r\noccasioned, as generally supposed, by the difficulty of the circulation of\r\nthe blood through the lungs, the whole skin must be equally affected, both\r\nof the upper and lower parts of the body; for whatever could obstruct the\r\ncirculation in the upper part of the venous system, must equally obstruct\r\nit in the lower part of it. See Sect. XXIX. 6. In the convulsive asthma\r\nthese sweats do not occur; hence they may be distinguished; and might be\r\ncalled the hydropic asthma, and the epileptic asthma.\r\n\r\n9. _Translatio puris._ Translation of matter from one part of the system to\r\nanother can only be explained from its being absorbed by one branch of the\r\nlymphatic system, and deposited in a distant part by the retrograde motions\r\nof another branch; as mentioned Sect. XXIX. 7. 1. It is curious, that these\r\ntranslations of matter are attended generally, I believe, with cold fits;\r\nfor less heat is produced during the retrograde action of this part of the\r\nsystem, as no secretion in the lymphatic glands of the affected branches\r\ncan exist at the same time. Do any ineffectual retrograde motions occasion\r\nthe cold fits of agues? The time when the gout of the liver ceases, and the\r\ngout in the foot commences, is attended with a cold fit, as I have observed\r\nin two instances, which is difficult to explain, without supposing the new\r\nvessels, or the matter produced on the inflamed liver, to be absorbed, and\r\neither eliminated by some retrograde motion, or carried to the newly\r\ninflamed part? See Class IV. 1. 2. 15.\r\n\r\n10. _Translatio lactis._ Translation of milk to the bowels in puerperal\r\nfevers can only be explained by the milk being absorbed by the pectoral\r\nbranch of lymphatics, and carried to the bowels by the retrograde motions\r\nof the intestinal lymphatics or lacteals. See many instances of this in\r\nSect. XXIX. 7. 4.\r\n\r\n11. _Translatio urinæ._ Translation of urine. There is a curious case\r\nrelated in the Transaction of the College of Physicians at Philadelphia,\r\nVol. I. p. 96. of a girl, who labouring under an iscuria vomited her urine\r\nfor many months; which could not be distinguished from that which was at\r\nother times drawn off by the catheter. After having taken much opium, she\r\nseems at length to have formed gravel, some of which was frequently brought\r\nup by vomiting. Dr. Senter ascribes this to the retrograde motions of the\r\nlymphatics of the stomach, and the increased ones of those of the bladder,\r\nand refers to those of Sect. XXIX. of this work; which section was first\r\npublished in 1780; and to Macquire's Dictionary of Chemistry, Art. Urine.\r\n\r\nThe patient above described sometimes had a discharge of urine by the\r\nnavel, and at other times by the rectum, and sometimes by urinous sweats.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nORDO III.\r\n\r\n_Retrograde Irritative Motions._\r\n\r\nGENUS III.\r\n\r\n_Of the Sanguiferous System._\r\n\r\nSPECIES.\r\n\r\n1. _Capillarium motus retrogressus._ In microscopic experiments it is usual\r\nto see globules of blood regurgitate from the capillary vessels again and\r\nagain, before they pass through them; and not only the mouths of the veins,\r\nwhich arise from these capillaries, are frequently seen by microscopes to\r\nregurgitate some particles of blood during the struggles of the animal; but\r\na retrograde motion of the blood in the veins of these animals, from the\r\nvery heart to the extremities of the limbs, is observable by intervals\r\nduring the distresses of the dying creature.

See Section XXIX. 3. 8.\r\n\r\n2. _Palpitatio cordis._ May not the ineffectual and weak unequal motions of\r\nthe heart in hysteric cases be ascribed to the retrograde motions of it,\r\nwhich continue for a short time, or terminate in syncope? See Class IV. 3.\r\n1. 6.\r\n\r\n3. _Anhelatio spasmodica._ In some asthmas may not the difficulty of\r\nrespiration arise from the inverted action of the finer branches of the\r\nbronchia, or of the pulmonary artery or vein, like those of the capillaries\r\nabove described in No. 1. of this genus?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Orders and Genera of the Second Class of Diseases._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCLASS II.\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF SENSATION.\r\n\r\nORDO I.\r\n\r\n_Increased Sensation._\r\n\r\nGENERA.\r\n\r\n  1.

SENSATION.\r\n\r\nORDO I.\r\n\r\n_Increased Sensation._\r\n\r\nGENUS I.\r\n\r\n_With Increased Action of the Muscles._\r\n\r\nThe actions belonging to this genus are those which are immediately excited\r\nby the sensations of pain or pleasure, but which are neither followed by\r\ninflammation, nor by convulsion. The former of which belong to the\r\nsubsequent genera of this order, and the latter to the class of voluntary\r\nmotions.\r\n\r\nThe criterion between the actions, which are the immediate consequence of\r\npainful sensation, and convulsive actions properly so called, consists in\r\nthe former having a tendency to dislodge the stimulating cause, which\r\ninduces the painful sensation; and the latter being exerted for the purpose\r\nof expending the sensorial power, and thus dulling or destroying the\r\ngeneral sensation of the system. See Class III. 1.\r\n\r\nThere is a degree of heat produced in the affected part by these sensitive\r\nactions without inflammation, but in much less quantity than when attended\r\nby inflammation; as in the latter there is a production of new vessels. See\r\nSect. XXXIII. 2. 3.\r\n\r\nSome of the species of this genus cannot properly be termed diseases in\r\ntheir natural state, but become so by their defect or excess, and are here\r\ninserted to facilitate the explanation of the others.\r\n\r\nSPECIES.\r\n\r\n1. _Deglutitio._ Swallowing our food is immediately caused by the\r\npleasureable sensation occasioned by its stimulus on the palate or fauces\r\nand is acquired long before the nativity of the animal. Afterwards the pain\r\nof hunger previously produces the various voluntary exertions to procure\r\nthe proper material, but the actions of masticating and of swallowing it\r\nare effected by the sensorial power of sensation; which appears by their\r\nnot being always controulable by the will, as when children in vain attempt\r\nto swallow nauseous drugs. See Class IV. 1. 3. 1. The masticated food\r\nstimulates the palate, which is an organ of sense, into so much action, as\r\nto produce agreeable sensation; and the muscles subservient to deglutition\r\nare brought into action by the sensation thus produced. The pleasureable\r\nsensation is the proximate cause; the action of the fibres of the\r\nextremities of the nerves of taste is the remote cause; the sensorial power\r\nof irritation exciting these fibres of the nerves of taste into increased\r\naction is the pre-remote cause; the action of the muscles of deglutition is\r\nthe proximate effect; the pushing the food into the stomach is the remote\r\neffect; and the nutrition of the body is the post-remote effect.\r\n\r\nThough the muscles subservient to deglutition have their actions previously\r\nassociated, so as to be excited into synchronous tribes or successive\r\ntrains, either by volition, as when we swallow a disagreeable drug; or by\r\nsensation, as when we swallow agreeable food; or by irritation, as when we\r\ninattentively swallow our saliva; yet do all those three kinds of\r\ndeglutition belong to the respective classes of volition, sensation, and\r\nirritation; because the first links of these tribes or trains of muscular\r\naction are excited by those sensorial powers, and the associated links,\r\nwhich accompany or succeed them, are excited by the combined powers either\r\nof volition, or of sensation, or of irritation, along with that of\r\nassociation.\r\n\r\n2. _Respiratio._ Respiration is immediately caused by the sensorial power\r\nof sensation in consequence of the baneful want of vital air; and not from\r\nthe accumulation of blood in the lungs, as that might be carried on by\r\ninhaling azote alone, without the oxygenous part of the atmosphere. The\r\naction of respiration is thus similar to that of swallowing our food to\r\nappease the pain of hunger; but the lungs being surrounded with air, their\r\nproper pabulum, no intermediate voluntary exertions are required, as in\r\nhunger, to obtain and prepare the wanted material.\r\n\r\nRespiration is similar to slow combustion; the oxygenous part of the\r\natmosphere is received through the moist membranes, which line the\r\nair-cells of the lungs, and uniting with the inflammable part of the blood\r\ngenerates an acid, probably the phosphoric acid; a portion of carbonic acid\r\nis likewise produced in this process; as appears by repeatedly breathing\r\nover lime-water, which then becomes turbid. See Botanic Garden, P. I. Canto\r\nI. l. 401. note.\r\n\r\n3. _Sternutatio._ Sneezing consists of muscular actions produced by the\r\nsensorial faculty of sensation; and is an effort to dislodge, by means of\r\nair forcibly impelled through the nostrils, some material; which stimulates\r\nthe membrane, which lines them, into too great action, and might thence\r\ninjure the sense of smell which is diffused on it.\r\n\r\nIn this operation the too great action of the vessels of the membrane of\r\nthe nostrils is the remote cause; the sensation thence induced is the\r\nproximate cause; and the muscular actions are the proximate effect.\r\n\r\nThis action of sneezing frequently precedes common respiration in new-born\r\nchildren, but I believe not always; as like the latter it cannot have been\r\npreviously acquired in the uterus.\r\n\r\nIt is produced in some people by sudden light, as by looking up at the sky\r\nin a morning, when they come out of a gloomy bed-chamber. It then becomes\r\nan associate action, and belongs to Class IV. 1. 2. 2.\r\n\r\nM. M. When it is exerted to excess it may be cured by snuffing starch up\r\nthe nostrils. See Class I. 1. 2. 13.\r\n\r\n4. _Anhelitus._ Panting. The quick and laborious breathing of running\r\npeople, who are not accustomed to violent exercise, is occasioned by the\r\ntoo great conflux of blood to the lungs. As the sanguiferous system, as\r\nwell as the absorbent system, is furnished in many parts of its course with\r\nvalves, which in general prevent the retrograde movement of their contained\r\nfluids; and as all these vessels, in some part of their course, lie in\r\ncontact with the muscles, which are brought into action in running, it\r\nfollows that the blood must be accelerated by the intermitted swelling of\r\nthe bellies of the muscles moving over them.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of breathing, with which, very fat people are immediately\r\naffected on exercise, is owing to the pressure of the accumulated fat on\r\nthe veins, arteries, and lymphatics; and which, by distending the skin,\r\noccasions it to act as a tight bandage on the whole surface of the body.\r\nHence when the muscles are excited into quicker action, the progress of the\r\nblood in the veins, and of the lymph and chyle in the absorbent system, is\r\nurged on with much greater force, as under an artificial bandage on a limb,\r\nexplained in Art. IV. 2. 10. and in Sect. XXXIII. 3. 2. Hence the\r\ncirculation is instantly quickened to a great degree, and the difficulty of\r\nbreathing is the consequence of a more rapid circulation through the lungs.\r\nThe increased secretion of the perspirable matter is another consequence of\r\nthis rapid circulation; fat people, when at rest, are believed to perspire\r\nless than others, which may be gathered from their generally having more\r\nliquid stools, more and paler urine, and to their frequently taking less\r\nfood than many thin people; and lastly, from the perspiration of fat people\r\nbeing generally more inodorous than that of lean ones; but when corpulent\r\npeople are put in motion, the sweat stands in drops on their skins, and\r\nthey \"lard the ground\" as they run. The increase of heat of corpulent\r\npeople on exercise, is another consequence of their more rapid circulation,\r\nand greater secretion. See Class I. 2. 3. 17.\r\n\r\nOther causes of difficult or quick respiration will be treated of under\r\nAsthma, Pertussis, Peripneumony, Tonsillitis.\r\n\r\n5. _Tussis ebriorum._ Sensitive cough is an exertion of the muscles used in\r\nexpiration excited into more violent action by the sensorial power of\r\nsensation, in consequence of something which too powerfully stimulates the\r\nlungs. As the saline part of the secreted mucus, when the absorption of it\r\nis impeded; or the too great viscidity of it, when the absorption is\r\nincreased; or the too great quantity of the mucus, when the secretion is\r\nincreased; or the inflammation of the membranes of the lungs; it is an\r\neffort to dislodge any of these extraneous materials.\r\n\r\nOf this kind is the cough which attends free-drinkers after a debauch; it\r\nconsists of many short efforts to cough, with a frequent expuition of half\r\na tea-spoonful of frothy mucus, and is attended with considerable thirst.\r\nThe thirst is occasioned by the previous dissipation of the aqueous parts\r\nof the blood by sensible or insensible perspiration; which was produced by\r\nthe increased action of the cutaneous and pulmonary capillaries during the\r\nstimulus of the wine. In consequence of this an increased absorption\r\ncommences to replace this moisture, and the skin and mouth become dry, and\r\nthe pulmonary mucus becomes inspissated; which stimulates the bronchia, and\r\nis raised into froth by the successive currents of air in evacuating it.\r\nThis production of froth is called by some free-drinkers \"spitting\r\nsixpences\" after a debauch. This subsequent thirst, dry mouth, and viscid\r\nexpectoration in some people succeeds the slightest degree of intoxication,\r\nof which it may be esteemed a criterion. See Class IV. 2. 1. 8.\r\n\r\nAs coughs are not always attended with pain, the muscular actions, which\r\nproduce them, are sometimes excited by the sensorial faculty of irritation,\r\nas in Class I. 1. 2. 8. I. 1. 3. 4. I. 1. 4. 3. I. 2. 3. 4. Coughs are also\r\nsometimes convulsive, as in Class III. 1. 1. 10. and sometimes sympathetic,\r\nas Class IV. 2. 1. 7.\r\n\r\nM. M. Venesection, when the cough is attended with inflammation. Mucilages.\r\nOpium. Torpentia. Blister.\r\n\r\n6. _Singultus._ Hiccough is an exertion of the muscles used in inspiration\r\nexcited into more violent action by the sensorial power of sensation, in\r\nconsequence of something which too powerfully stimulates the cardia\r\nventriculi, or upper orifice of the stomach. As when solid food is too\r\nhastily taken without sufficient dilution. And is an effort to dislodge\r\nthat offensive material, and push it to some less sensible part of the\r\nstomach, or into the middle of the contained aliment.\r\n\r\nAt the end of fatal fevers it may arise from the acrimony of the undigested\r\naliment, or from a part of the stomach being already dead, and by its\r\nweight or coldness affecting the surviving part with disagreeable\r\nsensation. The pain about the upper orifice of the stomach is the proximate\r\ncause, the too great or too little action of the fibres of this part of the\r\nstomach is the remote cause, the action of the muscles used in inspiration\r\nis the proximate effect, and the repercussion of the offending material is\r\nthe remote effect.\r\n\r\nHiccough is sometimes sympathetic, occasioned by the pain of gravel in the\r\nkidney or ureter, as in Class IV. 1. 1. 7. and is sometimes a symptom of\r\nepilepsy or reverie, as in Sect. XIX. 2.\r\n\r\nM. M. Oil of cinnamon from one drop gradually increased to ten, on sugar,\r\nor on chalk. Opium. Blister. Emetic.\r\n\r\n7. _Asthma humorale._ The humoral asthma probably consists in a temporary\r\nanasarca of the lungs, which may be owing to a temporary defect of\r\nlymphatic absorption. Its cause is nevertheless at present very obscure,\r\nsince a temporary deficiency of venous absorption, at the extremities of\r\nthe pulmonary or bronchial veins, might occasion a similar difficulty of\r\nrespiration. See Abortio, Class I. 2. 1. 14. Or it might be supposed, that\r\nthe lymph effused into the cavity of the chest might, by some additional\r\nheat during sleep, acquire an aerial form, and thus compress the lungs; and\r\non this circumstance the relief, which these patients receive from cold\r\nair, would be readily accounted for.\r\n\r\nThe paroxysms attack the patient in his first sleep, when the circulation\r\nthrough the lungs in weak people wants the assistance of the voluntary\r\npower. Class I. 2. 1. 3. And hence the absorbents of the lungs are less\r\nable to fulfil the whole of their duty. And part of the thin mucus, which\r\nis secreted into the air-cells, remains there unabsorbed, and occasions the\r\ndifficult respiration, which awakes the patient. And the violent exertions\r\nof the muscles of respiration, which succeed, are excited by the pain of\r\nsuffocation, for the purpose of pushing forwards the blood through the\r\ncompressed capillaries, and to promote the absorption of the effused lymph.\r\n\r\nIn this the humoral differs from the convulsive asthma, treated of in Class\r\nIII. 1. 1. 10. as in that there is probably no accumulated fluid to be\r\nabsorbed; and the violent respiration is only an exertion for the purpose\r\nof relieving pain, either in the lungs or in some distant part, as in other\r\nconvulsions, or epilepsy; and in this respect the fits of humoral and\r\nconvulsive asthma essentially differ from each other, contrary to the\r\nopinion expressed without sufficient consideration in Sect. XVIII. 15.\r\n\r\nThe patients in the paroxysms both of humoral and convulsive asthma find\r\nrelief from cold air, as they generally rise out of bed, and open the\r\nwindow, and put out their heads; for the lungs are not sensible to cold,\r\nand the sense of suffocation is somewhat relieved by there being more\r\noxygen contained in a given quantity of cold fresh air, than in the warm\r\nconfined air of a close bed-chamber.\r\n\r\nI have seen humoral asthma terminate in confirmed anasarca, and destroy the\r\npatient, who had been an excessive drinker of spirituous potation. And M.\r\nSavage asserts, that this disease frequently terminates in diabetes; which\r\nseems to shew, that it is a temporary dropsy relieved by a great flow of\r\nurine. Add to this, that these paroxysms of the asthma are themselves\r\nrelieved by profuse sweats of the upper parts of the body, as explained in\r\nClass I. 3. 2. 8. which would countenance the idea of their being\r\noccasioned by congestions of lymph in the lungs.\r\n\r\nThe congestion of lymph in the lungs from the defective absorption of it is\r\nprobably the remote cause of humoral asthma; but the pain of suffocation is\r\nthe immediate cause of the violent exertions in the paroxysms. And whether\r\nthis congestion of lymph in the air-cells of the lungs increases during our\r\nsleep, as above suggested, or not; the pain of suffocation will be more and\r\nmore distressing after some hours of sleep, as the sensibility to internal\r\nstimuli increases during that time, as described in Sect. XVIII. 15. For\r\nthe same reason many epileptic fits, and paroxysms of the gout, occur\r\nduring sleep.\r\n\r\nIn two gouty cases, complicated with jaundice, and pain, and sickness, the\r\npatients had each of them a shivering fit, like the commencement of an\r\nague, to the great alarm of their friends; both which commenced in the\r\nnight, I suppose during their sleep; and the consequence was a cessation of\r\nthe jaundice, and pain about the stomach, and sickness; and instead of that\r\nthe gout appeared in their extremities. In these cases I conjecture, that\r\nthere was a metastasis not only of the diseased action from the membranes\r\nof the liver to those of the foot; but that some of the new vessels, or new\r\nfluids, which were previously produced in the inflamed liver, were\r\ntranslated to the feet during the cold fit, by the increased absorption of\r\nthe hepatic lymphatics, and by the retrograde motions of those of the\r\naffected limbs.\r\n\r\nThis I think resembles in some respects a fit of humoral asthma, where\r\nstronger motions of the absorbent vessels of the lungs are excited, and\r\nretrograde ones of the correspondent cutaneous lymphatics; whence the\r\nviolent sweats of the upper parts of the body only are produced; and for a\r\ntime the patient becomes relieved by the metastasis and elimination of the\r\noffending material by sensitive exertion. For a further account of this\r\nintricate subject see Class III. 1. 1. 10.\r\n\r\nM. M. To relieve the paroxysm a tea-spoonful of ether may be given mixed\r\nwith water, with 10 drops of laudanum, to be repeated three or four times.\r\nVenesection. An emetic. A blister. Afterwards the Peruvian bark, with a\r\ngrain of opium at night, and two or three of aloes. A flannel shirt in\r\nwinter, but not in summer. Issues. Digitalis?\r\n\r\nIn this species of asthma, there is great reason to believe, that the\r\nrespiration of an atmosphere, with an increased proportion of oxygen, will\r\nprove of great advantage; some well-observed and well-attested cases of\r\nwhich are published by Dr. Beddoes; as this purer air invigorates the\r\ncirculation, and the whole system in consequence, perhaps not only by its\r\nstimulus, but by its supplying the material from which the sensorial power\r\nis extracted or fabricated. In spasmodic asthma, on the contrary, Dr.\r\nFerriar has found undoubted benefit from an atmosphere mixed with hydrogen.\r\nSee Sect. XVIII. 15. and Class III. 1. 1. 10.\r\n\r\n8. _Nictitatio sensitiva._ Winking of the eyes is performed every minute,\r\nwithout our attention, for the purpose of diffusing the tears over them,\r\nwhich are poured into the eye a little above the external corner of it, and\r\nwhich are afterwards absorbed by the lacrymal points above and below the\r\ninternal corner of it. When this operation is performed without our\r\nattention, it is caused by the faculty of irritation, and belongs to Class\r\nI. 1. 4. 1. but when it is produced by a stronger stimulus of any\r\nextraneous material in the eye, so as to cause pain, the violent and\r\nfrequent nictitation is caused by the faculty of sensation.\r\n\r\nThis disease is sometimes produced by the introversion of the edge of the\r\nlower eyelid, which bends the points of the hairs of the eyelash upon the\r\nball of the eye, which perpetually stimulate it into painful sensation.\r\nThis introversion of the eyelid is generally owing to a tumor of the\r\ncellular membrane below the edge of the eyelid, and though a very\r\ntroublesome complaint may often be cured by the following simple means. A\r\nlittle common plaster spread on thin linen, about a quarter of an inch\r\nlong, must be rolled up so as to be about the size of a crow-quill, this\r\nmust be applied immediately below the eyelash on the outside of the eye;\r\nand must be kept on by another plaster over it. This will then act as a\r\nslight compression on the tumor under the eyelash, and will prevent the\r\nhairs from touching the eye-ball. In a week or two the compression will\r\ndiminish the tumor it lies over, and cure this painful deformity.\r\n\r\n9. _Oscitatio et pandiculatio._ Yawning and stretching of the limbs is\r\nproduced either by a long inactivity of the muscles now brought into\r\naction, as sometimes happens after sleep, or after listening a long time to\r\na dull narrative; or it is produced by a too long continued action of the\r\nantagonist muscles. In the former case there is an accumulation of\r\nsensorial power during the quiescence of the muscles now brought into\r\naction; which probably constitutes the pain or wearisomeness of a continued\r\nattitude. In the latter case there is an exhaustion of sensorial power in\r\nthe muscles, which have lately been acting violently, and a consequent\r\naccumulation in the muscles, which are antagonists to them, and which were\r\nat rest.\r\n\r\nThese involuntary motions are often seen in paralytic limbs, which are at\r\nthe same time completely disobedient to the will; and are frequently\r\nobservable in very young children; and from thence we may conclude, that\r\nthese motions are learnt before nativity; as puppies are seen to open their\r\nmouths before the membranes are broken. See Sect. XVI. 2.\r\n\r\nWhere these motions are observed in limbs otherwise paralytic, it is an\r\nindication that electric shocks may be employed with advantage, as the\r\nexcitability of the limb by irritation is not extinct, though it be\r\ndisobedient both to volition and sensation.\r\n\r\n10. _Tenesmus_ consists in violent and frequent ineffectual efforts to\r\ndischarge the contents of the rectum, owing to pain of the sphincter. The\r\npain is produced by indurated feces, or by some acrid material, as the\r\nacidity of indigested aliment; and the efforts are attended with mucus from\r\nthe pained membrane. The feces must sometimes be taken away by the end of a\r\nmarrow-spoon, as cathartics and even clyster will pass without removing\r\nthem. It is sometimes caused by sympathy with the urethra, when there is a\r\nstone at the neck of the bladder. See Class II. 2. 2. 7. and IV. 1. 2. 8.\r\n\r\nM. M. Fomentation, an enema with mucilage and laudanum.\r\n\r\nThe common exclusion of the feces from the rectum is a process similar to\r\nthis, except that the muscles of the sphincter ani, and those of the\r\nabdomen, which act along with them by the combined powers of sensation and\r\nassociation, are in tenesmus excited by painful sensation, and in the\r\nlatter by a sensation, which may in some instances be almost called\r\npleasurable, as relieving us from a painful one in the exclusion of the\r\nfeces.\r\n\r\n11. _Stranguria._ Strangury consists in painful efforts to discharge the\r\ncontents of the urinary bladder. It is generally owing to a stone in the\r\nsphincter of the bladder; or to the inflammation of the neck of it\r\noccasioned by cantharides. It is sometimes caused by sympathy with the\r\npiles; and then is liable in women to occasion convulsions, from the\r\nviolence of the pain without inflammation. See Class IV. 2. 2. 2. and 3.\r\n\r\nM. M. Fomentation clyster with oil and laudanum, push the stone back with a\r\nbougie; if from cantharides give half a pint of warm water every ten\r\nminutes. Mucilage of gum arabic and tragacanth.\r\n\r\nThe natural evacuation of the urine is a process similar to this, except\r\nthat the muscular fibres of the bladder, and the muscles of the abdomen,\r\nwhich act in concert with them by the combined powers of sensation and of\r\nassociation, are, in the former case of strangury, excited into action by\r\npainful sensation; and in the latter by a sensation, which may almost be\r\ntermed pleasurable, as it relieves us from a previous uneasy one.\r\n\r\nThe ejectio feminis is another process in some respects similar to\r\nstrangury, as belonging to the same sensible canal of the urethra, and by\r\nexciting into action the accelerator muscles; but in the strangury these\r\nmuscles are excited into action by painful sensation, and in the ejection\r\nof the semen by pleasureable sensation.\r\n\r\n12. _Parturitio._ Parturition is not a disease, it is a natural process,\r\nbut is more frequently unfortunate in high life than amongst the middle\r\nclass of females; which may be owing partly to fear, with which the priests\r\nof LUCINA are liable to inspire the ladies of fashion to induce them to lie\r\nin in town; and partly to the bad air of London, to which they purposely\r\nresort.\r\n\r\nThere are however other causes, which render parturition more dangerous to\r\nthe ladies of high life; such as their greater general debility from\r\nneglect of energetic exercise, their inexperience of the variations of cold\r\nand heat, and their seclusion from fresh air. To which must be added, that\r\ngreat source of the destruction of female grace and beauty, as well as of\r\nfemale health, the tight stays, and other bandages, with which they are\r\ngenerally tortured in their early years by the active folly of their\r\nfriends, which by displacing many of the viscera impedes their actions, and\r\nby compressing them together produces adhesions of one part to another, and\r\naffects even the form and aperture of the bones of the pelvis, through\r\nwhich the nascent child must be protruded.\r\n\r\nAs parturition is a natural, not a morbid process, no medicine should be\r\ngiven, where there is no appearance of disease. The absurd custom of giving\r\na powerful opiate without indication to all women, as soon as they are\r\ndelivered, is, I make no doubt, frequently attended with injurious, and\r\nsometimes with fatal consequences. See Class II. 1. 2. 16.\r\n\r\nAnother thing very injurious to the child, is the tying and cutting the\r\nnavel-string too soon; which should always be left till the child has not\r\nonly repeatedly breathed, but till all pulsation in the cord ceases. As\r\notherwise the child is much weaker than it ought to be; a part of the blood\r\nbeing left in the placenta, which ought to have been in the child; and at\r\nthe same time the placenta does not so naturally collapse, and withdraw\r\nitself from the sides of the uterus, and is not therefore removed with so\r\nmuch safety and certainty. The folly of giving rue or rhubarb to new-born\r\nchildren, and the danger of feeding them with gruel instead of milk, is\r\nspoken of in Class I. 1. 2. 5. and II. 1. 2. 16.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nORDO I.\r\n\r\n_Increased Sensation._\r\n\r\nGENUS II.\r\n\r\n_With the Production of new Vessels by internal Membranes or Glands, with\r\nFever._\r\n\r\nIn the first class of diseases two kinds of fevers were described, one from\r\nexcess, and the other from defect of irritation; and were in consequence\r\ntermed irritative, and inirritative fevers. In this second class of\r\ndiseases another kind of fever occurs, which is caused by excess of\r\nsensation, and termed in consequence Sensitive Fever. But there is no fever\r\nfrom defect of sensation, because the circulation is carried on in health\r\nwithout our consciousness, that is, without any sensation attending it.\r\n\r\nBut as excess of sensation may exist with excess or defect of irritation,\r\ntwo other kinds of fever arise from a combination of sensitive fever with\r\nthe irritative, and inirritative ones. Making five kinds in all.\r\n\r\n1. Irritative fever, described in Class I. 1. 1. 1.\r\n\r\n2. Inirritative fever. Class I. 2. 1. 1.\r\n\r\n3. Sensitive fever. Class II. 1. 6. 1.\r\n\r\n4. Sensitive irritated fever. Class II. 1. 2. 1.\r\n\r\n5. Sensitive inirritated fever. Class II. 1. 3. 1.\r\n\r\nAs the sensitive irritated fever attends all the diseases enumerated under\r\nthe genus about to be described, it is placed at the head of it. And as the\r\nsensitive inirritated fever accompanies the greatest number of the species\r\nenumerated under the third genus of this order, it is placed at the head of\r\nthem. And as the sensitive fever attends the diseases of the sixth genus,\r\nit is placed at the head of them. But as every febrile paroxysm consists of\r\ndisordered tribes or trains of associated motions, it may be doubted,\r\nwhether they ought not all to have been placed in the fourth class, amongst\r\nthe diseases of association. See Class IV. 2. 4. 11.\r\n\r\nAll the subsequent species of this genus are attended with sensitive\r\nirritated fever; there are nevertheless some superficial inflammations,\r\nwhich affect the same situations without much fever, as the scrophulous\r\nophthalmy and spurious peripneumony, which belong to other genera.\r\n\r\nInflammation is uniformly attended with the production or secretion of new\r\nfibres constituting new vessels; this therefore may be esteemed its\r\nessential character, or the criterion of its existence. The extension of\r\nthe old vessels seems rather a consequence than a cause of the germination,\r\nor pullulation, of these new ones; for the old vessels may be enlarged, and\r\nexcited with unusual energy, without any production of new ones, as in the\r\nblush of shame or of anger.\r\n\r\nWhen these new vessels are formed, if they are not reabsorbed into the\r\ncirculation, they secrete a new fluid called purulent matter; which\r\ngenerally opens itself a passage on the external skin, and produces an\r\nulcer, which either gradually heals, or spreads, and is the cause of hectic\r\nfever; or they secrete contagious matter, which has the property of\r\nexciting the same kind of inflammation, and of producing the same kind of\r\ncontagious matter, when inserted by inoculation into the skin of other\r\npersons. These contagious matters form ulcers, which either heal\r\nspontaneously, or by art; or continue to spread, and destroy the patient,\r\nby other kinds of hectic fever.\r\n\r\nIn this genus there is an increase of the sensorial power of irritation as\r\nwell as of sensation; whence great arterial energy is produced, and the\r\npulse becomes strong and full, as well as quick; and the coats of the\r\narteries feel hard under the finger, being themselves thickened and\r\ndistended by inflammation. The blood drawn, especially at the second\r\nbleeding, is covered with a tough size; which is probably the mucus from\r\nthe inflamed internal surface of the arteries, increased in quantity, and\r\nmore coagulable than in its natural state; the thinner part being more\r\nperfectly absorbed by the increased action of the inflamed absorbents. See\r\nSect. XXXIII. 2. 2. This is rendered more probable, because the hard feel\r\nof the pulse, and the abundance of coagulable lymph commence, exist, and\r\ncease together.\r\n\r\nGreat heat is produced from the new chemical combinations arising in the\r\nsecretion of new fibres, and great pain from the distention of old ones, or\r\nfrom their increased action. The increased quantity of sensation from a\r\ntopical inflammation or phlegmon is the immediate cause of the febris\r\nsensitiva irritata, or inflammatory fever; as when it arises from the pain\r\nof pleurisy, or paronychia; but generally an irritative fever precedes this\r\ntopical inflammation, which occurs during the hot fit of it; and then the\r\nirritative fever is changed into a sensitive irritated fever, by the\r\nadditional cause of the sensorial power of sensation besides that of\r\nirritation.\r\n\r\nSPECIES.\r\n\r\n1. _Febris sensitiva irritata._ Sensitive irritated fever, or inflammatory\r\nfever. Phlegmasia. A strong full pulse, with inflammation of the coats of\r\nthe arteries, constitutes this disease. It originates from some topical\r\ninflammation, which, if the fever is not subdued, terminates in\r\nsuppuration; and differs from irritative fever in respect to the painful\r\nsensation which accompanies it. For as pleasurable sensation is the cause\r\nof the growth of the new vessels, and distention of the old ones, in the\r\nnatural enlargement of the body during our infancy; so a painful sensation\r\nis the cause of the unnatural production of new vessels, and enlargement of\r\nold ones in inflammatory diseases.\r\n\r\nWhen matter is thus formed in any internal viscus, or in the cellular\r\nmembrane, as in the lungs or liver; so long as this abscess remains without\r\nadmission of air, this inflammatory fever is liable to continue, receiving\r\nonly temporary relief by bleeding or emetics, or cathartics; till the\r\npatient, after a month, or two, or three, expires. But, if air be admitted\r\nto these internal abscesses, this kind of fever is changed into a hectic\r\nfever in a single day. It also sometimes happens, that when the abscess\r\nremains unopened to the air, if the matter has become putrid, that hectic\r\nfever supervenes, with colliquative sweats, or diarrhoea; the matter in\r\nboth cases is sometimes absorbed, and the sides of the abscess grow\r\ntogether again without an external aperture. See Class II. 1. 4. 1. and 2.\r\nAnother termination of inflammation is in gangrene, but this belongs to the\r\ninflammation of the external skin; as the production of purulent matter\r\nbelongs to inflammation of the internal or mucous membranes. Thus when the\r\nexternal skin is the seat of inflammation, as in erythema, or erysipelas,\r\nand produces sensitive irritated fever, no collection of purulent matter\r\ncan be formed; but a material oozes out, and lies upon the surface, like\r\nthat in the confluent small-pox, and the cuticle at length peels off, or\r\ngangrene supervenes. It must be noted, that these kinds of inflammation can\r\nexist together; and some parts of the cellular membrane may suppurate at\r\nthe same time that the external skin is affected with erythema, or\r\nerysipelas.\r\n\r\nM. M. Venesection. Cathartics. Diluents. Cool air. Torpentia. Cold Bath?\r\nSee Sect. XII. 6.\r\n\r\nThe increased arterial action in this sensitive irritated fever is not\r\nsimply owing to the increased irritability of the arterial system, or to\r\nthe stimulus of the distention of the vessels, but also to the increased\r\nacrimony or pungency of the blood; which has now so far changed its nature\r\nas to become more fluid, more dense, and to be loaded with coagulable\r\nlymph. Hence it becomes necessary not only to lessen the quantity of blood\r\nby venesection and by cathartics, but also to dilute its acrimony, or\r\npungency, by the introduction of aqueous and mucilaginous fluids, such as\r\nbarley water, cream and water, sugar and water, weak broths; to which may\r\nbe added so much of some vegetable essential oil, as may render them\r\ngrateful to the stomach, and thus promote their absorption, as by infusing\r\nparsley or cellery and turneps in the broth; or by balm, mint, or sage\r\nteas.\r\n\r\nThe following species of this genus only distinguish the situation of the\r\npart previously inflamed, and which is the remote cause of the sensitive\r\nirritated, or inflammatory fever, which attends it.\r\n\r\n2. _Ophthalmia interna._ Inflammation of the eye is attended with the\r\nproduction of new vessels, which spread over the tunica adjunctiva, and\r\nover the cornea; these new vessels are easily seen, as they lie on a white\r\nground, and give ocular demonstration of their production in inflammation.\r\nWhen this inflammation of the cornea suppurates, it is liable to leave\r\nlittle ulcers, which may be seen beneath the surface in the form of little\r\nexcavations; and as these heal, they are liable to be covered with an opake\r\nscar. This scar, in some months or years, is liable to wear away, and\r\nbecome transparent, without the assistance of any polishing powder, as of\r\nvery finely levigated glass, as some have recommended. But when the cornea\r\nis affected through all its thickness, the return of its transparency\r\nbecomes hopeless. See Class I. 1. 3. 14.\r\n\r\nIn violent degrees of ophthalmy the internal parts, as the retina, optic\r\nartery, iris, ciliary process, become inflamed, as well as the external\r\nones; hence the least light admitted to the eye occasions intolerable pain.\r\nThis curious circumstance cannot be owing to the action of light on the\r\ninflamed vessels of the cornea; it therefore shews, that the extremity of\r\nthe optic nerve or retina is also rendered more exquisitely sensible to\r\nlight, by partaking of the inflammation; and I have been told, that red\r\ncolours are in these cases sometimes painfully perceived even in perfect\r\ndarkness. This shews that the retina is excited into motion by the stimulus\r\nof light; and that, when it is inflamed, these motions give great pain,\r\nlike those of other inflamed parts, as the muscles, or membranes. And\r\nsecondly, that the ideas of colours consist in the motions of the retina;\r\nwhich ideas occasion pain, when the extremity of the moving nerve is\r\ninflamed.\r\n\r\nM. M. Venesection. Cathartics. Diluents. Torpentia. Frequently moisten the\r\neye with cold water by means of a rag. Cool airy room. Darkness. When the\r\ninflammation begins to decline, white vitriol gr. vi. in an ounce of water\r\nis more efficacious to moisten the eye than solutions of lead. Tincture of\r\nopium diluted. New vessels from the inflamed tunica adnata frequently\r\nspread like a fly's wing upon the transparent cornea, which is then called\r\nPterigium. To stop the growth of this, the principal vessels should be cut\r\nthrough with a lancet. When the inflammation begins to decline, after due\r\nevacuation any stimulating material put into the eye increases the\r\nabsorption, which soon removes the new red vessels; which has given rise to\r\na hundred famous eye-waters, and eye-doctors; if these stimulating\r\nmaterials are used too soon, the inflammation is increased by them. See\r\nSect. XXXII. 2. 10.\r\n\r\nThere is another ophthalmia, which attends weak children, and is generally\r\nesteemed a symptom of scrophula, as described in Class II. 1. 4. 1. and\r\nanother, which is of venereal origin, mentioned in Class II. 1. 5. 2. both\r\nwhich may be termed ophthalmia superficialis.\r\n\r\n3. _Phrenitis._ Inflammation of the brain is attended with intolerance of\r\nlight and sound; which shews, that the extremities of the nerves of those\r\nsenses are at the same time inflamed; it is also attended with great pain\r\nof the head, with watchfulness, and furious delirium. The violent efforts,\r\nthese patients are said sometimes to exert, are owing to the increased\r\nsecretion of sensorial power in the brain; as all other inflamed glands\r\nhave a greater circulation of blood passing through them, and a greater\r\nsecretion in consequence of their peculiar fluids, as in the hepatitis much\r\nmore bile is generated.\r\n\r\nM. M. Venesection. Cathartics. Torpentia. Foment the head with cold water\r\nfor hours together. Or with warm water. Cool airy room. Afterwards cupping\r\non the occiput. Leeches to the temples. When the patient is weakened a\r\nblister on the head, and after further exhaustion five or six drops of\r\ntincture of opium.\r\n\r\n4. _Peripneumonia._ Inflammation of the lungs. The pulse is not always\r\nhard, sometimes soft; which is probably owing to a degree of sickness or\r\ninaction of the stomach; with dull pain of the chest; respiration\r\nconstantly difficult, sometimes with erect posture; the face bloated and\r\npurplish; cough generally with moist expectoration, often stained with\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nWhen the difficulty of respiration is very great, the patient is not able\r\nto cough; in this situation, after copious bleeding, the cough is liable to\r\nreturn, and is so far a favourable symptom, as it shews some abatement of\r\nthe inflammation.\r\n\r\nA peripneumony frequently occurs in the chin-cough, and destroys the\r\npatient, except immediate recourse be had to the lancet, or to four or five\r\nleeches; when blood cannot be otherwise taken.\r\n\r\nThe peripneumony is very fatal to young children, especially as I believe\r\nit is frequently mistaken for a spasmodic asthma, or for the croup, or\r\ncynanche trachealis of Cullen. Both which, however, when they occur,\r\nrequire immediate venesection by the lancet or by leeches, as well as the\r\nperipneumony.\r\n\r\nThe croup is an inflammation of the upper part, and the peripneumony of the\r\nlower part of the same organ, viz. the trachea or windpipe. See Class I. 1.\r\n3. 4. But as the inflammation is seldom I suppose confined to the upper\r\npart of the trachea only, but exists at the same time in other parts of the\r\nlungs, and as no inflammation of the tonsils is generally perceptible, the\r\nuncouth name of cynanche trachealis should be changed for _peripneumonia\r\ntrachialis_. The method of cure consists in immediate and repeated\r\nbleeding. A vomit. A grain of calomel or other mild cathartic. Bathing in\r\nsubtepid water, and in breathing over the steam of warm water, with or\r\nwithout a little vinegar in it. And lastly, by keeping the child raised\r\nhigh in bed.\r\n\r\nInflammation of the lungs is also liable to occur in the measles, and must\r\nbe attacked by venesection at any time of the disease; otherwise either a\r\npresent death, or an incurable consumption, is the consequence.\r\n\r\nThe peripneumony is frequently combined with inflammation of the pleura,\r\nand sometimes with that of the diaphragm; either of these may generally be\r\ndistinguished, not only by the pain which attends inflammation of these\r\nmembranes, but by inspecting the naked chest, and observing whether the\r\npatient breathes more by elevating the ribs, or by depressing the\r\ndiaphragm.\r\n\r\nA crisis happens in children about the sixth day with much pale urine,\r\nwhich must be waited for after evacuations have been used, as far as can be\r\ndone with safety; in this situation the warm bath twice a day, and small\r\nblisters repeatedly in succession, are of peculiar service.\r\n\r\nAfter the termination of peripneumony a collection of coagulable lymph is\r\nfrequently left in the cavity of the chest unabsorbed; or a common anasarca\r\nof the lungs occurs from the present inaction of the absorbent vessels,\r\nwhich had previously been excited too violently. This difficulty of\r\nbreathing is cured or relieved by the exhibition of digitalis. See Art. IV.\r\n2. 8.\r\n\r\nM. M. The lancet is the anchor of hope in this disease; which must be\r\nrepeated four or five times, or as often as the fever and difficulty of\r\nbreathing increase, which is generally in the evening; antimonials,\r\ndiluents, repeated small blisters about the chest, mucilage, pediluvium,\r\nwarm bath. Is a decoction of seneka-root of use? Do not neutral salts\r\nincrease the tendency to cough by their stimulus, as they increase the heat\r\nof urine in gonorrhoea? Children in every kind of difficult breathing, from\r\nwhatever cause, should be kept as upright in bed as may be, and continually\r\nwatched; since, if they slip down, they are liable to be immediately\r\nsuffocated. After the patient is greatly debilitated, so that no further\r\nevacuation can be admitted, and the difficult breathing and cough continue,\r\nI have given four or five drops of tincture of opium, that is, about a\r\nquarter of a grain of solid opium, with great advantage, and I believe in\r\nseveral cases I have saved the patient. A greater quantity of opium in this\r\nstate of debility cannot be used without hazarding the life of the person.\r\nThis small quantity of an opiate should be given about six in the evening,\r\nor before the access of the evening paroxysm, and repeated three or four\r\nnights, or longer.\r\n\r\nThere is a peripneumony with weak pulse, which may be termed _peripneumonia\r\ninirritata_, as described in Sect. XXVII. 2. which belongs to this place.\r\nSee also Superficial Peripneumony, Class II. 1. 3. 7.\r\n\r\n5. _Pleuritis._ Pleurisy. Inflammation of the pleura, with hard pulse, pain\r\nchiefly of the side, pungent, particularly increased during inspiration;\r\nlying on either side uneasy, the cough very painful, dry at the beginning,\r\nafterwards moist, often bloody.\r\n\r\nOne cause of pleurisy is probably a previous adhesion of the lungs to a\r\npart of the pleura, which envelops them. This in many cases has been\r\nproduced in infancy, by suffering children to lie too long on one side. Or\r\nby placing them uniformly on one side of a fire, or window, to which they\r\nwill be liable always to bend themselves.\r\n\r\nWhen matter is produced during peripneumony or pleurisy in one side of the\r\nchest, so long as it is a concealed vomica, the fever continues, if the\r\ndisease be great, for many weeks, and even months; and requires occasional\r\nvenesection, till the patient sinks under the inflammatory or sensitive\r\nirritated fever. But if air be admitted, by a part of the abscess opening\r\nitself a way into the air-vessels of the lungs, a hectic fever, with\r\ncolliquitive sweats or diarrhoea, supervenes, and frequently destroys the\r\npatient; or the abscess heals the lungs adhering to the pleura.\r\n\r\nM. M. The lancet must be used copiously, and repeated as often as the pain\r\nand difficult respiration increase. A blister on the pained part.\r\nAntimonial preparations. Diluents. Cool air. Do neutral salts increase the\r\ntendency to cough? Pediluvium or semicupium frequently repeated.\r\n\r\n6. _Diaphragmitis._ Inflammation of the diaphragm. Pain round the lower\r\nribs as if girt with a cord. Difficult respiration performed only by\r\nelevating the ribs and in an erect posture. The corners of the mouth\r\nfrequently retracted into a disagreeable smile, called risus Sardonicus.\r\n\r\nThose animals, which are furnished with clavicles, or collar-bones, not\r\nonly use their foremost feet as hands, as men, monkies, cats, mice,\r\nsquirrels, &c. but elevate their ribs in respiration as well as depress the\r\ndiaphragm for the purpose of enlarging the cavity of the chest. Hence an\r\ninflammation of the diaphragm is sudden death to those animals, as horses\r\nand dogs, which can only breaths by depressing the diaphragm; and is I\r\nsuppose the cause of the sudden death of horses that are over-worked;\r\nwhereas, in the human animal, when the diaphragm is inflamed, so as to\r\nrender its motions impossible from the pain they occasion, respiration can\r\nbe carried on, though in a less perfect manner, by the intercostal muscles\r\nin the elevation of the ribs. In pleurisy the ribs are kept motionless, and\r\nthe respiration is performed by the diaphragm, as may be readily seen on\r\ninspecting the naked chest, and which is generally a bad symptom; in the\r\ndiaphragmitis the ribs are alternately elevated, and depressed, but the\r\nlower part of the belly is not seen to move.\r\n\r\nM. M. As in pleurisy and peripneumony. When the patient becomes delirious,\r\nand smiles disagreeably by intervals, and is become so weak, that\r\nevacuations by the lancet could be used no further, and I have almost\r\ndespaired of my patient, I have found in two or three instances, that about\r\nfive or six drops of tinct. thebaic, given an hour before the evening\r\nexacerbation, has had the happiest effect, and cured the patient in this\r\ncase, as well as in common peripneumony; it must be repeated two or three\r\nevenings, see Class II. 1. 2. 4. as the exacerbation of the fever and\r\ndifficult respiration and delirium generally increase towards night.\r\n\r\nThe stimulus of this small quantity of opium on a patient previously so\r\nmuch debilitated, acts by increasing the exertion of the absorbent vessels,\r\nin the same manner as a solution of opium, or any other stimulant, put on\r\nan inflamed eye after the vessels are previously emptied by evacuations,\r\nstimulates the absorbent system, so as to cause the remaining new vessels\r\nto be immediately reabsorbed. Which same stimulants would have increased\r\nthe inflammation, if they had been applied before the evacuations. See\r\nClass II. 1. 2. 2. Sect. XXXIII. 3. 1. When the sanguiferous system is full\r\nof blood, the absorbents cannot act so powerfully, as the progress of their\r\ncontents is opposed by the previous fulness of the blood-vessels; whence\r\nstimulants in that case increase the action of the secerning system more\r\nthan of the absorbent one; but after copious evacuation this resistance to\r\nthe progress of the absorbed fluids is removed; and when stimulants are\r\nthen applied, they increase the action of the absorbent system more than\r\nthat of the secerning one. Hence opium given in the commencement of\r\ninflammatory diseases destroys the patient; and cures them, if given in\r\nvery small doses at the end of inflammatory diseases.\r\n\r\n7. _Carditis._ Inflammation of the heart is attended with unequal\r\nintermitting pulse, palpitation, pain in the middle of the sternum, and\r\nconstant vomiting. It cannot certainly be distinguished from peripneumony,\r\nand is perhaps always combined with it.\r\n\r\n8. _Peritonitis._ Inflammation of the peritonæum is known by pain all over\r\nthe abdomen, which is increased on erecting the body. It has probably most\r\nfrequently a rheumatic origin. See Class II. 1. 2. 17.\r\n\r\n9. _Mesenteritis._ Inflammation of the mesentery is attended with pains\r\nlike colic, and with curdled or chyle-like stools. It is a very frequent\r\nand dangerous disease, as the production of matter more readily takes place\r\nin it than in any other viscus. The consequence of which, after a hard\r\nlabour, is probably the puerperal fever, and in scrophulous habits a fatal\r\npurulent fever, or hopeless consumption.\r\n\r\nM. M. Venesection. Warm bath. Emollient clysters.\r\n\r\n10. _Gastritis._ In inflammation of the stomach the pulse is generally\r\nsoft, probably occasioned by the sickness which attends it. The pain and\r\nheat of the stomach is increased by whatever is swallowed, with immediate\r\nrejection of it. Hiccough.\r\n\r\nThis disease may be occasioned by acrid or indigestible matters taken into\r\nthe stomach, which may chemically or mechanically injure its interior coat.\r\nThere is however a slighter species of inflammation of this viscus, and\r\nperhaps of all others, which is unattended by much fever; and which is\r\nsometimes induced by drinking cold water, or eating cold insipid food, as\r\nraw turnips, when the person has been much heated and fatigued by exercise.\r\nFor when the sensorial power has been diminished by great exertion, and the\r\nstomach has become less irritable by having been previously stimulated by\r\nmuch heat, it sooner becomes quiescent by the application of cold. In\r\nconsequence of this slight inflammation of the stomach an eruption of the\r\nface frequently ensues by the sensitive association of this viscus with the\r\nskin, which is called a surfeit. See Class IV. 1. 2. 13. and II. 1. 4. 6.\r\nand II. 1. 3. 19.\r\n\r\nM. M. Venesection. Warm bath. Blister. Anodyne clysters. Almond soap. See\r\nClass II. 1. 3. 17.\r\n\r\n11. _Enteritis._ Inflammation of the bowels is often attended with soft\r\npulse, probably owing to the concomitant sickness; which prevents sometimes\r\nthe early use of the lancet, to the destruction of the patient. At other\r\ntimes it is attended with strong and full pulse like other inflammations of\r\ninternal membranes. Can the seat of the disease being higher or lower in\r\nthe intestinal canal, that is, above or below the valve of the colon,\r\nproduce this difference of pulse by the greater sympathy of one part of the\r\nbowels with the stomach than another? In enteritis with strong pulse the\r\npain is great about the navel, with vomiting, and the greatest difficulty\r\nin procuring a stool. In the other, the pain and fever is less, without\r\nvomiting, and with diarrhoea. Whence it appears, that the enteritis with\r\nhard quick pulse differs from Ileus, described in Class I. 3. 1. 6. only in\r\nthe existence of fever in the former and not the latter, the other symptoms\r\ngenerally corresponding; and, secondly, that the enteritis with softer\r\nquick pulse, differs from the cholera described in Class I. 3. 1. 5. only\r\nin the existence of fever in the former, and not the latter, the other\r\nsymptoms being in general similar. See Class II. 1. 3. 20.\r\n\r\nInflammation of the bowels sometimes is owing to extraneous indigestible\r\nsubstances, as plum-stones, especially of the damasin, which has sharp\r\nends. Sometimes to an introsusception of one part of the intestine into\r\nanother, and very frequently to a strangulated hernia or rupture. In\r\nrespect to the first, I knew an instance where a damasin stone, after a\r\nlong period of time, found its way out of the body near the groin. I knew\r\nanother child, who vomited some damasin stones, which had lain for near\r\ntwenty hours, and given great pain about the navel, by the exhibition of an\r\nemetic given in repeated doses for about an hour. The swallowing of\r\nplum-stones in large quantities, and even of cherry-stones, is annually\r\nfatal to many children. In respect to the introsusception and hernia, see\r\nIleus, Class I. 3. 1. 6.\r\n\r\nM. M. Repeated venesection. Calomel from ten to twenty grains given in\r\nsmall pills as in Ileus; these means used early in the disease generally\r\nsucceed. After these evacuations a blister contributes to stop the\r\nvomiting. Warm bath. Crude mercury. Aloes one grain-pill every hour will\r\nfrequently stay in the stomach. Glauber's salt dissolved in pepper-mint\r\nwater given by repeated spoonfuls.\r\n\r\nWhen the patient is much reduced, opium in very small doses may be given,\r\nas a quarter of a grain, as recommended in pleurisy. If the pain suddenly\r\nceases, and the patient continues to vomit up whatever is given him, it is\r\ngenerally fatal; as it indicates, that a mortification of the bowel is\r\nalready formed. Some authors have advised to join cathartic medicines with\r\nan opiate in inflammation of the bowels, as recommended in colica\r\nsaturnina. This may succeed in slighter cases, but is a dangerous practice\r\nin general; since, if the obstruction be not removed by the evacuation, the\r\nstimulus of the opium is liable to increase the action of the vessels, and\r\nproduce mortification of the bowel, as I think I have seen more than once.\r\n\r\n12. _Hepatitis._ Inflammation of the liver is attended with strong quick\r\npulse; tension and pain of the right side; often pungent as in pleurisy,\r\noftner dull. A pain is said to affect the clavicle, and top of the right\r\nshoulder; with difficulty in lying on the left side; difficult respiration;\r\ndry cough; vomiting; hiccough.\r\n\r\nThere is another hepatitis mentioned by authors, in which the fever, and\r\nother symptoms, are wanting, or are less violent; as described in Class II.\r\n1. 4. 12. and which is probably sometimes relieved by eruptions of the\r\nface; as in those who are habituated to the intemperate use of fermented\r\nliquors.\r\n\r\nM. M. Hepatic inflammation is very liable to terminate in suppuration, and\r\nthe patient is destroyed by the continuance of a fever with sizy blood, but\r\nwithout night-sweats, or diarrhoea, as in other unopened abscesses. Whence\r\ncopious and repeated venesection is required early in the disease, with\r\nrepeated doses of calomel, and cathartics. Warm bath. Towards the end of\r\nthe disease small doses of opium before the evening paroxysms, and lastly\r\nthe Peruvian bark, and chalybeate wine, at first in small doses, as 20\r\ndrops twice a day, and afterwards, if necessary, in larger. See Art. IV. 2.\r\n6.\r\n\r\nMrs. C. a lady in the last month of her pregnancy, was seized with violent\r\nhepatitis, with symptoms both of peripneumony and of pleurisy, for it\r\nseldom happens in violent inflammations, that one viscus alone is affected;\r\nshe wanted then about a fortnight of her delivery, and after frequent\r\nvenesection, with gentle cathartics, with fomentation or warm bath, she\r\nrecovered and was safely delivered, and both herself and child did well.\r\nRheumatic and eruptive fevers are more liable to induce abortion.\r\n\r\n13. _Splenitis._ Inflammation of the spleen commences with tension, heat,\r\nand tumour of the left side, and with pain, which is increased by pressure.\r\nA case is described in Class I. 2. 3. 18. where a tumid spleen, attended\r\nwith fever, terminated in schirrus of that viscus.\r\n\r\n14. _Nephritis._ Inflammation of the kidney seems to be of two kinds; each\r\nof them attended with different symptoms, and different modes of\r\ntermination. One of them I suppose to be an inflammation of the external\r\nmembrane of the kidney, arising from general causes of inflammation, and\r\naccompanied with pain in the loins without vomiting; and the other to\r\nconsist in an inflammation of the interior parts of the kidney, occasioned\r\nby the stimulus of gravel in the pelvis of it, which is attended with\r\nperpetual vomiting, with pain along the course of the ureter, and\r\nretraction of the testis on that side, or numbness of the thigh.\r\n\r\nThe former of these kinds of nephritis is distinguished from lumbago by its\r\nsituation being more exactly on the region of the kidney, and by its not\r\nbeing extended beyond that part; after three or four days I believe this\r\ninflammation is liable to change place; and that a herpes or erysipelas,\r\ncalled zona, or shingles, breaks out about the loins in its stead; at other\r\ntimes it is cured by a cathartic with calomel, with or without previous\r\nvenesection.\r\n\r\nThe other kind of nephritis, or inflammation of the interior part of the\r\nkidney, generally arises from the pain occasioned by the stimulus of a\r\nstone entering the ureter from the pelvis of the kidney; and, which ceases\r\nwhen the stone is protruded forwards into the bladder; or when it is\r\nreturned into the pelvis of the kidney by the retrograde action of the\r\nureter. The kidney is nevertheless inflamed more frequently, though in a\r\nless degree, from other causes; especially from the intemperate\r\ningurgitation of ale, or other fermented or spirituous liquors. This less\r\ndegree of inflammation is the cause of gravel, as that before mentioned is\r\nthe effect of it. The mucus secreted to lubricate the internal surface of\r\nthe uriniferous tubes of the kidney becomes secreted in greater quantity,\r\nwhen these vessels are inflamed; and, as the correspondent absorbent\r\nvessels act more energetically at the same time, the absorption of its more\r\nfluid parts is more powerfully effected; on both these accounts the mucus\r\nbecomes both changed in quality and more indurated. And in this manner\r\nstones are produced on almost every mucous membrane of the body; as in the\r\nlungs, bowels, and even in the pericordium, as some writers have affirmed.\r\nSee Class I. 1. 3. 9.\r\n\r\nM. M. Venesection. Ten grains of calomel given in small pills, then\r\ninfusion of sena with oil. Warm bath. Then opium a grain and half. See\r\nClass I. 1. 3. 9. for a further account of the method of cure.\r\n\r\n15. _Cystitis._ Inflammation of the bladder is attended with tumor and pain\r\nof the lower part of the belly; with difficult and painful micturition; and\r\ntenesmus. It generally is produced by the existence of a large stone in the\r\nbladder, when in a great degree; or is produced by common causes, when in a\r\nslighter degree.\r\n\r\nThe stone in the bladder is generally formed in the kidney, and passing\r\ndown the ureter into the bladder becomes there gradually increased in size;\r\nand this most frequently by the apposition of concentric spheres, as may be\r\nseen by sawing some of the harder calculi through the middle, and polishing\r\none surface. These new concretions superinduced on the nucleus, which\r\ndescended from the kidney, as described in Class I. 1. 3. 9. and in the\r\npreceding article of this genus, is not owing to the microcosmic salt,\r\nwhich is often seen to adhere to the sides of chamber-pots, as this is\r\nsoluble in warm water, but to the mucus of the bladder, as it rolls along\r\nthe internal surface of it. Now when the bladder is slightly inflamed, this\r\nmucus of its internal surface is secreted in greater quantity, and is more\r\nindurated by the absorption of its more liquid part at the instant of\r\nsecretion, as explained in Class I. 1. 3. 9. and II. 1. 2. 14. and thus the\r\nstimulus and pain of a stone in the bladder contributes to its enlargement\r\nby inflaming the interior coat of it.\r\n\r\nM. M. Venesection. Warm bath. Diluents. Anodyne clysters. See Class I. 1.\r\n3. 9.\r\n\r\n16. _Hysteritis._ Inflammation of the womb is accompanied with heat,\r\ntension, tumor, and pain of the lower belly. The os uteri painful to the\r\ntouch. Vomiting. This disease is generally produced by improper management\r\nin the delivery of pregnant women. I knew an unfortunate case, where the\r\nplacenta was left till the next day; and then an unskilful accoucheur\r\nintroduced his hand, and forcibly tore it away; the consequence was a most\r\nviolent inflammatory fever, with hard throbbing pulse, great pain, very\r\nsizy blood, and the death of the patient. Some accoucheurs have had a\r\npractice of introducing their hand into the uterus immediately after the\r\nbirth of the child, to take away the placenta; which they said was to save\r\ntime. Many women I believe have been victims to this unnatural practice.\r\n\r\nOthers have received injury, where inflammation has been beginning, by the\r\nuniversal practice of giving a large dose of opium immediately on delivery,\r\nwithout any indication of its propriety; which, though a proper and useful\r\nmedicine, where the patient is too feeble, when given in a small dose, as\r\n10 drops of tincture of opium, or half a grain of solid opium, must do a\r\nproportionate injury, when it is given improperly; and as delivery is a\r\nnatural process, it is certainly more wise to give no medicines, except\r\nthere be some morbid symptom, which requires it; and which has only been\r\nintroduced into custom by the ill-employed activity of the Priests or\r\nPriestesses of LUCINA; like the concomitant nonsense of cramming rue or\r\nrheubarb into the mouth of the unfortunate young stranger, who is thus soon\r\nmade to experience the evils of life. See Class II. 1. 1. 12. and I. 1. 2.\r\n5. Just so some over-wise beldames force young ducks and turkeys, as soon\r\nas they are hatched, to swallow a peppercorn.\r\n\r\nM. M. Venesection repeatedly; diluents; fomentation; the patient should be\r\nfrequently raised up in bed for a short time, to give opportunity of\r\ndischarge to the putrid lochia; mucilaginous clysters. See Febris Puerpera.\r\n\r\n17. _Lumbago sensitiva._ Sensitive lumbago. When the extensive membranes,\r\nor ligaments, which cover the muscles of the back are torpid, as in the\r\ncold paroxysm of ague, they are attended with pain in consequence of the\r\ninaction of the vessels, which compose them. When this inaction continues\r\nwithout a consequent renewal or increase of activity, the disease becomes\r\nchronical, and forms the lumbago frigida, or irritativa, described in Class\r\nI. 2. 4. 16. But when this cold fit or torpor of these membranes, or\r\nligaments or muscles of the back, is succeeded by a hot fit, and consequent\r\ninflammation, a violent inflammatory fever, with great pain, occurs,\r\npreventing the erect posture of the body; and the affected part is liable\r\nto suppurate, in which case a very dangerous ulcer is formed, and a part of\r\none of the vertebrae is generally found carious, and the patient sinks\r\nafter a long time under the hectic fever occasioned by the aerated or\r\noxygenated matter.\r\n\r\nThis disease bears no greater analogy to rheumatism than the inflammation\r\nof the pleura, or any other membranous inflammation; and has therefore\r\nunjustly been arranged under that name. It is distinguished from nephritis,\r\nas it is seldom attended with vomiting, I suppose never, except the ureter\r\nhappens to be inflamed at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe pain sometimes extends on the outside of the thigh from the hip to the\r\nankle, heel, or toes, and is then called sciatica; and has been thought to\r\nconsist in an inflammation of the theca, or covering of the sciatic nerve,\r\nas the pain sometimes so exactly attends the principal branches of that\r\nnerve. See Class I. 2. 4. 15. 16.\r\n\r\nM. M. Venesection repeatedly; calomel; gentle cathartics; diluents; warm\r\nbath; poultice on the back, consisting of camomile flowers, turpentine,\r\nsoap, and opium; a burgundy-pitch plaster. A debility of the inferior limbs\r\nfrom the torpor of the muscles, which had previously been too much excited,\r\nfrequently occurs at the end of this disease; in this case electricity, and\r\nissues on each side of the lumber vertebræ, are recommended. See Class I.\r\n2. 4. 16.\r\n\r\n18. _Ischias._ The ischias consists of inflammatory fever, with great pain\r\nabout the pelvis, the os coccigis, and the heads of the thigh-bones,\r\npreventing the patient from walking or standing erect, with increase of\r\npain on going to stool. This malady, as well as the preceding, has been\r\nascribed to rheumatism; with which it seems to bear no greater analogy,\r\nthan the inflammations of any other membranes.\r\n\r\nThe patients are left feeble, and sometimes lame after this disease; which\r\nis also sometimes accompanied with great flow of urine, owing to the\r\ndefective absorption of its aqueous parts; and with consequent thirst\r\noccasioned by the want of so much fluid being returned into the\r\ncirculation; a lodgment of fæces in the rectum sometimes occurs after this\r\ncomplaint from the lessened sensibility of it. See Class I. 2. 4. 15.\r\n\r\nM. M. Venesection; gentle cathartics; diluents; fomentation; poultice with\r\ncamomile flowers, turpentine, soap, and opium; afterwards the bark. See\r\nClass I. 1. 3. 5.\r\n\r\nWhen this inflammation terminates in suppuration the matter generally can\r\nbe felt to fluctuate in the groin, or near the top of the thigh. In this\r\ncircumstance, my friend Mr. Bent, Surgeon near Newcastle in Staffordshire,\r\nproposes to tap the abscess by means of a trocar, and thus as often as\r\nnecessary to discharge the matter without admitting the air. Might a weak\r\ninjection of wine and water, as in the hydrocele, be used with great\r\ncaution to inflame the walls of the abscess, and cause them to unite? See\r\nClass II. 1. 6. 9.\r\n\r\n19. _Paronychia interna._ Inflammation beneath the finger-nail. The pain\r\noccasioned by the inflammatory action and tumor of parts bound down between\r\nthe nail on one side and the bone on the other, neither of which will\r\nyield, is said to occasion so much pain as to produce immediate delirium,\r\nand even death, except the parts are divided by a deep incision; which must\r\npass quite through the periosteum, as the inflammation is said generally to\r\nexist beneath it. This disease is thus resembled by the process of toothing\r\nin young children; where an extraneous body lodged beneath the periosteum\r\ninduces pain and fever, and sometimes delirium, and requires to be set at\r\nliberty, by the lancet.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nORDO I.\r\n\r\n_Increased Sensation._\r\n\r\nGENUS III.\r\n\r\n_With the Production of new Vessels by external Membranes or Glands with\r\nFever._\r\n\r\nThe diseases of this genus are perhaps all productive of contagious matter;\r\nor which becomes so by its exposure to the air, either through the cuticle,\r\nor by immediate contact with it; such are the matters of the small-pox and\r\nmeasles. The purulent matter formed on parts covered from the air by\r\nthicker membranes or muscles, as in the preceding genus, does not induce\r\nfever, and cannot therefore be called contagious; but it acquires this\r\nproperty of producing fever in a few hours, after the abscess has been\r\nopened, so as to admit the air to its surface, and may then be said to\r\nconsist of contagious miasmata. This kind of contagious matter only induces\r\nfever, but does not produce other matter with properties similar to its\r\nown; and in this respect it differs from the contagious miasmata of\r\nsmall-pox or measles, but resembles those which have their origin in\r\ncrowded jails; for these produce fever only, which frequently destroys the\r\npatient; but do not produce other matters similar to themselves; as appears\r\nfrom none of those, who died of the jail-fever, caught at the famous black\r\nassizes at Oxford, at the beginning of this century, having infected their\r\nphysicians or attendants.\r\n\r\nIf indeed the matter has continued so long as to become putrid, and thus to\r\nhave given out air from a part of it, it acquires the power of producing\r\nfever; in the same manner as if the ulcer had been opened, and exposed to\r\nthe common air; instances of which are not unfrequent. And from these\r\ncircumstances it seems probable, that the matters secreted by the new\r\nvessels formed in all kinds of phlegmons, or pustles, are not contagious,\r\ntill they have acquired something from the atmosphere, or from the gas\r\nproduced by putrefaction; which will account for some phenomena in the lues\r\nvenerea, cancer, and of other contagious secretions on the skin without\r\nfever, to be mentioned hereafter. See Class II. 1. 4. 14.\r\n\r\nThe theory of contagion has been perplexed by comparing it with fermenting\r\nliquors; but the contagious material is shewn in Section XXXIII. to be\r\nproduced like other secreted matters by certain animal motions of the\r\nterminations of the vessels. Hence a new kind of gland is formed at the\r\nterminations of the vessels in the eruptions of the small-pox; the animal\r\nmotions of which produce from the blood variolous matter; as other glands\r\nproduce bile or saliva. Now if some of this matter is introduced beneath\r\nthe cuticle of a healthy person, or enters the circulation, and excites the\r\nextremities of the blood-vessels into those kinds of diseased motions, by\r\nwhich it was itself produced, either by irritation or association, these\r\ndiseased motions of the extremities of the vessels will produce other\r\nsimilar contagious matter. See Sect. XXXIII. 2. 5. and 9. Hence contagion\r\nseems to be propagated two ways; one, by the stimulus of contagious matter\r\napplied to the part, which by an unknown law of nature excites the\r\nstimulated vessels to produce a similar matter; as in venereal ulcers,\r\nwhich thus continue to spread; or as when variolous matter is inserted\r\nbeneath the cuticle; or when it is supposed to be absorbed, and diffused\r\nover the body mixed with the blood, and applied in that manner to the\r\ncutaneous glands. The other way, by which contagion seems to be diffused,\r\nis by some distant parts sympathizing or imitating the motions of the part\r\nfirst affected; as the stomach and skin in the eruptions of the inoculated\r\nsmall-pox, or in the bite of a mad dog; as treated of in Sect. XXII. 3. 3.\r\n\r\nIn some of the diseases of this genus the pulse is strong, full, and hard,\r\nconstituting the sensitive irritated fever, as described in the preceding\r\ngenus; as in one kind of erysipelas, which requires repeated venesection.\r\nIn others the arterial action is sometimes moderate, so as to constitute\r\nthe sensitive fever, as in the inoculated small-pox; where the action of\r\nthe arteries is neither increased by the sensorial power of irritation, as\r\nin the sensitive irritated fever; nor decreased by the defect of that\r\npower, as in the sensitive inirritated fever. But in the greatest number of\r\nthe diseases of this genus the arterial action is greatly diminished in\r\nrespect to strength, and consequently the frequency of pulsation is\r\nproportionally increased, as explained in Sect XXXII. 2. 1. Which is owing\r\nto the deficiency of the sensorial power of irritation joined with the\r\nincrease of that of sensation, and thus constitutes the sensitive\r\ninirritated fever; as in Scarlatina with gangrenous tonsils.\r\n\r\nFrom this great debility of the action of the arteries, there appears to be\r\nless of the coagulable lymph or mucus secreted on their internal surfaces;\r\nwhence there is not only a defect of that buff or size upon the blood,\r\nwhich is seen on the surface of that, which is drawn in the sensitive\r\nirritated fever; but the blood, as it cools, when it has been drawn into a\r\nbason, scarcely coagulates; and is said to be dissolved, and is by some\r\nsupposed to be in a state of actual putrefaction. See Sect. XXXIII. 1. 3.\r\nwhere the truth of this idea is controverted. But in the fevers of both\r\nthis genus and the preceding one great heat is produced from the chemical\r\ncombinations in the secretions of new vessels and fluids, and pain or\r\nuneasiness from the distention of the old ones; till towards the\r\ntermination of the disease sensation ceases, as well as irritation, with\r\nthe mortification of the affected parts, and the death of the patient.\r\n\r\nDysenteria, as well as tonsillitis and aphtha, are enumerated amongst the\r\ndiseases of external membranes, because they are exposed either to the\r\natmospheric air, which is breathed, and swallowed with our food and saliva;\r\nor they are exposed to the inflammable air; or hydrogen, which is generated\r\nin the intestines; both which contribute to produce or promote the\r\ncontagious quality of these fluids; as mentioned in Class II. 1. 5.\r\n\r\nIt is not speaking accurate language, if we say, that in the diseases of\r\nthis genus the fever is contagious; since it is the material produced by\r\nthe external membranes, which is contagious, after it has been exposed to\r\nair; while the fever is the consequence of this contagious matter, and not\r\nthe cause of it. As appears from the inoculated small-pox, in which the\r\nfever does not commence, till after suppuration has taken place in the\r\ninoculated arm, and from the diseases of the fifth genus of this order,\r\nwhere contagion exists without fever. See Class II. 1. 5. and II. 1. 3. 18.\r\n\r\nSPECIES.\r\n\r\n1. _Febris sensitiva inirritata._ Sensitive inirritated fever. Typhus\r\ngravior. Putrid malignant fever. Jail fever. The immediate cause of this\r\ndisease is the increase of the sensorial power of sensation, joined with\r\nthe decrease of the sensorial power of irritation; that is, it consists in\r\nthe febris sensitiva joined with the febris inirritativa of Class I. 2. 1.\r\n1. as the febris sensitiva irritata of the preceding genus consists of the\r\nfebris sensitiva joined with the febris irritativa of Class I. 1. 1. 1. In\r\nboth which the word irritata, and inirritata, are designed to express more\r\nor less irritation than the natural quantity; and the same when applied to\r\nsome of the diseases of this genus.\r\n\r\nThis fever is frequently accompanied with topical inflammation, which is\r\nliable, if the arterial strength is not supported, to end in sphacelus; and\r\nas mortified parts, such as sloughs of the throat, if they adhere to living\r\nparts, soon become putrid from the warmth and moisture of their situation;\r\nthese fevers have been termed putrid, and have been thought to owe their\r\ncause to what is only their consequence. In hot climates this fever is\r\nfrequently induced by the exhalations of stagnating lakes or marshes, which\r\nabound with animal substances; but which in colder countries produce fevers\r\nwith debility only, as the quartan ague, without inflammation.\r\n\r\nThe sensitive inirritated, or malignant, fever is also frequently produced\r\nby the putrid exhalations and stagnant air in prisons; but perhaps most\r\nfrequently by contact or near approach of the persons, who have resided in\r\nthem. These causes of malignant fevers contributed to produce, and to\r\nsupport for a while, the septic and antiseptic theory of them; see Sect.\r\nXXXIII. 1. 3. The vibices or bruises, and petechiæ or purples, were\r\nbelieved to be owing to the dissolved state of the blood by its incipient\r\nputrefaction; but hydrostatical experiments have been made, which shew the\r\nsizy blood of the patient in sensitive irritated or inflammatory fever,\r\nwith strong pulse, is more fluid, while it is warm, than this uncoagulable\r\nblood taken in this sensitive inirritated, or malignant fever; from whence\r\nit is inferred, that these petechiæ, and vibices, are owing to the\r\ndeficient power of absorption in the terminations of the veins, See Class\r\nI. 2. 1. 5.\r\n\r\nThis sensitive inirritated fever, or typhus gravior, is distinguished from\r\nthe inirritative fever, or typhus mitior, in the early stages of it, by the\r\ncolour of the skin; which in the latter is paler, with less heat, owing to\r\nthe less violent action of the capillaries; in this it is higher coloured,\r\nand hotter, from the greater energy of the capillary action in the\r\nproduction of new vessels. In the more advanced state petechiæ, and the\r\nproduction of contagious matter from inflamed membranes, as the aphthæ of\r\nthe mouth, or ulcers of the throat, distinguishes this fever from the\r\nformer. Delirium, and dilated pupils of the eyes, are more frequent in\r\nnervous fevers; and stupor with deafness more frequent attendants on\r\nmalignant fevers. See Class I. 2. 5. 6.\r\n\r\nThere is another criterion discernible by the touch of an experienced\r\nfinger; and that is, the coat of the artery in inflammatory fevers, both\r\nthose attended with strength of pulsation, and these with weak pulsation,\r\nfeels harder, or more like a cord; for the coats of the arteries in these\r\nfevers are themselves inflamed, and are consequently turgid with blood, and\r\nthence are less easily compressed, though their pulsations are nevertheless\r\nweak: when the artery is large or full with an inflamed coat, it is called\r\nhard; and when small or empty with an inflamed coat, it is called sharp, by\r\nmany writers.\r\n\r\nM. M. The indications of cure consist, 1. In procuring a regurgitation of\r\nany offensive material, which may be lodged in the long mouths of the\r\nlacteals or lymphatics, or in their tumid glands. 2. To excite the system\r\ninto necessary action by the repeated exhibition of nutrientia, sorbentia,\r\nand incitantia; and to preserve the due evacuation of the bowels. 3. To\r\nprevent any unnecessary expenditure of sensorial power. 4. To prevent the\r\nformation of ulcers, or to promote the absorption in them, for the purpose\r\nof healing them.\r\n\r\n1. One ounce of wine of ipecacuanha, or about ten grains of the powder,\r\nshould be given as an emetic. After a few hours three or four grains of\r\ncalomel should be given in a little mucilage, or conserve. Where something\r\nswallowed into the stomach is the cause of the fever, it is liable to be\r\narrested by the lymphatic glands, as the matter of the small-pox inoculated\r\nin the arm is liable to be stopped by the axillary lymphatic gland; in this\r\nsituation it may continue a day or two, or longer, and may be regurgitated\r\nduring the operation of an emetic or cathartic into the stomach or bowel,\r\nas evidently happens on the exhibition of calomel, as explained in Sect.\r\nXXIX. 7. 2. For this reason an emetic and cathartic, with venesection, if\r\nindicated by the hardness and fulness of the pulse, will very frequently\r\nremove fevers, if exhibited on the first, second, or even third day.\r\n\r\n2. Wine and opium, in small doses repeated frequently, but so that not the\r\nleast degree of intoxication follows, for in that case a greater degree of\r\ndebility is produced from the expenditure of sensorial power in unnecessary\r\nmotions. Many weak patients have been thus stimulated to death. See Sect.\r\nXII. 7. 8. The Peruvian bark should be given also in repeated doses in such\r\nquantity only as may strengthen digestion, not impede it. For these\r\npurposes two ounces of wine, or of ale, or cyder, should be given every six\r\nhours; and two ounces of decoction of bark, with two drachms of the\r\ntincture of bark, and six drops of tincture of opium, should be given also\r\nevery six hours alternately; that is, each of them four times in\r\ntwenty-four hours. As much rhubarb as may induce a daily evacuation, should\r\nbe given to remove the colluvies of indigested materials from the bowels;\r\nwhich might otherwise increase the distress of the patient by the air it\r\ngives out in putrefaction, or by producing a diarrhoea by its acrimony; the\r\nputridity of the evacuations are in consequence of the total inability of\r\nthe digestive powers; and their delay in the intestines, to the inactivity\r\nof that canal in respect to its peristaltic motions.\r\n\r\nThe quantities of wine or beer and opium, and bark, above mentioned, may be\r\nincreased by degrees, if the patient seems refreshed by them; and if the\r\npulse becomes slower on their exhibition; but this with caution, as I have\r\nseen irrecoverable mischief done by greater quantities both of opium, wine,\r\nand bark, in this kind of fever; in which their use is to strengthen the\r\ndigestion of the weak patient, rather than to stop the paroxysms of fever;\r\nbut when they are administered in intermittents, much larger quantities are\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe stimulus of small blisters applied in succession, one every three or\r\nfour days, when the patient becomes weak, is of great service by\r\nstrengthening digestion, and by preventing the coldness of the extremities,\r\nowing to the sympathy of the skin with the stomach, and of one part of the\r\nskin with another.\r\n\r\nIn respect to nutriment, the patient should be supplied with wine and\r\nwater, with toasted bread, and sugar or spice in it; or with sago with\r\nwine; fresh broth with turnips, cellery, parsley; fruit; new milk. Tea with\r\ncream and sugar; bread pudding, with lemon juice and sugar; chicken, fish,\r\nor whatever is grateful to the palate of the sick person, in small quantity\r\nrepeated frequently; with small beer, cyder and water, or wine and water,\r\nfor drink, which may be acidulated with acid of vitriol in small\r\nquantities.\r\n\r\n3. All unnecessary motions are to be checked, or prevented. Hence\r\nhorizontal posture, obscure room, silence, cool air. All the parts of the\r\nskin, which feel too hot to the hand, should be exposed to a current of\r\ncool air, or bathed with cold water, whether there are eruptions on it or\r\nnot. Wash the patient twice a day with cold vinegar and water, or cold salt\r\nand water, or cold water alone, by means of a sponge. If some parts are too\r\ncold, as the extremities, while other parts are too hot, as the face or\r\nbreast, cover the cold parts with flannel, and cool the hot parts by a\r\ncurrent of cool air, or bathing them as above.\r\n\r\n4. For the healing of ulcers, if in the mouth, solution of alum in water\r\nabout 40 grains to an ounce, or of blue vitriol in water, one grain or two\r\nto an ounce may be used to touch them with three or four times a day. Of\r\nthese perhaps a solution of alum is to be preferred, as it instantly takes\r\naway the stench from ulcers I suppose by combining with the volatile alcali\r\nwhich attends it. For this purpose a solution of alum of an ounce to a pint\r\nof water should be frequently injected by means of a syringe into the\r\nmouth. If there are ulcers on the external skin, fine powder of bark seven\r\nparts, and cerusia in fine powder one part, should be mixed, and applied\r\ndry on the sore, and kept on by lint, and a bandage.\r\n\r\nAs sloughs in the mouth are frequently produced by the previous dryness of\r\nthe membranes, which line it, this dryness should be prevented by\r\nfrequently moistening them, which may be effected by injection with a\r\nsyringe, or by a moist sponge, or lastly in the following manner. Place a\r\nglass of wine and water, or of milk and sugar, on a table by the bedside, a\r\nlittle above the level of the mouth of the patient; then, having previously\r\nmoistened a long piece of narrow listing, or cloth, or flannel, with the\r\nsame liquor, leave one end of it in the glass, and introduce the other into\r\nthe mouth of the patient; which will thus be supplied with a constant\r\noozing of the fluid through the cloth, which acts as a capillary syphon.\r\n\r\nThe viscid phlegm, which adheres to the tongue, should be coagulated by\r\nsome austere acid, as by lemon-juice evaporated to half its quantity, or by\r\ncrab-juice; and then it may be scraped off by a knife, or rubbed off by\r\nflannel, or a sage leaf dipped in vinegar, or in salt and water.\r\n\r\n2. _Erysipelas_, St. Anthony's fire, may be divided into three kinds, which\r\ndiffer in their method of cure, the irritated, the inirritated, and the\r\nsensitive erysipelas.\r\n\r\n_Erysipelas irritatum_ is attended with increase of irritation besides\r\nincrease of sensation; that is, with strong, hard, and full pulse, which\r\nrequires frequent venesection, like other inflammations with arterial\r\nstrength. It is distinguished from the phlegmonic inflammations of the last\r\ngenus by its situation on the external habit, and by the redness, heat, and\r\ntumour not being distinctly circumscribed; so that the eye or finger cannot\r\nexactly trace the extent of them.\r\n\r\nWhen the external skin is the seat of inflammation, and produces sensitive\r\nirritated fever, no collection of matter is formed, as when a phlegmon is\r\nsituated in the cellular membrane beneath the skin; but the cuticle rises\r\nas beneath a blister-plaster, and becomes ruptured; and a yellow material\r\noozes out, and becomes inspissated, and lies upon its surface; as is seen\r\nin this kind of erysipelas, and in the confluent small-pox; or if the new\r\nvessels are reabsorbed the cuticle peels off in scales. This difference of\r\nthe termination of erysipelatous and phlegmonic inflammation seems to be\r\nowing in part to the less distensibility of the cuticle than of the\r\ncellular membrane, and in part to the ready exhalation of the thinner parts\r\nof the secreted fluids through its pores.\r\n\r\nThis erysipelas is generally preceded by a fever for two or three days\r\nbefore the eruption, which is liable to appear in some places, as it\r\ndeclines in others; and seems frequently to arise from a previous scratch\r\nor injury of the skin; and is attended sometimes with inflammation of the\r\ncellular membrane beneath the skin; whence a real phlegmon and collection\r\nof matter becomes joined to the erysipelas, and either occasions or\r\nincreases the irritated fever, which attends it.\r\n\r\nThere is a greater sympathy between the external skin and the meninges of\r\nthe brain, than between the cellular membrane and those meninges; whence\r\nerysipelas is more liable to be preceded or attended, or succeeded, by\r\ndelirium than internal phlegmons. I except the mumps, or parotitis,\r\ndescribed below; which is properly an external gland, as its excretory duct\r\nopens into the air. When pain of the head or delirium precedes the\r\ncutaneous eruption of the face, there is some reason to believe, that the\r\nprimary disease is a torpor of the meninges of the brain; and that the\r\nsucceeding violent action is transferred to the skin of the face by\r\nsensitive association; and that a similar sympathy occurs between some\r\ninternal membranes and the skin over them, when erysipelas appears on other\r\nparts of the body. If this circumstance should be supported by further\r\nevidence, this disease should be removed into Class IV. along with the\r\nrheumatism and gout. See Class IV. 1. 2. 17.\r\n\r\nThis supposed retropulsion of erysipelas on the brain from the frequent\r\nappearance of delirium, has prevented the free use of the lancet early in\r\nthis disease to the destruction of many; as it has prevented the subduing\r\nof the general inflammation, and thus has in the end produced the\r\nparticular one on the brain. Mr. B----, a delicate gentleman about sixty,\r\nhad an erysipelas beginning near one ear, and extending by degrees over the\r\nwhole head, with hard, full, and strong pulse; blood was taken from him\r\nfour or five times in considerable quantity, with gentle cathartics, with\r\ncalomel, diluents, and cool air, and he recovered without any signs of\r\ndelirium, or inflammation of the meninges of the brain. Mr. W----, a strong\r\ncorpulent man of inferior life, had erysipelas over his whole head, with\r\nstrong hard pulse: he was not evacuated early in the disease through the\r\ntimidity of his apothecary, and died delirious. Mrs. F---- had erysipelas\r\non the face, without either strong or weak pulse; that is, with sensitive\r\nfever alone, without superabundance or deficiency of irritation; and\r\nrecovered without any but natural evacuations. From these three cases of\r\nerysipelas on the head it appears, that the evacuations by the lancet must\r\nbe used with courage, where the degree of inflammation requires it; but not\r\nwhere this degree of inflammation is small, nor in the erysipelas attended\r\nwith inirritation, as described below.\r\n\r\nM. M. Venesection repeated according to the degree of inflammation. An\r\nemetic. Calomel three grains every other night. Cool air. Diluents, emetic\r\ntartar in small doses, as a quarter of a grain every six hours. Tea, weak\r\nbroth, gruel, lemonade, neutral salts. See Sect. XII. 6.\r\n\r\nSuch external applications as carry away the heat of the skin may be of\r\nservice, as cold water, cold flour, snow, ether. Because these applications\r\nimpede the exertions of the secerning vessels, which are now in too great\r\naction; but any applications of the stimulant kind, as solutions of lead,\r\niron, copper, or of alum, used early in the disease, must be injurious; as\r\nthey stimulate the secerning vessels, as well as the absorbent vessels,\r\ninto greater action; exactly as occurs when stimulant eye-waters are used\r\ntoo soon in ophthalmy. See Class II. 1. 2. 2. But as the cuticle peels off\r\nin this case after the inflammation ceases, it differs from ophthalmy; and\r\nstimulant applications are not indicated at all, except where symptoms of\r\ngangrene appear. For as a new cuticle is formed under the old one, as under\r\na blister, the serous fluid between them is a defence to the new cuticle,\r\nand should dry into a scab by exhalation rather than be reabsorbed. Hence\r\nwe see how greasy or oily applications, and even how moist ones, are\r\ninjurious in erysipelas; because they prevent the exhalation of the serous\r\neffusion between the old and new cuticle, and thus retard the formation of\r\nthe latter.\r\n\r\n_Erysipelas inirritatum_ differs from the former in its being attended with\r\nweak pulse, and other symptoms of sensitive inirritated fever. The feet and\r\nlegs are particularly liable to this erysipelas, which precedes or attends\r\nthe sphacelus or mortification of those parts. A great and long coldness\r\nfirst affects the limb, and the erysipelas on the skin seems to occur in\r\nconsequence of the previous torpor of the interior membranes. As this\r\ngenerally attends old age, it becomes more dangerous in proportion to the\r\nage, and also to the habitual intemperance of the patient in respect to the\r\nuse of fermented or spirituous liquor.\r\n\r\nWhen the former kind, or irritated erysipelas, continues long, the patient\r\nbecomes so weakened as to be liable to all the symptoms of this inirritated\r\nerysipelas; especially where the meninges of the brain are primarily\r\naffected. As in that case, after two or three efforts have been made to\r\nremove the returning periods of torpor of the meninges to the external\r\nskin, those meninges become inflamed themselves, and the patient sinks\r\nunder the disease; in a manner similar to that in old gouty patients, where\r\nthe torpor of the liver or stomach is relieved by association of the\r\ninflammation of the membranes of the feet, and then of other joints, and\r\nlastly the power of association ceasing to act, but the excess of sensation\r\ncontinuing, the liver or stomach remains torpid, or become themselves\r\ninflamed, and the patient is destroyed.\r\n\r\nM. M. Where there exists a beginning gangrene of the extremities, the\r\nPeruvian bark, and wine, and opium, are to be given in large quantities; so\r\nas to strengthen the patient, but not to intoxicate, or to impede his\r\ndigestion of aliment, as mentioned in the first species of this genus.\r\nClass II. 1. 2. 1. But where the brain is inflamed or oppressed, which is\r\nknown either by delirium, with quick pulse; or by stupor, and slow\r\nrespiration with slow pulse; other means must be applied. Such as, first, a\r\nfomentation on the head with warm water, with or without aromatic herbs, or\r\nsalt in it, should be continued for an hour or two at a time, and\r\nfrequently repeated. A blister may also be applied on the head, and the\r\nfomentation nevertheless occasionally repeated. Internally very gentle\r\nstimulants, as camphor one grain or two in infusion of valerian. Wine and\r\nwater or small beer, weak broth. An enema. Six grains of rhubarb and one of\r\ncalomel. Afterwards five drops of tincture of opium, which may be repeated\r\nevery six hours, if it seems of service. Might the head be bathed for a\r\nminute with cold water? or with ether? or vinegar?\r\n\r\n_Erysipelas sensitivum_ is a third species, differing only in the kind of\r\nfever which attends it, which is simply inflammatory, or sensitive, without\r\neither excess of irritation, as in the first variety; or the defect of\r\nirritation, as in the second variety: all these kinds of erysipelas are\r\nliable to return by periods in some people, who have passed the middle of\r\nlife, as at periods of a lunation, or two lunations, or at the equinoxes.\r\nWhen these periods of erysipelas happen to women, they seem to supply the\r\nplace of the receding catamenia; when to men, I have sometimes believed\r\nthem to be associated with a torpor of the liver; as they generally occur\r\nin those who have drank vinous spirit excessively, though not\r\napprobriously; and that hence they supply the place of periodical piles, or\r\ngout, or gutta rosea.\r\n\r\nM. M. As the fever requires no management, the disease takes its progress\r\nsafely, like a moderate paroxysm of the gout; but in this case, as in some\r\nof the former, the erysipelas does not appear to be a primary disease, and\r\nshould perhaps be removed to the Class of Association.\r\n\r\n3. _Tonsillitis._ Inflammation of the tonsils. The uncouth term Cynanche\r\nhas been used for diseases so dissimilar, that I have divided them into\r\nTonsillitis and Parotitis; and hope to be excused for adding a Greek\r\ntermination to a Latin word, as one of those languages may justly be\r\nconsidered as a dialect of the other. By tonsillitis the inflammation of\r\nthe tonsils is principally to be understood; but as all inflammations\r\ngenerally spread further than the part first affected; so, when the summit\r\nof the windpipe is also much inflamed, it may be termed tonsillitis\r\ntrachealis, or croup. See Class I. 1. 3. 4. and II. 1. 2. 4.; and when the\r\nsummit of the gullet is much inflamed along with the tonsil, it may be\r\ncalled tonsillitis pharyngea, as described in Dr. Cullen's Nosologia, Genus\r\nX. p. 92. The inflammation of the tonsils may be divided into three kinds,\r\nwhich require different methods of cure.\r\n\r\n_Tonsillitis interna._ Inflammation of the internal tonsil. When the\r\nswelling is so considerable as to produce difficulty of breathing, the size\r\nof the tonsil should be diminished by cutting it with a proper lancet,\r\nwhich may either give exit to the matter it contains, or may make it less\r\nby discharging a part of the blood. This kind of angina is frequently\r\nattended with irritated fever besides the sensitive one, which accompanies\r\nall inflammation, and sometimes requires venesection. An emetic should be\r\ngiven early in the disease, as by its inducing the retrograde action of the\r\nvessels about the fauces during the nausea it occasions, it may eliminate\r\nthe very cause of the inflammation; which may have been taken up by the\r\nabsorbents, and still continue in the mouths of the lymphatics or their\r\nglands. The patient should then be induced to swallow some aperient liquid,\r\nan infusion of senna, so as to induce three or four evacuations. Gargles of\r\nall kinds are rather hurtful, as the action of using them is liable to give\r\npain to the inflamed parts; but the patients find great relief from\r\nfrequently holding warm water in their mouths, and putting it out again, or\r\nby syringing warm water into the mouth, as this acts like a warm bath or\r\nfomentation to the inflamed part. Lastly, some mild stimulant, as a weak\r\nsolution of salt and water, or of white vitriol and water, may be used to\r\nwash the fauces with in the decline of the disease, to expedite the\r\nabsorption of the new vessels, if necessary, as recommended in ophthalmy.\r\n\r\n_Tonsillitis superficialis._ Inflammation of the surface of the tonsils. As\r\nthe tonsils and parts in their vicinity are covered with a membrane, which,\r\nthough exposed to currents of air, is nevertheless constantly kept moist by\r\nmucus and saliva, and is liable to diseases of its surface like other\r\nmucous membranes, as well as to suppuration of the internal substance of\r\nthe gland; the inflammation of its surface is succeeded by small elevated\r\npustules with matter in them, which soon disappears, and the parts either\r\nreadily heal, or ulcers covered with sloughs are left on the surface.\r\n\r\nThis disease is generally attended with only sensitive fever, and therefore\r\nis of no danger, and may be distinguished with great certainty from the\r\ndangerous inflammation or gangrene of the tonsils at the height of the\r\nsmall-pox, or scarlet fever, by its not being attended with other symptoms\r\nof those diseases. One emetic and a gentle cathartic is generally\r\nsufficient; and the frequent swallowing of weak broth, or gruel, both\r\nwithout salt in them, relieves the patient, and absolves the cure. When\r\nthese tumours of the tonsils frequently return I have sometimes suspected\r\nthem to originate from the absorption of putrid matter from decaying teeth.\r\nSee Class I. 2. 3. 21. and II. 2. 2. 1.\r\n\r\n_Tonsillitis inirritata._ Inflammation of the tonsils with sensitive\r\ninirritated fever is a symptom only of contagious fever, whether attended\r\nwith scarlet eruption, or with confluent small-pox, or otherwise. The\r\nmatter of contagion is generally diffused, not dissolved in the air; and as\r\nthis is breathed over the mucaginous surface of the tonsils, the contagious\r\natoms are liable to be arrested by the tonsil; which therefore becomes the\r\nnest of the future disease, like the inflamed circle round the inoculated\r\npuncture of the arm in supposititious small-pox. This swelling is liable to\r\nsuffocate the patient in small-pox, and to become gangrenous in scarlet\r\nfever, and some other contagious fevers, which have been received in this\r\nmanner. The existence of inflammation of the tonsil previous to the scarlet\r\neruption, as the arm inflames in the inoculated small-pox, and suppurates\r\nbefore the variolous eruption, should be a criterion of the scarlet fever\r\nbeing taken in this manner.\r\n\r\nM. M. All the means which strengthen the patient, as in the sensitive\r\ninirritated fever, Class II. 1. 2. 1. As it is liable to continue a whole\r\nlunation or more, great attention should be used to nourish the patient\r\nwith acidulous and vinous panada, broth with vegetables boiled in it,\r\nsugar, cream, beer; all which given frequently will contribute much to\r\nmoisten, clean, and heal the ulcuscles, or sloughs, of the throat; warm\r\nwater and wine, or acid of lemon, should be frequently applied to the\r\ntonsils by means of a syringe, or by means of a capillary syphon, as\r\ndescribed in Class II. 1. 3. 1. A slight solution of blue vitriol, as two\r\ngrains to an ounce, or a solution of sugar of lead of about six grains to\r\nan ounce, may be of service; especially the latter, applied to the edges of\r\nthe sloughs, drop by drop by means of a small glass tube, or small\r\ncrow-quill with the end cut off, or by a camel's-hair pencil or sponge; to\r\nthe end of either of which a drop will conveniently hang by capillary\r\nattraction; as solutions of lead evidently impede the progress of\r\nerysipelas on the exterior skin, when it is attended with feeble pulse. Yet\r\na solution of alum injected frequently by a syringe is perhaps to be\r\npreferred, as it immediately removes the fetor of the breath, which must\r\nmuch injure the patient by its being perpetually received into the lungs by\r\nrespiration.\r\n\r\n4. _Parotitis._ Mumps, or branks, is a contagious inflammation of the\r\nparotis and maxillary glands, and has generally been classed under the word\r\nCynanche or Angina, to which it bears no analogy. It divides itself into\r\ntwo kinds, which differ in the degree of fever which attends them, and in\r\nthe method of cure.\r\n\r\n_Parotitis suppurans._ The suppurating mumps is to be distinguished by the\r\nacuteness of the pain, and the sensitive, irritated, or inflammatory fever,\r\nwhich attends it.\r\n\r\nM. M. Venesection. Cathartic with calomel three or four grains repeatedly.\r\nCool air, diluents. This antiphlogistic treatment is to be continued no\r\nlonger than is necessary to relieve the violence of the pain, as the\r\ndisease is attended with contagion, and must run through a certain time,\r\nlike other fevers with contagion.\r\n\r\n_Parotitis mutabilis._ Mutable parotitis. A sensitive fever only, or a\r\nsensitive irritated fever, generally attends this kind. And when the tumor\r\nof the parotis and maxillary glands subsides, a new swelling occurs in some\r\ndistant part of the system; as happens to the hands and feet, at the\r\ncommencement of the secondary fever of the small-pox, when the tumor of the\r\nface subsides. This new swelling in the parotitis mutabilis is liable to\r\naffect the testes in men, and form a painful tumor, which should be\r\nprevented from suppuration by very cautious means, if the violence of the\r\npain threaten such a termination; as by bathing the part with coldish water\r\nfor a time, venesection, a cathartic; or by a blister on the perinæum, or\r\nscrotum, or a poultice.\r\n\r\nWhen women are affected with this complaint, after the swelling of the\r\nparotis and maxillary glands subsides, a tumor with pain is liable to\r\naffect their breasts; which, however, I have never seen terminate in\r\nsuppuration.\r\n\r\nOn the retrocession of the tumor of the testes above described, and I\r\nsuppose of that of the breasts in women, a delirium of the calm kind is\r\nvery liable to occur; which in some cases has been the first symptom which\r\nhas alarmed the friends of the patient; and it has thence been difficult to\r\ndiscover the cause of it without much inquiry; the previous symptoms having\r\nbeen so slight as not to have occasioned any complaints. In this delirium,\r\nif the pulse will bear it, venesection should be used, and three or four\r\ngrains of calomel, with fomentation of the head with warm water for an hour\r\ntogether every three or four hours.\r\n\r\nThough this disease generally terminates favourably, considering the\r\nnumbers attacked by it, when it is epidemic, yet it is dangerous at other\r\ntimes in every part of its progress. Sometimes the parotis or maxillary\r\nglands suppurate, producing ulcers which are difficult to cure, and\r\nfrequently destroy the patient, where there was a previous scrophulous\r\ntendency. The testis in men is also liable to suppurate with great pain,\r\nlong confinement, and much danger; and lastly the affection of the brain is\r\nfatal to many.\r\n\r\nMr. W. W. had a swelled throat, which after a few days subsided. He became\r\ndelirious or stupid, in which state he was dying when I saw him; and his\r\nfriends ascribed his death to a coup de soleil, which he was said to have\r\nreceived some months before, when he was abroad.\r\n\r\nMr. A. B. had a swelling of the throat, which after a few days subsided.\r\nWhen I saw him he had great stupor, with slow breathing, and partial\r\ndelirium. On fomenting his head with warm water for an hour these symptoms\r\nof stupor were greatly lessened, and his oppressed breathing gradually\r\nceased, and he recovered in one day.\r\n\r\nMr. C. D. I found walking about the house in a calm delirium without\r\nstupor; and not without much inquiry of his friends could get the previous\r\nhistory of the disease; which had been attended with parotitis, and swelled\r\ntestis, previous to the delirium. A few ounces of blood were taken away, a\r\ngentle cathartic was directed, and his head fomented with warm water for an\r\nhour, with a small blister on the back, and he recovered in two or three\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nMr. D. D. came down from London in the coach alone, so that no previous\r\nhistory could be obtained. He was walking about the house in a calm\r\ndelirium, but could give no sensible answers to any thing which was\r\nproposed to him. His pulse was weak and quick. Cordials, a blister, the\r\nbark, were in vain exhibited, and he died in two or three days.\r\n\r\nMr. F. F. came from London in the same manner in the coach. He was mildly\r\ndelirious with considerable stupor, and moderate pulse, and could give no\r\naccount of himself. He continued in a kind of cataleptic stupor, so that he\r\nwould remain for hours in any posture he was placed, either in his chair,\r\nor in bed; and did not attempt to speak for about a fortnight; and then\r\ngradually recovered. These two last cases are not related as being\r\ncertainly owing to parotitis, but as they might probably have that origin.\r\n\r\nThe parotitis suppurans, or mumps with irritated fever, is at times\r\nepidemic among cats, and may be called _parotitis felina_; as I have reason\r\nto believe from the swellings under the jaws, which frequently suppurate,\r\nand are very fatal to those animals. In the village of Haywood, in\r\nStaffordshire, I remember a whole breed of Persian cats, with long white\r\nhair, was destroyed by this malady, along with almost all the common cats\r\nof the neighbourhood; and as the parotitis or mumps had not long before\r\nprevailed amongst human beings in that part of the country, I recollect\r\nbeing inclined to believe, that the cats received the infection from\r\nmankind; though in all other contagious diseases, except the rabies canina\r\ncan be so called, no different genera of animals naturally communicate\r\ninfection to each other; and I am informed, that vain efforts have been\r\nmade to communicate the small-pox and measles to some quadrupeds by\r\ninoculation. A disease of the head and neck destroyed almost all the cats\r\nin Westphalia. Savage, Nosol. Class X. Art. 30. 8.\r\n\r\n5. _Catarrhus sensitivus_ consists of an inflammation of the membrane,\r\nwhich lines the nostrils and fauces. It is attended with sensitive fever\r\nalone, and is cured by the steam of warm water externally, and by diluents\r\ninternally, with moderate venesection and gentle cathartics. This may be\r\ntermed catarrhus sensitivus, to distinguish it from the catarrhus\r\ncontagiosus, and is in common language called a violent cold in the head;\r\nit differs from the catarrhus calidus, or warm catarrh, of Class I. 1. 2.\r\n7. in the production of new vessels, or inflammation of the membrane, and\r\nthe consequent more purulent appearance of the discharge.\r\n\r\nRaucedo catarrhalis, or catarrhal hoarseness, is a frequent symptom of this\r\ndisease, and is occasioned by the pain or soreness which attends the\r\nthickened and inflamed membranes of the larynx; which prevents the muscles\r\nof vocallity from sufficiently contracting the aperture of it. It ceases\r\nwith the inflammation, or may be relieved by the steam of warm water alone,\r\nor of water and vinegar, or of water and ether. See Paralytic Hoarseness,\r\nClass III. 2. 1. 4.\r\n\r\n6. _Catarrhus contagiosus._ This malady attacks so many at the same time,\r\nand spreads gradually over so great an extent of country, that there can be\r\nno doubt but that it is disseminated by the atmosphere. In the year 1782\r\nthe sun was for many weeks obscured by a dry fog, and appeared red as\r\nthrough a common mist. The material, which thus rendered the air muddy,\r\nprobably caused the epidemic catarrh, which prevailed in that year, and\r\nwhich began far in the north, and extended itself over all Europe. See\r\nBotanic Garden, Vol. II. note on Chunda, and Vol. I. Canto IV, line 294,\r\nnote; and was supposed to have been thrown out of a volcano, which much\r\ndisplaced the country of Iceland.\r\n\r\nIn many instances there was reason to believe, that this disease became\r\ncontagious, as well as epidemic; that is, that one person might receive it\r\nfrom another, as well as by the general unsalutary influence of the\r\natmosphere. This is difficult to comprehend, but may be conceived by\r\nconsidering the increase of contagious matter in the small-pox. In that\r\ndisease one particle of contagious matter stimulates the skin of the arm in\r\ninoculation into morbid action so as to produce a thousand particles\r\nsimilar to itself; the same thing occurs in catarrh, a few deleterious\r\natoms stimulate the mucous membrane of the nostrils into morbid actions,\r\nwhich produce a thousand other particles similar to themselves. These\r\ncontagious particles diffused in the air must have consisted of animal\r\nmatter, otherwise how could an animal body by being stimulated by them\r\nproduce similar particles? Could they then have had a volcanic origin, or\r\nmust they not rather have been blown from putrid marshes full of animal\r\nmatter? But the greatest part of the solid earth has been made from animal\r\nand vegetable recrements, which may be dispersed by volcanos.--Future\r\ndiscoveries must answer these questions.\r\n\r\nAs the sensitive fever attending these epidemic catarrhs is seldom either\r\nmuch irritated or inirritated, venesection is not always either clearly\r\nindicated or forbid; but as those who have died of these catarrhs have\r\ngenerally had inflamed livers, with consequent suppuration in them,\r\nvenesection is adviseable, wherever the cough and fever are greater than\r\ncommon, so as to render the use of the lancet in the least dubious. And in\r\nsome cases a second bleeding was necessary, and a mild cathartic or two\r\nwith four grains of calomel; with mucilaginous subacid diluents; and warm\r\nsteam occasionally to alleviate the cough, finished the cure.\r\n\r\nThe catarrhus contagiosus is a frequent disease amongst horses and dogs; it\r\nseems first to be disseminated amongst these animals by miasmata diffused\r\nin the atmosphere, because so many of them receive it at the same time; and\r\nafterwards to be communicable from one horse or dog to another by\r\ncontagion, as above described. These epidemic or contagious catarrhs more\r\nfrequently occur amongst dogs and horses than amongst men; which is\r\nprobably owing to the greater extension and sensibility of the mucous\r\nmembrane, which covers the organ of smell, and is diffused over their wide\r\nnostrils, and their large maxillary and frontal cavities. And to this\r\ncircumstance may be ascribed the greater fatality of it to these animals.\r\n\r\nIn respect to horses, I suspect the fever at the beginning to be of the\r\nsensitive, irritated, or inflammatory kind, because there is so great a\r\ndischarge of purulent mucus; and that therefore they will bear once\r\nbleeding early in the disease; and also one mild purgative, consisting of\r\nabout half an ounce of aloe, and as much white hard soap, mixed together.\r\nThey should be turned out to grass both day and night for the benefit of\r\npure air, unless the weather be too cold (and in that case they should be\r\nkept in an open airy stable, without being tied), that they may hang down\r\ntheir heads to facilitate the discharge of the mucus from their nostrils.\r\nGrass should be offered them, or other fresh vegetables, as carrots and\r\npotatoes, with mashes of malt, or of oats, and with plenty of fresh warm or\r\ncold water frequently in a day. When symptoms of debility appear, which may\r\nbe known by the coldness of the ears or other extremities, or when sloughs\r\ncan be seen on the membrane which lines the nostrils, a drink consisting of\r\na pint of ale with half an ounce of tincture of opium in it, given every\r\nsix hours, is likely to be of great utility.\r\n\r\nIn dogs I believe the catarrh is generally joined with symptoms of debility\r\nearly in the disease. These animals should be permitted to go about in the\r\nopen air, and should have constant access to fresh water. The use of being\r\nas much as may be in the air is evident, because all the air which they\r\nbreathe passes twice over the putrid sloughs of the mortified parts of the\r\nmembrane which lines the nostrils, and the maxillary and frontal cavities;\r\nthat is, both during inspiration and expiration; and must therefore be\r\nloaded with contagious particles. Fresh new milk, and fresh broth, should\r\nbe given them very frequently, and they should be suffered to go amongst\r\nthe grass, which they sometimes eat for the purpose of an emetic; and if\r\npossible should have access to a running stream of water. As the contagious\r\nmucus of the nostrils, both of these animals and of horses, generally drops\r\ninto the water they attempt to drink. Bits of raw flesh, if the dog will\r\neat them, are preferred to cooked meat; and from five to ten drops of\r\ntincture of opium may be given with advantage, when symptoms of debility\r\nare evident, according to the size of the dog, every six hours. If sloughs\r\ncan be seen in the nostrils, they should be moistened twice a day, both in\r\nhorses and dogs, with a solution of sugar of lead, or of alum, by means of\r\na sponge fixed on a bit of whale bone, or by a syringe. The lotion may be\r\nmade by dissolving half an ounce of sugar of lead in a pint of water.\r\n\r\nAncient philosophers seem to have believed, that the contagious miasmata in\r\ntheir warm climates affected horses and dogs previous to mankind. If those\r\ncontagious particles were supposed to be diffused amongst the heavy\r\ninflammable air, or carbonated hydrogen, of putrid marshes, as these\r\nanimals hold their heads down lower to the ground, they may be supposed to\r\nhave received them sooner than men. And though men and quadrupeds might\r\nreceive a disease from the same source of marsh-putrefaction, they might\r\nnot afterwards be able to infect each other, though they might infect other\r\nanimals of the same genus; as the new contagious matter generated in their\r\nown bodies might not be precisely similar to that received; as happened in\r\nthe jail-fever at Oxford, where those who took the contagion and died, did\r\nnot infect others.\r\n\r\n  On mules and dogs the infection first began,\r\n  And, last, the vengeful arrows fix'd on man.\r\n                          POPE'S Homer's Iliad, I.\r\n\r\n7. _Peripneumonia superficialis._ The superficial or spurious peripneumony\r\nconsists in an inflammation of the membrane, which lines the bronchia, and\r\nbears the same analogy to the true peripneumony, as the inflammations of\r\nother membranes do to that of the parenchyma, or substantial parts of the\r\nviscus, which they surround. It affects elderly people, and frequently\r\noccasions their death; and exists at the end of the true peripneumony, or\r\nalong with it; when the lancet has not been used sufficiently to cure by\r\nreabsorbing the inflamed parts, or what is termed by resolution.\r\n\r\nM. M. Diluents, mucilage, antimonials, warmish air constantly changed,\r\nvenesection once, perhaps twice, if the pulse will bear it. Oily volatile\r\ndraughts. Balsams? Neutral salts increase the tendency to cough. Blisters\r\nin succession about the chest. Warm bath. Mild purgatives. Very weak\r\nchicken broth without salt in it. Boiled onions. One grain of calomel every\r\nnight for a week. From five drops to ten of tincture of opium at six every\r\nnight, when the patient becomes weak. Digitalis? See Class II. 1. 6. 7.\r\n\r\n8. _Pertussis._ Tussis convulsiva. Chin-cough resembles peripneumonia\r\nsuperficialis in its consisting in an inflammation of the membrane which\r\nlines the air-vessels of the lungs; but differs in the circumstance of its\r\nbeing contagious; and is on that account of very long duration; as the\r\nwhole of the lungs are probably not infected at the same time, but the\r\ncontagious inflammation continues gradually to creep on the membrane. It\r\nmay in this respect be compared to the ulcers in the pulmonary consumption;\r\nbut it differs in this, that in chin-cough some branches of the bronchia\r\nheal, as others become inflamed.\r\n\r\nThis complaint is not usually classed amongst febrile disorders, but a\r\nsensitive fever may generally be perceived to attend it during some part of\r\nthe day, especially in weak patients. And a peripneumony very frequently\r\nsupervenes, and destroys great numbers of children, except the lancet or\r\nfour or six leeches be immediately and repeatedly used. When the child has\r\npermanent difficulty of breathing, which continues between the coughing\r\nfits: unless blood be taken from it, it dies in two, three, or four days of\r\nthe inflammation of the lungs. During this permanent difficulty of\r\nbreathing the hooping-cough abates, or quite ceases, and returns again\r\nafter once or twice bleeding; which is then a good symptom, as the child\r\nnow possessing the power to cough shews the difficulty of breathing to be\r\nabated. I dwell longer upon this, because many lose their lives from the\r\ndifficulty there is in bleeding young children; where the apothecary is old\r\nor clumsy, or is not furnished with a very sharp and fine-pointed lancet.\r\nIn this distressing situation the application of four leeches to one of the\r\nchild's legs, the wounds made by which should continue to bleed an hour or\r\ntwo, is a succedaneum; and saves the patient, if repeated once or twice\r\naccording to the difficulty of the respiration.\r\n\r\nThe chin-cough seems to resemble the gonorrhoea venerea in several\r\ncircumstances. They are both received by infection, are both diseases of\r\nthe mucous membrane, are both generally cured in four or six weeks without\r\nmedicine. If ulcers in the cellular membrane under the mucous membrane\r\noccur, they are of a phagedenic kind, and destroy the patient in both\r\ndiseases, if no medicine be administered.\r\n\r\nHence the cure should be similar in both these diseases; first general\r\nevacuations and diluents, then, after a week or two, I have believed the\r\nfollowing pills of great advantage. The dose for a child of about three\r\nyears old was one sixth part of a grain of calomel, one sixth part of a\r\ngrain of opium, and two grains of rhubarb, to be taken twice a day.\r\n\r\nThe opium promotes absorption from the mucous membrane, and hence\r\ncontributes to heal it. The mercury prevents ulcers from being formed under\r\nthe mucous membrane, or cures them, as in the lues venerea; and the rhubarb\r\nis necessary to keep the bowels open.\r\n\r\nM. M. Antimonial vomits frequently repeated. Mild cathartics. Cool air.\r\nTincture of cantharides, or repeated blisters; afterwards opiates in small\r\ndoses, and the bark. Warm bath frequently used. The steam of warm water\r\nwith a little vinegar in it may be inhaled twice a day. Could the breathing\r\nof carbonic acid gas mixed with atmospheric air be of service? Copious\r\nvenesection, when a difficulty of breathing continues between the fits of\r\ncoughing; otherwise the cough and the expectoration cease, and the patient\r\nis destroyed. Ulcers of the lungs sometimes supervene, and the phthisis\r\npulmonalis in a few weeks terminates in death. Where the cough continues\r\nafter some weeks without much of the hooping, and a sensitive fever daily\r\nsupervenes, so as to resemble hectic fever from ulcers of the lungs; change\r\nof air for a week or fortnight acts as a charm, and restores the patient\r\nbeyond the hopes of the physician.\r\n\r\nYoung children should lie with their heads and shoulders raised; and should\r\nbe constantly watched day and night; that when the cough occurs, they may\r\nbe held up easily, so as to stand upon their feet bending a little\r\nforwards; or nicely supported in that posture which they seem to put\r\nthemselves into. A bow of whalebone, about the size of the bow of a key, is\r\nvery useful to extract the phlegm out of the mouths of infants at the time\r\nof their coughing; as an handkerchief, if applied at the time of their\r\nquick inspirations after long holding their breath, is dangerous, and may\r\nsuffocate the patient in an instant, as I believe has sometimes happened.\r\n\r\n9. _Variola discreta._ The small-pox is well divided by Sydenham into\r\ndistinct and confluent. The former consists of distinct pustules, which\r\nappear on the fourth day of the fever, are circumscribed and turgid; the\r\nfever ceasing when the eruption is complete. Head-ach, pain in the loins,\r\nvomiting frequently, and convulsive fits sometimes, precede the eruption.\r\n\r\nThe distinct small-pox is attended with sensitive fever only, when very\r\nmild, as in most inoculated patients; or with sensitive irritated fever,\r\nwhen the disease is greater: the danger in this kind of small-pox is owing\r\neither to the tumor and soreness of the throat about the height, or eighth\r\nday of the eruption; or to the violence of the secondary fever. For, first,\r\nas the natural disease is generally taken by particles of the dust of the\r\ncontagious matter dried and floating in the air, these are liable to be\r\narrested by the mucus about the throat and tonsils in their passage to the\r\nlungs, or to the stomach, when they are previously mixed with saliva in the\r\nmouth. Hence the throat inflames like the arm in inoculated patients; and\r\nthis increasing, as the disease advances, destroys the patient about the\r\nheight.\r\n\r\nSecondly, all those upon the face and head come out about the same time,\r\nnamely, about one day before those on the hands, and two before those in\r\nthe trunk; and thence, when the head is very full, a danger arises from the\r\nsecondary fever, which is a purulent, not a variolous fever; for as the\r\nmatter from all these of the face and head is reabsorbed at the same time,\r\nthe patient is destroyed by the violence of this purulent fever; which in\r\nthe distinct small-pox can only be abated by venesection and cathartics;\r\nbut in the confluent small-pox requires cordials and opiates, as it is\r\nattended with arterial debility. See Sect. XXXV. 1. and XXXIII. 2. 10.\r\n\r\nWhen the pustules on the face recede, the face swells; and when those of\r\nthe hands recede, the hands swell; and the same of the feet in succession.\r\nThese swellings seem to be owing to the absorption of variolous matter,\r\nwhich by its stimulus excites the cutaneous vessels to secrete more lymph,\r\nor serum, or mucus, exactly as happens by the stimulus of a blister. Now,\r\nas a blister sometimes produces strangury many hours after it has risen; it\r\nis plain, that a part of the cantharides is absorbed, and carried to the\r\nneck of the bladder; whether it enters the circulation, or is carried\r\nthither by retrograde movements of the urinary branch of lymphatics; and by\r\nparity of reasoning the variolous matter is absorbed, and swells the face\r\nand hands by its stimulus.\r\n\r\n_Variola confluens._ The confluent small-pox consists of numerous pustules,\r\nwhich appear on the third day of the fever, flow together, are irregularly\r\ncircumscribed, flaccid, and little elevated; the fever continuing after the\r\neruption is complete; convulsions do not precede this kind of small-pox,\r\nand are so far to be esteemed a favourable symptom.\r\n\r\nThe confluent small-pox is attended with sensitive inirritated fever, or\r\ninflammation with arterial debility; whence the danger of this disease is\r\nowing to the general tendency to gangrene, with petechiæ, or purple spots,\r\nand hæmorrhages; besides the two sources of danger from the tumor of the\r\nthroat about the height, or eleventh day of the eruption, and the purulent\r\nfever after that time; which are generally much more to be dreaded in this\r\nthan in the distinct small-pox described above.\r\n\r\nM. M. The method of treatment must vary with the degree and kind of fever.\r\nVenesection may be used in the distinct small-pox early in the disease,\r\naccording to the strength or hardness of the pulse; and perhaps on the\r\nfirst day of the confluent small-pox, and even of the plague, before the\r\nsensorial power is exhausted by the violence of the arterial action? Cold\r\nair, and even washing or bathing in cold water, is a powerful means in\r\nperhaps all eruptive diseases attended with fever; as the quantity of\r\neruption depends on the quantity of the fever, and the activity of the\r\ncutaneous vessels; which may be judged of by the heat produced on the skin;\r\nand which latter is immediately abated by exposure to external cold.\r\nMercurial purges, as three grains of calomel repeated every day during the\r\neruptive fever, so as to induce three or four stools, contribute to abate\r\ninflammation; and is believed by some to have a specific effect on the\r\nvariolous, as it is supposed to have on the venereal contagion.\r\n\r\nIt has been said, that opening the pock and taking out the matter has not\r\nabated the secondary fever; but as I had conceived, that the pits, or marks\r\nleft after the small-pox, were owing to the acrimony of the matter beneath\r\nthe hard scabs, which not being able to exhale eroded the skin, and\r\nproduced ulcers, I directed the faces of two patients in the confluent\r\nsmall-pox to be covered with cerate early in the disease, which was daily\r\nrenewed; and I was induced to think, that they had much less of the\r\nsecondary fever, and were so little marked, that one of them, who was a\r\nyoung lady, almost entirely preserved her beauty. Perhaps mercurial\r\nplasters, or cerates, made without turpentine in them, might have been more\r\nefficacious, in preventing the marks, and especially if applied early in\r\nthe disease, even on the first day of the eruption, and renewed daily. For\r\nit appears from the experiments of Van Woensel, that calomel or sublimate\r\ncorrosive, triturated with variolous matter, incapacitates it from giving\r\nthe disease by inoculation. Calomel or sublimate given as an alterative for\r\nten days before inoculation, and till the eruptive fever commences, is said\r\nwith certainty to render the disease mild by the same author. Exper. on\r\nMercury by Van Woensel, translated by Dr. Fowle, Salisbury.\r\n\r\n_Variola inoculata._ The world is much indebted to the great discoverer of\r\nthe good effects of inoculation, whose name is unknown; and our own country\r\nto Lady Wortley Montague for its introduction into this part of Europe. By\r\ninserting the variolous contagion into the arm, it is not received by the\r\ntonsils, as generally happens, I suppose, in the natural small-pox; whence\r\nthere is no dangerous swelling of the throat, and as the pustules are\r\ngenerally few and distinct, there is seldom any secondary fever; whence\r\nthose two sources of danger are precluded; hence when the throat in\r\ninoculated small-pox is much inflamed and swelled, there is reason to\r\nbelieve, that the disease had been previously taken by the tonsils in the\r\nnatural way.--Which also, I suppose, has generally happened, where the\r\nconfluent kind of small-pox has occurred on inoculation.\r\n\r\nI have known two instances, and have heard of others, where the natural\r\nsmall-pox began fourteen days after the contagion had been received; one of\r\nthese instances was of a countryman, who went to a market town many miles\r\nfrom his home, where he saw a person in the small-pox, and on returning the\r\nfever commenced that day fortnight: the other was of a child, whom the\r\nignorant mother carried to another child ill of the small-pox, on purpose\r\nto communicate the disease to it; and the variolous fever began on the\r\nfourteenth day from that time. So that in both these cases fever commenced\r\nin half a lunation after the contagion was received. In the inoculated\r\nsmall-pox the fever generally commences on the seventh day, or after a\r\nquarter of a lunation; and on this circumstance probably depends the\r\ngreater mildness of the latter. The reason of which is difficult to\r\ncomprehend; but supposing the facts to be generally as above related, the\r\nslower progress of the contagion indicates a greater inirritability of the\r\nsystem, and in consequence a tendency to malignant rather than to\r\ninflammatory fever. This difference of the time between the reception of\r\nthe infection and the fever in the natural and artificial small-pox may\r\nnevertheless depend on its being inserted into a different series of\r\nvessels; or to some unknown effect of lunar periods. It is a subject of\r\ngreat curiosity, and deserves further investigation.\r\n\r\nWhen the inoculated small-pox is given under all the most favourable\r\ncircumstances I believe less than one in a thousand miscarry, which may be\r\nascribed to some unavoidable accident, such as the patient having\r\npreviously received the infection, or being about to be ill of some other\r\ndisease. Those which have lately miscarried under inoculation, as far as\r\nhas come to my knowledge, have been chiefly children at the breast; for in\r\nthese the habit of living in the air has been confirmed by so short a time,\r\nthat it is much easier destroyed, than when these habits of life have been\r\nestablished by more frequent repetition. See Sect. XVII. 3. Thus it appears\r\nfrom the bills of mortality kept in the great cities of London, Paris, and\r\nVienna, that out of every thousand children above three hundred and fifty\r\ndie under two years old. (Kirkpatrick on Inoculation.) Whence a strong\r\nreason against our hazarding inoculation before that age is passed,\r\nespecially in crowded towns; except where the vicinity of the natural\r\ncontagion renders it necessary, or the convenience of inoculating a whole\r\nfamily at a time; as it then becomes better to venture the less favourable\r\ncircumstances of the age of the patient, or the chance of the pain from\r\ntoothing, than to risk the infection in the natural way.\r\n\r\nThe most favourable method consists in, first, for a week before\r\ninoculation, restraining the patients from all kinds of fermented or\r\nspirituous liquor, and from animal food; and by giving them from one grain\r\nto three or four of calomel every other day for three times. But if the\r\npatients be in any the least danger of taking the natural infection, the\r\ninoculation had better be immediately performed, and this abstinence then\r\nbegan; and two or three gentle purges with calomel should be given, one\r\nimmediately, and on alternate days. These cathartics should not induce more\r\nthan two or three stools. I have seen two instances of a confluent\r\nsmall-pox in inoculation following a violent purging induced by too large a\r\ndose of calomel.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the matter used for inoculation should be in a small quantity,\r\nand warm, and fluid. Hence it is best when it can be recently taken from a\r\npatient in the disease; or otherwise it may be diluted with part of a drop\r\nof warm water, since its fluidity is likely to occasion its immediate\r\nabsorption; and the wound should be made as small and superficial as\r\npossible, as otherwise ulcers have been supposed sometimes to ensue with\r\nsubaxillary abscesses. Add to this, that the making two punctures either on\r\nthe same, or one on each arm, secures the success of the operation in\r\nrespect to communicating the infection.\r\n\r\nThirdly, at the time of the fever or eruption the application of cool air\r\nto those parts of the skin, which are too warm, or appear red, or are\r\ncovered with what is termed a rash, should be used freely, as well as\r\nduring the whole disease. And at the same time, if the feet or hands are\r\ncolder than natural, these should be covered with flannel. See Class IV. 2.\r\n2. 10.\r\n\r\n10. _Rubeola irritata, morbilli._ The measles commence with sneezing, red\r\neyes, dry hoarse cough, and is attended with sensitive irritated fever. On\r\nthe fourth day, or a little later, small thick eruptions appear, scarcely\r\neminent above the skin, and, after three days, changing into very small\r\nbranny scales.\r\n\r\nAs the contagious material of the small-pox may be supposed to be diffused\r\nin the air like a fine dry powder, and mixing with the saliva in the mouth\r\nto infect the tonsils in its passage to the stomach; so the contagious\r\nmaterial of the measles may be supposed to be more completely dissolved in\r\nthe air, and thus to impart its poison to the membrane of the nostrils,\r\nwhich covers the sense of smell; whence a catarrh with sneezing ushers in\r\nthe fever; the termination of the nasal duct of the lacrymal sac is subject\r\nto the same stimulus and inflammation, and affects by sympathy the lacrymal\r\nglands, occasioning a great flow of tears. See Sect. XVI. 8. And the\r\nredness of the eye and eyelids is produced in consequence of the tears\r\nbeing in so great quantity, that the saline part of them is not entirely\r\nreabsorbed. See Sect. XXIV. 2. 8.\r\n\r\nThe contagion of the measles, if it be taken a sufficient time before\r\ninoculation, so that the eruption may commence before the variolous fever\r\ncomes on, stops the progress of the small-pox in the inoculated wound, and\r\ndelays it till the measle-fever has finished its career. See Sect. XXXIII.\r\n2. 9.\r\n\r\nThe measles are usually attended with inflammatory fever with strong pulse,\r\nand bear the lancet in every stage of the disease. In the early periods of\r\nit, venesection renders the fever and cough less; and, if any symptoms of\r\nperipneumony occur, is repeatedly necessary; and at the decline of the\r\ndisease, if a cough be left after the eruption has ceased, and the\r\nsubsequent branny scales are falling off, venesection should be immediately\r\nused; which prevents the danger of consumption. At this time also change of\r\nair is of material consequence, and often removes the cough like a charm,\r\nas mentioned in a similar situation at the end of the chin-cough.\r\n\r\n_Rubeola inirritata._ Measles with inirritated fever, or with weak pulse,\r\nhas been spoken of by some writers. See London Med. Observ. Vol. IV. Art.\r\nXI. It has also been said to have been attended with sore throat. Edinb.\r\nEssays, Vol. V. Art. II. Could the scarlet fever have been mistaken for the\r\nmeasles? or might one of them have succeeded the other, as in the measles\r\nand small-pox mentioned in Sect. XXXIII. 2. 9.?\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said, it is probable that inoculation might disarm the\r\nmeasles as much as the small-pox, by preventing the catarrh, and frequent\r\npulmonary inflammation, which attends this disease; both of which are\r\nprobably the consequence of the immediate application of the contagious\r\nmiasmata to these membranes. Some attempts have been made, but a difficulty\r\nseems to arise in giving the disease; the blood, I conjecture, would not\r\ninfect, nor the tears; perhaps the mucous discharge from the nostrils might\r\nsucceed; or a drop of warm water put on the eruptions, and scraped off\r\nagain with the edge of a lancet; or if the branny scales were collected,\r\nand moistened with a little warm water? Further experiments on this subject\r\nwould be worthy the public attention.\r\n\r\n11. _Scarlatina mitis._ The scarlet fever exists with all degrees of\r\nvirulence, from a flea-bite to the plague. The infectious material of this\r\ndisease, like that of the small-pox, I suppose to be diffused, not\r\ndissolved, in the air; on which account I suspect, that it requires a much\r\nnearer approach to the sick, for a well person to receive the infection,\r\nthan in the measles; the contagion of which I believe to be more volatile,\r\nor diffusible in the atmosphere. But as the contagious miasmata of\r\nsmall-pox and scarlet fever are supposed to be more fixed, they may remain\r\nfor a longer time in clothes or furniture; as a thread dipped in variolous\r\nmatter has given the disease by inoculation after having been exposed many\r\ndays to the air, and after having been kept many months in a phial. This\r\nalso accounts for the slow or sporadic progress of the scarlet fever, as it\r\ninfects others at but a very small distance from the sick; and does not\r\nproduce a quantity of pus-like matter, like the small-pox, which can adhere\r\nto the clothes of the attendants, and when dried is liable to be shook off\r\nin the form of powder, and thus propagate the infection.\r\n\r\nThis contagious powder of the small-pox, and of the scarlet fever, becomes\r\nmixed with saliva in the mouth, and is thus carried to the tonsils, the\r\nmucus of which arrests some particles of this deleterious material; while\r\nother parts of it are carried into the stomach, and are probably decomposed\r\nby the power of digestion; as seems to happen to the venom of the viper,\r\nwhen taken into the stomach. Our perception of bad tastes in our mouths, at\r\nthe same time that we perceive disagreeable odours to our nostrils, when we\r\ninhale very bad air, occasions us to spit out our saliva; and thus, in some\r\ninstances, to preserve ourselves from infection. This has been supposed to\r\noriginate from the sympathy between the organs of taste and smell; but any\r\none who goes into a sick room close shut up, or into a crowded\r\nassembly-room, or tea-room, which is not sufficiently ventilated, may\r\neasily mix the bad air with the saliva on his tongue so as to taste it; as\r\nI have myself frequently attended to.\r\n\r\nHence it appears that these heavy infectious matters are more liable to mix\r\nwith the saliva, and inflame the tonsils, and that either before or at the\r\ncommencement of the fever; and this is what generally happens in the\r\nscarlet fever, always I suppose in the malignant kind, and very frequently\r\nin the mild kind. But as this infection may be taken by other means, as by\r\nthe skin, it also happens in the most mild kind, that there is no\r\ninflammation of the tonsils at all; in the same manner as there is\r\ngenerally no inflammation of the tonsils in the inoculated small-pox.\r\n\r\nIn the mild scarlatina on the fourth day of the fever the face swells a\r\nlittle, at the same time a florid redness appears on various parts of the\r\nskin, in large blotches, at length coalescing, and after three days\r\nchanging into branny scales.\r\n\r\nM. M. Cool air. Fruit. Lemonade. Milk and water.\r\n\r\n_Scarlatina maligna._ The malignant scarlet fever begins with inflamed\r\ntonsils; which are succeeded by dark drab coloured sloughs three or five\r\nlines in diameter, flat, or beneath the surrounding surface; and which\r\nconceal beneath them spreading gangrenous ulcers. The swellings of the\r\ntonsils are sensible to the eye and touch externally, and have an elastic\r\nrather than an oedematous feel, like parts in the vicinity of gangrenes.\r\nThe pulse is very quick and weak, with delirium, and the patient generally\r\ndies in a few days; or if he recovers, it is by slow degrees, and attended\r\nwith anasarca.\r\n\r\nM. M. A vomit once. Wine. Beer. Cyder. Opium. Bark; in small repeated\r\ndoses. Small successive blisters, if the extremities are cooler than\r\nnatural. Cool air on the hot parts of the skin, the cool extremities being\r\nat the same time covered. Iced lemonade. Broth. Custards. Milk. Jellies.\r\nBread pudding. Chicken. Touch the ulcers with a dry sponge to absorb the\r\ncontagious matter, and then with a sponge filled with vinegar, with or\r\nwithout sugar of lead dissolved in it, about six grains to an ounce; or\r\nwith a very little blue vitriol dissolved in it, as a grain to an ounce;\r\nbut nothing so instantaneously corrects the putrid smell of ulcers as a\r\nsolution of alum; about half an ounce to a pint of water, which should be a\r\nlittle warmish, and injected into the fauces gently by means of a syringe.\r\nThese should be repeated frequently in a day, if it can be done easily, and\r\nwithout fatigue to the child. A little powder of bark taken frequently into\r\nthe mouth, as a grain or two, that it may mix with the saliva, and thus\r\nfrequently stimulate the dying tonsils. Could a warm bath made of decoction\r\nof bark, or a cold fomentation with it, be of service? Could oxygene gas\r\nmixed with common air stimulate the languid system? Small electric shocks\r\nthrough the tonsils every hour? ether frequently applied externally to the\r\nswelled tonsils?\r\n\r\nAs this disease is attended with the greatest degree of debility, and as\r\nstimulant medicines, if given in quantity, so as to produce more than\r\nnatural warmth, contribute to expend the already too much exhausted\r\nsensorial power; it appears, that there is nothing so necessary to be\r\nnicely attended to, as to prevent any unnecessary motions of the system;\r\nthis is best accomplished by the application of cold to those parts of the\r\nskin, which are in the least too hot. And secondly, that the exhibition of\r\nthe bark in such quantity, as not to oppress the stomach and injure\r\ndigestion, is next to be attended to, as not being liable to increase the\r\nactions of the system beyond their natural quantity; and that opium and\r\nwine should be given with the greatest caution, in very small repeated\r\nquantity, and so managed as to prevent, if possible, the cold fits of\r\nfever; which probably occur twice in 25 hours, obeying the lunations like\r\nthe tides, as mentioned in Sect. XXXII. 6. that is, I suppose, the cold\r\nperiods, and consequent exacerbations of fever, in this malignant\r\nscarlatina, occur twice in a lunar day; which is about ten minutes less\r\nthan 25 hours; so that if the commencement of one cold fit be marked, the\r\ncommencement of the next may be expected, if not disturbed by the\r\nexhibition of wine or opium, or the application of blisters, to occur in\r\nabout twelve hours and a half from the commencement of the former; or if\r\nnot prevented by large doses of the bark.\r\n\r\nNo one could do an act more beneficial to society, or glorious to himself,\r\nthan by teaching mankind how to inoculate this fatal disease; and thus to\r\ndeprive it of its malignity. Matter might be taken from the ulcers in the\r\nthroat, which would probably convey the contagion. Or warm water might be\r\nput on the eruption, and scraped off again by the edge of a lancet. These\r\nexperiments could be attended with no danger, and should be tried for the\r\npublic benefit, and the honour of medical science.\r\n\r\n12. _Miliaria._ Miliary fever. An eruption produced by the warmth, and more\r\nparticularly by the stimulus of the points of the wool in flannel or\r\nblankets applied to the skin, has been frequently observed; which, by cool\r\ndress, and bed-clothes without flannel, has soon ceased. See Class I. 1. 2.\r\n3. This, which maybe called _miliaria sudatoria_, has been confounded with\r\nother miliary fevers, and has made the existence of the latter doubted. Two\r\nkinds of eruptions I have seen formerly attended with fever, but did not\r\nsufficiently mark their progress, which I conceived to be miliary\r\neruptions, one with arterial strength, or with sensitive irritated fever,\r\nand the other with arterial debility, or with sensitive inirritated fever.\r\n\r\nIn the former of these, or _miliaria irritata_, the eruptions were distinct\r\nand larger than the small-pox, and the fever was not subdued without two or\r\nthree venesections, and repeated cathartics with calomel.\r\n\r\nThe latter, or _miliaria inirritata_, was attended with great arterial\r\ndebility; and during the course of the fever pellucid points appeared\r\nwithin the skin, particularly on the soft parts of the fingers. And, in one\r\npatient, whom I esteemed near her end, I well recollect to have observed\r\nround pellucid globules, like what are often seen on vines in hot-houses,\r\nno larger than the smallest pins' heads, adhere to her neck and bosom;\r\nwhich were hard to the touch, but were easily rubbed off. These diseases,\r\nif they are allied, do not differ more than the kinds of small-pox; but\r\nrequire many further observations.\r\n\r\nThe eruption so often seen on children in the cradle, and called by the\r\nnurses red-gum, and which is attended with some degree of fever, I suspect\r\nto be produced by too great warmth, and the contact of flannel next their\r\ntender skins, like the miliaria sudatoria; and like that requires cool air,\r\ncool clothes, and linen next their skin.\r\n\r\n13. _Pestis._ The plague, like other diseases of this class, seems to be\r\nsometimes mild, and sometimes malignant; according to the testimony of\r\ndifferent writers. It is said to be attended with inflammation, with the\r\ngreatest arterial debility, and to be very contagious, attended at an\r\nuncertain time of the fever with buboes and carbuncles. Some authors\r\naffirm, that the contagion of the plague may be repeatedly received, so as\r\nto produce the disease; but as this is contrary to the general analogy of\r\nall contagious diseases, which are attended with fever, and which cure\r\nthemselves spontaneously; there is reason to suspect, that where it has\r\nbeen supposed to have been repeatedly received, that some other fever with\r\narterial debility has been mistaken for it, as has probably universally\r\nbeen the case, when the small-pox has been said to have been twice\r\nexperienced.\r\n\r\nM. M. Venesection has been recommended by some writers on the first day,\r\nwhere the inflammation was supposed to be attended with sufficient arterial\r\nstrength, which might perhaps sometimes happen, as the bubo seems to be a\r\nsuppuration; but the carbuncle, or anthrax, is a gangrene of the part, and\r\nshews the greatest debility of circulation. Whence all the means before\r\nenumerated in this genus of diseases to support the powers of life are to\r\nbe administered. Currents of cold air, cold water, ice, externally on the\r\nhot parts of the skin.\r\n\r\nThe methods of preventing the spreading of this disease have been much\r\ncanvassed, and seem to consist in preventing all congregations of the\r\npeople, as in churches, or play-houses; and to remove the sick into tents\r\non some airy common by the side of a river, and supply them with fresh\r\nfood, both animal and vegetable, with beer and wine in proper quantities,\r\nand to encourage those who can, daily to wash both their clothes and\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThe _pestis vaccina_, or disease amongst the cows, which afflicted this\r\nisland about half a century ago, seems to have been a contagious fever with\r\ngreat arterial debility; as in some of them in the latter stage of the\r\ndisease, an emphysema could often be felt in some parts, which evinced a\r\nconsiderable progress of gangrene beneath the skin. In the sensitive\r\ninirritated fevers of these animals, I suppose about sixty grains of opium,\r\nwith two ounces of extract of oak-bark, every six hours, would supply them\r\nwith an efficacious medicine; to which might be added thirty grains of\r\nvitriol of iron, if any tendency to bloody urine should appear, to which\r\nthis animal is liable. The method of preventing the infection from\r\nspreading, if it should ever again gain access to this island, would be\r\nimmediately to obtain an order from government to prevent any cattle from\r\nbeing removed, which were found within five miles of the place supposed to\r\nbe infected, for a few days; till the certainty of the existence of the\r\npestilence could be ascertained, by a committee of medical people. As soon\r\nas this was ascertained, all the cattle within five miles of the place\r\nshould be immediately slaughtered, and consumed within the circumscribed\r\ndistrict; and their hides put into lime-water before proper inspectors.\r\n\r\n14. _Pemphigus_ is a contagious disease attended with bladdery eruptions\r\nappearing on the second or third day, as large as filberts, which, remain\r\nmany days, and then effuse a thin ichor. It seems to be either of a mild\r\nkind with sensitive fever only, of which I have seen two instances, or with\r\nirritated, or with inirritated fever, as appears from the observations of\r\nM. Salabert. See Medical Comment, by Dr. Duncan, Decad. II. Vol. VI.\r\n\r\n15. _Varicella._ Chicken-pox is accompanied with sensitive fever, pustules\r\nbreak out after a mild fever like the small-pox, seldom suppurate, and\r\ngenerally terminate in scales without scars. I once saw a lady, who\r\nmiscarryed during this disease, though all her children had it as slightly\r\nas usual. It sometimes leaves scars or marks on the skin. This disease has\r\nbeen mistaken for the small-pox, and inoculated for it; and then the\r\nsmall-pox has been supposed to happen twice to the same person. See Trans.\r\nof the College London. It is probable that the pemphigus and urticaria, as\r\nwell as this disease, have formerly been diseases of more danger; which the\r\nhabit of innumerable generations may have rendered mild, and will in\r\nprocess of time annihilate. In the same manner as the small-pox, venereal\r\ndisease, and rickets, seem to become milder or less in quantity every half\r\ncentury. While at the same time it is not improbable, that other new\r\ndiseases may arise, and for a season thin mankind!\r\n\r\n16. _Urticaria._ Nettle-rash begins with mild sensitive fever, which is\r\nsometimes scarcely perceptible. Hence this eruption has been thought of two\r\nsorts, one with and the other without fever. On the second day red spots,\r\nlike parts stung with nettles, are seen; which almost vanish during the\r\nday, and recur in the evening with the fever, succeeded in a few days by\r\nvery minute scales. See Trans. of the College, London.\r\n\r\n17. _Aphtha._ Thrush. It has been doubted, whether aphtha or thrush, which\r\nconsists of ulcers in the mouth, should be enumerated amongst febrile\r\ndiseases; and whether these ulcers are always symptomatic, or the\r\nconsequence rather than the cause of the fevers which attend them. The\r\ntongue becomes rather swelled; its colour and that of the fauces purplish;\r\nsloughs or ulcers appear first on the throat and edges of the tongue, and\r\nat length over the whole mouth. These sloughs are whitish, sometimes\r\ndistinct, often coalescing, and remain an uncertain time. Cullen. I shall\r\nconcisely mention four cases of aphtha, but do not pretend to determine\r\nwhether they were all of them symptomatic or original diseases.\r\n\r\n_Aphtha sensitiva._ A lady during pregnancy was frequently seized with\r\nulcers on her tongue and cheeks, or other parts of the mouth, without much\r\napparent fever; which continued two or three weeks, and returned almost\r\nevery month. The thrush in the mouths of young children seems to be a\r\nsimilar disease. These ulcers resemble those produced in the sea-scurvy,\r\nand have probably for their cause an increased action of the secerning\r\nsystem from increased sensation, with a decreased action of the absorbent\r\nsystem from decreased irritation. See Class I. 2. 1. 15.\r\n\r\nM. M. Solutions of alum, of blue vitriol. Powder of bark taken frequently\r\ninto the mouth in very small quantity. See Class II. 1. 3. 1.\r\n\r\n_Aphtha irritata._ Inflammatory aphtha. A case of this kind is related\r\nunder the title of suppurative rheumatism. Class IV. 1. 2. 16.\r\n\r\n_Aphtha inirritata._ Sloughs or ulcers of the mouth, attended with\r\nsensitive fever with great arterial debility. They seem to spread downwards\r\nfrom the throat into the stomach, and probably through the whole intestinal\r\ncanal, beginning their course with cardialgia, and terminating it with\r\ntenesmus; and might perhaps be called an erysipelas of this mucous\r\nmembrane.\r\n\r\nM. M. Cool air. A small blister on the back. Bark. Wine. Opium in small\r\nrepeated quantities. Soap neutralizes the gastric acid without\r\neffervescence, and thus relieves the pain of cardialgia, where the stomach\r\nis affected. Milk also destroys a part of this acid. Infusion of sage\r\nleaves two ounces, almond soap from five grains to ten, with sugar and\r\ncream, is generally both agreeable and useful to these patients. See I. 2.\r\n4. 5.\r\n\r\nWhere the stomach may be supposed to be excoriated by poisons containing\r\nacid, as sublimate of mercury or arsenic; or if it be otherwise inflamed,\r\nor very sensible to the stimulus of the gastric acid; or where it abounds\r\nwith acid of any kind, as in cardialgia; the exhibition of soap is perhaps\r\na preferable manner of giving alcali than any other, as it decomposes in\r\nthe stomach without effervescence; while the caustic alcali is too acrid to\r\nbe administered in such cases, and the mild alcali produces carbonic gas.\r\nIf a drop of acid of vitriol be put on cap paper, it will be long before it\r\ndestroys the paper; but if a drop of mild alcali be added, a sudden\r\neffervescence arises, and the paper is instantly destroyed by the escape of\r\nthe fixed air; in the same manner as lumps of solid lime are broken into\r\npowder by the escape of the steam produced from the water, which is poured\r\non them. This shews why a succession of acid and of alcaline caustics\r\nsooner destroys a part, than either of them applied separately.\r\n\r\n18. _Dysenteria._ Bloody-flux is attended with sensitive fever generally\r\nwith arterial debility; with frequent mucous or bloody stools; which\r\ncontain contagious matter produced by the membranes of the intestines; the\r\nalimentary excrement being nevertheless retained; with griping pains and\r\ntenesmus.\r\n\r\nM. M. Emetics. Antimonials. Peruvian bark. Opium and calomel of each a\r\ngrain every night. Bolus armeniæ. Earth of alum. Chalk. Calcined hartshorn.\r\nMucilage. Bee's wax mixt with yolk of egg. Cerated glass of antimony. Warm\r\nbath. Flannel clothing next to the skin. Large clysters with opium. With\r\nipecacuanha, with smoke of tobacco? Two dysenteric patients in the same\r\nward of the infirmary at Edinburgh quarrelled, and whipped each other with\r\nhorsewhips a long time, and were both much better after it, owing perhaps\r\nto the exertion of so much of the sensorial power of volition; which, like\r\nreal insanity, added excitement to the whole system.\r\n\r\nThe prevention of this contagion must consist principally in ventilation\r\nand cleanliness; hence the patients should be removed into cottages distant\r\nfrom each other, or into tents; and their fæces buried as soon as may be;\r\nor conveyed into a running stream; and themselves should be washed with\r\ncold or warm water after every evacuation. For the contagious matter\r\nconsists in the mucous or purulent discharge from the membrane which lines\r\nthe intestines; and not from the febrile perspiration, or breath of the\r\npatients. For the fever is only the consequence and not the cause of\r\ncontagion; as appears from Genus the Fifth of this Order, where contagion\r\nexists without fever.\r\n\r\n19. _Gastritis superficialis._ Superficial inflammation of the stomach. An\r\nerysipelatous inflammation of the stomach is mentioned by Dr. Cullen from\r\nhis own observations; which is distinguished from the inflammatory\r\ngastritis by less pain, and fever, and by an erysipelatous redness about\r\nthe fauces. Does this disease belong to aphtha?\r\n\r\n20. _Enteritis superficialis._ Superficial inflammation of the bowels is\r\nalso mentioned by Dr. Cullen from his own observation under the name of\r\nenteritis erythematica; and is said to be attended with less pain and\r\nfever, without vomiting, and with diarrhoea. May not this disease be\r\nreferred to aphtha, or to dysentery?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nORDO I.\r\n\r\n_Increased Sensation._\r\n\r\nGENUS IV.\r\n\r\n_With the Production of new Vessels by internal Membranes or Glands,\r\nwithout Fever._\r\n\r\nWhere inflammation is produced in a small part, which has not great natural\r\nsensibility, the additional sensation does not produce an increased action\r\nof the arterial system; that is, the associated motions which are employed\r\nin the circulation of the blood, those for instance of the heart, arteries,\r\nglands, capillaries, and their correspondent veins, are not thrown into\r\nincreased action by so small an addition of the sensorial power of\r\nsensation. But when parts, which naturally possess more sensibility, become\r\ninflamed, the quantity of the sensorial power of sensation becomes so much\r\nincreased, as to affect the associated motions belonging to the\r\ncirculation, occasioning them to proceed with greater frequency; that is, a\r\nfever is induced. This is well exemplified in the internal and superficial\r\nparonychia, one of which is attended with great pain and fever, and the\r\nother with little pain and no fever. See Class II. 1. 2. 19. and II. 1. 4.\r\n5.\r\n\r\nFrom hence it appears, that the sensitive fever is an accidental\r\nconsequence of the topical phlegmon, or inflammation, and not a cause of\r\nit; that it is often injurious, but never salutary; and should therefore\r\nalways be extinguished, as soon as may be, either by the lancet and\r\ncathartics, and diluents, and cold air, when it is of the irritated kind;\r\nor by the bark, opium, cool air, and nutrientia, when it is of the\r\ninirritated kind.\r\n\r\nSPECIES.\r\n\r\n1. _Ophthalmia superficialis._ As the membranes, which cover the eye, are\r\nexcluded from the air about one third part of the twenty-four hours; and\r\nare moistened by perpetual nictitation during the other sixteen; they may\r\nbe considered as internal membranes; and from the analogy of their\r\ninflammation to that of other internal membranes, it is arranged under this\r\ngenus; whilst the tonsillitis is esteemed an inflammation of an external\r\nmembrane, because currents of air are perpetually passing both day and\r\nnight over the fauces.\r\n\r\nThe superficial ophthalmy has generally been esteemed a symptom of\r\nscrophula, when it recurs frequently in young persons; but is probably only\r\na concomitant of that disease, as a symptom of general debility;\r\nramifications of new red vessels, and of enlarged old ones, are spread over\r\nthe white part of the eye; and it is attended with less heat, less pain,\r\nand less intolerance of light than the ophthalmia interna, described in\r\nClass II. 1. 2. 2. It occurs in those of feeble circulation, especially\r\nchildren of a scrophulous tendency, and seems to arise from a previous\r\ntorpor of the vessels of the tunica albuginea from their being exposed to\r\ncold air; and from this torpor being more liable to occur in habits, which\r\nare naturally inirritable; and therefore more readily fall into quiescence\r\nby a smaller deduction of the stimulus of heat, than would affect stronger\r\nor more irritable habits; the consequence of this torpor is increased\r\naction, which produces pain in the eye, and that induces inflammation by\r\nthe acquisition of the additional sensorial power of sensation.\r\n\r\n_Ophthalmia lymphatica_ is a kind of anasarca of the tunica adnata; in this\r\nthe vessels over the sclerotica, or white part of the eye, rise\r\nconsiderably above the cornea, which they surround, are less red than in\r\nthe ophthalmia superficialis, and appear to be swelled by an accumulation\r\nof lymph rather than of blood; it is probably owing to the temporary\r\nobstruction of a branch of the lymphatic system.\r\n\r\nM. M. If the pain be great, venesection by leeches on the temple, or\r\ncutting the temporal artery, and one purge with three or four grains of\r\ncalomel should be premised. Then the Peruvian bark twice a day. Opium from\r\na quarter to half a grain twice a day for some weeks. Bathe the eye\r\nfrequently with cold water alone, or with cold water, to a pint of which is\r\nadded half an ounce of salt. White vitriol six grains dissolved in one\r\nounce of water; a drop or two to be put between the eyelids twice a day.\r\nTake very small electric sparks from the eyes every day for a fortnight.\r\nBathe the whole head with salt and water made warm every night for some\r\nmonths. Send such children to a school near the sea for the convenience of\r\nsea-bathing for many months annually; such schools are to be found in or\r\nnear Liverpool.\r\n\r\nWhen a child is afflicted with an inflamed eye of this kind, he should\r\nalways sit with his back to the window or candle; but it is generally not\r\nnecessary to cover it, or if the uneasy sensation of light makes this\r\nproper, the cover should stand off from the eye, so as not much to exclude\r\nthe cool air from it. As covering an eye unnecessarily is liable to make\r\nthat eye weaker than the other, from its not being sufficiently used, and\r\nthence to produce a squinting for ever afterwards.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, when the pain is great, a poultice must be applied to keep\r\nthe eyes moist, or a piece of oiled silk bound lightly over them. Or thus,\r\nboil an egg till it is hard, cut it longitudinally into two hemispheres,\r\ntake out the yolk, sew the backs of the two hollow hemispheres of the white\r\nto a ribbon, and bind them over the eyes every night on going to bed;\r\nwhich, if nicely fitted on, will keep the eyes moist without any\r\ndisagreeable pressure. See Class I. 1. 3. 14.\r\n\r\n_Ophthalmia equina._ An inflammation of this kind is liable to affect the\r\neyes of horses; one cause of which is owing to a silly custom of cutting\r\nthe hair out of horses' ears; by which they are not only liable to take\r\ncold at the ear, but grass seeds are liable to fall into their ears from\r\nthe high racks in stables; and in both cases the eye becomes inflamed by\r\nsympathy. I once directed the temporal artery of a horse to be opened, who\r\nhad frequent returns of an inflamed eye; and I believed it was of essential\r\nservice to him; it is probable that the artery was afterwards contracted in\r\nthe wounded part, and that thence less blood was derived to the eye: the\r\nhæmorrhage was stopped by two persons alternately keeping their fingers on\r\nthe orifice, and afterwards by a long bandage of broad tape.\r\n\r\n2. _Pterigion._ Eye-wing. A spot of inflammation sometimes begins on the\r\ninside of the lower eyelid, or on the tunica albuginea, and spreads an\r\nintertexture of red vessels from it, as from a center, which extend on the\r\nwhite part of the eye, and have the appearance of the wing of a fly, from\r\nwhence its name.\r\n\r\nM. M. Cut the ramifications of vessels again and again with the point of a\r\nlancet close to the center of inflammation.\r\n\r\n3. _Tarsitis palpebrarum._ Inflammation of the edges of the eyelids. This\r\nis a disease of the glands, which produce the hairs of the eye-lashes, and\r\nis frequently the cause of their falling off. After this inflammation a\r\nhard scar-like ridge is left on the edge of the eyelid, which scratches and\r\ninflames the eyeball, and becomes a very troublesome disease.\r\n\r\nThe Turkish ladies are said to colour the edge of the eyelash with crude\r\nantimony in very fine powder, which not only gives lustre to the eye, as a\r\ndiamond set on a black soil, but may prevent extraneous light from being\r\nreflected from these edges into the eye, and thus serve the purpose of the\r\nblack feathers about the eyes of swans, described in Sect. XXXIX. 5. 1. and\r\nmay also prevent the edges of the eyelids from being inflamed by the\r\nfrequent stimulus of tears on them. Black lead in fine powder might be\r\nbetter for all these purposes than antimony, and might be put on with a\r\ncamel's hair brush.\r\n\r\nM. M. Mercurial ointment smeared at night on the edges of the eyelids.\r\nBurnt alum sixty grains, hog's grease half an ounce, well rubbed into an\r\nointment to be smeared on them in the night. Cold water frequently in the\r\nday. See Class II. 1. 1. 8.\r\n\r\n4. _Hordeolum._ Stye. This inflammation begins either on or near the edges\r\nof the eyelids, or in the loose skin of them, and is sometimes very slow\r\neither in coming to suppuration or in dispersing. The skin beneath the\r\nlower eyelid is the most frequent seat of this tumor, which sometimes never\r\nsuppurates at all, but becomes an incysted tumor: for as this skin is very\r\nloose for the purpose of admitting great motion to the eyelid, the\r\nabsorbent power of the veins seems particularly weak in this part; whence\r\nwhen any person is weakened by fatigue or otherwise, a darker shade of\r\ncolour is seen beneath the eyes; which is owing to a less energetic action\r\nof the absorbent terminations of the veins, whence the currents of dark or\r\nvenous blood are delayed in them. This dark shade beneath the eyes, when it\r\nis permanent, is a symptom of habitual debility, or inirritability of the\r\ncirculating system. See Class I. 2. 2. 2.\r\n\r\nM. M. Smear the tumors with mercurial ointment, moisten them frequently\r\nwith ether. To promote their suppuration they may be wounded with a lancet,\r\nor slit down the middle, or they may be cut out. A caustic leaves a large\r\nscar.\r\n\r\n5. _Paronychia superficialis._ Whitlow. An inflammation about the roots of\r\nthe nail beneath the skin, which suppurates without fever, and sometimes\r\ndestroys the nail; which is however gradually reproduced. This kind of\r\nabscess, though not itself dangerous, has given opportunity for the\r\ninoculation of venereal matter in the hands of accoucheurs, and of putrid\r\nmatter from the dissection of diseased bodies; and has thus been the cause\r\nof disease and death. When putrid matter has been thus absorbed from a dead\r\nbody, a livid line from the finger to the swelled gland in the axilla is\r\nsaid to be visible; which shews the inflammation of the absorbent vessel\r\nalong its whole course to the lymphatic gland; and death has generally been\r\nthe consequence.\r\n\r\nM. M. In the common paronychia a poultice is generally sufficient. In the\r\nabsorption of putrid matter rub the whole hand and arm with mercurial\r\nointment three or four times a day, or perpetually. Could the swelled\r\naxillary gland be exsected? In the absorption of venereal matter the usual\r\nmethods of cure in syphilis must be administered, as in Class II. 1. 5. 2.\r\n\r\n6. _Gutta rosea._ The rosy drop on the face is of three kinds. First, the\r\n_gutta rosea hepatica_, or the red pimples on the faces of drunkards, which\r\nare probably a kind of crisis, or vicarious inflammation, which succeeds,\r\nor prevents, a torpor of the membranes of the liver. This and the\r\nsucceeding species properly belong to Class IV. 1. 2. 14.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the pimpled face in consequence of drinking cold water, or eating\r\ncold turnips, or other insipid food, when much heated with exercise; which\r\nprobably arises from the sympathy between the skin of the face and the\r\nstomach; and may be called the _gutta rosea stomatica_. Which is\r\ndistinguished from the former by the habits of the patient in respect to\r\ndrinking; by the colour of the eruptions being less deep; and by the\r\npatient continuing generally to be troubled with some degree of apepsia.\r\nSee Class I. 3. 1. 3. I knew a lady, who had long been afflicted with pain\r\nabout the region of the stomach; and, on drinking half a pint of vinegar,\r\nas a medicine, she had a breaking out commenced on her face; which\r\nremained, and she became free from the pain about the stomach. Was this a\r\nstomachic, or an hepatic disease?\r\n\r\nThirdly, there is a red face, which consists of smaller pimples than those\r\nabove mentioned; and which is less liable to suppurate; and which seems to\r\nbe hereditary, or at least has no apparent cause like those above\r\nmentioned; which may be termed _gutta rosea hereditaria_, or puncta rosea.\r\n\r\nMrs. S. had a pimpled face, which I believe arose from potation of ale. She\r\napplied alum in a poultice to it, and had soon a paralytic stroke, which\r\ndisabled her on one side, and terminated in her death.\r\n\r\nMrs. L. had a red pimpled face, which seemed to have been derived from her\r\nmother, who had probably acquired it by vinous potation; she applied a\r\nquack remedy to it, which I believe was a solution of lead, and was seized\r\nwith epileptic fits, which terminated in palsy, and destroyed her. This\r\nshews the danger of using white paint on the face, which is called bismuth,\r\nbut is in reality white lead or cerussa.\r\n\r\nMr. Y---- had acquired the gutta rosea on his nose, and applied a saturnine\r\nsolution on it for a few nights, and was then seized with paralysis on one\r\nside of his face; which however he gradually recovered, and has since\r\nacquired the gutta rosea on other parts of his face.\r\n\r\nThese fatal effects were probably caused by the disagreeable sensation of\r\nan inflamed liver, which used before to be relieved of the sympathetic\r\naction and consequent inflammation of the skin of the face, which was now\r\nprevented by the stronger stimulus of the application of calx of lead. The\r\nmanner in which disagreeable sensations induce epilepsy and palsy is\r\ntreated of in Class III. In some cases where habitual discharges, or\r\neruptions, or ulcers are stopped, a torpor of the system may follow, owing\r\nto the want of the accustomed quantity of sensation or irritation. See\r\nClass I. 1. 2. 9. and II. 1. 5. 6. In both these situations some other\r\nstimulus should be used to supply the place of that which is taken away;\r\nwhich may either be perpetual, as an issue; or periodical, as a cathartic\r\nrepeated once a fortnight or month.\r\n\r\nMiss W. an elegant young lady of about twenty, applied a mercurial lotion\r\nto her face, which was covered with very small red points; which seemed to\r\nhave been not acquired by any known or avoidable means; she was seized with\r\ninflammation of her liver, and after repeated bleeding and cathartics\r\nrecovered, and in a few weeks the eruption appeared as before.\r\n\r\nM. M. Five grains of calomel once a month, with a cathartic, five grains of\r\nrhubarb and a quarter of a grain of emetic tartar every night for many\r\nweeks. With this preparation mercurial plasters, made without turpentine,\r\nand applied every night, and taken off every morning, will sometimes\r\nsucceed, and may be used with safety. But blistering the face all over the\r\neruption, beginning with a part, succeeds better than any other means, as I\r\nhave more than once experienced.--Something like this is mentioned in the\r\nLetters of Lady Mary Wortley Montague, who blistered her face with balsam\r\nof Mecca.\r\n\r\nMrs. F. had for many years had a disagreeably looking eruption on her chin,\r\nafter a cathartic with calomel, she was advised to blister her whole chin;\r\non the healing of the blister a few eruptions again appeared, which ceased\r\non the application of a second blister. She took rhubarb five grains, and\r\nemetic tartar a quarter of a grain every night for many weeks.\r\n\r\nMiss L. a young lady about eighteen, had tried variety of advice for\r\npimples over the greatest part of her face in vain. She took the above\r\nmedicines internally, and blistered her face by degrees all over and became\r\nquite beautiful. A spot or two now and then appeared, and on this account\r\nshe frequently slept with parts of her face covered with mercurial plaster,\r\nmade without turpentine, which was held on by a pasteboard mask, and taken\r\noff in the mornings; if any part of the plaster adhered, a little butter or\r\noil destroyed the adhesion.\r\n\r\n7. _Odontitis._ Inflammatory tooth-ach is occasioned by inflammation of the\r\nmembranes of the tooth, or a caries of the bone itself. The gum sometimes\r\nsuppurates, otherwise a swelling of the cheek succeeds by association, and\r\nthus the violence of the pain in the membranes of the tooth is relieved,\r\nand frequently cured; and when this happens the disease properly belongs to\r\nClass IV. as it so far resembles the translations of morbid actions in the\r\ngout and rheumatism.\r\n\r\nAt other times the tooth dies without caries, especially in people about\r\nsixty years of age, or before; and then it stimulates its involving\r\nmembrane, like any other extraneous substance. The membrane then becomes\r\ninflamed and thickened, occasioning some pain, and the tooth rises upwards\r\nabove the rest, and is gradually pushed out whole and undecayed; on its\r\nrising up a pus-like mucus is seen discharged from the gum, which surrounds\r\nit; and the gum seems to have left the tooth, as the fangs or roots of it\r\nare in part naked.\r\n\r\nM. M. Where the tooth is sound it can only be saved by evacuations by\r\nvenesection, and a cathartic; and after its operation two grains of opium,\r\na blister may also be used behind the ear, and ether applied to the cheek\r\nexternally. In slighter cases two grains of opium with or without as much\r\ncamphor may be held in the mouth, and suffered to dissolve near the\r\naffected tooth, and be gradually swallowed. See Class I. 2. 4. 12.\r\nOdontalgia may be distinguished from otitis by the application of cold\r\nwater to the affected tooth; for as the pain of common tooth-ach is owing\r\nto torpor, whatever decreases stimulus adds to the torpor and consequent\r\npain; whereas the pain of an inflamed tooth being ceased by the increased\r\naction of the membranes of it is in some measure alleviated by the\r\napplication of cold.\r\n\r\n8. _Otitis._ Inflammation and consequent suppuration of some membranes of\r\nthe internal ear frequently occur in children, who sleep in cold rooms, or\r\nnear a cold wall, without a night-cap. If the bones are affected, they come\r\nout in a long process of time, and the child remains deaf of that ear. But\r\nin this case there is generally a fever attends this inflammation; and it\r\nthen belongs to another genus.\r\n\r\nM. M. A warmer night-cap. Warmish water should be gently syringed into the\r\near to keep it clean twice a day; and if it does not heal in a week, a\r\nlittle spirit of wine should be added; first about a fourth part, and it\r\nshould be gradually increased to half rectified spirit and half water: if\r\nit continues long to discharge matter with a very putrid smell, the bones\r\nare injured, and will in time find their exit, during which time the ear\r\nshould be kept clean by filling it with a weaker mixture of spirit of wine\r\nand water; or a solution of alum in water; which may be poured into the\r\near, as the head is inclined, and shook out again by turning the head, two\r\nor three times morning and evening. See Class II. 1. 4. 10.\r\n\r\n9. _Fistula lacrymalis._ The lacrymal sack, with its puncta lacrymalia and\r\nnasal duct, are liable to be destroyed by suppuration without fever; the\r\ntears then run over the eyelids, and inflame the edges of them, and the\r\ncheeks, by their perpetual moisture, and saline acrimony.\r\n\r\nM. M. By a nice surgical operation a new aperture is to be made from the\r\ninternal corner of the eye into the nostril, and a silver tube introduced,\r\nwhich supplies the defect by admitting the tears to pass again into the\r\nnostril. See Melanges de Chirurgie par M. Pouteau; who thinks he has\r\nimproved this operation.\r\n\r\n10. _Fistula in ano._ A mucous discharge from the anus, called by some\r\nwhite piles, or matter from a suppurated pile, has been mistaken for the\r\nmatter from a concealed fistula. A bit of cotton wool applied to the\r\nfundament to receive the matter, and renewed twice a day for a week or two,\r\nshould always be used before examination with the probe. The probe of an\r\nunskilful empyric sometimes does more harm in the loose cellular membrane\r\nof these parts than the original ulcer, by making a fistula he did not\r\nfind. The cure of a fistula in ano of those, who have been much addicted to\r\ndrinking spirituous liquor, or who have a tendency to pulmonary\r\nconsumption, is frequently of dangerous consequence, and is succeeded by\r\nulcers of the lungs, and death.\r\n\r\nM. M. Ward's paste, or 20 black pepper-corns taken after each meal twice a\r\nday; the pepper-corns should be cut each into two or three pieces. The late\r\nDr. Monro of Edinburgh asserted in his lectures, that he had known a\r\nfistula in ano cured by injecting first a mixture of rectified spirit of\r\nwine and water; and by gradually increasing the strength of it, till the\r\npatient could bear rectified spirit alone; by the daily use of which at\r\nlength the sides of the fistula became callous, and ceased to discharge,\r\nthough the cavity was left. A French surgeon has lately affirmed, that a\r\nwire of lead put in at the external opening of the ulcer, and brought\r\nthrough the rectum, and twisted together, will gradually wear itself\r\nthrough the gut, and thus effect a cure without much pain. The ends of the\r\nleaden wire must be twisted more and more as it becomes loose. Or, lastly,\r\nit must be laid open by the knife.\r\n\r\n11. _Fistula urethræ._ Where a stricture of the urethra exists, from\r\nwhatever cause, the patient, in forcing the stream of urine through the\r\nstructure, distends the urethra behind it; which after a time is liable to\r\nburst, and to become perforated; and some of the urine is pushed into the\r\ncellular membrane, occasioning fistulas, which sometimes have large\r\nsurfaces producing much matter, which is pressed out at the time of making\r\nwater, and has been mistaken for a catarrh of the bladder; these fistulas\r\nsometimes acquire an external opening in the perinæum, and part of the\r\nurine is discharged that way.\r\n\r\nCan this matter be distinguished from mucus of the bladder by the criterion\r\ndelivered in Class II. 1. 6. 6?\r\n\r\nM. M. The perpetual use of bougies, either of catgut or of caoutchouc. The\r\nlatter may be had at No. 37, Red-lion street, Holborn, London. The former\r\nare easily made, by moistening the catgut, and keeping it stretched till\r\ndry, and then rounding one end with a pen-knife. The use of a warm bath\r\nevery day for near an hour, at the heat of 94 or 96 degrees, for two or\r\nthree months, I knew to be uncommonly successful in one case; the extensive\r\nfistulas completely healing. The patient should introduce a bougie always\r\nbefore he makes water, and endeavour to make it as slowly as possible. See\r\nClass I. 2. 3. 24.\r\n\r\n12. _Hepatitis chronica._ Chronical inflammation of the liver. A collection\r\nof matter in the liver has frequently been found on dissection, which was\r\nnot suspected in the living subject. Though there may have been no certain\r\nsigns of such a collection of matter, owing to the insensibility of the\r\ninternal parts of this viscus; which has thus neither been attended with\r\npain, nor induced any fever; yet there may be in some cases reason to\r\nsuspect the existence of such an abscess; either from a sense of fulness in\r\nthe right hypochondre, or from transient pains sometimes felt there, or\r\nfrom pain on pressure, or from lying on the left side, and sometimes from a\r\ndegree of sensitive fever attending it.\r\n\r\nDr. Saunders suspects the acute hepatitis to exist in the inflammation of\r\nthe hepatic artery, and the chronical one in that of the vena portarum.\r\nTreatise on the Liver. Robinson. London.\r\n\r\n13. _Scrophula suppurans._ Suppurating scrophula. The indolent tumors of\r\nthe lymphatic glands are liable, after a long time, to regain their\r\nsensibility; and then, owing to their former torpor, an increased action of\r\nthe vessels, beyond what is natural, with inflammation, is the consequence\r\nof their new life, and suppuration succeeds. This cure of scrophula\r\ngenerally happens about puberty, when a new energy pervades the whole\r\nsystem, and unfolds the glands and organs of reproduction.\r\n\r\nM. M. See Class I. 2. 3. 21. Where scrophulous ulcers about the neck are\r\ndifficult to heal, Dr. Beddoes was informed, in Ireland, that an empyric\r\nhad had some success by inflaming them by an application of wood sorrel,\r\noxalis acetosella, the leaves of which are bruised in a mortar, and applied\r\non the ulcers for two or three days, and then some more lenient application\r\nis used.\r\n\r\nA poor boy, about twelve years old, had a large scrophulous ulcer on one\r\nside of the chest beneath the clavicle, and another under his jaw; he was\r\ndirected, about three weeks ago, to procure a pound of dry oak-bark from\r\nthe tanners, and to reduce it to fine powder, and to add to it one ounce of\r\nwhite lead in fine powder, and to cover the ulcers daily with it, keeping\r\nit on by brown paper and a bandage. He came to me a few minutes ago, to\r\nshew me that both the ulcers are quite healed. The constant application of\r\nlinen rags, moistened with a solution of an ounce of sugar of lead in a\r\npint of water, I think I have seen equally efficacious.\r\n\r\n14. _Scorbutus suppurans._ In the sea-scurvy there exists an inactivity of\r\nvenous absorption, whence vibices and petechiæ, and sometimes ulcers. As\r\nthe column of blood pressing on the of origins of the veins of the lower\r\nextremities, when the body is erect, opposes the ascent of the blood in\r\nthem, they are more frequently liable to become enlarged, and to produce\r\nvarixes, or vibices, or, lastly, ulcers about the legs, than on the upper\r\nparts of the body. The exposure to cold is believed to be another cause of\r\nulcers on the extremities; as happens to many of the poor in winter at\r\nLisbon, who sleep in the open air, without stockings, on the steps of their\r\nchurches or palaces. See Class I. 2. 1. 15.\r\n\r\nM. M. A bandage spread with plaster to cover the whole limb tight. Rags\r\ndipped in a solution of sugar of lead. A warm flannel stocking or roller.\r\nWhite lead and oak bark, both in fine powder. Horizontal rest.\r\n\r\n15. _Scirrhus suppurans._ When a scirrhus affects any gland of no great\r\nextent or sensibility, it is, after a long period of time, liable to\r\nsuppurate without inducing fever, like the indolent tumors of the\r\nconglobate or lymphatic glands above mentioned; whence collections of\r\nmatter are often found after death both in men and other animals; as in the\r\nliver of swine, which have been fed with the grounds of fermented mixtures\r\nin the distilleries. Another termination of scirrhus is in cancer, as\r\ndescribed below. See Class I. 2. 3. 22.\r\n\r\n16. _Carcinoma._ Cancer. When a schirrous tumor regains its sensibility by\r\nnature, or by any accidental hurt, new vessels shoot amongst the yet\r\ninsensible parts of it, and a new secretion takes place of a very injurious\r\nmaterial. This cancerous matter is absorbed, and induces swelling of the\r\nneighbouring lymphatic glands; which also become schirrous, and afterwards\r\ncancerous.\r\n\r\nThis cancerous matter does not seem to acquire its malignant or contagious\r\nquality, till the cancer becomes an open ulcer; and the matter secreted in\r\nit is thus exposed to the air. Then it evidently becomes contagious,\r\nbecause it not only produces hectic fever, like common matter in ulcers\r\nopen to the air; but it also, as it becomes absorbed, swells the lymphatic\r\nglands in its vicinity; as those of the axilla, when the open cancer is on\r\nthe breast. See Class II. 1. 3.\r\n\r\nHence exsection before the cancer is open is generally a cure; but after\r\nthe matter has been exposed to the air, it is seldom of service; as the\r\nneighbouring lymphatic glands are already infected. I have observed some of\r\nthese patients after the operation to have had diseased livers, which might\r\neither have previously existed, or have been produced by the fear or\r\nanxiety attending the operation.\r\n\r\nErosion with arsenic, after the cancer is become an open ulcer, has\r\ngenerally no better effect than exsection, but has been successful before\r\nulceration. The best manner of using arsenic, is by mixing one grain with a\r\ndram of lapis calaminaris, and strewing on the cancer some of the powder\r\nevery day, till the whole is destroyed.\r\n\r\nCancers on the face are said to arise from the periosteum, and that unless\r\nthis be destroyed by the knife, or by caustics, the cancer certainly\r\nrecurs. After the cancer becomes an open ulcer of some extent, a purulent\r\nfever supervenes, as from other open ulcers, and gradually destroys the\r\npatient. See Class II. 1. 6. 13.\r\n\r\nTwo very interesting cases have been lately published by Dr. Ewart, of\r\nBath, in which carbonic acid gas, or fixed air, was kept constantly in\r\ncontact with the open cancerous ulcers of the breast; which then healed\r\nlike other common ulcers. This is rather to be ascribed to the exclusion of\r\noxygen, than to any specific virtue in the carbonic acid. As in common\r\nulcers the matter does not induce hectic fever, till it has been exposed to\r\nthe air, and then probably united with oxygen.\r\n\r\nThe manner of applying the fixed air, is by including the cancer in one\r\nhalf or hemisphere of a large bladder; the edges are made to adhere to the\r\nskin by adhesive plaster, or perhaps a mixture of one part of honey with\r\nabout twenty parts of carpenter's glue might better suit some tender skins.\r\nThe bladder is then kept constantly filled with carbonic acid gas, by means\r\nof a pipe in the neck of it; and the matter let out at a small aperture\r\nbeneath.\r\n\r\n17. _Arthrocele._ Swelling of the joints seems to have its remote cause in\r\nthe softness of the bones, for they could not swell unless they were\r\npreviously softened, see Class I. 2. 2. 14. The epiphyses, or ends of the\r\nbones, being naturally of a looser texture, are most liable to this\r\ndisease, and perhaps the cartilages and capsular ligaments may also become\r\ninflamed and swelled along with the heads of the bones. This malady is\r\nliable to distort the fingers and knees, and is usually called gout or\r\nrheumatism; the former of which is liable to disable the fingers by\r\nchalk-stones, and thence to have somewhat a similar appearance. But the\r\narthrocele, or swelling of the joints, affects people who have not been\r\nintemperate in the use of fermented or spirituous liquors; or who have not\r\npreviously had a regular gout in their feet; and in both these\r\ncircumstances differs from the gout. Nor does it accord with the\r\ninflammatory rheumatism, as it is not attended with fever, and because the\r\ntumors of the joints never entirely subside. The pain or sensibility, which\r\nthe bones acquire, when they are inflamed, may be owing to the new vessels,\r\nwhich shoot in them in their soft state, as well as to the distention of\r\nthe old ones.\r\n\r\nM. M. Half a grain of opium twice a day, gradually increased to a grain,\r\nbut not further, for many months. Thirty grains of powder of bark twice a\r\nday for many months. Ten grains of bone-ashes, or calcined hartshorn, twice\r\na day, with decoction of madder? Soda phosphorata?\r\n\r\n18. _Arthropuosis._ Joint-evil. This differs from the former, as that never\r\nsuppurates; these ulcers of the joints are generally esteemed to arise from\r\nscrophula; but as scrophula is a disease of the lymphatic or absorbent\r\nsystem, and this consists in the suppuration of the membranes, or glands,\r\nor cartilages about the joints, there does not seem a sufficient analogy to\r\nauthorize their arrangement under the same name.\r\n\r\nThe white swelling of the knee, when it suppurates, comes under this\r\nspecies, with variety of other ulcers attended with carious bones.\r\n\r\n19. _Caries ossium._ A caries of the bones may be termed a suppuration of\r\nthem; it differs from the above, as it generally is occasioned by some\r\nexternal injury, as in decaying teeth; or by venereal virus, as in nodes on\r\nthe tibia; or by other matter derived to the bone in malignant fevers; and\r\nis not confined to the ends of them.\r\n\r\nThe separation of the dead bone from the living is a work of some time. See\r\nSect. XXXIII. 3. 1.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nORDO I.\r\n\r\n_Increased Sensation._\r\n\r\nGENUS V.\r\n\r\n_With the Production of new Vessels by external Membranes or Glands,\r\nwithout Fever._\r\n\r\nThe ulcers, or eruptions, which are formed on the external skin, or on the\r\nmouth or throat, or on the air-cells of the lungs, or on the intestines,\r\nall of which are more or less exposed to the contact of the atmospheric\r\nair, which we breathe, and which in some proportion we swallow with our\r\nfood and saliva; or to the contact of the inflammable air, or hydrogen,\r\nwhich is set at liberty by the putrefying aliment in the intestines, or by\r\nputrefying matter in large abscesses; all of them produce contagious\r\nmatter; which, on being inoculated into the skin of another person, will\r\nproduce fever, or a similar disease.\r\n\r\nIn some cases even the matter formed beneath the skin becomes in some\r\ndegree contagious, at least so much so as to produce fever of the hectic or\r\nmalignant kind, as soon as it has pierced through the skin, and has thus\r\ngained access to some kind of air; as the fresh puss of a common abscess;\r\nor the putrid pus of an abscess, which has been long confined; or of\r\ncancerous ulcers.\r\n\r\nFrom this analogy there is reason to suspect, that the matter of all\r\ncontagious diseases, whether with or without fever, is not infectious till\r\nit has acquired something from the air; which, by oxygenating the secreted\r\nmatter, may probably produce a new acid. And secondly, that in hectic fever\r\na part of the purulent matter is absorbed; or acts on the surface of the\r\nulcer; as variolous matter affects the inoculated part of the arm. And that\r\nhectic fever is therefore caused by the matter of an open ulcer; and not by\r\nthe sensation in the ulcer independent of the aerated pus, which lies on\r\nit. Which may account for the venereal matter from buboes not giving the\r\ninfection, according to the experiments of the late Mr. Hunter, and for\r\nsome other phenomena of contagion. See Variola discreta, Class II. 1. 3. 9.\r\n\r\nSPECIES.\r\n\r\n1. _Gonorrhoea venerea._ A pus-like contagious material discharged from the\r\nurethra after impure cohabitation, with smarting or heat on making water;\r\nwhich begins at the external extremity of the urethra, to which the\r\ncontagious matter is applied, and where it has access to the air.\r\n\r\nM. M. In this state of the venereal disease once venesection, with mild\r\ncathartics of senna and manna, with mucilage, as almond emulsion, and gum\r\narabic, taken for two or three weeks, absolve the cure. Is camphor of use\r\nto relieve the ardor urinæ? Do balsams increase or lessen the heat of\r\nurine? Neutral salts certainly increase the smarting in making water, by\r\nincreasing the acrimony of the urine.\r\n\r\nCan the discharge from the urethra be soon stopped by saturnine injections,\r\nor mercurial ones, or with solution of blue vitriol, at first very dilute,\r\nand gradually made stronger? And at the same time lest the syphilis, or\r\ngeneral disease, should supervene, the patient might take a quarter of a\r\ngrain of corrosive sublimate of mercury twice a day, as directed below?\r\n\r\n2. _Syphilis._ Venereal disease. The contagion shews itself in ulcers on\r\nthe part first inoculated, as chancres; ulcers on the tonsils succeed, with\r\neruption on the skin, especially about the roots of the hair; afterwards on\r\nother parts of the skin, terminating in dry scabs; and lastly, with pain\r\nand swelling of the bones.\r\n\r\nThe corona veneris, or crown of Venus, consists of the eruptions at the\r\nroots of the hair appearing most round the forehead; which is occasioned by\r\nthis part being more exposed to the air; which we observed, at the\r\nbeginning of this genus, either produces or increases the virulence of\r\ncontagious matter. But it is difficult to conceive from this history, why\r\nthe throat should be first affected; as it cannot be supposed, that the\r\ndisease is so often taken by the saliva, like the small-pox, though this\r\nmay sometimes occur, perhaps very often. The connection between the\r\ngenitals in men and the throat, is treated of in Class IV. 1. 2. 7.\r\nHydrophobia.\r\n\r\nM. M. A quarter of a grain of corrosive sublimate of mercury, taken thrice\r\na day for five or six weeks, made into a pill with breadcrumbs, or\r\ndissolved in a spoonful of brandy and water, is a very efficacious and\r\nalmost certain cure. When it does not succeed, it is owing either to the\r\ndrug being bad, or to its having precipitated from the brandy, or from its\r\nbeing spoiled in the pill by long keeping. Opium contributes much to\r\nexpedite the cure both of the simple gonorrhoea, and of venereal ulcers, by\r\nincreasing absorption both from the mucous membrane, and from the surface\r\nof ulcers.\r\n\r\n3. _Lepra._ Leprosy. Leprosy of the Greeks. The skin is rough with white\r\nbranny scales, which are full of chinks; often moist beneath, and itching.\r\nThe scales on the head or arms of some drinking people are a disease of\r\nthis kind. The perspirable matter designed for the purpose of lubricating\r\nthe external skin is secreted in this disease in a too viscid state, owing\r\nto the inflammation of the subcutaneous vessels; and, as the absorbents act\r\ntoo strongly at the same time, a viscid mucus is left adhering to the\r\nsurface of the skin.\r\n\r\nIn the leprosy of the Jews, described in the thirteenth and fourteenth\r\nchapters of Leviticus, the depression of the sore beneath the surface of\r\nthe skin, and the hairs in it becoming white, seem to have been the\r\nprincipal circumstances, which the priest was directed to attend to for the\r\npurpose of ascertaining the disease.\r\n\r\nM. M. Essence of antimony from 20 drops to 100 twice or thrice a day, with\r\nhalf a pint of decoction of elm-bark; or tincture of cantharides from 20 to\r\n60 drops four times a day; or sublimate of mercury, with much diluting\r\nfluid. Acid of vitriol? Perhaps the cure chiefly depends on much dilution\r\nwith water, from two to four pints a day, in which elm-bark, or pine-buds,\r\nor juniper-tops, may be boiled. Bath or Buxton water drank in large\r\nquantities. Warm bath. Oil-skin bound on the part to confine the\r\nperspirable matter. Ointment of tar and suet; or poultice for two or three\r\ndays, and then cerate with lapis calaminaris. Diet of raisins and bread.\r\nAbstinence from wine, beer, and all spirits.\r\n\r\n4. _Elephantiasis._ Leprosy of the Arabs. A contagious disease; the skin is\r\nthickened, wrinkled, rough, unctuous, destitute of hair, without any\r\nsensation of touch in the extremities of the limbs; the face deformed with\r\ntubercles; the voice hoarse, and with a nasal tone. Cullen.\r\n\r\n5. _Framboesia._ Yaws is said to be contagious and hereditary. It\r\nprincipally affects the negroes in the West Indies. Edinb. Essays, Vol. VI.\r\n\r\n6. _Psora._ Itch. A contagious prurient eruption. There are two kinds of\r\nitch, that which appears between the fingers, and under the joints of the\r\nknees and elbows; and that which seldom is seen in these places, but all\r\nover the other parts of the body. The latter is seldom thought to be the\r\nitch, as it does not easily infect even a bedfellow, and resists the usual\r\nmeans of cure by brimstone.\r\n\r\nIf the itch be cured too hastily by rubbing mercurial or arsenical\r\npreparations over the whole body, or on too great a part of it, many bad\r\nsymptoms are produced; as weakness of digestion, with pale bloated\r\ncountenance, and tendency to dropsy. I have twice seen St. Vitus's dance\r\noccur from the use of a mercurial girdle; and once a swelled liver. I have\r\nalso seen a swelled spleen and swelled legs from the external use of\r\narsenic in the cure of the itch. And very numerous and large phlegmons\r\ncommonly succeed the too hasty cure of it by other means.\r\n\r\nThere does not appear a strict analogy between the hasty cure of the itch,\r\nand the retrocession of the pustles in the secondary fever of the\r\nsmall-pox; because in that the absorption of the matter is evinced by the\r\nswelling of the face and hands, as the pustles recede, as explained in\r\nClass II. 1. 3. 9. Variola discreta. And a fever is produced by this\r\nabsorption; neither of which happen, when the pustles of the itch are\r\ndestroyed by mercury or arsenic.\r\n\r\nNor can these inconveniences, which occur on the too hasty cure of the\r\nitch, be explained by those which follow the cure of some kinds of gutta\r\nrosea, Class II. 1. 4. 6. as in those the eruptions on the face were an\r\nassociated disease with inflammation of the liver or stomach, which they\r\nwere accustomed to relieve; whereas the itch is not known to have had any\r\nprevious catenation with other diseases.\r\n\r\nIn the itch there exists not only great irritation in the production of the\r\npustles, but great sensation is caused by their acrimony afterwards;\r\ninsomuch that the pain of itching, without the interrupted smarting\r\noccasioned by scratching, would be intolerable. This great excitement of\r\nthe two sensorial powers of irritation and sensation is so great, when the\r\npustles are diffused over the whole surface of the body, that a torpor\r\nsucceeds the sudden ceasing of it; which affects those parts of the system,\r\nwhich were most catenated with the new motions of the skin, as the stomach,\r\nwhence indigestion and flatulency; or which are generally most liable to\r\nfall into torpor, as the numerous glands, which form the liver. Whence the\r\ndiseases consequent to the hasty cure of the itch are diseases of debility,\r\nas tumid viscera, oedematous swellings, and St. Vitus's dance, which is a\r\ndebility of association. In the same manner indigestion, with green\r\nevacuations, are said to follow an injudicious application of cerussa to\r\nstop too hastily the exsudation behind the ears of children, Class I. 1. 2.\r\n9. And dropsies are liable to succeed the cure of old ulcers of the legs,\r\nwhich have long stimulated the system.\r\n\r\nM. M. The size of a large pea, of an ointment consisting of one part of\r\nwhite precipitate of mercury to six parts of hogs' lard well triturated\r\ntogether, to be rubbed on a part of the body every night, and washed off\r\nwith soap and water next morning, till every part is cleared; with lac\r\nsulphuris twenty grains to be taken every morning inwardly. Warm saline\r\nbath, with white vitriol in it. Flowers of sulphur mixed with thick gruel,\r\nwith hogs fat. With either of which the body may be smeared all over.\r\n\r\n7. _Psora ebriorum._ Elderly people, who have been much addicted to\r\nspirituous drinks, as beer, wine, or alcohol, are liable to an eruption all\r\nover their bodies; which is attended with very afflicting itching, and\r\nwhich they probably propagate from one part of their bodies to another with\r\ntheir own nails by scratching themselves. I saw fatal effects in one such\r\npatient, by a too extensive use of a solution of lead; the eruption\r\ndisappeared, he became dropsical, and died; I suppose from the too suddenly\r\nceasing of the great stimulus caused by the eruptions over the whole skin,\r\nas in the preceding article.\r\n\r\nM. M. The patient should gradually accustom himself to half his usual\r\nquantity of vinous potation. The warm bath, with one pound of salt to every\r\nthree gallons. Mercurial ointments on small parts of the skin at a time. A\r\ngrain of opium at night instead of the usual potation of wine or beer.\r\n\r\n8. _Herpes._ Herpes consists of gregarious spreading excoriations, which\r\nare succeeded by branny scales or scabs. In this disease there appears to\r\nbe a deficient absorption of the subcutaneous mucus, as well as\r\ninflammation and increased secretion of it. For the fluid not only\r\nexcoriates the parts in its vicinity by its acrimony, but is very saline to\r\nthe taste, as some of these patients have assured me; I believe this kind\r\nof eruption, as well as the tinea, and perhaps all other cutaneous\r\neruption, is liable to be inoculated in other parts of the body by the\r\nfinger-nails of the patients in scratching themselves.\r\n\r\nIt is liable to affect the hands, and to return at distant periods; and is\r\nprobably a secondary disease, as well as the zona ignea, or shingles,\r\ndescribed below.\r\n\r\nM. M. Poultice the eruption with bread and milk, or raw carrots grated, for\r\ntwo or three whole days, to dilute or receive the discharged fluid, and\r\nabate the inflammation; then cover the parts with fresh cerate mixed with\r\nlapis calaminaris. On the parts not excoriated mercurial ointment, made of\r\none part of white calx of mercury and six of hogs' fat. Internally, after\r\nvenesection, gentle repeated cathartics. Lastly, the bark. Acid of vitriol.\r\nBolus Armeniæ, or testacia. Antimonials. Decoction of interior bark of elm.\r\n\r\n9. _Zona ignea._ Shingles. This eruption has been thought a species of\r\nherpes by some writers, and by others a species of erysipelas. Yellow or\r\nlivid vesicles appear, producing a corrosive ichor, which is sometimes\r\nattended with a degree of fever. It is said to infest sometimes the thorax\r\nand ribs, but its most general situation is on the small of the back, over\r\none kidney, extending forward over the course of one of the ureters.\r\n\r\nThere is reason to suspect, that this also is a secondary or sympathetic\r\ndisease, as well as the preceding one; but future observations are\r\nrequired, before it can be removed to the fourth class, or diseases of\r\nassociation. In three patients I have been induced to believe, that the\r\neruption on the loins was a translation of inflammation from the external\r\nmembrane of the kidney to the skin. They had, for a day or two before the\r\nappearance of the eruption, complained of a dull pain on the region of one\r\nkidney, but without vomiting; by which it was distinguished from nephritis\r\ninterna, or gravel; and without pain down the outside of the thigh, by\r\nwhich it was distinguished from sciatica. In other situations the shingles\r\nmay sympathize with other internal membranes, as in a case published by Dr.\r\nRussel (De Tabe Glandulari), where the retrocession of the shingles was\r\nsucceeded by a serious dyspnæa.\r\n\r\nM. M. Venesection, if the pulse is strong. Calomel three or four grains,\r\nvery mild repeated cathartics. Poultice for a few days, then cerate of\r\nlapis calaminaris, as in herpes. A grain of emetic tartar dissolved in a\r\npint of water, and taken so as to empty the stomach and intestines, is said\r\nmuch to hasten the cure; compresses soaked in a saturnine solution are\r\nrecommended externally on the eruption; and cerate where there are\r\nulcerations. Desanet's Surgical Journal, Vol. II. p. 378. If this be a\r\nvicarious disease, it should continue half a lunation; lest, on its\r\nceasing, the bad habits of motion of the primary disease should not have\r\nbeen so perfectly dissevered, but that they may recur.\r\n\r\n10. _Annulus repens._ Ring-worm. A prurient eruption formed in a circle,\r\naffecting children, and would seem to be the work of insects, according to\r\nthe theory of Linnæus, who ascribes the itch and dysentery to microscopic\r\nanimalcula. These animalcula are probably the effect, and not the cause, of\r\nthese eruptions; as they are to be seen in all putrescent animal fluids.\r\nThe annular propagation of the ring-worm, and its continuing to enlarge its\r\nperiphery, is well accounted for by the acrimony of the ichor or saline\r\nfluid eroding the skin in its vicinity.\r\n\r\nM. M. Cover the eruption daily with ink. With white mercurial ointment, as\r\ndescribed above in herpes. With solution of white vitriol ten grains to an\r\nounce. These metallic calces stimulate the absorbents into stronger action,\r\nwhence the fluid has its saline part reabsorbed, and that before it has\r\naccess to the air, which probably adds to its acrimony by oxygenating it,\r\nand thus, producing a new acid.\r\n\r\n11. _Tinea._ Scald head. This contagious eruption affects the roots of the\r\nhair, and is generally most virulent around the edges of the hair on the\r\nback part of the head; as the corona veneris appears most on the edges of\r\nthe hair on the forepart of the head; for in these parts the eruption about\r\nthe roots of the hair is most exposed to the external air, by which its\r\nacrimony or noxious quality is increased.\r\n\r\nThe absorption of the matter thus oxygenated swells the lymphatics of the\r\nneck by its stimulus, occasioning many little hard lumps beneath the seat\r\nof the eruption; when this happens, the sooner it is cured the better, lest\r\nthe larger lymphatics of the neck should become affected.\r\n\r\nM. M. The art of curing these eruptions consists, first, in abating the\r\ninflammation, and consequent secretion of a noxious material. Secondly, to\r\nprevent its access to the air, which so much increases its acrimony. And\r\nthirdly, to promote the absorption of it, before it has been exposed to the\r\nair; for these purposes venesection once, and gentle cathartics, which\r\npromote absorption by emptying the blood-vessels. Next poultices and\r\nfomentations, with warm water, abate inflammation by diluting the saline\r\nacrimony of the secreted fluid, and abating the painful sensation.\r\nAfterwards cerate joined with some metallic calx, as of zinc or lead, or\r\nsolution of lead, mercury, or copper, or iron, which may stimulate the\r\nabsorbent system into stronger action.\r\n\r\nCover the shaved head with tar and suet, and a bladder; this, by keeping\r\nthe air from the secreted fluid, much contributes to its mildness, and the\r\nstimulus of the tar increases its absorption. See the three preceding\r\nspecies of this genus.\r\n\r\n12. _Crusta lactea._ Milk-crust is a milder disease than tinea, affecting\r\nthe face as well as the hairy scalp of very young children. It is not\r\ninfectious, nor liable to swell the lymphatics in its vicinity like the\r\ntinea.\r\n\r\nM. M. Cover the eruption with cerate made with lapis calaminaris, to be\r\nrenewed every day. Mix one grain of emetic tartar with forty grains of\r\nchalk, and divide into eight papers, one to be taken twice a day, or with\r\nmagnesia alba, if stools are wanted. The child should be kept cool and much\r\nin the air.\r\n\r\n13. _Trichoma._ Plica polonica. A contagious disease, in which the hair is\r\nsaid to become alive and bleed, forming inextricable knots or plaits of\r\ngreat length, like the fabled head of Medusa, with intolerable pain, so as\r\nto confine the sufferer on his bed for years.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nORDO I.\r\n\r\n_Increased Sensation._\r\n\r\nGENUS VI.\r\n\r\n_With Fever consequent to the Production of new Vessels or Fluids._\r\n\r\nSPECIES.\r\n\r\n1. _Febris sensitiva._ Sensitive fever, when unmixed with either irritative\r\nor inirritative fever, may be distinguished from either of them by the less\r\ncomparative diminution of muscular strength; or in other words, from its\r\nbeing attended with less diminution of the sensorial power of irritation.\r\nAn example of unmixed sensitive fever may generally be taken from the\r\npulmonary consumption; in this disease patients are seen to walk about with\r\nease, and to do all the common offices of life for weeks, and even months,\r\nwith a pulse of 120 strokes in a minute; while in other fevers, whether\r\nirritated or inirritated, with a pulse of this frequency, the patient\r\ngenerally lies upon the bed, and exerts no muscular efforts without\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nThe cause of this curious phenomenon is thus to be understood; in the\r\nsensitive fever a new sensorial power, viz. that of sensation, is\r\nsuperadded to that of irritation; which in other fevers alone carries on\r\nthe increased circulation. Whence the power of irritation is not much more\r\nexhausted than in health; and those muscular motions, which are produced in\r\nconsequence of it, as those which are exerted in keeping the body upright\r\nin walking, riding, and in the performance of many customary actions, are\r\nlittle impaired. For an account of the irritated sensitive fever, see Class\r\nII. 1. 2. 1.; for the inirritated sensitive fever, Class II. 1. 3. 1. IV.\r\n2. 4. 11.\r\n\r\n2. _Febris a pure clauso._ Fever from inclosed matter is generally of the\r\nirritated sensitive kind, and continues for many weeks, and even months,\r\nafter the abscess is formed; but is distinguished from the fever from\r\naerated matter in open ulcers, because there are seldom any night-sweats,\r\nor colliquative diarrhoea in this, as in the latter. The pulse is also\r\nharder, and requires occasional venesection, and cathartics, to abate the\r\ninflammatory fever; which is liable to increase again every three or four\r\ndays, till at length, unless the matter has an exit, it destroys the\r\npatient. In this fever the matter, not having been exposed to the air, has\r\nnot acquired oxygenation; in which a new acid, or some other noxious\r\nproperty, is produced; which acts like contagion on the constitution\r\ninducing fever-fits, called hectic fever, which terminate with sweats or\r\ndiarrhoea; whereas the matter in the closed abscess is either not absorbed,\r\nor does not so affect the circulation as to produce diurnal or hectic\r\nfever-fits; but the stimulus of the abscess excites so much sensation as to\r\ninduce perpetual pyrexia, or inflammatory fever, without such marked\r\nremissions. Nevertheless there sometimes is no fever produced, when the\r\nmatter is lodged in a part of little sensibility, as in the liver; yet a\r\nwhite pus-like sediment in those cases exists I believe generally in the\r\nurine, with occasional wandering pains about the region of the liver or\r\nchest.\r\n\r\n3. _Vomica._ An abscess in the lungs is sometimes produced after\r\nperipneumony, the cough and shortness of breath continue in less degree,\r\nwith difficulty in lying on the well side, and with sensitive irritated\r\nfever, as explained in the preceding article.\r\n\r\nThe occasional increase of fever, with hard pulse and sizy blood, in these\r\npatients, is probably owing to the inflammation of the walls of the vomica;\r\nas it is attended with difficulty of breathing, and requires venesection.\r\nMr. B----, a child about seven years old, lived about five weeks in this\r\nsituation, with a pulse from 150 to 170 in a minute, without sweats, or\r\ndiarrhoea, or sediment in his water, except mucus occasionally; and took\r\nsufficient nourishment during the whole time. The blood taken was always\r\ncovered with a strong cupped size, and on his death three or four pints of\r\nmatter were found in one side of the chest; which had probably, but lately,\r\nbeen effused from a vomica. This child was frequently induced to swing,\r\nboth in a reciprocating and in a rotatory swing, without any apparent\r\nabsorption of matter; in both these swings he expressed pleasure, and did\r\nnot appear to be vertiginous.\r\n\r\nM. M. Repeated emetics. Digitalis? Perseverance in rotatory swinging. See\r\nClass II. 1. 6. 7.\r\n\r\nMr. I. had laboured some months under a vomica after a peripneumony, he was\r\nat length taken with a catarrh, which was in some degree endemic in March\r\n1795, which occasioned him to sneeze much, during which a copious\r\nhæmorrhage from the lungs occurred, and he spit up at the same time half a\r\npint of very fetid matter, and recovered. Hence errhines may be\r\noccasionally used with advantage.\r\n\r\n4. _Empyema._ When the matter from an abscess in the lungs finds its way\r\ninto the cavity of the chest, it is called an empyema. A servant man, after\r\na violent peripneumony, was seized with symptoms of empyema, and it was\r\ndetermined, after some time, to perform the operation; this was explained\r\nto him, and the usual means were employed by his friends to encourage him,\r\n\"by advising him not to be afraid.\" By which good advice he conceived so\r\nmuch fear, that he ran away early next morning, and returned in about a\r\nweek quite well. Did the great fear promote the absorption of the matter,\r\nlike the sickness occasioned by digitalis? Fear renders the external skin\r\npale; by this continued decrease of the action of the absorbents of the\r\nskin might not those of the lungs be excited into greater activity? and\r\nthus produce increased pulmonary absorption by reverse sympathy, as it\r\nproduces pale urine, and even stools, by direct sympathy?\r\n\r\nM.M. Digitalis?\r\n\r\n5. _Febris Mesenterica._ Fever from matter formed in the mesentery is\r\nprobably more frequent than is suspected. It commences with pain in the\r\nbowels, with irritated sensitive fever; and continues many weeks, and even\r\nmonths, requiring occasional venesection, and mild cathartics; till at\r\nlength the continuance of the pyrexia, or inflammatory fever, destroys the\r\npatient. This is an affection of the lymphatic glands, and properly belongs\r\nto scrophula; but as the matter is not exposed to the air, no hectic fever,\r\nproperly so called, is induced.\r\n\r\n6. _Febris a pure aerato._ Fever from aerated matter. A great collection of\r\nmatter often continues a long time, and is sometimes totally absorbed, even\r\nfrom venereal buboes, without producing any disorder in the arterial\r\nsystem. At length, if it becomes putrid by its delay, and one part of the\r\nmatter thus becomes aerated by the air given out by the other part; or if\r\nthe ulcer has been opened, so that any part of it has been exposed to the\r\nair for but one day, a hectic fever is produced. Whence the utility arises\r\nof opening large abscesses by setons, as in that case little or no hectic\r\nfever is induced; because the matter is squeezed out by the side of the\r\nspongy threads of cotton, and little or no air is admitted; or by tapping\r\nthe abscess with a trocar, as mentioned in ischias, Class II. 1. 2. 18.\r\n\r\nIn this fever the pulse is about 120 in a minute, and its access is\r\ngenerally in an evening, and sometimes about noon also, with sweats or\r\npurging towards morning, or urine with pus-like sediment; and the patients\r\nbear this fever better than any other with so quick a pulse; and lastly,\r\nwhen all the matter from a concealed ulcer is absorbed, or when an open\r\nulcer is healed, the hectic fever ceases. Here the absorbed matter is\r\nsupposed to produce the fever, and the diarrhoea, sweats, or copious muddy\r\nurine, to be simply the consequence of increased secretion, and not to\r\nconsist of the purulent matter, which was supposed to be absorbed from the\r\nulcer. See Sudor calidus, Class I. 1. 2. 3.\r\n\r\nThe action of the air on ulcers, as we have already shewn, increases the\r\nacrimony of the purulent matter, and even converts it into a weaker kind of\r\ncontagious matter; that is, to a material inducing fever. This was ascribed\r\nto the union of the azotic part of the atmosphere with the effused pus in\r\nSect. XXVIII. 2. but by contemplating more numerous facts and analogies, I\r\nam now induced to believe, that it is by the union of oxygen with it;\r\nfirst, because oxygen so greedily unites with other animal substances, as\r\nthe blood, that it will pass through a moist bladder to combine with it,\r\naccording to the experiment of Dr. Priestley. Secondly, because the poisons\r\nof venomous creatures are supposed to be acids of different kinds, and are\r\nprobably formed by the contact of air after their secretion. And lastly,\r\nbecause the contagious matter from other ulcers, as in itch, or small-pox,\r\nare formed on external membranes, and are probably combinations of animal\r\nmatter and oxygen, producing other new acids; but further experiments must\r\ndetermine this question.\r\n\r\nIt was thought a subject of consequence by the Æsculapian Society at\r\nEdinburgh, to find a criterion which should distinguish pus from mucus, for\r\nthe purpose of more certainly discovering the presence of ulcers in\r\npulmonary diseases, or in the urinary passages. For this purpose that\r\nsociety offered their first gold medal, which was conferred on the late Mr.\r\nCharles Darwin, in the year 1778, for his experiments on this subject. From\r\nwhich he deduces the following conclusions:\r\n\r\n    \"1. Pus and mucus are both soluble in the vitriolic acid, though in\r\n    very different proportions, pus being much the less soluble.\r\n\r\n    2. The addition of water to either of these compounds decomposes it;\r\n    the mucus thus separated, either swims on the mixture, or forms large\r\n    flocci in it; whereas the pus falls to the bottom, and forms on\r\n    agitation a uniform turbid mixture.\r\n\r\n    3. Pus is diffusible through a diluted vitriolic acid, though mucus is\r\n    not; the same occurs with water, or a solution of sea salt.\r\n\r\n    4. Nitrous acid dissolves both pus and mucus; water added to the\r\n    solution of pus produces a precipitate; and the fluid above becomes\r\n    clear and green; while water and the solution of mucus form a dirty\r\n    coloured fluid.\r\n\r\n    5. Alkaline lixivium dissolves (though sometimes with difficulty)\r\n    mucus, and generally pus.\r\n\r\n    6. Water precipitates pus from such a solution, but does not mucus.\r\n\r\n    7. Where alkaline lixivium does not dissolve pus, it still\r\n    distinguishes it from mucus; as it then prevents its diffusion through\r\n    water.\r\n\r\n    8. Coagulable lymph is neither soluble in diluted nor concentrated\r\n    vitriolic acid.\r\n\r\n    9. Water produces no change on a solution of serum in alkaline\r\n    lixivium, until after long standing, and then only a very slight\r\n    sediment appears.\r\n\r\n    10. Corrosive sublimate coagulates mucus, but does not pus.\r\n\r\n    From the above experiments it appears, that strong vitriolic acid and\r\n    water, diluted vitriolic acid, and caustic alkaline lixivium and water\r\n    will serve to distinguish pus from mucus; that the vitriolic acid can\r\n    separate it from coagulable lymph, and alkaline lixivium from serum.\r\n\r\n    And hence, when a person has any expectorated material, the composition\r\n    of which he wishes to ascertain, let him dissolve it in vitriolic acid,\r\n    and in caustic alkaline lixivium; and then add pure water to both\r\n    solutions: and if there is a fair precipitation in each, he may be\r\n    assured that some pus is present. If in neither a precipitation occurs,\r\n    it is a certain test, that the material is entirely mucus. If the\r\n    material cannot be made to dissolve in alkaline lixivium by time and\r\n    trituration, we have also reason to believe that it is pus.\"\r\n    Experiments on Pus and Mucus. Cadell. London.\r\n\r\n7. _Phthisis pulmonalis._ In pulmonary consumption the fever is generally\r\nsupposed to be the consequence of the stimulus of absorbed matter\r\ncirculating in the blood-vessels, and not simply of its stimulus on their\r\nextremities in the surface of the ulcers; as mentioned in Class II. 1. 5.\r\nand Class II. 1. 3. 9. The ulcers are probably sometimes occasioned by the\r\nputrid acrimony of effused blood remaining in the air-cells of the lungs\r\nafter an hæmoptoe. See Class I. 2. 1. 9. The remote cause of consumption is\r\ningeniously ascribed by Dr. Beddoes to the hyper-oxygenation of the blood,\r\nas mentioned Section XXVIII. 2.\r\n\r\nAs the patients liable to consumption are of the inirritable temperament,\r\nas appears by the large pupils of their eyes; there is reason to believe,\r\nthat the hæmoptoe is immediately occasioned by the deficient absorption of\r\nthe blood at the extremities of the bronchial vein; and that one difficulty\r\nof healing the ulcers is occasioned by the deficient absorption of the\r\nfluids effused into them. See Sect. XXX. 1. and 2.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of healing pulmonary ulcers may be owing, as its remote\r\ncause, to the incessant motion of all the parts of the lungs; whence no\r\nscab, or indurated mucus, can be formed so as to adhere on them. Whence\r\nthese naked ulcers are perpetually exposed to the action of the air on\r\ntheir surfaces, converting their mild purulent matter into a contagious\r\nichor; which not only prevents them from healing, but by its action on\r\ntheir circumferences, like the matter of itch or tinea, contributes to\r\nspread them wider. See the preceding article, and Sect. XXXIII. 2. 7. where\r\nthe pulmonary phthisis is supposed to be infectious.\r\n\r\nThis acidifying principle is found in all the metallic calces, as in lapis\r\ncalaminaris, which is a calciform ore of zinc; and in cerussa, which is a\r\ncalx of lead; two materials which are powerful in healing excoriations, and\r\nulcers, in a short time by their external application. How then does it\r\nhappen, that the oxygen in the atmosphere should prevent pulmonary ulcers\r\nfrom healing, and even induce them to spread wider; and yet in its\r\ncombination with metals, it should facilitate their healing? The healing of\r\nulcers consists in promoting the absorption of the fluids effused into\r\nthem, as treated of in Section XXXIII. 3. 2. Oxygen in combination with\r\nmetals, when applied in certain quantity, produces this effect by its\r\nstimulus; and the metallic oxydes not being decomposed by their contact\r\nwith animal matter, no new acid, or contagious material, is produced. So\r\nthat the combined oxygen, when applied to an ulcer, simply I suppose\r\npromotes absorption in it, like the application of other materials of the\r\narticles sorbentia or incitantia, if applied externally; as opium, bark,\r\nalum. But in the pulmonary ulcers, which cannot protect themselves from the\r\nair by forming a scab, the uncombined oxygen of the atmosphere unites with\r\nthe purulent matter, converting it into a contagious ichor; which by\r\ninfection, not by erosion, enlarges the ulcers, as in the itch or tinea;\r\nwhich might hence, according to Dr. Beddoes's ingenious theory of\r\nconsumption, be induced to heal, if exposed to an atmosphere deprived of a\r\npart of its oxygen. This I hope future experiments will confirm, and that\r\nthe pneumatic medicine will alleviate the evils of mankind in many other,\r\nas well as in this most fatal malady.\r\n\r\nM. M. First, the respiration of air lowered by an additional quantity of\r\nazote, or mixed with some proportion of hydrogen, or of carbonic acid air,\r\nmay be tried; as described in a late publication of Dr. Beddoes on the\r\nmedicinal use of factitious airs. Johnson, London. Or lastly, by breathing\r\na mixture of one tenth part of hydro-carbonate mixed with common air,\r\naccording to the discovery of Mr. Watt, which has a double advantage in\r\nthese cases, of diluting the oxygen of the atmospheric air, and inducing\r\nsickness, which increases pulmonary absorption, as mentioned below. An\r\natmosphere diluted with fixed air (carbonic acid) might be readily procured\r\nby setting tubs of new wort, or fermenting beer, in the parlour and\r\nlodging-room of the patient. For it is not acids floating in the air, but\r\nthe oxygen or acidifying principle, which injures or enlarges pulmonary\r\nulcers by combining with the purulent matter.\r\n\r\nAnother easy method of adding carbonic acid gas to the air of a room, would\r\nbe by means of an apparatus invented by Mr. Watt, and sold by Bolton and\r\nWatt at Birmingham, as described in Dr. Beddoes' Treatise on Pneumatic\r\nMedicine. Johnson, London. It consists of an iron pot, with an arm\r\nprojecting, and a method of letting water drop by slow degrees on chalk,\r\nwhich is to be put into the iron pot, and exposed to a moderate degree of\r\nheat over a common fire. By occasionally adding more and more chalk,\r\ncarbonic acid gas might be carried through a tin pipe from the arm of the\r\niron pot to any part of the room near the patient, or from an adjoining\r\nroom. In the same manner a diffusion of solution of flowers of zinc might\r\nbe produced and breathed by the patient, and would be likely much to\r\ncontribute to the healing of pulmonary ulcers; as observed by Mr. Watt. See\r\nthe treatise above mentioned.\r\n\r\nBreathing over the vapour of caustic volatile alkali might easily be\r\nmanaged for many hours in a day; which might neutralize the acid poison\r\nformed on pulmonary ulcers by the contact of oxygen, and thus prevent its\r\ndeleterious quality, as other acids become less caustic, when they are\r\nformed into neutral salts with alkalis. The volatile salt should be put\r\ninto a tin canister, with two pipes like horns from the top of it, one to\r\nsuck the air from, and the other to admit it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSecondly, the external ulcers in scrophulous habits are pale and flabby,\r\nand naturally disinclined to heal, the deposition of fluids in them being\r\ngreater than the absorption; these ulcers have their appearance immediately\r\nchanged by the external application of metallic calxes, and the medicines\r\nof the article Sorbentia, such as cerussa and the bark in fine powder, see\r\nClass I. 2. 3. 21. and are generally healed in a short time by these means.\r\nInduced by these observations, I wished to try the external application of\r\nsuch powders to ulcers in the lungs, and constructed a box with a\r\ncirculating brush in it, as described in the annexed plate; into this box\r\ntwo ounces of fine powder of Peruvian bark were put, and two drams of\r\ncerussa in fine powder; on whirling the central brush, part of this was\r\nraised into a cloud of powder, and the patient, applying his mouth to one\r\nof the tin pipes rising out of the box, inhaled this powder twice a day\r\ninto his lungs. I observed it did not produce any cough or uneasiness. This\r\npatient was in the last stage of consumption, and was soon tired of the\r\nexperiment, nor have I had such patients as I wished for the repetition of\r\nit. Perhaps a fine powder of manganese, or of the flowers of zinc, or of\r\nlapis calaminaris, might be thus applied to ulcers of the lungs with\r\ngreater advantage? Perhaps air impregnated with flowers of zinc in their\r\nmost comminuted state, might be a better way of applying this powder to the\r\nlungs, as discovered by Mr. Watt. See Dr. Beddoes on Pneumatic Medicine.\r\nJohnson.\r\n\r\nThirdly, as the healing of an ulcer consists in producing a tendency to\r\nabsorption on its surface greater than the deposition on it; see Sect.\r\nXXXIII. 3. 2. other modes of increasing pulmonary absorption, which are\r\nperhaps more manageable than the preceding ones, may be had recourse to;\r\nsuch as by producing frequent nausea or sickness. See Sect. XXIX. 5. 1. and\r\nArt. IV. 2. The great and sudden absorption of fluid from the lungs in the\r\nanasarca pulmonum by the sickness induced by the exhibition of digitalis,\r\nastonishes those who have not before attended to it, by emptying the\r\nswelled limbs, and removing the difficulty of breathing in a few hours.\r\n\r\nThe most manageable method of using digitalis is by making a saturated\r\ntincture of it, by infusing two ounces of the powder of the leaves in a\r\nmixture of four ounces of rectified spirit of wine, and four ounces of\r\nwater. Of this from 30 to 60 drops, or upwards, from a two-ounce phial, are\r\nto be taken twice in the morning part of the day, and to be so managed as\r\nnot to induce violent sickness. If sickness nevertheless comes on, the\r\npatient must for a day or two omit the medicine; and then begin it again in\r\nreduced doses.\r\n\r\nMr. ----, a young man about twenty, with dark eyes, and large pupils, who\r\nhad every symptom of pulmonary ulcers, I believed to have been cured by\r\ndigitalis, and published the case in the Transactions of the College, Vol.\r\nIII. But about two years afterwards I heard that he relapsed and died. Mr.\r\nL----, a corpulent man, who had for some weeks laboured under a cough with\r\ngreat expectoration, with quick pulse, and difficulty of breathing, soon\r\nrecovered by the use of digitalis taken twice a day; and though this case\r\nmight probably be a peripneumonia notha, or catarrh, it is here related as\r\nshewing the power of pulmonary absorption excited by the use of this drug.\r\n\r\nAnother method of inducing sickness, and pulmonary absorption in\r\nconsequence, is by sailing on the sea; by which many consumptive patients\r\nhave been said to have received their cure; which has been erroneously\r\nascribed to sea-air, instead of sea-sickness; whence many have been sent to\r\nbreathe the sea-air on the coasts, who might have done better in higher\r\nsituations, where the air probably contains less oxygen gas, which is the\r\nheaviest part of it. See a Letter from Dr. T. C. below.\r\n\r\nA third method of inducing sickness, and consequent pulmonary absorption,\r\nis by the vertigo occasioned by swinging; which has lately been introduced\r\ninto practice by Dr. Smith, (Essay on Pulmonary Consumption), who observed\r\nthat by swinging the hectic pulse became slower, which is explained in\r\nClass IV. 2. 1. 10. The usual way of reciprocating swinging, like the\r\noscillations of a pendulum, produces a degree of vertigo in those, who are\r\nunused to it; but to give it greater effect, the patient should be placed\r\nin a chair suspended from the ceiling by two parallel cords in contact with\r\neach other, the chair should then be forcibly revolved 20 or 40 times one\r\nway, and suffered to return spontaneously; which induces a degree of\r\nsickness in most adult people, and is well worthy an exact and pertinacious\r\ntrial, for an hour or two, three or four times a day for a month.\r\n\r\nThe common means of promoting absorption in ulcers, and of thickening the\r\nmatter in consequence, by taking the bark and opium internally, or by\r\nmetallic salts, as of mercury, steel, zinc, and copper, in small\r\nquantities, have been repeatedly used in pulmonary consumption; and may\r\nhave relieved some of the symptoms. As mercury cures venereal ulcers, and\r\nas pulmonary ulcers resemble them in their not having a disposition to\r\nheal, and in their tendency to enlarge themselves, there were hopes, from\r\nanalogy, that it might have succeeded. Would a solution of gold in aqua\r\nregia be worth trying? When vinegar is applied to the lips, it renders them\r\ninstantly pale, by promoting the venous absorption; if the whole skin was\r\nmoistened with warmish vinegar, would this promote venous absorption in the\r\nlungs by their sympathy with the skin? The very abstemious diet on milk and\r\nvegetables alone is frequently injurious. Flesh-meat once a day, with small\r\nwine and water, or small beer, is preferable. Half a grain of opium twice a\r\nday, or a grain, I believe to be of great use at the commencement of the\r\ndisease, as appears from the subsequent case.\r\n\r\nMiss ----, a delicate young lady, of a consumptive family, when she was\r\nabout eighteen, had frequent cough, with quick pulse, a pain of her side,\r\nand the general appearances of a beginning consumption. She took about five\r\ndrops of laudanum twice a day in a saline draught, which was increased\r\ngradually to ten. In a few weeks she recovered, was afterwards married,\r\nbore three or four children, and then became consumptive and died.\r\n\r\nThe following case of hereditary consumption is related by a physician of\r\ngreat ability and very extensive practice; and, as it is his own case,\r\nabounds with much nice observation and useful knowledge; and, as it has\r\nbeen attended with a favourable event, may give consolation to many, who\r\nare in a similar situation; and shews that Sydenham's recommendation of\r\nriding as a cure for consumption is not so totally ineffectual, as is now\r\ncommonly believed.\r\n\r\n    \"J. C. aged 27, with black hair, and a ruddy complexion, was subject to\r\n    cough from the age of puberty, and occasionally to spitting of blood.\r\n    His maternal grandfather died of consumption under thirty years of age,\r\n    and his mother fell a victim to this disease, with which she had long\r\n    been threatened, in her 43d year, and immediately after she ceased to\r\n    have children. In the severe winter of 1783-4, he was much afflicted\r\n    with cough; and being exposed to intense cold, in the month of February\r\n    he was seized with peripneumony. The disease was violent and dangerous,\r\n    and after repeated bleedings as well as blisterings, which he supported\r\n    with difficulty, in about six weeks he was able to leave his bed. At\r\n    this time the cough was severe, and the expectoration difficult. A\r\n    fixed pain remained on the left side, where an issue was inserted;\r\n    regular hectic came on every day about an hour after noon, and every\r\n    night heat and restlessness took place, succeeded towards morning by\r\n    general perspiration.\r\n\r\n    The patient, having formerly been subject to ague, was struck with the\r\n    resemblance of the febrile paroxysm, with what he had experienced under\r\n    that disease, and was willing to flatter himself it might be of the\r\n    same nature. He therefore took bark in the interval of fever, but with\r\n    an increase of his cough, and this requiring venesection, the blood was\r\n    found highly inflammatory. The vast quantity of blood which he had lost\r\n    from time to time, produced a disposition to fainting, when he resumed\r\n    the upright posture, and he was therefore obliged to remain almost\r\n    constantly in a recumbent position. Attempting to ride out in a\r\n    carriage, he was surprised to find that he could sit upright for a\r\n    considerable time, while in motion, without inconvenience, though, on\r\n    stopping the carriage, the disposition to fainting returned.\r\n\r\n    At this time, having prolonged his ride beyond the usual length, he one\r\n    day got into an uneven road at the usual period of the recurrence of\r\n    the hectic paroxysms, and that day he missed it altogether. This\r\n    circumstance led him to ride out daily in a carriage at the time the\r\n    febrile accession might be expected, and sometimes by this means it was\r\n    prevented, sometimes deferred, and almost always mitigated.\r\n\r\n    This experience determined him to undertake a journey of some length,\r\n    and Bristol being, as is usual in such cases, recommended, he set out\r\n    on the 19th of April, and arrived there on the 2d of May. During the\r\n    greater part of this journey (of 175 miles) his cough was severe, and\r\n    being obliged to be bled three different times on the road, he was no\r\n    longer able to sit upright, but at very short intervals, and was\r\n    obliged to lie at length in the diagonal of a coach. The hectic\r\n    paroxysms were not interrupted during the journey, but they were\r\n    irregular and indistinct, and the salutary effects of exercise, or\r\n    rather of gestation, were impressed on the patient's mind.\r\n\r\n    At Bristol he stayed a month, but reaped no benefit. The weather was\r\n    dry and the roads dusty; the water insipid and inert. He attempted to\r\n    ride on horseback on the downs, but was not able to bear the fatigue\r\n    for a distance of more than a hundred yards. The necessity of frequent\r\n    bleedings kept down his strength, and his hectic paroxysms continued,\r\n    though less severe. At this time, suspecting that his cough was\r\n    irritated by the west-winds bearing the vapour from the sea, he\r\n    resolved to try the effects of an inland situation, and set off for\r\n    Matlock in Derbyshire.\r\n\r\n    During the journey he did not find the improvement he expected, but the\r\n    nightly perspirations began to diminish; and the extraordinary fatigue\r\n    he experienced proceeded evidently from his travelling in a\r\n    post-chaise, where he could not indulge in a recumbent position. The\r\n    weather at Bristol had been hot, and the earth arid and dusty. At\r\n    Matlock, during the month of June 1784, there was almost a perpetual\r\n    drizzle, the soil was wet, and the air moist and cold. Here, however,\r\n    the patient's cough began to abate, and at intervals he found an\r\n    opportunity of riding more or less on horseback. From two or three\r\n    hundred yards at a time, he got to ride a mile without stopping; and at\r\n    length he was able to sit on horseback during a ride from Mason's Bath\r\n    to the village of Matlock along the Derwent, and round on the opposite\r\n    banks, by the works of Mr. Arkwright, back to the house whence he\r\n    started, a distance of five miles. On dismounting, however, he was\r\n    seized with diliquium, and soon after the strength he had recovered was\r\n    lost by an attack of the hæmorrhoids of the most painful kind, and\r\n    requiring much loss of blood from the parts affected.\r\n\r\n    On reflection, it appeared that the only benefit received by the\r\n    patient was during motion, and continued motion could better be\r\n    obtained in the course of a journey than during his residence at any\r\n    particular place. This, and other circumstances of a private but\r\n    painful nature, determined him to set out from Matlock on a journey to\r\n    Scotland. The weather was now much improved, and during the journey he\r\n    recruited his strength. Though as yet he could not sit upright at rest\r\n    for half an hour together without a disposition to giddiness, dimness\r\n    of sight, and deliquium, he was able to sit upright under the motion of\r\n    a post-chaise during a journey of from 40 to 70 miles daily, and his\r\n    appetite began to improve. Still his cough continued, and his hectic\r\n    flushings, though the chills were much abated and very irregular.\r\n\r\n    The salutary effects of motion being now more striking than ever, he\r\n    purchased a horse admirably adapted to a valetudinarian in\r\n    Dumfriesshire, and being now able to sit on horseback for an hour\r\n    together, he rode out several times a day. He fixed his residence for a\r\n    few weeks at Moffat, a village at the foot of the mountains whence the\r\n    Tweed, the Clyde, and the Annan, descend in different directions; a\r\n    situation inland, dry, and healthy, and elevated about three hundred\r\n    feet above the surface of the sea. Here his strength recovered daily,\r\n    and he began to eat animal food, which for several months before he had\r\n    not tasted. Persevering in exercise on horseback, he gradually\r\n    increased the length of his rides, according to his strength, from four\r\n    to twenty miles a day; and returning on horseback to Lancashire by the\r\n    lakes of Cumberland, he arrived at Liverpool on the first of September,\r\n    having rode the last day of his journey forty miles.\r\n\r\n    The two inferences of most importance to be drawn from this narrative,\r\n    are, first, the extraordinary benefit derived from gestation in a\r\n    carriage, and still more the mixture of gestation and exercise on\r\n    horseback, in arresting or mitigating the hectic paroxysm; and\r\n    secondly, that in the florid consumption, as Dr. Beddoes terms it, an\r\n    elevated and inland air is in certain circumstances peculiarly\r\n    salutary; while an atmosphere loaded with the spray of the sea is\r\n    irritating and noxious. The benefit derived in this case from exercise\r\n    on horseback, may lead us to doubt whether Sydenham's praise of this\r\n    remedy be as much exaggerated as it has of late been supposed. Since\r\n    the publication of Dr. C. Smyth on the effects of swinging in lowering\r\n    the pulse in the hectic paroxysm, the subject of this narrative has\r\n    repeated his experiments in a great variety of cases, and has confirmed\r\n    them. He has also repeatedly seen the hectic paroxysm prevented, or cut\r\n    short, by external ablution of the naked body with tepid water.\r\n\r\n    So much was his power of digestion impaired or vitiated by the immense\r\n    evacuations, and the long continued debility he underwent, that after\r\n    the cough was removed, and indeed for several years after the period\r\n    mentioned, he never could eat animal food without heat and flushing,\r\n    with frequent pulse and extreme drowsiness. If this drowsiness was\r\n    encouraged, the fever ran high, and he awoke from disturbed sleep,\r\n    wearied and depressed. If it was resolutely resisted by gentle\r\n    exercise, it went off in about an hour, as well as the increased\r\n    frequency of the pulse. This agitation was however such as to\r\n    incapacitate him during the afternoon for study of any kind. The same\r\n    effects did not follow a meal of milk and vegetables, but under this\r\n    diet his strength did not recruit; whereas after the use of animal food\r\n    it recovered rapidly, notwithstanding the inconvenience already\r\n    mentioned. For this inconvenience he at last found a remedy in the use\r\n    of coffee immediately after dinner, recommended to him by his friend\r\n    Dr. Percival. At first this remedy operated like a charm, but by\r\n    frequent use, and indeed by abuse, it no longer possesses its original\r\n    efficacy.\r\n\r\n    Dr. Falconer, in his Dissertation on the Influence of the Passions and\r\n    Affections of the Mind on Health and Disease, supposes that the\r\n    cheerfulness which attends hectic fever, the ever-springing hope, which\r\n    brightens the gloom of the consumptive patient, increases the diseased\r\n    actions, and hastens his doom. And hence he is led to enquire, whether\r\n    the influence of fear might not be substituted in such cases to that of\r\n    hope with advantage to the patient? This question I shall not presume\r\n    to answer, but it leads me to say something of the state of the mind in\r\n    the case just related.\r\n\r\n    The patient, being a physician, was not ignorant of his danger, which,\r\n    some melancholy circumstances served to impress on his mind. It has\r\n    already been mentioned, that his mother and grandfather died of this\r\n    disease. It may be added, that in the year preceding that on which he\r\n    himself was attacked, a sister of his was carried off by consumption in\r\n    her 17th year; that in the same winter in which he fell ill, two other\r\n    sisters were seized with the same fatal disorder, to which one of them\r\n    fell a victim during his residence at Bristol, and that the hope of\r\n    bidding a last adieu to the other was the immediate cause of his\r\n    journey to Scotland, a hope which, alas! was indulged in vain. The day\r\n    on which he reached the end of his journey, her remains were committed\r\n    to the dust! It may be conjectured from these circumstances, that\r\n    whatever benefit may be derived from the apprehension of death, must in\r\n    this case have been obtained. The expectation of this issue was indeed\r\n    for some time so fixed that it ceased to produce much agitation; in\r\n    conformity to that general law of our nature, by which almost all men\r\n    submit with composure to a fate that is foreseen, and that appears\r\n    inevitable. As however the progress of disease and debility seemed to\r\n    be arrested, the hope and the love of life revived, and produced, from\r\n    time to time, the observations and the exertions already mentioned.\r\n\r\n    Wine and beer were rigorously abstained from during six months of the\r\n    above history; and all the blood which was taken was even to the last\r\n    buffy.\" Feb. 3, 1795.\r\n\r\n8. _Febris scrophulosa._ The hectic fever occasioned by ulcers of the\r\nlymphatic glands, when exposed to the air, does not differ from that\r\nattending pulmonary consumption, being accompanied with night-sweats and\r\noccasional diarrhoea.\r\n\r\nM. M. The bark. Opium internally. Externally cerussa and bark in fine\r\npowder. Bandage. Sea-bathing. See Class I. 2. 3. 21. and II. 1. 4. 13.\r\n\r\n9. _Febris ischiadica._ A hectic fever from an open ulcer between the\r\nmuscles of the pelvis, which differs not from the preceding. If the matter\r\nin this situation lodges till part of it, I suppose, becomes putrid, and\r\naerates the other part; or till it becomes absorbed from some other\r\ncircumstance; a similar hectic fever is produced, with night-sweats, or\r\ndiarrhoea.\r\n\r\nMrs. ----, after a lying in, had pain on one side of her loins, which\r\nextended to the internal part of the thigh on the same side. No fluctuation\r\nof matter could be felt; she became hectic with copious night-sweats, and\r\noccasional diarrhoea, for four or five weeks; and recovered by, I suppose,\r\nthe total absorption of the matter, and the reunion of the walls of the\r\nabscess. See Class II. 1. 2. 18.\r\n\r\n10. _Febris Arthropuodica._ Fever from the matter of diseased joints. Does\r\nthe matter from suppurating bones, which generally has a very putrid smell,\r\nproduce hectic fever, or typhus? See Class II. 1. 4. 16.\r\n\r\n11. _Febris a pure contagioso._ Fever from contagious pus. When the\r\ncontagious matters have been produced on the external habit, and in process\r\nof time become absorbed, a fever is produced in consequence of this\r\nreabsorption; which differs with the previous irritability or\r\ninirritability, as well as with the sensibility of the patient.\r\n\r\n12. _Febris variolosa secundaria._ Secondary fever of small-pox. In the\r\ndistinct small-pox the fever is of the sensitive irritated or inflammatory\r\nkind; in the confluent small-pox it is of the sensitive inirritated kind,\r\nor typhus gravior. In both of them the swelling of the face, when the\r\nmatter there begins to be absorbed, and of the hands, when the matter there\r\nbegins to be absorbed, shew, that it stimulates the capillary vessels or\r\nglands, occasioning an increased secretion greater than the absorbents can\r\ntake up, like the action of the cantharides in a blister; now as the\r\napplication of a blister on the skin frequently occasions the strangury,\r\nwhich shews, that some part of the cantharides is absorbed; there is reason\r\nto conclude, that a part of the matter of small-pox is absorbed, and thus\r\nproduces the secondary fever. See Class II. 1. 3. 9. And not simply by its\r\nstimulus on the surface of the ulcers beneath the scabs. The exsudation of\r\na yellow fluid from beneath the confluent eruptions on the face before the\r\nheight is spoken of in Class II. 1. 3. 2.\r\n\r\nThe material thus absorbed in the secondary fever of small-pox differs from\r\nthat of open ulcers, as it is only aerated through the elevated cuticle;\r\nand secondly, because there is not a constant supply of fresh matter, when\r\nthat already in the pustules is exhausted, either by absorption, or by\r\nevaporation, or by its induration into a scab. Might not the covering the\r\nface assiduously and exactly with plasters, as with cerate of calamy, or\r\nwith minium plaster, by precluding the air from the pustules, prevent their\r\ncontracting a contagious, or acescent, or fever-producing power? and the\r\nsecondary fever be thus prevented entirely. If the matter in those pustules\r\non the face in the confluent small-pox were thus prevented from\r\noxygenation, it is highly probable, both from this theory, and from the\r\nfacts before mentioned, that the matter would not erode the skin beneath\r\nthem, and by these means no marks or scars would succeed.\r\n\r\n13. _Febris carcinomatosa._ Fever from the matter of cancer. In a late\r\npublication the pain is said to be relieved, and the fever cured, and the\r\ncancer eradicated, by the application of carbonic acid gas, or fixed air.\r\nSee Class II. 1. 4. 16.\r\n\r\n14. _Febris venerea._ From the absorption of the matter from venereal\r\nulcers and suppurating bones. See Syphilis, II. 1. 5. 2.\r\n\r\nM. M. Any mercurial calx. Sarsaparilla? Mezereon?\r\n\r\n15. _Febris a sanie putrida._ Fever from putrid sanies. When parts of the\r\nbody are destroyed by external violence, as a bruise, or by mortification,\r\na putrefaction soon succeeds; as they are kept in that degree of warmth and\r\nmoisture by their adhesion to the living parts of the body, which most\r\nforwards that process. Thus the sloughs of mortified parts of the tonsils\r\ngive fetor to the breath in some fevers; the matter from putrefying teeth,\r\nor other suppurating bones, is particularly offensive; and even the scurf,\r\nwhich adheres to the tongue, frequently acquires a bitter taste from its\r\nincipient putridity. This material differs from those before mentioned, as\r\nits deleterious property depends on a chemical rather than an animal\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\n16. _Febris puerpera._ Puerperal fever. It appears from some late\r\ndissections, which have been published, of those women who have died of the\r\npuerperal fever, that matter has been formed in the omentum, and found in\r\nthe cavity of the abdomen, with some blood or sanies. These parts are\r\nsupposed to have been injured by the exertions accompanying labour; and as\r\nmatter in this viscus may have been produced without much pain, this\r\ndisease is not attended with arterial strength and hard full pulse like the\r\ninflammation of the uterus; and as the fever is of the inirritative or\r\ntyphus kind, there is reason to believe, that the previous exhaustion of\r\nthe patient during labour may contribute to its production; as well as the\r\nabsorption of a material not purulent but putrid; which is formed by the\r\ndelay of extravasated or dead matter produced by the bruises of the\r\nomentum, or other viscera, in the efforts of parturition, rather than by\r\npurulent matter, the consequence of suppuration. The pulse is generally\r\nabout 120 when in bed and in the morning; and is increased to 134, or more,\r\nwhen the patient sits up, or in the evening paroxysm. The pulse of all very\r\nweak patients increases in frequency when they sit up; because the\r\nexpenditure of sensorial power necessary to preserve an erect posture\r\ndeducts so much from their general strength; and hence the pulse becomes\r\nweaker, and in consequence quicker. See Sect. XII. 1. 4.\r\n\r\nIn this fever time must be allowed for the absorption of the matter. Very\r\nlarge and repeated quantities of the bark, by preventing sufficient food\r\nfrom being taken, as bread, and wine, and water, I have thought has much\r\ninjured the patient; for the bark is not here given as in intermittent\r\nfevers to prevent the paroxysm, but simply to strengthen the patient by\r\nincreasing the power of digestion. About two ounces of decoction of bark,\r\nwith four drops of laudanum, and a dram of sweet spirit of vitriol, once in\r\nsix hours, and a glass of wine between those times, with panada, or other\r\nfood, I have thought of most advantage, with a small blister occasionally.\r\n\r\nWhere not only the stomach but also the bowels are much distended with air,\r\nso as to sound on striking them with the fingers, the case is always\r\ndangerous, generally hopeless; which is more so in proportion to the\r\nquickness of the pulse. Where the bowels are distended two drops of oil of\r\ncinnamon should be given in the panada three or four times a day.\r\n\r\n17. _Febris a sphacelo._ Fever from mortification. This fever from\r\nabsorption of putrid matter is of the inirritative or typhus kind. See the\r\npreceding article.\r\n\r\nM. M. Opium and the bark are frequently given in too great quantity, so as\r\nto induce consequent debility, and to oppress the power of digestion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nORDO I.\r\n\r\n_Increased Sensation._\r\n\r\nGENUS VII.\r\n\r\n_With increased Action of the Organs of Sense._\r\n\r\nSPECIES.\r\n\r\n1. _Delirium febrile._ Paraphrosyne. The ideas in delirium consist of those\r\nexcited by the sensation of pleasure or pain, which precedes them, and the\r\ntrains of other ideas associated with these, and not of those excited by\r\nexternal irritations or by voluntary exertion. Hence the patients do not\r\nknow the room which they inhabit, or the people who surround them; nor have\r\nthey any voluntary exertion, where the delirium is complete; so that their\r\nefforts in walking about a room or rising from their bed are unsteady, and\r\nproduced by their catenations with the immediate affections of pleasure or\r\npain. See Section XXXIII. 1. 4.\r\n\r\nBy the above circumstances it is distinguished from madness, in which the\r\npatients well know the persons of their acquaintance, and the place where\r\nthey are; and perform all the voluntary actions with steadiness and\r\ndetermination. See Sect. XXXIV. 2. 2.\r\n\r\nDelirium is sometimes less complete, and then a new face and louder voice\r\nstimulate the patient to attend to them for a few moments; and then they\r\nrelapse again into perfect delirium. At other times a delirium affects but\r\none sense, and the person thinks he sees things which do not exist; and is\r\nat the same time sensible to the questions which are asked him, and to the\r\ntaste of the food which is offered to him.\r\n\r\nThis partial delirium is termed an hallucination of the disordered organ;\r\nand may probably arise from the origin of one nerve of sense being more\r\nliable to inflammation than the others; that is, an exuberance of the\r\nsensorial power of sensation may affect it; which is therefore thrown into\r\naction by slighter sensitive catenations, without being obedient to\r\nexternal stimulus, or to the power of volition.\r\n\r\nThe perpetual flow of ideas in delirium is owing to the same circumstance,\r\nas of those in our dreams; namely, to the defect or paralysis of the\r\nvoluntary power; as in hemiplagia, when one side of the body is paralytic,\r\nand thus expends less of the sensorial power, the limbs on the other side\r\nare in constant motion from the exuberance of it. Whence less sensorial\r\npower is exhausted in delirium, than at other times, as well as in sleep;\r\nand hence in fevers with great debility, it is perhaps, as well as the\r\nstupor, rather a favourable circumstance; and when removed by numerous\r\nblisters, the death of the patient often follows the recovery of his\r\nunderstanding. See Class I. 2. 5. 6. and I. 2. 5. 10.\r\n\r\nDelirium in diseases from inirritability is sometimes preceded by a\r\npropensity to surprise. See Class I. 1. 5. 11.\r\n\r\nM. M. Fomentations of the shaved head for an hour repeatedly. A blister on\r\nthe head. Rising from bed. Wine and opium, and sometimes venesection in\r\nsmall quantity by cupping, if the strength of the arterial system will\r\nallow it.\r\n\r\n2. _Delirium maniacale._ Maniacal delirium. There is another kind of\r\ndelirium, described in Sect. XXXIII. 1. 4. which has the increase of\r\npleasureable or painful sensation for its cause, without any diminution of\r\nthe other sensorial powers; but as this excites the patient to the exertion\r\nof voluntary actions, for the purpose of obtaining the object of his\r\npleasureable ideas, or avoiding the object of his painful ones, such as\r\nperpetual prayer, when it is of the religious kind, it belongs to the\r\ninsanities described in Class III. 1. 2. 1, and is more properly termed\r\nhallucinatio maniacalis.\r\n\r\n3. _Dilirium ebrietatis._ The drunken delirium is in nothing different from\r\nthe delirium attending fevers except in its cause, as from alcohol, or\r\nother poisons. When it is attended with an apoplectic stupor, the pulse is\r\ngenerally low; and venesection I believe sometimes destroys those, who\r\nwould otherwise have recovered in a few hours.\r\n\r\nM. M. Diluting liquids. An emetic.\r\n\r\n4. _Somnium._ Dreams constitute the most complete kind of delirium. As in\r\nthese no external irritations are attended to, and the power of volition is\r\nentirely suspended; so that the sensations of pleasure and pain, with their\r\nassociations, alone excite the endless trains of our sleeping ideas; as\r\nexplained in Sect. XVIII. on Sleep.\r\n\r\n5. _Hallucinatio visûs._ Deception of sight. These visual hallucinations\r\nare perpetual in our dreams; and sometimes precede general delirium in\r\nfevers; and sometimes belong to reverie, and to insanity. See Class III. 1.\r\n2. 1. and 2. and must be treated accordingly.\r\n\r\nOther kinds of visual hallucinations occur by moon-light; when objects are\r\nnot seen so distinctly as to produce the usual ideas associated with them,\r\nbut appear to us exactly as they are seen. Thus the trunk of a tree appears\r\na flat surface, instead of a cylinder as by day, and we are deceived and\r\nalarmed by seeing things as they really are seen. See Berkley on Vision.\r\n\r\n6. _Hallucinatio auditûs._ Auricular deception frequently occurs in dreams,\r\nand sometimes precedes general delirium in fevers; and sometimes belongs to\r\nvertigo, and to reverie, and to insanity. See Sect. XX. 7. and Class III.\r\n1. 2. 1. and 2.\r\n\r\n7. _Rubor a calore._ The blush from heat is occasioned by the increased\r\naction of the cutaneous vessels in consequence of the increased sensation\r\nof heat. See Class I. 1. 2. 1. and 3.\r\n\r\n8. _Rubor jucunditatis._ The blush of joy is owing to the increased action\r\nof the capillary arteries, along with that of every moving vessel in the\r\nbody, from the increase of pleasurable sensation.\r\n\r\n9. _Priapismus amatorius._ Amatorial priapism. The blood is poured into the\r\ncells of the corpora cavernosa much faster than it can be reabsorbed by the\r\nvena penis, owing in this case to the pleasurable sensation of love\r\nincreasing the arterial action. See Class I. 1. 4. 6.\r\n\r\n10. _Distentio mamularum._ The teats of female animals, when they give\r\nsuck, become rigid and erected, in the same manner as in the last article,\r\nfrom the pleasurable sensation of the love of the mother to her offspring.\r\nWhence the teat may properly be called an organ of sense. The nipples of\r\nmen do the same when rubbed with the hand. See Class I. 1. 4. 7.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nORDO II.\r\n\r\n_Decreased Sensation._\r\n\r\nGENUS I.\r\n\r\n_Of the General System._\r\n\r\nSPECIES.\r\n\r\n1. _Stultitia insensibilis._ Folly from insensibility. The pleasure or pain\r\ngenerated in the system is not sufficient to promote the usual activity\r\neither of the sensual or muscular fibres.\r\n\r\n2. _Tædium vitæ._ Ennui. Irksomeness of life. The pain of laziness has been\r\nthought by some philosophers to be that principle of action, which has\r\nexcited all our industry, and distinguished mankind from the brutes of the\r\nfield. It is certain that, where the ennui exists, it is relieved by the\r\nexertions of our minds or bodies, as all other painful sensations are\r\nrelieved; but it depends much upon our early habits, whether we become\r\npatient of laziness, or inclined to activity, during the remainder of our\r\nlives, as other animals do not appear to be affected with this malady;\r\nwhich is perhaps left owing to deficiency of pleasurable sensation, than to\r\nthe superabundancy of voluntary power, which occasions pain in the muscles\r\nby its accumulation; as appears from the perpetual motions of a squirrel\r\nconfined in a cage.\r\n\r\n3. _Paresis sensitiva._ Weakness of the whole system from insensibility.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nORDO II.\r\n\r\n_Decreased Sensation._\r\n\r\nGENUS II.\r\n\r\n_Of Particular Organs._\r\n\r\nSPECIES.\r\n\r\n1. _Anorexia._ Want of appetite. Some elderly people, and those debilitated\r\nby fermented liquors, are liable to lose their appetite for animal food;\r\nwhich is probably in part owing to the deficiency of gastric acid, as well\r\nas to the general decay of the system: elderly people will go on years\r\nwithout animal food; but inebriates soon sink, when their digestion becomes\r\nso far impaired. Want of appetite is sometimes produced by the putrid\r\nmatter from many decaying teeth being perpetually mixed with the saliva,\r\nand thence affecting the organ of taste, and greatly injuring the\r\ndigestion.\r\n\r\nM. M. Fine charcoal powder diffused in warm water held in the mouth\r\nfrequently in a day, as in Class I. 2. 4. 12. or solution of alum in water.\r\nExtract the decayed teeth. An emetic. A blister. Chalybeates. Vitriolic\r\nacid. Bile of an ox inspissated, and made into pills; 20 grains to be taken\r\nbefore dinner and supper. Opium half a grain twice a day.\r\n\r\nAll the strength we possess is ultimately derived from the food, which we\r\nare able to digest; whence a total debility of the system frequently\r\nfollows the want of appetite, and of the power of digestion. Some young\r\nladies I have observed to fall into this general debility, so as but just\r\nto be able to walk about; which I have sometimes ascribed to their\r\nvoluntary fasting, when they believed themselves too plump; and who have\r\nthus lost both their health and beauty by too great abstinence, which could\r\nnever be restored.\r\n\r\nI have seen other cases of what may be termed anorexia epileptica, in which\r\na total loss of appetite, and of the power of digestion, suddenly occurred\r\nalong with epileptic fits. Miss B. a girl about eighteen, apparently very\r\nhealthy, and rather plump, was seized with fits, which were at first called\r\nhysterical; they occurred at the end of menstruation, and returned very\r\nfrequently with total loss of appetite. She was relieved by venesection,\r\nblisters, and opiates; her strength diminished, and after some returns of\r\nthe fits, she took to her bed, and has survived 15 or 20 years; she has in\r\ngeneral eaten half a potato a day, and seldom speaks, but retains her\r\nsenses, and had many years occasional returns of convulsion. I have seen\r\ntwo similar cases, where the anorexia, or want of appetite, was in less\r\ndegree; and but just so much food could be digested, as supplied them with\r\nsufficient strength to keep from the bed or sofa for half the day. As well\r\nas I can recollect, all these patients were attended with weak pulse, and\r\ncold pale skin; and received benefit by opium, from a quarter of a grain to\r\na grain four times a day. See Class III. 1. 1. 7. and III. 1. 2. 1. and\r\nIII. 1. 2. 20.\r\n\r\n2. _Adipsia._ Want of thirst. Several of the inferior people, as farmers\r\nwives, have a habit of not drinking with their dinner at all, or only take\r\na spoonful or two of ale after it. I have frequently observed these to\r\nlabour under bad digestion, and debility in consequence; which I have\r\nascribed to the too great stimulus of solid food undiluted, destroying in\r\nprocess of time the irritability of the stomach.\r\n\r\n3. _Impotentia_ (agenesia). Impotency much seldomer happens to the male sex\r\nthan sterility to the female sex. Sometimes a temporary impotence occurs\r\nfrom bashfulness, or the interference of some voluntary exertion in the\r\nproduction of an effect, which should be performed alone by pleasurable\r\nsensation.\r\n\r\nOne, who was soon to be married to a lady of superior condition to his own,\r\nexpressed fear of not succeeding on the wedding night; he was advised to\r\ntake a grain of opium before he went to bed, and to accustom himself to\r\nsleep with a woman previously, but not to enjoy her, to take off his\r\nbashfulness; which succeeded to his wish.\r\n\r\nM. M. Chalybeates. Opium. Bark. Tincture of cantharides.\r\n\r\n4. _Sterilitas._ Barrenness. One of the ancient medical writers asserts,\r\nthat the female sex become pregnant with most certainty at or near the time\r\nof menstruation. This is not improbable, since these monthly periods seem\r\nto referable the monthly venereal orgasm of some female quadrupeds, which\r\nbecome pregnant at those times only; and hence the computation of pregnancy\r\nis not often erroneous, though taken from the last menstruation. See\r\nSection XXXVI. 2. 3.\r\n\r\nM. M. Opium a grain every night. Chalybeates in very small doses. Bark.\r\nSea-bathing.\r\n\r\n5. _Insensibilitas artuum._ As in some paralytic limbs. A great\r\ninsensibility sometimes accompanies the torpor of the skin in cold fits of\r\nagues. Some parts have retained the sense of heat, but not the sense of\r\ntouch. See Sect. XVI. 6.\r\n\r\nM. M. Friction with flannel. A blister. Warmth.\r\n\r\n6. _Dysuria insensitiva._ Insensibility of the bladder. A difficulty or\r\ntotal inability to make water attends some fevers with great debility,\r\nowing to the insensibility or inirritability of the bladder. This is a\r\ndangerous but not always a fatal symptom.\r\n\r\nM. M. Draw off the water with a catheter. Assist the patient in the\r\nexclusion of it by compressing the lower parts of the abdomen with the\r\nhands. Wine two ounces, Peruvian bark one dram in decoction, every three\r\nhours alternately. Balsam of copaiva. Oil of almonds, with as much camphor\r\nas can be dissolved in it, applied as a liniment rubbed on the region of\r\nthe bladder and perinæum, and repeated every four hours, was used in this\r\ndisease with success by Mr. Latham. Med. Comment. 1791, p. 213.\r\n\r\n7. _Accumulatio alvina._ An accumulation of feces in the rectum, occasioned\r\nby the torpor, or insensibility, of that bowel. But as liquids pass by\r\nthese accumulations, it differs from the constipatio alvi, which is owing\r\nto too great absorption of the alimentary canal.\r\n\r\nOld milk, and especially when boiled, is liable to induce this kind of\r\ncostiveness in some grown persons; which is probably owing to their not\r\npossessing sufficient gastric acid to curdle and digest it; for as both\r\nthese processes require gastric acid, it follows, that a greater quantity\r\nof it is necessary, than in the digestion of other aliments, which do not\r\npreviously require being curdled. This ill digested milk not sufficiently\r\nstimulating the rectum, remains till it becomes a too solid mass. On this\r\naccount milk seldom agrees with those, who are subject to piles, by\r\ninducing costiveness and large stools.\r\n\r\nM. M. Extract the hardened scybala by means of a marrow-spoon; or by a\r\npiece of wire, or of whale-bone bent into a bow, and introduced. Injections\r\nof oil. Castor oil, or oil of almonds, taken by the mouth. A large clyster\r\nof smoak of tobacco. Six grains of rhubarb taken every night for many\r\nmonths. Aloes. An endeavour to establish a habit of evacuation at a certain\r\nhour daily.

Class I. 3. 1. 1.\r\n\r\nSPECIES.\r\n\r\n1. _Ureterum motus retrogressus._ When a stone has advanced into the ureter\r\nfrom the pelvis of the kidney, it is sometimes liable to be returned by the\r\nretrograde motion of that canal, and the patient obtains fallacious ease,\r\ntill the stone is again pushed into the ureter.\r\n\r\n2. _Urethræ motus retrogressus._ There have been instances of bougies being\r\ncarried up the urethra into the bladder most probably by an inverted motion\r\nof this canal; for which some have undergone an operation similar to that\r\nfor the extraction of a stone. A case is related in some medical\r\npublication, in which a catgut bougie was carried into the bladder, and\r\nafter remaining many weeks, was voided piece-meal in a semi-dissolved\r\nstate. Another case is related of a French officer, who used a leaden\r\nbougie; which at length found its way into the bladder, and was, by\r\ninjecting crude mercury, amalgamated and voided.\r\n\r\nIn the same manner the infection from a simple gonorrhoea is probably\r\ncarried further along the course of the urethra; and small stones\r\nfrequently descend some way into the urethra, and are again carried up into\r\nthe bladder by the inverted action of this canal.\r\n\r\n3. _Ductus choledochi motus retrogressus._ The concretions of bile, called\r\ngall-stones, frequently enter the bile-duct, and give violent pain for some\r\nhours; and return again into the gall-bladder, by the retrograde action of\r\nthis duct. May not oil be carried up this duct, when a gall-stone gives\r\ngreat pain, by its retrograde spasmodic action? See Class I. 1. 3. 8.\r\n\r\nM. M.

(Sect. IV. 5.) Both which circumstances seem to originate from\r\nthe accumulation of sensorial power in the affected organ. Thus when the\r\nskin is exposed to great cold, the activity of the cutaneous vessels is\r\ndiminished, and in consequence an accumulation of sensorial power obtains\r\nin them, because they are usually excited into incessant motion by the\r\nstimulus of heat, as explained in Sect. XII. 5. 2. Contrarywise, when the\r\nvessels of the skin are exposed to great heat, an excess of sensorial power\r\nis also produced in them, which is derived thither by the increase of\r\nstimulus above what is natural.\r\n\r\nThis accounts for the relief which is received in all kinds of pain by any\r\nviolent exertions of our muscles or organs of sense; which may thus be in\r\npart ascribed to the exhaustion of the sensorial power by such exertions.\r\nBut this relief is in many cases so instantaneous, that it seems\r\nnevertheless probable, that it is also in part owing to the different\r\nmanner of progression of the two sensorial powers of sensation and\r\nvolition; one of them commencing at some extremity of the sensorium, and\r\nbeing propagated towards the central parts of it; and the other commencing\r\nin the central parts of the sensorium, and being propagated towards the\r\nextremities of it; as mentioned in Sect. XI. 2. 1.\r\n\r\nThese violent voluntary exertions of our muscles or ideas to relieve the\r\nsensation of pain constitute convulsions and madness; and are distinguished\r\nfrom the muscular actions owing to increased sensation, as in sneezing, or\r\ncoughing, or parturition, or ejectio feminis, because they do not\r\ncontribute to dislodge the cause, but only to prevent the sensation of it.\r\nIn two cases of parturition, both of young women with their first child, I\r\nhave seen general convulsions occur from excess of voluntary exertion, as\r\nabove described, instead of the actions of particular muscles, which ought\r\nto have been excited by sensation for the exclusion of the fetus. They both\r\nbecame insensible, and died after some hours; from one of them the fetus\r\nwas extracted in vain. I have heard also of general convulsions being\r\nexcited instead of the actions of the musculi acceleratores in the ejectio\r\nfeminis, which terminated fatally. See Class III. 1. 1. 7.\r\n\r\nThese violent exertions are most frequently excited in consequence of those\r\npains, which originate from defect of the action of the part. See Sect.\r\nXXXIV. 1. and 2. The pains from excess and defect of the action of the part\r\nare distinguishable from each other by the former being attended with\r\nincrease of heat in the pained part, or of the whole body; while the latter\r\nnot only exist without increase of heat in the pained part, but are\r\ngenerally attended with coldness of the extremities of the body.\r\n\r\nAs soon as these violent actions of our muscular or sensual fibres for the\r\npurpose of relieving pain cease to be exerted, the pain recurs; whence the\r\nreciprocal contraction and relaxation of the muscles in convulsion, and the\r\nintervals of madness. Otherwise these violent exertions continue, till so\r\ngreat a part of the sensorial power is exhausted, that no more of it is\r\nexcitable by the faculty of volition; and a temporary apoplexy succeeds,\r\nwith snoring as in profound sleep; which so generally terminates epileptic\r\nfits.\r\n\r\nWhen these voluntary exertions become so connected with certain\r\ndisagreeable sensations, or with irritations, that the effort of the will\r\ncannot restrain them, they can no longer in common language be termed\r\nvoluntary; but nevertheless belong to this class, as they are produced by\r\nexcess of volition, and may still not improperly be called depraved\r\nvoluntary actions. See Sect. XXXIV. 1. where many motions in common\r\nlanguage termed involuntary are shewn to depend on excess of volition.\r\n\r\nWhen these exertions from excess of volition, which in common language are\r\ntermed involuntary motions, either of mind or body, are perpetually exerted\r\nin weak constitutions, the pulse becomes quick; which is occasioned by the\r\ntoo great expenditure of the sensorial power in these unceasing modes of\r\nactivity. In the same manner as in very weak people in fevers, the pulse\r\nsometimes increases in frequency to 140 strokes in a minute, when the\r\npatients stand up or endeavour to walk; and subsides to 110, when they lie\r\ndown again in their beds. Whence it appears, that when a very quick pulse\r\naccompanies convulsion or insanity, it simply indicates the weakness of the\r\npatient; that is, that the expenditure of sensorial power is too great for\r\nthe supply of it. But if the strength of the patient is not previously\r\nexhausted, the exertions of the muscles are attended with temporary\r\nincrease of circulation, the reciprocal swellings and elongations of their\r\nbellies push forwards the arterial blood, and promote the absorption of the\r\nvenous blood; whence a temporary increase of secretion and of heat, and a\r\nstronger pulse.\r\n\r\nSPECIES.\r\n\r\n1. _Jactitatio._ Restlessness. There is one kind of restlessness attending\r\nfevers, which consists in a frequent change of posture to relieve the\r\nuneasiness of the pressure of one part of the body upon another, when the\r\nsensibility of the system, or of some parts of it, is increased by\r\ninflammation, as in the lumbago; which may sometimes be distinguished in\r\nits early stage by the incessant desire of the patient to turn himself in\r\nbed. But there is another restlessness, which approaches towards writhing\r\nor contortions of the body, which is a voluntary effort to relieve pain;\r\nand may be esteemed a slighter kind of convulsion, not totally\r\nunrestrainable by opposite or counteracting volitions.\r\n\r\nM. M. A blister. Opium. Warm bath.\r\n\r\n2. _Tremor febrilis._ Reciprocal convulsions of the subcutaneous muscles,\r\noriginating from the pain of the sense of heat, owing to defect of its\r\nusual stimulus, and consequent accumulation of sensorial power in it. The\r\nactual deficiency of heat may exist in one part of the body, and the pain\r\nof cold be felt most vividly in some other part associated with it by\r\nsensitive sympathy. So a chillness down the back is first attended to in\r\nague-fits, though the disease perhaps commences with the torpor and\r\nconsequent coldness of some internal viscus. But in whatever part of the\r\nsystem the defect of heat exists, or the sensation of it, the convulsions\r\nof the subcutaneous muscles exerted to relieve it are very general; and, if\r\nthe pain is still greater, a chattering of the teeth is added, the more\r\nsuddenly to exhaust the sensorial power, and because the teeth are very\r\nsensible to cold.\r\n\r\nThese convulsive motions are nevertheless restrainable by violent voluntary\r\ncounteraction; and as their intervals are owing to the pain of cold being\r\nfor a time relieved by their exertion, they may be compared to laughter,\r\nexcept that there is no interval of pleasure preceding each moment of pain\r\nin this as in the latter.\r\n\r\nM. M. See I. 2. 2. 1.\r\n\r\n3. _Clamor._ Screaming from pain. The talkative animals, as dogs, and\r\nswine, and children, scream most, when they are in pain, and even from\r\nfear; as they have used this kind of exertion from their birth most\r\nfrequently and most forcibly; and can therefore sooner exhaust the\r\naccumulation of sensorial power in the affected muscular or sensual organs\r\nby this mode of exertion; as described in Sect. XXXIV. 1. 3. This facility\r\nof relieving pain by screaming is the source of laughter, as explained\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\n4. _Risus._ The pleasurable sensations, which occasion laughter, are\r\nperpetually passing into the bounds of pain; for pleasure and pain are\r\noften produced by different degrees of the same stimulus; as warmth, light,\r\naromatic or volatile odours, become painful by their excess; and the\r\ntickling on the soles of the feet in children is a painful sensation at the\r\nvery time it produces laughter. When the pleasurable ideas, which excite us\r\nto laugh, pass into pain, we use some exertion, as a scream, to relieve the\r\npain, but soon stop it again, as we are unwilling to lose the pleasure; and\r\nthus we repeatedly begin to scream, and stop again alternately. So that in\r\nlaughing there are three stages, first of pleasure, then pain, then an\r\nexertion to relieve that pain. See Sect. XXXIV. 1. 3.\r\n\r\nEvery one has been in a situation, where some ludicrous circumstance has\r\nexcited him to laugh; and at the same time a sense of decorum has forbid\r\nthe exertion of these interrupted screams; and then the pain has become so\r\nviolent, as to occasion him to use some other great action, as biting his\r\ntongue, and pinching himself, in lieu of the reiterated screams which\r\nconstitute laughter.\r\n\r\n5. _Convulsio._ Convulsion. When the pains from defect or excess of motion\r\nare more distressing than those already described, and are not relievable\r\nby such partial exertions, as in screaming, or laughter, more general\r\nconvulsions occur; which vary perhaps according to the situation of the\r\npained part, or to some previous associations formed by the early habits of\r\nlife. When these convulsive motions bend the body forwards, they are termed\r\nemprosthotonoi; when they bend it backward, they are termed opisthotonoi.\r\nThey frequently succeed each other, but the opisthotonoi are generally more\r\nviolent; as the muscles, which erect the body, and keep it erect, are\r\nnaturally in more constant and more forcible action than their antagonists.\r\n\r\nThe causes of convulsion are very numerous, as from toothing in children,\r\nfrom worms or acidity in their bowels, from eruption of the distinct\r\nsmall-pox, and lastly, from breathing too long the air of an unventilated\r\nbed-room. Sir G. Baker, in the Transactions of the College, described this\r\ndisease, and detected its cause; where many children in an orphan-house\r\nwere crowded together in one chamber without a chimney, and were almost all\r\nof them affected with convulsion; in the hospital at Dublin, many died of\r\nconvulsions before the real cause was understood. See Dr. Beddoes's Guide\r\nto Self-preservation. In a large family, which I attended, where many\r\nfemale servants slept in one room, which they had contrived to render\r\ninaccessible to every blast of air; I saw four who were thus seized with\r\nconvulsions, and who were believed to have been affected by sympathy from\r\nthe first who fell ill. They were removed into more airy apartments, but\r\nwere some weeks before they all regained their perfect health.\r\n\r\nConvulsion is distinguished from epilepsy, as the patient does not intirely\r\nlose all perception during the paroxysm. Which only shews, that a less\r\nexhaustion of sensorial power renders tolerable the pains which cause\r\nconvulsion, than those which cause epilepsy. The hysteric convulsions are\r\ndistinguished from those, owing to other causes, by the presence of the\r\nexpectation of death, which precedes and succeeds them, and generally by a\r\nflow of pale urine; these convulsions do not constantly attend the hysteric\r\ndisease, but are occasionally superinduced by the disagreeable sensation\r\narising from the torpor or inversion of a part of the alimentary canal.\r\nWhence the convulsion of laughter is frequently sufficient to restrain\r\nthese hysteric pains, which accounts for the fits of laughter frequently\r\nattendant on this disease.\r\n\r\nM. M. To remove the peculiar pain which excites the convulsions.\r\nVenesection. An emetic. A cathartic with calomel. Warm-bath. Opium in large\r\nquantities, beginning with smaller ones.

V. 3. p. 147. a paper by Dr. Currie.\r\n\r\n_Convulsio debilis._ The convulsions of dying animals, as of those which\r\nare bleeding to death in the slaughter-house, are an effort to relieve\r\npainful sensation, either of the wound which occasions their death, or of\r\nfaintness from want of due distention of the blood-vessels. Similar to this\r\nin a less degree is the subsultus tendinum, or starting of the tendons, in\r\nfevers with debility; these actions of the muscles are too weak to move the\r\nlimb, but the belly of the acting muscles is seen to swell, and the tendon\r\nto be stretched. These weak convulsions, as they are occasioned by the\r\ndisagreeable sensation of faintness from inanition, are symptoms of great\r\ngeneral debility, and thence frequently precede the general convulsions of\r\nthe act of dying. See a case of convulsion of a muscle of the arm, and of\r\nthe fore-arm, without moving the bones to which they were attached, Sect.\r\nXVII. 1. 8. See twitchings of the face, Class IV. 1. 3. 2.\r\n\r\n6. _Convulsio dolorifica._ Raphania. Painful convulsion. In this disease\r\nthe muscles of the arms and legs are exerted to relieve the pains left\r\nafter the rheumatism in young and delicate people; it recurs once or twice\r\na-day, and has been mistaken for the chorea, or St. Vitus's dance; but\r\ndiffers from it, as the undue motions in that disease only occur, when the\r\npatient endeavours to exert the natural ones; are not attended with pain;\r\nand cease, when he lies down without trying to move: the chorea, or dance\r\nof St. Vitus, is often introduced by the itch, this by the rheumatism.\r\n\r\nIt has also been improperly called nervous rheumatism; but is distinguished\r\nfrom rheumatism, as the pains recur by periods once or twice a day; whereas\r\nin the chronic rheumatism they only occur on moving the affected muscles.\r\nAnd by the warmth of a bed the pains of the chronic rheumatism are\r\nincreased, as the muscles or membranes then become more sensible to the\r\nstimulus of the extraneous mucaginous material deposited under them.\r\nWhereas the pains of the raphania, or painful convulsion, commence with\r\ncoldness of the part, or of the extremities. See Rheumatismus chronicus,\r\nClass I. 1. 3. 12.\r\n\r\nThe pains which accompany the contractions of the muscles in this disease,\r\nseem to arise from the too great violence of those contractions, as happens\r\nin the cramp of the calf of the leg; from which they differ in those being\r\nfixed, and these being reiterated contractions. Thus these convulsions are\r\ngenerally of the lower limbs, and recur at periodical times from some\r\nuneasy sensation from defect of action, like other periodic diseases; and\r\nthe convulsions of the limbs relieve the original uneasy painful sensation,\r\nand then produce a greater pain from their own too vehement contractions.\r\nThere is however another way of accounting for these pains, when they\r\nsucceed the acute rheumatism; and that is by the coagulable lymph, which\r\nmay be left still unabsorbed on the membranes; and which may be in too\r\nsmall quantity to affect them with pain in common muscular exertions, but\r\nmay produce great pain, when the bellies of the muscles swell to a larger\r\nbulk in violent action.\r\n\r\nM. M. Venesection. Calomel. Opium. Bark. One grain of calomel and one of\r\nopium for ten successive nights. A bandage spread with emplastrum de minio\r\nput tight on the affected part.\r\n\r\n7. _Epilepsia_ is originally induced, like other convulsions, by a\r\nvoluntary exertion to relieve some pain. This pain is most frequently about\r\nthe pit of the stomach, or termination of the bile-duct; and in some cases\r\nthe torpor of the stomach, which probably occasioned the epileptic fits,\r\nremains afterwards, and produces a chronical anorexia; of which a case is\r\nrelated in Class II. 2. 2. 1. There are instances of its beginning in the\r\nheel, of which a case is published by Dr. Short, in the Med. Essays, Edinb.\r\nI once saw a child about ten years old, who frequently fell down in\r\nconvulsions, as she was running about in play; on examination a wart was\r\nfound on one ancle, which was ragged and inflamed; which was directed to be\r\ncut off, and the fits never recurred.\r\n\r\nWhen epilepsy first commences, the patients are liable to utter one scream\r\nbefore they fall down; afterwards the convulsions so immediately follow the\r\npain, which occasions them, that the patient does not recollect or seem\r\nsensible of the preceding pain. Thus in laughter, when it is not excessive,\r\na person is not conscious of the pain, which so often recurs, and causes\r\nthe successive screams or exertions of laughter, which give a temporary\r\nrelief to it.\r\n\r\nEpileptic fits frequently recur in sleep from the increase of sensibility\r\nat that time, explained in Sect. XVIII. 14. In two such cases, both of\r\nyoung women, one grain of opium given at night, and continued many months,\r\nhad success; in one of them the opium was omitted twice at different times,\r\nand the fit recurred on both the nights. In the more violent case,\r\ndescribed in Sect. XVIII. 15, opium had no effect.\r\n\r\nEpileptic fits generally commence with setting the teeth, by which means\r\nthe tongue is frequently wounded; and with rolling the eyeballs in every\r\nkind of direction; for the muscles which suspend the jaw, as well as those\r\nwhich move the eyes, are in perpetual motion during our waking hours; and\r\nyet continue subservient to volition; hence their more facile and forcible\r\nactions for the purpose of relieving pain by the exhaustion of sensorial\r\npower. See Section XXXIV. 1. 4.\r\n\r\nEpileptic convulsions are not attended with the fear of death, as in the\r\nhysteric disease, and the urine is of a straw colour. However it must be\r\nnoted, that the disagreeable sensations in hysteric diseases sometimes are\r\nthe cause of true epileptic convulsions, of syncope, and of madness.\r\n\r\nThe pain, which occasions some fits of epilepsy, is felt for a time in a\r\ndistant part of the system, as in a toe or heel; and is said by the patient\r\ngradually to ascend to the head, before the general convulsions commence.\r\nThis ascending sensation has been called aura epileptica, and is said to\r\nhave been prevented from affecting the head by a tight bandage round the\r\nlimb. In this malady the pain, probably of some torpid membrane, or\r\ndiseased tendon, is at first only so great as to induce slight spasms of\r\nthe muscular fibres in its vicinity; which slight spasms cease on the\r\nnumbness introduced by a tight bandage; when no bandage is applied, the\r\npain gradually increases, till generally convulsions are exerted to relieve\r\nit. The course of a lymphatic, as when poisonous matter is absorbed; or of\r\na nerve, as in the sciatica, may, by the sympathy existing between their\r\nextremities and origins, give an idea of the ascent of an aura or vapour.\r\n\r\nIn difficult parturition it sometimes happens, that general convulsions are\r\nexcited to relieve the pain of labour, instead of the exertions of those\r\nmuscles of the abdomen and diaphragm, which ought to forward the exclusion\r\nof the child. See Class III. 1. 1. That is, instead of the particular\r\nmuscular actions, which ought to be excited by sensation to remove the\r\noffending cause, general convulsions are produced by the power of volition,\r\nwhich still the pain, as in common epilepsy, without removing the cause;\r\nand, as the parturition is not thus promoted, the convulsions continue,\r\ntill the sensorial power is totally exhausted, that is, till death. In\r\npatients afflicted with epilepsy from other causes, I have seen the most\r\nviolent convulsions recur frequently during pregnancy without miscarriage,\r\nas they did not tend to forward the exclusion of the fetus.\r\n\r\nM. M. Venesection. A large dose of opium. Delivery.\r\n\r\nThe later in life epileptic fits are first experienced, the more dangerous\r\nthey may be esteemed in general; as in these cases the cause has generally\r\nbeen acquired by the habits of the patient, or by the decay of some part,\r\nand is thus probably in an increasing state. Whereas in children the\r\nchanges in the system, as they advance to puberty, sometimes removes the\r\ncause. So in toothing, fits of convulsion with stupor frequently occur, and\r\ncease when the tooth advances; but this is not to be expected in advanced\r\nlife. Sir ----, about sixty years of age, had only three teeth left in his\r\nupper jaw, a canine tooth, and one on each side of it. He was seized with\r\nepileptic fits, with pain commencing in these teeth. He was urged to have\r\nthem extracted, which he delayed too long, till the fits were become\r\nhabitual, and then had them extracted in vain, and in a few months sunk\r\nunder the disease.\r\n\r\nMr. F----, who had lived intemperately, and had been occasionally affected\r\nwith the gout, was suddenly seized with epileptic fits; the convulsions\r\nwere succeeded by apoplectic snoring; from which he was, in about 20\r\nminutes, disturbed by fresh convulsions, and had continued in this\r\nsituation above four-and-twenty hours. About eight ounces of blood were\r\nthen taken from him; and after having observed, that the apoplectic's\r\ntorpor continued about 20 minutes, I directed him to be forcibly raised up\r\nin bed, after he had thus lain about fifteen minutes, to gain an interval\r\nbetween the termination of the sleep, and the renovation of convulsion. In\r\nthis interval he was induced to swallow forty drops of laudanum. Twenty\r\nmore were given him in the same manner in about half an hour, both which\r\nevidently shortened the convulsion fits, and the consequent stupor; he then\r\ntook thirty more drops, which for the present removed the fits. He became\r\nrather insane the next day, and after about three more days lost the\r\ninsanity, and recovered his usual state of health.\r\n\r\nThe case mentioned in Sect. XXVII. 2. where the patient was left after\r\nepileptic fits with a suffusion of blood beneath the tunica adjunctiva of\r\nthe eye, was in almost every respect similar to the preceding, and\r\nsubmitted to the same treatment. Both of them suffered frequent relapses,\r\nwhich were relieved by the same means, and at length perished, I believe,\r\nby the epileptic fits.\r\n\r\nIn those patients, who have not been subject to epilepsy before they have\r\narrived to about forty years of age, and who have been intemperate in\r\nrespect to spirituous potation, I have been induced to believe, that the\r\nfits were occasioned by the pain of a diseased liver; and this became more\r\nprobable in one of the above subjects, who had used means to repel\r\neruptions on the face; and thus by some stimulant application had prevented\r\nan inflammation taking place on the skin of the face instead of on some\r\npart of the liver. Secondly, as in these cases insanity had repeatedly\r\noccurred, which could not be traced from an hereditary source; there is\r\nreason to believe, that this as well as the epileptic convulsions were\r\ncaused by spirituous potation; and that this therefore is the original\r\nsource both of epilepsy and of insanity in those families, which are\r\nafflicted with them. This idea however brings some consolation with it; as\r\nit may be inferred, that in a few sober generations these diseases may be\r\neradicated, which otherwise destroy the family.\r\n\r\nM. M.

In the common epilepsy the\r\nconvulsions are immediately induced, as soon as the disagreeable sensation,\r\nwhich causes them, commences; but in this the pain continues long with cold\r\nextremities, gradually increasing for two or three hours, till at length\r\nconvulsions or madness come on; which terminate the daily paroxysm, and\r\ncease themselves in a little time afterwards.\r\n\r\nThis disease sometimes originates from a pain about the lower edge of the\r\nliver, sometimes in the temple, and sometimes in the pudendum; it recurs\r\ndaily for five or six weeks, and then ceases for several months. The pain\r\nis owing to defect of action, that is, to the accumulation of sensorial\r\npower in the part, which probably sympathizes with some other part, as\r\nexplained in Sect. XXXV. 2. XII. 5. 3. and Class II. 1. 1. 11. and IV. 2.\r\n2. 3.\r\n\r\nIt is the most painful malady that human nature is liable to!--See Sect.\r\nXXXIV. 1. 4.\r\n\r\nMrs. C---- was seized every day about the same hour with violent pain on\r\nthe right side of her bowels about the situation of the lower edge of the\r\nliver, without fever, which increased for an hour or two, till it became\r\ntotally intolerable. After violent screaming she fell into convulsions,\r\nwhich terminated sometimes in fainting, with or without stertor, as in\r\ncommon epilepsy; at other times a tempory insanity supervened; which\r\ncontinued about half an hour, and the fit ceased. These paroxysms had\r\nreturned daily for two or three weeks, and were at length removed by large\r\ndoses of opium, like the fits of reverie or somnambulation. About half an\r\nhour before the expected return of the fit three or four grains of opium\r\nwere exhibited, and then tincture of opium was given in warm brandy and\r\nwater about 20 or 30 drops every half hour, till the eyes became somewhat\r\ninflamed, and the nose began to itch, and by the sharp movements of the\r\npatient, or quick speech, an evident intoxication appeared; and then it\r\ngenerally happened that the pain ceased. But the effects of this large dose\r\nof opium was succeeded by perpetual sickness and efforts to vomit, with\r\ngreat general debility all the succeeding day.\r\n\r\nThe rationale of this temporary cure from the exhibition of opium and\r\nvinous spirit depends on the great expenditure of sensorial power in the\r\nincreased actions of all the irritative motions, by the stimulus of such\r\nlarge quantities of opium and vinous spirit; together with the production\r\nof much sensation, and many movements of the organs of sense or ideas in\r\nconsequence of that sensation; and lastly, even the motions of the arterial\r\nsystem become accelerated by this degree of intoxication, all which soon\r\nexhausted so much sensorial power as to relieve the pain; which would\r\notherwise have caused convulsions or insanity, which are other means of\r\nexpending sensorial power. The general debility on the succeeding day, and\r\nthe particular debility of the stomach, attended in consequence with\r\nsickness and frequent efforts to vomit, were occasioned by the system\r\nhaving previously been so strongly stimulated, and those parts in\r\nparticular on which the opium and wine more immediately acted. This\r\nsickness continued so many hours as to break the catenation of motions,\r\nwhich had daily reproduced the paroxysm; and thus it generally happened,\r\nthat the whole disease ceased for some weeks or months from one great\r\nintoxication, a circumstance not easily to be explained on any other\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\nThe excess or defect of motion in any part of the system occasions the\r\nproduction of pain in that part, as in Sect. XII. 1. 6. This defect or\r\nexcess of fibrous action is generally induced by excess or defect of the\r\nstimulus of objects external to the moving organ. But there is another\r\nsource of excessive fibrous action, and consequent pain, which is from\r\nexcess of volition, which is liable to affect those muscles, that have weak\r\nantagonists; as those which support the under jaw, and close the mouth in\r\nbiting, and those of the calf of the leg; which are thus liable to fixed or\r\npainful contractions, as in trismus, or locked jaw, and in the cramp of the\r\ncalf of the leg; and perhaps in some colics, as in that of Japan: these\r\npains, from contraction arising from excess of volition in the part from\r\nthe want of the counteraction of antagonist muscles, may give occasional\r\ncause to epileptic fits, and may be relieved in the same way, either by\r\nexciting irritative and sensitive motions by the stimulus of opium and\r\nwine; or by convulsions or insanity, as described above, which are only\r\ndifferent methods of exhausting the general quantity of sensorial power.\r\n\r\nConsidering the great resemblance between this kind of painful epilepsy and\r\nthe colic of Japan, as described by Kemfer; and that that disease was said\r\nto be cured by acupuncture, or the prick of a needle; I directed some very\r\nthin steel needles to be made about three inches long, and of such a\r\ntemper, that they would bend double rather than break; and wrapped wax\r\nthread over about half an inch of the blunt end for a handle. One of these\r\nneedles, when the pain occurred, was pushed about an inch into the painful\r\npart, and the pain instantly ceased; but I was not certain, whether the\r\nfear of the patient, or the stimulus of the puncture, occasioned the\r\ncessation of pain; and as the paroxysm had continued some weeks, and was\r\nthen declining, the experiment was not tried again. The disease is said to\r\nbe very frequent in Japan, and its seat to be in the bowels, and that the\r\nacupuncture eliminates the air, which is supposed to distend the bowel. But\r\nthough the aperture thus made is too small to admit of the eduction of air;\r\nyet as the stimulus of so small a puncture may either excite a torpid part\r\ninto action, or cause a spasmodic one to cease to act; and lastly, as no\r\ninjury could be likely to ensue from so small a perforation, I should be\r\ninclined at some future time to give this a fairer trial in similar\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nAnother thing worth trial at the commencement of this deplorable disease\r\nwould be electricity, by passing strong shocks through the painful part;\r\nwhich, whether the pain was owing to the inaction of that part, or of some\r\nother membrane associated with it, might stimulate them into exertion; or\r\ninto inactivity, if owing to fixed painful contraction.\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, the cold bath, or aspersions with cold water on the affected\r\npart, according to the method of Dr. Currie in the Memoirs of a Med. Soc.\r\nLondon, V. iii. p. 147, might produce great effect at the commencement of\r\nthe pain. Nevertheless opium duly administered, so as to precede the\r\nexpected paroxysm, and in such doses, given by degrees, as to induce\r\nintoxication, is principally to be depended upon in this deplorable malady.\r\nTo which should be added, that if venesection can be previously performed,\r\neven to but few ounces, the effect of the opium is much more certain; and\r\nstill more so, if there be time to premise a brisk cathartic, or even an\r\nemetic. The effect of increased stimulus is so much greater after previous\r\ndefect of stimulus; and this is still of greater advantage where the cause\r\nof the disease happens to consist in a material, which can be absorbed. See\r\nArt. IV. 2. 8.\r\n\r\nM. M. Venesection. An emetic. A cathartic. Warm bath. Opium a grain every\r\nhalf hour. Wine. Spirit of wine. If the patient becomes intoxicated by the\r\nabove means, the fit ceases, and violent vomitings and debility succeed on\r\nthe subsequent day, and prevent a return. Blisters or sinapisms on the\r\nsmall of the leg, taken off when they give much pain, are of use in\r\nslighter convulsions. Acupuncture. Electricity. Aspersion with cold water\r\non the painful part.\r\n\r\n9. _Somnambulismus._ Sleep-walking is a part of reverie, or studium inane,\r\ndescribed in Sect. XIX. In this malady the patients have only the general\r\nappearance of being asleep in respect to their inattention to the stimulus\r\nof external objects, but, like the epilepsies above described, it consists\r\nin voluntary exertions to relieve pain. The muscles are subservient to the\r\nwill, as appears by the patient's walking about, and sometimes doing the\r\ncommon offices of life. The ideas of the mind also are obedient to the\r\nwill, because their discourse is consistent, though they answer imaginary\r\nquestions. The irritative ideas of external objects continue in this\r\nmalady, because the patients do not run against the furniture of the room;\r\nand when they apply their volition to their organs of sense, they become\r\nsensible of the objects they attend to, but not otherwise, as general\r\nsensation is destroyed by the violence of their voluntary exertions. At the\r\nsame time the sensations of pleasure in consequence of ideas excited by\r\nvolition are vividly experienced, and other ideas seem to be excited by\r\nthese pleasurable sensations, as appears in the case of Master A. Sect.\r\nXXXIV. 3. 1. where a history of a hunting scene was voluntarily recalled,\r\nwith all the pleasurable ideas which attended it. In melancholy madness the\r\npatient is employed in voluntarily exciting one idea, with those which are\r\nconnected with it by voluntary associations only, but not so violently as\r\nto exclude the stimuli of external objects. In reverie variety of ideas are\r\noccasionally excited by volition, and those which are connected with them\r\neither by sensitive or voluntary associations, and that so violently as to\r\nexclude the stimuli of external objects. These two situations of our\r\nsensual motions, or ideas, resemble convulsion and epilepsy; as in the\r\nformer the stimulus of external objects is still perceived, but not in the\r\nlatter. Whence this disease, so far from being connected with sleep, though\r\nit has by universal mistake acquired its name from it, arises from excess\r\nof volition, and not from a suspension of it; and though, like other kinds\r\nof epilepsy, it often attacks the patients in their sleep, yet those two,\r\nwhom I saw, were more frequently seized with it while awake, the\r\nsleep-walking being a part of the reverie. See Sect. XIX. and XXXIV. 3. and\r\nClass II. 1. 7. 4. and III. 1. 2. 18.\r\n\r\nM. M. Opium in large doses before the expected paroxysm.\r\n\r\n10. _Asthma convulsivum._ The fits of convulsive asthma return at periods,\r\nand are attended with cold extremities, and so far resemble the access of\r\nan intermittent fever; but, as the lungs are not sensible to the pain of\r\ncold, a shivering does not succeed, but instead of it violent efforts of\r\nrespiration; which have no tendency, as in the humoral asthma, to dislodge\r\nany offending material, but only to relieve the pain by exertion, like the\r\nshuddering in the beginning of ague-fits, as explained Class III. 1. 1. 2.\r\n\r\nThe insensibility of the lungs to cold is observable on going into frosty\r\nair from a warm room; the hands and face become painfully cold, but no such\r\nsensation is excited in the lungs; which is another argument in favour of\r\nthe existence of a peculiar set of nerves for the purpose of perceiving the\r\nuniversal fluid matter of heat, in which all things are immersed. See Sect.\r\nXIV. 6. Yet are the lungs nevertheless very sensible to the deficiency of\r\noxygen in the atmosphere, as all people experience, when they go into a\r\nroom crowded with company and candles, and complain, that it is so close,\r\nthey can scarcely breathe; and the same in some hot days in summer.\r\n\r\nThere are two diseases, which bear the name of asthma. The first is the\r\ntorpor or inability of the minute vessels of the lungs, consisting of the\r\nterminations of the pulmonary and bronchial arteries and veins, and their\r\nattendant lymphatics; in this circumstance it resembles the difficulty of\r\nbreathing, which attends cold bathing. If this continues long, a congestion\r\nof fluid in the air-cells succeeds, as the absorbent actions cease\r\ncompletely before the secerning ones; as explained in Class I. 1. 2. 3. And\r\nthe coldness, which attends the inaction of these vessels, prevents the\r\nusual quantity of exhalation. Some fits cease before this congestion takes\r\nplace, and in them no violent sweating nor any expuition of phlegm occurs.\r\nThis is the humoral asthma, described at Class II. 1. 1. 7.\r\n\r\nThe second kind of asthma consists in the convulsive actions in consequence\r\nof the disagreeable sensations thus induced; which in some fits of asthma\r\nare very great, as appears in the violent efforts to raise the ribs, and to\r\ndepress the diaphragm, by lifting the shoulders. These, so long as they\r\ncontribute to remove the cause of the disease, are not properly\r\nconvulsions, but exertions immediately caused by sensation; but in this\r\nkind of asthma they are only efforts to relieve pain, and are frequently\r\npreceded by other epileptic convulsions.\r\n\r\nThese two kinds of asthmas have so many resembling features, and are so\r\nfrequently intermixed, that it often requires great attention to\r\ndistinguish them; but as one of them is allied to anasarca, and the other\r\nto epilepsy, we shall acquire a clearer idea of them by comparing them with\r\nthose disorders. A criterion of the humoral or hydropic asthma is, that it\r\nis relieved by copious sweats about the head and breast, which are to be\r\nascribed to the sensitive exertions of the pulmonary vessels to relieve the\r\npain occasioned by the anasarcous congestion in the air-cells; and which is\r\neffected by the increased absorption of the mucus, and its elimination by\r\nthe retrograde action of those lymphatics of the skin, whose branches\r\ncommunicate with the pulmonary ones; and which partial sweats do not easily\r\nadmit of any other explanation. See Class I. 3. 2. 8. Another criterion of\r\nit is, that it is generally attended with swelled legs, or other symptoms\r\nof anasarca. A criterion of the convulsive asthma may be had from the\r\nabsence of these cold clammy sweats of the upper part of the body only, and\r\nfrom the patient having occasionally been subject to convulsions of the\r\nlimbs, as in the common epilepsy.\r\n\r\nIt may thus frequently happen, that in the humoral asthma some exertions of\r\nthe lungs may occur, which may not contribute to discharge the anasarcous\r\nlymph, but may be efforts simply to relieve pain; besides those efforts,\r\nwhich produce the increased absorption and elimination of it; and thus we\r\nhave a bodily disease resembling in this circumstance the reverie, in which\r\nboth sensitive and voluntary motions are at the same time, or in\r\nsuccession, excited for the purpose of relieving pain.\r\n\r\nIt may likewise sometimes happen, that the disagreeable sensation,\r\noccasioned by the congestion of lymph in the air-cells in the humoral or\r\nhydropic asthma, may induce voluntary convulsions of the respiratory organs\r\nonly to relieve the pain, without any sensitive actions of the pulmonary\r\nabsorbents to absorb and eliminate the congestion of serous fluid; and thus\r\nthe same cause may occasionally induce either the humoral or convulsive\r\nasthma.\r\n\r\nThe humoral asthma has but one remote cause, which is the torpor of the\r\npulmonary vessels, like that which occurs on going into the cold bath; or\r\nthe want of absorption of the pulmonary lymphatics to take up the lymph\r\neffused into the air-cell. Whereas the convulsive asthma, like other\r\nconvulsions, or epilepsies, may be occasioned by pain in almost any remote\r\npart of the system. But in some of the adult patients in this disease, as\r\nin many epilepsies, I have suspected the remote cause to be a pain of the\r\nliver, or of the biliary ducts.\r\n\r\nThe asthmas, which have been induced in consequence of the recess of\r\neruptions, especially of the leprous kind, countenance this opinion. One\r\nlady I knew, who for many years laboured under an asthma, which ceased on\r\nher being afflicted with pain, swelling, and distortion of some of her\r\nlarge joints, which were esteemed gouty, but perhaps erroneously. And a\r\nyoung man, whom I saw yesterday, was seized with asthma on the\r\nretrocession, or ceasing of eruptions on his face.\r\n\r\nThe convulsive asthma, as well as the hydropic, are more liable to return\r\nin hot weather; which may be occasioned by the less quantity of oxygen\r\nexisting in a given quantity of warm air, than of cold, which can be taken\r\ninto the lungs at one inspiration. They are both most liable to occur after\r\nthe first sleep, which is therefore a general criterion of asthma. The\r\ncause of this is explained in Sect. XVIII. 15. and applies to both of them,\r\nas our sensibility to internal uneasy sensation increases during sleep.\r\n\r\nWhen children are gaining teeth, long before they appear, the pain of the\r\ngums often induces convulsions. This pain is relieved in some by sobbing\r\nand screaming; but in others a laborious respiration is exerted to relieve\r\nthe pain; and this constitutes the true asthma convulsivum. In other\r\nchildren again general convulsions, or epileptic paroxysms, are induced for\r\nthis purpose; which, like other epilepsies, become established by habit,\r\nand recur before the irritation has time to produce the painful sensation,\r\nwhich originally caused them.\r\n\r\nThe asthma convulsivum is also sometimes induced by worms, or by acidity in\r\nthe stomachs of children, and by other painful sensations in adults; in\r\nwhom it is generally called nervous asthma, and is often joined with other\r\nepileptic symptoms.\r\n\r\nThis asthma is distinguished from the peripneumony, and from the croup, by\r\nthe presence of fever in the two latter. It is distinguished from the\r\nhumoral asthma, as in that the patients are more liable to run to the cold\r\nair for relief, are more subject to cold extremities, and experience the\r\nreturns of it more frequently after their first sleep. It is distinguished\r\nfrom the hydrops thoracis, as that has no intervals, and the patient sits\r\nconstantly upright, and the breath is colder; and, where the pericardium is\r\naffected, the pulse is quick and unequal. See Hydrops Thoracis, I. 2. 3.\r\n14.\r\n\r\nM. M. Venesection once. A cathartic with calomel once. Opium. Assafoetida.\r\nWarm bath. If the cause can be detected, as in toothing or worms, it should\r\nbe removed. As this species of asthma is so liable to recur during sleep,\r\nlike epileptic fits, as mentioned in Section XVIII. 15. there was reason to\r\nbelieve, that the respiration of an atmosphere mixed with hydrogen, or any\r\nother innocuous air, which might dilute the oxygen, would be useful in\r\npreventing the paroxysms by decreasing the sensibility of the system. This,\r\nI am informed by Dr. Beddoes, has been used with decided success by Dr.\r\nFerriar. See Class II. 1. 1. 7.\r\n\r\n11. _Asthma dolorificum._ Angina pectoris. The painful asthma was first\r\ndescribed by Dr. Heberden in the Transactions of the College; its principal\r\nsymptoms consist in a pain about the middle of the sternum, or rather\r\nlower, on every increase of pulmonary or muscular exertion, as in walking\r\nfaster than usual, or going quick up a hill, or even up stairs; with great\r\ndifficulty of breathing, so as to occasion the patient instantly to stop. A\r\npain in the arms about the insertion of the tendon of the pectoral muscle\r\ngenerally attends, and a desire of resting by hanging on a door or branch\r\nof a tree by the arms is sometimes observed. Which is explained in Class I.\r\n2. 3. 14. and in Sect. XXIX. 5. 2.\r\n\r\nThese patients generally die suddenly; and on examining the thorax no\r\ncertain cause, or seat, of the disease has been detected; some have\r\nsupposed the valves of the arteries, or of the heart, were imperfect; and\r\nothers that the accumulation of fat about this viscus or the lungs\r\nobstructed their due action; but other observations do not accord with\r\nthese suppositions.\r\n\r\nMr. W----, an elderly gentleman, was seized with asthma during the hot part\r\nof last summer; he always waked from his first sleep with difficult\r\nrespiration, and pain in the middle of his sternum, and after about an hour\r\nwas enabled to sleep again. As this had returned for about a fortnight, it\r\nappeared to me to be an asthma complicated with the disease, which Dr.\r\nHeberden has called angina pectoris. It was treated by venesection, a\r\ncathartic, and then by a grain of opium given at going to bed, with ether\r\nand tincture of opium when the pain or asthma required, and lastly with the\r\nbark, but was several days before it was perfectly subdued.\r\n\r\nThis led me to conceive, that in this painful asthma the diaphragm, as well\r\nas the other muscles of respiration, was thrown into convulsive action, and\r\nthat the fibres of this muscle not having proper antagonists, a painful\r\nfixed spasm of it, like that of the muscles in the calf of the leg in the\r\ncramp, might be the cause of death in the angina pectoris, which I have\r\nthence arranged under the name of painful asthma, and leave for further\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nFrom the history of the case of the late much lamented John Hunter, and\r\nfrom the appearances after death, the case seems to have been of this kind,\r\ncomplicated with vertigo and consequent affection of the stomach. The\r\nremote cause seems to have arisen from ossifications of the coronary\r\narteries; and the immediate cause of his death from fixed spasm of the\r\nheart. Other histories and dissections are still required to put this\r\nmatter out of doubt; as it is possible, that either a fixed spasm of the\r\ndiaphragm, or of the heart, which are both furnished with but weak\r\nantagonists, may occasion sudden death; and these may constitute two\r\ndistinct diseases.\r\n\r\nFour patients I have now in my recollection, all of whom I believed to\r\nlabour under the angina pectoris in a great degree; which have all\r\nrecovered, and have continued well three or four years by the use, as I\r\nbelieve, of issues on the inside of each thigh; which were at first large\r\nenough to contain two pease each, and afterwards but one. They took besides\r\nsome slight antimonial medicine for a while, and were reduced to half the\r\nquantity or strength of their usual potation of fermented liquor.\r\n\r\nThe use of femoral issues in angina pectoris was first recommended by Dr.\r\nMacbride, physician at Dublin, Med. Observ. & Enquir. Vol. VI. And I was\r\nfurther induced to make trial of them, not only because the means which I\r\nhad before used were inadequate, but from the ill effect I once observed\r\nupon the lungs, which succeeded the cure of a small sore beneath the knee;\r\nand argued conversely, that issues in the lower limbs might assist a\r\ndifficult respiration.\r\n\r\nMrs. L----, about fifty, had a small sore place about the size of half a\r\npea on the inside of the leg a little below the knee. It had discharged a\r\npellucid fluid, which she called a ley-water, daily for fourteen years,\r\nwith a great deal of pain; on which account she applied to a surgeon, who,\r\nby means of bandage and a saturnine application, soon healed the sore,\r\nunheedful of the consequences. In less than two months after this I saw her\r\nwith great difficulty of breathing, which with universal anasarca soon\r\ndestroyed her.\r\n\r\nThe theory of the double effect of issues, as above related, one in\r\nrelieving by their presence the asthma dolorificum, and the other in\r\nproducing by its cure an anasarca of the lungs, is not easy to explain.\r\nSome similar effects from cutaneous eruptions and from blisters are\r\nmentioned in Class I. 1. 2. 9. In these cases it seems probable, that the\r\npain occasioned by issues, and perhaps the absorption of a small quantity\r\nof aerated purulent matter, stimulate the whole system into greater energy\r\nof action, and thus prevent the torpor which is the beginning of so many\r\ndiseases. In confirmation of this effect of pain on the system, I remember\r\nthe case of a lady of an ingenious and active mind, who, for many of the\r\nlatter years of her life, was perpetually subject to great pains of her\r\nhead from decaying teeth. When all her teeth were gone, she became quite\r\nlow spirited, and melancholy in the popular sense of that word, and after a\r\nyear or two became universally dropsical and died.\r\n\r\nM. M. Issues in the thighs. Five grains of rhubarb, and one sixth of a\r\ngrain of emetic tartar every night for some months, with or without half a\r\ngrain of opium. No stronger liquor than small beer, or wine diluted with\r\ntwice its quantity of water. Since I wrote the above I have seen two cases\r\nof hydrops thoracis, attended with pain in the left arm, so as to be\r\nmistaken for asthma dolorificum, in which femoral issues, though applied\r\nearly in the disease, had no effect.\r\n\r\n12. _Stridor dentium._ The clattering of the teeth on going into cold\r\nwater, or in the beginning of ague-fits, is an exertion along with the\r\ntremblings of the skin to relieve the pain of cold. The teeth and skin\r\nbeing more sensible to cold than the more internal parts, and more exposed\r\nto it, is the reason that the muscles, which serve them, are thrown into\r\nexertion from the pain of cold rather than those of respiration, as in\r\nscreaming from more acute pain. Thus the poet,\r\n\r\n  Put but your toes into cold water,\r\n  Your correspondent teeth will clatter.\r\n                          PRIOR.\r\n\r\nIn more acute pains the jaws are gnashed together with great vehemence,\r\ninsomuch that sometimes the teeth are said to have been broken by the\r\nforce. See Sect. XXXIV. 1. 3. In these cases something should be offered to\r\nthe patient to bite, as a towel, otherwise they are liable to tear their\r\nown arms, or to bite their attendants, as I have witnessed in the painful\r\nepilepsy.\r\n\r\n13. _Tetanus trismus._ Cramp. The tetanus consists of a fixed spasm of\r\nalmost all the muscles of the body; but the trismus, or locked jaw, is the\r\nmost frequent disease of this kind. It is generally believed to arise from\r\nsympathy with an injured tendon. In one case where it occurred in\r\nconsequence of a broken ankle from a fall from a horse, it was preceded by\r\nevident hydrophobia. Amputation was advised, but not submitted to; two\r\nwounds were laid into one with scissors, but the patient died about the\r\nseventh day from the accident. In this case the wounded tendon, like the\r\nwounds from the bite of a mad dog, did not produce the hydrophobia, and\r\nthen the locked jaw, till several days after the accident.\r\n\r\nI twice witnessed the locked jaw from a pain beneath the sternum, about the\r\npart where it is complained of in painful asthma, or angina pectoris, in\r\nthe same lady at some years distance of time. The last time it had\r\ncontinued two days, and she wrote her mind, or expressed herself by signs.\r\nOn observing a broken tooth, which made a small aperture into her mouth, I\r\nrolled up five grains of opium like a worm about an inch long, and\r\nintroducing it over the broken tooth, pushed it onward by means of a small\r\ncrow-quill; as it dissolved I observed she swallowed her saliva, and in\r\nless than half an hour, she opened her mouth and conversed as usual.\r\n\r\nMen are taught to be ashamed of screaming from pain in their early years;\r\nhence they are prone to exert the muscles of the jaws instead, which they\r\nhave learnt to exert frequently and violently from their infancy; whence\r\nthe locked jaw. This and the following spasm have no alternate relaxations,\r\nlike the preceding ones; which is perhaps owing, first, to the weakness of\r\ntheir antagonist muscles, those which elevate the jaw being very strong for\r\nthe purpose of biting and masticating hard substances, and for supporting\r\nthe under jaw, with very weak antagonist muscles; and secondly, to their\r\nnot giving sufficient relief even for a moment to the pain, or its\r\npreceding irritation, which excited them.\r\n\r\nM. M. Opium in very large quantities. Mercurial ointment used extensively.\r\nElectricity. Cold bath. Dilate the wound, and fill it with lint moistened\r\nwith spirit of turpentine; which inflames the wound, and cures or prevents\r\nthe convulsions. See a case, Transact. of American Society, Vol. II. p.\r\n227.\r\n\r\nWine in large quantities in one case was more successful than opium; it\r\nprobably inflames more, which in this disease is desirable. Between two or\r\nthree ounces of bark, and from a quart to three pints of wine a day,\r\nsucceeded better than opium. Ib.\r\n\r\n14. _Tetanus dolorificus._ Painful cramp. This kind of spasm most\r\nfrequently attacks the calf of the leg, or muscles of the toes; it often\r\nprecedes paroxysms of gout, and appears towards the end of violent\r\ndiarrhoea, and from indigestion, or from acid diet. In these cases it seems\r\nto sympathize with the bowels, but is also frequently produced by the pain\r\nof external cold, and to the too great previous extension of the muscles,\r\nwhence some people get the cramp in the extensor muscles of the toes after\r\nwalking down hill, and of those of the calf of the leg after walking up a\r\nsteep eminence. For the reason why these cramps commence in sleep, see\r\nSect. XVIII. 15.\r\n\r\nThe muscle in this disease contracts itself to relieve some smaller pain,\r\neither from irritation or association, and then falls into great pain\r\nitself, from the too great action of its own fibres. Hence any muscle, by\r\nbeing too vehemently exerted, falls into cramp, as in swimming too forcibly\r\nin water, which is painfully cold; and a secondary pain is then induced by\r\nthe too violent contraction of the muscle; though the pain, which was the\r\ncause of the contraction, ceases. Which accounts for the continuance of the\r\ncontraction, and distinguishes this disease from other convulsions, which\r\nare relaxed and exerted alternately. Hence whatever may be the cause of the\r\nprimary pain, which occasions the cramp of the calf of the leg, the\r\nsecondary one is relievable by standing up, and thus by the weight of the\r\nbody on the toes forcibly extending the contracted muscles. For the cause,\r\nwhich induces these muscles of the calf of the leg to fall into more\r\nviolent contraction than other spasmodic muscles, proceeds from the\r\nweakness of their antagonist muscles; as they are generally extended again\r\nafter action by the weight of the body on the balls of the toes. See the\r\npreceding article.\r\n\r\nM. M. Rub the legs with camphor dissolved in oil, and let the patient wear\r\nstockings in bed. If a foot-board be put at the bed's feet, and the bed be\r\nso inclined, that he will rest a little with his toes against the\r\nfoot-board, that pressure is said to prevent the undue contractions of the\r\nmusculi gastrocnemii, which constitute the calf of the leg. In gouty\r\npatients, or where the bowels are affected with acidity, half a grain of\r\nopium, and six grains of rhubarb, and six of chalk, every night. Flesh-meat\r\nto supper. A little very weak warm spirit and water may be taken for\r\npresent relief, when these cramps are very troublesome to weak or gouty\r\npatients.\r\n\r\n15. _Hydrophobia._ Dread of water generally attending canine madness. I was\r\nwitness to a case, where this disease preceded the locked jaw from a wound\r\nin the ankle, occasioned by a fall from a horse; as mentioned in the\r\npreceding article. It came on about the sixth day after the accident; when\r\nthe patient attempted to swallow fluids, he became convulsed all over from\r\nthe pain of this attempt, and spurted them out of his mouth with violence.\r\nIt is also said to happen in some hysterical cases. Hence it seems rather\r\nthe immediate consequence of a pained tendon, than of a contagious poison.\r\nAnd is so far analogous to tetanus, according with the opinions of Doctor\r\nRusch and Doctor Percival.\r\n\r\nIn other respects, as it is produced by the saliva of an enraged animal\r\ninstilled into a wound, it would seem analogous to the poison of venomous\r\nanimals. And from the manner of its access so long after the bite, and of\r\nits termination in a short time, it would seem to resemble the progress of\r\ncontagious fevers. See Sect. XXII. 3. 3.\r\n\r\nIf the patient was bitten in a part, which could be totally cut away, as a\r\nfinger, even after the hydrophobia appears, it is probable it might cure\r\nit; as I suspect the cause still remains in the wounded tendon, and not in\r\na diffused infection tainting the blood. Hence there are generally uneasy\r\nsensations, as cold or numbness, in the old cicatrix, before the\r\nhydrophobia commences. See a case in Medical Communications, Vol. II. p.\r\n190.\r\n\r\nIf the diseased tendon could be inflamed without cutting it out, as by\r\ncupping, or caustic, or blister after cupping, and this in the old wound\r\nlong since healed, after the hydrophobia commences, might prevent the\r\nspasms about the throat. As inflaming the teeth by the use of mercury is of\r\nuse in some kinds of hemicrania. Put spirit of turpentine on the wound,\r\nwash it well. See Class I. 3. 1. 11. IV. 1. 2. 7.\r\n\r\nM. M. Wine, musk, oil, internally. Opium, mercurial ointment, used\r\nextensively. Mercurial fumigation. Turpeth mineral. To salivate the patient\r\nas soon as possible. Exsection or a caustic on the scar, even after the\r\nappearance of hydrophobia. Put a tight bandage on the limb above the scar\r\nof the old wound to benumb the pained tendon, however long the wound may\r\nhave been healed. Could a hollow catheter of elastic gum, caoutchouc, be\r\nintroduced into the oesophagus by the mouth or nostril, and liquid\r\nnourishment be thus conveyed into the stomach? See Desault's Journal, Case\r\nI. where, in an ulcer of the mouth, such a catheter was introduced by the\r\nnostril, and kept in the oesophagus for a month, by which means the patient\r\nwas nourished and preserved.\r\n\r\nIt is recommended by Dr. Bardsley to give oil internally by a similar\r\nmethod contrived by Mr. John Hunter. He covered a probang with the skin of\r\na small eel, or the gut of a lamb or cat. It was tied up at one end above\r\nand below the sponge, and a slit made above the upper ligature; to the\r\nother end of the eel-skin or gut was fixed a bladder and pipe. The probang\r\nthus covered was introduced into the stomach, and the liquid food or\r\nmedicine was put into the bladder and squeezed down through the eel-skin.\r\nMem. of Society at Manchester. See Class I. 2. 3. 25.\r\n\r\nDr. Bardsley has endeavoured to prove, that dogs never experience the\r\nhydrophobia, or canine madness, without having been previously bitten or\r\ninfected; and secondly, that the disease in this species of animal always\r\nshews itself in five or six weeks; and concludes from hence, that this\r\ndreadful malady might be annihilated by making all the dogs in Great\r\nBritain perform a kind of quarantine, by shutting them up for a certain\r\nnumber of weeks. Though the disease from the bite of the mad dog is perhaps\r\nmore analogous to those from the wounds inflicted by venomous animals than\r\nto those from other contagious matter, yet these observations are well\r\nworthy further attention; which the author promises.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nORDO I.\r\n\r\n_Increased Volition._\r\n\r\nGENUS II.\r\n\r\n_With increased Actions of the Organs of Sense._\r\n\r\nIn every species of madness there is a peculiar idea either of desire or\r\naversion, which is perpetually excited in the mind with all its\r\nconnections. In some constitutions this is connected with pleasurable ideas\r\nwithout the exertion of much muscular action, in others it produces violent\r\nmuscular action to gain or avoid the object of it, in others it is attended\r\nwith despair and inaction. Mania is the general word for the two former of\r\nthese, and melancholia for the latter; but the species of them are as\r\nnumerous as the desires and aversions of mankind.\r\n\r\nIn the present age the pleasurable insanities are most frequently induced\r\nby superstitious hopes of heaven, by sentimental love, and by personal\r\nvanity. The furious insanities by pride, anger, revenge, suspicion. And the\r\nmelancholy ones by fear of poverty, fear of death, and fear of hell; with\r\ninnumerable others.\r\n\r\n  Quicquid agunt homines, votum, timor, ira, voluptas,\r\n  Gaudia, discursus, nostri est farrago libelli.\r\n                                JUVEN. I. 85.\r\n\r\nThis idea, however, which induces madness or melancholy, is generally\r\nuntrue; that is, the object is a mistaken fact. As when a patient is\r\npersuaded he has the itch, or venereal disease, of which he has no symptom,\r\nand becomes mad from the pain this idea occasions. So that the object of\r\nmadness is generally a delirious idea, and thence cannot be conquered by\r\nreason; because it continues to be excited by painful sensation, which is a\r\nstronger stimulus than volition. Most frequently pain of body is the cause\r\nof convulsion, which is often however exchanged for madness; and a painful\r\ndelirious idea is most frequently the cause of madness originally, but\r\nsometimes of convulsion. Thus I have seen a young lady become convulsed\r\nfrom a fright, and die in a few days; and a temporary madness frequently\r\nterminates the paroxysms of the epilepsia dolorifica, and an insanity of\r\ngreater permanence is frequently induced by the pains or bruises of\r\nparturition.\r\n\r\nWhere the patient is debilitated a quick pulse sometimes attends insane\r\npeople, which is nevertheless generally only a symptom of the debility,\r\nowing to the too great expenditure of sensorial power; or of the paucity of\r\nits production, as in inirritative, or in sensitive inirritated fever. See\r\nIII. 1. 1.\r\n\r\nBut nevertheless where the quick pulse is permanent, it shews the presence\r\nof fever; and as the madness then generally arises from the disagreeable\r\nsensations attending the fever, it is so far a good symptom; because when\r\nthe fever is cured, or ceases spontaneously, the insanity most frequently\r\nvanishes at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe stimulus of so much volition supports insane people under variety of\r\nhardships, and contributes to the cure of diseases from debility, as\r\nsometimes occurs towards the end of fevers. See Sect. XXXIV. 2. 5. And, on\r\nthe same account, they bear large doses of medicines to procure any\r\noperation on them; as emetics, and cathartics, which, before they produce\r\ntheir effect in inverting the motions of the stomach in vomiting, or of the\r\nabsorbents of the bowels in purging, must first weaken the natural actions\r\nof those organs, as shewn in Sect. XXXV. 1. 3.\r\n\r\nFrom these considerations it appears, that the indications of cure must\r\nconsist in removing the cause of the pain, whether it arises from a\r\ndelirious idea, or from a real fact, or from bodily disease; or secondly,\r\nif this cannot be done, by relieving the pain in consequence of such idea\r\nor disease. The first is sometimes effected by presenting frequently in a\r\nday contrary ideas to shew the fallacy, or the too great estimation, of the\r\npainful ideas. 2dly. By change of place, and thus presenting the stimulus\r\nof new objects, as a long journey. 3dly. By producing forgetfulness of the\r\nidea or object, which causes their pain; by removing all things which recal\r\nit to their minds; and avoiding all conversation on similar subjects. For I\r\nsuppose no disease of the mind is so perfectly cured by other means as by\r\nforgetfulness.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the pain in consequence of the ideas or bodily diseases above\r\ndescribed is to be removed, first, by evacuations, as venesection, emetics,\r\nand cathartics; and then by large doses of opium, or by the vertigo\r\noccasioned by a circulating swing, or by a sea-voyage, which, as they\r\naffect the organs of sense as well as evacuate the stomach, may contribute\r\nto answer both indications of cure.\r\n\r\nWhere maniacs are outrageous, there can be no doubt but coercion is\r\nnecessary; which may be done by means of a straight waistcoat; which\r\ndisarms them without hurting them; and by tying a handkerchief round their\r\nankles to prevent their escape. In others there can be no doubt, but that\r\nconfinement retards rather than promotes their cure; which is forwarded by\r\nchange of ideas in consequence of change of place and of objects, as by\r\ntravelling or sailing.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances which render confinement necessary, are first, if the\r\nlunatic is liable to injure others, which must be judged of by the outrage\r\nhe has already committed. 2dly. If he is likely to injure himself; this\r\nalso must be judged of by the despondency of his mind, if such exists.\r\n3dly. If he cannot take care of his affairs. Where none of these\r\ncircumstances exist, there should be no confinement. For though the\r\nmistaken idea continues to exist, yet if no actions are produced in\r\nconsequence of it, the patient cannot be called insane, he can only be\r\ntermed delirious. If every one, who possesses mistaken ideas, or who puts\r\nfalse estimates on things, was liable to confinement, I know not who of my\r\nreaders might not tremble at the sight of a madhouse!\r\n\r\nThe most convenient distribution of insanities will be into general, as\r\nmania mutabilis, studium inane, and vigilia; and into partial insanities.\r\nThese last again may be subdivided into desires and aversions, many of\r\nwhich are succeeded by pleasurable or painful ideas, by fury or dejection,\r\naccording to the degree or violence of their exertions. Hence the analogy\r\nbetween the insanities of the mind, and the convulsions of the muscles\r\ndescribed in the preceding genus, is curiously exact. The convulsions\r\nwithout stupor, are either just sufficient to obliterate the pain, which\r\noccasions them; or are succeeded by greater pain, as in the convulsio\r\ndolorifica. So the exertions in the mania mutabilis are either just\r\nsufficient to allay the pain which occasions them, and the patient dwells\r\ncomparatively in a quiet state; or those exertions excite painful ideas,\r\nwhich are succeeded by furious discourses, or outrageous actions. The\r\nstudium inane, or reverie, resembles epilepsy, in which there is no\r\nsensibility to the stimuli of external objects. Vigilia, or watchfulness,\r\nmay be compared to the general writhing of the body; which is just a\r\nsufficient exertion to relieve the pain which occasions it. Erotomania may\r\nbe compared to trismus, or other muscular fixed spasm, without much\r\nsubsequent pain; and mæror to cramp of the muscles of the leg, or other\r\nfixed spasm with subsequent pain. All these coincidences contribute to\r\nshew, as explained in Sect. III. 5, that our ideas are motions of the\r\nimmediate organs of sense obeying the same laws as our muscular motions.\r\n\r\nThe violence of action accompanying insanity depends much on the education\r\nof the person; those who have been proudly educated with unrestrained\r\npassions, are liable to greater fury; and those, whose education has been\r\nhumble, to greater despondency. Where the delirious idea, above described,\r\nproduces pleasurable sensations, as in personal vanity or religious\r\nenthusiasm; it is almost a pity to snatch them from their fool's paradise,\r\nand reduce them again to the common lot of humanity; lest they should\r\ncomplain of their cure, like the patient described in Horace,\r\n\r\n  --------Pol! me occidistis, amici,\r\n  Non servastis, ait, cui sic extorta voluptas,\r\n  Et demptus per vim mentis gratissimus error!\r\n\r\nThe disposition to insanity, as well as to convulsion, is believed to be\r\nhereditary; and in consequence to be induced in those families from\r\nslighter causes than in others. Convulsions have been shewn to have been\r\nmost frequently induced by pains owing to defect of stimulus, as the\r\nshuddering from cold, and not from pains from excess of stimulus, which are\r\ngenerally succeeded by inflammation. But insanities are on the contrary\r\ngenerally induced by pains from excess of stimulus, as from the too violent\r\nactions of our ideas, as in common anger, which is an insanity of short\r\nduration; for insanities generally, though not always, arise from pains of\r\nthe organs of sense; but convulsions generally, though not always, from\r\npains of the membranes or glands. And it has been previously explained,\r\nthat though the membrane and glands, as the stomach and skin, receive great\r\npain from want of stimulus; yet that the organs of sense, as the eye and\r\near, receive no pain from defect of stimulus.\r\n\r\nHence it follows, that the constitutions most liable to convulsion, are\r\nthose which most readily become torpid in some part of the system, that is,\r\nwhich possess less irritability; and that those most liable to insanity,\r\nare such as have excess of sensibility; and lastly, that these two\r\ncircumstances generally exist in the same constitution; as explained in\r\nSect. XXXI. 2. on Temperaments. These observations explain why epilepsy and\r\ninsanity frequently succeed or reciprocate with each other, and why\r\ninirritable habits, as scrophulous ones, are liable to insanity, of which I\r\nhave known some instances.\r\n\r\nIn many cases however there is no appearance of the disposition to epilepsy\r\nor insanity of the parent being transmitted to the progeny. First, where\r\nthe insanity has arisen from some violent disappointment, and not from\r\nintemperance in the use of spirituous liquors. Secondly, where the parent\r\nhas acquired the insanity or epilepsy by habits of intoxication after the\r\nprocreation of his children. Which habits I suppose to be the general cause\r\nof the disposition to insanity in this country. See Class III. 1. 1. 7.\r\n\r\nAs the disposition to gout, dropsy, epilepsy, and insanity, appears to be\r\nproduced by the intemperate use of spirituous potation, and is in all of\r\nthem hereditary; it seems probable, that this disposition gradually\r\nincreases from generation to generation, in those families which continue\r\nfor many generations to be intemperate in this respect; till at length\r\nthese diseases are produced; that is, the irritability of the system\r\ngradually is decreased by this powerful stimulus, and the sensibility at\r\nthe same time increased, as explained in Sect. XXXI. 1. and 2. This\r\ndisposition is communicated to the progeny, and becomes still increased, if\r\nthe same stimulus be continued, and so on by a third and fourth generation;\r\nwhich accounts for the appearance of epilepsy in the children of some\r\nfamilies, where it was never known before to have existed, and could not be\r\nascribed to their own intemperance. A parity of reasoning shews, that a few\r\nsober generations may gradually in the same manner restore a due degree of\r\nirritability to the family, and decrease the excess of sensibility.\r\n\r\nFrom hence it would appear probable, that scrophula and dropsy are diseases\r\nfrom inirritability; but that in epilepsy and insanity an excess of\r\nsensibility is added, and the two faulty temperaments are thus conjoined.\r\n\r\nSPECIES.\r\n\r\n1. _Mania mutabilis._ Mutable madness. Where the patients are liable to\r\nmistake ideas of sensation for those from irritation, that is, imaginations\r\nfor realities, if cured of one source of insanity, they are liable in a few\r\nmonths to find another source in some new mistaken or imaginary idea, and\r\nto act from this new idea. The idea belongs to delirium, when it is an\r\nimaginary or mistaken one; but it is the voluntary actions exerted in\r\nconsequence of this mistaken idea, which constitute insanity.\r\n\r\nIn this disease the patient is liable carefully to conceal the object of\r\nhis desire or aversion. But a constant inordinate suspicion of all people,\r\nand a carelessness of cleanliness, and of decency, are generally\r\nconcomitants of madness. Their designs cannot be counteracted, till you can\r\ninvestigate the delirious idea or object of their insanity; but as they are\r\ngenerally timid, they are therefore less to be dreaded.\r\n\r\nZ. Z. called a young girl, one of his maid-servants, into the parlour, and,\r\nwith cocked pistols in his hands, ordered her to strip herself naked; he\r\nthen inspected her with some attention, and dismissed her untouched. Then\r\nhe stripped two of his male servants in the same manner, to the great\r\nterror of the neighbourhood. After he was secured, with much difficulty he\r\nwas persuaded to tell me, that he had got the itch, and had examined some\r\nof his servants to find out from whom he had received it; though at the\r\nsame time there was not a spot to be seen on his hands, or other parts. The\r\noutrages in consequence of this false idea were in some measure to be\r\nascribed to the pride occasioned by unrestrained education, affluent\r\nwealth, and dignified family.\r\n\r\nMadness is sometimes produced by bodily pain, particularly I believe of a\r\ndiseased liver, like convulsion and epilepsy; at other times it is caused\r\nby very painful ideas occasioned by external circumstances, as of grief or\r\ndisappointment; but the most frequent cause of insanity arises from the\r\npain of some imaginary or mistaken idea; which may be termed hallucinatio\r\nmaniacalis. This hallucination of one of the senses is often produced in an\r\ninstant, and generally becomes gradually weakened in process of time, by\r\nthe perpetual stimulus of external objects, or by the successions of other\r\ncatenations of ideas, or by the operations of medicines; and when the\r\nmaniacal hallucination ceases, or is forgotten, the violent exertions\r\ncease, which were in consequence of it, and the disease is cured.\r\n\r\nMr. ----, a clergyman, about forty years of age, who was rather a weak man,\r\nhappened to be drinking wine in jocular company, and by accident swallowed\r\na part of the seal of a letter, which he had just then received; one of his\r\ncompanions seeing him alarmed, cried out in humour, \"It will seal your\r\nbowels up.\" He became melancholy from that instant, and in a day or two\r\nrefused to swallow any kind of nourishment. On being pressed to give a\r\nreason for this refusal, he answered, he knew nothing would pass through\r\nhim. A cathartic was given, which produced a great many evacuations, but he\r\nstill persisted, that nothing passed through him; and though he was\r\nfrightened into taking a little broth once or twice by threats, yet he soon\r\nceased intirely to swallow any thing, and died in consequence of this\r\ninsane idea.\r\n\r\nMiss ----, a sensible and ingenious lady, about thirty, said she had seen\r\nan angel; who told her, that she need not eat, though all others were under\r\nthe necessity of supporting their earthly existence by food. After\r\nfruitless persuasions to take food, she starved herself to death.--It was\r\nproposed to send an angel of an higher order to tell her, that now she must\r\nbegin to eat and drink again; but it was not put into execution.\r\n\r\nMrs. ----, a lady between forty and fifty years of age, imagined that she\r\nheard a voice say to her one day, as she was at her toilet, \"Repent, or you\r\nwill be damned.\" From that moment she became melancholy, and this\r\nhallucination affected her in greater or less degree for about two years;\r\nshe then recovered perfectly, and is now a cheerful old woman.\r\n\r\nMrs. ----, a farmer's wife, going up stairs to dress, found the curtains of\r\nher bed drawn, and on undrawing them, she believed that she saw the corpse\r\nof her sister, who was then ill at the distance of twenty miles, and became\r\nfrom that time insane; and as her sister died about the time, she could not\r\nbe produced to counteract the insane hallucination, but she perfectly\r\nrecovered in a few months.\r\n\r\nMrs. ----, a most elegant, beautiful, and accomplished lady, about\r\ntwenty-two years of age, had been married about two months to an elegant,\r\npolished, and affluent young man, and it was well known to be a love-match\r\non both sides. She suddenly became melancholy, and yet not to so great a\r\ndegree, but that she could command herself to do the honours of her table\r\nwith grace and apparent ease. After many days intreaty, she at length told\r\nme, that she thought her marrying her husband had made him unhappy; and\r\nthat this idea she could not efface from her mind day or night. I withstood\r\nher being confined, as some had advised, and proposed a sea-voyage to her,\r\nwith expectation that the sickness, as well as change of objects, might\r\nremove the insane hallucination, by introducing other energetic ideas; this\r\nwas not complied with, but she travelled about England with her friends and\r\nher husband for many months, and at length perfectly recovered, and is now\r\nI am informed in health and spirits.\r\n\r\nThese cases are related to shew the utility of endeavouring to investigate\r\nthe maniacal idea, or hallucination; as it may not only acquaint us with\r\nthe probable designs of the patient, from whence may be deduced the\r\nnecessity of confinement; but also may some time lead to the most effectual\r\nplan of cure.\r\n\r\nI received good information of the truth of the following case, which was\r\npublished a few years ago in the newspapers. A young farmer in\r\nWarwickshire, finding his hedges broke, and the sticks carried away during\r\na frosty season, determined to watch for the thief. He lay many cold hours\r\nunder a hay-stack, and at length an old woman, like a witch in a play,\r\napproached, and began to pull up the hedge; he waited till she had tied up\r\nher bottle of sticks, and was carrying them off, that he might convict her\r\nof the theft, and then springing from his concealment, he seized his prey\r\nwith violent threats. After some altercation, in which her load was left\r\nupon the ground, she kneeled upon her bottle of sticks, and raising her\r\narms to heaven beneath the bright moon then at the full, spoke to the\r\nfarmer already shivering with cold, \"Heaven grant, that thou never mayest\r\nknow again the blessing to be warm.\" He complained of cold all the next\r\nday, and wore an upper coat, and in a few days another, and in a fortnight\r\ntook to his bed, always saying nothing made him warm, he covered himself\r\nwith very many blankets, and had a sieve over his face, as he lay; and from\r\nthis one insane idea he kept his bed above twenty years for fear of the\r\ncold air, till at length he died.\r\n\r\nM. M. As mania arises from pain either of our muscles or organs of sense,\r\nthe arts of relieving pain must constitute the method of cure. See Sect.\r\nXXXIV. 3. 4. Venesection. Vomits of from five grains to ten of emetic\r\ntartar, repeated every third morning for three or four times; with solution\r\nof gum-ammoniac, and soluble tartar, so as to purge gently every day.\r\nAfterwards warm bath for two or three hours a day. Opium in large doses.\r\nBark. Steel.\r\n\r\nDr. Binns gave two scruples (40 grains) of solid opium at a dose, and\r\ntwenty grains four hours afterwards; which restored the patient. Dr.\r\nBrandreth gave 400 drops of laudanum to a maniac in the greatest possible\r\nfuror, and in a few hours he became calm and rational. Med. Comment for\r\n1791, p. 384.\r\n\r\n_Prognostic._\r\n\r\nThe temporary quick pulse attending some maniacal cases is simply a symptom\r\nof debility, and is the consequence of too great exertions; but a permanent\r\nquick pulse shews the presence of fever, and is frequently a salutary sign;\r\nbecause, if the life of the patient be safe, when the fever ceases, the\r\ninsanity generally vanishes along with it, as mentioned above. In this case\r\nthe kind of fever must direct the method of curing the insanity; which must\r\nconsist of moderate evacuations and diluents, if the pulse be strong; or by\r\nnutrientia, bark, and small doses of opium, if the pulse be weak.\r\n\r\nWhere the cause is of a temporary nature, as in puerperal insanity, there\r\nis reason to hope, that the disease will cease, when the bruises, or other\r\npainful sensations attending this state, are removed. In these cases the\r\nchild should be brought frequently to the mother, and applied to her\r\nbreast, if she will suffer it, and this whether she at first attends to it\r\nor not; as by a few trials it frequently excites the storgè, or maternal\r\naffection, and removes the insanity, as I have witnessed.\r\n\r\nWhen the madness is occasioned by pain of the teeth, which I believe is no\r\nuncommon case, these must be extracted; and the cure follows the extinction\r\nof the pain. There is however some difficulty in detecting the delinquent\r\ntooth in this case, as in hemicrania, unless by its apparent decay, or by\r\nsome previous information of its pain having been complained of; because\r\nthe pain of the tooth ceases, as soon as the exertions of insanity\r\ncommence.\r\n\r\nWhen a person becomes insane, who has a family of small children to solicit\r\nhis attention, the prognostic is very unfavourable; as it shews the\r\nmaniacal hallucination to be more powerful than those ideas which generally\r\ninterest us the most.\r\n\r\n2. _Studium inane._ Reverie consists of violent voluntary exertions of\r\nideas to relieve pain, with all the trains or tribes connected with them by\r\nsensations or associations. It frequently alternates with epileptic\r\nconvulsions; with which it corresponds, in respect to the insensibility of\r\nthe mind to the stimuli of external objects, in the same manner as madness\r\ncorresponds with common convulsion, in the patient's possessing at the same\r\ntime a sensibility of the stimuli of external objects.\r\n\r\nSome have been reported to have been involved in reverie so perfectly, as\r\nnot to have been disturbed by the discharge of a cannon; and others to have\r\nbeen insensible to torture, as the martyrs for religious opinions; but\r\nthese seem more properly to belong to particular insanities than to\r\nreverie, like nostalgia and erotomania.\r\n\r\nReverie is distinguished from madness as described above; and from\r\ndelirium, because the trains of ideas are kept consistent by the power of\r\nvolition, as the person reasons and deliberates in it. Somnambulismus is a\r\npart of reverie, the latter consisting in the exertions of the locomotive\r\nmuscles, and the former of the exertions of the organs of sense; see Class\r\nIII. 1. 1. 9. and Sect. XIX. both which are mixed, or alternate with each\r\nother, for the purpose of relieving pain.\r\n\r\nWhen the patients in reverie exert their volition on their organs of sense,\r\nthey can occasionally perceive the stimuli of external objects, as\r\nexplained in Sect. XIX. And in this case it resembles sometimes an\r\nhallucination of the senses, as there is a mixture of fact and imagination\r\nin their discourse; but may be thus distinguished: hallucinations of the\r\nlenses are allied to delirium, and are attended generally with quick pulse,\r\nand other symptoms of great debility; but reverie is without fever, and\r\ngenerally alternates with convulsions; and so much intuitive analogy (see\r\nSect. XVII. 3. 7.) is retained in its paroxysms, as to preserve a\r\nconsistency in the trains of ideas.\r\n\r\nMiss G----, whose case is related in Sect. III. 5. 8. said, as I once sat\r\nby her, \"My head is fallen off, see it is rolled to that corner of the\r\nroom, and the little black dog is nibbling the nose off.\" On my walking to\r\nthe place which she looked at, and returning, and assuring her that her\r\nnose was unhurt, she became pacified, though I was doubtful whether she\r\nattended to me. See Class III. 1. 1. 9. and Class III. 1. 2. 2.\r\n\r\nM. M. Large doses of opium given before the expected paroxysm, as in\r\nepilepsia dolorifica, Class III. 1. 1. 8.\r\n\r\nThe hallucinatio studiosa, or false ideas in reverie, differ from maniacal\r\nhallucinations above described, as no insane exertions succeed, and in the\r\npatients whom I have seen they have always been totally forgotten, when the\r\nparoxysm was over.\r\n\r\nMaster ----, a school-boy about twelve years old, after he came out of a\r\nconvulsion fit and sat up in bed, said to me, \"Don't you see my father\r\nstanding at the feet of the bed, he is come a long way on foot to see me.\"\r\nI answered, no: \"What colour is his coat!\" He replied, \"A drab colour.\"\r\n\"And what buttons?\" \"Metal ones,\" he answered, and added, \"how sadly his\r\nlegs are swelled.\" In a few minutes he said, with apparent surprise, \"He is\r\ngone,\" and returned to his perfect mind. Other cases are related in Sect.\r\nXIX. and XXXIV. 3. and in Class III. 1. 2. 2. with further observations on\r\nthis kind of hallucination; which however is not the cause of reverie, but\r\nconstitutes a part of it, the cause being generally some uneasy sensation\r\nof the body.\r\n\r\n3. _Vigilia._ Watchfulness consists in the unceasing exertion of volition;\r\nwhich is generally caused by some degree of pain either of mind or of body,\r\nor from defect of the usual quantity of pleasurable sensation; hence if\r\nthose, who are accustomed to wine at night, take tea instead, they cannot\r\nsleep. The same happens from want of solid food for supper, to those who\r\nare accustomed to use it; as in these cases there is pain or defect of\r\npleasure in the stomach.\r\n\r\nSometimes the anxiety about sleeping, that is the desire to sleep, prevents\r\nsleep; which consists in an abolition of desire or will. This may so far be\r\ncompared to the impediment of speech described in Sect. XVII. 1. 10. as the\r\ninterference of the will prevents the effect desired.\r\n\r\nAnother source of watchfulness may be from the too great secretion of\r\nsensorial power in the brain, as in phrenzy, and as sometimes happens from\r\nthe exhibition of opium, and of wine; if the exhaustion of sensorial power\r\nby the general actions of the system occasioned by the stimulus of these\r\ndrugs can be supposed to be less than the increased secretion of it.\r\n\r\nM. M. 1. Solid food to supper. Wine. Opium. Warm bath. 2. The patient\r\nshould be told that his want of sleep is of no consequence to his health.\r\n3. Venesection by cupping. Abstinence from wine. 4. A blister by\r\nstimulating the skin, and rhubarb by stimulating the bowels, will sometimes\r\ninduce sleep. Exercise. An uniform sound, as of a pausing drop of water, or\r\nthe murmur of bees. Other means are described in Sect. XVIII. 20.\r\n\r\n4. _Erotomania._ Sentimental love. Described in its excess by\r\nromance-writers and poets. As the object of love is beauty, and as our\r\nperception of beauty consists in a recognition by the sense of vision of\r\nthose objects, which have before inspired our love, by the pleasure they\r\nhave afforded to many of our senses (Sect. XVI. 6); and as brute animals\r\nhave less accuracy of their sense of vision than mankind (ib.); we see the\r\nreason why this kind of love is not frequently observable in the brute\r\ncreation, except perhaps in some married birds, or in the affection of the\r\nmother to her offspring. Men, who have not had leisure to cultivate their\r\ntaste for visible objects, and who have not read the works of poets and\r\nromance-writers, are less liable to sentimental love; and as ladies are\r\neducated rather with an idea of being chosen, than of choosing; there are\r\nmany men, and more women, who have not much of this insanity; and are\r\ntherefore more easily induced to marry for convenience or interest, or from\r\nthe flattery of one sex to the other.\r\n\r\nIn its fortunate gratification sentimental love is supposed to supply the\r\npurest source of human felicity; and from the suddenness with which many of\r\nthose patients, described in Species I. of this genus, were seized with the\r\nmaniacal hallucination, there is reason to believe, that the most violent\r\nsentimental love may be acquired in a moment of time, as represented by\r\nShakespeare in the beginning of his Romeo and Juliet.\r\n\r\nSome have endeavoured to make a distinction between beauty and grace, and\r\nhave made them as it were rivals for the possession of the human heart; but\r\ngrace may be defined beauty in action; for a sleeping beauty cannot be\r\ncalled graceful in whatever attitude she may recline; the muscles must be\r\nin action to produce a graceful attitude, and the limbs to produce a\r\ngraceful motion. But though the object of love is beauty, yet the idea is\r\nnevertheless much enhanced by the imagination of the lover; which appears\r\nfrom this curious circumstance, that the lady of his passion seldom appears\r\nso beautiful to the lover after a few months separation, as his ideas had\r\npainted her in his absence; and there is, on that account, always a little\r\ndisappointment felt for a minute at their next interview from this\r\nhallucination of his ideas.\r\n\r\nThis passion of love produces reverie in its first state, which exertion\r\nalleviates the pain of it, and by the assistance of hope converts it into\r\npleasure. Then the lover seeks solitude, lest this agreeable reverie should\r\nbe interrupted by external stimuli, as described by Virgil.\r\n\r\n  Tantum inter densas, umbrosa cacumina, fagos\r\n  Assiduè veniebat, ibi hæc incondita solus\r\n  Montibus et sylvis studio jactabat inani.\r\n\r\nWhen the pain of love is so great, as not to be relieved by the exertions\r\nof reverie, as above described; as when it is misplaced on an object, of\r\nwhich the lover cannot possess himself; it may still be counteracted or\r\nconquered by the stoic philosophy, which strips all things of their\r\nornaments, and inculcates \"nil admirari.\" Of which lessons may be found in\r\nthe meditations of Marcus Antoninus. The maniacal idea is said in some\r\nlovers to have been weakened by the action of other very energetic ideas;\r\nsuch as have been occasioned by the death of his favourite child, or by the\r\nburning of his house, or by his being shipwrecked. In those cases the\r\nviolence of the new idea for a while expends so much sensorial power as to\r\nprevent the exertion of the maniacal one; and new catenations succeed. On\r\nthis theory the lover's leap, so celebrated by poets, might effect a cure,\r\nif the patient escaped with life.\r\n\r\nThe third stage of this disease I suppose is irremediable; when a lover has\r\npreviously been much encouraged, and at length meets with neglect or\r\ndisdain; the maniacal idea is so painful as not to be for a moment\r\nrelievable by the exertions of reverie, but is instantly followed by\r\nfurious or melancholy insanity; and suicide, or revenge, have frequently\r\nbeen the consequence. As was lately exemplified in Mr. Hackman, who shot\r\nMiss Ray in the lobby of the playhouse. So the poet describes the passion\r\nof Dido,\r\n\r\n  ----------Moriamur inultæ?--\r\n  At moriamur, ait,--sic, sic, juvat ire sub umbras!\r\n\r\nThe story of Medæa seems to have been contrived by Ovid, who was a good\r\njudge of the subject, to represent the savage madness occasioned by\r\nill-requited love. Thus the poet,\r\n\r\n  Earth has no rage like love to hatred turn'd,\r\n  Nor hell a fury like a woman scorn'd.\r\n                          DRYDEN.\r\n\r\n5. _Amor sui._ Vanity consists of an agreeable reverie, and is well\r\nridiculed in the story of Narcissus, who so long contemplated his own\r\nbeautiful image in the water, that he died from neglect of taking\r\nsustenance. I once saw a handsome young man, who had been so much flattered\r\nby his parents, that his vanity rose so near to insanity, that one might\r\ndiscern by his perpetual attention to himself, and the difficulty with\r\nwhich he arranged his conversation, that the idea of himself intruded\r\nitself at every comma or pause of his discourse. In this degree vanity must\r\nafford great pleasure to the possessor; and when it exists within moderate\r\nbounds, may contribute much to the happiness of social life.\r\n\r\nMy friend Mr. ---- once complained to me, that he was much troubled with\r\nbashfulness in company, and believed that it arose from his want of\r\npersonal vanity; on this account he determined on a journey to Paris, when\r\nParis was the center of politeness; he there learnt to dress, to dance, and\r\nto move his hands gracefully in conversation; and returned a most\r\nconsummate coxcomb. But after a very few years he relapsed into rusticity\r\nof dress and manners.\r\n\r\nM. M. The cure of vanity may be attempted by excess of flattery, which will\r\nat length appear ridiculous, or by its familiarity will cease to be\r\ndesired. I remember to have heard a story of a nobleman in the court of\r\nFrance, when France had a court, who was so disagreeably vain in\r\nconversation, that the king was pleased to direct his cure, which was thus\r\nperformed. Two gentlemen were directed always to attend him, one was to\r\nstand behind his chair, and the other at a respectful distance before him;\r\nwhenever his lordship began to speak, one of them always pronounced, \"Lord\r\nGallimaufre is going to say the best thing in the world.\" And, as soon as\r\nhis lordship had done speaking, the other attendant pronounced, \"Lord\r\nGallimaufre has spoken the best thing in the world.\" Till in a few weeks\r\nthis noble lord was so disgusted with praise that he ceased to be vain; and\r\nhis majesty dismissed his keepers.\r\n\r\n6. _Nostalgia._ Maladie de Pais. Calenture. An unconquerable desire of\r\nreturning to one's native country, frequent in long voyages, in which the\r\npatients become so insane as to throw themselves into the sea, mistaking it\r\nfor green fields or meadows. The Swiss are said to be particularly liable\r\nto this disease, and when taken into foreign service frequently to desert\r\nfrom this cause, and especially after hearing or singing a particular tune,\r\nwhich was used in their village dances, in their native country, on which\r\naccount the playing or singing this tune was forbid by the punishment of\r\ndeath. Zwingerus.\r\n\r\n  Dear is that shed, to which his soul conforms,\r\n  And dear that hill, which lifts him to the storms.\r\n                                GOLDSMITH.\r\n\r\n7. _Spes religiosa._ Superstitious hope. This maniacal hallucination in its\r\nmilder state produces, like sentimental love, an agreeable reverie; but\r\nwhen joined with works of supererogation, it has occasioned many\r\nenormities. In India devotees consign themselves by vows to most painful\r\nand unceasing tortures, such as holding up their hands, till they cannot\r\nretract them; hanging up by hooks put into the thick skin over their\r\nshoulders, sitting upon sharp points, and other self torments. While in our\r\npart of the globe fasting and mortification, as flagellation, has been\r\nbelieved to please a merciful deity! The serenity, with which many have\r\nsuffered cruel martyrdoms, is to be ascribed to this powerful reverie.\r\n\r\nMr. ----, a clergyman, formerly of this neighbourhood, began to bruise and\r\nwound himself for the sake of religious mortification, and passed much time\r\nin prayer, and continued whole nights alone in the church. As he had a wife\r\nand family of small children, I believed the case to be incurable; as\r\notherwise the affection and employment in his family connections would have\r\nopposed the beginning of this insanity. He was taken to a madhouse without\r\neffect, and after he returned home, continued to beat and bruise himself,\r\nand by this kind of mortification, and by sometimes long fasting, he at\r\nlength became emaciated and died. I once told him in conversation, that\r\n\"God was a merciful being, and could not delight in cruelty, but that I\r\nsupposed he worshipped the devil.\" He was struck with this idea, and\r\npromised me not to beat himself for three days, and I believe kept his word\r\nfor one day. If this idea had been frequently forced on his mind, it might\r\nprobably have been of service.\r\n\r\nWhen these works of supererogation have been of a public nature, what\r\ncruelties, murders, massacres, has not this insanity introduced into the\r\nworld!--A commander, who had been very active in leading and encouraging\r\nthe bloody deeds of St. Bartholomew's day at Paris, on confessing his sins\r\nto a worthy ecclesiastic on his death-bed, was asked, \"Have you nothing to\r\nsay about St. Bartholomew?\" \"On that day,\" he replied, \"God Almighty was\r\nobliged to me!\"--The fear of hell is another insanity, which will be spoken\r\nof below.\r\n\r\n8. _Superbia stemmatis._ Pride of family has frequently formed a maniacal\r\nhallucination, which in its mild state has consisted in agreeable reverie,\r\nbut when it has been so painful as to demand homage from others, it has\r\nfrequently induced insane exertions. This insanity seems to have existed in\r\nthe flourishing state of Rome, as now all over Germany, and is attacked by\r\nJuvenal with great severity, a small part of which I shall here give as a\r\nmethod of cure. Sat. 8.\r\n\r\n  Say, what avails the pedigree, that brings\r\n  Thy boasted line from heroes or from kings;\r\n  Though many a mighty lord, in parchment roll'd,\r\n  Name after name, thy coxcomb hands unfold;\r\n  Though wreathed patriots crowd thy marble halls,\r\n  Or steel-clad warriors frown along the walls;\r\n  While on broad canvas in the gilded frame\r\n  All virtues flourish, and all glories flame?--\r\n  Say,--if ere noon with idiot laugh you lie\r\n  Wallowing in wine, or cog the dubious die,\r\n  Or act unshamed, by each indignant bust,\r\n  The midnight orgies of promiscuous lust!--\r\n    Go, lead mankind to Virtue's holy shrine,\r\n  With morals mend them, and with arts refine,\r\n  Or lift, with golden characters unfurl'd,\r\n  The flag of peace, and still a warring world!--\r\n  --So shall with pious hands immortal Fame\r\n  Wreathe all her laurels round thy honour'd name,\r\n  High o'er thy tomb with chissel bold engrave,\r\n  \"THE TRULY NOBLE ARE THE GOOD AND BRAVE.\"\r\n\r\n9. _Ambitio._ Inordinate desire of fame. A carelessness about the opinions\r\nof others is said by Xenophon to be the source of impudence; certainly a\r\nproper regard for what others think of us frequently incites us to virtuous\r\nactions, and deters us from vicious ones; and increases our happiness by\r\nenlarging our sphere of sympathy, and by flattering our vanity.\r\n\r\n  Abstract what others feel, what others think,\r\n  All pleasures sicken, and all glories sink.\r\n                          POPE.\r\n\r\nWhen this reverie of ambition excites to conquer nations, or to enslave\r\nthem, it has been the source of innumerable wars, and the occasion of a\r\ngreat devastation of mankind. Cæsar is reported to have boasted, that he\r\nhad destroyed three millions of his enemies, and one million of his\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nThe works of Homer are supposed to have done great injury to mankind by\r\ninspiring the love of military glory. Alexander was said to sleep with them\r\nalways on his pillow. How like a mad butcher amid a flock of sheep appears\r\nthe hero of the Iliad, in the following fine lines of Mr. Pope, which\r\nconclude the twentieth book.\r\n\r\n    His fiery coursers, as the chariot rolls,\r\n  Tread down whole ranks, and crush out heroes' souls;\r\n  Dash'd from their hoofs, as o'er the dead they fly,\r\n  Black bloody drops the smoaking chariot dye;--\r\n  The spiky wheels through heaps of carnage tore,\r\n  And thick the groaning axles dropp'd with gore;\r\n  High o'er the scene of death ACHILLES stood,\r\n  All grim with dust, all horrible with blood;\r\n  Yet still insatiate, still with rage on flame,\r\n  Such is the lust of never-dying fame!\r\n\r\nThe cure must be taken from moral writers. Woolaston says, Cæsar conquered\r\nPompey; that is, a man whose name consisted of the letters C. æ. s. a. r.\r\nconquered a long time ago a man, whose name consisted of the letters P. o.\r\nm. p. e. y. and that this is all that remains of either of them. Juvenal\r\nalso attacks this mode of insanity, Sat. X. 166.\r\n\r\n  --I, demens, et sævas curre per alpes,\r\n  Ut pueris placeas, et declamatio fias!\r\n\r\nWhich is thus translated by Dr. Johnson,\r\n\r\n  And left a name, at which the world grew pale,\r\n  To point a moral, or adorn a tale!\r\n\r\n10. _Mæror._ Grief. A perpetual voluntary contemplation of all the\r\ncircumstances of some great loss, as of a favourite child. In general the\r\npainful ideas gradually decrease in energy, and at length the recollection\r\nbecomes more tender and less painful. The letter of Sulpicius to Cicero on\r\nthe loss of his daughter is ingenious. The example of David on the loss of\r\nhis child is heroic.\r\n\r\nA widow lady was left in narrow circumstances with a boy and a girl, two\r\nbeautiful and lively children, the one six and the other seven years of\r\nage; as her circumstances allowed her to keep but one maid-servant, these\r\ntwo children were the sole attention, employment, and consolation of her\r\nlife; she fed them, dressed them, slept with them, and taught them herself;\r\nthey were both snatched from her by the gangrenous sore throat in one week:\r\nso that she lost at once all that employed her, as well as all that was\r\ndear to her. For the first three or four days after their death, when any\r\nfriend visited her, she sat upright, with her eyes wide open, without\r\nshedding tears, and affected to speak of indifferent things. Afterwards she\r\nbegan to weep much, and for some weeks talked to her friends of nothing\r\nelse but her dear children. But did not for many years, even to her dying\r\nhour, get quite over a gloom, which was left upon her countenance.\r\n\r\nIn violent grief, when tears flow, it is esteemed a good symptom; because\r\nthen the actions caused by sensitive association take the place of those\r\ncaused by volition; that is, they prevent the voluntary exertions of ideas,\r\nor muscular actions, which constitute insanity.\r\n\r\nThe sobbing and sighing attendant upon grief are not convulsive movements,\r\nthey are occasioned by the sensorial power being so expended on the painful\r\nideas, and their connections, that the person neglects to breathe for a\r\ntime, and then a violent sigh or sob is necessary to carry on the blood,\r\nwhich oppresses the pulmonary vessels, which is then performed by deep or\r\nquick inspirations, and laborious expirations. Sometimes nevertheless the\r\nbreath is probably for a while voluntarily held, as an effort to relieve\r\npain. The paleness and ill health occasioned by long grief is spoken of in\r\nClass IV. 2. 1. 9.\r\n\r\nThe melioration of grief by time, and its being at length even attended\r\nwith pleasure, depends on our retaining a distinct idea of the lost object,\r\nand forgetting for a time the idea of the loss of it. This pleasure of\r\ngrief is beautifully described by Akenside. Pleasures of Imagination, Book\r\nII. l. 680.\r\n\r\n    ----------Ask the faithful youth,\r\n  Why the cold urn of her, whom long he loved,\r\n  So often fills his arms; so often draws\r\n  His lonely footsteps at the silent hour\r\n  To pay the mournful tribute of his tears?\r\n  Oh! he will tell thee, that the wealth of worlds\r\n  Should ne'er seduce his bosom to forego\r\n  That sacred hour; when, stealing from the noise\r\n  Of care and envy, sweet remembrance soothes\r\n  With Virtue's kindest looks his aching breast,\r\n  And turns his tears to rapture.\r\n\r\nM. M. Consolation is best supplied by the Christian doctrine of a happy\r\nimmortality. In the pagan religion the power of dying was the great\r\nconsolation in irremediable distress. Seneca says, \"no one need be unhappy\r\nunless by his own fault.\" And the author of Telemachus begins his work by\r\nsaying, that Calypso could not console herself for the loss of Ulysses, and\r\nfound herself unhappy in being immortal. In the first hours of grief the\r\nmethods of consolation used by uncle Toby, in Tristram Shandy, is probably\r\nthe best; \"he sat down in an arm chair by the bed of his distressed friend,\r\nand said nothing.\"\r\n\r\n11. _Tædium vitæ._ The inanity of sublunary things has afforded a theme to\r\nphilosophers, moralists, and divines, from the earliest records of\r\nantiquity; \"Vanity of vanities!\" says the preacher, \"all is vanity!\" Nor is\r\nthere any one, I suppose, who has passed the meridian of life, who has not\r\nat some moments felt the nihility of all things.\r\n\r\nWeariness of life in its moderate degree has been esteemed a motive to\r\naction by some philosophers. See Sect. XXXIV. 2. 3. But in those men, who\r\nhave run through the usual amusements of life early in respect to their\r\nage; and who have not industry or ability to cultivate those sciences,\r\nwhich afford a perpetual fund of novelty, and of consequent entertainment,\r\nare liable to become tired of life, as they suppose there is nothing new to\r\nbe found in it, that can afford them pleasure; like Alexander, who is said\r\nto have shed tears, because he had not another world to conquer.\r\n\r\nMr. ----, a gentleman about fifty, of polished manners, who in a few months\r\nafterwards destroyed himself, said to me one day, \"a ride out in the\r\nmorning, and a warm parlour and a pack of cards in the afternoon, is all\r\nthat life affords.\" He was persuaded to have an issue on the top of his\r\nhead, as he complained of a dull head-ach, which being unskilfully managed,\r\ndestroyed the pericranium to the size of an inch in diameter; during the\r\ntime this took in healing, he was indignant about it, and endured life, but\r\nsoon afterwards shot himself.\r\n\r\nMr. ----, a gentleman of Gray's Inn, some years ago was prevailed upon by\r\nhis friends to dismiss a mistress, by whom he had a child, but who was so\r\ngreat a termagant and scold, that she was believed to use him very ill, and\r\neven to beat him. He became melancholy in two days from the want of his\r\nusual stimulus to action, and cut his throat on the third so completely,\r\nthat he died immediately.\r\n\r\nMr. Anson, the brother to the late Lord Anson, related to me the following\r\nanecdote of the death of Lord Sc----. His Lordship sent to see Mr. Anson on\r\nthe Monday preceding his death, and said, \"You are the only friend I value\r\nin the world, I determined therefore to acquaint you, that I am tired of\r\nthe insipidity of life, and intend to-morrow to leave it.\" Mr. Anson said,\r\nafter much conversation, that he was obliged to leave town till Friday, and\r\nadded, \"As you profess a friendship for me, do me this last favour, I\r\nentreat you, live till I return.\" Lord Sc---- believed this to be a pious\r\nartifice to gain time, but nevertheless agreed, if he should return by four\r\no'clock on that day. Mr. Anson did not return till five, and found, by the\r\ncountenances of the domestics, that the deed was done. He went into his\r\nchamber and found the corpse of his friend leaning over the arm of a great\r\nchair, with the pistol on the ground by him, the ball of which had been\r\ndischarged into the roof of his mouth, and passed into his brain.\r\n\r\nMr. ---- and Mr. ----, two young men, heirs to considerable fortunes, shot\r\nthemselves at the age of four or five and twenty, without their friends\r\nbeing able to conjecture any cause for those rash actions. One of them I\r\nhad long known to express himself with dissatisfaction of the world; at\r\neighteen years of age he complained, that he could not entertain himself;\r\nhe tried to study the law at Cambridge, and afterwards went abroad for a\r\nyear or two by my advice; but returned dissatisfied with all things. As he\r\nhad had an eruption for some years on a part of his face, which he probably\r\nendeavoured to remove by external applications; I was induced to ascribe\r\nhis perpetual ennui to the pain or disagreeable sensation of a diseased\r\nliver. The other young gentleman shot himself in his bed-room, and I was\r\ninformed that there was found written on a scrap of paper on his table, \"I\r\nam impotent, and therefore not fit to live.\" From whence there was reason\r\nto conclude, that this was the hallucinatio maniacalis, the delirious idea,\r\nwhich caused him to destroy himself. The case therefore belongs to mania\r\nmutabilis, and not to tædium vitæ.\r\n\r\nM. M. Some restraint in exhausting the usual pleasures of the world early\r\nin life. The agreeable cares of a matrimonial life. The cultivation of\r\nscience, as of chemistry, natural philosophy, natural history, which\r\nsupplies an inexhaustible source of pleasurable novelty, and relieves ennui\r\nby the exertions it occasions.\r\n\r\nIn many of these cases, whence irksomeness of life has been the ostensible\r\ncause of suicide, there has probably existed a maniacal hallucination, a\r\npainful idea, which the patient has concealed even to his dying hour;\r\nexcept where the mania has evidently arisen from hereditary or acquired\r\ndisease of the membranous or glandular parts of the system.\r\n\r\n12. _Pulchritudinis desiderium._ The loss of beauty, either by disease, as\r\nby the small-pox, or by age, as life advances, is sometimes painfully felt\r\nby ladies, who have been much flattered on account of it. There is a\r\ncurious case of this kind related in Le Sage's Bachelor of Salamanca, which\r\nis too nicely described to be totally imaginary.\r\n\r\nIn this situation some ladies apply to what are termed cosmetics under\r\nvarious names, which crowd the newspapers. Of these the white has destroyed\r\nthe health of thousands; a calx, or magistery, of bismuth is supposed to be\r\nsold in the shops for this purpose; but it is either, I am informed, in\r\npart or entirely white lead or cerussa. The pernicious effects of the\r\nexternal use of those saturnine applications are spoken of in gutta rosea,\r\nClass II. 1. 4. 6. The real calx of bismuth would probably have the same\r\nill effect. As the red paint is prepared from cochineal, which is an animal\r\nbody, less if any injury arises from its use, as it only lies on the skin\r\nlike other filth.\r\n\r\nThe tan of the skin occasioned by the sun may be removed by lemon juice\r\nevaporated by the fire to half its original quantity, or by diluted marine\r\nacid; which cleans the cuticle, by eroding its surface, but requires much\r\ncaution in the application; the marine acid must be diluted with water, and\r\nwhen put upon the hand or face, after a second of time, as soon as the tan\r\ndisappears, the part must be washed with a wet towel and much warm water.\r\nFreckles lie too deep for this operation, nor are they in general\r\nremoveable by a blister, as I once experienced. See Class I. 2. 2. 9.\r\n\r\nIt is probable, that those materials which stain silk, or ivory, might be\r\nused to stain the cuticle, or hair, permanently; as they are all animal\r\nsubstances. But I do not know, that any trials of this kind have been made\r\non the skin. I endeavoured in vain to whiten the back of my hand by marine\r\nacid oxygenated by manganese, which so instantly whitens cotton.\r\n\r\nThe cure therefore must be sought from moral writers, and the cultivation\r\nof the graces of the mind, which are frequently a more valuable possession\r\nthan celebrated beauty.\r\n\r\n13. _Paupertatis timor._ The fear of poverty is one kind of avarice; it is\r\nliable to affect people who have left off a profitable and active business;\r\nas they are thus deprived of their usual exertions, and are liable to\r\nobserve the daily expenditure of money, without calculating the source from\r\nwhence it flows. It is also liable to occur with a sudden and unexpected\r\nincrease of fortune. Mr. ----, a surgeon, about fifty years of age, who was\r\nalways rather of a parsimonious disposition, had a large house, with a\r\nfortune of forty thousand pounds, left him by a distant relation; and in a\r\nfew weeks became insane from the fear of poverty, lamenting that he should\r\ndie in a jail or workhouse. He had left off a laborious country business,\r\nand the daily perception of profit in his books; he also now saw greater\r\nexpences going forwards in his new house, than he had been accustomed to\r\nobserve, and did not so distinctly see the source of supply; which seems to\r\nhave occasioned the maniacal hallucination.--This idea of approaching\r\npoverty is a very frequent and very painful disease, so as to have induced\r\nmany to become suicides, who were in good circumstances; more perhaps than\r\nany other maniacal hallucination, except the fear of hell.\r\n\r\nThe covetousness of age is more liable to affect single men, than those who\r\nhave families; though an accumulation of wealth would seem to be more\r\ndesirable to the latter. But an old man in the former situation, has no\r\npersonal connections to induce him to open his purse; and having lost the\r\nfriends of his youth, and not easily acquiring new ones, feels himself\r\nalone in the world; feels himself unprotected, as his strength declines,\r\nand is thus led to depend for assistance on money, and on that account\r\nwishes to accumulate it. Whereas the father of a family has not only those\r\nconnections, which demand the frequent expenditure of money, but feels a\r\nconsolation in the friendship of his children, when age may render their\r\ngood offices necessary to him.\r\n\r\nM. M. I have been well informed of a medical person in good circumstances\r\nin London, who always carries an account of his affairs, as debtor and\r\ncreditor, in his pocket-book; and looks over it frequently in a day, when\r\nthis disease returns upon him; and thus, by counteracting the maniacal\r\nhallucination, wisely prevents the increase of his insanity. Another\r\nmedical person, in London, is said to have cured himself of this disease by\r\nstudying mathematics with great attention; which exertions of the mind\r\nrelieved the pain of the maniacal hallucination.\r\n\r\nMany moral writers have stigmatised this insanity; the covetous, they say,\r\ncommit crimes and mortify themselves without hopes of reward; and thus\r\nbecome miserable both in this world and the next. Thus Juvenal:\r\n\r\n  Cum furor haud dubius, cum sit manifesta phrenitis,\r\n  Ut locuples moriaris, egenti vivere fato!\r\n\r\nThe covetous man thought he gave good advice to the spendthrift, when he\r\nsaid, \"Live like me,\" who well answered him,\r\n\r\n  ----------\"Like you, Sir John?\r\n  \"That I can do, when all I have is gone!\"\r\n                          POPE.\r\n\r\n14. _Lethi timor._ The fear of death perpetually employs the thoughts of\r\nthese patients; hence they are devising new medicines, and applying to\r\nphysicians and quacks without number. It is confounded with\r\nhypochondriasis, Class I. 2. 4. 10. in popular conversation, but is in\r\nreality an insanity.\r\n\r\nA young gentleman, whom I advised to go abroad as a cure for this disease,\r\nassured me, that during the three years he was in Italy and France he never\r\npassed a quarter of an hour without fearing he should die. But has now for\r\nabove twenty years experienced the contrary.\r\n\r\nThe sufferers under this malady are generally at once discoverable by their\r\ntelling you, amidst an unconnected description of their complaints, that\r\nthey are nevertheless not afraid of dying. They are also easily led to\r\ncomplain of pains in almost any part of the body, and are thus soon\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\nM. M. As the maniacal hallucination has generally arisen in early infancy\r\nfrom some dreadful account of the struggles and pain of dying, I have\r\nsometimes observed, that these patients have received great consolation\r\nfrom the instances I have related to them of people dying without pain.\r\nSome of these, which I think curious, I shall concisely relate, as a part\r\nof the method of cure.\r\n\r\nMr. ----, an elderly gentleman, had sent for me one whole day before I\r\ncould attend him; on my arrival he said he was glad to see me, but that he\r\nwas now quite well, except that he was weak, but had had a pain in his\r\nbowels the day before. He then lay in bed with his legs cold up to the\r\nknees, his hands and arms cold, and his pulse scarcely discernible, and\r\ndied in about six hours. Mr. ----, another gentleman about sixty, lay in\r\nthe act of dying, with difficult respiration like groaning, but in a kind\r\nof stupor or coma vigil, and every ten or twelve minutes, while I sat by\r\nhim, he waked, looked up, and said, \"who is it groans so, I am sure there\r\nis somebody dying in the room,\" and then sunk again into a kind of sleep.\r\nFrom these two cases there appeared to be no pain in the act of dying,\r\nwhich may afford consolation to all, but particularly to those who are\r\nafflicted with the fear of death.\r\n\r\n15. _Orci timor._ The fear of hell. Many theatric preachers among the\r\nMethodists successfully inspire this terror, and live comfortably upon the\r\nfolly of their hearers. In this kind of madness the poor patients\r\nfrequently commit suicide; although they believe they run headlong into the\r\nhell, which they dread! Such is the power of oratory, and such the debility\r\nof the human understanding!\r\n\r\nThose, who suffer under this insanity, are generally the most innocent and\r\nharmless people; who are then liable to accuse themselves of the greatest\r\nimaginary crimes, and have so much intellectual cowardice, that they dare\r\nnot reason about those things, which they are directed by their priests to\r\nbelieve, however contradictory to human apprehension, or derogatory to the\r\ngreat Creator of all things. The maniacal hallucination at length becomes\r\nso painful, that the poor insane flies from life to become free from it.\r\n\r\nM. M. Where the intellectual cowardice is great, the voice of reason is\r\nineffectual; but that of ridicule may save many from those mad-making\r\ndoctors; though it is too weak to cure those, who are already hallucinated.\r\nFoot's Farces are recommended for this purpose.\r\n\r\n16. _Satyriasis._ An ungovernable desire of venereal indulgence. The remote\r\ncause is probably the stimulus of the semen; whence the phallus becomes\r\ndistended with blood by the arterial propulsion of it being more strongly\r\nexcited than the correspondent venous absorption. At the same time a new\r\nsense is produced in the other termination of the urethra; which, like\r\nitching, requires some exterior friction to facilitate the removal of the\r\ncause of the maniacal actions, which may probably be increased in those\r\ncases by some associated hallucinations of ideas. It differs from\r\npriapismus chronicus in the desire of its appropriated object, which is not\r\nexperienced in the latter, Class I. 1. 4. 6. and from the priapismus\r\namatorius, Class II. 1. 7. 9. in the maniacal actions in consequence of\r\ndesire. The furor uterius, or nymphomania, is a similar disease.\r\n\r\nM. M. Venesection. Cathartics. Torpentia. Marriage.\r\n\r\n17. _Ira._ Anger is caused by the pain of offended pride. We are not angry\r\nat breaking a bone, but become quite insane from the smallest stroke of a\r\nwhip from an inferior. Ira furor brevis. Anger is not only itself a\r\ntemporary madness, but is a frequent attendant on other insanities, and as,\r\nwhenever it appears, it distinguishes insanity from delirium, it is\r\ngenerally a good sign in fevers with debility.\r\n\r\nAn injury voluntarily inflicted on us by others excites our exertions of\r\nself-defence or of revenge against the perpetrator of it; but anger does\r\nnot succeed in any great degree unless our pride is offended; this idea is\r\nthe maniacal hallucination, the pain of which sometimes produces such\r\nviolent and general exertions of our muscles and ideas, as to disappoint\r\nthe revenge we meditate, and vainly to exhaust our sensorial power. Hence\r\nangry people, if not further excited by disagreeable language, are liable\r\nin an hour or two to become humble, and sorry for their violence, and\r\nwilling to make greater concessions than required.\r\n\r\nM. M. Be silent, when you feel yourself angry. Never use loud oaths,\r\nviolent upbraidings, or strong expressions of countenance, or\r\ngesticulations of the arms, or clenched fists; as these by their former\r\nassociations with anger will contribute to increase it. I have been told of\r\na sergeant or corporal, who began moderately to cane his soldiers, when\r\nthey were awkward in their exercise, but being addicted to swearing and\r\ncoarse language, he used soon to enrage himself by his own expressions of\r\nanger, till toward the end he was liable to beat the delinquents\r\nunmercifully.\r\n\r\n18. _Rabies._ Rage. A desire of biting others, most frequently attendant on\r\ncanine madness. Animals in great pain, as in the colica saturnina, are said\r\nto bite the ground they lie upon, and even their own flesh. I have seen\r\npatients bite the attendants, and even their own arms, in the epilepsia\r\ndolorifica. It seems to be an exertion to relieve pain, as explained in\r\nSect. XXXIV. 1. 3. The dread of water in hydrophobia is occasioned by the\r\nrepeated painful attempts to swallow it, and is therefore not an essential\r\nor original part of the disease called canine madness. See Class III. 1. 1.\r\n15.\r\n\r\nThere is a mania reported to exist in some parts of the east, in which a\r\nman is said to run a muck; and these furious maniacs are believed to have\r\ninduced their calamity by unlucky gaming, and afterwards by taking large\r\nquantities of opium; whence the pain of despair is joined with the energy\r\nof drunkenness; they are then said to sally forth into the most populous\r\nstreets, and to wound and slay all they meet, till they receive their own\r\ndeath, which they desire to procure without the greater guilt, as they\r\nsuppose, of suicide.\r\n\r\nM. M. When there appears a tendency to bite in the painful epilepsy, the\r\nend of a rolled-up towel, or a wedge of soft wood, should be put into the\r\nmouth of the patient. As a bullet is said sometimes to be given to a\r\nsoldier, who is to be severely flogged, that he may by biting it better\r\nbear his punishment.\r\n\r\n19. _Citta._ A desire to swallow indigestible substances. I once saw a\r\nyoung lady, about ten years of age, who filled her stomach with the earth\r\nout of a flower-pot, and vomited it up with small stones, bits of wood, and\r\nwings of infects amongst it. She had the bombycinous complexion, and looked\r\nlike a chlorotic patient, though so young; this generally proceeds from an\r\nacid in the stomach.\r\n\r\nM. M. A vomit. Magnesia alba. Armenian bole. Rhubarb. Bark. Steel. A\r\nblister. See Class I. 2. 4. 5.\r\n\r\n20. _Cacositia._ Aversion to food. This may arise, without disease of the\r\nstomach, from connecting nauseous ideas to our usual food, as by calling a\r\nham a hog's a----. This madness is much inculcated by the stoic philosophy.\r\nSee Antoninus' Meditations. See two cases of patients who refused to take\r\nnourishment, Class III. 1. 2. 1.\r\n\r\nAversions to peculiar kinds of food are thus formed early in life by\r\nassociation of some maniacal hallucination with them. I remember a child,\r\nwho on tasting the gristle of sturgeon, asked what gristle was? And being\r\ntold it was like the division of a man's nose, received an ideal\r\nhallucination; and for twenty years afterwards could not be persuaded to\r\ntaste sturgeon.\r\n\r\nThe great fear or aversion, which some people experience at the sight of\r\nspiders, toads, crickets, and the like, have generally had a similar\r\norigin.\r\n\r\nM. M. Associate agreeable ideas with those which disgust; as call a spider\r\ningenious, a frog clean and innocent; and repress all expressions of\r\ndisgust by the countenance, as such expressions contribute to preserve, or\r\neven to increase, the energy of the ideas associated with them; as\r\nmentioned above in Species 17. Ira.\r\n\r\n21. _Syphilis imaginaria._ The fear that they are infested with the\r\nvenereal disease, when they have only deserved it, is a very common\r\ninsanity amongst modest young men; and is not to be cured without applying\r\nartfully to the mind; a little mercury must be given, and hopes of a cure\r\nadded weekly and gradually by interview or correspondence for six or eight\r\nweeks. Many of these patients have been repeatedly salivated without curing\r\nthe mind!\r\n\r\n22. _Psora imaginaria._ I have twice seen an imaginary itch, and twice an\r\nimaginary diabætes, where there was not the least vestige of either of\r\nthose diseases, and once an imaginary deafness, where the patient heard\r\nperfectly well. In all these cases the hallucinated idea is so powerfully\r\nexcited, that it is not to be changed suddenly by occular sensation, or\r\nreason. Yet great perseverance in the frequently presenting contrary ideas\r\nwill sometimes slowly remove this hallucination, or in great length of time\r\noblivion, or forgetfulness, performs a cure, by other means in vain\r\nattempted.\r\n\r\n23. _Tabes imaginaria._ This imaginary disease, or hallucination, is caused\r\nby the supposed too great frequency of parting with the semen, and had long\r\nimposed upon the physician as well as the patient, till Mr. John Hunter\r\nfirst endeavoured to shew, that in general the morbid effects of this\r\npollution was in the imagination; and that those were only liable to those\r\neffects in general, who had been terrified by the villainous books, which\r\npretend to prevent or to cure it, but which were purposely written to vend\r\nsome quack medicine. Most of those unhappy patients, whom I have seen, had\r\nevidently great impression of fear and self-condemnation on their minds,\r\nand might be led to make contradictory complaints in almost any part of the\r\nbody, and if their confessions could be depended on, had not used this\r\npollution to any great excess.\r\n\r\nM. M. 1. Assure them if the loss of the semen happens but twice a week, it\r\nwill not injure them. 2. Marry them. The last is a certain cure; whether\r\nthe disease be real or imaginary. Cold partial bath, and astringent\r\nmedicines frequently taken, only recal the mind to the disease, or to the\r\ndelinquency; and thence increase the imaginary effects and the real cause,\r\nif such exists. Mr. ---- destroyed himself to get free from the pain of\r\nfear of the supposed ill consequences of self-pollution, without any other\r\napparent disease; whose parents I had in vain advised to marry him, if\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n24. _Sympathia aliena._ Pity. Our sympathy with the pleasures and pains of\r\nothers distinguishes men from other animals; and is probably the foundation\r\nof what is termed our moral sense and the source of all our virtues. See\r\nSect. XXII. 3. 3. When our sympathy with those miseries of mankind, which\r\nwe cannot alleviate, rises to excess, the mind becomes its own tormentor;\r\nand we add to the aggregate sum of human misery, which we ought to labour\r\nto diminish; as in the following eloquent lamentation from Akenside's\r\nPleasures of Imagination, Book II. 1. 200.\r\n\r\n  ----------------Dark,\r\n  As midnight storms, the scene of human things\r\n  Appear'd before me; deserts, burning sands,\r\n  Where the parch'd adder dies; the frozen south;\r\n  And desolation blasting all the west\r\n  With rapine and with murder. Tyrant power\r\n  Here sits enthroned in blood; the baleful charms\r\n  Of superstition there infect the skies,\r\n  And turn the sun to horror. Gracious Heaven!\r\n  What is the life of man? Or cannot these,\r\n  Not these portents thy awful will suffice?\r\n  That, propagated thus beyond their scope,\r\n  They rise to act their cruelties anew\r\n  In my afflicted bosom, thus decreed\r\n  The universal sensitive of pain,\r\n  The wretched heir of evils not its own!\r\n\r\nA poet of antiquity, whose name I do not recollect, is said to have written\r\na book describing the miseries of the world, and to have destroyed himself\r\nat the conclusion of his task. This sympathy, with all sensitive beings,\r\nhas been carried so far by some individuals, and even by whole tribes, as\r\nthe Gentoos, as not only to restrain them from killing animals for their\r\nsupport, but even to induce them to permit insects to prey upon their\r\nbodies. Such is however the condition of mortality, that the first law of\r\nnature is, \"Eat or be eaten.\" We cannot long exist without the destruction\r\nof other animal or vegetable beings, either in their mature or their\r\nembryon state. Unless the fruits, which surround the seeds of some\r\nvegetables, or the honey stolen from them by the bee, may be said to be an\r\nexception to this assertion. See Botanic Garden, P. I. Cant. I. l. 278.\r\nNote. Hence, from the necessity of our nature, we may be supposed to have a\r\nright to kill those creatures, which we want to eat, or which want to eat\r\nus. But to destroy even insects wantonly shews an unreflecting mind or a\r\ndepraved heart.\r\n\r\nNevertheless mankind may be well divided into the selfish and the social;\r\nthat is, into those whose pleasures arise from gratifying their appetites,\r\nand those whose pleasures arise from their sympathizing with others. And\r\naccording to the prevalence of these opposing propensities we value or\r\ndislike the possessor of them.\r\n\r\nIn conducting the education of young people, it is a nice matter to inspire\r\nthem with so much benevolent sympathy, or compassion, as may render them\r\ngood and amiable; and yet not so much as to make them unhappy at the sight\r\nof incurable distress. We should endeavour to make them alive to sympathize\r\nwith all remediable evils, and at the same time to arm them with fortitude\r\nto bear the sight of such irremediable evils, as the accidents of life must\r\nfrequently present before their eyes. About this I have treated more at\r\nlarge in a plan for the conduct of a boarding school for ladies, which I\r\nintend to publish in the course of the next year.\r\n\r\n25. _Educatio heroica._ From the kinds and degrees of insanities already\r\nenumerated, the reader will probably recollect many more from his own\r\nobservation; he will perceive that all extraordinary exertions of voluntary\r\naction in consequence of some false idea or hallucination, which strongly\r\naffects us, may philosophically, though not popularly, be termed an\r\ninsanity; he will then be liable to divide these voluntary exertions into\r\ndisagreeable, pernicious, detestable, or into meritorious, delectable, and\r\neven amiable, insanities. And will lastly be induced to conceive, that a\r\ngood education consists in the art of producing such happy hallucinations\r\nof ideas, as may be followed by such voluntary exertions, as may be termed\r\nmeritorious or amiable insanities.\r\n\r\nThe old man of the mountain in Syria, who governed a small nation of people\r\ncalled Assassines, is recorded thus to have educated those of his army who\r\nwere designed to assassinate the princes with whom he was at war. A young\r\nman of natural activity was chosen for the purpose, and thrown into a deep\r\nsleep by opium mixed with his food; he was then carried into a garden made\r\nto represent the paradise of Mahomet, with flowers of great beauty and\r\nfragrance, fruits of delicious flavor, and beautiful houries beckoning him\r\ninto the shades. After a while, on being a second time stupified with\r\nopium, the young enthusiast was reconveyed to his apartment; and on the\r\nnext day was assured by a priest, that he was designed for some great\r\nexploit, and that by obeying the commands of their prince, immortal\r\nhappiness awaited him.\r\n\r\nHence it is easy to collect how the first impressions made on us by\r\naccidental circumstances in our infancy continue through life to bias our\r\naffections, or mislead our judgments. One of my acquaintance can trace the\r\norigin of his own energies of action from some such remote sources; which\r\njustifies the observation of M. Rousseau, that the seeds of future virtues\r\nor vices are oftener sown by the mother, than the tutor.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nORDO II.\r\n\r\n_Decreased Volition._\r\n\r\nGENUS I.\r\n\r\n_With decreased Actions of the Muscles._\r\n\r\nOur muscles become fatigued by long contraction, and cease for a time to be\r\nexcitable by the will; owing to exhaustion of the sensorial power, which\r\nresides in them. After a short interval of relaxation the muscle regains\r\nits power of voluntary contraction; which is probably occasioned by a new\r\nsupply of the spirit of animation. In weaker people these contractions\r\ncease sooner, and therefore recur more frequently, and are attended with\r\nshorter intervals of relaxation, as exemplified in the quickness of the\r\npulse in fevers with debility, and in the tremors of the hands of aged or\r\nfeeble people.\r\n\r\nAfter a common degree of exhaustion of the sensorial power in a muscle, it\r\nbecomes again gradually restored by the rest of the muscle; and even\r\naccumulated in those muscles, which are most frequently used; as in those\r\nwhich constitute the capillaries of the skin after having been rendered\r\ntorpid by cold. But in those muscles, which are generally obedient to\r\nvolition, as those of locomotion, though their usual quantity of sensorial\r\npower is restored by their quiescence, or in sleep (for sleep affects these\r\nparts of the system only), yet but little accumulation of it succeeds. And\r\nthis want of accumulation of the sensorial power in these muscles, which\r\nare chiefly subservient to volition, explains to us one cause of their\r\ngreater tendency to paralytic affection.\r\n\r\nIt must be observed, that those parts of the system, which have been for a\r\ntime quiescent from want of stimulus, as the vessels of the skin, when\r\nexposed to cold, acquire an accumulation of sensorial power during their\r\ninactivity; but this does not happen at all, or in much less quantity, from\r\ntheir quiescence after great expenditure of sensorial power by a previous\r\nexcessive stimulus, as after intoxication. In this case the muscles or\r\norgans of sense gradually acquire their natural quantity of sensorial\r\npower, as after sleep; but not an accumulation or superabundance of it. And\r\nby frequent repetitions of exhaustion by great stimulus, these vessels\r\ncease to acquire their whole natural quantity of sensorial power; as in the\r\nschirrous stomach, and schirrous liver, occasioned by the great and\r\nfrequent stimulus of vinous spirit; which may properly be termed irritative\r\nparalysis of those parts of the system.\r\n\r\nIn the same manner in common palsies the inaction of the paralytic muscle\r\nseems not to be owing to defect of the stimulus of the will, but to\r\nexhaustion of sensorial power. Whence it frequently follows great exertion,\r\nas in Sect. XXXIV. 1. 7. Thus some parts of the system may cease to obey\r\nthe will, as in common paralysis; others may cease to be obedient to\r\nsensation, as in the impotency of age; others to irritation, as in\r\nschirrous viscera; and others to association, as in impediment of speech;\r\nyet though all these may become inexcitable, or dead, in respect to that\r\nkind of stimulus, which has previously exhausted them, whether of volition,\r\nor sensation, or irritation, or association, they may still in many cases\r\nbe excited by the others.\r\n\r\nSPECIES.\r\n\r\n1. _Lassitudo._ Fatigue or weariness after much voluntary exertion. From\r\nthe too great expenditure of sensorial power the muscles are with\r\ndifficulty brought again into voluntary contraction; and seem to require a\r\ngreater quantity or energy of volition for this purpose. At the same time\r\nthey still remain obedient to the stimulus of agreeable sensation, as\r\nappears in tired dancers finding a renovation of their aptitude to motion\r\non the acquisition of an agreeable partner; or from a tired child riding on\r\na gold-headed cane, as in Sect. XXXIV. 2. 6. These muscles are likewise\r\nstill obedient to the sensorial power of association, because the motions,\r\nwhen thus excited, are performed in their designed directions, and are not\r\nbroken into variety of gesticulation, as in St. Vitus's dance.\r\n\r\nA lassitude likewise frequently occurs with yawning at the beginning of\r\nague-fits; where the production of sensorial power in the brain is less\r\nthan its expenditure. For in this case the torpor may either originate in\r\nthe brain, or the torpor of some distant parts of the system may by\r\nsympathy affect the brain, though in a less proportionate degree than the\r\nparts primarily affected.\r\n\r\n2. _Vacillatio senilis._ Some elderly people acquire a see-saw motion of\r\ntheir bodies from one side to the other, as they sit, like the oscillation\r\nof a pendulum. By these motions the muscles, which preserve the\r\nperpendicularity of the body, are alternately quiescent, and exerted; and\r\nare thus less liable to fatigue or exhaustion. This therefore resembles the\r\ntremors of old people above mentioned, and not those spasmodic movements of\r\nthe face or limbs, which are called tricks, described in Class IV. 1. 3. 2.\r\nwhich originate from excess of sensorial power, or from efforts to relieve\r\ndisagreeable sensation, and are afterwards continued by habit.\r\n\r\n3. _Tremor senilis._ Tremor of old age consists of a perpetual trembling of\r\nthe hands, or of the head, or of other muscles, when they are exerted; and\r\nis erroneously called paralytic; and seems owing to the small quantity of\r\nanimal power residing in the muscular fibres. These tremors only exist when\r\nthe affected muscles are excited into action, as in lifting a glass to the\r\nmouth, or in writing, or in keeping the body upright; and cease again, when\r\nno voluntary exertion is attempted, as in lying down. Hence these tremors\r\nevidently originate from the too quick exhaustion of the lessened quantity\r\nof the spirit of animation. So many people tremble from fear or anger, when\r\ntoo great a part of the sensorial power is exerted on the organs of sense,\r\nso as to deprive the muscles, which support the body erect, of their due\r\nquantity.\r\n\r\n4. _Brachiorum paralysis._ A numbness of the arms is a frequent symptom in\r\nhydrops thoracis, as explained in Class I. 2. 3. 14. and in Sect. XXIX. 5.\r\n2.; it also accompanies the asthma dolorificum, Class III. 1. 1. 11. and is\r\nowing probably to the same cause in both. In the colica saturnina a\r\nparalysis affects the wrists, as appears on the patient extending his arm\r\nhorizontally with the palm downwards, and is often attended with a tumor on\r\nthe carpal or metacarpal bones. See Class IV. 1. 2. 10.\r\n\r\nMr. M----, a miner and well-sinker, about three years ago, lost the power\r\nof contracting both his thumbs; the balls or muscles of the thumbs are much\r\nemaciated, and remain paralytic. He ascribes his disease to immersing his\r\nhands too long in cold water in the execution of his business. He says his\r\nhands had frequently been much benumbed before, so that he could not\r\nwithout difficulty clench them; but that they recovered their motion, as\r\nsoon as they began to glow, after he had dried and covered them.\r\n\r\nIn this case there existed two injurious circumstances of different kinds;\r\none the violent and continued action of the muscles, which destroys by\r\nexhausting the sensorial power; and the other, the application of cold,\r\nwhich destroys by defect of stimulus. The cold seems to have contributed to\r\nthe paralysis by its long application, as well as the continued exertion;\r\nbut as during the torpor occasioned by the exposure to cold, if the degree\r\nof it be not so great as to extinguish life, the sensorial power becomes\r\naccumulated; there is reason to believe, that the exposing a paralytic limb\r\nto the cold for a certain time, as by covering it with snow or iced water\r\nfor a few minutes, and then covering it with warm flannel, and this\r\nfrequently repeated, might, by accumulation of sensorial power, contribute\r\nto restore it to a state of voluntary excitability. As this accumulation of\r\nsensorial power, and consequent glow, seems, in the present case, several\r\ntimes to have contributed to restore the numbness or inability of those\r\nmuscles, which at length became paralytic. See Class I. 2. 3. 21.\r\n\r\nM. M. Ether externally. Friction. Saline warm bath. Electricity.\r\n\r\n5. _Raucedo paralytica._ Paralytic hoarseness consists in the almost total\r\nloss of voice, which sometimes continues for months, or even years, and is\r\noccasioned by inability or paralysis of the recurrent nerves, which serve\r\nthe muscles of vocality, by opening or closing the larynx. The voice\r\ngenerally returns suddenly, even so as to alarm the patient. A young lady,\r\nwho had many months been affected with almost a total loss of voice, and\r\nhad in vain tried variety of advice, recovered her voice in an instant, on\r\nsome alarm as she was dancing at an assembly. Was this owing to a greater\r\nexertion of volition than usual? like the dumb young man, the son of\r\nCroesus, who is related to have cried out, when he saw his father's life\r\nendangered by the sword of his enemy, and to have continued to speak ever\r\nafterwards. Two young ladies in this complaint seemed to be cured by\r\nelectric shocks passed through the larynx every day for a fortnight. See\r\nRaucedo catarrhalis, Class II. 1. 3. 5.\r\n\r\nM. M. An emetic. Electric shocks. Mustard-seed, a large spoonful swallowed\r\nwhole, or a little bruised, every morning. Valerian. Burnt sponge. Blisters\r\non each side of the larynx. Sea-bathing. A gargle of decoction of seneca.\r\nFriction. Frequent endeavours to shout and sing.\r\n\r\n6. _Vesicæ urinariæ paralysis._ Paralysis of the bladder is frequently a\r\nsymptom in inirritative fever; in this case the patient makes no water for\r\na day or two; and the tumor of the bladder distended with urine may be seen\r\nby the shape of the abdomen, as if girt by a cord below the navel, or\r\ndistinguished by the hand. Many patients in this situation make no\r\ncomplaint, and suffer great injury by the inattention of their attendants;\r\nthe water must be drawn off once or twice a day by means of a catheter, and\r\nthe region of the bladder gently pressed by the hand, whilst the patient be\r\nkept in a sitting or erect posture.\r\n\r\nM. M. Bark. Wine. Opium, a quarter of a grain every six hours. Balsam of\r\ncopaiva or of Peru. Tincture of cantharides 20 drops twice a day, or\r\nrepeated small blisters.\r\n\r\n7. _Recti paralysis._ Palsy of the rectum. The rectum intestinum, like the\r\nurinary bladder in the preceding article, possesses voluntary power of\r\nmotion; though these volitions are at times uncontrollable by the will,\r\nwhen the acrimony of the contained feces, or their bulk, stimulate it to a\r\ngreater degree. Hence it happens, that this part is liable to lose its\r\nvoluntary power by paralysis, but is still liable to be stimulated into\r\naction by the contained feces. This frequently occurs in fevers, and is a\r\nbad sign as a symptom of general debility; and it is the sensibility of the\r\nmuscular fibres of this and of the urinary bladder remaining, after the\r\nvoluntarity has ceased, which occasions these two reservoirs so soon to\r\nregain, as the fever ceases, their obedience to volition; because the\r\nparalysis is thus shewn to be less complete in those cases than in common\r\nhemiplegia; as in the latter the sense of touch, though perhaps not the\r\nsense of pain, is generally destroyed in the paralytic limb.\r\n\r\nM. M. A sponge introduced within the sphincter ani to prevent the constant\r\ndischarge, which should have a string put through it, by which it may be\r\nretracted.\r\n\r\n8. _Paresis voluntaria._ Indolence; or inaptitude to voluntary action. This\r\ndebility of the exertion of voluntary efforts prevents the accomplishment\r\nof all great events in life. It often originates from a mistaken education,\r\nin which pleasure or flattery is made the immediate motive of action, and\r\nnot future advantage; or what is termed duty. This observation is of great\r\nvalue to those, who attend to the education of their own children. I have\r\nseen one or two young married ladies of fortune, who perpetually became\r\nuneasy, and believed themselves ill, a week after their arrival in the\r\ncountry, and continued so uniformly during their stay; yet on their return\r\nto London or Bath immediately lost all their complaints, and this\r\nrepeatedly; which I was led to ascribe to their being in their infancy\r\nsurrounded with menial attendants, who had flattered them into the\r\nexertions they then used. And that in their riper years, they became torpid\r\nfor want of this stimulus, and could not amuse themselves by any voluntary\r\nemployment; but required ever after, either to be amused by other people,\r\nor to be flattered into activity. This I suppose, in the other sex, to have\r\nsupplied one source of ennui and suicide.\r\n\r\n9. _Catalepsis_ is sometimes used for fixed spasmodic contractions or\r\ntetanus, as described in Sect. XXXIV. 1. 5. and in Class III. 1. 1. 13. but\r\nis properly simply an inaptitude to muscular motion, the limbs remaining in\r\nany attitude in which they are placed. One patient, whom I saw in this\r\nsituation, had taken much mercury, and appeared universally torpid. He sat\r\nin a chair in any posture he was put, and held a glass to his mouth for\r\nmany minutes without attempting to drink, or withdrawing his hand. He never\r\nspoke, and it was at first necessary to compel him to drink broth; he\r\nrecovered in a few weeks without relapse.\r\n\r\n10. _Hemiplegia._ Palsy of one side consists in the total disobedience of\r\nthe affected muscles to the power of volition. As the voluntary motions are\r\nnot perpetually exerted, there is little sensorial power accumulated during\r\ntheir quiescence, whence they are less liable to recover from torpor, and\r\nare thus more frequently left paralytic, or disobedient to the power of\r\nvolition, though they are sometimes still alive to painful sensation, as to\r\nthe prick of a pin, and to heat; also to irritation, as in stretching and\r\nyawning; or to electric shocks. Where the paralysis is complete the patient\r\nseems gradually to learn to use his limbs over again by repeated efforts,\r\nas in infancy; and, as time is required for this purpose, it becomes\r\ndifficult to know, whether the cure is owing to the effect of medicines, or\r\nto the repeated efforts of the voluntary power.\r\n\r\nThe dispute, whether the nerves decussate or cross each other before they\r\nleave the cavities of the skull or spine, seems to be decided in the\r\naffirmative by comparative anatomy; as the optic nerves of some fish have\r\nbeen shewn evidently to cross each other; as seen by Haller, Elem. Physiol.\r\nt. v. p. 349. Hence the application of blisters, or of ether, or of warm\r\nfomentations, should be on the side of the head opposite to that of the\r\naffected muscles. This subject should nevertheless be nicely determined,\r\nbefore any one should trepan for the hydrocephalus internus, when the\r\ndisease is shewn to exist only on one side of the brain, by a squinting\r\naffecting but one eye; as proposed in Class I. 2. 5. 4. Dr. Sommering has\r\nshewn, that a true decussation of the optic nerves in the human subject\r\nactually exists, Elem. of Physiology by Blumenbach, translated by C.\r\nCaldwell, Philadelphia. This further appears probable from the oblique\r\ndirection and insertion of each optic nerve, into the side of the eye next\r\nto the nose, in a direct line from the opposite side of the brain.\r\n\r\nThe vomiting, which generally attends the attack of hemiplegia, is\r\nmentioned in Sect. XX. 8. and is similar to that attending vertigo in\r\nsea-sickness, and at the commencement of some fevers. Black stools\r\nsometimes attend the commencement of hemiplegia, which is probably an\r\neffusion of blood from the biliary duct, where the liver is previously\r\naffected; or some blood may be derived to the intestines by its escaping\r\nfrom the vena cava into the receptacle of chyle during the distress of the\r\nparalytic attack; and may be conveyed from thence into the intestines by\r\nthe retrograde motions of the lacteals; as probably sometimes happens in\r\ndiabætes. See Sect. XXVII. 2. Palsy of one side of the face is mentioned in\r\nClass II. 1. 4. 6. Paralysis of the lacteals, of the liver, and of the\r\nveins, which are described in Sect. XXVIII. XXX. and XXVII. do not belong\r\nto this class, as they are not diseases of voluntary motions.\r\n\r\nM. M. The electric sparks and shocks, if used early in the disease, are\r\nfrequently of service. A purge of aloes, or calomel. A vomit. Blister.\r\nSaline draughts. Then the bark. Mercurial ointment or sublimate, where the\r\nliver is evidently diseased; or where the gutta rosea has previously\r\nexisted. Sudden alarm. Frequent voluntary efforts. Externally ether.\r\nVolatile alcali. Fomentation on the head. Friction. When children, who have\r\nsuffered an hemiplegia, begin to use the affected arm, the other hand\r\nshould be tied up for half an hour three or four times a day; which obliges\r\nthem at their play to use more frequent voluntary efforts with the diseased\r\nlimb, and thus sooner to restore the dissevered associations of motion.\r\n\r\nDr. J. Alderson has lately much recommended the leaves of rhus toxicodendon\r\n(sumach), from one gr. to iv. of the dried powder to be taken three or four\r\ntimes a day. Essay on Rhus Toxic. Johnson, London, 1793. But it is\r\ndifficult to know what medicine is of service, as the movements of the\r\nmuscles must be learned, as in infancy, by frequent efforts.\r\n\r\n11. _Paraplegia._ A palsy of the lower half of the body divided\r\nhorizontally. Animals may be conceived to have double bodies, one half in\r\ngeneral resembling so exactly the other, and being supplied with separate\r\nsets of nerves; this gives rise to hemiplegia, or palsy of one half of the\r\nbody divided vertically; but the paraplegia, or palsy of the lower parts of\r\nthe system, depends on an injury of the spinal marrow, or that part of the\r\nbrain which is contained in the vertebræ of the back; by which all the\r\nnerves situated below the injured part are deprived of their nutriment, or\r\nprecluded from doing their proper offices; and the muscles, to which they\r\nare derived, are in consequence disobedient to the power of volition.\r\n\r\nThis sometimes occurs from an external injury, as a fall from an eminence;\r\nof which I saw a deplorable instance, where the bladder and rectum, as well\r\nas the lower limbs, were deprived of so much of their powers of motion, as\r\ndepended on volition or sensation; but I suppose not of that part of it,\r\nwhich depends on irritation. In the same manner as the voluntary muscles in\r\nhemiplegia are sometimes brought into action by irritation, as in\r\nstretching or pendiculation, described in Sect. VII. 1. 3.\r\n\r\nBut the most frequent cause of paraplegia is from a protuberance of one of\r\nthe spinal vertebræ; which is owing to the innutrition or softness of\r\nbones, described in Class I. 2. 2. 17. The cure of this deplorable disease\r\nis frequently effected by the stimulus of an issue placed on each side of\r\nthe prominent spine, as first published by Mr. Pott. The other means\r\nrecommended in softness of bones should also be attended to; both in\r\nrespect to the internal medicines, and to the mechanical methods of\r\nsupporting, or extending the spine; which last, however, in this case\r\nrequires particular caution.\r\n\r\n12. _Somnus._ In sleep all voluntary power is suspended, see Sect. XVIII.\r\nAn unusual quantity of sleep is often produced by weakness. In this case\r\nsmall doses of opium, wine, and bark, may be given with advantage. For the\r\nperiods of sleep, see Class IV. 2. 4. 1.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent ingenious observations on the frequency of the pulse, which\r\nsometimes occurs in sleep, are copied from a letter of Dr. Currie of\r\nLiverpool to the author.\r\n\r\n    \"Though rest in general perhaps renders the healthy pulse slower, yet\r\n    under certain circumstances the contrary is the truth. A full meal\r\n    without wine or other strong liquor does not increase the frequency of\r\n    my pulse, while I sit upright, and have my attention engaged. But if I\r\n    take a recumbent posture after eating, my pulse becomes more frequent,\r\n    especially if my mind be vacant, and I become drowsy; and, if I\r\n    slumber, this increased frequency is more considerable with heat and\r\n    flushing.\r\n\r\n    \"This I apprehend to be a general truth. The observation may be\r\n    frequently made upon children; and the restless and feverish nights\r\n    experienced by many people after a full supper are, I believe, owing to\r\n    this cause. The supper occasions no inconvenience, whilst the person is\r\n    upright and awake; but, when he lies down and begins to sleep,\r\n    especially if he does not perspire, the symptoms above mentioned occur.\r\n    Which may be thus explained in part from your principles. When the\r\n    power of volition is abolished, the other sensorial actions are\r\n    increased. In ordinary sleep this does not occasion increased frequency\r\n    of the pulse; but where sleep takes place during the process of\r\n    digestion, the digestion itself goes on with increased rapidity. Heat\r\n    is excited in the system faster than it is expended; and operating on\r\n    the sensitive actions, it carries them beyond the limitation of\r\n    pleasure, producing, as is common in such cases, increased frequency of\r\n    pulse.\r\n\r\n    \"It is to be observed, that in speaking of the heat generated under\r\n    these circumstances, I do not allude to any chemical evolution of heat\r\n    from the food in the process of digestion. I doubt if this takes place\r\n    to any considerable degree, for I do not observe that the parts\r\n    incumbent on the stomach are increased in heat during the most hurried\r\n    digestion. It is on some parts of the surface, but more particularly on\r\n    the extremities of the body, that the increased heat excited by\r\n    digestion appears, and the heat thus produced arises, as it should\r\n    seem, from the sympathy between the stomach and the vessels of the\r\n    skin. The parts most affected are the palms of the hands and the soles\r\n    of the feet. Even there the thermometer seldom rises above 97 or 98\r\n    degrees, a temperature not higher than that of the trunk of the body;\r\n    but three or four degrees higher than the common temperature of these\r\n    parts, and therefore producing an uneasy sensation of heat, a sensation\r\n    increased by the great sensibility of the parts affected.\r\n\r\n    \"That the increased heat excited by digestion in sleep is the cause of\r\n    the accompanying fever, seems to be confirmed by observing, that if an\r\n    increased expenditure of heat accompanies the increased generation of\r\n    it (as when perspiration on the extremities or surface attends this\r\n    kind of sleep) the frequent pulse and flushed countenance do not occur,\r\n    as I know by experiment. If, during the feverish sleep already\r\n    mentioned, I am awakened, and my attention engaged powerfully, my pulse\r\n    becomes almost immediately slower, and the fever gradually subsides.\"\r\n\r\nFrom these observations of Dr. Currie it appears, that, while in common\r\nsleep the actions of the heart, arteries, and capillaries, are strengthened\r\nby the accumulation of sensorial power during the suspension of voluntary\r\naction, and the pulse in consequence becomes fuller and slower; in the\r\nfeverish sleep above described the actions of the heart, arteries, and\r\ncapillaries, are quickened as well as strengthened by their consent with\r\nthe increased actions of the stomach, as well as by the stimulus of the new\r\nchyle introduced into the circulation. For the stomach, and all other parts\r\nof the system, being more sensible and more irritable during sleep, Sect.\r\nXVIII. 15. and probably more ready to act from association, are now exerted\r\nwith greater velocity as well as strength, constituting a temporary fever\r\nof the sensitive irritated kind, resembling the fever excited by wine in\r\nthe beginning of intoxication; or in some people by a full meal in their\r\nwaking hours. Sect. XXXV. 1.\r\n\r\nOn waking, this increased sensibility and irritability of the system ceases\r\nby the renewed exertions of volition; in the same manner as more violent\r\nexertions of volition destroy greater pains; and the pulse in consequence\r\nsubsides along with the increase of heat; if more violent efforts of\r\nvolition are exerted, the system becomes still less affected by sensation\r\nor irritation. Hence the fever and vertigo of intoxication are lessened by\r\nintense thinking, Sect. XXI. 8; and insane people are known to bear the\r\npain of cold and hunger better than others, Sect. XXXIV. 2. 5; and lastly,\r\nif greater voluntary efforts exist, as in violent anger or violent\r\nexercise, the whole system is thrown into more energetic action, and a\r\nvoluntary fever is induced, as appears by the red skin, quickened pulse,\r\nand increase of heat; whence dropsies and fevers with debility are not\r\nunfrequently removed by insanity.\r\n\r\nHence the exertion of the voluntary power in its natural degree diminishes\r\nthe increased sensibility, and irritability, and probably the increased\r\nassociability, which occurs during sleep; and thus reduces the frequency of\r\nthe pulse in the feverish sleep after a full meal. In its more powerful\r\nstate of exertion, it diminishes or destroys sensations and irritations,\r\nwhich are stronger than natural, as in intoxication, or which precede\r\nconvulsions, or insanity. In its still more powerful degree, the\r\nsuperabundance of this sensorial power actuates and invigorates the whole\r\nmoving system, giving strength and frequency to the pulse, and an universal\r\nglow both of colour and of heat, as in violent anger, or outrageous\r\ninsanities.\r\n\r\nIf, in the feverish sleep above described, the skin becomes cooled by the\r\nevaporation of much perspirable matter, or by the application of cooler\r\nair, or thinner clothes, the actions of the cutaneous capillaries are\r\nlessened by defect of the stimulus of heat, which counteracts the increase\r\nof sensibility during sleep, and the pulsations of the heart and arteries\r\nbecome slower from the lessened stimulus of the particles of blood thus\r\ncooled in the cutaneous and pulmonary vessels. Hence the admission of cold\r\nair, or ablution with subtepid or with cold water, in fevers with hot skin,\r\nwhether they be attended with arterial strength, or arterial debility,\r\nrenders the pulse slower; in the former case by diminishing the stimulus of\r\nthe blood, and in the latter by lessening the expenditure of sensorial\r\npower. See Suppl. I. 8. and 15.\r\n\r\n13. _Incubus._ The night-mare is an imperfect sleep, where the desire of\r\nlocomotion is vehement, but the muscles do not obey the will; it is\r\nattended with great uneasiness, a sense of suffocation, and frequently with\r\nfear. It is caused by violent fatigue, or drunkenness, or indigestible\r\nfood, or lying on the back, or perhaps from many other kinds of uneasiness\r\nin our sleep, which may originate either from the body or mind.\r\n\r\nNow as the action of respiration is partly voluntary, this complaint may be\r\nowing to the irritability of the system being too small to carry on the\r\ncirculation of the blood through the lungs during sleep, when the voluntary\r\npower is suspended. Whence the blood may accumulate in them, and a painful\r\noppression supervene; as in some hæmorrhages of the lungs, which occur\r\nduring sleep; and in patients much debilitated by fevers. See Somnus\r\ninterruptus, Class I. 2. 1. 3. and I. 2. 1. 9.\r\n\r\nGreat fatigue with a full supper and much wine, I have been well informed\r\nby one patient, always produced this disease in himself to a great degree.\r\nNow the general irritability of the system is much decreased by fatigue, as\r\nit exhausts the sensorial power; and secondly, too much wine and\r\nstimulating food will again diminish the irritability of some parts of the\r\nsystem, by employing a part of the sensorial power, which is already too\r\nsmall, in digesting a great quantity of aliment; and in increasing the\r\nmotions of the organs of sense in consequence of some degree of\r\nintoxication, whence difficulty of breathing may occur from the\r\ninirritability of the lungs, as in Class I. 2. 1. 3.\r\n\r\nM. M. To sleep on a hard bed with the head raised. Moderate supper. The\r\nbark. By sleeping on a harder bed the patient will turn himself more\r\nfrequently, and not be liable to sleep too profoundly, or lie too long in\r\none posture. To be awakened frequently by an alarm clock.\r\n\r\n14. _Lethargus._ The lethargy is a slighter apoplexy. It is supposed to\r\noriginate from universal pressure on the brain, and is said to be produced\r\nby compressing the spinal marrow, where there is a deficiency of the bone\r\nin the spina bifida. See Sect. XVIII. 20. Whereas in the hydrocephalus\r\nthere is only a partial pressure of the brain; and probably in nervous\r\nfevers with stupor the pressure on the brain may affect only the nerves of\r\nthe senses, which lie within the skull, and not those nerves of the medulla\r\noblongata, which principally contribute to move the heart and arteries;\r\nwhence in the lethargic or apoplectic stupor the pulse is slow as in sleep,\r\nwhereas in nervous fever the pulse is very quick and feeble, and generally\r\nso in hydrocephalus.\r\n\r\nIn cases of obstructed kidneys, whether owing to the tubuli uriniferi being\r\ntotally obstructed by calculous matter, or by their paralysis, a kind of\r\ndrowsiness or lethargy comes on about the eighth or ninth day, and the\r\npatient gradually sinks. See Class I. 1. 3. 9.\r\n\r\n15. _Syncope epileptica_, is a temporary apoplexy, the pulse continuing in\r\nits natural state, and the voluntary power suspended. This terminates the\r\nparoxysms of epilepsy.\r\n\r\nWhen the animal power is much exhausted by the preceding convulsions, so\r\nthat the motions from sensation as well as those from volition are\r\nsuspended; in a quarter or half an hour the sensorial power becomes\r\nrestored, and if no pain, or irritation producing pain, recurs, the fit of\r\nepilepsy ceases; if the pain recurs, or the irritation, which used to\r\nproduce it, a new fit of convulsion takes place, and is succeeded again by\r\na syncope. See Epilepsy, Class III. 1. 1. 7.\r\n\r\n16. _Apoplexia._ Apoplexy may be termed an universal palsy, or a permanent\r\nsleep. In which, where the pulse is weak, copious bleeding must be\r\ninjurious; as is well observed by Dr. Heberden, Trans. of the College.\r\n\r\nMr. ----, about 70 years of age, had an apoplectic seizure. His pulse was\r\nstrong and full. One of the temporal arteries was opened, and about ten\r\nounces of blood suddenly taken from it. He seemed to receive no benefit\r\nfrom this operation; but gradually sunk, and lived but a day or two.\r\n\r\nIf apoplexy arises from the pressure of blood extravasated on the brain,\r\none moderate venesection may be of service to prevent the further effusion\r\nof blood; but copious venesection must be injurious by weakening the\r\npatient; since the effused blood must have time, as in common vibices or\r\nbruises, to undergo a chemico-animal process, so to change its nature as to\r\nfit it for absorption; which may take two or three weeks, which time a\r\npatient weakened by repeated venesection or arteriotomy may not survive.\r\n\r\nMrs. ----, about 40 years old, had an apoplectic seizure after great\r\nexertion from fear; she had lain about 24 hours without speech, or having\r\nswallowed any liquid. She was then forcibly raised in bed, and a spoonful\r\nof solution of aloes in wine put into her mouth, and the end of the spoon\r\nwithdrawn, that she might more easily swallow the liquid.--This was done\r\nevery hour, with broth, and wine and water intervening, till evacuations\r\nwere procured; which with other means had good effect, and she recovered,\r\nexcept that a considerable degree of hemiplegia remained, and some\r\nimperfection of her speech.\r\n\r\nMany people, who have taken so much vinous spirit as to acquire the\r\ntemporary apoplexy of intoxication, and are not improperly said to be\r\ndead-drunk, have died after copious venesection, I suppose in consequence\r\nof it. I once saw at a public meeting two gentlemen in the drunken\r\napoplexy; they were totally insensible with low pulse, on this account they\r\nwere directed not to lose blood, but to be laid on a bed with their heads\r\nhigh, and to be turned every half hour; as soon as they could swallow, warm\r\ntea was given them, which evacuated their stomachs, and they gradually\r\nrecovered, as people do from less degrees of intoxication.\r\n\r\nM. M. Cupping on the occiput. Venesection once in moderate quantity. Warm\r\nfomentations long continued and frequently repeated on the shaved head.\r\nSolution of aloes. Clysters with solution of aloe and oil of amber. A\r\nblister on the spine. An emetic. Afterwards the bark, and small doses of\r\nchalybeates. Small electric shocks through the head. Errhines. If small\r\ndoses of opium?\r\n\r\n17. _Mors a frigore._ Death from cold. The unfortunate travellers, who\r\nalmost every winter perish in the snow, are much exhausted by their efforts\r\nto proceed on their journey, as well as benumbed by cold. And as much\r\ngreater exercise can be borne without fatigue in cold weather than in warm;\r\nbecause the excessive motions of the cutaneous vessels are thus prevented,\r\nand the consequent waste of sensorial power; it may be inferred, that the\r\nfatigued traveller becomes paralytic from violent exertion as well as by\r\nthe application of cold.\r\n\r\nGreat degrees of cold affect the motions of those vessels most, which have\r\nbeen generally excited into action by irritation; for when the feet are\r\nmuch benumbed by cold, and painful, and at the same time almost insensible\r\nto the touch of external objects, the voluntary muscles retain their\r\nmotions, and we continue to walk on; the same happens to the fingers of\r\nchildren in throwing snow-balls, the voluntary motions of the muscles\r\ncontinue, though those of the cutaneous vessels are benumbed into\r\ninactivity.\r\n\r\nMr. Thompson, an elderly gentleman of Shrewsbury, was seized with\r\nhemiplegia in the cold bath; which I suppose might be owing to some great\r\nenergy of exertion, as much as to the coldness of the water. As in the\r\ninstance given of Mr. Nairn, who, by the exertion to save his relation,\r\nperished himself. See Sect. XXXIV. 1. 7.\r\n\r\nWhence I conclude, that though heat is a fluid necessary to muscular\r\nmotion, both perhaps by its stimulus, and by its keeping the minute\r\ncomponent parts of the ultimate fibrils of the muscles or organs of sense\r\nat a proper distance from each other; yet that paralysis, properly so\r\ncalled, is the consequence of exhaustion of sensorial power by exertion.\r\nAnd that the accumulations of it during the torpor of the cutaneous vessels\r\nby exposure to cold, or of some internal viscus in the cold fits of agues,\r\nare frequently instrumental in recovering the use of paralytic limbs, or of\r\nthe motions of other paralytic parts of the system. See Spec. 4. of this\r\ngenus.\r\n\r\nAnimal bodies resist the power of cold probably by their exertions in\r\nconsequence of the pain of cold, see Botan. Gard. V. 1. additional note\r\nxii. But if these increased exertions be too violent, so as to exhaust the\r\nsensorial power in producing unnecessary motions, the animal will probably\r\nsooner perish. Thus a moderate quantity of wine or spirit repeated at\r\nproper intervals of time might be of service to those, who are long exposed\r\nto excessive cold, both by increasing the action of the capillary vessels,\r\nand thus producing heat, and perhaps by increasing in some degree the\r\nsecretion of sensorial power in the brain. But the contrary must happen\r\nwhen taken immoderately, and not at due intervals. A well attested history\r\nwas once related to me of two men, who set out on foot to travel in the\r\nsnow, one of whom drank two or three glasses of brandy before they began\r\ntheir journey, the other contented himself with his usual diet and\r\npotation; the former of whom perished in spite of any assistance his\r\ncompanion could afford him; and the other performed his journey with\r\nsafety. In this case the sensorial power was exhausted by the unnecessary\r\nmotions of incipient intoxication by the stimulus of the brandy, as well as\r\nby the exertions of walking; which so weakened the dram-drinker, that the\r\ncold sooner destroyed him; that is, he had not power to produce sufficient\r\nmuscular or arterial action, and in consequence sufficient heat, to supply\r\nthe great expenditure of it. Hence the capillaries of the skin first cease\r\nto act, and become pale and empty; next those which are immediately\r\nassociated with them, as the extremities of the pulmonary artery, as\r\nhappens on going into the cold bath. By the continued inaction of these\r\nparts of the vascular system the blood becomes accumulated in the internal\r\narteries, and the brain is supposed to be affected by its compression;\r\nbecause these patients are said to sleep, or to become apoplectic, before\r\nthey die. I overtook a fishman asleep on his panniers on a very cold frosty\r\nnight, but on waking him he did not appear to be in any degree of stupor.\r\nSee Class I. 2. 2. 1.\r\n\r\nWhen travellers are benighted in deep snow, they might frequently be saved\r\nby covering themselves in it, except a small aperture for air; in which\r\nsituation the lives of hares, sheep, and other animals, are so often\r\npreserved. The snow, both in respect to its component parts, and to the air\r\ncontained in its pores, is a bad conductor of heat, and will therefore well\r\nkeep out the external cold; and as the water, when part of it dissolves, is\r\nattracted into the pores of the remainder of it, the situation of an animal\r\nbeneath it is perfectly dry; and, if he is in contact with the earth, he is\r\nin a degree of heat between 48, the medium heat of the earth, and 32, the\r\nfreezing point; that is, in 40 degrees of heat, in which a man thus covered\r\nwill be as warm as in bed. See Botan. Garden, V. II. notes on Anemone,\r\nBarometz, and Muschus. If these facts were more generally understood, it\r\nmight annually save the lives of many.\r\n\r\nAfter any part of the vascular system of the body has been long exposed to\r\ncold, the sensorial power is so much accumulated in it, that on coming into\r\na warm room the pain of hotach is produced, and inflammation, and\r\nconsequent mortification, owing to the great exertion of those vessels,\r\nwhen again exposed to a moderate degree of warmth. See Sect. XII. 5. Whence\r\nthe propriety of applying but very low degrees of heat to limbs benumbed\r\nwith cold at first, as of snow in its state of dissolving, which is at 32\r\ndegrees of heat, or of very cold water. A French writer has observed, that\r\nif frozen apples be thawed gradually by covering them with thawing snow, or\r\nimmersing them in very cold water, that they do not lose their taste; if\r\nthis fact was well ascertained, it might teach us how to preserve other\r\nripe fruits in ice-houses for winter consumption.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nORDO II.\r\n\r\n_Decreased Volition._\r\n\r\nGENUS II.\r\n\r\n_With decreased Actions of the Organs of Sense._\r\n\r\nSPECIES.\r\n\r\n1. _Recollectionis jactura._ Loss of recollection. This is the defect of\r\nmemory in old people, who forget the actions of yesterday, being incapable\r\nof voluntary recollection, and yet remember those of their youth, which by\r\nfrequent repetition are introduced by association or suggestion. This is\r\nproperly the paralysis of the mind; the organs of sense do not obey the\r\nvoluntary power; that is, our ideas cannot be recollected, or acted over\r\nagain by the will.\r\n\r\nAfter an apoplectic attack the patients, on beginning to recover, find\r\nthemselves most at a loss in recollecting proper names of persons or\r\nplaces; as those words have not been so frequently associated with the\r\nideas they stand for, as the common words of a language. Mr. ----, a man of\r\nstrong mind, of a short necked family, many of whom had suffered by\r\napoplexy, after an apoplectic fit on his recovering the use of speech,\r\nafter repeated trials to remember the name of a person or place, applauded\r\nhimself, when he succeeded, with such a childish smile on the partial\r\nreturn of his sagacity, as very much affected me.--Not long, alas! to\r\nreturn; for another attack in a few weeks destroyed the whole.\r\n\r\nI saw a child after the small-pox, which was left in this situation; it was\r\nlively, active, and even vigorous; but shewed that kind of surprise, which\r\nnovelty excites, at every object it viewed; and that as often as it viewed\r\nit. I never heard the termination of the case.\r\n\r\n2. _Stultitia voluntaria._ Voluntary folly. The absence of voluntary power\r\nand consequent incapacity to compare the ideas of present and future good.\r\nBrute animals may be said to be in this situation, as they are in general\r\nexcited into action only by their present painful or pleasurable\r\nsensations. Hence though they are liable to surprise, when their passing\r\ntrains of ideas are dissevered by violent stimuli; yet are they not\r\naffected with wonder or astonishment at the novelty of objects; as they\r\npossess but in a very inferior degree, that voluntary power of comparing\r\nthe present ideas with those previously acquired, which distinguishes\r\nmankind; and is termed analogical reasoning, when deliberatively exerted;\r\nand intuitive analogy, when used without our attention to it, and which\r\nalways preserves our hourly trains of ideas consistent with truth and\r\nnature. See Sect. XVII. 3. 7.\r\n\r\n3. _Credulitas._ Credulity. Life is short, opportunities of knowledge rare;\r\nour senses are fallacious, our reasonings uncertain, mankind therefore\r\nstruggles with perpetual error from the cradle to the coffin. He is\r\nnecessitated to correct experiment by analogy, and analogy by experiment;\r\nand not always to rest satisfied in the belief of facts even with this\r\ntwo-fold testimony, till future opportunities, or the observations of\r\nothers, concur in their support.\r\n\r\nIgnorance and credulity have ever been companions, and have misled and\r\nenslaved mankind; philosophy has in all ages endeavoured to oppose their\r\nprogress, and to loosen the shackles they had imposed; philosophers have on\r\nthis account been called unbelievers: unbelievers of what? of the fictions\r\nof fancy, of witchcraft, hobgobblins, apparitions, vampires, fairies; of\r\nthe influence of stars on human actions, miracles wrought by the bones of\r\nsaints, the flights of ominous birds, the predictions from the bowels of\r\ndying animals, expounders of dreams, fortune-tellers, conjurors, modern\r\nprophets, necromancy, cheiromancy, animal magnetism, with endless variety\r\nof folly? These they have disbelieved and despised, but have ever bowed\r\ntheir hoary heads to Truth and Nature.\r\n\r\nMankind may be divided in respect to the facility of their belief or\r\nconviction into two classes; those, who are ready to assent to single facts\r\nfrom the evidence of their senses, or from the serious assertions of\r\nothers; and those, who require analogy to corroborate or authenticate them.\r\n\r\nOur first knowledge is acquired by our senses; but these are liable to\r\ndeceive us, and we learn to detect these deceptions by comparing the ideas\r\npresented to us by one sense with those presented by another. Thus when we\r\nfirst view a cylinder, it appears to the eye as a flat surface with\r\ndifferent shades on it, till we correct this idea by the sense of touch,\r\nand find its surface to be circular; that is, having some parts gradually\r\nreceding further from the eye than others. So when a child, or a cat, or a\r\nbird, first sees its own image in a looking-glass, it believes that another\r\nanimal exists before it, and detects this fallacy by going behind the glass\r\nto examine, if another tangible animal really exists there.\r\n\r\nAnother exuberant source of error consists in the false notions, which we\r\nreceive in our early years from the design or ignorance of our instructors,\r\nwhich affect all our future reasoning by their perpetual intrusions; as\r\nthose habits of muscular actions of the face or limbs, which are called\r\ntricks, when contracted in infancy continue to the end of our lives.\r\n\r\nA third great source of error is the vivacity of our ideas of imagination,\r\nwhich perpetually intrude themselves by various associations, and compose\r\nthe farrago of our dreams; in which, by the suspension of volition, we are\r\nprecluded from comparing the ideas of one sense with those of another, or\r\nthe incongruity of their successions with the usual course of nature, and\r\nthus to detect their fallacy. Which we do in our waking hours by a\r\nperpetual voluntary exertion, a process of the mind above mentioned, which\r\nwe have termed intuitive analogy. Sect. XVII. 3. 7.\r\n\r\nThis analogy presupposes an acquired knowledge of things, hence children\r\nand ignorant people are the most credulous, as not possessing much\r\nknowledge of the usual course of nature; and secondly, those are most\r\ncredulous, whose faculty of comparing ideas, or the voluntary exertion of\r\nit, is slow or imperfect. Thus if the power of the magnetic needle of\r\nturning towards the north, or the shock given by touching both sides of an\r\nelectrized coated jar, was related for the first time to a philosopher, and\r\nto an ignorant person; the former would be less ready to believe them, than\r\nthe latter; as he would find nothing similar in nature to compare them to,\r\nhe would again and again repeat the experiment, before he would give it his\r\nentire credence; till by these repetitions it would cease to be a single\r\nfact, and would therefore gain the evidence of analogy. But the latter, as\r\nhaving less knowledge of nature, and less facility of voluntary exertion,\r\nwould more readily believe the assertions of others, or a single fact, as\r\npresented to his own observation. Of this kind are the bulk of mankind;\r\nthey continue throughout their lives in a state of childhood, and have thus\r\nbeen the dupes of priests and politicians in all countries and in all ages\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nIn regard to religious matters, there is an intellectual cowardice\r\ninstilled into the minds of the people from their infancy; which prevents\r\ntheir inquiry: credulity is made an indispensable virtue; to inquire or\r\nexert their reason in religious matters is denounced as sinful; and in the\r\ncatholic church is punished with more severe penances than moral crimes.\r\nBut in respect to our belief of the supposed medical facts, which are\r\npublished by variety of authors; many of whom are ignorant, and therefore\r\ncredulous; the golden rule of David Hume may be applied with great\r\nadvantage. \"When two miraculous assertions oppose each other, believe the\r\nless miraculous.\" Thus if a person is said to have received the small-pox a\r\nsecond time, and to have gone through all the stages of it, one may thus\r\nreason: twenty thousand people have been exposed to the variolous contagion\r\na second time without receiving the variolous fever, to every one who has\r\nbeen said to have thus received it; it appears therefore less miraculous,\r\nthat the assertor of this supposed fact has been deceived, or wishes to\r\ndeceive, than that it has so happened contrary to the long experienced\r\norder of nature.\r\n\r\nM. M. The method of cure is to increase our knowledge of the laws of\r\nnature, and our habit of comparing whatever ideas are presented to us with\r\nthose known laws, and thus to counteract the fallacies of our senses, to\r\nemancipate ourselves from the false impressions which we have imbibed in\r\nour infancy, and to set the faculty of reason above that of imagination.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Orders and Genera of the Fourth Class of Diseases._\r\n\r\nCLASS IV.\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF ASSOCIATION.\r\n\r\nORDO I.\r\n\r\n_Increased Associate Motions._\r\n\r\nGENERA.\r\n\r\n  1.

Motion._\r\n\r\nThe importance of the subsequent class not only consists in its elucidating\r\nall the sympathetic diseases, but in its opening _a road to the knowledge\r\nof fever_. The difficulty and novelty of the subject must plead in excuse\r\nfor the present imperfect state of it. The reader is entreated previously\r\nto attend to the following circumstances for the greater facility of\r\ninvestigating their intricate connections; which I shall enumerate under\r\nthe following heads.\r\n\r\n  A.

Associations affected by other sensorial motions.\r\n  E. Associations catenated with sensation.\r\n  F. Direct and reverse sympathy.\r\n  G. Associations affected four ways.\r\n  H. Origin of associations.\r\n  I. Of the action of vomiting.\r\n  K. Tertian associations.\r\n\r\nA. _Associate Motions distinguished from Catenations._\r\n\r\nAssociate motions properly mean only those, which are caused by the\r\nsensorial power of association. Whence it appears, that those fibrous\r\nmotions, which constitute the introductory link of an associate train of\r\nmotions, are excluded from this definition, as not being themselves caused\r\nby the sensorial power of association, but by irritation, or sensation, or\r\nvolition. I shall give for example the flushing of the face after dinner;\r\nthe capillary vessels of the face increase their actions in consequence of\r\ntheir catenation, not their association, with those of the stomach; which\r\nlatter are caused to act with greater energy by the irritation excited by\r\nthe stimulus of food. These capillaries of the face are associated with\r\neach other reciprocally, as being all of them excited by the sensorial\r\npower of association; but they are only catenated with those of the\r\nstomach, which are not in this case associate motions but irritative ones.\r\nThe common use of the word association for almost every kind of connection\r\nhas rendered this subject difficult; from which inaccuracy I fear some\r\nparts of this work are not exempt.\r\n\r\nB. _Associate Motions of three Kinds._\r\n\r\nThose trains or tribes of associate motions, whose introductory link\r\nconsists of an irritative motion, are termed irritative associations; as\r\nwhen the muscles of the eyelids close the eye in common nictitation. Those,\r\nwhose introductory link consists of a sensitive motion, are termed\r\nsensitive associations; as when the pectoral and intercostal muscles act in\r\nsneezing. And lastly, those, whose introductory link consists of a\r\nvoluntary motion, are termed voluntary associations; as when the muscles of\r\nthe lower limbs act in concert with those of the arm in fencing.\r\n\r\nC. _Associations affected by external Influences._\r\n\r\nCircles of associate motions, as well as trains and tribes of them, are\r\nliable to be affected by external influences, which consist of etherial\r\nfluids, and which, by penetrating the system, act upon it perhaps rather as\r\na causa sine quâ non of its movements, than directly as a stimulus; except\r\nwhen they are accumulated in unusual quantity. We have a sense adapted to\r\nthe perception of the excess or defect of one of these fluids; I mean that\r\nof elementary heat; in which all things are immersed. See Class IV. 1. 4.\r\n7. But there are others of them, which as we have no power to evade their\r\ninfluence, so we have no sense to perceive it; these are the solar, and\r\nlunar, and terrestrial gravitation, in which also all things are immersed;\r\nthe electric aura, which pervades us, and is perpetually varying, See Class\r\nIV. 1. 4. 5; the magnetic fluid, Class IV. 1. 4. 5; and lastly, the great\r\nlife-preserver oxygen gas, and the aqueous vapour of the atmosphere, see\r\nClass IV. 1. 4. 6. and 7. and 2.\r\n\r\nOf these external influences those of heat, and of gravity, have diurnal\r\nperiods of increase and decrease; besides their greater periods of monthly\r\nor annual variation. The manner in which they act by periodical increments\r\non the system, till some effect is produced, is spoken of in Sect. XXXII.\r\n3. and 6.\r\n\r\nD. _Associations affected by other Sensorial Motions._\r\n\r\nCircles and trains of associate motions are also liable to be affected by\r\ntheir catenations with other sensorial powers, as of irritation, or\r\nsensation, or volition; which other sensorial powers either thus simply\r\nform some of the links of the catenation, or add to the energy of the\r\nassociated motions. Thus when vomiting is caused by the stimulus of a stone\r\nin the ureter, the sensation of pain seems to be a link of the catenation\r\nrather than an efficient cause of the vomiting. But when the capillary\r\nvessels of the skin increase their action from the influence of external\r\nheat, they are excited both by the stimulus of unusual heat, as well as by\r\nthe stimulus of the blood, and by their accustomed association with the\r\nactions of the heart and arteries. And lastly, in the blush of anger the\r\nsensorial power of volition is added to that of association, and\r\nirritation, to excite the capillaries of the face with increased action.\r\nSee Class IV. 2. 3. 5.\r\n\r\nE. _Associations catenated with Sensation._\r\n\r\nPain frequently accompanies associate trains or circles of motion without\r\nits being a cause, or a link, of them, but simply an attendant symptom;\r\nthough it frequently gives name to the disease, as head-ach. Thus in the\r\ncramp of the calves of the legs in diarrhoea, the increased sensorial power\r\nof association is the proximate cause; the preceding increased action of\r\nthe bowels is the remote cause; and the proximate effect is the violent\r\ncontractions of the musculi gastrocnemii; but the pain of these muscles is\r\nonly an attendant symptom, or a remote effect. See Sect. XVIII. 15. Other\r\nsensitive associations are mentioned in Class IV. 1. 2. and IV. 1. 2. 15.\r\n\r\nThus, if the flushing of the face above mentioned after dinner be called a\r\ndisease, the immediate or proximate cause is the increased power of\r\nassociation, the remote cause is the increased irritative motions of the\r\nstomach in consequence of the stimulus of food and wine. The disease or\r\nproximate effect consists in the increased actions of the cutaneous vessels\r\nof the face; and the sensation of heat, the existence of heat, and the red\r\ncolour, are attendants or symptoms, or remote effects, of the increased\r\nactions of these cutaneous vessels.\r\n\r\nF. _Direct and reverse Sympathy._\r\n\r\nThe increased actions of the primary part of the trains of associated\r\nmotions are sometimes succeeded by increased actions of the secondary part\r\nof the train; and sometimes by decreased actions of it. So likewise the\r\ndecreased actions of the primary part of a train of associate motions are\r\nsometimes succeeded by decreased actions of the secondary part, and\r\nsometimes by increased actions of it. The former of these situations is\r\ncalled direct sympathy, and the latter reverse sympathy. In general I\r\nbelieve, where the primary part of the train of associated motions is\r\nexerted more than natural, it produces direct sympathy in strong people,\r\nand reverse sympathy in weak ones, as a full meal makes some people hot,\r\nand others chill. And where the primary part of the train is exerted less\r\nthan natural, it produces direct sympathy in weak people, and reverse\r\nsympathy in strong ones, as on being exposed for a certain length of time\r\non horseback in a cold day gives indigestion and consequent heart-burn to\r\nweak people, and strengthens the digestion, and induces consequent hunger\r\nin strong ones. See Sect. XXXV. 1.\r\n\r\nThis may perhaps be more easily understood, by considering strength and\r\nweakness, when applied to animal bodies, as consisting in the quantity of\r\nsensorial power residing in the contracting fibres, and the quantity of\r\nstimulus applied, as shewn in Sect. XII. 2. 1. Now when defective stimulus,\r\nwithin certain limits, is partially applied to parts subject to perpetual\r\nmotion, the expenditure of sensorial power is for a while lessened, but not\r\nits general production in the brain, nor its derivation into the\r\nweakly-stimulated part. Hence in strong people, or such whose fibres abound\r\nwith sensorial power, if the first tribe of an associate train of motions\r\nbe deprived in part of its accustomed stimulus, its action becomes\r\ndiminished; and the sensorial power becomes accumulated, and by its\r\nsuperabundance, or overflowing as it were, increases the action of the\r\nsecond tribe of the associate actions by reverse sympathy. As exposing the\r\nwarm skin for a moderate time to cold air increases the action of the\r\nstomach, and thus strengthens the power of digestion.\r\n\r\nOn the reverse, when additional stimulus within certain limits is partially\r\napplied to parts, which are deficient in respect to the natural quantity of\r\nsensorial power, the expenditure of sensorial power is increased, but in a\r\nless degree than the increased production of it in the brain, or its\r\nincreased derivation into the strongly-stimulated organ. Hence in weak\r\npeople, or such whose fibres are deficient of sensorial power, if the first\r\ntribe of an associate train of motions be subjected for a while to greater\r\nstimulus than usual, a greater production of sensorial power, or a greater\r\nderivation of it into the stimulated parts occurs; which by its excess, or\r\noverflowing as it were, increases the actions of the second tribe of the\r\nassociate motions by direct sympathy. Thus when vomiting occurs with cold\r\nextremities, a blister on the back in a few hours occasions universal\r\nwarmth of the skin, and stops the vomiting. And when a diarrhoea occurs\r\nwith pale skin and cold extremities, the pricking of the points of a\r\nflannel shirt, worn next the skin, occasions universal warmth of it, and\r\nchecks or cures the diarrhoea.\r\n\r\nIn some associate trains of action nevertheless reverse sympathies more\r\nfrequently occur than direct ones, and in others direct ones more\r\nfrequently than reverse ones. Thus in continued fever with debility there\r\nappears to be a reverse sympathy between the capillary vessels of the\r\nstomach and those of the skin; because there exists a total aversion to\r\nsolid food, and constant heat on the surface of the body. Yet these two\r\nsystems of vessels are at other times actuated by direct sympathy, as when\r\npaleness attends sickness, or cold feet induces indigestion. This subject\r\nrequires to be further investigated, as it probably depends not only on the\r\npresent or previous plus or minus of the sensorial power of association,\r\nbut also on the introduction of other kinds of sensorial power, as in Class\r\nIV. 1. 1. D; or the increased production of it in the brain, or the greater\r\nmobility of one part of a train of actions than another.\r\n\r\nThus when much food or wine is taken into the stomach, if there be no\r\nsuperfluity of sensorial power in the system, that is, none to be spared\r\nfrom the continual actions of it, a paleness and chillness succeeds for a\r\ntime; because now the expenditure of it by the increased actions of the\r\nstomach is greater than the present production of it. In a little time\r\nhowever the stimulus of the food and wine increases the production of\r\nsensorial power in the brain, and this produces a superfluity of it in the\r\nsystem; in consequence of which the skin now becomes warm and florid, which\r\nwas at first cold and pale; and thus the reverse sympathy is shortly\r\nconverted into a direct one; which is probably owing to the introduction of\r\na second sensorial power, that of pleasurable sensation.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, when an emetic drug produces sickness, the skin is at\r\nfirst pale for a time by direct sympathy with the capillaries of the\r\nstomach; but in a few minutes, by the accumulation of sensorial power in\r\nthe stomach during its less active state in sickness, the capillaries of\r\nthe skin, which are associated with those of the stomach, act with greater\r\nenergy by reverse sympathy, and a florid colour returns. Where the quantity\r\nof action is diminished in the first part of a train of motions, whether by\r\nprevious diminution of sensorial power, or present diminution of stimulus,\r\nthe second part of the train becomes torpid by direct sympathy. And when\r\nthe quantity of action of the first part becomes increased by the\r\naccumulation of sensorial power during its previous torpor, or by increase\r\nof stimulus, the actions of the second part of it likewise become increased\r\nby direct sympathy.\r\n\r\nIn moderate hunger the skin is pale, as before dinner, and in moderate\r\nsickness, as no great accumulation of sensorial power has commenced; but in\r\nviolent hunger, and in greater torpor of the stomach, as from contagious\r\nmatter, the accumulation of sensorial power becomes so great as to affect\r\nthe arterial and capillary system, and fever is produced in both cases.\r\n\r\nIn contagious fevers with arterial debilities commencing with torpor of the\r\nstomach, why is the action of the heart weakened, and that of the\r\ncapillaries increased? Is it because the mobility of the heart is less than\r\nthat of the stomach, and the mobility of the capillaries greater? Or is it\r\nbecause the association between the muscular fibres of the stomach and\r\nthose of the heart have been uniformly associated by direct sympathy; and\r\nthe capillaries of the stomach and those of the skin have been more\r\nfrequently associated by reverse sympathy?\r\n\r\nWhere the actions of the stomach have been previously exhausted by long\r\nstimulus, as on the day after intoxication, little or no accumulation of\r\nsensorial power occurs, during the torpor of the organ, beyond what is\r\nrequired to replace the deficiency of it, and hence fever seldom follows\r\nintoxication. And a repetition of the stimulus sometimes becomes necessary\r\neven to induce its natural action, as in dram-drinkers.\r\n\r\nWhere there has been no previous exhaustion of sensorial power, and the\r\nprimary link of associate motions is violently actuated by the sensorial\r\npower of sensation, the secondary link is also violently actuated by direct\r\nsympathy, as in inflammatory fevers. Where however the sensorial power of\r\nthe system is less than natural, the secondary link of associated motions\r\nbecomes torpid by reverse sympathy, as in the inoculated small-pox during\r\nthe eruption on the face the feet are frequently cold.\r\n\r\nG. _Associations affected four Ways._\r\n\r\nHence associated trains or circles of motions may be affected four\r\ndifferent ways. 1. By the greater or less energy of action of the first\r\nlink with which they are catenated, and from which they take their names;\r\nas irritative, sensitive, or voluntary associations. 2. By being excited by\r\ntwo or more sensorial powers at the same time, as by irritation and\r\nassociation, as in the instance of the application of the stimulus of\r\nincreased external heat to the cutaneous capillaries. 3. By catenation with\r\nother sensorial powers, as with pain or pleasure, which are in this case\r\nnot the proximate cause of motion, but which, by becoming a link of\r\ncatenation, excites the sensorial power of association into action; as the\r\npain at the neck of the gall-bladder occasioned by a gall-stone is\r\ntransferred to the other end of that canal, and becomes a link of\r\ncatenation between the action of the two extremities of it. 4. The\r\ninfluence of ethereal fluids, as of heat and gravitation. To which last\r\nperhaps might be added moisture and oxygen gas as constituting necessary\r\nparts of the system, rather than stimuli to excite it into action.\r\n\r\nH. _The Origin of Associations._\r\n\r\nSome trains or circles of associate motions must have been formed before\r\nour nativity, as those of the heart, arteries, and capillaries; others have\r\nbeen associated, as occasion required them, as the muscles of the diaphragm\r\nand abdomen in vomiting; and others by perpetual habit, as those of the\r\nstomach with the heart and arteries directly, as in weak pulse during\r\nsickness; with the capillaries directly, as in the flushed skin after\r\ndinner; and lastly, with the cellular absorbents reversely, as in the\r\nincreased absorption in anasarca during sickness; and with the irritative\r\nmotions of the organs of sense reversely, as in vertigo, or sea-sickness.\r\nSome of these associations shall be here shortly described to facilitate\r\nthe investigation of others.\r\n\r\nFirst, other congeries of glands occupy but a particular part of the\r\nsystem, or constitute a particular organ, as the liver, or kidneys; but\r\nthose glands, which secrete the mucus, and perspirable matter, which are\r\ncalled capillaries, are of very great extent; they receive the blood from\r\nthe arteries, separate from it the mucus, which lines every cell, and\r\ncovers every cavity of body; and the perspirable matter, which softens and\r\nlubricates the whole surface of the skin, and the more extensive surface of\r\nthe air-vessels, which compose the lungs. These are supplied with blood by\r\nthe perpetual action of the heart and arteries, and have therefore their\r\nmotions associated with the former, and with each other, by sympathy, which\r\nis sometimes direct, and sometimes reverse.\r\n\r\nOne branch of this association, the capillaries of the skin, are very\r\nirritable by the increased quantities of cold and heat, another branch,\r\nthat of the lungs, has not the perception of cold and heat, but is liable\r\nby direct sympathy to act in concert with the former, as in going into the\r\ncold bath. And it is probable the capillaries of the internal membranes are\r\nlikewise directly affected by their sympathy with those of the skin, as\r\nappears from the defect of secretion in ulcers during the cold fits of\r\nagues.\r\n\r\nThe motions of this extensive system of capillaries, thus associated by\r\ndirect sympathy, are also associated with those of the heart and arteries,\r\nsometimes by reverse and sometimes by direct sympathy; and thus constitute\r\nsimple fever. The cold paroxysm of which consists in their torpor, and the\r\nhot one in their orgasm, or increased activity.\r\n\r\nI. _Of the Action of Vomiting._\r\n\r\nThe manner, in which the stomach and the diaphragm and abdominal muscles\r\nacquire their associate action in vomiting, requires some attention. It is\r\nnot probable, that this action of vomiting occurs before nativity; as the\r\nuniform application of the nutritive liquor amnii to the mouth of the\r\nfoetus, and the uniform expenditure of its nourishment, would not seem to\r\ngive occasion to too great temporary repletion of the stomach; and would\r\npreclude the deglutition of any improper material. After nativity the\r\nstomach of the child may be occasionally too much distended with milk; as\r\nprevious hunger may induce it to overgorge itself; and by repeated efforts\r\nthe act of vomiting is learned, as a means of getting free from a\r\ndisagreeable sensation. Thus when any disgustful material, as a bitter\r\ndrug, is taken into the mouth; certain retrograde motions of the tongue and\r\nlips are produced, for the purpose of putting the disagreeable material out\r\nof the mouth again.\r\n\r\nWhen the stomach is disagreeably stimulated by the distention or acrimony\r\nof the aliment, a similar effort to regurgitate it must occur; and by\r\nrepeated trials the action of the diaphragm and abdominal muscles by\r\nsqueezing the stomach assists its retrograde exertion to disgorge its\r\ncontents. In the same manner when a piece of gravel is pushed into the\r\nurethra, or a piece of indurated bile into the neck of the gall-bladder,\r\nafter they have been in vain pressed forward by the usual motions of those\r\nducts, they return into the bladders of gall and urine by the retrograde\r\nmotions of them.\r\n\r\nThat this is one mode, in which vomiting is induced, appears from the\r\ninstantaneous rejection from the stomach occasioned by some nauseous drug,\r\nor from some nauseous idea; and lastly, from the voluntary power, which\r\nsome people have been said to have acquired, of emptying their stomachs,\r\nmuch in the same manner as ruminating animals bring up the grass from their\r\nfirst stomach.\r\n\r\nThere are nevertheless many modes by which these inverted motions of the\r\nstomach and oesophagus are induced, and which it is of consequence to\r\ndistinguish from each other. The first is the mode above described, where\r\nan effort is made to dislodge something, which stimulates the stomach into\r\ndisagreeable sensation; and which is returned by repeated exertions; as\r\nwhen a nauseous drug is taken into the mouth, or a bit of sand falls into\r\nthe eye, or a drop of water into the wind-pipe. In this the peristaltic\r\nmotions of the stomach are first stopped, and then reverted by painful\r\nsensation; and the abdominal muscles and diaphragm by repeated efforts\r\nbecome associated with them. Now as less sensorial power is expended on the\r\nretrograde actions of the stomach, and of the lymphatics, which open their\r\nmouths on its surface, than by their natural motions, an accumulation of\r\nsensorial power in the fibres of the stomach follows the exhibition of an\r\nemetic, and on that account an emetic will sometimes stop a spontaneous\r\nvomiting which was owing to sensorial deficiency. See Sect. XXXV. 1. 3. and\r\nArt. V. 2. 1.\r\n\r\nAs bitters and metallic salts, exhibited in small doses, stimulate the\r\nstomach into greater action, as appears by their increasing the power of\r\ndigestion, and yet become emetic, when given in larger doses; one might\r\nsuspect, that they became emetic by inducing debility, and consequent\r\nretrograde actions of the stomach, by their previously exhausting the\r\nsensorial power by their great stimulus; which might be effected in a\r\nmoment without producing pain, and in consequence without our perceiving\r\nit. But on the contrary, there does not in general appear on the exhibition\r\nof emetics to be any previous exhaustion of sensorial power; because there\r\nis evidently an accumulation of it during the sickness, as appears from the\r\ndigestion being stronger afterwards; and from the increased action of the\r\ncellular and cutaneous absorbents during its operation. See Art. V. 2. 1.\r\n\r\nAnother mode, by which vomiting is induced, is owing to debility or\r\ndeficiency of sensorial power, from the previous exhaustion of it; as on\r\nthe day after intoxication, or which occurs in people enfeebled with the\r\ngout, and in dropsy, and in some fevers with debility. In these, when the\r\nvomiting ceases, there is no appearance of accumulation of sensorial power,\r\nas the digestion still remains weak and imperfect.\r\n\r\nAnother mode by which sickness or vomiting is induced, is by defect of\r\nstimulus, as in great hunger; and in those, who have been habituated to\r\nspice and spirit with their meals, who are liable to be sick after taking\r\nfood without these additional stimuli. Other means of inducing sickness by\r\nvertigo, or by nauseous ideas, will be mentioned below.\r\n\r\nWe shall only add, that the motions of the muscular fibres of the stomach\r\nare associated with those of the heart and arteries by direct sympathy, as\r\nappears by the weakness of the pulse during the exhibition of an emetic;\r\nand that the absorbents of the stomach are associated with the cellular and\r\ncutaneous absorbents by reverse sympathy, as is shewn by the great\r\nabsorption of the mucus of the cells in anasarca during sickness; at the\r\nsame time that the absorbents of the stomach invert their actions, and pour\r\nthe mucus and water thus absorbed into that viscus.\r\n\r\nIn cold paroxysms of fever the stomach partakes of the general torpor, and\r\nvomiting is induced by its debility, either by its association with the\r\ntorpid capillaries, or other torpid parts, or by its own torpor commencing\r\nfirst, and causing the cold fit. The disordered motions of the stomach\r\nfrequently seem to be the cause or primary seat of fever, as where\r\ncontagious miasmata are swallowed with the saliva, and where fever is\r\nproduced by sea-sickness, which I once saw. Nevertheless a disorder of the\r\nstomach does not always induce fever, as in that case it should constantly\r\nattend indigestion, and vertigo, and sea-sickness; but is itself frequently\r\ninduced by association with the disordered movements of other parts of the\r\nsystem, as when it arises from gravel in the ureter, or from a percussion\r\non the head.\r\n\r\nThe connexion of the motions of the stomach with irritative ideas, or\r\nmotions of the organs of sense, in vertigo, is shewn in Sect. XX. and thus\r\nit appears, that many circles of association are either directly or\r\nreversely associated, or catenated, with this viscus; which will much\r\ncontribute to unfold some of the symptoms of fever.\r\n\r\nK. _Tertian Associations._\r\n\r\nThe third link of associate trains of motion is sometimes actuated by\r\nreverse sympathy, with the second link, and that by reverse sympathy with\r\nthe first link; so that the first and third link may act by direct\r\nsympathy, and the intermediate one by reverse sympathy. Of this instances\r\nare given in the syngultus nephriticus, Class IV. 1. 1. 7. and IV. 2. 1. At\r\nother times the tertian or quartan links of associate motions are actuated\r\nby direct sympathy; and that sometimes forwards and sometimes backwards in\r\nrespect to the usual order of those trains of associate motions, as in\r\nClass IV. 1. 2. 1.\r\n\r\nSPECIES.\r\n\r\n1. _Rubor vultûs prandorum._ Flushing of the face after dinner is explained\r\nin Sect. XXXV. 1. In the beginning of intoxication the whole skin becomes\r\nflorid from the association of the actions of the cutaneous arteries with\r\nthose of the stomach, because vinous spirit excites the fibres of the\r\nstomach into more violent action than the stimulus of common food; and the\r\ncutaneous capillaries of the face, from their more frequent exposure to the\r\nvicissitudes of cold and heat, possess more mobility or irritability than\r\nthose of other parts of the skin, as further explained in Sect. XXXIII. 2.\r\n10. Vinegar is liable to produce this flushing of the face, which probably\r\nis owing to the quantity of vinous spirit it contains, as I believe the\r\nunfermented vegetable acids do not produce this effect. In every kind of\r\nblush the arterial blood is propelled into the capillaries faster than the\r\nvenous absorption can carry it forwards into the veins, in this respect\r\nresembling the tensio phalli.\r\n\r\nCan the beginning vinous or acetous fermentation of the aliment in weak\r\nstomachs contribute to this effect? or is it to be ascribed to the greater\r\npower of association between the arteries of the face and the fibres of the\r\nstomach in some people than in others?\r\n\r\nM. M. Eat and drink less at a time, and more frequently. Put 20 drops of\r\nweak acid of vitriol into water to be drank at meals. Let the dress over\r\nthe stomach and bowels be loose. Use no fermented liquors, or vinegar, or\r\nspice.\r\n\r\n2. _Sudor stragulis immersorum._ Sweat from being covered in bed. In the\r\ncommencement of an epidemic fever, in which the perpetual efforts to vomit\r\nwas a distressing symptom, Dr. Sydenham discovered, that if the patient's\r\nhead was for a short time covered over with the bed clothes, warmth was\r\nproduced, and a sweat broke out upon the skin, and the tendency to vomit\r\nceased. In this curious fact two trains of associated motions are excited\r\ninto increased action. First, the vessels of the lungs are known to have\r\ntheir motion associated with those of the skin by the difficulty of\r\nbreathing on going into the cold bath, as described in Sect. XXXII. 3. 2.\r\nHence, when the vessels of the lungs become excited into stronger action,\r\nby the bad air under the bed clothes, warmed and adulterated by frequent\r\nbreathing, those of the external skin soon become excited by their\r\nassociation into more energetic action, and generate more heat along with a\r\ngreater secretion of perspirable matter. Secondly, the sympathy between the\r\nstomach and skin is evident in variety of circumstances; thus the cold air\r\nof frosty days applied to the skin for a short time increases the action of\r\nthe stomach by reverse sympathy, but decreases it if continued too long by\r\ndirect sympathy; so in the circumstance above mentioned the action of the\r\nstomach is increased by direct sympathy with that of the skin; and the\r\ntendency to vomit, which was owing to its diminished action, ceases.\r\n\r\n3. _Cessatio ægritudinis cute excitatâ._ The cure of sickness by\r\nstimulating the skin. This is explained in the preceding article; and\r\nfurther noticed in IV. 2. 2. 4. and in IV. 1. 1. f.\r\n\r\nSimilar to these is the effect of a blister on the back in relieving\r\nsickness, indigestion, and heart-burn; and, on the contrary, by these\r\nsymptoms being frequently induced by coldness of the extremities. The\r\nblister stimulates the cutaneous vessels into greater action; whence warmth\r\nand pain are produced at the same time, and the fibres of the stomach are\r\nexcited into greater action by their association with those of the skin. It\r\ndoes not appear, that the concomitant pain of the blister causes the\r\nincreased energy of the stomach, because the motions of it are not greater\r\nthan natural; though it is sometimes difficult to determine, whether the\r\nprimary part of some associated trains be connected with irritative or\r\nsensitive motions.\r\n\r\nIn the same manner a flannel shirt, to one who has not been in the habit of\r\nwearing one, stimulates the skin by its points, and thus stops vomiting in\r\nsome cases; and is particularly efficacious in checking some chronical\r\ndiarrhoeas, which are not attended with fever; for the absorbents of the\r\nskin are thus stimulated into greater action, with which those of the\r\nintestines consent by direct sympathy.\r\n\r\nThis effect cannot be ascribed to the warmth alone of the flannel shirt, as\r\nbeing a covering of loose texture, and confining air in its pores, like a\r\nsponge, which air is known to be a bad conductor of heat, since in that\r\ncase its use should be equally efficacious, if it were worn over a linen\r\nshirt; and an increased warmth of the room of the patient would be equally\r\nserviceable.\r\n\r\n4. _Digestio aucta frigore cutaneo._ Digestion increased by coldness of the\r\nskin. Every one has experienced the increase of his appetite after walking\r\nin the cool air in frosty days; for there is at this time not only a saving\r\nof sensorial power by the less exertion of the cutaneous vessels; but, as\r\nthese consent with those of the stomach and bowels, this saving of\r\nsensorial power is transferred by reverse sympathy from the cutaneous\r\ncapillaries and absorbents to those of the stomach and intestines.\r\n\r\nHence weak people should use the cold air of winter as a cold bath; that\r\nis, they should stay in it but a short time at once, but should immerse\r\nthemselves in it many times a day.\r\n\r\n5. _Catarrhus a frigore cutaneo._ Catarrh from cold skin. This has been\r\nalready explained in Class I. 1. 2. 7. and is further described in Sect.\r\nXXXV. 1. 3. In this disease the vessels of the membrane, which lines the\r\nnostrils, are excited into greater action; when those of the skin, with\r\nwhich they are associated, are excited into less action by the deficiency\r\nof external heat, by reverse sympathy; and though the pain of cold attends\r\nthe torpor of the primary link of this association, yet the increased\r\nmotions of the membrane of the nostrils are associated with those of the\r\ncutaneous vessels, and not with the pain of them, because no inflammation\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\n6. _Absorptio cellularis aucta vomitu._ In the act of vomiting the\r\nirritative motions of the stomach are inverted, and of the absorbents,\r\nwhich open their mouths into it; while the cutaneous, cellular, and\r\npulmonary absorbents are induced, by reverse sympathy with them, to act\r\nwith greater energy. This is seen in cases of anasarca, when long sickness\r\nand vomiting are caused by squills, or antimonial salts, or most of all by\r\nthe decoction of digitalis purpurea, foxglove; and Mr. J. Hunter mentions a\r\ncase, in which a large bubo, which was just ready to break, was absorbed in\r\na few days by sickness at sea. Treatise on the Blood, p. 501, which is thus\r\naccounted for; less sensorial power is expended during sickness by the\r\ndecreased action of the fibres of the stomach, and of its absorbents; as\r\nshewn in Sect. XXXV. 1. 3. whence an accumulation of it is produced, and\r\nthere is in consequence a greater quantity of sensorial power for the\r\nexertion of those motions, which are associated with the absorbents of the\r\nstomach by reverse sympathy.\r\n\r\nThe reverse sympathy between the lacteal and lymphatic branches of the\r\nabsorbent system have been produced by the one branch being less excited to\r\nact, when the other supplies sufficient fluid or nutriment to the\r\nsanguiferous vessels. Thus when the stomach is full, and the supply of\r\nchyle and mucus and water is in sufficient quantity; the pulmonary,\r\ncellular, and cutaneous lymphatics are not excited into action; whence the\r\nurine is pale, and the skin moist, from the defect of absorption on those\r\nsurfaces.\r\n\r\n7. _Syngultus nephriticus._ When a stone irritates the ureter, and that\r\neven without its being attended with pain or fever, sometimes a chronical\r\nhiccough occurs, and continues for days and weeks, instead of sickness or\r\nvomiting; which are the common symptoms. In this case the motions of the\r\nstomach are decreased by their sympathy with those of the ureter, which are\r\nincreased by the stimulus of the stone in it; and the increased motions of\r\nthe diaphragm seem to exist in consequence of their association with the\r\nstomach by a second reverse sympathy. This hiccough may nevertheless admit\r\nof another explanation, and be supposed to be a convulsive exertion of the\r\ndiaphragm to relieve the disagreeable sensation of the stomach in\r\nconsequence of its disordered irritative associations; and in that case it\r\nwould belong to Class III. 1. 1. See Class IV. 2. 1. for another example of\r\ntertiary association.\r\n\r\nM. M. Venesection. Emetic. Calomel. Cathartic, opium, oil of cinnamon from\r\ntwo to ten drops. Aerated alcaline water. Peruvian bark.\r\n\r\n8. _Febris irritativa._ Irritative fever, described in Class I. 1. 1. 1.\r\nThe diseases above explained in this genus are chiefly concerning the\r\nsympathies of the absorbent system, or the alimentary canal, which are not\r\nso much associated with the arterial system, as to throw it into disorder,\r\nwhen they are slightly deranged; but when any great congeries of\r\nconglomerate glands, which may be considered as the extremities of the\r\narterial system, are affected with torpor, the whole arterial system and\r\nthe heart sympathize with the torpid glands, and act with less energy;\r\nwhich constitutes the cold fit of fever; which is therefore at first a\r\ndecreased action of the associate organ; but as this decrease of action is\r\nonly a temporary effect, and an increase of exertion both of the torpid\r\nglands, and of the whole arterial system, soon follows; the hot fit of\r\nirritative fever, or fever with strong pulse, properly belongs to this\r\nclass and genus of diseases.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nORDO I.\r\n\r\n_Increased Associate Motions._\r\n\r\nGENUS II.\r\n\r\n_Catenated with Sensitive Motions._\r\n\r\nThe primary links of the associated actions of this genus are either\r\nproduced or attended by painful or pleasurable sensation. The secondary\r\nlinks of the first ten species are attended with increased motions without\r\ninflammation, those of the remainder are attended with inflammation. All\r\ninflammations, which do not arise in the part which was previously torpid,\r\nbelong to this genus; as the gout, rheumatism, erysipelas. It is probable\r\nmany other inflammations may, by future observation, require to be\r\ntransplanted into this class.\r\n\r\nThe circles of sensitive associate motions consist chiefly of the excretory\r\nducts of the capillaries and of the mouths of the absorbent vessels, which\r\nconstitute the membranes; and which have been induced into action at the\r\nsame time; or they consist of the terminations of canals; or of parts which\r\nare endued with greater sensibility than those which form the first link of\r\nthe association. An instance of the first of those is the sympathy between\r\nthe membranes of the alveolar processes of the jaws, and the membranes\r\nabove or beneath the muscles about the temples in hemicrania. An instance\r\nof the second is in the sympathy between the excretory duct of the lacrymal\r\ngland, and the nasal duct of the lacrymal sack. And an instance of the\r\nthird is the sympathy between the membranes of the liver, and the skin of\r\nthe face in the gutta rosea of inebriates.\r\n\r\nSPECIES.\r\n\r\n1. _Lacrymarum fluxus sympatheticus._ A flow of tears from grief or joy.\r\nWhen the termination of the duct of the lacrymal sac in the nostrils\r\nbecomes affected either by painful or pleasurable sensations, in\r\nconsequence of external stimulus, or by its association with agreeable or\r\ndisagreeable ideas, the motions of the lacrymal gland are at the same time\r\nexerted with greater energy, and a profusion of tears succeeds by sensitive\r\nassociation, as explained in Sect. XVI. 8. 2.\r\n\r\nIn this case there exists a chain of associated actions, the secretion of\r\nthe lacrymal gland is increased by whatever stimulates the surface of the\r\neye, at the same time the increased abundance of tears stimulates the\r\npuncta lacrymalia into greater action; and the fluid thus absorbed\r\nstimulates the lacrymal sac, and its nasal duct in the nose into greater\r\naction. In a contrary direction of this chain of association the present\r\nincrease of action is induced. First, the nasal duct of the lacrymal sac is\r\nexcited into increased action by some pleasurable or painful idea, as\r\ndescribed in Sect. XVI. 8. 2.   2d. The puncta lacrymalia or other\r\nextremity of the lacrymal sac sympathizes with it (as the two ends of all\r\nother canals sympathize with each other).   3d. With these increased\r\nmotions of the puncta lacrymalia those of the excretory duct of the\r\nlacrymal gland are associated from their having so perpetually acted\r\ntogether. And, lastly, with the increased actions of the excretory duct of\r\nthis gland are associated those of the other end of it by their frequently\r\nacting together; in the same manner as the extremities of other canals are\r\nassociated; and thus a greater flow of tears is poured into the eye.\r\n\r\nWhen a flow of tears is produced in grief, it is believed to relieve the\r\nviolence of it, which is worthy a further inquiry. Painful sensations, when\r\ngreat, excite the faculty of volition; and the person continues voluntarily\r\nto call up or perform those ideas, which occasion the painful sensation;\r\nthat is, the afflicted person becomes so far insane or melancholy; but\r\ntears are produced by the sensorial faculty of association, and shew that\r\nthe pain is so far relieved as not to excite the excessive power of\r\nvolition, or insanity, and are therefore a sign of the abatement of the\r\npainful state of grief, rather than a cause of that abatement. See Class\r\nIII. 1. 2. 10.\r\n\r\n2. _Sternutatio a lumine._ Some persons sneeze from looking up at the light\r\nsky in a morning after coming out of a dark bedroom. The olfactory nerves\r\nare brought into too great action by their sympathy with the optic nerves,\r\nor by their respective sympathies with some intervening parts, as probably\r\nwith the two extremities of the lacrymal sac; that is, with the puncta\r\nlacrymalia and the nasal duct. See Class II. 1. 1. 3.\r\n\r\n3. _Dolor dentium Stridore._ Tooth-edge from grating sounds, and from the\r\ntouch of certain substances, and even from imagination alone, is described\r\nand explained in Sect. XVI. 10. The increased actions of the alveolar\r\nvessels or membranes are associated with the ideas, or sensual motions of\r\nthe auditory nerves in the first case; and of those of the sense of touch,\r\nin the second case; and by imagination, or ideas exerted of painful\r\nsensation alone, in the last.\r\n\r\n4. _Risus sardonicus._ A disagreeable smile attends inflammations of the\r\ndiaphragm arising from the associations of the reiterated exertions of that\r\nmuscle with those of the lips and cheeks in laughing. See Diaphragmitis,\r\nClass II. 1. 2. 6.\r\n\r\n5. _Salivæ fluxus cibo viso._ The flow of saliva into the mouths of hungry\r\nanimals at the sight or smell of food is seen in dogs standing round a\r\ndinner-table. The increased actions of the salivary glands have been\r\nusually produced by the stimulus of agreeable food on their excretory ducts\r\nduring the mastication of it; and with this increased action of their\r\nexcretory ducts the other terminations of those glands in the capillary\r\narteries have been excited into increased action by the mutual association\r\nof the ends of canals; and at the same time the pleasurable ideas, or\r\nsensual motions, of the sense of smell and of sight have accompanied this\r\nincreased secretion of saliva. Hence this chain of motions becomes\r\nassociated with those visual or olfactory ideas, or with the pleasure,\r\nwhich produces or attends them.\r\n\r\n6. _Tensio mamularum viso puerulo._ The nipples of lactescent women are\r\nliable to become turgid at the sight of their young offspring. The nipple\r\nhas generally been rendered turgid by the titillation of the lips or gums\r\nof the child in giving suck; the visible idea of the child has thus\r\nfrequently accompanied this pleasurable sensation of parting with the milk,\r\nand turgescence of the tubes, which constitute the nipple. Hence the visual\r\nidea of the child, and the pleasure which attends it, become associated\r\nwith those increased arterial actions, which swell the cells of the mamula,\r\nand extend its tubes; which is very similar to the tensio phalli visâ\r\nmuliere nudâ etiam in insomnio.\r\n\r\n7. _Tensio penis in hydrophobia._ An erection of the penis occurs in the\r\nhydrophobia, and is a troublesome symptom, as observed by Coelius\r\nAurelianus, Fothergill, and Vaughn, and would seem to be produced by an\r\nunexplained sympathy between the sensations about the fauces and the penis.\r\nIn men the hair grows about both these parts, the voice changes, and the\r\nneck thickens at puberty. In the mumps, when the swellings about the throat\r\nsubsides, the testicles are liable to swell. Venereal infection received by\r\nthe penis is very liable to affect the throat with ulcers. Violent coughs,\r\nwith soreness or rawness about the fauces are often attended with erection\r\nof the penis; which is also said to happen to male animals, that are\r\nhanged; which last circumstance has generally been ascribed to the\r\nobstruction of the circulation of the blood, but is more probably\r\noccasioned by the stimulus of the cord in compressing the throat; since if\r\nit was owing to impeded circulation it ought equally to occur in drowning\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nIn men the throat becomes so thickened at the time of puberty, that a\r\nmeasure of this is used to ascertain the payment of a poll-tax on males in\r\nsome of the islands of the Mediterranean, which commences at puberty; a\r\nstring is wrapped twice round the thinnest part of the neck, the ends of it\r\nare then put into each corner of the mouth; and if, when thus held in the\r\nteeth, it passes readily over the head, the subject is taxable.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to point out by what circumstance the sensitive motions of\r\nthe penis and of the throat and nose become associated; I can only observe,\r\nthat these parts are subjected to greater pleasurable sensations than any\r\nother parts of the body; one being designed to preserve ourselves by the\r\npleasure attending the smell and deglutition of food, and the other to\r\nensure the propagation of our species; and may thus gain an association of\r\ntheir sensitive motion by their being eminently sensible to pleasure. See\r\nClass I. 3. 1. 11. and III. 1. 1. 15. and Sect. XVI. 5.\r\n\r\nIn the female sex this association between the face, throat, nose, and\r\npubis does not exist; whence no hair grows on their chins at the time of\r\npuberty, nor does their voices change, or their necks thicken. This happens\r\nprobably from there being in them a more exquisite sensitive sympathy\r\nbetween the pubis and the breasts. Hence their breasts swell at the time of\r\npuberty, and secrete milk at the time of parturition. And in the parotitis,\r\nor mumps, the breasts of women swell, when the tumor of the parotitis\r\nsubsides. See Class I. 1. 2. 15. Whence it would appear, that their breasts\r\npossess an intermediate sympathy between the pubis and the throat; as they\r\nare the seat of a passion, which men do not possess, that of suckling\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n8. _Tenesmus calculosus._ The sphincter of the rectum becomes painful or\r\ninflamed from the association of its sensitive motions with those of the\r\nsphincter of the bladder, when the latter is stimulated into violent pain\r\nor inflammation by a stone.\r\n\r\n9. _Polypus narium ex ascaridibus?_ The stimulation of ascarides in the\r\nrectum produces by sensitive sympathy an itching of the nose, as explained\r\nin IV. 2. 2. 6; and in three children I have seen a polypus in the nose,\r\nwho were all affected with ascarides; to the perpetual stimulation of\r\nwhich, and the consequent sensitive association, I was led to ascribe the\r\ninflammation and thickening of the membrane of the nostrils.\r\n\r\n10. _Crampus surarum in cholera._ A cramp of the muscles of the legs occurs\r\nin violent diarrhoea, or cholera, and from the use of too much acid diet in\r\ngouty habits. This seems to sympathize with uneasy sensation in the bowels.\r\nSee Class III. 1. 1. 14. This association is not easily accounted for, but\r\nis analogous in some degree to the paralysis of the muscles of the arms in\r\ncolica saturnina. It would seem, that the muscles of the legs in walking\r\nget a sympathy with the lower parts of the intestines, and those of the\r\narms in variety of employment obtain a sympathy with the higher parts of\r\nthem. See Cholera and Ileus.\r\n\r\n11. _Zona ignea nephritica._ Nephritic shingles. The external skin about\r\nthe loins and sides of the belly I suppose to have greater mobility in\r\nrespect to sensitive association, than the external membrane of the kidney;\r\nand that their motions are by some unknown means thus associated. When the\r\ntorpor or beginning inflammation of this membrane ceases, the external skin\r\nbecomes inflamed, in its stead, and a kind of herpes, called the shingles,\r\ncovers the loins and sides of the belly. See Class II. 1. 5. 9.\r\n\r\n12. _Eruptio variolarum._ After the inflammation of the inoculated arm has\r\nspread for a quarter of a lunation, it affects the stomach by reverse\r\nsympathy; that is, the actions of the stomach are associated with those of\r\nthe skin; and as much sensorial power is now exerted on the inflamed skin,\r\nthe other part of this sensitive association is deprived of its natural\r\nshare, and becomes torpid, or inverts its motions. After this torpor of the\r\nstomach has continued a time, and much sensorial power is thus accumulated;\r\nother parts of the skin, which are also associated with it, as that of the\r\nface first, are thrown into partial inflammation; that is, the eruptions of\r\nthe small-pox appear on the face.\r\n\r\nFor that the variolous matter affects the stomach previous to its eruption\r\non the skin appears from the sickness at the commencement of the fever; and\r\nbecause, when the morbid motions affect the skin, those of the stomach\r\ncease; as in the gout and erysipelas, mentioned below. The consent between\r\nthe stomach and the skin appears in variety of other diseases; and as they\r\nboth consist of surfaces, which absorb and secrete a quantity of moisture,\r\ntheir motions must frequently be produced together or in succession; which\r\nis the foundation of all the sympathies of animal motions, whether of the\r\nirritative, sensitive, or voluntary kinds.\r\n\r\nNow as the skin, which covers the face, is exposed to greater variations of\r\nheat and cold than any other part of the body; it probably possesses more\r\nmobility to sensitive associations, not only than the stomach, but than any\r\nother part of the skin; and is thence affected at the eruption of the\r\nsmall-pox with violent action and consequent inflammation, by the\r\nassociation of its motions with those of the stomach, a day before the\r\nother parts of the skin; and becomes fuller of pustules, than any other\r\npart of the body. See Class II. 1. 3. 9.\r\n\r\nIt might be supposed, that the successive swelling of the hands, when the\r\nface subsides, at the height of the small-pox, and of the feet, when the\r\nhands subside, were governed by some unknown associations of those parts of\r\nthe system; but these successions of tumor and subsidence more evidently\r\ndepend on the times of the eruption of the pustules on those parts, as they\r\nappear a day sooner on the face than on the hands, and a day sooner on the\r\nhands than on the feet, owing to the greater comparative mobility of those\r\nparts of the skin.\r\n\r\n13. _Gutta rosea stomatica._ Stomatic red face. On drinking cold water, or\r\ncold milk, when heated with exercise, or on eating cold vegetables, as raw\r\nturnips, many people in harvest-time have been afflicted with what has been\r\ncalled a surfeit. The stomach becomes painful, with indigestion and\r\nflatulency, and after a few days an eruption of the face appears, and\r\ncontinues with some relief, but not with entire relief; as both the pimpled\r\nface and indigestion are liable to continue even to old age.\r\n\r\nM. M. Venesection. A cathartic with calomel. Then half a grain of opium\r\ntwice a day for many weeks. If saturated solution of arsenic three or five\r\ndrops twice or thrice a day for a week?\r\n\r\n14. _Gutta rosea hepatica._ The rosy drop of the face of some drinking\r\npeople is produced like the gout described below, in consequence of an\r\ninflamed liver. In these constitutions the skin of the face being exposed\r\nto greater variation of heat and cold than the membranes of the liver,\r\npossesses more mobility than those hepatic membranes; and hence by whatever\r\nmeans these membranes are induced to sympathize, when this sensitive\r\nassociation occurs, the cutaneous vessels of the face run into greater\r\ndegrees of those motions, which constitute inflammation, than previously\r\nexisted in the membranes of the liver; and then those motions of the liver\r\ncease. See Class II. 1. 4. 6.\r\n\r\nAn inflammation of the liver so frequently attends the great potation of\r\nvinous spirit, there is reason to suspect, that this viscus itself becomes\r\ninflamed by sensitive association with the stomach; or that, when one\r\ntermination of the bile-duct, which enters the duodenum is stimulated\r\nviolently, the other end may become inflamed by sensitive association.\r\n\r\n15. _Podagra._ The gout, except when it affects the liver or stomach, seems\r\nalways to be a secondary disease, and, like the rheumatism and erysipelas\r\nmentioned below, begins with the torpor of some distant part of the system.\r\n\r\nThe most frequent primary seat of the gout I suppose to be the liver, which\r\nis probably affected with torpor not only previous to the annual paroxysms\r\nof the gout, but to every change of its situation from one limb to another.\r\nThe reasons, which induce me to suspect the liver to be first affected, are\r\nnot only because the jaundice sometimes attends the commencement of gout,\r\nas described in Sect. XXIV. 2. 8. but a pain also over the pit of the\r\nstomach, which I suppose to be of the termination of the bile-duct in the\r\nduodenum, and which is erroneously supposed to be the gout of the stomach,\r\nwith indigestion and flatulency, generally attends the commencement of the\r\ninflammation of each limb. See Arthritis ventriculi, Class I. 2. 4. 6. In\r\nthe two cases, which I saw, of the gout in the limbs being preceded by\r\njaundice, there was a cold shivering fit attended the inflammation of the\r\nfoot, and a pain at the pit of the stomach; which ceased along with the\r\njaundice, as soon as the foot became inflamed. This led me to suspect, that\r\nthere was a torpor of the liver, and perhaps of the foot also, but\r\nnevertheless the liver might also in this case be previously inflamed, as\r\nobserved in Sect. XXIV. 2. 8.\r\n\r\nNow as the membranes of the joints of the feet suffer greater variations of\r\nheat and cold than the membranes of the liver, and are more habituated to\r\nextension and contraction than other parts of the skin in their vicinity; I\r\nsuppose them to be more mobile, that is, more liable to run into extremes\r\nof exertion or quiescence; and are thence more susceptible of inflammation,\r\nthan such parts as are less exposed to great variations of heat and cold,\r\nor of extension and contraction.\r\n\r\nWhen a stone presses into the sphincter of the bladder, the glans penis is\r\naffected with greater pain by sympathy, owing to its greater sensibility,\r\nthan the sphincter of the bladder; and when this pain commences, that of\r\nthe sphincter ceases, when the stone is not too large, or pushed too far\r\ninto the urethra. Thus when the membrane, which covers the ball of the\r\ngreat toe, sympathizes with some membranous part of a torpid or inflamed\r\nliver; this membrane of the toe falls into that kind of action, whether of\r\ntorpor or inflammation, with greater energy, than those actions excited in\r\nthe diseased liver; and when this new torpor or inflammation commences,\r\nthat with which it sympathises ceases; which I believe to be a general law\r\nof associated inflammations.\r\n\r\nThe paroxysms of the gout would seem to be catenated with solar influence,\r\nboth in respect to their larger annual periods, and to their diurnal\r\nperiods--See Sect. XXXVI. 3. 6.--as the former occur about the same season\r\nof the year, and the latter commence about an hour before sun-rise;\r\nnevertheless the annual periods may depend on the succession of great\r\nvicissitudes of cold and heat, and the diurnal ones on our increased\r\nsensibility to internal sensations during sleep, as in the fits of asthma,\r\nand of some epilepsies. See Sect. XVIII. 15.\r\n\r\nIn respect to the pre-remote cause or disposition to the gout, there can be\r\nno doubt of its individually arising from the potation of fermented or\r\nspirituous liquors in this country; whether opium produces the same effect\r\nin the countries, where it is in daily use, I have never been well\r\ninformed. See Sect. XXI. 10, where this subject is treated of; to which I\r\nhave to add, that I have seen some, and heard of others, who have moderated\r\ntheir paroxysms of gout, by diminishing the quantity of fermented liquors,\r\nwhich they had been accustomed to; and others who, by a total abstinence\r\nfrom fermented liquors, have entirely freed themselves from this\r\nexcruciating malady; which otherwise grows with our years, and curtails or\r\nrenders miserable the latter half, or third, of the lives of those, who are\r\nsubject to it. The remote cause is whatever induces temporary torpor or\r\nweakness of the system; and the proximate cause is the inirritability, or\r\ndefective irritation, of some part of the system; whence torpor and\r\nconsequent inflammation. The great Sydenham saw the beneficial effects of\r\nthe abstinence from fermented liquors in preventing the gout, and adds, \"if\r\nan empiric could give small-beer only to gouty patients as a nostrum, and\r\npersuade them not to drink any other spirituous fluids, that he might\r\nrescue thousands from this disease, and acquire a fortune for his\r\ningenuity.\" Yet it is to be lamented, that this accurate observer of\r\ndiseases had not resolution to practise his own prescription, and thus to\r\nhave set an example to the world of the truth of his doctrine; but, on the\r\ncontrary, recommends Madeira, the strongest wine in common use, to be taken\r\nin the fits of the gout, to the detriment of thousands; and is said himself\r\nto have perished a martyr to the disease, which he knew how to subdue!\r\n\r\nAs example has more forcible effect: than simple assertion, I shall now\r\nconcisely relate my own case, and that of one of my most respected friends.\r\nE. D. was about forty years of age, when he was first seized with a fit of\r\nthe gout. The ball of his right great toe was very painful, and much\r\nswelled and inflamed, which continued five or six days in spite of\r\nvenesection, a brisk cathartic with ten grains of calomel, and the\r\napplication of cold air and cold water to his foot. He then ceased to drink\r\nale or wine alone; confining himself to small beer, or wine diluted with\r\nabout thrice its quantity of water. In about a year he suffered two other\r\nfits of the gout, in less violent degree. He then totally abstained from\r\nall fermented liquors, not even tasting small-beer, or a drop of any kind\r\nof wine; but eat plentifully of flesh-meat, and all kinds of vegetables,\r\nand fruit, using for his drink at meals chiefly water alone, or lemonade,\r\nor cream and water; with tea and coffee between them as usual.\r\n\r\nBy this abstinence from fermented liquors he kept quite free from the gout\r\nfor fifteen or sixteen years; and then began to take small-beer mixed with\r\nwater occasionally, or wine and water, or perry and water, or cyder and\r\nwater; by which indulgence after a few months he had again a paroxysm of\r\ngout, which continued about three days in the ball of his toe; which\r\noccasioned him to return to his habit of drinking water, and has now for\r\nabove twenty years kept in perpetual health, except accidental colds from\r\nthe changes of the seasons. Before he abstained from fermented or\r\nspirituous liquors, he was frequently subject to the piles, and to the\r\ngravel, neither of which he has since experienced.\r\n\r\nIn the following case the gout was established by longer habit and greater\r\nviolence, and therefore required more cautious treatment. The Rev. R. W.\r\nwas seized with the gout about the age of thirty-two, which increased so\r\nrapidly that at the age of forty-one he was confined to his room seven\r\nmonths in that year; he had some degree of lameness during the intervals,\r\nwith chalky swellings of his heels and elbows. As the disease had continued\r\nso long and so violently, and the powers of his digestion were somewhat\r\nweakened, he was advised not entirely to leave off all fermented liquors;\r\nand as small-beer is of such various strength, he was advised to drink\r\nexactly two wine glasses, about four ounces, of wine mixed with three or\r\nfour times its quantity of water, with or without lemon and sugar, for his\r\ndaily potation at dinner, and no other fermented liquor of any kind; and\r\nwas advised to eat flesh-meat with any kind of boiled vegetables, and\r\nfruit, with or without spice. He has now scrupulously continued this\r\nregimen for above five years, and has had an annual moderate gouty paroxysm\r\nof a few weeks, instead of the confinement of so many months, with great\r\nhealth and good spirits during the intervals.\r\n\r\nThe following is a more particular account of the history of this case;\r\nbeing part of a letter which Mr. Wilmot wrote on that subject at my\r\nentreaty.\r\n\r\n    \"I entered into the army with an excellent constitution at the age of\r\n    fifteen. The corps I served in was distinguished by its regularity,\r\n    that is, the regular allowance of the mess was only one pint of wine\r\n    per man each day; unless we had company to dine with us; then, as was\r\n    the general custom of the time, the bottle circulated without limit.\r\n    This mode of living, though by no means considered as excess for men,\r\n    was certainly too great for a youth of my age. This style of living I\r\n    continued, when with the regiment, till the latter end of the year\r\n    1769, when I had the misfortune to sleep in a damp bed at Sheffield on\r\n    a journey to York, but arrived there before I felt the ill effects of\r\n    it. I was then seized with a violent inflammatory rheumatism with great\r\n    inflammation of my eyes, and was attended by Dr. Dealtry; so violent\r\n    was the disorder, that I was bled for it eight times in less than a\r\n    fortnight; and was three months, before I could consider my health\r\n    perfectly re-established. Dr. Dealtry told me, that I should be subject\r\n    to similar attacks for many years; and that he had no doubt, from the\r\n    tendency he found in my habit to inflammation, that, when I was farther\r\n    advanced in life, I should change that complaint for the gout. He\r\n    predicted truly; for the three succeeding winters I had the same\r\n    complaint, but not so violently; the fourth winter I escaped, and\r\n    imputed my escape to the continuance of cold bathing during the whole\r\n    of that winter; after that I never escaped it, till I had a regular and\r\n    severe fit of the gout: after the first attack of rheumatic fever I was\r\n    more abstemious in my manner of living, though when in company I never\r\n    subjected myself to any great restraint. In the year 1774 I had quitted\r\n    the army, and being in a more retired situation, was seldom led into\r\n    any excess; in 1776 and 1777 I was in the habit of drinking a good deal\r\n    of wine very frequently, though not constantly. After that period till\r\n    the year 1781, I drank a larger quantity of wine regularly, but very\r\n    seldom to any degree of intoxication. I lived much at that time in the\r\n    society of some gentlemen, who usually drank nearly a bottle of wine\r\n    daily after dinner. I must here however observe, that at no part of my\r\n    life was I accustomed to drink wine in an evening, and very seldom\r\n    drank any thing more than a single half-pint glass of some sort of\r\n    spirits diluted with much water. Till the year 1781 I had always been\r\n    accustomed to use very violent and continued exercise on horseback; in\r\n    the winter months I pursued all field diversions, and in the summer\r\n    months I rode frequent and long journeys; and with this exercise was\r\n    liable to perspire to great excess; besides which I was subject to very\r\n    profuse night-sweats, and had frequently boils break out all over me,\r\n    especially in the spring and autumn; for which I took no medicine,\r\n    except a little flour of sulphur with cream of tartar in honey.\r\n\r\n    \"You will observe I bring every thing down to the date of 1781. In the\r\n    month of October in that year, when I was just entered into the\r\n    thirty-second year of my age, I had the first attack of gout; that fit\r\n    was very severe, and of many weeks continuance. I now determined upon a\r\n    more abstemious method of living, in respect to wine; and indeed the\r\n    society, in which I had before been accustomed to live, being\r\n    considerably changed, I had less frequent temptations to excess. From\r\n    this time I enjoyed the most perfect good state of health till August\r\n    1784, when I had my second attack of gout. I never perfectly recovered\r\n    from this attack through the succeeding winter, and in March 1785 was\r\n    advised to try the Bath waters, and drank them under the direction of\r\n    one of the faculty of that place. I was there soon seized with a fever,\r\n    and a slight attack of gout in one knee. I should observe, that when I\r\n    set out from home, I was in a weak and low state, and unequal to much\r\n    fatigue; as appeared by my having a fainting fit one day on the road,\r\n    after having travelled only about fifty miles; in the course of the\r\n    summer I had two or three more slight attacks of gout of less\r\n    consequence, till the month of October; when I was afflicted with it\r\n    all over me in such a manner, as to be without the possibility of the\r\n    least degree of removal for some days; and was about two months without\r\n    being able to get into the air. This was the severest attack I had then\r\n    experienced; though I have since had several equally severe. In the\r\n    course of this summer I had a fall with my horse; and soon after it,\r\n    having discovered an enlargement on one elbow, I concluded I had hurt\r\n    it at that time; but in the course of this last attack having a similar\r\n    enlargement on the other elbow, I found my mistake, and that they were\r\n    collections of gouty matter; these increased to the size of pullet's\r\n    eggs, and continue in that state. I had soon after similar enlargements\r\n    on my heels; the right heel being severely bruised, I was under the\r\n    necessity of having it lanced, and a large quantity of chalky matter\r\n    was discharged from it; and have since that time frequently had chalky\r\n    matter taken from it, and sometimes small bits of apparently perfect\r\n    chalk. My right hand soon was afflicted in the same way, and I have\r\n    scarcely a joint on those fingers now in a natural state. My left hand\r\n    has escaped tolerably well. After this last attack (viz. October 1785),\r\n    I had two or three slight attacks before the month of June 1787, when I\r\n    had a very severe intermittent fever; from that time I continued very\r\n    well till the latter end of the year, when I began to feel the gout\r\n    about me very much, but was not confined by it. I was in this state\r\n    advised to try what is called the American Recipe (gum guaiacum and\r\n    nitre dissolved in spirits); it had apparently been of essential\r\n    service to a friend of mine, who from the inability to walk a mile for\r\n    some years, was believed to be restored by the use of this medicine to\r\n    a good state of health, so as to walk ten miles a day. In addition to\r\n    this medicine I drank, as my common beverage with my meals, spruce\r\n    beer. I had so high an opinion of this medicine in the gout, and of\r\n    spruce beer as an antiscorbutic, that I contemplated with much\r\n    satisfaction, and with very little doubt, the perfect restoration of my\r\n    health and strength; but I was miserably deceived; for in September\r\n    1788 I was seized with the gout in a degree that none but arthritics,\r\n    and indeed but few of those, can easily conceive. From this time till\r\n    August 1789 I scarcely ever passed a comfortable day; seven months of\r\n    this time I had been confined, my health seemed much impaired, my\r\n    strength was diminished, and my appetite almost gone. In this state my\r\n    friends pressed me to consult you. I was unwilling for some time to do\r\n    it, as I had lost all hope of relief; however, when I had determined to\r\n    apply to you, I likewise determined to give up every prejudice of my\r\n    own respecting my case, and to adhere most strictly to your advice. On\r\n    the 20th of August 1789 I consulted you, on the 25th I entered upon the\r\n    regimen, which you prescribed, and which was as follows.\r\n\r\n    \"Drink no malt liquor on any account. Let your beverage at dinner\r\n    consist of two glasses of wine diluted with three half-pints of water.\r\n    On no account drink any more wine or spirituous liquors in the course\r\n    of the day; but, if you want more liquid, take cream and water, or milk\r\n    and water, or lemonade, with tea, coffee, chocolate. Use the warm bath\r\n    twice a week for half an hour before going to bed, at the degree of\r\n    heat which is most grateful to your sensations. Eat meat constantly at\r\n    dinner, and with it any kind of tender vegetables you please. Keep the\r\n    body open by two evacuations daily, if possible without medicine, if\r\n    not take the size of a nutmeg of lenitive electuary occasionally, or\r\n    five grains of rhubarb every night. Use no violent exercise, which may\r\n    subject yourself to sudden changes from heat to cold; but as much\r\n    moderate exercise as may be, without being much fatigued or starved\r\n    with cold. Take some supper every night; a small quantity of animal\r\n    food is preferred; but if your palate refuses this, take vegetable\r\n    food, as fruit pie, or milk; something should be eaten, as it might be\r\n    injurious to you to fast too long.\" To the whole of this I adhered most\r\n    scrupulously, and soon found my appetite improve, and with it my\r\n    strength and spirits. I had in December a fevere attack, and two or\r\n    three slight ones in the course of twelve months; but the improvement\r\n    in the general state of my health induced me to persevere. On the 18th\r\n    of August 1790 I had another severe attack, but it went off easier than\r\n    before, and I soon recovered sufficiently to go to Buxton, which you\r\n    advised me to, and from which I reaped great benefit; nevertheless on\r\n    the 29th of December I had a slight attack in comparison of some that I\r\n    had before experienced, and from that time I was free from gout, and\r\n    enjoyed my health perfectly well till the fourth week in October 1791;\r\n    from that till the third week in October 1792; from that till the third\r\n    week in October 1793; and from that till June 1794. From what happened\r\n    for the last three years I dreaded the month of October; but I escaped\r\n    then, and have enjoyed my health most perfectly ever since till within\r\n    the last week, that I have had a slight attack in one knee, which is\r\n    nearly gone, without any symptom to lead me to suppose that it will go\r\n    further.\r\n\r\n    \"I adhered to your advice most scrupulously for the first year; and in\r\n    regard to the not drinking malt liquor, and taking only the two glasses\r\n    of wine with water, I have never deviated but two days; and then the\r\n    first day I only drank one glass of ale and one glass of Champaigne; on\r\n    the second only one glass of Champaigne. With regard to the warm bath,\r\n    I only use it now when I have gouty symptoms upon me, and in such\r\n    situations I find it of infinite service; and in other respects I\r\n    continue to live according to your direction.\r\n\r\n    \"Many persons have laughed at the idea of my perseverance in a system,\r\n    which has not been able to _cure_ the gout after five years trial; but\r\n    such persons are either ignorant of what I before suffered, or totally\r\n    unacquainted with the nature of the disorder. Under the blessing of\r\n    Providence, by an adherence to your advice, I am reaping all the\r\n    benefit you flattered me I might expect from it, viz. my attacks less\r\n    frequent, my sufferings less acute, and an improvement in the general\r\n    state of my health.\r\n\r\n    \"I have been particular in this account of myself at your request, and\r\n    am, Sir, &c.\r\n\r\n      MORLEY, near DERBY,\r\n      February 10th, 1795.\r\n      ROBERT WILMOT.\"\r\n\r\nThere are situations nevertheless in which a paroxysm of gout has been\r\nbelieved to be desirable, as relieving the patient from other disagreeable\r\ndiseases, or debilities, or sensations. Thus when the liver is torpid, a\r\nperpetual uneasiness and depression of spirits occur; which a fit of gout\r\nis supposed to cure by a metastasis of the disease. Others have acquired\r\nepileptic fits, probably from the disagreeable sensation of a chronically\r\ninflamed liver; which they suppose the pain and inflammation of gout would\r\nrelieve. When gouty patients become much debilitated by the progress of the\r\ndisease, they are liable to dropsy of the chest, which they suppose a fit\r\nof the gout would relieve. But in all these cases the attempt to procure a\r\nparoxysm of gout by wine, or aromatics, or volatiles, or blisters, or\r\nmineral waters, seldom succeeds; and the patients are obliged to apply to\r\nother methods of relief adapted to their particular cases. In the two\r\nformer situations small repeated doses of calomel, or mercurial unction on\r\nthe region of the liver may succeed, by giving new activity to the vessels\r\nof the liver, either to secrete or to absorb their adapted fluids, and thus\r\nto remove the cause of the gout, rather than to promote a fit of it. In the\r\nlast case the tincture of digitalis, and afterwards the class of sorbentia,\r\nmust be applied to.\r\n\r\nM. M. In young strong patients the gout should be cured by venesection and\r\ncathartics and diluents, with poultices externally. But it has a natural\r\ncrisis by producing calcareous matter on the inflamed membrane, and\r\ntherefore in old enfeebled people it is safest to wait for this crisis,\r\nattending to the natural evacuations and the degree of fever; and in young\r\nones, where it is not attended with much fever, it is customary and popular\r\nnot to bleed, but only to keep the body open with aloes, to use gentle\r\nsudorifics, as neutral salts, and to give the bark at the decline of the\r\nfit; which is particularly useful where the patient is much debilitated.\r\nSee Arthritis ventriculi, Class I. 2. 4. 6. and Sect. XXV. 17.\r\n\r\nWhen there is not much fever, and the patient is debilitated with age, or\r\nthe continuance of the disease, a moderate opiate, as twenty drops of\r\ntincture of opium, or one grain of solid opium, may be taken every night\r\nwith advantage. Externally a paste made with double the quantity of yeast\r\nis a good poultice; and booterkins made with oiled silk, as they confine\r\nthe perspirable matter, keep the part moist and supple, and thence relieve\r\nthe pain like poultices.\r\n\r\nThe only safe way of moderating the disease is by an uniform and equal\r\ndiminution, or a total abstinence from fermented liquors, with the cautions\r\ndirected in Sect. XII. 7. 8. The continued use of strong bitters, as of\r\nPortland's powder, or bark, has been frequently injurious, as spoken of in\r\nthe Materia Medica, Art. IV. 2. 11.\r\n\r\nOne of my acquaintance, who was much afflicted with the gout, abstained for\r\nabout half a year from beer and wine; and not having resolution to persist,\r\nreturned to his former habits of potation in less quantity; and observed\r\nthat he was then for one winter stronger and freer from the gout than\r\nusual. This however did not long continue, as the disease afterwards\r\nreturned with its usual or increased violence. This I think is a\r\ncircumstance not unlikely to occur, as opium has a greater effect after its\r\nuse has been a while intermitted; and the debility or torpor, which is the\r\ncause of gout, is thus for a few months prevented by the greater\r\nirritability of the system, acquired during the lessened use of fermented\r\nliquor.\r\n\r\nFor the same reason an ounce of spirituous tincture of guaiacum, or of\r\nbark, is said to have for some time prevented returns of the gout; which\r\nhas afterwards, like all other great stimuli when long continued, been\r\nsucceeded by greater debility, and destroyed the patient. This seems to\r\nhave been exemplified in the case of the ingenious Dr. Bown, see Preface to\r\nhis Elementa Medicinæ; he found temporary relief from the stimulus of wine,\r\nregardless of its future effects.\r\n\r\n16. _Rheumatismus._ Acute rheumatism. There is reason to suspect, that\r\nrheumatic inflammations, like the gouty ones, are not a primary disease;\r\nbut that they are the consequence of a translation of morbid action from\r\none part of the system to another. This idea is countenanced by the\r\nfrequent change of place of rheumatic-like gouty inflammations, and from\r\ntheir attacking two similar parts at the same time, as both ankles and both\r\nwrists, and these attacks being in succession to each other. Whereas it is\r\nnot probable that both feet or both hands should at the same time be\r\nequally exposed to any external cause of the disease, as to cold or\r\nmoisture; and less so that these should occur in succession. Lastly, from\r\nthe inflammatory diathesis in this disease being more difficult to subdue,\r\nand more dangerous in event, than other common inflammations, especially to\r\npregnant women, and in weak constitutions.\r\n\r\nFrom this idea of the rheumatism being not a primary disease, like the\r\ngout, but a transferred morbid action owing to the previous torpor of some\r\nother part of the system, we perceive why it attacks weak people with\r\ngreater pertinacity than strong ones; resisting or recurring again and\r\nagain after frequent evacuations, in a manner very different from primary\r\ninflammations; because the cause is not removed, which is at a distance\r\nfrom the seat of the inflammation.\r\n\r\nThis also accounts for rheumatic inflammations so very rarely terminating\r\nin suppuration, because like the gout the original cause is not in the\r\ninflamed part, and therefore does not continue to act after the\r\ninflammation commences. Instead of suppuration in this disease, as well as\r\nin the gout, a quantity of mucus or coagulable lymph is formed on the\r\ninflamed membrane; which in the gout changes into chalkstones, and in the\r\nrheumatism is either reabsorbed, or lies on the membrane, producing pains\r\non motion long after the termination of the inflammation, which pains are\r\ncalled chronic rheumatism. The membranes, which have thus been once or\r\nrepeatedly inflamed, become less mobile, or less liable to be affected by\r\nsympathy, as appears by the gout affecting new parts, when the joints of\r\nthe foot have been frequently inflamed by it; hence as the cause of the\r\ninflammation does not exist in the inflamed part, and as this part becomes\r\nless liable to future attacks, it seldom suppurates.\r\n\r\nSecondly, when rheumatism affects the muscles of the chest, it produces\r\nsymptoms similar to pleurisy, but are distinguished from that by the\r\npatient having previously suffered rheumatic affections in other parts, and\r\nby the pertinacity or continuance of the inflammatory state of the patient,\r\nthis should be termed pleurodyne rheumatica.\r\n\r\nThirdly, when rheumatic inflammation affects the bowels, it produces a\r\ndisease very different from enteritis, or common inflammation of the\r\nbowels, and should be termed enteralgia rheumatica. The pain is less than\r\nin enteritis, and the disease of longer continuance, with harder pulse, and\r\nthe blood equally sizy. It is attended with frequent dejections, with much\r\nmucus, and previous griping pains, but without vomiting; and differs\r\nperhaps from dysentery from its not being attended with bloody stools, and\r\nnot being infectious.\r\n\r\nFourthly, there is another kind of rheumatism attended with debility, which\r\nsuppurates, and should be termed rheumatismus suppurans. It is generally\r\nbelieved to be the gout, till suppuration takes place on the swelled joint;\r\nand, as the patient sinks, there are sloughs formed over the whole mouth;\r\nand he seems to be destroyed by inflammation or gangrene of the mucous\r\nmembranes. I have twice seen this disease in patients about sixty. Some\r\nother diseases are erroneously called rheumatic, as hemicrania, and\r\nodontalgia. See Sect. XXVI. 3.\r\n\r\nM.M. In the three former kinds venesection repeatedly. Cathartics.\r\nAntimonials. Diluents. Neutral salts. Oil. Warm bath. Afterwards the bark.\r\nOpium with or without ipecacuanha; but not till the patient is considerably\r\nweakened. Sweats forced early in the disease do injury. Opium given early\r\nin the disease prolongs it. In the last kind, gentle stimulants, as wine\r\nand water, mucilage, sorbentia.\r\n\r\nThe following is a case of suppurative rheumatism. Mr. F----, about sixty,\r\nwas supposed to have the gout in his hand, which however suppurated, and it\r\nwas then called the suppurative rheumatism. He had lived rather\r\nintemperately in respect to wine, and was now afflicted with a tendency to\r\ninflammation of the mucous membranes. As he lay on the bed half resupine,\r\npropped up with pillows, and also slept in that posture, his lower jaw\r\ndropped by its own weight, when the voluntary power of the muscles was\r\nsuspended. The mucus of his mouth and throat became quite dry, and at\r\nlength was succeeded with sloughs; this was a most distressing circumstance\r\nto him, and was in vain endeavoured to be relieved by supporting his jaw by\r\nslender steel springs fixed to his night-cap, and by springs of elastic\r\ngum. The sloughs spread and seemed to accelerate his death. See Class I. 1.\r\n3. 2.\r\n\r\n17. _Erysipelas._ The erysipelas differs from the zona ignea, and other\r\nspecies of herpes, in its being attended with fever, which is sometimes of\r\nthe sensitive irritated or inflammatory kind, with strong and full pulse;\r\nand at other times with weak pulse and great inirritability, as when it\r\nprecedes or attends mortifications. See Class II. 1. 3. 2.\r\n\r\nLike the zona ignea above described, it seems to be a secondary disease,\r\nhaving for its primary part the torpor or inflammation of some internal or\r\ndistant membrane, as appears from its so frequently attending wounds;\r\nsometimes spreading from issues over the whole limb, or back, by sympathy\r\nwith a tendon or membrane, which is stimulated by the pease in them. In its\r\nmore violent degree I suppose that it sympathizes with some extensive\r\ninternal membranes, as of the liver, stomach, or brain. Another reason,\r\nwhich countenances this idea, is, that the inflammation gradually changes\r\nits situation, one part healing as another inflames; as happens in respect\r\nto more distant parts in gout and rheumatism; and which seems to shew, that\r\nthe cause of the disease is not in the same place with the inflammation.\r\nAnd thirdly, because the erysipelas of the face and head is liable to\r\naffect the membranes of the brain; which were probably in these cases the\r\noriginal or primary seat of the disease; and lastly, because the fits of\r\nerysipelas, like those of the gout, are liable to return at certain annual\r\nor monthly periods, as further treated of in Class II. 1. 3. 2.\r\n\r\nMany cases of erysipelas from wounds or bruises are related in Default's\r\nSurgical Journal, Vol. II. in which poultices are said to do great injury,\r\nas well as oily or fatty applications. Saturnine solutions were sometimes\r\nused with advantage. A grain of emetic tartar given to clear the stomach\r\nand bowels, is said to be of great service.\r\n\r\n18. _Testium tumor in gonorrhoea._ Mr. Hunter in his Treatise on the\r\nVenereal Disease observes, that the tumor of the testes in gonorrhoea\r\narises from their sympathy with the inflammation of the urethra; and that\r\nthey are not similar to the actions arising from the application of\r\nvenereal matter, whether by absorption or otherwise; as they seldom or\r\nnever suppurate; and when suppuration happens, the matter produced is not\r\nvenereal.

The\r\nswelling of the testes, when that of the parotis subsides, seems to arise\r\nfrom the association of successive action; as the tension of the penis in\r\nhydrophobia appears to arise from the previous synchronous associations of\r\nthe sensitive motions of these parts; but the manner of the production of\r\nboth these associations is yet very obscure. In women a swelling of the\r\nbreasts often succeeds the decline of the mumps by another wonderful\r\nsympathy. See Class IV. 1. 2. 7. and I. 1. 2. 15. In many persons a\r\ndelirium succeeds the swelling of the parotis, or the subsequent ones of\r\nthe testes or breasts; which is sometimes fatal, and seems to arise from a\r\nsympathy of successive action, and not of synchronous action, of the\r\nmembranes of the brain with those of the parotide glands. Sometimes a\r\nstupor comes on instead of this delirium, which is relieved by fomenting\r\nthe shaved head for an hour or two. See Class II. 1. 3. 4.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nORDO I.\r\n\r\n_Increased Associate Motions._\r\n\r\nGENUS III.\r\n\r\n_Catenated with Voluntary Motions_\r\n\r\nSPECIES.\r\n\r\n1. _Deglutitio invita._ When any one is told not to swallow his saliva, and\r\nthat especially if his throat be a little sore, he finds a necessity of\r\nimmediately swallowing it; and this the more certainly, the more he\r\nvoluntarily endeavours not to do so.\r\n\r\nIn this case the voluntary power exerted by our attention to the pharinx\r\nrenders it more sensible to irritation, and therefore occasions it to be\r\nmore frequently induced to swallow the saliva. Here the irritation induces\r\na volition to swallow it, which is more powerful than the desire not to\r\nswallow it. See XXIV. 1. 7. So in reverie, when the voluntary power was\r\nexerted on any of the senses, as of sight or taste, the objects of those\r\nsenses became perceived; but not otherwise. Sect. XIX. 6. This is a\r\ntroublesome symptom in some sore throats.\r\n\r\nM. M. Mucilage, as sugar and gum arabic. Warm water held in the mouth\r\nfrequently, as a fomentation to the inflamed throat.\r\n\r\n2. _Nictitatio invita._ Involuntary winking with the eye-lids, and\r\ntwitchings of the face, are originally induced by an endeavour to relieve\r\nsome disagreeable sensations about inflamed eyes, as the dazzling of light;\r\nand afterwards these motions become catenated with other motions or\r\nsensations, so as not to be governed by the will. Here the irritation first\r\nproduces a volition to wink, which by habit becomes stronger than the\r\nanti-volition not to wink.\r\n\r\nThis subject is rendered difficult from the common acceptation of the word,\r\nvolition, including previous deliberation, as well as the voluntary\r\nexertion, which succeeds it. In the volitions here spoken of there is no\r\ntime for deliberation or choice of objects, but the voluntary act\r\nimmediately succeeds the sensation which excites it.\r\n\r\nM. M. Cover the affected parts with a sticking plaster or a blister. Pass a\r\nfine needle and thread through a part of the skin over the muscle, which\r\nmoves, and attach the other end of the thread by a sticking plaster to a\r\ndistant part. An issue behind the ear. To practise daily by a looking-glass\r\nto stop the motions with the hand. See the cure of a case of the leaping of\r\na muscle of the arm, Sect. XVII. 1. 8. See Convulsio debilis, Class III. 1.\r\n1. 5.\r\n\r\n3. _Risus invitus._ Involuntary laughter. When the pleasure arising from\r\nnew combinations of words and ideas, as in puns; or of other circumstances,\r\nwhich are so trivial, as to induce no voluntary exertion to compare or\r\nconsider their present importance or their future consequence; the pleasure\r\nis liable to rise into pain; that is, the ideas or sensual motions become\r\nexerted too violently for want of some antithetistic ideas; in the same\r\nmanner as those muscles, which have weak antagonists, as those of the calf\r\nof the leg, are liable to fall into cramp or painful contraction. In this\r\nsituation a scream is begun to relieve this pain of ideas too violently\r\nexerted, which is stopped again soon, as explained in Sect. XXXIV. 1. 4.\r\nand Class III. 1. 1. 4. and IV. 2. 3. 3.\r\n\r\nThe pain, into which this pleasure rises, which would excite the scream of\r\nlaughter, has been felt forcibly by every one; when they have been under\r\nsuch circumstances, as have induced them to restrain it by a\r\ncounter-volition; till at length the increased associate motions produce so\r\nmuch pain as to overcome the counter-volition, and the patient bursts out\r\ninto indecent laughter, contrary to his will in the common acceptation of\r\nthat word.\r\n\r\n4. _Lusus digitorum invitus._ An awkward playing with the fingers in\r\nspeaking in public. These habits are began through bashfulness, and seem\r\nrather at first designed to engage the attention in part, and thus prevent\r\nthe disagreeable ideas of mauvaise hont; as timorous boys whistle, when\r\nthey are obliged to walk in the dark; and as it is sometimes necessary to\r\nemploy raw soldiers in perpetual manoeuvres, as they advance to the first\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\n5. _Unguium morsiuncula invita._ Biting the nails is a depraved habit\r\narising from similar causes as those of the last article.\r\n\r\nM.

Dip the fingers in solution of aloes.\r\n\r\n6. _Vigilia invita._ Watchfulness, where the person wishes, and endeavours\r\nto fall asleep, properly belongs to this place, as the wish or volition to\r\nsleep prevents the desired effect; because sleep consists in an abolition\r\nof volition.

The eggs of fowls were shewn by Mr. J.\r\nHunter to resist the freezing process in their living state more\r\npowerfully, than when they were killed by having the yolk and white shook\r\ntogether. Philos. Trans. It may be asked, does the heat during the\r\nincubation of eggs act as a stimulus exciting the living principle into\r\nactivity? Or does it act simply as a causa sine quâ non, as an influence,\r\nwhich penetrating the mass, removes the particles of it to a greater\r\ndistance from each other, so as to allow their movement over each other, in\r\nthe same manner as heat is conceived to produce the fluidity of water; not\r\nby stimulus, but by its penetrating influence? Or may elementary heat in\r\nits uncombined state be supposed to act only as an influence necessary to\r\nlife in its natural quantity; whence torpor and death follows the eduction\r\nof it from the body; but in its increased state above what is natural, or\r\nusual, that it acts as a stimulus; which we have a sense to perceive; and\r\nwhich excites many parts of the system into unnatural action? See Class IV.\r\n1. 1. C.\r\n\r\n2. _Vita hiemi-dormientium._ The torpor of insects, and birds, and\r\nquadrupeds, during the cold season, has been called sleep; but I suppose it\r\nmust differ very much from that state of animal life, since not only all\r\nvoluntary power is suspended, but sensation and vascular motion has ceased,\r\nand can only be restored by the influence of heat. There have been related\r\ninstances of snails, which have recovered life and motion on being put into\r\nwater after having experienced many years of torpidity, or apparent death,\r\nin the cabinets of the curious. Here the water as well as the heat are\r\nrequired not only as a stimulus, but as a causa sine quâ non of fluidity\r\nand motion, and consequent life.\r\n\r\n3. _Pullulatio arborum._ The annual revivescence of the buds of trees seems\r\nnot only to be owing to the influence of the returning warmth of the\r\nspring, but also to be catenated with solar gravitation; because seeds and\r\nroots and buds, which are analogous to the eggs of animals, put forth their\r\nshoots by a less quantity of heat in spring, than they had undergone in the\r\nlatter part of autumn, which may however be ascribed to their previous\r\ntorpid state, and consequent accumulation of sensorial power, or\r\nirritability; as explained in Botanic Garden, Part II. Cant. I. l. 322.\r\nnote. Other circumstances, which countenance the idea, that vegetation is\r\naffected by solar gravitation, as well as by heat, may be observed in the\r\nripening of the seeds of plants both in those countries where the summers\r\nare short, and in those where they are long. And by some flowers closing\r\ntheir bells at noon, or soon after; and hence seem to sleep rather at solar\r\ndiurnal periods, than from the influence of cold, or the deficiency of\r\nlight.\r\n\r\n4. _Orgasmatis venerei periodus._ The venereal orgasm of birds and\r\nquadrupeds commences or returns about the vernal or autumnal equinoxes, and\r\nthence seems in respect to their great periods to be governed by solar\r\ninfluence. But if this orgasm be disappointed of its object, it is said to\r\nrecur at about monthly periods, as observed in mares and bitches in this\r\nrespect resembling the female catamenia. See Sect. XXXVI. 2. 3. and Sect.\r\nXVI. 13.\r\n\r\n5. _Brachii concussio electrica._ The movement of the arm, even of a\r\nparalytic patient, when an electric shock is passed through it, is owing to\r\nthe stimulus of the excess of electricity. When a piece of zinc and silver,\r\neach about the size of a crown-piece, are placed one under the upper lip,\r\nand the other on the tongue, so as the outer edges may be brought into\r\ncontact, there is an appearance of light in the eyes, as often as the outer\r\nedges of these metals are brought into contact or separated; which is\r\nanother instance of the stimulus of the passage of electric shocks through\r\nthe fibres of the organs of sense, as well as through the muscular fibres.\r\nSee Sect. XII. 1. 1. and first addit. note to Vol. I. of this work. But in\r\nits natural state electricity seems only to act as an influence on animal\r\nand vegetable bodies; of the salutary or injurious effects of which we have\r\nyet no precise knowledge.\r\n\r\nYet if regular journals were kept of the variations of atmospheric\r\nelectricity, it is probable some discoveries of its influence on our system\r\nmight in time be discovered. For this purpose a machine on the principle of\r\nMr. Bennet's electric doubler might be applied to the pendulum of a clock,\r\nso as to manifest, and even to record the daily or hourly variations of\r\naerial electricity. Which has already been executed, and applied to the\r\npendulum of a Dutch wooden clock, by Mr. Bennet, curate of Wirksworth in\r\nDerbyshire.\r\n\r\nBesides the variations of the degree or kind of atmospheric electricity,\r\nsome animals, and some men, seem to possess a greater power of accumulating\r\nthis fluid in themselves than others. Of which a famous history of a\r\nRussian prince was lately published; who, during the clear and severe\r\nfrosts of that country, could not move himself in bed without luminous\r\ncorruscations. Such may have been the case of those people, who have been\r\nrelated to have taken fire spontaneously, and to have been reduced to\r\nashes. The electric concussion from the gymnotus electricus, and torpedo,\r\nare other instances of the power of the animal system to accumulate\r\nelectricity, as in these it is used as a weapon of defence, or for the\r\npurpose of taking their prey.\r\n\r\nSome have believed that the accumulation or passage of the magnetic fluid\r\nmight affect the animal system, and have asserted that the application of a\r\nlarge magnet to an aching tooth has quickly effected a cure. If this\r\nexperiment is again tried in odontalgia, or hemicrania, the painful\r\nmembrane of the tooth or head should be included between the south and\r\nnorth poles of a horse-shoe magnet, or between the contrary poles of two\r\ndifferent magnets, that the magnetism may be accumulated on the torpid\r\npart.\r\n\r\n6. _Oxygenatio sanguinis._ The variation of the quantity of oxygen gas\r\nexisting in the atmosphere must affect all breathing animals; in its excess\r\nthis too must be esteemed a stimulus; but in its natural quantity would\r\nseem to act as an influence, or cause, without which, animal life cannot\r\nexist even a minute. It is hoped that Dr. Beddoes's plan for a pneumatic\r\ninfirmary, for the purpose of putting this and various other airs to the\r\ntest of experiment, will meet with public encouragement, and render\r\nconsumption, asthma, cancer, and many diseases conquerable, which at\r\npresent prey with unremitted devastation on all orders and ages of mankind.\r\n\r\n7. _Humectatio corporis._ Water, and probably the vapour of water dissolved\r\nor diffused in the atmosphere, unites by mechanical attraction with the\r\nunorganized cuticle, and softens and enlarges it; as may be seen in the\r\nloose and wrinkled skin of the hands of washerwomen; the same probably\r\noccurs to the mucous membrane of the lungs in moist weather; and by\r\nthickening it increases the difficulty of respiration of some people, who\r\nare said to be asthmatical. So far water may be said to act as an influx or\r\ninfluence, but when it is taken up by the mouths of the absorbent system,\r\nit must excite those mouths into action, and then acts as a stimulus.\r\n\r\nThere appears from hence to be four methods by which animal bodies are\r\npenetrated by external things. 1. By their stimulus, which induces the\r\nabsorbent vessels to imbibe them. 2. By mechanical attraction, as when\r\nwater softens the cuticle. 3. By chemical attraction, as when oxygen passes\r\nthrough the membranes of the air-vessels of the lungs, and combines with\r\nthe blood. And lastly, by influx without mechanical attraction, chemical\r\ncombination, or animal absorption, as the universal fluids of heat,\r\ngravitation, electricity, magnetism, and perhaps of other ethereal fluids\r\nyet unknown.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nORDO II.\r\n\r\n_Decreased Associate Motions._\r\n\r\nGENUS I.\r\n\r\n_Catenated with Irritative Motions._\r\n\r\nAs irritative muscular motions are attended with pain, when they are\r\nexerted too weakly, as well as when they are exerted too strongly; so\r\nirritative ideas become attended with sensation, when they are exerted too\r\nweakly, as well as when they are exerted too strongly. Which accounts for\r\nthese ideas being attended with sensation in the various kinds of vertigo\r\ndescribed below.\r\n\r\nThere is great difficulty in tracing the immediate cause of the deficiences\r\nof action of some links of the associations of irritative motions; first,\r\nbecause the trains and tribes of motions, which compose these links, are so\r\nwidely extended as to embrace almost the whole animal system; and secondly,\r\nbecause when the first link of an associated train of actions is exerted\r\nwith too great energy, the second link by reverse sympathy may be affected\r\nwith torpor. And then this second link may transmit, as it were, this\r\ntorpor to a third link, and at the same time regain its own energy of\r\naction; and it is possible this third link may in like manner transmit its\r\ntorpor to a fourth, and thus regain its own natural quantity of motion.\r\n\r\nI shall endeavour to explain this by an example taken from sensitive\r\nassociated motions, as the origin of their disturbed actions is more easily\r\ndetected. This morning I saw an elderly person, who had gradually lost all\r\nthe teeth in his upper jaw, and all of the under except three of the\r\nmolares; the last of these was now loose, and occasionally painful; the\r\nfangs of which were almost naked, the gums being much wasted both within\r\nand without the jaw. He is a man of attentive observation, and assured me,\r\nthat he had again and again noticed, that, when a pain commenced in the\r\nmembranes of the alveolar process of the upper jaw opposite to the loose\r\ntooth in the under one (which had frequently occurred for several days\r\npast), the pain of the loose tooth ceased. And that, when the pain\r\nafterwards extended to the ear and temple on that side, the pain in the\r\nmembranes of the upper jaw ceased. In this case the membranes of the\r\nalveolar process of the upper jaw became torpid, and consequently painful,\r\nby their reverse sympathy with the too violent actions of the inflamed\r\nmembranes of the loose tooth; and then by a secondary sympathy the\r\nmembranes about the ear and temple became torpid, and painful; and those of\r\nthe alveolar process of the upper jaw regained their natural quantity of\r\naction, and ceased to be painful. A great many more nice and attentive\r\nobservations are wanted to elucidate these curious circumstances of\r\nassociation, which will be found to be of the greatest importance in the\r\ncure of many diseases, and lead us to the knowledge of fever.\r\n\r\nSPECIES.\r\n\r\n1. _Cutis frigida pransorum._ Chillness after dinner frequently attends\r\nweak people, or those who have been exhausted by exercise; it arises from\r\nthe great expenditure of the sensorial power on the organs of digestion,\r\nwhich are stimulated into violent action by the aliment; and the vessels of\r\nthe skin, which are associated with them, become in some measure torpid by\r\nreverse sympathy; and a consequent chillness succeeds with less absorption\r\nof atmospheric moisture. See the subsequent article.\r\n\r\n2. _Pallor urinæ pransorum._ The paleness of urine after a full meal is an\r\ninstance of reverse association; where the secondary part of a train of\r\nassociate motions acts with less energy in consequence of the greater\r\nexertions of the primary part. After dinner the absorbent vessels of the\r\nstomach and intestines are stimulated into greater action, and drink up the\r\nnewly taken aliment; while those, which are spread in great number on the\r\nneck of the bladder, absorb less of the aqueous part of the urine than\r\nusual, which is therefore discharged in a more dilute state; and has been\r\ntermed crude by some medical writers, but it only indicates, that so great\r\na proportion of the sensorial power is expended on digestion and absorption\r\nof the aliment, that other parts of the system act for a time with less\r\nenergy. See Class IV. I. 1. 6.\r\n\r\n3. _Pallor urinæ a frigore cutaneo._ There is a temporary discharge of pale\r\nwater, and a diarrhoea, induced by exposing the skin to the cold air; as is\r\nexperienced by boys, who strip themselves before bathing. In this case the\r\nmouths of the cutaneous lymphatics become torpid by the subduction of their\r\naccustomed degree of heat, and those of the bladder and intestines become\r\ntorpid by direct sympathy; whence less of the thinner part of the urinary\r\nsecretion, and of the mucus of the intestines, is reabsorbed. See Sect.\r\nXXIX. 4. 6. This effect of suddenly cooling the skin by the aspersion of\r\ncold water has been used with success in costiveness, and has produced\r\nevacuations, when other means have failed. When young infants are afflicted\r\nwith griping joined with costiveness, I have sometimes directed them to be\r\ntaken out of a warm bed, and carried about for a few minutes in a cool\r\nroom, with almost instant relief.\r\n\r\n4. _Pallor ex ægritudine._ When sickness of stomach first occurs, a\r\npaleness of the skin attends it; which is owing to the association or\r\ncatenation between the capillaries of the stomach and the cutaneous ones;\r\nwhich at first act by direct sympathy. But in a short time there commences\r\nan accumulation of the sensorial power of association in the cutaneous\r\ncapillaries during their state of inactivity, and then the skin begins to\r\nglow, and sweats break out, from the increased action of the cutaneous\r\nglands or capillaries, which is now in reverse sympathy with those of the\r\nstomach. So in continued fevers, when the stomach is totally torpid, which\r\nis known by the total aversion to solid food, the cutaneous capillaries are\r\nby reverse sympathy in a perpetual state of increased activity, as appears\r\nfrom the heat of the skin.\r\n\r\n5. _Dyspnoea a balneo frigido._ The difficulty of breathing on going up to\r\nthe middle in cold water is owing to the irritative association or\r\ncatenation of the action of the extreme vessels of the lungs with those of\r\nthe skin. So that when the latter are rendered torpid or inactive by the\r\napplication of sudden cold, the former become inactive at the same time,\r\nand retard the circulation of the blood through the lungs, for this\r\ndifficulty of breathing cannot be owing to the pressure of the water\r\nimpeding the circulation downwards, as it happens equally by a cold\r\nshower-bath, and is soon conquered by habitual immersions. The capillaries\r\nof the skin are rendered torpid by the subduction of the stimulus of heat,\r\nand by the consequent diminution of the sensorial power of irritation. The\r\ncapillaries of the lungs are rendered torpid by the diminution of the\r\nsensorial power of association, which is now excited in less quantity by\r\nthe lessened actions of the capillaries of the skin, with which they are\r\ncatenated. So that at this time both the cutaneous and pulmonary\r\ncapillaries are principally actuated, as far as they have any action, by\r\nthe stimulus of the blood. But in a short time the sensorial powers of\r\nirritation, and of association, become accumulated, and very energetic\r\naction of both these membranes succeed. Which thus resemble the cold and\r\nhot fit of an intermittent fever.\r\n\r\n6. _Dyspepsia a pedibus frigidis._ When the feet are long cold, as in\r\nriding in cold and wet weather, some people are very liable to indigestion\r\nand consequent heart-burn. The irritative motions of the stomach become\r\ntorpid, and do their office of digestion imperfectly, in consequence of\r\ntheir association with the torpid motions of the vessels of the\r\nextremities. Fear, as it produces paleness and torpidity of the skin,\r\nfrequently occasions temporary indigestion in consequence of this\r\nassociation of the vessels of the skin with those of the stomach; as riding\r\nin very bad roads will give flatulency and indigestion to timorous people.\r\n\r\nA short exposure to cold air increases digestion, which is then owing to\r\nthe reverse sympathy between the capillary vessels of the skin, and of the\r\nstomach. Hence when the body is exposed to cold air, within certain limits\r\nof time and quantity of cold, a reverse sympathy of the stomach and the\r\nskin first occurs, and afterwards a direct sympathy. In the former case the\r\nexpenditure of sensorial power by the skin being lessened, but not its\r\nproduction in the brain; the second link of the association, viz. the\r\nstomach, acquires a greater share of it. In the latter case, by the\r\ncontinuation of the deficient stimulus of heat, the torpor becomes extended\r\nto the brain itself, or to the trunks of the nerves; and universal\r\ninactivity follows.\r\n\r\n7. _Tussis a pedibus frigidis._ On standing with the feet in thawing snow,\r\nmany people are liable to incessant coughing. From the torpidity of the\r\nabsorbent vessels of the lungs, in consequence of their irritative\r\nassociations with those of the skin, they cease to absorb the saline part\r\nof the secreted mucus; and a cough is thus induced by the irritation of\r\nthis saline secretion; which is similar to that from the nostrils in frosty\r\nweather, but differs in respect to its immediate cause; the former being\r\nfrom association with a distant part, and the latter from defect of the\r\nstimulus of heat on the nostrils themselves. See Catarrhus frigidus, Class\r\nI. 2. 3. 3.\r\n\r\n8. _Tussis hepatica._ The cough of inebriates, which attends the\r\nenlargement of the liver, or a chronical inflammation of its upper\r\nmembrane, is supposed to be produced by the inconvenience the diaphragm\r\nsuffers from the compression or heat of the liver. It differs however\r\nessentially from that attending hepatitis, from its not being accompanied\r\nwith fever. And is perhaps rather owing to irritative association, or\r\nreverse sympathy, between the lungs and the liver. As occurs in sheep,\r\nwhich are liable to a perpetual dry cough, when the fleuk-worm is preying\r\non the substance of their livers. See Class II. 1. 1. 5.\r\n\r\nM. M. From half a grain to a grain of opium twice a day. A drachm of\r\nmercurial ointment rubbed on the region of the liver every night for eight\r\nor ten times.\r\n\r\n9. _Tussis arthritica._ Gout-cough. I have seen a cough, which twice\r\nrecurred at a few years distance in the same person, during his fits of the\r\ngout, with such pertinacity and violence as to resist venesection, opiates,\r\nbark, blisters, mucilages, and all the usual methods employed in coughs. It\r\nwas for a time supposed to be the hooping-cough, from the violence of the\r\naction of coughing; it continued two or three weeks, the patient never\r\nbeing able to sleep more than a few minutes at once during the whole time,\r\nand being propped up in bed with pillows night and day.\r\n\r\nAs no fever attended this violent cough, and but little expectoration, and\r\nthat of a thin and frothy kind, I suspected the membrane of the lungs to be\r\nrather torpid than inflamed, and that the saline part of the mucus not\r\nbeing absorbed stimulated them into perpetual exertion. And lastly, that\r\nthough the lungs are not sensible to cold and heat, and probably therefore\r\nless mobile; yet, as they are nevertheless liable to consent with the\r\ntorpor of cold feet, as described in Species 6 of this Genus, I suspected\r\nthis torpor of the lungs to succeed the gout in the feet, or to act a\r\nvicarious part for them.\r\n\r\n10. _Vertigo rotatoria._ In the vertigo from circumgyration the irritative\r\nmotions of vision are increased; which is evinced from the pleasure that\r\nchildren receive on being rocked in a cradle, or by swinging on a rope. For\r\nwhenever sensation arises from the production of irritative motion with\r\nless energy than natural, it is of the disagreeable kind, as from cold or\r\nhunger; but when it arises from their production with greater energy than\r\nnatural, if it be confined within certain limits, it is of the pleasurable\r\nkind, as by warmth or wine. With these increased irritative motions of\r\nvision, I suppose those of the stomach are performed with greater energy by\r\ndirect sympathy; but when the rotatory motions, which produce this\r\nagreeable vertigo, are continued too long, or are too violent, sickness of\r\nthe stomach follows; which is owing to the decreased action of that organ\r\nfrom its reverse sympathy with the increased actions of the organ of\r\nvision. For the expenditure of sensorial power by the organ of vision is\r\nalways very great, as appears by the size of the optic nerves; and is now\r\nso much increased as to deprive the next link of association of its due\r\nshare. As mentioned in Article 6 of this Genus.\r\n\r\nIn the same manner the undulations of water, or the motions of a ship, at\r\nfirst give pleasure by increasing the irritative motions belonging to the\r\nsense of vision; but produce sickness at length by expending on one part of\r\nthe associated train of irritative actions too much of that sensorial\r\npower, which usually served the whole of it; whence some other parts of the\r\ntrain acquire too little of it, and perform their actions in consequence\r\ntoo feebly, and thence become attended with disagreeable sensation.\r\n\r\nIt must also be observed, that when the irritative motions are stimulated\r\ninto unusual action, as in inebriation, they become succeeded by sensation,\r\neither of the pleasurable or painful kind; and thus a new link is\r\nintroduced between the irritative motions thus excited, and those which\r\nused to succeed them; whence the association is either dissevered or much\r\nweakened, and thus the vomiting in sea-sickness occurs from the defect of\r\nthe power of association, rather than from the general deficiency of\r\nsensorial power.\r\n\r\nWhen a blind man turns round, or when one, who is not blind, revolves in\r\nthe dark, a vertigo is produced belonging to the sense of touch. A blind\r\nman balances himself by the sense of touch, which being a less perfect\r\nmeans of determining small quantities of deviation from the perpendicular,\r\noccasions him to walk more carefully upright than those, who balance\r\nthemselves by vision. When he revolves, the irritative associations of the\r\nmuscular motions, which were used to preserve his perpendicularity, become\r\ndisordered by their new modes of successive exertion; and he begins to\r\nfall. For his feet now touch the floor in manners or directions different\r\nfrom those they have been accustomed to; and in consequence he judges less\r\nperfectly of the situation of the parts of the floor in respect to that of\r\nhis own body, and thus loses his perpendicular attitude. This may be\r\nillustrated by the curious experiment of crossing one finger over the next\r\nto it, and feeling of a nut or bullet with the ends of them. When, if the\r\neyes be closed, the nut or bullet appears to be two, from the deception of\r\nthe sense of touch.\r\n\r\nIn this vertigo from gyration, both of the sense of sight, and of the sense\r\nof touch, the primary link of the associated irritative motions is\r\nincreased in energy, and the secondary ones are increased at first by\r\ndirect sympathy; but after a time they become decreased by reverse sympathy\r\nwith the primary link, owing to the exhaustion of sensorial power in\r\ngeneral, or to the power of association in particular; because in the last\r\ncase, either pleasurable or painful sensation has been introduced between\r\nthe links of a train of irritative motions, and has dissevered, or much\r\nenfeebled them.\r\n\r\nDr. Smyth, in his Essay on Swinging in Pulmonary Consumption, has observed,\r\nthat swinging makes the pulse slower. Dr. Ewart of Bath confirmed this\r\nobservation both on himself and on Col. Cathcart, who was then hectic, and\r\nthat even on shipboard, where some degree of vertigo might be supposed\r\npreviously to exist. Dr. Currie of Liverpool not only confirmed this\r\nobservation frequently on himself, when he was also phthisical, but found\r\nthat equitation had a similar effect on him, uniformly retarding his pulse.\r\nThis curious circumstance cannot arise from the general effect of exercise,\r\nor fatigue, as in those cases the pulse becomes weaker and quicker; it must\r\ntherefore be ascribed to a degree of vertigo, which attends all those modes\r\nof motion, which we are not perpetually accustomed to.\r\n\r\nDr. Currie has further observed, that \"in cases of great debility the\r\nvoluntary muscular exertion requisite in a swing produces weariness, that\r\nis, increases debility; and that in such instances he had frequently\r\nnoticed, that the diminution of the frequency of the pulse did not take\r\nplace, but the contrary.\" These circumstances may thus be accounted for.\r\n\r\nThe links of association, which are effected in the vertigo occasioned by\r\nunusual motion, are the irritative motions of the sense of vision, those of\r\nthe stomach, and those of the heart and arteries. When the irritative ideas\r\nof vision are exerted with greater energy at the beginning of vertigo, a\r\ndegree of sensation is excited, which is of the pleasurable kind, as above\r\nmentioned; whence the associated trains of irritative motions of the\r\nstomach, and heart, and arteries, act at first with greater energy, both by\r\ndirect sympathy; and by the additional sensorial power of sensation. Whence\r\nthe pulse of a consumptive patient becomes stronger and consequently\r\nslower.\r\n\r\nBut if this vertigo becomes much greater in degree or duration, the first\r\nlink of this train of associated irritative motions expends too much of the\r\nsensorial power, which was usually employed on the whole train; and the\r\nmotions of the stomach become in consequence exerted with less energy. This\r\nappears, because in this degree of vertigo sickness supervenes, as in\r\nsea-sickness, which has been shewn to be owing to less energetic action of\r\nthe stomach. And the motions of the heart and arteries then become weaker,\r\nand in consequence more frequent, by their direct sympathy with the\r\nlessened actions of the stomach. See Supplement, I. 12. and Class II. 1. 6.\r\n7. The general weakness from fatigue is owing to a similar cause, that is,\r\nto the too great expenditure of sensorial power in the increased actions of\r\none part of the system, and the consequent deficiency of it in other parts,\r\nor in the whole.\r\n\r\nThe abatement of the heat of the skin in hectic fever by swinging, is not\r\nonly owing to the increased ventilation of cool air, but to the reverse\r\nsympathy of the motions of the cutaneous capillaries with those of the\r\nheart and arteries; which occurs in all fevers with arterial debility, and\r\na hot or dry skin. Hence during moderate swinging the action of the heart\r\nand arteries becomes stronger and slower, and the action of the\r\ncapillaries, which was before too great, as appeared by the heat of the\r\nskin, now is lessened by their reverse sympathy with that of the heart and\r\narteries. See Supplement, I. 8.\r\n\r\n11. _Vertigo visualis._ Visual vertigo. The vertigo rotatoria described\r\nabove, was induced by the rotation or undulation of external objects, and\r\nwas attended with increased action of the primary link of the associated\r\nmotions belonging to vision, and with consequent pleasure. The vertigo\r\nvisualis is owing to less perfect vision, and is not accompanied with\r\npleasurable sensation. This frequently occurs in strokes of the palsy, and\r\nis then succeeded by vomiting; it sometimes precedes epileptic fits, and\r\noften attends those, whose sight begins to be impaired by age.\r\n\r\nIn this vertigo the irritative ideas of the apparent motions of objects are\r\nless distinct, and on that account are not succeeded by their usual\r\nirritative associations of motion; but excite our attention. Whence the\r\nobjects appear to librate or circulate according to the motions of our\r\nheads, which is called dizziness; and we lose the means of balancing\r\nourselves, or preserving our perpendicularity, by vision. So that in this\r\nvertigo the motions of the associated organs are decreased by direct\r\nsympathy with their primary link of irritation; as in the preceding case of\r\nsea-sickness they are decreased by reverse sympathy.\r\n\r\nWhen vertigo affects people about fifty years of age, their sight has\r\ngenerally been suddenly impaired; and from their less accurate vision they\r\ndo not soon enough perceive the apparent motions of objects; like a person\r\nin a room, the walls of which are stained with the uniform figures of\r\nlozenges, explained in Sect. XX. 1. This is generally ascribed to\r\nindigestion; but it ceases spontaneously, as the patient acquires the habit\r\nof balancing himself by less distinct objects.\r\n\r\nA gentleman about 50 was seized with an uncommon degree of vertigo, so as\r\nto fall on the ground, and not to be able to turn his head, as he sat up\r\neither in his chair or in his bed, and this continued eight or ten weeks.\r\nAs he had many decayed teeth in his mouth, and the vertigo was preceded and\r\nsometimes accompanied by pains on one side of his head, the disease of a\r\ntooth was suspected to be the cause. And as his timidity was too great to\r\nadmit the extraction of those which were decayed; after the trial of\r\ncupping repeatedly, fomentations on his head, repeated blisters, with\r\nvalerian, Peruvian bark, musk, opium, and variety of other medicines;\r\nmercurials were used, both externally and internally, with design to\r\ninflame the membranes of the teeth, and by that means to prevent the torpor\r\nof the action of the membranes about the temple, and parietal bone; which\r\nare catenated with the membranes of the teeth by irritative association,\r\nbut not by sensitive association. The event was, that as soon as the gums\r\nbecame sore with a slight ptyalism, the pains about the head and vertigo\r\ngradually diminished, and during the soreness of his gums entirely ceased;\r\nbut I believe recurred afterwards, though in less degree.\r\n\r\nThe idea of inflaming the membranes of the teeth to produce increased\r\nsensation in them, and thus to prevent their irritative connection with\r\nthose of the cranium, was taken from the treatment of trismus, or locked\r\njaw, by endeavouring to inflame the injured tendon; which is said to\r\nprevent or to remove the spasm of the muscles of the jaw. See Class III. 1.\r\n1. 13. and 15.\r\n\r\nM. M. Emetics. Blisters. Issues about the head. Extraction of decayed\r\nteeth. Slight salivation. Sorbentia. Incitantia.\r\n\r\n12. _Vertigo ebriosa._ Vertigo from intoxication is owing to the\r\nassociation of the irritative ideas of vision with the irritative motions\r\nof the stomach. Whence when these latter become much increased by the\r\nimmoderate stimulus of wine, the irritative motions of the retina are\r\nproduced with less energy by reverse sympathy, and become at the same time\r\nsucceeded by sensation in consequence of their decreased action. See Sect.\r\nXXI. 3. and XXXV. 1. 2. So conversely when the irritative motions of vision\r\nare increased by turning round, or by our unaccustomed agitation at sea,\r\nthose of the stomach become inverted by reverse sympathy, and are attended\r\nin consequence with disagreeable sensation. Which decreased action of the\r\nstomach is in consequence of the increased expenditure of the sensorial\r\npower on the irritative ideas of vision, as explained in Vertigo rotatoria.\r\n\r\nWhence though a certain quantity of vinous spirit stimulates the whole\r\nsystem into increased action, and perhaps even increases the secretion of\r\nsensorial power in the brain; yet as soon as any degree of vertigo is\r\nproduced, it is a proof, that by the too great expenditure of sensorial\r\npower by the stomach, and its nearest associated motions, the more distant\r\nones, as those of vision, become imperfectly exerted. From hence may be\r\ndeduced the necessity of exhibiting wine in fevers with weak pulse in only\r\nappropriated quantity; because if the least intoxication be induced, some\r\npart of the system must act more feebly from the unnecessary expenditure of\r\nsensorial power.\r\n\r\n13. _Vertigo febriculosa._ Vertigo in fevers either proceeds from the\r\ngeneral deficiency of sensorial power belonging to the irritative\r\nassociations, or to a greater expenditure of it on some links of the trains\r\nand tribes of associated irritative motions. There is however a slighter\r\nvertigo attending all people, who have been long confined in bed, on their\r\nfirst rising; owing to their having been so long unused to the apparent\r\nmotions of objects in their erect posture, or as they pass by them, that\r\nthey have lost in part the habit of balancing themselves by them.\r\n\r\n14. _Vertigo cerebrosa._ Vertigo from injuries of the brain, either from\r\nexternal violence, or which attend paralytic attacks, are owing to the\r\ngeneral deficiency of sensorial power. In these distressful situations the\r\nvital motions, or those immediately necessary to life, claim their share of\r\nsensorial power in the first place, otherwise the patient must die; and\r\nthose motions, which are less necessary, feel a deficiency of it, as these\r\nof the organs of sense and muscles; which constitute vertigo; and lastly\r\nthe voluntary motions, which are still less immediately necessary to life,\r\nare frequently partially destroyed, as in palsy; or totally, as in\r\napoplexy.\r\n\r\n15. _Murmur aurium vertiginosum._ The vertiginous murmur in the ears, or\r\nnoise in the head, is compared to the undulations of the sound of bells, or\r\nto the humming of bees. It frequently attends people about 60 years of age;\r\nand like the visual vertigo described above is owing to our hearing less\r\nperfectly from the gradual inirritability of the organ on the approach of\r\nage; and the disagreeable sensation of noise attending it is owing to the\r\nless energetic action of these irritative motions; which not being\r\nsufficiently distinct to excite their usual associations become succeeded\r\nby our attention, like the indistinct view of the apparent motions of\r\nobjects mentioned in vertigo visualis. This may be better understood from\r\nconsidering the use, which blind men make of these irritative sounds, which\r\nthey have taught themselves to attend to, but which escape the notice of\r\nothers. The late blind Justice Fielding walked for the first time into my\r\nroom, when he once visited me, and after speaking a few words said, \"this\r\nroom is about 22 feet long, 18 wide, and 12 high;\" all which he guessed by\r\nthe ear with great accuracy. Now if these irritative sounds from the\r\npartial loss of hearing do not correspond with the size or usual echoes of\r\nthe places, where we are; their catenation with other irritative ideas, as\r\nthose of vision, becomes dissevered or disturbed; and we attend to them in\r\nconsequence, which I think unravels this intricate circumstance of noises\r\nbeing always heard in the head, when the sense of hearing begins to be\r\nimpaired, from whatever cause it occurs.\r\n\r\nThis ringing in the ears also attends the vertigo from intoxication; for\r\nthe irritative ideas of sound are then more weakly excited in consequence\r\nof the deficiency of the sensorial power of association. As is known by\r\nthis also being attended with disagreeable sensation, and by its\r\naccompanying other diseases of debility, as strokes on the head, fainting\r\nfits, and paralytic seizures. For in this vertigo from intoxication so much\r\nsensorial power in general is expended on the increased actions of the\r\nstomach, and its nearest connections, as the capillaries of the skin; that\r\nthere is a deficiency for the purposes of the other irritative associations\r\nof motions usually connected with it. This auditory vertigo attends both\r\nthe rotatory and the visual vertigo above mentioned; in the former it is\r\nintroduced by reverse sympathy, that is, by the diminution of sensorial\r\npower; too great a quantity of it being expended on the increased\r\nirritative motions of vision; in the latter it is produced either by the\r\nsame causes which produce the visual vertigo, or by direct sympathy with\r\nit. See Sect. XX. 7.\r\n\r\nM. M. Stimulate the internal ear by ether, or with essential oil diluted\r\nwith expressed oil, or with a solution of opium in wine, or in water. Or\r\nwith salt and water.\r\n\r\n16. _Tactus, gustus, olfactius vertiginosi._ Vertiginous touch, taste, and\r\nsmell. In the vertigo of intoxication, when the patient lies down in bed,\r\nit sometimes happens even in the dark, that the bed seems to librate under\r\nhim, and he is afraid of falling out of it. The same occurs to people, who\r\nare sea-sick, even when they lie down in the dark. In these the irritative\r\nmotions of the nerves of touch, or irritative tangible ideas, are performed\r\nwith less energy, in one case by reverse sympathy with the stomach, in the\r\nother by reverse sympathy with the nerves of vision, and in consequence\r\nbecome attended with sensation, and produce the fear of falling by other\r\nassociations.\r\n\r\nA vertigo of the sense of touch may be produced, if any one turns round for\r\na time with his eyes shut, and suddenly stops without opening them; for he\r\nwill for a time seem to be still going forwards; which is difficult to\r\nexplain. See the notes at the end of the first and second volume belonging\r\nto Sect. XX. 6.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of some fevers, along with incessant vomiting, the\r\npatients complain of disagreeable tastes in their mouth, and disagreeable\r\nodours; which are to be ascribed to the general debility of the great\r\ntrains and tribes of associated irritative motions, and to be explained\r\nfrom their direct sympathy with the decreased action of a sick stomach; or\r\nfrom the less secretion of sensorial power in the brain. These organs of\r\nsense are constantly stimulated into action by the saliva or by the air;\r\nhence, like the sense of hunger, when they are torpid from want of\r\nstimulus, or from want of sensorial power, pain or disagreeable sensation\r\nensues, as of hunger, or faintness, or sickness in one case; and the ideas\r\nof bad tastes or odours in the other. This accords with the laws of\r\ncausation, Sect. IV. 5.\r\n\r\n17. _Pulsus mollis in vomitione._ The softness of the pulse in the act of\r\nvomiting is caused by direct association between the heart and the stomach;\r\nas explained in Sect. XXV. 17. A great slowness of the pulsation of the\r\nheart sometimes attends sickness, and even with intermissions of it, as in\r\nthe exhibition of too great a dose of digitalis.\r\n\r\n18. _Pulsus intermittens a ventriculo._ When the pulse first begins to\r\nintermit, it is common for the patient to bring up a little air from his\r\nstomach; which if he accomplishes before the intermission occurs, always\r\nprevents it; whence that this debility of the heart is owing to the direct\r\nassociation of its motions with those of the stomach is well evinced. See\r\nSect. XXV. 17.\r\n\r\nI this morning saw Mr. ----, who has long had at times an unequal pulse,\r\nwith indigestion and flatulency, and occasional asthma; he was seized two\r\ndays ago with diarrhoea, and this morning with sickness, and his pulse was\r\nevery way unequal. After an emetic his pulse still continued very\r\nintermittent and unequal. He then took some breakfast of toast and butter,\r\nand tea, and to my great surprise his pulse became immediately perfectly\r\nregular, about 100 in a minute, and not weak, by this stimulus on his\r\nstomach.\r\n\r\nA person, who for many years had had a frequent intermission of his pulse,\r\nand occasional palpitation of his heart, was relieved from them both for a\r\ntime by taking about four drops of a saturated solution of arsenic three or\r\nfour times a day for three or four days. As this intermission of the pulse\r\nis occasioned by the direct association of the motions of the heart with\r\nthose of the stomach, the indication of cure must be to strengthen the\r\naction of the stomach by the bark. Spice. Moderate quantities of wine. A\r\nblister. Half a grain of opium twice a day. Solution of arsenic?\r\n\r\n19. _Febris inirritativa._ Inirritative fever described in Class I. 2. 1.\r\n1. belongs to this place, as it consists of disordered trains and tribes of\r\nassociated irritative motions, with lessened actions of the associated\r\norgans. In this fever the pulsations of the heart and arteries are weakened\r\nor lessened, not only in the cold paroxysm, as in the irritative fever, but\r\nalso in the hot paroxysm. The capillary arteries or glands have their\r\nactions nevertheless increased after the first cold fit, as appears by the\r\ngreater production of heat, and the glow of arterial blood, in the\r\ncutaneous vessels; and lastly, the action of the stomach is much impaired\r\nor destroyed, as appears by the total want of appetite to solid food.\r\nWhence it would seem, that the torpid motions of the stomach, whatever may\r\noccasion them, are a very frequent cause of continued fever with weak\r\npulse; and that these torpid motions of the stomach do not sufficiently\r\nexcite the sensorial power of association, which contributes in health to\r\nactuate the heart and arteries along with the irritation produced by the\r\nstimulus of the blood; and hence the actions of these organs are weaker.\r\nAnd lastly, that the accumulation of the sensorial power of association,\r\nwhich ought to be expended on the motions of the heart and arteries,\r\nbecomes now exerted on the cutaneous and pulmonary capillaries. See\r\nSupplement I. 8. and Sect. XXXV. 1. 1. and XXXIII. 2. 10.\r\n\r\nI have dwelt longer on the vertiginous diseases in this genus, both because\r\nof their great intricacy, and because they seem to open a road to the\r\nknowledge of fever, which consists of associated trains and tribes of\r\nirritative or sensitive motions, which are sometimes mixed with the\r\nvertiginous ones, and sometimes separate from them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nORDO II.\r\n\r\n_Decreased Associate Motions._\r\n\r\nGENUS II.\r\n\r\n_Catenated with Sensitive Motions._\r\n\r\nIn this genus the sensorial power of association is exerted with less\r\nenergy, and thence the actions produced by it are less than natural; and\r\npain is produced in consequence, according to the fifth law of animal\r\ncausation, Sect. IV. This pain is generally attended with coldness of the\r\naffected part, and is seldom succeeded by inflammation of it. This\r\ndecreased action of the secondary link of the associated motions, belonging\r\nto this genus, is owing to the previous exhaustion of sensorial power\r\neither in the increased actions of the primary link of the associated\r\nmotions, or by the pain which attends them; both which are frequently the\r\nconsequence of the stimulus of something external to the affected fibres.\r\n\r\nAs pain is produced either by excess or defect of the natural exertions of\r\nthe fibres, it is not, considered separately, a criterion of the presence\r\nof either. In the associations belonging to this genus the sensation of\r\npain or pleasure produces or attends the primary link of the associated\r\nmotions, and very often gives name to the disease.\r\n\r\nWhen great pain exists without causing any fibrous motions, I conjecture\r\nthat it contributes to exhaust or expend the general quantity of sensorial\r\npower; because people are fatigued by enduring pain, till at length they\r\nsleep. Which is contrary to what I had perhaps erroneously supposed in\r\nSect. XXXV. 2. 3. If it causes fibrous motions, it then takes the name of\r\nsensation, according to the definition of sensation in Sect. II. 2. 9.; and\r\nincreased fibrous action or inflammation is the consequence. This\r\ncircumstance of the general exhaustion of sensorial power by the existence\r\nof pain will assist in explaining many of the diseases of this genus.\r\n\r\nMany of the canals of the body, as the urethra, the bile-duct, the throat,\r\nhave the motions of their two extremities associated by having been\r\naccustomed to feel pleasurable or painful sensations at the same time or in\r\nsuccession. This is termed sensitive association, though those painful or\r\npleasurable sensations do not cause the motions, but only attend them; and\r\nare thus perhaps, strictly speaking, only catenated with them.\r\n\r\nSPECIES.\r\n\r\n1. _Torpor genæ a dolore dentis._ In tooth-ach there is generally a\r\ncoldness of the cheek, which is sensible to the hand, and is attended in\r\nsome degree with the pain of cold. The cheek and tooth have frequently been\r\nengaged in pleasurable action at the same time during the masticating of\r\nour food; whence they have acquired sensitive associations. The torpor of\r\nthe cheek may have for its cause the too great expenditure of sensorial\r\npower by the painful sensation of the membranes of the diseased tooth;\r\nwhence the membranes of the cheek associated with those of the alveolar\r\nprocess are deprived of their natural share of it, and become torpid; thus\r\nthey produce less secretions, and less heat, and the pain of cold is the\r\nconsequence. This torpor of the vessels of the cheek cannot be produced by\r\nthe activity of the sensorial power of sensation; for then they would act\r\nmore violently than natural, or become inflamed. And though the pain by\r\nexhausting so much sensorial power may be a remote cause, it is the defeat\r\nof the power of association, which is the immediate cause of the torpor of\r\nthe cheek.\r\n\r\nAfter some hours this pain occasioned by the torpor of the vessels of the\r\ncheek either gradually ceases along with the pain of the diseased tooth;\r\nor, by the accumulation of sensorial power during their state of torpor,\r\nthe capillaries of the cheek act with greater violence, and produce more\r\nsecretions, and heat, and consequent tumour, and inflammation. In this\r\nstate the pain of the diseased tooth ceases; as the sensorial power of\r\nsensation is now expended on the inflamed vessels of the cheek. It is\r\nprobable that most other internal membranous inflammations begin in a\r\nsimilar manner; whence there may seem to be a double kind of sensitive\r\nassociation; first, with decreased action of the associated organ, and then\r\nwith increased action of it; but the latter is in this case simply the\r\nconsequence of the former; that is, the tumor or inflammation of the cheek\r\nis in consequence of its previous quiescence or torpor.\r\n\r\n2. _Stranguria a dolore vesicæ._ The strangury, which has its origin from\r\npain at the neck of the bladder, consists of a pain in the external\r\nextremity of the urethra or of the glans penis of men, and probably in the\r\nexternal termination of the urethra or of the clitoris of women; and is\r\nowing to the sympathy of these with some distant parts, generally with the\r\nother end of the urethra; an endeavour and difficulty of making water\r\nattends this pain.\r\n\r\nIts remote cause is from the internal or external use of cantharides, which\r\nstimulate the neck of the bladder; or from a stone, which whenever it is\r\npushed into the neck of the bladder, gives this pain of strangury, but not\r\nat other times; and hence it is felt most severely in this case after\r\nhaving made water.\r\n\r\nThe sensations or sensitive motions of the glans penis, and of the\r\nsphincter of the bladder, have been accustomed to exist together during the\r\ndischarge of the urine; and hence the two ends of the urethra sympathize by\r\nassociation. When there is a stone at the neck of the bladder, which is not\r\nso large or rough as to inflame the part, the sphincter of the bladder\r\nbecomes stimulated into pain; but as the glans penis is for the purposes of\r\ncopulation more sensitive than the sphincter of the bladder, as soon as it\r\nbecomes affected with pain by the association above mentioned, the\r\nsensation at the neck of the bladder ceases; and then the pain of the glans\r\npenis would seem to be associated with the irritative motions only of the\r\nsphincter of the bladder, and not with the sensitive ones of it. But a\r\ncircumstance similar to this occurs in epileptic fits, which at first are\r\ninduced by disagreeable sensation, and afterwards seem to occur without\r\nprevious pain, from the suddenness in which they follow and relieve the\r\npain, which occasioned them. From this analogy I imagine the pain of the\r\nglans penis is associated with the pain of the sphincter of the bladder;\r\nbut that _as soon as the greater pain in a more sensible part is produced;\r\nthe lesser one, which occasioned it, ceases_; and that this is one of the\r\nlaws of sensitive association. See Sect. XXXV. 2. 1.\r\n\r\nA young man had by an accident swallowed a large spoonful or more of\r\ntincture of cantharides; as soon as he began to feel the pain of strangury,\r\nhe was advised to drink large quantities of warmish water; to which, as\r\nsoon as it could be got, some gum arabic was added. In an hour or two he\r\ndrank by intervals of a few minutes about two gallons of water, and\r\ndischarged his urine every four or five minutes. A little blood was voided\r\ntowards the end, but he suffered no ill consequence.\r\n\r\nM. M. Warm water internally. Clysters of warm water. Fomentation. Opium.\r\nSolution of fixed alkali supersaturated with carbonic acid. A bougie may be\r\nused to push back a stone into the bladder. See Class I. 1. 3. 10.\r\n\r\n3. _Stranguria convulsiva._ The convulsive strangury, like that before\r\ndescribed, is probably occasioned by the torpor or defective action of the\r\npainful part in consequence of the too great expenditure of sensorial power\r\non the primary link of the associated motions, as no heat or inflammation\r\nattends this violent pain. This kind of strangury recurs by stated periods,\r\nand sometimes arises to so great a degree, that convulsion or temporary\r\nmadness terminates each period of it. It affects women oftener than men, is\r\nattended with cold extremities without fever, and is distinguished from the\r\nstone of the bladder by the regularity of its periods, and by the pain\r\nbeing not increased after making water.\r\n\r\nOn introducing the catheter sometimes part of the urine will come away and\r\nnot the whole, which is difficult to explain; but may arise from the\r\nweakness of the muscular fibres of the bladder; which are not liable\r\nsuddenly to contract themselves so far as to exclude the whole of the\r\nurine. In some old people, who have experienced a long retention of urine,\r\nthe bladder never regains the power of completely emptying itself; and many\r\nwho are beginning to be weak from age can make water a second time, a few\r\nminutes after they supposed they had emptied the bladder.\r\n\r\nI have believed this pain to originate from sympathy with some distant\r\npart, as from ascarides in the rectum, or from piles in women; or from\r\ncaruncles in the urethra about the caput gallinaginis in men; and that the\r\npain has been in the glans or clitoris by reverse sympathy of these more\r\nsensible parts with those above mentioned.\r\n\r\nM.

When a gall-stone is protruded from the gall-bladder\r\na little way into the end of the gall-duct, the pain is felt at the other\r\nend of the gall-duct, which terminates in the duodenum. For the actions of\r\nthe two terminations of this canal are associated together from the same\r\nstreams of bile passing through them in succession, exactly as the two\r\nterminations of the urethra have their actions associated, as described in\r\nSpecies 2 and 3 of this genus. But as the intestinal termination of the\r\nbile-duct is made more sensible for the purpose of bringing down more bile,\r\nwhen it is stimulated by new supplies of food from the stomach, it falls\r\ninto violent pain from association; and then the pain on the region of the\r\ngall-bladder ceases, exactly as above explained in the account of the pain\r\nof the glans penis from a stone in the sphincter of the bladder.\r\n\r\nThe common bile-duct opens into the intestine exactly at what is called the\r\npit of the stomach; and hence it has sometimes happened, that this pain\r\nfrom association with the sensation of a gall-stone at the other end of the\r\nbile-duct has been mistaken for a pain of the stomach.\r\n\r\nFor the method of cure see Class I. 1. 3. 8. to which should be added the\r\nuse of strong electric shocks passed through the bile-duct from the pit of\r\nthe stomach to the back, and from one side to the other. A case of the good\r\neffect of electricity in the jaundice is related in Sect. XXX. 2. And\r\nanother case, where it promoted the passage of a painful gall-stone, is\r\ndescribed by Dr. Hall, experienced on himself. Trans. of the College at\r\nPhiladelphia, Vol. I. p. 192.\r\n\r\nHalf a pint of warm water two or three times a day is much recommended to\r\ndilute the inspissated bile.\r\n\r\n5. _Dolor pharyngis ab acido gastrico._ The two ends of the throat\r\nsympathize by sensitive association in the same manner as the other canals\r\nabove mentioned, namely, the urethra and the bile-duct; hence when too\r\ngreat acidity of undigested aliment, or the carbonic acid air, which\r\nescapes in fermentation, stimulates the cardia ventriculi, or lower end of\r\nthe gula, into pain; the pharinx, or upper end of it, is affected with\r\ngreater pain, or a disagreeable sensation of heat.\r\n\r\n6. _Pruritus narium a vermibus._ The itching of the nose from worms in the\r\nintestines is another curious instance of the sensitive associations of the\r\nmotions of membranes; especially of those which constitute the canals of\r\nthe body. Previous to the deglutition of agreeable food, as milk in our\r\nearliest infancy, an agreeable odour affects the membrane, which lines the\r\nnostrils; and hence an association seems to take place between the\r\nagreeable sensations produced by food in the stomach and bowels, and the\r\nagreeable sensations of the nostrils. The existence of ascarides in the\r\nrectum I believe produces this itching of the nostrils more than the worms\r\nin other parts of the intestines; as we have already seen, that the\r\nterminations of canals sympathize more than their other parts, as in the\r\nurethra and gall-ducts. See Class I. 1. 5. 9. IV. 1. 2. 9.\r\n\r\n7. _Cephalæa._ Head-ach. In cold fits of the ague, the head-ach arises from\r\nconsent with some torpid viscus, like the pain of the loins. After\r\ndrunkenness the head-ach is very common, owing to direct sympathy of the\r\nmembranes of the head with those of the stomach; which is become torpid\r\nafter the too violent stimulus of the preceding intoxication; and is hence\r\nremoveable by spirit of wine, or opium, exhibited in smaller quantities. In\r\nsome constitutions these head-achs are induced, when the feet are exposed\r\nto much external cold; in this case the feet should be covered with oiled\r\nsilk, which prevents the evaporation of the perspirable matter, and thence\r\ndiminishes one cause of external cold.\r\n\r\nM. M. Valerian in powder two drams three or four times a day is\r\nrecommended. The bark. Chalybeates. A grain of opium twice a day for a long\r\ntime. From five to ten drops of the saturated solution of arsenic two or\r\nthree times a day. See Class I. 2. 4. 11. A lady once assured me, that when\r\nher head-ach was coming on, she drank three pints (pounds) of hot water, as\r\nhastily as she could; which prevented the progress of the disease. A\r\nsolution of arsenic is recommended by Dr. Fowler of York. Very strong\r\nerrhines are said sometimes to cure head-achs taken at the times the pain\r\nrecurs, till a few drops of blood issue from the nostrils. As one grain of\r\nturpeth mineral (vitriolic calx of mercury) mixed with ten grains of fine\r\nsugar. Euphorbium or cayan pepper mixed with sugar, and used with caution\r\nas an errhine. See the M. M. of the next Species.\r\n\r\n8. _Hemicrania._ Pain on one side of the head. This disease is attended\r\nwith cold skin, and hence whatever may be the remote cause, the immediate\r\none seems to be want of stimulus, either of heat or distention, or of some\r\nother unknown stimulus in the painful part; or in those, with which it is\r\nassociated. The membranes in their natural state are only irritable by\r\ndistention; in their diseased state, they are sensible like muscular\r\nfibres. Hence a diseased tooth may render the neighbouring membranes\r\nsensible, and is frequently the cause of this disease.\r\n\r\nSometimes the stomach is torpid along with the pained membrane of the head;\r\nand then sickness and inappetency attends either as a cause or consequence.\r\nThe natural cure of hemicrania is the accumulation of sensorial power\r\nduring the rest or sickness of the patient. Mrs. ---- is frequently liable\r\nto hemicrania with sickness, which is probably owing to a diseased tooth;\r\nthe paroxysm occurs irregularly, but always after some previous fatigue, or\r\nother cause of debility. She lies in bed, sick, and without taking any\r\nsolid food, and very little of fluids, and those of the aqueous kind, and,\r\nafter about 48 or 50 hours, rises free from complaint. Similar to this is\r\nthe recovery from cold paroxysms of fever, from the torpor occasioned by\r\nfear, and from syncope; which are all owing to the accumulation of\r\nsensorial power during the inactivity of the system. Hence it appears,\r\nthat, though when the sensorial power of volition is much exhausted by\r\nfatigue, it can be restored by eight or ten hours of sleep; yet, when the\r\nsensorial power of irritation is exhausted by fatigue, that it requires two\r\nwhole solar or lunar days of rest, before it can be restored.\r\n\r\nThe late Dr. Monro asserted in his lectures, that he cured the hemicrania,\r\nor megrim, by a strong vomit, and a brisk purge immediately after it. This\r\nmethod succeeds best if opium and the bark are given in due quantity after\r\nthe operation of the cathartic; and with still more certainty, if bleeding\r\nin small quantity is premised, where the pulse will admit of it. See Sect.\r\nXXXV. 2. 1.\r\n\r\nThe pain generally affects one eye, and spreads a little way on that side\r\nof the nose, and may sometimes be relieved by pressing or cutting the\r\nnerve, where it passes into the bone of the orbit above the eye. When it\r\naffects a small defined part on the parietal bone on one side, it is\r\ngenerally termed Clavus hystericus, and is always I believe owing to a\r\ndiseased dens molaris. The tendons of the muscles, which serve the office\r\nof mastication, have been extended into pain at the same time, that the\r\nmembranous coverings of the roots of the teeth have been compressed into\r\npain, during the biting or mastication of hard bodies. Hence when the\r\nmembranes, which cover the roots of the teeth, become affected with pain by\r\na beginning decay, or perhaps by the torpor or coldness of the dying part\r\nof the tooth, the tendons and membranous fascia of the muscles about the\r\nsame side of the head become affected with violent pain by their sensitive\r\nassociations: and as soon as this associated pain takes place, the pain of\r\nthe tooth entirely ceases, as explained in the second species of this\r\ngenus.\r\n\r\nA remarkable circumstance attends this kind of hemicrania, viz. that it\r\nrecurs by periods like those of intermittent fevers, as explained in the\r\nSection on Catenation of Motions; these periods sometimes correspond with\r\nalternate lunar or solar days like tertian agues, and that even when a\r\ndecaying tooth is evidently the cause; which has been evinced by the cure\r\nof the disease by extracting the tooth. At other times they observe the\r\nmonthly lunations, and seem to be induced by the debility, which attends\r\nmenstruation.\r\n\r\nThe dens sapientiæ, or last tooth of the upper jaw, frequently decays\r\nfirst, and gives hemicrania over the eye on the same side. The first or\r\nsecond grinder in the under-jaw is liable to give violent pain about the\r\nmiddle of the parietal bone, or side of the head, on the same side, which\r\nis generally called the Clavus hystericus, of which an instructive case is\r\nrelated in Sect. XXXV. 2. 1.\r\n\r\nM. M. Detect and extract the diseased tooth. Cut the affected nerve, or\r\nstimulate the diseased membrane by acu-puncture. Venesection to six ounces\r\nby the lancet or by leeches. A strong emetic and a subsequent cathartic;\r\nand then an opiate and the bark. Pass small electric shocks through the\r\npained membrane, and through the teeth on the same side. Apply vitriolic\r\nether externally, and a grain of opium with camphor internally, to the\r\ncheek on the affected side, where a diseased tooth may be suspected. Foment\r\nthe head with warm vinegar. Drink two large spoonfuls of vinegar. Stimulate\r\nthe gums of the suspected teeth by oil of cloves, by opium. See Class I. 1.\r\n4. 4. Snuff volatile spirit of vinegar up the nostrils. Lastly, in\r\npermanent head-achs, as in permanent vertigo, I have seen good effect by\r\nthe use of mercurial ointment rubbed on the shaved head or about the\r\nthroat, till a mild salivation commences, which by inflaming the membranes\r\nof the teeth may prevent their irritative sympathy with those of the\r\ncranium. Thus by inflaming the tendon, which is the cause of locked jaw,\r\nand probably by inflaming the wound, which is the cause of hydrophobia,\r\nthose diseases may be cured, by disuniting the irritative sympathy between\r\nthose parts, which may not possess any sensitive sympathy. This idea is\r\nwell worth our attention.\r\n\r\n_Otalgia._ Ear-ach is another disease occasioned by the sympathy of the\r\nmembranes of the ear with those which invest or surround a decaying tooth,\r\nas I have had frequent reason to believe; and is frequently relieved by\r\nfilling the ear with tincture of opium. See Class I. 2. 4.\r\n\r\n9. _Dolor humeri in hepatitide._ In the efforts of excluding the fæces and\r\nurine the muscles of the shoulders are exerted to compress the air in the\r\nlungs, that the diaphragm may be pressed down. Hence the distention of the\r\ntendons or fibres of these muscles is associated with the distention of the\r\ntendons or fibres of the diaphragm; and when the latter are pained by the\r\nenlargement or heat of the inflamed liver, the former sympathize with them.\r\nSometimes but one shoulder is affected, sometimes both; it is probable that\r\nmany other pains, which are termed rheumatic, have a similar origin, viz.\r\nfrom sensitive associations.\r\n\r\nAs no inflammation is produced in consequence of this pain of the shoulder,\r\nit seems to be owing to inaction of the membranous part from defect of the\r\nsensorial power of association, of which the primary link is the inflamed\r\nmembrane of the liver; which now expends so much of the sensorial power in\r\ngeneral by its increased action, that the membranes about the shoulder,\r\nwhich are links of association with it, become deprived of their usual\r\nshare, and consequently fall into torpor.\r\n\r\n10. _Torpor pedum in eruptione variolarum._ At the commencement of the\r\neruption of the small-pox, when the face and breast of children are very\r\nhot, their extremities are frequently cold. This I ascribe to sensitive\r\nassociation between the different parts of the skin; whence when a part\r\nacts too violently, the other part is liable to act too weakly; and the\r\nskin of the face being affected first in the eruption of the small-pox, the\r\nskin of the feet becomes cold in consequence by reverse sympathy.\r\n\r\nM. M. Cover the feet with flannel, and expose the face and bosom to cool\r\nair, which in a very short time both warms the feet and cools the face; and\r\nhence what is erroneously called a rash, but which is probably a too hasty\r\neruption of the small-pox, disappears; and afterwards fewer and more\r\ndistinct eruptions of the small-pox supervene.\r\n\r\n11. _Testium dolor nephriticus._ The pain and retraction of the testicle on\r\nthe same side, when there is a stone in the ureter, is to be ascribed to\r\nsensitive association; whether the connecting cause be a branch of the same\r\nnerve, or from membranes, which have been frequently affected at the same\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n12. _Dolor digiti minimi sympatheticus._ When any one accidentally strikes\r\nhis elbow against any hard body, a tingling pain runs down to the little\r\nfinger end. This is owing to sensitive association of motions by means of\r\nthe same branch of a nerve, as in hemicrania from a decaying tooth the pain\r\nis owing to the sensitive association of tendons or membranes.\r\n\r\n13. _Dolor brachii in hydrope pectoris._ The pain in the left arm which\r\nattends some dropsies of the chest, is explained in Sect. XXIX. 5. 2. 10.\r\nwhich resembles the pain of the little finger from a percussion of the\r\nnerve at the elbow in the preceding article. A numbness of this kind is\r\nproduced over the whole leg, when the crural nerve is much compressed by\r\nsitting for a time with one leg crossed over the other.\r\n\r\nMr. ----, about sixty, had for two years been affected with difficulty of\r\nrespiration on any exertion, with pain about the sternum, and of his left\r\narm; which last was more considerable than is usual in dropsy of the chest;\r\nsome months ago the pain of his arm, after walking a mile or two, became\r\nexcessive, with coldness and numbness; and on the next day the back of the\r\nhand, and a part of the arm swelled, and became inflamed, which relieved\r\nthe pain; and was taken for the gout, and continued several days. He after\r\nsome months became dropsical both in respect to his chest and limbs, and\r\nwas six or seven times perfectly relieved by one dram of saturated tincture\r\nof digitalis, taken two or three times a day for a few days in a glass of\r\npeppermint water. He afterwards breathed oxygen gas undiluted, in the\r\nquantity of six or eight gallons a day for three or four weeks without any\r\neffect, and sunk at length from general debility.\r\n\r\nIn this instructive case I imagine the pressure or stimulus of one part of\r\nthe nerve within the chest caused the other part, which serves the arm, to\r\nbecome torpid, and consequently cold by sympathy; and that the inflammation\r\nwas the consequence of the previous torpor and coldness of the arm, in the\r\nsame manner as the swelling and inflammation of the cheek in tooth-ach, in\r\nthe first species of this genus; and that many rheumatic inflammations are\r\nthus produced by sympathy with some distant part.\r\n\r\n14. _Diarrhoea a dentitione._ The diarrhoea, which frequently attends\r\ndentition, is the consequence of indigestion; the aliment acquires chemical\r\nchanges, and by its acidity acts as a cathartic; and changes the yellow\r\nbile into green, which is evacuated along with indigested parts of the\r\ncoagulum of milk. The indigestion is owing to the torpor of the stomach and\r\nintestines caused by their association with the membranes of the gums,\r\nwhich are now stimulated into great exertion with pain; both which\r\ncontribute to expend the general quantity of sensorial power, which belongs\r\nto this membranous association; and thus the stomach and intestines act\r\nwith less than their natural energy. This is generally esteemed a\r\nfavourable symptom in difficult dentition, as the pain of the alveolar\r\nmembranes exhausts the sensorial power without producing convulsions for\r\nits relief. See Class I. 1. 4. 5. And the diarrhoea ceases, as the tooth\r\nadvances.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nORDO II.\r\n\r\n_Decreased Associate Motions._\r\n\r\nGENUS III.\r\n\r\n_Catenated with Voluntary Motions._\r\n\r\nSPECIES.\r\n\r\n1. _Titubatio linguæ._ Impediment of speech is owing to the associations of\r\nthe motions of the organs of speech being interrupted or dissevered by\r\nill-employed sensation or sensitive motions, as by awe, bashfulness,\r\nambition of shining, or fear of not succeeding, and the person uses\r\nvoluntary efforts in vain to regain the broken associations, as explained\r\nin Sect. XVII. 1. 10. and XVII. 2. 10.\r\n\r\nThe broken association is generally between the first consonant and the\r\nsucceeding vowel; as in endeavouring to pronounce the word parable, the p\r\nis voluntarily repeated again and again, but the remainder of the word does\r\nnot follow, because the association between it and the next vowel is\r\ndissevered.\r\n\r\nM. M. The art of curing this defect is to cause the stammerer to repeat the\r\nword, which he finds difficult to speak, eight or ten times without the\r\ninitial letter, in a strong voice, or with an aspirate before it, as\r\narable, or harable; and at length to speak it very softly with the initial\r\nletter p, parable. This should be practised for weeks or months upon every\r\nword, which the stammerer hesitates in pronouncing. To this should be added\r\nmuch commerce with mankind, in order to acquire a carelessness about the\r\nopinions of others.\r\n\r\n2. _Chorea St. Viti._ In the St. Vitus's dance the patient can at any time\r\nlie still in bed, which shews the motions not to be convulsive; and he can\r\nat different times voluntarily exert every muscle of his body; which\r\nevinces, that they are not paralytic. In this disease the principal muscle\r\nin any designed motion obeys the will; but those muscles, whose motions\r\nwere associated with the principal one, do not act; as their association is\r\ndissevered, and thus the arm or leg is drawn outward, or inward, or\r\nbackward, instead of upward or forward, with various gesticulations exactly\r\nresembling the impediment of speech.\r\n\r\nThis disease is frequently left after the itch has been too hastily cured.\r\nSee Convulsio dolorifica, Class III. 1. 1. 6. A girl about eighteen, after\r\nwearing a mercurial girdle to cure the itch, acquired the Chorea St. Viti\r\nin so universal a manner, that her speech became affected as well as her\r\nlimbs; and there was evidently a disunion of the common trains of ideas; as\r\nthe itch was still among the younger children of the family, she was\r\nadvised to take her sister as a bedfellow, and thus received the itch\r\nagain; and the dance of St. Vitus gradually ceased. See Class II. 1. 5. 6.\r\n\r\nM. M. Give the patient the itch again. Calomel a grain every night, or\r\nsublimate a quarter of a grain twice a day for a fortnight. Steel. Bark.\r\nWarm-bath. Cold-bath. Opium. Venesection once at the beginning of the\r\ndisease. Electricity. Perpetual slow and repeated efforts to move each limb\r\nin the designed direction, as in the titubatio linguæ above described.\r\n\r\n3. _Risus._ Laughter is a perpetual interruption of voluntary exertion by\r\nthe interposition of pleasurable sensation; which not being checked by any\r\nimportant consequences rises into pain, and requires to be relieved or\r\nmoderated by the frequent repetition of voluntary exertion. See Sect.\r\nXXXIV. 1. 4. and Class III. 1. 1. 4. and IV. 1. 3. 3.\r\n\r\n4. _Tremor ex irâ._ The trembling of the limbs from anger. The interruption\r\nof the voluntary associations of motions by anger, originates from too\r\ngreat a part of the sensorial power being exerted on the organs of sense;\r\nwhence the muscles, which ought to support the body upright, are deprived\r\nof their due quantity, and tremble from debility. See Class III. 2. 1. 1.\r\n\r\n5. _Rubor ex irâ._ Redness from anger. Anger is an excess of aversion, that\r\nis of voluntarity not yet employed. It is excited by the pain of offended\r\npride; when it is employed it becomes outrage, cruelty, insanity. The\r\ncutaneous capillaries, especially those of the face, are more mobile, that\r\nis, more easily excited into increased action, or more easily become\r\ntorpid, from less variation of sensorial power, than any other parts of the\r\nsystem, which is owing to their being perpetually subject to the\r\nvicissitudes of heat and cold, and of extension and corrugation. Hence,\r\nwhen an excess of voluntarity exists without being immediately expended in\r\nthe actions of the large muscles, the capillary arteries and glands acquire\r\nmore energetic action, and a flushed skin is produced, with increased\r\nsecretion of perspirable matter, and consequent heat, owing to the pause or\r\ninterruption of voluntary action; and thus the actions of these cutaneous\r\nvessels become associated between the irascent ideas and irascent muscular\r\nactions, which are thus for a time interrupted.\r\n\r\n6. _Rubor criminati._ The blushing of accused people, whether guilty or\r\nnot, appears to be owing to circumstances similar to that of anger; for in\r\nthese situations there is always a sudden voluntarity, or wish, of clearing\r\ntheir characters arises in the mind of the accused person; which, before an\r\nopportunity is given for it to be expended on the large muscles, influences\r\nthe capillary arteries and glands, as in the preceding article. Whence the\r\nincreased actions of the capillaries, and the consequent redness and heat,\r\nbecome exerted between the voluntary ideas of self-defence, and the\r\nmuscular actions necessary for that purpose; which last are thus for a time\r\ninterrupted or delayed.\r\n\r\nEven in the blush of modesty or bashfulness there is a self-condemnation\r\nfor some supposed defect or indecorum, and a sudden voluntarity, or wish,\r\nof self-defence; which not being expended in actions of the larger muscles\r\nexcites the capillaries into action; which in these subjects are more\r\nmobile than in others.\r\n\r\nThe blush of young girls on coming into an assembly room, where they expect\r\ntheir dress, and steps, and manner to be examined, as in dancing a minuet,\r\nmay have another origin; and may be considered as a hot fit of returning\r\nconfidence, after a previous cold fit of fear.\r\n\r\n7. _Tarditas paralytica._ By a stroke of the palsy or apoplexy it\r\nfrequently happens, that those ideas, which were associated in trains,\r\nwhose first link was a voluntary idea, have their connection dissevered;\r\nand the patient is under the necessity by repeated efforts slowly to renew\r\ntheir associations. In this situation those words, which have the fewest\r\nother words associated with them, as the proper names of persons or places,\r\nare the most difficult to recollect. And in those efforts of recollection\r\nthe word opposite to the word required is often produced, as hot for cold,\r\nwinter for summer, which is owing to our associating our ideas of things by\r\ntheir opposites as well as by their similitudes, and in some instances\r\nperhaps more frequently, or more forcibly. Other paralytic patients are\r\nliable to give wrong names to external objects, as using the word pigs for\r\nsheep, or cows for horses; in this case the association between the idea of\r\nthe animal and the name of it is dissevered; but the idea of the class or\r\ngenus of the thing remains; and he takes a name from the first of the\r\nspecies, which presents itself, and sometimes can correct himself, till he\r\nfinds the true one.\r\n\r\n8. _Tarditas senilis._ Slowness of age. The difficulty of associating ideas\r\nincreases with our age; as may be observed from old people forgetting the\r\nbusiness of the last hour, unless they impress it strongly, or by frequent\r\nrepetition, though they can well recollect the transactions of their youth.\r\nI saw an elderly man, who could reason with great clearness and precision\r\nand in accurate language on subjects, which he had been accustomed to think\r\nupon; and yet did not know, that he had rang the bell by his fire-side in\r\none minute afterwards; nor could then recollect the object he had wanted,\r\nwhen his servant came.\r\n\r\nSimilar to this is the difficulty which old people experience in learning\r\nnew bodily movements, that is, in associating new muscular actions, as in\r\nlearning a new trade or manufactury. The trains of movements, which obey\r\nvolition, are the last which we acquire; and the first, which are\r\ndisassociated.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nORDO II.\r\n\r\n_Decreased Associate Motions._\r\n\r\nGENUS IV.\r\n\r\n_Catenated with External Influences._\r\n\r\nAs the diseases, which obey solar or lunar periods, commence with torpor or\r\ninactivity, such as the cold paroxysms of fevers, the torpor and consequent\r\npain of hemicrania, and the pains which precede the fits of epilepsy and\r\nconvulsion, it would seem, that these diseases are more generally owing to\r\nthe diminution than to the excess of solar or lunar gravitation; as the\r\ndiseases, which originate from the influence of the matter of heat, are\r\nmuch more generally in this country produced by the defect than by the\r\nexcess of that fluid.\r\n\r\nThe periodic returns of so many diseases coincide with the diurnal,\r\nmonthly, and annual rounds of time; that any one, who would deny the\r\ninfluence of the sun and moon on the periods of quotidian, tertian, and\r\nquartan fevers, must deny their effect on the tides, and on the seasons. It\r\nhas generally been believed, that solar and lunar effect was exerted on the\r\nblood; which was thus rendered more or less stimulant to the system, as\r\ndescribed in Sect. XXXII. 6. But as the fluid matter of gravitation\r\npermeates and covers all things, like the fluid matter of heat; I am\r\ninduced to believe, that gravitation acts in its medium state rather as a\r\ncausa sine quâ non of animal motion, like heat; which may disorder the\r\nsystem chemically or mechanically, when it is diminished; but may\r\nnevertheless stimulate it, when increased, into animal exertion.\r\n\r\nWithout heat and motion, which some philosophers still believe to be the\r\nsame thing, as they so perpetually appear together, the particles of matter\r\nwould attract and move towards each other, and the whole universe freeze or\r\ncoalesce into one solid mass. These therefore counteract the gravitation of\r\nbodies to one center; and not only prevent the planets from falling into\r\nthe sun, but become either the efficient causes of vegetable and animal\r\nlife, or the causes without which life cannot exist; as by their means the\r\ncomponent particles of matter are enabled to slide over each other with all\r\nthe various degrees of fluidity and repulsion.\r\n\r\nAs the attraction of the moon countervails or diminishes the terrene\r\ngravitation of bodies on the surface of the earth; a tide rises on that\r\nside of the earth, which is turned towards the moon; and follows it, as the\r\nearth revolves. Another tide is raised at the same time on the opposite\r\nside of the revolving earth; which is owing to the greater centrifugal\r\nmotion of that side of the earth, which counteracts the gravitation of\r\nbodies near its surface. For the earth and moon may be considered as two\r\ncannon balls of different sizes held together by a chain, and revolving\r\nonce a month round a common center of gravity between them, near the\r\nearth's surface; at the same time that they perform their annual orbits\r\nround the sun. Whence the centrifugal force of that side of the earth,\r\nwhich is farthest from this center of motion, round which the earth and\r\nmoon monthly revolve, is considerably greater, than the centrifugal force\r\nof that side of the earth, which is nearest it; to which should be added,\r\nthat this centrifugal force not only contributes to diminish the terrene\r\ngravitation of bodies on the earth's surface on that side furthest from\r\nthis center of motion, but also to increase it on that side, which is\r\nnearest it.\r\n\r\nAnother circumstance, which tends to raise the tide on the part of the\r\nearth's surface, which is most distant from the moon, is, that the\r\nattraction of the moon is less on that part of the ocean, than it is on the\r\nother parts of the earth. Thus the moon may be supposed to attract the\r\nwater on the side of the earth nearest it with a power equal to three; and\r\nto attract the central parts of the earth with a power equal to two; and\r\nthe water on the part of the earth most distant from the moon with a power\r\nonly equal to one. Hence on the side of the earth most distant from the\r\nmoon, the moon's attraction is less, and the centrifugal force round their\r\ncommon center of motion is greater; both which contribute to raise the\r\ntides on that side of the earth. On the side of the earth nearest the moon,\r\nthe moon's attraction is so much greater as to raise the tides; though the\r\ncentrifugal force of the surface of the earth round their common center of\r\nmotion in some degree opposes this effect.\r\n\r\nOn these accounts, when the moon is in the zenith or nadir, the gravitation\r\nof bodies on the earth's surface will be greatest at the two opposite\r\nquadratures; that is, the greatest gravitation of bodies on the earth's\r\nsurface towards her center during the lunar day is about six hours and an\r\nhalf after the southing, or after the northing of the moon.\r\n\r\nCircumstances similar to these, but in a less degree, must occur in respect\r\nto the solar influence on terrestrial bodies; that is, there must be a\r\ndiminution of the gravity of bodies, near the earth's surface at noon, when\r\nthe sun is over them; and also at midnight from the greater centrifugal\r\nforce of that side of the earth, which is most distant from the center,\r\nround which the earth moves in her annual orbit, than on the side nearest\r\nthat center. Whence it likewise follows, that the gravitation of bodies\r\ntowards the earth is greatest about six hours after noon, and after\r\nmidnight.\r\n\r\nNow when the sun and moon have their united gravitation on the same side of\r\nthe earth, as at the new moon; or when the solar attraction coincides with\r\nthe greater centrifugal motion of that side of the earth, which is furthest\r\ndistant from the moon, as at the full moon; and when this happens about\r\nnoon or midnight, the gravitation of terrene bodies towards the earth will\r\nbe greater about six hours after noon, and after midnight, than at any\r\nother part of the lunar period; because the attraction of both these\r\nluminaries is then exerted on those sides of the earth over which they\r\nhang, which at other times of the month are more or less exerted on other\r\nparts of it.\r\n\r\nLastly, as heat and motion counteract the gravitation of the particles of\r\nbodies to each other, and hence become either the efficient causes of\r\nvegetable and animal life, or the causes without which life cannot exist,\r\nit seems to follow, that when our gravitation towards the earth's center is\r\ngreatest, the powers of life should be the least; and hence that those\r\ndiseases, which begin with torpor, should occur about six hours after the\r\nsolar or lunar noon, or about six hours after the solar or lunar midnight;\r\nand this most frequently about six hours after or before the new or full\r\nmoon; and especially when these happen at noon or at midnight; or lastly,\r\naccording to the combination of these powers in diminishing or increasing\r\nthe earth's attraction to bodies on its surface.\r\n\r\nThe returns or exacerbations of many fevers, both irritative and\r\ninflammatory, about six in the evening, and of the periodic cough described\r\nin Sect. XXXVI. 3. 9. countenance this theory. Tables might be made out to\r\nshew the combined powers of the sun and moon in diminishing the gravitation\r\nof bodies on the earth's surface, at every part of their diurnal, monthly,\r\nand annual periods; and which might facilitate the elucidation of this\r\nsubject. But I am well aware of the difficulty of its application to\r\ndiseases, and hope these conjectures may induce others to publish more\r\nnumerous observations, and more conclusive reasonings.\r\n\r\nSPECIES.\r\n\r\n1. _Somni periodus._ The periods of sleeping and of waking are shortened or\r\nprolonged by so many other circumstances in animal life, besides the minute\r\ndifference between diurnal and nocturnal solar gravitation, that it can\r\nscarcely be ascribed to this influence. At the same time it is curious to\r\nobserve, that vegetables in respect to their times of sleeping more\r\nregularly observe the hour of the day, than the presence or absence of\r\nlight, or of heat, as may be seen by consulting the calendar of Flora.\r\nBotanic Garden, Part II. Canto 2. l. 165. note.\r\n\r\nSome diseases, which at first sight might be supposed to be influenced by\r\nsolar periods, seem to be induced by the increasing sensibility of the\r\nsystem to pain during our sleeping hours; as explained in Sect. XVIII. 15.\r\nOf these are the fits of asthma, of some epilepsies, and of some hæmoptoes;\r\nall which disturb the patient after some hours sleep, and are therefore to\r\nbe ascribed to the increase of our dormant sensibility. There may likewise\r\nbe some doubt, whether the commencement of the pain of gout in the foot, as\r\nit generally makes its attack after sleep, should be ascribed to the\r\nincreased sensibility in sleep, or to solar influence?\r\n\r\nM. M. When asthmatic or epileptic fits or hæmoptoe occur after a certain\r\nnumber of hours of sleep, the patient should be forcibly awakened before\r\nthe expected time by an alarm clock, and drink a cup of chocolate or\r\nlemonade.--Or a grain of opium should be given at going to bed.--In one\r\ncase to prevent the too great increase of sensibility by shortening the\r\ntime of sleep; and in the other by increasing the irritative motions, and\r\nexpending by that means a part of the sensorial power.\r\n\r\n2. _Studii inanis periodus._ Class III. 1. 2. 2. The cataleptic spasm which\r\npreceded the reverie and somnambulation in the patient, whose case is\r\nrelated in Sect. XIX. 2. occurred at exactly the same hour, which was about\r\neleven in the morning for many weeks; till those periods were disturbed by\r\nlarge doses of opium; and must therefore be referred to some effect of\r\nsolar gravitation. In the case of Master A. Sect. XXXIV. 3. as the reverie\r\nbegan early in the morning during sleep, there may be a doubt, whether this\r\ncommenced with torpor of some organ catenated with solar gravitation; or\r\nwas caused by the existence of a previous torpid part, which only became so\r\npainful as to excite the exertions of reverie by the perpetual increase of\r\nsensibility during the continuance of sleep, as in some fits of epilepsy,\r\nasthma, and hæmoptoe mentioned in the preceding article.\r\n\r\n3. _Hemicraniæ periodus._ Periods of hemicrania. Class IV. 2. 2. 8. The\r\ntorpor and consequent pain of some membranes on one side of the head, as\r\nover one eye, is frequently occasioned by a decaying tooth, and is liable\r\nto return every day, or on alternate days at solar or lunar periods. In\r\nthis case large quantities of the bark will frequently cure the disease,\r\nand especially if preceded by venesection and a brisk cathartic; but if the\r\noffending tooth can be detected, the most certain cure is its extraction.\r\nThese partial head-achs are also liable to return at the greater lunar\r\nperiods, as about once a month. Five drops from a two-ounce phial of a\r\nsaturated solution of arsenic twice a day for a week or two have been said\r\nto prevent the returns of this disease. See a Treatise on Arsenic by Dr.\r\nFowler, of York. Strong errhines have also been recommended.\r\n\r\n4. _Epilepsiæ dolorificæ periodus._ Class III. 1. 1. 8. The pain which\r\ninduces after about an hour the violent convulsions or insanity, which\r\nconstitute the painful epilepsy, generally observe solar diurnal periods\r\nfor four or five weeks, and are probably governed by solar and lunar times\r\nin respect to their greater periods; for I have observed that the daily\r\nparoxysms, unless disturbed by large doses of opium, recur at very nearly\r\nthe same hour, and after a few weeks the patients have recovered to relapse\r\nagain at the interval of a few months. But more observations are wanted\r\nupon this subject, which might be of great advantage in preventing the\r\nattacks of this disease; as much less opium given an hour before its\r\nexpected daily return will prevent the paroxysm, than is necessary to cure\r\nit, after it has commenced.\r\n\r\n5. _Convulsionis dolorificæ periodus._ Class III. 1. 1. 6. The pains, which\r\nproduce these convulsions, are generally left after rheumatism, and come on\r\nwhen the patients are become warm in bed, or have been for a short time\r\nasleep, and are therefore perhaps rather to be ascribed to the increasing\r\nsensibility of the system during sleep, than to solar diurnal periods, as\r\nin Species first and second of this Genus.\r\n\r\n6. _Tussis periodicæ periodus._ Periodic cough, Class IV. 2. 1. 9. returns\r\nat exact solar periods; that described in Sect. XXXVI. 3. 9. recurred about\r\nseven in the afternoon for several weeks, till its periods were disturbed\r\nby opium, and then it recurred at eleven at night for about a week, and was\r\nthen totally destroyed by opium given in very large quantities, after\r\nhaving been previously for a few days omitted.\r\n\r\n7. _Catameniæ periodus._ Periods of menstruation. The correspondence of the\r\nperiods of the catamenia with those of the moon was treated of in Sect.\r\nXXXII. 6. and can admit of no more doubt, than that the returns of the\r\ntides are governed by lunar influence. But the manner in which this is\r\nproduced, is less evident; it has commonly been ascribed to some effect of\r\nthe lunar gravitation on the circulating blood, as mentioned in Sect.\r\nXXXII. 6. But it is more analogous to other animal phenomena to suppose\r\nthat the lunar gravitation immediately affects the solids by its influx or\r\nstimulus. Which we believe of the fluid element of heat, in which we are\r\nequally immersed; and of the electric fluid, which also surrounds and\r\npervades us. See Sect. XXXVI. 2. 3.\r\n\r\nIf the torpor of the uterine veins, which induces the monthly periods of\r\nthe catamenia, be governed by the increase of terrene gravitation; that is,\r\nby the deficiency of the counter-influence of solar and lunar gravitation;\r\nwhy does not it occur most frequently when the terrene gravitation is the\r\ngreatest, as about six hours after the new moon, and next to that at about\r\nsix hours after the full moon? This question has its difficulty; first, if\r\nthe terrene gravitation be greatest about six hours after the new moon, it\r\nmust become less and less about the same time every lunar day, till the end\r\nof the first quarter, when it will be the least; it must then increase\r\ndaily till the full. After the full the terrene gravitation must again\r\ndecrease till the end of the third quarter, when it will again be the\r\nleast, and must increase again till the new moon; that is, the solar and\r\nlunar counter-gravitation is greatest, when those luminaries are vertical,\r\nat the new moon, and full moon, and least about six hours afterwards. If it\r\nwas known, whether more menstruations occur about six hours after the moon\r\nis in the zenith or nadir; and in the second and fourth quarters of the\r\nmoon, than in the first and third; some light would be thrown on this\r\nsubject; which must in that respect wait for future observations.\r\n\r\nSecondly, if the lunar influence produces a very small degree of\r\nquiescence, suppose of the uterine veins, at first; and if that recurs at\r\ncertain periods, as of lunar days, or about 25 hours, even with less power\r\nto produce quiescence than at first; yet the quiescence will daily increase\r\nby the acquired habit acting at the same time, as explained in Sect. XII.\r\n3. 3. till at length so great a degree of quiescence will be induced as to\r\ncause the inaction of the veins of the uterus, and consequent venous\r\nhæmorrhage. See Sect. XXXII. 6. Class I. 2. 1. 11. IV. 1. 4. 4. See the\r\nintroduction to this Genus.\r\n\r\n8. _Hæmorrhoidis periodus._ The periods of the piles depend on the torpor\r\nof the veins of the rectum, and are believed to recur nearly at monthly\r\nintervals. See Sect. XXVII. 2. and Class I. 2. 1. 6.\r\n\r\n9. _Podagræ periodus._ The periods of gout in some patients recur at annual\r\nintervals, as in the case related above in Class IV. 1. 2. 15. in which the\r\ngouty paroxysm returned for three successive years on nearly the same day\r\nof the month. The commencement of the pain of each paroxysm is generally a\r\nfew hours after midnight, and may thence either be induced by diurnal solar\r\nperiods, or by the increasing sensibility during sleep, as mentioned in the\r\nfirst species of this genus.\r\n\r\n10. _Erysipelatis periodus._ Some kinds of erysipelas which probably\r\noriginate from the association of the cutaneous vessels with a diseased\r\nliver, occur at monthly periods, like the hæmorrhois or piles; and others\r\nat annual periods like the gout; as a torpor of some part I suppose always\r\nprecedes the erysipelatous inflammation, the periods should accord with the\r\nincreasing influence of terrene gravitation, as described in the\r\nintroduction to this Genus, and in Species the seventh of it. Other periods\r\nof diseases referable to solar and lunar influence are mentioned in Sect\r\nXXXVI. and many others will probably be discovered by future observation.\r\n\r\n11. _Febrium periodus._ Periods of fevers. The commencement of the cold\r\nfits of intermittent fevers, and the daily exacerbations of other fevers,\r\nso regularly recur at diurnal solar or lunar periods, that it is impossible\r\nto deny their connection with gravitation; as explained in Sect. XXXVI. 3.\r\nNot only these exacerbations of fever, and their remissions, obey the\r\ndiurnal solar and lunar periods; but the preparatory circumstances, which\r\nintroduce fevers, or which determine their crisises, appear to be governed\r\nby the parts of monthly lunar periods, and of solar annual ones. Thus the\r\nvariolous fever in the natural small-pox commences on the 14th day, and in\r\nthe inoculated small-pox on the seventh day. The fever and eruption in the\r\ndistinct kind take up another quarter of a lunation, and the maturation\r\nanother quarter.\r\n\r\nThe fever, which is termed canine madness, or hydrophobia, is believed to\r\ncommence near the new or full moon; and, if the cause is not then great\r\nenough to bring on the disease, it seems to acquire some strength, or to\r\nlie dormant, till another, or perhaps more powerful lunation calls it into\r\naction. In the spring, about three or four years ago, a mad dog very much\r\nworried one swine confined in a sty, and bit another in the same sty in a\r\nless degree; the former became mad, refused his meat, was much convulsed,\r\nand died in about four days; this disease commenced about a month after the\r\nbite. The other swine began to be ill about a month after the first, and\r\ndied in the same manner.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nORDO III.\r\n\r\n_Retrograde Associate Motions._\r\n\r\nGENUS I.\r\n\r\n_Catenated with Irritative Motions._\r\n\r\nThose retrograde associate motions, the first links of which are catenated\r\nwith irritative motions, belong to this genus. All the retrograde motions\r\nare consequent to debility, or inactivity, of the organ; and therefore\r\nproperly belong to the genera of decreased actions both in this and the\r\nformer classes.\r\n\r\nSPECIES.\r\n\r\n1. _Diabætes irritata._ When the absorbents of the intestines are\r\nstimulated too strongly by spirit of wine, as in the beginning of\r\ndrunkenness, the urinary absorbents invert their motions. The same happens\r\nfrom worms in the intestines. In other kinds of diabetes may not the remote\r\ncause be the too strong action of the cutaneous absorbents, or of the\r\npulmonary ones? May not in such cases oil externally or internally be of\r\nservice? or warm bathing for an hour at a time? In hysteric inversions of\r\nmotion is some other part too much stimulated? or pained from the want of\r\nstimulus?\r\n\r\n2. _Sudor frigidus in asthmate._ The cause of the paroxysms of humoral\r\nasthma is not well understood; I suppose it to be owing to a torpidity or\r\ninaction of the absorbents belonging to the pulmonary vessels, as happens\r\nprobably to other viscera at the commencement of intermittent fevers, and\r\nto a consequent accumulation of fluids in them; which at length producing\r\ngreat irritation or uneasy sensation causes the violent efforts to produce\r\nthe absorption of it. The motions of the cutaneous absorbent vessels by\r\ntheir association with those of the pulmonary ones become retrograde, and\r\neffuse upon the skin a fluid, which is said to be viscid, and which adheres\r\nin drops.\r\n\r\nA few days ago I saw a young man of delicate constitution in what was\r\ncalled a fit of the asthma; he had about two months before had a\r\nperipneumony, and had been ever since subject to difficult respiration on\r\nexertion, with occasional palpitation of his heart. He was now seized about\r\neight at night after some exertion of mind in his business with cold\r\nextremities, and difficulty of breathing. He gradually became worse, and in\r\nabout half an hour, the palpitation of his heart and difficult respiration\r\nwere very alarming; his whole skin was cold and pale, yet he did not\r\nshudder as in cold paroxysm of fever; his tongue from the point to the\r\nmiddle became as cold as his other extremities, with cold breath. He seemed\r\nto be in the act of dying, except that his pulse continued equal in time,\r\nthough very quick. He lost three ounces of blood, and took ten drops of\r\nlaudanum with musk and salt of hartshorn, and recovered in an hour or two\r\nwithout any cold sweat.\r\n\r\nThere being no cold sweat seems to indicate, that there was no accumulation\r\nof serous fluid in the lungs; and that their inactivity, and the coldness\r\nof the breath, was owing to the sympathy of the air-cells with some distant\r\npart. There was no shuddering produced, because the lungs are not sensible\r\nto heat and cold; as any one may observe by going from a warm room into a\r\nfrosty air, and the contrary. So the steam of hot tea, which scalds the\r\nmouth, does not affect the lungs with the sensation of heat. I was induced\r\nto believe, that the whole cold fit might be owing to suppuration in some\r\npart of the chest; as the general difficulty of breathing seemed to be\r\nincreased after a few days with pulse of 120, and other signs of empyema.\r\nDoes the cold sweat, and the occurrence of the fits of asthma after sleep,\r\ndistinguish the humoral asthma from the cold paroxysm of intermittents, or\r\nwhich attends suppuration, or which precedes inflammation?--I heard a few\r\nweeks afterwards, that he spit up much matter at the time he died.\r\n\r\n3. _Diabætes a timore._ The motions of the absorbent vessels of the neck of\r\nthe bladder become inverted by their consent with those of the skin; which\r\nare become torpid by their reverse sympathy with the painful ideas of fear,\r\nas in Sect. XVI. 8. 1. whence there is a great discharge of pale urine, as\r\nin hysteric diseases.\r\n\r\nThe same happens from anxiety, where the painful suspense is continued,\r\neven when the degree of fear is small; as in young men about to be examined\r\nfor a degree at the universities the frequency of making water is very\r\nobservable. When this anxiety is attended with a sleepless night, the\r\nquantity of pale urine is amazingly great in some people, and the\r\nmicturition very frequent.\r\n\r\nM. M. Opium. Joy. Consolations of friendship.\r\n\r\n4. _Diarrhoea a timore._ The absorbent vessels of the intestines invert\r\ntheir motions by direct consent with the skin; hence many liquid stools as\r\nwell as much pale urine are liable to accompany continued fear, along with\r\ncoldness of the skin. The immediate cause of this is the decreased\r\nsensorial power of association, which intervenes between the actions of the\r\nabsorbents of the cold skin, and those of the intestinal absorbents; the\r\nmotions of the latter become on that account weakened and at length\r\nretrograde. The remote cause is the torpor of the vessels of the skin\r\ncatenated with the pain of fear, as explained in Sect. XVI. 8. 1.\r\n\r\nThe capillaries of the skin consent more generally by direct sympathy with\r\nthose of the lower intestines, and of the bladder; but by reverse sympathy\r\nmore generally with those of the stomach and upper intestines. As appears\r\nin fevers, where the hot skin accompanies indigestion of the stomach; and\r\nin diarrhoeas attended with cold extremities.\r\n\r\nThe remote cause is the torpor of the skin owing to its reverse sympathy\r\nwith the painful sensual motions, or ideas, of fear; which are now actuated\r\nwith great energy, so as to deprive the second link of associated motions\r\nof their due share of sensorial power. It is also probable, that the pain\r\nof fear itself may contribute to exhaust the sensorial power, even when it\r\nproduces no muscular action. See Class IV. 2. 2.\r\n\r\n5. _Pallor et tremor a timore._ A retrograde action of the capillaries of\r\nthe skin producing paleness, and a torpor of the muscular fibres of the\r\nlimbs occasioning trembling, are caused by their reverse associations with\r\nthe ideas or imaginations of fear; which are now actuated with violent\r\nenergy, and accompanied with great pain. The cause of these associations\r\nare explained in Sect XVI. 8. 1.\r\n\r\nThese torpid actions of the capillaries and muscles of the limbs are not\r\ncaused immediately by the painful sensation of fear; as in that case they\r\nwould have been increased and not decreased actions, as occurs in anger;\r\nwhere the painful volition increases the actions of the capillaries,\r\nexciting a blush and heat of the skin. Whence we may gain some knowledge of\r\nwhat is meant by depressing and exciting passions; the former confiding of\r\nideas attended with pain, which pain occasions no muscular actions, like\r\nthe pain of cold head-ach; the latter being attended with volitions, and\r\nconsequent muscular exertions.\r\n\r\nThat is, the pain of fear, and the pain of anger, are produced by the\r\nexertion of certain ideas, or motions of certain nerves of sense; in the\r\nformer case, the painful sensation of fear produces no muscular actions,\r\nyet it exhausts or employs so much sensorial power, that the whole system\r\nacts more feebly, or becomes retrograde; but some parts of it more so than\r\nothers, according to their early associations described in Sect. XVI. 8. 1.\r\nhence the tremor of the limbs, palpitation of heart, and even syncope. In\r\nanger the painful volition produces violent muscular actions; but if\r\nprevious to these any deliberation occurs, a flushed countenance sometimes,\r\nand a red skin, are produced by this superabundance of volition exerted on\r\nthe arterial system; but at other times the skin becomes pale, and the legs\r\ntremble, from the exhaustion or expenditure of the sensorial power by the\r\npainful volitions of anger on the organs of sense, as by the painful\r\nsensations of fear above mentioned.\r\n\r\nWhere the passion of fear exists in a great degree, it exhausts or expends\r\nso much sensorial power, either simply by the pain which attends it, or by\r\nthe violent and perpetual excitement of the terrific imaginations or ideas,\r\nthat not only a cold and pale skin, but a retrograde motion of the\r\ncutaneous absorbents occurs, and a cold sweat appears upon the whole\r\nsurface of the body, which probably sometimes increases pulmonary\r\nabsorption; as in Class II. 1. 6. 4. and as in the cold sweats, which\r\nattend the paroxysms of humoral asthma. Hence anxiety, which is a continued\r\npain of fear, so universally debilitates the constitution as to occasion a\r\nlingering death; which happens much more frequently than is usually\r\nsupposed; and these victims of continued anxiety are said to die of a\r\nbroken heart. Other kinds of paleness are described in Class I. 2. 2. 2.\r\n\r\nM. M. Opium. Wine. Food. Joy.\r\n\r\n6. _Palpitatio cordis a timore._ The palpitation of the heart from fear is\r\nowing to the weak action of it, and perhaps sometimes to the retrograde\r\nexertion of the ventricules and auricles; because it seems to be affected\r\nby its association with the capillaries, the actions of which, with those\r\nof the arteries and veins, constitute one great circle of associate\r\nmotions. Now when the capillaries of the skin become torpid, coldness and\r\npaleness succeed; and with these are associated the capillaries of the\r\nlungs, whence difficult respiration; and with these the weak and retrograde\r\nactions of the heart. At the same time the absorbents of the skin, and of\r\nthe bladder, and of the intestines, sometimes become retrograde, and\r\nregurgitate their contents; as appears by the pale urine in large\r\nquantities, which attends hysteric complaints along with this palpitation\r\nof the heart; and from the cold sweats, and diarrhoea; all which, as well\r\nas the hysteric complaints, are liable to be induced or attended by fear.\r\n\r\nWhen fear has still more violently affected the system, there have been\r\ninstances where syncope, and sudden death, or a total stoppage of the\r\ncirculation, have succeeded: in these last cases, the pain of fear has\r\nemployed or exhausted the whole of the sensorial power, so that not only\r\nthose muscular fibres generally exerted by volition cease to act, whence\r\nthe patient falls down; and those, which constitute the organs of sense,\r\nwhence syncope; but lastly those, which perform the vital motions, become\r\ndeprived of sensorial power, and death ensues. See Class. I. 2. 1. 4. and\r\nI. 2. 1. 10. Similar to this in some epileptic fits the patient first\r\nsuddenly falls down, without even endeavouring to save himself by his hands\r\nbefore the convulsive motions come on. In this case the great exertion of\r\nsome small part in consequence of great irritation or sensation exhausts\r\nthe whole sensorial power, which was lodged in the extremities of the\r\nlocomotive nerves, for a short time, as in syncope; and as soon as these\r\nmuscles are again supplied, convulsions supervene to relieve the painful\r\nsensation. See Class III. 1. 1. 7.\r\n\r\n7. _Abortio a timore._ Women miscarry much more frequently from a fright,\r\nthan from bodily injury. A torpor or retrograde motion of the capillary\r\narteries of the internal uterus is probably the immediate cause of these\r\nmiscarriages, owing to the association of the actions of those vessels with\r\nthe capillaries of the skin, which are rendered torpid or retrograde by\r\nfear. By this contraction of the uterine arteries, the fine vessels of the\r\nplacenta, which are inserted into them, are detruded, or otherwise so\r\naffected, that the placenta separates at this time from the uterus, and the\r\nfetus dies from want of oxygenation. A strong young woman, in the fifth or\r\nsixth month of her pregnancy, who has since borne many children, went into\r\nher cellar to draw beer; one of the servant boys was hid behind a barrel,\r\nand started out to surprise her, believing her to be the maid-servant; she\r\nbegan to flood immediately, and miscarried in a few hours. See Sect. XXXIX.\r\n6. 5. and Class I. 2. 1. 14.\r\n\r\n8. _Hysteria a timore._ Some delicate ladies are liable to fall into\r\nhysteric fits from sudden fright. The peristaltic motions of the bowels and\r\nstomach, and those of the oesophagus, make a part of the great circle of\r\nirritative motions with those of the skin, and many other membranes. Hence\r\nwhen the cutaneous vessels become torpid from their reverse sympathy with\r\nthe painful ideas of fear; these of the bowels, and stomach, and\r\noesophagus, become first torpid by direct sympathy with those of the skin,\r\nand then feebly and ineffectually invert the order of their motions, which\r\nconstitutes a paroxysm of the hysteric disease. See Class I. 3. 1. 10.\r\nThese hysteric paroxysms are sometimes followed by convulsions, which\r\nbelong to Class III. as they are exertions to relieve pain; and sometimes\r\nby death. See Species 9 of this Genus, and Class I. 2. 1. 4.\r\n\r\nIndigestion from fear is to be ascribed in the same manner to the torpor of\r\nthe stomach, owing to its association with the skin.

So much sensorial power is employed for a time on the\r\ndisgustful idea, or expended in the production of inactive pain, which\r\nattends it, that the other parts of the associated chain of action, of\r\nwhich this disgustful idea is now become a link, is deprived of their\r\naccustomed share; and therefore first stop, and then invert their motions.\r\nOwing to deficiency of sensorial power, as explained more at large in Sect.\r\nXXXV. 1. 3.\r\n\r\n2. _Nausea a conceptu._ The nausea, which pregnant women are so subject to\r\nduring the first part of gestation, is owing to the reverse sympathy\r\nbetween the uterus and stomach, so that the increased action of the former,\r\nexcited by the stimulus of the growing embryon, which I believe is\r\nsometimes attended with sensation, produces decreased actions of the latter\r\nwith the disagreeable sensation of sickness with indigestion and consequent\r\nacidity. When the fetus acquires so much muscular power as to move its\r\nlimbs, or to turn itself, which is called quickening, this sickness of\r\npregnancy generally ceases.\r\n\r\nM. M. Calcined magnesia. Rhubarb. Half a grain of opium twice a day.\r\nRecumbent posture on a sofa.\r\n\r\n3. _Vomitio vertiginosa._ Sea-sickness, the irritative motions of vision,\r\nby which we balance ourselves, and preserve our perpendicularity, are\r\ndisturbed by the indistinctness of their objects; which is either owing to\r\nthe similarity of them, or to their distance, or to their apparent or\r\nunusual motions. Hence these irritative motions of vision are exerted with\r\ngreater energy, and are in consequence attended with sensation; which, at\r\nfirst is agreeable, as when children swing on a rope; afterwards the\r\nirritative motions of the stomach, and of the absorbent vessels, which open\r\ntheir mouths into it, become inverted by their associations with them by\r\nreverse sympathy.\r\n\r\nFor the action of vomiting, as well as the disagreeable sensation of\r\nsickness, are shewn to be occasioned by defect of the sensorial power;\r\nwhich in this case is owing to the greater expenditure of it by the sense\r\nof vision. On the same account the vomiting, which attends the passage of a\r\nstone through the ureter, or from an inflammation of the bowels, or in the\r\ncommencement of some fevers, is caused by the increased expenditure of the\r\nsensorial power by the too great action of some links of the associations\r\nof irritative motions; and there being in consequence a deficiency of the\r\nquantity required for other links of this great catenation.\r\n\r\nIt must be observed, that the expenditure of sensorial power by the retinas\r\nof the eyes is very great; which may be estimated by the perpetual use of\r\nthose organs during our waking hours, and during most of our sleeping ones;\r\nand by the large diameters of the two optic nerves, which are nearly the\r\nsize of a quill, or equal to some of the principal nerves, which serve the\r\nlimbs.\r\n\r\n4. _Vomitio a calculo in uretere._ The action of vomiting in consequence of\r\nthe increased or decreased actions of the ureter, when a stone lodges in\r\nit. The natural actions of the stomach, which consist of motions subject to\r\nintermitted irritations from the fluids, which pass through it, are\r\nassociated with those of the ureter; and become torpid, and consequently\r\nretrograde, by intervals, when the actions of the ureter becomes torpid\r\nowing to previous great stimulus from the stone it contains; as appears\r\nfrom the vomiting existing when the pain is least. When the motions of the\r\nureter are thus lessened, the sensorial power of association, which ought\r\nto actuate the stomach along with the sensorial power of irritation, ceases\r\nto be excited into action; and in consequence the actions of the stomach\r\nbecome less energetic, and in consequence retrograde.\r\n\r\nFor as vomiting is a decreased action of the stomach, as explained in Sect.\r\nXXXV. 1. 3. it cannot be supposed to be produced by the pain of gravel in\r\nthe ureter alone, as it should then be an increased action, not a decreased\r\none.\r\n\r\nThe perpetual vomiting in ileus is caused in like manner by the defective\r\nexcitement of the sensorial power of association by the bowel, which is\r\ntorpid during the intervals of pain; and the stomach sympathizes with it.\r\nSee Enteritis, Class II. 1. 2. 11. Does this symptom of vomiting indicate,\r\nwhether the disease be above or below the valve of the colon? Does not the\r\nsofter pulse in some kinds of enteritis depend on the sympathy of the heart\r\nand arteries with the sickness of the stomach? See Ileus and Cholera.\r\n\r\nHence this sickness, as well as the sickness in some fevers, cannot be\r\nesteemed an effort of nature to dislodge any offensive material; but like\r\nthe sea-sickness described above, and in Sect. XX. 4. is the consequence of\r\nthe associations of irritative or sensitive motions. See Class I. 1. 3. 9.\r\n\r\n5. _Vomitio ab insultu paralytico._ Paralytic affections generally commence\r\nwith vomiting, the same frequently happens from a violent blow with a stick\r\non the head; this curious connection of the brain and stomach has not been\r\nexplained; as it resembles the sickness in consequence of vertigo at sea,\r\nit would seem to arise from a similar cause, viz. from disturbed irritative\r\nor sensitive associations.\r\n\r\n6. _Vomitio a titillatione faucium._ If the throat be slightly tickled with\r\na feather, a nausea is produced, that is, an inverted action of the mouths\r\nof the lymphatics of the fauces, and by direct sympathy an inverted action\r\nof the stomach ensues. As these parts have frequently been stimulated at\r\nthe same time into pleasurable action by the deglutition of our daily\r\naliment, their actions become strongly associated. And as all the food, we\r\nswallow, is either moist originally, or mixed with our moist saliva in the\r\nmouth; a feather, which is originally dry, and which in some measure repels\r\nthe moist saliva, is disagreeable to the touch of the fauces; at the same\r\ntime this nausea and vomiting cannot be caused by the disagreeable\r\nsensation simply, as then they ought to have been increased exertions, and\r\nnot decreased ones, as shewn in Section XXXV. 1. 3. But the mouths of the\r\nlymphatics of the fauces are stimulated by the dry feather into too great\r\naction for a time, and become retrograde afterwards by the debility\r\nconsequent to too great previous stimulus.\r\n\r\n7. _Vomitio cute sympathetica._ Vomiting is successfully stopped by the\r\napplication of a blister on the back in some fevers, where the extremities\r\nare cold, and the skin pale. It was stopped by Sydenham by producing a\r\nsweat on the skin by covering the head with the bed-clothes. See Class IV.\r\n1. 1. 3. and Suppl.

Some human subjects have been\r\nsaid to have obtained this power of voluntary action over the retrograde\r\nmotions of the stomach and oesophagus, and thus to have been able to empty\r\ntheir stomach at pleasure. See Sect. XXV. 6. This voluntary act of emptying\r\nthe stomach is possessed by some birds, as the pigeon; who has an organ for\r\nsecreting milk in its stomach, as Mr. Hunter observed; and softens the food\r\nfor its young by previously swallowing it; and afterwards putting its bill\r\ninto theirs returns it into their mouths. See Sect. XXXIX. 4. 8. The\r\npelicans use a stomach, or throat bag, for the purpose of bringing the\r\nfish, which they catch in the sea to shore, and then eject them, and eat\r\nthem at their leisure. See Sect. XVI. 11. And I am well informed of a\r\nbitch, who having puppies in a stable at a distance from the house,\r\nswallowed the flesh-meat, which was given her, in large pieces, and\r\ncarrying it immediately to her whelps, brought it up out of her stomach,\r\nand laid it down before them.\r\n\r\n3. _Eructatio voluntaria._ Voluntary eructation. Some, who have weak\r\ndigestions, and thence have frequently been induced to eruct the quantity\r\nof air discharged from the fermenting aliment in their stomachs, have\r\ngradually obtained a power of voluntary eructation, and have been able thus\r\nto bring up hogsheads of air from their stomachs, whenever they pleased.\r\nThis great quantity of air is to be ascribed to the increase of the\r\nfermentation of the aliment by drawing off the gas as soon as it is\r\nproduced.

IV.\r\n\r\n_Catenated with External Influences._\r\n\r\nSPECIES.\r\n\r\n1. _Catarrhus periodicus._ Periodical catarrh is not a very uncommon\r\ndisease; there is a great discharge of a thin saline mucous material from\r\nthe membranes of the nostrils, and probably from the maxillary and frontal\r\nsinuses, which recur once a day at exact solar periods; unless it be\r\ndisturbed by the exhibition of opium; and resembles the periodic cough\r\nmentioned below. See Class I. 3. 2. 1. It is probably owing to the\r\nretrograde action of the lymphatics of the membranes affected, and produced\r\nimmediately by solar influence.\r\n\r\n2. _Tussis periodica._ Periodic cough, called nervous cough, and tussis\r\nserina. It seems to arise from a periodic retrograde action of the\r\nlymphatics of the membrane, which lines the air-cells of the lungs. And the\r\naction of coughing, which is violently for an hour or longer, is probably\r\nexcited by the stimulus of the thin fluid thus produced, as well as by the\r\ndisagreeable sensation attending membranous inactivity; and resembles\r\nperiodic catarrh not only in its situation on a mucous membrane, but in the\r\ndischarge of a thin fluid. As it is partly restrainable, it does not come\r\nunder the name of convulsion; and as it is not attended with difficult\r\nrespiration, it cannot be called asthma; it is cured by very large doses of\r\nopium, see a case and cure in Sect. XXXVI. 3. 9. see Class IV. 2. 4. 6. and\r\nseems immediately to be induced by solar influence.\r\n\r\n3. _Histeria a frigore._ Hysteric paroxysms are occasioned by whatever\r\nsuddenly debilitates the system, as fear, or cold, and perhaps sometimes by\r\nexternal moisture of the air, as all delicate people have their days of\r\ngreater or less debility, see Class IV. 3. 1. 8.\r\n\r\n4. _Nausea pluvialis._ Sickness at the commencement of a rainy season is\r\nvery common among dogs, who assist themselves by eating the agrostris\r\ncanina, or dog's grass, and thus empty their stomachs. The same occurs with\r\nless frequency to cats, who make use of the same expedient. See Sect. XVI.\r\n11. I have known one person, who from his early years has always been sick\r\nat the beginning of wet weather, and still continues so. Is this owing to a\r\nsympathy of the mucous membrane of the stomach with the mechanical\r\nrelaxation of the external cuticle by a moister atmosphere, as is seen in\r\nthe corrugated cuticle of the hands of washing-women? or does it sympathize\r\nwith the mucous membrane of the lungs, which must be affected along with\r\nthe mucus on its surface by the respiration of a moister atmosphere?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPPLEMENT TO CLASS IV.\r\n\r\n_Sympathetic Theory of Fever._\r\n\r\nAs fever consists in the increase or diminution of direct or reverse\r\nassociated motions, whatever may have been the remote cause of them, it\r\nproperly belongs to the fourth class of diseases; and is introduced at the\r\nend of the class, that its great difficulties might receive elucidation\r\nfrom the preceding parts of it. These I shall endeavour to enumerate under\r\nthe following heads, trusting that the candid reader will discover in these\r\nrudiments of the theory of fever a nascent embryon, an infant Hercules,\r\nwhich Time may rear to maturity, and render serviceable to mankind.\r\n\r\n     I.

When a small part of the cutaneous capillaries with their mucous or\r\nperspirative glands are for a short time exposed to a colder medium, as\r\nwhen the hands are immersed in iced water for a minute, these capillary\r\nvessels and their glands become torpid or quiescent, owing to the eduction\r\nof the stimulus of heat. The skin then becomes pale, because no blood\r\npasses through the external capillaries; and appears shrunk, because their\r\nsides are collapsed from inactivity, not contracted by spasm; the roots of\r\nthe hair are left prominent from the seceding or subsiding of the skin\r\naround them; and the pain of coldness is produced.\r\n\r\nIn this situation, if the usual degree of warmth be applied, these vessels\r\nregain their activity; and having now become more irritable from an\r\naccumulation of the sensorial power of irritation during their quiescence,\r\na greater exertion of them follows, with an increased glow of the skin, and\r\nanother kind of pain, which is called the hot-ach; but no fever, properly\r\nso called, is yet produced; as this effect is not universal, nor permanent,\r\nnor recurrent.\r\n\r\n2. If a greater part of the cutaneous capillaries with their mucous and\r\nperspirative glands be exposed for a longer time to cold, the torpor or\r\nquiescence becomes extended by direct sympathy to the heart and arteries;\r\nwhich is known by the weakness, and consequent frequency of the pulse in\r\ncold fits of fever.\r\n\r\nThis requires to be further explained. The movements of the heart and\r\narteries, and the whole of the circulatory vessels, are in general excited\r\ninto action by the two sensorial powers of irritation, and of association.\r\nThe former is excited by stimulus, the latter by the previous actions of a\r\npart of the vital circle of motions. In the above situation the capillaries\r\nact weakly from defect of irritation, which is caused by deficient stimulus\r\nof heat; but the heart and arteries act weakly from defect of association,\r\nwhich is owing to the weak action of the capillaries; which does not now\r\nexcite the sensorial power of association into action with sufficient\r\nenergy.\r\n\r\nAfter a time, either by the application of warmth, or by the increase of\r\ntheir irritability owing to the accumulation of the sensorial power of\r\nirritation during their previous quiescence, the capillary vessels and\r\nglands act with greater energy than natural; whence the red colour and heat\r\nof the skin. The heart and arteries acquire a greater strength of\r\npulsation, and continue the frequency of it, owing to the accumulation of\r\nthe sensorial power of association during their previous torpor, and their\r\nconsequent greater associability; which is now also more strongly excited\r\nby the increased actions of the capillaries. And thus a fit of simple fever\r\nis produced, which is termed Febris irritativa; and consists of a torpor of\r\nthe cutaneous capillaries with their mucous and perspirative glands,\r\naccompanied with a torpor of the heart and arteries; and afterwards of an\r\nincreased action of all these vessels, by what is termed direct sympathy.\r\n\r\nThis fever, with strong pulse without inflammation, or febris irritativa,\r\ndescribed in Class I. 1. 1. 1. is frequently seen in vernal intermittents,\r\nas the orgasm of the heart and arteries is then occasioned by their\r\nprevious state of torpor; but more rarely I believe exists in the type of\r\ncontinued fever, except there be an evident remission, or approximation to\r\na cold fit; at which time a new accumulation of the sensorial power of\r\nassociation is produced; which afterwards actuates the heart and arteries\r\nwith unnatural vigour; or unless there be some stimulus perpetually acting\r\non the system so as to induce an increased secretion of sensorial power in\r\nthe brain, as occurs in slight degrees of intoxication. Since without one\r\nor other of these circumstances in continued fevers without inflammation,\r\nthat is, without the additional sensorial power of sensation being\r\nintroduced, it seems difficult to account for the production of so great a\r\nquantity of sensorial power, as must be necessary to give perpetual\r\nincrease of action to the whole sanguiferous system.\r\n\r\n3. On the contrary, while the cutaneous capillaries with their mucous and\r\nperspirative glands acquire an increased irritability, as above, by the\r\naccumulation of that sensorial power during their previous quiescence, and\r\nthus constitute the hot fit of fever; if the heart and arteries do not\r\nacquire any increase of associability, but continue in their state of\r\ntorpor, another kind of simple fever is produced; which is generally of the\r\ncontinued kind, and is termed Febris inirritativa; which consists of a\r\nprevious torpor of the capillaries of the skin, and of the heart and\r\narteries by direct sympathy with them; and afterwards of an orgasm or\r\nincreased action of the capillaries of the skin, with a decreased action,\r\nor continued torpor, of the heart and arteries by reverse sympathy with\r\nthem. This orgasm of the cutaneous capillaries, which appears by the blush\r\nand heat of the skin, is at first owing to the accumulation of the\r\nsensorial power of irritation during their previous torpid state, as in the\r\nfebris irritata above described; but which is afterwards supported or\r\ncontinued by the reverse sympathy of these capillaries with the torpid\r\nstate of the heart and arteries, as will be further explained in article 8\r\nof this Supplement.\r\n\r\n4. The renovated activity of the capillaries commences as soon or sooner\r\nthan that of the heart and arteries after the cold fit of irritative fever;\r\nand is not owing to their being forced open by the blood being impelled\r\ninto them mechanically, by the renovated action of the heart and arteries;\r\nfor these capillaries of the skin have greater mobility than the heart and\r\narteries, as appears in the sudden blush of shame; which may be owing to\r\ntheir being more liable to perpetual varieties of activity from their\r\nexposure to the vicissitudes of atmospheric heat. And because in\r\ninirritative fevers, or those with arterial debility, the capillaries\r\nacquire increased strength, as is evinced by the heat of the skin, while\r\nthe pulsations of the heart and arteries remain feeble.\r\n\r\n5. It was said above, that the cutaneous capillaries, when they were\r\nrendered torpid by exposure to cold, either recovered their activity by the\r\nreapplication of external warmth; or by their increased irritability, which\r\nis caused by the accumulation of that sensorial power during their\r\nquiescence. An example of the former of these may be seen on emerging from\r\na very cold bath; which produces a fit of simple fever; the cold fit, and\r\nconsequent hot fit, of which may be prolonged by continuing in the bath;\r\nwhich has indeed proved fatal to some weak and delicate people, and to\r\nothers after having been much exhausted by heat and exercise. See Sect.\r\nXXXII. 3. 2. An example of the latter may be taken from going into a bath\r\nof about eighty degrees of heat, as into the bath at Buxton, where the\r\nbather first feels a chill, and after a minute becomes warm, though he\r\nremains in the same medium, owing to the increase of irritability from the\r\naccumulation of that sensorial power during the short time, which the\r\nchilness continued.\r\n\r\n6. Hence simple fevers are of two kinds; first, the febris irritativa, or\r\nfever with strong pulse; which consists of a previous torpor of the heart,\r\narteries, and capillaries, and a succeeding orgasm of those vessels.\r\nSecondly, the febris inirritativa, or fever with weak pulse, which consists\r\nof a previous torpor of the heart, arteries, and capillaries; and of a\r\nsucceeding orgasm of the capillaries, the torpor of the heart and arteries\r\ncontinuing. But as the frequency of the pulse occurs both in the state of\r\ntorpor, and in that of orgasm, of the heart and arteries; this constitutes\r\na criterion to distinguish fever from other diseases, which are owing to\r\nthe torpor of some parts of the system, as paresis, and hemicrania.\r\n\r\n7. The reader will please to observe, that where the cutaneous or pulmonary\r\ncapillaries are mentioned, their mucous and perspirative glands are to be\r\nunderstood as included; but that the absorbents belonging to those systems\r\nof vessels, and the commencement of the veins, are not always included; as\r\nthese are liable to torpor separately, as in anasarca, and petechiæ; or to\r\norgasm, or increased action, as in the exhibition of strong emetics, or in\r\nthe application of vinegar to the lips; yet he will also please to observe,\r\nthat an increased or decreased action of these absorbents and veins\r\ngenerally occurs along with that of the capillaries, as appears by the dry\r\nskin in hot fits of fever; and from there being generally at the same time\r\nno accumulation of venous blood in the cutaneous vessels, which would\r\nappear by its purple colour.\r\n\r\nII. _Compound fever._\r\n\r\n1. When other parts of the system sympathize with this torpor and orgasm of\r\nthe cutaneous capillaries, and of the heart and arteries; the fever-fit\r\nbecomes more complicated and dangerous; and this in proportion to the\r\nnumber and consequence of such affected parts. Thus if the lungs become\r\naffected, as in going into very cold water, a shortness of breath occurs;\r\nwhich is owing to the collapse or inactivity (not to the active\r\ncontraction, or spasm), of the pulmonary capillaries; which, as the lungs\r\nare not sensible to cold, are not subject to painful sensation, and\r\nconsequent shuddering, like the skin. In this case after a time the\r\npulmonary capillaries, like the cutaneous ones, act with increased energy;\r\nthe breathing, which was before quick, and the air thrown out at each\r\nrespiration in less quantity, and cool to the back of the hand opposed to\r\nit, now becomes larger in quantity, and warmer than natural; which however\r\nis not accompanied with the sensation of heat in the membrane, which lines\r\nthe air-vessels of the lungs, as in the skin.\r\n\r\n2. One consequence of this increased heat of the breath is the increased\r\nevaporation of the mucus on the tongue and nostrils. A viscid material is\r\nsecreted by these membranes to preserve them moist and supple, for the\r\npurposes of the senses of taste and of smell, which are extended beneath\r\ntheir surfaces; this viscid mucus, when the aqueous part of it is\r\nevaporated by the increased heat of the respired air, or is absorbed by the\r\ntoo great action of the mucous absorbents, adheres closely on those\r\nmembranes, and is not without difficulty to be separated from them. This\r\ndryness of the tongue and nostrils is a circumstance therefore worthy to be\r\nattended to; as it shews the increased action of the pulmonary capillaries,\r\nand the consequent increased heat of the expired air; and may thus\r\nindicate, when colder air should be admitted to the patient. See Class I.\r\n1. 3. 1. The middle part of the tongue becomes dry sooner, and recovers its\r\nmoisture later, than the edges of it; because the currents of respired air\r\npass most over the middle part of it. This however is not the case, when\r\nthe dryness of the tongue is owing only to the increased mucous absorption.\r\nWhen however a frequent cough attends pulmonary inflammation, the edges of\r\nthe tongue are liable to be as much furred as the middle of it; as during\r\nthe action of coughing the middle of the tongue is depressed, so as to form\r\nhalf a cylinder, to give a greater aperture for the emission of air from\r\nthe larynx; and the edges of it become thus as much exposed to the currents\r\nof air, as the middle parts of it.\r\n\r\n3. When the internal capillaries or glands sympathize with the cutaneous\r\ncapillaries; or when any of them are previously affected with torpor, and\r\nthe external or cutaneous capillaries are affected secondarily; other\r\nsymptoms are produced, which render the paroxysms of fever still more\r\ncomplicate. Thus if the spleen or pancreas are primarily or secondarily\r\naffected, so as to be rendered torpid or quiescent, they are liable to\r\nbecome enlarged, and to remain so even after the extinction of the\r\nfever-fit. These in some intermittent fevers are perceptible to the hand,\r\nand are called ague-cakes; their tumour seems to be owing to the permanent\r\ntorpor of the absorbent system, the secerning vessels continuing to act\r\nsome time afterwards. If the secretory vessels of the liver are affected\r\nfirst with torpor, and afterwards with orgasm, a greater secretion of bile\r\nis produced, which sometimes causes a diarrhoea. If a torpor of the\r\nkidneys, and of the absorbents of the bladder occurs, either primarily, or\r\nby sympathy with the cutaneous capillaries, the urine is in small quantity\r\nand pale, as explained in Class I. 2. 2. 5.; and if these secretory vessels\r\nof the kidneys, and the absorbents of the bladder act more strongly than\r\nnatural afterwards by their increased irritability or associability, the\r\nurine becomes in larger quantity, and deeper coloured, or deposits its\r\nearthy parts, as in Class I. 1. 2. 4. which has been esteemed a favourable\r\ncircumstance. But if the urine be in small quantity, and no sediment\r\nappears in it, after the hot fit is over; it shews, that the secerning\r\nvessels of the kidneys and the absorbent vessels of the bladder have not\r\nregained the whole of their activity, and thence indicates a greater\r\ntendency to a return of the cold fit.\r\n\r\n4. When the stomach is affected with torpor either primarily; or\r\nsecondarily by its sympathy with the cutaneous capillaries; or with some\r\ninternal viscus; sickness occurs, with a total want of appetite to any\r\nthing solid; vomiting then supervenes, which may often be relieved by a\r\nblister on the skin, if the skin be cool and pale; but not if it be hot and\r\nflushed. The intestines cease to perform their office of absorption from a\r\nsimilar torpor; and a diarrhoea supervenes owing to the acrimony of their\r\nputrid, or of their acid contents. The loose undigested or fetid stools\r\nindicate the inability of the intestines to perform their proper office; as\r\nthe mucus and gastric acid, which are vomited up, does that of the stomach;\r\nthis torpor of the stomach is liable to continue after the cold paroxysm\r\nceases, and to convert intermittent fevers into continued ones by its\r\ndirect sympathy with the heart and arteries. See article 10 of this\r\nSupplement.\r\n\r\n5. If the meninges of the brain sympathize with other torpid parts, or are\r\nprimarily affected, delirium, stupor, and perhaps hydrocephalus internus\r\noccur, see Class II. 1. 7. 1. and I. 2. 5. 10; and sometimes the pulse\r\nbecomes slow, producing paresis instead of fever. But if the membranes,\r\nwhich cover the muscles about the head, or of the pericranium, become\r\ntorpid by their sympathy with other torpid parts, or are primarily\r\naffected, a head-ach supervenes; which however generally ceases with the\r\ncold paroxysm of fever. For as when the sensorial power of volition is\r\nexhausted by labour, a few hours, or half a solar day, passed in sleep\r\nrecruits the system by accumulation of this sensorial power; so when the\r\nsensorial power of irritation is exhausted, one or two solar or lunar days\r\nof rest or quiescence of the affected part will generally restore its\r\naction by accumulation of irritability, and consequent increase of\r\nassociation, as in hemicrania, Class IV. 2. 2. 8. But when the heart and\r\narteries become torpid, either primarily, or by their sympathy with the\r\nstomach, this accumulation of the sensorial power of irritation can take\r\nplace but slowly; _as to rest is death_! This explains the cause of the\r\nduration of fevers with weak pulse, which continue a quarter, or half, or\r\nthree quarters, or a whole lunation, or still longer, before sufficient\r\naccumulation of irritability can be produced to restore their natural\r\nstrength of action.\r\n\r\n6. If the absorbent vessels, which are spread around the neck of the\r\nbladder, become torpid by their direct sympathy with the absorbents of the\r\nskin in cold fits of fever; the urine, which is poured into the bladder in\r\nbut small quantity from the torpid kidneys, has nevertheless none of its\r\naqueous saline part reabsorbed; and this saline part stimulates the bladder\r\nto empty itself frequently, though the urine is in small quantity. Which is\r\nnot therefore owing to any supposed spasm of the bladder, for the action of\r\nit in excluding the urine is weak, and as much controlable by the will as\r\nin ordinary micturition.\r\n\r\n7. If the beginnings or absorbent mouths of the venous system remain\r\ntorpid, petechiæ or vibices are produced in fevers, similar to those which\r\nare seen in scurvy without fever. If the skin was frequently moistened for\r\nan hour, and at the same time exposed to the common air, or to oxygen gas,\r\nit might contribute to turn the black colour of these points of\r\nextravasated blood into scarlet, and thus by increasing its stimulus\r\nfacilitate its reabsorption? For oxygen gas penetrates moist animal\r\nmembranes though not dry ones, as in the lungs during respiration.\r\n\r\n8. When the sensorial power of sensation is introduced into the arterial\r\nsystem, other kinds of compound fevers are produced, which will be spoken\r\nof in their place.\r\n\r\nIII. _Termination of the cold Fit._\r\n\r\n1. If all the parts, which were affected with torpor, regain their\r\nirritability, and associability, the cold paroxysm of fever ceases; but as\r\nsome of the parts affected were previously accustomed to incessant action,\r\nas the heart and arteries, and others only to intermitted action, as the\r\nstomach and intestines; and as those, which are subjected during health to\r\nperpetual action, accumulate sensorial power faster, when their motions are\r\nimpeded, than those which are subjected to intermitted action; it happens,\r\nthat some of the parts, which were affected with torpor during the cold\r\nfit, recover their irritability or associability sooner than others, and\r\nmore perfectly, or acquire a greater quantity of them than natural; as\r\nappears by the partial heat and flushings previous to the general hot fit.\r\n\r\nHence if all the parts, which were previously torpid, regain their due\r\ndegree of irritability, or of associability, the disease is removed, and\r\nhealth restored. If some or all of them acquire more than their natural\r\ndegree of these sensorial powers; increased actions, and consequent\r\nincreased secretions, and greater heat occur, and constitute the hot fit of\r\nfever. If after this hot fit of fever all the parts, which had acquired too\r\ngreat irritability, or associability, regain their natural degree of it;\r\nthe disease is removed, and health restored. But if some of these parts do\r\nnot regain their natural degree of these sensorial powers, the actions of\r\nthose parts remain imperfect, and are more or less injurious to the system,\r\naccording to the importance of their functions.\r\n\r\n2. Thus if a torpor of the heart and arteries remains; the quick pulse\r\nwithout strength, which began in the cold fit, persists; and a continued\r\nfever is produced. If the torpor of the stomach and intestines remains,\r\nwhich are known by sickness and undigested stools, the fever is liable to\r\nbe of considerable length and danger; the same if the kidnies and absorbent\r\nsystem retain some degree of torpor, as is shewn by the pale urine in not\r\nunusual quantity. If part of the absorbent system remains torpid, as the\r\nabsorbent vessels of the spleen, a tumour of that viscus occurs, which may\r\nbe felt by the hand; the same sometimes happens to the liver; and these\r\nfrom their tendency to more complete torpor are afterwards liable to give\r\noccasion to a return of the cold fit. If the cellular absorbents do not\r\ncompletely recover their activity, a pale and bloated countenance with\r\nswelled legs mark their want of action.\r\n\r\n3. As the termination of the cold fit is owing to the accumulation of the\r\nsensorial power of irritation and of association during the previous\r\nquiescence of the system; and as those parts, which are in perpetual action\r\nduring health, are more subject to this accumulation during their torpor,\r\nor quiescence; one should have imagined, that the heart and arteries would\r\nacquire this accumulation of sensorial power sooner or in greater degree\r\nthan other parts. This indeed so happens, where the pulse is previously\r\nstrong, as in febris irritativa; or where another sensorial power, as that\r\nof sensation, is exerted on the arterial system, as in inflammations. The\r\nheart and arteries in these cases soon recover from their torpor, and are\r\nexerted with great violence.\r\n\r\nMany other parts of the system subject to perpetual motion in health may\r\nrest for a time without much inconvenience to the whole; as when the\r\nfingers of some people become cold and pale; and during this complete rest\r\ngreat accumulation of irritability may be produced, But where the heart and\r\narteries are previously feeble, they cannot much diminish their actions,\r\nand certainly cannot rest entirely, for that would be death; and therefore\r\nin this case their accumulation of the sensorial power of irritation or of\r\nassociation is slowly produced, and a long fever supervenes in consequence;\r\nor sudden death, as frequently happens, terminates the cold fit.\r\n\r\nWhence it appears, that in fevers with weak pulse, if the action of the\r\nheart, arteries, and capillaries could be diminished, or stopped for a\r\nshort time without occasioning the death of the patient, as happens in cold\r\nbathing, or to persons apparently drowned, that a great accumulation of the\r\nsensorial powers of irritation or of association might soon be produced,\r\nand the pulse become stronger, and consequently slower, and the fever\r\ncease. Hence cold ablution may be of service in fevers with weak pulse, by\r\npreventing the expenditure and producing accumulation of the sensorial\r\npower of irritation or association. Stupor may be useful on the same\r\naccount. Could a centrifugal swing be serviceable for this purpose, either\r\nby placing the head or the feet in the outward part of the circle, as\r\ndescribed in Art. 15. 7. of this Supplement?\r\n\r\nIV. _Return of the cold Fit._\r\n\r\n1. If the increased action of the cutaneous and pulmonary capillaries, and\r\nof the heart and arteries, in febris irritativa continues long and with\r\nviolence, a proportional expenditure or exhaustion of sensorial power\r\noccurs; which by its tendency to induce torpor of some part, or of the\r\nwhole, brings on a return of the cold fit.\r\n\r\n2. Another cause which contributes to induce torpor of the whole system by\r\nthe sympathy of its parts with each other, is the remaining torpor of some\r\nviscus; which after the last cold paroxysm had not recovered itself, as of\r\nthe spleen, liver, kidnies, or of the stomach and intestines, or absorbent\r\nvessels, as above mentioned.\r\n\r\n3. Other causes are the deficiency of the natural stimuli, as hunger,\r\nthirst, and want of fresh air. Other causes are great fatigue, want of\r\nrest, fear, grief, or anxiety of mind. And lastly, the influence of\r\nexternal ethereal fluids, as the defect of external heat, and of solar or\r\nlunar gravitation. Of the latter the return of the paroxysms of continued\r\nfevers about six o'clock in the evening, when the solar gravitation is the\r\nleast, affords an example of the influence of it; and the usual periods of\r\nintermittents, whether quotidian, tertian, or quartan, which so regularly\r\nobey solar or lunar days, afford instances of the influence of those\r\nluminaries on these kinds of fevers.\r\n\r\n4. If the tendency to torpor of some viscus is considerable, this will be\r\nincreased at the time, when the terrene gravitation is greatest, as\r\nexplained in the introduction to Class IV. 2. 4. and may either produce a\r\ncold paroxysm of quotidian fever; or it may not yet be sufficient in\r\nquantity for that purpose, but may nevertheless become greater, and\r\ncontinue so till the next period of the greatest terrene gravitation, and\r\nmay then either produce a paroxysm of tertian fever; or may still become\r\ngreater, and continue so till the next period of greatest terrene\r\ngravitation, and then produce a paroxysm of quartan ague. And lastly, the\r\nperiodical times of these paroxysms may exceed, or fall short of, the time\r\nof greatest diurnal terrene gravitation according to the time of day, or\r\nperiod of the moon, in which the first fit began; that is, whether the\r\ndiurnal terrene gravitation was then in an increasing or decreasing state.\r\n\r\nV. _Sensation excited in Fever._\r\n\r\n1. A curious observation is related by Dr. Fordyce in his Tract on Simple\r\nfever, page 168. He asserts, that those people, who have been confined some\r\ntime in a very warm atmosphere, as of 120 or 130 degrees of heat, do not\r\nfeel cold, nor are subject to paleness of their skins, on coming into a\r\ntemperature of 30 or 40 degrees; which would produce great paleness and\r\npainful sensation of coldness in those, who had been some time confined in\r\nan atmosphere of only 86 or 90 degrees. Analogous to this, an observing\r\nfriend of mine assured me, that once having sat up to a very late hour with\r\nthree or four very ingenious and humorous companions, and drank a\r\nconsiderable quantity of wine; both contrary to his usual habits of life;\r\nand being obliged to rise early, and to ride a long journey on the next\r\nday; he expected to have found himself weak and soon fatigued; but on the\r\ncontrary he performed his journey with unusual ease and alacrity; and\r\nfrequently laughed, as he rode, at the wit of the preceding evening. In\r\nboth these cases a degree of pain or pleasure actuated the system; and thus\r\na sensorial power, that of sensation, was superadded to that of irritation,\r\nor volition. See Sect. XXXIV. 2. 6.\r\n\r\n2. Similar to this, when the energetic exertions of some parts of the\r\nsystem in the hot fit of fever arise to a certain excess, a degree of\r\nsensation is produced; as of heat, which particularly increases the actions\r\nof the cutaneous vessels, which are more liable to be excited by this\r\nstimulus. When this additional sensorial power of sensation exists to a\r\ngreater degree, the pulse, which was before full, now becomes hard, owing\r\nto the inflammation of the vasa vasorum, or coats of the arteries. In these\r\ncases, whether there is any topical inflammation or not, the fever ceases\r\nto intermit; but nevertheless there are daily remissions and exacerbations\r\nof it; which recur for the most part about six in the evening, when the\r\nsolar gravitation is the least, as mentioned in Sect. XXXVI. 3. 7.\r\n\r\n3. Thus the introduction of another sensorial power, that of sensation,\r\nconverts an intermittent fever into a continued one. If it be attended with\r\nstrong pulse, it is termed febris sensitiva irritata, or pyrexia, or\r\ninflammation; if with a weak pulse, it is termed febris sensitiva\r\ninirritata, or typhus gravior, or malignant fever. The seat of the\r\ninflammation is in the glandular or capillary system, as it consists in the\r\nsecretion of new fluids, or new fibres, which form new vessels, as they\r\nharden, like the silk of the silk-worm. See Art. 15. of this Supplement.\r\n\r\nVI. _Circles of irritative Associate Motions._\r\n\r\n1. There are some associate motions, which are perpetually proceeding in\r\nour waking hours, and are catenated by their first link, or in some\r\nsubsequent parts of the chain, with the stimuli or the influence of\r\nexternal things; which we shall here enumerate, as they contribute to the\r\nknowledge of fever. Of these are the irritative ideas, or sensual motions\r\nof the organs of sense, and the muscular motions associated with them;\r\nwhich, when the chain is disturbed or interrupted, excite the sensorial\r\npower of sensation, and proceed in confusion. Thus if the irritative ideas\r\nof sight are disturbed, the paralactic motions of objects, which in general\r\nare unperceived, become sensible to us; and the locomotive muscles\r\nassociated with them, which ought to preserve the body erect, stagger from\r\nthis decrease or interruption of the sensorial power of association; and\r\nvertigo is produced.\r\n\r\nWhen the irritative sensual motions, or ideas, belonging to one sense are\r\nincreased or diminished, the irritative sensual motions, or ideas, of the\r\nother senses are liable to become disturbed by their general catenations;\r\nwhence occur noises in the ears, bad tastes in the mouth, bad odours, and\r\nnumbness or tingling of the limbs, as a greater or less number of senses\r\nare affected. These constitute concomitant circles of disturbed irritative\r\nideas; or make a part of the great circle of irritative ideas, or motions\r\nof the organs of sense; and when thus disturbed occasion many kinds of\r\nhallucination of our other senses, or attend on the vertigo of vision.\r\n\r\n2. Another great circle of irritative associated motions consists of those\r\nof the alimentary canal; which are catenated with stimuli or with\r\ninfluences external to the system, but continue to be exerted in our\r\nsleeping as well as in our waking hours. When these associations of motion\r\nare disturbed by the too great or too small stimulus of the food taken into\r\nthe stomach, or by the too great excess or deprivation of heat, or by\r\nindigestible substances, or by torpor or orgasm occasioned by their\r\nassociation with other parts, various diseases are induced under the names\r\nof apepsia, hypochondriasis, hysteria, diarrhoea, cholera, ileus,\r\nnephritis, fever.\r\n\r\n3. A third circle of irritative associate motions consists of those of the\r\nabsorbent system; which may be divided into two, the lacteals, and the\r\nlymphatics. When the stomach and intestines are recently filled with food\r\nand fluid, the lacteal system is stimulated into great action; at the same\r\ntime the cellular, cutaneous, and pulmonary lymphatics act with less\r\nenergy; because less fluid is then wanted from those branches, and because\r\nmore sensorial power is expended by the lacteal branch. On this account\r\nthese two systems of absorbents are liable to act by reverse sympathy;\r\nhence pale urine is made after a full dinner, as less of the aqueous part\r\nof it is imbibed by the urinary lymphatics; and hence the water in anasarca\r\nof the lungs and limbs is speedily absorbed, when the actions of the\r\nlacteals of the stomach or intestines are weakened or inverted by the\r\nexhibition of those drugs, which produce nausea, or by violent vomiting, or\r\nviolent cathartics.\r\n\r\nHence in diabetes the lacteal system acts strongly, at the same time that\r\nthe urinary lymphatics invert their motions, and transmit the chyle into\r\nthe bladder; and in diarrhoea from crapula, or too great a quantity of food\r\nand fluid taken at a time, the lacteals act strongly, and absorb chyle or\r\nfluids from the stomach and upper intestines; while the lymphatics of the\r\nlower intestines revert their motions, and transmit this over-repletion\r\ninto the lower intestines, and thus produce diarrhoea; which accounts for\r\nthe speedy operation of some cathartic drugs, when much fluid is taken\r\nalong with them.\r\n\r\n4. Other circles of irritative associate motions of great importance are\r\nthose of the secerning system; of these are the motions of the larger\r\ncongeries of glands, which form the liver, spleen, pancreas, gastric\r\nglands, kidneys, salivary glands, and many others; some of which act by\r\ndirect and others by reverse sympathy with each other. Thus when the\r\ngastric glands act most powerfully, as when the stomach is filled with\r\nfood, the kidneys act with less energy; as is shewn by the small secretion\r\nof urine for the first hour or two after dinner; which reverse sympathy is\r\noccasioned by the greater expenditure of sensorial power on the gastric\r\nglands, and to the newly absorbed fluids not yet being sufficiently\r\nanimalized, or otherwise prepared, to stimulate the secretory vessels of\r\nthe kidneys.\r\n\r\nBut those very extensive glands, which secrete the perspirable matter of\r\nthe skin and lungs, with the mucus, which lubricates all the internal cells\r\nand cavities of the body, claim our particular attention. These glands, as\r\nwell as all the others, proceed from the capillary vessels, which unite the\r\narteries with the veins, and are not properly a part of them; the mucous\r\nand perspirative glands, which arise from the cutaneous and pulmonary\r\ncapillaries, are associated by direct sympathy; as appears from immersion\r\nin the cold bath, which is therefore attended with a temporary difficult\r\nrespiration; while those from the capillaries of the stomach and heart and\r\narteries are more generally associated by reverse sympathy with those of\r\nthe cutaneous capillaries; as appears in fevers with weak pulse and\r\nindigestion, and at the same time with a hot and dry skin.\r\n\r\nThe disturbed actions of this circle of the associate motions of the\r\nsecerning system, when the sensorial power of sensation is added to that of\r\nirritation, frequently produces inflammation, which consists in the\r\nsecretion of new fluids or new vessels. Nevertheless, if these disturbed\r\nactions be of the torpid kind, the pain, which attends them, is seldom\r\nproductive of inflammation, as in hemicrania; but is liable to excite\r\nvoluntary actions, and thus to expend much sensorial power, as in the\r\nshuddering in cold fits of fever, or in convulsions; or lastly the pain\r\nitself, which attends torpid actions, is liable to expend or exhaust much\r\nsensorial power without producing any increased actions; whence the low\r\npulse, and cold extremities, which usually attend hemicrania; and hence\r\nwhen inert, or inactive sensation attends one link of associated action,\r\nthe succeeding link is generally rendered torpid, as a coldness of the\r\ncheek attends tooth-ach.\r\n\r\n5. A fifth important circle of irritative motions is that of the\r\nsanguiferous system, in which the capillary vessels are to be included,\r\nwhich unite the arterial and venous systems, both pulmonary and aortal. The\r\ndisturbed action of this system of the heart and arteries, and capillaries,\r\nconstitute simple fever; to which may be added, that the secerning and\r\nabsorbent vessels appending to the capillaries, and the bibulous mouths of\r\nthe veins, are in some measure at the same time generally affected.\r\n\r\n6. Now, though the links of each of these circles of irritative motions are\r\nmore strictly associated together, yet are they in greater or less degree\r\nassociated or catenated with each other by direct or reverse sympathy. Thus\r\nthe sickness, or inverted irritative motions of the stomach, are associated\r\nor catenated with the disturbed irritative ideas, or sensual motions, in\r\nvertigo; as in sea-sickness. This sickness of the stomach is also\r\nassociated or catenated with the torpor of the heart and arteries by direct\r\nsympathy, and with the capillaries and absorbents by reverse sympathy; and\r\nare thus all of them liable occasionally to be disturbed, when one of them\r\nis diseased; and constitute the great variety of the kinds or symptoms of\r\nfevers.\r\n\r\nVII. _Alternation of the cold and hot Fits._\r\n\r\n1. When any cause occurs, which diminishes to a certain degree the supply\r\nof sensorial power in respect to the whole system; as suppose a temporary\r\ninexertion of the brain; what happens? First, those motions are exerted\r\nwith less energy, which are not immediately necessary to life, as the\r\nlocomotive muscles; and those ideas, which are generally excited by\r\nvolition; at the same time this deficiency of voluntary motion is different\r\nfrom that which occurs in sleep; as in that the movements of the arterial\r\nsystem are increased in energy though not in frequency. Next, the motions\r\nof the alimentary canal become performed with less energy, or cease\r\naltogether; and a total want of appetite to solid food occurs, or sickness,\r\nor a diarrhoea occasioned by the indigested aliment. Then the absorbent\r\nvessels cease to act with their due energy; whence thirst, and pale urine,\r\nthough in small quantities. Fourthly, the secerning vessels become affected\r\nby the general diminution of sensorial power; whence all the secreted\r\nfluids are produced in less quantity. And lastly, the sanguiferous canals\r\nfeel the general torpor; the pulsations of the heart and arteries become\r\nfeeble, and consequently quick; and the capillaries of the skin become\r\ninactive, acquire less blood from the arteries, and are consequently paler\r\nand shrunk.\r\n\r\nIn this last circumstance of the torpor of the sanguiferous system consists\r\ninirritative fever; as all the others are rather accidental or concomitant\r\nsymptoms, and not essential ones; as fewer or more of them may be present,\r\nor may exist with a greater or less degree of inactivity.\r\n\r\n2. Now as the capillaries of the skin are exposed to greater varieties of\r\nheat and cold, than the heart and arteries, they are supposed to be more\r\nmobile, that is, more susceptible of torpor or exertion, or to\r\ninflammation, by external stimuli or influences, than the other parts of\r\nthe sanguiferous system; and as the skin is more sensible to the presence\r\nof heat, than the internal parts of the body, the commencement of the cold\r\nparoxysms of fever generally either first exists in, or is first perceived\r\nby, the coldness and paleness of the skin; and the commencement of the hot\r\nfits by the heat and redness of it.\r\n\r\n3. The accumulation of sensorial power occurs in these organs soonest, and\r\nin greatest quantity, during their quiescence, which were most perpetually\r\nin action during health; hence those parts of the system soonest recover\r\nfrom torpor in intermittent fever, and soonest fall into the contrary\r\nextreme of increased activity; as the sanguiferous system of the heart and\r\narteries and capillaries. But of these the capillaries seem first to\r\nacquire a renovation of their action, as the heat of the skin becomes first\r\nrenewed, as well as increased beyond its natural quantity, and this in some\r\nparts sooner than in others; which quantity of heat is however not to be\r\nestimated simply by the rise of the mercury in the thermometer, but also by\r\nthe quantity carried away into the atmosphere, or diffused amongst other\r\nbodies in a given time; as more heat passes through water, which boils\r\nvehemently, than when it boils gently, though the rise of the thermometer\r\nin both cases continues the same. This fact may be known by boiling an egg\r\nin water, the white of which coagulates in much less time, if the water\r\nboils vehemently, than if it boils moderately, though the sensible heat of\r\nthe water is the same in both cases.\r\n\r\nAnother cause, which induces the cutaneous capillaries to renew their\r\nactions sooner than the heart and arteries after immersion in the cold\r\nbath, is, that their torpor was occasioned by defect of irritation; whereas\r\nthat of the heart and arteries was occasioned by defect of association;\r\nwhich defect of association was owing to the decreased actions of the\r\ncapillaries, and is now again excited by their renewed action; which\r\nexcitement must therefore be subsequent to that increased action of the\r\ncapillaries; and in consequence the increased action of the heart and\r\narteries at the commencement of the hot fit of some fevers is subsequent to\r\nthe increased action of the cutaneous capillaries. There is, however, in\r\nthis case an accumulation of the sensorial power of association in the\r\nheart and arteries, which must contribute to increase their orgasm in the\r\nhot fit, as well as the increased excitement of it by the increased action\r\nof the capillaries.\r\n\r\n4. Now this increased action of the system, during the hot fit, by\r\nexhausting the sensorial powers of irritation and association, contributes\r\nto induce a renewal of the cold paroxysm; as the accumulation of those\r\nsensorial powers in the cold fit produces the increased actions of the hot\r\nfit; which two states of the system reciprocally induce each other by a\r\nkind of libration, or a plus and minus, of the sensorial powers of\r\nirritation and association.\r\n\r\nIf the exhaustion of sensorial power during the hot fit of fever only\r\nreduces the quantity of irritability and associability to its natural\r\nstandard, the fever is cured, not being liable to return. If the quantity\r\nof these sensorial powers be reduced only so much, as not to produce a\r\nsecond cold fit during the present quantity of external stimuli or\r\ninfluences; yet it may be so far reduced, that a very small subtraction of\r\nstimulus, or of influence, may again induce a cold fit; such as the\r\ncoldness of the night-air, or the diminution of solar or lunar gravitation,\r\nas in intermittent fevers.\r\n\r\n5. Another cause of the renovation of the cold fits of fever is from some\r\nparts of the system not having completely recovered from the former cold\r\nparoxysm; as happens to the spleen, liver, or other internal viscus; which\r\nsometimes remains tumid, and either occasions a return of the cold fit by\r\ndirect sympathy with other parts of the body, or by its own want of action\r\ncauses a diminution of the general quantity of heat, and thus facilitates\r\nthe renovation of the torpor of the whole system, and gives cause to\r\nintermittent fevers catenated with lunar or solar influence.\r\n\r\nVIII. _Orgasm of the Capillaries._\r\n\r\nAs the remaining torpor of some less essential part of the system, as of\r\nthe spleen, when the hot fit ceases, produces after one, two, or three days\r\na return of cold fit by direct sympathy with the cutaneous capillaries,\r\nwhen joined with some other cause of torpor, as the defect of solar or\r\nlunar influences, or the exposure to cold or hunger, and thus gives origin\r\nto intermittent fever; so the remaining torpor of some more essential parts\r\nof the system, as of the stomach and intestines, is probably the cause of\r\nthe immediate recurrence of the cold paroxysm, at the time the hot one\r\nceases, by their direct sympathy with the cutaneous capillaries, without\r\nthe assistance of any other cause of torpor; and thus produces remittent\r\nfever. And lastly the remaining torpor of some still more essential parts\r\nof the system, as the heart and arteries, after the hot fit ought to cease,\r\nis liable by reverse sympathy with the cutaneous capillaries to continue\r\ntheir orgasm, and thus to render a fever continual, which would otherwise\r\nremit or intermit.\r\n\r\nMany difficulties here occur, which we shall endeavour to throw some light\r\nupon, and leave to future investigation; observing only that difficulties\r\nwere to be expected, otherwise fevers would long since have been\r\nunderstood, as they have employed the unremitted attention of the\r\nphysicians of all ages of the world.\r\n\r\n1. Why do the same parts of successive trains of action sometimes affect\r\neach other by direct, and sometimes by reverse sympathy?--1st, When any\r\nirritative motion ceases, or becomes torpid, which was before in perpetual\r\naction; it is either deprived of its usual stimulus, and thence the\r\nsensorial power of irritation is not excited; or it has been previously too\r\nmuch stimulated, and the sensorial power has been thus exhausted.\r\n\r\nIn the former case an accumulation of sensorial power soon occurs, which is\r\nexcitable by a renewal of the stimulus; as when the fingers, which have\r\nbeen immersed some time in snow, are again exposed to the usual warmth of a\r\nroom. Or, secondly, the sensorial power of irritation becomes so much\r\naccumulated, that the motions, which were torpid, are now performed by less\r\nstimulus than natural; as appears by the warmth, which soon occurs after\r\nthe first chill in going into frosty air, or into the bath at Buxton, which\r\nis about eighty degrees of heat. Or, lastly, this accumulation of the\r\nsensorial power of irritation so far abounds, that it increases the action\r\nof the next link of the associated train or tribe of motions; thus on\r\nexposing the skin to cold air, as in walking out in a frosty morning, the\r\nactions of the stomach are increased, and digestion strengthened.\r\n\r\nBut where the torpor of some irritative motion is owing to the previous\r\nexhaustion of the sensorial power of irritation by too great stimulus, the\r\nrestoration of it occurs either not at all, or much more slowly than in the\r\nformer instances; thus after intoxication the stomach is very slow in\r\nrecovering its due quantity of the sensorial power of irritation, and never\r\nshews any accumulation of it.\r\n\r\n2. When an associate motion, as described in the introduction to Class IV.\r\n1. 1. acts with less energy, the sensorial power of association is either\r\nnot sufficiently excited by the preceding fibrous motions; or it has been\r\nexpended or exhausted by the too violent actions of the preceding fibrous\r\nmotions. In the former case there occurs an accumulation of the sensorial\r\npower of association; exactly as, where the usual stimulus is withdrawn,\r\nthere occurs an accumulation of the sensorial power of irritation. Thus\r\nwhen the actions of the capillaries of the skin are diminished by immersion\r\nin cold water, the capillaries of the lungs are rendered torpid by the want\r\nof the excitement of the sensorial power of association, owing to the\r\nlessened actions of the previous fibrous motions, namely, of those of the\r\nskin. Nevertheless as soon as the capillaries of the skin regain their\r\nincreased activity by the accumulation of the sensorial power of\r\nirritation, these capillaries of the lungs act with greater energy also\r\nowing to their accumulated sensorial power of association. These are\r\ninstances of direct sympathy, and constitute the cold and hot paroxysms of\r\nintermittent fever; or the first paroxysm of a continued one.\r\n\r\n3. When the first link of a train of associated motions, which is subject\r\nto perpetual action, becomes a considerable time torpid for want of being\r\nexcited by the previous exertions of the irritative motions, with which it\r\nis catenated; the sensorial power of association becomes accumulated in so\r\ngreat a degree as to affect the second link of the train of associated\r\nmotions, and to excite it into stronger action. Thus when the stomach is\r\nrendered torpid by contagious matter swallowed into it mixed with the\r\nsaliva, the heart and arteries act more feebly; because the sensorial power\r\nof association, which used to be excited by the fibrous motions of the\r\nstomach, is not now excited; and in consequence the motions of the heart\r\nand arteries act only by the sensorial power of irritation, which is\r\nexcited by the stimulus of the blood.\r\n\r\nBut during this torpor of the stomach, and less action of the heart and\r\narteries, so great an accumulation of the sensorial powers of irritation\r\nand of association occurs, that it adds to the action of the next link of\r\nthis vital circle of actions, that is, to that of the cutaneous\r\ncapillaries. Whence in this situation the torpor of the stomach occasions a\r\ndiminished action of the heart and arteries by direct sympathy, and may be\r\nsaid to occasion an increased one of the cutaneous capillaries by reverse\r\nsympathy; which constitute continued fever with weak pulse.\r\n\r\nNor is this increased action of the capillaries in consequence of the\r\ndecreased action of the heart and arteries, as in fevers with weak pulse, a\r\nsingle fact in the animal economy; though it exists in this case in the\r\ngreatest degree or duration, because the heart and arteries are perpetually\r\nin greater action than any other part of the system. But a similar\r\ncircumstance occurs, when the stomach is rendered inactive by defective\r\nexcitement of the sensorial power of association, as in sea-sickness, or in\r\nnephritis. In these cases the sensorial power of association becomes much\r\naccumulated in the stomach, and seems by its superabundance to excite the\r\nabsorbent system, which is so nearly connected with it, into great increase\r\nof action; as is known by the great quantity frequently in these situations\r\nrejected by vomit, which could not otherways be supplied. It is probable\r\nthe increase of digestion by walking in frosty air, with many other animal\r\nfacts, may by future observations be found to be dependent on this\r\nprinciple, as well as the increased action of the capillaries in continued\r\nfevers with weak pulse.\r\n\r\nWhereas in continued fever with strong pulse, which may perhaps occur\r\nsometimes on the first day even of the plague, the stomach with the heart\r\nand arteries and the capillaries act by direct sympathy; that is, the\r\nstomach is excited into stronger action by increased irritation owing to\r\nthe stimulus of contagious matter; these stronger irritative motions of the\r\nstomach excite a greater quantity of the sensorial power of association,\r\nwhich then actuates the heart and arteries with greater energy, as these\r\nare catenated with the stomach; and in the same manner the increased\r\nactions of the heart and arteries excite a greater quantity of the\r\nsensorial power of association, which actuates the cutaneous capillaries\r\nwith increase of energy. See Class IV. 1. 1.\r\n\r\n4. I shall dwell a little longer on this intricate subject. The\r\ncommencement of fever-fits is known by the inactivity of the cutaneous\r\ncapillaries, which inactivity is observable by the paleness and coldness of\r\nthe skin, and also by the pain of coldness, which attends it. There is\r\nnevertheless in most cases, except those which are owing to exposure to\r\nexternal cold, a torpor of the capillaries of some internal viscus\r\npreceding this inactivity of the cutaneous capillaries; which is known, by\r\nthe tumour or hardness of the viscus, or by an aching pain of it. The\r\ncapillaries of the lungs are at the same time rendered inactive or torpid,\r\nas appears by the difficulty of breathing, and coldness of the breath in\r\ncold fits of fever, and in going into the cold bath; but the lungs are not\r\naffected with the pain either of coldness or of torpor.\r\n\r\nOne cause of this synchronous or successive inactivity of the cutaneous\r\ncapillaries, in consequence of the previous torpor of some internal viscus,\r\nmay be owing to the deficiency of heat; which must occur, when any part\r\nbecomes inactive; because the secretions of that part cease or are\r\nlessened, and the quantity of heat of it in consequence. But the principal\r\ncause of it I suppose to be owing to the defect of the sensorial power of\r\nassociation; which power of association is excited by some previous or\r\nconcomitant motions of the parts of every great circle of actions. This\r\nappears on going into the cold bath, because the shortness of breath\r\ninstantly occurs, sooner than one can conceive the diminution of the heat\r\nof the skin could affect the lungs by the want of its stimulus; but not\r\nsooner than the defect of the sensorial power of association could affect\r\nthem; because this must cease to be excited into action on the instant that\r\nthe cutaneous capillaries cease to act; whence in the first moment of\r\ncontact of the cold water the cutaneous capillaries cease to act from\r\ndefect of irritation; which is caused by defect of the stimulus of heat;\r\nand in the second moment the capillaries of the lungs cease to act from the\r\ndefect of association; which is caused by the defect of the motions of the\r\ncutaneous capillaries. Thus the universal torpor in the cold paroxysm of\r\nfever is an example of direct sympathy, though occasioned in part by defect\r\nof irritation, and in part by defect of association.\r\n\r\n5. Thus in walking out in a frosty morning the skin is cooled by the\r\ncontact of the cold air, whence the actions of its capillaries are\r\ndiminished for want of their usual stimulus of heat to excite a sufficient\r\nquantity of the sensorial power of irritation. Hence there is at first a\r\nsaving of sensorial power of irritation for the purpose of actuating the\r\nother parts of the system with greater energy. Secondly the sensorial power\r\nof association, which used to be excited by the motions of the cutaneous\r\ncapillaries, is now not so powerfully excited; and in consequence the\r\nparts, which constitute the next links of the circles of associated\r\nmotions, are for a time actuated with less energy, and a temporary general\r\nchillness succeeds; which is so far similar to the cold fit of intermittent\r\nfever.\r\n\r\nIn this situation there is a curious circumstance occurs, which merits\r\npeculiar attention: after a short time, though the external skin continues\r\ncool by its exposure to the cold air, and the actions of its capillaries\r\nare consequently diminished, yet the capillaries of the stomach act with\r\ngreater energy; as is known by increased digestion and consequent hunger.\r\nThis is to be ascribed to the accumulation of the sensorial power of\r\nirritation, which now excites by its superabundance, or overflowing, as it\r\nwere, the stomach into increased action; though it is at the same time\r\nexcited less powerfully than usual by the sensorial power of association.\r\nThus the accumulation of the sensorial power of irritation in the vessels\r\nof the skin increases in this case the action of the stomach, in the same\r\nmanner as an accumulation of the sensorial power of association in the\r\nheart and arteries in fevers with weak pulse increases the action of the\r\ncapillaries.\r\n\r\nIf nevertheless the coldness of the skin be too long continued, or exists\r\nin too great a degree, so as in some measure to impair the life of the\r\npart, no further accumulation of the sensorial power of irritation occurs;\r\nand in consequence the actions of the stomach become less than natural by\r\nthe defect of the sensorial power of association; which has ceased to be\r\nexcited by the want of action of the cutaneous capillaries. Whence\r\ncontinued coldness of the feet is accompanied with indigestion and\r\nheartburn. See Class IV. 2. 1. 6.\r\n\r\n6. Similar to this when the actions of the stomach are rendered torpid by\r\nthe previous stimulus of a violent emetic, and its motions become\r\nretrograde in consequence, a great quantity of sensorial power is exerted\r\non the lymphatics of the lungs, and other parts of the body; which excites\r\nthem into greater direct action, as is evinced by the exhibition of\r\ndigitalis in anasarca. In this situation I suppose the emetic drug\r\nstimulates the muscular fibres of the stomach into too great action; and\r\nthat in consequence a great torpor soon succeeds; and that this inaction of\r\nthe muscular parts of the stomach is not followed by much accumulation of\r\nthe sensorial power of irritation; because that sensorial power is in great\r\nmeasure exhausted by the previous excessive stimulus. But the lymphatics of\r\nthe stomach have their actions lessened by defect of the sensorial power of\r\nassociation, which is not now excited into action, owing to the lessened\r\nmotions of the muscular parts of it, with which the lymphatics are\r\nassociated. The sensorial power of association becomes therefore\r\naccumulated in these lymphatics of the stomach, because it is not excited\r\ninto action; exactly as the power of irritation becomes accumulated in the\r\nhand, when immersed in snow; and this accumulated sensorial power of\r\nassociation excites the lymphatic of the lungs and of other parts, which\r\nare most nearly associated with those of the stomach, into more energetic\r\nactions. Thus the muscular fibres of the stomach act with the lymphatics of\r\nthat organ in direct sympathy; and the lymphatics of the stomach act in\r\nreverse sympathy with those of the lungs and of other parts of the body;\r\nthe former of which is caused by defect of the excitement of the sensorial\r\npower of association, and the latter by the accumulation of it.\r\n\r\nBesides the efficient cause, as above explained, the final cause, or\r\nconvenience, of these organic actions are worthy our attention. In this\r\ncase of an acrid drug swallowed into the stomach the reverted actions of\r\nthe muscular fibres of the stomach tend to eject its enemy; the reverted\r\nactions of its lymphatics pour a great quantity of fluids into the stomach\r\nfor the purpose of diluting or washing off the noxious drug; and the\r\nincreased actions of the other lymphatics supply these retrograde ones of\r\nthe stomach with an inconceivable supply of fluids, as is seen in Ileus and\r\nCholera.\r\n\r\n7. The inquisitive reader will excuse my continuing this subject, though\r\nperhaps with some repetitions, as it envelopes the very essence of fever.\r\nWhen the first link of a train of actions is excited by excessive stimulus,\r\nor excessive irritability, and thus acts with unusual energy by the\r\nincreased quantity of irritation, these increased motions excite a greater\r\nquantity of the sensorial power of association, which causes increased\r\nmotions in the second link, which is catenated with the first; and then the\r\nexcessive action of this second link excites also a greater quantity of the\r\nsensorial power of association, which increases the motions of the third\r\nlink of this chain of association, and thus the increase of the stimulus on\r\nthe irritative motions, to which the chain of association is catenated,\r\nincreases the action of the whole chain or circle of associated motions.\r\n\r\nAfter a time the irritative motions become torpid by expenditure of the\r\nsensorial power of irritation, and then the power of association also\r\nbecomes less exerted, both because it has been in part exhausted by too\r\ngreat action, and is now less excited by the lessened action of the\r\nirritative motions, which used to excite it. These are both instances of\r\ndirect sympathy, and frequently constitute the cold and hot fit of\r\nintermittents.\r\n\r\nBut though the accumulation of the sensorial power of irritation during the\r\nquiescence of some motion owing to want of stimulus generally induces\r\ntorpor in the first link of the train of associated motions catenated with\r\nit; as the capillaries of the lungs become torpid immediately on immersion\r\nof the skin into cold water; yet in some situations an orgasm or excess of\r\naction is produced in the first link of the associated motions thus\r\ncatenated with irritative ones; as in the increased action of the stomach,\r\nwhen the skin is for a time exposed to cold air; which may in part be\r\nascribed to the general increase of action of the whole system, owing to\r\nthe diminished expenditure of sensorial power, but particularly of the\r\nparts, which have habitually acted together; as when one arm is paralytic\r\nthe other is liable to more frequent or almost continual motion; and when\r\none eye becomes blind the other frequently becomes stronger; which is well\r\nknown to farriers, who are said sometimes to destroy the sight of one eye\r\nto strengthen that of the other in diseased horses.\r\n\r\nHence there is sometimes a direct sympathy, and sometimes a reverse one\r\nsucceeds the torpor occasioned by defect of stimulus, the latter of which\r\nis perhaps owing to a certain time being required for the production of an\r\naccumulation of the sensorial power of irritation by the nervous branches\r\nof the torpid organ; which accumulation is now in part or entirely derived\r\nto the next link of the association. Thus in going into a coldish bath, as\r\ninto a river in the summer months, we at first experience a difficulty of\r\nbreathing from the torpid action of the pulmonary capillaries, owing to the\r\ndeficient excitement of the sensorial power of association in consequence\r\nof the torpor of the cutaneous capillaries. But in a very short time, as in\r\none minute, the sensorial power of irritation becomes accumulated by the\r\ninactivity of the cutaneous capillaries; and as its superabundance becomes\r\nnow expended on the pulmonary capillaries, the difficult respiration\r\nceases; though the cutaneous capillaries continue torpid by their contact\r\nwith the cold water, and consequently the sensorial power of association,\r\nwhich used to contribute to actuate the pulmonary capillaries, is less\r\nexcited.\r\n\r\n8. In like manner when there exists an accumulation of the sensorial power\r\nof association, owing to defect of its excitement by some previous\r\nirritative or associate motions, it is generally accompanied for a certain\r\ntime by a torpor not only of the link first affected, but of the subsequent\r\nparts, or of the whole train of associated motions, as in the cold fits of\r\nintermittent fevers. Yet after a time an increased action of the next links\r\nof associated motions succeeds the torpor of the first, as the absorbent\r\nvessels of the lungs act more violently in consequence of the deficient\r\naction of those of the stomach; and the skin at the commencement of\r\nsickness is pale and cold, but in a little time becomes flushed and warm.\r\n\r\nThus we see in associate motions, which are rendered torpid by defect of\r\nexcitement, that sometimes a direct, and sometimes a reverse sympathy\r\nsucceeds in the subsequent links of the chain. But I believe where a torpor\r\nof irritative or of the associate motions is caused by a previous too great\r\nexpenditure or exhaustion of the sensorial powers of irritation or\r\nassociation, no increase of action in the subsequent link ever occurs, or\r\nnot till after a very long time.\r\n\r\nThus when the stomach becomes torpid by previous violent exertion, and\r\nconsequent exhaustion of the sensorial power of irritation, as after\r\nintoxication with wine or opium, or after the exhibition of some violent\r\nemetic drug, the torpor is communicated to the heart and arteries, as in\r\ncontinued fevers with weak pulse. But where the torpor of the stomach is\r\nproduced from defective association, as in sea-sickness; or in the sickness\r\nwhich occurs, when a stone stimulates the ureter; no torpor is then\r\ncommunicated to the heart and arteries. For in the former case there is no\r\naccumulation of sensorial power in the stomach, which was previously\r\nexhausted by too great stimulus; but in the latter case the accumulation of\r\nsensorial power in the stomach during its torpor is evinced by this\r\ncircumstance; that in sea-sickness the patients eat and drink voraciously\r\nat intervals; and the pulse is generally not affected by the sickness\r\noccasioned by a stone in the ureter. For the action of the stomach is then\r\nlessened, and in consequence becomes retrograde, not owing to the\r\nexhaustion of the sensorial power of irritation, but to the want of\r\nexcitement of the sensorial power of association; which is caused by the\r\ndefective action of the ureter, which becomes occasionally torpid by the\r\ngreat stimulus of the stone it contains; or which is caused by the great\r\nexhaustion of sensorial power by the pain; which affects the ureter without\r\nexciting inflammation, or increased action of it.\r\n\r\n9. Thus though the stomach after the great stimulus of intoxication from\r\nexcess of wine or opium will continue many hours without accumulation of\r\nsensorial power, as appears from the patient's experiencing no appetite at\r\nthe intervals of sickness; yet after long abstinence from food, at length\r\nnot only the exhausted quantity of sensorial power is renewed, but an\r\naccumulation of it at length occurs, and hunger returns. In this situation\r\nthe stomach is generally about a whole day before it regains its usual\r\npowers of digestion; but if it has been still more violently stimulated,\r\nand its actions further impaired, a still more permanent torpor along with\r\na continued fever with weak pulse is liable to occur; and a fourth part, or\r\na half, or three fourths, or a whole lunar period passes, before it\r\nrecovers its due irritability and consequent action.\r\n\r\nIn similar manner, after a person has been confined in a very warm room for\r\nsome hours, the cutaneous capillaries, with their secretory and absorbent\r\nvessels, become exhausted of their sensorial power of irritation by the too\r\ngreat violent exertions occasioned by the unusual stimulus of heat; and in\r\ncoming into a colder atmosphere an inactivity of the cutaneous vessels\r\nexists at first for some time without accumulation of sensorial power; as\r\nis shewn by the continuance of the pain of cold and the paleness; but after\r\na time both the pain of cold and paleness vanish, which now indicates an\r\naccumulation of the sensorial power of irritation, as less degrees of heat\r\nstimulate the system into due action.\r\n\r\nIn the same manner, after any one has been some time in the summer\r\nsunshine, on coming into a dark cell he continues much longer before he can\r\nclearly distinguish objects, than if his eyes had only been previously\r\nexposed to the light of a cloudy day in winter; because the sensorial power\r\nof irritation, and consequent sensation, had in the first case been\r\npreviously much expended or exhausted; and therefore required a much longer\r\ntime before it could be produced in the brain, or derived to the optic\r\nnerves, in such quantity as to restore the deficiency, and to cause an\r\naccumulation of it; whereas in the latter case no deficiency had occurred.\r\n\r\n10. Thus the accumulation or deficiency of sensorial power in a torpid\r\norgan, which had previously been accustomed to perpetual action, depends on\r\nthe manner in which it becomes torpid; that is, whether by great previous\r\nstimulus, or great previous excitement of the power of association; or by\r\ndefect of its accustomed stimulus, or of its accustomed excitement of the\r\npower of association. In the former case the sensorial power is in an\r\nexhausted state, and therefore is not likely to become so soon accumulated,\r\nas after drunkenness, or exposure to great heat, or to great light; in the\r\nlatter a great accumulation of sensorial power occurs, as after exposure to\r\ncold, or hunger, or darkness.\r\n\r\nHence when the stomach continues torpid by previous violent stimulus, as in\r\nthe exhibition of digitalis, no accumulation of sensorial power of\r\nirritation supervenes; and in consequence the motions of the heart and\r\narteries, which are associated with those of the stomach, become weak, and\r\nslow, and intermittent, from the defect of the excitement of the sensorial\r\npower of association. But what follows? as the actions of the heart and\r\narteries are lessened by the deficient action of the sensorial power of\r\nassociation, and not by previous increased excitement of it; a great\r\naccumulation of the sensorial power of association occurs, which is exerted\r\non the pulmonary and cutaneous absorbents by reverse sympathy, and produces\r\na great absorption of the fluid effused into the cellular membrane in\r\nanasarca, with dry skin; constituting one kind of atrophy.\r\n\r\nBut if at the same time the secerning vessels of the stomach are stimulated\r\ninto so violent activity as to induce great consequent torpor, as probably\r\nhappens when contagious matter is swallowed into the stomach with our\r\nsaliva, those of the heart and arteries act feebly from the deficient\r\nexcitement of the power of association; and then the cutaneous and\r\npulmonary secerning vessels act with greater force than natural, owing to\r\nthe accumulation of the sensorial power of association; and unnatural heat\r\nof the skin, and of the breath succeed; but without frequency of pulse,\r\nconstituting the paresis irritativa of Class I. 2. 1. 2. And lastly, if a\r\npaucity of blood attends this paresis, or some other cause inducing a\r\nfrequency of pulse, the febris inirritativa, or fever with weak pulse, is\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nBut on the contrary when the stomach has previously been rendered torpid by\r\ndefect of stimulus, as by hunger, if food be too hastily supplied, not only\r\ngreat exertion of the stomach itself succeeds, but fever with strong pulse\r\nis induced in consequence; that is, the heart and arteries are excited into\r\nmore energetic action by the excess of the power of association, which\r\ncatenates their motions with those of the stomach. For the redundancy of\r\nsensorial power of irritation, which was accumulated during the inactivity\r\nof the stomach, and is now called into action by stimulus, actuates that\r\norgan with increased energy, and excites by these increased motions the\r\nsensorial power of association; which has also been accumulated during the\r\ninactivity of the heart and arteries; and thus these organs also are now\r\nexcited into greater action.\r\n\r\nSo after the skin has been exposed some hours to greater heat than natural\r\nin the warm room, other parts, as the membranes of the nostrils, or of the\r\nlungs, or of the stomach, are liable to become torpid from direct sympathy\r\nwith it, when we come into air of a moderate temperature; whence catarrhs,\r\ncoughs, and fevers. But if this torpor be occasioned by defect of stimulus,\r\nas after being exposed to frosty air, the accumulation of sensorial power\r\nis exerted, and a glow of the skin follows, with increased digestion, full\r\nrespiration, and more vigorous circulation.\r\n\r\n11. It may be asked, Why is there a great and constant accumulation of the\r\nsensorial power of association, owing to the torpor of the stomach and\r\nheart and arteries, in continued fever with weak pulse; which is exerted on\r\nthe cutaneous and pulmonary capillaries, so as to excite them into\r\nincreased action for many weeks, and yet no such exuberance of sensorial\r\npower produces fever in winter-sleeping animals, or in chlorosis, or\r\napepsia, or hysteria?\r\n\r\nIn winter-sleeping animals I suppose the whole nervous system is torpid, or\r\nparalysed, as in the sleep of frozen people; and that the stomach is torpid\r\nin consequence of the inactivity or quiescence of the brain; and that all\r\nother parts of the body, and the cutaneous capillaries with the rest,\r\nlabour under a similar torpor.\r\n\r\nIn chlorosis, I imagine, the actions of the heart and arteries, as well as\r\nthose of the cutaneous and pulmonary capillaries, suffer along with those\r\nof the stomach from the deficient stimulus of the pale blood; and that\r\nthough the liver is probably the seat of the original torpor in this\r\ndisease, with which all other parts sympathize from defect of the\r\nexcitation of the sensorial power of association; yet as this torpor occurs\r\nin so small a degree as not to excite a shuddering or cold fit, no\r\nobservable consequences are in general occasioned by the consequent\r\naccumulation of sensorial power. Sometimes indeed in chlorosis there does\r\noccur a frequent pulse and hot skin; in which circumstances I suppose the\r\nheart and arteries are become in some degree torpid by direct sympathy with\r\nthe torpid liver; and that hence not only the pulse becomes frequent, but\r\nthe capillaries of the skin act more violently by reverse sympathy with the\r\nheart and arteries, owing to the accumulation of the sensorial power of\r\nassociation in them during their torpid state, as occurs in irritative\r\nfever. See Article 11 of this Supplement.\r\n\r\nIn apepsia chronica the actions of the stomach are not so far impaired or\r\ndestroyed as totally to prevent the excitation of the sensorial power of\r\nassociation, which therefore contributes something towards the actions of\r\nthe heart and arteries, though less than natural, as a weak pulse always I\r\nbelieve attends this disease.\r\n\r\nThere is a torpor of the stomach, and of the upper part of the alimentary\r\ncanal in hysteria, as is evident from the retrograde actions of the\r\nduodenum, stomach, and oesophagus, which constitute the globus hystericus,\r\nor sensation of a globe rising into the throat. But as these retrograde\r\nactions are less than those, which induce sickness or vomiting, and are not\r\noccasioned by previous exhaustion of the sensorial power of irritation,\r\nthey do not so totally prevent the excitement of the sensorial power of\r\nassociation, as to lessen the motion of the heart and arteries so much as\r\nto induce fever; yet in this case, as in apepsia, and in chlorosis, the\r\npulsations of the heart and arteries are weaker than natural, and are\r\nsometimes attended with occasionally increased action of the capillaries;\r\nas appears from the flushings of the face, and hot skin, which generally\r\nform an evening febricula in diseases attended with weak digestion.\r\n\r\n12. The increased action, or orgasm, of the cutaneous, pulmonary, and\r\ncellular capillaries, with their secerning and absorbent vessels, in those\r\nfevers which are attended with deficiency of vital action, exhausts the\r\npatient both by the additional expenditure of sensorial power on those\r\norgans of secretion, and by the too great absorption of the mucus and fat\r\nof the body; whence great debility and great emaciation. Hence one great\r\nindication of cure of continued fever with arterial debility is to diminish\r\nthe too great action of the capillaries; which is to be done by frequent\r\nablutions, or bathing the whole skin in tepid or in cold water, as\r\nrecommended by Dr. Currie of Liverpool (Philos. Trans. for 1792), for half\r\nan hour, twice a day, or at those times when the skin feels dryest and\r\nhottest. Much cool air should also be admitted, when the breath of the\r\npatient feels hot to one's hand; or when the tongue, especially its middle\r\npart, is dry, and covered with a crust of indurated mucus; as these\r\nindicate the increased action of the pulmonary capillaries; in the same\r\nmanner as the dry and hot skin indicates the orgasm of the cutaneous\r\ncapillaries; and the emaciation of the body that of the cellular ones.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose of abating the action of the capillaries by frequent\r\nablution or fomentation, water of any degree of heat beneath that of the\r\nbody will be of service, and ought in accurate language to be called a cold\r\nbath; but the degree of coldness, where the patient is sensible, should in\r\nsome measure be governed by his sensations; as it is probable, that the\r\ndegree of coldness, which is most grateful to him, will also be of the\r\ngreatest benefit to him. See Class III. 2. 1. 12. and Article 15 of this\r\nSupplement.\r\n\r\nAnother great use of frequent ablutions, or fomentations, or baths, in\r\nfevers, where the stomach is in some degree torpid, is to supply the system\r\nwith aqueous fluid by means of the cutaneous absorbents; which is\r\ndissipated faster by the increased action of the secerning capillaries,\r\nthan the stomach can furnish, and occasions great thirst at the intervals\r\nof the sickness.\r\n\r\nIX. _Torpor of the Lungs._\r\n\r\n1. The lungs in many cases of contagion may first be affected with torpor,\r\nand the skin become cold by sympathy; in the same manner as a cold skin on\r\ngoing into the cold bath induces difficulty of breathing. Or the stomach\r\nmay become affected with torpor by its sympathy with the lungs, as in the\r\nexperiments of Mr. Watt with hydro-carbonate gas; a few respirations of\r\nwhich induced sickness, and even syncope. When the stomach or skin is thus\r\naffected secondarily by association, an accumulation of sensorial power\r\noccurs much sooner, than when these parts become torpid in consequence of\r\nprevious excess of stimulus; and hence they sooner recover their accustomed\r\naction, and the fever ceases. The particles of contagious matter thus\r\nreceived by respiration somewhat resemble in their effects the acid gases\r\nfrom burning sulphur, or from charcoal; which, if they do not instantly\r\ndestroy, induce a fever, and the patient slowly recovers.\r\n\r\n2. I was some years ago stooping down to look, which way the water oozed\r\nfrom a morass, as a labourer opened it with a spade, to detect the source\r\nof the spring, and inhaled a vapour, which occasioned an instant sense of\r\nsuffocation. Immediately recoiling I believe I inhaled it but once; yet a\r\nfew hours afterwards in the cool of the evening, when I returned home\r\nrather fatigued and hungry, a shivering and cold fit occurred, which was\r\nfollowed by a hot one; and the whole disease began and terminated in about\r\ntwelve hours without return. In this case the power of fear, or of\r\nimagination, was not concerned; as I neither thought of the bad air of a\r\nmorass before I perceived it; nor expected a fever-fit, till it occurred.\r\n\r\nIn this case the torpor commenced in the lungs, and after a few hours, by\r\nthe addition of fatigue, and cold, and hunger, was propagated by direct\r\nsympathy to the rest of the system. An orgasm or increased action of the\r\nwhole system was then induced by the accumulation of sensorial power of\r\nirritation in the lungs, and of association in the other organs; and when\r\nthese subsided, the disease ceased. It may be asked, could a torpor of the\r\ncapillaries of the air-vessels of the lungs be so suddenly produced by\r\ngreat stimulation?--It appears probable, that it might, because great\r\nexertion of irritative motions may be instantly produced without our\r\nperceiving them; that is, without their being attended by sensation, both\r\nin the lungs and stomach; and the organs may become torpid by the great\r\nexpenditure of the sensorial power of irritation in an instant of time; as\r\nparalysis frequently instantly follows too great an exertion of voluntary\r\npower.\r\n\r\n3. When the capillaries of the lungs act too violently, as in some\r\ncontinued fevers; which is known by the heat of the breath, and by the\r\ndryness of the tongue, especially of the middle part of it; not only cooler\r\nair might be admitted more freely into a sick room to counteract this\r\norgasm of the pulmonary capillaries; but perhaps the patient might breathe\r\nwith advantage a mixture of carbonic acid gas, or of hydrogene gas, or of\r\nazote with atmospheric air. And on the contrary, when there exists an\r\nevident torpor of the pulmonary capillaries, which may be known by the\r\ncorrespondent chilness of the skin; and by a tickling cough, which\r\nsometimes attends cold paroxysms of fever, and is then owing to the\r\ndeficient absorption of the pulmonary mucus, the saline parts of which\r\nstimulate the bronchiæ, or air-vessels; a mixture of one part of oxygen gas\r\nwith 10 or 20 parts of atmospheric air might probably be breathed with\r\ngreat advantage.\r\n\r\nX. _Torpor of the Brain._\r\n\r\nAs the inactivity or torpor of the absorbent vessels of the brain is the\r\ncause of hydrocephalus internus; and as the deficiency of venous absorption\r\nin the brain, or torpor of the extremities of its veins, is believed\r\nfrequently to be the cause of apoplexies; so there is reason to conclude,\r\nthat the torpor of the secerning vessels of the brain, which are supposed\r\nto produce the sensorial power, may constitute the immediate cause of some\r\nfevers with arterial debility. And also that the increased action of these\r\nsecerning vessels may sometimes constitute the immediate cause of fevers\r\nwith arterial strength.\r\n\r\nIt is nevertheless probable, that the torpor or orgasm of the sanguiferous,\r\nabsorbent, or secerning vessels of the brain may frequently exist as a\r\nsecondary effect, owing to their association with other organs, as the\r\nstomach or lungs; and may thus be produced like the torpor of the heart and\r\narteries in inirritative fevers, or like the orgasm of those organs in\r\nirritative fevers, or inflammatory ones.\r\n\r\nWhere there exists a torpor of the brain, might not very slight electric\r\nshocks passed frequently through it in all directions be used with\r\nadvantage? Might not fomentations of 94 or 96 degrees of heat on the head\r\nfor an hour at a time, and frequently repeated, stimulate the brain into\r\naction; as in the revival of winter-sleeping animals by warmth? Ether\r\nexternally might be frequently applied, and a blister on the shaved head.\r\n\r\nWhere the secerning vessels of the brain act with too great energy, as in\r\nsome inflammatory fevers, might it not be diminished by laying the patient\r\nhorizontally on a mill-stone, and whirling him, till sleep should be\r\nproduced, as the brain becomes compressed by the centrifugal force? See\r\nArticle 15 of this Supplement.\r\n\r\nXI. _Torpor of the Heart and Arteries._\r\n\r\n1. It was shewn in Class IV. 1. 1. 6. in IV. 2. 1. 2. and in Suppl. I. 6.\r\n3. that a reverse sympathy generally exists between the lacteal and\r\nlymphatic branches of the absorbent system. Hence, when the motions of the\r\nabsorbents of the stomach are rendered torpid or retrograde in fevers with\r\narterial debility, those of the skin, lungs, and cellular membrane, act\r\nwith increased energy. But the actions of the muscular fibres of the heart\r\nand arteries are at the same time associated with those of the muscular\r\nfibres of the stomach by direct sympathy. Both these actions occur during\r\nthe operation of powerful emetics, as squill, or digitalis; while the\r\nmotions of the stomach continue torpid or retrograde, the cellular and\r\ncutaneous absorbents act with greater energy, and the pulsations of the\r\nheart and arteries become weaker, and sometimes slower.\r\n\r\n2. The increased action of the stomach after a meal, and of the heart and\r\narteries at the same time from the stimulus of the new supply of chyle,\r\nseems originally to have produced, and to have established, this direct\r\nsympathy between them. As the increased action of the absorbents of the\r\nstomach after a meal has been usually attended with diminished action of\r\nthe other branches of the absorbent system, as mentioned in Class IV. 1. 1.\r\n6. and has thus established a reverse sympathy between them.\r\n\r\n2. Besides the reverse sympathy of the absorbent vessels and the muscles of\r\nthe stomach, and of the heart and arteries, with those of the skin, lungs,\r\nand cellular membrane; there exists a similar reverse sympathy between the\r\nsecerning vessels or glands of the former of these organs with those of the\r\nlatter; that is the mucous glands of the heart and arteries act generally\r\nby direct sympathy with those of the stomach; and the mucous glands of the\r\ncellular membrane of the lungs, and of the skin, act by reverse sympathy\r\nwith them both.\r\n\r\nHence when the stomach is torpid, as in sickness, this torpor sometimes\r\nonly affects the absorbent vessels of it; and then the absorbents of the\r\ncellular membrane and the skin only act with increased energy by reverse\r\nsympathy. If the torpor affects the muscular fibres of the stomach, those\r\nof the heart and arteries act by direct sympathy with it, and a weak pulse\r\nis produced, as in the exhibition of digitalis, but without increase of\r\nheat. But if the torpor also affects the glands of the stomach, the\r\ncutaneous and pulmonary glands act with greater energy by their reverse\r\nsympathy with those of the stomach, and of the heart and arteries; and\r\ngreat heat is produced along with increased perspiration both from the skin\r\nand lungs.\r\n\r\n3. There is some difficulty in explaining, why the actions of the extensive\r\nsystem of capillary glands, which exist on every other membrane and cell in\r\nthe body for the purpose of secreting mucus and perspirable matter, should\r\nso generally act by reverse sympathy with those of the stomach and upper\r\npart of the intestines. It was shewn in Class IV. 1. 1. 6. that when the\r\nstomach was filled with solid and fluid aliment, the absorbents of the\r\ncellular membrane, and of the bladder, and of the skin acted with less\r\nenergy; as the fluids they were used to absorb and transmit into the\r\ncirculation, were now less wanted; and that hence by habit a reverse\r\nsympathy obtained between these branches of the absorbents of the\r\nalimentary canal, and those of the other parts of the body.\r\n\r\nNow, as at this time less fluid was absorbed by the cutaneous and cellular\r\nlymphatics, it would happen, that less would be secreted by their\r\ncorrespondent secerning vessels, or capillary glands; and that hence by\r\nhabit, these secerning vessels would acquire a reverse sympathy of action\r\nwith the secerning vessels of the alimentary canal.\r\n\r\nThus when the absorption of the tears by the puncta lacrymalia is much\r\nincreased by the stimulus of snuff; or of an affecting idea, on the nasal\r\ndusts, as explained in Sect. XVI. 8. 2. a great increase of the secretion\r\nof tears from the lacrymal glands is produced by the direct sympathy of the\r\naction of these glands with those of their correspondent absorbents; and\r\nthat though in this case they are placed at so great a distance from each\r\nother.\r\n\r\n4. A difficult question here occurs; why does it happen, that in fevers\r\nwith weak pulse the contractions of the heart and arteries become at the\r\nsame time more frequent; which also sometimes occurs in chlorosis, and in\r\nsome hysteric and hypochondriac diseases, and in some insanities; yet at\r\nother times the weak pulse becomes at the same time slow, as in the\r\nexhibition of digitalis, and in paresis irritativa, described in Class I.\r\n2. 1. 2. which may be termed a fever with slow pulse? this frequency of\r\npulse can not depend on heat, because it sometimes exists without heat, as\r\ntowards the end of some fevers with debility.\r\n\r\nNow as apoplexies, which are sometimes ascribed to fulness of blood, are\r\nattended with slow pulse; and as in animals dying in the slaughter house\r\nfrom deficiency of blood the pulse becomes frequent in extreme; may not the\r\nfrequency of pulse in fevers with arterial debility be in general owing to\r\npaucity of blood? as explained in Sect. XXXII. 2. 3. and its slowness in\r\nparesis irritativa be caused by the debility being accompanied with due\r\nquantity of blood? or may not the former circumstance sometimes depend on a\r\nconcomitant affection of the brain approaching to sleep? or to the unusual\r\nfacility of the passage of the blood through the pulmonary and aortal\r\ncapillaries? in which circumstance the heart may completely empty itself at\r\neach pulsation, though its contractions may be weak. While the latter\r\ndepends on the difficulty of the passage of the blood through the pulmonary\r\nor aortal capillaries, as in the cold fits of intermittents, and in some\r\npalpitations of the heart, and in some kinds of hæmoptoe? in these cases\r\nthe increased resistance prevents the heart from emptying itself, and in\r\nconsequence a new diastole sooner occurs, and thus the number of pulsations\r\nbecomes greater in a given time.\r\n\r\n5. In respect to the sympathies of action, which produce or constitute\r\nfever with debility, the system may be divided into certain provinces,\r\nwhich are assentient or opposite to each other. First, the lacteals or\r\nabsorbent vessels of the stomach, and upper part of the intestines;\r\nsecondly, the lymphatics or all the other branches of the absorbent\r\nvessels, which arise from the skin, mucous membranes, cellular membranes,\r\nand the various glands. These two divisions act by reverse sympathy with\r\neach other in the hot fits of fever with debility, though by direct\r\nsympathy in the cold ones. The third division consists of the secerning\r\nvessels of the stomach and upper intestines; and the fourth of the\r\nsecerning vessels of all the other parts of the body, as the capillary\r\nglands of the skin, lungs, and cellular membrane, and the various other\r\nglands belonging to the sanguiferous system. Many of these frequently, but\r\nthe capillaries always, act by reverse sympathy with those of the third\r\ndivision above mentioned in the hot fits of fever with debility, though by\r\ndirect sympathy with them in the cold fits. Fifthly, the muscular fibres of\r\nthe stomach, and upper intestines; and sixthly, the muscular fibres of the\r\nheart and arteries. The actions of these two last divisions of moving\r\nfibres act by direct sympathy with each other, both in the cold and hot\r\nfits of fevers with debility.\r\n\r\nThe efficient cause of those apparent sympathies in fevers with weak pulse\r\nmay be thus understood. In the cold paroxysm of fever with weak pulse the\r\npart first affected I believe to be the stomach, and that it has become\r\ntorpid by previous violent exertion, as by swallowing contagious matter\r\nmixed with saliva, and not by defect of stimulus, as from cold or hunger.\r\nThe actions of this important organ, which sympathizes with almost every\r\npart of the body, being thus much diminished or nearly destroyed, the\r\nsensorial power of association is not excited; which in health contributes\r\nto move the heart and arteries, and all the rest of the system; whence an\r\nuniversal torpor occurs.\r\n\r\nWhen the hot fit approaches, the stomach in fevers with strong pulse\r\nregains its activity by the accumulation of the sensorial power of either\r\nirritation, if it was the part first affected, or of association if it was\r\naffected in sympathy with some other torpid part, as the spleen or liver;\r\nwhich accumulation is produced during its torpor. At the same time all the\r\nother parts of the system acquire greater energy of action by the\r\naccumulation of the sensorial power of association, which was produced,\r\nduring their inactivity in the cold fit.\r\n\r\nBut in fevers with weak pulse the stomach, whose sensorial power of\r\nirritation had been previously exhausted by violent action, acquires no\r\nsuch quick accumulation of sensorial power, but remains in a state of\r\ntorpor after the hot fit commences. The heart and arteries remain also in a\r\nstate of torpor, because there continues to be no excitement of their power\r\nof association owing to the torpid motions of the stomach; but hence it\r\nhappens, that there exists at this time a great accumulation of the power\r\nof association in the less active fibres of the heart and arteries; which,\r\nas it is not excited and expended by them, increases the associability of\r\nthe next link of the associated chain of motions, which consists of the\r\ncapillaries or other glands; and that in so great a degree as to actuate\r\nthem with unnatural energy, and thus to produce a perpetual hot fit of\r\nfever. Because the associability of the capillaries is so much increased by\r\nthe accumulation of this power, owing to the lessened activity of the heart\r\nand arteries, as to over-balance the lessened excitement of it by the\r\nweaker movements of the heart and arteries.\r\n\r\n6. When the accumulation of the sensorial power of irritation caused by\r\ndefect of stimulus is greater in the first link of a train of actions, to\r\nwhich associated motions are catenated, than the deficiency of the\r\nexcitement of the sensorial power of association in the next link, what\r\nhappens?--the superabundance of the unemployed sensorial power of the first\r\nlink is derived to the second; the associability of which thus becomes so\r\ngreatly increased, that it acts more violently than natural, though the\r\nexcitement of its power of association by the lessened action of the first\r\nlink is less than natural. So that in this situation the withdrawing of an\r\naccustomed stimulus in some parts of the system will decrease the\r\nirritative motions of that part, and at the same time occasion an increase\r\nof the associate motion of another part, which is catenated with it.\r\n\r\nThis circumstance nevertheless can only occur in those parts of the system,\r\nwhose natural actions are perpetual, and the accumulation of sensorial\r\npower on that account very great, when their activity is much lessened by\r\nthe deduction of their usual stimulus; and are therefore only to be found\r\nin the sanguiferous system, or in the alimentary canal, or in the glands\r\nand capillaries. Of the first of which the following is an instance.\r\n\r\nThe respiration of a reduced atmosphere, that is of air mixed with\r\nhydrogene or azote, quickens the pulse, as observed in the case of Mrs.\r\nEaton by Dr. Reynolds and Dr. Thornton; to which Dr. Beddoes adds in a\r\nnote, that \"he never saw an instance in which a lowered atmosphere did not\r\nat the moment quicken the pulse, while it weakened the action of the heart\r\nand arteries.\" Considerations on Factitious Airs, by Thomas Beddoes and\r\nJames Watt, Part III. p. 67. Johnson, London. By the assistance of this new\r\nfact the curious circumstance of the quick production of warmth of the skin\r\non covering the head under the bed-clothes, which every one must at some\r\ntime have experienced, receives a more satisfactory explanation, than that\r\nwhich is given in Class IV. 1. 1. 2. which was printed before this part of\r\nDr. Beddoes's Considerations was published.\r\n\r\nFor if the blood be deprived of its accustomed quantity of oxygen, as in\r\ncovering the head in bed, and thus breathing an air rendered impure by\r\nrepeated respiration, or by breathing a factitious air with less proportion\r\nof oxygen, which in common respiration passes through the moist membranes\r\nof the lungs, and mixes with the blood, the pulsations of the heart and\r\narteries become weaker, and consequently quicker, by the defect of the\r\nstimulus of oxygen. And as these vessels are subject to perpetual motion,\r\nthe accumulation of the sensorial power of irritation becomes so great by\r\ntheir lessened activity, that it excites the vessels next connected, the\r\ncutaneous capillaries for instance, into more energetic actions, so as to\r\nproduce increased heat of the skin, and greater perspiration.\r\n\r\nHow exactly this resembles a continued fever with weak and quick pulse!--in\r\nthe latter the action of the heart and arteries are lessened by defect of\r\nthe excitement of the sensorial power of association, owing to the torpor\r\nor lessened actions of the stomach; hence the accumulation of the sensorial\r\npower of association in this case, as the accumulation of that of\r\nirritation in the former, becomes so abundant as to excite into increased\r\naction the parts most nearly connected, as the cutaneous capillaries.\r\n\r\nIn respect to the circumstance mentioned by Sydenham, that covering the\r\nhead in bed in a short time relieved the pertinacious sickness of the\r\npatient, it must be observed, that when the action of the heart and\r\narteries become weakened by the want of the due stimulus of the proper\r\nquantity of oxygen in the blood, that an accumulation of the sensorial\r\npower of irritation occurs in the fibres of the heart and arteries, which\r\nthen is expended on those of the capillary glands, increasing their actions\r\nand consequent secretions and heat. And then the stomach is thrown into\r\nstronger action, both by the greater excitement of its natural quantity of\r\nthe sensorial power of association by the increased actions of the\r\ncapillaries, and also by some increase of associability, as it had been\r\npreviously a long time in a state of torpor, or less activity than natural,\r\nas evinced by its perpetual sickness.\r\n\r\nIn a manner somewhat similar to this, is the redness of the skin produced\r\nin angry people by the superabundance of the unemployed sensorial power of\r\nvolition, as explained in Class IV. 2. 3. 5. Rubor ex irâ. From hence we\r\nlearn how, when people in fevers with weak pulse, or in dropsies, become\r\ninsane, the abundance of the unemployed sensorial power of volition\r\nincreases the actions of the whole moving system, and cures those diseases.\r\n\r\n7. As the orgasm of the capillaries in fevers with weak pulse is\r\nimmediately caused by the torpid actions of the heart and arteries, as\r\nabove explained, this supplies us with another indication of cure in such\r\nfevers, and that is to stimulate these organs. This may probably be done by\r\nsome kind of medicines, which are known to pass into the blood unchanged in\r\nsome of their properties. It is possible that nitre, or its acid, may pass\r\ninto the blood and increase the colour of it, and thus increase its\r\nstimulus, and the same may be supposed of other salts, neutral or metallic?\r\nAs rubia tinctoria, madder, colours the bones of young animals, it must\r\npass into the blood with its colouring matter at least unchanged, and\r\nperhaps many other medicines may likewise affect the blood, and thus act by\r\nstimulating the heart and arteries, as well as by stimulating the stomach;\r\nwhich circumstance deserves further attention.\r\n\r\nAnother way of immediately stimulating the heart and arteries would be by\r\ntransfusing new blood into them. Is it possible that any other fluid\r\nbesides blood, as chyle, or milk, or water, could, if managed with great\r\nart, be introduced safely or advantageously into the vein of a living\r\nanimal?\r\n\r\nA third method of exciting the heart and arteries immediately is by\r\nincreasing the natural stimulus of the blood, and is well worthy experiment\r\nin all fevers with weak pulse; and that consists in supplying the blood\r\nwith a greater proportion of oxygen; which may be done by respiration, if\r\nthe patient was to breathe either oxygen gas pure, or diluted with\r\natmospheric air, which might be given to many gallons frequently in a day,\r\nand by passing through the moist membranes of the lungs, according to the\r\nexperiments of Dr. Priestley, and uniting with the blood, might render it\r\nmore stimulant, and thus excite the heart and arteries into greater action!\r\nMay not some easier method of exhibiting oxygen gas by respiration be\r\ndiscovered, as by using very small quantities of hyper-oxygenated marine\r\nacid gas very much diluted with atmospheric air?\r\n\r\nXII. _Torpor of the Stomach and upper Intestines._\r\n\r\n1. The principal circumstance, which supports the increased action of the\r\ncapillaries in continued fever with weak pulse, is their reverse sympathy\r\nwith those of the stomach and upper intestines, or with those of the heart\r\nand arteries. The torpor of the stomach and upper intestines is apparent in\r\ncontinued fevers from the total want of appetite for solid food, besides\r\nthe sickness with which fevers generally commence, and the frequent\r\ndiarrhoea with indigested stools, at the same time the thirst of the\r\npatient is sometimes urgent at the intervals of the sickness. Why the\r\nstomach can at this time take fluids by intervals, and not solids, is\r\ndifficult to explain; except it be supposed, as some have affirmed, that\r\nthe lacteal absorbents are a different branch from the lymphatic\r\nabsorbents, and that in this case the former only are in a state of\r\npermanent torpor.\r\n\r\n2. The torpor of the heart and arteries is known by the weakness of the\r\npulse. When the actions of the absorbents of the stomach are diminished by\r\nthe exhibition of small doses of digitalis, or become retrograde by larger\r\nones, the heart and arteries act more feebly by direct sympathy; but the\r\ncellular, cutaneous, and pulmonary absorbents are excited into greater\r\naction. Whence in anasarca the fluids in the cellular membrane throughout\r\nthe whole body are absorbed during the sickness, and frequently a great\r\nquantity of atmospheric moisture at the same time; as appears by the very\r\ngreat discharge of urine, which sometimes happens in these cases; and in\r\nileus the prodigious evacuations by vomiting, which are often a hundred\r\nfold greater than the quantity swallowed, evince the great action of all\r\nthe other absorbents during the sickness of the stomach.\r\n\r\n3. But when the stomach is rendered permanently sick by an emetic drug, as\r\nby digitalis, it is not probable, that much accumulation of sensorial power\r\nis soon produced in this organ; because its usual quantity of sensorial\r\npower is previously exhausted by the great stimulus of the foxglove; and\r\nhence it seems probable, that the great accumulation of sensorial power,\r\nwhich now causes the increased action of the absorbents, is produced in\r\nconsequence of the inactivity of the heart and arteries; which inactivity\r\nis induced by deficient excitement of the sensorial power of association\r\nbetween those organs and the stomach, and not by any previous exhaustion of\r\ntheir natural quantity of sensorial power; whereas in ileus, where the\r\ntorpor of the stomach, and consequent sickness, is induced by reverse\r\nsympathy with an inflamed intestine, that is, by dissevered or defective\r\nassociation; the accumulation of sensorial power, which in that disease so\r\nviolently actuates the cellular, pulmonary, and cutaneous absorbents, is\r\napparently produced by the torpor of the stomach and lacteals, and the\r\nconsequent accumulation of the sensorial power of association in them owing\r\nto their lessened action in sickness.\r\n\r\n4. This accounts for the dry skin in fevers with weak pulse, where the\r\nstomach and the heart and arteries are in a torpid state, and for the\r\nsudden emaciation of the body; because the actions of the cellular and\r\ncutaneous absorbents are increased by reverse sympathy with those of the\r\nstomach, or with those of the heart and arteries; that is by the\r\nexpenditure of that sensorial power of association, which is accumulated in\r\nconsequence of the torpor of the stomach and heart and arteries, or of\r\neither of them; this also explains the sudden absorption of the milk in\r\npuerperal fevers; and contributes along with the heat of the respired air\r\nto the dryness of the mucous membrane of the tongue and nostrils.\r\n\r\n5. Besides the reverse sympathy, with which the absorbent vessels of the\r\nstomach and upper intestines act in respect to all the other absorbent\r\nvessels, as in the exhibition of digitalis, and in ileus; there is another\r\nreverse sympathy exists between the capillaries, or secretory vessels of\r\nthe stomach, and those of the skin. Which may nevertheless be occasioned by\r\nthe accumulation of sensorial power by the torpor of the heart and\r\narteries, which is induced by direct sympathy with the stomach; thus when\r\nthe torpor of the stomach remains in a fever-fit which might otherwise have\r\nintermitted, the torpor of the heart and arteries remains also by direct\r\nsympathy, and the increased cutaneous capillary action, and consequent\r\nheat, are produced by reverse sympathy; and the fever is thus rendered\r\ncontinual, owing primarily to the torpor of the stomach.\r\n\r\n6. The reverse sympathy, which exists between the capillaries of the\r\nstomach and the cutaneous capillaries, appears by the chillness of some\r\npeople after dinner; and contrary-wise by the digestion being strengthened,\r\nwhen the skin is exposed to cold air for a short time; as mentioned in\r\nClass IV. 1. 1. 4. and IV. 2. 1. 1. and from the heat and glow on the skin,\r\nwhich attends the action of vomiting; for though when sickness first\r\ncommences, the skin is pale and cold; as it then partakes of the general\r\ntorpor, which induces the sickness; yet after the vomiting has continued\r\nsome minutes, so that an accumulation of sensorial power exists in the\r\ncapillaries of the stomach, and of the skin, owing to their diminished\r\naction; a glow of the skin succeeds, with sweat, as well as with increased\r\nabsorption.\r\n\r\n7. Nevertheless in some circumstances the stomach and the heart and\r\narteries seem to act by direct sympathy with the cutaneous capillaries, as\r\nin the flushing of the face and glow of the skin of some people after\r\ndinner; and as in fevers with strong pulse. In these cases there appears to\r\nbe an increased production of sensorial power, either of sensation, as in\r\nthe blush of shame; or of volition, as in the blush of anger; or of\r\nirritation, as in the flushed face after dinner above mentioned.\r\n\r\nThis increased action of the capillaries of the skin along with the\r\nincreased actions of the stomach and heart is perhaps to be esteemed a\r\nsynchronous increase of action, rather than a sympathy between those\r\norgans. Thus the flushing of the face after dinner may be owing to the\r\nsecretion of sensorial power in the brain being increased by the\r\nassociation of that organ with the stomach, in a greater proportion than\r\nthe increased expenditure of it, or may be owing also to the stimulus of\r\nnew chyle received into the blood.\r\n\r\n8. When the stomach and the heart and arteries are rendered torpid in\r\nfevers, not only the cutaneous, cellular, and pulmonary absorbents are\r\nexcited to act with greater energy; but also their correspondent\r\ncapillaries and secerning vessels or glands, especially perhaps those of\r\nthe skin, are induced into more energetic action. Whence greater heat, a\r\ngreater secretion of perspirable matter, and of mucus; and a greater\r\nabsorption of them both, and of aerial moisture. These reverse sympathies\r\ncoincide with other animal facts, as in eruption of small pox on the face\r\nand neck the feet become cold, while the face and neck are much flushed;\r\nand in the hemiplagia, when one arm and leg become disobedient to volition,\r\nthe patient is perpetually moving the other. Which are well accounted for\r\nby the accumulation of sensorial power in one part of an associated series\r\nof actions, when less of it is expended by another part of it; and by a\r\ndeficiency of sensorial power in the second link of association, when too\r\nmuch of it is expended by the first.\r\n\r\n9. This doctrine of reverse sympathy enables us to account for that\r\ndifficult problem, why in continued fevers the increased action of the\r\ncutaneous, cellular, and pulmonary capillaries proceeds without\r\ninterruption or return of cold fit; though perhaps with some exacerbations\r\nand remissions; and that during a quarter, or half, or three quarters, or a\r\nwhole lunation; while at the same time the pulsations of the heart and\r\narteries are weaker than natural.\r\n\r\nTo this should be added the direct sympathy, which exists between the\r\nperistaltic motions of the fibres of the stomach, and the pulsations of the\r\nheart. And that the stomach has become torpid by the too great stimulus of\r\nsome poisonous or contagious matter; and this very intricate idea of\r\ncontinued fever with feeble pulse is reduced to curious simplicity.\r\n\r\nThe direct sympathy of the stomach and heart and arteries not only appears\r\nfrom the stronger and slower pulse of persons exhausted by fatigue, after\r\nthey have drank a glass of wine, and eaten a few mouthfuls; but appears\r\nalso from the exhibition of large doses of digitalis; when the patient\r\nlabours under great and incessant efforts to vomit, at the same time that\r\nthe actions of the absorbent system are known to be much increased by the\r\nhasty absorption of the serous fluid in anasarca, the pulsations of the\r\nheart become slow and intermittent to an alarming degree. See Class IV. 2.\r\n1. 17. and 18.\r\n\r\n10. It would assist us much in the knowledge and cure of fevers, if we\r\ncould always determine, which part of the system was primarily affected;\r\nand whether the torpor of it was from previous excess or defect of\r\nstimulus; which the industry of future observers must discover. Thus if the\r\nstomach be affected primarily, and that by previous excess of stimulus, as\r\nwhen certain quantities of opium, or wine, or blue vitriol, or arsenic, are\r\nswallowed, it is some time in recovering the quantity of sensorial power\r\npreviously exhausted by excess of stimulus, before any accumulation of it\r\ncan occur. But if it be affected with torpor secondarily, by sympathy with\r\nsome distant part; as with the torpid capillaries of the skin, that is by\r\ndefective excitement of the sensorial power of association; or if it be\r\naffected by defect of stimulus of food or of heat; it sooner acquires so\r\nmuch accumulation of sensorial power, as to be enabled to accommodate\r\nitself to its lessened stimulus by increase of its irritability.\r\n\r\nThus in the hemicrania the torpor generally commences in a diseased tooth,\r\nand the membranes about the temple, and also those of the stomach become\r\ntorpid by direct synchronous sympathy; and pain of the head, and sickness\r\nsupervene; but no fever or quickness of pulse. In this case the torpor of\r\nthe stomach is owing to defect of the sensorial power of association, which\r\nis caused by the too feeble actions of the membranes surrounding the\r\ndiseased tooth, and thus the train of sympathy ceases here without\r\naffecting the motions of the heart and arteries; but where contagious\r\nmatter is swallowed into the stomach, the stomach after a time becomes\r\ntorpid from exhaustion of the sensorial power of irritation, and the heart\r\nand arteries act feebly from defect of the excitement of the power of\r\nassociation. In the former case the torpor of the stomach is conquered by\r\naccumulation of the power of association in one or two whole days; in the\r\nlatter it recovers by accumulation of the power of irritation in three or\r\nfour weeks.\r\n\r\nIn intermittent fevers the stomach is generally I believe affected\r\nsecondarily by sympathy with the torpid cutaneous capillaries, or with some\r\ninternal torpid viscus, and on this account an accumulation of sensorial\r\npower arises in a few hours sufficient to restore the natural irritability\r\nof this organ; and hence the hot fit succeeds, and the fever intermits. Or\r\nif this accumulation of sensorial power becomes excessive and permanent,\r\nthe continued fever with strong pulse is produced, or febris irritativa.\r\n\r\nIn continued fevers the stomach is frequently I suppose affected with\r\ntorpor by previous excess of stimulus, and consequent exhaustion of\r\nsensorial power, as when contagious matter is swallowed with the saliva,\r\nand it is then much slower in producing an accumulation of sensorial power\r\nsufficient to restore its healthy irritability; which is a frequent cause\r\nof continued fever with weak pulse or febris inirritativa. Which consists,\r\nafter the cold fit is over, in a more frequent and more feeble action of\r\nthe heart and arteries, owing to their direct sympathy with the muscular\r\nfibres of the torpid stomach; together with an increased action of the\r\ncapillaries, glands, and absorbents of the skin, and cellular membrane,\r\nowing to their reverse sympathy with the torpid capillaries, glands, and\r\nabsorbents of the stomach, or with those of the heart and arteries.\r\n\r\nOr in more accurate language. 1. The febris inirritativa, or fever with\r\nweak pulse, commences with torpor of the stomach, occasioned by previous\r\nexhaustion of sensorial power of irritation by the stimulus of contagious\r\nmatter swallowed with the saliva. 2. The whole system becomes torpid from\r\ndefect of the excitement or the sensorial power of association owing to the\r\ntoo feeble actions of the stomach, this is the cold fit. 3. The whole\r\nsystem, except the stomach with the upper intestines, and the heart and\r\narteries, falls into increased action, or orgasm, owing to accumulation of\r\nsensorial power of association during their previous torpor, this is the\r\nhot fit. 4. The stomach and upper intestines have not acquired their\r\nnatural quantity of sensorial power of irritation, which was previously\r\nexhausted by violent action in consequence of the stimulus of contagious\r\nmatter, and the heart and arteries remain torpid from deficient excitement\r\nof the sensorial power of association owing to the too feeble actions of\r\nthe stomach. 5. The accumulation of sensorial power of association in\r\nconsequence of the torpor of the heart and arteries occasions a perpetual\r\norgasm, or increased action of the capillaries.\r\n\r\n11. From hence it may be deducted first, that when the torpor of the\r\nstomach first occurs, either as a primary effect, or as a secondary link of\r\nsome associate train or circle of motions, a general torpor of the system\r\nsometimes accompanies it, which constitutes the cold fit of fever; at other\r\ntimes no such general torpor occurs, as during the operation of a weak\r\nemetic, or during sea-sickness.\r\n\r\nSecondly. After a time it generally happens, that a torpor of the stomach\r\nceases, and its actions are renewed with increase of vigour by accumulation\r\nof sensorial power during its quiescence; as after the operation of a weak\r\nemetic, or at the intervals of sea-sickness, or after the paroxysm of an\r\nintermittent fever.\r\n\r\nThirdly. The stomach is sometimes much slower in recovering from a previous\r\ntorpor, and is then the remote cause of continued fever with weak pulse;\r\nwhich is owing to a torpor of the heart and arteries, produced in\r\nconsequence of the deficient excitement of the power of association by the\r\ntoo weak actions of the stomach; and to an orgasm of the capillaries of the\r\nother parts of the system, in consequence of the accumulation of sensorial\r\npower occasioned by the inactivity of the heart and arteries.\r\n\r\nFourthly. The torpor of the stomach is sometimes so complete, that probably\r\nthe origin of its nerves is likewise affected, and then no accumulation of\r\nsensorial power occurs. In this case the patient dies for want of\r\nnourishment; either in three or four weeks, of the inirritative fever; or\r\nwithout quick pulse, by what we have called paresis irritativa. Or he\r\ncontinues many years in a state of total debility. When this torpor\r\nsuddenly commences, the patient generally suffers epileptic fits or\r\ntemporary insanity from the disagreeable sensation of so great a torpor of\r\nthe stomach; which also happens sometimes at the eruption of the distinct\r\nsmall pox; whence we have termed this disease anorexia epileptica. See\r\nClass II. 2. 2. 1. and III. 1. 1. 7. and Suppl. I. 14. 3.\r\n\r\nFifthly. When this torpor of the stomach is less in degree or extent, and\r\nyet without recovering its natural irritability by accumulation of\r\nsensorial power, as it does after the cold fit of intermittent fever, or\r\nafter the operation of mild emetics, or during syncope; a permanent defect\r\nof its activity, and of that of the upper intestines, remains, which\r\nconstitutes apepsia, cardialgia, hypochondriasis, and hysteria. See Class\r\nI. 3. 1. 3. and I. 2. 4. 5.\r\n\r\nSixthly. If the torpor of the stomach be induced by direct sympathy, as in\r\nconsequence of a previous torpor of the liver, or spleen, or skin, an\r\naccumulation of sensorial power will sooner be produced in the stomach;\r\nbecause there has been no previous expenditure of it, the present torpor of\r\nthe stomach arising from defect of association. Hence some fevers perfectly\r\nintermit, the stomach recovering its complete action after the torpor and\r\nconsequent orgasm, which constitute the paroxysm of fever, are terminated.\r\n\r\nSeventhly. If the torpor of the stomach be owing to defect of irritation,\r\nas to the want of food, an accumulation of sensorial power soon occurs with\r\nan increase of digestion, if food be timely applied; or with violent\r\ninflammation, if food be given in too great quantity after very long\r\nabstinence.\r\n\r\nEighthly. If the torpor of the stomach be induced by defect of pleasurable\r\nsensation, as when sickness is caused by the suggestion of nauseous ideas;\r\nan accumulation of sensorial power soon occurs, and the sickness ceases\r\nwith the return of hunger; for in this case the inactivity of the stomach\r\nis occasioned by the subduction of agreeable sensation, which acts as a\r\nsubduction of stimulus, and not by exhausting the natural quantity of\r\nsensorial power in the fibres or nerves of the stomach.\r\n\r\nNinthly. If the torpor of the stomach be induced by a twofold cause, as in\r\nsea-sickness. See Vertigo rotatoria. Class IV. 2. 1. 10. in which the first\r\nlink of association acts too strongly, and in consequence expends more than\r\nusual of the sensorial power of irritation; and secondly in which sensation\r\nis produced between the links of association, and dissevers or enfeebles\r\nthem; the accumulation of sensorial power soon occurs in the stomach; as no\r\nprevious expenditure of it in that organ has occurred. Whence in\r\nsea-sickness the persons take food with eagerness at times, when the\r\nvertigo eases for a few minutes.\r\n\r\nTenthly. If the gastric torpor be induced by previous violent exertion, as\r\nafter intoxication, or after contagious matter has been swallowed, or some\r\npoisons, as digitalis, or arsenic; an accumulation of sensorial power very\r\nslowly succeeds; whence long sickness, or continued fever, because the\r\nquantity of sensorial power already wasted must first be renewed, before an\r\naccumulation of it can be produced.\r\n\r\n12. This leads us to a second indication of cure in continued fevers, which\r\nconsists in strengthening the actions of the stomach; as the first\r\nindication consisted in decreasing the actions of the cutaneous capillaries\r\nand absorbents. The actions of the stomach may sometimes be increased by\r\nexhibiting a mild emetic; as an accumulation of sensorial power in the\r\nfibres of the stomach is produced during their retrograde actions. Besides\r\nthe evacuation of any noxious material from the stomach and duodenum, and\r\nfrom the absorbents, which open their mouths on their internal surfaces, by\r\ntheir retrograde motion.\r\n\r\nIt is probable, that when mild emetics are given, as ipecacuanha, or\r\nantimonium tartarizatum, or infusion of chamomile, they are rejected by an\r\ninverted motion of the stomach and oesophagus in consequence of\r\ndisagreeable sensation, as dust is excluded from the eye; and these actions\r\nhaving by previous habit been found effectual, and that hence there is no\r\nexhaustion of the sensorial power of irritation. But where strong emetics\r\nare administered, as digitalis, or contagious matter, the previous\r\nexhaustion of the sensorial power of irritation seems to be a cause of the\r\ncontinued retrograde actions and sickness of the stomach. An emetic of the\r\nformer kind may therefore strengthen the power of the stomach immediately\r\nafter its operation by the accumulation of sensorial power of irritation\r\nduring its action. See Class IV. 1. 1.\r\n\r\nAnother method of decreasing the action of the stomach for a time, and\r\nthence of increasing it afterwards, is by the accumulation of the sensorial\r\npower of irritation during its torpor; is by giving ice, iced water, iced\r\ncreams, or iced wine. This accounts for the pleasure, which many people in\r\nfevers with weak pulse express on drinking cold beverage of any kind.\r\n\r\nA second method of exciting the stomach into action, and of decreasing that\r\nof the capillaries in consequence, is by the stimulus of wine, opium, bark,\r\nmetallic salts of antimony, steel, copper, arsenic, given in small repeated\r\nquantities; which so long as they render the pulse slower are certainly of\r\nservice, and may be given warm or cold, as most agreeable to the patient.\r\nFor it is possible, that the capillaries of the stomach may act too\r\nviolently, and produce heat, at the same time that the large muscles of it\r\nmay be in a torpid state; which curious circumstance future observations\r\nmust determine.\r\n\r\nThirdly. Hot fomentation on the region of the stomach might be of most\r\nessential service by its stimulus, as heat penetrates the system not by the\r\nabsorbent vessels, but by external influence; whence the use of hot\r\nfomentation to the head in torpor of the brain; and the use of hot bath in\r\ncases of general debility, which has been much too frequently neglected\r\nfrom a popular error occasioned by the unmeaning application of the word\r\nrelaxation to animal power. If the fluid of heat could be directed to pass\r\nthrough particular parts of the body with as little diffusion of its\r\ninfluence, as that of electricity in the shocks from the coated jar, it\r\nmight be employed with still greater advantage.\r\n\r\nFourthly. The use of repeated small electric shocks through the region of\r\nthe stomach might be of service in fevers with weak pulse, and well\r\ndeserves a trial; twenty or thirty small shocks twice a day for a week or\r\ntwo would be a promising experiment.\r\n\r\nFifthly. A blister on the back, or sides, or on the pit of the stomach,\r\nrepeated in succession, by stimulating the skin frequently strengthens the\r\naction of the stomach by exciting the sensorial power of association; this\r\nespecially in those fevers where the skin of the extremities, as of the\r\nhands or nose or ears, sooner becomes cold, when exposed to the air, than\r\nusual.\r\n\r\nSixthly. The action of the stomach may be increased by preventing too great\r\nexpenditure of sensorial power in the link of previous motion with which it\r\nis catenated, especially if the action of that link be greater than\r\nnatural. Thus as the capillaries of the skin act too violently in fevers\r\nwith weak pulse, if these are exposed to cold air or cold water, the\r\nsensorial power, which previously occasioned their orgasm, becomes\r\naccumulated, and tends to increase the action of the stomach; thus in those\r\nfevers with weak pulse and hot skin, if the stomach be stimulated by\r\nrepeated small doses of bark and wine or opium, and be further excited at\r\nthe same time by accumulation of sensorial power occasioned by rendering\r\nthe capillaries torpid by cold air or water, this twofold application is\r\nfrequently attended with visible good effect.\r\n\r\nBy thus stimulating the torpid stomach into greater action, the motions of\r\nthe heart and arteries will likewise be increased by the greater excitement\r\nof the power of association. And the capillaries of the skin will cease to\r\nact so violently, from their not possessing so great a superfluity of\r\nsensorial power as during the greater quiescence of the stomach and of the\r\nheart and arteries. Which is in some circumstances similar to the curious\r\nphenomenon mentioned in Class IV. 2. 2. 10; where, by covering the chill\r\nfeet with flannel at the eruption of the small-pox, the points of the\r\nflannel stimulate the skin of the feet into greater action, and the\r\nquantity of heat, which they possess, is also confined, or insulated, and\r\nfurther increases by its stimulus the activity of the cutaneous vessels of\r\nthe feet; and by that circumstance abates the too great action of the\r\ncapillaries of the face, and the consequent heat of it.\r\n\r\nXIII. _Case of continued fever._\r\n\r\nThe following case of continued fever which I frequently saw during its\r\nprogress, as it is less complicate than usual, may illustrate this\r\ndoctrine. Master S. D. an active boy about eight years of age, had been\r\nmuch in the snow for many days, and sat in the classical school with wet\r\nfeet; he had also about a fortnight attended a writing school, where many\r\nchildren of the lower order were instructed. He was seized on February the\r\n8th, 1795, with great languor, and pain in his forehead, with vomiting and\r\nperpetual sickness; his pulse weak, but not very frequent. He took an\r\nemetic, and on the next day, had a blister, which checked the sickness only\r\nfor a few hours; his skin became perpetually hot, and dry; and his tongue\r\nwhite and furred; his pulse when asleep about 104 in a minute, and when\r\nawake about 112.\r\n\r\nFourth day of the disease. He has had another blister, the pain of his head\r\nis gone, but the sickness continues by intervals; he refuses to take any\r\nsolid food, and will drink nothing but milk, or milk and water, cold. He\r\nhas two or three very liquid stools every day, which are somtimes green,\r\nbut generally of a darkish yellow, with great flatulency both upwards and\r\ndownwards at those times. An antimonial powder was once given, but\r\ninstantly rejected; a spoonful of decoction of bark was also exhibited with\r\nthe same event. His legs are bathed, and his hands and face are moistened\r\ntwice a day for half an hour in warmish water, which is nevertheless much\r\ncolder than his skin.\r\n\r\nEighth day. His skin continues hot and dry without any observable\r\nremissions, with liquid stools and much flatulency and sickness; his water\r\nwhen observed was of a straw colour. He has asked for cyder, and drinks\r\nnearly a bottle a day mixed with cold water, and takes three drops of\r\nlaudanum twice a day.\r\n\r\nTwelfth day. He continues much the same, takes no milk, drinks only cyder\r\nand water, skin hot and dry, tongue hot and furred, with liquid stools, and\r\nsickness always at the same time; sleeps much.\r\n\r\nSixteenth day. Was apparently more torpid, and once rather delirious; pulse\r\n112. Takes only capillaire and water; sleeps much.\r\n\r\nTwentieth day. Pulse 100, skin dry but less hot, liquid stools not so\r\nfrequent, he is emaciated to a great degree, he has eaten half a tea-cup\r\nfull of custard to day, drinks only capillaire and water, has thrice taken\r\ntwo large spoonfuls of decoction of bark with three drops of laudanum,\r\nrefuses to have his legs bathed, and will now take nothing but three drops\r\nof laudanum twice a day.\r\n\r\nTwenty-fourth day. He has gradually taken more custard every day, and began\r\nto attend to some new play things, and takes wine syllabub.\r\n\r\nTwenty-eighth day. He daily grows stronger, eats eggs, and and butter, and\r\nsleeps immediately after his food, can creep on his hands and knees, but\r\ncannot stand erect.\r\n\r\nThirty-second day. He cannot yet stand alone safely, but seems hourly to\r\nimprove in strength of body, and activity of mind.\r\n\r\nIn this case the remote cause of his fever could not be well ascertained,\r\nas it might be from having his feet cold for many successive days, or from\r\ncontagion; but the latter seems more probable, because his younger brother\r\nbecame ill of a similar fever about three weeks afterwards, and probably\r\nreceived the infection from him. The disease commenced with great torpor of\r\nthe stomach, which was shewn by his total aversion to solid food, and\r\nperpetual sickness; the watery stools, which were sometimes green, or of a\r\ndarkish yellow, were owing to the acrimony, or acidity, of the contents of\r\nthe bowels; which as well as the flatulency were occasioned by indigestion.\r\nThis torpor of the stomach continued throughout the whole fever, and when\r\nit ceased, the fever ceased along with it.\r\n\r\nThe contagious material of this fever I suppose to have been mixed with the\r\nsaliva, and swallowed into the stomach; that it excited the vessels, which\r\nconstitute the stomach, into the greatest irritative motion like arsenic;\r\n_which might not be perceived, and yet might render that organ paralytic or\r\ninirritable in a moment of time_; as animals sometimes die by one single\r\nexertion, and consequent paralysis, without a second struggle; as by\r\nlightning, or being shot through the back part of the brain; of both which\r\nI have seen instances. I had once an opportunity of inspecting two oxen, a\r\nfew minutes after they were killed by lightning under a crab-tree on moist\r\nground in long grass; and observed, that they could not have struggled, as\r\nthe grass was not pressed or bent near them; I have also seen two horses\r\nshot through the cerebellum, who never once drew in their legs after they\r\nfirst stretched them out, but died instantaneously; in a similar manner the\r\nlungs seem to be rendered instantly inanimate by the fumes of burning\r\nsulphur.\r\n\r\nThe lungs may be sometimes primarily affected with contagious matter\r\nfloating in the atmosphere as well as the stomach, as mentioned in article\r\n9. of this Supplement. But probably this may occur much less frequently,\r\nbecause the oxygene of the atmosphere does not appear to be taken into the\r\nblood by animal absorption, as the saliva in the stomach, but passes\r\nthrough the moist membranes into the blood, like the ethereal fluids of\r\nelectricity or heat, or by chemical attraction, and in consequence the\r\ncontagious matter may be left behind; except it may sometimes be absorbed\r\nalong with the mucus; of which however in this case there appeared no\r\nsymptoms.\r\n\r\nThe tonsils are other organs liable to receive contagious matter, as in the\r\nsmall-pox, scarlet-fever, and in other sensitive inirritated fevers; but no\r\nsymptom of this appeared here, as the tonsils were at no time of the fever\r\ninflamed, though they were in this child previously uncommonly large.\r\n\r\nThe pain of the forehead does not seem to have been of the internal parts\r\nof the head, because the nerves, which serve the stomach, are not derived\r\nfrom the anterior part of the brain; but it seems to have been owing to a\r\ntorpor of the external membranes about the forehead from their direct\r\nsympathy with those of the stomach; that is, from the deficient excitement\r\nof the sensorial power of association; and seemed in some measure to be\r\nrelieved by the emetics and blisters.\r\n\r\nThe pulsations of the heart were weaker and in consequence quicker than\r\nnatural, owing to their direct sympathy with the torpid peristaltic motions\r\nof the stomach; that is to the deficient excitement of the sensorial power\r\nof association.\r\n\r\nThe action of the cutaneous capillaries and absorbents were stronger than\r\nnatural, as appeared by the perpetual heat and dryness of the skin; which\r\nwas owing to their reverse sympathy with the heart and arteries. This\r\nweaker and quicker action of the heart and arteries, and the stronger\r\naction of the cutaneous capillaries and absorbents, continued throughout\r\nthe disease, and may be said to have constituted the fever, of which the\r\ntorpor of the stomach was the remote cause.\r\n\r\nHis tongue was not very much furred or very dry, nor his breath very hot;\r\nwhich shewed, that there was no great increase of the action of the mucous\r\nabsorbents, nor of the pulmonary capillaries, and yet sufficient to produce\r\ngreat emaciation. His urine was nearly natural both in quantity and colour;\r\nwhich shewed, that there was no increase of action either of the kidnies,\r\nor of the urinary absorbents.\r\n\r\nThe bathing his legs and hands and face for half an hour twice a day seemed\r\nto refresh him, and sometimes made his pulse slower, and thence I suppose\r\nstronger. This seems to have been caused by the water, though subtepid,\r\nbeing much below the heat of his skin, and consequently contributing to\r\ncool the capillaries, and by satiating the absorbents to relieve the uneasy\r\nsensation from the dryness of the skin.\r\n\r\nHe continued the use of three drops of tincture of opium from about the\r\neighth day to the twenty-fourth, and for the three preceding days took\r\nalong with if two large spoonfuls of an infusion of bark in equal parts of\r\nwine and water. The former of these by its stimulus seemed to decrease his\r\nlanguor for a time, and the latter to strengthen his returning power of\r\ndigestion.\r\n\r\nThe daily exacerbations or remissions were obscure, and not well attended\r\nto; but he appeared to be worse on the fourteenth or fifteenth days, as his\r\npulse was then quickest, and his inattention greatest; and he began to get\r\nbetter on the twentieth or twenty-first days of his disease; for the pulse\r\nthen became less frequent, and his skin cooler, and he took rather more\r\nfood: these circumstances seemed to observe the quarter periods of\r\nlunation.\r\n\r\nXIV. _Termination of continued fever._\r\n\r\n1. When the stomach is primarily affected with torpor not by defect of\r\nstimulus, but in consequence of the previous exhaustion of its sensorial\r\npower; and not secondarily by its association with other torpid parts; it\r\nseems to be the general cause of the weak pulsations of the heart and\r\narteries, and the consequent increased action of the capillaries, which\r\nconstitute continued fever with weak pulse. In this situation if the\r\npatient recovers, it is owing to the renovation of life in the torpid\r\nstomach, as happens to the whole system in winter-sleeping animals. If he\r\nperishes, it is owing to the exhaustion of the body for want of nourishment\r\noccasioned by indigestion; which is hastened by the increased actions of\r\nthe capillaries and absorbents.\r\n\r\n2. When the stomach is primarily affected by defect of stimulus, as by cold\r\nor hunger; or secondarily by defect of the power of association, as in\r\nintermittent fevers; or lastly in consequence of the introduction of the\r\nsensorial power of sensation, as in inflammatory diseases; the actions of\r\nthe heart and arteries are not diminished, as when the stomach is primarily\r\naffected with torpor by its previous exhaustion of sensorial power, but\r\nbecome greatly increased, producing irritative or inflammatory fever. Where\r\nthis fever is continued, though with some remissions and exacerbations, the\r\nexcessive action is at length so much lessened by expenditure of sensorial\r\npower, as to gradually terminate in health; or it becomes totally\r\nexhausted, and death succeeds the destruction of the irritability and\r\nassociability of the system.\r\n\r\n3. There is also another termination of the diseases in consequence of\r\ngreat torpor of the stomach, which are not always termed fevers; one of\r\nthese is attended with so great and universal torpor, that the patient dies\r\nin the first cold fit; that is, within twelve hours or less of the first\r\nseizure; this is commonly termed sudden death. But the quickness of the\r\npulse, and the coldness with shuddering, and with sick stomach,\r\ndistinguished a case, which I lately saw, from the sudden deaths occasioned\r\nby apoplexy, or ruptured blood-vessels.\r\n\r\nIn hemicrania I believe the stomach is always affected secondarily, as no\r\nquickness of pulse generally attends it, and as the stomach recovers its\r\nactivity in about two whole days. But in the following case, which I saw\r\nlast week, I suppose the stomach suddenly became paralytic, and caused in\r\nabout a week the death of the patient. Miss ----, a fine young lady about\r\nnineteen, had bathed a few times, about a month before, in a cold spring,\r\nand was always much indisposed after it; she was seized with sickness, and\r\ncold shuddering, with very quick pulse, which was succeeded by a violent\r\nhot fit; during the next cold paroxysm she had a convulsion fit; and after\r\nthat symptoms of insanity, so as to strike and bite the attendants, and to\r\nspeak furious language; the same circumstances occurred during a third fit,\r\nin which I believe a strait waistcoat was put on, and some blood taken from\r\nher; during all this time her stomach would receive no nutriment, except\r\nonce or twice a little wine and water. On the seventh day of the disease,\r\nwhen I saw her, the extremities were cold, the pulse not to be counted and\r\nshe was unable to swallow, or to speak; a clyster was used with turpentine\r\nand musk and opium, with warm fomentations, but she did not recover from\r\nthat cold fit.\r\n\r\nIn this case the convulsion fit and the insanity seem to have been violent\r\nefforts to relieve the disagreeable sensation of the paralytic stomach; and\r\nthe quick pulse, and returning fits of torpor and of orgasm, evinced the\r\ndisease to be attended with fever, though it might have been called\r\nanorexia maniacalis, or epileptica.\r\n\r\n4. Might not many be saved in these fevers with weak pulse for a few weeks\r\nby the introduction of blood into a vein, once in two or three days; which\r\nmight thus give further time for the recovery of the torpid stomach? Which\r\nseems to require some weeks to acquire its former habits of action, like\r\nthe muscles of paralytic patients, who have all their habits of voluntary\r\nassociations to form afresh, as in infancy.\r\n\r\nIf this experiment be again tried on the human subject, it should be so\r\ncontrived, that the blood in passing from the well person to the sick one\r\nshould not be exposed to the air; it should not be cooled or heated; and it\r\nshould be measured; all which may be done in the following manner. Procure\r\ntwo silver pipes, each about an inch long, in the form of funnels, wide at\r\ntop, with a tail beneath, the former something wider than a swan-quill, and\r\nthe latter less than a small crow-quill. Fix one of these silver funnels by\r\nits wide end to one end of the gut of a chicken fresh killed about four or\r\nsix inches long, and the other to the other end of the gut; then introduce\r\nthe small end of one funnel into the vein of the arm of a well person\r\ndownwards towards the hand; and laying the gut with the other end on a\r\nwater-plate heated to 98 degrees in a very warm room; let the blood run\r\nthrough it. Then pressing the finger on the gut near the arm of the well\r\nperson, slide it along so as to press out one gutful into a cup, in order\r\nto ascertain the quantity by weight. Then introduce the other end of the\r\nother funnel into a similar vein in the arm of the sick person upwards\r\ntowards the shoulder; and by sliding one finger, and then another\r\nreciprocally, along the chicken's gut, so as to compress it, from the arm\r\nof the well person to the arm of the sick one, the blood may be measured,\r\nand thus the exact quantity known which is given and received. See Class I.\r\n2. 3. 25.\r\n\r\nXV. _Inflammation excited in fever._\r\n\r\n1. When the actions of any part of the system of capillaries are excited to\r\na certain degree, sensation is produced, along with a greater quantity of\r\nheat, as mentioned in the fifth article of this supplement. When this\r\nincreased capillary action becomes still more energetic, by the combined\r\nsensorial powers of sensation with irritation, new fibres are secreted, or\r\nnew fluids, (which harden into fibres like the mucus secreted by the\r\nsilk-worm, or spider, or pinna,) from which new vessels are constructed; it\r\nis then termed inflammation: if this exists in the capillary vessels of the\r\ncellular membrane or skin only, with feeble pulsations of the heart and\r\narteries, the febris sensitiva inirritata, or malignant fever, occurs; if\r\nthe coats of the arteries are also inflamed, the febris sensitiva irritata,\r\nor inflammatory fever, exists.\r\n\r\nIn all these fevers the part inflamed is called a phlegmon, and by its\r\nviolent actions excites so much pain, that is, so much of the sensorial\r\npower of sensation, as to produce more violent actions, and inflammation,\r\nthroughout the whole system. Whence great heat from the excited capillaries\r\nof the skin, large and quick pulsations of the heart, full and hard\r\narteries, with great universal secretions and absorptions. These\r\nperpetually continue, though with exacerbations and remissions; which seem\r\nto be governed by solar or lunar influence.\r\n\r\n2. In this situation there generally, I suppose, exists an increased\r\nactivity of the secerning vessels of the brain, and consequently an\r\nincreased production of sensorial power; in less violent quantity of this\r\ndisease however the increase of the action of the heart and arteries may be\r\nowing simply to the accumulation of sensorial power of association in the\r\nstomach, when that organ is affected by sympathy with some inflamed part.\r\nIn the same manner as the capillaries are violently and permanently\r\nactuated by the accumulation of the sensorial power of association in the\r\nheart and arteries, when the stomach is affected primarily by contagious\r\nmatter, and the heart and arteries secondarily. Thus I suspect, that in the\r\ndistinct small-pox the stomach is affected secondarily by sympathy with the\r\ninfected tonsils or inoculated arm; but that in the confluent small-pox the\r\nstomach is affected primarily, as well as the tonsils, by contagious matter\r\nmixed with the saliva, and swallowed.\r\n\r\n3. In inflammatory fevers with great arterial action, as the stomach is not\r\nalways affected with torpor, and as there is a direct sympathy between the\r\nstomach and heart, some people have believed, that nauseating doses of some\r\nemetic drug, as of antimonium tartarizatum, have been administered with\r\nadvantage, abating by direct sympathy the actions of the heart. This theory\r\nis not ill founded, and the use of digitalis, given in small doses, as from\r\nhalf a dram to a dram of the saturated tincture, two or three times a day,\r\nas well as other less violent emetic drugs, would be worth the attention of\r\nhospital physicians.\r\n\r\nSickness might also be produced probably with advantage by whirling the\r\npatient in a chair suspended from the cieling by two parallel cords; which\r\nafter being revolved fifty or one hundred times in one direction, would\r\nreturn with great circular velocity, and produce vertigo, similar I suppose\r\nto sea-sickness. And lastly the sickness produced by respiring an\r\natmosphere mixed with one tenth of carbonated hydrogen, discovered by Mr.\r\nWatt, and published by Dr. Beddoes, would be well worthy exact and repeated\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\n4. Cool air, cool fomentations, or ablutions, are also useful in this\r\ninflammatory fever; as by cooling the particles of blood in the cutaneous\r\nand pulmonary vessels, they must return to the heart with less stimulus,\r\nthan when they are heated above the natural degree of ninety-eight. For\r\nthis purpose snow and ice have been scattered on the patients in Italy; and\r\ncold bathing has been used at the eruption of the small pox in China, and\r\nboth, it is said, with advantage. See Class III. 2. 1. 12. and Suppl. I. 8.\r\n\r\n5. The lancet however with repeated mild cathartics is the great agent in\r\ndestroying this enormous excitement of the system, so long as the strength\r\nof the patient will admit of evacuations. Blisters over the painful part,\r\nwhere the phlegmon or topical inflammation is situated, after great\r\nevacuation, is of evident service, as in pleurisy. Warm bathing for half an\r\nhour twice a day, when the patient becomes enfeebled, is of great benefit,\r\nas in peripneumony and rheumatism.\r\n\r\n6. When other means fail of success in abating the violent excitement of\r\nthe system in inflammatory diseases, might not the shaved head be covered\r\nwith large bladders of cold water, in which ice or salt had been recently\r\ndissolved; and changed as often as necessary, till the brain is rendered in\r\nsome degree torpid by cold?--Might not a greater degree of cold, as iced\r\nwater, or snow, be applied to the cutaneous capillaries?\r\n\r\n7. Another experiment I have frequently wished to try, which cannot be done\r\nin private practice, and which I therefore recommend to some hospital\r\nphysician; and that is, to endeavour to still the violent actions of the\r\nheart and arteries, after due evacuations by venesection and cathartics, by\r\ngently compressing the brain. This might be done by suspending a bed, so as\r\nto whirl the patient round with his head most distant from the center of\r\nmotion, as if he lay across a millstone, as described in Sect. XVIII. 20.\r\nFor this purpose a perpendicular shaft armed with iron gudgeons might have\r\none end pass into the floor, and the other into a beam in the cieling, with\r\nan horizontal arm, to which a small bed might be readily suspended.\r\n\r\nBy thus whirling the patient with increasing velocity sleep might be\r\nproduced, and probably the violence of the actions of the heart and\r\narteries might be diminished in inflammatory fevers; and, as it is\r\nbelieved, that no accumulation of sensorial power would succeed a torpor of\r\nthe origin of the nerves, either thus procured by mechanical compression,\r\nor by the bladder-cap of cold water above described, the lives of thousands\r\nmight probably be saved by thus extinguishing the exacerbations of febrile\r\nparoxysms, or preventing the returns of them.\r\n\r\nIn fevers with weak pulse sleep, or a degree of stupor, thus produced,\r\nmight prevent the too great expenditure of sensorial power, and thus\r\ncontribute to preserve the patient. See Class I. 2. 5. 10. on stupor. What\r\nmight be the consequence of whirling a person with his head next the center\r\nof motion, so as to force the blood from the brain into the other parts of\r\nthe body, might be discovered by cautious experiment without danger, and\r\nmight probably add to our ability of curing fever.\r\n\r\nXVI. _Recapitulation._\r\n\r\n1. The sensorial power causes the contraction of the fibres, and is excited\r\ninto action by four different circumstances, by the stimulus of external\r\nbodies, by pain or pleasure, by desire or aversion, or by the previous\r\nmotions of other contracting fibres. In the first situation it is called\r\nthe sensorial power of irritation, in the second the sensorial power of\r\nsensation, in the third the sensorial power of volition, and in the fourth\r\nthe sensorial power of association.\r\n\r\nMany parts of the body are excited into perpetual action, as the\r\nsanguiferous vessels consisting of the heart, arteries, and veins; others\r\ninto nearly perpetual action, as the conglomerate and capillary glands; and\r\nothers into actions still somewhat less frequent, as the alimentary canal,\r\nand the lacteal and lymphatic absorbents with their conglobate glands: all\r\nthese are principally actuated by the sensorial powers of irritation, and\r\nof association; but in some degree or at some times by those of sensation,\r\nand even of volition. There are three kinds of stimulus, which may easily\r\nbe occasionally diminished, that of heat on the skin, of food in the\r\nstomach, and of the oxygenous part of the atmosphere, which mixes with the\r\nblood in respiration, and stimulates the heart and arteries.\r\n\r\n2. When any parts, which are naturally excited into perpetual action by\r\nstimulus, become torpid or less active from decrease of that stimulus;\r\nthere first occurs a decrease of the activity of the parts next catenated\r\nwith them; thus going into cold water produces a torpor of the capillary\r\nvessels of the lungs, as is known by the difficult respiration, which\r\nimmediately occurs; for the sensorial power of association, which naturally\r\ncontributes to actuate the lungs, is now less excited by the decreased\r\nactions of the cutaneous vessels, with which they are catenated. This\r\nconstitutes the cold fit of fever.\r\n\r\nThere next occurs an accumulation of the sensorial power of irritation in\r\nthe parts, which were torpid from defect of stimulus, as the cutaneous\r\nvessels for instance when exposed to cold air; and a similar accumulation\r\nof the sensorial power of association occurs in the parts which were\r\ncatenated with the former, as the vessels of the lungs in the example above\r\nmentioned. Whence, if the subduction of stimulus has not been too great, so\r\nas to impair the health of the part, the activity of the irritative motions\r\nreturns, even though the stimulus continues less than usual; and those of\r\nthe associate motions become considerably increased, because these latter\r\nare now excited by the previous fibrous motions, which now act as strong or\r\nstronger than formerly, and have also acquired an accumulation of the\r\nsensorial power of association. This accounts for the curious event of our\r\nbecoming warm in a minute or two after remaining in water of about 80\r\ndegrees of heat, as in the bath at Buxton; or in the cold air of a frosty\r\nmorning of about 30 degrees of heat.\r\n\r\nBut if the parts thus possessed of the accumulated sensorial powers of\r\nirritation and of association be exposed again to their natural quantity of\r\nstimulus, a great excess of activity supervenes; because the fibres, which\r\npossess accumulated irritation, are now excited by their usual quantity of\r\nstimulus; and those which possess accumulated association, are now excited\r\nby double or treble the quantity of the preceding irritative fibrous\r\nmotions, with which they are catenated; this constitutes the hot fit of\r\nfever.\r\n\r\nAnother important circumstance occurs, when the parts, which are torpid\r\nfrom decreased stimulus, do not accumulate a quantity of sensorial power\r\nsufficient for the purpose of renewing their own natural quantity of\r\naction; but are nevertheless not so torpid, as to have the life of the part\r\nimpaired. In this situation the superabundance of the accumulated power of\r\nirritation contributes to actuate the associate motions next catenated with\r\nthem. Thus, when a person breathes air with less oxygene than natural, as\r\nby covering his head in bed, and thus respiring the same atmosphere\r\nrepeatedly, the heart and arteries become less active by defect of the\r\nstimulus of oxygene; and then the accumulation of sensorial power of\r\nirritation becomes instantly very great, as these organs are subject to\r\nperpetual and energetic action. This accumulation nevertheless is not so\r\ngreat as to renew their own activity under this defect of stimulus, but yet\r\nis in sufficient abundance to increase the associability of the next link\r\nof catenation, that is, to actuate the capillaries of the skin with great\r\nand perpetual increase of energy. This resembles continued fever with weak\r\npulse; in which the accumulation of the sensorial power caused by the\r\nlessened motions of the heart and arteries, actuates the capillaries with\r\nincrease of energy.\r\n\r\n3. When the accumulation of the sensorial power of association, which is\r\ncaused as above explained by deficient excitement owing to the lessened\r\nquantity of action of the irritative fibrous motions, with which the\r\nassociate train is catenated, is not in quantity sufficient to renew the\r\nnatural actions of the first link of an associate train of motions; it is\r\nnevertheless frequently so abundant as to actuate the next link of the\r\nassociated train with unnatural energy by increasing its associability; and\r\nthat in a still greater degree if that second link of the associated train\r\nwas previously in a torpid state, that is, had previously acquired some\r\naccumulation of the sensorial power of association. This important\r\ncircumstance of the animal economy is worthy our most accurate attention.\r\nThus if the heart and arteries are deprived of their due quantity of the\r\nstimulus of oxygene in the blood, a weak and quick pulse ensues, with an\r\naccumulation of the sensorial power of irritation; next follows an increase\r\nof the action of the capillaries by the superabundance of this accumulated\r\npower of irritation; but there also exists an accumulation of the power of\r\nassociation in these acting capillaries, which is not now excited by the\r\ndeficient actions of the heart and arteries; but which by its abundance\r\ncontributes to actuate the next link of association, which is the sick\r\nstomach in the case related from Sydenham in Class IV. 1. 1. 2. and\r\nexplained in this Supplement I. 4. And as this sick stomach was in a\r\nprevious state of torpor, it might at the same time possess an accumulation\r\nof some sensorial power, which, if it was of association, would be thus\r\nmore powerfully excited by the increased actions of the capillaries; which\r\nexisted in consequence of the weak action of the heart and arteries. This\r\nalso resembles in some respects the continued fevers with weak pulse, and\r\nwith increased activity of the capillaries.\r\n\r\n4. When a torpor of some irritative motions occurs from a previous\r\nexhaustion of the sensorial power of irritation by the action of some very\r\ngreat stimulus, it is long before any accumulation of the sensorial power\r\nof irritation is produced; as is experienced in the sickness and languor,\r\nwhich continues a whole day after a fit of drunkenness. But nevertheless\r\nthere occurs an accumulation of the sensorial power of association in the\r\nfirst link of the associate train of motions, which is catenated with these\r\ntorpid irritative ones; which accumulation is owing to deficient excitement\r\nof that sensorial power in the first link of the associate train. This\r\nfirst link therefore exists also in a less active or torpid state, but the\r\naccumulation of the sensorial power of association by its superabundance\r\ncontributes to actuate the second link of the associate train with\r\nunnatural quantity of motion; and that though its own natural quantity of\r\nthe power of association is not excited by the deficient action of\r\npreceding fibrous motions.\r\n\r\nWhen this happens to the stomach, as after its irritative motions have been\r\nmuch exerted from the unnatural stimulus of wine, or opium, or of\r\ncontagious matter mixed with the saliva, a torpor or inactivity of it\r\nsucceeds for a greater or less length of time; as no accumulation of the\r\nsensorial power of irritation can occur, till the natural quantity, which\r\nhas been previously expended, is first restored. Then the heart and\r\narteries which are next in catenation, become less active from the want of\r\nsufficient excitement of the sensorial power of association, which\r\npreviously contributed to actuate them. This sensorial power of association\r\ntherefore becomes accumulated, and by its superabundance contributes to\r\nactuate the link next in association, which has thus acquired so great a\r\ndegree of associability, as to overbalance the less quantity of the\r\nexcitement of it by the torpid action of the previous or first associate\r\nlink. This happens to the capillaries, when the heart and arteries are\r\naffected as above by the torpor of the stomach, when it is occasioned by\r\nprevious great expenditure of its sensorial power, and thus constitutes\r\nfever with weak pulse, which is here termed inirritative fever, typhus\r\nmitior.\r\n\r\n5. When a deficiency of stimulus is too great or too long continued, so as\r\nto impair the life of the part, no further accumulation of sensorial power\r\noccurs; as when the skin is long exposed to cold and damp air. In that case\r\nthe link in catenation, that is, the first of the associate train, is\r\nrendered torpid by defect of excitement of its usual quantity of the\r\nsensorial power of association, and from there being no accumulation of the\r\nsensorial power of irritation to increase its associability, and thus to\r\ncontribute to actuate it by overbalancing the defect of the excitement of\r\nits association.\r\n\r\nThus on riding long and slowly on a cold and damp day, the exhalation of\r\nthe vapour, which is impinged on the skin, as the traveller proceeds,\r\ncarries away his warmth faster, than it is generated within the system; and\r\nthus the capillaries of the skin have their actions so much impaired after\r\na time, that no accumulation of the sensorial power of irritation occurs;\r\nand then the stomach, whose motions are catenated with those of the\r\ncapillaries, ceases to act from the deficient excitement of the power of\r\nassociation; and indigestion and flatulency succeed, instead of the\r\nincreased digestion and hunger, which occur, when the cutaneous capillaries\r\nare exposed to a less degree of cold, and for a shorter time. In which\r\nlatter situation the accumulation of the sensorial power of irritation\r\nincreases by its superabundance the associability of the fibres of the\r\nstomach, so as to overbalance the defect of the excitement of their\r\nassociation.\r\n\r\n6. The stomach is affected secondarily in fevers with strong pulse, as in\r\nthose with weak pulse it is affected primarily. To illustrate this doctrine\r\nI shall relate the following case of Mr. Y----. He was a young man rather\r\nintemperate in the use of wine or beer, and was seized with a cold fit, and\r\nwith a consequent hot one with strong pulse; on examining his hypochondrium\r\nan oblong tumour was distinctly felt on the left side of the stomach, which\r\nextended six or eight inches downward, and was believed to be a tumour of\r\nthe spleen, which thus occasioned by its torpor the cold fit and consequent\r\nhot fit of fever with strong pulse. This fever continued, though with\r\nremissions, for two or three weeks; and the patient repeatedly lost blood,\r\nused cathartics with calomel and sena, and had frequent antimonial and\r\nsaline medicines. And after he was much weakened by evacuations, the\r\nperuvian bark and small doses of steel removed the fever, but the tumour\r\nremained many years during the remainder of his life.\r\n\r\nIn this case the tumour of the spleen was occasioned by the torpor of the\r\nabsorbent vessels; while the secerning vessels continued somewhat longer to\r\npour their fluids into the cells of it. Then the inactivity of this viscus\r\naffected the whole system with torpor by the deficient excitement of the\r\nsensorial power of association, which contributes along with the irritation\r\ncaused by their specific stimuli to actuate the whole sanguiferous,\r\nsecerning, and absorbent vessels; and along with these the stomach, which\r\npossesses perhaps greater mobility, or promptitude to torpor or to orgasm,\r\nthan any other part. And after a time all these parts recover their actions\r\nby the accumulation of their sensorial power of association. But the spleen\r\nnot recovering its action from the accumulation of its power of irritation,\r\nas appeared from the continuance of the tumor, still affects the stomach by\r\nits defective irritative motions ceasing to excite the association, which\r\nought to contribute to actuate it.\r\n\r\nHence the stomach continues torpid in respect to its motions, but\r\naccumulates its power of association; which is not excited into action by\r\nthe defective motions of the spleen; this accumulation of the sensorial\r\npower of association now by its superabundance actuates the next link of\r\nassociate motions, which consists of the heart and arteries, into greater\r\nenergy of action than natural, and thus causes fever with strong pulse;\r\nwhich, as it was supposed to be most frequently excited by increase of\r\nirritation, is called irritative fever or synocha.\r\n\r\nSimilar to this in the small pox, which is given by inoculation, the\r\nstomach is affected secondarily, when the fever commences; and hence in\r\nthis small-pox the pulsations of the heart and arteries are frequently\r\nstronger than natural, but never weaker, for the reasons above given.\r\nWhereas in that small-pox, which is caused by the stomach being primarily\r\naffected, by the contagious matter being swallowed with the saliva, whether\r\nthe tonsils are at the same time affected or not, the pulsations of the\r\nheart and arteries become weak, and the inirritative fever is produced, as\r\nexplained above, along with the confluent small-pox. This unfolds the cause\r\nof the mildness of the inoculated small-pox; because in this disease the\r\nstomach is affected secondarily, whereas in the natural small-pox it is\r\nfrequently affected primarily by swallowing the contagious matter mixed\r\nwith saliva.\r\n\r\nIn the measles I suppose the contagious matter to be dissolved in the air,\r\nand therefore not liable to be mixed with the saliva; whereas the variolous\r\nmatter is probably only diffused in the air, and thence more readily mixed\r\nwith the saliva in the mouth during respiration. This difference appears\r\nmore probable, as the small-pox I believe is always taken at a less\r\ndistance from the diseased person than is necessary to acquire the measles.\r\nThe contagion of the measles affects the membranes of the nostrils, and the\r\nsecretion of tears in consequence, but never I suspect the stomach\r\nprimarily, but always secondarily; whence the pulsation of the heart and\r\narteries is always stronger than natural, so as to bear the lancet at any\r\nperiod of the disease.\r\n\r\nThe great mildness sometimes, and fatality at other times, of the scarlet\r\nfever may depend on the same circumstance; that is, on the stomach being\r\nprimarily or secondarily affected by the contagious matter, observing that\r\nthe tonsils may be affected at the same time with the stomach. Should this\r\nprove to be the case, which future observations must determine, what\r\ncertain advantage must arise from the inoculation of this disease! When it\r\nis received by the skin primarily I suppose no sore throat attends it, nor\r\nfever with weak pulse; when it is received by the stomach primarily, the\r\ntonsils are affected at the same time, and the torpor of the stomach\r\nproduces inirritative fever, and the mortification of the tonsils succeeds.\r\n\r\nWe may hence conclude, that when the torpor of the stomach is either owing\r\nto defect of stimulus, which is not so great as to impair the life of the\r\npart, as in moderate hunger, or in swallowing iced water, or when its\r\ntorpor is induced by its catenation or association with other torpid parts,\r\nas in the commencement of intermittent fevers, and inoculated small-pox,\r\nthat the subsequent action of the heart and arteries is generally\r\nincreased, producing irritative fever. Which is owing to the accumulation,\r\nof the sensorial power of irritation in one case, and of association in the\r\nother, contributing to actuate the next link of the catenated or associated\r\nmotions. But when the torpor of the stomach is induced by previous\r\nexhaustion of its sensorial powers of irritation or of association by\r\ncontinued violent action, as by the stimulus of digitalis, or of contagious\r\nmatter, or after intoxication from wine or opium, a weaker action of the\r\nheart and arteries succeeds, because there is no accumulation of sensorial\r\npower, and a deficient excitement of association. And finally, as this weak\r\naction of the heart and arteries is not induced by exhaustion of sensorial\r\npower, but by defect of the excitement of association, the accumulation of\r\nthis power of association increases the action of the capillaries, and thus\r\ninduces inirritative fever.\r\n\r\n7. When any part of the system acts very violently in fevers, the sensorial\r\npower of sensation is excited, which increases the actions of the moving\r\nsystem; whereas the pain, which arises from decreased irritative motions,\r\nas in hemicrania, seems to exhaust a quantity of sensorial power, without\r\nproducing or increasing any fibrous actions.\r\n\r\nWhen the stomach is primarily affected, as in inirritative fevers from\r\ncontagion, and in such a manner as to occasion pain, the action of the\r\ncapillaries seems to be increased by this additional sensorial power of\r\nsensation, whence extensive inflammation or mortification; but when the\r\nstomach and consequently the heart and arteries continue their torpidity of\r\naction; as in confluent small-pox, and fatal scarlatina; this constitutes\r\nsensitive inirritative fever, or typhus gravior.\r\n\r\nBut when the stomach is secondarily affected, if the sensorial power of\r\nsensation is excited, as in pleurisy or peripneumony, the actions of the\r\nheart and arteries are violently increased, and of all the moving system\r\nalong with them. Thus the peripneumony is generally induced by the patient\r\nrespiring very cold air, and this especially after being long confined to\r\nwarm air, or after being much fatigued and heated by excessive labour or\r\nexercise. For we can cover the skin with more clothes, when we feel\r\nourselves cold; but the lungs not having the perception of cold, we do not\r\nthink of covering them, nor have the power to cover them, if we desired it;\r\nand the torpor, thus produced is greater, or of longer duration, in\r\nproportion to the previous expenditure of sensorial power by heat or\r\nexercise.\r\n\r\nThis torpor of the lungs affects the skin with shuddering, and the stomach\r\nis also secondarily affected; next follows the violent action of the lungs\r\nfrom the accumulation of the power of irritation, and an inflammation of\r\nthem follows this violent action. While the stomach recovers its activity\r\nby the increase of the excitement of the sensorial power of association,\r\nand along with it the heart and arteries, and the whole moving system.\r\nHence this inflammation occurs during the hot fit of fever, and no cold fit\r\nsucceeds, because the excess of the sensorial power of sensation prevents a\r\nsucceeding torpor.\r\n\r\nThese new motions of certain parts of the system produce increased\r\nsecretions of nutritious or organic mucus, which forms new vessels; these\r\nnew vessels by their unusual motions produce new kinds of fluids; which are\r\ntermed contagious, because they have the power, when introduced into a\r\nhealthy body, of producing similar actions and effects, with or without\r\nfever, as in the small-pox and measles, or in the itch and venereal\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nIf any of these contagious matters affect the stomach with torpor either by\r\ntheir stimulus immediately applied, or by its sympathy with the parts first\r\ndiseased, a fever is produced with sickness and want of appetite; as in\r\nsmall-pox, and scarlatina. If the stomach is not affected by contagious\r\nmatter, no fever succeeds, as in itch, tinea, syphilis.\r\n\r\nAll these contagious matters are conceived to be harmless, till they have\r\nbeen exposed to the air, either openly or through a moist membrane; from\r\nwhich they are believed to acquire oxygene, and thence to become some kinds\r\nof animal acids. As the preparations of mercury cure venereal ulcers; as a\r\nquarter of a grain of sublimate dissolved in wine, and given thrice a day;\r\nthis effect, seems to be produced either by its stimulating the absorbents\r\nin the ulcer to absorb the venereal matter before it has acquired oxygene;\r\nor by afterwards uniting with it chemically, and again depriving it of its\r\nacquired acidity. On either supposition it might probably be given with\r\nadvantage in small-pox, and in all infectious diseases, both previous to\r\ntheir commencement, and during their whole progress.\r\n\r\n8. The cold fits of intermittent fevers are caused by the torpor of some\r\npart owing to deficient irritation, and of the other parts of the system\r\nfrom deficient association. The hot fits are owing first to the\r\naccumulation of irritation in the part primarily affected, if it recovers\r\nits action, which does not always happen; and secondly to the accumulation\r\nof association in the other parts of the system, which during health are\r\nsubject to perpetual action; and lastly also to the greater excitement of\r\nthe power of association, when the part primarily affected recovers its\r\nirritability, and acts with greater energy than natural.\r\n\r\nThe deficient secretions in the cold fit depend on the torpor of the\r\nglandular system; and the increased secretions in the hot fit on their more\r\nenergetic action. The thirst in the cold fit is owing to the deficient\r\nabsorption from the skin, cellular membrane, and bladder; the thirst in the\r\nhot fit is owing to the too great dissipation of the aqueous part of the\r\nblood. The urine is pale and in small quantity in the cold fit from\r\ndeficient secretion of it, and from deficient absorption of its aqueous\r\nparts; it is high coloured, and sometimes deposits a sediment, in the hot\r\nfit from the greater secretion of it in the kidneys, and the greater\r\nabsorption of its aqueous and saline part in the bladder. The dryness and\r\nscurf on the tongue and nostrils is owing to the increased heat of the air\r\nexpired from the lungs, and consequent greater evaporation of the aqueous\r\npart of the mucus. The sweats appear in consequence of the declension of\r\nthe hot fit, owing to the absorbent vessels of the skin losing their\r\nincreased action sooner than the secerning ones; and to the evaporation\r\nlessening as the skin becomes cooler. The returns of the paroxysms are\r\nprincipally owing to the torpor of some less essential part of the system\r\nremaining after the termination of the last fit; and are also dependent on\r\nsolar or lunar diurnal periods.\r\n\r\nThe torpor of the part, which induces the cold paroxysm, is owing to\r\ndeficient irritation occasioned either by the subduction of the natural\r\nstimuli of food, or water, or pure air, or by deficiency of external\r\ninfluences, as of heat, or of solar or lunar gravitation. Or secondly, in\r\nconsequence of the exhaustion of sensorial power by great previous\r\nexertions of some parts of the system, as of the limbs by great labour or\r\nexercise, or of the stomach by great stimulus, as by contagious matter\r\nswallowed with the saliva, or by much wine or opium previously taken into\r\nit. Or lastly a torpor of a part may be occasioned by some mechanic injury,\r\nas by a compression of the nerves of the part, or of their origin in the\r\nbrain; as the sitting long with one leg crossed over the other occasions\r\nnumbness, and as a torpor of the stomach, with vomiting frequently precedes\r\nparalytic strokes of the limbs.\r\n\r\nAs sleep is produced, either by defect of stimulus, or by previous\r\nexhaustion of sensorial power; so the accumulation of the sensorial power\r\nof volition in those muscles and organs of sense, which are generally\r\nobedient to it, awakens the sleeping person; when it has increased the\r\nquantity of voluntarity so much as to overbalance the defect of stimulus in\r\none case, and the exhaustion of sensorial power in the other; which latter\r\nrequires a much longer time of sleep than the former. So the cold paroxysm\r\nof fever is produced either by defect of stimulus, or by previous\r\nexhaustion of the sensorial power of some part of the system; and the\r\naccumulation of the sensorial power of irritation in that part renews the\r\naction of it, when it has increased its irritability so much as to\r\noverbalance the defect of stimulus in one case and the exhaustion of\r\nsensorial power in the other; which latter requires a much longer torpor or\r\ncold fit than the former.\r\n\r\nBut in the cold paroxysm of fever besides the torpor of one part of the\r\nsystem from defect of irritation, the remainder of it becomes torpid owing\r\nto defect of excitement of the sensorial power of association by the\r\nlessened action of the part first affected. This torpor of the general\r\nsystem remains, till the accumulation of the sensorial power of association\r\nhas increased the associability so much as to overbalance the defect of the\r\nexcitement of association; then the torpor ceases, and if the first\r\naffected part has recovered its activity the other parts are all thrown\r\ninto excess of action by their increased associability, and the hot fit of\r\nfever is produced.\r\n\r\n9. In the continued fevers with strong pulse the stomach is affected\r\nsecondarily, and thus acts feebly from deficient excitement of the power of\r\nassociation; but the accumulation of the power of association thus produced\r\nin an organ subject to perpetual and energetic action, is so great as to\r\naffect the next link of the associate train, which consists of the heart\r\nand arteries; these therefore are exerted perpetually with increase of\r\naction.\r\n\r\nIn continued fevers with weak pulse the torpid stomach is affected\r\nprimarily by previous exhaustion of its irritability by stimulus, as of\r\ncontagious matter swallowed into it. The heart and arteries act feebly from\r\ndeficient excitement of the power of association, owing to the torpor of\r\nthe stomach, with which they are catenated; but the accumulation of the\r\npower of association, thus produced in organs subject to perpetual and\r\nenergetic motion, is so great, as to affect the next link of the associate\r\ntrain; which consists of the capillaries of the skin or other glands; these\r\ntherefore are exerted perpetually with great increase of action.\r\n\r\nThe continued fevers with strong pulse terminate by the reduction or\r\nexhaustion of the sensorial power by violent action of the whole system;\r\nwhich is followed either by return of health with the natural quantity of\r\nirritability, and of associability, or by a total destruction of them both,\r\nand consequent death.\r\n\r\nIn continued fevers with weak pulse the stomach remains torpid during the\r\nwhole course of the fever; and at length by the recovery of its\r\nirritability and sensibility effects the cure of it. Which generally\r\nhappens about the first, second, or third quarter of the lunar period,\r\ncounted from the commencement of the disease, or continues a whole\r\nlunation, and sometimes more; which gave rise to what are termed critical\r\ndays. See Sect. XXXVI. 4. on this subject. If the stomach does not recover\r\nfrom its torpor, the patient becomes emaciated, and dies exhausted by the\r\ncontinuance of the increased action of the capillaries and absorbents, and\r\nthe want of nourishment.\r\n\r\nThe cure of continued fever with weak pulse consists first in weakening the\r\nundue action of the capillaries of the skin by ablution with cold water\r\nfrom 32 to 80 degrees of heat; or by exposing them to cool air. Secondly by\r\ninvigorating the actions of the stomach, by decreasing them for a time, and\r\nthence accumulating the power of irritation, as by an emetic, or by iced\r\nwater, or iced wine. Or by increase of stimulus, as by bark, wine, opium,\r\nand food, in small quantities frequently repeated. Or by renewing the\r\naction of the stomach by slight electric shocks. Or by fomenting it\r\nfrequently with water heated to 96 or 100 degrees. Or lastly by exciting\r\nits power of association with other parts of the system, as by a blister;\r\nwhich succeeds best when the extremities are cool; or by swinging, as in\r\nvertigo rotatoria.\r\n\r\nIf by the stimulus of the Peruvian bark on the fibres of the stomach, they\r\nregain their due action, the heart and arteries also regain their due\r\naction; as their sensorial power of association is now excited, and\r\nexpended as usual. And as there is then no accumulation of sensorial power\r\nin the heart and arteries, the capillaries cease to act with too great\r\nenergy, and the fever is cured.\r\n\r\nThirdly. If the heart and arteries could be themselves stimulated into\r\ngreater action, although the stomach remained torpid, they might probably\r\nby expending a greater quantity of the sensorial power of irritation,\r\nprevent an accumulation of the sensorial power of association, (for these\r\nmay possibly be only different modes of action of the spirit of animation,)\r\nand thus the too great action of the capillaries might be prevented and the\r\nfever cease. This new mode of cure might possibly be accomplished, if the\r\npatient was to breathe a gallon or two of pure or diluted oxygene gas\r\nfrequently in a day; which by passing through the moist membranes of the\r\nlungs and uniting with the blood might render it more stimulant, and thus\r\nexcite the heart and arteries into greater action.\r\n\r\nFourthly. Greater energy might probably be given to the whole system, and\r\nparticularly to those parts which act too feebly in fevers, as the stomach\r\nand the heart and arteries, if the action of the secerning vessels of the\r\nbrain could be increased in energy; this is probably one effect of all\r\nthose drugs, which when given in large quantity induce intoxication, as\r\nwine and opium. And when given with great caution in small quantities\r\nuniformly repeated, as from three drops to five of the tincture of opium,\r\nbut not more, every six hours, I believe they supply an efficacious\r\nmedicine in fevers with great arterial debility; and the more so, if the\r\nPeruvian bark be exhibited alternately every six hours along with them.\r\nThere are other means of exciting the vessels of the brain into action; as\r\nfirst by decreasing the stimulus of heat by temporary cold fomentation;\r\nsecondly, increasing the stimulus of heat by long continued warm\r\nfomentation; thirdly, by electricity, as very small shocks passed through\r\nit in all directions; and lastly by blisters on the head. All those require\r\nto be used with great caution, and especially where there exists an evident\r\nstupor, as the removing of that is I believe frequently injurious. See\r\nstupor, Class I. 2. 5. 10.\r\n\r\nThe cure of fever with strong pulse consists in the repeated use of\r\nvenesection, gentle cathartics, diluents; medicines producing sickness, as\r\nantimonials, digitalis; or the respiration of carbonated hydrogen; or by\r\nrespiration of atmospheric air lowered by a mixture of hydrogen, azote, or\r\ncarbonic acid gas, or by compressing the brain by whirling in a decumbent\r\nposture, as if lying across an horizontal mill-stone. See the former parts\r\nof this supplement for the methods of cure both of fevers with strong and\r\nweak pulse.\r\n\r\n10. When any difficulty occurs in determining the weak pulse from the\r\nstrong one, it may generally be assisted by counting its frequency. For\r\nwhen an adult patient lies horizontally in a cool room, and is not hurried\r\nor alarmed by the approach of his physician, nor stimulated by wine or\r\nopium, the strong pulse seldom exceeds 118 or 120 in a minute; and the weak\r\npulse is generally not much below 130, and often much above that number.\r\nSecondly in sitting up in bed, or changing the horizontal to a\r\nperpendicular posture, the quickness of the weak pulse is liable\r\nimmediately to increase 10 or 20 pulsations in a minute, which does not I\r\nbelieve occur in the strong pulse, when the patient has rested himself\r\nafter the exertion of rising.\r\n\r\nXVII. _Conclusion._\r\n\r\nThus have I given an outline of what may be termed the sympathetic theory\r\nof fevers, to distinguish it from the mechanic theory of Boerhaave, the\r\nspasmodic theory of Hoffman and of Cullen, and the putrid theory of\r\nPringle. What I have thus delivered, I beg to be considered rather as\r\nobservations and conjectures, than as things explained and demonstrated; to\r\nbe considered as a foundation and a scaffolding, which may enable future\r\nindustry to erect a solid and a beautiful edifice, eminent both for its\r\nsimplicity and utility, as well as for the permanency of its\r\nmaterials,--which may not moulder, like the structures already erected,\r\ninto the sand of which they were composed; but which may stand unimpaired,\r\nlike the Newtonian philosophy, a rock amid the waste of ages!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nADDITIONS.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nADDITION I.\r\n\r\n    At the end of the article Canities, in Class I. 2. 2. 11. please to add\r\n    the following:\r\n\r\nAs mechanical injury from a percussion, or a wound, or a caustic, is liable\r\nto occasion the hair of the part to become grey; so I suspect the\r\ncompression of parts against each other of some animals in the womb is\r\nliable to render the hair of those parts of a lighter colour; as seems\r\noften to occur in black cats and dogs. A small terrier bitch now stands by\r\nme, which is black on all those parts, which were external, when she was\r\nwrapped up in the uterus, teres atque rotunda; and those parts white, which\r\nwere most constantly pressed together; and those parts tawny, which were\r\ngenerally but less constantly pressed together. Thus the hair of the back\r\nfrom the forehead to the end of the tail is black, as well as that of the\r\nsides, and external parts of the legs, both before and behind.\r\n\r\nAs in the uterus the chin of the whelp is bent down, and lies in contact\r\nwith the fore part of the neck and breast; the tail is applied close\r\nagainst the division of the thighs behind; the inside of the hinder thighs\r\nare pressed close to the sides of the belly, all these parts have white\r\nhairs.\r\n\r\nThe fore-legs in the uterus lie on each side of the face; so that the feet\r\ncover part of the temples, and compress the prominent part of the upper\r\neye-brows, but are so placed as to defend the eye-balls from pressure; it\r\nis curious to observe, that the hair of the sides of the face, and of the\r\nprominent upper eye-brows, are tawny, and of the inside of the feet and\r\nlegs, which covered them; for as this posture admitted of more change in\r\nthe latter weeks of gestation, the colour of these parts is not so far\r\nremoved from black, as of those parts, where the contact or compression was\r\nmore uniform.\r\n\r\nWhere this uterine compression of parts has not been so great as to render\r\nthe hair white in other animals, it frequently happens, that the\r\nextremities of the body are white, as the feet, and noses, and tips of the\r\nears of dogs and cats and horses, where the circulation is naturally\r\nweaker; whence it would seem, that the capillary glands, which form the\r\nhair, are impeded in the first instance by compression, and in the last by\r\nthe debility of the circulation in them. See Class I. 1. 2. 15.\r\n\r\nThis day, August 8th, 1794, I have seen a negro, who was born (as he\r\nreports) of black parents, both father and mother, at Kingston in Jamaica,\r\nwho has many large white blotches on the skin of his limbs and body; which\r\nI thought felt not so soft to the finger, as the black parts. He has a\r\nwhite divergent blaze from the summit of his nose to the vertex of his\r\nhead; the upper part of which, where it extends on the hairy scalp, has\r\nthick curled hair, like the other part of his head, but quite white. By\r\nthese marks I supposed him to be the same black, who is described, when\r\nonly two years old, in the Transactions of the American Philosophical\r\nSociety, Vol. II. page 292, where a female one is likewise described with\r\nnearly similar marks.\r\n\r\nThe joining of the frontal bones, and the bregma, having been later than\r\nthat of the other sutures of the cranium, probably gave cause to the\r\nwhiteness of the hair on these parts by delaying or impeding its growth.\r\n\r\nADDITION II.\r\n\r\nThe following extract from a letter of Dr. Beddoes on hydrocephalus\r\ninternus, I esteem a valuable addition to the article on that subject at\r\nClass I. 2. 3. 12.\r\n\r\n    \"Master L----, aged 9 years, became suddenly ill in the night about a\r\n    week before I saw him. On the day before the attack, he had taken\r\n    opening medicines, and had bathed afterwards. He had complained of\r\n    violently acute pain in his head, shrieked frequently, ground his teeth\r\n    hard, could not bear to have his head raised from the pillow, and was\r\n    torpid or deaf. His tongue was white, pulse 110 in the evening and\r\n    full. As yet the pupil of the eye was irritable, and he had no\r\n    strabismus. He had been bled with leeches about the head, and\r\n    blistered. I directed mercurial inunction, and calomel from 3 to 6\r\n    grains to be taken at first every six, and afterwards every three\r\n    hours. This plan produced no sensible effect, and the patient died on\r\n    the 18th day after the seizure. He had convulsion fits two days\r\n    preceding his death, and the well-known symptoms of hydrocephalus\r\n    internus all made their appearance. From what I had seen and read of\r\n    this disease, I believed it to belong to inflammations, and at an\r\n    earlier period I should be tempted to bleed as largely as for\r\n    pneumonia. The fluid found after death in the ventricules of the brain\r\n    I impute to debility of the absorbents induced by inflammation. My\r\n    reasons are briefly these; 1. The acuteness of the pain. 2. The state\r\n    of the pulse. In the above case for the first 9 or 10 days it did not\r\n    exceed 110, and was full and strong.\r\n\r\n    3. To find out whether any febrile alternations took place, Master L.'s\r\n    feet were frequently felt, and they were found at times cold, and at\r\n    other times of a dry heat. I have many times seen this disease, but the\r\n    patients were too young, or too far advanced, to inform me, whether\r\n    they had chillness succeeded by heat at its onset. 4. The disorders to\r\n    which the young are more peculiarly liable afford a presumption, that\r\n    hydrocephalus internus is an inflammatory disease; and this is\r\n    confirmed by the regularity of the period, within which it finishes its\r\n    course. And lastly, does it not happen more frequently than is\r\n    suspected from external injury?\r\n\r\n    I have just now been well informed, that Dr. Rush has lately cured five\r\n    out of six patients by copious bleedings. I relate here the reasons for\r\n    an opinion without pretending to a discovery. Something like this\r\n    doctrine may be found in certain modern publications, but it is\r\n    delivered in that vague and diffuse style, which I trust your example\r\n    will banish from medical literature.\"\r\n\r\n      Clifton, near Bristol,\r\n      _July 28, 1795_.\r\n\r\nTo this idea of Dr. Beddoes may be added, that the hydrocele generally\r\nsucceeds an injury, and consequent inflammation of the bag, which contains\r\nit. And that other dropsies, which principally attend inebriates, are\r\nconsequent to too great action of the mucous membranes by the stimulus of\r\nbeer, wine, and spirits. And lastly, that as these cases of hydrocephalus\r\nend so fatally, a new mode of treating them is much to be desired, and\r\ndeserves to be seriously attended to.\r\n\r\nADDITION III. ON VERTIGO.\r\n\r\n_To be placed after the additional Note at the end of Vol. I. on this\r\nSubject._\r\n\r\nHaving reperused the ingenious Essay of Dr. Wells on Single Vision, and his\r\nadditional observations in the Gentleman's Magazine on the apparent\r\nretrogression of objects in vertigo, I am induced to believe, that this\r\napparent retrogression of objects is not always owing to the same cause.\r\n\r\nWhen a person revolves with his eyes closed, till he becomes vertiginous,\r\nand then stands still without opening them, he seems for a while to go\r\nforward in the same direction. This hallucination of his ideas cannot be\r\nowing to ocular spectra, because, as Dr. Wells observes, no such can have\r\nbeen formed; but it must arise from a similar continuance or repetition of\r\nideas belonging to the sense of touch, instead of to the sense of vision;\r\nand should therefore be called a tangible, not a visual, vertigo. In common\r\nlanguage this belief of continuing to revolve for some time, after he\r\nstands still, when a person has turned round for a minute in the dark,\r\nwould be called a deception of imagination.\r\n\r\nNow at this time if he opens his eyes upon a gilt book, placed with other\r\nbooks on a shelf about the height of his eye, the gilt book seems to recede\r\nin the contrary direction; though his eyes are at this time kept quite\r\nstill, as well as the gilt book. For if his eyes were not kept still, other\r\nbooks would fall on them in succession; which, when I repeatedly made the\r\nexperiment, did not occur; and which thus evinces, that no motion of the\r\neyes is the cause of the apparent retrocession of the gilt book. Why then\r\ndoes it happen?--Certainly from an hallucination of ideas, or in common\r\nlanguage the deception of imagination.\r\n\r\nThe vertiginous person still imagines, that he continues to revolve\r\nforwards, after he has opened his eyes; and in consequence that the\r\nobjects, which his eyes happen to fall upon, are revolving backward; as\r\nthey would appear to do, if he was actually turning round with his eyes\r\nopen. For he has been accustomed to observe the motions of bodies, whether\r\napparent or real, so much more frequently by the eye than by the touch;\r\nthat the present belief of his gyration, occasioned by the hallucinations\r\nof the sense of touch, is attended with ideas of such imagined motions of\r\nvisible objects, as have always accompanied his former gyrations, and have\r\nthus been associated with the muscular actions and perceptions of touch,\r\nwhich occurred at the same time.\r\n\r\nWhen the remains of colours are seen in the eye, they are termed ocular\r\nspectra; when remaining sounds are heard in the ear, they may be called\r\nauricular murmurs; but when the remaining motions, or ideas, of the sense\r\nof touch continue, as in this vertigo of a blindfolded person, they have\r\nacquired no name, but may be termed evanescent titillations, or tangible\r\nhallucinations.\r\n\r\nWhence I conclude, that vertigo may have for its cause either the ocular\r\nspectra of the sense of vision, when a person revolves with his eyes open;\r\nor the auricular murmurs of the sense of hearing, if he is revolved near a\r\ncascade; or the evanescent titillations of the sense of touch, if he\r\nrevolves blindfold. All these I should wish to call vanishing ideas, or\r\nsensual motions, of those organs of sense; which, ideas, or sensual\r\nmotions, have lately been associated in a circle, and therefore for a time\r\ncontinue to be excited. And what are the ideas of colours, when they are\r\nexcited by imagination or memory, but the repetition of finer ocular\r\nspectra? What the idea of sounds, but the repetition of finer auricular\r\nmurmurs? And what the ideas of tangible objects, but the repetition of\r\nfiner evanescent titillations?\r\n\r\nThe tangible, and the auricular, and the visual vertigo, are all perceived\r\nby many people for a day or two after long travelling in a boat or coach;\r\nthe motions of the vessel, or vehicle, or of the surrounding objects, and\r\nthe noise of the wheels and oars, occur at intervals of reverie, or at the\r\ncommencement of sleep. See Sect. XX. 5. These ideas, or sensual motions, of\r\nsight, of hearing, and of touch, are succeeded by the same effects as the\r\nocular spectra, the auricular murmurs, and the evanescent titillations\r\nabove mentioned; that is, by a kind of vertigo, and cannot in that respect\r\nbe distinguished from them. Which is a further confirmation of the truth of\r\nthe doctrine delivered in Sect. III. of this work, that the colours\r\nremaining in the eyes, which are termed ocular spectra, are ideas, or\r\nsensual motions, belonging to the sense of vision, which for too long a\r\ntime continue their activity.\r\n\r\nADDITION IV. OF VOLUNTARY MOTIONS.\r\n\r\nA correspondent acquaints me, that he finds difficulty in understanding how\r\nthe convulsions of the limbs in epilepsy can be induced by voluntary\r\nexertions. This I suspect first to have arisen from the double meaning of\r\nthe words \"involuntary motions;\" which are sometimes used for those\r\nmotions, which are performed without the interference of volition, as the\r\npulsations of the heart and arteries; and at other times for those actions,\r\nwhich occur, where two counter volitions oppose each other, and the\r\nstronger prevails; as in endeavouring to suppress laughter, and to stop the\r\nshudderings, when exposed to cold. Thus when the poet writes,\r\n\r\n  ------video meliora, proboque,\r\n  Deteriora sequor.----\r\n\r\nThe stronger volition actuates the system, but not without the\r\ncounteraction of unavailing smaller ones; which constitute deliberation.\r\n\r\nA second difficulty may have arisen from the confined use of the words \"to\r\nwill,\" which in common discourse generally mean to choose after\r\ndeliberation; and hence our will or volition is supposed to be always in\r\nour own power. But the will or voluntary power, acts always from motive, as\r\nexplained in Sect. XXXIV. 1. and in Class IV. 1. 3. 2. and III. 2. 1. 12.\r\nwhich motive can frequently be examined previous to action, and balanced\r\nagainst opposite motives, which is called deliberation; at other times the\r\nmotive is so powerful as immediately to excite the sensorial power of\r\nvolition into action, without a previous balancing of opposite motives, or\r\ncounter volitions. The former of these volitions is exercised in the common\r\npurposes of life, and the latter in the exertions of epilepsy and insanity.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult _to think without words_, which however all those must do,\r\nwho discover new truths by reasoning; and still more difficult, when the\r\nwords in common use deceive us by their twofold meanings, or by the\r\ninaccuracy of the ideas, which they suggest.\r\n\r\nADDITION V. OF FIGURE.\r\n\r\nI feel myself much obliged by the accurate attention given to the first\r\nvolume of Zoonomia, and by the ingenious criticisms bestowed on it, by the\r\nlearned writers of that article both in the Analytical and English Reviews.\r\nSome circumstances, in which their sentiments do not accord with those\r\nexpressed in the work, I intend to reconsider, and to explain further at\r\nsome future time. One thing, in which both these gentlemen seem to dissent\r\nfrom me, I shall now mention, it is concerning the manner, in which we\r\nacquire the idea of figure; a circumstance of great importance in the\r\nknowledge of our intellect, as it shews the cause of the accuracy of our\r\nideas of motion, time, space, number, and of the mathematical sciences,\r\nwhich are concerned in the mensurations or proportions of figure.\r\n\r\nThis I imagine may have in part arisen from the prepossession, which has\r\nalmost universally prevailed, that ideas are immaterial beings, and\r\ntherefore possess no properties in common with solid matter. Which I\r\nsuppose to be a fanciful hypothesis, like the stories of ghosts and\r\napparitions, which have so long amused, and still amuse, the credulous\r\nwithout any foundation in nature.\r\n\r\nThe existence of our own bodies, and of their solidity, and of their\r\nfigure, and of their motions, is taken for granted in my account of ideas;\r\nbecause the ideas themselves are believed to consist of motions or\r\nconfigurations of solid fibres; and the question now proposed is, how we\r\nbecome acquainted with the figures of bodies external to our organs of\r\nsense? Which I can only repeat from what is mentioned in Sect. XIV. 2. 2.\r\nthat if part of an organ of sense be stimulated into action, as of the\r\nsense of touch, that part so stimulated into action must possess figure,\r\nwhich must be similar to the figure of the body, which stimulates it.\r\n\r\nAnother previous prepossession of the mind, which may have rendered the\r\nmanner of our acquiring the knowledge of figure less intelligible, may have\r\narisen from the common opinion of the perceiving faculty residing in the\r\nhead; whereas our daily experience shews, that our perception (which\r\nconsists of an idea, and of the pleasure or pain it occasions) exists\r\nprincipally in the organ of sense, which is stimulated into action; as\r\nevery one, who burns his finger in the candle, must be bold to deny.\r\n\r\nWhen an ivory triangle is pressed on the palm of the hand, the figure of\r\nthe surface of the part of the organ of touch thus compressed is a\r\ntriangle, resembling in figure the figure of the external body, which\r\ncompresses it. The action of the stimulated fibres, which constitute the\r\nidea of hardness and of figure, remains in this part of the sensorium,\r\nwhich forms the sense of touch; but the sensorial motion, which constitutes\r\npleasure or pain, and which is excited in consequence of these fibrous\r\nmotions of the organ of sense, is propagated to the central parts of the\r\nsensorium, or to the whole of it; though this generally occurs in less\r\ndegree of energy, than it exists in the stimulated organ of sense; as in\r\nthe instance above mentioned of burning a finger in the candle.\r\n\r\nSome, who have espoused the doctrine of the immateriality of ideas, have\r\nseriously doubted the existence of a material world, with which only our\r\nsenses acquaint us; and yet have assented to the existence of spirit, with\r\nwhich our senses cannot acquaint us; and have finally allowed, that all our\r\nknowledge is derived through the medium of our senses! They forget, that if\r\nthe spirit of animation had no properties in common with matter, it could\r\nneither affect nor be affected by the material body. But the knowledge of\r\nour own material existence being granted, which I suspect few rational\r\npersons will seriously deny, the existence of a material external world\r\nfollows in course; as our perceptions, when we are awake and not insane,\r\nare distinguished from those excited by sensation, as in our dreams, and\r\nfrom those excited by volition or by association as in insanity and\r\nreverie, by the power we have of comparing the present perceptions of one\r\nsense with those of another, as explained in Sect. XIV. 2. 5. And also by\r\ncomparing the tribes of ideas, which the symbols of pictures, or of\r\nlanguages, suggest to us, by intuitive analogy with our previous\r\nexperience, that is, with the common course of nature. See Class III. 2. 2.\r\n3. on Credulity.\r\n\r\nADDITION VI.\r\n\r\n_Please to add the following in page 14, after line 20._\r\n\r\n_Cold and hot Fit._\r\n\r\nAs the torpor, with which a fit of fever commences, is sometimes owing to\r\ndefect of stimulus, as in going into the cold-bath; and sometimes to a\r\nprevious exhaustion of the sensorial power by the action of some violent\r\nstimulus, as after coming out of a hot room into cold air; a longer time\r\nmust elapse, before there can be a sufficient accumulation of sensorial\r\npower to produce a hot fit in one case than in the other. Because in the\r\nlatter case the quantity of sensorial power previously expended must be\r\nsupplied, before an accumulation can begin.\r\n\r\nThe cold paroxysm commences, when the torpor of a part becomes so great,\r\nand its motions in consequence so slow or feeble, as not to excite the\r\nsensorial power of association; which in health contributes to move the\r\nrest of the system, which is catenated with it. And the hot fit commences\r\nby the accumulation of the sensorial power of irritation of the part first\r\naffected, either so as to counteract its deficient stimulus, or its\r\nprevious waste of sensorial power; and it becomes general by the\r\naccumulation of the sensorial power of association; which is excited by the\r\nrenovated actions of the part first affected; or becomes so great as to\r\noverbalance the deficient excitement of it. On all these accounts the hot\r\nfit cannot be supposed to bear any proportion to the cold one in length of\r\ntime, though the latter may be the consequence of the former. See Suppl. I.\r\n16. 8.\r\n\r\nADDITION VII. ON WARMTH.\r\n\r\n_To be added at the end of the Species Sudor Calidus, in Class I. 1. 2. 3._\r\n\r\nWhen the heat of the body in weak patients in fevers is increased by the\r\nstimulus of the points of flannel, a greater consequent debility succeeds,\r\nthan when it is produced by the warmth of fire; as in the former the heat\r\nis in part owing to the increased activity of the skin, and consequent\r\nexpenditure of sensorial power; whereas in the latter case it is in part\r\nowing to the influx of the fluid matter of heat.\r\n\r\nSo the warmth produced by equitation, or by rubbing the body and limbs with\r\na smooth brush or hand, as is done after bathing in some parts of the East,\r\ndoes not expend nearly so much sensorial power, as when the warmth is\r\nproduced by the locomotion of the whole weight of the body by muscular\r\naction, as in walking, or running, or swimming. Whence the warmth of a fire\r\nis to be preferred to flannel shirts for weak people, and the agitation of\r\na horse to exercise on foot. And I suppose those, who are unfortunately\r\nlost in snow, who are on foot, are liable to perish sooner by being\r\nexhausted by their muscular exertions; and might frequently preserve\r\nthemselves by lying on the ground, and covering themselves with snow,\r\nbefore they were too much exhausted by fatigue. See Botan. Garden, Vol. II.\r\nthe note on Barometz.\r\n\r\nADDITION VIII. PUERPERAL FEVER.\r\n\r\n_To be added to Class II. 1. 6. 16._\r\n\r\nA very interesting account of the puerperal fever, which was epidemic at\r\nAberdeen, has been lately published by Dr. Alexander Gordon. (Robinson,\r\nLondon.) In several dissections of those, who died of this disease,\r\npurulent matter was found in the cavity of the abdomen; which he ascribes\r\nto an erysipelatous inflammation of the peritonæum, as its principal seat,\r\nand of its productions, as the omentum, mesentery, and peritonæal coat of\r\nthe intestines.\r\n\r\nHe believes, that it was infectious, and that the contagion was always\r\ncarried by the accoucheur or the nurse from one lying-in woman to another.\r\n\r\nThe disease began with violent unremitting pain of the abdomen on the day\r\nof delivery, or the next day, with shuddering, and very quick pulse, often\r\n140 in a minute. In this situation, if he saw the patient within 12 or 24\r\nhours of her seizure, he took away from 16 to 24 ounces of blood, which was\r\nalways sizy. He then immediately gave a cathartic consisting of three\r\ngrains of calomel, and 40 grains of powder of jalap. After this had\r\noperated, he gave an opiate at night; and continued the purging and the\r\nopiate for several days.\r\n\r\nHe asserts, that almost all those, whom he was permitted to treat in this\r\nmanner early in the disease, recovered to the number of 50; and that almost\r\nall the rest died. But that when two or three days were elapsed, the\r\npatient became too weak for this method; and the matter was already formed,\r\nwhich destroyed them. Except that he saw two patients, who recovered after\r\ndischarging a large quantity of matter at the navel. And a few, who were\r\nrelieved by the appearance of external erysipelas on the extremities.\r\n\r\nThis disease, consisting of an erysipelatous inflammation, may occasion the\r\ngreat debility sooner to occur than in inflammation of the uterus; which\r\nlatter is neither erysipelatous, I suppose, nor contagious. And the success\r\nof Dr. Gordon's practice seems to correspond with that of Dr. Rush in the\r\ncontagious fever or plague at Philadelphia; which appeared to be much\r\nassisted by early evacuations. One case I saw some time ago, where violent\r\nunceasing pain of the whole abdomen occurred a few hours after delivery,\r\nwith quick pulse; which ceased after the patient had twice lost about eight\r\nounces of blood, and had taken a moderate cathartic with calomel.\r\n\r\nThis case induces me to think, that it might be safer and equally\r\nefficacious, to take less blood at first, than Dr. Gordon mentions, and to\r\nrepeat the operation in a few hours, if the continuance of the symptoms\r\nshould require it. And the same in respect to the cathartic, which might\r\nperhaps be given in less quantity, and repeated every two or three hours.\r\n\r\nNor should I wish to give an opiate after the first venesection and\r\ncathartic; as I suspect that this might be injurious, except those\r\nevacuations had emptied the vessels so much, that the stimulus of the\r\nopiate should act only by increasing the absorption of the new vessels or\r\nfluids produced on the surfaces of the inflamed membranes. In other\r\ninflammations of the bowels, and in acute rheumatism, I have seen the\r\ndisease much prolonged, and I believe sometimes rendered fatal, by the too\r\nearly administration of opiates, either along with cathartics, or at their\r\nintervals; while a small dose of opium given after sufficient evacuations\r\nproduces absorption only by its stimulus, and much contributes to the cure\r\nof the patient. We may have visible testimony of this effect of opium, when\r\na solution of it is put into an inflamed eye; if it be thus used previous\r\nto sufficient evacuation, it increases the inflammation; if it be used\r\nafter sufficient evacuation, it increases absorption only, and clears the\r\neye in a very small time.\r\n\r\nI cannot omit observing, from considering these circumstances, how unwise\r\nis the common practice of giving an opiate to every woman immediately after\r\nher delivery, which must often have been of dangerous consequence.\r\n\r\nEND OF THE SECOND PART.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nZOONOMIÆ AUCTORI\r\n\r\n_S.P.D._\r\n\r\nAMICUS.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_CURRUS TRIUMPHALIS MEDICINÆ._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Currus it Hygeiæ, Medicus movet arma triumphans,\r\n    Undique victa fugit lurida turma mali.----\r\n  Laurea dum Phoebi viridis tua tempora cingit,\r\n    Nec mortale sonans Fama coronat opus;\r\n  Post equitat trepidans, repetitque Senectus in aurem,\r\n    Voce canens stridulà, \"sis memor ipse mori!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX OF THE CLASSES.\r\n\r\n                  A.\r\n\r\n  Abortion, i. 2. 1. 14.\r\n  ---- from fear, iv. 3. 1. 7.\r\n  ---- not from epilepsy, iii. 1. 1. 7.\r\n  ---- not from hepatitis, ii. 1. 2. 12.\r\n  Absorption of solids, i. 2. 2. 14.\r\n  ---- of matter, ii. 1. 6. 2. and 6.\r\n  ---- cellular, iv. 1. 1. 6.\r\n  ---- from the lungs, iv. 3. 1. 5.

NUTRIENTIA, or those things which preserve in their natural state the\r\ndue exertions of all the irritative motions.\r\n\r\n2. INCITANTIA, or those things which increase the exertions of all the\r\nirritative motions.\r\n\r\n3.

INVERTENTIA, or those things which invert the natural order of the\r\nsuccessive irritative motions.\r\n\r\n6. REVERTENTIA, or those things which restore the natural order of the\r\ninverted irritative motions.\r\n\r\n7. TORPENTIA, those things which diminish the exertions of all the\r\nirritative motions.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to apprize the reader, that in the following account of the\r\nvirtues of Medicines their usual doses are always supposed to be exhibited;\r\nand the patient to be exposed to the degree of exterior heat, which he has\r\nbeen accustomed to, (where the contrary is not mentioned), as any variation\r\nof either of these circumstances varies their effects.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLES\r\n\r\nOF THE\r\n\r\nMATERIA MEDICA.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nART. I.\r\n\r\nNUTRIENTIA.\r\n\r\nI. 1. Those things, which preserve in their natural state the due exertions\r\nof all the irritative motions, are termed nutrientia; they produce the\r\ngrowth, and restore the waste, of the system. These consist of a variety of\r\nmild vegetable and animal substances, water, and air.\r\n\r\n2. Where stronger stimuli have been long used, they become necessary for\r\nthis purpose, as mustard, spice, salt, beer, wine, vinegar, alcohol, opium.\r\nWhich however, as they are unnatural stimuli, and difficult to manage in\r\nrespect to quantity, are liable to shorten the span of human life, sooner\r\nrendering the system incapable of being stimulated into action by the\r\nnutrientia. See Sect XXXVII. 4. On the same account life is shorter in\r\nwarmer climates than in more temperate ones.\r\n\r\nII. OBSERVATIONS ON THE NUTRIENTIA.\r\n\r\nI. 1. The flesh of animals contains more nourishment, and stimulates our\r\nabsorbent and secerning vessels more powerfully, than the vegetable\r\nproductions, which we use as food; for the carnivorous animals can fast\r\nlonger without injury than the graminivorous; and we feel ourselves warmer\r\nand stronger after a meal of flesh than of grain. Hence in diseases\r\nattended with cold extremities and general debility this kind of diet is\r\npreferred; as in rickets, dropsy, scrophula, and in hysteric and\r\nhypochondriac cases, and to prevent the returns of agues. Might not flesh\r\nin small quantities bruised to a pulp be more advantageously used in fevers\r\nattended with debility than vegetable diet?\r\n\r\nThat flesh, which is of the darkest colour, generally contains more\r\nnourishment, and stimulates our vessels more powerfully, than the white\r\nkinds. The flesh of the carnivorous and piscivorous animals is so\r\nstimulating, that it seldom enters into the food of European nations,\r\nexcept the swine, the Soland goose (Pelicanus Bassanus), and formerly the\r\nswan. Of these the swine and the swan are fed previously upon vegetable\r\naliment; and the Soland goose is taken in very small quantity, only as a\r\nwhet to the appetite. Next to these are the birds, that feed upon insects,\r\nwhich are perhaps the most stimulating and the most nutritive of our usual\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nIt is said that a greater quantity of volatile alkali can be obtained from\r\nthis kind of flesh, to which has been ascribed its stimulating quality. But\r\nit is more probable, that fresh flesh contains only the elements of\r\nvolatile alkali.\r\n\r\n2. Next to the dark coloured flesh of animals, the various tribes of\r\nshell-fish seem to claim their place, and the wholesome kinds of mushrooms,\r\nwhich must be esteemed animal food, both for their alkalescent tendency,\r\ntheir stimulating quality, and the quantity of nourishment, which they\r\nafford; as oysters, lobsters, crabfish, shrimps; mushrooms; to which\r\nperhaps might be added some of the fish without scales; as the eel,\r\nbarbolt, tench, smelt, turbot, turtle.\r\n\r\nThe flesh of many kinds of fish, when it is supposed to have undergone a\r\nbeginning putrefaction, becomes luminous in the dark. This seems to shew a\r\ntendency in the phosphorus to escape, and combine with the oxygen of the\r\natmosphere; and would hence shew, that this kind of flesh is not so\r\nperfectly animalized as those before mentioned. This light, as it is\r\nfrequently seen on rotten wood, and sometimes on veal, which has been kept\r\ntoo long, as I have been told, is commonly supposed to have its cause from\r\nputrefaction; but is nevertheless most probably of phosphoric origin, like\r\nthat seen in the dark on oyster-shells, which have previously been ignited,\r\nand afterwards exposed to the sunshine, and on the Bolognian stone. See\r\nBotan. Gard. Vol. I. Cant. I. line 1 and 2, the note.\r\n\r\n3. The flesh of young animals, as of lamb, veal, and sucking pigs, supplies\r\nus with a still less stimulating food. The broth of these is said to become\r\nsour, and continues so a considerable time before it changes into\r\nputridity; so much does their flesh partake of the chemical properties of\r\nthe milk, with which these animals are nourished.\r\n\r\n4. The white meats, as of turkey, partridge, pheasant, fowl, with their\r\neggs, seem to be the next in mildness; and hence are generally first\r\nallowed to convalescents from inflammatory diseases.\r\n\r\n5. Next to those should be ranked the white river-fish, which have scales,\r\nas pike, perch, gudgeon.\r\n\r\nII. 1. Milk unites the animal with the vegetable source of our nourishment,\r\npartaking of the properties of both. As it contains sugar, and will\r\ntherefore ferment and produce a kind of wine or spirit, which is a common\r\nliquor in Siberia; or will run into an acid by simple agitation, as in the\r\nchurning of cream; and lastly, as it contains coagulable lymph, which will\r\nundergo the process of putrefaction like other animal substances, as in old\r\ncheese.\r\n\r\n2. Milk may be separated by rest or by agitation into cream, butter,\r\nbutter-milk, whey, curd. The cream is easier of digestion to adults,\r\nbecause it contains less of the coagulum or cheesy part, and is also more\r\nnutritive. Butter consisting of oil between an animal and vegetable kind\r\ncontains still more nutriment, and in its recent state is not difficult of\r\ndigestion if taken in moderate quantity. See Art. I. 2. 3. 2. Butter-milk\r\nif it be not bitter is an agreeable and nutritive fluid, if it be bitter it\r\nhas some putrid parts of the cream in it, which had been kept too long; but\r\nis perhaps not less wholesome for being sour to a certain degree: as the\r\ninferior people in Scotland choose sour milk in preference to skimmed milk\r\nbefore it is become sour. Whey is the least nutritive and easiest of\r\ndigestion. And in the spring of the year, when the cows feed on young\r\ngrass, it contains so much of vegetable properties, as to become a salutary\r\npotation, when drank to about a pint every morning to those, who during the\r\nwinter have taken too little vegetable nourishment, and who are thence\r\nliable to bilious concretions.\r\n\r\n3. Cheese is of various kinds, according to the greater or less quantity of\r\ncream, which it contains, and according to its age. Those cheeses, which\r\nare easiest broken to pieces in the mouth, are generally easiest of\r\ndigestion, and contain most nutriment. Some kinds of cheese, though slow of\r\ndigestion, are also slow in changing by chemical processes in the stomach,\r\nand therefore will frequently agree well with those, who have a weak\r\ndigestion; as I have seen toasted cheese vomited up a whole day after it\r\nwas eaten without having undergone any apparent change, or given any\r\nuneasiness to the patient. It is probable a portion of sugar, or of animal\r\nfat, or of the gravy of boiled or roasted meat, mixed with cheese at the\r\ntime of making it, might add to its pleasant and nutritious quality.\r\n\r\n4. The reason, why autumnal milk is so much thicker or coagulable than\r\nvernal milk, is not easy to understand, but as new milk is in many respects\r\nsimilar to chyle, it may be considered as food already in part digested by\r\nthe animal it is taken from, and thence supplies a nutriment of easy\r\ndigestion. But as it requires to be curdled by the gastric acid, before it\r\ncan enter the lacteals, as is seen in the stomachs of calves, it seems more\r\nsuitable to children, whose stomachs abound more with acidity, than to\r\nadults; but nevertheless supplies good nourishment to many of the latter,\r\nand particularly to those, who use vegetable food, and whose stomachs have\r\nnot been much accustomed to the unnatural stimulus of spice, salt, and\r\nspirit. See Class I. 1. 2. 5.\r\n\r\nIII. 1. The seeds, roots, leaves, and fruits of plants, constitute the\r\ngreatest part of the food of mankind; the respective quantities of\r\nnourishment, which these contain, may perhaps be estimated from the\r\nquantity of starch, or of sugar, they can be made to produce: in\r\nfarinaceous seeds, the mucilage seems gradually to be converted into\r\nstarch, while they remain in our granaries; and the starch by the\r\ngermination of the young plant, as in making malt from barley, or by animal\r\ndigestion, is converted into sugar. Hence old wheat and beans contain more\r\nstarch than new; and in our stomachs other vegetable and animal materials\r\nare converted into sugar; which constitutes in all creatures a part of\r\ntheir chyle.\r\n\r\nHence it is probable, that sugar is the most nutritive part of vegetables;\r\nand that they are more nutritive, as they are convertible in greater\r\nquantity into sugar by the power of digestion; as appears from sugar being\r\nfound in the chyle of all animals, and from its existing in great quantity\r\nin the urine of patients in the diabætes, of which a curious case is\r\nrelated in Sect. XXIX. 4. where a man labouring under this malady eat and\r\ndrank an enormous quantity, and sometimes voided sixteen pints of water in\r\na day, with an ounce of sugar in each pint.\r\n\r\n2. Oil, when mixed with mucilage or coagulable lymph, as in cream or new\r\nmilk, is easy of digestion, and constitutes probably the most nutritive\r\npart of animal diet; as oil is another part of the chyle of all animals. As\r\nthese two materials, sugar and butter, contain much nutriment under a small\r\nvolume, and readily undergo some chemical change so as to become acid or\r\nrancid; they are liable to disturb weak stomachs, when taken in large\r\nquantity, more than aliment, which contains less nourishment, and is at the\r\nsame time less liable to chemical changes; because the chyle is produced\r\nquicker than the torpid lacteals can absorb it, and thence undergoes a\r\nfurther chemical process. Sugar and butter therefore are not so easily\r\ndigested, when taken in large quantity, as those things, which contain less\r\nnutriment; hence, where the stomach is weak, they must be used in less\r\nquantity. But the custom of some people in restraining children entirely\r\nfrom them, is depriving them of a very wholesome, agreeable, and\r\nsubstantial part of their diet. Honey, manna, sap-juice, are different\r\nkinds of less pure sugar.\r\n\r\n3. All the esculent vegetables contain a bland oil, or mucilage, or starch,\r\nor sugar, or acid; and, as their stimulus is moderate, are properly given\r\nalone as food in inflammatory diseases; and mixed with milk constitute the\r\nfood of thousands. Other vegetables possess various degrees and various\r\nkinds of stimulus; and to these we are beholden for the greater part of our\r\nMateria Medica, which produce nausea, sickness, vomiting, catharsis,\r\nintoxication, inflammation, and even death, if unskilfully administered.\r\n\r\nThe acrid or intoxicating, and other kinds of vegetable juices, such as\r\nproduce sickness, or evacuate the bowels, or such even as are only\r\ndisagreeable to the palate, appear to be a part of the defence of those\r\nvegetables, which possess them, from the assaults of larger animals or of\r\ninsects. As mentioned in the Botanic Garden, Part II. Cant. I. line 161,\r\nnote. This appears in a forcible manner from the perusal of some travels,\r\nwhich have been published of those unfortunate people, who have suffered\r\nshipwreck on uncultivated countries, and have with difficulty found food to\r\nsubsist, in otherwise not inhospitable climates.\r\n\r\n4. As these acrid and intoxicating juices generally reside in the mucilage,\r\nand not in the starch of many roots, and seeds, according to the\r\nobservation of M. Parmentier, the wholesome or nutritive parts of some\r\nvegetables may be thus separated from the medicinal parts of them. Thus if\r\nthe root of white briony be rasped into cold water, by means of a\r\nbread-grater made of a tinned iron plate, and agitated in it, the acrid\r\njuice of the root along with the mucilage will be dissolved, or swim, in\r\nthe water; while a starch perfectly wholesome and nutritious will subside,\r\nand may be used as food in times of scarcity.\r\n\r\nM. Parmentier further observes, that potatoes contain too much mucilage in\r\nproportion to their starch, which prevents them from being converted into\r\ngood bread. But that if the starch be collected from ten pounds of raw\r\npotatoes by grating them into cold water, and agitating them, as above\r\nmentioned; and if the starch thus procured be mixed with other ten pounds\r\nof boiled potatoes, and properly subjected to fermentation like wheat\r\nflour, that it will make as good bread as the finest wheat.\r\n\r\nGood bread may also be made by mixing wheat-flour with boiled potatoes.\r\nEighteen pounds of wheat flour are said to make twenty-two pounds and a\r\nhalf of bread. Eighteen pounds of wheat-flour mixed with nine pounds of\r\nboiled potatoes, are said to make twenty-nine pounds and a half of bread.\r\nThis difference of weight must arise from the difference of the previous\r\ndryness of the two materials. The potatoes might probably make better\r\nflour, if they were boiled in steam, in a close vessel, made some degrees\r\nhotter than common boiling water.\r\n\r\nOther vegetable matters may be deprived of their too great acrimony by\r\nboiling in water, as the great variety of the cabbage, the young tops of\r\nwhite briony, water-cresses, asparagus, with innumerable roots, and some\r\nfruits. Other plants have their acrid juices or bitter particles diminished\r\nby covering them from the light by what is termed blanching them, as the\r\nstems and leaves of cellery, endive, sea-kale. The former method either\r\nextracts or decomposes the acrid particles, and the latter prevents them\r\nfrom being formed. See Botanic Garden, Vol. I. additional note XXXIV. on\r\nthe Etiolation of vegetables.\r\n\r\n5. The art of cookery, by exposing vegetable and animal substances to heat,\r\nhas contributed to increase the quantity of the food of mankind by other\r\nmeans besides that of destroying their acrimony. One of these is by\r\nconverting the acerb juices of some fruits into sugar, as in the baking of\r\nunripe pears, and the bruising of unripe apples; in both which situations\r\nthe life of the vegetable is destroyed, and the conversion of the harsh\r\njuice into a sweet one must be performed by a chemical process; and not by\r\na vegetable one only, as the germination of barley in making malt has\r\ngenerally been supposed.\r\n\r\nSome circumstances, which seem to injure the life of several fruits, seem\r\nto forward the saccharine process of their juices. Thus if some kinds of\r\npears are gathered a week before they would ripen on the tree, and are laid\r\non a heap and covered, their juice becomes sweet many days sooner. The\r\ntaking off a circular piece of the bark from a branch of a pear-tree causes\r\nthe fruit of that branch to ripen sooner by a fortnight, as I have more\r\nthan once observed. The wounds made in apples by insects occasion those\r\napples to ripen sooner; caprification, or the piercing of figs, in the\r\nisland of Malta, is said to ripen them sooner; and I am well informed, that\r\nwhen bunches of grapes in this country have acquired their expected size,\r\nthat if the stalk of each bunch be cut half through, that they will sooner\r\nripen.\r\n\r\nThe germinating barley in the malt-house I believe acquires little\r\nsweetness, till the life of the seed is destroyed, and the saccharine\r\nprocess then continued or advanced by the heat in drying it. Thus in animal\r\ndigestion, the sugar produced in the stomach is absorbed by the lacteals as\r\nfast as it is made, otherwise it ferments, and produces flatulency; so in\r\nthe germination of barley in the malt-house, so long as the new plant\r\nlives, the sugar, I suppose, is absorbed as fast as it is made; but that,\r\nwhich we use in making beer, is the sugar produced by a chemical process\r\nafter the death of the young plant, or which is made more expeditiously,\r\nthan the plant can absorb it.\r\n\r\nIt is probably this saccharine process, which obtains in new hay-stacks too\r\nhastily, and which by immediately running into fermentation produces so\r\nmuch heat as to set them on fire. The greatest part of the grain, or seeds,\r\nor roots, used in the distilleries, as wheat, canary seed, potatoes, are\r\nnot I believe previously subjected to germination, but are in part by a\r\nchemical process converted into sugar, and immediately subjected to vinous\r\nfermentation; and it is probable a process may sometime be discovered of\r\nproducing sugar from starch or meal; and of separating it from them for\r\ndomestic purposes by alcohol, which dissolves sugar but not mucilage; or by\r\nother means.\r\n\r\nAnother method of increasing the nutriment of mankind by cookery, is by\r\ndissolving cartilages and bones, and tendons, and probably some vegetables,\r\nin steam or water at a much higher degree of heat than that of boiling.\r\nThis is to be done in a close vessel, which is called Papin's digester; in\r\nwhich, it is said, that water may be made red-hot, and will then dissolve\r\nall animal substances; and might thus add to our quantity of food in times\r\nof scarcity. This vessel should be made of iron, and should have an oval\r\nopening at top, with an oval lid of iron larger than the aperture; this lid\r\nshould be slipped in endways, when the vessel is filled, and then turned,\r\nand raised by a screw above it into contact with the under edges of the\r\naperture. There should also be a small tube or hole covered with a weighted\r\nvalve to prevent the danger of bursting the digester.\r\n\r\nWhere the powers of digestion are weakened, broths made by boiling animal\r\nand vegetable substances in water afford a nutriment; though I suppose not\r\nso great as the flesh and vegetables would afford, if taken in their solid\r\nform, and mixed with saliva in the act of mastication. The aliment thus\r\nprepared should be boiled but a short time, nor should be suffered to\r\ncontinue in our common kitchen-utensils afterwards, as they are lined with\r\na mixture of half lead and half tin, and are therefore unwholesome, though\r\nthe copper is completely covered. And those soups, which have any acid or\r\nwine boiled in them, unless they be made in silver, or in china, or in\r\nthose pot-vessels, which are not glazed by the addition of lead, are truly\r\npoisonous; as the acid, as lemon-juice or vinegar, when made hot, erodes or\r\ndissolves the lead and tin lining of the copper-vessels, and the leaden\r\nglaze of the porcelain ones. Hence, where silver cannot be had, iron\r\nvessels are preferable to tinned copper ones; or those made of tinned\r\niron-plates in the common tin-shops, which are said to be covered with pure\r\nor block tin.\r\n\r\n6. Another circumstance, which facilitates the nourishment of mankind, is\r\nthe mechanic art of grinding farinaceous seeds into powder between\r\nmill-stones; which may be called the artificial teeth of society. It is\r\nprobable, that some soft kinds of wood, especially when they have undergone\r\na kind of fermentation, and become of looser texture, might be thus used as\r\nfood in times of famine.\r\n\r\nNor is it improbable, that hay, which has been kept in stacks, so as to\r\nundergo the saccharine process, may be so managed by grinding and by\r\nfermentation with yeast like bread, as to serve in part for the sustenance\r\nof mankind in times of great scarcity. Dr. Priestley gave to a cow for some\r\ntime a strong infusion of hay in large quantity for her drink, and found\r\nthat she produced during this treatment above double the quantity of milk.\r\nHence if bread cannot be made from ground hay, there is great reason to\r\nsuspect, that a nutritive beverage may be thus prepared either in its\r\nsaccharine state, or fermented into a kind of beer.\r\n\r\nIn times of great scarcity there are other vegetables, which though not in\r\ncommon use, would most probably afford wholesome nourishment, either by\r\nboiling them, or drying and grinding them, or by both those processes in\r\nsuccession. Of these are perhaps the tops and the bark of all those\r\nvegetables, which are armed with thorns or prickles, as gooseberry trees,\r\nholly, gorse, and perhaps hawthorn. The inner bark of the elm tree makes a\r\nkind of gruel. And the roots of fern, and probably of very many other\r\nroots, as of grass and of clover taken up in winter, might yield\r\nnourishment either by boiling or baking, and separating the fibres from the\r\npulp by beating them; or by getting only the starch from those, which\r\npossess an acrid mucilage, as the white briony.\r\n\r\n7. However the arts of cookery and of grinding may increase or facilitate\r\nthe nourishment of mankind, the great source of it is from agriculture. In\r\nthe savage state, where men live solely by hunting, I was informed by Dr.\r\nFranklin, that there was seldom more than one family existed in a circle of\r\nfive miles diameter; which in a state of pasturage would support some\r\nhundred people, and in a state of agriculture many thousands. The art of\r\nfeeding mankind on so small a grain as wheat, which seems to have been\r\ndiscovered in Egypt by the immortal name of Ceres, shewed greater ingenuity\r\nthan feeding them with the large roots of potatoes, which seem to have been\r\na discovery of ill-fated Mexico.\r\n\r\nThis greater production of food by agriculture than by pasturage, shews\r\nthat a nation nourished by animal food will be less numerous than if\r\nnourished by vegetable; and the former will therefore be liable, if they\r\nare engaged in war, to be conquered by the latter, as Abel was slain by\r\nCain. This is perhaps the only valid argument against inclosing open arable\r\nfields. The great production of human nourishment by agriculture and\r\npasturage evinces the advantage of society over the savage state; as the\r\nnumber of mankind becomes increased a thousand fold by the arts of\r\nagriculture and pasturage; and their happiness is probably under good\r\ngovernments improved in as great a proportion, as they become liberated\r\nfrom the hourly fear of beasts of prey, from the daily fear of famine, and\r\nof the occasional incursions of their cannibal neighbours.\r\n\r\nBut pasturage cannot exist without property both in the soil, and the herds\r\nwhich it nurtures; and for the invention of arts, and production of tools\r\nnecessary to agriculture, some must think, and others labour; and as the\r\nefforts of some will be crowned with greater success than that of others,\r\nan inequality of the ranks of society must succeed; but this inequality of\r\nmankind in the present state of the world is too great for the purposes of\r\nproducing the greatest quantity of human nourishment, and the greatest sum\r\nof human happiness; there should be no slavery at one end of the chain of\r\nsociety, and no despotism at the other.--By the future improvements of\r\nhuman reason such governments may possibly hereafter be established, as may\r\na hundred-fold increase the numbers of mankind, and a thousand-fold their\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nIV. 1. Water must be considered as a part of our nutriment, because so much\r\nof it enters the composition of our solids as well as of our fluids; and\r\nbecause vegetables are now believed to draw almost the whole of their\r\nnourishment from this source. As in them the water is decomposed, as it is\r\nperspired by them in the sunshine, the oxygen gas increases the quantity\r\nand the purity of the atmosphere in their vicinity, and the hydrogen seems\r\nto be retained, and to form the nutritive juices, and consequent secretions\r\nof rosin, gum, wax, honey, oil, and other vegetable productions. See\r\nBotanic Garden, Part I. Cant. IV. line 25, note. It has however other uses\r\nin the system, besides that of a nourishing material, as it dilutes our\r\nfluids, and lubricates our solids; and on all these accounts a daily supply\r\nof it is required.\r\n\r\n2. River-water is in general purer than spring-water; as the neutral salts\r\nwashed down from the earth decompose each other, except perhaps the marine\r\nsalt; and the earths, with which spring-water frequently abounds, is\r\nprecipitated; yet it is not improbable, that the calcareous earth dissolved\r\nin the water of many springs may contribute to our nourishment, as the\r\nwater from springs, which contain earth, is said to conduce to enrich those\r\nlands, which are flooded with it, more than river water.\r\n\r\n3. Many arguments seem to shew, that calcareous earth contributes to the\r\nnourishment of animals and vegetables. First because calcareous earth\r\nconstitutes a considerable part of them, and must therefore either be\r\nreceived from without, or formed by them, or both, as milk, when taken as\r\nfood by a lactescent woman, is decomposed in the stomach by the process of\r\ndigestion, and again in part converted into milk by the pectoral glands.\r\nSecondly, because from the analogy of all organic life, whatever has\r\ncomposed a part of a vegetable or animal may again after its chemical\r\nsolution become a part of another vegetable or animal, such is the general\r\ntransmigration of matter. And thirdly, because the great use of lime in\r\nagriculture on almost all kinds of soil and situation cannot be\r\nsatisfactorily explained from its chemical properties alone. Though these\r\nmay also in certain soils and situations have considerable effect.\r\n\r\nThe chemical uses of lime in agriculture may be, 1. from its destroying in\r\na short time the cohesion of dead vegetable fibres, and thus reducing them\r\nto earth, which otherwise is effected by a slow process either by the\r\nconsumption of insects or by a gradual putrefaction. Thus I am informed\r\nthat a mixture of lime with oak bark, after the tanner has extracted from\r\nit whatever is soluble in water, will in two or three months reduce it to a\r\nfine black earth, which, if only laid in heaps, would require as many years\r\nto effect by its own spontaneous fermentation or putrefaction. This effect\r\nof lime must be particularly advantageous to newly inclosed commons when\r\nfirst broken up.\r\n\r\nSecondly, lime for many months continues to attract moisture from the air\r\nor earth, which it deprives I suppose of carbonic acid, and then suffers it\r\nto exhale again, as is seen on the plastered walls of new houses. On this\r\naccount it must be advantageous when mixed with dry or sandy soils, as it\r\nattracts moisture from the air above or the earth beneath, and this\r\nmoisture is then absorbed by the lymphatics of the roots of vegetables.\r\nThirdly, by mixing lime with clays it is believed to make them less\r\ncohesive, and thus to admit of their being more easily penetrated by\r\nvegetable fibres. A mixture of lime with clays destroys their\r\nsuperabundancy of acid, if such exists, and by uniting with it converts it\r\ninto gypsum or alabaster. And lastly, fresh lime destroys worms, snails,\r\nand other insects, with which it happens to come in contact.\r\n\r\nYet do not all these chemical properties seem to account for the great uses\r\nof lime in almost all soils and situations, as it contributes so much to\r\nthe melioration of the crops, as well as to their increase in quantity.\r\nWheat from land well limed is believed by farmers, millers, and bakers, to\r\nbe, as they suppose, thinner skinned; that is, it turns out more and better\r\nflour; which I suppose is owing to its containing more starch and less\r\nmucilage. In respect to grass-ground I am informed, that if a spadeful of\r\nlime be thrown on a tussock, which horses or cattle have refused to touch\r\nfor years, they will for many succeeding seasons eat it quite close to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nOne property of lime is not perhaps yet well understood, I mean its\r\nproducing so much heat, when it is mixed with water; which may be owing to\r\nthe elementary fluid of heat consolidated in the lime. It is the steam\r\noccasioned by this heat, when water is sprinkled upon lime, if the water be\r\nnot in too great quantity or too cold, which breaks the lime into such fine\r\npowder as almost to become fluid, which cannot be effected perhaps by any\r\nother means, and which I suppose must give great preference to lime in\r\nagriculture, and to the solutions of calcareous earth in water, over chalk\r\nor powdered limestone, when spread upon the land.\r\n\r\n4. It was formerly believed that waters replete with calcareous earth, such\r\nas incrust the inside of tea-kettles, or are laid to petrify moss, were\r\nliable to produce or to increase the stone in the bladder. This mistaken\r\nidea has lately been exploded by the improved chemistry, as no calcareous\r\nearth, or a very minute quantity, was found in the calculi analysed by\r\nScheel and Bergman. The waters of Matlock and of Carlsbad, both which cover\r\nthe moss, which they pass through, with a calcareous crust, are so far from\r\nincreasing the stone of the bladder or kidnies, that those of Carlsbad are\r\ncelebrated for giving relief to those labouring under these diseases.\r\nPhilos. Trans. Those of Matlock are drank in great quantities without any\r\nsuspicion of injury; and I well know a person who for above ten years has\r\ndrank about two pints a day of cold water from a spring, which very much\r\nincrusts the vessels, it is boiled in, with calcareous earth, and affords a\r\ncopious calcareous sediment with a solution of salt of tartar, and who\r\nenjoys a state of uninterrupted health.\r\n\r\nV. 1. As animal bodies consist much both of oxygen and azote, which make up\r\nthe composition of atmospheric air, these should be counted amongst\r\nnutritious substances. Besides that by the experiments of Dr. Priestley it\r\nappears, that the oxygen gains admittance into the blood through the moist\r\nmembranes of the lungs; and seems to be of much more immediate consequence\r\nto the preservation of our lives than the other kinds of nutriment above\r\nspecified.\r\n\r\nAs the basis of fixed air, or carbonic acid gas, is carbone, which also\r\nconstitutes a great part both of vegetable and animal bodies; this air\r\nshould likewise be reckoned amongst nutritive substances. Add to this, that\r\nwhen this carbonic acid air is swallowed, as it escapes from beer or cyder,\r\nor when water is charged with it as detruded from limestone by vitriolic\r\nacid, it affords an agreeable sensation both to the palate and stomach, and\r\nis therefore probably nutritive.\r\n\r\nThe immense quantity of carbone and of oxygen which constitute so great a\r\npart of the limestone countries is almost beyond conception, and, as it has\r\nbeen formed by animals, may again become a part of them, as well as the\r\ncalcareous matter with which they are united. Whence it may be conceived,\r\nthat the waters, which abound with limestone in solution, may supply\r\nnutriment both to animals and to vegetables, as mentioned above.\r\n\r\nVI. 1. The manner, in which nutritious particles are substituted in the\r\nplace of those, which are mechanically abraded, or chemically decomposed,\r\nor which vanish by animal absorption, must be owing to animal appetency, as\r\ndescribed in Sect. XXXVII. 3. and is probably similar to the process of\r\ninflammation, which produces new vessels and new fluids; or to that which\r\nconstitutes the growth of the body to maturity. Thus the granulations of\r\nnew flesh to repair the injuries of wounds are visible to the eye; as well\r\nas the callous matter, which cements broken bones; the calcareous matter,\r\nwhich repairs injured snail-shells; and the threads, which are formed by\r\nsilk-worms and spiders; which are all secreted in a softer state, and\r\nharden by exsiccation, or by the contact of the air, or by absorption of\r\ntheir more fluid parts.\r\n\r\nWhether the materials, which thus supply the waste of the system, can be\r\ngiven any other way than by the stomach, so as to preserve the body for a\r\nlength of time, is worth our inquiry; as cases sometimes occur, in which\r\nfood cannot be introduced into the stomach, as in obstructions of the\r\noesophagus, inflammations of the throat, or in hydrophobia; and other cases\r\nare not unfrequent in which the power of digestion is nearly or totally\r\ndestroyed, as in anorexia epileptica, and in many fevers.\r\n\r\nIn the former of these circumstances liquid nutriment may sometimes be got\r\ninto the stomach through a flexible catheter; as described in Class III. 1.\r\n1. 15. In the latter many kinds of mild aliment, as milk or broth, have\r\nfrequently been injected as clysters, together with a small quantity of\r\nopium, as ten drops of the tincture, three or four times a day; to which\r\nalso might be added very small quantities of vinous spirit. But these, as\r\nfar as I have observed, will not long sustain a person, who cannot take any\r\nsustenance by the stomach.\r\n\r\n2. Another mode of applying nutritive fluids might be by extensive\r\nfomentations, or by immerging the whole body in a bath of broth, or of warm\r\nmilk, which might at the same time be coagulated by rennet, or the acid of\r\nthe calf's stomach; broth or whey might thus probably be introduced, in\r\npart at least, into the circulation, as a solution of nitre is said to have\r\nbeen absorbed in a pediluvium, which was afterwards discovered by the\r\nmanner in which paper dipped frequently in the urine of the patient and\r\ndried, burnt and sparkled like touch-paper. Great quantity of water is also\r\nknown to be absorbed by those, who have bathed in the warm bath after\r\nexercise and abstinence from liquids. Cleopatra was said to travel with\r\n4000 milch-asses in her train, and to bathe every morning in their milk,\r\nwhich she probably might use as a cosmetic rather than a nutritive.\r\n\r\n3. The transfusion of blood from another animal into the vein of one, who\r\ncould take no sustenance by the throat, or digest none by the stomach,\r\nmight long continue to support him; and perhaps other nutriment, as milk or\r\nmucilage, might be this way introduced into the system, but we have not yet\r\nsufficient experiments on this subject. See Sect. XXXII. 4. and Class I. 2.\r\n3. 25. and Sup. I. 14. 2.\r\n\r\nVII. Various kinds of condiments, or sauces, have been taken along with\r\nvegetable or animal food, and have been thought by some to strengthen the\r\nprocess of digestion and consequent process of nutrition. Of these wine, or\r\nother fermented liquors, vinegar, salt, spices, and mustard, have been in\r\nmost common use, and I believe to the injury of thousands. As the stomach\r\nby their violent stimulus at length loses its natural degree of\r\nirritability, and indigestion is the consequence; which is attended with\r\nflatulency and emaciation. Where any of these have been taken so long as to\r\ninduce a habit, they must either be continued, but not increased; or the\r\nuse of them should be gradually and cautiously diminished or discontinued,\r\nas directed in Sect.

II.\r\n\r\nINCITANTIA.\r\n\r\nI. 1. Those things, which increase the exertions of all the irritative\r\nmotions, are termed incitantia. As alcohol, or the spirituous part of\r\nfermented liquors, opium, and many drugs, which are still esteemed poisons,\r\ntheir proper doses not being ascertained. To these should be added the\r\nexhilarating passions of the mind, as joy, love: and externally the\r\napplication of heat, electricity, æther, essential oils, friction, and\r\nexercise.\r\n\r\n2. These promote both the secretions and absorptions, increase the natural\r\nheat, and remove those pains, which originate from the defect of irritative\r\nmotions, termed nervous pains; and prevent the convulsions consequent to\r\nthem. When given internally they induce costiveness, and deep coloured\r\nurine; and by a greater dose intoxication, and its consequences.\r\n\r\nII. OBSERVATIONS ON THE INCITANTIA.\r\n\r\nI. 1. Opium and alcohol increase all the secretions and absorptions. The\r\nincrease of the secretion of sensorial power appears from the violent\r\nexertions of drunken people; the secretion of sweat is more certainly\r\nexcited by opium or wine than by any other medicine; and the increase of\r\ngeneral heat, which these drugs produce, is an evidence of their effect in\r\npromoting all the secretions; since an increase of secretion is always\r\nattended with increase of heat in the part, as in hepatic and other\r\ninflammations.\r\n\r\n2. But as they at the same time promote absorption; those fluids, which are\r\nsecreted into receptacles, as the urine, bile, intestinal and pulmonary\r\nmucus, have again their thinner parts absorbed; and hence, though the\r\nquantity of secreted fluid was increased, yet as the absorption was also\r\nincreased, the excretion from these receptacles is lessened; at the same\r\ntime that it is deeper coloured or of thicker consistence, as the urine,\r\nalvine feces, and pulmonary mucus. Whereas the perspiration being secreted\r\non the surface of the body is visible in its increased quantity, before it\r\ncan be reabsorbed; whence arises that erroneous opinion, that opium\r\nincreases the cutaneous secretion, and lessens all the others.\r\n\r\n3. It must however be noted, that after evacuations opium seems to promote\r\nthe absorptions more than the secretions; if you except that of the\r\nsensorial power in the brain, which probably suffers no absorption. Hence\r\nits efficacy in restraining hæmorrhages, after the vessels are emptied, by\r\npromoting venous absorption.\r\n\r\n4. In ulcers the matter is thickened by the exhibition of opium from the\r\nincreased absorption of the thinner parts of it; but it is probable, that\r\nthe whole secretion, including the part which is absorbed, is increased;\r\nand hence new fibres are secreted along with the matter, and the ulcer\r\nfills with new granulations of flesh. But as no ulcer can heal, till it\r\nceases to discharge; that is, till the absorption becomes as great as the\r\nexcretion; those medicines, which promote absorption only, are more\r\nadvantageous for the healing an ulcer after it is filled with new flesh; as\r\nthe Peruvian bark internally; with bandages and solutions of lead\r\nexternally.\r\n\r\n5. There are many pains which originate from a want of due motion in the\r\npart, as those occasioned by cold; and all those pains which are attended\r\nwith cold extremities, and are generally termed nervous. These are relieved\r\nby whatever excites the part into its proper actions, and hence by opium\r\nand alcohol; which are the most universal stimulants we are acquainted\r\nwith. In these cases the effect of opium is produced, as soon as the body\r\nbecomes generally warm; and a degree of intoxication or sleep follows the\r\ncessation of the pain.\r\n\r\nThese nervous pains (as they are called) frequently return at certain\r\nperiods of time, and are also frequently succeeded by convulsions; in these\r\ncases if opium removes the pain, the convulsions do not come on. For this\r\npurpose it is best to exhibit it gradually, as a grain every hour, or half\r\nhour, till it intoxicates. Here it must be noted, that a much less quantity\r\nwill prevent the periods of these cold pains, than is necessary to relieve\r\nthem after their access. As a grain and half of opium given an hour before\r\nthe expected paroxysm will prevent the cold fit of an intermittent fever,\r\nbut will not soon remove it, when it is already formed. For in the former\r\ncase the usual or healthy associations or catenations of motion favour the\r\neffect of the medicine; in the latter case these associations or\r\ncatenations are disordered, or interrupted, and new ones are formed, which\r\nso far counteract the effect of the medicine.\r\n\r\nWhen opium has been required in large doses to ease or prevent convulsions,\r\nsome have advised the patient to omit the use of wine, as a greater\r\nquantity of opium might then be exhibited; and as opium seems to increase\r\nabsorption more, and secretion less, than vinous spirit; it may in some\r\ncases be useful to exchange one for the other; as in diseases attended with\r\ntoo great evacuation, as diarrhoea, and dysentery, opium may be preferable;\r\non the contrary in tetanus, or locked-jaw, where inflammation of the system\r\nmight be of service, wine may be preferable to opium; see Class III. 1. 1.\r\n13. I have generally observed, that a mixture of spirit of wine and warm\r\nwater, given alternately with the doses of opium, has soonest and most\r\ncertainly produced that degree of intoxication, which was necessary to\r\nrelieve the patient in the epilepsia dolorifica.\r\n\r\n6. There is likewise some relief given by opium to inflammatory pains, or\r\nthose from excess of motion in the affected part; but with this difference,\r\nthat this relief from the pains, and the sleep, which it occasions, does\r\nnot occur till some hours after the exhibition of the opium. This requires\r\nto be explained; after the stimulus of opium or of alcohol ceases, as after\r\ncommon drunkenness, a consequent torpor comes on; and the whole habit\r\nbecomes less irritable by the natural stimuli. Hence the head-achs,\r\nsickness, and languor, on the next day after intoxication, with cold skin,\r\nand general debility. Now in pains from excess of motion, called\r\ninflammatory pains, when opium is given, the pain is not relieved, till the\r\ndebility comes on after the stimulus ceases to act; for then after the\r\ngreater stimulus of the opium has exhausted much of the sensorial power;\r\nthe less stimulus, which before caused the pain, does not now excite the\r\npart into unnatural action.\r\n\r\nIn these cases the stimulus of the opium first increases the pain; and it\r\nsometimes happens, that so great a torpor follows, as to produce the death\r\nor mortification of the affected part; whence the danger of giving opium in\r\ninflammatory diseases, especially in inflammation of the bowels; but in\r\ngeneral the pain returns with its former violence, when the torpor above\r\nmentioned ceases. Hence these pains attended with inflammation are best\r\nrelieved by copious venesection, other evacuations, and the class of\r\nmedicines called torpentia.\r\n\r\n7. These pains from excess of motion are attended with increased heat of\r\nthe whole, or of the affected part, and a strong quick pulse; the pains\r\nfrom defect of motion are attended with cold extremities, and a weak pulse;\r\nwhich is also generally more frequent than natural, but not always so.\r\n\r\n8. Opium and alcohol are the only two drugs, we are much acquainted with,\r\nwhich intoxicate; and by this circumstance are easily distinguished from\r\nthe secernentia and sorbentia. Camphor, and cicuta, and nicotiana, are\r\nthought to induce a kind of intoxication; and there are many other drugs of\r\nthis class, whose effects are less known, or their doses not ascertained;\r\nas atropa belladonna, hyocyamus, stramonium, prunus laurocerasus,\r\nmenispermum, cynoglossum, some fungi, and the water distilled from black\r\ncherry-stones; the last of which was once much in use for the convulsions\r\nof children, and was said to have good effect; but is now improvidently\r\nleft out of our pharmacopias. I have known one leaf of the laurocerasus,\r\nshred and made into tea, given every morning for a week with no ill\r\nconsequence to a weak hysteric lady, but rather perhaps with advantage.\r\n\r\n9. The pernicious effects of a continued use of much vinous spirit is daily\r\nseen and lamented by physicians; not only early debility, like premature\r\nage, but a dreadful catalogue of diseases is induced by this kind of\r\nintemperance; as dropsy, gout, leprosy, epilepsy, insanity, as described in\r\nBotanic Garden, Part II. Canto III. line 357. The stronger or less diluted\r\nthe spirit is taken, the sooner it seems to destroy, as in dram-drinkers;\r\nbut still sooner, when kernels of apricots, or bitter almonds, or\r\nlaurel-leaf, are infused in the spirit, which is termed ratafia; as then\r\ntwo poisons are swallowed at the same time. And vinegar, as it contains\r\nmuch vinous spirit, is probably a noxious part of our diet. And the\r\ndistilled vinegar, which is commonly sold in the shops, is truly poisonous,\r\nas it is generally distilled by means of a pewter or leaden alembic-head or\r\nworm-tube, and abounds with lead; which any one may detect by mixing with\r\nit a solution of liver of sulphur. Opium, when taken as a luxury, not as a\r\nmedicine, is as pernicious as alcohol; as Baron de Tott relates in his\r\naccount of the opium-eaters in Turkey.\r\n\r\n10. It must be observed, that a frequent repetition of the use of this\r\nclass of medicines so habituates the body to their stimulus, that their\r\ndose may gradually be increased to an astonishing quantity, such as\r\notherwise would instantly destroy life; as is frequently seen in those, who\r\naccustom themselves to the daily use of alcohol and opium; and it would\r\nseem, that these unfortunate people become diseased as soon as they omit\r\ntheir usual potations; and that the consequent gout, dropsy, palsy, or\r\npimpled face, occur from the debility occasioned from the want of\r\naccustomed stimulus, or to some change in the contractile fibres, which\r\nrequires the continuance or increase of it. Whence the cautions necessary\r\nto be observed are mentioned in Sect. XII. 7. 8.\r\n\r\n11. It is probable, that some of the articles in the subsequent catalogue\r\ndo not induce intoxication, though they have been esteemed to do so; as\r\ntobacco, hemlock, nux vomica, stavisagria; and on this account should\r\nrather belong to other arrangements, as to the secernentia, or sorbentia,\r\nor invertentia.\r\n\r\nII. 1. Externally the application of heat, as the warm bath, by its\r\nstimulus on the skin excites the excretory ducts of the perspirative\r\nglands, and the mouths of the lymphatics, which open on its surface, into\r\ngreater action; and in consequence many other irritative motions, which are\r\nassociated with them. To this increased action is added pleasurable\r\nsensation, which adds further activity to the system; and thus many kinds\r\nof pain receive relief from this additional atmosphere of heat.\r\n\r\nThe use of a warm bath of about 96 or 98 degrees of heat, for half an hour\r\nonce a day for three or four months, I have known of great service to weak\r\npeople, and is perhaps the least noxious of all unnatural stimuli; which\r\nhowever, like all other great excitement, may be carried to excess, as\r\ncomplained of by the ancients. The unmeaning application of the words\r\nrelaxation and bracing to warm and cold baths has much prevented the use of\r\nthis grateful stimulus; and the misuse of the term warm-bath, when applied\r\nto baths colder than the body, as to those of Buxton and Matlock, and to\r\nartificial baths of less than 90 degrees of heat, which ought to be termed\r\ncold ones, has contributed to mislead the unwary in their application.\r\n\r\nThe stimulus of wine, or spice, or salt, increases the heat of the system\r\nby increasing all or some of the secretions; and hence the strength is\r\ndiminished afterwards by the loss of fluids, as well as by the increased\r\naction of the fibres. But the stimulus of the warm-bath supplies heat\r\nrather than produces it; and rather fills the system by increased\r\nabsorption, than empties it by increased secretion; and may hence be\r\nemployed with advantage in almost all cases of debility with cold\r\nextremities, perhaps even in anasarca, and at the approach of death in\r\nfevers. In these cases a bath much beneath 98 degrees, as of 80 or 85,\r\nmight do injury, as being a cold-bath compared with the heat of the body,\r\nthough such a bath is generally called a warm one.\r\n\r\nThe activity of the system thus produced by a bath of 98 degrees of heat,\r\nor upwards, does not seem to render the patients liable to take cold, when\r\nthey come out of it; for the system is less inclined to become torpid than\r\nbefore, as the warmth thus acquired by communication, rather than by\r\nincreased action, continues long without any consequent chillness. Which\r\naccords with the observation of Dr. Fordyce, mentioned in Sup. I. 5. 1. who\r\nsays, that those who are confined some time in an atmosphere of 120 or 130\r\ndegrees of heat, do not feel cold or look pale on coming into a temperature\r\nof 30 or 40 degrees; which would produce great paleness and sensation of\r\ncoldness in those, who had been some time confined in an atmosphere of only\r\n86 or 90 degrees of heat. Treatise on Simple Fever, p. 168.\r\n\r\nHence heat, where it can be confined on a torpid part along with moisture,\r\nas on a scrophulous tumour, will contribute to produce suppuration or\r\nresolution. This is done by applying a warm poultice, which should be\r\nfrequently repeated; or a plaster of resin, wax, or fat; or by covering the\r\npart with oiled silk; both which last prevent the perspirable matter from\r\nescaping as well as the heat of the part, as these substances repel\r\nmoisture, and are bad conductors of heat. Another great use of the stimulus\r\nof heat is by applying it to torpid ulcers, which are generally termed\r\nscrophulous or scorbutic, and are much easier inclined to heal, when\r\ncovered with several folds of flannel.\r\n\r\nMr. ---- had for many months been afflicted with an ulcer in perinæo, which\r\ncommunicated with the urethra, through which a part of his urine was daily\r\nevacuated with considerable pain; and was reduced to a great degree of\r\ndebility. He used a hot-bath of 96 or 98 degrees of heat every day for half\r\nan hour during about six months. By this agreeable stimulus repeated thus\r\nat uniform times not only the ulcer healed, contrary to the expectation of\r\nhis friends, but he acquired greater health and strength, than he had for\r\nsome years previously experienced.\r\n\r\nMrs. ---- was affected with transient pains, which were called nervous\r\nspasms, and with great fear of diseases, which she did not labour under,\r\nwith cold extremities, and general debility. She used a hot-bath every\r\nother day of 96 degrees of heat for about four months, and recovered a good\r\nstate of health, with greater strength and courage, than she had possessed\r\nfor many months before.\r\n\r\nMr. Z. a gentleman about 65 years of age, who had lived rather\r\nintemperately in respect to vinous potation, and had for many years had\r\nannual visits of the gout, which now became irregular, and he appeared to\r\nbe losing his strength, and beginning to feel the effects of age. He used a\r\nbath, as hot as was agreeable to his sensations, twice a week for about a\r\nyear and half, and greatly recovered his health and strength with less\r\nfrequent and less violent returns of regular gout, and is now near 80 years\r\nof age.\r\n\r\nWhen Dr. Franklin, the American philosopher, was in England many years ago,\r\nI recommended to him the use of a warm-bath twice a week to prevent the too\r\nspeedy access of old age, which he then thought that he felt the approach\r\nof, and I have been informed, that he continued the use of it till near his\r\ndeath, which was at an advanced age.\r\n\r\nAll these patients were advised not to keep themselves warmer than their\r\nusual habits, after they came out of the bath, whether they went into bed\r\nor not; as the design was not to promote perspiration, which weakens all\r\nconstitutions, and seldom is of service to any. Thus a flannel shirt,\r\nparticularly if it be worn in warm weather, occasions weakness by\r\nstimulating the skin by its points into too great action, and producing\r\nheat in consequence; and occasions emaciation by increasing the discharge\r\nof perspirable matter; and in both these respects differs from the effect\r\nof warm bathing, which communicates heat to the system at the same time\r\nthat it stimulates it, and causes absorption more than exhalation.\r\n\r\n2. The effect of the passage of an electric shock through a paralytic limb\r\nin causing it to contract, besides the late experiments of Galvani and\r\nVolta on frogs, intitle it to be classed amongst universal stimulants.\r\nElectric shocks frequently repeated daily for a week or two remove\r\nchronical pains, as the pleurodyne chronica, Class I. 2. 4. 14. and other\r\nchronic pains, which are termed rheumatic, probably by promoting the\r\nabsorption of some extravasated material. Scrophulous tumours are sometimes\r\nabsorbed, and sometimes brought to suppurate by passing electric shocks\r\nthrough them daily for two or three weeks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nMiss ----, a young lady about eight years of age, had a swelling about the\r\nsize of a pigeon's egg on her neck a little below her ear, which long\r\ncontinued in an indolent state. Thirty or forty small electric shocks were\r\npassed through it once or twice a day for two or three weeks, and it then\r\nsuppurated and healed without difficulty. For this operation the coated jar\r\nof the electric machine had on its top an electrometer, which measured the\r\nshocks by the approach of a brass knob, which communicated with the\r\nexternal coating to another, which communicated with the internal one, and\r\ntheir distance was adjusted by a screw. So that the shocks were so small as\r\nnot to alarm the child, and the accumulated electricity was frequently\r\ndischarged, as the wheel continued turning. The tumour was inclosed between\r\ntwo other brass knobs, which were fixed on wires, which passed through\r\nglass tubes, the tubes were cemented in two grooves on a board, so that at\r\none end they were nearer each other than at the other, and the knobs were\r\npushed out so far as exactly to include the tumour, as described in the\r\nannexed plate, which is about half the size of the original apparatus.\r\n\r\nInflammations of the eyes without fever are frequently cured by taking a\r\nstream of very small electric sparks from them, or giving the electric\r\nsparks to them, once or twice a day for a week or two; that is, the new\r\nvessels, which constitute inflammation in these inirritable constitutions,\r\nare absorbed by the activity of the absorbents induced by the stimulus of\r\nthe electric aura. For this operation the easiest method is to fix a\r\npointed wire to a stick of sealing wax, or to an insulating handle of\r\nglass, one end of this wire communicates with the prime conductor, and the\r\npoint is approached near the inflamed eye in every direction.\r\n\r\nIII. Externally the application of ether, and of essential oils, as of\r\ncloves or cinnamon, seem to possess a general stimulating effect. As they\r\ninstantly relieve tooth-ach, and hiccough, when these pains are not in\r\nviolent degree; and camphor in large doses is said to produce intoxication;\r\nthis effect however I have not been witness to, and have reason to doubt.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which ether and the essential oil operate on the system when\r\napplied externally, is a curious question, as pain is so immediately\r\nrelieved by them, that they must seem to penetrate by the great fluidity or\r\nexpansive property of a part of them, as of their odoriferous exhalation or\r\nvapour, and that they thus stimulate the torpid part, and not by their\r\nbeing taken up by the absorbent vessels, and carried thither by the long\r\ncourse of circulation; nor is it probable, that these pains are relieved by\r\nthe sympathy of the torpid membrane with the external skin, which is thus\r\nstimulated into action; as it does not succeed, unless it is applied over\r\nthe pained part. Thus there appears to be three different modes by which\r\nextraneous bodies may be introduced into the system, besides that of\r\nabsorption. 1st. By ethereal transition, as heat and electricity; 2d. by\r\nchemical attraction, as oxygen; and 3d. by expansive vapour, as ether and\r\nessential oils.\r\n\r\nIV. The perpetual necessity of the mixture of oxygen gas with the blood in\r\nthe lungs evinces, that it must act as a stimulus to the sanguiferous\r\nsystem, as the motions of the heart and arteries presently cease, when\r\nanimals are immersed in airs which possess no oxygen. It may also\r\nsubsequently answer another important purpose, as it probably affords the\r\nmaterial for the production of the sensorial power; which is supposed to be\r\nsecreted in the brain or medullary part of the nerves; and that the\r\nperpetual demand of this fluid in respiration is occasioned by the\r\nsensorial power, which is supposed to be produced from it, being too subtle\r\nto be long confined in any part of the system.\r\n\r\nAnother proof of the stimulant quality of oxygen appears from the increased\r\nacrimony, which the matter of a common abscess possesses, after it has been\r\nexposed to the air of the atmosphere, but not before; and probably all\r\nother contagious matters owe their fever-producing property to having been\r\nconverted into acids by their union with oxygen.\r\n\r\nAs oxygen penetrates the fine moist membranes of the air-vessels of the\r\nlungs, and unites with the blood by a chemical attraction, as is seen to\r\nhappen, when blood is drawn into a bason, the lower surface of the\r\ncrassamentum is of a very dark red so long as it is covered from the air by\r\nthe upper surface, but becomes florid in a short time on its being exposed\r\nto the atmosphere; the manner of its introduction into the system is not\r\nprobably by animal absorption but by chemical attraction, in which\r\ncircumstance it differs from the fluids before mentioned both of heat and\r\nelectricity, and of ether and essential oils.\r\n\r\nAs oxygen has the property of passing through moist animal membranes, as\r\nfirst discovered by the great Dr. Priestley, it is probable it might be of\r\nuse in vibices, and petechiæ in fevers, and in other bruises; if the skin\r\nover those parts was kept moist by warm water, and covered with oxygen gas\r\nby means of an inverted glass, or even by exposing the parts thus moistened\r\nto the atmosphere, as the dark coloured extravasated blood might thus\r\nbecome florid, and by its increase of stimulus facilitate its reabsorption.\r\n\r\nTwo weak patients, to whom I gave oxygen gas in as pure a state as it can\r\neasily be procured from Exeter manganese, and in the quantity of about four\r\ngallons a day, seemed to feel refreshed, and stronger, and to look better\r\nimmediately after respiring it, and gained strength in a short time. Two\r\nothers, one of whom laboured under confirmed hydrothorax, and the other\r\nunder a permanent and uniform difficulty of respiration, were not\r\nrefreshed, or in any way served by the use of oxygen in the above quantity\r\nof four gallons a day for a fortnight, which I ascribed to the\r\ninirritability of the diseased lungs. For other cases the reader is\r\nreferred to the publications of Dr. Beddoes; Confederations on the Use of\r\nFactitious Airs, sold by Johnson, London.\r\n\r\nIts effects would probably have been greater in respect to the quantity\r\nbreathed, if it had been given in a dilute state, mixed with 10 or 20 times\r\nits quantity of atmospheric air, as otherwise much of it returns by\r\nexpiration without being deprived of its quality, as may be seen by the\r\nperson breathing on the flame of a candle, which it enlarges. See the\r\nTreatise of Dr. Beddoes above mentioned.\r\n\r\nV. Those passions, which are attended with pleasurable sensation, excite\r\nthe system into increased action in consequence of that sensation, as joy,\r\nand love, as is seen by the flush of the skin. Those passions, which are\r\nattended with disagreeable sensation, produce torpor in general by the\r\nexpence of sensorial power occasioned by inactive pain; unless volition be\r\nexcited in consequence of the painful sensation; and in that case an\r\nincreased activity of the system occurs; thus paleness and coldness are the\r\nconsequence of fear, but warmth and redness are the consequence of anger.\r\n\r\nVI. Besides the exertions of the system occasioned by increased stimuli,\r\nand consequent irritation, and by the passions of the mind above described,\r\nthe increased actions occasioned by exercise belong to this article. These\r\nmay be divided into the actions of the body in consequence of volition,\r\nwhich is generally termed labour; or secondly, in consequence of agreeable\r\nsensation, which is termed play or sport; thirdly, the exercise occasioned\r\nby agitation, as in a carriage or on horseback; fourthly, that of friction,\r\nas with a brush or hand, so much used in the baths of Turkey; and lastly,\r\nthe exercise of swinging.\r\n\r\nThe first of these modes of exercise is frequently carried to great excess\r\neven amongst our own labourers, and more so under the lash of slavery; so\r\nthat the body becomes emaciated and sinks under either the present\r\nhardships, or by a premature old age. The second mode of exercise is seen\r\nin the play of all young animals, as kittens, and puppies, and children;\r\nand is so necessary to their health as well as to their pleasure, that\r\nthose children, which are too much confined from it, not only become\r\npale-faced and bloated, with tumid bellies, and consequent worms, but are\r\nliable to get habits of unnatural actions, as twitching of their limbs, or\r\nof some parts of their countenance; together with an ill-humoured or\r\ndiscontented mind.\r\n\r\nAgitation in a carriage or on horseback, as it requires some little\r\nvoluntary exertion to preserve the body perpendicular, but much less\r\nvoluntary exertion than in walking, seems the best adapted to invalids; who\r\nby these means obtain exercise principally by the strength of the horse,\r\nand do not therefore too much exhaust their own sensorial power. The use of\r\nfriction with a brush or hand, for half an hour or longer morning and\r\nevening, is still better adapted to those, who are reduced to extreme\r\ndebility; and none of their own sensorial power is thus expended, and\r\naffords somewhat like the warm-bath activity without self-exertion, and is\r\nused as a luxury after warm bathing in many parts of Asia.\r\n\r\nAnother kind of exercise is that of swinging, which requires some exertion\r\nto keep the body perpendicular, or pointing towards the center of the\r\nswing, but is at the same time attended with a degree of vertigo; and is\r\ndescribed in Class II. 1. 6. 7. IV. 2. 1. 10. Sup. I. 3. and 15.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of much exercise has perhaps been more insisted upon by\r\nphysicians, than nature seems to demand. Few animals exercise themselves so\r\nas to induce visible sweat, unless urged to it by mankind, or by fear, or\r\nhunger. And numbers of people in our market towns, of ladies particularly,\r\nwith small fortunes, live to old age in health, without any kind of\r\nexercise of body, or much activity of mind.\r\n\r\nIn summer weak people cannot continue too long in the air, if it can be\r\ndone without fatigue; and in winter they should go out several times in a\r\nday for a few minutes, using the cold air like a cold-bath, to invigorate\r\nand render them more hardy.\r\n\r\nIII.

Those things which increase the irritative motions, which constitute\r\nsecretion, are termed secernentia; which are as various as the glands,\r\nwhich they stimulate into action.\r\n\r\n1. Diaphoretics, as aromatic vegetables, essential oils, ether, volatile\r\nalcali, neutral salts, antimonial preparations, external heat, exercise,\r\nfriction, cold water for a time with subsequent warmth, blisters, electric\r\nfluid.\r\n\r\n2. Sialagogues, as mercury internally, and pyrethrum externally.\r\n\r\n3. Expectorants, as squill, onions, gum ammoniac, seneka root, mucilage:\r\nsome of these increase the pulmonary perspiration, and perhaps the\r\npulmonary mucus.\r\n\r\n4. Diuretics, as neutral salts, fixed alcali, balsams, resins, asparagus,\r\ncantharides.\r\n\r\n5. Cathartics of the mild kind, as sena, jalap, neutral salts, manna. They\r\nincrease the secretions of bile, pancreatic juice, and intestinal mucus.\r\n\r\n6. The mucus of the bladder is increased by cantharides, and perhaps by oil\r\nof turpentine.\r\n\r\n7. The mucus of the rectum by aloe internally, by clysters and\r\nsuppositories externally.\r\n\r\n8. The mucus of the cellular membrane is increased by blisters and\r\nsinapisms.\r\n\r\n9. The mucus of the nostrils is increased by errhines of the milder kind,\r\nas marum, common snuff.\r\n\r\n10. The secretion of tears is increased by volatile salts, the vapour of\r\nonions, by grief, and joy.\r\n\r\n11. All those medicines increase the heat of the body, and remove those\r\npains, which originate from a defect of motion in the vessels, which\r\nperform secretion; as pepper produces a glow on the skin, and balsam of\r\nPeru is said to relieve the flatulent cholic. But these medicines differ\r\nfrom the preceding class, as they neither induce costiveness nor deep\r\ncoloured urine in their usual dose, nor intoxication in any dose.\r\n\r\n12. Yet if any of these are used unnecessarily, it is obvious, like the\r\nincitantia, that they must contribute to shorten our lives by sooner\r\nrendering peculiar parts of the system disobedient to their natural\r\nstimuli. Of those in daily use the great excess of common salt is probably\r\nthe most pernicious, as it enters all our cookery, and is probably one\r\ncause of scrophula, and of sea-scurvy, when joined with other causes of\r\ndebility. See Botanic Garden, Part II. Canto IV. line 221. Spices taken to\r\nexcess by stimulating the stomach, and the vessels of the skin by\r\nassociation, into unnecessary action, contribute to weaken these parts of\r\nthe system, but are probably less noxious than the general use of so much\r\nsalt.\r\n\r\nII. OBSERVATIONS ON THE SECERNENTIA.\r\n\r\nI. 1. Some of the medicines of this class produce absorption in some\r\ndegree, though their principal effect is exerted on the secerning part of\r\nour system. We shall have occasion to observe a similar circumstance in the\r\nnext class of medicines termed Sorbentia; as of these some exert their\r\neffects in a smaller degree on the secerning system. Nor will this surprise\r\nany one, who has observed, that all natural objects are presented to us in\r\na state of combination; and that hence the materials, which produce these\r\ndifferent effects, are frequently found mingled in the same vegetable. Thus\r\nthe pure aromatics increase the action of the vessels, which secrete the\r\nperspirable matter; and the pure astringents increase the action of the\r\nvessels, which absorb the mucus from the lungs, and other cavities of the\r\nbody; hence it must happen, that nutmeg, which possesses both these\r\nqualities, should have the double effect above mentioned.\r\n\r\nOther drugs have this double effect, and belong either to the class of\r\nSecernentia or Sorbentia, according to the dose in which they are\r\nexhibited. Thus a small dose of alum increases absorption, and induces\r\ncostiveness; and a large one increases the secretions into the intestinal\r\ncanal, and becomes cathartic. And this accounts for the constipation of the\r\nbelly left after the purgative quality of rhubarb ceases, for it increases\r\nabsorption in a smaller dose, and secretion in a greater. Hence when a part\r\nof the larger dose is carried out of the habit by stools, the small\r\nquantity which remains induces costiveness. Hence rhubarb exhibited in\r\nsmall doses, as 2 or 3 grains twice a day, strengthens the system by\r\nincreasing the action of the absorbent vessels, and of the intestinal\r\ncanal.\r\n\r\n2. Diaphoretics. The perspiration is a secretion from the blood in its\r\npassage through the capillary vessels, as other secretions are produced in\r\nthe termination of the arteries in the various glands. After this secretion\r\nthe blood loses its florid colour, which it regains in its passage through\r\nthe lungs; which evinces that something besides water is secreted on the\r\nskins of animals.\r\n\r\nNo statical experiments can ascertain the quantity of our perspiration; as\r\na continued absorption of the moisture of the atmosphere exists at the same\r\ntime both by the cutaneous and pulmonary lymphatics.\r\n\r\n3. Every gland is capable of being excited into greater exertions by an\r\nappropriated stimulus applied either by its mixture with the blood\r\nimmediately to the secerning vessel, or applied externally to its excretory\r\nduct. Thus mercury internally promotes an increased salivation, and\r\npyrethrum externally applied to the excretory ducts of the salival glands.\r\nAloes stimulate the rectum internally mixed with the circulating blood; and\r\nsea-salt by injection externally. Now as the capillaries, which secrete the\r\nperspirable matter, lie near the surface of the body, the application of\r\nexternal heat acts immediately on their excretory ducts, and promotes\r\nperspiration; internally those drugs which possess a fragrant essential\r\noil, or spiritus rector, produce this effect, as the aromatic vegetables,\r\nof which the number is very great.\r\n\r\n4. It must be remembered, that a due quantity of some aqueous vehicle must\r\nbe given to support this evacuation; otherwise a burning heat without much\r\nvisible sweat must be the consequence. When the skin acquires a degree of\r\nheat much above 108, as appears by Dr. Alexander's experiments, no visible\r\nsweat is produced; which is owing to the great heat of the skin evaporating\r\nit as hastily, as it is secreted; and, where the sweat is secreted in\r\nabundance, its evaporation cannot carry off the exuberant heat, like the\r\nvapour of boiling water; because a great part of it is wiped off, or\r\nabsorbed by the bed-clothes; or the air about the patient is not changed\r\nsufficiently often, as it becomes saturated with the perspirable matter.\r\nAnd hence it is probable, that the waste of perspirable matter is as great,\r\nor greater, when the skin is hot and dry, as when it stands in drops on the\r\nskin; as appears from the inextinguishable thirst.\r\n\r\nHence Dr. Alexander found, that when the heat of the body was greater than\r\n108, nothing produced sweats but repeated draughts of cold water; and of\r\nwarm fluids, when the heat was much below that degree. And that cold water\r\nwhich procured sweats instantaneously when the heat was above 108, stopped\r\nthem as certainly when it was below that heat; and that flannels, wrung out\r\nof warm water and wrapped round the legs and thighs, were then most\r\ncertainly productive of sweats.\r\n\r\n5. The diaphoretics are all said to succeed much better, if given early in\r\nthe morning, about an hour before sun-rise, than at any other time; which\r\nis owing to the great excitability of every part of the system after the\r\nsensorial power has been accumulated during sleep. In those, who have\r\nhectic fever, or the febricula, or nocturnal fever of debility, the morning\r\nsweats are owing to the decline of the fever-fit, as explained in Sect.\r\nXXXII. 9. In some of these patients the sweat does not occur till they\r\nawake; because then the system is still more excitable than during sleep,\r\nbecause the assistance of the voluntary power in respiration facilitates\r\nthe general circulation. See Class I. 2. 1. 3.\r\n\r\n6. It must be observed, that the skin is very dry and hard to the touch,\r\nwhere the absorbents, which open on its surface, do not act; as in some\r\ndropsies, and other diseases attended with great thirst. This dryness, and\r\nshrivelled appearance, and roughness, are owing to the mouths of the\r\nabsorbents being empty of their accustomed fluid, and is distinguishable\r\nfrom the dryness of the skin above mentioned in the hot fits of fever, by\r\nits not being attended with heat.\r\n\r\nAs the heat of the skin in the usual temperature of the air always evinces\r\nan increased perspiration, whether visible or not, the heat being produced\r\nalong with the increase of secretion; it follows, that a defect of\r\nperspiration can only exist, when the skin is cold.\r\n\r\n7. Volatile alcali is a very powerful diaphoretic, and particularly if\r\nexhibited in wine-whey; 20 drops of spirit of hartshorn every half hour in\r\nhalf a pint of wine-whey, if the patient be kept in a moderately warm bed,\r\nwill in a few hours elicit most profuse sweats.\r\n\r\nNeutral salts promote invisible perspiration, when the skin is not warmed\r\nmuch externally, as is evinced from the great thirst, which succeeds a meal\r\nof salt provisions, as of red herrings. When these are sufficiently diluted\r\nwith water, and the skin kept warm, copious sweats without inflaming the\r\nhabit, are the consequence. Half an ounce of vinegar saturated with\r\nvolatile alcali, taken every hour or two hours, well answers this purpose;\r\nand is preferable perhaps in general to all others, where sweating is\r\nadvantageous. Boerhaave mentions one cured of a fever by eating\r\nred-herrings or anchovies, which, with repeated draughts of warm water or\r\ntea, would I suppose produce copious perspiration.\r\n\r\nAntimonial preparations have also been of late much used with great\r\nadvantage as diaphoretics. For the history and use of these preparations I\r\nshall refer the reader to the late writers on the Materia Medica, only\r\nobserving that the stomach becomes so soon habituated to its stimulus, that\r\nthe second dose may be considerably increased, if the first had no\r\noperation.\r\n\r\nWhere it is advisable to procure copious sweats, the emetics, as\r\nipecacuanha, joined with opiates, as in Dover's powder, produce this effect\r\nwith greater certainty than the above.\r\n\r\n8. We must not dismiss this subject without observing, that perspiration is\r\ndesigned to keep the skin flexile, as the tears are intended to clean and\r\nlubricate the eye; and that neither of these fluids can be considered as\r\nexcretions in their natural state, but as secretions. See Class I. 1. 2. 3.\r\nAnd that therefore the principal use of diaphoretic medicines is to warm\r\nthe skin, and thence in consequence to produce the natural degree of\r\ninsensible perspiration in languid habits.\r\n\r\n9. When the skin of the extremities is cold, which is always a sign of\r\npresent debility, the digestion becomes frequently impaired by association,\r\nand cardialgia or heartburn is induced from the vinous or acetous\r\nfermentation of the aliment. In this disease diaphoretics, which have been\r\ncalled cordials, by their action on the stomach restore its exertion, and\r\nthat of the cutaneous capillaries by their association with it, and the\r\nskin becomes warm, and the digestion more vigorous.\r\n\r\n10. But a blister acts with more permanent and certain effect by\r\nstimulating a part of the skin, and thence affecting the whole of it, and\r\nof the stomach by association, and thence removes the most obstinate\r\nheartburns and vomitings. From this the principal use of blisters is\r\nunderstood, which is to invigorate the exertions of the arterial and\r\nlymphatic vessels of the skin, producing an increase of insensible\r\nperspiration, and of cutaneous absorption; and to increase the action of\r\nthe stomach, and the consequent power of digestion; and thence by sympathy\r\nto excite all the other irritative motions: hence they relieve pains of the\r\ncold kind, which originate from defect of motion; not from their\r\nintroducing a greater pain, as some have imagined, but by stimulating the\r\ntorpid vessels into their usual action; and thence increasing the action\r\nand consequent warmth of the whole skin, and of all the parts which are\r\nassociated with it.\r\n\r\nII. 1. _Sialagogues._ The preparations of mercury consist of a solution or\r\ncorrosion of that metal by some acid; and, when the dose is known, it is\r\nprobable that they are all equally efficacious. As their principal use is\r\nin the cure of the venereal disease, they will be mentioned in the\r\ncatalogue amongst the sorbentia. Where salivation is intended, it is much\r\nforwarded by a warm room and warm clothes; and prevented by exposing the\r\npatient to his usual habits of cool air and dress, as the mercury is then\r\nmore liable to go off by the bowels.\r\n\r\n2. Any acrid drug, as pyrethrum, held in the mouth acts as a sialagogue\r\nexternally by stimulating the excretory ducts of the salivary glands; and\r\nthe siliqua hirsuta applied externally to the parotid gland, and even hard\r\nsubstances in the ear, are said to have the same effect. Mastich chewed in\r\nthe mouth emulges the salivary glands.\r\n\r\n3. The unwise custom of chewing and smoking tobacco for many hours in a day\r\nnot only injures the salivary glands, producing dryness in the mouth when\r\nthis drug is not used, but I suspect that it also produces schirrhus of the\r\npancreas. The use of tobacco in this immoderate degree injures the power of\r\ndigestion, by occasioning the patient to spit out that saliva, which he\r\nought to swallow; and hence produces that flatulency, which the vulgar\r\nunfortunately take it to prevent. The mucus, which is brought from the\r\nfauces by hawking, should be spit out, as well as that coughed up from the\r\nlungs; but that which comes spontaneously into the mouth from the salivary\r\nglands, should be swallowed mixed with our food or alone for the purposes\r\nof digestion. See Class I. 2. 2. 7.\r\n\r\nIII. 1. Expectorants are supposed to increase the secretion of mucus in the\r\nbranches of the windpipe, or to increase the perspiration of the lungs\r\nsecreted at the terminations of the bronchial artery.\r\n\r\n2. If any thing promotes expectoration toward the end of peripneumonies,\r\nwhen the inflammation is reduced by bleeding and gentle cathartics, small\r\nrepeated blisters about the chest, with tepid aqueous and mucilaginous or\r\noily liquids, are more advantageous than the medicines generally enumerated\r\nunder this head; the blisters by stimulating into action the vessels of the\r\nskin produce by association a greater activity of those of the mucous\r\nmembrane, which lines the branches of the windpipe, and air-cells of the\r\nlungs; and thus after evacuation they promote the absorption of the mucus\r\nand consequent healing of the inflamed membrane, while the diluting liquids\r\nprevent this mucus from becoming too viscid for this purpose, or facilitate\r\nits expuition.\r\n\r\nBlisters, one at a time, on the sides or back, or on the sternum, are also\r\nuseful towards the end of peripneumonies, by preventing the evening access\r\nof cold fit, and thence preventing the hot fit by their stimulus on the\r\nskin; in the same manner as five drops of laudanum by its stimulus on the\r\nstomach. For the increased actions of the vessels of the skin or stomach\r\nexcite a greater quantity of the sensorial power of association, and thus\r\nprevent the torpor of the other parts of the system; which, when patients\r\nare debilitated, is so liable to return in the evening.\r\n\r\n3. Warm bathing is of great service towards the end of peripneumony to\r\npromote expectoration, especially in those children who drink too little\r\naqueous fluids, as it gently increases the action of the pulmonary\r\ncapillaries by their content with the cutaneous ones, and supplies the\r\nsystem with aqueous fluid, and thus dilutes the secreted mucus.\r\n\r\nSome have recommended oil externally around the chest, as well as\r\ninternally, to promote expectoration; and upon the nose, when its mucous\r\nmembrane is inflamed, as in common catarrh.\r\n\r\nIV. 1. Diuretics. If the skin be kept warm, most of these medicines promote\r\nsweat instead of urine; and if their dose is enlarged, most of them become\r\ncathartic. Hence the neutral salts are used in general for all these\r\npurposes. Those indeed, which are composed of the vegetable acid, are most\r\ngenerally used as sudorifics; those with the nitrous acid as diuretics; and\r\nthose with the vitriolic acid as cathartics: while those united with the\r\nmarine acid enter our common nutriment, as a more general stimulus. All\r\nthese increase the acrimony of the urine, hence it is retained a less time\r\nin the bladder; and in consequence less of it is reabsorbed into the\r\nsystem, and the apparent quantity is greater, as more is evacuated from the\r\nbladder; but it is not certain from thence, that a greater quantity is\r\nsecreted by the kidnies. Hence nitre, and other neutral salts, are\r\nerroneously given in the gonorrhoea; as they augment the pain of making\r\nwater by their stimulus on the excoriated or inflamed urethra. They are\r\nalso erroneously given in catarrhs or coughs, where the discharge is too\r\nthin and saline, as they increase the frequency of coughing.\r\n\r\n2. Balsam of Copaiva is thought to promote urine more than the other native\r\nbalsams; and common resin is said to act as a powerful diuretic in horses.\r\nThese are also much recommended in gleets, and in fluor albus, perhaps more\r\nthan they deserve; they give a violet smell to the urine, and hence\r\nprobably increase the secretion of it.\r\n\r\nCalcined egg-shells are said to promote urine, perhaps from the phosphoric\r\nacid they contain.\r\n\r\n3. Cold air and cold water will increase the quantity of urine by\r\ndecreasing the absorption from the bladder; and neutral and alcalious salts\r\nand cantharides by stimulating the neck of the bladder to discharge the\r\nurine as soon as secreted; and alcohol as gin and rum at the beginning of\r\nintoxication, if the body be kept cool, occasion much urine by inverting\r\nthe urinary lymphatics, and thence pouring a fluid into the bladder, which\r\nnever passed the kidnies. But it is probable, that those medicines, which\r\ngive a scent to the urine as the balsams and resins, but particularly\r\nasparagus and garlic, are the only drugs, which truly increase the\r\nsecretion of the kidnies. Alcohol however, used as above mentioned, and\r\nperhaps great doses of tincture of cantharides, may be considered as\r\ndrastic diuretics, as they pour a fluid into the bladder by the retrograde\r\naction of the lymphatics, which are in great abundance spread about the\r\nneck of it. See Sect. XXIX. 3.\r\n\r\nV. Mild cathartics. The ancients believed that some purges evacuated the\r\nbile, and hence were termed Cholagogues; others the lymph, and were termed\r\nHydragogues; and that in most each cathartic selected a peculiar humour,\r\nwhich it discharged. The moderns have too hastily rejected this system; the\r\nsubject well deserves further observation.\r\n\r\nCalomel given in the dose from ten to twenty grains, so as to induce\r\npurging without the assistance of other drugs, appears to me to\r\nparticularly increase the secretion of bile, and to evacuate it; aloe seems\r\nto increase the secretion of the intestinal mucus; and it is probable that\r\nthe pancreas and spleen may be peculiarly stimulated into action by some\r\nother of this tribe of medicines; whilst others of them may simply\r\nstimulate the intestinal canal to evacuate its contents, as the bile of\r\nanimals. It must be remarked, that all these cathartic medicines are\r\nsupposed to be exhibited in their usual doses, otherwise they become\r\ndrastic purges, and are treated of in the Class of Invertentia.\r\n\r\nVI. The mucus of the bladder is seen in the urine, when cantharides have\r\nbeen used, either internally or externally, in such doses as to induce the\r\nstrangury. Spirit of turpentine is said to have the same effect. I have\r\ngiven above a dram of it twice a day floating on a glass of water in\r\nchronic lumbago without this effect, and the patient gradually recovered.\r\n\r\nVII. Aloe given internally seems to act chiefly on the rectum and, spincter\r\nani, producing tenesmus and piles. Externally in clysters or suppositories,\r\ncommon salt seems to act on that bowel with greater certainty. But where\r\nthe thread-worm or ascarides exist, 60 or 100 grains of aloes reduced to\r\npowder and boiled in a pint of gruel, and used as a clyster twice a week\r\nfor three months, has frequently destroyed them.\r\n\r\nVIII. The external application of cantharides by stimulating the excretory\r\nducts of the capillary glands produces a great secretion of subcutaneous\r\nmucus with pain and inflammation; which mucaginous fluid, not being able to\r\npermeate the cuticle, raises it up; a similar secretion and elevation of\r\nthe cuticle is produced by actual fire; and by caustic materials, as by the\r\napplication of the juice of the root of white briony, or bruised\r\nmustard-seed. Experiments are wanting to introduce some acrid application\r\ninto practice instead of cantharides, which might not induce the strangury.\r\n\r\nMustard-seed alone is too acrid, and if it be suffered to lie on the skin\r\nmany minutes is liable to produce a slough and consequent ulcer, and should\r\ntherefore be mixed with flour when applied to cold extremities. Volatile\r\nalkali properly diluted might stimulate the skin without inducing\r\nstrangury.\r\n\r\nIX. The mild errhines are such as moderately stimulate the membrane of the\r\nnostrils, so as to increase the secretion of nasal mucus; as is seen in\r\nthose, who are habituated to take snuff. The stronger errhines are\r\nmentioned in Art. V. 2. 3.\r\n\r\nX. The secretion of tears is increased either by applying acrid substances\r\nto the eye; or acrid vapours, which stimulate the excretory duct of the\r\nlacrymal gland; or by applying them to the nostrils, and stimulating the\r\nexcretory duct of the lacrymal sack, as treated of in the Section on\r\nInstinct.\r\n\r\nOr the secretion of tears is increased by the association of the motions of\r\nthe excretory duct of the lacrymal sack with ideas of tender pleasure, or\r\nof hopeless distress, as explained in Sect. XVI. 8. 2. and 3.\r\n\r\nXI. The secretion of sensorial power in the brain is probably increased by\r\nopium or wine, because when taken in certain quantity an immediate increase\r\nof strength and activity succeeds for a time, with consequent debility if\r\nthe quantity taken be so great as to intoxicate in the least degree. The\r\nnecessity of perpetual respiration shews, that the oxygen of the atmosphere\r\nsupplies the source of the spirit of animation; which is constantly\r\nexpended, and is probably too fine to be long contained in the nerves after\r\nits production in the brain. Whence it is probable, that the respiration of\r\noxygen gas mixed with common air may increase the secretion of sensorial\r\npower; as indeed would appear from its exhilarating effect on most\r\npatients.\r\n\r\nIII.

Secretion of mucus of the rectum is increased by aloe internally, by\r\nvarious clysters and suppositories externally.\r\n\r\nVIII. Secretion of subcutaneous mucus is increased by blisters of\r\ncantharides, by application of a thin slice of the fresh root of white\r\nbriony, by sinapisms, by root of horse-radish, cochlearia armoracia.\r\nVolatile alcali.\r\n\r\nIX.

Secretion of sensorial power in the brain is probably increased by\r\nopium, by wine, and perhaps by oxygen gas added to the common air in\r\nrespiration.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nART. IV.\r\n\r\nSORBENTIA.\r\n\r\nI. Those things which increase the irritative motions, which constitute\r\nabsorption, are termed sorbentia; and are as various as the absorbent\r\nvessels, which they stimulate into action.\r\n\r\n1. Cutaneous absorption is increased by austere acids, as of vitriol; hence\r\nthey are believed to check colliquative sweats, and to check the eruption\r\nof small-pox, and contribute to the cure of the itch, and tinea; hence they\r\nthicken the saliva in the mouth, as lemon-juice, crab-juice, sloes.\r\n\r\n2. Absorption from the mucous membrane is increased by opium, and Peruvian\r\nbark, internally; and by blue vitriol externally. Hence the expectoration\r\nin coughs, and the mucous discharge from the urethra, are thickened and\r\nlessened.\r\n\r\n3. Absorption from the cellular membrane is promoted by bitter vegetables,\r\nand by emetics, and cathartics. Hence matter is thickened and lessened in\r\nulcers by opium and Peruvian bark; and serum is absorbed in anasarca by the\r\noperation of emetics and cathartics.\r\n\r\n4. Venous absorption is increased by acrid vegetables; as water-cress,\r\ncellery, horse-radish, mustard. Hence their use in sea-scurvy, the vibices\r\nof which are owing to a defect of venous absorption; and by external\r\nstimulants, as vinegar, and by electricity, and perhaps by oxygen.\r\n\r\n5. Intestinal absorption is increased by astringent vegetables, as rhubarb,\r\ngalls; and by earthy salts, as alum; and by argillaceous and calcareous\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n6. Hepatic absorption is increased by metallic salts, hence calomel and sal\r\nmartis are so efficacious in jaundice, worms, chlorosis, dropsy.\r\n\r\n7. Venereal virus in ulcers is absorbed by the stimulus of mercury; hence\r\nthey heal by the use of this medicine.\r\n\r\n8. Venesection, hunger, thirst, and violent evacuations, increase all\r\nabsorptions; hence sweating produces costiveness.\r\n\r\n9. Externally bitter astringent vegetables, earthy and metallic salts, and\r\nbandages, promote the absorption of the parts on which they are applied.\r\n\r\n10. All these in their usual doses do not increase the natural heat; but\r\nthey induce costiveness, and deep coloured urine with earthy sediment.\r\n\r\nIn greater doses they invert the motions of the stomach and lacteals; and\r\nhence vomit or purge, as carduus benedictus, rhubarb. They promote\r\nperspiration, if the skin be kept warm; as camomile tea, and testaceous\r\npowders, have been used as sudorifics.\r\n\r\nThe preparations of antimony vomit, purge, or sweat, either according to\r\nthe quantity exhibited, or as a part of what is given is evacuated. Thus a\r\nquarter of a grain of emetic tartar (if well prepared) will promote a\r\ndiaphoresis, if the skin be kept warm; half a grain will procure a stool or\r\ntwo first, and sweating afterwards; and a grain will generally vomit, and\r\nthen purge, and lastly sweat the patient. In less quantity it is probable,\r\nthat this medicine acts like other metallic salts, as steel, zinc, or\r\ncopper in small doses; that is, that it strengthens the system by its\r\nstimulus. As camomile or rhubarb in different doses vomit, or purge, or act\r\nas stimulants so as to strengthen the system.\r\n\r\nII. OBSERVATIONS ON THE SORBENTIA.\r\n\r\nI. 1. As there is great difference in the apparent structure of the various\r\nglands, and of the fluids which they select from the blood, these glands\r\nmust possess different kinds of irritability, and are therefore stimulated\r\ninto stronger or unnatural actions by different articles of the materia\r\nmedica, as shewn in the secernentia. Now as the absorbent vessels are\r\nlikewise glands, and drink up or select different fluids, as chyle, water,\r\nmucus, with a part of every different secretion, as a part of the bile, a\r\npart of the saliva, a part of the urine, &c. it appears, that these\r\nabsorbent vessels must likewise possess different kinds of irritability,\r\nand in consequence must require different articles of the materia medica to\r\nexcite them into unusual action. This part of the subject has been so\r\nlittle attended to, that the candid reader will find in this article a\r\ngreat deal to excuse.\r\n\r\nIt was observed, that some of the secernentia did in a less degree increase\r\nabsorption, from the combination of different properties in the same\r\nvegetable body; for the same reason some of the class of sorbentia produce\r\nsecretion in a less degree, as those bitters which have also an aroma in\r\ntheir composition; these are known from their increasing the heat of the\r\nsystem above its usual degree.\r\n\r\nIt must also be noted, that the actions of every part of the absorbent\r\nsystem are so associated with each other, that the drugs which stimulate\r\none branch increase the action of the whole; and the torpor or quiescence\r\nof one branch weakens the exertions of the whole; or when one branch is\r\nexcited into stronger action, some other branch has its actions weakened or\r\ninverted. Yet though peculiar branches of the absorbent system are\r\nstimulated into action by peculiar substances, there are other substances\r\nwhich seem to stimulate the whole system, and that without immediately\r\nincreasing any of the secretions; as those bitters which possess no\r\naromatic scent, at the head of which stands the famed Peruvian bark, or\r\ncinchona.\r\n\r\n2. Cutaneous absorption. I have heard of some experiments, in which the\r\nbody was kept cold, and was thought to absorb more moisture from the\r\natmosphere than at any other time. This however cannot be determined by\r\nstatical experiments; as the capillary vessels, which secrete the\r\nperspirable matter, must at the same time have been benumbed by the cold;\r\nand from their inaction there could not have been the usual waste of the\r\nweight of the body; and as all other muscular exertions are best performed,\r\nwhen the body possesses its usual degree of warmth, it is conclusive, that\r\nthe absorbent system should likewise do its office best, when it is not\r\nbenumbed by external cold.\r\n\r\nThe austere acids, as of vitriol, lemon-juice, juice of crabs and sloes,\r\nstrengthen digestion, and prevent that propensity to sweat so usual to weak\r\nconvalescents, and diminish the colliquative sweats in hectic fevers; all\r\nwhich are owing to their increasing the action of the external and internal\r\ncutaneous absorption. Hence vitriolic acid is given in the small-pox to\r\nprevent the too hasty or too copious eruption, which it effects, by\r\nincreasing the cutaneous absorption. Vinegar, from the quantity of alcohol\r\nwhich it contains, exerts a contrary effect to that here described, and\r\nbelongs to the incitantia; as an ounce of it promotes sweat, and a flushing\r\nof the skin; at the same time externally it acts as a venous absorbent, as\r\nthe lips become pale by moistening them with it. And it is said, when taken\r\ninternally in great and continued quantity, to induce paleness of the skin,\r\nand softness of the bones.\r\n\r\nThe sweet vegetable acids, as of several ripe fruits, are among the\r\ntorpentia; as they are less stimulating than the general food of this\r\nclimate, and are hence used in inflammatory diseases.\r\n\r\nWhere the quantity of fluids in the system is much lessened, as in hectic\r\nfever, which has been of some continuance, or in spurious peripneumony, a\r\ngrain of opium given at night will sometimes prevent the appearance of\r\nsweats; which is owing to the stimulus of opium increasing the actions of\r\nthe cutaneous absorbents, more than those of the secerning vessels of the\r\nskin. Whence the secretion of perspirable matter is not decreased, but its\r\nappearance on the skin is prevented by its more facile absorption.\r\n\r\n3. There is one kind of itch, which seldom appears between the fingers, is\r\nthe least infectious, and most difficult to eradicate, and which has its\r\ncure much facilitated by the internal use of acid of vitriol. This disease\r\nconsists of small ulcers in the skin, which are healed by whatever\r\nincreases the cutaneous absorption. The external application of sulphur,\r\nmercury, and acrid vegetables, acts on the same principle; for the\r\nanimalcula, which are seen in these pustules, are the effect, not the\r\ncause, of them; as all other stagnating animal fluids, as the semen itself,\r\nabounds with similar microscopic animals.\r\n\r\n4. Young children have sometimes an eruption upon the head called Tinea,\r\nwhich discharges an acrimonius ichor inflaming the parts, on which it\r\nfalls. This eruption I have seen submit to the internal use of vitriolic\r\nacid, when only wheat-flour was applied externally. This kind of eruption\r\nis likewise frequently cured by testaceous powders; two materials so widely\r\ndifferent in their chemical properties, but agreeing in their power of\r\npromoting cutaneous absorption.\r\n\r\nII. Absorption from the mucous membrane is increased by applying to its\r\nsurface the austere acids, as of vitriol, lemon-juice, crab-juice, sloes.\r\nWhen these are taken into the mouth, they immediately thicken, and at the\r\nsame time lessen the quantity of the saliva; which last circumstance cannot\r\nbe owing to their coagulating the saliva, but to their increasing the\r\nabsorption of the thinner parts of it. So alum applied to the tip of the\r\ntongue does not stop in its action there, but independent of its diffusion\r\nit induces cohesion and corrugation over the whole mouth. (Cullen's Mat.\r\nMed. Art. Astringentia.) Which is owing to the association of the motions\r\nof the parts or branches of the absorbent system with each other.\r\n\r\nAbsorption from the mucous membrane is increased by opium taken internally\r\nin small doses more than by any other medicine, as is seen in its\r\nthickening the expectoration in coughs, and the discharge from the nostrils\r\nin catarrh, and perhaps the discharge from the urethra in gonorrhoea. The\r\nbark seems next in power for all these purposes.\r\n\r\nExternally slight solutions of blue vitriol, as two or three grains to an\r\nounce of water, applied to ulcers of the mouth, or to chancres on the glans\r\npenis, more powerfully induces them to heal than any other material.\r\n\r\nWhere the lungs or urethra are inflamed to a considerable degree, and the\r\nabsorption is so great, that the mucus is already too thick, and adheres to\r\nthe membrane from its viscidity, opiates and bitter vegetable and austere\r\nacids are improper; and mucilaginous diluents should be used in their stead\r\nwith venesection and torpentia.\r\n\r\nIII. 1. Absorption from the cellular membrane, and from all the other\r\ncavities of the body, is too slowly performed in some constitutions; hence\r\nthe bloated pale complexion; and when this occurs in its greatest degree,\r\nit becomes an universal dropsy. These habits are liable to intermittent\r\nfevers, hysteric paroxysms, cold extremities, indigestion, and all the\r\nsymptoms of debility.\r\n\r\nThe absorbent system is more subject to torpor or quiescence than the\r\nsecerning system, both from the coldness of the fluids which are applied to\r\nit, as the moisture of the atmosphere, and from the coldness of the fluids\r\nwhich we drink; and also from its being stimulated only by intervals, as\r\nwhen we take our food; whereas the secerning system is perpetually excited\r\ninto action by the warm circulating blood; as explained in Sect. XXXII.\r\n\r\n2. The Peruvian bark, camomile flowers, and other bitter drugs, by\r\nstimulating this cellular branch of the absorbent system prevents it from\r\nbecoming quiescent; hence the cold paroxysms of those agues, which arise\r\nfrom the torpor of the cellular lymphatics, are prevented, and the hot fits\r\nin consequence. The patient thence preserves his natural heat, regains his\r\nhealthy colour, and his accustomed strength.\r\n\r\nWhere the cold paroxysm of an ague originates in the absorbents of the\r\nliver, spleen, or other internal viscus, the addition of steel to vegetable\r\nbitters, and especially after the use of one dose of calomel, much advances\r\nthe cure.\r\n\r\nAnd where it originates in any part of the secerning system, as is probably\r\nthe case in some kinds of agues, the addition of opium in the dose of a\r\ngrain and half, given about an hour before the access of the paroxysm, or\r\nmixed with chalybeate and bitter medicines, ensures the cure. Or the same\r\nmay be effected by wine given instead of opium before the paroxysm, so as\r\nnearly to intoxicate.\r\n\r\nThese three kinds of agues are thus distinguished; the first is not\r\nattended with any tumid or indurated viscus, which the people call an ague\r\ncake, and which is evident to the touch. The second is accompanied with a\r\ntumid viscus; and the last has generally, I believe, the quartan type, and\r\nis attended with some degree of arterial debility.\r\n\r\n3. This class of absorbent medicines are said to decrease irritability.\r\nAfter any part of our system has been torpid or quiescent, by whatever\r\ncause that was produced, it becomes afterwards capable of being excited\r\ninto greater motion by small stimuli; hence the hot fit of fever succeeds\r\nthe cold one. As these medicines prevent torpor or quiescence of parts of\r\nthe system, as cold hands or feet, which perpetually happen to weak\r\nconstitutions, the subsequent increase of irritability of these parts is\r\nlikewise prevented.\r\n\r\n4. These absorbent medicines, including both the bitters, and metallic\r\nsalts, and opiates, are of great use in the dropsy by their promoting\r\nuniversal absorption; but here evacuations are likewise to be produced, as\r\nwill be treated of in the Invertentia.\r\n\r\n5. The matter in ulcers is thickened, and thence rendered less corrosive,\r\nthe saline part of it being reabsorbed by the use of bitter medicines;\r\nhence the bark is used with advantage in the cure of ulcers.\r\n\r\n6. Bitter medicines strengthen digestion by promoting the absorption of\r\nchyle; hence the introduction of hop into the potation used at our meals,\r\nwhich as a medicine may be taken advantageously, but, like other\r\nunnecessary stimuli, must be injurious as an article of our daily diet.\r\n\r\nThe hop may perhaps in some degree contribute to the production of gravel\r\nin the kidnies, as our intemperate wine-drinkers are more subject to the\r\ngout, and ale-drinkers to the gravel; in the formation of both which\r\ndiseases, there can be no doubt, but that the alcohol is the principal, if\r\nnot the only agent.\r\n\r\n7. Vomits greatly increase the absorption from the cellular membrane, as\r\nsquill, and foxglove. The squill should be given in the dose of a grain of\r\nthe dried root every hour, till it operates upwards and downwards. Four\r\nounces of the fresh leaves of the foxglove should be boiled from two pounds\r\nof water to one, and half an ounce of the decoction taken every two hours\r\nfor four or more doses. This medicine by stimulating into inverted action\r\nthe absorbents of the stomach, increases the direct action of the cellular\r\nlymphatics.\r\n\r\nAnother more convenient way of ascertaining the dose of foxglove is by\r\nmaking a saturated tincture of it in proof spirit; which has the twofold\r\nadvantage of being invariable in its original strength, and of keeping a\r\nlong time as a shop-medicine without losing any of its virtue. Put two\r\nounces of the leaves of purple foxglove, digitalis purpurea, nicely dried,\r\nand coarsely powdered, into a mixture of four ounces of rectified spirit of\r\nwine and four ounces of water; let the mixture stand by the fire-side\r\ntwenty-four hours frequently shaking the bottle, and thus making a\r\nsaturated tincture of digitalis; which must be poured from the sediment or\r\npassed through filtering paper.\r\n\r\nAs the size of a drop is greater or less according to the size of the rim\r\nof the phial from which it is dropped, a part of this saturated tincture is\r\nthen directed to be put into a two-ounce phial, for the purpose of\r\nascertaining the size of the drop. Thirty drops of this tincture is\r\ndirected to be put into an ounce of mint-water for a draught to be taken\r\ntwice or thrice a day, till it reduces the anasarca of the limbs, or\r\nremoves the difficulty of breathing in hydrothorax, or till it induces\r\nsickness. And if these do not occur in two or three days, the dose must be\r\ngradually increased to forty or sixty drops, or further.\r\n\r\nFrom the great stimulus of this medicine the stomach is rendered torpid\r\nwith consequent sickness, which continues many hours and even days, owing\r\nto the great exhaustion of its sensorial power of irritation; and the\r\naction of the heart and arteries becomes feeble from the deficient\r\nexcitement of the sensorial power of association; and lastly, the\r\nabsorbents of the cellular membrane act more violently in consequence of\r\nthe accumulation of the sensorial power of association in the torpid heart\r\nand arteries, as explained in Suppl. I. 12.\r\n\r\nA circumstance curiously similar to this occurs to some people on smoking\r\ntobacco for a short time, who have not been accustomed to it. A degree of\r\nsickness is presently induced, and the pulsations of the heart and arteries\r\nbecome feeble for a short time, as in the approach to fainting, owing to\r\nthe direct sympathy between these and the stomach, that is from defect of\r\nthe excitement of the power of association. Then there succeeds a tingling,\r\nand heat, and sometimes sweat, owing to the increased action of the\r\ncapillaries, or perspirative and mucous glands; which is occasioned by the\r\naccumulation of the sensorial power of association by the weaker action of\r\nthe heart and arteries, which now increases the action of the capillaries.\r\n\r\n8. Another method of increasing absorption from the cellular membrane is by\r\nwarm air, or by warm steam. If the swelled legs of a dropsical patient are\r\ninclosed in a box, the air of which is made warm by a lamp or two, copious\r\nsweats are soon produced by the increased action of the capillary glands,\r\nwhich are seen to stand on the skin, as it cannot readily exhale in so\r\nsmall a quantity of air, which is only changed so fast as may be necessary\r\nto permit the lamps to burn. At the same time the lymphatics of the\r\ncellular membrane are stimulated by the heat into greater action, as\r\nappears by the speedy reduction of the tumid legs.\r\n\r\nIt would be well worth trying an experiment upon a person labouring under a\r\ngeneral anasarca by putting him into a room filled with air heated to 120\r\nor 130 degrees, which would probably excite a great general diaphoresis,\r\nand a general cellular absorption both from the lungs and every other part.\r\nAnd that air of so great heat may be borne for many minutes without great\r\ninconvenience was shewn by the experiments made in heated rooms by Dr.\r\nFordyce and others. Philos. Trans.\r\n\r\nAnother experiment of using warmth in anasarca, or in other diseases, might\r\nbe by immersing the patient in warm air, or in warm steam, received into an\r\noil-skin bag, or bathing-tub of tin, so managed, that the current of warm\r\nair or steam should pass round and cover the whole of the body except the\r\nhead, which might not be exposed to it; and thus the absorbents of the\r\nlungs might be induced to act more powerfully by sympathy with the skin,\r\nand not by the stimulus of heat. See Uses of Warm Bath, Art. II. 2. 2. 1.\r\n\r\nIV. 1. Venous absorption. Cellary, water-cresses, cabbages, and many other\r\nvegetables of the Class Tetradynamia, do not increase the heat of the body\r\n(except those whose acrimony approaches to corrosion), and hence they seem\r\nalone, or principally, to act on the venous system; the extremities of\r\nwhich we have shewn are absorbents of the red blood, after it has passed\r\nthe capillaries and glands.\r\n\r\n2. In the sea-scurvy and petechial fever the veins do not perfectly perform\r\nthis office of absorption; and hence the vibices are occasioned by blood\r\nstagnating at their extremities, or extravasated into the cellular\r\nmembrane. And this class of vegetables, stimulating the veins to perform\r\ntheir natural absorption, without increasing the energy of the arterial\r\naction, prevents future petechiæ, and may assist the absorption of the\r\nblood already stagnated, as soon as its chemical change renders it proper\r\nfor that operation.\r\n\r\n3. The fluids, which are extravasated, and received into the cells of the\r\ncellular membrane, seem to continue there for many days, so as to undergo\r\nsome chemical change, and are then taken up again by the mouths of the\r\ncellular absorbents. But the new vessels produced in inflamed parts, as\r\nthey communicate with the veins, are probably absorbed again by the veins\r\nalong with the blood which they contain in their cavities. Hence the blood,\r\nwhich is extravasated in bruises or vibices, is gradually many days in\r\ndisappearing; but after due evacuations the inflamed vessels on the white\r\nof the eye, if any stimulant lotion is applied, totally disappear in a few\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nAmongst absorbents affecting the veins we should therefore add the external\r\napplication of stimulant materials; as of vinegar, which makes the lips\r\npale on touching them. Friction, and electricity.\r\n\r\n4. Hæmorrhages are of two kinds, either arterial, which are attended with\r\ninflammation; or venous, from a deficiency in the absorbent power of this\r\nset of vessels. In the former case the torpentia are efficacious; in the\r\nlatter steel, opium, alum, and all the tribe of sorbentia, are used with\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n5. Sydenham recommends vegetables of the class Tetradynamia in rheumatic\r\npains left after the cure of intermittents. These pains are perhaps similar\r\nto those of the sea-scurvy, and seem to arise from want of absorption in\r\nthe affected part, and hence are relieved by the same medicines.\r\n\r\nV. 1. Intestinal absorption. Some astringent vegetables, as rhubarb, may be\r\ngiven in such doses as to prove cathartic; and, after a part of it is\r\nevacuated from the body, the remaining part augments the absorption of the\r\nintestines; and acts, as if a similar dose had been exhibited after the\r\noperation of any other purgative. Hence 4 grains of rhubarb strengthen the\r\nbowels, 30 grains first empty them.\r\n\r\n2. The earthy salts, as alum, increase the intestinal absorption, and hence\r\ninduce constipation in their usual dose; alum is said sometimes to cure\r\nintermittents, perhaps when their seat is in the intestines, when other\r\nremedies have failed. It is useful in the diabætes by exciting the\r\nabsorbents of the bladder into their natural action; and combined with\r\nresin is esteemed in the fluor albus, and in gleets. Lime-stone or chalk,\r\nand probably gypsum, possess effects in some degree similar, and increase\r\nthe absorption of the intestines; and thus in certain doses restrain some\r\ndiarrhoeas, but in greater doses alum I suppose will act as a cathartic.\r\nFive or ten grains produce constipation, 20 or 30 grains are either emetic\r\nor cathartic.\r\n\r\n3. Earth of alum, tobacco-pipe clay, marl, Armenian bole, lime, crab's eyes\r\nor claws, and calcined hartshorn, or bone ashes, restrain fluxes; either\r\nmechanically by supplying something like mucilage, or oil, or rollers to\r\nabate the friction of the aliment over inflamed membranes; or by increasing\r\ntheir absorption. The two last consist of calcareous earth united to\r\nphosphoric acid, and the Armenian bole and marl may contain iron. By the\r\nconsent between the intestines and the skin 20 grains of Armenian bole\r\ngiven at going into bed to hectic patients will frequently check their\r\ntendency to sweat as well as to purge, and the more certainly if joined\r\nwith one grain of opium.\r\n\r\nVI. 1. Absorption from the liver, stomach, and other viscera. When\r\ninflammations of the liver are subdued to a certain degree by venesection,\r\nwith calomel and other gentle purges, so that the arterial energy becomes\r\nweakened, four or eight grains of iron-filings, or of salt of steel, with\r\nthe Peruvian bark, have wonderful effect in curing the cough, and restoring\r\nthe liver to its usual size and sanity; which it seems to effect by\r\nincreasing the absorption of this viscus. The same I suppose happens in\r\nrespect to the tumours of other viscera, as of the spleen, or pancreas,\r\nsome of which are frequently enlarged in agues.\r\n\r\n2. Hæmorrhages from the nose, rectum, kidnies, uterus, and other parts, are\r\nfrequently attendant on diseased livers; the blood being impeded in the\r\nvena portarum from the decreased power of absorption, and in consequence of\r\nthe increased size of this viscus. These hæmorrhages after venesection, and\r\na mercurial cathartic, are most certainly restrained by steel alone, or\r\njoined with an opiate; which increase the absorption, and diminish the size\r\nof the liver.\r\n\r\nChalybeates may also restrain these hæmorrhages by their promoting venous\r\nabsorption, though they exert their principal effect upon the liver. Hence\r\nalso opiates, and bitters, and vitriolic acid, are advantageously used\r\nalong with them. It must be added that some hæmorrhages recur by periods\r\nlike the paroxysms of intermittent fevers, and are thence cured by the same\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\n3. The jaundice is frequently caused by the insipidity of the bile, which\r\ndoes not stimulate the gall-bladder and bile-ducts into their due action;\r\nhence it stagnates in the gall-bladder, and produces a kind of\r\ncrystallization, which is too large to pass into the intestines, blocks up\r\nthe bile-duct, and occasions a long and painful disease. A paralysis of the\r\nbile duct produces a similar jaundice, but without pain.\r\n\r\n4. Worms in sheep called flukes are owing to the dilute state of the bile;\r\nhence they originate in the intestines, and thence migrate into the biliary\r\nducts, and corroding the liver produce ulcers, cough, and hectic fever,\r\ncalled the rot. In human bodies it is probable the inert state of the bile\r\nis one cause of the production of worms; which insipid state of the bile is\r\nowing to deficient absorption of the thinner parts of it; hence the pale\r\nand bloated complexion, and swelled upper lip, of wormy children, is owing\r\nto the concomitant deficiency of absorption from the cellular membrane.\r\nSalt of steel, or the rust of it, or filings of it, with bitters, increase\r\nthe acrimony of the bile by promoting the absorption of its aqueous part;\r\nand hence destroy worms, as well as by their immediate action on the\r\nintestines, or on the worms themselves. The cure is facilitated by\r\npremising a purge with calomel. See Class I. 2. 3. 9.\r\n\r\n5. The chlorosis is another disease owing to the deficient action of the\r\nabsorbents of the liver, and perhaps in some degree also to that of the\r\nsecretory vessels, or glands, which compose that viscus. Of this the want\r\nof the catameniæ, which is generally supposed to be a cause, is only a\r\nsymptom or consequence. In this complaint the bile is deficient perhaps in\r\nquantity, but certainly in acrimony, the thinner parts not being absorbed\r\nfrom it. Now as the bile is probably of great consequence in the process of\r\nmaking the blood; it is on this account that the blood is so destitute of\r\nred globules; which is evinced by the great paleness of these patients. As\r\nthis serous blood must exert less stimulus on the heart, and arteries, the\r\npulse in consequence becomes quick as well as weak, as explained in Sect.\r\nXII. 1. 4.\r\n\r\nThe quickness of the pulse is frequently so great and permanent, that when\r\nattended by an accidental cough, the disease may be mistaken for hectic\r\nfever; but is cured by chalybeates, and bitters exhibited twice a day; with\r\nhalf a grain of opium, and a grain of aloe every night; and the expected\r\ncatamenia appears in consequence of a restoration of the due quantity of\r\nred blood. This and the two former articles approach to the disease termed\r\nparalysis of the liver. Sect. XXX. 1. 4.\r\n\r\n6. It seems paradoxical, that the same treatment with chalybeates, bitters,\r\nand opiates, which produces menstruation in chlorotic patients, should\r\nrepress the too great or permanent menstruation, which occurs in weak\r\nconstitutions at the time of life when it should cease. This complaint is\r\nan hæmorrhage owing to the debility of the absorbent power of the veins,\r\nand belongs to the paragraph on venous absorption above described, and is\r\nthence curable by chalybeates, alum, bitters, and particularly by the\r\nexhibition of a grain of opium every night with five grains of rhubarb.\r\n\r\n7. Metallic salts supply us with very powerful remedies for promoting\r\nabsorption in dropsical cases; which frequently are caused by enlargement\r\nof the liver. First, as they may be given in such quantities as to prove\r\nstrongly cathartic, of which more will be said in the article on\r\ninvertentia; and then, when their purgative quality ceases, like the effect\r\nof rhubarb, their absorbent quality continues to act. The salts of mercury,\r\nsilver, copper, iron, zinc, antimony, have all been used in the dropsy;\r\neither singly for the former purpose, or united with bitters for the\r\nlatter, and occasionally with moderate but repeated opiates.\r\n\r\n8. From a quarter of a grain to half a grain of blue vitriol given every\r\nfour or six hours, is said to be very efficacious in obstinate\r\nintermittents; which also frequently arise from an enlarged viscus, as the\r\nliver or spleen, and are thence owing to the deficient absorption of the\r\nlymphatics of that viscus. A quarter of a grain of white arsenic, as I was\r\ninformed by a surgeon of the army, cures a quartan ague with great\r\ncertainty, if it be given an hour before the expected fit. This dose he\r\nsaid was for a robust man, perhaps one eighth of a grain might be given and\r\nrepeated with greater safety and equal efficacy.\r\n\r\nDr. Fowler has given many successful cases in his treatise on this subject.\r\nHe prepares it by boiling sixty-four grains of white arsenic in a Florence\r\nflask along with as much pure vegetable fixed alcali in a pint of distilled\r\nwater, till it is dissolved, and then adding to it as much distilled water\r\nas will make the whole exactly sixteen ounces. Hence there are four grains\r\nof arsenic in every ounce of the solution. This should be put into a phial\r\nof such a size of the edge of its aperture, that sixty drops may weigh one\r\ndram, which will contain half a grain of arsenic. To children from two\r\nyears old to four he gives from two to five drops three or four times a\r\nday. From five years old to seven, he directs seven or eight drops. From\r\neight years old to twelve, he directs from seven to ten drops. From\r\nthirteen years old to eighteen he directs from ten to twelve drops. From\r\neighteen upwards, twelve drops. In so powerful a medicine it is always\r\nprudent to begin with smaller doses, and gradually to increase them.\r\n\r\nA saturated solution of arsenic in water is preferable I think to the above\r\noperose preparation of it; as no error can happen in weighing the\r\ningredients, and it more certainly therefore possesses an uniform strength.\r\nPut much more white arsenic reduced to powder into a given quantity of\r\ndistilled water, than can be dissolved in it. Boil it for half an hour in a\r\nFlorence flask, or in a tin sauce-pan; let it stand to subside, and filter\r\nit through paper. My friend Mr. Greene, a surgeon at Brewood in\r\nStaffordshire, assured me, that he had cured in one season agues without\r\nnumber with this saturated solution; that he found ten drops from a\r\ntwo-ounce phial given thrice a day was a full dose for a grown person, but\r\nthat he generally began with five.\r\n\r\n9. The manner, in which arsenic acts in curing intermittent fevers, cannot\r\nbe by its general stimulus, because no intoxication or heat follows the use\r\nof it; nor by its peculiar stimulus on any part of the secreting system,\r\nsince it is not in small doses succeeded by any increased evacuation, or\r\nheat, and must therefore exert its power, like other articles of the\r\nsorbentia, on the absorbent system. In what manner it destroys life so\r\nsuddenly is difficult to understand, as it does not intoxicate like many\r\nvegetable poisons, nor produce fevers like contagious matter. When applied\r\nexternally it seems chemically to destroy the part like other caustics.\r\nDoes it chemically destroy the stomach, and life in consequence? or does it\r\ndestroy the action of the stomach by its great stimulus, and life in\r\nconsequence of the sympathy between the stomach and the heart? This last\r\nappears to be the most probable mode of its operation.\r\n\r\nThe success of arsenic in the cure of intermittent fevers I suspect to\r\ndepend on its stimulating the stomach into stronger action, and thus, by\r\nthe association of this viscus with the heart and arteries, preventing the\r\ntorpor of any part of the sanguiferous system. I was led to this conclusion\r\nfrom the following considerations.\r\n\r\nFirst. The effects of arsenic given a long time internally in small doses,\r\nor when used in larger quantities externally, seem to be similar to those\r\nof other great stimuli, as of wine or alcohol. These are a bloated\r\ncountenance, swelled legs, hepatic tumours, and dropsy, and sometimes\r\neruptions on the skin. The former of these I have seen, where arsenic has\r\nbeen used externally for curing the itch; and the latter appears on\r\nevidence in the famous trial of Miss Blandy at Chelmsford, about forty\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\nSecondly. I saw an ague cured by arsenic in a child, who had in vain\r\npreviously taken a very large quantity of bark with great regularity. And\r\nanother case of a young officer, who had lived intemperately, and laboured\r\nunder an intermittent fever, and had taken the bark repeatedly in\r\nconsiderable quantities, with a grain of opium at night, and though the\r\nparoxysms had been thrice thus for a time prevented, they recurred in about\r\na week. On taking five drops of a saturated solution of arsenic thrice a\r\nday the paroxysms ceased, and returned no more, and at the same time his\r\nappetite became much improved.\r\n\r\nThirdly. A gentleman about 65 years of age had for about ten years been\r\nsubject to an intermittent pulse, and to frequent palpitations of his\r\nheart. Lately the palpitations seemed to observe irregular periods, but the\r\nintermission of every third or fourth pulsation was almost perpetual. On\r\ngiving him four drops of a saturated solution of arsenic from a two-ounce\r\nphial about every four hours for one day, not only the palpitation did not\r\nreturn, but the intermission ceased entirely, and did not return so long as\r\nhe took the medicine, which was three or four days.\r\n\r\nNow as when the stomach has its action much weakened by an over-dose of\r\ndigitalis, the pulse is liable to intermit, this evinces a direct sympathy\r\nbetween these parts of the system, and as I have repeatedly observed, that\r\nwhen the pulse begins to intermit in elderly people, that an eructation\r\nfrom the stomach, voluntarily produced, will prevent the threatened stop of\r\nthe heart; I am induced to think, that the torpid state of the stomach, at\r\nthe instant of the production of air occasioned by its weak action, caused\r\nthe intermission of the pulse. And that arsenic in this case, as well as in\r\nthe cases of agues above mentioned, produced its effects by stimulating the\r\nstomach into more powerful action; and that the equality of the motions of\r\nthe heart was thus restored by increasing the excitement of the sensorial\r\npower of association. See Sect. XXV. 17. Class IV. 2. 1. 18.\r\n\r\n10. Where arsenic has been given as a poison, it may be discovered in the\r\ncontents of the stomach by the smell like garlic, when a few grains of it\r\nare thrown on a red-hot iron. 2. If a few grains are placed between two\r\nplates of copper, and subjected to a red heat, the copper becomes whitened.\r\n3. Dissolve arsenic in water along with vegetable alcali, add to this a\r\nsolution of blue vitriol in water, and the mixture becomes of a fine green,\r\nwhich gradually precipitates, as discovered by Bergman. 4. Where the\r\nquantity is sufficient, some wheat may be steeped in a solution of it,\r\nwhich given to sparrows or chickens will destroy them.\r\n\r\nVII. Absorption of the matter from venereal ulcers. No ulcer can heal,\r\nunless the absorption from it is as great as the deposition in it. The\r\npreparations or oxydes of mercury in the cure of the venereal disease seem\r\nto act by their increasing the absorption of the matter in the ulcers it\r\noccasions; and that whether they are taken into the stomach, or applied on\r\nthe skin, or on the surface of the ulcers. And this in the same manner as\r\nsugar of lead, or other metallic oxydes, promote so rapidly the healing of\r\nother ulcers by their external application; and probably when taken\r\ninternally, as rust of iron given to children affected with scrophulous\r\nulcers contributes to heal them, and solutions of lead were once famous in\r\nphthisis.\r\n\r\nThe matter deposited in large abscesses does not occasion hectic fever,\r\ntill it has become oxygenated by being exposed to the open air, or to the\r\nair through a moist membrane; the same seems to happen to other kinds of\r\nmatter, which produce fever, or which occasion spreading ulcers, and are\r\nthence termed contagious. See Class II. 1. 3. II. 1. 5. II. 1. 6. 6. This\r\nmay perhaps occur from these matters not being generally absorbed, till\r\nthey become oxygenated; and that it is the stimulus of the acid thus formed\r\nby their union with oxygen, which occasions their absorption into the\r\ncirculation, and the fever, which they then produce. For though collections\r\nof matter, and milk, and mucus, are sometimes suddenly absorbed during the\r\naction of emetics or in sea-sickness, they are probably eliminated from the\r\nbody without entering the circulation; that is, they are taken up by the\r\nincreased action of one lymphatic branch, and evacuated by the inverted\r\naction of some other lymphatic branch, and thus carried off by stool or\r\nurine.\r\n\r\nBut as the matter in large abscesses is in general not absorbed, till it\r\nbecomes by some means exposed to air, there is reason to conclude, that the\r\nstimulus of this new combination of the matter with oxygen occasions its\r\nabsorption; and that hence the absorption of matter in ulcers of all kinds,\r\nis still more powerfully effected by the external application or internal\r\nuse of metallic oxydes; which are also acids consisting of the metal united\r\nwith oxygen; and lastly, because venereal ulcers, and those of itch, and\r\ntinea, will not heal without some stimulant application; that is, the\r\nsecretion of matter in them continues to be greater, than the absorption of\r\nit; and the ulcers at the same time continue to enlarge, by the contagion\r\naffecting the edges of them; that is, by the stimulus of the oxygenated\r\nmatter stimulating the capillary vessels in its vicinity into actions\r\nsimilar to those of the ulcer, which produces it.\r\n\r\nThis effect of the oxydes of mercury occurs, whether salivation attends its\r\nuse or not. Salivation is much forwarded by external warmth, when mercury\r\nis given to promote this secretion; but as the cure of venereal complaints\r\ndepends on its absorbent quality, the act of salivation is not necessary or\r\nuseful. A quarter of a grain of good corrosive sublimate twice a day will\r\nseldom fail of curing the most confirmed pox; and will as seldom salivate,\r\nif the patient be kept cool. A quarter of a grain thrice a day I believe to\r\nbe infallible, if it be good sublimate.\r\n\r\nMercury alone when swallowed does not act beyond the intestines, its active\r\npreparations are the salts formed by its union with the various acids, as\r\nmentioned in the catalogue. Its union with the vegetable acid, when\r\ntriturated with manna, is said to compose Keyser's Pill. Triturated with\r\ngum arabic it is much recommended by Plenk; and triturated with sugar and a\r\nlittle essential oil, as directed in a former Edinburgh Dispensatory, it\r\nprobably forms some of the syrups sold as nostrums.\r\n\r\nUnited with sulphur it seldom enters the circulation, as when cinnabar, or\r\nÆthiop's mineral, are taken inwardly. But united with fat and rubbed on the\r\nskin, it is readily absorbed. I know not whether it can be united to\r\ncharcoal, nor whether it has been given internally when united with animal\r\nfat.\r\n\r\nVIII. 1. Absorptions in general are increased by inanition; hence the use\r\nof evacuations in the cure of ulcers. Dr. Jurin absorbed in one night,\r\nafter a day's abstinence and exercise, eighteen ounces from the atmosphere\r\nin his chamber; and every one must have observed, how soon his sheets\r\nbecame dry, after having been moistened by sweat, if he throws off part of\r\nthe bed-clothes to cool himself; which is owing to the increased cutaneous\r\nabsorption after the evacuation by previous sweat.\r\n\r\n2. Now as opium is an universal stimulant, as explained in the article on\r\nIncitantia, it must stimulate into increased action both the secretory\r\nsystem, and the absorbent one; but after repeated evacuation by\r\nvenesection, and cathartics, the absorbent system is already inclined to\r\nact more powerfully; as the blood-vessels being less distended, there is\r\nless resistance to the progress of the absorbed fluids into them. Hence\r\nafter evacuations opium promotes absorption, if given in small doses, much\r\nmore than it promotes secretion; and is thus eminently of service at the\r\nend of inflammations, as in pleurisy, or peripneumony, in the dose of four\r\nor five drops of the tincture, given before the access of the evening\r\nparoxysm; which I have seen succeed even when the risus sardonicus has\r\nexisted. Some convulsions may originate in the want of the absorption of\r\nsome acrid secretion, which occasions pain; hence these diseases are so\r\nmuch more certainly relieved by opium after venesection or other\r\nevacuations.\r\n\r\nIX. 1. Absorption is increased by the calces or solutions of mercury, lead,\r\nzinc, copper, iron, externally applied; and by arsenic, and by sulphur, and\r\nby the application of bitter vegetables in fine powder. Thus an ointment\r\nconsisting of mercury and hog's fat rubbed on the skin cures venereal\r\nulcers; and many kinds of herpetic eruptions are removed by an ointment\r\nconsisting of 60 grains of white precipitate of mercury and an ounce of\r\nhog's fat.\r\n\r\n2. The tumours about the necks of young people are often produced by the\r\nabsorption of a saline or acrid material, which has been deposited from\r\neruptions behind the ears, owing to deficient absorption in the surface of\r\nthe ulcer, but which on running down on the skin below becomes absorbed,\r\nand swells the lymphatic glands of the neck; as the variolous matter, when\r\ninserted into the arm, swells the gland of the axilla. Sometimes the\r\nperspirative matter produced behind the ears becomes putrid from the want\r\nof daily washing them, and may also cause by its absorption the tumours of\r\nthe lymphatics of the neck. In the former case the application of a cerate\r\nof lapis calaminaris, or of cerussa applied in dry powder, or of rags\r\ndipped in a solution of sugar of lead, increases the absorption in the\r\nulcers, and prevents the effusion of the saline part of the secreted\r\nmaterial. The latter is to be prevented by cleanliness.\r\n\r\nAfter the eruptions or ulcers are healed a solution of corrosive sublimate\r\nof one grain to an ounce of water applied for some weeks behind the ear,\r\nand amongst the roots of the hair on one side of the head, where the mouths\r\nof the lymphatics of the neck open themselves, frequently removes these\r\ntumours.\r\n\r\n3. Linen rags moistened with a solution of half an ounce of sugar of lead\r\nto a pint of water applied on the erysipelas on anasarcous legs, which have\r\na tendency to mortification, is more efficacious than other applications.\r\nWhite vitriol six grains dissolved in one ounce of rose-water removes\r\ninflammations of the eyes after evacuation more certainly than solutions of\r\nlead. Blue vitriol two or three grains dissolved in an ounce of water cures\r\nulcers in the mouth, and other mucous membranes, and a solution of arsenic\r\nexternally applied cures the itch, but requires great caution in the use of\r\nit. See Class II. 1. 5. 6.\r\n\r\n4. Bitter vegetables, as the Peruvian bark, quilted between two shirts, or\r\nstrewed in their beds, will cure the ague in children sometimes. Iron in\r\nsolution, and some bitter extract, as in the form of ink, will cure one\r\nkind of herpes called the ringworm. And I have seen seven parts of bark in\r\nfine powder mixed with one part of ceruss, or white lead, in fine powder,\r\napplied dry to scrophulous ulcers, and renewed daily, with great advantage.\r\n\r\n5. To these should be added electric sparks and shocks, which promote the\r\nabsorption of the vessels in inflamed eyes of scrophulous children; and\r\ndisperse, or bring to suppuration, scrophulous tumours about the neck. For\r\nthis last purpose smart shocks should be passed through the tumours only,\r\nby inclosing them between two brass knobs communicating with the external\r\nand internal coating of a charged phial. See Art. II. 2. 2. 2.\r\n\r\nX. 1. Bandages increase absorption, if they are made to fit nicely on the\r\npart; for which purpose it is necessary to spread some moderately adhesive\r\nplaster on the bandage, and to cut it into tails, or into shreds two inches\r\nwide; the ends are to be wrapped over each other; and it must be applied\r\nwhen the part is least tumid, as in the morning before the patient rises,\r\nif on the lower extremities. The emplastrum de minio made to cover the\r\nwhole of a swelled leg in this manner, whether the swelling is hard, which\r\nis usually termed scorbutic; or more easily compressible, as in anasarca,\r\nreduces the limb in two or three days to its natural size; for this purpose\r\nI have sometimes used carpenter's glue, mixed with one twentieth part of\r\nhoney to prevent its becoming too hard, instead of a resinous plaster; but\r\nthe minium plaster of the shops is in general to be preferred. Nothing so\r\nmuch facilitates the cure of ulcers in the legs, as covering the whole limb\r\nfrom the toes to the knee with such a plaster-bandage; which increases the\r\npower of absorption in the surface of the sore.\r\n\r\n2. The lymph is carried along the absorbent vessels, which are replete with\r\nvalves, by the intermitted pressure of the arteries in their neighbourhood.\r\nNow if the external skin of the limb be lax, it rises, and gives way to the\r\npressure of the arteries at every pulsation; and thence the lymphatic\r\nvessels are subject to the pressure of but half the arterial force. But\r\nwhen the external skin is tightened by the surrounding bandage, and thence\r\nis not elevated by the arterial diastole, the whole of this power is\r\nexerted in compressing the lymphatic vessels, and carrying on the lymph\r\nalready absorbed; and thence the absorbent power is so amazingly increased\r\nby bandage nicely applied. Pains are sometimes left in the fleshy parts of\r\nthe thighs or arms, after the inflammation is gone, in the acute\r\nrheumatism, or after the patient is too weak for further evacuation; in\r\nthis case after internal absorbent medicines, as the bark, and opiates,\r\nhave been used in vain, I have successfully applied a plaster-bandage, as\r\nabove described, so as to compress the pained part.\r\n\r\nXI. 1. We shall conclude by observing, that the sorbentia strengthen the\r\nwhole habit by preventing the escape of the fluid part of the secretions\r\nout of the body, before it has given up as much nourishment, as it is\r\ncapable; as the liquid part of the secretion of urine, sweat, saliva, and\r\nof all other secretions, which are poured into receptacles. Hence they have\r\nbeen said to brace the body, and been called tonics, which are mechanical\r\nterms not applicable to the living bodies of animals; as explained in Sect.\r\nXXXII. 3. 2.\r\n\r\n2. A continued use of bitter medicines for years together, as of Portland's\r\npowder, or of the bark, is supposed to induce apoplexy, or other fatal\r\ndiseases. Two cases of this kind have fallen under my observation; the\r\npatients were both rather intemperate in respect to the use of fermented\r\nliquors, and one of them had been previously subject to the gout. As I\r\nbelieve the gout generally originates from a torpor of the liver, which\r\ninstead of being succeeded by an inflammation of it, is succeeded by an\r\ninflammation of some of the joints; or by a pimpled face, which is another\r\nmode, by which the disease of the liver is terminated. I conceive, that the\r\ndaily use of bitter medicine had in these patients prevented the removal of\r\na gouty inflammation from the liver to the membranes of the joints of the\r\nextremities, or to the skin of the face, by preventing the necessary torpor\r\nof these parts previous to the inflammation of them; in the same manner as\r\ncold fits of fever are prevented by the same medicines; and, as I believe,\r\nthe returns of the gout have sometimes for two or three years been\r\nprevented by them.\r\n\r\nOne of these patients died of the apoplexy in a few hours; and the other of\r\nan inflammation of the liver, which I believe was called the gout, and in\r\nconsequence was not treated by venesection, and other evacuations. From\r\nhence it appears, that the daily use of hop in our malt liquor must add to\r\nthe noxious quality of the spirit in it, when taken to excess, and\r\ncontribute to the production of apoplexy, or inflammation of the liver.\r\n\r\nIII.

Those things, which invert the natural order of the successive\r\nirritative motions, are termed invertentia.\r\n\r\n1. Emetics invert the motions of the stomach, duodenum, and oesophagus.\r\n\r\n2. Violent cathartics invert the motions of the lacteals, and intestinal\r\nlymphatics.\r\n\r\n3. Violent errhines invert the nasal lymphatics, and those of the frontal\r\nand maxillary sinuses. And medicines producing nausea, invert the motions\r\nof the lymphatics about the sauces.\r\n\r\n4. Medicines producing much pale urine, as a certain quantity of alcohol,\r\ninvert the motions of the urinary absorbents; if the dose of alcohol is\r\ngreater, it inverts the stomach, producing the drunken sickness.\r\n\r\n5. Medicines producing cold sweats, palpitation of the heart, globus\r\nhystericus; as violent evacuations, some poisons, fear, anxiety, act by\r\ninverting the natural order of the vascular motions.\r\n\r\nII. OBSERVATIONS ON THE INVERTENTIA.\r\n\r\nI. 1. The action of vomiting seems originally to have been occasioned by\r\ndisagreeable sensation from the distention or acrimony of the aliment; in\r\nthe same manner as when any disgustful material is taken into the mouth, as\r\na bitter drug, and is rejected by the retrograde motions of the tongue and\r\nlips; as explained in Class IV. 1. 1. 2. and mentioned in Sect. XXXV. 1. 3.\r\nOr the disagreeable sensation may thus excite the power of volition, which\r\nmay also contribute to the retrograde actions of the stomach and\r\noesophagus, as when cows bring up the contents of their first stomach to\r\nre-masticate it. To either of these is to be attributed the action of mild\r\nemetics, which soon cease to operate, and leave the stomach stronger, or\r\nmore irritable, after their operation; owing to the accumulation of the\r\nsensorial power of irritation during its torpid or inverted action. Such\r\nappears to be the operation of ipecacuanha, or of antimonium tartarizatum,\r\nin small doses.\r\n\r\n2. But there is reason to believe, that the stronger emetics, as digitalis,\r\nfirst stimulate the absorbent vessels of the stomach into greater action;\r\nand that the inverted motions of these absorbents next occur, pouring the\r\nlymph, lately taken up, or obtained from other lymphatic branches, into the\r\nstomach: the quantity of which in some diseases, as in the cholera morbus,\r\nis inconceivable. This inverted motion, first of the absorbents of the\r\nstomach, and afterwards of the stomach itself, seems to originate from the\r\nexhaustion or debility, which succeeds the unnatural degree of action, into\r\nwhich they had been previously stimulated. An unusual defect of stimulus,\r\nas of food without spice or wine in the stomachs of those, who have been\r\nmuch accustomed to spice or wine, will induce sickness or vomiting; in this\r\ncase the defective energy of the stomach is owing to defect of accustomed\r\nstimulus; while the action of vomiting from digitalis is owing to a\r\ndeficiency of sensorial power, which is previously exhausted by the excess\r\nof its stimulus. See Sect. XXXV. 1. 3. and Class IV. 1. 1. 2.\r\n\r\nFor first, no increase of heat arises from this action of vomiting; which\r\nalways occurs, when the secerning system is stimulated into action.\r\nSecondly, the motions of the absorbent vessels are as liable to inversion\r\nas the stomach itself; which last, with the oesophagus, may be considered\r\nas the absorbent mouth and belly of that great gland, the intestinal canal.\r\nThirdly, the class of sorbentia, as bitters and metallic salts, given in\r\nlarge doses, become invertentia, and vomit, or purge. And lastly, the\r\nsickness and vomiting induced by large potations of wine, or opium, does\r\nnot occur till next day in some people, in none till some time after their\r\ningurgitation. And tincture of digitalis in the dose of 30 or 60 drops,\r\nthough applied in solution, is a considerable time before it produces its\r\neffect; though vomiting is instantaneously induced by a nauseous idea, or a\r\nnauseous taste in the mouth. At the same time there seem to be some\r\nmaterials, which can immediately stimulate the stomach into such powerful\r\naction, as to be immediately succeeded by paralysis of it, and consequent\r\ncontinued fever, or immediate death; and this without exciting sensation,\r\nthat is, without our perceiving it. Of these are the contagious matter of\r\nsome fevers swallowed with the saliva, and probably a few grains of arsenic\r\ntaken in solution. See Suppl. I. 8. 8. Art. IV. 2. 6. 9.\r\n\r\n3. Some branches of the lymphatic system become inverted by their sympathy\r\nwith other branches, which are only stimulated into too violent absorption.\r\nThus when the stomach and duodenum are much stimulated by alcohol, by\r\nnitre, or by worms, in some persons the urinary lymphatics have their\r\nmotion inverted, and pour that material into the bladder, which is absorbed\r\nfrom the intestines. Hence the drunken diabetes is produced; and hence\r\nchyle is seen in the urine in worm cases.\r\n\r\nWhen on the contrary some branches of the absorbent systems have their\r\nmotions inverted in consequence of the previous exhaustion of their\r\nsensorial power by any violent stimulus, other branches of it have their\r\nabsorbent power greatly increased. Hence continued vomiting, or violent\r\ncathartics, produce great absorption from the cellular membrane in cases of\r\ndropsy; and the fluids thus absorbed are poured into the stomach and\r\nintestines by the inverted motions of the lacteals and lymphatics. See\r\nSect. XXIX. 4. and 5.\r\n\r\n4. The quantity of the dose of an emetic is not of so great consequence as\r\nof other medicines, as the greatest part of it is rejected with the first\r\neffort. All emetics are said to act with greater certainty when given in a\r\nmorning, if an opiate had been given the night before. For the sensorial\r\npower of irritation of the stomach had thus been in some measure previously\r\nexhausted by the stimulus of the opium, which thus facilitates the action\r\nof the emetic; and which, when the dose of opium has been large, is\r\nfrequently followed on the next day by spontaneous sickness and vomitings,\r\nas after violent intoxication.\r\n\r\nIpecacuanha is the most certain in its effect from five grains to thirty;\r\nwhite vitriol is the most expeditious in its effect, from twenty grains to\r\nthirty dissolved in warm water; but emetic tartar, antimonium tartarizatum,\r\nfrom one grain to four to sane people, and from thence to twenty to insane\r\npatients, will answer most of the useful purposes of emetics; but nothing\r\nequals the digitalis purpurea for the purpose of absorbing water from the\r\ncellular membrane in the anasarca pulmonum, or hydrops pectoris. See Art.\r\nIV. 2. 3. 7.\r\n\r\nII. Violent cathartics. 1. Where violent cathartics are required, as in\r\ndropsies, the squill in dried powder made into small pills of a grain, or a\r\ngrain and a half, one to be given every hour till they operate briskly, is\r\nvery efficacious; or half a grain of emetic tartar dissolved in an ounce of\r\npeppermint-water, and given every hour, till it operates. Scammony, and\r\nother strong purges, are liable to produce hypercatharsis, if they are not\r\nnicely prepared, and accurately weighed, and are thence dangerous in common\r\npractice. Gamboge is uncertain in its effects, it has otherwise the good\r\nproperty of being tasteless; and on that account some preparation of it\r\nmight be useful for children, by which its dose could be ascertained, and\r\nits effects rendered more uniform.\r\n\r\n2. In inflammations of the bowels with constipation calomel, given in the\r\ndose from ten to twenty grains after due venesection, is most efficacious;\r\nand if made into very small pills is not liable to be rejected by vomiting,\r\nwhich generally attends those cases. When this fails, a grain of aloes\r\nevery hour will find its way, if the bowel is not destroyed; and sometimes,\r\nI believe, if it be, when the mortification is not extensive. If the\r\nvomiting continues after the pain ceases, and especially if the bowels\r\nbecome tumid with air, which sounds on being struck with the finger, these\r\npatients seldom recover. Opiates given along with the cathartics I believe\r\nto be frequently injurious in inflammation of the bowels, though they may\r\nthus be given with advantage in the saturnine colic; the pain and\r\nconstipation in which disease are owing to torpor or inactivity, and not to\r\ntoo great action.\r\n\r\nIII. Violent errhines and sialagogues. 1. Turpeth mineral in the quantity\r\nof one grain mixed with ten grains of sugar answers every purpose to be\r\nexpected from errhines. Their operation is by inverting the motions of the\r\nlymphatics of the membrane, which lines the nostrils, and the caverns of\r\nthe forehead and cheeks; and may thence possibly be of service in the\r\nhydrocephalus internus.\r\n\r\nSome other violent errhines, as the powder of white hellebore, or Cayan\r\npepper, diluted with some less acrid powder, are said to cure some cold or\r\nnervous head-achs; which may be effected by inflaming the nostrils, and\r\nthus introducing the sensorial power of sensation, as well as increasing\r\nthat of irritation; and thus to produce violent action of the membranes of\r\nthe nostrils, and of the frontal and maxillary sinuses, which may by\r\nassociation excite into action the torpid membranes, which occasion the\r\nhead-ach.\r\n\r\n2. A copious salivation without any increase of heat often attends hysteric\r\ndiseases, and fevers with debility, owing to an inversion of the lymphatics\r\nof the mouth, see Class I. 1. 2. 6. The same occurs in the nausea, which\r\nprecedes vomiting; and is also excitable by disagreeable tastes, as by\r\nsquills, or by nauseous smells, or by nauseous ideas. These are very\r\nsimilar to the occasional discharge of a thin fluid from the nostrils of\r\nsome people, which recurs at certain periods, and differs from defective\r\nabsorption.\r\n\r\nIV. Violent diuretics. 1. If nitre be given from a dram to half an ounce in\r\na morning at repeated draughts, the patient becomes sickish, and much pale\r\nwater is thrown into the bladder by the inverted action of the urinary\r\nlymphatics. Hence the absorption in ulcers is increased and the cure\r\nforwarded, as observed by Dr. Rowley.\r\n\r\n2. Cantharides taken inwardly so stimulate the neck of the bladder as to\r\nincrease the discharge of mucus, which appears in the urine; but I once saw\r\na large dose taken by mistake, not less than half an ounce or an ounce of\r\nthe tincture, by which I suppose the urinary lymphatics were thrown into\r\nviolent inverted motions, for the patient drank repeated draughts of\r\nsubtepid water to the quantity of a gallon or two in a few hours; and\r\nduring the greatest part of that time he was not I believe two entire\r\nminutes together without making water. A little blood was seen in his water\r\nthe next day, and a soreness continued a day longer without any other\r\ninconvenience.\r\n\r\n3. The decoction of foxglove should also be mentioned here, as great\r\neffusions of urine frequently follow its exhibition. See Art. IV. 2. 3. 7.\r\nAnd an infusion or tincture of tobacco as recommended by Dr. Fowler of\r\nYork.\r\n\r\n4. Alcohol, and opium, if taken so as to induce slight intoxication, and\r\nthe body be kept cool, and much diluting liquids taken along with them,\r\nhave similar effect in producing for a time a greater flow of urine, as\r\nmost intemperate drinkers must occasionally have observed. This\r\ncircumstance seems to have introduced the use of gin, and other vinous\r\nspirits as a diuretic, unfortunately in the gravel, amongst ignorant\r\npeople; which disease is generally produced by fermented or spirituous\r\nliquors, and always increased by them.\r\n\r\n5. Fear and anxiety are well known to produce a great frequency of making\r\nwater. A person, who believed he had made a bad purchase concerning an\r\nestate, told me, that he made five or six pints of water during a sleepless\r\nnight, which succeeded his bargain; and it is usual, where young men are\r\nwaiting in an anti-room to be examined for college preferment, to see the\r\nchamber-pot often wanted.\r\n\r\nV. Cold sweats about the head, neck, and arms, frequently attend those,\r\nwhose lungs are oppressed, as in some dropsies and asthma. A cold sweat is\r\nalso frequently the harbinger of death. These are from the inverted motions\r\nof the cutaneous lymphatic branches of those parts.\r\n\r\nIII. CATALOGUE OF INVERTENTIA.\r\n\r\nI.

Those things, which restore the natural order of the inverted irritative\r\nmotions, are termed Revertentia.\r\n\r\n1. As musk, castor, asafoetida, valerian, essential oils.\r\n\r\n2. Externally the vapour of burnt feathers, of volatile salts, or oils,\r\nblisters, sinapisms.\r\n\r\nThese reclaim the inverted motions without increasing the heat of the body\r\nabove its natural state, if given in their proper doses, as in the globus\r\nhystericus, and palpitation of the heart.\r\n\r\nThe incitantia revert these morbid motions more certainly, as opium and\r\nalcohol; and restore the natural heat more; but if they induce any degree\r\nof intoxication, they are succeeded by debility, when their stimulus\r\nceases.\r\n\r\nII. OBSERVATIONS ON THE REVERTENTIA.\r\n\r\nI. The hysteric disease is attended with inverted motions feebly exerted of\r\nthe oesophagus, intestinal canal and lymphatics of the bladder. Hence the\r\nborborigmi, or rumbling of the bowels, owing to their fluid contents\r\ndescending as the air beneath ascends. The globus hystericus consists in\r\nthe retrograde motion of the oesophagus, and the great flow of urine from\r\nthat of the lymphatics spread on the neck of the bladder; and a copious\r\nsalivation sometimes happens to these patients from the inversion of the\r\nlymphatics of the mouth; and palpitation of the heart owing to weak or\r\nincipient inversion of its motions; and syncope, when this occurs in its\r\ngreatest degree.\r\n\r\nThese hysteric affections are not necessarily attended with pain; though it\r\nsometimes happens, that pains, which originate from quiescence, afflict\r\nthese patients, as the hemicrania, which has erroneously been termed the\r\nclavus hystericus; but which is owing solely to the inaction of the\r\nmembranes of that part, like the pains attending the cold fits of\r\nintermittents, and which frequently returns like them at very regular\r\nperiods of time.\r\n\r\nMany of the above symptoms are relieved by musk, castor, the foetid gums,\r\nvalerian, oleum animale, oil of amber, which act in the usual dose without\r\nheating the body. The pains, which sometimes attend these constitutions,\r\nare relieved by the secernentia, as essential oils in common tooth-ach, and\r\nbalsam of Peru in the flatulent colic. But the incitantia, as opium, or\r\nvinous spirit, reclaim these morbid inverted motions with more certainty,\r\nthan the foetids; and remove the pains, which attend these constitutions,\r\nwith more certainty than the secernentia; but if given in large doses, a\r\ndebility and return of the hysteric symptoms occurs, when the effect of the\r\nopium or alcohol ceases. Opiates and foetids joined seem best to answer the\r\npurpose of alleviating the present symptoms; and the sorbentia, by\r\nstimulating the lymphatics and lacteals into continued action, prevent a\r\nrelapse of their inversion, as Peruvian bark, and rust of iron. See Class\r\nI. 3. 1. 10.\r\n\r\nII. Vomiting consists in the inverted order of the motions of the stomach,\r\nand oesophagus; and is also attended with the inverted motions of a part of\r\nthe duodenum, when bile is ejected; and of the lymphatics of the stomach\r\nand fauces, when nausea attends, and when much lymph is evacuated.\r\nPermanent vomiting is for a time relieved by the incitantia, as opium or\r\nalcohol; but is liable to return, when their action ceases. A blister on\r\nthe back, or on the stomach, is more efficacious for restraining vomiting\r\nby their stimulating into action the external skin, and by sympathy\r\naffecting the membranes of the stomach. In some fevers attended with\r\nincessant vomiting Sydenham advised the patient to put his head under the\r\nbed-clothes, till a sweat appeared on the skin, as explained in Class IV.\r\n1. 1. 2.\r\n\r\nIn chronical vomiting I have observed crude mercury of good effect in the\r\ndose of half an ounce twice a day. The vomitings, or vain efforts to vomit,\r\nwhich sometimes attend hysteric or epileptic patients, are frequently\r\ninstantly relieved for a time by applying flour of mustard-seed and water\r\nto the small of the leg; and removing it, as soon as the pain becomes\r\nconsiderable. If sinapisms lie on too long, especially in paralytic cases,\r\nthey are liable to produce troublesome ulcers. A plaster or cataplasm, with\r\nopium and camphor on the region of the stomach, will sometimes revert its\r\nretrograde motions.\r\n\r\nIII. Violent catharsis, as in diarrhoea or dysentery, is attended with\r\ninverted motions of the lymphatics of the intestines, and is generally\r\nowing to some stimulating material. This is counteracted by plenty of\r\nmucilaginous liquids, as solutions of gum arabic, or small chicken broth,\r\nto wash away or dilute the stimulating material, which causes the disease.\r\nAnd then by the use of the intestinal sorbentia, Art. IV. 2. 5. as rhubarb,\r\ndecoction of logwood, calcined hartshorn, Armenian bole; and lastly, by the\r\nincitantia, as opium.\r\n\r\nIV. The diabætes consists in the inverted motions of the urinary\r\nlymphatics, which is generally I suppose owing to the too great action of\r\nsome other branch of the absorbent system. The urinary branch should be\r\nstimulated by cantharides, turpentine, resin (which when taken in larger\r\ndoses may possibly excite it into inverted action), by the sorbentia and\r\nopium. The intestinal lymphatics should be rendered less active by\r\ntorpentia, as calcareous earth, earth of alum; and those of the skin by oil\r\nexternally applied over the whole body; and by the warm-bath, which should\r\nbe of 96 or 98 degrees of heat, and the patient should sit in it every day\r\nfor half an hour.\r\n\r\nV. Inverted motions of the intestinal canal with all the lymphatics, which\r\nopen into it, constitute the ileus, or iliac passion; in which disease it\r\nsometimes happens, that clysters are returned by the mouth. After\r\nvenesection from ten grains to twenty of calomel made into very small\r\npills; if this is rejected, a grain of aloe every hour; a blister; crude\r\nmercury; warm-bath; if a clyster of iced water?\r\n\r\nMany other inverted motions of different parts of the system are described\r\nin Class I. 3. and which are to be treated in a manner similar to those\r\nabove described. It must be noted, that the medicines mentioned under\r\nnumber one in the catalogue of revertentia are the true articles belonging\r\nto this class of medicines. Those enumerated in the other four divisions\r\nare chiefly such things as tend to remove the stimulating causes, which\r\nhave induced the inversion of the motions of the part, as acrimonious\r\ncontents, or inflammation, of the bowels in diarrhoea, diabetes, or in\r\nileus. But it is probable after these remote causes are destroyed, that the\r\nfetid gums, musk, castor, and balsams, might be given with advantage in all\r\nthese cases.\r\n\r\nIII. CATALOGUE OF REVERTENTIA.\r\n\r\nI. Inverted motions, which attend the hysteric disease, are reclaimed, 1.\r\nBy musk, castor. 2. By asafoetida, galbanum, sagapænum, ammoniacum,\r\nvalerian. 3. Essential oils of cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, infusion of\r\npenny-royal, mentha, pulegium, peppermint, mentha piperita, ether, camphor.\r\n4. Spirit of hartshorn, oleum animale, spunge burnt to charcoal,\r\nblack-snuffs of candles, which consist principally of animal charcoal,\r\nwood-soot, oil of amber. 5. The incitantia, as opium, alcohol, vinegar. 6.\r\nExternally the smoke of burnt feathers, oil of amber, volatile salt applied\r\nto the nostrils, blisters, sinapisms.\r\n\r\nII. Inverted motions of the stomach are reclaimed by opium, alcohol,\r\nblisters, crude mercury, sinapisms, camphor and opium externally, clysters\r\nwith asafoetida.\r\n\r\nIII. Inverted motions of the intestinal lymphatics are reclaimed by\r\nmucilaginous diluents, and by intestinal sorbentia, as rhubarb, logwood,\r\ncalcined hartshorn, Armenian bole; and lastly by incitantia, as opium.\r\n\r\nIV. Inverted motions of the urinary lymphatics are reclaimed by\r\ncantharides, turpentine, rosin, the sorbentia, and opium, with calcareous\r\nearth, and earth of alum, by oil externally, warm-bath.\r\n\r\nV. Inverted motions of the intestinal canal are reclaimed by calomel, aloe,\r\ncrude mercury, blisters, warm-bath, clysters with asafoetida, clysters of\r\niced water? or of spring water further cooled by salt dissolved in water\r\ncontained in an exterior vessel? Where there exists an introsusception of\r\nthe bowel in children, could the patient be held up for a time by the feet\r\nwith his head downwards, or be laid with his body on an inclined plane with\r\nhis head downwards, and crude mercury be injected as a clyster to the\r\nquantity of two or three pounds?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nART. VII.\r\n\r\nTORPENTIA.\r\n\r\nI. Those things, which diminish the exertion of the irritative motions, are\r\ntermed torpentia.\r\n\r\n1. As mucus, mucilage, water, bland oils, and whatever possesses less\r\nstimulus than our usual food. Diminution of heat, light, sound, oxygen, and\r\nof all other stimuli; venesection, nausea, and anxiety.\r\n\r\n2. Those things which chemically destroy acrimony, as calcareous earth,\r\nsoap, tin, alcalies, in cardialgia; or which prevent chemical acrimony, as\r\nacid of vitriol in cardialgia, which prevents the fermentation of the\r\naliment in the stomach, and its consequent acidity. Secondly, which destroy\r\nworms, as calomel, iron filings or rust of iron, in the round worms; or\r\namalgama of quicksilver and tin, or tin in very large doses, in the\r\ntape-worms. Will ether in clysters destroy ascarides? Thirdly, by\r\nchemically destroying extraneous bodies, as caustic alcali, lime, mild\r\nalcali in the stone. Fourthly, those things which lubricate the vessels,\r\nalong which extraneous bodies slide, as oil in the stone in the urethra,\r\nand to expedite the expectoration of hardened mucus; or which lessen the\r\nfriction of the contents in the intestinal canal in dysentery or aphtha, as\r\ncalcined hartshorn, clay, Armenian bole, chalk, bone-ashes. Fifthly, such\r\nthings as soften or extend the cuticle over tumors, or phlegmons, as warm\r\nwater, poultices, fomentations, or by confining the perspirable matter on\r\nthe part by cabbage-leaves, oil, fat, bee's-wax, plasters, oiled silk,\r\nexternally applied.\r\n\r\nThese decrease the natural heat and remove pains occasioned by excess of\r\nirritative motions.\r\n\r\nII. OBSERVATIONS ON THE TORPENTIA.\r\n\r\nI. As the torpentia consist of such materials as are less stimulating than\r\nour usual diet, it is evident, that where this class of medicines is used,\r\nsome regard must be had to the usual manner of living of the patient both\r\nin respect to quantity and quality. Hence wounds in those, who have been\r\naccustomed to the use of much wine, are very liable to mortify, unless the\r\nusual potation of wine be allowed the patient. And in these habits I have\r\nseen a delirium in a fever cured almost immediately by wine; which was\r\noccasioned by the too mild regimen directed by the attendants. On the\r\ncontrary in great inflammation, the subduction of food, and of spirituous\r\ndrink, contributes much to the cure of the disease. As by these means both\r\nthe stimulus from distention of the vessels, as well as that from the\r\nacrimony of the fluids, is decreased; but in both these respects the\r\nprevious habits of diet of the patients must be attended to. Thus if tea be\r\nmade stronger, than the patient has usually drank it, it belongs to the\r\narticle sorbentia; if weaker, it belongs to the torpentia.\r\n\r\nII. Water in a quantity greater than usual diminishes the action of the\r\nsystem not only by diluting our fluids, and thence lessening their\r\nstimulus, but by lubricating the solids; for not only the parts of our\r\nsolids have their sliding over each other facilitated by the interposition\r\nof aqueous particles; but the particles of mucaginous or saccharine\r\nsolutions slide easier over each other by being mixed with a greater\r\nportion of water, and thence stimulate the vessels less.\r\n\r\nAt the same time it must be observed, that the particles of water\r\nthemselves, and of animal gluten dissolved in water, as the glue used by\r\ncarpenters, slide easier over each other by an additional quantity of the\r\nfluid matter of heat.\r\n\r\nThese two fluids of heat and of water may be esteemed the universal\r\nsolvents or lubricants in respect to animal bodies, and thus facilitate the\r\ncirculation, and the secretion of the various glands. At the same time it\r\nis possible, that these two fluids may occasionally assume an aerial form,\r\nas in the cavity of the chest, and by compressing the lungs may cause one\r\nkind of asthma, which is relieved by breathing colder air. An increased\r\nquantity of heat by adding stimulus to every part of the system belongs to\r\nthe article Incitantia.\r\n\r\nIII. 1. The application of cold to the skin, which is only another\r\nexpression for the diminution of the degree of heat we are accustomed to,\r\nbenumbs the cutaneous absorbents into inaction; and by sympathy the urinary\r\nand intestinal absorbents become also quiescent. The secerning vessels\r\ncontinuing their action somewhat longer, from the warmth of the blood.\r\nHence the usual secretions are poured into the bladder and intestines, and\r\nno absorption is retaken from them. Hence sprinkling the skin with cold\r\nwater increases the quantity of urine, which is pale; and of stool, which\r\nis fluid; these have erroneously been ascribed to increased secretion, or\r\nto obstructed perspiration.\r\n\r\nThe thin discharge from the nostrils of some people in cold weather is\r\nowing to the torpid state of the absorbent vessels of the membrana\r\nsneideriana, which as above are benumbed sooner than those, which perform\r\nthe secretion of the mucus.\r\n\r\nThe quick anhelation, and palpitation of the heart, of those, who are\r\nimmersed in cold water, depends on the quiescence of the external absorbent\r\nvessels and capillaries. Hence the cutaneous circulation is diminished, and\r\nby association an almost universal torpor of the system is induced; thence\r\nthe heart becomes incapable to push forwards its blood through all the\r\ninactive capillaries and glands; and as the terminating vessels of the\r\npulmonary artery suffer a similar inaction by association, the blood is\r\nwith difficulty pushed through the lungs.\r\n\r\nSome have imagined, that a spasmodic constriction of the smaller vessels\r\ntook place, and have thus accounted for their resistance to the force of\r\nthe heart. But there seems no necessity to introduce this imaginary spasm;\r\nsince those, who are conversant in injecting bodies, find it necessary\r\nfirst to put them into warm water to take away the stiffness of the cold\r\ndead vessels; which become inflexible like the other muscles of dead\r\nanimals, and prevent the injected fluid from passing.\r\n\r\nAll the same symptoms occur in the cold fits of intermittents; in these the\r\ncoldness and paleness of the skin with thirst evince the diminution of\r\ncutaneous absorption; and the dryness of ulcers, and small secretion of\r\nurine, evince the torpor of the secerning system; and the anhelation, and\r\ncoldness of the breath, shew the terminations of the pulmonary artery to be\r\nlikewise affected with torpor.\r\n\r\nAfter these vessels of the whole surface of the body both absorbent and\r\nsecretory have been for a time torpid by the application of cold water; and\r\nall the internal secerning and absorbent ones have been made torpid from\r\ntheir association with the external; as soon as their usual stimulus of\r\nwarmth is renewed, they are thrown into more than their usual energy of\r\naction; as the hands become hot and painful on approaching the fire after\r\nhaving been immersed some time in snow. Hence the face becomes of a red\r\ncolour in a cold day on turning from the wind, and the insensible\r\nperspiration increased by repeatedly going into frosty air, but not\r\ncontinuing in it too long at a time.\r\n\r\n2. When by the too great warmth of a room or of clothes, the secretion of\r\nperspirable matter is much increased, the strength of the patient is much\r\nexhausted by this unnecessary exertion of the capillary system, and thence\r\nof the whole secerning and arterial system by association. The diminution\r\nof external heat immediately induces a torpor or quiescence of these\r\nunnecessary exertions, and the patient instantly feels himself\r\nstrengthened, and exhilarated; the animal power, which was thus wasted in\r\nvain, being now applied to more useful purposes. Thus when the limbs on one\r\nside are disabled by a stroke of the palsy, those of the other side are\r\nperpetually in motion. And hence all people bear riding and other exercises\r\nbest in cold weather.\r\n\r\nPatients in fevers, where the skin is hot, are immediately strengthened by\r\ncold air; which is therefore of great use in fevers attended with debility\r\nand heat; but may perhaps be of temporary disservice, if too hastily\r\napplied in some situations of fevers attended with internal topical\r\ninflammation, as in peripneumony or pleurisy, where the arterial strength\r\nis too great already, and the increased action of the external capillaries\r\nbeing destroyed by the cold, the action of the internal inflamed part may\r\nbe suddenly increased, unless venesection and other evacuations are applied\r\nat the same time. Yet in most cases the application of cold is nevertheless\r\nsalutary, as by decreasing the heat of the particles of blood in the\r\ncutaneous vessels, the stimulus of them, and the distention of the vessels\r\nbecomes considerably lessened. In external inflammations, as the small-pox,\r\nand perhaps the gout and rheumatism, the application of cold air must be of\r\ngreat service by decreasing the action of the inflamed skin, though the\r\ncontrary is too frequently the practice in those diseases. It must be\r\nobserved, that for all these purposes the application of it should be\r\ncontinued a long time, otherwise an increased exertion follows the\r\ntemporary torpor, before the disease is destroyed.\r\n\r\n3. After immersion in cold water or in cold air the whole system becomes\r\nmore exciteable by the natural degree of stimulus, as appears from the\r\nsubsequent glow on the skin of people otherwise pale; and even by a degree\r\nof stimulus less than natural, as appears by their becoming warm in a short\r\ntime during their continuance in a bath, of about 80 degrees of heat, as in\r\nBuxton bath. See Sect XII. 2. 1. XXXII. 3. 3.\r\n\r\nThis increased exertion happens to the absorbent vessels more particularly,\r\nas they are first and most affected by these temporary diminutions of heat;\r\nand hence like the medicines, which promote absorption, the cold-bath\r\ncontributes to strengthen the constitution, that is to increase its\r\nirritability; for the diseases attended with weakness, as nervous fevers\r\nand hysteric diseases, are shewn in Section XXXII. 2. 1. to proceed from a\r\nwant of irritability, not from an excess of it. Hence the digestion is\r\ngreater in frosty weather, and the quantity of perspiration. For these\r\npurposes the application of cold must not be continued too long. For in\r\nriding a journey in cold weather, when the feet are long kept too cold, the\r\ndigestion is impaired, and cardialgia produced.\r\n\r\n4. If the diminution of external heat be too great, produced too hastily,\r\nor continued too long, the torpor of the system either becomes so great,\r\nthat the animal ceases to live; or so great an energy of motion or orgasm\r\nof the vessels succeeds, as to produce fever or inflammation. This most\r\nfrequently happens after the body has been temporarily heated by exercise,\r\nwarm rooms, anger, or intemperance. Hence colds are produced in the\r\nexternal air by resting after exercise, or by drinking cold water. See\r\nClass I. 2. 2. 1.\r\n\r\nFrequent cold immersions harden or invigorate the constitution, which they\r\neffect by habituating the body to bear a diminution of heat on its surface\r\nwithout being thrown into such extensive torpor or quiescence by the\r\nconsent of the vessels of the skin with the pulmonary and glandular system;\r\nas those experience, who frequently use the cold-bath. At first they have\r\ngreat anhelation and palpitation of heart at their ingress into cold water;\r\nbut by the habit of a few weeks they are able to bear this diminution of\r\nheat with little or no inconvenience; for the power of volition has some\r\ninfluence over the muscles subservient to respiration, and by its counter\r\nefforts gradually prevents the quick breathing, and diminishes the\r\nassociations of the pulmonary vessels with the cutaneous ones. And thus\r\nthough the same quantity of heat is subducted from the skin, yet the torpor\r\nof the pulmonary vessels and internal glands does not follow. Hence during\r\ncold immersion less sensorial power is accumulated, and in consequence,\r\nless exertion of it succeeds on emerging from the bath. Whence such people\r\nare esteemed hardy, and bear the common variations of atmospheric\r\ntemperature without inconvenience. See Sect. XXXII. 3. 2.\r\n\r\nIV. Venesection has a just title to be classed amongst the torpentia in\r\ncases of fever with arterial strength, known by the fulness and hardness of\r\nthe pulse. In these cases the heat becomes less by its use, and all\r\nexuberant secretions, as of bile or sweat, are diminished, and room is made\r\nin the blood-vessels for the absorption of mild fluids; and hence the\r\nabsorption also of new vessels, or extravasated fluids, the produce of\r\ninflammation, is promoted. Hence venesection is properly classed amongst\r\nthe sorbentia, as like other evacuations it promotes general absorption,\r\nrestrains hæmorrhages, and cures those pains, which originate from the too\r\ngreat action of the secerning vessels, or from the torpor of the\r\nabsorbents. I have more than once been witness to the sudden removal of\r\nnervous head-achs by venesection, though the patient was already exhausted,\r\npale, and feeble; and to its great use in convulsions and madness, whether\r\nthe patient was strong or weak; which diseases are the consequence of\r\nnervous pains; and to its stopping long debilitating hæmorrhages from the\r\nuterus, when other means had been in vain essayed. In inflammatory pains,\r\nand inflammatory hæmorrhages, every one justly applies to it, as the\r\ncertain and only cure.\r\n\r\nV. When the circulation is carried on too violently, as in inflammatory\r\nfevers, those medicines, which invert the motions of some parts of the\r\nsystem, retard the motions of some other parts, which are associated with\r\nthem. Hence small doses of emetic tartar, and ipecacuanha, and large doses\r\nof nitre, by producing nausea debilitate and lessen the energy of the\r\ncirculation, and are thence useful in inflammatory diseases. It must be\r\nadded, that if nitre be swallowed in powder, or soon after it is dissolved,\r\nit contributes to lessen the circulation by the cold it generates, like\r\nice-water, or the external application of cold air.\r\n\r\nVI. The respiration of air mixed with a greater proportion of azote than is\r\nfound in the common atmosphere, or of air mixed with hydrogen, or with\r\ncarbonic acid gas, so that the quantity of oxygen might be less than usual,\r\nwould probably act in cases of inflammation with great advantage. In\r\nconsumptions this might be most conveniently and effectually applied, if a\r\nphthisical patient could reside day and night in a porter or ale brewery,\r\nwhere great quantities of those liquors were perpetually fermenting in vats\r\nor open barrels; or in some great manufactory of wines from raisins or from\r\nsugar.\r\n\r\nExternally the application of carbonic acid gas to cancers and other ulcers\r\ninstead of atmospheric air may prevent their enlargement, by preventing the\r\nunion of oxygen with matter, and thus producing a new contagious animal\r\nacid.\r\n\r\nIII.

This sometimes arises from their having too long been\r\nrestrained from making water from accidental confinement in public society,\r\nor otherwise; whence the bladder has become so far distended as to become\r\nparalytic; and not only this, but the neck of the bladder has become\r\ncontracted so as to resist the introduction of the catheter. In this\r\ndeplorable case it has frequently happened, that the forcible efforts to\r\nintroduce the catheter have perforated the urethra; and the instrument has\r\nbeen supposed to pass into the bladder when it has only passed into the\r\ncellular membrane along the side of it; of which I believe I have seen two\r\nor three instances; and afterwards the part has become so much inflamed as\r\nto render the introduction of the catheter into the bladder impracticable.\r\n\r\nIn this situation the patients are in imminent danger, and some have\r\nadvised a trocar to be introduced into the bladder from the rectum; which I\r\nbelieve is generally followed by an incurable ulcer. One patient, whom I\r\nsaw in this situation, began to make a spoonful of water after six or seven\r\ndays, and gradually in a few days emptied his bladder to about half its\r\nsize, and recovered; but I believe he never afterwards was able completely\r\nto evacuate it.\r\n\r\nIn this situation I lately advised about two pounds of crude quicksilver to\r\nbe poured down a glass tube, which was part of a barometer tube, drawn less\r\nat one end, and about two feet long, into the urethra, as the patient lay\r\non his back; which I had previously performed upon a horse; this easily\r\npassed, as was supposed, into the bladder; on standing erect it did not\r\nreturn, but on kneeling down, and lying horizontally on his hands, the\r\nmercury readily returned; and on this account it was believed to have\r\npassed into the bladder, as it so easily returned, when the neck of the\r\nbladder was lower than the fundus of it. But nevertheless as no urine\r\nfollowed the mercury, though the bladder was violently distended, I was led\r\nto believe, that the urethra had been perforated by the previous efforts to\r\nintroduce a catheter and bougee; and that the mercury had passed on the\r\noutside of the bladder into the cellular membrane.\r\n\r\nAs the urethra is so liable to be perforated by the forcible efforts to\r\nintroduce the catheter, when the bladder is violently distended in this\r\ndeplorable disease, I should strongly recommend the injection of a pound or\r\ntwo of crude mercury into the urethra to open by its weight the neck of the\r\nbladder previous to any violent or very frequent essays with a catheter\r\nwhether of metal or of elastic resin.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *
