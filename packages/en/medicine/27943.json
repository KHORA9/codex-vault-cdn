But their utmost sincerity and science are hampered by\r\ntrying restrictions with three great classes of people: those on whom\r\nthe family physician cannot call _every day_; those on whom he cannot\r\ncall _in time_; and those on whom he cannot call _at all_.\r\n\r\nTo lessen these restrictions, thus assisting and extending the\r\nhealer's work, is the aim of the pages that follow.\r\n\r\nConsider first the average American household, where the family\r\nphysician cannot call _every day_. Not a day finds this household\r\nwithout the need of information in medicine or hygiene or sanitation.\r\nMore efforts of the profession are thwarted by ignorance than by\r\nepidemic. Not to supplant the doctor, but to supplement him, carefully\r\nprepared information should be at hand on the hygiene of\r\nhealth--sanitation, diet, exercise, clothing, baths, etc.; on the\r\nhygiene of disease--nursing and sick-room conduct, control of the\r\nnervous and insane, emergency resources, domestic remedies; above all,\r\non the prevention of disease, emphasizing the folly of self-treatment;\r\npointing out the danger of delay in seeking skilled medical advice\r\nwith such troubles as cancer, where early recognition may bring\r\npermanent cure; showing the benefit of simple sanitary precautions,\r\nsuch as the experiment-stations method of exterminating the\r\nmalaria-breeding mosquito. The volumes treating of these subjects\r\ncannot be made too clear, nontechnical, fundamental, or too well\r\nguarded by the supervision of medical men known favorably to the\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\nAgain, the physician cannot come _on time_ to save life, limb, or\r\nlooks to the victim of many a serious accident. And yet some bystander\r\ncould usually understand and apply plain rules for inducing\r\nrespiration, applying a splint, giving an emetic, soothing a burn or\r\nthe like, so as to safeguard the sufferer till the doctor's\r\narrival--if only these plain rules were in such compact form that no\r\noffice, store, or home in the land need be without them.\r\n\r\nFinally, the doctor _cannot come at all_ to hundreds of thousands of\r\nsailors, automobilists, and other travelers, to ranchers, miners, and\r\ncountry dwellers of many sorts. This third class has had, hitherto,\r\nlittle choice between some \"Practice of Medicine,\" too technical to be\r\nhelpful, on the one hand, and on the other, the dubious literature of\r\nunsanctioned \"systems\"; or the startling \"cure-all\" assertions\r\nemanating from many proprietors of remedies; or \"Complete Family\r\nPhysicians,\" which offer prescriptions as absurd for the layman as\r\nwould be dynamite in the hands of a child, with superfluous and\r\nloathsome pictures appealing only to morbid curiosity, and with a\r\ngeneral inaccuracy utterly out of touch with twentieth-century\r\nknowledge. What such people need, much more than the dwellers in\r\nsettled communities, is to learn the views of modern medicine upon the\r\ntreatment of the ever-present common ailments--the use of standard\r\nremedies, cautions against the abuse of narcotics, lessons of\r\ndiscrimination against harmful, useless, or expensive \"patent\r\nmedicines,\" and proper rules of conduct for diet, nursing, and general\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nAuthentic health literature existed abundantly before the preparation\r\nof these volumes, but it was scattered, expensive, and in most cases\r\nnot arranged for the widest use. Not within our knowledge has the body\r\nof facts, most helpful to the layman on Sanitation and Hygiene, First\r\nAid, and Domestic Healing, been brought together as completely, as\r\nclearly, as concisely, with a critical editing board so qualified, and\r\nwith special contributions so authoritative as this work exhibits.\r\n\r\n\"Utmost caution\" has been a watchword with the editors from the start.\r\nThose to whom the doctor _cannot come every day_ have been repeatedly\r\nwarned of the follies of self-treatment, and reminded that to-day it\r\nis the patient that is treated--not the disease. Those to whom the\r\ndoctor _cannot come in time_ are likewise warned that the \"First-aid\r\nRules\" of this Library are for temporary treatment only, in all\r\nsituations where it is possible to get a physician. And the utmost\r\nconservatism has been striven for by the author and the several\r\nrevisers in every part of the work that appeals particularly to\r\ndwellers in localities so removed that the doctor _cannot come at\r\nall_. Especial delicacy was also sought in the treatment of a chapter\r\nwhich, it is hoped, will aid parents to guide their children in sexual\r\nmatters. The illustrations represent helpful, normal conditions (with\r\nthe exception of some necessary representations of fracture, etc.)\r\nwith instructive captions aimed to make them less a sensation than a\r\nreal benefit; and no pictures appear of a sort to stimulate mere\r\nmorbid curiosity.\r\n\r\nThe greatest sympathy and appreciation of this work have been shown by\r\nthe progressive and recognized practitioners who have seen early\r\ncopies. They recognize it as a timely attempt to create and compile\r\nhealth literature in a form most complete within its limits of space,\r\nand in a manner most helpful and sane. The eager curiosity regarding\r\n_themselves_ that has been sweeping over the American people has been\r\ndiverted into frivolous and harmful channels by much reckless talk and\r\nwriting. A prominent newspaper, in its Sunday editions, recently took\r\nup the assertion, in a series of articles, that appendicitis\r\noperations resulted from a gigantic criminal conspiracy on the part of\r\nsurgeons; that a sufficient cure for appendicitis, \"as any honest\r\ndoctor would tell you,\" is an injection of molasses and water! The\r\nendless harm done by such outright untruth is swelled by a joining\r\nstream of slapdash misinformation and vicious sensation, constantly\r\nrunning through the press.\r\n\r\nEducation is sorely needed from authority. People _will_ read about\r\ntheir bodies. They have a right to information from the highest\r\naccredited source. And to apply such knowledge Dr. Winslow has labored\r\nfor many years during his practicing experience, condensing and\r\nsetting into clear order the most vitally important facts of domestic\r\ndisease and treatment; an eminently qualified staff of practicing\r\nspecialists has cooeperated, with criticism and supervision of\r\nincalculable value to the reader; and the accepted classics in their\r\nfield follow: Dr. Weir Mitchell's elegant and inspiring essays on\r\nNerves, Outdoor Life, etc.; Sir Henry Thompson's \"precious documents\r\nof personal experience\" on Diet and Conduct for Long Life; Dr. Dudley\r\nA. Sargent's scientific and long-prepared system of exercises without\r\napparatus; Gerhard's clear principles of pure water supply; Dr.\r\nDarlington's notes and editing from the unequaled opportunity of a New\r\nYork City Health Commissioner--and many other \"special contributions.\"\r\n\r\nIt is the widely accepted modern medicine, and no school or \"system,\"\r\nthat is reflected here. While medicine, as a science, is far from\r\nbeing perfect, partly because of faulty traditions and misinterpreted\r\nexperience, yet the aim of the modern school is to base practice on\r\n_facts_. For example, for many years physicians were aware that\r\nquinine cured malaria, in some unexplainable way. Now they not only\r\nknow that malaria is caused by an animal parasite living and breeding\r\nin the blood and that quinine destroys the foe, but they know about\r\nthe parasite's habits and mode of development and when it most readily\r\nsuccumbs to the drug. Thus a great discovery taught them to give\r\nquinine understandingly, at the right time, and in the right doses.\r\n\r\nAn educated physician has at his command all knowledge, past and\r\npresent, pertaining to medicine. He is free to employ any means to\r\nbetter his patient. Now it is impossible to cure, or even better, all\r\nwho suffer from certain disease by any one method, and a follower of a\r\nspecial \"system\" thus ignores many agencies which might prove\r\nefficient in his case. While there is a germ of good and truth in the\r\nvarious \"systems\" of medical practice, their representatives possess\r\nno knowledge unknown to science or to the medical profession at large.\r\nMany persons are always attracted by \"something new.\" But newness in a\r\nmedical sect is too often newness in name only. These systems rise and\r\nfall, but scientific, legitimate medicine goes ever onward with an eye\r\nsingle to the discovery of new facts.\r\n\r\nThat these volumes will result in an impetus to saner, quieter,\r\nsteadier living, and will prove a helpful friend to many a physician\r\nand many a layman, is the earnest wish of\r\n\r\n                                                       THE PUBLISHERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart I\r\n\r\nFIRST AID IN EMERGENCIES\r\n\r\nBY\r\n\r\nKENELM WINSLOW\r\n\r\nAND\r\n\r\nALBERT WARREN FERRIS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Introductory Note_\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the opening chapter, which contains the valuable\r\nLife-saving Service Rules _verbatim_, the Editors have adopted the\r\nplan of beginning each article in Part I of this volume with a few\r\nsimple, practical instructions, telling the reader exactly what to do\r\nin case of an accident. For the purpose of distinguishing them from\r\nthe ordinary text, and making them easy of reference, these\r\n_\"First-aid Rules\" are printed in light-faced type_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n=Restoring the Apparently Drowned=\r\n\r\n_As Practiced in the United States Life-Saving Service_\r\n\r\n\r\n    NOTE.--These directions differ from those given in the last\r\n    revision of the Regulations by the addition of means for securing\r\n    deeper inspiration. The method heretofore published, known as the\r\n    Howard, or direct method, has been productive of excellent results\r\n    in the practice of the service, and is retained here. It is,\r\n    however, here arranged for practice in combination with the\r\n    Sylvester method, the latter producing deeper inspiration than any\r\n    other known method, while the former effects the most complete\r\n    expiration. The combination, therefore, tends to produce the most\r\n    rapid oxygenation of the blood--the real object to be gained. The\r\n    combination is prepared primarily for the use of life-saving crews\r\n    where assistants are at hand. A modification of Rule III, however,\r\n    is published as a guide in cases where no assistants are at hand\r\n    and one person is compelled to act alone. In preparing these\r\n    directions the able and exhaustive report of Messrs. J. Collins\r\n    Warren, M.D., and George B. Shattuck, M.D., committee of the\r\n    Humane Society of Massachusetts, embraced in the annual report of\r\n    the society for 1895-96, has been availed of, placing the\r\n    department under many obligations to these gentlemen for their\r\n    valuable suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n=IF SEVERAL ASSISTANTS ARE AT HAND.=\r\n\r\nRULE I. _Arouse the Patient._--Do not move the patient unless in\r\ndanger of freezing; instantly expose the face to the air, toward the\r\nwind if there be any; wipe dry the mouth and nostrils; rip the\r\nclothing so as to expose the chest and waist; give two or three quick,\r\nsmarting slaps on the chest with the open hand.\r\n\r\nIf the patient does not revive, proceed immediately as follows:\r\n\r\nRULE II. _To Expel Water from the Stomach and Chest_ (see Fig.\r\n1).--Separate the jaws and keep them apart by placing between the\r\nteeth a cork or small bit of wood, turn the patient on his face, a\r\nlarge bundle of tightly rolled clothing being placed beneath the\r\nstomach; press heavily on the back over it for half a minute, or as\r\nlong as fluids flow freely from the mouth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.\r\n\r\nTO EXPEL WATER FROM STOMACH AND CHEST.\r\n\r\nPatient lying face downward; roll of clothes beneath stomach; jaws\r\nseparated by piece of wood or cork; note rescuer pressing on back to\r\nforce out water.]\r\n\r\nRULE III. _To Produce Breathing_ (see Figs. 2 and 3).--Clear the mouth\r\nand throat of mucus by introducing into the throat the corner of a\r\nhandkerchief wrapped closely around the forefinger; turn the patient\r\non the back, the roll of clothing being so placed as to raise the pit\r\nof the stomach above the level of the rest of the body. Let an\r\nassistant, with a handkerchief or piece of dry cloth, draw the tip of\r\nthe tongue out of one corner of the mouth (which prevents the tongue\r\nfrom falling back and choking the entrance to the windpipe), and keep\r\nit projecting a little beyond the lips. Let another assistant grasp\r\nthe arms, just below the elbows, and draw them steadily upward by the\r\nsides of the patient's head to the ground, the hands nearly meeting\r\n(which enlarges the capacity of the chest and induces inspiration).\r\n(Fig. 2.) While this is being done let a third assistant take position\r\nastride the patient's hips with his elbows resting upon his own knees,\r\nhis hands extended ready for action. Next, let the assistant standing\r\nat the head turn down the patient's arms to the sides of the body, the\r\nassistant holding the tongue changing hands if necessary[1] to let the\r\narms pass. Just before the patient's hands reach the ground the man\r\nastride the body will grasp the body with his hands, the balls of the\r\nthumb resting on either side of the pit of the stomach, the fingers\r\nfalling into the grooves between the short ribs. Now, using his knees\r\nas a pivot, he will, at the moment the patient's hands touch the\r\nground, throw (not too suddenly) all his weight forward on his\r\nhands, and at the same time squeeze the waist between them, as if he\r\nwished to force something in the chest upward out of the mouth; he\r\nwill deepen the pressure while he slowly counts one, two, three, four\r\n(about five seconds), then suddenly let go with a final push, which\r\nwill spring him back to his first position.[2] This completes\r\nexpiration. (Fig. 3.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.\r\n\r\nTO PRODUCE BREATHING.\r\n\r\nFirst Position: Patient lying face upward; roll of clothes under back;\r\ntongue pulled out of mouth with handkerchief; note rescuer drawing\r\narms upward to sides of head to start act of breathing in.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.\r\n\r\nTO PRODUCE BREATHING.\r\n\r\nSecond Position: Forcing patient to breathe out; note rescuer with\r\nthumbs on pit of stomach, pressing against front of chest over lower\r\nribs; also, assistant drawing down arms to body.]\r\n\r\nAt the instant of his letting go, the man at the patient's head will\r\nagain draw the arms steadily upward to the sides of the patient's head\r\nas before (the assistant holding the tongue again changing hands to\r\nlet the arms pass if necessary), holding them there while he slowly\r\ncounts one, two, three, four (about five seconds).\r\n\r\nRepeat these movements deliberately and perseveringly twelve to\r\nfifteen times in every minute--thus imitating the natural motions of\r\nbreathing.\r\n\r\nIf natural breathing be not restored after a trial of the bellows\r\nmovement for the space of about four minutes, then turn the patient a\r\nsecond time on the stomach, as directed in Rule II, rolling the body\r\nin the opposite direction from that in which it was first turned, for\r\nthe purpose of freeing the air passage from any remaining water.\r\nContinue the artificial respiration from one to four hours, or until\r\nthe patient breathes, according to Rule III; and for a while, after\r\nthe appearance of returning life, carefully aid the first short gasps\r\nuntil deepened into full breaths. Continue the drying and rubbing,\r\nwhich should have been unceasingly practiced from the beginning by\r\nassistants, taking care not to interfere with the means employed to\r\nproduce breathing. Thus the limbs of the patient should be rubbed,\r\nalways in an upward direction toward the body, with firm-grasping\r\npressure and energy, using the bare hands, dry flannels, or\r\nhandkerchiefs, and continuing the friction under the blankets, or over\r\nthe dry clothing. The warmth of the body can also be promoted by the\r\napplication of hot flannels to the stomach and armpits, bottles or\r\nbladders of hot water, heated bricks, etc., to the limbs and soles of\r\nthe feet.\r\n\r\nRULE IV. _After Treatment. Externally._--As soon as breathing is\r\nestablished let the patient be stripped of all wet clothing, wrapped\r\nin blankets only, put to bed comfortably warm, but with a free\r\ncirculation of fresh air, and left to perfect rest. _Internally:_ Give\r\nwhisky or brandy and hot water in doses of a teaspoonful to a\r\ntablespoonful, according to the weight of the patient, or other\r\nstimulant at hand, every ten or fifteen minutes for the first hour,\r\nand as often thereafter as may seem expedient. _Later Manifestations:_\r\nAfter reaction is fully established there is great danger of\r\ncongestion of the lungs, and if perfect rest is not maintained for at\r\nleast forty-eight hours, it sometimes occurs that the patient is\r\nseized with great difficulty of breathing, and death is liable to\r\nfollow unless immediate relief is afforded. In such cases apply a\r\nlarge mustard plaster over the breast. If the patient gasps for breath\r\nbefore the mustard takes effect, assist the breathing by carefully\r\nrepeating the artificial respiration.\r\n\r\n\r\n=IF ONE PERSON MUST WORK ALONE.=\r\n\r\nMODIFICATION OF RULE III\r\n\r\n[_To be used after Rules I and II in case no assistance is at hand_]\r\n\r\n_To Produce Respiration._--If no assistance is at hand, and one person\r\nmust work alone, place the patient on his back with the shoulders\r\nslightly raised on a folded article of clothing; draw forward the\r\ntongue and keep it projecting just beyond the lips; if the lower jaw\r\nbe lifted, the teeth may be made to hold the tongue in place; it may\r\nbe necessary to retain the tongue by passing a handkerchief under the\r\nchin and tying it over the head.[3]\r\n\r\nGrasp the arms just below the elbows and draw them steadily upward by\r\nthe sides of the patient's head to the ground, the hands nearly\r\nmeeting. (See Fig. 4.)\r\n\r\nNext lower the arms to the side, and press firmly downward and\r\ninward on the sides and front of the chest over the lower ribs,\r\ndrawing arms toward the patient's head. (See Fig. 5.)\r\n\r\nRepeat these movements twelve to fifteen times every minute, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.\r\n\r\nONE PERSON WORKING.\r\n\r\nFirst Position: Note arm movement same as in Fig. 2; also, tongue held\r\nbetween teeth by handkerchief tied under chin pressing teeth against\r\nwooden plug.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.\r\n\r\nONE PERSON WORKING.\r\n\r\nSecond Position: Note rescuer lowering arms to patient's sides and\r\npressing downward and inward over lower ribs.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=INSTRUCTIONS FOR SAVING DROWNING PERSONS BY SWIMMING TO THEIR\r\nRELIEF.=\r\n\r\n1. When you approach a person drowning in the water, assure him, with\r\na loud and firm voice, that he is safe.\r\n\r\n2. Before jumping in to save him, divest yourself as far and as\r\nquickly as possible of all clothes; tear them off, if necessary; but\r\nif there is not time, loose at all events the foot of your drawers, if\r\nthey are tied, as, if you do not do so, they fill with water and drag\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n3. On swimming to a person in the sea, if he be struggling do not\r\nseize him then, but keep off for a few seconds till he gets quiet, for\r\nit is sheer madness to take hold of a man when he is struggling in the\r\nwater, and if you do you run a great risk.\r\n\r\n4. Then get close to him and take fast hold of the hair of his head,\r\nturn him as quickly as possible on to his back, give him a sudden\r\npull, and this will cause him to float, then throw yourself on your\r\nback also and swim for the shore, both hands having hold of his hair,\r\nyou on your back, and he also on his, and of course his back to your\r\nstomach. In this way you will get sooner and safer ashore than by any\r\nother means, and you can easily thus swim with two or three persons;\r\nthe writer has even, as an experiment, done it with four, and gone\r\nwith them forty or fifty yards in the sea. One great advantage of this\r\nmethod is that it enables you to keep your head up, and also to hold\r\nthe person's head up you are trying to save. It is of primary\r\nimportance that you take fast hold of the hair, and throw both the\r\nperson and yourself on your backs. After many experiments, it is\r\nusually found preferable to all other methods. You can in this manner\r\nfloat nearly as long as you please, or until a boat or other help can\r\nbe obtained.\r\n\r\n5. It is believed there is no such thing as a _death grasp_; at least,\r\nit is very unusual to witness it. As soon as a drowning man begins to\r\nget feeble and to lose his recollection, he gradually slackens his\r\nhold until he quits it altogether. No apprehension need, therefore, be\r\nfelt on that head when attempting to rescue a drowning person.\r\n\r\n6. After a person has sunk to the bottom, if the water be smooth, the\r\nexact position where the body lies may be known by the air bubbles,\r\nwhich will occasionally rise to the surface, allowance being, of\r\ncourse, made for the motion of the water, if in a tide way or stream,\r\nwhich will have carried the bubbles out of a perpendicular course in\r\nrising to the surface. Oftentimes a body may be regained from the\r\nbottom, before too late for recovery, by diving for it in the\r\ndirection indicated by these bubbles.\r\n\r\n7. On rescuing a person by diving to the bottom, the hair of the head\r\nshould be seized by one hand only, and the other used in conjunction\r\nwith the feet in raising yourself and the drowning person to the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\n8. If in the sea, it may sometimes be a great error to try to get to\r\nland. If there be a strong \"outsetting tide\" and you are swimming\r\neither by yourself or having hold of a person who cannot swim, then\r\nget on your back and float till help comes. Many a man exhausts\r\nhimself by stemming the billows for the shore on a back-going tide,\r\nand sinks in the effort, when, if he had floated, a boat or other aid\r\nmight have been obtained.\r\n\r\n9. These instructions apply alike to all circumstances, whether as\r\nregards the roughest sea or smooth water.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Changing hands will be found unnecessary after some practice; the\r\ntongue, however, must not be released.\r\n\r\n[2] A child or very delicate patient must, of course, be more gently\r\nhandled.\r\n\r\n[3] If there is stuck through the tongue a pin long enough to rest\r\nagainst the teeth and keep the tongue out of the mouth, the desired\r\neffect may be obtained.--EDITOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n=Heat Stroke and Electric Shock=\r\n\r\n_How Persons are Overcome by Heat--Treatment of Sunstroke--Peculiar\r\nCases--Dangers of Electric Shocks--How Death is Caused--Rules and\r\nPrecautions._\r\n\r\n\r\n=HEAT EXHAUSTION.=\r\n\r\n_First Aid Rule 1.--Carry patient flat and lay in shade.

F. put to bed with ice cap\r\non head._\r\n\r\n\r\n=SUNSTROKE.=--There are two very distinct types of sunstroke: (1) Heat\r\nexhaustion or heat prostration. (2) Heat stroke.\r\n\r\nHeat prostration or exhaustion occurs when persons weakened by\r\noverwork, worry, or poor food are exposed to severe heat combined with\r\ngreat physical exertion. It often attacks soldiers on the march, but\r\nalso those not exposed to the direct rays of the sun, as workers in\r\nlaundries, in boiler rooms, and in stoke-holes of steamers. The attack\r\nbegins more often in the afternoon or evening, in the case of those\r\nexposed to out-of-door heat. Feelings of weakness, dizziness, and\r\nrestlessness, accompanied by headache, are among the first symptoms.\r\nThe face is very pale, the skin is cool and moist, although the\r\ntrouble often starts with sudden arrest of sweating. There is great\r\nprostration, with feeble, rapid pulse, frequent and shallow breathing,\r\nand lowered temperature, ranging often from 95 deg. to 96 deg. F. The patient\r\nusually retains consciousness, but rarely there is complete\r\ninsensibility. The pernicious practice of permitting children at\r\nseaside resorts to wade about in cold water while their heads are\r\nbared to the burning sun is peculiarly adapted to favor heat\r\nprostration.\r\n\r\nHeat stroke happens more frequently to persons working hard under the\r\ndirect rays of the sun, especially laborers in large cities who are in\r\nthe habit of drinking some form of alcohol. It often occurs in\r\nunventilated tenements on stifling nights. Dizziness, violent\r\nheadache, seeing spots before the eyes, nausea, and attempts at\r\nvomiting, usher in the attack. Compare it with heat prostration, and\r\nnote the marked differences. The patient becomes suddenly and\r\ncompletely insensible, and falls to the ground, the face is flushed,\r\nthe breathing is noisy and difficult, the pulse is strong, and the\r\nthermometer placed in the bowel registers 107 deg., 108 deg., or 110 deg. F., or\r\nrarely higher. The muscles are usually relaxed, but sometimes there\r\nare twitchings, or even convulsions. Death often occurs within\r\ntwenty-four or thirty-six hours, preceded by failing pulse, deep\r\nunconsciousness, and rapid breathing, often labored or gasping,\r\nalternating with long intermissions. Sometimes delirium and\r\nunconsciousness last for days. Diminution of fever and returning\r\nconsciousness herald recovery, but it is a very fatal disorder,\r\nstatistics showing a death rate of from thirty to fifty per cent. Even\r\nwhen the patient lives, bad after effects are common. Peculiar\r\nsensibility to moderate heat is a frequent complaint. Loss of memory,\r\nweakened mental capacity, headache, irritability, fits, other mental\r\ndisturbances, and impairment of sight and hearing are among the more\r\nusual sequels, occurring in those who do not subsequently avoid the\r\ndirect rays of the sun, as well as an elevated temperature, and who\r\nindulge in alcoholic stimulants. A high degree of moisture in the air\r\nfavors sunstrokes, but it is a curious fact that sunstroke is much\r\nmore frequent in certain localities, and in special years than at\r\nother places and times with identical climatic conditions. This has\r\nled observers to suggest a germ origin of the disease, but this is\r\nextremely doubtful.\r\n\r\n=Treatment.=--Treatment for heat exhaustion is given in the\r\n\"first-aid\" directions. Little need be added to the directions for\r\ntreatment of heat stroke. In place of the ice cap suggested in Rule 7,\r\nice in cloths, or in a sponge bag may be substituted. The friction of\r\nthe body, as directed in Rule 6, is absolutely necessary to stimulate\r\nthe nervous system and circulation, and to prevent the blood from\r\nbeing driven into the internal organs by the cold applied externally.\r\nThe cold-water treatment is applied until the temperature falls down\r\nto within a few degrees of normal--that is, 98.6 deg. F. Then the patient\r\nshould be put into bed, there to remain, with ice to the head, until\r\nfully restored.\r\n\r\nIt often happens that the fever returns, in which event the whole\r\nprocess of applying cold water must be repeated. The simplest way of\r\nreducing the fever consists in laying the patient, entirely nude, on a\r\ncanvas cot or wire mattress, binding ice to the back of his neck, and\r\nhaving an attendant stand on a chair near by and pour ice water upon\r\nthe patient from a garden watering pot.\r\n\r\nWhile the patient is insensible no attempt should be made to give\r\nanything by the mouth; but half a pint of milk and two raw eggs with a\r\npinch of salt may be injected into the rectum every eight hours, after\r\nwashing it out with cold water on each occasion. Two tablespoonfuls of\r\nwhisky may be added to the injection, if the pulse is weak. If the\r\nurine is not passed spontaneously, it will be necessary to draw it\r\nonce in eight hours with a soft rubber catheter which has been boiled\r\nten minutes and lubricated with glycerin or clean vaseline.\r\n\r\n\r\n=ELECTRIC SHOCK OR LIGHTNING STROKE.=\r\n\r\n_First Aid Rule 1.--Protect yourself from being shocked by the victim.\r\nGrasp victim only by coat tails or dry clothes. Put rubber boots on\r\nyour hands, or work through silk petticoat; or throw loop of rubber\r\nsuspenders or of dry rope around him to pull him off wire, or pry him\r\nalong with dry stick._\r\n\r\n_Rule 2.--Do not lift, but drag victim away from wire toward the\r\nground. When free from wire, hold him head downward for two minutes._\r\n\r\n_Rule 3.--Assist heart to regain its strength. Apply mustard plaster\r\n(mustard and water) to chest over heart; wrap in blanket wrung out of\r\nvery hot water; give hypodermic of whisky, thirty minims._\r\n\r\n_Rule 4.--Induce artificial respiration. Open his mouth and grasp\r\ntongue, pull it forward just beyond lips, and hold it there. Let\r\nanother assistant grasp the arms just below the elbows and draw them\r\nsteadily upward by the sides of the patient's head to the ground, the\r\nhands nearly meeting (which enlarges the capacity of the chest and\r\ninduces inspiration, Fig. 2). While this is being done, let a third\r\nassistant take position astride the patient's hips with his elbows\r\nresting on his own knees, his hands extended, ready for action. Next,\r\nlet the assistant standing at the head turn down the patient's arms to\r\nthe sides of the body, the assistant holding the tongue changing\r\nhands, if necessary, to let the arms pass. Just before the patient's\r\nhands reach the ground, the man astride the body will grasp the body\r\nwith his hands, the ball of the thumb resting on either side of the\r\npit of the stomach, the fingers falling into the grooves between the\r\nshort ribs. Now, using his knees as a pivot, he will at the moment the\r\npatient's hands touch the ground throw (not too suddenly) all his\r\nweight forward on his hands, and at the same time squeeze the waist\r\nbetween them, as if he wished to force something in the chest upward\r\nout of the mouth; he will deepen the pressure while he slowly counts\r\none, two, three, four (about five seconds), then suddenly lets go with\r\na final push, which will send him back to his first position. This\r\ncompletes expiration. (A child or delicate person must be more gently\r\nhandled.)_\r\n\r\n_At the instant of letting go, the man at the patient's head will\r\nagain draw the arms steadily upward to the sides of the patient's\r\nhead, as before (the assistant holding the tongue again changing\r\nhands to let the arms pass, if necessary), holding them there while he\r\nslowly counts one, two, three, four (about five seconds)._\r\n\r\n_Repeat these movements deliberately and perseveringly twelve to\r\nfifteen times in every minute--thus imitating the natural motions of\r\nbreathing. Continue the artificial respiration from one to four hours,\r\nor until the patient breathes; and for a while, after the appearance\r\nof returning life, carefully aid the first short gasps until deepened\r\ninto full breaths._\r\n\r\n_Keep body warm with hot-water bottles, hot bricks to limbs and feet,\r\nand blankets over exposed lower part of body._\r\n\r\n_Rule 5.--Treat burn, if any. If skin is not broken, cover burn with\r\ncloths wet with Carron oil (equal parts of limewater and linseed or\r\nolive oil). If skin is broken, or raw surface is exposed, spread over\r\nit paste of equal parts of boric acid and vaseline, and bandage over\r\nall._\r\n\r\n=Conditions, Etc.=--A shock produced by contact with an electric\r\ncurrent is not of rare occurrence. Lightning stroke is very uncommon;\r\nstatistics show that in the United States each year there is one death\r\nfrom this cause to each million of inhabitants. There are several\r\nconditions which must be borne in mind when considering the accidental\r\neffect of an electric current. The pressure and strength of the\r\ncurrent (voltage and amperage) are often not nearly so important in\r\nregard to the effects on the body, as the area, duration, and location\r\nof the points of contact with the current, and the resistance offered\r\nby clothing and dry skin to the penetration of the electricity.\r\n\r\nWhen the heart lies in the course of the circuit, the danger is\r\ngreatest. A dog can be killed by a current of ten volts pressure when\r\ncontacts are made to the head and hind legs, because the current then\r\nflows through the heart, while a current of eighty volts is required\r\nto kill a dog, under the same conditions, if contacts are made to head\r\nand fore leg. In a general way alternating currents of low frequency\r\nare the most injurious to the body, and any current pressure higher\r\nthan two hundred volts is dangerous to life. On the other hand, a\r\ncurrent of ninety-five volts has proved fatal to a human being. In\r\nthis case the circumstances were particularly unfavorable to the\r\nvictim, as he was standing on an iron tank in boots wet with an\r\nalkaline solution, and probably studded on the soles with nails, when\r\nhe came in accidental contact with an industrial current. Moreover, he\r\nwas an habitual drunkard. In an instance of the contrary sort, a man\r\nreceived a current of 1,700 volts (periodicity about 130) for fifty\r\nseconds, in one of the early attempts at electro-execution, without\r\nbeing killed. The personal equation evidently enters into the matter.\r\nA strong physique here, as in other cases, is most favorable in\r\nresisting the effects of electric shock.\r\n\r\nHigh-pressure alternating currents (1,300 to 2,000 volts) are employed\r\nin electro-executions, and the contacts are carefully made, so that\r\nthe current will enter the brain and pass through the heart to the\r\nleg. The two most vital parts are thus affected. In industrial\r\naccidents such nice adjustments are fortunately almost impossible, and\r\nshocks received from high-pressure currents, even of 25,000 volts,\r\nhave not proved fatal because both the voltage and amperage have been\r\ngreatly lessened through poor contacts and great resistance of\r\nclothing and dry skin, and also because the heart is not usually\r\nincluded in the circuit.\r\n\r\nDeath is induced in one of three ways: 1. Currents of enormous voltage\r\nand amperage, as occur in lightning, actually destroy, burst and burn\r\nthe tissues through which the stroke passes. 2. Usually death follows\r\naccidents from industrial currents, owing to contraction of the heart,\r\nthe effect being the same as observed on other muscles. The heart\r\ninstantly ceases beating, and either remains absolutely quiet, or\r\nthere is a fine quivering of some of its fibers, as seen on opening\r\nthe chest in experiments upon animals. 3. A fatal issue may result\r\nfrom the passage of the current through the head, so affecting the\r\nnerve centers that govern respiration that the breathing ceases.\r\n\r\n=Symptoms.=--These are generally muscular contractions, faintness, and\r\nunconsciousness (sometimes convulsions, if the current passes through\r\nthe head), with failure of pulse and of breathing. For instance, a\r\nman who was removing a brush from a trolley car touched, with the\r\nother hand, a live rail. His muscles immediately contracted throwing\r\nhim back, and disconnecting him from contact with the current (500\r\nvolts). He then fainted and became unconscious for a short time. The\r\npulse was rapid and feeble, and the breathing also at first, but it\r\nlater became slower than usual. On regaining sensibility the patient\r\nvomited and got on his feet, although feeling very weak for two hours.\r\nUnconsciousness commonly lasts only a few moments in nonfatal cases,\r\nbut may continue for hours, its continuance being rather a favorable\r\nsign of ultimate recovery, if the heart and lungs are acting\r\nsufficiently. Bad after effects are rare. It is not uncommon for the\r\npatient to declare that the accident had improved his general\r\nfeelings. Occasionally there is temporary loss of muscular power, and\r\na case has been reported of nervous symptoms following electric shock\r\nsimilar to those observed after any accidental violence. Burns of\r\nvarying degrees of intensity occur at the point of entrance of the\r\ncurrent, from slight blisters to complete destruction of all the\r\ntissues.\r\n\r\n=Treatment.=--The treatment is completely outlined in the \"first-aid\"\r\ndirections. Should contact be unbroken, an order to shut off the\r\nelectric current should at once be telephoned to the station.\r\nProtection of the rescuer with thick rubber gloves is of course the\r\nideal safeguard.\r\n\r\nIn fatal cases the heart is instantaneously arrested, and nothing can\r\nbe done to start it into action. If the current passes through the\r\nbrain, by contact with the head or neck, then failure of breathing is\r\nmore apt to be the cause of death. Theoretically, it is in the latter\r\nevent only that treatment, i. e., artificial respiration, will be of\r\navail.\r\n\r\nBut as in any individual case the exact condition is always a matter\r\nof doubt, _artificial respiration_ is the most valuable remedial\r\nmeasure we possess; it should always be practiced for hours in\r\ndoubtful cases. Two tablespoonfuls of brandy or whisky in a cup of\r\nwarm water may be injected into the bowel, if a hypodermic syringe is\r\nnot available and the patient needs decided stimulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n=Wounds, Sprains and Bruises=\r\n\r\n_Treatment of Wounds--Rules for Checking Hemorrhage--Lockjaw--Bandages\r\nfor Sprains--Synovitis--Bunions and Felons--Foreign Bodies in the Eye,\r\nEar and Nose._\r\n\r\n\r\n=WOUNDS.=--A wound is a condition produced by a forcible cutting,\r\ncontusing, or tearing of the tissues of the body, and includes, in its\r\nlarger sense, bruises, sprains, dislocations, and breaks or fractures\r\nof bones. As ordinarily used, a wound is an injury produced by\r\nforcible separation of the skin or mucous membrane, with more or less\r\ninjury to the underlying parts.\r\n\r\n_The main object during the care of wounds should be to avoid\r\ncontamination with anything which is not surgically clean, from the\r\nbeginning to the end of the dressing; otherwise, every other step in\r\nthe whole process is rendered useless._\r\n\r\nThree essentials in the treatment of wounds are:\r\n\r\n1. The arrest of bleeding. 2. Absolute cleanliness. 3. Rest of the\r\ninjured part. Dangerous bleeding demands immediate relief.\r\n\r\nBleeding is of three kinds: 1. From a large artery. 2. From a vein. 3.\r\nGeneral oozing.\r\n\r\n\r\n=BLEEDING FROM LARGE ARTERY IN SPURTS OF BRIGHT BLOOD.=\r\n\r\n_First Aid Rule 1.--Speed increases safety. Put patient down flat.\r\nMake pressure with hands between the wound and the heart till surgeon\r\narrives, assistants taking turns._\r\n\r\n_Rule 2.--If arm or leg, tie rubber tubing or rubber suspenders tight\r\nabout limb between wound and heart, or tie strap or rope over\r\nhandkerchief or folded shirt wrapped about limb. If arm, put baseball\r\nin arm pit, and press arm against this. Or, for arm or leg, tie folded\r\ncloth in loose noose around limb, put cane or umbrella through noose\r\nand twist up the slack very tight, so as to compress the main artery\r\nwith knot._\r\n\r\n_Rule 3.--Keep limb and patient warm with hot-water bottles till\r\nsurgeon arrives._\r\n\r\nThis treatment is of course only a temporary expedient, as it is\r\nessential for a surgeon to tie the bleeding vessel itself; therefore a\r\nmedical man should be summoned with all dispatch.\r\n\r\n\r\n=BLEEDING FROM VEIN; STEADY FLOW OF DARK BLOOD.=\r\n\r\n_First Aid Rule 1.--Make firm pressure with pad of cloth directly over\r\nwound, also with hands between wound and extremity, that is, on side\r\nof cut away from the heart._\r\n\r\n_Rule 2.--Tie tight bandage about limb at this point, with rubber\r\ntubing or suspenders._\r\n\r\n_Rule 3.--Keep limb and patient warm with hot-water bottles till\r\nsurgeon arrives._\r\n\r\nIn the cases of bleeding from a vein, the flow of blood is continuous,\r\nand is of a dark, red hue, and does not spurt in jets, as from an\r\nartery. This kind of bleeding is not usually difficult to stop, and it\r\nis not necessary that the vein itself be tied--unless very\r\nlarge--provided that the wound be snugly bandaged after it is dressed.\r\nAfter the first half hour, release the limb and see if the bleeding\r\nhas stopped. If so, and the circulation is being interfered with,\r\nowing to the tightness of the bandage, reapply the bandage more\r\nloosely.\r\n\r\nIn the case of an injured artery of any considerable size, the amount\r\nof pressure required to stop the bleeding will arrest all circulation\r\nof blood in the limb, so that great damage, as well as pain, will\r\nensue if it be continued more than an hour or two, and during this\r\ntime the limb should be kept warm by thick covering and hot-water\r\nbags, if they can be obtained.\r\n\r\nBleeding _from a deep puncture_ may be stopped by plugging the cavity\r\nwith strips of muslin which have been boiled, or with absorbent\r\ncotton, similarly treated, keeping the plug in place by snug\r\nbandaging.\r\n\r\n\r\n=BLEEDING FROM PUNCTURED WOUND.=\r\n\r\n_First Aid Rule 1.--Extract pin, tack, nail, splinter, thorn, or\r\nbullet, IF YOU CAN SEE BULLET; do not probe._\r\n\r\n_Rule 2.--Pour warm water on wound and squeeze tissue to encourage\r\nbleeding. Send for small hard-rubber syringe._\r\n\r\n_Rule 3.--If deep, plug it with absorbent cotton, and put tight\r\nbandage over plug. If shallow, cover with absorbent cotton wet with\r\nboric-acid solution (one dram to one-half pint of water), or\r\ncarbolic-acid solution (one teaspoonful to the pint of hot water)._\r\n\r\n_Rule 4.--When syringe comes, remove dressing, and clean wound by\r\nforcibly syringing carbolic solution directly into wound. Replace\r\ndressing._\r\n\r\nA small punctured wound should be squeezed in warm water to encourage\r\nbleeding and, if pain and swelling ensue, absorbent cotton soaked in a\r\nboric-acid solution (containing as much boric acid as the water will\r\ndissolve) or in carbolic-acid solution (one teaspoonful of pure acid\r\nto the pint of warm water) should be applied over the wound and\r\ncovered with oil silk or rubber or enamel cloth for a few days, or\r\nuntil the soreness has subsided. The dressing should be wet with the\r\nsolution as often as it becomes dry. Punctures by nails, especially if\r\ndeep, should be washed out with a syringe, using one of the solutions\r\njust mentioned. A medicine dropper, minus the rubber part, attached to\r\na fountain syringe, makes a good nozzle for this purpose. A moist\r\ndressing, like the one described, should then be applied, and the limb\r\nkept in perfect rest for a few days.\r\n\r\nWhen a surgeon's services are available, however, self-treatment is\r\nattended with too much danger, as a thorough opening up of such wounds\r\nwith proper cleansing and drainage will afford a better prospect of\r\nearly recovery, and avert the risk of serious inflammation and\r\nlockjaw, which sometimes follow punctured wounds of the hands and\r\nfeet. Foreign bodies, as splinters, may be removed with tweezers or a\r\nneedle, being careful not to break the splinter in the attempt. If a\r\npart remains in the flesh, or if the foreign body is a needle that\r\ncannot be found or removed at once, the continuous application of a\r\nhot flaxseed or other poultice will lead to the formation of \"matter,\"\r\nwith which the splinter or needle will often escape after a few days.\r\nSplinters finding their way under the nail may be removed by scraping\r\nthe nail very thin over the splinter and splitting it with a sharp\r\nknife down to the point where the end of the splinter can be grasped.\r\n\r\n\r\n=BLEEDING IN FORM OF OOZING.=\r\n\r\n_First Aid Rule 1.--Apply water as hot as hand can bear._\r\n\r\n_Rule 2.--Elevate the part, and drench with carbolic solution (one\r\nteaspoonful of carbolic acid to one pint of hot water)._\r\n\r\n_Rule 3.--Bandage snugly while wet._\r\n\r\n_Rule 4.--Keep patient warm with hot-water bottles._\r\n\r\n\r\n=GENERAL OOZING= happens in the case of small wounds or from abraded\r\nsurfaces, and is caused by the breaking of numerous minute vessels\r\nwhich are not large enough to require the treatment recommended for\r\nlarge arteries or veins. It is rarely dangerous, and usually stops\r\nspontaneously. When the loss of blood has been considerable, so that\r\nthe patient is pale, faint, and generally relaxed, with cold skin, and\r\nperhaps nausea and vomiting, he should be stripped of all clothing and\r\nimmediately wrapped in a blanket wrung out of hot water, and then\r\ncovered with dry blankets. Heat should also be applied to the feet by\r\nmeans of hot-water bags or bottles, with great care not to burn a\r\nsemiconscious patient's skin. The head should be kept low, and two\r\ntablespoonfuls of brandy, whisky, or other alcoholic liquor should be\r\ngiven in a half cup of hot water by the mouth, if the patient can\r\nswallow. If much blood has been lost a quart of water, as hot as the\r\nhand can readily bear, and containing a teaspoonful of common salt,\r\nshould be injected by means of a fountain syringe into the rectum.\r\n\r\nSomewhat the condition just described as due to loss of blood may be\r\ncaused simply by shock to the nervous system following any severe\r\naccident, and not attended by bleeding. The treatment of shock is,\r\nhowever, practically the same as that for hemorrhage, and improvement\r\nin either case is shown by return of color to the face and strength in\r\nthe pulse. Bleeding is apt to be much less in badly torn than in\r\nincised wounds, even if large vessels are severed, as when the legs\r\nare cut off in railroad accidents, for the lacerated ends of the\r\nvessels become entangled with blood and favor clotting.\r\n\r\n\r\n=LOCKJAW.=--In the lesser injuries, where bleeding is not an important\r\nfeature, and in all wounds as well, after bleeding has been stopped,\r\nthe main object in treatment consists in cleansing wounds of the germs\r\nwhich cause \"matter\" or pus, general blood poisoning, and lockjaw. The\r\ngerms of the latter live in the earth, and even the smallest wounds\r\nwhich heal perfectly may later give rise to lockjaw if dirt has not\r\nbeen entirely removed from the wound at the time of accident. Injuries\r\nto the hands caused by pistols, firecrackers, and kindred explosives,\r\nseem especially prone to produce lockjaw, and fatalities from this\r\ndisorder are deplorably numerous after Fourth-of-July celebrations in\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nThe wounds producing lockjaw usually occur in children who explode\r\nblank cartridges in the palm of the hand. In this way the germs of the\r\ndisease are forced in with parts of the dirty skin and more or less of\r\nthe wad from the shell. Since lockjaw is so frequent after these\r\naccidents, and so fatal, it is impossible to exert too much care in\r\ntreatment. The wound should at once be thoroughly opened with a knife\r\nto the very bottom, under ether, by a surgeon, and not only every\r\nparticle of foreign matter removed, but all the surrounding tissue\r\nshould be cut out or cauterized. In addition, it is wise to use an\r\ninjection under the skin of tetanus-antitoxin, to prevent the disease.\r\nProper restriction of the sale of explosives alone will put a stop to\r\nthis barbarous mode of exhibiting patriotism.\r\n\r\n=Treatment.=--It is not essential to use chemical agents or\r\nantiseptics to rid wounds of germs and so secure uninterrupted\r\nhealing. The person who is to dress the wound should prepare to do so\r\nat the earliest possible moment after giving first aid. He should\r\nproceed promptly to boil some pieces of absorbent cotton, as large as\r\nan egg, together with a nail brush in water. Some strips of clean\r\ncotton cloth may be used in the absence of absorbent cotton. The\r\nboiling should be conducted for five minutes, when the basin or other\r\nutensil in which the brush and cotton are boiled should be taken off\r\nthe fire and set aside to cool. Then the attendant should scrub his\r\nown hands for five minutes in hot water with soap and brush.\r\n\r\nHe next takes the brush, which has been boiled, out of the water and\r\ncleans the patient's skin for a considerable distance about the wound.\r\nWhen this is done, and the water and cotton which have been boiled are\r\nsufficiently cool, the wound should be bathed with the cotton and\r\nboiled water until all foreign matter has been removed from the wound;\r\nnot only dirt which can be seen, but germs which cannot be seen. Some\r\nof the boiled cotton cloth or absorbent cotton, wet as it is, should\r\nbe placed over the wound and the whole covered by a bandage. Large\r\ngaping wounds are of course more properly closed by stitches, but very\r\ndeep wounds should be left partly open, so that the discharge may\r\ndrain away freely. Small, deep, punctured wounds are not to be closed\r\nat all, but should be sedulously kept open by pushing in strips of\r\nboiled cotton cloth, in order to secure drainage.\r\n\r\nIf the attendant has the requisite confidence, there is no reason why\r\nhe should not attempt stitching a wound, providing the patient is\r\nwilling, and a surgeon cannot be obtained within twenty-four hours. In\r\nthis case a rather stout, common sewing needle or needles are threaded\r\nwith black or white thread, preferably of silk, and, together with a\r\npair of scissors and a clean towel, are boiled in the same utensil\r\nwith the cotton and the nail brush. After the operator has scrubbed\r\nhis hands and cleansed the wound, he places the boiled towel about the\r\nwound so that the thread will fall on it during his manipulations and\r\nnot on the skin. The needle should be thrust into and through the\r\nskin, but no lower than this, and should enter and leave the skin\r\nabout a quarter of an inch from either edge of the wound. The stitches\r\nare placed about one-half inch apart, and are drawn together and tied\r\ntightly enough to join the two edges of the wound. The ends of the\r\nthread should be cut about one-half inch from the knot, being careful\r\nwhile using the needle and scissors not to lay them down on anything\r\nexcept the boiled towel. The wound is then covered with cotton, which\r\nhas been boiled as described above, bandaged and left undisturbed for\r\na week, if causing no pain. At the end of this time the stitches are\r\ntaken out after the attendant has washed his hands carefully, and\r\nboiled his scissors as before.\r\n\r\nCourt plaster or plaster of any kind is a bad covering or dressing for\r\nwounds, as it may be itself contaminated with germs. It effectually\r\nkeeps in any with which the wound is already infected, and prevents\r\nproper drainage.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible in a work of this kind to describe the details of the\r\nafter treatment of wounds, as this can only be properly undertaken by\r\na surgeon, owing to the varying conditions which may arise. In general\r\nit may be stated that the same cleanliness and care should be followed\r\nduring the whole course of healing as has been outlined for the first\r\nattempt at treatment.\r\n\r\nIf the wound is small, and there is no discharge from it, it may be\r\npainted with collodion or covered with boric-acid ointment (sixty\r\ngrains of boric acid to the ounce of vaseline) after the first day. If\r\nlarge, it should be covered with cotton gauze or cloth which have been\r\nboiled or specially prepared for surgical purposes. If pus (\"matter\")\r\nforms, the wound must be cleansed daily of discharge (more than once\r\nif it is copious) with boiled water, or best with hydrogen dioxide\r\nsolution followed by a washing with a solution of carbolic acid (one\r\nteaspoonful to the pint of hot water), or with a solution of mercury\r\nbichloride, dissolving one of the larger bichloride tablets, sold for\r\nsurgical uses, in a quart of water.\r\n\r\nIt is a surgical maxim never to be neglected that wounds should not be\r\nallowed to close at the top before healing is completed at the bottom.\r\nAs to close at the surface is the usual tendency in wounds that heal\r\nslowly and discharge pus, it is necessary at times to enlarge the\r\nexternal opening by cutting or stretching with the blades of a pair of\r\nscissors, or, and this is much more rational and comfortable for the\r\npatient, by daily packing the outlet of the wound with gauze to keep\r\nit open.\r\n\r\n\r\n=BLEEDING FROM SCALP.=\r\n\r\n_First Aid Rule 1.--Cut hair off about wound, and clean thoroughly\r\nwith carbolic-acid solution (one teaspoonful to pint of hot water)._\r\n\r\n_Rule 2.--Put pad of gauze or muslin directly over wet wound, and make\r\npressure firmly with bandage._\r\n\r\nIn case of wounds of the scalp, or other hairy parts, the hair should\r\nbe cut, or better shaved, over an area very much larger than the\r\nwounded surface, after which the cleansing should be done. To stop\r\nbleeding of the scalp, water is applied as hot as can be borne, and\r\nthen a wad of boiled cotton should be placed in the wound and\r\nbandaged down tightly into it for a time. Closing the wound with\r\nstitches will stop the bleeding much more effectively, however, and is\r\nnot very painful if done immediately after the accident. The stitches\r\nshould be tied loosely, and not introduced nearer to each other than\r\nhalf an inch, to allow drainage of discharge from the wound.\r\n\r\n=General Remarks.=--All wounds should be kept at rest after they are\r\ndressed. This is accomplished in the case of the lower limbs by\r\nkeeping the patient in bed with the leg raised on a pillow.\r\n\r\nThe same kind of treatment applies in severe injuries of the hands. In\r\nless serious cases a sling may be employed, and the patient may walk\r\nabout. When the injury is near a joint, as of the fingers, knee,\r\nwrist, or elbow, a splint made of thin board or tin (and covered with\r\ncotton wadding and bandaged) should be applied by means of surgeon's\r\nadhesive plaster and bandage after the wound has been dressed. In\r\ninjuries of the hand the splint should be applied to the palm side,\r\nand reach from the finger tips to above the wrist. Use a splint also.\r\n\r\n\r\n=NOSEBLEED.=\r\n\r\n_First Aid Rule 1.--Seat patient erect and apply ice to nape of neck._\r\n\r\n_Rule 2.--Put roll of brown paper under upper lip, and press lip\r\nfirmly against it. Press facial artery against lower jaw of bleeding\r\nside, till bleeding stops. This artery crosses lower edge of jawbone\r\none inch in front of angle of jaw._\r\n\r\n_Rule 3.--Plug nostril with strip of thin cotton or muslin cloth._\r\n\r\n_Rule 4.--Do not wash away clots; encourage clotting to close\r\nnostril._\r\n\r\n\r\n=BLEEDING FROM LUNGS; BRIGHT BLOOD COUGHED UP.=\r\n\r\n=BLEEDING FROM STOMACH; DARK BLOOD VOMITED.=\r\n\r\n_First Aid Rule for both. Let patient lie flat and swallow small\r\npieces of ice, and also take one-quarter teaspoonful of table salt in\r\nhalf a glass of cold water._\r\n\r\n\r\n=BRUISE.=\r\n\r\n_First Aid Rule 1.--Bandage from tips of fingers, or from toes, making\r\nsame pressure with bandage all the way up as you do over the injury._\r\n\r\n_Rule 2.--Apply heat through the bandage, over the injury, with\r\nhot-water bottles._\r\n\r\n=Cause, Etc.=--A bruise is a hidden wound; the skin is not broken. It\r\nis an injury caused by a blunt body so that, while the tougher skin\r\nremains intact, the parts beneath are torn and crushed to a greater or\r\nlesser extent. The smaller blood vessels are torn and blood escapes\r\nunder the skin, giving the \"black and blue\" appearance so common in\r\nbruises of any severity. Sometimes, indeed, large collections of\r\nblood form beneath the skin, causing a considerable swelling.\r\n\r\nUse of the bruised part is temporarily limited. Pain, faintness, and\r\nnausea follow severe bruises, and, in case of bad bruises of the\r\nbelly, death may even ensue from damage to the viscera or to the\r\nnerves. Dangerous bleeding from large blood vessels sometimes takes\r\nplace internally, and collections of blood may later break down into\r\nabscesses. Furthermore, the bruise may be so great that the injury to\r\nmuscle and nerve may lead to permanent loss of use of the part. For\r\nthese reasons a surgeon's advice should always be sought in cases of\r\nbad bruises. Pain is present in bruises, owing to the tearing and\r\nstretching of the smaller nerve fibers, and to pressure on the nerves\r\ncaused by swelling. The swelling is produced by escape of blood and\r\nfluid from the torn blood vessels.\r\n\r\n=Treatment.=--Even slight and moderate bruises should be treated by\r\nrest of the injured part. A splint insures the rest of a limb (see\r\ntreatment of Fractures, p. 80). One of the best modes of treatment is\r\nthe snug application of a flannel bandage which secures a certain\r\namount of rest of the part to which it is applied, and aids in\r\npreventing further swelling. Where bandaging is not feasible, as in\r\ncertain parts of the body, or before bandaging in any kind of a\r\nbruise, the use of a cold compress is advisable. One layer of thin\r\ncotton or linen cloth should be wet in ice water, and should be put on\r\nthe bruised part and continually changed for newly moistened pieces\r\nas soon as the first grows warm. Alcohol and water, of each equal\r\nparts, may be used in the same manner to advantage.\r\n\r\nWhen cold is unavailable or unpleasant to the patient, several layers\r\nof cotton cloth may be wrung out in very hot water and applied to the\r\npart with frequent renewal. The value attributed to witch-hazel and\r\narnica is mainly due to the alcohol contained in their preparations.\r\nCataplasma Kaolini (U. S. P.) is an excellent remedy for simple\r\nbruises when spread thickly on the part and covered with a bandage. An\r\nointment containing twenty-five per cent of ichthyol is also a useful\r\napplication. Following severe bruises, the damaged parts should be\r\nkept warm by the use of hot-water bags, or by covering a limb with\r\ncotton wool and bandage, until such time as surgical advice may be\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nWhen the pain and swelling of bruises begin to subside, treatment\r\nshould be pursued by rubbing with liniment of ammonia or chloroform,\r\nor vaseline if these are not obtainable. Moderate exercise of the part\r\nis desirable.\r\n\r\n\r\n=ABRASIONS.=--When the surface skin is scraped off, as often happens\r\nto the shin, knee, or head, an ointment containing sixty grains of\r\nboric acid to the ounce of vaseline makes a good application, and this\r\nmay be covered with a bandage. The same ointment is useful to apply to\r\nsmall wounds and cuts after the first bandage is removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n=SPRAIN; NO DISPLACEMENT OF BONES.=\r\n\r\n_First Aid Rule 1.--Immerse in water, hot as hand can bear, for half\r\nan hour._\r\n\r\n_Rule 2.--Dry and strap with adhesive plaster, if you know how. If\r\nnot, bandage snugly, beginning with tips of fingers or with toes, and\r\nmake same pressure all the way up that you do over injury._\r\n\r\n_Rule 3.--Rest. If ankle or knee is hurt, patient must go to bed._\r\n\r\n=Conditions, Etc.=--A sprain is an injury caused by a sudden wrench or\r\ntwist of a joint, producing a momentary displacement of the ends of\r\nthe bones to such a degree that they are forced against the membrane\r\nand ligaments surrounding the joint, tearing one or both to a greater\r\nor less extent. The wrist and ankle are the joints more commonly\r\nsprained, and this injury is more likely to occur in persons with\r\nflabby muscles and relaxed ligaments, as in the so-called\r\n\"weak-ankled.\" The damage to the parts holding the joint in place may\r\nbe of any degree, from the tearing of a few fibers of the membrane\r\nenwrapping the joint to its complete rupture, together with that of\r\nthe ligaments, so that the bones are no longer in place, the joint\r\nloses its natural shape and appearance, and we have a condition known\r\nas dislocation. In a sprain then, the twist of the joint produces only\r\na temporary displacement of the bones forming the joint, sufficient to\r\ndamage the soft structures around it, but not sufficient to cause\r\nlasting displacement of the bones or dislocation.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that whether a sprain or dislocation results, depends\r\nupon the amount of injury sustained. Since it often happens that the\r\nbone entering into the joint is broken, it follows that whenever what\r\nappears to be a severe sprain occurs, with inability to move the joint\r\nand great swelling, it is important to secure surgical aid promptly.\r\nSince the discovery of the X-ray many injuries of the smaller bones of\r\nthe wrist and ankle joint, formerly diagnosed as sprains by the most\r\nskillful surgeons, have, by its use, been discovered to be breaks of\r\nthe bones which were impossible of detection by the older methods of\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\n=Symptoms.=--The symptoms of sprain are sudden, severe pain, often\r\naccompanied by faintness and nausea, swelling, tenderness, and heat of\r\nthe injured parts. The sprained joint can be only moved with pain and\r\ndifficulty. The swelling is due not so much to leaking of blood from\r\nbroken blood vessels as to filling up of the joint with fluid caused\r\nby the inflammation, although in a few days after a severe sprain the\r\nskin a little distance below the injury becomes \"black and blue\" from\r\nescape of blood caused by the injury.\r\n\r\n=Treatment.=--Since the treatment of severe sprains means first the\r\ndiscrimination between dislocation, a break of bone, and a rupture of\r\nmuscle, ligament, or tendon, it follows that the methods herein\r\ndescribed for treatment should only be employed in slight\r\nunmistakable sprains, or until a surgeon can be secured, or when one\r\nis unavailable. Nothing is better than immediate immersion of the\r\nsprained joint in as hot water as the hand can bear for half an hour.\r\nFollowing this, an elastic bandage of flannel cut on the bias about\r\nthree and one-half inches wide should be snugly applied to the limb,\r\nbeginning at the finger tips or at the toes and carrying the bandage\r\nsome distance above the injured joint.\r\n\r\nIn bandaging a part there is always danger of applying the bandage too\r\ntightly, especially if the parts swell under the bandage. If this\r\nhappens, there is increase of pain which may be followed by numbness\r\nof the limb and, what is still more significant, coldness and blueness\r\nof the extremities below the bandage, particularly of the fingers and\r\ntoes. In such cases the bandage must be removed and reapplied with\r\nless force. If the ankle or knee be sprained the patient must go to\r\nbed for at least twenty-four hours, and give the limb a complete rest.\r\n\r\nWhen the wrist or shoulder is sprained the arm should be confined in a\r\nsling. In the more serious cases the injured joint should be fixed in\r\na splint before bandaging. An injured elbow joint is held at a right\r\nangle by a pasteboard splint, a bandage, and a sling, while the knee\r\nand wrist are treated with the limb in a straight line, as far as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the knee, the splint is applied to the back of the leg;\r\nin sprained wrist, to the palm of the hand and same side of the\r\nforearm. Sheet wadding, which may be bought at any drygoods store, is\r\ntorn into strips about two inches wide and sewed together forming a\r\nbandage ten or fifteen feet long, and this is first wound about the\r\nsprained joint. Then pieces of millboard or heavy pasteboard are\r\nsoaked in water and applied while wet in long strips about three\r\ninches wide over the wadding, and the whole is covered with bandage.\r\nIn the case of the knee it is better to use a strip of wood for the\r\nsplint, reaching from the lower part of the calf to four inches above\r\nthe knee. It should be from a quarter to half an inch thick, a little\r\nnarrower than the leg, and be padded thickly with sheet wadding. It is\r\nheld in place by strips of surgeon's adhesive plaster, about two\r\ninches wide, passed around the whole circumference of the limb above\r\nand below the knee joint, and covered with bandage.\r\n\r\nIn ordinary sprains of the ankle, uncomplicated by broken bone or\r\nligament, it is possible for the patient, after resting in bed for a\r\nday, to go about on crutches, without bearing any weight on the foot\r\nuntil the third day after the accident. The treatment in the meanwhile\r\nconsists in immersing the sprained ankle alternately, first in hot\r\nwater for five minutes and then in cold water for five minutes,\r\nfollowed by rubbing of the parts about the injured joint with\r\nchloroform liniment for fifteen minutes, but not at the beginning\r\ntouching the joint itself. The rubbing should be done by an assistant\r\nvery gently the first day, with gradual increase in vigor as the days\r\npass, not only kneading the ankle but moving the joint.\r\n\r\nThis treatment should be pursued once daily, and followed by bandaging\r\nwith a flannel bandage cut on the bias three and a half inches wide.\r\nWith this method it is possible for the patient to regain the moderate\r\nuse of the ankle in about two or three weeks.\r\n\r\nThe same general line of treatment applies to the other joints;\r\npartial rest and daily bathing in hot and cold water, rubbing and\r\nmovements of the joint by an assistant. Since sprains vary in severity\r\nit follows that some may need only the first day's preliminary\r\ntreatment prescribed to effect a cure, while others may require\r\nfixation by a surgeon in a plaster-of-Paris splint for some time, with\r\nadditional treatment which only his special knowledge can supply.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: This picture shows an excellent method of fixing a\r\nsprained joint, used by Prof. Virgil P. Gibney, M.D., Surgeon-in-Chief\r\nof the N. Y. Hospital for Ruptured and Crippled. It consists of\r\nstrapping the joint by means of long, narrow strips of adhesive\r\nplaster incasing it immovably in the normal position. This procedure\r\nmay be followed by anyone who has seen a surgeon practice it.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=SYNOVITIS--Severe Injury.=--Generally of ankle or knee from fall, or\r\nshoulder from blow.\r\n\r\n_First Aid Rule 1.--Provide large pitcher of hot water and large\r\npitcher of cold water and basin. Hold joint over basin; pour hot\r\nwater slowly over joint. Return this water to pitcher. Pour cold water\r\nover joint. Return water to pitcher. Repeat with hot water again, and\r\nfollow with cold. Continue this alternation for half an hour._\r\n\r\n_Rule 2.--Put to bed, with hot-water bottles about joint, and wedge\r\nimmovably with pillows._\r\n\r\n_Rule 3.--When tenderness and heat subside, strap with adhesive\r\nplaster in overlapping strips._\r\n\r\n=Conditions, Etc.=--This condition, which may affect almost any freely\r\nmovable joints, as the knee, elbow, ankle, and hip, is commonly caused\r\nby a wrench, blow, or fall. Occasionally it comes on without any\r\napparent cause, in which case there is swelling and but slight pain or\r\ninflammation about the joint. We shall speak of synovitis of the knee\r\n(\"water on the knee\"), as that is the most common form, but these\r\nremarks will apply almost as well to the other joints. In severe cases\r\nthere are considerable pain, redness and heat, and great swelling\r\nabout the knee. The swelling is seen especially below the kneepan, on\r\neach side of the front of the joint, and also often above the kneepan.\r\nFrequently the only signs of trouble are swelling with slight pain,\r\nunless the limb is moved.\r\n\r\n=Treatment.=--If the knee is not red, hot, or tender to the touch, it\r\nwill not be necessary for the patient to remain in bed, but when these\r\nsymptoms are present a splint of some sort must be applied so that the\r\nleg is kept nearly straight, and the patient must keep to his bed\r\nuntil the heat, redness, and tenderness have subsided. In the meantime\r\neither an ice bag, hot poultice, cloths wrung out in hot water, or a\r\nhot-water bag should be kept constantly upon the knee.\r\n\r\nA convenient splint consists of heavy pasteboard wet and covered with\r\nsheet wadding (or cotton batting) shaped and affixed to the back of\r\nthe leg, from six inches below to four inches above the joint, by\r\nstrips of adhesive plaster, as shown in the illustration, and then by\r\nbandage, leaving the knee uncovered for applications. A wooden splint\r\nwell padded may be used instead.\r\n\r\nIn mild cases without much inflammation, and in others after the\r\ntenderness and heat have abated, the patient may go about if the knee\r\nis treated as follows: a pad of sheet wadding or cotton batting about\r\ntwo inches thick and five inches long and as wide as the limb is\r\nplaced in the hollow behind the knee, and then the whole leg is\r\nencircled with sheet wadding from six inches below to four inches\r\nabove the knee, covering the joint as well as the pad. Beginning now\r\nfive inches below the joint, strips of surgeon's adhesive plaster, an\r\ninch wide and long enough to more than encircle the limb, are affixed\r\nabout the leg firmly like garters so as to make considerable pressure.\r\nEach strip or garter overlaps the one below about one-third of an\r\ninch, and the whole limb is thus incased in plaster from five inches\r\nbelow the knee to a point about four inches above the joint.\r\n\r\nAn ordinary cotton bandage is then applied from below over the entire\r\nplaster bandage. When this arrangement loosens, the plaster should be\r\ntaken off and new reapplied, or a few strips may be wound about the\r\nold plaster to reenforce it. The patient may walk about with this\r\nappliance without bending the knee.\r\n\r\nWhen the swelling has nearly departed, the plaster may be removed and\r\nthe knee rubbed twice daily about the joint and the joint itself moved\r\nto and fro gently by an attendant, and then bandaged with a flannel\r\nbandage. Painting the knee with tincture of iodine in spots as large\r\nas a silver dollar is also of service at this time. The knee should\r\nnot be bent in walking until it can be moved by another person without\r\nproducing discomfort.\r\n\r\nSuch treatment may be applied to the other joints in a general way.\r\nThe elbow must be fixed by a splint as recommended for dislocation of\r\nthe joint (p. 128). The ankle is treated as advised for sprain of that\r\njoint (p. 68). When a physician can be obtained no layman is justified\r\nin attempting to treat a case of water on the knee or similar\r\naffection of other joints.\r\n\r\n\r\n=BUNION AND HOUSEMAID'S KNEE.=--Bunion is a swelling of the bursa, or\r\ncushion, at the first joint of the great toe where it joins the foot.\r\nIt may not give much trouble, or it may be hot, red, tender, and very\r\npainful. It is caused by pressure of a tight boot which also forces\r\nthe great toe toward the little toe, and thus makes the great toe\r\njoint more prominent and so the more readily injured.\r\n\r\nA somewhat similar swelling, often as large as an egg, is sometimes\r\nseen over the kneepan, more often in those who work upon their knees,\r\nhence the name housemaid's knee. The swelling may come on suddenly and\r\nbe hot, tender, and painful, or it may be slow in appearing and give\r\nlittle pain.\r\n\r\n=Treatment.=--The treatment for the painful variety of bunion and\r\nhousemaid's knee is much the same: absolute rest with the foot kept\r\nraised, and application of cloths kept constantly wet with ice or cold\r\nwater; or a thick covering of Cataplasma Kaolini (U. S. P.) may be\r\napplied until the inflammation has subsided. If the trouble is\r\nchronic, or the acute inflammation does not soon abate under the\r\ntreatment advised, the case is one for the surgeon, and sometimes\r\nrequires the knife for abscess formation. In the milder cases of\r\nbunion, wearing proper shoes whose inner border forms almost a\r\nstraight line from heel to toe, so that the great toe is not pushed\r\nover toward the little toe, and painting the bunion every few days\r\nwith tincture of iodine, until the skin begins to become sore, will\r\noften be sufficient to secure recovery.\r\n\r\n\r\n=RUN-AROUND; WHITLOW OR FELON.=--\"Run-around\" consists in an\r\ninflammation of the soft parts about the finger nail. It is more\r\ncommon in the weak, but may occur in anyone, owing to the entrance of\r\npus germs through a slight prick or abrasion which may pass unnoticed.\r\nThe condition begins with redness, heat, tenderness, swelling, and\r\npain of the flesh at the root of the nail, which extends all about the\r\nnail and may be slight and soon subside, or there may be great pain\r\nand increased swelling, with the formation of \"matter\" (pus), and\r\nresult in the loss of the nail, particularly in the weak.\r\n\r\nWhitlow or felon is a much more serious trouble. It begins generally\r\nas a painful swelling of one of the last joints of the fingers on the\r\npalm side. Among the causes are a blow, scratch, or puncture. Often\r\nthere is no apparent cause, but in some manner the germs of\r\ninflammation gain entrance. The end of the finger becomes hot and\r\ntense, and throbs with sometimes almost unbearable pain. If the\r\ninflammation is chiefly of the surface there may be much redness, but\r\nif mainly of the deeper parts the skin may be but little reddened or\r\nthe surface may be actually pale. There is usually some fever, and the\r\npain is made worse by permitting the hand to hang down. If the felon\r\nis on the little finger or thumb the inflammation is likely to extend\r\ndown into the palm of the hand, and from thence into the arm along the\r\ncourse of the tendons or sinews of the muscles. Death of the bone of\r\nthe last finger joint necessitating removal of this part, stiffness,\r\ncrippling, and distortion of the hand, or death from blood poisoning\r\nmay ensue if prompt surgical treatment is not obtained.\r\n\r\n=Treatment.=--At the very outset it may be possible to stop the\r\nprogress of the felon by keeping the finger constantly wet by means of\r\na bandage continually saturated with equal parts of alcohol and water,\r\nat night keeping it moist by covering with a piece of oil silk or\r\nrubber. Tincture of iodine painted all over the end of the finger is\r\nalso useful, and the hand should be carried in a sling by day, and\r\nslung above the head to the headboard of the bed by night. If after\r\ntwenty-four hours the pain increases, it is best to apply hot\r\npoultices to the finger, changing them as often as they cool. If the\r\nfelon has not begun to abate by the end of forty-eight hours, the end\r\nof the finger must be cut lengthwise right down to the bone by a\r\nsurgeon to prevent death of the bone or extension of the inflammation.\r\nPoultices are then continued.\r\n\r\n\"Run-around\" is treated also by iodine, cold applications, and, if\r\ninflammation continues, by hot poulticing and incision with a knife;\r\nbut poulticing is often sufficient. Attention to the general health by\r\na physician will frequently be of service.\r\n\r\n\r\n=WEEPING SINEW; GANGLION.=--This is a swelling as large as a large\r\nbean projecting from the back or front of the wrist with an elastic or\r\nhard feeling, and not painful or tender unless pressed on very hard.\r\nAfter certain movements of the hand, as in playing the piano or, for\r\nexample, in playing tennis, some discomfort may be felt. Weeping sinew\r\nsometimes interferes with some of the finer movements of the hand.\r\nThe swelling is not red or inflamed, but of the natural color of the\r\nskin. It does not continue to increase after reaching a moderate size,\r\nbut usually persists indefinitely, although occasionally disappearing\r\nwithout treatment. The swelling contains a gelatinous substance which\r\nis held in a little sac in the sheath of the tendon or sinew, but the\r\ninside of the sac does not communicate with the interior of the sheath\r\nsurrounding the tendon.\r\n\r\n=Treatment.=--This consists in suddenly exerting great pressure on the\r\nswelling with the thumb, or in striking it a sharp blow with a book by\r\nwhich the sac is broken. Its contents escape under the skin, and in\r\nmost cases become absorbed. If the swelling returns a very slight\r\nsurgical operation will permanently cure the trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n=CINDERS AND OTHER FOREIGN BODIES IN THE EYE.=[4]--Foreign bodies are\r\nmost frequently lodged on the under surface of the upper lid, although\r\nthe surface of the eyeball and the inner aspect of the lower lid\r\nshould also be carefully inspected. A drop of a two per cent solution\r\nof cocaine will render painless the manipulations. The patient should\r\nbe directed to continue looking downward, and the lashes and edge of\r\nthe lid are grasped by the forefinger and thumb of the right hand,\r\nwhile a very small pencil is gently pressed against the upper part of\r\nthe lid, and the lower part is lifted outward and upward against the\r\npencil so that it is turned inside out. The lid may be kept in this\r\nposition by a little pressure on the lashes, while the cinder, or\r\nwhatever foreign body it may be, is removed by gently sweeping it off\r\nthe mucous membrane with a fold of a soft, clean handkerchief. (See\r\nFigs. 6 and 7.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.\r\n\r\nFIG. 7.\r\n\r\nREMOVING A FOREIGN BODY FROM THE EYE.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 6 note how lashes and edge of lid are grasped by forefinger\r\nand thumb, also pencil placed against lid; in Fig. 7 lid is shown\r\nturned inside out over pencil.]\r\n\r\nHot cinders and pieces of metal may become so deeply lodged in the\r\nsurface of the eye that they cannot be removed by the method\r\nrecommended, or by using a narrow slip of clean white blotting-paper.\r\nAll such cases should be very speedily referred to a physician, and\r\nthe use of needles or other instruments should not be attempted by a\r\nlayman, lest permanent damage be done to the cornea and opacity\r\nresult. Such procedures are, of course, appropriate for an oculist,\r\nbut when it is impossible to secure medical aid for days it can be\r\nattempted without much fear, if done carefully, as more harm will\r\nresult if the offending body is left in place. It is surprising to see\r\nwhat a hole in the surface of the eye will fill up in a few days. If\r\nthe foreign body has caused a good deal of irritation before its\r\nremoval, it is best to drop into the eye a solution of boric acid (ten\r\ngrains to the ounce of water) four times daily.\r\n\r\n\r\n=FOREIGN BODIES IN THE EAR.=--Foreign bodies, as buttons, pebbles,\r\nbeans, cherry stones, coffee, etc., are frequently placed in the ear\r\nby children, and insects sometimes find their way into the ear passage\r\nand create tremendous distress by their struggles. Smooth,\r\nnonirritating bodies, as buttons, pebbles, etc., do no particular harm\r\nfor a long time, and may remain unnoticed for years. But the most\r\nserious damage not infrequently results from unskillful attempts at\r\ntheir removal by persons (even physicians unused to instrumental work\r\non the ear) who are driven to immediate and violent action on the\r\nfalse supposition that instant interference is called for. Insects, it\r\nis true, should be killed without delay by dropping into the ear sweet\r\noil, castor, linseed, or machine oil or glycerin, or even water, if\r\nthe others are not at hand, and then the insect should be removed in\r\nhalf an hour by syringing as recommended for wax (Vol. II, p. 35).\r\n\r\nTo remove solid bodies, turn the ear containing the body downward,\r\npull it outward and backward, and rub the skin just in front of the\r\nopening into the ear with the other hand, and the object may fall out.\r\n\r\nFailing in this, syringing with warm water, as for removal of wax,\r\nwhile the patient is sitting, may prove successful. The essentials of\r\ntreatment then consist, first, in keeping cool; then in killing\r\ninsects by dropping oil or water into the ear, and, if syringing\r\nproves ineffective, in using no instrumental methods in an attempt to\r\nremove the foreign body, but in awaiting such time as skilled medical\r\nservices can be obtained. If beans or seeds are not washed out by\r\nsyringing, the water may cause them to swell and produce pain. To\r\nobviate this, drop glycerin in the ear which absorbs water, and will\r\nthus shrivel the seed.\r\n\r\n\r\n=FOREIGN BODIES IN THE NOSE.=--Children often put foreign bodies in\r\ntheir noses, as shoe buttons, beans, and pebbles. They may not tell of\r\nit, and the most conspicuous symptoms are the appearance of a thick\r\ndischarge from one nostril, having a bad odor, and some obstruction to\r\nbreathing on the same side. If the foreign body can be seen, the\r\nnostril on the unobstructed side should be closed and the child made\r\nto blow out of the other one. If blowing does not remove the body it\r\nis best to secure medical aid very speedily.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[4] The Editors have deemed it advisable to repeat here the following\r\ninstructions, also occurring in Vol. II, Part I, for the removal of\r\nforeign bodies in the eye, ear, and nose, as properly coming under the\r\nhead of \"First Aid in Emergencies.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n=Fractures=\r\n\r\n_How to Tell a Broken Bone--A Simple Sling--Splints and Bandage,--A\r\nBroken Rib--Fractures of Arm, Shoulder, Hand, Hips Leg and Other\r\nParts._\r\n\r\n\r\n=BROKEN BONE; FRACTURE.=[5]\r\n\r\n_First Aid Rule 1.--Be sure bone is broken. If broken, patient can\r\nscarcely (if at all) move the part beyond the break, while attendant\r\ncan move it freely in his hands. If broken, grating of rough edges of\r\nbone may be felt by attendant but should not be sought for. If broken,\r\nlimb is generally shortened._\r\n\r\n_Rule 2.--Do not try to set bone permanently. Send at once for\r\nsurgeon._\r\n\r\n\r\n=COMPOUND FRACTURE.=\r\n\r\n_Important. If there is opening to the air from the break, because of\r\ntearing of tissues by end of bone, condition is very dangerous; first\r\ntreatment may save life, by preventing infection. Before reducing\r\nfracture, and without stirring the patient much, after scrubbing your\r\nhands very clean, note:_\r\n\r\n_First Aid Rule 1.--If hairy, shave large spot about wound._\r\n\r\n_Rule 2.--Clean large area about wound with soap and water, very\r\ngently. Then wash most thoroughly again with clean water, previously\r\nboiled and cooled. Flood wound with cool boiled water._\r\n\r\n_Rule 3.--Cover wound with absorbent cotton (or pieces of muslin)\r\nwhich has been boiled. Then attend to broken bone, as hereafter\r\ndirected, in the case of each variety of fracture._\r\n\r\n_After the bone is set, according to directions, then note:_\r\n\r\n_Rule 4.--Renew pieces of previously boiled muslin from time to time,\r\nwhen at all stained with discharges. Every day wash carefully about\r\nwound, between the splints, with cool carbolic-acid solution (one\r\nteaspoonful to a pint of hot water) before putting on the fresh\r\ncloths._\r\n\r\n\r\n=BROKEN BONES OR FRACTURES.=[6]--It frequently happens that the first\r\ntreatment of fracture devolves upon the inexperienced layman.\r\nImmediate treatment is not essential, in so far as the repair of the\r\nfracture is directly concerned, for a broken bone does not unite for\r\nseveral weeks, and if a fracture were not seen by the surgeon for a\r\nweek after its occurrence, no harm would be done, provided that the\r\nlimb were kept quiet in fair position until that time. The object of\r\nimmediate care of a broken bone is to prevent pain and avoid damage\r\nwhich would ensue if the sharp ends of the broken bone were allowed to\r\ninjure the soft tissues during movements of the broken limb.\r\n\r\nFractures are partial or complete, the former when the bone is broken\r\nonly part way through; simple, when the fracture is a mere break of\r\nthe bone, and compound, when the end of one or both fragments push\r\nthrough the skin, allowing the air with its germs to come in contact\r\nwith the wound, thus greatly increasing the danger. To be sure that a\r\nbone is broken we must consider several points. The patient has\r\nusually fallen or has received a severe blow upon the part. This is\r\nnot necessarily true, for old people often break the thigh bone at the\r\nhip joint by simply making a false step.\r\n\r\nInability to use the limb and pain first call our attention to a\r\nbroken bone. Then when we examine the seat of injury we usually notice\r\nsome deformity--the limb or bone is out of line, and there may be an\r\nunusual swelling. But to distinguish this condition from sprain or\r\nbruise, we must find that there is a new joint in the course of the\r\nbone where there ought not to be any; e. g., if the leg were broken\r\nmidway between the knee and ankle, we should feel that there was\r\napparently a new joint at this place, that there was increased\r\ncapacity for movement in the middle of the leg, and perhaps the ends\r\nof the fragments of bones could be heard or felt grating together.\r\n\r\nThese, then, are the absolute tests of a broken bone--unusual mobility\r\n(or capacity for movement) in the course of the bone, and grating of\r\nthe broken fragments together. The last will not occur, of course,\r\nunless the fragments happen to lie so that they touch each other and\r\nshould not be sought for. In the case of limbs, sudden shortening of\r\nthe broken member from overlapping of the fragments is a sure sign.\r\n\r\n\r\n=SPECIAL FRACTURES.=\r\n\r\n=BROKEN RIB.=--_First Aid Rule.--Patient puts hands on head while\r\nattendant puts adhesive-plaster band, one foot wide, around injured\r\nside from spine over breastbone to line of armpit of sound side. Then\r\nput patient to bed._\r\n\r\nA rib is usually broken by direct violence. The symptoms are pain on\r\ntaking a deep breath, or on coughing, together with a small, very\r\ntender point. The deformity is not usually great, if, indeed, any\r\nexists, so that nothing in the external appearance may call the\r\nattention to fracture. Grating between the fragments may be heard by\r\nthe patient or by the examiner, and the patient can often place his\r\nfinger on the exact location of the break.\r\n\r\nWhen it is a matter of doubt whether a rib is broken or not the\r\ntreatment for broken rib should be followed for relief of pain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF BANDAGING BROKEN RIB (SCUDDER).\r\n\r\nNote manner of sticking one end of wide adhesive plaster along\r\nbackbone; also assistant carrying strip around injured side.]\r\n\r\n=Treatment= consists in applying a wide band of surgeon's adhesive\r\nplaster, to be obtained at any drug shop. The band is made by\r\noverlapping strips four or five inches wide, till a width of one foot\r\nis obtained. This is then applied by sticking one end along the back\r\nbone and carrying it forward around the injured side of the chest over\r\nthe breastbone as far as a line below the armpit on the uninjured side\r\nof the chest, i. e., three-quarters way about the chest. These four-\r\nor five-inch strips of plaster may be cut the right length first and\r\nlaid together, overlapping about two inches, and put on as a whole,\r\nor, what is easier, each strip may be put on separately, beginning at\r\nthe spine, five inches below the fracture, and continuing to apply the\r\nstrips, overlapping each other about two inches, until the band is\r\nmade to extend to about five inches above the point of fracture, all\r\nthe strips ending in the line of the armpit of the uninjured side.\r\n(Fig. 8.)\r\n\r\nIf surgeon's plaster cannot be obtained, a strong unbleached cotton or\r\nflannel bandage, a foot wide, should be placed all around the chest\r\nand fastened as snugly as possible with safety pins, in order to limit\r\nthe motion of the chest wall. The patient will often be more\r\ncomfortable sitting up, and should take care not to be exposed to cold\r\nor wet for some weeks, as pleurisy or pneumonia may follow. Three\r\nweeks are required for firm union to be established in broken ribs.\r\n\r\n\r\n=COLLAR-BONE FRACTURE.=\r\n\r\n_First Aid Rule.--Put patient flat on back, on level bed, with small\r\npillow between his shoulders; place forearm of injured side across\r\nchest, and retain it so with bandage about chest and arm._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.\r\n\r\nA BROKEN COLLAR BONE (SCUDDER).\r\n\r\nUsual attitude of patient with a fracture of this kind; note lowering\r\nand narrowed appearance of left shoulder.]\r\n\r\nFracture of the collar bone is one of the commonest accidents. The\r\nbone is usually broken in the middle third. A swelling often appears\r\nat this point, and there is pain there, especially on lifting the arm\r\nup and away from the body. It will be noticed that the shoulder, on\r\nthe side of the injury, seems narrower and also lower than its fellow.\r\nThe head is often bent toward the injured side, and the arm of the\r\nsame side is grasped below the elbow by the other hand of the patient\r\nand supported as in a sling. (See Fig. 9.) In examining an apparently\r\nbroken bone _the utmost gentleness may be used_ or serious damage may\r\nresult.\r\n\r\n=Treatment.=--The best treatment consists in rest in bed on a hard\r\nmattress; the patient lying flat on the back with a small pillow\r\nbetween the shoulders and the forearm of the injured side across the\r\nchest. This is a wearisome process, as it takes from two to three\r\nweeks to secure repair of the break. On the other hand, if the forearm\r\nis carried in a sling, so as to raise and support the shoulder, while\r\nthe patient walks about, a serviceable result is usually obtained; the\r\nonly drawback being that an unsightly swelling remains at the seat of\r\nthe break. To make a sling, a piece of strong cotton cloth a yard\r\nsquare should be cut diagonally from corner to corner, making two\r\nright-angled triangles. Each of these will make a properly shaped\r\npiece for a sling. (See Figs. 10 and 11.)\r\n\r\nFracture of the collar bone happens very often in little children,\r\nand is commonly only a partial break or splitting of the bone, not\r\nextending wholly through the shaft so as to divide it into two\r\nfragments, but causing little more than bending of the bone (the\r\n\"green-stick fracture\").\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.\r\n\r\nHOW TO MAKE A SLING (SCUDDER).\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 10 note three-cornered bandage; No. 2 end is carried over\r\nright shoulder, No. 1 over left, then both fastened behind neck; No. 3\r\nbrought over and pinned.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.\r\n\r\nHOW TO MAKE A SLING (SCUDDER).\r\n\r\nThe above illustration shows sling in position. It is made of cotton\r\ncloth a yard square cut diagonally from corner to corner.]\r\n\r\nA fall from a chair or bed is sufficient to cause the accident. A\r\nchild generally cries out on movement of the arm of the injured side,\r\nor on being lifted by placing the hands under the armpits of the\r\npatient. A tender swelling is seen at the point of the injury of the\r\ncollar bone. A broad cotton band, with straps over the shoulders to\r\nkeep it up, should encircle the body and upper arm of the injured\r\nside, and the hand of the same side should be supported by a narrow\r\nsling fastened above behind the neck.\r\n\r\n\r\n=LOWER-JAW FRACTURE.=\r\n\r\n_First Aid Rule.--Put fragments into place with your fingers, securing\r\ngood line of his teeth. Support lower jaw by firmly bandaging it\r\nagainst upper jaw, mouth shut, using four-tailed bandage. (Fig. 12.)_\r\n\r\nFracture of the lower jaw is caused by a direct blow. It involves the\r\npart of the jaw occupied by the lower teeth, and is more apt to occur\r\nin the middle line in front, or a short distance to one side of this\r\npoint. The force causing the break usually not only breaks the bone,\r\nbut also tears the gum through into the mouth, making a compound\r\nfracture. There is immediate swelling of the gum at the point of\r\ninjury, and bleeding. The mouth can be opened with difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the teeth is the most important point to observe.\r\nOwing to displacement of the fragments there is a difference in the\r\nlevel of the teeth or line of the teeth, or both, at the place where\r\nthe fracture occurs. Also one or more of the teeth are usually\r\nloosened at this point. In addition, unusual movement of the\r\nfragments may be detected as well as a grating sound on manipulation.\r\n\r\n=Treatment.=--The broken fragments should be pressed into place with\r\nthe fingers, and retained temporarily with a four-tailed bandage, as\r\nshown in the cut. Feeding is done through a glass tube, using milk,\r\nbroths, and thin gruels. A mouth wash should be employed four times\r\ndaily, to keep the mouth clean and assist in healing of the gum. A\r\nconvenient preparation consists of menthol, one-half grain; thymol,\r\none-half grain; boric acid, twenty grains; water, eight ounces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.\r\n\r\nBANDAGE FOR A BROKEN JAW (AMERICAN TEXT-BOOK).\r\n\r\nAbove cut shows a four-tailed bandage; note method of tying; one strip\r\nsupports lower jaw; the other holds it in place against upper jaw.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=SHOULDER-BLADE FRACTURE.=\r\n\r\n_First Aid Rule.--There is no displacement. Bandage fingers, forearm,\r\nand arm of affected side, and put this arm in sling. Fasten slung arm\r\nto body with many turns of a bandage, which holds forearm against\r\nchest and arm against side._\r\n\r\nShoulder-blade fracture occasions pain, swelling, and tenderness on\r\npressure over the point of injury. On manipulating the bone a grating\r\nsound may be heard and unnatural motion detected. The treatment\r\nconsists in bandaging the forearm and arm on the injured side from\r\nbelow upward, beginning at the wrist; slinging the forearm bent at a\r\nright angle across the front of the body, suspended by a narrow sling\r\nfrom the neck, and then encircling the body and arm of the injured\r\nside from shoulder to elbow with a wide bandage applied under the\r\nsling, which holds the arm snugly against the side. This bandage is\r\nprevented from slipping down by straps attached to it and carried over\r\neach shoulder.\r\n\r\n\r\n=ARM FRACTURE.=\r\n\r\n_First Aid Rule.--Pad two pieces of thin board nine by three inches\r\nwith handkerchiefs. Carefully pull fragments of bone apart, grasping\r\nlower fragment near elbow while assistant pulls gently on upper\r\nfragment near shoulder. Put padded boards (splints) one each side of\r\nthe fracture, and wind bandage about their whole length, tightly\r\nenough to keep bony fragments firm in position. Put forearm and hand\r\nin sling._\r\n\r\nIn fracture of the arm between the shoulder and elbow, swelling and\r\nshortening may give rise to deformity. Pain and abnormal motion are\r\nsymptoms, while a grating sound may be detected, but manipulation of\r\nthe arm for this purpose should be avoided. The surface is apt soon to\r\nbecome black and blue, owing to rupture of the blood vessels beneath\r\nthe skin.\r\n\r\nThe hand and forearm should be bandaged from below upward to the\r\nelbow. The bone is put in place by grasping the patient's elbow and\r\npulling directly down in line with the arm, which is held slightly\r\naway from the side of the patient, while an assistant steadies and\r\npulls up the shoulder. Then a wedge-shaped pad, long enough to reach\r\nfrom the patient's armpit to his elbow (made of cotton wadding or\r\nblanketing sewed in a cotton case) and about four inches wide and\r\nthree inches thick at one end, tapering up to a point at the other, is\r\nplaced against the patient's side with the tapering end uppermost in\r\nthe armpit and the thick end down. This pad is kept in place by a\r\nstrip of surgeon's adhesive plaster, or bandage passing through the\r\nsmall end of the wedge, and brought up and fastened over the shoulder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.\r\n\r\nFIG. 14.\r\n\r\nBANDAGE FOR BROKEN ARM (SCUDDER).\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 13 note splints secured by adhesive plaster; also pad in\r\narmpit; in Fig. 14 see wide bandage around body; also sling.]\r\n\r\nWhile the arm is pulled down from the shoulder, three strips of\r\nwell-padded tin or thin board (such as picture-frame backing) two\r\ninches wide and long enough to reach from shoulder to elbow, are laid\r\nagainst the front, outside, and back of the arm, and secured by\r\nencircling strips of surgeon's plaster or bandage. The arm is then\r\nbrought into the pad lying against the side under the armpit, and is\r\nheld there firmly by a wide bandage surrounding the arm and entire\r\nchest, and reaching from the shoulder to elbow. It is prevented from\r\nslipping by strips of cotton cloth, which are placed over the\r\nshoulders and pinned behind and before to the top of the bandage. The\r\nwrist is then supported in a sling, not over two inches wide, with the\r\nforearm carried in a horizontal position across the front of the body.\r\nFirm union of the broken arm takes place usually in from four to six\r\nweeks. (See Figs. 13 and 14.)\r\n\r\n\r\n=FOREARM FRACTURE.=\r\n\r\n_First Aid Rule.--Set bones in proper place by pulling steadily on\r\nwrist while assistant holds back the upper part of the forearm. If\r\nunsuccessful, leave it for surgeon to reduce after \"period of\r\ninaction\" comes, a few days later, when swelling subsides. If\r\nsuccessful, put padded splints (pieces of cigar box padded with\r\nhandkerchiefs) one on each side, front and back, and wind a bandage\r\nabout whole thing to hold it immovably._\r\n\r\nTwo bones enter into the structure of the forearm. One or both of\r\nthese may be broken. The fracture may be simple or compound,[7] when\r\nthe soft parts are damaged and the break of the bone communicates with\r\nthe air, the ends of the bone even projecting through the skin.\r\n\r\nIn fracture of both bones there is marked deformity, caused by\r\ndisplacement of the broken fragments, and unusual motion may be\r\ndiscovered; a grating sound may also be detected but, as stated\r\nbefore, manipulation of the arm should be avoided.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.\r\n\r\nSETTING A BROKEN FOREARM (SCUDDER).\r\n\r\nSee manner of holding arm and applying adhesive plaster strips; one\r\nsplint is shown, another is placed back of hand and forearm.]\r\n\r\nWhen only one bone is broken the signs are not so marked, but there is\r\nusually a very tender point at the seat of the fracture, and an\r\nirregularity of the surface of the bone may be felt at this point. If\r\nfalse motion and a grating sound can also be elicited, the condition\r\nis clear. The broken bones are put into their proper place by the\r\noperator who pulls steadily on the wrist, while an assistant grasps\r\nthe upper part of the forearm and pulls the other way. The ends of the\r\nfragments are at the same time pressed into place by the other hand of\r\nthe operator, so that the proper straight line of the limb is\r\nrestored.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.\r\n\r\nFRACTURE OF BOTH BONES IN FOREARM (SCUDDER).\r\n\r\nThis cut shows the position and length of the two padded splints; also\r\nmethod of applying adhesive plaster.]\r\n\r\nAfter the forearm is set, it should be held steadily in the following\r\nposition while the splints are applied. The elbow is bent so that the\r\nforearm is held at right angles with the arm horizontally across the\r\nfront of the chest with the hand extended, open palm toward the body\r\nand thumb uppermost. The splints, two in number, are made of wood\r\nabout one-quarter inch thick, and one-quarter inch wider than the\r\nforearm. They should be long enough to reach from about two inches\r\nbelow the elbow to the root of the fingers. They are covered smoothly\r\nwith cotton wadding, cotton wool, or other soft material, and then\r\nwith a bandage. The splints are applied to the forearm in the\r\npositions described, one to the back of the hand and forearm, and the\r\nother to the palm of the hand and front of the forearm.\r\n\r\nUsually there are spaces in the palm of the hand and front of the\r\nwrist requiring to be filled with extra padding in addition to that on\r\nthe splint. The splints are bound together and to the forearm by three\r\nstrips of surgeon's adhesive plaster or bandage, about two inches\r\nwide. One strip is wound about the upper ends of the splints, one is\r\nwrapped about them above the wrist, and the third surrounds the back\r\nof the hand and palm, binding the splints together below the thumb.\r\nThe splints should be held firmly in place, but great care should be\r\nexercised to use no more force in applying the adhesive plaster or\r\nbandage than is necessary to accomplish this end, as it is easy to\r\nstop the circulation by pressure in this part. There should be some\r\nspring felt when the splints are pressed together after their\r\napplication. A bandage is to be applied over the splints and strips of\r\nplaster, beginning at the wrist and covering the forearm to the elbow,\r\nusing the same care not to put the bandage on too firmly. The forearm\r\nis then to be held in the same position by a wide sling, as shown\r\nabove. (See Figs. 15, 16, 17.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.\r\n\r\nDRESSING FOR BROKEN FOREARM (SCUDDER).\r\n\r\nProper position of arm in sling; note that hand is unsupported with\r\npalm turned inward and thumb uppermost.]\r\n\r\nFour weeks are required to secure firm union after this fracture. When\r\nthe fracture is compound the same treatment should be employed as\r\ndescribed under Compound Fracture of Leg, p. 116.\r\n\r\n\r\n=FRACTURE OF THE WRIST; COLLES'S FRACTURE.=--This is a break of the\r\nlower end of the bone on the thumb side of the wrist, and much the\r\nlarger bone in this part of the forearm. The accident happens when a\r\nperson falls and strikes on the palm of the hand; it is more common in\r\nelderly people. A peculiar deformity results. A hump or swelling\r\nappears on the back of the wrist, and a deep crease is seen just above\r\nthe hand in front. The whole hand is also displaced at the wrist\r\ntoward the thumb side.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.\r\n\r\nA BROKEN WRIST (SCUDDER).\r\n\r\nCharacteristic appearance of a \"Colles's fracture\"; note backward\r\ndisplacement of hand at wrist; also fork-shaped deformity.]\r\n\r\nIt is not usual to be able to detect abnormal motion in the case of\r\nthis fracture, or to hear any grating sound on manipulating the part,\r\nas the ends of the fragments are generally so jammed together that\r\nit is necessary to secure a surgeon as soon as possible to pull them\r\napart under ether, in order to remedy the existing \"silver-fork\"\r\ndeformity. (See Figs. 18, 19, 20, 21, 22.)\r\n\r\n=Treatment.=--Until medical aid can be obtained the same sort of\r\nsplints should be applied, and in the same way as for the treatment of\r\nfractured forearm. If the deformity is not relieved a stiff and\r\npainful joint usually persists. It is sometimes impossible for the\r\nmost skillful surgeon entirely to correct the existing deformity, and\r\nin elderly people some stiffness and pain in the wrist and fingers are\r\noften unavoidable results.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.\r\n\r\nFIG. 20.\r\n\r\nFIG. 21.\r\n\r\nFIG. 22.\r\n\r\nFRACTURE OF THE WRIST (SCUDDER).\r\n\r\nAbove illustrations show deformities resulting from a broken wrist;\r\nFigs. 19 and 20 the crease at base of thumb; Fig. 21 hump on back of\r\nwrist; Fig. 22 twisted appearance of hand.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=FRACTURE OF BONE OF HAND, OR FINGER.=\r\n\r\n_First Aid Rule.--Set fragments of bone in place by pulling with one\r\nhand on finger, while pressing fragments into position with other\r\nhand. Put on each side of bone a splint made of cigar box, padded with\r\nfolded handkerchiefs, and retain in place with bandage wound about\r\nsnugly. Put forearm and hand in sling._\r\n\r\nThis accident more commonly happens to the bones corresponding to the\r\nmiddle and ring finger, and occurs between the knuckle and the wrist,\r\nappearing as a swelling on the back of the hand. On looking at the\r\nclosed fist it will be seen that the knuckle corresponding to the\r\nbroken bone in the back of the hand has ceased to be prominent, and\r\nhas sunken down below the level of its fellows. The end of the\r\nfragment nearer the wrist can generally be felt sticking up in the\r\nback of the hand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.\r\n\r\nA BROKEN FINGER (SCUDDER).\r\n\r\nNote splint extending from wrist to tip of finger; also manner of\r\napplying adhesive plaster strips and pad in palm.]\r\n\r\nIf the finger corresponding to the broken bone in the back of the hand\r\nbe pulled on forcibly, and the fragments be held between the thumb and\r\nforefinger of the other hand of the operator, pain and abnormal\r\nmotion may be detected, and the ends of the broken bone pressed into\r\nplace. A thin wooden splint, as a piece of cigar box, about an inch\r\nwide at base and tapering to the width of the finger should be applied\r\nto the palm of the hand extending from the wrist to a little beyond\r\nthe finger tip, secured by strips of adhesive plaster, as in the cut,\r\nand covered by a bandage. The splint should be well padded, and an\r\nadditional pad should be placed in the palm of the hand over the point\r\nof fracture. Three weeks are required for firm union, and the hand\r\nshould not be used for a month.\r\n\r\nIt is usually easy to recognize a broken bone in a finger, unless the\r\nbreak is near a joint, when it may be mistaken for a dislocation.\r\nPain, abnormal motion, and grating between the fragments are observed.\r\n\r\nIf there is deformity, it may be corrected by pulling on the injured\r\nfinger with one hand, while with the other the fragments are pressed\r\ninto line. A narrow, padded wooden or tin splint is applied, as in the\r\ncut (p. 102), reaching from the middle of the palm to the finger tip.\r\nAny existing displacement of the broken bone can be relieved by using\r\npressure with little pads of cotton held in place by narrow strips of\r\nadhesive plaster where it is needed to keep the bone in line. The\r\nsplint may be removed in two weeks and a strip of adhesive plaster\r\nwound about the finger to support it for a week or two more.\r\n\r\nIn fracture of the thumb, the splint is applied along the back instead\r\nof on the palm side.\r\n\r\n\r\n=HIP FRACTURE.=\r\n\r\n_First Aid Rule.--Put patient flat on back in bed, with limb wedged\r\nbetween pillows till surgeon arrives._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.\r\n\r\nTREATING A BROKEN HIP (SCUDDER).\r\n\r\nNote the manner of straightening leg and getting broken bone into\r\nline; also assistant carefully steadying the thigh.]\r\n\r\nA fracture of the hip is really a break of that portion of the thigh\r\nbone which enters into the socket of the pelvic bone and forms the hip\r\njoint. It occurs most commonly in aged people as a result of so slight\r\nan accident as tripping on a rug, or in falling on the floor from the\r\nstanding position, making a misstep, or while attempting to avoid a\r\nfall. When the accident has occurred the patient is unable to rise or\r\nwalk, and suffers pain in the hip joint. When he has been helped to\r\nbed it will be seen that the foot of the injured side is turned out,\r\nand the leg is perhaps apparently shorter than its fellow. There is\r\npain on movement of the limb, and the patient cannot raise his heel,\r\non the injured side, from the bed. Shortening is an important sign.\r\n\r\nWith the patient lying flat on the back and both legs together in a\r\nstraight line with the body, measurements from each hip-bone are made\r\nwith a tape to the bony prominence on the inside of each ankle, in\r\nturn. One end of the tape is held at the navel and the other is swung\r\nfrom one ankle to the other, comparing the length of the two limbs.\r\nShortening of less than half an inch is of no importance as a sign of\r\nfracture. The fragments of broken bone are often jammed together\r\n(impacted) so that it is impossible to get any sound of grating\r\nbetween them, and it is very unwise to manipulate the leg or hip\r\njoint, except in the gentlest manner, in an attempt to get this\r\ngrating. If the ends of the fragments become disengaged from each\r\nother it often happens that union of the break never occurs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT FOR FRACTURED HIP (SCUDDER).\r\n\r\nNote method of holding splints in place with muslin strips; one above\r\nankle, one below and one above knee, one in middle and one around\r\nupper part of thigh.]\r\n\r\nThe treatment simply consists in keeping the patient quiet on a hard\r\nmattress, with a small pillow under the knee of the injured side and\r\nthe limb steadied on either side by pillows or cushions until a\r\nsurgeon can be obtained. (See Thigh-bone Fracture.)\r\n\r\n\r\n=THIGH-BONE FRACTURE.=\r\n\r\n_First Aid Rule.--Prepare long piece of thin board which will reach\r\nfrom armpit to ankle, and another piece long enough to reach from\r\ncrotch to knee, and pad each with folded towels or blanket._\r\n\r\n_While one assistant holds body back, and another assistant pulls on\r\nankle of injured side, see that the fragments are separated and\r\nbrought into good line, and then apply the splints, assistants still\r\npulling steadily, and fasten the splints in place with bandage, or by\r\ntying several cloths across at three places above the knee and two\r\nplaces below the knee._\r\n\r\n_Finally, pass a wide band of cloth about the body, from armpit to\r\nhips, inclosing the upper part of the well-padded splint, and fasten\r\nit snugly. The hollow between splint and waist must be filled with\r\npadding before this wide cloth is applied._\r\n\r\nIn fracture of the thigh bone (between the hip and knee), there is\r\noften great swelling about the break. The limb is helpless and\r\nuseless. There is intense pain and abnormal position in the injured\r\npart, besides deformity produced by the swelling. The foot of the\r\ninjured limb is turned over to one side or the other, owing to a\r\nrolling over of the portion of the limb below the break. With both\r\nlower limbs in line with the body, and the patient lying on the back,\r\nmeasurements are made from each hip-bone to the prominence on the\r\ninside of either ankle joint. Shortening of the injured leg will be\r\nfound, varying from one to over two inches, according to the\r\noverlapping and displacement of the fragments.\r\n\r\n=Treatment.=--To set this fracture temporarily, a board about five\r\ninches wide and long enough to reach from the armpit to the foot\r\nshould be padded well with towels, sheets, shawls, coats, blanket, or\r\nwhatever is at hand, and the padding can best be kept in place by\r\nsurgeon's adhesive plaster, bicycle tape, or strips of cloth.[8]\r\nAnother splint should be provided as wide as the thigh and long enough\r\nto reach along the back of the leg from the middle of the calf to the\r\nbuttock, and also padded in the same way. A third splint should be\r\nprepared in the same manner to go inside the leg, reaching from the\r\ncrotch to the inside of the foot. Still a fourth splint made of a thin\r\nboard as wide as the thigh, extending from the upper part of the thigh\r\nto just above the knee, is padded for application to the front of the\r\nthigh.\r\n\r\nWhen these are made ready and at hand, the leg should be pulled on\r\nsteadily but carefully straight away from the body to relax the\r\nmuscles, an assistant holding the upper part of the thigh and pulling\r\nin the opposite direction. Then, when the leg has been straightened\r\nout and the thigh bone seems in fair line, the splints should be\r\napplied; the first to the outside of the thigh and body, the second\r\nunder the calf, knee, and thigh; the third to the inside of the whole\r\nlimb, and the fourth to the front of the thigh.\r\n\r\nWide pads should be placed over the ribs under the outside splint to\r\nfill the space above the hips and under the armpit. Then all four\r\nsplints are drawn together and held in place by rubber-plaster straps\r\nor strips of strong muslin applied as follows: one above the ankle;\r\none below the knee; one above the knee; one in the middle of the\r\nthigh, and one around the upper part of the thigh. A wide band of\r\nstrong muslin or sheeting should then be bound around the whole body\r\nbetween the armpits and hips, inclosing the upper part of the outside\r\nsplint. The patient can then be borne comfortably upon a stretcher\r\nmade of boards and a mattress or some improvised cushion. (See Figs.\r\n24 and 25.)\r\n\r\nWhen the patient can be put immediately to bed after the injury, and\r\ndoes not have to be transported, it is only necessary to apply the\r\nouter, back, and front splints, omitting the inner splint. It is\r\nnecessary for the proper and permanent setting of a fractured thigh\r\nthat a surgeon give an anaesthetic and apply the splints while the\r\nmuscles are completely relaxed. It is also essential that the muscles\r\nbe kept from contracting thereafter by the application of a fifteen-\r\nor twenty-pound weight to the leg, after the splints are applied, but\r\nit is possible to outline here only the proper first-aid treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n=KNEEPAN FRACTURE.=\r\n\r\n_First Aid Rule.--Pain is immediate and intense. Separated fragments\r\nmay be felt at first. Swelling prompt and enormous. Even if not sure,\r\nfollow these directions for safety._\r\n\r\n_Prepare splint: thin board, four inches wide, and long enough to\r\nreach from upper part of thigh to just above ankle. Pad with folded\r\npiece of blanket or soft towels. Place it behind leg and thigh;\r\ncarefully fill space behind knee with pad; fasten splint to limb with\r\nthree strips of broad adhesive plaster, one around upper end of\r\nsplint, one around lower end, one just below knee._\r\n\r\n_Lay large flat, dry sponge over knee thus held, and bandage this in\r\nplace. Keep sponge and bandage wet with ice water. If no sponge is\r\navailable, half fill rubber hot-water bottle with cracked ice, and lay\r\nthis over knee joint. Put patient to bed._\r\n\r\nFracture of kneepan is caused either by direct violence or muscular\r\nstrain. It more frequently occurs in young adults. Immediate pain is\r\nfelt in the knee and walking becomes impossible; in fact, often the\r\npatient cannot rise from the ground after the accident. Swelling at\r\nfirst is slight, but increases enormously within a few hours.\r\nImmediately after the injury it may be possible to feel the separate\r\nbroken fragments of the kneepan and to recognize that they are\r\nseparated by a considerable space if the break is horizontally across\r\nthe bone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.\r\n\r\nA BROKEN KNEEPAN (SCUDDER).\r\n\r\nA padded splint, supporting knee, is shown reaching from ankle to\r\nthigh. Note number and location of adhesive plaster strips.]\r\n\r\nNothing can be done to set the fracture until the swelling about the\r\njoint has been reduced, so that the first treatment consists in\r\nsecuring immediate rest for the kneejoint, and immobility of the\r\nfragments. A splint made of board, about a quarter of an inch thick\r\nand about four inches wide for an adult, reaching from the upper part\r\nof the thigh above to a little above the ankle below, is applied to\r\nthe back of the limb and well padded, especially to fill the space\r\nbehind the knee. The splint is attached to the limb by straps of\r\nadhesive plaster two inches and a half wide; one around the lower end\r\nof the splint, one around the upper part, and the third placed just\r\nbelow the knee. To prevent and arrest the swelling and pain, pressure\r\nis then made on the knee by bandaging.\r\n\r\nOne of the best methods (Scudder's) is to bind a large, flat, dry\r\nsponge over the knee and then keep it wet with cold water; or to apply\r\nan ice bag directly to the swollen knee; a splint in either case being\r\nthe first requisite. The patient should of course be put to bed as\r\nsoon as possible after the accident, and should lie on the back with\r\nthe injured leg elevated on a pillow with a cradle to keep the clothes\r\nfrom pressing on the injured limb. (See cut, p. 110.)\r\n\r\n\r\n=FRACTURE OF LEG BONES, BETWEEN KNEE AND ANKLE.=\r\n\r\n_First Aid Rule.--Handle very carefully; great danger of making\r\nopening to surface. Special painful point, angle or new joint in bone,\r\ndisability, and grating felt will decide existence of break. Let\r\nassistant pull on foot, to separate fragments, while you examine part\r\nof supposed break. If only one bone is broken, there may be no\r\ndisplacement._\r\n\r\n_Put patient on back. While two assistants pull, one on ankle and one\r\non thigh at knee, thus separating fragments, slide pillow lengthwise\r\nunder knee, and, bringing its edges up about leg, pin them snugly\r\nabove leg._\r\n\r\n_Prepare three pieces of thin wood, four inches wide and long enough\r\nto reach from sole of foot to a point four inches above knee. While\r\nassistants pull on limb again, as before, put one splint each side\r\nand third behind limb, and with bandage or strips of sticking plaster\r\nfasten these splints to the leg inclosed in its pillow as tight as\r\npossible._\r\n\r\nIn fracture of the leg between the knee and ankle we have pain,\r\nangular deformity or an apparent false joint in the leg, swelling and\r\ntenderness over the seat of fracture, together with inability to use\r\nthe injured leg. Two bones form the framework of the leg; the inner,\r\nor shinbone, the sharp edge of which can be felt in front throughout\r\nmost of its course, being much the larger and stronger bone. When both\r\nbones are broken, the displacement of the fragments, abnormal motion\r\nand consequent deformity, are commonly apparent, and a grating sound\r\nmay be heard, but should not be sought for.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.\r\n\r\nFRACTURE OF BOTH LEG BONES (SCUDDER).\r\n\r\nThis cut shows the peculiar deformity in breaks of this kind; see\r\nposition of kneepan; also prominence of broken bone above ankle.]\r\n\r\nAn open wound often communicates with the break, making the fracture\r\ncompound, a much more serious condition. To avoid making the fracture\r\na compound one, during examination of the leg, owing to the sharp\r\nends of the bony fragments, the utmost gentleness should be used.\r\nUnder no circumstances attempt to move the fragments from side to\r\nside, or backward and forward, in an effort to detect the grating\r\nsound often caused by the ends of broken bones. The greatest danger\r\nlies in the desire to do too much. We again refer the reader to First\r\nAid Rule 1.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.\r\n\r\nBANDAGE FOR BROKEN LEG (SCUDDER).\r\n\r\nNote the pillow brought up around leg and edges pinned together; also\r\nlength and method of fastening splint with straps.]\r\n\r\nWhen one bone is broken there may be only a point of tenderness and\r\nswelling about the vicinity of the break and no displacement or\r\ngrating sound. When in doubt as to the existence of a fracture always\r\ntreat the limb as if a fracture were present. \"Black and blue\"\r\ndiscoloration of the skin much more extensive than that following\r\nsprain will become evident over the whole leg within twenty-four\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n=Treatment.=--When a surgeon cannot be obtained, the following\r\ntemporary pillowdressing, recommended by Scudder in his book on\r\nfractures, is one of the best. With the patient on his back, the leg\r\nhaving been straightened and any deformity removed as far as possible\r\nby grasping the foot and pulling directly away from the body while an\r\nassistant steadies the thigh, a large, soft pillow, inclosed in a\r\npillowcase, is placed under the leg. The sides of the pillow are\r\nbrought well up about the leg and the edges of the pillowcase are\r\npinned together along the front of the leg.\r\n\r\nThen three strips of wood about four inches wide, three-sixteenths to\r\na quarter of an inch thick, and long enough to reach from the sole of\r\nthe foot to about four inches above the knee, are placed outside of\r\nthe pillow along the inner and outer aspects of the leg and beneath\r\nit. The splints are held in place, with the pillow as padding beneath,\r\nby four straps of webbing (or if these cannot be obtained, by strips\r\nof stout cloth, adhesive plaster, or even rope); but four pads made of\r\nfolded towels should be put under the straps where they cross the\r\nfront of the leg where little but the pillowcase overlaps. These\r\nstraps are applied thus: one above the knee, one above the ankle, and\r\nthe other two between these two points, holding all firmly together.\r\nThis dressing may be left undisturbed for a week or even ten days if\r\nnecessary. (See Figs. 27 and 28.)\r\n\r\nThe leg should be kept elevated after the splints are applied, and\r\nsteadied by pillows placed either side of it. From one to two months\r\nare required to secure union in a broken leg in adults, and from three\r\nto five months elapse before the limb is completely serviceable. In\r\nchildren the time requisite for a cure is usually much shorter.\r\n\r\n\r\n=ANKLE-JOINT FRACTURE.=\r\n\r\n_First Aid Rule.--One or both bones of leg may be broken just above\r\nankle. Foot is generally pushed or bent outward. Prepare two pieces of\r\nthin wood, four inches wide and long enough to go from sole of foot to\r\njust below knee:--the splints. Pad them with folded towels or pieces\r\nof blanket._\r\n\r\n_While assistants pull bones apart gently, one pulling on knee, other\r\npulling on foot and turning it straight, apply the splints, one each\r\nside of the leg._\r\n\r\nA fracture of the ankle joint is really a fracture of the lower\r\nextremities of the bones of the leg. There are present pain and great\r\nswelling, particularly on the inner side of the ankle at first, and\r\nthe whole foot is pushed and bent outward. The bony prominence on the\r\ninner side of the ankle is unduly marked. The foot besides being bent\r\noutward is also displaced backward on the leg. This fracture might be\r\ntaken for a dislocation or sprain of the ankle. Dislocation of the\r\nankle without fracture is very rare, and when the foot is returned to\r\nits proper position it will stay there, while in fracture the foot\r\ndrops back to its former displaced state. In sprained ankle there are\r\npain and swelling, but not the deformity caused by the displacement of\r\nthe foot.\r\n\r\nThis fracture may be treated temporarily by returning the foot to its\r\nusual position and putting on side splints and a back splint, as\r\ndescribed for the treatment of fracture of the leg.\r\n\r\n\r\n=COMPOUND OR OPEN FRACTURE OF THE LEG.=--This condition may be\r\nproduced either by the violence which caused the fracture also leading\r\nto destruction of the skin and soft parts beneath, or by the end of a\r\nbony fragment piercing the muscles and skin from within. In either\r\nevent the result is much more serious than that of an ordinary simple\r\nfracture, for germs can gain entrance through the wound in the skin\r\nand cause inflammation with partial destruction or death of the part.\r\n\r\n=Treatment.=--Immediate treatment is here of the utmost value. It is\r\napplicable to open or compound fracture in any part of the body. The\r\narea for a considerable distance about the wound, if covered with\r\nhair, should be shaved. It should then be washed with warm water and\r\nsoap by means of a clean piece of cotton cloth or absorbent cotton.\r\nThen some absorbent cotton or cotton cloth should be boiled in water\r\nin a clean vessel for a few minutes, and, after the operator has\r\nthoroughly washed his hands, the boiled water (when sufficiently cool)\r\nshould be applied to the wounded area and surrounding parts with the\r\nboiled cotton, removing in the most painstaking way all visible and\r\ninvisible dirt. By allowing some of the water to flow over the wound\r\nfrom the height of a few feet this result is favored. Finally some of\r\nthe boiled cotton, which has not been previously touched, is spread\r\nover the wound wet, and covered with clean, dry cotton and bandaged.\r\n\r\nSplints are then applied as for simple fracture in the same locality\r\n(p. 113). If a fragment of bone projects through the wound it may be\r\nreplaced after the cleansing just described, by grasping the lower\r\npart of the limb and pulling in a straight line of the limb away from\r\nthe body, while an assistant holds firmly the upper part of the limb\r\nand pulls in the opposite direction. During the whole process neither\r\nthe hands of the operator nor the boiled cotton should come in contact\r\nwith anything except the vessel containing the boiled water and the\r\npatient.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[5] The engravings illustrating the chapters on \"Fractures\" and\r\n\"Dislocations\" are from Buck's \"Reference Handbook of Medical\r\nScience,\" published by William Wood & Co., New York; also, Scudder's\r\n\"Treatment of Fractures\" and \"American Text-Book of Surgery,\"\r\npublished by W.

A\r\ndislocation is commonly described as a condition in which a part (as\r\nthe shoulder) is \"out of joint\" or \"out of place.\" A dislocation must\r\nbe distinguished from a sprain, and from a fracture near a joint. In a\r\nsprain, as has been stated (p. 65), the bones entering into the\r\nformation of the joint are perhaps momentarily displaced, but return\r\ninto their proper place when the violence is removed. But, owing to\r\ngreater injury, in dislocation the head of the bone slips out of the\r\nsocket which should hold it, breaks through the ligaments surrounding\r\nthe joint, and remains permanently out of place. For this reason there\r\nis a peculiar deformity, produced by the head of the bone's lying in\r\nits new and unnatural situation, which is not seen in a sprain.\r\n\r\nAlso, the dislocated joint cannot be moved by the patient or by\r\nanother person, except within narrow limits, while a sprained joint\r\ncan be moved, with the production of pain it is true, but without any\r\nmechanical obstacle. In the case of fracture near a joint there is\r\nusually increased movement in some new direction. When a dislocated\r\njoint is put in proper place it stays in place, whereas when a\r\nfractured part is reduced there is nothing to keep it in place and, if\r\nlet alone, it quickly resumes its former faulty position.\r\n\r\nOnly a few of the commoner dislocations will be considered here, as\r\nthe others are of rare occurrence and require more skill than can be\r\nimparted in a book intended for the laity. The following instructions\r\nare not to be followed if skilled surgical attendance can be secured;\r\nthey are intended solely for those not so fortunately situated.\r\n\r\n\r\n=DISLOCATION OF THE JAW.=--This condition is caused by a blow on the\r\nchin, or occurs in gaping or when the mouth is kept widely open during\r\nprolonged dental operations. The joint surface at the upper part of\r\nthe lower jaw, just in front of the entrance to the ear, is thrown out\r\nof its socket on one side of the face, or on both sides. If the jaw is\r\nput out of place on both sides at once, the chin will be found\r\nprojecting so that lower front teeth jut out beyond the upper front\r\nteeth, the mouth is open and cannot be closed, and the patient is\r\nsuffering considerable pain. When the jaw is dislocated on one side\r\nonly, the chin is pushed over toward the uninjured side of the face,\r\nwhich gives the face a twisted appearance; the mouth is partly open\r\nand fixed in that position. A depression is seen on the injured side\r\nin front of the ear, while a corresponding prominence exists on the\r\nopposite side of the face, and the lower front teeth project beyond\r\nthe upper front teeth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.\r\n\r\nREDUCING DISLOCATION OF JAW (AMERICAN TEXT-BOOK).\r\n\r\nThumbs placed upon last molar teeth on each side; note jaw grasped\r\nbetween fingers and thumbs to force it into place.]\r\n\r\n=Treatment.=--A dislocation of one side of the jaw is treated in the\r\nsame manner as that of both sides.\r\n\r\nThe dislocation may sometimes be reduced by placing a good-sized cork\r\nas far back as possible between the back teeth of the upper and lower\r\njaws (on one or both sides, according as the jaw is out of place on\r\none or both sides), and getting the patient to bite down on the cork.\r\nThis may pry the jaw back into place.\r\n\r\nThe common method is for the operator to protect both thumbs by\r\nwrapping bandage about his thumbs, or wearing leather gloves, and\r\nthen, while an assistant steadies the head, the operator presses\r\ndownward and backward on the back teeth of the patient on each side of\r\nthe lower jaw with both thumbs in the patient's mouth, while the chin\r\nis grasped beneath by the forefingers of each hand and raised upward.\r\nWhen the jaw slips into place it should be maintained there by a\r\nbandage placed around the head under the chin and retained there for a\r\nweek. During this time the patient should be fed on liquids through a\r\ntube, so that it will not be necessary for him to open his mouth to\r\nany extent. (See Fig. 29.)\r\n\r\n\r\n=DISLOCATION OF THE SHOULDER.=--This is by far the most common of\r\ndislocations in adults, constituting over one-half of all such\r\naccidents affecting any of the joints. It is caused by a fall or blow\r\non the upper arm or shoulder, or by falling upon the elbow or\r\noutstretched hand. The upper part (or head) of the bone of the arm\r\n(humerus) slips downward out of the socket or, in some cases, inward\r\nand forward. In either case the general appearance and treatment of\r\nthe accident are much the same. The shoulder of the injured side loses\r\nits fullness and looks flatter in front and on the side. The arm is\r\nheld with the elbow a few inches away from the side, and the line of\r\nthe arm is seen to slope inwardly toward the shoulder, as compared\r\nwith the sound arm.\r\n\r\nThe injured arm cannot be moved much by the patient, although it can\r\nbe lifted up and away from the side by another person, but cannot be\r\nmoved so that, with the elbow against the front of the chest, the hand\r\nof the injured arm can be laid on the opposite shoulder. Neither can\r\nthe arm, with the elbow at a right angle, be made to touch the side\r\nwith the elbow, without causing great pain.\r\n\r\n=Treatment.=--One of the simplest methods (Stimson's) of reducing this\r\ndislocation consists in placing the patient on his injured side on a\r\ncanvas cot, which should be raised high enough from the floor on\r\nchairs, and allowing the injured arm to hang directly downward toward\r\nthe floor through a hole cut in the cot, the hand not touching the\r\nfloor. Then a ten-pound weight is attached to the wrist. The gradual\r\npull produced by this means generally brings the shoulder back into\r\nplace without pain and within six minutes. (Fig. 30.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.\r\n\r\nTREATING A DISLOCATED SHOULDER.\r\n\r\n(REFERENCE HANDBOOK.)\r\n\r\nPatient lying on injured side; note arm hanging through hole in cot\r\nraised from floor on chairs; also weight attached to wrist.]\r\n\r\nThe more ordinary method consists in putting the patient on his back\r\non the floor, the operator also sitting on the floor with his\r\nstockinged foot against the patient's side under the armpit of the\r\ninjured shoulder and grasping the injured arm at the elbow, he pulls\r\nthe arm directly outward (i. e., with the arm at right angles with the\r\nbody) and away from the trunk. An assistant may at the same time aid\r\nby lifting the head of the arm bone upward with his fingers in the\r\npatient's armpit and his thumbs over the injured shoulder.\r\n\r\nIf the arm does not go into place easily by one of these methods it is\r\nunwise to continue making further attempts. Also if the shoulder has\r\nbeen dislocated several days, or if the patient is very muscular, it\r\nwill generally be necessary that a surgeon give ether in order to\r\nreduce the dislocation. It is entirely possible for a skillful surgeon\r\nto secure reduction of a dislocation of the shoulder several weeks\r\nafter its occurrence. After the dislocation has been relieved the arm,\r\nabove the elbow, should be bandaged to the side of the chest and the\r\nhand of the injured side carried in a sling for ten days.\r\n\r\n\r\n=DISLOCATION OF THE ELBOW.=--This is more frequent in children, and is\r\nusually produced by a fall on the outstretched hand. The elbow is\r\nthrown out of joint, so that the forearm is displaced backward on the\r\narm, in the more usual form of dislocation. The elbow joint is swollen\r\nand generally held slightly bent, but cannot be moved to any extent\r\nwithout great pain. The tip of the elbow projects at the back of the\r\njoint more than usual, while at the front of the arm the distance\r\nbetween the wrist and the bend of the elbow is less than that of the\r\nsound arm. (See cut, p. 126.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.\r\n\r\nAbove cut shows characteristic appearance of a dislocated shoulder;\r\nnote loss of fullness; also elbow held away from side and inward\r\nsloping of arm.\r\n\r\nFIG. 32.\r\n\r\nDISLOCATED ELBOW AND SHOULDER.\r\n\r\n(AMERICAN TEXT-BOOK.)\r\n\r\nFig. 32 shows dislocation of elbow backward; note swollen condition of\r\nleft elbow held slightly bent; also the projection of back of joint.]\r\n\r\nFor further proof that the elbow is out of joint we must compare the\r\nrelations of three points in each elbow. These are the two bony\r\nprominences on each side of the joint (belonging to the bone of the\r\narm above the elbow) and the bony prominence that forms the tip of the\r\nelbow which belongs to the bone of the forearm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF DISLOCATED ELBOW (SCUDDER).\r\n\r\nNote padded right-angled tin splint; also three strips of surgeon's\r\nplaster on arm and forearm.]\r\n\r\nIn dislocation backward of the forearm, the tip of the elbow is\r\nobserved to be farther back, in relation to the two bony prominences\r\nat the side of the joint, than is the case in the sound elbow. This is\r\nbest ascertained by touching the three points on the patient's elbow\r\nof each arm in turn with the thumb and middle finger on each of the\r\nprominences on the side of the joint, while the forefinger is placed\r\non the tip of the elbow. The lower end of the bone of the upper arm\r\nis often seen and felt very easily just above the bend of the elbow in\r\nfront, as it is thrown forward (see Fig. 32, p. 126).\r\n\r\nFracture of the lower part of the bone of the arm above the elbow\r\njoint may present much the same appearance as the dislocation we are\r\ndescribing, but then the whole elbow is displaced backward, and the\r\nrelation of the three points described above is the same in the\r\ninjured as in the uninjured arm. Moreover in fracture the deformity,\r\nwhen relieved, will immediately recur when the arm is released, as\r\nthere is nothing to hold the bones in place; but in dislocation, after\r\nthe bones are replaced in their normal position, the deformity will\r\nnot reappear.\r\n\r\n=Treatment.=--The treatment for dislocation consists in bending the\r\nforearm backward to a straight line, or even a little more, and then\r\nwhile an assistant holds firmly the arm above the elbow, the forearm\r\nshould be grasped below the elbow and pulled with great force away\r\nfrom the assistant and, while exerting this traction, the elbow is\r\nsuddenly bent forward to a right angle, when the bones should slip\r\ninto place.\r\n\r\nThe after treatment is much the same as for most fractures of the\r\nelbow. The arm is retained in a well-padded right-angled tin splint\r\nwhich is applied with three strips of surgeon's plaster and bandage to\r\nthe front of the arm and forearm (see Fig. 33) for two or three weeks.\r\nThe splint should be removed every few days, and the elbow joint\r\nshould be moved to and fro gently to prevent stiffness, and the\r\nsplint then reapplied.\r\n\r\n\r\n=DISLOCATION OF THE HIP.=--This occurs more commonly in males from\r\nfifteen to forty-five years of age, and is due to external violence.\r\nIn the more ordinary form of hip dislocation the patient stands on the\r\nsound leg with the body bent forward, the injured leg being greatly\r\nshortened, with the toes turned inward so much that the foot of the\r\ninjured limb crosses over the instep of the sound foot. The injured\r\nlimb cannot be moved outward and but slightly inward, yet may be bent\r\nforward. Walking is impossible. Pain and deformity of the hip joint\r\nare evident.\r\n\r\nThe only condition with which this would be likely to be confused is a\r\nfracture of bone in the region of the hip. Fracture of the hip is\r\ncommon in old people, but not in youth or middle adult life. In\r\nfracture there is usually not enough shortening to be perceived with\r\nthe eye; the toes are more often turned out, and the patient can often\r\nbear some weight on the limb and even walk.\r\n\r\n=Treatment.=--The simplest treatment is that recommended by Stimson,\r\nas follows: the patient is to be slung up in the air in a vertical\r\nposition by means of a sheet or belt of some sort placed around the\r\nbody under the armpits, so that the feet dangle a foot or so from the\r\nfloor, and then a weight of about ten or fifteen pounds, according to\r\nthe strength of the patient's muscles, is attached to the foot of the\r\ninjured leg (bricks, flatirons, or stones may be used), and this\r\nweight will usually draw the bone down into its socket within ten or\r\nfifteen minutes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.\r\n\r\nREDUCING DISLOCATION OF HIP (REFERENCE HANDBOOK).\r\n\r\nPatient lying on table; uninjured leg held by assistant; leg of\r\ndislocated side at right angles; note weight at bend of knee.]\r\n\r\nOr the patient may assume the position shown in the accompanying cut,\r\nlying prone upon a table with the uninjured leg held horizontally by\r\none person, while another, with the injured thigh held vertically and\r\nleg at right angles, grasps the patient's ankle and moves it gently\r\nfrom side to side after placing a five-to ten-pound sand bag, or\r\nsimilar weight of other substance, at the flexure of the knee. When\r\nthe dislocation has been overcome the patient should stay in bed for a\r\nweek or two and then go about gradually on crutches for two weeks\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\n\r\n=SURGICAL DRESSINGS.=--Sterilized gauze is the chief surgical dressing\r\nof the present day. This material is simply cheese cloth, from which\r\ngrease and dirt have been removed by boiling in some alkaline\r\npreparation, usually washing soda, and rinsing in pure water. The\r\ngauze is sterilized by subjecting it to moist or dry heat. Sterilized\r\ngauze may be bought at shops dealing in surgeons' supplies and\r\ninstruments, and at most drug stores. Gauze or cheese cloth may be\r\nsterilized (to destroy germs) by baking in a slow oven, in tin boxes,\r\nor wrapped in cotton cloth, until it begins to turn brown. It is well\r\nto have a small piece of the gauze in a separate package, which may be\r\ninspected from time to time in order to see how the baking is\r\nprogressing, as the material to be employed for surgical purposes\r\nshould not be opened until just before it is to be used, any remainder\r\nbeing immediately covered again. Cut the gauze into pieces as large as\r\nthe hand, before it is sterilized, to avoid cutting and handling\r\nafterwards. Gauze may also be sterilized by steaming in an Arnold\r\nsterilizer, such as is used for milk, or by boiling, if it is to be\r\napplied wet. Carbolized, borated, and corrosive-sublimate gauze have\r\nlittle special value.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE I.\r\n\r\nFig. I.\r\n\r\nFig. II.\r\n\r\nFig. III.\r\n\r\nFig. IV.\r\n\r\nAPPLYING A ROLLER BANDAGE (REFERENCE HANDBOOK).\r\n\r\nFig. I shows method of starting a spiral bandage; Fig. II, ready to\r\nreverse; Fig. III, the reverse completed; Fig. IV shows spica bandage\r\napplied to groin.]\r\n\r\nAbsorbent cotton is also employed as a surgical dressing, and should\r\nalso be sterilized if it is to be used on raw surfaces. It is not so\r\nuseful for dressing wounds as gauze, since it mats down closely, does\r\nnot absorb secretions and discharges so well, and sticks to the parts.\r\nWhen torn into balls as large as an egg and boiled for fifteen minutes\r\nin water, it is useful as sponges for cleaning wounds. Sheet wadding,\r\nor cotton, is serviceable in covering splints before they are applied\r\nto the skin. Wet antiseptic surgical dressings are valuable in\r\ntreating wounds which are inflamed and not healing well. They are made\r\nby soaking gauze in solutions of carbolic acid (half a teaspoonful of\r\nthe acid to one pint of hot water), and, after application, covering\r\nthe gauze with oil silk, rubber dam, or paraffin paper. Heavy brown\r\nwrapping paper, well oiled or greased, will answer the purpose when\r\nbetter material is not at hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n=BANDAGES.=--Bandaging is an art that can only be acquired in any\r\ndegree of perfection by practical instruction and experience. Some\r\nuseful hints, however, may be given to the inexperienced. Cotton\r\ncloth, bleached or unbleached, is commonly employed for bandages; also\r\ngauze, which does not make so effective a dressing, but is much\r\neasier of application, is softer and more comfortable, and is best\r\nadapted to the use of the novice. A bandage cannot be put on properly\r\nunless it is first rolled. A bandage for the limbs should be about two\r\nand a half inches wide and eight yards long; for the fingers,\r\nthree-quarters of an inch wide and three yards long. The bandage may\r\nbe rolled on itself till it is as large as the finger, and then rolled\r\ndown the front of the thigh, with the palm of the right hand, while\r\nthe loose end is held taut in the left hand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE II.\r\n\r\nFig. I.\r\n\r\nFig. II.\r\n\r\nFig. III.\r\n\r\nFig. IV.\r\n\r\nDIFFERENT FORMS OF BANDAGES.\r\n\r\n(AMERICAN TEXT-BOOK AND REFERENCE HANDBOOK.)\r\n\r\nFig. I shows application of figure-of-eight bandage; Fig. II, a spica\r\nbandage of thumb; Fig. III, a spica bandage of foot; Fig. IV, a\r\nT-bandage.]\r\n\r\nTwo forms of bandages are adapted to the limbs, the figure-of-eight,\r\nand the spiral reversed bandage. In applying a bandage always begin at\r\nthe lower extremity of the limb and approach the body. Make a few\r\ncircular turns about the limb (see Fig. I, p. 132), then as the limb\r\nenlarges, draw the bandage up spirally, reversing it each time it\r\nencircles the limb, as shown in Fig. I, p. 134. In reversing, hold the\r\nbandage with the left thumb so that it will not slip, and then\r\nallowing the free end to fall slack, turn down as in Fig. II, p. 132.\r\n\r\nThe T-bandage is used to bandage the crotch between the thighs, or\r\naround the forehead and over the top of the skull. (See Fig. IV, p.\r\n134.) In the former case, the ends 1-1 are put about the body as a\r\nbelt, and the end 2 is brought from behind, in the narrow part of the\r\nback, down forward between the thighs, over the crotch, and up to the\r\nbelt in the lower part of the belly. The figure-of-eight bandage is\r\nused on various parts, and is illustrated in the bandage called spica\r\nof the groin, Fig. IV, p. 132. Beginning with a few circular turns\r\nabout the body in the direction of 1, the bandage is brought down in\r\nfront of the body and groin, as in 2, and then about the back of the\r\nthigh up around the front of the thigh, as in 3, across the back and\r\nonce around the body and down again as in 2. Other bandages\r\nappropriate to various parts of the body are also illustrated that by\r\ntheir help the proper method of their application may be understood.\r\nSee pages 132, 134, 136, 137. The triangular bandage (see p. 88) made\r\nfrom a large handkerchief or piece of muslin a yard square, cut or\r\nfolded diagonally from corner to corner, will be found invaluable in\r\nemergency cases. It is easily and quickly adjusted to almost any part\r\nof the body, and may be used for dressing wounds, or as a bandage for\r\nfractures, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE III.\r\n\r\nFig. I.\r\n\r\nFig. II.\r\n\r\nBANDAGES FOR EXTREMITIES (AMERICAN TEXT-BOOK).\r\n\r\nFig. I shows a spiral reversed bandage of arm and hand, requiring\r\nroller 2-1/2 inches wide and 7 yards long; Fig. II shows a spiral\r\nreversed bandage of leg and foot, requiring roller 2-1/2 inches wide\r\nand 14 yards long.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE IV.\r\n\r\nFig. I.\r\n\r\nFig. II.\r\n\r\nFig. III.\r\n\r\nFig. IV.\r\n\r\nBANDAGES FOR HEAD AND HAND.\r\n\r\n(AMERICAN TEXT-BOOK.)\r\n\r\nFig. I shows a gauntlet bandage; Fig. II, a circular bandage for the\r\njaw; Fig. III, a circular bandage for the head; Fig. IV, a\r\nfigure-of-eight bandage for both eyes.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n=Ordinary Poisons=\r\n\r\n_Unknown Poisons--Antidotes for Poisoning by Acids and Alkalies--The\r\nStomach Pump--Emetics--Symptoms and Treatment of Metal Poisoning--\r\nNarcotics._\r\n\r\n\r\n_First Aid Rule 1.--Send at once for physician._\r\n\r\n_Rule 2.--Empty stomach with emetic._\r\n\r\n_Rule 3.--Give antidote._\r\n\r\nIn most cases of poisoning emetics and purgatives do the most good.\r\n\r\n\r\n=UNKNOWN POISONS.=--Act at once before making inquiry or\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\n_First Aid Rule.--Give two teaspoonfuls of chalk (or whiting, or\r\nwhitewash scraped from the wall or a fence) mixed with a wineglass of\r\nwater.

Give, if possible, a hypodermic of a thirtieth of a grain\r\nof strychnine, every two hours, or as he may require it, to keep the\r\npulse full and strong. Use hot-water bottles to feet and legs.\r\n\r\n_Phenacetin; Acetanilid; Headache Powders:_ Give two teaspoonfuls of\r\nwhisky in a wineglass of hot water. If the heart flags, give tincture\r\nof digitalis, five minims in tablespoonful of water, every two hours,\r\nor till three doses are given. It is better to use digitalin, one\r\none-hundredth of a grain hypodermically, if possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n=Food Poisoning=\r\n\r\n_Food Containing Bacterial Poisons Resulting from Putrefaction; Food\r\nInfected with Disease Germs; Food Containing Parasites--Tapeworm--\r\nTrichiniasis--Potato Poisoning._\r\n\r\n\r\n=FOOD POISONING.=--Much the same symptoms from all meats, fish,\r\nshellfish, milk, cheese, ice cream, and vegetables; namely, vomiting,\r\ncramps, diarrhea, headache, prostration, weak pulse, cold hands and\r\nfeet, possibly an eruption.\r\n\r\n_First Aid Rule 1.--Rid patient of poison. Cause repeated vomiting by\r\ngiving three or four glasses of warm water, each containing half a\r\nlevel teaspoonful of mustard. Put finger down throat to assist. Empty\r\nbowels by giving warm injection of soapsuds and water by fountain\r\nsyringe._\r\n\r\n_Rule 2.--Support heart and rally nerve force. Give teaspoonful of\r\nwhisky in tablespoonful of hot water every half hour, as needed. Put\r\nhot-water bottles at feet and about body._\r\n\r\n=Conditions, Etc.=--Bacterial poisons, constituting irritants of the\r\nstomach and bowels, are found in certain mussels, oysters from\r\nartificial beds, eels out of stagnant ditches--as well as the uncooked\r\nblood of the common river eel--certain fish at all times, certain fish\r\nwhen spawning, putrefied fish, fermented canned fish, sausages of\r\nwhich the ingredients have putrefied, putrefied meat, imperfectly\r\ncured bacon, putrefied cheese, milk improperly handled and not cooled\r\nbefore being transported, ice cream which fermented before freezing,\r\nor ice cream containing putrid gelatin, and mouldy corn meal and the\r\nbread made from it.\r\n\r\nThese poisons are called toxins, or toxalbumins, or bacterial\r\nproteids. They are no longer called ptomaines, because many ptomaines\r\nare not poisonous. They are formed within the cells of the bacteria,\r\nand result from the combination of certain constituents of the food\r\nmaterial that nourishes the bacteria, in some way not quite\r\nunderstood. Some decomposition must have taken place in the food\r\nbefore it can furnish to the bacteria the nourishment it needs. If\r\nthis has happened, the bacteria multiply rapidly, and the toxins that\r\nare formed are taken up by the lymphatics and carried away from the\r\ntissues as fast as possible. But so great is their virulence that they\r\nact on several vital organs before they can be antagonized by the\r\nnatural elements of the blood.\r\n\r\n=Symptoms.=--The symptoms are much the same in all the cases of\r\nbacterial poisoning mentioned. Sudden and violent vomiting and\r\ndiarrhea appear a few hours after eating the spoiled food, or may be\r\ndelayed. There may be headache, colic, and cramps in the muscles.\r\nMarked prostration and weak pulse with cold hands and feet are\r\ncharacteristic. The appearance of skin eruptions is not uncommon. The\r\noccurrence of such symptoms in several persons, some hours after\r\npartaking of the same food, is sufficient to warrant one in\r\npronouncing the trouble food poisoning.\r\n\r\n=Treatment.=--The objects of treatment are to rid the patient of the\r\npoison, and to stimulate the heart and general circulation, and draw\r\non the reserve nerve force. It is best to procure medical aid to wash\r\nout the stomach, but when this is impossible, the patient should be\r\nencouraged to swallow plenty of tepid water and then vomit it. If\r\nthere is no natural inclination to do so, vomiting may be brought\r\nabout by putting the finger in the back of the throat. The same\r\nprocess should be repeated a number of times, and the result will be\r\nalmost as good as though a physician had used a stomach tube. A\r\nteaspoonful of salt or tablespoonful of mustard in the water will\r\nhasten its rejection. Then the bowels should likewise be emptied. If\r\nvomiting continues this will not be possible by means of drugs given\r\nby the mouth, although calomel may be retained given in half-grain\r\ntablets hourly to an adult, until the bowels begin to move, or till\r\neight to ten tablets are taken. When vomiting is excessive, emptying\r\nof the bowels may be brought about quickly by giving warm injections\r\nof soapsuds into the bowel with a fountain syringe. Brandy or whisky\r\nin teaspoonful doses given in a tablespoonful of hot water at\r\nhalf-hour intervals should follow the emptying of the stomach and\r\nbowels, and the patient must be kept quiet. He must also be kept warm\r\nby means of hot-water bags and blankets.\r\n\r\n\r\n=INFECTED FOOD.=--A frequent source of illness is infection by disease\r\ngerms transmitted in food. The meat of animals slaughtered when sick\r\nwith abscess, pneumonia, kidney disease, diarrhea, or anthrax\r\n(malignant pustule) carries disease germs and causes serious illness;\r\nso does the meat of animals killed after recent birth of their young,\r\nand probably having fever. Oysters may be contaminated with excrement\r\nfrom typhoid patients, and may then transmit the disease to those who\r\neat them.\r\n\r\nMilk from diseased animals, or contaminated with germs of typhoid\r\nfever, scarlet fever, tuberculosis, diphtheria, etc., is apt to cause\r\nthe same disease in the human being who drinks it.\r\n\r\nIf such infected food is eaten raw, the diseases with which it is\r\ncontaminated may be transmitted. If subjected to cooking at a\r\ntemperature of at least the boiling point, comparative safety is\r\nsecured; but the toxins accompanying the disease germs in the infected\r\nfood are not as a rule rendered harmless. Treatment must be directed\r\nto each disease thus transmitted.\r\n\r\nPoisoning resulting from eating canned meats has sometimes been\r\nattributed to supposed traces of tin, zinc, or solder, which have\r\nbecome dissolved in the fluids of the meat, but in the vast majority\r\nof cases such poisoning is due to toxins accompanying the germs of\r\nputrefaction, the meats having been unfit for canning at the outset.\r\nIn such cases the symptoms are the same as in other food poisoning,\r\nand the treatment must be such as is elsewhere directed (see pp. 147\r\nand 149).\r\n\r\nWhile human breast milk is germ free, the cows' milk sold in cities is\r\na very common source of disease. Scrupulous care of the cows, of the\r\nclothing and hands of the milkers, of the stables at which the herds\r\nare quartered, and of the cans, pails, and pans used, reduces to a\r\nminimum the amount of filth and impurity otherwise mixed with milk. In\r\nthe household, as well as during transportation, milk should be kept\r\ncool, with ice if necessary. It should also never be left uncovered,\r\nfor it readily absorbs gases, effluvia, and contaminating substances\r\nin the air, and affords an excellent medium for the growth and\r\npropagation of germs. When partially or entirely soured, it should not\r\nbe used, except in the preparation of articles of food by cooking, as\r\ndirected in cook books. It should never be used if there is any doubt\r\nabout its purity. Unless all doubt has been removed, it is best to\r\nsubject milk intended for children's consumption to a temperature of\r\n160 deg. F. for ten minutes, and then put it on the ice, especially during\r\nhot weather. Germs are thus rendered harmless, and the nourishing\r\nqualities of the milk remain unimpaired.\r\n\r\nSummer diarrhea of children, also called cholera infantum, occurs as\r\nan epidemic in almost all large cities during the hottest days of\r\nsummer. The disease is largely fatal, especially during the first hot\r\nmonth, because the most susceptible and tender children are the first\r\naffected. It is due to the absorption into the systems of these\r\nchildren of the toxins formed during the putrefying of milk in the\r\nstomachs and bowels of the little sufferers. Clean, pure sweet milk,\r\nfree from bacteria should be used to prevent the occurrence of this\r\ndisease. Its treatment is outlined in Vol. III. Exactly what bacteria\r\ncause the disease is not decided. Possibly the milk is infected, but\r\nprobably the poisonous results come from toxins.\r\n\r\n\r\n=FOOD CONTAINING PARASITES.=--The parasites found in food in this\r\ncountry are echinococcus, guineaworm, hookworm, trichina, and\r\ntapeworm. Echinococcus cannot be understood or diagnosed by the\r\nlayman. Guineaworm is excessively rare in the United States; it gains\r\naccess into the body through drinking water which contains the\r\nindividuals. Hookworm is the cause of \"miners' anaemia,\" and is\r\nextremely rare in this country.\r\n\r\nThe entrance of living food parasites can be absolutely prevented by\r\nthorough cooking of meats, especially pork and beef. Heat destroys the\r\n\"measles\" and the trichina worms.\r\n\r\n\r\n=TAPEWORM.=--This is developed in man after eating \"measly\" beef or\r\npork. \"Measles\" are embryo tapeworms called, from their appearance,\r\n\"bladder worms.\" In from six to ten weeks after being received into\r\nthe intestine of a man, these bladder worms become full grown, and\r\nmeasure from ten to thirty feet in length--the tapeworms.\r\n\r\n=Symptoms.=--Vertigo, impairment of sight and of hearing, itching of\r\nthe nose, salivation, loss of appetite, dyspepsia, emaciation, colic,\r\npalpitation of the heart, and sometimes fainting accompany the\r\npresence of the tapeworm. Generally the condition becomes known\r\nthrough the passage in the excrement of small sections of the worm.\r\nThese sections resemble flat portions of macaroni.\r\n\r\n=Treatment.=--This, to be successful, must be directed by a physician.\r\nWhen no physician can be procured, the patient may attempt his own\r\nrelief. After fasting for twenty-four hours, pumpkin seed, from which\r\nthe outer coverings have been removed by crushing, are soaked\r\novernight in water and taken on an empty stomach in the morning; a\r\nchild takes one or two ounces thoroughly mashed and mixed with sirup\r\nor honey, and an adult four ounces (see Vol. III, p. 245).\r\n\r\n\r\n=TRICHINIASIS.=--This is a dangerous disease caused by the presence in\r\nthe muscles and other tissues of the trichinae, little worms which are\r\nswallowed in raw or partly cooked pork, ham, or bacon. Nausea,\r\nvomiting, colic, and diarrhea appear early, generally on the second\r\nday after eating the infected meat. Later, stiffness of the muscles\r\noccurs, with great tenderness, swelling of the face and of the\r\nextremities, sweating, hoarseness, difficult breathing, inability to\r\nsleep, bronchitis, and pneumonia.\r\n\r\nThere is no treatment for the disease. Many cases which are not fatal\r\nare probably considered to be obscure rheumatism. Many cases of\r\npneumonia are caused by the worm.\r\n\r\n\r\n=POTATO POISONING.=--There remains one variety of food poisoning which\r\nneeds mention, since it occurs when least expected, and when proper\r\nfood has been subjected to natural growth. As the potato belongs to\r\nthe botanical family containing the dangerous belladonna, tobacco,\r\nhyoscyamus, and stramonium, it is not surprising that is should also\r\ncontain a powerful poisonous alkaloid, namely, solanine. Solanine is\r\ndeveloped in potatoes, especially during their sprouting stage.\r\nViolent vomiting and diarrhea and inflammation of the stomach and\r\nbowels are caused by it. Careful peeling of sprouting potatoes, and\r\nremoval of their eyes, will lessen, if not wholly obviate, the danger\r\nfrom eating them. This form of food poisoning is rare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n=Bites and Stings=\r\n\r\n_Several Kinds of Mosquitoes--Cause of Yellow Fever--Bee, Wasp, and\r\nHornet Stings--Wood Ticks, Lice, and Fleas--Scorpions and\r\nCentipedes--Poisonous Snakes--Dog and Cat Bites._\r\n\r\n\r\n=MOSQUITOES.=--The female mosquito is the offender. During or after\r\nsucking blood she injects a poison into the body which causes itching,\r\nswelling, and, in some susceptible persons, considerable inflammation\r\nof the skin. The bites of the mosquitoes living on the shores of the\r\nArctic Ocean and in the tropics are the most virulent. The most\r\nimportant relation of mosquitoes to man was only recently discovered.\r\nThey are probably the sole cause of malaria and yellow fever in the\r\nhuman being. The malarial parasite which lives in the blood of man,\r\nwhen he is suffering from malaria, first inhabits the body of a\r\ncertain kind of mosquito. The mosquito acquires the undeveloped\r\nparasite by biting the human malarial patient, and then acts as a\r\nmedium of infection by transmitting the active parasite to some\r\nhealthy man, through the bite.\r\n\r\nThe more common house mosquito, the Culex, does not carry the parasite\r\nof malaria, and it is important to be able to distinguish the\r\nAnopheles which is the source of malaria. The Anopheles is more common\r\nin the country, while the Culex is a city pest. The Culex has very\r\nshort palpi, the name given to the projections parallel to the\r\nproboscis; while those of Anopheles are so large that it appears to\r\nhave three probosces. There are no markings on the wings of the\r\nordinary species of Culex, while the wings of Anopheles are distinctly\r\nmottled. The Culex, sitting on a wall or ceiling, holds its hind legs\r\nabove its back and its body nearly parallel to the wall or ceiling,\r\nbut the Anopheles carries its hind legs either against the wall or\r\nhanging down (rarely above the back), and its body, instead of lying\r\nparallel to the wall or ceiling, hangs away at an angle of about\r\nforty-five degrees from it.\r\n\r\nThe Culex lays her eggs in sinks, tanks, cisterns, and water about\r\nhouses, but the Anopheles deposits her ova in shallow pools and\r\nsluggish streams, especially those on which is a growth of green scum\r\nor algae. Such are the main distinguishing features of the\r\nmalaria-carrying mosquito, the Anopheles, and the commoner house\r\nvariety, the Culex.\r\n\r\nTo prevent malaria, mosquito bites must be prevented by nettings in\r\nhouses, especially for the protection of sleepers. Pools, ponds, and\r\nmarshy districts must be drained in order to destroy the breeding\r\nplaces of Anopheles, and in the malarial season, petroleum (kerosene)\r\nmust be poured on the surface of such waters to arrest the development\r\nof the immature insects (larvae).\r\n\r\nThe mosquito is believed to be the sole cause of yellow fever, being\r\ncapable of communicating the germ of the disease to man by its bite\r\ntwo weeks after it has itself been contaminated with the germ in\r\nfeeding on the blood of a yellow-fever patient. This invaluable\r\ndiscovery was made by Dr. Walter Reed, U. S. A., in 1901, as a result\r\nof his labors and those of other members of the yellow-fever\r\ncommission of the U. S. Army in Cuba, involving the death of one of\r\nthe members of the commission (Dr. Lazear), and utilizing the heroism\r\nof a number of our young soldiers who voluntarily offered themselves\r\nto be bitten by mosquitoes that had previously bitten yellow-fever\r\npatients, and who experimentally occupied premises containing all\r\nsorts of articles infected by yellow-fever patients. The result of\r\ntheir research proves that yellow fever is not contagious at all, in\r\nthe usual sense, but is communicated only through the medium of\r\nmosquitoes. This shows the fallacy of many quarantine rules regarding\r\nyellow-fever patients, and of the fear of nursing the sick, and will\r\nresult in controlling the disease.\r\n\r\nIn the case of malaria or yellow fever, there is a vicious circle into\r\nwhich man and the mosquito enter; malaria and yellow-fever patients\r\ncontaminate the mosquitoes which bite them, and the mosquitoes in\r\ntheir turn infect man with these diseases. A patient with malaria\r\ncoming into a nonmalarial place, and being bitten by mosquitoes, may\r\nlead to an epidemic of the disorder which becomes endemic. To\r\nterminate this condition, it is necessary to prevent the contact of\r\nman with mosquitoes and to kill these insects. Both malaria and\r\nyellow fever will doubtless be practically eradicated before long\r\nthrough the result of these scientific discoveries.\r\n\r\n=Treatment of Mosquito Bites.=--To prevent mosquitoes, fleas, lice,\r\nhorseflies, etc., from biting, it is necessary merely to dip the clean\r\nhands into a pail of water in which, while hot, one ounce of pure\r\ncarbolic acid was dissolved, and while they are thus wet rub the\r\nsolution over all the exposed skin and allow it to dry naturally. A\r\nmixture of kerosene (petroleum) and water used in the same way will\r\nalso afford protection. All poisons introduced into the body by\r\ninsects are of an acid nature, and to this quality are due the pain\r\nand irritation which it is our object to overcome. The best remedy,\r\nnaturally, is an alkali of some sort. Water of ammonia, diluted, or a\r\nstrong solution of saleratus or baking soda in water, are the two most\r\nsuccessful remedies to apply, either through bathing, or on cloths\r\nsaturated in one of the solutions. Clean clay, mixed with water to\r\nmake a mud poultice, is a useful application in emergencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n=BEE, WASP, AND HORNET STINGS.=--The pain and swelling are produced by\r\nthe poison of the insect which leaves the poison bag at the base of\r\nthe barb at the instant that the person is stung. The bee stings but\r\nonce, as the sting being barbed is broken off, and is retained in the\r\nflesh of the victim. The sting of the wasp and hornet is merely\r\npointed, and is not lost during the stinging process so that they can\r\nrepeat the act. Bee keepers, after being stung a number of times,\r\nusually become immune, i. e., they are no longer poisoned by bites of\r\nthese insects.\r\n\r\nIt is well to extract the sting of bees before all of the poison has\r\ncome away. A fine pair of forceps is useful for this purpose; or, by\r\npressing the hollow tube of a small key directly down over the\r\npuncture made by the sting, it may be squeezed out.\r\n\r\nAmmonia water, as recommended for mosquitoes, is the best remedy to\r\nrelieve the pain.\r\n\r\n\r\n=WOOD TICKS.=--Ticks inhabit the woods and bushes throughout the\r\ntemperate zone, and at certain periods during the summer season attack\r\npassing men and animals.\r\n\r\nThe common tick is nearly circular in shape, very flat, with a dark,\r\nbrown, horny body about one-sixteenth to one-eighth inch in diameter.\r\nEach of its eight legs possesses two claws, and the proboscis incloses\r\nfeelers which are similarly armed. The beetle plunges its barbed\r\nproboscis into the flesh of man or animals, and holds on very firmly\r\nwith its other members till it is gorged with blood, growing as large\r\nas a good-sized bean, when it drops off. The bite is painless, and it\r\nis not until the insect is engorged with blood that it is perceptible;\r\nif, however, attempts are made to remove the tick before it is ready\r\nto let go, the proboscis may be torn off and left in the skin, when\r\npainful local suppuration will follow.\r\n\r\n=Treatment.=--As the presence of tick is far from agreeable, the\r\ninsect may often be removed by painting it with turpentine, which\r\neither kills it or causes the claws to be relaxed; in either case the\r\ntick loosens its hold and drops to the ground. A tropical variety,\r\ncarapato, buries the whole head in the flesh of its host before it is\r\nperceived, and if turpentine does not loosen its hold, the head must\r\nbe dug out with a clean needle or knife blade.\r\n\r\n\r\n=LICE= (_Pediculi_).--Head lice are most common. They are gray with\r\nblack margins, about one-twenty-fifth to one-twelfth inch long, and\r\nwingless. The color changes with the host, as the lice are black on\r\nthe negro, and white in the case of the Eskimos. The female lays fifty\r\nto sixty eggs (\"nits\"), seen as minute, white specks glued to the side\r\nof a hair; usually not more than one or two on a single hair. The eggs\r\nhatch in six days.\r\n\r\nThe irritation produced by the presence of the parasites on the head\r\nleads to general itching, more particularly on the lower part of the\r\nback of the head. The constant scratching starts an inflammation of\r\nthe skin with the formation of pimples, weeping spots, and crusts,\r\nfrom the dried discharge, possessing a bad odor. The denuded spots\r\nbecoming infected, the neighboring glands enlarge and are felt as\r\ntender lumps beneath the skin at the back of the neck, under the jaw,\r\nor at either side of the neck. Whenever there are persistent itching\r\nand irritation of the scalp, particularly at the back of the head,\r\nlice or \"nits\" should be sought for. Sometimes it is more easy to find\r\nthem on a fine-tooth comb passed through the hair. Lice are very\r\ncommon in dirty households, and are occasionally seen on the most\r\nfastidious persons, who accidentally acquire them in public places or\r\nconveyances.\r\n\r\n=Treatment.=--The hair should be cut short when permissible. Any\r\ncrusts on the head should be softened by the application of sweet oil,\r\nand then removed by washing in soap and warm water. Petroleum or\r\nkerosene is a good remedy. It must be rubbed on the head two\r\nsuccessive nights, the head being covered by a cap, and washed off\r\neach morning with hot water and soap. The patient must be cautioned\r\nnot to approach an open flame after kerosene has been put on his head.\r\n\r\nThe eggs or \"nits\" are next to be attacked with vinegar, which is\r\nsponged on the hair and the fine-tooth comb plied daily for a week.\r\nThe remaining irritation of the scalp can be cured by washing the head\r\ndaily and applying sweet oil.\r\n\r\nA simpler plan consists of drenching hair and scalp twice with cold\r\ninfusion of (poisonous) larkspur seed, made by steeping for an hour an\r\nounce of the seed in six ounces of hot water.\r\n\r\nThis treatment will destroy both insects and eggs. After twenty-four\r\nhours the hair and scalp must be shampooed with warm water thoroughly.\r\n\r\n\r\n=CLOTHES LICE.=--These insects are a trifle larger than the head lice,\r\nbeing one-twelfth to one-eighth inch long, of a dirty, yellowish-gray\r\ncolor, and only infesting the most filthy people. The lice are\r\ngenerally only seen on the clothes, where they live, coming out on the\r\nbody only to feed. The visible signs on the body are varying degrees\r\nof irritation from redness to ulceration, due to scratching. The\r\ntreatment is simply cleanliness of the body and clothes.\r\n\r\n\r\n=CRAB LICE.=--The crab louse or \"crab\" inhabits the skin covered by\r\nhair about and above the sexual organs most frequently, and from\r\nthence spreads to the hairy region on the abdomen, chest, armpits,\r\nbeard, and eye lashes. Itching and scratching first call attention to\r\nthe presence of the parasites, which are even more troublesome than\r\nthe other species.\r\n\r\nApplication of kerosene to the part is sufficient to kill the lice,\r\nbut this treatment must be repeated several times at intervals of a\r\nweek, in order to kill the parasites subsequently hatched.\r\n\r\n\r\n=FLEA.=--Flea bites are recognized by the itching caused by the poison\r\nintroduced by the insect, and by points of dried blood surrounded for\r\na little while by a red zone. In the case of children and people with\r\ndelicate skins, red or white lumps appear resembling nettlerash.\r\nGenerally the skin is simply covered with minute, red points, perhaps\r\nraised a little by swelling above the surface, and when very numerous\r\nmay remotely resemble the rash of measles. Fleas, unlike lice, do not\r\nbreed on the body, but as soon as they are satiated leave their host.\r\nTheir eggs are laid in cracks in floors, on dirty clothes and similar\r\nspots, and it is only the mature flea which preys upon man. The human\r\nflea may infest the dog and return to man, but the dog flea is a\r\ndistinct species, and never remains permanently on the human host. For\r\nthese reasons it is not difficult to get rid of fleas after they have\r\nattacked the body, unless continually surrounded by them.\r\n\r\n\r\n=JIGGER OR SAND FLEA.=--Also called chique, chigo, and nigua. It is\r\ncommon in Cuba, Porto Rico, and Brazil. About one-half the size of the\r\nordinary flea, it is of a brownish-red color with a white spot on the\r\nback. The female lives in the sand and attacks man, on whom she lives,\r\nboring into the skin about the toe nail, usually, and laying her eggs\r\nunder the skin, which gives rise to itching at first and then violent\r\npain. The insect sucks blood and grows as it gorges itself, producing\r\na white swelling of the skin in the center of which is seen a black\r\nspot, the front part of the flea. The flea after expelling its eggs\r\ndrops off and dies. People with habitually sweaty feet are exempt from\r\nattacks of the pest.\r\n\r\nUnless the flea is unattached, one must either wait until the insect\r\ncomes away of its own free will, or remove it with a red-hot needle in\r\norder to destroy the eggs. The negroes peel the skin from the swelling\r\nwith a needle and squeeze out the eggs. Ordinarily the bites do no\r\npermanent injury, but occasionally if numerous, or if the insect is\r\npressed into the skin in the efforts to remove it, or if sores\r\nresulting from bites are neglected, then violent inflammation, great\r\npain, and even death of the part may result. Sound shoes and a night\r\nand morning inspection of the feet will protect against the inroads of\r\nthe sand fleas.\r\n\r\n\r\n=FLIES.=--The common housefly does not bite, but is constantly\r\ninimical to human health by conveying disease germs of typhoid fever,\r\ncholera, and other disorders from bowel discharges of patients\r\nsuffering from these diseases to articles of food on which the insects\r\nlight. Flies have been a fruitful source of sickness in military\r\ncamps, as evidenced in the recent Spanish-American and Anglo-African\r\ncampaigns. The bites of the sandfly, gadfly, and horsefly may be both\r\nrelieved and prevented by the same means recommended in the case of\r\nmosquitoes for these purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n=SCORPION OR CENTIPEDE STING.=\r\n\r\n_First Aid Rule.--Squeeze lemon juice on wound._\r\n\r\n\r\n=SPIDER OR TARANTULA BITE.=\r\n\r\n_First Aid Rule.--Pour water of ammonia on bite. If patient is\r\ndepressed, give strong coffee._\r\n\r\n\r\n=SCORPIONS AND CENTIPEDES.=--These both inhabit the tropics and\r\nsemitropical regions, and lurk in dark corners and out-of-the-way\r\nplaces, crawling into the boots and clothing during the night.\r\nScorpions sting with their tails, which are brought over the head and\r\nback for the purpose, while holding on to the victim with their\r\nlobsterlike claws. The poisonous centipede has a flattened\r\nbrownish-yellow body, with a single pair of short legs for each body\r\nsegment, and long, many-jointed antennae.\r\n\r\nThe wounds made by either of these pests are rarely dangerous, except\r\nin young children and those in feeble health. The stings are usually\r\nrelieved by bathing with a two per cent solution of carbolic acid,\r\nwith rum, or with lemon juice.\r\n\r\n\r\n=SPIDERS.=--Many of the tropical spiders bite the human being.\r\nTrapdoor spiders are among the commonest of these pests. Their bodies\r\ngrow to great size, two to two and a half inches long, and are covered\r\nwith hair giving them a horrid appearance. They live in holes bored in\r\nthe ground, and provided with a trapdoor contrivance which is closed\r\nwhen the insect is at home.\r\n\r\nThe trapdoor spider resembles the tarantula, by which name it is\r\nusually known in Cuba and Jamaica, but is somewhat smaller and\r\ncommoner. Neither the stings of the trapdoor spider nor true tarantula\r\nare usually dangerous although the wounds caused by the bites may heal\r\nslowly.\r\n\r\nApplication of water of ammonia and of the other remedies recommended\r\nfor mosquito bites (p. 158) are indicated here, and if the patient is\r\ngenerally depressed by the poison, strong coffee forms a good\r\nantidote.\r\n\r\n\r\n=SNAKE BITE.=\r\n\r\n_First Aid Rule 1.--Make the wound bleed. Cut slit through the wound,\r\nlengthwise of limb, two inches long and half an inch deep. Squeeze\r\ntissues._ DO NOT SUCK THE WOUND.\r\n\r\n_Rule 2.--Keep poison out of general circulation. Tie large cord or\r\nbandage tightly about part between wound and heart. Loosen in fifteen\r\nminutes._\r\n\r\n_Rule 3.--Use antidote. Wash wound and cut with fresh solution of\r\nchloride of lime (one part to sixty parts of water). Inject\r\nanti-venene with hypodermic syringe, ten cubic centimeters, as on\r\nlabel. Or, inject with hypodermic syringe thirty minims of solution of\r\npermanganate of potash (five grains to two ounces of water), three\r\ntimes in different places. If no syringe at hand, pour permanganate\r\nsolution into wound._\r\n\r\n_Rule 4.--Support heart if weak. Inject with hypodermic syringe\r\none-thirtieth grain of sulphate of strychnine into leg. Repeat as\r\nneeded every thirty minutes with caution._\r\n\r\n_Rule 5.--Give no whisky or other liquor. Do not burn the wound._\r\n\r\n\r\n=SNAKE BITE.=--There are many different species of poisonous snakes in\r\nthe United States. The more common are the rattlesnake, the moccasin,\r\nthe copperhead, and the common viper.\r\n\r\nAll the venomous snakes have certain characteristics by which they may\r\nbe distinguished from their harmless brethren. The head is generally\r\nbroad and flat and of a triangular shape, the wide, heavy jaws\r\ntapering to a point at the lips. There is a depression or pit between\r\nthe nostril and eye on the upper lip, hence the name \"pit vipers\"\r\ngiven to poisonous snakes. The pupil of the eye is long and vertical,\r\nof an oval or elliptical shape.\r\n\r\nVenomous snakes are thicker in proportion to their length than\r\nharmless snakes, the surface of their bodies is rougher, and their\r\ntails are blunt or club-shaped. Conversely, harmless snakes possess\r\nlong narrow heads, the pupils of their eyes are round, not vertical\r\nslits, and their bodies are not thick for their length, but long and\r\nslim with pointed tails. The bite of vipers of all kinds is much more\r\npoisonous in tropical regions, and in the North fatal snake bite is a\r\nrare occurrence.\r\n\r\nIf there is a doubt whether a snake is poisonous, the neck may be\r\npressed down against the ground between the jaws of a forked stick,\r\nand the poison fangs looked for without danger. These hang directly\r\ndown from the front part of the upper jaw, or are thrust horizontally\r\nforward just in front of the upper lip, and may drip saliva and venom.\r\n\r\nIn Cuba and Porto Rico there is a viper called Juba, or Boaquira,\r\nwhich is a counterpart of the Northern rattlesnake, and the most\r\npoisonous of the many species in that region. Among venomous species\r\nof the Philippines are two boas and also a viper from nine to ten feet\r\nlong, which exceptionally pursues and attacks man. This snake is\r\neasily killed by a blow on the neck. Another small viper with a\r\nclub-shaped tail, inhabiting these islands, is nocturnal in its\r\nhabits, and may get into boots at night. Boots, therefore, should\r\nalways be inspected before one puts them on in the morning.\r\n\r\nUsually it is only the young, old, and weak who succumb to snake bite.\r\n\r\n=Symptoms.=--The symptoms of snake bite of all poisonous species are\r\nsimilar. At first there is some pain in the wound, which rapidly\r\nincreases together with swelling and discoloration until death of the\r\npart may ensue. The vital centers in the brain controlling the heart\r\nand breathing apparatus, are paralyzed by the poison. There is often\r\ndrowsiness and stupor, and the breathing is labored and the pulse weak\r\nand irregular, with faintness and cold sweats.\r\n\r\n=Treatment.=--The treatment consists first in keeping the poison out\r\nof the general blood stream. With this purpose in view a handkerchief,\r\npiece of cotton clothing, string, or strap should be immediately wound\r\nabout the bitten limb above the wound, between it and the heart. This\r\nwill retard absorption of the poison only for a time; it is said\r\ntwenty-five minutes. The knife is the most effective means of removing\r\nthe poison by making an oval cut on each side of the wound so that the\r\ntwo incisions meet and remove all the flesh below and around the\r\nwound. Bleeding should be encouraged to drain out the poison. The skin\r\ncontaining the wound may be lifted up, and the whole wound cut out by\r\none snip of the scissors where this is practicable.\r\n\r\nSome advocate burning out the wound with a red-hot wire, or darning\r\nneedle, instead of cutting, but the treatment is less effective and\r\nmore painful. Rambaud forbids burning. As to the general condition: if\r\nstupor is a prominent symptom the patient must be made to move about\r\nand exercise to keep alive his nerve centers. Otherwise one\r\ntablespoonful of whisky may be given in half a cup of hot water\r\nhourly, to sustain the weakened heart and respiration until recovery\r\nensues.\r\n\r\nThe most effective treatment, according to Dr. George Rambaud,\r\nDirector of the Pasteur Institute of New York City, is thorough\r\nwashing of the wound (after it has been opened with the knife) with\r\nfreshly prepared solution of chloride of lime, in the proportion of\r\none part of lime to sixty of water. The burning of a wound is bad\r\npractice. If necessary, chloride-of-lime solution should be injected\r\ninto the tissues around the wound. One about to go into a place where\r\nthe most venomous snakes are found should inject into himself a dose\r\nof Calmette's antivenomous serum every two or three weeks as a means\r\nof prevention. If the serum is used, whisky should not be given in the\r\ntreatment of one who has been bitten, for the anti-venene is a\r\npowerful cell stimulator.\r\n\r\nCalmette, the Director of the Pasteur Institute in Lille, France,\r\nseveral years ago discovered antivenomous serum. That serum is\r\nefficient for the bites of most of the venomous snakes of different\r\ncountries, including the rattlesnake, cobra, python, etc.\r\n\r\nIt is prepared in the dry form so that it can be carried easily, and\r\nwill keep almost indefinitely. The proper course to be followed by\r\npersons going into countries infested by venomous snakes is always to\r\nhave on hand a few doses of it. Its value has been positively\r\ndemonstrated within the last few years in India, where it is used in\r\nthe British Army, as well as in other countries.\r\n\r\nIn the fluid form it should be used hypodermically, a dose of ten\r\ncubic centimeters being injected within eighty or ninety minutes of\r\nthe reception of the poison.\r\n\r\n\r\n=DOG BITE OR CAT BITE.= (See Hydrophobia, Vol. V, p. 264.)\r\n\r\n_First Aid Rule 1.--Make sure animal is mad. Send patient to Pasteur\r\ninstitute if one is within reach._\r\n\r\n_Rule 2.--Remove poison from wound. Encourage bleeding by squeezing\r\ntissue about wound. Suck wound, if you have no cracks in lips, and\r\nspit out fluid. Pour hot carbolic solution into wound (a third of a\r\nteaspoonful of carbolic acid to a pint of hot water)._\r\n\r\n_Rule 3.--Cauterize. Dip wooden meat skewer, or lead pencil, into pure\r\nnitric acid, and rub into wound. Or, use red-hot poker, or red-hot\r\nnail grasped by tongs or pincers, or red coal from fire._\r\n\r\n_Rule 4.--Do not kill the animal. If he is alive and well at the end\r\nof a week, he was not mad._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n=Burns, Scalds, Frostbites, Etc.=\r\n\r\n_Classes of Burns--Treatment--Burns Caused by Acids and\r\nAlkalies--First Aid Rules for Frostbites--Real Freezing--Ingrowing Toe\r\nNail--Fainting--Suffocation--Fits._\r\n\r\n\r\n=BURNS AND SCALDS.=--If slight, skin very red, unbroken.\r\n\r\n_First Aid Rule.--Cover with cloths wet in strong solution of baking\r\nsoda in cold water. Dry gently, and spread with white of egg, thick._\r\n\r\nIf deeper, blisters, skin broken, thick swelling; there may be some\r\nbleeding.\r\n\r\n_First Aid Rule 1.--Stop pain quickly. Cut away clothing very gently.\r\nBreak no blisters. Cover with Carron oil (equal parts of limewater and\r\nlinseed or olive oil) and light bandage. Give fifteen drops of\r\nlaudanum[9] every half hour in tablespoonful of water, till relieved\r\nin part or three doses are taken._\r\n\r\n_Rule 2.--Combat shock. If patient is cold, pulse weak, head confused,\r\ngive tablespoonful of whisky in a quarter of a glass of hot water. Put\r\nhot-water bottles at feet._\r\n\r\n_Rule 3.--Quench thirst with pieces of ice held in mouth or a swallow\r\nof cold milk._\r\n\r\nSee page 174 for subsequent treatment.\r\n\r\nA burn is produced by dry heat, a scald by moist heat; the effect and\r\ntreatment of both are practically identical. Burns are commonly\r\ndivided into three classes, according to the amount of damage\r\ninflicted upon the body.\r\n\r\n_First Class._--There is redness, pain, and some swelling of the skin,\r\nfollowed, in a few days, by peeling of the surface layer (epidermis)\r\nand recovery. Sunburn and burns caused by slight exposures to gases\r\nand vapors fall into this category.\r\n\r\n=Treatment.=--The immediate immersion of the part in cold water is\r\nfollowed by relief, or the application of cloths wet with a saturated\r\nsolution of saleratus or baking powder is useful. Anything which\r\nprotects the burned skin from the irritating effect of the air is\r\nefficacious, and in emergencies any one of the following may be\r\napplied: starch, flour, molasses, white paint, or a mixture of white\r\nof egg and sweet oil, equal parts. Usually after the first pain has\r\nbeen relieved by bathing with soda and water, or its application on\r\ncloths, the employment of a simple ointment suffices, as cold cream or\r\nvaseline.\r\n\r\n_Second Class._--In this class of cases the inflammation is more\r\nsevere and the deeper layers of the skin are involved. In addition to\r\nthe redness and swelling of the skin there are present blisters which\r\nappear at once or within a few hours. The general condition is\r\naffected according to the size of the burn. If half of the body is\r\nonly reddened, death usually results, and a burn of a third of the\r\nbody is often fatal. The shock is so great at times that pain may not\r\nbe at once intense. Shock is evidenced by general depression, with\r\nweakness, apathy, cold feet and hands, and failure of the pulse. If\r\nthe patient rallies from this condition, then fever and pain become\r\nprominent. If steam has been inhaled, there may be sudden death from\r\nswelling of the interior of the throat, or inflammation of the lungs\r\nmay follow inhalation of smoke and hot air.\r\n\r\n_Third Class._--In this class are included burns of so severe a nature\r\nthat destruction and death of the tissues follows; not only of the\r\nskin but of the flesh and bones in the worst cases. It is impossible\r\nto tell by the appearance of the skin what the extent of the\r\ndestruction may be until the dead parts slough away after a week or\r\nten days. The skin is of a uniform white color in some cases, or may\r\nbe of a yellow, brown, gray, or black hue, and is comparatively\r\ninsensitive at first. Pus (\"matter\") begins to form around the dead\r\npart in a few days, and the dead tissue comes away later, to be\r\nfollowed by a long course of suppuration, pain, excessive granulations\r\n(\"proud flesh\"), and, unless skillfully treated, by contraction of the\r\nsurrounding area, leaving ugly scars and interfering with the\r\nappearance and usefulness of the parts. The treatment of such cases\r\nafter the first care becomes that to be pursued in wounds generally\r\n(p. 50), and belongs within the domain of the surgeon.\r\n\r\n=Treatment of the More Severe Burns.=--If the patient is suffering\r\nfrom shock he should receive some hot alcoholic drink, as hot water\r\nand whisky, and be put to bed under warm coverings with hot-water bags\r\nor bottles at his feet.\r\n\r\nThe clothing must be cut away from the burned parts with the greatest\r\ncare, and only a portion of the body should be uncovered at a time and\r\nin a warm room. Pain may be subdued by laudanum[10]; fifteen drops may\r\nbe given to an adult, and the drug may be repeated at hour intervals\r\nin doses of ten drops until the suffering has been allayed. Lumps of\r\nice held in the mouth will quench thirst, and the diet should be\r\nliquid, as milk, soups, gruels, white of egg, and water. The bowels\r\nshould be moved daily by rectal injections of soap and warm water. As\r\na matter of local treatment, the surface layer of the skin should be\r\nkept intact if possible. Blisters are not to be disturbed unless they\r\nare large and tense; if so, their bases may be pricked with a needle\r\nsufficiently to let out the fluid contents.\r\n\r\nCarron oil (equal parts of olive oil and limewater) has been the\r\ncommon remedy for burns, and it is an efficient, though very dirty,\r\ndressing, useful if the skin is generally unbroken. It should be\r\napplied on clean, soft linen or cotton cloth, which is soaked in the\r\noil, laid over the burned area, and covered with a thick layer of\r\ncotton batting and a bandage. When the skin is denuded, leaving a raw\r\nsurface exposed, the burn must be treated on the same plan as wounds,\r\nand should be kept as clean and free from germs as possible. An\r\nointment made of equal parts of boric acid and vaseline, spread\r\nthickly on clean cloth, is a good antiseptic preparation in cases\r\nwhere the skin is broken. It is best not to change the dressing\r\noftener than once in two or three days, unless the discharge or odor\r\nare considerable. Fresh dressing is very painful and often harmful.\r\n\r\nWhen the dressing is removed, warm saline solution (one teaspoonful of\r\ncommon salt in a quart of water) is allowed to flow over the burn\r\nuntil all discharge is washed off. Then the raw surface is dusted over\r\nwith pure boric acid or aristol, and the boric-acid ointment applied\r\nas before. The cloth upon which the ointment is spread should be made\r\nfree from germs by boiling in water, and then drying it in an oven and\r\nkeeping it well wrapped in a clean towel except when wanted.\r\n\r\nThe same care is requisite as that described under wounds (p. 50) in\r\nregard to cleanliness.\r\n\r\nVery extensive burns are most satisfactorily treated by complete\r\nimmersion of the burned limbs or entire body in salt solution (same\r\nstrength as above), which is kept at a temperature of from 94 deg. to\r\n104 deg. F., according to the feelings of the patient. The patient lies in\r\na bath tub on horsehair, or better, rubber mattress and rubber\r\npillows; completely covered with water except the head. The urine and\r\nbowel discharges must be passed in the water, which is then changed,\r\nand the temperature is kept at an even mark by allowing warm water to\r\ncontinually run into the tub to displace that which runs out. The\r\nlatter can be arranged by siphonage with a rubber tube. While this\r\nmethod requires more care, and running hot and cold water, it is the\r\nmost comfortable treatment for these cases, usually attended by awful\r\nsuffering, and at the same time it is most favorable to healing.\r\n\r\nIt is beyond the scope of this work to describe the various\r\ncomplications and the details of the after treatment in severe burns,\r\nincluding skin grafting, which may tax all the ingenuity of the\r\nskilled surgeon. It is hoped that the foregoing may give a clear idea\r\nof the treatment to be pursued in emergencies and may prove of some\r\nuse to those who may unfortunately be compelled to care for burns\r\nduring a considerable time without the aid of a physician.\r\n\r\n\r\n=BURN BY STRONG ACID.=\r\n\r\n_First Aid Rule 1.--Neutralize the acid. Scatter baking soda thickly\r\nover burn, or pour limewater over it._\r\n\r\n_Rule 2.--Control pain. Wash off soda with stream of water. Apply\r\nCarron oil (equal parts of limewater and linseed oil or olive oil).\r\nBandage lightly._\r\n\r\n\r\n=BURN BY STRONG ALKALI.=--As ammonia, quicklime, lye.\r\n\r\n_First Aid Rule 1.--Neutralize the alkali. Pour vinegar over the\r\nburn._\r\n\r\n_Rule 2.--Control pain. Wash off vinegar with stream of water. Dry\r\ngently. Apply vaseline or cold cream._\r\n\r\n\r\n=BURNS CAUSED BY STRONG MINERAL ACIDS OR BY ALKALIES.=--If acids are\r\nthe cause, the skin should not be washed at first, but either chalk,\r\nwhiting, or some mild alkali, as baking soda, should be strewn over\r\nthe burn, and then after the effect of the acid is neutralized, wash\r\noff the soda with stream of warm water. Dry gently with gauze. Apply\r\nCarron oil or paste of boric acid and vaseline, equal parts. If strong\r\nalkalies have been spilled on the skin, as ammonia, potash, or\r\nquicklime, then vinegar is the proper substance to employ, followed by\r\nwashing. Then dry gently. Vaseline or cold cream is usually sufficient\r\nas after treatment. Limewater is useful in counteracting the effect of\r\nacids spattered in the eye. In the case of alkalies in the eye, the\r\nvinegar used should be diluted with three parts of water. Albolene or\r\nliquid vaseline is the best agent to drop in the eye after either\r\naccident, in order to relieve the irritation and pain, and the\r\npatient should stay in a dark room.\r\n\r\n\r\n=FROSTBITE, REAL FREEZING.=--Nose, ears, fingers, toes; insensible to\r\ntouch, stiff, pale or blue. Person may be unconscious.\r\n\r\n_First Aid Rule 1.--Restore circulation. Rub gently, then vigorously,\r\nwith snow._\r\n\r\n_Rule 2.--Restore heat very gradually. Sudden heat is fatal. Keep in\r\ncold room, and rub with cloth wet with very cold water till\r\ncirculation is established. Then rub with equal parts of alcohol and\r\nwater and expose gradually to heat of living room._\r\n\r\n_Rule 3.--If person ceases to breathe, resuscitate as if drowned. Open\r\nhis mouth, grasp his tongue, and pull it forward and keep it there.\r\nLet another assistant grasp the arms just below the elbows and draw\r\nthem steadily upward by the sides of the patient's head to the ground,\r\nthe hands nearly meeting (which enlarges the capacity of the chest and\r\ninduces inspiration.) (See pp. 30 and 31.) While this is being done,\r\nlet a third assistant take position astride the patient's hips with\r\nhis elbows resting on his own knees, his hands extended ready for\r\naction. Next, let the assistant standing at the head turn down the\r\npatient's arms to the sides of the body, the assistant holding the\r\ntongue changing hands if necessary to let the arms pass. Just before\r\nthe patient's hands reach the ground the man astride the body will\r\ngrasp the body with his hands, the ball of the thumb resting on\r\neither side of the pit of the stomach, the fingers falling into the\r\ngrooves between the short ribs. Now, using his knees as a pivot, he\r\nwill at the moment the patient's hands touch the ground throw (not too\r\nsuddenly) his whole weight forward on his hands, and at the same time\r\nsqueeze the waist between them, as if he wished to force something in\r\nthe chest upward out of the mouth; he will deepen the pressure while\r\nhe slowly counts one, two, three, four (about five seconds), then\r\nsuddenly lets go with a final push, which will send him back to his\r\nfirst position. This completes expiration. (A child or a delicate\r\nperson must be more gently handled.)_\r\n\r\n_At the instant of letting go, the man at the head of the patient will\r\nagain draw the arms steadily upward to the sides of the patient's head\r\nas before (the assistant holding the tongue again changing hands to\r\nlet the arms pass, if necessary), holding them there while he slowly\r\ncounts one, two, three, four (about five seconds)._\r\n\r\n_Repeat these movements deliberately and perseveringly twelve or\r\nfifteen times in every minute--thus imitating the natural motions of\r\nbreathing. Continue the artificial respiration from one to four hours,\r\nor until the patient breathes; and for a while after the appearance of\r\nreturning life carefully aid the first short gasps until deepened into\r\nfull breaths._\r\n\r\n_Keep body warm after this with warm-water bottles._\r\n\r\n\r\n=FROSTBITE.=--The nose, chin, ears, fingers, and toes are the parts\r\nusually frozen, although severe results ending in death of the frozen\r\npart occur more often owing to low vitality of the patient than to the\r\ncold itself. In the milder degree of frostbite there is stiffness,\r\nnumbness, and tingling of the frozen member; the skin is of a pale,\r\nbluish hue and somewhat shrunken. Recovery ensues with burning pain,\r\ntingling, redness, swelling and peeling of the epidermis, as after\r\nslight burns. The skin is icy cold, white, and insensitive in severe\r\nforms of frostbite, and, if not skillfully treated, becomes, later,\r\neither swollen and discolored, or shriveled, dry, and black. In either\r\ncase the frozen part dies and is separated from the living tissue\r\nafter the establishment of a sharp line of inflammation which results\r\nin ulceration and formation of pus, and thus the dead part sloughs\r\noff. It is, however, possible for a part thoroughly frozen to regain\r\nits vitality.\r\n\r\n=Treatment.=--The essential element in the treatment is to secure a\r\nvery gradual return of blood to the frozen tissues, and so avoid\r\nviolent inflammation. To obtain this result the patient should be\r\ncared for in a cold room, the frozen parts are rubbed gently with\r\nsnow, or cloth wet with ice water, until they resume their usual\r\nwarmth. Then it is well to rub them with a mixture of alcohol and\r\nwater, equal parts, for a time and expose them to the usual\r\ntemperature of a dwelling room. Warm drinks are now administered to\r\nthe patient. The frozen member, if hand or foot, is raised high in\r\nthe air on pillows and covered well with absorbent cotton and bandage.\r\nIf much redness, swelling, and pain result this dressing is removed\r\nand the part is wrapped in a single thickness of cotton cloth kept\r\ncontinually wet with alcohol and water.\r\n\r\nSubsequent treatment consists in keeping the damaged parts covered\r\nwith vaseline or cold cream, absorbent cotton, and bandage. If\r\nblisters and sores result, the care is similar to that described for\r\nlike conditions under burns. If death of the frozen part becomes\r\ninevitable, the hand or foot should be suspended in a nearly vertical\r\nposition to keep the blood out, and the part bathed twice daily with a\r\nsolution of corrosive sublimate (one 7.7 gr. tablet to pint of water),\r\ndusted well with aristol, and dressed with absorbent cotton and\r\nbandage until the dead tissue separates and comes away. If the frozen\r\npart is large it may be necessary to remove it with a knife, but this\r\nis not essential when the tips of the fingers or toes are frozen.\r\n\r\n=General Effect of Cold.=--Sudden exposure to severe cold causes\r\nsleep, stupor, and death. Persons found apparently frozen to death\r\nshould be brought into a cold room, which should be gradually heated,\r\nand the body rubbed with snow or ice water, and artificial respiration\r\nemployed, as just directed. Attempts at resuscitation ought to be\r\npersistent, as recoveries have been reported after several hours of\r\nunconsciousness and apparent death from freezing.\r\n\r\n\r\n=CHILBLAINS AND MILD FROSTBITES.=--The effects of severe cold on the\r\nbody are very similar to those of intense heat, though they are very\r\nmuch slower in making their appearance. After a person has frozen a\r\nfinger or toe he may not notice much inconvenience for days, when\r\nsuddenly violent inflammation may set in. The fingers, ears, nose, and\r\ntoes are the members which suffer most frequently from the effects of\r\ncold. Similar symptoms of inflammation, described under burns, also\r\nresult from cold, that is, redness and swelling of the skin, blisters\r\nwith more severe and deeper inflammatory involvement, or, in case the\r\nparts are thoroughly frozen, local death and destruction of the\r\ntissues. But it is not essential that the body be exposed to the\r\nfreezing temperature or be frozen at all, in order that some harm may\r\nresult, for chilblains often follow when the temperature has not been\r\nlower than 40 deg. F., or thereabouts.\r\n\r\nThe effect of cold is to contract the blood vessels, with the\r\nproduction of numbness, pallor, and tingling of the skin. When the\r\ncold no longer acts then the blood vessels dilate to more than their\r\nusual and normal state, and more or less inflammation results. The\r\nmore sudden the return to warmth the greater the inflammatory sequel.\r\n\r\nChilblains represent the mildest morbid effect of cold on the body.\r\nThey exist as bluish-red swellings of the skin, usually on the feet or\r\nhands, but may attack the nose or ears, and are attended by burning,\r\nitching, and smarting. This condition is caused by dilatation of the\r\nvessels following exposure to cold. It is more apt to happen in young,\r\nanaemic women. Chilblains usually disappear during warm weather.\r\nScratching, friction, or the severity of the attack may lead to the\r\nappearance of blisters and sores. In severe cases the fingers and toes\r\npresent a sausage-like appearance, owing to swelling.\r\n\r\n=Treatment.=--Susceptible persons should wear thick, warm (not rough)\r\nstockings and warm gloves. The chilled members must never be suddenly\r\nwarmed. Regular exercise and cold shower baths are good to strengthen\r\nthe circulation, but the feet and hands must be washed in warm water\r\nonly, and thoroughly dried. If sweating of these parts is a common\r\noccurrence, starch or zinc oxide should be dusted on freely night and\r\nmorning. Cod-liver oil is an efficacious remedy in these cases; one\r\nteaspoonful of Peter Moeller's pure oil three times daily after meals.\r\nThe affected parts are bathed twice daily in a solution of zinc\r\nacetate (one dram to one pint of water), and followed by the\r\napplication, on soft linen or cotton, of zinc-oxide ointment\r\ncontaining two per cent of carbolic acid. If this is not curative,\r\niodine ointment mixed with an equal quantity of lard may be tried.\r\nExposure to cold will immediately bring on a recurrence of the\r\ntrouble. If the affection of the feet is severe the patient must rest\r\nin bed. If the parts become blistered and open sores appear, then the\r\nsame treatment as for burns is indicated. Wash with a weak solution\r\nof corrosive sublimate (one tablet for surgical purposes in two quarts\r\nof warm water) and apply an ointment of boric acid and vaseline, equal\r\nparts, spread on soft, clean cotton or linen. Rest of the part and\r\nexistence in a warm atmosphere will complete the cure.\r\n\r\n\r\n=INGROWING TOE NAIL.=--This is a condition in which the flesh along\r\nthe edges of the great toe nail becomes inflamed, owing either to\r\novergrowth of the nail or to pressure of the soft parts against it.\r\nImproper footgear is the most common cause, as shoes which are too\r\nnarrow across the toes, or not long enough, or those with high heels\r\nwhich throw the toes forward so that they are compressed by the toe of\r\nthe boot, especially in walking downhill.\r\n\r\nA faulty mode of cutting the toe nails in a healthy foot may favor\r\ningrowing toe nails. Toe nails should be cut straight across, and not\r\ntrimmed away at the corners to follow the outline of the toes--as then\r\nthe flesh crowds in at the corners of the nails, and when the nail\r\npushes forward in its growth it presses into the flesh. Nails which\r\nhave a very rounded surface are more apt to produce trouble, because\r\nthen the edges are likely to grow down into the flesh. Inflammation in\r\ningrowing toe nail usually arises along the outer edge of the nail.\r\nThe flesh here becomes red, tender, painful, and swollen so that it\r\noverlaps the nail. After a time \"matter\" or pus forms and finds its\r\nway under the nail, and the parts about it ulcerate, and \"proud\r\nflesh\" or excessive granulation tissue springs up and imbeds the edge\r\nof the nail. Wearing a shoe, or walking, becomes impossible. The\r\ncondition may last for months, or even years, if not rightly treated.\r\n\r\n=Treatment.=--Properly fitting footgear must be worn--broad at the\r\ntoes with low heels and of sufficient length. If pus (\"matter\") forms,\r\nthe cut edge should be raised up by pushing in a little absorbent\r\ncotton under the nail every day. Hot poultices of flaxseed meal, or\r\nother material will relieve any special pain and inflammation. Soaking\r\nthe foot frequently in hot water, and observing especial cleanliness,\r\nwill aid recovery. Tannic acid, or some antiseptic powder like\r\nnosophen, should be dusted along the edge of the nail, and the flesh\r\ncrowded away from the nail by pushing in a little cotton with some\r\ntannic acid upon it.\r\n\r\nIf there is a raw surface about the border of the nail, powdered lead\r\nnitrate may be dusted upon it each morning for four or five days, till\r\nthe ulcerated tissue shrinks away and the edge of the nail becomes\r\nvisible. The toe should be covered with absorbent cotton and a\r\nbandage. As soon as the toe is really inflamed the case becomes\r\nsurgical, and as such demands the care of a surgeon when one can be\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\n\r\n=FAINTING.=\r\n\r\n_First Aid Rule 1.--Remove impediments to respiration. Remove collar,\r\nloosen all waist bands and cords, unhook corset or cut the laces at\r\nperson's back._\r\n\r\n_Rule 2.--Assist heart and brain with blood pressure. Put cushion\r\nunder buttocks, wind skirt close about legs, and raise feet in air.\r\nWait ten seconds._\r\n\r\n_Rule 3.--Aid respiration. Put mild smelling salts under nose. Spatter\r\ncold water in face._\r\n\r\n\r\n=SUFFOCATION FROM GAS IN WELLS, CISTERNS, OR MINES, OR FROM\r\nILLUMINATING GAS.=\r\n\r\n_First Aid Rule 1.--Remove quickly into pure air._\r\n\r\n_Rule 2.--Resuscitate as if drowned. Open his mouth, grasp his tongue,\r\npull it forward and keep it there. Let another assistant grasp the\r\narms just below the elbows, and draw them steadily upward by the sides\r\nof the patient's head to the ground, the hands nearly meeting, which\r\nenlarges the capacity of the chest and induces inspiration. (See pp.\r\n30 and 31.) While this is being done, let a third assistant take\r\nposition astride the patient's hips with his elbows resting on his own\r\nknees, his hands extended ready for action. Next, let the assistant\r\nstanding at the head turn down the patient's arms to the sides of his\r\nbody, the assistant holding the tongue, changing hands if necessary to\r\nlet the arms pass._\r\n\r\n_Just before the patient's hands reach the ground, the man astride the\r\nbody will grasp the body with his hands, the ball of the thumb resting\r\non either side of the pit of the stomach, the fingers falling into\r\nthe grooves between the short ribs. Now, using his knees as a pivot,\r\nhe will, at the moment the patient's hands touch the ground, throw\r\n(not too suddenly) his whole weight forward on his hands, and at the\r\nsame time squeeze the waist between them, as if he wished to force\r\nsomething in the chest upward out of the mouth; he will deepen the\r\npressure while he slowly counts one, two, three, four (about five\r\nseconds), then suddenly lets go with a final push, which will send him\r\nback to his first position. This completes expiration. A child or a\r\ndelicate person must be more gently handled._\r\n\r\n_At the instant of letting go, the man at the head of the patient will\r\nagain draw the arms steadily upward, to the sides of the patient's\r\nhead, as before (the assistant holding the tongue again, changing\r\nhands if necessary to let the arms pass, holding them there while he\r\nslowly counts one, two, three, four (about five seconds))._\r\n\r\n_Repeat these movements deliberately and perseveringly twelve or\r\nfifteen times in every minute, thus imitating the natural motions of\r\nbreathing. Continue the artificial respiration from one to four hours,\r\nor until the patient breathes; and for a while after the appearance of\r\nreturning life, carefully aid the first short gasps until deepened\r\ninto full breaths._\r\n\r\n_Keep the body warm with hot-water bottles and blanket._\r\n\r\n_Rule 3.--Give oxygen to breathe from a cylinder, for two days, at\r\nshort intervals, in the case of illuminating gas._\r\n\r\n\r\n=FIT; CONVULSION.=\r\n\r\n_First Aid Rule 1.--Aid breathing. Loosen collar, waist bands, and\r\nunhook corset, or cut the laces behind._\r\n\r\n_Rule 2.--Protect from injury. Gently restrain from falling or rolling\r\nagainst furniture; lay flat on bed._\r\n\r\n_Rule 3.--Protect tongue from being bitten. Open jaws and put between\r\nteeth rubber eraser tied to stout string, or rubber stopper tied to\r\nstout string._\r\n\r\n_Rule 4.--Crush pearl of amyl nitrite in handkerchief, and hold close\r\nto patient's nose and mouth, till face is red and patient relaxes._\r\n\r\n_Rule 5.--Let patient sleep after fit without rousing._\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[9] Caution.

As they all\r\nbegin with fever, and the characteristic rash does not appear for from\r\none to four days after the beginning of the sickness, the diagnosis of\r\nthese diseases must always be at the onset a matter of doubt. For this\r\nreason it is wise to keep any child with a fever isolated, even if the\r\ntrouble seems to be due to \"a cold\" or to digestive disturbance, to\r\navoid possible communication of the disorder to other children. While\r\ncolds and indigestion are among the most frequent ailments of\r\nchildren, they must not be neglected, for measles begins as a bad\r\ncold, smallpox like the _grippe_, and scarlet fever with a sore throat\r\nor tonsilitis, and vomiting.\r\n\r\nBy isolation is meant that the sick child should stay in a room by\r\nhimself, and the doors should be kept closed and no children should\r\nenter, nor should any objects in the room be removed to other parts of\r\nthe house after the beginning of its occupation by the patient.\r\n\r\nThe services of a physician are particularly desirable in all these\r\ndiseases, in order that an early diagnosis be made and measures be\r\ntaken to protect the family, neighbors, and community from contagion.\r\nThe failure of parents or guardians to secure medical aid for children\r\nis regarded by the law as criminal neglect, and is subject to\r\npunishment. Boards of health require the reporting of all contagious\r\ndiseases as soon as their presence is known, and failure to comply\r\nwith their rules also renders the offender liable to fine or\r\nimprisonment in most places.\r\n\r\n\r\n=SCARLET FEVER= (_Scarlatina_).--There is no difference between\r\nscarlet fever and scarlatina. It is a popular mistake that the latter\r\nis a mild type of scarlet fever. Fever, sore throat, and a bright-red\r\nrash are the characteristics of this disease. It occurs most\r\nfrequently in children between the ages of two and six years. It is\r\npractically unknown under one year of age. Prof. H. M. Biggs, of the\r\nNew York Department of Health, has seen but two undoubted cases in\r\ninfants under twelve months. It is rare in adults, and one attack\r\nusually protects the patient from another. Second attacks have\r\noccurred, but many such are more apparent than real, since an error in\r\ndiagnosis is not uncommon. The disease is communicated chiefly by\r\nmeans of the scales of skin which escape during the peeling process,\r\nbut may also be acquired at any time from the onset of the attack from\r\nthe breath, urine, and discharges from the body; or from substances\r\nwhich have come in contact with these emanations. Scarlet fever is\r\nprobably a germ disease, and the germs may live for weeks in toys,\r\nbooks, letters, clothing, wall paper, etc. Close contact with the\r\npatient, or with objects which have come in close touch with the\r\npatient, is apparently necessary for contagion.\r\n\r\n=Period of Development.=--After exposure to the germs of scarlet\r\nfever, usually from two to five days elapse before the disease shows\r\nitself. Occasionally the outbreak of the disease occurs within\r\ntwenty-four hours of exposure, and rarely is delayed for a week or ten\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n=Symptoms.=--The onset is usually sudden. It begins with vomiting (in\r\nvery young children sometimes convulsions), sore throat, fever,\r\nchilliness, and headache. The tongue is furred. The patient is often\r\nstupid; or may be restless and delirious. Within twenty-four hours or\r\nso the rash appears--first on the neck, chest, or lower part of\r\nback--and rapidly spreads over the trunk, and by the end of\r\nforty-eight hours covers the legs and entire body excepting the face,\r\nwhich may be simply flushed. The rash appears as fine, scarlet pin\r\npoints scattered over a background of flushed skin. At its fullest\r\ndevelopment, at the end of the second or third day, the whole body may\r\npresent the color of a boiled lobster. After this time the rash\r\ngenerally fades away and disappears within five to seven days. It is\r\nlikely to vary much in intensity while it lasts. As the rash fades,\r\nscaling of the skin begins in large flakes and continues from ten days\r\nto as many weeks, usually terminating by the end of the sixth to\r\neighth week. One of the notable features is the appearance of the\r\ntongue, at first showing red points through a white coating, and after\r\nthis has cleared away, in presenting a raspberry-like aspect. The\r\nthroat is generally deep red, and the tonsils may be dotted over with\r\nwhite spots (see Tonsilitis) or covered with a whitish or gray\r\nmembrane suggesting diphtheria, which occasionally complicates scarlet\r\nfever. The fever usually is high (103 deg. to 107 deg. F), and the pulse\r\nranges from 120 to 150; both declining after the rash is fully\r\ndeveloped, generally by the fourth day. The urine is scanty and dark.\r\nThere is, however, great variation in the symptoms as to their\r\npresence or absence, intensity, and time of occurrence and\r\ndisappearance.\r\n\r\n=Complications and Sequels.=--These are frequent and make scarlet\r\nfever the most dreaded of the eruptive diseases, except smallpox.\r\nEnlarged glands under the jaw and at the sides of the neck are common,\r\nand appear as lumps in these sites. Usually not serious, they may\r\nenlarge and threaten life. Pain and swelling in the joints, especially\r\nof the elbows and knees, are not rare, and may be the precursors of\r\nserious inflammation of these parts. One of the most frequent and\r\nserious complications of scarlet fever is inflammation of the kidneys,\r\noccurring more often toward the end of the second week of the disease.\r\nExamination of the urine by the attending physician at frequent\r\nintervals throughout the course of the disorder is essential, although\r\npuffiness of the eyelids and face, and of the feet, ankles, and hands,\r\ntogether with lessened secretion of urine--which often becomes of a\r\ndark and smoky hue--may denote the onset of this complication. The\r\ndisease of the kidneys usually results in recovery, but occasionally\r\nin death or in chronic Bright's disease of these organs. Inflammation\r\nof the middle ear with abscess, discharge of matter from the ear\r\nexternally, and--as the final outcome--deafness, is not uncommon. This\r\ncomplication may be prevented to a considerable extent by spraying the\r\nnose and throat frequently and by the patient's use of a nightcap with\r\nearlaps, if the room is not sufficiently warm. Inflammation of the\r\neyelids is an occasional complication. The heart is sometimes attacked\r\nby the toxins of the disease, and permanent damage to the organ, in\r\nthe form of valvular trouble, may result. Blindness and nervous\r\ndisorders are among the rarer sequels including paralyses and St.\r\nVitus's dance.\r\n\r\n=Determination of Scarlet Fever.=--When beginning with vomiting,\r\nheadache, high fever, and sore throat, and followed in twenty-four\r\nhours with a general scarlet rash, this is not difficult; but\r\noccasionally other diseases present rashes, as indigestion, _grippe_,\r\nand German measles, which puzzle the most acute physicians. Measles\r\nmay be distinguished from scarlet fever in that measles appears first\r\non the face, the rash is patchy or blotchy, and does not show for\r\nthree to four days after the beginning of the sickness. The patient\r\nseems to have a bad cold, with cough, running at the nose, and sore\r\neyes. German measles is mild, and while the rash may look something\r\nlike that of scarlet fever, the patient does not seem generally ill,\r\nis hardly affected at all, though rarely troubled with slight catarrh\r\nof the nose. In no sickness are the services of a physician more\r\nnecessary than in scarlet fever; first, to determine the existence of\r\nthe disease, and then to prevent or combat the complications which\r\noften approach insidiously.\r\n\r\n=Outlook.=--The average death rate of scarlet fever is about ten per\r\ncent. It is very fatal in children about a year old, and most of the\r\ndeaths occur in those under the age of six. But the mortality varies\r\ngreatly at different times and in different epidemics. In 1904-5, in\r\nmany parts of the United States, the disease was very prevalent and\r\ncorrespondingly mild, and deaths were rare.\r\n\r\n=Duration of Contagion.=--The disease is commonly considered\r\ncontagious only so long as peeling of the skin lasts. But it seems\r\nprobable that any catarrhal secretion from the nose, throat, or ear is\r\ncapable of communicating the germs from a patient to another person\r\nfor many days after other evidences of the disease are past. Scarlet\r\nfever patients should always be isolated for as long a period as six\r\nweeks--and better eight weeks--without regard to any shorter duration\r\nof peeling, and if peeling continues longer, so should the isolation.\r\n\r\n=Treatment.=--In case a physician is unobtainable the patient must be\r\nput to bed in the most airy, sunshiny room, which should be heated to\r\n70 deg. F., and from which all the unnecessary movables should be taken\r\nout before the entrance of the patient. A flannel nightgown and light\r\nbed clothing are desirable. The fever is best overcome by cold\r\nsponging, which at the same time diminishes the nervous symptoms, such\r\nas restlessness and delirium. The body is sponged--part at a\r\ntime--with water at the temperature of about 70 deg. F., after placing a\r\nsingle thickness of old cotton or linen wet with ice or cold water\r\n(better an ice cap) over the forehead. The part is thoroughly dried as\r\nsoon as sponged, and the process is repeated whenever the temperature\r\nis over 103 deg. F. There need be no fear that the patient may catch cold\r\nif only a portion of the body is exposed at any one time. If there is\r\nany chilliness following sponging, a bag or bottle containing hot\r\nwater may be placed at the feet. It is well that a rubber bag\r\ncontaining ice, or failing this a cold cloth, be kept continually on\r\nthe head while fever lasts. The throat should be sprayed hourly with a\r\nsolution of hydrogen peroxide (full strength) and the nose with the\r\nsame, diluted with an equal amount of water, three times a day. The\r\noutside of the throat it is wise to surround with an ice bag, or\r\nlacking this, a cold cloth frequently wet and covered with a piece of\r\noil silk (or rubber) and flannel.\r\n\r\nThe diet should consist of milk, broths, or thin gruels, and plenty of\r\nwater should be allowed. Sweet oil or carbolized vaseline should be\r\nrubbed over the whole body night and morning during the entire\r\nsickness and convalescence. The bowels must be kept regular by\r\ninjections or mild cathartics, and, after the fever subsides,\r\nvegetables, fruit, cereals, and milk may be permitted, together with\r\nmeat or eggs once daily. It is imperative for the nurse and also the\r\nmother to wear a gown and cap over the outside clothes, to be slipped\r\noff in the hall at the door of the sick room when leaving the latter.\r\n\r\n\r\n=MEASLES.=--Measles is a contagious disease, characterized by a\r\npreliminary stage of fever and catarrh of the eyes, nose, and throat,\r\nand followed by a general eruption on the skin. One attack practically\r\nprotects a person from another, yet, on the other hand, second attacks\r\noccur with extreme rarity. It is more contagious than scarlet fever,\r\nand isolation of a patient in a house is of less service in preventing\r\ncommunication to other inmates, whereas in scarlet fever half the\r\nnumber of susceptible children may escape the disease through this\r\nprecaution. The germs which cause measles perish rapidly, so that\r\ninfected clothes or other objects merely require a thorough airing to\r\nbe rendered safe, whereas in scarlet fever the danger of transmission\r\nof the contagion may lurk in infected clothing and other substances\r\nfor weeks, unless they are subjected to proper disinfection. A patient\r\nwith measles is capable of communicating the disorder from its onset,\r\nbefore the appearance of the rash, through the breath, discharges from\r\nthe nose and eyes, tears and saliva and all the secretions. At the end\r\nof the third week of the disease the patient is usually incapable of\r\ngiving the disease to others. Close contact with a patient is commonly\r\nnecessary for one to acquire the disease, but it is frequently claimed\r\nthat it is carried by a third person in the clothes, as by a nurse. It\r\nis infrequent in infants under six months, and most frequent between\r\nthe second and sixth year. Adults are attacked by measles more often\r\nthan by scarlet fever.\r\n\r\n=Development.=--A period of from seven to sixteen days after exposure\r\nto measles elapses before the disease becomes apparent.\r\n\r\n=Symptoms.=--The disease begins like a severe nasal catarrh with\r\nfever. The eyes are red and watery, the nose runs, and the throat is\r\nirritable, red, and sore, and there is some cough, with chilliness and\r\nmuscular soreness. The fever, higher at night, varies from 102 deg. to\r\n104 deg. F., and the pulse ranges from 100 to 120. There is often marked\r\ndrowsiness for a day or two before the rash appears. Coated tongue,\r\nloss of appetite, occasional vomiting, and thirst are present during\r\nthis period. The appearance of minute, whitish spots, surrounded by a\r\nred zone, may often be seen in the inside of the mouth opposite the\r\nback teeth for some days before the eruption occurs.\r\n\r\nThe preliminary period, when the patient seems to be suffering with a\r\nbad cold, lasts for four days usually, and on the evening of the\r\nfourth day the rash breaks out. It first appears on the face and then\r\nspreads to the chest, trunk, and limbs. Two days are generally\r\nrequired for the complete development of the rash; it remains thus in\r\nfull bloom for about two days more, then begins to subside, fading\r\ncompletely in another two days--six days in all.\r\n\r\nThe rash appears as bright-red, slightly raised blotches on the face,\r\nwhich is generally somewhat swollen. The same rash extends to the\r\nabdomen, back, and limbs. Between the mottled, red rash may be seen\r\nthe natural color of the skin. At this time the cough may be hoarse\r\nand incessant, and the eyes extremely sensitive to light. The fever\r\nand other symptoms abate when the rash subsides, and well-marked\r\nscaling of the skin occurs.\r\n\r\n=Complications and Sequels.=--Severe bronchitis, pneumonia, croup,\r\nlaryngitis, sore eyes, ear abscess and deafness, violent diarrhea,\r\nconvulsions, and, as a late result, consumption sometimes accompany or\r\nfollow measles. For the consideration of these disorders, see special\r\narticles in other parts of this work.\r\n\r\n=Outlook.=--The vast majority of healthy patients over two years old\r\nrecover from measles completely. Younger children, or those suffering\r\nfrom other diseases, may die through some of the complications\r\naffecting the lungs. The disease is peculiarly fatal in some epidemics\r\noccurring among those living in unhygienic surroundings, and in\r\ncommunities unaccustomed to the ravages of measles. Thus, in an\r\nepidemic attacking the Fiji Islanders, over one-quarter of the whole\r\npopulation (150,000) died of measles in 1875. Measles is more severe\r\nin adults than in children.\r\n\r\n=Diagnosis.=--For one not familiar with the characteristic rash a\r\nwritten description of it will not suffice for the certain recognition\r\nof the disease, but if the long preliminary period of catarrh and\r\nfever, and the appearance of the eruption on the fourth day, be taken\r\ninto account--together with the existence of sore eyes and hoarse,\r\nhard cough--the determination of the presence of measles will not be\r\ndifficult in most cases.\r\n\r\n=Treatment.=--The patient should be put to bed in a darkened,\r\nwell-ventilated room at a temperature of 68 deg. to 70 deg. F. While by\r\nisolation of the patient we may often fail to prevent the occurrence\r\nof measles in other susceptible persons in the same house, because of\r\nthe very infectious character of the disease, and because it is\r\nprobable that they have already been exposed during the early stages\r\nwhen measles was not suspected, yet all possible precautions should be\r\nadopted promptly. For this reason other children in the house should\r\nbe kept from school and away from their companions, and they ought\r\nnot to be sent away from home to spread the disease elsewhere. The\r\nbowels should be kept regular by soapsuds injections or by mild\r\ncathartics, as a Seidlitz powder. If the fever is over 103 deg. F. and is\r\naccompanied by much distress and restlessness, children may be sponged\r\nwith tepid water, and adults with water at 80 deg. F., every two hours or\r\nso as directed under scarlet fever. When cough is incessant or the\r\nrash does not come out well, there is nothing better than the hot\r\npack.\r\n\r\nThe patient is stripped and wrapped from feet to neck in a blanket\r\nwrung out of hot water containing two teaspoonfuls of mustard stirred\r\ninto a gallon of water. This is then covered with two dry blankets and\r\nthe patient allowed to remain in the blankets for two or three hours,\r\nwhen the application may be repeated. It is well to keep a cold cloth\r\non the head during the process. Cough is also relieved by a mixture\r\ncontaining syrup of ipecac, twenty drops; paregoric, one teaspoonful,\r\nfor an adult (or one-third the dose for a child of six), which should\r\nbe given in one-quarter glass of water and may be repeated every two\r\nhours. If there is hoarseness, the neck should be rubbed with a\r\nmixture of sweet oil, two parts; and oil of turpentine, one part, and\r\ncovered with a flannel bandage. The cough mixture will tend to relieve\r\nthis condition also. A solution of boric acid (ten grains of boric\r\nacid to the ounce of water) is to be dropped in both eyes every two\r\nhours with a medicine dropper. Although usually mild, the eye symptoms\r\nmay be very severe and require special treatment, and considerably\r\nimpaired vision may be the ultimate result. Severe diarrhea is\r\ncombated with bismuth subnitrate, one-quarter teaspoonful, every three\r\nhours. For adults, the diet consists of milk, broths, gruels, and raw\r\neggs. Young children living on milk mixtures should receive the\r\nmixture to which they are accustomed, diluted one-half with barley\r\nwater. Nourishment must be given every two hours except during sleep.\r\nThe patient should be ten days in bed, and should remain three days in\r\nhis room after getting up (or three weeks in all, if there are others\r\nwho may contract measles in the house), and after leaving his room\r\nshould stay in the house a week longer. The principal danger after an\r\nattack of measles is of lung trouble--pneumonia or tuberculosis\r\n(consumption)--and the greatest care should be exercised to avoid\r\nexposure to the wet or to cold draughts.\r\n\r\n\r\n=GERMAN MEASLES= (_Roetheln_).--German measles is related neither to\r\nmeasles nor scarlet fever, but resembles them both to a certain\r\nextent--more closely the former in most cases. It is a distinct\r\ndisease, and persons who have had both measles and scarlet fever are\r\nstill susceptible to German measles. One attack of German measles\r\nusually protects the patient from another. Adults, who have not been\r\npreviously attacked, are almost as liable to German measles as\r\nchildren, but it is rare that infants acquire the disease. It is a\r\nvery contagious disorder--but not so much so as true measles--and\r\noften occurs in widespread epidemics. The breath and emanations from\r\nthe skin transmit the _contagium_ from the appearance of the first\r\nsymptom to the disappearance of the eruption.\r\n\r\n=Development.=--The period elapsing after exposure to German measles\r\nand before the appearance of the symptoms varies greatly--usually\r\nabout two weeks; it may vary from five to eighteen days.\r\n\r\n=Symptoms.=--The rash may be the first sign of the disease and more\r\nfrequently is so in children. In others, for a day or two preceding\r\nthe eruption, there may be headache, soreness, and redness of the\r\nthroat, the appearance of red spots on the upper surface of the back\r\nof the mouth, chilliness, soreness in the muscles, loss of appetite,\r\nwatering of the eyes. Catarrhal symptoms are most generally absent, an\r\nimportant point in diagnosis. When present, they are always mild.\r\nThese preliminary symptoms, if present, are much milder and of shorter\r\nduration than in measles, where they last for four days before the\r\nrash appears; and the hard, persistent cough of measles is absent in\r\nGerman measles. Also, while there is sore throat in the latter, there\r\nis not the severe form with swollen tonsils covered with white spots\r\nso often seen in scarlet fever. Fever is sometimes absent in German\r\nmeasles; usually it ranges about 100 deg. F., rarely over 102 deg. F. Thus,\r\nGerman measles differs markedly from both scarlet fever and measles\r\nproper. The rash usually appears first on the face, then on the chest,\r\nand finally covers the whole body, in the space of a few\r\nhours--twenty-four hours at most. The eruption takes the form of\r\nrose-red, round or oval, slightly raised spots--from the size of a pin\r\nhead to that of a pea--sometimes running together into uniform\r\nredness, as in scarlet fever. The rash remains fully developed for\r\nabout two days, and often changes into a coppery hue as it gradually\r\nfades away. There are often lumps--enlarged glands--to be felt under\r\nthe jaw, on the sides and back of the neck, which occur more commonly\r\nin German than in true measles. The glands at the back of the neck are\r\nthe most characteristic. They are enlarged in about two-thirds of the\r\ncases.\r\n\r\n=Determination.=--The diagnosis or determination of the existence of\r\nmeasles must be made, in the absence of a physician, on the general\r\nsymptoms rather than on the rash, which requires experience for its\r\nrecognition and is subject to great variations in appearance, at one\r\ntime simulating measles, at another scarlet fever.\r\n\r\nGerman measles differs from true measles in the following points: the\r\npreliminary period--before the rash--is mild, short, or absent; fever\r\nis mild or absent; the cold in the nose and eyes and cough are slight\r\nor may be absent, as contrasted with these symptoms in measles, while\r\nthe enlarged glands in the neck are more pronounced than in measles.\r\nThe onset of German measles is not so sudden as in scarlet fever and\r\nnot accompanied with vomiting as in the latter, while the sore throat\r\nand fever are much milder in German measles. The peeling, which is so\r\nprominent in scarlet fever with the disappearance of the rash, is not\r\ninfrequently present. It may be absent. Its presence or absence seems\r\nto depend upon the severity of the eruption. The desquamation when\r\npresent is finer than in either measles or scarlet fever.\r\n\r\n=Outlook.=--Recovery from German measles is the invariable rule, and\r\nwithout complications or delay.\r\n\r\n=Treatment.=--Little or no treatment is required. The patient should\r\nremain in bed in a darkened room on a liquid diet while fever lasts,\r\nand be isolated from others indoors until all signs of the eruption\r\nare passed. The eyes should be treated with boric acid as in measles;\r\nthe diet, during the fever, consisting of milk, broths, thin cereals,\r\nbeef juice, raw eggs or eggnog, for adults and older children; while\r\ninfants should have their milk mixture diluted one-half with barley\r\nwater. A bath and fresh clothing for the patient, and thorough\r\ncleansing and airing of the sick room and clothing are usually\r\nsufficient after the passing of the disease without chemical\r\ndisinfection.\r\n\r\n\r\n=SMALLPOX.=--Smallpox is one of the most contagious diseases known. It\r\nis extremely rare for anyone exposed to the disease to escape its\r\nonslaught unless previously protected by vaccination or by a former\r\nattack of the disease. One is absolutely safe from acquiring smallpox\r\nif recently and successfully vaccinated, and thus has one of the most\r\nfrightful and fatal scourges to which mankind has ever been subject\r\nbeen robbed of its dangers. The _contagium_ is probably derived\r\nentirely from the scales and particles of skin escaping from smallpox\r\npatients, and in the year 1905-6 the true germ of the disease was\r\ndiscovered by Councilman, of Boston. It is not necessary to come in\r\ndirect contact with a patient to contract the disease, as the\r\n_contagium_ may be transmitted some little distance through the air,\r\npossibly even outside of the sick room. One attack almost invariably\r\nprotects against another. All ages are liable to smallpox; it is\r\nparticularly fatal in young children, and during certain epidemics has\r\nproved more so in colored than in white people.\r\n\r\n=Development.=--A period of ten or twelve days usually elapses after\r\nexposure to smallpox before the appearance of the first symptoms of\r\nthe disease. This period may vary, however, from nine to fifteen days.\r\n\r\n=Symptoms.=--There is a preliminary period of from twenty-four to\r\nforty-eight hours after the beginning of the disease before an\r\neruption occurs. The onset is ushered in by a set of symptoms\r\nsimulating those seen in severe _grippe_, for which smallpox is often\r\nmistaken at this time. The patient is suddenly seized with a chill,\r\nsevere pains in the head, back, and limbs, loss of appetite and\r\nvomiting, dizziness on sitting up, and fever--103 deg. to 105 deg. F. In young\r\nchildren convulsions often take the place of the chill seen in\r\nadults. On the second day a rash often appears on the lower part of\r\nthe belly, thighs, and armpits, which may resemble that characteristic\r\nof measles or scarlet fever, but does not last for over a day or two.\r\nIt is very evanescent and, consequently, rarely seen. Diarrhea often\r\noccurs, as well as vomiting, particularly in children. On the evening\r\nof the fourth day the true eruption usually appears; first on the\r\nforehead or face, and then on the arms, hands, and legs, palms, and\r\nsoles. The eruption takes successively four forms: first, red, feeling\r\nlike hard pimples or like shot; then, on the second or third day of\r\nthe eruption, these pimples become tipped with little blisters with\r\ndepressed centers, and surrounded by a red blush. Two or three days\r\nlater the blisters are filled with \"matter\" or pus and present a\r\nyellowish appearance and are rounded on top. Finally, on about the\r\ntenth day of the eruption, the pustules dry up and the matter exudes,\r\nforming large, yellowish or brownish crusts, which, after a while,\r\ndrop off and leave red marks and, in severe cases, pitting. The fever\r\npreceding the eruption often disappears upon the appearance of the\r\nlatter and in mild cases does not reappear, but in severe forms the\r\ntemperature remains about 100 deg. F., and when the eruption is at its\r\nheight again mounts to 103 deg. to 105 deg. F., and gradually falls with\r\nconvalescence. The eruption is most marked on the face, hands, and\r\nforearms, and occurs less thickly on the body. It appears also in the\r\nmouth and throat and when fully developed on the face gives rise to\r\npain and considerable swelling and distortion of the features, so that\r\nthe eyes are closed and the patient becomes frightfully disfigured and\r\nwell-nigh unrecognizable. Delirium is common at this time, and\r\npatients need constant watching to prevent their escape from bed. In\r\nthe severe forms the separate eruptive points run together so that the\r\nface and hands present one distorted mass of soreness, swelling, and\r\ncrusting. In these, pitting invariably follows, while in those cases\r\nwhere the eruption remains distinct, pitting is not certain to occur.\r\nA still worse form is that styled \"black smallpox,\" in which the skin\r\nbecomes of a dark-purplish hue, from the fact that each pustule is a\r\nsmall blood blister, and bleeding occurs from the nose, mouth, etc.\r\nThese cases are almost, without exception, fatal in five to six days.\r\n\r\nThe patient may say that the eruption was the first symptom he\r\nobserved. This was particularly noticed in negroes, many of whom had\r\nnever been vaccinated. The eruption may exhibit but a dozen or so\r\npoints, especially about the forehead, wrists, palms, and soles. After\r\nthe first four days the fever and all the disagreeable symptoms may\r\nsubside, and the patient may feel absolutely well. The eruption,\r\nhowever, passes through the stages mentioned, although but half the\r\ntime may be occupied by the changes; five or six days instead of ten\r\nto twelve for crusts to form. In such cases the death rate has been\r\nexceedingly low, although it is perfectly possible for a person to\r\ncontract the most severe smallpox from one of these mild (and often\r\nunrecognized) cases, as has unfortunately happened. Smallpox occurring\r\nafter successful vaccination resembles, in its characteristics, the\r\ncases just described, and unless vaccination had been done many years\r\npreviously, the results are almost always favorable as regards life\r\nand absence of pitting.\r\n\r\n=Detection.=--Smallpox is often mistaken for chickenpox, or some of\r\nthe skin diseases, in its mild forms. The reader is referred to the\r\narticle on chickenpox for a consideration of this matter. The mild\r\ntype should be treated just as rigidly as severe cases with regard to\r\nisolation and quarantine, being more dangerous to the community\r\nbecause lightly judged and not stimulating to the adoption of\r\nnecessary precautions. The preliminary fever and other symptoms\r\npeculiar to smallpox will generally serve to determine the true nature\r\nof the disease, since these do not occur in simple eruptions on the\r\nskin. The general symptoms and course of smallpox must guide the\r\nlayman rather than the appearance of the eruption, which requires\r\neducated skill and experience to recognize. Chickenpox in an adult is\r\nless common than in children. Smallpox is very rare in one who has\r\nsuffered from a previous attack of the disease or in one who has been\r\nsuccessfully vaccinated within a few years.\r\n\r\n=Outlook.=--The death rate of smallpox in those who have been\r\npreviously vaccinated at a comparatively recent date, or in\r\nvarioloid, as it is called when thus modified by vaccination, is only\r\n1.2 per cent. There are, however, severe cases following vaccinations\r\ndone many years previous to the attack of smallpox. While these cannot\r\nbe called varioloid, yet the death rate is much lower than in smallpox\r\noccurring in the unvaccinated. Thus, before the mild epidemic of 1894\r\nthe death rate in the vaccinated was sixteen per cent; since 1894 it\r\nhas been only seven per cent; while in the unvaccinated before 1894 it\r\nwas fifty-eight per cent; and since that date it has been but\r\nseventeen per cent, as reported by Welch from the statistics of 5,000\r\ncases in the Philadelphia Municipal Hospital.\r\n\r\n=Complications.=--While a variety of disorders may follow in the\r\ncourse of smallpox, complications are not very frequent in even severe\r\ncases. Inflammation of the eyelids is very common, however, and also\r\nboils in the later stages. Delirium and convulsions in children are\r\nalso frequent, as well as diarrhea; but these may almost be regarded\r\nas natural accompaniments of the disease. Among the less common\r\ncomplications are: laryngitis, pneumonia, diseases of the heart,\r\ninsanity, paralysis, various skin eruptions, inflammation of the\r\njoints and of the eyes and ears, and baldness.\r\n\r\n=Treatment.=--Prevention is of greatest importance. Vaccination stands\r\nalone as the most effective preventive measure in smallpox, and as\r\nsuch has no rival in the whole domain of medicine. The modern method\r\nincludes the inoculation of a human being with matter taken from one\r\nof the eruptive points on the body of a calf suffering with cowpox.\r\nWhether cowpox is a modified form of smallpox or a distinct disease is\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\nThe period of protection afforded by a successful vaccination is\r\nuncertain, because it varies with different individuals. In a general\r\nway immunity for about four or five years is thus secured; ten or\r\ntwelve years after vaccination the protection is certainly lost and\r\nsmallpox may be then acquired. Every individual should be vaccinated\r\nbetween the second and third month after birth, and between the ages\r\nof ten and twelve, and at other times whenever an epidemic threatens.\r\nAn unvaccinated person should be vaccinated and revaccinated, until\r\nthe result is successful, as immunity to vaccination in an\r\nunvaccinated person is practically unknown. When unsuccessful, the\r\nvaccine matter or the technique is faulty. A person continuously\r\nexposed to smallpox should be vaccinated every few weeks--if\r\nunsuccessful, no harm or suffering follow; if successful, it proves\r\nliability to smallpox. A person previously vaccinated successfully may\r\n\"take\" again at any time after four or five years, and, in event of\r\npossible exposure to smallpox, should be revaccinated several times\r\nwithin a few weeks--if the vaccination does not \"take\"--before the\r\nattempt is given up. An unvaccinated person, who has been exposed to\r\nsmallpox, can often escape the disease if successfully vaccinated\r\nwithin three days from the date of the exposure, but is not sure to\r\ndo so.\r\n\r\nDiseases are not introduced with vaccination now that the vaccine\r\nmatter is taken from calves and not from the human being, as formerly.\r\nMost of the trouble and inflammation of the vaccinated part following\r\nvaccination may be avoided by cleanliness and proper care in\r\nvaccinating.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of a physician, vaccination may be properly done by any\r\nintelligent person when the circumstances demand it. Vaccination is\r\nusually performed upon the outside of the arm, a few inches below the\r\nshoulder, in the depression situated in that region. If done on the\r\nleg, the vaccination is apt to be much more troublesome and may\r\nconfine the patient to bed. The arm should be thoroughly washed in\r\nsoap and warm water, from shoulder to elbow, and then in alcohol\r\ndiluted one-third with water. When this has evaporated (without\r\nrubbing), the dry arm is scratched lightly with a cold needle which\r\nhas previously been held in a flame and its point heated red hot. The\r\npoint must thereafter not be touched with anything until the skin is\r\nscratched with it. The object is not to draw blood, but to remove the\r\nouter layer of skin, over an area about one-fourth of an inch square,\r\nso that it appears red and moist but not bleeding. This is\r\naccomplished by very light scratching in various directions. Another\r\nspot, about an inch or two below, may be similarly treated. Then\r\nvaccine matter, if liquid, is squirted on the raw spots, or, if dried\r\non points, the ivory point is dipped in water which has been boiled\r\nand cooled, and rubbed thoroughly over the raw places. The arm must\r\nremain bare and the vaccination mark untouched until the surface of\r\nthe raw spot is perfectly dry, which may take half an hour. A piece of\r\nsterilized surgical gauze, reaching halfway about the arm and kept in\r\nplace with strips of adhesive plaster (or an absolutely clean\r\nhandkerchief bound about the arm, and held by sewing or safety pins),\r\nought to cover the vaccination for three days. After this time the\r\nsore must only come in contact with soft and clean old cotton or\r\nlinen, which may be daily pinned in the sleeve of the under garment.\r\nIf the scab is knocked off and an open sore results it should be\r\ntreated like any wound.\r\n\r\nIf the vaccination \"takes,\" it passes through several stages. On the\r\nthird day following vaccination a red pimple forms at the point of\r\nintroduction of the matter, which is surrounded by a circle of\r\nredness. Some little fever may occur. On the fifth day a blister or\r\npimple containing clear fluid with a depressed center is seen, and a\r\ncertain amount of hard swelling, itchiness, and pain is present about\r\nthe vaccination. A sore lump (gland) is often felt under the arm. The\r\nfull development is reached by the eighth day, when the pimple is full\r\nand rounded and contains \"matter,\" and is surrounded by a large area\r\nof redness. From the eleventh day the vaccination sore dries, and a\r\nbrown scab forms over it about the end of the fourteenth day, and the\r\nredness and swelling gradually depart. At the end of about three weeks\r\nthe scab drops off, leaving a pitted scar or mark. Not infrequently\r\nthe vaccination results in a very slight pimple and redness, which\r\npasses through the various stages described, in a week or ten days, in\r\nwhich case the vaccination should be repeated. Unless the vaccination\r\nfollows very closely the course described, it cannot be regarded as\r\nsuccessful, although after the first one or two vaccinations the\r\nresult is often not so severe, and the time of completion of the\r\nvarious stages somewhat shortened.\r\n\r\nRarely an eruption, resembling that at the vaccination site, appears\r\non the vaccinated limb and even becomes general upon the body, due to\r\nurticaria or to inoculation, through scratching.\r\n\r\nThe special treatment of an attack of smallpox is largely a matter of\r\ncareful nursing. A physician or nurse can scarcely lay claim to any\r\ngreat degree of heroism in caring for smallpox patients, as there is\r\nno danger of contracting the disease providing a successful\r\nvaccination has been recently performed upon them. The patient should\r\nbe quarantined in an isolated building, and all unnecessary articles\r\nshould be removed from the sick room, in the way of carpets and other\r\nfurnishings. It is well that the room be darkened to save irritation\r\nof the eyes. The diet should be liquid: milk, broths, and gruels.\r\nLaudanum, fifteen drops, or paregoric, one tablespoonful in water,\r\nmay be given to adults, once in three hours, to relieve pain during\r\nthe first few days. Sponging throughout the course of the disease is\r\nessential; first, with cool water, as directed for scarlet fever, with\r\nthe use of cold on the head to relieve the itching, fever, and\r\ndelirium. The cold pack is still more efficient. To give this, the\r\npatient is wrapped in a sheet wrung out in water at a temperature\r\nbetween 68 deg. and 75 deg. F. The sheet surrounds the naked body from feet to\r\nneck, and is tucked between the legs and between the body and arms;\r\nthe whole is then covered with a dry blanket, and a cold, wet cloth or\r\nice cap is placed upon the head. The patient may be permitted to\r\nremain in the pack for an hour, when it may be renewed, if necessary,\r\nto allay fever and restlessness; otherwise it may be discontinued. The\r\ncold sponging or cold pack are indicated when the temperature is over\r\n102.5 deg. F., and when with fever there are restlessness and delirium.\r\nGreat cleanliness is important throughout the disease; the bedclothes\r\nshould be changed daily and the patient sponged two or three times\r\ndaily with warm water, unless fever is high. Cloths wet with cold\r\ncarbolic-acid solution (one-half teaspoonful to the pint of hot water)\r\nshould be kept continuously on the face and hands. Holes are cut in\r\nthe face mask for the eyes, nose, and mouth, and the whole covered\r\nwith a similar piece of oil silk to keep in the moisture. Such\r\napplications give much relief, and to some extent prevent pitting.\r\nThe hair must be cut short, and crusts on the scalp treated with\r\nfrequent sponging and applications of carbolized vaseline, to soften\r\nthem and hasten their falling. The boric-acid solution should be\r\ndropped into the eyes as recommended for measles, and the throat\r\nsprayed every few hours with Dobell's solution. Diarrhea in adults may\r\nbe checked with teaspoonful doses of paregoric given hourly in water.\r\nVaseline and cloths used on a patient must not be employed on another,\r\nas boils are thus readily propagated. All clothing, dishes, etc.,\r\ncoming in contact with a patient must be boiled, or soaked in a\r\ntwo-per cent carbolic-acid solution for twenty-four hours, or burned.\r\nWhen the patient is entirely free from scabs, after bathing and\r\nputting on disinfected or new clothes outside of the sick room, he is\r\nfit to reenter the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n=CHICKENPOX.=--Chickenpox is a contagious disease, chiefly attacking\r\nchildren. While it resembles smallpox in some respects, at times\r\nsimulating the latter so closely as to puzzle physicians, it is a\r\ndistinct disease and is in no way related to smallpox. This is shown\r\nby the fact that chickenpox sometimes attacks a patient suffering\r\nwith, or recovering from, smallpox. Neither do vaccination nor a\r\nprevious attack of smallpox protect an individual from chickenpox.\r\nChickenpox is not common in adults, and its apparent presence in a\r\ngrown person should awaken the liveliest suspicion lest the case be\r\none of smallpox, since this mistake has been frequently made, and\r\nwith disastrous results, during an epidemic of mild smallpox. One\r\nattack of chickenpox usually protects against another, but two or\r\nthree attacks in the same individual are not unknown. The disease may\r\nbe transmitted from the patient to another person from the time of the\r\nfirst symptom until the disappearance of the eruption. The disease\r\nordinarily occurs in epidemics, but occasionally in isolated cases.\r\n\r\n=Development.=--A period of two weeks commonly elapses after exposure\r\nto the disease before the appearance of the first symptom of\r\nchickenpox, but this period may vary from thirteen to twenty-one days.\r\n\r\n=Symptoms.=--The characteristic eruption is often the first warning of\r\nchickenpox, but in some cases there may be a preliminary period of\r\ndiscomfort, lasting for a few hours, before the appearance of the\r\nrash; particularly in adults, in whom the premonitory symptoms may be\r\nquite severe. Thus, there may be chilliness, nausea, and even\r\nvomiting, rarely convulsions in infants, pain in the head and limbs,\r\nand slight fever (99 deg. to 102 deg. F.) at this time. The eruption shows\r\nfirst on the body, in most cases, especially the back. It consists of\r\nsmall red pimples, which rapidly develop into pearly looking blisters\r\nabout as large as a pea to that of the finger nail, and are sometimes\r\nsurrounded by a red blush on the skin. These blisters vary in number,\r\nfrom a dozen or so to two hundred. They do not run together, and in\r\nthree to four days dry up, become shriveled and puckered, and covered\r\nwith a dark-brown or blackish crust, and drop off, leaving only\r\ntemporary red spots in most cases. The fever usually continues during\r\nthe eruption. During the first few days successive fresh crops of\r\nfresh pimples and blisters appear, so that while the first crop is\r\ndrying the next may be in full development. This forms one of its\r\ndistinguishing features when chickenpox is compared with smallpox. In\r\nchickenpox the eruption is seen on the unexposed skin chiefly, but may\r\noccur on the scalp and forehead, and even on the palms, soles,\r\nforearms, and face. In many cases the eruption is found in the mouth,\r\non its roof, and the inside of the cheeks. The blisters rarely contain\r\n\"matter\" or pus, as in smallpox, unless they are scratched. Scratching\r\nmay lead to the formation of ugly scars and should be prevented,\r\nespecially when the eruption is on the face. Pitting rarely occurs.\r\n\r\n=Determination.=--The discrimination between chickenpox and smallpox\r\nis sometimes extremely puzzling and demands the skill of an\r\nexperienced physician. When one is unavailable, the following points\r\nmay serve to distinguish the two disorders: smallpox usually begins\r\nlike a severe attack of _grippe_, with pain in the back and head,\r\ngeneral pains and nausea or vomiting, with high fever (103 deg. to 104 deg.\r\nF.) These last two or three days, and may completely subside when the\r\nrash appears. In chickenpox preliminary discomfort is absent, or lasts\r\nbut a few hours before the eruption. The eruption of smallpox usually\r\noccurs first on the forehead, near the hair, or on the palms of the\r\nhands, soles of the feet, the arms and legs, but is usually sparse on\r\nthe body. The eruption appears about the same time in smallpox and not\r\nin successive crops, as in chickenpox. Chickenpox is more commonly a\r\ndisease of childhood; smallpox attacks all ages. The crusts in\r\nchickenpox are thin, and appear in four or five days, while those of\r\nsmallpox are large and yellow, and occur after ten or twelve days.\r\n\r\n=Outlook.=--Chickenpox almost invariably results in a rapid and speedy\r\nrecovery without complications or sequels. The young patients often\r\nfeel well throughout the attack, which lasts from eight to twelve\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n=Treatment.=--Children should be kept in bed during the eruptive stage\r\nuntil the blisters have dried. To prevent scratching, the calamine\r\nlotion may be used (Vol. II, p. 145), or carbolized vaseline, or\r\nbathing with a solution of baking soda, one teaspoonful to the pint of\r\ntepid water. The diet should be that recommended for German measles.\r\nPatients should be kept in the house and isolated until all signs of\r\nthe eruption are passed, and then receive a good bath and fresh\r\nclothing before mingling with others. The sick room should be\r\nthoroughly cleaned and aired; thorough chemical disinfection is not\r\nessential.\r\n\r\nThe services of a physician are always desirable in order that it may\r\nbe positively determined that the disease is not a mild form of\r\nsmallpox.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n=Infectious Diseases=\r\n\r\n_Typhoid Fever--How it is Contracted--Complications and Sequels--Rest,\r\nDiet, and Bathing the Requisites--Mumps--Whooping Cough--Erysipelas._\r\n\r\n\r\n=TYPHOID FEVER (ENTERIC FEVER).=--Through ignorance which prevailed\r\nbefore the discovery of the germ of typhoid fever and exact methods\r\nfor determining the presence of the same, the term was loosely applied\r\nand is to this day. Thus mild forms of typhoid are called gastric\r\nfever, slow fever, malarial fever, nervous fever, etc., all true\r\ntyphoid in most cases; while typhoid fever, common to certain\r\nlocalities and differing in some respects from the typical form, is\r\noften named after the locality in which it occurs, as the \"mountain\r\nfever\" common to the elevated regions of the western United States.\r\nThis want of information is apt to prevail in regions remote from\r\nmedical centers, and leads to neglect of the necessary strict measures\r\nfor the protection of neighboring communities, for the excretion of\r\none typhoid patient has led to thousands of cases and hundreds of\r\ndeaths.\r\n\r\nTyphoid fever is a communicable disease caused by a germ which attacks\r\nthe intestines chiefly, but also invades the blood, and at times all\r\nthe other parts of the body, and is characterized by continued fever,\r\nan eruption, tenderness and distention of the bowels, and generally\r\ndiarrhea. It is common to all parts of the earth in the temperate\r\nzones, and occurs more frequently from July to December in the north\r\ntemperate zone, from February to July in the south temperate zone. It\r\nis most prevalent in the late summer and autumn months and after a\r\nhot, dry summer. Individuals between the ages of fifteen and thirty\r\nare more prone to typhoid fever, but no age is exempt. The sexes are\r\nalmost equally liable to the disease, although it is said that for\r\nevery four female cases there are five male cases. The robust succumb\r\nas readily as the weak.\r\n\r\n=Cause and Modes of Communication.=--While the typhoid germ is always\r\nthe immediate cause, yet it is brought in contact with the body in\r\nvarious ways. Contamination of water supply through bad drainage is\r\nthe principal source of epidemics of typhoid. Before carefully\r\nprotected public water supplies were in vogue in Massachusetts, there\r\nwere ninety-two deaths from typhoid fever in 100,000 inhabitants,\r\nwhile thirty-five years after town water supplies became the rule,\r\nthere were only nineteen deaths for the same population. Whenever\r\ntyphoid is prevalent, the water used for drinking and all other\r\nhousehold purposes should be boiled, and uncooked food should be\r\navoided. Flies are carriers of typhoid germs by lighting on the nose,\r\nthe mouth, and the discharges of typhoid patients, and then conveying\r\nthe germs to food, green vegetables, and milk. Cooking the food,\r\npreventing contact of flies with the patients, and keeping flies out\r\nof human habitations becomes imperative. Milk is a source of contagion\r\nthrough contaminated water used to wash cans, or to adulterate it, or\r\nthrough handling of it by patients or those who have come in contact\r\nwith patients. Oysters growing in the mouths of rivers and near the\r\noutlets of drains and sewers are carriers of typhoid germs, and, if\r\neaten raw, sometimes communicate typhoid fever. Dust is an occasional\r\nmedium of communication of the germ. It is probable, however, that the\r\ngerm always enters the body by being swallowed with food or drink, and\r\ndoes not enter through the lungs. There is little doubt on this point.\r\nIce may harbor the germ for many months, for freezing does not kill\r\nit, and epidemics have been traced to this source. Clothing, wood,\r\nutensils, door handles, etc., which have been contaminated by contact\r\nwith discharges from patients, may also prove mediums of communication\r\nof the typhoid germ to healthy individuals. Typhoid germs escape from\r\npatients sick with the disease chiefly in the bowel discharges and\r\nurine, sometimes in the sweat, saliva, and vomited matter.\r\n\r\nSewer gas and emanations from sewage and filth will not communicate\r\ntyphoid fever directly, but the latter afford nutriment for the growth\r\nof the germ, and after becoming infected, may eventually come in\r\ncontact with drinking water or food, and so prove dangerous. Improper\r\ncare of discharges of excrement and urine--with the assistance of\r\nflies--are responsible for the enormous typhoid epidemics in military\r\ncamps, so that in the late Spanish-American War one-fifth of all our\r\nsoldiers in camp contracted the disease. In the upper layers of the\r\nsoil typhoid germs may live for six months through frosts and thaws.\r\nThe disease is preventable, and will probably be stamped out in time.\r\nIn some of the most thickly populated cities in the world, as in\r\nVienna, its occurrence is most infrequent, owing to intelligent\r\nsanitary control and pure water supply, while in the most salubrious\r\ncountry districts its inroads are the most serious and fatal through\r\nignorance and carelessness.\r\n\r\n=Development.=--From eight to twenty-three days elapse from the time\r\nof entrance of typhoid germs into the body before the patient is taken\r\nsick. One attack usually protects one against another, but two or\r\nthree attacks are not unheard of in the same person.\r\n\r\n=Symptoms.=--Typhoid fever is subject to infinite variations, and it\r\nwill here be possible only to outline what may be called a typical\r\ncase. In a work of this kind the preliminary symptoms are of most\r\nimportance in warning one of the probability of an attack, so that the\r\nprospective patient can govern himself accordingly, as in no other\r\ndisease is rest in bed of more value. Patients who persist in walking\r\nabout with typhoid fever for the first week or so are most likely to\r\ndie of the disease.\r\n\r\nThe average duration of the disease is about one month. During the\r\nfirst week the onset is gradual, the temperature mounting a little\r\nhigher each day--as 99.5 deg. F. the first evening, 101 deg. the second, 102 deg.\r\nthe fourth, 104 deg. the fifth, 105 deg. the sixth, and 105.5 deg. the seventh. In\r\nthe morning of each day the temperature is usually about a degree or\r\nmore lower than that of the previous night. From the end of the first\r\nweek to the beginning of the third the temperature remains at its\r\nhighest point, being about the same each evening and falling one or\r\ntwo degrees in the morning. During the third week the temperature\r\ngradually falls, the highest point each evening being a degree or so\r\nlower than the previous day, while in the fourth week the temperature\r\nmay be below normal in the morning and a degree or so above normal at\r\nnight. So much for this symptom. After the entrance of typhoid germs\r\ninto the bowels and before the recognized onset of the disease, there\r\nmay be lassitude and disinclination for exertion. The disease begins\r\nwith headache, backache, loss of appetite, sometimes a chill in adults\r\nor a convulsion in children, soreness in the muscles, pains in the\r\nbelly, nosebleed, occasional vomiting, diarrhea, coated tongue, often\r\nsome cough, flushed face, pulse 100, gradually increasing as\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nThese symptoms are, to a considerable extent, characteristic of the\r\nbeginning of many acute diseases, but the gradual onset with constant\r\nfever, nosebleed, and looseness of the bowels are the most suggestive\r\nfeatures. Then, if at the end of the first week or ten days pink-red\r\nspots, about as large as a pin head, appear on the chest and belly to\r\nthe number of two or three to a dozen, of very numerously, and\r\ndisappear on pressure (only to return immediately), the existence of\r\ntyphoid fever is pretty certain. Headache is now intense. These rose\r\nspots--as they are called--often appear in crops during the second and\r\nthird weeks, lasting for a few days, then departing.\r\n\r\nDuring the second week there is often delirium and wandering at night;\r\nthe headache goes, but the patient is stupid and has a dusky, flushed\r\nface. The tongue becomes brownish in color, and its coat is cracked,\r\nand the teeth are covered with a brownish matter. The skin is\r\ngenerally red and the belly distended and tender. Diarrhea is often\r\npresent with three to ten discharges daily of a light-yellow, pea-soup\r\nnature, with a very offensive odor. Constipation throughout the\r\ndisease is, however, not uncommon in the more serious cases. The pulse\r\nranges from 80 to 120 a minute.\r\n\r\nDuring the third week, in cases of moderate severity, the general\r\ncondition begins to improve with lowering of the temperature, clearing\r\nof the tongue, and less frequent bowel movements. But in severe cases\r\nthe patient becomes weaker, with rapid, feeble pulse, ranging from 120\r\nto 140; stupor and muttering delirium; twitching of the wrists and\r\npicking at the bedclothes, with general trembling of the muscles in\r\nmoving; slow, hesitating speech, and emaciation; while the urine and\r\nfaeces may be passed unconsciously in bed. Occasionally the patient\r\nwith delirium may require watching to prevent him from getting out of\r\nbed and injuring himself. He may appear insane.\r\n\r\nDuring the fourth week, in favorable cases, the temperature falls to\r\nnormal in the morning, the pulse is reduced to 80 or 100, the diarrhea\r\nceases, and natural sleep returns.\r\n\r\nAmong the many and frequent variations from the type described, there\r\nmay be a fever prolonged for five or six weeks, with a good recovery.\r\nChills are not uncommon during the disease, sometimes owing to\r\ncomplications. Relapse, or a return of the fever and other symptoms\r\nall over again, occurs in about ten per cent of the cases. This may\r\nhappen more than once, and as many as five relapses have been recorded\r\nin one patient. A slight return of the fever for a day or two is often\r\nseen, owing to error in diet, excitement, or other imprudence after\r\napparent recovery. Death may occur at any time from the first week,\r\nowing to complications or the action of the poison of the disease.\r\nPneumonia, perforation of and bleeding from the bowels are the most\r\nfrequent dangerous complications. Unfavorable symptoms are continued\r\nhigh fever (105 deg. to 106 deg. F.), marked delirium, and trembling of the\r\nmuscles in early stages, and bleeding from the bowels; also intense\r\nand sudden pain with vomiting, indicating perforation of the\r\nintestines. The result is more apt to prove unfavorable in very fat\r\npatients, and especially so in persons who have walked about until the\r\nfever has become pronounced. Bleeding from the bowels occurs in four\r\nto six per cent of all cases and is responsible for fifteen per cent\r\nof the deaths; perforation of the bowels happens in one to two per\r\ncent of all cases and occasions ten per cent of the deaths.\r\n\r\n=Detection.=--It is impossible for the layman to determine the\r\nexistence of typhoid fever in any given patient absolutely, but when\r\nthe symptoms follow the general course indicated above, a probability\r\nbecomes established. Unusual types are among the most difficult and\r\npuzzling cases which a physician has to diagnose, and he can rarely be\r\nabsolutely sure of the nature of any case before the end of the first\r\nweek or ten days, when examination of the blood offers an exact\r\nmethod of determining the presence of typhoid fever. Typhoid\r\nfever--especially where there are chills--is often thought to be\r\nmalaria, when occurring in malarial regions, and may be improperly\r\ncalled \"typhoid malaria.\" There is no such disease. Rarely typhoid\r\nfever and malaria coexist in the same person, and while this was not\r\nuncommon in the soldiers returning from Cuba and Porto Rico, it is an\r\nextremely unusual occurrence in the United States. Examination of the\r\nblood will determine the presence or absence of both of these\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\n=Complications and Sequels.=--These are very numerous. Among the\r\nformer are diarrhea, delirium, mental and nervous diseases,\r\nbronchitis, pleurisy, pneumonia, ear abscess, perforation of and\r\nhemorrhage from the bowels, inflammation of the gall bladder, disease\r\nof heart, kidney, and bladder, and many rarer conditions, depending\r\nupon the organ which the germ invades. Among sequels are boils,\r\nbaldness, bone disease, painful spine, and, less commonly, insanity\r\nand consumption. While convalescence requires weeks and months, the\r\npatient often gains greatly in flesh and feels made over anew, as in\r\nfact he has been to a great extent, through the destruction and repair\r\nof his organs.\r\n\r\n=Outlook.=--The death rate varies greatly in different epidemics and\r\nunder different conditions. During the Spanish-American War in the\r\nenormous number of cases--over 20,000--the death rate was only about\r\nseven per cent, which represents that in the best hospitals of this\r\ncountry and in private practice. Osler states that the mortality\r\nranges from five to twelve per cent in private practice, and from\r\nseven to twenty per cent in hospital practice, because hospital cases\r\nare usually advanced before admission. The chances of recovery are\r\nmuch greater in patients under fifteen years, and are also more\r\nfavorable between the twenty-second and fortieth years.\r\n\r\n=Treatment.=--There is perhaps no disease in which the services of a\r\nphysician are more desirable or useful than in typhoid fever, on\r\naccount of its prolonged course and the number of complications and\r\nincidents which may occur during its existence. It is the duty of the\r\nphysician to report cases of typhoid to the health authorities, and\r\nthus act as a guardian of the public health. If, however, in any\r\ncircumstances one should have the misfortune to have the care of a\r\ntyphoid patient remote from medical aid, it is a consolation to know\r\nthat the outlook is not greatly altered by medicine or special\r\ntreatment of any sort. There have been epidemics in remote parts of\r\nthis country where numbers of persons have suffered with typhoid\r\nwithout any professional care, and yet with surprisingly good results.\r\nThus, in an epidemic occurring in a small community in Canada,\r\ntwenty-four persons sickened with typhoid and received no medical care\r\nor treatment whatever, and yet there was but one death. The essentials\r\nof treatment are comprised in _Rest, Diet, and Bathing_. Rest to the\r\nextent of absolute quiet in the horizontal position, at the first\r\nsuspicion of typhoid, is requisite in order to avoid the dangers of\r\nbleeding and perforation of the bowels resulting from ulceration of\r\nstructures weakened by the disease. The patient should be assisted to\r\nturn in bed, must make no effort to rise during the sickness, and\r\nshould pass urine and bowel discharges into a bedpan or urinal under\r\ncover. In case of bleeding from the bowels, the bedpan should not be\r\nused, but the discharges may be received for a time in cloths, without\r\nstirring the patient.\r\n\r\n=Diet.=--This should consist chiefly of liquids until a week after\r\nthe fever's complete disappearance. A cup of liquid should be given\r\nevery two hours except during a portion of the sleeping hours. Milk,\r\ndiluted with an equal amount of water, forms the chief food in most\r\ncases unless it disagrees, is refused, or is unobtainable.\r\n\r\nIn addition to milk, albumen water--white of raw egg, strained and\r\ndiluted with an equal amount of water, and flavored with a few drops\r\nof lemon juice or with brandy--is valuable; also juice squeezed from\r\nraw beef--in doses of four tablespoonfuls--coffee, cocoa, and strained\r\nbarley, rice, or oatmeal gruel, broths, unless diarrhea is marked and\r\nincreased by the same. Soft custard, jellies, ice cream,\r\nmilk-and-flour porridge, and eggnog may be used to increase the\r\nvariety. Finely scraped raw or rare beef, very soft toast, and\r\nsoft-boiled or poached eggs are allowable after the first week of\r\nnormal temperature, at the end of the third or fourth week of the\r\ndisease, and during the course of the disease under circumstances\r\nwhere the fluids are not obtainable or not well borne. An abundance of\r\nwater should be supplied to the patient throughout the disease.\r\n\r\n=Bathing.=--The importance of cold, through the medium of water, in\r\ntyphoid fever accomplishes much, both in reducing the temperature and\r\nin stimulating the nervous system and relieving restlessness and\r\ndelirium. Bathing is usually applied when the temperature rises above\r\n102.5 deg. F., and may be repeated every two or three hours if\r\nrestlessness, delirium, and high temperature require it.\r\n\r\nThe immersion of patients in tubs of cold water, as practiced with\r\nbenefit in hospitals, is out of the question for use by inexperienced\r\nlaymen. The patient should have a woven-wire spring bed and soft hair\r\nmattress, over which is laid a folded blanket covered by a rubber\r\nsheet. Sponging the naked body with ice water will suffice in some\r\ncases; in others, when the temperature is over 102-1/2 deg. F., enveloping\r\nthe whole body in a sheet wet in water at 65 deg., and either rubbing the\r\nsurface with ice or cloths wet in ice-cold water, for ten or fifteen\r\nminutes, is advisable. Rubbing of the skin of the chest and sides is\r\nnecessary during the application of cold to prevent shock. The use of\r\na cold cloth on the head and hot-water bottle at the feet, during the\r\nsponging, will also prove beneficial. In children and others objecting\r\nto these cold applications, the vapor bath is effective. For this a\r\npiece of cheese cloth (single thickness) is wet with warm water--100 deg.\r\nto 105 deg.--and is wrapped about the naked body from shoulders to feet,\r\nand is continually wet by sprinkling with water at the temperature of\r\n98 deg.. The evaporation of the water will usually, in fifteen to twenty\r\nminutes, cool the body sufficiently if the patient is fanned\r\ncontinuously by two attendants. In warm weather the patient should\r\nonly be covered with a sheet for a while after the bath, which should\r\nreduce the temperature to 3 deg.. Hot water at the feet, and a little\r\nbrandy or whisky given before the sponging if the pulse be feeble,\r\nwill generally prevent a chill. Patients should be gently dried after\r\nthe bath and covered with dry bedclothing. The utmost care should be\r\ntaken not to agitate a feeble patient during sponging.\r\n\r\nThe long period of lying in bed favors the occurrence of bedsores.\r\nThese are apt to appear about the lower part of the spine, and begin\r\nwith redness of the skin, underneath which a lump may be felt.\r\nConstant cleanliness and bathing with alcohol, diluted with an equal\r\namount of water, will tend to prevent this trouble, while moving the\r\npatient so as to take the pressure off this region and avoiding any\r\nrumpling of the bedding under his body are also serviceable, as well\r\nas the ring air cushion. Medicine is not required, except for special\r\nsymptoms, and has no influence either in lessening the severity of or\r\nin shortening the disease. Brandy or whisky diluted with water are\r\nvaluable in severe cases, with muttering delirium, dry tongue, and\r\nfeeble pulse; it is not usually called for before the end of the\r\nsecond week, and not in mild cases at any time. A tablespoonful of\r\neither, once in two to four hours, is commonly sufficient. Pain and\r\ndistention of the belly are relieved by applying a pad over the whole\r\nfront of the belly--consisting of two layers of flannel wrung out of a\r\nlittle very hot water containing a teaspoonful of turpentine--and\r\ncovered by a dry flannel bandage wrapped about the body. Also the use\r\nof white of egg and water, and beef juice, instead of milk, will\r\nbenefit this condition.\r\n\r\nDiarrhea--if there are more than four discharges daily--may be checked\r\nby one-quarter level teaspoonful doses of bismuth subnitrate, or\r\nteaspoonful doses of paregoric, once in three hours. Constipation is\r\nrelieved by injections of warm soapsuds, once in two days. Bleeding\r\nfrom the bowels must be treated by securing perfect quiet on the\r\npatient's part, and by giving lumps of ice by the mouth, and cutting\r\ndown the nourishment for six hours. Fifteen drops of laudanum should\r\nbe given to adults, if there is restlessness, and some whisky, if the\r\npulse becomes feeble, but it is better to reserve this until the\r\nbleeding has stopped. Patients may be permitted to sit up after a week\r\nof normal temperature, but solid food must not be resumed until two or\r\nthree weeks after departure of fever, and then very gradually,\r\navoiding all coarse and uncooked vegetables and fruit.\r\n\r\nThe greatest care must be exercised by attendants to escape\r\ncontracting the disease and to prevent its communication to others.\r\nThe bowel discharges must be submerged in milk of lime (one part of\r\nslaked lime to four parts of water), and remain in it one hour before\r\nbeing emptied. The urine should be mixed with an equal amount of the\r\nsame, or solution of carbolic acid (one part in twenty parts of hot\r\nwater), and the mixture should stand an hour before being thrown into\r\nprivy or sewer. Clothing and linen in contact with the patient must\r\nbe soaked in the carbolic solution for two hours. The patient's\r\nexpectoration is to be received on old muslin pieces, which must be\r\nburned. The bedpan and eating utensils must be frequently scalded in\r\nboiling water. The attendant should wash his hands always after\r\ntouching the patient, or objects which have come in contact with\r\npatient or his discharges, and thus will avoid contagion. If farm or\r\ndairy workers come in contact with the patient, the latter precaution\r\nis especially important. If there is no water-closet in the house, the\r\ndisinfected discharges may be buried at least 100 feet from any well\r\nor stream. Typhoid fever is only derived from the germs escaping in\r\nthe urine, and in the bowel, nose, or mouth discharges of typhoid\r\npatients.\r\n\r\n\r\n=MUMPS.=--Mumps is a contagious disease characterized by inflammation\r\nof the parotid glands, situated below and in front of the ears, and\r\nsometimes of the other salivary glands below the jaw, and rarely of\r\nthe testicles in males and the breasts in females.\r\n\r\nSwelling and inflammation of the parotid gland also occur from injury;\r\nand as a complication of other diseases, as scarlet fever, typhoid\r\nfever, etc.; but such conditions are wholly distinct from the disease\r\nunder discussion. Mumps is more or less constantly prevalent in most\r\nlarge cities, more often in the spring and fall, and is often\r\nepidemic, attacking ninety per cent of young persons who have not\r\npreviously had the disease. It is more common in males, affecting\r\nchildren and youths, but rarely infants or those past middle age. One\r\nattack usually protects against another.\r\n\r\n=Development.=--A period of from one to three weeks elapses, after\r\nexposure to the disease, before the first signs develop. The germ has\r\nnot yet been discovered, and the means of communication are unknown.\r\nThe breath has been thought to spread the germs of the disease, and\r\nmumps can be conveyed from the sick to the well, by nurses and others\r\nwho themselves escape.\r\n\r\n=Symptoms.=--Sometimes there is some preliminary discomfort before the\r\napparent onset. Thus, in children, restlessness, peevishness, languor,\r\nnausea, loss of appetite, chilliness, fever, and convulsions may usher\r\nin an attack. Mumps begins with pain and swelling below the ear on one\r\nside. Within forty-eight hours a large, firm, sensitive lump forms\r\nunder the ear and extends forward on the face, and downward and\r\nbackward in the neck. The swelling is not generally very painful, but\r\ngives a feeling of tightness and disfigures the patient. It makes\r\nspeaking and swallowing difficult; the patient refuses food, and talks\r\nin a husky voice; chewing causes severe pain. After a period of two to\r\nfour days the other gland usually becomes similarly inflamed, but\r\noccasionally only one gland is attacked. There is always fever from\r\nthe beginning. At first the temperature is about 101 deg. F., rarely much\r\nhigher than 103 deg. or 104 deg.. The fever continues four or five days and\r\nthen gradually declines. The swelling reaches its height in from two\r\nto five days, and then after forty-eight hours slowly subsides, and\r\ndisappears entirely within ten to fourteen days. The patient may\r\ncommunicate the disease for ten days after the fever is past, and\r\nneeds to be isolated for that period. Earache and noises in the ear\r\nfrequently accompany mumps, and rarely abscess of the ear and deafness\r\nresult. The most common complication occurs in males past puberty,\r\nwhen, during recovery or a week or ten days later, one or both\r\ntesticles become painful and swollen, and this continues for as long a\r\ntime as the original mumps. Less often the breasts and sexual organs\r\nof females are similarly affected.\r\n\r\n=Complications and Sequels.=--Recovery without mishap is the usual\r\nresult in mumps, with the exception of involvement of the testicles.\r\nRarely there are high fever, delirium, and great prostration.\r\nSometimes after inflammation of both testicles in the young the organs\r\ncease to develop, and remain so, but sexual vigor is usually retained.\r\nSometimes abscess and gangrene of the inflamed parotid gland occur.\r\nRecurring swelling and inflammation of the gland may occur, and\r\npermanent swelling and hardness remain. Meningitis, nervous and joint\r\ncomplications are among the rarer sequels.\r\n\r\n=Treatment.=--The patient should remain in bed while the fever lasts.\r\nA liquid diet is advisable during this time. Fever may be allayed by\r\nfrequent sponging of the naked body with tepid water. High fever and\r\ndelirium demand the constant use, on the head, of the ice cap (a\r\nrubber bag, made to fit the head, containing ice). The relief of pain\r\nin the swollen gland is secured by the frequent application of a thick\r\nlayer of sheet cotton, large enough to cover the whole side of the\r\nneck, wrung out of hot water and covered with oil-silk or rubber\r\nsheeting, with a bandage to retain it in place.\r\n\r\nParegoric may be given for the same purpose--a tablespoonful for\r\nadults; a teaspoonful for a child of eight to ten, well diluted with\r\nwater, and not repeated inside of two hours, and not then unless the\r\npain continues unabated. Inflammation of the testicles demands rest in\r\nbed, elevation of the testicle on a pillow after wrapping it in a\r\nthick layer of absorbent cotton, or applying hot compresses, as\r\nrecommended for the neck. After the first few days of this treatment,\r\nadjust a suspensory bandage, which can be procured at any apothecary\r\nshop, and apply daily the following ointment: guiacol, sixty grains;\r\nlard, one-half ounce, over the swollen testicle.\r\n\r\n\r\n=WHOOPING COUGH.=--A contagious disease characterized by fits of\r\ncoughing, during which a whooping or crowing sound is made following a\r\nlong-drawn breath. Whooping cough is generally taken through direct\r\ncontact with the sick, rarely through exposure to the sick room, or to\r\npersons or clothing used by the sick. The germ which causes the\r\ndisease is probably in the mucus of the nose and throat. Whooping\r\ncough is usually more or less prevalent in all thickly settled\r\ncivilized communities, at times is epidemic, and often follows\r\nepidemics of measles. It occurs chiefly in children from six months to\r\nsix years of age. Girls and all weak and delicate subjects are\r\nslightly more susceptible to the disease. Some children are naturally\r\nimmune to whooping cough. One attack usually protects against another.\r\n\r\n=Development.=--A variable period elapses between the time of exposure\r\nto whooping cough and the appearance of the first symptoms. This may\r\nbe from two days to two weeks; usually seven to ten days.\r\n\r\n=Symptoms.=--Whooping cough begins like an ordinary cold in the head,\r\nwith cough, worse at night, which persists. The coughing fits increase\r\nand the child gets red in the face, has difficulty in getting its\r\nbreath during them, and sometimes vomits when the attack is over.\r\nAfter a variable period, from a few days to two weeks from the\r\nbeginning of the cough, the peculiar feature of the disease appears.\r\nThe child gives fifteen or twenty short coughs without drawing breath,\r\nthe face swells and grows blue, the eyeballs protrude, the veins stand\r\nout, and the patient appears to be suffocating, when at last he draws\r\nin a long breath with a crowing or whooping sound, which gives rise to\r\nthe name of the disease. Several such fits of coughing may follow one\r\nanother and are often succeeded by vomiting and the expulsion of a\r\nlarge amount of phlegm or mucus, which is sometimes streaked with\r\nblood. In mild cases there may be six to twelve attacks in twenty-four\r\nhours; in severe cases from forty to eighty. The attacks last from a\r\nfew seconds to one or two minutes. Occasionally the whoop comes before\r\nthe coughing fit, and sometimes there may be no whooping at all, only\r\nfits of coughing with vomiting. Between the attacks, puffiness of the\r\nface and eyes and blueness of the tongue persist. The coughing fits\r\nand whooping last usually from three to six weeks, but the duration of\r\nthe disease is very variable. Occasionally it lasts many months,\r\nespecially when it occurs in winter. The contagiousness of whooping\r\ncough continues about two months, or ceases before that time with the\r\ncessation of the cough. Oftentimes there may be occasional whooping\r\nfor months; or, after ceasing altogether for some days, it may begin\r\nagain. In neither of these conditions is the disease considered still\r\ncontagious after two months. When an attack of whooping is coming on,\r\nthe child often seems to have some warning, as he seems terrified and\r\nsuddenly sits up in bed, or, if playing, grasps hold of something, or\r\nruns to his mother or nurse. Coughing fits are favored by emotion or\r\nexcitement, by crying, singing, eating, drinking, sudden change of\r\ntemperature, and by bad air.\r\n\r\n=Complications and Sequels.=--These are many and make whooping cough a\r\ncritical disease for very young children. Bronchitis and pneumonia\r\noften complicate whooping cough in winter, and diarrhea frequently\r\noccurs with it in summer. Convulsions not infrequently follow the\r\ncoughing fits in infants, and, owing to the amount of blood forced to\r\nthe head during the attacks, nosebleed and dark spots on the forehead\r\nand surface of the eyes appear from breaking of small blood vessels in\r\nthese places. Severe vomiting and diarrhea occasionally aggravate the\r\ncase, and pleurisy and consumption may occur. The violent coughing may\r\npermanently damage the heart. Rupture of the lung tissue happens from\r\nthe same cause, and paralysis sometimes follows breaking of a blood\r\nvessel in the brain. But in the vast majority of cases in children\r\nover two years old no dangerous sequel need be feared.\r\n\r\n=Outlook.=--Owing to the numerous complications, whooping cough must\r\nbe looked upon as a very serious disease, especially in infants under\r\ntwo years, and in weak, delicate children. It causes one-fourth of all\r\ndeaths among children, the death rate varying from three to fifteen\r\nper cent in different times and under different circumstances. For\r\nthis reason a physician's services should always be secured when\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n=Treatment.=--A host of remedies is used for whooping cough, but no\r\nsingle one is always the best. It is often necessary to try different\r\nmedicines till we find one which excels. Fresh air is of greatest\r\nimportance. Patients should be strictly isolated in rooms by\r\nthemselves, and it is wise to send away children who have not been\r\nexposed. Morally, parents are criminally negligent who allow their\r\nchildren with whooping cough to associate with healthy children. If\r\nthe coughing fits are severe or there is fever, children should be\r\nkept in bed. Usually there is not much fever; perhaps an elevation of\r\na degree or two at first, and at times during the disease. Otherwise,\r\nchildren may be outdoors in warm weather, and in winter on warm, quiet\r\ndays. Sea air is especially good for them. It is best that the sick\r\nshould have two rooms, going from one to the other, so that the\r\nwindows in the room last occupied may be opened and well ventilated.\r\nFresh air at night is especially needful, and the patient should sleep\r\nin a room which has been freshly aired. The temperature should be kept\r\nat an even 70 deg. F., and the child should not be exposed to draughts.\r\nVaporizing antiseptics in the sick room has proved beneficial. A two\r\nper cent solution of carbolic acid in water is useful for this\r\npurpose, or a substance called vapo-cresoline, with which is sold a\r\nvaporizing lamp and directions for use. A one per cent solution of\r\nresorcin, or of hydrogen dioxide, diluted with four parts of water,\r\nused in an atomizer for spraying the throat, every two hours, has\r\ngiven good results. In the beginning of the disease, before the\r\nwhooping has begun, a mixture of paregoric and syrup of ipecac will\r\nrelieve the cough, ten drops of the former with five of the latter,\r\nfor a child of two years, given together in water every three hours.\r\nThe bromide of sodium, five grains in water, every three hours during\r\nthe day, for a child of two, is serviceable in relieving the fits of\r\ncoughing in the day; while at night, two grains of chloral, not\r\nrepeated, may be given in water at bedtime to secure sleep, in a child\r\nof two. The tincture of belladonna, in doses of two drops in water,\r\nthree times daily, for a child of two, is also often efficacious.\r\nQuinine, given in the dose of one-sixth grain for each month of the\r\nchild's age under a year; or in one and one-half grain doses for each\r\nyear of age under five, is one of the older and more valuable\r\nremedies. It should be given three times daily in pill with jelly, or\r\nsolution in water. Bromoform in doses of two drops for a child of two,\r\nand increasing to five drops for a child of six, may be given in syrup\r\nthree times daily with benefit. Most of these drugs should be employed\r\nonly with a doctor's advice, when this is possible. To sum up, use the\r\nvapo-cresoline every day. When no physician is available, begin with\r\nbelladonna during the day, using bromide of sodium at night. If this\r\nfails to modify the whooping after five days' trial, use bromide and\r\nchloral. In severe cases use bromoform. During a fit of coughing and\r\nwhooping, it is well to support the child's head, and if he ceases to\r\nbreathe, he should be slapped over the face and chest with a towel wet\r\nwith cold water. Interference with sleep caused by coughing, and loss\r\nof proper nourishment through vomiting, lead to wasting and debility.\r\nTeaspoonful doses of emulsion of cod-liver oil three times daily,\r\nafter eating, are often useful in convalescence, and great care must\r\nbe taken at this time to prevent exposure and pneumonia. Change of air\r\nand place will frequently hasten recovery remarkably in the later\r\nstages of the disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n=ERYSIPELAS.=--Erysipelas is a disease caused by germs which gain\r\nentrance through some wound or abrasion in the skin or mucous\r\nmembranes. Even where no wound is evident it may be taken for granted\r\nthat there has been some slight abrasion of the surface, although\r\ninvisible. Erysipelas cannot be communicated any distance through the\r\nair, but it is contagious in that the germs which cause it may be\r\ncarried from the sick to the well by nurses, furniture, bedding,\r\ndressings, clothing, and other objects. Thus, patients with wounds,\r\nwomen in childbirth, and the newborn may become affected, but modern\r\nmethods of surgical cleanliness have largely eliminated these forms of\r\nerysipelas, especially in hospitals, where it used to be common.\r\nErysipelas attacks people of all ages, some persons being very\r\nsusceptible and suffering frequent recurrences. The form which arises\r\nwithout any visible wound is seen usually on the face, and occurs most\r\nfrequently in the spring. The period of development, from the time the\r\ngerms enter the body until the appearance of the disease, lasts from\r\nthree to seven days.\r\n\r\nErysipelas begins with usually a severe chill (or convulsion in a\r\nbaby) and fever. Vomiting, headache, and general lassitude are often\r\npresent. A patch of red appears on the cheeks, bridge of nose, or\r\nabout the eye or nostril, and spreads over the face. The margins of\r\nthe eruption are sharply defined. Within twenty-four hours the disease\r\nis fully developed; the skin is tense, smooth, and shiny, scarlet and\r\nswollen, and feels hot, and is often covered with small blisters. The\r\npain is more or less intense, burning or itching occurs, and there is\r\na sensation of great tightness or tension. On the face the swelling\r\ncloses the eye and may interfere with breathing through the nose. The\r\nlips, ears, and scalp are swollen, and the person may become\r\nunrecognizable in a couple of days. Erysipelas tends to spread like a\r\ndrop of oil, and the borders of the inflammatory patch are well\r\nmarked. It rarely spreads from the face to the chest and body, and but\r\noccasionally attacks the throat. During the height of the inflammation\r\nthe temperature reaches 104 deg. F, or over. After four or five days, in\r\nmost cases, erysipelas begins to subside, together with the pain and\r\ntemperature, and recovery occurs with some scaling of the skin. The\r\ndeath rate is said to average about ten per cent in hospitals, four\r\nper cent in private practice. Headache, delirium, and stupor are\r\ncommon when erysipelas attacks the scalp. The appearance of the\r\ndisease in other locations is similar to that described. Relapses are\r\nnot uncommon, but are not so severe as the original attack. Spreading\r\nmay extend over a large area, and the deeper parts may become\r\naffected, with the formation of deep abscesses and great destruction\r\nof tissue. Certain internal organs, heart, lungs, spleen, and kidneys,\r\nare occasionally involved with serious consequences. The old, the\r\ndiseased, and the alcoholic are more apt to succumb, also the newborn.\r\nIt is a curious fact that cure of malignant growths (sarcoma), chronic\r\nskin diseases, and old ulcers sometimes follows attacks of erysipelas.\r\n\r\n=Treatment.=--The duration of erysipelas is usually from a few days to\r\nabout two weeks, according to its extent. It tends to run a definite\r\ncourse and to recovery in most cases without treatment. The patient\r\nmust be isolated in a room with good ventilation and sunlight.\r\nDressings and objects coming in contact with him must be burned or\r\nboiled. The diet should be liquid, such as milk, beef tea, soups, and\r\ngruels. The use of cloths wet constantly with cold water, or with a\r\ncold solution of one-half teaspoonful of pure carbolic acid to the\r\npint of hot water, or with a poisonous solution of sugar of lead, four\r\ngrains to the pint, should be kept over small inflamed areas. Fever is\r\nreduced by sponging the whole naked body with cold water at frequent\r\nintervals. A tablespoonful of whisky or brandy in water may be given\r\nevery two hours to adults if the pulse is weak. Painting the borders\r\nof the inflamed patch with contractile collodion may prevent its\r\nspreading. The patient must be quarantined until all scaling ceases,\r\nusually for two weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n=Malaria and Yellow Fever=\r\n\r\n_The Malarial Parasite--Mosquitoes the Means of Infection--Different\r\nForms of Malaria--Symptoms and Treatment--No Specific for Yellow\r\nFever._\r\n\r\n\r\n=MALARIA; CHILLS AND FEVER; AGUE; FEVER AND AGUE; SWAMP OR MARSH\r\nFEVER; INTERMITTENT OR REMITTENT FEVER; BILIOUS FEVER.=--Malaria is a\r\ncommunicable disease characterized by attacks of fever occurring at\r\ncertain intervals, and due to a minute animal parasite which inhabits\r\nthe body of the mosquito, and is communicated to the blood of man by\r\nthe bites of this insect.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with this definition malaria is not a contagious disease\r\nin the sense that it is acquired by contact with the sick, which is\r\nnot the case, but it is derived from contact with certain kinds of\r\nmosquitoes, and can be contracted in no other way, despite the many\r\npopular notions to the contrary. Mosquitoes, in their turn, acquire\r\nthe malarial parasite by biting human beings suffering from malaria.\r\nIt thus becomes possible for one malarial patient, coming to a region\r\nhitherto free from the disease, to infect the whole district with\r\nmalaria through the medium of mosquitoes.\r\n\r\n=Causes.=--While the parasite infesting mosquitoes is the only direct\r\ncause of malaria, yet certain circumstances are requisite for the life\r\nand growth of the mosquitoes. These are moisture and proper\r\ntemperature, which should average not less than 60 deg. F. Damp soil,\r\nmarshes, or bodies of water have always been recognized as favoring\r\nmalaria.\r\n\r\nMalaria is common in temperate climates--in the summer and autumn\r\nmonths particularly, less often in spring, and very rarely in winter,\r\nwhile it is prevalent in the tropics and subtropics all the year\r\nround, but more commonly in the spring and fall of these regions. The\r\nolder ideas, that malaria was caused by something arising in vapors\r\nfrom wet grounds or water, or by contamination of the drinking water,\r\nor by night air, or was due to sleeping outdoors or on the ground\r\nfloors of dwellings, are only true in so far as these favor the growth\r\nof the peculiar kind of mosquitoes infected by the malarial parasites.\r\nTwo essentials are requisite for the existence of malaria in a region:\r\nthe presence of the particular mosquito, and the actual infection of\r\nthe mosquito with the malarial parasite. The kind of mosquito acting\r\nas host to the malarial parasite is the genus _Anopheles_, of which\r\nthere are several species. The more common house mosquito of the\r\nUnited States is the _Culex_. The _Anopheles_ can usually be\r\ndistinguished from the latter by its mottled wings, and, when on a\r\nwall or ceiling, it sits with the body protruding at an angle of 45 deg.\r\nfrom the surface, with its hind legs hanging down or drawn against the\r\nwall. In the case of the _Culex_, the body is held parallel with the\r\nwall, the wings are usually not mottled, and the hind legs are carried\r\nup over the back.\r\n\r\nWhen a mosquito infected with the malarial parasite bites man, the\r\nparasite enters his blood along with the saliva that anoints the\r\nlancet of the mosquito. The parasite is one of the simplest forms of\r\nanimal life, consisting of a microscopical mass of living, motile\r\nmatter which enters the red-blood cell of man, and there grows,\r\nundergoes changes, and, after a variable time, multiplies by dividing\r\ninto a number of still smaller bodies which represent a new generation\r\nof young parasites. This completes the whole period of their\r\nexistence. It is at that stage in the development of the parasite in\r\nthe human body when it multiplies by dividing that the chills and\r\nfever in malaria appear. What causes the malarial attack at this point\r\nis unknown, unless it be that the parasites give rise to a poison at\r\nthe time of their division. Between the attacks of chills and fever in\r\nmalaria there is usually an interval of freedom of a few hours, which\r\ncorresponds to the period intervening in the life of the parasite in\r\nthe human body, between the birth of the young parasites and their\r\ngrowth and final division, in turn, into new individuals. This\r\ninterval varies with the kind of parasite. The common form of malaria\r\nis caused by a parasite requiring forty-eight hours for its\r\ndevelopment. The malarial attacks caused by this parasite then occur\r\nevery other day, when the parasite undergoes reproduction by division.\r\nHowever, an attack may occur every day when there are two separate\r\ngroups of these parasites in the blood, the time of birth of one set\r\nof parasites, with an accompanying malarial attack, happening one day;\r\nthat of the other group coming on the next, so that between the two\r\nthere is a daily birth of parasites and a daily attack of malaria. In\r\ncases of malaria caused by one group of parasites the attacks appear\r\nat about the same time of day, but when the attacks are caused by\r\ndifferent groups of parasites the times of attack may vary on\r\ndifferent days. In the worst types of malaria the parasites do not all\r\ngo through the same stages of development at the same time, as is\r\ncommonly the case in the milder forms prevalent in temperate regions,\r\nso that the fever--corresponding to the stage of reproduction of the\r\nparasites--occurs at irregular intervals.\r\n\r\nIn a not uncommon type of malaria the attacks occur every third day,\r\nwith two days of intermission or freedom from fever. Different groups\r\nof parasites causing this form of malaria, and having different times\r\nof reproduction, may inhabit the same patient and give rise to\r\nvariation in the times of attack. Thus, an attack may occur on two\r\nsuccessive days with a day of intermission.\r\n\r\nThe reproduction of the parasite in the human blood is not a sexual\r\nreproduction; that takes place in the body of the mosquito.\r\n\r\nWhen a healthy mosquito bites a malarial patient, the parasite enters\r\nthe body of the mosquito with the blood of the patient bitten. It\r\nenters its stomach, where certain differing forms of the parasite,\r\ntaking the part of male and female individuals, unite and form a new\r\nparasite, which, entering the stomach wall of the mosquito, gives\r\nbirth in the course of a week to innumerable small bodies as their\r\nprogeny. These find their way into the salivary glands which secrete\r\nthe poison of the mosquito bite, and escape, when the mosquito bites a\r\nhuman being, into the blood of the latter and give him malaria.\r\n\r\n=Distribution.=--Malaria is very widely distributed, and is much more\r\nsevere in tropical countries and the warmer parts of temperate\r\nregions. In the United States malaria is prevalent in some parts of\r\nNew England, as in the Connecticut Valley, and in the course of the\r\nCharles River, in the country near Boston. It is common in the\r\nvicinity of the cities of Philadelphia, New York, and Baltimore, but\r\nhere is less frequent than formerly, and is of a comparatively mild\r\ntype. More severe forms prevail along the Gulf of Mexico and the\r\nshores of the Mississippi and its branches, especially in Mississippi,\r\nTexas, Louisiana, and Arkansas, but even here it is less fatal and\r\nwidespread than formerly. In Alaska, the Northwest, and on the Pacific\r\nCoast of the United States malaria is almost unknown, while it is but\r\nslightly prevalent in the region of the Great Lakes, as about Lakes\r\nErie and St. Clair.\r\n\r\n=Development.=--Usually a week or two elapses after the entrance of\r\nthe malarial parasite into the blood before symptoms occur; rarely\r\nthis period is as short as twenty-four hours, and occasionally may\r\nextend to several months. It often happens that the parasite remains\r\nquiescent in the system without being completely exterminated after\r\nrecovery from an attack, only to grow and occasion a fresh attack, a\r\nmonth or two after the first, unless treatment has been thoroughly\r\nprosecuted for a sufficient time.\r\n\r\n=Symptoms.=--Certain symptoms give warning of an attack, as headache,\r\nlassitude, yawning, restlessness, discomfort in the region of the\r\nstomach, and nausea or vomiting. The attack begins with a chilliness\r\nor creeping feeling, and there may be so severe a chill that the\r\npatient is violently shaken from head to foot and the teeth chatter.\r\nChills are not generally seen in children under six, but an attack\r\nbegins with uneasiness, the face is pinched, the eyes sunken, the lips\r\nand tips of the fingers and toes are blue, and there is dullness and\r\noften nausea and vomiting. Then, instead of a chill, the eyelids and\r\nlimbs begin to twitch, and the child goes into a convulsion. While the\r\nsurface of the skin is cold and blue during a chill, yet the\r\ntemperature, taken with the thermometer in the mouth or bowel, reaches\r\n102 deg., 105 deg., or 106 deg. F., often. The chill lasts from a few minutes to\r\nan hour, and as it passes away the face becomes flushed and the skin\r\nhot. There is often a throbbing headache, thirst, and sometimes mild\r\ndelirium. The temperature at this time, when the patient feels\r\nintensely feverish, is very little higher than during the chill. The\r\nfever lasts during three or four hours, in most cases, and gradually\r\ndeclines, as well as the headache and general distressing symptoms\r\nwith the onset of sweating, to disappear in an hour or two, when the\r\npatient often sinks into a refreshing sleep. Such attacks more\r\ncommonly occur every day, every other day, or after intermissions of\r\ntwo days. Rarely do attacks come on with intervals of four, five, six,\r\nor more days. The attacks are apt to recur at the same time of day as\r\nin the first attack. In severe cases the intervals may grow shorter,\r\nin mild cases, longer. In the interval between the attacks the patient\r\nusually feels well unless the disease is of exceptional severity.\r\nThere is also entire freedom from fever in the intervals except in the\r\ngrave types common to hot climates. Frequently the chill is absent,\r\nand after a preliminary stage of dullness there is fever followed by\r\nsweating. This variety is known as \"dumb ague.\"\r\n\r\n=Irregular and Severe Form--Chronic Malaria.=--This occurs in those\r\nwho have lived long in malarial regions and have suffered repeated\r\nattacks of fever, or in those who have not received proper treatment.\r\nIt is characterized by a generally enfeebled state, the patient having\r\na sallow complexion, cold hands and feet, and temperature below\r\nnormal, except occasionally, when there may be slight fever. When the\r\ncondition is marked, there are breathlessness on slight exertion,\r\nswelling of the feet and ankles, and \"ague cake,\" that is, enlargement\r\nof the spleen, shown by a lump felt in the abdomen extending downward\r\nfrom beneath the ribs on the left side.\r\n\r\nAmong unusual forms of malaria are: periodic attacks of drowsiness\r\nwithout chills, but accompanied by slight fever (100 deg. to 101 deg. F.);\r\nperiodic attacks of neuralgia, as of the face, chest, or in the form\r\nof sciatica; periodic \"sick headaches.\" These may take the place of\r\nordinary malarial attacks in malarial regions, and are cured by\r\nordinary malarial treatment.\r\n\r\n=Remittent Form (unfortunately termed \"bilious\").=--This severe type\r\nof malaria occurs sometimes in late summer and autumn, in temperate\r\nclimates, but is seen much more commonly in the Southern United States\r\nand in the tropics. It begins often with lassitude, headache, loss of\r\nappetite and pains in the limbs and back, a bad taste, and nausea for\r\na day or two, followed by a chill, and fever ranging from 101 deg. to 103 deg.\r\nF., or more. The chill is not usually repeated, but the fever is\r\ncontinuous, often suggesting typhoid fever. With the fever, there are\r\nflushed face, occasional delirium, and vomiting of bile, but more\r\noften a drowsy state. After twelve to forty-eight hours the fever\r\nabates, but the temperature does not usually fall below 100 deg. F., and\r\nthe patient feels better, but not entirely well, as in the ordinary\r\nform of malaria, where the fever disappears entirely between the\r\nattacks. After an interval varying from three to thirty-six hours the\r\ntemperature rises again and the more severe symptoms reappear, and so\r\nthe disease continues, there never being complete freedom from fever,\r\nthe temperature sometimes rising as high as 105 deg. or 106 deg. F. In some\r\ncases there are nosebleed, cracked tongue, and brownish deposit on the\r\nteeth, and a delirious or stupid state, as in typhoid fever, but the\r\ndistention of the belly, diarrhea, and rose spots are absent. The skin\r\nand whites of the eyes often take on the yellowish hue of jaundice.\r\nThis fever has been called typhomalarial fever, under the supposition\r\nthat it was a hybrid of the two. This is not the case, although it is\r\npossible that the two diseases may occur in the same individual at the\r\nsame time. This, indeed, frequently happened as stated, in our\r\nsoldiers coming from the West Indies during the Spanish-American\r\nWar--but is an extremely uncommon event in the United States.\r\n\r\n=Pernicious Malaria.=--This is a very grave form of the disease. It\r\nrarely is seen in temperate regions, but often occurs in the tropics\r\nand subtropics. It may follow an ordinary attack of chills and fever,\r\nor come on very suddenly. After a chill the hot stage appears, and the\r\npatient falls into a deep stupor or unconscious state, with flushed\r\nface, noisy breathing, and high fever (104 deg. to 105 deg. F.). Wild delirium\r\nor convulsions afflict the patient in some cases. The attack may last\r\nfor six to twenty-four hours, from which the patient may recover, only\r\nto suffer another like seizure, or he may die in the first. In another\r\nform of this pernicious malaria the symptoms resemble true cholera,\r\nand is peculiar to the tropics. In this there are violent vomiting,\r\nwatery diarrhea, cramps in the legs, cold hands and feet, and\r\ncollapse. Sometimes the attack begins with a chill, but fever, if any,\r\nis slight, although the patient complains of great thirst and inward\r\nheat. The pulse is feeble and the breathing shallow, but the intellect\r\nremains clear.\r\n\r\nDeath often occurs in this, as in the former type of pernicious\r\nmalaria, yet vigorous treatment with quinine, iron, and nitre will\r\nfrequently prove curative in either form.\r\n\r\n=Black Water Fever.=--Rarely in temperate climates, but frequently in\r\nthe Southern United States and in the tropics, especially Africa;\r\nafter a few days of fever, or after chilliness and slight fever, the\r\nurine becomes very dark, owing to blood escaping in it. This sometimes\r\nappears only periodically, and is often relieved by quinine. It is\r\napparently a malarial fever with an added infection from another\r\ncause.\r\n\r\n=Chagres Fever.=--A severe form of malarial fever acquired on the\r\nIsthmus of Panama, apparently a hemorrhagic form of the pernicious\r\nvariety, and so treated.\r\n\r\n=Detection.=--To the well-educated physician is now open an exact\r\nmethod of determining the existence of malaria, and of distinguishing\r\nit from all similar diseases, by the examination of the patient's\r\nblood for the malarial parasite--its presence or absence deciding the\r\npresence or absence of the disease. For the layman the following\r\npoints are offered: intermittency of chills and fever, or of fever\r\nalone, should suggest malaria, particularly in a patient living in or\r\ncoming from a malarial region, or in a previous sufferer from the\r\ndisease. In such a case treatment with quinine will solve the doubt in\r\nmost cases, and will do no harm even if the disease be not malaria.\r\nMalaria is one of the few diseases which can be cured with certainty\r\nby a drug; failure to stop the symptoms by proper amounts of quinine\r\nmeans, in the vast majority of cases, that they are not due to\r\nmalaria. There are many other diseases in which chills, fever, and\r\nsweating occur at intervals, as in poisoning from the presence of\r\nsuppuration or formation of pus anywhere in the body, but the layman's\r\nignorance will not permit him to recognize these in many instances.\r\nThe quinine test is the best for him.\r\n\r\n=Prevention.=--Since the French surgeon, Laveran, discovered the\r\nparasite of malaria in 1880, and Manson, in 1896, emphasized the fact\r\nthat the mosquito is the medium of its communication to man, the way\r\nfor the extermination of the disease has been plain. \"Mosquito\r\nengineering\" has attained a recognized place. This consists in\r\ndestroying the abodes of mosquitoes (marshes, ponds, and pools) by\r\ndrainage and filling, also in the application of petroleum on their\r\nsurface to destroy the immature mosquitoes. Such work has already led\r\nto wonderful results.[11] Open water barrels and water tanks prove a\r\nfruitful breeding place for these insects, and should be abolished.\r\nThe protection of the person from mosquito bites is obtained by proper\r\nscreening of habitations and the avoidance of unscreened open air, at\r\nor after nightfall, when the pests are most in evidence. Dwellings on\r\nhigh grounds are less liable to mosquitoes. Persons entering a\r\nmalarial region should take from two to three grains of quinine three\r\ntimes a day to kill any malarial parasites which may invade their\r\nblood, and should screen doors and windows. Patients after recovery\r\nfrom malaria must prolong the treatment as advised, and renew it each\r\nspring and fall for several years thereafter. A malarial patient is a\r\ndirect menace to his entire neighborhood, if mosquitoes enter.\r\n\r\n=Treatment.=--The treatment of malaria practically means the use of\r\nquinine given in the proper way and in the proper form and dose.\r\nDespite popular prejudices against it, quinine is capable of little\r\nharm, unless used in large doses for months, and no other remedy has\r\nyet succeeded in rivaling it in any way. Quinine is frequently useless\r\nfrom adulteration; this may be avoided by getting it of a reliable\r\ndrug house and paying a fair price for the best to be had. Neither\r\npills nor tablets of quinine are suitable, as they sometimes pass\r\nthrough the bowels undissolved. The drug should be taken dissolved in\r\nwater, or, more pleasantly, in starch wafers or gelatin capsules. When\r\nthe drug is vomited it may be given (in double the dose) dissolved in\r\nhalf a pint of water, as an injection into the bowels, three times\r\ndaily. Infants of a few months may be treated by rubbing an ointment\r\n(containing thirty grains of quinine sulphate mixed with an ounce and\r\na half of lard) well into the skin of the armpits and groins, night\r\nand morning. Children under the age of two can be best treated by\r\nquinine made into suppositories--little conical bodies of cocoa butter\r\ncontaining two grains each--one being introduced into the bowel, night\r\nand morning.\r\n\r\nDuring an attack of malaria the discomfort of the chill and fever may\r\nbe relieved to considerable extent by thirty grains of sodium bromide\r\n(adult dose) in water. Hot drinks and hot-water bottles with warm\r\ncovering may be used during the chill, while cold sponging of the\r\nwhole naked body will afford comfort during the hot stage. In the\r\npernicious form, attended with unconsciousness, sponging with very\r\ncold water, or the use of the cold bath with vigorous friction of the\r\nwhole body and cold to the head are valuable. The effect of quinine is\r\ngreatest during the time of birth of a new generation of young\r\nparasites in the blood, which corresponds with the time of the\r\nmalarial attack. But in order that the quinine shall have time to\r\npermeate the blood, it must be given two to four hours before the\r\nexpected chill, and then will probably prevent the next attack but\r\none. A dose of ten grains of quinine sulphate taken three times daily\r\nfor the first three days of treatment; then a dose of three grains,\r\nthree times daily for two weeks; and finally two grains, three times\r\ndaily for the rest of the month of treatment will, in many cases,\r\ncomplete a cure. If the quinine cause much ringing in the ears and\r\ndeafness, it will be found that sodium bromide taken with the quinine\r\n(in twice the dose) dissolved in water, will correct this trouble. If\r\nthe patient is constipated and the bowel discharges are light colored,\r\na few one-quarter grain doses of calomel may be taken every two hours,\r\nand followed in twelve hours by a dose of Epsom salts, on the first\r\nday of treatment, with quinine. It is no use to take quinine by the\r\nmouth later than two hours before an attack, and if the patient cannot\r\nsecure treatment before this time, he should take a single dose of\r\ntwenty grains of quinine.\r\n\r\nTo children may be given a daily amount of quinine equal to one grain\r\nfor each year of their age. In the severe forms of remittent and\r\npernicious types of malaria it may be necessary for the patient to\r\ntake as much as thirty grains of quinine every three days or so to cut\r\nshort the attack. But, unfortunately, the digestion may be so poor\r\nthat absorption of the drug does not occur, and in such an event the\r\nuse of quinine in the form of the bisulphate in thirty-grain doses,\r\nwith five grains of tartaric acid, will in some cases prove effective.\r\nChronic malaria is best treated with small doses of quinine, together\r\nwith arsenic and iron. A capsule containing two grains of quinine\r\nsulphate, one-thirtieth grain of arsenious acid, and two grains of\r\nreduced iron should be taken three times daily for several weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n=YELLOW FEVER.=--This is a disease of tropical and subtropical\r\ncountries characterized by fever, jaundice, and vomiting (in severe\r\ncases vomiting of blood), caused by a special germ or parasite which\r\nis communicated to man solely through the agency of the bites of a\r\nspecial mosquito, _Stegomyia fasciata_.\r\n\r\n=Distribution.=--Yellow fever has always been present in Havana, Rio,\r\nVera Cruz, and other Spanish-American seaports; also on the west coast\r\nof Africa. It is frequently epidemic in the tropical ports of the\r\nAtlantic in America and Africa, and there have been numerous epidemics\r\nin the southern and occasional ones in the northern seacoast cities of\r\nthe United States. The last epidemic occurred in the South in 1899.\r\nRarely has the disease been introduced into Europe, and it has never\r\nspread there except in Spanish ports. The disease is one requiring\r\nwarm weather, for a temperature under 75 deg. F. is unsuitable to the\r\ngrowth of the special mosquito harboring the yellow-fever parasite. It\r\nspreads in the crowded and unsanitary parts of seacoast cities, to\r\nwhich it is brought on vessels by contaminated mosquitoes or\r\nyellow-fever patients from the tropics. Havana has heretofore been the\r\nsource of infection for the United States, but since the disease has\r\nbeen eradicated by the American army of occupation, that danger has\r\nbeen removed. Yellow fever is not at all contagious in the sense that\r\na healthy person can contract the disease by contact with a\r\nyellow-fever patient, or with his discharges from the stomach, bowels,\r\nor elsewhere, and is probably only communicated to man by the bite of\r\na particular kind of mosquito harboring the yellow-fever organism in\r\nits body. Both these facts have been incontestably proved,[12] in part\r\nby brave volunteers from the United States Army who submitted to sleep\r\nfor twenty-one days on clothes soiled with discharges from patients\r\ndying of yellow fever, and escaped the disease; and by others living\r\nin uncontaminated surroundings who permitted themselves to be bitten\r\nby infected mosquitoes and promptly developed yellow fever.\r\n\r\n=Development.=--After a person has been bitten by an infected\r\nmosquito, from fourteen hours to five days and seventeen hours elapse\r\nbefore the development of the first symptoms--usually this period\r\nlasts from three to four days. With the appearance of a single case in\r\na region, a period of two weeks must elapse before the development of\r\nanother case arising from the first one. This follows because a\r\nmosquito, after biting a patient, cannot communicate the germ to\r\nanother person for twelve days, and two days more must elapse before\r\nthe disease appears in the latter.\r\n\r\n=Symptoms.=--During the night or morning the patient has a chill (or\r\nfeels chilly) and experiences discomfort in the stomach, with\r\nsometimes nausea and vomiting. There is pain through the forehead and\r\neyes, in the back and thighs, and often in the calves. The face is\r\nflushed and slightly swollen--particularly the upper lip--and the eyes\r\nare bloodshot, and gradually, in the course of thirty-six hours, the\r\nwhites become yellowish. This is one of the most distinguishing\r\nfeatures of the fever, but is often absent in children. The tongue is\r\ncoated, there are loss of appetite, lassitude, sore throat, and\r\nconstipation. In the beginning the temperature ranges from 101 deg. to\r\n103 deg. F., or in severe cases as high as 105 deg. or 106 deg. F., and the pulse\r\nfrom 110 to 120 beats a minute. The fever continues for several\r\ndays--except in mild cases--but the pulse usually falls before the\r\ntemperature does. For example, the temperature may rise a degree\r\nduring the third day to 103 deg. F., while the pulse falls ten or more\r\nbeats at the same time and may not be over 70 or 80, while the\r\ntemperature is still elevated. This is another peculiar feature of the\r\ndisease. Vomiting often increases on the second or third day, and the\r\ndreaded \"black vomit\" may then occur. This presents the appearance of\r\ncoffee grounds or tarry matter and, while a dangerous symptom, does\r\nnot by any means presage a fatal ending. The black color is due to\r\naltered blood from the stomach, and bleeding sometimes takes place\r\nfrom the nose, throat, gums, and bowels, with black discharges from\r\nthe latter. The action of the kidneys is usually interfered with,\r\ncausing diminution in the amount of urine. It is extremely important\r\nto pay regard to this feature, because failure of the patient to pass\r\na proper amount of urine calls for prompt action to avert fatal\r\npoisoning from retained waste matters in the blood. The normal amount\r\nof urine passed in twenty-four hours in health is over three pints,\r\nand while not more than two-thirds of this amount could be expected to\r\nbe passed by a fever patient, yet in yellow fever the passage of urine\r\nmay be almost or wholly suppressed. The course of the disease varies\r\ngreatly. In children--especially of the Creoles--it is frequently so\r\nmild as to pass unnoticed. In adults the fever may only last a few\r\nhours, or two or three days, with gradual recovery from the various\r\nsymptoms, and yellowness of the skin lasting for some time. This is\r\nnot seen readily during the stage of fever when the surface is\r\nreddened, but at that time may be detected by pressure on the skin for\r\na minute, when the skin will present a yellow hue on removing the\r\nfinger before the blood returns to the pressure spot. With fall of\r\nfever, and abatement of symptoms after two or three days, the patient,\r\ninstead of going on to recovery may, after a few hours or a day or\r\ntwo, again become very feverish and have vomiting--perhaps of blood or\r\nblack vomit--yellow skin, feeble pulse, failure of kidney action with\r\nsuppression of urine, delirium, convulsions, stupor, and death; or may\r\nbegin to again recover after a few days. Mild fever, slight jaundice,\r\nand absence of bleeding are favorable signs; black vomit, high fever,\r\nand passage of little urine are unfavorable signs. The death rate is\r\nvery variable in different epidemics and among different classes;\r\nanywhere from fifteen to eighty-five per cent. Among the better\r\nclasses it is often not greater than ten per cent in private practice.\r\nHeavy drinkers and those living in unfavorable surroundings are apt to\r\nsuccumb.\r\n\r\n=Prevention.=--Yellow fever, like malaria, is a preventable disease,\r\nand will one day be only a matter of historic interest. Dr. W. C.\r\nGorgas, U. S. A., during 1901, by ridding Havana of the mosquito\r\ncarrying the yellow-fever organism through screening barrels and\r\nreceptacles holding water, and by treating drains, cesspools, etc.,\r\nwith kerosene, succeeded in also eradicating yellow fever from that\r\ncity, so that in the following year there was not one death from this\r\ndisease; whereas, before this time, the average yearly mortality had\r\nbeen 751 deaths in Havana. Spread of the disease is controlled by\r\npreventing access of mosquitoes to the bodies of living or dead\r\nyellow-fever patients; while personal freedom from yellow fever may be\r\nsecured by avoiding mosquito bites, through protection by screens\r\nindoors, and covering exposed parts of the face, hands, and ankles\r\nwith oil of pennyroyal or spirit of camphor, while outdoors.\r\n\r\n=Treatment.=--There is unfortunately no special cure known for yellow\r\nfever such as we possess in malaria. The patient should be well\r\ncovered and surrounded with hot-water bags during chill. It is\r\nadvisable to give a couple of compound cathartic pills or a\r\ntablespoonful of castor oil at the start. Two, or at most three,\r\nten-grain doses of phenacetin at three hours intervals will relieve\r\nthe pain during the early stage. Cracked ice given frequently by the\r\nmouth and the application of a mustard paper or paste (one part\r\nmustard, three parts flour, mixed with warm water and applied between\r\ntwo layers of thin cotton) over the stomach will serve to allay\r\nvomiting. Cold sponging (see Typhoid Fever, p. 232) is the best\r\ntreatment for fever. The black vomit may be arrested by one-quarter\r\nteaspoonful doses of tincture of the chloride of iron, given in four\r\ntablespoonfuls of water, every hour after vomiting. The bowels should\r\nbe moved daily by injection of warm soapsuds. The patient should not\r\nrise from his bed, but should use a bedpan or other receptacle. In\r\naddition, a pint of warm water, containing one-half teaspoonful of\r\nsalt, should be injected into the bowel night and morning and, if\r\npossible, retained by the patient. The object of the latter is by its\r\nabsorption to stimulate the action of the kidneys. The diet should\r\nconsist of milk, diluted with an equal amount of water, broths,\r\ngruels, etc., and only soft food should be given for ten days after\r\nrecovery. Iced champagne in tablespoonful doses at frequent intervals,\r\nor two teaspoonful doses of whisky in a little ice water, given every\r\nhalf hour, relieves vomiting and supports the strength.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[11] See Volume V, p. 76, for detailed methods.--EDITOR.\r\n\r\n[12] See Frontispiece, Vol. V.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n| TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE.                                                |\r\n| ===================                                                |\r\n|                                                                    |\r\n| The following change was made:                                     |\r\n|                                                                    |\r\n|   Part II, Chapter II, Typhoid Fever, Symptoms (p. 225)            |\r\n|                                                                    |\r\n|   Original text:                                                   |\r\n|                                                                    |\r\n|   \"... flushed face, pulse 100 deg., gradually increasing as           |\r\n|                                                        described.\" |\r\n|                                                                    |\r\n|   Changed to:                                                      |\r\n|                                                                    |\r\n|   \"... flushed face, pulse 100, gradually increasing as            |\r\n|                                                        described.\" |\r\n|                                                                    |\r\n| \"Pulse 100\" was preferred over \"temperature 100 deg.\".                 |\r\n|                                                                    |\r\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------+",
