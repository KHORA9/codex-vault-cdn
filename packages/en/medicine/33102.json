Bloodletting Instruments in the National\r\nMuseum of History and Technology. _Smithsonian Studies in History and\r\nTechnology_, number 41, 103 pages, 124 figures, 1979.--Supported by a\r\nvariety of instruments, bloodletting became a recommended practice in\r\nantiquity and remained an accepted treatment for millenia. Punctuated by\r\ncontroversies over the amount of blood to take, the time to abstract it,\r\nand the areas from which to remove it, bloodletters employed a wide range\r\nof instruments. All the major types of equipment and many variations are\r\nrepresented in this study of the collection in the National Museum of\r\nHistory and Technology.\r\n\r\n\r\nOFFICIAL PUBLICATION DATE is handstamped in a limited number of initial\r\ncopies and is recorded in the Institution's annual report, _Smithsonian\r\nYear_.

This catalog is the first of a series\r\non the medical sciences collections in the National Museum of History and\r\nTechnology (NMHT). Bloodletting objects vary from ancient sharp-edged\r\ninstruments to the spring action and automatic devices of the last few\r\ncenturies. These instruments were used in a variety of treatments\r\nsupporting many theories of disease and therefore reflect many varied\r\naspects of the history of medicine. Beginning with an essay sketching the\r\nlong history of bloodletting, this catalog provides a survey of the\r\nvarious kinds of instruments, both natural and man-made, that have been\r\nused throughout the centuries.\r\n\r\nIt is a pleasure to thank the Smithsonian Research Foundation, the\r\nCommonwealth Foundation, and the Houston Endowment for their financial\r\nsupport of this project.\r\n\r\nMiss Doris Leckie, who did much of the preliminary research and organized\r\npart of the collection that led to a draft of this catalog with special\r\nemphasis on the cupping apparatus, receives our highest gratitude. Her\r\npublic lectures on the topic drew much praise. The usefulness of this\r\ncatalog is due in no small part to her devoted efforts.\r\n\r\nFor photographing the Smithsonian objects so well we thank Richard\r\nHofmeister, John Wooten, and Alfred Harrell of the Smithsonian Office of\r\nPrinting and Photographic Services. For analyzing selected objects and\r\nanswering our requests promptly we thank Dr. Robert Organ, chief; Barbara\r\nMiller, conservation director; and Martha Goodway, metallurgist, of the\r\nConservation Analytical Laboratory.\r\n\r\nTo those who helped us to solve specific problems we extend appreciation\r\nto Dr. Arthur Nunes; Dr. Uta C. Merzbach, curator of mathematics, NMHT\r\n(especially for finding the poem by Dr. Snodgrass); and Silvio Bedini,\r\ndeputy director, NMHT, whose enthusiasm and unmatched ability for studying\r\nobjects has sustained us throughout the period of preparation.\r\n\r\nWhile it is traditional to add a reminder that various unnamed people\r\ncontributed to a publication, it is imperative to state here that numerous\r\npeople are essential to the collection, conservation, preservation, and\r\nexhibition of museum objects. Without them no collection would survive and\r\nbe made available to those who come to study, admire or just enjoy these\r\nobjects. We hope this catalog brings out some of the joy as well as the\r\ndifficulties of maintaining a national historical medical collection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  BLOODLETTING INSTRUMENTS\r\n  IN THE\r\n  NATIONAL MUSEUM OF HISTORY AND TECHNOLOGY\r\n\r\n  AUDREY DAVIS and TOBY APPEL[A]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\n\r\nBloodletting, the removal of blood from the body, has been practiced in\r\nsome form by almost all societies and cultures. At various times,\r\nbloodletting was considered part of the medical treatment for nearly every\r\nailment known to man. It was also performed as punishment or as a form of\r\nworship to a Superior Power or Being. It still retains therapeutic value\r\ntoday, although only for an extremely limited range of conditions. In\r\nearly attempts to extract blood from the body, the skin was penetrated in\r\nvarious places with a sharp instrument made of stone, wood, metal,\r\nbristle, or any other rigid material. When it was recognized that a vein\r\nvisible on the surface of the skin as a blue-green stripe contained blood,\r\nthe vein was incised directly. To facilitate \"breathing a vein\" and to\r\nprovide greater safety, more refined and sharper instruments were devised.\r\nAs theories supporting bloodletting grew more complex, so too did the\r\ninstruments.\r\n\r\nSpontaneous forms of bleeding, including nosebleed, menstruation, and\r\nthose instances produced by a blow to any part of the body, apparently\r\ninspired the earliest human bloodletters. The Egyptians claimed that the\r\nhippopotamus rubbed its leg against a sharp reed until it bled to remove\r\nexcess blood from its body.[1] The Peruvians noted that a bat would take\r\nblood from the toe of a sleeping person when the opportunity presented\r\nitself. A deer, and goat, would pick a place near its diseased eye for\r\nrelief.[2] The methods employed by animals increased interest in using\r\nartificial methods for letting blood in man.\r\n\r\nThe devices man has employed to remove blood from the body fall into two\r\nmajor categories: (1) those instruments used for general bloodletting,\r\nthat is, the opening of an artery, or more commonly a vein, and (2) those\r\ninstruments used in local bloodletting. Instruments in the first category\r\ninclude lancets, spring lancets, fleams, and phlebotomes. Associated with\r\nthese are the containers to collect and measure the blood spurting from\r\nthe patient. In the second category are those instruments associated with\r\nleeching and cupping. In both of these methods of local bloodletting, only\r\nthe capillaries are severed and the blood is drawn from the body by some\r\nmeans of suction, either by a leech or by an air exhausted vessel.\r\nInstruments in this category include scarificators, cupping glasses,\r\ncupping devices, and many artificial leeches invented to replace the\r\nliving leech.\r\n\r\nMuch effort and ingenuity was expanded, especially in the eighteenth and\r\nnineteenth centuries, to improve the techniques of bloodletting. In the\r\neighteenth century, delicate mechanical spring lancets and scarificators\r\nwere invented to replace the simpler thumb lancets and fleams. In the\r\nnineteenth century, as surgical supply companies began to advertise and\r\nmarket their wares, many enterprising inventors turned their hand to\r\ndeveloping new designs for lancets and scarificators, pumps, fancy cupping\r\nsets, rubber cups, and all manner of cupping devices and artificial\r\nleeches. If we also consider treatments related to bloodletting, in which\r\nblood is transferred from one part of the body to another, without actual\r\nremoval from the body, then we can add the many inventions devoted to dry\r\ncupping, irritating the body, and exhausting the air around limbs or even\r\nthe entire body. Although many physicians continued to use the traditional\r\ninstruments that had been used for centuries, many others turned eagerly\r\nto the latest gadget on the market.\r\n\r\nBloodletting instruments, perhaps the most common type of surgical\r\ninstrument little more than a century ago, are now unfamiliar to the\r\naverage person. When one sees them for the first time, one is often amazed\r\nat their petite size, careful construction, beautiful materials, and\r\nelegant design. One marvels at spring lancets made of silver, thumb\r\nlancets with delicate tortoise shell handles, and sets of hand-blown cups\r\nin the compartments of a mahogany container with brass and ivory latches\r\nand a red plush lining. Those finding such instruments in their attic or\r\nin a collection of antiques, even if they can determine that the\r\ninstruments were used for bloodletting, often have no idea when the\r\ninstruments were made or how they were used. Frequently a veterinary\r\nspring lancet or fleam is mistaken for a human lancet, or a scarificator\r\nfor an instrument of venesection. Almost nothing has been written to\r\ndescribe these once common instruments and to place them in historical\r\ncontext. Historians who study the history of medical theory usually ignore\r\nmedical practice, and they rarely make reference to the material means by\r\nwhich a medical diagnosis or treatment was carried out. It is hoped that\r\nthis publication will fill a need for a general history of these\r\ninstruments. This history is pieced together from old textbooks of\r\nsurgery, medical encyclopedias, compilations of surgical instruments,\r\ntrade catalogs, and the instruments themselves.\r\n\r\nThe collection of instruments at the National Museum of History and\r\nTechnology of the Smithsonian Institution contains several hundred pieces\r\nrepresenting most of the major types of instruments. Begun in the late\r\nnineteenth century when medical sciences were still part of the Department\r\nof Anthropology, the collection has grown steadily through donations and\r\npurchases. As might be expected, it is richest in bloodletting instruments\r\nmanufactured in America in the nineteenth century. One of its earliest\r\nacquisitions was a set of four flint lancets used by Alaskan natives in\r\nthe 1880s. A major source for nineteenth-century instruments is the\r\ncollection of instruments used by the members of the Medical and\r\nChirurgical Faculty of Maryland, a medical society founded in 1799. The\r\nSmithsonian collection also includes patent models of bloodletting\r\ninstruments submitted to the U.S. Patent Office by nineteenth-century\r\ninventors and transferred to the Smithsonian in 1926.\r\n\r\nBecause we have made an effort to survey every major type of instrument\r\nrelated to bloodletting, it is hoped that this publication will serve as a\r\ngeneral introduction to bloodletting instruments, and not merely a guide\r\nto the Smithsonian collection. With this goal in mind, the catalog of\r\nbloodletting instruments has been preceded by chapters surveying the\r\nhistory of bloodletting and describing, in general terms, the procedures\r\nand instruments that have been used since antiquity for venesection,\r\ncupping, leeching, and veterinary bloodletting. In the course of our\r\nresearch we have consulted several other collections of bloodletting\r\ninstruments, notably the collections of the Wellcome Museum of London, the\r\nArmed Forces Institute of Pathology, the College of Physicians in\r\nPhiladelphia, the Institute of the History of Medicine at the Johns\r\nHopkins University, the Howard Dittrick Medical Museum in Cleveland, and\r\nthe University of Toronto. Illustrations from these collections and\r\nreferences to them have been included in the cases where the Smithsonian\r\ncollection lacks a particular type of instrument.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSources\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile primary sources describing the procedures and presenting theoretical\r\narguments for and against bloodletting are plentiful, descriptions of the\r\ninstruments and their manufacture are often difficult to find. Before the\r\nnineteenth century, one may find illustrations of bloodletting instruments\r\nin the major textbooks on surgery, in encyclopedias such as that of\r\nDiderot, and in compendia of surgical instruments written by surgeons. The\r\ndescriptions following the drawings are often meager and give little\r\nindication of where, when, and how the instruments were produced. Until\r\nwell into the nineteenth century, the tools used by barber-surgeons,\r\nsurgeons, and dentists were made by blacksmiths, silversmiths, and\r\ncutlers. These craftsmen generally left little record of their work. As\r\nthe demand for surgical instruments increased, specialized surgical\r\ninstrument makers began to appear, and the cutler began to advertise\r\nhimself as \"Cutler and Surgical Instrument Maker\" rather than simply\r\n\"Cutler and Scissor Grinder.\" A few advertising cards dating from the\r\neighteenth century may be found, but the illustrated trade catalog is a\r\nproduct of the nineteenth century. Among the earliest compendia/catalogs\r\nof surgical instruments written by an instrument maker, rather than by a\r\nsurgeon, was John Savigny's _A Collection of Engravings Representing the\r\nMost Modern and Approved Instruments Used in the Practice of Surgery_\r\n(London, 1799). This was followed a few decades later by the brochures and\r\ncatalog (1831) of the famous London instrument maker, John Weiss. By the\r\n1840s John Weiss, Charriere of Paris, and a few other instrument makers\r\nhad begun to form surgical supply companies that attempted to market\r\ninstruments over a wide area. While there are a handful of company trade\r\ncatalogs dating from the 1840s, 1850s, and 1860s, the great influx of such\r\ncatalogs came after 1870. Trade catalogs, a major source of information on\r\nthe new instruments of the nineteenth century, provide the historian with\r\nline drawings, short descriptions indicating the mechanism and the\r\nmaterial of which the instrument was composed, prices, and patent status.\r\nFor more details on nineteenth-century instruments one must turn to\r\nbrochures and articles in medical journals introducing the instruments to\r\nthe medical profession. These sources provide the most detailed\r\ndescriptions of how the instruments were constructed, how they were used,\r\nand why they were invented. For many American instruments, the\r\ndescriptions available at the U.S. Patent Office offer illustrations of\r\nthe mechanism and a discussion of why the instrument was considered novel.\r\nOne finds specifications for many bizarre instruments that never appear in\r\ntrade catalogs and may never have been actually sold.\r\n\r\nA final source of information is the instruments themselves. Some are\r\nengraved with the name of the manufacturer, and a few are even engraved\r\nwith the date of manufacture. Some have been taken apart to study the\r\nspring mechanisms and others examined in the Conservation Analytical\r\nLaboratory of the Smithsonian Institution to determine their material\r\ncontent. The documentation accompanying the instruments, while sometimes\r\nin error, may serve to identify the individual artifact by name, place and\r\ndate of manufacture, and to augment our knowledge of the historical\r\nsetting in which these instruments were used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBleeding: The History\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of bloodletting has been marked by controversy. The extensive\r\nliterature on bloodletting contains numerous polemical treatises that both\r\nextol and condemn the practice. Bloodletting was no sooner criticized as\r\nineffective and dangerous than it was rescued from complete abandonment by\r\na new group of zealous supporters.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of Hippocrates (5th century B.C.)--and probably before,\r\nalthough no written record is available--bloodletting had its vocal\r\nadvocates and heated opponents. In the 5th century B.C. Aegimious of Eris\r\n(470 B.C.), author of the first treatise on the pulse, opposed\r\nvenesection, while Diogenes of Appolonia (430 B.C.), who described the\r\nvena cava with its main branches, was a proponent of the practice.\r\nHippocrates, to whom no specific text on bloodletting is attributed, both\r\napproved and recommended venesection.[3]\r\n\r\nThe anatomist and physician Erasistratus (300-260 B.C.), was one of the\r\nearliest physicians to leave a record of why he opposed venesection, the\r\nletting of blood from a vein. Erasistratus, who practiced at the court of\r\nthe King of Syria and later at Alexandria, a celebrated center of ancient\r\nmedicine, recognized that the difficulty in estimating the amount of blood\r\nto be withdrawn and the possibility of mistakenly cutting an artery,\r\ntendon, or nerve might cause permanent damage or even death. Since\r\nErasistratus believed that only the veins carried blood while the arteries\r\ncontained air, he also feared the possibility of transferring air from the\r\narteries into the veins as a result of venesection. Erasistratus was led\r\nto question how excessive venesection differed from committing murder.[4]\r\n\r\nThrough the writings of Aulus Cornelius Celsus (25 B.C.-?), the Roman\r\nencyclopedist, and Galen (ca. A.D. 130-200) venesection was restored as a\r\nform of orthodox medical treatment and remained so for the next fifteen\r\nhundred years. By the time of Celsus, bloodletting had become a common\r\ntreatment. Celsus remarked in his well-known account of early medicine:\r\n\"To let blood by incising a vein is no novelty; what is novel is that\r\nthere should be scarcely any malady in which blood may not be let.\"[5] Yet\r\ncriticism of bloodletting continued, for when Galen went to Rome in A.D.\r\n164 he found the followers of Erasistratus opposing venesection. Galen\r\nopened up discussion with these physicians in two books, _Against\r\nErasistratus_ and _Against the Erasistrateans Dwelling in Rome_. These\r\nargumentative dialectical treatises, together with his _Therapeutics of\r\nVenesection_, in which he presented his theory and practice of\r\nvenesection, established Galen's views on bloodletting, which were not\r\neffectively challenged until the seventeenth century.[6]\r\n\r\nThe fundamental theory upon which explanations of health and disease were\r\nbased, which had its inception in ancient Greek thought and lasted up to\r\nthe eighteenth century, was the humoral theory. Based on the scientific\r\nthought of the Pre-Socratics, the Pythagoreans, and the Sicilians, this\r\ntheory posited that when the humors, consisting of blood, phlegm, yellow\r\nbile, and black bile, were in balance within the body, good health ensued.\r\nConversely, when one or more of these humors was overabundant or in less\r\nthan adequate supply, disease resulted. The humors were paired off with\r\nspecific qualities representing each season of the year and the four\r\nelements according to the well-accepted doctrine of Empedocles, in which\r\nall things were composed of earth, air, fire, and water. Thus, yellow\r\nbile, fire, and summer were contrasted to phlegm, water, and winter, while\r\nblood, air, and spring were contrasted to black bile, earth, and autumn.\r\nWhen arranged diagrammatically, the system incorporating the humors,\r\nelements, seasons, and qualities appears as shown in Figure 1. The\r\nearliest formulation of humoralism was to be found in the physiological\r\nand pathological theory of the Hippocratic treatise, _On the Nature of\r\nMan_.[7]\r\n\r\nPlethora, an overabundance of body humors, including blood, which\r\ncharacterized fevers and inflammations, was properly treated by\r\nencouraging evacuation. This could be done through drugs that purged or\r\nbrought on vomiting, by starvation, or by letting blood. During starvation\r\nthe veins became empty of food and then readily absorbed blood that\r\nescaped into the arteries. As this occurred, inflammation decreased. Galen\r\nsuggested that instead of starvation, which required some time and\r\nevacuated the system with much discomfort to the patient, venesection\r\nshould be substituted to remove the blood directly.[8]\r\n\r\nPeter Niebyl, who has traced the rationale for bloodletting from the time\r\nof Hippocrates to the seventeenth century, concluded that bloodletting was\r\npracticed more to remove excess good blood rather than to eliminate\r\ninherently bad blood or foreign matter. Generally, venesection was\r\nregarded as an equivalent to a reduction of food, since according to\r\nancient physiological theory, food was converted to blood.[9]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 1.--Chart of elements, seasons, and humors.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGalen defined the criteria for bloodletting in terms of extent, intensity,\r\nand severity of the disease, whether the disease was \"incipient,\"\r\n\"present,\" or \"prospective,\" and on the maturity and strength of the\r\npatient.[10] Only a skilled physician would thus know when it was proper\r\nto bleed a patient. Venesection could be extremely dangerous if not\r\ncorrectly administered, but in the hands of a good physician, venesection\r\nwas regarded by Galen as a more accurate treatment than drugs. While one\r\ncould measure with great accuracy the dosages of such drugs as emetics,\r\ndiuretics, and purgatives, Galen argued that their action on the body was\r\ndirected by chance and could not easily be observed by the physician.[11]\r\nHowever, the effects of bloodletting were readily observed. One could note\r\nthe change in the color of the blood removed, the complexion of the\r\npatient, and the point at which the patient was about to become\r\nunconscious, and know precisely when to stop the bleeding.\r\n\r\nGalen discussed in great detail the selection of veins to open and the\r\nnumber of times blood might be withdrawn.[12] In choosing the vein to\r\nopen, its location in respect to the disease was important. Galen\r\nrecommended that bleeding be done from a blood vessel on the same side of\r\nthe body as the disease. For example, he explained that blood from the\r\nright elbow be removed to stop a nosebleed from the right nostril.[13]\r\nCelsus had argued for withdrawing blood near the site of the disease for\r\n\"bloodletting draws blood out of the nearest place first, and thereupon\r\nblood from more distant parts follows so long as the letting out of blood\r\nis continued.\"[14]\r\n\r\nControversy over the location of the veins to be opened erupted in the\r\nsixteenth century. Many publications appeared arguing the positive and\r\nnegative aspects of bleeding from a vein on the same side\r\n(derivative--from the Latin _derivatio_ from the verb _derivare_, \"to draw\r\naway,\" \"to divert\") or the opposite side (revulsion--from the Latin\r\n_revulsio_, \"drawing in a contrary direction\") of the disordered part of\r\nthe body. This debate mirrored a broader struggle over whether to practice\r\nmedicine on principles growing out of medieval medical views or out of\r\nclassical Greek doctrines that had recently been revived and brought into\r\nprominence. The medieval practice was based on the Moslem medical writers\r\nwho emphasized revulsion (bleeding from a site located as far from the\r\nailment as possible).[15] This position was attacked in 1514 by Pierre\r\nBrissot (1478-1522), a Paris physician, who stressed the importance of\r\nbleeding near the locus of the disease (derivative bleeding). He was\r\ndeclared a medical heretic by the Paris Faculty of Medicine and derivative\r\nbleeding was forbidden by an act of the French parliament. In 1518,\r\nBrissot was exiled to Spain and Portugal. In 1539, the celebrated\r\nanatomist, Andreas Vesalius, continued the controversy with his famous\r\n_Venesection Letter_, which came to the support of Brissot.[16]\r\n\r\nOnly with the gradual awareness of the implications of the circulation of\r\nthe blood (discovered in 1628) did discussion of the distinction between\r\nderivative and revulsive bloodletting become passe.[17] Long after the\r\ncirculation of the blood was established, surgical treatises such as those\r\nof Lorenz Heister (1719) recommended removing blood from specific parts of\r\nthe body--such as particular veins in the arm, hand, foot, forehead,\r\ntemples, inner corners of the eye, neck, and under the tongue. In the\r\nnineteenth century this practice was still challenged in the literature as\r\na meaningless procedure.[18] (Figure 2.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_How Much Blood to Take_\r\n\r\nAccording to Galen, safety dictated that the first bloodletting be kept to\r\na minimum, if possible. Second, third, or further bleedings could be taken\r\nif the condition and the patient's progress seemed to indicate they would\r\nbe of value. The amount of blood to be taken at one time varied\r\nwidely.[19]\r\n\r\nGalen appears to have been the first to note the amount of blood that\r\ncould be withdrawn: the greatest quantity he mentions is one pound and a\r\nhalf and the smallest is seven ounces. Avicenna (980-1037) believed that\r\nordinarily there were 25 pounds of blood in a man and that a man could\r\nbleed at the nose 20 pounds and not die.[20]\r\n\r\nThe standard advice to bloodletters, especially in the eighteenth and\r\nnineteenth centuries, was \"bleed to syncope.\" \"Generally speaking,\" wrote\r\nthe English physician and medical researcher, Marshall Hall, in 1836, \"as\r\nlong as bloodletting is required, it can be borne; and as long as it can\r\nbe borne, it is required.\"[21] The American physician, Robley Dunglison,\r\ndefined \"syncope\" in his 1848 medical dictionary as a \"complete and,\r\ncommonly, sudden loss of sensation and motion, with considerable\r\ndiminution, or entire suspension of the pulsations of the heart and the\r\nrespiratory movements.\"[22] Today little distinction is made between shock\r\nand collapse, or syncope, except to recognize that if collapse or syncope\r\npersists, shock will result.\r\n\r\nWe know today that blood volume is about one-fifteenth to one-seventeenth\r\nthe body weight of an adult. Thus an adult weighing 150 pounds has 9 or 10\r\npounds of blood in his body. Blood volume may increase at great heights,\r\nunder tropical conditions, and in the rare disease polycythemia (excess\r\nred blood cells). After a pint of blood is withdrawn from a healthy\r\nindividual, the organism replaces it to some degree within an hour or so.\r\nHowever, it takes weeks for the hemoglobin (the oxygen-bearing substance\r\nin the red blood cells) to be brought up to normal.\r\n\r\nIf blood loss is great (more than 10 percent of the total blood volume)\r\nthere occurs a sudden, systemic fall in blood pressure. This is a\r\nwell-known protective mechanism to aid blood clotting. If the volume of\r\nblood lost does not exceed 30 to 40 percent, systolic, disastolic, and\r\npulse pressures rise again after approximately 30 minutes as a result of\r\nvarious compensatory mechanisms.[23]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 2.--Venesection manikin, 16th century. Numbers\r\nindicate locations where in certain diseases venesection should be\r\nundertaken. (From Stoeffler, 1518, as illustrated in Heinrich Stern,\r\n_Theory and Practice of Bloodletting_, New York, 1915. Photo courtesy of\r\nNLM.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nIf larger volumes than this are removed, the organism is usually unable to\r\nsurvive unless the loss is promptly replaced. Repeated smaller bleedings\r\nmay produce a state of chronic anemia when the total amount of blood and\r\nhemoglobin removed is in excess of the natural recuperative powers.\r\n\r\n\r\n_When to Bleed_\r\n\r\nSelecting a time for bleeding usually depended on the nature of the\r\ndisease and the patient's ability to withstand the process. Galen's\r\nscheme, in contrast to the Hippocratic doctrine, recommended no specific\r\ndays.[24] Hippocrates worked out an elaborate schedule, based on the onset\r\nand type of disease, to which the physician was instructed to adhere\r\nregardless of the patient's condition.\r\n\r\nNatural events outside the body served as indicators for selecting the\r\ntime, site, and frequency of bloodletting during the Middle Ages when\r\nastrological influences dominated diagnostic and therapeutic thought. This\r\nis illustrated by the fact that the earliest printed document relating to\r\nmedicine was the \"Calendar for Bloodletting\" issued in Mainz in 1457. This\r\ntype of calendar, also used for purgation, was known as an\r\n_Aderlasskalender_, and was printed in other German cities such as\r\nAugsburg, Nuremberg, Strassburg, and Leipzig. During the fifteenth century\r\nthese calendars and _Pestblatter_, or plague warnings, were the most\r\npopular medical literature. Sir William Osler and Karl Sudhoff studied\r\nhundreds of these calendars.[25] They consisted of a single sheet with\r\nsome astronomical figures and a diagram of a man (_Aderlassmann_)\r\ndepicting the influence of the stars and the signs of the zodiac on each\r\npart of the body, as well as the parts of the anatomy suitable for\r\nbleeding. These charts illustrated the veins and arteries that should be\r\nincised to let blood for specific ailments and usually included brief\r\ninstructions in the margin. The annotated bloodletting figure was one of\r\nthe earliest subjects of woodcuts. One early and well known _Aderlassmann_\r\nwas prepared by Johann Regiomontanus (Johannes Mueller) in 1473. It\r\ncontained a dozen proper bleeding points, each suited for use under a\r\nsign of the zodiac. Other _Aderlassmanner_ illustrated specific veins to\r\nbe bled. The woodcut produced by the sixteenth-century mathematician,\r\nJohannes Stoeffer, illustrated 53 points where the lancet might be\r\ninserted.[26]\r\n\r\n\"Medicina astrologica\" exerted a great influence on bloodletting.\r\nDetermining the best time to bleed reached a high degree of perfection in\r\nthe late fourteenth and fifteenth centuries with the use of volvella or\r\ncalculating devices adopted from astronomy and navigation. These were\r\ncarried on a belt worn around the waist for easy consultation. Used in\r\nconjunction with a table and a vein-man drawing, the volvella contained\r\nmovable circular calculators for determining the accuracy, time, amount,\r\nand site to bleed for an illness. The dangers of bloodletting elicited\r\nboth civic and national concern and control. Statutes were enacted that\r\nrequired every physician to consult these tables before opening a vein to\r\nminimize the chance of bleeding improperly and unnecessarily. Consultation\r\nof the volvella and vein-man was more important than an examination of the\r\npatient.[27] (Figure 3.)\r\n\r\nFor several centuries, almanacs were consulted to determine the propitious\r\ntime for bleeding. The \"woodcut anatomy\" became a characteristic\r\nillustration of the colonial American almanac. John Foster introduced the\r\n\"Man of Signs,\" as it was called, into the American almanac tradition in\r\nhis almanac for 1678, printed in Boston. Other examples of early American\r\nalmanacs featuring illustrations of bleeding include Daniel Leed's almanac\r\nfor 1693, printed in Philadelphia, and John Clapp's almanac for 1697,\r\nprinted in New York.\r\n\r\nAs in many of the medieval illustrations, the woodcut anatomy in the\r\nAmerican almanac consisted of a naked man surrounded by the twelve signs\r\nof the zodiac, each associated with a particular part of the body (the\r\nhead and face with Aries, the neck with Taurus, the arms with Gemini,\r\netc.). The directions that often accompanied the figure instructed the\r\nuser to find the day of the month in the almanac chart, note the sign or\r\nplace of the moon associated with that day, and then look for the sign in\r\nthe woodcut anatomy to discover what part of the body is governed by that\r\nsign. Bloodletting was usually not specifically mentioned, but it is\r\nlikely that some colonials still used the \"Man of Signs\" or \"Moon's Man\"\r\nto determine where to open a vein on a given day.[28]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 3.--Lunar dial, Germany, 1604. Concentric scales\r\nmark hours of the day, days, months, and special astrological numbers. In\r\nconjunction with other dials, it enables the user to determine the phases\r\nof the moon. (NMHT 30121; SI photo P-63426.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe eighteenth-century family Bible might contain a list of the favorable\r\nand unfavorable days in each month for bleeding, as in the case of the\r\nBible of the Degge family of Virginia.[29]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Barber-Surgeons_\r\n\r\nEven though it was recognized that bleeding was a delicate operation that\r\ncould be fatal if not done properly, it was, from the medieval period on,\r\noften left in the hands of the barber-surgeons, charlatans, and women\r\nhealers. In the early Middle Ages the barber-surgeons flourished as their\r\nservices grew in demand. Barber-surgeons had additional opportunities to\r\npractice medicine after priests were instructed to abandon the practice of\r\nmedicine and concentrate on their religious duties. Clerics were cautioned\r\nrepeatedly by Pope Innocent II through the Council at Rheims in 1131, the\r\nLateran Council in 1139, and five subsequent councils, not to devote time\r\nto duties related to the body if they must neglect matters related to the\r\nsoul.[30]\r\n\r\nBy 1210, the barber-surgeons in England had gathered together and formed a\r\nGuild of Barber-Surgeons whose members were divided into Surgeons of the\r\nLong Robe and Lay-Barbers or Surgeons of the Short Robe. The latter were\r\ngradually forbidden by law to do any surgery except bloodletting, wound\r\nsurgery, cupping, leeching, shaving, extraction of teeth, and giving\r\nenemas.[31] The major operations were in the hands of specialists, often\r\nhereditary in certain families, who, if they were members of the Guild,\r\nwould have been Surgeons of the Long Robe.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 4.--Bleeding bowl with gradations to measure the\r\namount of blood. Made by John Foster of London after 1740. (Held by the\r\nDivision of Cultural History, Greenwood Collection, Smithsonian\r\nInstitution; SI photo 61166-C.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nTo distinguish his profession from that of a surgeon, the barber-surgeon\r\nplaced a striped pole or a signboard outside his door, from which was\r\nsuspended a basin for receiving the blood (Figure 4). Cervantes used this\r\ntype of bowl as the \"Helmet of Mambrino\" in Don Quixote.[32] Special\r\nbowls to catch the blood from a vein were beginning to come into fashion\r\nin the fourteenth century. They were shaped from clay or thin brass and\r\nlater were made of pewter or handsomely decorated pottery. Some pewter\r\nbowls were graduated from 2 to 20 ounces by a series of lines incised\r\naround the inside to indicate the number of ounces of fluid when filled to\r\nthat level. Ceramic bleeding bowls, which often doubled as shaving bowls,\r\nusually had a semicircular indentation on one side to facilitate slipping\r\nthe bowl under the chin. Bowls to be used only for bleeding usually had a\r\nhandle on one side. Italian families had a tradition of passing special\r\nglass bleeding vessels from generation to generation. The great variety in\r\nstyle, color, and size of bleeding and shaving bowls is demonstrated by\r\nthe beautiful collection of over 500 pieces of Dr. A. Lawrence Abel of\r\nLondon and by the collection of the Wellcome Historical Museum, which has\r\nbeen cataloged in John Crellin's _Medical Ceramics_.[33] These collections\r\nillustrate the stylistic differences between countries and periods.\r\n\r\nThe barber-surgeons' pole represented the stick gripped by the patient's\r\nhand to promote bleeding from his arm. The white stripe on the pole\r\ncorresponded to the tourniquet applied above the vein to be opened in the\r\narm or leg. Red or blue stripes appeared on early barber poles, but later\r\npoles contained both colors.[34]\r\n\r\nThe dangers posed by untutored and unskilled bleeders were noted\r\nperiodically. In antiquity Galen complained about non-professional\r\nbleeders, and in the Middle Ages, Lanfranc (1315), an outstanding surgeon,\r\nlamented the tendency of surgeons of his time to abandon bloodletting to\r\nbarbers and women.[35] Barber-surgeons continued to let blood through the\r\nseventeenth century. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the\r\nbetter educated surgeon, and sometimes even the physician, took charge of\r\nbleeding.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bloodletting and the Scientific Revolution_\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the blood's circulation did not result in immediate\r\nchanges in the methods or forms of bloodletting. William Harvey, who\r\npublished his discovery of circulation in 1628, recognized the value of\r\ninvestigating the implications of his theory. Harvey could not explain the\r\ncauses and uses of the circulation but he believed that it did not rule\r\nout the practice of bloodletting. He claimed that\r\n\r\n     daily experience satisfies us that bloodletting has a most salutary\r\n     effect in many diseases, and is indeed the foremost among all the\r\n     general remedial means: vitiated states and plethora of blood, are\r\n     causes of a whole host of disease; and the timely evacuation of a\r\n     certain quantity of the fluid frequently delivers patients from very\r\n     dangerous diseases, and even from imminent death.[36]\r\n\r\nThe English scientist Henry Stubbe brought to the surface what would\r\nappear to be an obvious dilemma: How could one bleed to produce local\r\neffect if the blood circulated? Stubbe commented in 1671:\r\n\r\n     I do say, that no experienced Physician ever denied the operation of\r\n     bloodletting though since the tenet of the Circulation of the Blood\r\n     the manner how such an effect doth succeed admits of some dispute,\r\n     and is obscure. We the silly followers of Galen and the Ancients do\r\n     think it an imbecility of judgement, for any to desert an experienced\r\n     practice, because he doth not comprehend in what manner it is\r\n     effected.[37]\r\n\r\nIn the early nineteenth century the physiologist Francois Magendie\r\n(1783-1855), who argued against bloodletting, showed that the\r\nphysiological effects of opening different veins was exactly the same, and\r\ntherefore the choice of which vein to bleed did not affect the\r\nprocedure.[38]\r\n\r\nThe first serious modern challenges to bloodletting were made in the\r\nsixteenth and seventeenth centuries under the leadership of the German\r\nalchemist Paracelsus and his Belgian follower, Van Helmont. The medical\r\nchemists or iatrochemists espoused explanations for and treatments of\r\ndiseases based on chemical theories and practices. They believed that the\r\nstate of the blood could best be regulated by administering the proper\r\nchemicals and drugs rather than by simply removing a portion of the blood.\r\nIatrochemistry provided a substitution in the form of medicinals to quell\r\nthe flow of blood for therapeutic purposes.[39]\r\n\r\nThe revival of Hippocratic medicine in the late seventeenth and eighteenth\r\ncenturies also led to questioning the efficacy of bloodletting. The\r\nHippocratic treatises, while they occasionally mentioned bloodletting,\r\ngenerally stressed nature's power of cure. This school of medicine\r\nadvocated a return to clinical observation and a reduction of activist\r\nintervention. Treatments such as bloodletting, it was felt by the\r\nneo-Hippocratists, might merely serve to weaken the patient's strength\r\nand hinder the healing processes of nature.[40]\r\n\r\nA rival group of medical theorists also flourished in this period. The\r\niatrophysicists, who concentrated on mechanical explanations of\r\nphysiological events, remained adherents of bloodletting. Their support of\r\nthe practice ensured its use at a time when the first substantial\r\ncriticism of it arose.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Instrumentation and Techniques_\r\n\r\nSharp thorns, roots, fish teeth, and sharpened stones were among the early\r\nimplements used to let blood.[41] Venesection, one of the most frequently\r\nmentioned procedures in ancient medicine, and related procedures such as\r\nlancing abcesses, puncturing cavities containing fluids, and dissecting\r\ntissues, were all accomplished in the classical period and later with an\r\ninstrument called the phlebotome. _Phlebos_ is Greek for \"vein,\" while\r\n\"tome\" derives from _temnein_, meaning \"to cut.\" In Latin, \"phlebotome\"\r\nbecomes \"flebotome,\" and in an Anglo-Saxon manuscript dating from A.D.\r\n1000, the word \"fleam\" appears. The phlebotome, a type of lancet, was not\r\ndescribed in any of the ancient literature, but its uses make it apparent\r\nthat it was a sharp-pointed, double-edged, and straight-bladed cutting\r\nimplement or scalpel similar to the type later used for splitting larger\r\nveins.[42]\r\n\r\nSeveral early Roman examples of phlebotomes have been collected in\r\nEuropean museums. One, now in the Cologne Museum, was made of steel with a\r\nsquare handle and blade of myrtle leaf shape. Another specimen, made of\r\nbronze, was uncovered in the house of the physician of _Strada del\r\nConsulare_ of Pompeii. This specimen, now in the Naples Museum, is 8 cm\r\nlong and 9 mm at the broadest part of the blade, and its handle bears a\r\nraised ring ornamentation.[43] A number of copies of Roman instruments\r\nhave been made and some have passed into museum collections. Some of the\r\ncopies were commissioned by Sir Henry Wellcome for the Wellcome Historical\r\nMedical Museum collection and the Howard Dittrick Historical Medical\r\nMuseum in Cleveland. They emulate the size, color, and aged condition of\r\nthe originals and make it very difficult for the inexpert to distinguish\r\nan original from its replica. It is, however, impossible to fully\r\nduplicate the patina of ancient bronze.[44] Seventeenth-century and later\r\nbloodletting instruments usually have not been copied.[45]\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest examples of the fleam, such as the specimen found at\r\nPompeii, this instrument has been associated with the veterinarian. Since\r\nearly practitioners, particularly the Roman physician, performed the\r\nduties of the surgeon as well as those of the veterinarian, it is possible\r\nthat they used the same instrument to open blood vessels in humans and\r\nanimals.[46]\r\n\r\nIn the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries a type of fleam (German\r\n_fliete_, French _flamette_), which had a pointed edge at right angles to\r\nthe handle, was in use in Germany, Holland, and Vienna, Austria.[47] Since\r\nthe specimens found in museums vary in size, it is likely that this type\r\nof fleam was used on both animals and humans.\r\n\r\nIn about the fifteenth century the thumb lancet, also called a\r\n_gladiolus_, _sagitella_, _lanceola_, _lancetta_, or _olivaris_, was\r\nintroduced.[48] It soon became the preferred instrument for opening a vein\r\nin any part of the body. The double-edged iron or steel blade was placed\r\nbetween two larger covers, usually made of horn or shell, and all three\r\npieces were united at the base with a riveted screw. The blade could be\r\nplaced at various angles of inclination when in use. The shape of the\r\nblade, whether broad or narrow, determined the ease with which the skin\r\nand vein could be penetrated. A long slender blade was essential to pierce\r\na vein located below many layers of fatty tissue.[49] These tiny and\r\ndelicate thumb lancets were often carried in small flat cases of silver,\r\ntortoise shell, shagreen, or leather with hinged tops and separate\r\ncompartments for each lancet. (Figure 5.)\r\n\r\nA surgeon was advised to carry lancets of various sizes and shapes in\r\norder to be prepared to open veins of differing sizes and in different\r\nlocations. Even Hippocrates had cautioned bloodletters not to use the\r\ndifferent size lancets indiscriminately, \"for there are certain parts of\r\nthe body which have a swift current of blood which it is not easy to\r\nstop.\"[50] For vessels that bled easily, it was essential to make narrow\r\nopenings; otherwise it would be difficult, if not impossible, to stop the\r\nflow of the blood. For other vessels, lancets that made larger openings\r\nwere required or the blood would not flow satisfactorily.\r\n\r\nThe blood as it spurted from the vein would be collected in a container\r\nand measured. When enough blood was removed, the bleeding would be\r\nstopped by a bandage or compress applied to the incision.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 5.--18th-19th century lancets and lancet cases. The\r\ncases are made of mother-of-pearl, silver, shagreen, and tortoise shell.\r\n(NMHT 308730.10. SI photo 76-9116.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nTeaching a medical student how to bleed has had a long tradition. Before\r\napproaching a patient, the student practiced opening a vein quickly and\r\naccurately on plants, especially the fruits and stems.[51] The mark of a\r\ngood venesector was his ability not to let even a drop of blood be seen\r\nafter the bleeding basin was removed.[52]\r\n\r\nIt required some degree of skill to strike a vein properly. The most\r\ncommon vein tapped was in the elbow, although veins in the foot were also\r\npopular. The arm was first rubbed and the patient given a stick to grasp.\r\nThen a tourniquet would be applied above the elbow (or, if the blood was\r\nto be taken from the foot, above the ankle), in order to enlarge the veins\r\nand promote a continuous flow of blood. Holding the handle between the\r\nthumb and the first finger, the operator then jabbed the lancet into the\r\nvein. Sometimes, especially if the vein was not close to the surface of\r\nthe skin, the instrument was given an extra impetus by striking it with a\r\nsmall mallet or the fingers to insure puncturing the vein.[53] The\r\nincisions were made diagonally or parallel to the veins in order to\r\nminimize the danger of cutting the vein in two.[54]\r\n\r\nFor superficial veins, the vein was sometimes transfixed, that is, the\r\nblade would be inserted underneath the vessel so that the vessel could not\r\nmove or slip out of reach. The transfixing procedure ensured that the vein\r\nwould remain semi-divided so that blood would continuously pass out of it,\r\nand that injury to other structures would be avoided. Deep-lying veins of\r\nthe scalp, for example, could not be transfixed. They were divided by\r\ncutting through everything overlying them since there were no important\r\nstructures to injure.[55]\r\n\r\nThe consequences of puncturing certain veins incorrectly were discussed by\r\nmany early writers including Galen, Celsus, Antyllus, and Paul of\r\nAegina.[56] Injury to a nearby nerve, muscle, or artery resulted in\r\nconvulsions, excessive bleeding, or paralysis.\r\n\r\nBloodletting was at its most fashionable in the eighteenth and early\r\nnineteenth centuries. In this period it was considered an art to hold the\r\nlancet properly and to support the arm of the patient with delicacy and\r\ngrace.[57] Many patients had by repeated bloodlettings become inured to\r\nits potential danger and unpleasantness. In the mid-eighteenth century one\r\nBritish physician declared: \"People are so familiarized to bleeding that\r\nthey cannot easily conceive any hurt or danger to ensue, and therefore\r\nreadily submit, when constitutional fear is out of the question, to the\r\nopening of a vein, however unskillfully advised.\"[58] In England in the\r\nearly nineteenth century people came to the hospital to be bled in the\r\nspring and fall as part of the ritual for maintaining good health. At some\r\nperiods there were so many people undergoing prophylactic bloodletting\r\nthat they could be seen lying on the floor of the hospital while\r\nrecovering from the faintness induced by venesection.[59]\r\n\r\nThe lancet was perhaps the most common medical instrument. _The Lancet_\r\nwas the name of one of the oldest and most socially aware English medical\r\njournals, founded by Thomas Wakeley in 1823.[60]\r\n\r\nIn America, Benjamin Rush (1746-1813) promoted vomits, purges, salivation,\r\nand especially bleeding. Rush, a signer of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, is notorious in medical history for his resorting to massive\r\nbleedings during the epidemics of yellow fever at the end of the\r\neighteenth century. Rush told a crowd of people in 1793: \"I treat my\r\npatients successfully by bloodletting, and copious purging with calomel\r\nand jalop and I advise you, my good friends, to use the same remedies.\"\r\n\"What?\" called a voice from the crowd, \"Bleed and purge everyone?\" \"Yes,\"\r\nsaid the doctor, \"bleed and purge all Kensington.\"[61]\r\n\r\nThe alternatives to bleeding in this period included administering mercury\r\n(calomel) to promote salivation and tartar emetic to induce vomiting.\r\nThese substitutes could be as hazardous as bleeding and offered little\r\nchoice to the patient who had to bear the unpleasant effects. Thus, the\r\nlate eighteenth and early nineteenth century has been referred to by\r\nhistorians as the era of heroic medicine because of the large amounts of\r\nstrong medications given and excessive bloodletting.[62]\r\n\r\nOne of the most notable victims of heroic medicine during this period was\r\nGeorge Washington (1732-1799), who was bled four times in two days after\r\nhaving contracted a severe inflammation of the throat. Washington's\r\nphysician, Dr. Craik, admitted that the removal of too much blood might\r\nhave been the cause of his death. Additional bleeding was prevented only\r\nby Washington's request to be allowed to die without further medical\r\nintervention, since he believed that his illness was incurable.[63]\r\n\r\nBloodletting was especially resorted to in times of crisis. One woman,\r\nHannah Green, had been anesthetized in 1848 by chloroform before\r\nundergoing a minor operation on her toe. The physician bled her in a\r\nfutile attempt to revive her, but she died, becoming the first known\r\nvictim of inhalation anesthesia.[64]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Spring Lancets_\r\n\r\nThe great vogue in phlebotomy inspired the invention of ingenious\r\ninstruments. From Vienna came the automatic or spring lancet, originally\r\ncalled a _Schnepper_ or _Schnepperlein_, which permitted the operator to\r\ninject the blade into a vein without exerting manual pressure.[65] It was\r\nwidely adopted if the variety of models now extant is a proper indication.\r\nIn the spring lancet, the blade was fixed into a small metal case with a\r\nscrew and arranged to respond to a spring that could be released by a\r\nbutton or lever on the outside of the case. The blade was positioned at\r\nright angles to the spring and case, thus adopting the basic shape of the\r\nfleam. The case of the spring lancet was usually made of copper, silver,\r\nbrass, or an alloy. It was often decorated with engraved furbelows or\r\nembossed with political or other symbols depending on the preference of\r\nthe owner and the fashion of the period. The mechanism of this handsome\r\nimplement has been described by a modern collector (Figures 6, 7):\r\n\r\n     The curved projection (1) is the continuation of a heavy coiled\r\n     spring. When pushed up it catches on a ratchet. A razor sharp blade\r\n     (2), responding to the pressure of a light spring placed under it,\r\n     follows the handle as it goes up. A lever (3) acting on a fulcrum (4)\r\n     when pressed down, releases handle which in turn strikes the lancet\r\n     down with lightning speed.[66]\r\n\r\nThe spring lancet was initially described by Lorenz Heister in 1719.[67]\r\nAnother early description appeared in 1798 in the first American edition\r\nof the _Encyclopedia or Dictionary of Arts and Sciences_, in which the\r\nspring lancet was called a \"phleam.\"[68]\r\n\r\nThe spring lancet for use on humans was a rather tiny instrument. Its\r\ncasing was about 4 cm long and 1.5 to 2 cm wide. The blade added\r\nanother centimeter in length. Larger size instruments, often with a metal\r\nguard over the blade, were made for use on animals. Eighteenth- and early\r\nnineteenth-century spring lancets are found in a wide variety of shapes.\r\nMid- and late nineteenth-century spring lancets are more uniform in shape,\r\nmost having the familiar knob-shaped end. In most lancets the blade was\r\nreleased by a lever, but in the late nineteenth century, the blade of a\r\nmore expensive model was released by a button.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 6.--Spring lancet, 19th century. (NMHT 321636.01; SI\r\nphoto 73-4236.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 7.--Interior of spring lancet. (NMHT 308730.10; SI\r\nphoto 76-13535.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn general, German, American, and Dutch surgeons preferred the spring\r\nlancet to the simple thumb lancet. In contrast, the French tended to\r\nprefer the thumb lancet. Ristelhueber, a surgeon in Strasbourg, maintained\r\nin 1819 that the simple lancet was preferable to the spring lancet both in\r\nterms of simplicity of design and application. While allowing German\r\nsurgeons some credit for attempting to improve the spring lancet,\r\nRistelhueber remained firm in his view that the spring lancet was too\r\ncomplicated and performed no better than the thumb lancet. The only\r\nadvantage of the spring lancet was that it could be used by those who were\r\nignorant of anatomy and the art of venesection. Untutored bleeders could\r\nemploy a spring lancet on those veins that stood out prominently and be\r\nfairly confident that they could remove blood without harming other blood\r\nvessels. The bagnio men (bath attendants), who routinely bled the bathers\r\nin public baths, preferred the spring lancet.[69] It was more difficult to\r\nsever a vein with a spring lancet and thereby cause serious hemorrhaging.\r\nHowever, since the spring lancet was harder to clean because of its small\r\nsize and its enclosed parts, it was more likely to induce infection\r\n(phlebitis).\r\n\r\nWhile the French and British surgeons remained critical of the spring\r\nlancet, it became popular in the United States. John Syng Dorsey, a noted\r\nPhiladelphia surgeon, wrote in 1813:\r\n\r\n     The German fleam or spring lancet I prefer greatly to the common\r\n     English lancet for phlebotomy; it is now in some parts of the United\r\n     States almost exclusively used. In a country situated like the United\r\n     States, where every surgeon, except those residing in our largest\r\n     cities, is compelled to be his own cutler, at least so far as to keep\r\n     his instruments in order, the spring-lancet has a decided preference\r\n     over the lancet; the blade of this can with great ease be sharpened\r\n     by any man of common dexterity, and if not very keen it does no\r\n     mischief, whereas a dull lancet is a most dangerous instrument; and\r\n     no one can calculate with certainty the depth to which it will\r\n     enter. To sharpen a lancet, is regarded by the cutler as one of his\r\n     nicest and most difficult jobs; it is one to which few surgeons are\r\n     competent.\r\n\r\n     The safety of using the fleam is demonstrated by daily experience;\r\n     there is no country in which venesection is more frequently performed\r\n     than in the United States, and perhaps none where fewer accidents\r\n     from the operation have occurred, of those few, I beg leave to state,\r\n     that all the aneurisms produced by bleeding, which I have seen, have\r\n     been in cases where the lancet was used. Among the advantages of the\r\n     spring-lancet economy is not the least. A country practitioner who is\r\n     constantly employing English lancets, and who is particular in using\r\n     none but the best, must necessarily consume half the emoluement\r\n     derived from the operation, in the purchase of his instruments. One\r\n     spring-lancet, with an occasional new blade, will serve him all his\r\n     life.[70]\r\n\r\nThis popularity is also reflected in various medical dictionaries of the\r\neighteenth and nineteenth centuries that described the instrument and in\r\nthe wide variety of spring lancets in the Smithsonian collection.\r\n\r\nOne American user of the spring lancet, J. E. Snodgrass of Baltimore, was\r\ninspired to compose a poem about the instrument, which appeared in the\r\n_Baltimore Phoenix and Budget_ in 1841. He wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\nTo My Spring-Lancet\r\n\r\n  Years have passed since first we met,\r\n  Pliant and ever-faithful-slave!\r\n  Nobly thou standest by me yet,\r\n  Watchful as ever and as brave.\r\n\r\n  O, were the power of language thine,\r\n  To tell all thou hast seen and done,\r\n  Methinks the curious would incline,\r\n  Their ears to dwell they tales upon!\r\n\r\n  I love thee, bloodstain'd, faithful friend!\r\n  As warrior loves his sword or shield;\r\n  For how on thee did I depend\r\n  When foes of Life were in the field!\r\n\r\n  Those blood spots on thy visage, tell\r\n  That thou, thro horrid scenes, hast past.\r\n  O, thou hast served me long and well;\r\n  And I shall love thee to the Last!\r\n\r\n  A thousand mem'ries cluster round thee\r\n  In all their freshness! thou dost speak\r\n  Of friends far distant-friends who found thee\r\n  Aye with thy master, prompt to wreak\r\n\r\n  Vengeance on foes who strove to kill\r\n  With blows well aim'd at heart or head--\r\n  Thieves that, with demon heart and will,\r\n  Would fain have on they vials fed.\r\n\r\n  O, They have blessed thee for thy aid,\r\n  When grateful eyes, thy presence, spoke;\r\n  Thou, anguish'd bosoms, glad hast made,\r\n  And miser's tyrant sceptre broke.\r\n\r\n  Now, when 'mong strangers, is our sphere,\r\n  Thou, to my heart, are but the more\r\n  Endear'd--as many a woe-wring tear\r\n  Would plainly tell, if from me tore!\r\n\r\nThere was little change in the mechanism of the spring lancet during the\r\nnineteenth century, despite the efforts of inventors to improve it.\r\nApproximately five American patents on variations of the spring lancet\r\nwere granted in the nineteenth century. One patent model survives in the\r\nSmithsonian collection. Joseph Gordon of Catonsville, Maryland, in 1857\r\nreceived patent No. 16479 for a spring lancet constructed so that three\r\ndifferent positions of the ratchet could be set by the sliding shield. The\r\nposition of the ratchet regulated the force with which the blade entered\r\nthe vein. This also had the advantage of allowing the blade to enter the\r\nvein at the same angle irrespective of the depth to which it\r\npenetrated.[71]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Decline of Bleeding_\r\n\r\nThroughout the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries, most\r\nphysicians of note, regardless of their explanations of disease, including\r\nHermann Boerhaave, Gerard Van Swieten, Georg Ernst Stahl (phlogiston),\r\nJohn Brown and Friedrich Hoffmann (mechanistic theories), Johann Peter\r\nFrank, Albrecht von Haller, Percival Pott, John Pringle, William Cullen,\r\nand Francois Broussais, recommended bloodletting and adjusted their\r\ntheories to provide an explanation for its value. At the end of the\r\neighteenth century and in the early nineteenth century, the practice of\r\nbloodletting reached a high point with the theories of F.-J.-V. Broussais\r\n(1772-1838) and others. After 1830, however, the practice gradually\r\ndeclined until, by the end of the century, it had all but disappeared.\r\n\r\nThis decline occurred even though many medical theories were brought to\r\nthe defense of bleeding. A French medical observer commented in 1851 that\r\n\"l'histoire de la saignee consideree dans son ensemble, constituerait\r\npresque a elle seule l'histoire de toutes les doctrines medicales\" (the\r\nhistory of bloodletting, considered in its totality, would constitute\r\nalmost by itself the history of all medical doctrines).[72] There was no\r\ncrisis of medical opinion, and no one event to account for this decline.\r\nThe French physician, Pierre Louis's statistical investigation (numerical\r\nmethod) into the effect of bloodletting in the treatment of pneumonia has\r\noften been cited as a cause for the downfall of venesection,[73] but the\r\nresults of Louis's research showed only that bloodletting was not as\r\nuseful as was previously thought. Louis's work, however, was typical of a\r\nnew and critical attitude in the nineteenth century towards all\r\ntraditional remedies. A number of investigators in France, Austria,\r\nEngland, and America did clinical studies comparing the recovery rates of\r\nthose who were bled and those who were not.[74] Other physicians attempted\r\nto measure, by new instruments and techniques, the physiological affects\r\nof loss of blood. Once pathological anatomy had associated disease\r\nentities with specific lesions, physicians sought to discover exactly how\r\nremedies such as bloodletting would affect these lesions. In the case of\r\npneumonia, for example, those who defined the disease as \"an exudation\r\ninto the vessels and tissues of the lungs\" could not see how bloodletting\r\ncould remove the coagulation. John Hughes Bennett, an Edinburgh physician,\r\nwrote in 1855: \"It is doubtful whether a large bleeding from the arm can\r\noperate upon the stagnant blood in the pulmonary capillaries--that it can\r\ndirectly affect the coagulated exudation is impossible.\"[75] Bennett felt\r\nthat bloodletting merely reduced the strength of the patient and thus\r\nimpeded recovery.\r\n\r\nBloodletting was attacked not only by medical investigators, but much more\r\nvehemently by members of such medical sects as the homeopaths and botanics\r\nwho sought to replace the harsh remedies of the regular physicians by\r\ntheir own milder systems of therapeutics.[76]\r\n\r\nAs a result of all this criticism the indications for bleeding were\r\ngradually narrowed, until at the present time bloodletting is used in only\r\na few very specific important instances.\r\n\r\nIn England and America, in the last quarter of the nineteenth century, a\r\nlast serious attempt was made to revive bloodletting before it died out\r\naltogether. A number of Americans defended the limited use of bleeding,\r\nespecially in the form of venesection. The noted American physician, Henry\r\nI. Bowditch, tried in 1872 to arouse support for venesection among his\r\nMassachusetts Medical Society colleagues. He noted that venesection\r\ndeclined more than any other medical opinion in the esteem of the\r\nphysician and the public during the previous half century. At the\r\nbeginning of his career, he had ignored the request of his patients who\r\nwanted annual bloodlettings to \"breathe a vein\" to maintain good health.\r\nHe eventually found that to give up the practice entirely was as wrong as\r\nto overdo it when severe symptoms of a violent, acute cardiac disease\r\npresented themselves. Lung congestion and dropsy were other common\r\ndisorders that seemed to him to be relieved, at least temporarily, by\r\nvenesection.[77]\r\n\r\nIn 1875 the Englishman W. Mitchell Clarke, after reviewing the long\r\nhistory of bloodletting and commenting on the abrupt cessation of the\r\npractice in his own time, wrote:\r\n\r\n     Experience must, indeed, as Hippocrates says in his first aphorism,\r\n     be fallacious if we decide that a means of treatment, sanctioned by\r\n     the use of between two and three thousand years, and upheld by the\r\n     authority of the ablest men of past times, is finally and forever\r\n     given up. This seems to me to be the most interesting and important\r\n     question in connection with this subject. Is the relinquishment of\r\n     bleeding final? or shall we see by and by, or will our successors\r\n     see, a resumption of the practice? This, I take it, is a very\r\n     difficult question to answer; and he would be a very bold man who,\r\n     after looking carefully through the history of the past, would\r\n     venture to assert that bleeding will not be profitably employed any\r\n     more.[78]\r\n\r\nAn intern, Henri A. Lafleur of the newly founded Johns Hopkins Hospital,\r\nreported on five patients on whom venesection was performed between 1889\r\nand 1891. Lafleur defended his interest in the subject by calling\r\nattention to other recent reports of successes with bleeding, such as that\r\nof Dr. Pye-Smith of London. He concluded that at least temporary relief\r\nfrom symptoms due to circulatory disorders, especially those involving the\r\npulmonary system, was achieved through venesection.\r\n\r\nPneumonia and pleurisy were the primary diseases for which venesection was\r\nan approved remedy.[79] It had long been believed by bloodletters that\r\nthese complaints were especially amenable to an early and repeated\r\napplication of the lancet.[80] Austin Flint had explained in 1867 that\r\nbloodletting \"is perhaps more applicable to the treatment of inflammation\r\naffecting the pulmonary organs than to the treatment of other inflammatory\r\naffections, in consequence of the relations of the former [pulmonary\r\norgans] to the circulation.\"[81] Thus, while bloodletting for other\r\ndiseases declined throughout the nineteenth century, it continued to be\r\nadvocated for treating apoplexy, pneumonia, and pulmonary edema.[82]\r\n\r\nThe merit of phlebotomy for those afflicted with congestive heart failure\r\nwas emphasized again in 1912 by H. A. Christian. This condition led to\r\nengorgement of the lungs and liver and increased pressure in the venous\r\nside of the circulation. Articles advocating bloodletting continued into\r\nthe 1920s and 1930s.[83]\r\n\r\nBloodletting is currently being tested as a treatment for those suffering\r\nfrom angina or heart attacks. Blood is removed on a scheduled basis to\r\nmaintain the hematocrit (the percentage of red blood cells in the blood)\r\nat a specified level. Keeping the hematocrit low has provided relief to\r\nthose being tested.[84] Other benefits of removing blood, including the\r\nlowering of blood pressure, can be obtained by the use of antihypertensive\r\ndrugs. Thus the valid indications for bleeding are being supplanted by the\r\nuse of modern drugs that accomplish the same end.\r\n\r\nBy the twentieth century the lancet was replaced in some quarters by safer\r\ndevices for removing blood and injecting fluids into the bloodstream.\r\nHeinrich Stern improved Strauss's special hyperdermic needle. In 1905\r\nStern designed a venepuncture or aspirating needle that was 7 cm long with\r\na silver cannula of 4 cm. Attached to the handle was a thumb-rest and a\r\ntube for removing or adding fluids and a perforator within the cannula. He\r\nrecommended that the forearm be strapped above the elbow and that the\r\ninstrument be thrust into the most prominent vein. This streamlined vein\r\npuncturing implement reduced the possibility of injecting air and bacteria\r\ninto the blood.[85] It was, and continues to be, used to withdraw blood\r\nfor study in the laboratory, to aid in diagnosis of disease, and to\r\ncollect blood for transfusing into those who need additional blood during\r\nan operation or to replace blood lost in an accident or disease. The blood\r\nis collected in a glass or plastic graduated container and stored under\r\nrefrigeration. The study of blood donors has, incidentally, given insights\r\ninto the physiology of bloodletting since the volume customarily removed\r\nfrom a donor is about the same in volume as that taken by a bleeder (one\r\npint or 500 cc).[86]\r\n\r\nThe annual physical examination today includes taking a small amount of\r\nblood from the finger or a vein in the elbow. This blood is then analyzed\r\nfor the presence of biochemical components of such diseases as diabetes,\r\nanemia, arteriosclerosis, etc. A tiny sterile instrument called a blood\r\nlancet may be used by the technician who draws the blood, who is still\r\ncalled by the historical name, phlebotomist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCupping\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Cupping is an art,\" wrote the London cupper Samuel Bayfield in 1823, \"the\r\nvalue of which every one can appreciate who has had opportunities of being\r\nmade acquainted with its curative power by observing its effects on the\r\nperson of others, or by realizing them in his own.\"[87] The curious\r\noperation of taking blood by means of exhausted cups had been part of\r\nWestern medicine since the time of Hippocrates, and has been found in many\r\nother cultures as well. It is still practiced in some parts of the world\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\nSince antiquity medical authors have distinguished two forms of cupping,\r\ndry and wet. In dry cupping, no blood was actually removed from the body.\r\nA cup was exhausted of air and applied to the skin, causing the skin to\r\ntumefy. In wet cupping, dry cupping was followed by the forming of several\r\nincisions in the skin and a reapplication of the cups in order to collect\r\nblood. It was possible to scarify parts of the body without\r\ncupping--through the nineteenth-century physicians recommended scarifying\r\nthe lips, the nasal passages, the eyes, and the uterus. In order to remove\r\nany sizeable amount of blood, however, it was necessary to apply some sort\r\nof suction to the scarifications, because capillaries, unlike arteries and\r\nveins, do not bleed freely. (Figure 8.)\r\n\r\nCupping was generally regarded as an auxiliary to venesection. The\r\nindications for the operation were about the same as the indications for\r\nphlebotomy, except that there was a tendency to prefer cupping in cases of\r\nlocalized pain or inflammation, or if the patient was too young, too old,\r\nor too weak to withstand phlebotomy. \"If cutting a vein is an instant\r\ndanger, or if the mischief is still localised, recourse is to be had\r\nrather to cupping,\" wrote the encyclopedist Celsus in the first century\r\nA.D.[88]\r\n\r\nAs noted above, the ancients usually recommended cupping close to the seat\r\nof the disease. However, there were several examples in ancient writings\r\nof cupping a distant part in order to divert blood. The most famous of\r\nthese examples was Hippocrates' recommendation of cupping the breasts in\r\norder to relieve excessive menstruation.[89]\r\n\r\nAs was the case for phlebotomy, the number of ills that were supposedly\r\nrelieved by cupping was enormous. Thomas Mapleson, a professional cupper,\r\ngave the following list of \"diseases in which cupping is generally\r\nemployed with advantage\" in 1801:\r\n\r\n     Apoplexy, angina pectoris, asthma, spitting blood, bruises, cough,\r\n     catarrh, consumption, contusion, convulsions, cramps, diseases of the\r\n     hip and knee joints, deafness, delirium, dropsy, epilepsy,\r\n     erysipelas, eruptions, giddiness, gout, whooping cough,\r\n     hydrocephalus, head ache, inflammation of the lungs, intoxication,\r\n     lethargy, lunacy, lumbago, measles, numbness of the limbs,\r\n     obstructions, ophthalmia, pleurisy, palsy, defective perspiration,\r\n     peripneumony, rheumatism, to procure rest, sciatica, shortness of\r\n     breath, sore throat, pains of the side and chest.[90]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Early Cupping Instruments_\r\n\r\nMapleson believed that cupping was first suggested by the ancient practice\r\nof sucking blood from poisoned wounds. In any case, the earliest cupping\r\ninstruments were hollowed horns or gourds with a small hole at the top by\r\nwhich the cupper could suck out the blood from scarifications previously\r\nmade by a knife. The Arabs called these small vessels \"pumpkins\" to\r\nindicate that they were frequently applied to a part of the body in which\r\nthe organs contained air or that they were vessels that had to be\r\nevacuated before they could be applied.[91] The use of cattle horns for\r\ncupping purposes seems to have been prevalent in all periods up to the\r\npresent. When Prosper Alpinus visited Egypt in the sixteenth century, he\r\nfound the Egyptians using horns that were provided with a small valve of\r\nsheepskin to be maintained in place by the cupper's tongue and serving to\r\nprevent the intake of air once the cup was exhausted.[92]\r\n\r\nIn nineteenth-century America, at least one physician still recommended\r\nhorns as superior to glass cups for rural medical practice. A Virginia\r\nphysician, Dr. W. A. Gillespie, disturbed by the high cost of cupping\r\ninstruments, suggested to his readers in _The Boston Medical and Surgical\r\nJournal_ for 1834 that since glass cups were often broken when carried\r\nfrom place to place, \"an excellent substitute can be made of a small cow\r\nhorn, cornicula, which may be scraped or polished until perfectly\r\ndiaphanous or transparent.\"[93]\r\n\r\nThe Smithsonian collection contains a cow's horn from Madaoua, Niger\r\nRepublic (West Africa), used for drawing blood in the 1960s. The director\r\nof the Baptist Mission, who sent the horn, noted that he had often seen\r\nAfricans sitting in the market place with such horns on their backs or\r\ntheir heads. Scarifications were made with a handmade razor.[94]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 8.--Scarification without cupping in Egypt in the\r\n16th century. To obtain sufficient blood, 20 to 40 gashes were made in the\r\nlegs and the patient was made to stand in a basin of warm water. (From\r\nProsper Alpinus, _Medicina Aegyptorum_, Leyden, 1719. Photo courtesy of\r\nNLM.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to horn cups, the ancients employed bronze cups in which a\r\nvacuum was obtained by inserting a piece of burning flax or linen into the\r\ncup before its application to the skin. Most Greek and Roman cups were\r\nmade of metal.[95] Although Galen already preferred glass cups to metal\r\ncups for the simple reason that one could see how much blood was being\r\nevacuated, metal cups were used until modern times. Their main virtue was\r\nthat they did not break and thus could be easily transported. For this\r\nreason, metal cups were especially useful to military surgeons. Brass and\r\npewter cups were common in the eighteenth century, and tin cups were sold\r\nin the late nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nSince the latter part of antiquity, cups have been made of glass. The\r\nSmithsonian possesses two Persian opaque glass cups dating from the\r\ntwelfth century, called \"spouted glasses\" because of the spout protruding\r\nfrom the side of the cup by which the cupper exhausted the air with his\r\nmouth. Similar spouted glasses were illustrated by Prosper Alpinus\r\n(sixteenth century), so designed that the blood would collect in a\r\nreservoir instead of being sucked into the cupper's mouth. Like the horn\r\ncups illustrated by Alpinus, the glass cups were provided with a small\r\nvalve made of animal skin. It appears that the sixteenth-century Egyptians\r\nwere not familiar with the use of fire for exhausting cups. (Figure 9.)\r\n\r\nCupping and leeching were less frequently practiced in the medieval\r\nperiod, although general bloodletting retained its popularity.[96] When\r\nthe eastern practice of public steam baths was reintroduced into the West\r\nin the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, cupping tended to\r\nbe left in the hands of bath attendants (Bagnio men) and ignored by\r\nregular surgeons. Some surgeons, such as Pierre Dionis, who gave a course\r\nof surgery in Paris in the early eighteenth century, saw little value in\r\nthe operation. He felt that the ancients had greatly exaggerated the\r\nvirtues of the remedy.[97] Another French surgeon, Rene de Garengeot,\r\nargued in 1725 that those who resorted to such outdated remedies as\r\ncupping had studied the philosophical systems of the ancients more than\r\nthey had practiced medicine. He accused the admirers of the ancients of\r\nwishing to kill patients \"with the pompous apparatus of wet cupping.\"[98]\r\n(Figure 10.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 9.--Persian spouted cupping glass, 12th century.\r\n(NMHT 224478 [M-8037]; SI photo 73-4215.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nNineteenth-century cuppers tended to blame the baths for the low status of\r\ncupping among surgeons. Dionis had described the baths in Germany as great\r\nvaulted halls with benches on two sides, one side for men and the other\r\nfor women. Members of both sexes, nude except for a piece of linen around\r\nthe waist, sat in the steamy room and were cupped, if they so desired, by\r\nthe bath attendants. The customers' vanity was satisfied by making the\r\nscarifications (which left scars) in the form of hearts, love-knots, and\r\nmonograms.[99] Mapleson's complaint against the baths in 1813 was typical\r\nof the reaction of the nineteenth-century professional cupper:\r\n\r\n     The custom which appears to have become prevalent of resorting to\r\n     these Bagnios, or Haumaums, to be bathed and cupped, appears to have\r\n     superseded the practice of this operation by the regular surgeons.\r\n     Falling into the hands of mere hirelings, who practiced without\r\n     knowledge, and without any other principle than one merely mercenary,\r\n     the operation appears to have fallen into contempt, to have been\r\n     neglected by Physicians, because patients had recourse to it without\r\n     previous advice, and disparaged by regular Surgeons, because, being\r\n     performed by others, it diminished the profits of their\r\n     profession.[100]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 10.--Cupping in the bath, 16th century. (From a\r\nwoodcut held by the Bibliotheque Nationale. Photo courtesy of NLM.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a period of neglect, cupping enjoyed renewed popularity in the late\r\neighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. In that period a number of\r\nprofessional cuppers practiced in the cities of Europe and America. Both\r\nGuy's and Westminster Hospitals in London employed a professional cupper\r\nto aid physicians and surgeons. Of these hospital cuppers, at least four,\r\nThomas Mapleson, Samuel Bayfield, George Frederick Knox, and Monson Hills\r\npublished treatises on the art of cupping, from which we gain the clearest\r\naccount of cupping procedure.[101] Knox, who succeeded Mapleson as Cupper\r\nat Westminster Hospital, was petitioned by 59 medical and surgical\r\nstudents to write his practical and portable text.[102]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Instruments of the Professional Cupper_\r\n\r\nCupping instruments in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were\r\ngenerally simple dome-shaped glass cups provided with thick rims so that\r\nthe cups would be less painful when applied and removed. Cups were sold in\r\nvarious sizes, ranging from about 45 mm to 75 mm high. Some were made with\r\na smaller diameter and a larger belly for cupping on parts of the body\r\nwith a limited surface area. For the same reason, cups with an oval rim\r\nwere recommended. (Figure 11.)\r\n\r\nThere were several common methods for exhausting cups, of which the\r\nsimplest and most widely used was that of throwing burning lint or tow\r\n(the coarse part of flax, hemp, or jute) inside the glass before applying\r\nthe glass to the skin of the patient. The professional cuppers vehemently\r\ndisapproved of this clumsy practice, for the patient could easily be\r\nscorched.[103] Various improvements were suggested to avoid burning the\r\npatient. Dionis (1708) had recommended placing a small card with lighted\r\ncandles over the scarifications, and then applying the cup.[104] Other\r\nmethods included the brief introduction of a wire holding a bit of sponge\r\nsoaked with alcohol and ignited, or attaching a bit of sponge to the\r\ninside of the glass by means of wax and a piece of wood. All such methods\r\nwere deemed \"clumsy expedients\" by professional cuppers,[105] who\r\npreferred to employ a lamp or torch especially made for cupping.\r\nEighteenth-century surgical texts illustrated brass grease lamps with\r\ncovers to regulate the flame. Probably less difficult to maneuver was the\r\nalcohol lamp first introduced in the 1790s. Alcohol lamps for cupping were\r\nmade of metal, shaped like teapots, and contained a heavy cotton wick\r\nprotruding from the spout.[106]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 11.--Typical glass cupping cups, late 19th century.\r\n(NMHT 152130 [M-4766-68]; SI Photo 61135-C.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough Mapleson (1813) employed an alcohol lamp, the cuppers writing\r\nafter him preferred the more recently-introduced cupping torch. This\r\nconsisted of a piece of hollow metal tubing cut obliquely at one end and\r\nprovided with a metal bulb or ring at the other end. A cotton wick was\r\nstuffed as compactly as possible into the tube so that a small piece of\r\nwick protruded from the oblique end. The wick was dipped in alcohol,\r\nignited, and inserted briefly into the cup. The torch was more convenient\r\nthan the older teapot lamp because it was easier to insert into the cup,\r\nand was small enough to hold in the hand at the same time as one held the\r\nscarificator.[107]\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the scarificator represented the major change in the\r\nart of cupping between antiquity and the nineteenth century. Unlike later\r\nattempts at improving cupping technology, the scarificator was almost\r\nuniversally adopted. Previous to its invention, the cupper, following\r\nancient practice, severed the capillaries by making a series of parallel\r\nincisions with a lancet, fleam, or other surgical knife.[108] This was a\r\nmessy, time consuming, and painful procedure. Ambroise Pare (1510?-1590)\r\nwas the first to employ the word \"scarificator\" and the first to\r\nillustrate a special instrument for scarification in his compendium of\r\nsurgical instruments.[109] However, a precursor to the scarificator had\r\nbeen suggested by Paulus of Aegina (625-690), who described an instrument\r\nconstructed of three lancets joined together so that in one application\r\nthree incisions could be made in the skin. The instrument, recommended for\r\nthe removal of coagulated blood in the wake of a blow, was considered\r\ndifficult to use and was not generally adopted.[110] Pare's scarificator\r\nhad a circular case and eighteen blades attached to three rods projecting\r\nfrom the bottom. A pin projecting from the side may have served to lift\r\nthe blades and a button on the top to release them although Pare did not\r\ndescribe the spring mechanism.[111] Pare did not recommend the instrument\r\nfor cupping, but rather for the treatment of gangrene. Several sixteenth-\r\nand seventeenth-century surgical texts made reference to Pare's\r\ninstrument, among them Jacques Delechamps (1569) and Hellkiah Crooke\r\n(1631).[112]\r\n\r\nIt is not known who made the first square scarificator and adapted it to\r\ncupping. The instrument was not found in Dionis (1708), but it did appear\r\nin Heister (1719) and in Garengeot (1725). Thus it appears that the\r\nscarificator was invented between 1708 and 1719. Garengeot disliked\r\ncupping in general and he had little good to say of the new mechanical\r\nscarificator. \"A nasty instrument,\" he called it, \"good only for\r\nshow.\"[113] The German surgeon, Lorenz Heister, was more appreciative of\r\nthe innovation. After describing the older method of making sixteen to\r\ntwenty small wounds in the skin with a knife, he announced that \"The\r\nmodern surgeons have, for Conveniency for themselves and Ease to the\r\nPatient, contrived a Scarificator ... which consists of 16 small\r\nLancet-blades fixed in a cubical Brass Box, with a Steel Spring.\"[114]\r\nHeister noted that while Pare had used the scarificator only for incipient\r\nmortification, it was now \"used with good success by our Cuppers in many\r\nother Diseases, as I myself have frequently seen and experienced.\"[115]\r\n\r\nThe earliest scarificators were simple square brass boxes, with cocking\r\nand release levers and 16 pointed blades. By 1780, illustrations in\r\nsurgical works showed that the bottom of the scarificator was detachable.\r\nThus, although the illustrations do not show the screw for regulating the\r\nheight of the blade cover, provision may already have been made for\r\nadjusting the depth of cut of the blades.[116] Square or German-style\r\nscarificators continued to be sold in Germany throughout the nineteenth\r\ncentury. The earlier models (late eighteenth, early nineteenth century)\r\nwere frequently embellished with ornate decoration, and had pointed\r\nblades. Some were quite tall. A specimen dated 1747, in the Wellcome\r\nMedical Museum collection, is 14.4 cm high and 4.5 cm wide at the base.\r\n(Figure 12.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 12.--Lavishly decorated scarificator, 18th century.\r\n(Held by the Wellcome Institute of the History of Medicine, London. Photo\r\ncourtesy of the Wellcome.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe later models (mid- to late nineteenth century) were wider and plainer\r\nand had arched or crescent shaped blades (which made a cleaner lesion),\r\nbut the internal mechanism remained the same. Square scarificators all had\r\n16 steel blades that cut in the same direction and were arranged on three\r\nrods of five, six, and five blades respectively. At one end of each rod\r\nwas a gear pinion. The cocking lever, protruding through an aperture at\r\nthe top of the scarificator, broadened out into a flat plate with as many\r\ngear sectors as blade rods. The plate was held against the interior of the\r\nscarificator by a heavy support rod running the width of the scarificator,\r\nin such a way that the gear sectors of the cocking lever meshed with the\r\npinions on the blade rods. Pulling up on the cocking lever turned the\r\nblades 180 degrees. A heavy flat cantilever spring, attached at one end to\r\nthe bottom of the case, was caught under a protuberance on the cocking\r\nlever and bent as the cocking lever was pulled. As the blades were turned,\r\na catch slipped over a tooth on the cocking lever, and held the blades in\r\nplace. Nineteenth-century octagonal scarificators generally had two\r\ncatches, the first exposing the blades, and the second rotating them a\r\nfull 180 degrees. Pressure on the release lever pushed the catch off the\r\ntooth on the cocking lever, thereby releasing the lever and allowing the\r\nspring to snap the apparatus back to its original position. Releasing the\r\nspring brought the blades around so quickly that their movement could not\r\nbe seen. (Figure 13.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 13.--Interior of square scarificator. (NMHT 152130\r\n[M-4771]; SI photo 76-9111.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the square scarificators, the top and two sides were detachable from\r\nthe bottom and the other two sides. Turning the wing-tip nut on the top of\r\nthe scarificator lowered, by means of a yoke, the bottom of the\r\nscarificator that was fitted by grooves into the top. By raising and\r\nlowering the bottom, one could regulate the length of blade protruding\r\nbeyond the bottom, and hence the depth of cut.\r\n\r\nIn the 1790s, the octagonal scarificator that was to become the standard\r\nEnglish-American model began to appear in surgical texts. The early\r\noctagonal scarificator, as illustrated in Latta (1795) and Bell (1801),\r\nhad sixteen rounded blades arranged as in the square scarificator, an iron\r\ntriggering lever similar to that of the square scarificator, a button\r\nrelease on the side, and a flat key on top for regulating depth of\r\ncut.[117] Early in the nineteenth century the flat keys were replaced by\r\nround screws. Only the bottom or blade cover of the octagonal scarificator\r\nwas detachable. In some of the octagonal scarificators, the round screw on\r\ntop ran the height of the scarificator and screwed directly into an\r\ninternally threaded post inside the blade cover. In other scarificators,\r\nthe screw raised and lowered a yoke whose two sides were attached by\r\nadditional screws to side projections of the blade cover.\r\n\r\nA notable improvement was made in the early nineteenth century when John\r\nWeiss, a London instrument maker, introduced a 12 blade octagonal\r\nscarificator whose blades, arranged on two rods or pinions, were made to\r\ncut in opposite directions. This advance was mentioned by Mapleson in 1813\r\nand adopted by London professional cuppers thereafter. The advantage of\r\nthe innovations was that the skin was thereby stretched, and a smoother,\r\nmore regular cut could be made. Weiss's Improved Scarificator also\r\nfeatured blades that could easily be removed for cleaning and repair. In\r\nplace of two rows of six blades, one could insert a single row of four\r\nblades to adopt the scarificator for cupping on small areas such as the\r\ntemple.[118] The feature of inserting a pinion with clean and sharp blades\r\npermitted the cupper to own only two scarificators. For cleansing the\r\nblades the manufacturer supplied a thin piece of wood covered with wash\r\nleather or the pith of the elder tree.[119]\r\n\r\nScarificators in which the blade rods turned in opposite directions\r\n(called \"reversible\" scarificators in trade catalogs) were more\r\ncomplicated to manufacture and therefore somewhat more expensive than\r\nunidirectional scarificators. The cocking lever meshed directly with only\r\nthe first blade rod. To make the second blade rod turn in the opposite\r\ndirection, an extra geared plate (or idler lever) was necessary to act as\r\nan intermediary between the cocking lever and the second blade pinion. The\r\ncocking lever turned the idler lever, which then turned the second pinion.\r\nTwo support rods and two cantilever springs were needed in place of the\r\none in unidirectional scarificators.\r\n\r\nThe brass, octagonal scarificator with 8, 10, and particularly 12 blades\r\nbecame the standard scarificator sold in England and America.[120] Both\r\nunidirectional (\"plain\") and reversible scarificators were offered through\r\ntrade catalogs. Smaller octagonal scarificators with four to six blades\r\nwere sold for cupping parts of the body with limited surface area.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cupping Procedure_\r\n\r\nThe art of cupping, it was generally agreed, required a high degree of\r\ndexterity that could be maintained only by constant practice. Professional\r\ncuppers were concerned with avoiding any appearance of clumsiness, else\r\nthe patient might come to fear an operation essential to his health. In\r\nthe hands of an inexperienced physician or surgeon, cupping could be\r\nhighly painful to the patient, and yet fail to produce the requisite\r\namount of blood. While expert cuppers were usually available in cities,\r\nthe rural doctor was not trained in the operation. It was to these rural\r\npractitioners that the treatises of the professional cuppers were\r\naddressed. One cupper, George Frederick Knox, offered in addition personal\r\ninstruction in cupping procedures. His charge was a guinea for medical\r\nstudents and three guineas for non-medical students for a three month\r\ncourse.[121]\r\n\r\nPhysicians and surgeons took a renewed interest in cupping in the early\r\nnineteenth century. Cupping was no longer regarded as merely a useful\r\nsubstitute for bloodletting. Recent physiological research seemed to prove\r\nto the advocates of cupping that the effects of slow withdrawal of blood\r\nfrom the capillaries produced a different effect on the constitution than\r\nthe quick withdrawal of blood from a vein. Thus, Knox was convinced by the\r\nresults of this research that, while phlebotomy was indicated in cases of\r\nhigh fever, \"particular phlegmasiae\" specifically required the\r\nintervention of cupping.[122]\r\n\r\nThe procedure that the experts followed in wet cupping was as follows.\r\nFirst, the cups were immersed in hot water. Bayfield recommended that one\r\nglass be used for every four ounces of blood required. Thus, to abstract\r\n18 to 20 ounces, as was common in cupping on the back or abdomen, four or\r\nfive glasses were needed. The spot chosen for placement of the cups should\r\nbe free of bone, but also not overly fatty. Cupping over the belly of a\r\nmuscle was especially recommended. After the spot was fomented with hot\r\nwater, the torch was dipped in alcohol, lit, and inserted into the cup for\r\nabout two seconds. Once the torch was removed, the cup was allowed to sink\r\nof its own weight into the skin. During the minute that the skin was\r\nallowed to tumefy under the cup, the scarificator was warmed in the palm\r\nof the hand in preparation for the most difficult part of the operation.\r\nIt required great skill to manage torch, scarificator, and cups in such a\r\nway as to lift the cup, scarify, and recup before the tumefaction had\r\nsubsided. Monson Hills (1834) described the manipulations involved thus:\r\n\r\n     The torch is held in and across the palm of the right hand, by the\r\n     little and ring finger, leaving the thumb, the fore and middle\r\n     fingers free to hold the scarificator, which may be done by the thumb\r\n     and fore finger only; the glass is then grasped by the thumb, fore\r\n     and middle fingers of the left hand, leaving the little and ring\r\n     fingers free; the edge of the glass is then detached from the skin by\r\n     the middle finger of the right hand; the scarificator being set, care\r\n     must be taken not to press upon the button with the thumb too\r\n     quickly; directly the glass comes off, we apply the scarificator,\r\n     spring it through the integuments, and then placing it between the\r\n     free little and ring fingers of the left hand, we apply the torch to\r\n     the glass, and glass to the skin over the incisions, as before\r\n     recommended.[123]\r\n\r\nHills recommended practicing on a table, \"taking care, of course, that the\r\nlancets are not allowed to strike the table.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Bayfield, the blades of the scarificator were generally set\r\nat 1/4\". If cupping behind the ears, they should be set at 1/7\", if on the\r\ntemple at 1/8\", and if on the scalp at 1/6\". When the cups were two-thirds\r\nfull, they were removed and reapplied if necessary. This, too, was no easy\r\ntask. One had to manipulate cup and sponge deftly in order to avoid\r\nspillage. Cupping was to be not merely a neat operation, but an elegant\r\none. After cupping, the wound was dabbed with alcohol or dressed, if\r\nnecessary. Scarificator blades could be used some twenty times. After each\r\nuse, the scarificator was to be cleaned and greased by springing it\r\nthrough a piece of mutton fat.[124]\r\n\r\nA great variety of bodily parts were cupped, just about any part that had\r\nsufficient surface area to hold a small cup in place. Knox, for example,\r\ngave directions for cupping on the temple, back of the head, behind the\r\nears, throat, back of the neck, extremities, shin, chest, side, abdomen,\r\nback and loins, back of the thighs, perineum, sacrum, and on buboes.[125]\r\nIn reply to those who wondered if cupping hurt, Knox asserted that \"those\r\nwho calculate the pain incurred in cupping by comparison with a cut finger\r\nare very much deceived.\" The scarificator itself produced little pain, he\r\nclaimed, but he admitted that the pressure of the rims of the glasses\r\ncould cause a degree of discomfort.[126]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nineteenth Century Attempts to Improve Cupping Technology_\r\n\r\nThe story of nineteenth-century attempts to improve cupping technology is\r\nan interesting one, in that a great deal of effort was expended on\r\ncomparatively short-lived results. For those who were adept at cupping,\r\nthe cups, torch, and standard scarificator were quite adequate.\r\nInnovations were thus aimed at making the operation more available to the\r\nless practiced. The new gadgets could not rival the traditional\r\ninstruments in the hands of an experienced cupper, and, moreover, they\r\nwere usually much more expensive.\r\n\r\nMost of the attempts at innovation centered in eliminating the need for an\r\nalcohol lamp or torch to exhaust the cups. As far back as Hero of\r\nAlexandria,[127] we find directions for the construction of \"a\r\ncupping-glass which shall attract without the aid of fire.\" Hero's device\r\ncombined mouth suction with a system of valves. Another famous inventor of\r\nassorted devices, Santorio Santorii (1561-1636), described a cup that\r\ncontained a syringe in the early seventeenth century.[128] From the 1780s\r\non, cups with brass syringes began to appear in compendia of instruments.\r\nA cup with brass fixings would be screwed onto a brass pump, placed on the\r\nskin, and the air within removed by a few strokes of the piston.[129] This\r\nsounded better in theory than it worked in practice. Expert cuppers agreed\r\nthat they thoroughly disliked using the syringe. Mapleson (1813) offered\r\nthree strong objections to the instrument. First, exhaustion could easily\r\nbe carried too far, so as to obstruct the flow of blood. Second, the\r\noperation become tedious and fatiguing to the bloodletter because of the\r\nrepeated screwing and unscrewing of syringe and glasses. Third, the valves\r\nwere liable to malfunction.[130] Twenty-three years later Knox continued\r\nto disapprove of the syringe for the very same reasons. Of all the new\r\ninventions for cupping, he declared in 1836, \"the worst is the syringe, as\r\nit makes that a most complicated and bungling operation that which, with\r\ncommon care and attention is one of the most simple in surgery.\"[131]\r\n\r\nDespite rejection by experienced cuppers, manufacturing of an air-tight\r\nsyringe continued to challenge inventors throughout the nineteenth\r\ncentury. Some attempted to substitute stopcocks for valves, and some to\r\nplace long flexible tubes between pump and glasses so that the pumping\r\nmotions would not be communicated to the patient. Pumps were gradually\r\nimproved, and, although rarely recommended by experts, were sold in great\r\nnumbers as part of fancy and expensive cupping sets. These sets, with\r\nprices as high as fifteen dollars, consisted of a mahogany or leather box\r\nwith brass latches, lined in plush, and containing compartments for\r\nscarificators, a brass pump, and an assortment of glasses provided with\r\nmetal attachments. Some of the most elegant of the cupping sets were those\r\nmade by Maison Charriere of Paris. Today the luxury of these cupping sets\r\nseems rather incongruous with the bloody purposes for which the\r\ninstruments were used. Yet, the beauty of the instruments and their\r\ncontainers must have added to the esteem of the physician or surgeon in\r\nthe mind of the patient.\r\n\r\nSyringes were not only useful in cupping but also were employed in a wide\r\nvariety of medical and surgical operations. Creating an all-purpose\r\nsyringe that would extract or inject liquids into any part of the body was\r\nyet another inventor's dream. Two of the earliest English surgical patents\r\nwere awarded to two such syringes. John Read (1760-1847), surgical\r\ninstrument maker for the British Army and the East India Company, patented\r\na pump in 1820 for use in \"extracting poison from the stomach,\r\nadministering clysters, introducing tabacco fumes into the bowels,\r\ntransfusion of blood, draining off the urine, injecting the bladder,\r\nfemale injection, anatomical injection, administration of food and\r\nmedicine, cupping, drawing the breasts ... &c.\"[132] John Weiss, inventor\r\nof the improved scarificator, invented his own patent syringe in 1825,\r\nwhich he claimed to be superior to all previous syringes because it\r\nemployed stopcocks in place of valves, which were subject to leakage and\r\nclogging. Cupping was only one of many operations that could be performed\r\nwith its aid. The Truax Surgical Pump is an example of a late\r\nnineteenth-century all-purpose patent pump outfit that included cups among\r\nits numerous optional attachments.[133] (Figure 14.)\r\n\r\nThose who went a step further in their efforts to improve cupping\r\nprocedure attempted to combine cup, lancet, and exhausting apparatus all\r\nin one instrument. Bayfield described and rejected several such devices in\r\n1823, including perhaps the earliest, that of the Frenchman, Demours.\r\nDemours' instrument, first introduced in 1819, consisted of a cupping\r\nglass with two protruding tubes, one containing a lancet, and the other an\r\nexhausting syringe. The lancet, surrounded by leather to keep air out of\r\nthe cup, could be supplemented by a cross with four additional blades, if\r\nmore than one puncture was desired.[134] In 1819, Thomas Machell, a member\r\nof the Royal College of Surgeons in London, described a similar apparatus\r\nin which the glass cup was separated from the tin body of the apparatus by\r\na flexible tube. The facility and precision of the instrument, claimed\r\nMachell, \"are incalculably surpassed by the power of its application to\r\nany part whatever of the surface, under any circumstances indicating its\r\npropriety, and by any person untrained to the manual dexterity of a\r\nprofessed cupper.\"[135]\r\n\r\nProfessional cuppers who took pride in their skill naturally avoided such\r\nnovelties. Bayfield found the complex instruments objectionable because\r\neven \"the most trifling degree of injury is generally sufficient to render\r\nthe whole apparatus useless.\"[136]\r\n\r\nThe Smithsonian collection contains two patent models of American wet\r\ncupping devices. The first is an ingenious cupping set patented by a\r\nPhiladelphia navy surgeon, Robert J. Dodd, in 1844. It consisted of a\r\nmetal syringe provided with a plate of lancets that screwed on to a glass\r\ntube with a protuberance for collecting blood. The most interesting\r\nfeature of the apparatus was the provision made for cupping internal parts\r\nof the body such as the vagina, throat, or rectum. One could attach to the\r\npump either a curved or a straight tapering glass tube, seven to eight\r\ninches long, and corresponding flexible metal lancet rod. The pump could\r\nalso be adapted for extracting milk from the breasts of women by attaching\r\na metal cap with a hole just large enough to accommodate the nipple.[137]\r\nThe second patent model is that of W. D. Hooper of Liberty, Virginia, who\r\ninvented in 1867 an apparatus combining cup, pump, and scarificator. The\r\nnovel part of the instrument was the tubular blades that were injected\r\ninto the flesh and then left in place while the blood was being removed,\r\n\"by which means the punctures are kept from being closed prematurely, as\r\nfrequently happens with the ordinary device.\"[138]\r\n\r\nIt is unlikely that any of these ingenious devices were marketed in\r\nquantity. For those skilled in the art of cupping, the torch, cups, and\r\nscarificator were more effective. For those not experienced in the art,\r\nthe new devices were simply too expensive, inconvenient to carry about,\r\nand fragile. While doubtless some surgeons bought fancy equipment in order\r\nto impress their patients, other surgeons, and the professional cuppers,\r\nrealized that expensive and unfamiliar gadgets could inspire more dread\r\nthan awe, especially among rural patients. The cupper Monson Hills advised\r\nhis readers:\r\n\r\n     A person about to be cupped, is often needlessly alarmed by the\r\n     arrival of his operator, with a capacious box of instruments; and he\r\n     measures the severity of the pain he is about to undergo, by the\r\n     seeming multitude of instruments required to inflect it. If, on the\r\n     contrary, the few implements used are carried in the pocket, and\r\n     produced when about to be used, unobserved by the patient, this evil\r\n     is easily avoided.[139]\r\n\r\nIn seconding Hills' sentiments, W. A. Gillespie, the Virginia country\r\nphysician mentioned earlier, went a step further. Gillespie felt that the\r\nrural physician could dispense with the glass cups, torch, and\r\nscarificator and substitute in their place a simple thumb lancet and cow's\r\nhorn. Not only would these instruments save money, but they would also\r\n\"excite less dread in the mind of the patient than a formidable display of\r\nnumerous and complicated instruments.\"[140]\r\n\r\nSome inventors concentrated on more modest improvements in cupping\r\ntechnology, namely, modification of cups and scarificators. One of the\r\nsimplest improvements was that of Dr. Francis Fox, House Surgeon to the\r\nDerbyshire General Dispensary. In 1827, Dr. Fox introduced a new glass cup\r\nwith a short, curved, wide neck and an oval belly that hung downwards.\r\nWhen applied to the skin, the glass hung in the manner of a leech, and so\r\nthe glass was called \"The Glass Leech.\" Since the burning tow could be\r\nplaced in the hanging belly of the glass, away from the skin, it was\r\neasier to apply and remove the ordinary cup.[141] Other modifications of\r\nthe cupping cup included the addition of a stopcock to let the air back\r\nin, graduations to measure the blood, and the attachment of a metal bar\r\ninside the cup in order to hold the burning sponge or wick away from the\r\nbody of the patient.[142] (Figure 15.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 14.--Weiss's improved patent cupping apparatus.\r\nIllustrated are Weiss's patent syringe applied to cupping and Weiss's\r\nimproved scarificator. (From John Weiss, _Surgical Instruments_, 2nd\r\nedition, London, 1831. SI photo 73-5184.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most significant innovation in cups came with the manufacture of cups\r\nof vulcanized rubber in the 1840s. Rubber cups could be easily exhausted\r\nwithout need of a torch, and they were far cheaper and easier to\r\nmanipulate than cups attached to a pump. Most surgical catalogs in the\r\nlate nineteenth century offered both all-rubber cups and glass cups to\r\nwhich a rubber bulb was attached. In the late nineteenth century, sets of\r\ncups were sometimes sold with rubber rims because the rubber fit more\r\ncomfortably against the skin and prevented air from entering the cup.\r\nMuseum collections contain few rubber cups because nineteenth-century\r\nrubber tended to deteriorate in time. However, the appearance of these\r\ncups in all surgical catalogs indicates that they were widely sold.[143]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 15.--Fox's glass leech. Cupping set contains two\r\nhanging \"glass leeches,\" a scarificator, a bottle of alcohol, and a torch\r\nwith a ring handle such as the cupper Knox recommended. (Set held by the\r\nAcademy of Medicine, Toronto. Photo courtesy of the Academy.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral inventors tried to improve upon the scarificator. The defects of\r\nthe ordinary scarificator were widely recognized. It was too bulky and\r\nheavy, and it cost too much--the most inexpensive scarificator offered by\r\nGeorge Tiemann & Co. in 1889 cost $4.50.[144] A strong hand was required\r\nto trigger the blades, and when the trigger was released, the force of the\r\nspring was so great that the lever moved back with great force and\r\nproduced a loud, unpleasant click. The force of the lever moving against\r\nthe case of the scarificator made it impossible to use any but expensive\r\nmaterials (brass and German silver) in making the scarificator casing.\r\nFurthermore, the springs were liable to break. Finally, the scarificator\r\nwas difficult to clean.[145] Late in the century, when sterilization\r\nbecame important, some cuppers went back to the lancet because the\r\nscarificator could not be surgically cleansed. The surprising thing is,\r\nthat despite all the defects, the same scarificator was sold in 1930 as in\r\n1830. Either the claims of the inventors of improved scarificators were\r\nunjustified, or cuppers were unwilling to try novel instruments in what\r\nwas becoming an old-fashioned and increasingly less popular operation.\r\n(Figure 16.)\r\n\r\nA few British and American surgical supply companies sold special models\r\nof scarificator, but always in addition to the common scarificator. The\r\nspecial models were generally higher in price. For example, the\r\nEnglishman, James Coxeter, announced in 1845 a new scarificator with a\r\nrotating lever on the side instead of a cocking lever on the top. The\r\nroto-lever, according to Coxeter, could be turned to set the scarificator\r\nby a child of six. Furthermore, the scarificator was so constructed that\r\nwhen the spring was released only internal parts moved. There was no lever\r\nthat snapped back and no resounding click. This special model of\r\nscarificator continued to be sold by Coxeter and Son (London) until late\r\nin the nineteenth century.[146]\r\n\r\nCoxeter did not patent the roto-lever scarificator. In fact, through 1852\r\nthere were no British patents on scarificators. In contrast, there were\r\neight French patents on scarificators before 1860.[147] Of these, the most\r\nimportant was the 1841 patent of Joseph-Frederic-Benoit Charriere\r\n(1803-1973), a Swiss-born cutler who founded a major surgical supply\r\ncompany in Paris. Charriere's octagonal scarificator substituted two flat\r\ncoiled springs (like watch springs) for the two cantilever springs\r\nnormally found in \"reversible\" scarificators. One end of each coiled\r\nspring was attached to the scarificator casing and the other to one of the\r\nsupport rods. As the cocking lever was pulled, the support rods turned and\r\nwound the springs more tightly about the rods. According to Charriere,\r\nthese springs were more efficient and less likely to break than the\r\nordinary springs.[148]\r\n\r\nCharriere's company later employed the coiled springs in the making of a\r\ncircular scarificator. The circular scarificators, associated particularly\r\nwith French manufacture, were the most elegant of nineteenth-century\r\nscarificators and a fitting complement to the Charriere cupping sets.[149]\r\nThey were generally not sold by British and American surgical supply\r\ncompanies, but a number of them appear to have reached the hands of\r\nAmerican physicians.\r\n\r\nIn America, there were five patents on scarificators, of which the\r\nSmithsonian possesses three patent models. The most significant American\r\npatent was that of George Tiemann in 1846. Tiemann's scarificator had a\r\nflattened base and an ebony handle, which contained a coiled spring. The\r\nblades were moved by a rack and pinion mechanism, and triggered by a knob\r\nat the end of the handle. The advantages claimed by the inventor were ease\r\nin handling, ease in cleaning, and the diagonal cut of the blades that\r\nallowed the blood to flow more freely and the wounds to heal more readily.\r\nTiemann & Co. was still selling their patent scarificator as late as 1889\r\nfor a price of $7.00.[150] The Smithsonian possesses a marketed version in\r\naddition to the patent model.\r\n\r\nThe two other patent scarificators in the Smithsonian collection were both\r\ninvented by Frederick M. Leypoldt of Philadelphia. The first, patented in\r\n1847, was similar in external appearance to the common scarificator. The\r\nnovelty consisted of a new arrangement of the cocking lever and cantilever\r\nspring that allowed use of a lighter and cheaper casing. Although the\r\npatent model was made of brass, Leypoldt claimed that with his\r\nimprovements in the internal mechanism, the case could, with safety, be\r\nmade of tin.[151]\r\n\r\nLeypoldt's second patent, issued in 1851, was for a scarificator with a\r\ngreatly simplified inner mechanism allowing for a substantially smaller\r\nand lighter case. The cocking lever was placed horizontally in the casing\r\nand engaged the blade rods through a rack and pinion mechanism. According\r\nto Leypoldt, this scarificator was more convenient, more portable,\r\ncheaper, safer, and more reliable than the common scarificator.[152]\r\nLeypoldt probably marketed his scarificators, there being in the\r\nSmithsonian collection other bloodletting instruments with his name, but\r\nhe did not form a major surgical supply company as did George Tiemann.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 16.--Advertisement for phlebotomy and cupping\r\ninstruments. Note the rubber cups. (From George Tiemann & Co., _American\r\nArmamentarium Chirurgicum_, New York, 1889. SI photo 76-13542.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter 1860, interest in inventing new scarificators declined as wet\r\ncupping decreased in popularity. The improved cups and scarificators,\r\nwhile they had achieved a limited success, had still failed to supplant\r\nthe common octagonal scarificator and the plain glass cup. As interest in\r\nwet cupping declined, medical attention shifted to the therapeutic virtues\r\nof dry cupping. Dry cupping offered even greater opportunities for\r\ninventors, who sought means to bring the effects of the vacuum to more\r\nareas of the body for greater lengths of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dry Cupping_\r\n\r\nDry cupping, in its simplest form, was said to act as a \"revulsive\" or\r\n\"derivant.\" By the nineteenth century these once hotly debated terms had\r\nbecome nearly interchangeable in discussions of cupping. In cupping for\r\nrevulsive purposes, one cupped on a distant part to relieve excess of\r\nblood in the affected part. In applying cupping as a \"derivant,\" one\r\ncupped closer to the affected part. In either case, the source of pain was\r\npresumed to be somewhere below the skin, and the pain was relieved by\r\nbringing blood away from the affected part to the surface of the body.\r\nThus, one nineteenth-century cupper concluded, revulsion was only\r\nderivation at a distant point.[153]\r\n\r\nIf dry cupping was applied for ten minutes or longer so that the\r\ncapillaries burst, the action of the cups was said to be that of a\r\ncounter-irritant. According to ancient medical theory, the\r\ncounter-irritant was a means of relieving an affected part by deliberately\r\nsetting up a secondary inflammation or a running sore in another part.\r\nCounter-irritations were traditionally produced in a number of ways, among\r\nthem, blisters, cautery, setons, moxa, and dry cupping.[154]\r\n\r\nOne of the most popular counter-irritation devices commonly associated\r\nwith cupping instruments in catalogs of surgical goods, was Baunscheidt's\r\n_Lebenswecker_, sold by most American surgical supply houses in the second\r\nhalf of the nineteenth century. The _Lebenswecker_, or \"Awakener of Life,\"\r\nwas the mainstay of the mystical medical system known as\r\n_Baunscheidtismus_, after the founder of the device, Carl Baunscheidt of\r\nPrussia (1809-1860).[155] The system apparently gained much notoriety in\r\nGermany, England, and America, for Baunscheidt's book went through ten\r\nGerman editions and several British and American editions. At least two\r\nAmericans patented improvements on the _Lebenswecker_.[156] The device was\r\nmade of ebony, about 250 mm long, and contained a coiled spring attached\r\nto a handle. At the other end of the spring was a place about 20 mm in\r\ndiameter, with about thirty projecting needles. By pushing upon the\r\nhandle, one sent the needles into the skin. The ability of the instrument\r\nto create blisters was enhanced by the application of Baunscheidt's\r\nspecial oil to the irritation (Figure 17).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 17.--Venus and Adonis with marks showing where\r\nBaunscheidt's _Lebenswecker_ should be applied. (From Carl Baunscheidt,\r\n_Baunscheidtismus, by the Inventor of the New Curing Method_, Bonn,\r\n1859(?). Photo courtesy of NLM.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nDry cupping stimulated much theoretical debate in the nineteenth century\r\nas well as a number of physiological experiments.[157] Although physicians\r\ngenerally agreed that dry cupping had curative value if employed properly,\r\nthey disagreed widely on when to employ the remedy, and on the manner in\r\nwhich the remedy operated. Did application of cups affect only the surface\r\nvessels, or could cupping affect the entire nervous system, and through\r\nthe nerves, the action of the secretory organs? Were the effects of dry\r\ncupping of only a temporary nature, or were they permanent? An interesting\r\nseries of investigations in Europe and America sought to ascertain the\r\nvalue of dry cupping in checking the absorption of poison. An American,\r\nDr. Casper Wistar Pennock, replying to investigations performed by Martin\r\nBarry, an Edinburgh physician residing in Paris, carried out an impressive\r\nseries of physiological experiments in 1827, in which he administered\r\nstrychnine and arsenic under the skin of dogs and rabbits and then cupped\r\nover the wounds. He concluded that while dry cupping prevented almost\r\ncertain death from the poisons, once the cups were removed, death would\r\nensue, unless the poisons were surgically removed.[158]\r\n\r\nInterest in dry cupping led to attempts to apply the therapeutic effects\r\nof the operation to larger areas of the body than could be accommodated by\r\na cup. In France, Victor-Theodore Junod (1809-1881) adapted cupping to\r\nentire limbs. Shortly after receiving his degree in medicine in 1833,\r\nJunod presented at the Academy of Sciences his apparatus, known thereafter\r\nas Junod's boot. Junod believed that actual extraction of blood was a\r\ndangerous remedy and that the benefits of bleeding might as easily be\r\nobtained by his \"derivative method,\" which withdrew blood from the general\r\ncirculation but allowed it to be returned at will. Junod's boot and\r\nJunod's arm, which sold for as much as $25.00 apiece,[159] were\r\nconstructed of metal and secured against the limb by a silk, and later a\r\nrubber, cap. To the boot was attached a flexible tube, stopcock, pump, and\r\nif desired, a manometer for measuring the vacuum produced. In chronic\r\nillnesses, Junod recommended that the boot be applied for an hour. So much\r\nblood was withdrawn from the circulation by use of the apparatus that the\r\npatient might easily faint. To explain how his boot worked, Junod invented\r\na theory that he called \"hemospasia,\" meaning the drawing of blood.[160]\r\nThis was typical of a number of attempts to introduce sophisticated\r\nterminology into discussions of traditional remedies. Junod's arm and boot\r\nwere widely available through American surgical supply companies. As late\r\nas 1915, Heinrich Stern, previously mentioned as a latter-day proponent of\r\nbloodletting, had no doubt that application of the boot to the foot would\r\nrelieve congested states of the abdominal viscera.[161] (Figure 18.)\r\n\r\nAmericans patented a number of modifications of the arm and boot, and in\r\naddition they patented a number of whole body devices called \"depurators.\"\r\nJunod had introduced such a device along with his boot--a metal casing in\r\nwhich a patient would be placed leaving only his face showing. The air\r\ninside would then be exhausted by means of a gigantic syringe. In America\r\nsuch \"depurators\" may have been regarded more as quackery than as a\r\nlegitimate extension of cupping, for despite the fact that Americans\r\npatented some twenty of these devices, surgical supply houses did not sell\r\nthem and little was written about them.\r\n\r\nIn the last decade of the nineteenth century, Dr. August Bier, professor\r\nat the University of Bonn, developed another sophisticated theory\r\nsupporting the use of blood-suction devices, known as the theory of\r\nhyperemia, meaning \"excess of blood.\" According to the doctrine, lesions\r\nare always accompanied in nature by hyperemia, \"the most widespread of\r\nauto-curative agents.\"[162] If we, therefore, wish to imitate nature, we\r\ncreate an artificial hyperemia. Bier recommended several means of\r\nincreasing the blood supply of an affected part, including hot-air baths,\r\nsuction devices such as Junod's boot, and dry cupping. Several American\r\nsurgical suppliers sold Bier's Hyperemic Cups in the early twentieth\r\ncentury. These were glass cups, of a great variety of shapes and sizes\r\nincluding some with curved rims, each fitted with a rubber tube and bulb\r\nfor exhausting the air. A major function of these cups was to collect\r\nwound secretions from boils or furuncles.[163]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 18.--Junod's boot applied to a baby in the cradle.\r\n(From Victor Theodore Junod, _A Theoretical and Practical Treatise on\r\nMaemespasia_. London, 1879. Photo courtesy of NLM.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Breast Cupping_\r\n\r\nRelated to cupping by its technology is the practice of drawing milk from\r\nthe breasts by means of breast pumps. Mothers with underdeveloped or\r\ninflamed breasts posed a frequent problem for the nineteenth-century\r\nphysician, who treated them with either large doses of tartar emetic, a\r\nstrong purgative, or with cupping.[164] Breast pumps were small glass cups\r\nwith fluted edges made to accommodate the nipple. While some surgeons, as\r\nthe American Samuel Gross, recommended using a bottle with a long neck in\r\nwhich the air had been rarified by means of hot water,[165] most breast\r\npumps were exhausted by mechanical means. For reasons of modesty, the\r\npumps were usually designed so that the woman could draw her breasts\r\nherself. Perhaps the simplest design of a breast pump was a glass cup\r\nhaving a long spout extending in such a way that the woman could perform\r\nsuction herself. Such all-glass cups were illustrated in the eighteenth\r\ncentury.[166] A few, reputedly made centuries earlier, are found in the\r\nWellcome Historical Medical Museum. Early in the nineteenth century,\r\nbreast pumps, just as glass cups for bleeding, were attached to brass\r\nsyringes, and were often included among the variety of cups in cupping\r\nsets provided with syringes. Read's and Weiss's patent syringe as well as\r\nThomas Machell's cupping device were adapted for breast pumping. With the\r\ninvention of vulcanized rubber, the breast pump was frequently attached to\r\na large rubber bulb. A glass protuberance was often added to pumps\r\nexhausted by syringes or rubber bulbs, in order to collect the milk so\r\nthat it could be fed to the infant. In the 1920s some breast pumps were\r\nattached to electric motors.[167] Breast pumps have continued to be\r\nemployed up to the present day. Of all instruments employing the principle\r\nof the cupping device, breast pumps were the most frequently patented.\r\nFrom 1834 to 1975, more than 60 breast pumps were patented, the majority\r\nin the period from 1860 to 1920.[168]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Decline of Cupping_\r\n\r\nCupping died out in America in the early twentieth century, but its\r\ndisappearance was gradual and scarcely noticed. Some of the most complex\r\nof cupping devices were invented in a period when most physicians regarded\r\ncupping as ineffectual. Patents for cupping devices continued to be issued\r\nas late as 1916 when Joel A. Maxam of Idaho Springs, Colorado, patented a\r\nmotorized pump, which by means of various sizes of cups, could subject a\r\npart of the patient's body to either a prolonged suction or a prolonged\r\ncompression.[169] One of America's last advocates of bloodletting,\r\nHeinrich Stern, writing in 1915, also advocated the use of an electrical\r\nsuction pump to evacuate cups. With an electric motor, he declared, one\r\ncould prolong hyperemia for 15, 30, or more minutes.\r\n\r\nStern also invented a theory to account for the therapeutic effects of his\r\ninventions, namely, the theory of phlebostasis. Instead of pumping air out\r\nof a device, Stern pumped air into a device, for the same purpose of\r\nremoving a portion of blood from the general circulation. His\r\n\"phlebostate,\" manufactured by Kny-Scheerer of New York, was quite similar\r\nto a sphygmomanometer. It consisted of a set of cuffs that fit about the\r\nthighs, rubber tubes, a manometer, and a suction bulb or an electric force\r\npump. For stubborn cases, such as migraine headaches, Stern recommended\r\nusing the cuffs for 30 minutes or more. To facilitate the application of\r\nthe cuffs, Stern invented a \"phlebostasis chair,\" one of the most complex\r\n\"cupping\" devices ever made. Like an electric chair, the phlebostasis\r\nchair was supplied with cuffs for both arms and legs. Air was pumped into\r\nthe cuffs by means of an electric motor. According to Stern, compression\r\nof the upper segment of both arms withheld 300 cc of blood from\r\ncirculation, while compression of the thighs withheld as much as 600\r\ncc.[170]\r\n\r\nIn addition to these sophisticated devices, simple cupping, especially dry\r\ncupping, continued well into the 1930s. Although cupping was no longer\r\ngenerally recommended by physicians, most surgical companies advertised\r\ncups, scarificators, and cupping sets in the 1920s and even the 1930s. The\r\nlast bastions of cupping in the United States were the immigrant sections\r\nof large cities. In the lower East Side of New York, in particular,\r\ncupping was still flourishing in the 1920s. By then cupping was no longer\r\nperformed by the physician, but had been relegated back to the lowly\r\nbarber, who advertised in his shop window, \"Cups for Colds.\"[171]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLeeching\r\n\r\n\r\n_Leeches_\r\n\r\nThe word \"leech\" derives from the Anglo-Saxon _loece_, \"to heal.\" Thus,\r\nthe Anglo-Saxon physician was called a \"leech\" and his textbook of\r\ntherapeutic methods a \"leechdom.\" The animal itself was already known to\r\nthe ancients under its Latin name _hirudino_. It appears, however, that\r\nthe introduction of leeches into Western medicine came somewhat later than\r\nthat of phlebotomy or cupping, for Hippocrates made no mention of them.\r\nThe earliest references to the use of leeches in medicine are found in\r\nNicander of Colophon (2nd century B.C.) and in Themison (1st century\r\nB.C.). Thereafter they were mentioned by most Greek, Roman, and Arabic\r\nmedical writers.[172]\r\n\r\nThe leech is a fresh-water parasitic invertebrate belonging to the Phylum\r\nAnnelida. On one end of its worm-like body is a large sucker by which the\r\nanimal fastens itself to the ground, and at the other end is a smaller\r\nsucker, in the middle of which is a chitinous mouth that makes a\r\ntriangular puncture. As items of _materia medica_, leeches were described\r\nin dispensatories, or compilations of medicaments, and sold by\r\napothecaries, both to physicians and directly to patients. The species\r\nmost commonly used for bleeding was _Hirudo medicinalis_, indigenous to\r\nthe streams and swamps of Central and Northern Europe, and known in\r\ncommerce as the Swedish or German leech. It was 50-75 mm long, with a dull\r\nolive green back and four yellow longitudinal lines, the central two\r\nbroken with black. Somewhat less popular was the Hungarian leech,\r\nindigenous to Southern Europe. In addition, there was an American species\r\nof leech, _Hirudo decora_, which was gathered principally from the lower\r\nDelaware River, but, since it drew much less blood than the Swedish leech,\r\nit was regarded as greatly inferior.[173] Most American physicians\r\nimported their leeches. In the late nineteenth century, one could buy\r\nSwedish leeches for $5.00 per hundred.[174]\r\n\r\nLeeches were gathered in the spring of the year either by means of a pole\r\nnet, or, more primitively, by wading into the water and allowing the\r\nleeches to fasten themselves onto the legs. Sometimes horses and cattle\r\nwere driven into the water to serve as bait for the leeches.[175] (Figure\r\n19.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 19.--Lithograph published in London in 1814 showing\r\nthree women gathering leeches by a stream. (NMHT 320033.08; SI photo\r\n76-7741.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nLeeching, like other forms of bloodletting, enjoyed a revival in the early\r\nnineteenth century, particularly in France, where the doctrines of heroic\r\nmedicine preached by Broussais[176] led to an increase of leech usage from\r\nabout 3 million in 1824 to 41.5 million in 1833.[177] Leechers, although\r\nnot as high in status as professional cuppers, practiced in many large\r\ncities, and numerous tracts were written on the care and breeding of\r\nleeches. \"Leech farms\" were unable to increase the leech supply to meet\r\nthe rising demand, and most leechers complained of the scarcity and great\r\nexpense of the little animals.[178]\r\n\r\nLeeching and cupping each had their advocates. The major advantage of the\r\nleech over the cup was that the leech could be employed on almost any part\r\nof the anatomy, including around the eyes, in the mouth, the anus, and the\r\nvagina. In fact, leeching the internal membranes enjoyed quite a vogue in\r\nthe early nineteenth century. Leeches were applied to the larynx and the\r\ntrachea for bronchitis and laryngitis and for relieving the cough of\r\nphthisis. For inflammations of the conjunctiva (the membrane lining the\r\neyelids) they were applied to the nasal membrances of the adjacent\r\nnostril, and for inflammations of the ear they were applied to the meatus\r\nof the ear and behind the ear. The French popularized the practice of\r\nleeching the anus to treat inflammations of the mucous membranes of the\r\nbowel. To prevent leeches from getting lost in the body cavities, Jonathan\r\nOsborne, a British physician, recommended in 1833 that a thread should be\r\npassed through the leech's tail. In addition, he invented a device, which\r\nhe called a \"polytome,\" specifically for introducing leeches into the\r\nrectum.[179] In the mid-nineteenth century, special leech tubes were\r\nwidely sold for applying leeches to internal membranes.[180]\r\n\r\nA second advantage of leeches over cupping was that leeches could extract\r\nblood more readily. Not only was dexterity not required in order to apply\r\na leech, but also it was soon noticed that leech bites continued to bleed\r\neven after the leech let go, while scarificator incisions often coagulated\r\nbefore any blood was obtained. In 1884 it was shown by John Berry\r\nHaycroft, a Birmingham chemist, that this phenomenon was due to an\r\nanti-coagulant, now called \"hirudin,\" that the leech injected into the\r\nblood.[181]\r\n\r\nTo apply a leech, the animal was first dried with a bit of linen, and the\r\nskin of the patient was prepared by washing with warm water and then\r\nshaving. To direct it to the right spot, the leech was often placed in a\r\nsmall wine glass that was inverted over the area to be bitten. Since\r\nleeches were sometimes perversely unwilling to bite, they were enticed by\r\nthe placement of a bit of milk or blood on the patient's skin. Small\r\nchildren were given one or two leeches, and adults 20 or more. Broussais\r\nemployed up to 50 leeches at one time.[182] The leech was usually allowed\r\nto drop off of its own accord when it had satiated itself, which took\r\nabout an hour. Sometimes the tail of the leech was cut off so that it\r\nwould continue to suck. Once used, leeches could not be reused for several\r\nmonths unless they were made to disgorge their meal by dropping them in\r\nsalt water or weak vinegar. A healthy leech drew one or two fluid drachms\r\nof blood, and as much would flow after the leech had dropped off. Thus a\r\ngood Swedish leech could remove about an ounce of blood. This quantity\r\ncould be increased by employing a cupping glass over the bite.[183]\r\n\r\nLeeches were kept in a glass container of water covered with gauze or\r\nmuslin and placed in a cool, dark room. The water had to be changed\r\nfrequently, as much as every other day in summer. Pebbles or moss were\r\nplaced in the bottom of the vessel to aid the leech in removing the slimy\r\nepidermis that it shed every four or five days. In the nineteenth century\r\nleeches were often sold in drug stores from large, elegant containers with\r\nperforated caps. Actually, only the day's supply of the pharmacist's\r\nleeches was kept in the attractive storefront jars; the rest were kept out\r\nof sight. While most leech jars were simple white crockery pieces with\r\n\"leeches\" lettered in black on the front, some leech jars were over two\r\nfeet tall and decorated with elegant floral and scroll work. Among the\r\nmost ornate leech jars were those made in Staffordshire, England.[184]\r\n(Figure 20.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Artificial Leeches_\r\n\r\nOne of the characteristics of nineteenth-century technology was the\r\nattempt to replace natural materials and processes by imitations and\r\nmechanisms. Considering the properties of the natural leech, it is no\r\nwonder that very early in the nineteenth century inventors began to seek a\r\nmechanical substitute. The disadvantages of the leech were many. Wrote\r\none inventor of an artificial leech:\r\n\r\n     In the first place the appearance of the animal is repulsive and\r\n     disgusting, and delicate and sensitive persons find it difficult to\r\n     overcome their repugnance to contact with the cold and slimy reptile.\r\n     This is especially the case when it is a question of their\r\n     application about or within the mouth. Then again, their disposition\r\n     to crawl into cavities or passages results sometimes in very annoying\r\n     accidents. Another source of annoyance is that they are often\r\n     unwilling to bite--the patience of all concerned being exhausted in\r\n     fruitless efforts to induce them to take hold.\r\n\r\n     The expense, too, of a considerable number is by no means\r\n     trifling.[185]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 20.--Staffordshire leech jars, 19th century. (NMHT\r\n263554 [M-11504]; SI photo 73-4231.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition, leeches were often difficult to obtain, and the rural\r\nphysician could not easily carry them about. Leech bites could have\r\nunfortunate consequences, for many times the bleeding could not be\r\nstopped. For these and other reasons, several inventors in Europe and\r\nAmerica sought to create a mechanical or artificial leech.[186] Such\r\nartificial leeches are often difficult to distinguish from cupping\r\ndevices, because both sorts of instruments employed some form of\r\nscarification and suction. Artificial leeches however, were usually\r\nadaptable to small areas of the anatomy, and the puncture wound generally\r\nattempted to imitate a leech bite.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the earliest instrument offered as a substitute for leeches was\r\nSarlandiere's \"bdellometer,\" from the Greek _bdello_, \"leech.\"\r\nSarlandiere, a French manufacturer, introduced his instrument in 1819 and,\r\nincidentally, had the prototype sent to New Orleans. The bdellometer\r\nconsisted of a glass bell with two protruding tubes, one perpendicular for\r\nperforming scarification, and the other oblique, for attaching the\r\naspirating pump. A plug could be removed to allow air to enter the bell\r\nafter the operation was completed, and a faucet allowed for drainage of\r\nblood without having to remove the apparatus from the body. A curved\r\ncannula could be attached to the bdellometer for bleeding in the nasal\r\npassages, the mouth, the vagina, and the rectum. For internal\r\nbloodletting, the disk, with lancets, normally used for scarification, was\r\nreplaced by a small brush of hog bristles.[187] Sarlandiere's bdellometer\r\nattracted sufficient attention in America to be included in the numerous\r\neditions of Robley Dunglison's medical dictionary,[188] but it was\r\nultimately no more successful than the complicated cupping devices\r\ndiscussed in the previous chapter.\r\n\r\nA second French invention, also given a pretentious name, was Damoiseau's\r\n\"terabdella\" (meaning \"large leech\"), or pneumatic leech. This invention,\r\nintroduced some time before 1862, met with skepticism at the outset on the\r\npart of the reviewers at the French Academy of Medicine. It consisted of\r\ntwo pistons attached to a plate to be placed on the floor and held down by\r\nthe feet of the operator. Each piston was connected by a tube to a cup,\r\nand the whole apparatus was operated by means of a hand lever connected\r\nwith both pistons. More a cupping device than an artificial leech, the\r\nterabdella met with little success beyond the French province where\r\nDamoiseau practiced.[189] (Figure 21.)\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most successful of the mechanical leeches was known as\r\nHeurteloup's leech, after its inventor, the Frenchman, Charles Louis\r\nHeurteloup (1793-1864). Sold in most late nineteenth-century surgical\r\ncatalogs for as much as $15.00, the device consisted of two parts, one a\r\nspring scarificator that made a small circular incision (about 5 mm in\r\ndiameter) and the other, a suction pump, holding an ounce of blood, whose\r\npiston was raised by means of a screw. For the treatment of eye ailments,\r\none of the major purposes for which the device was invented, it was\r\napplied to the temples.[190] A similar two-part mechanical leech was sold\r\nunder the name \"Luer's Leech.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting leech substitutes, sold by George Teimann &\r\nCo. as its \"Patent Artificial Leech,\" employed ether in exhausting the\r\nglass \"leeches.\" Patented by F. A. Stohlmann and A. H. Smith of New York\r\nin 1870, the \"leech\" consisted of a glass tube, either straight or with a\r\nmouth on the side so that the tube would hang somewhat like a living\r\nleech. To expel air from the tube, a few drops of ether were placed in it,\r\nafter which it was immersed to its mouth in hot water until the ether\r\nvaporized. The tube was then applied to the skin and allowed to cool, thus\r\nsucking blood from a wound made by the scarificator, a long metal tube\r\nthat was rotated to make a circular incision. One of the patentees\r\nexplained the advantages of the device:\r\n\r\n     In all previous attempts at an artificial leech the vacuum has been\r\n     produced by the action of a piston. This renders the instrument too\r\n     heavy to retain its position, and necessitates its constantly being\r\n     held. This precludes the application of any number at once, even if\r\n     the cost of half-a-dozen such instruments were left out of the\r\n     account. But in the case of this leech, the tubes, being exceedingly\r\n     light, attach themselves at once, remaining in position until filled;\r\n     and as the cost of them is but a few cents, there is no limit to the\r\n     number which may be applied.[191]\r\n\r\nTo take the place of leeches in the uterus, quite a number of uterine\r\nscarificators were sold. These were generally simple puncturing\r\ninstruments without spring mechanisms. If insufficient blood flowed from\r\nthe scarification, Thomas's Dry Cupper, a widely available vulcanite\r\nsyringe, could be inserted into the vagina to cup the cervix before\r\npuncturing.[192] At least one attempt was made to combine puncture and\r\nsuction in a device for uterine application. This was Dr. William Reese's\r\n\"Uterine Leech,\" introduced in 1876. It consisted of a graduated glass\r\ncylinder 190 mm long and 12 mm in diameter containing a piston and a rod\r\nwith a spear point. The rod was surrounded by a spring that withdrew the\r\nblade after it punctured the cervix. Several American companies, including\r\nGeorge Tiemann & Co., offered the device for sale.[193]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 21.--Damoiseau's terabdella. (From Damoiseau, _La\r\nTerabdelle ou machine pneumatique_, Paris, 1862. Photo courtesy of NLM.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite all the efforts to find a suitable substitute, the use of natural\r\nleeches persisted until the practice of local bloodletting gradually\r\ndisappeared in America. By the 1920s leeches were difficult to find except\r\nin pharmacies in immigrant sections of large cities like New York or\r\nBoston. One of the last ailments to be regularly treated by leeches was\r\nthe common black eye. Leeches commanded rather high prices in the 1920s,\r\nif they could be found at all. One Brooklyn pharmacist, who deliberately\r\nkept an old-fashioned drugstore with the motto \"No Cigars, No Candy, No\r\nIce Cream, No Soda Water, But I Do Sell Pure Medicines,\" wrote in 1923:\r\n\r\n     Here in this atmosphere free from the lunch room odor my\r\n     armamentarium consists of drugs and preparations from the vegetable,\r\n     mineral and animal kingdoms. Among the latter are leeches,\r\n     prominently displayed in a number of glass jars in different parts of\r\n     the store, including one in the show window. Anything moving,\r\n     anything odd, arouses the curiosity of the public, and my reputation\r\n     as a \"leecher\" has spread far beyond the \"City of Churches.\" Besides,\r\n     this leech business is also profitable, as they are retailed at $1.00\r\n     per head without any trouble; in fact patients are only too glad to\r\n     be able to obtain them.[194]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVeterinary Bloodletting\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same theories and practices that prevailed for human medicine were\r\napplied to the treatment of animals. Not only were horses routinely bled,\r\nthey were also cupped and leeched.[195] Manuals of veterinary medicine\r\ngave instructions for the bleeding of horses, cows, sheep, pigs, dogs, and\r\ncats.[196]\r\n\r\nThere was one major difference between bleeding a man and bleeding a horse\r\nor cow, and that was the amount of strength required to open a vein. The\r\nconsiderable force needed to pierce the skin and the tunic of the blood\r\nvessel made the operation much more difficult to perform than human\r\nphlebotomy.[197] As in the case of cupping, the simplest instruments,\r\nthose most often recommended by experts, were not easy to use by those\r\nwithout experience. Although a larger version of the thumb lancet was\r\nsometimes employed, most veterinarians opened the vein of a horse with a\r\nfleam, that is, an instrument in which the blade (commonly double beveled)\r\nwas set at right angles to the blade stem. These are enlarged versions of\r\nthe fleam employed in human bloodletting. The fleams sold in the\r\neighteenth and nineteenth centuries consisted of one or more blades that\r\nfolded out of a fitted brass shield. In the late nineteenth century fleams\r\nwith horn shields were also sold. The largest blades were to be used to\r\nopen the deeper veins and the smaller blades to open the more superficial\r\nveins.\r\n\r\nTo force the fleam into the vein, one employed a bloodstick, a stick 35-38\r\ncm long and 2 cm in diameter. The blade was held against the vein and a\r\nblow was given to the back of the blade with the stick in such a way that\r\nthe fleam penetrated but did not go through the vein. Immediately the\r\nfleam was removed and a jet of blood came forth that was caught and\r\nmeasured in a container. When enough blood had been collected, a needle\r\nwould be placed in the vein to stop the bleeding.\r\n\r\nHorses were most frequently bled from the jugular vein in the neck, but\r\nalso from veins in the thigh, the fold at the junction of breast and\r\nforelegs, the spur, the foreleg, the palate, and the toe.\r\n\r\nSince applying the bloodstick required a degree of skill, the Germans\r\nattempted to eliminate its use by adapting the spring lancet to veterinary\r\nmedicine. The common veterinary spring lancet (which sometimes was also\r\ncalled a \"fleam\" or \"phleme\") was nothing but an oversized version of the\r\nbrass, nob end spring lancet used on humans. Sometimes the lancet was\r\nprovided with a blade guard that served to regulate the amount of blade\r\nthat penetrated the skin. Although the veterinary spring lancet was quite\r\npopular in some quarters, the French preferred the simple foldout fleam as\r\na more convenient instrument.[198] (Figure 22.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 22.--Knob end spring lancet used on humans compared\r\nto a knob end lancet used on horses and cattle. Note the blade guard on\r\nthe veterinary spring lancet. (NMHT 302606.09 and NMHT 218383 [M-9256]: SI\r\nphoto 76-7757.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the few attempts made to modify the human spring lancet,\r\nthere were a large number of attempts to modify the veterinary spring\r\nlancets. Veterinary spring lancets can be found with a wide assortment of\r\nshapes and a wide variety of spring mechanisms. In the enlarged knob end\r\nspring lancet, pushing upon the lever release simply sent the blade\r\nforward into the skin. By a more complex mechanism, the blade could be\r\nmade to return after it was injected, or the blade could be made to sweep\r\nout a curve as do the blades of the scarificator. Perhaps one of the\r\nearliest attempts to introduce a more complex internal mechanism into the\r\nveterinary spring lancets is found in John Weiss's \"patent horse phlemes\"\r\nof 1828. The first model invented by Weiss was constructed on the\r\nprinciple of the common fleam and bloodstick. As in the knob end spring\r\nlancet, the spring acted as a hammer to drive the blade forward. In a\r\nsecond improved \"horse phleme,\" Weiss mounted the blade on a pivot so that\r\nthe blade swept out a semicircle when the spring was released.[199]\r\n\r\nThe Smithsonian collection contains a number of different types of\r\nveterinary spring lancets. Perhaps this variety can best be illustrated by\r\nlooking at the two patent models in the collection. The first is an\r\noval-shaped lancet patented in 1849 by Joseph Ives of Bristol,\r\nConnecticut.[200] By using a wheel and axle mechanism, Ives had the blade\r\nsweep out an eccentric curve. The lancet was set by a detachable key\r\n(Figure 23).\r\n\r\nThe second patent lancet was even more singular in appearance, having the\r\nshape of a gun. This instrument, patented by Hermann Reinhold and August\r\nSchreiber of Davenport, Iowa, in 1880, featured a cocking lever that\r\nextended to form a coiled spring in the handle portion of the gun. Also\r\nattached to the cocking lever was an extended blade with ratchet catches,\r\nso that by pulling on the cocking lever, the blade was brought inside the\r\ncasing and the spring placed under tension. Pushing upon the trigger then\r\nshot the blade into the vein.[201] (Figure 24.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhysical Analysis of Artifacts\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Conservation Analytical Laboratory of the Smithsonian Institution\r\nanalyzed selected bloodletting instruments and one drawing from the\r\nMuseum's collection. Instruments were chosen on the basis of their unique\r\nappearance and as representative examples of the major types of\r\ninstruments in the collection. Six lancets and cases, two scarificators,\r\nand one pen and ink drawing were analyzed.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 23.--Patent model, J. Ives, 1849. (NMHT 89797\r\n[M-4292]: SI photo 73-4211.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 24.--Patent model, Reinhold and Schreiber, 1880.\r\n(NMHT 89797 [M-4327]; SI photo 73-4210.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nX-ray fluorescence analysis, response to a magnet, reaction to nitric\r\nacid, and the Vickers pyramid hardness test were among the methods of\r\nanalysis used that involved no damage to the objects.\r\n\r\nThe instrument for X-ray fluorescence analysis has been modified to permit\r\nanalysis of selected areas on the objects. This instrument produces,\r\ndetects, and records the object's X-ray fluorescence spectrum, which is\r\ncharacteristic of its composition. X-rays produced by a target in the\r\ninstrument strike the object and cause it, in turn, to fluoresce, or emit,\r\nX-rays. This fluorescence is detected by a silicon crystal in the detector\r\nand dispersed into a spectrum, which is displayed on an oscilloscope\r\nscreen. The entire spectrum--from 0 to 40 Ke V--can be displayed or\r\nportions of it can be expanded and displayed at an apparently higher\r\nresolution that permits differentiation between closely spaced fluorescent\r\npeaks, such as those from iron and manganese. The spectrum may be\r\ntransferred from the oscilloscope to a computer for calculation of the\r\npercentage of composition and for comparison with spectra of other\r\nsamples. During analysis the objects can be supported and masked by sheets\r\nof plexiglas or metal foils to limit the radiation to a certain area of\r\nthe object. Masks also prevent scattering of radiation off other parts of\r\nthe object and off the instrument itself, which otherwise might be\r\ndetected and interpreted as less concentrated components in the object.\r\n\r\nBrass was the most common metal used in the fabrication of eighteenth- and\r\nnineteenth-century lancets and scarificators. Upon analysis the brass was\r\nfound to contain 70%-75% copper, 20%-30% zinc, and other trace elements.\r\nThe blades, cocking levers, and button releases of lancets and\r\nscarificators were found to be made of ferrous metal (iron or steel). In\r\naddition to the typical brass pieces, a number of \"white metal\" pieces\r\nwere analyzed. (The term \"white metal\" is used to designate any\r\nundetermined silver-colored metal alloy.) Those white metal pieces dating\r\nfrom the eighteenth century (a Swiss or Tyrolean fleam and an English\r\nveterinary spring lancet) were found to be composed entirely of ferrous\r\nmetal. The hardness of the fleam metal indicated that it was carburized\r\nsufficiently to be made of steel. Two of the spring lancets, dating from\r\nthe late nineteenth century, were found to be made of a silver-copper\r\ncomposition that was not rich enough in silver to be sterling silver.\r\nThese lancets were probably typical of the lancets advertised as silver in\r\nthe late nineteenth-century trade catalogs. About 1850 an alloy imitating\r\nsilver began to be widely used in the making of surgical instruments. This\r\nwas German silver or nickel-silver, an alloy containing no silver at all,\r\nbut rather copper, zinc, and nickel. A patent model scarificator dating\r\nfrom 1851 was found to contain about 63% copper, 24% zinc, and 13% nickel.\r\nThis alloy is presently called \"nickel-silver 65-12\" alloy. The French\r\nmade scarificators out of their own version of nickel-silver that was\r\ncalled \"maillechort.\" The French circular scarificator was found to\r\ncontain copper (55%-70%), nickel (10%-20%), zinc (20%-30%), and tin (less\r\nthan 10%). The cases in which the lancets and scarificators were carried\r\nwere covered with leather, despite the fact that several appeared to be\r\ncovered with paper. X-ray analysis revealed that several cases contained\r\ntin, leading to the possibility that a tin salt was used in the\r\ndye-mordant for leather. The clasps on the cases were made of brass. One\r\ncase was trimmed in gold leaf.\r\n\r\nThe most difficult item to analyze was the pen and ink drawing in black\r\nand red of a bloodletting man purported to be a fifteenth-century specimen\r\n(1480) from South Germany. The text is in German (Figure 25).\r\n\r\nThe watermark of the paper--a horned bull (ox) with crown--is believed to\r\nhave appeared in 1310 and was used widely for two hundred years. The paper\r\nwas heavily sized and no feathering of the black ink or red paint appears.\r\n\r\nThe paper fluoresced only faintly under ultraviolet light and much less\r\nbrightly than new paper, leading to the conclusion that the paper is not\r\nmodern. Various stains on the paper fluoresce yellow, which also indicates\r\na considerable history for the document.\r\n\r\nThe guard strip is vellum. Red stains on this strip may have been made by\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nThe inks (brown and red) may have come from different sources or been\r\napplied at different times because of their various compositions and\r\ndensities. Iron and lead were found in an area of writing on the left\r\nfoot. Iron is typical of an iron gall ink. Some of the lighter lines\r\ncontain graphite. The red lines contain mercury and lead suggesting a\r\nmixture of vermilion and red lead.\r\n\r\nAnalysis of the ink and paper indicates that the document has had a varied\r\nhistory and seems not to have been a deliberate production intended to\r\nsimulate age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCatalog of Bloodletting Instruments\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral systems of catalog numbers have been employed for instruments in\r\nthe collections. The earliest instruments were originally collected by the\r\nDivision of Anthropology and were given a six-digit number in the division\r\ncatalog (referred to as \"Anthropology\"). Later objects in the collections\r\nhave been given a six-digit National Museum of History and Technology\r\n(NMHT) accession number, which serves for all items obtained from one\r\nsource at a given date. Before 1973, the Division of Medical Sciences used\r\na system of numbering individual items by M numbers (e.g., \"M-4151\").\r\nSince 1973, individual items have been distinguished by adding decimal\r\nnumbers to the accession numbers (e.g., \"308730.10\"). Objects on loan have\r\nbeen marked as such and given a six-digit number. Other institutional\r\nabbreviations are as follows: SI = Smithsonian Institution; USNM = the\r\nformer United States National Museum; NLM = National Library of Medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 25.--Bloodletting manikin. (NMHT 243033 [M-10288];\r\nSI photo 76-13536.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nPhotograph numbers are labeled \"BW\" for black and white negative and \"CS\"\r\nfor color slide.

Donated by Dr. A. J. Olmstead 1945.\r\nLancet: L 74 mm, W 38 mm. Case: L 133 mm, W 60 mm, H 33 mm. NMHT 171080\r\n(M-6418).\r\n\r\nSpring lancet, 19th century. Veterinary lancet similar to the previous\r\nlancet except that the blade is larger and provided with a blade guard.\r\nBlade guard can be set by a screw in order to regulate the size of the\r\nblade. Stamped on back panel is \"F. Leypoldt/Phila.\" This is presumably\r\nthe same Frederick Leypoldt who patented two scarificators, one in 1847\r\nand one in 1851. Donated by the University of Pennsylvania 1959. L 74 mm,\r\nW 34 mm. Neg. 76-7757 (BW, CS), compares lancet to one used in human\r\nphlebotomy, NMHT 218383 (M-9256). (Figure 22.)\r\n\r\nSpring lancet with case, 19th century. Brass knob end lancet with large\r\nblade and blade guard. Lancet has a rim around the top and a lever release\r\nmolded to resemble a torch. Case is lined with black plush and covered\r\nwith black cloth. Purchased 1976. Lancet: L 85 mm (not including blade), W\r\n40 mm. Case: L 142 mm, W 78 mm, H 39 mm. NMHT 316478.\r\n\r\nSpring lancet with case, 19th century. Instrument is made of brass and has\r\na ball-shaped handle. The blade is double beveled, typical of blades for\r\nveterinary bleeders. The ball handle contains a spring that is attached to\r\na small projecting cylinder with string tied to it. By pulling on the\r\nstring, one can pull the blade in, and by pushing a button one can inject\r\nthe blade. Case is made of wood covered with leather and is coffin-shaped.\r\nPurchased 1976. L 95 mm (to tip of blade), D of ball 34 mm. Neg. 76-7750\r\n(BW, CS). NMHT 321697.07. (Figure 104.)\r\n\r\nSpring lancet with case, 19th century. Lancet is brass and has a\r\ntriangular shape. It is triggered by a slide catch on the front of the\r\ninstrument. The triggering handle is a detachable piece that lifts off a\r\nsquare peg. Hinged from the side is a curved piece for ease in holding.\r\nScrew on front of the instrument probably regulates blade depth and a\r\nrectangular button at the top corner probably releases the blade.\r\nMechanism is jammed and the blade is hidden within the instrument. Only\r\nthe bottom half of the case remains. Purchase 1976. L 83 mm, W 59 mm. Neg.\r\n76-7756 (BW, CS). NMHT 321697.08. (Figure 119.)\r\n\r\nSpring lancet, late 18th-early 19th century. Triangular-shaped lancet made\r\nof brass and iron and decorated with a floral design. Blade (missing) is\r\nattached to an iron lever, which, when pulled back, is held in place by a\r\nlever with ratchets attached to the facing side of the instrument.\r\nPressing upon this same lever releases the ratchets and injects the blade.\r\nPurchased 1976. H 97 mm, W 80 mm. Neg. 76-7755 (BW, CS). NMHT 321697.09.\r\n(Figure 120.)\r\n\r\nSpring lancet with case, 18th century. This rather elegant lancet consists\r\nof a body and a detachable handle. According to analysis by the\r\nConservation Laboratory, the lancet is made of ferrous metal (iron or\r\nsteel). Blade is screwed into a curved lever. Pulling upon the handle\r\npulls back the lever with the blade, and releasing the handle releases the\r\nblade. Case is made of wood, covered with black leather and lined with\r\ngreen silk and green plush. Seller says that the lancet was made in\r\nEngland, ca. 1700. This date seems somewhat too early. Purchased 1976. H\r\n112 mm, W 72 mm (to tip of blade). Neg. 76-7753 (BW, CS). NMHT 321697.10.\r\n(Figure 121.)\r\n\r\nSpring lancet, 19th century. Instrument is made of brass and has an odd,\r\nirregularly curved shape. A large blade with a blade guard protrudes from\r\nthe side. Blade is triggered by an iron slide catch on the front of the\r\ninstrument and released by a brass lever release similar to that found in\r\nknob end lancets. Purchased 1976. L 138 mm, W 82 mm (to tip of blade).\r\nNeg. 76-7754 (BW, CS). NMHT 321697.11. (Figure 103.)\r\n\r\nSpring lancet, 19th century. Instrument is made of brass with steel\r\nscrews. It is inscribed on one side: \"Weiss improved bleeding instrument\r\n33 Strand London.\" There is a brass guard on the blade that can be moved\r\nalong the blade by a screw attached directly opposite the blade. It fits\r\ninto a red leather case with beige velvet lining. The case closes with two\r\nbrass hooks. Purchased 1976. Case: L 92 mm, W 75 mm. Height without lever\r\n66 mm, Width at widest point 64 mm, overall width 12 mm. Neg. 77-13961\r\n(BW, CS). NMHT 1977.0576.01. (Figure 122.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Related Artifacts_\r\n\r\nCounter-irritation device, patent model, 1860. Improved version of\r\nBaunscheidt's _Lebenswecker_ patented by Alfred Stauch of Philadelphia\r\n(U.S. patent no. 28697). Stauch added a brush around the needles and an\r\nadditional spring to force the needles back after they had entered the\r\nskin. The brush could be oiled before the operation, thus saving the need\r\nto oil the wound afterwards. The device is similar to the _Lebenswecker_\r\nin size and construction, except that it was made of a lighter colored\r\nwood and was trimmed in brass. Transferred from the U.S. Patent Office\r\n1926. L 245 mm, D 20 mm. Neg. 72-11290 (BW). NMHT 89797 (M-4299).\r\n\r\nCounter-irritation device, patent model, 1866. Patented by Friederich Klee\r\nof Williamsburg, New York (U.S. Patent 55775), this instrument is another\r\nmodification of Baunscheidt's _Lebenswecker_. It is made of wood and\r\nbrass, and is much shorter than the _Lebenswecker_ but operated in the\r\nsame manner. A screw on the handle served to regulate the length of the\r\nneedles. A further innovation was the addition of a diaphragm of leather\r\nthrough which the needles pass. The leather could be saturated with oil\r\nbefore the operation, thus again saving the need to apply oil afterwards.\r\nTransferred from the U.S. Patent Office 1926. L 92 mm. Neg. 72-11274. NMHT\r\n89797 (M-4305). (Figure 123.)\r\n\r\nBarber-surgeon's kit, late 18th-early 19th century.

Pen and ink drawing in black and red\r\ninks on a folded sheet of paper with the watermark \"Ochsenkapf mit Krone\"\r\nreportedly made in Southern Germany in 1480. The paper is backed at the\r\nfold by a piece of vellum. Drawing is of a man with astrological signs and\r\ninstructions in German in balloons pointing at 25 points of his body, of\r\nwhich 4 are symmetrical. Such a drawing used in conjunction with a dial\r\nwould be used to determine when and where to bleed. On the reverse are\r\nastronomical tables. According to analysis by the Conservation Laboratory\r\nat the Smithsonian, the paper might well date from the 15th century and\r\nthe ink has been applied at various times. Purchased 1962.

Carl\r\nBaunscheidt of Bonn exhibited his _Lebenswecker_ (\"Life Awakener\") at the\r\nGreat Exhibition in London in 1851. It consists of a long hollow tube made\r\nof ebony and containing a coiled spring attached to a handle. A cap\r\ncovers a plate with some thirty sharp needles. Pushing upon the handle\r\ninjects the needles into the skin. The devise was used with Baunscheidt's\r\nspecial oil, which was applied to the skin after the needles had irritated\r\nit. Donated by Grace Sutherland 1970. L 250 mm, W 30 mm. Neg. 76-7751\r\n(BW). NMHT 287885 (M-12936). (Figure 79.)\r\n\r\nBaunscheidt's _Lebenswecker_, mid 19th-early 20th century.

Congestion of blood vessels in a healthy person gives rise to a\r\nsympathetic irritation in the mucous surfaces of bodily orifices.\r\nEquilibrium may be restored naturally by hemorrhage through the nose.\r\nWithout this release of blood, congestion builds up into an inflammation.\r\nLocal bloodletting relieves the congestion when applied on a portion of\r\nthe skin corresponding to the inflamed organ. Broussais's favorite remedy\r\nwas the application of leeches to the stomach and head. For this purpose\r\nhe ordered hundreds of leeches daily. See F.J.V. BROUSSAIS, _A Treatise\r\non Physiology Applied & Pathology_, translated by John Bell and R. La\r\nRoche, 2nd American edition (Philadelphia, 1828), page 414, and\r\nCastiglioni, op. cit.

Requests for special treatment--use of\r\ncolor, foldouts, casebound covers, etc.--require, on the same form, the\r\nadded approval of designated committees or museum directors.\r\n\r\n=Review= of manuscripts and art by the Press for requirements of series\r\nformat and style, completeness and clarity of copy, and arrangement of all\r\nmaterial, as outlined below, will govern, within the judgment of the\r\nPress, acceptance or rejection of the manuscripts and art.\r\n\r\n=Copy= must be typewritten, double-spaced, on one side of standard white\r\nbond paper, with 1-1/4\" margins, submitted as ribbon copy (not carbon or\r\nxerox), in loose sheets (not stapled or bound), and accompanied by\r\noriginal art. Minimum acceptable length is 30 pages.\r\n\r\nFront matter (preceding the text) should include: =title page= with only\r\ntitle and author and no other information, =abstract page= with\r\nauthor/title/series/etc., following the established format, =table of\r\ncontents= with indents reflecting the heads and structure of the paper.\r\n\r\n=First page of text= should carry the title and author at the top of the\r\npage and an unnumbered footnote at the bottom consisting of author's name\r\nand professional mailing address.\r\n\r\n=Center heads= of whatever level should be typed with initial caps of\r\nmajor words, with extra space above and below the head, but with no other\r\npreparation (such as all caps or underline). Run-in paragraph heads should\r\nuse period/dashes or colons as necessary.\r\n\r\n=Tabulations= within text (lists of data, often in parallel columns) can\r\nbe typed on the text page where they occur, but they should not contain\r\nrules or formal, numbered table heads.\r\n\r\n=Formal tables= (numbered, with table heads, boxheads, stubs, rules)\r\nshould be submitted as camera copy, but the author must contact the series\r\nsection of the Press for editorial attention and preparation assistance\r\nbefore final typing of this matter.\r\n\r\n=Taxonomic keys= in natural history papers should use the alined-couplet\r\nform in the zoology and paleobiology series and the multi-level indent\r\nform in the botany series. If cross-referencing is required between key\r\nand text, do not include page references within the key, but number the\r\nkeyed-out taxa with their corresponding heads in the text.\r\n\r\n=Synonymy= in the zoology and paleobiology series must use the short form\r\n(taxon, author, year:page), with a full reference at the end of the paper\r\nunder \"Literature Cited.\" For the botany series, the long form (taxon,\r\nauthor, abbreviated journal or book title, volume, page, year, with no\r\nreference in the \"Literature Cited\") is optional.\r\n\r\n=Footnotes=, when few in number, whether annotative or bibliographic,\r\nshould be typed at the bottom of the text page on which the reference\r\noccurs. Extensive notes must appear at the end of the text in a notes\r\nsection.

Jones (1910:122).\"\r\n\r\n=Bibliography=, depending upon use, is termed \"References,\" \"Selected\r\nReferences,\" or \"Literature Cited.\" Spell out book, journal, and article\r\ntitles, using initial caps in all major words. For capitalization of\r\ntitles in foreign languages, follow the national practice of each\r\nlanguage. Underline (for italics) book and journal titles. Use the\r\ncolon-parentheses system for volume/number/page citations: \"10(2):5-9.\"\r\nFor alinement and arrangement of elements, follow the format of the series\r\nfor which the manuscript is intended.\r\n\r\n=Legends= for illustrations must not be attached to the art nor included\r\nwithin the text but must be submitted at the end of the manuscript--with\r\nas many legends typed, double-spaced, to a page as convenient.\r\n\r\n=Illustrations= must not be included within the manuscript but must be\r\nsubmitted separately as original art (not copies). All illustrations\r\n(photographs, line drawings, maps, etc.) can be intermixed throughout the\r\nprinted text. They should be termed =Figures= and should be numbered\r\nconsecutively. If several \"figures\" are treated as components of a single\r\nlarger figure, they should be designated by lowercase italic letters\r\n(underlined in copy) on the illustration, in the legend, and in text\r\nreferences: \"Figure 9+b+.\" If illustrations are intended to be printed\r\nseparately on coated stock following the text, they should be termed\r\n=Plates= and any components should be lettered as in figures: \"Plate\r\n9+b+.\" Keys to any symbols within an illustration should appear on the art\r\nand not in the legend.\r\n\r\n=A few points of style=: (1) Do not use periods after such abbreviations\r\nas \"mm, ft, yds, USNM, NNE, AM, BC.\" (2) Use hyphens in spelled-out\r\nfractions: \"two-thirds.\" (3) Spell out numbers \"one\" through \"nine\" in\r\nexpository text, but use numerals in all other cases if possible. (4) Use\r\nthe metric system of measurement, where possible, instead of the English\r\nsystem. (5) Use the decimal system, where possible, in place of fractions.\r\n(6) Use day/month/year sequence for dates: \"9 April 1976.\" (7) For months\r\nin tabular listings or data sections, use three-letter abbreviations with\r\nno periods: \"Jan, Mar, Jun,\" etc.\r\n\r\n=Arrange and paginate sequentially EVERY sheet of manuscript=--including\r\nALL front matter and ALL legends, etc., at the back of the text--in the\r\nfollowing order: (1) title page, (2) abstract, (3) table of contents, (4)\r\nforeword and/or preface, (5) text, (6) appendixes, (7) notes, (8)\r\nglossary, (9) bibliography, (10) index, (11) legends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Notes:\r\n\r\nPassages in italics are indicated by _underscore_.\r\n\r\nPassages in bold are indicated by =bold=.\r\n\r\nUnderlined passages are indicated by +underline+.\r\n\r\nSuperscripted letters are shown in {superscript}\r\n\r\nPunctuation has been corrected without note.\r\n\r\nThe following misprints have been corrected:\r\n  missing \"a\" added (Abstract)\r\n  \"sacrificator\" corrected to \"scarificator\" (page 2)\r\n  \"Ristelheuber\" corrected to \"Ristelhueber\" (page 14)\r\n  \"Pheonix\" corrected to \"Phoenix\" (page 14)\r\n  missing note marker 127 added\r\n  \"canula\" corrected to \"cannula\" (page 38)\r\n  \"rachet\" corrected to \"ratchet\" (page 41)\r\n  \"ocilloscope\" corrected to \"oscilloscope\" (page 41)\r\n  \"NHMT\" corrected to \"NMHT\" (page 44)\r\n  \"Divison\" corrected to \"Division\" (page 47)\r\n  \"Pennyslvania\" corrected to \"Pennsylvania\" (page 48)\r\n  \"Federick\" corrected to \"Frederick\" (page 48)\r\n  \"has has\" corrected to \"has (page 48)\r\n  \"sacrificator\" corrected to \"scarificator\" (page 48)\r\n  \"Sacrificator\" corrected to \"Scarificator\" (page 48)\r\n  \"cylindical\" corrected to \"cylindrical\" (page 53)\r\n  \"Septemper\" corrected to \"September\" (Note 3)\r\n  \"Hypochrondriasis\" corrected to \"Hypochondriasis\" (Note 80)\r\n  \"chirurguscher\" corrected to \"chirurgischer\" (page 63)\r\n\r\n\"Joseph-Frederic-Benoit Charriere (1803-1973)\" is presented as in the\r\noriginal text.\r\n\r\nOther than the corrections listed above, printer's inconsistencies in\r\nspelling and hyphenation usage have been retained.",
