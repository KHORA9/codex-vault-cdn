I hope that it has given them as much\r\nencouragement and help as they have given me.\r\n\r\nIn America, the home of so many systems of mental healing, it is\r\nperhaps even more necessary than in Europe to insist on the distinctive\r\nfeatures of M. Coué's teaching.  It is based, not on transcendental or\r\nmystical postulates, but on the simple and acknowledged facts of\r\npsychology.  This does not mean that it has no relation to religion.\r\nOn the contrary it has a very close one.  Indeed I hope in a future\r\nvolume to point out its deep significance for the Christian churches.\r\nBut that relationship remains in M. Coué's teaching unexpressed.  The\r\npowers he has revealed are part of the natural endowment of the human\r\nmind.  Therefore they are available to all men, independently of\r\nadherence or non-adherence to any sect or creed.\r\n\r\nThe method of M. Coué is in no sense opposed to the ordinary practice\r\nof medicine.  It is not intended to supplant it but to supplement it.\r\nIt is a new ally, bringing valuable reinforcements to the common\r\ncrusade against disease and unhappiness.\r\n\r\nInduced Autosuggestion does not involve, as several hasty critics have\r\nassumed, an attack upon the Will.  It simply teaches that during the\r\nactual formulation of suggestions, that is for a few minutes daily, the\r\nWill should be quiescent.  At other times the exercise of the Will is\r\nencouraged; indeed we are shown how to use it properly, that is without\r\nfriction or waste of energy.\r\n\r\nC. H. B.\r\n\r\n19 _October_, 1922.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHOR'S PREFACE\r\n\r\nThe discoveries of Emile Coué are of such moment for the happiness and\r\nefficiency of the individual life that it is the duty of anyone\r\nacquainted with them to pass them on to his fellows.\r\n\r\nThe lives of many men and women are robbed of their true value by\r\ntwists and flaws of character and temperament, which, while defying the\r\nefforts of the will, would yield rapidly to the influence of\r\nautosuggestion.  Unfortunately, the knowledge of this method has\r\nhitherto been available in England only in the somewhat detailed and\r\ntechnical work of Professor Charles Baudouin, and in a small pamphlet,\r\nprinted privately by M. Coué, which has not been publicly exposed for\r\nsale.  To fill this gap is the aim of the following pages.  They are\r\ndesigned to present to the layman in non-technical form the information\r\nnecessary to enable him to practise autosuggestion for himself.\r\n\r\nAll readers who wish to obtain a deeper insight into the theoretical\r\nbasis of autosuggestion are recommended to study Professor Baudouin's\r\nfascinating work, _Suggestion and Autosuggestion_.  Although in these\r\npages there are occasional divergences from Professor Baudouin's views,\r\nhis book remains beyond question the authoritative statement on the\r\nsubject; indeed it is hardly possible without it to form an adequate\r\nidea of the scope of autosuggestion.  My own indebtedness to it in\r\nwriting this little volume is very great.\r\n\r\nMy thanks are due for innumerable kindnesses to M. Coué himself.  That\r\nhe is the embodiment of patience everyone knows who has been in contact\r\nwith him.  I am also indebted to the Rev. Ernest Charles, of Malvern\r\nLink, who, though disclaiming responsibility for some of the views\r\nexpressed here, has made many extremely valuable suggestions.\r\n\r\nC. H. B.\r\n\r\nMALVERN LINK,\r\n  21 _February_, 1922.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREWORD\r\n\r\nThe materials for this little book were collected by Mr. Brooks during\r\na visit he paid me in the summer of 1921.  He was, I think, the first\r\nEnglishman to come to Nancy with the express purpose of studying my\r\nmethod of conscious autosuggestion.  In the course of daily visits\r\nextending over some weeks, by attending my consultations, and by\r\nprivate conversations with myself, he obtained a full mastery of the\r\nmethod, and we threshed out a good deal of the theory on which it rests.\r\n\r\nThe results of this study are contained in the following pages.  Mr.\r\nBrooks has skilfully seized on the essentials and put them forward in a\r\nmanner that seems to me both simple and clear.  The instructions given\r\nare amply sufficient to enable anyone to practise autosuggestion for\r\nhim or herself, without seeking the help of any other person.\r\n\r\nIt is a method which everyone should follow--the sick to obtain\r\nhealing, the healthy to prevent the coming of disease in the future.\r\nBy its practice we can insure for ourselves, all our lives long, an\r\nexcellent state of health, both of the mind and the body.\r\n\r\nE.

It was\r\nhere that I visited him in the early summer of 1921, and had the\r\npleasure for the first time of witnessing one of his consultations.\r\n\r\nWe entered the garden from his house a little before nine o'clock.  In\r\none corner was a brick building of two stories, with its windows thrown\r\nwide to let in the air and sunshine--this was the clinic; a few yards\r\naway was a smaller one-storied construction which served as a\r\nwaiting-room.  Under the plum and cherry trees, now laden with fruit,\r\nlittle groups of patients were sitting on the garden seats, chatting\r\namicably together and enjoying the morning sunshine while others\r\nwandered in twos and threes among the flowers and strawberry beds.  The\r\nroom reserved for the treatments was already crowded, but in spite of\r\nthat eager newcomers constantly tried to gain entrance.  The\r\nwindow-sills on the ground floor were beset, and a dense knot had\r\nformed in the doorway.  Inside, the patients had first occupied the\r\nseats which surrounded the walls, and then covered the available\r\nfloor-space, sitting on camp-stools and folding-chairs.  Coué with some\r\ndifficulty found me a seat, and the treatment immediately began.\r\n\r\nThe first patient he addressed was a frail, middle-aged man who,\r\naccompanied by his daughter, had just arrived from Paris to consult\r\nhim.  The man was a bad case of nervous trouble.  He walked with\r\ndifficulty, and his head, arms and legs were afflicted with a continual\r\ntremor.  He explained that if he encountered a stranger when walking in\r\nthe street the idea that the latter would remark his infirmity\r\ncompletely paralysed him, and he had to cling to whatever support was\r\nat hand to save himself from falling.  At Coué's invitation he rose\r\nfrom his seat and took a few steps across the floor.  He walked slowly,\r\nleaning on a stick; his knees were half bent, and his feet dragged\r\nheavily along the ground.\r\n\r\nCoué encouraged him with the promise of improvement.  \"You have been\r\nsowing bad seed in your Unconscious; now you will sow good seed.  The\r\npower by which you have produced these ill effects will in future\r\nproduce equally good ones.\"\r\n\r\nThe next patient was an excitable, over-worked woman of the artisan\r\nclass.  When Coué inquired the nature of her trouble, she broke into a\r\nflood of complaint, describing each symptom with a voluble minuteness.\r\n\"Madame,\" he interrupted, \"you think too much about your ailments, and\r\nin thinking of them you create fresh ones.\"\r\n\r\nNext came a girl with headaches, a youth with inflamed eyes, and a\r\nfarm-labourer incapacitated by varicose veins.  In each case Coué\r\nstated that autosuggestion should bring complete relief.  Then it was\r\nthe turn of a business man who complained of nervousness, lack of\r\nself-confidence and haunting fears.\r\n\r\n\"When you know the method,\" said Coué, \"you will not allow yourself to\r\nharbour such ideas.\"\r\n\r\n\"I work terribly hard to get rid of them,\" the patient answered.\r\n\r\n\"You fatigue yourself.  The greater the efforts you make, the more the\r\nideas return.  You will change all that easily, simply, and above all,\r\nwithout effort.\"\r\n\r\n\"I want to,\" the man interjected.\r\n\r\n\"That's just where you're wrong,\" Coué told him.  \"If you say 'I want\r\nto do something,' your imagination replies 'Oh, but you can't.'  You\r\nmust say 'I am going to do it,' and if it is in the region of the\r\npossible you will succeed.\"\r\n\r\nA little further on was another neurasthenic--a girl.  This was her\r\nthird visit to the clinic, and for ten days she had been practising the\r\nmethod at home.  With a happy smile, and a little pardonable\r\nself-importance, she declared that she already felt a considerable\r\nimprovement.  She had more energy, was beginning to enjoy life, ate\r\nheartily and slept more soundly.  Her sincerity and naïve delight\r\nhelped to strengthen the faith of her fellow-patients.  They looked on\r\nher as a living proof of the healing which should come to themselves.\r\n\r\nCoué continued his questions.  Those who were unable, whether through\r\nrheumatism or some paralytic affection, to make use of a limb were\r\ncalled on, as a criterion of future progress, to put out their maximum\r\nefforts.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the visitor from Paris there were present a man and a\r\nwoman who could not walk without support, and a burly peasant, formerly\r\na blacksmith, who for nearly ten years had not succeeded in lifting his\r\nright arm above the level of his shoulder.  In each case Coué predicted\r\na complete cure.\r\n\r\nDuring this preliminary stage of the treatment, the words he spoke were\r\nnot in the nature of suggestions.  They were sober expressions of\r\nopinion, based on years of experience.  Not once did he reject the\r\npossibility of cure, though with several patients suffering from\r\norganic disease in an advanced stage, he admitted its unlikelihood.  To\r\nthese he promised, however, a cessation of pain, an improvement of\r\nmorale, and at least a retardment of the progress of the disease.\r\n\"Meanwhile,\" he added, \"the limits of the power of autosuggestion are\r\nnot yet known; final recovery is possible.\"  In all cases of functional\r\nand nervous disorders, as well as the less serious ones of an organic\r\nnature, he stated that autosuggestion, conscientiously applied, was\r\ncapable of removing the trouble completely.\r\n\r\nIt took Coué nearly forty minutes to complete his interrogation.  Other\r\npatients bore witness to the benefits the treatment had already\r\nconferred on them.  A woman with a painful swelling in her breast,\r\nwhich a doctor had diagnosed (in Coué's opinion wrongly), as of a\r\ncancerous nature, had found complete relief after less than three\r\nweeks' treatment.  Another woman had enriched her impoverished blood,\r\nand increased her weight by over nine pounds.  A man had been cured of\r\na varicose ulcer, another in a single sitting had rid himself of a\r\nlifelong habit of stammering.  Only one of the former patients failed\r\nto report an improvement.  \"Monsieur,\" said Coué, \"you have been making\r\nefforts.  You must put your trust in the imagination, not in the will.\r\nThink you are better and you will become so.\"\r\n\r\nCoué now proceeded to outline the theory given in the pages which\r\nfollow.  It is sufficient here to state his main conclusions, which\r\nwere these: (1) Every idea which exclusively occupies the mind is\r\ntransformed into an actual physical or mental state.  (2) The efforts\r\nwe make to conquer an idea by exerting the will only serve to make that\r\nidea more powerful.  To demonstrate these truths he requested one of\r\nhis patients, a young anaemic-looking woman, to carry out a small\r\nexperiment.  She extended her arms in front of her, and clasped the\r\nhands firmly together with the fingers interlaced, increasing the force\r\nof her grip until a slight tremor set in.  \"Look at your hands,\" said\r\nCoué, \"and think you would like to open them but you cannot.  Now try\r\nand pull them apart.  Pull hard.  You find that the more you try the\r\nmore tightly they become clasped together.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl made little convulsive movements of her wrists, really doing\r\nher best by physical force to separate her hands, but the harder she\r\ntried the more her grip increased in strength, until the knuckles\r\nturned white with the pressure.  Her hands seemed locked together by a\r\nforce outside her own control.\r\n\r\n\"Now think,\" said Cone, \"'I can open my hands.'\"\r\n\r\nSlowly her grasp relaxed and, in response to a little pull, the cramped\r\nfingers came apart.  She smiled shyly at the attention she had\r\nattracted, and sat down.\r\n\r\nCoué pointed out that the two main points of his theory were thus\r\ndemonstrated simultaneously: when the patient's mind was filled with\r\nthe thought \"I cannot,\" she could not in very fact unclasp her hands.\r\nFurther, the efforts she made to wrench them apart by exerting her will\r\nonly fixed them more firmly together.\r\n\r\nEach patient was now called on in turn to perform the same experiment.\r\nThe more imaginative among them--notably the women--were at once\r\nsuccessful.  One old lady was so absorbed in the thought \"I cannot\" as\r\nnot to heed the request to think \"I can.\"  With her face ruefully\r\npuckered up she sat staring fixedly at her interlocked fingers, as\r\nthough contemplating an act of fate.  \"Voilà,\" said Coué, smiling, \"if\r\nMadame persists in her present idea, she will never open her hands\r\nagain as long as she lives.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral of the men, however, were not at once successful.  The whilom\r\nblacksmith with the disabled arm, when told to think \"I should like to\r\nopen my hands but I cannot,\" proceeded without difficulty to open them.\r\n\r\n\"You see,\" said Coué, with a smile, \"it depends not on what I say but\r\non what you think.  What were you thinking then?\"\r\n\r\nHe hesitated.  \"I thought perhaps I could open them after all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly.  And therefore you could.  Now clasp your hands again.  Press\r\nthem together.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the right degree of pressure had been reached, Coué told him to\r\nrepeat the words \"I cannot, I cannot....\"\r\n\r\nAs he repeated this phrase the contracture increased, and all his\r\nefforts failed to release his grip.\r\n\r\n\"Voilà,\" said Coué.  \"Now listen.  For ten years you have been thinking\r\nyou could not lift your arm above your shoulder, consequently you have\r\nnot been able to do so, for whatever we think becomes true for us.  Now\r\nthink 'I can lift it.'\"\r\n\r\nThe patient looked at him doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\"Quick!\" Coué said in a tone of authority.  \"Think 'I can, I can!'\"\r\n\r\n\"I can,\" said the man.  He made a half-hearted attempt and complained\r\nof a pain in his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Bon,\" said Coué.  \"Don't lower your arm.  Close your eyes and repeat\r\nwith me as fast as you can, 'Ca passe, ça passe.'\"\r\n\r\nFor half a minute they repeated this phrase together, speaking so fast\r\nas to produce a sound like the whirr of a rapidly revolving machine.\r\nMeanwhile Coué quickly stroked the man's shoulder.  At the end of that\r\ntime the patient admitted that his pain had left him.\r\n\r\n\"Now think well that you can lift your arm,\" Coué said.\r\n\r\nThe departure of the pain had given the patient faith.  His face, which\r\nbefore had been perplexed and incredulous, brightened as the thought of\r\npower took possession of him.  \"I can,\" he said in a tone of finality,\r\nand without effort he calmly lifted his arm to its full height above\r\nhis head.  He held it there triumphantly for a moment while the whole\r\ncompany applauded and encouraged him.\r\n\r\nCoué reached for his hand and shook it.\r\n\r\n\"My friend, you are cured.\"\r\n\r\n\"C'est merveilleux,\" the man answered.  \"I believe I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"Prove it,\" said Coué.  \"Hit me on the shoulder.\"\r\n\r\nThe patient laughed, and dealt him a gentle rap.\r\n\r\n\"Harder,\" Coué encouraged him.  \"Hit me harder--as hard as you can.\"\r\n\r\nHis arm began to rise and fall in regular blows, increasing in force\r\nuntil Coué was compelled to call on him to stop.\r\n\r\n\"Voilà, mon ami, you can go back to your anvil.\"\r\n\r\nThe man resumed his seat, still hardly able to comprehend what had\r\noccurred.  Now and then he lifted his arm as if to reassure himself,\r\nwhispering to himself in an awed voice, \"I can, I can.\"\r\n\r\nA little further on was seated a woman who had complained of violent\r\nneuralgia.  Under the influence of the repeated phrase \"ça passe\" (it's\r\ngoing) the pain was dispelled in less than thirty seconds.  Then it was\r\nthe turn of the visitor from Paris.  What he had seen had inspired him\r\nwith confidence; he was sitting more erect, there was a little patch of\r\ncolour in his cheeks, and his trembling seemed less violent.\r\n\r\nHe performed the experiment with immediate success.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Coué, \"you are cultivated ground.  I can throw out the seed\r\nin handfuls.\"\r\n\r\nHe caused the sufferer first to stand erect with his back and knees\r\nstraightened.  Then he asked him, constantly thinking \"I can,\" to place\r\nhis entire weight on each foot in turn, slowly performing the exercise\r\nknown as \"marking time.\"  A space was then cleared of chairs, and\r\nhaving discarded his stick, the man was made to walk to and fro.  When\r\nhis gait became slovenly Coué stopped him, pointed out his fault, and,\r\nrenewing the thought \"I can,\" caused him to correct it.  Progressive\r\nimprovement kindled the man's imagination.  He took himself in his own\r\nhands.  His bearing became more and more confident, he walked more\r\neasily, more quickly.  His little daughter, all smiles and happy\r\nself-forgetfulness, stood beside him uttering expressions of delight,\r\nadmiration and encouragement.  The whole company laughed and clapped\r\ntheir hands.\r\n\r\n\"After the sitting,\" said Coué, \"you shall come for a run in my garden.\"\r\n\r\nThus Coué continued his round of the clinic.  Each patient suffering\r\nfrom pain was given complete or partial relief; those with useless\r\nlimbs had a varying measure of use restored to them.  Coué's manner was\r\nalways quietly inspiring.  There was no formality, no attitude of the\r\nsuperior person; he treated everyone, whether rich or poor, with the\r\nsame friendly solicitude.  But within these limits he varied his tone\r\nto suit the temperament of the patient.  Sometimes he was firm,\r\nsometimes gently bantering.  He seized every opportunity for a little\r\nhumorous by-play.  One might almost say that he tactfully teased some\r\nof his patients, giving them an idea that their ailment was absurd, and\r\na little unworthy; that to be ill was a quaint but reprehensible\r\nweakness, which they should quickly get rid of.  Indeed, this denial of\r\nthe dignity of disease is one of the characteristics of the place.  No\r\nhomage is paid to it as a Dread Monarch.  It is gently ridiculed, its\r\nterrors are made to appear second-rate, and its victims end by laughing\r\nat it.\r\n\r\nCoué now passed on to the formulation of specific suggestions.  The\r\npatients closed their eyes, and he proceeded in a low, monotonous\r\nvoice, to evoke before their minds the states of health, mental and\r\nphysical, they were seeking.  As they listened to him their alertness\r\nebbed away, they were lulled into a drowsy state, peopled only by the\r\nvivid images he called up before the eyes of the mind.  The faint\r\nrustle of the trees, the songs of the birds, the low voices of those\r\nwaiting in the garden, merged into a pleasant background, on which his\r\nwords stood out powerfully.\r\n\r\nThis is what he said:\r\n\r\n\"Say to yourself that all the words I am about to utter will be fixed,\r\nimprinted and engraven in your minds; that they will remain fixed,\r\nimprinted and engraven there, so that without your will and knowledge,\r\nwithout your being in any way aware of what is taking place, you\r\nyourself and your whole organism will obey them.  I tell you first that\r\nevery day, three times a day, morning, noon and evening, at mealtimes,\r\nyou will be hungry; that is to say you will feel that pleasant\r\nsensation which makes us think and say: 'How I should like something to\r\neat!'  You will then eat with excellent appetite, enjoying your food,\r\nbut you will never eat too much.  You will eat the right amount,\r\nneither too much nor too little, and you will know intuitively when you\r\nhave had sufficient.  You will masticate your food thoroughly,\r\ntransforming it into a smooth paste before swallowing it.  In these\r\nconditions you will digest it well, and so feel no discomfort of any\r\nkind either in the stomach or the intestines.  Assimilation will be\r\nperfectly performed, and your organism will make the best possible use\r\nof the food to create blood, muscle, strength, energy, in a word--Life.\r\n\r\n\"Since you have digested your food properly, the excretory functions\r\nwill be normally performed.  This will take place every morning\r\nimmediately on rising, and without your having recourse to any laxative\r\nmedicine or artificial means of any kind.\r\n\r\n\"Every night you will fall asleep at the hour you wish, and will\r\ncontinue to sleep until the hour at which you desire to wake next\r\nmorning.  Your sleep will be calm, peaceful and profound, untroubled by\r\nbad dreams or undesirable states of body.  You may dream, but your\r\ndreams will be pleasant ones.  On waking you will feel well, bright,\r\nalert, eager for the day's tasks.\r\n\r\n\"If in the past you have been subject to depression, gloom and\r\nmelancholy forebodings, you will henceforward be free from such\r\ntroubles.  Instead of being moody, anxious and depressed, you will be\r\ncheerful and happy.  You will be happy even if you have no particular\r\nreason for being so, just as in the past you were, without good reason,\r\nunhappy.  I tell you even that if you have serious cause to be worried\r\nor depressed, you will not be so.\r\n\r\n\"If you have been impatient or ill-tempered, you will no longer be\r\nanything of the kind; on the contrary, you will always be patient and\r\nself-controlled.  The happenings which used to irritate you will leave\r\nyou entirely calm and unmoved.\r\n\r\n\"If you have sometimes been haunted by evil and unwholesome ideas, by\r\nfears or phobias, these ideas will gradually cease to occupy your mind.\r\nThey will melt away like a cloud.  As a dream vanishes when we wake, so\r\nwill these vain images disappear.\r\n\r\n\"I add that all your organs do their work perfectly.  Your heart beats\r\nnormally and the circulation of the blood takes place as it should.\r\nThe lungs do their work well.  The stomach, the intestines, the liver,\r\nthe biliary duct, the kidneys and the bladder, all carry out their\r\nfunctions correctly.  If at present any of the organs named is out of\r\norder, the disturbance will grow less day by day, so that within a\r\nshort space of time it will have entirely disappeared, and the organ\r\nwill have resumed its normal function.\r\n\r\n\"Further, if in any organ there is a structural lesion, it will from\r\nthis day be gradually repaired, and in a short period will be\r\ncompletely restored.  This will be so even if you are unaware that the\r\ntrouble exists.\r\n\r\n\"I must also add--and it is extremely important--that if in the past\r\nyou have lacked confidence in yourself, this self-distrust will\r\ngradually disappear.  You will have confidence in yourself; I repeat,\r\n_you will have confidence_.  Your confidence will be based on the\r\nknowledge of the immense power which is within you, by which you can\r\naccomplish any task of which your reason approves.  With this\r\nconfidence you will be able to do anything you wish to do, provided it\r\nis reasonable, and anything it is your duty to do.\r\n\r\n\"When you have any task to perform you will always think that it is\r\neasy.  Such words as 'difficult,' 'impossible,' 'I cannot' will\r\ndisappear from your vocabulary.  Their place will be taken by this\r\nphrase: 'It is easy and I can.'  So, considering your work easy, even\r\nif it is difficult to others, it will become easy to you.  You will do\r\nit easily, without effort and without fatigue.\"\r\n\r\nThese general suggestions were succeeded by particular suggestions\r\nreferring to the special ailments from which Coué's patients were\r\nsuffering.  Taking each case in turn, he allowed his hand to rest\r\nlightly on the heads of the sufferers, while picturing to their minds\r\nthe health and vigour with which they would soon be endowed.  Thus to a\r\nwoman with an ulcerated leg he spoke as follows: \"Henceforth your\r\norganism will do all that is necessary to restore your leg to perfect\r\nhealth.  It will rapidly heal; the tissues will regain their tone; the\r\nskin will be soft and healthy.  In a short space of time your leg will\r\nbe vigorous and strong and will in future always remain so.\"  Each\r\nspecial complaint was thus treated with a few appropriate phrases.\r\nWhen he had finished, and the patients were called on to open their\r\neyes, a faint sigh went round the room, as if they were awaking\r\nreluctantly from a delicious dream.\r\n\r\nCoué now explained to his patients that he possessed no healing powers,\r\nand had never healed a person in his life.  They carried in themselves\r\nthe instrument of their own well-being.  The results they had seen were\r\ndue to the realisation of each patient's own thought.  He had been\r\nmerely an agent calling the ideas of health into their minds.\r\nHenceforth they could, and must, be the pilots of their own destiny.\r\nHe then requested them to repeat, under conditions which will be later\r\ndefined, the phrase with which his name is associated: \"Day by day, in\r\nevery way, I'm getting better and better.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThe sitting was at an end.  The patients rose and crowded round Coué,\r\nasking questions, thanking him, shaking him by the hand.  Some declared\r\nthey were already cured, some that they were much better, others that\r\nthey were confident of cure in the future.  It was as if a burden of\r\ndepression had fallen from their minds.  Those who had entered with\r\nminds crushed and oppressed went out with hope and optimism shining in\r\ntheir faces.\r\n\r\nBut Coué waved aside these too insistent admirers, and, beckoning to\r\nthe three patients who could not walk, led them to a corner of the\r\ngarden where there was a stretch of gravel path running beneath the\r\nboughs of fruit trees.  Once more impressing on their minds the thought\r\nof strength and power, he induced each one to walk without support down\r\nthis path.  He now invited them to run.  They hesitated, but he\r\ninsisted, telling them that they could run, that they ought to run,\r\nthat they had but to believe in their own power, and their thought\r\nwould be manifested in action.\r\n\r\nThey started rather uncertainly, but Coué followed them with persistent\r\nencouragements.  They began to raise their heads, to lift their feet\r\nfrom the ground and run with greater freedom and confidence.  Turning\r\nat the end of the path they came back at a fair pace.  Their movements\r\nwere not elegant, but people on the further side of fifty are rarely\r\nelegant runners.  It was a surprising sight to see these three\r\nsufferers who had hobbled to the clinic on sticks now covering the\r\nground at a full five miles an hour, and laughing heartily at\r\nthemselves as they ran.  The crowd of patients who had collected broke\r\ninto a spontaneous cheer, and Coué, slipping modestly away, returned to\r\nthe fresh company of sufferers who awaited him within.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The translation given here of Coué's formula differs slightly from\r\nthat popularised in England during his visit of November, 1921.  The\r\nabove, however, is the English version which he considers most suitable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nA FEW OF COUÉ'S CURES\r\n\r\nTo give the reader a better idea of the results which Induced\r\nAutosuggestion is yielding, I shall here describe a few further cases\r\nof which I was myself in some part a witness, and thereafter let some\r\nof Coué's patients speak for themselves through the medium of their\r\nletters.\r\n\r\nAt one of the morning consultations which I subsequently attended was a\r\nwoman who had suffered for five years with dyspepsia.  The trouble had\r\nrecently become so acute that even the milk diet to which she was now\r\nreduced caused her extreme discomfort.  Consequently she had become\r\nextremely thin and anaemic, was listless, easily tired, and suffered\r\nfrom depression.  Early in the proceedings the accounts given by\r\nseveral patients of the relief they had obtained seemed to appeal to\r\nher imagination.  She followed Coué's remarks with keen interest,\r\nanswered his questions vivaciously, and laughed very heartily at the\r\namusing incidents with which the proceedings were interspersed.  About\r\nfive o'clock on the same afternoon I happened to be sitting with Coué\r\nwhen this woman asked to see him.  Beaming with satisfaction, she was\r\nshown into the room.  She reported that on leaving the clinic she had\r\ngone to a restaurant in the town and ordered a table d'hôte luncheon.\r\nConscientiously she had partaken of every course from the hors\r\nd'oeuvres to the café noir.  The meal had been concluded at 1.30, and\r\nshe had so far experienced no trace of discomfort.  A few days later\r\nthis woman returned to the clinic to report that the dyspepsia had\r\nshown no signs of reappearing; that her health and spirits were\r\nimproving, and that she looked upon herself as cured.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion one of the patients complained of asthma.  The\r\nparoxysms destroyed his sleep at night and prevented him from\r\nperforming any task which entailed exertion.  Walking upstairs was a\r\nslow process attended by considerable distress.  The experiment with\r\nthe hands was so successfully performed that Coué assured him of\r\nimmediate relief.\r\n\r\n\"Before you go,\" he said, \"you will run up and down those stairs\r\nwithout suffering any inconvenience.\"\r\n\r\nAt the close of the consultation, under the influence of the suggestion\r\n\"I can,\" the patient did this without difficulty.  That night the\r\ntrouble recurred in a mild form, but he continued to attend the clinic\r\nand to practise the exercises at home, and within a fortnight the\r\nasthma had finally left him.\r\n\r\nAmong other patients with whom I conversed was a young man suffering\r\nfrom curvature of the spine.  He had been attending the clinic for four\r\nmonths and practising the method at home.  His doctor assured him that\r\nthe spine was gradually resuming its normal position.  A girl of\r\ntwenty-two had suffered from childhood with epileptic fits, recurring\r\nat intervals of a few weeks.  Since her first visit to the clinic six\r\nmonths previously the fits had ceased.\r\n\r\nBut the soundest testimony to the power of Induced Autosuggestion is\r\nthat borne by the patients themselves.  Here are a few extracts from\r\nletters received by Coué:\r\n\r\n\"At the age of sixty-three, attacked for more than thirty years by\r\nasthma and all the complications attendant upon it, I spent\r\nthree-quarters of the night sitting on my bed inhaling the smoke of\r\nanti-asthma powders.  Afflicted with almost daily attacks, especially\r\nduring the cold and damp seasons, I was unable to walk--I could not\r\neven _go down hill_.\r\n\r\nNowadays I have splendid nights, and have put the powders in a drawer.\r\nWithout the slightest hesitation I can go upstairs to the first floor.\"\r\n\r\n  D. (Mont de Marsan.)\r\n  15 _December_, 1921.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yesterday I felt really better, that is to say, of my fever, so I\r\ndecided to go back to my doctor, whom I had not seen since the summer.\r\nThe examination showed a normal appendix.  On the other hand, the\r\nbladder is still painful, but is better.  At any rate, there is at\r\npresent no question of the operation which had worried me so much.  I\r\nam convinced that I shall cure myself completely.\"\r\n\r\n  M. D. (Mulhouse.)\r\n  24 _September_, 1921.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I have very good news to give you of your dipsomaniac--she is cured,\r\nand asserts it herself to all who will listen.  She told me yesterday\r\nthat for fourteen years she had not been so long without drink as she\r\nhas been lately, and what surprises her so much is that she has not had\r\nto struggle against a desire; she has simply not felt the need of\r\ndrink.  Further, her sleep continues to be splendid.  She is getting\r\nmore and more calm, in spite of the fact that on several occasions her\r\nsang-froid has been severely tested.  To put the matter in a nutshell,\r\nshe is a changed woman.  But what impresses me most is the fact that\r\nwhen she took to your method she thought herself at the end of her\r\ntether, and in the event of its doing her no good had decided to kill\r\nherself (she had already attempted it once).\"\r\n\r\n  P. (a Paris doctor.)\r\n  1 _February_, 1922.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"For eight years I suffered with prolapse of the uterus.  I have used\r\nyour method of Autosuggestion for the last five months, and am now\r\ncompletely cured, for which I do not know how to thank you enough.\"\r\n\r\n  S. (Toul).[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I have a son who came back from Germany very anaemic and suffering\r\nfrom terrible depression.  He went to see you for a short time, and now\r\nis as well as possible.  Please accept my best thanks.  I have also a\r\nlittle cousin whom you have cured.  He had a nervous illness, and had\r\nbecome, so to speak, unconscious of what was going on around him.  He\r\nis now completely cured.\"\r\n\r\n  S. E. (Circourt, Vosges.)\r\n  19 _October_, 1921.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"My wife and I have waited nearly a year to thank you for the\r\nmarvellous cure which your method has accomplished.  The very violent\r\nattacks of asthma from which my wife suffered have completely\r\ndisappeared since the visit you paid us last spring.  The first few\r\nweeks my wife experienced temporary oppression and even the beginnings\r\nof an attack, which, however, she was able to ward off within a few\r\nminutes by practising Autosuggestion.\r\n\r\nIn spite of her great desire to thank you sooner my wife wished to add\r\nmore weight to her testimony by waiting for nearly a year.  But the bad\r\ntime for asthma has not brought the slightest hint of the terrible\r\nattacks from which you saved her.\"\r\n\r\n  J. H. (Saarbruck.)\r\n  23 _December_, 1921.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"All the morbid symptoms from which I used to suffer have disappeared.\r\nI used to feel as though I had a band of iron across my brain which\r\nseemed to be red-hot; added to this I had heartburn and bad nights with\r\nfearful dreams; further, I was subject to severe nervous attacks which\r\nwent on for months.  I felt as though pegs were being driven into the\r\nsides of my head and nape of my neck, and when I felt I could not\r\nendure these agonies any longer a feeling would come as if my brain\r\nwere being smothered in a blanket.  All these pains came and went.  I\r\nhad sometimes one, sometimes others.  There were occasions when I\r\nwanted to die--my sufferings were so acute, and I had to struggle\r\nagainst the idea with great firmness.\r\n\r\nAt last, having spent five weeks at Nancy attending your kindly\r\nsittings, I have profited so well as to be able to return home in a\r\nstate of normal health.\"\r\n\r\n  N. (Pithiviviers le Vieil.)\r\n  16 _August_, 1921.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"After having undergone four operations on the left leg for local\r\ntuberculosis I fell a victim once more to the same trouble on 1\r\nSeptember, 1920.  Several doctors whom I consulted declared a new\r\noperation necessary.  My leg was to be opened from the knee to the\r\nankle, and if the operation failed nothing remained but an amputation.\r\n\r\nHaving heard of your cures, I came to see you for the first time on 6\r\nNovember, 1920.  After the sitting I felt at once a little better.  I\r\nfollowed your instructions exactly, visiting you three times.  At the\r\nthird time I was able to tell you that I was completely cured.\"\r\n\r\n  L. (Herny, Lorraine.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I am happy to tell you that a bunion that I had on my foot, which grew\r\nto a considerable size and gave me the most acute pain for over fifteen\r\nyears, has gone.\"\r\n\r\n  L. G. (Caudéran, Gironde.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I cannot leave France without letting you know how grateful I feel for\r\nthe immense service you have rendered me and mine.  I only wish I had\r\nmet you years ago.  Practically throughout my career my curse has been\r\na lack of continuous self-control.\r\n\r\nI have been accused of being almost brilliant at times, only to be\r\nfollowed by periodic relapses into a condition of semi-imbecility and\r\nself-indulgence.\r\n\r\nI have done my best to ruin a magnificent constitution, and have wasted\r\nthe abilities bestowed upon me.  In a few short days you have made\r\nme--and I feel permanently--master of myself.  How can I thank you\r\nsufficiently?\r\n\r\nThe rapidity of my complete cure may have been due to what at the time\r\nI regarded as an unfortunate accident.  Slipping on the snow-covered\r\nsteps of the train when alighting, I sprained my right knee badly.  At\r\nthe breakfast table, before paying you my first visit, a fellow-guest\r\nsaid to me: 'Tell Monsieur Coué about it.  He will put it all right.'\r\n\r\nI laughed and said 'Umph!' to myself, and more for the fun of the thing\r\nthan anything else did tell you.  I remember you remarking 'That's\r\nnothing,' and passing on to the more serious part of our conversation,\r\npreliminary to commencing your lecture to the assembled patients.\r\n\r\nI became more than interested, and when at the conclusion you suddenly\r\nturned round and asked me: 'How's your knee?' (not having alluded to\r\nknees in particular), and I discovered there _wasn't_ a knee, I laughed\r\nagain, as did those who saw me hobble into your room; but I laughed\r\nthis time from a sense of bewildered surprise and dawning belief.  This\r\nbelief you very soon firmly implanted in me.\"\r\n\r\n  G. H. (London.)\r\n  11 _January_, 1922.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] This letter, together with the two quoted on page 34, is reprinted\r\nfrom the _Bulletin de la Société Lorraine de Psychologie Appliquée_ of\r\nApril, 1921.  They were received by Coué during the preceding three\r\nmonths.  The other letters were communicated to me privately by Coué\r\nand bear their original dates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE CHILDREN'S CLINIC\r\n\r\nIn different parts of France a little band of workers, recruited almost\r\nexclusively from the ranks of former patients, is propagating the ideas\r\nof Emile Coué with a success which almost rivals that of their master.\r\nAmong these helpers none is more devoted or more eminently successful\r\nthan Mlle. Kauffmant.  She it is who, at the time of my visit, was\r\nmanaging the children's department of the Nancy clinic.[1]\r\n\r\nWhile Coué was holding his consultations on the ground floor, young\r\nmothers in twos and threes, with their babies in their arms, could be\r\nseen ascending to the upper story, where a little drama was performed\r\nof a very different nature from that going on below.\r\n\r\nIn a large room, decorated with bright pictures and equipped with toys,\r\na number of silent young women were seated in a wide circle.  Their\r\nsick children lay in their arms or played at their feet.  Here was a\r\nchild whose life was choked at the source by hereditary disease--a\r\nsmall bundle of skin and bone with limbs like bamboo canes.  Another\r\nlay motionless with closed eyes and a deathly face, as if pining to\r\nreturn to the world it came from.  A little cripple dragged behind it a\r\ndeformed leg as it tried to crawl, and near by a child of five was\r\nbeating the air with its thin arms in an exhausting nervous storm.\r\nOlder children were also present, suffering from eye and ear trouble,\r\nepilepsy, rickets, any one of the ailments, grave or slight, to which\r\ngrowing life is subjected.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of this circle sat a young woman with dark hair and a\r\nkindly keen face.  On her lap was a little boy of four years with a\r\nclub foot.  As she gently caressed the foot, from which the clumsy boot\r\nhad been removed, she told in a crooning tone, mingled with endearing\r\nphrases, of the rapid improvement which had already begun and would\r\nsoon be complete.  The foot was getting better; the joints were more\r\nsupple and bent with greater ease; the muscles were developing, the\r\ntendons were drawing the foot into the right shape and making it\r\nstraight and strong.  Soon it would be perfectly normal; the little one\r\nwould walk and run, play with other children, skip and bowl hoops.  He\r\nwould go to school and learn his lessons, would be intelligent and\r\nreceptive.  She told him too that he was growing obedient, cheerful,\r\nkind to others, truthful and courageous.  The little boy had put one\r\narm round her neck and was listening with a placid smile.  His face was\r\nquite contented; he was enjoying himself.\r\n\r\nWhile Mlle. Kauffmant was thus engaged, the women sat silent watching\r\nher intently, each perhaps mentally seeing her own little one endowed\r\nwith the qualities depicted.  The children were quiet, some dreamily\r\nlistening, some tranquilly playing with a toy.  Except for an\r\noccasional word of advice Mademoiselle was quite indifferent to them.\r\nHer whole attention was given to the child on her knee; her thought\r\nwent out to him in a continual stream, borne along by a current of love\r\nand compassion, for she has devoted her life to the children and loves\r\nthem as if they were her own.  The atmosphere of the room was more like\r\nthat of a church than a hospital.  The mothers seemed to have left\r\ntheir sorrows outside.  Their faces showed in varying degrees an\r\nexpression of quiet confidence.\r\n\r\nWhen this treatment had continued for about ten minutes, Mlle.\r\nKauffmant returned the child to its mother and, after giving her a few\r\nwords of advice, turned to her next patient.  This was an infant of\r\nless than twelve months.  While suffering from no specific disease it\r\nwas continually ailing.  It was below normal weight, various foods had\r\nbeen tried unsuccessfully, and medical advice had failed to bring about\r\nan improvement.  Mademoiselle resumed her seat with the child on her\r\nlap.  For some time the caresses, which were applied to the child's\r\nhead and body, continued in silence.  Then she began to talk to it.\r\nHer talk did not consist of connected sentences, as with the elder\r\nchild who had learned to speak, but of murmured assurances, as if her\r\nthoughts were taking unconsciously the form of words.  These\r\nsuggestions were more general than in the previous case, bearing on\r\nappetite, digestion, assimilation, and on desirable mental and moral\r\nqualities.  The caress continued for about ten minutes, the speech was\r\nintermittent, then the infant was returned to its mother and\r\nMademoiselle turned her attention to another little sufferer.\r\n\r\nWith patients who are not yet old enough to speak Mlle. Kauffmant\r\nsometimes trusts to the caress alone.  It seems to transmit the\r\nthoughts of health quite strongly enough to turn the balance in the\r\nchild's mind on the side of health.  But all mothers talk to their\r\nchildren long before the words they use are understood, and Mlle.\r\nKauffmant, whose attitude is essentially maternal, reserves to herself\r\nthe same right.  She adheres to no rigid rule; if she wishes to speak\r\naloud she does so, even when the child cannot grasp the meaning of her\r\nwords.\r\n\r\nThis is perhaps the secret of her success: her method is plastic like\r\nthe minds she works on.  Coué's material--the adult mind--is more\r\nstable.  It demands a clear-cut, distinct method, and leaves less room\r\nfor adaptation; but the aim of Mlle. Kauffmant is to fill the child\r\nwithin and enwrap it without with the creative thoughts of health and\r\njoy.  To this end she enlists any and every means within her power.\r\nThe child itself, as soon as it is old enough to speak, is required to\r\nsay, morning and night, the general formula: \"Day by day, in every way,\r\nI'm getting better and better.\"  If it is confined to its bed, it is\r\nencouraged to repeat this at any time and to make suggestions of health\r\nsimilar to those formulated in the sittings.  No special directions are\r\ngiven as to how this should be done.  Elaborate instructions would only\r\nintroduce hindersome complications.  Imagination, the power to pretend,\r\nis naturally strong and active in all children, and intuitively they\r\nmake use of it in their autosuggestions.  Moreover, they unconsciously\r\nimitate the tone and manner of their instructress.\r\n\r\nBut the centre of the child's universe is the mother.  Any system which\r\ndid not utilise her influence would be losing its most powerful ally.\r\nThe mother is encouraged during the day to set an example of\r\ncheerfulness and confidence, to allude to the malady only in terms of\r\nencouragement--so renewing in the child's mind the prospect of\r\nrecovery--and to exclude as far as possible all depressing influences\r\nfrom its vicinity.  At night she is required to enter the child's\r\nbedchamber without waking the little one and to whisper good\r\nsuggestions into its sleeping ear.  Thus Mlle. Kauffmant concentrates a\r\nmultiplicity of means to bring about the same result.  In this she is\r\naided by the extreme acceptivity of the child's mind, and by the\r\nabsence of that mass of pernicious spontaneous suggestions which in the\r\nadult mind have to be neutralised and transformed.  It is in children,\r\nthen, that the most encouraging results may be expected.  I will quote\r\nthree cases which I myself investigated to show the kind of results\r\nMlle. Kauffmant obtains:\r\n\r\nA little girl was born without the power of sight.  The visual organs\r\nwere intact, but she was incapable of lifting her eye-lids and so\r\nremained blind to all intents and purposes up to her seventh year.  She\r\nwas then brought by the mother to Mlle. Kauffmant.  After a fortnight's\r\ntreatment the child began to blink; gradually this action became more\r\nfrequent, and a month after the treatment began she could see well\r\nenough to find her way unaided about the streets.  When I saw her she\r\nhad learnt to distinguish colours--as my own experiments proved--and\r\nwas actually playing ball.  The details supplied by Mlle. Kauffmant\r\nwere confirmed by the mother.\r\n\r\nA child was born whose tuberculous father had died during the mother's\r\npregnancy.  Of five brothers and sisters none had survived the first\r\nyear.  The doctors to whom the child was taken held out no hope for its\r\nlife.  It survived, however, to the age of two, but was crippled and\r\nnearly blind, in addition to internal weaknesses.  It was then brought\r\nto Mlle. Kauffmant.  Three months later, when I saw it, nothing\r\nremained of its troubles but a slight squint and a stiffness in one of\r\nits knee-joints.  These conditions, too, were rapidly diminishing.\r\n\r\nAnother child, about nine years of age, also of tuberculous parents,\r\nwas placed under her treatment.  One leg was an inch and a half shorter\r\nthan the other.  After a few months' treatment this disparity had\r\nalmost disappeared.  The same child had a wound, also of tuberculous\r\norigin, on the small of the back, which healed over in a few weeks and\r\nhad completely disappeared when I saw her.\r\n\r\nIn each of the above cases the general state of health showed a great\r\nimprovement.  The child put on weight, was cheerful and bright even\r\nunder the trying conditions of convalescence in a poverty-stricken\r\nhome, and in character and disposition fully realised the suggestions\r\nformulated to it.\r\n\r\nSince the suggestions of Mlle. Kauffmant are applied individually, the\r\nmothers were permitted to enter and leave the clinic at any time they\r\nwished.  Mademoiselle was present on certain days every week, but this\r\nwas not the sum of her labours.  The greater part of her spare time was\r\nspent in visiting the little ones in their own homes.  She penetrated\r\ninto the dingiest tenements, the poorest slums, on this errand of\r\nmercy.  I was able to accompany her on several of these visits, and saw\r\nher everywhere received not only with welcome, but with a respect akin\r\nto awe.  She was regarded, almost as much as Coué himself, as a worker\r\nof miracles.  But the reputation of both Coué and Mlle. Kauffmant rests\r\non a broader basis even than autosuggestion, namely on their great\r\ngoodness of heart.\r\n\r\nThey have placed not only their private means, but their whole life at\r\nthe service of others.  Neither ever accepts a penny-piece for the\r\ntreatments they give, and I have never seen Coué refuse to give a\r\ntreatment at however awkward an hour the subject may have asked it.\r\nThe fame of the school has now spread to all parts not only of France,\r\nbut of Europe and America.  Coué's work has assumed such proportions\r\nthat his time is taken up often to the extent of fifteen or sixteen\r\nhours a day.  He is now nearing his seventieth year, but thanks to the\r\nhealth-giving powers of his own method he is able to keep abreast of\r\nhis work without any sign of fatigue and without the clouding of his\r\nhabitual cheerfulness by even the shadow of a complaint.  In fact, he\r\nis a living monument to the efficacy of Induced Autosuggestion.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that Induced Autosuggestion is a method by which the\r\nmind can act directly upon itself and upon the body to produce whatever\r\nimprovements, in reason, we desire.  That it is efficient and\r\nsuccessful should be manifest from what has gone before.  Of all the\r\nquestions which arise, the most urgent from the viewpoint of the\r\naverage man seems to be this--Is a suggester necessary?  Must one\r\nsubmit oneself to the influence of some other person, or can one in the\r\nprivacy of one's own chamber exercise with equal success this potent\r\ninstrument of health?\r\n\r\nCoué's own opinion has already been quoted.  Induced Autosuggestion is\r\n_not_ dependent upon the mediation of another person.  We can practise\r\nit for ourselves without others being even aware of what we are doing,\r\nand without devoting to it more than a few minutes of each day.\r\n\r\nHere are a few quotations from letters written by those who have thus\r\npractised it for themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"For a good many years now a rheumatic right shoulder has made it\r\nimpossible for me to sleep on my right side and it seriously affected,\r\nand increasingly so, the use of my right arm.  A masseuse told me she\r\ncould effect no permanent improvement as there was granulation of the\r\njoints and a lesion.  I suddenly realised two days ago that this\r\nshoulder no longer troubled me and that I was sleeping on that side\r\nwithout any pain.  I have now lost any sensation of rheumatism in this\r\nshoulder and can get my right arm back as far as the other without the\r\nslightest twinge or discomfort.  I have not applied any remedy or done\r\nanything that could possibly have worked these results except my\r\npractise of Coué.\"\r\n\r\n  L. S. (Sidmouth, Devon).\r\n  1 _January_, 1922.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"At my suggestion a lady friend of mine who had been ill for a good ten\r\nyears read _La Maîtrise de soi-meme_.  I encouraged her as well as I\r\ncould, and in a month she was transformed.  Her husband, returning from\r\na long journey, could not believe his eyes.  This woman who never got\r\nup till midday, who never left the fire-side, whom the doctors had\r\ngiven up, now goes out at 10 a.m. even in the greatest cold.

The traditional psychology was regarded by the layman, not\r\nwithout some cause, as a dull and seemingly useless classification of\r\nour conscious faculties.  But within the past twenty-five years the\r\nscience has undergone a great change.  A revolution has taken place in\r\nit which seems likely to provoke a revolution equally profound in the\r\nwider limits of our common life.  From a preoccupation with the\r\nconscious it has turned to the Unconscious (or subconscious), to the\r\nvast area of mental activity which exists outside the circle of our\r\nawareness.  In doing so it has grasped at the very roots of life\r\nitself, has groped down to the depths where the \"life-force,\" the élan\r\nvital, touches our individual being.  What this may entail in the\r\nfuture we can only dimly guess.  Just as the discovery of America\r\naltered the balance of the Old World, shifting it westward to the\r\nshores of the Atlantic, so the discovery and investigation of the\r\nUnconscious seems destined to shift the balance of human life.\r\n\r\nObviously, this is no place to embark on the discussion of a subject of\r\nsuch extreme complexity.  The investigation of the Unconscious is a\r\nscience in itself, in which different schools of thought are seeking to\r\ndisengage a basis of fact from conflicting and daily changing theories.\r\nBut there is a certain body of fact, experimentally proven, on which\r\nthe authorities agree, and of this we quote a few features which\r\ndirectly interest us as students of autosuggestion.\r\n\r\nThe Unconscious is the storehouse of memory, where every impression we\r\nreceive from earliest infancy to the last hour of life is recorded with\r\nthe minutest accuracy.  These memories, however, are not inert and\r\nquiescent, like the marks on the vulcanite records of a gramophone;\r\nthey are vitally active, each one forming a thread in the texture of\r\nour personality.  The sum of all these impressions is the man himself,\r\nthe ego, the form through which the general life is individualised.\r\nThe outer man is but a mask; the real self dwells behind the veil of\r\nthe Unconscious.\r\n\r\nThe Unconscious is also a power-house.  It is dominated by feeling, and\r\nfeeling is the force which impels our lives.  It provides the energy\r\nfor conscious thought and action, and for the performance of the vital\r\nprocesses of the body.\r\n\r\nFinally the Unconscious plays the part of supervisor over our physical\r\nprocesses.  Digestion, assimilation, the circulation of the blood, the\r\naction of the lungs, the kidneys and all the vital organs are\r\ncontrolled by its agency.  Our organism is not a clockwork machine\r\nwhich once wound up will run of itself.  Its processes in all their\r\ncomplexity are supervised by mind.  It is not the intellect, however,\r\nwhich does this work, but the Unconscious.  The intellect still stands\r\naghast before the problem of the human body, lost like Pascal in the\r\nprofundities of analysis, each discovery only revealing new depths of\r\nmystery.  But the Unconscious seems to be familiar with it in every\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\nIt may be added that the Unconscious never sleeps; during the sleep of\r\nthe conscious it seems to be more vigilant than during our waking hours.\r\n\r\nIn comparison with these, the powers of the conscious mind seem almost\r\ninsignificant.  Derived from the Unconscious during the process of\r\nevolution, the conscious is, as it were, the antechamber where the\r\ncrude energies of the Unconscious are selected and adapted for action\r\non the world outside us.  In the past we have unduly exaggerated the\r\nimportance of the conscious intellect.  To claim for it the discoveries\r\nof civilisation is to confuse the instrument with the agent, to\r\nattribute sight to the field-glass instead of to the eye behind it.\r\nThe value of the conscious mind must not be underrated, however.  It is\r\na machine of the greatest value, the seat of reason, the social\r\ninstincts and moral concepts.  But it _is_ a machine and not the\r\nengine, nor yet the engineer.  It provides neither material nor power.\r\nThese are furnished by the Unconscious.\r\n\r\nThese two strata of mental life are in perpetual interaction one with\r\nthe other.  Just as everything conscious has its preliminary step in\r\nthe Unconscious, so every conscious thought passes down into the lower\r\nstratum and there becomes an element in our being, partaking of the\r\nUnconscious energy, and playing its part in supervising and determining\r\nour mental and bodily states.  If it is a healthful thought we are so\r\nmuch the better; if it is a diseased one we are so much the worse.  It\r\nis this transformation of a thought into an element of our life that we\r\ncall Autosuggestion.  Since this is a normal part of the mind's action\r\nwe shall have no difficulty in finding evidence of it in our daily\r\nexperiences.\r\n\r\nWalking down the street in a gloomy frame of mind you meet a buoyant,\r\ncheery acquaintance.  The mere sight of his genial smile acts on you\r\nlike a tonic, and when you have chatted with him for a few minutes your\r\ngloom has disappeared, giving place to cheerfulness and confidence.\r\nWhat has effected this change?--Nothing other than the idea in your own\r\nmind.  As you watched his face, listened to his good-natured voice,\r\nnoticed the play of his smile, your conscious mind was occupied by the\r\nidea of cheerfulness.  This idea on being transferred to the\r\nUnconscious became a reality, so that without any logical grounds you\r\nbecame cheerful.\r\n\r\nFew people, especially young people, are unacquainted with the effects\r\nproduced by hearing or reading ghost-stories.  You have spent the\r\nevening, let us say, at a friend's house, listening to terrifying tales\r\nof apparitions.  At a late hour you leave the fireside circle to make\r\nyour way home.  The states of fear imaged before your mind have\r\nrealised themselves in your Unconscious.  You tread gingerly in the\r\ndark places, hurry past the churchyard and feel a distinct relief when\r\nthe lights of home come into view.  It is the old road you have so\r\noften traversed with perfect equanimity, but its cheerful associations\r\nare overlooked and the commonest objects tinged with the colour of your\r\nsubjective states.  Autosuggestion cannot change a post into a spectre,\r\nbut if you are very impressionable it will so distort your sensory\r\nimpressions that common sounds seem charged with supernatural\r\nsignificance and every-day objects take on terrifying shapes.\r\n\r\nIn each of the above examples the idea of a mental state--cheerfulness\r\nor fear--was presented to the mind.  The idea on reaching the\r\nUnconscious became a reality; that is to say, you actually became\r\ncheerful or frightened.\r\n\r\nThe same process is much easier to recognise where the resultant is not\r\na mental but a bodily state.\r\n\r\nOne often meets people who take a delight in describing with a wealth\r\nof detail the disorders with which they or their friends are afflicted.\r\nA sensitive person is condemned by social usage to listen to a\r\nharrowing account of some grave malady.  As detail succeeds detail the\r\nlistener feels a chilly discomfort stealing over him.  He turns pale,\r\nbreaks into a cold perspiration, and is aware of an unpleasant\r\nsensation at the pit of the stomach.  Sometimes, generally where the\r\nlistener is a child, actual vomiting or a fainting fit may ensue.\r\nThese effects are undeniably physical; to produce them the organic\r\nprocesses must have been sensibly disturbed.  Yet their cause lies\r\nentirely in the idea of illness, which, ruthlessly impressed upon the\r\nmind, realises itself in the Unconscious.\r\n\r\nThis effect may be so precise as to reproduce the actual symptoms of\r\nthe disease described.  Medical students engaged in the study of some\r\nparticular malady frequently develop its characteristic symptoms.\r\n\r\nEveryone is acquainted with the experience known as \"stage fright.\"\r\nThe victim may be a normal person, healthy both in mind and body.  He\r\nmay possess in private life a good voice, a mind fertile in ideas and a\r\ngift of fluent expression.  He may know quite surely that his audience\r\nis friendly and sympathetic to the ideas he wishes to unfold.  But let\r\nhim mount the steps of a platform.  Immediately his knees begin to\r\ntremble and his heart to palpitate; his mind becomes a blank or a\r\nchaos, his tongue and lips refuse to frame coherent sounds, and after a\r\nfew stammerings he is forced to make a ludicrous withdrawal.  The cause\r\nof this baffling experience lay in the thoughts which occupied the\r\nsubject's mind before his public appearance.  He was afraid of making\r\nhimself ridiculous.  He expected to feel uncomfortable, feared that he\r\nwould forget his speech or be unable to express himself.  These\r\nnegative ideas, penetrating to the Unconscious, realised themselves and\r\nprecisely what he feared took place.\r\n\r\nIf you live in a town you have probably seen people who, in carelessly\r\ncrossing the street, find themselves in danger of being run down by a\r\nvehicle.  In this position they sometimes stand for an appreciable time\r\n\"rooted,\" as we say, \"to the spot.\"  This is because the danger seems\r\nso close that they imagine themselves powerless to elude it.  As soon\r\nas this idea gives place to that of escape they get out of the way as\r\nfast as they can.  If their first idea persisted, however, the actual\r\npowerlessness resulting from it would likewise persist, and unless the\r\nvehicle stopped or turned aside they would infallibly be run over.\r\n\r\nOne occasionally meets people suffering from a nervous complaint known\r\nas St. Vitus' Dance.  They have a disconcerting habit of contorting\r\ntheir faces, screwing round their necks or twitching their shoulders.\r\nIt is a well known fact that those who come into close contact with\r\nthem, living in the same house or working in the same office, are\r\nliable to contract the same habit, often performing the action without\r\nthemselves being aware of it.  This is due to the operation of the same\r\nlaw.  The idea of the habit, being repeatedly presented to their minds,\r\nrealises itself, and they begin to perform a similar movement in their\r\nown persons.\r\n\r\nExamples of this law present themselves at every turn.  Have you ever\r\nasked yourself why some people faint at the sight of blood, or why most\r\nof us turn giddy when we look down from a great height?\r\n\r\nIf we turn to the sufferers from neurosis we find some who have lost\r\ntheir powers of speech or of vision; some, like the blacksmith we saw\r\nin Coué's clinic, who have lost the use of their limbs; others\r\nsuffering from a functional disturbance of one of the vital organs.\r\nThe cause in each case is nothing more tangible than an idea which has\r\nbecome realised in the Unconscious mind.\r\n\r\nThese instances show clearly enough that the thoughts we think do\r\nactually become realities in the Unconscious.  But is this a universal\r\nlaw, operating in every life, or merely something contingent and\r\noccasional?  Sometimes irrelevant cheerfulness seems only to make\r\ndespondency more deep.  Certain types of individual are only irritated\r\nby the performance of a stage comedy.  Physicians listen to the\r\ncircumstantial accounts of their patients' ailments without being in\r\nthe least upset.  These facts seem at first sight at variance with the\r\nrule.  But they are only apparent exceptions which serve to test and\r\nverify it.  The physical or mental effect invariably corresponds with\r\nthe idea present in the mind, but this need not be identical with the\r\nthought communicated from without.  Sometimes a judgment interposes\r\nitself, or it may be that the idea calls up an associated idea which\r\npossesses greater vitality and therefore dislodges it.  A gloomy person\r\nwho meets a cheerful acquaintance may mentally contrast himself with\r\nthe latter, setting his own troubles beside the other's good fortune,\r\nhis own grounds for sadness beside the other's grounds for\r\nsatisfaction.  Thus the idea of his own unhappiness is strengthened and\r\nsinking into the Unconscious makes still deeper the despondency he\r\nexperienced before.  In the same way the doctor, listening to the\r\nsymptoms of a patient, does not allow these distressful ideas to dwell\r\nin his conscious mind.  His thought passes on immediately to the\r\nremedy, to the idea of the help he must give.  Not only does he\r\nmanifest this helpfulness in reasoned action, but also, by Unconscious\r\nrealisation, in his very bearing and manner.  Or his mind may be\r\nconcentrated on the scientific bearings of the case, so that he will\r\ninvoluntarily treat the patient as a specimen on which to pursue his\r\nresearches.  The steeplejack experiences no giddiness or fear in\r\nscaling a church spire because the thought of danger is immediately\r\nreplaced by the knowledge of his own clear head and sure foot.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to a point which is of great practical importance in the\r\nperformance of curative autosuggestion.  No idea presented to the mind\r\ncan realise itself unless the mind accepts it.\r\n\r\nMost of the errors made hitherto in this field have been due to the\r\nneglect of this fundamental fact.  If a patient is suffering from\r\nsevere toothache it is not of the slightest use to say to him: \"You\r\nhave no pain.\"  The statement is so grossly opposed to the fact that\r\n\"acceptation\" is impossible.  The patient will reject the suggestion,\r\naffirm the fact of his suffering, and so, by allowing his conscious\r\nmind to dwell on it, probably make it more intense.\r\n\r\nWe are now in a position to formulate the basic law of autosuggestion\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n_Every idea which enters the conscious mind, if it is accepted by the\r\nUnconscious, is transformed by it into a reality and forms henceforth a\r\npermanent element in our life_.\r\n\r\nThis is the process called \"Spontaneous Autosuggestion.\"  It is a law\r\nby which the mind of man has always worked, and by which all our minds\r\nare working daily.\r\n\r\nThe reader will see from the examples cited and from others which he\r\nwill constantly meet that the thoughts we think determine not only our\r\nmental states, our sentiments and emotions, but the delicate actions\r\nand adjustments of our physical bodies.  Trembling, palpitation,\r\nstammering, blushing--not to speak of the pathological states which\r\noccur in neurosis--are due to modifications and changes in the\r\nblood-flow, in muscular action and in the working of the vital organs.\r\nThese changes are not voluntary and conscious ones, they are determined\r\nby the Unconscious and come to us often with a shock of surprise.\r\n\r\nIt must be evident that if we fill our conscious minds with ideas of\r\nhealth, joy, goodness, efficiency, and can ensure their acceptation by\r\nthe Unconscious, these ideas too will become realities, capable of\r\nlifting us on to a new plane of being.  The difficulty which has\r\nhitherto so frequently brought these hopes to naught is that of\r\nensuring acceptation.  This will be treated in the next chapter.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, the whole process  of Autosuggestion consists of two steps:\r\n(1) The acceptation of an idea.  (2) Its transformation into a reality.\r\nBoth these operations are performed by the Unconscious.  Whether the\r\nidea is originated in the mind of the subject or is presented from\r\nwithout by the agency of another person is a matter of indifference.\r\nIn both cases it undergoes the same process: it is submitted to the\r\nUnconscious, accepted or rejected, and so either realised or ignored.\r\nThus the distinction between Autosuggestion and Heterosuggestion is\r\nseen to be both arbitrary and superficial.  In essentials all\r\nsuggestion is Autosuggestion.  The only distinction we need make is\r\nbetween Spontaneous Autosuggestion, which takes place independently of\r\nour will and choice, and Induced Autosuggestion, in which we\r\nconsciously select the ideas we wish to realise and purposely convey\r\nthem to the Unconscious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHOUGHT AND THE WILL\r\n\r\nIf we can get the Unconscious to accept an idea, realisation follows\r\nautomatically.  The only difficulty which confronts us in the practice\r\nof Induced Autosuggestion is to ensure acceptation, and that is a\r\ndifficulty which no method prior to that of Emile Coué has\r\nsatisfactorily surmounted.\r\n\r\nEvery idea which enters the mind is charged, to a greater or less\r\nextent, with emotion.  This emotional charge may be imperceptible, as\r\nwith ideas to which we are indifferent, or it may be very great, as\r\nwhen the idea is closely related to our personal interests.  All the\r\nideas we are likely to make the subjects of Induced Autosuggestion are\r\nof the latter class, since they refer to health, energy, success or\r\nsome goal equally dear to our hearts.  The greater the degree of\r\nemotion accompanying an idea, the more potent is the autosuggestion\r\nresulting from it.  Thus a moment of violent fright may give rise to\r\neffects which last a lifetime.  This emotional factor also plays a\r\nlarge part in securing acceptation.\r\n\r\nSo far as one can see, the acceptation or rejection of an idea by the\r\nUnconscious depends on the associations with which it is connected.\r\nThus, an idea is accepted when it evokes similar ideas charged with\r\nemotion of the same quality.  It is rejected when it is associated with\r\ncontrary ideas, which are, therefore, contrary in their emotional\r\ncharge.  In the latter case, the original idea is neutralised by its\r\nassociations, somewhat in the same way as an acid is neutralised by an\r\nalkali.  An example will serve to make this clearer.\r\n\r\nYou are on a cross-channel boat on a roughish passage.  You go up to a\r\nsailor and say to him in a sympathetic tone: \"My dear fellow, you're\r\nlooking very ill.  Aren't you going to be sea-sick?\"  According to his\r\ntemperament he either laughs at your \"joke\" or expresses a pardonable\r\nirritation.  But he does not become sick because the associations\r\ncalled up are contrary ones.  Sea-sickness is associated in his mind\r\nwith his own immunity from it, and therefore evokes not fear but\r\nself-confidence.  Pursuing your somewhat inhumane experiment you\r\napproach a timid-looking passenger.  \"My dear sir, how ill you look!  I\r\nfeel sure you are going to be sea-sick.  Let me help you down below.\"\r\nHe turns pale.  The word \"sea-sickness\" associates itself with his own\r\nfears and forebodings.  He accepts your aid down to his berth and there\r\nthe pernicious autosuggestion is realised.  In the first case the idea\r\nwas refused, because it was overwhelmed by a contrary association; in\r\nthe second the Unconscious accepted it, since it was reinforced by\r\nsimilar ideas from within.\r\n\r\nBut supposing to a sick mind, permeated with thoughts of disease, a\r\nthought of health is presented.  How can we avoid the malassociation\r\nwhich tends to neutralise it?\r\n\r\nWe can think of the Unconscious as a tide which ebbs and flows.  In\r\nsleep it seems to submerge the conscious altogether, while at our\r\nmoments of full wakefulness, when the attention and will are both at\r\nwork, the tide is at its lowest ebb.  Between these two extremes are\r\nany number of intermediary levels.  When we are drowsy, dreamy, lulled\r\ninto a gentle reverie by music or by a picture or a poem, the\r\nUnconscious tide is high; the more wakeful and alert we become the\r\nlower it sinks.  This submersion of the conscious mind is called by\r\nBaudouin the \"Outcropping of the Subconscious.\"  The highest degree of\r\noutcropping, compatible with the conscious direction of our thoughts,\r\noccurs just before we fall asleep and just after we wake.\r\n\r\nIt is fairly obvious that the greater the outcropping the more\r\naccessible these dynamic strata of the mind become, and the easier it\r\nis to implant there any idea we wish to realise.\r\n\r\nAs the Unconscious tide rises the active levels of the mind are\r\noverflowed; thought is released from its task of serving our conscious\r\naims in the real world of matter, and moves among the more primal\r\nwishes and desires which people the Unconscious, like a diver walking\r\nthe strange world beneath the sea.  But the laws by which thought is\r\ngoverned on this sub-surface level are not those of our ordinary waking\r\nconsciousness.  During outcropping association by contraries does not\r\nseem readily to take place.  Thus the mal-association, which\r\nneutralised the desired idea and so prevented acceptation, no longer\r\npresents itself.  We all know what happens during a \"day-dream\" or\r\n\"brown-study,\" when the Unconscious tide is high.  A succession of\r\nbright images glides smoothly through the mind.  The original thought\r\nspins itself on and on; no obstacles seem to stop it, no questions of\r\nprobability arise; we are cut off from the actual conditions of life\r\nand live in a world where all things are possible.  These day-dreams\r\ncause very potent autosuggestions, and one should take care that they\r\nare wholesome and innocent; but the important point is that on this\r\nlevel of consciousness association seems to operate by similarity, and\r\nemotion is comparatively intense.  These conditions are highly\r\nfavourable to acceptation.\r\n\r\nIf, on getting into bed at night, we assume a comfortable posture,\r\nrelax our muscles and close our eyes, we fall naturally into a stage of\r\nsemi-consciousness akin to that of day-dreaming.  If now we introduce\r\ninto the mind any desired idea, it is freed from the inhibiting\r\nassociations of daily life, associates itself by similarity, and\r\nattracts emotion of the same quality as its own charge.  The\r\nUnconscious is thus caused to accept it, and inevitably it is turned\r\ninto an autosuggestion.  Every time we repeat this process the\r\nassociative power of the idea is increased, its emotional value grows\r\ngreater, and the autosuggestion resulting from it is more powerful.  By\r\nthis means we can induce the Unconscious to accept an idea, the normal\r\nassociations of which are contrary and unfavourable.  The person with a\r\ndisease-soaked mind can gradually implant ideas of health, filling his\r\nUnconscious daily with healing thoughts.  The instrument we use is\r\nThought, and the condition essential to success is that the conscious\r\nmind shall be lulled to rest.\r\n\r\nSystems which hitherto have tried to make use of autosuggestion have\r\nfailed to secure reliable results because they did not place their\r\nreliance on Thought, but tried to compel the Unconscious to accept an\r\nidea by exercising the Will.  Obviously, such attempts are doomed to\r\nfailure.  By using the will we automatically wake ourselves up,\r\nsuppress the encroaching tide of the Unconscious, and thereby destroy\r\nthe condition by which alone we can succeed.\r\n\r\nIt is worth our while to note more closely how this happens.  A\r\nsufferer, whose mind is filled with thoughts of ill-health, sits down\r\nto compel himself to accept a good suggestion.  He calls up a thought\r\nof health and makes an effort of the will to impress it on the\r\nUnconscious.  This effort restores him to full wakefulness and so\r\nevokes the customary association--disease.  Consequently, he finds\r\nhimself contemplating the exact opposite of what he desired.  He\r\nsummons his will again and recalls the healthful thought, but since he\r\nis now wider awake than ever, association is even more rapid and\r\npowerful than before.  The disease-thought is now in full possession of\r\nhis mind and all the efforts of his will fail to dislodge it.  Indeed\r\nthe harder he struggles the more fully the evil thought possesses him.\r\n\r\nThis gives us a glimpse of the new and startling discovery to which\r\nCoué's uniform success is due; namely, that when the will is in\r\nconflict with an idea, the idea invariably gains the day.  This is\r\ntrue, of course, not only of Induced Autosuggestion, but also of the\r\nspontaneous suggestions which occur in daily life.  A few examples will\r\nmake this clear.\r\n\r\nMost of us know how, when we have some difficult duty to perform, a\r\nchance word of discouragement will dwell in the mind, eating away our\r\nself-confidence and attuning our minds to failure.  All the efforts of\r\nour will fail to throw it off; indeed, the more we struggle against it\r\nthe more we become obsessed with it.\r\n\r\nVery similar to this is the state of mind of the person suffering from\r\nstage-fright.  He is obsessed with ideas of failure and all the efforts\r\nof his will are powerless to overcome them.  Indeed, it is the state of\r\neffort and tension which makes his discomfiture so complete.\r\n\r\nSport offers many examples of the working of this law.\r\n\r\nA tennis-player is engaged to play in an important match.  He wishes,\r\nof course, to win, but fears that he will lose.  Even before the day of\r\nthe game his fears begin to realise themselves.  He is nervy and \"out\r\nof sorts.\"  In fact, the Unconscious is creating the conditions best\r\nsuited to realise the thought in his mind--failure.  When the game\r\nbegins his skill seems to have deserted him.  He summons the resources\r\nof his will and tries to compel himself to play well, straining every\r\nnerve to recapture the old dexterity.  But all his efforts only make\r\nhim play worse and worse.  The harder he tries the more signally he\r\nfails.  The energy he calls up obeys not his will but the idea in his\r\nmind, not the desire to win but the dominant thought of failure.\r\n\r\nThe fatal attraction of the bunker for the nervous golfer is due to the\r\nsame cause.  With his mind's eye he sees his ball alighting in the most\r\nunfavourable spot.  He may use any club he likes, he may make a long\r\ndrive or a short; as long as the thought of the bunker dominates his\r\nmind, the ball will inevitably find its way into it.  The more he calls\r\non his will to help him, the worse his plight is likely to be.  Success\r\nis not gained by effort but by right thinking.  The champion golfer or\r\ntennis-player is not a person of herculean frame and immense\r\nwill-power.  His whole life has been dominated by the thought of\r\nsuccess in the game at which he excels.\r\n\r\nYoung persons sitting for an examination sometimes undergo this painful\r\nexperience.  On reading through their papers they find that all their\r\nknowledge has suddenly deserted them.  Their mind is an appalling blank\r\nand not one relevant thought can they recall.  The more they grit their\r\nteeth and summon the powers of the will, the further the desired ideas\r\nflee.  But when they have left the examination-room and the tension\r\nrelaxes, the ideas they were seeking flow tantalisingly back into the\r\nmind.  Their forgetfulness was due to thoughts of failure previously\r\nnourished in the mind.  The application of the will only made the\r\ndisaster more complete.\r\n\r\nThis explains the baffling experience of the drug-taker, the drunkard,\r\nthe victim of some vicious craving.  His mind is obsessed by the desire\r\nfor satisfaction.  The efforts of the will to restrain it only make it\r\nmore overmastering.  Repeated failures convince him at length that he\r\nis powerless to control himself, and this idea, operating as an\r\nautosuggestion, increases his impotence.  So in despair, he abandons\r\nhimself to his obsession, and his life ends in wreckage.\r\n\r\nWe can now see, not only that the Will is incapable of vanquishing a\r\nthought, but that as fast as the Will brings up its big guns, Thought\r\ncaptures them and turns them against it.\r\n\r\nThis truth, which Baudouin calls the Law of Reversed Effort, is thus\r\nstated by Coué:\r\n\r\n\"_When the Imagination and the Will are in conflict the Imagination\r\ninvariably gains the day._\"\r\n\r\n\"_In the conflict between the Will and the Imagination, the force of\r\nthe Imagination is in direct ratio to the square of the Will._\"\r\n\r\nThe mathematical terms are used, of course, only metaphorically.\r\n\r\nThus the Will turns out to be, not the commanding monarch of life, as\r\nmany people would have it, but a blind Samson, capable either of\r\nturning the mill or of pulling down the pillars.\r\n\r\nAutosuggestion succeeds by avoiding conflict.  It replaces wrong\r\nthought by right, literally applying in the sphere of science the\r\nprinciple enunciated in the New Testament: \"Resist not evil, but\r\novercome evil with good.\"\r\n\r\nThis doctrine is in no sense a negation of the will.  It simply puts it\r\nin its right place, subordinates it to a higher power.  A moment's\r\nreflection will suffice to show that the will cannot be more than the\r\nservant of thought.  We are incapable of exercising the will unless the\r\nimagination has first furnished it with a goal.  We cannot simply will,\r\nwe must will _something_, and that something exists in our minds as an\r\nidea.  The will acts rightly when it is in harmony with the idea in the\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nBut what happens when, in the smooth execution of our idea, we are\r\nconfronted with an obstacle?  This obstacle may exist outside us, as\r\ndid the golfer's bunker, but it must also exist as an idea in our minds\r\nor we should not be aware of it.\r\n\r\nAs long as we allow this mental image to stay there, the efforts of our\r\nwill to overcome it only make it more irresistible.  We run our heads\r\nagainst it like a goat butting a brick wall.  Indeed, in this way we\r\ncan magnify the smallest difficulty until it becomes insurmountable--we\r\ncan make mole-hills into mountains.  This is precisely what the\r\nneurasthenic does.  The idea of a difficulty dwells unchanged in his\r\nmind, and all his efforts to overcome it only increase its dimensions,\r\nuntil it overpowers him and he faints in the effort to cross a street.\r\n\r\nBut as soon as we change the idea our troubles vanish.  By means of the\r\nintellect we can substitute for the blank idea of the obstacle that of\r\nthe means to overcome it.  Immediately, the will is brought into\r\nharmony again with thought, and we go forward to the triumphant\r\nattainment of our end.  It may be that the means adopted consist of a\r\nfrontal attack, the overcoming of an obstacle by force.  But before we\r\nbring this force into play, the mind must have approved it--must have\r\nentertained the idea of its probable success.  We must, in fact, have\r\nthought of the obstacle as already smashed down and flattened out by\r\nour attack.  Otherwise, we should involve ourselves in the conflict\r\ndepicted above, and our force would be exhausted in a futile internal\r\nbattle.  In a frontal attack against an obstacle we use effort, and\r\neffort, to be effective, must be approved by the reason and preceded,\r\nto some extent, by the idea of success.\r\n\r\nThus, even in our dealings with the outside world, Thought is always\r\nmaster of the will.  How much more so when our action is turned inward!\r\nWhen practising autosuggestion we are living in the mind, where\r\nthoughts are the only realities.  We can meet with no obstacle other\r\nthan that of Thought itself.  Obviously then, the frontal attack, the\r\nexertion of effort, can never be admissible, for it sets the will and\r\nthe thought at once in opposition.  The turning of our thoughts from\r\nthe mere recognition of an obstacle to the idea of the means to\r\novercome it, is no longer a preliminary, as in the case of outward\r\naction.  In itself it clears away the obstacle.  By procuring the right\r\nidea our end is already attained.\r\n\r\nIn applying effort during the practice of Induced Autosuggestion, we\r\nuse in the world of mind an instrument fashioned for use in the world\r\nof matter.  It is as if we tried to solve a mathematical problem by\r\nmauling the book with a tin-opener.\r\n\r\nFor two reasons then, effort must never be allowed to intrude during\r\nthe practice of autosuggestion: first because it wakes us up and so\r\nsuppresses the tide of the Unconscious, secondly because it causes\r\nconflict between Thought and the will.\r\n\r\nOne other interesting fact emerges from an examination of the foregoing\r\nexamples.  In each case we find that the idea which occupied the mind\r\nwas of a final state, an accomplished fact.  The golfer was thinking of\r\nhis ball dropping into the bunker, the tennis-player of his defeat, the\r\nexaminee of his failure.  In each case the Unconscious realised the\r\nthought in its own way, chose inevitably the means best suited to\r\narrive at its end--the realisation of the idea.  In the case of the\r\ngolfer the most delicate physical adjustments were necessary.  Stance,\r\ngrip and swing all contributed their quota, but these physical\r\nadjustments were performed unconsciously, the conscious mind being\r\nunaware of them.  From this we see that we need not suggest the way in\r\nwhich our aim is to be accomplished.  If we fill our minds with the\r\nthought of the desired end, provided that end is possible, the\r\nUnconscious will lead us to it by the easiest, most direct path.\r\n\r\nHere we catch a glimpse of the truth behind what is called \"luck.\"  We\r\nare told that everything comes to him who waits, and this is literally\r\ntrue, provided he waits in the right frame of mind.  Some men are\r\nnotoriously lucky in business; whatever they touch seems to \"turn to\r\ngold.\"  The secret of their success lies in the fact that they\r\nconfidently expect to succeed.  There is no need to go so far as the\r\nwriters of the school of \"New Thought,\" and claim that suggestion can\r\nset in motion transcendental laws outside man's own nature.  It is\r\nquite clear that the man who expects success, of whatever kind it may\r\nbe, will unconsciously take up the right attitude to his environment;\r\nwill involuntarily close with fleeting opportunity, and by his inner\r\nfitness command the circumstances without.\r\n\r\nMan has often been likened to a ship navigating the seas of life.  Of\r\nthat ship the engine is the will and Thought is the helm.  If we are\r\nbeing directed out of our true course it is worse than useless to call\r\nfor full steam ahead; our only hope lies in changing the direction of\r\nthe helm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTHE PRACTICE OF AUTOSUGGESTION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nGENERAL RULES\r\n\r\nWith our knowledge of the powerful effect which an idea produces, we\r\nshall see the importance of exercising a more careful censorship over\r\nthe thoughts which enter our minds.  Thought is the legislative power\r\nin our lives, just as the will is the executive.  We should not think\r\nit wise to permit the inmates of prisons and asylums to occupy the\r\nlegislative posts in the state, yet when we harbour ideas of passion\r\nand disease, we allow the criminals and lunatics of thought to usurp\r\nthe governing power in the commonwealth of our being.\r\n\r\nIn future, then, we shall seek ideas of health, success, and goodness;\r\nwe shall treat warily all depressing subjects of conversation, the\r\ndaily list of crimes and disasters which fill the newspapers, and those\r\nnovels, plays and films which harrow our feelings, without transmuting\r\nby the magic of art the sadness into beauty.\r\n\r\nThis does not mean that we should be always self-consciously studying\r\nourselves, ready to nip the pernicious idea in the bud; nor yet that we\r\nshould adopt the ostrich's policy of sticking our heads in the sand and\r\ndeclaring that disease and evil have no real existence.  The one leads\r\nto egotism and the other to callousness.  Duty sometimes requires us to\r\ngive our attention to things in themselves evil and depressing.  The\r\ndemands of friendship and human sympathy are imperious, and we cannot\r\nignore them without moral loss.  But there is a positive and a negative\r\nway of approaching such subjects.\r\n\r\nSympathy is too often regarded as a passive process by which we allow\r\nourselves to be infected by the gloom, the weakness, the mental\r\nill-health of other people.  This is sympathy perverted.  If a friend\r\nis suffering from small-pox or scarlet fever you do not seek to prove\r\nyour sympathy by infecting yourself with his disease.  You would\r\nrecognize this to be a crime against the community.  Yet many people\r\nsubmit themselves to infection by unhealthy ideas as if it were an act\r\nof charity--part of their duty towards their neighbours.  In the same\r\nway people deliver their minds to harrowing stories of famine and\r\npestilence, as if the mental depression thus produced were of some\r\nvalue to the far-away victims.  This is obviously false--the only\r\nresult is to cause gloom and ill-health in the reader and so make him a\r\nburden to his family.  That such disasters should be known is beyond\r\nquestion, but we should react to them in the manner indicated in the\r\nlast chapter.  We should replace the blank recognition of the evil by\r\nthe quest of the means best suited to overcome it; then we can look\r\nforward to an inspiring end and place the powers of our will in the\r\nservice of its attainment.\r\n\r\n  Oh, human soul, as long as thou canst so,\r\n  Set up a mark of everlasting light\r\n  Above the heaving senses' ebb and flow ...\r\n  Not with lost toil thou labourest through the night,\r\n  Thou mak'st the heaven thou hop'st indeed thy home.\r\n\r\n\r\nAutosuggestion, far from producing callousness, dictates the method and\r\nsupplies the means by which the truest sympathy can be practised.  In\r\nevery case our aim must be to remove the suffering as soon as possible,\r\nand this is facilitated by refusing acceptation to the bad ideas and\r\nmaintaining our own mental and moral balance.\r\n\r\nWhenever gloomy thoughts come to us, whether from without or within, we\r\nshould quietly transfer our attention to something brighter.  Even if\r\nwe are afflicted by some actual malady, we should keep our thought from\r\nresting on it as far as we have the power to do so.  An organic disease\r\nmay be increased a hundredfold by allowing the mind to brood on it, for\r\nin so doing we place at its disposal all the resources of our organism,\r\nand direct our life-force to our own destruction.  On the other hand,\r\nby denying it our attention and opposing it with curative\r\nautosuggestions, we reduce its power to the minimum and should succeed\r\nin overcoming it entirely.  Even in the most serious organic diseases\r\nthe element contributed by wrong thought is infinitely greater than\r\nthat which is purely physical.\r\n\r\nThere are times when temperamental failings, or the gravity of our\r\naffliction, places our imagination beyond our ordinary control.  The\r\nsuggestion operates in spite of us; we do not seem to possess the power\r\nto rid our minds of the adverse thought.  Under these conditions we\r\nshould never struggle to throw off the obsessing idea by force.  Our\r\nexertions only bring into play the law of reversed effort, and we\r\nflounder deeper into the slough.  Coué's technique, however, which will\r\nbe outlined in succeeding chapters, will give us the means of mastering\r\nourselves, even under the most trying conditions.\r\n\r\nOf all the destructive suggestions we must learn to shun, none is more\r\ndangerous than fear.  In fearing something the mind is not only\r\ndwelling on a negative idea, but it is establishing the closest\r\npersonal connection between the idea and ourselves.  Moreover, the idea\r\nis surrounded by an aura of emotion, which considerably intensifies its\r\neffect.  Fear combines every element necessary to give to an\r\nautosuggestion its maximum power.  But happily fear, too, is\r\nsusceptible to the controlling power of autosuggestion.  It is one of\r\nthe first things which a person cognisant of the means to be applied\r\nshould seek to eradicate from his mind.\r\n\r\nFor our own sakes, too, we should avoid dwelling on the faults and\r\nfrailties of our neighbours.  If ideas of selfishness, greed, vanity,\r\nare continually before our minds there is great danger that we shall\r\nsubconsciously accept them, and so realise them in our own character.\r\nThe petty gossip and backbiting, so common in a small town, produce the\r\nvery faults they seem to condemn.  But by allowing our minds to rest\r\nupon the virtues of our neighbours, we reproduce the same virtues in\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\nBut if we should avoid negative ideas for our own sakes, much more\r\nshould we do so for the sake of other people.  Gloomy and despondent\r\nmen and women are centres of mental contagion, damaging all with whom\r\nthey come in contact.  Sometimes such people seem involuntarily to\r\nexert themselves to quench the cheerfulness of brighter natures, as if\r\ntheir Unconscious strove to reduce all others to its own low level.\r\nBut even healthy, well-intentioned people scatter evil suggestions\r\nbroadcast, without the least suspicion of the harm they do.  Every time\r\nwe remark to an acquaintance that he is looking ill, we actually damage\r\nhis health; the effect may be extremely slight, but by repetition it\r\ngrows powerful.  A man who accepts in the course of a day fifteen or\r\ntwenty suggestions that he is ill, has gone a considerable part of the\r\nway towards actual illness.  Similarly, when we thoughtlessly\r\ncommiserate with a friend on the difficulty of his daily work, or\r\nrepresent it as irksome and uncongenial, we make it a little harder for\r\nhim to accomplish, and thereby slightly diminish his chances of success.\r\n\r\nIf we must supervise our speech in contact with adults, with children\r\nwe should exercise still greater foresight.  The child's Unconscious is\r\nfar more accessible than that of the adult; the selective power\r\nexercised by the conscious mind is much feebler, and consequently the\r\nimpressions received realise themselves with greater power.  These\r\nimpressions are the material from which the child's growing life is\r\nconstructed, and if we supply faulty material the resultant structure\r\nwill be unstable.  Yet the most attentive and well-meaning mothers are\r\nengaged daily in sowing the seeds of weakness in their children's\r\nminds.  The little ones are constantly told they will take cold, will\r\nbe sick, will fall down, or will suffer some other misfortune.  The\r\nmore delicate the child's health, the more likely it is to be subjected\r\nto adverse suggestions.  It is too often saturated with the idea of bad\r\nhealth, and comes to look on disease as the normal state of existence\r\nand health as exceptional.  The same is equally true of the child's\r\nmental and moral upbringing.  How often do foolish parents tell their\r\nchildren that they are naughty, disobedient, stupid, idle or vicious?\r\nIf these suggestions were accepted, which, thank Heaven, is not always\r\nthe case, the little ones would in very fact develop just these\r\nqualities.  But even when no word is spoken, a look or a gesture can\r\ninitiate an undesirable autosuggestion.  The same child, visited by two\r\nstrangers, will immediately make friends with the one and avoid the\r\nother.  Why is this?--Because the one carries with him a healthful\r\natmosphere, while the other sends out waves of irritability or gloom.\r\n\r\n\"Men imagine,\" says Emerson, \"that they communicate their virtue or\r\nvice only by overt actions, and do not see that virtue and vice emit a\r\nbreath every moment.\"\r\n\r\nWith children, above all, it is not sufficient to refrain from the\r\nexpression of negative ideas; we must avoid harbouring them altogether.\r\nUnless we possess a bright positive mind the suggestions derived from\r\nus will be of little value.\r\n\r\nThe idea is gaining ground that a great deal of what is called\r\nhereditary disease is transmitted from parent to child, not physically\r\nbut mentally--that is to say, by means of adverse suggestions\r\ncontinually renewed in the child's mind.  Thus if one of the parents\r\nhas a tendency to tuberculosis, the child often lives in an atmosphere\r\nladen with tuberculous thoughts.  The little one is continually advised\r\nto take care of its lungs, to keep its chest warm, to beware of colds,\r\netc., etc.  In other words, the idea is repeatedly presented to its\r\nmind that it possesses second-rate lungs.  The realisation of these\r\nideas, the actual production of pulmonary tuberculosis is thus almost\r\nassured.\r\n\r\nBut all this is no more than crystallised common-sense.  Everyone knows\r\nthat a cheerful mind suffuses health, while a gloomy one produces\r\nconditions favourable to disease.  \"A merry heart doeth good like a\r\nmedicine,\" says the writer of the Book of Proverbs, \"but a broken\r\nspirit drieth the bones.\"  But this knowledge, since it lacked a\r\nscientific basis, has never been systematically applied.  We have\r\nregarded our feelings far too much as _effects_ and not sufficiently as\r\n_causes_.  We are happy because we are well; we do not recognise that\r\nthe process will work equally well in the reverse direction--that we\r\nshall be well because we are happy.  Happiness is not only the result\r\nof our conditions of life; it is also the creator of those conditions.\r\nAutosuggestion lays weight upon this latter view.  Happiness must come\r\nfirst.  It is only when the mind is ordered, balanced, filled with the\r\nlight of sweet and joyous thought, that it can work with its maximum\r\nefficiency.  When we are habitually happy our powers and capabilities\r\ncome to their full blossom, and we are able to work with the utmost\r\neffect on the shaping of what lies without.\r\n\r\nHappiness, you say, cannot be ordered like a chop in a restaurant.\r\nLike love, its very essence is freedom.  This is true; but like love,\r\nit can be wooed and won.  It is a condition which everyone experiences\r\nat some time in life.  It is native to the mind.  By the systematic\r\npractice of Induced Autosuggestion we can make it, not a fleeting\r\nvisitant, but a regular tenant of the mind, which storms and stresses\r\nfrom without cannot dislodge.  This idea of the indwelling happiness,\r\ninwardly conditioned, is as ancient as thought.  By autosuggestion we\r\ncan realise it in our own lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE GENERAL FORMULA\r\n\r\nWe saw that an unskilled golfer, who imagines his ball is going to\r\nalight in a bunker, unconsciously performs just those physical\r\nmovements needful to realise his idea in the actual.  In realising this\r\nidea his Unconscious displays ingenuity and skill none the less\r\nadmirable because opposed to his desire.  From this and other examples\r\nwe concluded that if the mind dwells on the idea of an accomplished\r\nfact, a realised state, the Unconscious will produce this state.  If\r\nthis is true of our spontaneous autosuggestions it is equally true of\r\nthe self-induced ones.\r\n\r\nIt follows that if we consistently think of happiness we become happy;\r\nif we think of health we become healthy; if we think of goodness we\r\nbecome good.  Whatever thought we continually think, provided it is\r\nreasonable, tends to become an actual condition of our life.\r\n\r\nTraditionally we rely too much on the conscious mind.  If a man suffers\r\nfrom headaches he searches out, with the help of his physician, their\r\ncause; discovers whether they come from his eyes, his digestion or his\r\nnerves, and purchases the drugs best suited to repair the fault.  If he\r\nwishes to improve a bad memory he practises one of the various methods\r\nof memory-training.  If he is the victim of a pernicious habit he is\r\nleft to counter it by efforts of the will, which too often exhaust his\r\nstrength, undermine his self-respect, and only lead him deeper into the\r\nmire.  How simple in comparison is the method of Induced\r\nAutosuggestion!  He need merely think the end--a head free from pain, a\r\ngood memory, a mode of life in which his bad habit has no part, and\r\nthese states are gradually evolved without his being aware of the\r\noperation performed by the Unconscious.\r\n\r\nBut even so, if each individual difficulty required a fresh\r\ntreatment--one for the headache, one for the memory, one for the bad\r\nhabit and so on--then the time needful to practise autosuggestion would\r\nform a considerable part of our waking life.  Happily the researches of\r\nthe Nancy School have revealed a further simplification.  This is\r\nobtained by the use of a general formula which sets before the mind the\r\nidea of a daily improvement in every respect, mental, physical and\r\nmoral.\r\n\r\nIn the original French this formula runs as follows: \"Tous les jours, à\r\ntous points de vue, je vais de mieux en mieux.\"  The English version\r\nwhich Coué considers most satisfactory is this: \"_Day by day, in every\r\nway, I'm getting better and better_.\"  This is very easy to say, the\r\nyoungest child can understand it, and it possesses a rudimentary\r\nrhythm, which exerts a lulling effect on the mind and so aids in\r\ncalling up the Unconscious.  But if you are accustomed to any other\r\nversion, such as that recommended by the translators of Baudouin, it\r\nwould be better to continue to use it.  Religious minds who wish to\r\nassociate the formula with God's care and protection might do so after\r\nthis fashion: \"Day by day, in every way, by the help of God, I'm\r\ngetting better and better.\"  It is possible that the attention of the\r\nUnconscious will thus be turned to moral and spiritual improvements to\r\na greater extent than by the ordinary formula.\r\n\r\nBut this general formula possesses definite advantages other than mere\r\nterseness and convenience.  The Unconscious, in its character of\r\nsurveyor over our mental and physical functions, knows far better than\r\nthe conscious the precise failings and weaknesses which have the\r\ngreatest need of attention.  The general formula supplies it with a\r\nfund of healing, strengthening power, and leaves it to apply this at\r\nthe points where the need is most urgent.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of common experience that people's ideals of manhood and\r\nwomanhood vary considerably.  The hardened materialist pictures\r\nperfection solely in terms of wealth, the butterfly-woman wants little\r\nbut physical beauty, charm, and the qualities that attract.  The\r\nsensitive man is apt to depreciate the powers he possesses and\r\nexaggerate those he lacks; while his self-satisfied neighbour can see\r\nno good in any virtues but his own.  It is quite conceivable that a\r\nperson left free to determine the nature of his autosuggestions by the\r\nlight of his conscious desire might use this power to realise a quality\r\nnot in itself admirable, or even one which, judged by higher standards,\r\nappeared pernicious.  Even supposing that his choice was good he would\r\nbe in danger of over-developing a few characteristics to the detriment\r\nof others and so destroying the balance of his personality.  The use of\r\nthe general formula guards against this.  It saves a man in spite of\r\nhimself.  It avoids the pitfalls into which the conscious mind may lead\r\nus by appealing to a more competent authority.  Just as we leave the\r\ndistribution of our bodily food to the choice of the Unconscious, so we\r\nmay safely leave that of our mental food, our Induced Autosuggestions.\r\n\r\nThe fear that the universal use of this formula would have a\r\nstandardising effect, modifying its users to a uniform pattern, is\r\nunfounded.  A rigid system of particular suggestions might tend towards\r\nsuch a result, but the general formula leaves every mind free to unfold\r\nand develop in the manner most natural to itself.  The eternal\r\ndiversity of men's minds can only be increased by the free impulse thus\r\nadministered.\r\n\r\nWe have previously seen that the Unconscious tide rises to its highest\r\npoint compatible with conscious thought just before sleep and just\r\nafter awaking, and that the suggestions formulated then are almost\r\nassured acceptation.  It is these moments that we select for the\r\nrepetition of the formula.\r\n\r\nBut before we pass on to the precise method, a word of warning is\r\nnecessary.  Even the most superficial attempt to analyse intellectually\r\na living act is bound to make it appear complex and difficult.  So our\r\nconsideration of the processes of outcropping and acceptation has\r\ninevitably invested them with a false appearance of difficulty.\r\nAutosuggestion is above all things easy.  Its greatest enemy is effort.\r\nThe more simple and unforced the manner of its performance the more\r\npotently and profoundly it works.  This is shown by the fact that its\r\nmost remarkable results have been secured by children and by simple\r\nFrench peasants.\r\n\r\nIt is here that Coué's directions for the practice differ considerably\r\nfrom those of Baudouin.  Coué insists upon its easiness, Baudouin\r\ncomplicates it.  The four chapters devoted by the latter to\r\n\"relaxation,\" \"collection,\" \"contention,\" and \"concentration,\" produce\r\nin the reader an adverse suggestion of no mean power.  They leave the\r\nimpression that autosuggestion is a perplexing business which only the\r\ngreatest foresight and supervision can render successful.  Nothing\r\ncould be more calculated to throw the beginner off the track.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that Autosuggestion is a function of the mind which we\r\nspontaneously perform every day of our lives.  The more our induced\r\nautosuggestions approximate to this spontaneous prototype the more\r\npotent they are likely to be.  Baudouin warns us against the danger of\r\nsetting the intellect to do the work of intuition, yet this is\r\nprecisely what he himself does.  A patient trying by his rules to\r\nattain outcropping and implant therein an autosuggestion is so\r\nvigilantly attentive to what he is doing that outcropping is rendered\r\nalmost impossible.  These artificial aids are, in Coué's opinion, not\r\nonly unnecessary but hindersome.  Autosuggestion succeeds when\r\nConscious and Unconscious co-operate in the acceptance of an idea.\r\nCoué's long practice has shown that we must leave the Unconscious, as\r\nsenior partner in the concern, to bring about the right conditions in\r\nits own way.  The fussy attempts of the intellect to dictate the method\r\nof processes which lie outside its sphere will only produce conflict,\r\nand so condemn our attempt to failure.  The directions given here are\r\namply sufficient, if conscientiously applied, to secure the fullest\r\nbenefits of which the method is capable.\r\n\r\nTake a piece of string and tie in it twenty knots.  By this means you\r\ncan count with a minimum expenditure of attention, as a devout Catholic\r\ncounts his prayers on a rosary.  The number twenty has no intrinsic\r\nvirtue; it is merely adopted as a suitable round number.\r\n\r\nOn getting into bed close your eyes, relax your muscles and take up a\r\ncomfortable posture.  These are no more than the ordinary preliminaries\r\nof slumber.  Now repeat twenty times, counting by means of the knots,\r\nthe general formula: \"Day by day, in every way, I'm getting better and\r\nbetter.\"\r\n\r\nThe words should be uttered aloud; that is, loud enough to be audible\r\nto your own ears.  In this way the idea is reinforced by the movements\r\nof lips and tongue and by the auditory impressions conveyed through the\r\near.  Say it simply, without effort, like a child absently murmuring a\r\nnursery rhyme.  Thus you avoid an appeal to the critical faculties of\r\nthe conscious which would lessen the outcropping.  When you have got\r\nused to this exercise and can say it quite \"unself-consciously,\" begin\r\nto let your voice rise or fall--it does not matter which--on the phrase\r\n\"in every way.\"  This is perhaps the most important part of the\r\nformula, and is thus given a gentle emphasis.  But at first do not\r\nattempt this accentuation; it will only needlessly complicate and, by\r\nrequiring more conscious attention, may introduce effort.  Do not try\r\nto think of what you are saying.  On the contrary, let the mind wander\r\nwhither it will; if it rests on the formula all the better, if it\r\nstrays elsewhere do not recall it.  As long as your repetition does not\r\ncome to a full-stop your mind-wandering will be less disturbing than\r\nwould be the effort to recall your thoughts.\r\n\r\nBaudouin differs from Coué as to the manner in which the formula should\r\nbe repeated.  His advice is to say it \"piously,\" with all the words\r\nseparately stressed.  No doubt it has its value when thus spoken, but\r\nthe attitude of mind to which the word \"pious\" can be applied is\r\nunfortunately not habitual with everyone.  The average man in trying to\r\nbe \"pious\" might end by being merely artificial.  But the child still\r\nexists in the most mature of men.  The \"infantile\" mode of repeating\r\nthe formula puts one in touch with deep levels of the Unconscious where\r\nthe child-mind still survives.  Coué's remarkable successes have been\r\nobtained by this means, and Baudouin advances no cogent reason for\r\nchanging it.\r\n\r\nThese instructions no doubt fall somewhat short of our ideal of a\r\nthought entirely occupying the mind.  But they are sufficient for a\r\nbeginning.  The sovereign rule is to make no effort, and if this is\r\nobserved you will intuitively fall into the right attitude.  This\r\nprocess of Unconscious adaptation may be hastened by a simple\r\nsuggestion before beginning.  Say to yourself, \"I shall repeat the\r\nformula in such a manner as to secure its maximum effect.\"  This will\r\nbring about the required conditions much more effectively than any\r\nconscious exercise of thought.\r\n\r\nOn waking in the morning, before you rise, repeat the formula in\r\nexactly the same manner.\r\n\r\nIts regular repetition is the foundation stone of the Nancy method and\r\nshould never be neglected.  In times of health it may be regarded as an\r\nenvoy going before to clear the path of whatever evils may lurk in the\r\nfuture.  But we must look on it chiefly as an educator, as a means of\r\nleavening the mass of adverse spontaneous suggestions which clog the\r\nUnconscious and rob our lives of their true significance.\r\n\r\nSay it with faith.  When you have said it your conscious part of the\r\nprocess is completed.  Leave the Unconscious to do its work\r\nundisturbed.  Do not be anxious about it, continually scanning yourself\r\nfor signs of improvement.  The farmer does not turn over the clods\r\nevery morning to see if his seed is sprouting.  Once sown it is left\r\ntill the green blade appears.  So it should be with suggestion.  Sow\r\nthe seed, and be sure the Unconscious powers of the mind will bring it\r\nto fruition, and all the sooner if your conscious ego is content to let\r\nit rest.\r\n\r\n_Say it with faith_!  You can only rob Induced Autosuggestion of its\r\npower in one way--by believing that it is powerless.  If you believe\r\nthis it becomes ipso facto powerless for you.  The greater your faith\r\nthe more radical and the more rapid will be your results; though if you\r\nhave only sufficient faith to repeat the formula twenty times night and\r\nmorning the results will soon give you in your own person the proof you\r\ndesire, and facts and faith will go on mutually augmenting each other.\r\n\r\nFaith reposes on reason and must have its grounds.  What grounds can we\r\nadduce for faith in Induced Autosuggestion?  The examples of cures\r\nalready cited are outside your experience and you may be tempted to\r\npooh-pooh them.  The experiment of Chevreul's pendulum, however, will\r\nshow in a simple manner the power possessed by a thought to transform\r\nitself into an action.\r\n\r\nTake a piece of white paper and draw on it a circle of about five\r\ninches' radius.  Draw two diameters _AB_ and _CD_ at right angles to\r\neach other and intersecting at _O_.  The more distinctly the lines\r\nstand out the better--they should be thickly drawn in black ink.  Now\r\ntake a lead pencil or a light ruler and tie to one end a piece of\r\ncotton about eight inches long; to the lower end of the cotton fasten a\r\nheavy metal button, of the sort used on a soldier's tunic.  Place the\r\npaper on a table so that the diameter _AB_ seems to be horizontal and\r\n_CD_ to be vertical, thus:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autosuggestion diagram]\r\n\r\nStand upright before the table with your miniature fishing-rod held\r\nfirmly in both hands and the button suspended above the point _O_.\r\nTake care not to press the elbows nervously against the sides.\r\n\r\nLook at the line _AB_, think of it, follow it with your eyes from side\r\nto side.  Presently the button will begin to swing along the line you\r\nare thinking of.  The more your mind dwells easily upon the idea of the\r\nline the greater this swing becomes.  Your efforts to _try_ to hold the\r\npendulum still, by bringing into action the law of reversed effort,\r\nonly make its oscillations more pronounced.\r\n\r\nNow fix your eyes on the line _CD_.  The button will gradually change\r\nthe direction of its movement, taking up that of _CD_.  When you have\r\nallowed it to swing thus for a few moments transfer your attention to\r\nthe circle, follow the circumference round and round with your eyes.\r\nOnce more the swinging button will follow you, adopting either a\r\nclock-wise or a counter clock-wise direction according to your thought.\r\nAfter a little practice you should produce a circular swing with a\r\ndiameter of at least eight inches; but your success will be directly\r\nproportional to the exclusiveness of your thought and to your efforts\r\nto hold the pencil still.\r\n\r\nLastly think of the point _O_.  Gradually the radius of the swing will\r\ndiminish until the button comes to rest.\r\n\r\nIs it necessary to point out how these movements are caused?  Your\r\nthought of the line, passing into the Unconscious, is there realised,\r\nso that _without knowing it_ you execute with your hands the\r\nimperceptible movements which set the button in motion.  The\r\nUnconscious automatically realises your thought through the nerves and\r\nmuscles of your arms and hands.  What is this but Induced\r\nAutosuggestion?\r\n\r\nThe first time you perform this little experiment it is best to be\r\nalone.  This enables you to approach it quite objectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nPARTICULAR SUGGESTIONS\r\n\r\nThe use of particular suggestions outlined in this chapter is of minor\r\nimportance compared with that of the general formula--\"Day by day, in\r\nevery way, I'm getting better and better.\"  The more deeply Coué\r\npursues his investigations, the more fully he becomes convinced that\r\nall else is secondary to this.  It is not difficult to make a guess as\r\nto why this should be.  In the general formula the attention is fully\r\nabsorbed by the idea of betterment.  The mind is directed away from all\r\nthat hinders and impedes and fixed on a positive goal.  In formulating\r\nparticular suggestions, however, we are always skating on the thin ice\r\nround our faults and ailments, always touching on subjects which have\r\nthe most painful associations.  So that our ideas have not the same\r\ncreative positiveness.  However that may be, it is a matter of\r\nexperience that the general formula is the basis of the whole method,\r\nand that all else is merely an adjuvant, an auxiliary--useful, but\r\ninessential to the main object.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that a partial outcropping of the Unconscious takes place\r\nwhenever we relax our mental and physical control, and let the mind\r\nwander; in popular language, when we fall into a \"brown study\" or a\r\n\"day-dream.\"  This outcropping should be sought before the special\r\nsuggestions are formulated.\r\n\r\nBut again we must beware of making simple things seem hard.  Baudouin\r\nwould have us perform a number of elaborate preparatives, which,\r\nhowever valuable to the student of psychology, serve with the layman\r\nonly to distract the mind, and by fixing the attention on the mechanism\r\nimpair the power of the creative idea.  Moreover, they cause the\r\nsubject to exert efforts to attain a state the very essence of which is\r\neffortlessness, like the victim of insomnia who \"tries his hardest\" to\r\nfall asleep.\r\n\r\nIn order to formulate particular suggestions, go to a room where you\r\nwill be free from interruption, sit down in a comfortable chair, close\r\nyour eyes, and let your muscles relax.  In other words, act precisely\r\nas if you were going to take a siesta.  In doing so you allow the\r\nUnconscious tide to rise to a sufficient height to make your particular\r\nsuggestions effective.  Now call up the desired ideas through the\r\nmedium of speech.  Tell yourself that such and such ameliorations are\r\ngoing to occur.\r\n\r\nBut here we must give a few hints as to the _form_ these suggestions\r\nshould take.\r\n\r\nWe should never set our faith a greater task than it can accomplish.  A\r\npatient suffering from deafness would be ill-advised to make the\r\nsuggestion: \"I can hear perfectly.\"  In the partial state of\r\noutcropping association is not entirely cut off, and such an idea would\r\ncertainly call up its contrary.  Thus we should initiate a suggestion\r\nantagonistic to the one we desired.  In this way we only court\r\ndisappointment and by losing faith in our instrument rob it of its\r\nefficacy.\r\n\r\nFurther, we should avoid as far as possible all mention of the ailment\r\nor difficulty against which the suggestion is aimed.  Indeed, our own\r\nattention should be directed not so much to getting rid of wrong\r\nconditions as to cultivating the opposite right ones in their place.\r\nIf you are inclined to be neurasthenic your mind is frequently occupied\r\nwith fear.  This fear haunts you because some thwarted element in your\r\npersonality, surviving in the Unconscious, gains through it a perverse\r\nsatisfaction.  In other words, your Unconscious enjoys the morbid\r\nemotional condition which fear brings with it.  Should you succeed in\r\nbanishing your fears you would probably feel dissatisfied, life would\r\nseem empty.  The old ideas would beckon you with promises, not of\r\nhappiness truly, but of emotion and excitement.  But if your\r\nsuggestions take a positive form, if you fill your mind with thoughts\r\nof self-confidence, courage, outward activity, and interest in the\r\nglowing and vital things of life, the morbid ideas will be turned out\r\nof doors and there will be no vacant spot to which they can return.\r\n\r\nWhatever the disorder may be, we should refer to it as little as\r\npossible, letting the whole attention go out to the contrary state of\r\nhealth.  We must dwell on the \"Yes-idea,\" affirming with faith the\r\nrealisation of our hopes, seeing ourselves endowed with the triumphant\r\nqualities we lack.  For a similar reason we should never employ a form\r\nof words which connotes doubt.  The phrases, \"I should like to,\" \"I am\r\ngoing to try,\" if realised by the Unconscious, can only produce a state\r\nof longing or desire, very different from the actual physical and\r\nmental modifications we are seeking.\r\n\r\nFinally, we should not speak of the desired improvement entirely as a\r\nthing of the future.  We should affirm that the change has already\r\nbegun, and will continue to operate more and more rapidly until our end\r\nis fully attained.\r\n\r\nHere are a few examples of special suggestions which may prove useful.\r\n\r\nFor deafness: Having closed the eyes and relaxed body and mind, say to\r\nyourself something of this nature: \"From this day forth my hearing will\r\ngradually improve.  Each day I shall hear a little better.  Gradually\r\nthis improvement will become more and more rapid until, in a\r\ncomparatively short space of time, I shall hear quite well and I shall\r\ncontinue to do so until the end of my life.\"\r\n\r\nA person suffering from unfounded fears and forebodings might proceed\r\nas follows: \"From to-day onward I shall become more and more conscious\r\nof all that is happy, positive and cheerful.  The thoughts which enter\r\nmy mind will be strong and healthful ones.  I shall gain daily in\r\nself-confidence, shall believe in my own powers, which indeed at the\r\nsame time will manifest themselves in greater strength.  My life is\r\ngrowing smoother, easier, brighter.  These changes become from day to\r\nday more profound; in a short space of time I shall have risen to a new\r\nplane of life, and all the troubles which used to perplex me will have\r\nvanished and will never return.\"\r\n\r\nA bad memory might be treated in some such terms as these: \"My memory\r\nfrom to-day on will improve in every department.  The impressions\r\nreceived will be clearer and more definite; I shall retain them\r\nautomatically and without any effort on my part, and when I wish to\r\nrecall them they will immediately present themselves in their correct\r\nform to my mind.  This improvement will be accomplished rapidly, and\r\nvery soon my memory will be better than it has ever been before.\"\r\n\r\nIrritability and bad temper are very susceptible to autosuggestion and\r\nmight be thus treated: \"Henceforth I shall daily grow more\r\ngood-humoured.  Equanimity and cheerfulness will become my normal\r\nstates of mind, and in a short time all the little happenings of life\r\nwill be received in this spirit.  I shall be a centre of cheer and\r\nhelpfulness to those about me, infecting them with my own good humour,\r\nand this cheerful mood will become so habitual that nothing can rob me\r\nof it.\"\r\n\r\nAsthma is a disease which has always baffled and still baffles the\r\nordinary methods of medicine.  It has shown itself, however, in Coué's\r\nexperience, pre-eminently susceptible to autosuggestive treatment.\r\nParticular suggestions for its removal might take this form: \"From this\r\nday forward my breathing will become rapidly easier.  Quite without my\r\nknowledge, and without any effort on my part, my organism will do all\r\nthat is necessary to restore perfect health to my lungs and bronchial\r\npassages.  I shall be able to undergo any exertion without\r\ninconvenience.  My breathing will be free, deep, delightful.  I shall\r\ndraw in all the pure health-giving air I need, and thus my whole system\r\nwill be invigorated and strengthened.  Moreover, I shall sleep calmly\r\nand peacefully, with the maximum of refreshment and repose, so that I\r\nawake cheerful and looking forward with pleasure to the day's tasks.\r\nThis process has this day begun and in a short time I shall be wholly\r\nand permanently restored to health.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that each of these suggestions comprises three\r\nstages: (1) Immediate commencement of the amelioration.  (2) Rapid\r\nprogress.  (3) Complete and permanent cure.  While this scheme is not\r\nessential, it is a convenient one and should be utilised whenever\r\napplicable.  The examples are framed as the first autosuggestions of\r\npersons new to the method.  On succeeding occasions the phrase \"from\r\nthis day forth,\" or its variants, should be replaced by a statement\r\nthat the amelioration has already begun.  Thus, in the case of the\r\nasthmatic, \"My breathing is already becoming easier,\" etc.\r\n\r\nParticular suggestions, though subsidiary in value to the general\r\nformula, are at times of very great service.  The general formula looks\r\nafter the foundations of our life, building in the depths where eye\r\ncannot see or ear hear.  Particular suggestions are useful on the\r\nsurface.  By their means we can deal with individual difficulties as\r\nthey arise.  The two methods are complementary.\r\n\r\nParticular suggestions prove very valuable in reinforcing and rendering\r\npermanent the effects obtained by the technique for overcoming pain,\r\nwhich will be outlined in the next chapter.  Before commencing the\r\nattack we should sit down, close our eyes and say calmly and\r\nconfidently to ourselves: \"I am now going to rid myself of this pain.\"\r\nWhen the desired result has been obtained, we should suggest that the\r\nstate of ease and painlessness now re-established will be permanent,\r\nthat the affected part will rapidly be toned up into a condition of\r\nnormal health, and will remain always in that desirable state.  Should\r\nwe have obtained only a lessening of the trouble without its complete\r\nremoval our suggestion should take this form: \"I have obtained a\r\nconsiderable degree of relief, and in the next few minutes it will\r\nbecome complete.  I shall be restored to my normal condition of health\r\nand shall continue so for the future.\"  Thus our assault upon the pain\r\nis made under the best conditions, and should in every case prove\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\nWe should employ particular suggestions also for overcoming the\r\ndifficulties which confront us from time to time in our daily lives,\r\nand for securing the full success of any task we take in hand.  The use\r\nof the general suggestion will gradually strengthen our\r\nself-confidence, until we shall expect success in any enterprise of\r\nwhich the reason approves.  But until this consummation is reached,\r\nuntil our balance of self-confidence is adequate for all our needs, we\r\ncan obtain an overdraft for immediate use by means of particular\r\nsuggestion.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that the dimensions of any obstacle depend at\r\nleast as much upon our mental attitude towards it as upon its intrinsic\r\ndifficulty.  The neurasthenic, who imagines he cannot rise from his\r\nbed, cannot do so because this simple operation is endowed by his mind\r\nwith immense difficulty.  The great mass of normal people commit the\r\nsame fault in a less degree.  Their energy is expended partly in doing\r\ntheir daily work, and partly in overcoming the resistance in their own\r\nminds.  By the action of the law of reversed effort the negative idea\r\nthey foster frequently brings their efforts to naught, and the very\r\nexertions they make condemn their activities to failure.\r\n\r\nFor this reason it is necessary, before undertaking any task which\r\nseems to us difficult, to suggest that it is in fact easy.  We close\r\nour eyes and say quietly to ourselves, \"The work I have to do is easy,\r\nquite easy.  Since it is easy I can do it, and I shall do it\r\nefficiently and successfully.  Moreover, I shall enjoy doing it; it\r\nwill give me pleasure, my whole personality will apply itself\r\nharmoniously to the task, and the results will be even beyond my\r\nexpectation.\"  We should dwell on these ideas, repeating them\r\ntranquilly and effortlessly.  Soon our mind will become serene, full of\r\nhope and confidence.  Then we can begin to think out our method of\r\nprocedure, to let the mind dwell on the means best suited to attain our\r\nobject.  Since the impediments created by fear and anxiety are now\r\nremoved our ideas will flow freely, our plans will construct themselves\r\nin the quiet of the mind, and we shall come to the actual work with a\r\ncreative vigour and singleness of purpose.\r\n\r\nBy a similar procedure the problems of conduct which defy solution by\r\nconscious thought will frequently yield to autosuggestion.  When we are\r\n\"at our wits' ends,\" as the saying goes, to discover the best path out\r\nof a dilemma, when choice between conflicting possibilities seems\r\nimpossible, it is worse than useless to continue the struggle.  The law\r\nof reversed effort is at work paralysing our mental faculties.  We\r\nshould put it aside, let the waves of effort subside, and suggest to\r\nourselves that at a particular point of time the solution will come to\r\nus of its own accord.  If we can conveniently do so, it is well to let\r\na period of sleep intervene, to suggest that the solution will come to\r\nus on the morrow; for during sleep the Unconscious is left undisturbed\r\nto realise in its own way the end we have consciously set before it.\r\n\r\nThis operation often takes place spontaneously, as when a problem left\r\nunsolved the night before yields its solution apparently by an\r\ninspiration when we arise in the morning.  \"Sleep on it\" still remains\r\nthe best counsel for those in perplexity, but they should preface their\r\nslumbers by the positive autosuggestion that on waking they will find\r\nthe difficulty resolved.  In this connection it is interesting to note\r\nthat autosuggestion is already widely made use of as a means of waking\r\nat a particular hour.  A person who falls asleep with the idea in his\r\nmind of the time at which he wishes to wake, will wake at that time.\r\nIt may be added that wherever sleep is utilised for the realisation of\r\nparticular suggestions, these suggestions should be made in addition to\r\nthe general formula, either immediately before or immediately after;\r\nthey should never be substituted for it.\r\n\r\nWith some afflictions, such as fits, the attack is often so sudden and\r\nunexpected that the patient is smitten down before he has a chance to\r\ndefend himself.  Particular suggestions should be aimed first of all at\r\nsecuring due warning of the approaching attack.  We should employ such\r\nterms as these: \"In future I shall always know well in advance when a\r\nfit is coming on.  I shall be amply warned of its approach.  When these\r\nwarnings occur I shall feel no fear or anxiety.  I shall be quite\r\nconfident of my power to avert it.\"  As soon as the warning comes--as\r\nit will come, quite unmistakably--the sufferer should isolate himself\r\nand use a particular suggestion to prevent the fit from developing.  He\r\nshould first suggest calm and self-control, then affirm repeatedly, but\r\nof course without effort, that the normal state of health is\r\nreasserting itself, that the mind is fully under control, and that\r\nnothing can disturb its balance.  All sudden paroxysms, liable to take\r\nus unexpectedly, should be treated by the same method, which in Coué's\r\nexperience has amply justified itself.\r\n\r\nNervous troubles and violent emotions, such as fear and anger, often\r\nexpress themselves by physical movements.  Fear may cause trembling,\r\npalpitation, chattering of the teeth; anger a violent clenching of the\r\nfists.  Baudouin advises that particular suggestions in these cases\r\nshould be directed rather against the motor expression than against the\r\npsychic cause, that our aim should be to cultivate a state of physical\r\nimpassibility.  But since a positive suggestion possesses greater force\r\nthan a negative, it would seem better to attack simultaneously both the\r\ncause and the effect.  Instead of anger, suggest that you will feel\r\nsympathy, patience, good-humour, and consequently that your bodily\r\nstate will be easy and unconstrained.\r\n\r\nA form of particular suggestion which possesses distinct advantages of\r\nits own is the quiet repetition of a single word.  If your mind is\r\ndistracted and confused, sit down, close your eyes, and murmur slowly\r\nand reflectively the single word \"Calm.\"  Say it reverently, drawing it\r\nout to its full length and pausing after each repetition.  Gradually\r\nyour mind will be stilled and quietened, and you will be filled with a\r\nsense of harmony and peace.  This method seems most applicable to the\r\nattainment of moral qualities.  An evil passion can be quelled by the\r\nuse of the word denoting the contrary virtue.  The power of the word\r\ndepends largely upon its aesthetic and moral associations.  Words like\r\njoy, strength, love, purity, denoting the highest ideals of the human\r\nmind, possess great potency and are capable, thus used, of dispelling\r\nmental states in which their opposites predominate.  The name\r\nReflective Suggestion, which Baudouin applies indifferently to all\r\nautosuggestions induced by the subject's own choice, might well be\r\nreserved for this specific form of particular suggestion.\r\n\r\nThe field for the exercise of particular suggestions is practically\r\nlimitless.  Whenever you feel a need for betterment, of whatever nature\r\nit may be, a particular suggestion will help you.  But it must once\r\nmore be repeated that these particular suggestions are merely aids and\r\nauxiliaries, which may, if leisure is scant, be neglected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nHOW TO DEAL WITH PAIN\r\n\r\nPain, whether of mind or body, introduces a new element for which we\r\nhave hitherto made no provision.  By monopolising the attention it\r\nkeeps the conscious mind fully alert and so prevents one from attaining\r\nthe measure of outcropping needful to initiate successfully an\r\nautosuggestion.  Thus if we introduce the \"no-pain\" idea into the\r\nconscious, it is overwhelmed by its contrary--pain, and the patient's\r\ncondition becomes, if anything, worse.\r\n\r\nTo overcome this difficulty quite a new method is required.  If we\r\nspeak a thought, that thought, while we speak it, must occupy our\r\nminds.  We could not speak it unless we thought it.  By continually\r\nrepeating \"I have no pain\" the sufferer constantly renews that thought\r\nin his mind.  Unfortunately, after each repetition the pain-thought\r\ninsinuates itself, so that the mind oscillates between \"I have no pain\"\r\nand \"I have some pain,\" or \"I have a bad pain.\"  But if we repeat our\r\nphrase so rapidly that the contrary association has no time to insert\r\nitself, we compel the mind willy-nilly to dwell on it.  Thus by a fresh\r\npath we reach the same goal as that attained by induced outcropping; we\r\ncause an idea to remain in occupation of the mind without calling up a\r\ncontrary association.  This we found to be the prime condition of\r\nacceptation, and in fact by this means we can compel the Unconscious to\r\nrealise the \"no-pain\" thought and so put an end to the pain.\r\n\r\nBut the sentence \"I have no pain\" does not lend itself to rapid\r\nrepetition.  The physical difficulties are too great; the tongue and\r\nlips become entangled in the syllables and we have to stop to restore\r\norder.  Even if we were dexterous enough to articulate the words\r\nsuccessfully, we should only meet with a new difficulty.  The most\r\nemphatic word in the phrase is \"pain\"; involuntarily we should find\r\nourself stressing this word with particular force, so strengthening in\r\nour minds the very idea we are trying to dislodge.\r\n\r\nWe shall do best to copy as closely as we can Coué's own procedure.\r\nThe phrase he uses, \"ça passe,\" makes no mention of the hurt; it is\r\nextremely easy to say, and it produces an unbroken stream of sound,\r\nlike the whirr of a machine or the magnified buzz of an insect, which,\r\nas it were, carries the mind off its feet.  The phrase recommended by\r\nBaudouin, \"It is passing off,\" produces no such effect, and in fact\r\ndefies all our attempts to repeat it quickly.  On the whole, the most\r\nsuitable English version seems to be \"It's going.\"  Only the word\r\n\"going\" should be repeated, and the treatment should conclude with the\r\nemphatic statement \"gone!\"  The word \"going,\" rapidly gabbled, gives\r\nthe impression of a mechanical drill, biting its way irresistibly into\r\nsome hard substance.  We can think of it as drilling the desired\r\nthought into the mind.\r\n\r\nIf you are suffering from any severe pain, such as toothache or\r\nheadache, sit down, close your eyes and assure yourself calmly that you\r\nare going to get rid of it.  Now gently stroke with your hand the\r\naffected part and repeat at the same time as fast as you can, producing\r\na continuous stream of sound, the words: \"It's going, going, going ...\r\ngone!\"  Keep it up for about a minute, pausing only to take a deep\r\nbreath when necessary, and using the word \"gone\" only at the conclusion\r\nof the whole proceeding.  At the end of this time the pain will either\r\nhave entirely ceased or at least sensibly abated.  In either case apply\r\nthe particular suggestions recommended in the previous chapter.  If the\r\npain has ceased suggest that it will not return; if it has only\r\ndiminished suggest that it will shortly pass away altogether.  Now\r\nreturn to whatever employment you were engaged in when the pain began.\r\nLet other interests occupy your attention.  If in a reasonable space,\r\nsay half an hour, the pain still troubles you, isolate yourself again;\r\nsuggest once more that you are going to master it, and repeat the\r\nprocedure.\r\n\r\nIt is no exaggeration to say that by this process any pain can be\r\nconquered.  It may be, in extreme cases, that you will have to return\r\nseveral times to the attack.  This will generally occur when you have\r\nbeen foolish enough to supply the pain with a cause--a decayed tooth, a\r\ndraught of cold air, etc.--and so justify it to your reason, and give\r\nit, so to speak, an intellectual sanction.  Or it may be that it will\r\ncease only to return again.  But do not be discouraged; attack it\r\nfirmly and you are bound to succeed.\r\n\r\nThe same procedure is equally effective with distressing states of\r\nmind, worry, fear, despondency.  In such cases the stroking movement of\r\nthe hand should be applied to the forehead.\r\n\r\nEven in this exercise no more effort should be used than is necessary.\r\nSimply repeat rapidly the word which informs you that the trouble is\r\ngoing, and let this, with the stroking movement of the hand, which, as\r\nit were, fixes the attention to that particular spot, be the sum and\r\nsubstance of your effort.  With practice it will become easier, you\r\nwill \"drop into it\"; that is to say, the Unconscious will perform the\r\nadaptations necessary to make it more effective.  After a time you\r\nshould be able to obtain relief in twenty to twenty-five seconds.  But\r\nthe effect is still more far-reaching; you will be delivered from the\r\nfear of pain.  Regarding yourself as its master, you will be able with\r\nthe mere threat of treatment to prevent it from developing.  You will\r\nhang up a card, \"No admittance,\" on the doors of your conscious mind.\r\n\r\nIt may be that the pain attacks you in the street or in a workshop; in\r\nsome public place where the audible repetition of the phrase would\r\nattract attention.  In that case it is best to close the eyes for a\r\nmoment and formulate this particular suggestion: \"I shall not add to\r\nthis trouble by thinking about it; my mind will be occupied by other\r\nthings; but on the first opportunity I shall make it pass away,\" Then\r\nas soon as you can conveniently do so make use of the phrase \"It's\r\ngoing.\"  When you have become expert in the use of this form of\r\nsuggestion you will be able to exorcise the trouble by repeating the\r\nphrase mentally--at any rate if the words are outlined with the lips\r\nand tongue.  But the beginner should rely for a time entirely on\r\naudible treatment.  By dropping it too soon he will only court\r\ndisappointment.\r\n\r\nIt sometimes happens that a patient is so prostrated by pain or misery\r\nthat he has not the energy to undertake even the repetition of the word\r\n\"going.\"  The pain-thought so obsesses the mind that the state of\r\npainlessness seems too remote even to contemplate.  Under these\r\ncircumstances it seems best to employ this strategy.  Lie down on a\r\nbed, sofa, or arm-chair and relax both mind and body.  Cease from all\r\neffort--which can only make things worse--and let the pain-thought have\r\nits way.  After a time your energies will begin to collect themselves,\r\nyour mind to reassert its control.  Now make a firm suggestion of\r\nsuccess and apply the method.  Get another person to help you, as Coué\r\nhelps his patients, by performing the passes with the hand and\r\nrepeating the phrase with you.  By this means you can make quite sure\r\nof success.  This seemingly contradictory proceeding is analogous to\r\nthat of the angler \"playing\" a fish.  He waits till it has run its\r\ncourse before bringing his positive resources into play.\r\n\r\nBaudouin recommends an analogous proceeding as a weapon against\r\ninsomnia.  The patient, he says, should rapidly repeat the phrase, \"I\r\nam going to sleep,\" letting his mind be swept away by a torrent of\r\nwords.  Once more the objection arises that the phrase \"I am going to\r\nsleep\" is not such as we can rapidly repeat.  But even if we substitute\r\nfor it some simple phrase which can be easily articulated it is\r\ndoubtful whether it will succeed in more than a small percentage of\r\ncases.  Success is more likely to attend us if we avail ourselves of\r\nthe method of reflective repetition mentioned in the last chapter.  We\r\nshould take up the position most favourable to slumber and then repeat\r\nslowly and contemplatively the word \"Sleep.\"  The more impersonal our\r\nattitude towards the idea the more rapidly it will be realised in our\r\nown slumbers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nAUTOSUGGESTION AND THE CHILD\r\n\r\nIn treating children it should be remembered that autosuggestion is\r\nprimarily not a remedy but a means of insuring healthy growth.  It\r\nshould not be reserved for times when the child is sick, but provided\r\ndaily, with the same regularity as meals.\r\n\r\nChildren grow up weakly not from lack of energy, but because of a waste\r\nand misapplication of it.  The inner conflict, necessitated by the\r\ncontinual process of adaptation which we call growth, is often of quite\r\nunnecessary violence, not only making a great temporary demand on the\r\nchild's vital energy, but even locking it up in the Unconscious in the\r\nform of \"complexes,\" so that its future life is deprived of a portion\r\nof its due vitality.  A wise use of autosuggestion will preclude these\r\ndisasters.  Growth will be ordered and controlled.  The necessary\r\nconflicts will be brought to a successful issue, the unnecessary ones\r\navoided.\r\n\r\nAutosuggestion may very well begin before the child is born.  It is a\r\nmatter of common knowledge that a mother must be shielded during\r\npregnancy from any experience involving shock or fright, since these\r\nexert a harmful effect on the developing embryo, and may in extreme\r\ncases result in abortion, or in physical deformity or mental weakness\r\nin the child.  Instances of this ill-effect are comparatively common,\r\nand the link between cause and effect is often unmistakable.  There is\r\nno need to point out that these cases are nothing more than spontaneous\r\nautosuggestions operating in the maternal Unconscious; since during\r\npregnancy the mother moulds her little one not only by the food she\r\neats but also by the thoughts she thinks.  The heightened emotionality\r\ncharacteristic of this state bespeaks an increased tendency to\r\noutcropping, and so an increased suggestibility.  Thus spontaneous\r\nautosuggestions are far more potent than in the normal course of life.\r\nBut, happily, induced autosuggestions are aided by the same conditions,\r\nso that the mother awake to her powers and duties can do as much good\r\nas the ignorant may do harm.\r\n\r\nWithout going into debatable questions, such as the possibility of\r\npredetermining the sex of the child to be born, one can find many\r\nhelpful ways of aiding and benefiting the growing life by\r\nautosuggestive means.  The mother should avoid with more than ordinary\r\ncare all subjects, whether in reading or conversation, which bear on\r\nevil in any form, and she should seek whatever uplifts the mind and\r\nfurnishes it with beautiful and joyous thought.  But the technical\r\nmethods of autosuggestion can also be brought into action.\r\n\r\nThe mother should suggest to herself that her organism is furnishing\r\nthe growing life with all it needs, and that the child will be strong\r\nand healthy in mind, in body, and in character.\r\n\r\nThese suggestions should be in general terms bearing on qualities of\r\nundoubted good, for obviously it is not desirable to define an\r\nindependent life too narrowly.  They need consist only of a few\r\nsentences, and should be formulated night and morning immediately\r\nbefore or after the general formula.  Furthermore, when the mother's\r\nthoughts during the day stray to the subject of her child, she can take\r\nthis opportunity to repeat the whole or some part of the particular\r\nsuggestion she has chosen.  These few simple measures will amply\r\nsuffice.  Any undue tendency of the mind to dwell on the thought of the\r\nchild, even in the form of good suggestions, should not be encouraged.\r\nA normal mental life is in itself the best of conditions for the\r\nwelfare of both mother and child.  For her own sake however the mother\r\nmight well suggest that the delivery will be painless and easy.\r\n\r\nThe only direct means of autosuggestion applicable to the child for\r\nsome months after birth is that of the caress, though it must be\r\nremembered that the mental states of mother and nurse are already\r\nstamping themselves on the little mind, forming it inevitably for\r\nbetter or worse.  Should any specific trouble arise, the method of\r\nMlle. Kauffmant should be applied by the mother.  Taking the child on\r\nher knee she should gently caress the affected part, thinking the while\r\nof its reinstatement in perfect health.  It seems generally advisable\r\nto express these thoughts in words.  Obviously, the words themselves\r\nwill mean nothing to an infant of two or three months, but they will\r\nhold the mother's thought in the right channel, and this thought, by\r\nthe tone of her voice, the touch of her hand, will be communicated to\r\nthe child.  Whether telepathy plays any part in this process we need\r\nnot inquire, but the baby is psychically as well as physically so\r\ndependent on the mother that her mental states are communicated by\r\nmeans quite ineffective with adults.  Love in itself exerts a\r\nsuggestive power of the highest order.\r\n\r\nWhen the child shows signs of understanding what is said to it, before\r\nit begins itself to speak, the following method should be applied.\r\nAfter the little one has fallen asleep at night the mother enters the\r\nroom, taking care not to awaken it, and stands about a yard from the\r\nhead of the cot.  She proceeds then to formulate in a whisper such\r\nsuggestions as seem necessary.  If the child is ailing the suggestion\r\nmight take the form of the phrase \"You are getting better\" repeated\r\ntwenty times.  If it is in health the general formula will suffice.\r\nParticular suggestions may also be formulated bearing on the child's\r\nhealth, character, intellectual development, etc.  These of course\r\nshould be in accordance with the instructions given in the chapter\r\ndevoted to particular suggestions.  On withdrawing, the mother should\r\nagain be careful not to awaken the little one.  Should it show signs of\r\nwaking, the whispered command \"sleep,\" repeated several times, will\r\nlull it again to rest.  Baudouin recommends that during these\r\nsuggestions the mother should lay her hand on the child's forehead.\r\nThe above, however, is the method preferred by Coué.\r\n\r\nThis nightly practice is the most effective means of conveying\r\nautosuggestions to the child-mind.  It should be made a regular habit\r\nwhich nothing is allowed to interrupt.  If for any reason the mother is\r\nunable to perform it, her place may be taken by the father, the nurse,\r\nor some relative.  But for obvious reasons the duty belongs by right to\r\nthe mother, and, when a few weeks' practice has revealed its beneficent\r\npower, few mothers will be willing to delegate it to a less suitable\r\nagent.\r\n\r\nThis practice, as stated above, may well begin before the child has\r\nactually learned to speak, for its Unconscious will already be forming\r\na scheme more or less distinct of the significance of the sounds that\r\nreach it, and will not fail to gather the general tenor of the words\r\nspoken.  The date at which it should be discontinued is less easy to\r\nspecify.  Growth, to be healthy, must carry with it a gradual increase\r\nin independence and self-sufficiency.  There seems to be some slight\r\ndanger that the practice of nightly suggestions, if continued too long,\r\nmight prolong unduly the state of dependence upon parental support.\r\nReliable indications on this point are furnished, however, by the child\r\nitself.  As soon as it is able to face its daily problems for itself,\r\nwhen it no longer runs to the parent for help and advice in every\r\nlittle difficulty, the time will have arrived for the parental\r\nsuggestions to cease.\r\n\r\nAs soon as a child is able to speak it should be taught to repeat the\r\ngeneral formula night and morning in the same way as an adult.  Thus\r\nwhen the time comes to discontinue the parent's suggestions their\r\neffect will be carried on by those the child formulates itself.  There\r\nis one thing more to add: in the case of boys it would seem better at\r\nthe age of seven or eight for the father to replace the mother in the\r\nrôle of suggester, while the mother, of course, performs the office\r\nthroughout for her girls.  Should any signs appear that the period of\r\npuberty is bringing with it undue difficulties or perils, the nightly\r\npractice might be resumed in the form of particular suggestions bearing\r\non the specific difficulties.  It must be remembered, however, that the\r\nchild's sexual problem is essentially different from that of the adult,\r\nand the suggestions must therefore be in the most general terms.  Here\r\nas elsewhere the end alone should be suggested, the Unconscious being\r\nleft free to choose its own means.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the child has learnt to speak it should not be allowed to\r\nsuffer pain.  The best method to adopt is that practised by Coué in his\r\nconsultations.  Let the child close its eyes and repeat with the\r\nparent, \"It's going, going ... gone!\" while the latter gently strokes\r\nthe affected part.  But as soon as possible the child should be\r\nencouraged to overcome smaller difficulties for itself, until the\r\nparent's help is eventually almost dispensed with.  This is a powerful\r\nmeans of developing self-reliance and fostering the sense of\r\nsuperiority to difficulties which will be invaluable in later life.\r\n\r\nThat children readily take to the practice is shown by these examples,\r\nwhich are again quoted from letters received by Coué.\r\n\r\n\"Your youngest disciple is our little David.  The poor little chap had\r\nan accident to-day.  Going up in the lift with his father, when quite\r\nfour feet up, he fell out on his head and on to a hard stone floor.  He\r\nwas badly bruised and shocked, and when put to bed lay still and kept\r\nsaying: 'ça passe, ça passe,' over and over again, and then looked up\r\nand said, 'no, not gone away.'  To-night he said again 'ça passe' and\r\nthen added, 'nearly gone.'  So he is better.\"\r\n\r\n  B. K. (London).\r\n  8 _January_, 1922.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother lady writes:\r\n\r\n\"Our cook's little niece, aged 23 months--the one we cured of\r\nbronchitis--gave herself a horrid blow on the head yesterday.  Instead\r\nof crying she began to smile, passed her hand over the place and said\r\nsweetly, 'ça passe.'  Hasn't she been well brought up?\"\r\n\r\nAll these methods are extremely simple and involve little expenditure\r\nof time and none of money.  They have proved their efficacy over and\r\nover again in Nancy, and there is no reason why a mother of average\r\nintelligence and conscientiousness should not obtain equally good\r\nresults.  Naturally, first attempts will be a little awkward, but there\r\nis no need for discouragement on that account.  Even supposing that\r\nthrough the introduction of effort some slight harm were done--and the\r\nchance is comparatively remote--this need cause no alarm.  The right\r\nautosuggestion will soon counteract it and produce positive good in its\r\nplace.  But any mother who has practised autosuggestion for herself\r\nwill be able correctly to apply it to her child.\r\n\r\nAt first glance the procedure may seem revolutionary, but think it over\r\nfor a moment and you will see that it is as old as the hills.  It is\r\nmerely a systematisation on a scientific basis of the method mothers\r\nhave intuitively practised since the world began.  \"Sleep, baby, sleep.\r\nAngels are watching o'er thee,\"--what is this but a particular\r\nsuggestion?  How does a wise mother proceed when her little one falls\r\nand grazes its hand?  She says something of this kind: \"Let me kiss it\r\nand then it will be well.\"  She kisses it, and with her assurance that\r\nthe pain has gone the child runs happily back to its play.  This is\r\nonly a charming variation of the method of the caress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nInduced Autosuggestion is not a substitute for medical practice.  It\r\nwill not make us live for ever, neither will it free us completely from\r\nthe common ills of life.  What it may do in the future, when all its\r\nimplications have been realised, all its resources exploited, we cannot\r\nsay.  There is no doubt that a generation brought up by its canons\r\nwould differ profoundly from the disease-ridden population of to-day.\r\nBut our immediate interest is with the present.\r\n\r\nThe adult of to-day carries in his Unconscious a memory clogged with a\r\nmass of adverse suggestions which have been accumulating since\r\nchildhood.  The first task of Induced Autosuggestion will be to clear\r\naway this mass of mental lumber.  Not until this has been accomplished\r\ncan the real man appear and the creative powers of autosuggestion begin\r\nto manifest themselves.\r\n\r\nBy the use of this method each one of us should be able to look forward\r\nto a life in which disease is a diminishing factor.  But how great a\r\npart it will play depends upon the conditions we start from and the\r\nregularity and correctness of our practice.  Should disease befall us\r\nwe possess within a potent means of expelling it, but this does not\r\ninvalidate the complementary method of destroying it from without.\r\nAutosuggestion and the usual medical practice should go hand in hand,\r\neach supplementing the other.  If you are ill, call in your doctor as\r\nbefore, but enlist the resources of Induced Autosuggestion to reinforce\r\nand extend his treatment.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it must be insisted on that autosuggestion should be\r\nutilised for every ailment, whatever its nature, and whether its\r\ninroads be grave or slight.  Every disease is either strengthened or\r\nweakened by the action of the mind.  We cannot take up an attitude of\r\nneutrality.  Either we must aid the disease to destroy us by allowing\r\nour minds to dwell on it, or we must oppose it and destroy it by a\r\nstream of healthful dynamic thought.  Too frequently we spontaneously\r\nadopt the former course.\r\n\r\nThe general opinion that functional and nervous diseases alone are\r\nsusceptible to suggestive treatment is at variance with the facts.\r\nDuring Coué's thirty years of practice, in which many thousands of\r\ncases have been treated, he has found that organic troubles yield as\r\neasily as functional, that bodily derangements are even easier to cure\r\nthan nervous and mental.  He makes no such distinctions; an illness is\r\nan illness whatever its nature.  As such Coué attacks it, and in 98 per\r\ncent. of cases he attains in greater or less degree a positive result.\r\n\r\nApart from the permanently insane, in whose minds the machinery of\r\nautosuggestion is itself deranged, there are only two classes of\r\npatient with whom Induced Autosuggestion seems to fail.  One consists\r\nof persons whose intelligence is so low that the directions given are\r\nnever comprehended; the other of those who lack the power of voluntary\r\nattention and cannot devote their minds to an idea even for a few\r\nconsecutive seconds.  These two classes, however, are numerically\r\ninsignificant, together making up not much more than 2 per cent. of the\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nAutosuggestion is equally valuable as an aid to surgical practice.  A\r\nbroken bone--the sceptic's last resource--cannot of course be treated\r\nby autosuggestion alone.  A surgeon must be called in to mend it.  But\r\nwhen the limb has been rightly set and the necessary mechanical\r\nprecautions have been taken, autosuggestion will provide the best\r\npossible conditions for recovery.  It can prevent lameness, stiffness,\r\nunsightly deformity and the other evils which a broken limb is apt to\r\nentail, and it will shorten considerably the normal period of\r\nconvalescence.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes stated that the results obtained by autosuggestion are\r\nnot permanent.  This objection is really artificial, arising from the\r\nfact that we ignore the true nature of autosuggestion and regard it\r\nmerely as a remedy.  When we employ autosuggestion to heal a malady our\r\naim is so to leaven the Unconscious with healthful thoughts, that not\r\nonly will that specific malady be excluded, but all others with it.\r\nAutosuggestion should not only remove a particular form of disease, but\r\nthe tendency to all disease.\r\n\r\nIf after an ailment has been removed we allow our mind to revert to\r\nunhealthy thoughts, they will tend to realise themselves in the same\r\nway as any others, and we may again fall a victim to ill-health.  Our\r\nsickness may take the same form as on the preceding occasion, or it may\r\nnot.  That will depend on the nature of our thought.  But by the\r\nregular employment of the general formula we can prevent any such\r\nrecurrence.  Instead of reverting to unhealthy states of mind we shall\r\nprogressively strengthen the healthy and creative thought that has\r\nalready given us health, so that with each succeeding day our defence\r\nwill be more impenetrable.  Not only do we thus avoid a relapse into\r\nformer ailments but we clear out of our path those which lie in wait\r\nfor us in the future.\r\n\r\nWe saw that in the Nancy clinic some of the cures effected are almost\r\ninstantaneous.  It would be a mistake, however, to embark on the\r\npractice of Induced Autosuggestion with the impression that we are\r\ngoing to be miraculously healed in the space of a few days.  Granted\r\nsufficient faith, such a result would undoubtedly ensue; nay, more, we\r\nhave records of quite a number of such cases, even where the help of a\r\nsecond person has not been called in.  Here is an example.  A friend of\r\nmine, M. Albert P., of Bordeaux, had suffered for more than ten years\r\nwith neuralgia of the face.  Hearing of Coué, he wrote to him, and\r\nreceived instructions to repeat the general formula.  He did so, and on\r\nthe second day the neuralgia had vanished and has never since returned.\r\nBut such faith is not common.  Immediate cures are the exception, and\r\nit will be safer for us to look forward to a gradual and progressive\r\nimprovement.  In this way we shall guard against disappointment.  It\r\nmay be added that Coué prefers the gradual cure, finding it more stable\r\nand less likely to be disturbed by adverse conditions.\r\n\r\nWe should approach autosuggestion in the same reasonable manner as we\r\napproach any other scientific discovery.  There is no hocus-pocus about\r\nit, nor are any statements made here which experience cannot verify.\r\nBut the attitude we should beware most of is that of the intellectual\r\namateur, who makes the vital things of life small coin to exchange with\r\nhis neighbour of the dinner-table.  Like religion, autosuggestion is a\r\nthing to practise.  A man may be conversant with all the creeds in\r\nChristendom and be none the better for it; while some simple soul,\r\nloving God and his fellows, may combine the high principles of\r\nChristianity in his life without any acquaintance with theology.  So it\r\nis with autosuggestion.\r\n\r\nAutosuggestion is just as effective in the treatment of moral\r\ndelinquencies as in that of physical ills.  Drunkenness, kleptomania,\r\nthe drug habit, uncontrolled or perverted sexual desires, as well as\r\nminor failings of character, are all susceptible to its action.  It is\r\nas powerful in small things as in great.  By particular suggestions we\r\ncan modify our tastes.  We can acquire a relish for the dishes we\r\nnaturally dislike, and make disagreeable medicine taste pleasant.  So\r\nencouraging has been its application to the field of morals that Coué\r\nis trying to gain admittance to the French state reformatories.  So\r\nfar, the official dislike for innovations has proved a barrier, but\r\nthere is good reason to hope that in the near future the application of\r\nthis method to the treatment of the criminal will be greatly extended.\r\n\r\nBy way of anticipating an objection it may be stated that the Coué\r\nmethod of Induced Autosuggestion is in no sense inferior to hypnotic\r\nsuggestion.  Coué himself began his career as a hypnotist, but being\r\ndissatisfied with the results, set out in quest of a method more simple\r\nand universal.  Conscious autosuggestion, apart from its convenience,\r\ncan boast one great advantage over its rival.  The effects of hypnotic\r\nsuggestion are often lost within a few hours of the treatment.  Whereas\r\nby the use of the general formula the results of Induced Autosuggestion\r\ngo on progressively augmenting.\r\n\r\nHere we touch again the question of the suggester.  We have already\r\nseen that a suggester is not needed, that autosuggestion can yield its\r\nfullest fruits to those who practise it unaided.  But some persons\r\ncannot be prevailed on to accept this fact.  They feel a sense of\r\ninsufficiency; the mass of old wrong suggestions has risen so\r\nmountain-high that they imagine themselves incapable of removing it.\r\nWith such the presence of a suggester is an undoubted help.  They have\r\nnothing to do but lie passive and receive the ideas he evokes.  Even\r\nso, however, they will get little good unless they consent to repeat\r\nthe general formula.\r\n\r\nBut as long as we look on autosuggestion as a remedy we miss its true\r\nsignificance.  Primarily it is a means of self-culture, and one far\r\nmore potent than any we have hitherto possessed.  It enables us to\r\ndevelop the mental qualities we lack: efficiency, judgment, creative\r\nimagination, all that will help us to bring our life's enterprise to a\r\nsuccessful end.  Most of us are aware of thwarted abilities, powers\r\nundeveloped, impulses checked in their growth.  These are present in\r\nour Unconscious like trees in a forest, which, overshadowed by their\r\nneighbours, are stunted for lack of air and sunshine.  By means of\r\nautosuggestion we can supply them with the power needed for growth and\r\nbring them to fruition in our conscious lives.  However old, however\r\ninfirm, however selfish, weak or vicious we may be, autosuggestion will\r\ndo something for us.  It gives us a new means of culture and discipline\r\nby which the \"accents immature,\" the \"purposes unsure\" can be nursed\r\ninto strength, and the evil impulses attacked at the root.  It is\r\nessentially an individual practice, an individual attitude of mind.\r\nOnly a narrow view would split it up into categories, debating its\r\napplication to this thing or to that.  It touches our being in its\r\nwholeness.  Below the fussy perturbed little ego, with its local\r\nhabitation, its name, its habits and views and oddities is an ocean of\r\npower, as serene as the depths below the troubled surface of the sea.\r\nWhatever is of you comes eventually thence, however perverted by the\r\nprism of self-consciousness.  Autosuggestion is a channel by which the\r\ntranquil powers of this ultimate being are raised to the level of our\r\nlife here and now.\r\n\r\nWhat prospects does autosuggestion open to us in the future?\r\n\r\nIt teaches us that the burdens of life are, at least in large measure,\r\nof our own creating.  We reproduce in ourselves and in our\r\ncircumstances the thoughts of our minds.  It goes further.  It offers\r\nus a means by which we can change these thoughts when they are evil and\r\nfoster them when they are good, so producing a corresponding betterment\r\nin our individual life.  But the process does not end with the\r\nindividual.  The thoughts of society are realised in social conditions,\r\nthe thoughts of humanity in world conditions.  What would be the\r\nattitude towards our social and international problems of a generation\r\nnurtured from infancy in the knowledge and practice of autosuggestion?\r\nIf fear and disease were banned from the individual life, could they\r\npersist in the life of the nation?  If each person found happiness in\r\nhis own heart would the illusory greed for possession survive?  The\r\nacceptance of autosuggestion entails a change of attitude, a\r\nrevaluation of life.  If we stand with our faces westward we see\r\nnothing but clouds and darkness, yet by a simple turn of the head we\r\nbring the wide panorama of the sunrise into view.\r\n\r\nThat Coué's discoveries may profoundly affect our educational methods\r\nis beyond question.  Hitherto we have been dealing directly only with\r\nthe conscious mind, feeding it with information, grafting on to it\r\nuseful accomplishments.  What has been done for the development of\r\ncharacter has been incidental and secondary.  This was inevitable so\r\nlong as the Unconscious remained undiscovered, but now we have the\r\nmeans of reaching profounder depths, of endowing the child not only\r\nwith reading and arithmetic, but with health, character and personality.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps it is in our treatment of the criminal that the greatest\r\nrevolution may be expected.  The acts for which he is immured result\r\nfrom nothing more than twists and tangles of the threads of thought in\r\nthe Unconscious mind.  This is the view of eminent authorities.  But\r\nautosuggestion takes us a long step further.  It shows how these\r\ndiscords of character may be resolved.  Since Coué has succeeded in\r\nrestoring to moral health a youth of homicidal tendencies, why should\r\nnot the same method succeed with many of the outcasts who fill our\r\nprisons?  At least the younger delinquents should prove susceptible.\r\nBut the idea underlying this attitude entails a revolution in our penal\r\nprocedure.  It means little less than this: that crime is a disease and\r\nshould be treated as such; that the idea of punishment must give place\r\nto that of cure; the vindictive attitude to one of pity.  This brings\r\nus near to the ideals of the New Testament, and indeed, autosuggestion,\r\nas a force making for goodness, is bound to touch closely on religion.\r\n\r\nIt teaches the doctrine of the inner life which saints and sages have\r\nproclaimed through all ages.  It asserts that within are the sources of\r\ncalm, of power and of courage, and that the man who has once attained\r\nmastery of this inner sphere is secure in the face of all that may\r\nbefall him.  This truth is apparent in the lives of great men.  Martyrs\r\ncould sing at the stake because their eyes were turned within on the\r\nvision of glory which filled their hearts.  Great achievements have\r\nbeen wrought by men who had the fortitude to follow the directions of\r\nan inner voice, even in contradiction to the massed voices they heard\r\nwithout.\r\n\r\nSuppose we find that the power Christ gave to his disciples to work\r\nmiracles of healing was not a gift conferred on a few selected\r\nindividuals, but was the heritage of all men; that the kingdom of\r\nheaven within us to which He alluded was available in a simple way for\r\nthe purging and elevation of our common life, for procuring sounder\r\nhealth and sweeter minds.  Is not the affirmation contained in Coué's\r\nformula a kind of prayer?  Does it not appeal to something beyond the\r\nself-life, to the infinite power lying behind us?\r\n\r\nAutosuggestion is no substitute for religion; it is rather a new weapon\r\nadded to the religious armoury.
