It is significant that the root “_tox_” of the modern word\r\n_toxicology_ can be traced back to a very ancient word meaning “bow” or\r\n“arrow,” or, in its broadest sense, some “tool” used for slaying: hence\r\nit is no far-fetched supposition that the first poison-knowledge was\r\nthat of the septic poisons. Perchance the savage found that weapons\r\nsoiled with the blood of former victims made wounds fatal; from this\r\nobservation the next step naturally would be that of experiment--the\r\narrow or spear would be steeped in all manner of offensive pastes, and\r\nsmeared with the vegetable juices of those plants which were deemed\r\nnoxious; and as the effects were mysterious, they would be ascribed to\r\nthe supernatural powers, and covered with a veil of superstition.\r\n\r\nThe history of the _poison-lehre_, like all history, begins in the\r\nregion of the myths: there was a dark saga prevailing in Greece, that in\r\nthe far north existed a land ruled by sorcerers--all children of the\r\nsun--and named Aeëtes, Perses, Hecate, Medea, and Circe. Later on, the\r\nenchanted land was localised at Colchis, and Aeëtes and Perses were said\r\nto be brothers. Hecate was the daughter of Perses; she was married to\r\nAeëtes, and their daughters were Medea and Circe. Hecate was the\r\ndiscoverer of poisonous herbs, and learned in remedies both evil and\r\ngood. Her knowledge passed to Medea, who narcotised the dragon, the\r\nguardian of the golden fleece, and incited Jason to great undertakings.\r\n\r\nIn the expedition of the Argonauts, the poets loved to describe Hecate’s\r\ngarden, with its lofty walls. Thrice-folding doors of ebony barred the\r\nentrance, which was guarded by terrible forms: only the initiated few,\r\nonly they who bore the leavened rod of expiation, and the concealed\r\nconciliatory offering of the Medea, could enter into the sanctuary.\r\nTowering above all was the temple of the dread Hecate, whose priestesses\r\noffered to the gods ghastly sacrifices.\r\n\r\n§ 2. The oldest Egyptian king, Menes, and Attalus Phylometer, the last\r\nking of Pergamus, were both famous for their knowledge of plants.\r\nAttalus Phylometer was acquainted with hyoscyamus, aconite, conium,\r\nveratrum, and others; he experimented on the preparation of poisons, and\r\noccupied himself in compounding medicines. Mithradetes Eupator stood yet\r\nhigher: the receipt for the famous _theriaca_, prepared in later years\r\nat an enormous price, and composed of fifty-four different ingredients,\r\nis ascribed to him. The wonderful skill shown by the Egyptians in\r\nembalming and technical works is sufficient to render it fairly certain\r\nthat their chemical knowledge was considerable; and the frequent\r\noperations of one caste upon the dead must have laid the foundations of\r\na pathological and anatomical culture, of which only traces remain.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians knew prussic acid as extracted in a dilute state from\r\ncertain plants, among the chief of which was certainly the peach; on a\r\npapyrus preserved at the Louvre, M. Duteil read, “Pronounce not the name\r\nof I. A. O. under the penalty of the peach!” in which dark threat,\r\nwithout doubt, lurks the meaning that those who revealed the religious\r\nmysteries of the priests were put to death by waters distilled from the\r\npeach. That the priests actually distilled the peach-leaves has been\r\ndoubted by those who consider the art of distillation a modern\r\ninvention; but this process was well known to adepts of the third and\r\nfourth centuries, and there is no inherent improbability in the\r\nsupposition that the Egyptians practised it.\r\n\r\n§ 3. From the Egyptians the knowledge of the deadly drink appears to\r\nhave passed to the Romans. At the trial of Antipater,[1] Verus brought a\r\npotion derived from Egypt, which had been intended to destroy Herod;\r\nthis was essayed on a criminal, he died at once. In the reign of\r\nTiberius, a Roman knight, accused of high treason, swallowed a poison,\r\nand fell dead at the feet of the senators: in both cases the rapidity of\r\naction appears to point to prussic acid.\r\n\r\n[1] Jos. Ant., B. xvii. c. 5.\r\n\r\nThe use of poison by the Greeks, as a means of capital punishment,\r\nwithout doubt favoured suicide by the same means; the easy, painless\r\ndeath of the state prisoner would be often preferred to the sword by one\r\ntired of life. The ancients looked indeed upon suicide, in certain\r\ninstances, as something noble, and it was occasionally formally\r\nsanctioned. Thus, Valerius Maximus tells us that he saw a woman of\r\nquality, in the island of Ceos, who, having lived happily for ninety\r\nyears, obtained leave to take a poisonous draught, lest, by living\r\nlonger, she should happen to have a change in her good fortune; and,\r\ncuriously enough, this sanctioning of self-destruction seems to have\r\nbeen copied in Europe. Mead relates that the people of Marseilles of old\r\nhad a poison, kept by the public authorities, in which cicuta was an\r\ningredient: a dose was allowed to any one who could show why he should\r\ndesire death. Whatever use or abuse might be made of a few violent\r\npoisons, Greek and Roman knowledge of poisons, their effects and methods\r\nof detection, was stationary, primitive, and incomplete.\r\n\r\n_Nicander of Colophon_ (204-138 B.C.) wrote two treatises, the most\r\nancient works on this subject extant, the one describing the effects of\r\nsnake venom; the other, the properties of opium, henbane, certain fungi,\r\ncolchicum, aconite, and conium. He divided poisons into those which kill\r\nquickly, and those which act slowly. As antidotes, those medicines are\r\nrecommended which excite vomiting--_e.g._, lukewarm oil, warm water,\r\nmallow, linseed tea, &c.\r\n\r\n_Apollodorus_ lived at the commencement of the third century B.C.: he\r\nwrote a work on poisonous animals, and one on deleterious medicines;\r\nthese works of Apollodorus were the sources from which Pliny,\r\nHeraclitus, and several of the later writers derived most of their\r\nknowledge of poisons.\r\n\r\n_Dioscorides_ (40-90 A.D.) well detailed the effects of cantharides,\r\nsulphate of copper, mercury, lead, and arsenic. By arsenic he would\r\nappear sometimes to mean the sulphides, sometimes the white oxide.\r\nDioscorides divided poisons, according to their origin, into three\r\nclasses, viz.:--\r\n\r\n1. =Animal Poisons.=--Under this head were classed cantharides and\r\nallied beetles, toads, salamanders, poisonous snakes, a particular\r\nvariety of honey, and the blood of the ox, probably the latter in a\r\nputrid state. He also speaks of the “_sea-hare_.” The sea-hare was\r\nconsidered by the ancients very poisonous, and Domitian is said to have\r\nmurdered Titus with it. It is supposed by naturalists to have been one\r\nof the genus _Aplysia_, among the _gasteropods_. Both Pliny and\r\nDioscorides depict the animal as something very formidable: it was not\r\nto be looked at, far less touched. The aplysiæ exhale a very nauseous\r\nand fœtid odour when they are approached: the best known of the species\r\nresembles, when in a state of repose, a mass of unformed flesh; when in\r\nmotion, it is like a common slug; its colour is reddish-brown; it has\r\nfour horns on its head; and the eyes, which are very small, are situated\r\nbetween the two hinder ones. This aplysia has an ink reservoir, like the\r\nsepia, and ejects it in order to escape from its enemies; it inhabits\r\nthe muddy bottom of the water, and lives on small crabs, mollusca, &c.\r\n\r\n2. =Poisons from Plants.=--Dioscorides enumerates opium, black and white\r\nhyoscyamus (especially recognising the activity of the seeds),\r\nmandragora, which was probably a mixture of various solanaceæ, conium\r\n(used to poison the condemned by the people of Athens and the dwellers\r\nof ancient Massilia), elaterin, and the juices of a species of euphorbia\r\nand apocyneæ. He also makes a special mention of aconite, the name of\r\nwhich is derived from _Akon_, a small city in Heraclea. The Greeks were\r\nwell aware of the deadly nature of aconite, and gave to it a mythical\r\norigin, from the foam of the dog Cerberus. Colchicum was also known to\r\nDioscorides: its first use was ascribed to Medea. Veratrum album and\r\nnigrum were famous medicines of the Romans, and a constituent of their\r\n“_rat and mice powders_;” they were also used as insecticides. According\r\nto Pliny, the Gauls dipped their arrows in a preparation of veratrum.[2]\r\nDaphne mezereon, called by the Romans also smilax and taxus, appears to\r\nhave been used by Cativolcus, the king of the Eburones, for the purpose\r\nof suicide, or possibly by “taxus” the yew-tree is meant.[3]\r\n\r\n[2] Pliny, xxv. 5.\r\n\r\n[3] _De Bello Gallico_, vi. 31.\r\n\r\nThe poisonous properties of certain fungi were also known. Nicander\r\ncalls the venomous mushrooms the “evil fermentation of the earth,” and\r\nprescribes the identical antidotes which we would perhaps give at the\r\npresent time--viz., vinegar and alkaline carbonates.\r\n\r\n3. =Mineral Poisons.=--Arsenic has been already alluded to. The ancients\r\nused it as a caustic and depilatory. Copper was known as sulphate and\r\noxide; mercury only as cinnabar: lead oxides were used, and milk and\r\nolive-oil prescribed as an antidote for their poisonous properties. The\r\n_poison-lehre_ for many ages was considered as something forbidden.\r\nGalen, in his treatise “On Antidotes,” remarks that the only authors who\r\ndared to treat of poisons were Orpheus, Theologus, Morus, Mendesius the\r\nyounger, Heliodorus of Athens, Aratus, and a few others; but none of\r\nthese treatises have come down to us. From the close similarity of the\r\namount of information in the treatises of Nicander, Dioscorides, Pliny,\r\nGalen, and Paulus Ægineta, it is probable that all were derived from a\r\ncommon source.\r\n\r\n§ 4. If we turn our attention to early Asiatic history, a very cursory\r\nglance at the sacred writings of the East will prove how soon the art of\r\npoisoning, especially in India, was used for the purpose of suicide,\r\nrevenge, or robbery.\r\n\r\nThe ancient practice of the Hindoo widow--self-immolation on the burning\r\npile of her husband--is ascribed to the necessity which the Brahmins\r\nwere under of putting a stop to the crime of domestic poisoning. Every\r\nlittle conjugal quarrel was liable to be settled by this form of secret\r\nassassination, but such a law, as might be expected, checked the\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nPoison was not used to remove human beings alone, for there has been\r\nfrom time immemorial in India much cattle-poisoning. In the Institutes\r\nof Menu, it is ordained that when cattle die the herdsman shall carry to\r\nhis master their ears, their hides, their tails, the skin below their\r\nnavels, their tendons, and the liquor oozing from their foreheads.\r\nWithout doubt these regulations were directed against cattle-poisoners.\r\n\r\nThe poisons known to the Asiatics were arsenic, aconite, opium, and\r\nvarious solanaceous plants. There has been a myth floating through the\r\nages that a poison exists which will slay a long time after its\r\nintroduction. All modern authors have treated the matter as an\r\nexaggerated legend, but, for my own part, I see no reason why it should\r\nnot, in reality, be founded on fact. There is little doubt that the\r\nAsiatic poisoners were well acquainted with the infectious qualities of\r\ncertain fevers and malignant diseases. Now, these very malignant\r\ndiseases answer precisely to the description of a poison which has no\r\nimmediate effects. Plant small-pox in the body of a man, and for a whole\r\nfortnight he walks about, well and hearty. Clothe a person with a\r\ngarment soaked in typhus, and the same thing occurs--for many days there\r\nwill be no sign of failure. Again, the gipsies, speaking a tongue which\r\nis essentially a deformed _prakrit_, and therefore Indian in origin,\r\nhave long possessed a knowledge of the properties of the curious “_mucor\r\nphycomyces_.” This was considered an alga by Agaron, but Berkeley\r\nreferred it to the fungi. The gipsies are said to have administered the\r\nspores of this fungi in warm water. In this way they rapidly attach\r\nthemselves to the mucous membrane of the throat, all the symptoms of a\r\nphthisis follow, and death takes place in from two to three weeks. Mr\r\nBerkeley informed me that he has seen specimens growing on broth which\r\nhad been rejected from the stomach, and that it develops in enormous\r\nquantities on oil-casks and walls impregnated with grease. The filaments\r\nare long, from 12 to 18 inches, and it is capable of very rapid\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nThere is also a modern poison, which, in certain doses, dooms the\r\nunfortunate individual to a terrible malady, simulating, to a\r\nconsiderable extent, natural disease,--that is phosphorus. This poison\r\nwas, however, unknown until some time in the eleventh century, when\r\nAlchid Becher, blindly experimenting on the distillation of urine and\r\ncarbon, obtained his “_escarboucle_,” and passed away without knowing\r\nthe importance of his discovery, which, like so many others, had to be\r\nrediscovered at a later period.\r\n\r\n§ 5. The Hebrews were acquainted with certain poisons, the exact nature\r\nof which is not quite clear. The words “_rosch_” and “_chema_” seem to\r\nbe used occasionally as a generic term for poison, and sometimes to mean\r\na specific thing; “_rosch_,” especially, is used to signify some\r\npoisonous parasitic plant. They knew yellow arsenic under the name of\r\n“_sam_,” aconite under the name of “_boschka_,” and possibly “_son_”\r\nmeans _ergot_.[4] In the later period of their history, when they were\r\ndispersed through various nations, they would naturally acquire the\r\nknowledge of those nations, without losing their own.\r\n\r\n[4] R. J. Wunderbar, _Biblisch-talmudische Medicin_. Leipzig, 1850-60.\r\n\r\n§ 6. The part that poison has played in history is considerable. The\r\npharmaceutical knowledge of the ancients is more graphically and\r\nterribly shown in the deaths of Socrates, Demosthenes, Hannibal, and\r\nCleopatra, than in the pages of the older writers on poisons.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Artaxerxes II. (Memnon), (B.C. 405-359), Phrysa poisoned\r\nthe queen Statira by cutting food with a knife poisoned on one side\r\nonly. Although this has been treated as an idle tale, yet two poisons,\r\naconite and arsenic, were at least well known; either of these could\r\nhave been in the way mentioned introduced in sufficient quantity into\r\nfood to destroy life.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the Christian era professional poisoners arose, and\r\nfor a long time exercised their trade with impunity. Poisoning was so\r\nmuch in use as a political engine that Agrippina (A.D. 26) refused to\r\neat of some apples offered to her at table by her father-in-law,\r\nTiberius.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that the infamous Locusta flourished. She is said to\r\nhave supplied, with suitable directions, the poison by which Agrippina\r\ngot rid of Claudius; and the same woman was the principal agent in the\r\npreparation of the poison that was administered to Britannicus, by order\r\nof his brother Nero. The details of this interesting case have been\r\nrecorded with some minuteness.\r\n\r\nIt was the custom of the Romans to drink hot water, a draught nauseous\r\nenough to us, but, from fashion or habit, considered by them a luxury;\r\nand, as no two men’s tastes are alike, great skill was shown by the\r\nslaves in bringing the water to exactly that degree of heat which their\r\nrespective masters found agreeable.[5]\r\n\r\n[5] Tacitus, lib. xii., xiii. Mentioned also by Juvenal and Suetonius.\r\n\r\nThe children of the Imperial house, with others of the great Roman\r\nfamilies, sat at the banquets at a smaller side table, while their\r\nparents reclined at the larger. A slave brings hot water to Britannicus;\r\nit is too hot; Britannicus refuses it. The slave adds cold water; and it\r\nis this cold water that is supposed to have been poisoned; in any case,\r\nBritannicus had no sooner drunk of it than he lost voice and\r\nrespiration. Agrippina, his mother, was struck with terror, as well as\r\nOctavia, his sister. Nero, the author of the crime, looks coldly on,\r\nsaying that such fits often happened to him in infancy without evil\r\nresult; and after a few moments’ silence the banquet goes on as before.\r\nIf this were not sudden death from heart or brain disease, the poison\r\nmust have been either a cyanide or prussic acid.\r\n\r\nIn those times no autopsy was possible: although the Alexandrian school,\r\nsome 300 years before Christ, had dissected both the living and the\r\ndead, the work of Herophilus and Erasistratus had not been pursued, and\r\nthe great Roman and Greek writers knew only the rudiments of human\r\nanatomy, while, as to pathological changes and their true\r\ninterpretation, their knowledge may be said to have been absolutely\r\n_nil_. It was not, indeed, until the fifteenth century that the Popes,\r\nsilencing ancient scruples, authorised dissections; and it was not until\r\nthe sixteenth century that Vesalius, the first worthy of being\r\nconsidered a great anatomist, arose. In default of pathological\r\nknowledge, the ancients attached great importance to mere outward marks\r\nand discolorations. They noted with special attention spots and\r\nlividity, and supposed that poisons singled out the heart for some quite\r\npeculiar action, altering its substance in such a manner that it\r\nresisted the action of the funeral pyre, and remained unconsumed. It\r\nmay, then, fairly be presumed that many people must have died from\r\npoison without suspicion, and still more from the sudden effects of\r\nlatent disease, ascribed wrongfully to poison. For example, the death of\r\nAlexander was generally at that time ascribed to poison; but Littré has\r\nfairly proved that the great emperor, debilitated by his drinking\r\nhabits, caught a malarious fever in the marshes around Babylon, and died\r\nafter eleven days’ illness. If, added to sudden death, the body, from\r\nany cause, entered into rapid putrefaction, such signs were considered\r\nby the people absolutely conclusive of poisoning: this belief, indeed,\r\nprevailed up to the middle of the seventeenth century, and lingers still\r\namong the uneducated at the present day. Thus, when Britannicus died, an\r\nextraordinary lividity spread over the face of the corpse, which they\r\nattempted to conceal by painting the face. When Pope Alexander VI. died,\r\nprobably enough from poison, his body (according to Guicciardini) became\r\na frightful spectacle--it was livid, bloated, and deformed; the gorged\r\ntongue entirely filled the mouth; from the nose flowed putrid pus, and\r\nthe stench was horrible in the extreme.\r\n\r\nAll these effects of decomposition, we know, are apt to arise in coarse,\r\nobese bodies, and accompany both natural and unnatural deaths; indeed,\r\nif we look strictly at the matter, putting on one side the preservative\r\neffects of certain metallic poisons, it may be laid down that generally\r\nthe corpses of those dying from poison are _less_ apt to decompose\r\nrapidly than those dying from disease--this for the simple reason that a\r\nmajority of diseases cause changes in the fluids and tissues, which\r\nrender putrefactive changes more active, while, as a rule, those who\r\ntake poison are suddenly killed, with their fluids and tissues fairly\r\nhealthy.\r\n\r\nWhen the Duke of Burgundy desired to raise a report that John, Dauphin\r\nof France, was poisoned (1457), he described the imaginary event as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n“One evening our most redoubtable lord and nephew fell so grievously\r\nsick that he died forthwith. His lips, tongue, and face were swollen;\r\nhis eyes started out of his head. It was a horrible sight to see--for so\r\nlook people that are poisoned.”\r\n\r\nThe favourite powder of the professional poisoner, arsenic, was known to\r\ncrowned heads in the fourteenth century; and there has come down to us a\r\ncurious document, drawn out by Charles le Mauvais, King of Navarre. It\r\nis a commission of murder, given to a certain Woudreton, to poison\r\nCharles VI., the Duke of Valois, brother of the king, and his uncles,\r\nthe Dukes of Berry, Burgundy, and Bourbon:--\r\n\r\n“Go thou to Paris; thou canst do great service if thou wilt: do what I\r\ntell thee; I will reward thee well. Thou shalt do thus: There is a thing\r\nwhich is called sublimed arsenic; if a man eat a bit the size of a pea\r\nhe will never survive. Thou wilt find it in Pampeluna, Bordeaux,\r\nBayonne, and in all the good towns through which thou wilt pass, at the\r\napothecaries’ shops. Take it and powder it; and when thou shalt be in\r\nthe house of the king, of the Count de Valois, his brother, the Dukes of\r\nBerry, Burgundy, and Bourbon, draw near, and betake thyself to the\r\nkitchen, to the larder, to the cellar, or any other place where thy\r\npoint can be best gained, and put the powder in the soups, meats, or\r\nwines, provided that thou canst do it secretly. Otherwise, do it not.”\r\nWoudreton was detected, and executed in 1384.[6]\r\n\r\n[6] _Trésor de Chartes._ Charles de Navarre. P. Mortonval, vol. ii. p.\r\n384.\r\n\r\nA chapter might be written entitled “royal poisoners.” King Charles IX.\r\neven figures as an experimentalist.[7] An unfortunate cook has stolen\r\ntwo silver spoons, and, since there was a question whether “_Bezoar_”\r\nwas an antidote or not, the king administers to the cook a lethal dose\r\nof corrosive sublimate, and follows it up with the antidote; but the man\r\ndies in seven hours, although Paré also gives him oil. Truly a grim\r\nbusiness!\r\n\r\n[7] _Œuvres de Paré_, 2nd ed., liv. xx. _Des Vennes_, chap. xliv. p.\r\n507.\r\n\r\nThe subtle method of removing troublesome subjects has been more often\r\npractised on the Continent than in England, yet the English throne in\r\nolden time is not quite free from this stain.[8] The use of poison is\r\nwholly opposed to the Anglo-Saxon method of thought. To what anger the\r\npeople were wrought on detecting poisoners, is seen in the fact that, in\r\n1542, a young woman was boiled alive in Smithfield for poisoning three\r\nhouseholds.[9]\r\n\r\n[8] For example, King John is believed to have poisoned Maud Fitzwalter\r\nby “a poisoned egg.”\r\n\r\n“In the reign of King John, the White Tower received one of the first\r\nand fairest of a long line of female victims in that Maud Fitzwalter who\r\nwas known to the singers of her time as Maud the Fair. The father of\r\nthis beautiful girl was Robert, Lord Fitzwalter, of Castle Baynard, on\r\nthe Thames, one of John’s greatest barons. Yet the king, during a fit of\r\nviolence with the queen, fell madly in love with this young girl. As\r\nneither the lady herself nor her powerful sire would listen to his\r\ndisgraceful suit, the king is said to have seized her by force at\r\nDunmow, and brought her to the Tower. Fitzwalter raised an outcry, on\r\nwhich the king sent troops into Castle Baynard and his other houses; and\r\nwhen the baron protested against these wrongs, his master banished him\r\nfrom the realm. Fitzwalter fled to France with his wife and his other\r\nchildren, leaving his daughter Maud in the Tower, where she suffered a\r\ndaily insult in the king’s unlawful suit. On her proud and scornful\r\nanswer to his passion being heard, John carried her up to the roof, and\r\nlocked her in the round turret, standing on the north-east angle of the\r\nkeep. Maud’s cage was the highest, chilliest den in the Tower; but\r\nneither cold, nor solitude, nor hunger could break her strength. In the\r\nrage of his disappointed love, the king sent one of his minions to her\r\nroom with a poisoned egg, of which the brave girl ate and died.”--_Her\r\nMajesty’s Tower_, by Hepworth Dixon. Lond., 1869; i. p. 46.\r\n\r\n[9] “This yeare, the 17th of March, was boyled in Smithfield one\r\nMargaret Davie, a mayden, which had pouysoned 3 householdes that she\r\ndwelled in. One being her mistress, which dyed of the same, and one\r\nDarington and his wyfe, which she also dwelled with in Coleman Street,\r\nwhich dyed of the same, and also one Tinleys, which dyed also of the\r\nsame.”--Wriotherley’s _Chronicle_, A.D. 1542.\r\n\r\n§ 7. Two great criminal schools arose from the fifteenth to the\r\nseventeenth centuries in Venice and Italy. The Venetian poisoners are of\r\nearlier date than the Italian, and flourished chiefly in the fifteenth\r\ncentury. Here we have the strange spectacle, not of the depravity of\r\nindividuals, but of the government of the State formally recognising\r\nsecret assassination by poison, and proposals to remove this or that\r\nprince, duke, or emperor, as a routine part of their deliberations.\r\nStill more curious and unique, the dark communings of “_the council of\r\nten_” were recorded in writing, and the number of those who voted for\r\nand who voted against the proposed crime, the reason for the\r\nassassination, and the sum to be paid, still exist in shameless black\r\nand white. Those who desire to study this branch of secret history may\r\nbe referred to a small work by Carl Hoff, which gives a brief account of\r\nwhat is known of the proceedings of the council. One example will here\r\nsuffice. On the 15th of December 1513 a Franciscan brother, John of\r\nRagubo, offered a selection of poisons, and declared himself ready to\r\nremove any objectionable person out of the way. For the first successful\r\ncase he required a pension of 1500 ducats yearly, which was to be\r\nincreased on the execution of future services. The presidents, Girolando\r\nDuoda and Pietro Guiarina, placed the matter before the “ten” on the 4th\r\nof January 1514, and on a division (10 against 5) it was resolved to\r\naccept so patriotic an offer, and to experiment first on the Emperor\r\nMaximilian. The bond laid before the “ten” contained a regular\r\ntariff--for the great Sultan 500 ducats, for the King of Spain 150\r\nducats, but the journey and other expenses were in each case to be\r\ndefrayed; the Duke of Milan was rated at 60, the Marquis of Mantua at\r\n50, the Pope could be removed at 100 ducats. The curious offer thus\r\nconcludes:--“The farther the journey, the more eminent the man, the more\r\nit is necessary to reward the toil and hardships undertaken, and the\r\nheavier must be the payment.” The council appear to have quietly\r\narranged thus to take away the lives of many public men, but their\r\nefforts were only in a few cases successful. When the deed was done, it\r\nwas registered by a single marginal note, “_factum_.”\r\n\r\nWhat drugs the Venetian poisoners used is uncertain. The Italians\r\nbecame notorious in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries for their\r\nknowledge of poisons, partly from the deeds of Toffana and others, and\r\npartly from the works of J. Baptista Porta, who wrote a very\r\ncomprehensive treatise, under the title of _Natural Magic_,[10] and\r\nmanaged to slide into the text, in the sections on cooking (_De Re\r\nCoquinaria_, lib. xiv.), a mass of knowledge as to the preparation of\r\npoisons. There are prescriptions that little accord with the title,\r\nunless indeed the trades of cook and poisoner were the same. He gives a\r\nmethod of drugging wine with belladonna root, for the purpose of making\r\nthe loaded guest loathe drink; he also gives a list of solanaceous\r\nplants, and makes special mention of nux vomica, aconite, veratrum, and\r\nmezereon. Again, in the section (_De Ancupio_, lib. xv.) he gives a\r\nrecipe for a very strong poison which he calls “_venenum lupinum_;” it\r\nis to be made of the powdered leaves of _Aconitum lycoctonum_, _Taxus\r\nbaccata_, powdered glass, caustic lime, sulphide of arsenic, and bitter\r\nalmonds, the whole to be mixed with honey, and made into pills the size\r\nof a hazel-nut.\r\n\r\n[10] J. Bapt. Porta, born 1537, died 1615. _Neapolitani Magiæ\r\nNaturalis._ Neapoli, 1589.\r\n\r\nIn the section _De Medicis Experimentis_ he gives a process to poison a\r\nsleeping person: the recipe is curious, and would certainly not have the\r\nintended effect. A mixture of hemlock juice, bruised datura, stramonium,\r\nbelladonna, and opium is placed in a leaden box with a perfectly fitting\r\ncover, and fermented for several days; it is then opened under the nose\r\nof the sleeper. Possibly Porta had experimented on small animals, and\r\nhad found that such matters, when fermented, exhaled enough carbonic\r\nacid gas to kill them, and imagined, therefore, that the same thing\r\nwould happen if applied to the human subject. However this may be, the\r\naccount which Porta gives of the effects of the solanaceous plants, and\r\nthe general tone of the work, amply prove that he was no theorist, but\r\nhad studied practically the actions of poisons.\r\n\r\nThe iniquitous Toffana (or Tophana) made solutions of arsenious acid of\r\nvarying strength, and sold these solutions in phials under the name of\r\n“_Acquetta di Napoli_” for many years. She is supposed to have poisoned\r\nmore than 600 persons, among whom were two Popes--viz., Pius III. and\r\nClement XIV. The composition of the Naples water was long a profound\r\nsecret, but is said to have been known by the reigning Pope and by the\r\nEmperor Charles VI. The latter told the secret to Dr Garelli, his\r\nphysician, who, again, imparted the knowledge to the famous Friedrich\r\nHoffman in a letter still extant. Toffana was brought to justice in\r\n1709, but, availing herself of the immunity afforded by convents,\r\nescaped punishment, and continued to sell her wares for twenty years\r\nafterwards. When Kepfer[11] was in Italy he found her in a prison at\r\nNaples, and many people visited her, as a sort of lion (1730). With the\r\n_Acqua Toffana_, the “_Acquetta di Perugia_” played at the same time its\r\npart. It is said to have been prepared by killing a hog, disjointing the\r\nsame, strewing the pieces with white arsenic, which was well rubbed in,\r\nand then collecting the juice which dropped from the meat; this juice\r\nwas considered far more poisonous than an ordinary solution of arsenic.\r\nThe researches of Selmi on compounds containing arsenic, produced when\r\nanimal bodies decompose in arsenical fluids, lend reason and support to\r\nthis view; and probably the juice would not only be very poisonous, but\r\nact in a different manner, and exhibit symptoms different from those of\r\nordinary arsenical poisoning. Toffana had disciples; she taught the art\r\nto Hieronyma Spara, who formed an association of young married women\r\nduring the popedom of Alexander VII.; these were detected on their own\r\nconfession.[12]\r\n\r\n[11] Kepfer’s _Travels_. Lond., 1758.\r\n\r\n[12] Le Bret’s _Magazin zu Gebrauche der Staat u. Kirchen-Geschichte_,\r\nTheil 4. Frankfort and Leipzig, 1774.\r\n\r\nContemporaneously with Toffana, another Italian, Keli, devoted himself\r\nto similar crimes. This man had expended much as an adept searching for\r\nthe philosopher’s stone, and sought to indemnify himself by entering\r\nupon what must have been a profitable business. He it was who instructed\r\nM. de St. Croix in the properties of arsenic; and St. Croix, in his\r\nturn, imparted the secret to his paramour, Madame de Brinvilliers. This\r\nwoman appears to have been as cold-blooded as Toffana; she is said to\r\nhave experimented on the patients at the Hôtel Dieu, in order to\r\nascertain the strength of her powders, and to have invented “les poudres\r\nde succession.” She poisoned her father, brothers, sister, and others of\r\nher family; but a terrible fate overtook both her and St. Croix. The\r\nlatter was suffocated by some poisonous matters he was preparing, and\r\nMadame de Brinvilliers’ practices having become known, she was obliged\r\nto take refuge in a convent. Here she was courted by a police officer\r\ndisguised as an abbé, lured out of the convent, and, in this way brought\r\nto justice, was beheaded[13] and burnt near Nôtre Dame, in the middle\r\nof the reign of Louis XIV.[14]\r\n\r\n[13] The Marchioness was imprisoned in the Conciergerie and tortured.\r\nVictor Hugo, describing the rack in that prison, says, “The Marchioness\r\nde Brinvilliers was stretched upon it stark naked, fastened down, so to\r\nspeak, quartered by four chains attached to the four limbs, and there\r\nsuffered the frightful extraordinary torture by water,” which caused her\r\nto ask “How are you going to contrive to put that great barrel of water\r\nin this little body?”--_Things seen by Victor Hugo_, vol. i.\r\n\r\nThe water torture was this:--a huge funnel-like vessel was fitted on to\r\nthe neck, the edge of the funnel coming up to the eyes; on now pouring\r\nwater into the funnel so that the fluid rises above the nose and mouth,\r\nthe poor wretch is bound to swallow the fluid or die of suffocation; if\r\nindeed the sufferer resolve to be choked, in the first few moments of\r\nunconsciousness the fluid is swallowed automatically, and air again\r\nadmitted to the lungs; it is therefore obvious that in this way\r\nprodigious quantities of fluid might be taken.\r\n\r\n[14] For the court of poisoners (_chambre ardente_) and the histories of\r\nSt. Croix, De Brinvilliers, the priest Le Sage, the women La Voisin, and\r\nLa Vigoureux, the reader may be referred to Voltaire’s _Siècle de Louis\r\nXIV._, Madame de Sévigné’s _Lettres_, Martinière’s _Hist. de la Règne de\r\nLouis XIV._, Strutzel, _De Venenis_, &c.\r\n\r\nThe numerous attempts of the Italian and Venetian poisoners on the lives\r\nof monarchs and eminent persons cast for a long time a cloud over regal\r\ndomestic peace. Bullets and daggers were not feared, but in their place\r\nthe dish of meat, the savoury pasty, and the red wine were regarded as\r\npossible carriers of death. No better example of this dread can be found\r\nthan, at so late a period as the reign of Henry VII.,[15] the\r\nextraordinary precautions thought necessary for preserving the infant\r\nPrince of Wales.\r\n\r\n[15] Henry VIII., at one time of his life, was (or pretended to be)\r\napprehensive of being poisoned; it was, indeed, a common belief of his\r\ncourt that Anne Boleyn attempted to dose him. “The king, in an interview\r\nwith young Prince Henry, burst into tears, saying that he and his sister\r\n(meaning the Princess Mary) might thank God for having escaped from the\r\nhands of that accursed and venomous harlot, who had intended to poison\r\nthem.”--_A Chronicle of England during the Reign of the Tudors_, by W.\r\nJ. Hamilton. Introduction, p. xxi.\r\n\r\n“No person, of whatsoever rank, except the regular attendants in the\r\nnursery, should approach the cradle, except with an order from the\r\nking’s hand. The food supplied to the child was to be largely\r\n‘_assayed_,’ and his clothes were to be washed by his own servants, and\r\nno other hand might touch them. The material was to be submitted to all\r\ntests. The chamberlain and vice-chamberlain must be present, morning and\r\nevening, when the prince was washed and dressed, and nothing of any kind\r\nbought for the use of the nursery might be introduced until it was\r\nwashed and perfumed. No person, not even the domestics of the palace,\r\nmight have access to the prince’s rooms except those who were specially\r\nappointed to them, nor might any member of the household approach\r\nLondon, for fear of their catching and conveying infection.”[16]\r\n\r\n[16] Froude’s _History of England_, vol. iii. p. 262.\r\n\r\nHowever brief and imperfect the foregoing historical sketch of the part\r\nthat poison has played may be, it is useful in showing the absolute\r\nnecessity of a toxicological science--a science embracing many branches\r\nof knowledge. If it is impossible now for Toffanas, Locustas, and other\r\nspecimens of a depraved humanity to carry on their crimes without\r\ndetection; if poison is the very last form of death feared by eminent\r\npolitical persons; it is not so much owing to a different state of\r\nsociety, as to the more exact scientific knowledge which is applied\r\nduring life to the discrimination of symptoms, distinguishing between\r\nthose resulting from disease and those due to injurious substances, and\r\nafter death to a highly developed pathology, which has learned, by\r\nmultiplied observations, all the normal and abnormal signs in tissues\r\nand organs; and, finally, to an ever-advancing chemistry, which is able\r\nin many instances to separate and detect the hurtful and noxious thing,\r\nalthough hid for months deep in the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--Growth and Development of the Modern Methods of Chemically\r\nDetecting Poisons.\r\n\r\n§ 8. The history of the detection of poisons has gone through several\r\nphases. The first phase has already been incidentally touched\r\nupon--_i.e._, detection by antecedent and surrounding circumstances,\r\naided sometimes by experiments on animals. If the death was sudden, if\r\nthe post-mortem decomposition was rapid, poison was indicated: sometimes\r\na portion of the food last eaten, or the suspected thing, would be given\r\nto an animal; if the animal also died, such accumulation of proof would\r\nrender the matter beyond doubt. The modern toxicologists are more\r\nsceptical, for even the last test is not of itself satisfactory. It is\r\nnow known that meat may become filled with bacilli and produce rapid\r\ndeath, and yet no poison, as such, has been added.\r\n\r\nIn the next phase, the doctors were permitted to dissect, and to\r\nfamiliarise themselves with pathological appearances. This was a great\r\nstep gained: the apoplexies, heart diseases, perforations of the\r\nstomach, and fatal internal hæmorrhages could no longer be ascribed to\r\npoison. If popular clamour made a false accusation, there was more\r\nchance of a correct judgment. It was not until the end of the eighteenth\r\nand the beginning of the present century, however, that chemistry was\r\nfar enough advanced to test for the more common mineral poisons; the\r\nmodern phase was then entered on, and toxicology took a new departure.\r\n\r\n§ 9. From the treatise of Barthélémy d’Anglais[17] in the thirteenth\r\ncentury (in which he noticed the poisonous properties of quicksilver\r\nvapour), up to the end of the fifteenth century, there are numerous\r\ntreatises upon poison, most of which are mere learned compilations, and\r\nscarcely repay perusal. In the sixteenth century, there are a few works,\r\nsuch, for example, as Porta, which partook of the general advancement of\r\nscience, and left behind the stereotyped doctrine of the old classical\r\nschools.[18]\r\n\r\n[17] _De Rerum Proprietaribus._\r\n\r\n[18] In the sixteenth century it was not considered proper to write upon\r\npoisons. Jerome Cardan declared a poisoner worse than a brigand, “and\r\nthat is why I have refused not only to teach or experiment on such\r\nthings, but even to know them.”--_J. Cardan: De Subtilitate_. Basel,\r\n1558.\r\n\r\nIn the seventeenth century the Honourable Robert Boyle made some shrewd\r\nobservations, bearing on toxicology, in his work on “The usefulness of\r\nNatural Philosophy,” &c.: Oxford, 1664. Nicolas L’Emery also wrote a\r\n_Cours de Chimie_,--quite an epitome of the chemical science of the\r\ntime.[19]\r\n\r\n[19] _Cours de Chimie, contenant la manière de faire les opérations qui\r\nsont en usage dans la Médecine._ Paris, 1675.\r\n\r\nIn the eighteenth century still further advances were made. Richard Mead\r\npublished his ingenious _Mechanical Theory of Poisons_. Great chemists\r\narose--Stahl, Marggraf, Brandt, Bergmann, Scheele, Berthollet,\r\nPriestley, and lastly, Lavoisier--and chemistry, as a science, was born.\r\nOf the chemists quoted, Scheele, in relation to toxicology, stands\r\nchief. It was Scheele who discovered prussic acid,[20] without, however,\r\nnoting its poisonous properties; the same chemist separated oxalic acid\r\nfrom sorrel,[21] and made the important discovery that arsenic united\r\nwith hydrogen, forming a fœtid gas, and, moreover, that this gas could\r\nbe decomposed by heat.[22] From this observation, a delicate test for\r\narsenic was afterwards elaborated, which for the first time rendered the\r\nmost tasteless and easily administered poison in the whole world at once\r\nthe easiest of detection. The further history of what is now called\r\n“Marsh’s Test” is as follows:--\r\n\r\n[20] _Opuscula Chemica_, vol. ii. pp. 148-174.\r\n\r\n[21] _De Terra Rhubarbi et Acido Acetosellæ._ _Nova Acta Acad. Veg.\r\nSued. Anni_, 1784. _Opuscula Chemica_, vol. ii. pp. 187-195.\r\n\r\nBergmann first described oxalic acid as obtained by the oxidation of\r\nsaccharine bodies; but Scheele recognised its identity with the acid\r\ncontained in sorrel.\r\n\r\n[22] _Mémoires de Scheele_, t. i., 1775.\r\n\r\n§ 10. Proust[23] observed that a very fœtid hydrogen gas was disengaged\r\nwhen arsenical tin was dissolved in hydrochloric acid, and that arsenic\r\nwas deposited from the inflamed gas on cold surfaces which the flame\r\ntouched. Trommsdorff next announced, in 1803, that when arsenical zinc\r\nwas introduced into an ordinary flask with water and sulphuric acid, an\r\narsenical hydrogen was disengaged; and if the tube was sufficiently\r\nlong, arsenic was deposited on its walls.[24] Stromeyer, Gay-Lussac,\r\nThénard, Gehlen, and Davy later studied this gas, and Serullas in 1821\r\nproposed this reaction as a toxicological test. Lastly, in 1836, Marsh\r\npublished his Memoir.[25] He elaborated a special apparatus of great\r\nsimplicity, developed hydrogen by means of zinc and sulphuric acid,\r\ninflamed the issuing gas, and obtained any arsenic present as a metal,\r\nwhich could be afterwards converted into arsenious acid, &c.\r\n\r\n[23] Proust, _Annales de Chimie_, t. xxviii., 1798.\r\n\r\n[24] _Nicholson’s Journal_, vol. vi.\r\n\r\n[25] “Description of a New Process of Separating Small Quantities of\r\nArsenic from Substances with which it is mixed.” _Ed. New. Phil.\r\nJournal_, 1836.\r\n\r\nThis brief history of the so-called “Marsh’s Test” amply shows that\r\nMarsh was not the discoverer of the test. Like many other useful\r\nprocesses, it seems to have been evolved by a combination of many minds.\r\nIt may, however, be truly said that Marsh was the first who perfected\r\nthe test and brought it prominently forward.\r\n\r\n§ 11. Matthieu Joseph Bonaventura Orfila must be considered the father\r\nof modern toxicology. His great work, _Traité de Toxicologie_, was first\r\npublished in 1814, and went through many editions. Orfila’s chief merit\r\nwas the discovery that poisons were absorbed and accumulated in certain\r\ntissues--a discovery which bore immediate fruit, and greatly extended\r\nthe means of seeking poisons. Before the time of Orfila, a chemist not\r\nfinding anything in the stomach would not have troubled to examine the\r\nliver, the kidney, the brain, or the blood. The immense number of\r\nexperiments which Orfila undertook is simply marvellous. Some are of\r\nlittle value, and teach nothing accurately as to the action of\r\npoisons--as, for example, many of those in which he tied the gullet in\r\norder to prevent vomiting, for such are experiments under entirely\r\nunnatural conditions; but there are still a large number which form the\r\nvery basis of our pathological knowledge.\r\n\r\nOrfila’s method of experiment was usually to take weighed or measured\r\nquantities of poison, to administer them to animals, and then after\r\ndeath--first carefully noting the changes in the tissues and organs--to\r\nattempt to recover by chemical means the poison administered. In this\r\nway he detected and recovered nearly all the organic and inorganic\r\npoisons then known; and most of his processes are, with modifications\r\nand improvements, in use at the present time.[26]\r\n\r\n[26] Orfila’s chief works are as follows:--\r\n\r\n_Traité de Toxicologie._ 2 vols. 8vo.

The discovery of the alkaloids at the commencement of this century\r\ncertainly gave the poisoner new weapons; yet the same processes\r\n(slightly modified) which separated the alkaloids from plants also\r\nserved to separate them from the human body. In 1803 Derosne discovered\r\nnarcotine and morphine, but he neither recognised the difference between\r\nthese two substances, nor their basic properties. Sertürner from 1805\r\ndevoted himself to the study of opium, and made a series of discoveries.\r\nRobiquet, in 1807, recognised the basic characters of narcotine. In 1818\r\nPelletier and Caventou separated strychnine; in 1819 brucine; and in the\r\nsame year delphinine was discovered simultaneously by Brande, Lassaigne,\r\nand Feneuille. Coniine was recognised by Giesecke in 1827, and in the\r\nfollowing year, 1828, nicotine was separated by Reimann and Posselt. In\r\n1832 Robiquet discovered codeine; and in 1833 atropine, aconitine, and\r\nhyoscyamine were distinguished by Geiger and Hesse. Since then, every\r\nyear has been marked by the separation of some new alkaloid, from either\r\nanimal or vegetable substances. So many workers in different countries\r\nnow began to study and improve toxicology, that it would exceed the\r\nlimits and be foreign to the scope of this treatise to give even a brief\r\n_résumé_ of their labours. It may, notwithstanding, be useful to append\r\na short bibliography of the chief works on toxicology of the present\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n§ 13.--BIBLIOGRAPHY OF THE CHIEF WORKS ON TOXICOLOGY (NINETEENTH\r\nCENTURY).\r\n\r\n    ANGLADA, JOS.--“Traité de Toxicologie Générale, &c.” Montpellier et\r\n    Paris, 1835.\r\n\r\n    AUTENRIETH.--“Kurze Anleitung zur Auffindung der Gifte.” Freiburg,\r\n    1892.\r\n\r\n    BANDLIN, O.--“Die Gifte.” Basel, 1869-1873.\r\n\r\n    BAUMERT, G.--“Lehrbuch der gerichtl.

The term “_Poison_” may be considered first in its legal, as\r\ndistinct from its scientific, aspect.\r\n\r\n_The legal definition_ of “poison” is to be gathered from the various\r\nstatute-books of civilised nations.\r\n\r\nThe English law enacts that: “Whoever shall administer, or cause to be\r\nadministered to, or taken by any person, any poison or other destructive\r\nthing, with intent to commit murder, shall be guilty of felony.”\r\n\r\nFurther, by the Criminal Consolidation Act, 1861: “Whosoever shall, by\r\nany other means other than those specified in any of the preceding\r\nsections of this Act, attempt to commit murder, shall be guilty of\r\nfelony.”\r\n\r\nIt is therefore evident that, by implication, the English law defines a\r\npoison to be a destructive thing administered to, or taken by, a person,\r\nand it must necessarily include, not only poisons which act on account\r\nof their inherent chemical and other properties after absorption into\r\nthe blood, but mechanical irritants, and also specifically-tainted\r\nfluids. Should, for example, a person give to another milk, or other\r\nfluid, knowing, at the same time, that such fluid is contaminated by the\r\nspecific poison of scarlet fever, typhoid, or any serious malady capable\r\nof being thus conveyed, I believe that such an offence could be brought\r\nunder the first of the sections quoted. In fine, the words “_destructive\r\nthing_” are widely applicable, and may be extended to any substance,\r\ngaseous, liquid, or solid, living or dead, which, if capable at all of\r\nbeing taken within the body, may injure or destroy life. According to\r\nthis view, the legal idea of “poison” would include such matters as\r\nboiling water, molten lead, specifically-infected fluids, the flesh of\r\nanimals dying of diseases which may be communicable to man, powdered\r\nglass, diamond dust, &c. Evidence must, however, be given of guilty\r\nintent.\r\n\r\nThe words, “administered to or taken by,” imply obviously that the\r\nframers of the older statute considered the mouth as the only portal of\r\nentrance for criminal poisoning, but the present law effectually guards\r\nagainst any attempt to commit murder, no matter by what means. There is\r\nthus ample provision for all the strange ways by which poison has been\r\nintroduced into the system, whether it be by the ear, nose, brain,\r\nrectum, vagina, or any other conceivable way, so that, to borrow the\r\nwords of Mr. Greaves (_Notes on Criminal Law Consolidation_), “the\r\nmalicious may rest satisfied that every attempt to murder which their\r\nperverted ingenuity may devise, or their fiendish malignity suggest,\r\nwill fall within some clause of this Act, and may be visited with penal\r\nservitude for life.”\r\n\r\nSince poison is often exhibited, not for the purpose of taking life, but\r\nfrom various motives, and to accomplish various ends--as, for example,\r\nto narcotise the robber’s victim (this especially in the East), to quiet\r\nchildren, to create love in the opposite sex (love philters), to detect\r\nthe secret sipper by suitably preparing the wine, to expel the\r\ninconvenient fruit of illicit affection, to cure inebriety by polluting\r\nthe drunkard’s drink with antimony, and, finally, to satisfy an aimless\r\nspirit of mere wantonness and wickedness, the English law enacts “that\r\nwhosoever shall unlawfully or maliciously administer to, or cause to be\r\ntaken by, any other person, any poison or other destructive or noxious\r\nthing, so as thereby to endanger the life of such person, or so as\r\nthereby to inflict upon such person any grievous bodily harm, shall be\r\nguilty of felony.”\r\n\r\nThere is also a special provision, framed, evidently, with reference to\r\nvolatile and stupefying poisons, such as chloroform, tetrachloride of\r\ncarbon, &c.:--\r\n\r\n“Whoever shall unlawfully apply, or administer to, or cause to be taken\r\nby any person, any chloroform, laudanum, or other stupefying or\r\noverpowering drug, matter, or thing, with intent, in any such case,\r\nthereby to enable himself or any other person to commit, or with intent,\r\n&c., to assist any other person in committing, any indictable offence,\r\nshall be guilty of felony.”\r\n\r\n§ 15. The German statute, as with successive amendments it now stands,\r\nenacts as follows:[27]--\r\n\r\n[27] “Wer vorsätzlich einem Andern, um dessen Gesundheit zu beschädigen,\r\nGift oder andere Stoffe beibringt, welche die Gesundheit zu zerstören\r\ngeeignet sind, wird mit Zuchthaus von zwei bis zu zehn Jahren bestraft.\r\n\r\n“Ist durch die Handlung eine schwere Körperverletzung verursacht worden,\r\nso ist auf Zuchthaus nicht unter fünf Jahren, und wenn durch die\r\nHandlung der Tod verursacht worden, auf Zuchthaus nicht unter zehn\r\nJahren oder auf lebenslängliches Zuchthaus zu erkennen.\r\n\r\n“Ist die vorsätzliche rechtswidrige Handlung des Gift--&c.,--Beibringens\r\nauf das ‘Tödten’ gerichtet, soll also durch dieselbe gewollter Weise der\r\nTod eines Anderen herbeigeführt werden, so kommt in betracht: Wer\r\nvorsätzlich einen Menschen tödtet, wird, wenn er die Tödtung mit\r\nUeberlegung ausgeführt hat, wegen Mordes mit dem Tode bestraft.”\r\n\r\n“Whoever wilfully administers (_beibringt_) to a person, for the purpose\r\nof injuring health, poison, or any other substance having the property\r\nof injuring health, will be punished by from two to ten years’\r\nimprisonment.\r\n\r\n“If by such act a serious bodily injury is caused, the imprisonment is\r\nnot to be less than five years; if death is the result, the imprisonment\r\nis to be not under ten years or for life.\r\n\r\n“If the death is wilfully caused by poison, it comes under the general\r\nlaw: ‘Whoever wilfully kills a man, and if the killing is premeditated,\r\nis on account of murder punishable with death.’”\r\n\r\nThe French law runs thus (Art. 301, _Penal Code_):--“Every attempt on\r\nthe life of a person, by the effect of substances which may cause death,\r\nmore or less suddenly, in whatever manner these substances may have been\r\nemployed or administered, and whatever may have been the results, is\r\ncalled poisoning.”[28]\r\n\r\n[28] “Est qualifié _empoisonnement_--tout attentat à la vie d’une\r\npersonne par l’effet de substances qui peuvent donner la mort plus ou\r\nmoins promptement, de quelque manière que ces substances aient été\r\nemployées ou administrées, et quelles qu’en aient été les suites.”--Art.\r\n301, _Penal Code_.\r\n\r\nThere is also a penalty provided against any one who “shall have\r\noccasioned the illness or incapacity for personal work of another, by\r\nthe voluntary administration, in any manner whatever, of substances\r\nwhich, without being of a nature to cause death, are injurious to\r\nhealth.”[29]\r\n\r\n[29] “Celui qui aura occasionné à autrui une maladie ou incapacité de\r\ntravail personnel en lui administrant volontairement, de quelque manière\r\nque ce soit, des substances qui, sans être de nature à donner la mort,\r\nsont nuisibles à la santé.”--Art. 317, _Penal Code_.\r\n\r\n§ 16. =Scientific Definition of a Poison.=--A true scientific definition\r\nof a poison must exclude all those substances which act\r\nmechanically,--the physical influences of heat, light, and electricity;\r\nand parasitic diseases, whether caused by the growth of fungus, or the\r\ninvasion of an organism by animal parasites, as, for example,\r\n“trichinosis,” which are not, so far as we know, associated with any\r\npoisonous product excreted by the parasite;--on the other hand, it is\r\nnow recognised that pathogenic micro-organisms develop poisons, and the\r\nsymptoms of all true infections are but the effects of “toxines.” The\r\ndefinition of poison, in a scientific sense, should be broad enough to\r\ncomprehend not only the human race, but the dual world of life, both\r\nanimal and vegetable.\r\n\r\nHusemann and Kobert are almost the only writers on poisons who have\r\nattempted, with more or less success, to define poison by a\r\ngeneralisation, keeping in view the exclusion of the matters enumerated.\r\nHusemann says--“We define poisons as such inorganic, or organic\r\nsubstances as are in part capable of artificial preparation, in part\r\nexisting, ready-formed, in the animal or vegetable kingdom, which,\r\nwithout being able to reproduce themselves, through the chemical nature\r\nof their molecules under certain conditions, change in the healthy\r\norganism the form and general relationship of the organic parts, and,\r\nthrough annihilation of organs, or destruction of their functions,\r\ninjure health, or, under certain conditions, destroy life.” Kobert\r\nsays:--“Poisons are organic or inorganic unorganised substances\r\noriginating in the organism itself, or introduced into the organism,\r\neither artificially prepared, or ready formed in nature, which through\r\ntheir chemical properties, under certain conditions, so influence the\r\norgans of living beings, that the health of these beings is seriously\r\ninfluenced temporarily or permanently.”\r\n\r\nIn the first edition of this work I made an attempt to define a poison\r\nthus:--_A substance of definite chemical composition, whether mineral or\r\norganic, may be called a poison, if it is capable of being taken into\r\nany living organism, and causes, by its own inherent chemical nature,\r\nimpairment or destruction of function_. I prefer this definition to\r\nKobert’s, and believe that it fairly agrees with what we know of\r\npoisons.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--Classification of Poisons.\r\n\r\n§ 17. At some future time, with a more intimate knowledge of the way in\r\nwhich each poison acts upon the various forms of animal and vegetable\r\nlife, it may be possible to give a truly scientific and philosophical\r\nclassification of poisons--one based neither upon symptoms, upon local\r\neffects, nor upon chemical structure, but upon a collation and\r\ncomparison of all the properties of a poison, whether chemical,\r\nphysical, or physiological. No perfect systematic arrangement is at\r\npresent attainable: we are either compelled to omit all classification,\r\nor else to arrange poisons with a view to practical utility merely.\r\n\r\nFrom the latter point of view, an arrangement simply according to the\r\nmost prominent symptoms is a good one, and, without doubt, an assistance\r\nto the medical man summoned in haste to a case of real or suspected\r\npoisoning. Indeed, under such circumstances, a scheme somewhat similar\r\nto the following, probably occurs to every one versed in toxicology:--\r\n\r\n\r\nA. POISONS CAUSING DEATH IMMEDIATELY, OR IN A FEW MINUTES.\r\n\r\nThere are but few poisons which destroy life in a few minutes. Omitting\r\nthe strong mineral acids, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, with the\r\nirrespirable gases,--_Prussic acid_, _the cyanides_, _oxalic acid_, and\r\noccasionally _strychnine_, are the chief poisons coming under this head.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. IRRITANT POISONS (symptoms mainly pain, vomiting, and purging).\r\n\r\n_Arsenic_, _antimony_, _phosphorus_, _cantharides_, _savin_, _ergot_,\r\n_digitalis_, _colchicum_, _zinc_, _mercury_, _lead_, _copper_, _silver_,\r\n_iron_, _baryta_, _chrome_, _yew_, _laburnum_, _and putrid animal\r\nsubstances._\r\n\r\n\r\nC. IRRITANT AND NARCOTIC POISONS (symptoms those of an irritant nature,\r\nwith the addition of more or less pronounced cerebral indications).\r\n\r\nTo this class more especially belong _oxalic acid_ and _the oxalates_,\r\nwith several poisons belonging to the purely narcotic class, but which\r\nproduce occasionally irritant effects.\r\n\r\n\r\nD. POISONS MORE ESPECIALLY AFFECTING THE NERVOUS SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n1. NARCOTICS (chief symptom insensibility, which may be preceded by more\r\nor less cerebral excitement): _Opium_, _Chloral_, _Chloroform_.\r\n\r\n2. DELIRIANTS (delirium for the most part a prominent symptom):\r\n_Belladonna_, _hyoscyamus_, _stramonium_, _with others of the\r\nSolanaceæ_, to which may be added--_poisonous fungi_, _Indian hemp_,\r\n_lolium temulentum_, _œnanthe crocata_, and _camphor_.\r\n\r\n3. CONVULSIVES.--Almost every poison has been known to produce\r\nconvulsive effects, but the only true convulsive poisons are the\r\n_alkaloids of the strychnos class_.\r\n\r\n4. COMPLEX NERVOUS PHENOMENA: _Aconite_, _digitalis_, _hemlock_,\r\n_calabar bean_, _tobacco_, _lobelia inflata_, and _curara_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n§ 18. KOBERT’S CLASSIFICATION.--The latest authority on\r\npoisons--Kobert--has classified poisons according to the following\r\nscheme:--\r\n\r\n\r\nI. POISONS WHICH CAUSE COARSE ANATOMICAL CHANGES OF THE ORGANS.\r\n\r\n    A. Those which specially irritate the part to which they are\r\n    applied.\r\n\r\n    1. _Acids._\r\n\r\n    2. _Caustic alkalies._\r\n\r\n    3. _Caustic salts_, especially those of the heavy metals.\r\n\r\n    4. Locally irritating organic substances which neither can be\r\n    classified as corrosive acids nor alkalies, nor as corrosive salts;\r\n    such are:--_cantharidine_, _phrynine_, and others in the animal\r\n    kingdom, _croton oil_ and _savin_ in the vegetable kingdom. Locally\r\n    irritating colours, such as the _aniline dyes_.\r\n\r\n    5. Gases and vapours which cause local irritation when breathed,\r\n    such as _ammonia_, _chlorine_, _iodine_, _bromine_, and _sulphur\r\n    dioxide_.\r\n\r\n    B. Those which have but little effect locally, but change\r\n    anatomically other parts of the body; such as _lead_, _phosphorus_,\r\n    and others.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. BLOOD POISONS.\r\n\r\n    1. Blood poisons interfering with the circulation in a purely\r\n    physical manner, such as _peroxide of hydrogen_, _ricine_, _abrine_.\r\n\r\n    2. Poisons which have the property of dissolving the red blood\r\n    corpuscle, such as the _saponins_.\r\n\r\n    3. Poisons which, with or without primary solution of the red blood\r\n    corpuscles, produce in the blood methæmoglobin; such as _potassic\r\n    chlorate_, _hydrazine_, _nitrobenzene_, _aniline_, _picric acid_,\r\n    _carbon disulphide_.\r\n\r\n    4. Poisons having a peculiar action on the colouring matter of the\r\n    blood, or on its decomposition products, such as _hydric sulphide_,\r\n    _hydric cyanide_, and the _cyanides_ and _carbon monoxide_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. POISONS WHICH KILL WITHOUT THE PRODUCTION OF COARSE ANATOMICAL\r\nCHANGE.\r\n\r\n    1. Poisons affecting the cerebro-spinal system; such as\r\n    _chloroform_, _ether_, _nitrous oxide_, _alcohol_, _chloral_,\r\n    _cocaine_, _atropine_, _morphine_, _nicotine_, _coniine_,\r\n    _aconitine_, _strychnine_, _curarine_, and others.\r\n\r\n    2. Heart Poisons; such as, _digitalis_, _helleborin_, _muscarine_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. POISONOUS PRODUCTS OF TISSUE CHANGE.\r\n\r\n    1. Poisonous albumin.\r\n\r\n    2. Poisons developed in food.\r\n\r\n    3. Auto-poisoning, _e.g._ uræmia, glycosuria, oxaluria.\r\n\r\n    4. The more important products of tissue change; such as, _fatty\r\n    acids_, _oxyacids_, _amido-fatty acids_, _amines_, _diamines_, and\r\n    _ptomaines_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n§ 19. I have preferred an arrangement which, as far as possible, follows\r\nthe order in which a chemical expert would search for an unknown\r\npoison--hence an arrangement partly chemical and partly symptomatic.\r\nFirst the chief gases which figure in the mortality statistics are\r\ntreated, and then follow in order other poisons.\r\n\r\nA chemist, given a liquid to examine, would naturally test first its\r\nreaction, and, if strongly alkaline or strongly acid, would at once\r\ndirect his attention to the mineral acids or to the alkalies. In other\r\ncases, he would proceed to separate volatile matters from those that\r\nwere fixed, lest substances such as prussic acid, chloroform, alcohol,\r\nand phosphorus be dissipated or destroyed by his subsequent operations.\r\n\r\nDistillation over, the alkaloids, glucosides, and their allies would\r\nnext be naturally sought, since they can be extracted by alcoholic and\r\nethereal solvents in such a manner as in no way to interfere with an\r\n_after_-search for metals.\r\n\r\nThe metals are last in the list, because by suitable treatment, after\r\nall organic substances are destroyed, either by actual fire or powerful\r\nchemical agencies, even the volatile metals may be recovered. The metals\r\nare arranged very nearly in the same order as that in which they would\r\nbe separated from a solution--viz., according to their behaviour to\r\nhydric and ammoniac sulphides.\r\n\r\nThere are a few poisons, of course, such as the oxalates of the\r\nalkalies, which might be overlooked, unless sought for specially; but it\r\nis hoped that this is no valid objection to the arrangement suggested,\r\nwhich, in greater detail, is as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\nA.--POISONOUS GASES.\r\n\r\n  1. Carbon monoxide.\r\n  2. Chlorine.\r\n  3. Hydric sulphide.\r\n\r\n\r\nB.--ACIDS AND ALKALIES.\r\n\r\n  1. Sulphuric acid.\r\n  2. Hydrochloric acid.\r\n  3. Nitric acid.\r\n  4. Potash.\r\n  5. Soda.\r\n  6. Ammonia.\r\n  7. Neutral sodium, potassium, and ammonium salts.\r\n\r\nIn nearly all cases of death from any of the above, the analyst, from\r\nthe symptoms observed during life, from the surrounding circumstances,\r\nand from the pathological appearances and evident chemical reactions of\r\nthe fluids submitted, is put at once on the right track, and has no\r\ndifficulty in obtaining decided results.\r\n\r\n\r\nC.--POISONOUS SUBSTANCES CAPABLE OF BEING SEPARATED BY DISTILLATION FROM\r\nEITHER NEUTRAL OR ACID LIQUIDS.\r\n\r\n  1. Hydrocarbons.\r\n  2. Camphor.\r\n  3. Alcohols.\r\n  4. Amyl-nitrite.\r\n  5. Chloroform and other anæsthetics.\r\n  6. Carbon disulphide.\r\n  7. Carbolic acid.\r\n  8. Nitro-benzene.\r\n  9. Prussic acid.\r\n  10. Phosphorus.\r\n\r\nThe volatile alkaloids, which may also be readily distilled by strongly\r\nalkalising the fluid, because they admit of a rather different mode of\r\ntreatment, are not included in this class.\r\n\r\n\r\nD.--ALKALOIDS AND POISONOUS VEGETABLE PRINCIPLES SEPARATED FOR THE MOST\r\nPART BY ALCOHOLIC SOLVENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIVISION I.--VEGETABLE ALKALOIDS.\r\n\r\n   1. Liquid volatile alkaloids, alkaloids of hemlock, nicotine,\r\n      piturie, sparteine, aniline.\r\n   2. The opium group of alkaloids.\r\n   3. The strychnine or tetanic group of alkaloids--strychnine, brucine,\r\n      igasurine.\r\n   4. The aconite group of alkaloids.\r\n   5. The mydriatic group of alkaloids--atropine, hyoscyamine, solanin,\r\n      cytisine.\r\n   6. The alkaloids of the veratrines.\r\n   7. Physostigmine.\r\n   8. Pilocarpine.\r\n   9. Taxine.\r\n  10. Curarine.\r\n  11. Colchicin.\r\n  12. Muscarine and the active principles of certain fungi.\r\n\r\nThere would, perhaps, have been an advantage in arranging several of the\r\nindividual members somewhat differently--_e.g._, a group might be made\r\nof poisons which, like pilocarpine and muscarine, are antagonistic to\r\natropine; and another group suggests itself, the physiological action of\r\nwhich is the opposite of the strychnos class; solanin (although classed\r\nas a mydriatic, and put near to atropine) has much of the nature of a\r\nglucoside, and the same may be said of colchicin; so that, if the\r\nclassification were made solely on chemical grounds, solanin would have\r\nfollowed colchicin, and thus have marked the transition from the\r\nalkaloids to the glucosides.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIVISION II.--GLUCOSIDES.\r\n\r\n  1. The digitalis group.\r\n  2. Other poisonous glucosides acting on the heart.\r\n  3. Saponin.\r\n\r\nThe glucosides, when fairly pure, are easily recognised; they are\r\ndestitute of nitrogen, neutral in reaction, and split up into sugar and\r\nother compounds when submitted to the action of saponifying agents, such\r\nas boiling with dilute mineral acids.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIVISION III.--CERTAIN POISONOUS ANHYDRIDES OF THE ORGANIC ACIDS.\r\n\r\n  1. Santonin.\r\n  2. Mezereon.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that this class will in a few years be extended, for\r\nseveral other organic anitrogenous poisons exist, which, when better\r\nknown, will most likely prove to be anhydrides.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIVISION IV.--VARIOUS VEGETABLE POISONOUS PRINCIPLES NOT ADMITTING OF\r\nCLASSIFICATION UNDER THE PREVIOUS THREE DIVISIONS.\r\n\r\nErgot, picrotoxin, the poison of _Illicium religiosum_, cicutoxin,\r\n_Æthusa cynapium_, _Œnanthe crocata_, croton oil, savin oil, the\r\ntoxalbumins of castor oil and _Abrus_.\r\n\r\nThe above division groups together various miscellaneous toxic\r\nprinciples, none of which can at present be satisfactorily classified.\r\n\r\n\r\nE.--POISONS DERIVED FROM LIVING OR DEAD ANIMAL SUBSTANCES.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIVISION I.--POISONS SECRETED BY THE LIVING.\r\n\r\n  1. Poisonous amphibia.\r\n  2. Poison of the scorpion.\r\n  3. Poisonous fish.\r\n  4. Poisonous insects--spiders, wasps, bees, beetles, &c.\r\n  5. Snake poison.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIVISION II.--POISONS FORMED IN DEAD ANIMAL MATTERS.\r\n\r\n  1. Ptomaines.\r\n  2. Poisoning by putrid or changed foods--sausage poisoning.\r\n\r\n\r\nF.--THE OXALIC ACID GROUP.\r\n\r\n\r\nG.--INORGANIC POISONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIVISION I.--PRECIPITATED FROM A HYDROCHLORIC ACID SOLUTION BY HYDRIC\r\nSULPHIDE--PRECIPITATE, YELLOW OR ORANGE.\r\n\r\n    Arsenic, antimony, cadmium.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIVISION II.--PRECIPITATED BY HYDRIC SULPHIDE IN HYDROCHLORIC ACID\r\nSOLUTION--BLACK.\r\n\r\n    Lead, copper, bismuth, silver, mercury.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIVISION III.--PRECIPITATED FROM A NEUTRAL SOLUTION BY HYDRIC SULPHIDE.\r\n\r\n    Zinc, nickel, cobalt.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIVISION IV.--PRECIPITATED BY AMMONIA SULPHIDE.\r\n\r\n    Iron, chromium, thallium, aluminium.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIVISION V.--ALKALINE EARTHS.\r\n\r\n    Barium.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--Statistics.\r\n\r\n§ 20. The number of deaths from poison (whether accidental, suicidal, or\r\nhomicidal), as compared with other forms of violent, as well as natural\r\ndeaths, possesses no small interest; and this is more especially true\r\nwhen the statistics are studied in a comparative manner, and town be\r\ncompared with town, country with country.\r\n\r\nThe greater the development of commercial industries (especially those\r\nnecessitating the use or manufacture of powerful chemical agencies), the\r\nmore likely are accidents from poisons to occur. It may also be stated,\r\nfurther, that the higher the mental development of a nation, the more\r\nlikely are its homicides to be caused by subtle poison--its suicides by\r\nthe euthanasia of chloral, morphine, or hemlock.\r\n\r\nOther influences causing local diversity in the kind and frequency of\r\npoisoning, are those of race, of religion, of age and sex, and the\r\nmental stress concomitant with sudden political and social changes.\r\n\r\nIn the ten years from 1883-1892, there appear to have died from poison,\r\nin England and Wales, 6616 persons, as shown in the following tables:--\r\n\r\nDEATHS FROM POISON IN ENGLAND AND WALES DURING THE TEN YEARS 1883-92.\r\n\r\n  +----------------------------+---------+---------+---------+---------+\r\n  |

Considerable advance has been made of late years in the study of\r\nthe connection which exists between the chemical structure of the\r\nmolecule of organic substances and physiological effect. The results\r\nobtained, though important, are as yet too fragmentary to justify any\r\ngreat generalisation; the problem is a complicated one, and as Lauder\r\nBrunton justly observes:--\r\n\r\n“The physiological action of a drug does not depend entirely on its\r\nchemical composition nor yet on its chemical structure, so far as that\r\ncan be indicated even by graphic formula, but upon conditions of\r\nsolubility, instability, and molecular relations, which we may hope to\r\ndiscover in the future, but with which we are as yet imperfectly\r\nacquainted.”[32]\r\n\r\n[32] _Introduction to Modern Therapeutics_, Lond., 1892. 136.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of hydroxyl, whether the substance belong to the simpler\r\nchain carbon series or to the aromatic carbon compounds, appears to\r\nusually endow the substance with more or less active and frequently\r\npoisonous properties, as, for example, in the alcohols, and as in\r\nhydroxylamine. It is also found that among the aromatic bodies the toxic\r\naction is likely to increase with the number of hydroxyls: thus phenol\r\nhas one hydroxyl, resorcin two, and phloroglucin three; and the toxic\r\npower is strictly in the same order, for, of the three, phenol is least\r\nand phloroglucin most poisonous.\r\n\r\nReplacing hydrogen by a halogen, especially by chlorine, in the fatty\r\nacids mostly produces substances of narcotic properties, as, for\r\ninstance, monochloracetic acid. In the sulphur compounds, the entrance\r\nof chlorine modifies the physiological action and intensifies toxicity:\r\nthus ethyl sulphide (C₂H₅)₂S is a weak poison, monochlorethyl sulphide\r\nC₂H₅C₂H₄ClS a strong poison, and dichlorethyl sulphide C₄H₈Cl₂S a very\r\nstrong poison: the vapour kills rabbits within a short time, and a trace\r\nof the oil applied to the ear produces intense inflammation of both the\r\neyes and the ear.[33]\r\n\r\n[33] V. Meyer, _Ber. d. Chem. Ges._, XX., 1725.\r\n\r\nThe weight of the molecule has an influence in the alcohols and acids of\r\nthe fatty series; for instance, ethyl, propyl, butyl, and amyl alcohols\r\nshow as they increase in carbon a regular increase in toxic power; the\r\nnarcotic actions of sodium propionate, butyrate, and valerianate also\r\nincrease with the rising carbon. Nitrogen in the triad condition in the\r\namines is far less poisonous than in the pentad condition.\r\n\r\nBamberger[34] distinguishes two classes of hydrogenised bases derived\r\nfrom α and β naphthylamine, by the terms “acylic” and “aromatic.” The\r\nacylic contains the four added hydrogens in the amidogen nucleus, the\r\naromatic in the other nucleus, thus\r\n\r\n[34] _Ber._, xxii. 777-778.\r\n\r\n      CH    CNH₂\r\n      /\\   /\\\r\n     /  \\C/  \\\r\n  CH |   |   | CH\r\n     |   |   |\r\n  CH |   |   | CH\r\n     \\  /C\\  /\r\n      \\/   \\/\r\n      CH    CH\r\n\r\n  α Naphthylamine.\r\n\r\n      CH    CH\r\n      /\\   /\\\r\n     /  \\C/  \\\r\n  CH |   |   | CNH₂\r\n     |   |   |\r\n  CH |   |   | CH\r\n     \\  /C\\  /\r\n      \\/   \\/\r\n      CH    CH\r\n\r\n  β Naphthylamine.\r\n\r\n      CH    CH₂\r\n      /\\   /\\\r\n     /  \\C/  \\\r\n  CH |   |   | CNH₃\r\n     |   |   |\r\n  CH |   |   | CH₂\r\n     \\  /C\\  /\r\n      \\/   \\/\r\n      CH    CH₂\r\n\r\n  Acylic tetrahydro-α Naphthylamine.\r\n\r\n       CH₂   CH\r\n       /\\   /\\\r\n      /  \\C/  \\\r\n  CH₂ |   |   | CNH₂\r\n      |   |   |\r\n  CH₂ |   |   | CH\r\n      \\  /C\\  /\r\n       \\/   \\/\r\n       CH₂   CH\r\n\r\n  Aromatic tetrahydro-β Naphthylamine.\r\n\r\nThe acylic β tetrahydro-naphthylamine, the β\r\ntetrahydroethylnaphthylamine, and the β tetrahydromethylnaphthylamine\r\nall cause dilatation of the pupil and produce symptoms of excitation of\r\nthe cervical sympathetic nerve; the other members of the group are\r\ninactive.\r\n\r\n§ 24. The result of replacing hydrogen by alkyls in aromatic bodies has\r\nbeen studied by Schmiedeberg and others; replacing the hydrogen of the\r\namidogen by ethyl or methyl, usually results in a body having a more or\r\nless pronounced narcotic action. The rule is that methyl is stronger\r\nthan ethyl, but it does not always hold good; ortho-amido-phenol is not\r\nin itself poisonous, but when two hydrogens of the amidogen group are\r\nreplaced by two methyls thus--\r\n\r\n   HO\r\n    /\\\r\n   /  \\\r\n  |    |NH₂\r\n  |    |\r\n  |    |\r\n   \\  /\r\n    \\/\r\n\r\n   HO\r\n    /\\\r\n   /  \\\r\n  |    |N(CH₃)₂\r\n  |    |\r\n  |    |\r\n   \\  /\r\n    \\/\r\n\r\nthe resulting body has a weak narcotic action.\r\n\r\nIt would naturally be inferred that the replacement of the H in the\r\nhydroxyl by a third methyl would increase this narcotic action, but this\r\nis not so: on the other hand, if there are three ethyl groups in the\r\nsame situation a decidedly narcotic body is produced.\r\n\r\nThe influence of position of an alkyl in the aromatic bodies is well\r\nshown in ortho-, para- and meta-derivatives. Thus the author proved some\r\nyears ago that with regard to disinfecting properties, ortho-cresol was\r\nmore powerful than meta-; meta-cresol more powerful than para-; so again\r\northo-aceto-toluid is poisonous, causing acute nephritis;\r\nmeta-aceto-toluid has but feeble toxic actions but is useful as an\r\nantipyretic; and para-aceto-toluid is inactive.\r\n\r\nIn the trioxybenzenes, in which there are three hydroxyls, the toxic\r\naction is greater when the hydroxyls are consecutive, as in pyrogallol,\r\nthan when they are symmetrical, as in phloroglucin.\r\n\r\n    OH\r\n    /\\\r\n   /  \\\r\n  |    |OH\r\n  |    |\r\n  |    |OH\r\n   \\  /\r\n    \\/\r\n\r\n  Pyrogallol.\r\n\r\n      OH\r\n      /\\\r\n     /  \\\r\n    |    |\r\n    |    |\r\n  HO|    |OH\r\n     \\  /\r\n      \\/\r\n\r\n  Phloroglucin.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of methyl into the complicated molecule of an alkaloid\r\noften gives curious results: thus methyl strychnine and methyl brucine\r\ninstead of producing tetanus have an action on voluntary muscle like\r\ncurare.\r\n\r\nBenzoyl-ecgonine has no local anæsthetic action, but the introduction of\r\nmethyl into the molecule endows it with a power of deadening the\r\nsensation of the skin locally; on the other hand, cocethyl produces no\r\neffect of this kind.\r\n\r\nDrs. Crum Brown and Fraser[35] have suggested that there is some\r\nrelation between toxicity and the saturated or non-saturated condition\r\nof the molecule.\r\n\r\n[35] _Journ. Anat. and Phys._, vol. ii. 224.\r\n\r\nHinsberg and Treupel have studied the physiological effect of\r\nsubstituting various alkyls for the hydrogen of the hydroxyl group in\r\npara-acetamido-phenol.\r\n\r\nPara-aceto-amido-phenol when given to dogs in doses of 0.5 grm. for\r\nevery kilogr. of body weight causes slight narcotic symptoms, with\r\nslight paralysis; there is cyanosis and in the blood much methæmoglobin.\r\n\r\nIn men doses of half a gramme (7·7 grains) act as an antipyretic,\r\nrelieve neuralgia and have weak narcotic effects.\r\n\r\nThe following is the result of substituting certain alkyls for H in the\r\nHO group.\r\n\r\n(1) =Methyl.=--The narcotic action is strengthened and the antipyretic\r\naction unaffected. The methæmoglobin in the blood is somewhat less.\r\n\r\n(2) =Ethyl.=--Action very similar, but much less methæmoglobin is\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\n(3) =Propyl.=--Antipyretic action a little weaker. Methæmoglobin in the\r\nblood smaller than in para-acetamido-phenol, but more than when the\r\nmethyl or ethyl compound is administered.\r\n\r\n(4) =Amyl.=--Antipyretic action decreased.\r\n\r\nThe smallest amount of toxicity is in the ethyl substitution; while the\r\nmaximum antipyretic and antineuralgic action belongs to the methyl\r\nsubstitution.\r\n\r\nNext substitution was tried in the Imid group. It was found that\r\nsubstituting ethyl for H in the imid group annihilated the narcotic and\r\nantipyretic properties. No methæmoglobin could be recognised in the\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nLastly, simultaneous substitution of the H of the HO group by ethyl and\r\nthe substitution of an alkyl for the H in the NH group gave the\r\nfollowing results:--\r\n\r\n=Methyl.=--In dogs the narcotic action was strengthened, the\r\nmethæmoglobin in the blood diminished. In men the narcotic action was\r\nalso more marked as well as the anti-neural action. The stomach and\r\nkidneys were also stimulated.\r\n\r\n=Ethyl.=--In dogs the narcotic action was much strengthened, while the\r\nmethæmoglobin was diminished. In men the antipyretic and anti-neural\r\nactions were unaffected.\r\n\r\n=Propyl.=--In dogs the narcotic action was feebler than with methyl or\r\nethyl, and in men there was diminished antipyretic action.\r\n\r\n=Amyl.=--In dogs the narcotic action was much smaller.\r\n\r\nFrom this latter series the conclusion is drawn that the maximum of\r\nnarcotic action is obtained by the introduction of methyl and the\r\nmaximum antipyretic action by the introduction of methyl or ethyl. The\r\nethyl substitution is, as before, the less toxic.[36]\r\n\r\n[36] _Ueber die physiologische Wirkung des p-amido-phenol u. einiger\r\nDerivate desselben._ O. Hinsberg u. G. Treupel, _Archiv f. Exp. Pathol.\r\nu. Pharm._, B. 33, S. 216.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the entrance of an alkyl into the molecule of a substance\r\nis not constant; sometimes the action of the poison is weakened,\r\nsometimes strengthened. Thus, according to Stolnikow, dimethyl resorcin,\r\nC₆H₄(OCH₃)₂, is more poisonous than resorcin C₆H₄(OH)₂. Anisol C₆H₅OCH₃,\r\naccording to Loew, is more poisonous to algæ, bacteria, and infusoria\r\nthan phenol C₆H₅OH. On the other hand, the replacement by methyl of an\r\natom of hydrogen in the aromatic oxyacids weakens their action; methyl\r\nsalicylic acid\r\n\r\n       O.CH₃\r\n      /\r\n  C₆H₄\r\n      \\\r\n       COOH\r\n\r\nis weaker than salicylic acid\r\n\r\n       OH\r\n      /\r\n  C₆H₄      .\r\n      \\\r\n       COOH\r\n\r\nArsen-methyl chloride, As(CH₃)Cl₂, is strongly poisonous, but the\r\nintroduction of a second methyl As(CH₃)₂Cl makes a comparatively weak\r\npoison.\r\n\r\n§ 25. In some cases the increase of CO groups weakens the action of a\r\npoison; thus, in allantoin there are three carbonyl (CO) groups; this\r\nsubstance does not produce excitation of the spinal cord, but it\r\nheightens muscular irritability and causes, like xanthin, muscular\r\nrigidity; alloxantin, with a similar structure but containing six\r\ncarbonyl groups, does not possess this action.\r\n\r\n  NH--CH--NH\r\n   |  |   |\r\n  CO  |   CO\r\n   |  |   |\r\n  NH--CO  NH₂\r\n\r\n  Allantoin.\r\n\r\n  NH--CO  CO--HN\r\n   |  |   |   |\r\n   |  | O |   |\r\n   |  |/ \\|   |\r\n  CO--C---C   CO\r\n   |  |   |   |\r\n  NH--CO  CO--HN\r\n\r\n  Alloxantin.\r\n\r\n§ 26. A theory of general application has been put forward and supported\r\nwith great ability by Oscar Loew[37] which explains the action of\r\npoisons by presuming that living has a different composition to dead\r\nalbumin; the albumin of the chemist is a dead body of a definite\r\ncomposition and has a stable character; living albumin, such as\r\ncirculates in the blood or forms the protoplasm of the tissues, is not\r\n“stable” but “labile”; Loew says:--“If the old idea is accepted that\r\nliving albumin is chemically the same substance as that which is dead,\r\nnumerous toxic phenomena are inexplicable. It is impossible, for\r\ninstance, to explain how it is that diamide N₂H₄ and hydroxylamine NH₂OH\r\nare toxic, even with great dilution, on all living animals; whilst\r\nneither of those substances have the smallest action on dead plasma or\r\nthe ordinary dissolved passive albumin, there must therefore be present\r\nin the albumin of the living plasma a grouping of atoms in a “_labile_”\r\ncondition (_Atomgruppirungen labiler Art_) which are capable of entering\r\ninto reactions; such, according to our present knowledge, can only be\r\nthe aldehyde and the ketone groups. The first mentioned groups are more\r\nlabile and react in far greater dilution than the latter groups.”\r\n\r\n[37] _Ein natürliches System der Gift-Wirkungen_, München, 1893.\r\n\r\nLoew considers that all substances which enter into combination with\r\naldehyde or ketone groups must be poisonous to life generally. For\r\ninstance, hydroxylamine, diamide and its derivatives, phenylhydrazine,\r\nfree ammonia, phenol, prussic acid, hydric sulphide, sulphur dioxide and\r\nthe acid sulphites all enter into combination with aldehyde.\r\n\r\nSo again the formation of imide groups in the aromatic ring increases\r\nany poisonous properties the original substance possesses, because the\r\nimide group easily enters into combination with aldehyde; thus\r\npiperidine (CH₂)₅NH is more poisonous than pyridine (CH)₅N; coniine\r\nNH(CH₂)₄CH-CH₂-CH₂CH₃, is more poisonous than collidine\r\nN(CH)₄C-CH-(CH₃)₂; pyrrol (CH)₄NH than pyridine (CH)₅N; and amarin,[38]\r\n\r\n  C₆H₅-CH-NH\r\n       |  \\\r\n       |   CH-C₆H₅,\r\n       |  /\r\n  C₆H₅-C=N\r\n\r\nthan hydrobenzamide\r\n\r\n  C₆H₅-CH=N\r\n          \\\r\n           CH-C₆H₅.\r\n          /\r\n  C₆H₅-CH=N\r\n\r\n[38] Th. Weyl (_Lehrbuch der organischen Chemie_) states (p. 385) that\r\namarin is not poisonous, but Baccheti (_Jahr. d. Chemie_, 1855) has\r\nshown that 250 mgrms. of the acetate will kill a dog, 80 mgrms. a\r\nguinea-pig; and that it is poisonous to fishes, birds, and frogs:\r\nhydrobenzamide in the same doses has no effect.\r\n\r\nIf the theory is true, then substances with “labile” amido groups, on\r\nthe one hand, must increase in toxic activity if a second amido group is\r\nintroduced; and, on the other, their toxic qualities must be diminished\r\nif the amido group is changed into an imido group by the substitution of\r\nan atom of hydrogen for an alkyl.\r\n\r\nObservation has shown that both of these requirements are satisfied;\r\nphenylenediamine is more poisonous than aniline; toluylenediamine more\r\npoisonous than toluidine. Again, if an atom of hydrogen in the amido\r\n(NH₂) group in aniline be replaced by an alkyl, _e.g._ methyl or ethyl,\r\nthe resulting substance does not produce muscular spasm; but if the same\r\nalkyl is substituted for an atom of hydrogen in the benzene nucleus the\r\nconvulsive action remains unaffected.\r\n\r\nIf an acidyl, as for example the radical of acetic acid, enter into the\r\namido group, then the toxic action is notably weakened; thus,\r\nacetanilide is weaker than aniline, and acetylphenylhydrazine is weaker\r\nthan phenylhydrazine. If the hydrogen of the imido group be replaced by\r\nan alkyl or an acid radical, and therefore tertiary bound nitrogen\r\nrestored, the poisonous action is also weakened.\r\n\r\nIn xanthin there are three imido groups; the hydrogen of two of these\r\ngroups is replaced by methyl in theobromin; and in caffein the three\r\nhydrogens of the three imido groups are replaced by three methyls,\r\nthus:--\r\n\r\n  NH--CH\r\n  |   ║\r\n  CO  C--NH\r\n  |   |   \\\r\n  |   |    CO\r\n  |   |   /\r\n  NH--C==N\r\n\r\n  Xanthin.\r\n\r\n  N.CH₃--CH\r\n  |      ║\r\n  CO     C--N.CH₃\r\n  |      |   \\\r\n  |      |    CO\r\n  |      |   /\r\n  NH-----C==N\r\n\r\n  Theobromin.\r\n\r\n  N.CH₃--CH\r\n  |      ║\r\n  CO     C--N.CH₃\r\n  |      |   \\\r\n  |      |    CO\r\n  |      |   /\r\n  N.CH₃--C==N\r\n\r\n  Caffein.\r\n\r\nand experiment has shown that theobromin is weaker than xanthin, and\r\ncaffein still weaker than theobromin.\r\n\r\nLoew[39] makes the following generalisations:--\r\n\r\n[39] _Ein natürliches System der Gift-Wirkungen_, München, 1893.\r\n\r\n1. Entrance of the carboxyl or sulpho groups weakens toxic action.\r\n\r\n2. Entrance of a chlorine atom exalts the toxic character of the\r\ncatalytic poisons (Loew’s catalytic poisons are alcohols, ether,\r\nchloroform, chloral, carbon tetrachloride, methylal, carbon disulphide\r\nand volatile hydrocarbons).\r\n\r\n3. Entrance of hydroxyl groups in the catalytic poisons of the fatty\r\nseries weakens toxic character; on the other hand, it exalts the\r\ntoxicity of the substituting poisons. (Examples of Loew’s class of\r\n“substituting” poisons are hydroxylamine, phenylhydrazine, hydric\r\ncyanide, hydric sulphide, aldehyde, and the phenols.)\r\n\r\n4. A substance increases in poisonous character through every influence\r\nwhich increases its power of reaction with aldehyde or amido groups. If,\r\nfor example, an amido or imido group in the poison molecule be made more\r\n“labile,” or if thrice linked nitrogen is converted into nitrogen\r\nconnected by two bands, whether through addition of water or\r\ntransposition (_umlagerung_) or if a second amido group enters, the\r\npoisonous quality is increased. Presence of a negative group may modify\r\nthe action.\r\n\r\n5. Entrance of a nitro group strengthens the poisonous character. If a\r\ncarboxyl or a sulpho group is present in the molecule, or if, in passing\r\nthrough the animal body, negative groups combine with the poison\r\nmolecule, or carboxyl groups are formed in the said molecule; in such\r\ncases the poisonous character of the nitro group may not be apparent.\r\n\r\n6. Substances with double carbon linkings are more poisonous than the\r\ncorresponding saturated substances. Thus neurine with the double linking\r\nof the carbon of CH₂ is more poisonous than choline; vinylamine than\r\nethylamine.\r\n\r\n          CH==CH₂\r\n         /\r\n  (CH₃)₃N\r\n         \\\r\n          OH\r\n\r\n  Neurine.\r\n\r\n          CH₂--CH₂OH\r\n         /\r\n  (CH₃)₃N\r\n         \\\r\n          OH\r\n\r\n  Choline.\r\n\r\n  CH₂\r\n  ║\r\n  CH.NH₂\r\n\r\n  Vinylamine.\r\n\r\n  CH₃\r\n  |\r\n  CH₂.NH₂\r\n\r\n  Ethylamine.\r\n\r\n§ 27.

A philosophical investigation of poisons demands a complete\r\nmethodical examination into their action on every life form, from the\r\nlowest to the highest. Our knowledge is more definite with regard to the\r\naction of poisons on man, dogs, cats, rabbits, and frogs than on any\r\nother species. It may be convenient here to make a few general remarks\r\nas to the action of poisons on infusoria, the cephalopoda, and insects.\r\n\r\n=Infusoria.=--The infusoria are extremely sensitive to the poisonous\r\nalkaloids and other chemical agents. Strong doses of the alkaloids cause\r\na contraction of the cell contents, and somewhat rapid disintegration of\r\nthe whole body; moderate doses at first quicken the movements, then the\r\nbody gets perceptibly larger, and finally, as in the first case, there\r\nis disintegration of the animal substance.\r\n\r\nRossbach[41] gives the following intimations of the proportion of the\r\ntoxic principle necessary to cause death:--Strychnine 1 part dissolved\r\nin 1500 of water; veratrine 1 in 8000; quinine 1 in 5000; atropine 1 in\r\n1000; the mineral acids 1 in 400-600; salts 1 in 200-300.\r\n\r\n[41] N. J. Rossbach, _Pharm. Zeitschr. für Russland_, xix. 628.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary sensitiveness of the infusoria, and the small amount\r\nof material used in such experiments, would be practically useful if\r\nthere were any decided difference in the symptoms produced by different\r\npoisons. But no one could be at all certain of even the class to which\r\nthe poison belongs were he to watch, without a previous knowledge of\r\nwhat had been added to the water, the motions of poisoned infusoria.\r\nHence the fact is more curious than useful.\r\n\r\n=Cephalopoda.=--The action of a few poisons on the cephalopoda has been\r\ninvestigated by M. E. Yung.[42] Curara placed on the skin had no effect,\r\nbut on the branchiæ led to general paralysis. If given in even fifteen\r\ntimes a greater dose than necessary to kill a rabbit, it was not always\r\nfatal. Strychnine, dissolved in sea-water, in the proportion of 1 to\r\n30,000, causes most marked symptoms. The first sign is relaxation of the\r\nchromataphore muscle and the closing of the chromataphores; the animal\r\npales, the respiratory movements become more powerful, and at the end of\r\na notable augmentation in their number, they fall rapidly from the\r\nnormal number of 25 to 5 a minute. Then tetanus commences after a time,\r\nvarying with the dose of the poison; the arm stiffens and extends in\r\nfan-like form, the entire body is convulsed, the respiration is in\r\njerks, the animal empties his pouch, and at the end of a few minutes is\r\ndead, in a state of great muscular rigidity. If at this moment it is\r\nopened, the venous heart is found still beating. Nicotine and other\r\npoisons were experimented with, and the cephalopoda were found to be\r\ngenerally sensitive to the active alkaloids, and to exhibit more or less\r\nmarked symptoms.\r\n\r\n[42] _Compt. Rend._, t. xci. p. 306.\r\n\r\n=Insects.=--The author devoted considerable time, in the autumn of 1882,\r\nto observations on the effect of certain alkaloids on the common\r\nblow-fly, thinking it possible that the insect would exhibit a\r\nsufficient series of symptoms of physiological phenomena to enable it to\r\nbe used by the toxicologist as a living reagent. If so, the cheapness\r\nand ubiquity of the tiny life during a considerable portion of the year\r\nwould recommend it for the purpose. Provided two blow-flies are caught\r\nand placed beneath glass shades--the one poisoned, the other not--it is\r\nsurprising what a variety of symptoms can, with a little practice, be\r\ndistinguished. Nevertheless, the absence of pupils, and the want of\r\nrespiratory and cardiac movements, are, in an experimental point of\r\nview, defects for which no amount or variety of merely muscular symptoms\r\ncan compensate.\r\n\r\nFrom the nature of the case, we can only distinguish in the poisoned fly\r\ndulness or vivacity of movement, loss of power in walking on smooth\r\nsurfaces, irritation of the integument, disorderly movements of the\r\nlimbs, protrusion of the fleshy proboscis, and paralysis, whether of\r\nlegs or wings. My experiments were chiefly made by smearing the extracts\r\nor neutral solutions of poisons on the head of the fly. In this way some\r\nof it is invariably taken into the system, partly by direct absorption,\r\nand partly by the insect’s efforts to free itself from the foreign\r\nsubstance, in which it uses its legs and proboscis. For the symptoms\r\nwitnessed after the application of saponin, digitalin, and aconitine,\r\nthe reader is referred to the articles on those substances.\r\n\r\nIn poisoning by sausages, bad meat, curarine, and in obscure cases\r\ngenerally, in the present state of science, experiments on living\r\nanimals are absolutely necessary. In this, and in this way only, in very\r\nmany instances, can the expert prove the presence of zymotic, or show\r\nthe absence of chemical poison.\r\n\r\nThe Vivisection Act, however, effectually precludes the use of\r\nlife-tests in England save in licensed institutions. Hence the “methods”\r\nof applying life-tests described in former editions will be omitted.\r\n\r\n    § 29. =Effect of poisons on the heart of Cold-blooded Animals.=--The\r\n    Vivisection Act does not, however, interfere with the use of certain\r\n    living tests, such, for instance, as the testing of the action of\r\n    poisons upon the recently extirpated hearts of cold-blooded animals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Williams’ Apparatus.]\r\n\r\n    The heart of the frog, of the turtle, of the tortoise, and of the\r\n    shark will beat regularly for a long time after removal from the\r\n    body, if supplied with a regular stream of nutrient fluid. The\r\n    fluids used for this purpose are the blood of the herbivora diluted\r\n    with common salt solution, or a serum albumin solution, or a 2 per\r\n    cent. solution of gum arabic in which red blood corpuscles are\r\n    suspended. The simplest apparatus to use is that known as\r\n    “Williams’.” Williams’ apparatus consists of two glass bulbs (see\r\n    diagram), the one, P, containing nutrient fluid to which a known\r\n    quantity of the poison has been added; the other, N, containing the\r\n    same fluid but to which no poison has been added; these bulbs are\r\n    connected by caoutchouc tubing to a three-way tube, T, and each\r\n    piece of caoutchouc tubing has a pressure screw clip, V¹ and V; the\r\n    three-way tube is connected with a wider tube containing a valve\r\n    float, F, which gives free passage of fluid in one direction only,\r\n    that is, in the direction of the arrow; this last wide tube is\r\n    connected with a Y piece of tubing, which again is connected with\r\n    the aorta of the heart under examination, the other leg of the Y\r\n    tube is connected with another wide tube, X, having a float valve,\r\n    F²: the float containing a drop of mercury and permitting (like the\r\n    float valve F) passage in one direction only of fluid, it is obvious\r\n    that if the clip communicating with N is opened and the clip\r\n    communicating with P is closed, the normal fluid will circulate\r\n    alone through the heart; if, on the other hand, the P clip is open\r\n    and the N clip closed, the poisoned blood will alone feed the heart.\r\n    It is also clear that by raising or depressing the bulbs, the\r\n    circulating fluid can be delivered at any pressure, high or low.\r\n    Should a bubble of air get into the tubes, it can be got rid of by\r\n    removing the cork at S and bringing the fluid up to the level of the\r\n    top of the aperture. The observation is made by first ascertaining\r\n    the number and character of the beats when the normal fluid is\r\n    circulating, and then afterwards when the normal is replaced by the\r\n    poisoned fluid. A simpler but less accurate process is to pith two\r\n    frogs, excise their respective hearts, and place the hearts in\r\n    watch-glasses containing either serum or a solution of common salt\r\n    (strength 0·75 per cent.); to the one heart is now added a solution\r\n    of the poison under examination, and the difference in the behaviour\r\n    and character of the beats noted.\r\n\r\n    The phenomena to be specially looked for are the following:--\r\n\r\n  1. The heart at the height of the poisoning is arrested in diastole.\r\n  2. The heart at the height of the poisoning is arrested in systole.\r\n\r\n    =Arrest in diastole.=--The arrest may be preceded by the\r\n    contractions becoming weaker and weaker, or after the so-called\r\n    heart peristalsis; or it may be preceded by a condition in which the\r\n    auricle shows a different frequency to the ventricle.\r\n\r\n    The final diastole may be the diastole of paralysis or the diastole\r\n    of irritation.\r\n\r\n    The diastole of irritation is produced by a stimulus of the\r\n    inhibitory ganglia, and only occurs after poisoning by the muscarine\r\n    group of poisons. This condition may be recognised by the fact that\r\n    contraction may be excited by mechanical and electrical stimuli or\r\n    by the application of atropine solution; the latter paralyses the\r\n    inhibitory nervous centres, and therefore sets the mechanism going\r\n    again. The diastole of paralysis is the most frequent form of death.\r\n    It may readily be distinguished from the muscarine diastole; for, in\r\n    muscarine diastole, the heart is full of blood and larger than\r\n    normal; but in the paralytic form the heart is not fully extended,\r\n    besides which, although, if normal blood replace that which is\r\n    poisoned, the beats may be restored for a short time, the response\r\n    is incomplete, and the end is the same; besides which, atropine does\r\n    not restore the beats. The diastole of paralysis may depend on\r\n    paralysis of the so-called excito-motor ganglia (as with iodal), or\r\n    from paralysis of the muscular structure (as with copper).\r\n\r\n    § 30. =The effect of poisons on the iris.=--Several poisons affect\r\n    the pupil, causing either contraction or dilatation. The most\r\n    suitable animal is the cat; the pupil of the cat readily showing\r\n    either state.\r\n\r\n    =Toxic myosis, or toxic contraction of the pupil.=--There are two\r\n    forms of toxic myosis, one of which is central in its origin. In\r\n    this form, should the poison be applied to the eye itself, no marked\r\n    contraction follows; the poison must be swallowed or injected\r\n    subcutaneously to produce an effect. The contraction remains until\r\n    death.\r\n\r\n    The contraction in such a case is considered to be due to a\r\n    paralysis of the dilatation centre; it is a “_myosis paralytica\r\n    centralis_;” the best example of this is the contraction of the\r\n    pupil caused by morphine.\r\n\r\n    In the second case the poison, whether applied direct to the eye or\r\n    entering the circulation by subcutaneous injection, contracts the\r\n    pupil; the contraction persists if the eye is extirpated, but in all\r\n    cases the contraction may be changed into dilatation by the use of\r\n    atropine. An example of this kind of myosis is the action of\r\n    muscarine. It is dependent on the stimulation of the ends of the\r\n    nerves which contract the pupil, especially the ends of the _nervus\r\n    oculomotorius_ supplying the sphincter iridis; this form of myosis\r\n    is called _myosis spastica periphera_. A variety of this form is the\r\n    _myosis spastica muscularis_, depending on stimulation of the musc.\r\n    sphincter iridis, seen in poisoning by physostigmine. This causes\r\n    strong contraction of the pupil when locally applied; the\r\n    contraction is not influenced by small local applications of\r\n    atropine, but it may be changed to dilatation by high doses.\r\n    Subcutaneous injection of small doses of physostigmine does not\r\n    alter the pupil, but large poisonous doses contracts the pupil in a\r\n    marked manner.\r\n\r\n    =Toxic mydriasis, or toxic dilatation of the pupil.=--The following\r\n    varieties are to be noticed:--\r\n\r\n    1. Toxic doses taken by the mouth or given by subcutaneous injection\r\n    give rise to strong dilatation; this vanishes before death, giving\r\n    place to moderate contraction. This form is due to stimulation of\r\n    the dilatation centre, later passing into paralysis. An example is\r\n    found in the action of aconite.\r\n\r\n    2. After subcutaneous or local application, a dilatation neutralised\r\n    by physostigmine in moderate doses. This is characteristic of\r\n    β-tetrahydronaphthylamine.\r\n\r\n    3. After subcutaneous injection, or if applied locally in very small\r\n    doses, dilatation occurs persisting to death. Large doses of\r\n    physostigmine neutralise the dilatation, but it is not influenced by\r\n    muscarine or pilocarpine: this form is characteristic of atropine,\r\n    and it has been called _mydriasis paralytica periphera_.\r\n\r\n    The heart at the height of the poisoning stops in systole.\r\n\r\n    =2. Arrest in systole.=--The systole preceding the arrest is far\r\n    stronger than normal, the ventricle often contracting up into a\r\n    little lump. Contraction of this kind is specially to be seen in\r\n    poisoning by digitalis. In poisoning by digitalis the ventricle is\r\n    arrested before the auricle; in muscarine poisoning the auricle\r\n    stops before the ventricle. If the reservoir of Williams’ apparatus\r\n    is raised so as to increase the pressure within the ventricle the\r\n    beat may be restored for a time, to again cease.\r\n\r\n    A frog’s heart under the influence of any poison may be finally\r\n    divided into pieces so as to ascertain if any parts still contract;\r\n    the significance of this is, that the particular ganglion supplying\r\n    that portion of the heart has not been affected: the chief ganglia\r\n    to be looked for are Remak’s, on the boundary of the sinus and\r\n    auricle; Ludwig’s, on the auricle and the septum of the auricle;\r\n    Bidder’s, on the atrioventricular border, especially in the valves;\r\n    and Dogiel’s ganglion, between the muscular fibres. According to\r\n    Dogiel, poisons acting like muscarine affect every portion of the\r\n    heart, and atropine restores the contractile power of every portion.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.--General Method of Procedure in Searching for Poison.\r\n\r\n§ 31. Mineral substances, or liquids containing only inorganic matters,\r\ncan cause no possible difficulty to any one who is practised in\r\nanalytical investigation; but the substances which exercise the skill of\r\nthe expert are organic fluids or solids.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to be done is to note accurately the manner in which the\r\nsamples have been packed, whether the seals have been tampered with,\r\nwhether the vessels or wrappers themselves are likely to have\r\ncontaminated the articles sent; and then to make a very careful\r\nobservation of the appearance, smell, colour, and reaction of the\r\nmatters, not forgetting to take the weight, if solid--the volume, if\r\nliquid. All these are obvious precautions, requiring no particular\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nIf the object of research is the stomach and its contents, the contents\r\nshould be carefully transferred to a tall conical glass; the organ cut\r\nopen, spread out on a sheet of glass, and examined minutely by a lens,\r\npicking out any suspicious-looking substance for closer observation.\r\nThe mucous membrane should now be well cleansed by the aid of a\r\nwash-bottle, and if there is any necessity for destroying the stomach,\r\nit may be essential in important cases to have it photographed. The\r\nwashings having been added to the contents of the stomach, the sediment\r\nis separated and submitted to inspection, for it must be remembered\r\nthat, irrespective of the discovery of poison, a knowledge of the nature\r\nof the food last eaten by the deceased may be of extreme value.\r\n\r\nIf the death has really taken place from disease, and not from poison,\r\nor if it has been caused by poison, and yet no definite hint of the\r\nparticular poison can be obtained either by the symptoms or by the\r\nattendant circumstances, the analyst has the difficult task of\r\nendeavouring to initiate a process of analysis which will be likely to\r\ndiscover any poison in the animal, vegetable, or mineral kingdom. For\r\nthis purpose I have devised the following process, which differs from\r\nthose that have hitherto been published mainly in the prominence given\r\nto operations in a high vacuum, and the utilisation of biological\r\nexperiment as a matter of routine. Taking one of the most difficult\r\ncases that can occur--viz., one in which a small quantity only of an\r\norganic solid or fluid is available--the best method of procedure is the\r\nfollowing:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA small portion is reserved and examined microscopically, and, if\r\nthought desirable, submitted to various “cultivation” experiments. The\r\ngreater portion is at once examined for volatile matters, and having\r\nbeen placed in a strong flask, and, if neutral or alkaline, feebly\r\nacidulated with tartaric acid, connected with a second or receiving\r\nflask by glass tubing and caoutchouc corks. The caoutchouc cork of the\r\nreceiving flask has a double perforation, so as to be able, by a second\r\nbit of angle tubing, to be connected with the mercury-pump described in\r\nthe author’s work on “Foods,” the figure of which is here repeated (see\r\nthe accompanying figure). With a good water-pump having a sufficient\r\nlength of fall-tube, a vacuum may be also obtained that for practical\r\npurposes is as efficient as one caused by mercury; if the fall-tube\r\ndelivers outside the laboratory over a drain, no offensive odour is\r\nexperienced when dealing with putrid, stinking liquids. A vacuum having\r\nbeen obtained, and the receiving-flask surrounded with ice, a distillate\r\nfor preliminary testing may be generally got without the action of any\r\nexternal heat; but if this is too slow, the flask containing the\r\nsubstances or liquid under examination may be gently heated by a\r\nwater-bath--water, volatile oils, a variety of volatile substances, such\r\nas prussic acid, hydrochloric acid, phosphorus, &c., if present, will\r\ndistil over. It will be well to free in this way the substance, as much\r\nas possible, from volatile matters and water. When no more will come\r\nover, the distillate may be carefully examined by redistillation and the\r\nvarious appropriate tests.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: This figure is from “Foods.” B is a bell-jar, which can\r\nbe adapted by a cork to a condenser; R is made of iron; the rim of the\r\nbell-jar is immersed in mercury, which the deep groove receives.]\r\n\r\nThe next step is to dry the sample thoroughly. This is best effected\r\nalso in a vacuum by the use of the same apparatus, only this time the\r\nreceiving-flask is to be half filled with strong sulphuric acid. By now\r\napplying very gentle heat to the first flask, and cooling the sulphuric\r\nacid receiver, even such substances as the liver in twenty-four hours\r\nmay be obtained dry enough to powder.\r\n\r\nHaving by these means obtained a nearly dry friable mass, it is reduced\r\nto a coarse powder, and extracted with petroleum ether; the extraction\r\nmay be effected either in a special apparatus (as, for example, in a\r\nlarge “Soxhlet”), or in a beaker placed in the “Ether recovery\r\napparatus” (see fig.), which is adapted to an upright condenser. The\r\npetroleum extract is evaporated and leaves the fatty matter, possibly\r\ncontaminated by traces of any alkaloid which the substance may have\r\ncontained; for, although most alkaloids are insoluble in petroleum\r\nether, yet they are taken up in small quantities by oils and fats, and\r\nare extracted with the fat by petroleum ether. It is hence necessary\r\nalways to examine the petroleum extract by shaking it up with water,\r\nslightly acidulated with sulphuric acid, which will extract from the fat\r\nany trace of alkaloid, and will permit the discovery of such alkaloids\r\nby the ordinary “group reagents.”\r\n\r\nThe substance now being freed for the most part from water and from fat,\r\nis digested in the cold with absolute alcohol for some hours; the\r\nalcohol is filtered off, and allowed to evaporate spontaneously, or, if\r\nspeed is an object, it may be distilled _in vacuo_. The treatment is\r\nnext with hot alcohol of 90 per cent., and, after filtering, the dry\r\nresidue is exhausted with ether. The ether and alcohol, having been\r\ndriven off, leave extracts which may be dissolved in water and tested,\r\nboth chemically and biologically, for alkaloids, glucosides, and organic\r\nacids. It must also be remembered that there are a few metallic\r\ncompounds (as, for example, corrosive sublimate) which are soluble in\r\nalcohol and ethereal solvents, and must not be overlooked.\r\n\r\nThe residue, after being thus acted upon successively by petroleum, by\r\nalcohol, and by ether, is both water-free and fat-free, and also devoid\r\nof all organic poisonous bases and principles, and it only remains to\r\ntreat it for metals. For this purpose, it is placed in a retort, and\r\ndistilled once or twice to dryness with a known quantity of strong, pure\r\nhydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\nIf arsenic, in the form of arsenious acid, were present, it would distil\r\nover as a trichloride, and be detected in the distillate; by raising the\r\nheat, the organic matter is carbonised, and most of it destroyed. The\r\ndistillate is saturated with hydric sulphide, and any precipitate\r\nseparated and examined. The residue in the retort will contain the fixed\r\nmetals, such as zinc, copper, lead, &c. It is treated with dilute\r\nhydrochloric acid, filtered, the filtrate saturated with SH₂ and any\r\nprecipitate collected. The filtrate is now treated with sufficient sodic\r\nacetate to replace the hydric chloride, again saturated with SH₂ and any\r\nprecipitate collected and tested for _zinc_, _nickel_, and _cobalt_. By\r\nthis treatment, viz.:--\r\n\r\n  1. Distillation in a vacuum at a low temperature,\r\n  2. Collecting the volatile products,\r\n  3. Dehydrating the organic substances,\r\n  4. Dissolving out from the dry mass fatty matters and alkaloids,\r\n     glucosides, &c., by ethereal and alcoholic solvents,\r\n  5. Destroying organic matter and searching for metals,\r\n\r\n--a very fair and complete analysis may be made from a small amount of\r\nmaterial. The process is, however, somewhat faulty in reference to\r\nphosphorus, and also to oxalic acid and the oxalates; these poisons, if\r\nsuspected, should be specially searched for in the manner to be more\r\nparticularly described in the sections treating of them. In most cases,\r\nthere is sufficient material to allow of division into three parts--one\r\nfor organic poisons generally, one for inorganic, and a third for\r\nreserve in case of accident. When such is the case, although, for\r\norganic principles, the process of vacuum distillation just described\r\nstill holds good, it will be very much the most convenient way not to\r\nuse that portion for metals, but to operate on the portion reserved for\r\nthe inorganic poisons as follows by destruction of the organic matter.\r\n\r\nThe destruction of organic matter through simple distillation by means\r\nof pure hydrochloric acid is at least equal to that by sulphuric acid,\r\nchlorate of potash, and the carbonisation methods. The object of the\r\nchemist not being to dissolve every fragment of cellular tissue, muscle,\r\nand tendon, but simply all mineral ingredients, the less organic matter\r\nwhich goes into solution the better. That hydrochloric acid would fail\r\nto dissolve sulphate of baryta and sulphate of lead, and that sulphide\r\nof arsenic is also almost insoluble in the acid, is no objection to the\r\nprocess recommended, for it is always open to the analyst to treat the\r\nresidue specially for these substances. The sulphides precipitated by\r\nhydric sulphide from an acid solution are--arsenic, antimony, tin,\r\ncadmium, lead, bismuth, mercury, copper, and silver. Those not\r\nprecipitated are--iron, manganese, zinc, nickel, and cobalt.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, one poison alone is present; so that if there should be a\r\nsulphide, it will belong only exceptionally to more than one metal.\r\n\r\nThe colour of the precipitate from hydric sulphide is either yellowish\r\nor black. The yellow and orange precipitates are sulphur, sulphides of\r\narsenic, antimony, tin, and cadmium. In pure solutions they may be\r\nalmost distinguished by their different hues, but in solutions\r\ncontaminated by a little organic matter the colours may not be\r\ndistinctive. The sulphide of arsenic is of a pale yellow colour; and if\r\nthe very improbable circumstance should happen that arsenic, antimony,\r\nand cadmium occur in the same solution, the sulphide of arsenic may be\r\nfirst separated by ammonia, and the sulphide of antimony by sulphide of\r\nsodium, leaving cadmic sulphide insoluble in both processes.\r\n\r\nThe black precipitates are--lead, bismuth, mercury, copper, and silver.\r\nThe black sulphide is freed from arsenic, if present, by ammonia, and\r\ndigested with dilute nitric acid, which will dissolve all the sulphides,\r\nsave those of mercury and tin, so that if a complete solution is\r\nobtained (sulphur flocks excepted), it is evident that both these\r\nsubstances are absent. The presence of copper is betrayed by the blue\r\ncolour of the nitric acid solution, and through its special reactions;\r\nlead, by the deep yellow precipitate which falls by the addition of\r\nchromate of potash and acetate of soda to the solution; bismuth, through\r\na white precipitate on dilution with water. If the nitric acid leaves a\r\nblack insoluble residue, this is probably sulphide of mercury, and\r\nshould be treated with concentrated hydrochloric acid to separate flocks\r\nof sulphur, evaporated to dryness, again dissolved, and tested for\r\nmercury by iodide of potassium, copper foil, &c., as described in the\r\narticle on _Mercury_. Zinc, nickel, and cobalt are likewise tested for\r\nin the filtrate as described in the respective articles on these metals.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTENRIETH’S GENERAL PROCESS.\r\n\r\n    § 32. A general method of procedure has been published by W.\r\n    Autenrieth.[43]\r\n\r\n[43] _Kurze Anleitung zur Auffindung der Gifte_, Freiburg, 1892.\r\n\r\n    He divides poisonous substances, for the purposes of separation and\r\n    detection, into three classes:--\r\n\r\n    I. Poisons capable of distillation from an acid aqueous solution.\r\n   II. Organic substances which are not capable of distillation from\r\n       acid solutions.\r\n  III. Metallic poisons.\r\n\r\n    Where possible, the fluid or solids submitted to the research are\r\n    divided into four equal parts, one of the parts to be kept in\r\n    reserve in case of accident or as a control; one of the remaining\r\n    three parts to be distilled; a second to be investigated for organic\r\n    substances; and a third for metals. After the extraction of organic\r\n    substances from part No. II. the residue may be added to No. III.\r\n    for the purpose of search after metals; and, if the total quantity\r\n    is small, the whole of the process may be conducted without\r\n    division.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. SUBSTANCES SEPARATED BY DISTILLATION.\r\n\r\n    The substances are placed in a capacious flask, diluted if necessary\r\n    with water to the consistence of a thin soup, and tartaric acid\r\n    added to distinct acid reaction, and distilled.\r\n\r\n    In this way phosphorus, prussic acid, carbolic acid, chloroform,\r\n    chloral hydrate, nitrobenzol, aniline,[44] and alcohol may be\r\n    separated and identified by the reactions given in the sections of\r\n    this work describing those substances.\r\n\r\n[44] Aniline is a weak base, so that, although a solution be acid, some\r\nof the aniline distils over on heating.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. ORGANIC POISONS NOT VOLATILE IN ACID SOLUTION.\r\n\r\n    Part No. II. is mixed with double its volume of absolute alcohol,\r\n    tartaric acid added to distinct acid reaction and placed in a flask\r\n    connected with an inverted Liebig’s condenser; it is then warmed for\r\n    15 to 20 minutes on the water-bath. After cooling, the mixture is\r\n    filtered, the residue well washed with alcohol and evaporated to a\r\n    thin syrup in a porcelain dish over the water-bath. The dish is then\r\n    allowed to cool and digested with 100 c.c. of water; fat and\r\n    resinous matters separate, the watery solution is filtered through\r\n    Swedish paper previously moistened: if the fluid filtrate is clear\r\n    it may be at once shaken up with ether, but if not clear, and\r\n    especially if it is more or less slimy, it is evaporated again on\r\n    the water-bath to the consistence of an extract: the extract treated\r\n    with 60 to 80 c.c. of absolute alcohol (which precipitates mucus and\r\n    dextrin-like substances), the alcohol evaporated off and the residue\r\n    taken up with from 60 to 80 c.c. of distilled water; it is then\r\n    shaken up with ether, as in Dragendorff’s process, and such\r\n    substances as digitalin, picric acid, salicylic acid, antipyrin and\r\n    others separated in this way and identified.\r\n\r\n    After this treatment with ether, and the separation of the ether\r\n    extract, the watery solution is strongly alkalised with caustic soda\r\n    and shaken up again with ether, which dissolves almost every\r\n    alkaloid save morphine and apomorphine; the ethereal extract is\r\n    separated and any alkaloid left identified by suitable tests.\r\n\r\n    The aqueous solution, now deprived of substances soluble in ether\r\n    both from acid and from solutions made alkaline by soda, is now\r\n    investigated for morphine and apomorphine; the apomorphine being\r\n    separated by first acidifying a portion of the alkaline solution\r\n    with hydrochloric acid, then alkalising with ammonia and shaking out\r\n    with ether. The morphine is separated from the same solution by\r\n    shaking out with warm chloroform.[45]\r\n\r\n[45] Hot amyl alcohol would be better (see “Morphine”).\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. METALS.\r\n\r\n    The substances are placed in a porcelain dish and diluted with a\r\n    sufficient quantity of water to form a thin soup and 20 to 30 c.c.\r\n    of pure hydrochloric acid added; the dish is placed on the\r\n    water-bath and 2 grms. of potassic chlorate added. The contents are\r\n    stirred from time to time, and successive quantities of potassic\r\n    chlorate are again added, until the contents are coloured yellow.\r\n    The heating is continued, with, if necessary, the addition of more\r\n    acid, until all smell of chlorine has ceased. If there is\r\n    considerable excess of acid, this is to be evaporated away by\r\n    diluting with a little water and continuing to heat on the\r\n    water-bath. The dish with its contents is cooled, a little water\r\n    added, and the fluid is then filtered.\r\n\r\n    The metals remaining on the filter are:--\r\n\r\n  Silver chloride,\r\n  Lead sulphate,\r\n  Barium sulphate;\r\n\r\n    in the filtrate will be all the other metals.\r\n\r\n    The filtrate is put in a flask and heated to from 60 to 80 degrees\r\n    and submitted to a slow stream of hydric sulphide gas; when the\r\n    fluid is saturated with the gas, the flask is securely corked and\r\n    allowed to rest for twelve hours; at the end of that time the fluid\r\n    is filtered and the filter washed with water saturated with hydric\r\n    sulphide.\r\n\r\n    The still moist sulphides remaining on the filter are treated with\r\n    yellow ammonium sulphide containing some free ammonia and washed\r\n    with sulphide of ammonium water. Now remaining on the filter, if\r\n    present at all, will be:--\r\n\r\n  Mercury sulphide,\r\n  Lead sulphide,\r\n  Copper sulphide,\r\n  Cadmium sulphide;\r\n\r\n    in the filtrate may be:--\r\n\r\n  Arsenic sulphide,\r\n  Antimony sulphide,\r\n  Tin sulphide,\r\n\r\n    and there may also be a small portion of copper sulphide, because\r\n    the latter is somewhat soluble in a considerable quantity of\r\n    ammonium sulphide.\r\n\r\n    The filtrate from the original hydric sulphide precipitate will\r\n    contain, if present, the sulphides of zinc and chromium in solution.\r\n\r\n\r\nINVESTIGATION OF THE SULPHIDES SOLUBLE IN AMMONIUM SULPHIDE, VIZ.,\r\nARSENIC, ANTIMONY, TIN.\r\n\r\n    The ammonium sulphide solution is evaporated to dryness in a\r\n    porcelain dish, strong nitric acid added and again dried. To this\r\n    residue a little strong caustic soda solution is added, and then it\r\n    is intimately mixed with three times its weight of a mixture\r\n    composed of 2 of potassic nitrate to 1 of dry sodium hydrate. This\r\n    is now cast, bit by bit, into a red-hot porcelain crucible. The\r\n    whole is heated until it has melted into a colourless fluid.\r\n\r\n    Presuming the original mass contained arsenic, antimony, and tin,\r\n    the melt contains sodic arseniate, sodic pyro-antimonate, sodic\r\n    stannate, and tin oxide; it may also contain a trace of copper\r\n    oxide.\r\n\r\n    The melt is cooled, dissolved in a little water, and sodium\r\n    bicarbonate added so as to change any caustic soda remaining into\r\n    carbonate, and to decompose the small amount of sodic stannate; the\r\n    liquid is then filtered.\r\n\r\n    The filtrate will contain the arsenic as sodic arseniate; while on\r\n    the filter there will be pyro-antimonate of soda, tin oxide, and,\r\n    possibly, a little copper oxide.\r\n\r\n    The recognition of these substances now is not difficult (see the\r\n    separate articles on _Antimony_, _Tin_, _Zinc_, _Arsenic_,\r\n    _Copper_).\r\n\r\n\r\nINVESTIGATION OF THE SULPHIDES INSOLUBLE IN SULPHIDE OF AMMONIUM, VIZ.,\r\nMERCURY, LEAD, COPPER, CADMIUM.\r\n\r\n    If the precipitate is contaminated with organic matter, it is\r\n    treated with hydrochloric acid and potassic chlorate in the manner\r\n    already described, p. 51.\r\n\r\n    Afterwards it is once more saturated with hydric sulphide, the\r\n    precipitate is collected on a filter, well washed, and the sulphides\r\n    treated with moderately concentrated nitric acid (1 vol. nitric\r\n    acid, 2 vols. water). The sulphides are best treated with this\r\n    solvent on the filter; all the sulphides mentioned, save mercury\r\n    sulphide, dissolve and pass into the filtrate. This mercury sulphide\r\n    may be dissolved by nitro-muriatic acid, the solution evaporated to\r\n    dryness, the residue dissolved in water acidified with hydrochloric\r\n    acid and tested for mercury (see “Mercury”).\r\n\r\n    The filtrate containing, it may be, nitrates of lead, copper and\r\n    cadmium is evaporated nearly to dryness and taken up in a very\r\n    little water. The lead is separated as sulphate by the addition of\r\n    dilute sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\n    The filtered solution, freed from lead, is treated with ammonia to\r\n    alkaline reaction; if copper be present, a blue colour is produced,\r\n    and this may be confirmed by other tests (see “Copper”). To detect\r\n    cadmium in the presence of copper, potassic cyanide is added to the\r\n    blue liquid until complete decolorisation, and the liquid treated\r\n    with SH₂; if cadmium be present, it is thrown down as a yellow\r\n    sulphide, while potassic cupro-cyanide remains in solution.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEARCH FOR ZINC AND CHROMIUM.\r\n\r\n    The filtrate from the hydric sulphide precipitate is divided into\r\n    two parts; the one half is used in the search for zinc, the other\r\n    half is used for chromium.\r\n\r\n    =Search for Zinc.=--The liquid is alkalised with ammonia and then\r\n    ammonium sulphide is added. There will always be a precipitate of a\r\n    dark colour; the precipitate will contain earthy phosphates, iron\r\n    and, in some cases, manganese. The liquid with the precipitate is\r\n    treated with acetic acid to strong acid reaction and allowed to\r\n    stand for several hours. The portion of the precipitate remaining\r\n    undissolved is collected on a filter, washed, dried and heated to\r\n    redness in a porcelain crucible. The residue thus heated is cooled\r\n    and dissolved in a little dilute sulphuric acid. To the acid\r\n    solution ammonia is added, and any precipitate formed is treated\r\n    with acetic acid; should the precipitate not completely dissolve,\r\n    phosphate of iron is present; this is filtered off, and if SH₂ be\r\n    added to the filtrate, white zinc sulphide will come down (see\r\n    “Zinc”).\r\n\r\n    =Search for Chromium.=--The second part of the SH₂ filtrate is\r\n    evaporated to a thin extract, mixed with double its weight of sodic\r\n    nitrate, dried and cast, little by little, into a red-hot porcelain\r\n    crucible. When the whole is fully melted, the crucible is removed\r\n    from the flame, cooled, and the mass dissolved in water and\r\n    filtered. Any chromium present will now be in solution in the easily\r\n    recognised form of potassic chromate (see “Chromium”).\r\n\r\n\r\nINVESTIGATION OF THE RESIDUE (p. 52) AFTER THE TREATMENT OF THE ORIGINAL\r\nSUBSTANCE WITH HYDROCHLORIC ACID AND POTASSIC CHLORATE FOR PRESENCE OF\r\nSILVER CHLORIDE, LEAD AND BARIUM SULPHATES.\r\n\r\n    The residue is dried and intimately mixed with three times its\r\n    weight of a mixture containing 2 parts of sodic nitrate and 1 part\r\n    of sodium hydrate, This is added, little by little, into a red-hot\r\n    porcelain crucible. The melted mass is cooled, dissolved in a little\r\n    water, a current of CO₂ passed through the solution to convert any\r\n    caustic soda into carbonate, and the solution boiled. The result\r\n    will be an insoluble portion consisting of carbonates of lead and\r\n    baryta, and of metallic silver. The mixture is filtered; the\r\n    insoluble residue on the filter is warmed for some time with dilute\r\n    nitric acid; the solution of nitrates of silver, lead and barium are\r\n    concentrated on the water-bath nearly to dryness so as to get rid of\r\n    any excess of acid, and the nitrates dissolved in water; then the\r\n    silver is precipitated by hydrochloric acid, the lead by SH₂, and\r\n    the barium by sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.--The Spectroscope as an aid to the Identification of certain\r\nPoisons.\r\n\r\n§ 33. The spectra of many of the metals, of phosphine, of arsine and of\r\nseveral other inorganic substances are characteristic and easily\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, from the employment of the _micro-spectroscope_ that the\r\ntoxicologist is likely to get most assistance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOscar Brasch[46] has within the last few years studied spectroscopy in\r\nrelation to the alkaloids and organic poisons. Some of these, when mixed\r\nwith Froehde’s reagent, or with sulphuric acid, or with sulphuric acid\r\nand potassic dichromate, or with nitric acid, give characteristic\r\ncolours, and the resulting solutions, when examined by a spectroscope,\r\nfor the most part show absorption bands; these bands may, occasionally,\r\nassist materially in the identification of a poison. By far the best\r\napparatus is a micro-spectroscope of the Sorby and Browning type, to\r\nwhich is added an apparatus for measuring the position on a scale of the\r\nlines and bands. Seibert and Kraft of Wetzlar make an excellent\r\ninstrument, in which a small bright triangle is projected on the\r\nspectrum; this can be moved by a screw, so that the apex may be brought\r\nexactly in the centre of any line or band, and its position read on an\r\noutside scale. The first thing to be done with such an instrument is to\r\ndetermine the position on the scale of the chief Fraunhofer lines or of\r\nthe more characteristic lines of the alkalies and alkaline earths,[47]\r\nthe wave lengths of which are accurately known. If, now, the scale\r\ndivisions are set out as abscissæ, and the wave lengths in millionths of\r\na millimetre are made the ordinates of a diagram, and an equable curve\r\nplotted out, as fully explained in the author’s work on “Foods,” it is\r\neasy to convert the numbers on the scale into wave lengths, and so make\r\nthe readings applicable to any spectroscope. For the purpose of\r\ngraphical illustration the curve method is convenient, and is adopted in\r\nthe preceding diagrams, all taken from Oscar Brasch’s monograph. Where\r\nthe curve is highest there the absorption band is thickest; where the\r\ncurve is lowest there the band is weak. The fluid to be examined is\r\nsimply placed in a watch-glass, the watch-glass resting on the\r\nmicroscope stand.\r\n\r\n[46] _Ueber Verwendbarkeit der Spectroscopie zur Unterscheidung der\r\nFarbenreactionen der Gifte im Interesse der forensischen Chemie_,\r\nDorpat, 1890.\r\n\r\n[47] The alkalies and earths used for this purpose, with their wave\r\nlengths, are as follows: KCl, a line in the red λ 770, in the violet λ\r\n404. Lithium chloride, red line, 670·5; sodium chloride, yellow, 589;\r\nstrontium chloride, line in the blue, 461. It is also useful to measure\r\nthe green line of thallium chloride = 535.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CURVES INDICATING THE POSITION OF ABSORPTION BANDS ON\r\nTREATING CERTAIN ALKALOIDS WITH REAGENTS.\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CURVES INDICATING ABSORPTION BANDS.\r\n\r\n   1.

Spots, supposed to be blood--whether on linen, walls, or\r\nweapons--should, in any important case, be photographed before any\r\nchemical or microscopical examination is undertaken. Blood-spots,\r\naccording to the nature of the material to which they are adherent, have\r\ncertain naked eye peculiarities--_e.g._, blood on fabrics, if dry, has\r\nat first a clear carmine-red colour, and part of it soaks into the\r\ntissue. If, however, the tissue has been worn some time, or was\r\noriginally soiled, either from perspiration, grease, or filth, the\r\ncolour may not be obvious or very distinguishable from other stains;\r\nnevertheless, the stains always impart a certain stiffness, as from\r\nstarch, to the tissue. If the blood has fallen on such substances as\r\nwood or metal, the spot is black, has a bright glistening surface, and,\r\nif observed by a lens, exhibits radiating fissures and a sort of\r\npattern, which, according to some, is peculiar to each species; so that\r\na skilled observer might identify occasionally, from the pattern alone,\r\nthe animal whence the blood was derived. The blood is dry and brittle,\r\nand can often be detached, or a splinter of it, as it were, obtained.\r\nThe edges of the splinter, if submitted to transmitted light, are\r\nobserved to be red. Blood upon iron is frequently very intimately\r\nadherent; this is specially the case if the stain is upon rusty iron,\r\nfor hæmatin forms a compound with iron oxide. Blood may also have to be\r\nrecovered from water in which soiled articles have been washed, or from\r\nwalls, or from the soil, &c. In such cases the spot is scraped off from\r\nwalls, plaster, or masonry, with as little of the foreign matters as may\r\nbe. It is also possible to obtain the colouring-matter of blood from its\r\nsolution in water, and present it for farther examination in a\r\nconcentrated form, by the use of certain precipitating agents (see p.\r\n61).\r\n\r\nIn the following scheme for the examination of blood-stains, it is\r\npresumed that only a few spots of blood, or, in any case, a small\r\nquantity, is at the analyst’s disposal.\r\n\r\n(1) The dried spot is submitted to the action of a cold saturated\r\nsolution of borax. This medium (recommended by Dragendorff)[48] does\r\ncertainly dissolve out of linen and cloth blood-colouring matter with\r\ngreat facility. The best way to steep the spots in the solution is to\r\nscrape the spot off the fabric, and to digest it in about a cubic\r\ncentimetre of the borax solution, which must not exceed 40°; the\r\ncoloured solution may be placed in a little glass cell, with parallel\r\nwalls, ·5 centimetre broad, and ·1 deep, and submitted to spectroscopic\r\nexamination, either by the ordinary spectroscope or by the\r\nmicro-spectroscope; if the latter is used, a very minute quantity can be\r\nexamined, even a single drop. In order to interpret the results of this\r\nexamination properly, it will be necessary to be intimately acquainted\r\nwith the spectroscopic appearances of both ancient and fresh blood.\r\n\r\n[48] _Untersuchungen von Blutspuren_ in Maschka’s _Handbuch_, Bd. i.\r\nHalfband 2.\r\n\r\n§ 35. =Spectroscopic Appearances of Blood.=--If defibrinated blood[49]\r\nbe diluted with water until it contains about ·01 per cent. of\r\noxyhæmoglobin, and be examined by a spectroscope, the layer of liquid\r\nbeing 1 centimetre thick, a single absorption band between the wave\r\nlengths 583 and 575 is observed, and, under favourable circumstances,\r\nthere is also to be seen a very weak band from 550 to 532. With\r\nsolutions so dilute as this, there is no absorption at either the violet\r\nor the red end of the spectrum. A solution containing ·09 per cent. of\r\noxyhæmoglobin shows very little absorption in the red end, but the\r\nviolet end is dark up to about the wave length 428. Two absorption bands\r\nmay now be distinctly seen. A solution containing ·37 per cent. of\r\noxyhæmoglobin shows absorption of the red end to about W.L. 720; the\r\nviolet is entirely, the blue partly, absorbed to about 453. The bands\r\nare considerably broader, but the centre of the bands occupies the same\r\nrelative position. A solution containing as much as ·8 per cent. of\r\noxyhæmoglobin is very dark; the two bands have amalgamated, the red end\r\nof the spectrum is absorbed nearly up to Fraunhofer’s line a; the green\r\nis just visible between W.L. 498 and 518. Venous blood, or arterial\r\nblood, which has been treated with reducing agents, such, for example,\r\nas an alkaline sulphide, gives the spectrum of reduced hæmoglobin. If\r\nthe solution is equivalent to about ·2 per cent., a single broad band,\r\nwith the edges very little defined, is seen to occupy the space between\r\nW.L. 595 and 538, the band being darkest about 550; both ends of the\r\nspectrum are more absorbed than by a solution of oxyhæmoglobin of the\r\nsame strength. In the blood of persons or animals poisoned with hydric\r\nsulphide--to the spectrum of reduced hæmoglobin, there is added a weak\r\nabsorption band in the red, with its centre nearly corresponding with\r\nthe Fraunhofer line C. Blood which has been exposed to carbon oxide has\r\na distinct spectrum, due, it would seem, to a special combination of\r\nthis gas with hæmoglobin; in other words, instead of oxygen, the oxygen\r\nof oxyhæmoglobin has been displaced by carbon oxide, and crystals of\r\ncarbon oxide-hæmoglobin, isomorphous with those of oxyhæmoglobin, may be\r\nobtained by suitable treatment. The spectrum of carbon oxide-hæmoglobin,\r\nhowever, differs so little from that of normal blood, that it is only\r\ncomparison with the ordinary spectrum, or careful measurements, which\r\nwill enable any person, not very familiar with the different spectra of\r\nblood, to detect it; with careful and painstaking observation the two\r\nspectra are seen to be distinct. The difference between the carbon oxide\r\nand the normal spectrum essentially consists in a slight moving of the\r\nbands nearer to E. According to the measurements of Gamgee, the band α\r\nof CO-hæmoglobin has its centre approximately at W.L. 572, and the band\r\nβ has for its centre W.L. from 534 to 538, according to concentration.\r\nIf a small quantity of an ammoniacal solution of ferrous tartrate or\r\ncitrate be added to blood containing carbon oxide, the bands do not\r\nwholly fade, but persist more or less distinctly; whereas, if the same\r\nsolution is added to bright red normal blood, the two bands vanish\r\ninstantly and coalesce to form the spectrum of reduced hæmoglobin. When\r\neither a solution of hæmoglobin or blood is exposed to the air for some\r\ntime, it loses its bright red colour, becomes brownish-red, and presents\r\nan acid reaction. On examining the spectrum, the two bands have become\r\nfaint, or quite extinct; but there is a new band, the centre of which\r\n(according to Gamgee) occupies W.L. 632, but (according to Preyer) 634.\r\nIn solutions of a certain strength, four bands may be seen, but in a\r\nstrong solution only one. This change in the spectrum is due to the\r\npassing of the hæmoglobin into _methæmoglobin_, which may be considered\r\nas an intermediate stage of decomposition, prior to the breaking up of\r\nthe hæmoglobin into hæmatin and proteids.\r\n\r\n[49] In this brief notice of the spectroscopic appearances of the blood,\r\nthe measurements in wave lengths are, for the most part, after\r\nGamgee.--_Text-Book of Physiological Chemistry_, London, 1880.\r\n\r\nA spectrum very similar to that of methæmoglobin is obtained by treating\r\nancient blood-stains with acetic acid--viz., the spectrum of _acid\r\nhæmatin_, but the band is nearer to its centre, according to Gamgee,\r\ncorresponding to W.L. 640 (according to Preyer, 656·6). The portion of\r\nthe band is a little different in alkaline solution, the centre being\r\nabout 592. Hæmatin is one of the bodies into which hæmoglobin splits up\r\nby the addition of such agents as strong acetic acid, or by the\r\ndecomposing influence of exposure; the view most generally accepted\r\nbeing that the colouring-matter of the blood is hæmatin in combination\r\nwith one or more albuminoid bodies. The hæmatin obtained by treating\r\nblood with acetic acid may be dissolved out by ether, and the ethereal\r\nsolution then exhibits a remarkable distinctive spectrum. Hence, in the\r\nspectroscopic examination of blood, or solutions of blood, for\r\nmedico-legal purposes, if the blood is fresh, the spectrum likely to be\r\nseen is either that of oxyhæmoglobin or hæmoglobin; but, if the\r\nblood-stain is not recent, then the spectrum of either hæmatin or\r\nmethæmoglobin.\r\n\r\nThe colouring-matter of cochineal, to which alum, potassic carbonate,\r\nand tartrate have been added, gives a spectrum very similar to that of\r\nblood (see “Foods,” p. 82); but this is only the case when the solution\r\nis fresh. The colour is at once discharged by chlorine, while the colour\r\nof blood, although changed in hue, remains. The colouring-matter of\r\ncertain red feathers, purpurin-sulphuric acid, and a few other reds,\r\nhave some similarity to either the hæmatin or the hæmoglobin spectrum,\r\nbut the bands do not strictly coincide; besides, no one would trust to a\r\nsingle test, and none of the colouring-matters other than blood yield\r\nhæmatin.\r\n\r\nThe blood in CO poisoning has also other characteristics. It is of a\r\npeculiar florid vermilion colour, a colour that is very persistent,\r\nlasting for days and even weeks.\r\n\r\nNormal blood mixed with 30 per cent. potash solution forms _greenish_\r\nstreaky clots, while blood charged with CO forms red streaky clots.\r\n\r\nNormal blood diluted to 50 times its volume of water, and then treated\r\nsuccessively with yellow ammonium sulphide in the proportion of 2 to 25\r\nc.c. of blood, followed by three drops of acetic acid, gives a grey\r\ncolour, while CO blood remains bright red. CO blood shaken with 4 times\r\nits volume of lead acetate remains red, but normal blood becomes\r\nbrown.[50]\r\n\r\n[50] M. Rubner, _Arch. Hyg._, x. 397.\r\n\r\nSolutions of platinum chloride or zinc chloride give a bright red colour\r\nwith CO blood; normal blood is coloured brown or very dark brown.\r\n\r\nPhospho-molybdic acid or 5 per cent. phenol gives a carmine-coloured\r\nprecipitate with CO blood, but a reddish-brown precipitate with normal\r\nblood (sensitive to 16 per cent.).\r\n\r\nA mixture of 2 c.c. of dilute acetic acid and 15 c.c. of 20 per cent.\r\npotassic ferrocyanide solution added to 10 c.c. of CO blood produces an\r\nintense bright red; normal blood becomes dark brown.\r\n\r\nFour parts of CO blood, diluted with 4 parts of water and shaken with 3\r\nvols. of 1 per cent. tannin solution, become at first bright red with a\r\nbluish tinge, and remain so persistently. Normal blood, on the other\r\nhand, also strikes bright red at first, but with a yellowish tinge; at\r\nthe end of 1 hour it becomes brownish, and finally in 24 hours grey.\r\nThis is stated to be delicate enough to detect 0·0023 per cent. in air.\r\n\r\nIf blood be diluted with 40 times its volume of water, and 5 drops of\r\nphenylhydrazin solution be added, CO blood strikes rose-red; normal\r\nblood grey-violet.[51]\r\n\r\n[51] A.

Rend._, cvi. 289.\r\n\r\nStevenson, in one of the cases detailed at p. 67, found the blood in the\r\nright auricle to contain 0·03 per cent. by weight of CO.\r\n\r\n(2) =Preparation of Hæmatin Crystals=--(Teichmann’s crystals).--A\r\nportion of the borax solution is diluted with 5 or 6 parts of water, and\r\none or more drops of a 5 or 6 per cent. solution of zinc acetate added,\r\nso long as a brownish-coloured precipitate is thrown down. The\r\nprecipitate is filtered off by means of a miniature filter, and then\r\nremoved on to a watch-glass. The precipitate may now be dissolved in 1\r\nor 2 c.c. of acetic acid, and examined by the spectroscope it will show\r\nthe spectrum of hæmatin. A minute crystal of sodic chloride being then\r\nadded to the acetic acid solution, it is allowed to evaporate to dryness\r\nat the ordinary temperature, and crystals of hæmatin hydrochlorate\r\nresult. There are other methods of obtaining the crystals. When a drop\r\nof fresh blood is simply boiled with glacial acetic acid, on\r\nevaporation, prismatic crystals are obtained.\r\n\r\nHæmatin is insoluble in water, alcohol, chloroform, and in cold dilute\r\nacetic and hydrochloric acids. It may, however, be dissolved in an\r\nalcoholic solution of potassic carbonate, in solutions of the caustic\r\nalkalies, and in boiling acetic and hydrochloric acids. Hoppe-Seyler\r\nascribes to the crystals the formula C₆₈H₇₀N₈Fe₂O₁₀2HCl. Thudichum\r\nconsiders that the pure crystals contain no chlorine, and are therefore\r\nthose of hæmatin. It is the resistance of the hæmatin to decomposition\r\nand to ordinary solvents that renders it possible to identify a certain\r\nstain to be that of blood, after long periods of time. Dr. Tidy seems to\r\nhave been able to obtain blood reactions from a stain which was supposed\r\nto be 100 years old. The crystals are of a dark-red colour, and present\r\nthemselves in three forms, of which that of the rhombic prism is the\r\nmost common (see fig.). But crystals like _b_, having six sides, also\r\noccur, and also crystals similar to _c_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIf the spot under examination has been scraped off an iron implement the\r\nhæmatin is not so easily extracted, but Dragendorff states that borax\r\nsolution at 50° dissolves it, and separates it from the iron. Felletar\r\nhas also extracted blood in combination with iron rust, by means of warm\r\nsolution of caustic potash, and, after neutralisation with acetic acid,\r\nhas precipitated the hæmin by means of tannin, and obtained from the\r\ntannin precipitate, by means of acetic acid, Teichmann’s crystals. A\r\nlittle of the rust may also be placed in a test tube, powdered ammonium\r\nchloride added, also a little strong ammonia, and after a time filtered;\r\na small quantity of the filtrate is placed on a slide with a crystal of\r\nsodium chloride and evaporated at a gentle heat, then glacial acetic\r\nacid added and allowed to cool; in this way hæmin crystals have been\r\nobtained from a crowbar fifty days after having been blood-stained.[54]\r\n\r\n[54] _Brit. Med. Journ._, Feb. 17, 1894.\r\n\r\n(3) =Guaiacum Test.=--This test depends upon the fact that a solution of\r\nhæmoglobin develops a beautiful blue colour, if brought into contact\r\nwith fresh tincture of guaiacum and peroxide of hydrogen. The simplest\r\nway to obtain this reaction is to moisten the suspected stain with\r\ndistilled water; after allowing sufficient time for the water to\r\ndissolve out some of the blood constituents, moisten a bit of\r\nfilter-paper with the weak solution thus obtained; drop on to the moist\r\nspace a single drop of tincture of guaiacum which has been prepared by\r\ndigesting the inner portions of guaiacum resin in alcohol, and which has\r\nbeen already tested on known blood, so as to ascertain that it is really\r\ngood and efficient for the purpose; and, lastly, a few drops of peroxide\r\nof hydrogen. Dragendorff uses his borax solution, and, after a little\r\ndilution with water, adds the tincture and then Heunefeld’s turpentine\r\nsolution, which is composed of equal parts of absolute alcohol,\r\nchloroform, and French turpentine, to which one part of acetic acid has\r\nbeen added. The chloroform separates, and, if blood was present, is of a\r\nblue colour.\r\n\r\n§ 36. To prove by chemical and physical methods that a certain stain is\r\nthat of blood, is often only one step in the inquiry, the next question\r\nbeing whether the blood is that of man or of animals. The\r\nblood-corpuscles of man are larger than those of any domestic animal\r\ninhabiting Europe. The diameter of the average red blood-corpuscle is\r\nabout the 1/126 of a millimetre, or 7·9 µ.[55] The corpuscles of man and\r\nof mammals, generally speaking, are round, those of birds and reptiles\r\noval, so that there can be no confusion between man and birds, fishes or\r\nreptiles; if the corpuscles are circular in shape the blood will be that\r\nof a mammal. By careful measurements, Dr. Richardson, of Pennsylvania,\r\naffirms that it is quite possible to distinguish human blood from that\r\nof all common animals. He maintains, and it is true, that, by using very\r\nhigh magnifying powers and taking much trouble, an expert can\r\nsatisfactorily identify human blood, if he has some half-dozen drops of\r\nblood from different animals--such as the sheep, goat, horse, dog, cat,\r\n&c., all fresh at hand for comparison, and _if the human blood is\r\nnormal_. However, when we come to the blood of persons suffering from\r\ndisease, there are changes in the diameter and even the form of the\r\ncorpuscles which much complicate the matter; while, in blood-stains of\r\nany age, the blood-corpuscles, even with the most artfully-contrived\r\nsolvent, are so distorted in shape that he would be a bold man who\r\nshould venture on any definite conclusion as to whether the blood was\r\ncertainly human, more especially if he had to give evidence in a\r\ncriminal case.\r\n\r\n[55] 1/3200 of an inch; the Greek letter µ is the micro-millimetre, or\r\n1000th of a millimetre, ·00003937 inch.\r\n\r\nNeumann affirms that the pattern which the fibrin or coagulum of the\r\nblood forms is peculiar to each animal, and Dr. Day, of Geelong, has\r\nindependently confirmed his researches: this very interesting\r\nobservation perhaps has not received the attention it merits.\r\n\r\nWhen there is sufficient of the blood present to obtain a few milligrms.\r\nof ash, there is a means of distinguishing human blood from that of\r\nother common mammals, which has been neglected by authorities on the\r\nsubject, and which may be found of real value. Its principle depends\r\nupon the relative amounts of potassium and sodium in the blood of man as\r\ncompared with that in the blood of domestic animals. In the blood of the\r\ncow, sheep, fowl, pig, and horse, the sodium very much exceeds the\r\npotassium in the ash; thus the proportion of sodium oxide to that of\r\npotassium oxide in the blood of the sheep is as K₂O ·1 : Na₂O ·6; in\r\nthat of the cow, as 1 : 8; in that of the domestic fowl, as 1 : 16;\r\nwhile the same substances in human blood are sometimes equal, and vary\r\nfrom 1 : 1 to 1 : 4 as extremes, the mean numbers being as 1 : 2·2. The\r\npotassium is greater in quantity in the blood-corpuscles than in the\r\nblood serum; but, even in blood serum, the same marked differences\r\nbetween the blood of man and that of many animals is apparent. Thus, the\r\nproportion of potash to soda being as 1 : 10 in human blood, the\r\nproportion in sheep’s blood is 1 to 15·7; in horse’s serum as 1 to 16·4;\r\nand in the ox as 1 to 17. Since blood, when burnt, leaves from 6 to 7\r\nper thousand of ash, it follows that a quantitative analysis of the\r\nrelative amounts of potassium and sodium can only be satisfactorily\r\neffected when sufficient of the blood is at the analyst’s disposal to\r\ngive a weighable quantity of mineral matter. On the other hand, much\r\nwork requires to be done before this method of determining that the\r\nblood is either human, or, at all events, not that of an herbivorous\r\nanimal, can be relied on. We know but little as to the effect of the\r\ningestion of sodium or potassium salts on either man or animals, and it\r\nis possible--nay, probable--that a more or less entire substitution of\r\nthe one for the other may, on certain diets, take place. Bunge seems in\r\nsome experiments to have found no sodium in the blood of either the cat\r\nor the dog.\r\n\r\nThe source from which the blood has emanated may, in a few cases, be\r\nconjectured from the discovery, by microscopical examination, of hair or\r\nof buccal, nasal, or vaginal epithelium, &c., mixed with the\r\nblood-stain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III.--POISONOUS GASES: CARBON MONOXIDE--CHLORINE--HYDRIC SULPHIDE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--Carbon Monoxide.\r\n\r\n§ 37. Carbon monoxide, CO, is a colourless, odourless gas of 0·96709 sp.\r\ngravity. A litre weighs 1·25133 grm. It is practically insoluble in\r\nwater. It unites with many metals, forming gaseous or volatile\r\ncompounds, _e.g._, nickel carbon oxide, Ni(CO)₄, is a fluid volatilising\r\nat 40°. These compounds have, so far as is known, the same effects as\r\nCO.\r\n\r\nWhenever carbon is burned with an insufficient supply of air, CO in a\r\ncertain quantity is produced. It is always present in ordinary domestic\r\nproducts of combustion, and must be exhaled from the various chimneys of\r\na large city in considerable volumes. A “smoky” chimney or a defective\r\nflue will therefore introduce carbon monoxide into living-rooms. The\r\nvapour from burning coke or burning charcoal is rich in carbon monoxide.\r\nIt is always a constituent of coal gas, in England the carbon monoxide\r\nin coal gas amounting to about 8 per cent. Poisoning by coal gas is\r\npractically poisoning by carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide is also the\r\nchief constituent in water gas.\r\n\r\nCarbon monoxide poisoning occurs far more frequently in France and\r\nGermany than in England; in those countries the vapour evolved from\r\nburning charcoal is a favourite method of suicide, on account of the\r\nsupposed painlessness of the death. It has also occasionally been used\r\nas an instrument of murder. In this country carbon monoxide poisoning\r\nmainly takes place accidentally as the effect of breathing coal gas;\r\npossibly it is the secret and undetected cause of ill health where\r\nchimneys “smoke”; and it may have something to do with the sore throats\r\nand debility so often noticed when persons breathe for long periods air\r\ncontaminated by small leakages of coal gas.\r\n\r\nThe large gas-burners (geysers) emit in burning under certain conditions\r\nmuch carbon monoxide. It has been proved by Gréhant[56] that a bunsen\r\nburner “lit below” also evolves large quantities of the same poisonous\r\ngas.\r\n\r\n[56] _Compt. Rend. Soc. de Biol._, ix. 779-780.\r\n\r\n§ 38. =Symptoms.=--Nearly all the experience with regard to the symptoms\r\nproduced by carbon monoxide is derived from breathing not the pure gas,\r\nbut the gas diluted by air, by hydrogen or by carburetted hydrogen, as\r\nin coal gas, or mixed with large quantities of carbon dioxide. Two\r\nassistants of Christison breathed the pure gas: the one took from two to\r\nthree inhalations; he immediately became giddy, shivered, had headache\r\nand then became unconscious. The second took a bigger dose, for, after\r\nemptying his lungs as much as possible, he took from three to four\r\ninhalations; he fell back paralysed, became unconscious and remained\r\nhalf-an-hour insensible and had the appearance of death, the pulse being\r\nalmost extinguished. He was treated with inhalations of oxygen, but he\r\nremained for the rest of the day extremely ill; he had convulsive\r\nmuscular movements, stupor, headache, and quick irregular pulse; on this\r\npassing away he still suffered from nausea, giddiness, alternate feeling\r\nof heat and chilliness, with some fever, and in the night had a restless\r\nkind of sleep. The chemist Chenot was accidentally poisoned by the pure\r\ngas, and is stated to have fell as if struck by lightning after a single\r\ninspiration, and remained for a quarter of an hour unconscious. Other\r\nrecorded cases have shown very similar symptoms.\r\n\r\nThe pulse is at the onset large, full and frequent; it afterwards\r\nbecomes small, slow and irregular. The temperature sinks from 1° to 3°\r\nC. The respiration at first slow, later becomes rattling. As vomiting\r\noccurs often when the sufferer is insensible, the vomited matters have\r\nbeen drawn by inspiration into the trachea and even into the bronchi, so\r\nthat death takes place by suffocation.\r\n\r\nThe fatal coma may last even when the person has been removed from the\r\ngas from hours to days. Coma for three, four and five days from carbon\r\nmonoxide has been frequently observed. The longest case on record is\r\nthat of a person who was comatose for eight days, and died on the\r\ntwelfth day after the fatal inhalation. Consciousness in this case\r\nreturned, but the patient again fell into stupor and died.\r\n\r\nThe slighter kinds of poisoning by carbon monoxide, as in the\r\nStaffordshire case recorded by Dr. Reid, in which for a long time a much\r\ndiluted gas has been breathed, produce pronounced headache and a general\r\nfeeling of ill health and _malaise_, deepening, it may be, into a fatal\r\nslumber, unless the person is removed from the deadly atmosphere. To the\r\nheadache generally succeeds nausea, a feeling of oppression in the\r\ntemples, a noise in the ears, feebleness, anxiety and a dazed condition\r\ndeepening into coma. It is probably true that charcoal vapour is\r\ncomparatively painless, for when larger amounts of the gas are breathed\r\nthe insensibility comes on rapidly and the faces of those who have\r\nsuccumbed as a rule are placid. Vomiting, without being constant, is a\r\nfrequent symptom, and in fatal cases the fæces and urine are passed\r\ninvoluntarily. There are occasional deviations from this picture;\r\ntetanic strychnine-like convulsions have been noticed and a condition of\r\nexcitement in the non-fatal cases as if from alcohol; in still rarer\r\ncases temporary mania has been produced.\r\n\r\nIn non-fatal but moderately severe cases of poisoning sequelæ follow,\r\nwhich in some respects imitate the sequelæ seen on recovery from the\r\ninfectious fevers. A weakness of the understanding, incapacity for\r\nrational and connected thought, and even insanity have been noticed.\r\nThere is a special liability to local inflammations, which may pass into\r\ngangrene. Various paralyses have been observed. Eruptions of the skin,\r\nsuch as herpes, pemphigus and others. Sugar in the urine is an almost\r\nconstant concomitant of carbon monoxide poisoning.\r\n\r\n§ 39. The poisonous action of carbon monoxide is, without doubt, due to\r\nthe fact that it is readily absorbed by the blood, entering into a\r\ndefinite chemical compound with the hæmoglobin; this combination is more\r\nstable than the similar compound with oxygen gas, and is therefore slow\r\nin elimination.\r\n\r\nHence the blood of an animal remaining in an atmosphere containing\r\ncarbon monoxide is continually getting poorer in oxygen, richer in\r\ncarbon monoxide. Gréhant has shown that if an animal breathes for one\r\nhour a mixture of 0·5 carbon monoxide to 1000 oxygen, the blood contains\r\nat the end of that time one-third less oxygen than normal, and contains\r\n152 times more carbon monoxide than in the mixture. An atmosphere of 10\r\nper cent. carbon monoxide changes the blood so quickly, that after from\r\n10 to 25 seconds the blood contains 4 per cent. of carbon monoxide, and\r\nafter from 75 to 90 seconds 18·4 per cent. Breathing even for half an\r\nhour an atmosphere containing from 0·07 to 0·12 per cent. carbon\r\nmonoxide renders a fourth part of the red corpuscles of the blood\r\nincapable of uniting with oxygen.\r\n\r\nThe blood is, however, never saturated with carbon monoxide, for the\r\nanimal dies long before this takes place.\r\n\r\nThe characteristics of the blood and its spectroscopic appearances are\r\ndescribed at p. 58.\r\n\r\nBesides the action on the blood there is an action on the nervous\r\nsystem. Kobert,[57] in relation to this subject, says:--“That CO has a\r\ndirect action on the nervous system is shown in a marked manner when an\r\natmosphere of oxygen, with at least 20 per cent. carbon oxide, is\r\nbreathed; for in the first minute there is acute cramp or total\r\nparalysis of the limbs, when the blood in no way attains the saturation\r\nsufficiently great to account for such symptoms. Geppert has, through a\r\nspecial research, shown that an animal suffocated by withdrawal of\r\noxygen, increases the number and depth of the respirations; but when the\r\nanimal is submitted to CO, in which case there is quite as much a\r\nwithdrawal of oxygen as in the former case, yet the animal is not in a\r\ncondition to strengthen its respiratory movements; Geppert hence rightly\r\nconcludes that CO must have a primary specific injurious action on the\r\nnerve centres. I (Kobert) am inclined to go a step further, and, on the\r\nground of unpublished researches, to maintain that CO not only affects\r\ninjuriously the ganglion cells of the brain, but also the peripheral\r\nnerves (_e.g._, the phrenic), as well as divers other tissues, as\r\nmuscles and glands, and that it causes so rapidly such a high degree of\r\ndegeneration as not to be explained through simple slow suffocation;\r\neven gangrene may be caused.”\r\n\r\n[57] _Lehrbuch der Intoxicationen_, 526.\r\n\r\nIt is this rapid degeneration which is the cause of the enormous\r\nincrease of the products of the decomposition of albumin, found\r\nexperimentally in animals.\r\n\r\n§ 40. =Post-mortem Appearances.=--The face, neck, chest, abdomen are\r\nfrequently covered with patches of irregular form and of clear rose-red\r\nor bluish-red colour; these patches are not noticed on the back, and\r\nthus do not depend upon the gravitation of the blood to the lower or\r\nmost dependent part of the body; similar red patches have been noticed\r\nin poisoning by prussic acid; the cause of this phenomenon is ascribed\r\nto the paralysis of the small arteries of the skin, which, therefore,\r\nbecome injected with the changed blood. The blood throughout is\r\ngenerally fluid, and of a fine peculiar red colour, with a bluish tinge.\r\nThe face is mostly calm, pale, and there is seldom any foam about the\r\nlips. Putrefaction is mostly remarkably retarded. There is nearly always\r\na congestion of some of the internal organs; sometimes, and indeed\r\nusually, the membranes of the brain are strongly injected; sometimes the\r\ncongestion is mainly in the lungs, which may be œdematous with effusion;\r\nand in a third class of cases the congestion is most marked in the\r\nabdominal cavity.\r\n\r\nThe right heart is commonly filled with blood, and the left side\r\ncontains only a little blood.\r\n\r\nPoisoning by a small dose of carbon monoxide may produce but few\r\nstriking changes, and then it is only by a careful examination of the\r\nblood that evidence of the real nature of the case will be obtained.\r\n\r\n§ 41. =Mass poisonings by Carbon Monoxide.=--An interesting series of\r\ncases of poisoning by water gas occurred at Leeds in 1889, and have been\r\nrecorded by Dr. Thos. Stevenson.[58]\r\n\r\n[58] _Guy’s Hospital Reports_, 1889.\r\n\r\nWater gas is made by placing coke in a vertical cylinder and heating the\r\ncoke to a red heat. Through the red-hot coke, air is forced up from\r\nbelow for ten minutes; then the air is shut off and steam passes from\r\nabove downwards for four minutes; the gas passes through a scrubber, and\r\nthen through a ferric oxide purifier to remove SH₂. It contains about 50\r\nper cent. of hydrogen and 40 per cent. of carbon monoxide, that is,\r\nabout five times more carbon monoxide than coal gas.\r\n\r\nOn November 20, 1889, two men, R. French and H. Fenwick, both\r\nintemperate men, occupied a cabin at the Leeds Forge Works; the cabin\r\nwas 540 c. feet in capacity, and was lighted by two burners, each\r\nburning 5·5 c. feet of water gas per hour; the cabin was warmed by a\r\ncooking stove, also burning water gas, the products of combustion\r\nescaping into the cabin. Both men went into the cabin after breakfast\r\n(8.30 A.M.). French was seen often going to and fro, and Fenwick was\r\nseen outside at 10.30 A.M. At 11.30 the foreman accompanied French to\r\nthe cabin, and found Fenwick asleep, as he thought. At 12.30 P.M.\r\nFrench’s son took the men their dinner, which was afterwards found\r\nuneaten. At that time French also appeared to be asleep; he was shaken\r\nby his son, upon which he nodded to his son to leave. The door of the\r\ncabin appears to have been shut, and all through the morning the lights\r\nkept burning; no smell was experienced. At 2.30 P.M. both the men were\r\ndiscovered dead. It was subsequently found that the stove was unlighted,\r\nand the water gas supply turned on.\r\n\r\nWhat attracted most attention to this case was the strange incident at\r\nthe _post-mortem_ examination. The autopsies were begun two days after\r\nthe death, November 22, in a room of 39,000 c. feet capacity. There were\r\npresent Mr. T. Scattergood (senior), Mr. Arthur Scattergood (junior),\r\nMr. Hargreaves, three local surgeons, Messrs. Brown, Loe and Jessop, and\r\ntwo assistants, Pugh and Spray. Arthur Scattergood first fainted, Mr.\r\nScattergood, senior, also had some peculiar sensations, viz., tingling\r\nin the head and slight giddiness; then Mr. Pugh became faint and\r\nstaggered; and Mr. Loe, Mr. Brown, and Mr. Spray all complained.\r\n\r\nThese symptoms were not produced, as was at first thought, by some\r\nvolatile gas or vapour emanating from the bodies of the poisoned men,\r\nbut, as subsequently discovered, admitted of a very simple explanation;\r\neight burners in the room were turned partly on and not lighted, and\r\neach of the eight burners poured water gas into the room.\r\n\r\nIn 1891 occurred some cases of poisoning[59] by CO which are probably\r\nunique. The cases in question happened in January in a family at\r\nDarlaston. The first sign of anything unusual having happened to the\r\nfamily most affected was the fact that up to 9 A.M., Sunday morning,\r\nJanuary 18, none of the family had been seen about. The house was broken\r\ninto by the neighbours; and the father, mother, and three children were\r\nfound in bed apparently asleep, and all efforts to rouse them utterly\r\nfailed. The medical men summoned arrived about 10 A.M. and found the\r\nfather and mother in a state of complete unconsciousness, and two of the\r\nchildren, aged 11 and 14 years, suffering from pain and sickness and\r\ndiarrhœa; the third child had by this time been removed to a\r\nneighbouring cottage.\r\n\r\n[59] “Notes on cases of poisoning by the inhalation of carbon monoxide,”\r\nby Dr. George Reid, Medical Officer of Health, County of Stafford.\r\n_Public Health_, vol. iii. 364.\r\n\r\nDr. Partridge, who was in attendance, remained with the patients three\r\nhours, when he also began to suffer from headache; while others, who\r\nremained in the house longer, suffered more severely and complained of\r\nan indefinite feeling of exhaustion. These symptoms pointed to some\r\nexciting cause associated with the surroundings of the cottage;\r\nconsequently, in the afternoon the two children were removed to another\r\ncottage, and later on the father and mother also. All the patients, with\r\nthe exception of the mother, who was still four days afterwards\r\nsuffering from the effects of an acute attack, had completely recovered.\r\nThe opinion that the illness was owing to some local cause was\r\nsubsequently strengthened by the fact that two canaries and a cat had\r\ndied in the night in the kitchen of the cottage; the former in a cage\r\nand the latter in a cupboard, the door of which was open. Also in the\r\nsame house on the opposite side of the road, the occupants of which had\r\nfor some time suffered from headache and depression, two birds were\r\nfound dead in their cage in the kitchen. It is important to notice that\r\nall these animals died in the respective kitchens of the cottages, and,\r\ntherefore, on the ground floor, while the families occupied the first\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\nThe father stated that for a fortnight or three weeks previous to the\r\nserious illness, he and the whole family had complained of severe\r\nfrontal headache and a feeling of general depression. This feeling was\r\ncontinuous day and night in the case of the rest of the family, but in\r\nhis case, during the day, after leaving the house for his work, it\r\ngradually passed off, to return again during the night. The headaches\r\nwere so intense that the whole family regularly applied vinegar rags to\r\ntheir heads, on going to bed each night during this period, for about\r\nthree weeks. About two o’clock on Sunday morning the headaches became so\r\nsevere that the mother got out of bed and renewed the application of\r\nvinegar and water all round, after which they all fell asleep, and, so\r\nfar as the father and mother were concerned, remained completely\r\nunconscious until Monday morning.\r\n\r\nA man who occupied the house opposite the house tenanted by the\r\nlast-mentioned family informed the narrator (Dr. Reid) that on Sunday\r\nmorning the family, consisting of four, were taken seriously ill with a\r\nfeeling of sickness and depression accompanied by headache; and he also\r\nstated that for some time they had smelt what he termed a “fire stink”\r\nissuing from the cellar.\r\n\r\nThe cottage in which the family lived that had suffered so severely was\r\nsituated about 20 or 30 yards from the shaft of a disused coal mine, and\r\nwas the end house of a row of cottages. It had a cellar opening into the\r\nouter air, but this opening was usually covered over by means of a piece\r\nof wood. The adjoining house to this, the occupants of which had for\r\nsome time suffered from headache, although to a less extent, had a\r\ncellar with a similar opening, but supplied with an ill-fitting cover.\r\nThe house on the opposite side of the road, in which the two birds were\r\nfound dead, had a cellar opening both at the front and the back; but\r\nboth these openings, until a little before the occurrence detailed, had\r\nbeen kept closed. The cellars in all cases communicated with the houses\r\nby means of doors opening into the kitchens. According to the general\r\naccount of the occupants, the cellars had smelled of “fire stink,”\r\nwhich, in their opinion, proceeded from the adjoining mine.\r\n\r\nThe shaft of the disused mine communicated with a mine in working order,\r\nand, to encourage the ventilation in this mine, a furnace had for some\r\nweeks been lit and suspended in the shaft. This furnace had set fire to\r\nthe coal in the disused mine and smoke had been issuing from the shaft\r\nfor four weeks previously. Two days previous to the inquiry the opening\r\nof the shaft had been closed over with a view to extinguish the fire.\r\n\r\nDr. Reid considered, from the symptoms and all the circumstances of the\r\ncase, that the illness was due to carbon monoxide gas penetrating into\r\nthe cellars from the mine, and from thence to the living- and\r\nsleeping-rooms. A sample of the air yielded 0·015 per cent. of carbon\r\nmonoxide, although the sample had been taken after the cellar windows\r\nhad been open for twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n§ 42. =Detection of Carbon Monoxide.=--It may often be necessary to\r\ndetect carbon monoxide in air and to estimate its amount. The detection\r\nin air, if the carbon monoxide is in any quantity, is easy enough; but\r\ntraces of carbon monoxide are difficult. Where amounts of carbon\r\nmonoxide in air from half a per cent. upwards are reasonably presumed to\r\nexist, the air is measured in a gas measuring apparatus and passed into\r\nan absorption pipette charged with alkaline pyrogallic acid, and when\r\nall the oxygen has been abstracted, then the residual nitrogen and gases\r\nare submitted to an ammoniacal solution of cuprous chloride.\r\n\r\nThe solution of cuprous chloride is prepared by dissolving 10·3 grms. of\r\ncopper oxide in 150 c.c. of strong hydrochloric acid and filling the\r\nflask with copper turnings; the copper reduces the cupric chloride to\r\ncuprous chloride; the end of the reduction is known by the solution\r\nbecoming colourless. The colourless acid solution is poured into some\r\n1500 c.c. of water, and the cuprous chloride settles to the bottom as a\r\nprecipitate. The supernatant fluid is poured off as completely as\r\npossible and the precipitate washed into a quarter litre flask, with 100\r\nto 150 c.c. of distilled water and ammonia led into the solution until\r\nit becomes of a pale blue colour. The solution is made up to 200 c.c. so\r\nas to contain about 7·3 grms. per cent. of cuprous chloride.\r\n\r\nSuch a solution is an absorbent of carbon monoxide; it also absorbs\r\nethylene and acetylene.\r\n\r\nA solution of cuprous chloride which has absorbed CO gives it up on\r\nbeing treated with potassic bichromate and acid. It has been proposed by\r\nWanklyn to deprive large quantities of air of oxygen, then to absorb any\r\ncarbon monoxide present with cuprous chloride, and, lastly, to free the\r\ncuprous chloride from the last gas by treatment with acid bichromate, so\r\nas to be able to study the properties of a small quantity of pure gas.\r\n\r\nBy far the most reliable method to detect small quantities of carbon\r\nmonoxide is, however, as proposed by Hempel, to absorb it in the lungs\r\nof a living animal.\r\n\r\nA mouse is placed between two funnels joined together at their mouths by\r\na band of thin rubber; one of the ends of the double funnel is connected\r\nwith an aspirator, and the air thus sucked through, say for half an hour\r\nor more; the mouse is then killed by drowning, and a control mouse,\r\nwhich has not been exposed to a CO atmosphere, is also drowned; the\r\nbodies of both mice are cut in two in the region of the heart, and the\r\nblood collected. Each sample of blood is diluted in the same proportion\r\nand spectroscopically examined in the manner detailed at p. 58.\r\n\r\nWinkler found that, when large volumes of gas were used (at least 10\r\nlitres), 0·05 per cent. of carbon monoxide could be readily detected.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--Chlorine.\r\n\r\n§ 43. Chlorine is a yellow-green gas, which may, by cold and pressure,\r\nbe condensed into a liquid. Its specific gravity is, as compared with\r\nhydrogen, 35·37; as compared with air, 2·45; a litre under standard\r\nconditions weighs 3·167 grms. It is soluble in water.\r\n\r\nThe usual method of preparation is the addition of hydrochloric acid to\r\nbleaching powder, which latter substance is hypochlorite of lime mixed\r\nwith calcic chloride and, it may be, a little caustic lime. Another\r\nmethod is to treat manganese dioxide with hydrochloric acid or to act on\r\nmanganese dioxide and common salt with sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\nAccidents are liable to occur with chlorine gas from its extensive use\r\nas a disinfectant and also in its manufacture. In the “Weldon” process\r\nof manufacturing bleaching powder, a thick layer of lime is placed on\r\nthe floor of special chambers; chlorine gas is passed into these\r\nchambers for about four days; then the gas is turned off; the unabsorbed\r\ngas is drawn off by an exhaust or absorbed by a lime distributor and the\r\ndoors opened. Two hours afterwards the men go in to pack the powder. The\r\npackers, in order to be able to work in the chambers, wear a respirator\r\nconsisting of about thirty folds of damp flannel; this is tightly bound\r\nround the mouth with the nostrils free and resting upon it. The men are\r\nobliged to inhale the breath through the flannel and exhale through the\r\nnostril, otherwise they would, in technical jargon, be “gassed.” Some\r\nalso wear goggles to protect their eyes. Notwithstanding these\r\nprecautions they suffer generally from chest complaints.\r\n\r\n§ 44. =Effects.=--Free chlorine, in the proportion of 0·04 to 0·06 per\r\nthousand, taken into the lungs is dangerous to life, since directly\r\nchlorine attacks a moist mucous membrane, hydrochloric acid is formed.\r\nThe effects of chlorine can hardly be differentiated from hydrochloric\r\nacid gas, and Lehmann found that 1·5 per thousand of this latter gas\r\naffected animals, causing at once uneasiness, evidence of pain with\r\ngreat dyspnœa, and later coma. The eyes and the mucous membrane of the\r\nnose were attacked. Anatomical changes took place in the cornea, as\r\nevidenced by a white opacity.\r\n\r\nIn cases that recovered, a purulent discharge came from the nostrils\r\nwith occasional necrosis of the mucous membrane. The symptoms in man are\r\nsimilar; there is great tightness of the breath, irritation of the nose\r\nand eyes, cough and, with small repeated doses, bronchitis with all its\r\nattendant evils. Bleaching powder taken by the mouth is not so deadly.\r\nHertwig has given 1000 grms. to horses, 30 grms. to sheep and goats, and\r\n15 grms. to dogs without producing death. The symptoms in these cases\r\nwere quickening of the pulse and respiration, increased peristaltic\r\naction of the bowels and a stimulation of the kidney secretion. The\r\nurine smelt of chlorine.\r\n\r\n§ 45. =Post-mortem Appearances.=--Hyperæmia of the lungs, with\r\necchymoses and pneumonic patches with increased secretion of the\r\nbronchial tubes. In the mucous membrane of the stomach, ecchymoses. The\r\nalkalescence of the blood is diminished and there may be external signs\r\nof bleaching. Only exceptionally has any chlorine smell been perceived\r\nin the internal organs.\r\n\r\n§ 46. =Detection of Free Chlorine.=--The usual method of detection is to\r\nprepare a solution of iodide of potassium and starch and to soak strips\r\nof filter-paper in this solution. Such a strip, when moistened and\r\nsubmitted to a chlorine atmosphere, is at once turned blue, because\r\nchlorine displaces iodine from its combination with potassium.\r\nLitmus-paper, indigo blue or other vegetable colours are at once\r\nbleached.\r\n\r\nTo estimate the amount of chlorine a known volume of the air is drawn\r\nthrough a solution of potassium iodide, and the amount of iodine set\r\nfree, determined by titration with sodic hyposulphite, as detailed at p.\r\n74.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--Hydric Sulphide (Sulphuretted Hydrogen).\r\n\r\n§ 47. Hydric sulphide, SH₂, is a colourless transparent gas of sp.\r\ngravity 1·178. It burns with a blue flame, forming water and sulphur\r\ndioxide, and is soluble in water; water absorbing about three volumes\r\nat ordinary temperatures. It is decomposed by either chlorine gas or\r\nsulphur dioxide.\r\n\r\nIt is a common gas as a constituent of the air of sewers or cesspools,\r\nand emanates from moist slag or moist earth containing pyrites or\r\nmetallic sulphides; it also occurs whenever albuminous matter putrefies;\r\nhence it is a common constituent of the emanations from corpses of\r\neither man or animals. It has a peculiar and intense odour, generally\r\ncompared to that of rotten eggs; this is really not a good comparison,\r\nfor it is comparing the gas with itself, rotten eggs always producing\r\nSH₂; it is often associated with ammonium sulphide.\r\n\r\n§ 48. =Effects.=--Pure hydric sulphide is never met with out of the\r\nchemist’s laboratory, in which it is a common reagent either as a gas or\r\nin solution; so that the few cases of poisoning by the pure gas, or\r\nrather the pure gas mixed with ordinary air, have been confined to\r\nlaboratories.\r\n\r\nThe greater number of cases have occurred accidentally to men working in\r\nsewers, or cleaning out cesspools and the like. In small quantities it\r\nis always present in the air of towns, as shown by the blackening of any\r\nsilver ornament not kept bright by frequent use.\r\n\r\nIt is distinctly a blood poison, the gas uniting with the alkali of the\r\nblood, and the sulphide thus produced partly decomposing again in the\r\nlung and breathed out as SH₂. Lehmann[60] has studied the effects on\r\nanimals; an atmosphere containing from 1 to 3 per thousand of SH₂ kills\r\nrabbits and cats within ten minutes; the symptoms are mainly convulsions\r\nand great dyspnœa. An atmosphere containing from 0·4 to 0·8 per thousand\r\nproduces a local irritating action on the mucous membranes of the\r\nrespiratory tract, and death follows from an inflammatory œdema of the\r\nlung preceded by convulsions; there is also a paralysis of the nervous\r\ncentres. Lehmann has recorded the case of three men who breathed 0·2 per\r\nthousand of SH₂: within from five to eight minutes there was intense\r\nirritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, and after thirty minutes they\r\nwere unable to bear the atmosphere any longer. Air containing 0·5 per\r\nthousand of SH₂ is, according to Lehmann, the utmost amount that can be\r\nbreathed; this amount causes in half an hour smarting of the eyes, nasal\r\ncatarrh, dyspnœa, cough, palpitation, shivering, great muscular\r\nweakness, headache and faintness with cold sweats. 0·7 to 0·8 per\r\nthousand is dangerous to human life, and from 1 to 1·5 per thousand\r\ndestroys life rapidly. The symptoms may occur some little time after the\r\nwithdrawal of the person from the poisonous atmosphere; for example,\r\nCahn records the case of a student who prepared SH₂ in a laboratory and\r\nwas exposed to the gas for two hours; he then went home to dinner and\r\nthe symptoms first commenced in more than an hour after the first\r\nbreathing of pure air. Taylor[61] records an unusual case of poisoning\r\nin 1857 at Cleator Moor. Some cottages had been built upon iron slag,\r\nthe slag contained sulphides of calcium and iron; a heavy storm of rain\r\nwashed through the slag and considerable volumes of SH₂ with, no doubt,\r\nother gases diffused during the night through the cottages and killed\r\nthree adults and three children.\r\n\r\n[60] K. B. Lehmann, _Arch. f. Hygiene_, Bd. xiv., 1892, 135.\r\n\r\n[61] _Principles and Practice of Medl. Jurisp._, vol. ii. 122.\r\n\r\n§ 49. =Post-mortem Appearances.=--The so-called apoplectic form of SH₂\r\npoisoning, in which the sufferer dies within a minute or two, shows no\r\nspecial change. The most frequent change in slower poisoning is,\r\naccording to Lehmann, œdema of the lungs. A green colour of the face and\r\nof the whole body is sometimes present, but not constant. A\r\nspectroscopic examination of the blood may also not lead to any\r\nconclusion, the more especially as the spectrum of sulphur methæmoglobin\r\nmay occur in any putrid blood. The pupils in some cases have been found\r\ndilated; in others not so.\r\n\r\n=Chronic poisoning.=--Chronic poisoning by SH₂ is of considerable\r\ninterest in a public health point of view. The symptoms appear to be\r\nconjunctivitis, headache, dyspepsia and anæmia. A predisposition to\r\nboils has also been noted.\r\n\r\n§ 50. =Detection.=--Both ammonium and hydric sulphides blacken silver\r\nand filter-paper moistened with acetate of lead solution. To test for\r\nhydric sulphide in air a known quantity may be aspirated through a\r\nlittle solution of lead acetate. To estimate the quantity a decinormal\r\nsolution of iodine in potassium iodide[62] solution is used, and its\r\nexact strength determined by d.n. sodic hyposulphite solution[63]; the\r\nhyposulphite is run in from a burette into a known volume, _e.g._, 50\r\nc.c., of the d.n. iodine solution, until the yellow colour is almost\r\ngone; then a drop or two of fresh starch solution is added and the\r\nhyposulphite run in carefully, drop by drop, until the blue colour of\r\nthe starch disappears. If now a known volume of air is drawn through 50\r\nc.c. of the d.n. iodine solution, the reaction I₂ + SH₂ = 2HI + S will\r\ntake place, and for every 127 parts of iodine which have been converted\r\ninto hydriodic acid 17 parts by weight of SH₂ will be necessary; hence\r\non titrating the 50 c.c. of d.n. iodine solution, through which air\r\ncontaining SH₂ has been passed, less hyposulphite will be used than on\r\nthe previous occasion, each c.c. of the hyposulphite solution being\r\nequal to 1·11 c.c. or to 1·7 mgrm. of SH₂.\r\n\r\n[62] 12·7 grms. of iodine, 16·6 grms. of potassium iodide, dissolved in\r\na litre of water.\r\n\r\n[63] 24·8 grms. of sodic hyposulphite, dissolved in a litre of water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV.--ACIDS AND ALKALIES.\r\n\r\n    SULPHURIC ACID--HYDROCHLORIC ACID--NITRIC ACID--ACETIC\r\n    ACID--AMMONIA--POTASH--SODA--NEUTRAL SODIUM, POTASSIUM, AND AMMONIUM\r\n    SALTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--Sulphuric Acid.\r\n\r\n§ 51. Sulphuric acid (hydric sulphate, oil of vitriol, H₂SO₄) occurs in\r\ncommerce in varying degrees of strength or dilution; the strong\r\nsulphuric acid of the manufacturer, containing 100 per cent. of real\r\nacid (H₂SO₄), has a specific gravity of 1·850. The ordinary brown acid\r\nof commerce, coloured by organic matter and holding in solution metallic\r\nimpurities, chiefly lead and arsenic, has a specific gravity of about\r\n1·750; and contains 67·95 of anhydrous SO₃ = 85·42 of hydric sulphate.\r\n\r\nThere are also weaker acids used in commerce, particularly in\r\nmanufactories in which sulphuric acid is made, for special purposes\r\nwithout rectification. The British Pharmacopœia sulphuric acid is\r\ndirected to be of 1·843 specific gravity, which corresponds to 78·6 per\r\ncent. sulphuric anhydride, or 98·8 per cent. of hydric sulphate. The\r\ndilute sulphuric acid of the pharmacopœia should have a specific gravity\r\nof 1·094, and is usually said to correspond to 10·14 per cent. of\r\nanhydrous sulphuric acid; but, if Ure’s Tables are correct, such equals\r\n11·37 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe general characters of sulphuric acid are as follows:--When pure, it\r\nis a colourless, or, when impure, a dark brown to black, oily liquid,\r\nwithout odour at common temperatures, of an exceedingly acid taste,\r\ncharring most organic tissues rapidly, and, if mixed with water,\r\nevolving much heat. If 4 parts of the strong acid are mixed with 1 part\r\nof water at 0°, the mixture rises to a heat of 100°; a still greater\r\nheat is evolved by mixing 75 parts of acid with 27 of water.\r\n\r\nSulphuric acid is powerfully hygroscopic--3 parts will, in an ordinary\r\natmosphere, increase to nearly 4 in twenty-four hours; in common with\r\nall acids, it reddens litmus, yellows cochineal, and changes all\r\nvegetable colours. There is another form of sulphuric acid, extensively\r\nused in the arts, known under the name of “Nordhausen sulphuric acid,”\r\n“fuming acid,” formula H₂S₂O₄. This acid is produced by the distillation\r\nof dry ferrous sulphate, at a nearly white heat--either in earthenware\r\nor in green glass retorts; the distillate is received in sulphuric acid.\r\nAs thus manufactured, it is a dark fuming liquid of 1·9 specific\r\ngravity, and boiling at 53°. When artificially cooled down to 0°, the\r\nacid gradually deposits crystals, which consist of a definite compound\r\nof 2 atoms of anhydrous sulphuric acid and 1 atom of water. There is\r\nsome doubt as to the molecular composition of Nordhausen acid; it is\r\nusually considered as hydric sulphate saturated with sulphur dioxide.\r\nThis acid is manufactured chiefly in Bohemia, and is used, on a large\r\nscale, as a solvent for alizarine.\r\n\r\n§ 52. =Sulphur Trioxide, or Sulphuric Anhydride= (SO₃), itself may be\r\nmet with in scientific laboratories, but is not in commerce. Sulphur\r\ntrioxide forms thin needle-shaped crystals, arranged in feathery groups.\r\nSeen in mass, it is white, and has something the appearance of asbestos.\r\nIt fuses to a liquid at about 18°, boils at 35°, but, after this\r\noperation has been performed, the substance assumes an allotropic\r\ncondition, and then remains solid up to 100°; above 100° it melts,\r\nvolatilises, and returns to its normal condition. Sulphuric anhydride\r\nhisses when it is thrown into water, chemical combination taking place\r\nand sulphuric acid being formed. Sulphur trioxide is excessively\r\ncorrosive and poisonous.\r\n\r\nBesides the above forms of acid, there is an officinal preparation\r\ncalled “Aromatic Sulphuric Acid,” made by digesting sulphuric acid,\r\nrectified spirit, ginger, and cinnamon together. It contains 10·19 per\r\ncent. of SO₃, alcohol, and principles extracted from cinnamon and\r\nginger.\r\n\r\n§ 53. Sulphuric acid, in the free state, may not unfrequently be found\r\nin nature. The author has had under examination an effluent water from a\r\nDevonshire mine, which contained more than one grain of free sulphuric\r\nacid per gallon, and was accused, with justice, of destroying the fish\r\nin a river. It also exists in large quantities in volcanic springs. In a\r\ntorrent flowing from the volcano of Parcé, in the Andes, Boussingault\r\ncalculated that 15,000 tons of sulphuric acid and 11,000 tons of\r\nhydrochloric acid were yearly carried down. In the animal and vegetable\r\nkingdom, sulphuric acid exists, as a rule, in combination with bases,\r\nbut there is an exception in the saliva of the _Dolium galea_, a\r\nSicilian mollusc.\r\n\r\n§ 54. =Statistics.=--When something like 900,000 tons of sulphuric acid\r\nare produced annually in England alone, and when it is considered that\r\nsulphuric acid is used in the manufacture of most other acids, in the\r\nalkali trade, in the manufacture of indigo, in the soap trade, in the\r\nmanufacture of artificial manure, and in a number of technical\r\nprocesses, there is no cause for surprise that it should be the annual\r\ncause of many deaths.\r\n\r\nThe number of deaths from sulphuric acid will vary, other things being\r\nequal, in each country, according to the manufactures in that country\r\nemploying sulphuric acid. The number of cases of poisoning in England\r\nand Wales for ten years is given in the following table:--\r\n\r\nDEATHS FROM SULPHURIC ACID IN ENGLAND AND WALES FOR THE TEN YEARS ENDING\r\n1892.\r\n\r\n                     ACCIDENT OR NEGLIGENCE.\r\n\r\n  Ages,      1-5   5-15   15-25   25-65    65 &     Total\r\n                                          upwards\r\n  Males,      11     4       2      14       2        33\r\n  Females,     4   ...       2       3     ...         9\r\n            ---------------------------------------------\r\n  Totals,     15     4       4      17       2        42\r\n            ---------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                             SUICIDE.\r\n\r\n  Ages,                   15-25   25-65             Total\r\n  Males,                     4      25                29\r\n  Females,                   5      19                24\r\n                         ---------------------------------\r\n  Totals                     9      44                53\r\n                         ---------------------------------\r\n\r\nDuring the ten years, no case of murder through sulphuric acid is on\r\nrecord; hence the total deaths, as detailed in the tables, amount to 95,\r\nor a little over 9 a year.\r\n\r\nFalck,[64] in comparing different countries, considers the past\r\nstatistics to show that in France sulphuric acid has been the cause of\r\n4·5 to 5·5 per cent. of the total deaths from poison, and in England 5·9\r\nper cent. In England, France, and Denmark, taken together, 10·8, Prussia\r\n10·6; while in certain cities, as Berlin and Vienna, the percentages are\r\nmuch higher--Vienna showing 43·3 per cent., Berlin 90 per cent.\r\n\r\n[64] _Lehrbuch der praktischen Toxicologie_, p. 54.\r\n\r\n§ 55. =Accidental, Suicidal, and Criminal Poisoning.=--Deaths from\r\nsulphuric acid are, for the most part, accidental, occasionally\r\nsuicidal, and, still more rarely, criminal. In 53 out of 113 cases\r\ncollected by Böhm, in which the cause of the poisoning could, with fair\r\naccuracy, be ascertained, 45·3 per cent. were due to accident, 30·2 were\r\nsuicidal, and 24·5 per cent. were cases of criminal poisoning, the\r\nvictims being children.\r\n\r\nThe cause of the comparatively rare use of sulphuric acid by the\r\npoisoner is obvious. First of all, the acid can never be mixed with food\r\nwithout entirely changing its aspect; next, it is only in cases of\r\ninsensibility or paralysis that it could be administered to an adult,\r\nunless given by force, or under very exceptional circumstances; and\r\nlastly, the stains on the mouth and garments would at once betray, even\r\nto uneducated persons, the presence of something wrong. As an agent of\r\nmurder, then, sulphuric acid is confined in its use to young children,\r\nmore especially to the newly born.\r\n\r\nThere is a remarkable case related by Haagan,[65] in which an adult man,\r\nin full possession of his faculties, neither paralysed nor helpless, was\r\nmurdered by sulphuric acid. The wife of a day-labourer gave her husband\r\ndrops of sulphuric acid on sugar, instead of his medicine, and finally\r\nfinished the work by administering a spoonful of the acid. The spoon was\r\ncarried well to the back of the throat, so that the man took the acid at\r\na gulp. 11 grms. (171 grains) of sulphuric acid, partly in combination\r\nwith soda and potash, were separated from his stomach.\r\n\r\n[65] Gross: _Die Strafrechtspflege in Deutschland_, 4, 1861, Heft I. S.\r\n181.\r\n\r\nAccidental poisoning is most common among children. The oily,\r\nsyrupy-looking sulphuric acid, when pure, may be mistaken for glycerin\r\nor for syrup; and the dark commercial acid might, by a careless person,\r\nbe confounded with porter or any dark-looking medicine.\r\n\r\nSerious and fatal mistakes have not unfrequently arisen from the use of\r\ninjections. Deutsch[66] relates how a midwife, in error, administered to\r\nmother and child a sulphuric acid clyster; but little of the fluid could\r\nin either case have actually reached the rectum, for the mother\r\nrecovered in eight days, and in a little time the infant was also\r\nrestored to health. Sulphuric acid has caused death by injections into\r\nthe vagina. H. C. Lombard[67] observed a case of this kind, in which a\r\nwoman, aged thirty, injected half a litre of sulphuric acid into the\r\nvagina, for the purpose of procuring abortion. The result was not\r\nimmediately fatal, but the subsequent inflammation and its results so\r\noccluded the natural passage that the birth became impossible, and a\r\nCæsarean section extracted a dead child, the mother also dying.\r\n\r\n[66] _Preuss. Med. Vereins-Zeitung_, 1848, No. 13.\r\n\r\n[67] _Journ. de Chim. Méd._, tom. vii., 1831.\r\n\r\nAn army physician prescribed for a patient an emollient clyster. Since\r\nit was late at night, and the apothecary in bed, he prepared it himself;\r\nbut not finding linseed oil, woke the apothecary, who took a bottle out\r\nof one of the recesses and placed it on the table. The bottle contained\r\nsulphuric acid; a soldier noticed a peculiar odour and effervescence\r\nwhen the syringe was charged, but this was unheeded by the doctor. The\r\npatient immediately after the operation suffered the most acute agony,\r\nand died the following day; before his death, the bedclothes were found\r\ncorroded by the acid, and a portion of the bowel itself came away.[68]\r\n\r\n[68] Maschka’s _Handbuch_, p. 86; _Journal de Chimie Médicale_, t. i.\r\nNo. 8, 405, 1835.\r\n\r\n§56. =Fatal Dose.=--The amount necessary to kill an adult man is not\r\nstrictly known; fatality so much depends on the concentration of the\r\nacid and the condition of the person, more especially whether the\r\nstomach is full or empty, that it will be impossible ever to arrive at\r\nan accurate estimate. Christison’s case, in which 3·8 grms. (60 grains)\r\nof concentrated acid killed an adult, is the smallest lethal dose on\r\nrecord. Supposing that the man weighed 68½ kilo. (150 lbs.), this would\r\nbe in the proportion of ·05 grm. per kilo. There is also the case of a\r\nchild of one year, recorded by Taylor, in which 20 drops caused death.\r\nIf, however, it were asked in a court of law what dose of concentrated\r\nsulphuric acid would be dangerous, the proper answer would be: so small\r\na quantity as from 2 to 3 drops of the strong undiluted acid might cause\r\ndeath, more especially if conveyed to the back of the throat; for if it\r\nis improbable that on such a supposition death would be sudden, yet\r\nthere is a possibility of permanent injury to the gullet, with the\r\nresult of subsequent contraction, and the usual long and painful\r\nmalnutrition thereby induced. It may be laid down, therefore, that all\r\nquantities, even the smallest, of the _strong undiluted acid_ come under\r\nthe head of hurtful, noxious, and injurious.\r\n\r\n§ 57. =Local Action of Sulphuric Acid.=--The action of the acid on\r\nliving animal tissues has been studied of late by C. Ph. Falck and L.\r\nVietor.[69] Concentrated acid precipitates albumen, and then redissolves\r\nit; fibrin swells and becomes gelatinous; but if the acid is weak\r\n(_e.g._, 4 to 6 per cent.) it is scarcely changed. Muscular fibre is at\r\nfirst coloured amber-yellow, swells to a jelly, and then dissolves to a\r\nred-brown turbid fluid. When applied to the mucous membrane of the\r\nstomach, the mucous tissue and the muscular layer beneath are coloured\r\nwhite, swell, and become an oily mass.\r\n\r\n[69] _Deutsche Klinik_, 1864, Mo. 1-32, and Vietor’s\r\n_Inaugur.-Dissert._, Marburg, 1803.\r\n\r\nWhen applied to a rabbit’s ear,[70] the parenchyma becomes at first pale\r\ngrey and semi-transparent at the back of the ear; opposite the drop of\r\nacid appear spots like grease or fat drops, which soon coalesce. The\r\nepidermis with the hair remains adherent; the blood-vessels are narrowed\r\nin calibre, and the blood, first in the veins, and then in the arteries,\r\nis coloured green and then black, and fully coagulates. If the drop,\r\nwith horizontal holding of the ear, is dried in, an inflammatory zone\r\nsurrounds the burnt spot in which the blood circulates; but there is\r\ncomplete stasis in the part to which the acid has been applied. If the\r\npoint of the ear is dipped in the acid, the cauterised part rolls\r\ninwards; after the lapse of eighteen hours the part is brown and\r\nparchment-like, with scattered points of coagulated blood; then there is\r\na slight swelling in the healthy tissues, and a small zone of redness;\r\nwithin fourteen days a bladder-like greenish-yellow scab is formed, the\r\nburnt part itself remaining dry. The vessels from the surrounding zone\r\nof redness gradually penetrate towards the cauterised spot, the fluid\r\nin the bleb becomes absorbed, and the destroyed tissues fall off in the\r\nform of a crust.\r\n\r\n[70] Samuel, _Entzündung u. Brand, in Virchow’s Archiv f. Path. Anat._,\r\nBd. 51, Hft. 1 u. 2, S. 41, 1870.\r\n\r\nThe changes that sulphuric acid cause in blood are as follows: the\r\nfibrin is at first coagulated and then dissolved, and the colouring\r\nmatter becomes of a black colour. These changes do not require the\r\nstrongest acid, being seen with an acid of 60 per cent.\r\n\r\n§ 58. The action of the acid on various non-living matters is as\r\nfollows: poured on all vegetable earth, there is an effervescence,\r\narising from decomposition of carbonates; any grass or vegetation\r\ngrowing on the spot is blackened and dies; an analysis of the layer of\r\nearth, on which the acid is poured, shows an excess of sulphates as\r\ncompared with a similar layer adjacent; the earth will only have an acid\r\nreaction, if there has been more than sufficient acid to neutralise all\r\nalkalies and alkaline earths.\r\n\r\nWood almost immediately blackens, and the spot remains moist.\r\n\r\nSpots on paper become quickly dark, and sometimes exhibit a play of\r\ncolours, such as reddish-brown; ultimately the spot becomes very black,\r\nand holes may be formed; even when the acid is dilute, the course is\r\nvery similar, for the acid dries in, until it reaches a sufficient\r\ndegree of concentration to attack the tissue. I found small drops of\r\nsulphuric acid on a brussels carpet, which had a red pattern on a dark\r\ngreen ground with light green flowers, act as follows: the spots on the\r\nred at the end of a few hours were of a dark maroon colour, the green\r\nwas darkened, and the light green browned; at the end of twenty-four\r\nhours but little change had taken place, nor could any one have guessed\r\nthe cause of the spots without a close examination. Spots of the strong\r\nacid on thin cotton fabrics rapidly blackened, and actual holes were\r\nformed in the course of an hour; the main difference to the naked eye,\r\nbetween the stains of the acid and those produced by a red-hot body, lay\r\nin the moistness of the spots. Indeed, the great distinction, without\r\nconsidering chemical evidence, between recent burns of clothing by\r\nsulphuric acid and by heat, is that in the one case--that of the\r\nacid--the hole or spot is very moist; in the other very dry. It is easy\r\nto imagine that this distinction may be of importance in a legal\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nSpots of acid on clothing fall too often under the observation of all\r\nthose engaged in practical chemical work. However quickly a spot of acid\r\nis wiped off, unless it is immediately neutralised by ammonia, it\r\nultimately makes a hole in the cloth; the spot, as a rule, whatever the\r\ncolour of the cloth, is of a blotting-paper red.\r\n\r\nSulphuric acid dropped on iron, attacks it, forming a sulphate, which\r\nmay be dissolved out by water. If the iron is exposed to the weather\r\nthe rain may wash away all traces of the acid, save the corrosion; but\r\nit would be under those circumstances impossible to say whether the\r\ncorrosion was due to oxidation or a solvent.\r\n\r\nTo sum up briefly: the characters of sulphuric acid spots on organic\r\nmatters generally are black, brown, or red-coloured destructions of\r\ntissue, moisture, acid-reaction (often after years), and lastly the\r\nchemical evidence of sulphuric acid or sulphates in excess.\r\n\r\n=Caution necessary in judging of Spots, &c.=--An important case, related\r\nby Maschka, shows the necessity of great caution in interpreting\r\nresults, unless all the circumstances of a case be carefully collated. A\r\nlive coal fell on the bed of a weakly infant, five months old. The child\r\nscreamed, and woke the father, who was dozing by the fire; the man, in\r\nterror, poured a large pot of water on the child and burning bed. The\r\nchild died the following day.\r\n\r\nA _post-mortem_ examination showed a burn on the chest of the infant 2\r\ninches in length. The tongue, pharynx, and gullet were all healthy; in\r\nthe stomach a patch of mucous membrane, about half an inch in extent,\r\nwas found to be brownish, friable, and very thin. A chemical examination\r\nshowed that the portion of the bed adjacent to the burnt place contained\r\nfree sulphuric acid. Here, then, was the following evidence: the sudden\r\ndeath of a helpless infant, a carbonised bed-cover with free sulphuric\r\nacid, and, lastly, an appearance in the stomach which, it might be said,\r\nwas not inconsistent with sulphuric acid poisoning. Yet a careful\r\nsifting of the facts convinced the judges that no crime had been\r\ncommitted, and that the child’s death was due to disease. Afterwards,\r\nexperiment showed that if a live coal fall on to any tissue, and be\r\ndrenched with water, free sulphuric acid is constantly found in the\r\nneighbourhood of the burnt place.\r\n\r\n§ 59. =Symptoms.=--The symptoms may be classed in two divisions,\r\nviz.:--1. External effects of the acid. 2. Internal effects and symptoms\r\narising from its interior administration.\r\n\r\n1. =External Effects.=--Of late years several instances have occurred in\r\nwhich the acid has been used criminally to cause disfiguring burns of\r\nthe face. The offence has in all these cases been committed by women,\r\nwho, from motives of revengeful jealousy, have suddenly dashed a\r\nquantity of the acid into the face of the object of their resentment. In\r\nsuch cases, the phenomena observed are not widely different from those\r\nattending scalds or burns from hot neutral fluids. There is destruction\r\nof tissue, not necessarily deep, for the acid is almost immediately\r\nwiped off; but if any should reach the eye, inflammation, so acute as to\r\nlead to blindness, is the probable consequence. The skin is coloured at\r\nfirst white, at a later period brown, and part of it may be, as it were,\r\ndissolved. If the tract or skin touched by the acid is extensive, death\r\nmay result. The inflammatory processes in the skin are similar to those\r\nnoticed by Falck and Vietor in their experiments, already detailed (p.\r\n79).\r\n\r\n=Internal Effects of Acids generally.=--It may not be out of place,\r\nbefore speaking of the internal effects of sulphuric acid, to make a few\r\nremarks upon the action of acids generally. This action differs\r\naccording to the kind of animal; at all events, there is a great\r\ndifference between the action of acids on the herb-eating animals and\r\nthe carnivora; the latter bear large doses of acids well, the former\r\nill. For instance, the rabbit, if given a dose of any acid not\r\nsufficient to produce local effects but sufficient to affect its\r\nfunctions, will soon become paralysed and lie in a state of stupor, as\r\nif dead; the same dose per kilo. will not affect the dog. The reason for\r\nthis is that the blood of the dog is able to neutralise the acid by\r\nammonia, and that the blood of the rabbit is destitute of this property.\r\nMan is, in this respect, nearer to the dog than to the plant-eaters.\r\nStadelmann has shown that a man is able to ingest large relative doses\r\nof oxybutyric acid, to neutralise the acid by ammonia, and to excrete it\r\nby means of the kidneys as ammonium butyrate.\r\n\r\nAcids, however, if given in doses too great to be neutralised, alike\r\naffect plant- and flesh-eaters; death follows in all cases before the\r\nblood becomes acid. Salkowsky[71] has, indeed, shown that the effect of\r\nlessening the alkalinity of the blood by giving a rabbit food from which\r\nit can extract no alkali produces a similar effect to the actual dosing\r\nwith an acid.\r\n\r\n[71] Virchow’s _Archiv_, Bd. 58, 1.\r\n\r\n2. =Internal Effects of Sulphuric Acid.=--When sulphuric acid is taken\r\ninternally, the acute and immediate symptom is pain. This, however, is\r\nnot constant, since, in a few recorded cases, no complaint of pain has\r\nbeen made; but these cases are exceptional; as a rule, there will be\r\nimmediate and great suffering. The tongue swells, the throat is also\r\nswollen and inflamed, swallowing of saliva even may be impossible. If\r\nthe acid has been in contact with the epiglottis and vocal apparatus,\r\nthere may be spasmodic croup and even fatal spasm of the glottis.\r\n\r\nThe acid, in its passage down the gullet, attacks energetically the\r\nmucous membrane and also the lining of the stomach; but the action does\r\nnot stop there, for Lesser found in eighteen out of twenty-six cases (69\r\nper cent.) that the corrosive action extended as far as the duodenum.\r\nThere is excessive vomiting and retching; the matters vomited are acid,\r\nbloody, and slimy; great pieces of mucous membrane may be in this way\r\nexpelled, and the whole of the lining membrane of the gullet may be\r\nthrown up entire. The bowels are, as a rule, constipated, but\r\nexceptionally there has been diarrhœa; the urine is sometimes retained;\r\nit invariably contains an excess of sulphates and often albumen, with\r\nhyaline casts of the uriniferous tubes. The pulse is small and frequent,\r\nthe breathing slow, the skin very cold and covered with sweat; the\r\ncountenance expresses great anxiety, and the extremities may be affected\r\nwith cramps or convulsions. Death may take place within from twenty-four\r\nto thirty-six hours, and be either preceded by dyspnœa or by\r\nconvulsions; consciousness is, as a rule, maintained to the end.\r\n\r\nThere are also more rapid cases than the above; a large dose of\r\nsulphuric acid taken on an empty stomach may absolutely dissolve it, and\r\npass into the peritoneum; in such a case there is really no difference\r\nin the symptoms between sudden perforation of the stomach from disease,\r\na penetrating wound of the abdomen, and any other sudden fatal lesion of\r\nthe organs in the abdominal cavity (for in all these instances the\r\nsymptoms are those of pure collapse); the patient is ashen pale, with\r\npulse quick and weak, and body bathed in cold sweat, and he rapidly\r\ndies, it may be without much complaint of local pain.\r\n\r\nIf the patient live longer than twenty-four hours, the symptoms are\r\nmainly those of inflammation of the whole mucous tract, from the mouth\r\nto the stomach; and from this inflammation the patient may die in a\r\nvariable period, of from three to eleven days, after taking the poison.\r\nIn one case the death occurred suddenly, without any immediately\r\npreceding symptoms rendering imminent death probable. If this second\r\nstage is passed, then the loss of substance in the gullet and in the\r\nstomach almost invariably causes impairment of function, leading to a\r\nslow and painful death. The common sequence is stricture of the gullet,\r\ncombined with feeble digestion, and in a few instances stricture of the\r\npylorus. A curious sequel has been recorded by Mannkopf, viz., obstinate\r\nintercostal neuralgia; it has been observed on the fourth, seventh, and\r\ntwenty-second day.\r\n\r\n§ 60. =Treatment of Acute Poisoning by the Mineral Acids.=--The\r\nimmediate indication is the dilution and neutralisation of the acid. For\r\nthis purpose, finely-divided chalk, magnesia, or sodic carbonate may be\r\nused, dissolved or suspended in much water. The use of the stomach-pump\r\nis inadvisable, for the mucous membrane of the gullet may be so corroded\r\nby the acid that the passage of the tube down will do injury; unless the\r\nneutralisation is _immediate_, but little good is effected; hence it\r\nwill often occur that the bystanders, if at all conversant with the\r\nmatter, will have to use the first thing which comes to hand, such as\r\nthe plaster of a wall, &c.; and lastly, if even these rough antidotes\r\nare not to be had, the best treatment is enormous doses of water, which\r\nwill dilute the acid and promote vomiting. The treatment of the\r\nafter-effects belongs to the province of ordinary medicine, and is based\r\nupon general principles.\r\n\r\n§ 61. =Post-mortem Appearances.=[72]--The general pathological\r\nappearances to be found in the stomach and internal organs differ\r\naccording as the death is rapid or slow; if the death takes place within\r\ntwenty-four hours, the effects are fairly uniform, the differences being\r\nonly in degree; while, on the other hand, in those cases which terminate\r\nfatally from the more remote effects of the acid, there is some variety.\r\nIt may be well to select two actual cases as types, the one patient\r\ndying from acute poisoning, the other surviving for a time, and then\r\ndying from ulceration and contraction of the digestive tract.\r\n\r\n[72] It has been observed that putrefaction in cases of death from\r\nsulphuric acid is slow. Casper suggests this may be due to the\r\nneutralisation of ammonia; more probably it is owing to the antiseptic\r\nproperties all mineral acids possess.\r\n\r\nA hatter, early in the morning, swallowed a large mouthful of strong\r\nsulphuric acid, a preparation which he used in his work--(whether the\r\ndraught was taken accidentally or suicidally was never known). He died\r\nwithin two hours. The whole tongue was sphacelated, parts of the mucous\r\nmembrane being dissolved; the inner surface of the gullet, as well as\r\nthe whole throat, was of a grey-black colour; the mucous membrane of the\r\nstomach was coal-black, and so softened that it gave way like\r\nblotting-paper under the forceps, the contents escaping into the cavity\r\nof the abdomen. The peritoneum was also blackened as if burnt; probably\r\nthere had been perforation of the stomach during life; the mucous\r\nmembrane of the duodenum was swollen, hardened, and looked as if it had\r\nbeen boiled; while the blood was of a cherry-red colour, and of the\r\nconsistence of a thin syrup. The rest of the organs were healthy; a\r\nchemical research on the fluid which had been collected from the\r\nstomach, gullet, and duodenum showed that it contained 87·25 grains of\r\nfree sulphuric acid.[73]\r\n\r\n[73] Casper, vol. ii. case 194.\r\n\r\nThis is, perhaps, the most extreme case of destruction on record; the\r\ncause of the unusually violent action is referable to the acid acting on\r\nan empty stomach. It is important to note that even with this extensive\r\ndestruction of the stomach, life was prolonged for two hours.\r\n\r\nThe case I have selected to serve as a type of a chronic but fatal\r\nillness produced from poisoning by sulphuric acid is one related by\r\nOscar Wyss. A cook, thirty-four years of age, who had suffered many\r\nailments, drank, on the 6th of November 1867, by mistake, at eight\r\no’clock in the morning, two mouthfuls of a mixture of 1 part of\r\nsulphuric acid and 4 of water. Pain in the stomach and neck, and\r\nvomiting of black masses, were the immediate symptoms, and two hours\r\nlater he was admitted into the hospital in a state of collapse, with\r\ncold extremities, cyanosis of the face, &c. Copious draughts of milk\r\nwere given, and the patient vomited much, the vomit still consisting of\r\nblack pultaceous matters, in which, on a microscopical examination,\r\ncould be readily detected columnar epithelium of the stomach and mucous\r\ntissue elements. The urine was of specific gravity 1·033,\r\nnon-albuminous; on analysis it contained 3·388 grms. of combined\r\nsulphuric acid.\r\n\r\nOn the second day there was some improvement in the symptoms; the urine\r\ncontained 1·276 grm. of combined sulphuric acid; on the third day 2·665\r\ngrms. of combined sulphuric acid; and on the tenth day the patient\r\nvomited up a complete cast of the mucous membrane of the gullet. The\r\npatient remained in the hospital, and became gradually weaker from\r\nstricture of the gullet and impairment of the digestive powers, and\r\ndied, two months after taking the poison, on the 5th of January 1868.\r\n\r\nThe stomach was found small, contracted, with many adhesions to the\r\npancreas and liver; it was about 12 centimetres long (4·7 inches), and\r\nfrom 2 to 2·5 centimetres (·7 to ·9 inch) broad, contracted to somewhat\r\nthe form of a cat’s intestine; there were several transverse rugæ; the\r\nwalls were thickened at the small curvature, measurements giving 5 mm.\r\n(·19 inch) in the middle, and beyond about 2·75 mm. (·11 inch); in the\r\nupper two-thirds the lumen was so contracted as scarcely to admit the\r\npoint of the little finger. The inner surface was covered with a layer\r\nof pus, with no trace of mucous tissue, and was everywhere pale red,\r\nuneven, and crossed by cicatricial bands. In two parts, at the greater\r\ncurvature, the mucous surface was strongly injected in a ring-like form,\r\nand in the middle of the ring was a deep funnel-shaped ulcer; a part of\r\nthe rest of the stomach was strongly injected and scattered over with\r\nnumerous punctiform, small, transparent bladders. The gullet was\r\ncontracted at the upper part (just below the epiglottis) from 20 to 22\r\nmm. (·78 to ·86 inch) in diameter; it then gradually widened to measure\r\nabout 12 mm. (·47 inch) at the diaphragm; in the neighbourhood of the\r\nlast contraction the tissue was scarred, injected, and ulcerated; there\r\nwere also small abscesses opening into this portion of the gullet.\r\n\r\nE. Fraenkel and F. Reiche[74] have studied the effects of sulphuric acid\r\non the kidney. In rapid cases they find a wide-spread coagulation of the\r\nepithelium in the convoluted and straight urinary canaliculi, with\r\ndestruction of the kidney parenchyma, but no inflammation.\r\n\r\n[74] Virchow’s _Archiv_, Bd. 131, f. 130.\r\n\r\n§ 62. The museums of the different London hospitals afford excellent\r\nmaterial for the study of the effects of sulphuric acid on the pharynx,\r\ngullet, and stomach; and it may be a matter of convenience to students\r\nif the more typical examples at these different museums be noticed in\r\ndetail, so that the preparations themselves may be referred to.\r\n\r\n    _In St. Bartholomew’s Museum_, No. 1942, is an example of excessive\r\n    destruction of the stomach by sulphuric acid. The stomach is much\r\n    contracted, and has a large aperture with ragged edges; the mucous\r\n    membrane is thickened, charred, and blackened.\r\n\r\n    No. 1941, in the same museum, is the stomach of a person who died\r\n    from a large dose of sulphuric acid. When recent, it is described as\r\n    of a deep red colour, mottled with black; appearances which, from\r\n    long soaking in spirit, are not true at the present time; but the\r\n    rough, shaggy state of the mucous tissue can be traced; the gullet\r\n    and the pylorus appear the least affected.\r\n\r\n    _St. George’s Hospital_, ser. ix., 146, 11 and 43, e.--The pharynx\r\n    and œsophagus of a man who was brought into the hospital in a state\r\n    of collapse, after a large but unknown dose of sulphuric acid. The\r\n    lips were much eroded, the mucous membrane of the stomach, pharynx,\r\n    and œsophagus show an extraordinary shreddy condition; the lining\r\n    membrane of the stomach is much charred, and the action has extended\r\n    to the duodenum; the muscular coat is not affected.\r\n\r\n    _Guy’s Hospital_, No. 1799.--A preparation showing the mucous\r\n    membrane of the stomach entirely denuded. The organ looks like a\r\n    piece of thin paper.\r\n\r\n    No. 1799²⁰. The stomach of a woman who poisoned herself by drinking\r\n    a wine-glassful of acid before breakfast. She lived eleven days. The\r\n    main symptoms were vomiting and purging, but there was no complaint\r\n    of pain. There is extensive destruction of mucous membrane along the\r\n    lesser curvature and towards the pyloric extremity; a portion of the\r\n    mucous membrane is floating as a slough.\r\n\r\n    No. 1799²⁵ is the gullet and stomach of a man who took about 3\r\n    drachms of the strong acid. He lived three days without much\r\n    apparent suffering, and died unexpectedly. The lining membrane of\r\n    the œsophagus has the longitudinal wrinkles or furrows so often,\r\n    nay, almost constantly, met with in poisoning by the acids. The\r\n    mucous tissue of the stomach is raised in cloudy ridges, and\r\n    blackened.\r\n\r\n    No. 1799³⁵ is a wonderfully entire cast of the gullet from a woman\r\n    who swallowed an ounce of sulphuric acid, and is said, according to\r\n    the catalogue, to have recovered.\r\n\r\n    _University College._--In this museum will be found an exquisite\r\n    preparation of the effects of sulphuric acid. The mucous membrane of\r\n    the œsophagus is divided into small quadrilateral areas by\r\n    longitudinal and transverse furrows; the stomach is very brown, and\r\n    covered with shreddy and filamentous tissue; the brown colour is\r\n    without doubt the remains of extravasated and charred blood.\r\n\r\n    No. 6201 is a wax cast representing the stomach of a woman who died\r\n    after taking a large dose of sulphuric acid. A yellow mass was found\r\n    in the stomach; there are two perforations, and the mucous membrane\r\n    is entirely destroyed.\r\n\r\n§ 63. =Chronic Poisoning by Sulphuric Acid.=--Weiske[75] has\r\nexperimentally proved that lambs, given for six months small doses of\r\nsulphuric acid, grow thin, and their bones, with the exception of the\r\nbones of the head and the long bones, are poor in lime salts, the\r\nmuscles also are poor in the same constituents. Kobert[76] thinks that\r\ndrunkards on the continent addicted to “Schnaps,” commonly a liquid\r\nacidified with sulphuric acid to give it a sharp taste, often show\r\ntypical chronic sulphuric acid poisoning.\r\n\r\n[75] H. Weiske, _Journ. f. Landwirthsch._, 1887, 417.\r\n\r\n[76] _Lehrbuch der Intoxicationen_, S. 210.\r\n\r\n\r\nDetection and Estimation of Free Sulphuric Acid.\r\n\r\n§ 64. The general method of separating the mineral acids is as follows:\r\nthe tissues, or matters, are soaked in distilled water for some time. If\r\nno free acid is present, the liquid will not redden litmus-paper, or\r\ngive an acid reaction with any of the numerous tinctorial agents in use\r\nby the chemist for the purposes of titration. After sufficient digestion\r\nin water, the liquid extract is made up to some definite bulk and\r\nallowed to subside. Filtration is unnecessary. A small fractional part\r\n(say, for example, should the whole be 250 c.c., 1/100th or 2·5 c.c.) is\r\ntaken, and using as an indicator cochineal or phenolphthalein, the total\r\nacidity is estimated by a decinormal solution of soda. By this\r\npreliminary operation, some guide for the conduct of the future more\r\nexact operations is obtained. Should the liquid be very acid, a small\r\nquantity of the whole is to be now taken, but if the acidity is feeble,\r\na larger quantity is necessary, and sufficient quinine then added to fix\r\nthe acid--100 parts of sulphuric acid are saturated by 342 parts of\r\nquinine monohydrate. Therefore, on the supposition that all the free\r\nacid is sulphuric, it will be found sufficient to add 3·5 parts of\r\nquinine for every 1 part of acid, estimated as sulphuric, found by the\r\npreliminary rough titration; and as it is inconvenient to deal with\r\nlarge quantities of alkaloid, a fractional portion of the liquid extract\r\n(representing not more than 50 mgrms. of acid) should be taken, which\r\nwill require 175 mgrms. of quinine.\r\n\r\nOn addition of the quinine, the neutralised liquid is evaporated to\r\ndryness, or to approaching dryness, and then exhausted by strong\r\nalcohol. The alcoholic extract is, after filtration, dried up, and the\r\nquinine sulphate, nitrate, or hydrochlorate, as the case may be,\r\nfiltered off and extracted by boiling water, and precipitated by\r\nammonia, the end result being quinine hydrate (which may be filtered off\r\nand used again for similar purposes) and a sulphate, nitrate or chloride\r\nof ammonia in solution. It therefore remains to determine the nature and\r\nquantity of the acids now combined with ammonia. The solution is made up\r\nto a known bulk, and portions tested for chlorides by nitrate of silver,\r\nand for nitrates by the copper or the ferrous sulphate test. If\r\nsulphuric acid is present, there will be a precipitate of barium\r\nsulphate, which, on account of its density and insolubility in nitric or\r\nhydrochloric acids, is very characteristic. For estimating the sulphuric\r\nacid thus found, it will only be necessary to take a known bulk of the\r\nsame liquid, heat it to boiling after acidifying by hydrochloric acid,\r\nand then add a sufficient quantity of baric chloride solution. Unless\r\nthis exact process is followed, the analyst is likely to get a liquid\r\nwhich refuses to filter clear, but if the sulphate be precipitated from\r\na hot liquid, it usually settles rapidly to the bottom of the vessel,\r\nand the supernatant fluid can be decanted clear; the precipitate is\r\nwashed by decantation, and ultimately collected on a filter, dried, and\r\nweighed.\r\n\r\nThe sulphate of baryta found, multiplied by ·3434, equals the sulphuric\r\nanhydride.\r\n\r\nThe older process was to dissolve the free sulphuric acid out by\r\nalcohol. As is well known, mineral sulphates are insoluble in, and are\r\nprecipitated by, alcohol, whereas sulphuric acid enters into solution.\r\nThe most valid objection, as a quantitative process, to the use of\r\nalcohol, is the tendency which all mineral acids have to unite with\r\nalcohol in organic combination, and thus, as it were, to disappear; and,\r\nindeed, results are found, by experiment, to be below the truth when\r\nalcohol is used. This objection does not hold good if either merely\r\nqualitative evidence, or a fairly approximate quantation, is required.\r\nIn such a case, the vomited matters, the contents of the stomach, or a\r\nwatery extract of the tissues, are evaporated to a syrup, and then\r\nextracted with strong alcohol and filtered; a little phenolphthalein\r\nsolution is added, and the acid alcohol exactly neutralised by an\r\nalcoholic solution of clear decinormal or normal soda. According to the\r\nacidity of the liquid, the amount used of the decinormal or normal soda\r\nis noted, and then the whole evaporated to dryness, and finally heated\r\nto gentle redness. The alkaline sulphate is next dissolved in very\r\ndilute hydrochloric acid, and the solution precipitated by chloride of\r\nbarium in the usual way. The quantitative results, although low, would,\r\nin the great majority of cases, answer the purpose sufficiently.\r\n\r\nA test usually enumerated, Hilger’s test for mineral acid, may be\r\nmentioned. A liquid, which contains a very minute quantity of mineral\r\nacid, becomes of a blue colour (or, if 1 per cent. or above, of a green)\r\non the addition of a solution of methyl aniline violet; but this test,\r\nalthough useful in examining vinegars (see “Foods,” p. 519), is not of\r\nmuch value in toxicology, and the quinine method for this purpose meets\r\nevery conceivable case, both for qualitative and quantitative purposes.\r\n\r\n§ 65. =The Urine.=--Although an excess of sulphates is found constantly\r\nin the urine of persons who have taken large doses of sulphuric acid,\r\nthe latter has never been found in that liquid in a free state, so that\r\nit will be useless to search for free acid. It is, therefore, only\r\nnecessary to add HCl to filter the fluid, and precipitate direct with an\r\nexcess of chloride of barium. It is better to operate in this manner\r\nthan to burn the urine to an ash, for in the latter case part of the\r\nsulphates, in the presence of phosphates, are decomposed, and, on the\r\nother hand, any organic sulphur combinations are liable to be estimated\r\nas sulphates.\r\n\r\nIt may also be well to pass chlorine gas through the same urine which\r\nhas been treated with chloride of barium, and from which the sulphate\r\nhas been filtered off. The result of this treatment will be a second\r\nprecipitate of sulphate derived from sulphur, in a different form of\r\ncombination than that of sulphate.\r\n\r\nThe greatest amount of sulphuric acid as mineral and organic sulphate is\r\nseparated, according to Mannkopf[77] and Schultzen,[78] within five\r\nhours after taking sulphuric acid; after three days the secretion, so\r\nfar as total sulphates is concerned, is normal.\r\n\r\n[77] “Toxicologie der Schwefelsäure,” _Wiener med. Wochen._, 1862, 1863.\r\n\r\n[78] _Archiv. f. Anatom. u. Physiol._, 1864.\r\n\r\nThe normal amount of sulphuric acid excreted daily, according to\r\nThudichum, is from 1·5 to 2·5 grms., and organic sulphur up to ·2 grm.\r\nin the twenty-four hours, but very much more has been excreted by\r\nhealthy persons.\r\n\r\nLehmann made some observations on himself, and found that, on an animal\r\ndiet, he excreted no less than 10·399 grms. of sulphuric acid per day,\r\nwhile on mixed food a little over 7 grms.; but, as Thudichum justly\r\nobserves, this great amount must be referred to individual peculiarity.\r\nThe amount of sulphates has a decided relation to diet. Animal food,\r\nalthough not containing sulphates, yet, from the oxidation of the\r\nsulphur-holding albumen, produces a urine rich in sulphate. Thus Vogel\r\nfound that a person, whose daily average was 2·02 grms., yielded 7·3 on\r\na meat diet. The internal use of sulphur, sulphides, and sulphates,\r\ngiven in an ordinary medicinal way, is traceable in the urine,\r\nincreasing the sulphates. In chronic diseases the amount of sulphates is\r\ndecreased, in acute increased.\r\n\r\nFinally, it would appear that the determination of sulphates in the\r\nurine is not of much value, _save when the normal amount that the\r\nindividual secretes is primarily known_. On the other hand, a low amount\r\nof sulphates in the urine of a person poisoned by sulphuric acid has not\r\nbeen observed within three days of the taking of the poison, and one can\r\nimagine cases in which such a low result might have forensic importance.\r\n\r\nThe presence of albumen in the urine has been considered by some a\r\nconstant result of sulphuric acid poisoning, but although when looked\r\nfor it is usually found, it cannot be considered constant. O.\r\nSmoler,[79] in eighteen cases of various degrees of sulphuric acid\r\npoisoning, found nothing abnormal in the urine. Wyss[80] found in the\r\nlater stages of a case indican and pus. E. Leyden and Ph. Munn[81]\r\nalways found blood in the urine, as well as albumen, with casts and\r\ncellular elements. Mannkopf[82] found albuminuria in three cases out of\r\nfive; in two of the cases there were fibrinous casts; in two the albumen\r\ndisappeared at the end of the second or third day, but in one it\r\ncontinued for more than twenty days. Bamberger[83] has observed an\r\nincreased albuminuria, with separation of the colouring matter of the\r\nblood. In this case it was ascribed to the action of the acid on the\r\nblood.\r\n\r\n[79] _Archiv der Heilkunde red. v._ E.

Again,\r\nCasper’s case, No. 200, is that of a young woman, aged 19, who died from\r\na poisonous dose of sulphuric acid. At the autopsy, four days after\r\ndeath, the following peculiarities of the blood were thus noted:--“The\r\nblood had an acid reaction, was dark, and had (as is usual in these\r\ncases) a syrupy consistence, while the blood-corpuscles were quite\r\nunchanged. The blood was treated with an excess of absolute alcohol,\r\nfiltered, the filtrate concentrated on a water-bath, the residue\r\nexhausted with absolute alcohol, &c. It yielded a small quantity of\r\nsulphuric acid.”\r\n\r\nOther similar cases might be noted, but it must not for a moment be\r\nsupposed that the mass of the blood contains any free sulphuric acid\r\nduring life. The acidity of the blood in the vena cava may be ascribed\r\nto _post-mortem_ endosmosis, the acid passing through the walls of the\r\nstomach into the large vessel.\r\n\r\n§ 67. =Sulphates.=--If the acid swallowed should have been entirely\r\nneutralised by antidotes, such as chalk, &c., it becomes of the first\r\nimportance to ascertain, as far as possible, by means of a microscopical\r\nexamination, the nature of the food remaining in the stomach, and then\r\nto calculate the probable contents in sulphates of the food thus known\r\nto be eaten. It will be found that, with ordinary food, and under\r\nordinary circumstances, only small percentages of combined sulphuric\r\nacid can be present.\r\n\r\nAs an example, take the ordinary rations of the soldier, viz.:--12 oz.\r\nof meat, 24 oz. of bread, 16 oz. of potatoes, 8 oz. of other vegetables;\r\nwith sugar, salt, tea, coffee, and water. Now, if the whole quantity of\r\nthese substances were eaten at a meal, they would not contain more than\r\nfrom 8 to 10 grains (·5 to ·6 grm.) of anhydrous sulphuric acid, in the\r\nform of sulphates.\r\n\r\nSo far as the contents of the stomach are concerned, we have only to do\r\nwith sulphates introduced in the food, but when once the food passes\r\nfurther along the intestinal canal, circumstances are altered, for we\r\nhave sulphur-holding secretions, which, with ordinary chemical methods,\r\nyield sulphuric acid. Thus, even in the newly-born infant, according to\r\nthe analyses of Zweifler, the mineral constituents of meconium are\r\nespecially sulphate of lime, with a smaller quantity of sulphate of\r\npotash. The amount of bile which flows into the whole tract of the\r\nintestinal canal is estimated at about half a litre in the twenty-four\r\nhours; the amount of sulphur found in bile varies from ·89 to 3 per\r\ncent., so that in 500 c.c. we might, by oxidising the sulphur, obtain\r\nfrom 2·2 to 7·5 grms. of sulphuric anhydride.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore certain that large quantities of organic\r\nsulphur-compounds may be found in the human intestinal canal, for with\r\nindividuals who suffer from constipation, the residues of the biliary\r\nsecretion accumulate for many days. Hence, if the analyst searches for\r\nsulphates in excretal matters, all methods involving destruction of\r\norganic substances, whether by fire or by fluid-oxidising agents, are\r\nwrong in principle, and there is nothing left save to separate soluble\r\nsulphates by dialysis, or to precipitate direct out of an aqueous\r\nextract.\r\n\r\nAgain, sulphate of magnesia is a common medicine, and so is sodic\r\nsulphate; a possible medicinal dose of magnesia sulphate might amount to\r\n56·7 grms. (2 oz.), the more usual dose being half that quantity.\r\nLastly, among the insane there are found patients who will eat\r\nplaster-of-Paris, earth, and similar matters, so that, in special cases,\r\na very large amount of combined sulphuric acid may be found in the\r\nintestinal tract, without any relation to poisoning by the free acid;\r\nbut in such instances it must be rare, indeed, that surrounding\r\ncircumstances or pathological evidence will not give a clue to the real\r\nstate of affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--Hydrochloric Acid.\r\n\r\n§ 68. _General Properties._--Hydrochloric acid, otherwise called\r\n_muriatic acid_, _spirit of salt_, is, in a strictly chemical sense, a\r\npure gas, composed of 97·26 per cent. of chlorine, and 2·74 per cent. of\r\nhydrogen; but, in an ordinary sense, it is a liquid, being a solution of\r\nthe gas itself.\r\n\r\nHydrochloric acid is made on an enormous scale in the United Kingdom,\r\nthe production being estimated at about a million tons annually.\r\n\r\nThe toxicology of hydrochloric acid is modern, for we have no evidence\r\nthat anything was known of it prior to the middle of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, when Glauber prepared it in solution, and, in 1772, Priestley,\r\nby treating common salt with sulphuric acid, isolated the pure gas.\r\n\r\nThe common liquid hydrochloric acid of commerce has a specific gravity\r\nof from 1·15 to 1·20, and contains usually less than 40 parts of\r\nhydrochloric acid in the 100 parts. The strength of pure samples of\r\nhydrochloric acid can be told by the specific gravity, and a very close\r\napproximation, in default of tables, may be obtained by simply\r\nmultiplying the decimal figures of the specific gravity by 200. For\r\nexample, an acid of 1·20 gravity would by this rule contain 40 per cent.\r\nof real acid, for ·20 × 200 = 40.\r\n\r\nThe commercial acid is nearly always a little yellow, from the presence\r\nof iron derived from metallic retorts, and usually contains small\r\nquantities of chloride of arsenic,[84] derived from the sulphuric acid;\r\nbut the colourless hydrochloric acid specially made for laboratory and\r\nmedicinal use is nearly always pure.\r\n\r\n[84] Some samples of hydrochloric acid have been found to contain as\r\nmuch as 4 per cent. of chloride of arsenic, but this is very unusual.\r\nGlenard found as a mean 2·5 grammes, As₂O₃ per kilogramme.\r\n\r\nThe uses of the liquid acid are mainly in the production of chlorine, as\r\na solvent for metals, and for medicinal and chemical purposes. Its\r\nproperties are briefly as follows:--\r\n\r\nIt is a colourless or faintly-yellow acid liquid, the depth of colour\r\ndepending on its purity, and especially its freedom from iron. The\r\nliquid is volatile, and can be separated from fixed matters and the less\r\nvolatile acids by distillation; it has a strong attraction for water,\r\nand fumes when exposed to the air, from becoming saturated with aqueous\r\nvapour. If exposed to the vapour of ammonia, extremely dense clouds\r\narise, due to the formation of the solid ammonium chloride. The acid,\r\nboiled with a small quantity of manganese binoxide, evolves chlorine.\r\nDioxide of lead has a similar action; the chlorine may be detected by\r\nits bleaching action on a piece of paper dipped in indigo blue; a little\r\nzinc foil immersed in the acid disengages hydrogen. These two\r\ntests--viz., the production of chlorine by the one, and the production\r\nof hydrogen by the other--separate and reveal the constituent parts of\r\nthe acid. Hydrochloric acid, in common with chlorides, gives a dense\r\nprecipitate with silver nitrate. The precipitate is insoluble in nitric\r\nacid, but soluble in ammonia; it melts without decomposition. Exposed to\r\nthe light, it becomes of a purple or blackish colour. Every 100 parts of\r\nsilver chloride are equal to 25·43 of hydrochloric acid, HCl, and to\r\n63·5 parts of the liquid acid of specific gravity 1·20.\r\n\r\nThe properties of pure hydrochloric acid gas are as follows:--Specific\r\ngravity 1·262, consisting of equal volumes of hydrogen and chlorine,\r\nunited without condensation. 100 cubic inches must therefore have a\r\nweight of 39·36 grains. The gas was liquefied by Faraday by means of a\r\npressure of 40 atmospheres at 10°; it was colourless, and had a less\r\nrefractive index than water.\r\n\r\nWater absorbs the gas with avidity, 100 volumes of water absorbing\r\n48,000 volumes of the gas, and becoming 142 volumes. The solution has\r\nall the properties of strong hydrochloric acid, specific gravity 1·21.\r\nThe dilute hydrochloric acid of the Pharmacopœia should have a specific\r\ngravity of 1·052, and be equivalent to 10·58 per cent. of HCl.\r\n\r\n§69. =Statistics of Poisoning by Hydrochloric Acid.=--The following\r\ntables give the deaths, with age and sex distribution, due to\r\nhydrochloric acid for ten years (1883-92):--\r\n\r\nDEATHS FROM HYDROCHLORIC ACID IN ENGLAND AND WALES DURING THE TEN YEARS\r\nENDING 1892.\r\n\r\n                        ACCIDENT OR NEGLIGENCE.\r\n\r\n  Ages,     Under   1-5   5-15   15-25   25-65   65 and    Total\r\n              1                                  above\r\n  Males,       1    16      2      ...     26       3        48\r\n  Females,   ...     8    ...      ...      9       1        18\r\n            ----------------------------------------------------\r\n  Totals,      1    24      2      ...     35       4        66\r\n            ----------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                               SUICIDE.\r\n\r\n  Ages,                   5-15   15-25   25-65   65 and    Total\r\n                                                 above\r\n  Males,                  ...       2      73       8        83\r\n  Females,                  1       8      42      65       116\r\n                         ---------------------------------------\r\n  Totals,                   1      10     115      73       199\r\n                         ---------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIn 1889 a solitary case of the murder of a child is on record from\r\nhydrochloric acid; hence, with that addition, the total deaths from\r\nhydrochloric acid amount to 266 in the ten years, or about 26 a year.\r\n\r\n§ 70. =Fatal Dose.=--The dose which destroys life is not known with any\r\naccuracy. In two cases, adults have been killed by 14 grms. (half an\r\nounce) of the commercial acid; but, on the other hand, recovery is\r\nrecorded when more than double this quantity has been taken. A girl,\r\nfifteen years of age, died from drinking a teaspoonful of the acid.[85]\r\n\r\n[85] _Brit. Med. Journ._, March, 1871.\r\n\r\n§ 71. =Amount of Free Acid in the Gastric Juice.=--Hydrochloric acid\r\nexists in the gastric juice. This was first ascertained by Prout[86] in\r\n1824; he separated it by distillation. The observation was afterwards\r\nconfirmed by Gmelin,[87] Children,[88] and Braconnot.[89] On the other\r\nhand, Lehmann[90] pointed out that, as the stomach secretion contained,\r\nwithout doubt, lactic acid, the act of distillation, in the presence of\r\nthis lactic acid, would set free hydrochloric acid from any alkaline\r\nchlorides. Blondlot and Cl. Bernard also showed that the gastric juice\r\npossessed no acid which would dissolve oxalate of lime, or develop\r\nhydrogen when treated with iron filings; hence there could not be free\r\nhydrochloric acid which, even in a diluted state, would respond to both\r\nthese tests. Then followed the researches of C. Schmidt,[91] who showed\r\nthat the gastric secretion of men, of sheep, and of dogs contained more\r\nhydrochloric acid than would satisfy the bases present; and he\r\npropounded the view that the gastric juice does not contain absolutely\r\nfree hydrochloric acid, but that it is in loose combination with the\r\npepsin.\r\n\r\n[86] _Philosophical Transactions_, 1824, p. 45.\r\n\r\n[87] P. Tiedmann and L. Gmelin, _Die Verdauung nach Versuchen_,\r\nHeidelberg u.

Schmidt, _Verdauungs-Säfte_, &c.\r\n\r\nThe amount of acid in the stomach varies from moment to moment, and\r\ntherefore it is not possible to say what the average acidity of gastric\r\njuice is. It has been shown that in the total absence of _free_\r\nhydrochloric acid digestion may take place, because hydrochloric acid\r\nforms a compound with pepsin which acts as a solvent on the food. The\r\namount of physiologically active acid varies with the food taken. It is\r\nsmallest when carbohydrates are consumed, greatest with meat. The\r\nmaximum amount that Jaksch found in his researches, when meat was\r\ningested, was ·09 per cent. of hydrochloric acid. It is probable that\r\nanything above 0·2 per cent. of hydrochloric acid is either abnormal or\r\nowing to the recent ingestion of hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\n§ 72. =Influence of Hydrochloric Acid on Vegetation.=--Hydrochloric acid\r\nfumes, if emitted from works on a large scale, injure vegetation much.\r\nIn former years, before any legal obligations were placed upon\r\nmanufacturers for the condensing of the volatile products, the nuisance\r\nfrom this cause was great. In 1823, the duty on salt being repealed by\r\nthe Government, an extraordinary impetus was given to the manufacture of\r\nhydrochloric acid, and since all the volatile products at that time\r\nescaped through short chimneys into the air, a considerable area of land\r\nround the works was rendered quite unfit for growing plants. The present\r\nlaw on the subject is, that the maximum quantity of acid escaping shall\r\nnot exceed 2 grains per cubic foot of the air, smoke, or chimney gases;\r\nand, according to the reports of the alkali inspectors, the condensation\r\nby the improved appliances is well within the Act, and about as perfect\r\nas can be devised.\r\n\r\nIt appears from the reports of the Belgian Commission in 1855, when\r\nvirtually no precautions were taken, that the gases are liable to injure\r\nvegetation to the extent of 2000 metres (2187 yards) around any active\r\nworks; the more watery vapour the air contains, the quicker is the gas\r\nprecipitated and carried to the earth. If the action of the vapour is\r\nconsiderable, the leaves of plants dry and wither; the chlorophyll\r\nbecomes modified, and no longer gives the normal spectrum, while a\r\nthickening of the rind of trees has also been noticed. The cereals\r\nsuffer much; they increase in stalk, but produce little grain. The\r\nleguminosæ become spotted, and have an air of dryness and want of\r\nvigour; while the potato, among plants utilised for food, appears to\r\nhave the strongest resistance. Vines are very sensitive to the gas.\r\nAmong trees, the alder seems most sensitive; then come fruit-trees, and\r\nlast, the hardy forest-trees--the poplar, the ash, the lime, the elm,\r\nthe maple, the birch, and the oak.[92]\r\n\r\n[92] Those who desire to study more closely the effect of acids\r\ngenerally on vegetation may consult the various papers of the alkali\r\ninspectors contained in the Local Government Reports.

S. 404, 1872.\r\n\r\n§73. =Action upon Cloth and Manufactured Articles.=--On black cloth the\r\nacid produces a green stain, which is not moist and shows no corrosion.\r\nOn most matters the stain is more or less reddish; after a little time\r\nno free acid may be detected, by simply moistening the spot; but if the\r\nstain is cut out and boiled with water, there may be some evidence of\r\nfree acid. The absence of moisture and corrosion distinguishes the stain\r\nfrom that produced by sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\n§74. =Poisonous Effects of Hydrochloric Acid Gas.=--Eulenberg[93] has\r\nstudied the effects of the vapour of this acid on rabbits and pigeons.\r\nOne of these experiments may be cited in detail. Hydrochloric acid gas,\r\nprepared by heating together common salt and sulphuric acid, was passed\r\ninto a glass shade supported on a plate, and a rabbit was placed in the\r\ntransparent chamber thus formed. On the entrance of the vapour, there\r\nwas immediate blinking of the eyes, rubbing of the paws against the\r\nnostrils, and emission of white fumes with the expired breath, while the\r\nrespiration was irregular (40 to the minute). After the lapse of ten\r\nminutes, the gas was again introduced, until the atmosphere was quite\r\nthick; the symptoms were similar to those detailed above, but more\r\nviolent; and in fourteen minutes from the commencement, the rabbit sank\r\ndown on its right side (respirations 32). When twenty-two minutes had\r\nelapsed, the gas was again allowed to enter. The rabbit now lay quiet,\r\nwith closed eyes and laboured respiration, and, finally, after\r\nhalf-an-hour of intermittent exposure to the gas, the animal was\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\n[93] _Gewerbe Hygiene_, Berlin, 1876, S. 51.\r\n\r\nThe cornea were opalescent, and the eyes filled with water; there was\r\nfrequent shaking of the head and working of the forepaws. After three\r\nminutes’ exposure to the air, the respirations were found to be 128 per\r\nminute; this quickened respiration lasted for an hour, then gave place\r\nto a shorter and more superficial breathing. On the second day after the\r\nexperiment, the rabbit suffered from laboured respiration (28 to the\r\nminute) and pain, and there was a rattling in the bronchial tubes. The\r\nanimal died on the third day, death being preceded by slow respiration\r\n(12 to the minute).\r\n\r\nThe appearances twenty-four hours after death were as follows:--The eyes\r\nwere coated with a thick slime, and both cornea were opalescent; there\r\nwas strong rigidity of the body. The pia mater covering the brain was\r\neverywhere hyperæmic, and at the hinder border of both hemispheres\r\nappeared a small clot, surrounded by a thin layer of bloody fluid. The\r\n_plex. venos spin._ was filled with coagulated blood, and there was also\r\na thin extravasation of blood covering the medulla and pons. The lungs\r\nwere mottled bright brown-red; the middle lobe of the right lung was\r\ndark brown, solid, and sank in water; the lower lobe of the same lung\r\nand the upper lobe of the left lung were nearly in a similar condition,\r\nbut the edges were of a bright red. The parenchyma in the darker places\r\non section did not crepitate. On the cut surface was a little dark,\r\nfluid, weakly-acid blood; the tracheal mucous membrane was injected. The\r\nheart was filled with thick coagulated blood; the liver was congested,\r\nof a reddish-brown colour, and rich in dark, fluid blood: in the vena\r\ncava inferior was coagulated blood. The kidneys were not hyperæmic; the\r\nintestines were superficially congested.\r\n\r\nI think there can be little doubt that the symptoms during life, and the\r\nappearances after death, in this case are perfectly consistent with the\r\nfollowing view:--The vapour acts first as a direct irritant, and is\r\ncapable of exciting inflammation in the lung and bronchial tissues; but\r\nbesides this, there is a secondary effect, only occurring when the gas\r\nis in sufficient quantity, and the action sufficiently prolonged--viz.,\r\na direct coagulation of the blood in certain points of the living\r\nvessels of the lungs. The consequence of this is a more or less general\r\nbackward engorgement, the right side of the heart becomes distended with\r\nblood, and the ultimate cause of death is partly mechanical. The\r\nhyperæmia of the brain membranes, and even the hæmorrhages, are quite\r\nconsistent with this view, and occur in cases where the obstruction to\r\nthe circulation is of a coarser and more obvious character, and can\r\ntherefore be better appreciated.\r\n\r\n§ 75. =Effects of the Liquid Acid.=--There is one distinction between\r\npoisoning by hydrochloric and the other mineral acids--namely, the\r\nabsence of corrosion of the skin. Ad. Lesser[94] has established, by\r\ndirect experiment, that it is not possible to make any permanent mark on\r\nthe skin by the application even of the strongest commercial acid (40\r\nper cent.). Hence, in any case of suspected poisoning by acid, should\r\nthere be stains on the lips and face as from an acid, the presumption\r\nwill be rather against hydrochloric. The symptoms themselves differ very\r\nlittle from those produced by sulphuric acid. The pathological\r\nappearances also are not essentially different, but hydrochloric is a\r\nweaker acid, and the extensive disorganisation, solution, and\r\nperforation of the viscera, noticed occasionally with sulphuric acid,\r\nhave never been found in hydrochloric acid poisoning. We may quote here\r\nthe following case:--\r\n\r\n[94] Virchow’s _Archiv f. path. Anat._, Bd. 83, Hft. 2, S. 215, 1881.\r\n\r\nA woman, under the influence of great and sudden grief--not unmixed with\r\npassion--drew a bottle from her pocket, and emptied it very quickly. She\r\nimmediately uttered a cry, writhed, and vomited a yellow-green fluid.\r\nThe abdomen also became enlarged. Milk was given her, but she could not\r\nswallow it, and death took place, in convulsions, two hours after the\r\ndrinking of the poison.\r\n\r\nThe _post-mortem_ appearances were briefly as follows:--Mouth and tongue\r\nfree from textural change: much gas in the abdomen, more especially in\r\nthe stomach; the membranes of the brain congested; the lungs filled with\r\nblood. The stomach was strongly pressed forward, of a dark brown-red,\r\nand exhibited many irregular blackish spots, varying from two lines to\r\nhalf an inch in diameter (the spots were drier and harder than the rest\r\nof the stomach); the mucous membrane, internally, was generally\r\nblackened, and changed to a carbonised, shaggy, slimy mass, while the\r\norgan was filled with a blackish homogeneous pulp, which had no odour.\r\nThe gullet was also blackened. A considerable quantity of hydrochloric\r\nacid was separated from the stomach.[95]\r\n\r\n[95] _Preuss. Med. Vereinszeit. u. Friederichs Blätter f. gerichtl.\r\nAnthropologie_, 1858, Hft. 6, S. 70.\r\n\r\nThe termination in this instance was unusually rapid. In a case detailed\r\nby Casper,[96] in which a boy drank an unknown quantity of acid, death\r\ntook place in seven hours. In Guy’s Hospital museum, the duodenum and\r\nstomach are preserved of a patient who is said to have died in nine and\r\na half hours from half an ounce of the acid. The same quantity, in a\r\ncase related by Taylor, caused death in eighteen hours. From these and\r\nother instances, it may be presumed that death from acute poisoning by\r\nhydrochloric acid will probably take place within twenty-four hours.\r\nFrom the secondary effects, of course, death may take place at a remote\r\nperiod, _e.g._, in a case recorded by Dr. Duncan (_Lancet_, April 12,\r\n1890), a man drank about 1 oz. of HCl accidentally, was admitted to\r\nCharing Cross Hospital the same day, and treated with small quantities\r\nof sodium carbonate, and fed by the rectum. On the eighth day he brought\r\nup 34 oz. of blood; in a month he left apparently perfectly well, but\r\nwas admitted again in about six weeks, and died of contraction of the\r\nstomach and stricture of the pylorus on the ninety-fourth day.\r\n\r\n[96] Case 230.--_Gerichtliche Medicin_, 6th Ed., Berlin, 1876.\r\n\r\n§76. =Post-mortem Appearances.=--The pathological appearances are very\r\nsimilar to those found in the case already detailed; though the skin of\r\nthe face may not be eroded in any way by the acid, yet the more delicate\r\nmucous membrane of the mouth, gullet, &c., appears mostly to be changed,\r\nand is usually white or whitish-brown. There is, however, in the museum\r\nof the Royal College of Surgeons the stomach and gullet (No. 2386c.) of\r\nan infant thirteen months old; the infant drank a tea-cupful of strong\r\nhydrochloric acid, and died nine hours after the dose. The pharynx and\r\nthe upper end of the gullet is quite normal, the corrosive action\r\ncommencing at the lower end, so that, although the acid was\r\nconcentrated, not the slightest effect was produced on the delicate\r\nmucous membrane of the throat and upper part of the gullet. The lower\r\nend of the gullet and the whole of the stomach were intensely congested;\r\nthe rugæ of the latter were ecchymosed and blackened by the action of\r\nthe acid. There were also small hæmorrhages in the lungs, which were\r\nascribed to the action of the acid on the blood. Perforation of the\r\nstomach has not been noticed in hydrochloric acid poisoning.\r\n\r\nIn Guy’s Hospital museum (prep. 1799¹⁰), the stomach and duodenum of the\r\ncase mentioned exhibit the mucous membrane considerably injected, with\r\nextravasations of blood, which, at the time when the preparation was\r\nfirst arranged, were of various hues, but are now somewhat altered,\r\nthrough long keeping in spirit. In St. George’s Hospital museum (ser. x.\r\n43, d. 200) are preserved the stomach and part of the duodenum of a\r\nperson who died from hydrochloric acid. The case is detailed in the\r\n_Medical Times and Gazette_ for 1853, vol. ii. p. 513. The whole inner\r\nsurface appears to be in a sloughing state, and the larynx and lung were\r\nalso inflamed.\r\n\r\nA preparation, presented by Mr. Bowman to King’s College Hospital\r\nmuseum, exhibits the effects of a very large dose of hydrochloric acid.\r\nThe gullet has a shrivelled and worm-eaten appearance; the stomach is\r\ninjected with black blood, and was filled with an acid, grumous\r\nmatter.[97]\r\n\r\n[97] A drawing of parts of the gullet and stomach is given in Guy and\r\nFerrier’s _Forensic Medicine_.\r\n\r\nLooking at these and other museum preparations illustrating the effects\r\nof sulphuric and hydrochloric acids, I was unable (in default of the\r\nhistory of the cases) to distinguish between the two, by the naked eye\r\nappearances, save in those cases in which the disorganisation was so\r\nexcessive as to render hydrochloric acid improbable. On the other hand,\r\nthe changes produced by nitric acid are so distinctive, that it is\r\nimpossible to mistake its action for that of any other acid. The nitric\r\nacid pathological preparations may be picked out at a glance.\r\n\r\n\r\nDetection and Estimation of Free Hydrochloric Acid.\r\n\r\n§ 77. (1) =Detection.=--A large number of colouring reagents have been\r\nproposed as tests for the presence of free mineral acid; among the best\r\nis _methyl-aniline violet_ decolorised by a large amount of hydrochloric\r\nacid; the violet turns to green with a moderate quantity, and to blue\r\nwith a small quantity.\r\n\r\n=Tropæolin= (00), in the presence of free mineral acid, strikes a\r\nruby-red to a dark brown-red.\r\n\r\n=Congo-red= is used in the form of paper dyed with the material; large\r\namounts of free hydrochloric acid strike blue-black, small quantities\r\nblue.\r\n\r\n=Günzburg’s test= is 2 parts phloroglucin and 1 part vanillin, dissolved\r\nin 100 parts of alcohol. Fine red crystals are precipitated on the\r\naddition of hydrochloric acid. To test the stomach contents for free\r\nhydrochloric acid by means of this reagent, equal parts of the fluid and\r\nthe test are evaporated to dryness in the water-bath in a porcelain\r\ndish. If free hydrochloric acid be present, the evaporated residue shows\r\na red colour; 1 mgrm. of acid can by this test be detected. The reaction\r\nis not interfered with by organic acids, peptones, or albumin.\r\n\r\nJaksch speaks highly of _benzopurpurin_ as a test. Filter-paper is\r\nsoaked in a saturated aqueous solution of benzopurpurin 6 B (the variety\r\n1 or 4 B is not so sensitive), and the filter-paper thus prepared\r\nallowed to dry. On testing the contents of the stomach with the reagent,\r\nif there is more than 4 parts per 1000 of hydrochloric acid the paper is\r\nstained intensely blue-black; but if the colour is brown-black, this is\r\nfrom butyric or lactic acids, or from a mixture of these acids with\r\nhydrochloric acid. If the paper is washed with pure ether, and the\r\ncolour was due only to organic acids, the original hue of the paper is\r\nrestored; if the colour produced was due to a mixture of mineral and\r\norganic acids, the brown-black colour is weakened; and, lastly, if due\r\nto hydrochloric acid alone, the colour is not altered by washing with\r\nether. Acid salts have no action, nor is the test interfered with by\r\nlarge amounts of albumins and peptones.\r\n\r\nA. Villiers and M. Favolle[98] have published a sensitive test for\r\nhydrochloric acid. The test consists of a saturated aqueous solution of\r\ncolourless aniline, 4 parts; glacial acetic acid, 1 part; 0·1 mgrm. of\r\nhydrochloric acid strikes with this reagent a blue colour, 1 mgrm. a\r\nblack colour. The liquid under examination is brought by evaporation, or\r\nby the addition of water, to 10 c.c. and placed in a flask; to this is\r\nadded 5 c.c. of a mixture of equal parts of sulphuric acid and water,\r\nthen 10 c.c. of a saturated solution of potassic permanganate, and\r\nheated gently, conveying the gases into 3 to 5 c.c. of the reagent\r\ncontained in a test-tube immersed in water. If, however, bromine or\r\niodine (one or both) should be present, the process is modified as\r\nfollows:--The hydracids are precipitated by silver nitrate; the\r\nprecipitate is washed, transferred to a small flask, and treated with 10\r\nc.c. of water and 1 c.c. of pure ammonia. With this strength of ammonia\r\nthe chloride of silver is dissolved easily, the iodide not at all, and\r\nthe bromide but slightly. The ammoniacal solution is filtered, boiled,\r\nand treated with SH₂; the excess of SH₂ is expelled by boiling, the\r\nliquid filtered, reduced to 10 c.c. by boiling or evaporation,\r\nsulphuric acid and permanganate added as before, and the gases passed\r\ninto the aniline. The process is inapplicable to the detection of\r\nchlorides or hydrochloric acid if cyanides are present, and it is more\r\nadapted for traces of hydrochloric acid than for the quantities likely\r\nto be met with in a toxicological inquiry.\r\n\r\n[98] _Comptes Rend._, cxviii.\r\n\r\n(2) =Quantitative estimation of Free Hydrochloric Acid.=--The contents\r\nof the stomach are diluted to a known volume, say 250 or 500 c.c. A\r\nfractional portion is taken, say 10 c.c., coloured with litmus or\r\nphenol-phthalein, and a decinormal solution of soda added drop by drop\r\nuntil the colour changes; this gives total acidity. Another 10 c.c. is\r\nshaken with double its volume of ether three times, the fluid separated\r\nfrom ether and titrated in the same way; this last titration will give\r\nthe acidity due to mineral acids and acid salts;[99] if the only mineral\r\nacid present is hydrochloric acid the results will be near the truth if\r\nreckoned as such, and this method, although not exact for physiological\r\nresearch, is usually sufficient for the purpose of ascertaining the\r\namount of hydrochloric acid or other mineral acids in a case of\r\npoisoning. It depends on the fact that ether extracts free organic\r\nacids, such as butyric and lactic acids, but does not extract mineral\r\nacids.\r\n\r\n[99] To distinguish between acidity due to free acid and acid salts, or\r\nto acidity due to the combined action of acid salts and free acids, the\r\nmethod of Leo and Uffelmann is useful. A fractional portion of the\r\ncontents of the stomach is triturated with pure calcium carbonate; if\r\nall the acidity is due to free acid, the fluid in a short time becomes\r\nneutral to litmus; if, on the other hand, the acidity is due entirely to\r\nacid salts, the fluid remains acid; or, if due to both acid and acid\r\nsalts, there is a proportionate diminution of acidity due to the\r\ndecomposition of the lime carbonate by the free acid. A quantitative\r\nmethod has been devised upon these principles. See Leo, _Diagnostik der\r\nKrankheiten der Verdauungsorgane_, Hirschwald, Berlin, 1890.\r\n\r\nThe free mineral acid, after extracting the organic acid by ether, can\r\nalso be saturated with cinchonine; this hydrochlorate of cinchonine is\r\nextracted by chloroform, evaporated to dryness, and the residue\r\ndissolved in water acidified by nitric acid and precipitated by silver\r\nnitrate; the silver chloride produced is collected on a small filter,\r\nwashed, and the filter, with its contents, dried and ignited in a\r\nporcelain crucible; the silver chloride, multiplied by 0·25426, equals\r\nHCl.\r\n\r\nThe best method of estimating free hydrochloric acid in the stomach is\r\nthat of Sjokvist as modified by v. Jaksch;[100] it has the disadvantage\r\nof its accuracy being interfered with by phosphates; it also does not\r\ndistinguish between actual free HCl and the loosely bound HCl with\r\nalbuminous matters,--this in a toxicological case is of small\r\nimportance, because the quantities of HCl found are likely to be large.\r\n\r\n[100] _Klinische Diagnostik_, Dr. Rudolph v. Jaksch, Wien u. Leipzig,\r\n1892. _Clinical Diagnosis_. English Translation, by Dr. Cagney. Second\r\nEdition. London: Charles Griffin & Co., Limited.\r\n\r\nThe method is based upon the fact that if carbonate of baryta be added\r\nto the contents of the stomach, the organic acids will decompose the\r\nbarium carbonate, forming butyrate, acetate, lactate, &c., of barium;\r\nand the mineral acids, such as hydrochloric acid, will combine, forming\r\nsalts of barium.\r\n\r\nOn ignition, chloride of barium will be unaffected, while the organic\r\nsalts of barium will be converted into carbonate of barium, practically\r\ninsoluble in carbonic acid free water.\r\n\r\nThe contents of the stomach are coloured with litmus, and barium\r\ncarbonate added until the fluid is no longer acid (as shown by the\r\ndisappearance of the red colour); then the contents are evaporated to\r\ndryness in a platinum dish, and ignited at a dull red heat; complete\r\nburning to an ash is not necessary. After cooling, the burnt mass is\r\nrepeatedly exhausted with boiling water and filtered; the chloride of\r\nbarium is precipitated from the filtrate by means of dilute sulphuric\r\nacid; the barium sulphate filtered off, washed, dried, and, after\r\nignition, weighed; 233 parts of barium sulphate equal 73 parts of HCl.\r\n\r\nA method somewhat quicker, but depending on the same principles, has\r\nbeen suggested by Braun.[101] A fractional part, say 10 c.c., of the\r\nfluid contents is coloured by litmus and titrated with decinormal soda.\r\nTo the same quantity is added 2 or 3 more c.c. of decinormal soda than\r\nthe quantity used in the first titration; this alkaline liquid is\r\nevaporated to dryness and ultimately ignited. To the ash is now added\r\nexactly the quantity of decinormal sulphuric acid as the decinormal soda\r\nlast used to make it alkaline--that is to say, if the total acidity was\r\nequal to 3·6 d.n. soda, and 5·0 d.n. soda was added to the 10 c.c.\r\nevaporated to dryness and burned, then 5·6 c.c. of d.n. sulphuric acid\r\nis added to the ash. The solution is now warmed to get rid of carbon\r\ndioxide, and, after addition of a little phenolphthalein, titrated with\r\nd.n. soda solution until the change of colour shows saturation, the\r\nnumber of c.c. used, multiplied by 0·00365, equals the HCl.\r\n\r\n[101] _Op. cit._, S. 157.\r\n\r\n§78. In investigating the stains from hydrochloric acid on fabrics, or\r\nthe leaves of plants, any free hydrochloric acid may be separated by\r\nboiling with water, and then investigating the aqueous extract. Should,\r\nhowever, the stain be old, all free acid may have disappeared, and yet\r\nsome of the chlorine remain in organic combination with the tissue, or\r\nin combination with bases. Dr. Angus Smith has found weighed portions of\r\nleaves, &c., which had been exposed to the action of hydrochloric acid\r\nfumes, richer in chlorides than similar parts of the plants not thus\r\nexposed.\r\n\r\nThe most accurate method of investigation for the purpose of separating\r\nchlorine from combination with organic matters is to cut out the\r\nstained portions, weigh them, and burn them up in a combustion-tube,\r\nthe front portion of the tube being filled with caustic lime known to be\r\nfree from chlorides; a similar experiment must be made with the\r\nunstained portions. In this way a considerable difference may often be\r\nfound; and it is not impossible, in some instances, to thus detect,\r\nafter the lapse of many years, that certain stains have been produced by\r\na chlorine-holding substance.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--Nitric Acid.\r\n\r\n§ 79. =General Properties.=--Nitric acid--commonly known in England as\r\n_aqua fortis_, chemically as _nitric acid_, _hydric nitrate_, or _nitric\r\nmonohydrate_--is a mono-hydrate of nitrogen pentoxide (N₂O₅), two\r\nequivalents, or 126 parts, of nitric acid containing 108 of N₂O₅, and 18\r\nof H₂O. Anhydrous nitric acid, or nitrogen pentoxide, can be obtained by\r\npassing, with special precautions, dry chlorine over silver nitrate; the\r\nproducts are free oxygen and nitrogen pentoxide, according to the\r\nfollowing equation:--\r\n\r\n   Silver    Chlorine.    Silver      Nitrogen    Oxygen.\r\n  Nitrate.               Chloride.   Pentoxide.\r\n  Ag₂O,N₂O₅ +   2Cl     =   2AgCl   +   N₂O₅      +   O\r\n\r\nBy surrounding the receiver with a freezing mixture, the acid is\r\ncondensed in crystals, which dissolve in water, with emission of much\r\nheat, forming nitric acid. Sometimes the crystals, though kept in sealed\r\ntubes, decompose, and the tube, from the pressure of the liberated\r\ngases, bursts with a dangerous explosion.\r\n\r\nPure nitric acid has a specific gravity of 1·52, and boils at 98°. Dr.\r\nUre examined the boiling point and other properties of nitric acid very\r\nfully. An acid of 1·5 specific gravity boils at 98·8°; of specific\r\ngravity 1·45, at 115·5°; specific gravity 1·40, at 118·8°; of specific\r\ngravity 1·42, at 122·8°. The acid of specific gravity 1·42 is the\r\nstandard acid of the British Pharmacopœia. It can always be obtained by\r\ndistilling either strong or moderately weak nitric acid; for, on the one\r\nhand, the acid on distillation gets weaker until the gravity of 1·42 is\r\nreached, or, on the other, it becomes stronger.\r\n\r\nThere is little doubt that acid of 1·42 gravity is a definite hydrate,\r\nconsisting of 1 atom of dry acid and 4 atoms of water; it corresponds to\r\n75 per cent.[102] of the liquid acid HNO₃. There are also at least two\r\nother hydrates known--one an acid of 1·485 specific gravity,\r\ncorresponding to 1 atom of dry acid and 2 of water, and an acid of\r\nspecific gravity 1·334, corresponding to 1 atom of dry acid and 7 atoms\r\nof water.\r\n\r\n[102] The British Pharmacopœia states that the 1·42 acid equals 70 per\r\ncent. of HNO₃; but this is not in accordance with Ure’s Tables, nor with\r\nthe facts.\r\n\r\nIn Germany the officinal acid is of 1·185 specific gravity,\r\ncorresponding to about 30 per cent. of HNO₃. The dilute nitric acid of\r\nthe Pharmacopœia is a colourless liquid, of specific gravity 1·101, and\r\nshould contain about 17·4 per cent. of acid. The acids used in various\r\nindustries are known respectively as _dyers’_ and _engravers’_ acid.\r\n_Dyers’_ acid has a specific gravity of 1·33 to 1·34 (66° to 68° Twad.),\r\nthat is, strength from 56 to 58 per cent. of HNO₃. _Engravers’_ acid is\r\nstronger; being of 1·40 specific gravity (80° Twad.); and contains 70\r\nper cent. of HNO₃. Although the _pure_ acid of commerce is (and should\r\nbe) almost colourless, most commercial specimens are of hues from yellow\r\nup to deep red. An acid saturated with red oxides of nitrogen is often\r\nknown as “fuming nitric acid.”\r\n\r\n§ 80. =Use in the Arts.=--Nitric acid is employed very extensively in\r\nthe arts and manufactures. The dyer uses it as a solvent for tin in the\r\npreparation of valuable mordants for calico and other fabrics; the\r\nengraver uses it for etching copper. It is an indispensable agent in the\r\nmanufacture of gun-cotton, nitro-glycerin, picric acid, and sulphuric\r\nacid; it is also used in the manufacture of tallow, in preparing the\r\nfelt for hats, and in the gilding trades. It is said to be utilised to\r\nmake yellowish or fawn-coloured spots on cigar leaves, so as to give\r\nthem the appearance of age and quality. It is also used as a medicine.\r\n\r\n§ 81. =Statistics of Poisoning by Nitric Acid.=--In the ten years\r\n1883-1892 no case of murder was ascribed to nitric acid, but it caused\r\naccidentally 25 deaths, and was used in 27 cases of suicide.\r\n\r\nThe following tables give the age and sex distribution of these\r\ndeaths:--\r\n\r\nDEATHS IN ENGLAND AND WALES DURING THE TEN YEARS ENDING 1892 FROM NITRIC\r\nACID.\r\n\r\n                ACCIDENT OR NEGLIGENCE.\r\n\r\n  Ages,      1-5  5-15  15-25  25-65  65 and  Total\r\n                                      above\r\n  Males,      6     2      1      9    ...      18\r\n  Females,    3   ...    ...      4    ...       7\r\n             --------------------------------------\r\n  Totals,     9     2      1     13    ...      25\r\n             --------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                       SUICIDE.\r\n\r\n  Ages,                 15-25  25-65  65 and  Total\r\n                                      above\r\n  Males,                   3     14      1      18\r\n  Females,                 1      8    ...       9\r\n                       ----------------------------\r\n  Totals,                  4     22      1      27\r\n                       ----------------------------\r\n\r\n§ 82. =Fatal Dose.=--The dose which causes death has not been\r\nascertained with any exactness. As in the case of sulphuric acid, we may\r\ngo so far as to say that it is possible for a few drops of the strong\r\nacid to be fatal, for if brought into contact with the vocal apparatus,\r\nfatal spasm of the glottis might be excited. The smallest dose on record\r\nis 7·7 grms. (2 drachms), which killed a child aged 13.\r\n\r\n§ 83. =Action of Nitric Acid on Vegetation.=--Nitric acid acts on plants\r\ninjuriously in a two-fold manner--viz., by direct corrosive action, and\r\nalso by decomposing the chlorides which all plants contain, thus setting\r\nfree chlorine, which decomposes and bleaches the chlorophyll. The action\r\nis most intense on soft and delicate leaves, such as those of clover,\r\nthe cabbage, and all the cruciferæ. The tobacco plant is particularly\r\ninjured by nitric acid. Next to all herbaceous plants, trees, such as\r\nthe apple, pear, and fruit trees, generally suffer. The coniferæ,\r\nwhether from their impregnation with resin, or from some other cause,\r\npossess a considerable resisting-power against nitric acid vapours, and\r\nthe same is true as regards the cereals; in the latter case, their\r\nsiliceous armour acts as a preserving agent.\r\n\r\n§ 84. =Nitric Acid Vapour.=--The action of nitric acid in a state of\r\nvapour, as evolved by warming potassic nitrate and sulphuric acid\r\ntogether, has been studied by Eulenberg. A rabbit was placed under a\r\nshade into which 63 grains of nitric acid in a state of vapour were\r\nintroduced. From the conditions of the experiment, some nitric peroxide\r\nmust also have been present. Irritation of the external mucous membranes\r\nand embarrassment in breathing were observed. The animal in forty-five\r\nminutes was removed, and suffered afterwards from a croupous bronchitis,\r\nfrom which, however, it completely recovered in eleven days. A second\r\nexperiment with the same animal was followed by death. On inspection,\r\nthere was found strong injection of the cerebral membranes, with small\r\nextravasations of blood; the lungs were excessively congested; the right\r\nmiddle lobe especially was of a liver-brown colour, and empty of air: it\r\nsank in water.\r\n\r\nO. Lassar[103] has also made a series of researches on the influence of\r\nnitric acid vapour, from which he concludes that the acid is not\r\nabsorbed by the blood, but acts only by its mechanical irritation, for\r\nhe could not trace, by means of an examination of the urine, any\r\nevidence of such absorption.\r\n\r\n[103] Hoppe-Seyler’s _Zeitschrift f. physiol. Chemie_, Bd. i. S.\r\n165-173, 1877-78.\r\n\r\nThere are a few instances on record of the vapour having been fatal to\r\nmen; for example, the well-known case of Mr. Haywood, a chemist of\r\nSheffield, may be cited. In pouring a mixture of nitric and sulphuric\r\nacids from a carboy of sixty pounds capacity, the vessel broke, and for\r\na few minutes he inhaled the mixed fumes. He died eleven hours after\r\nthe accident, although for the first three hours there were scarcely any\r\nsymptoms of an injurious effect having been produced. On inspection,\r\nthere was found intense congestion of the windpipe and bronchial tubes,\r\nwith effusion of blood in the latter. The lining membrane of the heart\r\nand aorta was inflamed; unfortunately, the larynx was not examined.[104]\r\n\r\n[104] _Lancet_, April 15, 1854, p. 430.\r\n\r\nA very similar case happened in Edinburgh in 1863.[105] Two young men\r\nwere carrying a jar of nitric acid; the jar broke, and they attempted to\r\nwipe up the acid from the floor. The one died ten hours after the\r\naccident, the other in less than twenty-four hours. The symptoms were\r\nmainly those of difficult breathing, and it is probable that death was\r\nproduced from suffocation. Dr. Taylor relates also, that having\r\naccidentally inhaled the vapour in preparing gun-cotton, he suffered\r\nfrom severe constriction of the throat, tightness in the chest, and\r\ncough, for more than a week.[106]\r\n\r\n[105] _Chemical News_, March 14, 1863, p. 132.\r\n\r\n[106] _Principles and Practice of Medical Jurisprudence_, vol. i., 1873,\r\np. 218.\r\n\r\n§ 85. =Effects of Liquid Nitric Acid.=--Poisoning by nitric acid, though\r\nstill rare, is naturally more frequent than formerly. At the beginning\r\nof this century, Tartra[107] wrote a most excellent monograph on the\r\nsubject, and collated all the cases he could find, from the first\r\nrecorded instances related by Bembo[108] in Venetian history, down to\r\nhis own time. The number of deaths in those 400 years was but\r\nfifty-five, while, in our century, at least fifty can be numbered. Most\r\nof these (74 per cent.) are suicidal, a very few homicidal, the rest\r\naccidental. In one of Tartra’s cases, some nitric acid was placed in the\r\nwine of a drunken woman, with fatal effect. Osenbrüggen[109] relates the\r\ncase of a father murdering his six children by means of nitric acid; and\r\nC. A. Büchner[110] that of a soldier who poured acid into the mouth of\r\nhis illegitimate infant. A curious case is one in which a man poisoned\r\nhis drunken wife by pouring the acid into her right ear; she died after\r\nsix weeks’ illness. All these instances prove again, if necessary, that\r\nthe acid is only likely to be used with murderous intent in the case of\r\nyoung children, or of sleeping, drunken, or otherwise helpless people.\r\n\r\n[107] Tartra, A. E., Dr., _Traité de l’Empoisonnement par l’Acide\r\nNitrique_, Paris, An. 10 (1802), pp. 300.\r\n\r\n[108] _Bembo Cardinalis, Rerum Venetarium Historiæ_, lib. xii., lib. i.\r\np. 12, Paris Ed., 1551.\r\n\r\n[109] _Allgem.-Deutsche Strafrechtszeitung, herausgeg. v.

Med._, 1866, Hft. 3, S. 187.\r\n\r\nAs an example of the way in which accidents are brought about by\r\nheedlessness, may be cited the recent case of a woman who bought a small\r\nquantity of aqua fortis for the purpose of allaying toothache by a\r\nlocal application. She attempted to pour the acid direct from the bottle\r\ninto the cavity of the tooth; the acid went down her throat, and the\r\nusual symptoms followed. She threw up a very perfect cast of the gullet\r\n(preserved in University College museum), and rapidly died. Nitric acid\r\nhas been mistaken for various liquids, and has also been used by\r\ninjection as an abortive, in every respect having a toxicological\r\nhistory similar to that of sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\n§ 86. =Local Action.=--When strong nitric acid comes in contact with\r\norganic matters, there is almost constantly a development of gas. The\r\ntissue is first bleached, and then becomes of a more or less intense\r\nyellow colour. Nitric acid spots on the skin are not removed by ammonia,\r\nbut become of an orange-red when moistened with potash and a solution of\r\ncyanide of potassium. The yellow colour seems to show that picric acid\r\nis one of the constant products of the reaction; sulphide of ammonium\r\nforms a sort of soap with the epidermis thus attacked, and detaches it.\r\n\r\n§ 87. =Symptoms.=--The symptoms and course of nitric acid poisoning\r\ndiffer in a few details only from those of sulphuric acid. There is the\r\nsame instant pain and frequent vomiting, destruction of the mucous\r\nmembranes, and, in the less severe cases, after-contraction of the\r\ngullet, &c.\r\n\r\nOne of the differences in the action of nitric and sulphuric acids is\r\nthe constant development of gas with the former. This, without doubt,\r\nadds to the suffering. Tartra made several experiments on dead bodies,\r\nand showed that very considerable distension of the intestinal canal, by\r\ngaseous products, was the constant result; the tissues were corroded and\r\nalmost dissolved, being transformed, ultimately, into a sort of greasy\r\npaste. The vomited matters are of a yellow colour, unless mixed with\r\nblood, when they are of a dirty-brown hue, with shreds of yellow mucus,\r\nand have the strong acid reaction and smell of nitric acid. The teeth\r\nmay be partially attacked from the solvent action of the acid on the\r\nenamel. The fauces and tongue, at first blanched, soon acquire a\r\ncitron-yellow, or even a brown colour; the whole cavity may swell and\r\ninflame, rendering the swallowing of liquids difficult, painful, and\r\nsometimes impossible. The air passages may also become affected, and in\r\none case tracheotomy was performed for the relief of the breathing.[111]\r\nThe stomach rejects all remedies; there are symptoms of collapse; quick,\r\nweak pulse, frequent shivering, obstinate constipation, and death (often\r\npreceded by a kind of stupor) in from eighteen to twenty-four hours. The\r\nintellectual faculties remain clear, save in a few rare instances.\r\n\r\n[111] Arnott, _Med. Gaz._, vol. xii. p. 220.\r\n\r\nC. A. Wunderlich has recorded an unusual case, in which the symptoms\r\nwere those of dysentery, and the large intestine was found acutely\r\ninflamed, while the small one was little affected. The kidneys had the\r\nsame appearance as in Bright’s disease.[112] The smallest fatal dose\r\ngiven by Taylor is from 2 drachms, which killed a child aged 13 years.\r\nShould the dose of nitric acid be insufficient to kill at once, or, what\r\namounts to the same thing, should the acid be immediately diluted with\r\nwater, or in some way be neutralised, the patient, as in the case of\r\nsulphuric acid, may yet die at a variable future time from stenosis of\r\nthe gullet, impaired digestion, &c. For example, in an interesting case\r\nrelated by Tartra,[113] a woman, who had swallowed 42 grms. (1·5 oz.) of\r\nnitric acid, feeling acute pain, took immediately a quantity of water,\r\nand three hours afterwards was admitted into hospital, where she\r\nreceived appropriate treatment. At the end of a month she left,\r\nbelieving herself cured; but in a little while returned, and was\r\nre-admitted, suffering from marasmus, extreme weakness, and constant\r\nvomiting; ultimately she died. The _post-mortem_ examination revealed\r\nextreme contraction of the intestinal canal throughout. The lumen would\r\nhardly admit a penholder. The stomach was no larger than an ordinary\r\nintestine, and adherent to adjacent organs; on its internal surface\r\nthere were spots, probably cicatrices; there were also changes in the\r\ngullet, but not so marked. A somewhat similar case is related by the\r\nsame author in his thirteenth observation. In the Middlesex Hospital\r\nthere is preserved the stomach (No. 1363) of a man who died forty days\r\nafter swallowing 2 ozs. of nitric acid diluted in a tumbler of water.\r\nThe stomach is contracted, the mucous membrane of the lower part of the\r\ngullet, the lesser curvature, and the pyloric end of the stomach is\r\nextensively corroded, showing ulcerated patches commencing to cicatrize.\r\n\r\n[112] _De Actionibus quibusdam Acidi Nitrici Caustico in Corpus Humanum\r\nimmissi. Programma Academ._, Lipsiæ, 1857, 4.\r\n\r\n[113] _Op. cit._\r\n\r\n§ 88. =Post-mortem Appearances.=--The pathological changes in the\r\ntongue, gullet, and stomach can be readily studied from the preparations\r\nin the different museums. The staining by the nitric acid appears\r\nunchanged to the naked eye for many years; hence, most of the nitric\r\nacid preparations are in an excellent state of preservation. A very good\r\nexample of the pathological changes is to be found in Nos. 1049 and\r\n1050, University College museum.\r\n\r\n    No. 1049 presents the tongue, pharynx, and larynx of a man who had\r\n    swallowed a tea-cupful of nitric acid. The epithelium of the\r\n    œsophagus is for the most part wanting, and hangs in shreds; the\r\n    dorsum of the tongue, in front of the circumvallate papillæ, is\r\n    excavated, and over its central part superficially ulcerated; in\r\n    other places the tongue is encrusted with a thick, loose,\r\n    fawn-coloured layer, formed probably of desquamated epithelium. The\r\n    whole of the mucous surface is stained of a dirty yellow.\r\n\r\n    No. 1050 is a preparation showing the tongue, gullet, and stomach of\r\n    a person who died from the effects of nitric acid. The tongue in\r\n    places is smooth and glazed; in others, slightly depressed and\r\n    excavated. On the anterior wall and lower portion of the gullet two\r\n    large sloughs exist.\r\n\r\n    Although perforation of the stomach is not so common with nitric as\r\n    with sulphuric acid, such an accident may occur, as shown in a\r\n    preparation at Guy’s Hospital, in which there is a perforation at\r\n    the cardiac end. All the mucous membrane has disappeared, and the\r\n    inner surface is for the most part covered with flocculent shreds.\r\n    Three ounces of nitric acid are said to have been swallowed, and the\r\n    patient lived seventeen hours. There is the usual staining. There is\r\n    also in the Middlesex Hospital (No. 1364) the œsophagus and stomach\r\n    of a woman aged 30, who died six hours after swallowing 2 to 3 ozs.\r\n    of strong nitric acid. The inner coats of the mucous membrane of the\r\n    gullet and stomach are in part converted into opaque yellow and\r\n    black eschars, and in part to a shreddy pulpy condition. At the most\r\n    depending part of the stomach is a large ragged perforation, with\r\n    pulpy margins, which allowed the contents of the stomach to escape\r\n    into the peritoneal cavity.\r\n\r\n    In St. Bartholomew’s museum, there is a very good specimen (No.\r\n    1870) of the appearances in the gullet and stomach after poisoning\r\n    by nitric acid. The case is detailed in _St. Bartholomew’s Hospital\r\n    Reports_, vol. v. p. 247. A male died in fifteen hours after\r\n    swallowing 1 oz. of nitric acid. The whole mucous membrane is\r\n    wrinkled, or rather ploughed, into longitudinal furrows, the yellow\r\n    discoloration stops abruptly, with an irregular border, at the\r\n    commencement of the stomach, the epithelial and mucous coats of\r\n    which are wanting--its surface being rough and of a brownish-red\r\n    colour.\r\n\r\n    The following preparations are to be found in the museum of the\r\n    London Hospital:--A. b. 1. and A. b. 8.--A. b. 1. shows the pharynx,\r\n    œsophagus, larynx, and stomach of a young woman, who, after taking\r\n    half an ounce of nitric acid, died in eight hours. The staining is\r\n    very intense; as an unusual feature, it may be noted that the larynx\r\n    is almost as yellow as the œsophagus. The abrasion or solution of\r\n    the epithelium on the dorsum of the tongue has dissected out the\r\n    circumvallate and fungiform papillæ, so that they project with\r\n    unusual distinctness. The lining membrane of the gullet throughout\r\n    is divided into minute squares by longitudinal and transverse\r\n    furrows. The mucous membrane of the stomach appears wholly\r\n    destroyed, and presents a woolly appearance.\r\n\r\n    A. b. 8. shows a very perfect cast of the œsophagus. The case was\r\n    that of a woman, aged 35, who swallowed half an ounce of nitric\r\n    acid. The symptoms for the first four days were the usual pain in\r\n    the throat and stomach, which might be expected; the bowels were\r\n    freely open, and the stools dark and offensive. On the sixth day,\r\n    there was constant vomiting with offensive breath; on the ninth, the\r\n    appearance of the patient was critical, and she threw up the cast\r\n    preserved. She died on the tenth day after the taking of the acid.\r\n    The gullet, stomach, trachea, and larynx were found after death much\r\n    inflamed.\r\n\r\n    The following preparations are in St. Thomas’ Hospital:--P. 5.--a\r\n    stomach with gullet attached. The stomach is covered with\r\n    yellowish-green patches of false membrane and deposit; the gullet\r\n    has the usual longitudinal furrows so characteristic of corrosive\r\n    fluids.\r\n\r\n    P. 6. is also from a case of nitric acid poisoning. It shows the\r\n    lining membrane of the stomach partly destroyed and shreddy, yet but\r\n    little discoloured, the hue being a sort of delicate fawn.\r\n\r\n    To these may be added a case described and figured by Lesser; to a\r\n    baby, a few days old, an unknown quantity of fuming nitric acid was\r\n    given; the child made a gurgling, choking sound, and died in a few\r\n    minutes. The corpse, nine days after death, showed no signs of\r\n    decomposition. The tongue and gums were yellow, the gullet less so,\r\n    the stomach still less, and the small intestine had no yellow tint;\r\n    the whole of the mouth, gullet, and stomach showed the corrosive\r\n    action of the acid. The graduation of tint, Lesser remarks, is what\r\n    is not seen when the yellow colour is due to poisoning by chromic\r\n    acid or by strong solution of ferric perchloride; in such cases,\r\n    wherever the liquid has gone, there is a yellowness.[114]\r\n\r\n[114] A. Lesser, _Atlas der gerichtlichen Medicin_, Berlin, 1884, Tafel\r\ni. fig. 2.\r\n\r\n§ 89. =Detection and Estimation of Nitric Acid.=--The detection either\r\nof free nitric acid or of its salts is not difficult. Free nitric acid,\r\nafter preliminary estimation of the total acidity by decinormal soda,\r\nmay be separated by the cinchonine process given at p. 100. On\r\nprecipitation by ammonia or soda solution, the nitrate of ammonia or\r\nsoda (and, it may be, other similarly combined acids) remain in\r\nsolution. If free nitric acid is present in small quantity only, it may\r\nbe necessary to evaporate the filtrate from the quinine nearly to\r\ndryness, and to test the concentrated liquid for nitric acid. The\r\nordinary tests are as follows:--\r\n\r\n(1.) Nitrates, treated with mercury or copper and strong sulphuric acid,\r\ndevelop nitric oxide, recognised by red fumes, if mixed with air or\r\noxygen.\r\n\r\n(2.) A nitrate dissolved in a small quantity of water, with the addition\r\nof a crystal of ferrous sulphate (allowed to partially dissolve), and\r\nthen of strong sulphuric acid--poured through a funnel with a long tube\r\ndipping to the bottom of the test-tube, so as to form a layer at the\r\nbottom--strikes a brown colour at the junction of the liquid. When the\r\ntest is properly performed, there will be three layers--the uppermost\r\nbeing the nitrate solution, the middle ferrous sulphate, and the lowest\r\nsulphuric acid; the middle layer becomes of a smoky or black hue if a\r\nnitrate is present. Organic matter interferes much with the reaction.\r\n\r\n(3.) Nitrates in solution, treated in the cold with a zinc copper\r\ncouple, are decomposed first into nitrites, and then into ammonia. The\r\nnitrites may be detected by a solution of metaphenyldiamine, which\r\nstrikes a red colour with an infinitesimal quantity. Hence, a solution\r\nwhich gives no red colour with metaphenyldiamine, when submitted to the\r\naction of a zinc copper couple, and tested from time to time, cannot\r\ncontain nitrites; therefore, no nitrates were originally present.\r\n\r\n(4.) Nitrates, on being treated with strong sulphuric acid, and then a\r\nsolution of indigo carmine dropped in, decolorise the indigo; this is a\r\nuseful test--not conclusive in itself, but readily applied, and if the\r\ncinchonine method of separation has been resorted to, with few sources\r\nof error.\r\n\r\nThere is a process of separating nitric acid direct from any organic\r\ntissue, which may sometimes be useful:--Place the substance in a strong,\r\nwide-mouthed flask, closed by a caoutchouc cork, and in the flask put a\r\nsmall, short test-tube, charged with a strong solution of ferrous\r\nchloride in hydrochloric acid. The flask is connected to the mercury\r\npump (see fig. p. 47), and made perfectly vacuous by raising and\r\nlowering the reservoir. When this is effected, the tube SS′P is adjusted\r\nso as to deliver any gas evolved into a eudiometer, or other\r\ngas-measuring apparatus. By a suitable movement of the flask, the acid\r\nferrous chloride is allowed to come in contact with the tissue, a gentle\r\nheat applied to the flask, and gases are evolved. These may be carbon\r\ndioxide, nitrogen, and nitric oxide. On the evolution of gas ceasing,\r\nthe carbon dioxide is absorbed by passing up under the mercury a little\r\ncaustic potash. When absorption is complete, the gas, consisting of\r\nnitrogen and nitric oxide, may be measured. A bubble or two of oxygen is\r\nnow passed into the eudiometer; if nitric oxide is present, red fumes at\r\nonce develop. On absorbing the excess of oxygen and the nitric peroxide\r\nby alkaline pyrogallate, and measuring the residual gas, it is easy to\r\ncalculate how much nitric oxide was originally present, according to the\r\nprinciples laid down in “Foods,” p. 587.\r\n\r\nIt is also obvious that, by treating nitric oxide with oxygen, and\r\nabsorbing the nitric peroxide present by an alkaline liquid of known\r\nstrength and free from nitrates or ammonia, the resulting solution may\r\nbe dealt with by a zinc copper couple, and the ammonia developed by the\r\naction of the couple directly estimated by titration by a decinormal\r\nhydrochloric acid, if large in quantity, or by “_nesslerising_,” if\r\nsmall in quantity. Crum’s method of estimating nitrates (“Foods,” p.\r\n568) in the cases of minute stains on fabrics, &c., with a little\r\nmodification, may be occasionally applicable.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.--Acetic Acid.\r\n\r\n    § 90. In the ten years ending 1893 nine deaths (four males and five\r\n    females) occurred in England and Wales from drinking, by mistake or\r\n    design, strong acetic acid.\r\n\r\n    A few cases only have been recorded in medical literature although\r\n    there have been many experiments on animals.\r\n\r\n    The symptoms in the human subject consist of pain, vomiting, and\r\n    convulsions.\r\n\r\n    In animals it causes colic, paralysis of the extremities, bloody\r\n    urine, and œdema of the lungs. The lethal dose for plant-eating\r\n    animals is about 0·49 gramme per kilo.\r\n\r\n    There should be no difficulty in recognising acetic acid; the odour\r\n    alone is, in most cases, strong and unmistakable. Traces are\r\n    detected by distilling, neutralising the distillate by soda,\r\n    evaporating to dryness, and treating the residue as follows:--A\r\n    portion warmed with alcohol and sulphuric acid gives a smell of\r\n    acetic ether. Another portion is heated in a small tube of hard\r\n    glass with arsenious acid; if acetic acid is present, or an acetate,\r\n    a smell of kakodyl is produced.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.--Ammonia.\r\n\r\n§ 91. Ammonia, (NH₃), is met with either as a vapour or gas, or as a\r\nsolution of the pure gas in water.\r\n\r\n=Properties.=--Pure ammonia gas is colourless, with a strong,\r\nirritating, pungent odour, forming white fumes of ammonic chloride, if\r\nexposed to hydric chloride vapour, and turning red moist litmus-paper\r\nstrongly blue. By intense cold, or by a pressure of 6½ atmospheres at\r\nthe ordinary temperature, the gas is readily liquefied; the liquid\r\nammonia boils at 38°; its observed specific gravity is ·731; it freezes\r\nat -57·1°. Ammonia is readily absorbed by water; at 0° water will take\r\nup 1000 times its own volume, and at ordinary temperatures about 600\r\ntimes its volume. Alcohol also absorbs about 10 per cent. Ammonia is a\r\nstrong base, and forms a number of salts. Ammonia is one of the constant\r\nproducts of the putrefaction of nitrogenous substances; it exists in the\r\natmosphere in small proportions, and in everything that contains water.\r\nIndeed, water is the only compound equal to it in its universality of\r\ndiffusion. The minute quantities of ammonia thus diffused throughout\r\nnature are probably never in the free state, but combinations of ammonia\r\nwith hydric nitrate, carbon dioxide, &c.\r\n\r\n§ 92. =Uses.=[115]--A solution of ammonia in water has many applications\r\nin the arts and industries; it is used in medicine, and is an\r\nindispensable laboratory reagent.\r\n\r\n[115] Sir B. W. Richardson has shown that ammonia possesses powerful\r\nantiseptic properties.--_Brit. Med. Journal_, 1862.\r\n\r\nThe officinal caustic preparations of ammonia are--_ammoniæ liquor\r\nfortior_ (_strong solution of ammonia_), which should contain 32·5 per\r\ncent. of ammonia, and have a specific gravity of ·891.\r\n\r\n_Liquor ammoniæ_ (_solution of ammonia_), specific gravity ·959, and\r\ncontaining 10 per cent. of ammonia. There is also a _liniment of\r\nammonia_, composed of olive oil, 3 parts, and ammonia, 1 part.\r\n\r\n_Spiritus Ammoniæ Fœtidus_ (_fœtid spirit of ammonia_).--A solution of\r\nassafœtida in rectified spirit and ammonia solution, 100 parts by\r\nmeasure, contains 10 of strong solution of ammonia.\r\n\r\nStrong solution of ammonia is an important ingredient in the\r\n“_linimentum camphoræ composita_” (_compound liniment of camphor_), the\r\ncomposition of which is as follows:--camphor, 2·5 parts; oil of\r\nlavender, ·125; strong solution of ammonia, 5·0; and rectified spirit,\r\n15 parts. Its content of strong solution of ammonia is then about 22·6\r\nper cent. (equivalent to 7·3 of NH₃).[116]\r\n\r\n[116] There is a common liniment for horses used in stables, and\r\npopularly known as “white oil.” It contains 1 part of ammonia, and 4\r\nparts of olive or rape oil; not unfrequently turpentine is added.\r\nAnother veterinary liniment, called “egg oil,” contains ammonia, oil of\r\noriganum, turpentine, and the yelks of eggs.\r\n\r\n_The carbonate of ammonia_ is also caustic; it is considered to be a\r\ncompound of acid carbonate of ammonium, NH₄HCO₃, with carbamate of\r\nammonium, NH₄NH₂CO₂. It is in the form of colourless, crystalline\r\nmasses; the odour is powerfully ammoniacal; it is strongly alkaline, and\r\nthe taste is acrid. It completely volatilises with heat, is soluble in\r\nwater, and somewhat soluble in spirit.\r\n\r\nThe officinal preparation is the “_spiritus ammoniæ aromaticus_,” or\r\naromatic spirit of ammonia. It is made by distilling in a particular way\r\nammonic carbonate, 4 ozs.; strong solution of ammonia, 8 ozs.; rectified\r\nspirit, 120 ozs.; water, 60 ozs.; volatile oil of nutmeg, 4½ drms.; and\r\noil of lemon, 6½ drms. Aromatic spirit of ammonia is a solution in a\r\nweak spirit of neutral carbonate, flavoured with oil of lemon and\r\nnutmeg; the specific gravity should be 0·896.\r\n\r\n_Smelling salts_ (_sal volatile_) are composed of carbonate of ammonia.\r\n\r\n§ 93. =Statistics.=--Falck has found throughout literature notices of\r\nthirty cases of poisoning by ammonia, or some of its preparations. In\r\ntwo of these it was used as a poison for the purpose of murder, and in\r\neight with suicidal intent; the remainder were all accidental. The two\r\ncriminal cases were those of children, who both died. Six out of eight\r\nof the suicidal, and twelve of the twenty accidental cases also\r\nterminated fatally.\r\n\r\nAmmonia was the cause of 64 deaths (39 male, 25 female) by accident and\r\nof 34 (18 male, 16 female) by suicide, making a total of 98 during the\r\nten years 1883-1892 in England and Wales. At present it occupies the\r\nseventh place among poisons as a cause of accident, the ninth as a means\r\nof suicide.\r\n\r\n§ 94. =Poisoning by Ammonia Vapour.=--Strong ammoniacal vapour is fatal\r\nto both animal and vegetable life. There are, however, but few instances\r\nof poisoning by ammonia vapour; these few cases have been, without\r\nexception, the result of accident. Two cases of death are recorded, due\r\nto an attempt to rouse epileptics from stupor, by an injudicious use of\r\nstrong ammonia applied to the nostrils. In another case, when\r\nhydrocyanic acid had been taken, there was the same result. An instance\r\nis also on record of poisonous effects from the breaking of a bottle of\r\nammonia, and the sudden evolution in this way of an enormous volume of\r\nthe caustic gas. Lastly, a man employed in the manufacture of ice, by\r\nmeans of the liquefaction of ammonia (Carré’s process), breathed the\r\nvapour, and had a narrow escape for his life.\r\n\r\n§ 95. =Symptoms.=--The symptoms observed in the last case may well serve\r\nas a type of what may be expected to occur after breathing ammonia\r\nvapour. The man remained from five to ten minutes in the stream of gas;\r\nhe then experienced a feeling of anxiety, and a sense of constriction in\r\nthe epigastrium, burning in the throat, and giddiness. He vomited. The\r\npulse was small and frequent, the face pale, the mouth and throat\r\nstrongly reddened, with increased secretion. Auscultation and percussion\r\nof the chest elicited nothing abnormal, although during the course of\r\nfour days he had from time to time symptoms of suffocation, which were\r\nrelieved by emetics. He recovered by the eighth day.[117]\r\n\r\n[117] Schmidt’s _Jahrbuch_, 1872, i. S. 30.\r\n\r\nIn experiments on animals, very similar symptoms are produced. There is\r\nincreased secretion of the eyes, nose, and mouth, with redness. The cry\r\nof cats becomes remarkably hoarse, and they generally vomit. Great\r\ndifficulty in breathing and tetanic convulsions are present. When the\r\nanimal is confined in a small closed chamber, death takes place in about\r\na quarter of an hour.\r\n\r\n_On section_, the bronchial tubes, to the finest ramifications, are\r\nfound to be filled with a tenacious mucus, and the air passages, from\r\nthe glottis throughout, reddened. The lungs are emphysematous, but have\r\nnot always any special colour; the heart contains but little coagulated\r\nblood; the blood has a dark-red colour.\r\n\r\n§ 96. The chronic effects of the gas, as shown in workmen engaged in\r\nmanufactures in which the fumes of ammonia are frequent, appear to be an\r\ninflammation of the eyes and an affection of the skin. The latter is\r\nthought to be due to the ammonia uniting to form a soap with the oil of\r\nthe lubricating skin glands. Some observers have also noticed deafness,\r\nand a peculiar colour of the skin of the nose and forehead, among those\r\nwho work in guano manufactories. Its usual action on the body appears to\r\nbe a diminution of the healthy oxidation changes, and a general lowering\r\nof bodily strength, with evident anæmia.\r\n\r\n§ 97. =Ammonia in Solution.--Action on Plants.=--Solutions of strong\r\nammonia, or solutions of the carbonate, act injuriously on vegetable\r\nlife, while the neutral salts of ammonia are, on the contrary, excellent\r\nmanures. A 30 per cent. solution of ammonic carbonate kills most plants\r\nwithin an hour, and it is indifferent whether the whole plant is watered\r\nwith this solution, or whether it is applied only to the leaves. If,\r\nafter this watering of the plant with ammonic carbonate water, the\r\ninjurious salt is washed out as far as possible by distilled water, or\r\nby a weakly acidulated fluid, then the plant may recover, after having\r\nshed more or less of its leaves. These facts sufficiently explain the\r\ninjurious effects noticed when urine is applied direct to plants, for\r\nurine in a very short time becomes essentially a solution of ammonic\r\ncarbonate.\r\n\r\n§ 98. =Action on Human Beings and Animal Life.=--The violence of the\r\naction of caustic solutions of ammonia almost entirely depends on the\r\nstate of concentration.\r\n\r\nThe local action of the strong solution appears to be mainly the\r\nextraction of water and the saponifying of fat, making a soluble soap.\r\nOn delicate tissues it has, therefore, a destructive action; but S.\r\nSamuel[118] has shown that ammonia, when applied to the unbroken\r\nepidermis, does not have the same intense action as potash or soda, nor\r\ndoes it coagulate albumen. Blood, whether exposed to ammonia gas, or\r\nmixed with solution of ammonia, becomes immediately dark-red; then,\r\nlater, through destruction of the blood corpuscles, very dark, even\r\nblack; lastly, a dirty brown-red. The oxygen is expelled, the hæmoglobin\r\ndestroyed, and the blood corpuscles dissolved.\r\n\r\n[118] Virchow’s _Archiv f. path. Anat._, Bd. 51, Hft. 1 u. 2, S. 41,\r\n&c., 1870.\r\n\r\nThe albumen of the blood is changed to alkali-albuminate, and the blood\r\nitself will not coagulate. A more or less fluid condition of the blood\r\nhas always been noticed in the bodies of those poisoned by ammonia.\r\n\r\nBlood exposed to ammonia, when viewed by the spectroscope, shows the\r\nspectra of alkaline hæmatin, a weak absorption-band, in the\r\nneighbourhood of D; but if the blood has been acted on for some time by\r\nammonia, then all absorption-bands vanish. These spectra, however, are\r\nnot peculiar to ammonia, the action of caustic potash or soda being\r\nsimilar. The muscles are excited by ammonia, the functions of the nerves\r\nare destroyed.\r\n\r\nWhen a solution of strong ammonia is swallowed, there are two main\r\neffects--(1) the action of the ammonia itself on the tissues it comes\r\ninto contact with, and (2) the effects of the vapour on the\r\nair-passages. There are, therefore, immediate irritation, redness, and\r\nswelling of the tongue and pharynx, a burning pain reaching from the\r\nmouth to the stomach, with vomiting, and, it may be, nervous\r\nsymptoms. The saliva is notably increased. In a case reported by\r\nFonssagrives,[119] no less than 3 litres were expelled in the\r\ntwenty-four hours. Often the glands under the jaw and the lymphatics of\r\nthe neck are swollen.\r\n\r\n[119] _L’Union Médicale_, 1857, No. 13, p. 49, No. 22, p. 90.\r\n\r\nDoses of from 5 to 30 grammes of the strong solution of ammonia may kill\r\nas quickly as prussic acid. In a case recorded by Christison,[120] death\r\noccurred in four minutes from a large dose, doubtless partly by\r\nsuffocation. As sudden a result is also recorded by Plenk: a man, bitten\r\nby a rabid dog, took a mouthful of spirits of ammonia, and died in four\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\n[120] Christison, 167.\r\n\r\nIf death does not occur rapidly, there may be other symptoms--dependent\r\nnot upon its merely local action, but upon its more remote effects.\r\nThese mainly consist in an excitation of the brain and spinal cord, and,\r\nlater, convulsive movements deepening into loss of consciousness. It has\r\nbeen noticed that, with great relaxation of the muscular system, the\r\npatients complain of every movement causing pain. With these general\r\nsymptoms added to the local injury, death may follow many days after the\r\nswallowing of the fatal dose.\r\n\r\nDeath may also occur simply from the local injury done to the throat and\r\nlarynx, and the patient may linger some time. Thus, in a case quoted by\r\nTaylor,[121] in which none of the poison appears actually to have been\r\nswallowed, the man died nineteen days after taking the poison from\r\ninflammation of the throat and larynx. As with the strong acids, so with\r\nammonia and the alkalies generally, death may also be caused many weeks\r\nand even months afterwards from the effects of contraction of the\r\ngullet, or from the impaired nutrition consequent upon the destruction,\r\nmore or less, of portions of the stomach or intestinal canal.\r\n\r\n[121] _Principles of Jurisprudence_, i. p. 235.\r\n\r\n§ 99. =Post-mortem Appearances.=--In recent cases there is an intense\r\nredness of the intestinal canal, from the mouth to the stomach, and even\r\nbeyond, with here and there destruction of the mucous membrane, and even\r\nperforation. A wax preparation in the museum of University College (No.\r\n2378) shows the effects on the stomach produced by swallowing strong\r\nammonia; it is ashen-gray in colour, and most of the mucous membrane is,\r\nas it were, dissolved away; the cardiac end is much congested.\r\n\r\nThe contents of the stomach are usually coloured with blood; the\r\nbronchial tubes and glottis are almost constantly found inflamed--even a\r\ncroup-like (or diphtheritic) condition has been seen. Œdema of the\r\nglottis should also be looked for: in one case this alone seems to have\r\naccounted for death. The blood is of a clear-red colour, and fluid. A\r\nsmell of ammonia may be present.\r\n\r\nIf a sufficient time has elapsed for secondary effects to take place,\r\nthen there may be other appearances. Thus, in the case of a girl who,\r\nfalling into a fainting fit, was treated with a draught of undiluted\r\nspirits of ammonia, and lived four weeks afterwards, the stomach\r\n(preserved in St. George’s Hospital museum, 43 b, ser. ix.) is seen to\r\nbe much dilated and covered with cicatrices, and the pylorus is so\r\ncontracted as hardly to admit a small bougie. It has also been noticed\r\nthat there is generally a fatty degeneration of both the kidneys and\r\nliver.\r\n\r\nIt need scarcely be observed that, in such cases, no free ammonia will\r\nbe found, and the question of the cause of death must necessarily be\r\nwholly medical and pathological.\r\n\r\n§ 100. =Separation of Ammonia.=--Ammonia is separated in all cases by\r\ndistillation, and if the organic or other liquid is already alkaline,\r\nit is at once placed in a retort and distilled. If neutral or acid, a\r\nlittle burnt magnesia may be added until the reaction is alkaline. It is\r\ngenerally laid down that the contents of the stomach in a putrid\r\ncondition cannot be examined for ammonia, because ammonia is already\r\npresent as a product of decomposition; but even under these\r\ncircumstances it is possible to give an opinion whether ammonia _in\r\nexcess_ is present. For if, after carefully mixing the whole contents of\r\nthe stomach, and then drying a portion and reckoning from that weight\r\nthe total nitrogen (considering, for this purpose, the contents to\r\nconsist wholly of albumen, which yields about 16 per cent. of\r\nnitrogen)--under these conditions, the contents of the stomach yield\r\nmore than 16 per cent. of nitrogen as ammonia reckoned on the dry\r\nsubstance, it is tolerably certain that ammonia not derived from the\r\nfood or the tissues is present.\r\n\r\nIf, also, there is a sufficient evolution of ammonia to cause white\r\nfumes, when a rod moistened with hydrochloric acid is brought near to\r\nthe liquid, this is an effect never noticed with a normal decomposition,\r\nand renders the presence of extrinsic ammonia probable.\r\n\r\nAn alkaline-reacting distillate, which gives a brown colour with the\r\n“nessler” reagent, and which, when carefully neutralised with sulphuric\r\nacid, on evaporation to dryness by the careful heat of a water-bath,\r\nleaves a crystalline mass that gives a copious precipitate with platinic\r\nchloride, but is hardly at all soluble in absolute alcohol, can be no\r\nother substance than ammonia.\r\n\r\n§ 101. =Estimation.=--Ammonia is most quickly estimated by distilling,\r\nreceiving the distillate in decinormal acid, and then titrating back. It\r\nmay also be estimated as the double chloride of ammonium and platinum\r\n(NH₄Cl)₂PtCl₄. The distillate is exactly neutralised by HCl, evaporated\r\nto near dryness, and an alcoholic solution of platinic chloride added in\r\nsufficient quantity to be always in slight excess, as shown by the\r\nyellow colour of the supernatant fluid. The precipitate is collected,\r\nwashed with a little alcohol, dried, and weighed on a tared filter; 100\r\nparts of the salt are equal to 7·6 of NH₃.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.--Caustic Potash and Soda.\r\n\r\n§ 102. There is so little difference in the local effects produced by\r\npotash and soda respectively, that it will be convenient to treat them\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n=Potash= (=potassa caustica=).--Hydrate of potassium (KHO), atomic\r\nweight 56, specific gravity 2·1.\r\n\r\n=Properties.=--Pure hydrate of potassium is a compact, white solid,\r\nusually met with in the form of sticks. When heated to a temperature a\r\nlittle under redness, it melts to a nearly colourless liquid; in this\r\nstate it is intensely corrosive. It rapidly absorbs moisture from the\r\nair, and moist potash also absorbs with great avidity carbon dioxide; it\r\nis powerfully alkaline, changing red litmus to blue. It is soluble in\r\nhalf its weight of cold water, great heat being evolved during solution;\r\nit forms two definite hydrates--one, KHO + H₂O; the other, KHO + 2H₂O.\r\nIt is sparingly soluble in ether, but is dissolved by alcohol,\r\nwood-spirit, fusel oil, and glycerin.\r\n\r\n§ 103. =Pharmaceutical Preparations.=--Potassium hydrate, as well as the\r\nsolution of potash, is officinal in all pharmacopœias. The _liquor\r\npotassæ_, or solution of potash, of the British Pharmacopœia, is a\r\nstrongly alkaline, caustic liquid, of 1·058 specific gravity, and\r\ncontaining 5·84 per cent. by weight of KHO. It should, theoretically,\r\nnot effervesce, when treated with an acid, but its affinity for CO₂ is\r\nso great that all solutions of potash, which have been in any way\r\nexposed to air, contain a little carbonate. Caustic sticks of potash and\r\nlime used to be officinal in the British Pharmacopœia. Filho’s caustic\r\nis still in commerce, and is made by melting together two parts of\r\npotassium hydrate and one part of lime in an iron ladle or vessel; the\r\nmelted mass is now moulded by pouring it into leaden moulds. Vienna\r\npaste is composed of equal weights of potash and lime made into a paste\r\nwith rectified spirit or glycerin.\r\n\r\n§ 104. =Carbonate of Potash= (K₂CO₃ + 1½H₂O), when pure, is in the form\r\nof small white crystalline grains, alkaline in taste and reaction, and\r\nrapidly deliquescing when exposed to moist air; it gives all the\r\nchemical reactions of potassium oxide, and carbon dioxide. Carbonate of\r\npotash, under the name of _salt of tartar_, or potashes, is sold by\r\noilmen for cleansing purposes. They supply it either in a fairly pure\r\nstate, or as a darkish moist mass containing many impurities.\r\n\r\n§ 105. =Bicarbonate of Potash= (KHCO₃) is in the form of large\r\ntransparent rhombic prisms, and is not deliquescent. The effervescing\r\nsolution of potash (_liquor potassæ effervescens_) consists of 30 grains\r\nof KHCO₃ in a pint of water (3·45 grms. per litre), and as much CO₂ as\r\nthe water will take up under a pressure of seven atmospheres.\r\n\r\n§ 106. =Caustic Soda--Sodium Hydrate= (NaHO).--This substance is a white\r\nsolid, very similar in appearance to potassium hydrate; it absorbs\r\nmoisture from the air, and afterwards carbon dioxide, becoming solid\r\nagain, for the carbonate is not deliquescent. In this respect, then,\r\nthere is a great difference between potash and soda, for the former is\r\ndeliquescent both as hydrate and carbonate; a stick of potash in a\r\nsemi-liquid state, by exposure to the air, continues liquid, although\r\nsaturated with carbon dioxide. Pure sodium hydrate has a specific\r\ngravity of 2·0; it dissolves in water with evolution of heat, and the\r\nsolution gives all the reactions of sodium hydrate, and absorbs carbon\r\ndioxide as readily as the corresponding solution of potash. The _liquor\r\nsodæ_ of the B.P. should contain 4·1 per cent. of NaHO.\r\n\r\n§ 107. =Sodæ Carbonas--Carbonate of Soda=--(Na₂CO₃10H₂O).--The pure\r\ncarbonate of soda for medicinal use is in colourless and transparent\r\nrhombic octahedrons; when exposed to air, the crystals effloresce and\r\ncrumble. The _sodæ carbonas exsiccata_, or dried carbonate of soda, is\r\nsimply the ordinary carbonate, deprived of its water of crystallisation,\r\nwhich amounts to 62·93 per cent.\r\n\r\n§ 108. =Bicarbonate of Soda= (NaHCO₃) occurs in the form of minute\r\ncrystals, or, more commonly, as a white powder. The _liquor sodæ\r\neffervescens_ of the B.P. is a solution of the bicarbonate, 30 grains of\r\nthe salt in 20 ozs. of water (3·45 grms. per litre), the water being\r\ncharged with as much carbonic acid as it will hold under a pressure of\r\nseven atmospheres. _The bicarbonate of soda lozenges_ (_trochisci sodæ\r\nbicarbonatis_) contain in each lozenge 5 grains (327 mgrms.) of the\r\nbicarbonate. The carbonate of soda sold for household purposes is of two\r\nkinds--the one, “seconds,” of a dirty white colour and somewhat impure;\r\nthe other, “best,” is a white mass of much greater purity. _Javelle\r\nwater_ (_Eau de Javelle_) is a solution of hypochlorite of soda; its\r\naction is poisonous, more from the caustic alkali than from the\r\nchlorine, and may, therefore, be here included.\r\n\r\n§ 109. =Statistics.=--Poisoning by the fixed alkalies is not so frequent\r\nas poisoning by ammonia. Falck has collected, from medical literature,\r\n27 cases, 2 of which were the criminal administering of _Eau de\r\nJavelle_, and 5 were suicidal; 22, or 81·5 per cent., died--in 1 of the\r\ncases after twenty-four hours; in the others, life was prolonged for\r\ndays, weeks, or months--in 1 case for twenty-seven months. In the ten\r\nyears 1883-1892, in England and Wales, there were 27 deaths from\r\npoisoning by the fixed alkalies; 2 were suicidal (1 from potash, the\r\nother from soda); the remaining 25 were due to accident; of these, 7 (3\r\nmales and 4 females) were from caustic soda, and 18 (8 males and 10\r\nfemales) from caustic potash.\r\n\r\n§ 110. =Effects on Animal and Vegetable Life.=--The fixed alkalies\r\ndestroy all vegetable life, if applied in strong solution or in\r\nsubstance, by dehydrating and dissolving the tissues. The effects on\r\nanimal tissues are, in part, due also to the affinity of the alkalies\r\nfor water. They extract water from the tissues with which they come in\r\ncontact, and also attack the albuminous constituents, forming\r\nalkali-albuminate, which swells on the addition of water, and, in a\r\nlarge quantity, even dissolves. Cartilaginous and horny tissues are also\r\nacted upon, and strong alkalies will dissolve hair, silk, &c. The action\r\nof the alkali is by no means restricted to the part first touched, but\r\nhas a remarkable faculty of spreading in all directions.\r\n\r\n§ 111. =Local Effects.=--The effects of strong alkali applied to the\r\nepidermis are similar to, but not identical with, those produced by\r\nstrong acids. S. Samuel[122] has studied this experimentally on the ear\r\nof the rabbit; a drop of a strong solution of caustic alkali, placed on\r\nthe ear of a white rabbit, caused stasis in the arteries and veins, with\r\nfirst a greenish, then a black colour of the blood; the epidermis was\r\nbleached, the hair loosened, and there quickly followed a greenish\r\ncoloration on the back of the ear, opposite to the place of application.\r\nAround the burned spot appeared a circle of anastomising vessels, a\r\nblister rose, and a slough separated in a few days. The whole thickness\r\nof the ear was coloured yellowish-green, and, later, the spot became of\r\na rusty brown.\r\n\r\n[122] Virchow’s _Archiv. f. path. Anat._, Bd. 51, Hft. 1 u. 2, 1870.\r\n\r\n§ 112. =Symptoms.=--The symptoms observed when a person has swallowed a\r\ndangerous dose of caustic (fixed) alkali are very similar to those\r\nnoticed with ammonia, with the important exception that there is no\r\nrespiratory trouble, unless the liquid has come into contact with the\r\nglottis; nor has there been hitherto remarked the rapid death which has\r\ntaken place in a few ammonia poisonings, the shortest time hitherto\r\nrecorded being three hours, as related by Taylor, in a case in which a\r\nboy had swallowed 3 ozs. of a strong solution of carbonate of potash.\r\n\r\nThere is instant pain, extending from the mouth to the stomach, and a\r\npersistent and unpleasant taste; if the individual is not a determined\r\nsuicide, and the poison (as is mostly the case) has been taken\r\naccidentally, the liquid is immediately ejected as much as possible, and\r\nwater, or other liquid at hand, drunk freely. Shock may at once occur,\r\nand the patient die from collapse; but this, even with frightful\r\ndestruction of tissue, appears to be rare. Vomiting supervenes; what is\r\nejected is strongly alkaline, and streaked with blood, and has a soapy,\r\nfrothy appearance. There may be diarrhœa, great tenderness of the\r\nabdomen, and quick pulse and fever. With caustic potash, there may be\r\nalso noticed its toxic effects (apart from local action) on the heart;\r\nthe pulse, in that case, is slow and weak, and loss of consciousness and\r\nconvulsions are not uncommon. If the collapse and after-inflammation are\r\nrecovered from, then, as in the case of the mineral acids, there is all\r\nthe horrid sequence of symptoms pointing to contractions and strictures\r\nof the gullet or pylorus, and the subsequent dyspepsia, difficulty of\r\nswallowing, and not unfrequently actual starvation.\r\n\r\n§ 113. =Post-mortem Appearances.=--In cases of recent poisoning, spots\r\non the cheeks, lips, clothing, &c., giving evidence of the contact of\r\nthe alkali, should be looked for; but this evidence, in the case of\r\npersons who have lived a few days, may be wanting. The mucous membrane\r\nof the mouth, throat, gullet, and stomach is generally more or less\r\nwhite--here and there denuded, and will be found in various stages of\r\ninflammation and erosion, according to the amount taken, and the\r\nconcentration of the alkali. Where there is erosion, the base of the\r\neroded parts is not brown-yellow, but, as a rule, pale red. The gullet\r\nis most affected at its lower part, and it is this part which is mostly\r\nsubject to stricture. Thus Böhm[123] found that in 18 cases of\r\ncontraction of the gullet, collected by him, 10 of the 18 showed the\r\ncontraction at the lower third.\r\n\r\n[123] _Centralblatt für die Med. Wiss._, 1874.\r\n\r\nThe changes which the stomach may present if the patient has lived some\r\ntime, are well illustrated by a preparation in St. George’s museum (43\r\na. 264, ser. ix.). It is the stomach of a woman, aged 44, who had\r\nswallowed a concentrated solution of carbonate of potash. She vomited\r\nimmediately after taking it, and lived about two months, during the\r\nlatter part of which she had to be nourished by injections. She died\r\nmainly from starvation. The gullet in its lower part is seen to be much\r\ncontracted, its lining membrane destroyed, and the muscular coats\r\nexposed. The coats of the stomach are thickened, but what chiefly\r\narrests the attention is a dense cicatrix at the pylorus, with an\r\naperture so small as only to admit a probe.\r\n\r\nThe colour of the stomach is generally bright red, but in that of a\r\nchild, preserved in Guy’s Hospital museum (No. 1798²⁴), the mucous\r\nmembrane is obliterated, the rugæ destroyed, and a dark-brown stain is a\r\nnoticeable feature. The stomach is not, however, necessarily affected.\r\nIn a preparation in the same museum (No. 1798²⁰) the mucous membrane of\r\nthe stomach of a child who swallowed soap-lees is seen to be almost\r\nhealthy, but the gullet is much discoloured. The action on the blood is\r\nto change it into a gelatinous mass; the blood corpuscles are destroyed,\r\nand the whole colour becomes of a dirty blackish-red; the spectroscopic\r\nappearances are identical with those already described (see p. 114).\r\n\r\nThe question as to the effects of chronic poisoning by the alkalies or\r\ntheir carbonates may arise. Little or nothing is, however, known of the\r\naction of considerable quantities of alkalies taken daily. In a case\r\nrelated by Dr. Tunstall,[124] a man for eighteen years had taken daily 2\r\nozs. of bicarbonate of soda for the purpose of relieving indigestion. He\r\ndied suddenly, and the stomach was found extensively diseased; but since\r\nthe man, before taking the alkali, had complained of pain, &c., it is\r\nhardly well, from this one case, to draw any conclusion.\r\n\r\n[124] _Med. Times_, Nov. 30, 1850, p. 564.\r\n\r\nIt is important to observe that the contents of the stomach may be acid,\r\nalthough the death has been produced by caustic alkali. A child, aged 4,\r\ndrank from a cup some 14 per cent. soda lye. He vomited frequently, and\r\ndied in fifteen hours. The stomach contained 80 c.c. of sour-smelling\r\nturbid fluid, the reaction of which was acid. There were hæmorrhagic\r\npatches in the stomach, and signs of catarrhal inflammation; there was\r\nalso a similarly inflamed condition of the duodenum.[125]\r\n\r\n[125] Lesser, _Atlas d. gericht. Med._, Tafel ii.\r\n\r\n§ 114. =Chemical Analysis.=--The tests for potassium or sodium are too\r\nwell known to need more than enumeration. The intense yellow flame\r\nproduced when a sodium salt is submitted to a Bunsen flame, and the\r\nbright sodium-line at D when viewed by the spectroscope, is a delicate\r\ntest; while potassium gives a dull red band in the red, and a faint but\r\nvery distinct line in the violet. Potassium salts are precipitated by\r\ntartaric acid, while sodium salts do not yield this precipitate;\r\npotassium salts also give a precipitate with platinic chloride insoluble\r\nin strong alcohol, while the compound salt with sodium is rapidly\r\ndissolved by alcohol or water. This fact is utilised in the separation\r\nand estimation of the two alkalies.\r\n\r\n§ 115. =Estimation of the Fixed Alkalies.=--To detect a fixed alkali in\r\nthe contents of the stomach, a convenient process is to proceed by\r\ndialysis, and after twenty-four hours, to concentrate the outer liquid\r\nby boiling, and then, if it is not too much coloured, to titrate\r\ndirectly with a decinormal sulphuric acid. After exact neutralisation,\r\nthe liquid is evaporated to dryness, carbonised, the alkaline salts\r\nlixiviated out with water, the sulphuric acid exactly precipitated by\r\nbaric chloride, and then, after separation of the sulphate, the liquid\r\ntreated with milk of lime. The filtrate is treated with a current of CO₂\r\ngas, boiled, and any precipitate filtered off; the final filtrate will\r\ncontain only alkalies. The liquid may now be evaporated to dryness with\r\neither hydrochloric or sulphuric acids, and the total alkalies weighed\r\nas sulphates or chlorides. Should it be desirable to know exactly the\r\nproportion of potassium to sodium, it is best to convert the alkalies\r\ninto chlorides--dry gently, ignite, and weigh; then dissolve in the\r\nleast possible quantity of water, and precipitate by platinic chloride,\r\nwhich should be added so as to be a little in excess, but not much. The\r\nliquid thus treated is evaporated nearly to dryness, and then extracted\r\nwith alcohol of 80 per cent., which dissolves out any of the double\r\nchloride of platinum and sodium. Finally, the precipitate is collected\r\non a tared filter and weighed, after drying at 100°. In this way the\r\nanalyst both distinguishes between the salts of sodium and potassium,\r\nand estimates the relative quantities of each. It is hardly necessary to\r\nobserve that, if the double chloride is wholly soluble in water or\r\nalcohol, sodium alone is present. This, however, will never occur in\r\noperating on organic tissues and fluids, for both alkalies are\r\ninvariably present. A correction must be made when complex organic\r\nfluids are in this way treated for alkalies which may be naturally in\r\nthe fluid. Here the analyst will be guided by his preliminary\r\ntitration, which gives the total free alkalinity. In cases where the\r\nalkali has been neutralised by acids, of course no free alkali will be\r\nfound, but the corresponding salt.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.--Neutral Sodium, Potassium, and Ammonium Salts.\r\n\r\n    § 116. The neutral salts of the alkalies are poisonous, if\r\n    administered in sufficient doses, and the poisonous effect of the\r\n    sulphate, chloride, bromide, iodide, tartrate, and citrate appears\r\n    to depend on the specific action of the alkali metal, rather than on\r\n    the acid, or halogen in combination. According to the researches of\r\n    Dr. Ringer and Dr. Harrington Sainsbury,[126] with regard to the\r\n    relative toxicity of the three, as shown by their effect on the\r\n    heart of a frog--first, the potassium salts were found to exert the\r\n    most poisonous action, next come the ammonium, and, lastly, the\r\n    sodium salts. The highest estimate would be that sodium salts are\r\n    only one-tenth as poisonous as those of ammonium or potassium; the\r\n    lowest, that the sodium salts are one-fifth: although the\r\n    experiments mainly throw light upon the action of the alkalies on\r\n    one organ only, yet the indications obtained probably hold good for\r\n    the organism as a whole, and are pretty well borne out by clinical\r\n    experience.\r\n\r\n[126] _Lancet_, June 24, 1882.\r\n\r\n    There appear to be four cases on record of poisoning by the above\r\n    neutral salts; none of them belong to recent times, but lie between\r\n    the years 1837-1856. Hence, the main knowledge which we possess of\r\n    the poisonous action of the potassium salts is derived from\r\n    experiments on animals.\r\n\r\n    § 117. =Sodium Salts.=--Common salt in such enormous quantity as\r\n    half a pound to a pound has destroyed human life, but these cases\r\n    are so exceptional that the poisonous action of sodium salts is of\r\n    scientific rather than practical interest.\r\n\r\n    § 118. =Potassium Salts.=--Leaving for future consideration the\r\n    nitrate and the chlorate of potassium, potassic sulphate and\r\n    tartrate are substances which have destroyed human life.\r\n\r\n    =Potassic Sulphate= (K₂SO₄) is in the form of colourless rhombic\r\n    crystals, of bitter saline taste. It is soluble in 10 parts of\r\n    water.\r\n\r\n    =Hydropotassic Tartrate= (KHC₄H₄O₆), when pure, is in the form of\r\n    rhombic crystals, tasting feebly acid. It is soluble in 210 parts of\r\n    water at 17°.\r\n\r\n    § 119. =Action on the Frog’s Heart.=--Both excitability and\r\n    contractility are affected to a powerful degree. There is a\r\n    remarkable slowing of the pulsations, irregularity, and, lastly,\r\n    cessation of pulsation altogether.\r\n\r\n    § 120. =Action on Warm-Blooded Animals.=--If a sufficient quantity\r\n    of a solution of a potassic salt is injected into the blood-vessels\r\n    of an animal, there is almost immediate death from arrest of the\r\n    heart’s action. Smaller doses, subcutaneously applied, produce\r\n    slowing of the pulse, dyspnœa, and convulsions, ending in death.\r\n    Small doses produce a transitory diminution of the force of arterial\r\n    pressure, which quickly passes, and the blood-pressure rises. There\r\n    is at first, for a few seconds, increase in the number of\r\n    pulsations, but later a remarkable slowing of the pulse. The rise in\r\n    the blood-pressure occurs even after section of the spinal cord.\r\n    Somewhat larger doses cause rapid lowering of the blood-pressure,\r\n    and apparent cessation of the heart’s action; but if the thorax be\r\n    then opened, the heart is seen to be contracting regularly, making\r\n    some 120-160 rhythmic movements in the minute. If the respiration be\r\n    now artificially maintained, and suitable pressure made on the walls\r\n    of the chest, so as to empty the heart of blood, the blood-pressure\r\n    quickly rises, and natural respiration may follow. An animal which\r\n    lay thirty-six minutes apparently dead was in this way brought to\r\n    life again (_Böhm_). The action of the salts of potassium on the\r\n    blood is the same as that of sodium salts. The blood is coloured a\r\n    brighter red, and the form of the corpuscles changed; they become\r\n    shrivelled through loss of water. Voluntary muscle loses quickly its\r\n    contractility when a solution of potash is injected into its\r\n    vessels. Nerves also, when treated with a 1 per cent. solution of\r\n    potassic chloride, become inexcitable.\r\n\r\n    § 121. =Elimination.=--The potassium salts appear to leave the body\r\n    through the kidneys, but are excreted much more slowly than the\r\n    corresponding sodium salts. Thus, after injection of 4 grms. of\r\n    potassic chloride--in the first sixteen hours ·748 grm. of KCl was\r\n    excreted in the urine, and in the following twenty-four hours 2·677\r\n    grms.\r\n\r\n    § 122. =Nitrate of Potash= (KNO₃).--Pure potassic nitrate\r\n    crystallises in large anhydrous hexagonal prisms with dihedral\r\n    summits; it does not absorb water, and does not deliquesce. Its\r\n    fusing point is about 340°; when melted it forms a transparent\r\n    liquid, and loses a little of its oxygen, but this is for the most\r\n    part retained by the liquid given off when the salt solidifies. At a\r\n    red-heat it evolves oxygen, and is reduced first to nitrite; if the\r\n    heat is continued, potassic oxide remains. The specific gravity of\r\n    the fused salt is 2·06. It is not very soluble in cold water, 100\r\n    parts dissolving only 26 at 15·6°; but boiling water dissolves it\r\n    freely, 100 parts dissolving 240 of the salt.\r\n\r\n    A solution of nitrate of potash, when treated with a zinc couple\r\n    (see “Foods,” p. 566), is decomposed, the nitrate being first\r\n    reduced to nitrite, as shown by its striking a red colour with\r\n    metaphenylene-diamine, and then the nitrite farther decomposing, and\r\n    ammonia appearing in the liquid. If the solution is alkalised, and\r\n    treated with aluminium foil, hydrogen is evolved, and the same\r\n    effect produced. As with all nitrates, potassic nitrate, on being\r\n    heated in a test-tube with a little water, some copper filings, and\r\n    sulphuric acid, evolves red fumes of nitric peroxide.\r\n\r\n    § 123. =Statistics.=--Potassic nitrate, under the popular name of\r\n    “_nitre_,” is a very common domestic remedy, and is also largely\r\n    used as a medicine for cattle. There appear to be twenty cases of\r\n    potassic nitrate poisoning on record--of these, eight were caused by\r\n    the salts having been accidentally mistaken for magnesic sulphate,\r\n    sodic sulphate, or other purgative salt; two cases were due to a\r\n    similar mistake for common salt. In one instance, the nitrate was\r\n    used in strong solution as an enema, but most of the cases were due\r\n    to the taking of too large an internal dose.\r\n\r\n    § 124. =Uses in the Arts=, &c.--Both sodic and potassic nitrates are\r\n    called “nitre” by the public indiscriminately. Sodic nitrate is\r\n    imported in large quantities from the rainless districts of Peru as\r\n    a manure. Potassic nitrate is much used in the manufacture of\r\n    gunpowder, in the preservation of animal substances, in the\r\n    manufacture of gun cotton, of sulphuric and nitric acids, &c. The\r\n    maximum medicinal dose of potassium nitrate is usually stated to be\r\n    30 grains (1·9 grm.).\r\n\r\n    § 125. =Action of Nitrates of Sodium and Potassium.=--Both of these\r\n    salts are poisonous. Potassic nitrate has been taken with fatal\r\n    result by man; the poisonous nature of sodic nitrate is established\r\n    by experiments on animals. The action of the nitrates of the\r\n    alkalies is separated from that of the other neutral salts of\r\n    potassium, &c., because in this case the toxic action of the\r\n    combined nitric acid plays no insignificant part. Large doses, 3-5\r\n    grms. (46·3-77·2 grains), of potassic nitrate cause considerable\r\n    uneasiness in the stomach and bowels; the digestion is disturbed;\r\n    there may be vomiting and diarrhœa, and there is generally present a\r\n    desire to urinate frequently. Still larger doses, 15-30 grms.\r\n    (231·5-463 grains), rapidly produce all the symptoms of acute\r\n    gastro-enteritis--great pain, frequent vomiting (the ejected matters\r\n    being often bloody), with irregularity and slowing of the pulse;\r\n    weakness, cold sweats, painful cramps in single muscles (especially\r\n    in the calves of the legs); and, later, convulsions, aphonia, quick\r\n    collapse, and death.\r\n\r\n    In the case of a pregnant woman, a handful of “nitre” taken in\r\n    mistake for Glauber’s salts produced abortion after half-an-hour.\r\n    The woman recovered. Sodic nitrate subcutaneously applied to frogs\r\n    kills them, in doses of ·026 grm. (·4 grain), in about two hours;\r\n    there are fibrillar twitchings of single groups of muscles and\r\n    narcosis. The heart dies last, but after ceasing to beat may, by a\r\n    stimulus, be made again to contract. Rabbits, poisoned similarly by\r\n    sodic nitrate, exhibit also narcotic symptoms; they lose\r\n    consciousness, lie upon their side, and respond only to the sharpest\r\n    stimuli. The breathing, as well as the heart, is “slowed,” and death\r\n    follows after a few spasmodic inspirations.\r\n\r\n    =Sodic nitrite= was found by Barth to be a more powerful poison,\r\n    less than 6 mgrms. (·1 grain) being sufficient to kill a rabbit of\r\n    455·5 grms. (7028 grains) weight, when subcutaneously injected. The\r\n    symptoms were very similar to those produced by the nitrate.\r\n\r\n    § 126. The _post-mortem_ appearances from potassic nitrate are as\r\n    follows:--An inflamed condition of the stomach, with the mucous\r\n    membrane dark in colour, and readily tearing; the contents of the\r\n    stomach are often mixed with blood. In a case related by Orfila,\r\n    there was even a small perforation by a large dose of potassic\r\n    nitrate, and a remarkable preservation of the body was noted.\r\n\r\n    It is believed that the action of the nitrates is to be partly\r\n    explained by a reduction to nitrites, circulating in the blood as\r\n    such. To detect nitrites in the blood, the best method is to place\r\n    the blood in a dialyser, the outer liquid being alcohol. The\r\n    alcoholic solution may be evaporated to dryness, extracted with\r\n    water, and then tested by metaphenylene-diamine.\r\n\r\n    § 127. =Potassic Chlorate= (KClO₃).--Potassic chlorate is in the\r\n    form of colourless, tabular crystals with four or six sides. About 6\r\n    parts of the salt are dissolved by 100 of water at 15°, the\r\n    solubility increasing with the temperature, so that at 100° nearly\r\n    60 parts dissolve; if strong sulphuric acid be dropped on the\r\n    crystals, peroxide of chlorine is evolved; when rubbed with sulphur\r\n    in a mortar, potassic chlorate detonates. When the salt is heated\r\n    strongly, it first melts, and then decomposes, yielding oxygen gas,\r\n    and is transformed into the perchlorate. If the heat is continued,\r\n    this also is decomposed, and the final result is potassic chloride.\r\n\r\n    § 128. =Uses.=--Potassic chlorate is largely used as an oxidiser in\r\n    calico printing, and in dyeing, especially in the preparation of\r\n    aniline black. A considerable quantity is consumed in the\r\n    manufacture of lucifer matches and fireworks; it is also a\r\n    convenient source of oxygen. Detonators for exploding dynamite are\r\n    mixtures of fulminate of mercury and potassic chlorate. It is\r\n    employed as a medicine both as an application to inflamed mucous\r\n    membranes, and for internal administration; about 2000 tons of the\r\n    salt for these various purposes are manufactured yearly in the\r\n    United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n    § 129. =Poisonous Properties.=--The facility with which potassic\r\n    chlorate parts with its oxygen by the aid of heat, led to its very\r\n    extensive employment in medicine. No drug, indeed, has been given\r\n    more recklessly, or on a less scientific basis. Wherever there were\r\n    sloughing wounds, low fevers, and malignant sore throats, especially\r\n    those of a diphtheritic character, the practitioner administered\r\n    potassic chlorate in colossal doses. If the patient died, it was\r\n    ascribed to the malignity of the disease--if he recovered, to the\r\n    oxygen of the salt; and it is possible, from the light which of\r\n    recent years has been thrown on the action of potassic chlorate,\r\n    that its too reckless use has led to many unrecorded accidents.\r\n\r\n    § 130. =Experiments on Animals.=--F. Marchand[127] has studied the\r\n    effects of potassic chlorate on animals, and on blood. If either\r\n    potassic chlorate or sodic chlorate is mixed with fresh blood, it\r\n    shows after a little while peculiar changes; the clear red colour at\r\n    first produced passes, within a few hours, into a dark red-brown,\r\n    which gradually becomes pure brown. This change is produced by a 1\r\n    per cent. solution, in from fifteen to sixteen hours; and a 4 per\r\n    cent. solution at 15° destroys every trace of oxyhæmoglobin within\r\n    four hours. Soon the blood takes a syrupy consistence, and, with a\r\n    2-4 per cent. solution of the salt, passes into a jelly-like mass.\r\n    The jelly has much permanence, and resists putrefactive changes for\r\n    a long time.\r\n\r\n[127] _Virchow’s Archiv. f. path. Anat._, Bd. 77, Hft. 3, S. 455, 1879.\r\n\r\n    Marchand fed a dog of 17 kilos. in weight with 5 grms. of potassic\r\n    chlorate for a week. As there were no apparent symptoms, the dose\r\n    was doubled for two days; and as there was still no visible effect,\r\n    lastly, 50 grms. of sodic chlorate were given in 5 doses. In the\r\n    following night the dog died. The blood was found after death to be\r\n    of a sepia-brown colour, and remained unaltered when exposed to the\r\n    air. The organs were generally of an unnatural brown colour; the\r\n    spleen was enormously enlarged; the kidneys were swollen, and of a\r\n    dark chocolate brown--on section, almost black-brown, the colour\r\n    being nearly equal, both in the substance and in the capsule. A\r\n    microscopical examination of the kidney showed the canaliculi to be\r\n    filled with brownish cylinders consisting of altered blood. A\r\n    spectroscopic examination of the blood showed weak hæmoglobin bands,\r\n    and a narrow band in the red. With farther dilution, the hæmoglobin\r\n    bands vanished, but the band in the red remained. The diluted blood,\r\n    when exposed to the light, still remained of a coffee-brown colour;\r\n    and on shaking, a white-brown froth was produced on the surface.\r\n\r\n    A second experiment in which a hound of from 7-8 kilos. in weight\r\n    was given 3-5 grm. doses of potassic chlorate in sixteen hours, and\r\n    killed by bleeding seven to eight hours after the last dose, showed\r\n    very similar appearances. The kidneys were intensely congested, and\r\n    the peculiar brown colour was noticeable.\r\n\r\n    § 131. =Effects on Man.=--I find in literature thirty-nine cases\r\n    recorded, in which poisonous symptoms were directly ascribed to the\r\n    action of chlorate of potassium; twenty-eight of these terminated\r\n    fatally. A quadruple instance of poisoning, recorded by Brouardel\r\n    and L’Hôte,[128] illustrates many of the points relative to the time\r\n    at which the symptoms may be expected to commence, and the general\r\n    aspect of potassic chlorate poisoning. The “_supérieure_” of a\r\n    religious institution was in the habit of giving, for charitable\r\n    purposes, a potion containing 15 grms. (3·8 drms.) of potassic\r\n    chlorate, dissolved in 360 c.c. (about 12½ ozs.) of a vegetable\r\n    infusion.\r\n\r\n[128] _Annales d’Hygiène publique_, 1881, p. 232.\r\n\r\n    This potion was administered to four children--viz., David, aged 2½;\r\n    Cousin, aged 3½; Salmont, 2½; and Guérin, 2½. David took the whole\r\n    in two and a half hours, the symptoms commenced after the potion was\r\n    finished, and the child died five and a half hours after taking the\r\n    first dose; there were vomiting and diarrhœa. Cousin took the\r\n    medicine in seven hours; the symptoms also commenced after the last\r\n    spoonful, and the death took place eight and a half hours from the\r\n    first spoonful. The symptoms were mainly those of great depression;\r\n    the lips were blue, the pulse feeble, there was no vomiting, no\r\n    diarrhœa. Salmont took the medicine in nine hours, and died in\r\n    twelve. There was some diarrhœa, the stools were of a green colour.\r\n    Guérin took the whole in two hours, the symptoms commenced in four\r\n    hours; the lips were very pale, the gums blue. Death took place in\r\n    four days.\r\n\r\n    There was an autopsy in the case of David only. The stomach showed a\r\n    large ecchymosis on its mucous membrane, as if it had been burnt by\r\n    an acid; the spleen was gorged with blood, and its tissue friable;\r\n    the kidneys do not seem to have been thoroughly examined, but are\r\n    said to have been tumefied. Potassic chlorate was discovered by\r\n    dialysis. In the cases of the children just detailed, the symptoms\r\n    appear to be a mixture of the depressing action of the potassium,\r\n    and irritant action of the chlorate.\r\n\r\n    § 132. In adults, the main symptoms are those of nephritis, and the\r\n    fatal dose for an adult is somewhere about an ounce (28·3 grms.),\r\n    but half this quantity would probably be dangerous, especially if\r\n    given to a person who had congestion or disease of the kidneys.\r\n\r\n    Dr. Jacobi[129] gives the following cases.\r\n\r\n[129] _Amer. Med. Times_, 1860.\r\n\r\n    Dr. Fountain in 1858, experimenting on himself, took 29·2 grms. (8·7\r\n    drms.) of potassic chlorate; he died on the seventh day from\r\n    nephritis. A young lady swallowed 30 grms. (8·5 drms.), when using\r\n    it as a gargle; she died in a few days from nephritis. A man, thirty\r\n    years of age, died in four days after having taken 48 grms. (12·3\r\n    drms.) of sodic chlorate in six hours. The _shortest time_ in which\r\n    I can find the salt to have been fatal, is a case related by Dr.\r\n    Manouvriez, in which a woman took 45 grms., and died in five hours.\r\n    The _smallest dose_ which has proved fatal is one in which an infant\r\n    three years old was killed by 3 grms. (46·3 grains).\r\n\r\n    Jacobi considers that the maximum dose to be given in divided doses\r\n    during the twenty-four hours, to infants under three, should be from\r\n    1-1·5 grm. (15·4-23·1 grains), to children from three years old, up\r\n    to 2 grms. (30·8 grains); and adults from 6-8 grms. (92·6-123·4\r\n    grains).\r\n\r\n    § 133. =Elimination.=--Potassic chlorate is quickly absorbed by\r\n    mucous membranes, and by the inflamed skin, and rapidly separated\r\n    from the body by the action of the kidneys. Wöhler, as early as\r\n    1824, recognised that it in great part passed out of the body\r\n    unchanged, and, lately, Isambert, in conjunction with Hirne,[130]\r\n    making quantitative estimations, recovered from the urine no less\r\n    than 95 per cent. of the ingested salts. Otto Hehner has also made\r\n    several auto-experiments, and taking 2½ drms., found that it could\r\n    be detected in the urine an hour and a half afterwards. At that time\r\n    17·23 per cent. of the salt had been excreted, and, by the end of\r\n    eleven hours, 93·8 per cent. was recovered. It is then difficult to\r\n    believe that the salt gives any oxygen to the tissues, for though it\r\n    is true that in all the investigations a small percentage remains to\r\n    be accounted for, and also that Binz,[131] making experiments by\r\n    mixing solutions of potassic chlorate with moist organic substances,\r\n    such as pus, yeast, fibrin, &c., has declared that, at a blood heat\r\n    the chlorate is rapidly reduced, and is no longer recognisable as\r\n    chlorate--yet it may be affirmed that potassic chlorate is recovered\r\n    from the urine as completely as anything which is ever excreted by\r\n    the body, and that deductions drawn from the changes undergone by\r\n    the salt in solutions of fibrin, &c., have only an indirect bearing\r\n    on the question.\r\n\r\n[130] _Gaz. Méd. de Paris_, 1875, Nro. 17, 35, 41, 43.\r\n\r\n[131] _Berlin klin. Wochenschr._, xi. 10, S. 119, 1874.\r\n\r\n    § 134. The essential action of potassic chlorate seems to be that it\r\n    causes a peculiar change in the blood, acting on the colouring\r\n    matter and corpuscles; the latter lose their property as oxygen\r\n    carriers; the hæmoglobin is in part destroyed; the corpuscles\r\n    dissolved. The decomposed and altered blood-corpuscles are crowded\r\n    into the kidneys, spleen, &c.; they block up the uriniferous\r\n    canaliculi, and thus the organs present the curious colouring seen\r\n    after death, and the kidneys become inflamed.\r\n\r\n\r\nDetection and Estimation of Potassic Chlorate.\r\n\r\n    § 135. Organic fluids are best submitted to dialysis; the dialysed\r\n    fluid should then be concentrated and qualitative tests applied. One\r\n    of the best tests for the presence of a chlorate is, without doubt,\r\n    that recommended by Fresenius. The fluid to be tested is acidulated\r\n    with a few drops of sulphuric acid; sulphate of indigo added\r\n    sufficient to colour the solution blue, and finally a few drops of\r\n    sulphurous acid. In presence of potassic or sodic chlorate, the blue\r\n    colour immediately vanishes. This method is capable of detecting 1\r\n    part in 128,000; provided the solution is not originally coloured,\r\n    and but little organic matter is present.\r\n\r\n    The urine can be examined direct, but if it contain albumen, the\r\n    blue colour may disappear and yet chlorate be present; if too much\r\n    sulphurous acid be also added, the test may give erroneous results.\r\n    These are but trivial objections, however, for if the analyst\r\n    obtains a response to the test, he will naturally confirm or\r\n    disprove it by the following process:--\r\n\r\n    The liquid under examination, organic or otherwise, is divided into\r\n    two equal parts. In the one, all the chlorine present is\r\n    precipitated as chloride by silver nitrate in the usual way, and the\r\n    chloride of silver collected and weighed. In the other, the liquid\r\n    is evaporated to dryness and well charred by a dull red heat, the\r\n    ash dissolved in weak nitric acid, and the chlorides estimated as in\r\n    the first case. If chlorates were present, there will be a\r\n    difference between the two estimations, proportionate to the amount\r\n    of chlorates which have been converted into chlorides by the\r\n    carbonisation, and the first silver chloride subtracted from the\r\n    second will give an argentic chloride which is to be referred to\r\n    chlorate. In this way also the amount present may be quantitatively\r\n    estimated, 100 parts of silver chloride equalling 85·4 of potassic\r\n    chlorate.\r\n\r\n\r\nToxicological Detection of Alkali Salts.\r\n\r\n(See also _ante_, p. 121.)\r\n\r\n    § 136. Sodium, in combination, especially with chlorine, and also\r\n    with sulphuric, carbonic, and phosphoric acids, is found in the\r\n    plasma of the blood, in the urinary secretion, in the pancreatic\r\n    juice, in human bile, and in serous transudations, &c. Potassium, in\r\n    combination, is especially found in the red blood-corpuscles, in the\r\n    muscles, in the nervous tissues, and in milk. Ammonia, in\r\n    combination with acids, is naturally found in the stomach, in the\r\n    contents of the intestine; it is also a natural constituent of the\r\n    blood in small traces, and in a corpse is copiously evolved from\r\n    putrefactive changes.\r\n\r\n    It hence follows, that mere qualitative tests for these elements in\r\n    the tissues or fluids of the body are of not the slightest use, for\r\n    they are always present during the life of the healthiest\r\n    individual, and can be found after death in persons dying from any\r\n    malady whatever. To establish the fact of a person having taken an\r\n    unusual dose of any of the alkali salts, by simply chemical\r\n    evidence, it must be proved that the alkalies are present in unusual\r\n    quantities or in an abnormal state of combination.\r\n\r\n    In cases of rapid death, caused by sodic or potassic salts, they\r\n    will be found in such quantity in the contents of the stomach, or in\r\n    matters vomited, that there will probably be no difficulty in coming\r\n    to a direct conclusion; but if some time has elapsed, the analyst\r\n    may not find a sufficient ground for giving a decided judgment, the\r\n    excretion of the alkali salts being very rapid.\r\n\r\n    In most cases, it will be well to proceed as follows:--The contents\r\n    of the stomach are, if necessary, diluted with distilled water, and\r\n    divided into three parts, one of which is submitted to dialysis, and\r\n    then the dialysed liquid evaporated to a small bulk and examined\r\n    qualitatively, in order to ascertain whether a large amount of the\r\n    alkaline salts is present, and in what form. In this way, the\r\n    presence or absence of nitrate of potassium or sodium may be proved,\r\n    or the iodide, bromide, sulphate, and chlorate detected.\r\n\r\n    To find, in this way, nitrate of potassium, a coarse test is\r\n    preferable to the finer tests dependent upon conversion of the\r\n    nitrate into nitrites or into ammonia, for these tests are so\r\n    delicate, that nitrates may be detected in traces; whereas, in this\r\n    examination, to find traces is of no value. Hence, the old-fashioned\r\n    test of treating the concentrated liquid in a test-tube with copper\r\n    filings and then with sulphuric acid, and looking for the red fumes,\r\n    is best, and will act very well, even should, as is commonly the\r\n    case, some organic matters have passed through the dialyser.\r\n\r\n    Chlorates are indicated if the liquid is divided into two parts and\r\n    tested in the manner recommended at p. 127. If present in any\r\n    quantity, chlorates or nitrates may be indicated by the brilliant\r\n    combustion of the organic matter when heated to redness, as also by\r\n    the action of strong sulphuric acid on the solid substances--in the\r\n    one case, yellow vapours of peroxide of chlorine being evolved--in\r\n    the other, the red fumes already mentioned of nitric peroxide.\r\n\r\n    With regard to a substance such as the hydro-potassic tartrate, its\r\n    insolubility in water renders it not easy of detection by dialysis;\r\n    but its very insolubility will aid the analyst, for the contents of\r\n    the stomach may be treated with water, and thus all soluble salts of\r\n    the alkalies extracted. On now microscopically examining the\r\n    insoluble residue, crystals of bitartrate, if present, will be\r\n    readily seen. They may be picked up on a clean platinum wire and\r\n    heated to redness in a Bunsen flame, and spectroscopically examined.\r\n    After heating, the melted mass will have an alkaline reaction, and\r\n    give a precipitate with platinic chloride. All other organic salts\r\n    of potassium are soluble, and a white crystal giving such reaction\r\n    must be hydro-potassic tartrate.\r\n\r\n    =Ammonium Salts.=--If the body is fresh, and yet the salts of\r\n    ammonium present in large amount, it is safe to conclude that they\r\n    have an external origin; but there might be some considerable\r\n    difficulty in criminal poisoning by a neutral salt of ammonium, and\r\n    search for it in a highly putrid corpse. Probably, in such an\r\n    exceptional case, there would be other evidence. With regard to the\r\n    quantitative separation and estimation of the fixed alkalies in the\r\n    ash of organic substances, the reader is referred to the processes\r\n    given in “Foods,” p. 99, _et seq._, and in the present work, p. 121.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART V.--MORE OR LESS VOLATILE POISONOUS SUBSTANCES CAPABLE OF BEING\r\nSEPARATED BY DISTILLATION FROM NEUTRAL OR ACID LIQUIDS.\r\n\r\n    HYDROCARBONS--CAMPHOR--ALCOHOL--AMYL NITRITE--ETHER--CHLOROFORM AND\r\n    OTHER ANÆSTHETICS--CHLORAL--CARBON DISULPHIDE--CARBOLIC\r\n    ACID--NITRO-BENZENE--PRUSSIC ACID--PHOSPHORUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--Hydrocarbons.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. PETROLEUM.\r\n\r\n    § 137. Petroleum is a general term for a mixture of hydrocarbons of\r\n    the paraffin series, which are found naturally in certain parts of\r\n    the world, and are in commerce under liquid and solid forms of\r\n    various density. Crude petroleum is not imported into England, the\r\n    original substance having previously undergone more or less\r\n    rectification. The lighter and more volatile portions are known\r\n    under the name of cymogene, rhigolene, gasolene, and naphtha.\r\n\r\n    § 138. =Cymogene= has a specific gravity of ·590, and boils at 0°.\r\n    It has been employed in refrigerating machines. It appears to\r\n    consist chiefly of butane (C₄H₁₀).\r\n\r\n    § 139. =Rhigolene= is now used in medicine in the form of spray to\r\n    produce local anæsthesia. It boils at 18°, and has a density of\r\n    ·650.\r\n\r\n    § 140. =Gasolene= has a density of ·680-·688; it has received\r\n    technical applications in the “naphthalising” of air and gas.\r\n\r\n    § 141. =Benzoline= (=mineral naphtha=, =petroleum naphtha=,\r\n    =petroleum spirit=, =petroleum ether=) is a mixture of the lighter\r\n    series of hydro-carbons; the greater part consists of heptane, and\r\n    there is also a considerable quantity of pentane (C₇H₁₆) present.\r\n    The specific gravity varies from ·69 to ·74. It is very inflammable,\r\n    and is used in sponge lamps, and also as a solvent for gutta-percha,\r\n    naphthalene, paraffin, wax, and many other bodies. By the practical\r\n    chemist it is much employed.\r\n\r\n    The similarity of the terms _benzoline_ and _benzene_ has caused\r\n    benzoline to be often confused with _benzol_ or _benzene_, the\r\n    leading constituent of coal-tar naphtha (C₆H₆). Mr Allen[132] gives\r\n    in the following table a summary of the chief points of distinction,\r\n    both between petroleum naphtha, shale naphtha, and coal-tar naphtha.\r\n    The table is founded upon the examination of particular samples, and\r\n    commercial samples may present a few minor deviations.\r\n\r\n[132] _Commercial Organic Analysis_, vol. ii. p. 31.\r\n\r\nTABLE OF THE VARIETIES OF NAPHTHA.\r\n\r\n  +---------------------+----------------------+----------------------+\r\n  | Petroleum Naphtha.  |   Shale Naphtha.     |  Coal-tar Naphtha.   |\r\n  +---------------------+----------------------+----------------------+\r\n  |Contains at least 75 |Contains at least 60  |Consists almost wholly|\r\n  |per cent. of heptane,|to 70 per cent. of    |of benzene, C₆H₆, and  |\r\n  |C₇H₁₆, and other      |heptylene, C₇H₁₄, and  |other homologous     |\r\n  |hydrocarbons of the  |other hydrocarbons of |hydrocarbons, with a  |\r\n  |marsh gas or paraffin|the olefin series; the|small percentage of   |\r\n  |series; the remainder|remainder paraffins.  |light hydrocarbons in |\r\n  |apparently olefins,  |No trace of benzene or|some samples.         |\r\n  |C_{n}H_{2n}, with    |its homologues.       |                      |\r\n  |distinct traces of   |                      |                      |\r\n  |benzene and its      |                      |                      |\r\n  |homologues.          |                      |                      |\r\n  |                     |                      |                      |\r\n  |Specific gravity at  |Specific gravity at   |Specific gravity ·876.|\r\n  |15°, ·600.           |15°, ·718.            |                      |\r\n  |                     |                      |                      |\r\n  |Distils between 65°  |Distils between 65°   |Distils between 80°   |\r\n  |and 100°.            |and 100°.             |and 120°.             |\r\n  |                     |                      |                      |\r\n  |Dissolves coal-tar   |Behaves similarly to  |Readily dissolves     |\r\n  |pitch, but slightly; |petroleum naphtha with|pitch, forming a deep |\r\n  |liquid, but little   |regard to the solution|brown solution.       |\r\n  |coloured even after  |of pitch.             |                      |\r\n  |prolonged contact.   |                      |                      |\r\n  |                     |                      |                      |\r\n  |On shaking three     |When treated with     |The liquids form a    |\r\n  |measures of the      |fused carbolic acid   |homogeneous mixture   |\r\n  |sample with one      |crystals, the liquids |when treated with     |\r\n  |measure of fused     |mix perfectly.        |fused carbolic acid   |\r\n  |crystals of absolute |                      |crystals.             |\r\n  |carbolic acid, no    |                      |                      |\r\n  |solution.

It should be free from the\r\n    more volatile constituents, and hence should not take fire when a\r\n    flame is applied near the surface of the cold liquid.\r\n\r\n    § 143. =Effects of Petroleum.=--Since we have here to deal with a\r\n    commercial substance of such different degrees of purity, and\r\n    various samples of which are composed of such various proportions of\r\n    different hydrocarbons, its action can only be stated in very\r\n    general terms. Eulenberg[133] has experimented with the lighter\r\n    products obtained from the distillation of Canadian petroleum. This\r\n    contained sulphur products, and was extremely poisonous, the vapour\r\n    killing a rabbit in a short time, with previous insensibility and\r\n    convulsions. The autopsy showed a thin extravasation of blood on the\r\n    surface of each of the bulbi, much coagulated blood in the heart,\r\n    congested lungs, and a bloody mucus covering the tracheal mucous\r\n    membrane. An experiment made on a cat with the lighter petroleum\r\n    (which had no excess of sulphur) in the state of vapour, showed that\r\n    it was an anæsthetic, the anæsthesia being accompanied by\r\n    convulsions, which towards the end were tetanic and violent. The\r\n    evaporation of 1·5 grm. in a close chamber killed the animal in\r\n    three hours. The lungs were found congested, but little else was\r\n    remarkable. Much petroleum vapour is breathed in certain factories,\r\n    especially those in which petroleum is refined.[134] From this cause\r\n    there have been rather frequent toxic symptoms among the workmen.\r\n    Eulenberg[135] describes the symptoms as follows:--A person, after\r\n    breathing an overdose of the vapour, becomes very pale, the lips are\r\n    livid, the respiration slow, the heart’s action weak and scarcely to\r\n    be felt. If he does not immediately go into the open air away from\r\n    the poisonous vapour, these symptoms may pass on to insensibility,\r\n    convulsions, and death. It often occasions a condition of the\r\n    voluntary muscles similar to that induced by drunkenness, and on\r\n    recovery the patient is troubled by singing in the ears and noises\r\n    in the head. The smell and taste of the poison may remain for a long\r\n    time.\r\n\r\n[133] _Gewerbe-Hygiene._\r\n\r\n[134] The vapour most likely to rise at the ordinary temperature, and\r\nmix with the atmosphere, is that of the lighter series, from cymogene to\r\nbenzoline.\r\n\r\n[135] _Op. cit._\r\n\r\n    § 144. Poisoning by taking light petroleum into the stomach is not\r\n    common. In a case recorded by Taylor,[136] a woman, for the purpose\r\n    of suicide, swallowed a pint of petroleum, There followed a slight\r\n    pain in the stomach, and a little febrile disturbance, and a\r\n    powerful smell of petroleum remained about the body for six days;\r\n    but she completely recovered. In August 1870 a sea-captain drank a\r\n    quantity of paraffin, that is, lighting petroleum, and died in a few\r\n    hours in an unconscious state. A child, 2 years old, was brought to\r\n    King’s College Hospital within ten minutes after taking a\r\n    teaspoonful of paraffin. It was semi-comatose and pale, with\r\n    contracted pupils; there was no vomiting or purging. Emetics of\r\n    sulphate of zinc were administered, and the child recovered in\r\n    twenty-four hours. In another case treated at the same hospital, a\r\n    child had swallowed an unknown quantity of paraffin. It fell into a\r\n    comatose state, which simulated tubercular meningitis, and lasted\r\n    for nearly three weeks.[137] In a case recorded by Mr Robert\r\n    Smith,[138] a child, 4 years of age, had swallowed an unknown\r\n    quantity of paraffin. A few minutes afterwards, the symptoms\r\n    commenced; they were those of suffocation, with a constant cough;\r\n    there was no expectoration; the tongue, gums, and cheeks were\r\n    blanched and swollen where the fluid touched them; recovery\r\n    followed. A woman, aged 32, who had taken a quarter of a pint of\r\n    paraffin, was found unconscious and very cold; the stomach-pump was\r\n    used, and she recovered.[139] Hence it is tolerably certain, from\r\n    the above instances, that should a case of petroleum poisoning\r\n    occur, the expert will not have to deal with infinitesimal\r\n    quantities; but while the odour of the oil will probably be\r\n    distinctly perceptible, there will be also a sufficient amount\r\n    obtained either from matters vomited, or the contents of the\r\n    stomach, &c., so that no difficulty will be experienced in\r\n    identifying it.\r\n\r\n[136] _Poisons_, p. 656\r\n\r\n[137] _Brit. Med. Journ._, Sept. 16, 1876, p. 365.\r\n\r\n[138] _Brit. Med. Journ._, Oct. 14, 1876.\r\n\r\n[139] _Pharm. Journ._, Feb. 12, 1875; also for other cases see _Brit.\r\nMed. Journ._, Nov. 4, 1876; and Köhler’s _Physiol. Therap._, p. 437.\r\n\r\n    § 145. In order to separate petroleum from any liquid, the\r\n    substances under examination must be carefully distilled in the\r\n    manner recommended under “_Ether_.” The lighter petroleums will\r\n    distil by the aid of a water-bath; but the heavier require a\r\n    stronger heat; redistillation of the distillate may be necessary.\r\n    The odour of the liquid, its inflammable character, and its other\r\n    properties, will be sufficient for identification.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. COAL-TAR-NAPHTHA--BENZENE.\r\n\r\n    § 146. Coal-tar-naphtha in its crude state, is an extremely complex\r\n    liquid, of a most disagreeable smell. Much benzene (C₆H₆) is present\r\n    with higher homologues of the benzene series. Toluene (C₇H₈),\r\n    naphthalene (C₁₀H₈), hydrocarbons of the paraffin series,\r\n    especially hexane (C₆H₁₄), and hydrocarbons of the olefin series,\r\n    especially pentylene, hexylene, and heptylene (C₅H₁₀, C₆H₁₂ and\r\n    C₇H₁₄). Besides these, there are nitrogenised bases, such as\r\n    aniline, picoline, and pyridine; phenols, especially carbolic acid;\r\n    ammonia, ammonium sulphide, carbon disulphide, and probably other\r\n    sulphur compounds; acetylene and aceto-nitrile. By distillation and\r\n    fractional distillation are produced what are technically known\r\n    ”_once run_” _naphtha_, _90 per cent. benzol_, _50 and 90 per cent.\r\n    benzol_,[140] _30 per cent. benzol_, _solvent naphtha_, and residue\r\n    known as “_last runnings_.”\r\n\r\n[140] Or 50/90 benzol, this indicates that 50 per cent. distils over\r\nbelow 100°; and 40, making in all 90, below 120°.\r\n\r\n    § 147. Taylor[141] records a case in which a boy, aged 12, swallowed\r\n    about 3 ozs. of naphtha, the kind usually sold for burning in lamps,\r\n    and died with symptoms of narcotic poisoning. The child, after\r\n    taking it, ran about in wild delirium, he then sank into a state of\r\n    collapse, breathing stertorously, and the skin became cold and\r\n    clammy. On vomiting being excited, he rejected about two\r\n    tablespoonfuls of the naphtha, and recovered somewhat, but again\r\n    fell into collapse with great muscular relaxation. The breathing was\r\n    difficult; there were no convulsions; the eyes were fixed and\r\n    glassy, the pupils contracted; there was frothing at the mouth. In\r\n    spite of every effort to save him, he died in less than three hours\r\n    after taking the poison. The body, examined three days after death,\r\n    smelt strongly of naphtha, but the _post-mortem_ appearances were in\r\n    no way peculiar, save that the stomach contained a pint of\r\n    semi-fluid matter, from which a fluid, having the characteristics of\r\n    impure benzene, was separated.\r\n\r\n[141] _Op. cit._, p. 657.\r\n\r\n    § 148. The effects of the vapour of benzene have been studied by\r\n    Eulenberg in experiments on cats and rabbits, and there are also\r\n    available observations on men[142] who have been accidentally\r\n    exposed to its influence. From these sources of information, it is\r\n    evident that the vapour of benzene has a distinctly narcotic effect,\r\n    while influencing also in a marked degree the spinal cord. There\r\n    are, as symptoms, noises in the head, convulsive trembling and\r\n    twitchings of the muscles, with difficulty of breathing.\r\n\r\n[142] Dr. Stone, _Med. Gaz._, 1848, vol. xii. p. 1077.\r\n\r\n\r\nDETECTION AND SEPARATION OF BENZENE.\r\n\r\n    § 149. Benzene is separated from liquids by distillation, and may be\r\n    recognised by its odour, and by the properties described at p. 130.\r\n    The best process of identification, perhaps, is to purify and\r\n    convert it into nitro-benzene, and then into aniline, in the\r\n    following manner:--\r\n\r\n    1. =Purification.=--The liquid is agitated with a solution of\r\n    caustic soda; this dissolves out of the benzene any bodies of an\r\n    acid character, such as phenol, &c. The purified liquid should again\r\n    be distilled, collecting that portion of the distillate which passes\r\n    over between 65° and 100°; directly the thermometer attains nearly\r\n    the 100°, the distillation should be stopped. The distillate, which\r\n    contains all the benzene present, is next shaken with concentrated\r\n    sulphuric acid in the cold; this will dissolve out all the\r\n    hydrocarbons of the ethylene and acetylene series. On removing the\r\n    layer of benzene from the acid, it must be again shaken up with\r\n    dilute soda, so as to remove any trace of acid. The benzene is, by\r\n    this rather complicated series of operations, obtained in a very\r\n    fair state of purity, and may be converted into nitro-benzene, as\r\n    follows:--\r\n\r\n    2. =Conversion into Nitro-Benzene.=--The oily liquid is placed in a\r\n    flask, and treated with four times its volume of fuming nitric acid.\r\n    The flask must be furnished with an upright condenser; a vigorous\r\n    action mostly takes place without the application of heat, but if\r\n    this does not occur, the flask may be warmed for a few minutes.\r\n\r\n    After the conversion is over, the liquid, while still warm, must be\r\n    transferred into a burette furnished with a glass tap, or to a\r\n    separating funnel, and all, except the top layer, run into cold\r\n    water; if benzene was originally present, either oily drops of\r\n    nitro-benzene will fall, or if the benzene was only in small\r\n    quantity, a fine precipitate will gradually settle down to the\r\n    bottom of the vessel, and a distinct bitter-almond smell be\r\n    observed; but, if there be no benzene in the original liquid, and,\r\n    consequently, no nitro-benzene formed, no such appearance will be\r\n    observed.\r\n\r\n    3. =Conversion into Aniline.=--The nitro-benzene may itself be\r\n    identified by collecting it on a wet filter, dissolving it off the\r\n    filter by alcohol, acidifying the alcoholic solution by hydrochloric\r\n    acid, and then boiling it for some time with metallic zinc. In this\r\n    way aniline is formed by reduction. On neutralising and diluting the\r\n    liquid, and cautiously adding a little clear solution of\r\n    bleaching-powder, a blue or purple colour passing to brown is in a\r\n    little time produced.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. TERPENES--ESSENTIAL OILS--OIL OF TURPENTINE.\r\n\r\n    § 150. The terpenes are hydrocarbons of the general formula\r\n    C_{n}H_{2n-4}. The natural terpenes are divided into three\r\n    classes:--\r\n\r\n    1. =The true terpenes=, _formula_ (C₁₀H₁₆)--a large number of\r\n    essential oils, such as those of turpentine, orange peel, nutmeg,\r\n    caraway, anise, thyme, &c., are mainly composed of terpenes.\r\n\r\n    2. =The cedrenes=, _formula_ (C₁₅H₂₄)--the essential oil of cloves,\r\n    rosewood, cubebs, calamus, cascarilla, and patchouli belong to this\r\n    class.\r\n\r\n    3. =The colophene hydrocarbons=, _formula_ (C₂₀H₃₂), represented by\r\n    colophony.\r\n\r\n    Of all these, oil of turpentine alone has any toxicological\r\n    significance; it is, however, true that all the essential oils, if\r\n    taken in considerable doses, are poisonous, and cause, for the most\r\n    part, vascular excitement and complex nervous phenomena, but their\r\n    action has not been very completely studied. They may all be\r\n    separated by distillation, but a more convenient process for\r\n    recovering an essential oil from a liquid is to shake it up with\r\n    petroleum ether, separating the petroleum and evaporating\r\n    spontaneously; by this means the oil is left in a fair state of\r\n    purity.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. OIL OF TURPENTINE--SPIRIT OF TURPENTINE--“TURPS.”\r\n\r\n    § 151. Various species of pine yield a crude turpentine, holding in\r\n    solution more or less resin. The turpentine may be obtained from\r\n    this exudation by distillation, and when the first portion of the\r\n    distillate is treated with alkali, and then redistilled, the final\r\n    product is known under the name of “rectified oil of turpentine,”\r\n    and is sometimes called “camphene.” It mainly consists of\r\n    terebenthene. Terebenthene obtained from French turpentine differs\r\n    in some respects from that obtained from English or American\r\n    turpentine. They are both mobile, colourless liquids, having the\r\n    well-known odour of turpentine and highly refractive; but the French\r\n    terebenthene turns a ray of polarised light to the left -40·3° for\r\n    the sodium ray, and the English to the right +21·5°; the latter\r\n    terebenthene is known scientifically as austra-terebenthene. This\r\n    action on polarised light is retained in the various compounds and\r\n    polymers of the two turpentine oils.\r\n\r\n    The specific gravity of turpentine oil is ·864; its boiling point,\r\n    when consisting of pure terebenthene, 156°, but impurities may raise\r\n    it up to 160°; it is combustible and burns with a smoky flame. Oil\r\n    of turpentine is very soluble in ether, petroleum ether, carbon\r\n    disulphide, chloroform, benzene, fixed and essential oils, and by\r\n    the use of these solvents it is conveniently separated from the\r\n    contents of the stomach. It is insoluble in water, glycerin, and\r\n    dilute alkaline and acid solutions; and very soluble in absolute\r\n    alcohol, from which it may be precipitated by the addition of water.\r\n\r\n    It is polymerised by the action of strong sulphuric acid, the\r\n    polymer, of course, boiling at a higher temperature than the\r\n    original oil. With water it forms a crystalline hydrate\r\n    (C₁₀H₂₀O₂,H₂O). On passing nitrosyl chloride gas into the oil,\r\n    either pure or diluted with chloroform or alcohol, the mixture being\r\n    cooled by ice, a white crystalline body is deposited, of the formula\r\n    C₁₀H₁₆(NOCl). By treating this compound with alcoholic potash, the\r\n    substitution product (C₁₀H₁₆NO) is obtained. By treating turpentine\r\n    with an equal bulk of warm water, and shaking it in a large bottle\r\n    with air, camphoric acid and peroxide of hydrogen are formed. When\r\n    turpentine oil is left in contact with concentrated hydrochloric\r\n    acid, there is formed terebenthene dihydrochloride (C₁₀H₁₆2HCl),\r\n    which forms rhombic plates, insoluble in water, and decomposable by\r\n    boiling alcoholic potash, with formation of terpinol, (C₁₀H₁₇)₂O.\r\n    The dihydrochloride gives a colour-reaction with ferric chloride.\r\n    This is an excellent test--not, it is true, confined to oil of\r\n    turpentine--but common to the dihydrochlorides of all the terpenes.\r\n    A few drops of the oil are stirred in a porcelain capsule with a\r\n    drop of hydrochloric acid, and one of ferric chloride solution; on\r\n    gently heating, there is produced first a rose colour, then a\r\n    violet-red, and lastly a blue.\r\n\r\n    § 152. =Effects of the Administration of Turpentine.=--L. W.\r\n    Liersch[143] exposed animals to the vapour of turpentine, and found\r\n    that a cat and a rabbit died within half an hour. There was observed\r\n    uneasiness, reeling, want of power in the limbs (more especially in\r\n    the hinder extremities), convulsions partial, or general, difficulty\r\n    of respiration; and the heart’s action was quickened. Death took\r\n    place, in part, from asphyxia, and in part was attributable to a\r\n    direct action on the nervous centres. The autopsy showed congestion\r\n    of the lungs, ecchymoses of the kidney, and much blood in the liver\r\n    and spleen. Small doses of turpentine-vapour cause (according to Sir\r\n    B. W. Richardson)[144] giddiness, deficient appetite, and anæmia.\r\n    From half an ounce to an ounce is frequently prescribed in the\r\n    country as a remedy for tape-worm; in smaller quantities it is found\r\n    to be a useful medicine in a great variety of ailments. The larger\r\n    doses produce a kind of intoxication with giddiness, followed often\r\n    by purging and strangury, not unfrequently blood and albumen (or\r\n    both) is found in the urine. When in medical practice I have given\r\n    the oil, and seen it given by others, in large doses for tape-worm\r\n    to adults, in perhaps 40 cases, but in no one instance were the\r\n    symptoms severe; the slight intoxication subsided quickly, and in a\r\n    few hours the patients recovered completely. Nevertheless it has\r\n    been known to destroy the lives of children, and cause most serious\r\n    symptoms in adults. Two fatal cases are mentioned by Taylor; one was\r\n    that of a child who died fifteen hours after taking half an ounce of\r\n    the oil; in another an infant, five months old, died rapidly from a\r\n    teaspoonful. The symptoms in these fatal cases were profound coma\r\n    and slight convulsions; the pupils were contracted, and there was\r\n    slow and irregular breathing. Turpentine is eliminated in a changed\r\n    form by the kidneys, and imparts an odour of violet to the urine;\r\n    but the nature of the odoriferous principle has not yet been\r\n    investigated.\r\n\r\n[143] Clarus in Schmidt’s _Jahrbücher_, Bd. cxvii., i. 1863; and\r\n_Vierteljahrsschr. für ger.

A great many essential oils deposit, after exposure to air,\r\n    camphors produced by oxidation of their terpenes. Ordinary camphor\r\n    is imported in the rough state from China and Japan, and is prepared\r\n    by distilling with water the wood of _Camphora officinarum_; it is\r\n    resublimed in England. The formula of camphor is C₁₀H₁₆O; it has a\r\n    density of ·986 to ·996; melts at 175°, and boils at 205°. It is\r\n    readily sublimed, especially in a vacuum, and is indeed so volatile\r\n    at all temperatures, that a lump of camphor exposed to the air\r\n    wastes away. It is somewhat insoluble in water (about 1 part in\r\n    1000), but this is enough to impart a distinct taste to the water;\r\n    it is insoluble in chloroform, ether, acetone, acetic acid, carbon\r\n    disulphide, and oils. It has a fragrant odour and a burning taste. A\r\n    10 per cent. solution in alcohol turns a ray of polarised light to\r\n    the right +42·8°. By distillation with zinc chloride, cymene and\r\n    other products are produced. By prolonged treatment with nitric\r\n    acid, camphor is oxidised to camphoric acid (C₁₀H₁₆O₄). Camphor\r\n    unites with bromine to form a crystalline, unstable dibromide, which\r\n    splits up on distillation into hydrobromic acid and monobrom-camphor\r\n    (C₁₀H₁₅BrO). The latter is used in medicine; it crystallises in\r\n    prisms fusible at 76°, and is readily soluble in alcohol.\r\n\r\n    § 154. =Pharmaceutical Preparations.=--The preparations officinal in\r\n    the British Pharmacopœia are _camphor water_--water saturated with\r\n    camphor, containing about one part per thousand.\r\n\r\n    =Camphor Liniment.=--A solution of camphor in olive oil, strength 25\r\n    per cent.\r\n\r\n    =Compound Camphor Liniment.=--Composed of camphor, oil of lavender,\r\n    strong solution of ammonia and alcohol; strength in camphor about 11\r\n    per cent.\r\n\r\n    =Spirit of Camphor.=--A solution of camphor in spirit; strength, 10\r\n    per cent.\r\n\r\n    Camphor is also a constituent of the _compound tincture of camphor_;\r\n    but in this case it may be considered only a flavouring agent. There\r\n    is a homœopathic solution of camphor in spirit (Rubini’s Essence of\r\n    Camphor). The solution is made by saturating alcohol with camphor;\r\n    it is, therefore, very strong--about half the bulk consisting of\r\n    camphor. Camphor is used in veterinary medicine, both externally and\r\n    internally.\r\n\r\n    § 155. =Symptoms.=--Camphor acts energetically on the brain and\r\n    nervous system, especially if it is given in strong alcoholic\r\n    solution, and thus placed under conditions favouring absorption.\r\n    Some years ago, Dr. G. Johnson[145] published a series of cases\r\n    arising from the injudicious use of “homœopathic solution of\r\n    camphor,” from 7 to 40 drops of Rubini’s homœopathic camphor taken\r\n    for colds, sore throat, &c., having produced coma, foaming at the\r\n    mouth, convulsions, and partial paralysis. All the patients\r\n    recovered, but their condition was for a little time alarming.\r\n\r\n[145] _Brit. Med. Journ._, Feb. 27, 1878, p. 272; see also _ibid._, Feb.\r\n1875.\r\n\r\n    The cases of fatal poisoning by camphor are very rare. A woman, aged\r\n    46, pregnant four months, took 12 grms. (about 184 grains) in a\r\n    glass of brandy for the purpose of procuring abortion. In a very\r\n    short time the symptoms commenced; she had intolerable headache, the\r\n    face was flushed, and there was a sensation of burning in the\r\n    stomach. In eight hours after taking the dose, she had strangury and\r\n    vomiting, and the pain in the epigastrium was intense. These\r\n    symptoms continued with more or less severity until the third day,\r\n    when she became much worse. Her face was pale and livid, the eyes\r\n    hollow, the skin cold and insensible, pulse weak and thready,\r\n    breathing laboured. There were violent cramps in the stomach and\r\n    retention of urine for twenty-four hours, and then coma. The patient\r\n    lingered on yet another three days, aborted, and died.[146]\r\n\r\n[146] _Journ. de Chim. Méd._, May 1860.\r\n\r\n    Dr. Schaaf[147] has recorded three cases of poisoning--one of which\r\n    was fatal. A woman gave about half a teaspoonful of a camphor\r\n    solution to each of her three children, the ages being respectively\r\n    five and three years and fifteen months. The symptoms noted were\r\n    pallor of the face, a burning pain in the throat, thirst, vomiting,\r\n    purging, convulsions, and afterwards coma. The youngest child died\r\n    in seven hours; the others recovered. The smallest dose known to\r\n    have produced violent symptoms in an adult is 1·3 grm. (20 grains);\r\n    the largest dose known to have been recovered from is 10·4 grms.\r\n    (160 grains).[148]\r\n\r\n[147] _Journ. de Chim. Méd._, 1850, p. 507.\r\n\r\n[148] Taylor on _Poisons_, 3rd ed., 661.\r\n\r\n    § 156. =Post-mortem Appearances.=--The bodies of animals or persons\r\n    dying from poisoning by camphor, smell strongly of the substance.\r\n    The mucous membrane of the stomach has been found inflamed, but\r\n    there seem to be no characteristic lesions.\r\n\r\n    § 157. =Separation of Camphor from the Contents of the\r\n    Stomach.=--The identification of camphor would probably in no case\r\n    present any difficulty. It may be readily dissolved out from organic\r\n    fluids by chloroform. If dissolved in fixed oils, enough for the\r\n    purposes of identification may be obtained by simple distillation.\r\n    It is precipitated from its alcoholic solution by the addition of\r\n    water.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--Alcohols.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. ETHYLIC ALCOHOL.\r\n\r\n§ 158. The chemical properties of ordinary alcohol are fully described,\r\nwith the appropriate tests, in “Foods,” pp. 369-384, and the reader is\r\nalso referred to the same volume for the composition and strength of the\r\nvarious alcoholic drinks.\r\n\r\n=Statistics.=--If we were to include in one list the deaths indirectly\r\ndue to chronic, as well as acute poisoning by alcohol, it would stand\r\nfirst of all poisons in order of frequency, but the taking of doses so\r\nlarge as to cause death in a few hours is rare. The deaths from alcohol\r\nare included by the English registrar-general under two heads, viz.,\r\nthose returned as dying from _delirium tremens_, and those certified as\r\ndue directly to intemperance.\r\n\r\nDuring the twenty-five years, from 1868 to 1892, 30,219 deaths have been\r\nregistered as due to intemperance, which gives an average of 1209 per\r\nyear. The rate per million has varied during the period from 29 to 71;\r\nand the figures taken as a whole show that deaths from intemperance\r\nappear to be increasing; the increase may be only apparent, not real,\r\nfor it is a significant circumstance that deaths registered under liver\r\ndiseases show a corresponding decrease; it is, therefore, not unlikely\r\nthat deaths which formerly would be ascribed to liver disease, are more\r\noften now stated to be the effects of intemperance.\r\n\r\nDeaths directly due to large doses of alcohol are not uncommon; during\r\nthe ten years ending 1892, 105 deaths (81 males and 24 females) were\r\nascribed under the head of “accident or negligence” directly to alcohol.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHART SHEWING DEATHS PER MILLION PERSONS LIVING, FROM\r\nINTEMPERANCE & FROM LIVER DISEASES.\r\n\r\n  THE MEDICAL “OFFICERS OF HEALTH” CHART.\r\n\r\n  ENT. AT STA. HALL.\r\n\r\n                        Notes.\r\n                _Intemperance_  --------------\r\n                _Liver disease_ ..............\r\n  _The Scale for Intemperance is as printed._\r\n  _That for Liver diseases is 10 times larger._]\r\n\r\n§ 159. =Criminal or Accidental Alcoholic Poisoning.=--Suicide by\r\nalcohol, in the common acceptation of the term, is rare, and murder\r\nstill rarer, though not unknown. In the ten years ending 1892, only\r\nthree deaths from alcohol (1 male and 2 females) are recorded as\r\nsuicidal. Perhaps the most common cause of fatal acute poisoning by\r\nalcohol is either a foolish wager, by which a man bets that he can drink\r\nso many glasses of spirits without bad effect; or else the drugging of a\r\nperson already drunk by his companions in a sportive spirit.\r\n\r\n§ 160. =Fatal Dose.=--It is difficult to say what would be likely to\r\nprove a lethal dose of alcohol, for a great deal depends, without doubt,\r\non the dilution of the spirit, since the mere local action of strong\r\nalcohol on the mucous membranes of the stomach, &c., is severe (one may\r\nalmost say corrosive), and would aid the more remote effects. In\r\nMaschka’s case,[149] a boy of nine years and a girl of five, died from\r\nabout two and a half ounces of spirit of 67 per cent. strength, or 48·2\r\nc.c. (1·7 oz.) of absolute alcohol.\r\n\r\n[149] Recorded by Maschka (_Gutachten der Prager Facultät_, iv. 239; see\r\nalso Maschka’s _Handbuch der gericht. Medicin_, Band. ii. p. 384). The\r\nfollowing is a brief summary:--Franz. Z., nine years old, and Caroline\r\nZ., eight years old, were poisoned by their stepfather with spirit of 67\r\nper cent. strength taken in small quantities by each--at first by\r\npersuasion, and the remainder administered by force. About one-eighth of\r\na pint is said to have been given to each child. Both vomited somewhat,\r\nthen lying down, stertorous breathing at once came on, and they quickly\r\ndied. The autopsy, three days after death, showed dilatation of the\r\npupils; _rigor mortis_ present in the boy, not in the girl; and the\r\nmembranes of the brain filled with dark fluid blood. The smell of\r\nalcohol was perceptible on opening the chest; the mucous membrane of the\r\nbronchial tubes and gullet was normal, both lungs œdematous, the fine\r\ntubes gorged with a bloody frothy fluid, and the mucous membrane of the\r\nwhole intestinal canal was reddened. The stomach was not, unfortunately,\r\nexamined, being reserved for chemical analysis. The heart was healthy;\r\nthe pericardium contained some straw-coloured fluid. Chemical analysis\r\ngave an entirely negative result, which must have been from insufficient\r\nmaterial having been submitted to the analyst, for I cannot see how the\r\nvapours of alcohol could have been detected by the smell, and yet have\r\nevaded chemical processes.\r\n\r\nIn a case related by Taylor, a child, seven years old, died from some\r\nquantity of brandy, probably about 113·4 c.c. (4 ozs.), which would be\r\nequal to at least 56·7 c.c. (2 ozs.) of absolute alcohol. From other\r\ncases in which the quantity of absolute alcohol can be, with some\r\napproximation to the truth, valued, it is evident that, for any child\r\nbelow ten or twelve, quantities of from 28·3 to 56·6 c.c. (1-2 ozs.) of\r\nabsolute alcohol contained in brandy, gin, &c., would be a highly\r\ndangerous and probably fatal dose; while the toxic dose for adults is\r\nsomewhere between 71·8-141·7 c.c. (2·5-5 ozs.).\r\n\r\n§ 161. =Symptoms.=--In the cases of rapid poisoning by a large dose of\r\nalcohol, which alone concern us, the preliminary, and too familiar\r\nexcitement of the drunkard, may be hardly observable; but the second\r\nstage, that of depression, rapidly sets in; the unhappy victim sinks\r\ndown to the ground helpless, the face pale, the eyes injected and\r\nstaring, the pupils dilated, acting sluggishly to light, and the skin\r\nremarkably cold. Fräntzel[150] found, in a case in which the patient\r\nsurvived, a temperature of only 24·6° in the rectum, and in that of\r\nanother person who died, a temperature of 23·8°. The mucous membranes\r\nare of a peculiar dusky blue; the pulse, which at first is quick, soon\r\nbecomes slow and small; the respiration is also slowed, intermittent,\r\nand stertorous; there is complete loss of consciousness and motion; the\r\nbreath smells strongly of the alcoholic drink, and if the coma continues\r\nthere may be vomiting and involuntary passing of excreta. Death\r\nultimately occurs through paralysis of the respiratory centres.\r\nConvulsions in adults are rare, in children frequent. Death has more\r\nthan once been immediately caused, not by the poison, but by accidents\r\ndependent upon loss of consciousness. Thus food has been sucked into the\r\nair-tubes, or the person has fallen, so that the face was buried in\r\nwater, ordure, or mud; here suffocation has been induced by mechanical\r\ncauses.\r\n\r\n[150] _Temperaturerniedrigung durch Alcoholintoxication, Charité\r\nAnnalen_, i. 371.\r\n\r\nA remarkable course not known with any other narcotic is that in which\r\nthe symptoms remit, the person wakes up, as it were, moves about and\r\ndoes one or more rational acts, and then suddenly dies. In this case\r\nalso, the death is not directly due to alcohol, but indirectly--the\r\nalcohol having developed œdema, pneumonia, or other affection of the\r\nlungs, which causes the sudden termination when the first effect of the\r\npoison has gone off. The time that may elapse from the commencement of\r\ncoma till death varies from a few minutes to days; death has occurred\r\nafter a quarter of an hour, half an hour, and an hour. It has also been\r\nprolonged to three, four, and six days, during the whole of which the\r\ncoma has continued. The average period may, however, be put at from six\r\nto ten hours.\r\n\r\n§ 162. =Post-mortem Appearances.=--Cadaveric rigidity lasts tolerably\r\nlong. Casper has seen it still existing nine days after death, and\r\nSeidel[151] seven days (in February). Putrefaction is retarded in those\r\ncases in which a very large dose has been taken, but this is not a very\r\nnoticeable or constant characteristic. The pupils are mostly dilated.\r\nThe smell of alcohol should be watched for; sometimes it is only present\r\nin cases where but a short time has elapsed between the taking of the\r\npoison and death; putrefaction may also conceal it, but under favourable\r\ncircumstances, especially if the weather is cold, the alcoholic smell\r\nmay remain a long time. Alcohol may cause the most intense redness and\r\ncongestion of the stomach. The most inflamed stomach I ever saw, short\r\nof inflammation by the corrosive poisons, was that of a sailor, who died\r\nsuddenly after a twenty-four hours’ drinking bout: all the organs of the\r\nbody were fairly healthy, the man had suffered from no disease; analysis\r\ncould detect no poison but alcohol; and the history of the case,\r\nmoreover, proved clearly that it was a pure case of alcoholic poisoning.\r\n\r\n[151] Seidel, Maschka’s _Handbuch_, Bd. ii. p. 380.\r\n\r\nIn a case related by Taylor, in which a child drank 4 ozs. of brandy and\r\ndied, the mucous membrane of the stomach presented patches of intense\r\nredness, and in several places was thickened and softened, some portions\r\nbeing actually detached and hanging loose, and there were evident signs\r\nof extravasations of blood. The effect may not be confined to the\r\nstomach, but extend to the duodenum and even to the whole intestinal\r\ncanal. The blood is generally dark and fluid, and usually the contents\r\nof the skull are markedly hyperæmic, the pia very full of blood, the\r\nsinuses and plexus gorged; occasionally, the brain-substance shows signs\r\nof unusual congestion; serum is often found in the ventricles. The great\r\nveins of the neck, the lungs, and the right side of the heart, are very\r\noften found full of blood, and the left side empty. Œdema of the lungs\r\nalso occurs with tolerable frequency. The great veins of the abdomen are\r\nalso filled with blood, and if the coma has been prolonged, the bladder\r\nwill be distended with urine. A rare phenomenon has also been\r\nnoticed--namely, the occurrence of blebs on the extremities, &c., just\r\nas if the part affected had been burnt or scalded. Lastly, with the\r\nchanges directly due to the fatal dose may be included all those\r\ndegenerations met with in the chronic drinker, provided the case had a\r\nhistory of previous intemperance.\r\n\r\n§ 163. =Excretion of Alcohol.=--Alcohol, in the diluted form, is quickly\r\nabsorbed by the blood-vessels of the stomach, &c., and circulates in the\r\nblood; but what becomes of it afterwards is by no means settled. I think\r\nthere can be little doubt that the lungs are the main channels through\r\nwhich it is eliminated; with persons given up to habits of intemperance,\r\nthe breath has constantly a very peculiar ethereal odour, probably\r\ndependent upon some highly volatile oxidised product of alcohol.\r\n\r\nAlcohol is eliminated in small proportion only by the kidneys.\r\nThudichum, in an experiment[152] by which 4000 grms. of absolute alcohol\r\nwere consumed by thirty-three men, could only find in the collected\r\nurine 10 grms. of alcohol. The numerous experiments by Dupré also\r\nestablish the same truth, that but a fraction of the total alcohol\r\nabsorbed is excreted by the kidneys. According to Lallemand, Perrin, and\r\nDuroy the content of the brain in alcohol is more than that of the\r\nother organs. I have found also that the brain after death has a\r\nwonderful attraction for alcohol, and yields it up at a water-heat very\r\nslowly and with difficulty. In one experiment, in which a finely-divided\r\nportion of brain, which had been soaking in alcohol for many weeks, was\r\nsubmitted to a steam heat of 100°, twenty-four hours’ consecutive\r\nheating failed to expel every trace of spirit.\r\n\r\n[152] See Thudichum’s _Pathology of the Urine_, London, 1877, in which\r\nboth his own and Dr. Dupré’s experiments are summarised.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that true alcoholates of the chemical constituents of the\r\nbrain are formed. In the case of vegetable colloidal bodies, such, for\r\nexample, as the pulp of cherries, a similar attraction has been\r\nobserved, the fruit condensing, as it were, the alcohol in its own\r\ntissues, and the outer liquid being of less alcoholic strength than that\r\nwhich can be expressed from the steeped cherries. Alcohol is also\r\nexcreted by the sweat, and minute fractions have been found in the\r\nfæces.\r\n\r\n§ 164. =Toxicological Detection of Alcohol= (see “Foods,” pp.\r\n406-419).--The living cells of the body produce minute quantities of\r\nalcohol, as also some of the bacteria normally inhabiting the small\r\nintestine produce small quantities of alcohol, and it is often found in\r\ntraces in putrefying fluids. Hence, mere qualitative proofs of the\r\npresence of alcohol are insufficient on which to base an opinion as to\r\nwhether alcohol had been taken during life or not, and it will be\r\nnecessary to estimate the quantity accurately by some of the processes\r\ndetailed in “Foods,” p. 409, _et seq._ In those cases in which alcohol\r\nis found in quantity in the stomach, there can, of course, be no\r\ndifficulty; in others, the whole of the alcohol may have been absorbed,\r\nand chemical evidence, unless extremely definite, must be supplemented\r\nby other facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. AMYLIC ALCOHOL.\r\n\r\n    § 165. =Amylic Alcohol=--_Formula_, C₅H₁₁HO.--There is more than one\r\n    amylic alcohol according to theory; eight isomers are possible, and\r\n    seven are known. The amylic alcohols are identical in their chemical\r\n    composition, but differ in certain physical properties, primary\r\n    amylic alcohol boiling at 137°, and iso-amyl alcohol at 131·6°. The\r\n    latter has a specific gravity of ·8148, and is the variety produced\r\n    by fermentation and present in fusel oil.\r\n\r\n    § 166. The experiments of Eulenberg[153] on rabbits, Cross[154] on\r\n    pigeons, Rabuteau[155] on frogs, and Furst on rabbits, with those of\r\n    Sir B. W. Richardson[156] on various animals, have shown it to be a\r\n    powerful poison, more especially if breathed in a state of vapour.\r\n\r\n[153] _Gewerbe Hygiene_, 1876, p. 440.\r\n\r\n[154] _De l’Alcohol Amylique et Méthyl sur l’Organisme (Thèse)_,\r\nStrasburg, 1863.\r\n\r\n[155] “Ueber die Wirkung des Aethyl, Butyl u. Amyl Alcohols,” _L’Union_,\r\nNos. 90, 91, 1870. Schmidt’s _Jahrb._, Bd. 149, p. 263.\r\n\r\n[156] _Trans. Brit. Association_, 1864, 1865, and 1866. Also, _Brit. and\r\nForeign Med. Chir. Rev._, Jan. 7, 1867, p. 247.\r\n\r\n    Richardson, as the result of his investigations, considers that amyl\r\n    alcohol when breathed sets up quite a peculiar class of symptoms\r\n    which last for many hours, and are of such a character, that it\r\n    might be thought impossible for the animal to recover, although they\r\n    have not been known to prove fatal. There is muscular paralysis with\r\n    paroxysms of tremulous convulsions; the spasms are excited by\r\n    touching the animal, breathing upon it, or otherwise subjecting it\r\n    to trifling excitation.\r\n\r\n    § 167. Hitherto, neither the impure fusel oil, nor the purer\r\n    chemical preparation, has had any toxicological importance. Should\r\n    it be necessary at any time to recover small quantities from organic\r\n    liquids, the easiest way is to shake the liquid up with chloroform,\r\n    which readily dissolves amylic alcohol, and on evaporation leaves it\r\n    in a state pure enough to be identified. Amyl alcohol is identified\r\n    by the following tests:--(1) Its physical properties; (2) if warmed\r\n    with twice its volume of strong sulphuric acid, a rose or red colour\r\n    is produced; (3) heated with an acetate and strong sulphuric acid,\r\n    _amyl acetate_, which has the odour of the jargonelle pear, is\r\n    formed; (4) heated with sulphuric acid and potassic dichromate,\r\n    valeric aldehyde is first produced, and then valeric acid is formed;\r\n    the latter has a most peculiar and strong odour.\r\n\r\n    § 168. =Amyl Nitrite, Iso-amyl Ester Nitrite= (C₅H₁₁NO₂).--Boiling\r\n    point 97° to 99°, specific gravity ·877. Amyl nitrite is a limpid,\r\n    and, generally, slightly yellow liquid; it has a peculiar and\r\n    characteristic odour. On heating with alcoholic potash, the products\r\n    are nitrite of potash and amylic alcohol; the amylic alcohol may be\r\n    distilled off and identified. The presence of a nitrite in the\r\n    alkaline solution is readily shown by the colour produced, by adding\r\n    a few drops of a solution of meta-phenylenediamine.\r\n\r\n    Sir B. W. Richardson and others have investigated the action of amyl\r\n    nitrite, as well as that of the acetate and iodide; they all act in\r\n    a similar manner, the nitrite being most potent. After absorption,\r\n    the effects of amyl nitrite are especially seen on the heart and\r\n    circulation: the heart acts violently, there is first dilatation of\r\n    the capillaries, then this is followed by diminished action of the\r\n    heart and contraction of the capillaries.\r\n\r\n    According to Richardson, it suspends the animation of frogs. No\r\n    other substance known will thus suspend a frog’s animation for so\r\n    long a time without killing it. Under favourable circumstances, the\r\n    animal will remain apparently dead for many days, and yet recover.\r\n    Warm-blooded animals may be thrown by amyl nitrite into a cataleptic\r\n    condition. It is not an anæsthetic, and by its use consciousness is\r\n    not destroyed, unless a condition approaching death be first\r\n    produced. When this occurs there is rarely recovery, the animal\r\n    passes into actual death.\r\n\r\n    =Post-Mortem Appearances.=--If administered quickly, the lungs and\r\n    all the other organs are found blanched and free from blood, the\r\n    right side of the heart gorged with blood, the left empty, the brain\r\n    being free from congestion. If administered slowly, the brain is\r\n    found congested, and there is blood both on the left and right sides\r\n    of the heart.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.--Ether.\r\n\r\n§ 169. =Ether, Ethylic Ether, Ethyl Oxide,= (C₂H₅)₂O.--Ethylic ether is\r\na highly mobile liquid of peculiar penetrating odour and sweetish\r\npungent taste. It is perfectly colourless, and evaporates so rapidly,\r\nthat when applied in the form of spray to the skin, the latter becomes\r\nfrozen, and is thus deprived of sensibility.\r\n\r\nPure ether has a density of ·713, its boiling-point is 35°, but\r\ncommercial samples, which often contain water (1 part of water is\r\nsoluble in 35 of ether), may have a higher gravity, and also a higher\r\nboiling-point. The readiest way to know whether an ether is anhydrous or\r\nnot, is to shake it up with a little carbon disulphide. If it is\r\nhydrous, the mixture is milky. Methylated ether is largely used in\r\ncommerce; its disagreeable odour is due to contamination by methylated\r\ncompounds; otherwise the ether made from methylated spirit is ethylic\r\nether, for methylic ether is a gas which escapes during the process.\r\nHence the term “methylated” ether is misleading, for it contains no\r\nmethylic ether, but is essentially a somewhat impure ethylic ether.\r\n\r\n§ 170. =Ether as a Poison.=--Ether has but little toxicological\r\nimportance. There are a few cases of death from its use as an\r\nanæsthetic, and a few cases of suicide. Ether is used by some people as\r\na stimulant, but ether drinkers are uncommon. It causes an intoxication\r\nvery similar to that of alcohol, but of brief duration. In a case of\r\nchronic ether-taking recorded by Martin,[157] in which a woman took\r\ndaily doses of ether for the purpose of allaying a gastric trouble, the\r\npatient suffered from shivering or trembling of the hands and feet,\r\nmuscular weakness, cramp in the calves of the legs, pain in the breast\r\nand back, intermittent headaches, palpitation, singing in the ears,\r\nvomitings, and wakefulness; the ether being discontinued, the patient\r\nrecovered. In one of Orfila’s experiments, half an ounce of ether was\r\nadministered to a dog. The animal died insensible in three hours. The\r\nmucous membrane of the stomach was found highly inflamed, the\r\ninflammation extending somewhat into the duodenum; the rest of the canal\r\nwas healthy. The lungs were gorged with fluid blood.\r\n\r\n[157] Virchow’s _Jahresber._, 1870.\r\n\r\n§ 171. =Fatal Dose.=--The fatal dose of ether, when taken as a liquid,\r\nis not known. 4 grms. (1·28 drms.) cause toxic symptoms, but the effect\r\nsoon passes. Buchanan has seen a brandy-drinker consume 25 grms. (7\r\ndrms.) and yet survive. It is probable that most adults would be killed\r\nby a fluid ounce (28·4 c.c.).\r\n\r\n§ 172. =Ether as an Anæsthetic.=--Ether is now much used as an\r\nanæsthetic, and generally in conjunction with chloroform. Anæsthesia by\r\nether is said to compare favourably with that produced by chloroform. In\r\n92,000 cases of operations performed under ether, the proportion dying\r\nfrom the effects of the anæsthetic was only ·3 per 10,000 (Morgan),\r\nwhile chloroform gives a higher number (see p. 149). The mortality in\r\nAmerica, again, from a mixture of chloroform and ether in 11,000 cases\r\nis reckoned at 1·7 per 10,000; but this proportion is rather above some\r\nof the calculations relative to the mortality from pure chloroform, so\r\nthat the question can hardly be considered settled. The symptoms of\r\nether narcosis are very similar to those produced by chloroform. The\r\nchief point of difference appears to be its action on the heart. Ether,\r\nwhen first breathed, stimulates the heart’s action, and the\r\nafter-depression that follows never reaches so high a grade as with\r\nchloroform. Ether is said to kill by paralysing the respiration, and in\r\ncases which end fatally the breathing is seen to stop suddenly:\r\nconvulsions have not been noticed. The _post-mortem_ appearances, as in\r\nthe case of chloroform, are not characteristic.\r\n\r\n§ 173. =Separation of Ether from Organic Fluids, &c.=--Despite the low\r\nboiling-point of ether, it is by no means easy to separate it from\r\norganic substances _so as to recover the whole of the ether present_.\r\nThe best way is to place the matters in a flask connected with an\r\nordinary Liebig’s condenser, the tube of the latter at its farther end\r\nfitting closely into the doubly perforated cork of a flask. Into the\r\nsecond perforation is adapted an upright tube about 2 feet long, which\r\nmay be of small diameter, and must be surrounded by a freezing mixture\r\nof ice and salt. The upper end of this tube is closed by a thistle-head\r\nfunnel with syphon, and in the bend of the syphon a little mercury\r\nserves as a valve. Heat is now applied to the flask by means of a\r\nwater-bath, and continued for several hours; the liquid which has\r\ndistilled over is then treated with dry calcic chloride and redistilled\r\nexactly in the same way. To this distillate again a similar process may\r\nbe used, substituting dry potassic carbonate for the calcic chloride. It\r\nis only by operating on these principles that the expert can recover in\r\nan approximate state of anhydrous purity such a volatile liquid. Having\r\nthus obtained it pure, it may be identified (1) by its smell, (2) by its\r\nboiling-point, (3) by its inflammability, and (4) by its reducing\r\nchromic acid. The latter test may be applied to the vapour. An asbestos\r\nfibre is soaked in a mixture of strong sulphuric acid and potassic\r\ndichromate, and then placed in the tube connected with the flask--the\r\nethereal (or alcoholic) vapour passing over the fibre, immediately\r\nreduces the chromic acid to chromic oxide, with the production of a\r\ngreen colour.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.--Chloroform.\r\n\r\nCHLOROFORM, TRICHLOROMETHANE OR METHENYL CHLORIDE (CHCl₃).\r\n\r\n§ 174. Chloroform appears to have been discovered independently by\r\nSoubeiran and Liebig, about 1830. It was first employed in medicine by\r\nSimpson, of Edinburgh, as an anæsthetic. Pure chloroform has a density\r\nof 1·491 at 17°, and boils at 60·8°; but commercial samples have\r\ngravities of from 1·47 to 1·491. It is a colourless liquid, strongly\r\nrefracting light; it cannot be ignited by itself, but, when mixed with\r\nalcohol, burns with a smoky flame edged with green. Its odour is heavy,\r\nbut rather pleasant; the taste is sweet and burning.\r\n\r\nChloroform sinks in water, and is only slightly soluble in that fluid\r\n(·44 in 100 c.c.), it is perfectly neutral in reaction, and very\r\nvolatile. When rubbed on the skin, it should completely evaporate,\r\nleaving no odour. Pure absolute chloroform gives an opaline mixture if\r\nmixed with from 1 to 5 volumes of alcohol, but with any quantity above 5\r\nvolumes the mixture is clear; it mixes in all proportions with ether.\r\nChloroform coagulates albumen, and is an excellent solvent for most\r\norganic bases--camphor, caoutchouc, amber, opal, and all common resins.\r\nIt dissolves phosphorus and sulphur slightly--more freely iodine and\r\nbromine. It floats on hydric sulphate, which only attacks it at a\r\nboiling heat.\r\n\r\nChloroform is frequently impure from faulty manufacture or\r\ndecomposition. The impurities to be sought are alcohol, methylated\r\nchloroform,[158] dichloride of ethylene (C₂H₄Cl₂), chloride of ethyl\r\n(C₂H₅Cl), aldehyde, chlorine, hydrochloric, hypochlorous, and traces of\r\nsulphuric acid: there have also been found chlorinated oils. One of the\r\nbest tests for contamination by alcohol, wood spirit, or ether, is that\r\nknown as Roussin’s; dinitrosulphide of iron[159] is added to chloroform.\r\nIf it contain any of these impurities, it acquires a dark colour, but if\r\npure, remains bright and colourless.\r\n\r\n[158] Methylated chloroform is that which is prepared from methylated\r\nspirit. It is liable to more impurities than that made from pure\r\nalcohol, but, of course, its composition is the same, and it has\r\nrecently been manufactured from this source almost chemically pure.\r\n\r\n[159] Made by slowly adding ferric sulphate to a boiling solution of\r\nammonic sulphide and potassic nitrite, as long as the precipitate\r\ncontinues to redissolve, and then filtering the solution.\r\n\r\nThe presence of alcohol or ether, or both, may also be discovered by the\r\nbichromate test, which is best applied as follows:--A few milligrammes\r\nof potassic bichromate are placed at the bottom of a test-tube with four\r\nor five drops of sulphuric acid, which liberates the chromic acid; next,\r\na very little water is added to dissolve the chromic acid; and lastly,\r\nthe chloroform. The whole is now shaken, and allowed to separate. If the\r\nchloroform is pure, the mass is hardly tinged a greenish-yellow, and no\r\nlayer separates. If, however, there is anything like 5 per cent. of\r\nalcohol or ether present, the deep green of chromium chloride appears,\r\nand there is a distinct layer at the bottom of the tube.\r\n\r\nAnother way to detect alcohol in chloroform, and also to make an\r\napproximate estimation of its quantity, is to place 20 c.c. of\r\nchloroform in a burette, and then add 80 c.c. of water. On shaking\r\nviolently, pure chloroform will sink to the bottom in clear globules,\r\nand the measurement will be as nearly as possible the original quantity;\r\nbut if anything like a percentage of alcohol be present, the chloroform\r\nis seen to be diminished in quantity, and its surface is opalescent, the\r\ndiminution being caused by the water dissolving out the alcohol. The\r\naddition of a few drops of potash solution destroys the meniscus, and\r\nallows of a close reading of the volume. The supernatant water may be\r\nutilised for the detection of other impurities, and tested for sulphuric\r\nacid by baric chloride, for free chlorine and hypochlorous acid by\r\nstarch and potassic iodide, and for hydrochloric acid by silver\r\nnitrate.[160] Fuchsine, proposed by Stœdeler, is also a delicate reagent\r\nfor the presence of alcohol in chloroform, the sample becoming red in\r\nthe presence of alcohol, and the tint being proportionate to the\r\nquantity present. The most delicate test for alcohol is, however, the\r\niodoform test fully described in “Foods,” p. 375.[161] Dichloride of\r\nethylene is detected by shaking up the chloroform with dry potassic\r\ncarbonate, and then adding metallic potassium. This does not act on pure\r\nchloroform, but only in presence of ethylene dichloride, when the\r\ngaseous chlor-ethylene (C₂H₃Cl) is evolved. Ethyl-chloride is detected\r\nby distilling the chloroform and collecting the first portions of the\r\ndistillate; it will have a distinct odour of ethyl-chloride should it be\r\npresent. Methyl compounds and empyreumatic oils are roughly detected by\r\nallowing the chloroform to evaporate on a cloth. If present, the cloth,\r\nwhen the chloroform has evaporated, will have a peculiar disagreeable\r\nodour. Aldehyde is recognised by its reducing action on argentic\r\nnitrate; the mineral acids by the reddening of litmus paper, and the\r\nappropriate tests. Hypochlorous acid first reddens, and then bleaches,\r\nlitmus-paper.\r\n\r\n[160] Neither an alcoholic nor an aqueous solution of silver nitrate\r\ncauses the slightest change in pure chloroform.\r\n\r\n[161] An attempt has been made by Besnou to estimate the amount of\r\nalcohol by the specific gravity. He found that a chloroform of 1·4945\r\ngravity, mixed with 5 per cent. of alcohol, gave a specific gravity of\r\n1·4772; 10 per cent., 1·4602; 20 per cent., 1·4262; and 25 per cent.,\r\n1·4090. It would, therefore, seem that every percentage of alcohol\r\nlowers the gravity by ·0034.\r\n\r\nDr. Dott, _Pharm. Journ._, 1894, p. 629, gives the following\r\ntests:--Specific gravity, 1·490 to 1·495. On allowing ½ fluid drm. to\r\nevaporate from a clean surface, no foreign odour is perceptible at any\r\nstage of the evaporation. When 1 fluid drm. is agitated with an equal\r\nvolume of solution of silver nitrate, no precipitate or turbidity is\r\nproduced after standing for five minutes. On shaking up the chloroform\r\nwith half its volume of distilled water, the water should not redden\r\nlitmus-paper. When shaken with an equal volume of sulphuric acid, little\r\nor no colour should be imparted to the acid.\r\n\r\n§ 175. The ordinary method of manufacturing chloroform is by distilling\r\nalcohol with chlorinated lime; but another mode is now much in\r\nuse--viz., the decomposition of chloral hydrate. By distilling it with a\r\nweak alkali, this process yields such a pure chloroform, that, for\r\nmedicinal purposes, it should supersede every other.\r\n\r\n\r\nPoisonous Effects of Chloroform.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. AS A LIQUID.\r\n\r\n§ 176. =Statistics.=--Falck finds recorded in medical literature 27\r\ncases of poisoning by chloroform having been swallowed--of these 15 were\r\nmen, 9 were women, and 3 children. Eighteen of the cases were suicidal,\r\nand 10 of the 18 died; the remainder took the liquid by mistake.\r\n\r\n§ 177. =Local Action of Chloroform.=--When applied to the skin or mucous\r\nmembranes in such a way that the fluid cannot evaporate--as, for\r\nexample, by means of a cloth steeped in chloroform laid on the bare\r\nskin, and covered over with some impervious material--there is a burning\r\nsensation, which soon ceases, and leaves the part anæsthetised, while\r\nthe skin, at the same time, is reddened and sometimes even blistered.\r\n\r\n§ 178. Chloroform added to blood, or passed through it in the state of\r\nvapour, causes it to assume a peculiar brownish colour owing to\r\ndestruction of the red corpuscles and solution of the hæmoglobin in the\r\nplasma. The change does not require the presence of atmospheric air, but\r\ntakes place equally in an atmosphere of hydrogen. It has been shown by\r\nSchmiedeberg that the chloroform enters in some way into a state of\r\ncombination with the blood-corpuscles, for the entire quantity cannot be\r\nrecovered by distillation; whereas the plasma, similarly treated, yields\r\nthe entire quantity which has in the first place been added.\r\nSchmiedeberg also asserts that the oxygen is in firmer combination with\r\nthe chloroformised blood than usual, as shown by its slow extraction by\r\nstannous oxide. Muscle, exposed to chloroform liquid by arterial\r\ninjection, quickly loses excitability and becomes rigid. Nerves are\r\nfirst stimulated, and then their function for the time is annihilated;\r\nbut on evaporation of the chloroform, the function is restored.\r\n\r\n§ 179. =General Effects of the Liquid.=--However poisonous in a state of\r\nvapour, chloroform cannot be considered an extremely active poison when\r\ntaken into the stomach as a liquid, for enormous quantities, relatively,\r\nhave been drunk without fatal effect. Thus, there is the case recorded\r\nby Taylor, in which a man, who had swallowed 113·4 grms. (4 ozs.),\r\nwalked a considerable distance after taking the dose. He subsequently\r\nfell into a state of coma, with dilated pupils, stertorous breathing,\r\nand imperceptible pulse. These symptoms were followed by convulsions,\r\nbut the patient recovered in five days.\r\n\r\nIn a case related by Burkart,[162] a woman desired to kill herself with\r\nchloroform, and procured for that purpose 50 grms. (a little less than\r\none ounce and a half); she drank some of it, but the burning taste and\r\nthe sense of heat in the mouth, throat, and stomach, prevented her from\r\ntaking the whole at once. After a few moments, the pain passing off, she\r\nessayed to drink the remainder, and did swallow the greater portion of\r\nit, but was again prevented by the suffering it caused. Finally, she\r\npoured what remained on a cloth, and placing it over her face, soon sank\r\ninto a deep narcosis. She was found lying on the bed very pale, with\r\nblue lips, and foaming a little at the mouth; the head was rigidly bent\r\nbackwards, the extremities were lax, the eyes were turned upwards and\r\ninwards, the pupils dilated and inactive, the face and extremities were\r\ncold, the body somewhat warmer, there was no pulse at the wrist, the\r\ncarotids beat feebly, the breathing was deep and rattling, and after\r\nfive or six inspirations ceased. By the aid of artificial respiration,\r\n&c., she recovered in an hour.\r\n\r\n[162] _Vierteljahrsschr. für ger. Med._, 1876.\r\n\r\nA still larger dose has been recovered from in the case of a young man,\r\naged 23,[163] who had swallowed no less than 75 grms. (2·6 ozs.) of\r\nchloroform, but yet, in a few hours, awoke from the stupor. He\r\ncomplained of a burning pain in the stomach; on the following day he\r\nsuffered from vomiting, and on the third day symptoms of jaundice\r\nappeared,--a feature which has been several times noticed as an effect\r\nof chloroform.\r\n\r\n[163] _Brit. Med. Journ._, 1879.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, even small doses have been known to destroy life. In\r\na case related by Taylor, a boy, aged 4, swallowed 3·8 grms. (1 drm.) of\r\nchloroform and died in three hours, notwithstanding that every effort\r\nwas used for his recovery.\r\n\r\n§ 180. The smallest dose that has proved fatal _to an adult_ is 15 grms.\r\n(a little over 4 drms.).\r\n\r\nFrom twenty-two cases in which the quantity taken had been ascertained\r\nwith some degree of accuracy, Falck draws the following conclusions:--In\r\neight of the cases the dose was between 4 and 30 grms., and one death\r\nresulted from 15 grms. As for the other fourteen persons, the doses\r\nvaried from 35 to 380 grms., and eight of these patients died--two after\r\n40, two after 45, one after 60, 90, 120, and 180 grms. respectively.\r\nHence, under conditions favouring the action of the poison, 15 grms.\r\n(4·3 drms.) may be fatal to an adult, while doses of 40 grms. (11·3\r\ndrms.) and upwards will almost certainly kill.\r\n\r\n§ 181. =Symptoms.=--The symptoms can be well gathered from the cases\r\nquoted. They commence shortly after the taking of the poison; and,\r\nindeed, the local action of the liquid immediately causes first a\r\nburning sensation, followed by numbness.\r\n\r\nOften after a few minutes, precisely as when the vapour is administered,\r\na peculiar, excited condition supervenes, accompanied, it may be, by\r\ndelirium. The next stage is narcosis, and the patient lies with pale\r\nface and livid lips, &c., as described at p. 147; the end of the scene\r\nis often preceded by convulsions. Sometimes, however, consciousness\r\nreturns, and the irritation of the mucous membranes of the\r\ngastro-intestinal canal is shown by bloody vomiting and bloody stools,\r\nwith considerable pain and general suffering. In this way, a person may\r\nlinger several days after the ingestion of the poison. In a case\r\nobserved by Pomeroy, the fatal malady was prolonged for eight days.\r\nAmong those who recover, a common _sequela_, as before mentioned, is\r\njaundice.\r\n\r\nA third form of symptoms has been occasionally observed, viz.:--The\r\nperson awakes from the coma, the breathing and pulse become again\r\nnatural, and all danger seems to have passed, when suddenly, after a\r\nlonger or shorter time, without warning, a state of general depression\r\nand collapse supervenes, and death occurs.\r\n\r\n§ 182. =Post-mortem Appearances.=--The _post-mortem_ appearances from a\r\nfatal dose of liquid chloroform mainly resolve themselves into redness\r\nof the mucous membrane of the stomach, though occasionally, as in\r\nPomeroy’s case, there may be an ulceration. In a case recorded by\r\nHoffman,[164] a woman, aged 30, drank 35 to 40 grms. of chloroform and\r\ndied within the hour. Almost the whole of the chloroform taken was found\r\nin the stomach, as a heavy fluid, coloured green, through the bile. The\r\nepithelium of the pharynx, epiglottis, and gullet was of a dirty colour,\r\npartly detached, whitened, softened, and easily stripped off. The mucous\r\nmembrane of the stomach was much altered in colour and consistence, and,\r\nwith the duodenum, was covered with a tenacious grey slime. There was no\r\necchymosis.\r\n\r\n[164] _Lehrbuch der ger. Medicin_, 2te Aufl.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. THE VAPOUR OF CHLOROFORM.\r\n\r\n§ 183. =Statistics.=--Accidents occur far more frequently in the use of\r\nchloroform vapour for anæsthetic purposes than in the use of the liquid.\r\n\r\nMost of the cases of death through chloroform vapour, are those caused\r\naccidentally in surgical and medical practice. A smaller number are\r\nsuicidal, while for criminal purposes, its use is extremely infrequent.\r\n\r\nThe percentage of deaths caused by chloroform administered during\r\noperations is unaccountably different in different years, times, and\r\nplaces. The diversity of opinion on the subject is partly (though not\r\nentirely) explicable, by the degrees of purity in the anæsthetic\r\nadministered, the different modes of administration, the varying lengths\r\nof time of the anæsthesia, and the varying severity of the operations.\r\n\r\nDuring the Crimean War, according to Baudens and Quesnoy, 30,000\r\noperations were done under chloroform, but only one death occurred\r\nattributable to the anæsthetic. Sansom[165] puts the average mortality\r\nat ·75 per 10,000, Nussbaum at 1·3, Richardson at 2·8,[166] Morgan[167]\r\nat 3·4. In the American war of secession, in 11,000 operations, there\r\nwere seven deaths--that is, 6·3 per 10,000, the highest number on a\r\nlarge scale which appears to be on record. In the ten years 1883-1892,\r\n103 deaths are attributed to chloroform in England and Wales, viz., 88\r\ndeaths (57 males, 31 females) from accidents (no doubt in its use as a\r\ngeneral anæsthetic), 14 (9 males, 5 females) from suicide, and a\r\nsolitary case of murder.\r\n\r\n[165] _Chloroform: its Action, &c._, London, 1865.\r\n\r\n[166] _Med. Times and Gazette_, 1870.\r\n\r\n[167] _Med. Soc. of Virginia_, 1872.\r\n\r\n§ 184. =Suicidal and Criminal Poisoning by Chloroform.=--Suicidal\r\npoisoning by chloroform will generally be indicated by the surrounding\r\ncircumstances; and in no case hitherto reported has there been any\r\ndifficulty or obscurity as to whether the narcosis was self-induced or\r\nnot. An interesting case is related by Schauenstein,[168] in which a\r\nphysician resolved to commit suicide by chloroform, a commencing\r\namaurosis having preyed upon his mind, and his choice having been\r\ndetermined by witnessing an accidental death by this agent. He\r\naccordingly plugged his nostrils, fitted on to the face an appropriate\r\nmask, and fastened it by strips of adhesive plaster. In such an\r\ninstance, there could be no doubt of the suicidal intent, and the\r\nquestion of accident would be entirely out of the question.\r\n\r\n[168] Maschka: _Handbuch der gerichtlich. Medicin_, p. 787, Tübingen,\r\n1882.\r\n\r\nA dentist in Potsdam,[169] in a state of great mental depression from\r\nembarrassed circumstances, killed his wife, himself, and two children by\r\nchloroform. Such crimes are fortunately very rare.\r\n\r\n[169] Casper: _Handbuch der ger. Med._\r\n\r\nThere is a vulgar idea that it is possible, by holding a cloth saturated\r\nwith chloroform to the mouth of a sleeping person (or one, indeed,\r\nperfectly awake), to produce _sudden_ insensibility; but such an\r\noccurrence is against all experimental and clinical evidence. It is true\r\nthat a nervous person might, under such circumstances, faint and become\r\ninsensible by mere nervous shock; but a true sudden narcosis is\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nDolbeau has made some interesting experiments in order to ascertain\r\nwhether, under any circumstances, a sleeping person might be\r\nanæsthetised. The main result appears to answer the question in the\r\naffirmative, at least with certain persons; but even with these, it can\r\nonly be done by using the greatest skill and care, first allowing the\r\nsleeper to breathe very dilute chloroform vapour, and then gradually\r\nexhibiting stronger doses, and taking the cloth or inhaler away on the\r\nslightest symptom of approaching wakefulness. In 75 per cent. of the\r\ncases, however, the individuals awoke almost immediately on being\r\nexposed to the vapour. This cautious and scientific narcosis, then, is\r\nnot likely to be used by the criminal class, or, if used, to be\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\n§ 185. =Physiological Effects.=--Chloroform is a protoplasmic poison.\r\nAccording to Jumelle, plants can even be narcotised, ceasing to\r\nassimilate and no longer being sensitive to the stimulus of light.\r\nIsolated animal cells, like leucocytes, lose through chloroform vapour\r\ntheir power of spontaneous movement, and many bacteria cease to multiply\r\nif in contact with chloroform water. According to Binx, chloroform\r\nnarcosis in man is to be explained through its producing a weak\r\ncoagulation of the cerebral ganglion cells. As already mentioned,\r\nchloroform has an affinity for the red blood-corpuscles. Chloroform\r\nstimulates the peripheral ends of the nerves of sensation, so that it\r\ncauses irritation of the skin or mucous membranes when locally applied.\r\nFlourens considers that chloroform first affects the cerebrum, then the\r\ncerebellum, and finally the spinal cord; the action is at first\r\nstimulating, afterwards paralysing. Most anæsthetics diminish equally\r\nthe excitability of the grey and the white nervous substance of the\r\nbrain, and this is the case with chloroform, ether, and morphine; but\r\napparently this is not the case with chloral hydrate, which only\r\ndiminishes the conductivity of the cortical substance of the brain, and\r\nleaves the grey substance intact. Corresponding to the cerebral\r\nparalysis, the blood pressure sinks, and the heart beats slower and\r\nweaker.[170] The Hyderabad Commission made 735 researches on dogs and\r\nmonkeys, and found that in fatal narcosis, so far as these animals are\r\nconcerned, the respiration ceased before the heart, and this may be\r\nconsidered the normal mode of death; but it is probably going too far to\r\nsay that it is the exclusive form of death in man, for there have been\r\npublished cases in which the heart failed first.\r\n\r\n[170] Kobert’s _Lehrbuch der Intoxicationen_.\r\n\r\n§ 186. =Symptoms.=--There is but little outward difference between man\r\nand animals, in regard to the symptoms caused by breathing chloroform;\r\nin the former we have the advantage that the sensations preceding\r\nnarcosis can be described by the individual.\r\n\r\nThe action of chloroform is usually divided into three more or less\r\ndistinct stages. In the _first_ there is a “drunken” condition, changes\r\nin the sense of smell and taste, and it may be hallucinations of vision\r\nand hearing; there are also often curious creeping sensations about the\r\nskin, and sometimes excessive muscular action, causing violent\r\nstruggles. I have also seen epileptiform convulsions, and delirium is\r\nalmost always present. The face during this stage is generally flushed,\r\ncovered with perspiration, and the pupils contracted. The first stage\r\nmay last from one minute to several, and passes into the _second stage_,\r\nor that of depression. Spontaneous movements cease, sensibility to all\r\nexternal stimuli vanishes, the patient falls into a deep sleep, the\r\nconsciousness is entirely lost, and reflex movements are more and more\r\nannihilated. The temperature is less than normal, the respirations are\r\nslow, and the pulse is full and slow. The pupils in this stage are\r\nusually dilated, all the muscles are relaxed, and the limbs can be bent\r\nabout in any direction. If now the inhalation of chloroform is\r\nintermitted, the patient wakes within a period which is usually from\r\ntwenty to forty minutes, but may be several hours, after the last\r\ninhalation.\r\n\r\nThe _third stage_ is that of paralysis; the pulse becomes irregular, the\r\nrespirations superficial, there is a cyanotic colouring of the lips and\r\nskin, while the pupils become widely dilated. Death follows quickly\r\nthrough paralysis of the respiratory centre, the respirations first\r\nceasing, then the pulse; in a few cases, the heart ceases first to beat.\r\n\r\nAccording to Sansom’s facts,[171] in 100 cases of death by chloroform,\r\n44·6 per cent. occurred before the full narcosis had been attained, that\r\nis in the first stage, 34·7 during the second stage, and 20·6 shortly\r\nafter. So, also, Kappeler has recorded that in 101 cases of death from\r\nchloroform, 47·7 per cent. occurred before the full effect, and 52·2\r\nduring the full effect. This confirms the dictum of Billroth, that in\r\nall stages of anæsthesia by chloroform, death may occur. The _quantity_\r\nof chloroform, which, when inhaled in a given time, will produce death,\r\nis unknown; for all depends upon the greater or less admixture of air,\r\nand probably on other conditions. It has been laid down, that the\r\ninhalation of chloroform should be so managed as to insure that the air\r\nbreathed shall never contain more than 3·9 per cent. of chloroform.\r\nFifteen drops have caused death, but Taylor, on the other hand, records\r\na case of tetanus, treated at Guy’s Hospital, in which no less a\r\nquantity than 700 grms. (22·5 ozs.) was inhaled in twenty-four hours.\r\nFrequent breathing of chloroform in no way renders the individual safe\r\nfrom fatal accident. A lady[172] having repeatedly taken chloroform, was\r\nanæsthetised by the same agent merely for the purpose of having a tooth\r\nextracted. About 6 grms. (1·5 drm.) were poured on a cloth, and after\r\nnine to ten inspirations, dangerous symptoms began--rattling breathing\r\nand convulsive movements--and, despite all remedies, she died.\r\n\r\n[171] _Op. cit._\r\n\r\n[172] _Edin. Med. Journ._, 1855.\r\n\r\n§ 187. Chronic chloroform poisoning is not unknown. It leads to various\r\nailments, and seems to have been in one or two instances the cause of\r\ninsanity.\r\n\r\nBuchner records the case of an opium-eater, who afterwards took to\r\nchloroform; he suffered from periodic mania. In a remarkable case\r\nrelated by Meric, the patient, who had also first been a morphine-eater,\r\ntook 350 grms. of chloroform in five days by inhalation; as often as he\r\nwoke he would chloroform himself again to sleep. In this case, there was\r\nalso mental disturbance, and instances in which chloroform produced\r\nmarked mental aberration are recorded by Böhm[173] and by Vigla.[174]\r\n\r\n[173] Ziemssen’s _Handbuch_, Bd. 15.\r\n\r\n[174] _Med. Times_, 1855.\r\n\r\n§ 188. =Post-mortem Appearances.=--The lesions found on section are\r\nneither peculiar to, nor characteristic of, chloroform poisoning. It has\r\nbeen noted that bubbles of gas are, from time to time, to be observed\r\nafter death in the blood of those poisoned by chloroform, but it is\r\ndoubtful whether the bubbles are not merely those to be found in any\r\nother corpse--in 189 cases, only eighteen times were these gas-bubbles\r\nobserved,[175] so that, even if they are characteristic, the chances in\r\na given case that they will _not_ be seen are greater than the reverse.\r\nThe smell of chloroform may be present, but has been noticed very\r\nseldom.\r\n\r\n[175] Schauenstein (_Op. cit._).\r\n\r\n§ 189. =The detection and estimation of chloroform= from organic\r\nsubstances is not difficult, its low boiling-point causing it to distil\r\nreadily. Accordingly (whatever may be the ultimate modifications, as\r\nsuggested by different experimenters), the first step is to bring the\r\nsubstances, unless fluid, into a pulp with water, and submit this pulp\r\nto distillation by the heat of a water-bath. If the liquid operated upon\r\npossesses no particular odour, the chloroform may in this way be\r\nrecognised in the distillate, which, if necessary, may be redistilled in\r\nthe same manner, so as to concentrate the volatile matters in a small\r\ncompass.\r\n\r\nThere are four chief tests for the identification of chloroform:--\r\n\r\n(1.) The final distillate is tested with a little aniline, and an\r\nalcoholic solution of soda or potash lye; either immediately, or upon\r\ngently warming the liquid, there is a peculiar and penetrating odour of\r\nphenylcarbylamine, C₆H₅NC; it is produced by the following reaction:--\r\n\r\n  CHCl₃ + 3KOH + C₆H₅NH₂ = C₆H₅NC + 3KCl + 3H₂O.\r\n\r\nChloral, trichloracetic acid, bromoform and iodoform also give the same\r\nreaction; on the other hand, ethylidene chloride does not yield under\r\nthese circumstances any carbylamine (isonitrile).\r\n\r\n(2.) Chloroform reduces Fehling’s alkaline copper solution, _when\r\napplied to a distillate_, thus excluding a host of more fixed bodies\r\nwhich have the same reaction; it is a very excellent test, and may be\r\nmade quantitative. The reaction is as follows:--\r\n\r\n  CHCl₃ + 5KHO + 2CuO = Cu₂O + K₂CO₃ + 3KCl + 3H₂O;\r\n\r\nthus, every 100 parts of cuprous oxide equals 83·75 of chloroform.\r\n\r\n(3.) The fluid to be tested (which, if acid, should be neutralised), is\r\ndistilled in a slow current of hydrogen, and the vapour conducted\r\nthrough a short bit of red-hot combustion-tube containing platinum\r\ngauze. Under these circumstances, the chloroform is decomposed and\r\nhydrochloric acid formed; hence, the issuing vapour has an acid reaction\r\nto test-paper, and if led into a solution of silver nitrate, gives the\r\nusual precipitate of argentic chloride. Every 100 parts of silver\r\nchloride equal 27·758 of chloroform.\r\n\r\n(4.) The fluid is mixed with a little thymol and potash; if chloroform\r\nbe present, a reddish-violet colour is developed, becoming more distinct\r\non the application of heat.[176]\r\n\r\n[176] S. Vidali in _Deutsch-Amerikan. Apoth.-Zeitung_, vol. iij., Aug.\r\n15, 1882.\r\n\r\n§ 190. For the quantitative estimation of chloroform the method\r\nrecommended by Schmiedeberg[177] is, however, the best. A\r\ncombustion-tube of 24 to 26 cm. long, and 10 to 12 mm. in diameter, open\r\nat both ends, is furnished at the one end with a plug of asbestos, while\r\nthe middle part, to within 5-6 cm. of the other end, is filled with\r\npieces of caustic lime, from the size of a lentil to that of half a pea.\r\nThe lime must be pure, and is made by heating a carbonate which has been\r\nprecipitated from calcic nitrate. The other end of the tube is closed by\r\na cork, carrying a silver tube, 16-18 cm. long, and 4 mm. thick. The end\r\ncontaining the asbestos plug is fitted by a cork to a glass tube. The\r\ncombustion-tube thus prepared is placed in the ordinary\r\ncombustion-furnace; the flask containing the chloroform is adapted, and\r\nthe distillation slowly proceeded with. It is best to add a tube, bent\r\nat right angles and going to the bottom of the flask, to draw air\r\ncontinuously through the apparatus. During the whole process, the tube\r\ncontaining the lime is kept at a red heat. The chloroform is decomposed,\r\nand the chlorine combines with the lime. The resulting calcic chloride,\r\nmixed with much unchanged lime, is, at the end of the operation, cooled,\r\ndissolved in dilute nitric acid, and precipitated with silver nitrate.\r\nAny silver chloride is collected and weighed and calculated into\r\nchloroform.[178]\r\n\r\n[177] _Ueber die quantitative Bestimmung des Chloroforms im Blute._\r\nInaug. Dissert., Dorpat, 1866.\r\n\r\n[178] S. Vidali has made the ingenious suggestion of developing hydrogen\r\nin the usual way, by means of zinc and sulphuric acid, in the liquid\r\nsupposed to contain chloroform, to ignite the hydrogen, as in Marsh’s\r\ntest, when it issues from the tube, and then to hold in the flame a\r\nclean copper wire. Since any chloroform is burnt up in the hydrogen\r\nflame to hydrochloric acid, the chloride of copper immediately\r\nvolatilises and colours the flame green.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.--Other Anæsthetics.\r\n\r\n    § 191. When chlorine acts upon marsh-gas, the hydrogen can be\r\n    displaced atom by atom; and from the original methane (CH₄) can be\r\n    successively obtained chloromethane or methyl chloride (CH₃Cl),\r\n    dichloromethane, or methene dichloride, methylene dichloride\r\n    (CH₂Cl₂), trichloromethane, or chloroform (CHCl₃), already\r\n    described, and carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄). All these are, more or\r\n    less, capable of producing anæsthesia; but none of them, save\r\n    chloroform, are of any toxicological importance.\r\n\r\n    Methene dichloride, recommended by Sir B. W. Richardson as an\r\n    anæsthetic, has come somewhat into use. It is a colourless, very\r\n    volatile liquid, of specific gravity 1·360, and boiling at 41°. It\r\n    burns with a smoky flame, and dissolves iodine with a brown colour.\r\n\r\n    § 192. =Pentane= (C₅H₁₂).--There are three isomers of pentane; that\r\n    which is used as an anæsthetic is normal pentane,\r\n    CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃; its boiling-point is 37-38°. It is one of the\r\n    constituents of petroleum ether.\r\n\r\n    Under the name of “Pental” it is used in certain hospitals\r\n    extensively, for instance, at the Kaiser Friederich’s Children’s\r\n    Hospital, Berlin.[179] It is stated to have no action on the heart.\r\n\r\n[179] _Zeit. f. Kinderheilk._, Bd. iii.-iv., 1893.\r\n\r\n    One death[180] has been recorded from its use:--A lad, aged 14, was\r\n    put under pental for the purpose of having two molars painlessly\r\n    extracted. He was only a minute or two insensible, and 4-5 grms. of\r\n    pental was the quantity stated to have been inhaled. The boy spat\r\n    out after the operation, then suddenly fainted and died. The\r\n    _post-mortem_ showed œdema of the lungs; the right side of the heart\r\n    was empty. The organs of the body smelled strongly of pental.\r\n\r\n[180] Dr. Bremme, _Vierteljahrsschr. f. gerichtliche Medicin_, Bd. v.,\r\n1893.\r\n\r\n    § 193. =Aldehyde= (Acetaldehyde), C₂H₄O =\r\n\r\n        O\r\n       //\r\n  CH₃-C   ,\r\n       \\\r\n        H\r\n\r\n    a fluid obtained by the careful oxidation of alcohol (boiling-point,\r\n    20·8°), is in large doses toxic; in smaller, it acts as a narcotic.\r\n\r\n    =Metaldehyde= (C₂H₄O₂)₂, obtained by treating acetaldehyde at a low\r\n    temperature with hydrochloric acid. It occurs in the form of prisms,\r\n    which sublime at about 112°; it is also poisonous.\r\n\r\n    § 194. =Paraldehyde= (C₆H₁₂O₃) is a colourless fluid, boiling at\r\n    124°; specific gravity ·998 at 15°. By the action of cold it may be\r\n    obtained in crystals, the melting point of which is 10·5°. It is\r\n    soluble in eight parts of water at 13°; in warm water it is less\r\n    soluble; hence, on warming a solution, it becomes turbid.\r\n    Paraldehyde acts very similarly to chloral; it causes a deep sleep,\r\n    and (judging by experiments on animals) produces no convulsive\r\n    movements.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.--Chloral.\r\n\r\n§ 195. =Chloral Hydrate= (C₂H₃Cl₃O₂) is made by mixing equivalent\r\nquantities of anhydrous chloral[181] and water. The purest chloral is in\r\nthe form of small, granular, sugar-like crystals. When less pure, the\r\ncrystals are larger. These melt into a clear fluid at from 48° to 49°,\r\nand the melted mass solidifies again at 48·9°. Chloral boils at 97·5°;\r\nit is not very soluble in cold chloroform, requiring four times its\r\nweight. The only substance with which chloral hydrate may well be\r\nconfused is chloral alcoholate (C₄H₇Cl₃O₂), but chloral alcoholate melts\r\nat a lower temperature (45°), and boils at a higher (113·5°); it is\r\neasily soluble in cold chloroform, and inflames readily, whereas chloral\r\nscarcely burns.\r\n\r\n[181] Anhydrous chloral (C₂HCl₃O) is an oily liquid, of specific gravity\r\n1·502 at 18°; it boils at 97·7°. It is obtained by the prolonged action\r\nof chlorine on absolute alcohol.\r\n\r\nChloral hydrate completely volatilises, and can be distilled in a vacuum\r\nwithout change. If, however, boiled in air, it undergoes slow\r\ndecomposition, the first portions of the distillate being overhydrated,\r\nthe last underhydrated; the boiling-point, therefore, undergoes a\r\ncontinuous rise. The amount of hydration of a commercial sample is of\r\npractical importance; if too much water is present, the chloral\r\ndeliquesces, especially in warm weather; if too little, it may become\r\nacid, and in part insoluble from the formation of meta-chloral\r\n(C₆H₃Cl₉O₃). Chloral hydrate, by the action of the volatile or fixed\r\nalkalies, is decomposed, an alkaline formiate and chloroform resulting\r\nthus--\r\n\r\n  C₂HCl₃O,H₂O + NaHO = NaCHO₂ + H₂O + CHCl₃.\r\n\r\nTrichlor-acetic acid is decomposed in a similar manner.\r\n\r\n=Statistics.=--Chloral caused, during the ten years 1883-1892 in England\r\nand Wales, 127 deaths--viz., 111 (89 males, 22 females) accidentally, 15\r\n(14 males, 1 female) from suicide, and a case in which chloral was the\r\nagent of murder.\r\n\r\n§ 196. =Detection.=--It is, of course, obvious that after splitting up\r\nchloral into chloroform, the latter can be detected by distillation and\r\napplying the tests given at p. 152 and _seq._ Chloral hydrate is soluble\r\nin one and a half times its weight of water; the solution should be\r\nperfectly neutral to litmus. It is also soluble in ether, in alcohol,\r\nand in carbon disulphide. It may be extracted from its solution by\r\nshaking out with ether. There should be no cloudiness when a solution is\r\ntested with silver nitrate in the cold; if, however, to a boiling\r\nsolution nitrate of silver and a little ammonia are added, there is a\r\nmirror of reduced silver.\r\n\r\n§ 197. The assay of chloral hydrate in solutions is best effected by\r\ndistilling the solution with slaked lime; the distillate is received in\r\nwater contained in a graduated tube kept at a low temperature. The\r\nchloroform sinks to the bottom, and is directly read off; the number of\r\nc.c. multiplied by 2·064 equals the weight of the chloral hydrate\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nAnother method, accurate but only applicable to the fairly pure\r\nsubstance, is to dissolve 1 to 2 grms. in water, remove any free acid by\r\nbaric carbonate, and then treat the liquid thus purified by a known\r\nvolume of standard soda. The soda is now titrated back, using litmus as\r\nan indicator, each c.c. of normal alkali neutralised by the sample\r\ncorresponds to 0·1655 grm. of chloral hydrate. Small quantities of\r\nchloral hydrate may be conveniently recovered from complex liquids by\r\nshaking them up with ether, and removing the ethereal layer, in the tube\r\nrepresented in the figure.[182] The ether must be allowed to evaporate\r\nspontaneously; but there is in this way much loss of chloral. The best\r\nmethod of estimating minute quantities is to alkalise the liquid, and\r\nslowly distil the vapour through a red-hot combustion-tube charged with\r\npure lime, as in the process described at p. 153. A dilute solution of\r\nchloral may also be treated with a zinc-copper couple, the nascent\r\nhydrogen breaks the molecule up, and the resulting chloride may be\r\ntitrated, as in water analyses, by silver nitrate and potassic chromate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[182] The figure is from “Foods”; the description may be here\r\nrepeated:--A is a tube of any dimensions most convenient to the analyst.\r\nOrdinary burette size will perhaps be the most suitable for routine\r\nwork; the tube is furnished with a stopcock and is bent at B, the tube\r\nat K having a very small but not quite capillary bore. The lower end is\r\nattached to a length of pressure-tubing, and is connected with a small\r\nreservoir of mercury, moving up and down by means of a pulley. To use\r\nthe apparatus: Fill the tube with mercury by opening the clamp at H, and\r\nthe stopcock at B, and raising the reservoir until the mercury, if\r\nallowed, would flow out of the beak. Now, the beak is dipped into the\r\nliquid to be extracted with the solvent, and by lowering the reservoir,\r\na strong vacuum is created, which draws the liquid into the tube; in the\r\nsame way the ether is made to follow. Should the liquid be so thick that\r\nit is not possible to get it in by means of suction, the lower end of\r\nthe tube is disconnected, and the syrupy mass worked in through the wide\r\nend. When the ether has been sucked into the apparatus, it is emptied of\r\nmercury by lowering the reservoir, and then firmly clamped at H, and the\r\nstopcock also closed. The tube may now be shaken, and then allowed to\r\nstand for the liquids to separate. When there is a good line of\r\ndemarcation, by raising the reservoir after opening the clamp and\r\nstopcock, the whole of the light solvent can be run out of the tube into\r\na flask or beaker, and recovered by distillation. For heavy solvents\r\n(such as chloroform), which sink to the bottom, a simple burette, with a\r\nfine exit tube is preferable; but for petroleum ether, ordinary ether,\r\n&c., the apparatus figured is extremely useful.\r\n\r\n§ 198. =Effects of Chloral Hydrate on Animals.=--Experiments on animals\r\nhave taught us all that is known of the physiological action of\r\nchloral. It has been shown that the drug influences very considerably\r\nthe circulation, at first exciting the heart’s action, and then\r\nparalysing the automatic centre. The heart, as in animals poisoned by\r\natropine, stops in diastole, and the blood-pressure sinks in proportion\r\nto the progressive paralysis of the cardiac centre. At the same time,\r\nthe respiration is slowed and finally ceases, while the heart continues\r\nto beat. The body temperature of the warm-blooded animals is very\r\nremarkably depressed, according to Falck, even to 7·6°. Vomiting has\r\nbeen rather frequently observed with dogs and cats, even when the drug\r\nhas been taken into the system by subcutaneous injection.\r\n\r\nThe secretion of milk, according to Röhrig, is also diminished. Reflex\r\nactions through small doses are intensified; through large, much\r\ndiminished. ·025-·05 grm. (·4-·7 grain), injected subcutaneously into\r\nfrogs, causes a slowing of the respiration, a diminution of reflex\r\nexcitability, and lastly, its complete cessation; this condition lasts\r\nseveral hours; at length the animal returns to its normal state. If the\r\ndose is raised to ·1 grm. (1·5 grain) after the cessation of reflex\r\nmovements, the heart is paralysed--and a paralysis not due to any\r\ncentral action of the vagus, but to a direct action on the cardiac\r\nganglia. Rabbits of the ordinary weight of 2 kilos. are fully narcotised\r\nby the subcutaneous injection of 1 grm.; the sleep is very profound, and\r\nlasts several hours; the animal wakes up spontaneously, and is\r\napparently none the worse. If 2 grms. are administered, the narcotic\r\neffects, rapidly developed, are much prolonged. There is a remarkable\r\ndiminution of temperature, and the animal dies, the respiration ceasing\r\nwithout convulsion or other sign. Moderate-sized dogs require 6 grms.\r\nfor a full narcosis, and the symptoms are similar; they also wake after\r\nmany hours, in apparent good health.[183]\r\n\r\n[183] C. Ph. Falck has divided the symptoms into (1) Preliminary\r\nhypnotic; (2) an adynamic state; and (3) a comatose condition.\r\n\r\n§ 199. Liebreich considered that the action of chloral was due to its\r\nbeing broken up by the alkali of the blood, and the system being thus\r\nbrought into a state precisely similar to its condition when\r\nanæsthetised by chloroform vapour. This view has, however, been proved\r\nto be erroneous. Chloral hydrate can, it is true, be decomposed in some\r\ndegree by the blood at 40°; but the action must be prolonged for several\r\nhours. A 1 per cent. solution of alkali does not decompose chloral at a\r\nblood-heat in the time within which chloral acts in the body; and since\r\nnarcotic effects are commonly observed when, in the fatty group,\r\nhydrogen has been displaced by chlorine, it is more probable that\r\nchloral hydrate is absorbed and circulates in the blood as such, and is\r\nnot broken up into chloroform and an alkaline formiate.\r\n\r\n§ 200. =Effects of Chloral Hydrate on Man.=--Since the year 1869, in\r\nwhich chloral was first introduced to medicine, it has been the cause\r\nof a number of accidental and other cases of poisoning. I find, up to\r\nthe year 1884, recorded in medical literature, thirty-one cases of\r\npoisoning by chloral hydrate. This number is a small proportion only of\r\nthe actual number dying from this cause. In nearly all the cases the\r\npoison was taken by the mouth, but in one instance the patient died in\r\nthree hours, after having injected into the rectum 5·86 grms. of chloral\r\nhydrate. There is also on record a case in which, for the purpose of\r\nproducing surgical anæsthesia, 6 grms. of chloral were injected into the\r\nveins; the man died in as many minutes.[184]\r\n\r\n[184] This dangerous practice was introduced by M. Ore. In a case of\r\ntraumatic tetanus, in which M. Ore injected into the veins 9 grms. of\r\nchloral in 10 grms. of water, there was profound insensibility, lasting\r\neleven hours, during which time a painful operation on the thumb was\r\nperformed. The next day 10 grms. were injected, when the insensibility\r\nlasted eight hours; and 9 grms. were injected on each of the two\r\nfollowing days. The man recovered. In another case, Ore anæsthetised\r\nimmediately a patient by plunging the subcutaneous needle of his syringe\r\ninto the radial vein, and injected 10 grms. of chloral hydrate with 30\r\nof water. The patient became insensible before the whole quantity was\r\ninjected with “_une immobilité rappellant celle du cadavre_.” On\r\nfinishing the operation, the patient was roused immediately by the\r\napplication of an electric current, one pole on the left side of the\r\nneck, the other on the epigastrium. _Journ. de Pharm. et de Chimie._, t.\r\n19, p. 314.\r\n\r\n§ 201. =Fatal Dose.=--It is impossible to state with any exactness the\r\nprecise quantity of chloral which may cause death. Children bear it\r\nbetter, in proportion, than adults, while old persons (especially those\r\nwith weak hearts, and those inclined to apoplexy) are likely to be\r\nstrongly affected by very small doses. A dose of ·19 grm. (3 grains) has\r\nbeen fatal to a child a year old in ten hours. On the other hand,\r\naccording to Bouchut’s observations on 10,000 children, he considers\r\nthat the full therapeutic effect of chloral can be obtained safely with\r\nthem in the following ratio:--\r\n\r\n  Children of 1 to 3 years, dose  1 to 1·5 grm. (15·4 to 23·1 grains)\r\n      „       3  „ 5   „     „    2  „ 3    „   (30·8  „ 46·3   „   )\r\n      „       5  „ 7   „     „    3  „ 4    „   (46·3  „ 61·7   „   )\r\n\r\n  These quantities being dissolved in 100 c.c. of water.\r\n\r\nThese doses are certainly too high, and it would be dangerous to take\r\nthem as a guide, since death has occurred in a child, aged 5, from a\r\ndose of 3 grms. (46·3 grains). Medical men in England consider 20 grains\r\na very full dose for a child of four years old, and 50 for an adult,\r\nwhile a case is recorded in which a dose of 1·9 grm. (30 grains) proved\r\nfatal in thirty-five hours to a young lady aged 20. On the other hand,\r\nwe find a case[185] in which, to a patient suffering from epileptic\r\nmania, a dose of 31·1 grms. (1·1 oz.) of chloral hydrate was\r\nadministered; she sank into a deep sleep in five minutes. Subcutaneous\r\ninjections of strychnine were applied, and after sleeping for\r\nforty-eight hours, there was recovery. On the third day a vivid\r\nscarlatinal rash appeared, followed by desquamation. The examples\r\nquoted--the fatal dose of 1·9 grm., and recovery from 31 grms.--are the\r\ntwo extremes for adults. From other cases, it appears tolerably plain\r\nthat most people would recover, especially with appropriate treatment,\r\nfrom a single dose under 8 grms., but anything above that quantity taken\r\nat one time would be very dangerous, and doses of 10 grms. and above,\r\nalmost always fatal. If, however, 8 grms. were taken in divided doses\r\nduring the twenty-four hours, it could (according to Sir B. W.\r\nRichardson) be done with safety. The time from the taking of the poison\r\ntill death varies considerably, and is in part dependent on the dose.\r\n\r\n[185] _Chicago Medical Review_, 1882.\r\n\r\nIn seven cases of lethal poisoning, three persons who took the small\r\ndoses of 1·25, 2·5, and 1·95 grms. respectively, lived from eight to ten\r\nhours; two, taking 4 and 5 grms. respectively, died very shortly after\r\nthe administration of the chloral. In a sixth case, related by Brown, in\r\nwhich 3·12 grms. had been taken, the patient lived an hour; and in\r\nanother, after a dose of 5 grms., recorded by Jolly, death took place\r\nwithin a quarter of an hour.\r\n\r\n§ 202. =Symptoms.=--With moderate doses there are practically no\r\nsymptoms, save a drowsiness coming on imperceptibly, and followed by\r\nheavy sleep. With doses up to 2 grms. (30·8 grains), the hypnotic state\r\nis perfectly under the command of the will, and if the person chooses to\r\nwalk about or engage in any occupation, he can ward off sleep; but with\r\nthose doses which lead to danger, the narcosis is completely\r\nuncontrollable, the appearance of the sleeper is often strikingly like\r\nthat of a drunken person. There is great diminution of temperature\r\ncommencing in from five to twenty minutes after taking the\r\ndose--occasionally sleep is preceded by a delirious state. During the\r\ndeep slumber the face is much flushed, and in a few cases the sleep\r\npasses directly into death without any marked change. In others,\r\nsymptoms of collapse appear, and the patient sinks through exhaustion.\r\n\r\n§ 203. With some persons doses, which, in themselves, are insufficient\r\nto cause death, yet have a peculiar effect on the mental faculties. A\r\ncase of great medico-legal interest is described by the patient himself,\r\nDr. Manjot.[186] He took in three doses, hourly, 12 grms. of chloral\r\nhydrate. After the first dose the pain, for which he had recourse to\r\nchloral, vanished; but Manjot, although he had all the appearance of\r\nbeing perfectly conscious, yet had not the slightest knowledge of what\r\nhe was doing or speaking. He took the other two doses, and sank into a\r\ndeep sleep which lasted twelve hours. He then awoke and answered\r\nquestions with difficulty, but could not move; he lay for the next\r\ntwelve hours in a half slumber, and the following night slept\r\nsoundly--to wake up recovered.\r\n\r\n[186] _Gaz. des Hôp._, 1875.\r\n\r\n§ 204. The treatment of acute chloral poisoning which has been most\r\nsuccessful is that by strychnine injections, and the application of\r\nwarmth to counteract the loss of temperature which is so constant a\r\nphenomenon. As an illustration of the treatment by strychnine, an\r\ninteresting case recorded by Levinstein[187] may be quoted.\r\n\r\n[187] _Vierteljahrsschr. f. ger. Med._, Bd. xx., 1874.\r\n\r\nA man, thirty-five years old, took at one dose, for the purpose of\r\nsuicide, 24 grms. of chloral hydrate. In half an hour afterwards he was\r\nfound in a deep sleep, with flushed face, swollen veins, and a pulse 160\r\nin the minute. After a further half hour, the congestion of the head was\r\nstill more striking; the temperature was 39·5°; the pulse hard and\r\nbounding 92; the breathing laboured, at times intermittent.\r\n\r\nArtificial respiration was at once commenced, but in spite of this, in\r\nabout another half hour, the face became deadly pale, the temperature\r\nsank to 32·9°. The pupils contracted, and the pulse was scarcely to be\r\nfelt; 3 mgrms. (·04 grain) of strychnine were now injected\r\nsubcutaneously; this caused tetanic convulsions in the upper part of the\r\nbody and trismus. The heart’s action again became somewhat stronger, the\r\ntemperature rose to 33·3°, and the pupils dilated; but soon followed,\r\nagain, depression of the heart’s action, and the respiration could only\r\nbe kept going by faradisation. Two mgrms. (·03 grain) of strychnine were\r\nonce more injected, and the heart’s action improved. During the\r\nsucceeding six hours the respiration had to be assisted by faradisation.\r\nThe temperature gradually rose to 36·5°; ten hours after taking the dose\r\nthe patient lay in a deep sleep, breathing spontaneously and reacting to\r\nexternal stimuli with a temperature of 38·5°. Eighteen hours from the\r\ncommencement, the respiration again became irregular, and the galvanic\r\ncurrent was anew applied. The last application aroused the sleeper, he\r\ntook some milk and again slept; after twenty-seven hours he could be\r\nawakened by calling, &c., but had not full consciousness; he again took\r\nsome milk and sank to sleep. It was not until thirty-two hours had\r\nelapsed from the ingestion of the poison that he awoke spontaneously;\r\nthere were no after effects.\r\n\r\n§ 205. =Chronic Poisoning by Chloral Hydrate.=--An enormous number of\r\npeople habitually take chloral hydrate. The history of the habit is\r\nusually that some physician has given them a chloral prescription for\r\nneuralgia, for loss of sleep, or other cause, and finding that they can\r\nconjure sleep, oblivion, and loss (it may be) of suffering whenever they\r\nchoose, they go on repeating it from day to day until it becomes a\r\nnecessity of their existence. A dangerous facility to chloral-drinking\r\nis the existence of patent medicines, advertised as sleep-producers, and\r\ncontaining chloral as the active ingredient. A lady, aged 35, died in\r\n1876, at Exeter, from an overdose of “Hunter’s solution of chloral, or\r\nsedative draught and sleep producer.” Its strength was stated at the\r\ninquest to be 25 grains to the drachm (41·6 per cent.).[188]\r\n\r\n[188] _Exeter and Plymouth Gazette_, Jan. 12, 1876.\r\n\r\nThe evil results of this chloral-drinking are especially to be looked\r\nfor in the mental faculties, and the alienists have had since 1869 a new\r\ninsanity-producing factor. In the asylums may usually be found several\r\ncases of melancholia and mania referred rightly (or wrongly) to\r\nchloral-drinking. Symptoms other than cerebral are chilliness of the\r\nbody, inclination to fainting, clonic convulsions, and a want of\r\nco-ordination of the muscles of the lower extremities. In a case\r\nrecorded by Husband,[189] a lady, after twelve days’ treatment by\r\nchloral hydrate, in doses of from 1 to 2 grms. (15·4 to 30·8 grains),\r\nsuffered from a scarlatina-like rash, which was followed by\r\ndesquamation. Among the insane, it has also been noticed that its use\r\nhas been followed by nettle-rash and petechiæ (Reimer and others).\r\n\r\n[189] _Lancet_, 1871.\r\n\r\n§ 206. =Excretion of Chloral.=--Chloral hydrate is separated in the\r\nurine partly as urochloral acid (C₈H₁₁Cl₃O₇). Butylchloral is separated\r\nas butyl urochloral acid (C₁₀H₁₅Cl₂O₇). Urochloral acid is crystalline,\r\nsoluble in water, in alcohol, and in ether, reduces copper from\r\nFehling’s solution, and rotates a ray of polarised light to the left.\r\nUrochloral acid, on boiling with either dilute sulphuric or hydrochloric\r\nacid, splits up into trichlorethyl alcohol and glycuronic acid--\r\n\r\n  C₈H₁₁Cl₃O₇ + H₂O = C₂H₃Cl₃O + C₆H₁₀O₇.\r\n\r\nTrichloralcohol is an oily fluid (boiling-point 150°-152°); it yields by\r\noxidation trichloracetic acid.\r\n\r\nUrobutyl chloral acid gives on treatment with mineral acids\r\ntrichlorbutyl alcohol and glycuronic acid.\r\n\r\nTo separate urochloral acid from the urine the following process has\r\nbeen found successful:--\r\n\r\nThe urine is evaporated to a syrup at the heat of the water-bath, and\r\nthen strongly acidulated with sulphuric acid and repeatedly shaken out\r\nin a separating tube with a mixture of 3 vols. of ether and 1 vol. of\r\nalcohol. The ether-alcohol is separated and distilled off, the acid\r\nresidue is neutralised with KHO, or potassic carbonate, and evaporated;\r\nthe dry mass is then taken up with 90 per cent. alcohol, the filtrate\r\nprecipitated with ether, and the precipitate washed with ether and\r\nabsolute alcohol.\r\n\r\nNext the precipitate is boiled with absolute alcohol and filtered hot.\r\nOn cooling, the potassium salt of urochloral acid separates out in tufts\r\nof silky needles. The crystals are dried over sulphuric acid and again\r\nwashed several times with absolute alcohol and ether to remove\r\nimpurities.\r\n\r\nTo obtain the free acid, the potassium salt is dissolved in a little\r\nwater and acidulated with hydrochloric acid; the liquid is then shaken\r\nout in a separating tube, with a mixture of 8 vols. of ether and 1 of\r\nalcohol. The ether-alcohol is distilled off, the residue treated with\r\nmoist silver oxide until no farther separation of silver chloride\r\noccurs, the silver chloride is separated by filtration, the soluble\r\nsilver salt decomposed by SH₂, and the filtrate carefully evaporated to\r\na syrup; after a few hours, the acid crystallises in stars of needles.\r\n\r\nUrobutylchloral acid can be obtained in quite a similar way.[190]\r\n\r\n[190] V. Mering u. Musculus, _Ber._, viii. 662; v. Mering, _ibid._, xv.\r\n1019; E. Kulz, _Ber._, xv., 1538.\r\n\r\n§ 207. =Separation of Chloral from Organic Matters.=--It will be most\r\nconvenient to place the organic fluid or pulped-up solid, mixed with\r\nwater, in a retort, to acidify with tartaric acid, and to distil.\r\n\r\nChloral hydrate distils over from a liquid acidified with tartaric acid;\r\nto obtain the whole of the chloral requires distillation in a vacuum\r\nalmost to dryness.\r\n\r\nThe distillation will, unless there is also some partly decomposed\r\nchloral, not smell of chloroform, and yet give chloroform reactions.\r\n\r\nTo identify it, to the distillate should be added a little burnt\r\nmagnesia, and the distillate thus treated boiled for half an hour in a\r\nflask connected with an inverted condenser; in this way the chloral\r\nhydrate is changed into chloroform and magnesium formate--\r\n\r\n  2CCl₃CH(OH)₂ + MgO = 2CHCl₃ + (HCOO)₂Mg + H₂O.\r\n\r\nThe fluid may now be tested for formic acid: it will give a black\r\nprecipitate with solution of silver nitrate--\r\n\r\n  (HCOO)₂Mg + 4AgNO₃ = 4Ag + Mg(NO₃)₂ + 2CO₂ + 2HNO₃.\r\n\r\nIt will give a white precipitate of calomel when treated with mercuric\r\nchloride solution--\r\n\r\n  (HCOO)₂Mg + 4HgCl₂ = 2Hg₂Cl₂ + MgCl₂ + 2HCl + 2CO₂.\r\n\r\nChloral (or chloroform), when boiled with resorcinol and the liquid made\r\nstrongly alkaline with NaHO, gives a red colour, which disappears on\r\nacidifying and is restored by alkalies. If, on the other hand, there is\r\nan excess of resorcinol and only a very small quantity of NaHO used, the\r\nproduct shows a yellowish-green fluorescence; 1/10 of a milligramme of\r\nchloral hydrate gives this reaction distinctly when boiled with 50\r\nmgrms. of resorcinol and 5 drops of a normal solution of sodium\r\nhydrate.[191]\r\n\r\n[191] C. Schwarz, _Pharm. Zeit._, xxxiii. 419.\r\n\r\nDr. Frank Ogston[192] has recommended sulphide of ammonium to be added\r\nto any liquid as a test for chloral. The contents of the stomach are\r\nfiltered or submitted to dialysis, and the test applied direct. If\r\nchloral is present, there is first an orange-yellow colour; on standing,\r\nthe fluid becomes more and more brown, then troubled, an amorphous\r\nprecipitate falls to the bottom, and a peculiar odour is developed. With\r\n10 mgrms. of chloral in 1 c.c. of water, there is an evident\r\nprecipitate, and the odour can readily be perceived; with 1 mgrm.\r\ndissolved in 1 c.c. of water, there is an orange-yellow colour, and also\r\nthe odour, but no precipitate; with ·1 mgrm. in 1 c.c. of water, there\r\nis a weak, pale, straw-yellow colour, which can scarcely be called\r\ncharacteristic. The only substance giving in neutral solutions the same\r\nreactions is antimony; but, on the addition of a few drops of acid, the\r\nantimony falls as an orange-yellow precipitate, while, if chloral alone\r\nis present, there is a light white precipitate of sulphur.\r\n\r\n[192] _Vierteljahrsschrift f. gerichtl. Medicin_, 1879, Bd. xxx. Hft. 1,\r\nS. 268.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.--Bisulphide of Carbon.\r\n\r\n§ 208. Bisulphide of carbon--_carbon disulphide_, _carbon sulphide_\r\n(CS₂)--is a colourless, volatile fluid, strongly refracting light.\r\nCommercial samples have a most repulsive and penetrating odour, but\r\nchemically pure carbon sulphide has a smell which is not disagreeable.\r\nThe boiling-point is 47°; the specific gravity at 0° is 1·293. It is\r\nvery inflammable, burning with a blue flame, and evolving sulphur\r\ndioxide; is little soluble in water, but mixes easily with alcohol or\r\nether. Bisulphide of carbon, on account of its solvent powers for\r\nsulphur, phosphorus, oils, resins, caoutchouc, gutta-percha, &c., is in\r\ngreat request in certain industries. It is also utilised for\r\ndisinfecting purposes, the liquid being burnt in a lamp.\r\n\r\n§ 209. =Poisoning by Carbon Bisulphide.=--In spite of the cheapness and\r\nnumerous applications of this liquid, poisoning is very rare. There\r\nappears to be a case on record of attempted self-destruction by this\r\nagent, in which a man took 2 ozs. (56·7 c.c.) of the liquid, but without\r\na fatal result. The symptoms in this case were pallor of the face, wide\r\npupils, frequent and weak pulse, lessened bodily temperature, and\r\nspasmodic convulsions. Carbon disulphide was detected in the breath by\r\nleading the expired air through an alcoholic solution of\r\ntriethyl-phosphin, with which it struck a red colour. It could also be\r\nfound in the urine in the same way. An intense burning in the throat,\r\ngiddiness, and headache lasted for several days.\r\n\r\n§ 210. Experiments on animals have been frequent, and it is found to be\r\nfatal to all forms of animal life. There is, indeed, no more convenient\r\nagent for the destruction of various noxious insects, such as moths, the\r\nweevils in biscuits, the common bug, &c., than bisulphide of carbon. It\r\nhas also been recommended for use in exterminating mice and rats.[193]\r\nDifferent animals show various degrees of sensitiveness to the vapour;\r\nfrogs and cats being less affected by it than birds, rabbits, and\r\nguinea-pigs. It is a blood poison; methæmoglobin is formed, and there is\r\ndisintegration of the red blood corpuscles. There is complete anæsthesia\r\nof the whole body, and death occurs through paralysis of the respiratory\r\ncentre, but artificial respiration fails to restore life.\r\n\r\n[193] Cloëz, _Compt. Rend._, t. 63, 85.\r\n\r\n§ 211. =Chronic Poisoning.=--Of some importance is the chronic poisoning\r\nby carbon disulphide, occasionally met with in manufactures\r\nnecessitating the daily use of large quantities for dissolving\r\ncaoutchouc, &c. When taken thus in the form of vapour daily for some\r\ntime, it gives rise to a complex series of symptoms which may be divided\r\ninto two principal stages--viz., a stage of excitement and one of\r\ndepression. In the first phase, there is more or less permanent\r\nheadache, with considerable indigestion, and its attendant loss of\r\nappetite, nausea, &c. The sensitiveness of the skin is also heightened,\r\nand there are curious sensations of creeping, &c. The mind at the same\r\ntime in some degree suffers, the temper becomes irritable, and singing\r\nin the ears and noises in the head have been noticed. In one factory a\r\nworkman suffered from an acute mania, which subsided in two days upon\r\nremoving him from the noxious vapour (_Eulenberg_). The sleep is\r\ndisturbed by dreams, and, according to Delpech,[194] there is\r\nconsiderable sexual excitement, but this statement has in no way been\r\nconfirmed. Pains in the limbs are a constant phenomenon, and the French\r\nobservers have noticed spasmodic contractions of certain groups of\r\nmuscles.\r\n\r\n[194] _Mémoire sur les Accidents que développe chez les ouvrières en\r\ncaoutchouc du sulfure de carb. en vapeur_, Paris, 1856.\r\n\r\nThe stage of depression begins with a more or less pronounced anæsthesia\r\nof the skin. This is not confined to the outer skin, but also affects\r\nthe mucous membranes; patients complain that they feel as if the tongue\r\nwere covered with a cloth. The anæsthesia is very general. In a case\r\nrecorded by Bernhardt,[195] a girl, twenty-two years old, who had worked\r\nsix weeks in a caoutchouc factory, suffered from mental weakness and\r\ndigestive troubles; there was anæsthesia and algesis of the whole skin.\r\nIn these advanced cases the mental debility is very pronounced, and\r\nthere is also weakness of the muscular system. Paralysis of the lower\r\nlimbs has been noted, and in one instance a man had his right hand\r\nparalysed for two months. It seems uncertain how long a person is likely\r\nto suffer from the effects of the vapour after he is removed from its\r\ninfluence. If the first stage of poisoning only is experienced, then\r\nrecovery is generally rapid; but if mental and muscular weakness and\r\nanæsthesia of the skin have been developed, a year has been known to\r\nelapse without any considerable improvement, and permanent injury to the\r\nhealth may be feared.\r\n\r\n[195] _Ber. klin. Wochenschrift_, No. 32, 1866.\r\n\r\n§ 212. =Post-mortem Appearances.=--The pathological appearances found\r\nafter sudden death from disulphide of carbon are but little different to\r\nthose found after fatal chloroform breathing.\r\n\r\n§ 213. =Detection and Separation of Carbon Disulphide.=--The extreme\r\nvolatility of the liquid renders it easy to separate it from organic\r\nliquids by distillation with reduced pressure in a stream of CO₂. Carbon\r\ndisulphide is best identified by (1) Hofman’s test, viz., passing the\r\nvapour into an ethereal solution of triethyl-phosphin, (C₂H₅)₃P. Carbon\r\ndisulphide forms with triethyl-phosphin a compound which crystallises in\r\nred scales. The crystals melt at 95° C., and have the following\r\nformula--P(C₂H₅)₃CS₂. This will detect 0·54 mgrm. Should the quantity of\r\nbisulphide be small, no crystals may be obtained, but the liquid will\r\nbecome of a red colour. (2) CS₂ gives, with an alcoholic solution of\r\npotash, a precipitate of potassic xanthate, CS₂C₂H₅OK.\r\n\r\n    § 214. =Xanthogenic acid or ethyloxide-sulphocarbonate= (CS₂C₂H₅OH)\r\n    is prepared by decomposing potassic xanthogenate by diluted\r\n    hydrochloric or sulphuric acid. It is a colourless fluid, having an\r\n    unpleasant odour, and a weakly acid and rather bitter taste. It\r\n    burns with a blue colour, and is easily decomposed at 24°, splitting\r\n    up into ethylic alcohol and hydric sulphide. It is very poisonous,\r\n    and has an anæsthetic action similar to bisulphide of carbon. Its\r\n    properties are probably due to CS₂ being liberated within the body.\r\n\r\n    § 215. =Potassic xanthogenate= (CS₂C₂H₅OK) and =potassic\r\n    xanthamylate= (CS₂C₅H₁₁OK) (the latter being prepared by the\r\n    substitution of amyl alcohol for ethyl alcohol), both on the\r\n    application of a heat below that of the body, develop CS₂, and are\r\n    poisonous, inducing symptoms very similar to those already detailed.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.--The Tar Acids--Phenol--Cresol.\r\n\r\n§ 216. =Carbolic Acid. Syn. Phenol, Phenyl Alcohol, Phenylic Hydrate;\r\nPhenic Acid; Coal-Tar Creasote.=--The formula for carbolic acid is\r\nC₆H₅HO. The pure substance appears at the ordinary temperature as a\r\ncolourless solid, crystallising in long prisms; the fusibility of the\r\ncrystals is given variously by different authors: from my own\r\nobservation, the pure crystals melt at 40°-41°, any lower melting-point\r\nbeing due to the presence of cresylic acid or other impurity; the\r\ncrystals again become solid about 15°. Melted carbolic acid forms a\r\ncolourless limpid fluid, sinking in water. It boils under the ordinary\r\npressure at 182°, and distils without decomposition; it is very readily\r\nand completely distilled in a vacuum at about the temperature of 100°.\r\nAfter the crystals have been exposed to the air, they absorb water, and\r\na hydrate is formed containing 16·07 per cent. of water. The hydrate\r\nmelts at 17°, any greater hydration prevents the crystallisation of the\r\nacid; a carbolic acid, containing about 27 per cent. of water, and\r\nprobably corresponding to the formula C₆H₆O,2H₂O, is obtained by\r\ngradually adding water to carbolic acid so long as it continues to be\r\ndissolved. Such a hydrate dissolves in 11·1 times its measure of water,\r\nand contains 8·56 per cent. of real carbolic acid. Carbolic acid does\r\nnot redden litmus, but produces a greasy stain on paper, disappearing on\r\nexposure to the air; it has a peculiar smell, a burning numbing taste,\r\nand in the fluid state it strongly refracts light. Heated to a high\r\ntemperature it takes fire, and burns with a sooty flame.\r\n\r\nWhen an aqueous solution of carbolic acid is shaken up with ether,\r\nbenzene, carbon disulphide, or chloroform, it is fully dissolved by the\r\nsolvent, and is thus easily separated from most solutions in which it\r\nexists in the free state. Petroleum ether, on the other hand, only\r\nslightly dissolves it in the cold, more on warming. Carbolic acid mixes\r\nin all proportions with glycerin, glacial or acetic acid, and alcohol.\r\nIt coagulates albumen, the precipitate being soluble in an excess of\r\nalbumen; it also dissolves iodine, without changing its properties. It\r\ndissolves many resins, and also sulphur, but, on boiling, sulphuretted\r\nhydrogen is disengaged. Indigo blue is soluble in hot carbolic acid, and\r\nmay be obtained in crystals on cooling. Carbolic acid is contained in\r\ncastoreum, a secretion derived from the beaver, but it has not yet been\r\ndetected in the vegetable kingdom. The source of carbolic acid is at\r\npresent coal-tar, from which it is obtained by a process of\r\ndistillation. There are, however, a variety of chemical actions in the\r\ncourse of which carbolic acid is formed.\r\n\r\n§ 217. The common disinfecting carbolic acid is a dark reddish liquid,\r\nwith a very strong odour; at present there is very little phenol in it;\r\nit is mainly composed of meta- and para-cresol. It is officinal in\r\nGermany, and there must contain at least 50 per cent. of the pure\r\ncarbolic acid. The pure crystallised carbolic acid is officinal in our\r\nown and all the continental pharmacopœias. In the British Pharmacopœia,\r\na solution of carbolic acid in glycerin is officinal; the proportions\r\nare 1 part of carbolic acid and 4 parts of glycerin, that is, strength\r\nby measure = 20 per cent. The Pharmacopœia Germanica has a _liquor natri\r\ncarbolici_, made with 5 parts carbolic acid, 1 caustic soda, and 4 of\r\nwater; strength in carbolic acid = 50 per cent. There is also a strongly\r\nalkaline crude sodic carbolate in use as a preservative of wood.\r\n\r\nThere are various disinfecting fluids containing amounts of carbolic\r\nacid, from 10 per cent. upwards. Many of these are somewhat complex\r\nmixtures, but, as a rule, any poisonous properties they possess are\r\nmainly due to their content of phenol or cresol. A great variety of\r\ndisinfecting powders, under various names, are also in commerce,\r\nderiving their activity from carbolic acid. Macdougall’s disinfecting\r\npowder is made by adding a certain proportion of impure carbolic acid to\r\na calcic sulphite, which is prepared by passing sulphur dioxide over\r\nignited limestone.\r\n\r\n=Calvert’s carbolic acid powder= is made by adding carbolic acid to the\r\nsiliceous residue obtained from the manufacture of aluminic sulphate\r\nfrom shale. There are also various carbolates which, by heating or\r\ndecomposing with sulphuric acid, give off carbolic acid.\r\n\r\n=Carbolic acid soaps= are also made on a large scale--the acid is free,\r\nand some of the soaps contain as much as 10 per cent. In the inferior\r\ncarbolic acid soaps there is little or no carbolic acid, but cresylic\r\ntakes its place. Neither the soaps nor the powders have hitherto\r\nattained any toxicological importance, but the alkaline carbolates are\r\nvery poisonous.\r\n\r\n§ 218. =The chief uses= of carbolic acid are indicated by the foregoing\r\nenumeration of the principal preparations used in medicine and commerce.\r\nThe bulk of the carbolic acid manufactured is for the purposes of\r\ndisinfection. It is also utilised in the preparation of certain\r\ncolouring matters or dyes, and during the last few years has had another\r\napplication in the manufacture of salicylic acid. In medicine it is\r\nadministered occasionally internally, while the antiseptic movement in\r\nsurgery, initiated by Lister, has given it great prominence in surgical\r\noperations.\r\n\r\n§ 219. =Statistics.=--The tar acids, _i.e._, pure carbolic acid and the\r\nimpure acids sold under the name of carbolic acid, but consisting (as\r\nstated before) mainly of cresol, are, of all powerful poisons, the most\r\naccessible, and the most recklessly distributed. We find them at the\r\nbedside of the sick, in back-kitchens, in stables, in public and private\r\nclosets and urinals, and, indeed, in almost all places where there are\r\nlikely to be foul odours or decomposing matters. It is, therefore, no\r\nwonder that poisoning by carbolic acid has, of late years, assumed large\r\nproportions. The acid has become vulgarised, and quite as popularly\r\nknown, as the most common household drugs or chemicals.[196] This\r\nfamiliarity is the growth of a very few years, since it was not\r\ndiscovered until 1834, and does not seem to have been used by Lister\r\nuntil about 1863. It was not known to the people generally until much\r\nlater. At present it occupies the third place in fatality of all\r\npoisons in England. The following table shows that, in the past ten\r\nyears, carbolic acid has killed 741 people, either accidentally or\r\nsuicidally; there is also one case of murder by carbolic acid within the\r\nsame period, bringing the total up to 742:--\r\n\r\n[196] Although this is so, yet much ignorance still prevails as to its\r\nreal nature. In a case reported in the _Pharm. Journ._, 1881, p. 334, a\r\nwoman, thirty years of age, drank two-thirds of an ounce of liquid\r\nlabelled “_Pure Carbolic Acid_” by mistake, and died in two hours. She\r\nread the label, and a lodger also read it, but did not know what it\r\nmeant.\r\n\r\nDEATHS FROM CARBOLIC ACID IN ENGLAND AND WALES DURING THE TEN YEARS\r\nENDING 1892.\r\n\r\n                       ACCIDENT OR NEGLIGENCE.\r\n\r\n  Ages,       0-1  1-5  5-15  15-25  25-65  65 and  Total\r\n                                            above\r\n  Males,       2   39    13      5     83      8     150\r\n  Females,     2   21     7     13     51      7     101\r\n              -------------------------------------------\r\n  Totals,      4   60    20     18    134     15     251\r\n              -------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                               SUICIDE.\r\n\r\n  Ages,                       15-25  25-65  65 and  Total\r\n                                            above\r\n  Males,                        26    186      7     219\r\n  Females,                      72    194      5     271\r\n                             ----------------------------\r\n  Totals,                       98    380     12     490\r\n                             ----------------------------\r\n\r\nFalck has collected, since the year 1868, no less than 87 cases of\r\npoisoning from carbolic acid recorded in medical literature. In one of\r\nthe cases the individual died in nine hours from a large dose of\r\ncarbolate of soda; in a second, violent symptoms were induced by\r\nbreathing for three hours carbolic acid vapour; in the remaining 85, the\r\npoisoning was caused by the liquid acid. Of these 85 persons, 7 had\r\ntaken the poison with suicidal intent, and of the 7, 5 died; 39 were\r\npoisoned through the medicinal use of carbolic acid, 27 of the 39 by the\r\nantiseptic treatment of wounds by carbolic acid dressings, and of these\r\n8 terminated fatally; in 8 cases, symptoms of poisoning followed the\r\nrubbing or painting of the acid on the skin for the cure of scabies,\r\nfavus, or psoriasis, and 6 of these patients died. In 4 cases, carbolic\r\nacid enemata, administered for the purpose of dislodging ascarides, gave\r\nrise to symptoms of poisoning, and in one instance death followed.\r\n\r\nThe substitution of carbolic acid for medicine happened as follows:--\r\n\r\n                                                 Cases.\r\n  Taken instead of Tincture of Opium,              1\r\n    „      „       Infusion of Senna,              3\r\n    „      „       Mineral Water,                  2\r\n    „      „       other Mixtures,                 3\r\n    „   inwardly instead of applied outwardly,     3\r\n                                                  --\r\n                                                  12\r\n\r\nOf these 12, 8 died.\r\n\r\nAgain, 10 persons took carbolic acid in mistake for various alcoholic\r\ndrinks, such as schnapps, brandy, rum, or beer, and 9 of the 10\r\nsuccumbed; 17 persons drank carbolic acid simply “by mistake,” and of\r\nthese 13 died. Thus, of the whole 85 cases, no less than 51 ended\r\nfatally--nearly 60 per cent.\r\n\r\nIt must be always borne in mind that, with regard to statistics\r\ngenerally, the term “carbolic acid” is not used by coroners, juries, or\r\nmedical men, in a strictly chemical sense, the term being made to\r\ninclude disinfecting fluids which are almost wholly composed of the\r\ncresols, and contain scarcely any phenol. In this article, with regard\r\nto symptoms and pathological appearances, it is only occasionally\r\npossible to state whether the pure medicinal crystalline phenol or a\r\nmixture of tar-acids was the cause of poisoning.\r\n\r\n§ 220. =Fatal Dose.=--The minimum fatal dose for cats, dogs, and\r\nrabbits, appears to be from ·4 to ·5 grm. per kilogram. Falck has put\r\nthe minimum lethal dose for man at 15 grms. (231·5 grains), which would\r\nbe about ·2 per kilo., basing his estimate on the following reasoning.\r\nIn 33 cases he had a fairly exact record of the amount of acid taken,\r\nand out of the 33, he selects only those cases which are of use for the\r\ndecision of the question. Among adults, in 5 cases the dose was 30\r\ngrms., and all the 5 cases terminated by death, in times varying from\r\nfive minutes to an hour and a half. By other 5 adults a dose of 15 grms.\r\nwas taken; of the 5, 3 men and a woman died, in times varying from\r\nforty-five minutes to thirty hours, while 1 woman recovered. Doses of\r\n11·5, 10·8, and 9 grms. were taken by different men, and recovered from;\r\non the other hand, a suicide who took one and a half teaspoonful (about\r\n6 grms.) of the concentrated acid, died in fifty minutes. Doses of ·3 to\r\n3 grms. have caused symptoms of poisoning, but the patients recovered,\r\nwhile higher doses than 15 grms. in 12 cases, with only one exception,\r\ncaused death. Hence, it may be considered tolerably well established,\r\nthat 15 grms. (231·5 grains) may be taken as representing the minimum\r\nlethal dose.\r\n\r\nThe largest dose from which a person appears to have recovered is, I\r\nbelieve, that given in a case recorded by Davidson, in which 150 grms.\r\nof crude carbolic acid had been taken. It must, however, be remembered\r\nthat, as this was the impure acid, probably only half of it was really\r\ncarbolic acid. The German Pharmacopœia prescribes as a maximum dose ·05\r\ngrm (·7 grain) of the crystallised acid, and a daily maximum quantity\r\ngiven in divided doses of ·15 grm. (2·3 grains).\r\n\r\n§ 221. =Effects on Animals.=--Carbolic acid is poisonous to both animal\r\nand vegetable life.\r\n\r\n=Infusoria.=--One part of the acid in 10,000 parts of water rapidly\r\nkills ciliated animalcules,--the movements become sluggish, the sarcode\r\nsubstance darker, and the cilia in a little time cease moving.\r\n\r\n=Fish.=--One part of the acid in 7000 of water kills dace, minnows,\r\nroach, and gold fish. In this amount of dilution the effect is not\r\napparent immediately; but, at the end of a few hours, the movements of\r\nthe fish become sluggish, they frequently rise to the surface to\r\nbreathe, and at the end of twenty-four hours are found dead. Quantities\r\nof carbolic acid, such as 1 part in 100,000 of water, appear to affect\r\nthe health of fish, and render them more liable to be attacked by the\r\nfungus growth which is so destructive to fish-life in certain years.\r\n\r\n=Frogs.=--If ·01 to ·02 grm. of carbolic acid be dissolved in a litre of\r\nwater in which a frog is placed, there is almost immediately signs of\r\nuneasiness in the animal, showing that pain from local contact is\r\nexperienced; a sleepy condition follows, with exaltation of reflex\r\nsensibility; convulsions succeed, generally, though not always; then\r\nreflex sensibility is diminished, ultimately vanishes, and death occurs;\r\nthe muscles and nerves still respond to the electric current, and the\r\nheart beats, but slowly and weakly, for a little after the respiration\r\nhas ceased.\r\n\r\n§ 222. =Warm-blooded Animals.=--For a rabbit of the average weight of 2\r\nkilos., ·15 grm. is an active dose, and ·3 a lethal dose (that is ·15\r\nper kilo.). The sleepy condition of the frog is not noticed, and the\r\nchief symptoms are clonic convulsions with dilatation of the pupils, the\r\nconvulsions passing into death, without a noticeable paralytic stage.\r\nThe symptoms observed in poisoned dogs are almost precisely similar, the\r\ndose, according to body-weight, being the same. It has, however, been\r\nnoticed that with doses large enough to produce convulsions, a weak\r\ncondition has supervened, causing death in several days. There appears\r\nto be no cumulative action, since equal toxic doses can be given to\r\nanimals for some time, and the last dose has no greater effect than the\r\nfirst or intermediate ones. The pathological appearances met with in\r\nanimals poisoned by the minimum lethal doses referred to are not\r\ncharacteristic; but there is a remarkable retardation of putrefaction.\r\n\r\n§ 223. =Symptoms in Man, external application.=--A 5 per cent. solution\r\nof carbolic acid, applied to the skin, causes a peculiar numbness,\r\nfollowed, it may be, by irritation. Young subjects, and those with\r\nsensitive skins, sometimes exhibit a pustular eruption, and concentrated\r\nsolutions cause more or less destruction of the skin. Lemaire[197]\r\ndescribes the action of carbolic acid on the skin as causing a slight\r\ninflammation, with desquamation of the epithelium, followed by a very\r\npermanent brown stain, but this he alone has observed. Applied to the\r\nmucous membrane, carbolic acid turns the epithelial covering white; the\r\nepithelium, however, is soon thrown off, and the place rapidly heals;\r\nthere is the same numbing, aconite-like feeling before noticed. The\r\nvapour of carbolic acid causes redness of the conjunctivæ, and\r\nirritation of the air-passages. If the application is continued, the\r\nmucous membrane swells, whitens, and pours out an abundant secretion.\r\n\r\n[197] Lemaire, Jul., “_De l’Acide phénique_,” Paris, 1864.\r\n\r\nDr. Whitelock, of Greenock, has related two instances in which children\r\nwere treated with carbolic acid lotion (strength 2½ per cent.) as an\r\napplication to the scalp for ringworm; in both, symptoms of poisoning\r\noccurred--in the one, the symptoms at once appeared; in the other they\r\nwere delayed some days. In order to satisfy his mind, the experiment was\r\nrepeated twice, and each time gastric and urinary troubles followed.\r\n\r\nNussbaum, of Munich, records a case[198] in which symptoms were induced\r\nby the forcible injection of a solution of carbolic acid into the cavity\r\nof an abscess.\r\n\r\n[198] _Leitfaden zur antiseptischer Wundbehandlung_, 141.\r\n\r\nMacphail[199] gives two cases of poisoning by carbolic acid from\r\nexternal use. In the one, a large tumour had been removed from a woman\r\naged 30, and the wound covered with gauze steeped in a solution of\r\ncarbolic acid, in glycerin, strength 10 per cent.; subsequently, there\r\nwas high fever, with diminished sulphates in the urine, which smelt\r\nstrongly of carbolic acid, and was very dark. On substituting boracic\r\nacid, none of these troubles were observed. The second case was that of\r\na servant suffering from axillary abscess; the wound was syringed out\r\nwith carbolic acid solution, of strength 2½ per cent., when effects were\r\nproduced similar to those in the first case. It was noted that in both\r\nthese cases the pulse was slowed. Scattered throughout surgical and\r\nmedical literature, there are many other cases recorded, though not all\r\nso clear as those cited. Several cases are also on record in which\r\npoisonous symptoms (and even death) have resulted from the application\r\nof carbolic acid lotion as a remedy for scabies or itch.\r\n\r\n[199] “Carbolic Acid Poisoning (Surgical),” by S. Rutherford Macphail,\r\nM.B., _Ed. Med. Journal_, cccxiv., Aug. 1881, p. 134.\r\n\r\nA surgeon prescribed for two joiners who suffered from scabies a lotion,\r\nwhich was intended to contain 30 grms. of carbolic acid in 240 c.c. of\r\nwater; but the actual contents of the flasks were afterwards from\r\nanalysis estimated by Hoppe-Seyler to be 33·26 grms., and the quantity\r\nused by each to be equal to 13·37 grms. (206 grains) of carbolic acid.\r\nOne of the men died; the survivor described his own symptoms as\r\nfollows:--He and his companion stood in front of the fire, and rubbed\r\nthe lotion in; he rubbed it into his legs, breast, and the front part of\r\nhis body; the other parts were mutually rubbed. Whilst rubbing his right\r\narm, and drying it before the fire, he felt a burning sensation, a\r\ntightness and giddiness, and mentioned his sensations to his companion,\r\nwho laughed. This condition lasted from five to seven minutes, but he\r\ndid not remember whether his companion complained of anything, nor did\r\nhe know what became of him, nor how he himself came to be in bed. He was\r\nfound holding on to the joiner’s bench, looking with wide staring eyes,\r\nlike a drunken man, and was delirious for half an hour. The following\r\nnight he slept uneasily and complained of headache and burning of the\r\nskin. The pulse was 68, the appearance of the urine, appetite, and sense\r\nof taste were normal; the bowels confined. He soon recovered.\r\n\r\nThe other joiner seems to have died as suddenly as if he had taken\r\nprussic acid. He called to his mother, “_Ich habe einen Rausch_,” and\r\ndied with pale livid face, after taking two deep, short inspirations.\r\n\r\nThe _post-mortem_ examination showed the sinuses filled with much fluid\r\nblood, and the vessels of the pia mater congested. Frothy, dark, fluid\r\nblood was found in the lungs, which were hyperæmic; the mucous tissues\r\nof the epiglottis and air-tubes were reddened, and covered with a frothy\r\nslime. Both ventricles--the venæ cavæ and the vessels of the spleen and\r\nkidneys--were filled with dark fluid blood. The muscles were very red;\r\nthere was no special odour. Hoppe-Seyler recognised carbolic acid in the\r\nblood and different organs of the body.[200]\r\n\r\n[200] R. Köhler, _Würtem. Med. Corr. Bl._, xlii., No. 6, April 1872; H.\r\nAbelin, _Schmidt’s Jahrbücher_, 1877, Bd. 173, S. 163.\r\n\r\nIn another case, a child died from the outward use of a 2 per cent.\r\nsolution of carbolic acid. It is described as follows:--An infant of\r\nseven weeks old suffered from varicella, and one of the pustules became\r\nthe centre of an erysipelatous inflammation. To this place a 2 per cent.\r\nsolution of carbolic acid was applied by means of a compress steeped in\r\nthe acid; the following morning the temperature rose from 36·5° (97·7°\r\nF.) to 37° (98·6° F.), and poisonous symptoms appeared. The urine was\r\ncoloured dark. There were sweats, vomitings, and contracted pupils,\r\nspasmodic twitchings of the eyelids and eyes, with strabismus, slow\r\nrespiration, and, lastly, inability to swallow. Under the influence of\r\nstimulating remedies the condition temporarily improved, but the child\r\ndied twenty-three and a half hours after the first application. An\r\nexamination showed that the vessels of the brain and the tissue of the\r\nlungs were abnormally full of blood. The liver was softer than natural,\r\nand exhibited a notable yellowishness in the centre of the acini.\r\nSomewhat similar appearances were noticed in the kidneys, the\r\nmicroscopic examination of which showed the _tubuli contorti_ enlarged\r\nand filled with fatty globules. In several places the epithelium was\r\ndenuded, in other places swollen, and with the nuclei very visible.\r\n\r\nIn an American case,[201] death followed the application of carbolic\r\nacid to a wound. A boy had been bitten by a dog, and to the wound, at\r\none o’clock in the afternoon, a lotion, consisting of nine parts of\r\ncarbolic acid and one of glycerin, was applied. At seven o’clock in the\r\nevening the child was unconscious, and died at one o’clock the following\r\nday.\r\n\r\n[201] _American Journal of Pharmacy_, vol. li., 4th Ser.; vol. ix.,\r\n1879, p. 57.\r\n\r\n§ 224. =Internal Administration.=--Carbolic acid may be taken into the\r\nsystem, not alone by the mouth, but by the lungs, as in breathing\r\ncarbolic acid spray or carbolic acid vapour. It is also absorbed by the\r\nskin when outwardly applied, or in the dressing or the spraying of\r\nwounds with carbolic acid. Lastly, the ordinary poisonous effects have\r\nbeen produced by absorption from the bowel, when administered as an\r\nenema. When swallowed undiluted, and in a concentrated form, the\r\nsymptoms may be those of early collapse, and speedy death. Hence, the\r\ncourse is very similar to that witnessed in poisoning by the mineral\r\nacids.\r\n\r\nIf lethal, but not excessive doses of the diluted acid are taken, the\r\nsymptoms are--a burning in the mouth and throat, a peculiarly unpleasant\r\npersistent taste, and vomiting. There is faintness with pallor of the\r\nface, which is covered by a clammy sweat, and the patient soon becomes\r\nunconscious, the pulse small and thready, and the pupils sluggish to\r\nlight. The respiration is profoundly affected; there is dyspnœa, and the\r\nbreathing becomes shallow. Death occurs from paralysis of the\r\nrespiratory apparatus, and the heart is observed to beat for a little\r\nafter the respiration has ceased. All these symptoms may occur from the\r\napplication of the acid to the skin or to mucous membranes, and have\r\nbeen noticed when solutions of but moderate strength have been\r\nused--e.g., there are cases in gynæcological practice in which the\r\nmucous membrane (perhaps eroded) of the uterus has been irrigated with\r\ncarbolic acid injections. Thus, Küster[202] relates a case in which,\r\nfour days after confinement, the uterus was washed out with a 2 per\r\ncent. solution of carbolic acid without evil result. Afterwards a 5 per\r\ncent. solution was used, but it at once caused violent symptoms of\r\npoisoning, the face became livid, clonic convulsions came on, and at\r\nfirst loss of consciousness, which after an hour returned. The patient\r\ndied on the ninth day. There was intense diphtheria of the uterus and\r\nvagina. Several other similar cases (although not attended with such\r\nmarked or fatal effects) are on record.[203]\r\n\r\n[202] _Centralblatt. f. Gynäkologie_, ii. 14, 1878.\r\n\r\n[203] A practitioner in Calcutta injected into the bowel of a boy, aged\r\n5, an enema of diluted carbolic acid, which, according to his own\r\nstatement, was 1 part in 60, and the whole quantity represented 144\r\ngrains of the acid. The child became insensible a few minutes after the\r\noperation, and died within four hours. There was no _post-mortem_\r\nexamination; the body smelt strongly of carbolic acid.--_Lancet_, May\r\n19, 1883.\r\n\r\n§ 225. The symptoms of carbolic acid poisoning admit of considerable\r\nvariation from those already described. The condition is occasionally\r\nthat of deep coma. The convulsions may be general, or may affect only\r\ncertain groups of muscles. Convulsive twitchings of the face alone, and\r\nalso muscular twitchings only of the legs, have been noticed. In all\r\ncases, however, a marked change occurs in the urine. Subissi[204] has\r\nnoted the occurrence of abortion, both in the pig and the mare, as a\r\nresult of carbolic acid, but this effect has not hitherto been recorded\r\nin the human subject.\r\n\r\n[204] _L’Archivio della Veterinaria Ital._, xi., 1874.\r\n\r\nIt has been experimentally shown by Küster, that previous loss of blood,\r\nor the presence of septic fever, renders animals more sensitive to\r\ncarbolic acid. It is also said that children are more sensitive than\r\nadults.\r\n\r\nThe course of carbolic acid poisoning is very rapid. In 35 cases\r\ncollected by Falck, in which the period from the taking of the poison to\r\nthe moment of death was accurately noted, the course was as follows:--12\r\npatients died within the first hour, and in the second hour 3; so that\r\nwithin two hours 15 died. Between the third and the twelfth hour, 10\r\ndied; between the thirteenth and the twenty-fourth hour, 7 died; and\r\nbetween the twenty-fifth and the sixtieth hour, only 3 died. Therefore,\r\nslightly over 71 per cent. died within twelve hours, and 91·4 per cent.\r\nwithin the twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n§ 226. =Changes in the Urine.=--The urine of patients who have absorbed\r\nin any way carbolic acid is dark in colour, and may smell strongly of\r\nthe acid. It is now established--chiefly by the experiments and\r\nobservations of Baumann[205]--that carbolic acid, when introduced into\r\nthe body, is mainly eliminated in the form of phenyl-sulphuric acid,\r\nC₆H₅HSO₄, or more strictly speaking as potassic phenyl-sulphate,\r\nC₆H₅KSO₄, a substance which is not precipitated by chloride of barium\r\nuntil it has been decomposed by boiling with a mineral acid. Cresol is\r\nsimilarly excreted as cresol-sulphuric acid, C₆H₄CH₃HSO₄, ortho-, meta-,\r\nor para-, according to the kind of cresol injected; a portion may also\r\nappear as hydro-tolu-chinone-sulphuric acid. Hence it is that, with\r\ndoses of phenol or cresol continually increasing, the amount of\r\nsulphates naturally in the urine (as estimated by simply acidifying with\r\nhydrochloric acid, and precipitating in the cold with chloride of\r\nbarium) continually decreases, and may at last vanish, for all the\r\nsulphuric acid present is united with the phenol. On the other hand, the\r\nprecipitate obtained by prolonged boiling of the strongly acidified\r\nurine, after filtering off any BaSO₄ thrown down in the cold, is ever\r\nincreasing.\r\n\r\n[205] _Pflüger’s Archiv_, 13, 1876, 289.\r\n\r\nThus, a dog voided urine which contained in 100 c.c., ·262 grm. of\r\nprecipitable sulphuric acid, and ·006 of organically-combined sulphuric\r\nacid; his back was now painted with carbolic acid, and the normal\r\nproportions were reversed, the precipitable sulphuric acid became ·004\r\ngrm., while the organically-combined was ·190 in 100 c.c. In addition to\r\nphenyl-sulphuric acid, it is now sufficiently established[206] that\r\nhydroquinone\r\n\r\n  (    OH)\r\n  (C₆H₄  )\r\n  (    OH)\r\n\r\n(paradihydroxyl phenol) and pyrocatechin\r\n\r\n  (    OH)\r\n  (C₆H₄  )\r\n  (    OH)\r\n\r\n(orthodihydroxyl phenol) are constant products of a portion of the\r\nphenol. The hydroquinone appears in the urine, in the first place, as\r\nthe corresponding ether-sulphuric acid, which is colourless; but a\r\nportion of it is set free, and this free hydroquinone (especially in\r\nalkaline urine) is quickly oxidised to a brownish product, and hence the\r\npeculiar colour of urine. Out of dark coloured carbolic acid urine the\r\nhydroquinone and its products of decomposition can be obtained by\r\nshaking with ether; on separation of the ether, an extract is obtained,\r\nreducing alkaline silver solution, and developing quinone on warming\r\nwith ferric chloride.\r\n\r\n[206] E. Baumann and C. Preuss, _Zeitschrift f. phys. Chemie_, iii. 156;\r\n_Anleitung zur Harn-Analyse_, W. F. Löbisch, Leipzig, 1881, pp. 142,\r\n160; Schmiedeberg, _Chem. Centrbl._ (3), 13, 598.\r\n\r\nTo separate pyro-catechin, 200 c.c. of urine may be evaporated to an\r\nextract, the extract treated with strong alcohol, the alcoholic liquid\r\nevaporated, and the extract then treated with ether. On separation and\r\nevaporation of the ether, a yellowish mass is left, from which the\r\npyro-catechin may be extracted by washing with a small quantity of\r\nwater. This solution will reduce silver solution in the cold, or, if\r\ntreated with a few drops of ferric chloride solution, show a marked\r\ngreen colour, changing on being alkalised by a solution of sodic\r\nhydro-carbonate to violet, and then on being acidified by acetic acid,\r\nchanging back again to green. According to Thudichum,[207] the urine of\r\nmen and dogs, after the ingestion of carbolic acid, contains a blue\r\npigment.\r\n\r\n[207] _On the Pathology of the Urine_, Lond., 1877, p. 198.\r\n\r\n§ 227. =The Action of Carbolic Acid considered\r\nphysiologically.=--Researches on animals have elucidated, in a great\r\nmeasure, the mode in which carbolic acid acts, and the general sequence\r\nof effects, but there is still much to be learnt.\r\n\r\nE. Küster[208] has shown that the temperature of dogs, when doses of\r\ncarbolic acid in solution are injected subcutaneously, or into the\r\nveins, is immediately, or very soon after the operation, raised. With\r\nsmall and moderate doses, this effect is but slight--from half to a\r\nwhole degree--on the day after the injection the temperature sinks below\r\nthe normal point, and only slowly becomes again natural. With doses that\r\nare just lethal, first a rise and then a rapid sinking of temperature\r\nare observed; but with those excessive doses which speedily kill, the\r\ntemperature at once sinks without a preliminary rise. The action on the\r\nheart is not very marked, but there is always a slowing of the cardiac\r\npulsations; according to Hoppe-Seyler the arteries are relaxed. The\r\nrespiration is much quickened; this acceleration is due to an\r\nexcitement of the vagus centre, since Salkowsky has shown that section\r\nof the vagus produces a retardation of the respiratory wave. Direct\r\napplication of the acid to muscles or nerves quickly destroys their\r\nexcitability without a previous stage of excitement. The main cause of\r\nthe lethal action of carbolic acid--putting on one side those cases in\r\nwhich it may kill by its local corrosive action--appears to be paralysis\r\nof the respiratory nervous centres. The convulsions arise from the\r\nspinal cord. On the cessation of the convulsions, the superficial nature\r\nof the breathing assists other changes by preventing the due oxidation\r\nof the blood.\r\n\r\n[208] _Archiv f. klin. Chirurgie_, Bd. 23, S. 133, 1879.\r\n\r\n§ 228. Carbolic acid is separated from the body in the forms already\r\nmentioned, a small portion is also excreted by the skin. Salkowsky\r\nconsiders that, with rabbits, he has also found oxalic acid in the urine\r\nas an oxidation product. According to the researches of Binnendijk,[209]\r\nthe separation of carbolic acid by the urine commences very quickly\r\nafter its ingestion; and, under favourable circumstances, it may be\r\ncompletely excreted within from twelve to sixteen hours. It must be\r\nremembered that normally a small amount of phenol may be present in the\r\nanimal body, as the result of the digestion of albuminous substances or\r\nof their putrefaction. The amount excreted by healthy men when feeding\r\non mixed diet, Engel,[210] by experiment, estimates to be in the\r\ntwenty-four hours 15 mgrms.\r\n\r\n[209] _Journal de Pharmacie et de Chimie._\r\n\r\n[210] _Annal. de Chimie et de Physique_, 5 Sér. T. 20, p. 230, 1880.\r\n\r\n§ 229. =Post-mortem Appearances.=--No fact is better ascertained from\r\nexperiments on animals than the following:--That with lethal doses of\r\ncarbolic acid, administered by subcutaneous injection, or introduced by\r\nthe veins, no appearances may be found after death which can be called\r\nat all characteristic. Further, in the cases in which death has occurred\r\nfrom the outward application of the acid for the cure of scabies, &c.,\r\nno lesion was ascertained after death which could--apart from the\r\nhistory of the case and chemical evidence--with any confidence be\r\nascribed to a poison.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, when somewhat large doses of the acid are taken by\r\nthe mouth, very coarse and appreciable changes are produced in the upper\r\nportion of the alimentary tract. There may be brownish, wrinkled spots\r\non the cheek or lips; the mucous membrane of the mouth, throat, and\r\ngullet is often white, and if the acid was concentrated, eroded. The\r\nstomach is sometimes thickened, contracted, and blanched, a condition\r\nwell shown in a pathological preparation (ix. 206, 43 _f_) in St.\r\nGeorge’s Hospital. The mucous membrane, indeed, may be quite as much\r\ndestroyed as if a mineral acid had been taken. Thus, in Guy’s Hospital\r\nmuseum (1799⁴⁰), there is preserved the stomach of a child who died\r\nfrom taking accidentally carbolic acid. It looks like a piece of paper,\r\nand is very white, with fawn-coloured spots; the rugæ are absent, and\r\nthe mucous membrane seems to have entirely vanished. Not unfrequently\r\nthe stomach exhibits white spots with roundish edges. The duodenum is\r\noften affected, and the action is not always limited to the first part\r\nof the intestine.\r\n\r\nThe respiratory passages are often inflamed, and the lungs infiltrated\r\nand congested. As death takes place from an asphyxiated condition, the\r\nveins of the head and brain, and the blood-vessels of the liver, kidney\r\nand spleen, are gorged with blood, and the right side of the heart\r\ndistended, while the left is empty. On the other hand, a person may die\r\nof sudden nervous shock from the ingestion of a large quantity of the\r\nacid, and in such a case the _post-mortem_ appearances will not then\r\nexhibit precisely the characters just detailed. Putrefaction is retarded\r\naccording to the dose, and there is often a smell of carbolic acid.[211]\r\nIf any urine is contained in the bladder, it will probably be dark, and\r\npresent the characters of carbolic urine, detailed at p. 174.\r\n\r\n[211] In order to detect this odour, it is well to open the head first,\r\nlest the putrefaction of the internal viscera be so great as to mask the\r\nodour.\r\n\r\n\r\nTests for Carbolic Acid.\r\n\r\n§ 230. 1. =The Pinewood Test.=--Certain pinewood gives a beautiful blue\r\ncolour when moistened first with carbolic acid, and afterwards with\r\nhydrochloric acid, and exposed to the light. Some species of pine give a\r\nblue colour with hydrochloric acid alone, and such must not be used;\r\nothers do not respond to the test for carbolic acid. Hence it is\r\nnecessary to try the chips of wood first, to see how they act, and with\r\nthis precaution the test is very serviceable, and, in cautious hands, no\r\nerror will be made.\r\n\r\n2. =Ammonia and Hypochlorite Test.=--If to a solution containing even so\r\nsmall a quantity as 1 part of carbolic acid in 5000 parts of water,\r\nfirst, about a quarter of its volume of ammonia hydrate be added, and\r\nthen a small quantity of sodic hypochlorite solution, avoiding excess, a\r\nblue colour appears, warming quickens the reaction: the blue is\r\npermanent, but turns to red with acids. If there is a smaller quantity\r\nthan the above proportion of acid, the reaction may be still produced\r\nfeebly after standing for some time.\r\n\r\n3. =Ferric Chloride.=--One part of phenol in 3000 parts of water can be\r\ndetected by adding a solution of ferric chloride; a fine violet colour\r\nis produced. This is also a very good test, when applied to a\r\ndistillate; but if applied to a complex liquid, the disturbing action of\r\nneutral salts and other substances may be too great to make the\r\nreaction under those circumstances of service.\r\n\r\n4. =Bromine.=--The most satisfactory test of all is treatment of the\r\nliquid by bromine-water. A precipitate of tri-bromo-phenol (C₆H₃Br₃O) is\r\nrapidly or slowly formed, according to the strength of the solution; in\r\ndetecting very minute quantities the precipitate must be given time to\r\nform. According to Allen,[212] a solution containing but 1/60000 of\r\ncarbolic acid gave the reaction after standing twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n[212] _Commercial Organic Analysis_, vol. i. p. 306.\r\n\r\nThe properties of the precipitate are as follows:--It is crystalline,\r\nand under the microscope is seen to consist of fine stars of needles;\r\nits smell is peculiar; it is insoluble in water and acid liquids, but\r\nsoluble in alkalies, ether, and absolute alcohol; a very minute quantity\r\nof water suffices to precipitate it from an alcoholic solution; it is\r\ntherefore essential to the success of the test that the watery liquid to\r\nbe examined is either neutral or acid in reaction.\r\n\r\n§ 231. Tri-bromo-phenol may be used for the quantitative estimation of\r\ncarbolic acid, 100 parts of tri-bromo-phenol are equal to 29·8 of\r\ncarbolic acid; by the action of sodium amalgam, tri-bromo-phenol is\r\nchanged back into carbolic acid.\r\n\r\nThat bromine-water precipitates several volatile and fixed alkaloids\r\nfrom their solutions is no objection to the bromine test, for it may be\r\napplied to a distillation product, the bases having been previously\r\nfixed by sulphuric acid. Besides, the properties of tri-bromo-phenol are\r\ndistinct enough, and therefore there is no valid objection to the test.\r\nIt is the best hitherto discovered. There are also other reactions, such\r\nas that Millon’s reagent strikes a red--molybdic acid, in concentrated\r\nsulphuric acid, a blue--and potassic dichromate, with sulphuric acid, a\r\nbrown colour--but to these there are objections. Again, we have the\r\n_Euchlorine_ test, in which the procedure is as follows:--A test-tube is\r\ntaken, and concentrated hydrochloric acid is allowed to act therein upon\r\npotassic chlorate. After the gas has been evolved for from 30 to 40\r\nseconds, the liquid is diluted with 1½ volume of water, the gas removed\r\nby blowing through a tube, and solution of strong ammonia poured in so\r\nas to form a layer on the top; after blowing out the white fumes of\r\nammonium chloride, a few drops of the sample to be tested are added. In\r\nthe presence of carbolic acid, a rose-red, blood-red, or red-brown tint\r\nis produced, according to the quantity present. Carbolic acid may be\r\nconfounded with _cresol_ or with _creasote_, but the distinction between\r\npure carbolic acid, pure cresol, and creasote is plain.\r\n\r\n§ 232. =Cresol (Cresylic Acid, Methyl-phenol)=,\r\n\r\n       OH\r\n      /\r\n  C₆H₄     .\r\n      \\\r\n       CH₃\r\n\r\n--There are three cresols--ortho-, meta-, and para-. Ordinary\r\ncommercial cresol is a mixture of the three, but contains but little\r\northo-cresol; the more important properties of the pure cresols are set\r\nout in the following table:--\r\n\r\n  +--------+-----------------+----------------+---------------------+\r\n  |        | Melting-point.  | Boiling-point. | Converted by fusion |\r\n  |        |                 |                | with Potash into--  |\r\n  +--------+-----------------+----------------+---------------------+\r\n  |Ortho-, |   31-31·5° C.   |    188·0°      |   Salicylic Acid    |\r\n  |        |                 |                | (Ortho-oxybenzoic   |\r\n  |        |                 |                |      acid).         |\r\n  |        |                 |                |                     |\r\n  |Meta-,  |Fluid at ordinary|    201·0°      |  Meta-oxybenzoic    |\r\n  |        |   temperature.  |                |      acid.          |\r\n  |        |                 |                |                     |\r\n  |Para-,  |     36°         |    198°        |Para-oxybenzoic acid.|\r\n  +--------+-----------------+----------------+---------------------+\r\n\r\nPure ortho-, meta-, or para-cresol have been obtained by synthetical\r\nmethods; they cannot be said to be in ordinary commerce.\r\n\r\n=Commercial cresol= is at ordinary temperatures a liquid, and cannot be\r\nobtained in a crystalline state by freezing. Its boiling-point is from\r\n198° to 203°; it is almost insoluble in strong ammonia, and, when 16\r\nvolumes are added, it then forms crystalline scales. On the other hand,\r\ncarbolic acid is soluble in an equal volume of ammonia, and is then\r\nprecipitated by the addition of 1½ volume of water. Cresol is insoluble\r\nin small quantities of pure 6 per cent. soda solution; with a large\r\nexcess, it forms crystalline scales; while carbolic acid is freely\r\nsoluble in small or large quantities of alkaline solutions.\r\n\r\nCold petroleum spirit dissolves cresol, but no crystalline scales can be\r\nseparated out by a freezing mixture. Carbolic acid, on the contrary, is\r\nbut sparingly soluble in cold petroleum, and a solution of carbolic acid\r\nin hot petroleum, when exposed to sudden cold produced by a freezing\r\nmixture, separates out crystals from the upper layer of liquid. Cresol\r\nis miscible with glycerin of specific gravity 1·258 in all proportions;\r\n1 measure of glycerin mixed with 1 measure of cresol is completely\r\nprecipitated by 1 measure of water. Carbolic acid, under the same\r\ncircumstances, is not precipitated. The density of cresol is about\r\n1·044. It forms with bromine a tri-bromo-cresol, but this is liquid at\r\nordinary temperatures, while tri-bromo-phenol is solid. On the other\r\nhand, it resembles carbolic acid in its reactions with ferric chloride\r\nand with nitric and sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\n    § 233. =Creasote= or =Kreozote= is a term applied to the mixture of\r\n    crude phenols obtained from the distillation of wood-tar. It\r\n    consists of a mixture of substances of which the chief are guaiacol\r\n    or oxycresol (C₇H₈O₂), boiling at 200°, and creasol (C₈H₁₀O₂),\r\n    boiling at 217°; also in small quantities phlorol (C₈H₁₀O), methyl\r\n    creasol (C₉H₁₂O₂), and other bodies. Morson’s English creasote is\r\n    prepared from Stockholm tar, and boils at about 217°, consisting\r\n    chiefly of creasol; it is not easy, by mere chemical tests, to\r\n    distinguish creasote from cresylic acid. Creasote, in its reactions\r\n    with sulphuric and nitric acid, bromine and gelatin, is similar to\r\n    carbolic and cresylic acids, and its solubility in most solvents is\r\n    also similar. It is, however, distinguished from the tar acids by\r\n    its insolubility in Price’s glycerin, specific gravity 1·258,\r\n    whether 1, 2, or 3 volumes of glycerin be employed. But the best\r\n    test is its action on an ethereal solution of nitro-cellulose.\r\n    Creasote mixes freely with the B.P. collodium, while cresylic acid\r\n    or carbolic acid at once coagulates the latter. With complicated\r\n    mixtures containing carbolic acid, cresol, and creasote, the only\r\n    method of applying these tests with advantage is to submit the\r\n    mixture to fractional distillation.\r\n\r\n    Flückiger[213] tests for small quantities of carbolic acid in\r\n    creasote, by mixing a watery solution of the sample with one-fourth\r\n    of its volume of ammonia hydrate, wetting the inside of a porcelain\r\n    dish with this solution, and then carefully blowing bromine fumes on\r\n    to the surface. A fine blue colour appears if carbolic acid is\r\n    present, but if the sample consists of creasote only, then it is\r\n    dirty green or brown. Excess of bromine spoils the reaction.[214]\r\n\r\n[213] _Arch. der Pharmacie_, cxiii. p. 30.\r\n\r\n[214] Creasote is, without doubt, poisonous, though but little is known\r\nof its action, and very few experiments are on record in which pure\r\ncreasote has been employed. Eulenberg has studied the symptoms in\r\nrabbits, by submitting them to vaporised creasote--_i.e._, the vapour\r\nfrom 20 drops of creasote diffused through a glass shade under which a\r\nrabbit was confined. There was at once great uneasiness, with a watery\r\ndischarge from the eyes, and after seven minutes the rabbit fell on its\r\nside, and was slightly convulsed. The cornea was troubled, and the eyes\r\nprominent; a white slime flowed from the mouth and eyes. After fifteen\r\nminutes there was narcosis, with lessened reflex action; the temperature\r\nwas almost normal. There was rattling breathing, and in half an hour the\r\nanimal died, the respiration ceasing, and fluid blood escaping from the\r\nnose. Section after death showed the brain to be hyperæmic, the mucous\r\nmembranes of the air-passages to be covered with a thin layer of fluid\r\nblood, and the lungs to be congested; the right side of the heart was\r\ngorged with fluid blood.\r\n\r\nThe _post-mortem_ appearances and the symptoms generally are, therefore,\r\nclosely allied to those produced by carbolic acid. A dark colour of the\r\nurine has also been noticed.\r\n\r\n§ 234. =Carbolic Acid in Organic Fluids or in the Tissues of the\r\nBody.=--If the routine process given at page 51, where the organic fluid\r\nis distilled in a vacuum after acidifying with tartaric acid, is\r\nemployed, phenol or cresol, if present, will certainly be found in the\r\ndistillate. If, however, a special search be made for the acids, then\r\nthe fluid must be well acidified with sulphuric acid, and distilled in\r\nthe usual way. The distillation should be continued as long as possible,\r\nand the distillate shaken up with ether in the apparatus figured at page\r\n156. On separation and evaporation of the ether, the tar acids, if\r\npresent, will be left in a pure enough form to show its reactions. The\r\nsame process applies to the tissues, which, in a finely-divided state,\r\nare boiled and distilled with dilute sulphuric acid, and the distillate\r\ntreated as just detailed.\r\n\r\nLike most poisons, carbolic acid has a selective attraction for certain\r\norgans, so that, unless all the organs are examined, it is by no means\r\nindifferent which particular portion is selected for the inquiry.\r\nHoppe-Seyler applied carbolic acid to the abdomen and thighs of dogs,\r\nand when the symptoms were at their height bled them to death, and\r\nseparately examined the parts. In one case, the blood yielded ·00369 per\r\ncent.; the brain, ·0034 per cent.; the liver, ·00125; and the kidneys,\r\n·00423 per cent. of their weight of carbolic acid. The liver then\r\ncontains only one-third of the quantity found in an equal weight of\r\nblood, and, therefore, the acid has no selective affinity for that\r\norgan. On the other hand, the nervous tissue, and especially the\r\nkidneys, appear to concentrate it.\r\n\r\n§ 235. =Examination of the Urine for Phenol or Cresol.=--It has been\r\npreviously stated (see p. 174) that the urine will not contain these as\r\nsuch, but as compounds--viz., phenyl or cresyl sulphate of potassium. By\r\nboiling with a mineral acid, these compounds may be broken up, and the\r\nacids obtained, either by distillation or by extraction with ether. To\r\ndetect very minute quantities, a large quantity of the urine should be\r\nevaporated down to a syrup, and treated with hydrochloric acid and\r\nether. On evaporating off the ether, the residue should be distilled\r\nwith dilute sulphuric acid, and this distillate then tested with\r\nbromine-water, and the tri-bromo-phenol or cresol collected, identified,\r\nand weighed.\r\n\r\nThudichum[215] has separated crystals of potassic phenyl-sulphate itself\r\nfrom the urine of patients treated endermically by carbolic acid, as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n[215] _Pathology of the Urine_, p. 193.\r\n\r\nThe urine was evaporated to a syrup, extracted with alcohol of 90 per\r\ncent., treated with an alcoholic solution of oxalic acid as long as this\r\nproduced a precipitate, and then shaken with an equal volume of ether.\r\nThe mixture was next filtered, neutralised with potassic carbonate,\r\nevaporated to a small bulk, and again taken up with alcohol. Some\r\noxalate and carbonate of potassium were separated, and, on evaporation\r\nto a syrup, crystals of potassic phenyl-sulphate were obtained. They\r\ngave to analysis 46·25 per cent. H₂SO₄, and 18·1 K--theory requiring\r\n46·2 of H₂SO₄ and 18·4 of K. Alkaline phenyl-sulphates strike a deep\r\npurple colour with ferric chloride. To estimate the amount of\r\nphenyl-sulphate or cresol-sulphate in the urine, the normal sulphates\r\nmay be separated by the addition of chloride of barium in the cold,\r\nfirst acidifying with hydrochloric acid. On boiling the liquid a second\r\ncrop of sulphate is obtained, due to the breaking up of the compound\r\nsulphate, and from this second weight the amount of acid can be\r\nobtained, _e.g._, in the case of phenol--C₆H₅HSO₄ : BaSO₄ :: 174 : 233.\r\n\r\n    § 236. =Assay of Disinfectants, Carbolic Acid Powders, &c.=--For the\r\n    assay of crude carbolic acid, Mr. Charles Lowe[216] uses the\r\n    following process:--A thousand parts of the sample are distilled\r\n    without any special condensing arrangement; water first comes over,\r\n    and is then followed by an oily fluid. When a hundred parts of the\r\n    latter, as measured in a graduated tube, have been collected, the\r\n    receiver is changed. The volume of water is read off. If the oily\r\n    liquid floats on the water, it contains light oil of tar; if it is\r\n    heavier than the water, it is regarded as hydrated acid, containing\r\n    50 per cent. of real carbolic acid. The next portion consists of\r\n    anhydrous cresylic and carbolic acids, and 625 volumes are distilled\r\n    over; the remainder in the retort consists wholly of cresylic acid\r\n    and the higher homologues. The relative proportions of carbolic and\r\n    cresylic acids are approximately determined by taking the\r\n    solidifying point, which should be between 15·5° and 24°, and having\r\n    ascertained this temperature, imitating it by making mixtures of\r\n    known proportions of carbolic and cresylic acids.\r\n\r\n[216] _Allen’s Commercial Organic Analysis_, vol. i. p. 311.\r\n\r\n    E. Waller[217] has recommended the following process for the\r\n    estimation of carbolic acid. It is based on the precipitation of the\r\n    tar acids by bromine, and, of course, all phenols precipitated in\r\n    this way will be returned as carbolic acid. The solutions necessary\r\n    are--\r\n\r\n[217] _Chem. News_, April 1, 1881, p. 152.\r\n\r\n    1. A solution containing 10 grms. of pure carbolic acid to the\r\n    litre; this serves as a standard solution.\r\n\r\n    2. A solution of bromine in water.\r\n\r\n    3. Solution of alum in dilute sulphuric acid. A litre of 10 per\r\n    cent. sulphuric acid is shaken with alum crystals until saturated.\r\n\r\n    The actual process is as follows:--10 grms. of the sample are\r\n    weighed out and run into a litre flask, water added, and the mixture\r\n    shaken. The flask being finally filled up to the neck, some of the\r\n    solution is now filtered through a dry filter, and 10 c.c. of this\r\n    filtrate is placed in a 6 or 8-ounce stoppered bottle, and 30 c.c.\r\n    of the alum solution added. In a similar bottle 10 c.c. of the\r\n    standard solution of carbolic acid are placed, and a similar\r\n    quantity of alum solution is added, as in the first bottle. The\r\n    bromine-water is now run into the bottle containing the standard\r\n    solution of carbolic acid from a burette until there is no further\r\n    precipitate; the bottle is stoppered and shaken after every\r\n    addition. Towards the end of the reaction the precipitate forms but\r\n    slowly, and when the carbolic acid is saturated, the slight excess\r\n    of bromine-water gives the solution a pale yellow tint. The solution\r\n    from the sample is treated in the same way, and from the amount of\r\n    bromine-water used, the percentage of the sample is obtained by\r\n    making the usual calculations. Thus, supposing that 5 c.c. of the\r\n    standard required 15 c.c. of the bromine-water for precipitation,\r\n    and 10 c.c. of the solution of the sample required 17 c.c., the\r\n    calculation would be 15 × 2 : 17 = 100 : _x_ per cent. With most\r\n    samples of crude carbolic acid, the precipitate does not readily\r\n    separate. It is then best to add a little of the precipitate already\r\n    obtained by testing the standard solution, which rapidly clears the\r\n    liquid.\r\n\r\n    =Koppeschaar’s volumetric method= is more exact, but also more\r\n    elaborate, than the one just described. Caustic normal soda is\r\n    treated with bromine until permanently yellow, and the excess of\r\n    bromine is then driven off by boiling. The liquid now contains 5NaBr\r\n    + NaBrO₃, and on adding this to a solution containing carbolic acid,\r\n    and a sufficient quantity of hydrochloric acid to combine with the\r\n    sodium, the following reactions occur:--\r\n\r\n  (1.) 5NaBr + NaBrO₃ + 6HCl = 6NaCl + 6Br + 3H₂O;\r\n\r\n    and\r\n\r\n  (2.) C₆H₆O + 6Br = C₆H₃Br₃O + 3HBr.\r\n\r\n    Any excess of bromine liberated in the first reaction above that\r\n    necessary for the second, will exist in the free state, and from the\r\n    amount of bromine which remains free the quantity of carbolic acid\r\n    can be calculated, always provided the strength of the bromine\r\n    solution is first known. The volumetric part of the analysis,\r\n    therefore, merely amounts to the determination of free bromine,\r\n    which is best found by causing it to react on potassium iodide, and\r\n    ascertaining the amount of free iodine by titration with a standard\r\n    solution of sodium thiosulphate. In other words, titrate in this way\r\n    the standard alkaline bromine solution, using as an indicator starch\r\n    paste until the blue colour disappears. Another method of indicating\r\n    the end of the reaction is by the use of strips of paper first\r\n    soaked in starch solution, and dried, and then the same papers\r\n    moistened with zinc iodide, and again dried; the least excess of\r\n    bromine sets free iodine, and strikes a blue colour.\r\n\r\n    =Colorimetric Method of Estimation.=--A very simple and ever-ready\r\n    way of approximately estimating minute quantities of the phenols\r\n    consists in shaking up 10 grms. of the sample with water, allowing\r\n    any tar or insoluble impurities to subside. Ten c.c. of the clear\r\n    fluid are then taken, and half a c.c. of a 5 per cent. solution of\r\n    ferric chloride added. The colour produced is imitated by a standard\r\n    solution of carbolic acid, and a similar amount of the reagent, on\r\n    the usual principles of colorimetric analysis.\r\n\r\n    § 237. =Carbolic Acid Powders.=--Siliceous carbolic acid powders are\r\n    placed in a retort and distilled. Towards the end the heat may be\r\n    raised to approaching redness. The distillate separates into two\r\n    portions--the one aqueous, the other consisting of the acids--and\r\n    the volume may be read off, if the distillate be received in a\r\n    graduated receiver. Carbolic acid powders, having lime as a basis,\r\n    may be distilled in the same way, after first decomposing with\r\n    sulphuric acid. The estimation of the neutral tar oils in the\r\n    distillate is easily performed by shaking the distillate with\r\n    caustic soda solution, which dissolves completely the tar acids. The\r\n    volume of the oils may be directly read off if the receiver is a\r\n    graduated tube. Allen[218] has suggested the addition of a known\r\n    volume of petroleum to the distillate, which dissolves the tar oils,\r\n    and easily separates, and thus the volume may be more accurately\r\n    determined, a correction being of course made by subtracting the\r\n    volume of petroleum first added.\r\n\r\n[218] _Op. cit._, i. p. 310.\r\n\r\n    § 238. =Carbolic Acid Soap.=--A convenient quantity of soap is\r\n    carefully weighed, and dissolved in a solution of caustic soda by\r\n    means of heat. A saturated solution of salt is next added,\r\n    sufficient to precipitate entirely the soap, which is filtered off;\r\n    the filtrate is acidified with hydrochloric acid, and bromine water\r\n    added. The precipitated tribromo-phenol is first melted by heat,\r\n    then allowed to cool, and the mass removed from the liquid, dried,\r\n    and weighed.\r\n\r\n\r\nX.--Nitro-Benzene.\r\n\r\n§ 239.--Nitro-benzene is the product resulting from the action of strong\r\nnitric acid on benzene. Its chemical formula is C₆H₅NO₂. When pure, it\r\nis of a pale yellow colour, of a density of 1·186, and boils at from\r\n205° to 210°. It may be obtained in prismatic crystals by exposure to a\r\ntemperature of 3°. Its smell is exactly the same as that from the oil or\r\nessence of bitter almonds; and it is from this circumstance, under the\r\nname of “essence of mirbane,” much used in the preparation of perfumes\r\nand flavouring agents.\r\n\r\nIn commerce there are three kinds of nitro-benzene--the purest, with the\r\ncharacters given above; a heavier nitro-benzene, boiling at 210° to\r\n220°; and a very heavy variety, boiling at 222° to 235° The last is\r\nspecially used for the preparation of aniline, or aniline blue.\r\nNitro-benzene has been used as an adulterant of bitter almond oil, but\r\nthe detection is easy (see “Foods,” p. 551). Nitro-benzene was first\r\ndiscovered by Mitscherlich in 1834, and its poisonous properties were\r\nfirst pointed out by Casper[219] in 1859. Its technical use in perfumes,\r\n&c., dates from about 1848, and in the twenty-eight years intervening\r\nbetween that date and 1876, Jübell[220] has collected 42 cases of\r\npoisoning by this agent, 13 of which were fatal. One of these cases was\r\nsuicidal, the rest accidental.\r\n\r\n[219] _Vierteljahrsschrift für ger. Med._, 1859, Bd. xvi. p. 1.\r\n\r\n[220] _Die Vergiftungen mit Blausäure u. Nitro-benzol in forensischer\r\nBeziehung_, Erlangen, 1876.\r\n\r\n§ 240. =Effects of Poisoning by Nitro-benzene.=--Nitro-benzene is a very\r\npowerful poison, whether taken in the form of vapour or as a liquid. The\r\naction of the vapour on animals has been studied by Eulenberg[221] and\r\nothers. One experiment will serve as an illustration. Fifteen grms. of\r\nnitro-benzene were evaporated on warm sand under a glass shade, into\r\nwhich a cat was introduced. There was immediately observed in the animal\r\nmuch salivation, and quickened and laboured breathing. After thirty\r\nminutes’ exposure, on removing the shade to repeat the dose of 15 grms.,\r\nthe cat for the moment escaped. On being put back there was again\r\nnoticed the salivation and running at the eyes, with giddiness, and\r\nrepeated rising and falling. The animal at last, about one hour and\r\nforty minutes after the first dose, succumbed with dyspnœa, and died\r\nwith progressive paralysis of the respiration. The membranes of the\r\nbrain were found gorged with blood, the lungs liver-coloured, the mucous\r\nmembrane of the trachea--to the finest sub-divisions of the\r\nbronchia--reddened, inflamed, and clothed with a fine frothy mucus. The\r\nleft side of the heart was filled with thick black blood. The bladder\r\ncontained 8 grms. of clear urine, in which aniline was discovered. There\r\nwas a notable smell of bitter almonds.\r\n\r\n[221] _Gewerbe Hygiene_, S. 607, Berlin, 1876.\r\n\r\n§ 241. The effects of the vapour on man are somewhat different in their\r\ndetails to those just described. In a remarkable case related by Dr.\r\nLetheby, a man, aged 42, had spilt some nitro-benzene over his clothes.\r\nHe went about several hours breathing an atmosphere of nitro-benzene, he\r\nthen became drowsy, his expression was stupid, and his gait unsteady,\r\npresenting all the appearances of intoxication. The stupor suddenly\r\ndeepened into coma, and the man died; the fatal course being altogether\r\nabout nine hours--viz., four hours before coma, and five hours of total\r\ninsensibility.\r\n\r\nAn interesting case of poisoning by the vapour is recorded by\r\nTaylor.[222] A woman, aged 30, tasted a liquid used for flavouring\r\npastry, which was afterwards chemically identified as pure\r\nnitro-benzene. She immediately spat it out, finding that it had an acrid\r\ntaste, and probably did not swallow more than a drop. In replacing the\r\nbottle, however, she spilt about a tablespoonful, and allowed it to\r\nremain for some minutes; it was a small room, and the vapour rapidly\r\npervaded it, and caused illness in herself as well as in a\r\nfellow-servant. She had a strange feeling of numbness in the tongue, and\r\nin three hours and a quarter after the accident was seen by a medical\r\nman; she then presented all the appearances of prussic acid poisoning.\r\nThe eyes were bright and glassy, the features pale and ghastly, the lips\r\nand nails purple, as if stained with blackberries, the skin clammy, and\r\nthe pulse feeble, but the mind was then clear. An emetic was\r\nadministered, but she suddenly became unconscious; the emetic acted, and\r\nbrought up a fluid with an odour of nitro-benzene. The stomach-pump was\r\nalso used, but the liquid obtained had scarcely any odour of\r\nnitro-benzene. In about eleven hours consciousness returned, and in\r\nabout seventeen hours she partially recovered, but complained of flashes\r\nof light and strange colours before her eyes. Recovery was not complete\r\nfor weeks. In this case the small quantity swallowed would probably of\r\nitself have produced no symptoms, and the effects are to be mainly\r\nascribed to the breathing of the vapour.\r\n\r\n[222] _Poisons_, Third Edition, p. 665.\r\n\r\n§ 242. The liquid, when swallowed, acts almost precisely in the same way\r\nas the vapour, and the symptoms resemble very much those produced by\r\nprussic acid. The great distinction between prussic acid and\r\nnitro-benzene poisoning is that, in the latter, there is an interval\r\nbetween the taking of the poison and its effects. This is, indeed, one\r\nof the strangest phenomena of nitro-benzene poisoning, for the person,\r\nafter taking it, may appear perfectly well for periods varying from a\r\nquarter of an hour to two or three hours, or even longer, and then there\r\nmay be most alarming symptoms, followed by rapid death. Poisoning by\r\nnitro-benzene satisfies the ideal of the dramatist, who requires, for\r\nthe purposes of his plot, poisons not acting at once, but with an\r\ninterval sufficiently prolonged to admit of lengthy rhapsodies and a\r\ncomplicated _dénouement_. On drinking the poison there is a burning\r\ntaste in the mouth, shortly followed by a very striking blueness or\r\npurple appearance of the lips, tongue, skin, nails, and even the\r\nconjunctivæ. This curious colour of the skin has, in one or two\r\ninstances, been witnessed an hour before any feeling of illness\r\nmanifested itself; vomiting then comes on, the vomited matter smelling\r\nof nitro-benzene. The skin is cold, there is great depression, and the\r\npulse is small and weak. The respiration is affected, the breathing\r\nbeing slow and irregular, the breath smelling strongly of the liquid,\r\nand the odour often persisting for days. A further stage is that of loss\r\nof consciousness, and this comes on with all the suddenness of a fit of\r\napoplexy. The coma is also similar in appearance to apoplectic coma,\r\nbut there have frequently been seen trismus and convulsions of the\r\nextremities. The pupils are dilated and do not react to light, and\r\nreflex sensibility is sometimes completely extinguished. Cases vary a\r\nlittle in their main features; in a few the blue skin and the deep sleep\r\nare the only symptoms noted. Death, for the most part, occurs after a\r\nperiod of from eight to twenty-four hours (occasionally as soon as four\r\nor five hours) after taking the poison.\r\n\r\nFrom the following remarkable train of symptoms in a dog, it is\r\nprobable, indeed, that nitro-benzene, taken by a human being, might\r\nproduce death, after a rather prolonged period of time, by its secondary\r\neffects:--To a half-bred greyhound[223] were administered 15 grms. of\r\nnitro-benzene, when shortly after there were noticed much salivation,\r\nshivering, and muscular twitchings. The same dose was repeated at the\r\nend of five, of seven, and of eight hours respectively, so that the dog\r\naltogether took 60 grms., but with no other apparent symptom than the\r\nprofuse salivation. On the following day, the dog voided a tapeworm;\r\nvomiting supervened; the heart’s action was quickened, and the breathing\r\ndifficult; convulsions followed, and the pupils were seen to be dilated.\r\nFor eight days the dog suffered from dyspnœa, quickened pulse, shivering\r\nof the legs or of the whole body, tetanic spasms, bloody motions, great\r\nthirst and debility. The temperature gradually sank under 25°, and the\r\nanimal finally died. The autopsy showed, as the most striking change,\r\nthe whole mucous membrane of the intestinal tract covered with a yellow\r\nlayer, which chemical analysis proved to be caused by picric acid, and\r\nin the urine, liver, and lungs, aniline was discovered.\r\n\r\n[223] Eulenberg, _Gewerbe Hygiene_, S. 607.\r\n\r\n§ 243. =Fatal Dose.=--It is probable, from recorded cases, that 1 grm.\r\n(15·4 grains) would be quite sufficient to kill an adult, and, under\r\nfavourable circumstances, less than that quantity. It would seem that\r\nspirituous liquids especially hasten and intensify the action of\r\nnitro-benzene, so that a drunken person, _cæteris paribus_, taking the\r\npoison with spirits, would be more affected than taking it under other\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nIn a case related by Stevenson,[224] in which so small a quantity as\r\n1·74 grm. was taken in seven doses, spread over more than forty-eight\r\nhours; there were yet extremely alarming symptoms, and the patient seems\r\nto have had a narrow escape. On the other hand, a woman admitted into\r\nthe General Hospital, Vienna, took 100 grms. (about 3½ ozs.) and\r\nrecovered; on admission she was in a highly cyanotic condition, with\r\nsmall pulse, superficial respiration, and dribbling of urine, which\r\ncontained nitro-benzol. Artificial respiration was practised, and\r\ncamphor injections were administered. Under this treatment consciousness\r\nwas restored, and the patient recovered. On the fourth day the urine\r\nresembled that of a case of cystitis (_Lancet_, Jan. 16, 1894). The\r\nquantity of nitro-benzene which would be fatal, if breathed, is not\r\nknown with any accuracy.\r\n\r\n[224] This case is not uninteresting. Through a mistake in reading an\r\nextremely illegible prescription, M. S. S., æt. 21, was supplied by a\r\ndruggist with the following mixture;--\r\n\r\n  ℞. Benzole-Nit., ʒiij.\r\n     Ol. Menth, pep., ʒss.\r\n     Ol. Olivæ, ʒx.\r\n     gutt. xxx., t. ds.\r\n\r\nHe took on sugar seven doses, each of 20 minims, equalling in all 23\r\nmin. (or by weight 27·1 grains, 1·74 grm.) of nitro-benzene--viz., three\r\ndoses on the first day, three on the second, and one on the morning of\r\nthe third day. The first two days he was observed to be looking pale and\r\nill, but went on with his work until the seventh dose, which he took on\r\nthe third day at 9 A.M. About 2 P.M. (or six hours after taking the\r\nseventh dose), he fell down insensible, the body pale blue, and with all\r\nthe symptoms already described in the text, and usually seen in\r\nnitro-benzene poisoning. With suitable treatment he recovered. The next\r\nmorning, from 8 ounces of urine some nitro-benzene was extracted by\r\nshaking with chloroform.--Thos. Stevenson, M.D., in _Guy’s Hospital\r\nReports_, MS., vol. xxi., 1876.\r\n\r\n§ 244. =Pathological Appearances.=--The more characteristic appearances\r\nseem to be, a dark brown or even black colour of the blood, which\r\ncoagulates with difficulty (an appearance of the blood that has even\r\nbeen noticed during life), venous hyperæmia of the brain and its\r\nmembranes, and general venous engorgement. In the stomach, when the\r\nfluid has been swallowed, the mucous membrane is sometimes reddened\r\ndiffusely, and occasionally shows ecchymoses of a punctiform character.\r\n\r\n§ 245. =The essential action of nitro-benzene= is of considerable\r\nphysiological interest. The blood is certainly in some way changed, and\r\ngives the spectrum of acid hæmatin.[225] Filehne has found that the\r\nblood loses, in a great degree, the power of carrying and imparting\r\noxygen to the tissues, and its content of carbon dioxide is also\r\nincreased. Thus, the normal amount of oxygen gas which the arterial\r\nblood of a hound will give up is 17 per cent.; but in the case of a dog\r\nwhich had been poisoned with nitro-benzene, it sank to 1 per cent.\r\nDuring the dyspnœa from which the dog suffered, the carbon dioxide\r\nexhaled was greater than the normal amount, and the arterial blood (the\r\nnatural content of which should have been 30 per cent. of this gas),\r\nonly gave up 9 per cent. Filehne seeks to explain the peculiar colour of\r\nthe skin by the condition of the blood, but the explanation is not\r\naltogether satisfactory. Some part of the nitro-benzene, without doubt,\r\nis reduced to aniline in the body--an assertion often made, and as often\r\ncontradicted--but it has been found in too many cases to admit of\r\nquestion. It would also seem from the experiment on the dog (p. 186),\r\nthat a conversion into picric acid is not impossible. A yellow colour\r\nof the skin and conjunctivæ, as if picric-acid-stained, has been noticed\r\nin men suffering under slow poisoning by nitro-benzene.\r\n\r\n[225] Filehne, W., “_Ueber die Gift-Wirkungen des Nitrobenzols_,” _Arch.\r\nfür exper. Pathol. u. Pharm._, ix. 329.\r\n\r\n§ 246. =Detection and Separation of Nitro-Benzene from the Animal\r\nTissues.=--It is evident from the changes which nitro-benzene may\r\nundergo that the expert, in any case of suspected nitro-benzene\r\npoisoning, must specially look (1) for nitro-benzene, (2) for aniline,\r\nand (3) for picric acid. The best general method for the separation of\r\nnitro-benzene is to shake up the liquid (or finely-divided solid) with\r\nlight benzoline (petroleum ether), which readily dissolves\r\nnitro-benzene. On evaporation of the petroleum ether, the nitro-benzene\r\nis left, perhaps mixed with fatty matters. On treating with cold water,\r\nthe fats rise to the surface, and the nitro-benzene sinks to the bottom;\r\nso that, by means of a separating funnel, the nitro-benzene may be\r\neasily removed from animal fats. The oily drops, or fine precipitate\r\nbelieved to be nitro-benzene, may be dissolved in spirit and reduced to\r\naniline by the use of nascent hydrogen, developed from iron filings by\r\nhydrochloric acid, and the fluid tested with bleaching powder, or, the\r\naniline itself may be recovered by alkalising the fluid, and shaking up\r\nwith ether in the separation-tube (p. 156), the ether dissolves the\r\naniline, and leaves it, on spontaneous evaporation, as an oily yellowish\r\nmass, which, on the addition of a few drops of sodic hypochlorite,\r\nstrikes a blue or violet-blue--with acids, a rose-red--and with bromine,\r\na flesh-red. It gives alkaloidal reactions with such general reagents as\r\nplatinum chloride, picric acid, &c. Aniline itself may be extracted from\r\nthe tissues and fluids of the body by petroleum ether, but in any\r\nspecial search it will be better to treat the organs as in Stas’\r\nprocess--that is, with strong alcohol, acidified with sulphuric acid.\r\nAfter a suitable digestion in this menstruum, filter, and then, after\r\nevaporating the alcohol, dissolve the alcoholic extract in water;\r\nalkalise the aqueous solution, and extract the aniline by shaking it up\r\nwith light benzoline. On separating the benzoline, the aniline will be\r\nleft, and may be dissolved in feebly-acid water, and the tests before\r\nenumerated tried.\r\n\r\nMalpurgo[226] recommends the following test for nitro-benzene:--2 drops\r\nof melted phenol, 3 drops of water, and a fragment of caustic potash are\r\nboiled in a small porcelain dish, and to the boiling liquid the aqueous\r\nsolution to be tested is added. On prolonged boiling, if nitro-benzene\r\nis present, a crimson ring is produced at the edges of the liquid; this\r\ncrimson colour, on the addition of a little bleaching powder, turns\r\nemerald-green.\r\n\r\n[226] _Zeit. anal. Chem._, xxxii. 235.\r\n\r\nOil of bitter almonds may be distinguished from nitro-benzene by the\r\naction of manganese dioxide and sulphuric acid; bitter almond oil\r\ntreated in this way loses its odour, nitro-benzene is unaltered. To\r\napply the test, the liquid must be heated on the water-bath for a little\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.--Dinitro-benzol.\r\n\r\n§ 247. =Dinitro-benzol=, C₆H₄(NO₂)₂ (ortho-, meta-, para-).--The\r\northo-compound is produced by the action of nitric acid on benzol, aided\r\nby heat in the absence of strong sulphuric acid to fix water. Some of\r\nthe para-dinitro-benzol is at the same time produced. The meta-compound\r\nis obtained by the action of fuming nitric acid on nitro-benzol at a\r\nboiling temperature.\r\n\r\nThe physical properties of the three dinitro-benzols are briefly as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\nOrtho-d. is in the form of needles; m.p. 118°.\r\n\r\nMeta-d. crystallises in plates; m.p. 90°.\r\n\r\nPara-d. crystallises, like the ortho-compound, in needles, but the\r\nmelting-point is much higher, 171° to 172°.\r\n\r\nJust as nitro-benzol by reduction yields aniline, so do the\r\nnitro-benzols on reduction yield ortho-, meta-, or para-phenylene\r\ndiamines.\r\n\r\nMeta-phenylene diamine is an excellent test for nitrites; and, since the\r\ncommercial varieties of dinitro-benzol either consist mainly or in part\r\nof meta-dinitro-benzol, the toxicological detection is fairly simple,\r\nand is based upon the conversion of the dinitro-benzol into\r\nmeta-phenylene-diamine.\r\n\r\nDinitro-benzol is at present largely employed in the manufacture of\r\nexplosives, such as roburite, sicherheit, and others. It has produced\r\nmuch illness among the workpeople in the manufactures, and amongst\r\nminers whose duty it has been to handle such explosives.\r\n\r\n§ 248. =Effects of Dinitro-benzol.=--Huber[227] finds that if\r\ndinitro-benzol is given to frogs by the mouth in doses of from 100 to\r\n200 mgrms., death takes place in a few hours. Doses of from 2·5 to 5\r\nmgrms. cause general dulness and ultimately complete paralysis, and\r\ndeath in from one to six days.\r\n\r\n[227] “_Beiträge zur Giftwirkung des Dinitrobenzols_,” A. Huber,\r\nVirchow’s _Archiv_, 1891, Bd. 126, S. 240.\r\n\r\nRabbits are killed by doses of 400 mgrms., in time varying from\r\ntwenty-two hours to four days.\r\n\r\nIn a single experiment on a small dog, the weight of which was 5525\r\ngrms., the dog died in six hours after a dose of 600 mgrms.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore probable that a dose of 100 mgrms. per kilo would kill\r\nmost warm-blooded animals.\r\n\r\nA transient exposure to dinitro-benzol vapours in man causes serious\r\nsymptoms; for instance, in one of Huber’s cases, a student of chemistry\r\nhad been engaged for one hour and a half only in preparing\r\ndinitro-benzol, and soon afterwards his comrades remarked that his face\r\nwas of a deep blue colour. On admission to hospital, on the evening of\r\nthe same day, he complained of slight headache and sleeplessness; both\r\ncheeks, the lips, the muscles of the ear, the mucous membrane of the\r\nlips and cheeks, and even the tongue, were all of a more or less intense\r\nblue-grey colour. The pulse was dicrotic, 124; T. 37·2°. The next\r\nmorning the pulse was slower, and by the third day the patient had\r\nrecovered.\r\n\r\nExcellent accounts of the effects of dinitro-benzol in roburite\r\nfactories have been published by Dr. Ross[228] and Professor White,[229]\r\nof Wigan. Mr. Simeon Snell[230] has also published some most interesting\r\ncases of illness, cases which have been as completely investigated as\r\npossible. As an example of the symptoms produced, one of Mr. Snell’s\r\ncases may be here quoted.\r\n\r\n[228] _Medical Chronicle_, 1889, 89.\r\n\r\n[229] _Practitioner_, 1889, ii. 15.\r\n\r\n[230] _Brit. Med. Journ._, March 3, 1894.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of Visual Field.]\r\n\r\nC. F. W., aged 38, consulted Mr. Snell for his defective sight on April\r\n9, 1892. He had been a mixer at a factory for the manufacture of\r\nexplosives. He was jaundiced, the conjunctiva yellow, and the lips blue.\r\nHe was short of breath, and after the day’s work experienced aching of\r\nthe forearms and legs and tingling of the fingers. The urine was black\r\nin colour, of sp. gr. 1024; it was examined spectroscopically by Mr.\r\nMacMunn, who reported the black colour as due neither to indican, nor to\r\nblood, nor bile, but to be caused by some pigment belonging to the\r\naromatic series. The patient’s sight had been failing since the previous\r\nChristmas. Vision in the right eye was 6/24, left 6/36, both optic\r\npapillæ were somewhat pale. In each eye there was a central scotoma for\r\nred, and contraction of the field (see diagram). The man gradually gave\r\nup the work, and ultimately seems to have recovered. It is, however,\r\ninteresting to note that, after having left the work for some weeks, he\r\nwent back for a single day to the “mixing,” and was taken very ill,\r\nbeing insensible and delirious for five hours.\r\n\r\n§ 249. =The Blood in Nitro-benzol Poisoning.=--The effect on the blood\r\nhas been specially studied by Huber.[231] The blood of rabbits poisoned\r\nby dinitro-benzol is of a dark chocolate colour, and the microscope\r\nshows destruction of the red corpuscles; the amount of destruction may\r\nbe gathered from the following:--the blood corpuscles of a rabbit before\r\nthe experiment numbered 5,588,000 per cubic centimetre; a day after the\r\nexperiment 4,856,000; a day later 1,004,000; on the third day the rabbit\r\ndied.\r\n\r\n[231] _Op. cit._\r\n\r\nIn one rabbit, although the corpuscles sank to 1,416,000, yet recovery\r\ntook place.\r\n\r\nDr. MacMunn[232] has examined specimens of blood from two of Mr. Snell’s\r\npatients; he found a distinct departure from the normal; the red\r\ncorpuscles were smaller than usual, about 5 or 6 µ in diameter, and the\r\nappearances were like those seen in pernicious anæmia. Huber, in some of\r\nhis experiments on animals, found a spectroscopic change in the blood,\r\nviz., certain absorption bands, one in the red between C and D, and two\r\nin the green between D and E; the action of reducing agents on this\r\ndinitro-benzol blood, as viewed in a spectroscope provided with a scale\r\nin which C = 48, D = 62, and E = 80·5, was as follows:--\r\n\r\n[232] _Op. cit._\r\n\r\n                                       Dinitro-Bands.\r\n                                 In Red.        In Green.\r\n                                               -----/\\-----\r\n                                  50-52        62-66  70-77\r\n  After NH₄SO₄,                   53-55        62-66  70-77\r\n    „   NH₃,                      54-58        60-65  70-77\r\n    „   NH₄SO₄ + NH₃,             52-55        60-65  70-77\r\n\r\nTaking the symptoms as a whole, there has been noted:--a blue colour of\r\nthe lips, not unfrequently extending over the whole face, and even the\r\nconjunctivæ have been of a marked blue colour, giving the sufferer a\r\nstrange livid appearance. In other cases there have been jaundice, the\r\nconjunctivæ and the skin generally being yellow, the lips blue.\r\nOccasionally gastric symptoms are present. Sleeplessness is common, and\r\nnot unfrequently there is some want of muscular co-ordination, and the\r\nman staggers as if drunk. In more than one case there has been noticed\r\nsudden delirium. There is in chronic cases always more or less anæmia,\r\nand the urine is remarkable in its colour, which ranges from a slightly\r\ndark hue up to positive blackness. In a large proportion of cases there\r\nis ophthalmic trouble, the characteristics of which (according to Mr.\r\nSnell) are “failure of sight, often to a considerable degree, in a more\r\nor less equal extent on the two sides; concentric attraction of visual\r\nfield with, in many cases, a central colour scotoma; enlargement of\r\nretinal vessels, especially the veins; some blurring, never extensive,\r\nof edges of disc, and a varying degree of pallor of its surface--the\r\ncondition of retinal vessels spoken of being observed in workers with\r\nthe dinitro-benzol, independently of complaints of defective sight.\r\nCessation of work leads to recovery.”\r\n\r\n§ 250. =Detection of Dinitro-benzol.=--Dinitro-benzol may be detected in\r\nurine, in blood, and in fluids generally, by the following\r\nprocess:--Place tinfoil in the fluid, and add hydrochloric acid to\r\nstrong acidity, after allowing the hydrogen to be developed for at least\r\nan hour, make the fluid alkaline by caustic soda, and extract with ether\r\nin a separating tube; any metaphenylene-diamine will be contained in the\r\nether; remove the ether into a flask, and distil it off; dissolve the\r\nresidue in a little water.\r\n\r\nAcidify a solution of sodium nitrite with dilute sulphuric acid; on\r\nadding the solution, if it contains metaphenylene-diamine, a yellow to\r\nred colour will be produced, from the formation of Bismarck brown\r\n(triamido-phenol).\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.--Hydrocyanic Acid.\r\n\r\n§ 251. =Hydrocyanic Acid= (=hydric cyanide=)--specific gravity of liquid\r\n0·7058 at 18° C., boiling-point 26·5° (80° F.), HCy = 27.--The anhydrous\r\nacid is not an article of commerce, and is only met with in the\r\nlaboratory. It is a colourless, transparent liquid, and so extremely\r\nvolatile that, if a drop fall on a glass plate, a portion of it freezes.\r\nIt has a very peculiar peach-blossom odour, and is intensely poisonous.\r\nIt reddens litmus freely and transiently, dissolves red oxide of mercury\r\nfreely, forms a white precipitate of argentic cyanide when treated with\r\nsilver nitrate, and responds to the other tests described hereafter.\r\n\r\n§ 252. =Medicinal Preparations of Prussic Acid.=--The B.P. acid is a\r\nwatery solution of prussic acid; its specific gravity should be 0·997,\r\nand it should contain 2 per cent. of the anhydrous acid, 2 per cent. is\r\nalso the amount specified in the pharmacopœias of Switzerland and\r\nNorway, and in that of Borussica (VI. ed.); the latter ordains, however,\r\na spirituous solution, and the Norwegian an addition of 1 per cent. of\r\nconcentrated sulphuric acid. The French prussic acid is ordered to be\r\nprepared of a strength equalling 10 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe adulterations or impurities of prussic acid are hydrochloric,\r\nsulphuric,[233] and formic acids. Traces of silver may be found in the\r\nFrench acid, which is prepared from cyanide of silver. Tartaric acid is\r\nalso occasionally present. Hydrochloric acid is most readily detected by\r\nneutralising with ammonia, and evaporating to dryness in a water-bath;\r\nthe ammonium cyanide decomposes and volatilises, leaving as a saline\r\nresidue chloride of ammonium. This may easily be identified by the\r\nprecipitate of chloride of silver, which its solution gives on testing\r\nwith silver nitrate, and the deep brown precipitate with Nessler\r\nsolution. Sulphuric acid is, of course, detected by chloride of barium;\r\nformic acid by boiling a small quantity with a little mercuric oxide; if\r\npresent, the oxide will be reduced, and metallic mercury fall as a grey\r\nprecipitate. Silver, tartaric acid, and any other fixed impurities are\r\ndetected by evaporating the acid to dryness, and examining any residue\r\nwhich may be left. It may be well to give the various strengths of the\r\nacids of commerce in a tabular form:--\r\n\r\n[233] A trace of sulphuric or hydrochloric acid should not be called an\r\n_adulteration_, for it greatly assists the preservation, and therefore\r\nmakes the acid of greater therapeutic efficiency.\r\n\r\n                                                            Per cent.\r\n\r\n  British Pharmacopœia, Switzerland, and Bor.

There is an officinal\r\npreparation obtained by digesting cherry-laurel leaves in water, and\r\nthen distilling a certain portion over. This _Aqua Lauro-cerasi_ belongs\r\nto the old school of pharmacy, and is of uncertain strength, but varies\r\nfrom ·7 to 1 per cent. of HCN.\r\n\r\n§ 253. =Poisoning by Prussic Acid.=--Irrespective of suicidal or\r\ncriminal poisoning, accidents from prussic acid may occur--\r\n\r\n1. From the use of the cyanides in the arts.\r\n\r\n2. From the somewhat extensive distribution of the acid, or rather of\r\nprussic-acid producing substances in the vegetable kingdom.\r\n\r\n1. =In the Arts.=--The galvanic silvering[235] and gilding of metals,\r\nphotography, the colouring of black silks, the manufacture of Berlin\r\nblue, the dyeing of woollen cloth, and in a few other manufacturing\r\nprocesses, the alkaline cyanides are used, and not unfrequently fumes of\r\nprussic acid developed.\r\n\r\n[235] The preparation used for the silvering of copper vessels is a\r\nsolution of cyanide of silver in potassic cyanide, to which is added\r\nfinely powdered chalk. Manipulations with this fluid easily develop\r\nhydrocyanic acid fumes, which, in one case related by Martin (_Aerztl.\r\nIntelligenzbl._, p. 135, 1872), were powerful enough to produce symptoms\r\nof poisoning.\r\n\r\n2. =In the Animal Kingdom.=--One of the myriapods (_Chilognathen_)\r\ncontains glands at the roots of the hairs, which secrete prussic acid;\r\nwhen the insect is seized, the poisonous secretion is poured out from\r\nthe so-called _foramina repugnatoria_.\r\n\r\n3. =In the Vegetable Kingdom.=--A few plants contain cyanides, and many\r\ncontain amygdalin, or bodies formed on the type of amygdalin. In the\r\npresence of emulsin (or similar principles) and water, this breaks up\r\ninto prussic acid and other compounds--an interesting reaction usually\r\nrepresented thus--\r\n\r\n  C₂₀H₂₇NO₁₁ + 2H₂O = CNH + C₇H₆O + 2C₆H₁₂O₆.\r\n\r\n1 equivalent of amygdalin--_i.e._, 457 parts--yielding 1 equivalent of\r\nCNH or 27 parts; in other words, 100 parts of amygdalin yield\r\ntheoretically 5·909 parts of prussic acid,[236] so that, the amount of\r\neither being known, the other can be calculated from it.\r\n\r\n[236] According to Liebig and Wöhler, 17 grms. of amygdalin yield 1 of\r\nprussic acid (_i.e._, 5·7 per cent.) and 8 of oil of bitter almonds.\r\nThirty-four parts of amygdalin, mixed with 66 of emulsin of almonds,\r\ngive a fluid equalling the strength of acid of most pharmacopœias, viz.,\r\n2 per cent.\r\n\r\nGreshoff[237] has discovered an amygdalin-like glucoside in the two\r\ntropical trees _Pygeum parriflorum_ and _P. latifolium_. The same author\r\nstates that the leaves of _Gymnema latifolium_, one of the Asclepiads,\r\nyields to distillation benzaldehyde hydrocyanide. Both _Lasia_ and\r\n_Cyrtosperma_, plants belonging to the natural family of the Orontads,\r\ncontain in their flowers potassic cyanide. _Pangium edule_, according to\r\nGreshoff, contains so much potassic cyanide that he was able to prepare\r\na considerable quantity of that salt from one sample of the plant. An\r\nIndian plant (_Hydnocarpus inebrians_) also contains a cyanide, and has\r\nbeen used for the purpose of destroying fish. Among the Tiliads,\r\nGreshoff found that _Echinocarpus Sigun_ yielded hydrocyanic acid on\r\ndistillation. Even the common linseed contains a glucoside which breaks\r\nup into sugar, prussic acid, and a ketone.\r\n\r\n[237] M. Greshoff--_Erster Bericht über die Untersuchung von\r\nPflanzenstoffen Niederländisch-Indiens. Mittheilungen aus dem\r\nchemisch-pharmakologischen Laboratorium des botan. Gartens des Staates_,\r\nvii., Batavia, 1890, Niederländisch. Dr. Greshoff’s research indicates\r\nthat there are several other cyanide-yielding plants than those\r\nmentioned in the text.\r\n\r\nThe following plants, with many others, all yield, by appropriate\r\ntreatment, more or less prussic acid:--Bitter almonds (_Amygdalus\r\ncommunis_); the _Amygdalus persica_; the cherry laurel (_Prunus\r\nlaurocerasus_); the kernels of the plum (_Prunus domestica_); the bark,\r\nleaves, flowers, and fruit of the wild service-tree (_Prunus padus_);\r\nthe kernels of the common cherry and the apple; the leaves of the\r\n_Prunus capricida_; the bark of the _Pr. virginiana_; the flowers and\r\nkernels of the _Pr. spinosa_; the leaves of the _Cerasus acida_; the\r\nbark and almost all parts of the _Sorbus aucuparia_, _S. hybrida_, and\r\n_S. torminalis_; the young twigs of the _Cratægus oxyacantha_; the\r\nleaves and partly also the flowers of the shrubby _Spiræaceæ_, such as\r\n_Spiræa aruncus_, _S. sorbifolia_, and _S. japonica_;[238] together with\r\nthe roots of the bitter and sweet _Cassava_.\r\n\r\n[238] The bark and green parts of the _Prunus avium_, L., _Prunus\r\nmahaleb_, L., and herbaceous _Spirææ_ yield no prussic acid.\r\n\r\nIn only a few of these, however, has the exact amount of either prussic\r\nacid or amygdalin been determined; 1 grm. of bitter almond pulp is about\r\nequal to 2½ mgrms. of anhydrous prussic acid. The kernels from the\r\nstones of the cherry, according to Geiseler, yield 3 per cent. of\r\namygdalin; therefore, 1 grm. equals 1·7 mgrm. of HCN.\r\n\r\n§ 254. The wild service-tree (_Prunus padus_) and the cherry-laurel\r\n(_Prunus Laurocerasus_) contain, not amygdalin but a compound of\r\namygdalin with amygdalic acid; to this has been given the name of\r\nlaurocerasin. It was formerly known as amorphous amygdalin; its formula\r\nis C₄₀H₅₅NO₂₄; 933 parts are equivalent to 27 of hydric cyanide--that\r\nis, 100 parts equal to 2·89.\r\n\r\nIn the bark of the service-tree, Lehmann found ·7 per cent. of\r\nlaurocerasin (= ·02 HCN), and in the leaves of the cherry-laurel 1·38\r\nper cent. (= 0·39 HCN).\r\n\r\nFrancis,[239] in a research on the prussic acid in cassava root, gives\r\nas the mean in the sweet cassava ·0168 per cent., in the bitter ·0275\r\nper cent., the maximum in each being respectively ·0238 per cent., and\r\n·0442 per cent. The bitter-fresh cassava root has long been known as a\r\nvery dangerous poison; but the sweet has hitherto been considered\r\nharmless, although it is evident that it also contains a considerable\r\nquantity of prussic acid.\r\n\r\n[239] “On Prussic Acid from Cassava,” _Analyst_, April 1877, p. 5.\r\n\r\nThe kernels of the peach contain about 2·85 per cent. amygdalin (= ·17\r\nHCN); those of the plum ·96 per cent. (= ·056 HCN); and apple pips ·6\r\nper cent. (= ·035 per cent. HCN).\r\n\r\nIt is of great practical value to know, even approximately, the quantity\r\nof prussic acid contained in various fruits, since it has been adopted\r\nas a defence in criminal cases that the deceased was poisoned by prussic\r\nacid developed in substances eaten.\r\n\r\n§ 255. =Statistics.=--Poisoning by the cyanides (prussic acid or\r\ncyanide of potassium) occupies the third place among poisons in order\r\nof frequency in this country, and accounts for about 40 deaths annually.\r\n\r\nIn the ten years ending 1892 there were recorded no less than 395 cases\r\nof accidental, suicidal, or homicidal poisoning by prussic acid and\r\npotassic cyanide. The further statistical details may be gathered from\r\nthe following tables:--\r\n\r\nDEATHS IN ENGLAND AND WALES DURING THE TEN YEARS 1883-1892 FROM PRUSSIC\r\nACID AND POTASSIC CYANIDE.\r\n\r\n           PRUSSIC ACID (ACCIDENT OR NEGLIGENCE).\r\n\r\n  Ages,       0-1  1-5  5-15  15-25  25-65  65 and  Total\r\n                                            above\r\n  Males,      ...    1    1      1     12      1      16\r\n  Females,      1    1  ...      2      7    ...      11\r\n             --------------------------------------------\r\n  Totals,       1    2    1      3     19      1      27\r\n             --------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n       CYANIDE OF POTASSIUM (ACCIDENT OR NEGLIGENCE).\r\n\r\n  Ages,            1-5  5-15  15-25  25-65  65 and  Total\r\n                                            above\r\n  Males,             1    1      4      1    ...       7\r\n  Females,           1  ...    ...      3    ...       4\r\n                  ---------------------------------------\r\n  Totals,            2    1      4      4    ...      11\r\n                  ---------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                   PRUSSIC ACID (SUICIDE).\r\n\r\n  Ages,                       15-25  25-65  65 and  Total\r\n                                            above\r\n  Males,                        23    156     23     202\r\n  Females,                       5     13      1      19\r\n                             ----------------------------\r\n  Totals,                       28    169     24     221\r\n                             ----------------------------\r\n\r\n                  POTASSIUM CYANIDE (SUICIDE).\r\n\r\n  Ages,                 5-15  15-25  25-65  65 and  Total\r\n                                            above\r\n  Males,                  1      6     88      5     100\r\n  Females,              ...      6     15      1      22\r\n                       ----------------------------------\r\n  Totals,                 1     12    103      6     122\r\n                       ----------------------------------\r\n\r\nTo these figures must be added 10 cases of murder (2 males and 8\r\nfemales) by prussic acid, and 4 cases of murder (3 males and 1 female)\r\nby potassic cyanide.\r\n\r\nIn order to ascertain the proportion in which the various forms of\r\ncommercial cyanides cause death, and also the proportion of accidental,\r\nsuicidal, and criminal deaths from the same cause, Falck collated twelve\r\nyears of statistics from medical literature with the following result:--\r\n\r\nIn 51 cases of cyanide poisoning, 29 were caused by potassic cyanide, 9\r\nby hydric cyanide, 5 by oil of bitter almonds, 3 by peach stones (these\r\n3 were children, and are classed as “domestic,” that is, taking the\r\nkernels as a food), 3 by bitter almonds (1 of the 3 suicidal and\r\nfollowed by death, the other 2 “domestic”), 1 by tartaric acid and\r\npotassic cyanide (a suicidal case, an apothecary), and 1 by\r\nferro-cyanide of potassium and tartaric acid. Of the 43 cases first\r\nmentioned, 21 were suicidal, 7 criminal, 8 domestic, and 7 medicinal;\r\nthe 43 patients were 24 men, 14 children, and 5 women.\r\n\r\nThe cyanides are very rarely used for the purpose of murder: a poison\r\nwhich has a strong smell and a perceptible taste, and which also kills\r\nwith a rapidity only equalled by deadly bullet or knife-wounds, betrays\r\nits presence with too many circumstances of a tragic character to find\r\nfavour in the dark and secret schemes of those who desire to take life\r\nby poison. In 793 poisoning cases of a criminal character in France, 4\r\nonly were by the cyanides.\r\n\r\nHydric and potassic cyanides were once the favourite means of\r\nself-destruction employed by suicidal photographers, chemists,\r\nscientific medical men, and others in positions where such means are\r\nalways at hand; but, of late years, the popular knowledge of poisons has\r\nincreased, and self-poisoning by the cyanides scarcely belongs to a\r\nparticular class. A fair proportion of the deaths are also due to\r\naccident or unfortunate mistakes, and a still smaller number to the\r\nimmoderate or improper use of cyanide-containing vegetable products.\r\n\r\n§ 256. =Accidental and Criminal Poisoning by Prussic Acid.=--The poison\r\nis almost always taken by the mouth into the stomach, but occasionally\r\nin other ways--such, for example, as in the case of the illustrious\r\nchemist, Scheele, who died from inhalation of the vapour of the acid\r\nwhich he himself discovered, owing to the breaking of a flask. There is\r\nalso the case related by Tardieu, in which cyanide of potassium was\r\nintroduced under the nails; and that mentioned by Carrière,[240] in\r\nwhich a woman gave herself, with suicidal intent, an enema containing\r\ncyanide of potassium. It has been shown by experiments, in which every\r\ncare was taken to render it impossible for the fumes to be inhaled, that\r\nhydrocyanic acid applied to the eye of warm-blooded animals may destroy\r\nlife in a few minutes.[241]\r\n\r\n[240] “_Empoisonnement par le cyanure de potassium,--guérison_,”\r\n_Bullet. général de Thérap._, 1869, No. 30.\r\n\r\n[241] N. Gréhant, _Compt. rend. Soc. Biol._ [9], xi. 64, 65.\r\n\r\nWith regard to errors in dispensing, the most tragic case on record is\r\nthat related by Arnold:[242]--A pharmaceutist had put in a mixture for a\r\nchild potassic cyanide instead of potassic chlorate, and the child died\r\nafter the first dose: the chemist, however, convinced that he had made\r\nno mistake, to show the harmlessness of the preparation, drank some of\r\nit, and there and then died; while Dr. Arnold himself, incautiously\r\ntasting the draught, fell insensible, and was unconscious for six hours.\r\n\r\n[242] Arnold, A. B., “Case of Poisoning by the Cyanide of Potassium,”\r\n_Amer. Journ. of Med. Scien._, 1869.\r\n\r\n§ 257. =Fatal Dose.=--Notwithstanding the great number of persons who in\r\nevery civilised country fall victims to the cyanides, it is yet somewhat\r\ndoubtful what is the minimum dose likely to kill an adult healthy man.\r\nThe explanation of this uncertainty is to be sought mainly in the\r\nvarying strength of commercial prussic acid, which varies from 1·5\r\n(Schraeder’s) to 50 per cent. (Robiquet’s), and also in the varying\r\ncondition of the person taking the poison, more especially whether the\r\nstomach be full or empty. In by far the greater number, the dose taken\r\nhas been much beyond that necessary to produce death, but this\r\nobservation is true of most poisonings.\r\n\r\nThe dictum of Taylor, that a quantity of commercial prussic acid,\r\nequivalent to 1 English grain (65 mgrm.) of the anhydrous acid, would,\r\nunder ordinary circumstances, be sufficient to destroy adult life, has\r\nbeen generally accepted by all toxicologists. The minimum lethal dose of\r\npotassic cyanide is similarly put at 2·41 grains (·157 grm.). As to\r\nbitter almonds, if it be considered that as a mean they contain 2·5 per\r\ncent. of amygdalin, then it would take 45 grms., or about 80 almonds, to\r\nproduce a lethal dose for an adult; with children less--in fact, 4 to 6\r\nbitter almonds are said to have produced poisoning in a child.\r\n\r\n§ 258. =Action of Hydric and Potassic Cyanides on Living\r\nOrganisms.=--Both hydric cyanide and potassic cyanide are poisonous to\r\nall living forms, vegetable or animal, with the exception of certain\r\nfungi. The cold-blooded animals take a larger relative dose than the\r\nwarm-blooded, and the mammalia are somewhat more sensitive to the\r\npoisonous action of the cyanides than birds; but all are destroyed in a\r\nvery similar manner, and without any essential difference of action. The\r\nsymptoms produced by hydric and potassic cyanide are identical, and, as\r\nregards general symptoms, what is true as to the one is also true as to\r\nthe other. There is, however, one important difference in the action of\r\nthese two substances, if the mere local action is considered, for\r\npotassic cyanide is very alkaline, possessing even caustic properties. I\r\nhave seen, _e.g._, the gastric mucous membrane of a woman, who had taken\r\nan excessive dose of potassic cyanide on an empty stomach, so inflamed\r\nand swollen, that its state was similar to that induced by a moderate\r\nquantity of solution of potash. On the other hand, the acid properties\r\nof hydric cyanide are very feeble, and its effect on mucous membranes or\r\nthe skin in no way resembles that of the mineral acids.\r\n\r\nIt attacks the animal system in two ways: the one, a profound\r\ninterference with the ordinary metabolic changes; the other, a paralysis\r\nof the nervous centres. Schönbein discovered that it affected the blood\r\ncorpuscles in a peculiar way; normal blood decomposes with great ease\r\nhydrogen peroxide into oxygen and water. If to normal venous blood a\r\nlittle peroxide of hydrogen be added, the blood at once becomes bright\r\nred; but if a trace of prussic acid be present, it is of a dark brown\r\ncolour. The blood corpuscles, therefore, lose their power of conveying\r\noxygen to all parts of the system, and the phenomena of asphyxia are\r\nproduced. Geppert[243] has proved that this is really the case by\r\nshowing, in a series of researches, that, under the action of hydric\r\ncyanide, less oxygen is taken up, and less carbon dioxide formed than\r\nnormal, even if the percentage of oxygen in the atmosphere breathed is\r\nartificially increased. The deficiency of oxygen is in part due to the\r\nfact that substances like lactic acid, the products of incomplete\r\ncombustion, are formed instead of CO₂.\r\n\r\n[243] Geppert, _Ueber das Wesen der CNH-Vergift; mit einer Tafel_,\r\nBerlin, 1889; _Sep.-Abdr. aus Ztschr. f. klin. Med._, Bd. xv.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the protoplasm of the tissues is paralysed, and unable\r\nto take up the loosely bound oxygen presented. This explains a striking\r\nsymptom which has been noticed by many observers, that is, if\r\nhydrocyanic acid be injected into an animal, the venous blood becomes of\r\na bright red colour; in warm-blooded animals this bright colour is\r\ntransitory, but in cold-blooded animals, in which the oxidation process\r\nis slower, the blood remains bright red.\r\n\r\n§ 259. =Symptoms observed in Animals.=--The main differences between the\r\nsymptoms induced in cold-blooded and warm-blooded animals, by a fatal\r\ndose of hydric cyanide, are as follows:--\r\n\r\nThe respiration in frogs is at first somewhat dyspnœic, then much\r\nslowed, and at length it ceases. The heart, at first slowed, later\r\ncontracts irregularly, and at length gradually stops; but it may\r\ncontinue to beat for several minutes after the respiration has ceased.\r\nBut all these progressive symptoms are without convulsion. Among\r\nwarm-blooded animals, on the contrary, convulsions are constant, and the\r\nsequence of the symptoms appears to be--dyspnœa, slowing of the pulse,\r\ngiddiness, falling down, then convulsions with expulsion of the urine\r\nand fæces; dilatation of the pupils, exophthalmus, and finally cessation\r\nof the pulse and breathing. The convulsions also frequently pass into\r\ngeneral paralysis, with loss of reflex movements, weak, infrequent\r\nbreathing, irregular, quick, and very frequent pulse, and considerable\r\ndiminution of temperature.\r\n\r\nThe commencement of the symptoms in animals is extremely rapid, the\r\nrapidity varying according to the dose and the concentration of the\r\nacid. It was formerly thought that the death from a large dose of the\r\nconcentrated acid followed far more quickly than could be accounted for\r\nby the blood carrying the poison to the nervous centres; but Blake was\r\namong the first to point out that this doubt was not supported by facts\r\ncarefully observed, since there is always a sufficient interval between\r\nthe entry of the poison into the body and the first symptoms, to support\r\nthe theory that the poison is absorbed in the usual manner. Even when\r\nPreyer injected a cubic centimetre of 60 per cent. acid into the jugular\r\nvein of a rabbit, twenty-nine seconds elapsed before the symptoms\r\ncommenced. Besides, we have direct experiments showing that the\r\nacid--when applied to wounds in limbs, the vessels of which are tied,\r\nwhile the free nervous communication is left open--only acts when the\r\nligature is removed. Magendie describes, in his usual graphic manner,\r\nhow he killed a dog by injecting into the jugular vein prussic acid, and\r\n“_the dog died instantly, as if struck by a cannon ball_,” but it is\r\nprobable that the interval of time was not accurately noted. A few\r\nseconds pass very rapidly, and might be occupied even by slowly pressing\r\nthe piston of the syringe down, and in the absence of accurate\r\nmeasurements, it is surprising how comparatively long intervals of time\r\nare unconsciously shortened by the mind. In any case, this observation\r\nby Magendie has not been confirmed by the accurate tests of the more\r\nrecent experimenters; and it is universally acknowledged that, although\r\nwith strong doses of hydric cyanide injected into the circulation--or,\r\nin other words, introduced into the system--in the most favourable\r\nconditions for its speediest action, death occurs with appalling\r\nsuddenness, yet that it takes a time sufficiently long to admit of\r\nexplanation in the manner suggested. This has forensic importance, which\r\nwill be again alluded to. Experiments on animals show that a large dose\r\nof a dilute acid kills quite as quickly as an equivalent dose of a\r\nstronger acid, and in some cases it even seems to act more rapidly. If\r\nthe death does not take place within a few minutes, life may be\r\nprolonged for hours, and even, in rare cases, days, and yet the result\r\nbe death. Coullon poisoned a dog with prussic acid; it lived for\r\nnineteen days, and then died; but this is quite an exceptional case, and\r\nwhen the fatal issue is prolonged beyond an hour, the chance of recovery\r\nis considerable.\r\n\r\n§ 260. The length of time dogs poisoned by fatal doses survive,\r\ngenerally varies from two to fifteen minutes. The symptoms are\r\nconvulsions, insensibility of the cornea, cessation of respiration, and,\r\nfinally, the heart stops--the heart continuing to beat several minutes\r\nafter the cessation of the respirations.[244] When the dose is short of\r\na fatal one, the symptoms are as follows:--Evident giddiness and\r\ndistress; the tongue is protruded, the breath is taken in short, hurried\r\ngasps, there is salivation, and convulsions rapidly set in, preceded, it\r\nmay be, by a cry. The convulsions pass into paralysis and insensibility.\r\nAfter remaining in this state some time, the animal again wakes up, as\r\nit were, very often howls, and is again convulsed; finally, it sinks\r\ninto a deep sleep, and wakes up well.\r\n\r\n[244] N. Gréhant, _Compt. rend._, t. 109, pp. 502, 503.\r\n\r\nPreyer noticed a striking difference in the symptoms after section of\r\nthe vagus in animals, which varied according to whether the poison was\r\nadministered by the lungs, or subcutaneously. In the first case, if the\r\ndose is small, the respirations are diminished in frequency; then this\r\nis followed by normal breathing; if the dose is larger, there is an\r\nincrease in the frequency of the respirations. Lastly, if a very large\r\nquantity is introduced into the lungs, death quickly follows, with\r\nrespirations diminished in frequency. On the other hand, when the poison\r\nis injected subcutaneously, small doses have no influence on the\r\nbreathing; but with large doses, there is an increase in the frequency\r\nof the respirations, which sink again below the normal standard.\r\n\r\n§ 261. =Symptoms in Man.=--When a fatal but not excessive dose of either\r\npotassic or hydric cyanide is taken, the sequence of symptoms is as\r\nfollows:--Salivation, with a feeling of constriction in the throat,\r\nnausea, and occasionally vomiting. After a few minutes a peculiar\r\nconstricting pain in the chest is felt, and the breathing is distinctly\r\naffected. Giddiness and confusion of sight rapidly set in, and the\r\nperson falls to the ground in convulsions similar to those of epilepsy.\r\nThe convulsions are either general, or attacking only certain groups of\r\nmuscles; there is often true trismus, and the jaws are so firmly closed\r\nthat nothing will part them. The respiration is peculiar, the\r\ninspiration is short, the expiration prolonged,[245] and between the two\r\nthere is a long interval ever becoming more protracted as death is\r\nimminent. The skin is pale, or blue, or greyish-blue; the eyes are\r\nglassy and staring, with dilated pupils; the mouth is covered with foam,\r\nand the breath smells of the poison; the pulse, at first quick and\r\nsmall, sinks in a little while in frequency, and at length cannot be\r\nfelt. Involuntary evacuation of fæces, urine, and semen is often\r\nobserved, and occasionally there has been vomiting, and a portion of the\r\nvomit has been aspirated into the air-passages. Finally, the convulsions\r\npass into paralysis, abolition of reflex sensibility, and gradual\r\nceasing of the respiration. With large doses these different stages may\r\noccur, but the course is so rapid that they are merged the one into the\r\nother, and are undistinguishable. The shortest time between the taking\r\nof the acid and the commencement of the symptoms may be put at about ten\r\nseconds. If, however, a large amount of the vapour is inhaled at once,\r\nthis period may be rather lessened. The interval of time is so short\r\nthat any witnesses generally unintentionally exaggerate, and aver that\r\nthe effects were witnessed _before_ the swallowing of the liquid--“As\r\nthe cup was at his lips”--“He had hardly drunk it,” &c. There is\r\nprobably a short interval of consciousness, then come giddiness, and, it\r\nmay be, a cry for assistance; and lastly, there is a falling down in\r\nconvulsions, and a speedy death. Convulsions are not always present, the\r\nvictim occasionally appears to sink lifeless at once. Thus, in a case\r\nrelated by Hufeland, a man was seen to swallow a quantity of acid,\r\nequivalent to 40 grains of the pure acid--that is, about forty times\r\nmore than sufficient to kill him. He staggered a few paces, and then\r\nfell dead, without sound or convulsion.\r\n\r\n[245] In a case quoted by Seidel (Maschka’s _Handbuch_, p. 321), a man,\r\n36 years of age, four or five minutes after swallowing 150 mgrms.\r\nanhydrous HCN in spirits, lay apparently lifeless, without pulse or\r\nbreathing. After a few minutes was noticed an extraordinary deep\r\nexpiration, by which the ribs were drawn in almost to the spine, and the\r\nchest made quite hollow.\r\n\r\n§ 262. The very short interval that may thus intervene between the\r\ntaking of a dose of prussic acid and loss of consciousness, may be\r\nutilised by the sufferer in doing various acts, and thus this interval\r\nbecomes of immense medico-legal importance. The question is simply\r\nthis:--What can be done by a person in full possession of his faculties\r\nin ten seconds? I have found from experiment that, after drinking a\r\nliquid from a bottle, the bottle may be corked, the individual can get\r\ninto bed, and arrange the bedclothes in a suitable manner; he may also\r\nthrow the bottle away, or out of the window; and, indeed, with practice,\r\nin that short time a number of rapid and complicated acts may be\r\nperformed. This is borne out both by experiments on animals and by\r\nrecorded cases.\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Nunneley’s numerous experiments on dogs, one of the animals,\r\nafter taking poison, “went down three or four steps of the stairs, saw\r\nthat the door at the bottom was closed, and came back again.” A second\r\nwent down, came up, and went again down the steps of a long winding\r\nstaircase, and a third retained sufficient vigour to jump over another\r\ndog, and then leap across the top of a staircase.\r\n\r\nIn a remarkable case related by Dr. Guy,[246] in which a young man,\r\nafter drinking more wine than usual, was seized by a sudden impulse to\r\ntake prussic acid, and drank about 2 drachms, producing symptoms which,\r\nhad it not been for prompt treatment, would, in all probability, have\r\nended fatally--the interval is again noteworthy. After taking the poison\r\nin bed, he rose, walked round the foot of a chest of drawers, standing\r\nwithin a few yards of the bedside, placed the stopper firmly in the\r\nbottle, and then walked back to bed with the intention of getting into\r\nit; but here a giddiness seized him, and he sat down on the edge, and\r\nbecame insensible.\r\n\r\n[246] _Forensic Medicine_, 4th ed., p. 615.\r\n\r\nA case related by Taylor is still stronger. A woman, after swallowing a\r\nfatal dose of essence of almonds, went to a well in the yard, drew\r\nwater, and drank a considerable quantity. She then ascended two flights\r\nof stairs and called her child, again descended a flight of stairs, fell\r\non her bed, and died within half an hour from the taking of the poison.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, these cases and similar ones are exceptional, and only\r\nshow what is possible, not what is usual, the rule being that after\r\nfatal doses no voluntary act of significance--save, it may be, a cry\r\nfor assistance--is performed.[247]\r\n\r\n[247] Dr. J. Autal, a Hungarian chemist, states that cobalt nitrate is\r\nan efficacious antidote to poisoning by either HCN or KCN. The brief\r\ninterval between the taking of a fatal dose and death can, however, be\r\nrarely utilised.--_Lancet_, Jan. 16, 1894.\r\n\r\n§ 263. =Chronic poisoning by hydric cyanide= is said to occur among\r\nphotographers, gilders, and those who are engaged daily in the\r\npreparation or handling of either hydric or potassic cyanides. The\r\nsymptoms are those of feeble poisoning, headache, giddiness, noises in\r\nthe ears, difficult respiration, pain over the heart, a feeling of\r\nconstriction in the throat, loss of appetite, nausea, obstinate\r\nconstipation, full pulse, with pallor and offensive breath.\r\nKoritschoner[248] has made some observations on patients who were made\r\nto breathe at intervals, during many weeks, prussic acid vapour, with\r\nthe idea that such a treatment would destroy the tubercle bacilli.\r\nTwenty-five per cent. of those treated in this way suffered from redness\r\nof the pharynx, salivation, headache, nausea, vomiting, slow pulse, and\r\neven albuminuria.\r\n\r\n[248] _Wiener klin. Woch._, 1891.\r\n\r\n§ 264. =Post-mortem Appearances.=[249]--If we for the moment leave out\r\nof consideration any changes which may be seen in the stomach after\r\ndoses of potassic cyanide, then it may be affirmed that the pathological\r\nchanges produced by hydric and potassic cyanides mainly coincide with\r\nthose produced by suffocation. The most striking appearance is the\r\npresence of bright red spots; these bright red spots or patches are\r\nconfined to the surface of the body, the blood in the deeper parts being\r\nof the ordinary venous hue, unless, indeed, an enormous dose has been\r\ntaken; in that case the whole mass of blood may be bright red; this\r\nbright colour is due, according to Kobert, to the formation of\r\ncyanmethæmoglobin. The lungs and right heart are full of blood, and\r\nthere is a backward engorgement produced by the pulmonic block. The\r\nveins of the neck and the vessels of the head generally are full of\r\nblood, and, in like manner, the liver and kidneys are congested. In the\r\nmucous membrane of the bronchial tubes there is a bloody foam, the lungs\r\nare gorged, and often œdematous in portions; ecchymoses are seen in the\r\npleura and other serous membranes; and everywhere, unless concealed by\r\nputrefaction, or some strong-smelling ethereal oil, there is an odour of\r\nhydric cyanide.\r\n\r\n[249] Hydric cyanide has, according to C. Brame, a remarkable antiseptic\r\naction, and if administered in sufficient quantity to animals, preserves\r\nthem after death for a month. He considers that there is some more or\r\nless definite combination with the tissues.\r\n\r\nCasper has rightly recommended the head to be opened and examined first,\r\nso as to detect the odour, if present, in the brain. The abdominal and\r\nchest cavities usually possess a putrefactive smell, but the brain is\r\nlonger conserved, so that, if this course be adopted, there is a greater\r\nprobability of detecting the odour.\r\n\r\nThe stomach in poisoning by hydric cyanide is not inflamed, but if\r\nalcohol has been taken at the same time, or previously, there may be\r\nmore or less redness.\r\n\r\nIn poisoning by potassic cyanide, the appearances are mainly the same as\r\nthose just detailed, with, it may be, the addition of caustic local\r\naction. I have, however, seen, in the case of a gentleman who drank\r\naccidentally a considerable dose of potassic cyanide just after a full\r\nmeal, not the slightest trace of any redness, still less of corrosion.\r\nHere the contents of the stomach protected the mucous membrane, or\r\npossibly the larger amount of acid poured out during digestion\r\nsufficiently neutralised the alkali. Potassic cyanide, in very strong\r\nsolution, may cause erosions of the lips, and the caustic effect may be\r\ntraced in the mouth, throat, gullet, to the stomach and duodenum; but\r\nthis is unusual, and the local effects are, as a rule, confined to the\r\nstomach and duodenum. The mucous membrane is coloured blood-red, reacts\r\nstrongly alkaline,[250] is swollen, and it may be even ulcerated. The\r\nupper layers of the epithelium are also often dyed with the\r\ncolouring-matter of the blood, which has been dissolved out by the\r\ncyanide. This last change is a _post-mortem_ effect, and can be imitated\r\nby digesting the mucous membrane of a healthy stomach in a solution of\r\ncyanide. The intensity of these changes are, of course, entirely\r\ndependent on the dose and emptiness of the stomach. If the dose is so\r\nsmall as just to destroy life, there may be but little redness or\r\nswelling of the stomach, although empty at the time of taking the\r\npoison. In those cases in which there has been vomiting, and a part of\r\nthe vomit has been drawn into the air-passages, there may be also\r\ninflammatory changes in the larynx. If essence of almonds has been\r\nswallowed, the same slight inflammation may be seen which has been\r\nobserved with other essential oils, but no erosion, no strong alkaline\r\nreaction, nor anything approaching the effects of the caustic cyanide.\r\n\r\n[250] The following case came under my own observation:--A stout woman,\r\n35 years of age, the wife of a French polisher, drank, in a fit of rage,\r\na solution of cyanide of potassium. It was estimated that about 15\r\ngrains of the solid substance were swallowed. She died within an hour.\r\nThe face was flushed, the body not decomposed; the mouth smelt strongly\r\nof cyanide; the stomach had about an ounce of bloody fluid in it, and\r\nwas in a most intense state of congestion. There was commencing fatty\r\ndegeneration of the liver, the kidneys were flabby, and the capsule\r\nadherent. The contents of the stomach showed cyanide of potassium, and\r\nthe blood was very fluid. The woman was known to be of intemperate\r\nhabits.\r\n\r\nIn poisoning by bitter almonds no inflammatory change in the mucous\r\nmembrane of the coats of the stomach would be anticipated, yet in one\r\nrecorded case there seems to have been an eroded and inflamed patch.\r\n\r\n§ 265. =Tests for Hydrocyanic Acid and Cyanide of Potassium.=--(1.) The\r\naddition of silver nitrate to a solution containing prussic acid, or a\r\nsoluble cyanide,[251] produces a precipitate of argentic cyanide. 100\r\nparts of argentic cyanide are composed of 80·60 Ag and 19·4 CN,\r\nequivalent to 20·1 HCN. It is a white anhydrous precipitate, soluble\r\neither in ammonia or in a solution of cyanide of potassium. It is\r\nsoluble in hot dilute nitric acid, but separates on cooling. A particle\r\nof silver cyanide, moistened with strong ammonia, develops needles;\r\nsilver chloride treated similarly, octahedral crystals. It is insoluble\r\nin water. Upon ignition it is decomposed into CN and metallic silver,\r\nmixed with a little paracyanide of silver.\r\n\r\n[251] In the case of testing in this way for the alkaline cyanides, the\r\nsolution must contain a little free nitric acid.\r\n\r\nA very neat process for the identification of cyanide of silver is the\r\nfollowing:--Place the perfectly dry cyanide in a closed or sealed tube,\r\ncontaining a few crystals of iodine. On heating slightly, iodide of\r\ncyanogen is sublimed in beautiful needles. These crystals again may be\r\ndissolved in a dilute solution of potash, a little ferrous sulphate\r\nadded, and hydrochloric acid, and in this way Prussian blue produced. If\r\nthe quantity to be tested is small, the vapour of the acid may be\r\nevolved in a very short test-tube, the mouth of which is closed by the\r\nordinary thin discs of microscopic glass, the under surface of which is\r\nmoistened with a solution of nitrate of silver; the resulting crystals\r\nof silver cyanide are very characteristic, and readily identified by the\r\nmicroscope.\r\n\r\n(2.) If, instead of silver nitrate, the disc be moistened with a\r\nsolution of sulphate of iron (to which has been added a little potash),\r\nand exposed to the vapour a short time, and then some dilute\r\nhydrochloric acid added, the moistened surface first becomes yellow,\r\nthen green, lastly, and permanently, blue. No other blue compound of\r\niron (with the exception of Prussian blue) is insoluble in dilute\r\nhydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\n(3.) A third, and perhaps the most delicate of all, is the so-called\r\nsulphur test. A yellow sulphide of ammonium, containing free sulphur, is\r\nprepared by saturating ammonia by SH₂, first suspending in the fluid a\r\nlittle finely-precipitated sulphur (or an old, ill-preserved solution of\r\nsulphide of ammonium may be used). Two watch-glasses are now taken; in\r\nthe one the fluid containing prussic acid is put, and the second\r\n(previously moistened with the sulphide of ammonium described) is\r\ninverted over it. The glasses are conveniently placed for a few minutes\r\nin the water-oven; the upper one is then removed, the moist surface\r\nevaporated to dryness in the water-bath, a little water added, and then\r\na small drop of solution of chloride of iron. If hydrocyanic acid is\r\npresent, the sulphocyanide of iron will be formed of a striking\r\nblood-red colour.\r\n\r\n(4.) The reaction usually called Schönbein’s, or Pagenstecher and\r\nSchönbein’s[252] (but long known,[253] and used before the publication\r\nof their paper), consists of guaiacum paper, moistened with a very\r\ndilute solution of sulphate of copper (1 : 2000). This becomes blue if\r\nexposed to the vapour of hydrocyanic acid. Unfortunately, the same\r\nreaction is produced by ammonia, ozone, nitric acid, hypochlorous acid,\r\niodine, bromine, chromate of potash, and other oxidising agents, so that\r\nits usefulness is greatly restricted.\r\n\r\n[252] _Neues Repert. de Pharm._, 18, 356.\r\n\r\n[253] This reaction (with tincture of guaiacum and copper) has been long\r\nknown. “I remember a pharmaceutist, who attended my father’s laboratory,\r\nshowing me this test in 1828 or 1829.”--Mohr’s _Toxicologie_, p. 92.\r\n\r\n(5.) A very delicate test for prussic acid is as follows:--About\r\none-half centigrm. of ammonia, ferrous sulphate (or other pure ferrous\r\nsalt), and the same quantity of uranic nitrate, are dissolved in 50 c.c.\r\nof water, and 1 c.c. of this test-liquid is placed in a porcelain dish.\r\nOn now adding a drop of a liquid containing the smallest quantity of\r\nprussic acid, a grey-purple colour, or a distinct purple precipitate is\r\nproduced.[254]\r\n\r\n[254] M. Carey Lea, _Amer. Journ. of Science_ [3], ix. pp. 121-123; _J.\r\nC. Society_, 1876, vol. i. p. 112.\r\n\r\n(6.) A hot solution of potassic cyanide, mixed with picric acid, assumes\r\na blood-red colour, due to the formation of picro-cyanic acid. Free HCN\r\ndoes not give this reaction, and therefore must first be neutralised by\r\nan alkali.\r\n\r\n(7.) =Schönbein’s Test.=--To a few drops of defibrinated ox-blood are\r\nadded a few drops of the carefully-neutralised distillate supposed to\r\ncontain prussic acid, and then a little neutral peroxide of hydrogen is\r\nadded. If the distillate contains no prussic acid, then the mixture\r\nbecomes of a bright pure red and froths strongly; if, on the other hand,\r\na trace of prussic acid be present, the liquid becomes brown and does\r\nnot froth, or only slightly does so.\r\n\r\n(8.) =Kobert’s Test.=--A 1-4 per cent. solution of blood, to which a\r\ntrace of ferridcyanide of potassium is added, is prepared, and the\r\nneutralised distillate added to this solution. If hydric cyanide be\r\npresent, then the liquid becomes of a bright red colour, and, examined\r\nspectroscopically, instead of the spectrum of methæmoglobin, will be\r\nseen the spectrum of cyanmethæmoglobin. Kobert proposes to examine the\r\nblood of the poisoned, for the purpose of diagnosis, during life. A drop\r\nof blood from a healthy person, and a drop of blood from the patient,\r\nare examined side by side, according to the process just given.\r\n\r\n§ 266. =Separation of Hydric Cyanide or Potassic Cyanide from Organic\r\nMatters, such as the Contents of the Stomach, &c.=--It is very\r\nnecessary, before specially searching for hydric cyanide in the contents\r\nof the stomach, to be able to say, by careful and methodical\r\nexamination, whether there are or are not any fragments of bitter\r\nalmonds, of apples, peaches, or other substance likely to produce hydric\r\ncyanide. If potassic cyanide has been taken, simple distillation will\r\nalways reveal its presence, because it is found partly decomposed into\r\nhydric cyanide by the action of the gastric acids. Nevertheless, an acid\r\nshould always be added, and if, as in the routine process given at p.\r\n48, there is reasonable doubt for suspecting that there will be no\r\ncyanide present, it will be best to add tartaric acid (for this organic\r\nacid will in no way interfere with subsequent operations), and distil,\r\nas recommended, in a vacuum. If, however, from the odour and from the\r\nhistory of the case, it is pretty sure to be a case of poisoning by\r\nhydric or potassic cyanide, then the substances, if fluid, are at once\r\nplaced in a retort or flask, and acidified with a suitable quantity of\r\nsulphuric acid, or if the tissues or other solid matters are under\r\nexamination, they are finely divided, or pulped, and distilled, after\r\nacidifying with sulphuric acid as before. It may be well here, as a\r\ncaution, to remark that the analyst must not commit the unpardonable\r\nerror of first producing a cyanide by reagents acting on animal matters,\r\nand then detecting as a poison the cyanide thus manufactured. If, for\r\nexample, a healthy liver is carbonised by nitric acid, saturated with\r\npotash, and then burnt up, cyanide of potassium is always one of the\r\nproducts; and, indeed, the ashes of a great variety of nitrogenous\r\norganic substances may contain cyanides--cyanides not pre-existing, but\r\nmanufactured by combination. By the action of nitric acid even on\r\nsugar,[255] hydric cyanide is produced.\r\n\r\n[255] _Chemical News_, 68, p. 75.\r\n\r\nThe old method of distillation was to distil by the gentle heat of a\r\nwater-bath, receiving the distillate in a little weak potash water, and\r\nnot prolonging the process beyond a few hours. The experiments of\r\nSokoloff, however, throw a grave doubt on the suitability of this simple\r\nmethod for quantitative results.\r\n\r\nN. Sokoloff[256] recommends the animal substances to be treated by water\r\nstrongly acidified with hydric sulphate, and then to be distilled in the\r\nwater-bath for from two to three days; or to be distilled for\r\ntwenty-four hours, by the aid of an oil-bath, at a high temperature. He\r\ngives the following example of quantitative analysis by the old process\r\nof merely distilling for a few hours, and by the new:--\r\n\r\n[256] _Ber. d. deutsch. chem. Gesellsch._, Berlin, ix. p. 1023.\r\n\r\n=Old Process.=--(1.) Body of a hound--age, 2 years; weight, 5180 grms.;\r\ndose administered, 57 mgrms. HCN; death in fifteen minutes.

Sokoloff, we may\r\npoint out that a loss of half-a-dozen mgrms. only appears rather\r\nextraordinary.\r\n\r\nFrom another canine corpse, three days laid in an oven, and left for\r\ntwenty-seven days at the ordinary temperature, 5·1 mgrms. were recovered\r\nout of a fatal dose of 38 mgrms.\r\n\r\nThe estimation was in each case performed by titrating the distillate\r\nwith argentic nitrate, the sulphur compounds having been previously got\r\nrid of by saturating the distillate with KHO, and precipitating by lead\r\nacetate.\r\n\r\nVenturoli[258] has, on the contrary, got good quantitative results\r\nwithout distillation at all. A current of pure hydrogen gas is passed\r\nthrough the liquid to be tested and the gas finally made to bubble\r\nthrough silver nitrate. He states that the whole of the hydric cyanide\r\npresent is carried over in an hour. Metallic cyanides must be decomposed\r\nby sulphuric acid or tartaric acid. Mercury cyanide must be decomposed\r\nwith SH₂, the solution acidified with tartaric acid, neutralised with\r\nfreshly precipitated calcic carbonate to fix any ferro- or\r\nferri-cyanides present, and hydrogen passed in and the issuing gases led\r\nfirst through a solution of bismuth nitrate to remove SH₂ and then into\r\nthe silver solution.\r\n\r\n[258] L’Orosi. xv. 85-88.\r\n\r\n§ 267. =How long after Death can Hydric or Potassic Cyanides be\r\nDetected?=--Sokoloff appears to have separated prussic acid from the\r\nbody of hounds at very long periods after death--in one case sixty days.\r\nDragendorff recognised potassic cyanide in the stomach of a hound after\r\nit had been four weeks in his laboratory,[259] and in man eight days\r\nafter burial. Casper also, in his 211th case, states that more than 18\r\nmgrms. of anhydrous prussic acid were obtained from a corpse eight days\r\nafter death.[260] Dr. E. Tillner[261] has recognised potassic cyanide in\r\na corpse four months after death. Lastly, Struve[262] put 300 grms. of\r\nflesh, 400 of common water, and 2·378 of KCy in a flask, and then opened\r\nthe flask after 547 days. The detection was easy, and the estimation\r\nagreed with the amount placed there at first. So that, even in very\r\nadvanced stages of putrefaction, and at periods after death extending\r\nbeyond many months, the detection of prussic acid cannot be pronounced\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\n[259] Dragendorff, G., _Beitr. zur gericht. Chem._, p. 59.\r\n\r\n[260] Casper’s _Pract. Handbuch der gerichtlichen Medicin_, p. 561.\r\n\r\n[261] _Vierteljahr. f. gerichtl. Med._, Berlin, 1881, p. 193.\r\n\r\n[262] _Zeitschrift f. anal. Chemie_, von Fresenius, 1873, xii. p. 4.\r\n\r\n§ 268. =Estimation of Hydrocyanic Acid or Potassic Cyanide.=--In all\r\ncases, the readiest method of estimating prussic acid (whether it be in\r\nthe distillate from organic substances or in aqueous solution) is to\r\nsaturate it with soda or potash, and titrate the alkaline cyanide thus\r\nformed with nitrate of silver. The process is based on the fact that\r\nthere is first formed a soluble compound (KCy, AgCy), which the\r\nslightest excess of silver breaks up, and the insoluble cyanide is at\r\nonce precipitated. If grains are used, 17 grains of nitrate of silver\r\nare dissolved in water, the solution made up to exactly 1000 grain\r\nmeasures, each grain measure equalling ·0054 grain of anhydrous\r\nhydrocyanic acid. If grammes are employed, the strength of the nitrate\r\nof silver solution should be 1·7 grm. to the litre, each c.c. then =\r\n·0054 hydrocyanic acid, or ·01302 grm. of potassic cyanide.\r\n\r\nEssential oil of bitter almonds may also be titrated in this way,\r\nprovided it is diluted with sufficient spirit to prevent turbidity from\r\nseparation of the essential oil. If hydrocyanic acid is determined\r\ngravimetrically (which is sometimes convenient, when only a single\r\nestimation is to be made), it is precipitated as cyanide of silver, the\r\ncharacters of which have been already described.\r\n\r\n    § 269. =Case of Poisoning by Bitter Almonds.=--Instances of\r\n    poisoning by bitter almonds are very rare. The following interesting\r\n    case is recorded by Maschka:--\r\n\r\n    A maid-servant, 31 years of age, after a quarrel with her lover, ate\r\n    a quantity of bitter almonds. In a few minutes she sighed,\r\n    complained of being unwell and faint; she vomited twice, and, after\r\n    about ten minutes more had elapsed, fell senseless and was\r\n    convulsed. An hour afterwards, a physician found her insensible, the\r\n    eyes rolled upwards, the thumb clenched within the shut fists, and\r\n    the breathing rattling, the pulse very slow. She died within an\r\n    hour-and-a-half from the first symptoms.\r\n\r\n    The autopsy showed the organs generally healthy, but all, save the\r\n    liver, exhaling a faint smell of bitter almonds. The right side of\r\n    the heart was full of fluid dark blood, the left was empty. Both\r\n    lungs were rich in blood, which smelt of prussic acid. The stomach\r\n    was not inflamed--it held 250 grms. of a yellow fluid, containing\r\n    white flocks smelling of bitter almond oil. In the most dependent\r\n    portion of the stomach there was a swollen patch of mucous membrane,\r\n    partially denuded of epithelium. The mucous membrane of the duodenum\r\n    was also swollen and slightly red. The contents of the stomach were\r\n    acid, and yielded, on distillation, hydride of benzole and hydric\r\n    cyanide. Residues of the almonds themselves were also found, and\r\n    the whole quantity taken by the woman from various data was\r\n    calculated to be 1200 grains of bitter almonds, equal to 43 grains\r\n    of amygdalin, or 2·5 grains of pure hydric cyanide.\r\n\r\n\r\nPoisonous Cyanides other than Hydric and Potassic Cyanides.\r\n\r\n    § 270. The action of both _sodic and ammonic cyanides_ is precisely\r\n    similar to that of potassic cyanide. With regard to ammonic cyanide,\r\n    there are several experiments by Eulenberg,[263] showing that its\r\n    vapour is intensely poisonous.\r\n\r\n[263] _Gewerbe Hygiene_, p. 385.\r\n\r\n    A weak stream of ammonic cyanide vapour was passed into glass\r\n    shades, under which pigeons were confined. After a minute, symptoms\r\n    of distress commenced, then followed convulsions and speedy death.\r\n    The _post-mortem_ signs were similar to those produced by prussic\r\n    acid, and this substance was separated from the liver and lungs.\r\n\r\n    § 271. With regard to the _double cyanides_, all those are poisonous\r\n    from which hydric cyanide can be separated through dilute acids,\r\n    while those which, like potassic ferro-cyanide, do not admit of this\r\n    decomposition, may be often taken with impunity, and are only\r\n    poisonous under certain conditions.\r\n\r\n    Sonnenschein records the death of a colourist, after he had taken a\r\n    dose of potassic ferro-cyanide and then one of tartaric acid; and\r\n    Volz describes the death of a man, who took potassic ferro-cyanide\r\n    and afterwards equal parts of nitric and hydrochloric acids. In this\r\n    latter case, death took place within the hour, with all the symptoms\r\n    of poisoning by hydric cyanide; so that it is not entirely true, as\r\n    most text-books declare, that ferro-cyanide is in no degree\r\n    poisonous. Carbon dioxide will decompose potassic ferro-cyanide at\r\n    72°-74°, potass ferrous cyanide being precipitated--K₂Fe₂(CN)₆. A\r\n    similar action takes place if ferro-cyanide is mixed with a solution\r\n    of peptone and casein, and digested at blood heat[264] (from 37° to\r\n    40° C.), so that it is believed that when ferro-cyanide is swallowed\r\n    HCN is liberated, but the quantity is usually so small at any given\r\n    moment that no injury is caused: but there are conditions in which\r\n    it may kill speedily.[265]\r\n\r\n[264] Autenrieth, _Arch. Pharm._, 231, 99-109.\r\n\r\n[265] The presence of ferro-cyanide is easily detected. The liquid is,\r\nif necessary, filtered and then acidified with hydrochloric acid and a\r\nfew drops of ferric chloride added; if the liquid contains\r\nferro-cyanide, there is immediate production of Prussian blue. It may\r\nhappen that potassic or sodic cyanide has been taken as well as\r\nferro-cyanide, and it will be necessary then to devise a process by\r\nwhich only the prussic acid from the simple cyanide is distilled over.\r\nAccording to Autenrieth, if sodium hydrocarbonate is added to the liquid\r\nin sufficient quantity and the liquid distilled, the hydric cyanide that\r\ncomes over is derived wholly from the sodium or potassium cyanide.\r\nShould mercury cyanide and ferro-cyanide be taken together, then this\r\nprocess requires modification; bicarbonate of soda is added as before,\r\nand then a few c.c. of water saturated with hydric sulphide; under these\r\ncircumstances, only the hydric cyanide derived from the mercury cyanide\r\ndistils over. If the bicarbonate of soda is omitted, the distillate\r\ncontains hydric cyanide derived from the ferro-cyanide.\r\n\r\n    =Mercuric cyanide=, it has been often said, acts precisely like\r\n    mercuric chloride (corrosive sublimate), and a poisonous action is\r\n    attributed to it not traceable to cyanogen; but this is erroneous\r\n    teaching. Bernard[266] declares that it is decomposed by the gastric\r\n    juice, and hydric cyanide set free; while Pelikan puts it in the\r\n    same series as ammonic and potassic cyanides. Lastly,\r\n    Tolmatscheff,[267] by direct experiment, has found its action to\r\n    resemble closely that of hydric cyanide.[268]\r\n\r\n[266] _Substances Toxiques_, pp. 66-103.\r\n\r\n[267] “_Einige Bemerkungen über die Wirkung von Cyanquecksilber_,” in\r\nHoppe-Seyler’s _Med. Chem. Untersuchungen_, 2 Heft, p. 279.\r\n\r\n[268] Mercury cyanide may be detected in a liquid after acidifying with\r\ntartaric acid, and adding a few c.c. of SH₂ water and then distilling.\r\nS. Lopes suggests another process: the liquid is acidified with tartaric\r\nacid, ammonium chloride added in excess, and the liquid is distilled. A\r\ndouble chloride of ammonium and mercury is formed, and HCN distils over\r\nwith the steam.--_J. Pharm._, xxvii. 550-553.\r\n\r\n    =Silver cyanide= acts, according to the experiments of Nunneley,\r\n    also like hydric cyanide, but very much weaker.\r\n\r\n    =Hydric sulphocyanide= in very large doses is poisonous.\r\n\r\n    =Potassic sulphocyanide=, according to Dubreuil and Legros,[269] if\r\n    subcutaneously injected, causes first local paralysis of the\r\n    muscles, and later, convulsions.\r\n\r\n[269] _Compt. rend._, t. 64, 1867, p. 561.\r\n\r\n    =Cyanogen chloride= (CNCl) and also the compound (C₃N₃Cl₃)--the one\r\n    a liquid, boiling at 15°, the other a solid, which may be obtained\r\n    in crystals--are both poisonous, acting like hydric cyanide.\r\n\r\n    =Methyl cyanide= is a liquid obtained by distillation of a mixture\r\n    of calcic methyl sulphate and potassic cyanide. It boils at 77°, and\r\n    is intensely poisonous. Eulenberg[270] has made with this substance\r\n    several experiments on pigeons. An example of one will suffice:--A\r\n    young pigeon was placed under a glass shade, into which methyl\r\n    cyanide vapour, developed from calcic methyl sulphate and potassic\r\n    cyanide, was admitted. The pigeon immediately became restless, and\r\n    the fæces were expelled. In forty seconds it was slightly convulsed,\r\n    and was removed after a few minutes’ exposure. The pupils were then\r\n    observed not to be dilated, but the respiration had ceased; the legs\r\n    were feebly twitching; the heart still beat, but irregularly; a\r\n    turbid white fluid dropped out of the beak, and after six minutes\r\n    life was extinct.\r\n\r\n[270] _Gewerbe Hygiene_, p. 392.\r\n\r\n    The pathological appearances were as follows:--In the beak much\r\n    watery fluid; the membranes covering the brain weakly injected; the\r\n    _plexus venosus spinalis_ strongly injected; in the region of the\r\n    cervical vertebra a small extravasation between the dura mater and\r\n    the bone; the right lung of a clear cherry-red colour, and the left\r\n    lung partly of the same colour, the parenchyma presented the same\r\n    hue as the surface; on section of the lungs a whitish froth exuded\r\n    from the cut surface. In the cellular tissue of the trachea, there\r\n    were extravasations 5 mm. in diameter; the mucous membrane of the\r\n    air-passages was pale; the right ventricle and the left auricle of\r\n    the heart were filled with coagulated and fluid dark red blood;\r\n    liver and kidneys normal; the blood dark red and very fluid,\r\n    becoming bright cherry-red on exposure to the air; blood corpuscles\r\n    unchanged. Cyanogen was separated, and identified from the lungs and\r\n    the liver.\r\n\r\n    =Cyanuric acid= (C₃O₃N₃H₃), one of the decomposition products\r\n    obtained from urea, is poisonous, the symptoms and pathological\r\n    effects closely resembling those due to hydric cyanide. In\r\n    experiments on animals, there has been no difficulty in detecting\r\n    prussic acid in the lungs and liver after poisoning by cyanuric\r\n    acid.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.--Phosphorus.\r\n\r\n§ 272. =Phosphorus.=--Atomic weight 31, specific gravity 1·77 to 1·840.\r\nPhosphorus melts at from 44·4° to 44·5° to a pale yellow oily fluid. The\r\nboiling-point is about 290°.\r\n\r\nThe phosphorus of commerce is usually preserved under water in the form\r\nof waxy, semi-transparent sticks; if exposed to the air white fumes are\r\ngiven off, luminous in the dark, with a peculiar onion-like odour. On\r\nheating phosphorus it readily inflames, burning with a very white flame.\r\n\r\nAt 0° phosphorus is brittle; the same quality may be imparted to it by a\r\nmere trace of sulphur. Phosphorus may be obtained in dodecahedral\r\ncrystals by slowly cooling large melted masses. It may also be obtained\r\ncrystalline by evaporating a solution in bisulphide of carbon or hot\r\nnaphtha in a current of carbon dioxide. It is usually stated to be\r\nabsolutely insoluble in water, but Julius Hartmann[271] contests this,\r\nhaving found in some experiments that 100 grms. of water digested with\r\nphosphorus for sixty-four hours at 38·5° dissolved ·000127 grm. He also\r\ninvestigated the solvent action of bile, and found that 100 grms. of\r\nbile under the same conditions, dissolved ·02424 grm., and that the\r\nsolubility of phosphorus rose both in water and bile when the\r\ntemperature was increased. Phosphorus is somewhat soluble in alcohol and\r\nether, and also, to some extent, in fatty and ethereal oils; but the\r\nbest solvent is carbon disulphide.\r\n\r\n[271] _Zur acuten Phosphor-Vergiftung_, Dorpat, 1866.\r\n\r\nThe following is the order of solubility in certain menstrua, the\r\nfigures representing the number of parts by weight of the solvent\r\nrequired to dissolve 1 part of phosphorus:--\r\n\r\n  Carbon Disulphide,                      4\r\n  Almond Oil,                           100\r\n  Concentrated Acetic Acid,[272]        100\r\n  Ether,                                250\r\n  Alcohol, specific gravity ·822,       400\r\n  Glycerin,                             588\r\n\r\n[272] Phosphorus is very little soluble in cold acetic acid, and the\r\nsolubility given is only correct when the boiling acid acts for some\r\ntime on the phosphorus.\r\n\r\nPhosphorus exists in, or can be converted into, several allotropic\r\nmodifications, of which the red or amorphous phosphorus is the most\r\nimportant. This is effected by heating it for some time, in the absence\r\nof air, from 230° to 235°. It is not poisonous.[273] Commercial red\r\nphosphorus does, however, contain very small quantities of unchanged or\r\nordinary phosphorus--according to Fresenius, from ·6 per cent.\r\ndownwards; it also contains phosphorous acid, and about 4·6 per cent. of\r\nother impurities, among which is graphite.[274]\r\n\r\n[273] A hound took 200 grms. of red phosphorus in twelve days, and\r\nremained healthy.--Sonnenschein.\r\n\r\n[274] Schrotter, _Chem. News_, vol. xxxvi. p. 198.\r\n\r\n§ 273. =Phosphuretted Hydrogen.=--=Phosphine= (PH₃), mol. weight 34,\r\nspecific gravity 1·178, percentage composition, phosphorus 91·43,\r\nhydrogen 8·57 by weight. The absolutely pure gas is not spontaneously\r\ninflammable, but that made by the ordinary process is so. It is a\r\ncolourless, highly poisonous gas, which does not support combustion, but\r\nis itself combustible, burning to phosphoric acid (PH₃ + 2O₂ = PO₄H₃).\r\nExtremely dangerous explosive mixtures may be made by combining\r\nphosphine and air or oxygen. Phosphine, when quite dry, burns with a\r\nwhite flame, but if mixed with aqueous vapour, it is green; hence a\r\nhydrogen flame containing a mixture of PH₃ possesses a green colour.\r\n\r\nIf sulphur is heated in a stream of phosphine, hydric sulphide and\r\nsulphur phosphide are the products. Oxides of the metals, heated with\r\nphosphine, yield phosphides with formation of water. Iodine, warmed in\r\nphosphine, gives white crystals of iodine phosphonium, and biniodide of\r\nphosphorus, 5I + 4PH₃ = 3PIH₄ + PI₂. Chlorine inflames the gas, the\r\nfinal result being hydric chloride and chloride of phosphorus, PH₃ + 8Cl\r\n= 3ClH + PCl₅. One of the most important decompositions for our purpose\r\nis the action of phosphine on a solution of nitrate of silver; there is\r\na separation of metallic silver, and nitric and phosphoric acids are\r\nfound in solution, thus--8AgNO₃ + PH₃ + 4OH₂ = 8Ag + 8HNO₃ + PO₄H₃. This\r\nis, however, rather the end reaction; for, at first, there is a\r\nseparation of a black precipitate composed of phosphor-silver. The\r\nexcess of silver can be separated by hydric chloride, and the phosphoric\r\nacid made evident by the addition of molybdic acid in excess.\r\n\r\n§ 274. =The medicinal preparations of phosphorus= are not numerous; it\r\nis usually prescribed in the form of pills, made by manufacturers of\r\ncoated pills on a large scale. The pills are composed of phosphorus,\r\nbalsam of Tolu, yellow wax, and curd soap, and 3 grains equal 1/30 grain\r\nof phosphorus. There is also a _phosphorated oil_, containing about 1\r\npart of phosphorus in 100; that of the French Pharmacopœia is made with\r\n1 part of dried phosphorus dissolved in 50 parts of warm almond oil;\r\nthat of the German has 1 part in 80; the strength of the former is\r\ntherefore 2 per cent., of the latter 1·25 per cent. The medicinal dose\r\nof phosphorus is from 1/100 to 1/30 grain.\r\n\r\n§ 275. =Matches and Vermin Pastes.=--An acquaintance with the percentage\r\nof phosphorus in the different pastes and matches of commerce will be\r\nfound useful. Most of the vermin-destroying pastes contain from 1 to 2\r\nper cent. of phosphorus.\r\n\r\nA phosphorus paste that was fatal to a child,[275] and gave rise to\r\nserious symptoms in others, was composed as follows:--\r\n\r\n[275] Casper’s 204th case.\r\n\r\n                                Per cent.\r\n  Phosphorus,                      1·4\r\n  Flowers of sulphur,             42·2\r\n  Flour,                          42·2\r\n  Sugar,                          14·2\r\n                                 ------\r\n                                 100·00\r\n\r\nThree common receipts give the following proportions:--\r\n\r\n                                Per cent.\r\n  Phosphorus,                      1·5\r\n  Lard,                           18·4\r\n  Sugar,                          18·4\r\n  Flour,                          61·7\r\n                                 ------\r\n                                 100·00\r\n\r\n                               Per cent.\r\n  Phosphorus,                      1·2\r\n  Warm water,                     26·7\r\n  Rye flour,                      26·7\r\n  Melted butter,                  26·7\r\n  Sugar,                          18·7\r\n                                 ------\r\n                                 100·00\r\n\r\n                                Per cent.\r\n  Phosphorus,                      1·6\r\n  Nut oil,                        15·7\r\n  Warm water,                     31·5\r\n  Flour,                          31·5\r\n  Sugar,                          19·7\r\n                                 ------\r\n                                 100·00\r\n\r\nA very common phosphorus paste, to be bought everywhere in England, is\r\nsold in little pots; the whole amount of phosphorus contained in these\r\nvaries from ·324 to ·388 grm. (5 to 6 grains), the active constituent\r\nbeing a little over 4 per cent. Matches differ much in composition. Six\r\nmatchheads, which had been placed in an apple for criminal purposes, and\r\nwere submitted to Tardieu, were found to contain 20 mgrms. of\r\nphosphorus--_i.e._, ·33 grm. in 100. Mayet found in 100 matches 55\r\nmgrms. of phosphorus. Gonning[276] analysed ten different kinds of\r\nphosphorus matches with the following result:--Three English samples\r\ncontained in 100 matches 34, 33, and 32 mgrms. of phosphorus: a Belgian\r\nsample, 38 mgrms.; and 5 others of unknown origin, 12, 17, 28, 32, and\r\n41 mgrms. respectively.

Phosphorus may be considered as the\r\nfavourite poison which the common people on the Continent employ for the\r\npurpose of self-destruction. It is an agent within the reach of anyone\r\nwho has 2 sous in his pocket, wherewith to buy a box of matches, but to\r\nthe educated and those who know the horrible and prolonged torture\r\nensuing from a toxic dose of phosphorus, such a means of exit from life\r\nwill never be favoured.\r\n\r\nOtto Schraube[277] has collected 92 cases from Meischner’s work,[278]\r\nand added 16 which had come under his own observation, giving in all 108\r\ncases. Seventy-one (or 65 per cent.) of these were suicidal--of the\r\nsuicides 24 were males, 47 females (12 of the latter being prostitutes);\r\n21 of the cases were those of murder, 11 were accidental, and in 3 the\r\ncause was not ascertained. The number of cases in successive years, and\r\nthe kind of poison used, is given as follows:--\r\n\r\n[277] Schmidt’s _Jahrbuch der ger.

Of the latter, 2 were caused by the use of\r\nphosphorus as a medicine, 13 by accidents due to phosphorus being in the\r\nhouse; in 1 case phosphorus was taken intentionally to try the effects\r\nof an antidote.[280] With regard to the form in which the poison was\r\ntaken, 2 of the 76, as already mentioned, took it as prescribed by\r\nphysicians, the remaining 74 were divided between poisonings by\r\nphosphorus paste (22) and matches (52) = 70 per cent. Of the 76 cases, 6\r\nwere children, 43 adult males, 13 adult females, and 14 adults, sex not\r\ngiven. Of the 76 cases, 42, or 55·3 per cent., died--a much smaller rate\r\nof mortality than that shown by Schraube’s collection.\r\n\r\n[279] Dr. Dannenberg has shown by direct experiment that a poisonous\r\ndose of phosphorus may be introduced into spirits or coffee, and the\r\nmixture have but little odour or taste of phosphorus.--Schuchardt in\r\nMaschka’s _Handbuch_.\r\n\r\n[280] Géry, “_Ueber Terpentinessenz als Gegenmittel gegen Phosphor_,” in\r\n_Gaz. Hebd. de Méd._, 2 sér., x. 2, 1873.\r\n\r\n§ 277. =Fatal Dose.=--The smallest dose on record is that mentioned by\r\nLobenstein Lobel, of Jena, where a lunatic died from taking 7·5 mgrms.\r\n(·116 grain). There are other cases clearly indicating that this small\r\nquantity may produce dangerous symptoms in a healthy adult.\r\n\r\n§ 278. =Effects of Phosphorus.=--Phosphorus is excessively poisonous,\r\nand will destroy life, provided only that it enters the body in a fine\r\nstate of division, but if taken in coarse pieces no symptoms may follow,\r\nfor it has been proved that single lumps of phosphorus will go the whole\r\nlength of a dog’s intestinal canal without causing appreciable loss of\r\nweight, and without destroying life.[281] Magendie injected _oleum\r\nphosphoratum_ into the veins, and although the animals experimented on\r\nexhaled white fumes, and not a few died asphyxiated, yet no symptoms of\r\nphosphorus poisoning resulted--an observation confirmed by others--the\r\nreason being that the phosphorus particles in a comparatively coarse\r\nstate of division were arrested in the capillaries of the lung, and may\r\nbe said to have been, as it were, outside the body. On the other hand,\r\nA. Brunner,[282] working in L. Hermann’s laboratory, having injected\r\ninto the veins phosphorus in such a fine emulsion that the phosphorus\r\ncould pass the lung capillaries, found that there were no exhalations of\r\nwhite fumes, but that the ordinary symptoms of phosphorus poisoning soon\r\nmanifested themselves. Phosphorus paste, by the method of manufacture,\r\nis in a state of extreme sub-division, and hence all the phosphorus\r\npastes are extremely poisonous.\r\n\r\n[281] Reveil, _Ann. d’Hygiène Publ._ (3), xii. p. 370.\r\n\r\n[282] _Arch. f. d. Ges. Physiologie_, iii. p. 1.\r\n\r\n§ 279. In a few poisons there is a difference, more or less marked,\r\nbetween the general symptoms produced on man, and those noticeable in\r\nthe different classes of animals; but with phosphorus, the effects on\r\nanimals appear to agree fairly with those witnessed most frequently in\r\nman. Tardieu (who has written perhaps the best and most complete\r\nclinical record of phosphorus poisoning extant) divides the cases under\r\nthree classes, and to use his own words:--“I think it useful to\r\nestablish that poisoning by phosphorus in its course, sometimes rapid,\r\nsometimes slow, exhibits in its symptoms three distinct forms--a common\r\nform, a nervous form, and a hæmorrhagic form. I recognise that, in\r\ncertain cases, these three forms may succeed each other, and may only\r\nconstitute periods of poisoning; but it is incontestable that each of\r\nthem may show itself alone, and occupy the whole course of the illness\r\nproduced by the poison.”[283] Premising that the common form is a\r\nblending of irritant, nervous, and hæmorrhagic symptoms, I adopt here in\r\npart Tardieu’s division. The name of “hæmorrhagic form” may be given to\r\nthat in which hæmorrhage is the predominant feature, and the “nervous”\r\nto that in which the brain and spinal cord are from the first affected.\r\nThere yet remain, however, a few cases which have an entirely anomalous\r\ncourse, and do not fall under any of the three classes.\r\n\r\n[283] _Étude Médico-Légale et Clinique sur l’Empoisonnement_, Paris,\r\n1875, p. 483.\r\n\r\nFrom a study of 121 recorded cases of phosphorus poisoning, I believe\r\nthe relative frequency of the different forms to be as follows:--The\r\ncommon form 83 per cent., hæmorrhagic 10 per cent., nervous 6 per cent.,\r\nanomalous 1 per cent. The “anomalous” are probably over-estimated, for\r\nthe reason that cases presenting ordinary features are not necessarily\r\npublished, but others are nearly always chronicled in detail.\r\n\r\n§ 280. =Common Form.=--At the moment of swallowing, a disagreeable taste\r\nand smell are generally experienced, and there may be immediate and\r\nintense pain in the throat, gullet, and stomach, and almost immediate\r\nretching and vomiting. The throat and tongue also may become swollen and\r\npainful; but in a considerable number of cases the symptoms are not at\r\nonce apparent, but are delayed from one to six hours--rarely longer. The\r\nperson’s breath may be phosphorescent before he feels in any way\r\naffected, and he may go about his business and perform a number of acts\r\nrequiring both time and mental integrity. Pain in the stomach (which, in\r\nsome of the cases, takes the form of violent cramp and vomiting)\r\nsucceeds; the matters vomited may shine in the dark, and are often\r\ntinged with blood. Diarrhœa is sometimes present, sometimes absent;\r\nsleeplessness for the first night or two is very common. The pulse is\r\nvariable, sometimes frequent, sometimes slow; the temperature in the\r\nmorning is usually from 36·0° to 36·5°, in the evening 37° to 38°.\r\n\r\nThe next symptom is jaundice. I have notes of the exact occurrence of\r\njaundice in 23 cases, as follows:--In 1 within twenty-four hours, in 3\r\nwithin thirty-six hours, in 3 within two days, in 11 within three days,\r\nin 1 within four days, in 1 within five days, in 1 within nine days, in\r\n1 within eighteen days, and in 1 within twenty-seven days; so that in\r\nabout 78 per cent. jaundice occurred before the end of the third day.\r\nOut of 26 cases, in which the patients lived long enough for the\r\noccurrence of jaundice, in 3 (or 11 per cent.) it was entirely absent.\r\nIn 132 cases recorded by Lewin, Meischner, and Heisler, jaundice\r\noccurred in 65, or about 49 per cent., but it must be remembered, that\r\nin many of these cases the individual died before it had time to\r\ndevelop. The jaundice having thoroughly pronounced itself, the system\r\nmay be considered as not only under the influence of the toxic action of\r\nphosphorus, but as suffering in addition from all the accidents\r\nincidental to the retention of the biliary secretion in the blood; nor\r\nis there from this point any special difference between phosphorus\r\npoisoning and certain affections of the liver--such, for example, as\r\nacute yellow atrophy. There is retention of urine, sleeplessness,\r\nheadache, frequent vomiting, painful and often involuntary evacuations\r\nfrom the bowels, and occasionally skin affections, such as urticaria or\r\nerythema. The case terminates either by acute delirium with fever,\r\nfollowed by fatal coma, or, in a few instances, coma comes on, and the\r\npatient passes to death in sleep without delirium. In this common form\r\nthere is in a few cases, at the end of from twenty-four to thirty hours,\r\na remission of the symptoms, and a non-medical observer might imagine\r\nthat the patient was about to recover without further discomfort; but\r\nthen jaundice supervenes, and the course is as described. Infants often\r\ndo not live long enough for the jaundiced stage to develop, but die\r\nwithin twenty-four hours, the chief symptoms being vomiting and\r\nconvulsions.\r\n\r\n§ 281. =Hæmorrhagic Form.=--The symptoms set in as just detailed, and\r\njaundice appears, but accompanied by a new and terrible train of\r\nevents--viz., great effusion of blood. In some cases the blood has been\r\npoured out simultaneously from the nose, mouth, bladder, kidneys, and\r\nbowels. Among women there is excessive hæmorrhagia. The liver is found\r\nto be swollen and painful; the bodily weakness is great. Such cases are\r\nusually of long duration, and a person may die months after taking the\r\npoison from weakness, anæmia, and general cachexia. In many of its\r\nphases the hæmorrhagic form resembles scurvy, and, as in scurvy, there\r\nare spots of purpura all over the body.\r\n\r\n§ 282. =The nervous form= is less common than the two forms just\r\ndescribed. From the beginning, there are strange creeping sensations\r\nabout the limbs, followed by painful cramps, repeated faintings, and\r\ngreat somnolence. Jaundice, as usual, sets in, erythematous spots appear\r\non the skin, and, about the fifth day, delirium of an acute character\r\nbreaks out, and lock-jaw and convulsions close the scene.\r\n\r\nThe following are one or two brief abstracts of anomalous cases in which\r\nsymptoms are either wanting, or run a course entirely different from any\r\nof the three forms described:--\r\n\r\nA woman, aged 20, took about 3 grains of phosphorus in the form of\r\nrat-paste. She took the poison at six in the evening, behaved according\r\nto her wont, and sat down and wrote a letter to the king. During the\r\nnight she vomited once, and died the next morning at six o’clock,\r\nexactly twelve hours after taking the poison. There appear to have been\r\nno symptoms whatever, save the single vomiting, to which may be added\r\nthat in the course of the evening her breath had a phosphorus odour and\r\nwas luminous.[284]\r\n\r\n[284] Casper’s 205th case.\r\n\r\nA girl swallowed a quantity of phosphorus paste, but there were no\r\nmarked symptoms until the fifth day, on which there was sickness and\r\npurging. She died on the seventh day. A remarkable blueness of the\r\nfinger nails was observed a little before death, and was noticeable\r\nafterwards.[285]\r\n\r\n[285] Taylor on _Poisons_, p. 277.\r\n\r\n§ 283. =Sequelæ.=--In several cases in which the patients have recovered\r\nfrom phosphorus poisoning, there have been observed paralytic\r\naffections.[286] O. Bollinger has recorded a case in which paralysis of\r\nthe foot followed;[287] in another, published by Bettelheim,[288] there\r\nwere peculiar cerebral and spinal symptoms. Most of these cases are to\r\nbe explained as disturbance or loss of function from small hæmorrhages\r\nin the nervous substance.\r\n\r\n[286] See Gallavardin, _Les Paralyses Phosphoriques_, Paris, 1865.\r\n\r\n[287] _Deutsches Archiv f. klin. Med._, Bd. 6, Hft. 1, S. 94, 1869.\r\n\r\n[288] _Wiener Med. Presse_, 1868, No. 41.\r\n\r\n§ 284. =Period at which the first Symptoms commence.=--The time when the\r\nsymptoms commence is occasionally of importance from a forensic point of\r\nview. I find that out of 28 cases in which the commencement of evident\r\nsymptoms--_i.e._, pain, or vomiting, or illness--is precisely recorded,\r\nin 8 the symptoms were described as either immediate or within a few\r\nminutes after swallowing the poison; in 6 the symptoms commenced within\r\nthe hour; in 3 within two hours; in other 3 within four hours; and in 1\r\nwithin six hours. One was delayed until the lapse of twelve hours, 1\r\nfrom sixteen to eighteen hours, 1 two, and another five days. We may,\r\ntherefore, expect that in half the cases which may occur, the symptoms\r\nwill commence within the hour, and more than 80 per cent. within six\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n§ 285. =Period of Death.=--In 129 cases death took place as follows:--In\r\n17 within twenty-four hours, in 30 within two days, in 103 within seven\r\ndays. Three patients lived eight days, 6 nine days, 13 ten days, 1\r\neleven days, 1 sixteen days, 1 seventeen days, and 1 survived eight\r\nmonths. It hence follows that 79·8 per cent. of the fatal cases die\r\nwithin the week.\r\n\r\n§ 286. =Phosphorus Vapour.=--There are one or two cases on record of\r\nacute poisoning by phosphorus in the form of vapour. The symptoms are\r\nsomewhat different from the effects produced by the finely-divided\r\nsolid, and in general terms it may be said that phosphorus vapour is\r\nmore apt to produce the rarer “nervous” form of poisoning than the solid\r\nphosphorus.\r\n\r\nBouchardat[289] mentions the case of a druggist who, while preparing a\r\nlarge quantity of rat-poison in a close room, inhaled phosphorus vapour.\r\nHe fainted repeatedly, fell into a complete state of prostration, and\r\ndied within a week.\r\n\r\n[289] _Annuaire de Thérap._, 1874, p. 109; Schuchardt in Maschka’s\r\n_Handbuch_; also Schmidt’s _Jahrbuch_, 1846, Bd. 51, S. 101.\r\n\r\nThe following interesting case came under the observation of Professor\r\nMagnus Huss:--A man, thirty-nine years old, married, was admitted into\r\nthe Seraphin-Lazareth, Stockholm, on the 2nd of February 1842. He had\r\nbeen occupied three years in the manufacture of phosphorus matches, and\r\ninhabited the room in which the materials were preserved. He had always\r\nbeen well-conducted in every way, and in good health, until a year\r\npreviously, when a large quantity of the material for the manufacture of\r\nthe matches accidentally caught fire and exploded. In his endeavours to\r\nextinguish the flames, he breathed a large quantity of the vapour, and\r\nhe fell for a time unconscious. The spine afterwards became so weak that\r\nhe could not hold himself up, and he lost, in a great measure, power\r\nover his legs and arms. On admission, his condition was as follows:--He\r\ncould make a few uncertain and staggering steps, his knees trembled, his\r\narms shook, and if he attempted to grasp anything when he lay in bed,\r\nthere were involuntary twitchings of groups of muscles. There was no\r\npain; the sensibility of the skin was unchanged; he had formication in\r\nthe left arm; the spine was neither sensitive to pressure, nor unusually\r\nsensitive to heat (as, _e.g._, to the application of a hot sponge); the\r\norgans of special sense were not affected, but his speech was somewhat\r\nthick. He lived to 1845 in the same condition, but the paralysis became\r\nworse. There does not seem to have been any autopsy.\r\n\r\nThe effects of phosphorus vapour may be still further elucidated by one\r\nof Eulenberg’s[290] experiments on a rabbit. The vapour of burning\r\nphosphorus, mixed with much air, was admitted into a wooden hutch in\r\nwhich a strong rabbit sat. After 5 mgrms. of phosphorus had been in this\r\nmanner consumed, the only symptoms in half an hour were salivation, and\r\nquickened and somewhat laboured respiration. After twenty-four hours had\r\nelapsed there was sudden indisposition, the animal fell as if lifeless,\r\nwith the hind extremities stretched out, and intestinal movements were\r\nvisible; there was also expulsion of the urine. These epileptiform\r\nseizures seem to have continued more or less for twelve days, and then\r\nceased. After fourteen days the experiment was repeated on the same\r\nrabbit. The animal remained exposed to the vapour for three-quarters of\r\nan hour, when the epilepsy showed itself as before, and, indeed, almost\r\nregularly after feeding. Between the attacks the respiration was slowed.\r\nEight weeks afterwards there was an intense icterus, which disappeared\r\nat the end of ten weeks.\r\n\r\n[290] _Gewerbe Hygiene_, p. 255.\r\n\r\n§ 287. =Chronic phosphorus poisoning= has frequently been noticed in\r\npersons engaged either in the manufacture of phosphorus or in its\r\ntechnical application. Some have held that the symptoms are due to an\r\noxidation product of phosphorus rather than to phosphorus itself; but in\r\none of Eulenberg’s experiments, in which a dove was killed by breathing\r\nphosphorus fumes evolved by phosphorus oil, phosphorus was chemically\r\nrecognised in the free state in the lungs. The most constant and\r\npeculiar effect of breathing small quantities of phosphorus vapour is a\r\nnecrosis of the lower jaw. There is first inflammation of the periosteum\r\nof the jaw, which proceeds to suppuration and necrosis of a greater or\r\nsmaller portion. The effects may develop with great suddenness, and end\r\nfatally. Thus Fournier and Olliver[291] relate the case of a girl,\r\nfourteen years old, who, after working four years in a phosphorus\r\nmanufactory, was suddenly affected with periostitis of the upper jaw,\r\nand with intense anæmia. An eruption of purpuric spots ensued, and she\r\ndied comatose. There is now little doubt, that minute doses of\r\nphosphorus have a specific action on the bones generally, and more\r\nespecially on the bones of the jaw. Wegner[292] administered small daily\r\ndoses to young animals, both in the state of vapour, and as a\r\nfinely-divided solid. The condition of the bones was found to be more\r\ncompact than normal, the medullary canals being smaller than in healthy\r\nbone, the ossification was quickened. The formation of callus in\r\nfractured limbs was also increased.\r\n\r\n[291] _Gaz. hebd. de Méd._, 29, p. 461, 1868.\r\n\r\n[292] Virchow’s _Arch. f. path. Anat._, lv. 11.\r\n\r\n§ 288. =Changes in the Urinary Secretion.=--It has been before stated\r\nthat, at a certain period of the illness, the renal secretion is\r\nscantier than in health, the urine diminishing, according to Lebert and\r\nWyss’s[293] researches, to one-half on the third, fourth, or fifth day.\r\nIt frequently contains albumen, blood, and casts. When jaundice is\r\npresent, the urine has then all the characters noticed in icterus;\r\nleucin and tyrosin, always present in acute yellow atrophy of the liver,\r\nhave been found in small quantity in jaundice through phosphorus; lactic\r\nacid is also present. The urea is much diminished, and, according to\r\nSchultzen and Riess,[294] may be towards death entirely absent. Lastly,\r\nit is said that there is an exhalation of either phosphorus vapour or\r\nphosphine from such urine. In some cases the urine is normal, _e.g._, in\r\na case recorded by E. H. Starling, M.D., and F. G. Hopkins, B.Sc.\r\n(_Guy’s Hospital Report_, 1890), in which a girl, aged 18, died on the\r\nfifth day after taking phosphorus paste, the liver was fatty, and there\r\nwas jaundice; but the urine contained neither leucin nor tyrosin, and\r\nwas stated to be generally normal.\r\n\r\n[293] _Archiv Générale de Méd._, 6 Sér., Tom. 12, 1868, p. 709.\r\n\r\n[294] _Annalen der Charité_, Berlin.\r\n\r\n§ 289. =Changes in the blood= during life have been several times\r\nobserved. In a case attended by M. Romellære of Brussels,[295] in which\r\na man took the paste from 300 matches, and under treatment by turpentine\r\nrecovered, the blood was frequently examined, and the leucocytes found\r\nmuch increased in number. There is a curious conflict of evidence as to\r\nwhether phosphorus prevents coagulation of the blood or not. Nasse\r\nasserted that phosphorated oil given to a dog fully prevented\r\ncoagulation; P. I. Liebreck[296] also, in a series of researches, found\r\nthe blood dark, fluid, and in perfect solution. These observations were\r\nalso supported by V. Bibra and Schuchardt.[297] Nevertheless, Lebert and\r\nWyss found the blood, whether in the veins or in extravasations, in a\r\nnormal condition. Phosphorus increases the fatty contents of the blood.\r\nRitter found that phosphorus mixed with starch, and given to a dog,\r\nraised the fatty content from the normal 2 per 1000 up to 3·41 and 3·47\r\nper 1000. Eug. Menard[298] saw in the blood from the jugular and portal\r\nveins, as well as in extravasations, microscopic fat globules and fine\r\nneedle-shaped crystals soluble in ether.\r\n\r\n[295] Tardieu, _op. cit._, Case 31.\r\n\r\n[296] _Diss. de Venefico Phosphoreo Acuto_, Upsal, 1845.\r\n\r\n[297] V.

(about 40 min.), frequently administered, seems to\r\nact as a true antidote, and a large percentage of cases treated early in\r\nthis way recover.\r\n\r\n§ 291. =Poisonous Effects of Phosphine (phosphuretted\r\nhydrogen).=--Experiments on pigeons, on rats, and other animals, and a\r\nfew very rare cases among men, have shown that phosphine has an exciting\r\naction on the respiratory mucous membranes, and a secondary action on\r\nthe nervous system. Eulenberg[299] exposed a pigeon to an atmosphere\r\ncontaining 1·68 per cent. of phosphine. There was immediate unrest; at\r\nthe end of three minutes, quickened and laboured breathing (100 a\r\nminute); after seven minutes, the bird lay prostrate, with shivering of\r\nthe body and wide open beak; after eight minutes, there was vomiting;\r\nafter nine minutes, slow breathing (34 per minute); after twelve\r\nminutes, convulsive movements of the wings; and after thirteen minutes,\r\ngeneral convulsions and death.\r\n\r\n[299] _Gewerbe Hygiene_, p. 273.\r\n\r\nThe membranes of the brain were found strongly injected, and there were\r\nextravasations. In the mucous membrane of the crop there was also an\r\nextravasation. The lungs externally and throughout were of a dirty\r\nbrown-red colour; the entire heart was filled with coagulated blood,\r\nwhich was weakly acid in reaction.\r\n\r\nIn a second experiment with another pigeon, there was no striking\r\nsymptom save that of increased frequency of respiration and loss of\r\nappetite; at the end of four days it was found dead. There was much\r\ncongestion of the cerebral veins and vessels, the mucous membrane of the\r\ntrachea and bronchi were weakly injected, and the first showed a thin,\r\nplastic, diphtheritic-like exudation.\r\n\r\nDr. Henderson’s[300] researches on rats may also be noticed here. He\r\nfound that an atmosphere consisting entirely of phosphine killed rats\r\nwithin ten minutes, an atmosphere with 1 per cent. in half an hour. The\r\nsymptoms observed were almost exactly similar to those noticed in the\r\nfirst experiment on the pigeon quoted above, and the _post-mortem_\r\nappearances were not dissimilar. With smaller quantities of the gas, the\r\nfirst symptom was increased frequency of the respiration; then the\r\nanimals showed signs of suffering intense irritation of the skin,\r\nscratching and biting at it incessantly; afterwards they became drowsy,\r\nand assumed a very peculiar attitude, sitting down on all-fours, with\r\nthe back bent forward, and the nose pushed backwards between the\r\nforepaws, so as to bring the forehead against the floor of the cage.\r\nWhen in this position, the rat presented the appearance of a curled-up\r\nhedgehog. Phosphine, when injected into the rectum, is also fatal; the\r\nanimals exhale some of the gas from the lungs, and the breath,\r\ntherefore, reduces solutions of silver nitrate.[301]\r\n\r\n[300] _Journ. Anat. and Physiol._, vol. xiii. p. 19.\r\n\r\n[301] Dybskowsky, _Med. Chem. Untersuchungen aus Hoppe-Seyler’s Labor.\r\nin Tübingen_, p. 57.\r\n\r\nBrenner[302] has recorded the case of a man twenty-eight years old, a\r\npharmaceutist, who is supposed to have suffered from illness caused by\r\nrepeated inhalations of minute quantities of phosphine. He was engaged\r\nfor two and a half years in the preparation of hypophosphites; his\r\nillness commenced with spots before the eyes, and inability to fix the\r\nattention. His teeth became very brittle, and healthy as well as carious\r\nbroke off from very slight causes. Finally, a weakness of the arms and\r\nlimbs developed in the course of nine months into complete locomotor\r\nataxy.\r\n\r\n[302] _St. Petersburg Med. Zeitschr._, 4 Hft., 1865.\r\n\r\n§ 292. Blood takes up far more phosphine than water. Dybskowsky found\r\nthat putting the coefficient of solubility of phosphine in pure water at\r\n·1122 at 15°, the coefficient for venous blood was ·13, and for arterial\r\n26·73; hence the richer the blood is in oxygen the more phosphine is\r\nabsorbed. It seems probable that the poisonous gas reacts on the\r\noxyhæmoglobin of the blood, and phosphorous acid is formed. This is\r\nsupported by the fact that a watery extract of such blood reduces silver\r\nnitrate, and has been also found feebly acid. The dark blood obtained\r\nfrom animals poisoned by phosphine, when examined spectroscopically, has\r\nbeen found to exhibit a band in the violet.\r\n\r\n§ 293. =Post-mortem Appearances.=--There are a few perfectly well\r\nauthenticated cases showing that phosphorus may cause death, and yet no\r\nlesion be discovered afterwards. Thus, Tardieu[303] cites a case in\r\nwhich a woman, aged 45, poisoned herself with phosphorus, and died\r\nsuddenly the seventh day afterwards. Dr. Mascarel examined the viscera\r\nwith the greatest care, but could discover absolutely no abnormal\r\nconditions; the only symptoms during life were vomiting, and afterwards\r\na little indigestion. It may, however, be remarked that the microscope\r\ndoes not seem to have been employed, and that probably a close\r\nexamination of the heart would have revealed some alteration of its\r\nultimate structure. The case quoted, by Taylor[304] may also be\r\nmentioned, in which a child was caught in the act of sucking phosphorus\r\nmatches, and died ten days afterwards in convulsions. None of the\r\nordinary _post-mortem_ signs of poisoning by phosphorus were met with,\r\nbut the intestines were reddened throughout, and there were no less than\r\nten invaginations; but the case is altogether a doubtful one, and no\r\nphosphorus may actually have been taken. It is very difficult to give in\r\na limited space anything like a full picture of the different lesions\r\nfound after death from phosphorus, for they vary according as to whether\r\nthe death is speedy or prolonged, whether the phosphorus has been taken\r\nas a finely-divided solid, or in the form of vapour, &c. It may,\r\nhowever, be shortly said, that the most common changes are fatty\r\ninfiltration of the liver and kidneys, fatty degeneration of the heart,\r\nenlargement of the liver, ecchymoses in the serous membranes, in the\r\nmuscular, in the fatty, and in the mucous tissues. When death occurs\r\nbefore jaundice supervenes, there may be little in the aspect of the\r\ncorpse to raise a suspicion of poison; but if intense jaundice has\r\nexisted during life, the yellow staining of the skin, and it may be,\r\nspots of purpura, will suggest to the experienced pathologist the\r\npossibility of phosphorus poisoning. In the mouth and throat there will\r\nseldom be anything abnormal. In one or two cases of rapid death among\r\ninfants, some traces of the matches which had been sucked were found\r\nclinging to the gums. The stomach may be healthy, but the most common\r\nappearance is a swelling of the mucous membrane and superficial\r\nerosions. Virchow,[305] who was the first to call attention to this\r\npeculiar grey swelling of the intestinal mucous membrane under the name\r\nof _gastritis glandularis_ or _gastradenitis_, shows that it is due to a\r\nfatty degeneration of the epithelial cells, and that it is by no means\r\npeculiar to phosphorus poisoning. The swelling may be seen in\r\nproperly-prepared sections to have its essential seat in the glands of\r\nthe mucous membrane; the glands are enlarged, their openings filled with\r\nlarge cells, and each single cell is finely granular. Little centres of\r\nhæmorrhage, often microscopically small, are seen, and may be the\r\ncentres of small inflammations; their usual situation is on the summit\r\nof the rugæ. Very similar changes are witnessed after death from\r\nsepticæmia, pyæmia, diphtheria, and other diseases. The softening of the\r\nstomach, gangrene, and deep erosions, recorded by the earlier authors,\r\nhave not been observed of late years, and probably were due to\r\n_post-mortem_ changes, and not to processes during life. The same\r\nchanges are to be seen in the intestines, and there are numerous\r\nextravasations in the peritoneum.\r\n\r\n[303] _L’Empoisonnement_, p. 520.\r\n\r\n[304] _Poisons_, 3rd ed., p. 276.\r\n\r\n[305] Virchow’s _Archiv. f. path. Anat._, Bd. 31, Hft. 3, 399.\r\n\r\nThe liver shows of all the organs the most characteristic signs; a more\r\nor less advanced fatty infiltration of its structure takes place, which\r\nwas first described as caused by phosphorus by Hauff in 1860.[306] It\r\nis the most constant pathological evidence both in man and animal, and\r\nseems to occur at a very early period, Munk and Leyden having found a\r\nfatty degeneration in the liver far advanced in twenty-four hours[307]\r\nafter poisoning. In rats and mice poisoned with paste, I have found this\r\nevident to the naked eye twelve hours after the fatal dose. The liver is\r\nmostly large, but in a case[308] recorded in the _Lancet_, July 14,\r\n1888, the liver was shrunken; it has a pale yellow (or sometimes an\r\nintense yellow) colour; on section the cut surface presents a mottled\r\nappearance; the serous envelopes, especially along the course of the\r\nvessels, exhibit extravasations of blood. The liver itself is more\r\ndeficient in blood than in the normal condition, and the more bloodless\r\nit is, the greater the fatty infiltration.\r\n\r\n[306] Hauff collected 12 cases, and found a fatty liver in\r\n11.--_Würtemb. Med. Corresp. Bl._, 1860, No. 34.\r\n\r\n[307] _Die acute Phosphor-Vergiftung_, Berlin, 1865.\r\n\r\n[308] This case, from the similarity of the pathological appearances to\r\nthose produced by yellow atrophy, deserves fuller notice:--“Frances A.\r\nCowley, aged 20, on her own admission, took some rat paste on Tuesday,\r\nJune 19th. Death ensued eleven days later. The initial symptoms were not\r\nvery marked. Nausea and vomiting continued with moderate severity for a\r\nfew days and then ceased. There ensued a feeling of depression. Towards\r\nthe end insensibility, icterus, and somewhat profuse metrorrhagia\r\nsupervened. At the necropsy the skin and conjunctivæ were observed of a\r\nbright yellow colour. There was no organic disease save of a recent\r\nnature, and entirely attributable to the action of the poison ingested.\r\nThe stomach contained about three-quarters of a pint of dark\r\nclaret-coloured fluid, consisting largely of blood derived from\r\ncapillary hæmorrhage from the mucous membrane. There was no solution of\r\ncontinuity of the mucous membrane, which showed traces of recent\r\nirritation. The whole surface presented a yellow icteric tint, except\r\nthe summits of some of the rugæ, which were of a bright pink colour.\r\nThere was also faint wrinkling of the mucous membrane. The upper part of\r\nthe small intestine was affected in much the same manner as the stomach.\r\nThe large intestine contained a quantity of almost colourless fæces. The\r\nliver was shrunken, weighing only 26 ozs., and both on its outer and\r\nsectional surface exactly resembled the appearances produced by acute\r\nyellow atrophy, except that there were greater congestion and\r\ninterstitial hæmorrhage in patches. The lobules of the liver were in\r\nmany places unrecognisable; in others they stood in bold relief as\r\nbrilliant canary-yellow patches, standing in strong contrast to the deep\r\ndark-red areas of congestion and extravasation. The gall-bladder\r\ncontained about 2 drachms of thin greyish fluid, apparently all but\r\ndevoid of bile. The urinary bladder was empty; the kidneys were\r\nenlarged; the cortex was very pale and bile-stained, of greater depth\r\nthan natural, and of softer consistence. The spleen was not enlarged,\r\nnor was it in the least degree softened. In addition to the bleeding\r\nfrom the uterus noticed during life, there was capillary hæmorrhage into\r\nthe right lung and pleura, into the pericardium, and, as already\r\nmentioned, into the stomach. The brain was healthy.”\r\n\r\nIn the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons there is a preparation\r\n(No. 2737) of the section of a liver derived from a case of phosphorus\r\npoisoning.\r\n\r\nA girl, aged 18, after two days’ illness, was admitted into Guy’s\r\nHospital. She confessed to having eaten a piece of bread coated with\r\nphosphorus paste. She had great abdominal pain, and died on the seventh\r\nday after taking the phosphorus. A few hours before her death she was\r\nprofoundly and suddenly collapsed. The liver weighed 66 ozs. The\r\noutlines of the hepatic lobules were very distinct, each central vein\r\nbeing surrounded by an opaque yellowish zone; when fresh the hue was\r\nmore uniform, and the section was yellowish-white in colour. A\r\nmicroscopical examination of the hepatic cells showed them laden with\r\nfat globules, especially in the central parts of the liver.\r\n\r\nThe microscopic appearances are also characteristic. In a case of\r\nsuicidal poisoning by phosphorus, in which death took place on the\r\nseventh day, the liver was very carefully examined by Dr. G. F. Goodart,\r\nwho reported as follows:--\r\n\r\n    “Under a low power the structure of the liver is still readily\r\n    recognisable, and in this the specimen differs from slides of three\r\n    cases of acute yellow atrophy that I have in my possession. The\r\n    hepatic cells are present in large numbers, and have their natural\r\n    trabecular arrangement. The columns are abnormally separated by\r\n    dilated blood or lymph-spaces, and the individual cells are cloudy\r\n    and ill-defined. The portal channels are everywhere characterised by\r\n    a crowd of small nuclei which stain with logwood deeply. The\r\n    epithelium of the smaller ducts is cloudy, and blocks the tubes in\r\n    many cases. Under a high power (one-fifth) it is seen that the\r\n    hepatic cells are exceedingly ill-defined in outline, and full of\r\n    granules and even drops of oil. But in many parts, even where the\r\n    cells themselves are hazy, the nucleus is still fairly visible. It\r\n    appears to me that, in opposition to what others have described, the\r\n    nuclei of the cells have in great measure resisted the degenerative\r\n    process. The change in the cells is uniform throughout each lobule,\r\n    but some lobules are rather more affected than others. The\r\n    blood-spaces between the cells are empty, and the liver appears to\r\n    be very bloodless. The portal canals are uniformly studded with\r\n    small round nuclei or cells, which are in part, and might be said in\r\n    great part, due to increase of the connective tissue or to a\r\n    cirrhotic process. But I am more disposed to favour the view that\r\n    they are due to migration from the blood-vessels, because they are\r\n    so uniform in size, and the hepatic cells and connective tissue in\r\n    their neighbourhood are undergoing no changes in the way of growth\r\n    whatever. I cannot detect any fatty changes in the vessels, but some\r\n    of the smaller biliary ducts contain some cloudy albuminous\r\n    material, and their nucleation is not distinct. No retained biliary\r\n    pigment is visible.”[309]\r\n\r\n[309] “A Recent Case of Suicide,” by Herbert J. Capon, M.D.--_Lancet_,\r\nMarch 18, 1882.\r\n\r\nOscar Wyss,[310] in the case of a woman twenty-three years old, who died\r\non the fifth day after taking phosphorus, describes, in addition to the\r\nfatty appearance of the cells, a new formation of cells lying between\r\nthe lobules and in part surrounding the gall-ducts and the branches of\r\nthe portal vein and hepatic artery.\r\n\r\n[310] Virchow’s _Archiv. f. path. Anat._, Bd. 33, Hft. 3, S. 432, 1865.\r\n\r\nSalkowsky[311] found in animals, which he killed a few hours after\r\nadministering to them toxic doses of phosphorus, notable hyperæmia of\r\nthe throat, intestine, liver, and kidneys--both the latter organs being\r\nlarger than usual. The liver cells were swollen, and the nuclei very\r\nevident, but they contained no fat, fatty drops being formed afterwards.\r\n\r\n[311] _Ibid._, Bd. 34, Hft. 1 u. 2, S. 73, 1865.\r\n\r\n§ 294. =The kidneys= exhibit alterations very similar and analogous to\r\nthose of the liver. They are mostly enlarged, congested, and flabby,\r\nwith extravasations under the capsule, and show microscopic changes\r\nessentially consisting in a fatty degeneration of the epithelium. In\r\ncases attended with hæmorrhage, the tubuli may be here and there filled\r\nwith blood. The fatty epithelium is especially seen in the contorted\r\ntubes, and the walls of the vessels, both of the capsule and of the\r\nmalpighian bodies, also undergo the same fatty change. In cases in which\r\ndeath has occurred rapidly, the kidneys have been found almost healthy,\r\nor a little congested only. The pancreas has also been found with its\r\nstructure in part replaced by fatty elements.\r\n\r\nOf great significance are also the fatty changes in the general muscular\r\nsystem, and more especially in the heart. The muscular fibres of the\r\nheart quickly lose their transverse striæ, which are replaced by drops\r\nof fat. Probably this change is the cause of the sudden death not\r\nunfrequently met with in phosphorus poisoning.\r\n\r\n=In the lungs=, when the phosphorus is taken in substance, there is\r\nlittle “naked-eye” change, but Perls,[312] by manometric researches, has\r\nshown that the elasticity is always decreased. According to experiments\r\non animals, when the vapour is breathed, the mucous membrane is red,\r\ncongested, swollen, and has an acid reaction.\r\n\r\n[312] Deutsch. _Archiv f. klin. Med._, vi. Hft. 1, S. 1, 1869.\r\n\r\n=In the nervous system= no change has been remarked, save occasionally\r\nhæmorrhagic points and extravasations.\r\n\r\n§ 295. =Diagnostic Differences between Acute Yellow Atrophy of the Liver\r\nand Fatty Liver produced by Phosphorus.=--O. Schultzen and O. L. Riess\r\nhave collected and compared ten cases of fatty liver from phosphorus\r\npoisoning, and four cases of acute yellow atrophy of the liver, and,\r\naccording to them, the chief points of distinction are as follows:--In\r\nphosphorus poisoning the liver is large, doughy, equally yellow, and\r\nwith the acini well marked; while in acute yellow atrophy the liver is\r\ndiminished in size, tough, leathery, and of a dirty yellow hue, the\r\nacini not being well mapped out. The “phosphorus” liver, again, presents\r\nthe cells filled with large fat drops, or entirely replaced by them; but\r\nin the “atrophy” liver, the cells are replaced by a finely-nucleated\r\ndetritus and through newly-formed cellular tissue. Yellow atrophy seems\r\nto be essentially an inflammation of the intralobular connective tissue,\r\nwhile in phosphorus poisoning the cells become gorged by an infiltration\r\nof fat, which presses upon the vessels and lessens the blood supply,\r\nand the liver, in consequence, may, after a time, waste.\r\n\r\nThere is also a clinical distinction during life, not only in the\r\nlessening bulk of the liver in yellow atrophy, in opposition to the\r\nincrease of size in the large phosphorus liver, but also in the\r\ncomposition of the renal secretion. In yellow atrophy the urine contains\r\nso much leucine and tyrosin, that the simple addition of acetic acid\r\ncauses at once a precipitate. Schultzen and Riess also found in the\r\nurine, in cases of yellow atrophy, _oxymandelic acid_ (C₈H₈O₄), but in\r\ncases of phosphorus poisoning a nitrogenised acid, fusing at 184° to\r\n185°.\r\n\r\nAccording to Maschka, grey-white, knotty, fæcal masses are found in the\r\nintestines in yellow atrophy, but never in cases of phosphorus\r\npoisoning. In the latter, it is more common to find a slight intestinal\r\ncatarrh and fluid excreta.\r\n\r\n§ 296. =The Detection of Phosphorus=.--The following are the chief\r\nmethods in use for the separation and detection of phosphorus:[313]--\r\n\r\n[313] It has been recommended to dissolve the phosphorus out from\r\norganic matters by carbon disulphide. On evaporation of the latter the\r\nphosphorus is recognised by its physical properties. Such a method is of\r\nbut limited application, although it may sometimes be found useful. I\r\nhave successfully employed it in the extraction of phosphorus from the\r\ncrop of a fowl; but on this occasion it happened to be present in large\r\nquantity.\r\n\r\n1. =Mitscherlich’s Process=.--The essential feature of this process is\r\nsimply distillation of free phosphorus, and observation of its luminous\r\nproperties as the vapour condenses in the condensing tube. The\r\nconditions necessary for success are--(1) that the apparatus should be\r\nin total darkness;[314] and (2) that there should be no substance\r\npresent, such as alcohol or ammonia,[315] which, distilling over with\r\nthe phosphorus-vapour, could destroy its luminosity. A convenient\r\napparatus, and one certain to be in all laboratories, is an ordinary\r\nFlorence flask, containing the liquid to be tested, fitted to a glass\r\nLiebig’s condenser, supported on an iron sand-bath (which may, or may\r\nnot, have a thin layer of sand), and heated by a Fletcher’s low\r\ntemperature burner. The distillate is received into a flask. This\r\napparatus, if in darkness, works well; but should the observer wish to\r\nwork in daylight, the condenser must be enclosed in a box perfectly\r\nimpervious to light, and having a hole through which the luminosity of\r\nthe tube may be seen, the head of the operator and the box being covered\r\nwith a cloth. If there be a stream of water passing continuously\r\nthrough the condenser, a beautiful luminous ring of light appears in the\r\nupper part of the tube, where it remains fixed for some time. Should,\r\nhowever, the refrigeration be imperfect, the luminosity travels slowly\r\ndown the tube into the receiver. In any case, the delicacy of the test\r\nis extraordinary.[316] If the organic liquid is alkaline, or even\r\nneutral, there will certainly be some evolution of ammonia, which will\r\ndistil over before the phosphorus, and retard (or, if in sufficient\r\nquantity, destroy) the luminosity. In such a case it is well, as a\r\nprecaution, to add enough sulphuric acid to fix the ammonia, omitting\r\nsuch addition if the liquid to be operated upon is acid.\r\n\r\n[314] Any considerable amount of phosphorescence can, however, be\r\nobserved in twilight.\r\n\r\n[315] Many volatile substances destroy the luminous appearance of\r\nphosphorus vapour, _e.g._, chlorine, hydric sulphide, sulphur dioxide,\r\ncarbon disulphide, ether, alcohol, petroleum, turpentine, creasote, and\r\nmost essential oils. On the other hand, bromine, hydrochloric acid,\r\ncamphor, and carbonate of ammonia do not seem to interfere much with the\r\nphosphorescence.\r\n\r\n[316] Fresenius states that he and Neubauer, with 1 mgrm. of phosphorus\r\nin 200,000, recognised the light, which lasted for half an\r\nhour.--_Zeitschr. f. anal. Chem._, i. p. 336.\r\n\r\n2. =The Production of Phosphine= (PH₃).--Any method which produces\r\nphosphine (phosphuretted hydrogen), enabling that gas to be passed\r\nthrough nitrate of silver solution, may be used for the detection of\r\nphosphorus. Thus, Sonnenschein states that he has found phosphorus in\r\nextraordinary small amount, mixed with various substances, by heating\r\nwith potash in a flask, and passing the phosphine into silver nitrate,\r\nseparating the excess of silver, and recognising the phosphoric acid by\r\nthe addition of molybdate of ammonia.[317]\r\n\r\n[317] Sonnenschein, _Handbuch der gerichtlichen Chemie_, Berlin, 1869.\r\n\r\nThe usual way is, however, to produce phosphine by means of the action\r\non free phosphorus of nascent hydrogen evolved on dissolving metallic\r\nzinc in dilute sulphuric acid. Phosphine is formed by the action of\r\nnascent hydrogen on solid phosphorus, phosphorous acid, and\r\nhypophosphorous acid; but no phosphine can be formed in this way by the\r\naction of hydrogen on phosphoric acid.\r\n\r\nSince it may happen that no free phosphorus is present, but yet the\r\nfirst product (phosphorous acid) of its oxidation, the production of\r\nphosphine becomes a necessary test to make on failure of Mitscherlich’s\r\ntest; if no result follows the proper application of the two processes,\r\nthe probability is that phosphorus has not been taken.\r\n\r\nBlondlot and Dusart evolve hydrogen from zinc and dilute sulphuric acid,\r\nand pass the gas into silver nitrate; if the gas is pure, there is of\r\ncourse no reduction; the liquid to be tested is then added to the\r\nhydrogen-generating liquid, and if phosphorous or hypophosphorous acids\r\nbe present, a black precipitate of phosphor-silver will be produced. To\r\nprove that this black precipitate is neither that produced by SH₂, nor\r\nby antimony nor arsenic, the precipitate is collected and placed in the\r\napparatus to be presently described, and the spectroscopic appearances\r\nof the phosphine flame observed.\r\n\r\n3. =Tests Dependent on the Combustion of Phosphine= (PH₃).--A hydrogen\r\nflame, containing only a minute trace of phosphorus, or of the lower\r\nproducts of its oxidation, acquires a beautiful green tint, and\r\npossesses a characteristic _spectrum_. In order to obtain the latter in\r\nits best form, the amount of phosphine must not be too large, or the\r\nflame will become whitish and livid, and the bands lose their defined\r\ncharacter, rendering the spectrum continuous. Again, the orifice of the\r\ntube whence the gas escapes must not be too small; and the best result\r\nis obtained when the flame is cooled.\r\n\r\nM. Salet has proposed two excellent methods for the observation of\r\nphosphine by the spectroscope:--\r\n\r\n(1) He projects the phosphorus-flame on a plane vertical surface,\r\nmaintained constantly cold by means of a thin layer of running water;\r\nthe green colour is especially produced in the neighbourhood of the cool\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\n(2) At the level of the base of the flame, there is an annular space,\r\nthrough which a stream of cold air is continually blown upwards. Thus\r\ncooled, the light is very pronounced, and the band δ, which is almost\r\ninvisible in the ordinary method of examination, is plainly seen.[318]\r\n\r\n[318] Consult _Spectres Lumineux_, par M. Lecoq de Boisbaudran, Paris,\r\n1874. See also Christofle and Beilstrom’s “Abhandlung,” in _Fresenius’\r\nZeitschr. f. anal.

A is a vessel containing sulphuric acid; B\r\nis partly filled with granulated zinc, and hydrogen may be developed at\r\npleasure; _c_ contains a solution of nitrate of silver; _d_ is a tube at\r\nwhich the gas can be lit; _e_, a flask containing the fluid to be\r\ntested, and provided with a tube _f_, at which also the gas issuing can\r\nbe ignited. The orifice should be provided with a platinum nozzle. When\r\nthe hydrogen has displaced the air, both tubes are lit, and the two\r\nflames, being side by side, can be compared. Should any phosphorus come\r\nover from the zinc (a possibility which the interposed silver nitrate\r\nought to guard against), it is detected; the last flask is now gently\r\nwarmed, and if the flame is green, or, indeed, in any case, it should be\r\nexamined by the spectroscope.[319]\r\n\r\n[319] F. Selmi has proposed the simple dipping of a platinum loop into a\r\nliquid containing phosphoric acid, and then inserting it into the tip of\r\na hydrogen flame.\r\n\r\n§ 297. The spectrum, when fully developed, shows one band in the orange\r\nand yellow between C and D, but very close to D, and several bands in\r\nthe green. But the bands δ, γ, α, and β are the most characteristic. The\r\nband δ has its centre about the wave-length 599·4; it is easily\r\ndistinguished when the slit of the spectroscope is a little wide, but\r\nmay be invisible if the slit is too narrow. It is best seen by M.\r\nSalet’s second process, and, when cooled by a brisk current of air, it\r\nbroadens, and may extend closer to D. The band γ has a somewhat decided\r\nborder towards E, while it is nebulous towards D, and it is, therefore,\r\nvery difficult to say where it begins or where it ends; its centre may,\r\nhowever, be put at very near 109 of Boisbaudran’s scale, corresponding\r\nto W. L. 560·5, if the flame is free. This band is more distinct than β,\r\nbut with a strong current of air the reverse is the case. The middle of\r\nthe important band α is nearly marked by Fraunhofer’s line E.\r\nBoisbaudran gives it as coinciding with 122 of his scale W. L. 526·3. In\r\nordinary conditions (that is, with a free uncooled flame) this is the\r\nbrightest and most marked of all the bands. The approximate middle of\r\nthe band β is W. L. 510·6 (Boisbaudran’s scale 129·00).\r\n\r\n=Lipowitz’s Sulphur Test.=--Sulphur has the peculiar property of\r\ncondensing phosphorus on its surface, and of this Lipowitz proposed to\r\ntake advantage. Pieces of sulphur are digested some time with the liquid\r\nunder research, subsequently removed, and slightly dried. When examined\r\nin the dark, should phosphorus be present, they gleam strongly if rubbed\r\nwith the finger, and develop a phosphorus odour. The test is wanting in\r\ndelicacy, nor can it well be made quantitative; it has, however, an\r\nadvantage in certain cases, _e.g._, the detection of phosphorus in an\r\nalcoholic liquid.\r\n\r\nScherer’s test, as modified by Hager,[320] is a very delicate and\r\nalmost decisive test. The substances to be examined are placed in a\r\nflask with a little lead acetate (to prevent the possibility of any\r\nhydric sulphide being evolved), some ether added, and a strip of\r\nfilter-paper soaked in a solution of silver nitrate is then suspended in\r\nthe flask; this is conveniently done by making a slit in the bottom of\r\nthe cork, and in the slit securing the paper. The closed flask is placed\r\nin the dark, and if phosphorus is present, in a few minutes there is a\r\nblack stain. It may be objected that arsine will cause a similar\r\nstaining, but then arsine could hardly be developed under the\r\ncircumstances given. It is scarcely necessary to observe that the paper\r\nmust be wet.\r\n\r\n[320] _Pharm. Central-halle_, 20, 353.\r\n\r\n§ 298. =Chemical Examination of the Urine.=--It may be desirable, in any\r\ncase of suspected phosphorus poisoning, to examine the renal secretion\r\nfor leucin and tyrosin, &c. Leucin may be found as a deposit in the\r\nurine. Its general appearance is that of little oval or round discs,\r\nlooking like drops of fat. It can be recognised by taking up one or more\r\nof these little bodies and placing them in the author’s subliming cell\r\n(see § 314). By careful heating it will sublime wholly on to the upper\r\ncover. On now adding a little nitric acid to the sublimed leucin, and\r\ndrying, and then to the dried residue adding a droplet of a solution of\r\nsodium hydrate, leucin forms an oily drop. Tyrosin also may occur as a\r\nsediment of little heaps of fine needles. The best test for tyrosin is\r\nto dissolve in hot water, and then add a drop of a solution of mercuric\r\nnitrate and mercurous nitrate, when a rose colour is at once developed,\r\nif the tyrosin is in very minute quantity; but if in more than traces,\r\nthere is a distinct crimson precipitate. To separate leucin and tyrosin\r\nfrom the urine, the best process is as follows:--The urine is filtered\r\nfrom any deposit, evaporated to a thin syrup, and decanted from the\r\nsecond deposit that forms. The two deposits are mixed together and\r\ntreated with dilute ammonia, which will dissolve out any tyrosin and\r\nleave it in needles, if the ammonia is spontaneously evaporated on a\r\nwatch-glass. The urine is then diluted and treated with neutral and\r\nbasic acetates of lead, filtered, and the lead thrown out of the\r\nfiltrate by hydric sulphide. The filtrate is evaporated to a syrup, and\r\nit then deposits leucin mixed with some tyrosin. If, however, the syrup\r\nrefuses to crystallise, it is treated with cold absolute alcohol, and\r\nfiltered, the residue is then boiled up with spirit of wine, which\r\nextracts leucin, and deposits it on cooling in a crystalline form. To\r\nobtain oxymandelic acid, the mother liquor, from which leucin and\r\ntyrosin have been extracted, is precipitated with absolute alcohol,\r\nfiltered, and then the alcoholic solution evaporated to a syrup. This\r\nsyrup is acidified by sulphuric acid, and extracted with ether; the\r\nether is filtered off and evaporated to dryness; the dry residue will be\r\nin the form of oily drops and crystals. The crystals are collected,\r\ndissolved in water, and the solution precipitated by lead acetate to\r\nremove colouring-matters; after filtration it is finally precipitated\r\nby basic acetate. On decomposition of the basic acetate, by suspending\r\nin water and saturating with hydric sulphide, the ultimate filtrate on\r\nevaporation deposits colourless, flexible needles of oxymandelic acid.\r\nThe nitrogenised acid which Schultzen and Riess obtained from urine in a\r\ncase of phosphorus poisoning, was found in an alcohol and ether\r\nextract--warts of rhombic scales separating out of the syrupy residue.\r\nThese scales gave no precipitate with basic acetate, but formed a\r\ncompound with silver nitrate. The silver compound was in the form of\r\nshining white needles, and contained 33·9 per cent. of silver; the acid\r\nwas decomposed by heat, and with lime yielded aniline. Its melting-point\r\nis given at from 184° to 185°. The occurrence of some volatile substance\r\nin phosphorus urine, which blackens nitrate of silver, and which is\r\nprobably phosphine, was first noticed by Selmi.[321] Pesci and Stroppa\r\nhave confirmed Selmi’s researches. It is even given off in the cold.\r\n\r\n[321] _Giornale Internaz. della Scienza Med._, 1879, Nro. 5, p. 645.\r\n\r\n§ 299. =The quantitative estimation of phosphorus= is best carried out\r\nby oxidising it into phosphoric acid, and estimating as ammon. magnesian\r\nphosphate. To effect this, the substances are distilled in an atmosphere\r\nof CO₂ into a flask with water, to which a tube containing silver\r\nnitrate is attached; the latter retains all phosphine, the former solid\r\nphosphorus. If necessary, the distillate may be again distilled into\r\nAgNO₃; and in any case the contents of the [U]-tube and flask are mixed,\r\noxidised with nitromuriatic acid, filtered from silver chloride, and the\r\nphosphoric acid determined in the usual way.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a child poisoned by lucifer matches, Sonnenschein\r\nestimated the free phosphorus in the following way:--The contents of the\r\nstomach were diluted with water, a measured part filtered, and the\r\nphosphoric acid estimated. The other portion was then oxidised by HCl\r\nand potassic chlorate, and the phosphoric acid estimated--the difference\r\nbeing calculated as free phosphorus.\r\n\r\n§ 300. =How long can Phosphorus be recognised after Death?=--One of the\r\nmost important matters for consideration is the time after death in\r\nwhich free phosphorus, or free phosphoric acids, can be detected. Any\r\nphosphorus changed into ammon. mag. phosphate, or into any other salt,\r\nis for medico-legal purposes entirely lost, since the expert can only\r\ntake cognisance of the substance either in a free state, as phosphine,\r\nor as a free acid.\r\n\r\nThe question, again, may be asked in court--Does the decomposition of\r\nanimal substances rich in phosphorus develop phosphine? The answer to\r\nthis is, that no such reaction has been observed.\r\n\r\nA case is related[322] in which phosphorus was recognised, although the\r\nbody had been buried for several weeks and then exhumed.\r\n\r\n[322] _Pharm. Zeitsch. f. Russl._, Jahrg. 2, p. 87.\r\n\r\nThe expert of pharmacy of the Provincial Government Board of Breslau has\r\nalso made some experiments in this direction, which are worthy of\r\nnote:--Four guinea-pigs were poisoned, each by 0·023 grm. of phosphorus;\r\nthey died in a few hours, and were buried in sandy-loam soil, 0·5 metre\r\ndeep. Exhumation of the first took place four weeks after. The\r\nputrefying organs--heart, liver, spleen, stomach, and all the\r\nintestines--tested by Mitscherlich’s method of distillation, showed\r\ncharacteristic phosphorescence for nearly one hour.\r\n\r\nThe second animal was exhumed after eight weeks in a highly putrescent\r\nstate. Its entrails, on distillation, showed the phosphorescent\r\nappearance for thirty-five minutes.\r\n\r\nThe third animal was taken from the earth after twelve weeks, but no\r\nfree phosphorus could be detected, although there was evidence of the\r\nlower form of oxidation (PO₃) by Blondlot’s method.\r\n\r\nThe fourth animal was exhumed after fifteen weeks, but neither free\r\nphosphorus nor PO₃ could be detected.[323]\r\n\r\n[323] _Vierteljahrsschrift für gerichtliche Medicin_, Jan. 7, 1876; see\r\nalso _Zeitschr. f. anal. Chemie_, 1872.\r\n\r\nA man, as well as a cat, was poisoned by phosphorus. On analysis,\r\ntwenty-nine days after death, negative results were alone\r\nobtained.--_Sonnenschein._\r\n\r\nIt will thus be evident that there is no constant rule, and that, even\r\nwhen decomposition is much advanced, an examination _may_ be\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART VI.--ALKALOIDS AND POISONOUS VEGETABLE PRINCIPLES SEPARATED FOR THE\r\nMOST PART BY ALCOHOLIC SOLVENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIVISION I.--VEGETABLE ALKALOIDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--General Methods of Testing and Extracting Alkaloids.\r\n\r\n§ 301. =General Tests for Alkaloids.=--In order to ascertain whether an\r\nalkaloid is present or not, a method of extraction must be pursued\r\nwhich, while disposing of fatty matters, salts, &c., shall dissolve as\r\nlittle as possible of foreign substances--such a method, _e.g._, as the\r\noriginal process of Stas, or one of its modern modifications.\r\n\r\nIf to the acid aqueous solution finally obtained by this method a dilute\r\nsolution of soda be added, drop by drop, until it is rendered feebly\r\nalkaline, _and no precipitate appear_, whatever other poisonous\r\nplant-constituents may be present, all ordinary alkaloids[324] are\r\nabsent.\r\n\r\n[324] In the case of morphine tartrate, this test will not answer. See\r\nthe article on Morphine.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this negative test, there are also a number of substances\r\nwhich give well-marked crystalline or amorphous precipitates with\r\nalkaloids.\r\n\r\n§ 302. These may be called “group reagents.” The chief members of the\r\ngroup-reagents are--Iodine dissolved in hydriodic acid, iodine dissolved\r\nin potassic iodide solution, bromine dissolved in potassic bromide\r\nsolution, hydrargo-potassic iodide, bismuth-potassic iodide, cadmic\r\npotassic iodide; the chlorides of gold, of platinum, and mercury; picric\r\nacid, gallic acid, tannin, chromate of potash, bichromate of potash,\r\nphospho-molybdic acid, phospho-tungstic acid, silico-tungstic acid, and\r\nFröhde’s reagent. It will be useful to make a few general remarks on\r\nsome of these reagents.\r\n\r\n=Iodine in hydriodic acid= gives either crystalline or amorphous\r\nprecipitates with nearly all alkaloids; the compound with morphine, for\r\nexample, is in very definite needles; with dilute solutions of\r\natropine, the precipitate is in the form of minute dots, but the\r\nmajority of the precipitates are amorphous, and all are more or less\r\ncoloured.\r\n\r\n=Iodine dissolved in a solution of potassic iodide= gives with alkaloids\r\na reddish or red-brown precipitate, and this in perhaps a greater\r\ndilution than almost any reagent. When added to an aqueous solution, the\r\nprecipitates are amorphous, but if added to an alcoholic solution,\r\ncertain alkaloids then form crystalline precipitates; this, for example,\r\nis the case with berberine and narceine. By treating the precipitate\r\nwith aqueous sulphurous acid, a sulphate of the alkaloid is formed and\r\nhydriodic acid, so that by suitable operations the alkaloid may readily\r\nbe recovered from this compound. A solution of bromine in potassic\r\nbromide solution also gives similar precipitates to the above, but it\r\nforms insoluble compounds with phenol, orcin, and other substances.\r\n\r\n=Mercuric potassic iodide= is prepared by decomposing mercuric chloride\r\nwith potassic iodide in excess. The proportions are 13·546 grms. of\r\nmercuric chloride and 49·8 of potassic iodide, and water sufficient to\r\nmeasure, when dissolved, 1 litre. The precipitates from this reagent are\r\nwhite and flocculent; many of them become, on standing, crystalline.\r\n\r\n=Bismuthic potassic iodide= in solution precipitates alkaloids, and the\r\ncompounds formed are of great insolubility, but it also forms compounds\r\nwith the various albuminoid bodies.\r\n\r\n=Chloride of gold= forms with the alkaloids compounds, many of which are\r\ncrystalline, and most admit of utilisation for quantitative\r\ndeterminations. Chloride of gold does not precipitate amides or ammonium\r\ncompounds, and on this account its value is great. The precipitates are\r\nyellow, and after a while are partly decomposed, when the colour is of a\r\nreddish-brown.\r\n\r\n=Platinic chloride= also forms precipitates with most of the alkaloids,\r\nbut since it also precipitates ammonia and potassic salts, it is\r\ninferior to gold chloride in utility.\r\n\r\n§ 303. (1.) =Phosphomolybdic Acid as a Reagent for\r\nAlkaloids.=--_Preparation_; Molybdate of ammonia is precipitated by\r\nphosphate of soda; and the well-washed yellow precipitate is suspended\r\nin water and warmed with carbonate of soda, until it is entirely\r\ndissolved. This solution is evaporated to dryness, and the ammonia fully\r\nexpelled by heating. If the molybdic acid is fairly reduced by this\r\nmeans, it is to be moistened by nitric acid, and the heating repeated.\r\nThe now dry residue is warmed with water, nitric acid added to strong\r\nacid reaction, and the mixture diluted with water, so that 10 parts of\r\nthe solution contain 1 of the dry salt. The precipitates of the\r\nalkaloids are as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Aniline,                 Bright-yellow, flocculent.\r\n  Morphine,                      „             „\r\n  Narcotine,               Brownish-yellow,    „\r\n  Quinine,                 Whitish-yellow,     „\r\n  Cinchonine,                    „             „\r\n  Codeine,                 Brownish-yellow, voluminous.\r\n  Strychnine,              White-yellow,        „\r\n  Brucine,                 Yelk-yellow, flocculent.\r\n  Veratrine,               Bright-yellow,    „\r\n  Jervine,                       „           „\r\n  Aconitine,                     „           „\r\n  Emetine,                       „           „\r\n  Theine,                  Bright-yellow, voluminous.\r\n  Theobromine,                   „             „\r\n  Solanine,                Citron-yellow, pulverulent.\r\n  Atropine,                Bright-yellow, flocculent.\r\n  Hyoscyamine,                   „             „\r\n  Colchicine,              Orange-yellow,      „\r\n  Delphinine,              Grey-yellow, voluminous.\r\n  Berberine,               Dirty-yellow, flocculent.\r\n  Coniine,                 Bright-yellow, voluminous.\r\n  Nicotine,                      „            „\r\n  Piperine,                Brownish-yellow, flocculent.\r\n\r\n(2.) =Silico-Tungstic Acid as a Reagent for Alkaloids.=--Sodium\r\ntungstate is boiled with freshly precipitated gelatinous silica. To the\r\nsolution is added mercurous nitrate, which precipitates the yellow\r\nmercurous silico-tungstate. This is filtered, well-washed, and\r\ndecomposed by an equivalent quantity of hydrochloric acid;\r\nsilico-tungstic acid then goes into solution, and mercurous chloride\r\n(calomel) remains behind. The clear filtrate is evaporated to drive off\r\nthe excess of hydrochloric acid, and furnishes, on spontaneous\r\nevaporation, large, shining, colourless octahedra of silico-tungstic\r\nacid, which effloresce in the air, melt at 36°, and are easily soluble\r\nin water or alcohol.\r\n\r\nThis agent produces no insoluble precipitate with any metallic salt.\r\nCæsium and rubidium salts, even in dilute solutions, are precipitated by\r\nit; neutral solutions of ammonium chloride give with it a white\r\nprecipitate, soluble with difficulty in large quantities of water. It\r\nprecipitates solutions of the salts of quinine, cinchonine, morphine,\r\natropine, &c.; if in extremely dilute solution, an opalescence only is\r\nproduced: for instance, it has been observed that cinchonine\r\nhydrochlorate in 1/200000, quinia hydrochlorate in 1/20000,\r\nmorphia hydrochlorate in 1/15285 dilution, all gave a distinct\r\nopalescence.--_Archiv der Pharm._, Nov., Dr. Richard Godeffroy.\r\n\r\n(3.) =Scheibler’s Method for Alkaloids: Phospho-Tungstic\r\nAcid.=--Ordinary commercial sodium tungstate is digested with half its\r\nweight of phosphoric acid, specific gravity 1·13, and the whole allowed\r\nto stand for some days, when the acid separates in crystals. A solution\r\nof these crystals will give a distinct precipitate with the most minute\r\nquantities of alkaloids, 1/200000 of strychnine, and 1/100000 of\r\nquinine. The alkaloid is liberated by digestion with barium hydrate (or\r\ncalcium hydrate); and if volatile, may be distilled off, if fixed,\r\ndissolved out by chloroform. In complex mixtures, colouring-matter may\r\nbe removed by plumbic acetate, the lead thrown out by SH₂, and\r\nconcentrated, so as to remove the excess of SH₂.\r\n\r\n§ 304. =Schulze’s reagent= is phospho-antimonic acid. It is prepared by\r\ndropping a strong solution of antimony trichloride into a saturated\r\nsolution of sodic phosphate. The precipitation of the alkaloids is\r\neffected by this reagent in a sulphuric acid solution.\r\n\r\n§ 305. =Dragendorff’s reagent= is a solution of potass-bismuth iodide;\r\nit is prepared by dissolving bismuth iodide in a hot solution of\r\npotassium iodide, and then diluting with an equal volume of iodide of\r\npotassium solution. On the addition of an acid solution of an alkaloid,\r\na kermes-red precipitate falls down, which is in many cases crystalline.\r\n\r\n=Marm’s reagent= is a solution of potass-cadmium iodide. It is made on\r\nsimilar principles.\r\n\r\n=Potass-zinc iodide= in solution is also made similarly. The\r\nprecipitates produced in solutions of narceine and codeine are\r\ncrystalline and very characteristic.\r\n\r\n§ 306. =Colour Tests.=--=Fröhde’s reagent= is made by dissolving 1 part\r\nof sodic molybdate in 10 parts of strong sulphuric acid; it strikes\r\ndistinctive colours with many alkaloids.\r\n\r\n=Mandelin’s reagent= is a solution of meta-vanadate of ammonia in mono-\r\nor dihydrated sulphuric acid. The strength should be 1 part of the salt\r\nto 200 of the acid. This reagent strikes a colour with many alkaloids,\r\nand aids to their identification. It is specially useful to supplement\r\nand correct other tests. The following table gives the chief colour\r\nreactions, with the alkaloids. (See also p. 55 for the spectroscopic\r\nappearances of certain of the colour tests.)\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF SEPARATION.\r\n\r\n§ 307. =Stas’s Process.=--The original method of Stas[325] (afterwards\r\nmodified by Otto)[326] consisted in extraction of the organic matters by\r\nstrong alcohol, with the addition of tartaric acid; the filtered\r\nsolution was then carefully neutralised with soda, and shaken up with\r\nether, the ethereal solution being separated by a pipette. Subsequent\r\nchemists proposed chloroform instead of ether,[327] the additional use\r\nof amyl-alcohol,[328] and the substitution of acetic, hydrochloric, and\r\nsulphuric for tartaric acid.\r\n\r\n[325] _Annal d.

Out of seventy-two alkaloids (using 0·5 mgrm.), the following\r\nalone gave characteristic colours when fused with KHO:--Quinine,\r\ngrass-green, and peculiar odour; quinidine, becoming yellower and\r\nfinally brown; cinchonine, at first brownish-red to violet, with green\r\nedges, later, bluish-green; cinchonidine, blue passing into grey;\r\ncocaine, greenish-yellow, turning to blue, and then dirty red on strong\r\nheating.--W.

of\r\nseparating alkaloids from an ethereal solution has been proposed by\r\nSelmi.[330] The alcoholic extract of the viscera, acidified and\r\nfiltered, is evaporated at 65°; the residue taken up with water,\r\nfiltered, and decolorised by basic acetate of lead. The lead is thrown\r\nout by sulphuretted hydrogen; the solution, after concentration,\r\nrepeatedly extracted with ether; and the ethereal solution saturated\r\nwith dry CO₂, which generally precipitates some of the alkaloids. The\r\nethereal solution is then poured into clean vessels, and mixed with\r\nabout half its volume of water, through which a current of CO₂ is passed\r\nfor twenty minutes; this may cause the precipitation of other alkaloids\r\nnot thrown down by dry CO₂. If the whole of the alkaloids are not\r\nobtained by these means, the solution is dehydrated by agitation with\r\nbarium oxide, and a solution of tartaric acid in ether is added (care\r\nbeing taken to avoid excess); this throws down any alkaloid still\r\npresent. The detection of any yet remaining in the viscera is effected\r\nby mixing with barium hydrate and a little water, and agitating with\r\n_purified_ amylic alcohol; from the alcohol the alkaloids may be\r\nsubsequently extracted by agitation with very dilute sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\n[330] F. Selmi, _Gazett. Chim. Ital._, vj. 153-166, and _Journ. Chem.\r\nSoc._, i., 1877, 93.\r\n\r\nAnother ingenious method (also the suggestion of Selmi) is to treat the\r\norganic substance with alcohol, to which a little sulphuric acid has\r\nbeen added, to filter, digest with alcohol, and refilter. The filtrates\r\nare united, evaporated down to a smaller bulk, filtered, concentrated to\r\na syrup, alkalised by barium hydrate, and, after the addition of freshly\r\nignited barium oxide and some powdered glass, exhausted with dry ether;\r\nthe ether filtered, the filtrate digested with lead hydrate; the\r\nethereal solution filtered, evaporated to dryness, and finally again\r\ntaken up with ether, which, this time, should leave on evaporation the\r\nalkaloid almost pure.\r\n\r\n§ 309. =Dragendorff’s Process.=--To Dragendorff we owe an elaborate\r\ngeneral method of separation, since it is applicable not only to\r\nalkaloids, but to glucosides, and other active principles derived from\r\nplants. His process is essentially a combination of those already known,\r\nand its distinctive features are the shaking up--(1) of the acid fluid\r\nwith the solvent, thus removing colouring matters and certain\r\nnon-alkaloidal principles; and (2) of the same fluid made alkaline. The\r\nfollowing is his method in full. It may be advantageously used when the\r\nanalyst has to search generally for vegetable poison, although it is, of\r\ncourse, far too elaborate for every case; and where, from any\r\ncircumstance, there is good ground for suspecting the presence of one or\r\ntwo particular alkaloids or poisons, the process may be much shortened\r\nand modified.[331]\r\n\r\n[331] Dragendorff’s _Gerichtlich-chemische Ermittelung von Giften_, St.\r\nPetersburg, 1876, p. 141.\r\n\r\nI. The substance, in as finely-divided form as possible, is digested for\r\na few hours in water acidified with sulphuric acid, at a temperature of\r\n40° to 50°, and this operation is repeated two or three times, with\r\nfiltering and pressing of the substances; later, the extracts are\r\nunited. This treatment (if the temperature mentioned is not exceeded)\r\ndoes not decompose the majority of alkaloids or other active substances;\r\nbut there are a few (_e.g._, solanine and colchicine) which would be\r\naltered by it; and, if such are suspected, maceration at the common\r\ntemperature is necessary, with substitution of acetic for sulphuric\r\nacid.[332]\r\n\r\n[332] When blood is to be examined, it is better to dry it, and then\r\npowder and extract with water acidified with dilute sulphuric acid.\r\nHowever, if the so-called volatile alkaloids are suspected, this\r\nmodification is to be omitted.\r\n\r\nII. The extract is next evaporated until it begins to be of a syrupy\r\nconsistence; the residue mixed with three to four times its volume of\r\nalcohol, macerated for twenty-four hours at about 34°, allowed to become\r\nquite cool, and filtered from the foreign matters which have separated.\r\nThe residue is washed with alcohol of 70 per cent.\r\n\r\nIII. The filtrate is freed from alcohol by distillation, the watery\r\nresidue poured into a capacious flask, diluted (if necessary) with\r\nwater, and filtered. Acid as it is, it is extracted at the common\r\ntemperature, with frequent shaking, by freshly-rectified petroleum\r\nether; and, after the fluids have again separated, the petroleum ether\r\nis removed, carrying with it certain impurities (colouring matter, &c.),\r\nwhich are in this way advantageously displaced. By this operation\r\nethereal oils, carbolic acid, picric acid, &c., which have not been\r\ndistilled, besides piperin, may also be separated. The shaking up with\r\npetroleum ether is repeated several times (as long as anything remains\r\nto be dissolved), and the products are evaporated on several\r\nwatch-glasses.\r\n\r\nRESIDUE OF PETROLEUM ETHER FROM THE ACID SOLUTION.\r\n\r\n  1.

THE WATERY FLUID IS NOW AGAIN SHAKEN UP WITH PETROLEUM ETHER,\r\n\r\nin order to take up the rest of the chloroform, and the watery fluid is\r\nsaturated with ammonia. The watery solution of _aconitine_ and _emetine_\r\nis liable to undergo, through free ammonia, a partial decomposition;\r\nbut, on the other hand, it is quite possible to obtain, with very small\r\nmixtures of the substances, satisfactory reactions, even out of\r\nammoniacal solutions.\r\n\r\nVII. THE AMMONIACAL WATERY FLUID WITH PETROLEUM ETHER.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier stages Dragendorff advises the shaking up with petroleum\r\nether at about 40°, and the removal of the ether as quickly as possible\r\nwhilst warm. This is with the intention of separating by this fluid\r\nstrychnine, brucine, emetine, quinine, veratrine, &c. Finding, however,\r\nthat a full extraction by petroleum ether is either difficult or not\r\npracticable, he prefers, as we have seen, to conclude the operation by\r\nother agents, coming back again upon the ether for certain special\r\ncases. Such are the volatile alkaloids; and here he recommends\r\ntreatment of the fluid by _cold_ petroleum ether, taking care _not_ to\r\nhasten the removal of the latter. Strychnine and other fixed alkaloids\r\nare then only taken up in small quantities, and the greater portion\r\nremains for the later treatment of the watery fluid by benzene.\r\n\r\nA portion of the petroleum ether, supposed to contain in solution\r\nvolatile alkaloids, is evaporated in two watch-glasses; to the one,\r\nstrong hydrochloric acid is added, the other being evaporated without\r\nthis agent. On the evaporation of the petroleum ether, it is seen\r\nwhether the first portion is crystalline or amorphous, or whether the\r\nsecond leaves behind a strongly-smelling fluid mass, which denotes a\r\nvolatile alkaloid. If the residue in both glasses is without odour and\r\nfixed, the absence of volatile acids and the presence of fixed\r\nalkaloids, strychnine, emetine, veratrine, &c., are indicated.\r\n\r\nTHE PETROLEUM ETHER RESIDUE FROM AMMONIACAL SOLUTION.\r\n\r\n  1.

THE AMMONIACAL SOLUTION IS SHAKEN UP WITH BENZENE.\r\n\r\nIn most cases petroleum ether, benzene, and chloroform are more easily\r\nseparated from acid watery fluids than from ammoniacal, benzene and\r\nchloroform causing here a difficulty which has perhaps deterred many\r\nfrom using this method. Dragendorff, however, maintains that he has\r\nnever examined a fluid in which he could not obtain a complete\r\nseparation of the benzene and water. If the upper benzene layer is fully\r\ngelatinous and emulsive, the under layer of water is to be removed with\r\na pipette as far as possible, and the benzene with a few drops of\r\nabsolute alcohol and filtration. As a rule, the water goes through first\r\nalone, and by the time the greater part has run through, the jelly in\r\nthe filter, by dint of stirring, has become separated from the benzene,\r\nand, finally, the jelly shrinks up to a minimum, and the clear benzene\r\nfilters off. Dragendorff filters mostly into a burette, from which\r\nultimately the benzene and the water are separated.\r\n\r\nThe principal alkaloids which are dissolved in benzene are--strychnine,\r\nmethyl and ethyl strychnine, brucine, emetine, quinine, cinchonine,\r\natropine, hyoscyamine, physostigmine, aconitine, nepalin, the alkaloid\r\nof the _Aconitum lycoctonum_, aconellin, napellin, delphinine,\r\nveratrine, sabatrin, sabadilline, codeine, thebaine, and narcotine.\r\n\r\nTHE BENZENE RESIDUE DERIVED FROM THE AMMONIACAL SOLUTION.\r\n\r\n  1.

A shorter process, recommended conditionally by Dragendorff, for\r\nbrucine, strychnine, quinine, cinchonine, and emetine, is as follows:--\r\n\r\nThe substance, if necessary, is finely divided, and treated with\r\nsulphuric acid (dilute) until it has a marked acid reaction. To every\r\n100 c.c. of the pulp (which has been diluted with distilled water to\r\nadmit of its being filtered later), at least 5 to 10 c.c. of diluted\r\nsulphuric acid (1 : 5) are added. It is digested at 50° for a few hours,\r\nfiltered, and the residue treated again with 100 c.c. of water at 50°.\r\nThis extract is, after a few hours, again filtered; both the filtrates\r\nare mixed and evaporated in the water-bath to almost the consistency of\r\na thin syrup. The fluid, however, must not be concentrated too much, or\r\nfully evaporated to dryness. The residue is now placed in a flask, and\r\ntreated with three to four times its volume of alcohol of 90 to 95 per\r\ncent.; the mixture is macerated for twenty-four hours, and then\r\nfiltered. The filtrate is distilled alcohol-free, or nearly so, but a\r\nsmall amount of alcohol remaining is not objectionable. The watery fluid\r\nis diluted to about 50 c.c., and treated with pure benzene; the mixture\r\nis shaken, and after a little time the benzene removed--an operation\r\nwhich is repeated. After the removal the second time of the benzene, the\r\nwatery fluid is made alkaline with ammonia, warmed to 40° or 50°, and\r\nthe free alkaloid extracted by twice shaking it up with two different\r\napplications of benzene. On evaporation of the latter, if the alkaloid\r\nis not left pure, it can be dissolved in acid, precipitated by ammonia,\r\nand again extracted by benzene.\r\n\r\n    § 311. =Scheibler’s Process=.--A method very different from those\r\n    just described is one practised by Scheibler. This is to precipitate\r\n    the phosphotungstate of the alkaloid, and then to liberate the\r\n    latter by digesting the precipitate with either hydrate of barium or\r\n    hydrate of calcium, dissolving it out by chloroform, or, if\r\n    volatile, by simple distillation. The convenience of Scheibler’s\r\n    process is great, and it admits of very general application. In\r\n    complex mixtures, it will usually be found best to precede the\r\n    addition of phosphotungstic acid[337] by that of acetate of lead, in\r\n    order to remove colouring matter, &c.; the excess of lead must in\r\n    its turn be thrown out by SH₂, and the excess of SH₂ be got rid of\r\n    by evaporation. Phosphotungstic acid is a very delicate test for the\r\n    alkaloids, giving a distinct precipitate with the most minute\r\n    quantities (1/200000 of strychnine and 1/100000 of quinine). A very\r\n    similar method is practised by Sonnenschein and others with the aid\r\n    of phospho-molybdic acid. The details of Scheibler’s process are as\r\n    follows:--\r\n\r\n[337] The method of preparing this reagent is as follows:--Ordinary\r\ncommercial sodium tungstate is treated with half its weight of\r\nphosphoric acid, specific gravity, 1·13, and then allowed to stand for\r\nsome days. Phosphotungstic acid separates in crystals.\r\n\r\n    The organic mixture is repeatedly extracted by water strongly\r\n    acidified with sulphuric acid; the extract is evaporated at 30° to\r\n    the consistence of a thin syrup; then diluted with water, and, after\r\n    several hours’ standing, filtered in a cool place. To the filtered\r\n    fluid phosphotungstic acid is added in excess, the precipitate\r\n    filtered, washed with water to which some phosphotungstic acid\r\n    solution has been added, and, whilst still moist, rinsed into a\r\n    flask. Caustic baryta or carbonate of potash is added to alkaline\r\n    reaction, and after the flask has been connected with bulbs\r\n    containing HCl, it is heated at first slowly, then more strongly.\r\n    Ammonia and any volatile alkaloids are driven over into the acid,\r\n    and are there fixed, and can be examined later by suitable methods.\r\n    The residue in the flask is carefully evaporated to dryness (the\r\n    excess of baryta having been precipitated by CO₂), and then\r\n    extracted by strong alcohol. On evaporation of the alcohol, the\r\n    alkaloid is generally sufficiently pure to be examined, or, if not\r\n    so, it may be obtained pure by re-solution, &c.\r\n\r\nThe author has had considerable experience of Scheibler’s process, and\r\nhas used it in precipitating various animal fluids, but has generally\r\nfound the precipitate bulky and difficult to manage.\r\n\r\n    § 312. =Grandval and Lajoux’s Method=.[338]--The alkaloids are\r\n    precipitated from a solution slightly acidified by hydrochloric or\r\n    sulphuric acid by a solution of hydrarg-potassium iodide. The\r\n    precipitate is collected on a filter, washed and then transferred to\r\n    a flask; drop by drop, a solution of sodium sulphide is added; after\r\n    each addition the suspended precipitate is shaken and allowed to\r\n    stand for a few minutes, and a drop of the liquid taken out and\r\n    tested with lead acetate; directly a slight brown colour appears,\r\n    sufficient sodic sulphide has been added. The liquid is now left for\r\n    half-an-hour, with occasional shaking. Then sulphuric acid is added\r\n    until it is just acid, and the liquid is filtered and the mercury\r\n    sulphide well washed. In the filtrate will be the sulphate of any\r\n    alkaloid in solution; this liquid is now made alkaline with soda\r\n    carbonate and shaken up, as in Dragendorff’s process, with\r\n    appropriate solvents; such, for example, as ether, or chloroform, or\r\n    acetone, or amylic alcohol, according to the particular alkaloid the\r\n    analyst is searching for, and the solvent finally separated and\r\n    allowed to evaporate, when the alkaloid is found in the residue.\r\n\r\n[338] “Dosage des alcaloides à l’aide de l’iodure double de mercure et\r\nde potassium,” par MM. A. Grandval et Henri Lajoux, _Journ. de\r\nPharmacie_, 5 sér. t. xxviii. 152-156.\r\n\r\n    § 313. =Identification of the Alkaloids=.--Having obtained, in one\r\n    way or other, a crystalline or amorphous substance, supposed to be\r\n    an alkaloid, or, at all events, an active vegetable principle, the\r\n    next step is to identify it. If the tests given in Dragendorff’s\r\n    process have been applied, the observer will have already gone a\r\n    good way towards the identification of the substance; but it is, of\r\n    course, dangerous to trust to one reaction.\r\n\r\n    In medico-legal researches there is seldom any considerable quantity\r\n    of the material to work upon. Hence the greatest care must be taken\r\n    from the commencement not to waste the substance in useless tests,\r\n    but to study well at the outset what--by the method of extraction\r\n    used, the microscopic appearance, the reaction to litmus paper, and\r\n    the solubility in different menstrua--it is likely to be. However\r\n    minute the quantity may be, it is essential to divide it into\r\n    different parts, in order to apply a variety of tests; but as any\r\n    attempt to do this on the solid substance will probably entail loss,\r\n    the best way is to dissolve it in a watch-glass in half a c.c. of\r\n    alcohol, ether, or other suitable solvent. Droplets of this solution\r\n    are then placed on watch-glasses or slips of microscopic glass, and\r\n    to these drops, by the aid of a glass rod, different reagents can be\r\n    applied, and the changes watched under the microscope as the drops\r\n    slowly evaporate.\r\n\r\n§ 314. =Sublimation of the Alkaloids.=--A very beautiful and elegant aid\r\nto the identification of alkaloids, and vegetable principles generally,\r\nis their behaviour towards heat.\r\n\r\nAlkaloids, glucosides, the organic acids, &c., when carefully heated,\r\neither--(1) sublime wholly without decomposition (like theine, cytisin,\r\nand others); or (2) partially sublime with decomposition; or (3) are\r\nchanged into new bodies (as, for example, gallic acid); or (4) melt and\r\nthen char; or (5) simply char and burn away.\r\n\r\nMany of these phenomena are striking and characteristic, taking place at\r\ndifferent temperatures, subliming in characteristic forms, or leaving\r\ncharacteristic residues.\r\n\r\nOne of the first to employ sublimation systematically, as a means of\r\nrecognition of the alkaloids, &c., was Helwig.[339] His method was to\r\nplace a small quantity (from ½ to 1/4000 of a mgrm.) in a depression on\r\nplatinum foil, cover it with a slip of glass, and then carefully heat by\r\na small flame. After Helwig, Dr. Guy[340] greatly improved the process\r\nby using porcelain discs, and more especially by the adoption of a\r\nconvenient apparatus, which may be termed “the subliming cell.” It is\r\nessentially composed of a ring of glass from ⅛ to ⅔ of an inch in\r\nthickness, such as may be obtained by sections of tubing, the cut\r\nsurfaces being ground perfectly smooth. This circle is converted into a\r\nclosed cell by resting it on one of the ordinary thin discs of glass\r\nused as a covering for microscopic purposes, and supporting a similar\r\ndisc. The cell was placed on a brass plate, provided with a nipple,\r\nwhich carried a thermometer, and was heated by a small flame applied\r\nmidway between the thermometer and the cell; the heat was raised very\r\ngradually, and the temperature at which any change took place was noted.\r\nIn this way Dr. Guy made determinations of the subliming points of a\r\nlarge number of substances, and the microscopic appearances of the\r\nsublimates were described with the greatest fidelity and accuracy. On\r\nrepeating with care Dr. Guy’s determinations, however, I could in no\r\nsingle instance agree with his subliming points, nor with the apparatus\r\nhe figures and describes could two consecutive observations exactly\r\ncoincide. Further, on examining the various subliming temperatures of\r\nsubstances, as stated by different authors, the widest discrepancies\r\nwere found--differences of 2 or even 3 degrees might be referred to\r\nerrors of observation, a want of exact coincidence in the thermometers\r\nemployed, and the like; but to what, for example, can we ascribe the\r\nirreconcilable statements which have been made with regard to theine?\r\nAccording to Strauch, this substance sublimes at 177°; according to\r\nMulder, at 184·7°. But that both of these observations deviate more than\r\n70° from the truth may be proved by any one who cares to place a few\r\nmgrms. of theine, enclosed between two watch-glasses, over the\r\nwater-bath; in a few minutes a distinct sublimate will condense on the\r\nupper glass, and, in point of fact, theine will be found to sublime\r\nseveral degrees below 100°.\r\n\r\n[339] _Das Mikroskop in der Toxicologie_.\r\n\r\n[340] _Pharm. Journ. Trans_. (2), viij. 719; ix. 10, 58. _Forensic\r\nMedicine_, London, 1875.\r\n\r\nSince this great divergency of opinion is not found either in the\r\nspecific gravity, or the boiling-points, or any of the like\r\ndeterminations of the physical properties of a substance, it is\r\nself-evident that the processes hitherto used for the determination of\r\nsubliming points are faulty. The sources of error are chiefly--\r\n\r\n(1.) Defects in the apparatus employed--the temperature read being\r\nrather that of the metallic surface in the immediate vicinity of the\r\nthermometer than of the substance itself.\r\n\r\n(2.) The want of agreement among observers as to what should be called a\r\nsublimate--one considering a sublimate only that which is evident to the\r\nnaked eye, another taking cognisance of the earliest microscopic film.\r\n\r\n(3.) No two persons employing the same process.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the apparatus employed, I adopt Dr. Guy’s subliming cell;\r\nbut the cell, instead of resting on a metallic solid, floats on a\r\nmetallic fluid. For any temperature a little above 100° this fluid is\r\nmercury, but for higher temperatures fusible metal is preferable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUBLIMING CELL.]\r\n\r\nThe exact procedure is as follows:--A porcelain crucible (_a_ in fig.),\r\nabout 3 inches in diameter, is nearly filled with mercury or fusible\r\nmetal, as the case may be; a minute speck (or two or three crystals of\r\nthe substance to be examined) is placed on a thin disc of microscopic\r\ncovering glass, floated on the liquid, and the cell is completed by the\r\nglass ring and upper disc. The porcelain crucible is supported on a\r\nbrass plate (_b_), fixed to a retort-stand in the usual way, and\r\nprotected from the unequal cooling effects of currents of air by being\r\ncovered by a flask (_c_), from which the bottom has been removed. The\r\nneck of the flask conveniently supports a thermometer, which passes\r\nthrough a cork, and the bulb of the thermometer is immersed in the bath\r\nof liquid metal. In the first examination of a substance the temperature\r\nis raised somewhat rapidly, taking off the upper disc with a forceps at\r\nevery 10° and exchanging it for a fresh disc, until the substance is\r\ndestroyed. The second examination is conducted much more slowly, and the\r\ndiscs exchanged at every 4° or 5°, whilst the final determination is\r\neffected by raising the temperature with great caution, and exchanging\r\nthe discs at about the points of change (already partially determined)\r\nat every half degree. All the discs are examined microscopically. The\r\nmost convenient definition of a sublimate is this--the most minute\r\nfilms, dots, or crystals, which can be observed by ¼-inch power, and\r\nwhich are obtained by keeping the subliming cell at a definite\r\ntemperature for 60 seconds. The commencement of many sublimates assumes\r\nthe shape of dots of extraordinary minuteness, quite invisible to the\r\nunaided eye; and, on the other hand, since the practical value of\r\nsublimation is mainly as an aid to other methods for the recognition of\r\nsubstances, if we go beyond _short_ intervals of time, the operation,\r\notherwise simple and speedy, becomes cumbersome, and loses its general\r\napplicability.\r\n\r\nThere is also considerable discrepancy of statement with regard to the\r\nmelting-point of alkaloidal bodies; in many instances a viscous state\r\nintervenes before the final complete resolution into fluid, and one\r\nobserver will consider the viscous state, the other complete fluidity,\r\nas the melting-point.\r\n\r\nIn the melting-points given below, the same apparatus was used, but the\r\nsubstance was simply placed on a thin disc of glass floating on the\r\nmetallic bath before described (the cell not being completed), and\r\nexamined from time to time microscopically, for by this means alone can\r\nthe first drops formed by the most minute and closely-adherent crystals\r\nto the glass be discovered.\r\n\r\n=Cocaine= melts at 93°, and gives a faint sublimate at 98°; if put\r\nbetween two watch-glasses on the water-bath, in fifteen minutes there is\r\na good cloud on the upper glass.\r\n\r\n=Aconitine= turns brown, and melts at 179° C.; it gives no\r\ncharacteristic sublimate up to 190°.\r\n\r\n=Morphine=, at 150°, clouds the upper disc with nebulæ; the nebulæ are\r\nresolved by high magnifying powers into minute dots; these dots\r\ngradually become coarser, and are generally converted into crystals at\r\n188°; the alkaloid browns at or about 200°.\r\n\r\n=Thebaine= sublimes in theine-like crystals at 135°; at higher\r\ntemperatures (160° to 200°), needles, cubes, and prisms are observed.\r\nThe residue on the lower disc, if examined before carbonisation, is\r\nfawn-coloured with non-characteristic spots.\r\n\r\n=Narcotine= gives no sublimate; it melts at 155° into a yellow liquid,\r\nwhich, on raising the temperature, ever becomes browner to final\r\nblackness. On examining the residue before carbonisation, it is a rich\r\nbrown amorphous substance; but if narcotine be heated two or three\r\ndegrees above its melting-point, and then cooled slowly, the residue is\r\ncrystalline--long, fine needles radiating from centres being common.\r\n\r\n=Narceine= gives no sublimate; it melts at 134° into a colourless\r\nliquid, which undergoes at higher temperatures the usual transition of\r\nbrown colours. The substance, heated a few degrees above its\r\nmelting-point, and then allowed to cool slowly, shows a straw-coloured\r\nresidue, divided into lobes or drops containing feathery crystals.\r\n\r\n=Papaverine= gives no sublimate; it melts at 130°. The residue, heated a\r\nlittle above its melting-point, and then slowly cooled, is amorphous, of\r\na light-brown colour, and in no way characteristic.\r\n\r\n=Hyoscyamine= gives no crystalline sublimate; it melts at 89°, and\r\nappears to volatilise in great part without decomposition. It melts into\r\nan almost colourless fluid, which, when solid, may exhibit a network not\r\nunlike vegetable parenchyma; on moistening the network with water,\r\ninterlacing crystals immediately appear. If, however, hyoscyamine be\r\nkept at 94° to 95° for a few minutes, and then slowly cooled, the edges\r\nof the spots are arborescent, and the spots themselves crystalline.\r\n\r\n=Atropine= (daturine) melts at 97°; at 123° a faint mist appears on the\r\nupper disc. Crystals cannot be obtained; the residue is not\r\ncharacteristic.\r\n\r\n=Solanine.=--The upper disc is dimmed with nebulæ at 190°, which are\r\ncoarser and more distinct at higher temperatures; at 200° it begins to\r\nbrown, and then melts; the residue consists of amber-brown,\r\nnon-characteristic drops.\r\n\r\n=Strychnine= gives a minute sublimate of fine needles, often disposed in\r\nlines, at 169°; about 221° it melts, the residue (at that temperature)\r\nis resinous.\r\n\r\n=Brucine= melts at 151° into a pale yellow liquid, at higher\r\ntemperatures becoming deep-brown. If the lower disc, after melting, be\r\nexamined, no crystals are observed, the residue being quite transparent,\r\nwith branching lines like the twigs of a leafless tree; light mists,\r\nproduced rather by decomposition than by true sublimation, condense on\r\nthe upper disc at 185°, and above.\r\n\r\n=Saponin= neither melts nor sublimes; it begins to brown about 145°, is\r\nalmost black at 185°, and quite so at 190°.\r\n\r\n=Delphinine= begins to brown about 102°; it becomes amber at 119°, and\r\nmelts, and bubbles appear. There is no crystalline sublimate; residue\r\nnot characteristic.\r\n\r\n=Pilocarpine= gives a distinct crystalline sublimate at 153°; but thin\r\nmists, consisting of fine dots, may be observed as low as 140°.\r\nPilocarpine melts at 159°; the sublimates at 160° to 170° are in light\r\nyellow drops. If these drops are treated with water, and the water\r\nevaporated, feathery crystals are obtained; the residue is resinous.\r\n\r\n=Theine= wholly sublimes; the first sublimate is minute dots, at 79°; at\r\nhalf a degree above that very small crystals may be obtained; and at\r\nsuch a temperature as 120°, the crystals are often long and silky.\r\n\r\n=Theobromine= likewise wholly sublimes; nebulæ at 134°, crystals at\r\n170°, and above.\r\n\r\n=Salicin= melts at 170°; it gives no crystalline sublimate. The melted\r\nmass remains up to 180° almost perfectly colourless; above that\r\ntemperature browning is evident. The residue is not characteristic.\r\n\r\n=Picrotoxin= gives no crystalline sublimate. The lowest temperature at\r\nwhich it sublimes is 128°; the usual nebulæ then make their appearance;\r\nbetween 165° and 170° there is slight browning; at 170° it melts. The\r\nresidue, slowly cooled, is not characteristic.\r\n\r\n=Cantharidin= sublimes very scantily between 82° and 83°; at 85° the\r\nsublimate is copious.\r\n\r\nThe active principles of plants may, in regard to their behaviour to\r\nheat, be classed for practical purposes into--\r\n\r\n  1. Those which give a decided crystalline sublimate:\r\n     (_a._) Below 100°, _e.g._, cocaine, theine, thebaine, cantharidin.\r\n     (_b._) Between 100° and 150°, _e.g._, quinetum.\r\n     (_c._) Between 150° and 200°, _e.g._, strychnine, morphine,\r\n            pilocarpine.\r\n  2. Those which melt, but give no crystalline sublimate:\r\n     (_a._) Below 100°, _e.g._, hyoscyamine, atropine.\r\n     (_b._) Between 100° and 150°, _e.g._, papaverine.\r\n     (_c._) Between 150° and 200°, _e.g._, salicin.\r\n     (_d._) Above 200°, _e.g._, solanine.\r\n  3. Those which neither melt nor give a crystalline sublimate, _e.g._,\r\n     saponin.\r\n\r\n§ 315. =Melting-point.=--The method of sublimation just given also\r\ndetermines the melting-point; such a determination will, however, seldom\r\ncompare with the melting-points of the various alkaloids as given in\r\ntext-books, because the latter melting-points are not determined in the\r\nsame way. The usual method of determining melting-points is to place a\r\nvery small quantity in a glass tube closed at one end; the tube should\r\nbe almost capillary. The tube is fastened to a thermometer by means of\r\nplatinum wire, and then the bulb of the thermometer, with its attached\r\ntube, is immersed in strong sulphuric acid or paraffin, contained in a\r\nflask. The thermometer should be suspended midway in the liquid and heat\r\ncarefully applied, so as to raise the temperature gradually and equably.\r\nIt will be found that rapidly raising the heat gives a different\r\nmelting-point to that which is obtained by slowly raising the heat.\r\nDuring the process careful watching is necessary: most substances change\r\nin hue before they actually melt. A constant melting-point, however\r\noften a substance is purified by recrystallisation, is a sign of purity.\r\n\r\n§ 316. =Identification by Organic Analysis.=--In a few cases (and in a\r\nfew only) the analyst may have sufficient material at hand to make an\r\norganic analysis, either as a means of identification or to confirm\r\nother tests. By the vacuum process described in “Foods,” in which carbon\r\nand nitrogen are determined by measuring the gases evolved by burning\r\nthe organic substance in as complete a vacuum as can be obtained, very\r\nminute quantities of a substance can be dealt with, and the carbon and\r\nnitrogen determined with fair accuracy. It is found in practice that the\r\ncarbon determinations appear more reliable than those of the nitrogen,\r\nand there are obvious reasons why this should be so.\r\n\r\nTheoretically, with the improved gas-measuring appliances, it is\r\npossible to measure a c.c. of gas; but few chemists would care to create\r\na formula on less than 10 c.c. of CO₂. Now, since 10 c.c. of CO₂ is\r\nequal to 6·33 mgrms. of carbon, and alkaloids average at least half\r\ntheir weight of carbon, it follows that 12 mgrms. of alkaloid represent\r\nabout the smallest quantity with which a reliable single combustion can\r\nbe made.\r\n\r\nThe following table gives a considerable number of the alkaloids and\r\nalkaloidal bodies, arranged according to their content in carbon:--\r\n\r\nTABLE SHOWING THE CONTENT OF CARBON AND NITROGEN IN VARIOUS ALKALOIDAL\r\nBODIES.\r\n\r\n                              Carbon.

One of the most convenient\r\nof these is titration with normal or decinormal sulphuric acid, a method\r\napplicable to a few alkaloids of marked basic powers--_e.g._, quinine is\r\nreadily and with accuracy estimated in this way, the alkaloid being\r\ndissolved in a known volume of the acid, and then titrated back with\r\nsoda. If a large number of observations are to be made, an acid may be\r\nprepared so that each c.c. equals 1 mgrm. of quinine. A reagent of\r\ngeneral application is found in the so-called _Mayer’s reagent_, which\r\nconsists of 13·546 grms. of mercuric chloride, and 49·8 grms. of iodide\r\nof potassium in a litre of water. Each c.c. of such solution\r\nprecipitates--\r\n\r\n  Of Strychnine,   ·0167  grm.\r\n   „ Brucine,      ·0233   „\r\n   „ Quinine,      ·0108   „\r\n   „ Cinchonine,   ·0102   „\r\n   „ Quinidine,    ·0120   „\r\n   „ Atropine,     ·0145   „\r\n   „ Aconitine,    ·0268   „\r\n   „ Veratrine,    ·0269   „\r\n   „ Morphine,     ·0200   „\r\n   „ Narcotine,    ·0213   „\r\n   „ Nicotine,     ·00405  „\r\n   „ Coniine,      ·00416  „\r\n\r\nThe final reaction is found by filtering, from time to time, a drop on\r\nto a glass plate, resting on a blackened surface, and adding the test\r\nuntil no precipitate appears. The results are only accurate when the\r\nstrength of the solution of the alkaloid is about 1 : 200; so that it is\r\nabsolutely necessary first to ascertain approximatively the amount\r\npresent, and then to dilute or concentrate, as the case may be, until\r\nthe proportion mentioned is obtained.\r\n\r\nA convenient method of obtaining the sulphate of an alkaloid for\r\nquantitative purposes, and especially from organic fluids, is that\r\nrecommended by Wagner. The fluid is acidulated with sulphuric acid, and\r\nthe alkaloid precipitated by a solution of iodine in iodide of\r\npotassium. The precipitate is collected and dissolved in an aqueous\r\nsolution of hyposulphite of soda. The filtered solution is again\r\nprecipitated with the iodine reagent, and the precipitate dissolved in\r\nsulphurous acid, which, on evaporation, leaves behind the pure sulphate\r\nof the base.\r\n\r\nIt is also very useful for quantitative purposes to combine an alkaloid\r\nwith gold or platinum, by treating the solution with the chlorides of\r\neither of those metals--the rule as to selection being to give that\r\nmetal the preference which yields the most insoluble and the most\r\ncrystallisable compound.\r\n\r\nThe following table gives the percentage of gold or platinum left on\r\nignition of the double salt:--\r\n\r\n                          Gold.

THE ALKALOIDS OF HEMLOCK (CONIUM).\r\n\r\n§ 318. The _Conium maculatum_, or spotted hemlock, is a rather common\r\numbelliferous plant, growing in waste places, and flowering from about\r\nthe beginning of June to August. The stem is from three to five feet\r\nhigh, smooth, branched, and spotted with purple; the leaflets of the\r\npartial involucres are unilateral, ovate, lanceolate, with an attenuate\r\npoint shorter than the umbels; the seeds are destitute of vittæ, and\r\nhave five prominent crenate wavy ridges. The whole plant is fœtid and\r\npoisonous. Conium owes its active properties to a volatile liquid\r\nalkaloid, _Coniine_, united with a crystalline alkaloid, _Conhydrine_.\r\n\r\n§ 319. =Coniine= (=conia=, =conicine=), (C₈H₁₇N)--specific gravity 0·862\r\nat 0°; melting-point, -2·5°; boiling-point, 166·6°. Pure coniine has\r\nbeen prepared synthetically by Ladenburg, and found to be\r\npropyl-piperidine C₅H₁₀NC₃H₇, but the synthetically-prepared piperidine\r\nhas no action on polarised light. By uniting it with dextro-tartaric\r\nacid, and evaporating, it is possible to separate the substance into\r\ndextro-propyl-piperidine and lævo-propyl-piperidine. The former is in\r\nevery respect identical with coniine from hemlock; it is a clear, oily\r\nfluid, possessing a peculiarly unpleasant, mousey odour. One part is\r\nsoluble in 150 parts of water,[341] in 6 parts of ether, and in almost\r\nall proportions of amyl alcohol, chloroform, and benzene. It readily\r\nvolatilises, and, provided air is excluded, may be distilled unchanged.\r\nIt ignites easily, and burns with a smoky flame. It acts as a strong\r\nbase, precipitating the oxides of metals and alkaline earths from their\r\nsolutions, and it coagulates albumen. Coniine forms salts with\r\nhydrochloric acid (C₈H₁₅N.HCl), phosphoric acid, iodic acid, and oxalic\r\nacid, which are in well-marked crystals. The sulphate, nitrate, acetate,\r\nand tartrate are, on the other hand, non-crystalline.\r\n\r\n[341] The saturated watery solution of coniine at 15°, becomes cloudy if\r\ngently warmed, and clears again on cooling.\r\n\r\nIf coniine is oxidised with nitric acid, or bichromate of potash, and\r\ndiluted sulphuric acid, butyric acid is formed; and since the latter has\r\nan unmistakable odour, and other characteristic properties, it has been\r\nproposed as a test for coniine. This may be conveniently performed\r\nthus:--A crystal of potassic bichromate is put at the bottom of a\r\ntest-tube, and some diluted sulphuric acid with a drop of the supposed\r\nconiine added. On heating, the butyric acid reveals itself by its odour,\r\nand can be distilled into baryta water, the butyrate of baryta being\r\nsubsequently separated in the usual way, and decomposed by sulphuric\r\nacid, &c.\r\n\r\nAnother test for coniine is the following:--If dropped into a solution\r\nof alloxan, the latter is coloured after a few minutes an intense\r\npurple-red, and white needle-shaped crystals are separated, which\r\ndissolve in cold potash-lye into a beautiful purple-blue, and emit an\r\nodour of the base.[342] Dry hydrochloric acid gives a purple-red, then\r\nan indigo-blue colour, with coniine; but if the acid is not dry, there\r\nis formed a bluish-green crystalline mass. This test, however, is of\r\nlittle value to the toxicologist, the pure substance alone responding\r\nwith any definite result.\r\n\r\n[342] Schwarzenbach, _Vierteljahrsschr. f. prakt. Pharm._, viij. 170.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary precipitating agents, according to Dragendorff, act as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n  Potass bismuth iodide.\r\n    1 : 2000, a strong orange precipitate.\r\n    1 : 3000. The drop of the reagent is surrounded with a muddy border.\r\n    1 : 4000. The drop of the reagent is surrounded with a muddy border.\r\n    1 : 5000, still perceptible.\r\n    1 : 6000. The last limit of the reaction.\r\n\r\nPhosphomolybdic acid gives a strong yellow precipitate; limit, 1 : 5000.\r\n\r\nPotass. mercuric iodide gives a cheesy precipitate; limit, 1 : 1000 in\r\nneutral, 1 : 800 in acid, solutions.\r\n\r\nPotass. cadmic iodide gives an amorphous precipitate, 1 : 300. The\r\nprecipitate is soluble in excess of the precipitant. (Nicotine, under\r\nsimilar circumstances, gives a crystalline precipitate.)\r\n\r\nFlückiger recommends the following reaction:[343]--“Add to 10 drops of\r\nether in a shallow glass crystallising dish 2 drops of coniine, and\r\ncover with filter paper. Set upon the paper a common-sized watch-glass\r\ncontaining bromine water, and invert a beaker over the whole\r\narrangement. Needle-shaped crystals of coniine hydro-bromine soon form\r\nin the dish as well as in the watch-glass.” Hydrochloric acid, used in\r\nthe same way, instead of bromine water, forms with coniine microscopic\r\nneedles of coniine hydrochlorate; both the hydro-bromide and the\r\nhydrochlorate doubly refract light. Nicotine does not respond to this\r\nreaction.\r\n\r\n[343] _Reactions_, by F. A. Flückiger, Detroit, 1893.\r\n\r\nConiine forms with carbon disulphide a thiosulphate and a sulphite. If\r\ncarbon disulphide, therefore, be shaken with an aqueous solution of\r\nconiine, the watery solution gives a brown precipitate with copper\r\nsulphate, colours ferric chloride solution dark brown red, and gives a\r\nmilky opalescence with dilute acids. If coniine itself is added to\r\ncarbon disulphide, there is evolution of heat, separation of sulphur,\r\nand formation of thiosulphate. Nicotine does not respond to this\r\nreaction.\r\n\r\n§ 320. =Other Coniine Bases.=--Methyl- and ethyl-coniine have been\r\nprepared synthetically, and are both similar in action to coniine, but\r\nsomewhat more like curarine. By the reduction of coniine with zinc dust\r\nconyrine (C₈H₁₁N) is formed; between coniine and conyrine stands\r\nconiceine (C₈H₁₅NO). De Coninck has made synthetically by the addition\r\nof 6 atoms of hydrogen to β collidine, a new fluid alkaloid (C₈H₁₁N + 6H\r\n= C₈H₁₇N), which he has called _isocicutine_: it has the same formula as\r\nconiine. Paraconiine Schiff prepared synthetically from ammonia and\r\nnormal butyl aldehyde; it has the formula C₈H₁₅N, and therefore differs\r\nfrom coniine in containing two atoms less of hydrogen. All the above\r\nhave a similar physiological action to coniine. α-stillbazoline\r\n(C₁₁H₁₉N), prepared by Baurath from benzaldehyde and picoline, is\r\nanalogous to coniine, and according to Falck has similar action, but is\r\nmore powerful.\r\n\r\n§ 321. =Pharmaceutical Preparations.=--The percentage of coniine in the\r\nplant itself, and in pharmaceutical preparations, can be approximately\r\ndetermined by distilling the coniine over, in a partial vacuum,[344]\r\nand titrating the distillate with Mayer’s reagent, each c.c. = about\r\n·00416 grm. of coniine. It appears to be necessary to add powdered\r\npotassic chloride and a small quantity of diluted sulphuric acid before\r\ntitrating, or the precipitate does not separate. In any case, the end of\r\nthe reaction is difficult to observe.[345]\r\n\r\n[344] This is easily effected by uniting a flask containing the\r\nalkaloidal fluid, air-tight, with a Liebig’s condenser and a receiver,\r\nthe latter being connected with Bunsen’s water-pump, or one of the\r\nnumerous exhausting apparatuses now in use in every laboratory.\r\n\r\n[345] Dragendorff, _Die Chemische Werthbestimmung einiger starkwirkender\r\nDroguen_, St. Petersb., 1874.\r\n\r\nThe fresh plant is said to contain from about ·04 to ·09 per cent., and\r\nthe fruit about 0·7 per cent. of coniine.\r\n\r\nThe officinal preparations are--the leaves, the fruit, a tincture of the\r\nfruit, an extract of the leaves, the juice of the leaves (_Succus\r\nconii_), a compound hemlock pill (composed of extract of hemlock,\r\nipecacuanha, and treacle), an inhalation of coniine (_Vapor conii_), and\r\na poultice (_Cataplasma conii_) made with the leaves.\r\n\r\n§ 322. =Statistics of Coniine Poisoning.=--F. A. Falck[346] has been\r\nable to collect 17 cases of death recorded in medical literature, up to\r\nthe year 1880, from either coniine or hemlock. Two of these cases were\r\ncriminal (murders), 1 suicidal, 2 cases in which coniine had been used\r\nmedicinally (in one instance the extract had been applied to a cancerous\r\nbreast; in the other, death was produced from the injection of an\r\ninfusion of hemlock leaves). The remaining 12 were cases in which the\r\nroot, leaves, or other portions of the plant had been ignorantly or\r\naccidentally eaten.\r\n\r\n[346] _Prakt. Toxicologie_, p. 273.\r\n\r\n§ 323. =Effects on Animals.=--It destroys all forms of animal life. The\r\nauthor made some years ago an investigation as to its action on the\r\ncommon blow-fly. Droplets of coniine were applied to various parts of\r\nblow-flies, which were then placed under glass shades. The symptoms\r\nbegan within a minute by signs of external irritation, there were rapid\r\nmotions of the wings, and quick and aimless movements of the legs.\r\nTorpor set in speedily, the buzz soon ceased, and the insects lay on\r\ntheir sides, motionless, but for occasional twitching of the legs. The\r\nwings, as a rule, became completely paralysed before the legs, and death\r\noccurred at a rather variable time, from ten minutes to two hours. If\r\nplaced in a current of air in the sun, a fly completely under the\r\ninfluence of coniine may recover. Coniine causes in frogs, similar to\r\ncurarine, peripheral paralysis of the motor nerves, combined with a\r\ntransitory stimulation, and afterwards a paralysis of the motor centres;\r\nin frogs the paralysis is not preceded by convulsions. Dragendorff\r\nexperimented on the action of coniine when given to five cats, the\r\nquantities used being ·05 to ·5 grm. The symptoms came on almost\r\nimmediately, but with the smaller dose given to a large cat, no effect\r\nwas witnessed until twenty-five minutes afterwards; this was the longest\r\ninterval. One of the earliest phenomena was dilatation of the pupil,\r\nfollowed by weakness of the limbs passing into paralysis, the hinder\r\nlegs being affected prior to the fore. The respiration became troubled,\r\nand the frequency of the breathing diminished; the heart in each case\r\nacted irregularly, and the sensation generally was blunted; death was\r\npreceded by convulsions. In the cases in which the larger dose of ·4 to\r\n·5 grm. was administered, death took place within the hour, one animal\r\ndying in eight minutes, a second in eighteen minutes, a third in twenty\r\nminutes, and a fourth in fifty-eight minutes. With the smaller dose of\r\n·051 grm. given to a large cat, death did not take place until eight\r\nhours and forty-seven minutes after administration.\r\n\r\n§ 324. =Effects on Man.=--In a case recorded by Bennet,[347] and quoted\r\nin most works on forensic medicine, the symptoms were those of general\r\nmuscular weakness deepening into paralysis. The patient had eaten\r\nhemlock in mistake for parsley; in about twenty minutes he experienced\r\nweakness in the lower extremities, and staggered in walking like a\r\ndrunken man; within two hours there was perfect paralysis of both upper\r\nand lower extremities, and he died in three and a quarter hours. In\r\nanother case, related by Taylor, the symptoms were also mainly those of\r\nparalysis, and in other instances stupor, coma, and slight convulsions\r\nhave been noted.\r\n\r\n[347] _Edin. Med. and Surg. Journ._, July 1845, p. 169.\r\n\r\n§ 325. =Physiological Action.=--It is generally agreed that coniine\r\nparalyses, first the ends of the motor nerves, afterwards their trunks,\r\nand lastly, the motor centre itself. At a later period the sensory\r\nnerves participate. In the earlier stage the respiration is quickened,\r\nthe pupils contracted, and the blood-pressure increased; but on the\r\ndevelopment of paralysis the breathing becomes slowed, the capillaries\r\nrelaxed, and the blood-pressure sinks. Death takes place from cessation\r\nof the respiration, and not primarily from the heart, the heart beating\r\nafter the breathing has stopped. Coniine is eliminated by the urine, and\r\nis also in part separated by the lungs, while a portion is, perhaps,\r\ndecomposed in the body.\r\n\r\n§ 326. =Post-mortem Appearances.=--There is nothing characteristic in\r\nthe appearances after death.\r\n\r\n=Fatal Dose.=--The fatal dose of coniine is not accurately known; it is\r\nabout 150 mgrms. (2·3 grains). In the case of Louise Berger, 10 to 15\r\ndrops appear to have caused death in a few minutes. The auto-experiments\r\nof Dworzak, Heinrich, and Dillaberger would indicate that one drop may\r\ncause unpleasant symptoms. Albers, in the treatment of a woman suffering\r\nfrom cancer of the breast, witnessed convulsions and loss of\r\nconsciousness from a third dose of 4 mgrms. (·06 grain); and Eulenberg,\r\nits full narcotic effects on a child after subcutaneous injection of 1\r\nmgrm. (·015 grain).\r\n\r\n§ 327. =Separation of Coniine from Organic Matters or Tissues.=--The\r\nsubstances are digested with water, acidulated with H₂SO₄, at a\r\ntemperature not exceeding 40°, and then filtered. If the filtrate should\r\nbe excessive, it must be concentrated; alcohol is then added, the liquid\r\nrefiltered, and from the filtrate the alcohol separated by distillation.\r\n\r\nOn cooling, the acid fluid is agitated with benzene, and the latter\r\nseparated in the usual way. The fluid is now alkalised with ammonia, and\r\nshaken up once or twice with its own volume of petroleum ether; the\r\nlatter is separated and washed with distilled water, and the alkaloid is\r\nobtained almost pure. If the petroleum ether leaves no residue, it is\r\ncertain that the alkaloid was not present in the contents of the stomach\r\nor intestine.\r\n\r\nThe affinity of coniine with ether or chloroform is such, that its\r\nsolution in either of these fluids, passed through a _dry_ filter,\r\nscarcely retains a drop of water. In this way it may be conveniently\r\npurified, the impurities dissolved by water remaining behind.\r\n\r\nIn searching for coniine, the stomach, intestines, blood, urine, liver,\r\nand lungs are the parts which should be examined. According to\r\nDragendorff, it has been discovered in the body of a cat six weeks after\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nGreat care must be exercised in identifying any volatile alkaloid as\r\nconiine, for the sources of error seem to be numerous. In one case[348]\r\na volatile coniine-like ptomaine, was separated from a corpse, and\r\nthought to be coniine; but Otto found that in its behaviour to platinic\r\nchloride, it differed from coniine; it was very poisonous--·07 was fatal\r\nto a frog, ·44 to a pigeon, in a few minutes. In the seeds of _Lupinus\r\nluteus_ there is a series of coniine-like substances,[349] but they do\r\nnot give the characteristic crystals with hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\n[348] Otto, _Anleitung z. Ausmittlung d. Gifte_, 1875.\r\n\r\n[349] Sievert, _Zeitschrift für Naturwissenschaften_.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. TOBACCO--NICOTINE.\r\n\r\n§ 328. The different forms of tobacco are furnished by three species of\r\nthe tobacco plant, viz., _Nicotianum tabacum_, _N. rustica_, and _N.\r\npersica_.\r\n\r\nHavanna, French, Dutch, and the American tobaccos are in the main\r\nderived from _N. tabacum_; Turkish, Syrian, and the Latakia tobaccos are\r\nthe produce of _N. rustica_. There seems at present to be little of _N.\r\npersica_ in commerce.\r\n\r\nAll the species of tobacco contain a liquid, volatile, poisonous\r\nalkaloid (_Nicotine_), probably united in the plant with citric and\r\nmalic acids. There is also present in tobacco an unimportant camphor\r\n(_nicotianin_). The general composition of the plant may be gathered\r\nfrom the following table:--\r\n\r\nTABLE SHOWING THE COMPOSITION OF FRESH LEAVES OF TOBACCO (POSSELT AND\r\nRIENMANN).\r\n\r\n  Nicotine,                                          0·060\r\n  Concrete volatile oil,                             0·010\r\n  Bitter extractive,                                 2·870\r\n  Gum with malate of lime,                           1·740\r\n  Chlorophyl,                                        0·267\r\n  Albumen and gluten,                                1·308\r\n  Malic acid,                                        0·510\r\n  Lignine and a trace of starch,                     4·969\r\n  Salts (sulphate, nitrate, and malate of potash, }\r\n  chloride of potassium, phosphate and malate     }  0·734\r\n  of lime, and malate of ammonia,)                }\r\n  Silica,                                            0·088\r\n  Water,                                            88·280\r\n                                                   -------\r\n                                                   100·836\r\n\r\n§ 329. =Quantitative Estimation of Nicotine in Tobacco.=--The best\r\nprocess (although not a perfectly accurate one) is the following:--25\r\ngrms. of the tobacco are mixed with milk of lime, and allowed to stand\r\nuntil there is no odour of ammonia; the mixture is then exhausted by\r\npetroleum ether, the ether shaken up with a slight excess of normal\r\nsulphuric acid, and titrated back by baryta water; the sulphate of\r\nbaryta may be collected and weighed, so as to control the results. With\r\nregard to the percentage of nicotine in commercial tobacco, Kosutany\r\nfound from 1·686 to 3·738 per cent. in dry tobacco; Letheby, in six\r\nsamples, from 1·5 to 3·2 per cent.; whilst Schlössing gives for Havanna\r\n2 per cent., Maryland 2·29 per cent., Kentucky 6·09 per cent., Virginian\r\n6·87 per cent., and for French tobacco, quantities varying from 3·22 to\r\n7·96 per cent. Again, Lenoble found in Paraguay tobacco from 1·8 to 6\r\nper cent.; and Wittstein, in six sorts of tobacco in Germany, 1·54 to\r\n2·72 per cent.\r\n\r\nMr. Cox[350] has recently determined the amount of nicotine in a number\r\nof tobaccos. The results are tabulated in the following table as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n[350] _Pharm. Journ._, Jan. 20, 1894.\r\n\r\nTABLE OF RESULTS, ARRANGED ACCORDING TO PER CENT.

This was made alkaline with soda, and agitated repeatedly with\r\nsuccessive portions of ether. The separated batches of ethereal solution\r\nof nicotine were then mixed and exposed to the air in a cool place. This\r\nexposure to the air carries away ammonia, if any be present, as well as\r\nether.\r\n\r\nWater was added to the ethereal residue, and the amount of nicotine\r\npresent determined by decinormal H₂SO₄, using methyl-orange as an\r\nindicator. One c.c. of decinormal H₂SO₄ represents 0·0162 gramme of\r\nnicotine (C₁₀H₁₄N₂).\r\n\r\n§ 330. =Nicotine= (C₁₀H₁₄N₂).--Hexahydro dipyridyl (C₅H₄N)₂H₆, when\r\npure, is an oily, colourless fluid, of 1·0111, specific gravity at\r\n15°.[351] It evaporates under 100° in white clouds, and boils at about\r\n240°, at which temperature it partly distils over unchanged, and is\r\npartly decomposed--a brown resinous product remaining. It volatilises\r\nwith aqueous and amyl alcohol vapour notably, and is not even fixed at\r\n-10°. It has a strong alkaline reaction, and rotates a ray of polarised\r\nlight to the right. Its odour, especially on warming, is strong and\r\nunpleasantly like tobacco, and it has a sharp caustic taste. It absorbs\r\nwater exposed to the air, and dissolves in water in all proportions,\r\npartly separating from such solution on the addition of a caustic\r\nalkali. The aqueous solution acts in many respects like ammonia,\r\nsaturating acids fully, and may therefore be in certain cases estimated\r\nwith accuracy by titration, 49 parts of H₂SO₄ corresponding to 162 of\r\nnicotine. It gives on oxidation nicotinic acid = m(β) pyridincarbo acid\r\nC₅H₄N(COOH), and by oxidation with elimination of water dipyridyl\r\n(C₅H₄N)₂, and through reduction dipiperydil (C₅H₁₀N)₂.\r\n\r\n[351] J. Skalweit, _Ber. der. deutsch. Chem. Gesell._, 14, 1809.\r\n\r\nAlcohol and ether dissolve nicotine in every proportion; if such\r\nsolutions are distilled, nicotine goes over first. The salts which it\r\nforms with hydrochloric, nitric, and phosphoric acids crystallise with\r\ndifficulty; tartaric and oxalic acid form white crystalline salts, and\r\nthe latter, oxalate of nicotine, is soluble in alcohol, a property which\r\ndistinguishes it from the oxalate of ammonia. The best salts are the\r\noxalate and the acid tartrate of nicotine, from which to regenerate\r\nnicotine in a pure state.\r\n\r\nHydrochloride of nicotine is more easily volatilised than the pure base.\r\nNicotine is precipitated by alkalies, &c., also by many oxyhydrates,\r\nlead, copper, &c. By the action of light, it is soon coloured yellow and\r\nbrown, and becomes thick, in which state it leaves, on evaporation, a\r\nbrown resinous substance, only partly soluble in petroleum ether.\r\n\r\nA very excellent test for nicotine, as confirmatory of others, is the\r\nbeautiful, long, needle-like crystals obtained by adding to an ethereal\r\nsolution of nicotine a solution of iodine in ether. The crystals require\r\na few hours to form.\r\n\r\nChlorine gas colours nicotine blood-red or brown; the product is soluble\r\nin alcohol, and separates on evaporation in crystals.\r\n\r\nCyanogen also colours nicotine brown; the product out of alcohol is not\r\ncrystalline. Platin chloride throws down a reddish crystalline\r\nprecipitate, soluble on warming; and gallic acid gives a flocculent\r\nprecipitate. A drop of nicotine poured on dry chromic acid blazes up,\r\nand gives out an odour of tobacco camphor; if the ignition does not\r\noccur in the cold, it is produced by a gentle heat. It is scarcely\r\npossible to confound nicotine with ammonia, by reason of its odour; and,\r\nmoreover, ammonia may always be excluded by converting the base into the\r\noxalate, and dissolving in absolute alcohol.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a confusion between coniine and nicotine is apt to\r\noccur when small quantities only are dealt with. It may, however, be\r\nguarded against by the following tests:--\r\n\r\n(1.) If coniine be converted into oxalate, the oxalate dissolved in\r\nalcohol, and coniine regenerated by distillation (best in _vacuo_) with\r\ncaustic lye, and then hydrochloric acid added, a crystalline\r\nhydrochlorate of coniine is formed, which doubly refracts light, and is\r\nin needle-shaped or columnar crystals, or dendritic, moss-like forms.\r\nThe columns afterwards become torn, and little rows of cubical,\r\noctahedral, and tetrahedral crystals (often cross or dagger-shaped) grow\r\nout of yellow amorphous masses. Crystalline forms of this kind are rare,\r\nsave in the case of dilute solutions of chloride of ammonium (the\r\npresence of the latter is, of course, rendered by the treatment\r\nimpossible); and nicotine does not give anything similar to this\r\nreaction.\r\n\r\n(2.) Coniine coagulates albumen; nicotine does not.\r\n\r\n(3.) Nicotine yields a characteristic crystalline precipitate with an\r\naqueous solution of mercuric chloride; the similar precipitate of\r\nconiine is amorphous.\r\n\r\n(4.) Nicotine does not react with CS₂ to form thiosulphate (see p. 266).\r\n\r\n§ 331. =Effects on Animals.=--Nicotine is rapidly fatal to all animal\r\nlife--from the lowest to the highest forms. That tobacco-smoke is\r\ninimical to insect-life is known to everybody; very minute quantities in\r\nwater kill infusoria. Fish of 30 grms. weight die in a few minutes from\r\na milligram of nicotine; the symptoms observed are rapid movements, then\r\nshivering and speedy paralysis, with decreased motion of the gills, and\r\ndeath. With frogs, if doses not too large are employed, there is first\r\ngreat restlessness, then strong tetanic convulsions, and a very peculiar\r\nposition of the limbs; the respiration after fatal doses soon ceases,\r\nbut the heart beats even after death. Birds also show tetanic\r\nconvulsions followed by paralysis and speedy death. The symptoms\r\nwitnessed in mammals poisoned by nicotine are not essentially\r\ndissimilar. With large doses the effect is similar to that of prussic\r\nacid--viz., a cry, one or two shuddering convulsions, and death. If the\r\ndose is not too large, there is trembling of the limbs, excretion of\r\nfæces and urine, a peculiar condition of stupor, a staggering gait, and\r\nthen the animal falls on its side. The respiration, at first quickened,\r\nis afterwards slowed, and becomes deeper than natural; the pulse, also,\r\nwith moderate doses, is first slowed, then rises in frequency, and\r\nfinally, again falls. Tetanic convulsions soon develop, during the\r\ntetanus the pupils have been noticed to be contracted, but afterwards\r\ndilated, the tongue and mouth are livid, and the vessels of the ear\r\ndilated. Very characteristic of nicotine poisoning as witnessed in the\r\ncat, the rabbit, and the dog, is its peculiarly violent action, for\r\nafter the administration of from one to two drops, the whole course from\r\nthe commencement of symptoms to the death may take place in five\r\nminutes. F. Vas has drawn the smoke of tobacco from an immense pipe, and\r\ncondensed the products; he finds the well-washed tarry products without\r\nphysiological action, but the soluble liquid affected the health of\r\nrabbits,--they lost weight, the number of the blood corpuscles was\r\ndecreased, and the hæmoglobin of the blood diminished.[352]\r\n\r\n[352] _Archiv. f. Exper. Pathol. u. Pharm._, Bd. 33.\r\n\r\nThe larger animals, such as the horse, are affected similarly to the\r\nsmaller domestic animals. A veterinary surgeon, Mr. John Howard, of\r\nWoolwich,[353] has recorded a case in which a horse suffered from the\r\nmost violent symptoms of nicotine-poisoning, after an application to his\r\nskin of a strong decoction of tobacco. The symptoms were trembling,\r\nparticularly at the posterior part of the shoulders, as well as at the\r\nflanks, and both fore and hind extremities; the superficial muscles were\r\ngenerally relaxed and felt flabby; and the pupils were widely dilated.\r\nThere was also violent dyspnœa, the respirations being quick and short,\r\npulse 32 per minute, and extremely feeble, fluttering, and indistinct.\r\nWhen made to walk, the animal appeared to have partly lost the use of\r\nhis hind limbs, the posterior quarter rolling from side to side in an\r\nunsteady manner, the legs crossing each other, knuckling over, and\r\nappearing to be seriously threatened with paralysis. The anus was very\r\nprominent, the bowels extremely irritable, and tenesmus was present. He\r\npassed much flatus, and at intervals of three or four minutes, small\r\nquantities of fæces in balls, partly in the liquid state, and coated\r\nwith slimy mucus. There was a staring, giddy, intoxicated appearance\r\nabout the head and eyes, the visible mucous membrane being of a dark-red\r\ncolour. A great tendency to collapse was evident, but by treatment with\r\ncold douches and exposure to the open air, the horse recovered.\r\n\r\n[353] _Veter. Journal_, vol. iii.\r\n\r\nIn a case occurring in 1863, in which six horses ate oats which had been\r\nkept in a granary with tobacco, the symptoms were mainly those of\r\nnarcosis, and the animals died.[354]\r\n\r\n[354] _Annales Vétérinaires_, Bruxelles, 1868.\r\n\r\n§ 332. =Effects on Man.=--Poisoning by the pure alkaloid nicotine is so\r\nrare that, up to the present, only three cases are on record. The first\r\nof these is ever memorable in the history of toxicology, being the first\r\ninstance in which a pure alkaloid had been criminally used. The\r\ndetection of the poison exercised the attention of the celebrated\r\nchemist Stas. I allude, of course, to the poisoning of M. Fougnies by\r\nCount Bocarmé and his wife. For the unabridged narrative of this\r\ninteresting case the reader may consult Tardieu’s _Étude Médico-Légale\r\nsur L’Empoisonnement_.\r\n\r\nBocarmé actually studied chemistry in order to prepare the alkaloid\r\nhimself, and, after having succeeded in enticing his victim to the\r\nchateau of Bitremont, administered the poison forcibly. It acted\r\nimmediately, and death took place in five minutes. Bocarmé now attempted\r\nto hide all traces of the nicotine by pouring strong acetic acid into\r\nthe mouth and over the body of the deceased. The wickedness and cruelty\r\nof the crime were only equalled by the clumsy and unskilful manner of\r\nits perpetration. The quantity of nicotine actually used in this case\r\nmust have been enormous, for Stas separated no less than ·4 grm. from\r\nthe stomach of the victim.\r\n\r\nThe second known case of nicotine-poisoning was that of a man who took\r\nit for the purpose of suicide. The case is related by Taylor. It\r\noccurred in June 1863. The gentleman drank an unknown quantity from a\r\nbottle; he stared wildly, fell to the floor, heaving a deep sigh, and\r\ndied quietly without convulsion. The third case happened at\r\nCherbourg,[355] where an officer committed suicide by taking nicotine,\r\nbut how much had been swallowed, and what were the symptoms, are equally\r\nunknown, for no one saw him during life.\r\n\r\n[355] _Ann. d’Hygiène_, 1861, x. p. 404.\r\n\r\nPoisoning by nicotine, pure and simple, then is rare. Tobacco-poisoning\r\nis very common, and has probably been experienced in a mild degree by\r\nevery smoker in first acquiring the habit. Nearly all the fatal cases\r\nare to be ascribed to accident; but criminal cases are not unknown.\r\nChristison relates an instance in which tobacco in the form of snuff was\r\nput into whisky for the purpose of robbery. In 1854, a man was accused\r\nof attempting to poison his wife by putting snuff into her ale, but\r\nacquitted. In another case, the father of a child, ten weeks old, killed\r\nthe infant by putting tobacco into its mouth. He defended himself by\r\nsaying that it was applied to make the child sleep.\r\n\r\nIn October 1855,[356] a drunken sailor swallowed (perhaps for the\r\npurpose of suicide) his quid of tobacco, containing from about half an\r\nounce to an ounce. He had it some time in his mouth, and in half an hour\r\nsuffered from frightful tetanic convulsions. There was also diarrhœa;\r\nthe pupils were dilated widely; the heart’s action became irregular; and\r\ntowards the end the pupils again contracted. He died in a sort of\r\nsyncope, seven hours after swallowing the tobacco.\r\n\r\n[356] _Edin. Med. Journ._, 1855.\r\n\r\n§ 333. In 1829 a curious instance of poisoning occurred in the case of\r\ntwo girls, eighteen years of age, who suffered from severe symptoms of\r\ntobacco-poisoning after drinking some coffee. They recovered; and it was\r\nfound that tobacco had been mixed with the coffee-berries, and both\r\nground up together.[357]\r\n\r\n[357] Barkhausen, _Pr. Ver. Ztg._, v. 17, p. 83, 1838.\r\n\r\nAccidents have occurred from children playing with old pipes. In\r\n1877[358] a child, aged three, used for an hour an old tobacco-pipe, and\r\nblew soap bubbles with it. Symptoms of poisoning soon showed themselves,\r\nand the child died in three days.\r\n\r\n[358] _Pharm. Journ._ [3], 377, 1877.\r\n\r\nTobacco-juice, as expressed or distilled by the heat developed in the\r\nusual method of smoking, is very poisonous. Sonnenschein relates the\r\ncase of a drunken student, who was given a dram to drink, into which his\r\nfellows had poured the juice from their pipes. The result was fatal.\r\nDeath from smoking is not unknown.[359] Helwig saw death follow in the\r\ncase of two brothers, who smoked seventeen and eighteen German pipefuls\r\nof tobacco. Marshall Hall[360] records the case of a young man, nineteen\r\nyears of age, who, after learning to smoke for two days, attempted two\r\nconsecutive pipes. He suffered from very serious symptoms, and did not\r\ncompletely recover for several days. Gordon has also recorded severe\r\npoisoning from the consecutive smoking of nine cigars. The external\r\napplication of the leaf may, as already shown in the case of the horse,\r\nproduce all the effects of the internal administration of nicotine. The\r\nold instance, related by Hildebrand, of the illness of a whole squadron\r\nof hussars who attempted to smuggle tobacco by concealing the leaf next\r\nto their skin, is well known, and is supported by several recent and\r\nsimilar cases. The common practice of the peasantry, in many parts of\r\nEngland, of applying tobacco to stop the bleeding of wounds, and also as\r\na sort of poultice to local swellings, has certainly its dangers. The\r\nsymptoms--whether nicotine has been taken by absorption through the\r\nbroken or unbroken skin, by the bowel, by absorption through smoking, or\r\nby the expressed juice, or the consumption of the leaf itself--show no\r\nvery great difference, save in the question of time. Pure nicotine acts\r\nwith as great a rapidity as prussic acid; while if, so to speak, it is\r\nentangled in tobacco, it takes more time to be separated and absorbed;\r\nbesides which, nicotine, taken in the concentrated condition, is a\r\nstrong enough base to have slight caustic effects, and thus leaves some\r\nlocal evidences of its presence. In order to investigate the effects of\r\npure nicotine, Dworzak and Heinrich made auto-experiments, beginning\r\nwith 1 mgrm. This small dose produced unpleasant sensations in the mouth\r\nand throat, salivation, and a peculiar feeling spreading from the region\r\nof the stomach to the fingers and toes. With 2 mgrms. there was\r\nheadache, giddiness, numbness, disturbances of vision, torpor, dulness\r\nof hearing, and quickened respirations. With 3 to 4 mgrms., in about\r\nforty minutes there was a great feeling of faintness, intense\r\ndepression, weakness, with pallid face and cold extremities, sickness,\r\nand purging. One experimenter had shivering of the extremities and\r\ncramps of the muscles of the back, with difficult breathing. The second\r\nsuffered from muscular weakness, fainting, fits of shivering, and\r\ncreeping sensations about the arms. In two or three hours the severer\r\neffects passed away, but recovery was not complete for two or three\r\ndays. It is therefore evident, from these experiments and from other\r\ncases, that excessive muscular prostration, difficult breathing, tetanic\r\ncramps, diarrhœa, and vomiting, with irregular pulse, represent both\r\ntobacco and nicotine poisoning. The rapidly-fatal result of pure\r\nnicotine has been already mentioned; but with tobacco-poisoning the case\r\nmay terminate lethally in eighteen minutes. This rapid termination is\r\nunusual, with children it is commonly about an hour and a half, although\r\nin the case previously mentioned, death did not take place for two days.\r\n\r\n[359] The question as to whether there is much nicotine in tobacco-smoke\r\ncannot be considered settled; but it is probable that most of the\r\npoisonous symptoms produced are referable to the pyridene bases of the\r\ngeneral formula (C_{n}H_{2n-5}N). Vohl and Eulenberg (_Arch. Pharmac._,\r\n2, cxlvi. p. 130) made some very careful experiments on the smoke of\r\nstrong tobacco, burnt both in pipes and also in cigars. The method\r\nadopted was to draw the smoke first through potash, and then through\r\ndilute sulphuric acid. The potash absorbed prussic acid, hydric\r\nsulphide, formic, acetic, propionic, butyric, valeric, and carbolic\r\nacids; while in the acid the bases were fixed, and these were found to\r\nconsist of the whole series of pyridene bases, from pyridene (C₅H₅N),\r\nboil. point 117°, picoline (C₆H₇N), boil. point 133°, lutidine (C₇H₉N),\r\nboil. point 154°, upwards. When smoked in pipes, the chief yield was\r\npyridene; when in cigars, collidine (C₈H₁₁N); and in general,\r\npipe-smoking was found to produce a greater number of volatile bases.\r\nThe action of these bases has been investigated by several observers.\r\nThey all have a special action on the organism, and all show an increase\r\nin physiological activity as the series is ascended. The lowest produce\r\nmerely excitement from irritation of the encephalic nervous centres, and\r\nthe highest, paralysis of those centres. Death proceeds from gradual\r\nfailure of the respiratory movements, leading to asphyxia--(Kendrick and\r\nDewar, _Proc. Roy. Soc._, xxii. 442; xxiii. 290). The most recent\r\nexperimental work is that of A. Gautier; he found that tobacco smoked in\r\na pipe produced basic compounds, a large quantity of nicotine, and a\r\nhigher homologue of nicotine, C₁₁H₁₆N₂, which pre-exists in tobacco\r\nleaves, and a base C₆H₉NO, which seems to be a hydrate of\r\npicoline--(_Compt. Rend._, t. cxv. p. 992, 993). The derivatives of the\r\npyridene series are also active. The methiodides strongly excite the\r\nbrain and paralyse the extremities. A similar but more energetic action\r\nis exerted by the ethyl and allyl derivatives; the iodyallyl derivatives\r\nare strong poisons. Methylic pyridene carboxylate is almost inactive,\r\nbut the corresponding ammonium salt gives rise to symptoms resembling\r\nepilepsy--(Ramsay, _Phil. Mag._, v. 4, 241). One member of the pyridene\r\nseries β-lutidine has been elaborately investigated by C. Greville\r\nWilliams and W. H. Waters--(_Proc. Roy. Soc._, vol. xxxii. p. 162,\r\n1881). They conclude that it affects the heart profoundly, causing an\r\nincrease in its tonicity, but the action is almost confined to the\r\nventricles. The auricles are but little affected, and continue to beat\r\nafter the ventricles have stopped. The rate of the heart’s beat is\r\nslowed, and the inhibitory power of the vagus arrested. By its action on\r\nthe nervous cells of the spinal cord, it in the first place lengthens\r\nthe time of reflex action, and then arrests that function. Finally, they\r\npoint out that it is antagonistic to strychnine, and may be successfully\r\nemployed to arrest the action of strychnine on the spinal cord.\r\n\r\n[360] _Edin. Med. and Surg. Jour._, xii., 1816.\r\n\r\n§ 334. =Physiological Action.=--Nicotine is absorbed into the blood and\r\nexcreted unchanged, in part by the kidneys and in part by the saliva\r\n(_Dragendorff_). According to the researches of Rosenthal and\r\nKrocker,[361] nicotine acts energetically on the brain, at first\r\nexciting it, and then lessening its activity; the spinal marrow is\r\nsimilarly affected. The convulsions appear to have a cerebral origin;\r\nparalysis of the peripheral nerves follows later than that of the nerve\r\ncentres, whilst muscular irritability is unaffected. The convulsions are\r\nnot influenced by artificial respiration, and are therefore to be\r\nconsidered as due to the direct influence of the alkaloid on the nervous\r\nsystem. Nicotine has a striking influence on the respiration, first\r\nquickening, then slowing, and lastly arresting the respiratory\r\nmovements: section of the vagus is without influence on this action.\r\nThe cause of death is evidently due to the rapid benumbing and paralysis\r\nof the respiratory centre. Death never follows from heart-paralysis,\r\nalthough nicotine powerfully influences the heart’s action, small doses\r\nexciting the terminations of the vagus in the heart, and causing a\r\nslowing of the beats. Large doses paralyse both the controlling and\r\nexciting nerve-centres of the heart; the heart then beats fast,\r\nirregularly, and weakly. The blood-vessels are first narrowed, then\r\ndilated, and, as a consequence, the blood-pressure first rises, then\r\nfalls. Nicotine has a special action on the intestines. As O. Nasse[362]\r\nhas shown, there is a strong contraction of the whole tract, especially\r\nof the small intestine, the lumen of which may be, through a continuous\r\ntetanus, rendered very small. This is ascribed to the peripheral\r\nexcitation of the intestinal nerves and the ganglia. The uterus is also\r\nexcited to strong contraction by nicotine; the secretions of the bile\r\nand saliva are increased.\r\n\r\n[361] _Ueber die Wirkung des Nicotines auf den thierischen Organismus_,\r\nBerlin, 1868.\r\n\r\n[362] _Beiträge zur Physiologie der Darmbewegung, Leipsic_, 1866.\r\n\r\n§ 335. =Fatal Dose.=--The fatal dose for dogs is from ½ to 2 drops; for\r\nrabbits, a quarter of a drop; for an adult not accustomed to tobacco the\r\nlethal dose is probably 6 mgrms.\r\n\r\n§ 336. =Post-mortem Appearances.=--There seem to be no appearances so\r\ndistinctive as to be justly ascribed to nicotine or tobacco-poisoning\r\nand no other.\r\n\r\nA more or less fluid condition of the blood, and, generally, the signs\r\nof death by the lungs, are those most frequently found. In\r\ntobacco-poisoning, when the leaves themselves have been swallowed, there\r\nmay be some inflammatory redness of the stomach and intestine.\r\n\r\n§ 337. =Separation of Nicotine from Organic Matters, &c.=--The process\r\nfor the isolation of nicotine is precisely that used for coniine (see p.\r\n269). It appears that it is unaltered by putrefaction, and may be\r\nseparated and recognised by appropriate means a long time after death.\r\nOrfila detected it in an animal two or three months after death; Melsens\r\ndiscovered the alkaloid unmistakably in the tongues of two dogs, which\r\nhad been buried in a vessel filled with earth for seven years; and it\r\nhas been found, by several experiments, in animals buried for shorter\r\nperiods. Nicotine should always be looked for in the tongue and mucous\r\nmembrane of the mouth, as well as in the usual viscera. The case may be\r\nmuch complicated if the person supposed to be poisoned should have been\r\na smoker; for the defence would naturally be that there had been either\r\nexcessive smoking or chewing, or even swallowing accidentally a quid of\r\ntobacco.[363] A ptomaine has been discovered similar to nicotine.\r\nWolckenhaar separated also an alkaloid not unlike nicotine from the\r\ncorpse of a woman addicted to intemperate habits; but this base was not\r\npoisonous, nor did it give any crystals when an ethereal solution was\r\nadded to an ether solution of iodine. It will be well always to support\r\nthe chemical evidence by tests on animal life, since the intensely\r\npoisonous action of nicotine seems not to be shared by the nicotine-like\r\nptomaines.\r\n\r\n[363] In an experiment of Dragendorff’s, nicotine is said to have been\r\ndetected in 35 grms. of the saliva of a person who had half an hour\r\npreviously smoked a cigar.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. PITURIE.[364]\r\n\r\n[364] See “The Alkaloid from Piturie,” by Prof. Leversidge, _Chem.\r\nNews_, March 18 and 25, 1881.\r\n\r\n    § 338. Piturie (C₆H₈N) is a liquid, nicotine-like alkaloid, obtained\r\n    from the _Duboisia hopwoodii_, a small shrub or tree belonging to\r\n    the natural order _Solanaceæ_, indigenous in Australia. The natives\r\n    mix piturie leaves with ashes from some other plant, and chew them.\r\n    Piturie is obtained by extracting the plant with boiling water\r\n    acidified with sulphuric acid, concentrating the liquid by\r\n    evaporation, and then alkalising and distilling with caustic soda,\r\n    and receiving the distillate in hydrochloric acid. The solution of\r\n    the hydrochlorate is afterwards alkalised and shaken up with ether,\r\n    which readily dissolves out the piturie. The ether solution of\r\n    piturie is evaporated to dryness in a current of hydrogen, and the\r\n    crude piturie purified by distillation in hydrogen, or by changing\r\n    it into its salts, and again recovering, &c. It is clear and\r\n    colourless when pure and fresh, but becomes yellow or brown when\r\n    exposed to air and light. It boils and distils at 243° to 244°. It\r\n    is soluble in all proportions in alcohol, water, and ether; its\r\n    taste is acrid and pungent; it is volatile at ordinary temperatures,\r\n    causing white fumes with hydrochloric acid; it is very irritating to\r\n    the mucous membranes, having a smell like nicotine at first, and\r\n    then, when it becomes browner, like pyridine. It forms salts with\r\n    acids, but the acetate, sulphate, and hydrochlorate are varnish-like\r\n    films having no trace of crystallisation; the oxalate is a\r\n    crystalline salt. Piturie gives precipitates with mercuric chloride,\r\n    cupric sulphate, gold chloride, mercur-potassic iodide, tannin, and\r\n    an alcoholic solution of iodine. If an ethereal solution of iodine\r\n    is added to an ethereal solution of piturie, a precipitate of\r\n    yellowish-red needles, readily soluble in alcohol, is deposited. The\r\n    iodine compound melts at 110°, while the iodine compound of nicotine\r\n    melts at 100°. Piturie is distinguished from coniine by its aqueous\r\n    solution not becoming turbid either on heating or on the addition of\r\n    chlorine water; it differs from picoline in specific gravity,\r\n    picoline being ·9613 specific gravity at 0°, and piturie sinking in\r\n    water; it differs from aniline by not being coloured by chlorinated\r\n    lime. From nicotine it has several distinguishing marks, one of the\r\n    best being that it does not change colour on warming with\r\n    hydrochloric acid and the addition to the mixture afterwards of a\r\n    little nitric acid. The physiological action seems to be but little\r\n    different from that of nicotine. It is, of course, poisonous, but as\r\n    yet has no forensic importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. SPARTEINE.\r\n\r\n    § 339. In 1851 Stenhouse[365] separated a poisonous volatile\r\n    alkaloid from _Spartium scoparium_, the common broom, to which he\r\n    gave the name of sparteine. At the same time a crystalline\r\n    non-poisonous substance, _scoparin_, was discovered.\r\n\r\n[365] _Phil. Trans._, 1851.\r\n\r\n    Sparteine is separated from the plant by extraction with sulphuric\r\n    acid holding water, and then alkalising the acid solution and\r\n    distilling: it has the formula (C₁₅H₂₆N₂), and belongs to the class\r\n    of tertiary diamines. It is a clear, thick, oily substance, scarcely\r\n    soluble in water, to which it imparts a strong, alkaline reaction;\r\n    it is soluble in alcohol, in ether, and chloroform; insoluble in\r\n    benzene and in petroleum; it boils at 288°. Sparteine neutralises\r\n    acids fully, but the oxalate is the only one which can be readily\r\n    obtained in crystals. It forms crystalline salts with platinic\r\n    chloride, with gold chloride, with mercuric chloride, and with zinc\r\n    chloride. The picrate is an especially beautiful salt, crystallising\r\n    in long needles, which, when dried and heated, explode. On sealing\r\n    sparteine up in a tube with ethyl iodide and alcohol, and heating to\r\n    100° for an hour, ethyl sparteine iodide separates in long,\r\n    needle-like crystals, which are somewhat insoluble in cold alcohol.\r\n\r\n    =Effect on Animals.=--A single drop kills a rabbit; the symptoms are\r\n    similar to those produced by nicotine, but the pupils are\r\n    dilated.[366]\r\n\r\n[366] To the nicotine group, gelsemine (C₂₄H₂₈N₂O₄) and oxalathylin\r\n(C₆H₁₀N₂) also belong, in a physiological sense, but gelsemine, like\r\nsparteine, dilates the pupil.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. ANILINE.\r\n\r\n    § 340. =Properties.=--Aniline or amido-benzol (C₆H₅NH₂) is made by\r\n    the reduction of nitro-benzol. It is an oily fluid, colourless when\r\n    quite pure, but gradually assuming a yellow tinge on exposure to the\r\n    air. It has a peculiar and distinctive smell. It boils at 182·5°,\r\n    and can be congealed by a cold of 8°. It is slightly soluble in\r\n    water, 100 parts of water at 16° retaining about 3 of aniline, and\r\n    easily soluble in alcohol, ether, and chloroform. It does not blue\r\n    red-litmus paper, but nevertheless acts as a weak alkali, for it\r\n    precipitates iron from its salts. It forms a large number of\r\n    crystalline salts. The hydrochloride crystallises in white plates,\r\n    and has a melting-point of 192°. The platinum compound has the\r\n    formula of (C₆H₅NH₂HCl)₂PtCl₄, and crystallises in yellow needles.\r\n\r\n    § 341. =Symptoms and Effects.=--Aniline, like picric acid,\r\n    coagulates albumin. Aniline is a blood poison; it produces, even\r\n    during life, in some obscure way, methæmoglobin, and it\r\n    disintegrates the red blood corpuscles; both these effects lessen\r\n    the power of the blood corpuscles to convey oxygen to the tissues,\r\n    hence the cyanosis observed so frequently in aniline poisoning is\r\n    explained. Engelhardt[367] has found that aniline black is produced;\r\n    in every drop of blood there are fine black granules, the total\r\n    effect of which produce a pale blue or grey-blue colour of the skin.\r\n    Aniline has also an action on the central nervous system, at first\r\n    stimulating, and then paralysing. Schmiedeberg finds that\r\n    para-amido-phenol-ether-sulphuric acid is produced, and appears in\r\n    the urine as an alkali salt; a small quantity of fuchsine is also\r\n    produced, and has been found in the urine. Some aniline may be\r\n    excreted unchanged.\r\n\r\n[367] _Beiträge zur Tox. des Anilins. Inaug.-Diss._, Dorpat, 1888.\r\n\r\n    The symptoms are giddiness, weakness, cyanosis, blueness of the\r\n    skin, sinking of the temperature, and dilatation of the pupil. The\r\n    pulse is small and frequent, the skin moist and cold. The patient\r\n    smells of aniline. Towards the end coma and convulsions set in. The\r\n    urine may be brown to brown-black, and may contain hyaline\r\n    cylinders. The blood shows the spectrum of methæmoglobin, and has\r\n    the peculiarities already mentioned. Should the patient recover,\r\n    jaundice often follows. The outward application of aniline produces\r\n    eczema.\r\n\r\n    Chronic poisoning by aniline is occasionally seen among workers in\r\n    the manufacture of aniline. Headache, loss of muscular power,\r\n    diminished sensibility of the skin, vomiting, loss of appetite,\r\n    pallor, eruptions on the skin, and general malaise are the chief\r\n    symptoms. The perspiration has been noticed to have a reddish\r\n    colour.\r\n\r\n    Cases of aniline poisoning are not common; Dr. Fred. J. Smith has\r\n    recorded one in the _Lancet_ of January 13, 1894.[368] The patient,\r\n    a woman, 42 years of age, of alcoholic tendencies, swallowed, 13th\r\n    December 1893, at 1.40 P.M., about 3 ounces of marking ink, the\r\n    greatest part of which consisted of aniline; in a very little while\r\n    she became unconscious, and remained so until death. At 3 P.M. her\r\n    lips were of a dark purple, the general surface of the skin was\r\n    deadly white, with a slight bluish tinge; the pupils were small and\r\n    sluggish, the breathing stertorous, and the pulse full and slow--60\r\n    per minute. The stomach was washed out, ether injected, and oxygen\r\n    administered, but the patient died comatose almost exactly twelve\r\n    hours after the poison had been taken.\r\n\r\n[368] See also a case reported by K. Dehio, in which a person drank 10\r\ngrms. and recovered, _Ber. klinis. Wochen._, 1888, Nr. 1.\r\n\r\n    The _post-mortem_ examination showed slight congestion of the lungs;\r\n    the heart was relaxed in all its chambers, and empty of blood; it\r\n    had a peculiar green-blue appearance. All the organs were healthy.\r\n    The blood was not spectroscopically examined.\r\n\r\n    § 342. =Fatal Dose.=--This is not known, but an adult would probably\r\n    be killed by a single dose of anything over 6 grms. Recovery under\r\n    treatment has been known after 10 grms.; the fatal dose for rabbits\r\n    is 1-1·5 grms., for dogs 3-5 grms.\r\n\r\n    § 343. =Detection of Aniline.=--Aniline is easily separated and\r\n    detected. Organic fluids are alkalised by a solution of potash, and\r\n    distilled. The organs, finely divided, are extracted with water\r\n    acidulated with sulphuric acid, the fluid filtered, and then\r\n    alkalised and distilled. The distillate is shaken up with ether, the\r\n    ether separated and allowed to evaporate spontaneously. Any aniline\r\n    will be in the residue left after evaporation of the ether, and may\r\n    be identified by the following tests:--An aqueous solution of\r\n    aniline or its salts is coloured blue by a little chloride of lime\r\n    or hypochlorite of soda; later on the mixture becomes red. The blue\r\n    colour has an absorption band, when examined spectroscopically,\r\n    extending from W.L. 656 to 560, and therefore in the red and yellow\r\n    from Fraunhofer’s line C, and overlapping D. Another test for\r\n    aniline is the addition of kairine, hydrochloric acid, and sodium\r\n    nitrite, which strikes a blue colour.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--The Opium Group of Alkaloids.\r\n\r\n§ 344. =General Composition.=--Opium contains a larger number of basic\r\nsubstances than any plant known. The list reaches at present to 18 or 19\r\nnitrogenised bases, and almost each year there have been additions. Some\r\nof these alkaloids exist in very small proportion, and have been little\r\nstudied. Morphine and narcotine are those which, alone, are\r\ntoxicologically important. Opium is a gummy mass, consisting of the\r\njuice of the incised unripe fruit of the _Papaver somniferum_ hardened\r\nin the air. The following is a nearly complete list of the constituents\r\nwhich have been found in opium:--\r\n\r\n  Morphine, C₁₇H₁₉NO₃.\r\n  Narcotine, C₂₂H₂₃NO₇.\r\n  Narceine, C₂₃H₂₉NO₉.\r\n  Apomorphine, C₁₇H₁₇NO₂ } By dehydration of morphine and codeine\r\n  Apocodeine, C₁₈H₁₉NO₂  } respectively.\r\n  Pseudomorphine, C₁₇H₁₉NO₄.\r\n  Codamine, C₂₀H₂₅NO₄.\r\n  Ladanine, C₂₀H₂₅NO₄.\r\n  Ladanosine, C₂₁H₂₇NO₄.\r\n  Protapine, C₂₀H₁₉NO₅.\r\n  Cryptopine, C₂₁H₂₃NO₅.\r\n  Lanthopine, C₂₃H₂₅NO₄.\r\n  Hydrocotarnine, C₁₂H₁₅NO₃.\r\n  Opianine, C₂₁H₂₁NO₇.\r\n  Cnoscopine, C₃₄H₃₆N₂O₁₁.\r\n  Rhœadine, C₂₀H₂₁NO₇.\r\n  Codeine, C₁₈H₂₁NO₃.\r\n  Thebaine, C₁₉H₂₁NO₃.\r\n  Papaverine, C₂₀H₂₁NO₄.\r\n  Meconidine, C₂₁H₂₃NO₄.\r\n  Meconin, C₁₀H₁₀O₄.\r\n  Meconic acid, C₇H₄O₇.\r\n  Thebolactic acid.\r\n  Fat.\r\n  Resin.\r\n  Caoutchouc.\r\n  Gummy matters--Vegetable mucus.\r\n  Ash, containing the usual constituents.\r\n\r\nThe various opiums differ, the one from the other, in the percentages of\r\nalkaloids, so that only a very general statement of the mean composition\r\nof opium can be made. The following statement may, however, be accepted\r\nas fairly representative of these differences:--\r\n\r\n                                            Per cent.\r\n  Morphine,                                  6 to 15\r\n  Narcotine,                                 4 to  8\r\n  Other alkaloids,                           5 to  2\r\n  Meconin,                                   Under 1\r\n  Meconic acid,                              3 to  8\r\n  Peculiar resin and caoutchouc,             5 to 10\r\n  Fat,                                       1 to  4\r\n  Gum and soluble humoid acid matters,      40 to 50\r\n  Insoluble matters and mucus,              18 to 20\r\n  Ash,                                       4 to  8\r\n  Water,                                     8 to 30\r\n\r\nThe general results of the analysis of 12 samples of Turkey opium,\r\npurchased by Mr. Bott,[369] from leading druggists in London, Dublin,\r\nand Edinburgh, are as follows:--\r\n\r\n[369] _Year Book of Pharmacy_, 1876.\r\n\r\n=Water.=--Highest, 31·2; lowest, 18·4; mean, 22·4 per cent.\r\n\r\n=Insoluble Residue.=--Highest, 47·9; lowest, 25·45; mean, 32·48 per\r\ncent.\r\n\r\n=Aqueous Extract.=--Highest, 56·15; lowest, 20·90; mean, 45·90 per cent.\r\n\r\n=Crude Morphine= (containing about 7/10 of pure morphine).--Highest,\r\n12·30; lowest, 6·76; mean, 9·92 per cent., which equals 12·3 per cent.\r\nof the dried drug.\r\n\r\n=Persian Opium=, examined in the same way, varied in crude morphine from\r\n2·1 to 8·5 per cent.; Malwa, from 5·88 to 7·30. In 18 samples of\r\ndifferent kinds of opium, the mean percentage of crude morphine was 8·88\r\nper cent. (11 per cent. of the dried opium). According to Guibourt,\r\nSmyrna opium, dried at 100°, yields 11·7 to 21·46 per cent., the mean\r\nbeing 12 to 14 per cent.; Egyptian, from 5·8 to 12 per cent.; Persian,\r\n11·37 per cent. In East Indian Patna opium, for medical use, he found\r\n7·72; in a sample used for smoking, 5·27 per cent.; in Algerian opium,\r\n12·1 per cent.; in French opium, 14·8 to 22·9 per cent.\r\n\r\n§ 345. =Action of Solvents on Opium.=--The action of various solvents on\r\nopium has been more especially studied by several scientists who are\r\nengaged in the extraction of the alkaloids.\r\n\r\n=Water= dissolves nearly everything except resin, caoutchouc, and woody\r\nfibre. Free morphine would be left insoluble; but it seems always to be\r\ncombined with meconic and acetic acids. The solubility of free narcotine\r\nin water is extremely small.\r\n\r\n=Alcohol= dissolves resin and caoutchouc, and all the alkaloids and\r\ntheir combinations, with meconic acid, &c.\r\n\r\n=Amylic Alcohol= dissolves all the alkaloids, if they are in a free\r\nstate, and it also takes up a little of the resin.\r\n\r\n=Ether, Benzene, and Carbon Sulphide= do not dissolve the resin, and\r\nonly slightly morphine, if free; but they dissolve the other free\r\nalkaloids as well as caoutchouc.\r\n\r\n=Acids= dissolve all the alkaloids and the resin.\r\n\r\n=Fixed Alkalies=, in excess, dissolve in part resin; they also dissolve\r\nmorphine freely; narcotine remains insoluble.\r\n\r\n=Lime Water= dissolves morphine, but is a solvent for narcotine only in\r\npresence of morphine.\r\n\r\n=Ammonia= dissolves only traces of morphine; but narceine and codeine\r\nreadily. It does not dissolve the other alkaloids, nor does it dissolve\r\nthe resin.\r\n\r\n§ 346. =Assay of Opium.=--The following processes may be described:--\r\n\r\n=Process of Teschemacher and Smith.=--This process, with a few\r\nmodifications, is as follows:--10 grms. of opium are as completely\r\nexhausted with proof spirit at a boiling temperature as possible. The\r\nresulting alcoholic extract is treated with a few drops of ammonium\r\noxalate solution, and the solution is almost neutralised with ammonia.\r\nThe solution is concentrated to one-third, cooled, and filtered. The\r\nfiltrate is farther concentrated to 5 c.c., and transferred to a small\r\nflask, it is washed into this flask by 4 c.c. of water, and 3 c.c. of 90\r\nper cent. alcohol; next 2 c.c. solution of ammonia (sp. gr. 0·960) and\r\n25 c.c. of dry ether are added. The flask is corked, shaken, and then\r\nallowed to rest over-night.\r\n\r\nThe ether is decanted as completely as possible. Two filter papers are\r\ntaken and counterpoised--that is to say, they are made precisely the\r\nsame weight. The filters are placed one inside the other, and the\r\nprecipitate collected on the inner one; the precipitate is washed with\r\nmorphinated water--that is to say, water in which morphine has been\r\ndigested for some days. The filter papers with their contents are washed\r\nwith benzene and dried, the outer paper put on the pan of the balance\r\ncarrying the weights, and the inner filter with the precipitate weighed.\r\nThe precipitate is now digested with a known volume of decinormal acid,\r\nand then the excess of acid ascertained by titration with decinormal\r\nalkali, using either litmus or methyl orange; each c.c. of decinormal\r\nacid is equal to 30·3 mgrms. of morphine.[370]\r\n\r\n[370] _Pharm. Journal_, xix. 45, 82; xxii. 746. Wright and Farr,\r\n_Chemist and Druggist_, 1893, i. 78.\r\n\r\n=Dott’s Process.=--Dott has recently proposed a new process, which he\r\nstates has given good results. The process is as follows:--10 grammes\r\nof powdered opium are digested with 25 c.c. water; 1·8 gramme barium\r\nchloride dissolved in about 12 c.c. water is then added, the solution\r\nmade up to 50 c.c., well mixed, and after a short time filtered. 22 c.c.\r\n(representing 5 grammes opium) are mixed with dilute sulphuric acid in\r\nquantity just sufficient to precipitate the barium. About 1 c.c. is\r\nrequired, and the solution should be warmed to cause the precipitate to\r\nsubside, and the solution to filter clear. To this filtered solution a\r\nlittle dilute ammonia, about 0·5 c.c. is added to neutralise the free\r\nacid, and the solution concentrated to 6 or 7 c.c., and allowed to cool.\r\n1 c.c. spirit and 1 c.c. ether are then added, and next ammonia in\r\nslight excess. The ammonia should be added gradually until there is no\r\nfurther precipitation, and a perceptible odour of ammonia remains after\r\nwell stirring and breaking down any lumps with the stirring rod. After\r\nthree hours the precipitate is collected on counterpoised filters and\r\nwashed. Before filtering, it should be noted that the solution has a\r\nfaint odour of ammonia: if not, one or two drops of ammonia solution\r\nshould be added. The dried precipitate is washed with benzene or\r\nchloroform, dried, and weighed. It is then titrated with _n_/10 acid,\r\nuntil the morphine is neutralised, as indicated by the solution\r\nreddening litmus paper.[371]\r\n\r\n[371] Other methods of opium assay have been published: see Mr. A. B.\r\nPrescott’s method (_Proceedings of Amer. Pharm. Assoc._, 1878); Allen\r\n(_Commercial Org. Analysis_, vol. ii. p. 473); E. R. Squibb’s\r\nmodification of Flückiger’s method (_Pharm. Journ._ (3), xii. p. 724); a\r\nrapid mode of opium assay, MM. Portes and Lanjlois (_Journ. de Pharm. et\r\nde Chim._, Nov. 1881); _Year Book of Pharmacy_, 1882.\r\n\r\nTo the above may be added--(1.) _Schacht’s Method._--5 to 10 grms. of\r\ndry, finely-powdered opium are digested with sufficient distilled water\r\nto make a thin pulp. After twenty-four hours the whole is thrown on a\r\nweighed filter, and washed until the washings are almost colourless and\r\ntasteless. The portion insoluble in water is dried at 100° and weighed;\r\nin good opium this should not exceed 40 per cent. The filtrate is\r\nevaporated until it is about one-fifth of the weight of the opium taken\r\noriginally; cooled, filtered, and treated with pure animal charcoal,\r\nuntil the dark brown colour is changed into a brownish-yellow. The\r\nliquid is then refiltered, precipitated with a slight excess of ammonia,\r\nallowed to stand in an open vessel until all odour of ammonia\r\ndisappears, and at the same time frequently stirred, in order that the\r\nprecipitate may not become crystalline--a form which is always more\r\ndifficult to purify. The precipitate is now collected on a tared filter,\r\nwashed, dried, and weighed. With an opium containing 10 per cent. of\r\nmorphine, its weight is usually 14 per cent. A portion of the\r\nprecipitate is then detached from the filter, weighed, and exhausted,\r\nfirst with ether, and afterwards with boiling alcohol (0·81 specific\r\ngravity). Being thus purified from narcotine, and containing a little\r\ncolouring-matter only, it may now be dried and weighed, and the amount\r\nof morphine calculated, on the whole, from the data obtained.\r\n\r\n(2.) _Fleury_ has proposed a titration by oxalic acid as follows:--2\r\ngrms. of the powdered opium are macerated a few hours with 8 c.c. of\r\naqueous oxalate of ammonia, brought on a filter, and washed with 5 c.c.\r\nof water. To the filtrate an equal volume of 80 per cent. alcohol and\r\nammonia to alkaline reaction is added; and, after standing twenty-four\r\nhours in a closed flask, it is filtered, and the flask rinsed out with\r\nsome c.c. of 40 per cent. alcohol. The filter, with its contents, after\r\ndrying, is placed in the same flask (which should not be cleansed), a\r\nfew drops of alcoholic logwood solution are added, with an excess of\r\noxalic acid solution of known strength, the whole being made up to 100\r\nc.c. This is divided into two parts, and the excess of acid titrated\r\nback with diluted soda-lye. If the oxalic acid solution is of the\r\nstrength of 4·42 grms. to the litre, every c.c. of the oxalic acid\r\nsolution which has become bound up with morphine, corresponds to 0·02\r\ngrm. of morphine.\r\n\r\n§ 347. =Medicinal and other Preparations of Opium.=--The chief mixtures,\r\npills, and other forms, officinal and non-officinal, in which opium may\r\nbe met with, are as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n(1.) OFFICINAL.\r\n\r\n=Compound Tincture of Camphor=, P. B. (Paregoric).--Opium, camphor,\r\nbenzoic acid, oil of anise, and proof spirit: the opium is in the\r\nproportion of about 0·4 per cent., or 1 grain of opium in 240 minims.\r\n\r\n=Ammoniated Tincture of Opium= (Scotch paregoric).--Strong solution of\r\nammonia, rectified spirit, opium, oil of anise, saffron, and benzoic\r\nacid.

One grain of\r\nopium in 14·8 min.--that is, about 6·7 parts by weight in 100 by\r\nmeasure.\r\n\r\nThe amount of opium actually contained in laudanum has been investigated\r\nby Mr. Woodland,[372] from fourteen samples purchased from London and\r\nprovincial chemists. The highest percentage of extract was 5·01, the\r\nlowest 3·21, the mean being 4·24; the highest percentage of morphine was\r\n·70 per cent., the lowest ·32, the mean being ·51 per cent. It is,\r\ntherefore, clear that laudanum is a liquid of very uncertain strength.\r\n\r\n[372] _Year Book of Pharmacy_, 1882.\r\n\r\n=Aromatic Powder of Chalk and Opium.=--Opium 2·5 per cent., the rest of\r\nthe constituents being cinnamon, nutmeg, saffron, cloves, cardamoms, and\r\nsugar.\r\n\r\n=Compound Powder of Ipecacuanha= (Dover’s Powder).\r\n\r\n  Opium,                   10 per cent.\r\n  Ipecacuanha,             10     „\r\n  Sulphate of Potash,      80     „\r\n\r\n=Confection of Opium= (=Confectio opii=) is composed of syrup and\r\ncompound powder of opium; according to its formula, it contains 2·4 per\r\ncent. of opium by weight.\r\n\r\n=Extract of Opium= contains the solid constituents capable of extraction\r\nby water; it should contain 20 per cent. of morphine, and is therefore\r\nabout double the strength of dry powdered opium.\r\n\r\n=Liquid Extract of Opium= has been also examined by Mr. Woodland:[373]\r\nten samples yielded as a mean 3·95 per cent. of dry extract, the highest\r\nnumber being 4·92 per cent., the lowest 3·02. The mean percentage of\r\nmorphine was ·28 per cent., the highest amount being ·37, and the lowest\r\n·19 per cent.\r\n\r\n[373] _Op. cit._\r\n\r\n=Liniment of Opium= is composed of equal parts of laudanum and soap\r\nliniment; it should contain about 0·0375 per cent. morphine.\r\n\r\n=The Compound Soap-pill= is made of soap and opium, one part of opium in\r\nevery 5·5 of the mass--_i.e._, about 18 per cent.\r\n\r\n=Ipecacuanha and Morphine Lozenges=, as the last, with the addition of\r\nipecacuanha; each lozenge contains 1/36 grain (1·8 mgrms.) morphine\r\nhydrochlorate, 1/12 grain (5·4 mgrms.) ipecacuanha.\r\n\r\n=Morphia Suppositories= are made with hydrochlorate of morphine,\r\nbenzoated lard, white wax, and oil of theobroma; each suppository\r\ncontains ½ grain (32·4 mgrms.) of morphine salt.\r\n\r\n=Opium Lozenges= are composed of opium extract, tincture of tolu, sugar,\r\ngum, extract of liquorice, and water. Each lozenge contains 1/10 grain\r\n(6·4 mgrms.) of extract of opium, or about 1/50 grain (1·3 mgrm.)\r\nmorphine.\r\n\r\n=The Ointment of Galls and Opium= contains one part of opium in 14·75\r\nparts of the ointment--_i.e._, opium 6·7 per cent.\r\n\r\n=Opium Wine=, P. B.--Sherry, opium extract, cinnamon, and cloves. About\r\n5 of opium extract by weight in 100 parts by measure (22 grains to the\r\nounce).\r\n\r\n=Solutions of Morphine=, both of the acetate and hydrochlorate, P. B.,\r\nare made with a little free acid, and with rectified spirit. The\r\nstrength of each is half a grain in each fluid drachm (·0324 grm. in\r\n3·549), or ·91 part by weight in 100 by measure.\r\n\r\n=Solution of Bimeconate of Morphine.=--One fluid oz. contains 5½ grains\r\nof bimeconate of morphine.\r\n\r\n=Morphia Lozenges= are made with the same accessories as opium lozenges,\r\nsubstituting morphine for opium; each lozenge contains 1/36 grain of\r\nhydrochlorate of morphia (1·8 mgrm.).\r\n\r\n=Syrup of Poppies.=--The ordinary syrup of poppies is sweetened\r\nlaudanum. It should, however, be what it is described--viz., a syrup of\r\npoppy-heads. As such, it is said to contain one grain of extract of\r\nopium to the ounce.\r\n\r\n\r\n(2.) PATENT AND OTHER NON-OFFICINAL PREPARATIONS OF OPIUM.\r\n\r\n    =Godfrey’s Cordial= is made on rather a large scale, and is variable\r\n    in strength and composition. It usually contains about 1½ grains of\r\n    opium in each fluid ounce,[374] and, as other constituents:\r\n    sassafras, molasses or treacle, rectified spirit, and various\r\n    flavouring ingredients, especially ginger, cloves, and coriander;\r\n    aniseed and caraways may also be detected.\r\n\r\n[374] If made according to Dr. Paris’ formula, 1⅙ grains in an ounce.\r\n\r\n    =Grinrod’s Remedy for Spasms= consists of hydrochlorate of morphine,\r\n    spirit of sal-volatile, ether, and camphor julep; strength, 1 grain\r\n    of the hydrochlorate in every 6 ounces.\r\n\r\n    =Lemaurier’s Odontalgic Essence= is acetate of morphine dissolved in\r\n    cherry-laurel water; strength, 1 grain to the ounce.\r\n\r\n    =Nepenthe= is a preparation very similar to _Liq. Opii sedativ._,\r\n    and is of about the same strength as laudanum.[375]\r\n\r\n[375] It may be regarded as a purified alcoholic solution of meconate of\r\nmorphia, with a little excess of acid, and of about the same strength as\r\nlaudanum.--_Taylor._\r\n\r\n    =Black Drop= (known also by various names, such as Armstrong’s Black\r\n    Drop) is essentially an acetic acid solution of the constituents of\r\n    opium. It is usually considered to be of four times the strength of\r\n    laudanum. The wholesale receipt for it is: Laudanum, 1 oz., and\r\n    distilled vinegar 1 quart, digested for a fortnight. The original\r\n    formula proposed by the Quaker doctor of Durham, Edward Tunstall,\r\n    is--Opium, sliced, ½ lb.; good verjuice,[376] 3 pints; and nutmeg,\r\n    1½ oz.; boiled down to a syrup thickness; ¼ lb. of sugar and 2\r\n    teaspoonfuls of yeast are then added. The whole is set in a warm\r\n    place for six or eight weeks, after which it is evaporated in the\r\n    open air until it becomes of the consistence of a syrup. It is\r\n    lastly decanted and filtered, a little sugar is added, and the\r\n    liquid made up to 2 pints.\r\n\r\n[376] Verjuice is the juice of the wild crab.\r\n\r\n    =“Nurse’s Drops”= seem to be composed of oil of caraway and\r\n    laudanum.\r\n\r\n    =Powell’s Balsam of Aniseed=, according to evidence in the case of\r\n    _Pharmaceutical Society v. Armson_ (_Pharm. Journ._, 1894), contains\r\n    in every oz. 1/10 grain of morphine.\r\n\r\n    =Dalby’s Carminative=--\r\n\r\n  Carbonate of magnesia,                                40  grains.\r\n  Tincture of castor, and compound tincture  of cardamoms,\r\n  of each                                               15  drops.\r\n  Laudanum,                                              5    „\r\n  Oil of aniseed,                                        3    „\r\n  Oil of nutmeg,                                         2    „\r\n  Oil of peppermint,                                     1    „\r\n  Peppermint water,                                      2  fl. ounces\r\n\r\n    Dose, from a half to one teaspoonful.

The age and sex distribution of the deaths\r\nascribed to accident and those ascribed to suicide are detailed in the\r\nfollowing tabular statement:--\r\n\r\nDEATHS IN ENGLAND AND WALES DURING THE TEN YEARS 1883-1892 FROM OPIUM,\r\nLAUDANUM, MORPHINE, &c.\r\n\r\n                          ACCIDENT.\r\n\r\n  Ages,        0-1  1-5  5-15  15-25  25-65  65 and  Total\r\n                                             above\r\n  Males,        72   27    1     16    302     85     503\r\n  Females,      50   23    4     21    189     86     373\r\n              --------------------------------------------\r\n    Total,     122   50    5     37    491    171     876\r\n              --------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                          SUICIDE.\r\n\r\n  Ages,                  5-15  15-25  25-65  65 and  Total\r\n                                             above\r\n  Males,                   1     26    269     34     330\r\n  Females,               ...     24    126     17     167\r\n                        ----------------------------------\r\n  Total,                   1     50    395     51     497\r\n                        ----------------------------------\r\n\r\nOf European countries, England has the greatest proportional number of\r\nopium poisonings. In France, opium or morphine poisoning accounts for\r\nabout 1 per cent. of the whole; and Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland,\r\nGermany, all give very small proportional numbers; arsenic, phosphorus,\r\nand the acids taking the place of opiates. The more considerable\r\nmortality arises, in great measure, from the pernicious practice--both\r\nof the hard-working English mother and of the baby-farmer--of giving\r\ninfants various forms of opium sold under the name of “_soothing\r\nsyrups_,” “_infants’ friends_,” “_infants’ preservatives_,” “_nurses’\r\ndrops_” and the like, to allay restlessness, and to keep them during the\r\ngreater part of their existence asleep. Another fertile cause of\r\naccidental poisoning is mistakes in dispensing; but these mistakes seem\r\nto happen more frequently on the Continent than in England. This is in\r\nsome degree due to the decimal system, which has its dangers as well as\r\nits advantages, _e.g._:--A physician ordered ·5 decigrm. of morphine\r\nacetate in a mixture for a child, but omitted the decimal point, and the\r\napothecary, therefore, gave ten times the dose desired, with fatal\r\neffect. Again, morphine hydrochlorate, acetate, and similar soluble\r\nsalts are liable to be mistaken for other white powders, and in this way\r\nunfortunate accidents have occurred--accidents that, with proper\r\ndispensing arrangements, should be impossible.\r\n\r\n§ 349. =Poisoning of Children by Opium.=--The drugging of children by\r\nopium--sometimes with a view to destroy life, sometimes merely for the\r\nsake of the continual narcotism of the infant--is especially rife in\r\nIndia.[377] A little solid opium is applied to the roof of the mouth, or\r\nsmeared on the tongue, and some Indian mothers have been known to\r\nplaster the nipples with opium, so that the child imbibes it with the\r\nmilk. Europeans, again and again, have discovered the native nurses\r\nadministering opiates to the infants under their care, and it is feared\r\nthat in many cases detection is avoided.\r\n\r\n[377] See Dr. Chevers’s _Jurisprudence_, 3rd ed., 232 _et seq._\r\n\r\nThe ignorant use of poppy-tea has frequently caused the death of young\r\nchildren; thus in 1875 an inquest was held at Chelsea on the body of a\r\nlittle boy two years and a half old. He had been suffering from\r\nwhooping-cough and enlargement of the bowels, and poppy-tea was by the\r\nadvice of a neighbour given to him. Two poppy-heads were used in making\r\na quart of tea, and the boy, after drinking a great portion of it, fell\r\ninto a deep sleep, and died with all the symptoms of narcotic poisoning.\r\n\r\n§ 350. =Doses of Opium and Morphia.=--Opium in the solid state is\r\nprescribed for adults in quantities not exceeding 3 grains, the usual\r\ndose being from 16·2 mgrms. to 64·8 mgrms. (¼ to 1 grain). The extract\r\nof opium is given in exactly the same proportions (special\r\ncircumstances, such as the habitual use of opium, excepted); the dose of\r\nall the compounds of opium is mainly regulated by the proportion of\r\nopium contained in them.\r\n\r\nThe dose for children (who bear opium ill) is usually very small; single\r\ndrops of laudanum are given to infants at the breast, and the dose\r\ncautiously increased according to age. Most practitioners would consider\r\nhalf a grain a very full dose, and, in cases requiring it, would seldom\r\nprescribe at first more than 1/16 to ¼ grain.\r\n\r\nThe dose of solid opium for a horse is from 1·77 grm. to 7·08 grms. (½\r\ndrachm to 2 drachms); in extreme cases, however, 4 drachms (14·16 grms.)\r\nhave been given.\r\n\r\nThe dose for large cattle is from ·648 grm. to 3·88 grms. (10 to 60\r\ngrains); for calves, ·648 grm. (10 grains); for dogs it is greatly\r\nregulated by the size of the animal, 16·2 to 129·6 mgrms. (¼ grain to 2\r\ngrains).\r\n\r\n=Fatal Dose.=--Cases are recorded of infants dying from extremely small\r\ndoses of opium, _e.g._, ·7, 4·3, and 8·1 mgrms. (1/90, 1/15, and ⅛ of a\r\ngrain); but in such instances one cannot help suspecting some mistake.\r\nIt may, however, be freely conceded that a very small quantity might be\r\nfatal to infants, and that 3 mgrms. given to a child under one year\r\nwould probably develop serious symptoms.\r\n\r\nThe smallest dose of solid opium known to have proved fatal to adults\r\nwas equal to 259 mgrms. (4 grains) of crude opium (_Taylor_), and the\r\nsmallest dose of the tincture (laudanum), 7·0 c.c. (2 drachms),\r\n(_Taylor_); the latter is, however, as already shown, uncertain in its\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\nA dangerous dose (save under special circumstances) is:--For a horse,\r\n14·17 grms. (4 drachms); for cattle, 7·04 grms. (2 drachms); for a dog\r\nof the size and strength of a foxhound, 204 mgrms. (3 grains).\r\n\r\nEnormous and otherwise fatal doses may be taken under certain conditions\r\nby persons who are not opium-eaters. I have seen 13 cgrms. (2 grains) of\r\nmorphine acetate injected hypodermically in a strong man suffering from\r\nrabies with but little effect. Tetanus, strychnine, convulsions, and\r\nexcessive pain all decrease the sensibility of the nervous system to\r\nopium.\r\n\r\n§ 351. =General Method for the Detection of Opium.=--It is usually laid\r\ndown in forensic works that, where poisoning by opium is suspected, it\r\nis sufficient to detect the presence of meconic acid in order to\r\nestablish that of opium. In a case of adult poisoning there is generally\r\nsubstance enough available to obtain one or more alkaloids, and the\r\npresence of opium may, without a reasonable doubt, be proved, if meconic\r\nacid (as well as either morphine, narcotine, thebaine, or other opium\r\nalkaloid) has been detected. Pills containing either solid opium or the\r\ntincture usually betray the presence of the drug by the odour, and in\r\nsuch a case there can be no possible difficulty in isolating morphine\r\nand meconic acid, with probably one or two other alkaloids. The method\r\nof extraction from organic fluids is the same as before described, but\r\nit may, of course, be modified for any special purpose. If opium, or a\r\npreparation of opium, be submitted to Dragendorff’s process (see p.\r\n242), the following is a sketch of the chief points to be noticed.\r\n\r\nIf the solution is _acid_--\r\n\r\n(1.) =Benzene= mainly extracts _meconin_, which dissolves in sulphuric\r\nacid very gradually (in twenty-four to forty-eight hours), with a green\r\ncolour passing into red. Meconin has no alkaloidal reaction.\r\n\r\n(2.) =Amyl alcohol= dissolves small quantities of _meconic acid_,\r\nidentified by striking a blood-red colour with ferric chloride.\r\n\r\nIf now the amyl alcohol is removed with the aid of petroleum ether, and\r\nthe fluid made alkaline by ammonia--\r\n\r\n(1.) =Benzene= extracts _narcotine_, _codeine_, and _thebaine_. On\r\nevaporation of the benzene the alkaloidal residue may be dissolved in\r\nwater, acidified with sulphuric acid, and after filtration, on adding\r\nammonia _in excess_, _thebaine and narcotine_ are precipitated,\r\n_codeine_ remaining in solution. The dried precipitate, if it contain\r\nthebaine, becomes blood-red when treated with cold concentrated\r\nsulphuric acid, while narcotine is shown by a violet colour developing\r\ngradually when the substance is dissolved in dilute sulphuric acid 1 :\r\n5, and gently warmed. The codeine in the ammoniacal solution can be\r\nrecovered by shaking up with benzene, and recognised by the red colour\r\nwhich the solid substance gives when treated with a little sugar and\r\nsulphuric acid.\r\n\r\n(2.) =Chloroform= especially dissolves the _narceine_, which, on\r\nevaporation of the chloroform, may be identified by its general\r\ncharacters, and by its solution in Fröhde’s reagent becoming a beautiful\r\nblue colour. Small quantities of morphine may be extracted with codeine.\r\n\r\n(3.) =Amyl alcohol= extracts from the alkaline solution morphine,\r\nidentified by its physical characters, by its forming a crystalline\r\nprecipitate with iodine and hydriodic acid, and the reaction with iodic\r\nacid to be described.\r\n\r\n§ 352. =Morphine= (C₁₇H₁₇NO(OH)₂ + H₂O).--Morphine occurs in commerce as\r\na white powder, sp. gr. 1·205, usually in the form of more or less\r\nperfect six-sided prisms, but sometimes in that of white silky needles.\r\nWhen heated in the subliming cell (described at pp. 257-8), faint\r\nnebulæ, resolved by high microscopic powers into minute dots, appear on\r\nthe upper disc at 150°. As the temperature is raised the spots become\r\ncoarser, and at 188° distinct crystals may be obtained, the best being\r\nformed at nearly 200°, at which temperature morphine begins distinctly\r\nto brown, melt, and carbonise. At temperatures below 188°, instead of\r\nminute dots, the sublimate may consist of white circular spots or\r\nfoliated patterns. One part of morphine, according to P. Chastaing, is\r\nsoluble at a temperature of 3° in 33,333 parts of water; at 22°, in 4545\r\nparts; at 42°, 4280; and at 100°, 4562. It is scarcely soluble in ether\r\nor benzene. Absolute alcohol, according to Pettenkofer, dissolves in the\r\ncold one-fortieth of its weight; boiling, one-thirtieth. Amyl alcohol,\r\nin the cold, dissolves one-fourth per cent., and still more if the\r\nalkaloid be thrown out of an aqueous acid solution by ammonia in the\r\npresence of amyl alcohol; for under such circumstances the morphine has\r\nno time to become crystalline. According to Schlimpert, 1 part of\r\nmorphine requires 60 of chloroform for solution; according to\r\nPettenkofer, 175.\r\n\r\nMorphine is easily soluble in dilute acids, as well as in solutions of\r\nthe caustic alkalies and alkaline earths; carbonated alkalies and\r\nchloride of ammonium also dissolve small quantities. The acid watery,\r\nand the alcoholic solutions, turn the plane of polarisation to the left;\r\nfor sulphuric, nitric, and hydrochloric acids [α]_r_ = 89·8°; in\r\nalkaline solution the polarisation is less, [α]_r_ = 45·22°. It is\r\nalkaline in reaction, neutralising acids fully; and, in fact, a\r\nconvenient method of titrating morphine is by the use of a centinormal\r\nsulphuric acid--each c.c. equals 2·85 mgrms. of anhydrous morphine.\r\n\r\n§ 353. The salts of morphine are for the most part crystalline, and are\r\nall bitter, neutral, and poisonous. They are insoluble in amylic\r\nalcohol, ether, chloroform, benzene, or petroleum ether.\r\n\r\n=Morphine meconate= is one of the most soluble of the morphine salts; it\r\nis freely soluble in water. Of all salts this is most suitable for\r\nsubcutaneous injection; it is the form in which the alkaloid exists in\r\nopium.\r\n\r\n=Morphine hydrochlorate= (C₁₇H₁₉NO₃HCl) crystallises in silky fibres; it\r\nis readily soluble in alcohol, and is soluble in cold, more freely in\r\nboiling water. The purest morphine hydrochlorate is colourless, but that\r\nwhich is most frequently met with in commerce is fawn or buff-coloured.\r\n\r\n=Morphine acetate= is a crystallisable salt, soluble in water or\r\nalcohol; it is in part decomposed by boiling the aqueous solution, some\r\nof the acetic acid escaping.\r\n\r\n=Morphine Tartrates.=--These are readily soluble salts, and it is\r\nimportant to note that the morphine might escape detection, if the\r\nexpert trusted alone to the usual test of an alkaloidal salt giving a\r\nprecipitate when the solution is alkalised by the fixed or volatile\r\nalkalies; for the tartrates of morphine do not give this reaction, nor\r\ndo they give any precipitate with calcic chloride. By adding a solution\r\nof potassium acetate in spirit, and also alcohol and a little acetic\r\nacid to the concentrated solution, the tartrate is decomposed, and acid\r\ntartrate of potassium is precipitated in the insoluble form; the\r\nmorphine in the form of acetate remains in solution, and then gives the\r\nusual reactions.\r\n\r\nThe solubility of morphine salts in water and alcohol has been\r\ninvestigated by Mr. J. U. Lloyd. His results are as follows:--\r\n\r\n  =Morphine Acetate.=\r\n\r\n   11·70 parts of water by weight at 15·0° dissolve 1 part of morphine\r\n         acetate.\r\n   61·5  parts of water by weight at 100° dissolve 1 part of morphine\r\n         acetate.\r\n   68·30 parts of alcohol by weight (·820 specific gravity) at 15·0°\r\n         dissolve 1 part of morphine acetate.\r\n   13·30 parts of alcohol by weight (·820 specific gravity) at 100°\r\n         dissolve 1 part of morphine acetate.\r\n\r\n  =Morphine Hydrochlorate.=\r\n\r\n   23·40 parts of water dissolve at 15° 1 morphine hydrochlorate.\r\n     ·51 part of water dissolves at 100° 1 morphine hydrochlorate.\r\n   62·70 parts of alcohol (·820 specific gravity) dissolve at 15° 1\r\n         morphine hydrochlorate.\r\n   30·80 parts of alcohol (·820 specific gravity) dissolve at 100° 1\r\n         morphine hydrochlorate.\r\n\r\n  =Morphine Sulphate.=\r\n\r\n   21·60 parts of water at 15° dissolve 1 morphine sulphate.\r\n     ·75 part of water at 100° dissolves 1 morphine sulphate.\r\n  701·5  parts of alcohol (·820) at 15° dissolve 1 morphine sulphate.\r\n  144·00 parts of alcohol (·820) at 100° dissolve 1 morphine sulphate.\r\n\r\n§ 354. =Constitution of Morphine.=--The chief facts bearing on the\r\nconstitution of morphine are as follows:--\r\n\r\nIt certainly contains two hydroxyl groups, because by the action of\r\nacetic anhydride, acetyl morphine and diacetyl morphine,\r\nC₁₇H₁₈(CH₃CO)NO₃ and C₁₇H₁₇(CH₃CO)₂NO₃ are produced. The formation of\r\nthe monomethyl ether of morphine (codeine), C₁₇H₁₇(OH)(OCH₃)NO, is also\r\na testimony to the existence of hydroxyl groups. One of the hydroxyl\r\ngroups has phenolic functions, the other alcoholic functions. By\r\nsuitable oxidation morphine yields trinitrophenol (picric acid), and by\r\nfusion with an alkali, protocatechuic acid; both of these reactions\r\nsuggest a benzene ring. On distilling with zinc dust phenanthrene,\r\npyridine, pyrrol, trimethylamine, and ammonia are formed; evidence of a\r\npyridine nucleus. If morphine is mixed with 10 to 15 times its weight of\r\na 20 per cent. solution of potash, and heated at 180° for from four to\r\nsix hours, air being excluded, a phenol-like compound is formed, and a\r\nvolatile amine, ethylmethylamine (the amine boils at 34° to 35°, and its\r\nhydrochloride melts at 133°). This reaction is interpreted by Z. H.\r\nSkrauk[378] and L. Wiegmann to indicate that the nitrogen is directly\r\nconnected with two alkyl groups--that is, ethyl and methyl.\r\n\r\n[378] _Monatsb._, x. 110-114.\r\n\r\nG. N. Vis,[379] after a careful review of the whole of the reactions of\r\nmorphine, has proposed the following constitutional formula as the one\r\nthat agrees best with the facts:--\r\n\r\n  CH--CH--CH--CH--CH----------------C--CH--CH\r\n  |       |   |   |                 |  |\r\n  CH--CH--CH--O   NMe--CH₂--CH(OH)--C--CH--CH\r\n\r\n[379] _J. pr. Chemie_ (2), xlvii. 584. Knorr’s formula is--\r\n\r\n          CHOH--CHO--CH₂\r\n         /      |       \\\r\n  OH.C₁₀H₅       |        >\r\n         \\      |       /\r\n          CH₂---CH.NMeCH₂\r\n\r\n_Ber._, xxii. 1113-1119.\r\n\r\n§ 355. =Tests for Morphine.=--(1.) One hundredth of a milligrm. of pure\r\nmorphine gives a blue colour to a paste of ammonium molybdate in\r\nsulphuric acid; 20 mgrms. of ammonium molybdate are rubbed with a glass\r\nrod in a porcelain dish, and well mixed with 5 drops of pure strong\r\nsulphuric acid and the morphine in a solid form applied; titanic acid\r\nand tungstates give similar reactions.\r\n\r\n(2.) Morphine possesses strong reducing properties; a little solid\r\nmorphine dissolved in a solution of ferric chloride gives a Prussian\r\nblue precipitate when ferridcyanide solution is added. A number of\r\nptomaines and other substances also respond to this test, so that in\r\nitself it is not conclusive.\r\n\r\n(3.) =Iodic Acid Test.=--The substance supposed to be morphine is\r\nconverted into a soluble salt by adding to acid reaction a few drops of\r\nhydrochloric acid, and then evaporating to dryness. The salt thus\r\nobtained is dissolved in as little water as possible--this, as in\r\ntoxicological researches only small quantities are recovered, will\r\nprobably be but a few drops. A little of the solution is now mixed with\r\na very small quantity of starch paste, and evaporated to dryness at a\r\ngentle heat in a porcelain dish. After cooling, a drop of a solution of\r\n1 part of iodic acid in 15 of water is added to the dry residue; and if\r\neven the 1/20000 of a grain of morphine be present, a blue colour will\r\nbe developed.\r\n\r\nAnother way of working the iodic acid test is to add the iodic acid\r\nsolution to the liquid in which morphine is supposed to be dissolved,\r\nand then shake the liquid up with a few drops of carbon disulphide. If\r\nmorphine be present, the carbon disulphide floats to the top distinctly\r\ncoloured pink. Other substances, however, also set free iodine from\r\niodic acid, and it has, therefore, been proposed to distinguish morphine\r\nfrom these by the after addition of ammonia. If ammonia is added to the\r\nsolution, which has been shaken up with carbon disulphide, the pink or\r\nred colour of the carbon disulphide is deepened, if morphine was\r\npresent; on the contrary, if morphine was _not_ present, it is either\r\ndischarged or much weakened.\r\n\r\n=Other Reactions.=--There are some very interesting reactions besides\r\nthe two characteristic tests just mentioned. If a saturated solution of\r\nchloride of zinc be added to a little solid morphine, and heated over\r\nthe water-bath for from fifteen minutes to half-an-hour, the liquid\r\ndevelops a beautiful and persistent green colour. This would be an\r\nexcellent test for morphine were it not for the fact that the colour is\r\nproduced with only pure morphine. For example, I was unable to get the\r\nreaction from morphine in very well-formed crystals precipitated from\r\nordinary laudanum by ammonia, the least trace of resinous or\r\ncolouring-matter seriously interfering. By the action of nitric acid on\r\nmorphine, the liquid becomes orange-red, and an acid product of the\r\nformula C₁₀H₉NO₉ is produced, which, when heated in a closed tube with\r\nwater at 100°, yields trinitrophenol or picric acid. This interesting\r\nreaction points very decidedly to the phenolic character of morphine. On\r\nadding a drop of sulphuric acid to solid morphine in the cold, the\r\nmorphine solution becomes of a faint pink; on gently warming and\r\ncontinuing the heat until the acid begins to volatilise, the colour\r\nchanges through a series of brownish and indefinite hues up to black. On\r\ncooling and treating the black spot with water, a green solution is\r\nobtained, agreeing in hue with the same green produced by chloride of\r\nzinc. Vidali[380] has proposed the following test:--Morphine is\r\ndissolved in strong sulphuric acid, and a little arsenate of sodium is\r\nadded; on gently warming, a passing blue colour develops; on raising the\r\ntemperature higher, the liquid changes into green, then into blue, and\r\nfinally again into green. Codeine acts very similarly. The following\r\ntest originated with Siebold (_American Journal of Pharmacy_, 1873, p.\r\n544):--The supposed morphine is heated gently with a few drops of\r\nconcentrated sulphuric acid and a little pure potassic perchlorate. If\r\nmorphine be present the liquid immediately takes a pronounced brown\r\ncolour--a reaction said to be peculiar to morphine, and to succeed with\r\n1/10 of a mgrm. In order to obtain absolutely pure perchlorate, potassic\r\nperchlorate is heated with hydrochloric acid so long as it disengages\r\nchlorine; it is then washed with distilled water, dried, and preserved\r\nfor use. There is also a test known as “Pellagri’s”; it depends on the\r\nproduction of apomorphine. The suspected alkaloid is dissolved in a\r\nlittle strong hydrochloric acid, and then a drop of concentrated\r\nsulphuric acid is added, and the mixture heated for a little time from\r\n100° to 120°, until it assumes a purple-black colour. It is now cooled,\r\nsome hydrochloric acid again added, and the mixture neutralised with\r\nsodic carbonate. If morphine be present, on the addition of iodine in\r\nhydriodic acid, a cherry-red colour is produced, passing into green.\r\nMorphine and codeine are believed alone to give this reaction.\r\n\r\n[380] D. Vidali, _Bull. Farmaceut._, Milano, 1881, p. 197; D. E. Dott,\r\n_Year Book of Pharmacy_, 1882.\r\n\r\nThe acetate of morphine, and morphine itself, when added to ferric\r\nchloride solution, develop a blue colour. When 1 molecule of morphine is\r\ndissolved in alcohol, containing 1 molecule of sodium hydroxide, and 2\r\nvols. of methyl iodide are added, and the mixture gently heated, a\r\nviolent reaction sets in and the main product is codeine methiodide\r\n(C₁₇H₁₈NO₂OCH,MeI). If only half the quantity of methyl iodide is added,\r\nthen free codeine is in small quantity produced; if ethyl iodide be\r\nsubstituted for methyl, a new base is formed homologous with\r\ncodeine--codeine is therefore the methyl ether of morphine. If morphine\r\nis heated with iodide of methyl and absolute alcohol in a closed tube\r\nfor half an hour at 100°, methyl iodide of morphine is obtained in\r\ncolourless, glittering, quadratic crystals, easily soluble in water\r\n(C₁₇H₁₉NO₃MeI + H₂O); similarly the ethyl iodide compound can be\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nIf morphine is heated for from two to three hours in a closed tube with\r\ndilute hydrochloric acid, water is eliminated--\r\n\r\n  (C₁₇H₁₉NO₃ = C₁₇H₁₇NO₂ + H₂O),\r\n\r\nand the hydrochlorate of apomorphine is produced. This succeeds when\r\neven ½ mgrm. is heated with 1/10 c.c. of strong HCl, and the tests for\r\napomorphine applied.\r\n\r\nIf concentrated sulphuric acid be digested on morphine for twelve to\r\nfifteen hours (or heated for half an hour at 100°), on adding to the\r\ncooled violet-coloured solution either a crystal of nitrate of potash or\r\nof chlorate of potash, or a drop of dilute nitric acid, a beautiful\r\nviolet-blue colour is produced, which passes gradually into a dark\r\nblood-red. 1/100 of a mgrm. will respond distinctly to this test.\r\nFröhde’s reagent strikes with morphine a beautiful violet colour,\r\npassing from blue into dirty green, and finally almost vanishing. 1/200\r\nof a mgrm. will respond to the test, but it is not itself conclusive,\r\nsince papaverine and certain glucosides give an identical reaction.\r\n\r\n§ 356. =Symptoms of Opium and Morphine Poisoning.=--The symptoms of\r\nopium and morphine poisoning are so much alike, that clinically it is\r\nimpossible to distinguish them; therefore they may be considered\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n=Action on Animals--Frogs.=--The action of morphine or opium on frogs is\r\npeculiar: the animal at first springs restlessly about, and then falls\r\ninto a condition extremely analogous to that seen in strychnine\r\npoisoning, every motion or external irritation producing a tetanic\r\nconvulsion. This condition is, however, sometimes not observed. The\r\ntetanic stage is followed by paralysis of reflex movements and cessation\r\nof breathing, the heart continuing to beat.\r\n\r\n=Dogs.=--0·2 to 0·5 grm. of morphine meconate, or acetate, injected\r\ndirectly into the circulation of a dog, shows its effects almost\r\nimmediately. The dog becomes uneasy, and moves its jaws and tongue as if\r\nsome peculiar taste were experienced; it may bark or utter a whine, and\r\nthen in a minute or two falls into a profound sleep, which is often so\r\ndeep that while it lasts--usually several hours--an operation may be\r\nperformed. In whatever attitude the limbs are placed, they remain. The\r\nrespiration is rapid and stertorous, and most reflex actions are\r\nextinguished. Towards the end of the sleep, any sudden noise may startle\r\nthe animal, and when he wakes his faculties are evidently confused. A\r\npartial paralysis of the hind legs has often been noticed, and then the\r\ndog, with his tail and pelvis low, has something the attitude of the\r\nhyena. Hence this condition (first, I believe, noticed by Bernard) has\r\nbeen called the “hyenoid” state. If the dose is larger than 2 to 3 grms.\r\n(31 to 46 grains), the symptoms are not dissimilar, save that they\r\nterminate in death, which is generally preceded by convulsions.[381]\r\n\r\n[381] MM. Grasset and Amblard have studied the action of morphine in\r\ncausing convulsions in the mammalia. They found that if small doses of\r\nhydrochlorate of morphine (from 1 to 15 centigrammes) are administered\r\nto dogs, the brief sleep which is produced may be accompanied by partial\r\nmuscular contractions (in one paw, for instance), which are renewed at\r\nvariable intervals. Then occur true convulsive shocks in the whole body\r\nor in the hind limbs. After an interval, the phenomena recur in more\r\nintense degree, and are followed by true convulsions. Regularly, ten or\r\nsixteen times a minute, at each inspiration, the hind limbs present a\r\nseries of convulsive movements, which may become general. Sometimes they\r\nare excited by external stimulation, but they are usually spontaneous.\r\nThe sleep may continue profound during this convulsive period, or it may\r\nbecome distinctly lighter. These convulsive phenomena may continue, with\r\nintervals, for an hour. Differences are observed with different animals;\r\nbut the chief characters of the phenomena are as described. In certain\r\nanimals, and with small doses, there may be a brief convulsive phase at\r\nthe commencement of the sleep, but it is much less constant than the\r\nlater period of spasm. These convulsions, the authors believe, have not\r\npreviously been described, except as a consequence of very large doses,\r\namounting to grammes. The period of cerebral excitement, described by\r\nClaude Bernard as occurring at the commencement of the sleep from\r\nmorphine, is a phenomenon of a different order. The conclusions drawn\r\nfrom the experiments are--(1) That morphia is not diametrically opposed\r\nto thebaine, as is often stated, since it has, to a certain degree, the\r\nconvulsive properties of the latter alkaloid. (2) That the excitomotor\r\naction of opium cannot be exclusively attributed to the convulsive\r\nalkaloids, but is, in fact, due to those which are soporific. According\r\nto the ordinary composition of opium, 5 centigrammes of morphine\r\nrepresent about a milligramme of thebaine. But these experiments show\r\nthat the quantity of morphine has a much more powerful convulsive action\r\nthan a milligramme of thebaine. (3) There is not the supposed antagonism\r\nbetween the action of morphine on the frog and on the mammalia. (4) The\r\nresearches hitherto undertaken on the antagonism between morphine and\r\nother agents need to be repeated, and a separate study made of the\r\nsubstances which antagonise the convulsive and soporific action.\r\n\r\n=Goats.=--According to Guinard, goats are proof against the narcotic\r\ninfluence of morphine. Large doses kill goats, but death is caused by\r\ninterference with the respiratory function. A young goat weighing 30\r\nkilos, showed little effect beyond a slightly increased cerebral\r\nexcitability after two doses of 8 and 8·5 grms. respectively of morphine\r\nhydrochlorate had been administered by intravenous injection, the second\r\nbeing given an hour and a half after the first. To the same animal two\r\ndays afterwards 195 grms. were administered in the same way, yet the\r\ngoat recovered. The lethal dose for a goat seems to be no less than 1000\r\ntimes that which will produce narcotism in man, and lies somewhere\r\nbetween 0·25 to 0·30 per kilo. of the body weight.[382]\r\n\r\n[382] _Compt. Rend._, t. cxvi. pp. 520-522.\r\n\r\n=Cats and the Felidæ.=--According to Guinard,[383] morphine injected\r\nsubcutaneously or intravenously into cats, in doses varying from 0·4\r\nmgrm. to 90 mgrms. per kilo., never produces sleep or narcotic\r\nprostration. On the contrary, it causes a remarkable degree of\r\nexcitement, increasing in intensity with the dose given. This excitement\r\nis evidently accompanied by disorder in the functions of the brain, and\r\nif the dose is large convulsions set in, ending in death. According to\r\nMilne-Edwards, the same symptoms are produced in lions and tigers.\r\n\r\n[383] _Compt. Rend._, t. cxi. pp. 981-983. The _bovine_ animals also get\r\nexcited, and no narcotic effect is produced by dosing them with\r\nmorphine.--_Compt. Rend. Soc. de Biologie_, t. iv., v.\r\n\r\n=Birds=, especially pigeons, are able to eat almost incredible\r\nquantities of opium. A pigeon is said[384] to have consumed 801 grains\r\nof opium, mixed with its food, in fourteen days. The explanation of this\r\nis that the poison is not absorbed; for subcutaneous injections of salts\r\nof morphine act rapidly on all birds hitherto experimented upon.\r\n\r\n[384] Hermann’s _Lehrbuch der exper. Toxicologie_, p. 374.\r\n\r\n§ 357. =Physiological Action.=--From experiments on animals, the\r\nessential action of morphine on the nervous and arterial systems has in\r\nsome measure been examined. There is no very considerable action on the\r\nheart. The beats are first accelerated, then diminished in frequency;\r\nbut very large doses introduced directly into the circulation at once\r\ndiminish the pulsations, and no acceleration is noticed. The slowing may\r\ngo on to heart-paralysis. The slowing is central in its origin, for on\r\nthe vagi being cut, morphine always quickens. With regard to the\r\nperipheric ends of the vagi, small doses excite, large paralyse. If all\r\nthe nerves going to the heart are divided, there is first a considerable\r\nacceleration, and then a slowing and weakening of the pulsations. The\r\narterial blood-pressure, at first increased, is afterwards diminished.\r\nThis increase of blood-pressure is noticed during the acceleration of\r\nthe pulse, and also during some portion of the time during which the\r\npulse is slowed. Stockman and D. B. Dott,[385] experimenting on rabbits\r\nand frogs, consider that a medium dose of morphine first of all\r\ndepresses the spinal cord and then excites it, for tetanus follows. If\r\nmorphine is in sufficient quantity thrown into the circulation then\r\ntetanus at once occurs. It would thus appear that depression and\r\nstimulation is entirely a matter of dosage. Gescheidlen, in his\r\nresearches on the frog, found the motor nerves at first excited, and\r\nthen depressed. When the doses were large, there was scarcely any\r\nexcitement, but the reverse effect, in the neighbourhood of the place of\r\napplication. According to other observers, the function of the motor\r\nnerves may be annihilated.[386] According to Meihuizen, reflex action,\r\nat first much diminished, is later, after several hours, normal, and\r\nlater still again increased. The intestinal movements are transitorily\r\nincreased. In the dog there has been noticed a greater flow of saliva\r\nthan usual, and the flow of bile from the gall-bladder is diminished.\r\nThe pupils in animals are mostly contracted, but, if convulsions occur\r\ntowards death, they are dilated.\r\n\r\n[385] _Brit. Med. Journ._ (2), 1890, 189-192.\r\n\r\n[386] _Arch. f. d. Ges. Physiol._, vii. p. 201.\r\n\r\n§ 358. =Physiological Effect of Morphine Derivatives.=--By introducing\r\nmethyl, or amyl, or ethyl, into the morphine molecule, the narcotic\r\naction is diminished, while the tetanic effects are increased. Acetyl,\r\ndiacetyl, benzoyl, and dibenzoyl morphine, morphine sulphuric ether, and\r\nnitrosomorphine are all weaker narcotics than morphine, but, on the\r\nother hand, they depress the functions of the spinal cord and bring on,\r\nin large doses, tetanus.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of two methyl groups into morphine, as in\r\nmetho-codeine, C₁₇H₁₇MeNO(OH)-Me, entirely alters the physiological\r\neffect. This compound has an action on voluntary muscle causing gradual\r\nparalysis.\r\n\r\nThe chlorine derivatives, trichlormorphine and chlorcodeine, have the\r\ncharacteristic action of the morphine group on the central nervous\r\nsystem and, in addition, act energetically as muscle poisons, soon\r\ndestroying the contractile power of the voluntary muscles with which\r\nthey first come into contact at the place of injection, and more\r\ngradually affecting the other muscles of the body.[387]\r\n\r\n[387] R. Stockman and Dott, _Brit. Med. Journ._ (2), 1890, 189-192.\r\n\r\n§ 359. =Action on Man.=--There are at least three forms of opium\r\npoisoning:--(1) _The common form_, as seen in about 99 per cent. of\r\ncases; (2) A very _sudden form_, in which death takes place with fearful\r\nrapidity (the _foudroyante_ variety of the French);[388] and (3) a very\r\nrare entirely _abnormal form_, in which there is no coma, but\r\nconvulsions.\r\n\r\n[388] Tardieu, _Étude Méd. Légale sur l’Empoisonnement._\r\n\r\nIn the _common form_ there are three stages, viz.:--(1) Excitement; (2)\r\nNarcosis; (3) Coma. In from half an hour to an hour[389] the first\r\nsymptoms commence, the pulse is quickened, the pupils are contracted,\r\nthe face flushes, and the hands and feet reddened,--in other words, the\r\ncapillary circulation is active. This stage has some analogy to the\r\naction of alcohol; the ideas mostly flow with great rapidity, and\r\ninstead of a feeling of sleepiness, the reverse is the case. It,\r\nhowever, insensibly, and more or less rapidly, passes into the next\r\nstage of heaviness and stupor. There is an irresistible tendency to\r\nsleep; the pulse and the respiration become slower; the conjunctivæ are\r\nreddened; the face and head often flushed. In some cases there is great\r\nirritability of the skin, and an eruption of nettle-rash. If the poison\r\nhas been taken by the mouth, vomiting may be present. The bowels are\r\nusually--in fact almost invariably--constipated. There is also some loss\r\nof power over the bladder.\r\n\r\n[389] In a remarkable case related by Taylor, a lady took a large dose\r\n(supposed to be 1½ oz.) of laudanum, and there were no symptoms for four\r\nand a half hours. She died in twenty-two hours.\r\n\r\nIn the next stage, the narcosis deepens into dangerous coma; the patient\r\ncan no longer be roused by noises, shaking, or external stimuli; the\r\nbreathing is loud and stertorous; the face often pale; the body covered\r\nwith a clammy sweat. The pupils are still contracted, but they may in\r\nthe last hours of life dilate: and it is generally agreed that, if a\r\ncorpse is found with the pupils dilated, this circumstance, taken in\r\nitself, does not contra-indicate opium or morphine poisoning. Death\r\noccasionally terminates by convulsion.\r\n\r\nThe _sudden form_ is that in which the individual sinks into a deep\r\nsleep almost immediately--that is, within five or ten minutes--and dies\r\nin a few hours. In these rapid cases the pupils are said to be\r\nconstantly dilated.\r\n\r\nExamples of the _convulsive form_ are to be sought among opium-eaters,\r\nor persons under otherwise abnormal conditions.\r\n\r\nA man, forty years old, who had taken opiates daily since his\r\ntwenty-second year--his dose being 6 grms. (92·4 grains) of solid\r\nopium--when out hunting, of which sport he was passionately fond, took\r\ncold, and, as a remedy, administered to himself three times his\r\naccustomed dose. Very shortly there was contraction of the left arm,\r\ndisturbance of vision, pain in the stomach, faintness, inability to\r\nspeak, and unconsciousness which lasted half an hour. Intermittent\r\nconvulsions now set in, and pains in the limbs. There was neither\r\nsomnolence nor delirium, but great agitation; repeated vomiting and\r\ndiarrhœa followed. After five hours these symptoms ceased; but he was\r\nexcessively prostrate.[390] There was complete recovery.\r\n\r\n[390] Demontporcellet, _De l’Usage Quotidien de l’Opium_, Paris, 1874.\r\n\r\nOne may hazard a surmise that, in such a case, tolerance has been\r\nestablished for morphine, but not for other morphine alkaloids in the\r\nsame degree, and that the marked nervous symptoms were in no small\r\ndegree the effect of some of the homologous alkaloids, which, in such an\r\nenormous dose, would be taken in sufficient quantity to have a\r\nphysiological action.\r\n\r\nThere are several instances of a relapsing or remittent form of\r\npoisoning--a form in which the patient more or less completely recovers\r\nconsciousness, and then sinks back into a fatal slumber. One of the best\r\nknown is the case of the Hon. Mrs Anson (January 1859), who swallowed an\r\nounce and a half of laudanum by mistake. After remaining in a comatose\r\ncondition for more than nine hours, she revived. The face became\r\nnatural, the pulse steady. She was able to recognise her daughter, and\r\nin a thick voice to give an account of the mistake. But this lasted only\r\nten minutes, when she again became comatose, and died in fourteen\r\nhours.[391]\r\n\r\n[391] Taylor, _op. cit._\r\n\r\nIn a Swedish case quoted by Maschka,[392] a girl, nine years old, in\r\nweak health and suffering from slight bronchitis, had been given a\r\nnon-officinal acetate of morphia lozenge, which was supposed to contain\r\n5 mgrms. (·075 grain) of morphine acetate. She took the lozenge at eight\r\nin the evening; soon slept, woke at ten, got out of bed, laughed,\r\ntalked, and joked with the nurse, again got into bed, and very quickly\r\nfell asleep. At four A.M. the nurse came and found her breathing with a\r\nrattling sound, and the physician, who arrived an hour later, found the\r\ngirl in a state of coma, with contracted pupils, breathing stertorously,\r\nand the pulse scarcely to be felt. Despite all attempts to rouse the\r\npatient, she died at eight in the morning, twelve hours after taking the\r\nlozenge.\r\n\r\n[392] Maschka’s _Handbuch_, Band ii. p. 438; also Svenska, _Läk-Sällsk.\r\nFörhandl._, Apr. 1, p. 90; Apr. 8, p. 160, 1873. For other cases see\r\nNasmyth, _Edin. Med. Journ._, Dec. 1878; Kirby, _Dub. Med. Press_, Dec.\r\n24, 1845; W. Boyd Muschet, _Med. Times and Gaz._, March 20, 1858.\r\n\r\nThe _post-mortem_ examination showed some hyperæmia of the brain and\r\nserous effusion in the ventricles, and there was also tubercle in the\r\npleura. Three lozenges similar to the one taken by the patient were\r\nchemically investigated by Hamberg, who found that the amount of acetate\r\nwas very small, and that the lozenges, instead of morphine acetate,\r\nmight be considered as prepared with almost pure morphine; the content\r\nin the three of morphine being respectively 35, 37, and 42 mgrms. (that\r\nis, from half a grain to three-fifths of a grain). There was a\r\ndifference of opinion among the experts as to whether in this case the\r\nchild died from morphine poisoning or not--a difference solely to be\r\nattributed to the waking up of the child two hours after taking the\r\npoison. Now, considering the great probability that a large dose for a\r\nweakly child of that age had been taken, and that this is not the only\r\ncase in which a relapse has occurred, it seems just to infer that it was\r\nreally a case of poisoning.\r\n\r\nAs unusual symptoms (or rather sequelæ) may be noted in a few cases,\r\nhemiplegia, which soon passes off; a weakness of the lower extremities\r\nmay also be left, and inability to empty the bladder thoroughly; but\r\nusually on recovery from a large dose of opium, there is simply\r\nheaviness of the head, a dry tongue, constipation, and loss of appetite.\r\nAll these symptoms in healthy people vanish in a day or two. There have\r\nalso been noticed slight albuminuria, eruptions on the skin, loss of\r\ntaste, and numbness of parts of the body.\r\n\r\nOpium, whether taken in substance, or still more by subcutaneous\r\ninjection, in some individuals constantly causes faintness. In my own\r\ncase, I have several times taken a single grain of opium to relieve\r\neither pain or a catarrh; almost invariably within an hour afterwards\r\nthere has been great coldness of the hands and feet, lividity of the\r\nface, a feeling of deadly faintness followed by vomiting; this stage\r\n(which has seldom lasted more than half an hour) passed, the usual\r\nnarcotic effects have been produced.\r\n\r\nSome years ago I injected one-sixth of a grain of morphine hydrochlorate\r\nsubcutaneously into an old gentleman, who was suffering from acute\r\nlumbago, but was otherwise healthy, and had no heart disease which could\r\nbe detected; the malady was instantly relieved, and he called out, “I am\r\nwell; it is most extraordinary.” He went out of the front door, and\r\nwalked some fifty yards, and then was observed to reel about like a\r\ndrunken man. He was supported back and laid in the horizontal posture;\r\nthe face was livid, the pulse could scarcely be felt, and there was\r\ncomplete loss of consciousness. This state lasted about an hour, and\r\nwithout a doubt the man nearly died. Medical men in practice, who have\r\nbeen in the habit of using hypodermic injections of morphine, have had\r\nexperiences very similar to this and other cases, and although I know of\r\nno actual death, yet it is evident that morphine, when injected\r\nhypodermically even in a moderate dose, may kill by syncope, and within\r\na few minutes.[393] Absorption by hypodermic administration is so rapid\r\nthat by the time, or even before the needle of the syringe is withdrawn,\r\na contraction of the pupil may be observed.\r\n\r\n[393] See a case of morphia poisoning by hypodermic injection, and\r\nrecovery, by Philip E. Hill, M.R.C.S., _Lancet_, Sept. 30, 1882. In this\r\ninstance a third of a grain introduced subcutaneously caused most\r\ndangerous symptoms in a gardener, aged 48.\r\n\r\nOpium or morphine is poisonous by whatever channel it gains access to\r\nthe system, the intestinal mucous membrane absorbs it readily, and\r\nnarcotic effects may be produced by external applications, whether a\r\nwound is present or not. A case of absorption of opium by a wound is\r\nrelated in Chevers’s _Jurisprudence_.[394] A Burman boy, about nine or\r\nten years of age, was struck on the forehead by a brick-bat, causing a\r\ngaping wound about an inch long; his parents stuffed the wound with\r\nopium. On the third day after the accident, and the opium still\r\nremaining in the wound, he became semi-comatose, and, in short, had all\r\nthe symptoms of opium narcosis; with treatment he recovered. The\r\nunbroken skin also readily absorbs the drug. Tardieu states that he had\r\nseen 30 grms. of laudanum, applied on a poultice to the abdomen, produce\r\ndeath. Christison has also cited a case in which a soldier suffered from\r\nerysipelas, and died in a narcotic state, apparently produced from the\r\ntoo free application of laudanum to the inflamed part.\r\n\r\n[394] Third ed., p. 228.\r\n\r\nTo these cases may be added the one cited by Taylor, in which a druggist\r\napplied 30 grains of morphine to the surface of an ulcerated breast, and\r\nthe woman died with all the symptoms of narcotic poisoning ten hours\r\nafter the application--an event scarcely surprising. It is a curious\r\nquestion whether sufficient of the poison enters into the\r\nsecretions--_e.g._, the milk--to render it poisonous. An inquest was\r\nheld in Manchester, Nov. 1875, on the body of a male child two days old,\r\nin which it seemed probable that death had occurred through the mother’s\r\nmilk. She was a confirmed opium-eater, taking a solid ounce per week.\r\n\r\n§ 360. =Diagnosis of Opium Poisoning.=--The diagnosis is at times\r\nbetween poisoning by opium or other narcotic substances, at others,\r\nbetween opium and disease. Insensibility from chloral, from alcohol,\r\nfrom belladonna or atropine, and from carbon oxide gas, are all more or\r\nless like opium poisoning. With regard to chloral, it may be that only\r\nchemical analysis and surrounding circumstances can clear up the matter.\r\nIn alcohol poisoning, the breath commonly smells very strongly of\r\nalcohol, and there is no difficulty in separating it from the contents\r\nof the stomach, &c., besides which the stomach is usually red and\r\ninflamed. Atropine and belladonna invariably dilate the pupil, and\r\nalthough just before death opium has the same effect, yet we must hold\r\nthat mostly opium contracts, and that a widely-dilated pupil during life\r\nwould, _per se_, lead us to suspect that opium had not been used,\r\nalthough, as before mentioned, too much stress must not be laid upon the\r\nstate of the pupils. In carbon oxide, the peculiar rose-red condition of\r\nthe body affords a striking contrast to the pallor which, for the most\r\npart, accompanies opium poisoning. In the rare cases in which\r\nconvulsions are a prominent symptom, it may be doubtful whether opium or\r\nstrychnine has been taken, but the convulsions hitherto noticed in opium\r\npoisoning seem to me to have been rather of an epileptiform character,\r\nand very different from the effects of strychnine. No rules can be laid\r\ndown for cases which do not run a normal course; in medicine such are\r\nbeing constantly met with, and require all the care and acumen of the\r\ntrained observer. Cases of disease render a diagnosis often extremely\r\ndifficult, and the more so in those instances in which a dose of\r\nlaudanum or other opiate has been administered. In a case under my own\r\nobservation, a woman, suffering from emphysema and bronchitis, sent to a\r\nchemist for a sleeping draught, which she took directly it arrived. A\r\nshort time afterwards she fell into a profound slumber, and died within\r\nsix hours. The draught had been contained in an ounce-and-a-half bottle;\r\nthe bottle was empty, and the druggist stated in evidence that it only\r\ncontained 20 minims of laudanum, 10 grains of potassic bromide, and\r\nwater. On, however, diluting the single drop remaining in the bottle,\r\nand imitating its colour with several samples of laudanum diluted in the\r\nsame way, I came to the conclusion that the quantity of laudanum which\r\nthe bottle originally contained was far in excess of that which had been\r\nstated, and that it was over 1 drachm and under 2 drachms. The body was\r\npallid, the pupils strongly contracted, the vessels of the brain\r\nmembranes were filled with fluid blood, and there was about an ounce of\r\nserous fluid in each ventricle. The lungs were excessively\r\nemphysematous, and there was much secretion in the bronchi; the liver\r\nwas slightly cirrhotic. The blood, the liver, and the contents of the\r\nstomach were exhaustively analysed with the greatest care, but no trace\r\nof morphine, narcotine, or meconic acid could be separated, although the\r\nwoman did not live more than six hours after taking the draught. I gave\r\nthe opinion that it was, in the woman’s state, improper to prescribe a\r\nsedative of that kind, and that probably death had been accelerated, if\r\nnot directly caused, by opium.\r\n\r\nDeaths by apoplexy will only simulate opium-poisoning during life; a\r\n_post-mortem_ examination will at once reveal the true nature of the\r\nmalady. In epilepsy, however, it is different, and more than once an\r\nepileptic fit has occurred and been followed by coma--a coma which\r\ncertainly cannot be distinguished from that produced by a narcotic\r\npoison. Death in this stage may follow, and on examining the body no\r\nlesion may be found.\r\n\r\n§ 361. =Opium-eating.=--The consumption of opium is a very ancient\r\npractice among Eastern nations, and the picture, drawn by novelist and\r\ntraveller, of poor, dried-up, yellow mortals addicted to this vice, with\r\ntheir faculties torpid, their skin hanging in wrinkles on their wasted\r\nbodies, the conjunctivæ tinged with bile, the bowels so inactive that\r\nthere is scarcely an excretion in the course of a week, the mental\r\nfaculties verging on idiocy and imbecility, is only true of a percentage\r\nof those who are addicted to the habit. In the _British Medical Journal_\r\nfor 1894, Jan. 13 and 20, will be found a careful digest of the\r\nevidence collated from 100 Indian medical officers, from which it\r\nappears that opium is taken habitually by a very large number of the\r\npopulation throughout India, those who are accustomed to the drug taking\r\nit in quantities of from 10 to 20 grains in the twenty-four hours; so\r\nlong as this amount is not exceeded they do not appear to suffer\r\nill-health or any injurious effect. The native wrestlers even use it\r\nwhilst training. The habitual consumption of opium by individuals has a\r\ndirect medico-legal bearing. Thus in India, among the Rajpoots, from\r\ntime immemorial, infused opium has been the drink both of reconciliation\r\nand of ordinary greeting, and it is no evidence of death by poison if\r\neven a considerable quantity of opium be found in the stomach after\r\ndeath, for this circumstance taken alone would, unless the history of\r\nthe case was further known, be considered insufficient proof. So, again,\r\nin all climates, and among all races, it is entirely unknown what\r\nquantity of an opiate should be considered a poisonous dose for an\r\nopium-eater. Almost incredible quantities have, indeed, been consumed by\r\nsuch persons, and the commonly-received explanation, that the drug, in\r\nthese cases, passes out unabsorbed, can scarcely be correct, for Hermann\r\nmentions the case of a lady of Zurich who daily injected subcutaneously\r\n1 to 2 grms. (15-31 grains) of a morphine salt. In a case of uterine\r\ncancer, recorded by Dr. W. C. Cass,[395] 20 grains of morphine in the\r\ntwelve hours were frequently used subcutaneously; during thirteen months\r\nthe hypodermic syringe was used 1350 times, the dose each time being 5\r\ngrains. It is not credible that an alkaloid introduced into the body\r\nhypodermically should not be absorbed.\r\n\r\n[395] _Lancet_, March 25, 1882. See also Dr. Boulton’s case, _Lancet_,\r\nMarch 18, 1882.\r\n\r\nOpium-smoking is another form in which the drug is used, but it is an\r\nopen question as to what poisonous alkaloids are in opium smoke. It is\r\nscarcely probable that morphine should be a constituent, for its\r\nsubliming point is high, and it will rather be deposited in the cooler\r\nportion of the pipe. Opium, specially prepared for smoking, is called\r\n“Chandoo”; it is dried at a temperature not exceeding 240°. H.\r\nMoissan[396] has investigated the products of smoking chandoo, but only\r\nfound a small quantity of morphine. N. Gréhant and E. Martin[397] have\r\nalso experimented with opium smoke; they found it to have no appreciable\r\neffect on a dog; one of the writers smoked twenty pipes in succession,\r\ncontaining altogether 4 grms. of chandoo. After the fourth pipe there\r\nwas some headache, at the tenth pipe and onwards giddiness. Half an hour\r\nafter the last pipe the giddiness and headache rapidly went off. In any\r\ncase, opium-smoking seems to injure the health of Asiatics but little.\r\nMr. Vice-Consul King, of Kew-Kiang, in a tour through Upper Yangtse and\r\nStechnan, was thrown much into the company of junk sailors and others,\r\n“almost every adult of whom smoked more or less.” He says:--“Their work\r\nwas of the hardest and rudest, rising at four and working with hardly\r\nany intermission till dark, having constantly to strip and plunge into\r\nthe stream in all seasons, and this often in the most dangerous parts.\r\nThe quantity of food they eat was simply prodigious, and from this and\r\ntheir work it seems fairly to be inferred that their constitution was\r\nrobust. The two most addicted to the habit were the pilot and the ship’s\r\ncook. On the incessant watchfulness and steady nerve of the former the\r\nsafety of the junk and all on board depended, while the second worked so\r\nhard from 3 A.M. to 10 P.M., and often longer, and seemed so independent\r\nof sleep or rest, that to catch him seated or idle was sufficient cause\r\nfor good-humoured banter. This latter had a conserve of opium and sugar\r\nwhich he chewed during the day, as he was only able to smoke at night.”\r\n\r\n[396] _Compt. Rend._, cxv. 988-992.\r\n\r\n[397] _Compt. Rend._, 1012-1014.\r\n\r\n§ 362. =Treatment of Opium or Morphine Poisoning.=--The first thing to\r\nbe done is doubtless to empty the stomach by means of the flexible\r\nstomach tube; the end of a sufficiently long piece of indiarubber tubing\r\nis passed down into the pharynx and allowed to be carried into the\r\nstomach by means of the natural involuntary movements of the muscles of\r\nthe pharynx and gullet; suction is then applied to the free end and the\r\ncontents syphoned out; the stomach is, by means of a funnel attached to\r\nthe tube, washed out with warm water, and then some coffee administered\r\nin the same way.\r\n\r\nShould morphine have been taken, and permanganate of potash be at hand,\r\nit has been shown that under such circumstances potassic permanganate is\r\na perfect antidote, decomposing at once any morphine remaining in the\r\nstomach, but it, of course, will have no effect upon any morphine which\r\nhas already been absorbed. In a case of opium poisoning, reported in the\r\n_Lancet_ of June 2, 1894, by W. J. C. Merry, M.B., inhalations of\r\noxygen, preceded by emptying the stomach and other means, appeared to\r\nsave a man, who, three hours before the treatment, had drank 2 ozs. of\r\nchlorodyne. It is also the received treatment to ward off the fatal\r\nsleep by stimulation; the patient is walked about, flicked with a towel,\r\nmade to smell strong ammonia, and so forth. This stimulation must,\r\nhowever, be an addition, but must never replace the measures first\r\ndetailed.\r\n\r\n§ 363. =Post-mortem Appearances.=--There are no characteristic\r\nappearances after death save hyperæmia of the brain and blood-vessels of\r\nthe membranes, with generally serous effusion into the ventricles. The\r\npupils are sometimes contracted, sometimes dilated, the dilatation\r\noccurring, as before mentioned, in the act of dying. The external\r\nsurface of the body is either livid or pale. The lungs are commonly\r\nhyperæmic, the bladder full of urine; still, in not a few cases, there\r\nis nothing abnormal, and in no single case could a pathologist, from the\r\nappearance of the organs only, declare the cause of death with\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\n§ 364. =Separation of Morphine from Animal Tissues and\r\nFluids.=--Formerly a large proportion of the opium and morphine cases\r\nsubmitted to chemical experts led to no results; but owing to the\r\nimproved processes now adopted, failure, though still common, is less\r\nfrequent. The constituents of opium taken into the blood undergo partial\r\ndestruction in the animal body, but a portion may be found in the\r\nsecretions, more especially in the urine and fæces. First\r\nBouchardat[398] and then Lefort[399] ascertained the excretion of\r\nmorphine by the urine after medicinal doses; Dragendorff and Kauzmann\r\nshowed that the appearance of morphine in the urine was constant, and\r\nthat it could be easily ascertained and separated from the urine of men\r\nand animals; and Levinstein[400] has also shown that the elimination\r\nfrom a single dose may extend over five or six days. The method used by\r\nDragendorff to extract morphine from either urine or blood is to shake\r\nthe liquid (acidified with a mineral acid) several times with amyl\r\nalcohol, which, on removal, separates urea and any bile acids. The\r\nliquid thus purified is then alkalised, and shaken up with amyl alcohol,\r\nand this amyl alcohol should contain any morphine that was present. On\r\nevaporation it may be pure enough to admit of identification, but if\r\nnot, it may be redissolved and purified on the usual principles.\r\nConsiderable variety of results seems to be obtained by different\r\nexperimenters. Landsberg[401] injected hypodermically doses of ·2 to ·4\r\ngrm. of morphine hydrochlorate into dogs, making four experiments in\r\nall, but failed to detect morphine in the urine. A large dose with 2·4\r\nmgrms. of the salt gave the same result. On the other hand, ·8 grm. of\r\nmorphine hydrochlorate injected direct into the jugular vein, was partly\r\nexcreted by the kidneys, for 90 c.c. of the urine yielded a small\r\nquantity of morphine. Voit, again, examined the urine and fæces of a man\r\nwho had taken morphine for years; he could detect none in the urine, but\r\nseparated morphine from the fæces.[402] Morphine may occasionally be\r\nrecognised in the blood. Dragendorff[403] found it in the blood of a cat\r\ntwenty-five minutes after a subcutaneous dose, and he also separated it\r\nfrom the blood of a man who died of morphine poisoning in six hours.\r\nHaidlen[404] recognised morphine in the blood of a suicide who had taken\r\nopium extract.\r\n\r\n[398] _Bull. Gén. de Thérap._, Dec. 1861.\r\n\r\n[399] _Journ. de Chim._, xi. 93, 1861.\r\n\r\n[400] _Berl. klin. Wochenschr._, 1876, 27.\r\n\r\n[401] _Pflüger’s Archiv._, 23, 433, 413-433. _Chem. Soc.

Correspondenzbl._, xxxiv. 16, 1863.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in a case recorded at p. 304, where a woman died in\r\nsix hours from a moderate dose, probably of laudanum, although the\r\nquantity of blood operated upon was over a pound in weight, and every\r\ncare was taken, the results were entirely negative. In poisoning by\r\nlaudanum there may be some remaining in the stomach, and also if large\r\ndoses of morphine have been taken by the mouth; but when morphine has\r\nbeen administered hypodermically, and in all cases in which several\r\nhours have elapsed, one may almost say that the organ in which there is\r\nthe least probability of finding the poison is the stomach. It may, in\r\nsome cases, be necessary to operate on a very large scale;--to examine\r\nthe fæces, mince up the whole liver, the kidney, spleen, and lungs, and\r\ntreat them with acid alcohol. The urine will also have to be examined,\r\nand as much blood as can be obtained. In cases where all the evidence\r\npoints to a minute quantity (under a grain) of morphine, it is decidedly\r\nbest to add these various extracts together, to distil off the alcohol\r\nat a very gentle heat, to dry the residue in a vacuum, to dissolve again\r\nin absolute alcohol, filter, evaporate again to dryness, dissolve in\r\nwater, and then use the following process:--\r\n\r\n§ 365. =Extraction of Morphine.=--To specially search for morphine in\r\nsuch a fluid as the urine, it is, according to the author’s experience,\r\nbest to proceed strictly as follows:--The urine is precipitated with\r\nacetate of lead, the powdered lead salt being added to the warm urine\r\ncontained in a beaker on the water-bath, until a further addition no\r\nlonger produces a precipitate; the urine is then filtered, the lead\r\nprecipitate washed, and the excess of lead thrown down by SH₂; the lead\r\nhaving been filtered off, and the precipitate washed, the urine is\r\nconcentrated down to a syrup in a vacuum. The syrup is now placed in a\r\nseparating tube (if not acid, it is acidified with hydrochloric acid),\r\nand shaken up successively with petroleum ether, chloroform, ether, and,\r\nlastly, with amylic alcohol (the latter should be warm); finally, the\r\nsmall amount of amylic alcohol left dissolved in the liquid is got rid\r\nof by shaking it up with petroleum ether. To get rid of the last traces\r\nof petroleum ether, it may be necessary to turn the liquid into an\r\nevaporating dish, and gently heat for a little time over the water-bath.\r\nThe acid liquid is now again transferred to the separating tube, and\r\nshaken up with ether, after being made alkaline with ammonia; this will\r\nremove nearly all alkaloids save morphine,--under the circumstances, a\r\nvery small quantity of morphine may indeed be taken up by the ether, but\r\nnot the main bulk. After separating the ether, the liquid is again made\r\nslightly acid, so as to be able to precipitate morphine in the presence\r\nof the solvent; the tube is warmed on the water-bath, at least its own\r\nbulk of hot amylic alcohol added and the liquid made alkaline, and the\r\nwhole well shaken. The amylic alcohol is removed in the usual way, and\r\nshaken with a small quantity of decinormal sulphuric acid; this washes\r\nout the alkaloid from the amyl alcohol, and the same amyl alcohol can be\r\nused again and again. It is best to extract the liquid for morphine at\r\nleast thrice, and to operate with both the solution and the amyl hot.\r\nThe decinormal acid liquid is made slightly alkaline with ammonia, and\r\nallowed to stand for at least twelve hours; any precipitate is collected\r\nand washed with ether, and then with water; the alkaline liquid from\r\nwhich the morphine has been separated is concentrated to the bulk of 5\r\nc.c. on the water bath, and again allowed to stand for twelve hours; a\r\nlittle more morphine may often in this way be obtained.\r\n\r\nThe author in some test experiments, in which weighed small quantities\r\nof morphine (60-80 mgrms.) were dissolved in a little decinormal\r\nsulphuric acid, and added to large quantities of urine, found the\r\nprocess given to yield from 80 to 85 per cent. of the alkaloid added,\r\nand it was always recovered in fine crystals of a slight brown tint,\r\nwhich responded well to tests.\r\n\r\nVarious other methods were tried, but the best was the one given; the\r\nmethod not only separates the alkaloid with but little loss, but also in\r\na sufficiently pure state to admit of identification.\r\n\r\nFrom the tissues the alkaloid may be dissolved out by the general method\r\ngiven at p. 239, and the ultimate aqueous solution, reduced to a bulk of\r\nnot more than 25 c.c., treated by the ethereal solvents in the way just\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n§ 366. =Narcotine= (C₂₂H₂₃NO₇) crystallises out of alcohol or ether in\r\ncolourless, transparent, glittering needles, or groups of needles,\r\nbelonging to the orthorhombic system.\r\n\r\nIt is only slightly soluble in boiling, and almost insoluble in cold\r\nwater. One part requires 100 parts of cold, and 20 of boiling 84 per\r\ncent. alcohol; 126 parts of cold, 48 of boiling ether (specific gravity\r\n0·735); 2·69 parts of chloroform; 400 of olive oil; 60 of acetic ether;\r\n300 of amyl alcohol; and 22 parts of benzene, for solution. The neutral\r\nsolution of narcotine turns the plane of polarisation to the left [α]_r_\r\n= 130·6; the acid solution to the right. Narcotine has no effect on red\r\nlitmus paper.\r\n\r\nNarcotine gives no crystalline sublimate; its behaviour in the subliming\r\ncell is described at p. 259. Its melting-point, taken in a tube, is\r\nabout 176°.\r\n\r\n=Behaviour of Narcotine with Reagents.=--Narcotine, dissolved in dilute\r\nhydrochloric acid, and then treated with a little bromine, gives a\r\nyellow precipitate, which on boiling is dissolved; by gradually adding\r\nsolution of bromine and boiling, a fine rose colour is produced,\r\nreadily destroyed by excess of bromine. This is perhaps the best test\r\nfor the presence of narcotine. Concentrated sulphuric acid dissolves\r\nnarcotine; the solution in the cold is at first colourless, after a few\r\nminutes yellow, and in the course of a day or longer the tints gradually\r\ndeepen. If the solution is warmed, it first becomes orange-red, then at\r\nthe margin violet-blue; and if heated until hydric sulphate begins to\r\nvolatilise, the colour is an intense red-violet. If the heating is not\r\ncarried so far, but the solution allowed to cool, a delicate cherry-red\r\nhue slowly develops. If the sulphuric acid solution contains 1 : 2000 of\r\nthe alkaloid, this test is very evident; with 1 : 40,000, the colour is\r\nonly a faint carmine.--_A. Husemann._\r\n\r\nA solution of narcotine in pure sulphuric acid, to which a drop of\r\nnitric acid has been added, becomes of a red colour; if the solution is\r\nwarmed to 150°, hypochlorite of soda develops a carmine-red; and\r\nchloride of iron, first a violet, then a cherry-red. The precipitants of\r\nnarcotine are--phosphomolybdic acid, picric acid, sulphocyanide of\r\npotash, potassio cadmic iodide, mercuric chloride, platinic chloride,\r\nauric chloride, and several other reagents.\r\n\r\nFrom the brown mass left after heating narcotine above 200°,\r\nhydrochloric acid extracts a small portion of a base but little studied.\r\nThe residue consists of humopic acid (C₄₀H₁₉O₁₄), which can be obtained\r\nby dissolving in caustic potash, precipitating with HCl, dissolving the\r\nprecipitate in boiling alcohol, and finally throwing it down by water.\r\n\r\n§ 367. =Effects.=--Narcotine in itself has toxic action only in rather\r\nlarge doses; from 1 to 2 grms. have been given to man, and slight\r\nhypnotic effects have followed. It is poisonous in very large doses; an\r\nordinary-sized cat is killed by 3 grms. The symptoms are mainly\r\nconvulsions.\r\n\r\n§ 368. =Codeine= (=Codomethylene=), C₁₇H₁₇OCH₃(OH)NO + H₂O, is the\r\nmethyl of morphine; it is an alkaloid contained in opium in small\r\nquantity only. Mulder, indeed, quotes ·66 to ·77 per cent. as present in\r\nSmyrna opium, but Merck and Schindler give ·25 per cent. Schindler found\r\nin Constantinople, ·5 per cent.; and Merck, in Bengal, ·5 per cent.\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nCodeine crystallises out of dry ether in small, colourless, anhydrous,\r\ncrystals; but crystallised slowly from an aqueous solution, the crystals\r\nare either in well-defined octahedra, or in prisms, containing one atom\r\nof water, and melting in boiling-water to an oily fluid. The anhydrous\r\ncrystals have a melting-point of 150°, and solidify again on cooling.\r\nIts watery solution is alkaline to litmus paper.\r\n\r\nIt requires 80 parts of cold, 17 of boiling water, 10 parts of benzole,\r\nand 7 parts of amyl alcohol respectively, for solution. Alcohol,\r\nbenzene, ether, carbon disulphide, and chloroform freely dissolve it,\r\nbut in petroleum ether it is almost insoluble. Further, it is also\r\nsoluble in aqueous ammonia, and in dilute acids, but insoluble in\r\nexcess of caustic potash or soda, and may thus be thrown out of an\r\naqueous solution. A solution of codeine turns the plane of polarisation\r\nto the left, [α]_r_ = 118·2°.\r\n\r\nConcentrated sulphuric acid dissolves codeine without colour, but after\r\neight days the solution becomes blue; this reaction is quicker if the\r\nacid contains a trace of nitric acid. If the sulphuric acid solution be\r\nwarmed to 150°, and a drop of nitric acid be added after cooling, a\r\nblood-red colour is produced. Fröhde’s reagent produces a dirty green\r\ncolour, soon becoming Prussian blue, and terminating after twenty-four\r\nhours in a pale yellow.\r\n\r\nCyanogen gas, led into an alcoholic solution of codeine, gives first a\r\nyellow and then a brown colour; lastly, a crystalline precipitate falls.\r\nOn warming with a little sulphuric acid and ferric chloride, a blue\r\ncolour is produced. This blue colour is apparently common to all ethers\r\nof the codeine class.\r\n\r\nOf the group reagents, the following precipitate solutions of\r\ncodeine:--Mercuric potassium iodide, mercuric chloride, mercuric\r\nbromide, picric acid, and tannin solutions. The following do not\r\nprecipitate:--Mercuric cyanide and potassium ferrocyanide solutions.\r\nPotassium dichromate gives no immediate precipitate, but crystals form\r\non long standing. It does not give the reaction with iodic acid like\r\nmorphine; it is distinguished from narceine by dropping a small particle\r\nof iodine into the aqueous solution, the iodine particle does not become\r\nsurrounded with fine crystals.\r\n\r\n§ 369. =Effects.=--The physiological action of codeine on animals has\r\nbeen investigated by Claude Bernard, Magendie, Crum Brown and Fraser,\r\nFalck, and a large number of others.[405] It has also been administered\r\nto man, and has taken in some degree the place of morphine. Claude\r\nBernard showed that, when given to dogs in sufficient quantity to\r\nproduce sleep, the sleep was different in some respects to that of\r\nmorphine sleep, especially in its after-effects. Thus, in his usual\r\ngraphic way, he describes the following experiment:--“Two young dogs,\r\naccustomed to play together, and both a little beyond the average size,\r\nreceived in the cellular tissue of the axillæ, by the aid of a\r\nsubcutaneous syringe, the one 5 centigrammes of morphine hydrochloride,\r\nthe other 5 centigrammes of codeine hydrochloride. At the end of a\r\nquarter of an hour both dogs showed signs of narcosis. They were placed\r\non their backs in the experimental trough, and slept tranquilly for\r\nthree or four hours. When the animals woke, they presented the most\r\nstriking contrast. The morphine dog ran with a hyena-like gait\r\n(_démarche hyénoid_), the eye wild, recognising no one, not even his\r\ncodeine comrade, who vainly bit him playfully, and jumped sportively on\r\nhis back. It was not until the next day that the morphine dog regained\r\nhis spirits and usual humour. A couple of days after, the two dogs being\r\nin good health, I repeated the same experiment, but in an inverse\r\norder--that is to say, I gave the codeine to that which previously had\r\nthe morphine, and _vice versâ_. Both dogs slept about as long as the\r\nfirst time; but on waking the attitudes were completely reversed, just\r\nas the administration of the two substances had been. The dog which, two\r\ndays before, after having been codeinised, woke lively and gay, was now\r\nbewildered and half paralysed at the end of his morphine sleep; whilst\r\nthe other was wide awake and in the best spirits.”\r\n\r\n[405] _Ann. Chem. Phys._ [5], 27, pp. 273-288; also, _Journ. Chem.\r\nSoc._, No. ccxliv., 1883, p. 358.\r\n\r\nSubsequent experimenters found what Bernard does not mention--viz., that\r\ncodeine produced epileptiform convulsions. Falck made some very careful\r\nexperiments on pigeons, frogs, and rabbits. To all these in high enough\r\ndoses it was fatal. Falk puts the minimum lethal dose for a rabbit at\r\n51·2 mgrms. per kilo. Given to man, it produces a sleep very similar to\r\nthat described by Claude Bernard--that is, a sleep which is very\r\nnatural, and does not leave any after-effect. Therefore it is declared\r\nto be the best alkaloid of a narcotic nature to give when lengthened\r\nslumber is desired, more especially since it does not confine the\r\nbowels, nor has it been found to produce any eruption on the skin.\r\nBefore it has a full narcotic effect, vomiting has often been excited,\r\nand in a few cases purging. The maximum dose for an adult is about ·1\r\ngrm. (1·5 grain); three times this quantity, ·3 grms. (4-5 grains),\r\nwould probably produce unpleasant, if not dangerous, symptoms.[406]\r\n\r\n[406] For further details as to the action of codeine, the reader is\r\nreferred to L. O. Wach’s monograph, _Das Codein_ (1868), which contains\r\nreference to the earlier literature. See also Harley, _The Old Vegetable\r\nNeurotics_, London.\r\n\r\n    § 370. =Narceine=, C₂₃H₂₇NO₈ + 3H₂O.--Two of the three molecules of\r\n    water are expelled at 100°, the other molecule requires a higher\r\n    temperature; anhydrous narceine is hygroscopic, and melts in a tube\r\n    at about 140°; when exposed to air it unites with one molecule of\r\n    water, and then melts at about 160°.\r\n\r\n    The constitution of narceine is probably that of a substituted\r\n    phenylbenzylketone, and the following structural formula has been\r\n    attributed to it:[407]--\r\n\r\n[407] M. Freund and G. B. Frankforter, _Annalen_, 277, pp. 20-58.\r\n\r\n      3       I:2   4  1’         2’\r\n    COOH,C₆H₂-(OMe)₂CO-CH₂-C₆H(CH₂-CH₂NMe₂)\r\n         O\r\n  3 or 6/ \\\r\n     OMe   CH₂\r\n        \\ /\r\n         O\r\n\r\n    It therefore contains three methoxyl groups.\r\n\r\n    Narceine forms good crystals, the form being that of long,\r\n    four-sided rhombic prisms or fine bushy united needles.\r\n\r\n    Narceine hydrochloride crystallises with 5½H₂O and with 3H₂O; the\r\n    anhydrous salt melts at 190°-192°. The platinochloride is a definite\r\n    salt, m.p. 190°-191°; it decomposes at 195°-196°. The nitrate forms\r\n    good crystals, which decompose at 97°. Narceine also forms\r\n    crystalline salts with potassium and sodium; these may be obtained\r\n    by heating the base at 60°-70° with a 33 per cent. of NaHO or KHO.\r\n\r\n    The potassium compound melts at 90°, the sodium at 159°-160°. The\r\n    alkaloid is regenerated when the alkali salts are treated with acids\r\n    or with CO₂. Crude narceine may be purified by means of the sodium\r\n    salt; the latter is dissolved in alcohol and precipitated with\r\n    ether.\r\n\r\n    It is soluble in alcohol, but almost insoluble in alcohol and ether,\r\n    or benzene and ether; it is slightly soluble in ether, carbon\r\n    disulphide, and chloroform. It has no reaction on moist litmus\r\n    paper.\r\n\r\n    Benzole and petroleum ether extract narceine neither from acid nor\r\n    alkaline solutions; chloroform extracts narceine both from acid and\r\n    from alkaline solutions, the latter in small proportion only.\r\n    Narceine turns the plane of polarisation to the left, [α]_r_ =\r\n    66·7°. Narceine may be separated from narcotine by the addition of\r\n    ammonia to the acid aqueous solution; narcotine is fully\r\n    precipitated by ammonia, but narceine is left in solution.\r\n\r\n    In the subliming cell it melts at 134°, but gives no crystalline\r\n    sublimate. The tube melting-point of the trihydrate is 170°. The\r\n    melted substance is at first colourless; but on raising the\r\n    temperature, the usual transitions of colour through different\r\n    shades of brown to black are observed. If melted, and kept a few\r\n    degrees above its melting-point, and then cooled slowly, the residue\r\n    is straw-coloured, divided into lobes, most of which contain\r\n    feathery crystals.\r\n\r\n    At high temperatures narceine develops a herring-like odour; the\r\n    residue becomes darkish blue with iron chloride. Concentrated nitric\r\n    acid dissolves it with a yellow colour; on heating, red vapours are\r\n    produced; the fluid contains crystals of oxalic acid, and develops\r\n    with potash a volatile base. Concentrated sulphuric acid colours\r\n    pure narceine brown; but if impure, a blood-red or blue colour may\r\n    be produced. It does not reduce iron salts.\r\n\r\n    Fröhde’s reagent colours it first brown-green, then red, passing\r\n    into blue. Narceine forms precipitates with bichromate of potash,\r\n    chloride of gold, bichloride of platinum, and several other\r\n    reagents. The one formed by the addition of potassio zinc iodide is\r\n    in hair-like crystals, which after twenty-four hours become blue.\r\n\r\n    Weak iodine solution colours narceine crystals a black-blue; they\r\n    dissolve in water at 100° without colour, but on cooling again\r\n    separate with a violet or blue colour. If on a saturated solution of\r\n    narceine a particle of iodine is strewn, fine needle-like grey\r\n    crystals form around the iodine. A drop of “Nessler” solution, added\r\n    to solid narceine, at once strikes a brown colour; on diluting the\r\n    drop with a little water, beautiful little bundles of crystals\r\n    appear.--_Flückiger._\r\n\r\n    The following group reagents precipitate narceine:--picric acid,\r\n    tannin solution, and potassium dichromate on long standing. The\r\n    following give no precipitate:--mercuric cyanide, mercuric potas.\r\n    iodide, mercuric chloride, mercuric bromide, and potas. ferrocyanide\r\n    solutions.\r\n\r\n    § 371. =Effects.=--The physiological action of narceine has been\r\n    variously interpreted by different observers. Claude Bernard[408]\r\n    thought it the most somniferous of the opium alkaloids. He said that\r\n    “the narceinic sleep was characterised by a profound calm and\r\n    absence of the excitability of morphine, the animals narcotised by\r\n    narceine on awaking returning to their natural state without\r\n    enfeeblement of the hind limbs or other sequelæ.” It has been amply\r\n    confirmed that narceine possesses somniferous properties, but\r\n    certainly not to the extent that Bernard’s observations led\r\n    physiologists to expect. In large doses there is some irritation of\r\n    the stomach and intestines, and vomiting occurs, and even diarrhœa;\r\n    moderate doses induce constipation. The maximum medicinal dose may\r\n    be put at ·14 grm. (or 2·26 grains), and a probably dangerous dose\r\n    would be three times that quantity.[409]\r\n\r\n[408] _Compt. Rend._, lix. p. 406, 1864.\r\n\r\n[409] See J. Bouchardat, _La Narcéine_, Thèse, Paris, 1865; Harley, _The\r\nOld Vegetable Neurotics_, Lond.; Ch. Liné, _Études sur la Narcéine et\r\nson Emploi Thérapeutique_, Thèse, Paris, 1865; also, Husemann’s\r\n_Planzenstoffe_, in which these and other researches are summarised.\r\n\r\n    § 372. =Papaverine= (C₂₁H₂₁NO₄) crystallises from alcohol in white\r\n    needles or scales. It possesses scarcely any alkaline reaction, but\r\n    its salts have an acid reaction; it has but little effect on a ray\r\n    of polarised light. It is almost insoluble in water; it is easily\r\n    soluble in acetone, amyl alcohol, alcohol, and chloroform. One part\r\n    of the alkaloid is dissolved in 36·6 of benzene, and in 76 parts of\r\n    amyl alcohol. Petroleum ether dissolves it by the aid of heat, but\r\n    the alkaloid separates in crystals on cooling. Chloroform extracts\r\n    it from either acid or alkaline solutions. Papaverine gives no\r\n    crystalline sublimate. The melting-point of pure samples in a tube\r\n    is 147°, with scarcely any colour; it solidifies again to crystals\r\n    on cooling; in the subliming cell it melts at 130°, and decomposes\r\n    about 149°; the vapours are alkaline; the residue is amorphous,\r\n    light brown, and is not characteristic. Concentrated sulphuric acid\r\n    colours it a deep violet-blue, and dissolves it to a violet, slowly\r\n    fading. This solution, by permanganate of potash, is first green and\r\n    then grey. Fröhde’s reagent gives a beautiful violet colour, which\r\n    becomes blue, and vanishes after twenty-four hours. Diluted\r\n    solutions of salts of papaverine are not precipitated by\r\n    phosphomolybdic acid. It is precipitated by ammonia, by the caustic\r\n    and carbonated alkalies, by potassic-cadmic iodide, iodine in\r\n    hydriodic acid, and by alkaloidal reagents generally--save by the\r\n    important exception mentioned above. A solution in amyl alcohol is\r\n    also precipitated by bromine; the precipitate is crystalline. An\r\n    alcoholic solution of platinic chloride also separates papaverine\r\n    platin chloride in crystals. An alcoholic solution of iodine, added\r\n    to an alcoholic solution of papaverine, separates in a little time\r\n    crystals of the composition C₂₁H₂₁NO₄I₃. From the mother-liquor, by\r\n    concentration, can be obtained needles of another iodine\r\n    combination, C₂₁H₂₁NO₄I₅; the latter heated above 100° parts with\r\n    free iodine. These compounds with iodine are decomposed by ammonia\r\n    and potash, papaverine separating. The decomposition may be watched\r\n    under the microscope. Nitric acid precipitates from a solution of\r\n    the sulphate a white nitrate soluble in excess; the precipitate does\r\n    not appear at once, but forms in the course of an hour; it is at\r\n    first amorphous, but subsequently crystalline; this, with its\r\n    physical properties, is a great assistance to identification.\r\n\r\n    § 373. =Effects.=--Claude Bernard ranked papaverine with the\r\n    convulsants; probably the papaverine he had was impure. In any case,\r\n    subsequent observations have shown that it is to be classed rather\r\n    with the hypnotic principles of opium. Leidesdorf[410] administered\r\n    it to the insane, and noted slowness of the pulse, muscular\r\n    weakness, and drowsiness to follow. The doses were given\r\n    subcutaneously (·42 grm. of the hydrochloride). Baxt,[411]\r\n    experimenting with the frog, found that a milligramme caused deep\r\n    sleep and slowing of the heart’s action. This action on the heart is\r\n    witnessed also on the recently-removed frog’s heart. Guinea-pigs,\r\n    and other small animals poisoned by strychnine or thebaine, and then\r\n    given papaverine, did not seem to be so soon affected with tetanus\r\n    as when no such remedy was administered. The fatal dose of\r\n    papaverine for a man is unknown. I should conjecture that the least\r\n    quantity that would cause dangerous symptoms would be 1 grm. (15·4\r\n    grains).\r\n\r\n[410] _Ztschr. d. Wien. Aerzte_, pp. 13, 115, 1868.\r\n\r\n[411] _Arch. Anat. Phys._, p. 70, 1869.\r\n\r\n    § 374. =Thebaine=, C₁₇H₁₅NO(OCH₃)₂.--Opium seldom contains much more\r\n    than 1 per cent. of this alkaloid. It usually forms needles or short\r\n    crystals. It is alkaline, and by rubbing becomes negatively\r\n    electric. It is almost insoluble in water, aqueous ammonia, and\r\n    solutions of the alkalies. It requires 10 parts of cold alcohol for\r\n    solution, and dissolves readily in hot. Ether, hot or cold, is also\r\n    a good solvent. 100 parts of benzene are required for 5·27 parts of\r\n    thebaine, and 100 of amyl alcohol for 1·67 parts. Chloroform\r\n    dissolves thebaine with difficulty out of both acid and alkaline\r\n    solutions; petroleum ether extracts it from neither. Thebaine melts\r\n    in a tube at 193°, sublimes at 135°. The sublimate is in minute\r\n    crystals, similar to theine; at higher temperatures (160° to 200°)\r\n    needles, cubes, and prisms are obtained. The residue is fawn\r\n    coloured. Fröhde’s reagent (as well as concentrated sulphuric acid)\r\n    dissolves it, with the production of a blood-red colour, passing\r\n    gradually into yellow. The precipitate with picric acid is yellow\r\n    and amorphous; with tannic acid yellow; with gold chloride,\r\n    red-yellow; and with platinic chloride, citron-yellow, gradually\r\n    becoming crystalline. A concentrated alcoholic solution of thebaine,\r\n    just neutralised with HCl, deposits well-formed rhombic crystals of\r\n    the composition C₁₉H₂₁NO₃HCl + H₂O.\r\n\r\n    If 200 mgrms. of thebaine are heated to boiling with 1·4 c.c. of HCl\r\n    and 2·8 c.c. of water, and the solution diluted, after boiling, with\r\n    4 c.c. of water, crystals of thebaine hydrochloride form in the\r\n    yellow fluid in the course of a few hours.--_Flückiger._\r\n\r\n    § 375. =Effects.=--There is no disagreement of opinion as to the\r\n    action of thebaine. By the united testimony of all who have\r\n    experimented with it, the alkaloid belongs to those poisons which\r\n    produce tetanus, and the symptoms can scarcely be differentiated\r\n    from strychnia. In Baxt’s experiments on frogs he showed that there\r\n    was some considerable difference in details in the general course of\r\n    the symptoms, according to the dose of the poison. A small dose\r\n    (such, for example, as ·75 mgrm.) injected into a frog\r\n    subcutaneously produces immediate excitement, the animal jumping\r\n    about, and this stage lasting for about a minute; it then becomes\r\n    quieter, and has from three to six minutes’ sleep; in a little time\r\n    this comatose state is followed by reflex tetanic spasms and then\r\n    spontaneous tetanic spasms. With three times the dose, the tetanic\r\n    convulsions commence early, and death takes place in from two to six\r\n    hours. Baxt[412] found 6 to 7 mgrms. kill rabbits with tetanic\r\n    convulsions in from fifteen to twenty-five minutes. Crum Brown and\r\n    Fraser also found that 12 mgrms. injected into rabbits were fatal;\r\n    it may then be presumed that the lethal dose for a rabbit is about 5\r\n    mgrms. per kilo. A frog’s heart under the action of thebaine, and\r\n    removed from the body, beats quicker and ceases earlier than one in\r\n    distilled water. Thebaine has been administered to the insane\r\n    subcutaneously in doses of from 12 to 40 mgrms., when a rise of\r\n    temperature and an increase in the respiratory movements and in the\r\n    circulation were noticed.[413]\r\n\r\n[412] _Sitzungsber. d. Wien. Akadem._, lvi. pp. 2, 89, 1867; _Arch. f.\r\nAnat. u. Physiol._, Hft. 1, p. 112, 1869.\r\n\r\n[413] F. W. Müller, _Das Thebaine, eine Monographie_, Diss., Marburg\r\n1868.\r\n\r\n    The fatal dose for a man is not known; ·5 grm., or about 8 grains,\r\n    would probably be a poisonous quantity.\r\n\r\n    § 376. =Cryptopine= (C₂₁H₂₃NO₅) was discovered by T. & H. Smith in\r\n    1867.[414] It is only contained in very minute traces in\r\n    opium--something like ·003 per cent. It is a crystalline substance,\r\n    the crystals being colourless, six-sided prisms, without odour, but\r\n    with a bitter taste, causing an after-sensation like peppermint. The\r\n    crystals melt at 217°, and congeal in a crystalline form again at\r\n    171°; at high temperatures they are decomposed with evolution of\r\n    ammoniacal vapour. Cryptopine is insoluble, or almost so, in ether,\r\n    water, and oil of turpentine; it is soluble in acetone, benzene, and\r\n    chloroform; the latter is the best solvent, or hot alcohol; it is\r\n    insoluble in aqueous ammonia and in solutions of the caustic\r\n    alkaloids. Cryptopine is strongly basic, neutralising fully mineral\r\n    acids. Concentrated sulphuric acid colours cryptopine pure blue, the\r\n    tint gradually fading from absorption of water from the atmosphere.\r\n    On a crystal of potassic nitrate being added, the colour changes\r\n    into a permanent green. With ferric chloride cryptopine gives no\r\n    colour--thus distinguishing it from morphine. The physiological\r\n    properties of cryptopine have been investigated by Dr. Harley;[415]\r\n    it has a narcotic action, about double as strong as narceine, and\r\n    four times weaker than morphine. Munk and Sippell[416] found that it\r\n    gave rise in animals to paralysis of the limbs, and occasionally\r\n    asphyxic convulsions before death.\r\n\r\n[414] _Pharm. Journ. Trans._ [2], viii. pp. 495 and 716.\r\n\r\n[415] _The Old Vegetable Neurotics._\r\n\r\n[416] Munk, _Versuche über die Wirkung des Cryptopins_, Berlin, 1873.\r\nSippell, _Beiträge zur Kentniss des Cryptopins_, Marburg, 1874.\r\n\r\n    § 377. =Rhœadine= (C₂₁H₂₁NO₆).--Rhœadine was separated from _Papaver\r\n    rhœas_ by Hesse, and has also been found in _Papaver somniferum_ and\r\n    in opium. Rhœadine is in the form of small anhydrous tasteless\r\n    prisms, melting at 230° and partly subliming. In a vacuum\r\n    sublimation is almost complete, and at a much lower temperature. It\r\n    is a very insoluble substance, and is scarcely dissolved, when\r\n    crystalline, by water, alcohol, ether, chloroform, benzene, and\r\n    solutions of the fixed or volatile alkalies. When in an amorphous\r\n    state it is rather soluble in ether, and may be dissolved out of any\r\n    substance by treating with dilute acetic acid, and neutralising by\r\n    ammonia, and shaking up with ether before the precipitate becomes\r\n    crystalline. Rhœadine is easily recognised by its striking a red\r\n    colour with hydrochloric acid. Either spontaneously or on gentle\r\n    warming, the colour is produced--one part of rhœadine will colour in\r\n    this way 10,000 parts of acid water blue or purple-red, 200,000\r\n    rose-red, and 800,000 pale red. The reaction depends on a splitting\r\n    up of the rhœadine into a colourless substance, _rhœadin_, and a red\r\n    colouring-matter. Rhœadine is not poisonous.\r\n\r\n    § 378. =Pseudomorphine= (C₁₇H₁₉NO₄).--Pseudomorphine was discovered\r\n    by Pelletier and Thiboumery in 1835. As precipitated by ammonia out\r\n    of the hot solution, pseudomorphine falls as a white crystalline\r\n    precipitate; but if the solution is cold, the precipitate is\r\n    gelatinous. It possesses no taste, and has no action on vegetable\r\n    colours. On heating, it decomposes and then melts. It dissolves\r\n    easily in caustic alkalies and in milk of lime, but is insoluble in\r\n    all the ordinary alcoholic and ethereal solvents, as well as in\r\n    diluted sulphuric acid. The most soluble salt is the hydrochlorate\r\n    (C₁₇H₁₉NO₄HCl + H₂O), and that requires 70 parts of water at 20° for\r\n    solution. Various salts, such as the sulphate, oxalate, &c., may be\r\n    prepared from the hydrochlorate by double decomposition.\r\n    Concentrated sulphuric acid dissolves pseudomorphine gradually, with\r\n    the production of an olive-green colour.\r\n\r\n    § 379. =Opianine= (C₆₆H₇₂N₄O₂₁).--Opianine crystallises in\r\n    colourless, glittering ortho-rhombic needles. Ammonia precipitates\r\n    it from its solution in hydrochloric acid as a fine white powder. It\r\n    is without odour, and has a bitter taste. It is a strong base, and\r\n    is soluble in cold, but slightly soluble in boiling water. It is\r\n    also but little soluble in boiling alcohol.\r\n\r\n    An alcoholic solution of the alkaloid gives a voluminous precipitate\r\n    with mercuric chloride; after standing a little time, the\r\n    precipitate becomes crystalline, the crystals being in the shape of\r\n    fine needles. They have the following composition--C₆₆H₇₂N₄O₂₁,\r\n    2HCl, 2HgCl--and are with difficulty soluble in water or alcohol.\r\n\r\n    Opianine, administered to cats in doses of ·145 grm., produces\r\n    complex symptoms--_e.g._, dilated pupils, foaming at the mouth,\r\n    uncertain gait, paralysis of the hinder extremities, and stupor--but\r\n    the alkaloid is rare, and few experiments have been made with it.\r\n\r\n    § 380. =Apomorphine= (C₁₇H₁₉NO₃).--Apomorphine is a derivative of\r\n    morphine, and is readily prepared by saponifying morphine by heating\r\n    it with dilute hydrochloric acid in sealed tubes. The result is\r\n    apomorphine hydrochloride, the morphine losing one molecule of\r\n    water, according to the equation C₁₇H₁₉NO₃ = C₁₇H₁₇NO₂ + H₂O.\r\n\r\n    To extract apomorphine, the bases are precipitated by sodic\r\n    bicarbonate, and the precipitate extracted by ether or chloroform,\r\n    either of which solvents leaves morphine undissolved. The\r\n    apomorphine is again converted into hydrochloride, and once more\r\n    precipitated by sodic bicarbonate, and is lastly obtained as a\r\n    snow-white substance, rapidly becoming green on exposure to the air.\r\n    The mass dissolves with a beautiful green colour in water, and also\r\n    in alcohol, whilst it colours ether purple-red, and chloroform\r\n    violet.\r\n\r\n    A test for apomorphine is the following:--The chloride is dissolved\r\n    in a little acetic acid and shaken with a crystal of potassic iodate\r\n    (KIO₃); this immediately turns red from liberated iodine on shaking\r\n    it up with a little chloroform; on standing, the chloroform sinks to\r\n    the bottom, and is coloured by the alkaloid a beautiful blue colour;\r\n    on now carefully pouring a little CS₂ on the surface of the liquid\r\n    at the point of junction it is coloured amethyst owing to dissolved\r\n    iodine, and apocodeine gives a similar reaction.\r\n\r\n    Apomorphine is the purest and most active emetic known: whether\r\n    injected beneath the skin or taken by the mouth, the effect is the\r\n    same--there is considerable depression, faintness, and then\r\n    vomiting. The dose for an adult is about 6 mgrms. (·092 grain)\r\n    subcutaneously administered.\r\n\r\n    § 381. The reactions of some of the rarer alkaloids of opium with\r\n    sulphuric acid and ferric chloride are as follows: none of them have\r\n    at present any toxicological importance:--\r\n\r\nTABLE SHOWING SOME OF THE REACTIONS OF THE RARER ALKALOIDS OF OPIUM.\r\n\r\n  +---------------+---------+----------------------+----------------+\r\n  |   Alkaloid.   |Formula. |  Reaction with Warm  | Reaction with  |\r\n  |               |         |   Sulphuric Acid.    |Ferric Chloride.|\r\n  +---------------+---------+----------------------+----------------+\r\n  |Codamine,      |C₂₀H₂₅NO₄ {|Dirty red-violet      |}               |\r\n  |               |        {|colour, turning dark  |} Dark green.   |\r\n  |Landamine,     |C₂₀H₂₅NO₄ {|violet on the         |}               |\r\n  |               |        {|addition of HNO₃.     |}               |\r\n  |               |         |                      |                |\r\n  |Landanosine,   |C₂₀H₂₇NO₄ }|Dirty green to        |}               |\r\n  |               |        }|brownish-green.       |} No colour.    |\r\n  |Protapine,     |C₂₀H₁₉NO₅ }|                      |}               |\r\n  |               |         |                      |                |\r\n  |Lanthopine,    |C₂₃H₂₅NO₄  |Dark brown or black.  |  No colour.    |\r\n  |               |         |                      |                |\r\n  |Hydrocotarnine,|C₁₂H₁₅NO₃ {|Dirty red-violet;     |}               |\r\n  |               |        {|not changed by        |} No colour.    |\r\n  |               |        {|trace of HNO₃.        |}               |\r\n  +---------------+---------+----------------------+----------------+\r\n\r\n    § 382. =Tritopine= (C₄₂H₅₄N₂O₇).--This is a rare alkaloid that has\r\n    been found in small quantities in opium. It is crystalline,\r\n    separating in transparent prisms. Melting-point 182°. It is soluble\r\n    in alcohol and chloroform, and slightly soluble in ether.[417]\r\n\r\n[417] E. Kander, _Arch. Pharm._, 228, pp. 419-431.\r\n\r\n    § 383. =Meconin (Opianyl)= (C₁₀H₁₀O₄) is in the form of white\r\n    glittering needles, which melt under water at 77° and in air at 90°,\r\n    again coagulating at 75°. It may be sublimed in beautiful crystals.\r\n    It is soluble in 22 parts of boiling, and 700 of cold water;\r\n    dissolves easily in alcohol, ether, acetic acid, and ethereal oil,\r\n    and is not precipitated by acetate of lead. Its solution in\r\n    concentrated sulphuric acid becomes, on warming, purple, and gives,\r\n    on the addition of water, a brown precipitate. Meconin may be\r\n    prepared by treating narcotine with nitric acid. Meconin, in large\r\n    doses, is a feeble narcotic; 1·25 grm. (20 grains) has been given to\r\n    man without result.\r\n\r\n    § 384. =Meconic Acid= (C₇H₄O₇) crystallises in white shining scales\r\n    or small rhombic prisms, with three atoms of water (C₇H₄O₇ + 3H₂O),\r\n    but at 100° this is lost, and it becomes an opaque white mass. It\r\n    reddens litmus, and has a sourish taste. It is soluble in 115 parts\r\n    of cold, but dissolves in 4 parts of boiling water; it dissolves\r\n    easily in alcohol, less so in ether. It forms well-marked salts; the\r\n    barium and calcium salt crystallise with one atom of water, the\r\n    former having the composition BaH₄(C₇HO₇)₂; the latter, if ammonium\r\n    meconate is precipitated by calcium chloride, CaH₄(C₇HO₇)₂; but if\r\n    calcium chloride is added to the acid itself, the salt has the\r\n    composition C₇H₂CaO₇ + H₂O. If meconic acid is gently heated, it\r\n    decomposes into carbon dioxide and comenic acid (C₆H₄O₅). If the\r\n    heat is stronger, pyromeconic acid (C₅H₄O₃)--carbon dioxide, water,\r\n    acetic acid, and benzole are formed. Pyromeconic acid is readily\r\n    sublimed in large transparent tables. Chloride of iron, and soluble\r\n    iron salts generally, give with meconic acid (even in great\r\n    dilution) a lively red colour, which is not altered by heat, nor by\r\n    the addition of HCl nor by that of gold chloride. Sugar of lead and\r\n    nitrate of silver each give a white precipitate; and mercurous and\r\n    mercuric nitrates white and yellow precipitates. In any case where\r\n    the analyst has found only meconic acid, the question may be raised\r\n    in court as to whether it is a poison or not. The early experiments\r\n    of Sertürner,[418] Langer, Vogel, Sömmering, and Grape[419] showed\r\n    that, in comparatively speaking large doses, it had but little, if\r\n    any, action on dogs or men. Albers[420] has, however, experimented\r\n    on frogs, and found that in doses of ·1 to ·2 grm. there is, first,\r\n    a narcotic action, and later, convulsions and death. According to\r\n    Schroff,[421] there is a slight narcotic action on man.\r\n\r\n[418] _Ann. Phys._, xxv. 56; xxvii. 183.\r\n\r\n[419] _De opio et de illis quibus constat partibus_, Berol., 1822.\r\n\r\n[420] _Arch. Path. Anat._, xxvi. 248.\r\n\r\n[421] _Med. Jahresb._, 1869.\r\n\r\nThe most generally accepted view at the present time is that the\r\nphysiological action of meconic acid is similar to that of lactic\r\nacid--viz., large doses cause some depression and feeble narcosis.\r\n\r\nIn a special research amongst organic fluids for meconic acid, the\r\nsubstances are extracted by alcohol _feebly_ acidulated with nitric\r\nacid; on filtration the alcohol, after the addition of a little water,\r\nis distilled off, and to the remaining fluid a solution of acetate of\r\nlead is added, and the whole filtered. The filtrate will contain any\r\nalkaloids, whilst meconic acid, if present, is bound up with the lead on\r\nthe filter. The meconate of lead may be either washed or digested in\r\nstrong acetic acid to purify it, suspended in water, and freed from lead\r\nby SH₂; the filtrate from the lead sulphide may be tested by ferric\r\nchloride, or preferably, at once evaporated to dryness, and weighed.\r\nAfter this operation it is identified. If the quantity is so small that\r\nit cannot be conveniently weighed, it may be estimated colorimetrically,\r\nby having a standard solution of meconic acid, containing 1 mgrm. in\r\nevery c.c. A few drops of neutral ferric chloride are added in a Nessler\r\ncylinder to the liquid under examination; and the tint thus obtained is\r\nimitated in the usual way, in another cylinder, by means of ferric\r\nchloride, the standard solution, and water. It is also obvious that the\r\nweight of the meconic acid may be increased by converting it into the\r\nbarium salt--100 parts of anhydrous baric meconate, (Ba₂C₇H₂O₇), being\r\nequivalent to 42·3 of meconic acid (C₇H₄O₇).\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.--The Strychnine or Tetanus-Producing[422] Group of Alkaloids.\r\n\r\n[422] To this group also belong some of the opium alkaloids. See\r\n“Thebaine,” “Landamine,” “Codeine,” “Hydrocotarnine.”\r\n\r\n\r\n1. NUX VOMICA GROUP--STRYCHNINE--BRUCINE--IGASURINE.\r\n\r\n§ 385. Nux vomica is found in commerce both in the entire state and as a\r\npowder. It is the seed of the _Strychnos nux vomica_, or Koochla tree.\r\nThe seed is about the size of a shilling, round, flattened,\r\nconcavo-convex, of a yellowish-grey or light-brown colour, covered with\r\na velvety down of fine, radiating, silky hairs, which are coloured by a\r\nsolution of iodine beautiful gold-yellow; the texture is tough,\r\nleathery, and not easily pulverised; the taste is intensely bitter. The\r\npowder is not unlike that of liquorice, and, if met with in the pure\r\nstate, gives a dark orange-red colour with nitric acid, which is\r\ndestroyed by chloride of tin; the aqueous infusion gives a precipitate\r\nwith tincture of galls, is reddened by nitric acid, and gives an\r\nolive-green tint with persulphate of iron. The best method, however, of\r\nrecognising quickly and with certainty that the substance under\r\nexamination is nux vomica powder, is to extract strychnine from it by\r\nthe following simple process:--The powder is completely exhausted by\r\nboiling alcohol (90 per cent.), the alcoholic extract evaporated to\r\ndryness, and then treated with water; the aqueous solution is passed\r\nthrough a wet filter, and concentrated by evaporation to a small bulk.\r\nTo this liquid a drop or so of a concentrated solution of picric acid is\r\nadded, and the yellow precipitate of picrates thus obtained is\r\nseparated, treated with nitric acid, the picric acid removed by ether,\r\nand the pure alkaloid precipitated by soda, and shaken out by\r\nchloroform.\r\n\r\n§ 386. =Chemical Composition.=--Nux vomica contains at least four\r\ndistinct principles:--\r\n\r\n  (1.) Strychnine.\r\n  (2.) Brucine.\r\n  (3.) Igasurine.\r\n  (4.) Strychnic or igasuric acid.\r\n\r\n§ 387. =Strychnine= (C₂₁H₂₂N₂O₂) is contained in the bean of S.\r\n_ignatius_, in the bark (_false angustura bark_) and seeds of the\r\n_Strychnos nux vomica_, in the _Strychnos colubrina_, L., in the\r\n_Strychnos tieuté_, Lesch, and probably in various other plants of the\r\nsame genus.\r\n\r\nCommercial strychnine is met with either in colourless crystals or as a\r\nwhite powder, the most usual form being that of the alkaloid itself; but\r\nthe nitrate, sulphate, and acetate are also sold to a small extent.\r\n\r\nThe _microscopical appearance_ of strychnine, as thrown down by the\r\nsolution of vapour of ammonia, may be referred to three leading\r\nforms--the long rectangular prism, the short hexagonal prism, or the\r\nregular octahedron. If obtained from the slow evaporation of an\r\nalcoholic solution, it is usually in the form of four-sided pyramids or\r\nlong prisms; but if obtained by speedy evaporation or rapid cooling, it\r\nappears as a white granular powder. If obtained from a benzene solution,\r\nthe deposit is usually crystalline, but without a constant form, though\r\nat times the crystals are extremely distinct, the short six-sided prism\r\nprevailing; but triangular plates, dodecahedral, rhomboidal, and\r\npentagonal, may also be met with. An ethereal solution on evaporation\r\nassumes dendritic forms, but may contain octahedra and four-sided\r\nprisms. A chloroform solution deposits rosettes, veined leaves, stellate\r\ndotted needles, circles with broken radii, and branched and reticulated\r\nforms of great delicacy and beauty.--_Guy._\r\n\r\nStrychnine is very insoluble in water, although readily dissolved by\r\nacidulated water. According to Wormley’s repeated experiments, one part\r\nof strychnine dissolves in 8333 parts of cold water; and, according to\r\nPelletier and Cahours, it dissolves in 6667 parts of cold, and 2500\r\nparts of boiling water. It may be convenient, then, to remember that a\r\ngallon of cold water would hardly dissolve more than 10 grains (·142\r\ngrm. per litre); the same amount, if boiling, about 30 grains (·426 grm.\r\nper litre) of strychnine. The solubility of one part of strychnine in\r\nother menstrua is as follows:--Cold alcohol, 0·833 specific gravity,\r\n120, boiling, 10 parts (_Wittstein_); cold alcohol, 0·936 specific\r\ngravity, 240 parts (_Merck_); cold alcohol, 0·815 specific gravity, 107\r\nparts (_Dragendorff_); amyl alcohol, 181 parts; benzene, 164;\r\nchloroform, 6·9 (_Schlimpert_), 5 (_Pettenkofer_); ether, 1250 parts;\r\ncarbon disulphide, 485 parts; glycerin, 300 parts. Creosote and\r\nessential and fixed oils also dissolve strychnine.\r\n\r\nOf all the above solvents, it is evident that chloroform is the best for\r\npurposes of separation, and next to chloroform, benzene.\r\n\r\nIf a speck of strychnine be placed in the subliming cell, it will be\r\nfound to sublime usually in a crystalline form at 169°. A common form at\r\nthis temperature, according to the writer’s own observations, is minute\r\nneedles, disposed in lines; but, as Dr. Guy has remarked, the sublimate\r\nmay consist of drops, of waving patterns, and various other forms; and,\r\nfurther, while the sublimates of morphia are made up of curved lines,\r\nthose of strychnine consist of lines either straight or slightly\r\ncurved, with parallel feathery lines at right angles. On continuing the\r\nheat, strychnine melts at about 221°, and the lower disc, if removed and\r\nexamined, is found to have a resinous residue; but it still continues to\r\nyield sublimates until reduced to a spot of carbon. The melting-point\r\ntaken in a tube is 268°.\r\n\r\nStrychnine is so powerfully bitter, that one part dissolved in 70,000 of\r\nwater is distinctly perceptible; it is a strong base, with a marked\r\nalkaline reaction, neutralising the strongest acids fully, and\r\nprecipitating many metallic oxides from their combinations, often with\r\nthe formation of double salts. Most of the salts of strychnine are\r\ncrystalline, and all extremely bitter. Strychnine, in the presence of\r\noxygen, combines with SH₂ to form a beautiful crystalline compound:--\r\n\r\n  2C₂₁H₂₂N₂O₂ + 6H₂S + O₃ = 2C₂₁H₂₂N₂O₂3H₂S₂ + 3H₂O.\r\n\r\nOn treatment with an acid this compound yields H₂S₂.--Schmidt, _Ber.\r\nDeutsch. Chem. Ges._, 8, 1267.\r\n\r\nAn alcoholic solution of strychnine turns the plane of polarisation to\r\nthe left, [α]_r_ = -132·08° to 136·78° (_Bouchardat_); but acid\r\nsolutions show a much smaller rotatory power.\r\n\r\nThe salts used in medicine are--the _sulphate_, officinal only in the\r\nFrench pharmacopœia; the _nitrate_, officinal in the German, Austrian,\r\nSwiss, Norse, and Dutch pharmacopœias; and the _acetate_, well known in\r\ncommerce, but not officinal.\r\n\r\nThe commercial =Sulphate= (C₂₁H₂₂N₂O₂H₂SO₄ + 2H₂O) is an acid salt\r\ncrystallising in needles which lose water at 150°, the neutral sulphate\r\n(2C₂₁H₂₂N₂O₂,H₂SO₄ + 7H₂O) crystallises in four-sided, orthorhombic\r\nprisms, and is soluble in about 50 parts of cold water.\r\n\r\nThe =Nitrate= (C₂₁H₂₂N₂O₂,HNO₃) crystallises on evaporation from a warm\r\nsolution of the alkaloid in dilute nitric acid, in silky needles, mostly\r\ncollected in groups. The solubility of this salt is considerable, one\r\npart dissolving in 50 of cold, in 2 of boiling water; its solubility in\r\nboiling and cold alcohol is almost the same, taking 60 of the former and\r\n2 of the latter.\r\n\r\nThe =Acetate= crystallises in tufts of needles; as stated, it is not\r\nofficinal in any of the European pharmacopœias.\r\n\r\nThe chief precipitates or sparingly soluble crystalline compounds of\r\nstrychnine are--\r\n\r\n(1.) =The Chromate of Strychnine= (C₂₁H₂₂N₂O₂CrHO₂), formed by adding a\r\nneutral solution of chromate of potash to a solution of a strychnine\r\nsalt, crystallises out of hot water in beautiful, very insoluble,\r\norange-yellow needles, mixed with plates of various size and thickness.\r\nThe salt is of great practical use to the analyst; for by its aid\r\nstrychnine may be separated from a variety of substances, and in part\r\nfrom brucine--the colour tests being either applied direct to the\r\nstrychnine chromate, or the chromate decomposed by ammonia, and the\r\nstrychnine recovered from the alkaline liquid by chloroform.\r\n\r\n(2.) =Sulphocyanide of Strychnine= (C₂₁H₂₂N₂O₂CNHS) is a thick, white\r\nprecipitate, produced by the addition of a solution of potassic\r\nsulphocyanide to that of a strychnine salt; on warming it dissolves, but\r\non cooling reappears in the form of long silky needles.\r\n\r\n(3.) =Double Salts.=--The platinum compound obtained by adding a\r\nsolution of platinic chloride to one of strychnine chloride has the\r\ncomposition C₂₁H₂₂N₂O₂HClPtCl₂, and crystallises out of weak boiling\r\nalcohol (in which it is somewhat soluble) in gold-like scales. The\r\nsimilar palladium compound (C₂₁H₂₂N₂O₂HCl,PdCl) is in dark brown\r\nneedles, and the gold compound (C₂₁H₂₂N₂O₂HClAuCl₃) in orange-coloured\r\nneedles.\r\n\r\n(4.) =Strychnine Trichloride.=--The action of chlorine on strychnine--by\r\nwhich chlorine is substituted for a portion of the hydrogen--has been\r\nproposed as a test. The alkaloid is dissolved in very dilute HCl, so as\r\nto be only just acid; on now passing through chlorine gas, a white\r\ninsoluble precipitate is formed, which may be recrystallised from ether;\r\nit has probably the composition C₂₁H₁₉Cl₃N₂O₂, and is extremely\r\ninsoluble in water.\r\n\r\n(5.) =The Iodide of Strychnine= (C₂₁H₂₂N₂O₂HI₃) is obtained by the\r\naction of iodine solution on strychnine sulphate; on solution of the\r\nprecipitate in alcohol, and evaporation, it forms violet-coloured\r\ncrystals, very similar to those of potassic permanganate.\r\n\r\n§ 388. =Pharmaceutical and other Preparations of Nux Vomica and\r\nStrychnine, with Suggestions for their Valuation.=\r\n\r\n=An aqueous extract of nux vomica=, officinal in the German\r\npharmacopœia, appears to contain principally brucine, with a small\r\npercentage of strychnine; the proportion of brucine to strychnine being\r\nabout four-fifths to one-fifth. Blossfield found in a sample 4·3 per\r\ncent. of total alkaloid, and two samples examined by Grundmann consisted\r\n(No. 1) of strychnine, 0·6 per cent.; brucine, 2·58 per cent.--total,\r\n3·18 per cent.; (No. 2) strychnine, 0·68 per cent.; brucine, 2·62 per\r\ncent.--total, 3·3 per cent. A sample examined by Dragendorff\r\nyielded--strychnine, 0·8 per cent.; brucine, 3·2 per cent.--total, 4 per\r\ncent. The maximum medicinal dose is put at ·6 grm. (9⁹⁄₁₄ grains).\r\n\r\n=The spirituous extract of nux vomica=, officinal in the British and all\r\nthe Continental pharmacopœias, differs from the aqueous in containing a\r\nmuch larger proportion of alkaloids, viz., about 15 per cent., and about\r\nhalf the total quantity being strychnine. The medicinal dose is\r\n21·6-64·8 mgrms. (⅓ grain to a grain).\r\n\r\nThere is also an =extract of St. Ignatius bean= which is used in the\r\nUnited States; nearly the whole of its alkaloid may be referred to\r\nstrychnine.\r\n\r\n=The tincture of nux vomica=, made according to the British\r\nPharmacopœia, contains in 1 fl. oz. 1 grain of alkaloids, or 0·21 part\r\nby weight in 100 by volume, but the strength of commercial samples often\r\nvaries. Lieth found in one sample 0·122 per cent. of strychnine and 0·09\r\nper cent. brucine; and two samples examined by Wissel consisted\r\nrespectively of 0·353 per cent. and 0·346 per cent. of total alkaloids.\r\nDragendorff found in two samples ·2624 per cent. and ·244 per cent. of\r\ntotal alkaloids, about half of which was strychnine.\r\n\r\n=Analysis.=--Either of the extracts may be treated for a few hours on\r\nthe water-bath, with water acidulated by sulphuric acid, filtered, the\r\nresidue well washed, the acid liquid shaken up with benzene to separate\r\nimpurities, and, on removal of the benzene, alkalised with ammonia, and\r\nshaken up two or three times with chloroform; the chloroform is then\r\nevaporated in a tared vessel, and the total alkaloids weighed. The\r\nalkaloids can then be either (_a_) treated with 11 per cent. of nitric\r\nacid on the water-bath until all the brucine is destroyed, and then (the\r\nliquid being neutralised) precipitated by potassic chromate; or (_b_)\r\nthe alkaloids may be converted into picrates. Picrate of strychnine is\r\nvery insoluble in water, 1 part requiring no less than 10,000 of\r\nwater.[423] The tincture is analysed on precisely similar principles,\r\nthe spirit being got rid of by distillation, and the residue treated by\r\nacidified water, &c.\r\n\r\n[423] Dolzler, _Arch. Pharm._ [3], xxiv. 105-109.\r\n\r\nThe nux vomica powder itself may be valued as follows:--15 to 20 grms.,\r\npulverised as finely as possible, are treated three times with 150 to\r\n300 c.c. of water, acidified with sulphuric acid, well boiled, and,\r\nafter each boiling, filtered and thoroughly pressed. The last exhaustion\r\nmust be destitute of all bitter taste. The united filtrates are then\r\nevaporated to the consistence of a thick syrup, which is treated with\r\nsufficient burnt magnesia to neutralise the acid. The extract is now\r\nthoroughly exhausted with boiling alcohol of 90 per cent.; the alcoholic\r\nextract, in its turn, is evaporated nearly to dryness, and treated with\r\nacidulated water; this acid solution is freed from impurities by shaking\r\nup with benzene, and lastly alkalised with ammonia, and the alkaloids\r\nextracted by shaking up with successive portions of chloroform. The\r\nchloroformic extract equals the total alkaloids, which may be separated\r\nin the usual way.\r\n\r\nIn four samples of nux vomica examined by Dragendorff, the total\r\nalkaloids ranged from 2·33 to 2·42 per cent. Grate found in two samples\r\n2·88 per cent. and 2·86 per cent. respectively; while Karing from one\r\nsample separated only 1·65 per cent. The strychnine and brucine are in\r\nabout equal proportions, Dragendorff[424] finding 1·187 per cent.\r\nstrychnine and 1·145 per cent. brucine.[425]\r\n\r\n[424] Dragendorff, _Die chemische Werthbestimmung einiger starkwirkenden\r\nDroguen_, St. Petersburg, 1874.\r\n\r\n[425] These details are very necessary, as bearing on the question of\r\nthe fatal dose of nux vomica, which Taylor tells us (_Med. Jurisprud._,\r\ni. 409) was of some importance in _Reg._ v. _Wren_, in which 47 grains\r\nwere attempted to be given in milk. The fatal dose of nux vomica must be\r\nruled by its alkaloidal content, which may be so low as 1 per cent., and\r\nas high as nearly 3 per cent. 30 grains have proved fatal (_Taylor_); if\r\nthe powder in this instance was of the ordinary strength, the person\r\ndied from less than a grain (·0648 grm.) of the united alkaloids.\r\n\r\nThe =vermin-killers= in use in this country are those of Miller, Battle,\r\nButler, Clift, Craven, Floyd, Gibson, Hunter, Stenier, and Thurston. Ten\r\nsamples from these various makers were examined recently by Mr. Allen\r\n(_Pharm.

Out of these deaths, 118 were ascribed to\r\n“vermin-killer.” “Vermin-killer” may be presumed to include not only\r\nstrychnine mixtures, but also phosphorus and arsenic pastes and powders,\r\nso that there are no means of ascertaining the number of strychnine\r\ncases comprised under this heading. Taking the deaths actually\r\nregistered as due to strychnine or nux vomica, they are about 4·7 per\r\ncent. of the deaths from all sorts of poison. Of these deaths, 268, or\r\n82·4 per cent., were suicidal, 8 were homicidal, and 49 only were\r\naccidental.\r\n\r\nSchauenstein has collected from literature 130 cases of poisoning by\r\nstrychnine, but most of these occurred during the last twenty-five\r\nyears; 62 of the 130, or about one-half, were fatal, and 15 were\r\nhomicidal. It has been stated that strychnine is so very unsuitable for\r\nthe purpose of criminal poisoning as to render it unlikely to be often\r\nused. Facts, however, do not bear out this view; for, allowing its\r\nintensely bitter taste, yet it must be remembered that bitter liquids,\r\nsuch as bitter ale, are in daily use, and a person accustomed to drink\r\nany liquid rapidly might readily imbibe sufficient of a toxic liquid to\r\nproduce death before he was warned by its bitterness. It is, indeed,\r\ncapable of demonstration, that taste is more vivid _after_ a substance\r\nhas been taken than just in the act of swallowing, for the function of\r\ntaste is not a rapid process, and requires a very appreciable interval\r\nof time.\r\n\r\nThe series of murders by Thomas Neill, or, more correctly, Thomas Neill\r\nCream, is an example of the use of strychnine for the purposes of\r\nmurder. Thomas Neill Cream was convicted, October 21, 1892, for the\r\nmurder of Matilda Clover on October 20, 1891; there was also good\r\nevidence that the same criminal had murdered Ellen Dunworth, October 13,\r\n1891; Alice Marsh, April 12, 1892; Emma Shrivell, April 12, 1892, and\r\nhad attempted the life of Louie Harvey. The agent in all these cases was\r\nstrychnine. There was no evidence as to what form of the poison was\r\nadministered in the case of Clover, but Ellen Dunworth, who was found\r\ndying in the streets at 7.45 P.M., and died less than two hours\r\nafterwards, stated that a gentleman gave her “two drops” of white stuff\r\nto drink.\r\n\r\nIn the cases of Marsh and Shrivell, Neill Cream had tea with them on the\r\nnight of April 11, and gave them both “three long pills;” half an hour\r\nafter Neill Cream left them they were found to be dying, and died within\r\nsix hours. From Marsh 7 grains, from Shrivell nearly 2 grains of\r\nstrychnine were separated; the probability is that each pill contained\r\nat least 3 grains of strychnine. The criminal met Louie Harvey on the\r\nEmbankment, and gave her “some pills” to take; she pretended to do so,\r\nbut threw them away. Hence it seems probable that Neill Cream took\r\nadvantage of the weakness that a large number of the population have for\r\ntaking pills, and mostly poisoned his victims in this manner. Clover’s\r\ncase was not diagnosed during life, but strychnine was found six or\r\nseven months after burial in the body. It may be mentioned incidentally\r\nthat the accused himself furnished the clue which led to his arrest, by\r\nwriting letters charging certain members of the medical profession with\r\npoisoning these poor young prostitutes with strychnine.\r\n\r\n§ 390. =Fatal Dose.=--In a research, which may, from its painstaking\r\naccuracy, be called classical, F. A. Falck has thrown much light upon\r\nthe minimum lethal dose of strychnine for various animals. It would seem\r\nthat, in relation to its size, the frog is by no means so sensible to\r\nstrychnine as was believed, and that animals such as cats and rabbits\r\ntake a smaller dose in proportion to their body-weight. The method used\r\nby Falck was to inject subcutaneously a solution of known strength of\r\nstrychnine nitrate, and, beginning at first with a known lethal dose, a\r\nsecond experiment was then made with a smaller dose, and if that proved\r\nfatal, with a still smaller, and so on, until such a quantity was\r\narrived at, that the chances as determined by direct observation were as\r\ngreat of recovery as of death. Operating in this way, and making no less\r\nthan 20 experiments on the rabbit, he found that the least fatal dose\r\nfor that animal was ·6 mgrm. of strychnine nitrate per kilogramme. Cats\r\nwere a little less susceptible, taking ·75 mgrm. Operating on fowls, he\r\nfound that strychnine taken into the crop in the usual way was very\r\nuncertain; 50 mgrms. per kilo, taken with the food had no effect, but\r\nresults always followed if the poison was introduced into the\r\ncirculation by the subcutaneous needle--the lethal dose for fowls being,\r\nunder those circumstances, 1 to 2 mgrms. per kilo. He made 35\r\nexperiments on frogs, and found that to kill a frog by strychnine\r\nnitrate, at least 2 mgrms. per kilo, must be injected. Mice take a\r\nlittle more, from 2·3 to 2·4 mgrms. per kilo. In 2 experiments on the\r\nring adder, in one 62·5 mgrms. per kilo. of strychnine nitrate, injected\r\nsubcutaneously, caused death in seven hours; in the second, 23·1 mgrms.\r\nper kilo. caused death in five days; hence the last quantity is probably\r\nabout the least fatal dose for this particular snake.\r\n\r\nThese observations may be conveniently thrown into the following table\r\n(see next page), placing the animals in order according to their\r\nrelative sensitiveness.[426]\r\n\r\n[426] According to Christison’s researches, 0·2 grm. (about ⅓ grain) is\r\nfatal to swine; ·03 grm. (½ grain) to bears, if injected into the\r\npleura. 1 to 3 grains (·0648 to ·1944 grm.) is given to horses in cases\r\nof paralysis, although 3 grains cannot but be considered a dangerous\r\ndose, unless smaller doses have been previously administered without\r\neffect; 10 grains would probably kill a horse, and 15 grains (·972 grm.)\r\nhave certainly done so.\r\n\r\nNow, the important question arises, as to the place in this series\r\noccupied by man--a question difficult to solve, because so few cases are\r\nrecorded in which strychnine has been administered by subcutaneous\r\ninjection with fatal result. Eulenberg has observed poisonous symptoms,\r\nbut not death, produced by 6 mgrms. (1/11 grain) and by 10 mgrms. (about\r\n⅙ grain). Bois observed poisonous symptoms from the similar subcutaneous\r\nadministrations of 8 mgrms. to a child six years old, and 4 mgrms. to\r\nanother child four years old--the latter dose, in a case recorded by\r\nChristison, actually killing a child of three years of age. On the other\r\nhand, the smallest lethal dose taken by an adult was swallowed in\r\nsolution. Dr. Warner took 32 mgrms. (½ grain) of strychnine sulphate,\r\nmistaking it for morphine sulphate, and died in twenty minutes. In other\r\ncases 48 mgrms. (7/10 grain) have been fatal. It will be safe to\r\nconclude that these doses by the stomach would have acted still more\r\nsurely and energetically if injected subcutaneously. The case of Warner\r\nis exceptional, for he was in weak health; and, if calculated out\r\naccording to body-weight, presuming that Dr. Warner weighed 68 kilos.,\r\nthe relative dose as strychnine nitrate would be ·24 per kilo.--a\r\nsmaller dose than for any animal hitherto experimented upon. There is,\r\nhowever, far more reason for believing that the degree of sensitiveness\r\nin man is about the same as that of cats or dogs, and that the least\r\nfatal dose for man is ·70 per kilo., the facts on record fairly bearing\r\nout this view. It is, therefore, probable that death would follow if 38\r\nmgrms. (7/10 grain) were injected subcutaneously into a man of the\r\naverage weight of 68 kilos. (150 lbs.). Taylor estimates the fatal dose\r\nof strychnine for adults as from 32·4 to 129·6 mgrms. (·5 to 2 grains);\r\nGuy puts the minimum at 16·2 mgrms. (·25 grain).\r\n\r\nTABLE SHOWING THE ACTION OF STRYCHNINE ON ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n  +------------+----------------------+--------------------------------+\r\n  |            |                      |     Reckoned on 1 Kilo. of     |\r\n  |            |                      |            Body-weight.        |\r\n  |            |                      +-----------------|--------------+\r\n  |            |      Manner of       |      Lowest     |  Highest     |\r\n  |  Animal.   |     Application.     |    Experimental | Experimental |\r\n  |            |                      |    Lethal Dose  | Lethal Dose. |\r\n  |            |                      +-----------------+--------------+\r\n  |            |                      | Dose of Strychnine Nitrate in  |\r\n  |            |                      |              Mgrms.            |\r\n  +------------+----------------------+-----------------+--------------+\r\n  | Rabbit,    | Subcutaneous.        |      0·50       |    0·60      |\r\n  | Cat,       |      „               |       ...       |    0·75      |\r\n  | Dog,       |      „               |       ...       |    0·75      |\r\n  |  „         | Taken by the Stomach.|       2·0       |    3·90      |\r\n  |  „         |      „       Rectum. |       ...       |    2·00      |\r\n  |  „         |      „       Bladder.|      5·50       |     ...      |\r\n  | Fox,       | Subcutaneous.        |       ...       |    1·00      |\r\n  | Hedgehog,  |      „               |      1·00       |    2·00      |\r\n  | Fowl,      |      „               |       ...       |    2·00      |\r\n  | Frog,      |      „               |      2·00       |    2·10      |\r\n  | Mouse,     |      „               |      2·36       |    2·36      |\r\n  | Ring Adder,|      „               |       ...       |   23·10      |\r\n  +------------+----------------------+-----------------+--------------+\r\n\r\nLarge doses of strychnine may be recovered from if correct medical\r\ntreatment is sufficiently prompt. Witness the remarkable instances on\r\nrecord of duplex poisonings, in which the would-be-suicide has\r\nunwittingly defeated his object by taking strychnine simultaneously with\r\nsome narcotic, such as opium or chloral. In a case related by\r\nSchauenstein,[427] a suicidal pharmacist took ·48 grm. or ·6 grm. (7·4\r\nto 9·25 grains) of strychnine nitrate dissolved in about 30 c.c. of\r\nbitter-almond water, and then, after half an hour, since no symptoms\r\nwere experienced, ·6 grm. (9·25 grains) of morphine acetate, which he\r\nlikewise dissolved in bitter-almond water and swallowed. After about ten\r\nminutes, he still could walk with uncertain steps, and poured some\r\nchloroform on the pillow-case of his bed, and lay on his face in order\r\nto breathe it. In a short time he lost consciousness, but again awoke,\r\nand lay in a half-dreamy state, incapable of motion, until some one\r\nentered the room, and hearing him murmur, came to his bedside. At that\r\nmoment--two and a quarter hours after first taking the strychnine--the\r\npharmacist had a fearful convulsion, the breathing was suspended, and he\r\nlost consciousness. Again coming to himself, he had several convulsions,\r\nand a physician who was summoned found him in general tetanus. There\r\nwere first clonic, then tonic convulsions, and finally opisthotonus was\r\nfully developed. The treatment consisted of emetics, and afterwards\r\ntannin and codeine were given separately. The patient slept at short\r\nintervals; in ten hours after the taking of the poison the seizures were\r\nfewer in number and weaker in character, and by the third day recovery\r\nwas complete. Dr. Macredy[428] has also placed on record an interesting\r\ncase, in which the symptoms, from a not very large dose of strychnine,\r\nwere delayed by laudanum for eight hours. A young woman, twenty-three\r\nyears of age, pregnant, took at 10 A.M. a quantity of strychnine\r\nestimated at 1·5 grain, in the form of Battle’s vermin-killer, and\r\nimmediately afterwards 2 ounces of laudanum. She was seen by Dr. Macredy\r\nin four hours, and was then suffering from pronounced narcotic symptoms.\r\nA sulphate of zinc emetic was administered. In eight hours after taking\r\nthe strychnine, there were first observed some clonic convulsive\r\nmovements of the hands, and, in a less degree, the legs. These\r\nconvulsions continued, at times severe, for several hours, and were\r\ntreated with chloral. Recovery was speedy and complete.\r\n\r\n[427] Maschka’s _Handbuch_, from Tschepke, _Deutsche Klinik_, 1861.\r\n\r\n[428] _Lancet_, November 28, 1882.\r\n\r\nIn a similar case related by Dr. Harrison,[429] a man, aged 54, took a\r\npacket of Battle’s vermin-killer, mixed with about a drachm and a half\r\nof laudanum and some rum. At the time he had eaten no food for days, and\r\nhad been drinking freely; yet fifty minutes elapsed before the usual\r\nsymptoms set in, and no medical treatment was obtained until four hours\r\nafter taking the dose. He was then given chloral and other remedies, and\r\nmade a rapid recovery.\r\n\r\n[429] _Lancet_, May 13, 1882.\r\n\r\n§ 391. =Action on Animals.=--The action of strychnine has been\r\nexperimentally studied on all classes of animals, from the infusoria\r\nupwards. The effects produced on animal forms which possess a nervous\r\nsystem are strikingly alike, and even in the cephalopoda, tetanic\r\nmuscular spasm may be readily observed. Of all animals the frog shows\r\nthe action of strychnine in its purest form, especially if a dose be\r\ngiven of just sufficient magnitude to produce toxic effects. The frog\r\nsits perfectly still and quiet, unless acted upon by some external\r\nstimuli, such as a breath of air, a loud noise, or the shaking of the\r\nvessel which contains it, then an immediate tetanic convulsion of all\r\nthe muscles is witnessed, lasting a few seconds only, when the animal\r\nagain resumes its former posture. This heightened state of reflex action\r\nhas its analogue in hydrophobia as well as in idiopathic tetanus. If the\r\nfrog thus poisoned by a weak dose is put under a glass shade, kept\r\nmoist, and sheltered from sound, or from other sources of irritation, no\r\nconvulsions occur, and after some days it is in its usual health. If, on\r\nthe other hand, by frequent stimuli, convulsions are excited, the animal\r\ndies. M. Richet[430] has contributed a valuable memoir to the Academy of\r\nSciences on the toxic action of strychnine. He has confirmed the\r\nstatement of previous observers that, with artificial respiration, much\r\nlarger doses of strychnine may be taken without fatal result than under\r\nnormal conditions, and has also recorded some peculiar phenomena.\r\nOperating on dogs and rabbits, after first securing a canula in the\r\ntrachea, and then injecting beneath the skin or into the saphena vein 10\r\nmgrms. of strychnine hydrochlorate, the animal is immediately, or within\r\na few seconds, seized with tetanic convulsions, and this attack would be\r\nmortal, were it not for artificial respiration. Directly this is\r\npractised the attack ceases, and the heart, after a period of hurried\r\nand spasmodic beats, takes again its regular rhythm. Stronger and\r\nstronger doses may then be injected without causing death. As the dose\r\nis thus augmented, the symptoms differ. M. Richet distinguishes the\r\nfollowing periods:--(1.) A period of tetanus. (2.) A period of\r\nconvulsion, characterised by spasmodic and incessant contraction of all\r\nthe muscles. (3.) A little later, when the quantity exceeds 10 mgrms.\r\nper kilo., a choreic period, which is characterised by violent rhythmic\r\nshocks, very sudden and short, repeated at intervals of about three to\r\nfour seconds; during these intervals there is almost complete\r\nrelaxation. (4.) A period of relaxation; this period is attained when\r\nthe dose exceeds 40 mgrms. per kilo. Reflex action is annihilated, the\r\nspontaneous respiratory movements cease, the heart beats tumultuously\r\nand regularly in the severe tetanic convulsions at first, and then\r\ncontracts with frequency but with regularity. The pupils, widely dilated\r\nat first, become much contracted. The arterial pressure, enormously\r\nraised at the commencement, diminishes gradually, in one case from 0·34\r\nmm. to 0·05 mm. The temperature undergoes analogous changes, and during\r\nthe convulsions is extraordinarily elevated; it may even attain 41° or\r\n42°, to sink in the period of relaxation to 36°. Dogs and rabbits which\r\nhave thus received enormous quantities of strychnine (_e.g._, 50 mgrms.\r\nper kilo.), may, in this way, live for several hours, but the slightest\r\ninterruption to the artificial respiration, in the relaxed state, is\r\nfollowed by syncope and death.\r\n\r\n[430] _De l’Action de la Strychnine à très forte dose sur les\r\nMammifères. Comptes Rend._, t. xcl. p. 131.\r\n\r\n§ 392. =Effects on Man: Symptoms.=--The commencement of symptoms may be\r\nextremely rapid, the rapidity being mainly dependent on the form of the\r\npoison and the manner of application. A soluble salt of strychnine\r\ninjected subcutaneously will act within a few seconds;[431] in a case of\r\namaurosis, related by Schuler,[432] 5·4 mgrms. of a soluble strychnine\r\nsalt were introduced into the punctum lachrymale;--in less than four\r\nminutes there were violent tetanic convulsions. In a case related by\r\nBarker, the symptoms commenced in three minutes from a dose of ·37 grm.\r\n(5·71 grains).[433] Here the poison was not administered subcutaneously.\r\nSuch short periods, to a witness whose mind was occupied during the\r\ntime, might seem immediate. On the other hand, when nux vomica powder\r\nhas been taken, and when strychnine has been given in the form of pill,\r\nno such rapid course has been observed, or is likely to occur, the usual\r\ncourse being for the symptoms to commence within half an hour. It is,\r\nhowever, also possible for them to be delayed from one to two hours, and\r\nunder certain circumstances (as in the case related by Macredy) for\r\neight hours. In a few cases, there is first a feeling of uneasiness and\r\nheightened sensibility to external stimuli, a strange feeling in the\r\nmuscles of the jaw, and a catching of the respiration; but generally\r\nthe onset of the symptoms is as sudden as epilepsy, and previous to\r\ntheir appearance the person may be pursuing his ordinary vocation, when,\r\nwithout preliminary warning, there is a shuddering of the whole frame,\r\nand a convulsive seizure. The convulsions take the form of violent\r\ngeneral tetanus; the limbs are stretched out involuntarily, the hands\r\nare clenched, the soles of the feet incurved, and, in the height of the\r\nparoxysm, the back may be arched and rigid as a board, the sufferer\r\nresting on head and heels, and the abdomen tense. In the grasp of the\r\nthoracic muscles the walls of the chest are set immovable, and from the\r\nimpending suffocation the face becomes congested, the eyes prominent and\r\nstaring. The muscles of the lower jaw--in “disease tetanus” the first to\r\nbe affected--are in “strychnos tetanus,” as a rule, the last; a\r\ndistinction, if it were more constant, of great clinical value. The\r\nconvulsions and remissions recur until death or recovery, and, as a\r\nrule, within two hours from the commencement of the symptoms the case in\r\nsome way or other terminates. The number of the tetanic seizures noted\r\nhas varied--in a few cases the third spasm has passed into death, in\r\nothers there have been a great number. The duration of the spasm is also\r\nvery different, and varies from thirty seconds to five or even eight\r\nminutes, the interval between lasting from forty-five seconds[434] to\r\none or even one and a half hours.[435]\r\n\r\n[431] In one of M. Richet’s experiments, a soluble strychnine salt\r\ninjected into a dog subcutaneously acted in fourteen seconds.\r\n\r\n[432] Quoted by Taylor from _Med. Times and Gazette_, July, 1861.\r\n\r\n[433] A non-fatal dose may show its effects rapidly, _e.g._, there is a\r\ncurious case of symptoms of poisoning caused by the _last_ dose of a\r\nmixture which is recorded in _Pharm.

(Richardson’s),          ℥iss.\r\n     Sp. ammon. aromat.,                                ...\r\n     Sp. chloroformi,                              aa. ℥iss.\r\n     Aquam ad,                                         ℥vi.\r\n          ft. mist.\r\n  Shake the bottle.\r\n  Two teaspoonfuls when the attack threatens, and repeat in an hour if\r\n  necessary.\r\n\r\nRichardson’s liquor bismuth contains 1/20 grain of strychnine in each\r\ndrachm. The mixture was alkaline; it contained 1·7 grain of strychnine\r\nand 38·25 minims of chloroform.\r\n\r\nThe patient, a woman, 54 years of age, had taken the previous doses with\r\nconsiderable relief; but ten minutes after the last dose, which she\r\ndescribed as far more bitter than those she had taken previously, she\r\nwas seized with the usual symptoms of strychnine poisoning, but\r\nrecovered after five hours.\r\n\r\nThe explanation is pretty obvious; the mixture was alkaline, so that the\r\nstrychnine was not in the form of a salt, but in the free state, and was\r\ntherefore dissolved by the chloroform; the amount of strychnine taken in\r\neach dose wholly depended on whether or not the mixture was shaken\r\nviolently and poured out into the teaspoon immediately after shaking; if\r\nallowed to repose the globules of chloroform saturated with strychnine\r\nwould settle at the bottom, and there form a stratum rich in strychnine;\r\nso that the last dose would certainly contain an excess.\r\n\r\n[434] White, _Brit. Med. Journ._, 1867.\r\n\r\n[435] Folkes, _Med. Times_, 1869.\r\n\r\n§ 393. =Diagnosis of Strychnine Poisoning.=--However striking and well\r\ndefined the picture of strychnine tetanus may be, mistakes in diagnosis\r\nare rather frequent, especially when a medical man is hastily summoned,\r\nhas never seen a case of similar poisoning, and has no suspicion of the\r\npossible nature of the seizure. If a young woman, for instance, is the\r\nsubject, he may put it down to hysteria, and certainly hysteria not\r\nunfrequently affects somewhat similar convulsions. In a painful case in\r\nwhich the author was engaged, a young woman either took or was given\r\n(for the mystery was never cleared up fully) a fatal dose of strychnine,\r\nand though the symptoms were well marked, the medical attendant was so\r\npossessed with the view that the case was due to hysteria, that, even\r\nafter making the _post-mortem_ examination, and finding no adequate\r\nlesion, he theorised as to the possibility of some fatal hysteric spasm\r\nof the glottis, while there was ample chemical evidence of strychnine,\r\nand a weighable quantity of the alkaloid was actually separated from the\r\ncontents of the stomach. The medical attendant of Matilda Clover, one of\r\nNeill’s victims, certified that the girl died from _delirium tremens_\r\nand syncope, although the symptoms were typically those produced by\r\nstrychnine. Such cases are particularly sad, for we now know that, with\r\njudicious treatment, a rather large dose may be recovered from.\r\n\r\nIf the case is a male, a confusion with epilepsy is possible, though\r\nhardly to be explained or excused; while in both sexes idiopathic\r\ntetanus is so extremely similar as to give rise to the idea that all\r\ncases of idiopathic tetanus are produced by poison, perhaps secreted by\r\nthe body itself. As for the distinction between idiopathic and strychnic\r\ntetanus, it is usually laid down (1) that the intervals in the former\r\nare characterised by no relaxation of the muscles, but that they\r\ncontinue contracted and hard; and (2) that there is a notable rise of\r\ntemperature in disease tetanus proper, and not in strychnine tetanus.\r\nBoth statements are misleading, and the latter is not true, for in\r\nstrychnic poisoning the relaxation is not constant, and very high\r\ntemperatures in animals have been observed.\r\n\r\n§ 394. =Physiological Action.=--The tetanic convulsions are essentially\r\nreflex, and to be ascribed to a central origin; the normal reflex\r\nsensibility is exaggerated and unnaturally extended. If the ischiatic\r\nplexus supplying the one leg of an animal is cut through, that leg takes\r\nno part in the general convulsions, but if the artery of the leg alone\r\nis tied, then the leg suffers from the muscular spasm, as well as the\r\nlimbs in which the circulation is unrestrained. In an experiment by Sir\r\nB. W. Richardson, a healthy dog was killed, and, as soon as practicable,\r\na solution of strychnine was injected through the systemic vessels by\r\nthe aorta--the whole body became at once stiff and rigid as a board.\r\nThese facts point unmistakably to the spinal marrow as the seat of the\r\ntoxic influence. Strychnine is, _par excellence_, a spinal poison. On\r\nphysiological grounds the grey substance of the cord is considered to\r\nhave an inhibitory action upon reflex sensibility, and this inhibitory\r\npower is paralysed by strychnine. The spinal cord, it would appear, has\r\nthe power of collecting strychnine from the circulation and storing it\r\nup in its structure.[436]\r\n\r\n[436] R. W. Lovett, _Journ. Physiol._, ix. 99-111.\r\n\r\nMuch light has been thrown upon the cause of death by Richet’s\r\nexperiments.[437] It would seem that, in some cases, death takes place\r\nby a suffocation as complete as in drowning, the chest and diaphragm\r\nbeing immovable, and the nervous respiratory centres exhausted. In such\r\na case, immediate death would be averted by a tracheal tube, by the aid\r\nof which artificial respiration might be carried on; but there is\r\nanother asphyxia due to the enormous interstitial combustion carried on\r\nby muscles violently tetanised. “If,” says Richet, “after having\r\ninjected into a dog a mortal dose of strychnine, and employed artificial\r\nrespiration according to the classic method twenty or thirty times a\r\nminute, the animal dies (sometimes at the end of ten minutes, and in\r\nevery case at the end of an hour or two), and during life the arterial\r\nblood is examined, it will be ascertained that it is black, absolutely\r\nlike venous blood.”\r\n\r\n[437] _Op. cit._\r\n\r\nThis view is also supported by the considerable rise of temperature\r\nnoticed: the blood is excessively poor in oxygen, and loaded with carbon\r\ndioxide. That this state of the blood is produced by tetanus, is proved\r\nby the fact that an animal poisoned by strychnine, and then injected\r\nsubcutaneously with curare in quantity just sufficient to paralyse the\r\nmuscular system, does not exhibit these phenomena. By the aid of\r\nartificial respiration, together with the administration of curare, an\r\nanimal may live after a prodigious dose of strychnine.\r\n\r\nMeyer[438] has investigated carefully the action of strychnine on the\r\nblood-pressure--through a strong excitement of the vaso-motor centre,\r\nthe arteries are narrowed in calibre, and the blood-pressure much\r\nincreased; the action of the heart in frogs is slowed, but in the\r\nwarm-blooded animals quickened.\r\n\r\n[438] _Wiener Akad. Sitzungsber._, 1871.\r\n\r\n§ 395. =Post-mortem Appearances.=--There is but little characteristic in\r\nthe _post-mortem_ appearances from strychnine poisoning. The body\r\nbecomes very stiff a short time after death, and this rigidity remains\r\ngenerally a long time. In the notorious Palmer case, the body was rigid\r\ntwo months after death, but, on the other hand, the _rigor mortis_ has\r\nbeen known to disappear within twenty-four hours. If the convulsions\r\nhave been violent, there may be minute hæmorrhages in the brain and\r\nother parts. I have seen considerable hæmorrhage in the trachea from\r\nthis cause. When death occurs from asphyxia, the ordinary signs of\r\nasphyxia will be found in the lungs, &c. The heart mostly has its right\r\nside gorged with blood, but in a few cases it is empty and contracted.\r\n\r\nIn a case which Schauenstein has recorded[439] he found strychnine still\r\nundissolved, coating the stomach as a white powder; but this is very\r\nunusual, and I believe unique. The bladder often contains urine, which,\r\nit need scarcely be said, should be preserved for chemical\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\n[439] _Op. cit._\r\n\r\n§ 396. =Treatment.=--From the cases detailed, and from the experiments\r\non animals, the direction which treatment should take is very clear. As\r\na matter of course, if there is the slightest probability of any of the\r\npoison remaining in the stomach, it should be removed. It is doubtful\r\nwhether the stomach pump can be ever applied with benefit in strychnine\r\npoisoning, the introduction of the tube is likely to aggravate the\r\ntetanus, but apomorphine can be injected subcutaneously. Large and\r\nfrequent doses of chloral should be administered in order to lessen the\r\nfrequency of convulsions, or prevent their occurrence, and it may be\r\nnecessary in a few cases, where death threatens by suffocation, to\r\nperform tracheotomy, and to use artificial respiration. Where chloral or\r\nchloroform is not at hand, and in cases of emergency, where this may\r\neasily happen, the medical man must administer in full doses the nearest\r\nnarcotic at hand.[440]\r\n\r\n[440] It is certain that lutidine would be a valuable antidote for\r\nstrychnine. C. G. Williams found that lutidine injected into frogs\r\nalready under the influence of strychnine, arrested the convulsions, or\r\nif given first, and then followed by a fatal dose of strychnine, it\r\nprevented the appearance of the tetanus. (See _ante_, p. 276, footnote.)\r\n\r\n§ 397. =Separation of Strychnine from Organic Matters.=--The separation\r\nof strychnine from organic matters, &c., is undertaken strictly on the\r\ngeneral principles already detailed. It may happen, however, that in\r\ncases of poisoning there is the strongest evidence from symptoms in the\r\nperson or animal that strychnine alone is to be sought for. In an\r\ninstance of the kind, if a complex organic liquid (such as the contents\r\nof the stomach) is under examination, it is best to remove the solid\r\nsubstances by filtration through glass, wool, or linen, and evaporate\r\nnearly to dryness over the water-bath, acidifying with acetic acid, and\r\nthen exhausting the residue repeatedly with boiling alcohol of 80 per\r\ncent. The alcoholic extract is in its turn evaporated to dryness, and\r\ntaken up with water; the aqueous solution is passed through a wet\r\nfilter, and then shaken up with the usual succession of fluids, viz.,\r\npetroleum ether, benzene, chloroform, and amyl alcohol, which will\r\nremove a great number of impurities, but will not dissolve the\r\nstrychnine from the acid solution. The amyl alcohol may lastly be\r\nremoved by petroleum ether; and on removal of the final extractive\r\n(which should be done as thoroughly as possible) chloroform is added,\r\nand the fluid is alkalised by ammonia, which precipitates the alkaloid\r\nin the presence of the solvent. Should the reverse process be\r\nemployed--that is, ammonia added first, and then chloroform--the\r\nstrychnine is not so perfectly dissolved, since it has time to assume a\r\ncrystalline condition. On separation and evaporation of the chloroform,\r\nthe residue (if much discoloured, or evidently impure) may be dissolved\r\nin alcohol or benzene, and recrystallised several times. Cushman has\r\npublished an improved method of separating strychnine, which, according\r\nto test experiments, appears to give good results. He describes the\r\nmethod as follows:[441]--\r\n\r\n[441] “The _post-mortem_ Detection and Estimation of Strychnine,” by\r\nAllerton S. Cushman--_Chem. News_, vol. lxx. 28.\r\n\r\n    “The stomach contents or viscera properly comminuted are weighed,\r\n    and an aliquot part taken for analysis. The mass is digested in a\r\n    beaker over night, at a warm temperature, with water acidulated with\r\n    acetic acid. The contents of the beaker are filtered by pressing\r\n    through muslin, and then passing through paper. The clear filtrate\r\n    is evaporated on the water-bath to soft dryness, an excess of\r\n    ordinary 80 per cent. alcohol added, and boiled ten minutes with\r\n    stirring, and allowed to stand one half hour at a warm temperature.\r\n    This extraction is repeated, the alcohol extracts united, filtered,\r\n    evaporated to soft dryness, and the residue taken up with a little\r\n    water acidulated with acetic acid, and shaken out with pure acetic\r\n    ether in a separating funnel. Successive fresh portions of acetic\r\n    ether are used until the solvent shows by its colour, and by the\r\n    evaporation of a few drops, that it does not contain extractive\r\n    matter. As many as twelve extractions are sometimes necessary to\r\n    accomplish this. Care should be taken in each case to allow time for\r\n    as complete separation as possible between the two layers. The\r\n    purified acid aqueous liquid, which need not exceed in bulk 50 c.c.,\r\n    is now returned to the separator, an equal quantity of fresh acetic\r\n    ether added, and enough sodic carbonate in solution to render the\r\n    mixture slightly alkaline, and the separator is then thoroughly\r\n    shaken for several minutes. All the alkaloid should now be in\r\n    solution in the acetic ether, but a second shaking of the alkaline\r\n    liquid, with acetic ether, is always made, the two extracts united,\r\n    and evaporated in a glass dish over hot water to dryness. It will\r\n    now be found that the residue shows the alkaloid fairly pure, but\r\n    not pure enough for quantitative results. The residue is dissolved\r\n    in a few drops of dilute acetic acid, warmed to complete solution,\r\n    filtered if necessary, diluted to about 30 c.c., and the solution\r\n    transferred to a small separating funnel; 30 c.c. of\r\n    ether-chloroform (1-1) are now added, and the separator shaken.\r\n    After separation the heavier ether-chloroform is allowed to run off,\r\n    another lot of 30 c.c. of ether-chloroform is added, the separator\r\n    shaken, and immediately enough ammonia-water added to render the\r\n    mixture alkaline, and the whole vigorously agitated for several\r\n    minutes. After separation is complete, the ether-chloroform layer is\r\n    run out into a clean 50 c.c. glass-stoppered burette. The alkaline\r\n    water solution is agitated with 20 c.c. more of the\r\n    ether-chloroform, separated, and this extract added to that in the\r\n    burette. The burette is now supported over a small weighed glass\r\n    dish, which is kept warm on a water-bath, and the liquid allowed to\r\n    evaporate gently, drop by drop, until a sufficient quantity of the\r\n    pure alkaloid has collected in the centre of the dish to render an\r\n    accurate weighing possible, or else all of the alkaloid may be\r\n    collected and weighed at once. After all possible tests have been\r\n    made upon the weighed alkaloid, the remainder is re-dissolved in a\r\n    drop or two of acetic acid, a little water added, and the dish\r\n    exposed under a bell-glass to the fumes of ammonia. After standing\r\n    some time all the strychnine is found crystallised out in the\r\n    beautiful characteristic needle-formed crystals. The mother-liquor\r\n    is drawn off with a small fine-pointed tube and rubber bulb, the\r\n    crystals carefully washed with a little water and dried over\r\n    sulphuric acid. The glass dish containing these crystals is kept as\r\n    the final exhibit, and is shown in evidence. Another convenient\r\n    exhibit may be prepared by moistening a small filter-paper with a\r\n    solution of the alkaloid in dilute acetic acid, then moistening with\r\n    a solution of potassium dichromate: this paper, on being dried, may\r\n    be kept indefinitely. On moistening it, and touching it at any time\r\n    with a drop of strong sulphuric acid, a violet film, changing to\r\n    cherry-red, is formed at the place of contact.”\r\n\r\nShould search be made for minute portions of strychnine in the tissues,\r\nconsidering the small amount of the poison which may produce death, it\r\nis absolutely necessary to operate on a very large quantity of material.\r\nIt would be advisable to take the whole of the liver, the brain, spinal\r\ncord, spleen, stomach, duodenum, kidneys, all the blood that can be\r\nobtained, and a considerable quantity of muscular tissue, so as to make\r\nin all about one-eighth to one-tenth of the whole body; this may be cut\r\nup into small pieces, and boiled in capacious flasks with alcohol,\r\nacidified with acetic acid. Evaporation must be controlled by adapting\r\nto the cork an upright condenser.\r\n\r\nShould the analyst not have apparatus of a size to undertake this at\r\none operation, it may be done in separate portions--the filtrate from\r\nany single operation being collected in a flask, and the spirit\r\ndistilled off in order to be used for the next. In this way, a large\r\nquantity of the organs and tissues can be exhausted by half a gallon of\r\nalcohol. Finally, most of the alcohol is distilled off, and the\r\nremainder evaporated at a gentle heat in a capacious dish, the final\r\nextract being treated, evaporating to a syrup, and using Cushman’s\r\nprocess (_ante_, p. 334) as just described. It is only by working on\r\nthis large scale that there is any probability of detecting absorbed\r\nstrychnine in those cases where only one or two grains have destroyed\r\nlife, and even then it is possible to miss the poison.\r\n\r\nStrychnine is separated by the kidneys rapidly. In a suicidal case\r\nrecorded by Schauenstein,[442] death took place in an hour and a half\r\nafter taking strychnine, yet from 200 c.c. of the urine, Schauenstein\r\nwas able to separate nitrate of strychnine in well-formed crystals. Dr.\r\nKratter[443] has made some special researches on the times within which\r\nstrychnine is excreted by the kidneys. In two patients, who were being\r\ntreated by subcutaneous injection, half an hour after the injection of\r\n7·5 mgrms. of strychnine nitrate the alkaloid was recognised in the\r\nurine. The strychnine treatment was continued for eight to ten days, and\r\nthen stopped; two days after the cessation, strychnine was found in the\r\nurine, but none on the third day, and the inference drawn is that the\r\nelimination was complete within forty-eight hours.\r\n\r\n[442] Maschka’s _Handbuch_, Band 2, p. 620.\r\n\r\n[443] _Ibid._\r\n\r\nStrychnine has been detected in the blood of dogs and cats in researches\r\nspecially undertaken for that purpose, but sometimes a negative result\r\nhas been obtained, without apparent cause. Dragendorff[444] gave dogs\r\nthe largest possible dose of strychnine daily. On the first few days no\r\nstrychnine was found in the urine, but later it was detected, especially\r\nif food was withheld. M’Adam was the first who detected the absorbed\r\npoison, recognising it in the muscles and urine of a poisoned horse, and\r\nalso in the urine of a hound. Dragendorff has found it in traces in the\r\nkidneys, spleen, and pancreas; Gay, in different parts of the central\r\nnervous system, and in the saliva. So far as the evidence goes, the\r\nliver is the best organ to examine for strychnine; but all parts\r\nsupplied with blood, and most secretions, may contain small quantities\r\nof the alkaloid. At one time it was believed that strychnine might be\r\ndestroyed by putrefaction, but the question of the decomposition of the\r\npoison in putrid bodies may be said to be settled. So far as all\r\nevidence goes, strychnine is an extremely stable substance, and no\r\namount of putrescence will destroy it. M’Adam found it in a horse a\r\nmonth after death, and in a duck eight weeks after; Nunneley in 15\r\nanimals forty-three days after death, when the bodies were much\r\ndecomposed; Roger in a body after five weeks’ interment; Richter in\r\nputrid tissues exposed for eleven years to decomposition in open\r\nvessels; and, lastly, W. A. Noyes[445] in an exhumed body after it had\r\nbeen buried 308 days.\r\n\r\n[444] In an animal rapidly killed by a subcutaneous injection of acetate\r\nof strychnine, no strychnine was detected either in the blood or\r\nliver.--_Dragendorff._\r\n\r\n[445] _Journ. Americ. Chem. Soc._, xvi. 2.\r\n\r\nIt would appear from Ibsen’s[446] experiments that strychnine gets\r\ndissolved in the fluids of the dead body--so that whether strychnine\r\nremains or not, greatly depends as to whether the fluids are retained or\r\nare allowed to soak away; it is, therefore, most important in\r\nexhumations to save as much of the fluid as possible.\r\n\r\n[446] _Viertel. f. gericht. Med._, Bd. viii.\r\n\r\n§ 398. =Identification of the Alkaloid.=--A residue containing\r\nstrychnine, or strychnine mixed with brucine, is identified--\r\n\r\n(1.) By its alkaline reaction and its bitter taste. No substance can\r\npossibly be strychnine unless it tastes remarkably bitter.\r\n\r\n(2.) By the extremely insoluble chromate of strychnine, already\r\ndescribed.[447] A fluid containing 1 : 1000 of strychnine gives with\r\nchromate of potash (if allowed to stand over-night) a marked\r\nprecipitate, dissimilar to all others, except those of lead and baryta\r\nchromates, neither of which can possibly occur if any of the processes\r\ndescribed are followed.\r\n\r\n[447] 1 grm. of strychnine gave 1·280 grms. of the chromate, = 78·1 per\r\ncent. of strychnine; 3 gave 3·811 of the chromate, = 78·77 per cent. of\r\nstrychnine.--_Mohr._\r\n\r\n(3.) If the chromate just described is treated on a porcelain plate with\r\na drop of pure strong sulphuric acid, a deep rich blue colour, passing\r\nthrough purple into red, rapidly makes its appearance. This colour\r\npossesses an absorption spectrum (figured at p. 55). Dr. Guy, neglecting\r\nintermediate colours, aptly compares the succession--(1) to the rich\r\nblue of the Orleans plum; (2) to the darker purple of the mulberry; and\r\n(3) to the bright clear red of the sweet orange. These characters--viz.,\r\nalkalinity, bitterness, and the property of precipitation by potassic\r\nchromate in a definite crystalline form, the crystals giving the\r\ncolours detailed--belong to no other substance known save strychnine,\r\nand for all purposes sufficiently identify the alkaloid. The same\r\ncolour is obtained by mixing a drop of sulphuric acid with\r\nstrychnine and a crystal, or speck, of any one of the following\r\nsubstances:--Ferridcyanide of potash, permanganate of potash, peroxide\r\nof lead, peroxide of manganese, and cerous hydroxide.\r\n\r\nPotassic permanganate and sulphuric acid is the most delicate, and will\r\ndetect 0·001 mgrm. of strychnine; cerous hydroxide is, on the other\r\nhand, most convenient, for cerous hydroxide is white; all the others\r\nhave colours of their own. Cerous hydroxide is prepared strychnine; 3\r\ngave 3·811 of the chromate, = 78·77 per cent. of strychnine.--_Mohr._\r\nby dissolving cerium oxalate in dilute sulphuric acid and precipitating\r\nwith ammonia, filtering and well washing the precipitate; and the latter\r\nmay be used while moist, and responds well to 1/100 mgrm. of strychnine.\r\n\r\nThe influence of mixtures on the colour reactions of strychnine have\r\nbeen studied by Flückiger, who states:--\r\n\r\n“No strychnine reaction appears with sulphuric acid containing chromic\r\nacid (made by dissolving 0·02 grm. of pot. bichromate in 10 c.c. of\r\nwater, and then adding 30 grms. strong sulphuric acid) when brucine and\r\nstrychnine mixed in equal parts are submitted to the test; it succeeds,\r\nhowever, in this proportion with sulphuric acid containing potassium\r\npermanganate (·02 grm. pot. permanganate in 10 c.c. of water, and 30\r\ngrms. of strong sulphuric acid).\r\n\r\n“If the brucine is only one-tenth of the mixture, the blue-violet colour\r\nis obtained. A large excess of atropine does not prevent or obscure the\r\nstrychnine reaction. A solution of 1 milligrm. atropine sulphate\r\nevaporated to dryness, together with 5 c.c. of a solution of strychnine\r\n(1 : 100,000) has no influence on the reaction, neither in the\r\nproportion of 1 mgrm. to 1 c.c. of the same solution; neither has\r\ncinchonine nor quinine any effect.\r\n\r\n“Morphine obscures the reaction in the following proportions:--\r\n\r\n“A solution of 0·01 mgrm. strychnine evaporated with a solution of 1\r\nmgrm. of morphine sulphate on a water-bath, yields a blurred strychnine\r\nreaction when the residue is dissolved in sulphuric acid, and a crystal\r\nof potassic permanganate added. But still there is evidence whereby to\r\n_suspect_ the presence of strychnine.\r\n\r\n“A solution of 2 mgrms. of morphine sulphate treated in like manner with\r\n0·01 mgrm. of strychnine yields like results.\r\n\r\n“A solution of 3 mgrms. of morphine sulphate evaporated to dryness, with\r\na solution of 0·01 mgrm. strychnine yielded results with the potassic\r\npermanganate test the same as if no strychnine was present.\r\n\r\n“A solution of 1 mgrm. of morphine sulphate, treated as above, with a\r\nsolution of 0·1 mgrm. strychnine, offered positive proof of the presence\r\nof the latter.”[448]\r\n\r\n[448] Flückiger’s _Reactions_, translated by Nagelvoort, Detroit, 1893.\r\n\r\nDragendorff was able to render evident ·025 mgrm. mixed with twenty\r\ntimes its weight of quin. sulphate; the same observer likewise\r\nrecognised ·04 mgrm. of strychnine in thirty-three times its weight of\r\ncaffeine. Veratrine is likewise not injurious.\r\n\r\n=The physiological test= consists in administering the substance to some\r\nsmall animal (preferably to a frog), and inducing the ordinary tetanic\r\nsymptoms. It may be at once observed that if definite chemical evidence\r\nof strychnine has been obtained, the physiological test is quite\r\nunnecessary; and, on the other hand, should the application of a liquid\r\nor substance to a frog induce tetanus, while chemical evidence of the\r\npresence of strychnine was wanting, it would be hazardous to assert that\r\nstrychnine was present, seeing that caffeine, carbolic acid, picrotoxin,\r\ncertain of the opium alkaloids, hypaphorine, some of the ptomaines, and\r\nmany other substances induce similar symptoms. The best method (if the\r\ntest is used at all) is to take two frogs,[449] and insert under the\r\nskin of the one the needle of a subcutaneous syringe, previously charged\r\nwith a solution of the substance, injecting a moderate quantity. The\r\nother frog is treated similarly with a very dilute solution of\r\nstrychnine, and the two are then placed under small glass shades, and\r\nthe symptoms observed and compared. It is not absolutely necessary to\r\ninject the solution under the skin, for if applied to the surface the\r\nsame effects are produced; but, if accustomed to manipulation, the\r\noperator will find the subcutaneous application more certain, especially\r\nin dealing with minute quantities of the alkaloid.[450]\r\n\r\n[449] A very practical disadvantage of the physiological test is the\r\ngreat difficulty of obtaining frogs exactly when wanted.\r\n\r\n[450] Methyl strychnine, as well as methyl brucine, has been shown by\r\nBrown and Fraser to have an effect exactly the opposite to that of\r\nstrychnine, paralysing the muscles like curare. In the case, therefore,\r\nof the methyl compounds, a physiological test would be very valuable,\r\nsince these compounds do not respond to the ordinary tests.\r\n\r\n    § 399. =Hypaphorine.=--One substance is known which neither\r\n    physiological test nor the colour reactions suffice to distinguish\r\n    from strychnine, viz., hypaphorine,[451] the active matter of a\r\n    papilionaceous tree growing in Java--the _Hypaphorus subumbrans_; a\r\n    small quantity of the alkaloid is in the bark, a larger quantity is\r\n    in the seed.\r\n\r\n[451] Dr. C. Plugge, _Arch. f. exp. Path. u. Ph._, Bd. xxxii. 313.\r\n\r\n    Hypaphorine forms colourless crystals which brown, without melting,\r\n    above 220°, and exhale a vapour smelling like napththylamine. The\r\n    free alkaloid is soluble in water, but has no action on litmus. The\r\n    salts are less soluble than the free alkaloid, so that acids, such\r\n    as nitric or hydrochloric, produce in a short time precipitates on\r\n    standing. Solutions of the salts are not precipitated by alkalies;\r\n    chloroform, ether, benzene, all fail to extract it from either\r\n    alkaline or acid solutions. It gives no precipitate with potassic\r\n    chromate, but most general alkaloidal reagents precipitate.\r\n\r\n    It gives a precipitate with iodine trichloride, and has therefore\r\n    probably a pyridine nucleus, it may be an acid anilide.[452] It\r\n    gives the same colours as strychnine with sulphuric acid and\r\n    potassic permanganate or potassic chromate; it causes in frogs\r\n    tetanus, but the dose has to be much larger than that of strychnine.\r\n    The duration of life in doses of 15 mgrms. may extend to five days,\r\n    and frogs may even recover after 50 mgrms.\r\n\r\n[452] Julius Tafel (_Ber._, 1890, 412) has shown that the colour\r\nreactions with H₂SO₄ and oxidising agents are the characteristic tests\r\nof an acid anilide.\r\n\r\n    The distinction between strychnine and hypaphorine is therefore\r\n    easy; besides it will not occur in a chloroform extract, and it will\r\n    not give a precipitate with potassic chromate.\r\n\r\n    § 400. =Quantitative Estimation of Strychnine.=--The best process of\r\n    estimating the proportion of each alkaloid in a mixture of\r\n    strychnine and brucine, is to precipitate them as picrates, and to\r\n    destroy the brucine picrate by nitric acid after obtaining the\r\n    combined weight of the mixed picrates; then to weigh the undestroyed\r\n    strychnine picrate.\r\n\r\n    To carry out the process, the solution of the mixed alkaloids must\r\n    be as neutral as possible. A saturated solution of picric acid is\r\n    added drop by drop to complete precipitation. A filter paper is\r\n    dried and weighed, and the precipitate collected on to this filter\r\n    paper; the precipitate is washed with cold water, dried at 105°, and\r\n    weighed. This weight gives the combined weight of both strychnine\r\n    and brucine picrates.\r\n\r\n    The precipitate is now detached from the filter, washed into a small\r\n    flask, and heated on the water-bath for some time with nitric acid\r\n    diluted to 1·056 gravity (about 11 per cent. HNO₃). This process\r\n    destroys the brucine picrate, but leaves the strychnine picrate\r\n    untouched. The acid liquid is now neutralised with ammonia or soda,\r\n    and a trace of acetic acid added; the precipitate of strychnine\r\n    picrate is now collected and weighed. The weight of this subtracted\r\n    from the first weight, of course, gives that of the brucine picrate.\r\n\r\n    One part of strychnine picrate is equal to 0·5932 strychnine; and\r\n    one part of brucine picrate is equal to 0·6324 brucine.\r\n\r\n    From the strychnine picrate the picric acid may be recovered and\r\n    weighed by dissolving the picrate in a mineral acid and shaking out\r\n    with ether; from the acid liquid thus deprived of picric acid the\r\n    alkaloid may be separated by alkalising with ammonia and shaking out\r\n    with chloroform.\r\n\r\n§ 401. =Brucine= (C₂₃H₂₆N₂O₄ + 4H₂O)[453] occurs associated with\r\nstrychnine in the plants already mentioned; its best source is the\r\nso-called _false angustura_ bark, which contains but little strychnine.\r\nIts action is similar to that of strychnine. If crystallised out of\r\ndilute alcohol it contains 4 atoms of water, easily expelled either in a\r\nvacuum over sulphuric acid or by heat. Crystallised thus, it forms\r\ntransparent four-sided prisms, or arborescent forms, like boric acid. If\r\nthrown down by ammonia from a solution of the acetate, it presents\r\nitself in needles or in tufts.\r\n\r\n[453] Sonnenschein has asserted that brucine may be changed into\r\nstrychnine by the action of NO₃. This statement has been investigated by\r\nA. J. Cownley, but not confirmed.--_Pharm. Journ._ (3), vi. p. 841.\r\n\r\nThe recently-crystallised alkaloid has a solubility different from that\r\nwhich has effloresced, the former dissolving in 320 parts of cold, and\r\n150 parts of boiling water; whilst the latter (according to Pelletier\r\nand Caventou) requires 500 of boiling, and 850 parts of cold water for\r\nsolution. Brucine is easily soluble in absolute, as well as in ordinary\r\nalcohol; 1 part dissolves in 1·7 of chloroform, in 60·2 of benzene.\r\nPetroleum ether, the volatile and fatty oils and glycerine, dissolve the\r\nalkaloid slightly, amyl alcohol freely; it is insoluble in _anhydrous_\r\nether. The behaviour of brucine in the subliming cell is described at p.\r\n260. Anhydrous brucine melts in a tube at 178°. The alcoholic solution\r\nof brucine turns the plane of polarisation to the left [α]_r_ = -11·27°.\r\nThe taste is bitter and acrid. Soubeiran maintains that it can be\r\nrecognised if 1 part is dissolved in 500,000 parts of water. If nitric\r\ntrioxide be passed into an alcoholic solution of brucine, first brucine\r\nnitrate is formed; but this passes again into solution, from which,\r\nafter a time, a heavy, granular, blood-red precipitate separates: it\r\nconsists of dinitro-brucine (C₂₃H₂₄(NO₂)₂N₂O₄). Brucine fully\r\nneutralises acids, and forms salts, which are for the most part\r\ncrystalline. The neutral sulphate (C₂₃H₂₅N₂O₄SH₂O₄ + 3½H₂O) is in long\r\nneedles, easily soluble in water. The acetate is not crystalline, that\r\nof strychnine is so (p. 321).\r\n\r\nBrucine is precipitated by ammonia, by the caustic and carbonated\r\nalkalies, and by most of the group reagents. Ammonia does not\r\nprecipitate brucine, if in excess; on the other hand, strychnine comes\r\ndown if excess of ammonia is added immediately. This has been proposed\r\nas a method of separation; if the two alkaloids are present in acid\r\nsolution, ammonia in excess is added, and the solution is immediately\r\nfiltered; the quantitative results are, however, not good, the\r\nstrychnine precipitate being invariably contaminated by brucine.\r\n\r\nChromate and dichromate of potassium give no precipitate with neutral\r\nsalts of brucine; on the other hand, strychnine chromate is at once\r\nformed if present. It might, therefore, be used to separate strychnine\r\nfrom brucine. The author has attempted this method, but the results were\r\nnot satisfactory.\r\n\r\n§ 402. =Physiological Action.=--The difference between the action of\r\nstrychnine and that of brucine on man or animals is not great. Mays\r\nstates that strychnine affects more the anterior, brucine the posterior\r\nextremities. In strychnine poisoning, convulsions occur early, and\r\ninvariably take place before death; but death may occur from brucine\r\nwithout any convulsions, and in any case they develop late. Brucine\r\ndiminishes local sensibility when applied to the skin; strychnine does\r\nnot.[454] In a physiological sense, brucine may be considered a diluted\r\nstrychnine. The lethality of brucine, especially as compared with\r\nstrychnine, has been investigated by F. A. Falck.[455] He experimented\r\non 11 rabbits, injecting subcutaneously brucine nitrate, in doses of\r\nvarying magnitude, from 100 mgrms. down to 20 mgrms. per kilogram of\r\nbody-weight. He found that brucine presented three stages of symptoms.\r\nIn the first, the respiration is quickened; in 3 of the 11 cases a\r\nstrange injection of the ear was noticed; during this period the pupils\r\nmay be dilated. In the second stage, there are tetanic convulsions,\r\ntrismus, opisthotonus, oppressed respiration, and dilated pupils. In the\r\nthird stage, the animal is moribund. Falck puts the minimum lethal dose\r\nfor rabbits at 23 mgrms. per kilo. Strychnine kills 3·06 times more\r\nquickly than brucine, the intensity of the action of strychnine relative\r\nto that of brucine being as 1 : 117·4. Falck has also compared the\r\nminimum lethal dose of strychnine and brucine with the tetanising opium\r\nalkaloids, as shown in the following table:--\r\n\r\n[454] _Journ. Physiol._, viii. 391-403.\r\n\r\n[455] _Brucin u. Strychnin; eine toxikologische Parallele_, von Dr. F.\r\nA. Falck. _Vierteljahrsschr. f. gerichtl.

(about 24·6 grains) of brucine nitrate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Brucine Crystals. (_From a Photograph._)]\r\n\r\n§ 403. Tests.--If to a solution of brucine in strong alcohol a little\r\nmethyl iodide is added, at the end of a few minutes circular rosettes of\r\ncrystal groups appear (see fig.): they are composed of methyl brucine\r\niodide (C₂₃H₂₅(CH₃)N₂O₄HI). Crystals identical in shape are also\r\nobtained if an alcoholic solution of iodine, or hydriodic acid with\r\niodine, is added to an alcoholic solution of brucine. A solution of\r\nstrychnine gives with methyl iodide no similar reaction. Strychnine in\r\nalcoholic solution, mixed with, brucine in no way interferes with the\r\ntest. The methyl iodide test may be confirmed by the action of nitric\r\nacid. With that reagent it produces a scarlet colour, passing into\r\nblood-red, into yellow-red, and finally ending in yellow. This can be\r\nmade something more than a mere colour test, for it is possible to\r\nobtain a crystalline body from the action of nitric acid on brucine. If\r\na little of the latter be put in a test-tube, and treated with nitric\r\nacid of 1·4 specific gravity (immersing the test-tube in cold water to\r\nmoderate the action), the red colour is produced. On spectroscopic\r\nexamination of the blood-red liquid a broad, well-marked absorption band\r\nis seen, the centre of which (_see_ page 55) is between E. & F. [W. L.\r\nabout 500]. There is also a development of nitric oxide and carbon\r\ndioxide, and the formation of methyl nitrite, oxalic acid, and kakotelin\r\n(C₂₃H₂₆N₂O₄ + 5NHO₃ = C₂₀H₂₂N₄O₉ + N(CH₃)O₂ + C₂H₂O₄ + 2NO + 2H₂O). On\r\ndiluting abundantly with water, the kakotelin separates in yellow\r\nflocks, and may be crystallised out of dilute hydrochloric or dilute\r\nnitric acid in the form of yellow or orange-red crystals, very insoluble\r\nin water, but dissolving readily in dilute acid. On removal by dilution\r\nof the product just named, neutralisation with ammonia, and addition of\r\na solution of chloride of calcium, the oxalate of lime is thrown down.\r\nThe nitric acid test is, therefore, a combined test, consisting of--the\r\nproduction by the action of nitric acid (1) of a red colour; (2) of\r\nyellow scales or crystals insoluble in water; (3) of oxalic acid. No\r\nalkaloid save brucine is known to give this reaction.\r\n\r\nThere are other methods of producing the colour test. If a few drops of\r\nnitric acid are mixed with the substance in a test-tube, and then\r\nsulphuric acid cautiously added, so as to form a layer at the bottom, at\r\nthe junction of the liquids a red zone, passing into yellow, is seen.\r\n\r\nA solution of brucine is also coloured red by chlorine gas, ammonia\r\nchanging the colour into yellow.\r\n\r\nFlückiger[456] has proposed as a test mercurous nitrate, in aqueous\r\nsolution with a little free nitric acid. On adding this reagent to a\r\nsolution of brucine salt, and gently warming, a fine carmine colour is\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\n[456] _Archiv f. Pharm._ (3), vi. 404.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the separation of brucine from organic fluids or tissues,\r\nthe process already detailed for strychnine suffices. It is of very\r\ngreat importance to ascertain whether both strychnine and brucine are\r\npresent or not--the presence of both pointing to nux vomica or one of\r\nits preparations. The presence of brucine may, of course, be owing to\r\nimpure strychnine; but if found in the tissues, that solution of the\r\nquestion is improbable, the commercial strychnine of the present day\r\nbeing usually pure, or at the most containing so small a quantity of\r\nbrucine as would hardly be separated from the tissues.\r\n\r\n    § 404. =Igasurine= is an alkaloid as yet but little studied; it\r\n    appears that it can be obtained from the boiling-hot watery extract\r\n    of nux vomica seeds, through precipitating the strychnine and\r\n    brucine by lime, and evaporation of the filtrate. According to\r\n    Desnoix,[457] it forms white crystals containing 10 per cent. of\r\n    water of crystallisation.\r\n\r\n[457] _Journ. Pharm._ (3), xxv. 202.\r\n\r\n    It is said to be poisonous, its action being similar to that of\r\n    strychnine and brucine, and in activity standing midway between the\r\n    two.\r\n\r\n    § 405. _Strychnic Acid._--Pelletier and Caventou obtained by boiling\r\n    with spirit small, hard, warty crystals of an organic acid, from _S.\r\n    ignatius_, as well as from nux vomica seeds. The seeds were first\r\n    exhausted by ether, the alcohol solution was filtered and\r\n    evaporated, and the extract treated with water and magnesia,\r\n    filtered, and the residue first washed with cold water, then with\r\n    hot spirit, and boiled lastly with a considerable quantity of water.\r\n    The solution thus obtained was precipitated with acetate of lead,\r\n    the lead thrown out by SH₂, and the solution evaporated, the acid\r\n    crystallising out. It is a substance as yet imperfectly studied, and\r\n    probably identical with malic acid.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. THE QUEBRACHO GROUP OF ALKALOIDS.\r\n\r\n    § 406. The bark of the _Quebracho Blanco_[458] (_Aspidosperma\r\n    quebracho_) contains, according to Hesse’s researches, no fewer than\r\n    six alkaloids--Quebrachine, Aspidospermine, Aspidospermatine,\r\n    Aspidosamine, and Hypoquebrachine. The more important of these are\r\n    _Aspidospermine_ and _Quebrachine_.\r\n\r\n[458] See Liebig’s _Annal._, 211, 249-282; _Ber. der deutsch. Chem.\r\nGesellsch._, 11, 2189; 12, 1560.\r\n\r\n    =Aspidospermine= (C₂₂H₃₀N₂O₂) forms colourless needles which melt at\r\n    206°. They dissolve in about 6000 parts of water at 14°--48 parts of\r\n    90 per cent. alcohol, and 106 parts of pure ether. The alkaloid\r\n    gives a fine magenta colour with perchloric acid.\r\n\r\n    =Quebrachine= (C₂₁H₂₆N₂O₃) crystallises in colourless needles,\r\n    melting-point (with partial decomposition) 215°. The crystals are\r\n    soluble in chloroform, with difficulty soluble in cold alcohol, but\r\n    easily in hot. The alkaloid, treated with sulphuric acid, and\r\n    peroxide of lead, strikes a beautiful blue colour. It also gives\r\n    with sulphuric acid and potassic chromate the strychnine colours.\r\n    Quebrachine, dissolved in sulphuric acid containing iron, becomes\r\n    violet-blue, passing into brown. The alkaloid, treated with strong\r\n    sulphuric acid, becomes brown; on adding a crystal of potassic\r\n    nitrate, a blue colour is developed; on now neutralising with\r\n    caustic soda no red coloration is perceived. Dragendorff has\r\n    recently studied the best method of extracting these alkaloids for\r\n    toxicological purposes. He recommends extraction of the substances\r\n    with sulphuric acid holding water, and shaking up with solvents.\r\n    Aspidospermine is not extracted by petroleum ether or benzene from\r\n    an acid watery extract, but readily by chloroform or by amyl\r\n    alcohol. It is also separated from the same solution, alkalised by\r\n    ammonia, by either amyl alcohol or chloroform; with difficulty by\r\n    petroleum ether; some is dissolved by benzene. Quebrachine may be\r\n    extracted from an acid solution by chloroform, but not by petroleum\r\n    ether. Alkalised by ammonia, it dissolves freely in chloroform and\r\n    in amyl alcohol. Traces are taken up by petroleum, somewhat more by\r\n    benzene. Aspidospermine is gradually decomposed in the body, but\r\n    Quebrachine is more resistant, and has been found in the stomach,\r\n    intestines, blood, and urine. The toxicological action of the bark\r\n    ranks it with the tetanic class of poisons. In this country it does\r\n    not seem likely to attain any importance as a poison.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. PEREIRINE.\r\n\r\n    § 407. =Pereirine=--an alkaloid from pereira bark--gives a play of\r\n    colours with sulphuric acid and potassic bichromate similar to but\r\n    not identical with that of strychnine. Fröhde’s reagent strikes\r\n    with it a blue colour. On dissolving pereirine in dilute sulphuric\r\n    acid, and precipitating by gold chloride, the precipitate is a\r\n    beautiful red, which, on standing and warming, is deepened.\r\n    Pereirine may be extracted from an acid solution, after alkalising\r\n    with ammonia, by ether or benzene.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. GELSEMINE.\r\n\r\n    § 408. Gelsemine (C₂₂H₂₈N₂O₄) is an alkaloid[459] which has been\r\n    separated from _Gelsemium sempervirens_, the Carolina jessamine, a\r\n    plant having affinities with several natural orders, and placed by\r\n    De Candolle among the _Loganiaceæ_, by Chapman among the _Rubiaceæ_\r\n    and by Decaisne among the _Apocynaceæ_. It grows wild in Virginia\r\n    and Florida.[460] Gelsemine is a strong base; it is yellowish when\r\n    impure, but a white amorphous powder when pure. It fuses below 100°\r\n    into a transparent vitreous mass, at higher temperatures it\r\n    condenses on glass in minute drops; its taste is extremely bitter;\r\n    it is soluble in 25 parts of ether, in chloroform, bisulphide of\r\n    carbon, benzene, and in turpentine; it is not very soluble in\r\n    alcohol, and still less soluble in water, but it freely dissolves in\r\n    acidulated water. The caustic alkalies precipitate it, the\r\n    precipitate being insoluble in excess; it is first white, but\r\n    afterwards brick-red. Tannin, picric acid, iodised potassic iodide,\r\n    platinic chloride, potassio-mercuric iodide, and mercuric chloride\r\n    all give precipitates. Fröhde’s reagent gives with gelsemine a brown\r\n    changing to green.\r\n\r\n[459] Dr. T. G. Wormley separated, in 1870, a non-nitrogenised\r\nremarkably fluorescent body, which he named gelsemic acid (_Amer. Journ.\r\nof Pharm._, 1870), but Sonnenschein and C. Robbins afterwards found\r\ngelsemic acid to be identical with æsculin (_Ber. der deutsch. Chem.\r\nGes._, 1876, 1182). Dr. Wormley has, however, contested this, stating\r\nthat there are differences. (_Amer. Journ. of Pharm._, 1882, p. 337.\r\n_Yearbook of Pharmacy_, 1882, p. 169.)\r\n\r\n[460] The following are its botanical characters:--Calyx five-parted,\r\ncorolla funnel-shaped, five-lobed, somewhat oblique, the lobes almost\r\nequal, the posterior being innermost in bud; stamens five; anthers\r\noblong sagittate, style long and slender; stigmas two, each two-parted,\r\nthe divisions being linear; fruit elliptical, flattened contrary to the\r\nnarrow partition, two-celled, septicidally two-valved, the valves\r\nkeeled; seeds five to six in each cell, large, flat, and winged; embryo\r\nstraight in fleshy albumen; the ovate flat, cotyledons much shorter than\r\nthe slender radicle; stem smooth, twining and shrubby; leaves opposite,\r\nentire, ovate, or lanceolate, shining on short petioles, nearly\r\npersistent; flowers large, showy, very fragrant, yellow, one to five in\r\nthe axil of the leaves.\r\n\r\n    Sulphuric acid dissolves gelsemine with a reddish or brownish\r\n    colour; after a time it assumes a pinkish hue, and if warmed on the\r\n    water-bath, a more or less purple colour; if a small crystal of\r\n    potassic bichromate be slowly stirred in the sulphuric acid\r\n    solution, reddish purple streaks are produced along the path of the\r\n    crystal; ceric oxide exhibits this better and more promptly, so\r\n    small a quantity as ·001 grain showing the reaction. This reaction\r\n    is something like that of strychnine, but nitric acid causes\r\n    gelsemine to assume a brownish-green, quickly changing to a deep\r\n    green--a reaction which readily distinguishes gelsemine from\r\n    strychnine and other alkaloids.\r\n\r\n    § 409. =Fatal Dose.=--10 mgrms. killed a frog within four hours, and\r\n    8 mgrms. a cat within fifteen minutes. A healthy woman took an\r\n    amount of concentrated tincture, which was equivalent to 11 mgrms.\r\n    (⅙ grain), and died in seven and a half hours.\r\n\r\n    § 410. =Effects on Animals--Physiological Action.=--Gelsemine acts\r\n    powerfully on the respiration; for example, Drs. Sydney Ringer and\r\n    Murrell[461] found, on operating on the frog, that in two minutes\r\n    the breathing had become distinctly slower; in three and a half\r\n    minutes, it had been reduced by one-third; and in six minutes, by\r\n    one-half; at the expiration of a quarter of an hour, it was only\r\n    one-third of its original frequency; and in twenty minutes, it was\r\n    so shallow and irregular that it could no longer be counted with\r\n    accuracy. In all their experiments they found that the respiratory\r\n    function was abolished before reflex and voluntary motion had become\r\n    extinct. In several instances the animals could withdraw their legs\r\n    when their toes were pinched, days after the most careful\r\n    observations had failed to detect the existence of any respiratory\r\n    movement. The heart was seen beating through the chest wall long\r\n    after the complete abolition of respiration.\r\n\r\n[461] _Lancet_, vol. i., 1876, p. 415.\r\n\r\n    In their experiments on warm-blooded animals (cats), they noticed\r\n    that in a few minutes the respirations were slowed down to 12 and\r\n    even to 8, and there was loss of power of the posterior extremities,\r\n    while at short intervals the upper half of the body was convulsed.\r\n    In about half an hour paralysis of the hind limbs was almost\r\n    complete, and the respiratory movements so shallow that they could\r\n    not be counted. In the case of a dog, after all respiration had\r\n    ceased tracheotomy was performed, and air pumped in: the animal\r\n    recovered.\r\n\r\n    Ringer and Murrell consider that gelsemine produces no primary\r\n    quickening of the respiration, that it has no direct action on\r\n    either the diaphragm or intercostal muscles, that it paralyses\r\n    neither the phrenic nor the intercostal nerves, and that it\r\n    diminishes the rate of respiration after both vagi have been\r\n    divided. They do not consider that gelsemine acts on the cord\r\n    through Setschenow’s inhibitory centre, but that it destroys reflex\r\n    power by its direct action on the cord, and that probably it has no\r\n    influence on the motor nerves. Dr. Burdon Sanderson has also\r\n    investigated the action of gelsemine on the respiration, more\r\n    especially in relation to the movements of the diaphragm. He\r\n    operated upon rabbits; the animal being narcotised by chloral, a\r\n    small spatula, shaped like a teaspoon, was introduced into the\r\n    peritoneal cavity through an opening in the linea alba, and passed\r\n    upwards in front of the liver until its convex surface rested\r\n    against the under side of the centrum tendineum. The stem of the\r\n    spatula was brought into connection with a lever, by means of which\r\n    its to-and-fro movements (and consequently that of the diaphragm)\r\n    were inscribed. The first effect is to augment the depth but not the\r\n    frequency of the respiratory movements; the next is to diminish the\r\n    action of the diaphragm both in extent and frequency. This happens\r\n    in accordance with the general principle applicable to most cases of\r\n    toxic action--viz., that paresis of a central organ is preceded by\r\n    over-action. The diminution of movement upon the whole is\r\n    progressive, but this progression is interrupted, because the blood\r\n    is becoming more and more venous, and, therefore, the phenomena of\r\n    asphyxia are mixed up with the toxical effects. Dr. Sanderson\r\n    concludes that the drug acts by paralysing the automatic respiratory\r\n    centre; the process of extinction, which might be otherwise expected\r\n    to be gradual and progressive, is prevented from being so by the\r\n    intervention of disturbances of which the explanation is to be found\r\n    in the imperfect arterialisation of the circulating blood. Ringer\r\n    and Murrell have also experimented upon the action of gelsemine on\r\n    the frog’s heart. In all cases it decreased the number of beats; a\r\n    small fatal dose produced a white contracted heart, a large fatal\r\n    dose, a dark dilated heart; in either case arrest of the circulation\r\n    of course followed.\r\n\r\n    § 411. =Effects on Man.=--The preparations used in medicine are the\r\n    fluid extract and the tincture of gelsemine; the latter appears to\r\n    contain the resin of the root as well as the active principle. There\r\n    are several cases on record of gelsemine, or the plant itself,\r\n    having been taken with fatal effect.[462] Besides a marked effect on\r\n    the respiration, there is an effect upon the eye, better seen in man\r\n    than in the lower animals; the motor nerves of the eye are attacked\r\n    first, objects cannot be fixed, apparently dodging their position,\r\n    the eyelids become paralysed, droop, and cannot be raised by an\r\n    effort of the will; the pupils are largely dilated, and at the same\r\n    time a feeling of lightness has been complained of in the tongue; it\r\n    ascends gradually to the roof of the mouth, and the pronunciation is\r\n    slurred. There is some paresis of the extremities, and they refuse\r\n    to support the body; the respiration becomes laboured, and the pulse\r\n    rises in frequency to 120 or 130 beats per minute, but the mind\r\n    remains clear. The symptoms occur in about an hour and a half after\r\n    taking an overdose of the drug, and, if not excessive, soon\r\n    disappear, leaving no unpleasantness behind. If, on the other hand,\r\n    the case proceeds to a fatal end, the respiratory trouble increases,\r\n    and there may be convulsions, and a course very similar to that seen\r\n    in experimenting on animals. Large doses are especially likely to\r\n    produce tetanus, which presents some clinical differences\r\n    distinguishing it from strychnine tetanus. Gelsemine tetanus is\r\n    always preceded by a loss of voluntary reflex power, respiration\r\n    ceases before the onset of convulsions, the posterior extremities\r\n    are most affected, and irritation fails to excite another paroxysm\r\n    till the lapse of some seconds, as if the exhausted cord required\r\n    time to renew its energy; finally, the convulsions only last a short\r\n    time.\r\n\r\n[462] See _Lancet_, 1873, vol. ii. p. 475; _Brit. Med. and Surg.\r\nJourn._, April 1869; _Phil. Med. and Surg. Reporter_, 1861.\r\n\r\n    § 412. _Extraction from Organic Matters, or the Tissues of the\r\n    Body._--Dragendorff states that, from as little as half a grain of\r\n    the root, both gelsemine and gelsemic acid may be extracted with\r\n    acid water, and identified. On extracting with water acidified with\r\n    sulphuric acid, and shaking up the acid liquid with chloroform, the\r\n    gelsemic acid (æsculin?) is dissolved, and the gelsemine left in the\r\n    liquid. The chloroform on evaporation leaves gelsemic acid in little\r\n    micro-crystals; it may be identified by (1) its crystallising in\r\n    little tufts of crystals; (2) its strong fluorescent properties, one\r\n    part dissolved in 15,000,000 parts of water showing a marked\r\n    fluorescence, which is increased by the addition of an alkali; and\r\n    (3) by splitting up into sugar and another body on boiling with a\r\n    mineral acid. After separation of gelsemic acid, the gelsemine is\r\n    obtained by alkalising the liquid, and shaking up with fresh\r\n    chloroform; on separation of the chloroform, gelsemine may be\r\n    identified by means of the reaction with nitric acid, and also the\r\n    reaction with potassic bichromate and sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. COCAINE.\r\n\r\n    § 413. =Cocaine= (C₁₇H₂₁NO₄).--There are two cocaines--the one\r\n    rotating a ray of polarised light to the left, the other to the\r\n    right. The left cocaine is contained in the leaves of _Erythroxylon\r\n    coca_ with other alkaloids, and is in commerce.\r\n\r\n    Cocaine has been used most extensively in medicine since the year\r\n    1884--its chief use being as a local anæsthetic. Chemically cocaine\r\n    is a derivative of ecgonin, being ecgonin-methyl-ester. It has a\r\n    pyridine nucleus, and may be written\r\n    C₅H₄N(CH₃)--H₃CHO--(COC₆H₅)--CH₂COOCH₃, or expressed graphically as\r\n    follows:--\r\n\r\n     CH₂\r\n      /\\\r\n  CH /  \\CH₂\r\n    ║   |\r\n    ║Py |  H\r\n    ║   | /\r\n  CH \\  /C--CHO(C₆H₅CO)--CH₂COOCH₃.\r\n      \\/\r\n     NCH₃\r\n\r\n    =Properties.=--Cocaine is in the form of four- to six-sided prisms\r\n    of the monoclinic system. It is one of the few alkaloids which melt\r\n    under the temperature of boiling water, the melting-point being as\r\n    low as 85° in water. It readily furnishes a sublimate at 100°,\r\n    partially decomposing. On boiling with hydrochloric acid cocaine is\r\n    decomposed into methyl alcohol, ecgonin, and benzoic acid, according\r\n    to the following reaction:--\r\n\r\n                    Benzoic             Methyl\r\n  Cocaine.           acid.   Ecgonin.  Alcohol.\r\n  C₁₇H₂₁NO₄  + 2H₂O = C₆H₅COOH + C₉H₁₅NO₃  + CH₃OH.\r\n\r\n    Cocaine is but little soluble in water, but easily dissolves in\r\n    ether, alcohol, benzene, chloroform, and carbon disulphide; an\r\n    aqueous solution is alkaline to methyl-orange, but not to\r\n    phenol-phthalein. It can be made synthetically by the reaction of\r\n    ecgonin-methyl-ester with benzoyl chloride.\r\n\r\n§ 414. =Cocaine Hydrochlorate= (C₁₇H₂₁NO₄HCl).--Crystallised from\r\nalcohol, cocaine hydrochlorate appears in prismatic crystals; these\r\ncrystals, according to Hesse,[463] when perfectly pure, should melt at\r\n186°, although the melting-point is generally given as 200° or even\r\n202°. Cocaine hydrochlorate is soluble in half its weight of water,\r\ninsoluble in dry ether, but readily soluble in alcohol, amyl alcohol, or\r\nchloroform.\r\n\r\n[463] O. Hesse, _Annalen_, 276, 342-344.\r\n\r\n§415. =Pharmaceutical Preparations.=--Cocaine hydrochlorate is\r\nofficinal. Gelatine discs, weighing 1·31 mgrms. (1/50 grain), and each\r\ncontaining 0·33 mgrm. (1/200 grain) of the salt are officinal, and used\r\nby ophthalmic surgeons. A solution of the hydrochlorate, containing 10\r\nper cent. of cocaine hydrochlorate and (for the purposes of preserving\r\nthe solution) 0·15 per cent. of salicylic acid is also officinal.\r\nStronger solutions may also be met with; for instance, a 20 per cent.\r\nsolution in oil of cloves for external application in cases of\r\nneuralgia.\r\n\r\n§416. =Separation of Cocaine and Tests.=--Cocaine may be shaken out of\r\nsolutions made slightly alkaline by ammonia by treatment with benzene;\r\nit also passes into petroleum ether under the same circumstances. The\r\nbest method is to extract a solution, made feebly alkaline, thoroughly\r\nby ether, and then shake it out by benzene and evaporate the separated\r\nbenzene at the ordinary air temperature. The property of the alkaloid to\r\nmelt at or below the temperature of boiling water, and the ready\r\ndecomposition into benzoic acid and other products, render cocaine easy\r\nof identification. If, for instance, a small particle of cocaine is put\r\nin a tube, a drop of strong sulphuric acid added and warmed by the\r\nwater-bath, colourless crystals of benzoic acid sublime along the tube,\r\nand an aromatic odour is produced.\r\n\r\nFlückiger has recommended the production of benzoate of iron as a useful\r\ntest both for cocaine and for cocaine hydrochlorate.\r\n\r\nOne drop of a dilute solution of ferric chloride added to a solution of\r\n20 mgrms. of cocaine hydrochlorate in 2 c.c. of water, gives a yellow\r\nfluid, which becomes red on boiling from the production of iron\r\nbenzoate. This reaction is of little use unless a solution of the same\r\nstrength of ferric chloride, but to which the substance to be tested has\r\nnot been added, is boiled at the same time for comparison, because all\r\nsolutions of ferric chloride deepen in colour on heating.\r\n\r\nA solution of the alkaloid evaporated to dryness on the water-bath,\r\nafter being acidulated with nitric acid, and then a few drops of\r\nalcoholic solution of potash or soda added, develops an odour of benzoic\r\nethyl-ester. Cocaine hydrochlorate, when triturated with calomel,\r\nblackens by the slightest humidity or by moistening it with alcohol.\r\nCocaine in solution is precipitated by most of the group reagents, but\r\nis not affected by mercuric chloride, picric acid, nor potassic\r\nbichromate.\r\n\r\nAdded to the tests above mentioned, there is the physiological action;\r\ncocaine dilates the pupil, tastes bitter, and, for the time, arrests\r\nsensation; hence the after-effect on the tongue is a sensation of\r\nnumbness.\r\n\r\n§ 417. =Symptoms.=--A large number of accidents occur each year from the\r\nexternal application of cocaine; few, however, end fatally. Cocaine has\r\nthus produced poisonous symptoms when applied to the eye, to the rectum,\r\nto the gums, to the urethra, and to various other parts. There have been\r\na few fatal cases, both from its external and internal administration;\r\nMannheim, for example, has collected eleven of such instances.\r\n\r\nThe action of cocaine is twofold; there is an action on the central and\r\nthe peripheral nervous system. In small doses cocaine excites the spinal\r\ncord and the brain; in large it may produce convulsions and then\r\nparalysis. The peripheral action is seen in the numbing of sensation.\r\nThere is always interference with the accommodation of vision, and\r\ndilatation of the pupil. The eyelids are wider apart than normal, and\r\nthere may be some protrusion of the eyeball.\r\n\r\nThe usual course of an acute case of poisoning is a feeling of dryness\r\nin the nose and throat, difficulty of swallowing, faintness, and there\r\nis often vomiting; the pulse is quickened; there is first cerebral\r\nexcitement, followed usually by great mental depression. Occasionally\r\nthere is an eruption on the skin. Hyperæsthesia of the skin is followed\r\nby great diminution of sensation, the pupils, as before stated, are\r\ndilated, the eyes protruding, the eyelids wide open, the face is pale,\r\nand the perspiration profuse. Convulsions and paralysis may terminate\r\nthe scene. Death takes place from paralysis of the breathing centre;\r\ntherefore the heart beats after the cessation of respiration. As an\r\nantidote, nitrite of amyl has apparently been used with success.\r\n\r\nThere is a form of chronic poisoning produced from the taking of small\r\ndoses of cocaine daily. The symptoms are very various, and are referable\r\nto disturbance of the digestive organs, and to the effect on the nervous\r\nsystem. The patients become extremely emaciated, and it seems to produce\r\na special form of mania.\r\n\r\n§ 418. =Post-mortem Appearances.=--The appearances found in acute cases\r\nof poisoning have been hyperæmia of the liver, spleen, and kidneys, as\r\nwell as of the brain and spinal cord.\r\n\r\nIn the experimental poisoning of mice with cocaine Ehrlich[464] found a\r\nconsiderable enlargement of the liver.\r\n\r\n[464] _Deutsche med. Wochens._, 1890, No. 32.\r\n\r\n§ 419. =Fatal Dose.=--The fatal dose, according to Mannheim,[465] must\r\nbe considered as about 1 grm. (15·4 grains); the smallest dose known to\r\nhave been fatal is 0·08 grm. (1·2 grain) for an adult, and 0·05 grm.\r\n(0·7 grain) for a child.\r\n\r\n[465] _Deutsch. Arch. f. klin. Med._, Bd. viii., 1891, 380.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. CORYDALINE.\r\n\r\n    § 420. =Corydaline= (C₂₂H₂₈NO₄) is an alkaloid discovered by\r\n    Wackenroder (1826) in the tubers of _Corydalis tuberosa_;\r\n    crystallised in the cold and away from light, out of a mixture of\r\n    absolute alcohol and ether, corydaline forms colourless, flat,\r\n    prismatic crystals, which quickly turn yellow on exposure to light\r\n    or heat. Pure corydaline changes colour at about 125°, softens at\r\n    about 133°, and melts finally at 134° to 135°. It dissolves in\r\n    ether, chloroform, carbon disulphide, and benzene, but not so\r\n    readily in alcohol. It is almost insoluble in cold water, and but\r\n    slightly soluble in boiling water. Water precipitates it from a\r\n    solution in alcohol. It is also soluble in dilute hydrochloric and\r\n    sulphuric acids. It gives a precipitate with potassium iodide if a\r\n    solution of the hydrochloride be used. The precipitate crystallises\r\n    out of hot water in clusters of short lemon-yellow prismatic\r\n    crystals, and has the formula of C₂₂H₂₈NO₄HI. Corydaline\r\n    platinochloride has the composition of (C₂₂H₂₈NO₄)₂H₂PtCl₆,\r\n    containing Pt 16·94 per cent., and 2·44 per cent. of N.--Dobbie &\r\n    Lauder, _Journ. Chem. Soc._, March 1892, 244.\r\n\r\n    Corydaline in large doses causes epileptiform convulsions. Death\r\n    takes place from respiratory paralysis.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.--The Aconite Group of Alkaloids.\r\n\r\n§ 421. The officinal aconite is the _Aconitum napellus_--monkshood or\r\nwolfsbane--a very common garden plant in this country, and one\r\ncultivated for medicinal purposes. Many varieties of aconite exist in\r\nother regions, which either are, or could be, imported. Of these the\r\nmost important is the _Aconitum ferox_, a native of the Himalayan\r\nmountains, imported from India.\r\n\r\nAll the aconites, so far as known, are extremely poisonous, and it\r\nappears probable that different species contain different alkaloids. The\r\nroot of _A. napellus_ is from 2 to 4 inches long, conical in shape,\r\nbrown externally, and white internally. The leaves are completely\r\ndivided at the base into five wedge-shaped lobes, each of the five lobes\r\nbeing again divided into three linear segments. The numerous seeds are\r\nthree-sided, irregularly twisted, wrinkled, of a dark-brown colour, in\r\nlength one-sixth of an inch, and weighing 25 to the grain (_Guy_). The\r\nwhole plant is one of great beauty, from 2 to 6 feet high, and having a\r\nterminal spike of conspicuous blue flowers. The root has been fatally\r\nmistaken for horse-radish, an error not easily accounted for, since no\r\nsimilarity exists between them.\r\n\r\n§ 422. =Pharmaceutical Preparations of Aconite.=--The preparations of\r\naconite used in medicine are--\r\n\r\n=Aconitine=, officinal in all the pharmacopœias.\r\n\r\n=Aconite liniment= (=linimentum aconiti=), made from the root with\r\nspirit, and flavoured with camphor; officinal in the British\r\nPharmacopœia. It may contain about 2·0 per cent. of aconitine.\r\n\r\n=Aconite tincture=, officinal in all the pharmacopœias.\r\n\r\n=Aconite ointment=, 8 grains of aconitine to the oz. (_i.e._, 1·66 per\r\ncent.); officinal in the British Pharmacopœia.\r\n\r\n=Aconite extract=, the juice of the leaves evaporated; officinal in most\r\nof the pharmacopœias. The strength in alkaloid of the extract varies; in\r\nsix samples examined by F. Casson, the least quantity was 0·16 per\r\ncent., the maximum 0·28 per cent.[466]\r\n\r\n[466] _Pharm. Journ._, 1894, 901.\r\n\r\n=Fleming’s tincture of aconite= is not officinal, but is sold largely in\r\ncommerce. It is from three to four times stronger than the B.P.\r\ntincture.\r\n\r\n§ 423. =The Alkaloids of Aconite.=--The researches of Dr. Alder Wright\r\nand Luff, and especially those of Professor Dunstan,[467] have\r\nestablished that in the root of the true aconite there exist four\r\nalkaloids, one only of which has been as yet crystallised.\r\n\r\n[467] Various papers in _Journ. Chem. Soc._, 1892-1894.\r\n\r\nThree of the alkaloids have been fairly well worked out; the fourth\r\nhomo-napelline has not yet been satisfactorily investigated.\r\n\r\nThe three alkaloids are aconitine, aconine and benzoyl-aconine; besides\r\nwhich pyraconitine and pyraconine can be obtained by suitable treatment\r\nfrom aconitine and aconine.\r\n\r\nThe formulæ of the alkaloids and their derivatives are as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Aconitine (acetyl-benzoyl-aconine),         m.p., 188·60°, C₃₃H₄₅NO₁₂\r\n  Benzoyl-aconine,                            m.p., 268·0°, C₃₁H₄₃NO₁₁\r\n  Pyraconitine (anhydro-benzoyl-aconine),     m.p., 188-190°, C₃₁H₄₁NO₁₀\r\n  Aconine,                                    m.p., 132°, C₂₄H₃₉NO₁₀\r\n  Pyraconine (anhydro-aconine),                          C₂₄H₃₇NO₉\r\n\r\n§ 424. =Aconitine=, C₃₃H₄₅NO₁₂.--This base has been shown by Dunstan to\r\nbe acetyl-benzoyl-aconine; one molecule of the base breaking up, on\r\ncomplete hydrolysis, into one molecule of aconine, one of acetic acid,\r\nand one of benzoic acid--\r\n\r\n                  Acetic  Benzoic\r\n                   Acid.   Acid.   Aconine.\r\n  C₃₃H₄₅NO₁₂ + 2H₂O = C₂H₄O₂ + C₇H₆O₂ + C₂₄H₃₉NO₁₀.\r\n\r\nThat is to say that 100 parts of aconitine, according to theory, should\r\nyield:--\r\n\r\nAcetic acid, 9·37 per cent.; benzoic acid, 18·85 per cent.; and aconine,\r\n77·52 per cent.\r\n\r\nPure aconitine has a tube melting-point of 188·6°. The behaviour of a\r\nsample of Merck’s aconitine in the subliming cell, which had a\r\nmelting-point of 184°, was as described at page 259.\r\n\r\nAconitine dissolves in water at 22° in the proportion of 1 in 4431\r\n(_Dunstan_); it is soluble in 37 of absolute alcohol, 64 of anhydrous\r\nether, 5·5 parts of chloroform and benzene (_A. Jurgens_); it has basic\r\nproperties, and a cold watery solution has an alkaline reaction to\r\ncochineal, but not to litmus nor to phenol-phthalein. Aconitine is not\r\nprecipitated by mercuric potassium iodide, but gives a voluminous\r\nprecipitate with an aqueous solution of iodine in potassium iodide.\r\n\r\nIt gives a crystalline yellow gold compound with gold chloride, which\r\nhas a melting-point of 135·5°, and according to its composition,\r\nC₃₃H₄₅NO₁₂HAuCl₄, should give 19·9 per cent. of gold.\r\n\r\nAconitine is best extracted from the plant, or from organic matters\r\ngenerally, by a 1 per cent. sulphuric acid; this strength is stated not\r\nto hydrolyse aconitine if acting in the cold; after purifying the acid\r\nliquid by shaking it with amyl alcohol, and then with chloroform,\r\n_always operating in the cold_, the liquid is precipitated by ammonia in\r\nvery slight excess, and the liquid shaken with ether; the ether is\r\nremoved, dehydrated by standing over calcium chloride, and then\r\nevaporated spontaneously; should the aconitine be mixed with the other\r\nalkaloids, advantage can be taken of the method of separating\r\naconitine by converting it into hydrobromide, as described under\r\n“Benzoyl-aconine.”\r\n\r\n§ 425. =Tests for Aconitine.=--The most satisfactory and the most\r\ndelicate is the physiological test; the minutest trace of an\r\naconite-holding liquid, applied to the tongue or lips, causes a peculiar\r\nnumbing, tingling sensation which, once felt, can readily be remembered.\r\n\r\nAn alkaloidal substance which, heated in a tube, melts approximately\r\nnear the melting-point of aconitine, and gives off an acid vapour, would\r\nrender one suspicious of aconitine, for most alkaloids give off alkaline\r\nvapours. Aconitine also may, by heating with dilute acids, be made to\r\nreadily yield benzoic acid, an acid easy of identification. Aconitine\r\ndissolved in nitric acid, evaporated to dryness, and then treated with\r\nalcoholic potash, gives off an unmistakable odour of benzoic ester.\r\n\r\nShould there be sufficient aconitine recovered to convert it into the\r\ngold salt, the properties of the gold salt (that is, its melting-point,\r\nand the percentage of gold left after burning) assist materially in the\r\nidentification.\r\n\r\nA minute quantity of aconitine dissolved in water, acidified with\r\nacetic acid, and a particle of KI added and the solution allowed to\r\nevaporate, gives crystals of aconitine hydriodide, from which water will\r\ndissolve out the KI. Iodine water gives a precipitate of a reddish-brown\r\ncolour in a solution of 1 : 2000.[468]\r\n\r\n[468] A. Jurgens, _Arch. Pharm._ (3), xxiv. 127, 128.\r\n\r\nThe chemical tests are supplementary to the physiological; if the\r\nalkaloidal extract does not give the tingling, numbing sensation,\r\naconitine cannot be present.\r\n\r\n§ 426. =Benzoyl-aconine (“isaconitine”)=, C₃₁H₄₃NO₁₁, is obtained from\r\naconitine by heating an aqueous solution of the sulphate or\r\nhydrochloride in a closed tube at 120°-130° for two or three hours, a\r\nmolecule of acetic acid (9·27 per cent.) being split off, and\r\nbenzoyl-aconine left.\r\n\r\nIt may be separated from the mixed alkaloids of the _Aconitum napellus_\r\nby dissolving in a 5 per cent. solution of hydrobromic acid (excess of\r\nacid being avoided), precipitating with a slight excess of ammonia, and\r\nshaking out with ether. The residue left after the ether is evaporated\r\nchiefly consists of aconitine; it is dissolved in just sufficient\r\nhydrobromic acid and the exactly neutral hydrobromate solution allowed\r\nto evaporate spontaneously in a desiccator; crystals of aconitine\r\nhydrobromide separate out, the mother liquor containing some\r\nbenzoyl-aconine and “homonapelline.” The aqueous solution which has been\r\nexhausted with ether is now shaken out with chloroform. This chloroform\r\nsolution contains most of the benzoyl-aconine, and on separation the\r\nresidue is dissolved in just sufficient hydrochloric acid to form a\r\nneutral solution; this solution is concentrated on the water-bath with\r\nconstant stirring, crystals of the hydrochloride form, and are filtered\r\noff from time to time and washed with a little cold water, the washings\r\nbeing added to the original liquid; the different fractions are mixed\r\ntogether, and the process repeated until they have a melting-point of\r\n268°. Benzoyl-aconine is obtained from the hydrochloride by\r\nprecipitating the aqueous solution by the addition of dilute ammonia,\r\nand extracting the solution with ether; the solution in ether is washed\r\nwith water, dried by means of calcium chloride, and then distilled off.\r\nBenzoyl-aconine is left as a transparent colourless non-crystalline\r\nvarnish of a melting-point near 125°.\r\n\r\nThe solution in water is alkaline to litmus. The base is readily soluble\r\nin alcohol, in chloroform, and in ether. The alcoholic solution is\r\ndextrorotatory. The solutions are bitter, but do not give the tingling\r\nsensation characteristic of aconitine. The hydrochloride, the\r\nhydrobromide, the hydriodide, and the nitrate have been obtained in a\r\ncrystalline state. The most characteristic salt is, however, the\r\naurochlor derivative. When aqueous solutions of benzoyl-aconine chloride\r\nand auric chloride are mixed, a yellow precipitate is thrown down,\r\nwhich (dissolved in alcohol, after being dried over calcium chloride,\r\nand slowly evaporated in a desiccator) deposits colourless crystals\r\nentirely different from the yellow crystals of aconitine gold chloride.\r\nThese crystals have the composition C₃₁H₄₂(AuCl₂)NO₁₁, and therefore, by\r\ntheory, should yield 22·6 per cent. of gold, and 8·2 per cent. of\r\nchlorine.\r\n\r\nBy hydrolysis benzoyl-aconine yields benzoic acid, which can be shaken\r\nout of an acid solution by ether and identified; one molecule of benzoic\r\nacid is formed from one molecule of benzoyl-aconine. Twenty per cent. of\r\nbenzoic acid should, according to the formula, be obtained; Professor\r\nDunstan found only 18·85 per cent.[469]\r\n\r\n[469] Professor Dunstan found, as a means of two determinations, 21·6\r\nper cent. of gold, and 7·8 per cent. of chlorine, which comes nearer his\r\nold formula of C₃₃H₄₄(AuCl₂)NO₁₂.--_Journ. Chem. Soc._, April 1893.\r\n\r\nBenzoic acid in the subliming cell begins to give a cloud at about\r\n77°-80°, and at or near 100° sublimes most rapidly.\r\n\r\nBenzoic acid, recovered from an acid solution by shaking out with ether,\r\nmay be recognised as follows:--To the film left on evaporating off the\r\nether add a drop of H₂SO₄, and a few crystals of sodic nitrate, and heat\r\ngently for a short time; pour the clear liquid into ammonia water, and\r\nadd a drop of ammonium sulphide. A red-brown colour indicates benzoic\r\nacid. The _rationale_ of the test is as follows:--Dinitro-benzoic acid\r\nis first formed, and next, by the action of ammonium sulphide, this is\r\nconverted into the red-brown ammonium diamidobenzoate.--E. Mohler,\r\n_Bull. Soc. Chem._ (3), iii. 414-416.\r\n\r\n§ 427. =Pyraconitine=, C₃₁H₄₁NO₁₀, is anhydro-benzoyl-aconine; it\r\ndiffers from benzoyl-aconine by a molecule of water; picraconitine is\r\nobtained by keeping aconitine at its melting-point (188°-190°) for some\r\ntime, when acetic acid distils over and pyraconitine is left.\r\nPyraconitine is an amorphous varnish, sparingly soluble in water, but\r\nreadily dissolving in alcohol, chloroform, and ether; it gives a pale\r\nyellow precipitate with gold chloride, and forms crystalline salts with\r\nhydriodic, hydrobromic, and hydrochloric acids. Pyraconitine readily\r\nundergoes hydrolysis by the action of dilute acids, or by potash or\r\nsoda, or with water in a closed tube; the products are benzoic acid and\r\nan alkaloid, to which the name of pyraconine has been given.\r\n\r\n§ 428. =Pyraconine=, C₂₄H₃₇NO₉.--This base is anhydro-aconine, the\r\nformula differing from aconine by one atom of water. It is amorphous,\r\nclosely resembling aconine; it is soluble in water and ether; the\r\naqueous solution has a somewhat sweet taste, and is lævorotatory; it\r\ncombines with acids to form crystalline salts, which are very soluble in\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n§ 429. =Aconine=, C₂₄H₃₉NO₁₀, m.p. 132°.--Aconine does not crystallise.\r\nIts aqueous solution is decidedly alkaline, and, like aconitine, it is\r\nlævorotatory, although to a less degree. Its taste is bitter, but causes\r\nno tingling sensation. Aconine is very soluble in water or alcohol, and\r\nslightly in chloroform, but insoluble in ether or in petroleum ether. It\r\ndoes, however, dissolve, in the presence of aconitine, slightly in\r\nether. The aqueous solutions reduce the salts of gold and silver, and\r\nalso Fehling’s solution. A solution of aconine gives precipitates with\r\nthe general alkaloidal reagents; with mercuric chloride it gives a\r\ncopious yellow precipitate, which darkens on standing.\r\n\r\nAconine hydrochloride, the hydriodide, the hydrobromide, and the\r\nsulphate, have all been crystallised; solutions of these salts are\r\nlævorotatory.\r\n\r\n§ 430. =Commercial Aconitine and the Lethal Dose of\r\nAconitine.=--Commercial aconitine has in the past varied in appearance\r\nfrom that of a gummy amorphous mass up to a purer kind in white\r\ncrystals.\r\n\r\nProfessor Dunstan[470] has recently examined fourteen samples, some of\r\nthem of considerable age, and only found two samples (one of English,\r\nanother of German make) which approached in melting-point and\r\ncrystalline appearance pure aconitine; the one, the English, melted at\r\n186°-187°, and contained about 3 per cent. of benzoyl-aconine; the\r\nother, a German specimen, was almost pure; the melting-point was 187·5°.\r\nAt the present time it is, however, not difficult to obtain fairly pure\r\ncrystalline aconitine, and to assay it accurately by determining the\r\nproportion of acetic and benzoic acids. The physiological action of\r\ncommercial aconitine is, however, in all cases the same, the difference\r\nbeing in quantitative not qualitative action; in the small doses usually\r\nadministered, the physiological action depends wholly upon the true\r\naconitine present, the other bases being practically without toxic\r\naction. Professor Plugge[471] has made some researches on the fatal dose\r\n(for the lower animals) of Petit’s, Merck’s, and Friedländer’s aconitine\r\nnitrate, which in 1882 were the purest in commerce. He administered the\r\nfollowing doses to the animals mentioned:--\r\n\r\n[470] _Journ. Chem. Soc.

Dr. Harley experimented on a\r\nyoung cat, 3 lbs. in weight, and nearly killed it with a 1/1000 of a\r\ngrain of Morson’s aconitine; two other cats, also weighing 3 lbs. each,\r\ndied in seven and a half hours and three-quarters of an hour\r\nrespectively, killed from a subcutaneous dose of of a grain. Reducing\r\nthese values to the ordinary equivalents, the dose, after which the cat\r\nrecovered with difficulty, is equal to about ·048 mgrm. per kilo.,\r\nwhile a certainly fatal dose is ·092 mgrm. per kilo.; therefore, it\r\nseems likely that the least fatal dose for Morson’s, as for Petit’s, is\r\nsome number between ·075 and ·09 mgrm. per kilo.\r\n\r\n[472] “On the Action and Use of Aconitine,” _St. Thos. Hosp. Report_,\r\n1874.\r\n\r\nMan is evidently more sensitive to aconitine than any of the dogs or\r\ncats experimented upon, since, in the German cases to be recorded, 1·6\r\nmgrm. of Petit’s aconitine nitrate, taken by the mouth, gave rise to\r\nsymptoms so violent that it was evidently a dangerous dose, while 4\r\nmgrms. were rapidly fatal; but if man took the same amount per kilo. as\r\ndogs or cats, he would require a little over 6 mgrms. to be certainly\r\nfatal. It seems, then, from the evidence obtainable, that ·03 grain (2\r\nmgrms.) is about the least fatal dose for an adult man of standard\r\nweight. This dose is equal to ·028 mgrm. per kilo., and, of course,\r\nrefers either to Morson’s aconitine or French aconitine, the alkaloid\r\nbeing taken by the mouth. If given by subcutaneous injection, probably\r\n1·5 mgrm. would kill, for the whole of the poison is then thrown on the\r\ncirculation at one time, and there is no chance of its elimination by\r\nvomiting.\r\n\r\nThe lethal dose of the pure alkaloid being even approximately settled,\r\nit is possible to get a more exact idea as to the suitable medicinal\r\ndose of the tincture and extract, and also to study more profitably the\r\n“quantitative toxicity.” The English officinal tincture, although\r\nvariable in strength, may for our purposes be regarded as averaging 1\r\nper cent. of alkaloid--that is, in every 100 parts by volume there will\r\nbe 1 part of the alkaloid by weight, and Fleming’s tincture may be\r\nconsidered as one-third stronger, containing in every 100 parts 1·3 part\r\nof alkaloid. The medicinal dose of the P.B. tincture is laid down as\r\nfrom 5 to 15 min.--equal to from ·005 to ·015 grain of aconitine. The\r\nGerman pharmacopœia gives the maximum single dose as 1 c.c. (say 15\r\nmins.), and the maximum quantity to be taken in the twenty-four hours as\r\nfour times that quantity. As before stated, 2 mgrms. (·030 grain) of\r\naconitine being considered a fatal dose, this is equivalent to about 2\r\nc.c. (30 mins.) of the P.B. tincture, or to 1·2 c.c. (20 mins.) of\r\nFleming’s tincture in a single dose; and on these theoretical grounds I\r\nshould consider this dose dangerous, and in the absence of prompt\r\ntreatment likely to be fatal to an adult man. The usual least fatal dose\r\nlaid down in medical toxicological works, however, is greater than\r\nthis--viz., 3·75 c.c. (a drachm).\r\n\r\nIn 1863 a woman took 70 minims of Fleming’s tincture, and a grain of\r\nacetate of morphine, and died in about four hours; but as this was a\r\ncomplex case of poisoning, it is not of much value. Fifteen minims of\r\nthe tincture caused very serious symptoms in the case of a woman under\r\nthe care of Dr. Topham,[473] the effects lasting many hours. Probably\r\nthe smallest quantity of the tincture recorded as having destroyed life\r\nis in the case of Dr. Male, of Birmingham.[474] He died from the\r\neffects of 80 drops taken in ten doses, extending over a period of four\r\ndays--the largest dose at any one time being 10 drops, the total\r\nquantity would perhaps equal ·08 grain of aconitine.\r\n\r\n[473] _Lancet_, July 19, 1851, p. 56.\r\n\r\n[474] _Med. Gaz._, vol. xxxvi. p. 861, quoted by Taylor, _Prin. of Med.\r\nJuris._, vol. i. p. 426.\r\n\r\nThe P.B. extract is not a very satisfactory preparation, varying much in\r\nstrength. It may be taken to average about ·6 per cent., and if so,\r\napplying the same reasoning as before, from ·26 to ·32 grm. (4 to 5\r\ngrains) would be a fatal dose.[475] On the other hand, there is an\r\nalcoholic extract which is very powerful, and averages 5 per cent. of\r\naconitine: 40 mgrms. (·6 grain) of this extract would be likely to be\r\nfatal. With regard to the root itself, 3·8 grms. (60 grains) have been\r\nknown to produce death, and from the average alkaloidal contents it is\r\nprobable that ·648 grm. (10 grains) would be a highly dangerous dose.\r\nDunstan’s researches will now alter probably the whole of the pharmacy\r\nof aconite, and the tendency will be to make the preparations of greater\r\nactivity, and, consequently, to make the dangerous doses smaller than\r\nformerly.\r\n\r\n[475] But there is a case reported by Dr. Vachell, of Cardiff, in which\r\n2 grains of extract of aconite taken in pills proved fatal. Now 2 grains\r\nis the medicinal dose, laid down as a maximum in the pharmacopœia; a\r\ncomplete revolution is, therefore, necessary in the use of these active\r\nremedies. No extract or tincture should be used until its approximate\r\nstrength in active principles is determined.\r\n\r\n§ 431. =Effects of Aconitine on Animal Life.=--There are few substances\r\nwhich have been experimented upon in such a variety of ways and upon so\r\nmany classes of animals as aconitine in different forms; but there does\r\nnot seem to be any essential difference in the symptoms produced in\r\ndifferent animals save that which is explained by the organisation of\r\nthe life-form under experiment.\r\n\r\n=Insects.=--The author has made experiments with the active principles\r\nof aconite upon blow-flies. An extract was made by allowing the ordinary\r\ntincture to evaporate spontaneously at the temperature of the\r\natmosphere. If a minute dot of this is placed upon the head of a\r\nblow-fly, absorption of the active principle takes place in from fifteen\r\nto thirty minutes, and marked symptoms result. The symptoms consist\r\nessentially of muscular weakness, inability to fly, and to walk up\r\nperpendicular surfaces; there is also, in all cases, a curious\r\nentanglement of the legs, and very often extrusion of the proboscis;\r\ntrembling of the legs and muscular twitchings are frequent. A\r\nprogressive paralysis terminates in from four to five hours in death;\r\nthe death is generally so gradual that it is difficult to know when the\r\nevent occurs, but in one case there were violent movements of the body,\r\nand sudden death.[476]\r\n\r\n[476] It may be well to quote in full a typical experiment. Six P.M., a\r\nlittle extract smeared on the head of a blow-fly. Forty-five minutes\r\nafter--makes no attempt to fly, great muscular weakness, no trembling or\r\nconvulsive movements. Fifty minutes after--partial paralysis of right\r\nhalf of body, so that the fly, on moving, goes in a circular direction,\r\nthe second pair of legs are curiously bent forward and useless; the\r\nwings seem fairly strong. Seventy-five minutes--fly very dull, always in\r\none spot, without movement; when placed on a horizontal glass surface,\r\nand the glass then very slowly inclined, until it is at last quite\r\nperpendicular, the fly falls. There is now a strange entanglement of the\r\nlegs. 125 minutes--perfectly paralysed; 145 minutes--dead.\r\n\r\n=Fish.=--The action on fish has been studied by Schulz and Praag. There\r\nis rapid loss of power and diminished breathing; the respiration seems\r\ndifficult, and the fish rapidly die.\r\n\r\n=Reptiles--Frogs.=--The most recent experiments on frogs are those of\r\nPlugge, and although his interpretation of the phenomena in some points\r\nis different from that of previous observers, the symptoms themselves\r\nare, as might have been expected, not different from those described by\r\nAchscharumow, L. v. Praag, and others. Plugge found no qualitative\r\ndifference in the action of any of the commercial samples of aconitine.\r\nThis fact gives the necessary value to all the old experiments, for we\r\nnow know that, although they were performed with impure or weak\r\npreparations, yet there is no reason to believe that the symptoms\r\ndescribed were due to any other but the alkaloid aconitine in varying\r\ndegrees of purity or dilution. Frogs show very quickly signs of weakness\r\nin the muscular power; the respiration invariably becomes laboured, and\r\nceases after a few minutes; the heart’s action becomes slowed,\r\nirregular, and then stops in diastole. The poisoned heart, while still\r\npulsating, cannot be arrested either by electrical stimulation of the\r\nvagus or by irritation of the sinus, nor when once arrested can any\r\nfurther contraction be excited in it. Opening of the mouth and apparent\r\nefforts to vomit, Plugge observed both with _Rana esculenta_ and _Rana\r\ntemporaria_. He considers them almost invariable signs of aconitine\r\npoisoning. A separation of mucus from the surface of the body of the\r\nfrog is also very constantly observed. Dilatation of the pupils is\r\nfrequent, but not constant; there may be convulsions, both of a clonic\r\nand tonic character, before death, but fibrillar twitchings are seldom.\r\n(With regard to the dose required to affect frogs, see _ante_, pp. 355\r\nand 356.)\r\n\r\n=Birds.=--There is a discrepancy in the descriptions of the action of\r\naconitine on birds. L. v. Praag thought the respiration and circulation\r\nbut little affected at first; while Achscharumow witnessed in pigeons\r\ndyspnœa, dilatation of the pupils, vomiting, shivering, and paresis. It\r\nmay be taken that the usual symptoms observed are some difficulty in\r\nbreathing, a diminution of temperature, a loss of muscular power\r\ngenerally (but not constantly), dilatation of the pupils, and\r\nconvulsions before death.\r\n\r\n=Mammals.=--The effects vary somewhat, according to the dose. Very large\r\ndoses kill rabbits rapidly. They fall on their sides, are violently\r\nconvulsed, and die in an asphyxiated condition; but with smaller doses\r\nthe phenomena first observed are generally to be referred to the\r\nrespiration. Thus, in an experiment on the horse, Dr. Harley found that\r\nthe subcutaneous administration of ·6 mgrm. (·01 grain) caused in a\r\nweakly colt some acceleration of the pulse and a partial paralysis of\r\nthe dilator narium. Double the quantity given to the same animal some\r\ntime after, caused, in six hours and a half, some muscular weakness, and\r\nan evident respiratory trouble. The horse recovered in eighteen hours.\r\n2·7 mgrms. (1/24 grain) given in the same way, after a long interval of\r\ntime, caused, at the end of an hour, more pronounced symptoms; the\r\npulse, at the commencement 50, rose in an hour and a half to 68, then\r\nthe respiration became audible and difficult. In an hour and\r\nthree-quarters there were great restlessness and diminution of muscular\r\npower. Two hours after the injection the muscular weakness increased so\r\nmuch that the horse fell down; he was also convulsed. After eight hours\r\nhe began to improve. In another experiment, 32·4 mgrms. (½ grain) killed\r\na sturdy entire horse in two hours and twenty minutes, the symptoms\r\ncommencing within the hour, and consisting of difficulty of breathing,\r\nirregularity of the heart’s action, and convulsions.\r\n\r\nThe general picture of the effects of fatal, but not excessive, doses\r\ngiven to dogs, cats, rabbits, &c., resembles closely that already\r\ndescribed. The heart’s action is at first slowed, then becomes quick and\r\nirregular, there is dyspnœa, progressive paralysis of the muscular\r\npower, convulsions, and death in asphyxia. Vomiting is frequently\r\nobserved, sometimes salivation, and very often dilatation of the pupil.\r\nSometimes the latter is abnormally active, dilating and contracting\r\nalternately. Diarrhœa also occurs in a few cases. Vomiting is more\r\nfrequent when the poison is taken by the mouth than when administered\r\nsubcutaneously.[477]\r\n\r\n[477] The more important physiological researches on the action of\r\naconite are contained in the following works and papers:--\r\n\r\n    FLEMING, A.--_An Inquiry into the Physiological and Medicinal\r\n    Properties of the Aconitum napellus_, to which are added\r\n    observations on several other species of aconite, 8vo, Lond., 1845.\r\n\r\n    SCHULZ, F.

Six of the cases were from the use of the\r\nalkaloid itself; 10 were from the root; in two cases children eat the\r\nflowers; in 1, the leaves of the plant were cooked and eaten by mistake;\r\nin 7, the tincture was mistaken for brandy, sherry, or liqueur; the\r\nremainder were caused by the tincture, the liniment, or the extract.\r\n\r\n§ 434. =Poisoning by the Root.=--A case of murder which occurred some\r\nyears ago in America, and also the Irish case which took place in 1841\r\n(_Reg._ v. _M’Conkey_), were, until the recent trial of Lamson, the only\r\ninstances among English-speaking people of the use of aconite for\r\ncriminal purposes; but if we turn to the Indian records, we find that it\r\nhas been largely used from the earliest times as a destroyer of human\r\nlife. In 1842 a tank of water destined for the use of the British army\r\nin pursuit of the retreating Burmese, was poisoned by intentional\r\ncontamination with the bruised root of _Aconitum ferox_; it was\r\nfortunately discovered before any harm resulted. A preparation of the\r\nroot is used in all the hill districts of India to poison arrows for the\r\ndestruction of wild beasts. A Lepcha described the root to a British\r\nofficer as being “useful to sportsmen for destroying elephants and\r\ntigers, useful to the rich for putting troublesome relations out of the\r\nway, and useful to jealous husbands for the purpose of destroying\r\nfaithless wives.” From the recorded cases, the powdered root, mixed with\r\nfood, or the same substance steeped in spirituous liquor, is usually the\r\npart chosen for administration. In M’Conkey’s case, the man’s wife\r\npurchased powdered aconite root, mixed it with pepper, and strewed it\r\nover some greens, which she cooked and gave to him. The man complained\r\nof the sharp taste of the greens, and soon after the meal vomited, and\r\nsuffered from purging, became delirious with lock-jaw, and clenching of\r\nthe hands; he died in about three hours. The chief noticeable\r\n_post-mortem_ appearance was a bright red colour of the mucous membrane\r\nof the stomach.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms in this case were, in some respects, different from those\r\nmet with in other cases of poisoning by the root. A typical case is\r\ngiven by Dr. Chevers (_op. cit._), in which a man had taken by mistake a\r\nsmall portion of aconite root. Immediately after chewing it he felt a\r\nsweetish taste, followed immediately by tingling of the lips and tongue,\r\nnumbness of the face, and severe vomiting. On admission to hospital he\r\nwas extremely restless, tossing his limbs about in all directions and\r\nconstantly changing his position. He complained of a burning sensation\r\nin the stomach, and a tingling and numbness in every part of the body,\r\nexcepting his legs. The tingling was specially marked in the face and\r\ntongue--so much so that he was constantly moving the latter to and fro\r\nin order to scratch it against the teeth. Retching and vomiting occurred\r\nalmost incessantly, and he constantly placed his hand over the cardiac\r\nregion. His face was anxious, the eyes suffused, the lips pale and\r\nexsanguine, the eyelids swollen, moderately dilated, and insensible to\r\nthe stimulus of light; the respiration was laboured, 64 in a minute; the\r\npulse 66, small and feeble. There was inability to walk from loss of\r\nmuscular power, but the man was perfectly conscious. The stomach-pump\r\nwas used, and albumen and milk administered. Three and three-quarter\r\nhours after taking the root the symptoms were increased in severity. The\r\ntongue was red and swollen, the pulse intermittent, feeble, and slower.\r\nThe tingling and numbness had extended to the legs. On examining the\r\ncondition of the external sensibility with a pair of scissors, it was\r\nfound that, on fully separating the blades and bringing the points in\r\ncontact with the skin over the arms and forearms, he felt them as one,\r\nalthough they were 4 inches apart. But the sensibility of the thighs and\r\nlegs was less obtuse, for he could feel the two points distinctly when\r\nthey were 4 inches apart, and continued to do so until the distance\r\nbetween the points fell short of 2¾ inches. He began to improve about\r\nthe ninth hour, and gradually recovered, although he suffered for one or\r\ntwo days from a slight diarrhœa. As in the case detailed (p. 363), no\r\nwater was passed for a long time, as if the bladder early lost its\r\npower.\r\n\r\n§ 435. =Poisoning by the Alkaloid Aconitine.=--Probably the earliest\r\ninstance on record is the case related by Dr. Golding Bird in 1848.[478]\r\nWhat kind of aconitine was then in commerce I know not, and since\r\napparently a person of considerable social rank was the subject of the\r\npoisoning, the case has been imperfectly reported. It seems, however,\r\nthat, whether for purposes of suicide, or experiment, or as a medicine,\r\ntwo grains and a half of aconitine were swallowed. The symptoms were\r\nvery violent, consisting of vomiting, collapse, and attacks of muscular\r\nspasm; the narrator describes the vomiting as peculiar. “It, perhaps,\r\nhardly deserved that title; the patient was seized with a kind of\r\ngeneral spasm, during which he convulsively turned upon his abdomen,\r\nand with an intense contraction of the abdominal muscles, he jerked out,\r\nas it were, with a loud shout the contents of his stomach, dependent\r\napparently on the sudden contraction of the diaphragm.” On attempting to\r\nmake him swallow any fluid, a fearful spasm of the throat was produced;\r\nit reminded his medical attendants of hydrophobia. The patient recovered\r\ncompletely within twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n[478] _Lancet_, vol. i. p. 14.\r\n\r\nOne of three cases reported by Dr. Albert Busscher,[479] of poisoning by\r\naconitine nitrate, possesses all the exact details of an intentional\r\nexperiment, and is of permanent value to toxicological literature.\r\n\r\n[479] _Intoxicationsfälle durch Aconitin Nitricum Gallicum, nebst\r\nSections Bericht_, von Dr. Albert Busscher; _Berl. klinische\r\nWochenschrift_, 1880, No. 24, pp. 338, 356.\r\n\r\nA labourer of Beerta, sixty-one years of age, thin, and of somewhat weak\r\nconstitution, suffered from neuralgia and a slight intermittent fever;\r\nDr. Carl Meyer prescribed for his ailment:--\r\n\r\n  ℞. Aconiti Nitrici, 2 grm.\r\n     Tr. Chenopodii Ambrosioid., 100 grms. M.D.S.\r\n\r\nTwenty drops to be taken four times daily. The patient was instructed\r\nverbally by Dr. Meyer to increase the dose until he attained a maximum\r\nof sixty drops per day.\r\n\r\nThe doses which the man actually took, and the time of taking them, are\r\nconveniently thrown into a tabular form as follows:--\r\n\r\n  No. 1. March 14,  7 P.M.,  5 drops equal to aconitine nitrate,  ·4 mgrm.\r\n   „  2.   „        9 P.M., 20   „        „            „         1·6  „\r\n   „  3. March 15,  8 A.M., 20   „        „            „         1·6  „\r\n   „  4.   „       11 A.M., 20   „        „            „         1·6  „\r\n   „  5.   „        4 P.M., 20   „        „            „         1·6  „\r\n   „  6.   „        9 P.M., 20   „        „            „         1·6  „\r\n   „  7. March 16, 10 P.M., 10   „        „            „          ·8  „\r\n\r\nIn the whole seven doses, which were distributed over forty-eight hours,\r\nhe took 9·2 mgrms. (·14 grain) of aconitine nitrate.\r\n\r\nOn taking dose No. 1, he experienced a feeling of constriction\r\n(_Zusammenziehung_), and burning spreading from the mouth to the\r\nstomach, but this after a little while subsided. Two hours afterwards he\r\ntook No. 2, four times the quantity of No. 1. This produced the same\r\nimmediate symptoms, but soon he became cold, and felt very ill. He had\r\nan anxious oppressive feeling about the chest, with a burning feeling\r\nabout the throat; the whole body was covered with a cold sweat, his\r\nsight failed, he became giddy, there was excessive muscular weakness, he\r\nfelt as if he had lost power over his limbs, he had great difficulty in\r\nbreathing. During the night he passed no water, nor felt a desire to do\r\nso. About half an hour after he had taken the medicine, he began to\r\nvomit violently, which relieved him much; he then fell asleep.\r\n\r\nDose No. 3, equal as before to 1·6 mgrm., he took in the morning. He\r\nexperienced almost exactly the same symptoms as before, but convulsions\r\nwere added, especially of the face; the eyes were also prominent; twenty\r\nminutes after he had taken the dose, vomiting came on, after which he\r\nagain felt better.\r\n\r\nHe took dose No. 4, and had the same repetition of symptoms, but in the\r\ninterval between the doses he felt weaker and weaker; he had no energy,\r\nand felt as if paralysed. No. 5 was taken, and produced, like the\r\nothers, vomiting, after which he felt relieved. Neither he nor his wife\r\nseemed all this time to have had any suspicion that the medicine was\r\nreally doing harm, but thought that the effects were due to its constant\r\nrejection by vomiting, so, in order to prevent vomiting with No. 6, he\r\ndrank much cold water. After thus taking the medicine, the patient\r\nseemed to fall into a kind of slumber, with great restlessness; about an\r\nhour and a half afterwards he cried, “I am chilled; my heart, my heart\r\nis terribly cold. I am dying; I am poisoned.” His whole body was covered\r\nwith perspiration; he was now convulsed, and lost sight and hearing; his\r\neyes were shut, his lips cracked and dry, he could scarcely open his\r\nmouth, and he was extremely cold, and thought he was dying. The\r\nbreathing was difficult and rattling; from time to time the muscular\r\nspasms came on. His wife now made a large quantity of hot strong black\r\ntea, which she got him to drink with great difficulty; although it was\r\nhot, he did not know whether it was hot or cold. About five minutes\r\nafterwards he vomited, and did so several times; this apparently\r\nrelieved him, and he sank into a quiet sleep; during the night he did\r\nnot urinate. In the morning the wife went to Dr. Carl Meyer, described\r\nthe symptoms, and accused the medicine. So convinced was Dr. Meyer that\r\nthe medicine did not cause the symptoms, that he poured out a quantity\r\nof the same, equal to 4 mgrms. of aconitine nitrate, and took it himself\r\nin some wine, to show that it was harmless, and ordered them to go on\r\nwith it. The unhappy physician died of aconitine poisoning five hours\r\nafter taking the medicine.[480] In the meantime, the woman went home,\r\nand her husband actually took a seventh, but smaller dose, which\r\nproduced similar symptoms to the former, but of little severity; no more\r\nwas taken.\r\n\r\n[480] The symptoms suffered by Dr. Meyer are to be found in _Neder.\r\nTijdschrift van Geneeskunde_, 1880, No. 16.\r\n\r\nThe absence of diarrhœa, and of the pricking sensations so often\r\ndescribed, is in this case noteworthy. Both diarrhœa and formication\r\nwere also absent in a third case reported by Dr. Busscher in the same\r\npaper.\r\n\r\n§ 436. The most important criminal case is undoubtedly that of\r\nLamson:--At the Central Criminal Court, in March, 1882, George Henry\r\nLamson, surgeon, was convicted of the murder of his brother-in-law,\r\nPercy Malcolm John. The victim was a weakly youth of eighteen years of\r\nage, paralysed in his lower limbs from old standing spinal disease. The\r\nmotive for perpetrating the crime was that Lamson, through his wife\r\n(Malcolm John’s sister), would receive, on the death of his\r\nbrother-in-law, a sum of £1500, and, according to the evidence, it is\r\nprobable that there had been one or more previous attempts by Lamson on\r\nthe life of the youth with aconitine given in pills and in powders.\r\nHowever this may be, on November 24, 1880, Lamson purchased 2 grains of\r\naconitine, came down on Dec. 3 to the school where the lad was placed,\r\nhad an interview with his brother-in-law, and, in the presence of the\r\nhead-master, gave Malcolm John a capsule, which he filled then and there\r\nwith some white powder, presumed at the time to be sugar. Lamson only\r\nstayed altogether twenty minutes in the house, and directly after he saw\r\nhis brother-in-law swallow the capsule, he left. Within fifteen minutes\r\nMalcolm John became unwell, saying that he felt as if he had an attack\r\nof heart-burn, and then that he felt the same as when his brother-in-law\r\nhad on a former occasion given him a quinine pill. Violent vomiting soon\r\nset in, and he complained of pains in his stomach, a sense of\r\nconstriction in his throat, and of being unable to swallow. He was very\r\nrestless--so much so that he had to be restrained by force from injuring\r\nhimself. There was delirium a few minutes before death, which took place\r\nabout three hours and three-quarters after swallowing the fatal dose.\r\nThe _post-mortem_ appearances essentially consisted of redness of the\r\ngreater curvature of the stomach, and the posterior portion of the same\r\norgan. In one part there was a little pit, as if a blister had broken;\r\nthe rest of the viscera were congested, and the brain also slightly\r\ncongested.[481]\r\n\r\n[481] To these cases of poisoning by the alkaloid aconitine may be added\r\none recorded in Bouchardat’s _Annuaire de Thérapeutie_, 1881, p. 276.\r\nThe case in itself is of but little importance, save to illustrate the\r\ngreat danger in permitting the dispensing of such active remedies of\r\nvarying strength. A gentleman suffering from “angina pectoris” was\r\nprescribed “Hottot’s aconitine” in granules, and directed carefully to\r\nincrease the dose up to four granules, according to the effect produced.\r\nThe prescription was taken to a pharmacist, who, instead of supplying\r\nHottot’s aconitine, supplied some other of unknown origin. The medicine\r\nwas taken daily, and the dose raised to four granules, which were taken\r\nwith benefit until the whole was exhausted. He then went to Hottot’s\r\nestablishment, and had a fresh supply, presumably of the same substance,\r\nbut a very little time after he had taken his usual dose of four\r\ngranules, he suffered from symptoms of aconitine poisoning, headache,\r\nvertigo, feebleness of the voice, and muscular weakness, and was\r\nalarmingly ill. He recovered after some hours of medical treatment.\r\n\r\n§ 437. The symptoms of poisoning by the tincture, extract, or other\r\npreparation, do not differ from those detailed. As unusual effects,\r\noccasionally seen, may be noted profound unconsciousness lasting for\r\ntwo hours (Topham’s case), violent twitching of the muscles of the\r\nface, opisthotonos, and violent convulsions. It is important to\r\ndistinguish the symptoms which are not constant from those which are\r\nconstant, or nearly so. The tingling and creeping sensations about the\r\ntongue, throat, lips, &c., are not constant; they certainly were not\r\npresent in the remarkable German case cited at p. 363. Speaking\r\ngenerally, they seem more likely to occur after taking the root or the\r\nordinary medicinal preparations. A dilated state of the pupil is by no\r\nmeans constant, and not to be relied upon. Diarrhœa is seen after taking\r\nthe root or tincture by the stomach, but is often absent. In short, the\r\nonly constant symptoms are difficulty of breathing, progressive muscular\r\nweakness, generally vomiting, and a weak intermittent pulse.\r\n\r\n§ 438. =Physiological Action.=--Aconitine, according to Dr. S. Ringer,\r\nis a protoplasmic poison, destroying the functions of all nitrogenous\r\ntissue--first of the central nervous system, next of the nerves, and\r\nlast of the muscles. Aconitine without doubt acts powerfully on the\r\nheart, ultimately paralysing it; there is first a slowing of the pulse,\r\nascribed to a central excitation of the vagus; then a quickening, due to\r\nparalysis of the peripheral termination of the vagus in the heart;\r\nlastly, the heart’s action becomes slow, irregular, and weak, and the\r\nblood-pressure sinks. The dyspnœa and convulsions are the usual result,\r\nseen among all warm-blooded animals, of the heart affection. Plugge\r\nfound that the motor nerves, and more especially their intra-muscular\r\nterminations, were always paralysed; but if the dose was small the\r\nparalysis might be incomplete. Bœhm and Wartmann, on the other hand,\r\nconsidered that the motor paralysis had a central origin, a view not\r\nsupported by recent research. The action of aconitine in this way\r\nresembles curare. The muscles themselves preserve their irritability,\r\neven after doses of aconitine which are five to ten times larger than\r\nthose by which the nerve terminations are paralysed.\r\n\r\n§ 439. =Post-mortem Appearances.=--Among animals (mammals) the\r\nappearances most constantly observed have been hyperæmia of the cerebral\r\nmembranes and brain, a fulness of the large veins, the blood generally\r\nfluid--sometimes hyperæmia of the liver, sometimes not. When aconitine\r\nhas been administered subcutaneously, there have been no inflammatory\r\nappearances in the stomach and bowels.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Dr. Carl Meyer, who died in five hours from swallowing 4\r\nmgrms. of aconitine nitrate, the corpse was of a marble paleness, the\r\npupils moderately dilated. The colour of the large intestine was pale;\r\nthe duodenum was much congested, the congestion being most intense the\r\nnearer to the stomach; the mucous membrane of the stomach itself was\r\nstrongly hyperæmic, being of an intense red colour; the spleen was\r\nenlarged, filled with much dark blood. The liver and kidneys were\r\ndeeply congested, the lungs also congested; the right ventricle of the\r\nheart was distended with blood; in the pericardium there was a quantity\r\nof bloody serum. The brain was generally blood-red; in the cerebral\r\nhemispheres there were several large circumscribed subarachnoid\r\nextravasations. The substance of the brain on section showed many red\r\nbloody points.\r\n\r\nIn a case recorded by Taylor, in which a man died in three hours from\r\neating a small quantity of aconitine root, the only morbid appearance\r\nfound was a slight reddish-brown patch on the cardiac end of the\r\nstomach, of the size of half a crown; all the other organs being\r\nhealthy.\r\n\r\n§ 440. =Separation of Aconitine from the Contents of the Stomach or the\r\nOrgans.=--It would appear certain that in all operations for the\r\nseparation of aconite alkaloids (whether from the organic matters which\r\nmake up the plant, or from those constituting animal tissues), mineral\r\nacids and a high heat should be avoided. A 1 per cent. sulphuric acid\r\ndoes not, however, hydrolyse, if acting in the cold, so that the process\r\nalready given, p. 352, may be followed.\r\n\r\nThe chemical examination in the Lamson case was entrusted to Dr.\r\nStevenson, assisted by Dr. Dupré, and was conducted on the principles\r\ndetailed. The contents of the stomach were treated with alcohol, and\r\ndigested at the ordinary temperature of the atmosphere; the contents\r\nwere already acid, so no acid in this first operation was added. The\r\nmixture stood for two days and was then filtered. The insoluble portion\r\nwas now exhausted by alcohol, faintly acidulated by tartaric acid, and\r\nwarmed to 60°; cooled and filtered, the insoluble part being washed\r\nagain with alcohol. The two portions--that is, the spirituous extract\r\nacid from acids pre-existing in the contents of the stomach, and the\r\nalcohol acidified by tartaric acid--were evaporated down separately,\r\nexhausted by absolute alcohol, the solutions filtered, evaporated, and\r\nthe residue dissolved in water. The two aqueous solutions were now\r\nmixed, and shaken up with ether, which, as the solution was acid, would\r\nnot remove any alkaloid, but might remove various impurities; the\r\nresidue, after being thus partially purified by ether, was alkalised by\r\nsodic carbonate, and the alkaloid extracted by a mixture of chloroform\r\nand ether. On evaporation of the chloroform and ether, the resulting\r\nextract was tested physiologically by tasting, and also by injections\r\ninto mice. By means analogous to those detailed, the experts isolated\r\naconitine from the vomit, the stomach, liver, spleen, and urine, and\r\nalso a minute quantity of morphine, which had been administered to the\r\npatient to subdue the pain during his fatal attack. When tasted, the\r\npeculiar numbing, tingling sensation lasted many hours. These extracts\r\nwere relied upon as evidence, for their physiological effect was\r\nidentical with that produced by aconitine. For example, the extract\r\nobtained from the urine caused symptoms to commence in a mouse in two\r\nminutes, and death in thirty minutes, and the symptoms observed by\r\ninjecting a mouse with known aconitine coincided in every particular\r\nwith the symptoms produced by the extraction from the urine.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the manner of using “_life tests_,” since in most cases\r\nextremely small quantities of the active principle will have to be\r\nidentified, the choice is limited to small animals, and it is better to\r\nuse mice or birds, rather than reptiles. In the Lamson case,\r\nsubcutaneous injections were employed, but it is a question whether\r\nthere is not less error in administering it by the mouth. If two healthy\r\nmice are taken, and the one fed with a little meal, to which a weighed\r\nquantity of the extract under experiment has been added, while to the\r\nother some meal mixed with a supposed equal dose of aconitine is given,\r\nthen the symptoms may be compared; and several objections to any\r\noperative proceeding on such small animals are obviated. It is certain\r\nthat any extract which causes distinct numbness of the lips will contain\r\nenough of the poison to kill a small bird or a mouse, if administered in\r\nthe ordinary way.[482]\r\n\r\n[482] Dr. A. Langaard has described a species of aconite root, named by\r\nthe Japanese _Kŭsa-ūsū_. From his experiments on frogs and rabbits, its\r\nphysiological action seems not to differ from that of aconitine\r\ngenerally.--_Ueber eine Art Japanische Akonit-knollen, Kŭsa-ūsū genannt,\r\nu. über das in denselben vorkommende Akonitin.

ATROPINE.\r\n\r\n§ 441. =Atropine= (=Daturine=), C₁₇H₂₃NO₃.--This important alkaloid has\r\nbeen found in all parts of the _Atropa belladonna_, or deadly\r\nnightshade, and in all the species of _Datura_.\r\n\r\nThe _Atropa belladonna_ is indigenous, and may be found in some parts of\r\nEngland, although it cannot be said to be very common. It belongs to the\r\n_Solanaceæ_, and is a herbaceous plant with broadly ovate entire leaves,\r\nand lurid-purple axillary flowers on short stalks; the berries are\r\nviolet-black, and the whole of the plant is highly poisonous. The juice\r\nof the leaves stains paper a purple colour. The seeds are very small,\r\nkidney-shaped, weighing about 90 to the grain; they are covered closely\r\nwith small, round projections, and are easily identified by an expert,\r\nwho may be supposed to have at hand (as is most essential) samples of\r\ndifferent poisonous seeds for comparison. The nightshade owes its\r\npoisonous properties to _atropine_.\r\n\r\nThe yield of the different parts of belladonna, according to\r\nGunther,[483] is as follows:--\r\n\r\n[483] _Pharm. Zeitschr. f.

Chem. Ges._, Bd. 13.\r\n\r\nFrom a research by W. Schütte,[485] it appears that the younger roots of\r\nwild belladonna contain hyoscyamine only, whilst the older roots contain\r\natropine as well as hyoscyamine, but only in small proportion; the same\r\nwas observed to be the case in the older cultivated roots.\r\n\r\n[485] _Arch. Pharm._, ccxxix., 492-531; _Journ. Chem. Soc._ (abstract),\r\nFebruary 1892, 231.\r\n\r\nThe ripe berries of cultivated _Atropa belladonna nigra_ contain\r\natropine and hyoscyamine; those of the wild plant contain atropine only;\r\nthe ripe fruit of _Atropa belladonna lutea_ contains only atropine and\r\nanother base, perhaps identical with atropamine; the unripe fruit of\r\nwild _Atropa belladonna nigra_ contains hyoscyamine, with only a small\r\nquantity of atropine.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of the yellow and black-fruited wild _Atropa belladonna_\r\ncontain hyoscyamine and atropine, the latter being in small quantity\r\nonly.\r\n\r\nFresh and old seeds of _Datura Stramonium_ contain chiefly hyoscyamine;\r\nsmall quantities of atropine and scopolamine are also present.\r\n\r\n§ 442. =The Datura Stramonium or Thorn-apple= is also indigenous in the\r\nBritish Islands, but, like belladonna, it cannot be considered a common\r\nplant. Datura belongs to the Solanaceæ; it grows from 1 to 2 feet in\r\nheight, and is found in waste places. The leaves are smooth, the flowers\r\nwhite; the fruit is densely spinous (hence the name thorn-apple), and is\r\ndivided into four dissepiments below, two at the top, and containing\r\nmany seeds.\r\n\r\nThe _Datura_, or the _Dhatura_-plants, of India have in that country a\r\ngreat toxicological significance, the white-flowered datura, or _Datura\r\nalba_, growing plentifully in waste places, especially about Madras. The\r\npurple-coloured variety, or _Datura fastuosa_, is also common in certain\r\nparts. There is a third variety, the _Datura atrox_, found about the\r\ncoast of Malabar. The seeds of the white datura have been mistaken in\r\nIndia for those of capsicum. The following are some of the most marked\r\ndifferences:--\r\n\r\n  SEEDS OF THE COMMON OR WHITE        SEEDS OF CAPSICUM.\r\n  DATURA.\r\n\r\n  (1.) Outline angular.

There is also a\r\ntincture which contains about 0·06 per cent. of alkaloid.\r\n\r\n§ 444. =Properties of Atropine=, C₁₇H₂₃NO₃.--Atropine, hyoscyamine, and\r\nhyoscine have all the same formula, but differ in their molecular\r\nconstitution. Atropine by hydrolysis, either by heating it with\r\nhydrochloric acid or baryta water, is decomposed into tropine and tropic\r\nacid:--\r\n\r\n  C₁₇H₂₃NO₃ + H₂O = C₈H₁₅NO + C₉H₁₀O₃.\r\n  Atropine.      Tropine. Tropic\r\n                           acid.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, by heating tropic acid and tropine together,\r\natropine is regenerated. Hence it is proved by analysis and\r\nsynthesis, that atropine is tropic acid-tropine, just as aconitine is\r\nbenzoyl-aconine. Tropic acid has been produced synthetically by\r\nboiling β-chlorphenyl-propionic acid with potash, which at once shows\r\nits constitutional formula, viz.:--\r\n\r\n        CH₂OH\r\n       /\r\n  C₆H₅CH      .\r\n       \\\r\n        COOH\r\n\r\nTropic acid has a melting-point of 117° to 118°. Tropine is a four-fold\r\nhydrated oxethyl-methyl-pyridine, and has the constitutional formula of\r\nC₅H₃(H₄)(C₂H₄OH)N(CH₃); hence the constitutional formula of atropine\r\nis--\r\n\r\n          CH₂(OH)\r\n         /\r\n  C₆H₅--CH                       .\r\n         \\\r\n          CO--O(C₂H₄--C₅H₇==N--CH₃)\r\n\r\nTropine is a white, crystalline, strongly alkaline mass, melting at 60°,\r\nand volatilising at 230° undecomposed. It is soluble in water, alcohol,\r\nand ether, and gives precipitates with tannic acid, iodised hydriodic\r\nacid, Mayer’s reagent, gold chloride, and mercuric chloride. Tropine\r\ngold chloride melts at 210° to 212°. Atropic acid (C₉H₈O₂),\r\nmelting-point 198° to 200°, and isatropic acid (C₉H₈O₂), may also be\r\nobtained by the action of hydrochloric acid--the first, in radiating\r\ncrystals, melting at 106°, and capable of distillation; the second, in\r\nthin rhombic plates, melting about 200°, and not volatile. Picric acid\r\nalso gives a precipitate of beautiful plates. To obtain this the\r\ncarbazotic acid must be in excess, and time must be given for the\r\nprecipitate to form.\r\n\r\nAtropine forms colourless crystals (mostly in groups or tufts of needles\r\nand prisms), which are heavier than water, and possess no smell, but an\r\nunpleasant, long-enduring, bitter taste. The experiments of E. Schmidt\r\nplace the melting-point between 115° and 115·5°. It is said to sublime\r\nscantily in a crystalline form, but the writer has been unable to obtain\r\nany crystals by sublimation; faint mists collect on the upper disc, at\r\nabout 123°, but they are perfectly amorphous.\r\n\r\nIts reaction is alkaline; one part requires, of cold water, 300; of\r\nboiling, 58; of ether, 30; of benzene, 40; and of chloroform, 3 parts\r\nfor solution. In alcohol and amyl alcohol it dissolves in almost every\r\nproportion. It turns the plane of polarisation weakly to the left.\r\n\r\n§ 445. =Tests.=--Atropine mixed with nitric acid exhibits no change of\r\ncolour. The same is the case with concentrated sulphuric acid in the\r\ncold; but on heating, there ensues the common browning, with development\r\nof a peculiar odour, likened by Gulielmo to orange flowers, by\r\nDragendorff to the flowers of the _Prunus padus_, and by Otto to the\r\n_Spiræa ulmaria_--a sufficient evidence of the untrustworthiness of this\r\nas a distinctive test. The odour, indeed, with small quantities, is\r\ncertainly not powerful, nor is it strongly suggestive of any of the\r\nplants mentioned. A far more intense odour is given off if a speck of\r\natropine is evaporated to dryness with a few drops of strong solution of\r\nbaryta, and heated strongly; the scent is decidedly analogous to that of\r\nhawthorn-blossom, and unmistakably agreeable.\r\n\r\nBy boiling a small quantity of atropine, say 1 mgrm., with 2 mgrms. of\r\ncalomel and a very little water, the calomel blackens, and crystals may\r\nbe obtained of a double salt; this reaction is, however, given also by\r\nhyoscyamine and homatropine. Mercuric potassium iodide solution, and\r\nmercuric bromide solution give amorphous precipitates, which, after a\r\ntime, become crystalline, and have characteristic forms.\r\n\r\nA solution of iodine in potassium iodide gives a precipitate with\r\nacidulated solutions of atropine in even a dilution of 1 : 10,000.\r\nTannin precipitates, and the precipitate is soluble in excess of the\r\nreagent. If atropine be dissolved in dilute hydrochloric acid, and a 5\r\nper cent. of gold chloride solution be added, a precipitate of a gold\r\ncompound (C₁₇H₂₃NO₃HClAuCl₃) separates. The precipitate is in the form\r\nof rosettes or needles; melting-point 137°. On boiling it with water,\r\nhowever, it melts into oily drops, and this peculiar behaviour\r\ndistinguishes it from the analogous salt of hyoscyamine, which does not\r\nmelt in boiling water. The percentage of gold left on a combustion of\r\natropine gold chloride is 31·35 per cent. 100 parts of the gold salt are\r\nequal to 46·2 of atropine. A platinum salt may also be obtained,\r\n(C₁₇H₂₃NO₃HCl)₂,PtCl₄, containing 29·5 per cent. of platinum.\r\n\r\nVitali’s test is important; it consists in the production of a violet\r\ncolour with alcoholic potash after oxidation.\r\n\r\nThe test may be applied as follows:--Equal parts, say 1 mgrm., of\r\nnitrate of sodium and of the substance to be tested, are rubbed together\r\nwith a glass rod on a porcelain slab, and to this mixture 1 drop of\r\nsulphuric acid is added; the mixture is spread out in a thin film; upon\r\nthis is strewn a little powdered potassium hydrate, and finally 1 drop\r\nof alcohol added; a violet colour is produced which passes into a fine\r\nred; according to the author of the test, 0·001 mgrm. of atropine\r\nsulphate can by this test be detected. Strychnine obscures this\r\nreaction.\r\n\r\nAtropine, homatropine, and hyoscyamine show an alkaline reaction with\r\nphenolphthalein: atropine and homatropine give a precipitate with HgCl₂.\r\nHyoscyamine, not cocaine, precipitates HgCl₂, and is alkaline to litmus,\r\nbut not to phenolphthalein. Atropine behaves as follows:--(1) Sodium\r\nnitrate, sulphuric acid, and afterwards sodium hydroxide, gives a violet\r\ncolour; (2) the test as before, but with nitrite instead of nitrate,\r\ngives orange colour, which, on dilution with sodium hydroxide solution,\r\nchanges to red, violet, or lilac; (3) when heated with glacial acetic\r\nacid and sulphuric acid for a sufficient time, a greenish-yellow\r\nfluorescence is produced.--_Flückiger, Pharm. Journ. Trans._ (3), vol.\r\nxvi. p. 601-602.\r\n\r\nThe two alkaloids, strychnine and atropine, are not likely to be often\r\ntogether in the human body, but that it may sometimes occur is shown by\r\na case recorded by L. Fabris.[488] A patient in the hospital at Padua\r\nhad for some time been treated with daily injections of 3 mgrms. of\r\nstrychnine nitrate; unfortunately, one day, instead of the 3 mgrms. of\r\nstrychnine, the same quantity of atropine sulphate was injected, and the\r\npatient died after a few hours, with symptoms of atropine poisoning.\r\n\r\n[488] _Gazzetta_, xxii., i. 347-350.\r\n\r\nOn chemical treatment of the viscera, a mixture of alkaloids was\r\nobtained which did not give either the reactions of strychnine or of\r\natropine. To test the possibility of these alkaloids obscuring each\r\nother’s reactions, mixtures of 3 per cent. solutions (the strength of\r\nthe injections) of atropine sulphate and strychnine nitrate were mixed\r\ntogether, and strychnine tested for by the dichromate and sulphuric acid\r\ntest.\r\n\r\nA mixture of equal parts gave the strychnine reaction very clearly, but\r\nthe atropine reaction not at all; 1 strychnine with 3 of atropine gave\r\nstrychnine reaction, but not that of atropine; 1 strychnine with 4\r\natropine gave indistinct reaction for both alkaloids; 1 of strychnine\r\nwith 5 of atropine gave a momentary atropine reaction, the violet was,\r\nhowever, almost immediately replaced by a red colour. Vitali’s reaction\r\nwas not clearly shown until the mixture was in the proportion of 9 of\r\natropine to 1 of strychnine, but mixtures in the proportion of 3\r\nstrychnine and 1 atropine will give distinct mydriasis.\r\n\r\nIn such a case, of course, the strychnine should be separated from the\r\natropine; this can be effected by precipitating the strychnine as\r\nchromate, filtering and recovering from the filter the atropine by\r\nalkalising and shaking it out with ether.\r\n\r\nThe atropine may be farther purified by converting it into oxalate,\r\ndissolving the oxalate in as small a quantity of alcohol as possible,\r\nand precipitating the oxalate out with ether; the precipitate is\r\ncollected, dissolved in as small a quantity of water as possible, the\r\nwater made alkaline, and the base shaken out with ether.\r\n\r\nThe most reliable test for atropine, or one of the mydriatic alkaloids,\r\nis its action on the iris; a solution of atropine, even so weak as 1 :\r\n130,000, causing dilatation.[489] This action on the iris has been\r\nstudied by Ruyter,[490] Donders, and von Graefe.\r\n\r\n[489] _De Actione Atropæ Belladonnæ in Iridem_, Traj. ad Rhen., 1852.\r\n\r\n[490] _Arch. Ophthal._, ix. 262, 1864.\r\n\r\nThe action is local, taking effect when in dilute solution only on the\r\neye to which it has been applied; and it has been produced on the eyes\r\nof frogs, not only in the living subject, but after the head has been\r\nsevered from the body and deprived of brain. The thinner the cornea, the\r\nquicker the dilatation; therefore, the younger the person or animal, the\r\nmore suitable for experiment. In frogs, with a solution of 1 : 250,\r\ndilatation commences in about five minutes; in pigeons, seven minutes;\r\nand in rabbits, ten minutes. In man, a solution of 1 : 120 commences to\r\nact in about six to seven minutes, reaches its highest point in from ten\r\nto fifteen minutes, and persists more or less for six to eight days. A\r\nsolution of 1 : 480 acts first in fifteen to twenty minutes, and reaches\r\nits greatest point in twenty minutes; a solution of 1 : 48,000 requires\r\nfrom three-quarters of an hour to an hour to show its effect. Dogs and\r\ncats are far more sensible to its influence than man, and therefore more\r\nsuitable for experiment. If the expert chooses, he may essay the proof\r\nupon himself, controlling the dilatation by Calabar bean; but it is\r\nseldom necessary or advisable to make personal trials of this\r\nnature.[491]\r\n\r\n[491] A. Ladenburg (_Compt. Rend._, xc. 92), having succeeded in\r\nreproducing atropine by heating tropine and tropic acid with\r\nhydrochloric acid, by substituting various organic acids for the tropic\r\nacid, has obtained a whole series of compounds to which he has given the\r\nname of _tropeines_. One of these, hydroxytoluol (amygdalic) tropeine,\r\nhe has named _homatropine_. It dilates the pupil, but is less poisonous\r\nthan atropine.\r\n\r\n§ 446. =Statistics of Atropine Poisoning.=--Since atropine is the active\r\nprinciple of belladonna and datura plants, and every portion of\r\nthese--root, seeds, leaves, and fruit--has caused toxic symptoms,\r\npoisoning by any part of these plants, or by their pharmaceutical or\r\nother preparations, may be considered with strict propriety as atropine\r\npoisoning. Our English death statistics for the ten years ending 1892,\r\nrecord 79 deaths (50 males and 29 females) from atropine (for the most\r\npart registered under the head of belladonna); 29 (or 36·7 per cent.)\r\nwere suicidal, the rest accidental.\r\n\r\nThe greatest number of the accidental cases arise from mistakes in\r\npharmacy; thus, belladonna leaves have been supplied for ash leaves; the\r\nextract of belladonna has been given instead of extract of juniper; the\r\nalkaloid itself has been dispensed in mistake for theine;[492] a more\r\ncurious and marvellously stupid mistake is one in which it was dispensed\r\ninstead of assafœtida (Schauenstein, _op. cit._, p. 652). Further,\r\nvalerianate of atropine has been accidentally substituted for quinine\r\nvalerianate, and Schauenstein relates a case in which atropine sulphate\r\nwas administered subcutaneously instead of morphine sulphate; but the\r\nresult was not lethal. Many other instances might be cited. The extended\r\nuse of atropine as an external application to the eye naturally gives\r\nrise to a few direct and indirect accidents. Serious symptoms have\r\narisen from the solution reaching the pharynx through the lachrymal duct\r\nand nose. A curious indirect poisoning, caused by the use of atropine as\r\na collyrium, is related by Schauenstein.[493] A person suffered from all\r\nthe symptoms of atropine poisoning; but the channel by which it had\r\nobtained access to the system was a great mystery, until it was traced\r\nto some coffee, and it was then found that the cook had strained this\r\ncoffee through a certain piece of linen, which had been used months\r\nbefore, soaked in atropine solution, as a collyrium, and had been cast\r\naside as of no value.\r\n\r\n[492] Hohl, _De Effectu Atropini. Diss. Halle_, 1863.\r\n\r\n[493] Maschka’s _Handbuch_.\r\n\r\n§ 447. =Accidental and Criminal Poisoning by Atropine.=--External\r\napplications of atropine are rapidly absorbed, _e.g._, if the foot of a\r\nrat be steeped for a little while in a solution of the alkaloid, and the\r\neyes watched, dilatation of the pupils will soon be observed. If the\r\nskin is broken, enough may be absorbed to cause death. A case is on\r\nrecord in which ·21 grm. of atropine sulphate, applied as an ointment to\r\nthe abraded skin, was fatal.[494] Atropine has also been absorbed from\r\nthe bowel; in one case, a clyster containing the active principles of\r\n5·2 grms. (80 grains) of belladonna root was administered to a woman\r\ntwenty-seven years of age, and caused death. Allowing the root to have\r\nbeen carefully dried, and to contain ·21 per cent. of alkaloid, it would\r\nseem that so little as 10·9 mgrms. (·16 grain) may even prove fatal, if\r\nleft in contact with the intestinal mucous membrane. Belladonna berries\r\nand stramonium leaves and seeds are eaten occasionally by children. A\r\nremarkable series of poisonings by belladonna berries occurred in London\r\nduring the autumn of 1846.\r\n\r\n[494] Ploss, _Zeitschr. f. Chir._, 1863.\r\n\r\nCriminal poisoning by atropine in any form is of excessive rarity in\r\nEurope and America, but in India it has been frightfully prevalent. In\r\nall the Asiatic cases the substance used has been one of the various\r\nspecies of datura, and mostly the bruised or ground seeds, or a\r\ndecoction of the seeds. In 120 cases recorded in papers and works on\r\nIndian toxicology, I find no less than 63 per cent. of the cases\r\ncriminal, 19 per cent. suicidal, and 18 per cent. accidental. In noting\r\nthese figures, however, it must be borne in mind that known criminal\r\ncases are more certain to be recorded than any other cases. The drug has\r\nbeen known under the Sanscrit name of _dhatoora_ by the Hindoos from\r\nmost remote times. It was largely used by the Thugs, either for the\r\npurpose of stupefying their victim or for killing him; by loose wives to\r\nensure for a time the fatuity of their husbands; and, lastly, it seems\r\nin Indian history to have played the peculiar _rôle_ of a state agent,\r\nand to have been used to induce the idiocy or insanity of persons of\r\nhigh rank, whose mental integrity was considered dangerous by the despot\r\nin power. The Hindoos, by centuries of practice, have attained such\r\ndexterity in the use of the “datura” as to raise that kind of poisoning\r\nto an art, so that Dr. Chevers, in his _Medical Jurisprudence for\r\nIndia_,[495] declares that “there appears to be no drug known in the\r\npresent day which represents in its effects so close an approach to the\r\nsystem of slow poisoning, believed by many to have been practised in the\r\nMiddle Ages, as does the datura.”\r\n\r\n[495] Dr. Chevers’s work contains a very good history of datura criminal\r\npoisoning.\r\n\r\n§ 448. =Fatal Dose.=--It is impossible to state with precision the exact\r\nquantity which may cause death, atropine being one of those substances\r\nwhose effect, varying in different cases, seems to depend on special\r\nconstitutional tendencies or idiosyncracies of the individual. Some\r\npersons take a comparatively large amount with impunity, while others\r\nscarcely bear a very moderate dose without exhibiting unpleasant\r\nsymptoms. Eight mgrms. (⅛ grain) have been known to produce poisonous\r\nsymptoms, and ·129 grm. (2 grains) death. We may, therefore, infer that\r\nabout ·0648 grm. (1 grain) would, unchecked by remedies, probably act\r\nfatally; but very large doses have been recovered from, especially when\r\ntreatment has been prompt.\r\n\r\nAtropine is used in veterinary practice, from 32·4 to 64·8 mgrms. (½ to\r\n1 grain) and more being administered subcutaneously to horses; but the\r\nextent to which this may be done with safety is not yet established.\r\n\r\n§ 449. =Action on Animals.=--The action of atropine has been studied on\r\ncertain beetles, on reptiles (such as the salamander, triton, frogs, and\r\nothers), on guinea-pigs, hedgehogs, rats, rabbits, fowls, pigeons, dogs,\r\nand cats. Among the mammalia there is no essential difference in the\r\nsymptoms, but great variation in the relative sensibility; man seems the\r\nmost sensitive of all, next to man come the carnivora, while the\r\nherbivora, and especially the rodents, offer a considerable resistance.\r\nAccording to Falck the lethal dose for a rabbit is at least ·79 mgrm.\r\nper kilo. It is the general opinion that rabbits may eat sufficient of\r\nthe belladonna plant to render their flesh poisonous, and yet the\r\nanimals themselves may show no disturbance in health; but this must not\r\nbe considered adequately established. Speaking very generally, the\r\nhigher the animal organisation the greater the sensibility to atropine.\r\nFrogs are affected in a peculiar manner. According to the researches of\r\nFraser,[496] the animal is first paralysed, and some hours after the\r\nadministration of the poison lies motionless, the only signs of life\r\nbeing the existence of a slight movement of the heart and muscular\r\nirritability. After a period of from forty-eight to seventy-two hours,\r\nthe fore limbs are seized with tetanic spasms, which develop into a\r\nstrychnine-like tetanus.\r\n\r\n[496] _Transact. of Edin. Roy. Soc._, vol. xxv. p. 449. _Journ. of Anat.\r\nand Physiol._, May 1869, p. 357.\r\n\r\n§ 450. =Action on Man.=--When atropine is injected subcutaneously, the\r\nsymptoms, as is usually the case with drugs administered in this manner,\r\nmay come on immediately, the pupil not unfrequently dilating almost\r\nbefore the injection is finished. This is in no way surprising; but\r\nthere are instances in which decoctions of datura seeds have been\r\nadministered by the stomach, and the commencement of symptoms has been\r\nas rapid as in poisoning by oxalic or even prussic acid. In a case tried\r\nin India in July 1852, the prosecutor declared that, while a person was\r\nhanding him a _lota_ of water, the prisoner snatched it away on pretence\r\nof freeing the water from dirt or straws, and then gave it to him. He\r\nthen drank only two mouthfuls, and, complaining of the bitter taste,\r\nfell down insensible within forty yards of the spot where he had drunk,\r\nand did not recover his senses until the third day after. In another\r\ncase, a man was struck down so suddenly that his feet were scalded by\r\nsome hot water which he was carrying.--_Chevers._\r\n\r\nWhen the seeds, leaves, or fruit of atropine-holding plants are eaten,\r\nthere is, however, a very appreciable period before the symptoms\r\ncommence, and, as in the case of opium poisoning, no very definite rule\r\ncan be laid down, but usually the effects are experienced within half\r\nan hour. The first sensation is dryness of the mouth and throat; this\r\ncontinues increasing, and may rise to such a degree that the swallowing\r\nof liquids is an impossibility. The difficulty in swallowing does not\r\nseem to be entirely dependent on the dry state of the throat, but is\r\nalso due to a spasmodic contraction of the pharyngeal muscles.\r\nTissore[497] found in one case such constriction that he could only\r\nintroduce emetics by passing a catheter of small diameter. The mucous\r\nmembrane is reddened, and the voice hoarse.[498] The inability to\r\nswallow, and the changed voice, bear some little resemblance to\r\nhydrophobia--a resemblance heightened to the popular mind by an\r\ninclination to bite, which seems to have been occasionally observed; the\r\npupils are early dilated, and the dilatation may be marked and extreme;\r\nthe vision is deranged, letters and figures often appear duplicated; the\r\neyeballs are occasionally remarkably prominent, and generally congested;\r\nthe skin is dry, even very small quantities of atropine arresting the\r\ncutaneous secretion; in this respect atropine and pilocarpine are\r\nperfect examples of antagonism. With the dryness of skin, in a large\r\npercentage of cases, occurs a scarlet rash over most of the body. This\r\nis generally the case after large doses, but Stadler saw the rash\r\nproduced on a child three months old by ·3 mgrm. of atropine sulphate.\r\nIt appeared three minutes after the dose, lasted five hours, and was\r\nreproduced by a renewed dose.[499] The temperature of the body with\r\nlarge doses is raised; with small, somewhat lowered. The pulse is\r\nincreased in frequency, and is always above 100--mostly from 115 to 120,\r\nor even 150, in the minute. The breathing is at first a little slowed,\r\nand then very rapid. Vomiting is not common; the sphincters may be\r\nparalysed so that the evacuations are involuntary, and there may be also\r\nspasmodic contractions of the urinary bladder. The nervous system is\r\nprofoundly affected; in one case there were clonic spasms,[500] in\r\nanother,[501] such muscular rigidity, that the patient could with\r\ndifficulty be placed on a chair. The lower extremities are often partly\r\nparalysed, there is a want of co-ordination, the person reels like a\r\ndrunken man, or there may be general jactitation. The disturbance of\r\nthe brain functions is very marked; in about 4 per cent. only of the\r\nrecorded cases has there been no delirium, or very little--in the\r\nmajority delirium is present. In adults this generally takes a\r\ngarrulous, pleasing form, but every variety has been witnessed. Dr. H.\r\nGiraud describes the delirium from datura (which it may be necessary to\r\nagain repeat is _atropine_ delirium) as follows:--“He either vociferates\r\nloudly or is garrulous, and talks incoherently; sometimes he is\r\nmirthful, and laughs wildly, or is sad and moans, as if in great\r\ndistress; generally he is observed to be very timid, and, when most\r\ntroublesome and unruly, can always be cowed by an angry word, frequently\r\nputting up his hands in a supplicating posture. When approached he\r\nsuddenly shrinks back as if apprehensive of being struck, and frequently\r\nhe moves about as if to avoid spectra. But the most invariable\r\naccompaniment of the final stage of delirium, and frequently also that\r\nof _sopor_, is in the incessant picking at real or imaginary objects. At\r\none time the patient seizes hold of parts of his clothes or bedding,\r\npulls at his fingers and toes, takes up dirt and stones from the ground,\r\nor as often snatches at imaginary objects in the air, on his body, or\r\nanything near him. Very frequently he appears as if amusing himself by\r\ndrawing out imaginary threads from the ends of his fingers, and\r\noccasionally his antics are so varied and ridiculous, that I have seen\r\nhis near relatives, although apprehensive of danger, unable to restrain\r\ntheir laughter.”[502] This active delirium passes into a somnolent state\r\nwith muttering, catching at the bedclothes, or at floating spectra, and\r\nin fatal cases the patient dies in this stage. As a rule, the sleep is\r\nnot like opium coma; there is complete insensibility in both, but in the\r\none the sleep is deep, without muttering, in the other, from atropine,\r\nit is more like the stupor of a fever. The course in fatal cases is\r\nrapid, death generally taking place within six hours. If a person live\r\nover seven or eight hours, he usually recovers, however serious the\r\nsymptoms may appear. On waking, the patient remembers nothing of his\r\nillness; mydriasis remains some time, and there may be abnormality of\r\nspeech and weakness of the limbs, but within four days health is\r\nre-established. In cases where the seeds have been swallowed, the\r\nsymptoms may be much prolonged, and they seem to continue until all the\r\nseeds have been voided--perhaps this is due to the imperfect but\r\ncontinuous extraction of atropine by the intestinal juices.\r\n\r\n[497] _Gaz. hebd._, 1856.\r\n\r\n[498] A friend of the author’s was given, by a mistake in dispensing, 16\r\nminims of a solution of atropine sulphate, equivalent to 1/7 grain of\r\natropine (or 9·3 mgrms). Ten minutes after taking the dose there was\r\ndilatation of the pupil, indistinctness of vision, with great dryness of\r\nthe throat and difficulty in swallowing; he attempted to eat a biscuit,\r\nbut, after chewing it, he was obliged to spit it out, as it was not\r\npossible to swallow; the throat was excessively sore, and there was a\r\ndesire to pass urine, but only a few drops could be voided. In\r\nforty-five minutes he was unable to stand or walk. There was a bright\r\nrash on the chest. In two hours he became insensible, and was taken to\r\nthe Middlesex Hospital, recovering under treatment in about eight hours.\r\n\r\n[499] _Med. Times_, 1868.\r\n\r\n[500] _Lancet_, vol. i., 1881, p. 414.\r\n\r\n[501] _Ibid._, vol. i., 1876, p. 346.\r\n\r\n[502] In an English case of belladonna poisoning, the patient, a tailor,\r\nsat for four hours, moving his hands and arms as if sewing, and his lips\r\nas if talking, but without uttering a word.\r\n\r\nChronic poisoning by atropine may, from what has been stated, be of\r\ngreat importance in India. It is probable that its continuous effect\r\nwould tend to weaken the intellect, and there is no reason for any\r\nincredulity with regard to its power as a factor of insanity. Rossbach\r\nhas ascertained that if dogs are, day after day, dosed with atropine,\r\nthey become emaciated; but a certain tolerance is established, and the\r\ndose has to be raised considerably after a time to produce any marked\r\nphysiological effect.\r\n\r\n§ 451. =Physiological Action of Atropine.=--From the numerous\r\nexperiments on animals which have been performed for the purpose of\r\nelucidating the action of atropine, it is clear that the terminations of\r\nthe vagus in the heart muscle are first excited, and then paralysed. The\r\nexcitor-motor ganglion is also paralysed, and finally the heart itself;\r\ndeath resulting from heart paralysis. The respiratory disturbance is\r\nalso to be ascribed to the vagus; the terminations in the lung are\r\nparalysed, and, at the same time, the poison circulating through the\r\nrespiratory nervous centre stimulates it first, and then it also becomes\r\nfinally paralysed. The small vessels are generally widened after a\r\nprevious transitory narrowing. Organs containing unstriped muscular\r\nfibre are generally paralysed, as well as the ends of the nerves\r\nregulating secretion--hence the dryness of the skin. The action on the\r\niris is not thoroughly elucidated.\r\n\r\n§ 452. The _diagnosis_ of atropine poisoning may be very difficult\r\nunless the attention of the medical man be excited by some suspicious\r\ncircumstance. A child suffering from belladonna rash, with hot dry skin,\r\nquick pulse, and reddened fauces, looks not unlike one under an attack\r\nof scarlet fever. Further, as before mentioned, some cases are similar\r\nto rabies; and again, the garrulous delirium and the hallucinations of\r\nan adult are often very similar to those of _delirium tremens_, as well\r\nas tomania.\r\n\r\n§ 453. =Post-mortem Appearances.=--The _post-mortem_ appearances do not\r\nseem to be characteristic, save in the fact that the pupils remain\r\ndilated. The brain is usually hyperæmic, and in one case the absence of\r\nmoisture seems to have been remarkable. The stomach and intestines may\r\nbe somewhat irritated if the seeds, leaves, or other parts of the plant\r\nhave been eaten; but the irritation is not constant if the poisoning has\r\nbeen by pure atropine, and still less is it likely to be present if\r\natropine has been administered subcutaneously.\r\n\r\n§ 454. =Treatment.=--The great majority of cases recover under\r\ntreatment. In 112 cases collected by F. A. Falck, 13 only were fatal\r\n(11·6 per cent.). The greater portion of the deaths in India are those\r\nof children and old people--persons of feeble vitality. The Asiatic\r\ntreatment, which has been handed down by tradition, is the application\r\nof cold water to the feet; but the method which has found most favour in\r\nEngland is treatment by pilocarpine, a fifth of a grain or more being\r\ninjected from time to time. Pilocarpine shows as perfect antagonism as\r\npossible; atropine dries, pilocarpine moistens the skin; atropine\r\naccelerates, pilocarpine slows the respiration. Dr. Sydney Ringer and\r\nothers have published a remarkable series of cases showing the efficacy\r\nof this treatment, which, of course, is to be combined where necessary\r\nwith emetics, the use of the stomach-pump, &c.[503]\r\n\r\n[503] See, for Dr. Ringer’s cases, _Lancet_, vol. i., 1876, p. 346.\r\nRefer also to _Brit. Med. Journ._, vol. i., 1881, p. 594; _ib._, p. 659.\r\n\r\n§ 455. =Separation of Atropine from Organic Tissues, &c.=--From the\r\ncontents of the stomach, atropine may be separated by acidulating\r\nstrongly with sulphuric acid (15 to 20 c.c. of dilute H₂SO₄ to 100\r\nc.c.), digesting for some time at a temperature not exceeding 70°, and\r\nthen reducing any solid matter to a pulp by friction, and filtering,\r\nwhich can generally be effected by the aid of a filter-pump. The liver,\r\nmuscles,[504] and coagulated blood, &c., may also be treated in a\r\nprecisely similar way. The acid liquid thus obtained, is first, to\r\nremove impurities, shaken up with amyl alcohol, and after the separation\r\nof the latter in the usual manner, it is agitated with chloroform, which\r\nwill take up any of the remaining amyl alcohol,[505] and also serve to\r\npurify further. The chloroform is then removed by a pipette (or the\r\nseparating flask before described), and the fluid made alkaline, and\r\nshaken up with ether, which, on removal, is allowed to evaporate\r\nspontaneously. The residue will contain atropine, and this may be\r\nfarther purified by converting it into oxalate, as suggested, page 374.\r\n\r\n[504] Neither amyl alcohol nor chloroform removes atropine from an\r\n_acid_ solution.\r\n\r\n[505] Atropine goes into the blood, and appears to be present in the\r\ndifferent organs in direct proportion to the quantity of blood they\r\ncontain. Dragendorff has found in the muscles of rabbits fed upon\r\nbelladonna sufficient atropine for quantitative estimation.\r\n\r\nFrom the urine,[506] atropine may be extracted by acidifying with\r\nsulphuric acid, and agitation with the same series of solvents. Atropine\r\nhas been separated from putrid matters long after death, nor does it\r\nappear to suffer any decomposition by the ordinary analytical operations\r\nof evaporating solutions to dryness at 100°. In other words, there seems\r\nto be no necessity for operations _in vacuo_, in attempts at separating\r\natropine.\r\n\r\n[506] Dragendorff has found atropine in the urine of rabbits fed with\r\nbelladonna; the separation by the poison is so rapid that it often can\r\nonly be recognised in the urine during the first hour after the poison\r\nhas been taken.\r\n\r\nTABLE SHOWING THE ALKALOIDAL CONTENT OF VARIOUS PARTS OF THE HENBANE\r\nPLANT.\r\n\r\n  +----------------------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n  |                            | Seeds,|Leaves,| Stalk,| Root, |\r\n  +----------+---------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n  | Plant    | Hyosc.- | 1868. |  ...  | 0·588 | 0·012 | 0·128 |\r\n  | Desti-   | Albus.  | 1869. |  ...  | 0·469 |  ...  | 0·176 |\r\n  | tute     +---------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n  | of       | Hyosc.- | 1868. |  ...  | 0·154 | 0·070 | 0·027 |\r\n  | Flowers. | Niger.  | 1869. |  ...  | 0·192 | 0·017 | 0·080 |\r\n  +----------+---------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n  |          | Hyosc.- | 1868. |  ...  | 0·359 | 0·036 | 0·146 |\r\n  | Plant    | Albus.  | 1869. |  ...  | 0·329 | 0·048 | 0·262 |\r\n  | in       +---------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n  | Flower.  | Hyosc.- | 1868. |  ...  | 0·147 | 0·032 | 0·127 |\r\n  |          | Niger.  | 1869. |  ...  | 0·206 | 0·030 | 0·138 |\r\n  +----------+---------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n  |          | Hyosc.- | 1868. | 0·162 | 0·211 | 0·027 | 0·106 |\r\n  | Plant    | Albus.  | 1869. | 0·172 | 0·153 | 0·029 | 0·086 |\r\n  | in       +---------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n  | Fruit.   | Hyosc.- | 1868. | 0·075 | 0·065 | 0·009 | 0·028 |\r\n  |          | Niger.  | 1869. | 0·118 | 0·110 | 0·010 | 0·056 |\r\n  +----------+---------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n\r\n\r\n2. HYOSCYAMINE.\r\n\r\n§ 456. This powerful alkaloid is contained in small quantities in datura\r\nand belladonna, and also is found in the common lettuce (·001 per\r\ncent.),[507] and in _Scopola carmolica_, a solanaceous plant\r\nindigenous to Austria and Hungary[508]; but its chief source is the\r\n_Hyoscyamus niger_ and _Hyoscyamus alba_ (black and white henbane): it\r\nis also found in the _Duboisia myoporoides_. The latter plant was\r\nconsidered to contain a new alkaloid, “_Duboisine_,” but duboisine is a\r\nmixture of hyoscyamine and hyoscine. Ladenburg’s hyoscine accompanies\r\nhyoscyamine, and is an isomeride of both atropine and hyoscyamine; its\r\nchemical reactions are similar to those of hyoscyamine, as well as its\r\nphysiological effects.[509]\r\n\r\n[507] T. S. Dymond, _Journ. Chem. Soc. Trans._, 1892, 90.\r\n\r\n[508] W. R. Dunstan and A. E. Chaston. _Pharm. Journ. Trans._ (3), xx.\r\n461-464.\r\n\r\n[509] See _Ber. der deutsch. Chem. Gesell._, 13, 1549 to 1554. By\r\nboiling hyoscine hydrochloride with animal charcoal, and then\r\nprecipitating with auric chloride, a good crystalline compound, melting\r\nat 198°, can be obtained.\r\n\r\n=Hyoscyamine= (C₁₇H₂₃NO₃), as separated in the course of analysis, is a\r\nresinoid, sticky, amorphous mass, difficult to dry, and possessing a\r\ntobacco-like odour. It can, however, be obtained in well-marked\r\nodourless crystals, which melt at 108°-109°, a portion subliming\r\nunchanged. It liquefies under boiling water without crystallisation.\r\nAccording to Thorey,[510] hyoscyamine crystallises out of chloroform in\r\nrhombic tables, and out of benzene in fine needles; but out of ether or\r\namyl alcohol it remains amorphous. When perfectly pure, it dissolves\r\nwith difficulty in cold, but more readily in hot, water; if impure, it\r\nis hygroscopic, and its solubility is much increased. In any case, it\r\ndissolves easily in alcohol, ether, chloroform, amyl alcohol, benzene,\r\nand dilute acids. Hyoscyamine neutralises acids fully, and forms\r\ncrystallisable salts, which assume for the most part the form of\r\nneedles. It is isomeric with atropine, and is converted into atropine by\r\nheating to 110°, or warming with alcoholic potash. The gold salt melts\r\nat 159°, and does not melt in boiling water like the atropine gold salt.\r\n\r\n[510] _Pharm. Zeitschr. f. Russl._, 1869.\r\n\r\n§ 457. =Pharmaceutical and other Preparations of Henbane.=--The leaves\r\nare alone officinal in the European pharmacopœias; but the seeds and the\r\nroot, or the flowers, may be met with occasionally, especially among\r\nherbalists. The table[511] (p. 382) will give an idea of the alkaloidal\r\ncontent of the different parts of the plant.\r\n\r\n[511] This table, taken from Dragendorff’s _Chemische Werthbestimmung\r\neiniger starkwirkenden Droguen_, embodies the researches of Thorey.\r\n\r\nIn order to ascertain the percentage of the alkaloid in any part of the\r\nplant, the process followed by Thorey has the merit of simplicity. The\r\nsubstance is first exhausted by petroleum ether, which frees it from\r\nfat; after drying, it is extracted with 85 per cent. alcohol at a\r\ntemperature not exceeding 40°. The alcoholic extracts are then united,\r\nthe alcohol distilled off, and the residue filtered. The filtrate is now\r\nfirst purified by agitation with petroleum ether, then saturated by\r\nammonia, and shaken up with chloroform. The latter, on evaporation,\r\nleaves the alkaloid only slightly impure, and, after washing with\r\ndistilled water, if dissolved in dilute sulphuric acid, a crystalline\r\nsulphate may be readily obtained.\r\n\r\n=A tincture and an extract of henbane leaves and flowering tops= are\r\nofficinal in most pharmacopœias; an extract of the seeds in that of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\n=An oil of hyoscyamus= is officinal in all the Continental\r\npharmacopœias, but not in the British.\r\n\r\n=Henbane juice= is recognised by the British pharmacopœia; it is about\r\nthe same strength as the tincture.\r\n\r\n=An ointment=, made of one part of the extract to nine of simple\r\nointment, is officinal in the German pharmacopœia.\r\n\r\nThe tincture (after distilling off the spirit) and the extracts (on\r\nproper solution) may be conveniently titrated by Mayer’s reagent (p.\r\n263), which, for this purpose, should be diluted one-half; each c.c.\r\nthen, according to Dragendorff, equalling 6·98 mgrms. of hyoscyamine.\r\nKruse found 0·042 per cent. of hyoscyamine in a Russian tincture, and\r\n·28 per cent. in a Russian extract. Any preparation made with extract of\r\nhenbane will be found to contain nitrate of potash, for Attfield has\r\nshown the extract to be rich in this substance. The ointment will\r\nrequire extraction of the fat by petroleum ether; this accomplished, the\r\ndetermination of its strength is easy.\r\n\r\n=The oil of hyoscyamus= is poisonous, and contains the alkaloid. An\r\nexact quantitative research is difficult; but if 20 grms. of the oil are\r\nshaken up for some time with water acidified by sulphuric acid, the\r\nfluid separated from the oil, made alkaline, shaken up with chloroform,\r\nand the latter removed and evaporated, sufficient will be obtained to\r\ntest successfully for the presence of the alkaloid, by its action on the\r\npupil of the eye.\r\n\r\n§ 458. =Dose and Effects.=--The dose of the uncrystalline hyoscyamine is\r\n6 mgrms. (1/10 grain), carefully increased. I have seen it extensively\r\nused in asylums to calm violent or troublesome maniacs. Thirty-two\r\nmgrms. (½ grain) begin to act within a quarter of an hour; the face\r\nflushes, the pupils dilate, there is no excitement, all muscular motion\r\nis enfeebled, and the patient remains quiet for many hours, the effects\r\nfrom a single dose not uncommonly lasting two days. 64·8 mgrms. (1\r\ngrain) would be a very large, and possibly fatal, dose. The absence of\r\ndelirium or excitement, with full doses of hyoscyamine, is a striking\r\ncontrast to the action of atropine, in every other respect so closely\r\nallied; yet there are cases on record showing that the henbane root\r\nitself has an action similar to that of belladonna, unless indeed one\r\nroot has been mistaken for another; _e.g._, Sonnenschein relates the\r\nfollowing ancient case of poisoning:--In a certain cloister the monks\r\nate by error the root of henbane. In the night they were all taken with\r\nhallucinations, so that the pious convent was like a madhouse. One monk\r\nsounded at midnight the matins, some who thereupon came into chapel\r\ncould not read, others read what was not in the book, others sang\r\ndrinking songs--in short, there was the greatest disturbance.\r\n\r\n§ 459. =Separation of Hyoscyamine from Organic Matters.=--The isolation\r\nof the alkaloid from organic tissues or fluids, in cases where a\r\nmedicinal preparation of henbane, or of the leaves, root, &c., has been\r\ntaken, is possible, and should be carried out on the principles already\r\ndetailed. Hyoscyamine is mainly identified by its power of dilating the\r\npupil of the eye. It is said that so small a quantity as ·0083 mgrm.\r\n(1/4000 grain) will in fifteen minutes dilate the eye of a rabbit. It is\r\ntrue that atropine also dilates the pupil; but if sufficient of the\r\nsubstance should have been isolated to apply other tests, it can be\r\ndistinguished from atropine by the fact that the latter gives no\r\nimmediate precipitate with platinic chloride, whilst hyoscyamine is\r\nprecipitated by a small quantity of platinic chloride, and dissolved by\r\na larger amount, and also by the characters of the gold salt.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. HYOSCINE.\r\n\r\n    § 460. =Hyoscine=, C₁₇H₂₃NO₃.--According to E. Schmidt[512] the\r\n    formula is C₁₇H₂₁NO₄ + H₂O, and the alkaloid is identical with\r\n    scopolamine. Scopolamine has a m.p. of 59°, gives an aurochloride,\r\n    crystallising in needles, the m.p. of which is 212° to 214°; when\r\n    boiled with baryta water, it splits up into atropic acid and\r\n    scopoline, a base (C₈H₁₃NO), m.p. 110°, boiling-point, 241° to 243°;\r\n    scopoline forms an aurochloride, m.p. 223°-225°; and a\r\n    platinochloride, m.p. 228°-230°; but Ladenburg,[513] in answer to\r\n    Schmidt, asserts that hyoscine exists, and is not identical with\r\n    scopolamine.

Pure hyoscine gold chloride is\r\n    stated to melt at 198°. Its reactions are much the same as those of\r\n    atropine, but it does not blacken calomel. It is very poisonous.\r\n\r\n[512] _Arch.

SOLANINE.\r\n\r\n    § 461. =Distribution of Solanine.=--Solanine is a poisonous\r\n    nitrogenised glucoside found in all parts of the plants belonging to\r\n    the nightshade order. The English common plants in which solanine\r\n    occurs are the edible potato plant (_Solanum tuberosum_), the\r\n    nightshade (_Solanum nigrum_), and the _Solanum dulcamara_, or\r\n    bitter-sweet. The berries of the _Solanum nigrum_ and those of _S.\r\n    dulcamara_ contain about 0·3 per cent. Mature healthy potatoes\r\n    appear to contain no solanine, but from 150 grms. of diseased\r\n    potatoes G. Kassner[515] separated 30 to 50 mgrms.\r\n\r\n[515] _Arch. Pharm._ (3), xxv. 402, 403.\r\n\r\n    R. Firbas,[516] in a research on the active substances or young\r\n    shoots of the _S. tuberosum_ found two products--one crystalline,\r\n    _Solanine_; the other amorphous, _Solaneine_. He gives the following\r\n    formula to solanine--C₅₂H₉₃NO₁₈4½H₂O; when dried at 100° it becomes\r\n    anhydrous. From a solution in 85 per cent. alcohol it crystallises\r\n    in colourless needles, m.p. 244°; these are almost insoluble in\r\n    ether and alcohol, but are readily dissolved in dilute hydrochloric\r\n    acid. On hydrolysis solanine breaks up into solanidine and a sugar,\r\n    according to the equation--\r\n\r\n[516] _Monatsh._, x. 541-560; _Journ. Chem. Soc._ (Abst.), Jan. 1890.\r\n\r\n  C₅₂H₉₃NO₁₈ = C₄₀H₆₁NO₂ + 2C₆H₁₂O₆ + 4H₂O.\r\n\r\n    § 462. =Properties of Solanine.=--The reaction of the crystals is\r\n    weakly alkaline; the taste is somewhat bitter and pungent. Solanine\r\n    is soluble in 8000 parts of boiling water, 4000 parts of ether, 500\r\n    parts of cold, and 125 of boiling alcohol. It dissolves well in hot\r\n    amyl alcohol, but is scarcely soluble in benzene. An aqueous\r\n    solution froths on shaking, but not to the degree possessed by\r\n    saponine solutions.\r\n\r\n    The amyl alcohol solution has the property of gelatinising when\r\n    cold. It does this if even so little as 1 part of solanine is\r\n    dissolved in 2000 of hot amyl alcohol. The jelly is so firm that the\r\n    vessel may be inverted without any loss. This peculiar property is\r\n    one of the most important tests for the presence of solanine. The\r\n    hot ethylic alcohol solution will, on cooling, also gelatinise, but\r\n    a stronger solution is required. From very dilute alcoholic\r\n    solutions (and especially with slow cooling) solanine may be\r\n    obtained in crystals. In dilute mineral acids solanine dissolves\r\n    freely, and forms salts, which for the most part have an acid\r\n    reaction and are soluble in alcohol and in water, but with\r\n    difficulty in ether. The compounds with the acids are not very\r\n    stable, and several of them are broken up on warming the solution,\r\n    solanine separating out from the aqueous solutions of the solanine\r\n    salts. The alkaloid may be precipitated by the fixed and volatile\r\n    alkalies, and by the alkaline earths. Solanine will stand boiling\r\n    with strongly alkaline solutions without decomposition; but dilute\r\n    acids, on warming, hydrolyse. By heating solanine in alcoholic\r\n    solution with ethyl iodide in closed tubes, and then treating the\r\n    liquid with ammonia, ethyl solanine in well-formed crystals can be\r\n    obtained. Solanine is precipitated by phosphomolybdic acid, but by\r\n    very few other substances. It gives, for example, no precipitate\r\n    with the following reagents:--Platinic chloride, gold chloride,\r\n    mercuric chloride, potassic bichromate, and picric acid. Tannin\r\n    precipitates it only after a time. Sodic phosphate gives a\r\n    crystalline precipitate of solanine phosphate, if added to a\r\n    solution of solanine sulphate. Both solanine and solanidine give\r\n    with nitric acid at first a colourless solution, which, on gentle\r\n    warming, passes into blue, then into light red, and lastly becomes\r\n    weakly yellow. Solanine, dissolved in strong sulphuric acid, to\r\n    which a little Fröhde’s reagent is added, at first colours the fluid\r\n    light brown; after standing some time the edges of the drop becomes\r\n    reddish-yellow, and finally the whole a beautiful cherry-red, which\r\n    gradually passes into dark violet when violet-coloured flocks\r\n    separate.\r\n\r\n    § 463. =Solanidine.=--Solanidine has stronger basic properties than\r\n    solanine. Its formula is C₄₀H₆₁NO₂. It is obtained from an alcoholic\r\n    solution in amorphous masses interspersed with needles; m.p. 191°.\r\n    It dissolves readily in hot alcohol, with difficulty in ether. With\r\n    hydrochloric acid it forms a hydrochloride--3(C₄₀H₆₁NO₂HCl)HCl + H₂O\r\n    or 1½H₂O. This hydrochloride is a slightly yellow powder, only\r\n    sparingly soluble in water, and carbonising without melting when\r\n    heated to 287°. Solanidine also forms a sulphate,\r\n    3(C₄₀H₆₁NO₂H₂SO₄)H₂SO₄ + 8H₂O; this salt is in the form of scaly\r\n    plates, melting at 247°; it dissolves readily in water.\r\n\r\n    The sugar obtained from the hydrolysis of solanidine is a yellow\r\n    amorphous mass dissolving readily in water and wood spirit, and has\r\n    a specific rotatory power of [α]_{D} = + 28·623. With\r\n    Phenylhydrazine hydrochloride and sodium acetate in aqueous solution\r\n    it forms a glucosazone, melting at 199°. It is probably a mixture of\r\n    sugars.\r\n\r\n    Solaneine is the name that has been given to the amorphous substance\r\n    accompanying solanine; on hydrolysis it yields solanidine and the\r\n    same sugar as solanine. Its formula is C₅₂H₈₂NO₁₃ with 4H₂O.\r\n\r\n    § 464. =Poisoning from Solanine.=--Poisoning from solanine has been,\r\n    in all recorded cases, induced, not by the pure alkaloid (which is\r\n    scarcely met with out of the laboratory of the scientific chemist),\r\n    but by the berries of the different species of _Solanum_, and has\r\n    for the most part been confined to children. The symptoms in about\r\n    twenty cases,[517] which may be found detailed in the medical\r\n    literature of this century, have varied so greatly that the most\r\n    opposite phenomena have been witnessed as effects of poisoning by\r\n    the same substance. The most constant phenomena are a quick pulse,\r\n    laboured respiration, great restlessness, and hyperæsthesia of the\r\n    skin. Albumen in the urine is common. Nervous symptoms, such as\r\n    convulsions, aphasia, delirium, and even catalepsy, have been\r\n    witnessed. In some cases there have been the symptoms of an irritant\r\n    poison--diarrhœa, vomiting, and pain in the bowels: in many cases\r\n    dilatation of the pupil has been observed.\r\n\r\n[517] See “Death of Three Children by _S. nigrum_”; Hirtz., _Gaz. Med.\r\nde Strasbourg_, 1842; Maury, _Gaz. des Hôp._, 1864; J. B. Montane,\r\n_Chim. Med._, 1862; Magne, _Gaz. des Hôp._, 1869; Manners, _Edin. Med.\r\nJourn._, 1867. Cases of poisoning by bitter-sweet berries are recorded\r\nin _Lancet_, 1856; C. Bourdin, _Gaz des Hôpitaux_, 1864; Bourneville,\r\nthe berries of _S. tuberosum_, _Brit. Med. Journ._, 1859.\r\n\r\n    Rabbits are killed by doses of ·1 grm. per kilo. The symptoms\r\n    commence in about ten minutes after the administration, and consist\r\n    of apathy and a low temperature; the breathing is much slowed.\r\n    Convulsions set in suddenly before death, and the pupils become\r\n    dilated. The _post-mortem_ appearances in animals are intense\r\n    redness and injection of the meninges of the cerebellum, of the\r\n    medulla oblongata, and the spinal cord. Dark red blood is found in\r\n    the heart, and the kidneys are hyperæmic. The intestinal mucous\r\n    membrane is normal.\r\n\r\n    § 465. =Separation of Solanine from the Tissues of the\r\n    Body.=--Dragendorff has proved the possibility of separating\r\n    solanine from animal tissues by extracting it from a poisoned pig.\r\n    The best plan seems to be to extract with cold dilute sulphuric acid\r\n    water, which is then made alkaline by ammonia, and shaken up with\r\n    warm amyl alcohol. This readily dissolves any solanine. The peculiar\r\n    property possessed by the alkaloid of gelatinising, and the play of\r\n    colours with Fröhde’s reagent, may then be essayed on the solanine\r\n    thus separated.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. CYTISINE.\r\n\r\n§466. =The Cytisus Laburnum.=--The laburnum tree, _Cytisus laburnum_, so\r\ncommon in shrubberies, is intensely poisonous. The flowers, bark, wood,\r\nseeds, and the root have all caused serious symptoms. The active\r\nprinciple is an alkaloid, to which the name of Cytisine has been given.\r\nThe best source is the seeds. The seeds are powdered and extracted with\r\nalcohol containing hydrochloric acid, the alcohol distilled off, the\r\nresidue treated with water and filtered through a wet filter to remove\r\nany fatty oil, the filtrate treated with lead acetate; and, after\r\nseparating the precipitated colouring matter, made alkaline with caustic\r\npotash, and shaken with amyl alcohol. The amyl alcohol is shaken with\r\ndilute hydrochloric acid, the solution evaporated, the crude crystals\r\nof hydrochloride thus obtained treated with alcohol to remove colouring\r\nmatters, and recrystallised several times from water; it then forms\r\nwell-developed, colourless, transparent prisms. From the hydrochloride\r\nthe free base is readily obtained.\r\n\r\n=Cytisine=, C₁₁H₁₄N₂O.--To cytisine used to be ascribed the formula\r\nC₂₀H₂₇N₃O, but a study of the salt and new determinations appear to\r\nprove that it is identical with ulexine.[518] Cytisine is in the form of\r\nwhite radiating crystals, consisting, when deposited from absolute\r\nalcohol, of anhydrous prisms, which melt at from 152° to 153°. Cytisine\r\nhas a strong alkaline reaction; it is soluble in water, alcohol, and\r\nchloroform, less so in benzene and amyl alcohol, almost insoluble in\r\ncold light petroleum, and insoluble in pure ether. The specific rotatory\r\npower in solution is [α]_{D}17° = -119·57.\r\n\r\n[518] A. W. Gerrard and W. H. Symons dispute this; they ascribe to\r\nulexine the formula of C₁₁H₁₄N₂O, to cytisine C₂₀H₂₇N₃O. Ulexine is very\r\nhygroscopic, cannot be sublimed, even in a vacuum, without\r\ndecomposition, and dissolves readily in chloroform; on the contrary,\r\ncytisine is not hygroscopic, sublimes completely, and is almost\r\ninsoluble in chloroform, _Pharm. J._ (3), xx. 1017.\r\n\r\nA. Partheil, _Ber._, xxiii. 3201-3203; _Arch. Pharm._, ccxxx. 448-498.\r\n\r\nIt is capable of sublimation in a current of hydrogen at 154·5°; the\r\nsublimate is in the form of very long needles and small leaflets; at\r\nhigher temperatures it melts to a yellow oily fluid, again becoming\r\ncrystalline on cooling. Cytisine is a strong base; it precipitates the\r\nearths and oxides of the heavy metals from solutions of the chlorides,\r\nand, even in the cold, expels ammonia from its combinations.\r\n\r\nCytisine forms numerous crystalline salts, among which may be mentioned\r\ntwo platinochlorides, C₁₁H₁₄N₂OH₂PtCl₆ + 2½H₂O and (C₁₁H₁₄N₂O)₂H₂PtCl₆,\r\ncrystallising in golden yellow needles, which are tolerably soluble in\r\nwater; and the aurochloride, C₁₁H₁₄N₂OHAuCl₄, crystallising in short,\r\nred-brown, hook-shaped needles; m.p. 212° to 213°, without evolution of\r\ngas.\r\n\r\n§ 467. =Reactions of Cytisine.=--Concentrated sulphuric acid dissolves\r\ncytisine without colour; if to the solution is added a drop of nitric\r\nacid, it becomes orange-yellow, and on addition of a crystal of potassic\r\nbichromate, first yellow, then dirty brown, and lastly green.\r\nConcentrated nitric acid dissolves the base in the cold without colour,\r\nbut, on warming, it becomes orange-yellow. Picric, tannic, and\r\nphosphomolybdic acids, potassic, mercuric, and potass. cadmium iodides,\r\nand iodine with potassic iodide, all give precipitates. Neither potassic\r\nbichromate nor mercuric chloride precipitates cytisine, even though the\r\nsolution be concentrated. The best single test appears to be the\r\nreaction discovered by Magelhaes; this consists in adding thymol to a\r\nsolution of cytisine in concentrated sulphuric acid, when a yellow\r\ncolour, finally passing into an intense red, is produced.\r\n\r\n§ 468. =Effects on Animals.=--W. Marmé found subcutaneous doses of from\r\n30 to 40 mgrms. fatal to cats; death was from paralysis of the\r\nrespiration, and could be avoided by artificial respiration. Cattle are\r\nsometimes accidentally poisoned by laburnum. An instance of this is\r\nrecorded in the _Veterinarian_ (vol. lv. p. 92). In Lanark a storm had\r\nblown a large laburnum tree down to the ground; it fell into a field in\r\nwhich some young heifers were grazing, and they began to feed on the\r\nleaves and pods. Two or three died, and three more were ill for some\r\ntime, but ultimately recovered.\r\n\r\nThe laburnum, however, does not always have this effect, for there is a\r\ncase related in the _Gardeners’ Chronicle_, in which five cows browsed\r\nfor some time on the branches and pods of an old laburnum tree that had\r\nbeen thrown aside. Rabbits and hares are said to feed eagerly, and\r\nwithout injury, on the pods and branches.\r\n\r\n§ 469. =Effects on Man.=--The sweet taste of many portions of the\r\nlaburnum tree, as well as its attractive appearance, has been the cause\r\nof many accidents. F. A. Falck has been able to collect from medical\r\nliterature no less than 155 cases--120 of which were those of the\r\naccidental poisoning of children: only 4 (or 2·6 per cent.), however,\r\ndied, so that the poison is not of a very deadly character.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest recorded cases is by Christison.[519] A servant-girl\r\nof Inverness, in order to excite vomiting in her fellow-servant (the\r\ncook), boiled some laburnum bark in soup; very soon after partaking of\r\nthis soup, the cook experienced violent vomiting, which lasted for\r\nthirty-six hours; she had intense pain in the stomach, much diarrhœa,\r\nand great muscular weakness; she appears to have suffered from\r\ngastro-intestinal catarrh for some time, but ultimately recovered.\r\n\r\n[519] _Ed. Med. Journ._, 1843.\r\n\r\nVallance[520] has described the symptoms observed in the poisoning of\r\nfifty-eight boys, who ate the root of an old laburnum tree, being\r\nallured by its sweet taste. All were taken ill with similar symptoms,\r\ndiffering only in severity; two who had eaten half an ounce (nearly 8\r\ngrms.) suffered with especial severity. The symptoms were first\r\nvomiting, then narcosis, with convulsive movements of the legs and\r\nstrange movements of the arms: the pupils were dilated. This dilatation\r\nof the pupil Sedgwick also saw in the poisoning of two children who ate\r\nthe root. On the other hand, when the flower, seeds, or other portions\r\nof the laburnum have been eaten, the symptoms are mainly referable to\r\nthe gastro-intestinal tract, consisting of acute pain in the stomach,\r\nvomiting, and diarrhœa. On these grounds it is therefore more than\r\nprobable that there is another active principle in the root, differing\r\nfrom that which is in those portions of the tree exposed to the\r\ninfluence of sunlight.[521]\r\n\r\n[520] _Brit. Med. Journ._, 1875.\r\n\r\n[521] See also a case related by Dr. Popham, in which ten children ate\r\nlaburnum seeds; the pupils were dilated. They all recovered. _B. and F.\r\nMed. Chir. Review_, Ap. 1863; also a case reported by H. Usher, _Med.\r\nTimes and Gazette_, Sept. 15, 1862.\r\n\r\nThe _post-mortem_ appearances are, so far as known, in no way\r\ncharacteristic.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.--The Alkaloids of the Veratrums.\r\n\r\n§ 470. The alkaloids of the veratrums have been investigated by Dr.\r\nAlder Wright, Dr. A. P. Luff, and several other chemists.[522]\r\n\r\n[522] “The Alkaloids of the Veratrums,” by C. R. Alder Wright, D.Sc.,\r\nand A. P. Luff, _Journ. Chem. Soc._, July 1879; “The Alkaloids of\r\n_Veratrum viride_,” by C. Alder Wright, D.Sc., _ib._, 1879.\r\n\r\nThe method which Wright and Luff adopted to extract and separate these\r\nalkaloids from the root of _V. album_ and _V. viride_, essentially\r\nconsisted in exhausting with alcohol, to which a little tartaric acid\r\nhas been added, filtering, distilling off the alcohol, dissolving the\r\nresidue in water, alkalising with caustic soda, and shaking up with\r\nether. The ethereal solution was next separated, and then washed with\r\nwater containing tartaric acid, so as to obtain a solution of the bases\r\nas tartrates: in this way the same ether could be used over and over\r\nagain. Ultimately a rough separation was made by means of the different\r\nsolubilities in ether, pseudo-jervine being scarcely soluble in this\r\nmedium, whilst jervine, veratralbine, veratrine, and cevadine are very\r\nsoluble in it.\r\n\r\nThe yield of Wright and Luff’s alkaloids was as follows:--\r\n\r\nTABLE SHOWING THE ALKALOIDS IN THE VERATRUMS.\r\n\r\n  +---------------+------------+---------------------+\r\n  |               | V. album.  |    V. viride.       |\r\n  |               | Per Kilo.  |     Per Kilo.       |\r\n  |               +------------+---------------------+\r\n  |Jervine,       |  1·3 grm.  |    ·2  grm.         |\r\n  |Pseudo-jervine,|   ·4  „    |    ·15  „           |\r\n  |Rubi-jervine,  |   ·25 „    |    ·02  „           |\r\n  |Veratralbine,  |  2·2  „    |    Traces.          |\r\n  |Veratrine,     |   ·05 „    | Less than ·004 grm. |\r\n  |Cevadine,      |  Absent.   |     „     ·43   „   |\r\n  +---------------+------------+---------------------+\r\n\r\nFrom whence it appears that _V. album_ has only a very small quantity of\r\nveratrine, that it is almost absent in _V. viride_; on the other hand,\r\n_V. viride_ contains a fair quantity of cevadine, an alkaloid absent in\r\n_V. album_.\r\n\r\nBesides the six principles enumerated, G. Salzberger has recently\r\nseparated two other crystalline substances, to which he has given the\r\nnames of _protoveratrine_ and _protoveratridine_, and Pehkschen has also\r\nseparated a ninth substance, to which he has given the name of\r\n_veratroidine_.\r\n\r\nThe formulæ of the nine bodies which have been separated from hellebore\r\nroot are as follows:--\r\n\r\n                                                 Melting-point.\r\n  1.

Protoveratridine, C₂₆H₄₅NO₈,                        265°\r\n  7. Rubi-jervine, { C₂₆H₄₃NO₂ (_Wright_ and _Luff_),    236°\r\n                   {           (_Salzberger_),        240°-245°\r\n  8.

Veratroidine, C₃₂H₅₃NO₉,                            149°\r\n\r\nThree of these alkaloids possess powerful sternutatory properties, the\r\nleast quantity applied to the nostrils exciting sneezing; the three are\r\nveratrine, cevadine, and protoveratrine.\r\n\r\nProtoveratrine, C₃₂H₅₁NO₁₁, has been obtained by G. Salzberger[523] from\r\npowdered hellebore root, by the following process:--\r\n\r\n[523] _Arch. Pharm._, ccxxviii. 462-483.\r\n\r\nThe powdered root is first freed from fatty and resinous matters by\r\ntreatment with ether, and then the fat-free powder is exhausted with\r\nalcohol. The alcohol is evaporated off in a vacuum, the extract mixed\r\nwith much acetic acid water, filtered from the insoluble residue, and\r\ntreated with metaphosphoric acid; the voluminous precipitate contains\r\nmuch amorphous matter, with insoluble compounds of jervine and\r\nrubi-jervine. The precipitate is filtered off, and the filtrate treated\r\nwith excess of ammonia and shaken up with ether. On separating the ether\r\nand distilling, protoveratrine crystallises out, and can be obtained\r\npure by recrystallisation from strong alcohol.\r\n\r\nProtoveratrine crystallises in four-sided plates, which melt with\r\ncharring at 245° to 250°. The base is insoluble in water, benzene, and\r\nlight petroleum; chloroform and boiling 96 per cent. alcohol dissolve it\r\nsomewhat; cold ether scarcely touches it, boiling ether dissolves it a\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\nConcentrated sulphuric acid dissolves the alkaloid slowly with the\r\nproduction of a greenish colour, which passes to cornflower blue, and,\r\nafter some hours, becomes violet. Sulphuric acid and sugar gives a\r\ndifferent colour to that produced by commercial veratrine. There is\r\nfirst a green colour which darkens into olive green, then becomes dirty\r\ngreen, and finally dark brown. When warmed with strong sulphuric,\r\nhydrochloric, or phosphoric acids, there is a strong odour of\r\nisobutyric acid developed. Dilute solutions of the salts are\r\nprecipitated by ammonia, Nessler’s reagent, gold chloride, potassium\r\nmercury iodide, cadmium iodide, phosphotungstic acid, and picric acid;\r\nno precipitate is produced by tannin, platinum chloride, or mercuric\r\nchloride.\r\n\r\n§ 471. =Veratrine= (C₃₇H₅₃NO₁₁) is a crystallisable alkaloid, which is a\r\npowerful irritant of the sensory nerves of the mucous membrane, and\r\nexcites violent sneezing. Treated with concentrated sulphuric acid, it\r\ndissolves with a yellow colour, deepening into orange, then into\r\nblood-red, and finally passing into carmine-red. If the freshly-prepared\r\nsulphuric acid solution is now treated with bromine water, a beautiful\r\npurple colour is produced. Concentrated hydrochloric acid dissolves\r\nveratrine without the production of colour, but, with careful warming,\r\nit becomes beautifully red. This reaction is very delicate, occurring\r\nwith ·17 mgrm. On saponification veratrine yields veratric acid.\r\n\r\nVeratric acid is procatechu-dimethylether acid, and has the\r\nconstitutional formula,\r\n\r\n       COOH\r\n      /\r\n  C₆H₃\r\n      \\\r\n       (OCH₃)₂\r\n\r\nVeratric acid forms colourless needles and four-sided prisms which have\r\na marked acid reaction; it melts on heating to a colourless fluid, and\r\nsublimes without decomposition; it is easily soluble in hot alcohol, but\r\ninsoluble in ether. If dissolved in nitric acid, water separates\r\nnitro-veratric acid, C₉H₉(NO₂)O₄ which crystallises out of alcohol in\r\nsmall yellow scales. Veratric acid unites with bases forming crystalline\r\nsalts; the silver salt has the composition of C₉H₉AgO₄ = 37·37 per cent.\r\nsilver, and may assist in identification. It is crystalline with a\r\nmelting point of 205° to 206°.\r\n\r\n=Cevadine=, C₃₂H₄₉NO₉ (Merck’s veratrine).--It has powerful sternutatory\r\nproperties, and, under the influence of alcoholic potash, yields\r\ntiglic[524] acid and cevine, C₂₇H₄₃NO₈.\r\n\r\n[524] Tiglic acid, C₅H₈O₂, is a volatile acid, m.p. 64°, boiling point,\r\n198·5°; it forms a soluble barium salt, and an insoluble silver salt.\r\n\r\nAccording to Ahrens, angelic acid is first formed, and then converted\r\ninto tiglic acid. When the alkaloid is boiled with hydrochloric acid,\r\ntiglic acid is formed, and a ruby red mass. Nitric acid oxidises\r\ncevadine completely; with potassic permanganate it yields acetic and\r\noxalic acids; with chromic acid it forms acetaldehyde and carbon\r\ndioxide.[525]\r\n\r\n[525] _Ber._, xxiii. 2700-2707.\r\n\r\nThe Continental authorities always give to cevadine the name of\r\nveratrine. Cevadine forms a crystalline aurochloride, a crystalline\r\nmercurochloride, C₃₂H₄₉NO₉HHgCl₃, and a crystalline picrate,\r\nC₃₂H₄₉NO₉C₆H₃N₈O₇. The mercury salt crystallises in small silvery\r\nplates, and melts with decomposition at 172°. The picrate forms stable\r\ncrystals blackening at 225°; both of the latter salts are but little\r\nsoluble in water, but are soluble in alcohol. Cevadine also unites with\r\nbromine, forming a tetrabromide, an amorphous yellow powder insoluble in\r\nwater, but readily soluble in alcohol, ether, and chloroform.\r\n\r\n§ 472. =Jervine=, (C₂₆H₃₇NO₃2H₂O) (_Wright_ and _Luff_), C₁₄H₂₂NO₂\r\n(_Pehkschen_),[526] crystallises in white needles, and, when anhydrous,\r\nmelts at 237·7°. It is slightly lævorotatory. At 25° one part of the\r\nbase dissolves in 1658 benzene, 268 ether, 60 chloroform, and 16·8\r\nabsolute alcohol. It is insoluble in light petroleum, and but slightly\r\nsoluble in ethyl acetate, water, or carbon bisulphide. It forms a very\r\ninsoluble sulphate, and a sparingly soluble nitrate and hydrochloride.\r\nJervine gives, with sulphuric acid and sugar, a violet colour, passing\r\nto blue. Treated with strong sulphuric acid it dissolves to a yellow\r\nfluid, which becomes successively dark yellow, brownish yellow, and then\r\ngreenish. The green shade is immediately developed by diluting with\r\nwater. Jervine does not produce sneezing.\r\n\r\n[526] _Jour. Pharm._ (5), xxii. 265-269.\r\n\r\n§ 473. =Pseudo-jervine=, C₂₉H₄₃NO₇ (_Wright_), m.p. 299°; C₂₉H₄₉NO₁₂,\r\nm.p. 259° (_Pehkschen_), may be obtained in a crystalline state. One\r\npart is soluble in 10·9 parts of light petroleum, 372 parts of benzene,\r\n1021 parts of ether, 4 of chloroform, and 185 of absolute alcohol. The\r\npure base gives no colour with sulphuric, nitric, or hydrochloric acids.\r\nIt does not produce sneezing.\r\n\r\n§ 474. =Protoveratridine=, C₂₆H₄₅NO₈, is probably derived from\r\nprotoveratrine. Salzberger[527] isolated it from powdered hellebore\r\nroots by treating the powder with barium hydroxide and water, and\r\nextracting with ether. The ether extract was separated and freed from\r\nether in a current of hydrogen at a low temperature.\r\n\r\n[527] _Arch. Pharm._, ccxxviii. 462-483.\r\n\r\nFrom the dark green syrup obtained jervine crystallised out, and from\r\nthe mother liquor ultimately protoveratridine was separated.\r\n\r\nProtoveratridine crystallises in colourless four-sided plates, which\r\nmelt at 265°. It is almost insoluble in alcohol, chloroform, methyl\r\nalcohol, and acetone, and insoluble in benzene, light petroleum, and\r\nether. Concentrated sulphuric acid gives a violet, then a cherry-red\r\ncolour. Its solution in concentrated hydrochloric acid becomes light red\r\non warming, and there is an odour of isobutyric acid. It is readily\r\nsoluble in dilute mineral acids, and the solution, on the addition of\r\nammonia, yields the alkaloid in a crystalline condition. The sulphuric\r\nacid solution gives precipitates with phosphotungstic, picric, and\r\ntannic acids, and with potassium mercury iodide; but gives no\r\nprecipitate with platinum chloride, potassium-cadmium iodide, or with\r\nMillon’s reagent.\r\n\r\nIt forms a platinum salt, (C₂₆H₄₅NO₈)₂H₂PtCl₆ + 6H₂O, which is\r\nprecipitated in large six-sided plates on adding alcohol to a mixed\r\nsolution of platinum chloride and a salt of the base.\r\n\r\nProtoveratridine is not poisonous, and does not cause sneezing. Its\r\nsolutions are very bitter.\r\n\r\n§ 475. =Rubi-jervine=, C₂₆H₄₃NO₂, is a crystallisable base wholly\r\ndifferent from jervine, yet probably closely allied to it. It forms a\r\nlight yellow, indistinctly crystalline gold salt (C₂₆H₄₃NO₂,HCl,AuCl₃):\r\nit gives a different play of colours from jervine with sulphuric acid.\r\nThe concentrated acid dissolves rubi-jervine to a clear yellow fluid,\r\nbecoming successively dark yellow, brownish yellow, and brownish\r\nblood-red, changing after several hours to a brownish purple. On\r\ndiluting slightly with water the brownish-red liquid, it becomes\r\nsuccessively crimson, purple, dark lavender, dark violet, and ultimately\r\nlight indigo. Its hydrochloride and sulphate are both more soluble than\r\neither of the corresponding salts of jervine or pseudo-jervine.\r\n\r\n§ 476. =Veratralbine=, C₂₈H₄₃NO₅, an amorphous non-sternutatory base,\r\ngives, when a speck of the substance is dissolved in sulphuric acid, a\r\nplay of colours, becoming successively yellow, dark yellow, brownish\r\norange, and brownish blood-red, with a strong green fluorescence. It\r\nyields no acid on saponification.\r\n\r\n§ 477. =Veratroidine=, C₃₂H₅₃NO₉, is another base which has been\r\nseparated by C. Pehkschen.[528] Its melting point is 149°. One part\r\ndissolves in 13 of benzene, 59 of chloroform, and 9 of ether. It yields\r\namorphous salts with the mineral acids, and with oxalic and acetic\r\nacids. It is precipitated by most of the group reagents. With 11 per\r\ncent. solution of hydrochloric acid it gives a beautiful rose colour.\r\n\r\n[528] _Op. cit._\r\n\r\n§ 478. =Commercial Veratrine.=--Commercial veratrine is a mixture of\r\nalkaloids, and has usually fairly constant properties, one of which is\r\nits intense irritant action on the nostrils. Placed on moist blue-red\r\nlitmus paper it gives a blue spot. It is but little soluble in water,\r\n1 : 1500; but readily dissolves in alcohol and chloroform; it is but\r\nlittle soluble in amyl alcohol, benzene, and carbon disulphide.\r\n\r\nWhen a very small quantity is treated with a drop of sulphuric acid, the\r\nacid in the cold strikes a yellow colour; on warming, the colour becomes\r\nviolet, slowly changing to orange and cherry red. Sensible to 100th of\r\nmgrm. If this test is performed in a test-tube, a green-yellow\r\nfluorescence is also seen on the sides of the test-tube.\r\n\r\nCommercial veratrine strikes a pink-red colour with hydrochloric acid in\r\nthe cold if a long time is allowed to elapse, but it at once appears if\r\nthe acid is warmed, and is permanent. The solution becomes fluorescent\r\nif two drops of acetic acid are added.\r\n\r\nIf a small quantity of commercial veratrine is added to melted oxalic\r\nacid and the warming continued, a blood-red colour is obtained.\r\n\r\nVeratrine, warmed with syrupy phosphoric acid, develops an odour of\r\nbutyric acid.\r\n\r\nA dark green colour, followed by reddish purple and blue colours, is\r\nobtained by adding a sprinkling of finely-powdered sugar to a solution\r\nof veratrine in sulphuric acid. This is best seen with a solution of 1\r\nto 10,000; if in dilution of 1 to 100,000 a grass-green colour is\r\nproduced, followed by purple and blue colours, quickly changing to brown\r\nor black.[529]\r\n\r\n[529] _Flückiger’s Reactions_, 1893.\r\n\r\nWhen two or three drops of sulphuric acid and furfur aldehyde (5 drops\r\nto 10 c.c. of acid) are added to minute particles of alkaloids, a more\r\nor less characteristic colour makes its appearance; this is particularly\r\nthe case with veratrine. A few particles rubbed with a glass rod, and\r\nmoistened with the reagent, gives first a yellowish-green, then an\r\nolive-green mixture, the edges afterwards becoming a beautiful blue. On\r\nwarming, the mixture gradually acquires a purple-violet colour. The blue\r\nsubstance obtained in the cold is insoluble in alcohol, ether, or\r\nchloroform. The least amount of water decolorises the solution, and, on\r\nadding much water, a fairly permanent yellow solution is obtained.[530]\r\n\r\n[530] A. Wender, _Chem. Zeitung_, xvii. 950, 951.\r\n\r\n§ 479. =Pharmaceutical Preparations.=--The alkaloid is officinal in the\r\nEnglish, American, and Continental pharmacopœias. There is also an\r\n_unguentum veratrinæ_--strength about 1·8 per cent. In the London\r\npharmacopœia of 1851 there used to be a wine of white hellebore, the\r\nactive principle of 20 parts of the root by weight being contained in\r\n100 parts by measure of the wine. Such a wine would contain about 0·084\r\nper cent. of total alkaloids. Of the green hellebore there is a tincture\r\n(_tinctura veratri viridis_), to make which four parts by weight of the\r\nroot are exhausted by 20 parts by measure of spirits; the strength\r\nvaries, but the average is 0·02 per cent. of total alkaloids.\r\n\r\n§ 480. =Fatal Dose.=--The maximum dose of the commercial alkaloid is\r\nlaid down as 10 mgrms. (·15 grain), which can be taken safely in a\r\nsingle dose, but nothing sufficiently definite is known as to what is a\r\nlethal dose. 1·3 grm. of the powdered rhizome has caused death, and, on\r\nthe other hand, ten times that quantity has been taken with impunity, so\r\nthat at present it is quite an open question.\r\n\r\n§ 481. =Effects on Animals--Physiological Action.=--Experiments on\r\nanimals have proved that the veratrums act on the sensory nerves of the\r\nskin, and those of the mucous membranes of the nose and intestinal\r\ncanal; they are first excited, afterwards paralysed. When administered\r\nto frogs, sugar and lactic acid appear in the urinary excretion.[531]\r\nIt exercises a peculiar influence on voluntary muscle; the\r\ncontractility is changed, so that, when excited, there is a\r\nlong-continuing contraction, and from a single stimulus more heat is\r\ndisengaged than with healthy muscle; the motor nerves are also affected.\r\nThe respiration, at first quickened, is then slowed, and finally\r\nparalysed. The heart’s action is also first quickened, the\r\nblood-pressure at the same time is raised, and the small arteries\r\nnarrowed in calibre; later follow sinking of the pressure, slowing of\r\nthe heart, and dilatation of the vessels, and the heart becomes finally\r\nparalysed.\r\n\r\n[531] _Zeit. Phys. Chem._, xvi. 453-459.\r\n\r\n§ 482. =Effects on Man.=--Poisoning by veratrum, sabadilla, or\r\npharmaceutical preparations containing veratrine, is not common. Plenk\r\nwitnessed a case in which the external application of sabadilla powder\r\nto the head caused delirium, and Lentin also relates a case in which an\r\ninfant at the breast seems to have died from an external application\r\nmade for the purpose of destroying lice. In both instances, however,\r\nthere is a possibility that some of the medicament was swallowed.\r\n\r\nBlas recorded, in 1861, the case of two children who drank a decoction\r\nof white hellebore, the liquid being intended as an external application\r\nto an animal. They showed serious symptoms, but ultimately recovered.\r\n\r\nA scientific chemist took 3·8 grms. (58 grains) of the tincture of green\r\nhellebore for the purpose of experiment. There followed violent symptoms\r\nof gastric irritation, vomiting, and diarrhœa, but he also\r\nrecovered.[532]\r\n\r\n[532] _Med. Times and Gazette_, Jan. 3, 1863.\r\n\r\nCasper relates the poisoning of a whole family by veratrum; from the\r\nstomach of the mother (who died) and the remains of the repast (a\r\nporridge of lentils) veratrine was separated.\r\n\r\nFaber[533] recorded the poisoning of thirty cows by veratrum; eight\r\ndied, and it is noteworthy that violent poisonous symptoms were produced\r\nin animals partaking of their flesh and milk.\r\n\r\n[533] _Zeitschr. f. Staatsarzneik._, 1862.\r\n\r\n§ 483. The symptoms appear soon after the ingestion, and consist of a\r\nfeeling of burning in the mouth, spreading downwards to the stomach,\r\nincreased secretion of saliva, and difficulty of swallowing; then follow\r\nviolent vomiting and diarrhœa, with great pain in the bowels, often\r\ntenesmus; there is also headache, giddiness, a feeling of anxiety, and\r\nthe pupils are dilated. The consciousness is ordinarily intact; the\r\npulse is weak and slow, and the breathing embarrassed; the skin is\r\nbenumbed. There may be also formicating feelings, and twitchings in the\r\nmuscles with occasionally the tetanic cramps, which are constantly seen\r\nin frogs. In cases which end fatally, the disturbance of the breathing\r\nand circulation increases, and death takes place in collapse.\r\n\r\nAn important case of slow poisoning is on record,[534] in which two\r\nbrothers, aged twenty-one and twenty-two years, died after nine and\r\neleven weeks of illness, evidently from repeated small doses of the\r\npowder of _Veratrum album_. They became very weak and thin, suffered\r\nfrom diarrhœa and bloody stools, sleeplessness, disturbance of the\r\nintellect, and delirium.\r\n\r\n[534] Nivet and Géraud, _Gaz. Hebdom._, 1861.\r\n\r\n§ 484. The _post-mortem_ signs do not appear distinctive; even in the\r\ncase just mentioned--in which one would expect to find, at all events,\r\nan extensive catarrh of the intestinal canal--the results seem to have\r\nbeen negative.\r\n\r\n§ 485. =Separation from Organic Matters.=--The method of Stas (by which\r\nthe organic matters, whether the contents of the stomach or the tissues,\r\nare treated with alcohol, weakly acidified by tartaric acid) is to be\r\nrecommended. After filtering, the alcoholic extract may be freed from\r\nalcohol by careful distillation, and the extract taken up with water. By\r\nnow acidifying gently the watery extract, and shaking it up with ether\r\nand chloroform, fatty matters, resinous substances, and other\r\nimpurities, are removed, and it may then be alkalised by soda or potash,\r\nand the veratrine extracted by ether. The residue should be identified\r\nby the hydrochloric acid and by the sulphuric acid and bromine\r\nreactions; care should also be taken to ascertain whether it excites\r\nsneezing.\r\n\r\nA ptomaine, discovered by Brouardel,[535] was described by him as both\r\nchemically and physiologically analogous to veratrine. A. M.\r\nDeleziniere[536] has since investigated this substance. Only when in\r\ncontact with air does the analogy to veratrine obtain, and Deleziniere,\r\nto ascertain its reactions, studied it when in an atmosphere of\r\nnitrogen. It appears to be a secondary monamine, C₃₂H₃₁N, and is in the\r\nform of a colourless, oily liquid, with an odour like that of the\r\nhawthorn. It is insoluble in water, but alcohol, ether, toluene, and\r\nbenzene dissolve it readily. It oxidises in the presence of air. The\r\nsalts are deliquescent.\r\n\r\n[535] _Moniteur Scient._ (3), 10, 1140.\r\n\r\n[536] _Bull. Soc. Chim._ (3), 1, 178-180.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.--Physostigmine.\r\n\r\n§ 486. The ordeal bean of Calabar (_Physostigma faba_) is a large, all\r\nbut tasteless, kidney-shaped bean, about an inch in length, and half an\r\ninch thick; its convex edge has a furrow with elevated ridges, and is\r\npierced by a small hole at one extremity. The integuments are\r\ncoffee-brown in colour, thin, hard, and brittle; they enclose two white\r\ncotyledons, easily pulverisable, and weighing on an average 3·98 grms.\r\n(61 grains). The seed contains at least one alkaloid, termed\r\n_Physostigmine_ (first separated in 1864 by Jobst and Hesse), and\r\npossibly a second, according to Harnack and Witkowsky, who have\r\ndiscovered in association with physostigmine a new alkaloid, which they\r\ncall _Calabarine_, and which differs from physostigmine in being\r\ninsoluble in ether and soluble in water. It is also soluble in alcohol;\r\nand further, the precipitate produced by potassium iodo-hydrargyrate in\r\ncalabarine solutions is insoluble in alcohol.\r\n\r\n§ 487. =Physostigmine=, or =eserine=, is not easily obtained in a\r\ncrystalline state, being most frequently extracted as a colourless\r\nvarnish, drying into brittle masses. It is, however, quite possible to\r\nobtain it in the form of partially-crystalline crusts, or even rhombic\r\nplates, by care being taken to perform the evaporation, and all the\r\noperations, at as low a temperature as possible, and preferably in a\r\ndimly-lit room; for, if the temperature rises to 40°, much of the\r\nalkaloid will be decomposed. Hesse recommends that the beans be\r\nextracted, alcohol by the alcoholic solution alkalised by sodic\r\ncarbonate, and the liquid shaken up with ether, which will retain the\r\nalkaloid. The ether solution is now separated, and acidified slightly\r\nwith very dilute sulphuric acid; the fluid, of course, separates into\r\ntwo layers, the lower of which contains the alkaloid as a sulphate, the\r\nupper is the ether, which is withdrawn, and the acid fluid passed\r\nthrough a moist filter. The whole process is then repeated as a\r\npurification.\r\n\r\nAgain, Vee, who has repeatedly obtained the alkaloid in a crystalline\r\ncondition, directs the extraction of the beans by alcohol, the alcoholic\r\nsolution to be treated as before with sodic carbonate, and then with\r\nether; the ethereal solution to be evaporated to dryness, dissolved in\r\ndilute acid, precipitated by sugar of lead, and the filtrate from this\r\nprecipitate alkalised by potassic bicarbonate, and then shaken up with\r\nether. The ethereal solution is permitted to evaporate spontaneously,\r\nthe crystalline crusts are dissolved in a little dilute acid, and the\r\nsolution is lastly alkalised by potassic bicarbonate, when, after a few\r\nminutes, crystalline plates are formed.\r\n\r\nThe formula ascribed to physostigmine is C₁₅H₂₁N₃O₂. It is strongly\r\nalkaline, fully neutralising acids and forming tasteless salts. It is\r\neasily melted, and perhaps partly decomposed, at a temperature of 45°;\r\nat 100° it is certainly changed, becoming of a red colour, and forming\r\nwith acids a red solution. It dissolves easily in alcohol, ether,\r\nchloroform, and bisulphide of carbon, but is not easily soluble in\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThe salts formed by the alkaloid with the acids are generally\r\nhygroscopic and uncrystallisable, but an exception is met with in the\r\nhydrobromide, which crystallises in stellate groups.[537] If CO₂ is\r\npassed into water containing the alkaloid in suspension, a clear\r\nsolution is obtained; but the slightest warmth decomposes the soluble\r\nsalt and reprecipitates the alkaloid. The hydrarg-hydroiodide\r\n(C₁₅H₂₁N₃O₂,HI,2HgI) is a white precipitate, insoluble in water,\r\nbecoming yellow on drying, soluble in ether and alcohol, and from such\r\nsolutions obtained in crystalline prismatic groups. A heat of 70° melts\r\nthe crystals, and they solidify again in the amorphous condition.\r\n\r\n[537] M. Duquesnel, _Pharm. J. Trans._ (3), v. 847.\r\n\r\nIt gives a precipitate with gold chloride, reducing the gold; also one\r\nwith mercuric chloride easily soluble in hydrochloric acid. It gives no\r\nprecipitate with platinum chloride.\r\n\r\n§ 488. =Tests.=--Da Silva’s[538] test for eserine is as follows:--A\r\nminute fragment of eserine or one of its salts is dissolved in a few\r\ndrops of fuming nitric acid; this makes a yellow solution, but\r\nevaporated to complete dryness it is pure green. The green substance,\r\ncalled by others chloreserine, dissolves to a non-fluorescent green\r\nsolution; in water and also in strong alcohol it shows a band in the red\r\nbetween λ670 and λ688, a broader but more nebulous band in the blue and\r\nviolet between λ400 and λ418, and a very feeble band in the orange.\r\n\r\n[538] S. J. Ferreira da Silva, _Compt. Rend._, cxvii. 330, 331.\r\n\r\nJ. B. Nagelvoort[539] has recommended the following tests:--(_a_) An\r\namorphous residue of a permanent blue colour is obtained if a trace of\r\nthe alkaloid, or one of its salts, is evaporated in the presence of an\r\nexcess of ammonia; this blue alkaloid dissolves in dilute acids with a\r\nred colour; sensitiveness 0·00001 gm. (1 : 100000). The solution has\r\nbeautiful red fluorescence in reflected light; when evaporated, it\r\nleaves a residue that is green at first, changing to blue afterwards,\r\nthe blue residue being soluble in water, alcohol, and chloroform, but\r\nnot in ether. Chloroform extracts the blue colour from the watery\r\nammoniacal solution only partially. The blue solutions are reddened at\r\nfirst by H₂S, and discoloured afterwards. The blue colour is restored by\r\nexpelling the H₂S on the water-bath. (_b_) A red fluid is obtained when\r\n0·010 gm. eserine or its salicylate, 0·050 gm. of slacked lime, and 1\r\nc.c. of water are added together. Warmed in a water-bath, it turns\r\ngreen, and a piece of red litmus-paper suspended in the test-tube turns\r\nblue; a glass rod moistened with HCl gives off the well-known white\r\nclouds characteristic of an ammonia reaction. The green solution does\r\nnot lose its colour by evaporation. Baryta water, added to an eserine\r\nsolution, gives a white precipitate that turns red when strongly\r\nagitated, sensitive to 0·01 mgrm. (1 : 100000).\r\n\r\n[539] _Flückiger’s Reactions_, 1893.\r\n\r\n§ 489. =Pharmaceutical Preparations.=--The only preparations officinal\r\nin this country are a spirituous extract (_Extractum physostigmatis_),\r\nused principally for external application, the dose of which is not more\r\nthan 18·1 mgrms. (·18 grain), and gelatine discs for the purpose of the\r\nophthalmic surgeon, each disc weighing about 1/50th grain, and\r\ncontaining 1/1000 gr. of the alkaloid.\r\n\r\n§ 490. =Effects on Animals.=--A large number of experiments have been\r\nmade upon animals with physostigmine, most of them with the impure\r\nalkaloid, which is a mixture of calabarine and physostigmine. Now, the\r\naction of calabarine seems to be the opposite to that of\r\nphysostigmine--that is, it causes tetanus. Hence, these experiments are\r\nnot of much value, unless the different proportions of the alkaloids\r\nwere known. Harnack and Witkowsky[540] made, however, some researches\r\nwith pure physostigmine, of which the following are the main\r\nresults:--The smallest fatal dose for rabbits is 3 mgrms. per kilo.;\r\ncats about the same; while dogs take from 4 to 5 mgrms. per kilo. Frogs,\r\nunder the influence of the alkaloid, lie paralysed without the power of\r\nspontaneous movement, and the sensibility is diminished; later, the\r\nbreathing ceases, and the reflex irritability becomes extinguished. The\r\nactivity of the heart is through ·5 mgrm. slowed, but at the same time\r\nstrengthened.\r\n\r\n[540] _Arch. f. Pathol. u. Pharm._, 1876, Bd. v.\r\n\r\nThe warm-blooded animals experimented upon show rapid paralysis of the\r\nrespiratory centre, but the animal by artificial respiration can be\r\nsaved. Fibrillar muscular twitching of all the muscles of the body are\r\nobserved. Death follows in all cases from paralysis of the respiration.\r\nExperiments (first by Bexold, then by Fraser and Bartholow, and lastly\r\nby Schroff) have amply shown that atropine is, to a certain extent, an\r\nantidote for physostigmine poisoning. Fraser also maintains an\r\nantagonism between strychnine and physostigmine, and Bennet that chloral\r\nhydrate is antagonistic to physostigmine.\r\n\r\n=Effects on Man.=--The bean has long been used by the superstitious\r\ntribes of the West Coast of Africa as an ordeal, and is so implicitly\r\nbelieved in that the innocent, when accused of theft, will swallow it,\r\nin the full conviction that their innocency will protect them, and that\r\nthey will vomit up the bean and live. In this way, no doubt, life has\r\noften been sacrificed. Christison experimented upon himself with the\r\nbean, and nearly lost his life. He took 12 grains, and was then seized\r\nwith giddiness and a general feeling of torpor. Being alarmed at the\r\nsymptoms, he took an emetic, which acted. He was giddy, faint, and\r\nseemed to have lost all muscular power; the heart and pulse were\r\nextremely feeble, and beat irregularly. He afterwards fell into a sleep,\r\nand the next day he was quite well.\r\n\r\nIn August 1864 forty-six children were poisoned at Liverpool by eating\r\nsome of the beans, which had been thrown on a rubbish heap, being part\r\nof the cargo of a ship from the West Coast of Africa. A boy, aged six,\r\nate six beans, and died. In April of the same year, two children, aged\r\nsix and three years, chewed and ate the broken fragments of one bean;\r\nthe usual symptoms of gastric irritation and muscular weakness followed,\r\nbut both recovered. Physostigmine contracts the iris to a point; the\r\naction is quite local, and is confined to the eye to which it is\r\napplied. When administered internally, according to some, it has no\r\neffect on the eyes, but according to others, it has a weak effect in\r\ncontracting the pupil. In any case, the difference of opinion shows that\r\nthe effect, when internally administered, is not one of a marked\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n§ 491. =Physiological Action.=--The physiological action of\r\nphysostigmine is strikingly like that of nicotine, which it resembles in\r\nbeing a respiratory poison, first exciting, afterwards paralysing the\r\nvagus. Like nicotine, also, it produces a great loss of muscular power;\r\nit first excites, and then paralyses the intra-muscular terminations of\r\nthe nerves; and, again, like nicotine, it induces a tetanus of the\r\nintestine. A difference between physostigmine and nicotine exists in the\r\nconstant convulsive effects of the former, and in the greater influence\r\non the heart of the latter.\r\n\r\n§ 492. =Post-mortem Appearances.=--But little is known relative to the\r\n_post-mortem_ appearances likely to be found in human poisoning; redness\r\nof the stomach and intestines is probably the chief sign.\r\n\r\n§ 493. =Separation of Physostigmine.=--For the extraction of\r\nphysostigmine from the fluids of the body, Dragendorff recommends\r\nbenzene: the alcoholic filtered extract (first acidified) may be\r\nagitated with such solvents as petroleum and benzene, in order to remove\r\ncolouring matter; then alkalised and shaken up with benzene, and the\r\nlatter allowed to evaporate spontaneously--all the operations being, as\r\nbefore stated, carried on under 40°. If much coloured, it may be\r\npurified according to the principles before mentioned. In cases where\r\nenough of the extract (or other medicinal preparation) has been taken to\r\ndestroy life, the analyst, with proper care, would probably not have\r\nmuch difficulty in separating a small quantity of the active principle.\r\nIt is rapidly eliminated by the saliva and other secretions. In most\r\ncases it will be necessary to identify physostigmine by its\r\nphysiological activity, as well as by its chemical characters. For this\r\npurpose a small quantity of the substance should be inserted in the eye\r\nof a rabbit; if it contains the alkaloid in question, in twenty minutes,\r\nat the very latest, there will be a strong contraction of the pupil, and\r\na congested state of the conjunctival vessels. Further researches may be\r\nmade with a small quantity on a bird or frog. The chief symptoms\r\nobserved will be those of paralysis of the respiratory and voluntary\r\nmuscles, followed by death. If a solution is applied to the web of a\r\nfrog’s foot, the blood-vessels become dilated. Physostigmine appears,\r\naccording to Dragendorff and Pander, to act as an irritant, for they\r\nalways observed gastro-enteritis as a result of the poison, even when\r\ninjected subcutaneously. The enhanced secretion from all mucous\r\nsurfaces, and the enlargement of the blood-vessels, are also very\r\nconstant symptoms. But of all these characteristics, the contraction of\r\nthe pupil is, for the purposes of identification, the principal. A\r\nsubstance extracted from the tissue or other organic matters, in the\r\nmanner mentioned, strongly contracting the pupil and giving the bromine\r\nreaction, would, in the present state of our knowledge, be indicative of\r\nphysostigmine, and of that alone.\r\n\r\n§ 494. =Fatal Dose of Physostigmine.=--One mgrm. (·015 grain) as\r\nsulphate, given by Vee to a woman subcutaneously, caused vomiting, &c.,\r\nafter half an hour. A disciple of Gubler’s took 2 mgrms. without\r\napparent effect; but another mgrm., a little time after, caused great\r\ncontraction of the pupil and very serious symptoms, which entirely\r\npassed off in four hours. It would thus seem that three times this\r\n(_i.e._, 6 mgrms.) would be likely to be dangerous. If so, man is far\r\nmore sensitive to physostigmine than dogs or cats; and 3 mgrms. per\r\nkilo.--that is, about 205 mgrms. (3 grains)--would be much beyond the\r\nleast fatal dose.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.--Pilocarpine.\r\n\r\n§ 495. From the leaves of the jaborandi, _Pilocarpus pennatafolius_\r\n(Nat. Ord. _Rutaceæ_), two alkaloids have been separated--_jaborandi_\r\nand _pilocarpine_.\r\n\r\n=Jaborandi= (C₁₀H₁₂N₂O₃) is a strong base, differing from pilocarpine in\r\nits sparing solubility in water, and more ready solubility in ether; its\r\nsalts are soluble in water and alcohol, but do not crystallise. P.\r\nGhastaing,[541] by treating pilocarpine with a large quantity of nitric\r\nacid, obtained nitrate of jaborandi, and operating in the same way with\r\nhydrochloric acid, obtained the hydrochlorate of jaborandi; hence, it\r\nseems that jaborandi is derived from pilocarpine.\r\n\r\n[541] _Compt. Rend._, vol. xciv. p. 223.\r\n\r\n§ 496. =Pilocarpine= (C₁₁H₁₆N₂O₂) is a soft gelatinous mass, but it\r\nforms with the mineral acids crystallisable salts. The solutions are\r\ndextra-rotatory. On boiling with water, it decomposes into\r\ntrimethylamine and m-pyridine lactic acid,\r\n\r\n                                    CH₃\r\n                                  /\r\n  C₁₁H₁₆N₂O₂ + H₂O = N(CH₃)₃ + C₅H₄NCHO      :\r\n                                  \\\r\n                                    COOH\r\n\r\nhence it is a pyridine derivative, and its graphic formula probably\r\n\r\n        CO--O\r\n        |\r\n  C₅H₄N--C--N(CH₃)₃\r\n        |\r\n        CH₃\r\n\r\nThe nitrate and hydrochloride are at present much used in pharmacy.\r\nPilocarpine gives a precipitate with phosphomolybdic acid,\r\npotassio-mercuric iodide, and most general alkaloidal reagents, but none\r\nthat are very distinctive. When a solution of gold chloride is added to\r\none of pilocarpine, a salt falls, having the composition C₁₁H₁₆N₂O₂,HCl\r\n+ AuCl₃. It is not very soluble in water (about 1 in 4600), and has been\r\nutilised for the estimation of pilocarpine. Pilocarpine fused with\r\npotash yields trimethylamine, carbon dioxide, butyric, and traces of\r\nacetic acid. Pilocarpine dissolves without the production of colour in\r\nsulphuric acid; but, with bichromate of potash and sulphuric acid, a\r\ngreen colour is produced. It may be extracted from an aqueous solution\r\nmade alkaline by ammonia, by shaking up with chloroform or benzene.\r\n\r\n§ 497. =Tests.=--When a little of the alkaloid is mixed with ten times\r\nits weight of calomel, and rubbed, and moistened by the breath, the\r\ncalomel is blackened; cocaine also acts similarly; but the two could not\r\nbe mistaken for each other. If a solution of mercur-potassium iodide is\r\nadded to a solution of the hydrochloride, the amorphous precipitate\r\nbecomes, in the course of a day or two, oily drops. “A solution of\r\niodine in potassium iodide gives in pilocarpine solutions a brown\r\nprecipitate that often crystallises to feathery brown crystals\r\n(microscopically), and of serrated form, something like the blade of a\r\nscroll-saw, when the crystallisation is incomplete.”--_Flückiger’s\r\nReactions._\r\n\r\n§ 498. =Effects.=--Pilocarpine, given subcutaneously in doses of about\r\n32 mgrms. (½ grain), causes within five minutes a profuse perspiration\r\nand salivation, the face becomes flushed, and the whole body sweats; at\r\nthe same time, the buccal secretion is so much increased that in a few\r\nhours over a pint may be secreted. The tears, the bronchial secretion,\r\nand the intestinal secretions are also augmented; there are generally\r\nheadache and a frequent desire to pass water; the pulse is much\r\nquickened, and the temperature falls from 1°·4 to 4°: the symptoms last\r\nfrom two to five hours. Langley has shown that the over-action of the\r\nsubmaxillary gland is not affected by section either of the _chorda\r\ntympani_ or of the sympathetic supplying the gland. Although pilocarpine\r\nquickens the pulse of man, it slows, according to Langley,[542] the\r\nheart of the warm-blooded animals, and that of the frog. With regard to\r\nthe frog, Dr. S. Ringer’s researches are confirmatory. With large doses\r\nthe heart stops in diastole. If to the heart thus slowed, or even when\r\nrecently stopped, a minute quantity of atropine be applied, it begins to\r\nbeat again. There is also a most complete antagonism between atropine\r\nand pilocarpine in other respects, atropine stopping the excessive\r\nperspiration, and relieving the headache and pain about the pubes, &c.\r\nPilocarpine, given internally, does not alter the size of the pupil,\r\nbut the sight may, with large doses, be affected. If a solution is\r\napplied direct to the eye, then the pupil contracts. No fatal case of\r\nits administration has occurred in man. The probable dangerous dose\r\nwould be about 130 mgrms. (2 grains) administered subcutaneously.\r\nPilocarpine must be classed among the heart poisons.\r\n\r\n[542] “The Action of Jaborandi on the Heart,” by J. N. Langley, B.A.,\r\n_Journ. Anat. and Physiol._, vol. x. p. 187.\r\n\r\n\r\nX.--Taxine.\r\n\r\n§ 499. =Properties of Taxine.=--The leaves and berries, and probably\r\nother portions of the yew tree (_Taxus baccata_), are poisonous. The\r\npoison is alkaloidal, and was first separated by Marmé.\r\n\r\n=Taxine= (C₃₇H₅₂O₁₀N).--Taxine cannot be obtained in crystals, but as a\r\nsnow-white amorphous powder, scarcely soluble in water, but dissolving\r\nin alcohol, in ether, and in chloroform; insoluble in benzene. It melts\r\nat 82°, gives an intense purple-red, with sulphuric acid, and colours\r\nFröhde’s reagent reddish-violet.\r\n\r\nA slightly acid aqueous solution of the alkaloid gives precipitates with\r\nall the group reagents and with picric acid.\r\n\r\nThe salts are soluble in water; the hydrochloride may be obtained by\r\npassing gaseous HCl into anhydrous ether. The platinichloride forms a\r\nyellow micro-crystalline powder (C₃₇H₅₂O₁₀N)₂H₂PtCl₆. The salts are\r\ngenerally difficult to crystallise.[543]\r\n\r\n[543] A. Hilger and F. Brande, _Ber._, xxiii. 464-468.\r\n\r\n§ 500. =Poisoning by Yew.=--Falck has been able to collect no less than\r\n32 cases of poisoning by different parts of the yew--9 were from the\r\nberries, and the rest from the leaves. They were all accidental; 20\r\npersons died, or 62·5 per cent.\r\n\r\n§ 501. =Effects on Animals--Physiological Action.=--From the researches\r\nof Marmé-Borchers, it appears that taxine acts upon the nervous\r\ncentres--the nervous trunks themselves and the muscles remaining with\r\ntheir excitability unimpaired, even some time after death. Taxine kills\r\nthrough paralysis of the respiration, the heart beating after the\r\nbreathing has stopped. The leaves contain much formic acid, and their\r\nirritant action on the intestine is referred to this cause.\r\n\r\n§ 502. =Effects on Man.=--Several deaths from yew have resulted in\r\nlunatic asylums from the patients chewing the leaves. For example, a few\r\nyears ago, at the Cheshire County Asylum, a female, aged 41, was\r\nsuddenly taken ill, apparently fainting, her face pale, her eyes shut,\r\nand pulse almost imperceptible. Upon the administration of stimulants,\r\nshe somewhat revived, but in a little while became quite unconscious.\r\nThe pupils were contracted, and there were epileptiform convulsions,\r\nsucceeded by stertorous breathing. These convulsions returned from time\r\nto time, the action of the heart became weaker, and there was a\r\nremarkable slowing of the respirations, with long intervals between the\r\nbreathing. The woman died within an hour from the time when her illness\r\nwas first observed, and within two hours of eating the leaves. Yew\r\nleaves were found in her stomach. In another case that occurred at the\r\nParkside Asylum,[544] the patient died suddenly in a sort of epileptic\r\nfit. Yew leaves were again found in the stomach. In a case quoted by\r\nTaylor, in which a decoction of the leaves was drunk by a girl, aged 15,\r\nfor the purpose of exciting menstruation, she took the decoction on four\r\nsuccessive mornings. Severe vomiting followed, and she died eight hours\r\nafter taking the last dose. In another case there were also no symptoms\r\nexcept vomiting, followed by rapid death. Mr. Hurt, of Mansfield, has\r\nrecorded a case of poisoning by the berries. The child died in\r\nconvulsions before it was seen by any medical man.\r\n\r\n[544] _Pharm. Journ._ (3), No. 294.\r\n\r\nFrom these and other recorded cases, the symptoms seem generally to be a\r\nquick pulse, fainting or collapse, nausea, vomiting, convulsions, slow\r\nrespiration, and death, as a rule sudden and unexpected. We may suppose\r\nthat the sudden death is really due to a rapid paralysis of the\r\nrespiration, and suffocation.\r\n\r\n§ 503. =Post-Mortem Appearances.=--In the case of the girl who drank the\r\ndecoction, nothing unusual was observed in the stomach or organs of the\r\nbody; but when the leaves have been eaten, usually more or less\r\ncongestion of the mucous membrane of the stomach, as well as of the\r\nbowels, is apparent. In the case of the child who ate the berries\r\n(Hurt’s case), the stomach was filled with mucous and half-digested pulp\r\nof the berries and seeds. The mucous membrane was red in patches and\r\nsoftened, and the small intestines were also inflamed.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.--Curarine.\r\n\r\n§ 504. Commercial curare is a black, shining, resinoid mass, about 83\r\nper cent. of which is soluble in water, and 79 in weak spirit. It is a\r\ncomplicated mixture of vegetable extracts, from which, however, a\r\ndefinite principle possessing basic characters (_curarine_) has been\r\nseparated.\r\n\r\nThe extract is an arrow poison[545] prepared by different tribes of\r\nIndians in South America, between the Amazon and the Orinoco;\r\ntherefore, samples are found to vary much in their poisoning properties,\r\nalthough it is noticeable that qualitatively they are the same, and\r\nproduce closely analogous symptoms. It is supposed that some of the\r\ncurare is derived from different species of strychnos. This is the more\r\nprobable, because, as before stated, the South American strychnines\r\nparalyse, and do not tetanise. It is not unlikely that the active\r\nprinciples of curare (or woorari) may be methyl compounds similar to\r\nthose which have been artificially prepared, such as methyl strychnine\r\nand methyl brucine, both of which have a curare-like action.\r\n\r\n[545] A constituent of the Borneo arrow poison is “derrid,” a toxic\r\nprinciple obtained from a leguminous plant, the _Derris elliptica_; it\r\nis a resinous substance, which has not yet been obtained in the pure\r\nstate. It is said not to be a glucoside, nor to contain any nitrogen\r\n(Greshoff, _Ber._, xxiii. 3537-3550).\r\n\r\nThe Comalis on the east coast of Africa prepare an arrow poison from the\r\naqueous extract of the root of Oubaion, a tree closely related to\r\n_Carissa Schimperii_.\r\n\r\nOubain is prepared by treating the aqueous extract with lead acetate,\r\ngetting rid of excess of lead by SH₂, and concentrating in a vacuum. The\r\nsyrup is boiled with six times its volume of alcohol of 85°, and allowed\r\nto cool in shallow vessels; crystals are obtained which are\r\nrecrystallised, first from alcohol, and afterwards from water.\r\n\r\nOubain, C₃₀H₄₆O₁₂, forms thin white nacreous lamellæ. It is tasteless,\r\nodourless, and neutral, almost insoluble in cold water, and soluble in\r\nboiling water; it dissolves readily in moderately concentrated alcohol,\r\nis almost insoluble in absolute alcohol, and insoluble in ether and\r\nchloroform. Its melting-point is 200°. The solution of oubain in water\r\nis lævorotatory [α]_{D} = -340. It is a glucoside, yielding on boiling\r\nwith dilute acids a sugar. It is very poisonous; 2 mgrms. will kill a\r\ndog of 12 kilos. weight in a few minutes, if subcutaneously injected;\r\nbut, taken by the stomach, it produces no effect.--Arnaud, _Compt.\r\nRend._, cvi. 1011-1014.\r\n\r\n=Curarine= was first separated by Preyer in a crystalline form in 1865.\r\nHe extracted curare with boiling alcohol, to which a few drops of soda\r\nsolution had been added, evaporated off the alcohol, took up the extract\r\nwith water, and, after filtration, precipitated by phosphomolybdic acid,\r\nwhich had been acidified with nitric acid. The precipitate was dried up\r\nwith baryta water, exhausted with boiling alcohol, and curarine\r\nprecipitated from the alcoholic solution by anhydrous ether. It may also\r\nbe obtained by precipitating with mercuric chloride solution, and\r\nthrowing out the mercury afterwards by means of hydric sulphide, &c.\r\n\r\nCurarine, when pure, forms colourless, four-sided, very hygroscopic\r\nprisms of bitter taste, and weakly alkaline reaction; soluble in water\r\nand alcohol in all proportions, but with difficulty soluble in amyl\r\nalcohol and chloroform, and not at all in anhydrous ether, bisulphide of\r\ncarbon, or benzene. The base forms crystallisable salts with\r\nhydrochloric, nitric, and acetic acids. Curarine strikes a purple colour\r\nwith strong nitric acid. Concentrated solutions of curarine mixed with\r\ndilute glycerin, give an amorphous precipitate with potassic bichromate,\r\nand the precipitate treated with sulphuric acid strikes a beautiful blue\r\ncolour. Curarine chromate is distinguished from strychnine chromate by\r\nits amorphous character, and by its comparatively easy solubility. If\r\nthe chromates of strychnine and curarine be mixed, and the mixed\r\nchromates be treated with ammonia, strychnine will be precipitated, and\r\ncurarine pass into solution, thus forming a ready method of separating\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n§ 505. =Physiological Effects.=--According to Voisin and Liouville’s\r\nexperiments, subcutaneous injections of curare on man cause, in small\r\ndoses, strong irritation at the place of application, swelling, and\r\npain. The temperature of the body is raised from 1° to 2°, and the\r\nnumber of respirations increased from 4 to 8 per minute. The pulse\r\nbecomes somewhat stronger and more powerful. The urine is increased, and\r\ncontains sugar. Large doses administered to warm-blooded animals cause,\r\nafter a short time, complete paralysis of voluntary motion and of reflex\r\nexcitability, and the animal dies in asphyxia, the heart continuing to\r\nbeat.\r\n\r\nThis state is best produced for the purpose of experiment on frogs, and,\r\nindeed, is the best test for the poison. A very minute dose injected\r\nbeneath the skin of a frog soon paralyses both the voluntary and\r\nrespiratory muscles; the animal continues to breathe by the skin; the\r\nheart beats normally, or, perhaps, a little weakly, and the frog may\r\nremain in this motionless condition for days and yet recover. Only\r\ncurare and its congeners have this effect. By tying the femoral artery\r\nof one of the frog’s legs before administering the poison, an insight\r\ninto the true action of the drug is obtained. It is then found that the\r\nreflex excitability and power of motion in the leg are retained,\r\nalthough all the rest of the body is paralysed. The only explanation of\r\nthis is that curare does not act centrally, but paralyses the\r\nintramuscular ends of the motor nerves. Curare is eliminated partly\r\nthrough the liver and partly through the kidneys. Dragendorff found it\r\nin the fæces, while a striking proof that it is excreted by the kidneys\r\nis given by the experiment of Bidder,[546] in which the urine of a frog\r\npoisoned by curare was made to poison a second, and the urine of the\r\nsecond, a third. The easy excretion of curare through the kidneys\r\nfurnishes an explanation of the relatively large dose of curare which\r\ncan be taken by the stomach without injury. A dose which, given by\r\nsubcutaneous injection, would produce violent symptoms, perhaps death,\r\nmay yet be swallowed, and no ill effects follow. It is hence presumed\r\nthat, in the first case, the poison is, comparatively speaking, slowly\r\nabsorbed, and almost as fast separated, and put, as it were, outside the\r\nbody by going into the urine; while, in the other case, the whole dose\r\nis thrown suddenly into the circulation.\r\n\r\n[546] _Arch. f. Anat. u. Physiol._, 1879, p. 598.\r\n\r\n§ 506. =Separation of Curarine.=--It is hardly probable that the\r\ntoxicologist will have to look for curarine, unless it has entered the\r\nbody by means of a wound or by subcutaneous injection; so that in all\r\ncases the absorbed poison alone must be sought for. The seat of entry,\r\nthe liver, the kidneys, and the urine are the only parts likely to be of\r\nany use. Dragendorff recommends the extraction of the tissues with water\r\nfeebly acidulated with a mineral acid, to precipitate albuminous\r\nmatters, &c., by strong alcohol, and separate, by means of benzene,\r\nfatty matters. The liquid is then made alkaline, and shaken up with\r\npetroleum ether, which removes certain alkaloidal matters. It is now\r\nevaporated to dryness, mixed with finely-powdered glass, and extracted\r\nwith absolute alcohol. The alcohol is evaporated to dryness, and any\r\ncurarine extracted from this residue with water. By very careful drying\r\nup of this last extract, and taking it up in alcohol, the alkaloid is\r\nsaid to be obtained so pure as to respond to chemical tests. The\r\nidentification may be by the colour reaction of sulphuric acid described\r\n_ante_, in all cases supplemented by its physiological action on\r\nfrogs.[547]\r\n\r\n[547] It is known that curare may cause slight symptoms of excitation\r\nbefore the paralysis comes on. M. Couty has succeeded in isolating these\r\nsymptoms by employing feeble extracts of _Strychnos triplinervia_, or\r\nsmall doses of certain native preparations. By these means, in dogs, a\r\nnew phase of intoxication may be present for ten or even twenty minutes.\r\nIn the first instance the animal is agitated, jumping, scratching,\r\nbarking, as if in a state of general hyperæsthesia. Then it presents\r\nhalf choreic shocks or tremors; the pupils dilate, and are alternately\r\ndilated and contracted. The heart’s action is increased or diminished in\r\nfrequency; sometimes there is vomiting, micturition, or defecation; and\r\nthere is always salivation. Finally, the central and peripheral\r\ntemperature are raised, and the excitability of the muscles and nerves\r\nbecomes highly increased. With the native preparation of curare, it is\r\nimpossible to prolong this stage, and symptoms of paralysis soon become\r\nassociated with those of excitement. The choreic shocks were found to be\r\narrested by section of the sciatic nerve. Other experiments proved that\r\nthe spasms originated from the spinal cord, and were influenced by its\r\npreceding functional condition. If the cord was tied in the mid-dorsal\r\nregion, and the curare injected, the spasms were still produced in the\r\nhind legs; but if, after the operation, the excitability of the\r\nposterior segment became lowered, the spasm was no longer produced in\r\nthe hind legs. This dependence on a perfect functional activity is a\r\npoint of difference of these spasms from those produced by strychnine,\r\nand by asphyxia. The action of small doses of curare is not, however,\r\nlimited to the spinal cord. The diminished frequency of the heart\r\ncontinues after section of the pneumogastrics, and will even occur if\r\nthe pneumogastrics have been previously divided. From these facts M.\r\nCouty considers that curare must not be regarded as entirely destitute\r\nof a “convulsant” action, nor of an action on the central nervous\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.--Colchicine.\r\n\r\n§ 507. The whole of the _Colchicum autumnale_, or common meadow-saffron,\r\nis poisonous, owing to the presence of an alkaloid (discovered by\r\nPelletier and Caventou) called _Colchicine_.\r\n\r\nAccording to Johannson’s experiments, the dried colchicum seeds contain\r\n1·15 per cent. of colchicine; the leaves, 1·459 per cent.; the bulbs,\r\nfrom 1·4 to 1·58 per cent.; and the roots, 0·634 per cent. The frequent\r\npoisoning of cattle in the autumn by colchicum, its use in quack pills\r\nfor rheumatism, and its supposed occasional presence in beer, give it\r\nan analytical importance.\r\n\r\n§ 508. =Colchicine= (C₂₂H₂₅NO₆) may be extracted from the seeds, &c., in\r\nthe manner recommended by Hübler:--The seeds are treated, without\r\ncrushing, by hot 90 per cent. alcohol, and the alcoholic solution\r\nevaporated to a syrup, which is diluted with twenty times its bulk of\r\nwater and filtered; the liquid is next treated with acetate of lead,\r\nagain filtered, and the lead thrown out by phosphate of soda. Colchicine\r\nis now precipitated as a tannate.[548] The precipitation is best\r\nfractional, the first and last portions being rejected as containing\r\nimpurities. The tannate is decomposed in the usual way with litharge and\r\nextracted by alcohol.\r\n\r\n[548] The purest tannic acid must be used. The commercial tannin may be\r\npurified by evaporating to dryness with litharge, exhausting the tannate\r\nof lead repeatedly with boiling alcohol and water, and, lastly,\r\nsuspending in water, and separating the lead by SH₂.\r\n\r\nA simpler method is, however, extraction by chloroform from an aqueous\r\nsolution, feebly acidified, as recommended by Dragendorff. The parts of\r\nthe plant are digested in very dilute acid water, and the resulting\r\nsolution concentrated and shaken up with chloroform, which is best done\r\nin a separating tube.\r\n\r\nColchicine contains four methoxyl groups, and its constitutional formula\r\nis considered to be C₁₅H₉[NH(CH₃CO)](COOCH₃)(OCH₃)₃.\r\n\r\nIts melting-point is 143°-147°. It is usually a white, gummy mass. It is\r\neasily soluble in cold water, in alcohol, and in chloroform. The\r\nsolutions are lævorotatory. It is hardly soluble in ether. Boiling with\r\ndilute acids or alkalies in closed tubes yields colchiceine.\r\n\r\nColchiceine contains three methoxyl groups. It melts at 150°, dissolves\r\nbut little in cold, copiously in boiling water. Colchiceine appears to\r\nbe an acid, forming salts with the alkalies.\r\n\r\nZeisel[549] has formed acetotrimethylcolchicinamide\r\n(NHAcC₁₅H₉(OMe)₃CONH₃) by heating colchicine with alcoholic ammonia in\r\nclosed tubes for four hours at 100°. The amide is crystallised from hot\r\nalcohol; it is readily soluble in dilute HCl, almost insoluble in water;\r\nwhen a strong hydrochloric acid solution of the amide is treated with a\r\nsmall amount of potassium nitrite a splendid violet colour is produced.\r\n\r\n[549] _Monatsh._, ix. 1-30.\r\n\r\n§ 509. =Tests.=--Ferric chloride, if added to an alcoholic solution of\r\nthe alkaloid, strikes a garnet red; if to an aqueous solution a green or\r\nbrownish-green; nitric acid added to the solid substance gives a violet\r\ncolour. Erdmann’s reagent (nitrosulphuric acid) gives in succession\r\ngreen, dark blue, and violet colours, ultimately turning yellow,\r\nchanged, on addition of an alkali, to raspberry-red. Mandelin’s reagent\r\n(1 grm. of ammonium vanadate in 200 grms. of sulphuric acid) gives a\r\ngreen colour.\r\n\r\n§ 510. =Pharmaceutical Preparations.=--Colchicine itself is officinal in\r\nAustria--the wine in the British, French, and Dutch, and the seeds\r\nthemselves in all the pharmacopœias. The wine of colchicum, officinal in\r\nnearly all the pharmacopœias, is made with very different proportions of\r\nseeds or bulbs.\r\n\r\nThe tincture of colchicum is officinal in our own and in all the\r\nContinental pharmacopœias; in the British, one part of seeds is\r\nexhausted by eight parts of proof spirit.\r\n\r\nA tincture of colchicum seeds, examined by Johannson, contained ·18 per\r\ncent. of colchicine, and a tincture prepared from the bulbs ·14 per\r\ncent.\r\n\r\nColchicum vinegar is not officinal in Britain, but one containing 5·4\r\nper cent. of acetic acid is so in the Netherlands, Germany, and France;\r\nthe strength appears to be about ·095 per cent. of colchicine.\r\n\r\nAn extract of colchicum is officinal in Britain and France; and an\r\nacetic extract in Britain. The latter is the most active of all the\r\npharmaceutical preparations of colchicum.\r\n\r\nLastly, an oxymel of colchicum is in use in Germany, France, and the\r\nNetherlands.\r\n\r\n=Quack and Patent Medicines.=--In all specifics for gout the analyst\r\nwill naturally search for colchicum. Most gout pills contain the\r\nextracts; and liquids, such as “Reynolds’ gout specific,” the wine or\r\nthe tincture, variously flavoured and disguised.\r\n\r\nThe strength of the different pharmaceutical preparations may be\r\nascertained by dissolving in chloroform, evaporating off the chloroform,\r\ndissolving in water (which is finally acidified by from 7 to 10 per\r\ncent. of sulphuric acid), and titrating with Mayer’s reagent (see p.\r\n263). If the solution is diluted so that there is about one part of\r\ncolchicine in 600 of the solution, then each c.c. of Mayer’s reagent\r\nequals 31·7 mgrms. colchicine.\r\n\r\n§ 511. =Fatal Dose.=--In Taylor’s _Principles of Medical Jurisprudence_\r\nis mentioned an instance in which 3½ drachms of colchicum wine, taken in\r\ndivided doses, caused death on the fourth day. The quantity of the\r\nactive principle in the colchicum wine, as found by Johannson\r\n(_Dragendorff_), being 0·18 per cent., it follows that 24·4 mgrms. (·378\r\ngrain) were fatal, though not given as one dose, so that this quantity\r\nmay be considered as the least fatal one. Casper puts the lethal dose of\r\ncolchicine at from 25 to 30 mgrms. (·385 to ·463 grain). It is, however,\r\nincontestable that there are cases of recovery from as much as 70 mgrms.\r\n(1·08 grain). The lethal dose of the pharmaceutical preparations of\r\ncolchicum may, on these grounds, be predicted from their alkaloidal\r\ncontents, and, since the latter is not constant, in any medico-legal\r\ninquiry, it may be necessary, where facility is given, to ascertain the\r\nstrength of the preparation administered.\r\n\r\n§ 512. =Effects of Colchicine on Animals.=--The researches of Rossbach\r\nshow that the carnivoræ are more sensitive to colchicine than any other\r\norder of mammals. Frogs show a transitory excitement of the nervous\r\nsystem, then there is loss of sensation, paralysis of motion, and of the\r\nrespiratory apparatus; the heart beats after the respiration has ceased.\r\nDeath follows from paralysis of the respiration. The mucous membrane of\r\nthe intestine is much congested and swollen.\r\n\r\nI have seen cattle die from the effects of eating the meadow-saffron;\r\nthe animals rapidly lose condition, suffer great abdominal pain, and are\r\ngenerally purged. The farmers, in certain parts of the country, have had\r\nextensive losses from want of care and knowledge with regard to\r\ncolchicum poisoning.\r\n\r\n§ 513. =Effects of Colchicum on Man.=--Colchicum poisoning in man[550]\r\nis not very common: 2 deaths (accidental) are recorded in England and\r\nWales during the ten years ending 1892. F. A. Falck was able to collect\r\nfrom medical literature, prior to 1880, 55 cases, and he gives the\r\nfollowing analysis of the cases:--In 2, colchicum was taken for suicidal\r\npurposes; of the unintentional poisonings, 5 were from too large a\r\nmedicinal dose of colchicum wine, syrup, or extract, given in cases of\r\nrheumatism; in 13 cases, colchicum was used as a purgative; 42 cases\r\nwere owing to mistaking different preparations for drinks, or\r\ncordials--the tincture in 5, and the wine in 14, being taken instead of\r\norange tincture, quinine wine, schnapps or Madeira; in 1 case the corms\r\nwere added to mulled wine, in another, the leaves consumed with salad;\r\nin 16 cases (all children), the seeds of colchicum were eaten. Forty-six\r\nof the 55 died--that is, 83·7 per cent.\r\n\r\n[550] For the curious epidemic of diarrhœa which broke out in the Rhone\r\nGorge in 1785, and was referred to colchicine, see “Foods,” p. 287.\r\n\r\nIn the remarkable trial at the Central Criminal Court, in 1862, of\r\nMargaret Wilson (_Reg._ v. _Marg. Wilson_), who was convicted of the\r\nmurder of a Mrs. Somers, the evidence given rendered it fairly probable\r\nthat the prisoner had destroyed four people at different dates by\r\ncolchicum. The symptoms in all four cases were--burning pain in the\r\nthroat and stomach, intense thirst, violent vomiting and purging,\r\ncoldness and clamminess of the skin, excessive depression, and great\r\nweakness. One victim died on the second day, another on the fifth, a\r\nthird on the eighth, and the fourth on the fourteenth day. Schroff\r\nwitnessed a case in which a man took 2 grms. (nearly 31 grains) of the\r\ncorms; in one and a half hours he experienced general _malaise_; on the\r\nnext day there were flying muscular pains, which at length were\r\nconcentrated in the diaphragm, and the breathing became oppressed;\r\nthere was also pain in the neighbourhood of the duodenum, the abdomen\r\nwas inflated with gas; there was a sickly feeling and faintness. Then\r\ncame on a sleepy condition, lasting several hours, followed by fever,\r\nwith excessive pain in the head, noises in the ears, and delirium; there\r\nwas complete recovery, but the abdomen continued painful until the fifth\r\nday.\r\n\r\nIn another instance, a gentleman, aged 50,[551] had taken twenty-eight\r\nof Blair’s gout-pills in four and a half days for the relief of a\r\nrheumatic affection. He suffered from nausea, griping pains in the\r\nbelly, considerable diarrhœa, vomiting, and hiccough; towards the end\r\nthere was stupor, convulsive twitchings of the muscles, paralysis, and\r\ndeath. The fatal illness lasted fourteen days; he was seen by three\r\nmedical men at different dates--the first seems to have considered the\r\ncase one of diarrhœa, the second one of suppressed gout; but Dr. C. Budd\r\nwas struck with the similarity of the symptoms to those from an acrid\r\npoison, and discovered the fact that the pills had been taken. These\r\npills I examined; they were excessively hard, and practically consisted\r\nof nothing else than the finely-ground colchicum corms; six pills\r\nyielded 8 mgrms. of colchicine, so that the whole twenty-eight would\r\ncontain 39 mgrms. (⅗ grain). Dr. Budd considered that the whole of the\r\npills, which were of a stony hardness, remained in the bowels for some\r\ntime undigested, so that the ultimate result was the same as if the\r\nwhole had been taken in one dose.\r\n\r\n[551] See _Lancet_, vol. i., 1881, p. 368.\r\n\r\n§ 514. The general symptoms produced by colchicum are--more or less\r\nburning pain in the whole intestinal tract, vomiting, diarrhœa, with not\r\nunfrequently bloody stools; but sometimes diarrhœa is absent. In single\r\ncases tenesmus, dysuria, and, in one case, hæmaturia have been noted.\r\nThe respiration is usually troubled, the heart’s action slowed, the\r\npulse small and weak, and the temperature sinks. In a few cases there\r\nhave been pains in the limbs; cerebral disturbance is rare; but in two\r\ncases (one described _ante_) there was stupor. Muscular weakness has\r\nbeen observed generally. In a few cases there have been cramps in the\r\ncalves and in the foot, with early collapse and death.\r\n\r\n=Post-mortem Appearances.=--Schroff found in rabbits poisoned with from\r\n·1 to 1·0 grm. of colchicine, tolerably constantly enteritis and\r\ngastritis, and always a thick, pitch-like blood in the heart and veins.\r\nCasper has carefully recorded the _post-mortem_ appearances in four\r\nlabourers, ages ranging from fifteen to forty years, who, finding a\r\nbottle of colchicum-wine, and supposing it to be some kind of brandy,\r\neach drank a wine-glassful. They all died from its effects. In all four\r\nthere was great hyperæmia of the brain membranes and of the kidneys. The\r\nlarge veins were filled with thick, dark, cherry-red blood, very similar\r\nto that seen in sulphuric acid poisoning. There was an acid reaction of\r\nthe contents of the stomach. The lungs were moderately congested. The\r\nmucous membrane of the stomach of the one who died first was swollen and\r\nscarlet with congestion; with the second there was some filling of the\r\nvessels at the small curvature; while the stomachs of the third and\r\nfourth were quite normal. In 5 cases described by Roux there was also\r\nhyperæmia of the brain and kidneys, but no gastritis or enteritis. It\r\nis, therefore, evident that there are in man no constant pathological\r\nchanges from colchicine poisoning.\r\n\r\n§ 515. =Separation of Colchicine from Organic Matters.=--W.\r\nObolonski[552] has recommended the following process:--The finely\r\ndivided viscera are triturated with powdered glass and digested for\r\ntwelve hours with alcohol. The liquid is squeezed out and the dry\r\nresidue washed with alcohol. The extract is concentrated at a\r\ntemperature not exceeding 80°, and the cooled residue made up to the\r\noriginal volume with alcohol. The filtered liquid is evaporated as\r\nbefore, and this operation repeated until no more clots separate on\r\naddition of water. The residue is then dissolved in water, the solution\r\npurified by shaking with light petroleum, and the colchicine finally\r\nextracted with chloroform.\r\n\r\n[552] _Zeit. anal. Chem._, xxix. 493.\r\n\r\nIn cases of poisoning by colchicum at Berlin, Wittstock used the\r\nfollowing process:--The contents of the stomach were mixed with a large\r\namount of alcohol, a few drops of HCl added, and the whole well shaken;\r\nthe fluid was then filtered, and the filtrate evaporated to a syrupy\r\nconsistence at 37°. The resulting residue was dissolved in distilled\r\nwater, the fat, &c., filtered off, and the liquid carefully evaporated.\r\nFrom the extract foreign matter was again separated by treatment with\r\nalcohol and filtration, and the last filtrate was evaporated to a syrupy\r\nconsistence. The syrupy fluid was taken up by distilled water, filtered,\r\nevaporated to 30 grms., and 2 grms. of calcined magnesia with 90 grms.\r\nof ether were added. After a time, the ether was removed, and allowed to\r\nevaporate spontaneously. The residue was once more taken up with water,\r\nfiltered from fat, &c., and evaporated. This final residue gave all the\r\nreactions of colchicine. In medico-legal researches, it must be\r\nremembered that colchicine is absorbed but slowly, a not insignificant\r\nportion remaining in the bowels, with the fæces.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.--Muscarine and the Active Principles of Certain Fungi.\r\n\r\n§ 516. =The Amanita Muscaria=, or fly-blown agaric, is a very\r\nconspicuous fungus, common in fir-plantations, about the size and shape\r\nof the common mushroom; but the external surface of the pileus is of a\r\nbright red, or sometimes of a yellowish cast, and studded over with\r\nwarts. The common name of the fungus denotes that it was used in former\r\ntimes as a popular insecticide; the fungus was bruised, steeped in milk,\r\nand the milk exposed, in the same way as we now expose arsenical\r\nfly-papers.\r\n\r\nSome peculiar properties of the agaric have long been known to the\r\nnatives of Kamschatka, and of the north-eastern part of Asia generally.\r\nThey collect the fungi in the hottest months, and hang them up to dry.\r\nThe fungus is then rolled up in a kind of bolus, and swallowed without\r\nchewing. One large, or two small, fungi will produce a kind of\r\nintoxication, which lasts a whole day. It comes on in about two hours’\r\ntime, and is very similar to that of alcohol. There is a giddy feeling,\r\nthe spirits are exalted, the countenance becomes flushed, involuntary\r\nactions and words follow, and sometimes loss of consciousness. It\r\nrenders some persons remarkably active, and proves highly stimulant to\r\nmuscular exertion; by too large a dose violent spasmodic effects are\r\nproduced. “So very exciting to the nervous system in many individuals is\r\nthis fungus, that the effects are often very ludicrous. If a person\r\nunder its influence wishes to step over a straw or small stick, he takes\r\na stride or a jump sufficient to clear the trunk of a tree. A talkative\r\nperson cannot keep silence or secrets, and one fond of music is\r\nperpetually singing. The most singular effect of the amanita is the\r\ninfluence which it has over the urine. It is said that from time\r\nimmemorial the inhabitants have known that the fungus imparts an\r\nintoxicating quality to that secretion, which continues for a\r\nconsiderable time after taking it. For instance, a man moderately\r\nintoxicated to-day will, by the next morning, have slept himself sober,\r\nbut (as is the custom) by taking a teacup of his urine he will be more\r\npowerfully intoxicated than he was the preceding day. It is, therefore,\r\nnot uncommon for confirmed drunkards to preserve their urine as a\r\nprecious liquor against a scarcity of the fungus. The intoxicating\r\nproperty of the urine is capable of being propagated; for every one who\r\npartakes of it has his urine similarly affected. Thus, with a very few\r\namanitas, a party of drunkards may keep up their debauch for a week. Dr.\r\nLangsdorf mentions that by means of the second person taking the urine\r\nof the first, the third of the second, and so on, the intoxication may\r\nbe propagated through five individuals.”[553]\r\n\r\n[553] Lindley’s _Vegetable Kingdom_.\r\n\r\n§ 517. A few cases of poisoning by the fly-blown agaric from time to\r\ntime have occurred in Europe, where it has been eaten in mistake for the\r\nedible fungi, or taken by children allured by the bright attractive\r\ncolours. In these cases the poisonous symptoms noticed have been those\r\nof gastro-intestinal irritation, as shown by vomiting and diarrhœa,\r\n_dilated_[554] pupils, delirium, tetanic convulsions, slow pulse,\r\nstertorous breathing, collapse, and death. In a few cases epileptic\r\nattacks and trismus have been observed. The course is usually a rapid\r\none, the death occurring within twelve hours. In cases of recovery,\r\nconvalescence has been prolonged.\r\n\r\n[554] This is the more curious, for muscarine strongly contracts the\r\npupil. It, however, tends to prove what is stated in the text--viz.,\r\nthat there is more than one poisonous substance in _Amanita_.\r\n\r\n=The post-mortem characteristics are not distinctive=, a fluid condition\r\nof the blood, hyperæmia of the brain, liver, and kidneys has been\r\nnoticed.\r\n\r\n§ 518. =Muscarine.=--These effects are partly due to an undiscovered,\r\ntoxic substance--which seems to be destroyed at the temperature of\r\nboiling water, and is probably of rather easy destructibility--and of a\r\nvery definite poisonous alkaloid (_muscarine_) first separated by a\r\ncomplex process by Schmiedeberg and Koppe in 1869.[555] It is a\r\ntrimethylammonium base, and has lately been formed synthetically by\r\nSchmiedeberg and Harnack,[556] by treating cholin with nitric acid.\r\nMuscarine is isomeric with betain and oxycholin, from which it is\r\nseparated by its fluorescence and poisonous properties.\r\n\r\n[555] _Das Muscarin, das giftige Alkaloid des Fliegenpilzes._ Leipzig,\r\n1869.\r\n\r\n[556] _Arch. f. exper. Path._, Bd. 4 u. 5.\r\n\r\nThe structural formula of muscarine, and its connection with choline, is\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n  CH₂OH\r\n  |\r\n  CH₂\r\n  |\r\n  N(CH₃)₃OH\r\n\r\n  _Choline._\r\n\r\n  CH₂OH\r\n  |\r\n  CHOH\r\n  |\r\n  N(CH₃)₃OH\r\n\r\n  _Muscarine._\r\n\r\n\r\nAn atom of hydrogen from the choline, CH₂, group, being replaced by\r\nhydroxyl.\r\n\r\nMuscarine is a colourless, strongly alkaline, syrupy fluid, which, if\r\nallowed to stand over sulphuric acid, becomes gradually crystalline, but\r\nliquefies again on exposure to the atmosphere. It dissolves in water in\r\nevery proportion, and also in alcohol, but is very little soluble in\r\nchloroform, and insoluble in ether. It is not precipitated by tannin: it\r\nforms salts with acids, and gives precipitates with auric chloride,\r\nphosphotungstic, and phosphomolybdic acids, and also with\r\npotassio-mercuric iodide. The last precipitate is at first amorphous,\r\nbut it gradually becomes crystalline. This was the compound used by the\r\ndiscoverers to separate the base. With many other general alkaloidal\r\nreagents muscarine forms no compound that is insoluble, and therefore\r\ngives no precipitate, such, _e.g._, as iodine with potassic iodide,\r\npicric acid, and platinic chloride. Muscarine is a stronger base than\r\nammonia, and precipitates copper and iron oxides from solutions of\r\ntheir salts. Muscarine is very poisonous; 2 to 4 mgrms. are sufficient\r\nin subcutaneous injection to kill cats in from two to twelve\r\nhours--larger doses in a few minutes; but with rabbits the action is\r\nless intense. Cats become salivated, their pupils contract, they vomit,\r\nand are purged, the breathing becomes frequent, and there is marked\r\ndyspnœa. At a later stage the respirations are slower, and there are\r\nconvulsions, and death.\r\n\r\nThe alkaloid has also been tried on man. Doses of from 3 to 5 mgrms.,\r\ninjected subcutaneously, cause, after a few minutes’ profuse salivation,\r\nincreased frequency of the pulse, nausea, giddiness, confusion of\r\nthought and myosis, but no vomiting, and no diarrhœa. Small quantities\r\napplied to the eye cause, after a few minutes, a derangement of the\r\naccommodation, but no change in the size, of the pupil; larger\r\nquantities cause also myosis, which depends upon an excitement of the\r\nsphincter iridis, or of the oculomotorius.\r\n\r\n§ 519. The actions of muscarine and atropine are to a great extent\r\nantagonistic. This is especially and beautifully demonstrated by the\r\neffects of the two substances on the frog’s heart. The action of\r\nmuscarine upon the heart is to excite the inhibitory nerve apparatus,\r\nwhile the action of atropine is to paralyse the same system. One mgrm.\r\nof muscarine, injected subcutaneously into a frog, arrests the heart _in\r\ndiastole_, but if a suitable dose of atropine is applied to the heart\r\nthus arrested, it begins to beat again; or, if atropine is first given,\r\nand then muscarine, the heart does not stop. The muscarine heart, when\r\nit has ceased to beat, may be successfully stimulated by galvanism.\r\nMuscarine at first excites the respiratory centre, and then paralyses\r\nit.\r\n\r\n§ 520. =Detection of Muscarine in the Body.=--Muscarine itself is not\r\nlikely to be taken as a poison or administered; but if it is sought for\r\nin the fly-blown agaric, or in the tissues or organs of persons who have\r\nbeen poisoned by the fungus, the process of Brieger appears the best.\r\nThe process depends upon the fact that muscarine gives a soluble\r\nmercuric chloride compound, and is not precipitated by chloride of\r\nplatinum, whilst most other substances accompanying it give more or less\r\ninsoluble precipitates. The substances are treated with water acidulated\r\nwith hydrochloric acid, and the acidulated extract concentrated (best in\r\na vacuum) to a syrup. The syrupy residue is now treated with water, and\r\nthe solution precipitated by means of mercuric chloride solution and any\r\nprecipitate filtered off; the filtrate is freed from mercury by SH₂, and\r\nevaporated to a syrup; the syrup is repeatedly extracted with alcohol,\r\nand the alcoholic solution precipitated with platinum chloride and any\r\nprecipitate filtered off. The filtrate is freed from alcohol, and all\r\nthe platinum thrown out of solution by SH₂; the aqueous filtrate is now\r\nconcentrated to a small volume, and again platinum chloride added, any\r\nprecipitate which forms is filtered off, and the final filtrate allowed\r\nto crystallise. If muscarine be present, a crystalline compound of\r\nmuscarine platinum chloride will form.\r\n\r\nThe crystals are usually octahedral in form, and have the composition\r\n(C₅H₁₄NO₂Cl)₂PtCl₄; the percentage of platinum is 30·41.\r\n\r\nIt would probably be necessary to identify farther, by the action of the\r\npoison on a frog.\r\n\r\n§ 521. =The Agaricus phalloides=, a common autumn fungus, has been\r\nseveral times mistaken for mushrooms, and has proved fatal; of some 53\r\ncases collected by Falck, no less than 40, or 75 per cent., were fatal;\r\nthe real mortality is much lower than this, for it is only such cases\r\nthat are pronounced and severe which are likely to be recorded. The\r\nfungus contains a toxalbumin which has been named “phallin.” The action\r\nof this toxalbumin is to dissolve the blood corpuscles; according to\r\nKobert, even one 250,000th dilution produces “polycholie,” with all its\r\nconsequences, such as the escape of hæmoglobin and its decomposition\r\nproducts in the blood and urine, multiple blood coagulation through the\r\nfibrin ferment becoming free, and serious cerebral disturbance. If into\r\na dog, cat, or rabbit, only 0·5 mgrm. of phallin be injected\r\nintravenously, within from twenty to thirty minutes blood from a vein\r\nshows that the serum has a red colour.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms in man first appear in from three to forty-eight hours;\r\nthere is mostly diarrhœa, violent vomiting, with cramp in the legs,\r\ncyanosis, and collapse. There are also nervous phenomena, convulsions,\r\ntrismus, and, in a few cases, tetanic spasms. The pulse, in seven cases\r\ndescribed by Maschka, was very small, thready, and quick, but in others,\r\nagain, small and slow. The pupils have in some cases been dilated, in\r\nothers unchanged. Death is generally rapid. In two of Maschka’s cases\r\nfrom sixty to sixty-eight hours after the investigation, but in the rest\r\nfrom twelve to eighteen hours. Life may, however, be prolonged for\r\nseveral days. In a case recorded by Plowright,[557] in which a boy had\r\neaten a piece of the pileus, death occurred on the fourth day.\r\n\r\n[557] _Lancet_, 1879.\r\n\r\n§ 522. =The post-mortem appearances= observed in Maschka’s seven cases\r\nwere--absence of cadaveric rigidity, dilatation of the pupil, a dark red\r\nfluid condition of the blood, numerous ecchymoses in the pleura, in the\r\nsubstance of the lungs, the pericardium, the substance of the heart, the\r\nliver, kidneys, and spleen. The mucous membrane of the digestive canal\r\npresented nothing characteristic. In two cases there were a few\r\necchymoses, and in one the mucous membrane of the stomach was softened,\r\nred, and easily detached. In one case only were any remnants of the\r\nfungus found, by which the nature of the substance eaten could be\r\ndetermined. The bladder in each case was full. In three cases a fatty\r\ndegeneration of the liver had commenced. The same appearance was met\r\nwith in some of the older cases related by Orfila.\r\n\r\n§ 523. =The Agaricus pantherinus= is said to be poisonous, although\r\nHertwig found it to have no action when given to dogs.\r\n\r\n=The Agaricus ruber=, a bright-hued fungus, growing profusely on the\r\nHampshire coast, of a purple-red colour--the colouring-matter not only\r\ncovering the pileus, but also extending down the stipe--is poisonous,\r\nand has recently been chemically investigated by Phipson,[558] who has\r\nidentified a colouring-matter _ruberine_, and an alkaloid _agarythrine_.\r\nAgarythrine is separated by macerating the fungus (from which the skin\r\ncontaining the colouring-matter has been removed) as completely as\r\npossible in water acidulated with 8 per cent. of hydrochloric acid. The\r\nfiltered solution is neutralised by sodic carbonate, and the alkaloid\r\nshaken up with ether. On evaporation the ether leaves a white, somewhat\r\ngreasy-looking substance, having a bitter burning taste, and easily\r\nfusible into yellow globules, giving forth an odour like quinoleine; it\r\nis soluble in alcohol and ether. From Phipson’s observations it would\r\nappear probable that the red colouring-matter is derived from a\r\ndecomposition of this alkaloidal substance. A rose-red colour is\r\nproduced by the action of nitric acid, and chlorinated lime first\r\nreddens and then bleaches it. Buchwald[559] has recorded three cases of\r\npoisoning by this fungus; the patients were labourers, who, after eating\r\nthe fungus, suffered from vomiting, thirst, a “drunken” condition,\r\ncramp, albuminuria, and disturbance of the sensory functions. The fungus\r\ncauses in cats myosis, but is said not to affect rabbits.\r\n\r\n[558] _Chem. News_, p. 199, 1882.\r\n\r\n[559] _Industr. Bl._, 1876.\r\n\r\n§ 524. =The Soletus satanas, or luridus= (=Lenz=), is poisonous; very\r\nsmall quantities of the uncooked fungus caused in Lenz, who experimented\r\nupon its properties, violent vomiting. In cases in which this fungus has\r\nbeen eaten accidentally, the symptoms have been very similar to cholera.\r\n\r\n§ 525. =The Common Morelle= seems under certain conditions to be\r\npoisonous. From six to ten hours after ingestion there have appeared\r\ndepression, nausea, jaundice, dilated pupils, and in the worst cases at\r\nthe end of the first day, delirium, somnolence, and muscular cramps,\r\nfollowed by collapse and death. In a case observed by Kromholz, the\r\n_post-mortem_ appearances were jaundice, a dark fluid state of the\r\nblood, and hyperæmia of the brain and liver. Boström fed a dog with 100\r\ngrms. of the fresh young morelle; the animal died on the third day, and\r\nthe canaliculi of the kidney were found filled with hæmoglobin, partly\r\namorphous, and partly crystalline.[560]\r\n\r\n[560] See Casper’s _Viertelj._, 1844; Keber, _Preuss. Vereinszeitg._\r\n1846; Boström, _Ber. d. Phys. Med. Soc._, Erlangen, 1880; Schauenstein,\r\n“Giftige Schwämme” in Maschka’s _Handbuch_, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIVISION II.--GLUCOSIDES.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--Digitalis Group.\r\n\r\n§ 526. =The Digitalis purpurea=, or foxglove, is a plant extremely\r\ncommon in most parts of England, and poisoning may occur from the\r\naccidental use of the root, leaves, or seeds. The seeds are very small\r\nand pitted; they weigh 1126 to a grain (_Guy_), are of a light brown\r\ncolour, and in form somewhat egg-shaped. The leaves are large, ovate,\r\ncrenate, narrowed at the base, rugous, veined, and downy, especially on\r\nthe under surface. Their colour is a dull green, and they have a faint\r\nodour and a bitter, nauseous taste. The leaf is best examined in\r\nsection. Its epidermis, when fresh, is seen to consist of transparent,\r\nhexagonal, colourless cells, beneath which, either singly or in groups,\r\nthere are round cells of a magenta tint, and beneath these again a layer\r\nof columnar cells, and near the lower surface a loose parenchyma. The\r\nhairs are simple, appearing scantily on the upper, but profusely on the\r\nlower, surface; each is composed of from four to five joints or cells,\r\nand has at its base a magenta-coloured cell. The small leaves just below\r\nthe seed-case, and the latter itself, are studded with glandular hairs.\r\nThe root consists of numerous long slender fibres.\r\n\r\n§ 527. =Chemical Composition.=--It is now generally accepted that there\r\nexist in the foxglove, at least, four distinct principles--_digitalin_,\r\n_digitonin_, _digitoxin_, and _digitalein_. Besides these there are\r\nseveral others of more or less definite composition, which are all\r\nclosely related, and may be derived from a complex glucoside by\r\nsuccessive removals of hydrogen in the form of water.\r\n\r\nThe following is the theoretical percentage composition of the\r\ndigitalins, the identity of which has been fairly established. They are\r\narranged according to their percentage in carbon:--\r\n\r\nTABLE SHOWING THE COMPOSITION OF THE DIGITALINS.\r\n\r\n  +------------------+--------+-------------------------------------+\r\n  |      Name.       |Formula.|    Percentage Composition.          |\r\n  +------------------+--------+-------------------------------------+\r\n  | Digitalein,      | C₂₁H₄₆O₁₁ | C. 53·16 per cent.

Digitogenin.   Dextrose.\r\n\r\n--_Ber._, xxiii. 1555-1568.\r\n\r\n    § 528. =Digitalein= is a colourless, amorphous body, easily soluble\r\n    in water and in cold absolute alcohol. It may be precipitated from\r\n    an alcoholic solution by the addition of much ether. It is with\r\n    difficulty soluble in chloroform, and insoluble in ether. It is\r\n    precipitated from a watery solution by tannin, or by basic lead\r\n    acetate; saponification by dilute acids splits it up into glucose\r\n    and digitaleretin. It has a sharp, acrid taste, and the watery\r\n    solution froths on shaking.\r\n\r\n    § 529, =Digitonin=, a white amorphous body, has many of the\r\n    characters of saponin. Like saponin, it is easily soluble in water,\r\n    and the solution froths, and, like saponin again, it is precipitated\r\n    by absolute alcohol, by baryta water, and by basic lead acetate. It\r\n    may be readily distinguished from saponin by treating a watery\r\n    solution with sulphuric or hydrochloric acid. On saponifying, it is\r\n    split up into digitogenin, galactose, and dextrose. On heating, a\r\n    beautiful red colour develops. It does not give the bromine\r\n    reaction.\r\n\r\n=Digitogenin= is insoluble in water and aqueous alkalies; it is somewhat\r\nsoluble in alcohol, chloroform, and glacial acetic acid; it forms a\r\ncrystalline compound with alcoholic potash, which is strongly alkaline,\r\nand not very soluble in alcohol.\r\n\r\n§ 530. =Digitalin=, when perfectly pure, forms fine, white, glittering,\r\nhygroscopic needles, or groups of crystalline tufts; it is without\r\nsmell, but possesses a bitter taste, which is at once of slow\r\ndevelopment and of long endurance. On warming, it becomes soft under\r\n100°, and, above that temperature, is readily decomposed with evolution\r\nof white vapours. It is insoluble in water, in dilute soda solution, in\r\nether, and in benzene. It is soluble in chloroform, especially in\r\nchloroform and alcohol, and dissolves easily in warm acetic acid; twelve\r\nparts of cold and six of boiling alcohol of 90 per cent. dissolve one of\r\ndigitalin. Dilute hydrochloric or sulphuric acid decompose it into\r\nglucose and digitaletin (C₄₄H₃₀O₁₈); if the action is prolonged,\r\ndigitaleretin (C₄₄H₃₈O₁₈), and finally dehydrated digitaleretin, are\r\nformed. Concentrated sulphuric acid dissolves it with the production of\r\na green colour, which by bromine passes into violet-red, but on the\r\naddition of water becomes green again. Hydrochloric acid dissolves it\r\nwith the production of a greyish-yellow colour, passing gradually into\r\nemerald green; water precipitates from this solution a resinous mass.\r\n\r\n    § 531. =Digitaletin.=--A substance obtained by Walz on treating his\r\n    digitalin by dilute acids. It is crystalline, and its watery\r\n    solution tastes bitter. It melts at 175°, and decomposes, evolving\r\n    an acid vapour at about 206°. It dissolves in 848 parts of cold, and\r\n    222 of boiling, water; in 3·5 parts of cold, and in from 2 to 4 of\r\n    boiling, alcohol. It is with difficulty soluble in ether. It\r\n    dissolves in concentrated sulphuric acid, developing a red-brown\r\n    colour, which, on the addition of water, changes to olive-green. On\r\n    boiling with dilute acids, it splits up into sugar and\r\n    digitaleretin.\r\n\r\n§ 532. =Digitoxin= always accompanies digitalin in the plant, and may by\r\nsuitable treatment be obtained in glittering needles and tabular\r\ncrystals. It is insoluble in water and in benzene. It dissolves with\r\nsome difficulty in ether, and is readily dissolved by alcohol or by\r\nchloroform. On boiling with dilute acids, it is decomposed into an\r\namorphous, readily soluble body,--_Toxiresin_. Digitoxin, according to\r\nSchmiedeberg, only exists in the leaves of the digitalis plant, and that\r\nin the proportion of 1 part in 10,000. Digitalin and digitoxin are _par\r\nexcellence_ the poisonous principles of the plant. Toxiresin is also\r\nintensely poisonous. It may be obtained in crystals by extracting the\r\ndry exhausted leaves with alcohol of 50 per cent., precipitating with\r\nlead acetate, and washing the precipitate first with a dilute solution\r\nof sodium carbonate (to remove colouring-matter), and then with ether,\r\nbenzene, and carbon disulphide, in all of which it is insoluble; on\r\ndecomposing the lead compound, digitoxin may be obtained in colourless\r\nscales or needle-shaped crystals.\r\n\r\n    § 533. =Digitaleretin=, the origin of which has been already alluded\r\n    to, is a yellowish-white, amorphous powder, possessing no bitter\r\n    taste, melting at 60°, soluble in ether or in alcohol, but insoluble\r\n    in water.\r\n\r\n    =Paradigitaletin= is very similar to the above, but it melts at\r\n    100°, and is insoluble in ether.\r\n\r\n§ 534. Several other derivatives have been obtained and described, such\r\nas the inert _digitin_, _digitalacrin_, _digitalein_, and others, but\r\ntheir properties are, as yet, insufficiently studied. Digitalin, as well\r\nas digitoxin, may now be obtained pure from certain firms, but the\r\nordinary digitalin of commerce is, for the most part, of two kinds,\r\nwhich may be distinguished as French and German digitalin. The French\r\ndigitalin, or the digitalin of Homolle, is prepared by treating an\r\naqueous extract of the digitalis plant with lead acetate, and freeing\r\nthe filtrate from lead, lime, and magnesia, by successive additions of\r\nalkaline carbonate, oxalate, and phosphate, and then precipitating with\r\ntannin. The tannin precipitate is treated with litharge, and the\r\ndigitalins boiled and extracted from the mass by means of alcohol, and\r\nlastly, purifying with animal charcoal. Crystals are in this way\r\nobtained, and by removing all substances soluble in ether by that\r\nsolvent, digitalin may be separated. The German digitalin is prepared\r\naccording to the process of Walz, and is extracted from the plant by\r\ntreatment with alcohol of ·852. The alcohol is removed by evaporation,\r\nand the alcoholic extract taken up with water; the watery extract is\r\ntreated with lead acetate and litharge, filtered, the filtrate freed\r\nfrom lead by hydric sulphate, and the excess of acid neutralised by\r\nammonia, and then tannin added to complete precipitation. The\r\nprecipitate is collected and rubbed with hydrated oxide of lead, and the\r\nraw digitalin extracted by hot alcohol. The alcohol, on evaporation,\r\nleaves a mixture of digitalin mixed with other principles and fatty\r\nmatter. If sold in this state, it may contain from 2 to 3 per cent. of\r\ndigitalein and digitonin. On treating the mixture with ether, digitalin\r\nwith some digitaletin is left behind, being almost insoluble in ether.\r\nSince, however, digitaletin is very insoluble in cold water, by\r\ntreating the mixture with eight parts of its weight of cold water,\r\ndigitalin is dissolved out in nearly a pure state. It may be further\r\npurified by treating the solution with animal charcoal,\r\nrecrystallisation from spirit, &c.\r\n\r\n§ 535. =Reactions of the Digitalins.=--Digitonin is dissolved by dilute\r\nsulphuric acid (1 : 3) without colour, and the same remark applies to\r\nhydrochloric acid; on warming with either of these acids, a violet-red\r\ncolour appears; this reaction thus serves to distinguish digitonin from\r\nthe three other constituents, as well as from saponin.\r\n\r\nSulphuric and gallic acids colour the glucosides of digitalin,\r\ndigitalein, and digitonin, red, but not digitoxin, which can be\r\nidentified in this way.\r\n\r\nSulphuric acid and bromine give with digitalin a red, and with\r\ndigitalein a violet coloration, which, on the addition of water, change\r\nrespectively into emerald and light green. This, the most important\r\nchemical test we possess, is sometimes called _Grandeau’s test_; it is\r\nnot of great delicacy, the limit being about ·1 mgrm.\r\n\r\n§ 536. =Pharmaceutical Preparations of Digitalin.=--Digitalin itself is\r\nofficinal in the French, Belgium, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and\r\nAustrian pharmacopœias. It is prepared in our own by making a strong\r\ntincture of the leaves at 120° F.; the spirit is then evaporated off,\r\nand the extract heated with acetic acid, decolorised by animal charcoal,\r\nand filtered. After neutralisation with ammonia, the digitalin is\r\nprecipitated with tannin, and the tannate of digitalin resolved into\r\ntannate of lead and free digitalin, by rubbing it with oxide of lead and\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\nDigitalis leaf is officinal in most of the pharmacopœias.\r\n\r\nTincture of digitalis is officinal in our own and all the Continental\r\npharmacopœias, and an ethereal tincture is used in France and Germany.\r\n\r\nAn _Acetum digitalis_ is officinal in the Netherlands and Germany; an\r\nextract and infusion are also used to some extent.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the nature of the active principle in these different\r\npreparations, according to Dragendorff, digitonin and digitalein are\r\nmost plentiful in the acetic and aqueous preparations; whilst in the\r\nalcoholic, digitalin, digitoxin, and digitalein are present.\r\n\r\nAccording to Schmiedeberg, commercial digitalin contains, in addition to\r\ndigitoxin, digitonin, digitalin, and digitalein; of these, digitonin is\r\ngreatest in amount.[562]\r\n\r\n[562] H. Kiliani, _Ber._, xxiii.\r\n\r\n§ 537. =Fatal Dose.=--The circumstance of commercial digitalin\r\nconsisting of varying mixtures of digitoxin, digitalin, and digitalein,\r\nrenders it difficult to be dogmatic about the dose likely to destroy\r\nlife. Besides, with all heart-poisons, surprises take place; and very\r\nminute quantities have a fatal result when administered to persons with\r\ndisease of the heart, or to such as, owing to some constitutional\r\npeculiarity, have a heart easily affected by toxic agents. Digitoxin,\r\naccording to Kopp’s[563] experiments, is from six to ten times stronger\r\nthan digitalin or digitalein. Two mgrms. caused intense poisonous\r\nsymptoms. Digitoxin is contained in larger proportions in Nativelle’s\r\ndigitalin than in Homolle’s, or in the German digitalin. The digitalin\r\nof Homolle is prescribed in 1 mgrm. (·015 grain) doses, and it is\r\nthought dangerous to exceed 6 mgrms.\r\n\r\n[563] _Archiv f. exp. Pathol. u. Pharm._, vol. iii. p. 284, 1875.\r\n\r\nLemaistre has, indeed, seen dangerous symptoms arise from 2 mgrms. (·03\r\ngrain), when administered to a boy fifteen years old. It may be\r\npredicated from recorded cases and from experiment, that digitoxin would\r\nprobably be fatal to an adult man in doses of 4 mgrms. (1/16 grain), and\r\ndigitalin, or digitalein, in doses of 20 mgrms. (·3 grain). With regard\r\nto commercial digitalin, as much as from 10 to 12 mgrms. (·15 to ·18\r\ngrain) have been taken without a fatal result; on the other hand, 2\r\nmgrms. gave rise to poisonous symptoms in a woman (Battaille). Such\r\ndiscrepancies are to be explained on the grounds already mentioned. It\r\nis, however, probable that 4 mgrms. (or 1/16 grain) of ordinary\r\ncommercial digitalin would be very dangerous to an adult.\r\n\r\nIt must also, in considering the dose of digitalin, be ever remembered\r\nthat it is a cumulative poison, and that the same dose--harmless if\r\ntaken once--yet, frequently repeated, becomes deadly: this peculiarity\r\nis shared by all poisons affecting the heart. When it is desired to\r\nsettle the maximum safe dose for the various tinctures, extracts, and\r\ninfusions of digitalis used in pharmacy, there is still greater\r\ndifficulty, a difficulty not arising merely from the varying strength of\r\nthe preparations, but also from the fact of the vomiting almost\r\ninvariably excited by large doses. Individuals swallow quantities\r\nwithout death resulting, simply because the poison is rapidly expelled;\r\nwhereas, if the œsophagus was ligatured (as in the experiments on the\r\nlower animals formerly favoured by the French school of toxicologists),\r\ndeath must rapidly ensue. The following table is a guide to the maximum\r\nsingle dose, and also the amount safe to administer in the twenty-four\r\nhours in divided doses. As a general rule, it may be laid down that\r\ndouble the maximum dose is likely to be dangerous:--\r\n\r\nTABLE SHOWING THE MAXIMUM SINGLE DOSE, AND MAXIMUM QUANTITY OF THE\r\nDIFFERENT PREPARATIONS OF DIGITALIS, WHICH CAN BE ADMINISTERED IN A DAY.\r\n\r\n  +----------------+----------------------+--------------------------+\r\n  |                |     Single Dose.     |         Per Day.         |\r\n  |                +----------+-----------+-------------+------------+\r\n  |                | Grains or|  Grammes  | Grains or   |Grammes     |\r\n  |                |  Minims. | or c.c’s. |  Minims.    |or c.c’s.   |\r\n  +----------------+----------+-----------+-------------+------------+\r\n  |Powdered Leaves,| 4½ grns. |  ·3 grm.  |  15·4 grns. |  1·0 grm.  |\r\n  |Infusion,       | 480 m.   |28·3 c.c.  | 1440 m.     | 84·9 c.c.  |\r\n  |Tincture,       |  45 m.   |   3 c.c.  |  135 m.     |    9 c.c.  |\r\n  |Digitalin,      | ·03 grn. |  ·002 grm.|   ·09 grn.  |  ·006 grm. |\r\n  |Extract,        |3·0   „   |  ·2    „  | 12·0 „      |  ·8    „   |\r\n  +----------------+----------+-----------+-------------+------------+\r\n\r\n§ 538. =Statistics.=--The main knowledge which we possess of the action\r\nof digitalis is derived from experiments on animals, and from occasional\r\naccidents in the taking of medicines; but in comparison with certain\r\ntoxic agents more commonly known, the number of cases of death from\r\ndigitalis is very insignificant. Of 42 cases of digitalis-poisoning\r\ncollected by Husemann, 1 was criminal (murder); 1 the result of\r\nmistaking the leaves for those of borage; 42 were caused in medicinal\r\nuse--in 33 of these last too large a dose had been given, in 3 the drug\r\nwas used as a domestic remedy, in 2 of the cases the prescription was\r\nwrongly read, and in 1 digitalis was used as a secret remedy. Twenty-two\r\nper cent. of the 45 were fatal.\r\n\r\n§ 539. =Effects on Man.=--It was first distinctly pointed out by Tardieu\r\nthat toxic doses of digitalis, or its active principles, produced not\r\nonly symptoms referable to an action on the heart, but also, in no small\r\ndegree, gastric and intestinal irritation, similar to that produced by\r\narsenic. Tardieu also attempted to distinguish the symptoms produced by\r\nthe pharmaceutical preparations of digitalis (the tincture, extract,\r\n&c.), and the glucoside digitalin; but there does not appear a\r\nsufficient basis for this distinction. The symptoms vary in a\r\nconsiderable degree in different persons, and are more or less tardy or\r\nrapid in their development, according to the dose. Moderate doses\r\ncontinued for some time (as, for example, in the persistent use of a\r\ndigitalis medicine) may produce their first toxic effects even at the\r\nend of many days; but when a single large dose is taken, the symptoms\r\nare rarely delayed more than three hours. They may commence, indeed, in\r\nhalf an hour, but have been known to be retarded for more than\r\ntwenty-four hours, and the longer periods may be expected if digitalis\r\nis given in hard, not easily soluble pills. There is commonly a feeling\r\nof general _malaise_, and then violent retching and vomiting. The pulse\r\nat first may be accelerated, but it soon is remarkably slowed--it sinks\r\ncommonly down to 50, to 40, and has even been known as low as 25. To\r\nthese symptoms, referable to the heart and to the digestive tract, are\r\nadded nervous troubles; there are noises in the ears, and disturbances\r\nof vision. In a case related by Taylor, a red-coal fire seemed to the\r\npatient to be of a blue colour; in another, related by Lersch,[564]\r\nthere was blindness for eighteen hours, and for some time a confusion in\r\nthe discrimination in colours; quiet delirium has also been noticed. As\r\nthe case proceeds, the gastric symptoms also increase in severity; the\r\ntongue Christison, in one case, noticed to be enormously swollen, and\r\nthe breath fœtid. Diarrhœa is commonly present, although also sometimes\r\nabsent. The action of the kidneys is suppressed. Hiccough and\r\nconvulsions close the scene.\r\n\r\n[564] _Rhen. West. Corr. Bl._, 15, 1848; Husemann in Maschka’s\r\n_Handbuch_.\r\n\r\nIn the cumulative form, the symptoms may suddenly burst out, and the\r\nperson pass into death in a fainting-fit without any warning. As a rare\r\neffect, hemiplegia may be mentioned.\r\n\r\nThis brief _résumé_ of the symptoms may be further illustrated by the\r\nfollowing typical cases:--A recruit, aged 22, desiring to escape from\r\nmilitary service, went to a so-called “_Freimacher_” who gave him 100\r\npills, of which he was to take eight in two doses daily. Eleven days\r\nafter the use of the pills, he became ill, and was received into\r\nhospital, where he suddenly died after three weeks’ treatment. His\r\nmalady was at first ascribed to gastric catarrh; for he suffered from\r\nloss of appetite, nausea, and constipation. He complained of pain in the\r\nhead, and giddiness. His breath smelled badly, and the region of the\r\nstomach was painful on pressure. The pulse was slow (56), the\r\ntemperature of the body normal. Towards the end, the pulse sank to 52;\r\nhe suffered from vomiting, noise in the ears, troubles of vision, great\r\nweakness, and later, hiccough and swelling in the neck. The mere act of\r\nstanding up in order to show his throat caused him to faint; on the same\r\nday on which this occurrence took place, he suddenly died on the way to\r\nthe nightstool. Thirteen of the pills were found in the patient’s\r\nclothes, and from a chemical and microscopical examination it was found\r\nthat they contained digitalis leaf in fine powder. The quantity which\r\nthe unfortunate man took in the four weeks was estimated at 13·7 grms.\r\n(= about 211 grains).\r\n\r\nTwo of his comrades had also been to the “_Freimacher_,” and had\r\nsuffered from the same symptoms, but they had left off the use of the\r\nmedicine before any very serious effect was produced.[565][566]\r\n\r\n[565] Köhnhorn, _Vierteljahrsschr. f. ger. Med._, 1876, n. F. xxiv. p.\r\n402.\r\n\r\n[566] There is an interesting case on record, in which a woman died from\r\nthe expressed juice of digitalis. She was twenty-seven years of age, and\r\ntook a large unknown quantity of the freshly expressed juice for the\r\npurpose of relieving a swelling of the limbs. The symptoms came on\r\nalmost immediately, she was very sick, and was attacked by a\r\nmenorrhagia. These symptoms continued for several days with increasing\r\nseverity, but it was not until the fifth day that she obtained medical\r\nassistance. She was then found semi-comatose, the face pale, pulse slow,\r\nepigastrium painful on pressure, diarrhœa, and hiccough were frequent.\r\nShe died on the twelfth day. The _post-mortem_ appearances showed\r\nnothing referable to digitalis save a few spots of inflammation on the\r\nstomach.--Caussé, _Bull. de Thérapeutique_, vol. lvi. p. 100; _Brit. and\r\nFor. Med. Chir. Review_, vol. xxvi., 1860, p. 523.\r\n\r\nAn instructive case of poisoning by digitoxin occurred in the person of\r\nDr. Koppe, in the course of some experiments on the drug. He had taken\r\n1·5 mgrm. in alcohol without result; on the following day (May 14) he\r\ntook 1 mgrm. at 9 A.M., but again without appreciable symptoms. Four\r\ndays later he took 2 mgrms. in alcoholic solution, and an hour\r\nafterwards felt faint and ill, with a feeling of giddiness; the pulse\r\nwas irregular, of normal frequency, 80 to 84. About three hours after\r\ntaking the digitoxin, Dr. Koppe attempted to take a walk, but the\r\nnausea, accompanied with a feeling of weakness, became so intense that\r\nhe was obliged to return to the house. Five hours after the dose, his\r\npulse was 58, intermittent after about every 30 to 50 beats. Vomiting\r\nset in, the matters he threw up were of a dark green colour; after\r\nvomiting he felt better for a quarter of an hour, then he again vomited\r\nmuch bilious matter; the pulse sank to 40, and was very intermittent,\r\nstopping after every 2 or 3 beats. Every time there was an intermission,\r\nhe felt a feeling of constriction and uneasiness in the chest. Six and a\r\nquarter hours after the dose there was again violent vomiting and\r\nretching, with paleness of the face. The muscular weakness was so great\r\nthat he could not go to bed without assistance. He had a disorder of\r\nvision, so that the traits of persons well-known to him were changed,\r\nand objects had a yellow tint. He had a sleepless night, the nausea and\r\nvomiting continuing. During the following day the symptoms were very\r\nsimilar, and the pulse intermittent, 54 per minute. He passed another\r\nrestless night, his short sleep being disturbed by terrible dreams. On\r\nthe third day he was somewhat better, the pulse was 60, but irregular\r\nand still intermittent; the nausea was also a little abated. The night\r\nwas similar in its disturbed sleep to the preceding. He did not regain\r\nhis full health for several days.[567]\r\n\r\n[567] _Arch. f. exp. Path. u. Pharm._, vol. iii. p. 289, 1875.\r\n\r\nA third case may be quoted, which differs very markedly from the\r\npreceding, and shows what a protean aspect digitalin poisoning may\r\nassume. A woman, twenty-three years old, took on June 26th, at 7 A.M.,\r\nfor the purpose of suicide, 16 granules of digitalin. Two hours later\r\nthere was shivering and giddiness, so that she was obliged to go to bed.\r\nIn the course of the day she had hallucinations. In the evening at 8\r\nP.M., after eating a little food, she had a shivering fit so violent\r\nthat her teeth chattered; there was cold sweat, and difficulty in\r\nbreathing; she became gradually again warm, but could not sleep. At 1\r\nA.M. the difficulty of breathing was so great that she dragged herself\r\nto the window, and there remained until 3 A.M., when she again went back\r\nto bed, slept until 7 A.M., and woke tolerably well. Since this attempt\r\nof self-destruction had failed, she took 40 granules. After one hour she\r\nbecame giddy, had hallucinations, chilliness, cold sweats, copious\r\nvomiting, and colicky pains; there was great muscular weakness, but no\r\ndiarrhœa. Towards evening the vomiting became worse. There was no action\r\nof the bowels, nor was any urine passed; she felt as if her eyes were\r\nprominent and large. The sufferings described lasted during the whole\r\nnight until five o’clock the following day, when the vomiting ceased,\r\nwhilst the hallucinations, chilliness, and cold sweat continued; and the\r\nthirst, sick feeling, and weakness increased. The next morning, a\r\nphysician found her motionless in bed, with pale face, notable double\r\nexophthalmus, dilated pupils, and cold skin, covered with sweat; the\r\npulse was small and intermittent, sometimes scarcely to be felt (46 to\r\n48 per minute); the epigastrium was painful on pressure. She passed this\r\nsecond night without sleep, and in the morning the pulse had risen from\r\n56 to 58 beats, but was not quite so intermittent. There was some action\r\nof the bowels, but no urine was passed, nor had any been voided from the\r\ncommencement; the bladder was not distended. The following (third) day\r\nsome red-coloured, offensive urine was passed; the skin was warmer, and\r\nthe pulse from 60 to 64, still somewhat intermittent--from this time she\r\nbegan to improve, and made a good recovery.[568]\r\n\r\n[568] Related by Ducroix: _De l’Empoisonnement par la Digitale et la\r\nDigitaline._ Paris, 1864.\r\n\r\n§ 540. =Physiological Action of the Digitalins.=--Whatever other\r\nphysiological action this group may have, its effect on the heart’s\r\naction is so prominent and decided, that the digitalins stand as a type\r\nof _heart poisons_. The group of heart poisons has been much extended of\r\nlate years, and has been found to include the following:--Antiarin, an\r\narrow poison; helleborin, a glucoside contained in the hellebore family;\r\na glucoside found in the _Apocynaceæ_, _Thevatii neriifolia_, and\r\n_Thevatia iccotli_; the poisonous principle of the _Nerium oleander_ and\r\n_N. odorum_; the glucoside of _Tanghinia venenifera_; convallamarin,\r\nderived from the species of _Convallaria_; scillotoxin, from the squill;\r\nsuperbin, from the Indian lily; and the alkaloid erythrophlœin from the\r\n_Erythrophlœum judiciale_ (see p. 432 _et seq._). This list is yearly\r\nincreasing.\r\n\r\n§ 541. =Local Action.=--The digitalins have an exciting or stimulating\r\naction if applied to mucous membranes--_e.g._, if laid upon the nasal\r\nmucous surface, sneezing is excited; if applied to the eye, there is\r\nredness of the conjunctivæ with smarting; if to the tongue, there is\r\nmuch irritation and a bitter taste. The leaves, the extract, and the\r\ntincture all have this directly irritating action, for they all redden\r\nand inflame mucous membranes.\r\n\r\n§ 542. =Action on the Heart.=--The earlier experimenters on the\r\ninfluence of digitalis on the heart were Stannius and Traube.\r\nStannius[569] experimented on cats, and found strong irregularity, and,\r\nlastly, cessation in diastole, in which state it responded no longer to\r\nstimuli. Rabbits and birds--especially those birds which lived on\r\nplants--were not so susceptible, nor were frogs.\r\n\r\n[569] _Arch. f. Physiol._\r\n\r\nTraube[570] made his researches on dogs, using an extract, and\r\nadministering doses which corresponded to from ·5 to 4·0 grms. He\r\ndivided the symptoms witnessed into four stages:--\r\n\r\n[570] _Ann. d. Charité-Krankenhauses_, vol. ii. p. 785.\r\n\r\n_1st Stage._--The pulse frequently diminishes, while the pressure of the\r\nblood rises.\r\n\r\n_2nd Stage._--Not seen when large doses are employed; pulse frequency,\r\nas well as blood pressure, abnormally low.\r\n\r\n_3rd Stage._--Pressure low, pulse beats above the normal frequency.\r\n\r\nThe slowing of the heart[571] is attributed to the stimulus of the\r\ninhibitory nerves, but the later condition of frequency to their\r\nparalysis. After the section of the vagi the slow pulse frequently\r\nremains, and this is explained by the inhibitory action of the cardiac\r\ncentre. The vagus, in point of time, is paralysed earlier than the\r\nmuscular substance of the heart.\r\n\r\n[571] Slowing of the pulse was mentioned first by Withering (_An Account\r\nof the Foxglove_, Lond., 1785). Beddoes afterwards observed that\r\ndigitalis increased the force of the circulation, the slowing of the\r\npulse not being always observed; according to Ackermann, if the\r\ninhibitory apparatus is affected by atropine, or if the patient is under\r\ndeep narcosis, the slowing is absent.\r\n\r\nThe increased blood pressure Traube attributed to increased energy of\r\nthe heart’s contraction, through the motor centre being stimulated\r\nlater; the commencing paralysis explains the abnormally low pressure.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, also an influence on vaso-motor nerves. What Dr.\r\nJohnson has described as the “stop-cock” action of the small arteries\r\ncomes into play, the small arteries contract and attempt, as it were, to\r\nlimit the supply of poisoned blood. Ackermann,[572] indeed, witnessed\r\nthis phenomenon in a rabbit’s mesentery, distinctly seeing the arteries\r\ncontract, and the blood pressure rise after section of the spinal cord.\r\nThis observation, therefore, of Ackermann’s (together with experiments\r\nof Böhm[573] and L. Brunton[574]) somewhat modifies Traube’s\r\nexplanation, and the views generally accepted respecting the cause of\r\nthe increased blood pressure may be stated thus:--The pressure is due to\r\nprolongation of the systolic stroke of the cardiac pump, and to the\r\n“stop-cock” action of the arteries; in other words, there is an increase\r\nof force from behind (_vis a tergo_), and an increased resistance in\r\nfront (_vis a fronte_).\r\n\r\n[572] _Deutsch. Arch. f. klin. Med._, vol. xix. p. 125.\r\n\r\n[573] _Archiv f. d. Ges. Phys._, vol. v. p. 153.\r\n\r\n[574] _On Digitalis, with Some Observations on the Urine_, Lond., 1868.\r\n\r\n§ 543. =Action of the Digitalins on the Muco-Intestinal Tract and other\r\nOrgans.=--In addition to that on the heart, there are other actions of\r\nthe digitalins; for example, by whatever channel the poison is\r\nintroduced, vomiting has been observed. Even in frogs this, in a\r\nrudimentary manner, occurs. The diuretic action which has been noticed\r\nin man is wanting in animals, nor has a lessened diminution of urea been\r\nconfirmed.\r\n\r\nAckermann found the temperature during the period of increased blood\r\npressure raised superficially, but lowered internally. According to\r\nBoeck[575] there is no increase in the decomposition of the albuminoids.\r\n\r\n[575] _Intoxication_, p. 404.\r\n\r\n    § 544. =The Action of Digitalin on the Common Blow-fly.=--The author\r\n    has studied the effects of digitalin, made up into a thin paste with\r\n    water, and applied to the head of the common blow-fly. There are at\r\n    once great signs of irritation, the sucker is extruded to its full\r\n    length, and the fly works its fore feet, attempting to brush or\r\n    remove the irritating agent. The next symptom is a difficulty in\r\n    walking up a perpendicular glass surface. This difficulty increases,\r\n    but it is distinctly observed that weakness and paralysis occur in\r\n    the legs before they are seen in the wings. Within an hour the wings\r\n    become paralysed also, and the fly, if jerked from its support,\r\n    falls like a stone. The insect becomes dull and motionless, and\r\n    ultimately dies in from ten to twenty-four hours. A dose, in itself\r\n    insufficient to destroy life, does so on repetition at intervals of\r\n    a couple of hours. The observation is not without interest, inasmuch\r\n    as it shows that the digitalins are toxic substances to the muscular\r\n    substance of even those life-forms which do not possess a heart.\r\n\r\n§ 545. =Action of the Digitalins on the Frog’s Heart.=--The general\r\naction of the digitalins is best studied on the heart of the frog. Drs.\r\nFagge and Stevenson have shown[576] that, under the influence of\r\ndigitalin, there is a peculiar form of irregularity in the beats of the\r\nheart of the frog; the ventricle ultimately stops in the white\r\ncontracted state, the voluntary power being retained for fifteen to\r\ntwenty minutes afterwards; in very large doses there is, however, at\r\nonce paralysis. Lauder Brunton[577] considers the action on the heart to\r\nessentially consist in the prolongation of the systole.\r\n\r\n[576] _Guy’s Hospl. Reports_, 3rd ver., vol. xii. p. 37.\r\n\r\n[577] _On Digitalis, with Some Observations on the Urine_, Lond., 1868.\r\n\r\nAtropine or curare have no influence on the heart thus poisoned. If the\r\nanimal under the influence of digitalin be treated with muscarine, it\r\nstops in diastole instead of systole. On the other hand, the heart\r\npoisoned by muscarine is relieved by digitalin, and a similar influence\r\nappears to be exercised by atropine. The systolic stillness of the\r\nheart is also removed by substances which paralyse the heart, as\r\ndelphinin, saponin, and apomorphin.\r\n\r\nLarge doses of digitalin, thrown suddenly on the circulation by\r\nintravenous injection, cause convulsions and sudden death, from quick\r\npalsy of the heart. With frogs under these circumstances there are no\r\nconvulsions, but a reflex depression, which, according to Weil[578] and\r\nMeihuizen,[579] disappears on decapitation. The central cerebral\r\nsymptoms are without doubt partly due to the disturbance of the\r\ncirculation, and there is good ground for attributing them also to a\r\ntoxic action on the nervous substance. The arteries are affected as well\r\nas the heart, and are reduced in calibre; the blood pressure is also\r\nincreased.[580] This is essentially due to the firm, strong contraction\r\nof the heart, and also to the “stop-cock” action of the small\r\narteries.[581]\r\n\r\n[578] _Archiv f. Anat. u. Physiol._, 1871, p. 282.\r\n\r\n[579] _Archiv f. d. Ges. Physiol._, vol. vii. p. 201.\r\n\r\n[580] The following is a brief summary of observations on the blood\r\npressure; four stages may be noticed--(1) Rise of normal blood pressure,\r\nnot necessarily accompanied with a diminution of pulse frequency; (2)\r\ncontinuation of heightened blood pressure, the pulse being raised beyond\r\nthe normal rate; (3) continued high pressure, with great irregularity of\r\nthe heart and intermittent pulse; (4) quick depression of pressure,\r\nsudden stopping of the heart, and death.\r\n\r\n[581] According to Boehm (_Arch. f. d. Ges. Physiol._, Bd. v. S. 189)\r\nand to Williams (_Arch. f. exper. Pathol._, Bd. xiii. S. 2), the rise of\r\npressure is due entirely to the heart, and not to the contractions of\r\nthe small arteries; but I fail to see how the small arteries can\r\ncontract, and yet not heighten the pressure.\r\n\r\n§ 546. =Post-mortem Appearances.=--In the case of the recruit poisoned\r\nby digitalis leaf (p. 425), the blood was found dark and fluid; the\r\nright ventricle and auricle of the heart were filled with blood, the\r\nleft empty; the brain and its membranes were anæmic; the stomach and\r\nmucous membrane of the intestines were in parts ecchymosed, and there\r\nwere patches of injection. In the case of the widow De Pauw, poisoned\r\nwith digitalin by the homœopath (Conty de la Pommerais), the only\r\nabnormality discovered was a few hyperæmic points in the mucous membrane\r\nof the stomach and small intestines. It is then certain that although\r\nmore or less redness of the lining membrane of the intestine track may\r\nbe present, yet, on the other hand, the active principle of the\r\ndigitalis may destroy life, and leave no appreciable sign.\r\n\r\n§ 547. =Separation of the Digitalins from Animal Tissues, &c.=--It is\r\nbest to make an alcoholic extract after the method of Stas, the alcohol\r\nbeing feebly acidulated by acetic acid, and all operations being carried\r\non at a temperature below 60°. The alcoholic extract is dissolved in\r\nwater feebly acidulated by acetic acid, and shaken up, first with\r\npetroleum ether to remove impurities (the ether will not dissolve any of\r\nthe digitalins), then with benzene, and, lastly, with chloroform. The\r\nbenzene dissolves digitalein, and the chloroform, digitalin and\r\ndigitoxin. On allowing these solvents to evaporate spontaneously,\r\nresidues are obtained which will give the reactions already detailed.\r\nNeither the bromine nor any other chemical test is sufficient to\r\nidentify the digitalins; it is absolutely necessary to have resource to\r\nphysiological experiment. The method used by Tardieu in the classical\r\nPommerais case may serve as a model, more especially the experiments on\r\nfrogs. Three frogs were properly secured, the hearts exposed, and the\r\nbeats counted. The number of beats was found to be fairly equal. Frog\r\nNo. 1 was placed under such conditions that the heart was constantly\r\nmoist. Frog No. 2 was poisoned by injecting into the pleura 6 drops of a\r\nsolution in which 10 mgrms. of digitalin were dissolved in 5 c.c. of\r\nwater. The third frog was poisoned by a solution of the suspected\r\nextract. The number of beats per minute were now counted at definite\r\nintervals of time as follows:--\r\n\r\nTABLE SHOWING THE ACTION OF DIGITALIN ON THE FROG’S HEART.\r\n\r\n  +----------------------+--------------------+----------------------+\r\n  |     Frog No. 1.      |    Frog No. 2.     |     Frog No. 3.      |\r\n  |     Unpoisoned.      |   Poisoned by a    |   Poisoned by the    |\r\n  |                      |   known quantity   |     suspected        |\r\n  |                      |   of digitalin.    |      extract.        |\r\n  +----------------------+--------------------+----------------------+\r\n  |    No. of beats      |   No. of beats     |   No. of beats       |\r\n  |     per minute.      |    per minute.     |    per minute.       |\r\n  +----------------------+--------------------+----------------------+\r\n  | After 6 minutes, 42  |    20              |   26                 |\r\n  |   „  10    „     40  |    16 irregular.   |   24 irregular.      |\r\n  |   „  20    „     40  |    15              |   20     „           |\r\n  |   „  28    „     38  |     0              |   12 very irregular. |\r\n  |   „  31    „     36  |     0              |    0                 |\r\n  +----------------------+--------------------+----------------------+\r\n\r\nIn operating in this way--which is strictly comparative, and, with care,\r\nhas few sources of error--if the heart of the frog poisoned with the\r\nunknown extract behaves in the number and irregularity of its\r\ncontractions similarly to that of the digitalin-poisoned heart, it is a\r\nfair inference that, at all events, a “heart-poison” has been separated;\r\nbut it is, of course, open to question whether this is a digitalin or\r\none of the numerous groups of glucosides acting in the same way. If\r\nsufficient quantity has been separated, chemical reactions, especially\r\nthe bromine test (Grandeau’s test), may decide, but with the larger\r\nnumber (yearly increasing) of substances acting similarly on the heart,\r\ngreat caution in giving an opinion will be necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--Other Poisonous Glucosides Acting on the Heart.\r\n\r\n§ 548. Several members of these glucosides have been studied by\r\nSchmiedeberg,[582] and his convenient divisions will be followed here:--\r\n\r\n[582] _Beiträge zur Kentniss der pharmakol. Gruppe des Digitalins._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. CRYSTALLISABLE GLUCOSIDES.\r\n\r\n    =Antiarin= (C₁₄H₂₀O₅).--Antiarin is an arrow poison obtained from\r\n    the milky juice of the _Antiaris toxicaria_ growing in Java.\r\n    Antiarin is obtained in crystals, by first treating the inspissated\r\n    milky juice with petroleum ether to remove fatty and other matters,\r\n    and then dissolving the active principle out with absolute alcohol.\r\n    The alcoholic extract is taken up with water, precipitated with lead\r\n    acetate, filtered, and from the filtrate antiarin obtained by\r\n    freeing the solution from lead, and then evaporating. De Vry and\r\n    Ludwig obtained about 4 per cent. from the juice. Antiarin is\r\n    crystalline, the crystals containing 2 atoms of water. Its\r\n    melting-point is given as 220·6°; the crystals are soluble in water\r\n    (254 parts cold, 27·4 parts boiling), they are not soluble in\r\n    benzene, and with difficulty in ether; 1 part of antiarin requiring\r\n    2792 parts of ether.\r\n\r\n    The watery solution is not precipitated by metallic salts. On\r\n    warming with dilute mineral acids, antiarin splits up into a resin\r\n    and sugar. Concentrated sulphuric acid gives with antiarin a\r\n    yellow-brown solution, hydrochloric and nitric acids strike no\r\n    distinctive colours.\r\n\r\n    § 549. =Effects.=--Antiarin is essentially a muscular and a heart\r\n    poison. When given in a sufficient dose, it kills a frog in from\r\n    half an hour to an hour. Its most marked effect is on the cardiac\r\n    muscle, the heart beats more and more slowly, and at last stops, the\r\n    ventricle being firmly contracted. As with digitalin, there is a\r\n    very marked prolongation of the systole, and as with digitalin,\r\n    after the beats have ceased, a forcible dilatation of the ventricle\r\n    will restore them (Schmiedeberg). It is doubtful whether by\r\n    physiological experiment antiarin could be differentiated from\r\n    digitalin.\r\n\r\n    § 550. =Separation of Antiarin.=--In any case of poisoning by\r\n    antiarin, it would be best to extract with alcohol, evaporate,\r\n    dissolve the alcoholic extract in water, precipitate with lead\r\n    acetate, filter, free the filtrate from lead, and then, after\r\n    alkalising with ammonia, shake the filtrate successively with\r\n    petroleum ether, benzene, and a small quantity of ether in the\r\n    manner recommended at page 247, _et seq._ The liquid, now freed from\r\n    all fatty, resinous, and alkaloidal bodies, is neutralised and\r\n    evaporated to dryness in a vacuum, and the dry residue taken up with\r\n    absolute alcohol, filtered, the alcohol evaporated at a very low\r\n    temperature, and finally the extract dissolved in a small quantity\r\n    of water, and submitted to physiological tests.\r\n\r\n§ 551. =The Active Principles of the Hellebores.=--The Christmas rose\r\n(_Helleborus niger_), as well as _H. viridis_, _H. fœtidus_, and, in\r\nshort, all the species of hellebore, are poisonous, and if the root is\r\ntreated with alcohol, from the alcoholic extract may be separated two\r\nglucosides, _helleborin_ and _helleborein_.\r\n\r\n=Helleborin= is in the form of white, glittering needles, which, if\r\nplaced on the tongue, are almost tasteless, but if dissolved in alcohol,\r\nand then tasted, give a burning, numbing sensation. By boiling with zinc\r\nchloride, helleborin splits up into sugar and a resin--_helleboresin_.\r\nConcentrated sulphuric acid dissolves the crystals with the production\r\nof a beautiful red colour; on standing, the solution after a while\r\nbecomes colourless, and a white powder separates.\r\n\r\n=Helleborein= forms colourless crystals, mostly consisting of fine\r\nneedles; they have a bitter taste, excite sneezing, and are very\r\nhygroscopic. The crystals easily dissolve in water and dilute alcohol,\r\nbut are with difficulty soluble in absolute alcohol, and not soluble in\r\nether. They dissolve in fatty oils. Helleborein splits by the action of\r\nmineral acids into sugar and amorphous _helleboretin_.\r\n\r\n=Helleboretin= is in the moist condition of a beautiful violet-blue\r\ncolour, becoming, when dried at 100°, dirty green. Concentrated\r\nsulphuric acid dissolves it with the production of a brown-yellow\r\ncolour, which on standing passes into violet and then into brown.\r\n\r\nMarmé separated from _H. fœtidus_, in addition, a white, intensely\r\nodorous substance, but too small in quantity to thoroughly investigate\r\nits properties.\r\n\r\n§ 552. There is little doubt that hellebore owes its properties to the\r\nglucosides just described. There are several instances of poisoning by\r\nhellebore root,[583] and by the pharmaceutical preparations, but none of\r\npoisoning by the pure active principles. Morgagni mentions a case in\r\nwhich 2 grms. (nearly 31 grains) of the watery extract of _H. Niger_\r\ncaused death within eight hours; and Ferrari saw, after the use of the\r\nwine in which the root had been boiled, two persons poisoned with a like\r\nresult. A more recent case was recorded by Felletar, in 1875, in which a\r\nperson died from an infusion of hellebore; there was, however, old\r\nstanding heart-disease, so that there may be a doubt as to the real\r\ncause of death in this instance. Schauenstein mentions a case in which\r\nthe roots of hellebore were accidentally used in soup, but the bitter\r\ntaste prevented any quantity being eaten. The physiological action,\r\nespecially of helleborein, is that of an intense heart poison, and the\r\nsymptoms produced by the hellebores are so strikingly like those of the\r\ndigitalins that it might be difficult to distinguish clinically between\r\nthem. In any case of poisoning, the active principle must be separated\r\nin the form of an alcoholic extract, and identified as a heart poison by\r\nphysiological experiment.\r\n\r\n[583] There used to be a tincture officinal in our pharmacopœia; the\r\nroot of _H. viridis_ is officinal in the German pharmacopœia, maximum\r\nsingle dose, ·3 grm.; maximum total quantity in twenty-four hours, 1·2\r\ngrm. The tincture is also officinal on the Continent.\r\n\r\n    § 553. =Euonymin= is found in a resin obtained from the _Euonymus\r\n    atropurpureus_; it is crystalline, crystallising in colourless,\r\n    cauliflower-like masses consisting of groups of stellate needles,\r\n    which are soluble in water, but with difficulty in alcohol. It is a\r\n    glucoside, and a powerful heart poison, 1 mgrm. causing the heart of\r\n    a frog to cease in diastole.[584]\r\n\r\n[584] Schmiedeberg, _op. cit._, from unpublished researches of Professor\r\nH. Meyer, Dorpat.\r\n\r\n    § 554. =Thevetin= (C₅₄H₄₈O₂).--A glucoside which has been separated\r\n    from the Thevetia nereifolia, and perhaps also from the _Cerbera\r\n    Odallam_. It is soluble in 124 parts of water at 14°, and is easily\r\n    soluble in spirit, but not in ether. It is coloured by sulphuric\r\n    acid red-brown, passing into cherry-red, and then, in a few hours,\r\n    into violet. On boiling with diluted acids, it splits up into sugar\r\n    and theveresin. Both thevetin and theveresin are powerful heart\r\n    poisons.[585]\r\n\r\n[585] Husemann, _Archiv f. exper. Path. u. Pharmakol._, Bd. v., S. 228,\r\n1876.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. SUBSTANCES PARTLY CRYSTALLISABLE BUT WHICH ARE NOT GLUCOSIDES.\r\n\r\n    § 555. =Strophantin= is a very poisonous substance which belongs\r\n    physiologically to this group, but does not seem to be a glucoside.\r\n    It is soluble in water and in alcohol, less so in ether and\r\n    chloroform. It is found in the _kombé_, _manganja_, _inée_, or\r\n    _onaje_, a West African poison derived from the _Strophanthus\r\n    hispidus_ of the family of _Apocynaceæ_. The poison has been\r\n    investigated by several observers.[586]\r\n\r\n[586] _Digitoxin_ (see _ante_, p. 420) belongs to this group.\r\n\r\n    Dr. Fraser considers, from his experiments, (1) That strophantin\r\n    acts primarily on the heart, producing, as an end result, heart\r\n    paralysis, with permanence of the ventricular systole. (2) He found\r\n    the pulmonary respiration to continue in cold-blooded animals many\r\n    minutes after the heart was paralysed. (3) The striped muscles of\r\n    the body are affected, and twitches occur in them; their tonicity is\r\n    exaggerated, and finally their functional activity is destroyed.\r\n    This change is referred to an action on the muscular structure\r\n    itself, independent of that upon the heart, and also independent of\r\n    the cerebro-spinal nervous system. (4) The reflex action of the\r\n    spinal cord is suspended after the heart is paralysed, but the motor\r\n    conductivity of the spinal cord and of the nerve trunks continue\r\n    after the striped muscles of the body are paralysed. (5) The\r\n    lymph-hearts of the frog continue to contract for many minutes after\r\n    the blood-heart has been paralysed.\r\n\r\n    § 556. =Apocynin.=--In the root of _Apocynum cannabinum_ a\r\n    non-crystallisable substance, soluble in alcohol and ether, but not\r\n    soluble easily in water, has been separated and found to have a\r\n    physiological activity similar to that of the digitalins.[587]\r\n\r\n[587] Hardy et Callois, “_Sur la matière active du Strophanthus Hispidus\r\nou Inée_,” _Gaz. Med. de Paris_; Pelikan, _Compt. Rend._, t. 60, p.\r\n1209, 1815; Sharpey,_ Proc. Roy. Soc._, May, 1865; Fagge and Stevenson,\r\n_Pharm.

NON-CRYSTALLISABLE GLUCOSIDES ALMOST INSOLUBLE IN WATER.\r\n\r\n    § 557. =Scillain, or Scillitin=, a glucoside which has been\r\n    separated from the bulbs of the common squill. It is insoluble or\r\n    nearly so in water, but easily dissolves in alcohol. It is little\r\n    soluble in ether. It acts upon the heart, and is poisonous.\r\n\r\n    =Adonidin=, a very similar substance, has been separated from the\r\n    root of the _Adonis vernalis_ (Nat. Ord. _Ranunculaceæ_), to which\r\n    the name of adonidin has been given.[588] It is an amorphous,\r\n    colourless substance, without odour; soluble in alcohol, but with\r\n    difficulty soluble in ether and water. It is precipitated by tannin,\r\n    and on saponification by mineral acids, splits up into sugar and a\r\n    substance soluble in ether. The effects on animals are identical\r\n    with those of digitalin. The root has been used recently in\r\n    medicine, and found to slow the heart and increase the urinary\r\n    secretion; in this also it is like digitalis.\r\n\r\n[588] Cervello, _Archiv für exp. Path. Pharm._, 1882, p. 338.\r\n\r\n    § 558. =Oleandrin.=--Oleander leaves contain two\r\n    chemically-different, nitrogen-free substances. The one is probably\r\n    identical with digitalein; but as this is not certain, Schmiedeberg\r\n    proposes to call it provisionally _neriin_. The other active\r\n    substance is essentially the same as the oleandrin of Lukomske[589]\r\n    and Betelli.[590] Oleandrin has basic properties, and is separated\r\n    in the form of an amorphous mass, soluble in alcohol, ether, and\r\n    chloroform, and slightly soluble in water. Schmiedeberg obtained a\r\n    third product from African leaves, which he calls _nerianthin_.\r\n    This, on treatment with sulphuric acid and bromine, gives a\r\n    beautiful colour peculiar to oleander leaves. It is very similar in\r\n    physiological and chemical properties to digitalin, and is probably\r\n    derived by decomposition from one of the principles already\r\n    described. There is also a product similar to digitaliresin.\r\n\r\n[589] _Repert. de Chimie de Wurtz et Bareswill_, t. iii. p. 77, 1861.\r\n\r\n[590] _Bull. Med. di Bologna_, t. xix. p. 321, 1865.\r\n\r\n    The active principles of the oleander are separated by digestion of\r\n    the leaves with alcohol of 50 per cent., and precipitating the\r\n    alcoholic extract with lead acetate and ammonia. The first\r\n    precipitate is yellow, and is probably composed of a tannin-like\r\n    substance; the next precipitate is white, consisting of the lead\r\n    compound of neriin. The precipitates are filtered off, and the\r\n    filtrate concentrated; nerianthin, after a while, separates in light\r\n    flocks, and the filtrate from this contains some of the other\r\n    products.\r\n\r\n    § 559. =Neriin or Oleander Digitalin.=--Neriin is, in the presence\r\n    of much free mineral acid, precipitated by potass-bismuth iodide, a\r\n    reaction first pointed out by Marmé,[591] as useful in the isolation\r\n    of the helleborins; or it may be precipitated by tannin, and then\r\n    the precipitate decomposed by dissolving in alcohol, and evaporating\r\n    it to dryness with zinc oxide on the water-bath. It is next\r\n    extracted by absolute alcohol, and precipitated by the addition of\r\n    much ether. The further purification consists of resolution in\r\n    alcohol, and fractional precipitation by ether. If, however, the\r\n    potass-bismuth iodide process is used, the liquid must be acidified\r\n    strongly with sulphuric acid, and the precipitate washed with\r\n    diluted sulphuric acid. The precipitate may be decomposed by baryta,\r\n    filtered, and the filtrate freed from baryta by carbon dioxide; the\r\n    filtrate from this contains neriin with baric iodide; it is\r\n    therefore treated with silver sulphate, then again with baryta, next\r\n    with carbon dioxide, and also with SH₂ to get rid of the last trace\r\n    of silver.\r\n\r\n    The filtrate will also contain some oleandrin which, by evaporating\r\n    slowly in a vacuum, separates gradually in the form of a clear,\r\n    resinous mass. It can be filtered off, and the neriin then may be\r\n    precipitated pure by fractional precipitation. Its physiological\r\n    action is the same as that of digitalein.\r\n\r\n[591] _Zeitschr. f. rat. Med._ (3 R.), Bd. xxvi., S. 1, 1866.\r\n\r\n    § 560. The nerium oleander has several times caused grave symptoms\r\n    of poisoning, and they have usually fairly agreed with those\r\n    produced by foxglove. For example, Maschka[592] relates the case of\r\n    a boy, two years old, who ate two handfuls of the nerium oleander.\r\n    The effects commenced in ten minutes, the child was uneasy, and\r\n    vomited. In six hours a sleepy condition came on; the face was pale,\r\n    the skin cold, the pupils contracted, and the pulse slow and\r\n    irregular. After the sickness the boy woke up, but again fell\r\n    asleep, and this occurred frequently; coffee was given, which\r\n    appeared to do good. The pulse was intermittent. On the following\r\n    day the child was still ill, with an intermittent pulse, frequent\r\n    vomiting, feebleness, sleeplessness, and dilatation of the pupil;\r\n    there was no diarrhœa, on the contrary, the bowels were confined. On\r\n    the third day recovery followed.\r\n\r\n[592] _Vierteljahrsschrift f. gericht. Med._, Bd. ii., No. 17, 1860.\r\n_Brit. and For. Med. Chir. Review_, vol. xxvi. p. 523, 1860.\r\n\r\n    In an Indian case,[593] the symptoms were altogether peculiar, and\r\n    belonged rather to the convulsive order. A wood-cutter, aged\r\n    thirty-five, near Kholapore, took, for the purpose of suicide, a\r\n    little over an ounce of the expressed juice of the oleander. The\r\n    symptoms began so rapidly that he had not time to walk five yards\r\n    before he fell insensible; he was brought to the hospital in this\r\n    state; the face on his arrival was noticed to be flushed, the\r\n    breathing stertorous, there were violent spasmodic contractions of\r\n    the whole body, more marked on the left than on the right side. The\r\n    effect of this was remarkable. During the intervals of the spasm,\r\n    the patient lay evenly on his back, and when the convulsions\r\n    commenced the superior contraction of the left side threw him on to\r\n    the right, in which position he remained during the paroxysm, after\r\n    the subsidence of which he fell back into his old position. The\r\n    evacuations were involuntary and watery; the man was insensible,\r\n    with frequent convulsions of the kind described, for two days, but\r\n    on the third day became conscious, and made a good recovery.\r\n\r\n[593] _Transac. of Med. and Phys. Soc. of Bombay_, 1859.\r\n\r\n    In any case of poisoning, the methods by which neriin and oleandrin\r\n    are separated from the plant can be applied to separate them from\r\n    the tissues with more or less success. Here, as in all the other\r\n    digitalin-like glucosides, physiological tests are alone of value in\r\n    the final identification.\r\n\r\n    § 561. =The Madagascar Ordeal Poison.=--To this group may also\r\n    belong the poison of the _Tanghinia venenifera_, a tree in the\r\n    Island of Madagascar, the fruit of which is used as an ordeal\r\n    poison. It may be obtained in crystals; it is insoluble in water,\r\n    and very poisonous. The upas of Singapore is also said to contain\r\n    with strychnine a glucoside similar to antiarin.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. SUBSTANCES WHICH, WITH OTHER TOXIC EFFECTS, BEHAVE LIKE THE\r\nDIGITALIS.\r\n\r\n    § 562. =Erythrophlein= is an alkaloid, not a glucoside, and is\r\n    obtained from the bark of the _Erythrophlœum guineense_ (West\r\n    Africa). It acts on the heart like digitalis, and has also effects\r\n    similar to picrotoxin.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--Saponin--Saponin Substances.\r\n\r\n§ 563. The term “saponin” of late years has been applied to a class of\r\nglucosides which possess the common property of being poisonous, and,\r\nwhen dissolved in water, forming solutions which froth on shaking like\r\nsoap-suds.\r\n\r\nThe substances which have these properties are not all of the same\r\nseries chemically, but those of the general formula, C_{n}H_{2n-8}O₁₀,\r\nare most numerous, and the following is a list:--\r\n\r\n         Name.                                       Formula.\r\n\r\n  Saponin, senegin,      }\r\n  Quillaja-sapotoxin,    }\r\n  Sapindus-sapotoxin,    }                           C₁₇H₂₆O₁₀.\r\n  Grypsophila-sapotoxin, }\r\n  Agrostemma-sapotoxin,  }\r\n  Saponin II., digitonin, saporubrin, assamin,       C₁₈H₂₈O₁₀.\r\n  Saponin III., quillajic acid, polygalic acid, }    C₁₉H₃₀O₁₀.\r\n  Herniari-saponin,                             }\r\n  Cyclamin, sarsaparilla-saponin,                    C₂₀H₃₂O₁₀.\r\n  Sarsa-saponin,                                     C₂₂H₃₆O₁₀.\r\n  Parillin,                                          C₂₆H₄₄O₁₀.\r\n  Melanthin,                                         C₂₉H₅₀O₁₀.\r\n\r\nPossibly also dulcamarin C₂₂H₃₄O₁₀ and syringen C₁₇H₂₆O₁₀ may belong to\r\nthis series.\r\n\r\nThere are some 150 distinct plants which thus yield saponins; a few of\r\nthese plants are as follows:--_Saponaria officinalis_, _Gypsophila\r\nstruthium_, _Agrostemma githago_ (corn cockle), _Polygala senega_,\r\n_Monimia polystachia_, the bark of _Quillaja saponaria_, and\r\n_Chrysophyllum glycyphleum_.\r\n\r\nThe saponin separated from _Saponaria_, and from the corn cockle will be\r\nhere described.\r\n\r\n§ 564. =Properties.=--Saponin is a white amorphous powder, very soluble\r\nin water, to which it gives the curious property of frothing just like\r\nsoap solution. To obtain this effect there must be at least 1 mgrm. in 1\r\nc.c. of liquid. Saponin is neutral in reaction, it has no odour, but\r\ncauses sneezing if applied to the mucous membrane of the nose; the taste\r\nis at first sweet, and then sharp and acrid. It is almost entirely\r\ninsoluble in absolute alcohol, but dissolves in hot alcohol of 83° to\r\nseparate again nearly completely on cooling. It is precipitated by basic\r\nlead acetate, and also by baryta water, but in each case it is advisable\r\nto operate on concentrated solutions. Picric acid, mercuric chloride,\r\nand alkaloidal “group reagents” give no precipitate. When a little of\r\nthe solid substance is treated with “Nessler” reagent, there is a\r\ngreenish or yellow colour produced. A drop of strong sulphuric acid,\r\nmixed with a minute quantity of saponin, strikes slowly a bright red\r\ncolour, which, on heating, deepens to maroon-brown. Nordhausen sulphuric\r\nacid shows this better and more rapidly. If saponin is boiled with\r\ndilute acid it breaks up into sapogenin and sugar, and therefore the\r\nliquid after neutralisation reduces “Fehling.” This reaction is probably\r\nafter the following equation:--\r\n\r\n  2C₁₇H₂₆O₁₀ + 2H₂O = 2C₈H₁₁O₂ + 3C₆H₁₂O₆.\r\n\r\nSapogenin may be separated by evaporating the neutralised liquid to\r\ndryness, treating the dry residue with ether, which dissolves out the\r\nsapogenin, and finally recovering the substance from the ethereal\r\nsolution, and crystallising it from hot alcohol. Crystals are readily\r\nobtained if the alcoholic solution is allowed to evaporate\r\nspontaneously. A solution of saponin exposed to the air gets turbid, and\r\ndevelops carbon dioxide; not unfrequently the solution becomes mouldy.\r\n\r\n§ 565. =Effects.=--Pelikan[594] has studied the effects of various\r\nsaponins on frogs. One to two drops of a saturated watery solution of\r\nsaponin applied subcutaneously to the leg, caused, in from five to six\r\nminutes, great weakness, accompanied by a loss of sensibility; but\r\nstrong mechanical, chemical, or electrical stimuli applied to the foot\r\nexcited reflex action, for the ischiatic nerve still retained its\r\nfunctions. Nevertheless, from the commencement, the excitability of the\r\npoisoned muscles was much weakened, and just before death quite\r\ndisappeared. Section of the ischiatic nerve delayed the phenomena.\r\nCurarine did not seem to have any effect on the poisonous action. A\r\nconcentrated solution applied to the heart of a frog soon arrests its\r\nbeats, but weaker doses first excite, and then retard.[595]\r\n\r\n[594] _Berl. klin. Wochschr._, 36, 186.\r\n\r\n[595] J. Hoppe, _Nervenwirkung der Heilmittel_, H. 4, 37.\r\n\r\nThe author has studied the general action of saponin on kittens,\r\ninsects, and infusoria. Small doses, such as from 13 to 32 mgrms. (⅕ to\r\n½ grain), were injected beneath the loose skin of the back of the neck\r\nof a kitten, when there were immediate symptoms of local pain. In from\r\nfive to ten minutes the respiration notably quickened, and the animal\r\nfell into a lethargic state, with signs of general muscular weakness;\r\njust before death the breathing became very rapid, and there were all\r\nthe signs of asphyxia. The pathological appearances after death were\r\nfulness in the right side of the heart, and intense congestion of the\r\nintestinal canal, the stomach generally being perfectly normal in\r\nappearance, and the kidneys and other organs healthy. The least fatal\r\ndose for a kitten seems to be 13 mgrms., or ·04 grm. to a kilogram.[596]\r\n\r\n[596] The action of saponin when applied in concentrated solution to\r\nflies is that of an intense irritant. There is protrusion of the sucker,\r\nand progressive paralysis. The common infusoria live for some time in\r\ndilute solutions of saponin--this is also true of some of the higher\r\nforms; for example, a _Cyclops quadricornis_ seemed in no way affected\r\nby a 2 per cent. solution.\r\n\r\n§ 566. =Action on Man.=--The effects of saponin on man have been but\r\nlittle studied; it has been administered by the mouth in doses of from\r\n·1 to ·2 grm., and in those doses seems to have distinct physiological\r\neffects. There is increased mucous secretion, and a feeling of nausea;\r\nbut neither diaphoresis nor diuresis has been observed. From the\r\nforegoing study it may be predicated that 2·6 grms. (40 grains), if\r\nadministered subcutaneously to an adult, would endanger life. The\r\nsymptoms would be great muscular prostration, weakness of the heart’s\r\naction, and probably diarrhœa. In fatal cases, some signs of an irritant\r\nor inflammatory action on the mucous membranes of the stomach and\r\nintestines would be probable.\r\n\r\n§ 567. =Separation of Saponin.=--Saponin is separated from bread, flour,\r\nand similar substances by the process given at p. 153, “Foods.” The\r\nprocess essentially consists in extracting with hot spirit, allowing the\r\nsaponin to separate as the spirit cools, collecting the precipitate on\r\na filter, drying, dissolving in cold water, and precipitating with\r\nabsolute alcohol. In operating on animal tissues, a more elaborate\r\nprocess is necessary. The author has successfully proceeded as\r\nfollows:--The finely divided organ is digested in alcohol of 80 to 90\r\nper cent. strength, and boiled for a quarter of an hour; the alcohol is\r\nfiltered hot and allowed to cool, when a deposit forms, consisting of\r\nfatty matters, and containing any saponin present. The deposit is\r\nfiltered off, dried, and treated with ether to remove fat. The insoluble\r\nsaponin remaining is dissolved in the least possible quantity of water,\r\nand precipitated with absolute alcohol. It is also open to the analyst\r\nto purify it by precipitating with baryta water, the baryta compound\r\nbeing subsequently decomposed by carbon dioxide. Basic lead acetate may\r\nalso be used as a precipitant, the lead compound being, as usual,\r\ndecomposed by hydric sulphide; lastly, a watery solution may be shaken\r\nup with chloroform, which will extract saponin. By some one of these\r\nmethods, selected according to the exigencies of the case, there will be\r\nno difficulty in separating the glucoside in a fairly pure state. The\r\norgan best to examine for saponin is the kidney. In one of my own\r\nexperiments, in a cat poisoned with a subcutaneous dose of saponin (·2\r\ngrm.), evidence of the glucoside was obtained from the kidney alone. The\r\ntime after death at which it is probable that saponin could be detected\r\nis unknown; it is a substance easily decomposed, and, therefore, success\r\nin separating it from highly putrid matters is not probable.\r\n\r\n§ 568. =Identification of Saponin.=--An amorphous white powder, very\r\nsoluble in water, insoluble in cold alcohol or ether, having glucosidal\r\nreactions, striking a red colour with sulphuric acid, imparting a\r\nsoap-like condition to water, and poisonous to animals, is most probably\r\na saponin.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIVISION III.--CERTAIN POISONOUS ANHYDRIDES OF ORGANIC ACIDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--Santonin.\r\n\r\n§ 569. Santonin (C₁₅H₁₈O₃) is a neutral principle extracted from the\r\nunexpanded heads of various species of _Artemisia_ (Nat. Ord.\r\n_Compositæ_). The seeds contain, according to Dragendorff, 2·03 to 2·13\r\nper cent. of santonin, and about 2·25 per cent. of volatile oil, with 3\r\nper cent. of fat and resin. Santonin forms brilliant, white, four-sided,\r\nflat prisms, in taste feebly bitter. The crystals become yellow through\r\nage and exposure to light; they melt at 169°, and are capable of being\r\nsublimed; they are scarcely soluble in cold water, but dissolve in 250\r\nparts of boiling water, freely in alkaline water, in 3 parts of boiling\r\nalcohol, and in 42 parts of boiling ether. Santonin is the anhydride of\r\nsantonic acid (C₁₅H₂₀O₄). Santonin unites with alkalies to form\r\nsantonates. Sodic santonate (C₁₅H₁₉NaO₄ + 3½H₂O) is officinal on the\r\nContinent; it forms colourless rhombic crystals, soluble in 3 parts of\r\ncold water.\r\n\r\n§ 570. =Poisoning by Santonin.=--Eighteen cases of poisoning, either by\r\nsantonin or santonin-holding substances, which F. A. Falck has been able\r\nto collect, were nearly all occasioned by its use as a remedy for worms.\r\nA few were poisonings of children who had swallowed it by accident. With\r\none exception those poisoned were children of from two to twelve years\r\nof age; in five the flower heads, and in thirteen santonin itself was\r\ntaken. Of the eighteen cases, two only died (about 11 per cent.).\r\n\r\n§ 571. =Fatal Dose.=--So small a number of children have died from\r\nsantonin, that data are not present for fixing the minimum fatal dose.\r\n·12 grm. of santonin killed a boy of five and a half years of age in\r\nfifteen hours; a girl, ten years old, died from a quantity of flower\r\nheads, equal to ·2 grm. of santonin. The maximum dose for children is\r\nfrom 65 to 194 mgrms. (1 to 3 grains), and twice the quantity for\r\nadults.\r\n\r\n§ 572. =Effects on Animals.=--Experiments on animals with santonin have\r\nbeen numerous. It has first an exciting action on the centres of nerves\r\nfrom the second to the seventh pairs, and then follows decrease of\r\nexcitability. The medulla is later affected. There are tetanic\r\nconvulsions, and death follows through asphyxia. Artificial respiration\r\nlessens the number and activity of the convulsions, and chloroform,\r\nchloral hydrate, or ether, also either prevent or shorten the attacks.\r\n\r\n§ 573. =Effects on Man.=--One of the most constant effects of santonin\r\nis a peculiar aberration of the colour-sense, first observed by Hufeland\r\nin 1806. All things seem yellow, and this may last for twenty-four\r\nhours, seldom longer. According to Rose, this apparent yellowness is\r\noften preceded by a violet hue over all objects. If the lids are closed\r\nwhile the “yellow sight” is present, the whole field is momentarily\r\nviolet. De Martiny,[597] in a few cases, found the “yellow sight”\r\nintermit and pass into other colours, _e.g._, after ·3 grm. there was\r\nfirst the yellow perception, then giving the same individual ·6 grm.,\r\nall objects seemed coloured red, after half an hour orange, and then\r\nagain yellow. In another patient the effect of the drug was to give\r\n“green vision,” and in a third blue.\r\n\r\n[597] _Gaz. des Hôpit._, 1860.\r\n\r\nHufner and Helmholtz explain this curious effect as a direct action on\r\nthe nervous elements of the retina, causing them to give the perception\r\nof violet; they are first excited, then exhausted, and the eye is\r\n“violet blind.” On the other hand, it has been suggested that santonin\r\neither colours the media of the eye yellow, or that there is an increase\r\nin the pigment of the _macula lutea_. I, however, cannot comprehend how\r\nthe two last theories will account for the intermittency and the play of\r\ncolours observed in a few cases. To the affections of vision are also\r\noften added hallucinations of taste and smell; there is headache and\r\ngiddiness, and in fourteen out of thirty of Rose’s observations vomiting\r\noccurred. The urinary secretion is increased. In large and fatal doses\r\nthere are shivering of the body, clonic, and often tetanic convulsions;\r\nthe consciousness is lost, the skin is cool, but covered with sweat, the\r\npupils dilated, the breathing becomes stertorous, the heart’s action\r\nweak and slow, and death occurs in collapse--in the case observed by\r\nGrimm in fifteen hours, in one observed by Linstow in forty-eight hours.\r\nIn those patients who have recovered, there have also been noticed\r\nconvulsions and loss of consciousness. Sieveking[598] has recorded the\r\ncase of a child who took ·12 grm. (1·7 grain) santonin; an eruption of\r\nnettle rash showed itself, but disappeared within an hour.\r\n\r\n[598] _Brit. Med. Journ._, 1871.\r\n\r\n§ 574. =Post-mortem Appearances.=--The _post-mortem_ appearances are not\r\ncharacteristic.\r\n\r\n§ 575. =Separation of Santonin from the Contents of the Stomach,\r\n&c.=--It is specially important to analyse the fæces, for it has been\r\nobserved that some portion goes unchanged into the intestinal canal. The\r\nurine, also, of persons who have taken santonin, possesses some\r\nimportant peculiarities. It becomes of a peculiar yellow-green, the\r\ncolour appearing soon after the ingestion of the drug, and lasting even\r\nsixty hours. The colour may be imitated, and therefore confused with\r\nthat which is produced by the bile acids; a similar colour is also seen\r\nafter persons have been taking rhubarb. Alkalies added to urine coloured\r\nby santonin or rhubarb strike a red colour. If the urine thus reddened\r\nis digested on zinc dust, santonin urine fades, rhubarb urine remains\r\nred. Further, if the reddened urine is precipitated by excess of milk of\r\nlime or baryta water and filtered, the filtrate from the urine reddened\r\nby rhubarb is colourless, in that reddened by santonin the colour\r\nremains. Santonin may be isolated by treating substances containing it\r\nwith warm alkaline water. The water may now be acidified and shaken up\r\nwith chloroform, which will dissolve out any santonin. On driving off\r\nthe chloroform, the residue should be again alkalised, dissolved in\r\nwater, and acidified with hydrochloric acid, and shaken up with\r\nchloroform. In this way, by operating several times, it may be obtained\r\nvery pure. Santonin may be identified by its dissolving in alcoholic\r\npotash to a transitory carmine-red, but the best reaction is to dissolve\r\nit in concentrated sulphuric acid, to which a very little water has\r\nbeen added, to warm on the water-bath, and then to add a few drops of\r\nferric chloride solution to the warm acid; a ring of a beautiful red\r\ncolour passing into purple surrounds each drop, and after a little time,\r\non continuing the heat, the purple passes into brown. A distinctive\r\nreaction is also the production of “iso-santonin”; this substance is\r\nproduced by warming santonin on the water-bath with sulphuric acid for a\r\nfew hours, and then diluting with water; iso-santonin is precipitated,\r\nand may be crystallised from boiling alcohol. Iso-santonin melts at\r\n138°; it has the same composition as santonin. It is distinguished from\r\nsantonin by giving no red colour when treated with sulphuric or\r\nphosphoric acids.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--Mezereon.\r\n\r\n    § 576. =The Daphne Mezereum= (L.).--Mezereon, an indigenous shrub\r\n    belonging to the _Thymeleaceæ_, is rather rare in the wild state,\r\n    but very frequent in gardens. The flowers are purple and the berries\r\n    red. Buckheim isolated by means of ether an acrid resin, which was\r\n    converted by saponifying agents into _mezereic acid_; the acrid\r\n    resin is the anhydride of the acid. The resin is presumed to be the\r\n    active poisonous constituent of the plant, but the subject awaits\r\n    further investigation. There are a few cases of poisoning on record,\r\n    and they have been mostly from the berries. Thus, Linné has recorded\r\n    an instance in which a little girl died after eating twelve berries.\r\n    The symptoms observed in the recorded cases have been burning in the\r\n    mouth, gastroenteritis, vomiting, giddiness, narcosis, and\r\n    convulsions, ending in death. The lethal dose for a horse is about\r\n    30 grms. of powdered bark; for a dog, the œsophagus being tied, 12\r\n    grms.; but smaller doses of the fresh leaves may be deadly.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIVISION IV.--VARIOUS VEGETABLE POISONOUS PRINCIPLES--NOT ADMITTING OF\r\nCLASSIFICATION UNDER THE PREVIOUS THREE DIVISIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--Ergot of Rye.\r\n\r\n§ 577. Ergot is a peculiar fungus attacking the rye and other\r\ngraminaceous plants;[599] it has received various names, _Claviceps\r\npurpurea_ (Tulasne), _Spermœdia clavus_ (Fries), _Sclerotium clavus_\r\n(D.C.), &c. The peculiar train of symptoms arising from the eating of\r\nergotised grain (culminating occasionally in gangrene of the lower\r\nlimbs), its powerful action on the pregnant uterus, and its styptic\r\neffects, are well known.\r\n\r\n[599] Some of the _Cyperaceæ_ are also attacked.\r\n\r\nThe very general use of the drug by accoucheurs has, so to speak,\r\npopularised a knowledge of its action among all classes of society, and\r\nits criminal employment as an abortive appears to be on the\r\nincrease.[600]\r\n\r\n[600] The Russian peasantry use the drug for the same purpose. _Vide_\r\nMackenzie Wallace’s “Russia,” i. p. 117.\r\n\r\nThe healthy grain of rye, if examined microscopically in thin sections,\r\nis seen to be composed of the seed-coating, made up of two layers,\r\nbeneath which are the gluten-cells, whilst the great bulk of the seed is\r\ncomposed of cells containing starch. In the ergotised grain, dark\r\n(almost black) cells replace the seed-coat and the gluten-cells, whilst\r\nthe large starch-containing cells are filled with the small cells of the\r\nfungus and numerous drops of oil.\r\n\r\n§ 578. =The chemical constituents of ergot= are a fixed oil,\r\ntrimethylamine, certain active principles, and colouring-matters.\r\n\r\nThe =fixed oil= is of a brownish-yellow colour, of aromatic flavour and\r\nacrid taste; its specific gravity is 0·924, and it consists chiefly of\r\npalmitin and olein; it has no physiological action.\r\n\r\n=Trimethylamine= is always present ready formed in ergot; it can also be\r\nproduced by the action of potash on ergot.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the =active principles of ergot= considerable confusion\r\nstill exists, and no one has hitherto isolated any single substance in\r\nsuch a state of purity as to inspire confidence as to its formula or\r\nother chemical characters. They may, however, be briefly described.\r\n\r\nC. Tamet[601] has separated an alkaloid, which appears identical with\r\nWenzel’s _ergotinine_. To obtain this the ergot is extracted by alcohol\r\nof 86°, the spirit removed by distillation, and the residue cooled; a\r\nresin (which is deposited) and a fatty layer (which floats on the\r\nsurface) are separated from the extractive liquor and washed with ether;\r\nthe ethereal solution is filtered and shaken with dilute sulphuric acid,\r\nwhich takes up the alkaloid; the aqueous solution of the substance is\r\nthen filtered, rendered alkaline by KHO, and agitated with chloroform.\r\nThe ergotinine is now obtained by evaporating the chloroform solution,\r\ncare being taken to protect it from contact with the air. It gives\r\nprecipitates with chloride of gold, potassium iodohydrargyrate,\r\nphosphomolybdic acid, tannin, bromine water, and the chlorides of gold\r\nand platinum. With moderately concentrated SO₄H₂, it gives a\r\nyellowish-red coloration, changing to an intense violet, a reaction\r\nwhich does not occur if the alkaloid has been exposed to the air. The\r\ncomposition of the base is represented by the formula C₇₀H₄₀N₄O₁₂, and a\r\ncrystalline sulphate and lactate have been obtained.[602]\r\n\r\n[601] _Compt. Rendus_, vol. xxxi. p. 896.\r\n\r\n[602] _Compt. Rendus_, April 1878.\r\n\r\nWenzel’s =Ecboline= is prepared by precipitating the cold watery extract\r\nof ergot with sugar of lead, throwing out the lead in the usual way by\r\nhydric sulphide, concentrating the liquid, and adding mercuric chloride,\r\nwhich only precipitates the ecboline. The mercury salt is now decomposed\r\nwith hydric sulphide, and after the mercury precipitate has been\r\nfiltered off, the filtrate is treated with freshly precipitated\r\nphosphate of silver, and refiltered; lastly, the liquid is shaken up\r\nwith milk of lime, again filtered, and the lime thrown out by CO₂. The\r\nlast filtrate contains ecboline only, and is obtained by evaporation at\r\na gentle heat. It is an amorphous, feebly bitter substance, with an\r\nalkaline reaction, forming only amorphous salts.\r\n\r\nThe most recent research by Dragendorff on ergot tends to show that\r\nWenzel’s alkaloids, ergotinine and ecboline, are inactive. Dragendorff\r\ndescribes also (_a._) _Scleromucin_, a slimy substance which goes into\r\nsolution upon extraction of the ergot with water, and which is again\r\nprecipitated by 40 to 45 per cent. alcohol. It is colloidal and soluble\r\nwith difficulty in water. It contains nitrogen, but gives no albuminoid\r\nreaction, nor any reaction of an alkaloidal or glucosidal body; it\r\nyields to analysis--\r\n\r\n   8·26 per cent. Water.\r\n  26·8     „      Ash.\r\n  39·0     „      Carbon.\r\n   6·44    „      Hydrogen.\r\n   6·41    „      Nitrogen.\r\n\r\n(_b._) =Sclerotic Acid.=--A feebly-acid substance, easily soluble in\r\nwater and dilute and moderately concentrated alcohol. It passes, in\r\nassociation with other constituents of the ergot extract, into the\r\ndiffusate, when the extract is submitted to dialysis; but after its\r\nseparation in a pure state it is, like scleromucin, colloidal. It is\r\nprecipitated by 85 to 90 per cent. alcohol, together with lime, potash,\r\nsoda, silica, and manganese; but after maceration with hydrochloric\r\nacid, the greater part of the ash constituents can be separated by a\r\nfresh precipitation with absolute alcohol. The sample gave 40·0 per\r\ncent. of carbon, 5·2 per cent. hydrogen, 4·2 per cent. nitrogen, 50.6\r\nper cent. oxygen, with 3·4 per cent. of ash. Sclerotic acid forms with\r\nlime a compound that is not decomposed by carbonic acid, and which upon\r\ncombustion leaves from 19 to 20 per cent. of calcium carbonate. Both\r\nthese substances are active, although evidently impure. Sclerotic acid\r\nis sold in commerce, and has been employed subcutaneously in midwifery\r\npractice in Russia and Germany for some time.\r\n\r\nThe inert principles of ergot are--(1.) A red colouring matter,\r\n_Sclererythrin_, insoluble in water, but soluble in dilute and strong\r\nalcohol, ether, chloroform, dilute solutions of potash, ammonia, &c. It\r\ncan be obtained by dissolving in an alkali, neutralising with an acid,\r\nand shaking up with ether. Alcoholic solution of sclererythrin gives\r\nwith aluminium sulphate, and with zinc chloride, a splendid red mixture;\r\nwith salts of calcium, barium, and many of the heavy metals, it gives a\r\nblue precipitate; the yield is only ·1 to ·05 in a thousand parts.\r\n\r\n(2.) Another colouring-matter, dissolving in concentrated sulphuric acid\r\nwith the production of a fine blue violet colour, the discoverer has\r\nnamed _Scleroidin_. This is not soluble in alcohol, ether, chloroform,\r\nor water, but dissolves in alkaline solutions, potash producing a\r\nsplendid violet colour; yield about 1 per 1000.\r\n\r\n(3, 4.) Two crystalline substances, which may be obtained from ergot\r\npowder, first treated with an aqueous solution of tartaric acid, and the\r\ncolouring-matters extracted by ether. One Dragendorff names\r\n_Sclerocrystallin_ (C₁₀H₁₀O₄); it is in colourless needles, insoluble in\r\nalcohol and water, with difficulty soluble in ether, but dissolving in\r\nammonia and potash solutions. The other crystalline substance is thought\r\nto be merely a hydrated compound of sclerocrystallin. Both are without\r\nphysiological action.\r\n\r\nKobert recognises two active substances in ergot, and two alone; the one\r\nhe calls _sphacelic acid_, the other _cornutin_.\r\n\r\n§ 579. =Detection of Ergot in Flour= (see “Foods”).--The best process is\r\nto exhaust the flour with boiling alcohol. The alcoholic solution is\r\nacidified with dilute sulphuric acid, and the coloured liquid examined\r\nby the spectroscope in thicker or thinner layers, according to the depth\r\nof colour. A similar alcoholic solution of ergot should be made, and the\r\nspectrum compared. If the flour is ergotised, the solution will be more\r\nor less red, and show two absorption bands, one in the green, and a\r\nbroader and stronger one in the blue. On mixing the original solution\r\nwith twice its volume of water, and shaking successive portions of this\r\nliquid with ether, amyl alcohol, benzene, and chloroform, the red\r\ncolour, if derived from ergot, will impart its colour to each and all of\r\nthese solvents.\r\n\r\n§ 580. =Pharmaceutical Preparations.=--Ergot itself is officinal in all\r\nthe pharmacopœias, and occurs in grains from ⅓ to 1 inch in length, and\r\nabout the same breadth, triangular, curved, obtuse at the ends, of a\r\npurple colour, covered with a bloom, and brittle, exhibiting a pinkish\r\ninterior, and the microscopical appearances already detailed. Ergot may\r\nalso occur as a brown powder, possessing the unmistakable odour of the\r\ndrug. A liquid extract of the B.P. is prepared by digesting 16 parts of\r\nergot in 80 parts of water for twelve hours, the infusion is decanted or\r\nfiltered off, and the digestion repeated with 40 parts of water; this is\r\nalso filtered off, and the residue pressed, and the whole filtrate\r\nunited and evaporated down to 11 parts; when cold, 6 parts of rectified\r\nspirit are added, and, after standing, the liquid is filtered and made\r\nup to measure 16. A tincture and an infusion are also officinal; the\r\nlatter is very frequently used, but seldom sold, for it is preferable to\r\nprepare it on the spot. The tincture experience has shown to be far\r\ninferior in power to the extract, and it is not much used. Ergotin is a\r\npurified extract of uncertain strength; it is used for hypodermic\r\ninjection; it should be about five times more active than the liquid\r\nextract.\r\n\r\n§ 581. =Dose.=--The main difficulties in the statement of the medicinal\r\ndose, and of the minimum quantity which will destroy life, are the\r\nextreme variability of different samples of ergot, and its readiness to\r\ndecompose. A full medicinal dose of ergot itself, as given to a woman in\r\nlabour, is 4 grms. (61·7 grains), repeated every half hour. In this way\r\nenormous doses may be given in some cases without much effect. On the\r\nother hand, single doses of from 1 to 4 grms. have caused serious\r\npoisonous symptoms. The extract and the tincture are seldom given in\r\nlarger doses than that of a drachm as a first dose, to excite uterine\r\ncontraction. In fact, the medical practitioner has in many cases to\r\nexperiment on his patient with the drug, in order to discover, not only\r\nthe individual susceptibility, but the activity of the particular\r\npreparation used. From the experiments of Nikitin, it is probable that\r\nthe least fatal dose of sclerotic acid for an adult man is 20 mgrms. per\r\nkilogrm.\r\n\r\n§ 582. =Ergotism.=--Ergotised cereals have played a great part in\r\nvarious epidemics, probably from very early times, but the only accurate\r\nrecords respecting them date from the sixteenth century. According to\r\nDr. Tissot,[603] the first recorded epidemic was in 1596, when a\r\nstrange, spasmodic, convulsive disease broke out in Hessia and the\r\nneighbouring regions. It was probably due to spurred rye. In\r\nVoigtländer, the same disease appeared in 1648, 1649, and 1675; in 1702\r\nthe whole of Freiberg was attacked. In Germany and in France successive\r\nepidemics are described throughout the eighteenth century. In France, in\r\n1710, Ch. Noel, physician at the _Hôtel Dieu_, had no less than fifty\r\ncases under treatment at the same time.\r\n\r\n[603] Dr. Tissot in _Phil. Trans._, vol. lv. p. 106, 1765. This is a\r\nLatin letter by Dr. Baker, and gives a good history of the various\r\nepidemics of ergotism.\r\n\r\nIt is generally said that in 1630, Thuillier, in describing an ergot\r\nepidemic which broke out in Cologne, first referred the cause of the\r\ndisease to spurred rye.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to inquire into the mortality from this disease. In\r\n1770, in an epidemic described by Taube, in which 600 were affected, 16\r\nper cent. died. In a nineteenth-century epidemic (1855), in which,\r\naccording to Husemann, 30 were ill, 23·3 per cent. died. In other\r\nepidemics, according to Heusinger, out of 102, 12 per cent. died;\r\naccording to Griepenkerl, out of 155, 25 or 16 per cent. died; and,\r\naccording to Meyer, of 283 cases, 6 per cent. died.\r\n\r\nThere are two forms of chronic poisoning by ergot--one a spasmodic form,\r\nthe other the gangrenous form.\r\n\r\n§ 583. =The convulsive form of ergotism= mostly begins with some\r\ncerebral disturbance. There are sparks before the eyes, giddiness,\r\nnoises in the ears, and a creeping feeling about the body. There is also\r\nvery commonly anæsthesia of the fingers and toes, and later of the\r\nextremities, of the back, and even of the tongue. Diarrhœa, vomiting,\r\ncolic, and other signs of intestinal irritation seldom fail to be\r\npresent; there are also tetanic spasms of the muscles, rising in some\r\ncases to well-marked tetanus; epilepsy, faintings, aberrations of\r\nvision, amaurosis, and amblyopia are frequent; the skin becomes of a\r\nyellow or earthy colour, and is covered with a cold sweat; boils and\r\nother eruptions may break out; blebs, like those caused by burns or\r\nscalds, have in a few cases been noticed. Death may occur in from four\r\nto twelve weeks after the eating of the spurred grain from exhaustion.\r\nIn those individuals who recover, there remain for some time weakness,\r\ncontractions of groups of muscles, anæmia, or affections of vision.\r\n\r\n§ 584. =The Gangrenous Form of Ergotism.=--In this form there is\r\ngenerally acute pain in the limb or limbs which are to mortify; and\r\nthere may be prodromata, similar to those already described. The limb\r\nswells, is covered with an erysipelatous blush, but at the same time\r\nfeels icy cold; the gangrene is generally dry, occasionally moist; the\r\nmummified parts separate from the healthy by a moist, ulcerative\r\nprocess; and in this way the toes, fingers, legs, and even the nose, may\r\nbe lost. During the process of separation there is some fever, and\r\npyæmia may occur with a fatal result.\r\n\r\nFontenelle described a case in which a rustic lost all the toes of one\r\nfoot, then those of the other; after that, the remnant of the first\r\nfoot, and lastly the leg. But probably the most extraordinary case of\r\ngangrene caused by the use of ergot is that which occurred at Wattisham,\r\nSuffolk, in the family of a labouring man named John Downing. He had a\r\nwife and six children of various ages, from fifteen years to four\r\nmonths. On Monday, January 10, 1762, the eldest girl complained of a\r\npain in the calf of her left leg; in the evening, her sister, aged 10,\r\nalso experienced the same symptoms. On the following Monday, the mother\r\nand another child, and on Tuesday, all the rest of the family except the\r\nfather became affected. The pain was very violent. The baby at the\r\nbreast lived a few weeks, and died of mortification of the extremities.\r\nThe limbs of the family now began to slough off, and the following are\r\nthe notes on their condition made by an observer, Dr. C. Wollaston,\r\nF.R.S., on April 13:--\r\n\r\n“The mother, aged 40. Right foot off at the ankle, the left leg\r\nmortified; a mere bone left, but not off.\r\n\r\n“Elizabeth, aged 13. Both legs off below the knees.\r\n\r\n“Sarah, aged 10. One foot off at the ankle.\r\n\r\n“Robert, aged 8. Both legs off below the knees.\r\n\r\n“Richard, aged 4. Both feet off at the ankle.\r\n\r\n“Infant, four months old, dead.”\r\n\r\nThe father was also attacked a fortnight after the rest of the family,\r\nand in a slighter degree--the pain being confined to the fingers of his\r\nright hand, which turned a blackish colour, and were withered for some\r\ntime, but ultimately got better.\r\n\r\nAs a remarkable fact, it is specially noted that the family were in\r\nother respects well. They ate heartily, and slept soundly when the pain\r\nbegan to abate. The mother looked emaciated. “The poor boy in particular\r\nlooked as healthy and florid as possible, and was sitting on the bed,\r\nquite jolly, drumming with his stumps.” They lived as the country people\r\nat the time usually lived, on dried peas, pickled pork, bread and\r\ncheese, milk, and small beer. Dr. Wollaston strictly examined the corn\r\nwith which they made the bread, and he found it “very bad; it was wheat\r\nthat had been cut in a rainy season, and had lain in the ground till\r\nmany of the grains were black and totally decayed.”[604]\r\n\r\n[604] In the _Phil. Trans._ for 1762 there are two strictly concordant\r\naccounts of this case; and in the parish church of Wattisham, there is\r\nsaid to be a memorial tablet, which runs as follows:--“This inscription\r\nserves to authenticate the truth of a singular calamity which suddenly\r\nhappened to a poor family in this parish, of which six persons lost\r\ntheir feet by a mortification not to be accounted for. A full narrative\r\nof their case is recorded in the Parish Register and _Philosophical\r\nTransactions_ for 1762.”\r\n\r\n§ 585. =Symptoms of Acute Poisoning by Ergot.=--In a fatal case of\r\npoisoning by ergot of rye, recorded by Dr. Davidson,[605] in which a\r\nhospital nurse, aged 28, took ergot, the symptoms were mainly vomiting\r\nof blood, the passing of bloody urine, intense jaundice, and stupor. But\r\nin other cases, jaundice and vomiting of blood have not been recorded,\r\nand the general course of acute poisoning shows, on the one hand,\r\nsymptoms of intense gastro-intestinal irritation, as vomiting, colicky\r\npains, and diarrhœa; and, on the other, of a secondary affection of the\r\nnervous system, weakness of the limbs, aberrations of vision, delirium,\r\nretention of urine, coma, and death.\r\n\r\n[605] _Lancet_, Sept. 30, 1882.\r\n\r\n§ 586. =Physiological Action as shown by Experiments on Animals.=--In\r\nspite of numerous experiments on animals and man, the action of the\r\nergot principles remains obscure. It has been found in medicine to exert\r\na specific action on the uterus,[606] causing powerful contractions of\r\nthat organ, especially in labour. It is also a hæmostatic, and is used\r\nto check bleeding from the lungs and other internal organs of the body.\r\nThis hæmostatic action, as well as the extraordinary property possessed\r\nby ergot, of producing an arrest or disturbance of the circulation\r\ninducing gangrene has naturally led to the belief that ergot causes a\r\nnarrowing in the calibre of the small arteries, but this has not\r\nreceived the necessary experimental sanction. Holmes,[607] Eberty,\r\nKöhler,[608] and Wernick,[609] all observed a contraction in the part to\r\nwhich the ergot was applied, both in frogs and in warm-blooded animals;\r\nbut L. Hermann,[610] although he made many experiments, and used the\r\nmost different preparations, never succeeded in observing a contraction.\r\nIt would also seem reasonable to expect that with a narrowing of the\r\nvessels, which means a peripheral obstruction, the blood-pressure would\r\nrise, but on the contrary the pressure sinks, a fact on which there is\r\nno division of opinion.\r\n\r\n[606] In a case in which the author was engaged, a dabbler in drugs,\r\nhaving seduced a young woman, administered to her a dose of ergot which\r\nproduced a miscarriage, and for this offence he was convicted. The\r\ndefence raised was that ergot is a common medicine used by physicians in\r\nthe treatment of amenorrhœa, and other uterine affections. Although in\r\nitself this statement was perfectly true, as a defence it was\r\ninvalidated by the large dose given, the fact of the seduction, and the\r\nother circumstances of the case.\r\n\r\n[607] _Archiv d. Physiol. Norm. u. Pathol._, iii. p. 384.\r\n\r\n[608] _Ueber die Wirkungen des Secale Cornutum_, Dissert. Halle, 1873.\r\n\r\n[609] _Arch. f. pathol. Anat._, lvi. p 505.\r\n\r\n[610] _Lehrbuch der exper. Toxicologie_, Berlin, 1874, p. 386.\r\n\r\nNikitin has made some researches with pure sclerotic acid, which\r\ncertainly possesses the most prominent therapeutic effects of ergot; but\r\nsince it is not the only _toxic_ substance, it may not represent the\r\ncollective action of the drug, just in the same way that morphine is not\r\nequivalent in action to opium. Cold-blooded animals are very sensitive\r\nto sclerotic acid; of the warm-blooded the carnivoræ are more sensitive\r\nthan the herbivoræ. The toxic action is specially directed to the\r\ncentral nervous system--with frogs, the reflex excitability is\r\ndiminished to full paralysis; with warm-blooded animals reflex\r\nexcitability is only diminished, and continues to exist even to death.\r\n\r\nThe temperature falls, the breathing is slowed, and the respiration\r\nstops before the heart ceases to beat; the peristaltic action of the\r\nintestines is quickened, and the uterus (even of non-pregnant animals)\r\nis thrown into contraction. The terminations of the sensory nerves are\r\nparalysed by the direct action of sclerotic acid, but they remain intact\r\nwith general poisoning. The heart of frogs is slowed by sclerotic acid.\r\nEberty observed that this slowing of the heart (he used ergotin) was\r\nproduced even after destruction of the spinal cord; he therefore\r\nconsidered it as acting on the inhibitory nerve apparatus of the heart\r\nitself. Rossbach, using Wenzel’s ecbolin, has also studied its action on\r\nthe heart of the frog, and observed that the slowing affected the\r\nventricles rather than the auricles, so that for one ventricle-systole\r\nthere were two contractions of the auricles; besides which, the\r\ncontractions themselves were peculiar and abnormal in character. The\r\ncause of death from sclerotic acid seems to be paralysis of the\r\nrespiration. It is said not to affect animal fœtal life. With regard to\r\nthe effects produced by feeding animals with ergotised grain,\r\nexperiments made during the last century have proved that it produces a\r\ngangrenous disease, _e.g._, C. Salerné mixed one part of spurred rye\r\nwith two of good barley, and fed pigs with the mixture; a few days\r\nafterwards the pigs perished with dilated, hard, and black bellies, and\r\noffensively ulcerated legs; another pig fed entirely on the rye, lost\r\nits four feet and both ears.\r\n\r\nKobert[611] has investigated the effects produced on animals by\r\n“sphacelic acid,” and by “cornutin.” Sphacelic acid appears to cause\r\ngangrene, like ergot, and Kobert believes that in “sphacelic acid” is to\r\nbe found the gangrene-producing substance. In cases of death\r\nputrefaction is rapid, the mucous membrane of the intestine is swollen,\r\nand the spleen enlarged. If the mucous membrane of the intestine is\r\nexamined microscopically, a large quantity of micro-organisms are found\r\nin the vessels, in the villi, between the muscular bundles and in the\r\ndeeper layers of the intestinal walls; this is evidence that the\r\nprotective epithelial cells have been destroyed. The mesentery of cats,\r\npigs, and fowls, contains numerous small extravasations of blood. The\r\norgans generally, and especially the subcutaneous cellular tissue, are\r\ntinged with the colouring matters of the bile; this Kobert considers as\r\nevidence of weakened vitality of the red blood corpuscles. The walls of\r\nthe blood-vessels show hyaline degeneration, and give with iodine a\r\nquasi-amyloid reaction. The vessels are often partly filled with a\r\nhyaline mass, in which, at a later date, a fine black pigment appears.\r\nThese pigmented hyaline masses probably occlude the vessels, and hence\r\ncause gangrene.\r\n\r\n[611] _Lehrbuch der Intoxicationen_, by Dr. Rudolph Kobert, Stuttgart,\r\n1893.\r\n\r\nCornutin, according to Kobert, first excites the vagus; consequently\r\nthere is slow pulse and heightened blood pressure; then it paralyses the\r\nvaso-motor centre, and the pulse is accelerated. Severe convulsions,\r\npreceded by formication, follow. Paralysis of the extensor muscles, with\r\npermanent deformity, may result. Cornutin stimulates the uterus to\r\ncontraction, but it does not act so well in this respect alone as when\r\ngiven with sphacelic acid. In animals poisoned with cornutin, no special\r\npathological changes of a distinctive nature have been described.\r\n\r\n§ 587. =Separation of the Active Principles of Ergot from Animal\r\nTissues.=--There has been no experience in the separation of the\r\nconstituents of ergot from the organs of the body; an attempt might be\r\nmade on the principles detailed in page 425, but success is doubtful.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--Picrotoxin, the Active Principle of the Cocculus indicus (Indian\r\nBerry, Levant Nut).\r\n\r\n§ 588. The berries of the _Menispermum cocculus_ comprise at least three\r\ndefinite crystalline principles: _menispermine_,[612] _paramenispermine_\r\n(nitrogen containing bases), and _picrotoxin_, which possesses some of\r\nthe characters of an acid.\r\n\r\n[612] _Menispermine_ (C₁₈H₂₄N₂O₂?), discovered in 1834 by Pelletier and\r\nCourbe, is associated with a second named _paramenispermine_. The\r\npowdered berries are extracted by alcohol of 36°; the picrotoxin removed\r\nby hot water from the alcoholic extract; the menispermine and\r\nparamenispermine dissolved out together by acidulated water, and from\r\nthis solution precipitated by ammonia. The brown precipitate is\r\ndissolved by acetic acid, filtered, and again precipitated by ammonia.\r\nThis precipitate is dried, treated with cold alcohol, to separate a\r\nyellow resinous substance, and lastly with ether, which dissolves out\r\nthe menispermine, but leaves the paramenispermine.\r\n\r\nMenispermine forms white semi-transparent, four-sided, truncated prisms,\r\nmelting at 120°, decomposed at a higher temperature, insoluble in water,\r\nbut dissolving in warm alcohol and ether. Combined with 8 atoms of water\r\nit crystallises in needles and prisms. The crystals are without any\r\ntaste; in combination with acids, salts may be formed.\r\n\r\n_Paramenispermine_ forms four-sided prisms, or radiating crystalline\r\nmasses, melting at 250°, and subliming undecomposed. The crystals are\r\nsoluble in absolute ether, insoluble in water, and scarcely soluble in\r\nether.\r\n\r\n_Paramenispermine_ dissolves in acids, but apparently without forming\r\ndefinite salts.\r\n\r\n§ 589. =Picrotoxin= (C₃₀H₃₄O₁₃) was discovered in 1820 by Boullay. It is\r\nusually prepared by extracting the berries with boiling alcohol,\r\ndistilling the alcohol off, boiling the alcoholic residue with a large\r\nquantity of water, purifying the watery extract with sugar of lead,\r\nconcentrating the colourless filtrate by evaporation, and crystallising\r\nthe picrotoxin out of water.\r\n\r\nPicrotoxin crystallises out of water, and also out of alcohol, in\r\ncolourless, flexible, four-sided prisms, often arborescent, and\r\npossessing a silky lustre. They are unalterable in the air, soluble in\r\n150 parts of cold, and 25 parts of boiling water, dissolving easily in\r\nacidified water, in spirit, in ether, in amyl alcohol, and chloroform.\r\nThey are without smell, but have an extremely bitter taste. Caustic\r\nammonia is also a solvent.\r\n\r\nThe crystals are neutral in reaction. They melt at 192°-200° C. to a\r\nyellow mass; at higher temperatures giving off an acid vapour, with a\r\ncaramel-like odour, and lastly carbonising. Picrotoxin in cold\r\nconcentrated sulphuric acid dissolves with the production of a beautiful\r\ngold-yellow to saffron-yellow colour, which becomes on the addition of a\r\ntrace of potassic bichromate, violet passing into brown. An alcoholic\r\nsolution turns a ray of polarised light to the left [α]_{D} = -28·1°.\r\n\r\nPicrotoxin behaves towards strong bases like a weak acid. Its compounds\r\nwith the alkalies and alkaline earths are gummy and not easily obtained\r\npure. Compounds with quinine, cinchonine, morphine, strychnine, and\r\nbrucine can be obtained in the crystalline condition. Dilute sulphuric\r\nacid transforms it, with assimilation of water, into a weak gummy-like\r\nacid, which corresponds to the formula C₁₂H₁₆O₆. Nitric acid oxidises it\r\nto oxalic acid. Nitropicrotoxin and bromopicrotoxin, C₃₀H₃₃(NO₂)O₁₃, and\r\nC₃₀H₃₂Br₂O₁₃, can by appropriate treatment be obtained.\r\n\r\nConcentrated aqueous solutions of alkalies and ammonia decompose\r\npicrotoxin fully on warming. It reduces alkaline copper solution, and\r\ncolours bichromate of potash a beautiful green. The best test for its\r\npresence is, however, as follows:--The supposed picrotoxin is carefully\r\ndried, and mixed with thrice its bulk of saltpetre, the mixture\r\nmoistened with sulphuric acid, and then decomposed with soda-lye in\r\nexcess, when there is produced a transitory brick-red colour. For the\r\nreaction to succeed, the picrotoxin should be tolerably pure.\r\n\r\nSolutions of picrotoxin are not precipitated by the chlorides of\r\nplatinum, mercury, and gold, iodide of potassium, ferro- and\r\nferri-cyanides of potassium, nor by picric nor tannic acids.\r\n\r\n§ 590. =Fatal Dose.=--Vossler killed a cat in two hours with a dose of\r\n·12 grm. (1·8 grain); and another cat, with the same dose, died in 45\r\nminutes. Falck destroyed a young hound with ·06 grm. (·92 grain) in 24\r\nto 26 minutes. Given by subcutaneous or intravenous injection, it is, as\r\nmight be expected, still more lethal and rapid in its effects. In an\r\nexperiment of Falck’s, ·03 grm. (·46 grain), injected into a vein,\r\ndestroyed a strong hound within 20 minutes; ·016 grm. (·24 grain)\r\ninjected under the skin, killed a guinea-pig in 22 minutes; and ·012\r\ngrm. (·18 grain) a hare in 40 minutes. Hence it may be inferred that\r\nfrom 2 to 3 grains (12·9 to 19·4 centigrms.) would in all probability,\r\nbe a dangerous dose for an adult person.\r\n\r\n§ 591. =Effects on Animals.=--The toxic action of picrotoxin on fish and\r\nfrogs has been proposed as a test. The symptoms observed in fish are\r\nmainly as follows:--The fish, according to the dose, show uncertain\r\nmotions of the body, lose their balance, and finally float to the\r\nsurface, lying on one side, with frequent opening of the mouth and\r\ngill-covers. These symptoms are, however, in no way distinguishable from\r\nthose induced by any poisonous substance in the water, or by many\r\ndiseases to which fish are liable. Nevertheless, it may be conceded that\r\nin certain cases the test may be valuable--if, _e.g._, beer be the\r\nmatter of research, none of the methods used for the extraction of\r\npicrotoxin will be likely to extract any other substance having the\r\npoisonous action described on fish, so that, as a confirmatory test,\r\nthis may be of use.\r\n\r\nFrogs, under the influence of picrotoxin, become first uneasy and\r\nrestless, and then somewhat somnolent; but after a short time tetanic\r\nconvulsions set in, which might lead the inexperienced to imagine that\r\nthe animal was poisoned by strychnine. There is, however, one marked\r\ndistinction between the two--viz., that in picrotoxin poisoning an\r\nextraordinary swelling of the abdomen has been observed, a symptom\r\nwhich, so far as known, is due to picrotoxin alone. The frog is,\r\ntherefore, in this instance, the most suitable object for physiological\r\ntests.\r\n\r\nBeer extract containing picrotoxin is fatal to flies; but no definite\r\nconclusion can be drawn from this, since many bitter principles (notably\r\nquassia) are in a similar manner fatal to insect life.\r\n\r\n§ 592. =Effects on Man.=--Only two fatal cases of poisoning by\r\npicrotoxin are on record. In 1829 several men suffered from drinking rum\r\nwhich had been impregnated with _Cocculus indicus_; one died, the rest\r\nrecovered. In the second case, a boy, aged 12, swallowed some of a\r\ncomposition which was used for poisoning fish, the active principle of\r\nwhich was _Cocculus indicus_; in a few minutes the boy experienced a\r\nburning taste, he had pains in the gullet and stomach, with frequent\r\nvomiting, and diarrhœa. A violent attack of gastro-enteritis supervened,\r\nwith fever and delirium; he died on the nineteenth day. The\r\n_post-mortem_ signs were those usual in peritonitis: the stomach was\r\ndiscoloured, and its coats thinner and softer than was natural; there\r\nwere also other changes, but it is obvious that, as the death took place\r\nso long after the event, any pathological signs found are scarcely a\r\nguide for future cases.\r\n\r\n§ 593. =Physiological Action.=--The convulsions are considered to arise\r\nfrom an excitation of the medulla oblongata; the vagus centre is\r\nstimulated, and causes spasm of the glottis and slowing of the heart’s\r\naction during the attack. Röhrig also saw strong contraction of the\r\nuterus produced by _picrotoxin_. According to the researches of Crichton\r\nBrowne, _chloral hydrate_ acts in antagonism to picrotoxin, and prevents\r\nthe convulsions in animals if the dose of picrotoxin is not too large.\r\n\r\n§ 594. =Separation from Organic Matters.=--Picrotoxin is extracted from\r\naqueous acid solutions by either chloroform, amyl alcohol, or ether; the\r\nfirst is the most convenient. Benzene does not extract it, if employed\r\nin the same manner. On evaporation of the solvent the crude picrotoxin\r\ncan be crystallised out of water, and its properties examined.\r\n\r\nR. Palm[613] has taken advantage of the fact that picrotoxin forms a\r\nstable compound with freshly precipitated lead hydroxide, by applying\r\nthis property as follows:--the solution supposed to contain picrotoxin\r\nis evaporated to dryness, and the extract then taken up in a very little\r\nwater, acidified and shaken out with ether. The ether is evaporated,\r\nthe ethereal extract dissolved in a little water, the aqueous solution\r\nfiltered through animal charcoal, and precipitated by means of lead\r\nacetate, avoiding excess. The solution is filtered and shaken with\r\nfreshly prepared lead hydroxide. The lead hydroxide is dried and tested\r\ndirect for picrotoxin; if it does contain picrotoxin then on adding to\r\nit concentrated H₂SO₄ a beautiful saffron yellow is produced as bright\r\nas if the substance was pure picrotoxin.\r\n\r\n[613] _J. Pharm._, (5), xvii. 19-20.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--The Poison of Illicium Religiosum--A Japanese Plant.\r\n\r\n    § 595. A new poison belonging to the picrotoxin class has been\r\n    described by Dr. A. Langaard. In 1880, 5 children in Japan were\r\n    poisoned by the seeds of the _Illicium religiosum_; 3 of the\r\n    children died. Dr. Langaard then made various experiments on animals\r\n    with an active extract prepared by exhaustion with spirit, and\r\n    ultimate solution of the extract in water. Eykmann has also\r\n    imperfectly examined the chemistry of the plant, and has succeeded\r\n    in isolating a crystalline body which is not a glucoside; it is\r\n    soluble in hot water, in chloroform, ether, alcohol, and acetic\r\n    acid, but it is insoluble in petroleum ether; it melts at 175°, and\r\n    above that temperature gives an oily sublimate. Langaard’s\r\n    conclusions are that all parts of the plant are poisonous. The\r\n    poison produces excitation of the central apparatus of the medulla\r\n    oblongata and clonic convulsions analogous to those produced by\r\n    picrotoxin, toxiresin, and cicutoxin. Before the occurrence of\r\n    convulsions, the reflex excitability of frogs is diminished, the\r\n    respiratory centre is stimulated, hence frequency of the\r\n    respiration. Small doses cause slowing of the pulse through\r\n    stimulation of the vagus and of the peripheral terminations of the\r\n    vagus; in the heart the functional activity is later diminished.\r\n    Small doses kill by paralysing the respiratory centre, large by\r\n    heart paralysis. The proper treatment seems to be by chloral\r\n    hydrate, for when animals are poisoned by small lethal doses it\r\n    appears to save life, although when the dose is large it has no\r\n    effect.--_Ueber die Giftwirkung von Japanischem Sternanis_\r\n    (_Illicium religiosum_, Sieb.), _Virch. Archiv_, Bd. lxxxvi., 1881,\r\n    S. 222.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.--Picric Acid and Picrates.\r\n\r\n§ 596. =Picric Acid=,\r\n\r\n                  OH\r\n                 /\r\n  C₆H₃N₃O₇, or C₆H₂\r\n                \\\\\\\r\n                 (NO₂)₃\r\n\r\nis trinitrophenol; it forms a number of salts, all of which are more or\r\nless poisonous. Picric acid is much used in the arts, especially as a\r\ndye. The pure substance is in the form of pale yellow crystals, not very\r\nsoluble in cold water, but readily soluble in hot water, and readily\r\nsoluble in benzene, ether, and petroleum ether. The solution is yellow,\r\ntastes bitter, and dyes animal fibres, such as wool; but it can be\r\nwashed out of plant fibres such as cotton.\r\n\r\n§ 597. =Effects of Picric Acid.=--Picric acid and its salts have a\r\ntendency to decompose the elements of the blood, and to produce\r\nmethæmoglobin; picric acid is also an excitor of the nervous system,\r\nproducing convulsions. To these two effects must be added a third; in\r\nacid solution it has a strong affinity for albumin, so that if it meets\r\nwith an acid tissue it combines with the tissue, and in this way local\r\nnecroses are set up. The action on albumin is somewhat weakened by the\r\nreduction in the body of part of the picric acid to picraminic acid\r\nC₆H₂(NO₂)₂NH₂OH, a substance that does not so readily form compounds\r\nwith albuminous matters. Doses of 0·5 to 0·9 grm. (about 8 to 14 grains)\r\nmay be taken several days in succession without marked symptoms.\r\nUltimately, however, what is known as “picric jaundice” appears, the\r\nconjunctiva and the whole skin being stained more or less yellow. The\r\nurine, at first of a dark yellow, is later of a red brown colour.\r\nDyspepsia, with flatulence and an inclination to diarrhœa have been\r\nnoticed. A single dose of a gramme (15·4 grains) caused in a case\r\ndescribed by Adler[614] pain in the stomach, headache, weakness,\r\ndiarrhœa, vomiting of yellow matters, quickening and afterwards slowing\r\nof the pulse; the skin was of a brown yellow colour, and there were\r\nnervous symptoms. The urine was ruby red. In both fæces and urine picric\r\nacid could be recognised. The excretion of picric acid continued for six\r\ndays. A microscopical examination of the blood showed a diminution of\r\nthe red blood corpuscles, an increase in the white. Chéron[615] has\r\ndescribed a case in which the application of 0·45 grm. (6·9 grains) to\r\nthe vagina produced yellowness of the skin in an hour, and the urine was\r\nalso coloured red. Erythema, somnolence, burning and smarting in the\r\nstomach and in the kidneys were also noticed.\r\n\r\n[614] _Wiener. med. Woch._, 1880, 819.\r\n\r\n[615] J. Chéron, _Journ. de Thêr._, 1880, 121.\r\n\r\n§ 598. =Tests.=--Picric acid is easily separated from either tissues or\r\nother organic matters. These are acidified with sulphuric acid and then\r\ntreated with 95 per cent. alcohol; the alcohol is filtered off,\r\ndistilled, and the residue treated with ether; this last ethereal\r\nextract will contain any picric acid that may be present.\r\n\r\nIf the ether extract contains much impurity, it may be necessary to\r\ndrive off the ether, and to take up the residue with a little warm\r\nwater, then to cool, filter through a moistened filter paper, and test\r\nthe aqueous solution. Picric acid, warmed with KCN and KHO gives a\r\nblood-red colour, from the production of iso-purpurate of potash.\r\nAmmoniacal copper sulphate forms with picric acid yellow-green crystals\r\nwhich strongly refract the light. If a solution of picric acid be\r\nreduced by the addition of a hydrochloric acid solution of stannous\r\nchloride, the subsequent addition of ferric chloride produces a blue\r\ncolour, due to the formation of amidoimidophenol hydrochloride\r\nC₆H₂OH(NH₂)(NH)₂HCl.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.--Cicutoxin.\r\n\r\n§ 599. The _Cicuta virosa_, a not very common umbelliferous plant\r\ngrowing in moist places, is extremely poisonous. It is from 3 to 4 feet\r\nin height, with white flowers; the umbels are large, the leaves are\r\ntripartite, the leaflets linear lanceolate acute, serrate decurrent; the\r\ncalyx has five leaf-like teeth, the petals are obcordate with an inflex\r\npoint; the carpels have five equal broad flattened ridges with solitary\r\nstripes. Böhm[616] succeeded, in 1876, in separating an active principle\r\nfrom this plant. The root was dried, powdered, and exhausted with ether;\r\non evaporation of the ether the extract was taken up with alcohol, and\r\nafter several days standing the filtrate was treated with petroleum\r\nether; after removing the petroleum, the solution was evaporated to\r\ndryness in a vacuum; it was found to be a resinous mass, to which was\r\ngiven the name _cicutoxin_. It was fully soluble in alcohol, ether, or\r\nchloroform, and was very poisonous, but what its exact chemical nature\r\nmay be is still unknown.\r\n\r\n[616] _Arch. f. exp. Path._, Bd. v., 1876.\r\n\r\n§ 600. =Effects on Animals.=--Subcutaneously injected into frogs,\r\ncicutoxin acts something like picrotoxin, and something like the barium\r\ncompounds. Ten to fifteen minutes after the injection the animal assumes\r\na peculiar posture, holding the legs so that the thigh is stretched out\r\nfar from the trunk, and the leg at right angles with the thigh;\r\nvoluntary motion is only induced by the strongest stimuli, and when the\r\nfrog springs, he falls down plump with stiffly stretched-out limbs. The\r\nfrequency of breathing is increased, the muscles of the abdomen are\r\nthrown into contraction, and the lungs being full of air, on mechanical\r\nirritation there is a peculiar loud cry, depending upon the air being\r\nforced under the conditions detailed through the narrow glottis. Tetanic\r\nconvulsions follow, gradually paresis of the extremities appears, and,\r\nlastly, full paralysis and death; these symptoms are seen after doses of\r\nfrom 1 to 2 mgrms. The lethal dose for cats is about 1 centigrm. per\r\nkilo. Diarrhœa, salivation, and frequent breathing are first seen, and\r\nare followed by tonic and clonic convulsions, then there is an interval,\r\nduring which there is heightened excitability of reflex action, so that\r\nnoises will excite convulsions. Small doses by exciting the vagus slow\r\nthe pulse; larger doses quicken the pulse, and raise the arterial\r\npressure. Cicutoxin is supposed to act specially on the medulla\r\noblongata, while the spinal cord and the brain are only secondarily\r\naffected.\r\n\r\n§ 601. =Effects on Man.=--F. A. Falck was able to collect thirty-one\r\ncases of poisoning by cicuta; of these 14 or 45·2 per cent. died. The\r\nsymptoms are not dissimilar to those described in animals. There are\r\npain and burning in the stomach, nausea, vomiting, headache, and then\r\ntetanic convulsions. These, in some cases, are very severe, and resemble\r\nthose induced by strychnine; but in a few cases there is early coma\r\nwithout convulsions. There is also difficulty or absolute impossibility\r\nof swallowing. In fatal cases the respiration becomes stertorous, the\r\npulse small, the pupils dilated, and the face cyanotic, and death occurs\r\nwithin some four hours, and in a few cases later. The _fatal dose_ is\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\n§ 602. =Separation of Cicutoxin from the Body.=--An attempt might be\r\nmade to extract cicutoxin from the tissues on the same principles as\r\nthose by which it has been separated from the plant, and identified by\r\nphysiological experiments. In all recorded cases, identification has\r\nbeen neither by chemical nor physiological aids, but by the recognition\r\nof portions of the plant.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.--Æthusa Cynapium (Fool’s Parsley).\r\n\r\n§ 603. This plant has long been considered poisonous, and a number of\r\ncases are on record in which it is alleged that death or illness\r\nresulted from its use. Dr. John Harley,[617] however, in an elaborate\r\npaper, has satisfactorily proved the innocence of this plant, and has\r\nanalysed the cases on record. He has experimented on himself, on\r\nanimals, and on men, with the expressed juice and with the tincture. The\r\nresults were entirely negative: some of the published cases he refers to\r\nconium, and others to aconite.\r\n\r\n[617] _St. Thomas’ Hospital Reports_, N.S., 1875.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.--Œnanthe Crocata.\r\n\r\n§ 604. =The Water Hemlock.=[618]--This, a poisonous umbelliferous plant,\r\nindigenous to England, and growing in moist places such as ditches, &c.,\r\nis in flower in the month of August. It resembles somewhat celery, and\r\nthe root is something like the parsnip, for which it has been eaten. All\r\nparts of the plant are said to be poisonous, but the leaves and stalks\r\nonly slightly so, while the root is very deadly. We unfortunately know\r\nnothing whatever about the active principles of the plant, its\r\nchemistry has yet to be worked out. M. Toulmouche (_Gaz. Méd._, 1846)\r\nhas recorded, as the expert employed in the case, an attempt to murder\r\nby using the _œnanthe_ as a poison; a woman scraped the root into her\r\nhusband’s soup with evil intent, but the taste was unpleasant, and led\r\nto the detection of the crime. The root has been mistaken several times\r\nfor parsnip and other edible roots, and has thus led to poisonings. The\r\ncase of 36 soldiers poisoned in this way, in 1758, has been recorded by\r\nOrfila; there was one death. In 1803 three soldiers were poisoned at\r\nBrest--1 died. In Woolwich Bossey witnessed the poisoning of 21 convicts\r\nwho ate the roots and leaves of the plant--6 died. In 1858 there were\r\nseveral sailors poisoned in a similar way--2 died; while there have been\r\nnumerous cases in which the plant has been partaken of by children.\r\n\r\n[618] The earliest treatise on poisoning by the water-hemlock is by\r\nWepfer. _Cicutæ Aquat. Historia et Noxæ_, 1679; for cases see\r\nTrojanowsky, _Dorp. med. Ztg._, 1875; Meyer, _Med. Zeitg. f. Preussen_,\r\n1842; Schlesier in Casper’s _Wochenschrift_, 1843; Maly, _Œster. med\r\nWochenschr._, 1844; Badgeley, _Montreal med. Gaz._, 1844; Lender,\r\n_Viertelj. f. ger. Med._, 1865; Gampf, _Cöln. Pharm. Zeitg._, 1875; and\r\nthe treatises of Taylor and others.\r\n\r\n§ 605. The effects of the poison may be gathered from a case of\r\npoisoning[619] which occurred in 1882 at Plymouth; a Greek sailor, aged\r\nthirty, found on the coast what he considered “wild celery,” and ate\r\npart of the root and some of the stem. Two hours after this he ate a\r\ngood meal and felt perfectly well, but fifteen minutes later he suddenly\r\nand violently vomited; the whole contents of the stomach were completely\r\nevacuated. In five minutes he was completely unconscious, and had\r\nmuscular twitchings about the limbs and face. There was a copious flow\r\nof a thick tenacious mucus from the mouth which hung about the lips and\r\nclothing in viscid strings. Twenty-four hours after the poisoning he was\r\nadmitted into the South Devon Hospital apparently semi-comatose; his\r\nlegs dragged, and he had only feeble control of them; the extremities\r\nwere cold, but there was general free sweating. He could be roused only\r\nwith difficulty. There were no spasms, the pupils were dilated and\r\nsluggish, the respiration only 14 per minute. Twelve hours after\r\nadmission he became warmer, and perspired freely; he slept continuously,\r\nbut could easily be roused. On the following day he was quite conscious,\r\nand made a good recovery. Two companions who had also eaten a smaller\r\nquantity of the hemlock dropwort, escaped with some numbing sensations,\r\nand imperfect control over the extremities. In the Woolwich cases the\r\nsymptoms seem to have been something similar; in about twenty minutes,\r\none man, without any apparent warning, fell down in strong convulsions,\r\nwhich soon ceased, although he looked wild; a little while afterwards\r\nhis face became bloated and livid, his breathing stertorous and\r\nconvulsive, and he died in five minutes after the first symptoms had set\r\nin. A second died with similar symptoms in a quarter of an hour; a third\r\ndied in about an hour, a fourth in a little more than an hour; two other\r\ncases also proved fatal, one in nine days, the other in eleven. In the\r\ntwo last cases there were signs of intestinal irritation. The majority\r\nof the others fell down in a state of insensibility with convulsions,\r\nthe after-symptoms being more or less irritation of the intestinal\r\ncanal.\r\n\r\n[619] _Lancet_, Dec. 18, 1882.\r\n\r\n§ 606. =Post-mortem Appearances.=--It was noticed in the Woolwich cases\r\nthat those who died quickly had congestion of the cerebral vessels, and,\r\nin one instance, there was even extravasation of blood, but the man who\r\ndied first of all had no congestion of the cerebral vessels. The lining\r\nmembrane of the wind-pipe and air tubes was intensely injected with\r\nblood, and the lungs were gorged with fluid blood; the blood in the\r\nheart was black and fluid. The stomach and intestines were externally of\r\na pink colour. The mucous membrane of the stomach was much corrugated,\r\nand the follicles particularly enlarged. In the two protracted cases the\r\nstomach was not reddened internally, but the vessels of the brain were\r\ncongested.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.--Oil of Savin.\r\n\r\n§ 607. The leaves of the _Sabina communis_ (_Juniperus Sabina_), or\r\ncommon savin, an evergreen shrub to be found in many gardens, contains a\r\nvolatile oil, which has highly irritant properties. Savin leaves are\r\noccasionally used in medicine, maximum dose 1 grm. (15·4 grains). There\r\nis also a tincture--maximum dose 3 c.c. (about 45 mins.)--and an\r\nointment made by mixing eight parts of savin tops with three of yellow\r\nwax and sixteen parts of lard, melting and digesting for twenty minutes,\r\nand then straining through calico. The oil, a tincture, and an ointment,\r\nare officinal pharmaceutical preparations.\r\n\r\nThe oil of savin is contained to the extent of about 2 per cent. in the\r\nleaves and 10 per cent. in the fruit. It has a peculiar odour, its\r\nspecific gravity is ·89 to ·94, and it boils at 155° to 160°. An\r\ninfusion of savin leaves (the leaves being drunk with the liquid) is a\r\npopular and very dangerous abortive.\r\n\r\nIt is stated by Taylor that oil of savin has no abortive effect, save\r\nthat which is to be attributed to its general effect upon the system,\r\nbut this is erroneous. Röhrig found that, when administered to rabbits,\r\nit had a very evident effect upon the pregnant uterus, throwing it into\r\na tetanic contraction. The action was evident after destruction of the\r\nspinal cord. The plant causes great irritation and inflammation, whether\r\napplied to the skin or taken internally. The symptoms are excruciating\r\npain, vomiting, and diarrhœa, and the person dies in a kind of collapse.\r\n\r\nIn a case in which the author was engaged some years ago, a woman,\r\npregnant by a married man, took an unknown quantity of infusion of savin\r\ntops. She was violently sick, suffered great pain, with diarrhœa, and\r\ndied in about 26 hours. The pharynx was much reddened, and the gullet\r\neven congested; the stomach was inflamed, and contained some greenish\r\nmatter, in which the author was able to detect savin tops, as well as to\r\nseparate by distillation a few drops of a strong savin-like smelling\r\noil. The time which would elapse between the swallowing of the poison\r\nand the commencement of the pain was an important factor in this case,\r\nfor the man was accused of having supplied her with the infusion. From\r\nthe redness of the pharynx, and, generally, the rapid irritation caused\r\nby ethereal oils, the author was of opinion that but a few minutes must\r\nhave passed between the taking of the liquid and the sensation of\r\nconsiderable burning pain, although it is laid down in some works, as\r\nfor example Falck’s _Toxicologie_, that commonly the symptoms do not\r\ncommence for several hours. Symptoms which have been noticed in many\r\ncases are--some considerable irritation of the urinary organs, such as\r\nstrangury, bloody urine, &c.; in a few cases vomiting of blood, in\r\nothers anæsthesia, convulsions, and coma. Death may occur within 12\r\nhours, or may be postponed for two or three days.\r\n\r\n§ 608. =Post-mortem Appearances.=--More or less inflammation of the\r\nbowels, stomach, and intestinal tract, with considerable congestion of\r\nthe kidneys, are the signs usually found.\r\n\r\n§ 609. =Separation of the Poison and Identification.=--Hitherto reliance\r\nhas been placed entirely on the finding of the savin tops, or on the\r\nodour of the oil. There is no reliable chemical test.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.--Croton Oil.\r\n\r\n§ 610. Croton oil is an oil expressed from the seeds of _Croton\r\ntiglium_, a plant belonging to the natural order _Euphorbiaceæ_, growing\r\nin the West Indies. The seeds are oval in shape, not unlike castor-oil\r\nseeds, and about three-eighths of an inch in length. Both the seeds and\r\nthe oil are very poisonous. The chemical composition of croton oil can\r\nscarcely be considered adequately settled. The most recent view,\r\nhowever, seems to be that it contains a fixed oil (C₉H₁₄O₂) with certain\r\nglycerides.[620] On saponifying and decomposing the soap a series of\r\nvolatile fatty acids can be distilled over, the principal of which are\r\nmethyl crotonic acid, with small quantities of formic, acetic,\r\niso-butyric, valeric, and perhaps propionic, and other acids.[621] The\r\npeculiar properties of croton are due rather to the fixed oil than to\r\nthe volatile principles. The only officinal preparation in the British\r\npharmacopœia is a “_croton oil liniment_,” containing one part of croton\r\noil to seven of equal parts of oil of cajuput and rectified spirit.\r\n\r\n[620] G. Schmidt, _Arch. Pharm._ [3] 13, 213-229. Schlippe, Liebig’s\r\n_Annalen_, 105, 1. Geuther and Fröhlich, _Zeitschrift f. Chem._, 1870,\r\n26 and 549; _Journ. Chem. Society_, March 1879, p. 221.\r\n\r\n[621] Benedikt has found 0·55 per cent. of unsaponifiable matter in\r\ncroton oil. Lewkowitsch gives the iodine value 101·7 to 104·7, and\r\nsolidifying point as 18·6°-19·0°. (_Cheml. Analysis of the Oils, Fats,\r\nand Waxes_, by R. Benedikt, translated and enlarged by J. Lewkowitsch,\r\nLondon, 1895.)\r\n\r\n§ 611. =Dose.=--The oil is given medicinally as a powerful purgative in\r\ndoses up to 65 mgrms. (about a grain). It is used externally as an\r\nirritant or vesicant to the skin. A very dangerous dose would be from\r\nfifteen to twenty times the medicinal dose.\r\n\r\n=Effects.=--Numerous cases of poisoning from large doses of croton oil\r\nare recorded in medical literature, but the sufferers have mostly\r\nrecovered. The symptoms are pain, and excessive purging and vomiting.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a chemist,[622] who took half an ounce of impure croton\r\noil instead of cod-liver oil, the purging was very violent, and he had\r\nmore than a hundred stools in a few hours; there was a burning pain in\r\nthe gullet and stomach, the skin was cyanosed, the pupils dilated, and\r\ngreat faintness and weakness were felt, yet the man recovered. A child,\r\naged four, recovered from a teaspoonful of the oil given by mistake\r\ndirectly after a full meal of bread and milk. In five minutes there were\r\nvomiting and violent purging, but the child was well in two days. A\r\ndeath occurred in Paris, in 1839, in four hours after taking two and a\r\nhalf drachms of the oil. The symptoms of the sufferer, a man, were those\r\njust detailed, namely, burning pain in the stomach, vomiting, and\r\npurging. Singularly enough, no marked change was noticed in the mucous\r\nmembrane of the stomach when examined after death. An aged woman died in\r\n3 days from a teaspoonful of croton-oil embrocation; in this case there\r\nwere convulsions.\r\n\r\n[622] _Revue de Thérapeut._, May 1881.\r\n\r\nIn the case of _Reg._ v. _Massey and Ferraud_,[623] the prisoners were\r\ncharged with causing the death of a man, by poisoning his food with\r\njalap and six drops of croton oil. The victim, with others who had\r\npartaken of the food, suffered from vomiting and purging; he became\r\nbetter, but was subsequently affected with inflammation and ulceration\r\nof the bowels, of which he died. In this case it was not clear whether\r\nthe inflammation had anything to do with the jalap and croton oil or\r\nnot, and the prisoners were acquitted. In a criminal case in the United\r\nStates, a man, addicted to drink, was given, when intoxicated, 2 drachms\r\nof croton oil in a glass of whisky. He vomited, but was not purged, and\r\nin about twelve hours was found dead. The mucous membrane of the stomach\r\nand small intestines proved to be much inflamed, and in some parts\r\neroded, and croton oil was separated from the stomach.\r\n\r\n[623] _Orfila_, t. i. p. 108.\r\n\r\n§ 612. =Post-mortem Appearances.=--Inflammation of the stomach and\r\nintestines are the signs usually found in man and animals.\r\n\r\n§ 613. =Chemical Analysis.=--The oil may be separated from the contents\r\nof the stomach by ether. After evaporation of the ether, the blistering\r\nor irritant properties of the oil should be essayed by placing a droplet\r\non the inside of the arm.\r\n\r\n\r\nX.--The Toxalbumins of Castor-Oil Seeds and of Abrus.\r\n\r\n§ 614. =The Toxalbumin of Castor-Oil Seeds.=--In castor-oil seeds,\r\nbesides the well-known purgative oil, there exists an albuminous body\r\nintensely poisonous, which has been carefully investigated by\r\nStillmark,[624] under the direction of Kobert.[625] Injected into the\r\ncirculation it is more poisonous than strychnine, prussic acid, or\r\narsenic; and since the pressed seeds are without taste or smell, this\r\npoison has peculiar dangers of its own.\r\n\r\n[624] H. Stillmark, _Dorp. Arb._, Bd. iii., 1889.\r\n\r\n[625] Kobert’s _Lehrbuch_, 453-456.\r\n\r\nIt is essentially a blood poison, coagulating the blood.\r\n\r\nThe blood, if carefully freed from all fibrin, is yet again brought to\r\ncoagulation by a small amount of this body.\r\n\r\nIf castor-oil seeds are eaten, a portion of the poison is destroyed by\r\nthe digestive processes; a part is not thus destroyed, but is absorbed,\r\nand produces in the blood-vessels its coagulating property. Where this\r\ntakes place, ulcers naturally form, because isolated small areas are\r\ndeprived of their blood supply. These areas thus becoming dead, may be\r\ndigested by the gastric or intestinal fluids, and thus, weeks after,\r\ndeath may be produced. The symptoms noted are nausea, vomiting, colic,\r\ndiarrhœa, tenesmus, thirst, hot skin, frequent pulse, sweats, headache,\r\njaundice, and death in convulsions or from exhaustion. Animals may be\r\nmade immune by feeding them carefully with small doses, gradually\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\nThe _post-mortem_ appearances are ulceration in the stomach and\r\nintestines. In animals the appearances of hæmorrhagic gastro-enteritis,\r\nwith diffuse nephritis, hæmorrhages in the mesentery and so forth have\r\nbeen found.\r\n\r\n§ 615. =Toxalbumin of Abrus.=--A toxalbumin is found in the _Abrus\r\nprecatorius_ (Jequirity) which causes quite similar effects and\r\nsymptoms. That it is not identical is proved by the fact that, though\r\nanimals may become immune by repeated doses of Jequirity against\r\n“Abrin,” the similar substance from castor-oil seeds only confers\r\nimmunity against the toxalbumin of those seeds, and not against abrin;\r\nand similarly abrin confers no immunity against the castor albumin.\r\nEither of these substances applied to the conjunctiva produces\r\ncoagulation in the vessels and a secondary inflammation, to\r\nwhich in the case of jequirity has been given the name of\r\n“jequirity-ophthalmia.”[626]\r\n\r\n[626] Heinr. Hellin, _Der giftige Eiweisskorper-Abrin u. seine Wirkung\r\nauf das Blut. Inaug.-Diss._, Dorpat., 1891.\r\n\r\nThe general effect of these substances, and, above all, the curious fact\r\nthat a person may acquire by use a certain immunity from otherwise fatal\r\ndoses is so similar to poisonous products evolved in the system of\r\npersons suffering from infectious fevers, that they have excited of late\r\nyears much interest, and a study of their methods of action will throw\r\nlight upon many diseased processes.\r\n\r\nAt present there are no chemical means of detecting the presence of the\r\ntoxalbumins mentioned. Should they be ever used for criminal purposes,\r\nother evidence will have to be obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.--Ictrogen.\r\n\r\n§ 616. =Ictrogen.=--Various lupins, _e.g._, _Lupinus luteus_, _L.\r\nangustifolius_, _L. thermis_, _L. linifolius_, _L. hirsutus_, contain a\r\nsubstance of which nothing chemically is known, save that it may be\r\nextracted by weakly alkaline water, and which has been named “ictrogen”;\r\nthis must not be confused with the alkaloid of lupins named “lupinine,”\r\na bitter tasting substance. In large doses a nerve poison. Ictrogen has\r\nthe unusual property of acting much like phosphorus. It causes yellow\r\natrophy of the liver, and produces the following symptoms:--Intense\r\njaundice; at first enlargement of the liver, afterwards contraction;\r\nsomnolence, fever, paralysis. The urine contains albumen and the\r\nconstituents of the bile. After death there is found to be\r\nparenchymatous degeneration of the heart, kidneys, muscles, and liver.\r\nIf the animal has suffered for some time the liver may be cirrhotic.\r\n\r\nHitherto the cases of poisoning have been confined to animals. Many\r\nthousands of sheep and a few horses and deer have, according to Kobert,\r\ndied in Germany from eating lupin seeds. Further information upon the\r\nactive principles of lupins may be obtained by referring to the\r\nfollowing treatises:--G. Schneidemuhl, _Die lupinen Krankheit der\r\nSchafe_; _Vorträge f. Thierärzte_. Ser. 6, Heft. 4, Leipzig, 1883. C.\r\nArnold and G. Schneidemuhl, _Vierter Beitrag zur Klarstellung der\r\nUrsache u. des Wesens der Lupinose_, Luneburg, 1883; Julius Löwenthal,\r\n_Ueber die physiol. u. toxicol. Wirkungen der Lupinenalkaloide,\r\nInaug.-Diss._, Königsberg, 1888.\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.--Cotton Seeds.\r\n\r\n§ 617. Cotton seeds, used as an adulterant to linseed cake, &c., have\r\ncaused the death of sheep and calves. Cotton seeds contain a poison of\r\nwhich nothing is chemically known, save that it is poisonous. It\r\nproduces anæmia and cachexia in animals when given in small repeated\r\ndoses.\r\n\r\nAfter death the changes are, under these circumstances, confined to the\r\nkidney; these organs showing all the signs of nephritis. If, however,\r\nthe animal has eaten a large quantity of cotton seeds, then there is\r\ngastro-enteritis, as well as inflammation of the kidneys.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.--Lathyrus Sativus.\r\n\r\n§ 618. Various species of vetchlings, such as _L. sativus_, _L. cicera_,\r\n_L. clymenum_, are poisonous, and have caused an epidemic malady in\r\nparts of Spain, Africa, France, and Italy, among people who have eaten\r\nthe seeds. The symptoms are mainly referable to the nervous system,\r\ncausing a transverse myelitis and paraplegia. In this country it is\r\nchiefly known as a poisonous food for horses; the last instance of\r\nhorse-poisoning by lathyrus was that of horses belonging to the Bristol\r\nTramways and Carriage Company.[627] The company bought some Indian peas;\r\nthese peas were found afterwards to consist mainly of the seeds of\r\n_Lathyrus sativus_, for out of 335 peas no fewer than 325 were the seeds\r\nof _Lathyrus_. The new peas were substituted for the beans the horses\r\nhad been having previously on the 2nd November, and the horses ate them\r\nup to the 2nd December. Soon after the new food had been given, the\r\nhorses began to stumble and fall about, not only when at work, but also\r\nin their stalls; to these symptoms succeeded a paralysis of the larynx;\r\nthis paralysis was in some cases accompanied by a curious weird\r\nscreaming, which once having been heard could never be forgotten; there\r\nwas also gasping for breath and symptoms of impending suffocation. A few\r\nof the horses were saved by tracheotomy. Some died of suffocation; one\r\nhorse beat its brains out in its struggles for breath; 127 horses were\r\naffected; 12 died.\r\n\r\n[627] Bristol Tramways and Carriage Company _v._ Weston & Co., _Times_,\r\nJuly 17, 1894.\r\n\r\nThe above train of symptoms has also been recorded in similar cases;\r\nadded to which paralysis of the lower extremities is frequent. After\r\ndeath atrophy of the laryngeal muscles, wasting of the nervus recurrens,\r\nand atrophy of the ganglion cells of the vagus nucleus as also of the\r\nmultipolar ganglion cells in the anterior horns of the spinal cord have\r\nbeen found.\r\n\r\nThe active principle of the seeds has not been satisfactorily isolated.\r\nThe symptoms suggest the action of a toxalbumin. Teilleux found a resin\r\nacid; Louis Astier a volatile alkaloid, and he explains the fact that\r\nthe seeds, after being heated, are no longer poisonous by the\r\ndissipation of this alkaloid.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.--Arum--Bryony--Locust Tree--Male Fern.\r\n\r\n§ 619. =Arum maculatum=, the common cuckoo-pint, flowering in April and\r\nMay, and frequent in the hedges of this country, is extremely poisonous.\r\nBright red succulent attractive berries are seen on a single stalk, the\r\nrest of the plant having rotted away, and these berries are frequently\r\ngathered by children and eaten. The poison belongs to the class of acrid\r\nirritants, but its real nature remains for investigation.\r\n\r\nSome of the species of the same natural order growing in the tropics are\r\nfar more intensely poisonous.\r\n\r\n§ 620. =The Black Bryony.=--_Tamus communis_, the black bryony, a common\r\nplant by the wayside, flowering in May and June, possesses poisonous\r\nberries, which have been known to produce death, with symptoms of\r\ngastro-enteritis. In smaller doses the berries are stated to produce\r\nparalysis of the lower extremities.[628]\r\n\r\n[628] Contagne, _Lyon med._, xlvi., 1884, 239.\r\n\r\n§ 621. =The Locust Tree.=--The _Robinia pseudo-acacia_, a papilionaceous\r\ntree, contains a poison in the leaves and in the bark. R. Coltmann [629]\r\nhas recorded a case in China of a woman, twenty-four years of age, who,\r\nat a time of famine, driven by hunger, ate the leaves of this tree. She\r\nbecame ill within forty-eight hours, with high fever; the tongue swelled\r\nand there was much erysipelatous-like infiltration of the tissues of the\r\nmouth; later the whole body became swollen. There was constipation and\r\nso much œdema of the eyelids that the eyeballs were no longer visible.\r\nRecovery took place without special treatment. Power and Cambier[630]\r\nhave separated from the bark an albumose, which is intensely poisonous,\r\nand is probably the cause of the symptoms detailed.\r\n\r\n[629] _Medical and Surgical Reporter_, lxi., 1889.\r\n\r\n[630] _Pharm. Journ._, 1890, 711.\r\n\r\n§ 622. =Male Fern.=--An ethereal extract of _Aspidium Filix mas_ is used\r\nas a remedy against tape worm.\r\n\r\nPoullson[631] has collected up to the year 1891 sixteen cases of\r\npoisoning by male fern; from which it would appear that 7 to 10 grms.\r\n(103 to 154 grains) of the extract may be fatal to a child, and 45 grms.\r\n(rather more than 1½ oz.) to an adult. The active principle seems to be\r\nfilicic acid and the ethereal oil. Filicic acid, under the influence of\r\nsaponifying agencies, breaks up into butyric acid and phloroglucin.\r\n\r\n[631] _Arch. exp. P._, Bd. 29.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms produced are pain, heaviness of the limbs, faintness,\r\nsomnolence, dilatation of the pupil, albuminuria, convulsions, lock-jaw,\r\nand collapse. In animals there have also been noticed salivation,\r\namaurosis, unsteady gait, dragging of the hind legs, dyspnœa, and\r\nparalysis of the breathing centres. The _post-mortem_ appearances which\r\nhave been found are as follows:--Redness and swelling with hæmorrhagic\r\nspots of the mucous membranes of the stomach and intestines; acute œdema\r\nof the brain and spinal cord with petechia in the meninges; the kidneys\r\ninflamed, the liver and spleen congested, and the lungs œdematous.\r\n\r\nThere is no characteristic reaction for male fern; the research most\r\nlikely to be successful is to attempt to separate from an ethereal\r\nextract filicic acid, and to decompose it into butyric acid and\r\nphloroglucin; the latter tinges red a pine splinter moistened with\r\nhydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART VII.--POISONS DERIVED FROM LIVING OR DEAD ANIMAL SUBSTANCES.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIVISION I.--POISONS SECRETED BY LIVING ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--Poisonous Amphibia.\r\n\r\n§ 623. The glands of the skin of certain amphibia possess a secretion\r\nthat is poisonous; the animal is unable to empty the poison glands by\r\nany voluntary act, but the secretion can readily be obtained by\r\npressure. Zalesky found the juice in the skin glands of the _Salamandra\r\nmaculosa_, milky, alkaline in reaction, and bitter in taste. He isolated\r\nfrom it an organic base, which he named _Salamandrine_ (C₃₄H₆₀N₂O₅), it\r\nis soluble in water and in alcohol, and forms salts. Salamandrine is a\r\nstrong poison; injected subcutaneously into rabbits it causes shivering,\r\nepileptiform convulsions, and salivation; then tetanus, followed by\r\noppressed respiration, dilated pupils, and anæsthesia. Death occurs\r\nafter a kind of paralytic state. When given to dogs, it causes vomiting.\r\nIn frogs, tetanus occurs first and then paralysis--the result of all the\r\nexperiments being that salamandrine acts on the brain and spinal cord,\r\nleaving the heart and muscular substance unaffected. A similar secretion\r\nobtained from the water salamander (_Triton cristatus_), causes,\r\naccording to Vulpian, the death of dogs in from three to eighteen hours;\r\nthe symptoms being progressive weakness, slowing of the respiration, and\r\ndepression of the heart’s action.\r\n\r\n§ 624. The secretion of the skin of the common toad contains\r\nmethylcarbylaminic acid, carbylamine, and, according to Fornara, an\r\nalkaloid which is soluble in alcohol, and to which the name of\r\n_phrynine_ has been applied; its action is toxic on all animals\r\nexperimented upon, save toads. Administered subcutaneously to frogs, it\r\nhas a digitalis-like action, causing rapid paralysis of the heart, and\r\nthe breathing soon after ceases; the muscles become early rigid.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--The Poison of the Scorpion.\r\n\r\n§ 625. There are several species of scorpions. The small European\r\nvariety (_Scorpio europæus_) is found in Italy, the south of France, and\r\nthe Tyrol; the African scorpion (_Bothus afer_, L.), which attains the\r\nlength of 16 cm., is found in Africa and the East Indies; _Androctonus\r\nbicolor_ in Egypt; and the _Androctonus occitanus_ in Spain, Italy,\r\nGreece, and North Africa.\r\n\r\nIn the last joint of the tail the scorpion is provided with a poisonous\r\napparatus, consisting of two oval glands, the canal of which leads into\r\na round bladder, and this last is connected with a sting. When the sting\r\nis inserted, the bladder contracts, and expels the poison through the\r\nhollow sting into the wound. The smaller kinds of scorpion sting with as\r\nlittle general effect as a hornet, but the large scorpion of Africa is\r\ncapable of producing death. There is first irritation about the wound,\r\nand an erysipelatous inflammation, which may lead to gangrene. Vomiting\r\nand diarrhœa then set in, with general weakness and a fever, which may\r\nlast from one to one and a half days; in the more serious cases there\r\nare fainting, delirium, coma, convulsions, and death. According to G.\r\nSanarelli[632] the blood corpuscles of birds, fishes, frogs, and\r\nsalamanders are dissolved by the poison; only the nucleus remaining\r\nintact; the blood corpuscles of warm-blooded animals are not affected.\r\n\r\n[632] G. Sanarelli, _Bollet. della Soc. della sez. dei cult. delle\r\nScienze med._, v., 1888, 202.\r\n\r\nValentin made some experiments on frogs with the _Androctonus\r\noccitanus_. He found that soon after the sting the animal remains quiet,\r\nbut on irritation it moves, and is thrown into a transitory convulsion;\r\nto this follow twitchings of single muscular bundles. The frog is\r\nprogressively paralysed, and the reflex irritability is gradually\r\nextinguished from behind forwards; at first the muscles may be excited\r\nby electrical stimuli to the nerves, but later they are only capable of\r\ncontraction by direct stimuli.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--Poisonous Fish.\r\n\r\n§ 626. A large number of fish possess poisonous properties; in some\r\ncases the poison is local; in others the poison is in all parts of the\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nMany fish are provided with poison glands in connection with the fins or\r\nspecial weapons, and such are used for purposes of defence; for example,\r\n_Synanceia brachio_ is provided with a back fin consisting of 13 spines,\r\neach of which has two poison reservoirs; the reservoirs are connected\r\nwith 10 to 12 tubular glands which secrete the poison, a clear feebly\r\nacid bluish fluid, exciting in a concentrated condition, local gangrene;\r\nin a diluted one, paralysis of the nervous centres.\r\n\r\nAnother kind of localisation is the localisation in certain of the\r\ninternal organs. Remy states, that there are twelve varieties of\r\n_Tetrodon_ in Japanese waters, all of which are poisonous. M. Minra and\r\nK. Takesaki[633] find that the poison of the _Tetrodon_ is confined to\r\nthe sexual organs of the female, and at the time of activity of these\r\nglands, the poisonous properties are most intense; but, even in winter,\r\nwhen the glands are atrophied, Remy found the glands were so poisonous\r\nthat he could prepare from them a fluid, which, administered\r\nsubcutaneously, killed dogs within two hours. The symptoms in the dog\r\nare restlessness, salivation, vomiting of slimy masses, dilatation of\r\nthe pupil, paralysis and great dyspnœa. Death occurs by the lung. After\r\ndeath the appearances are similar to those from asphyxia; in addition to\r\nwhich there are small ecchymoses in the stomach and intestines; the\r\nsalivary glands and pancreas are also injected. The symptoms observed in\r\nman are similar, there is headache, dilated pupils, vomiting, sometimes\r\nhæmatamesis, convulsions, paralysis, dyspnœa and death.\r\n\r\n[633] Virchow’s _Archiv_, 1890, Bd. 122.\r\n\r\nSome fishes are poisonous on account of the food they live upon; the\r\n_Meletta venenosa_ is only poisonous when it feeds upon a certain green\r\nmonad; _Clupea thrissa_, _C. venenosa_ and certain species of _Scarus_,\r\nneither possess poison glands nor poisonous ovaries; but also derive\r\ntheir poisonous properties from their food. In the West Indies it is\r\nwell-known that fish caught off certain coral banks are unwholesome,\r\nwhile the same species caught elsewhere may be eaten with safety.\r\n\r\nA good many shell-fish, especially mussels, occasionally cause intense\r\npoisonous symptoms; those usually noticed are high fever, nettle rash,\r\ndilated pupils, and diarrhœa. It may be that in these cases a ptomaine,\r\nthe product of bacterial action, has been ingested. To the agency of\r\nbacteria has been ascribed illness produced in Russia by a good many\r\nfish of the sturgeon species. The symptoms are those of cerebro-spinal\r\nparalysis. The “Icthyismus gastricus” of Germany may belong to the same\r\ntype. Prochorow[634] has described illness from ingestion of _Petromyzon\r\nfluviatilis_ in Russia. Whether the fish was eaten raw or cooked, the\r\neffect was the same, producing a violent diarrhœa, dysenteric in\r\ncharacter. Even the broth in which the fish had been boiled produced\r\nsymptoms. Fresh blood of the eel is stated to be intensely poisonous;\r\nthis property is apparently due to a toxalbumin; Pennavaria[635] relates\r\nthe case of a man who took, in 200 c.c. of wine, 0·64 kilo. of fresh eel\r\nblood and suffered from diarrhœa with symptoms of collapse.\r\n\r\n[634] _Pharmac. Ztg._, 1885.\r\n\r\n[635] _Il Farmacista Italiano_, xii., 1888.\r\n\r\nIn the _Linnean Transactions_ for November, 1860, is recorded a fatal\r\naccident, which took place on board the Dutch ship “Postillion” at\r\nSimon’s Bay, Cape of Good Hope. The boatswain and purser’s steward\r\npartook of the liver of the _toad_ or _ball-bladder_ (_Diodon_); within\r\ntwenty minutes the steward died; in ten minutes the boatswain was\r\nviolently ill; the face flushed, the eyes glistening, and the pupils\r\ncontracted; there was cyanosis of the face, the pulse was weak and\r\nintermittent, and swallowing was difficult, the breathing became\r\nembarrassed, and the body generally paralysed. Death took place in\r\nseventeen minutes. The liver of one fish only is said to have been\r\neaten. This might weigh 4 drachms. If the account given is literally\r\ncorrect, the intensity of the poison equals that of any known substance.\r\n\r\nThe poisonous nature of the goby has also led to several accidents, and\r\nwe possess a few experiments made by Dr. Collas,[636] who fed chickens\r\nwith different parts of the fish, and proved that all parts were alike\r\npoisonous. The effects were slow in developing; they commenced in about\r\nan hour or an hour and a half, and were well developed in five hours,\r\nmainly consisting of progressive muscular weakness and prostration.\r\nDeath occurred without convulsions.\r\n\r\n[636] _Soc. Sci. Rev._, July 19, 1862; _Brit. and For. Med. Chir. Rev._,\r\nOct. 1862, p. 536.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.--Poisonous Spiders and Other Insects.\r\n\r\n§ 627. It is probable that all spiders are poisonous; the only species,\r\nhowever, of which we have any definite information relative to their\r\npoisonous properties, are _Lycosa tarantula_ and the _Latrodectus\r\nmalmignatus_, to which may be added the New Zealand _katipo_. These\r\nspiders possess a poisonous gland connected with their masticatory\r\napparatus, which secretes a clear, oily, bitter acid-reacting fluid; the\r\nacidity seems due to formic acid.\r\n\r\nZangrilli has observed several cases of tarantula bite; soon after the\r\noccurrence the part bitten is anæsthetic, after a few hours there are\r\nconvulsive shiverings of the legs, cramps of the muscles, inability to\r\nstand, spasm of the pharyngeal muscles, quickening of the pulse, and a\r\nthree days’ fever, with vomiting of yellow, bilious matter; recovery\r\nfollows after copious perspiration. In one case there was tetanus, and\r\ndeath on the fourth day. The extraordinary effects attributed to the\r\nbite of the tarantula, called _tarantism_ in the Middle Ages, are well\r\ndetailed by Hecker;[637] this excitement was partly hysterical and\r\npartly delirious, and has not been observed in modern times.\r\n\r\n[637] “The Epidemics of the Middle Ages,” by J. F. C. Hecker, translated\r\nby B. G. Babington, M.D., F.R.S. (_The Dancing Mania_, chap, ii., &c.)\r\n\r\nDax has described the effects of the bite of the _L. malmignatus_; it\r\noccasioned headache, muscular weakness, pain in the back, cramps, and\r\ndyspnœa; the symptoms disappeared after several days.\r\n\r\n§ 628. The _katipo_ is a small poisonous spider confined to New Zealand.\r\nMr. W. H. Wright has recorded the case of a person who, in 1865, was\r\nbitten by this spider on the shoulder. The part rapidly became swollen,\r\nand looked like a large nettle-rash wheal; in an hour the patient could\r\nhardly walk, the respiration and circulation were both affected, and\r\nthere was great muscular prostration; but he recovered in a few hours.\r\nIn other cases, if the accounts given are to be relied upon, the bite of\r\nthe spider has produced a chronic illness, accompanied by wasting of the\r\nbody, followed by death after periods varying from six weeks to three\r\nmonths.[638]\r\n\r\n[638] _Transac. of the New Zealand Inst._, vol. ii., 1869; _Brit. and\r\nFor. Med. Chir. Review_, July 1871, p. 230.\r\n\r\n§ 629. =Ants.=--The various species of ants possess at the tail special\r\nglands which secrete _formic acid_. Certain exotic species of ants are\r\nprovided with a sting, but the common ant of this country has no special\r\npiercing apparatus. The insect bites, and then squirts the irritating\r\nsecretion into the wound, causing local symptoms of swelling and\r\ninflammation.\r\n\r\n§ 630. =Wasps, &c.=--Wasps, bees, and hornets all possess a poison-bag\r\nand sting. The fluid secreted is as clear as water, and of an acid\r\nreaction; it certainly contains formic acid, with some other poisonous\r\nconstituent. An erysipelatous inflammation generally arises round the\r\nsting, and in those cases in which persons have been attacked by a swarm\r\nof bees, signs of general poisoning, such as vomiting, fainting,\r\ndelirium, and stupor, have been noticed. Death has occasionally\r\nresulted.\r\n\r\n§ 631. =Cantharides.=--Commercial cantharides is either the dried\r\nentire, or the dried and powdered blister-beetle, or Spanish fly\r\n(_Cantharis vesicatoria_). The most common appearance is that of a\r\ngreyish-brown powder, containing shining green particles, from which\r\ncantharidin is readily extracted by exhausting with chloroform, driving\r\noff the chloroform by distillation or evaporation, and subsequently\r\ntreating the extract with bisulphide of carbon, which dissolves the\r\nfatty matters only. Finally, the cantharidin may be recrystallised from\r\nchloroform, the yield being ·380 to ·570 per cent. Ferrer found in the\r\nwings and their cases, ·082 per cent.; in the head and antennæ, ·088; in\r\nthe legs, ·091; in the thorax and abdomen, ·240; in the whole insect,\r\n·278 per cent. Wolff found in the _Lytta aspera_, ·815 per cent.; Ferrer\r\nin _Mylabris cichorei_, ·1 per cent.; in _M. punctum_, ·193; and in _M.\r\npustulata_, ·33 per cent. of _cantharidin_.\r\n\r\n§ 632. =Cantharidin= (C₁₀H₁₂O₄) has two crystalline forms--(1)\r\nRight-angled four-sided columns with four surfaces, each surface being\r\nbeset with needles; and (2) flat tables. It is the anhydride of a ketone\r\nacid (cantharidic acid), C₈H₁₃O₂-CO-COOH. It is soluble in alkaline\r\nliquids, and can be recovered from them by acidifying and shaking up\r\nwith _ether_, _chloroform_, or _benzene_; it is almost completely\r\ninsoluble in water. 100 parts of alcohol (99 per cent.) dissolve at 18°\r\n0·125 part; 100 of bisulphide of carbon, at the same temperature, 0·06\r\npart; ether, ·11 part; chloroform, 1·2 part; and benzene, ·2 part.\r\nCantharidin can be completely sublimed, if placed in the subliming cell\r\n(described at p. 258), floating on mercury; a scanty sublimate of\r\ncrystals may be obtained at so low a temperature as 82·5°; at 85°, and\r\nabove, the sublimation is rapid. If the cantharidin is suddenly heated,\r\nit melts; but this is not the case if the temperature is raised\r\ngradually. The tube melting-point is as high as 218°. Potassic chromate\r\nwith sulphuric acid decomposes cantharidin with the production of the\r\ngreen oxide of chromium. An alkaline solution of permanganate, iodic\r\nacid, and sodium amalgam, are all without influence on an alcoholic\r\nsolution of cantharidin. With bases, cantharidin forms crystallisable\r\nsalts, and, speaking generally, if the base is soluble in water, the\r\n“_cantharidate_” is also soluble; the lime and magnesic salts dissolve\r\nreadily. From the soda or potash salt, mineral acid will precipitate\r\ncrystals of cantharidin; on heating with pentasulphide of phosphorus,\r\no-xylol is produced.\r\n\r\n§ 633. =Pharmaceutical Preparations of Cantharides.=--The P.B.\r\npreparations of cantharides are--_Acetum cantharides_, or vinegar of\r\ncantharides, containing about ·04 per cent. of cantharidin.\r\n\r\n_Tincture of cantharides_, containing about ·005 per cent. of\r\ncantharidin.\r\n\r\nA solution of cantharides for blistering purposes, _Liquor\r\nepispasticus_, a strong solution of the active principle in ether and\r\nacetic acid, containing about ·16 per cent. of cantharidin.\r\n\r\nThere are also--An _ointment_; a blistering paper, _Charta epispastica_;\r\na blistering plaster, _Emplastrum cantharides_; and a warm plaster,\r\n_Emplastrum calefaciens_.\r\n\r\n§ 634. =Fatal Dose.=--It is difficult to state the fatal dose of\r\ncantharidin, the unassayed powder or tincture having mostly been taken.\r\nA young woman died from 1·62 grm. (25 grains) of the powder, which is\r\nperhaps equivalent to 6·4 mgrms. (1 grain) of cantharidin, whilst the\r\nsmallest dose of the tincture known to have been fatal is (according to\r\nTaylor) an ounce. This would be generally equivalent to 15 mgrms. (·24\r\ngrain). Hence the fatal dose of cantharidin may be approximately stated\r\nas from 6 mgrms. upwards. But, on the other hand, recovery has taken\r\nplace from very large doses.\r\n\r\n§ 635. =Effects on Animals.=--Certain animals do not appear susceptible\r\nto the action of cantharidin. For example, hedgehogs and swallows are\r\nsaid to be able to take it with impunity. Radecki[639] found that\r\ncantharidin might even be injected into the blood of fowls without any\r\ninjury, and frogs also seem to enjoy the same impunity; while dogs,\r\ncats, and other animals are sensitive to the poison. Galippe ascertained\r\nthat after the injection of 5 mgrms. into the veins of a dog, there was\r\nexaltation of the sexual desire; the pupils quickly dilated, the dog\r\nsought a dark place, and became sleepy. Animals when poisoned die in\r\nasphyxia from paralysis of the respiratory centre. Schachowa[640] made\r\nsome observations on the effect of cantharides on the renal excretion of\r\na dog fed daily with 1 grm. in powder. On the third day, pus corpuscles\r\nwere noticed; on the fifth, bacteria; on the thirteenth, the urine\r\ncontained a large quantity of fatty matters, and several casts; and on\r\nthe seventeenth, red shrivelled blood corpuscles were observed.\r\n\r\n[639] _Die Cantharidin Vergift._, Diss., Dorpat, 1806.\r\n\r\n[640] _Unters. über die Nieren_, Diss., Bern, 1877; Cornil, _Gaz. Méd._,\r\n1880.\r\n\r\n=Effects on Man.=--Heinrich[641] made the following experiments upon\r\nhimself:--Thirty living blister-beetles were killed, and digested,\r\nwithout drying, in 35 grms. of alcohol for fourteen days, of this\r\ntincture ten drops were taken. There ensued immediately a feeling of\r\nwarmth in the mouth and stomach, salivation, the pulse was more frequent\r\nthan in health, there was a pleasant feeling of warmth about the body,\r\nand some sexual excitement lasting three hours. In half an hour there\r\nwas abdominal pain, diarrhœa, and tenesmus, and frequent painful\r\nmicturition. These symptoms subsided in a few hours, but there was a\r\nwant of appetite, and pain about the kidneys lasting until the following\r\nday. In the second experiment, on taking 1 cgrm. of cantharidin, there\r\nwere very serious symptoms of poisoning. Blisters formed on the tongue,\r\nand there was salivation, with great difficulty in swallowing, and a\r\ngeneral feeling of illness. Seven hours after taking the poison, there\r\nwere frequent micturitions of bloody urine, diarrhœa, and vomiting.\r\nTwenty hours after the ingestion the face was red, the skin hot, the\r\npulse twenty beats beyond the normal pulsation, the tongue was denuded\r\nto two-thirds of its extent of its epithelium, and the lips and mucous\r\nmembrane were red and swollen; there was great pain in the stomach,\r\nintestines, and in the neighbourhood of the kidneys, continuous desire\r\nto micturate, burning of the urethra, and swelling of the glands. There\r\nwas no sexual excitement whatever; the urine was ammoniacal, and\r\ncontained blood and pus; the symptoms gradually subsided, but recovery\r\nwas not complete for fourteen days.\r\n\r\n[641] Schroff, _Zeitschrift d. Ges. d. Aerzte in Wien_, 13, 56.\r\n\r\n§ 636. The foregoing is a fair picture of what may be expected in\r\ncantharides poisoning. It is remarkable that the popular idea as to the\r\ninfluence of cantharidin in exciting the sexual passion, holds good only\r\nas to the entire cantharides, and not with cantharidin. It is very\r\npossible that cantharidin is not the only poisonous principle in the\r\ninsect. The symptoms in other cases, fatal or not, have been as\r\nfollows:--Immediate burning in the mouth and throat, extending to the\r\nstomach and alimentary canal, and increasing in intensity until there is\r\nconsiderable pain. Then follow salivation, difficulty in swallowing, and\r\nvomiting, and generally diarrhœa, pain in the kidneys, irritation of the\r\nbladder, priapism, and strangury, are all present. The pulse is\r\naccelerated, the breathing disturbed, there are pains in the head, and\r\noften mydriasis, giddiness, insensibility, delirium, and convulsions;\r\ntrismus has been noticed. The desire to micturate frequently is urgent,\r\nthe urine is generally bloody, and contains pus. Pregnant women have\r\nbeen known to abort. In a few of the cases in which a different course\r\nhas been run, the nervous symptoms have predominated over those of\r\ngastro-intestinal irritation, and the patient has sunk in a kind of\r\ncollapse. In a case of chronic poisoning by cantharides, extending over\r\nthree months, and recorded by Tarchioni Bonfanti,[642] after the first\r\ndose appeared tetanic convulsions, which subsided in twenty-four hours,\r\nthere was later cystitis, and from time to time the tetanic convulsions\r\nreturned; gastro-enteritis followed with frequent vomiting, when,\r\ncantharides being found in the matters ejected, the otherwise obscure\r\nnature of the illness was shown.\r\n\r\n[642] _Gaz. Med. Ital. Lomb._, 1863.\r\n\r\nIn a case recorded by Sedgwick,[643] following the gastro-enteric\r\nsymptoms, there were epileptic convulsions; in this instance also was\r\nnoticed an unpleasant smell, recalling the notion formerly held that\r\ncantharides imparted a peculiar odour to the breath and urine. In a case\r\nof chronic poisoning related by Tardieu, six students, during several\r\nmonths, used what they thought was pepper with their food, but the\r\nsubstance proved to be really powdered cantharides. The quantity taken\r\neach day was probably small, but they suffered from pain about the\r\nloins, and also irritation of the bladder. There was no sexual\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\n[643] _Med. Times_, 1864.\r\n\r\n§ 637. =Post-mortem Appearances.=--In a French criminal case, in which a\r\nman poisoned his step-brother by giving cantharides in soup, the\r\npathological signs of inflammation of the gastro-intestinal tract were\r\nspecially evident, the mouth was swollen, the tonsils ulcerated, the\r\ngullet, stomach, and intestines were inflamed, and the mucous membrane\r\nof the intestines covered with purulent matter. In another case there\r\nwas an actual perforation 3 inches from the pylorus. The inflammatory\r\nappearances, however, are not always so severe, being confined to\r\nswelling and inflammation without ulceration. In all cases there has\r\nbeen noted inflammation of the kidneys and urinary passages, and this is\r\nseen even when cantharidin is administered to animals by subcutaneous\r\ninjection. In the urine will be found blood and fatty epithelial casts,\r\nas well as pus. The contents of the stomach or the intestines will\r\nprobably contain some remnants of powdered cantharides, if the powder\r\nitself has been taken.\r\n\r\n§ 638. =Tests for Cantharidin, and its Detection in the Tissues,\r\n&c.=--The tests for cantharidin are--(1.) Its form, (2.) its action in\r\nthe subliming cell, and (3.) its power of raising a blister.\r\n\r\nThe most convenient method of testing its vesicating properties, is to\r\nallow a chloroformic solution of the substance supposed to be\r\ncantharidin to evaporate to dryness, to add to this a drop of olive oil\r\n(or almond oil), and to take a drop up on the smallest possible quantity\r\nof cotton wool, and apply the wool to the inside of the arm, covering it\r\nwith good oilskin, and strapping the whole on by the aid of\r\nsticking-plaster. In about an hour or more the effect is examined. The\r\nthin skin of the lips is far more easily blistered than that of the arm,\r\nbut the application there is inconvenient.\r\n\r\nDragendorff has ascertained that cantharidin is not present in the\r\ncontents of a blister raised by a cantharides plaster, although it has\r\nbeen found in the urine of a person treated by one; and Pettenkofer has\r\nalso discovered cantharidin in the blood of a boy to whose spine a\r\nblister had been applied.\r\n\r\nThe great insolubility of cantharidin in water has led to various\r\nhypotheses as to its absorption into the system. It is tolerably easily\r\ndissolved by potash, soda, and ammonia solutions, and is also taken up\r\nin small proportion by sulphuric, phosphoric, and lactic acids. The\r\nresulting compounds quickly diffuse themselves through animal membranes.\r\nEven the salts with lime, magnesia, alumina, and the heavy metals, are\r\nnot quite insoluble. A solution of salt with cantharidin, put in a\r\ndialysing apparatus, separates in twenty-four hours enough cantharidin\r\nto raise a blister.\r\n\r\nCantharidin has actually been discovered in the heart, brain, muscles,\r\ncontents of the stomach, intestines, and fæces (as well as in the blood\r\nand urine) of animals poisoned by the substance. A urine containing\r\ncantharidin is alkaline and albuminous. Cantharidin, although readily\r\ndecomposed by chemical agents, is so permanent in the body that it has\r\nbeen detected in the corpse of a cat eighty-four days after death.\r\n\r\nIn any forensic case, the defence will not improbably be set up that\r\nsome animal (_e.g._, a fowl poisoned by cantharides) has been eaten and\r\ncaused the toxic symptoms, for cantharides is an interesting example of\r\na substance which, as before stated, for certain animals (such as\r\nrabbits, dogs, cats, and ducks), is a strong poison, whilst in others\r\n(_e.g._, hedgehogs, fowls, turkeys, and frogs), although absorbed and\r\nexcreted, it appears inert. Experiment has shown that a cat may be\r\nreadily poisoned by a fowl saturated with cantharides; and in Algeria\r\nthe military surgeons meet with cystitis among the soldiers, caused by\r\neating frogs in the months of May and June, the frogs living in these\r\nmonths almost exclusively on a species of cantharides.\r\n\r\nDragendorff recommends the following process:--The finely-pulped\r\nsubstance is boiled in a porcelain dish with potash-lye (1 part of\r\npotash and 12 to 18 of water) until the fluid is of a uniform\r\nconsistence. The fluid, after cooling, is (if necessary) diluted with an\r\nequal bulk of water, for it must not be too thick; then shaken with\r\nchloroform in order to remove impurities; and after separation of the\r\nchloroform, strongly acidified with sulphuric acid, and mixed with about\r\nfour times its volume of alcohol of 90 to 95 per cent. The mixture is\r\nkept for some time at a boiling temperature, filtered hot, and the\r\nalcohol distilled from the filtrate. The watery fluid is now again\r\ntreated with chloroform, as above described. The chloroform extract is\r\nwashed with water, the residue taken up on some hot almond oil, and its\r\nblistering properties investigated. The mass, heated with potash in the\r\nabove way, can also be submitted to dialysis, the diffusate\r\nsupersaturated with sulphuric acid, and shaken up with chloroform.\r\n\r\nIn order to test further for cantharidin, it can be dissolved in the\r\nleast possible potash or soda-lye. The solution, on evaporation in the\r\nwater-bath, leaves crystals of a salt not easily soluble in alcohol, and\r\nthe watery solution of which gives with chloride of calcium and baryta a\r\nwhite precipitate; with sulphate of copper and sulphate of protoxide of\r\nnickel, a green; with cobaltous sulphate, a red; with sugar of lead,\r\nmercury chloride and argentic nitrate, a white crystalline precipitate.\r\nWith palladium chloride there occurs a yellow, hair-like, crystalline\r\nprecipitate; later crystals, which are isomorphous with the nickel and\r\ncopper salts.\r\n\r\nIf the tincture of cantharides has been used in considerable quantity,\r\nthe urine may be examined; in such a case there will collect on the\r\nsurface drops of a green oil, which may be extracted by petroleum ether;\r\nthis oil is not blister-raising. Cantharides in powder may, of course,\r\nbe detected by its appearance.\r\n\r\nTo the question whether the method proposed would extract any other\r\nblister-producing substance, the answer is negative, since ethereal oil\r\nof mustard would be decomposed, and the active constituents of the\r\n_Euphorbias_ do not withstand the treatment with KHO. Oils of anemone\r\nand anemonin are dissolved by KHO, and again separated out of their\r\nsolutions, but their blistering property is destroyed. They are\r\nvolatile, and found in anemone and some of the _Ranunculaceæ_. In the\r\n_Aqua pulsatilla_ there is an oil of anemone, which may be obtained by\r\nshaking with ether; but this oil is not permanent, and if the _Aqua\r\npulsatilla_ stand for a little time, it splits up into anemonic acid and\r\nanemonin, and then cannot be reobtained. A blistering substance,\r\nobtained from the _Anacardia orientalia_ and the fruit of the\r\n_Anacardium occidentale_ and _Semecarpus anacardium_, is not quite\r\ndestroyed by a short action with potash, but is by one of long duration;\r\nthis substance, however, cannot be confused with cantharidin, for it is\r\noily, yellow, easily soluble in alcohol and ether, and differs in other\r\nrespects.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.--Snake Poison.\r\n\r\n§ 639. The poisonous snakes belong chiefly to two classes, the\r\n_Proteroglypha_ and the _Solenoglypha_.\r\n\r\nWeir Mitchell and Ed. T. Reichert[644] have made some important\r\nexperiments on snake poison, using the venom of some 200 snakes. Most of\r\nthe snakes were rattlesnakes, a few were cobras and other species. They\r\ncame to the conclusion that the active constituents are contained in the\r\nfluid part alone, the solid particles suspended in the fluid having no\r\naction. The poison they considered to consist of two toxalbumins, one a\r\nglobulin, acting more particularly on the blood, the other, a peptone\r\n(albumose?), acting more particularly on the tissues. Differences in\r\nsnake venom depend on the relative proportions of these two substances.\r\nThe peptone, which acts more especially locally on the tissues,\r\ndetermines an inflammatory action, with much swelling and multiple\r\nextravasation of blood, which may proceed to a moist gangrene. The\r\nglobulin has a paralysing influence on the heart, the vasomotor centres,\r\nthe peripheral ends of the splanchnic nerves, as well as on the\r\nrespiratory centres of both warm and cold-blooded animals.\r\nFeoktisow’s[645] researches show that although the heart continues to\r\nbeat after the respiration has ceased for a few minutes, it has no\r\nforce. The blood pressure sinks immediately after the injection. Whether\r\nthe globulin is injected subcutaneously or direct into the veins, there\r\nis commonly considerable extravasation of blood in the chest and\r\nabdomen; the intestine is often filled with blood as well as the\r\npericardium; and the urine is bloody. The poison of _Vipera ammodytes_\r\nin watery solution may be boiled for six minutes, and yet is as active\r\nas before. According to Lewin, snake poison generally can be heated to\r\n125° and yet preserve its poisonous properties. These last observations\r\nare not in accordance with the belief of some that the active principle\r\nof snake venom is a ferment, or, indeed, in harmony with the idea that\r\nit is a globulin or toxalbumin; for such bodies have not, so far as we\r\nknow, the stability to withstand so high a degree of heat.\r\n\r\n[644] _Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge_, Washington, 1886.\r\n\r\n[645] _Exp. Unters. über Schlangengift. Inaug. Diss._, Dorpat, 1888.\r\n\r\n§ 640. =The Poison of the Cobra.=--The poison excreted from the salivary\r\nglands of the cobra di capello is the most deadly animal fluid known.\r\nWhen first ejected, it is an amber-coloured, rather syrupy, frothy\r\nliquid, of specific gravity 1·046, and of feeble acid reaction; it dries\r\nrapidly on exposure to air to a yellow film, which readily breaks up\r\ninto brilliant yellow granules, closely imitating crystals. The yellow\r\npowder is very acrid and pungent to the nostrils, and excites a painful\r\n(though transitory) inflammation, if applied to the mucous membrane of\r\nthe eye; the taste is bitter, and it raises little blisters on the\r\ntongue. It is perfectly stable, and preserves its activity for an\r\nindefinite time. The dried poison as described is perfectly soluble in\r\nwater, and if the water is added in proper proportions, the original\r\nfluid is without doubt reproduced, the solution usually depositing a\r\nsediment of epithelial _débris_, and often containing little white\r\nthreads.\r\n\r\nThe poison has been examined by several chemists, but until of late\r\nyears with a negative result. The writer was the first to isolate, in\r\n1876, a crystalline principle, which appears to be the sole acting\r\ningredient; the yellow granules were dissolved in water, the albumen\r\nwhich the venom so copiously contains coagulated by alcohol, and\r\nseparated by filtration; the alcohol was then driven off at a gentle\r\nheat, the liquid concentrated to a small bulk, and precipitated with\r\nbasic acetate of lead. The precipitate was separated, washed, and\r\ndecomposed in the usual way by SH₂, and on removing the lead sulphide,\r\ncrystals having toxic properties were obtained.\r\n\r\nPedler,[646] precipitating the albumen by alcohol, and then to the\r\nalcoholic solution adding platinic chloride, obtained a semi-crystalline\r\nprecipitate, which from an imperfect combustion he thinks may have\r\nsomething like the composition PtCl₄(C₁₇H₂₅N₄O₇HCl)₂. I have examined\r\nthe platinum compound, and made several combustions of different\r\nfractions, but was unable to obtain the compound in a sufficient state\r\nof purity to deduce a formula. My analysis agreed with those of Pedler\r\nfor nitrogen--viz., 9·93 per cent. (Pedler, 9·69); hydrogen 4·17\r\n(Pedler, 4·28); but were higher for carbon, 41·8 per cent. (Pedler,\r\n33·42 per cent.); one fraction gave 7·3 per cent. of platinum, another\r\ndouble that amount. Material was insufficient to thoroughly investigate\r\nthe compound, but it was evident that several double salts were formed.\r\nThe blood of the cobra is also poisonous. A. Calmette[647] has found\r\nthat 2 c.c. of fresh cobra blood, injected into the peritoneum of a\r\nrabbit weighing 1·5 kilo., causes death in six hours; the same dose of\r\nthe defibrinated blood injected into the veins is fatal in three\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\n[646] _Proc. Roy. Soc._, vol. xxvii. p. 17.\r\n\r\n[647] _Compt. Rend., Soc. de Biol._, 1894.\r\n\r\n§ 641. =Fatal Dose.=--From my experiments on cats, rabbits, and birds,\r\nit seems probable that the least fatal dose for cats and rabbits, lies\r\nbetween ·7 and ·9 mgrm. per kilo., and for birds somewhere about ·7\r\nmgrm. per kilo. of the dried poison; the venom contains about 60 per\r\ncent. of albuminous matter, and about 10 per cent. of poisonous\r\nsubstance; therefore, the lethal power is represented by something like\r\n·07 to ·09 mgrm. per kilo., if the pure toxic principle free from\r\nalbumen and diluting impurities be considered.\r\n\r\n§ 642. =Effects on Animals.=--Almost immediately local pain or signs of\r\nuneasiness at the seat of injection are observed. There is then a\r\nvariable interval, seldom exceeding 20 minutes (and generally much\r\nless), but in one of my experiments half an hour elapsed after the\r\ninjection of a fatal dose before any effect was evident. The symptoms\r\nonce produced, the course is rapid, and consists, first, of acceleration\r\nof the respirations, and then a progressive slowing, soon followed by\r\nconvulsions. The convulsions are probably produced by the interference\r\nwith the respiration and the deficient oxidation of the blood, and are\r\ntherefore, the so-called “carbonic acid convulsions.” There is paresis\r\nor paralysis of the limbs. Death seems to occur from asphyxia, and the\r\nheart beats for one or more minutes after the respirations have ceased.\r\nIf the dose is so small as not to produce death, no after-effects have\r\nbeen observed; recovery is complete.\r\n\r\nSir J. Fayrer, and Dr. Lauder Brunton consider that the terminations of\r\nthe motor nerves suffer; on the other hand, Dr. Wall would explain the\r\nphenomena by referring the action entirely to the central nervous\r\nsystem, and concludes that the effects of the cobra poison consist in\r\nthe extinction of function extending from below upwards of the various\r\nnerve centres constituting the cerebro-spinal system. In addition to\r\nthis, there is a special and rapid action on the respiratory and allied\r\nnuclei, and this it is that causes death.\r\n\r\n§ 643. =Effects on Man.=--By far the best account hitherto published of\r\nthe effects of the cobra poison is a paper by Dr. Wall,[648] in which he\r\npoints out the very close similarity between the symptoms produced and\r\nthose of glosso-pharyngeal paralysis. This is well shown in the\r\nfollowing typical case:--A coolie was bitten on the shoulder about\r\ntwelve at midnight by a cobra; he immediately felt burning pain at the\r\nspot bitten, which increased. In fifteen minutes afterwards he began, he\r\nsaid, to feel intoxicated, but he seemed rational, and answered\r\nquestions intelligently. The pupils were natural, and the pulse normal;\r\nthe respirations were also not accelerated. He next began to lose power\r\nover his legs, and staggered. In thirty minutes after the bite his lower\r\njaw began to fall, and frothy viscid mucous saliva ran from his mouth;\r\nhe spoke indistinctly, like a man under the influence of liquor, and the\r\nparalysis of the legs increased. Forty minutes after the bite, he began\r\nto moan and shake his head from side to side, and the pulse and\r\nrespirations were somewhat accelerated; but he was still able to answer\r\nquestions, and seemed conscious. There was no paralysis of the arms. The\r\nbreathing became slower and slower, and at length ceased one hour and\r\nten minutes after the bite, the heart beating for about one minute after\r\nthe respiration had stopped.\r\n\r\n[648] “On the Difference of the Physiological Effects Produced by the\r\nPoison of Indian Venomous Snakes,” by A. T. Wall, M.D., _Proc. Roy.\r\nSoc._, 1881, vol. xxxii. p. 333.\r\n\r\nThere is often very little sign of external injury, merely a scratch or\r\npuncture being apparent, but the areolar tissue lying beneath is of a\r\npurple colour, and infiltrated with a large quantity of coagulable,\r\npurple, blood-like fluid. In addition, the whole of the neighbouring\r\nvessels are intensely injected, the injection gradually diminishing as\r\nthe site of the poisoned part is receded from, so that a bright scarlet\r\nring surrounds a purple area, and this in its turn fades into the normal\r\ncolour of the neighbouring tissues. At the margin is also a purple\r\nblood-like fluid, replaced by a pinkish serum, which may often be traced\r\nup in the tissues surrounding the vessels that convey the poison to the\r\nsystem, and may extend a considerable distance. These appearances are to\r\nbe accounted for in great part by the irritant properties of the cobra\r\nvenom. The local hyperæmia and the local pain are the first symptoms. In\r\nman there follows an interval (which may be so short as a few minutes,\r\nor so long as four hours) before any fresh symptoms appear; the average\r\nduration of the interval is, according to Dr. Wall, about an hour. When\r\nonce the symptoms are developed, then the course is rapid, and, as in\r\nthe case quoted, a feeling like that of intoxication is first produced,\r\nand then loss of power over the legs. This is followed by a loss of\r\npower over the speech, over swallowing, and the movement of the lips;\r\nthe tongue becomes motionless, and hangs out of the mouth; the saliva is\r\nsecreted in large quantities, and runs down the face, the patient being\r\nequally unable to swallow it or to eject it, and the glosso-pharyngeal\r\nparalysis is complete.\r\n\r\n§ 644. =Antidotes and Treatment.=--Professor Halford some years ago\r\nproposed ammonia, and M. Lacerda in recent times has declared potassic\r\npermanganate an antidote to the cobra poison. The ammonia theory has\r\nbeen long disproved, and before Lacerda had made his experiments I had\r\npublished the chemical aspect of some researches,[649] which showed that\r\nmixing the cobra venom with an alkaline solution of potassic\r\npermanganate destroyed its poisonous properties. Other experiments were\r\nalso made in every conceivable way with potassic permanganate, injecting\r\nit separately, yet simultaneously, into different parts of the same\r\nanimal’s body, but so long as it does not come into actual contact with\r\nthe poison it has no antidotal power whatever over the living subject.\r\nOther observers, previous to the researches mentioned and since, all\r\nagree that permanganate is no true antidote.[650] It only acts when it\r\ncomes directly into contact with the venom, but when the venom is once\r\nabsorbed into the circulation potassic permanganate, whether acid,\r\nalkaline, or neutral, is powerless. That it is of great use when applied\r\nto a bite is unquestionable, for it neutralises or changes any of the\r\nvenom hanging about the wound, and which, if allowed to remain, might\r\nyet be absorbed; but here it is obvious that the venom is, so to speak,\r\noutside the body. A. Galmette (_Annales de l’Institut Pasteur_, 25th\r\nMarch 1892) has found that gold chloride forms an insoluble compound\r\nwith the cobra poison, which is not poisonous, and that animal living\r\ntissues impregnated with gold chloride will not absorb the poison. He\r\neven advances some evidence tending to show that gold chloride may\r\novertake, as it were, the venom in the circulation, and thus act as a\r\ntrue antidote. This is improbable, and, until confirmed, the general\r\ntreatment most likely to be successful is the immediate sucking of the\r\nwound, followed by the application of an alkaline solution of\r\npermanganate; and lastly, if the symptoms should nevertheless develop,\r\nan attempt should be made to maintain the breathing by galvanism and\r\nartificial respiration.[651]\r\n\r\n[649] _Analyst_, Feb. 28, 1877.\r\n\r\n[650] See Note on the effect of various substances in destroying the\r\nactivity of the cobra poison. By T. Lauder Brunton and Sir J. Fayrer,\r\n_Proc. Roy. Soc._, vol. xxvii. p. 17.\r\n\r\n[651] Some of my experiments on the cobra poison may be briefly\r\ndetailed, illustrating the general statement in the text:--\r\n\r\n1. A quantity equal to 1 mgrm. of the dried venom was injected\r\nsubcutaneously into a chicken. The symptoms began in two minutes with\r\nloss of power over both legs. In eight minutes the legs were perfectly\r\nparalysed. There were convulsive movements of the head and wings,\r\nslowing of the respiration, and death in ten minutes. The same quantity\r\nof poison was treated with a little tannin, and the clear liquid which\r\nseparated from the precipitate injected into another chicken. The\r\nrespiration became affected in ten minutes; in eighteen minutes the bird\r\nhad become very quiet, and lay insensible; in twenty minutes it was\r\ndead, the respiration ceasing before the heart.\r\n\r\n2. In seven experiments with cobra poison, first rendered feebly\r\nalkaline with an alkaline solution of potassic permanganate, no effect\r\nfollowed. Three of the experiments were on chickens, four on rabbits.\r\n\r\n3. A chicken was injected with 1 mgrm. of cobra poison in one leg, and\r\nin the other simultaneously with a solution of potassic permanganate.\r\nDeath followed in sixteen minutes. Another chicken was treated in the\r\nsame way, but with injections of potassic permanganate solution every\r\nfew minutes. Death resulted in thirty-seven minutes. Four other similar\r\nexperiments were made--two with feebly alkaline permanganate, two with\r\npermanganate made feebly acid with sulphuric acid--but death occurred\r\nwith the usual symptoms.\r\n\r\n4. Cobra poison was mixed with a weak solution of iodine, and a quantity\r\nequal to half a mgrm. was injected into a chicken. The symptoms began\r\ndirectly, were fully developed in ten minutes, and death took place in\r\ntwenty-one minutes.\r\n\r\n5. Equal volumes of cobra venom and aldehyde were mixed, and a quantity\r\nequivalent to 1 mgrm. of the cobra poison injected. The symptoms were\r\nimmediate paralysis and insensibility, and the respiration rapidly fell.\r\nDeath occurred in four minutes without convulsions.\r\n\r\n6. The cobra venom was mixed with a feebly alkaline solution of\r\npyrogallic acid, and injected subcutaneously into a chicken. In six\r\nminutes the usual symptoms commenced, followed in thirteen minutes by\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n7. One mgrm. was injected into a chicken. The respirations at the\r\ncommencement were 120; in twenty-two minutes they sank to 96, in\r\ntwenty-five minutes to 84, in twenty-seven minutes to 18, and then to\r\noccasional gasps, with slight movement of the wings and toes. There was\r\ndeath in thirty-two minutes after the injection.\r\n\r\n8. A young rabbit was injected with ·5 mg. (equal to 1 mgrm. per kilo.)\r\nof cobra poison. In two hours it was apparently moribund, with\r\noccasional short gasps. Artificial respiration was now attempted. There\r\nwas considerable improvement, but it was intermitted during the night,\r\nand the animal was found dead in the morning, having certainly lived six\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n9. A strong healthy kitten was injected with 1 mgrm. of cobra venom\r\n(equal to 5 mgrms. per kilo.). In twenty minutes the symptoms were well\r\ndeveloped, and in an hour the animal was gasping--about twelve short\r\nrespirations per minute. Artificial respiration was kept up for two\r\nhours, and the animal recovered, but there was great muscular weakness\r\nlasting for more than twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n10. A brown rabbit, weighing about 2 kilos., was injected with 12 mgrms.\r\n(6 per kilo.) of the cobra poison. The symptoms developed within ten\r\nminutes; ammonia was injected, and also given by the nostril. The\r\nheart’s action, which, previous to the administration of the ammonia,\r\nhad been beating feebly, became accelerated, but death followed within\r\nthe hour, the heart beating two minutes after the respiration had\r\nceased.\r\n\r\n11. A brown rabbit, about 2 kilos. in weight, was injected with 1·5\r\nmgrms. of cobra poison (·75 per kilo.). There were no symptoms for\r\nnearly an hour, then sudden convulsions, and death.\r\n\r\n12. Another rabbit of the same size was treated similarly, but\r\nimmediately after the injection made to breathe nitrous oxide; death\r\ntook place in thirty minutes. A rabbit, a little over 2 kilos. in\r\nweight, was injected with 7 mgrms. of cobra venom per kilo., and then 10\r\nmgrms. of monobromated camphor were administered. In fifteen minutes\r\nthere was general paralysis of the limbs, from which in a few minutes\r\nthe animal seemed to recover; thirty minutes after the injection there\r\nwere no very evident symptoms, but within forty minutes there was a\r\nsudden accession of convulsions, and death. Experiments were also made\r\nwith chloroform, morphine, and many other substances, but none seemed to\r\nexercise any true antidotal effect.\r\n\r\n§ 645. =Detection of the Cobra Venom.=--In an experiment on a rabbit,\r\nthe animal was killed by the subcutaneous injection of 8 mgrms. per\r\nkilo. of the cobra poison. Immediately after death, 2 c.c. of the blood\r\nwere injected into a small rabbit; in fifteen minutes there was slow\r\nrespiration with pains in the limbs; in thirty minutes this had, in a\r\ngreat measure, passed off, and in a little time the animal was well. In\r\nany case in which it is necessary to attempt to separate the cobra\r\nvenom, the most likely method of succeeding would be to make a cold\r\nalcoholic extract, evaporate in a vacuum, take up the residue in a\r\nlittle water, and test its effect on small animals.\r\n\r\n§ 646. =Duboia Russellii.=--The _Duboia russellii_ or _Russell’s viper_\r\nis one of the best known and most deadly of the Indian vipers. The\r\neffects of the poison of this viper are altogether different from those\r\nof the cobra. The action commences by violent general convulsions, which\r\nare often at once fatal, or may be followed by rapid paralysis and\r\ndeath; or these symptoms, again, may be recovered from, and death follow\r\nat a later period. The convulsions do not depend on asphyxia, and with a\r\nsmall dose may be absent. The paralysis is general, and may precede for\r\nsome time the extinction of the respiration, the pupils are widely\r\ndilated, there are bloody discharges, and the urine is albuminous.\r\nShould the victim survive the first effects, then blood-poisoning may\r\nfollow, and a dangerous illness result, often attended with copious\r\nhæmorrhages. A striking example of this course is recorded in the\r\n_Indian Med. Gaz._, June 1, 1872.\r\n\r\nA Mahommedan, aged 40, was bitten on the finger by Russell’s viper; the\r\nbitten part was soon after excised, and stimulants given. The hand and\r\narm became much swollen, and on the same day he passed blood by the\r\nrectum, and also bloody urine. The next day he was sick, and still\r\npassing blood from all the channels; in this state he remained eight\r\ndays, losing blood constantly, and died on the ninth day. Nothing\r\ndefinite is known of the chemical composition of the poison; it is\r\nprobably qualitatively identical with “viperin.”\r\n\r\n§ 647. =The Poison of the Common Viper.=--The common viper still abounds\r\nin certain parts of Great Britain, as, for example, on Dartmoor. The\r\nvenom was analysed in a partial manner by Valentin. In 1843 Prince\r\nLucien Bonaparte separated a gummy varnish, inodorous, glittering, and\r\ntransparent, which he called _echidnin_ or _viperin_; it was a neutral\r\nnitrogenous body without taste, it arrested the coagulation of the\r\nblood, and, injected into animals, produced all the effects of the bite\r\nof the viper. Phisalix and G. Bertrand have studied the symptoms\r\nproduced in small animals after injection. A guinea-pig, weighing 500\r\ngrms., was killed by 0·3 grm. of the dried venom dissolved in 5000 parts\r\nof saline water; the symptoms were nausea, quickly passing into stupor.\r\nThe temperature of the body fell. The autopsy showed the left auricle\r\nfull of blood, the intestine, lungs, liver, and kidneys injected. The\r\nblood of the viper is also poisonous, and produces the same symptoms as\r\nthe venom.[652] The same observers have shown (_Compt. rend._, cxviii.,\r\nJan. 1894) that the blood of the water-snake (_Tropidonotus natrix_) and\r\nof the Thuringian adder (_Tropidonotus viperinus_) is poisonous,\r\nproducing the same symptoms as that of the viper.\r\n\r\n[652] _Compt. rend. Soc. de Biol._, t. v. 997.\r\n\r\n=The Venom of Naja Haje= (=Cleopatra’s Asp=).--It has been stated that\r\n20,000 persons annually die in Ceylon from the bite of Cleopatra’s asp.\r\nGraziani (_Rif. Med._, October 7, 1893) has undertaken a physiological\r\nstudy of the venom, which has already received attention at the hands of\r\nCalmette, Wall and Armstrong, Weir Mitchell, Reichardt, and others. The\r\nvenom, when dried, appears as transparent scales, easily soluble in\r\nwater, very slightly so in alcohol, ether, or chloroform; its aqueous\r\nsolution has an unpleasant odour, and is neutral to test paper.\r\nChemically it gives all the tests described by Weir Mitchell and others\r\nas characteristic of the venom of _Naja tripudians_. The physiological\r\neffects of this dried venom were tried on guinea-pigs, rabbits, and\r\nfrogs, to all of which it proved fatal in extremely minute doses. The\r\nguinea-pig, a few seconds after injection, becomes paralysed in its hind\r\nlimbs, it foams at the mouth, and makes violent attempts at vomiting.\r\nThe eyes are half closed, but occasionally for short periods there is a\r\npartial disappearance of the paralysis, and the animal makes feeble\r\nattempts to support itself. Respiratory embarrassment is soon added to\r\nthe foregoing symptoms, and the animal lies perfectly prone, devoting\r\nall its attention to breathing, which is rendered still more difficult\r\nby the vomiting and frothy saliva which is secreted in abundance.\r\nFinally death ensues from asphyxia. The _post-mortem_ examination\r\nreveals the heart still feebly beating, the lungs pallid, and the blood\r\nin the organs very dark. The liver and kidneys are hyperæmic, but the\r\nbrain and cord, with their coverings, are anæmic. In the rabbit the\r\ncourse of the poisoning is practically identical with that described\r\nabove. Histologically, the following facts are made out in addition to\r\nthe foregoing. The red blood-corpuscles are in great measure broken\r\ndown, and there are also effusions into the muscular tissues. The\r\nkidneys are very hyperæmic, and there is marked degeneration of the\r\nepithelium lining the glomeruli and convoluted tubules. The glomerular\r\ncapsules are much distended, and numerous leucocytes are discernible\r\nthroughout the organ. The liver, also, is hyperæmic, and shows numerous\r\nbroken-down blood-corpuscles, and partial necrosis of many of the liver\r\ncells. Examination of the central nervous system reveals no particular\r\nchanges.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIVISION II.--PTOMAINES--TOXINES.\r\n\r\n§ 648. =Definition of a Ptomaine.=--A ptomaine may be considered as a\r\nbasic chemical substance derived from the action of bacteria on\r\nnitrogenous substances. If this definition is accepted, a ptomaine is\r\nnot necessarily formed in the dead animal tissue; it may be produced by\r\nthe living, and, in all cases, it is the product of bacterial life. A\r\nptomaine is not necessarily poisonous; many are known which are, in\r\nmoderate doses, quite innocuous.\r\n\r\nWhen Selmi’s researches were first published there was some anxiety lest\r\nthe existence of ptomaines would seriously interfere with the detection\r\nof poison generally, because some were said to be like strychnine,\r\nothers like colchicine, and so forth. Farther research has conclusively\r\nshown that at present no ptomaine is known which so closely resembles a\r\nvegetable poison as to be likely in skilled hands to cause confusion.\r\n\r\n\r\nIsolation of Ptomaines.\r\n\r\n§ 649. =Gautier’s[653] Process.=--The liquid is acidified with oxalic\r\nacid, warmed, filtered, and distilled in a vacuum.\r\n\r\n[653] _Ptomaines et Leucomaines_, E. J. A. Gautier, Paris, 1886.\r\n\r\nIn this way pyrrol, skatol, phenol, indol, and volatile fatty acids are\r\nseparated and will be found in the distillate. The residue in the retort\r\nis treated with lime, filtered from the precipitate that forms, and\r\ndistilled in a vacuum, the distillate being received in weak sulphuric\r\nacid. The bases accompanied with ammonia distil over. The distillate is\r\nnow neutralised by sulphuric acid[654] and evaporated nearly to dryness,\r\nseparating the mother liquid from sulphate of ammonia, which\r\ncrystallises out. The mother liquids are treated with absolute alcohol,\r\nwhich dissolves the sulphates of the ptomaines. The alcohol is got rid\r\nof by evaporation, the residue treated with caustic soda, and the bases\r\nshaken out by successive treatment with ether, petroleum ether, and\r\nchloroform. The residue remaining in the retort with the excess of lime\r\nis dried, powdered, and exhausted with ether; the ethereal extract is\r\nseparated, evaporated to dryness, the dry residue taken up in a little\r\nwater, slightly acidulated, and the bases precipitated by an alkali.\r\n\r\n[654] The first acid apparently is so dilute that the distillate more\r\nthan neutralises it, hence more sulphuric acid is added to complete\r\nneutralisation.\r\n\r\n§ 650. =Brieger’s Process.=--Brieger[655] thus describes his process:--\r\n\r\n[655] _Untersuchungen über Ptomaine_, Theil iii., Berlin, 1886.\r\n\r\n“The matters are finely divided and boiled with water feebly acidulated\r\nwith hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\n“Care must be taken that on boiling, the weak acid reaction must be\r\nretained, and that this manipulation only lasts a few minutes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n“The insoluble portion is filtered off, and the filtrate evaporated,\r\neither in the gas-oven or on the water-bath, to syrupy consistency. If\r\nthe substances are offensive, as alcoholic and watery extracts of flesh\r\nusually are, the use of Bocklisch’s simple apparatus (see diagram) is to\r\nbe recommended. The filtrate to be evaporated is placed in a flask\r\nprovided with a doubly perforated caoutchouc cork carrying two bent\r\ntubes; the tube _b_ terminates near the bottom of the flask, while the\r\ntube _a_ terminates a little above the level of the fluid to be\r\nevaporated. The tube _a_ is connected with a water pump which sucks away\r\nthe escaping steam. In order to avoid the running back of the condensed\r\nwater forming in the cooler part of the tube, the end of the tube _a_ is\r\ntwisted into a circular form. Through the tube _b_, which has a fine\r\ncapillary bore, a stream of air is allowed to enter, which keeps the\r\nfluid in constant agitation, continually destroying the scum on the\r\nsurface, and avoiding sediments collecting at the bottom, which may\r\ncause fracture of the flask. According to the regulation of the air\r\ncurrent, a greater or smaller vacuum can be produced. The fluid,\r\nevaporated to the consistency of a syrup, is treated with 96 per cent.\r\nalcohol, filtered, and the filtrate precipitated with lead acetate.\r\n\r\n“The lead precipitate is filtered off, the filtrate evaporated to a\r\nsyrup, and the syrup again treated with 96 per cent. alcohol. This is\r\nagain filtered, the alcohol got rid of by evaporation, water added, the\r\nlead thrown down by SH₂, and the fluid, after the addition of a little\r\nhydrochloric acid, evaporated to the consistence of a syrup; this syrup\r\nis exhausted with 96 per cent. alcohol, and precipitated with an\r\nalcoholic solution of mercury chloride. The mercury precipitate is\r\nboiled with water, and by the different solubility of the mercury salts\r\nof certain ptomaines some separation takes place. If it is suspected\r\nthat some of the ptomaines may have been separated with the lead\r\nprecipitate, this lead precipitate can be decomposed by SH₂ and\r\ninvestigated. I have only (says Brieger) in the case of mussels been\r\nable to extract from the lead precipitate small quantities of ptomaines.\r\n\r\n“The mercury filtrate is freed from mercury and evaporated, the excess\r\nof hydrochloric acid being carefully neutralised by means of soda (for\r\nit must only be slightly acid); then it is again treated with alcohol,\r\nso as to separate as much as possible the inorganic constituents. The\r\nalcoholic extract is evaporated, dissolved in a little water,\r\nneutralised with soda, acidulated with nitric acid, and precipitated\r\nwith phospho-molybdic acid. The phospho-molybdic acid precipitate is\r\ndecomposed with neutral lead acetate, which process may be facilitated\r\nby heating on the water-bath. After getting rid of the lead by treatment\r\nwith SH₂, the fluid is evaporated to a syrup and alcohol added, by which\r\nprocess many ptomaines may be eliminated as hydrochlorates; or they can\r\nbe converted into double salts (of platinum or gold) for the purpose of\r\nseparation. In the filtrate from phospho-molybdate, ptomaines may also\r\nbe found by treating with lead acetate to get rid of the\r\nphospho-molybdic acid, and then adding certain reactives. Since it is\r\nbut seldom that the hydrochlorates are obtained in a state of purity, it\r\nis preferable to convert the substance separated into a gold or platinum\r\nsalt or a picrate, since the greater or less solubility of these\r\ncompounds facilitates the purification of individual members; but which\r\nreagent is best to add, must be learned from experience. The\r\nmelting-point of these salts must always be taken, so that an idea of\r\ntheir purity may be obtained. It is also to be noted that many gold\r\nsalts decompose on warming the aqueous solution; this may be avoided by\r\nthe addition of hydrochloric acid. The hydrochlorates of the ptomaines\r\nare obtained by decomposing the mercury, gold, or platinum combinations\r\nby the aid of SH₂, while the picrates can be treated with hydrochloric\r\nacid and shaken up with ether, which latter solvent dissolves the picric\r\nacid.\r\n\r\n“Considerable difficulty in the purification of the ptomaines is caused\r\nby a nitrogenous, amorphous, non-poisonous, albumin-like substance,\r\nwhich passes into all solutions, and can only be got rid of by careful\r\nprecipitation with an alcoholic solution of lead acetate, in which it is\r\nsoluble in excess. This albuminoid forms an amorphous compound with\r\nplatinum, and acts as a strongly reducing agent (the platinum compound\r\ncontains 29 per cent. platinum). When this albuminoid is eliminated,\r\nthen the hydrochlorates or the double salts of the ptomaines\r\ncrystallise.”\r\n\r\n§ 651. =The Benzoyl Chloride Method.=--The fatty diamines in dilute\r\naqueous solutions, shaken with benzoyl chloride and soda, are converted\r\ninto insoluble dibenzoyl derivatives; these may be separated from\r\nbenzamide and other nitrogenous products by dissolving the precipitate\r\nin alcohol, and pouring the solution into a large quantity of\r\nwater.[656] Compounds which contain two amido groups combined with one\r\nand the same carbon atom, do not yield benzoyl derivatives when shaken\r\nwith benzoyl chloride and soda. Hence this reaction can be utilised for\r\ncertain of the ptomaines only. The solution must be dilute, because\r\nconcentrated solutions of creatine, creatinine, and similar bodies also\r\ngive precipitates with benzoyl chloride; no separation, however, occurs\r\nunless these bodies are in the proportion of five per thousand.\r\n\r\n[656] L. V. Udrànsky and Baumann, _Ber._, xxi. 2744.\r\n\r\nThe process is specially applicable for the separation of\r\nethylenediamine, pentamethylenediamine (cadaverine), and\r\ntetramethylenediamine (putrescine) from urine. In a case of\r\ncystinuria Udrànsky and E. Baumann[657] have found 0·24 grm. of\r\nbenzoyltetramethylenediamine, 0·42 grm. of benzoylpentamethylenediamine\r\nin a day. Diamines are absent in normal fæces and urine. Stadthagen and\r\nBrieger[658] have also found, in a case of cystinuria diamines, chiefly\r\npentamethylenediamine.\r\n\r\n[657] L. V. Udrànsky and Baumann, _Zeit. f. physiol. Chem._, xiii. 562.\r\n\r\n[658] _Arch. pathol. Anatom._, cxv. p. 3.\r\n\r\nThe operation is performed by making the liquid alkaline with soda, so\r\nthat the alkalinity is equal to about 10 per cent., adding benzoyl\r\nchloride, shaking until the odour of benzoyl chloride disappears, and\r\nthen filtering; to the filtrate more benzoyl chloride is added, the\r\nliquid shaken, and, if a precipitate appears, this is also filtered off,\r\nand the process repeated until all diamines are separated.\r\n\r\nThe precipitate thus obtained is dissolved in alcohol, and the alcoholic\r\nsolution poured into a considerable volume of water and allowed to stand\r\nover night; the dibenzoyl compound is then usually found to be in a\r\ncrystalline condition. The compound is crystallised once or twice from\r\nalcohol or ether, and its melting-point and properties studied. Mixtures\r\nof diamines may be separated by their different solubilities in ether\r\nand alcohol.\r\n\r\nA solution of 0·00788 grm. of pentamethylenediamine in 100 c.c. of water\r\ngave 0·0218 grm. of the dibenzoyl-derivative when shaken with benzoyl\r\nchloride (5 c.c.) and 40 c.c. of soda (10 per cent.) and kept for\r\ntwenty-four hours. In a second experiment with a similar solution only\r\n0·0142 grm. of dibenzoyl-derivative was obtained;[659] hence the process\r\nis not a good quantitative process, and, although convenient for\r\nisolation, gives, so far as the total amount recovered is concerned,\r\nvarying results.\r\n\r\n[659] _Ber._, xxi. 2744.\r\n\r\n§ 652. =The Amines.=--The amines are bases originating from ammonia and\r\nbuilt on the same type. Those that are interesting as poisons are\r\nmonamines, diamines, and the quaternary ammonium bases.\r\n\r\nConsidered as compound ammonias, the amines are divided into primary or\r\namide bases, secondary or imid bases, and tertiary or nitrile bases,\r\naccording as to whether one, two, or three atoms of hydrogen have been\r\ndisplaced from the ammonia molecule by an alkyl; for instance,\r\nmethylamine NH₂CH₃ is a primary or amide base, because only one of the\r\nthree atoms of H in NH₃ has been replaced by methyl; similarly,\r\ndimethylamine is a secondary or imid base, and trimethylamine is a\r\ntertiary or nitrile base.\r\n\r\nThe quaternary bases are derived from the hypothetical ammonium\r\nhydroxide NH₄OH, as, for example, tetraethyl ammonium hydroxide\r\n(C₂H₅)₄N,OH.\r\n\r\nThe diamines are derived from two molecules of NH, and therefore\r\ncontain, instead of one molecule of nitrogen, two molecules of nitrogen;\r\nin two molecules of ammonia there are six atoms of hydrogen, two, four,\r\nor six of which may be replaced by alkyls; as, for example,\r\n\r\n    C₂H₄\r\n    /  \\\r\n   /    \\\r\n  N--HH--N\r\n   \\    /\r\n    \\  /\r\n     HH\r\n\r\n  Ethylenediamine.\r\n\r\n     C₂H₄\r\n    /   \\\r\n   /     \\\r\n  N--C₂H₄--N\r\n   \\     /\r\n    \\   /\r\n     HH\r\n\r\n  Diethylenediamine.\r\n\r\n     C₂H₄\r\n    /   \\\r\n   /     \\\r\n  N--C₂H₄--N\r\n   \\     /\r\n    \\   /\r\n     C₂H₄\r\n\r\n  Triethylenediamine.\r\n\r\nThe monamines are similar to ammonia in their reactions; some of them\r\nare stronger bases; for instance, ethylamine expels ammonia from its\r\nsalts. The first members of the series are combustible gases of pungent\r\nodour, and easily soluble in water; the higher homologues are fluids;\r\nand the still higher members solids.\r\n\r\nThe hydrochlorides are soluble in absolute alcohol, while chloride of\r\nammonium is insoluble; this property is taken advantage of for\r\nseparating amines from ammonia. The amines form double salts with\r\nplatinic chloride; this is also utilised for recognition, for the\r\npurpose of separation, and for purification; for instance,\r\nammonium-platinum-chloride on ignition yields 43·99 per cent. of\r\nplatinum, and methylamine-platinum-chloride yields 47·4 of platinum. It\r\nis comparatively easy to ascertain whether an amine is primary,\r\nsecondary, or tertiary.\r\n\r\nThe primary and secondary amines react with nitrous acid, but not the\r\ntertiary; the primary amines, for instance, are converted into alcohols,\r\nand there is an evolution of nitrogen gas; thus methylamine is\r\ndecomposed into methyl alcohol, nitrogen, and water.\r\n\r\n  CH₃NH₂ + (OH)NO = CH₃(OH) + N₂ + H₂O.\r\n\r\nThe secondary amines, treated in the same way, evolve no nitrogen, but\r\nare converted into nitrosamines; thus dimethylamine, when treated with\r\nnitrous acid, yields nitrosodimethylamine,\r\n\r\n  (CH₃)₂NH + (OH)NO = (CH₃)₂(NO)N + H₂O;\r\n\r\nand the nitrosamines respond to the test known as Lieberman’s\r\nnitroso-reaction, which is thus performed:--The substance is dissolved\r\nin phenol and a few drops of concentrated sulphuric acid added. The\r\nyellow colour at first produced changes into blue by adding to the acid\r\nliquid a solution of potash.\r\n\r\nThe primary amines, and the primary amines alone, treated with\r\nchloroform and alcoholic potash, yield the peculiarly offensive smelling\r\ncarbylamine or isonitrile (Hofmann’s test),\r\n\r\n                             V\r\n  NH₂(CH₃) + CHCl₃ + 3KOH = C≣N-CH₃ + 3KCl + 3H₂O.\r\n\r\nAgain the primary bases, when treated with corrosive sublimate and\r\ncarbon disulphide, evolve sulphuretted hydrogen, and mustard oil is\r\nproduced, _e.g._,\r\n\r\n   NH₂(C₂H₅)   + CS₂ =  CS=N-C₂H₅   + H₂S.\r\n  Ethylamine.        Ethylmustard\r\n                         oil.\r\n\r\nWhere a sufficient quantity of an amine is obtained, the primary,\r\nsecondary, or tertiary character of the amine may be deduced with\r\ncertainty by treating it with methyl or ethyl iodide.\r\n\r\nA molecule of the base is digested with a molecule of methyl iodide and\r\ndistilled with potash; the distillate is in the same manner again\r\ntreated with methyl iodide and again distilled; and the process is\r\nrepeated until an ammonium base is obtained, which will take up no more\r\niodide. If three methyl groups were in this way introduced, the original\r\nsubstance was primary, if two, secondary, if one, tertiary.\r\n\r\nThe quaternary bases, such as tetraethyl ammoniumoxhydrate, decompose,\r\non heating, into triethylamine and ethylene; the corresponding methyl\r\ncompound in like manner yields trimethylamine and methyl-alcohol.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the primary, secondary, and tertiary bases do not\r\ndecompose on heating, but volatilise without decomposition.\r\n\r\nThe chief distinctions between these various amines are conveniently put\r\ninto a tabular form as follows:--\r\n\r\n  +--------------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+\r\n  |                    |  Primary, |Secondary, | Tertiary, |Quaternary,|\r\n  |                    |   NH₂R.   |   NHR₂.   |    NR₃.   |  NR₄(OH). |\r\n  +--------------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+\r\n  |On treating with    |      3    |     2     |     1     |   ...     |\r\n  |methyl iodide it    |           |           |           |           |\r\n  |takes up the follow-|           |           |           |           |\r\n  |ing number of methyl|           |           |           |           |\r\n  |groups,             |           |           |           |           |\r\n  |                    |           |           |           |           |\r\n  |Reaction with       |Decomposes |Formation  |           |           |\r\n  |nitrous acid,       |with evolu-|of nitro-  |   ...     |   ...     |\r\n  |                    |tion of    |samine.    |           |           |\r\n  |                    |nitrogen   |           |           |           |\r\n  |                    |gas.       |           |           |           |\r\n  |                    |           |           |           |           |\r\n  |Mustard oil, &c., on|Mustard oil|           |           |           |\r\n  |treatment with CS₂  |formed.    |   ...     |   ...     |   ...     |\r\n  |and sublimate,      |           |           |           |           |\r\n  |                    |           |           |           |           |\r\n  |Chloroform and      |Formation  |   ...     |   ...     |   ...     |\r\n  |alcoholic potash,   |of carbyl- |           |           |           |\r\n  |                    |amine.     |           |           |           |\r\n  |                    |           |           |           |           |\r\n  |Effect of strong    |Sublimes.  |Sublimes.  |Sublimes.  |Decomposes.|\r\n  |heat,               |           |           |           |           |\r\n  |                    |           |           |           |           |\r\n  |On addition of      |Combines to|Combines to|Combines to|   ...     |\r\n  |acids,              |form salts.|form salts.|form salts.|           |\r\n  +--------------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+\r\n\r\n    § 653. =Methylamine,= CH₃NH₂.--This is a gas at ordinary\r\n    temperatures; it is inflammable, and possesses a strong ammoniacal\r\n    odour. It has been found in herring brine, and is present in\r\n    cultures of the comma bacillus; it has also been found in poisonous\r\n    sausages, but it is not in itself toxic.\r\n\r\n    It forms crystalline salts, such as, for example, the hydrochloride,\r\n    the platinochloride (Pt = 41·4 per cent.), and the aurochloride (Au\r\n    = 53·3 per cent. when anhydrous). The best salt for estimation is\r\n    the platinochloride, insoluble in absolute alcohol and ether.\r\n\r\n    § 654. =Dimethylamine=, (CH₃)₂NH.--Dimethylamine is also a gas; it\r\n    has been found in various putrefying substances. It forms\r\n    crystalline salts, such as the hydrochloride, the platinochloride\r\n    (Pt = 39·1 per cent.), and an aurochloride (Au = 51·35 per cent.).\r\n    It is not poisonous.\r\n\r\n    In Brieger’s process it may occur in both the mercuric chloride\r\n    precipitate and filtrate. From cadaverine it may be separated by\r\n    platinum chloride; cadaverine platinochloride is with difficulty\r\n    soluble in cold water and crystallises from hot water, while\r\n    dimethylamine remains in the mother liquor. From choline it may be\r\n    separated by recrystallising the mercuric precipitate from hot\r\n    water. From methylamine it may be separated by converting into\r\n    chloride and extracting with chloroform; dimethylamine chloride is\r\n    soluble, methylamine chloride insoluble in chloroform.\r\n\r\n    § 655. =Trimethylamine=, (CH₃)₃N.--Trimethylamine in the free state\r\n    is an alkaline liquid with a fishy odour, boiling at 9·3°; it is not\r\n    toxic save in large doses.\r\n\r\n    It occurs in a great variety of plants, and is also found in\r\n    putrefying substances. It is a product of the decomposition of\r\n    choline, betaine, and neuridine, when these substances are distilled\r\n    with potash.\r\n\r\n    In Brieger’s process, if an aqueous solution of mercuric chloride is\r\n    used as the precipitant, trimethylamine (if present) will be almost\r\n    entirely in the filtrate, from which it can be obtained by getting\r\n    rid of the mercury by SH₂, filtering, evaporating to dryness,\r\n    extracting with alcohol, and precipitating the alcoholic solution\r\n    with platinic chloride. It forms crystalline salts with hydrochloric\r\n    acid, platinum chloride, and gold chloride; the platinum double salt\r\n    yields 37 per cent. of platinum, the gold salt 49·4 per cent. gold.\r\n    The gold salt is easily soluble, and this property permits its\r\n    separation from choline, which forms a compound with gold chloride\r\n    soluble with difficulty.\r\n\r\n    § 656. =Ethylamine=, C₂H₅NH₂.--Ethylamine is in the free state an\r\n    ammoniacal liquid boiling at 18·7°. It is a strong base, miscible\r\n    with water in every proportion. It has been found in putrefying\r\n    yeast, in wheat flour, and in the distillation of beet sugar\r\n    residues. It is not poisonous; the hydrochloride forms deliquescent\r\n    plates melting at 76°-80°; the platinochloride contains 39·1 per\r\n    cent. of platinum, and the gold salt 51·35 per cent. of gold. In\r\n    other words, the same percentages as the corresponding salts of\r\n    dimethylamine, with which, however, it cannot be confused.\r\n\r\n    § 657. =Diethylamine=, (C₂H₅)₂NH, is an inflammable liquid boiling\r\n    at 57·5°; it forms salts with hydrochloric acid, platinum and gold,\r\n    &c.; the gold salt contains 47·71 per cent. of gold, and its\r\n    melting-point is about 165°.\r\n\r\n    § 658. =Triethylamine=, (C₂H₅)₃N, is an oily base but slightly\r\n    soluble in water, and boiling at 89°-89·5°. It gives no precipitate\r\n    with mercuric chloride in aqueous solution; it forms a\r\n    platinochloride containing 31·8 per cent. of platinum. It has been\r\n    found in putrid fish.\r\n\r\n    § 659. =Propylamine.=--There are two propylamines; one, normal\r\n    propylamine, CH₃CH₂.CH₂.NH₂, boiling at 47°-48°, and\r\n    iso-propylamine, (CH₃)₂CH.NH₂, boiling at 31·5°; both are ammoniacal\r\n    fish-like smelling liquids. The hydrochloride of normal propylamine\r\n    melts at 155°-158°, and iso-propylamine chloride melts at 139·5°.\r\n\r\n    It has been found in cultures of human fæces on gelatin. None of the\r\n    above amines are sufficiently active in properties to be poisonous\r\n    in the small quantities they are likely to be produced in\r\n    decomposing foods.\r\n\r\n    § 660. =Iso-amylamine=, (CH₃)₂CH.CH₂.CH₂.NH₂, is a colourless\r\n    alkaline liquid, possessing a peculiar odour. It boils at 97°-98°.\r\n    It forms a deliquescent hydrochloride. The platinochloride\r\n    crystallises in golden yellow plates.\r\n\r\n    Iso-amylamine occurs in the putrefaction of yeast, and is a normal\r\n    constituent of cod-liver oil. It is intensely poisonous, producing\r\n    convulsions.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiamines.\r\n\r\n§ 661. =Rate of Formation of Diamines.=--Diamines are formed in\r\nputrefactive processes, generally where there is abundance of nitrogen.\r\nGarcia[660] has attempted to trace the rates at which they are formed by\r\nallowing meat extracts to decompose, precipitating by benzoyl chloride\r\n(see p. 487) the dibenzoyl compound, and weighing; the following were\r\nthe results obtained:--\r\n\r\n[660] _Zeit. f. physiol. Chemie_, xvii. 6. 571.\r\n\r\n    Time.

From the alcoholic solution platinum chloride precipitated\r\n    neuridine, this was filtered off, the filtrate freed from alcohol\r\n    and platinum, and the aqueous solution concentrated to a small\r\n    volume and precipitated with an aqueous solution of platinum\r\n    chloride; this precipitated ethylidene platinum chloride. The mother\r\n    liquor from this precipitate was concentrated on the water-bath,\r\n    and, on cooling, the platinochloride of muscarine crystallised out.\r\n    From the mother liquor (freed from the crystals), on standing in a\r\n    desiccator, the gadinine double salt crystallised out, and from the\r\n    mother liquor (freed from gadinine after removal of the platinum by\r\n    SH₂) distillation with KHO recovered trimethylamine.\r\n\r\n    From the platinochloride of ethylenediamine, the chloride can be\r\n    obtained by treating with SH₂, filtering, and evaporating; by\r\n    distilling the chloride with a caustic alkali, the free base can be\r\n    obtained by distillation.\r\n\r\n    Ethylidenediamine is isomeric with ethylenediamine, but differs from\r\n    it in the following properties:--ethylidenediamine is poisonous,\r\n    ethylenediamine is non-poisonous.\r\n\r\n    Ethylenediamine forms a platinochloride almost insoluble in hot\r\n    water, while the ethylidene salt is more easily soluble. The\r\n    properties of the gold salts are similar, ethylenediamine forming a\r\n    difficultly soluble gold salt, ethylidene a rather soluble gold\r\n    salt.\r\n\r\n    Ethylidenediamine forms a hydrochloride, C₂H₈N₂2HCl, crystallising\r\n    in long glistening needles, insoluble in absolute alcohol, rather\r\n    soluble in water. The hydrochloride gives precipitates in aqueous\r\n    solution with phospho-molybdic acid, phospho-antimonic acid, and\r\n    potassium bismuth iodide; the latter is in the form of red plates.\r\n\r\n    The platinochloride, C₂H₈N₂2HCl.PtCl (Pt = 41·5 per cent.), is in\r\n    the form of yellow plates, not very soluble in cold water.\r\n\r\nEthylidenediamine, when subcutaneously injected into guinea-pigs,\r\nproduces an abundant secretion from the mucous membranes of the nose,\r\nmouth, and eyes. The pupils dilate, and the eyeballs project. There is\r\nacute dyspnœa; death takes place after some twenty-four hours, and the\r\nheart is stopped in diastole.\r\n\r\nTrimethylenediamine is believed to have been isolated by Brieger from\r\ncultivations in beef broth of the comma bacillus.\r\n\r\nIt occurs in small quantity in the mercuric chloride precipitate, and is\r\nisolated by decomposing the precipitate with SH₂, evaporating the\r\nfiltrate from the mercury sulphide to dryness, taking up the residue\r\nwith absolute alcohol, and precipitating by an alcoholic solution of\r\nsodium picrate. The precipitate contains the picrate of\r\ntrimethylenediamine, mixed with the picrates of cadaverine and\r\ncreatinine. Cadaverine picrate is insoluble in boiling absolute alcohol,\r\nthe other picrates soluble; so the mixed picrates are boiled with\r\nabsolute alcohol, and the insoluble cadaverine filtered off. Next, the\r\npicrates of creatinine and trimethylenediamine are freed from alcohol,\r\nthe solution in water acidified with hydrochloric acid, the picric acid\r\nshaken out by treatment with ether, and then the solution precipitated\r\nwith platinum chloride; the platinochloride of trimethylenediamine is\r\nnot very soluble, while creatinine easily dissolves; so that separation\r\nis by this means fairly easy.\r\n\r\nIt also gives a difficultly soluble salt with gold chloride.\r\n\r\nThe picrate consists of felted needles, melting-point 198°.\r\nPhospho-molybdic acid gives a precipitate crystallising in plates;\r\npotassium bismuth iodide gives dark coloured needles.\r\n\r\nIt produces in animals violent convulsions and muscular tremors; but the\r\nsubstance has hitherto been obtained in too small a quantity to be\r\ncertain as to its identification and properties.\r\n\r\n§ 663. =Neuridine=, C₅H₁₄N₂.--Neuridine is a diamine, and is apparently\r\nthe most common basic product of putrefaction; it has been obtained from\r\nthe putrefaction of gelatin, of horseflesh, of fish, and from the yelk\r\nof eggs. It is usually accompanied by choline, from which it can be\r\nseparated by converting the bases into hydrochlorides, choline\r\nhydrochloride being soluble in absolute alcohol, neuridine scarcely so.\r\nBrieger isolated neuridine from putrid flesh by precipitating the watery\r\nextract with mercuric chloride. He decomposed the mercury precipitate\r\nwith SH₂, and, after having got rid of the sulphide of mercury by\r\nfiltration, he concentrated the liquid to a small bulk, when a substance\r\nseparated in crystals similar in form to urea; this was purified by\r\nrecrystallisation from absolute alcohol, and converted into the platinum\r\nsalt.\r\n\r\nAnother method which may be used for the separation and purification of\r\nneuridine is to dissolve it in alcohol and precipitate with an alcoholic\r\nsolution of picric acid; the picrate may be decomposed by treatment with\r\ndilute mineral acid, and the picric acid removed by shaking with ether.\r\n\r\nThe free base has a strong seminal odour. It is gelatinous, and has not\r\nbeen crystallised. It is insoluble in ether and in absolute alcohol, and\r\nnot readily soluble in amyl alcohol. It gives white precipitates with\r\nmercuric chloride, neutral and basic lead acetates. It does not give\r\nHofmann’s isonitrile reaction. When distilled with a fixed alkali, it\r\nyields di- and trimethylamine.\r\n\r\nThe hydrochloride, C₅H₁₄N₂2HCl, crystallises in long needles, which are\r\ninsoluble in absolute alcohol, ether, benzol, chloroform, petroleum\r\nether, and amyl alcohol; but the hydrochloride is very soluble in water\r\nand in dilute alcohol.\r\n\r\nThe hydrochloride gives no precipitate with mercuric chloride,\r\npotass-mercuric iodide, potass-cadmium iodide, iodine and iodide of\r\npotassium, tannic acid, ferricyanide of potassium, ferric chloride, and\r\nit does not give any colour with Fröhde’s reagent.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, phosphotungstic acid, phospho-molybdic acid, picric\r\nacid, potass-bismuth iodide, platinum chloride, and gold chloride all\r\ngive precipitates.\r\n\r\nNeuridine hydrochloride is capable of sublimation, and at the same time\r\nit is decomposed, for the sublimed needles show red or blue colours.\r\n\r\nNeuridine platinochloride, C₅H₁₄N₂2HCl.PtCl₄, yields 38·14 per cent. of\r\nplatinum; it crystallises in flat needles, soluble in water, from which\r\nit is precipitated on the addition of alcohol.\r\n\r\nThe aurochloride has the formula C₅H₁₄N₂2HCl2AuCl₃; it is rather\r\ninsoluble in cold water, and crystallises in bunches of yellow needles.\r\nOn ignition, it should yield 41·19 per cent. of gold.\r\n\r\nThe picrate, C₅H₁₄N₂,2C₆H₂(NO₂)₃OH, is almost insoluble in cold water,\r\nand crystallises in needles. It is not fusible, but decomposes at about\r\n230°.\r\n\r\nNeuridine is not poisonous.\r\n\r\n§ 664. =Cadaverine= (Pentamethylenediamine, C₅H₁₄N₂ =\r\nNH₂CH₂--CH₂--CH₂--CH₂CH₂NH₂) is formed in putrid animal matters, and in\r\ncultures of the genus _Vibrio_. It has been found in the urine and fæces\r\nin cases of cystinuria, and Roos[661] has separated it by the\r\nbenzoyl-chloride method from the fæces of a patient suffering from\r\ntertian ague. It may be formed synthetically by dissolving\r\ntrimethylcyanide in absolute alcohol, and then reducing by sodium\r\n(Mendius’ reaction).\r\n\r\n[661] _Zeit. f. physiol. Chemie_, xvi., 1892.\r\n\r\nCadaverine is a thick, clear, syrupy liquid, with a peculiar coniine- as\r\nwell as a semen-like odour. It absorbs eagerly CO₂ from the air, and\r\nultimately is converted into a solid crystalline mass. It volatilises\r\nwith the steam when boiled with water, and may be distilled in the\r\npresence even of the caustic alkalies and the alkaline earths without\r\ndecomposition. It does not give oil of mustard when treated with CS₂ and\r\nmercuric chloride, nor does it give with chloroform and alcoholic\r\npotash, carbylamine (isonitrile). If dehydrated by KHO, it boils at from\r\n115°-120° (_Brieger_).[662]\r\n\r\n[662] Brieger has also given to the pure base a boiling-point of 175°.\r\n\r\nWhen cadaverine is treated with methyl iodide, two atoms of hydrogen may\r\nbe replaced with methyl, forming the base C₅H₁₂(CH₃)₂N₂; the\r\nplatinochloride of this last base crystallises in long red needles.\r\n\r\nCadaverine forms well-defined crystalline salts as well as compounds\r\nwith metals.\r\n\r\nCadaverine hydrochloride, C₅H₁₄N₂2HCl, crystallises in needles which are\r\ndeliquescent, or it may be obtained from an alcoholic solution in\r\nplates. The crystals are insoluble in absolute alcohol, but readily\r\nsoluble in 96 per cent. alcohol. Putrescine hydrochloride, on the other\r\nhand, is with difficulty soluble in alcohol of that strength; hence the\r\ntwo hydrochlorides can be separated by taking advantage of their\r\ndifference in solubility in 96 per cent. alcohol; but the better\r\nmethod for separation is the benzoyl-chloride process (p. 487). On\r\ndry distillation, cadaverine hydrochloride decomposes into\r\nNH₃,HCl and piperidine C₅H₁₁N. The compound with mercury\r\nchloride--C₅H₁₄N₂2HCl,4HgCl₂ (Hg = 63·54 per cent.); melting-point,\r\n214°-216°--is insoluble in alcohol and in cold water; this property is\r\nalso useful to separate it from putrescine, the mercury compound of\r\nwhich is soluble in cold water. The platinochloride, C₅H₁₄N₂2HCl,PtCl₄\r\n(Pt = 38·08 per cent.), crystallises in dirty red needles; but, by\r\nrepeated crystallisation, it may be obtained in clear chrome yellow,\r\nshort, octahedral prisms; it is soluble with difficulty in hot water,\r\ninsoluble in cold water. The salt decomposes at 235°-236°.\r\n\r\nThe aurochloride--C₅H₁₄N₂2HCl2AuCl (Au = 50·41 per cent.), melting-point\r\n188°--crystallises partly in cubes and partly in needles, and is easily\r\nsoluble in water.\r\n\r\nOther salts are the picrate, C₅H₁₄N₂2C₆H₂(NO₂)₃OH, melting-point 221°\r\nwith decomposition; with difficulty soluble in cold, but dissolving in\r\nhot water, and insoluble in absolute alcohol. There are also a neutral\r\noxalate, C₅H₁₄N₂,H₂C₂O₄ + 2H₂O, melting-point 160°; and an acid oxalate,\r\nC₅H₁₄N₂2H₂C₂O₄ + H₂O, melting-point 143° with decomposition; both these\r\noxalates are insoluble in absolute alcohol.\r\n\r\nCadaverine dibenzoyl--C₅H₁₀(NHCOC₆H₅)₂, melting-point\r\n129°-130°--crystallises in needles and plates, soluble in alcohol and\r\nslightly soluble in ether, insoluble in water.\r\n\r\nIt is not acted on by hot dilute acids or alkalis, and when dissolved in\r\nconcentrated hydrochloric acid and alcohol it is, only after prolonged\r\nboiling, decomposed into benzoic acid and the free base. The benzoic\r\nacid after getting rid of the alcohol by evaporation, can be removed by\r\nshaking up with ether; then the hydrochloride can be decomposed by an\r\nalkali and the free base obtained, or the platinum salt of cadaverine\r\nmay be formed by precipitation with platinum chloride. Should cadaverine\r\nand putrescine be in the same liquid, the dibenzoyl compounds may be\r\nseparated as follows:--the crystalline precipitate is collected on a\r\nfilter, washed with water until the filtrate runs clear, and then\r\ndissolved in warm alcohol; this solution is poured into twenty times its\r\nvolume of ether and allowed to stand; after a short time crystals form\r\nof the putrescine compound, which are far less soluble in alcohol than\r\nthose of cadaverine dibenzoyl; these crystals are filtered off and\r\nrepeatedly crystallised from alcohol until the melting-point is about\r\n175°-176°. The filtrate contains the cadaverine compound; this latter is\r\nrecovered by evaporating off the ether-alcohol.\r\n\r\n§ 665. =Putrescine--Tetramethylenediamine=,\r\n\r\n  C₄H₁₂N₂=NH₂CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₂NH₂.\r\n\r\nThe free base is a clear liquid, with a semen-like odour, boiling-point\r\n135°. It is a common base in putrefying animal substances, and also\r\noccurs in the urine in cases of cystinuria. It can be obtained\r\nsynthetically by reducing ethylene cyanide by the action of sodium in\r\nabsolute alcohol.\r\n\r\nThe best method of separating putrescine is the benzoyl chloride method\r\nalready given.\r\n\r\nPutrescine forms crystalline salts, of which the following are the most\r\nimportant:--\r\n\r\nPutrescine hydrochloride, C₄H₁₂N₂2HCl, forms long colourless needles,\r\ninsoluble in absolute alcohol, easily soluble in water.\r\n\r\nThe platinochloride, C₄H₁₂N₂2HCl.PtCl₄ (Pt = 39·2 per cent.), is with\r\ndifficulty soluble in cold water. When pure, the salt is in the form of\r\nsix-sided plates.\r\n\r\nThe aurochloride, C₄H₁₂N₂2HCl.2AuCl₃ + 2H₂O (Au = 51·3 per cent.), is\r\ninsoluble in cold water, in contradistinction to cadaverine\r\naurochloride, which easily dissolves.\r\n\r\nThe picrate, C₄H₁₂N₂2C₆H₂(NO₂)₃OH, is a salt of difficult solubility. It\r\ncrystallises in yellow plates. It browns at 230°, and melts with\r\nevolution of gas at 250°.\r\n\r\nDibenzoylputrescine, C₄H₈(NHCOC₆H₅)₂, forms silky plates or long\r\nneedles, melting-point 175°-176°. By boiling it for twelve hours with\r\nalcohol and strong hydrochloric acid the compound may be broken up into\r\nhydrochloride of putrescine and free benzoic acid. As stated before, it\r\nis less soluble in alcohol than the corresponding compound of\r\ncadaverine.\r\n\r\nPutrescine is not poisonous. On the other hand, by repeated treatment\r\nwith methyl iodide, it takes up four methyl radicals, and the\r\ntetramethyl compound, C₄H₈(CH₃)₄N₂, produces symptoms similar to those\r\nof muscarine poisoning.\r\n\r\n§ 666. =Metaphenylenediamine=,\r\n\r\n      NH₂¹\r\n     /\r\n  C₆H₄    ,\r\n     \\\r\n      NH₂³\r\n\r\nis a crystalline substance, melting-point 63°, boiling-point 276°-277°.\r\nThe crystals are easily soluble in alcohol or ether, with difficulty in\r\nwater. The least trace of nitrous acid strikes a yellow colour from the\r\nformation of triamidobenzol.\r\n\r\n§ 667. =Paraphenylenediamine=,\r\n\r\n      NH₂¹\r\n     /\r\n  C₆H₄    ,\r\n     \\\r\n      NH₂⁴\r\n\r\nis in the form of tabular crystals, melting-point 140°, boiling-point\r\n267°. If this substance is oxidised with ferric chloride or manganese\r\nbinoxide and sulphuric acid, chinone is produced; if treated with SH₂\r\nand ferric chloride, a violet sulphur-holding colouring matter, allied\r\nto methylene blue, is formed; these reactions are tests for the presence\r\nof the para-compound.\r\n\r\nBoth these diamines are poisonous. Metaphenylenediamine produces, in the\r\ndog, the symptoms of an aggravated influenza with continual sneezing and\r\nhoarse cough, which, if the dose is large enough, ends in coma and\r\ndeath. Paraphenylenediamine produces exophthalmia, the tissues of the\r\neye undergoing complete alteration.[663]\r\n\r\n[663] _Comptes Rend._, cvii. 533-535.\r\n\r\nBoth compounds, in doses of 100 mgrms. per kilo., cause more or less\r\nsalivation, with diarrhœa. The para-compound is more poisonous than the\r\nmeta-compound. So far as the author is aware, neither of these diamines\r\nhave been separated with certainty from the urine of sick persons, nor\r\nfrom products of decomposition.\r\n\r\n§ 668. =Hexamethylenediamine=, C₆H₁₆N₂.--Hexamethylenediamine has been\r\nfound by A. Garcia[664] in a putrefying mixture of horse-flesh and\r\npancreas.\r\n\r\n[664] _Zeit. f. physiol. Chemie_, xvii. 543-555.\r\n\r\n§ 669. =Diethylenediamine=, C₄H₁₀N₂, is a crystalline substance,\r\nmelting-point 104°, boiling-point 145°-146°. After melting, it\r\nsolidifies on cooling, forming a hard crystalline mass. It is extremely\r\nsoluble in water, and is deposited from alcohol in large transparent\r\ncrystals. A technical product called “spermin piperazidin” or\r\n“piperazine” has been found by A. W. v. Hoffmann[665] to be identical\r\nwith diethylenediamine. The hydrochloride crystallises in colourless\r\nneedles, insoluble in alcohol, readily soluble in water. The\r\nplatinochloride, C₄H₁₀N₂H₂PtCl₆, is in small yellow needles, and is\r\nfairly easily soluble in hot water, but dissolves but slightly in hot\r\nalcohol. The mercuro-chloride, C₄H₁₀N₂H₂HgCl₄, crystallises in\r\nconcentrically grouped needles, and is readily soluble in hot water, but\r\nis reprecipitated on adding alcohol. The picrate, C₄H₁₀N₂,C₆H₂(NO₂)₃OH,\r\ncrystallises from water in yellow needles, almost insoluble in\r\nalcohol.[666]\r\n\r\n[665] _Ber._, xxiii. 3297-3303.\r\n\r\n[666] Sieber, J., _Ber._, xxiii. 326-327.\r\n\r\n§ 670. =Mydaleine= is a poisonous base discovered by Brieger in putrid\r\nanimal matters. It is probably a diamine, but has not been obtained in\r\nsufficient quantity for accurate chemical study. The platinochloride is\r\nextremely soluble in water, and only comes down from an absolute alcohol\r\nsolution. It has been obtained in a crystalline form, giving on analysis\r\n38·74 per cent. of platinum, C. 10·83 per cent., H. 3·23 per cent.\r\n\r\nMydaleine is very poisonous. Small quantities injected into guinea-pigs\r\ncause dilatation of the pupil, an abundant secretion from the nose and\r\neyes, and a rise of temperature. Fifty mgrms. cause death. The\r\n_post-mortem_ appearances are not distinctive; the heart is arrested in\r\ndiastole; the intestines and bladder are contracted. In cats it causes\r\nprofuse diarrhœa and vomiting.\r\n\r\n§ 671. =Guanidine.=--Guanidine may be considered to have a relation to\r\nurea; for, if the oxygen of urea is replaced by the imide group NH,\r\nguanidine originates thus:--\r\n\r\n             NH₂\r\n            /\r\n  Urea = O=C\r\n            \\\r\n             NH₂\r\n\r\n                  NH₂\r\n                 /\r\n  Guanidine = NHC\r\n                 \\\r\n                  NH₂\r\n\r\nHence guanidine from its structural formula is a carbodiamidimide.\r\nGuanidine may be formed by the action of oxidising agents, such as\r\npotassic chlorate and hydrochloric acid, on guanine; or by heating amide\r\ncyanide with ammonium chloride, and so forming guanidine chloride. It is\r\nalso produced from the oxidation of albumin. When boiled with\r\nbaryta-water it decomposes into urea and ammonia. It combines with acids\r\nto form salts; the gold salt, CH₅N₃HCl,AuCl₃, is in the form of long\r\nyellow needles, with difficulty soluble in water. Guanidine nitrate,\r\nCH₅N₃HNO₃, is also almost insoluble in cold water and similar to urea\r\nnitrate. By dissolving equivalent parts of phenol and guanidine in hot\r\nalcohol, triphenylguanidine is formed; on adding picric acid to a\r\nsolution of triphenylguanidine, phenylguanidine picrate,\r\nCH₂Ph₃N₃C₆H₂(NO₂)₃OH, is formed, and falls as a precipitate of slender\r\nneedles, melting-point 208°; this picrate is very slightly soluble, 1\r\npart dissolving in 12,220 parts of water at 15°. Guanidine is\r\npoisonous.[667]\r\n\r\n[667] O. Prelinger, _Monatsb._, xiii. 97-100.\r\n\r\nA method of separating guanidine from urine has been worked out by\r\nGergers and Baumann.[668] The principle of the method is based upon the\r\nfact that guanidine is precipitated by mercurous oxide. The urine is\r\nprecipitated by hydrate of baryta, the precipitate filtered off, the\r\nalkaline filtrate neutralised by hydrochloric acid, and the neutral\r\nfiltrate evaporated to a syrup on the water-bath; the syrup is exhausted\r\nby absolute alcohol, and the alcoholic solution filtered; this filtrate\r\nis freed from alcohol by distillation, the alcohol-free residue\r\ndissolved in a little water, shaken up with freshly precipitated mercury\r\noxide, and allowed to stand for two days in a warm place; the\r\nprecipitate formed is collected, acidulated with HCl and treated with\r\nSH₂; the mercury sulphide thus obtained is separated by filtration, the\r\nfiltrate evaporated, and the residue dissolved in absolute alcohol. This\r\nsolution is precipitated by platinum chloride, filtered, separated from\r\nany platinum ammonium salt, and evaporated to a small volume. After long\r\nstanding the guanidine salt crystallises out. The best method to\r\nidentify it appears to be, to ascertain the absence of ammonia and of\r\nurea, and then to gently warm the supposed guanidine with an alkali,\r\nwhich breaks guanidine up into ammonia and urea, according to the\r\nfollowing equation:--\r\n\r\n  NH=C(NH₂)₂ + H₂O = NH₃ + CO(NH₂)₂.\r\n\r\n[668] Pflüger’s _Archiv_, xii. 205.\r\n\r\nThe physiological effects of guanidine are as follows:--\r\n\r\nA centigrm. of guanidine salt injected into the lymph sac in the back of\r\nfrogs produces, after a few minutes, muscular convulsions: first, there\r\nare fibrillar twitchings of the muscles of the back; next, these spread\r\ngenerally so that the whole surface of the frog seems to be in a\r\nwave-like motion. Irritation of the limbs produces tetanus. There is, at\r\nthe same time, increased secretion from the skin. The breathing is\r\nirregular. In large doses there is paralysis and death. The heart is\r\nfound arrested in diastole. The fatal dose for a frog is 50 mgrms.; but\r\n1 mgrm. will produce symptoms of illness. In dogs there is paralysis,\r\nconvulsions, vomiting, and difficult breathing.\r\n\r\n§ 672. =Methylguanidine=,\r\n\r\n       NH.CH₃\r\n      /\r\n  NH=C      .\r\n      \\\r\n       NH₂\r\n\r\n--Methylguanidine has been isolated by Brieger from putrefying\r\nhorse-flesh; it has also been found in impure cultures in beef broth of\r\nFinkler and Prior’s _Vibrio proteus_. Bocklisch isolated it, working\r\nwith Brieger’s process, from the mercuric chloride precipitate, after\r\nremoval of the mercury and concentration of the filtrate, by adding a\r\nsolution of sodium picrate. The precipitate contained the picrates of\r\ncadaverine, creatinine, and methylguanidine; cadaverine picrate,\r\ninsoluble in boiling absolute alcohol, was separated by filtering from a\r\nsolution of the picrates of the bases in boiling absolute alcohol; the\r\nalcohol was evaporated from the filtrate and the residue taken up with\r\nwater. From this aqueous solution the picric acid was removed and then\r\nthe solution precipitated with gold chloride; methylguanidine was\r\nprecipitated, while creatinine remained in solution.\r\n\r\nMethylguanidine aurochloride, C₂H₇N₃HCl.AuCl₃ (Au = 47·7 per cent.),\r\nforms rhombic crystals easily soluble in alcohol and ether;\r\nmelting-point 198°. The hydrochloride, C₂H₇N₃HCl, crystallises in\r\nneedles insoluble in alcohol. The picrate, C₂H₇N₃C₆H₂(NO₂)₃OH, comes\r\ndown at first as a resinous mass, but, after boiling in water, is found\r\nto be in the form of needles soluble in hot absolute alcohol;\r\nmelting-point 192°. The symptoms produced by methylguanidine are rapid\r\nrespiration, dilatation of the pupils, paralysis, and death, preceded by\r\nconvulsions. The heart is found arrested in diastole.\r\n\r\n§ 673. =Saprine=, C₅H₁₄N₂.--Saprine is isomeric with cadaverine and\r\nneuridine; it was found by Brieger in human livers and spleens after\r\nthree weeks’ putrefaction. Saprine occurs, in Brieger’s process, in the\r\nmercury precipitate. Its reactions are very similar to those of\r\ncadaverine; the main difference being that cadaverine hydrochloride\r\ngives a crystalline aurochloride, saprine does not; the platinum salt is\r\nalso more soluble in water than the cadaverine salt. It is not\r\npoisonous.\r\n\r\n§ 674. =The Choline Group.=--The choline group consists of choline,\r\nneurine, betaine, and muscarine.\r\n\r\nAll these bodies can be prepared from choline; their relationship to\r\ncholine can be readily gathered from the following structural formulæ:--\r\n\r\n  CH₂OH\r\n  |\r\n  CH₂\r\n  |\r\n  N(CH₃)₃.OH\r\n\r\n  Choline.\r\n\r\n  CH₂\r\n  ║\r\n  CH\r\n  |\r\n  N(CH₃)₃.OH\r\n\r\n  Neurine.\r\n\r\n  CO₂H\r\n  |\r\n  CH₂\r\n  |\r\n  N(CH₃)₃.OH\r\n\r\n  Betaine.\r\n\r\n  CH₂OH\r\n  |\r\n  CHOH\r\n  |\r\n  N(CH₃)₃.OH\r\n\r\n  Muscarine.\r\n\r\nCholine is a syrup with an alkaline reaction. On boiling with water, it\r\ndecomposes into glycol and trimethylamine. It gives, when oxidised,\r\nmuscarine. It forms salts. The hydrochloride is soluble in water and\r\nabsolute alcohol; neurine hydrochloride and betaine hydrochloride are\r\nbut little soluble in absolute alcohol, therefore this property can be\r\nutilised for their separation from choline. The platinochloride is\r\ninsoluble in absolute alcohol; it melts at 225° with effervescence, and\r\ncontains 31·6 per cent. of platinum. The mercurochloride is soluble with\r\ndifficulty even in hot water. The aurochloride (Au = 44·5 per cent.) is\r\ncrystalline, and with difficulty soluble in cold water; but is soluble\r\nin hot water and in alcohol; melting-point 264° with decomposition.\r\n\r\nCholine is only poisonous in large doses.\r\n\r\n§ 675. =Neurine= (Trimethyl-vinyl-ammonium hydrate),\r\nC₂H₃N(CH₃)₃OH.--Neurine is one of the products of decomposition of\r\ncholine. It is poisonous, and has been separated by Brieger and others\r\nfrom decomposing animal matters. In Brieger’s process, neurine, if\r\npresent, will be for the most part in the mercuric chloride precipitate,\r\nand some portion will also be in the filtrate. The mercury precipitate\r\nis decomposed by SH₂, the mercury sulphide filtered off, and the\r\nfiltrate, concentrated, treated with absolute alcohol and then\r\nprecipitated by platinum chloride. It is usually accompanied by choline;\r\nthe platinochloride of choline is readily soluble in water, neurine\r\nplatinochloride is soluble with difficulty; this property is taken\r\nadvantage of, and the platinochloride crystallised from water until\r\npure. Neurine has a strong alkaline reaction.\r\n\r\nNeurine chloride, C₅H₁₂N.Cl, crystallises in fine needles. The\r\nplatinochloride, (C₅H₁₂NCl)₂PtCl₄ (Pt = 33·6 per cent.), crystallises in\r\noctahedra. The salt is soluble with difficulty in hot water.\r\n\r\nThe aurochloride, C₅H₁₂NClAuCl₃ (Au = 46·37 per cent.), forms flat\r\nprisms, which, according to Brieger, are soluble with difficulty in hot\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nNeurine is intensely poisonous, the symptoms being similar to those\r\nproduced by muscarine.\r\n\r\nAtropine is an antidote to neurine, relieving in suitable doses the\r\neffects, and even rendering animals temporarily immune against the toxic\r\naction of neurine.\r\n\r\nWhen a fatal dose of neurine is injected into a frog there is in a short\r\ntime paralysis of the extremities. The respiration stops first, and\r\nafterwards the heart, the latter in diastole.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms in rabbits are profuse nasal secretion and salivation with\r\nparalysis, as in frogs. Applied to the eye, neurine causes contraction\r\nof the pupil; to a less degree the same effect is produced by the\r\ningestion of neurine.\r\n\r\n=Trimethyloxyammonium= hydrochloride causes similar symptoms to neurine,\r\nbut the action is less powerful.--V. Cervello, _Arch. Ital. Biol._, vii.\r\n232-233.\r\n\r\n§ 676. =Betaine.=--Betaine may be separated from a solution in alcohol\r\nas large deliquescent crystals; the reaction of the crystals is neutral.\r\nDistilled with potash, trimethylamine and other bases are formed.\r\n\r\nBetaine chloride, C₅H₁₂NO₂Cl, forms plates permanent in the air and\r\ninsoluble in absolute alcohol. A solution of the chloride in water\r\ngives, with potassium mercuric iodide, a light yellow or whitish yellow\r\nprecipitate, soluble in excess; but, on rubbing the sides of the tube\r\nwith a glass rod, the oily precipitate crystallises as yellow needles;\r\nprobably this is characteristic.\r\n\r\nThe aurochloride (Au = 43·1 percent.) forms fine cholesterine plates,\r\nsoluble in water; melting-point 209°. Betaine is not poisonous.\r\n\r\n§ 677. =Peptotoxine.=--Brieger submitted to the action of fresh gastric\r\njuice moist fibrin for twenty-four hours at blood heat. The liquid was\r\nevaporated to a syrup and boiled with ethylic alcohol, the ethylic\r\nalcohol was evaporated, the residue digested with amylic alcohol, and\r\nthe amyl alcohol in its turn evaporated to dryness; the residue was a\r\nbrown amorphous mass that was poisonous. It was farther purified by\r\ntreating the extract with neutral lead acetate and then filtered; the\r\nfiltrate was freed from lead by SH₂ and treated with ether, the ethereal\r\nextract being then separated and evaporated to dryness; this last\r\nresidue was taken up with amyl alcohol, the alcohol evaporated to\r\ndryness, and the residue finally taken up with water and filtered. The\r\nfiltrate is poisonous. The poisonous substance, to which Brieger gave\r\nthe provisional name of peptotoxine, is a very stable substance,\r\nresisting the action of a boiling temperature, and even the action of\r\nstrong alkalies. It gives precipitates with alkaloidal group reagents,\r\nand strikes a blue colour with ferric chloride and ferricyanide of\r\npotassium. The most characteristic test seems to be its action with\r\nMillon’s reagent (a solution of mercury nitrate in nitric acid\r\ncontaining nitrous acid); this gives a white precipitate which, on\r\nboiling, becomes intensely red.\r\n\r\nIt is poisonous, killing rabbits in doses of 0·5 grm. per kilogrm., with\r\nsymptoms of paralysis and coma. The nature of this substance requires\r\nfurther elucidation.\r\n\r\n§ 678. =Pyridine Alkaloid from the Cuttle Fish.=--O. de Coninck[669] has\r\nobtained, by Gautier’s process, an alkaloid from the cuttle fish, of the\r\nformula C₈H₁₁N, in the form of a yellow, mobile, strongly odorous\r\nliquid, very soluble in alcohol, ether, and acetone, boiling-point 202°.\r\nIt quickly absorbs moisture from the air. It forms two mercuric\r\nchlorides, one of which has the formula (C₈H₁₁N,HCl)₂HgCl₂; this\r\ncompound crystallises in small white needles, slightly soluble in water\r\nand dilute alcohol, but insoluble in absolute alcohol, and decomposing\r\nwhen exposed to moist air. The other salt is a sesqui-salt, forming long\r\nyellowish needles, insoluble in ordinary solvents, and decomposing when\r\nexposed to moist air. The alkaloid also forms deliquescent very soluble\r\nsalts with hydrochloric and hydrobromic acids. A platinum salt is also\r\nformed, (C₈H₁₁N)₂H₂PtCl₆; it is of a deep yellow colour, almost\r\ninsoluble in cold, but soluble in hot water; it is decomposed by boiling\r\nwater, with the formation of a very insoluble compound in the shape of a\r\nbrown powder, (C₈H₁₁N)₂PtCl₄. Coninck’s alkaloid, on oxidation with\r\npotassic permanganate, yields a gummy acid; this acid, on purifying it\r\nby conversion into a potassium salt and then into a cupric salt, was\r\nfound to be nicotinic acid; so that the alkaloid is undoubtedly a\r\npyridine compound; indeed, the acid, distilled with lime, yields\r\npyridine.\r\n\r\n[669] _Comptes Rend._, cvi. 858, 861; cviii. 58-59, 809-810; cvi.\r\n1604-1605.\r\n\r\n§ 679. =Poisons connected with Tetanus.=--Brieger, in 1887, isolated a\r\nbase of unknown composition, to which he gave the name of\r\n“spasmotoxine.” It was produced in cultures of the tetanus bacillus in\r\nbeef broth.\r\n\r\nTwo more definite substances have also been discovered, viz., tetanine\r\nand tetanotoxine.\r\n\r\n=Tetanine=, C₁₃H₃₀N₂O₄, is best isolated by the method of Kitasato and\r\nWeyl.[670] Their method of treating broth cultures of the tetanus\r\nbacillus is as follows:--\r\n\r\n[670] _Zeit. f. Hygiene_, viii. 404.\r\n\r\nThe broth is digested with 0·25 per cent. HCl for some hours at 460°,\r\nthen rendered feebly alkaline, and distilled in a vacuum. The residue in\r\nthe retort is then worked up for tetanine by Brieger’s method; the\r\ndistillate contains tetanotoxine, ammonia, indol, hydrogen sulphide,\r\nphenol, and butyric acid. On treating the contents of the retort by\r\nBrieger’s mercury chloride method, the filtrate contains most of the\r\npoison. The mercury is removed by SH₂, the filtered solution evaporated\r\nand exhausted by absolute alcohol, in which the tetanine dissolves. Any\r\nammonium chloride is thus separated, ammonium chloride being insoluble\r\nin absolute alcohol. The alcoholic solution, filtered from any insoluble\r\nsubstance, is next treated with an alcoholic solution of platinum\r\nchloride, which precipitates creatinine (and any ammonium salts), but\r\ndoes not precipitate tetanine. The platinum salt of tetanine may,\r\nhowever, be precipitated by the addition of ether to the alcoholic\r\nsolution. The platinum salt, as obtained by precipitation from ether, is\r\nvery deliquescent; it has, therefore, to be rapidly filtered off and\r\ndried in a vacuum. It can then be recrystallised from hot 96 per cent.\r\nalcohol, forming clear yellow plates; these plates, if dried in a\r\nvacuum, become with difficulty soluble in water.\r\n\r\nTetanine may be obtained as a free base by treating the hydrochloride\r\nwith freshly precipitated moist silver oxide. It forms a strongly\r\nalkaline yellow syrup, and is easily decomposed in acid solution, but is\r\npermanent in alkaline solutions.\r\n\r\nThe platinochloride, as before observed, is precipitable by ether from\r\nalcoholic solution; it contains 28·3 per cent. of platinum, and\r\ndecomposes at 197°.\r\n\r\nThe base produces tetanus.\r\n\r\n§ 680. =Tetanotoxine= may be distilled, and be found in the distillate\r\nwith other matters. It forms an easily soluble gold salt, melting-point\r\n130°. The platinochloride is soluble with difficulty, and decomposes at\r\n240°. The hydrochloride is soluble in alcohol and in water,\r\nmelting-point about 205°.\r\n\r\nTetanotoxine produces tremor, then paralysis, and lastly, violent\r\nconvulsions.\r\n\r\n§ 681. =Mydatoxine=, C₆H₁₃NO₂.--A base obtained by Brieger from\r\nhorse-flesh in a putrefactive condition and other substances. It is\r\nfound in the mercury chloride precipitate. The free base is an alkaline\r\nsyrup, isomeric with the base separated by Brieger from tetanus\r\ncultures. The hydrochloride is a deliquescent syrup, not forming any\r\ncompound with gold chloride, but uniting with phospho-molybdic acid in\r\nforming a compound crystallising in cubes. It forms a double salt with\r\ngold chloride, sparingly soluble in water. The platinochloride (Pt = 29\r\nper cent.) is very soluble in water, but not soluble in alcohol;\r\nmelting-point 193° with decomposition.\r\n\r\nThe base in large doses is poisonous, causing lachrymation, diarrhœa,\r\nand convulsions.\r\n\r\n§ 682. =Mytilotoxine=, C₆H₁₅NO₂.--This is believed to be the poison of\r\nmussels. Brieger isolated it as follows:--\r\n\r\nThe mussels were boiled with water acidified by hydrochloric acid; the\r\nliquid was filtered, and the filtrate evaporated to a syrup, and the\r\nsyrup was repeatedly extracted with alcohol. It was found advisable to\r\nexhaust thoroughly with alcohol, otherwise much poison remained behind.\r\nThe alcoholic solution was treated with an alcoholic solution of lead\r\nacetate. The filtrate was evaporated and the residue extracted with\r\nalcohol. The lead was removed by SH₂, the alcohol distilled off, water\r\nadded to the remaining syrup, and the solution decolorised by boiling\r\nwith animal charcoal. The solution was neutralised by sodium carbonate,\r\nacidulated with nitric acid, and precipitated with phosphomolybdic acid.\r\nThe precipitate was then decomposed by warming with a neutral solution\r\nof lead acetate, and the filtrate (after the removal of the lead by the\r\naction of SH₂) was acidulated with HCl and evaporated to dryness. The\r\nresidue was then extracted with absolute alcohol, filtered from any\r\ninsoluble chloride, _e.g._, betaine chloride, and precipitated by\r\nmercury chloride in alcohol.\r\n\r\nThe free base has a most peculiar odour, which disappears on exposure to\r\nair; at the same time, the poisonous properties also diminish. The base\r\nis destroyed by boiling with sodium carbonate; on the other hand, the\r\nhydrochloride may be evaporated to dryness or be boiled without\r\ndecomposing.\r\n\r\nThe hydrochloride crystallises in tetrahedra; the aurochloride\r\ncrystallises in cubes (Au=41·66 per cent.). Its melting-point is 182°.\r\n\r\n§ 683. =Tyrotoxicon= (Diazobenzol, C₆H₅N₂(OH)).--It appears, from the\r\nresearches of Vaughan and others, that diazobenzol is liable to be\r\nformed in milk and milk products, especially in summer time. It is\r\nconfidently asserted by many that the summer diarrhœa of infants is due\r\nto this toxine; however that may be, it is well established that\r\ndiazobenzol is a violent poison, causing sickness, diarrhœa, and, in\r\nlarge doses, an acute malady scarcely distinguishable from cholera, and\r\nwhich may end fatally. There will always be difficulty in detecting it,\r\nbecause of its instability. The following is the best process of\r\nextraction from milk. The milk will probably be acid from decomposition;\r\nif so, the whey must be separated by dilution and filtration; without\r\ndilution it may be found impracticable to get a clear filtrate. In order\r\nto keep the bulk down, 25 c.c. of the milk may be diluted up to 100\r\nc.c., and, having obtained a clear filtrate from this 25 c.c. thus\r\ndiluted, the filtrate is used to dilute another 25 c.c. of milk and so\r\non. The acid filtrate is neutralised by sodium carbonate, agitated with\r\nan equal volume of ether, allowed to stand in a stoppered vessel for\r\ntwenty-four hours, and the ether then separated and allowed to evaporate\r\nspontaneously. The residue is acidified with nitric acid and then\r\ntreated with a saturated solution of potash, which forms a stable\r\ncompound with diazobenzol, and the whole concentrated on the water-bath.\r\nOn cooling, the tyrotoxicon compound forms six-sided plates. Before the\r\nwhole of this process is undertaken, it is well to make a preliminary\r\ntest of the milk as follows:--A little of the ether is allowed to\r\nevaporate spontaneously. Place on a porcelain slab two or three drops of\r\na mixture of equal parts of sulphuric and carbolic acids, and add a few\r\ndrops of the aqueous solution; if tyrotoxicon be present, a yellow to\r\norange-red colour is produced. A similar colour is also produced by\r\nnitrates or nitrites, which are not likely to be present under the\r\ncircumstances, milk having mere traces only of nitrates or nitrites; it\r\nmay also be due to butyric acid, which, in a decomposed milk, may\r\nfrequently be in solution. Therefore, if a colour occurs, this is not\r\nabsolutely conclusive; if, however, no colour is produced, then it is\r\ncertain that no diazobenzol has been separated. That is all that can be\r\nsaid, for the process itself is faulty, and only separates a fractional\r\npart of the whole.\r\n\r\n§ 684. =Toxines of Hog Cholera.=--Toxines have been isolated by F. G.\r\nNovy[671] from a cultivation of Salmon’s bacillus in pork broth. The\r\nfluid possessed a strong alkaline reaction. For the isolation, Brieger’s\r\nmethod was used. The mercury chloride precipitate was amorphous and was\r\nconverted into a chlorine-free platinum compound, to which was assigned\r\nthe composition of C₈H₁₄N₄PtO₈. After separation of this compound, the\r\nmother liquor still contained a platinum salt crystallising in needles,\r\nand from this was obtained the chlorhydrate of a new base, to which was\r\ngiven the name of _susotoxine_; it had the composition of\r\nC₁₀H₂₆N₂2HCl,PtCl₄. Susotoxine gives general alkaloidal reactions, and\r\nis very poisonous.\r\n\r\n[671] _Med. News_, September 1890.\r\n\r\n§ 685. =Other Ptomaines.=--Besides the ptomaines which have been already\r\ndescribed, there are a number of others; the following may be mentioned:\r\nisoamylamine,[672] (CH₃)₂CH.CH₂.CH₂NH₂; butylamine, CH₃CH₂CH₂CH₂NH₂;\r\ndihydrolutidine,[673] C₇H₁₁N; hydrocollidine,[674] C₈H₁₃N; C₁₀H₁₅N (a\r\nbase isolated by Guareschi and Mosso[675] from ox-fibrin in a state of\r\nputrefaction by Gautier’s method; it forms a crystalline hydrochloride\r\nand an insoluble platinochloride; its action is like that of curare but\r\nweaker); aselline,[676] C₂₅H₃₂N₄, isolated from cod-liver oil;\r\ntyphotoxine,[677] C₇H₁₇NO₂, isolated from cultures of Eberth’s bacillus.\r\nSo far as the published researches go, it would appear that other\r\ncrystalline substances have been isolated from the urine, from the\r\ntissues, and from the secretions of patients suffering from various\r\ndiseases; the quantity obtained in each case has, however, been, under\r\nthe most favourable circumstances, less than a gramme; often only a few\r\nmilligrms. To specifically declare that a few milligrms. of a substance\r\nis a new body, requires immense experience and great skill; and, even\r\nwhere those qualifications are present, this is too often impossible.\r\nThis being so, the long list of named ptomaines, such as erysipeline,\r\nvarioline, and others, must have their existence more fully confirmed by\r\nmore than one observer before they can be accepted as separate entities.\r\n\r\n[672] Hesse, _Chem.

A large number of cases of poisoning by food occur yearly; some\r\nare detailed in the daily press; the great majority are neither recorded\r\nin any journal, scientific or otherwise; nor, on account of their slight\r\nand passing character, is medical aid sought. The greatest portion of\r\nthese cases are probably due to ptomaines existing in the food before\r\nbeing consumed; others may be due to the action of unhealthy\r\nfermentation in the intestinal canal itself; in a third class of cases,\r\nit is probable that a true zymotic infection is conveyed and develops in\r\nthe sufferer; the latter class of cases, as, for instance, the\r\nMiddlesborough epidemic of pleuro-pneumonia, is outside the scope of\r\nthis treatise.\r\n\r\nConfining the attention to cases of food poisoning in which the symptoms\r\nhave been closely analysed and described, the reader is referred to\r\nthirteen cases of food poisoning, investigated by the medical officers\r\nof the Local Government Board between the years 1878 and 1891, as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n1878. =A Case of Poisoning at Whitchurch from eating Roast Pork.=--Only\r\nthe leg of pork was poisonous, other parts eaten without injury. Two\r\npersons died after about thirty hours’ illness. The pork itself, on a\r\nparticular Sunday, was innocuous; it became poisonous between the Sunday\r\nand the Monday; the toxicity appeared to gradually increase, for those\r\nwho ate it for dinner on the Monday were not taken ill for periods of\r\nfrom seven to nineteen hours, while two persons who ate of it in the\r\nevening were attacked four hours after eating.\r\n\r\n1880. =The Welbeck Epidemic=, due to eating cold boiled ham. Over fifty\r\npersons affected. Symptoms commenced in from twelve to forty-eight\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n1881. =A Series of Poisoning from eating Baked Pork,\r\nNottingham.=--Probably the gravy was the cause and not the pork itself.\r\nMany persons seriously ill. One died.\r\n\r\n1881. =Tinned American Sausage.=--A man in Chester died from eating\r\ntinned American sausage. Poison found to be unequally distributed in the\r\nsausage.\r\n\r\n1882. =Poisoning at Oldham by Tinned Pigs’ Tongues.=--Two families\r\naffected. Symptoms commenced in about four hours. All recovered. After a\r\nfew days’ keeping it would appear that the poison had been decomposed.\r\n\r\n1882. =A Family Poisoned by Roast Beef at Bishop Stortford.=--Only a\r\nparticular piece of the ribs seemed to be poisonous, the rest of the\r\ncarcase being innocuous. Symptoms did not commence until several hours\r\nafter ingestion.\r\n\r\n1882. =Ten different Families at Whitchurch Poisoned by eating\r\nBrawn.=--First symptoms after about four hours.\r\n\r\n1884. =Tinned Salmon at Wolverhampton.=--Five persons, two being\r\nchildren, ate of tinned salmon at Wolverhampton. All suffered more or\r\nless. The mother’s symptoms began after twelve hours, and she died in\r\nfive days; the son died in three days, the symptoms commencing in ten\r\nhours. The _post-mortem_ signs were similar to those from phosphorus\r\npoisoning, viz., fatty degeneration. Mice fed on the material also\r\nsuffered, and their organs showed a similar degeneration.\r\n\r\n1886. =The Carlisle A Case.=--At a wedding breakfast in Carlisle\r\ntwenty-four persons were poisoned by food which had been kept in an\r\nill-ventilated cellar. The articles suspected were an American ham, an\r\nopen game pie, and certain jellies. The bride died. Symptoms commenced\r\nin from six to forty-three hours.\r\n\r\n1886. =Poisoning by Veal Pie at Iron Bridge.=--Twelve out of fifteen ate\r\nof the pie; all were taken ill in from six to twelve hours.\r\n\r\n1887. =Poisoning at Retford of Eighty Persons from eating Pork Pie or\r\nBrawn.=--Symptoms commenced at various intervals, from eight to\r\nthirty-six hours.\r\n\r\n1889. =The Carlisle B Case.=--Poisoning by pork pies or boiled salt\r\npork. Number of persons attacked, about twenty-five.\r\n\r\n1891. =Poisoning by a Meat Pie at Portsmouth.=--Thirteen persons\r\nsuffered from serious illness. Portions of the pies were poisonous to\r\nmice.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms in all these cases were not precisely alike; but they were\r\nso far identical as to show as great a similarity as in cases when a\r\nnumber of persons are poisoned by the same chemical substance. Arsenic,\r\nfor instance, produces several types of poisoning; so does phosphorus.\r\n\r\nSevere gastro-enteric disturbance, with more or less affection of the\r\nnervous system, were the main characteristics. These symptoms commenced,\r\nas before stated, at various intervals after ingestion of the food; but\r\nthey came on with extreme suddenness. Rigors, prostration, giddiness,\r\noffensive diarrhœa, followed by muscular twitchings, dilatation of the\r\npupil, drowsiness, deepening in bad cases to coma, were commonly\r\nobserved. The _post-mortem_ appearances were those of enteritis, with\r\ninflammatory changes in the kidney and liver. Convalescence was slow;\r\nsometimes there was desquamation of the skin.\r\n\r\nIn many of these cases Dr. Klein found bacteria which, under certain\r\nconditions, were capable of becoming pathogenic; but in no case does\r\nthere seem to have been at the same time an exhaustive chemical inquiry;\r\nso that, although there was evidence of a poison passing through the\r\nkidney, the nature of the poison still remains obscure.\r\n\r\nThe deaths in England and Wales from unwholesome food during ten years\r\nwere as follows:--\r\n\r\nDEATHS IN ENGLAND AND WALES FROM UNWHOLESOME FOOD DURING THE TEN YEARS\r\n1883-1892.\r\n\r\n  +----------+-----+---+-----+---+-----+---+-----+---+-----+----+----+\r\n  |          |1883.|   |1885.|   |1887.|   |1889.|   |1891.|    |To- |\r\n  |           |   |1884.|   |1886.|   |1888.|   |1890.|   |1892.|tal.|\r\n  +-----------+---+-----+---+-----+---+-----+---+-----+---+-----+----+\r\n  |Diseased   | 1 | ... |...| ... |...| ... |...| ... |...| ... |  1 |\r\n  |meat,      |   |     |   |     |   |     |   |     |   |     |    |\r\n  |Poisonous  | 2 |  3  | 2 |  1  | 1 |  4  | 3 |  2  | 9 |  6  | 33 |\r\n  |fish,      |   |     |   |     |   |     |   |     |   |     |    |\r\n  |Unwholesome|...|  1  |...| ... |...| ... |...| ... |...| ... |  1 |\r\n  |brawn,     |   |     |   |     |   |     |   |     |   |     |    |\r\n  |Tinned     |...|  2  |...| ... |...| ... |...| ... |...| ... |  2 |\r\n  |salmon,    |   |     |   |     |   |     |   |     |   |     |    |\r\n  |Putrid     |...|  1  | 1 |  1  |...| ... | 1 | ... |...| ... |  4 |\r\n  |meat,      |   |     |   |     |   |     |   |     |   |     |    |\r\n  |Diseased   |...|  1  |...| ... |...| ... |...| ... |...| ... |  1 |\r\n  |food,      |   |     |   |     |   |     |   |     |   |     |    |\r\n  |Mussels,   |...|  1  |...| ... |...| ... | 1 | ... |...| ... |  2 |\r\n  |Tinned     |...| ... |...| ... | 2 | ... |...| ... |...| ... |  2 |\r\n  |foods,     |   |     |   |     |   |     |   |     |   |     |    |\r\n  |Whelks,    |...| ... |...| ... | 1 | ... |...| ... |...| ... |  1 |\r\n  |Winkles,   |...| ... |...| ... |...| ... |...|  1  |...| ... |  1 |\r\n  |Ptomaines, |...| ... |...| ... |...| ... |...| ... | 1 | ... |  1 |\r\n  |           +---+-----+---+-----+---+-----+---+-----+---+-----+----+\r\n  |           | 3 |  9  | 3 |  2  | 4 |  4  | 5 |  3  |10 |  6  | 49 |\r\n  +-----------+---+-----+---+-----+---+-----+---+-----+---+-----+----+\r\n\r\n§ 687. =German Sausage Poisoning.=--A series of cases may be picked out\r\nfrom the accounts of sausage poisoning in Germany, all of which\r\nevidently depend upon a poison producing the same symptoms, and the\r\nessentially distinctive mark of which is extreme dryness of the skin and\r\nmucous membranes, dilatation of the pupil, and paralysis of the upper\r\neyelids (ptosis). In an uncertain time after eating sausages or some\r\nform of meat, from one to twenty-four hours, there is a general feeling\r\nof uneasiness, a sense of weight about the stomach, nausea, and soon\r\nafterwards vomiting, and very often diarrhœa. The diarrhœa is not\r\nsevere, never assumes a choleraic form, and is unaccompanied by cramps\r\nin the muscles. After a considerable interval there is marked dryness of\r\nthe mucous membrane (a symptom which never fails), the tongue, pharynx,\r\nand the mouth generally seem actually destitute of secretion; there is\r\nalso an absence of perspiration, the nasal mucous membrane participates\r\nin this unnatural want of secretion, the very tears are dried up. In a\r\ncase related by Kraatzer,[678] the patient, losing a son, was much\r\ntroubled, but wept no tear. This dryness leads to changes in the mucous\r\nmembrane, it shrivels, and partly desquamates, aphthous swellings may\r\noccur, and a diffuse redness and diphtheritic-like patches have been\r\nnoticed. There is obstinate constipation, probably from a dryness of the\r\nmucous lining of the intestines. The breath has an unpleasant odour,\r\nthere is often a croupy cough, the urinary secretion alone is not\r\ndecreased but rather augmented. Swallowing may be so difficult as to\r\nrise to the grade of aphagia, and the tongue cannot be manipulated\r\nproperly, so that the speech may be almost unintelligible. At the same\r\ntime, marked symptoms of the motor nerves of the face are present, the\r\npatient’s sight is disturbed, he sees colours or sparks before his eyes;\r\nin a few cases there has been transitory blindness, in others diplopia.\r\nThe pupil in nearly all the cases has been dilated, also in exceptional\r\ninstances it has been contracted. The _levator palpebrae superioris_ is\r\nparalysed, and the resulting ptosis completes the picture. Consciousness\r\nremains intact almost to death, there is excessive weakness of the\r\nmuscles, perhaps from a general paresis. If the patient lives long\r\nenough, he gets wretchedly thin, and dies from marasmus. In more rapidly\r\nfatal cases, death follows from respiratory paralysis, with or without\r\nconvulsions.\r\n\r\n[678] Quoted by Husemann, _Vergiftung durch Wurstgift_ (Maschka’s\r\n_Handbook_).\r\n\r\n=The post-mortem appearances= which have been observed are--the mucous\r\nmembranes of the mouth, gullet, and throat are white, hard, and\r\nparchment-like; that of the stomach is more or less injected with\r\nnumerous hæmorrhages: the kidneys are somewhat congested, with some\r\neffusion of blood in the tubuli; the spleen is large and very full of\r\nblood, and the lungs are often œdematous, pneumonic, or bronchitic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART VIII.--THE OXALIC ACID GROUP OF POISONS.\r\n\r\n§ 688. Oxalic acid is widely distributed both in the free state and in\r\ncombination with bases throughout the vegetable kingdom, and it also\r\noccurs in the animal kingdom. In combination with potash it is found in\r\nthe _Geranium acetosum_ (L.), _Spinacia oleracea_ (L.), _Phytolacca\r\ndecandra_ (L.), _Rheum palmatum_ (L.), _Rumex acetosa_, _Atropa\r\nbelladonna_, and several others; in combination with soda in different\r\nspecies of _Salsola_ and _Salicornia_; and in combination with lime in\r\nmost plants, especially in the roots and bark. Many lichens contain half\r\ntheir weight of calcic oxalate, and oxalic acid, either free or\r\ncombined, is (according to the observations of Hamlet and\r\nPlowright[679]) present in all mature non-microscopic fungi. Crystals of\r\noxalate of lime may be frequently seen by the aid of the microscope in\r\nthe cells of plants. According to Schmidt,[680] this crystallisation\r\nonly takes place in the fully mature cell, for in actively growing cells\r\nthe oxalate of lime is entirely dissolved by the albumen of the plant.\r\n\r\n[679] _Chem. News_, vol. xxxvi. p. 93.\r\n\r\n[680] _Ann. Chem. Pharm._, vol. lxi. p. 297.\r\n\r\nIn the animal kingdom oxalic acid is always present in the intestinal\r\ncontents of the caterpillar. In combination with lime, it is constantly\r\nfound in the allantois liquor of the cow, the urine of man, swine,\r\nhorses, and cats. With regard to human urine, the presence or absence of\r\noxalate of lime greatly depends upon the diet, and also upon the\r\nindividual, some persons almost invariably secreting oxalates, whatever\r\ntheir food may be.\r\n\r\n§ 689. =Oxalic Acid=, H₂C₂O₄2H₂O (90 + 36), specific gravity 1·64,\r\noccurs in commerce in prismatic crystals, very similar to, and liable to\r\nbe mistaken for, either magnesic or zincic sulphates. The crystals are\r\nintensely acid, easily soluble in water (1 part requiring at 14·5° 10·46\r\nparts of water); they are also soluble in parts of cold, and readily in\r\nboiling, alcohol. Oxalic acid is slightly soluble in cold absolute\r\nether; but ether, although extracting most organic acids from an aqueous\r\nsolution, will not extract oxalic acid.\r\n\r\nOxalic acid sublimes slowly at 100°, but rapidly and completely at\r\n150°; the best means of obtaining the pure anhydride is to put a\r\nsufficient quantity of the acid into a strong flask, clamp it by\r\nsuitable connections to a mercury pump, and sublime in a vacuum; in this\r\nway a sufficient quantity may be sublimed a little above 100°. It is\r\nwell to remember, not only its low subliming temperature, but also that\r\nan aqueous solution, if kept at 100°, loses acid; hence all evaporating\r\nor heating operations must not exceed 98°, or there will be some loss.\r\nThe effect of heat is first to drive off water, then, if continued up to\r\nabout 190°, there is decomposition into carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide,\r\nwater, and formic acid; the two reactions occurring simultaneously--\r\n\r\n  C₂H₂O₄ = CO₂ + CO + H₂O.\r\n\r\n  C₂H₂O₄ = CO₂ + CH₂O₂.\r\n\r\nHeated with sulphuric acid to 110°, the following decomposition takes\r\nplace:--\r\n\r\n  H₂C₂O₄ = H₂O + CO₂ + CO.\r\n\r\nOxalic acid decomposes fluor spar, the phosphates of iron, silver, zinc,\r\ncopper, and the arseniates of iron, silver, and copper. It may be used\r\nto separate the sulphides of iron and manganese from the sulphides of\r\nzinc, cadmium, uranium, cobalt, mercury, and copper--dissolving the\r\nformer, not the latter. Many minerals and other substances are also\r\nattacked by this acid.\r\n\r\nIf a solution of oxalic acid in water is boiled with ammonio or sodio\r\nterchloride of gold (avoiding direct exposure to light) the gold is\r\nprecipitated--\r\n\r\n  2AuCl₃ + 3H₂C₂O₄ = 6CO₂ + 6HCl + Au₂.\r\n\r\nWhen black oxide of manganese (free from carbonate) is mixed with an\r\noxalate, and treated with dilute sulphuric acid, the oxalic acid is\r\ndecomposed, and carbon dioxide evolved--\r\n\r\n  MnO₂ + H₂C₂O₄ + H₂SO₄ = MnSO₄ + 2H₂O + 2CO₂.\r\n\r\nA similar reaction occurs with permanganate of potash.\r\n\r\nIf to a solution of oxalic acid, which may be neutralised with an\r\nalkali, or may contain free acetic acid, a solution of acetate of lime\r\nbe added, oxalate of lime is thrown down. This salt, important in an\r\nanalytical point of view, it will be well to describe.\r\n\r\n§ 690. =Oxalate of Lime= (CaC₂O₄H₂O), 1 part ·863 crystallised oxalic\r\nacid. This is the salt which the analyst obtains for the quantitative\r\nestimation of lime or oxalic acid; it is not identical with that\r\noccurring in the vegetable kingdom, the latter containing 3H₂O. Oxalate\r\nof lime cannot be precipitated for quantitative purposes from solutions\r\ncontaining chromium, aluminium, or ferric iron, since somewhat soluble\r\nsalts are formed. It dissolves in solutions of magnesium and\r\nmanganese,[681] and citrate of soda, and is also decomposed by boiling\r\nwith solutions of copper, silver, lead, cadmium, zinc, nickel, cobalt,\r\nstrontium, or barium. It is insoluble in solutions of chlorides of the\r\nalkalies and alkaline earths, and in water, in alkaline solutions, or in\r\nacetic acid; and is soluble in mineral acid only when the acid is strong\r\nand in considerable excess. It is unalterable in the air, and at 100°.\r\nWhen carefully and slowly ignited it may be wholly converted into\r\ncarbonate of lime; if the heat is not properly managed (that is, if\r\nexcessive), caustic lime may be formed in greater or smaller quantity.\r\n\r\n[681] But it is reprecipitated unaltered by excess of alkaline oxalate.\r\n\r\n§ 691. =Use in the Arts.=--Oxalic acid is chiefly used by dyers and\r\ncalico-printers, but also by curriers and harness-makers for cleaning\r\nleather, by marble masons for removing iron stains, by workers in straw\r\nfor bleaching, and it is applied to various household purposes,[682]\r\nsuch as the whitening of boards, the removing of iron-mould from linen,\r\n&c. The hydropotassic oxalate (binoxalate of potash), under the popular\r\nnames of “_essential salt of lemons_” and salts of sorrel, is used for\r\nscouring metals and for removing ink-stains from linen.\r\n\r\n[682] A “Liquid Blue,” used for laundry purposes, contains much free\r\noxalic acid.\r\n\r\n§ 692. =Hydropotassic Oxalate, Binoxalate of Potash=, KHC₂O₄(H₂O), is a\r\nwhite salt, acid in reaction, soluble in water, and insoluble in\r\nalcohol. Heated on platinum foil it leaves potassic carbonate, which may\r\nbe recognised by the usual tests. Its aqueous solution gives, with a\r\nsolution of acetate or sulphate of lime, a precipitate of calcic oxalate\r\ninsoluble in acetic acid.\r\n\r\n§ 693. =Statistics.=--Poisoning by oxalic acid is more frequent in\r\nEngland than in any other European country. In the ten years 1883-92,\r\nthere were registered in England and Wales 222 deaths from oxalic\r\nacid--of these 199, or 89·6 per cent., were suicidal, the remainder\r\naccidental. The age and sex distribution of these cases is set out in\r\nthe following table:--\r\n\r\nPOISONING BY OXALIC ACID IN ENGLAND AND WALES DURING THE TEN YEARS\r\n1883-1892.\r\n\r\n                       ACCIDENT OR NEGLIGENCE.\r\n\r\n  Ages,          0-1  1-5  5-15  15-25  25-65  65 and  Total\r\n                                               above\r\n  Males,          1   ...   ...     2    ...     14      17\r\n  Females,      ...   ...   ...     1      5    ...       6\r\n               ---------------------------------------------\r\n    Total,        1   ...   ...     3      5     14      23\r\n               ---------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                              SUICIDE.\r\n\r\n  Ages,                          15-25  25-65  65 and  Total\r\n                                               above\r\n  Males,                            9    102      3     114\r\n  Females,                         21     62      2      85\r\n                                ----------------------------\r\n    Total,                         30    164      5     199\r\n                                ----------------------------\r\n\r\n§ 694. =Fatal Dose.=--The smallest dose of oxalic acid known to have\r\ndestroyed life is, according to Dr. Taylor, 3·88 grms. (60 grains); but\r\nrecovery has taken place, on prompt administration of remedies, after\r\neight times this quantity has been swallowed.\r\n\r\nWith regard to oxalate of soda, or binoxalate of potash, 14·2 grms.\r\n(half an ounce) have been taken without fatal result, although the\r\nsymptoms were very serious; and it may be held that about that quantity\r\nwould usually cause death. Oxalic acid is not used in medicine, save as\r\na salt, _e.g._, oxalate of cerium.\r\n\r\n§ 695. =Effects of Oxalic Acid and Oxalates on Animals.=--The first\r\ncases of poisoning by oxalic acid occurred early in the nineteenth\r\ncentury, a little more than fifty years after its discovery.\r\nThompson[683] was the first who attempted, by experiment on animal life,\r\nto elucidate the action of the poison; he noted the caustic action on\r\nthe stomach, and the effects on the heart and nervous system, which he\r\nattributed simply to the local injury through the sympathetic nerves.\r\nOrfila[684] was the next who took the matter up, and he made several\r\nexperiments; but it was Robert Christison[685] who distinctly recognised\r\nthe important fact that oxalic acid was toxic, quite apart from any\r\nlocal effects, and that the soluble oxalates, such as sodic and potassic\r\noxalates, were violent poisons.\r\n\r\n[683] _Lond. Med. Rep._, vol. iii. p. 382.\r\n\r\n[684] _Traité de Toxicologie._\r\n\r\n[685] _Edin. Med. and Surg. Journ._, 1823.\r\n\r\n§ 696. Kobert and Küssner[686] have made some extended researches on the\r\neffects of sodic oxalate on rabbits, cats, dogs, guinea-pigs, hedgehogs,\r\nfrogs, &c.--the chief results of which are as follows:--On injection of\r\nsodic oxalate solution in moderate doses into the circulation, the\r\nheart’s action, and, therefore, the pulse, become arhythmic; and a\r\ndicrotic or tricrotic condition of the pulse may last even half a day,\r\nwhile at the same time the frequency may be uninfluenced. The\r\nblood-pressure also with moderate doses is normal, and with small atoxic\r\ndoses there is no slowing of the respiration. On the other hand, toxic\r\ndoses paralyse the respiratory apparatus, and the animal dies\r\nasphyxiated. With chronic and subacute poisoning the respiration becomes\r\nslower and slower, and then ceases from paralysis of the respiratory\r\nmuscles. The first sign of poisoning, whether acute or chronic, is a\r\nsleepy condition; dogs lie quiet, making now and then a noise as if\r\ndreaming, mechanical irritations are responded to with dulness. The hind\r\nextremities become weak, and then the fore. This paresis of the hind\r\nextremities, deepening into complete paralysis, was very constant and\r\nstriking. Take, for example, from the paper (_op. cit._) the experiment\r\nin which a large cat received in six days five subcutaneous injections\r\nof 5 c.c. of a solution of sodic oxalate (strength 1 : 30), equalling\r\n·16 grm.; the cat died, as it were, gradually from behind forwards, so\r\nthat on the sixth day the hinder extremities were fully motionless and\r\nwithout feeling. The heart beat strongly. The temperature of the\r\npoisoned animal always sinks below the normal condition. Convulsions in\r\nacute poisoning are common, in chronic quite absent; when present in\r\nacute poisoning, they are tetanic or strychnic-like. In all the\r\nexperiments of Kobert and Küssner, lethal doses of soluble oxalates\r\ncaused the appearance of sugar in the urine.\r\n\r\n[686] _Exper. Wirkungen der Oxalsäure, Virch. Archiv_, Bd. lxxvii. S.\r\n209.\r\n\r\nJ. Uppmann[687] made forty-nine experiments on dogs, in which he\r\nadministered relatively large doses by the stomach; no poisonous effect\r\nfollowed. Emil Pfeiffer[688] gave a dog in three successive days ·2, ·5,\r\nand lastly 1 grm. oxalic acid with meat, but no symptoms resulted. Yet\r\nthat oxalic acid, as sodic oxalate, is poisonous to dogs, if it once\r\ngets into the circulation, cannot be disputed. The accepted explanation\r\nis that the large amount of lime phosphates in the digestive canal of\r\ndogs is decomposed by oxalic acid, and the harmless lime oxalate formed.\r\n\r\n[687] _Allg. Med. central Ztg._, 1877.\r\n\r\n[688] _Archiv der Pharm._ (3 R.), Bd. xiii. S. 544, 1878.\r\n\r\nOxalic acid is absorbed into the blood, and leeches have been known to\r\ndie after their application to a person who had taken a large dose. Thus\r\nChristison[689] quotes a case related by Dr. Arrowsmith, in which this\r\noccurred:--“They were healthy, and fastened immediately; on looking at\r\nthem a few minutes after, I remarked that they did not seem to fill, and\r\non touching one it felt hard, and instantly fell off motionless and\r\ndead; the others were in the same state. They had all bitten, and the\r\nmarks were conspicuous, but they had drawn scarcely any blood. They were\r\napplied about six hours after the acid had been taken.”\r\n\r\n[689] _Treatise on Poisons._\r\n\r\n§ 697. =Effects of Vaporised Oxalic Acid.=--Eulenberg has experimented\r\non pigeons on the action of oxalic acid when breathed. In one of his\r\nexperiments, ·75 grm. of the acid was volatilised into a glass shade, in\r\nwhich a pigeon had been placed; after this had been done five times in\r\ntwo minutes, there was uneasiness, shaking of the head, and cough, with\r\nincreased mucous secretion of the nasal membrane. On continuing the\r\ntransmission of the vapour, after eight minutes there was again\r\nrestlessness, shaking of the head, and cough; after eleven minutes the\r\nbird fell and was convulsed. On discontinuing the sublimation, it got up\r\nand moved freely, but showed respiratory irritation. On the second day\r\nafter the experiment, it was observed that the bird’s note was hoarse,\r\non the fourth day there was slowness of the heart’s action and refusal\r\nof food, and on the sixth day the bird was found dead. Examination after\r\ndeath showed slight injection of the cerebral membranes; the cellular\r\ntissue in the neighbourhood of the trachea contained in certain places\r\nextravasations of blood, varying from the size of a pea to that of a\r\npenny; the mucous membrane of the larynx and trachea was swollen and\r\ncovered with a thick croupous layer; the lungs were partially hepatised,\r\nand the pleura thickened; the crop as well as the true intestines still\r\ncontained some food.[690]\r\n\r\n[690] _Gewerbe Hygiene_, p. 423.\r\n\r\n§ 698. =The Effects of Oxalic Acid and Hydropotassic Oxalate on\r\nMan.=--The cases of oxalic poisoning have been invariably due to either\r\noxalic acid or hydropotassic oxalate, the neutral sodic or potassic\r\noxalates having hitherto in no instance been taken. The symptoms, and\r\neven the locally destructive action of oxalic acid and the acid oxalate,\r\nare so similar that neither from clinical nor _post-mortem_ signs could\r\nthey be differentiated by anyone not having a previous knowledge of the\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nThe external application of oxalic acid does not appear to cause\r\nillness; workmen engaged in trades requiring the constant use of the\r\nacid often have the nails white, opaque, and brittle; but no direct\r\ninjury to health is on record.\r\n\r\nA large dose of either causes a local and a remote effect; the local is\r\nvery similar to that already described as belonging to the mineral\r\nacids, i.e., more or less destructive of the mucous membranes with which\r\nthe acid comes in contact. The remote effects may only be developed\r\nafter a little; they consist essentially of a profound influence on the\r\nnervous system. Though more than 120 cases of oxalic acid poisoning have\r\noccurred since Christison wrote his treatise, his graphic description\r\nstill holds good. “If,” says he, “a person immediately after swallowing\r\na solution of a crystalline salt, which tasted purely and strongly acid,\r\nis attacked with burning in the throat, then with burning in the\r\nstomach, vomiting, particularly of bloody matter, imperceptible pulse,\r\nand excessive languor, and dies in half an hour, or still more, in\r\ntwenty, fifteen, or ten minutes, I do not know any fallacy which can\r\ninterfere with the conclusion that oxalic acid was the cause of death.\r\nNo parallel disease begins so abruptly, and terminates so soon; and no\r\nother crystalline poison has the same effect.” The local action is that\r\nof a solvent on the mucous tissues. If from 10 to 30 grms. are\r\nswallowed, dissolved in water, there is an immediate sour taste, pain,\r\nburning in the stomach, and vomiting. The vomit may be colourless,\r\ngreenish, or black, and very acid; but there is a considerable variety\r\nin the symptoms. The variations may be partly explained by saying that,\r\nin one class of cases, the remote or true toxic effects of the poison\r\npredominate; in a second, the local and the nervous are equally divided;\r\nwhile in a third, the local effects seem alone to give rise to symptoms.\r\n\r\nIn a case at Guy’s Hospital, in 1842, there was no pain, but vomiting\r\nand collapse. In another case which occurred in 1870, a male (aged 48)\r\ntook 10·4 grms. (162 grains); he had threatening collapse, cold sweats,\r\nwhite and red patches on the tongue and pharynx, difficulty in\r\nswallowing, and contracted pupils. Blood was effused from the mouth and\r\nanus; on the following day there were convulsions, coma, and death\r\nthirty-six hours after taking the poison. In another case, there was\r\nrapid loss of consciousness and coma, followed by death in five hours.\r\nDeath may be very rapid, _e.g._, in one case (_Med. Times and Gaz._,\r\n1868) it took place in ten minutes; there was bleeding from the stomach,\r\nwhich doubtless accelerated the fatal result. Orfila has recorded a\r\ndeath almost as rapid from the acid oxalate of potash; a woman took 15\r\ngrms.; there was no vomiting, but she suffered from fearful cramps, and\r\ndeath ensued in fifteen minutes. In another case, also recorded by\r\nOrfila, there was marked slowing of the pulse, and soporific tendencies.\r\nWith both oxalic acid and the acid oxalate of potash, certain nervous\r\nand other sequelæ are more or less constant, always provided time is\r\ngiven for their development. From the experiments already detailed on\r\nanimals, one would expect some paresis of the lower extremities, but\r\nthis has not been observed in man. There is more or less inflammation of\r\nthe stomach, and often peritonitis; in one case (_Brit. Med. Journal_,\r\n1873) there were cystitis and acute congestion of the kidneys with\r\nalbuminuria.\r\n\r\nIn two cases quoted by Taylor, there was a temporary loss or\r\nenfeeblement of voice; in one of the two, the aphonia lasted for eight\r\ndays. In the other, that of a man who had swallowed about 7 grms. (¼\r\noz.) of oxalic acid, his voice, naturally deep, became in nine hours low\r\nand feeble, and continued so for more than a month, during the whole of\r\nwhich time he suffered in addition from numbness and tingling of the\r\nlegs. As a case of extreme rarity may be mentioned that of a young\r\nwoman,[691] who took 12 grms. (185 grains) of the acid oxalate of\r\npotash, and on the third day died; before death exhibiting delirium so\r\nactive and intense that it was described as “madness.”\r\n\r\n[691] _Journ. de Chim. Méd._, 1839, p. 564.\r\n\r\n§ 699. =Physiological Action.=--Putting on one side the _local_ effects\r\nof oxalic acid, and regarding only its true toxic effects, there is some\r\ndifference of opinion as to its action. L. Hermann considers it one of\r\nthe heart poisons, having seen the frog’s heart arrested by subcutaneous\r\ndoses of sodic oxalate, an observation which is borne out by the\r\nexperiments of Cyon,[692] and not negatived by those of Kobert and\r\nKüssner. The poison is believed to act on the extracardial ganglia.\r\nOnsum[693] held at one time a peculiar theory of the action of oxalic\r\nacid, believing that it precipitated as oxalate of lime in the lung\r\ncapillaries, causing embolic obstruction; but this view is not now\r\naccepted--there are too many obvious objections to it. Kobert and\r\nKüssner do not consider oxalic acid a heart poison, but believe that its\r\naction is directed to the central nervous system, as attested by sinking\r\nof the blood-pressure, the arhythm and retardation of the pulse, the\r\nslow breathing, the paralytic symptoms, and the fibrillary muscular\r\ncontraction; but, with regard to the latter, Locke[694] has observed\r\nthat a frog’s sartorius, immersed in 0·75 sodium oxalate solution,\r\nbecomes in a few seconds violently active, much more so than in\r\nBiederman’s normal saline solution. After thirty to forty-five minutes\r\nit loses its irritability, which, however, it partially recovers by\r\nimmersion in 0·6 sodium chloride solution. He thinks this may explain\r\nthe symptoms of fibrillary muscular contraction observed by Kobert and\r\nKüssner, which they ascribe to an action on the central nervous system.\r\n\r\n[692] _Virch. Archiv_, Bd. xx. S. 233.\r\n\r\n[693] Almen afterwards supported Onsum’s view; he made a number of\r\nmicroscopical observations, and appears to have been the first who\r\nidentified oxalate of lime in the kidneys (Upsala, _Läkareförenings\r\nförhandl._, Bd. ii. Hft. iv. S. 265).\r\n\r\n[694] F. S. Locke, _J. Phys._, xv. 119; _Journ. Chem. Soc._, 1893, 480.\r\n\r\n§ 700. =Pathological Changes.=--Kobert and Küssner observed that when\r\noxalate of soda was subcutaneously injected into animals, there was\r\noften abscess, and even gangrene, at the seat of the injection. If the\r\npoison were injected into the peritoneal cavity, death was so rapid as\r\nto leave little time for any coarse lesions to manifest themselves. They\r\nwere not able to observe a cherry-red colour of the blood, nor did they\r\nfind oxalate of lime crystals in the lung capillaries; there were often\r\nembolic processes in the lung, but nothing typical. They came,\r\ntherefore, to the conclusion that the state of the kidneys and the urine\r\nwas the only typical sign. The kidneys were dark, full of blood, but did\r\nnot show any microscopic hæmorrhages. Twelve hours after taking the\r\npoison there is observed in the cortical substance a fine striping\r\ncorresponding to the canaliculi; in certain cases the whole boundary\r\nlayer is coloured white. If the poisoning lasts a longer time, the\r\nkidneys become less blood-rich, and show the described white striping\r\nvery beautifully; this change persists several weeks. The cause of this\r\nstrange appearance is at once revealed by a microscopical examination;\r\nit is due to a deposition of oxalate of lime; no crystals are met with\r\nin the glomerules. Both by the microscope and by chemical means it may\r\nbe shown that the content of the kidney in oxalates is large.[695] So\r\nfar as the tissues generally are concerned, free oxalic acid is not\r\nlikely to be met with; there is always present sufficient lime to form\r\nlime oxalate. The urine was always albuminous and contained a reducing\r\nsubstance, which vanished about the second day after the dose. Hyaline\r\ncasts and deposits of oxalates in the urine never failed.[696]\r\n\r\n[695] The important fact of the oxalate-content of kidneys and urine,\r\nand the expulsion of casts, was first observed by Mitscherlich in 1854.\r\nHe noticed in a rabbit, to which had been given 7·5 grms. of oxalic\r\nacid, and which had died in thirteen minutes, “_renes paululum magis\r\nsanguine replete videbantur, in urina multa corpora inveniebantur, quæ\r\ntubulos Bellenianos explese videntur_” (_De acidi acetici, oxalici,\r\ntartarici, citrici, formici, et boracici, &c., Berlin_).\r\n\r\n[696] Rabuteau has discovered by experiment that even the oxalates of\r\niron and copper are decomposed and separated by the kidneys. _Gaz. Méd.\r\nde Paris_, 1874.\r\n\r\n§ 701. Observations of the pathological effects of the oxalates on man\r\nhave been confined to cases of death from the corrosive substances\r\nmentioned, and hence the intestinal tract has been profoundly affected.\r\n\r\nIn the museum of St. Thomas’ Hospital is a good example of the effects\r\nproduced. The case was that of a woman who had taken a large, unknown\r\nquantity of oxalic acid, and was brought to the hospital dead. The\r\nmucous membrane of the gullet is much corrugated and divided into\r\nnumerous parallel grooves, these again by little transverse grooves, so\r\nthat the intersection of the two systems makes a sort of raised pattern.\r\nIt is noted that in the recent state the mucous membrane could be\r\nremoved in flakes; in the upper part it was whitish, in the lower\r\nslate-coloured. The stomach has a large perforation, but placing the\r\nspecimen beside another in the same museum which illustrates the effect\r\nof the gastric juice, in causing an after-death solution of a portion of\r\nthe stomach, I was unable to differentiate between the two. The mucous\r\nmembrane had the same shreddy flocculent appearance, and is soft and\r\npale. The pyloric end is said to have been of a blackish colour, and no\r\nlymph was exuded.\r\n\r\n§ 702. The pathological changes by the acid oxalate of potash are\r\nidentical with those of oxalic acid, in both the gullet and stomach\r\nbeing nearly always more or less inflamed or corroded; the inflammation\r\nin a few cases has extended right through into the intestinal canal;\r\nthere are venous hyperæmia, hæmorrhages, and swelling of the mucous\r\nmembrane of the stomach. The hæmorrhages are often punctiform, but\r\noccasionally larger, arranged in rows on the summits of the rugæ;\r\nsometimes there is considerable bleeding. In the greater number of cases\r\nthere is no actual erosion of the stomach, but the inner layer appears\r\nabnormally transparent. On examining the mucous membrane under the\r\nmicroscope, Lesser[697] has described it as covered with a layer which\r\nstrongly reflects light, and is to be considered as caused by a fine\r\nprecipitate of calcic oxalate. Lesser was unable to find in any case\r\noxalic acid crystals, or those of the acid oxalate of potash. There are\r\nmany cases of perforation on record, but it is questionable whether they\r\nare not all to be regarded as _post-mortem_ effects, and not\r\nlife-changes; at all events, there is little clinical evidence to\r\nsupport the view that these perforations occur during life. In the case\r\n(mentioned _ante_) in which death took place by coma, the brain was\r\nhyperæmic. The kidneys, as in the case of animals, show the white zone,\r\nand are congested, and can be proved by microscopical and chemical\r\nmeans to be rich in oxalates.\r\n\r\n[697] Virchow’s _Archiv_, Bd. lxxxiii. S. 218, 1881.\r\n\r\n§ 703. =Separation of Oxalic Acid from Organic Substances, the Tissues\r\nof the Body, &c.=--From what has been stated, no investigation as to the\r\ncause of poison, when oxalic acid is suspected, can be considered\r\ncomplete unless the analyst has an opportunity of examining both the\r\nurine and the kidneys; for although, in most cases--when the acid\r\nitself, or the acid potassic salt has been taken--there may be ample\r\nevidence, both chemical and pathological, it is entirely different if a\r\ncase of poisoning with the neutral sodic salt should occur. In this\r\nevent, there may be no congested appearance of any portion of the\r\nintestinal canal, and the evidence must mainly rest on the urine and\r\nkidneys.\r\n\r\nOxalic acid being so widely distributed in the vegetable kingdom, the\r\nexpert must expect, in any criminal case, to be cross-examined by\r\ningenious counsel as to whether or not it was possible that the acid\r\ncould have entered the body in a rhubarb-pie, or accidentally through\r\nsorrel mixed with greens, &c. To meet these and similar questions it is\r\nimportant to identify, if possible, any green matters found in the\r\nstomach. In any case, it must be remembered, that although rhubarb has\r\nbeen eaten for centuries, and every schoolboy has occasionally chewed\r\nsmall portions of sorrel, no poisoning has resulted from these\r\npractices. When oxalic acid has been taken into the stomach, it will\r\ninvariably be found partly in combination with lime, soda, ammonia, &c.,\r\nand partly free; or if such antidotes as chalk has been administered, it\r\nmay be wholly combined. Vomiting is nearly always present, and valuable\r\nevidence of oxalic acid may be obtained from stains on sheets, carpets,\r\n&c. In a recent case of probably suicidal poisoning, the writer found no\r\noxalic acid in the contents of the stomach, but some was detected in the\r\ncopious vomit which had stained the bed-clothes. The urine also\r\ncontained a great excess of oxalate of lime--a circumstance of little\r\nvalue taken by itself, but confirmatory with other evidence. If a liquid\r\nis strongly acid, oxalic acid may be separated by dialysis from organic\r\nmatters, and the clear fluid thus obtained precipitated by sulphate of\r\nlime, the oxalate of lime being identified by its microscopic form and\r\nother characters.\r\n\r\nThe usual general method for the separation of oxalic acid from organic\r\nsubstances or mixtures is the following:--Extract with boiling water,\r\nfilter (which in some cases must be difficult or even impossible), and\r\nthen precipitate with acetate of lead. The lead precipitate may contain,\r\nbesides oxalate of lead, phosphate, chloride, sulphate, and various\r\norganic substances and acids. This is to be decomposed by sulphuretted\r\nhydrogen, and on filtering off the sulphide of lead, oxalic acid is to\r\nbe tested for in the filtrate. This process can only be adopted with\r\nadvantage in a few cases, and is by no means to be recommended as\r\ngenerally applicable. The best general method, and one which insures\r\nthe separation of oxalic acid, whether present as a free acid, as an\r\nalkaline, or a calcic oxalate, is perhaps the following:--The substance\r\nor fluid under examination is digested with hydrochloric acid until a\r\nfluid capable of filtration is obtained; the free acid is neutralised by\r\nammonia in very slight excess, and permitted to deposit, and the fluid\r\nis then carefully decanted, and the deposit thrown on a filter. The\r\nfiltrate is added to the decanted fluid, and precipitated with a slight\r\nexcess of acetate of lime--this precipitate, like the first, being\r\ncollected on a filter. The first precipitate contains all the oxalic\r\nacid which was in combination with lime; the second, all that which was\r\nin the free condition. Both precipitates should be washed with acetic\r\nacid. The next step is to identify the precipitate which is supposed to\r\nbe oxalate of lime. The precipitate is washed into a beaker, and\r\ndissolved with the aid of heat by adding, drop by drop, pure\r\nhydrochloric acid; it is then reprecipitated by ammonia, and allowed to\r\nsubside completely, which may take some time. The supernatant fluid is\r\ndecanted, and the precipitate washed by subsidence; it is lastly dried\r\nover the water-bath in a tared porcelain dish, and its weight taken. The\r\nsubstance is then identified by testing the dried powder as follows:--\r\n\r\n(_a_) It is whitish in colour, and on ignition in a platinum dish leaves\r\na grey carbonate of lime. All other organic salts of lime--viz.,\r\ncitrate, tartrate, &c.--on ignition become coal-black.\r\n\r\n(_b_) A portion suspended in water, to which is added some sulphuric\r\nacid, destroys the colour of permanganate of potash--the reaction being\r\nsimilar to that on p. 511--a reaction by which, as is well known, oxalic\r\nacid or an oxalate may be conveniently titrated. This reaction is so\r\npeculiar to oxalic acid, that there is no substance with which it can be\r\nconfounded. It is true that uric acid in an acid solution equally\r\ndecolorises permanganate, but it does so in a different way; the\r\nreaction between oxalic acid and permanganate being at first slow, and\r\nafterwards rapid, while the reaction with uric acid is just the\r\nreverse--at first quick, and towards the end of the process extremely\r\nslow.\r\n\r\n(_c_) A portion placed in a test-tube, and warmed with concentrated\r\nsulphuric acid, develops on warming carbon oxide and carbon dioxide; the\r\npresence of the latter is easily shown by adapting a cork and bent tube\r\nto the test-tube, and leading the evolved gases through baryta water.\r\n\r\nAlexander Gunn[698] has described a new method of both detecting and\r\nestimating oxalic acid; it is based on the fact that a small trace of\r\noxalic acid, added to an acid solution of ferrous phosphate, strikes a\r\npersistent lemon-yellow colour; the depth of colour being proportionate\r\nto the amount of oxalic acid.\r\n\r\n[698] _Pharm. Journal_, 1893, 408.\r\n\r\nThe reagents necessary for both quantitative and qualitative testing are\r\nas follows:--A standard solution of oxalic acid, of which 100 c.c. equal\r\n1 grm., and a solution of ferrous phosphate, containing about 12·5 per\r\ncent. of Fe₃2PO₄, with excess of phosphoric acid.\r\n\r\nInto each of two Nessler graduated glasses 7·5 c.c. of the ferrous\r\nphosphate solution are run and made up to 50 c.c. with distilled water;\r\nboth solutions should be colourless; 1, 2, or more c.c. of the solution\r\nto be tested are then run into one of the Nessler glasses; if oxalic\r\nacid be present, a more or less deep tint is produced; this must be\r\nimitated by running the standard solution of oxalic acid into the second\r\nNessler cylinder--the calculation is the same as in other colorimetric\r\nestimations. It does not appear to be reliable quantitatively, if alum\r\nis present; and it is self-evident that the solution to be tested must\r\nbe fairly free from colour.\r\n\r\n§ 704. =Oxalate of Lime in the Urine.=--This well-known urinary sediment\r\noccurs chiefly as octahedra, but hour-glass, contracted or dumbbell-like\r\nbodies, compound octahedra, and small, flattened, bright discs, not\r\nunlike blood discs, are frequently seen. It may be usually identified\r\nunder the field of the microscope by its insolubility in acetic acid,\r\nwhilst the ammonio mag. phosphate, as well as the carbonate of lime, are\r\nboth soluble in that acid. From urates it is distinguished by its\r\ninsolubility in warm water. A chemical method of separation is as\r\nfollows:--The deposit is freed by subsidence as much as possible from\r\nurine, washed with hot water, and then dissolved in hydrochloric acid\r\nand filtered; to the filtrate ammonia is added in excess. The\r\nprecipitate may contain phosphates of iron, magnesia, lime, and oxalate\r\nof lime. On treatment of the precipitate by acetic acid, the phosphates\r\nof the alkaline earths (if present) dissolve; the insoluble portion will\r\nbe either phosphate of iron, or oxalate of lime, or both. On igniting\r\nthe residue in a platinum dish, any oxalate will be changed to\r\ncarbonate, and the carbonate of lime may be titrated with d. n. HCl acid\r\nand cochineal solution, and from the data thus obtained the oxalate\r\nestimated. The iron can be tested qualitatively in the acid solution by\r\nferrocyanide of potassium, or it can be determined by the ordinary\r\nmethods. If the qualitative detection of oxalate of lime in the deposit\r\nis alone required, it is quite sufficient evidence should the portion\r\ninsoluble in acetic acid, on ignition in a platinum dish, give a residue\r\neffervescing on the addition of an acid.\r\n\r\n§ 705. =Estimation of Oxalic Acid.=--Oxalic acid is estimated in the\r\nfree state by direct weighing, or by titration either with alkali or by\r\npotassic permanganate, the latter being standardised by oxalic acid. If\r\n(as is commonly the case) oxalic acid is precipitated as oxalate of\r\nlime, the oxalate may be--\r\n\r\n(_a_) Dried at 100° and weighed directly, having the properties already\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Titrated with dilate sulphuric acid and permanganate.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Ignited, and the resulting carbonate of lime weighed; or dissolved\r\nin standard acid and titrated back--one part of calcic carbonate\r\ncorresponds to 1·26 part of crystallised oxalic acid, or 0·90 part of\r\nH₂C₂O₄; similarly, 1 c.c. of standard acid equals ·05 of calcic\r\ncarbonate (or ·063 of crystallised oxalic acid).\r\n\r\n(_d_) The oxalate may be dissolved in the smallest possible amount of\r\nhydrochloric acid, and boiled with ammonio chloride of gold, avoiding\r\nexposure to light; every part of gold precipitated corresponds to ·961\r\npart of crystallised oxalic acid.\r\n\r\n(_e_) The oxalate may be placed in Geissler’s carbonic acid apparatus,\r\nwith peroxide of manganese and diluted sulphuric acid. The weight of the\r\ngas which at the end of the operation has escaped, will have a definite\r\nrelation to that of the oxalate, and if multiplied by 1·4318 will give\r\nthe amount of crystallised oxalic acid.\r\n\r\n\r\nCERTAIN OXALIC BASES--OXALMETHYLINE--OXALPROPYLINE.\r\n\r\n    § 706. Hugh Schulz[699] and Mayer have contributed the results of\r\n    some important researches bearing upon a more exact knowledge of the\r\n    effects of the oxalic group of poisons, and upon the relation\r\n    between chemical constitution and physiological effects. They\r\n    experimented upon _oxalmethyline_, _chloroxalmethyline_, and\r\n    _oxalpropyline_.\r\n\r\n[699] _Beitrag zur Kenntniss der Wirkung der Oxalbasen auf den\r\nThierkörper. Arch. f. exper.

The sulphur dissolves, and\r\nis held in solution by the solvent, which latter forms a clear upper\r\nlayer. If traces of a metallic sulphide were mixed with the sulphur,\r\nthin coloured films are seen at the junction of the two layers, and the\r\nsulphides may also coat the tube above the level of the liquid with a\r\nslight faintly-coloured pellicle (_Chem. News_, Jan. 4, 1895).\r\n\r\n\r\n1. ARSENIC.\r\n\r\n§ 707. =Metallic Arsenic=, at. wt. 75, specific gravity of solid 5·62 to\r\n5·96, sublimes without fusion in small quantities at 110° (230° F.)\r\n_Guy_. It occurs in commerce in whitish-grey, somewhat brittle,\r\ncrystalline masses, and is obtained by subjecting arsenical pyrites to\r\nsublimation in earthen retorts, the arsenic being deposited in suitable\r\nreceivers on sheet iron. Metallic arsenic is probably not poisonous, but\r\nmay be changed by the animal fluids into soluble compounds, and then\r\nexert toxic effects--volatilised metallic arsenic is easily transformed\r\nin the presence of air into arsenious acid, and is therefore intensely\r\npoisonous.\r\n\r\n§ 708. =Arsenious Anhydride--Arsenious Acid--White Arsenic--Arsenic=,\r\nAs₂O₃ = 198; specific gravity of vapour, 13·85; specific gravity of\r\nopaque variety, 3·699; specific gravity of transparent variety, 3·7385.\r\nComposition in 100 parts, As 75·75, O 24·25; therefore one part of\r\nmetallic arsenic equals 1·32 of As₂O₃. It is entirely volatilised at a\r\ntemperature of 204·4°.\r\n\r\nIn analysis it is obtained in brilliant octahedral crystals as a\r\nsublimate on discs of glass, or within tubes, the result of heating a\r\nfilm of metallic arsenic with access of air. It is obtained in commerce\r\non a very large scale from the roasting of arsenical pyrites. As thus\r\nderived, it is usually in the form of a white cake, the arsenious acid\r\nexisting in two forms--an amorphous and a crystalline--the cake being\r\ngenerally opaque externally, whilst in the centre it is transparent.\r\nAccording to Kruger, this change from the crystalline to the amorphous\r\ncondition is dependent upon the absorption of moisture, no alteration\r\ntaking place in dry air. Both varieties of arsenious anhydride are acid\r\nto test-paper.\r\n\r\nThe solubility of arsenious acid is often a question involving chemical\r\nlegal matters of great moment. Unfortunately, however, no precisely\r\ndefinite statement can be made on this point, the reason being that the\r\ntwo varieties of arsenic occur in very different proportions in\r\ndifferent samples. Both the amorphous and crystalline varieties having\r\nvery unequal solubilities, every experimenter in succession has given a\r\ndifferent series of figures, the only agreement amid the general\r\ndiscrepancy being that arsenic is very sparingly soluble in water.\r\n\r\nThe statement of Taylor may, however, be accepted as very near the\r\ntruth, viz., that an ounce of cold water dissolves from half a grain to\r\na grain. According to M. L. A. Buchner,[701] one part of crystalline\r\narsenious acid dissolves after twenty-four hours’ digestion in 355 parts\r\nof water at 15°; and the amorphous, under the same condition, in 108 of\r\nwater. A boiling solution of the crystalline acid, left to stand for\r\ntwenty-four hours, retains one part of acid in 46 of water; a similar\r\nsolution of the amorphous retains one of arsenic in 30 parts of water,\r\n_i.e._, 100 parts of water dissolve from 2·01 to 3·3 parts of As₂O₃.\r\n\r\n[701] _Bull. de la Société Chem. de Paris_, t. xx. 10, 1873.\r\n\r\nBoiling water poured on the powdered substance retains in cooling a\r\ngrain and a quarter to the ounce; in other words, 100 parts of water\r\nretain ·10. Lastly, arsenious acid boiled in water for an hour is\r\ndissolved in the proportion of 12 grains to the ounce, _i.e._, 100 parts\r\nof water retain 2·5.\r\n\r\nK. Chodomisky[702] has investigated the solubility of recrystallised\r\narsenious acid in dilute acids, and his results are as follows:--100\r\nc.c. of 1·32 per cent. hydrochloric acid dissolves 1·15 grm. As₂O₃ at\r\n18·5°. 100 c.c. of 6 per cent. hydrochloric acid dissolves 1·27 grm. at\r\n18·5°. 100 c.c. of pure hydrochloric acid of the ordinary commercial\r\nstrength dissolves 1·45 grm. As₂O₃. 100 c.c. of dilute sulphuric acid at\r\n18° dissolves about 0·54 grm.; at 18·5° from 0·65 to 0·72 grm.; and at\r\n80° from 1·09 to 1·19 grm.\r\n\r\n[702] _Chem. Centrbl._, 1889, 569.\r\n\r\n§ 709. =Arsine--Arseniuretted Hydrogen=, H₃As.--Mol. weight, 78; vol.\r\nweight, 39; specific gravity, 2·702; weight of a litre, 3·4944 grammes;\r\npercentage composition, 95·69 As, 4·31 H; volumetric composition, 2 vol.\r\nH₃As = half vol. As + 3 vol. H. A colourless inflammable gas, of a\r\nfœtid alliaceous odour, coercible into a limpid colourless liquid at a\r\ntemperature of from -30° to -40°. The products of the combustion of\r\narseniuretted hydrogen are water and arsenious acid; thus, 2H₃As + 6O =\r\n3H₂O + As₂O₃. If supplied with air in insufficient quantity, if the\r\nflame itself be cooled by (for example) a cold porcelain plate, or if\r\nthe gas pass through a tube any portion of which is heated to redness,\r\nthe gas is decomposed and the metal separated. Such a decomposition may\r\nbe compared to the deposit of carbon from ordinary flames, when made to\r\nplay upon a cooled surface. It may also be decomposed by the electric\r\nspark,[703] _e.g._, if the gas is passed slowly through a narrow tube\r\n0·7 to 0·8 mm. internal diameter, provided with wires 0·5 to 0·6 mm.\r\napart, and a small induction coil used connected with two large Bunsen’s\r\ncells, then, under these conditions, arsenic as a metal is deposited in\r\nthe neighbourhood of the sparks. For the decomposition to be complete,\r\nthe gas should not be delivered at a greater speed than from 10 to 15\r\nc.c. per minute. The gas burns with a blue-white flame, which is very\r\ncharacteristic, and was first observed by Wackenroder. It cannot,\r\nhowever, be properly seen by using the ordinary apparatus of Marsh, for\r\nthe flame is always coloured from the glass; but if the gas is made to\r\nstream through a platinum jet, and then ignited, the characters\r\nmentioned are very noteworthy.\r\n\r\n[703] N. Klobrikow, _Zeit. Anal. Chem._, xxix. 129-133.\r\n\r\nOxygen or air, and arsine, make an explosive mixture. Chlorine\r\ndecomposes the gas with great energy, combining with the hydrogen, and\r\nsetting free arsenic as a brown cloud; any excess of chlorine combines\r\nwith the arsenic as a chloride. Sulphur, submitted to arseniuretted\r\nhydrogen, forms sulphuretted hydrogen, whilst first arsenic and then\r\nsulphide of arsenic separate. Phosphorus acts in a similar way.\r\nArseniuretted and sulphuretted hydrogen may be evolved at ordinary\r\ntemperatures without decomposition; at the boiling-point of mercury\r\n(350°) they are decomposed, sulphide of arsenic and hydrogen being\r\nformed; thus, 3H₂S + 2AsH₃ = As₂S₃ + 6H₂, a reaction which is of some\r\nimportance from a practical point of view. Many metals have also the\r\nproperty of decomposing the gas at high temperatures, and setting\r\nhydrogen free. Metallic oxides, again, in like manner combine with\r\narsenic, and set water free, _e.g._, 3CuO + 2H₃As = Cu₃As₂ + 3H₂O.\r\n\r\nArsine acts on solutions of the noble metals like phosphuretted\r\nhydrogen, precipitating the metal and setting free arsenious acid; for\r\nexample, nitrate of silver is decomposed thus--\r\n\r\n  12AgNO₃ + 2H₃As + 3H₂O = As₂O₃ + 12HNO₃ + 12Ag.\r\n\r\nVitali[704] thinks the reaction is in two stages, thus:--\r\n\r\n[704] _L’Orosi_, 1892, 397-411.\r\n\r\n  (1) 2AsH₃ + 12AgNO₃ = 2(Ag₃As3AgNO₃) + 6HNO₃.\r\n\r\n  (2) 2(Ag₃As,3AgNO₃) + 6H₂O = 6HNO₃ + 6Ag₂ + 2H₃AsO₃.\r\n\r\nThis reaction admits of valuable practical application to the estimation\r\nof arsenic; for the precipitated silver is perfectly arsenic-free; the\r\nexcess of nitrate of silver is easily got rid of by a chloride of sodium\r\nsolution, and the absorption and decomposition of the gas are complete.\r\n\r\nIn cases of poisoning by arsine, the blood, when examined by the\r\nspectroscope (a process the analyst should never omit where it is\r\npossible), is of a peculiar inky colour, and the bands between D and C\r\nare melted together, and have almost vanished. Such blood, exposed to\r\noxygen remains unaltered.\r\n\r\n§ 710. =Arsine in the Arts, &c.=--In the bronzing of brass, in the\r\ndesilverising of lead by zinc, and subsequent treatment of the silver\r\nzinc with hydrochloric acid, in the tinning of sheet iron, and similar\r\nprocesses, either from the use of acids containing arsenic as an\r\nimpurity, or from the application of arsenic itself, arsine is evolved.\r\n\r\n§ 711. =Effects on Animals and Man of Breathing Arsine.=--The most\r\ngeneral effect on mammals is to produce jaundice, bloody urine, and\r\nbile. In the course of numerous experiments on dogs, Stadelmann[705]\r\nfound that by making them breathe a dose of arsine, which would not be\r\nimmediately fatal, icterus was always produced under these\r\ncircumstances, and could be always detected by the appearance of the\r\ntissues. The bile is remarkably thickened, and the theory is, that in\r\nsuch cases the jaundice is purely mechanical, the gall-duct being\r\noccluded by the inspissated bile. Rabbits experimented upon similarly\r\nshowed increased biliary secretion, but no jaundice; while it was proved\r\nthat cats are not so sensitive to arsine as either rabbits or dogs.\r\nThere are not wanting instances of arsine having been breathed by\r\nman--the discoverer of the gas, Gehlen, was in fact the first victim on\r\nrecord. In order to discover a flaw in his apparatus he smelt strongly\r\nat the joints, and died in eight days from the effects of the\r\ninhalation.\r\n\r\n[705] _Die Arsenwasserstoff-Vergiftung, Archiv f. exper. Path. u.\r\nPharm._, Leipzig, 1882.\r\n\r\nNine persons, workmen in a factory, were poisoned by arsine being\r\nevolved during the treatment by hydrochloric acid of silver-lead\r\ncontaining arsenic. Three of the nine died; their symptoms were briefly\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n(1) H. K., 22 years old; his duty was to pour hydrochloric acid on the\r\nmetal. Towards mid-day, after this operation, he complained of nausea,\r\ngiddiness, and _malaise_. In the afternoon he felt an uncommon weight of\r\nthe limbs, and an oppression in breathing. His fellow-workmen thought\r\nthat he looked yellow. On going home he lay down and passed into a\r\nnarcotic sleep. Next morning he went to his work as usual, but was not\r\ncapable of doing anything; he passed bloody urine several times\r\nthroughout the day, and fell into a deep sleep, from which he could\r\nscarcely be roused. On the third day after the accident, a physician\r\ncalled in found him in a deep sleep, with well-developed jaundice, the\r\ntemperature moderately high, pulse 100. On the fifth day the jaundice\r\ndiminished, but it was several months before he could resume his work.\r\n\r\n(2) J. T., aged 19, suffered from similar symptoms after five and a half\r\nhours’ exposure to the gas. He went home, vomited, was jaundiced, and\r\nsuffered from bloody urine; in six days became convalescent, but could\r\nnot go to work for many months.\r\n\r\n(3) C. E. was very little exposed, but was unwell for a few days.\r\n\r\n(4) L. M., 37 years old, was exposed two days to the gas; he vomited,\r\nhad bloody urine, passed into a narcotic sleep, and died in three days\r\nfrom the date of the first exposure.\r\n\r\n(5) J. S., aged 40, was exposed for two days to the gas; the symptoms\r\nwere similar to No. 4, there was suppression of urine, the catheter\r\ndrawing blood only, and death in eight days.\r\n\r\n(6) M. E., 36 years old; death in three days with similar symptoms.\r\n\r\n(7), (8), and (9) suffered like Nos. 1 and 2, and recovered after\r\nseveral months.\r\n\r\nThe chief _post-mortem_ appearance was a dirty green colour of the\r\nmucous membrane of the intestines, and congestion of the kidneys.\r\nArsenic was detected in all parts of the body.[706]\r\n\r\n[706] Trost, _Vergiftung durch Arsenwasserstoff bei der technischen\r\nGewinnung des Silbers, Vierteljahrsschrift f. gericht. Med._, xviii.\r\nBd., 2 Heft, S. 6, 1873.\r\n\r\nTwo cases are detailed by Dr. Valette in Tardieu’s _Étude_.[707] A\r\nmistake occurred in a laboratory, by which a solution of arsenic\r\n(instead of sulphuric acid) was poured on zinc to develop hydrogen. Of\r\nthe two sufferers, the one recovered after an illness of about a week or\r\nten days, the other died at the end of twenty-eight days. The main\r\nsymptoms were yellowness of skin, vomiting, bloody urine, great\r\ndepression, slight diarrhœa, headache, and in the fatal case a\r\nmorbiliform eruption. In a case recorded in the _British Medical\r\nJournal_, November 4, 1876, there were none of the usual symptoms of\r\ngastric irritation, but loss of memory of recent acts, drowsiness, and\r\ngiddiness.\r\n\r\n[707] Ambroise Tardieu, _Étude Médico-légale sur l’Empoisonnement_, Obs.\r\nxxv. p. 449.\r\n\r\n§ 712. =The Sulphides of Arsenic.=--Of the sulphides of arsenic, two\r\nonly, realgar and orpiment, are of any practical importance. _Realgar_,\r\nAs₂S₂ = 214; specific gravity, 3·356; composition in 100 parts, As\r\n70·01, S 29·91; average composition of commercial product, As 75, S 25.\r\nRealgar is found native in ruby-red crystals, and is also prepared\r\nartificially by heating together 9 parts of arsenic and 4 of sulphur, or\r\n198 parts of arsenious anhydride with 112 parts of sulphur, 2As₂O₃ + 7S\r\n= 2As₂S₂ + 3SO₂. It is insoluble in water and in hydrochloric acid, but\r\nis readily dissolved by potassic disulphide, by nitric acid, and by\r\naqua regia. It is decomposed by caustic potash, leaving undissolved a\r\nbrown sediment (As₁₂S), which contains 96·5 per cent. of arsenic. The\r\ndissolved portion is readily converted into arsine by aluminium.\r\n\r\n§ 713. =Orpiment, or Arsenic Trisulphide.=--As₂S₃ = 246; specific\r\ngravity, 3·48; composition in 100 parts, As 60·98, S 39·02; found native\r\nin crystals, presents itself in the laboratory usually as a brilliant\r\nyellow amorphous powder, on passing sulphuretted hydrogen through an\r\nacid solution of arsenious acid or an arsenite. It is very insoluble in\r\nwater (about one in a million, _Fresenius_), scarcely soluble in boiling\r\nconcentrated hydrochloric acid, and insoluble generally in dilute acids.\r\nRed fuming nitric acid dissolves it, converting it into arsenic and\r\nsulphuric acids; ammonia and other alkaline sulphides, the alkalies\r\nthemselves, alkaline carbonates, bisulphide of potassium, and aqua\r\nregia, all dissolve it readily. In the arts it is used as King’s yellow\r\n(see p. 532). Tanners also formerly employed a mixture of 90 parts of\r\norpiment and 10 of quicklime, under the name of _Rusma_, as a\r\ndepilatory; but the alkaline sulphides from gas-works are replacing this\r\nto a great extent.\r\n\r\n§ 714. =Haloid Arsenical Compounds.--The Chloride of Arsenic=, AsCl₃ =\r\n181·5; specific gravity liquid, 0° 2·205; boiling-point 134° (273·2°F.),\r\nis a heavy, colourless, oily liquid, which has been used as an\r\nescharotic in cancerous affections (principally by quacks). In one\r\nprocess of detecting and estimating arsenic, the properties of this\r\nsubstance are utilised (see p. 575). It is immediately decomposed by\r\nwater into arsenious and hydrochloric acids.\r\n\r\n=The Iodide of Arsenic= (AsI₃) is used occasionally in skin diseases,\r\nbut is of little interest to the analyst; it is commonly seen in the\r\nform of brick-red brilliant flakes.\r\n\r\n§ 715. =Arsenic in the Arts.=--The metal is used in various alloys; for\r\nexample, speculum metal is made of tin, copper, and a little arsenic;\r\nwhite copper is an alloy of copper and arsenic; shot is composed of 1000\r\nparts of lead mixed with 3 of arsenic; the common Britannia metal used\r\nfor tea-pots, spoons, &c., often contains arsenic; and brass is bronzed\r\nwith a thin film of arsenic. It was formerly much employed in the\r\nmanufacture of glass, but is being gradually superseded. It is also now\r\nused to some extent in the reduction of indigo blue, and in that of\r\nnitro-benzole in the manufacture of aniline.\r\n\r\nIn cases of suspected poisoning, therefore, and the finding of arsenic\r\nin the stomach, or elsewhere, it may be set up as a defence that the\r\narsenic was derived from shot used in the cleansing of bottles, from the\r\nbottles themselves, or from metal vessels, such as tea-pots, &c.\r\n\r\nThe arsenic in all these alloys being extremely insoluble, any solution\r\nto a poisonous extent is in the highest degree improbable. It may,\r\nhowever, be necessary to treat the vessels with the fluid or fluids\r\nwhich have been supposed to exert this prejudicial action, and test\r\nthem for arsenic. The treatment should, of course, be of a severe and\r\nexhaustive character, and the fluids should be allowed to stand cold in\r\nthe vessels for twenty-four hours; then the effect of a gentle heat\r\nshould be studied, and, lastly, that of boiling temperatures. The\r\nanalysis of the alloy itself, or of the glass, it would seldom be of\r\nvalue to undertake, for the crushed and finely divided substance is in a\r\ncondition very different from that of the article when entire, and\r\ninferences drawn from such analytical data would be fallacious.\r\n\r\nArsenious anhydride is also used for the preservation of wood, and is\r\nthrown occasionally into the holds of vessels in large quantities to\r\nprevent vegetable decomposition. In India, again, a solution of arsenic\r\nis applied to the walls as a wash, in order to prevent the attacks of\r\ninsects.\r\n\r\n§ 716. =Pharmaceutical, Non-officinal, and other Preparations of\r\nArsenic.=--(1) =Pharmaceutical Preparations.=--The Liquor arsenicalis\r\n(Fowler’s solution), or solution of arsenic of the pharmacopœia, is\r\ncomposed of:--\r\n\r\n  Carbonate of Potash,              87 grains  (5·64 grms.)\r\n  Arsenious Acid,                   87   „     (5·64   „  )\r\n  Compound Tincture of Lavender,     5 drachms (17·72 c.c.)\r\n\r\ndissolved in 1 pint (567·9 c.c.) of water; every ounce, therefore,\r\ncontains 4·3 grains of arsenious acid (or 100 c.c. = ·9As₂O₃); the\r\nstrength is therefore nearly 1 per cent.\r\n\r\n=Liquor Ammonii Arsenitis= (not officinal) is made of the same strength,\r\nammonium carbonate being substituted for potassic carbonate.\r\n\r\nThe _hydrochloric solution of arsenic_ is simply arsenious acid\r\ndissolved in hydrochloric acid; its strength should be exactly the same\r\nas that of Fowler’s solution.\r\n\r\nA solution of _arseniate of soda_[708] contains the _anhydrous_ salt in\r\nthe proportion of 4 grains to the ounce (·9 in 100 c.c.) of water.\r\n\r\n[708] The formula for arseniate of soda is Na₂HAsO₄7H₂O, but it\r\nsometimes contains more water.\r\n\r\n=Liquor Arsenii et Hydrargyri Iodidi= (Donovan’s Solution of\r\nArsenic).--This is not officinal, but is used to some extent in skin\r\ndiseases; it is a solution of the iodides of mercury and arsenic;\r\nstrength about 1 per cent. of each of the iodides.\r\n\r\n=Arseniate of Iron=, Fe₃As₂O₈, is an amorphous green powder, used to\r\nsome extent in medicine. It should contain 33·6 per cent. of metallic\r\narsenic.\r\n\r\n=Clemen’s Solution.=--A solution of the bromide and arseniate of\r\npotassium; strength equal to 1 per cent. arsenious acid. Officinal in\r\nU.S., France, and Norway.\r\n\r\n=Pilula Asiatica= (not officinal) is composed of arsenious acid, extract\r\nof gentian, and black pepper. There is 1/12th of a grain (5·4\r\nmilligrams) of arsenious acid in each pill.\r\n\r\n=Dr. De Valanguis’ Solutio solventes mineralis= is composed of 30 grains\r\nof As₂O₃ dissolved by 90 minims of HCl in 20 oz. of water; strength =\r\n0·034 per cent. As₂O₃.\r\n\r\n(2) =Veterinary Arsenical Medicine.=--Common veterinary preparations\r\ncontaining arsenic are:--A ball for worms, containing in parts--\r\n\r\n  Calomel,                   1·3 per cent.\r\n  Arsenious Acid,            1·3    „\r\n  Tin Filings,              77·9    „\r\n  Venice Turpentine,[709]   19·5    „\r\n\r\n[709] The Venice turpentine is rarely found in ordinary commerce, what\r\nis sold under that name consisting of black resin and oil of turpentine.\r\n\r\nA common tonic ball:[710]--\r\n\r\n[710] A similar preparation in common use has the addition of sulphate\r\nof zinc.\r\n\r\n  Arsenious Acid,        5 to 10 grains (·324 to ·648 grm.)\r\n  Aniseed,                 ½ oz.

A dark grey\r\npowder, which used to be sold under the name of fly-powder, consisted of\r\nmetallic arsenic that had been exposed some time to the air.\r\n\r\n=Fly-water= is a strong solution of arsenious acid of uncertain\r\nstrength, sweetened with sugar, treacle, or honey. Another fly-poison\r\nconsists of a mixture of arsenious acid, tersulphide of arsenic,\r\ntreacle, and honey.\r\n\r\n(4) =Quack and other Nostrums.=--The analyst may meet with several quack\r\npreparations for external use in cancer. A celebrated arsenical paste\r\nfor this purpose is composed of:--\r\n\r\n  Arsenious Acid,              8 per cent.\r\n  Cinnabar,                   70    „\r\n  Dragon’s Blood,             22    „\r\n\r\n=Frères Come’s Cancer Paste= is composed of arsenious acid, 1; charcoal,\r\n1; red mercury sulphide, 4; water, q. s.\r\n\r\nThe tasteless “_ague drops_” used in the fen countries are simply a\r\nsolution of arsenite of potash.\r\n\r\n=Davidson’s Cancer Remedy= consists, according to Dr. Paris, of equal\r\nparts of arsenious acid and powdered hemlock.\r\n\r\nIn India, arsenic given as a medicine by native practitioners, or\r\nadministered as a poison, may be found coloured and impure, from having\r\nbeen mixed either with cow’s urine, or with the juice of leaves,\r\n&c.[712]\r\n\r\n[712] Chevers, _Med. Jurisprudence for India_, p. 116.\r\n\r\nArsenious acid is used by dentists to destroy the nervous pulp of\r\ndecayed and painful teeth, about the twenty-fifth of a grain (2·5\r\nmgrms.) being placed in the cavity. A common formula is arsenious acid,\r\n2; sulphate of morphine, 1; creasote, q. s. to make a stiff paste. There\r\nis no record of any accident having resulted from this practice\r\nhitherto; but since the dentist seldom weighs the arsenic, it is not\r\naltogether free from danger.\r\n\r\n(5) =Pigments, &c.=--_King’s yellow_ should be As₂S₃, the trisulphide of\r\narsenic or orpiment. It is frequently adulterated with 80 to 90 per\r\ncent. of arsenious acid, and in such a case is, of course, more\r\npoisonous. King’s yellow, if pure, yields to water nothing which gives\r\nany arsenical reaction.\r\n\r\nA blue pigment, termed _mineral blue_, consists of about equal parts of\r\narsenite of copper and potash, and should contain 38·7 per cent. of\r\nmetallic arsenic (= to 51·084 As₂O₃H) and 15·6 of copper.\r\n\r\n=Schweinfurt green= (Syn. _Emerald-green_), (CuAs₂O₄)₃Cu(C₂H₃O₂)₂ is a\r\ncupric arsenite and acetate, and should contain 25 per cent. of copper\r\nand 58·4 per cent. of arsenious acid. In analysis, the copper in this\r\ncompound is readily separated from the arsenic by first oxidising with\r\nnitric acid, and then adding to the nitric acid solution ammonia, until\r\nthe blue colour remains undissolved. At this point ammonium oxalate is\r\nadded in excess, the solution is first acidified by hydrochloric or\r\nnitric acid, and, on standing, the copper separates completely (or\r\nalmost so) as Oxalate, the arsenic remaining in solution.\r\n\r\nAnother method is to pass SH₂ to saturation, collect the sulphides on a\r\nfilter, and, after washing and drying the mixed sulphides, oxidise with\r\nfuming nitric acid, evaporate to dryness, and again treat with nitric\r\nacid. The residue is fused with soda and potassic nitrate, the fused\r\nmass is dissolved in water, acidulated with nitric acid, and the copper\r\nis precipitated by potash; the solution is filtered, and in the filtrate\r\nthe arsenic is precipitated as ammonio-magnesian arseniate or as\r\ntrisulphide.[713]\r\n\r\n[713] P. Gucci, _Chem. Centrbl._, 1887, 1528.\r\n\r\n=Scheele’s green= (CuHAsO₃) is a hydrocupric arsenite, and contains 52·8\r\nper cent. of arsenious anhydride and 33·8 per cent. of copper.\r\n\r\n(6) =External Application of Arsenic for Sheep, &c.=--Many of these are\r\nsimply solutions of arsenic, the solution being made by the farmer. Most\r\nof the yellow sheep-dipping compounds of commerce are made up either of\r\nimpure carbonate of potash, or of soda ash, arsenic, soft soap, and\r\nsulphur. The French _bain de Tessier_ is composed of:--\r\n\r\n  Arsenious Acid,        1·00 kgrm.\r\n  Ferrous Sulphate,     10·00  „\r\n  Peroxide of Iron,      0·40  „\r\n  Gentian Powder,        0·20  „\r\n\r\nThis is to be added to 100 kgrms. of water. Another common application\r\nconsists of alum and arsenic (10 or 12 to 1), dissolved in two or three\r\nhundred parts of water.\r\n\r\n(7) =Arsenical Soaps, &c.=--Arsenic is used in preserving the skins of\r\nanimals. One of the compounds for this purpose, known under the name of\r\n_Bécoeur’s arsenical soap_, has the following composition:--\r\n\r\n  Camphor,                 3·4 per cent.\r\n  Arsenic,                20·2    „\r\n  Carbonate of Potash,    56·2    „\r\n  Lime,[714]              20·2    „\r\n\r\n[714] The dust from the preserved skins of animals has caused, at least,\r\none case of poisoning. _Ann. d’Hyg.

These particulars are to be signed\r\nalso by the purchaser. No person (sec. 2) is allowed to sell arsenic to\r\nany one unknown to the seller, unless in the presence of a witness whom\r\nthe seller is acquainted with. The arsenic sold (sec. 3) is to be mixed\r\nwith soot or indigo in the proportion of half an ounce of indigo to a\r\npound of arsenic. It, therefore, follows that the coloured substance\r\nshould not contain more than 70 per cent. of arsenious acid. The Act\r\napplies to all the colourless preparations of arsenic: but it is not to\r\naffect chemists in making up prescriptions for medical men, or in\r\nsupplying medical men; nor is it to affect the wholesale dealers in\r\nsupplying arsenic to retail shops, &c. The penalty for conviction is\r\n£20, or less.[715]\r\n\r\n[715] Commercial arsenic is often much adulterated, especially with\r\ngypsum, chalk, &c. These are most readily detected by subliming the\r\narsenic. The sublimed arsenic itself may not be entirely pure, sometimes\r\ncontaining arsenical sulphides and antimonious oxide.\r\n\r\n§ 719. =Dose.=--The smallest dose of arsenic known to have proved fatal\r\nto a human being is ·16 grm. (2½ grains). Farriers and grooms are in the\r\nhabit of giving as much as l·3 grm. (20 grains) a day to a horse, so\r\nthat the poisonous dose for this animal must be very large.\r\n\r\nThe maximum dose for the horned cattle appears to be from ·32 to ·38\r\ngrm. (5 to 6 grains); that for a dog is 16 mgrms. (¼ grain), and even\r\nthis may, in the smaller kinds, cause illness.\r\n\r\nThe following may be considered as _dangerous doses_ of arsenic:--·13\r\ngrm. (2 grains) for an adult; 1·9 grm. (30 grains) for a horse; ·64 grm.\r\n(10 grains) for a cow; and 32 to 64 mgrms. (½ to 1 grain) for a dog.\r\n\r\n§ 720. =Effects of Arsenious Acid on Plants.=--If the root or stem of a\r\nplant is immersed in a solution of arsenious acid, the hue of the leaves\r\nsoon alters in appearance, the green colour becomes of a whitish or\r\nbrownish hue, and the plant withers; the effect being very similar to\r\nthat produced by hot water. The toxic action may be traced from below\r\nupwards, and analysis will detect minute quantities of arsenic in all\r\nportions of the plant.\r\n\r\nIt has, however, been shown by Gorup-Besanez,[716] that if arsenious\r\nacid be mixed with earth, and plants grown in such earth, they only take\r\nup infinitesimal quantities of arsenic. Hence, in cases of cattle\r\npoisoning, any defence based upon the alleged presence of arsenic in the\r\npasture will be more ingenious than just.\r\n\r\n[716] _Annal. d. Chemie u. Pharmacie_, Bd. cxxvii., H. 2, 243.\r\n\r\nThe influence of arsenical fumes as evolved from manufactories upon\r\nshrubs and trees is in general insignificant. Pines and firs, five to\r\nsix years old, have been known to suffer from a disease in which there\r\nis a shedding of the leaves, the more tender herbage being at the same\r\ntime affected. Whatever dangers the practice of steeping corn intended\r\nfor seed in a solution of arsenious acid, as a preventive of “smut,” may\r\npossess, it does not appear to influence deleteriously the growth of the\r\nfuture plant.\r\n\r\nSuperphosphate of manure is frequently rich in arsenic. Dr. Edmund Davy\r\nasserts that plants to which such manure is applied take up arsenic in\r\ntheir tissues, and M. Andonard has made a similar statement. Tuson[717]\r\nhas also undertaken some experiments, which confirm Andonard and Davy’s\r\nresearches. The bearing of this with relation to the detection of\r\narsenic in the stomachs of the herbivora needs no comment.\r\n\r\n[717] Cooley’s _Dictionary_, Art. “Arsenic.”\r\n\r\n§ 721. =Effects on Animal Life--Animalcules.=--All infusoria and forms\r\nof animalcule-life hitherto observed perish rapidly if a minute quantity\r\nof arsenious acid is dissolved in the water in which they exist.\r\n\r\n=Insects.=--The common arsenical fly-papers afford numerous\r\nopportunities for observing the action of arsenic on ordinary flies;\r\nwithin a few minutes (five to ten after taking the poison into their\r\ndigestive organs) they fall, apparently from paralysis of the wings, and\r\ndie. Spiders and all insects into which the poison has been introduced\r\nexhibit a similar sudden death. It is said that in the neighbourhood of\r\narsenical manufactories there is much destruction among bees and other\r\nforms of insect life.\r\n\r\n=Annelids.=--If arsenious acid is applied to the external surface of\r\nworms or leeches, the part which it touches perishes first, and life is\r\nextinguished successively in the others. If a wound is made first, and\r\nthe arsenious acid then applied to it, the effects are only intensified\r\nand hastened. There is always noticed an augmentation of the excretions;\r\nthe vermicular movements are at first made more lively, they then become\r\nlanguid, and death is very gradual.\r\n\r\n=Birds.=--The symptoms with birds are somewhat different, and vary\r\naccording to the form in which the poison is administered, viz., whether\r\nas a vapour or in solution. In several experiments made by Eulenberg on\r\npigeons, the birds were secured under glass shades, and exposed to the\r\nvapour of metallic arsenic vaporised by heat. It is scarcely necessary\r\nto remark that in operating in this way, the poisoning was not by\r\nmetallic arsenic vapour, but by that of arsenious acid. One of these\r\nexperiments may be cited:--A pigeon was made to breathe an atmosphere\r\ncharged with vapour from the volatilisation of metallic arsenic. The\r\nbird was immediately restless; in thirty minutes it vomited repeatedly,\r\nand the nasal apertures were noticed to be moist; after a little while,\r\nthe bird, still breathing the arsenious acid atmosphere, was much\r\ndistressed, shook its head repeatedly, and yawned; in fifty minutes the\r\nrespiration was laboured, and in fifty-nine minutes there was much\r\nvomiting. On removing the bird, after it had been exposed an hour to the\r\nvapour (·16 grm. of metallic arsenic having been evaporated in all), it\r\nrapidly recovered.\r\n\r\nSix days after, the pigeon was again exposed in the same way to the\r\nvapour, but this time ·56 grm. of metallic arsenic was volatilised. In\r\nfifteen minutes there was retching, followed by vomiting. On taking it\r\nout after an hour it remained very quiet, ate nothing, and often puffed\r\nitself out; the breathing was normal, movements free, but it had unusual\r\nthirst. On the second and third day the excretions were frequent and\r\nfluid; the cardiac pulsations were slowed, and the bird was disinclined\r\nto move. On the fourth day it continued in one place, puffing itself\r\nout; towards evening the respirations slowed, the beak gaping at every\r\ninspiration. On attempting flight, the wings fluttered and the bird fell\r\non its head. After this it lay on its side, with slow, laboured\r\nrespiration, the heart-beats scarcely to be felt, and death took place\r\nwithout convulsions, and very quietly. On examining the organs after\r\ndeath, the brain and spinal cord were very bloodless; there were\r\necchymoses in the lungs; but little else characteristic. The experiment\r\nquoted has a direct bearing upon the breathing of arsenical dust; as,\r\nfor example, that which floats in the air of a room papered with an\r\neasily detached arsenical pigment. Other experiments on birds generally\r\nhave shown that the symptoms produced by arsenious acid in solution, or\r\nin the solid form, in a dose insufficient to destroy life, are languor,\r\nloss of appetite, and the voidance of large quantities of liquid excreta\r\nlike verdigris. With fatal doses, the bird remains quiet; there are\r\nfluid, sometimes bloody, excretions; spasmodic movements of the pharynx,\r\nanti-peristaltic contraction of the œsophagus, vomiting, general\r\ntrembling of the body, thirst, erection of the feathers, and laboured\r\nrespiration. The bird becomes very feeble, and the scene mostly closes\r\nwith insensibility and convulsions.\r\n\r\n=Mammals=, such as cats, dogs, &c., suffer from symptoms fairly\r\nidentical with those observed in man; but the nervous symptoms\r\n(according to P. Hugo) do not predominate, while with rabbits and\r\nguinea-pigs, nervous symptoms are more marked and constant.[718] There\r\nare vomiting, purging, and often convulsions and paralysis before death.\r\nIt has been noticed that the muscles after death are in a great state of\r\ncontraction. The slow poisoning of a dog, according to Lolliot,[719]\r\nproduced an erythematous eruption in the vicinity of the joints, ears,\r\nand other parts of the body; there were conjunctivitis, increased\r\nlachrymal secretion, and photophobia; the hair fell off.\r\n\r\n[718] _Archiv f. exper. Path. u. Pharmakol_, Leipzig, 1882.\r\n\r\n[719] _Étude Physiol. d’Arsène_, Thèse, Paris, 1868.\r\n\r\n§ 722. =Effects of Arsenious Acid on Man.=--The symptoms produced by\r\narsenious acid vary according to the form of the poison--whether solid,\r\nvaporous, or soluble--according to the condition of bodily health of the\r\nperson taking it, and according to the manner in which it is introduced\r\ninto the animal economy, while they are also in no small degree modified\r\nby individual peculiarities of organisation and by habit, as, for\r\ninstance, in the arsenic-eaters.\r\n\r\n=Arsenic-Eaters.=--In all European countries grooms and horse-dealers\r\nare acquainted with the fact that a little arsenic given daily in the\r\ncorn improves the coat, increases, probably, the assimilation of the\r\nfood, and renders the horse plump and fat. On the Continent grooms have\r\nbeen known to put a piece of arsenic, the size of a pea, in a little\r\noatmeal, make it into a ball, tie it up in a linen rag, and attach it to\r\nthe bit; the saliva dissolves, little by little, the poison, while both\r\nthe gentle irritation and physiological action excite a certain amount\r\nof salivation, and the white foam at the mouth, and the champing of the\r\nhorse, are thought vastly to improve the appearance. Shot, which\r\ncontains a small quantity of arsenic, have been used for the same\r\npurpose, and from half a pound to a pound of small shot has been given\r\nto horses. When a horse has been for a long time dosed with arsenic, it\r\nseems necessary to continue the practice; if this is not done, the\r\nanimal rapidly loses his condition. The explanation probably is, that\r\nthe arsenic stimulates the various cells and glands of the intestinal\r\ntract to a superaction, the natural termination of which is an\r\nenfeeblement of their secreting power--this especially in the absence of\r\nthe stimulus. Turning from equine involuntary arsenic-eaters, we find\r\nthe strange custom of arsenic-eating voluntarily pursued by the races of\r\nlower Austria and Styria, especially by those dwelling on the mountains\r\nseparating Styria from Hungary. In India also (and especially in the\r\nPunjaub) the same practice prevails, and here it is often taken as an\r\naphrodisiac. The mountaineers imagine that it increases the respiratory\r\npower, nor is there wanting some evidence to show that this is actually\r\nthe fact, and medicinal doses of arsenic have been in use for some time\r\nin cases of asthma and other diseases of the chest. The arsenic-eaters\r\nbegin with a very small dose, which is continued for several weeks or\r\nmonths, until the system gets accustomed to it. The amount is then\r\nslightly augmented until relatively large doses are taken with impunity.\r\nIn one case[720] it appears that a countryman, in good health, and sixty\r\nyears of age, took daily 4 grains of arsenious acid, a habit which he\r\nhad inherited from his father, and which he in turn bequeathed to his\r\nson.\r\n\r\n[720] Tardieu, _op. cit._\r\n\r\nThe existence of such a custom as arsenic-eating, in its literal sense,\r\nhas more than once been doubted, but all who have travelled over Styria\r\nand other places where the habit prevails have convinced themselves that\r\nthe facts have not been overstated. For example, Dr. Maclagan, in\r\ncompany with Dr. J. T. Rutter,[721] visited Styria in 1865, and having\r\ncarefully weighed 5 or 6 grains of arsenic, saw these doses actually\r\nswallowed by two men. On collecting their urine, about two hours\r\nafterwards, abundant quantitative evidence of its presence was found;\r\nbut in neither of the men were there the slightest symptoms of\r\npoisoning. It is obvious that the existence of such a habit might\r\nseriously complicate any inquiry into arsenical poisoning in these\r\nregions.\r\n\r\n[721] _Edin. Med. Journ._, April 1865; _Brit. and For. Med. Chir.\r\nJourn._, Oct. 1865.\r\n\r\n§ 723. =Manner of Introduction of Arsenic.=--Arsenious acid exerts a\r\npoisonous action, whether it is taken by the stomach, or introduced into\r\nthe system by any other channel whatever. The differences in the\r\nsymptoms produced by external application (as through a wound), and by\r\nswallowing arsenious acid in substance or in solution, are not so marked\r\nas might be expected. It was probably Hunter who first distinctly\r\nrecognised the fact that arsenic, even when introduced outwardly by\r\napplication to an abraded surface, exerts a specific effect on the\r\nmucous membrane of the stomach. Brodie[722] states, “Mr. Home informed\r\nme that in an experiment made by Mr. Hunter himself, in which arsenic\r\nwas applied to a wound in a dog, the animal died in twenty-four hours,\r\nand the stomach was found to be considerably inflamed. I repeated this\r\nexperiment several times, taking the precaution of always applying a\r\nbandage to prevent the animal licking the wound. The result was that the\r\ninflammation of the stomach was commonly more violent and more immediate\r\nthan when the poison was administered internally, and that it preceded\r\nin appearance the inflammation of the wound.”\r\n\r\n[722] _Phil. Trans._, 1812.\r\n\r\n§ 724. =Cases of Poisoning by the External Application of Arsenic.=--A\r\nmass-poisoning by the external use of arsenical violet powder to infants\r\noccurred in England some years ago. Two deaths from this cause were\r\nestablished by coroners’ inquests.[723] Dr. Tidy found the violet\r\npowders used in the two cases to have the following composition:--\r\n\r\n[723] “Gleanings in Toxicology,” by C. Meymott Tidy, M.B.--_Lancet_,\r\nAug. 21, 1878.\r\n\r\n                             1.         2.\r\n                          Per cent.

(6·5 grains) of arsenious acid was\r\nseparated in the one case, and ·194 grm. (3 grains) in the other. In\r\nthese cases arose the question which is sure to recur in legal inquiries\r\ninto poisoning by absorption, viz., whether the poison lying on the\r\nsurface and folds of the skin could not have been mixed during the\r\n_post-mortem_ examination with the organs of the body? In these\r\nparticular cases special care appears to have been taken, and the answer\r\nwas satisfactory. It is not amiss, however, to call attention to the\r\nextreme precaution which such instances necessitate.\r\n\r\nA woman, aged 51, had used a solution of arsenious acid to cure the\r\nitch; erysipelas of the body, however, followed, and she died after a\r\nlong illness--one of the symptoms noted being trembling and paresis of\r\nthe limbs.[725] In a case recorded by Desgranges,[726] a young\r\nchambermaid had applied to the unwounded scalp an arsenical ointment for\r\nthe purpose of destroying vermin. She also suffered from a severe\r\nerysipelas, and the hair fell off. Quacks have frequently applied\r\nvarious arsenical pastes to ulcers and cancerous breasts with a fatal\r\nresult. Instances of this abound; in one, a charlatan applied to a\r\nchronic ulcer of the leg an arsenical caustic; the patient showed\r\nsymptoms of violent poisoning, and died on the sixth day.[727] In\r\nanother, a lady suffering from some form of tumour of the breast,\r\napplied to an unqualified practitioner, who made from fifteen to twenty\r\npunctures with a lancet in the swelling, covered a piece of bread with\r\nan arsenical compound, and applied the bread thus prepared to the\r\nbreast. Twelve hours afterwards symptoms of violent gastric irritation\r\ncommenced; and vomiting and a sanguinolent diarrhœa followed, with death\r\non the fifth day. Arsenic was found in all the organs.[728] Such\r\nexamples might be multiplied. Arsenic has been in more than one case\r\nintroduced criminally into the vagina with a fatal result.[729] Foderé,\r\n_e.g._, has recorded the case of a maid-servant who poisoned her\r\nmistress by intentionally administering several arsenical enemata.[730]\r\nArsenious acid again has been respired in the form of vapour. One of the\r\nbest instances of this is recorded by Taylor, and was the subject of a\r\ntrial at the York Lent Assizes, 1864. The prisoner placed some burning\r\npyrites at the doorway of a small room, in which there were eight\r\nchildren, including an infant in the cradle. The other children were\r\nremoved speedily, but the infant was exposed to the vapour for an hour;\r\nit suffered from vomiting and diarrhœa, and died in twenty-four hours.\r\nThere was slight inflammation of the stomach and intestines, the brain\r\nand lungs were congested, and the lining membrane of the trachea of a\r\nbright red colour. Arsenic was detected in the stomach, in the lungs,\r\nand spleen. The pyrites contained arsenic, and the fatal fumes were in\r\neffect composed of sulphurous and arsenious acids.\r\n\r\n[725] Belloc, _Méd.

Légale_, iv.\r\n\r\n§ 725. =Arsenic in Wall-Papers.=--It is now an accepted fact that\r\narsenical colours on wall-papers cause illness. The symptoms are those\r\nof chronic poisoning, and present nothing distinctive from the effects\r\nproduced from small doses of arsenic.\r\n\r\nKirschgasser[731] has described the symptoms in detail of twenty-six\r\ncases. That arsenic is actually present in patients suffering is often\r\nsusceptible of proof, by examining skilfully and carefully a\r\nconsiderable volume (from one to two days’ collection) of the urine; in\r\nmost of the cases thus examined arsenic has been discovered. This\r\npoisoning is produced, sometimes from the dust, at others from a\r\nvolatile compound of arsenic, which has the following properties:--It is\r\nvery volatile (perhaps a gas), it has a strong alliaceous odour, it is\r\nnot entirely decomposed by a solution of silver nitrate, but is\r\napparently decomposed by a boiling acid solution of potassic\r\npermanganate. The author suggests that it may be a compound of CO and\r\nAs, but this is only a supposition. The existence of this volatile\r\nsubstance has been settled beyond all question by the experiments of\r\nGosio,[732] confirmed by those of Charles Robert Sanger.[733]\r\n\r\n[731] _Vierteljahr. f. gericht Med._, N.

One mould, the _Penicillium brevicaule_, has\r\nquite a special endowment in forming this peculiar arsenical compound;\r\nso much so, that Gosio has proposed its use as a reagent for arsenic,\r\nthe garlic odour being perceived when the fungus is made to grow in\r\nsolutions containing organic matter and only traces of arsenic.\r\n\r\n§ 726. =Forms of Arsenical Poisoning.=--There are at least four distinct\r\nforms of arsenical poisoning, viz., an acute, subacute, a nervous, and a\r\nchronic form.\r\n\r\n=Acute Form.=--All those cases in which the inflammatory symptoms are\r\nsevere from the commencement, and in which the sufferer dies within\r\ntwenty-four hours, may be called acute. The commencement of the symptoms\r\nin these cases is always within the hour; they have been known, indeed,\r\nto occur within eight minutes, but the most usual time is from twenty\r\nminutes to half an hour. There is an acrid feeling in the throat, with\r\nnausea; vomiting soon sets in, the ejected matters being at first\r\ncomposed of the substances eaten; later they may be bilious or even\r\nbloody, or composed of a whitish liquid. Diarrhœa follows and\r\naccompanies the vomiting, the motions are sometimes like those met with\r\nin ordinary diarrhœa and English cholera, and sometimes bloody. There is\r\ncoldness of the extremities, with great feebleness, and the pulse is\r\nsmall and difficult to feel. The face, at first very pale, takes a\r\nbluish tint, the temperature falls still lower; the patient sinks in\r\ncollapse, and death takes place in from five to twenty hours after the\r\ntaking of the poison.\r\n\r\nThere can scarcely be said to be any clinical feature which\r\ndistinguishes the above description from that of cholera; and supposing\r\nthat cholera were epidemic, and no suspicious circumstance apparently\r\npresent, there can be little doubt that a most experienced physician\r\nmight mistake the cause of the malady, unless surrounding circumstances\r\ngive some hint or clue to it. In the acute form diarrhœa may be absent,\r\nand the patient die, as it were, from “shock.” This was probably the\r\ncause of death in a case related by Casper,[734] that of Julius Bolle,\r\npoisoned by his wife. He took an unknown quantity of arsenic in\r\nsolution at seven in the morning, and in about three-quarters of an hour\r\nafterwards suffered from pain and vomiting, and died in little more than\r\nthree hours. There were no signs of inflammation in the stomach and\r\nintestines, but from the contents of the stomach were separated ·0132\r\ngrm. of arsenious acid, and ·00513 grm. from pieces of the liver,\r\nspleen, kidneys, lung, and blood. The dose actually taken is supposed\r\nnot to have been less than ·388 grm. (6 grains).\r\n\r\n[734] Case 188 in Casper’s _Handbuch_.\r\n\r\n§ 727. =The Subacute Form.=--The subacute form is that which is most\r\ncommon; it exhibits some variety of phenomena, and individual cases vary\r\nmuch in the matter of time. The commencement of symptoms is, as in the\r\nmost acute form, usually within the hour, but exceptions to this rule\r\noccur. In a case quoted by Taylor,[735] and recorded by M. Tonnelier,\r\nthe poison did not cause any marked illness for eight hours; it was\r\nfound, on _post-mortem_ examination, that a cyst had been formed in the\r\nstomach which sheathed the arsenic over, and in some degree explained\r\nthis delay. In another case, again, ten hours elapsed, and this is\r\nconsidered to be the maximum period yet observed. As with the acute\r\nform, there is a feeling of nausea, followed by vomiting, which\r\ncontinues although the stomach is quite empty; at first the ejected\r\nmatter is a watery fluid, but later it may be streaked with blood. The\r\ntongue is thickly coated; there is great thirst, but the drinking of any\r\nliquid (even of ice-cold water) increases the vomiting. Nearly always\r\npain is felt in the epigastrium, spreading all over the abdomen, and\r\nextending to the loin (which is tense and tender on pressure).\r\nDeglutition is often painful, and is accompanied by a sort of spasmodic\r\nconstriction of the pharyngeal muscles. Diarrhœa follows the vomiting,\r\nand has the same characters as that previously described; occasionally,\r\nhowever, this feature is absent. In the case recorded by Martineau,[736]\r\na man, aged 25, was seized at 10 A.M. suddenly with vomiting, which\r\npersisted all that day and the next, during which time the bowels were\r\nobstinately confined. On the second day a purgative was administered,\r\nwhereupon diarrhœa set in, and continued until his death, which occurred\r\nin about two days and sixteen hours from the commencement of the\r\nsymptoms. This case is also remarkable from the absence of pain or\r\ntenderness of the abdomen.\r\n\r\n[735] Taylor’s _Principles and Practice of Jurisprudence_, vol. i. p.\r\n251; Flandin, vol. i. p. 535.\r\n\r\n[736] Tardieu, _op. cit._, Obs. xix.\r\n\r\nIn subacute cases the urine has several times been suppressed, and it is\r\ngenerally scanty and red in colour. Irregularity of the heart’s action\r\nand feebleness are tolerably constant phenomena. As the end approaches,\r\nthere is excessive muscular weakness, the face is pale, the eyes hollow;\r\nthe mucous membranes first, and then the skin, take a bluish tint; the\r\nskin itself is covered with perspiration, and there has been noticed a\r\npeculiar odour, which has been likened to arsine (arseniuretted\r\nhydrogen). The respiration is troubled, convulsive movements of the\r\nlimbs have been observed, and cramps in the calves of the legs; death\r\nfollows in a variable time--from twenty-four hours to several days. In\r\ncertain cases there is a curious remission after violent symptoms, the\r\npatient rallies and seems to have recovered; but the appearance is\r\ndeceptive, for the symptoms recur, and death follows. Recovery may also\r\ntake place partially from the primary effects, and then inflammatory\r\nchanges in the stomach, &c., set in, with fever and the ordinary\r\nsymptoms which are common in all internal inflammation.\r\n\r\nA single dose of arsenious acid may cause a prolonged and fatal illness,\r\none of the best known examples being that of the suicide of the Duc de\r\nPraslin,[737] who took, with suicidal intent, on Wednesday, August 18,\r\n1847, a dose of arsenious acid. The exact time of the act could not be\r\nascertained, but the first effects appeared at 10 P.M.; there were the\r\nusual signs of vomiting, followed on the next day by diarrhœa, fainting,\r\nand extreme feebleness of the pulse. On Friday there was a remission of\r\nthe symptoms, but great coldness of the limbs, intermittency and\r\nfeebleness of the heart’s action, and depression. On Saturday there was\r\nslight fever, but no pain or tenderness in the abdomen, vomiting, or\r\ndiarrhœa; on this day no urine was passed. On the Sunday he complained\r\nof a severe constriction of the throat, and deglutition was extremely\r\npainful; thirst was extreme, the tongue intensely red, as well as the\r\nmucous membrane of the mouth and pharynx, and the patient had a\r\nsensation of burning from the mouth to the anus. The abdomen was painful\r\nand distended, the heat of the skin was pronounced, the pulse frequent\r\nand irregular,--sometimes strong, at others feeble,--the bowels had to\r\nbe relieved by injections, the urine was in very small quantity; during\r\nthe night there was no sleep. The duke died at 4.35 A.M. on Tuesday the\r\n24th, the sixth day; intelligence was retained to the last. As the end\r\napproached, the respiration became embarrassed, the body extremely cold,\r\nand the pulse very frequent.\r\n\r\n[737] Tardieu, “Relation Médico-Légale de l’Assassinat de la Duchesse de\r\nPraslin,” _Ann. d’Hyg. Pub. et de Médico-Lég._, 1847, t. xxxviii. p.\r\n390; also _op. cit._, Obs. xi.\r\n\r\n§ 728. =In the nervous form= the ordinary vomiting and purging are\r\neither entirely suppressed, or present in but feeble degree; and under\r\nthis heading are classed the rare cases in which, in place of the\r\nordinary symptoms, affections of the nervous system predominate.\r\nNarcotism, paresis, deepening into paralysis, delirium, and even acute\r\nmania, as well as epileptiform convulsions, have all been recorded. In\r\nshort, the symptoms show so much variety, that an idea of the malady\r\nproduced in this very rare form can only be obtained by studying the\r\nclinical history of cases which have presented this aspect. In a case\r\nrecorded by Guilbert,[738] a man, thirty-five years of age, had\r\nswallowed a solution of arsenic, half of which was immediately rejected\r\nby vomiting. A little while afterwards his respiration became laborious;\r\nthe eyes were bathed with tears, which were so acrid as to inflame the\r\neyelids and the cheeks; the muscles of the face were from time to time\r\nconvulsed; he perspired much, and the perspiration had a fœtid odour;\r\nthere was some diarrhœa, the urine was suppressed, and from time to time\r\nhe was delirious. Afterwards the convulsions became general, and the\r\nsymptoms continued with more or less severity for five days. On the\r\nsixth a copious miliary eruption broke out, and the symptoms became less\r\nsevere. The eruption during fifteen days every now and again reappeared,\r\nand at the end of that time the patient was convalescent, but weak,\r\nliable to ophthalmia, and had a universal trembling of the limbs.\r\n\r\n[738] _Journal de Van der Monde_, 1756, t. iv. p. 353; Tardieu, _op.\r\ncit._, Obs. xiii. p. 430.\r\n\r\nIn one of Brodie’s[739] experiments on rabbits, 7 grains of arsenious\r\nacid were inserted in a wound in the back; the effect of which was to\r\nparalyse the hind legs. In other experiments on animals, paralysis of\r\nthe hind legs has been frequently noticed, but paralysis certainly is\r\nrare in man; in the case, however, recorded by Barrier,[740] of the five\r\nmen who took by mistake a solution of arsenious acid, one of them was\r\nfound stretched on the ground with the inferior extremities paralysed.\r\n\r\n[739] “The Action of Poisons,” _Phil. Trans._, 1812.\r\n\r\n[740] _Journ. de Médecine_, 1783, p. 353; Tardieu, _op. cit._, Obs. xiv.\r\np. 431.\r\n\r\nIn a case of “mass” poisoning reported by Dr. Coqueret,[741] three\r\npersons ate by mistake an unknown quantity of arsenious acid--two of\r\nthem only suffered slightly, but the third severely, vomiting occurring\r\nalmost immediately, and continuing with frequency until the end of the\r\nfourth day. Two hours after swallowing the poison, the patient took the\r\nhydrated oxide of iron as an antidote. On the sixth day there was stupor\r\nand a semi-delirious state, with an eruption of a pustular character\r\ncompared to that of the small-pox. These symptoms continued more or less\r\nuntil the fifteenth day, when they diminished, and ultimately the\r\npatient recovered. In a case related by Tardieu,[742] in which a person\r\ndied on the eleventh day from the effects of the poison, towards the\r\nend, as a specially marked symptom, there was noted hyperæsthesia of the\r\ninferior extremities, so that the least touch was painful.\r\n\r\n[741] _Journ. de Connaiss. Méd. Chirurg._, 1839, p. 155; Tardieu, _op.\r\ncit._, Obs. xv. p. 482.\r\n\r\n[742] _Op. cit._, Obs. xvii. p. 434.\r\n\r\n§ 729. =Absence of Symptoms.=--In a few cases there have been a\r\nremarkable absence of symptoms, and this both in man and animals. Seven\r\nhorses were fed with oats accidentally mixed with arseniate of soda.\r\nThe first succumbed three hours after taking the poison, without having\r\npresented any symptom whatever; he fell suddenly, and in a short time\r\nexpired.[743] It is related by Orfila,[744] that a woman, aged 27,\r\nexpired in about twelve hours from a large dose of arsenious acid; there\r\nwere the usual _post-mortem_ appearances, but in life no sign of pain,\r\nno vomiting, and but little thirst.\r\n\r\n[743] Bouley (Jeune), _Ann. d’Hyg. et de Médico-Lég._, 1834, t. xii. p.\r\n393.\r\n\r\n[744] Tome i. Obs. iv. p. 314.\r\n\r\n§ 730. =Slow Poisoning.=--Slow poisoning has been caused accidentally by\r\narsenical wall-paper, in the manufacture of arsenical pigments, by the\r\nadmixture of small quantities of arsenic with salt or other condiments,\r\nand repeated small doses have been used for criminally producing a fatal\r\nillness intended to simulate disease from natural causes. The illness\r\nproduced by small intermittent doses may closely resemble in miniature,\r\nas it were, those produced by large amounts; but, on the other hand,\r\nthey may be different and scarcely to be described otherwise than as a\r\ngeneral condition of ill-health and _malaise_. In such cases there is\r\nloss of appetite, feebleness, and not unfrequently a slight yellowness\r\nof the skin. A fairly constant effect seen, when a solution of arsenious\r\nacid is given continuously for a long time, is an inflammation of the\r\nconjunctivæ, as well as of the nasal mucous membrane--the patient\r\ncomplains of “always having a cold.” This inflammatory action also\r\naffects the pharynx, and may extend to the air-passages, and even to the\r\nlung-tissue. At the same time there is often seen an exanthem, which has\r\nreceived a specific name--“_eczema arsenicale_.” Salivation is present,\r\nthe gums are sore, at times lacerated. In chronic poisoning by arsenic,\r\nnervous symptoms are almost constant, and exhibit great variety; there\r\nmay be numbness, or the opposite condition, hyperæsthesia, in the\r\nextremities. In certain cases fainting, paresis, paralysis, and\r\nsometimes convulsions occur; towards the end a sort of hectic fever\r\nsupervenes, and the patient dies of exhaustion.\r\n\r\n    § 731. =The Maybrick Case.=[745]--The Maybrick case may be\r\n    considered an example of poisoning extending over a considerable\r\n    period of time:--Mr. James Maybrick, a Liverpool cotton-broker, aged\r\n    49, married Florence Elizabeth, an American lady, aged 21. They had\r\n    two children. The marriage proved an unhappy one. Some two years\r\n    before his death in May 1889 they had occupied two separate rooms.\r\n    Seven weeks before the husband’s death, Mrs. Maybrick went to London\r\n    on a false pretext, and lived for some days at an hotel, ostensibly\r\n    the wife of another man. Two days after her return, Mr. and Mrs.\r\n    Maybrick attended the Grand National race meeting, and there a\r\n    serious quarrel arose between them respecting the man with whom she\r\n    had cohabited in London; they returned from the race, each\r\n    separately, and she slept apart. Next day an apparent reconciliation\r\n    took place through the intervention of Dr. Fuller, the family\r\n    medical attendant.\r\n\r\n[745] “The Maybrick Trial and Arsenical Poisoning,” by Thos. Stevenson,\r\nM.D., _Guy’s Hosp. Rep._, 1889.\r\n\r\n    On or about April 12-19th, 1889, Mrs. Maybrick purchased arsenical\r\n    fly-papers. On April 13-20th Mr. Maybrick visited London, and\r\n    consulted Dr. Fuller for dyspepsia, who prescribed nux vomica,\r\n    acids, and mild remedies (but no arsenic); in one bottle of\r\n    medicine, ostensibly made according to Dr. Fuller’s prescription,\r\n    arsenic was subsequently found.\r\n\r\n    Up to Saturday, April 27th, Mr. Maybrick was in his usual health; he\r\n    was then sick, numbed, and in pain, and had cramps; he told his\r\n    clerk he had been an hour in the water-closet, but whether for\r\n    diarrhœa or constipation does not appear; he ascribed the symptoms\r\n    to an overdose of Fuller’s medicine. About this date fly-papers were\r\n    found by the servants soaking in Mrs. Maybrick’s bedroom in a\r\n    sponge-basin, carefully covered up. On the 29th she again purchased\r\n    two dozen fly-papers from another chemist. On April 28th Mr.\r\n    Maybrick was sick and ill; at 11 A.M. Dr. R. Humphreys was called\r\n    in; Mr. Maybrick complained of a peculiar sensation about his heart,\r\n    and said he was in dread of paralysis. He attributed his illness to\r\n    a strong cup of tea taken before breakfast. On the following day he\r\n    was better, and on the 30th still improving. On May 1st and 2nd Mr.\r\n    Maybrick went to his office and lunched, both days, off revalenta\r\n    food, prepared at home and warmed at his office in a new saucepan\r\n    purchased for the occasion; on one of these days the lunch was\r\n    forgotten, and was sent to Mr. Maybrick by his wife; and on one of\r\n    the two days, it is not clear which, Mr. Maybrick complained that\r\n    his lunch did not agree with him, and he attributed it to inferior\r\n    sherry put into his food.\r\n\r\n    In a jug found at the office, and in which food had been taken\r\n    there, a trace of the food still remained after Mr. Maybrick’s\r\n    death, and arsenic was found therein.\r\n\r\n    On May 3rd the last fatal illness set in. It is uncertain what food\r\n    he had after breakfast; he went to the office, and returned home\r\n    between 5 and 6 P.M. He had been seen by Dr. Humphreys in the\r\n    morning, and appeared then not quite so well; he found him at\r\n    midnight suffering from what he thought was severe sciatica; the\r\n    patient said he had been sick from revalenta. On May 4th he was\r\n    continually sick, nothing could be retained on the stomach, but the\r\n    sciatic pain was gone; on May 5th the vomiting continued, the\r\n    patient complained of the sensation of a hair sticking in the\r\n    throat, and of a filthy taste in the mouth. The throat and fauces\r\n    were only slightly reddened, the tongue was furred.\r\n\r\n    On May 6th there was less vomiting, but otherwise the condition was\r\n    the same, and Fowler’s solution ordered, but only a quantity equal\r\n    to 1/300 grain was actually taken.\r\n\r\n    May 7th the condition was improved, but there was no increase of\r\n    power. Dr. W. Carter was called in consultation. The vomiting was\r\n    passing away, and diarrhœa commencing. The throat was red, dry, and\r\n    glazed; there were incessant attempts to cough up an imaginary hair.\r\n    No cramps, no pain in the stomach or intestines, nor conjunctivitis.\r\n    On this day the first direct evidence of diarrhœa is recorded, the\r\n    medical men actually seeing a loose motion. The result of the\r\n    consultation was that Mr. Maybrick must have taken some irritant in\r\n    his food or drink.\r\n\r\n    On the 8th a professional nurse took charge. During the 8th and 9th\r\n    severe tenesmus set in with diarrhœa, and blood was observed in the\r\n    fæces. Now arsenic was suspected, the urine was examined by Dr.\r\n    Humphreys, and a rough analysis was made of some Neaves’ food which\r\n    the patient had been taking.\r\n\r\n    The patient died on the 10th, at 8.30 P.M.\r\n\r\n    The _post-mortem_ appearances were as follows:--\r\n\r\n    The tongue was dark, the top of the gullet slightly red, but\r\n    otherwise healthy, save at the lower end, where the mucous membrane\r\n    was gelatinous, and was dotted over with black dots, like frogs’\r\n    spawn.\r\n\r\n    There was a small shallow ulcer in the mucous membrane of the larynx\r\n    at the back of the epiglottis. The free margin of the epiglottis was\r\n    rough and eroded; and on the posterior aspect of the ericoid\r\n    cartilage there were two small red patches. In the stomach were\r\n    from 5-6 ozs. of brownish fluid. At the cardiac end there was a\r\n    large vermilion-red patch, interspersed here and there with small\r\n    dark ecchymoses (spoken of by Dr. Humphreys as a flea-bitten\r\n    appearance); to this followed a non-inflamed space, and near the\r\n    pyloric orifice, and extending 2 inches from it, was another red\r\n    inflamed portion of mucous membrane. In the small intestine the\r\n    mucous membrane was red and inflamed, from 3 inches below the\r\n    pylorus to about 3 feet downwards. About 18 or 20 feet lower down,\r\n    _i.e._, a little below the ileo-cæcal valve, the mucous membrane was\r\n    again inflamed to a lesser extent over a space of about 2 feet; the\r\n    lower end of the rectum was also red and inflamed. No arsenic was\r\n    found in the stomach or its contents, or in the spleen. Arsenic was\r\n    present in the liver, in the intestines, and in the kidneys. The\r\n    quantity separated altogether amounted to over 0·1 grain. The liver\r\n    weighed 48 ozs., and from 12 ozs. of the liver 0·076 grain of\r\n    arsenic, reckoned as As₂O₃, was separated.\r\n\r\n    The whole course of the symptoms and the _post-mortem_ examination\r\n    showed that the deceased died from an irritant poison; and from the\r\n    fact of a small quantity of arsenic having been found in the body,\r\n    there can be little doubt but that the poison was arsenic. The\r\n    symptoms were somewhat anomalous, but not more so than in other\r\n    recorded cases of undoubted arsenical poisoning. The facts that\r\n    tended to connect the accused with the death were as follows:--On\r\n    the night of either May 9th or the 10th Mrs. Maybrick was observed\r\n    to remove from the table an opened bottle of Valentine’s meat juice,\r\n    and take it into an inner dressing-room, and then replace it--the\r\n    acts being surreptitious. In replacing it, she was observed to take\r\n    it either from the pocket of her dressing-gown or from an inner\r\n    pocket. The lining of this pocket was found to be impregnated with\r\n    As₂O₃. The juice was found to contain 0·5 grain As₂O₃, and the\r\n    liquid was of lower gravity than commercial juice; it had probably,\r\n    therefore, been diluted.\r\n\r\n    The following is a list of things containing arsenic:--\r\n\r\n   1. Mrs. Maybrick’s dressing-gown.\r\n   2.       „         apron.\r\n   3. A handkerchief wrapped around a bottle.\r\n   4. Packet of arsenic “for cats.” (Arsenious acid mixed with char-\r\n      coal.) Tumbler containing milk, with handkerchief soaking in it;\r\n      at least 20 grains of As₂O₃ in the tumbler mixed with charcoal.\r\n   5. A portion of a handkerchief.\r\n   6. A bottle containing a strong solution of arsenious acid and\r\n      several grains of undissolved arsenious acid.\r\n   7. A bottle containing from 15-20 grains of solid arsenic and a few\r\n      drops of solution.\r\n   8. A saturated solution of arsenious acid and some solid arsenious\r\n      acid.\r\n   9. Valentine’s meat juice.\r\n  10. Price’s glycerin; ⅔ grain in the whole bottle.\r\n  11. A bottle containing 0·1 grain of arsenious acid.\r\n  12. A bottle from Mr. Maybrick’s office containing a few drops of\r\n      medicine prescribed by Dr. Fuller (decidedly arsenical).\r\n  13. Jug from the office with remains of food.\r\n  14. Sediment from trap of w.c. and lavatory drain containing As₂O₃.\r\n\r\n    Mrs. Maybrick was convicted, but afterwards the sentence was\r\n    commuted to penal servitude for life.\r\n\r\n§ 732. =Post-mortem Appearances in Animals.=--P. Hugo[746] has made some\r\nminute researches as to the pathological appearances met with in\r\nanimals. His experiments were made on seven dogs, eight guinea-pigs,\r\nfive rabbits, two pigeons, and five cats--all poisoned by arsenious\r\nacid. According to Hugo, so far as these animals were concerned, changes\r\nwere more constant in the intestine than in the stomach.\r\n\r\n[746] _Beiträge zur Pathologie der acuten Arsenikvergiftung., Archiv für\r\nexper. Pathol. u. Pharmakol._, Leipzig, 1882.\r\n\r\n=Stomach.=--Changes in the mucous membrane were especially noticed in\r\nthe great curvature and towards the pylorus; the pylorus itself, and a\r\npart of the cardiac portion, remained unchanged. The mucous membrane in\r\ndogs and cats was red, with a tinge of blue--in many cases the redness\r\nwas in streaks, with injection of the capillaries. The stomach of\r\nplant-eaters was less altered, and a microscopical examination of the\r\nmucous tissues did not show any fatty change.\r\n\r\n=The Intestines.=--In dogs and cats changes were evident; in rabbits and\r\nguinea-pigs they were not so marked, but the intestines of the last were\r\nextremely tender and brittle, very moist, and filled with a slimy,\r\nserous, grey-white fluid; nevertheless, the changes in all these animals\r\nappear to be of essentially the same nature. The most striking effect is\r\nthe shedding of a pseudo-membrane; in quite recent cases there is a\r\nlayer of from 1 to 1½ mm. wide of a transparent, frog-spawn-like jelly\r\nstreaking the intestine. In later stages it becomes thicker, while\r\noccasionally it resembles a diphtheritic exudation. The mucous membrane\r\nitself is deep purple-red, showing up by the side of the\r\npseudo-membrane. With regard to the villi, the epithelial layer is\r\ndetached, and the capillary network filled with blood and enlarged.\r\n\r\n=The Liver.=--Hugo met only occasionally with fatty degeneration of the\r\nliver, but there was marked steatosis of the epithelium of the\r\ngall-bladder of dogs. A fact not prominently noticed before, is (at all\r\nevents, in dogs) a serous transudation into the pleural sac and acute\r\nœdema of the lungs; the exudation may be excessive, so that more than\r\n100 c.c. of serous fluid can be obtained from the thorax; there is also\r\nusually much fluid in the pericardium. In two of Hugo’s experiments\r\nthere was fluid in the cerebral ventricles; and in all there was\r\nincreased moisture of the brain substance with injection of the\r\ncapillary vessels, especially of the pia.\r\n\r\n§ 733. =Post-mortem Appearances.=--A remarkable preservation of the body\r\nis commonly, but not constantly, observed. When it does occur it may\r\nhave great significance, particularly when the body is placed under\r\nconditions in which it might be expected to decompose rapidly. In the\r\ncelebrated Continental case of the apothecary Speichert (1876),\r\nSpeichert’s wife was exhumed eleven months after death. The coffin stood\r\npartly in water, the corpse was mummified. The organs contained arsenic,\r\nthe churchyard earth no arsenic. R. Koch was unable to explain the\r\npreservation of the body, under these conditions, in no other way than\r\nfrom the effect of arsenic; and this circumstance, with others, was an\r\nimportant element which led to the conviction of Speichert.\r\n\r\nWhen arsenious acid is swallowed in substance or solution, the most\r\nmarked change is that in the mucous membrane of the stomach and\r\nintestines; and, even when the poison has been absorbed by the skin, or\r\ntaken in any other way, there may be a very pronounced inflammatory\r\naction. On the other hand, this is occasionally absent. Orfila[747]\r\nrelates a case in which a man died in thirteen hours after having taken\r\n12 grms. of arsenious acid:--“The mucous membrane of the stomach\r\npresented in its whole extent no trace of inflammation, no redness, and\r\nno alteration of texture.” Many other similar cases are on record; and,\r\naccording to Harvey’s statistics, in 197 cases, 36 (about 18·2 per\r\ncent.) presented no lesion of the stomach.\r\n\r\n[747] Tome i. Obs. v.\r\n\r\nThe usual changes produced by arsenious acid may be studied in the\r\nmuseums of the London hospitals. In Guy’s Hospital Museum there are\r\nthree preparations. In preparation 1798³² is seen a large stomach with\r\nthe mucous membrane at certain points abraded, and at the great\r\ncurvature the whole coats are thinned; it is also somewhat congested. In\r\npreparation 1798⁶⁴ is a portion of coagulated lymph, from the stomach of\r\na lad, aged 14, who had taken accidentally a piece of cheese charged\r\nwith arsenious acid, prepared for the purpose of destroying rats. He\r\nlived twenty-eight hours, and presented the ordinary symptoms. The lymph\r\nhas a membranous appearance, and the rugæ of the stomach are impressed\r\nupon it. It is said when recent to have presented numerous bright bloody\r\nspots, although there was no visible breach of substance on the surface\r\nof the stomach. The mucous membrane of the stomach is stated to have\r\nbeen injected, and there was also diffuse injection of the duodenum.\r\nPreparation 1798⁸⁰ is the stomach of a person who survived thirteen\r\nhours after taking a fatal dose of arsenious acid; and in the same\r\nmuseum there is a wax model of the appearances which the fresh\r\npreparation exhibited, showing a large oval patch coated with mucus and\r\nthe poison. The stomach was intensely inflamed, the cæcum injected. The\r\nrest of the intestine was healthy.\r\n\r\nIn the museum of University College there are two preparations, one[748]\r\nexhibiting intense swelling and congestion of the gastric mucous\r\nmembrane, which is of a perfectly vermilion colour. Another preparation\r\n(No. 2868) shows the effect of a small dose of arsenic on the stomach;\r\nthere are spots of arborescent extravasation, and slight congestion of\r\nthe summits of the rugæ, but in other respects it is normal. There is\r\nalso a cast of Peyer’s patches from the same case, showing great\r\nprominence of the glands, with some injection of the intestinal mucous\r\nmembrane.\r\n\r\n[748] This preparation at the time of my visit had no number.\r\n\r\nIn St. Thomas’ Hospital there is an interesting preparation (No. 8)\r\nshowing the gastric mucous membrane dotted all over with minute ulcers,\r\nnone of which have an inflammatory zone.[749] I have not, however, seen\r\nin any museum a preparation of the curious emphysematous condition of\r\nthe mucous membrane, which has more than once been met with. For\r\nexample, in a case related by Tardieu,[750] Schwann, a labourer, died\r\nfrom the effects of arsenic in thirty-six hours. The autopsy showed that\r\nthe mucous membrane of the stomach and small intestine was covered with\r\na pasty coating, and was elevated in nearly its whole extent by bullæ\r\nfilled with gas, forming true emphysematous swellings which encroached\r\nupon the diameter of the intestine. There was neither redness nor\r\nulceration, but the mucous membrane was softened.\r\n\r\n[749] In a case related by Orfila, t. i. Obs. xv., death resulted from\r\nthe outward application of arsenic; the mucous membrane of the stomach\r\nwas natural in colour, but there were four ulcers, one of which was 50\r\ncentimetres in diameter.\r\n\r\n[750] _Op. cit._, Obs. i. p. 468.\r\n\r\nThe author saw, many years ago, at Barnard Castle, an autopsy made on a\r\ngentleman who died from arsenic. In this case the mucous membrane of the\r\nstomach presented a peculiar appearance, being raised here and there by\r\nlittle blebs, and very slightly reddened.\r\n\r\n§ 734. The inflammatory and other changes rarely affect the gullet.\r\nBrodie[751] never observed inflammation of the œsophagus as an effect of\r\narsenic; but, when arsenic is swallowed in the solid state, as in the\r\nsuicide of Soufflard, graphically described by Orfila,[752] it may be\r\naffected. In Soufflard’s case there was a vivid injection of the pharynx\r\nand gullet.\r\n\r\n[751] _Phil. Trans._, 1812.\r\n\r\n[752] T. i. p. 319.\r\n\r\nIn many instances, when the arsenic has been taken in the solid form,\r\nthe crystals with mucus and other matters adhere to the lining membrane.\r\nI have seen in the stomach of a horse, poisoned by an ounce of arsenic,\r\nan exquisite example of this. The inflammatory changes may be recognised\r\nmany months after death owing to the antiseptic properties of arsenic;\r\nnevertheless, great caution is necessary in giving an opinion, for there\r\nis often a remarkable redness induced by putrefactive changes in healthy\r\nstomachs. Casper,[753] on this point, very justly observes:--“If Orfila\r\nquotes a case from Lepelletier, in which the inflammatory redness of the\r\nmucous membrane of the stomach was to be recognised after nine months’\r\ninterment, and if Taylor cites two cases in which it was observed\r\nnineteen and twenty-one months after death respectively, this is in\r\ncontradiction of all that I, on my part, have seen in the very numerous\r\nexhumed corpses examined by me in relation to the gradual progress of\r\nputrefaction and of saponification, and I cannot help here suspecting a\r\nconfusion with the putrefactive imbibition redness of the mucous\r\nmembrane.”\r\n\r\n[753] _Handbuch_, vol. ii. p. 420.\r\n\r\nIf examined microscopically, the liver and kidneys show no change, save\r\na fatty degeneration and infiltration of the epithelial cells. In the\r\nmuscular substance of the heart, under the endocardium, there is almost\r\nconstantly noticed ecchymosis. In the most acute cases, in which a\r\ncholera-like diarrhœa has exhausted the sufferer, the blood may be\r\nthickened from loss of its aqueous constituents, and the whole of the\r\norgans will present that singularly dry appearance found in all cases in\r\nwhich there has been a copious draining away of the body fluids. In the\r\nnarcotic form of arsenical poisoning, the vessels of the brain have been\r\nnoted as congested, but this congestion is neither marked nor\r\npathognomonic. Among the rare pathological changes may be classed\r\nglossitis, in which the whole tongue has swollen, and is found so large\r\nas almost to fill the mouth. This has been explained, in one case, as\r\ncaused by solid arsenious acid having been left a little time in the\r\nmouth before swallowing it. On the other hand, it has also been observed\r\nwhen the poison has been absorbed from a cutaneous application. When\r\narsenic has been introduced into the vagina, the ordinary traces of\r\ninflammatory action have been seen, and, even without direct contact, an\r\ninflammation of the male and female sexual organs has been recorded,\r\nextending so far as gangrene. As a rule, putrefaction is remarkably\r\nretarded, and is especially slow in those organs which contain arsenic;\r\nso that, if the poison has been swallowed, the stomach will retain its\r\nform, and, even to a certain extent, its natural appearance, for an\r\nindefinite period. In corpses long buried of persons dying from\r\narsenical poisoning, the ordinary process of decay gives place to a\r\nsaponification, and such bodies present a striking contrast to others\r\nburied in the same graveyard. This retardation of putrefaction is what\r\nmight, _à priori_, be expected, for arsenic has been long in use as a\r\npreservative of organic tissues.\r\n\r\n§ 735. =Physiological Action of Arsenic.=--The older view with regard to\r\nthe essential action of arsenic was, without doubt, that the effects\r\nwere mainly local, and that death ensued from the corrosive action on\r\nthe stomach and other tissues--a view which is in its entirety no longer\r\naccepted; nevertheless, it is perfectly true that arsenic has a\r\ncorrosive local action; it will raise blisters on the skin, will inflame\r\nthe tongue or mucous membranes with which it comes in contact; and, in\r\nthose rapid cases in which extensive lesions have been found in the\r\nalimentary canal, it can hardly be denied that instances of death have\r\noccurred more from the local than the constitutional action. In the vast\r\nmajority of cases, however, there is certainly insufficient local action\r\nto account for death, and we must refer the lethal result to a more\r\nprofound and intimate effect on the nervous centres. The curious fact,\r\nthat, when arsenic is absorbed from a cutaneous surface or from a\r\nwound, the mucous membrane of the stomach inflames, is explained by the\r\nabsorption of the arsenic into the blood and its separation by the\r\nmucous membrane, in its passage exerting an irritant action. The\r\ndiarrhœa and hyperæmia of the internal abdominal organs have been\r\nreferred to a paralysis of the splanchnic nerves, but Esser considers\r\nthem due to an irritation of the ganglia in the intestinal walls. Binz\r\nhas advanced a new and original theory as to the action of arsenious\r\nacid; he considers that the protoplasm of the cells of many tissues\r\npossess the power of oxidising arsenious acid to arsenic acid, and this\r\narsenic acid is again, by the same agency, reduced to arsenious acid, in\r\nthis way, by the alternate oxidation and reduction of the arsenious\r\nacid, the cells are decomposed, and a fatty degeneration takes place.\r\nThus arsenic causes fatty changes in the liver, kidney, and other cells\r\nby a process analogous to the action of phosphorus. T. Araki[754] also\r\nconsiders that both arsenic and phosphorus lessen oxidation, and points\r\nout that lactic acid appears in the urine when either of these poisons\r\nare taken, such acid being the result of insufficient oxidation. A\r\nnotable diminution of arterial pressure has been observed. In an\r\nexperiment by Hugo[755] ·03 grm. of As₂O₃ was injected intravenously,\r\nthe normal arterial pressure being 178 mm. Ten minutes after injection\r\nthe pressure sank to 47 mm.; in sixteen minutes it again rose to 127 mm.\r\nAccumulative action of arsenic does not occur. Hebra has given, in skin\r\ndiseases, during many months, a total quantity of 12 grms. without evil\r\nresult.\r\n\r\n[754] _Zeit. physiol. Chem._, xvii. 311-339.\r\n\r\n[755] _Op. cit._\r\n\r\n§ 736. =Elimination of Arsenic.=--Arsenic is separated especially by the\r\nurine,[756] then through the bile, and by the perspiration. The eruption\r\noften observed on the skin has been referred to the local action of\r\nsmall quantities of arsenic in this way eliminated. It is found in the\r\nurine first after from five to six hours, but the elimination from a\r\nsingle dose is not finished till a period of from five to eight days; it\r\nhas often been looked for twelve days after taking it, but very seldom\r\nfound. According to Vitali, the arsenic in the urine is not free, but\r\nprobably displaces phosphorus in phospho-glyceric acid; possibly it may\r\nalso replace phosphorus in lecithin.\r\n\r\n[756] An old experiment of Orfila’s has some practical bearings, and may\r\nbe cited here. A dog was treated by ·12 grm. of arsenious acid, and\r\nsupplied plentifully with liquid to drink; his urine, analysed from time\r\nto time during ten days, gave abundant evidences of arsenic. On killing\r\nthe animal by hanging on the tenth day, no arsenic could be detected in\r\nany of the organs of the body; it had been, as it were, washed out.\r\n\r\n§ 737. =Antidote and Treatment.=--In any case in which there is\r\nopportunity for _immediate_ treatment, ferric hydrate should be\r\nadministered as an antidote. Ferric hydrate converts the soluble\r\narsenious acid into the insoluble ferric arseniate, the ferric oxide\r\nbeing reduced to ferrous oxide. It is necessary to use ferric hydrate\r\nrecently prepared, for if dried it changes into an oxyhydrate, or even\r\nif kept under water the same change occurs, so that (according to the\r\nexperiments of Messrs. T. & H. Smith) after four months the power of the\r\nmoist mass is reduced to one-half, and after five months to one-fourth.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that ferric hydrate is not in the true sense of the word\r\nan antidote, for it will only act when it comes in contact with the\r\narsenious acid; and, when once the poison has been removed from the\r\nstomach by absorption into the tissues, the administration of the\r\nhydrate is absolutely useless. Ferric hydrate may be readily prepared by\r\nadding strong ammonia to the solution or tincture of ferric chloride,\r\nfound in every medical man’s surgery and in every chemist’s shop, care\r\nbeing taken to add no caustic excess of ammonia; the liquid need not be\r\nfiltered, but should be at once administered. With regard to other\r\nmethods of medical treatment, they are simply those suggested by the\r\nsymptoms and well-known effects of the poison. When absorbed, the\r\ndrinking of water in excess cannot but assist its elimination by the\r\nkidneys.\r\n\r\n§ 738. =Detection of Arsenic.=--The analyst may have to identify arsenic\r\nin substance, in solution, in alloys, in wall-papers, in earth, and in\r\nvarious animal, fatty, resinous, or other organic matters.\r\n\r\n=Arsenious Acid in Substance.=--The general characters of arsenious acid\r\nhave been already described, and are themselves so marked as to be\r\nunmistakable. The following are the most conclusive tests:--\r\n\r\n(1) A small fragment placed in the subliming cell (p. 258), and heated\r\nto about the temperature of 137·7° (286° F.), at once sublimes in the\r\nform of an amorphous powder, if the upper glass disc is cool; but if\r\nheated (as it should be) to nearly the same temperature as the lower,\r\ncharacteristic crystals are obtained, remarkable for their brilliancy\r\nand permanency, and almost always distinct and separate. The prevailing\r\nform is the regular octahedron, but the rhombic dodecahedron, the\r\nrectangular prism, superimposed crystals, half crystals, deep triangular\r\nplates like tetrahedra, and irregular and confused forms, all\r\noccasionally occur.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n(2) A beautiful and well-known test is that of Berzelius:--A small\r\nhard-glass tube is taken, and the closed end drawn out to the size of a\r\nknitting needle. Within the extreme point of this fine part is placed\r\nthe fragment (which may be no more than a milligramme) and a splinter of\r\ncharcoal, fine enough to enter freely the narrow part, as shown in the\r\nfigure. The portion of the tube containing the charcoal (_e_) is first\r\nheated until it glows, and then the extreme end; if arsenic is present,\r\na mirror-like coating is easily obtained in the broader portion of the\r\ntube (_d_). That this coating is really arsenical can be established by\r\nthe behaviour of metallic crusts of arsenic towards solvents (as given\r\nat p. 557). The portion of the tube containing the crust may also be\r\nbroken up, put in a very short, wide test-tube (the mouth of which is\r\noccupied by a circle of thin microscopic glass) and heated, when the\r\narsenic will sublime on to the glass disc, partly as a metal and partly\r\nas crystalline arsenious acid.\r\n\r\n(3) Arsenious acid, itself inodorous, when heated on coal, after mixing\r\nit with moist oxalate of potash, evolves a peculiar garlic-like odour.\r\nTo this test oxide of antimony adulterated with arsenic will respond, if\r\nthere is only a thousandth part present. Simply projecting arsenious\r\nacid on either red-hot charcoal or iron produces the same odour.\r\n\r\n(4) A little bit of arsenious acid, heated in a matrass with two or\r\nthree times its weight of acetate of potash, evolves the unsupportable\r\nodour of kakodyl.\r\n\r\n=Arsenites and Arseniates=, mixed with oxalate of soda and heated in a\r\nmatrass, afford distinct mirrors, especially the arsenites of the earths\r\nand silver; those of copper and iron are rather less distinct.\r\n\r\n=Sulphides of Arsenic= are reduced by any of the processes described on\r\np. 573 _et seq._\r\n\r\n=In Solution.=--An acid solution of arsenious acid gives, when treated\r\nwith SH₂, a canary-yellow precipitate, soluble in ammonia, carbonate of\r\nammonia, and bisulphite of potash, and also a metallic sublimate when\r\nheated in a tube with the reducing agents in the manner described at p.\r\n575. By these properties the sulphide is distinguished and, indeed,\r\nseparated from antimony, tin, and cadmium.\r\n\r\nThe sulphides of tin and cadmium are certainly also yellow, but the\r\nlatter is quite insoluble in ammonia, while the former gives no metallic\r\nsublimate when heated with reducing substances.\r\n\r\nThe sulphide of antimony, again, is orange, and quite insoluble in\r\npotassic bisulphite, and scarcely dissolves in ammonia.\r\n\r\nA small piece of sodium amalgam placed in a test-tube or flask\r\ncontaining an arsenic-holding liquid, or the liquid made alkaline with\r\nsoda or potash and a little bit of aluminium added, produces in a short\r\ntime arsine, which will blacken a piece of paper, soaked in nitrate of\r\nsilver, and inserted in the mouth of the flask. This is certainly the\r\nmost convenient test for arsenic. No antimoniuretted hydrogen\r\n(_stibine_) is given off from an alkaline solution and no SH₂.\r\n\r\n=Marsh’s Original Test for Arsenic= consisted in evolving nascent\r\nhydrogen by zinc and sulphuric acid, and then adding the liquid to be\r\ntested. The apparatus for Marsh’s test, in its simplest form, consists\r\nof a flask provided with a cork conveying two tubes, one a funnel\r\nreaching nearly to the bottom of the flask; the other, a delivery tube,\r\nwhich is of some length, is provided with a chloride of calcium\r\nbulb,[757] and towards the end is turned up at right angles, the end\r\nbeing narrowed. By evolving hydrogen from zinc and sulphuric acid, and\r\nthen adding portions of the liquid through the funnel, arseniuretted\r\nhydrogen in a dry state is driven along the leading tube, can be ignited\r\non its issue, and on depressing a piece of cold porcelain, a dark\r\nmetallic spot of arsenic is obtained.[758] Or, if any portion of the\r\ntube be made red-hot, the metal is deposited in the same way as a ring.\r\nThe apparatus admits of much complication and variety. One of the most\r\nuseful additions is, perhaps, the interposition of a small gasometer.\r\nThis consists of a cylindrical glass vessel with entrance and exit\r\ntubes, open at the bottom, immersed in water in a larger vessel, and\r\ncounterpoised by weights and rollers, exactly like the large gasometers\r\nused at gasworks; the exit tube must have a stop-cock, and the gas must\r\npass over calcic chloride in order to dry it thoroughly.\r\n\r\n[757] Otto recommends the first half of the drying tube connected with\r\nthe development flask to be filled with caustic potash, the latter half\r\nwith chloride of calcium (_Ausmittelung der Gifte_). Dragendorff\r\napproves of this, but remarks that it should be used when arsenic alone\r\nis searched for, since caustic potash decomposes stibine. The potash\r\nfixes SH₂, and prevents the formation of chloride of arsenic; on the\r\nother hand, it absorbs some little AsH₃.\r\n\r\n[758] For identification of arsenical films, see p. 557.\r\n\r\nM. Blondlot has observed[759] that if pure zinc, a weak solution of\r\narsenious acid, and a sulphuric acid containing nitric acid or nitrous\r\ncompounds, be mixed together, the arsenic passes into a solid hydrate,\r\nwhich is deposited on the surface of the zinc; this is, however,\r\nprevented by the addition of a little stannous chloride dissolved in\r\nhydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\n[759] Blondlot, “Transformation de l’arsenic en hydrure solide par\r\nl’hydrogène aissant sous l’influence des composés nitreux.”--_Jour. de\r\nPharm. et de Chim._, 3e sér., t. xliv. p. 486.\r\n\r\nThe precautions to be observed in Marsh’s test are:--\r\n\r\n(1) Absolute freedom of the reagents used from arsenic, antimony,[760]\r\nand other impurities.\r\n\r\n[760] With regard to purity of reagents, Sonnenschein states that he has\r\nonce found chlorate of potash contaminated with arsenic.--Sonnenschein,\r\n_Gericht. Chemie_, p. 139.\r\n\r\n(2) The sulphuric acid should be diluted with five times its weight of\r\nwater, and if freshly prepared should be cooled before use. Strong acid\r\nmust not be employed.[761]\r\n\r\n[761] M. A. Gautier uses sulphuric acid diluted with five times its\r\nweight of water; when the hydrogen has displaced the air, he adds to the\r\narsenical matter 45 grms. of this acid and 5 grms. of pure sulphuric\r\nacid.--_Bull. de la Société Chim. de Paris_, 1875, t. xxiv.\r\n\r\n(3) The fluid to be tested should be poured in little by little.\r\n\r\n(4) Nitrous compounds, nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, chlorides, are\r\nall more or less prejudicial.\r\n\r\n(5) The gas should come off regularly in not too strong a stream, nor\r\nout of too small an opening.\r\n\r\n(6) The gas should pass through the red-hot tube at least one hour, if\r\nno stain is at once detected.\r\n\r\n(7) Towards the end of the operation, a solution of stannous chloride in\r\nhydrochloric acid is to be added to the contents of the flask. This\r\naddition precipitates any arsenic present in a finely divided state, in\r\nwhich it is readily attacked by nascent hydrogen.[762]\r\n\r\n[762] F. W. Schmidt, _Zeit. anorg. Chem._, i. 353-359.\r\n\r\nThe characteristics of the metallic stains which may occur either on\r\nglass or porcelain in the use of Marsh’s test, may be noted as under:--\r\n\r\n  MIRROR OR CRUST OF ARSENIC          MIRROR OR CRUST OF ANTIMONY\r\n\r\n  Is deposited at a little distance   Is deposited close to the flame,\r\n  from the flame.                     and on both sides of it, and is\r\n                                      therefore notched.\r\n\r\n  An arsenical stain is in two        The stain is tolerably homo-\r\n  portions, the one brownish, the     geneous, and usually has a tin-\r\n  other a glittering black.           like lustre.\r\n\r\n  On heating, it is rapidly           Volatilisation very slow; no\r\n  volatilised as arsenious acid.      crystalline sublimate obtainable.\r\n\r\n  On transmission of a stream of      The same process applied in the\r\n  SH₂, whilst immediately behind the  case of antimony produces the\r\n  stain a gentle heat is applied,     orange or black sulphide; and on\r\n  the arsenic is changed to yellow    passing dry ClH, chloride of\r\n  sulphide;[763] if dry ClH is now    antimony volatilises without the\r\n  transmitted, the arsenical          application of heat.\r\n  sulphide is unchanged.\r\n\r\n  Chloride of lime dissolves the      Antimony not affected. Dissolves\r\n  arsenic completely.                 slowly but completely the\r\n                                      antimony stain.\r\n\r\n  Protochloride of tin has no action  No precipitate with antimony.\r\n  on metallic arsenic.\r\n\r\n  The arsenic stain, dissolved in\r\n  _aqua regia_, or ClH and chlorate\r\n  of potash, and then treated with\r\n  tartaric acid, ammonia, and\r\n  magnesia mixture, gives a\r\n  precipitate of ammonia magnesian\r\n  arseniate.[764]\r\n\r\n[763] It is desirable to dissolve away the free sulphur often deposited\r\nwith the arsenical sulphide by bisulphide of carbon.\r\n\r\n[764] Schönbein has proposed ozone as an oxidiser of arsenical stains.\r\nThe substance containing the stain, together with a piece of moist\r\nphosphorus, is placed under a shade, and left there for some time; the\r\noxidisation product is, of course, coloured yellow by SH₂ if it is\r\narsenious acid, orange if antimony. The vapour of iodine colours\r\nmetallic arsenic pale yellow, and later a brownish hue; on exposure to\r\nthe air it loses its colour. Iodine, on the other hand, gives with\r\nantimony a carmelite brown, changing to orange.\r\n\r\nAn arsenical ring may be also treated as follows:--Precipitated zinc\r\nsulphide is made into a paste with a little water, and introduced into\r\nthe end of the tube; the same end is then plunged into dilute sulphuric\r\nacid, and the ring heated, when the arsenical sulphide will be\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nThe mirror or crust of arsenic is usually described and weighed as being\r\ncomposed of the pure metal, but J. W. Rettgers has investigated the\r\nmatter, and the following is an abstract of his results:--\r\n\r\nThere is no amorphous form of arsenic, the variety generally thus called\r\nbeing crystalline. Two modifications can be distinguished: the one being\r\na hexagonal silver-white variety possessed of metallic lustre,\r\nspecifically heavier and less volatile than the second kind, which is\r\nblack in colour, crystallises apparently in the regular system, and\r\nconstitutes the true arsenic mirror. The former modification corresponds\r\nto red hexagonal phosphorus (red phosphorus having been recently proved\r\nby the author to be crystalline), and the latter to yellow phosphorus,\r\nwhich crystallises in the regular system. Both modifications of arsenic\r\nare perfectly opaque; deposits which are yellow or brown, and more or\r\nless transparent, consist of the suboxide and hydride, As₂O and AsH. The\r\nbrown spot on porcelain produced by contact with a flame of\r\narseniuretted hydrogen is not a thin film of As, but one of the brown\r\nsolid hydride AsH, formed by the decomposition of AsH₃. This view is\r\nconfirmed by the fact that arsenic sublimed in an indifferent gas\r\n(_e.g._, CO₂) is deposited in one or other of the modifications\r\ndescribed above, the brown transparent product being obtained only in\r\nthe presence of H or O. Moreover, pure arsenic is insoluble in all\r\nsolvents, whereas the film on porcelain (AsH) is soluble in many\r\nsolvents, including hydrocarbons of the benzene series (_e.g._, xylene),\r\nwarm methylene iodide, and hot caustic potash.\r\n\r\nHence quantitative results from weighing arsenical mirrors can never be\r\naccurate, because the mirrors consist of mixtures of hydride and\r\nsuboxide.\r\n\r\n=Reinsch’s Test.=--A piece of bright copper foil, boiled in an acid\r\nliquid containing either arsenic or antimony, or both, becomes coated\r\nwith a dark deposit of antimony or arsenic, as the case may be. The\r\narsenical stain, according to Lippert, is a true alloy, consisting of 1\r\narsenic to 5 copper.[765] Properly applied, the copper will withdraw\r\nevery trace of arsenic or antimony from a solution. Dr. John Clark[766]\r\nhas lately introduced some improvements in Reinsch’s process. His\r\nexperiments have been directed to the means of proving the presence of\r\narsenic or antimony in the stain on the copper with greater certainty,\r\nand at the same time estimating the amount when they occur together.\r\n\r\n[765] _Journ. f. pract. Chem._, xiii. 168.\r\n\r\n[766] _Journ. Chem. Soc._, June 1893, 886.\r\n\r\nThe material to be tested is boiled gently in a porcelain vessel with\r\ndilute hydrochloric acid and a small strip of copper about 1 inch long\r\nby ¼ inch broad, till the absence of arsenic or antimony has been\r\nascertained, or a coating has been produced. When the coating is\r\ndecided, the piece of copper is taken out, washed first with water, then\r\nwith a little alcohol to get rid of fatty matter, and finally with\r\nwater. It is then placed in a mixture of dilute caustic potash and\r\nperoxide of hydrogen, and allowed to digest in the cold. At the same\r\ntime a second piece of copper is introduced into the material which has\r\ngiven a deposit on the first piece, the washings of the first piece\r\nbeing added, and the boiling continued.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of the first piece of copper by caustic potash and\r\nperoxide of hydrogen dissolves any antimony or arsenic and restores the\r\ncopper to its original brightness; when this is accomplished, the second\r\npiece of copper is taken out and replaced by the first, and this second\r\npiece, if stained, is digested with potash, peroxide of hydrogen, and\r\nwashed as in the former case. The process is repeated until the slips of\r\ncopper cease to be stained in the slightest degree--until, in short, the\r\nwhole arsenic or antimony has been withdrawn.\r\n\r\nThe alkaline liquid contains the arsenic, as arsenate of potassium; the\r\nantimony, if present, as antimonate; and the solution is also\r\ncontaminated by a little hydrated copper oxide; this latter separates on\r\nboiling, and can be filtered off, and the filtrate is boiled down to a\r\nsmall bulk. The liquid is washed into a small distillation-flask with\r\nstrong hydrochloric acid, ferrous chloride is added, the flask, fitted\r\nwith a safety tube, is connected with a condenser, and the arsenic\r\ndistilled into water. To obtain the last traces of arsenic it may be\r\nnecessary to distil it twice in this way, adding, each time, fresh\r\nstrong acid and distilling to dryness. The distillate is then tested for\r\narsenic by adding an equal bulk of saturated SH₂ water. The sulphide of\r\narsenic may be dealt with as described (p. 573).\r\n\r\nThe residue in the flask is now tested for antimony by saturating with\r\nSH₂; should antimony be present, the precipitate by SH₂ will probably be\r\ndark coloured, because of a small quantity of copper. The precipitate is\r\ncollected, dissolved in dilute caustic soda, boiled, filtered to remove\r\ncopper sulphide, the filtrate acidified by hydrochloric acid, and\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen water added. If antimony was present, this time\r\nthe precipitate will be of an orange colour, and may be dealt with as\r\ndescribed (p. 589).\r\n\r\nThe test experiments with regard to this combined process appear\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n§ 739. =Arsenic in Glycerin.=--Arsenic has been frequently found in\r\ncommercial glycerin, the quantity varying from 0·1 to 1 mgrm. in 100\r\nc.c. The best method to detect the presence of arsenic in glycerin is as\r\nfollows:--A mixture of 5 c.c. of hydrochloric acid (1 : 7) and 1 grm. of\r\npure zinc is placed in a long test-tube, the mouth of which is covered\r\nwith a disc of filter-paper previously moistened with one or two drops\r\nof mercuric chloride solution, and dried. If arsenic is present, a\r\nyellow stain is produced upon the filter-paper within fifteen minutes,\r\nand it subsequently becomes darker.[767]\r\n\r\n[767] “Arsenic in Glycerin,” by Dr. H. B. H. Paul and A. J. Cownley,\r\n_Pharm. Journ._, Feb. 24, 1894.\r\n\r\n§ 740. =Arsenic in Organic Matters.=--Orfila and the older school of\r\nchemists took the greatest care, in searching for arsenic, to destroy\r\nthe last trace of organic matter. Orfila’s practice was to chop up the\r\nsubstance and make it into a paste with 400 to 700 grms. of water; to\r\nthis ·010 grm. KHO in alcohol was added, and ·020 grm. of potassic\r\nnitrate. The substances were heated up to from 80° to 90° for some time,\r\nuntil they were pretty well dissolved; the organic matter was then burnt\r\noff in a Hessian crucible heated to redness, on which small quantities\r\nof the matters were placed at a time. When the whole had thus been\r\nsubmitted to red heat, the melted mass was run into an almost red-hot\r\nporcelain basin, and allowed to cool. Afterwards, it was again heated\r\nwith concentrated sulphuric acid, until all nitric and nitrous fumes\r\nwere dissipated; on dissolving and filtering in water, the liquid was\r\nintroduced into a Marsh’s apparatus. Orfila never seems to have failed\r\nin detecting arsenic by this process. For an organ like the liver, he\r\nconsidered that 100 grms. of potash and 86 of strong sulphuric acid were\r\nnecessary in order to destroy the organic matters.\r\n\r\nThe liability of the various reagents used to impurity, and the\r\nprobability of loss in these operations, have tended to discredit\r\ndestruction of the organic matter by a red heat, and chemists generally\r\nhave preferred to oxidise animal matters by a moist process. The organic\r\nsubstance is divided finely and digested with dilute hydrochloric acid,\r\nand from time to time crystals of potassic chlorate are thrown in until\r\nall the fluid is very thin and capable of passing through a filter. The\r\nfiltrate must now be submitted to the prolonged action of sulphuretted\r\nhydrogen,[768] and the sulphide of arsenic separated from free sulphur\r\nby dissolving in sodic sulphide. After filtering, the arsenic sulphide\r\nmay be again thrown down by the addition of hydrochloric acid,\r\ncollected on a filter, and still further purified by solution in ammonic\r\ncarbonate; once more precipitated by hydrochloric acid, and lastly\r\nidentified by conversion into magnesia pyro-arseniate (see p. 572). The\r\nabove process is a general and safe way of detecting arsenic in almost\r\nany organic tissue, but the author prefers the distillation process\r\ndescribed p. 575 _et seq._\r\n\r\n[768] The SH₂ should be washed by passing it through two or more washing\r\nbottles supplied with warm dilute HCl--a few samples of sulphide of iron\r\ngive off an arseniferous gas, so that this precaution is necessary.\r\n\r\nFrom ordinary pills, quack extracts, and similar preparations, drying,\r\npowdering, and exhaustion with boiling dilute HCl, will remove the whole\r\nof the arsenic, if in a soluble state.\r\n\r\nOils and matters consisting almost entirely of fat, suspected of\r\ncontaining arsenic, are gently heated, and allowed to deposit any\r\ninsoluble matter they may contain; the oil is then decanted, and, if\r\nnecessary, filtered from any deposit; saponified by alcoholic potash,\r\nthe soap decomposed by HCl, the fatty acids separated, and the arsenic\r\nlooked for both in the first deposit and in the solution, now fairly\r\nfree from fat, and easy to treat.\r\n\r\nIn searching for arsenic in the fluids or tissues of the body, the\r\nanalyst is generally at the mercy of the pathologist, and sometimes the\r\nwork of the chemist leads to a negative result, solely from not having\r\nthe proper organ sent to him.[769]\r\n\r\n[769] For example, in cases of poisoning by external application, more\r\nthan once merely the empty stomach and a piece of intestine have been\r\nforwarded to the writer.\r\n\r\nBrodie long ago stated that when arsenious acid had been given in\r\nsolution to any animal capable of vomiting, no arsenic could be detected\r\nin the stomach; this statement is too absolute, but in the majority of\r\ncases true.\r\n\r\nIn all cases the chemist should have portions of the brain, spinal cord,\r\nliver, kidneys, lungs, and muscular tissue, as well as the stomach and\r\nits contents.\r\n\r\nAccording to the experiments of Scolosuboff,[770] arsenic is generally\r\ngreatest in the marrow, then in the brain, next in the liver, and least\r\nin the muscles, and the following may be taken as a fairly accurate\r\nstatement of the relative proportion in which arsenic is likely to be\r\nfound in the body, 100 grms. being taken of each:--\r\n\r\n[770] _Bull. Soc. Chim._ (2), xxiv. p. 124.\r\n\r\n  Muscles,           1\r\n  Liver,            10·8\r\n  Brain,            36·5\r\n  Spinal Marrow,    37·3\r\n\r\nBut Ludwig’s[771] experiments and conclusions are entirely opposed to\r\nthis, since both in acute and chronic cases he found as follows (per\r\ncent.

Of some considerable\r\nmoment is the question which may be put to the analyst in court, in\r\nreference to the possible entrance of arsenic into the living body, by\r\naccidental and, so to speak, _subtle_ means. Such are the inhaling of\r\nthe fumes from the burning of arsenical candles,[774] and of emanations\r\nfrom papers (see p. 541),[775] as well as the possible entrance of\r\narsenic into the body after death from various sources, such as\r\narsenical earth, &c.[776]\r\n\r\n[773] From some observations of Fresenius in a recent number of the\r\n_Zeitschrift f. anal. Chem._, it would seem necessary to test all glass\r\nvessels used; for it is difficult at present to purchase arsenic-free\r\nglass.\r\n\r\n[774] See a case of poisoning (non-fatal) of a lady by the use of\r\narsenical candles, _Med. Times and Gazette_, vol. iii., 1876, p. 367.\r\n\r\n[775] To solve this question, it has been at times considered necessary\r\nto analyse an extraordinary number of things. In the “affaire Danval”\r\n(_Journ. d’Hygiène_, 2e sér., No. 108, July 1878), more than sixty\r\ndifferent articles, comprising drugs, drinks, perfumes, bed-curtains,\r\nwall-paper, and other matters, were submitted to the experts.\r\n\r\n[776] The following important case is related by Sonnenschein:--\r\n\r\nNicholas Nobel and his wife, Jerome, were buried two metres from each\r\nother in the churchyard at Spinal, the earth of which notoriously\r\ncontained arsenic. A suspicion of poisoning arose. The bodies were\r\nexhumed, and arsenic was found in the stomach and intestines of Nobel,\r\nbut not the slightest trace in the corpse of the wife. The remains of\r\nthe bodies were reinterred, and after six months, on a fresh suspicion\r\nof poisoning arising, again exhumed. The corpse of the woman had been\r\nput naked in the moist earth during a heavy shower, but this time also\r\nno arsenic was detected in it.\r\n\r\n§ 741. =Imbibition of Arsenic after Death.=--The arguments which are\r\nlikely to be used, in favour of a corpse having become arsenical may be\r\ngathered from a case related by Sonnenschein:--Certain bodies were\r\nexhumed in two churchyards; the evidence went to show that they had been\r\npoisoned by arsenic, and this substance was actually found in the\r\nbodies, while at the same time it was discovered to exist also in traces\r\nin the earth of the churchyard. The theory for the defence was, that\r\nalthough the arsenic in the earth was in an insoluble state, yet that it\r\nmight combine with lime as an arsenite of lime; this arsenite would\r\nbecome soluble by the action of carbonic acid set free by vegetation,\r\nand filter down to the corpse. Sonnenschein suspended a quantity of this\r\nearth in water, and passed CO₂ through it for twelve hours; on\r\nfiltering, the liquid gave no evidence of arsenic. A similar result was\r\nobtained when an artificial mixture of 1 grm. of arsenious acid and 1\r\npound of earth were submitted to the same process.\r\n\r\nThe fact would appear to stand thus: oxide of iron in ordinary earth\r\nretains arsenic, and requires treatment with a concentrated acid to\r\ndissolve it. It therefore follows that, if a defence of arsenical earth\r\nis likely to be set up, and the analyst finds that by mere extraction of\r\nthe tissues by _water_ he can detect arsenic, the defence is in all\r\nprobability unsound. The expert should, of course, deal with this\r\nquestion on its merits, and without prejudice. According to\r\nEulenberg,[777] in arsenical earth--if, after having been crushed and\r\nwashed, it lies for some time exposed to the disintegrating action of\r\nthe air--soluble arsenical salts are formed, which may find their way\r\ninto brooks and supplies of drinking water. We may infer that it is\r\nhardly probable (except under very peculiar circumstances) for a corpse\r\nto be contaminated internally with an estimable quantity of arsenic from\r\nthe traces of arsenic met with in a few churchyards.\r\n\r\n[777] _Gewerbe Hygiene_, p. 234.\r\n\r\nIt occasionally happens that an exhumation is ordered a very long time\r\nafter death, when no organs or parts (save the bones) are to be\r\ndistinguished. In the case of a man long dead, the widow confessing that\r\nshe had administered poison, the bones were analysed by Sonnenschein,\r\nand a small quantity of arsenic found. Conièrbe and Orfila have both\r\nasserted that arsenic is a normal constituent of the bones--a statement\r\nwhich has been repeatedly disproved. Sonnenschein relates:[778]--“I\r\nprocured from a churchyard of this place (Berlin) the remnants of the\r\nbody of a person killed twenty-five years previously, and investigated\r\nseveral others in a similar way, without finding the least trace of\r\narsenic. Similar experiments in great number were repeated in my\r\nlaboratory, but in no case was arsenic recognised.” The opinion of the\r\nexpert, should he find arsenic in the bones, must be formed from the\r\namount discovered, and other circumstances.\r\n\r\n[778] _Gerichtl. Chem._, p. 212.\r\n\r\nA difficult case on which to form an opinion is one recorded by William\r\nP. Mason,[779] as follows:--\r\n\r\n[779] _Chem. News_, Feb. 23, 1894.\r\n\r\n    The deceased, a farmer, bachelor, sixty-five years of age, and in\r\n    good health, was taken violently sick shortly after breakfast, with\r\n    vomiting and distress in the stomach. Although a physician was\r\n    summoned, the symptoms increased in severity, and a little after\r\n    midnight death ensued. The funeral took place three days later.\r\n    Certain very damaging pieces of circumstantial evidence having been\r\n    collected, the housekeeper was arrested on the charge of murder, it\r\n    having been shown, among other things, that on the day preceding the\r\n    death she had purchased an ounce of white arsenic.\r\n\r\n    Thirty-five days after death (from March 20 to April 25) the body\r\n    was exhumed, and found in a state of remarkable preservation, and\r\n    free from cadaveric smell. The stomach presented evidences of\r\n    inflammation.\r\n\r\n    Portions sent for analysis were the stomach, portion of intestine,\r\n    portion of liver, one kidney, and the heart. Arsenic was found in\r\n    all these parts. White octahedral crystals were found in the\r\n    contents of the stomach, which on separation gave arsenical\r\n    reaction.\r\n\r\n    The arsenic found was:--\r\n\r\n  Stomach and intestine,                 0·2376 grm.\r\n  Liver and kidney,                      0·0032  „\r\n  Heart,                                 0·0007  „\r\n                                         ------\r\n            Total as metallic arsenic,   0·2415  „\r\n\r\n    The amount of arsenic recovered and produced in court was in\r\n    quantity sufficient to produce death. Some time after the analytical\r\n    report was made to the coroner, it was learned that an embalming\r\n    fluid, highly arsenical in character, had been used upon the body by\r\n    the undertaker at the time of preparation for burial. No injection\r\n    of this embalming fluid was practised, but cloths wrung out in the\r\n    fluid were laid upon the face and chest, and were kept constantly\r\n    wet therewith during a period of many hours. In all about two quarts\r\n    of embalming fluid were so used. Its composition appeared to be a\r\n    strongly acidified solution of sodium arsenite and zinc sulphate.\r\n    Only the arsenic and zinc were determined quantitatively, and they\r\n    were found to be, zinc (metallic), 1·978 per cent., and arsenic\r\n    (metallic), 1·365 per cent. by weight. An amount of this fluid\r\n    measuring 15·7 c.c. would thus contain a weight of arsenic equal to\r\n    that actually recovered from the body.\r\n\r\n    Extended medical testimony was offered by the prosecution, tending\r\n    to show that, under the given circumstances, no fluid of any kind\r\n    could have reached the stomach through the nose or mouth after\r\n    death, thus anticipating what the defence afterwards claimed, that\r\n    the undertaker was responsible for the arsenic discovered in the\r\n    remains.\r\n\r\n    In order to gather further light upon the possibility of cadaveric\r\n    imbibition of embalming fluid through the unbroken skin, test was\r\n    made for zinc in the heart and stomach, and distinct traces of the\r\n    metal were found in each instance. That at least a portion of the\r\n    arsenic found in the body was due to _post-mortem_ causes was thus\r\n    distinctly proven. A weighed portion (62 grms.) of the stomach and\r\n    contents was then most carefully analysed quantitatively for both\r\n    zinc and arsenic with the following results:--Arsenic, 0·0648 grm.,\r\n    and zinc, 0·0079 grm. Bearing in mind the relative quantities of the\r\n    two metals in the embalming fluid, it will be seen that the arsenic\r\n    found in the 62 grms. of the stomach was nearly twelve times larger\r\n    than it should have been to have balanced the zinc which was also\r\n    present. This fact, together with the discovery of crystals of white\r\n    arsenic in the stomach, constituted the case for the prosecution, so\r\n    far as the chemical evidence was concerned.\r\n\r\n    The defence made an unsuccessful effort to show that the crystals of\r\n    the tri-oxide originated from the spontaneous evaporation of the\r\n    embalming fluid. The prosecution met this point by proving that such\r\n    fluid had been abundantly experimented upon by exposure to a very\r\n    low temperature during an interval of several months, and also by\r\n    spontaneous evaporation with a view of testing that very question,\r\n    and that the results had in every case been negative. Special\r\n    importance was given these experiments, because of the well-known\r\n    separation of octahedral crystals during the spontaneous evaporation\r\n    of a hydrochloric acid solution of the white oxide, it having also\r\n    appeared that, in the manufacture of the embalming fluid, the\r\n    arsenic was used as white arsenic.\r\n\r\n    A very strong point was finally raised for the defence by the\r\n    inability of the expert on the side of the prosecution to state\r\n    positively whether or not an embalming fluid of the above\r\n    composition would diffuse as a whole through dead tissue, or its\r\n    several parts would be imbibed at different rates of speed, the zinc\r\n    portion becoming arrested by albuminoid material and being therefore\r\n    outstripped by the arsenic, or _vice versa_. The prisoner was\r\n    ultimately acquitted.\r\n\r\nIn a case which occurred in the Western States of America, there was\r\ngood reason for believing that arsenic had been introduced into the\r\ncorpse of a man _after_ his decease. With regard to the imbibition of\r\narsenic thus introduced, Orfila[780] says:--“I have often introduced\r\ninto the stomach (as well as the rectum) of the corpses of men and dogs\r\n2 to 3 grms. of arsenious acid, dissolved in from 400 to 500 grms. of\r\nwater, and have examined the different viscera at the end of eight, ten,\r\nor twenty days. Constantly I have recognised the effects of cadaveric\r\nimbibition. Sections of the liver or other organs which touch the\r\ndigestive canal, carefully cut and analysed, furnished arsenic, which\r\ncould not be obtained sensibly (or not at all) from sections which had\r\nnot been in contact with this canal. If the corpse remained long on the\r\nback after arsenious acid had been introduced into the stomach, I could\r\nobtain this metal from the left half of the diaphragm and from the\r\ninferior lobe of the left lung, whilst I did not obtain it from other\r\nportions of the diaphragm nor from the right lung.” Dr. Reece has also\r\nmade some experiments on the imbibition of arsenic after death. He\r\ninjected solutions of arsenious acid into the stomach of various\r\nwarm-blooded animals, and found at various periods arsenic, not alone in\r\nthe intestinal canal, but also in the spleen, liver, and kidneys.\r\n\r\n[780] _Op. cit._, t. i. p. 309.\r\n\r\n§ 742. =Analysis of Wall-Paper for Arsenic.=--The separation of arsenic\r\nfrom paper admits of great variety of manipulation. A quick special\r\nmethod is as follows:--The paper is saturated with chlorate of potash\r\nsolution, dried, set on fire in a suitable plate, and instantly covered\r\nwith a bell-glass. The ash is collected, pulverised, and exhausted with\r\ncold water, which has previously thoroughly cleansed the plate and\r\nbell-glass; the arsenic in combination with the potash is dissolved,\r\nwhilst oxides of chromium, copper, aluminium, tin, and lead remain in\r\nthe insoluble portion.[781]\r\n\r\n[781] Kapferschlaeger: _Rev. Universelle des Mines_, 1876.\r\n\r\nFresenius and Hintz[782] have elaborated a method for the examination of\r\nwall-papers, fabrics, yarns, and similar substances, which, provided the\r\nreagents are pure, is accurate and easy. Twenty-five grms. of the\r\nsubstance are placed in a half-litre distilling flask or retort, and 250\r\nc.c. of HCl, specific gravity 1·19, added; after digestion for an hour,\r\n5 c.c. of a saturated solution of ferrous chloride are added, and the\r\nliquid slowly distilled until frothing stops any farther distillation. A\r\nfurther quantity of 100 c.c. HCl is then added, and distilled over. The\r\nreceiver, in each case, contains water, and must be kept cool. The\r\nunited distillates are diluted to 800 c.c. and saturated with SH₂. The\r\narsenious sulphide is collected on an asbestos filter. After partial\r\nwashing, it is heated with bromine in HCl of 1·9 specific gravity, and\r\nthe solution again distilled with ferrous chloride. The distillate, on\r\nnow being treated with SH₂, gives arsenious sulphide free from organic\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n[782] _Zeit. anal. Chem._, xxvii. 179-182.\r\n\r\n§ 743. =Estimation of Arsenic.=--Most of the methods for the\r\nquantitative determination of arsenic are also excellent tests for its\r\npresence. It may be regarded, indeed, as an axiom in legal chemistry,\r\nthat the precise amount of every substance detected, if it can be\r\nweighed or estimated by any process whatever, should be accurately\r\nstated. Indefinite expressions, such as “a small quantity was found,”\r\n“traces were detected,” &c., are most objectionable. The more perfect of\r\nthe methods of evolving arsenic can be made quantitative. For example,\r\nthe galvanic process introduced by Bloxam may be utilised as follows:--A\r\nfractional part of the arsenical solution is taken for the experiment;\r\nthe bottom of a narrow-necked bottle of about 100 c.c. capacity is\r\nremoved, and replaced by a piece of vegetable parchment. The neck of the\r\nbottle carries a cork, which is pierced by (1) a platinum wire, which is\r\nattached to a platinum electrode; (2) a short tube, bent at right\r\nangles, and connected by piping with a longer tube, which has also a\r\nrectangular bend, and dips into a solution of silver nitrate; (3) an\r\nordinary funnel-tube, reaching nearly to the bottom. The bottle is\r\nplaced in a beaker of such a size as to leave a small interval between\r\nthe two, and the whole apparatus stands in a large vessel of cold water.\r\nDilute sulphuric acid is now put into the bottle, and also into the\r\nbeaker, so that the fluid reaches exactly the same level in each. The\r\npositive platinum electrode of a battery of six of Grove’s cells, or\r\nother efficient combination, is immersed in the liquid outside the\r\nbottle, connection with the negative plate is established, and hydrogen\r\nvery soon comes off, and passes over into the nitrate of silver\r\nsolution. When all the air is expelled, a portion of the rectangular\r\ntube is heated to redness, and if there is no stain nor any reduction of\r\nthe silver, the acid is pure. If the gas is passed for a long time into\r\nthe silver solution, the silver will be reduced to some extent by the\r\nhydrogen, although arsenic-free;[783] so that it is better to rely upon\r\nthe metallic ring or stain, which is certain to be formed on heating a\r\nportion of the tube red-hot, and keeping it at that temperature for _at\r\nleast ten minutes_. The liquid is then passed through the funnel in\r\nsuccessive portions; if arsenic is present, there will be a decided\r\nmetallic ring on heating the tube as before, and if antimony is present,\r\nthere will also be a stain; the distinctions between these stains have\r\nbeen described at p. 557.\r\n\r\n[783] Nitrate of silver solution is reduced by H₂, CH₃, PH₃, and SbH₃;\r\nhence it is absolutely necessary in any qualitative examination to prove\r\nthat arsenious acid has actually been produced in the silver solution.\r\n\r\nThe tube is kept red-hot until the stain is very distinct; then the\r\nsource of heat is removed, and the gas allowed to bubble through the\r\nargentic nitrate solution, which it decomposes, as before detailed (p.\r\n526). This process is continued until, on placing the delivery tube in a\r\nsample of clear nitrate of silver solution, there is no darkening of\r\ncolour. In certain cases this may take a long time, but the apparatus,\r\nonce set to work, requires little superintendence. At the conclusion,\r\nthe whole of the arsenic is separated,--part is in the silver solution\r\nas arsenious acid, part in the tube as a ring of metallic arsenic. The\r\nportion of the tube containing the metallic arsenic should be cut off\r\nwith a file and weighed, the arsenic then removed and re-weighed; the\r\nloss is the metal approximately. Or, the weight of the film may be\r\nestimated by having a set of similar deposits of known weight or\r\nquantities, in tubes exactly corresponding to those used in the\r\nanalysis, and comparing or matching them.\r\n\r\nThe arsenious acid in the nitrate of silver may be dealt with in several\r\nways. The equation given (p. 526) shows clearly that pure arsine, passed\r\ninto nitrate of silver solution, decomposes it in such a manner that, if\r\neither the silver deposited or the free acid is estimated, the quantity\r\nof arsenic can from such data be deduced. In operating on organic\r\nliquids, ammonia and other products may be given off, rendering either\r\nof the indirect processes inadvisable. A very convenient method,\r\napplicable in many cases, is to throw out the silver by hydrochloric\r\nacid, alkalise the filtrate by bicarbonate of soda, and titrate with\r\niodine solution. The latter is made by dissolving exactly 12·7 grms. of\r\npure dry iodine by the aid of 18 grms. of potassic iodide in one litre\r\nof water, observing that the solution must take place in the cold,\r\nwithout the application of heat. The principle of the titration is, that\r\narsenious acid, in the presence of water and free alkali, is converted\r\ninto arsenic acid--\r\n\r\n  As₂O₃ + 4I + 2Na₂O = As₂O₅ + 4NaI.\r\n\r\nThe end of the reaction is known by adding a little starch-paste to the\r\nsolution; as soon as a blue colour appears, the process is finished.\r\n\r\nAnother convenient way by which (in very dilute solutions of arsenious\r\nacid) the arsenic may be determined, is a colorimetric method, which\r\ndepends on the fact that sulphuretted hydrogen, when arsenious acid is\r\npresent in small quantity, produces no precipitate at first, but a\r\nyellow colour, proportionate to the amount of arsenic present. The\r\nsilver solution containing arsenious acid is freed from silver by\r\nhydrochloric acid; a measured quantity of saturated SH₂ water is added\r\nto a fractional and, if necessary, diluted portion, in a Nessler\r\ncylinder or colorimetric apparatus, and the colour produced exactly\r\nimitated, by the aid of a dilute solution of arsenious acid, added from\r\na burette to a similar quantity of SH₂ water in another cylinder, the\r\nfluid being acidified with HCl.\r\n\r\n§ 744. =Destruction of the Organic Matter by Nitric Acid, and Subsequent\r\nReduction of the Arsenic Acid to Arsine (Arseniuretted Hydrogen), and\r\nfinal Estimation as Metallic Arsenic.=--This process, which is\r\nessentially a combination of several, has been much improved in its\r\ndetails by R. H. Chittenden and H. H. Donaldson.[784] 100 grms. of the\r\nsuspected matters, cut up into small pieces, are heated in a porcelain\r\ndish of suitable size, stirred by means of a glass rod with 23 c.c. of\r\npure concentrated nitric acid, and heated up to from 150° to 160°. When\r\nthe matters assume a yellow or orange colour, the bath is removed from\r\nthe source of heat, and 3 c.c. of pure concentrated sulphuric acid\r\nadded, and the mixture stirred, when the mass becomes brown, swells up,\r\nand evolves dense nitrous and other fumes. The vessel is again heated to\r\n180°, and while hot 8 c.c. of pure concentrated nitric acid are added,\r\ndrop by drop, with continual stirring. After this addition, it is heated\r\nto 200° for fifteen minutes, and the result on cooling is a hard\r\ncarbonaceous residue wholly free from nitric acid. The arsenic is in\r\nthis way oxidised into arsenic acid, which is easily soluble in water.\r\nThe contents of the dish are, therefore, perfectly extracted by boiling\r\nwater, the aqueous extract filtered, and evaporated to dryness. The next\r\nprocess is to obtain the arsenic in a metallic state:--\r\n\r\n[784] _American Chem. Journ._, vol. ii., No. 4; _Chem. News_, Jan. 1881,\r\np. 21.\r\n\r\nThe flask, a Bunsen’s wash-bottle of 200 c.c. capacity, is provided with\r\na small separating funnel of 65 c.c. capacity, with glass stop-cock.\r\nThis is a very material aid to the obtaining of a slow and even\r\nevolution of gas, an important desideratum when all loss is to be\r\navoided; for with only a funnel tube, every time a small portion of\r\nfluid is added, a sudden rush of gas takes place, with probably a small,\r\nbut still more or less appreciable, loss. But the separating funnel,\r\nfilled with the acid mixture, can be so arranged as to give a constant\r\nand regular supply of fluid at the rate of two or three drops per\r\nminute, more or less. The gas generated is dried by a calcic chloride\r\ntube, and then passes through a tube of hard glass, heated to a red heat\r\nby a miniature furnace of three Bunsen lamps with spread burners, so\r\nthat a continuous flame of 6 inches is obtained, and with a proper\r\nlength of cooled tube not a trace of arsenic passes by. The glass tube\r\nwhere heated is wound with a strip of wire gauze, both ends being\r\nsupported upon the edges of the lamp frame, so that the tube does not\r\nsink down when heated. The small furnace is provided with two\r\nappropriate side pieces of sheet metal, so that a steady flame is always\r\nobtained. When the quantity of arsenic is very small, the tube is\r\nnaturally so placed that the mirror is deposited in the narrow portion;\r\nbut when the arsenic is present to the extent of 0·005 grm., the tube\r\nshould be 6 mm. in inner diameter, and so arranged that fully 2 inches\r\nof this large tube are between the flame and the narrow portion. When\r\nthe quantity of arsenic is less, the tube can naturally be smaller.\r\n\r\nAcids of different strengths are made as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Acid No. 1.\r\n\r\n   545 c.c. pure conc. H₂SO₄.\r\n  5000 c.c. H₂O.\r\n\r\n  Acid No. 2.\r\n\r\n   109 c.c. pure conc. H₂SO₄.\r\n  1640 c.c. Acid No. 1.\r\n\r\n  Acid No. 3.\r\n\r\n   218 c.c. pure conc. H₂SO₄.\r\n  1640 c.c. Acid No. 1.\r\n\r\n  Acid No. 4.\r\n\r\n   530 c.c. pure conc. H₂SO₄.\r\n  1248 c.c. H₂O.\r\n\r\n25 to 35 grms. of granulated zinc, previously alloyed with a small\r\nquantity of platinum, are placed in the generator, and everything being\r\nin position, the apparatus is filled with hydrogen by the use of a small\r\nquantity of acid No. 2. After a sufficient time has elapsed, the gas is\r\nlighted at the jet, and the glass tube heated to a bright redness.\r\n\r\nThe arsenical solution in concentrated form is mixed with 45 c.c. of\r\nacid No. 2, and the mixture passed into the separating funnel, from\r\nwhich it is allowed to flow into the generator at such a rate that the\r\nentire fluid is introduced in one hour or one and a half; 40 c.c. of\r\nacid No. 3 are then added and allowed to flow slowly into the generator,\r\nand, lastly, 45 c.c. of acid No. 4. The amount of time required will\r\nvary with the amount of arsenic: 2 to 3 mgrms. of arsenic will require\r\nabout two to three hours for the entire decomposition, while 4 to 5\r\nmgrms. will need perhaps three to four hours. Where the amount of\r\narsenic is small, only 25 grms. of zinc are needed, and but 45 c.c. of\r\nacid No. 2, 30 c.c. of acid No. 3, and 30 c.c. of acid No. 4; but when\r\n4 to 5 mgrms. of arsenic are present, it is better to take the first\r\nmentioned quantities of zinc and acids.\r\n\r\nThe arsenic being thus collected as a large or small mirror of metal,\r\nthe tube is cut at a safe distance from the mirror, so that a tube of\r\nperhaps 2 to 6 grms. weight is obtained. This is carefully weighed, and\r\nthen the arsenic removed by simple heating; or, if the arsenic is to be\r\nsaved (as in a toxicological case), dissolved out with strong nitric\r\nacid. The tube is then cleaned, dried, and again weighed, the difference\r\ngiving the weight of metallic arsenic, from which, by a simple\r\ncalculation, the amount of arsenious oxide can be obtained. Some test\r\nresults are given as follows; they were obtained by introducing definite\r\nquantities of arsenious oxide in the form of a solution mixed with 45\r\nc.c. of No. 2 acid, &c.:--\r\n\r\n  Quantity of           Wt. of Metallic   Theoretical Wt. of\r\n  Arsenic introduced.

To estimate the quantities of\r\narsenic in the gas, the reduction tube is heated, and a mirror or\r\nmirrors obtained, and compared with a set of standard mirrors. The\r\nstandard mirrors are made as follows:--One grm. of arsenious oxide,\r\npurified by repeated sublimation, is dissolved with the aid of a little\r\nsodic bicarbonate, and, after acidification with dilute sulphuric acid,\r\nmade up to 1 litre. This standard solution contains 1 mgrm. of As₂O₃ in\r\nevery c.c., and is used to make a second standard solution, containing\r\n0·01 mgrm., to every c.c., by diluting 10 c.c. to a litre. Of this last\r\nsolution, 1 c.c., 2 c.c., 3 c.c., and so on, are measured and introduced\r\ninto the reduction flask, and the standard mirrors obtained. It is\r\nrecommended, for obvious reasons, to make more than one standard for\r\neach quantity, for the appearance of the mirrors from the same amount of\r\narsenic varies. The tubes are hermetically sealed, and, when not in use,\r\nkept in the dark.\r\n\r\nThis process is convenient for small amounts of arsenic; but, as stated\r\nbefore, the results are given as metallic arsenic, whereas the films\r\nappear never to be composed of pure metallic arsenic, but a mixture of\r\nhydride and suboxide. Test experiments give, however, fair results.[785]\r\n\r\n[785] _Proc. American Academy of Arts and Sciences_, vol. xxvi.\r\n\r\n§ 745. =Arsine Developed from an Alkaline Solution.=--Fleitmann\r\ndiscovered in 1851 that arsenic, mixed with finely divided zinc, and\r\nexcess of soda or potash added, evolved arsine; but no stibine was\r\nevolved under the same conditions. In 1873 J. W. Gatehouse suggested the\r\nuse of aluminium and sodic hydrate as a modification of Fleitmann’s\r\ntest, for the purpose of distinguishing between arsenic and antimony;\r\nand this is now the usual process adopted. The hydrogen comes off\r\nregularly even in the cold, but it is best to apply a little heat. This\r\ntest will evolve arsine from arsenious acid, and also from arsenic\r\ntrisulphide; but it is not available for the detection of arsenic, when\r\nthe arsenic is in the form of arsenic acid. According to Clark,[786] it\r\nis not adapted for quantitative purposes, because, owing to the\r\nformation of solid hydride, about one-fifth remains behind.\r\n\r\n[786] _Journ. Chem. Soc._, 1893, 884.\r\n\r\nE. W. Davy, in 1876, proposed the use of sodium amalgam for the\r\ngeneration of arsine; on the whole, it is, however, not so convenient as\r\nthe aluminium process.\r\n\r\nThe liquid to be tested is made strongly alkaline with pure sodic or\r\npotassic hydrate placed in a flask connected with a tube dipping into a\r\n4 per cent. solution of silver nitrate, a few pieces of sheet aluminium\r\nadded, and the flask gently heated; any arsine present will reduce the\r\nsilver. The silver solution thus blackened may be treated in the manner\r\ndescribed (p. 567).\r\n\r\n§ 746. =Precipitation as Tersulphide.=--Despite the advantages of some\r\nof the processes described, which are (to a certain extent) easy and\r\naccurate, not a few chemists still prefer the old method of\r\nprecipitation with hydric sulphide SH₂, because, although tedious, it\r\nhas stood the test of experience. If this be used, it is well in most\r\ncases to pass sulphurous anhydride through the liquid until it smells\r\nstrongly of the gas, for by this means any arsenic acid present is\r\nreduced, the sulphurous anhydride is quickly got rid of by a current of\r\ncarbonic anhydride, and then the liquid is saturated with hydric\r\nsulphide. In the ordinary way, much time is often wasted in saturating\r\nthe liquid with this gas. Those, however, who have large laboratories,\r\nand daily employ hydric sulphide, possess (or should possess) a water\r\nsaturated with the gas under pressure; such a liquid, added in equal\r\nvolume to an arsenical solution, is able to convert the whole of the\r\narsenic into sulphide in a very few minutes. Those who do not possess\r\nthis hydric sulphide water can saturate in an hour the liquid to be\r\ntested, by passing the gas in under pressure.[787] A convenient method\r\nis to evolve SH₂ from sulphide of antimony and ClH; the gas passes first\r\ninto a wash-bottle, and then into a strong flask containing the solution\r\nunder trial. This flask is furnished with a safety-valve, proportioned\r\nto the strength of the apparatus; the two tubes dipping into the\r\nwash-bottle and the last flask are provided with Bunsen’s valves, which\r\nonly allow the gas to pass in one direction. The hydric sulphide is then\r\ndriven over by heat, and when sufficient gas has in this way passed into\r\nthe liquid, the flame is withdrawn, and the apparatus allowed to stand\r\nfor some hours, the valves preventing any backward flow of the liquid or\r\ngas. When the precipitate has settled to the bottom, the supernatant\r\nfluid is carefully passed through a filter, and the precipitate washed\r\nby decantation in the flask, without transference to the filter, if it\r\ncan be avoided.\r\n\r\n[787] Hydric sulphide gas has been liquefied, and is now an article of\r\ncommerce, being sold in iron bottles.\r\n\r\nThe impure sulphide is washed with water, then with alcohol, then with\r\ncarbon disulphide, then, after having got rid of the lead, again with\r\nalcohol, and finally with water; it is then dissolved in ammonia, the\r\nammonia solution filtered, and the filtrate evaporated to dryness on a\r\nsand-bath, at a somewhat high temperature; in this way it is freed from\r\nsulphur and, to a great extent, from organic matter; after weighing, it\r\nmay be purified or identified by some of the following methods:--\r\n\r\n(_a_) =Solution in Ammonia and Estimation by Iodine.=[788]--The filter\r\nis pierced, the sulphide washed into a flask by ammonia water (which\r\nneed not be concentrated), and dissolved by warming, filtered from any\r\ninsoluble matter, and estimated by iodine and starch.\r\n\r\n[788] P. Champion and H. Pellett, _Bull. Soc. Chim._ (2), xxvj. pp.\r\n541-544.\r\n\r\n(_b_) =Oxidation of the Sulphide and Precipitation as Ammonia Magnesian\r\nArseniate, or Magnesia Pyro-Arseniate.=--The tersulphide, as before, is\r\ndissolved in ammonia (not omitting the filter-paper, which should be\r\nsoaked in this reagent), the solution filtered, and evaporated to\r\ndryness. The dry residue is now oxidised by fuming nitric acid, taking\r\ncare to protect the dish with a large watch-glass (or other cover)\r\nduring the first violent action; the dish is then heated in the\r\nwater-bath until all the sulphur has disappeared, and only a small bulk\r\nof the liquid remains; it is then diluted and precipitated by “magnesia\r\nmixture.”[789] The fluid must stand for several hours, and, if the\r\narsenic is to be determined as the usual ammoniacal salt, it must be\r\npassed through a weighed filter, and washed with a little ammoniacal\r\nwater (1 : 3). The solubility of the precipitate is considerable, and\r\nfor every 16 c.c. of the filtrate (not the washings) 1 mgrm. must be\r\nallowed. The precipitate, dried at 100°, 2(NH₄MgAsO₄)H₂O, represents\r\n39·47 per cent. metallic arsenic.\r\n\r\n[789] Magnesia Mixture:--\r\n\r\n  Sulphate of magnesia,       1\r\n  Chloride of ammonium,       1\r\n  Solution of ammonia,        4\r\n  Water,                      8\r\n\r\nDissolve; then allow to stand for several days; finally filter, and keep\r\nfor use.\r\n\r\nThe solubility of the magnesium arseniate itself, and the general\r\ndislike which chemists have to weighing in such hygroscopic material as\r\na filter, are, perhaps, the main reasons for the variation of this old\r\nmethod, which has lately come into notice. Rose proposed some time ago\r\nthe conversion of the double salt into the pyro-arseniate--a method\r\ncondemned by Fresenius and Parnell, but examined and pronounced a\r\npracticable and accurate process by Remol, Rammelsberg, Thorpe, Fuller,\r\nWittstein, Emerson, Macivor, Wood, and Brauner. The modification of\r\nRose’s process, recommended by Wood,[790] and still further improved by\r\nBrauner,[791] may be accepted.\r\n\r\n[790] _Zeitschrift für anal. Chem._, vol. xiv. p. 356.\r\n\r\n[791] _Ibid._, xvj. pp. 57, 58.\r\n\r\nThe precipitation is effected by magnesia mixture, with the addition of\r\nhalf its bulk of alcohol. The solution is allowed to stand for several\r\nhours, until it is possible to decant the clear liquid from the\r\nprecipitate; the latter is now dissolved in ClH, reprecipitated as\r\nbefore, thrown on a small filter, and washed with a mixture of one\r\nvolume of ammonia, two volumes of alcohol, and three of water.\r\n\r\nThe precipitate is now dried, and transferred as completely as possible\r\nfrom the filter into a small porcelain crucible, included in a larger\r\none made of platinum, moistened with nitric acid, covered and heated at\r\nfirst gently, lastly to a bright redness; the filter is then treated\r\nsimilarly, and the crucible with its contents weighed. Pyro-arseniate of\r\narsenic (Mg₂As₂O₇) contains 48·29 per cent. of metallic arsenic.\r\n\r\n(_c_) =Conversion of the Trisulphide of Arsenic into the Arsenomolybdate\r\nof Ammonia.=--The purified sulphide is oxidised by nitric acid, the acid\r\nsolution is rendered alkaline by ammonia, and then precipitated by a\r\nmolybdenum solution, made as follows:--100 grms. of molybdic acid are\r\ndissolved in 150 c.c. of ordinary ammonia and 80 of water; this solution\r\nis poured drop by drop into 500 c.c. of pure nitric acid and 300 c.c. of\r\nwater; it is allowed to settle, and, if necessary, filtered. The\r\nmolybdic solution must be mixed in excess with the liquid under\r\ntreatment, the temperature raised to 70° or 80°, and nitric acid added\r\nin excess until a yellow coloration appears; the liquid is then passed\r\nthrough a tared filter, and dried at 100°. It contains 5·1 per cent. of\r\narsenic acid [3·3 As].[792]\r\n\r\n[792] Champion and Pellett, _Bull. Soc. Chim._, Jan. 7, 1877.\r\n\r\n(_d_) =Conversion of the Sulphide into Metallic Arsenic.=--If there\r\nshould be any doubt as to the nature of the precipitated substances, the\r\nvery best way of resolving this doubt is to reduce the sulphide to\r\nmetal; the easiest method of proving this is to dissolve in potash and\r\nobtain arsine by the action of aluminium; or if it is desired to evolve\r\narsine from an acid solution with zinc in the usual way, then by\r\ndissolving a slight excess of zinc oxide in potash or soda, and\r\ndissolving in this the arsenic sulphide; the zinc combines with all the\r\nsulphur, and converts the sulpharsenite into arsenite; the zinc sulphide\r\nis filtered off, and the filtrate acidified and introduced into Marsh’s\r\napparatus. The original process of Fresenius was to mix the sulphide\r\nwith carbonate of soda and cyanide of potassium, and place the mixture\r\nin the wide part of a tube of hard German glass, drawn out at one end to\r\na capillary fineness. Carbonic anhydride, properly dried, was passed\r\nthrough the tube, and the portion containing the mixture heated to\r\nredness; in this way the arsenical sulphide was reduced, and the metal\r\ncondensed in the capillary portion, where the smallest quantity could be\r\nrecognised. A more elaborate and accurate process, based on the same\r\nprinciples, has been advocated by Mohr.[793]\r\n\r\n[793] Mohr’s _Toxicologie_, p. 57.\r\n\r\nA convenient quantity of carbonate of soda is added to the sulphide, and\r\nthe whole mixed with a very little water, and gently warmed. The yellow\r\nprecipitate is very soon dissolved, and then the whole is evaporated\r\ncarefully, until it is in a granular, somewhat moist, adhesive state. It\r\nis now transferred to a glass tube, open at top and bottom, but the top\r\nwidened into a funnel; this tube is firmly held perpendicularly on a\r\nglass plate, and the prepared sulphide hammered into a compact cylinder\r\nby the aid of a glass rod, which just fits the tube. The cylinder is now\r\ndried over a flame, until no more moisture is to be detected, and then\r\ntransferred into a glass tube 4 or 5 inches long, and with one end drawn\r\nto a point (the weight of this tube should be first accurately taken).\r\nThe tube is connected with the following series:--(1) A chloride of\r\ncalcium tube; (2) a small bottle containing nitrate of silver solution;\r\n(3) a hydrogen-generating bottle containing zinc and sulphuric acid. The\r\nhydrogen goes through the argentic nitrate solution, leaving behind any\r\nsulphur and arsenic it may contain; it is then dried by chloride of\r\ncalcium, and streams in a pure dry state over the cylinder of prepared\r\nsulphide (no error with regard to impurities in the gas is likely to\r\noccur; but in rigid inquiries it is advisable to heat a portion of the\r\ntube, previous to the insertion of the cylinder, for some time, in order\r\nto prove the absence of any external arsenical source); when it is\r\ncertain that pure hydrogen, unmixed with air, is being evolved, the\r\nportion of the tube in which the cylinder rests is heated slowly to\r\nredness, and the metallic arsenic sublimes at a little distance from the\r\nsource of heat. Loss is inevitable if the tube is too short, or the\r\nstream of hydrogen too powerful.\r\n\r\nThe tube after the operation is divided, the portion soiled by the soda\r\nthoroughly cleansed, and then both parts weighed; the difference between\r\nthe weight of the empty tube and the tube + arsenic gives the metallic\r\narsenic. This is the process as recommended by Mohr; it may, however, be\r\npointed out that the glass tube itself loses weight when any portion of\r\nit is kept red-hot for some little time; and, therefore, unless the\r\ncrust is required in the original tube, it is better to divide it,\r\ncarefully weigh the arsenical portion, remove the crust, and then\r\nre-weigh. The method is not perfectly accurate. The mirror is not pure\r\nmetallic arsenic (see p. 571), and if the white alkaline residue be\r\nexamined, arsenic will be detected in it, the reason being that the\r\narsenical sulphide generally contains pentasulphide of arsenic as well\r\nas free sulphur. Now the pentasulphide does not give up metallic arsenic\r\nwhen treated as before detailed; nor, indeed, does the trisulphide, if\r\nmixed with much sulphur, yield an arsenical crust. It is, therefore, of\r\ngreat moment to free the precipitate as much as possible from sulphur,\r\nbefore attempting the reduction.\r\n\r\nThe development of a reducing gas from a special and somewhat\r\ncomplicated apparatus is not absolutely necessary. The whole process of\r\nreduction, from beginning to end, may take place in a single tube by any\r\nof the following processes:--(1) The sulphide is mixed with oxalate of\r\nsoda (a salt which contains no water of crystallisation), and the dry\r\nmixture is transferred to a suitable tube, sealed at one end. An\r\narsenical mirror is readily obtained, and, if the heat is continued long\r\nenough, no arsenic remains behind--an excellent and easy method, in\r\nwhich the reducing gas is carbonic oxide, in an atmosphere of carbonic\r\nanhydride. (2) The sulphide is oxidised by _aqua regia_, and the\r\nsolution evaporated to complete dryness. The residue is then dissolved\r\nin a few drops of water, with the addition of some largish grains of\r\ngood wood charcoal (which absorb most of the solution), and the whole\r\ncarefully dried. The mass is now transferred to a tube closed at one\r\nend, a little charcoal added in the form of an upper layer, and heat\r\napplied first to this upper layer, so as to replace the air with CO₂,\r\nand then to bring the whole tube gradually to redness from above\r\ndownwards. In this case also the whole of the arsenic sublimes as a\r\nmetallic mirror.\r\n\r\nThere are various other modifications, but the above are trustworthy,\r\nand quite sufficient. Brugelmann’s method of determining arsenic,\r\nelsewhere described, would appear to possess some advantages, and to\r\npromise well; but the writer has had no personal experience of it with\r\nregard to arsenic.\r\n\r\n§ 747. =Conversion of Arsenic into Arsenious Chloride= (AsCl₃).--This\r\nprocess, first employed by Schneider and Fyfe, and afterwards modified\r\nby Taylor, differs from all the preceding, since an attempt is made to\r\nseparate by one operation volatile metallic chlorides, and to\r\ndestroy the organic matter, and thus obtain two liquids--one a\r\ndistillate--tolerably clear and free from solid particles, whilst the\r\nmass in the retort retains such metals as copper, and is in every way\r\neasy to deal with.\r\n\r\nSchneider and Fyfe employed sulphuric acid and common salt; but Taylor\r\nrecommends hydrochloric acid, which is in every respect preferable. As\r\nrecommended by Taylor, all matters, organic or otherwise, are to be\r\ncompletely desiccated before their introduction into a retort, and on\r\nthese dried substances sufficient pure hydrochloric acid poured, and the\r\ndistillation pushed to dryness. Every one is well aware how tedious is\r\nthe attempt to dry perfectly the organs of the body (such as liver, &c.)\r\nat any temperature low enough to ensure against volatilisation of such a\r\nsubstance as, _e.g._, calomel. This drying has, therefore, been the\r\ngreat stumbling-block which has prevented the general application of the\r\nprocess. It will be found, however, that drying in the ordinary way is\r\nby no means necessary. The writer cuts up the solid organ (such as\r\nliver, brain, &c.) with scissors into small pieces, and transfers them\r\nto a retort fitted by an air-tight joint to a Liebig condenser; the\r\ncondenser in its turn being connected with a flask by a tube passing\r\nthrough an india-rubber stopper dipping into a little water. Another\r\ntube from the same flask is connected with india-rubber piping, which is\r\nconnected with a water-pump, the fall tube of which terminates in the\r\nbasement of a house over a gully. The distillation is now carried on to\r\ncarbonisation; on cooling, a second quantity of hydrochloric acid is\r\nadded, and the last fraction of the distillate examined for arsenic. If\r\nany is found, a third distillation is necessary. At the termination of\r\nthe operation the retort is washed with water, the solution filtered,\r\nand this solution and the distillate are each separately examined for\r\narsenic. If properly performed, however, the second distillation brings\r\nover the whole of the arsenical chloride,[794] and none will be found in\r\nthe retort. With the above arrangement there can be no odour, nor is\r\nthere any loss of substance. In the distillate the arsenic can hardly be\r\nin the form of arsenious chloride, but rather arsenious acid and\r\nhydrochloric acid; for the chloride easily splits up in the presence of\r\nwater into these substances. It is best to convert it into the\r\ntrisulphide. Taylor[795] recommends evolving arsine in the usual way,\r\nand passing the arsine (AsH₃) into solution of silver nitrate, finally\r\nestimating it as an arseniate of silver. Objections with regard to the\r\nimpurity of reagents should be met by blank experiments. Kaiser[796]\r\nhas proposed and practised a modification of this method, which\r\nessentially consists in the use of sulphuric acid and sodic chloride (as\r\nin Schneider and Fyfe’s original process), and in passing the distillate\r\nfirst into a flask containing a crystal or two of potassium chlorate,\r\nand thence into an absorption bulb; in the latter most of the arsenic is\r\nfound in the form of arsenic acid, the chloride having been oxidised in\r\nits passage. The apparatus is, however, complicated in this way without\r\na corresponding advantage.[797] Lastly, E. Fischer[798] has shown that\r\nit is a considerable advantage to add from 10 to 20 c.c. of a saturated\r\nsolution of ferrous chloride before distilling with HCl. In this way all\r\nthe arsenic, whether as arsenic or arsenious acids, is easily converted\r\ninto chloride.\r\n\r\n[794] Dragendorff asserts to the contrary; but we may quote the\r\nauthority of Taylor, who has made several experiments, in which he\r\nobtained all the arsenic as chloride. The writer has performed the\r\nprocess many times, each time carefully testing the mass in the retort\r\nfor arsenic; but the result proved that it had entirely passed over.\r\n\r\n[795] _Principles of Medical Jurisprudence_, vol. i. p. 267.\r\n\r\n[796] _Zeitschr. f. anal. Chem._, xiv. pp. 250-281.\r\n\r\n[797] Selmi (_Atti dell. Accademia dei Lincei_, Fasc. ii., 1879)\r\nproposed a modification of Schneider’s process. The substances are\r\ntreated with hot, pure sulphuric acid, and at the same time the liquid\r\nis traversed by a stream of hydrochloric acid gas. The resulting\r\ndistillate is tested for arsenic by Marsh’s process. Selmi states that,\r\noperating in this way, he has detected 1/400 of a mgrm. of As₂O₃ in 100\r\ngrms. of animal matter.\r\n\r\n[798] _Scheidung u. Bestimmung d. Arsens_; Liebig’s _Annalen d.

Schneider), 120·14\r\n(Cook[799]); specific gravity, 6·715; fusing-point about 621° (1150°\r\nF.). In the course of analysis, metallic antimony may be seen as a black\r\npowder thrown down from solutions; as a film deposited on copper or\r\nplatinum; and, lastly, as a ring on the inside of a tube from the\r\ndecomposition of stibine. At a bright red-heat it is volatilised slowly,\r\neven when hydrogen is passed over it; chlorine, bromine, and iodine\r\ncombine with it directly. It may be boiled in concentrated ClH without\r\nsolution; but _aqua regia_, sulphides of potassium and sodium readily\r\ndissolve it. The distinction between thin films of this metal and of\r\narsenic on copper and glass are pointed out at pp. 557 and 559. It is\r\nchiefly used in the arts for purposes of alloy, and enters to a small\r\nextent into the composition of fireworks (_vide_ pp. 534 and 581).\r\n\r\n[799] _Ann. Phys. Chem._ (2), v. pp. 255-281.\r\n\r\n§ 749. =Antimonious Sulphide.=--Sulphide of antimony = 336; composition\r\nin 100 parts, Sb 71·76, S 28·24. The commercial article, known under the\r\nname of black antimony, is the native sulphide, freed from silicious\r\nmatter by fusion, and afterwards pulverised. It is a crystalline\r\nmetallic-looking powder, of a steel-grey colour, and is often much\r\ncontaminated with iron, lead, copper, and arsenic.\r\n\r\nThe amorphous sulphide (as obtained by saturating a solution of tartar\r\nemetic with SH₂) is an orange-red powder, soluble in potash and in\r\nammonic, sodic, and potassic sulphides; and dissolving also in\r\nconcentrated hydrochloric acid with evolution of SH₂. It is insoluble in\r\nwater and dilute acid, scarcely dissolves in carbonate of ammonia, and\r\nis quite insoluble in potassic bisulphite. If ignited gently in a stream\r\nof carbonic acid gas, the weight remains constant. To render it\r\nanhydrous, a heat of 200° is required.\r\n\r\nThe recognition of arsenic in the commercial sulphide is most easily\r\neffected by placing 2 grms. or more in a suitable retort (with\r\ncondenser), adding hydrochloric acid, and distilling. The chloride of\r\narsenic passes over before the chloride of antimony; and by not raising\r\nthe heat too high, very little antimony will come over, even if the\r\ndistillation be carried almost to dryness. The arsenic is detected in\r\nthe distillate by the ordinary methods.\r\n\r\nSeveral lamentable accidents have happened through mistaking the\r\nsulphide of antimony for oxide of manganese, and using it with potassic\r\nchlorate for the production of oxygen. The addition of a drop of\r\nhydrochloric acid, it is scarcely necessary to say, will distinguish\r\nbetween the two.\r\n\r\nAntimony is frequently estimated as sulphide. An amorphous tersulphide\r\nof mercury, containing a small admixture of antimonious oxide and\r\nsulphide of potassium, is known under the name of _Kermes mineral_, and\r\nhas lately been employed in the vulcanising of india-rubber. Prepared in\r\nthis way, the latter may be used for various purposes, and thus become a\r\nsource of danger. It behoves the analyst, therefore, in searching for\r\nantimony, to take special care not to use any india-rubber fittings\r\nwhich might contain the preparation.\r\n\r\nA _pentasulphide of antimony_ (from the decomposition of Schleppe’s salt\r\n[Na₃Sb₆S₄ + 9H₂O], when heated with an acid) is used in calico-printing.\r\n\r\n§ 750. =Tartarated Antimony, Tartrate of Potash and Antimony, or Tartar\r\nEmetic=, is, in a medico-legal sense, the most important of the\r\nantimonial salts. Its formula is KSbC₄H₄O₇H₂O, and 100 parts,\r\ntheoretically, should contain 35·2 per cent. of metallic antimony. The\r\nB.P. gives a method of estimation of tartar emetic not free from error,\r\nand Professor Dunstan has proposed the following:--Dissolve 0·3 grm. of\r\ntartar emetic in 80 c.c. of water, add to this 10 c.c. of a 5 per cent.\r\nsolution of sodium bicarbonate, and immediately titrate with a\r\ndecinormal solution of iodine, using starch as an indicator. One c.c. of\r\n_n_/10 iodine = 0·0166 grm. tartar emetic; therefore, if pure, the\r\nquantity used by 0·3 grm. should be 18 c.c. Tartar emetic occurs in\r\ncommerce in colourless, transparent, rhombic, octahedral crystals,\r\nslightly efflorescing in dry air.\r\n\r\nA crystal, placed in the subliming cell (p. 258), decrepitates at 193·3°\r\n(380° F.), sublimes at 248·8° (480° F.) very slowly and scantily, and\r\nchars at a still higher temperature, 287·7° (550° F.). On evaporating a\r\nfew drops of a solution of tartar emetic, and examining the residue by\r\nthe microscope, the crystals are either tetrahedra, cubes, or branched\r\nfigures. 100 parts of cold water dissolve 5 of tartar emetic, whilst the\r\nsame quantity of boiling water dissolves ten times as much, viz., 50.\r\nThe watery solution decomposes readily with the formation of algæ; it\r\ngives no precipitate with ferrocyanide of potassium, chloride of barium,\r\nor nitrate of silver, unless concentrated.\r\n\r\n§ 751. =Metantimonic Acid=, so familiar to the practical chemist from\r\nits insoluble sodium salt, is technically applied in the painting of\r\nglass, porcelain, and enamels; and in an impure condition, as antimony\r\nash, to the glazing of earthenware.\r\n\r\n§ 752. =Pharmaceutical, Veterinary, and Quack Preparations of\r\nAntimony.=[800]\r\n\r\n[800] The history of antimony as a drug is curious. Its use was\r\nprohibited in France in 1566, because it was considered poisonous, one\r\nBesnier being actually expelled from the faculty for transgressing the\r\nlaw on this point. The edict was repealed in 1650; but in 1668 there was\r\na fresh enactment, confining its use to the doctors of the faculty.\r\n\r\n(1) =Pharmaceutical Preparations=:--\r\n\r\n=Oxide of Antimony= (Sb₂O₃) is a white powder, fusible at a low red\r\nheat, and soluble without effervescence in hydrochloric acid, the\r\nsolution responding to the ordinary tests for antimony. Arsenic may be\r\npresent in it as an impurity; the readiest means of detection is to\r\nthrow small portions at a time on glowing charcoal, when very small\r\nquantities of arsenic will, under such conditions, emit the peculiar\r\nodour. Carbonate of lime appears also to have been found in the oxide of\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\n=Antimonial Powder= is composed of one part of oxide of antimony and two\r\nparts of phosphate of lime; in other words, it ought to give 33·3 per\r\ncent. of Sb₂O₃.\r\n\r\n=Tartar Emetic= itself has been already described. The preparations used\r\nin medicine are--\r\n\r\n=The Wine of Antimony= (=Vinum antimoniale=), which is a solution of\r\ntartar emetic in sherry wine, and should contain 2 grains of the salt in\r\neach ounce of the wine (0·45 grm. in 100 c.c.).\r\n\r\n=Antimony Ointment= (=Unguentum antimonii tartarati=) is a mechanical\r\nmixture of tartar emetic and lard, or simple ointment;[801] strength 20\r\nper cent. There is no recorded case of conviction for the adulteration\r\nof tartar emetic; cream of tartar is the only probable addition. In such\r\na case the mixture is less soluble than tartar emetic itself, and on\r\nadding a small quantity of carbonate of soda to a boiling solution of\r\nthe suspected salt, the precipitated oxide at first thrown down, becomes\r\nredissolved.\r\n\r\n[801] Simple ointment is composed of white wax 2, lard 3, almond oil 3\r\nparts.\r\n\r\n=Solution of Chloride of Antimony= is a solution of the terchloride in\r\nhydrochloric acid; it is a heavy liquid of a yellowish-red colour,\r\npowerfully escharotic; its specific gravity is 1·47; on dilution with\r\nwater, the whitish-yellow oxychloride of antimony is precipitated. One\r\ndrachm (3·549 c.c.) mixed with 4 ounces (112 c.c.) of a solution of\r\ntartaric acid (·25 : 4) gives a precipitate with SH₂, which weighs _at\r\nleast_ 22 grains (1·425 grm.). This liquid is used on very rare\r\noccasions as an outward application by medical men; farriers sometimes\r\nemploy it in the foot-rot of sheep.\r\n\r\n=Purified Black Antimony= (=Antimonium nigrum purificatum=) is the\r\npurified native sulphide Sb₂S₃; it should be absolutely free from\r\narsenic.\r\n\r\n=Sulphurated Antimony= (=Antimonium sulphuratum=) is a mixture of\r\nsulphide of antimony, Sb₂S₃, with a small and variable amount of oxide,\r\nSb₂O₃. The P.B. states that 60 grains (3·888 grms.) dissolved in ClH,\r\nand poured into water, should give a white precipitate of oxychloride of\r\nantimony, which (properly washed and dried) weighs about 53 grains\r\n(3·444 grms.). The officinal compound pill of subchloride of mercury\r\n(_Pilula hydrargyri subchloridi composita_) contains 1 grain (·0648\r\ngrm.) of sulphurated antimony in every 5 grains (·324 grm.), _i.e._, 20\r\nper cent.\r\n\r\n(2) =Patent and Quack Pills=:--\r\n\r\n    =Dr. J.

On evaporating the\r\n    chloroform the residue should taste extremely bitter; dissolved in\r\n    sulphuric acid it changes to a red colour, and dissolved in Fröhde’s\r\n    reagent to a cherry-red.

Brit._, 5th ed., art. “Antimony”:--“A horse that is lean and\r\nscrubby, and not to be fatted by any means, will become fat on taking a\r\ndose of antimony every morning for two months together. A boar fed for\r\nbrawn, and having an ounce of antimony given him every morning, will\r\nbecome fat a fortnight sooner than others put into the stye at the same\r\ntime, and fed in the same manner, but without the antimony.” Probably\r\nthe writer means by the term _antimony_ the impure sulphide. To this may\r\nbe added the undoubted fact, that in Brunswick the breeders of fat geese\r\nadd a small quantity of antimonious oxide to the food, as a traditional\r\ncustom.\r\n\r\n    =Liver of Antimony= is a preparation formerly much used by farriers.\r\n    It is a mixture of antimonious oxide, sulphide of potassium,\r\n    carbonate of potassium, and undecomposed trisulphide of antimony\r\n    (and may also contain sulphate of potassium), all in very\r\n    undetermined proportions. When deprived of the soluble potash salts,\r\n    it becomes the _washed saffron of antimony_ of the old pharmacists.\r\n    A receipt for a grease-ball, in a modern veterinary work, gives,\r\n    with liver of antimony, cream of tartar and guaiacum as ingredients.\r\n\r\n    =Hind’s Sweating-ball= is composed of 60 grains (3·888 grms.) of\r\n    tartar emetic and an equal portion of assafœtida, made up into a\r\n    ball with liquorice-powder and syrup. The assafœtida will be readily\r\n    detected by the odour, and the antimony by the methods already\r\n    recommended.\r\n\r\n    =Ethiops of Antimony=, very rarely used now, is the mechanical\r\n    mixture of the sulphides of antimony and mercury--proportions, 3 of\r\n    the former to 2 of the latter.\r\n\r\n    =The Flowers of Antimony= is an impure oxysulphide of antimony, with\r\n    variable proportions of trioxide and undecomposed trisulphide.\r\n\r\n    =Diaphoretic Antimony= (=calcined antimony=) is simply antimoniate\r\n    of potash.\r\n\r\n    =Glass of Antimony= is a mixture of sulphide and oxide of antimony,\r\n    contaminated with a small quantity of silica and iron.\r\n\r\n    A quack pill, by name, =Ward’s Red Pill=, is said to contain glass\r\n    of antimony and dragon’s blood.\r\n\r\n    =Antimonial Compounds used in Pyrotechny=:--\r\n\r\n  Blue Fire:--\r\n\r\n  Antimonious sulphide,      1\r\n  Sulphur,                   2\r\n  Nitre,                     6\r\n\r\n    This composition is used for the blue or Bengal signal-light at sea.\r\n    Bisulphide of carbon and water are solvents which will easily\r\n    separate the powder into its three constituents.\r\n\r\n  Crimson Fire:--\r\n\r\n  Potassic Chlorate,            17·25\r\n  Alder or Willow Charcoal,      4·5\r\n  Sulphur,                      18·\r\n  Nitrate of Strontia,          55·\r\n  Antimonious Sulphide,          5·5\r\n\r\n    The spectroscope will readily detect strontia and potassium, and the\r\n    analysis presents no difficulty. In addition to these a very great\r\n    number of other pyrotechnical preparations contain antimony.\r\n\r\n    § 753. =Alloys.=--Antimony is much used in alloys. The ancient\r\n    _Pocula emetica_, or everlasting emetic cups, were made of antimony,\r\n    and with wine standing in them for a day or two, they acquired\r\n    emetic properties. The principal antimonial alloys are Britannia and\r\n    type metal, the composition of which is as follows:--\r\n\r\n                                  Tin,       Copper,    Antimony,\r\n                                per cent.   per cent.   per cent.\r\n  Britannia Metal, Best,          92·0        1·8         6·2\r\n                   Common,        92·1        2·0         5·9\r\n                   For Castings,  92·9        1·8         5·3\r\n                   For Lamps,     94·0        1·3         4·7\r\n\r\n                                Tea Lead,  Antimony,   Block Tin,\r\n                                per cent.  per cent.   per cent.\r\n  Type Metal,            { (1.)   75         20           5\r\n                         { (2.)   70         25           5\r\n  Metal for Stereotype,           84·2       13·5         2·3\r\n\r\n    There is also antimony in brass, concave mirrors, bell-metal, &c.\r\n\r\n    § 754. =Pigments.=--Cassella and Naples yellow are principally\r\n    composed of the antimoniate of lead.\r\n\r\n    =Antimony Yellow= is a mixture of antimoniate of lead with basic\r\n    chloride of lead.\r\n\r\n§ 755. =Dose.=--A medicinal dose of a soluble antimonial salt should not\r\nexceed 97·2 mgrms. (1½ grain). With circumstances favouring its action,\r\na dose of 129·6 mgrms. (2 grains) has proved fatal;[803] but this is\r\nquite exceptional, and few medical men would consider so small a\r\nquantity dangerous for a healthy adult, especially since most\r\nposological tables prescribe tartar emetic as an emetic in doses from\r\n64·8 to 194·4 mgrms. (1 to 3 grains). The smallest dose which has killed\r\na child appears to be 48·5 mgrms. (¾ grain).[804] The dose of tartar\r\nemetic for horses and cattle is very large, as much as 5·832 grms. (90\r\ngrains) being often given to a horse in his gruel three times a day. 3·8\r\ngrms. (60 grains) are considered a full, but not an excessive, dose for\r\ncattle; ·38 grm. (6 grains) is used as an emetic for pigs, and half this\r\nquantity for dogs.\r\n\r\n[803] Taylor, Guy’s Hosp. Reports, Oct. 1857.\r\n\r\n[804] Op. cit.\r\n\r\n§ 756. =Effects of Tartar Emetic and of Antimony Oxide on\r\nAnimals.=--Large doses of tartar emetic act on the warm-blooded animals\r\nas on man; whether the poison is taken by the mouth, or injected\r\nsubcutaneously, all animals able to vomit[805] do so. The heart’s\r\naction, at first quickened, is afterwards slowed, weakened, and lastly\r\nparalysed. This action is noticed in cold as well as in warm-blooded\r\nanimals. It is to be ascribed to a direct action on the heart; for if\r\nthe brain and spinal cord of the frog be destroyed--or even if a\r\nsolution of the salt be applied direct to the frog’s heart separated\r\nfrom the body--the effect is the same. The weak action of the heart, of\r\ncourse, causes the blood-pressure to diminish, and the heart stops in\r\ndiastole. The voluntary muscles of the body are also weakened; the\r\nbreathing is affected, partly from the action on the muscles. The\r\ntemperature of the body is depressed (according to F. A. Falck’s\r\nresearches) from 4·4° to 6·2°.\r\n\r\n[805] L. Hermann (_Lehrbuch der experimentellen Toxicologie_) remarks\r\nthat the vomiting must be considered as a reflex action from the\r\ninflammatory excitement of the digestive apparatus, especially of the\r\nstomach. It is witnessed if the poison is administered subcutaneously or\r\ninjected into the brain. Indeed, it is established that (at least, so\r\nfar as the muscles are concerned) the co-ordinated movements producing\r\nvomiting are caused by excitement of the medulla oblongata. Giannussi\r\nand others found that after section between the first and third vertebræ\r\nof dogs, and subsequent administration of tartar emetic, no vomiting\r\ntook place; and Grimm’s researches seem to show that the suspected\r\n_vomit-centre_ is identical with the respiratory centre, so that the\r\nvomiting movement is only an abnormal respiratory movement. L. Hermann,\r\nhowever, considers the theory that when tartar emetic is introduced into\r\nthe vessels the _vomit-centre_ is directly excited, erroneous, for (1)\r\nin introducing it by the veins much larger doses are required to excite\r\nvomiting than by the stomach; and (2), after subcutaneous injection of\r\nthe salt, antimony is found in the first vomit. His explanation,\r\ntherefore, is that antimony is excreted by the intestinal tract, and in\r\nits passage excites this action. Majendie’s well-known\r\nexperiment--demonstrating that, after extirpation of the stomach,\r\nvomiting movements were noticed--is not considered opposed to this view.\r\n\r\nThe effect of small doses given repeatedly to animals has been several\r\ntimes investigated. Dr. Nevin[806] experimented upon eleven rabbits,\r\ngiving them tartar emetic four times a day in doses of 32·4 mgrms. (½\r\ngrain), 64·8 mgrms. (1 grain), and 129·6 mgrms. (2 grains). Five died,\r\nthe first after four, the last after seventeen days; three were killed\r\nafter one, three, and four days respectively, two after an interval of\r\nfourteen days, and one thirty-one days after taking the last dose. There\r\nwas no vomiting; diarrhœa was present in about half the number; one of\r\nthe rabbits, being with young, aborted. The chief symptoms were general\r\ndulness, loss of appetite, and in a few days great emaciation. Four of\r\nthe five that died were convulsed before death, and several of the\r\nanimals exhibited ulcers of the mucous membrane of the mouth, in places\r\nwith which the powder had come in contact. Caillol and Livon have also\r\nstudied the action of small doses of the white oxide of antimony given\r\nin milk to cats. A cat took in this way in 109 days ·628 grm. The animal\r\npassed gradually into a cachectic state, diarrhœa supervened, and it\r\ndied miserably thin and exhausted.\r\n\r\n[806] Lever, _Med. Chir. Journ._, No. 1.\r\n\r\n§ 757. =Effects of Tartar Emetic on Man.=[807]--The analogy between the\r\nsymptoms produced by arsenic and antimony is striking, and in some acute\r\ncases of poisoning by tartar emetic, there is but little (if any)\r\nclinical difference. If the dose of tartar emetic is very large, there\r\nmay be complete absence of vomiting, or only a single evacuation of the\r\nstomach. Thus, in a case mentioned by Taylor, in which a veterinary\r\nsurgeon swallowed by mistake 13 grms. (200 grains) of tartar emetic,\r\nvomiting after fifteen minutes could only be induced by tickling the\r\nthroat. So, again, in the case reported by Mr. Freer, a man, aged 28,\r\ntook 7·77 grms. (120 grains) of tartar emetic by mistake for Epsom\r\nsalts; he vomited only once; half an hour after taking the poison he had\r\nviolent pain in the stomach and abdomen, and spasmodic contraction of\r\nthe abdomen and arms; the fingers were firmly contracted, the muscles\r\nquite rigid, and there was involuntary aqueous purging. After six hours,\r\nduring which he was treated with green tea, brandy, and decoction of\r\noak-bark, he began to recover, but suffered for many nights from profuse\r\nperspirations.\r\n\r\n[807] Antimony occasionally finds its way into articles of food through\r\nobscure channels. Dr. Page has recorded the fact of antimonial lozenges\r\nhaving been sold openly by an itinerant vendor of confectionery. Each\r\nlozenge contained nearly a quarter of a grain (·16 mgrms.), and they\r\ncaused well-marked symptoms of poisoning in the case of a servant and\r\ntwo children. How the antimony got in was unknown. In this case it\r\nappears to have existed not as tartar emetic, but as an insoluble oxide,\r\nfor it would not dialyse in aqueous solution.--“On a remarkable instance\r\nof Poisoning by means of Lozenges containing Antimony,” by David Page,\r\nM.D., Medical Officer of Health, _Lancet_, vol. i., 1879, p. 699.\r\n\r\nWith more moderate and yet large doses, nausea and vomiting are very\r\nprominent symptoms, and are seldom delayed more than half an hour. The\r\nregular course of symptoms may therefore be summed up thus:--A metallic\r\ntaste in the mouth, repeated vomitings, which are sometimes bloody,\r\ngreat faintness and depression, pains in the abdomen and stomach, and\r\ndiarrhœa, which may be involuntary. If the case is to terminate fatally,\r\nthe urine is suppressed, the temperature falls, the face becomes\r\ncyanotic, delirium and convulsions supervene, and death occurs in from\r\ntwo to six days. Antimony, like arsenic, often produces a pustular\r\neruption. Solitary cases deviate more or less from the course described,\r\n_i.e._, severe cramps affecting all the muscles, hæmorrhage from the\r\nstomach, kidney, or bowel, and death from collapse in a few hours, have\r\nall been noticed. In a case recorded by Mr. Morley,[808] a surgeon’s\r\ndaughter, aged 18, took by mistake an unknown quantity of antimonial\r\nwine; she soon felt sleepy and powerless, and suffered from the usual\r\nsymptoms in combination with tetanic spasms of the legs. She afterwards\r\nhad enteritis for three weeks, and on recovery her hair fell off. Orfila\r\nrelates a curious case of intense spasm of the gullet from a large dose\r\nof tartar emetic.\r\n\r\n[808] _Brit. Med. Journ._, Oct. 14, p. 70.\r\n\r\n§ 758. =Chronic Antimonial Poisoning.=--The cases of Palmer and J. P.\r\nCook, M. Mullen, Freeman, Winslow, Pritchard, and the remarkable Bravo\r\ncase have, in late years, given the subject of chronic antimonial\r\npoisoning a considerable prominence. In the trials referred to, it was\r\nshown that medical men might easily mistake the effects of small doses\r\nof antimony given at intervals for the action of disease--the symptoms\r\nbeing great nausea, followed by vomiting, chronic diarrhœa, alternating\r\nwith constipation, small frequent pulse, loss of voice, great muscular\r\nweakness, depression, with coldness of the skin and a clammy\r\nperspiration. In the case of Mrs. Pritchard,[809] her face was flushed,\r\nand her manner so excited as to give an ordinary observer the idea that\r\nshe had been drinking; and with the usual symptoms of vomiting and\r\npurging, she suffered from cramps in the hands. Dr. Pritchard tried to\r\nmake it appear that she was suffering from typhoid fever, which the\r\nsymptoms in a few respects only resembled.\r\n\r\n[809] _Edin. Med. Journ._, 1865.\r\n\r\nAccording to Eulenberg, workmen, exposed for a long period to the vapour\r\nof the oxide of antimony, suffer pain in the bladder and a burning\r\nsensation in the urethra, and continued inhalation even leads to\r\nimpotence and wasting of the testicles.[810]\r\n\r\n[810] In the first operations of finishing printers’ types, the workmen\r\ninhale a metallic dust, which gives rise to effects similar to lead\r\ncolic; and probably in this case the lead is more active than the\r\nassociated antimony.\r\n\r\n§ 759. =Post-mortem Appearances.=--The effect of large doses of tartar\r\nemetic is mainly concentrated upon the gastro-intestinal mucous\r\nmembrane. There is an example in the museum of University College\r\nHospital of the changes which resulted from the administration of tartar\r\nemetic in the treatment of pneumonia. These are ascribed in the\r\ncatalogue, in part to the local action of the medicine, and in part to\r\nthe extreme prostration of the patient. In the preparation (No. 1052)\r\nthe mucous membrane over the fore border of the epiglottis and adjacent\r\npart of the pharynx has been destroyed by sloughing; the ulceration\r\nextends into the upper part of the œsophagus. About an inch below its\r\ncommencement, the mucous membrane has been entirely removed by sloughing\r\nand ulceration, the circular muscular fibres being exposed. Above the\r\nupper limit of this ulcer, the mucous membrane presents several oval,\r\nelongated, and ulcerated areas, occupied by strips of mucous membrane\r\nwhich have sloughed. In other places, irregular portions of the mucous\r\nmembrane, of a dull ashen-gray colour, have undergone sloughing; the\r\nedges of the sloughing portion are of colours varying from brown to\r\nblack.\r\n\r\nIt is seldom that so much change is seen in the gullet and pharynx as\r\nthis museum preparation exhibits; but redness, swelling, and the\r\ngeneral signs of inflammation are seldom absent from the stomach and\r\nsome parts of the intestines. On the lining membrane of the mouth,\r\nulcers and pustules have been observed.\r\n\r\nIn Dr. Nevin’s experiments on the chronic poisoning of rabbits already\r\nreferred to, the _post-mortem_ appearances consisted in congestion of\r\nthe liver in all the rabbits; in nearly all there was vivid redness of\r\nthe stomach; in two cases there was ulceration; in some, cartilaginous\r\nhardness of the pylorus; while, in others, the small intestines\r\npresented patches of inflammation. In two of the rabbits the solitary\r\nglands throughout the intestines were prominent, yellow in colour, and\r\nloaded with antimony. The colon and rectum were healthy, the kidneys\r\ncongested; the lungs were in most congested, in some actually inflamed,\r\nor hepatised and gorged with blood. Bloody extravasations in the chest\r\nand abdomen were frequent.\r\n\r\nSaikowsky,[811] in feeding animals daily with antimony, found invariably\r\nin the course of fourteen to nineteen days fatty degeneration of the\r\nliver, and sometimes of the kidney and heart. In the experiment of\r\nCaillol and Livon also all the organs were pale, the liver had undergone\r\nfatty degeneration, and the lung had its alveoli filled with large\r\ndegenerated cells, consisting almost entirely of fat. The mesenteric\r\nglands also formed large caseous masses, yellowish-white in colour,\r\nwhich, under the microscope, were seen to be composed of fatty cells, so\r\nthat there is a complete analogy between the action of arsenic and\r\nantimony on the body tissues.\r\n\r\n[811] Virchow’s _Arch. f. path. Anat._, Bd. xxv.; also, _Centralblatt f.\r\nMed. Wissen._, No. 23, 1865.\r\n\r\n§ 760. =Elimination of Antimony.=--Antimony is mainly eliminated by the\r\nurine. In 1840, Orfila showed to the _Académie de Médecine_ metallic\r\nantimony, which he had extracted from a patient who had taken ·12 grm.\r\nof tartar emetic in twenty-four hours. He also obtained antimony from an\r\nold woman, aged 80, who twelve hours before had taken ·6 grm. (9¼\r\ngrains)--a large dose, which had neither produced vomiting nor purging.\r\nIn Dr. Kevin’s experiments on rabbits, antimony was discovered in the\r\nurine after the twelfth dose, and even in the urine of an animal\r\ntwenty-one days after the administration of the poison had been\r\nsuspended.\r\n\r\n§ 761. =Antidotes for Tartar Emetic.=--Any infusion containing tannin or\r\nallied astringent principles, such as decoctions of tea, oak-bark, &c.,\r\nmay be given with advantage in cases of recent poisoning by tartar\r\nemetic, for any of the salt which has been expelled by vomiting may in\r\nthis way be decomposed and rendered harmless. The treatment of acute\r\npoisoning which has proved most successful, has been the encouraging of\r\nvomiting by tickling the fauces, giving strong green tea and stimulants.\r\n(See Appendix.)\r\n\r\n§ 762. =Effects of Chloride or Butter of Antimony.=--Only a few cases of\r\npoisoning by butter of antimony are on record: its action, generally\r\nspeaking, on the tissues is like that of an acid, but there has been\r\nconsiderable variety in the symptoms. Five cases are recorded by Taylor;\r\nthree of the number recovered after taking respectively doses of 7·7\r\ngrms. (2 drachms) and 15·5 grms. (4 drachms), and two died after taking\r\nfrom 56·6 to 113 grms. (2 to 4 ounces). In one of these cases the\r\nsymptoms were more like those of a narcotic poison, in the other fatal\r\ncase there was abundant vomiting with purging. The autopsy in the first\r\ncase showed a black appearance from the mouth to the jejunum, as if the\r\nparts had been charred, and extensive destruction of the mucous\r\nmembrane. In the other case there were similar changes in the stomach\r\nand the upper part of the intestines, but neither the lips nor the lower\r\nend of the gullet were eroded. In a case recorded by Mr. Barrington\r\nCooke,[812] a farmer’s wife, aged 40, of unsound mind, managed to elude\r\nthe watchfulness of her friends, and swallowed an unknown quantity of\r\nantimony chloride about 1.30 P.M. Shortly afterwards she vomited several\r\ntimes, and had diarrhœa; at 2.30 a medical man found her lying on her\r\nback insensible, and very livid in the face and neck. She was retching,\r\nand emitting from her mouth a frothy mucous fluid, mixed with ejected\r\nmatter of a grumous colour; the breathing was laboured and spasmodic;\r\nthe pulse could not be felt, and the body was cold and clammy. She\r\nexpired at 3.30, about one hour and a half from the commencement of\r\nsymptoms, and probably within two hours from the taking of the poison.\r\nThe autopsy showed no corrugation of the tongue or inner surface of the\r\nlining membrane of the mouth, and no appearance of the action of a\r\ncorrosive upon the lips, fauces, or mucous membrane of the œsophagus.\r\nThe whole of the mucous membrane of the stomach was intensely congested,\r\nof a dark and almost black colour, the rest of the viscera were healthy.\r\nChemical analysis separated antimony equivalent to nearly a grm. (15\r\ngrains) of the chloride, with a small quantity of arsenic, from the\r\ncontents of the stomach.\r\n\r\n[812] _Lancet_, May 19, 1883.\r\n\r\n§ 763. =Detection of Antimony in Organic Matters.=--In acute poisoning\r\nby tartar emetic it is not impossible to find a mere trace only in the\r\nstomach, the greater part having been expelled by vomiting, which nearly\r\nalways occurs early, so that the most certain method is, where possible,\r\nto analyse the ejected matters. If it should be suspected that a living\r\nperson is being slowly poisoned by antimony, it must be remembered that\r\nthe poison is mainly excreted by the kidneys, and the urine should\r\nafford some indication. The readiest way to test is to collect a\r\nconsiderable quantity of the urine (if necessary, two or three days’\r\nexcretion), concentrate by evaporation, acidify, and then transfer the\r\nliquid to a platinum dish, in which is placed a slip of zinc. The whole\r\nof the antimony is in time deposited on the platinum dish, and being\r\nthus concentrated, may be subsequently identified in any way thought\r\nfit.\r\n\r\nOrganic liquids are boiled with hydrochloric acid; organic solids are\r\nextracted with the same acid in the manner described (p. 51); or, if the\r\ndistillation process given at p. 576 be employed, the antimony may be\r\nfound partly in the distillate, and partly in the retort. In any case,\r\nantimony in solution may be readily detected in a variety of ways--one\r\nof the most convenient being to concentrate on tin or platinum, to\r\ndissolve out the antimonial film by sulphide of ammonium, and thus\r\nproduce the very characteristic orange sulphide.\r\n\r\nIf a slip of pure tinfoil be suspended for six hours in a solution,\r\nwhich should not contain more than one-tenth of its bulk of ClH, and\r\nexhibit no stain or deposit, it is certain that antimony cannot be\r\npresent. It may also conveniently be deposited on a platinum dish,[813]\r\nby filling the same with the liquid properly acidulated, and inserting a\r\nrod of zinc; the metallic antimony can afterwards be washed, dried, and\r\nweighed.\r\n\r\n[813] According to Fresenius (_Zeitschr. f. anal. Chem._, i. 445), a\r\nsolution which contains 1/10000 of its weight of antimony, treated in\r\nthis way, gives in two minutes a brown stain, and in ten a very notable\r\nand strong dark brown film. When in the proportion of 1 to 20,000, the\r\nreaction begins to be certain after a quarter of an hour; with greater\r\ndilution it requires longer time, 1 to 40,000 giving a doubtful\r\nreaction, and 1 to 50,000 not responding at all to this test.\r\n\r\nReinsch’s and Marsh’s tests have been already described (pp. 558 and\r\n559), and require no further notice. There is, however, a very beautiful\r\nand delicate means of detecting antimony, which should not be omitted.\r\nIt is based upon the action of stibine (SbH₃) on sulphur.[814] When this\r\ngas is passed over sulphur, it is decomposed according to equation,\r\n2SbH₃ + 6S = Sb₂S₃ + 3SH₂, the action taking place slowly in diffused\r\ndaylight, but very rapidly in sunshine. An ordinary flask for the\r\nevolution of hydrogen (either by galvanic processes or from zinc and\r\nsulphuric acid), with its funnel and drying-tubes, is connected with a\r\nnarrow tube having a few fragments of sulphur, kept in place by plugs of\r\ncotton wool. The whole apparatus is placed in sunshine; if no orange\r\ncolour is produced when the hydrogen has been passing for some time, the\r\nliquid to be tested is poured in gradually through the funnel, and if\r\nantimony should be present, the sulphur acquires a deep orange colour.\r\nThis is distinct even when so small a quantity as ·0001 grain has been\r\nadded through the funnel. The sulphide of antimony thus mixed with\r\nsulphur can, if it is thought necessary, be freed from the sulphur by\r\nrepeated exhaustion with bisulphide of carbon. The stibine does not,\r\nhowever, represent all the antimony introduced, a very large proportion\r\nremaining in the evolution flask;[815] hence it cannot be employed for\r\nquantitative purposes. Moreover, the test can, of course, only be\r\nconveniently applied on sunny days, and is, therefore, in England more\r\nadapted for summer.[816] Often, however, as mentioned elsewhere, when\r\nthe analyst has no clue whatever to the nature of the poison, it is\r\nconvenient to pass SH₂ in the liquid to saturation.[817] In such a case,\r\nif antimony is present (either alone or in combination with other\r\nsulphides), it remains on the filter, and must be separated and\r\nidentified as follows:--The sulphides are first treated with a solution\r\nof carbonate of ammonia, which will dissolve arsenic, if present, and\r\nnext saturated _in situ_ with pure sulphide of sodium, which will\r\ndissolve out sulphide of antimony, if present. The sulphide of antimony\r\nwill present the chemical characters already described, more\r\nparticularly--\r\n\r\n[814] See Ernest Jones on “Stibine,” _Journ. Chem. Soc._, vol. i., 1876.\r\n\r\n[815] Rieckter, _Jahresbericht_, 1865, p. 255.\r\n\r\n[816] The action of salts of cæsium with chloride of antimony might be\r\nused as a test for the latter. A salt of cæsium gives a white\r\nprecipitate with chloride of antimony in concentrated ClH; it contains\r\n30·531 per cent. of antimony, and corresponds to the formula SbCl₃CsCl.\r\nChloride of tin acts similarly.--E. Godeffroy, _Berichte der deutschen\r\nChem. Gesellschaft_, Berlin, 1874.\r\n\r\n[817] The solution must not be too acid.\r\n\r\n(1) It will evolve SH₂ when treated with HCl, and at the same time pass\r\ninto solution.[818]\r\n\r\n[818] By adding chloride of tin to a solution of chloride of antimony in\r\nsufficient quantity, and passing SO₂ through the liquid, the whole of\r\nthe antimony can be thrown down as sulphide, whilst the tin remains in\r\nsolution. Thus,--\r\n\r\n  9SnCl₂ + 2SbCl₃ + 3SO₂ + 12ClH = Sb₂S₃ + 9SnCl₄ + 6OH₂.\r\n\r\n--Federow, _Zeitschrift für Chemie_, 1869, p. 16.\r\n\r\n(2) The solution evaporated to get rid of free HCl gives with water a\r\nthick cheesy precipitate of basic chloride of antimony. This may be seen\r\nif only a drop or two of the solution be taken and tested in a\r\nwatch-glass.\r\n\r\n(3) If tartaric acid be added to the solution, this precipitation does\r\nnot occur.\r\n\r\n(4) The solution from (3) gives an orange precipitate with SH₂.\r\n\r\nSuch a substance can only be sulphide of antimony. With regard to (2),\r\nbismuth would act similarly, but under the circumstances could not be\r\npresent, for the sulphide of bismuth is insoluble in sodic sulphide.\r\n\r\n§ 764. =Quantitative Estimation.=--The quantitative estimation of\r\nantimony is best made by some volumetric process, _e.g._, the sulphide\r\ncan be dissolved in HCl, some tartrate of soda added, and then carbonate\r\nof soda to weak alkaline reaction. The strength of the solution of\r\ntartarised antimony thus obtained can now be estimated by a decinormal\r\nsolution of iodine, the end reaction being indicated by the previous\r\naddition of a little starch solution, or by a solution of permanganate\r\nof potash, either of which should be standardised by the aid of a\r\nsolution of tartar emetic of known strength.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. CADMIUM.\r\n\r\n    § 765. =Cadmium=, Cd = 112; specific gravity, 8·6 to 8·69;\r\n    fusing-point, 227·8° (442° F.); boiling-point, 860° (1580°\r\n    F.).--Cadmium in analysis is seldom separated as a metal, but is\r\n    estimated either as oxide or sulphide.\r\n\r\n    § 766. =Cadmium Oxide=, CdO = 128--cadmium, 87·5 per cent.; oxygen,\r\n    12·5 per cent.--is a yellowish or reddish-brown powder, non-volatile\r\n    even at a white heat; insoluble in water, but dissolving in acids.\r\n    Ignited on charcoal, it is reduced to metal, which volatilises, and\r\n    is then deposited again as oxide, giving to the coal a distinct coat\r\n    of an orange-yellow colour in very thin layers; in thicker layers,\r\n    brown.\r\n\r\n    § 767. =Cadmium Sulphide=, CdS = 144--Cd, 77·7 per cent.; S, 22·3\r\n    per cent.--known as a mineral termed Greenockite. When prepared in\r\n    the wet way, it is a lemon-yellow powder, which cannot be ignited in\r\n    hydrogen without loss, and is insoluble in water, dilute acids,\r\n    alkalies, alkaline sulphides, sulphate of soda, and cyanide of\r\n    potassium. The solution must not contain too much hydrochloric acid,\r\n    for the sulphide is readily soluble with separation of sulphur in\r\n    concentrated hydrochloric acid. It may be dried in the ordinary way\r\n    at 100° without suffering any decomposition.\r\n\r\n    § 768. =Medicinal Preparations.=--_The Iodide of Cadmium_ (CdI₂)\r\n    occurs in white, flat, micaceous crystals, melting at about 215·5°\r\n    (419·9° F.), and at a dull red heat giving off violet vapour. In\r\n    solution, the salt gives the reactions of iodine and cadmium. The\r\n    ointment of iodide of cadmium (_Unguentum cadmii iodidi_) contains\r\n    the iodide in the proportion of 62 grains to the ounce, or 14 per\r\n    cent.\r\n\r\n    =Cadmium Sulphate= is officinal in the Belgian, Portuguese, and\r\n    French pharmacopœias.\r\n\r\n    § 769. =Cadmium in the Arts, &c.=--Cadmium is used in various\r\n    alloys. The sulphide is found as a colouring ingredient in certain\r\n    toilet soaps, and it is much valued by artists as a pigment. The\r\n    iodide of cadmium is employed in photography, and an amalgam of\r\n    metallic cadmium to some extent in dentistry.\r\n\r\n    § 770. =Fatal Dose of Cadmium.=--Although no deaths from the use of\r\n    cadmium appear to have as yet occurred, its use in photography, &c.,\r\n    may lead to accidents. There can be no question about the poisonous\r\n    action of cadmium, for Marmé,[819] in his experiments on it with\r\n    animals, observed giddiness, vomiting, syncope, difficulty in\r\n    respiration, loss of consciousness, and cramps. The amount necessary\r\n    to destroy life can only be gathered from the experiments on\r\n    animals. A strong hound died after the injection of ·03 grm. (·462\r\n    grain) subcutaneously of a salt of cadmium; rabbits are poisoned if\r\n    from 19·4 to 38·8 mgrms. (·3 to ·6 grain) are introduced into the\r\n    stomach. A watery solution of ·5 grm. (7·5 grains) of the bromide\r\n    administered to a pigeon caused instant death, without convulsion;\r\n    the same dose of the chloride killed a second pigeon in six minutes;\r\n    ·25 grm. (3·85 grains) of sulphite of cadmium administered to a\r\n    pigeon excited vomiting, and after two hours diarrhœa; it died in\r\n    eight days. Another pigeon died from a similar dose in fourteen\r\n    days, and cadmium, on analysis, was separated from the liver. From\r\n    the above cases it would seem probable that 4 grms. (61·7 grains)\r\n    would be a _dangerous_ dose of a soluble salt of cadmium for an\r\n    adult, and that in a case of chronic poisoning it would most\r\n    probably be found in the liver.\r\n\r\n[819] _Zeitschr. f. rationelle Med._, vol. xxix. p. 1, 1867.\r\n\r\n    § 771. =Separation and Detection of Cadmium.=--If cadmium be in\r\n    solution, and the solution is not too acid, on the addition of SH₂\r\n    there is precipitated a yellow sulphide, which is distinguished\r\n    from antimony and arsenical sulphides by its insolubility in ammonia\r\n    and alkaline sulphides. Should all three sulphides be on the filter\r\n    (an occurrence which will seldom, perhaps never, happen), the\r\n    sulphide of arsenic can be dissolved out by ammonia, the antimony by\r\n    sulphide of sodium, leaving the sulphide of cadmium as the\r\n    residue.[820]\r\n\r\n[820] It is unnecessary to state that absence of sulphur is presupposed.\r\n\r\n    The further tests of the sulphide are:--\r\n\r\n    (1) It dissolves in dilute nitric acid to a colourless fluid, with\r\n    separation of sulphur.\r\n\r\n    (2) The solution, filtered and freed from excess of nitric acid by\r\n    evaporation, gives with a solution of ammonic carbonate a white\r\n    precipitate of carbonate of cadmium insoluble in excess. This\r\n    distinguishes it from zinc, which gives a similar white precipitate,\r\n    but is soluble in the excess of the precipitant.\r\n\r\n    (3) The carbonate thus obtained, heated on platinum foil, is changed\r\n    into the brown-red non-volatile oxide.\r\n\r\n    (4) The oxide behaves on charcoal as already detailed.\r\n\r\n    (5) A metallic portion can be obtained by melting the oxide with\r\n    cyanide of potassium; it is between zinc and tin in brilliancy, and\r\n    makes a mark on paper like lead, but not so readily. There are many\r\n    other tests, but the above are conclusive.\r\n\r\n    If cadmium in any case be specially searched for in the organs or\r\n    tissues, the latter should be boiled with nitric acid. The acid\r\n    solution is filtered, saturated with caustic potash, evaporated to\r\n    dryness, and ignited; the residue is dissolved in dilute\r\n    hydrochloric acid, and treated after filtration with SH₂. Cadmium\r\n    may also be estimated volumetrically by digesting the sulphide in a\r\n    stoppered flask with ferric chloride and hydrochloric acid; the\r\n    resulting ferrous compound is titrated with permanganate, each c.c.\r\n    of a d.n. solution of permanganate = ·0056 grm. of cadmium.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--PRECIPITATED BY HYDRIC SULPHIDE IN HYDROCHLORIC ACID\r\nSOLUTION--BLACK.\r\n\r\nLead--Copper--Bismuth--Silver--Mercury.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. LEAD.\r\n\r\n§ 772. =Lead=, Pb = 207.--Lead is a well-known bluish-white, soft metal;\r\nfusing-point, 325°; specific gravity, 11·36.\r\n\r\n=Oxides of Lead.=--The two oxides of lead necessary to notice here\r\nbriefly are--litharge and minium.\r\n\r\n=Litharge, or Oxide of Lead=, PbO = 223; specific gravity, 9·2 to\r\n9·5--Pb 92·82 per cent., O 7·18--is either in crystalline scales, a\r\nfused mass, or a powder, varying in colour (according to its mode of\r\npreparation) from yellow to reddish-yellow or orange. When prepared\r\nbelow the temperature of fusion it is called “_massicot_.” It may be\r\nfused without alteration in weight; in a state of fusion it dissolves\r\nsilicic acid and silicates of the earths. It must not be fused in\r\nplatinum vessels.\r\n\r\n=Minium, or Red Lead=, 2PbO, PbO₂; specific gravity, 9·08, is a compound\r\nof protoxide of lead with the dioxide. It is of a brilliant red colour,\r\nmuch used in the arts, and especially in the preparation of flint-glass.\r\n\r\n§ 773. =Sulphide of Lead=, PbS = 239; Pb, 86·61 per cent., S, 13·39 per\r\ncent., occurring in the usual way, is a black precipitate insoluble in\r\nwater, dilute acids, alkalies, and alkaline sulphides. It dissolves in\r\nstrong nitric acid with separation of sulphur, and in strong\r\nhydrochloric acid, with evolution of SH₂. Fuming nitric acid does not\r\nseparate sulphur, but converts the sulphide into sulphate.\r\n\r\n§ 774. =Sulphate of Lead=, PbSO₄ = 303; specific gravity, 6·3; PbO,\r\n73·61 per cent., SO₃, 26·39 per cent., when produced artificially is a\r\nheavy white powder, of great insolubility in water, 22,800 parts of cold\r\nwater dissolving only one of lead sulphate; and if the water contains\r\nsulphuric acid, no less than 36,500 parts of water are required. The\r\nsalts of ammonia (especially the acetate and tartrate) dissolve the\r\nsulphate, and it is also soluble in hyposulphite of soda. The sulphate\r\ncan be readily changed into the carbonate of lead, by boiling it with\r\nsolutions of the alkaline carbonates. The sulphate of lead, fused with\r\ncyanide of potassium, yields metallic lead; it may be also reduced on\r\ncharcoal, and alone it may be fused without decomposition, provided\r\nreducing gases are excluded.\r\n\r\n§ 775. =Acetate of Lead=, =Sugar of Lead=, Pb(C₂H₃O₂)₂3OH₂ = 379, is\r\nfound in commerce in white, spongy masses composed of acicular crystals.\r\nIt may, however, be obtained in flat four-sided prisms. It has a sweet\r\nmetallic taste, is soluble in water, and responds to the usual tests for\r\nlead. The P.B. directs that 38 grains dissolved in water require, for\r\ncomplete precipitation, 200 grain measures of the volumetric solution of\r\noxalic acid, corresponding to 22·3 grains of oxide of lead.\r\n\r\n§ 776. =Chloride of Lead=, PbCl₂ = 278; specific gravity, 5·8; Pb, 74·48\r\nper cent., Cl, 25·52 per cent., is in the form of brilliant crystalline\r\nneedles. It is very insoluble in cold water containing hydrochloric or\r\nnitric acids. According to Bischof, 1635 parts of water containing\r\nnitric acid dissolve one part only of chloride of lead. It is insoluble\r\nin absolute alcohol, and sparingly in alcohol of 70 to 80 per cent. It\r\nfuses below red heat without losing weight; at higher temperatures it\r\nmay be decomposed.\r\n\r\n=Carbonate of Lead.=--The commercial carbonate of lead (according to the\r\nexhaustive researches of Wigner and Harland[821]) is composed of a\r\nmixture of neutral carbonate of lead and hydrate of lead, the best\r\nmixture being 25 per cent. of hydrate, corresponding to an actual\r\npercentage of 12·3 per cent. carbonic acid. The nearer the mixture\r\napproximates to this composition the better the paint; whilst samples\r\ncontaining as much as 16·33 per cent., or as little as 10·39 per cent.,\r\nof CO₂ are practically useless.\r\n\r\n[821] “On the Composition of Commercial Samples of White Lead,” by G. W.\r\nWigner and R. H. Harland.--_Analyst_, 1877, p. 208.\r\n\r\n§ 777. =Preparations of Lead used in Medicine, the Arts, &c.=\r\n\r\n(1) =Pharmaceutical=:--\r\n\r\n=Lead Plaster= (_Emplastrum plumbi_) is simply a lead soap, in which the\r\nlead is combined with oleic and margaric acids, and contains some\r\nmechanically included glycerin.\r\n\r\n=Lead Iodide=, PbI₂, is contained in the _Emplastrum plumbi iodidi_ to\r\nthe extent of 10 per cent., and in the _Unguentum plumbi iodidi_ to the\r\nextent of about 12·5 per cent.\r\n\r\n=Acetate of Lead= is contained in a pill, a suppository, and an\r\nointment. The pill (_Pilula plumbi cum opio_) contains 75 per cent. of\r\nlead acetate, and 12·5 per cent. of opium, the rest confection of roses.\r\nThe suppository (_Suppositoria plumbi composita_) contains 20 per cent.\r\nof acetate of lead, and 6·6 per cent. of opium, mixed with oil of\r\ntheobroma. The ointment (_Unguentum plumbi acetatis_) contains 20·6 per\r\ncent. of lead acetate, mixed with benzoated lard.\r\n\r\nThe solution of subacetate of lead (_Liquor plumbi subacetatis_) is the\r\nsubacetate, Pb(C₂H₃O₂)₂PbO, dissolved in water; it contains nearly 27\r\nper cent. of subacetate.\r\n\r\nA dilute solution of the stronger, under the name of _Liquor plumbi\r\nsubacetatis dilutus_, and commonly called Goulard water, is prepared by\r\nmixing 1 part (by volume) of the solution and 1 part of spirit, and 78\r\nparts of distilled water; the strength is equal to 1·25 per cent.\r\n\r\nThere is an ointment, called the _Compound Ointment of subacetate of\r\nlead_, which contains the subacetate in about the proportion of 2 per\r\ncent. of the oxide, the other constituents being camphor, white wax, and\r\nalmond oil.\r\n\r\n=Carbonate of Lead.=--The ointment (_Unguentum plumbi carbonatis_)\r\nshould contain about 12·5 per cent. of the carbonate, and the rest\r\nsimple ointment.\r\n\r\n    (2) =Quack Nostrums, &c.=:--\r\n\r\n    The quack medicines composed of lead are not very numerous.\r\n\r\n    Liebert’s =Cosmetique Infaillible= is said to have for its basis\r\n    nitrate of lead.\r\n\r\n    One of “=Ali Ahmed’s Treasures of the Desert=,” viz., the antiseptic\r\n    malagma, is a plaster made up of lead plaster 37·5 per cent.,\r\n    frankincense 25 per cent., salad oil 25 per cent., beeswax 12·5 per\r\n    cent.\r\n\r\n    =Lewis’ Silver Cream= contains white precipitate and a salt of lead.\r\n\r\n    =Goulard’s Balsam= is made by triturating acetate of lead with hot\r\n    oil of turpentine.\r\n\r\n    There are various ointments in use made up of litharge. Some\r\n    herbalists in the country (from cases that have come under the\r\n    writer’s own knowledge) apply to cancerous ulcers, &c., a liniment\r\n    of linseed and other common oils mixed with litharge and acetate of\r\n    lead.\r\n\r\n    Acetate of lead may also be found as a constituent of various\r\n    eye-waters.\r\n\r\n    (3) =Preparations of Lead used in the Arts, &c.=:--\r\n\r\n    =Ledoyen’s Disinfecting Fluid= has for its basis nitrate of lead.\r\n\r\n    In various hair-dyes the following are all used:--Litharge, lime,\r\n    and starch; lime and carbonate of lead; lime and acetate of lead;\r\n    litharge, lime, and potassic bicarbonate. The detection of lead in\r\n    the hair thus treated is extremely easy; it may be dissolved out by\r\n    dilute nitric acid.\r\n\r\n    =Lead Pigments.=--The principal pigments of lead are white, yellow,\r\n    and red.\r\n\r\n    =White Pigments=:--\r\n\r\n    =White Lead=, =Flake White Ceruse=, =Mineral White=, are so many\r\n    different names for the carbonate of lead already described.\r\n\r\n    =Newcastle White= is white lead made with molasses vinegar.\r\n\r\n    =Nottingham White.=--White lead made with alegar (sour ale), often,\r\n    however, replaced by permanent white, _i.e._, sulphate of baryta.\r\n\r\n    =Miniature Painters’ White=, =White Precipitate of Lead=, is simply\r\n    lead sulphate.\r\n\r\n    =Pattison’s White= is an oxychloride of lead, PbCl₂PbO.\r\n\r\n    =Yellow Pigments=:--\r\n\r\n    =Chrome Yellow= may be a fairly pure chromate of lead, or it may be\r\n    mixed with sulphates of lead, barium, and calcium. The pigment known\r\n    as “Cologne yellow” consists of 25 parts of lead chromate, 15 of\r\n    lead sulphate, and 60 of calcic sulphate. The easiest method of\r\n    analysing chrome yellow is to extract with boiling hydrochloric acid\r\n    in the presence of alcohol, which dissolves the chromium as\r\n    chloride, and leaves undissolved chloride of lead, sulphate of lead,\r\n    and other substances insoluble in ClH. Every grain of chromate of\r\n    lead should yield 0·24 grain of oxide of chromium, and 0·4 grain of\r\n    chloride of lead.\r\n\r\n    =Turner’s Yellow=, =Cassella Yellow=, =Patent Yellow=, is an\r\n    oxychloride of lead (PbCl₂7PbO) extremely fusible.\r\n\r\n    =Dutch Pink= sometimes contains white lead.\r\n\r\n    =Red Pigments=:--\r\n\r\n    =Chrome Red= is a bichromate of lead.\r\n\r\n    =Red Lead= or =Minium= is the red oxide of lead.\r\n\r\n    =Orange Red= is an oxide prepared by calcining the carbonate.\r\n\r\n    The chief preparations of lead which may be met with in the arts, in\r\n    addition to the oxides and the carbonate, are--\r\n\r\n    The =Nitrate of Lead=, much used in calico-printing.\r\n\r\n    The =Pyrolignite of Lead=, which is an impure acetate used in\r\n    dyeing; and\r\n\r\n    The =Sulphate of Lead= is a by-product in the preparation of acetate\r\n    of aluminium for dyeing.\r\n\r\n    The alloys containing lead are extremely numerous; but, according to\r\n    the experiments of Knapp,[822] the small quantity of lead in those\r\n    used for household purposes has no hygienic importance.\r\n\r\n[822] _Dingl. Polytech.

In the treatment of cases of\r\nlead-poisoning, the flowers of sulphur given internally appear to be\r\nsuccessful.[824]\r\n\r\n[823] Eulenberg, _Gewerbe Hygiene_, p. 712.\r\n\r\n[824] Mohr’s _Toxicologie_, p. 78.\r\n\r\nLead-poisoning, either in its obscure form (producing uric acid in the\r\nblood, and, as a consequence, indigestion and other evils), or in the\r\nacute form (as lead colic and various nervous affections), is most\r\nfrequent among those who are habitually exposed to the influence of the\r\nmetal in its different preparations, viz., workers of lead,\r\nhouse-painters, artists, gilders, workers of arsenic, workers of gold,\r\ncalico-printers, colourists, type-founders, type-setters, shot-founders,\r\npotters, faience makers, braziers, and many others.[825] In white-lead\r\nfactories so large a number of the employés suffer from poisoning that\r\nit has excited more than once the attention of the Government.[826]\r\n\r\n[825] The attention which the use of lead in the arts has always excited\r\nis evident from the fact that one of the oldest works on Trade Hygiene\r\n(by Stockhausen) is entitled, _De lithargyrii fumo noxio, morbifico\r\nejusque metallico frequentiori morbo vulgo dicto hüttenkatze_, Gaslar,\r\n1556.\r\n\r\n[826] A departmental committee, appointed to inquire into the white lead\r\nand allied industries, in a report presented to the Home Secretary\r\nstated:--\r\n\r\n“8. (_a_) It is known that if lead (in any form), even in what may be\r\ncalled infinitesimal quantities, gains entrance into the system for a\r\nlengthened period, by such channels as the stomach, by swallowing lead\r\ndust in the saliva, or through the medium of food and drink; by the\r\nrespiratory organs, as by the inhalation of dust; or through the skin;\r\nthere is developed a series of symptoms, the most frequent of which is\r\ncolic. Nearly all the individuals engaged in factories where lead or its\r\ncompounds are manipulated look pale, and it is this bloodlessness and\r\nthe presence of a blue line along the margin of the gums, close to the\r\nteeth, that herald the other symptoms of plumbism. (_b_) A form of\r\nparalysis known as wrist-drop or lead-palsy occasionally affects the\r\nhands of the operatives. There is, in addition, a form of acute\r\nlead-poisoning, most frequently met with in young girls from 18 to 24\r\nyears of age, which is suddenly developed and is extremely fatal. In it\r\nthe first complaint is headache, followed sooner or later by convulsions\r\nand unconsciousness. Death often terminates such a case within three\r\ndays. In some cases of recovery from convulsions total blindness\r\nremains.\r\n\r\n“9. There has been considerable doubt as to the channels by which the\r\npoison enters the system. The committee have taken much evidence on this\r\nsubject, and have arrived at the conclusion (_a_) that carbonate of lead\r\nmay be absorbed through the pores of the skin, and that the chance of\r\nthis is much increased during perspiration and where there is any\r\nfriction between the skin and the clothing; (_b_) that minute portions\r\nof lead are carried by the hands, under and round the nails, &c., on to\r\nthe food, and so into the stomach; (_c_) but that the most usual manner\r\nis by the inhalation of lead dust. Some of this becomes dissolved in the\r\nalkaline secretions of the mouth, and is swallowed by the saliva, thus\r\nfinding its way to the stomach. Other particles of dust are carried to\r\nthe lungs, where they are rendered soluble and absorbed by the\r\nblood.”--_Report of Chief Inspector of Factories for 1893._\r\n\r\nLead, again, has been found by the analyst in most of the ordinary\r\nfoods, such as flour, bread, beer, cider, wines, spirits, tea, vinegar,\r\nsugar, confectionery, &c., as well as in numerous drugs, especially\r\nthose manufactured by the aid of sulphuric acid (the latter nearly\r\nalways containing lead), and those salts or chemical products which\r\n(like citric and tartaric acids) are crystallised in leaden pans. Hence\r\nit follows that in almost everything eaten or drunk the analyst, as a\r\nmatter of routine, tests for lead. The channels through which it may\r\nenter into the system are, however, so perfectly familiar to practical\r\nchemists, that a few _unusual_ instances of lead-poisoning only need be\r\nquoted here.\r\n\r\nA cabman suffered from lead colic, traced to his taking the first glass\r\nof beer every morning at a certain public-house; the beer standing in\r\nthe pipes all night, as proved by analysis, was strongly impregnated\r\nwith lead.[827]\r\n\r\n[827] _Chem. News._\r\n\r\nThe employment of red lead for repairing the joints of steam pipes has\r\nbefore now caused poisonous symptoms from volatilisation of lead.[828]\r\nThe use of old painted wood in a baker’s oven, and subsequent adherence\r\nof the oxide of lead to the outside of the loaves, has caused the\r\nillness of sixty-six people.[829]\r\n\r\n[828] Eulenberg, _Op. cit._, p. 708.\r\n\r\n[829] _Annales d’Hygiène._\r\n\r\nSeven persons became affected with lead-poisoning through horse-hair\r\ncoloured with lead.[830]\r\n\r\n[830] Hitzig, _Studien über Bleivergiftung_.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of _American overland cloth_ creates a white-lead dust,\r\nwhich has caused serious symptoms among the workmen (_Dr. G. Johnson_).\r\nThe cleaning of pewter pots,[831] the handling of vulcanised\r\nrubber,[832] the wrapping up of various foods in tinfoil,[833] and the\r\nfingering of lead counters covered with brine by fishmongers, have all\r\ncaused accidents in men.\r\n\r\n[831] _Med.

Jurisprud._, i.\r\n\r\nThe lead in glass, though in the form of an insoluble silicate, is said\r\nto have been dissolved by vinegar and other acid fluids to a dangerous\r\nextent. This, however, is hardly well established.[834]\r\n\r\n[834] See _Aerztl. Intelligenzbl. f. Baiern_, Jahrg., 1869; _Buchner’s\r\nRep. Pharm._, Bd. xix. p. 1; _Med. Centrbl._, Jahrg., 1869, p. 40.\r\n\r\n§ 780. =Effects of Lead Compounds on Animals.=--Orfila and the older\r\nschool of toxicologists made a number of experiments on the action of\r\nsugar of lead and other compounds, but they are of little value for\r\nelucidating the physiological or toxic action of lead, because they\r\nwere, for the most part, made under unnatural conditions, the gullet\r\nbeing ligatured to avoid expulsion of the salt by vomiting. Harnack, in\r\norder to avoid the local and corrosive effects of sugar of lead, used an\r\norganic compound, viz., plumbic triethyl acetate, which has no local\r\naction. Frogs exhibited symptoms after subcutaneous doses of from 2 to\r\n3 mgrms., rabbits after 40 mgrms.; there was increased peristaltic\r\naction of the intestines, with spasmodic contraction rising to colic,\r\nvery often diarrhœa, and death followed through heart paralysis. Dogs\r\ngiven the ethyl compound exhibited nervous symptoms like chorea.\r\nGusserno[835] has also made experiments on animals as to the effects of\r\nlead, using lead phosphate, and giving from 1·2 grm. to a rabbit and a\r\ndog daily. Rosenstein[836] and Heubel[837] used small doses of acetate,\r\nthe latter giving dogs daily from ·2 to ·5 grm. The results arrived at\r\nby Gusserno were, mainly, that the animals became emaciated, shivered,\r\nand had some paralysis of the hinder extremities; while Rosenstein\r\nobserved towards the end epileptiform convulsions, and Heubel alone saw,\r\nin a few of his cases, colic. A considerable number of cattle have been\r\npoisoned from time to time with lead, and one instance of this fell\r\nunder my own observation. A pasture had been manured with refuse from a\r\nplumber’s yard, and pieces of paint were in this way strewn about the\r\nfield in every direction; a herd of fifteen young cattle were placed in\r\nthe field, and in two or three days they all, without exception, began\r\nrapidly to lose condition, and to show peculiar symptoms--diarrhœa, loss\r\nof appetite; in two, blindness, the retina presenting an appearance not\r\nunlike that seen in Bright’s disease; in three, a sort of delirium. Four\r\ndied, and showed on _post-mortem_ examination granular conditions of the\r\nkidneys, which was the most striking change observable. In the fatal\r\ncases, paralysis of the hind extremities, coma, and convulsions preceded\r\ndeath. In another case[838] seven cows and a bull died from eating lead\r\npaint; the symptoms were loss of appetite, obstinate constipation,\r\nsuspension of rumination, dry muffle, quick breathing, and coma. In\r\nother cases a marked symptom has been paralysis. Cattle[839] have also\r\nseveral times been poisoned from eating grass which has been splashed by\r\nthe spray from bullets, as in pastures in the vicinity of rifle butts;\r\nhere we must allow that the intestinal juices have dissolved the metal,\r\nand transformed it into compounds capable of being taken into the\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n[835] Virchow’s _Archiv. f. path.

With regard to the common acetate, it would seem\r\nthat a large single dose is less likely to destroy life than smaller\r\nquantities given in divided doses for a considerable period. The\r\nsymptoms produced by a considerable dose of sugar of lead usually\r\ncommence within a few minutes; there is immediately a metallic taste,\r\nwith burning, and a sensation of great dryness in the mouth and throat;\r\nvomiting, which occurs usually within fifteen minutes, is in very rare\r\ncases delayed from one to two hours. The retching and vomiting are very\r\nobstinate, and continue for a long time; the matters thrown up are\r\nsometimes streaked with blood; there is pain in the abdomen of a colicky\r\ncharacter--a pain relieved by pressure. The bowels are, as a rule,\r\nconstipated, but occasionally relaxed. The stools at a later date are\r\nblack from the presence of lead sulphide. The urine, as a rule, is\r\ndiminished. The breath has a foul odour, and the tongue is coated; the\r\nskin is dry, and the pulse small and frequent. The full development of\r\nthe toxic action is completed by the appearance of various nervous\r\nphenomena--headache, shooting pains in the limbs, cramps in the legs,\r\nand local numbness. All the symptoms enumerated are not present in each\r\ncase; the most constant are the vomiting and the colic. If the sufferer\r\nis to die, death occurs about the second or third day. If the patient\r\nrecovers, convalescence may be much retarded, as shown in the case of\r\ntwo girls,[840] who had each swallowed an ounce of lead acetate by\r\nmistake, and who suffered even after the lapse of a year from pain and\r\ntenderness in the stomach and sickness.\r\n\r\n[840] Prov. _Med. Journal_, 1846.\r\n\r\nThere are “mass-poisonings” by acetate of lead on record, which afford\r\nconsiderable insight into the varying action of this salt on different\r\nindividuals. A case (_e.g._) occurred at Stourbridge in 1840,[841] in\r\nwhich no less than 500 people were poisoned by thirty pounds of lead\r\nacetate being accidentally mixed with eighty sacks of flour at a\r\nmiller’s. The symptoms commenced after a few days; constriction of the\r\nthroat, cramping and twisting pains round the umbilicus, rigidity of the\r\nabdominal muscles, dragging pains at the loins, cramps and paralysis of\r\nthe lower extremities. There was obstinate constipation; the urine was\r\nscanty and of a deep red colour, and the secretions were generally\r\narrested; the pulse was slow and feeble; the countenance depressed,\r\noften livid; and the gums showed the usual blue line. The temperature of\r\nthe skin was low. In only a few cases was there sickness, and in these\r\nit soon ceased. It is curious that not one of the 500 cases proved\r\nfatal, although some of the victims were extremely ill, and their\r\ncondition alarming. It was specially observed that, after apparent\r\nconvalescence, the symptoms, without any obvious cause, suddenly\r\nreturned, and this even in a more aggravated form. Remittance of this\r\nkind is of medico-legal import; it might, for example, be wrongly\r\ninferred that a fresh dose had been taken. In the 500 cases there were\r\nno inflammatory symptoms; complete recovery took some time. On examining\r\nthe bread the poison was found so unequally distributed that no idea\r\ncould be formed as to the actual amount taken.\r\n\r\n[841] Recorded by Mr. Bancks, _Lancet_, May 5, 1849, p. 478.\r\n\r\nThere is also recorded[842] an outbreak of lead-poisoning among 150 men\r\nof the 7th Infantry at Tione, in the Southern Tyrol. One case proved\r\nfatal, forty-five required treatment in hospital. The symptoms were\r\npallor, a blue line in the gums, metallic taste in the mouth, a peculiar\r\nodour of the breath, a loaded tongue with a bluish tint, obstinate\r\nconstipation with loss of appetite whilst all complained, in addition,\r\nof dragging of the limbs and of the muscles of the chest, and difficulty\r\nof breathing. In the severer cases there were tetanic spasms, muscular\r\ntremors, and anæsthesia of the fingers and toes. The pulse and\r\ntemperature were normal, save in a few cases in which there were fever\r\nand sweats at night. _In none was there colic_, but the constipation was\r\nobstinate. In two of the worst cases there was strangury. Acute cases\r\noccur occasionally from poisoning by _the carbonate of lead_. Dr. Snow\r\nrecorded an instance (in 1844) of a child who had eaten a piece as big\r\nas a marble, ground up with oil. For three days the child suffered from\r\npain in the abdomen and vomiting, and died ninety hours after taking the\r\npoison. In another case, in which a young man took from 19 to 20 grms.\r\nof lead carbonate in mistake for chalk as a remedy for heartburn, the\r\nsymptoms of vomiting, pain in the stomach, &c., commenced after a few\r\nhours; but, under treatment with magnesic sulphate, he recovered.\r\n\r\n[842] Königschmied, _Centralbl. Allg. für Gesundheitspflege_, 2 Jahrg.,\r\nHeft 1.\r\n\r\n=The chromate of lead= is still more poisonous (see Art. “Chromium”).\r\n\r\n§ 782. =Chronic Poisoning by Lead.=--Chronic poisoning by lead--often\r\ncaused by strange and unsuspected channels, more frequently an incident,\r\nnay, almost a necessity, of certain trades, and occasionally induced by\r\na cunning criminal for the purpose of simulating natural disease--is of\r\ngreat toxicological and hygienic importance. In the white-lead trade it\r\nis, as might be expected, most frequently witnessed; but also in all\r\noccupations which involve the daily use of lead in almost any shape. The\r\nchief signs of chronic poisoning are those of general ill-health; the\r\ndigestion is disturbed, the appetite lessened, the bowels obstinately\r\nconfined, the skin assumes a peculiar yellowish hue, and sometimes the\r\nsufferer is jaundiced. The gums show a black line from two to three\r\nlines in breadth, which microscopical examination and chemical tests\r\nalike show to be composed of sulphide of lead; occasionally the teeth\r\nturn black.[843] The pulse is slow, and all secretions are diminished.\r\nPregnant women have a tendency to abort. There are also special\r\nsymptoms, one of the most prominent of which is often lead colic.\r\n\r\n[843] The black line soon develops; Masazza has seen it in a dog,\r\nexposed to the influence of lead, in so short a period as three days\r\n(_Riforma med._, 1889, Nos. 248-257, 1).\r\n\r\nIn 142 cases of lead-poisoning, treated between 1852 and 1862 at the\r\nJacob’s Hospital, Leipzig, forty-four patients (or about 31 per cent.)\r\nsuffered from colic. Arthralgia--that is, pains in the joints--is also\r\nvery common; it seldom occurs alone, but in combination with other\r\nsymptoms. Thus, in seventy-five cases of lead-arthralgia treated at\r\nJacob’s Hospital, in only seven were pain in the joints without other\r\ncomplications, fifty-six being accompanied by colic, five by paralysis,\r\nand seven by other affections of the nervous system. The total\r\npercentage of cases of lead-poisoning, in which arthralgia occurs,\r\nvaries from 32 to 57 per cent.\r\n\r\nParalysis, in some form or other, Tanqueril[844] found in 5 to 8 per\r\ncent. of the cases, and noticed that it occurred as early as the third\r\nday after working in lead. The muscles affected are usually those of the\r\nupper extremity, then the legs, and still more rarely the muscles of the\r\ntrunk. It is only exceptionally that the paralysis extends over an\r\nentire limb; it more usually affects a muscular group, or even a single\r\nmuscle. Its common seat is the extensors of the hand and fingers; hence\r\nthe expression “dropped-wrist,” for the hands droop, and occasionally\r\nthe triceps and the deltoid are affected. The paralysis is usually\r\nsymmetrical on both sides. Although the extensors are affected most, the\r\nflexors nearly always participate, and a careful investigation will show\r\nthat they are weakened. If the paralysis continues, there is a wasting\r\nand degeneration of the muscle, but this is seen in paralysis from any\r\ncause. The muscular affection may cause deformities in the hands,\r\nshoulders, &c. Anæsthesia of portions of the skin is generally present\r\nin a greater or less degree. A complete analgesia affecting the whole\r\nbody has been noticed to such an extent that there was absolute\r\ninsensibility to burns or punctures; but it is usually confined to the\r\nright half of the body, and is especially intense in the right hand and\r\nwrist.\r\n\r\n[844] Tanqueril des Planches, _Traité des Maladies de Plomb_, Paris,\r\n1839. Tanqueril’s monograph is a classical work full of information.\r\n\r\n§ 783. The older writers recognised the toxic effect of lead on the\r\nnervous system. Thus Dioscorides speaks of delirium produced by lead,\r\nAretaeus of epilepsy, and Paul of Ægina refers to it as a factor of\r\nepilepsy and convulsions. But in 1830, Tanqueril first definitely\r\ndescribed the production of a mental disease, which he called “_lead\r\nencephalopathy_.” This he divided into four forms--(1) a delirious form;\r\n(2) a comatose; (3) a convulsive; and (4) a combined form, comprising\r\nthe delirious, convulsive, and comatose. Dr. Henry Rayner,[845] and a\r\nfew other English alienists, have directed their attention to this\r\nquestion; and, according to Dr. Rayner’s researches, the number of male\r\npatients admitted into Hanwell Asylum, engaged in trades such as\r\nplumbing, painting, and the like, is larger in proportion to the number\r\nadmitted from other trades than it should be, compared with the\r\nproportion of the various trades in the county of Middlesex, as\r\nascertained from the census. Putting aside coarse lead-poisoning, which\r\nmay occasionally produce acute mania, the insanity produced by prolonged\r\nminute lead intoxications possesses some peculiar features. It develops\r\nslowly, and in nearly all cases there are illusions of the senses, of\r\nhearing, taste, or smell, and especially of sight. Thus, in one of Dr.\r\nRayner’s cases the patient saw round him “wind-bags blown out to look\r\nlike men,” apparitions which made remarks to him, and generally worried\r\nhim. Besides this form, there is also another which closely resembles\r\ngeneral paralysis, and, in the absence of the history, might be mistaken\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\n[845] See an important paper, “Insanity from Lead-Poisoning,” by Drs. H.\r\nRayner, Robertson, Savage, and Atkins, _Journ. of Mental Science_, vol.\r\nxxvi. p. 222; also a paper by Dr. Barton, _Allgemeine Zeitschrift für\r\nPsychiatrie_, Bd. xxxvij. H. 4, p. 9.\r\n\r\n§ 784. The degenerative influence on the organ of sight is shown in six\r\nof Dr. Robertson’s patients, whose insanity was ascribed to lead--four\r\nof the six were either totally or partially blind.\r\n\r\nThe amaurosis has been known to come on suddenly, and after a very brief\r\nexposure to lead, _e.g._, a man, thirty-four years of age, after working\r\nfor three days in a white-lead factory, was seized with intense ciliary\r\nneuralgia, had pains in his limbs and symptoms of lead-poisoning, and\r\nthe right eye became amaurotic.[846] This form of impairment or loss of\r\nvision is different from the _Retinitis albuminurica_,[847] which may\r\nalso be produced as a secondary effect of the poison; the kidneys in\r\nsuch cases being profoundly affected. The kind of diseased kidney\r\nproduced by lead is the granular contracted kidney.\r\n\r\n[846] Samelsohn, _Monatsbl. f. Augenheilk._, vol. xi. p. 246, 1873. See\r\nalso a case of lead amaurosis, described by Mr. W. Holder, _Pharm.\r\nJourn._, Oct. 14, 1876.\r\n\r\n[847] Ran, _Arch. f. Ophthal._, vol. i. (2), p. 205, 1858, and Schmidt’s\r\n_Jahrbuch_, Bd. cxxxiii. p. 116; Bd. cxliii. p. 67.\r\n\r\nEulenberg speaks of the sexual functions being weakened, leading to more\r\nor less impotence.\r\n\r\nLewy,[848] in 1186 patients suffering from lead-poisoning, has found\r\ncaries or necrosis in twenty-two cases, or about 1·8 per cent.; fifteen\r\nwere carious affections of the upper jaw, four of the fore-arm, two of\r\nthe thigh, and one of the rib and sternum. Epilepsy and epileptiform\r\nconvulsions occur in a few cases; it is very possible that the epilepsy\r\nmay be a result of the uræmic poisoning induced by diseased kidneys.\r\n\r\n[848] _Die Berufskrank. d. Bleiarbeiter_, Wien, 1873, S. 61.\r\n\r\nFive cases of fatal poisoning occurred between 1884-6 among the employés\r\nof a certain white-lead factory in the east of London. The cases\r\npresented the following common characters. They were all adult women,\r\naged from 18 to 33, and they had worked at the factory for short\r\nperiods, from three to twelve months. They all exhibited mild symptoms\r\nof plumbism, such as a blue line round the gums, and more or less\r\nill-defined indisposition; paralyses were absent. They were all in their\r\nusual state of health within a few hours or days preceding death. Death\r\nwas unexpected, mostly sudden. In four cases it was preceded by\r\nepileptic fits and coma; but in the fifth case no convulsions were\r\nnoted, although they may have occurred in the night.\r\n\r\nThe author[849] had an opportunity of investigating by chemical means\r\nthe distribution of lead in the fourth and fifth cases in the liver,\r\nkidney, and brain.\r\n\r\n[849] “The Distribution of Lead in the Brains of two Lead Factory\r\nOperatives,” _Journ. of Mental Science_, Jan. 1888.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth case, from 402 grms. of liver 24·26 mgrms. of lead\r\nsulphate were separated. The right kidney (weighing 81 grms.) yielded\r\n5·42 mgrms. of lead sulphate. The brain was dehydrated with alcohol, and\r\nthen treated with ether, hot alcohol, and chloroform until an albuminoid\r\nresidue remained; lead was extracted from each of these portions, viz.,\r\nthe alcohol used for dehydration, the ethereal and chloroform extracts,\r\nand the albuminoid residue, as follows:--\r\n\r\n                                                  Mgrms. of Lead\r\n                                                    Sulphate.\r\n  Soluble in cold alcohol,                            1·11\r\n  Soluble in ether and chloroform and hot alcohol,   25·47\r\n  Albuminoid residue,                                 7·76\r\n                                                     34·34\r\n\r\nIn the fifth case, the brain was examined more in detail, and the lead\r\npresent estimated in the following solutions and substances:--\r\n\r\n1. Alcohol used for dehydration. This may be called “the watery\r\nextract,” for, after the brain has remained in strong alcohol for some\r\nweeks, the result is that the alcohol contains much water and substances\r\nextracted with water.\r\n\r\n2. White matter--(_a_) from cerebrum; (_b_) from cerebellum.\r\n\r\n3. Kephalin--(_a_) from cerebrum; (_b_) from cerebellum.\r\n\r\n4. Ether extract, kephalin-free--(_a_) from cerebrum; (_b_) from\r\ncerebellum.\r\n\r\n5. Substances soluble in cold alcohol--(_a_) from cerebrum; (_b_) from\r\ncerebellum.\r\n\r\n6. The albuminoid residue--(_a_) from cerebrum; (_b_) from cerebellum.\r\n\r\nThe general results were as follows:--\r\n\r\n                                      Cerebrum,        Cerebellum,\r\n                                     460·8 grms.       156·2 grms.\r\n                                  Mgrms. of PbSO₄.   Mgrms. of PbSO₄.\r\n\r\n  White matter freed from kephalin\r\n  by ether,                             0·0               5·0\r\n  Kephalin,                             1·5               6·0\r\n  Ether extract, kephalin-free,         0·0               0·0\r\n  Substances soluble in cold alcohol,   0·0               0·0\r\n  Albuminoid residue,                  40·0               6·0\r\n                                       ----              ----\r\n                                       41·5              17·0\r\n\r\nThe aqueous extract contained 1·5 mgrm. of lead sulphate. In neither of\r\nthe cases did the pathologist ascertain the total weight of the brain,\r\nbut, presuming that the weight was an average weight, and that the lead\r\nin the remainder of the brain was similarly distributed, the amount of\r\nlead calculated as sulphate would amount to 117 mgrms. From these\r\nresults it appears to the author probable that lead forms a substitution\r\ncompound with some of the organic brain matters. This view would explain\r\nthe absence of changes apparent to the eye found in so many of the fatal\r\ncases of lead encephalopathy.\r\n\r\n§ 785. Lead taken for a long time causes the blood to be impregnated\r\nwith uric acid. In 136 cases of undoubted gout, 18 per cent. of the\r\npatients were found to follow lead occupations, and presented signs of\r\nlead impregnation.[850]\r\n\r\n[850] “On Lead Impregnation in Relation to Gout,” by Dyce Duckworth,\r\nM.D., _St. Barth. Hosp. Reports_, vol. xvii., 1881.\r\n\r\nEllenberger and Hofmeister[851] found that, with chronic poisoning of\r\nsheep with lead, excretion of hippuric acid ceased, and the output of\r\nuric acid was diminished. This may be explained by the formation of\r\nglycocol being arrested.\r\n\r\n[851] _Arch. f. wiss. u. pract. Thierheilk._, Bd. x., 1884.\r\n\r\n§ 786. There are some facts on record which would seem to countenance\r\nthe belief that disease, primarily caused by an inorganic body like\r\nlead, may be transmitted. M. Paul (_e.g._) has related the history of\r\nthe offspring (thirty-two in number) of seven men, who were suffering\r\nfrom lead-poisoning--eleven were prematurely born and one still-born; of\r\nthe remaining twenty, eight died in the first year, four in the second,\r\nand five in the third year, so that of the whole thirty-two, only three\r\nsurvived three years.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the poison on pregnant women is, indeed, very\r\ndeleterious. M. Paul noted that in four women who were habitually\r\nexposed to the influence of lead, and had fifteen pregnancies, ten\r\nterminated by abortion, two by premature confinement, three went the\r\nfull term, but one of the three children was born dead, a second only\r\nlived twenty-four hours; so that, out of the whole fifteen, one only\r\nlived fully. In another observation of M. Paul’s, five women had two\r\nnatural confinements before being exposed to lead. After exposure, the\r\nhistory of the thirty-six pregnancies of these women is as\r\nfollows:--there were twenty-six abortions (from two to five months), one\r\npremature confinement, two infants born dead, and five born alive, four\r\nof whom died in the first year.\r\n\r\nChronic poisoning may be nearly always accounted for by the inhaling of\r\nlead dust, or by the actual swallowing of some form of lead; but, if we\r\nare to accept the fact narrated by the late Dr. Taylor, viz., that he\r\nhimself had an attack of lead colic from sitting in a room for a few\r\nhours daily, in which there was a large canvas covered with white lead\r\nand drying oil, and one or two other similar cases,[852] we must allow\r\nthat there is some subtle volatile organic compound of lead evolved. In\r\nthe present state of our knowledge, it seems more reasonable to account\r\nfor such cases by the suggestion that lead has entered the system by an\r\nunsuspected channel.\r\n\r\n[852] The gate-keeper of a graveyard at Bordeaux continually used the\r\nremnants of crosses, covered with lead paint, to replenish his fire; the\r\nchimney smoked; gradually paralysis of the extensors of the right wrist\r\ndeveloped itself, and he suffered from colic and other signs of\r\nlead-poisoning.--Marmisse, _Gaz. des Hôpit._, No. 25, 1866.\r\n\r\nIn 1882, a very interesting case occurred at Keighley, in which a\r\nmechanic, aged 42, died from the supposed effects of lead-poisoning,\r\ninduced from drinking the town water, which was proved by Mr. Allen to\r\ncontain about ⅗ of a grain of lead per gallon. For six months he had\r\nbeen out of health, and a week before his death he suffered from colic,\r\nvomiting, constipation, and a blue line round the gums, and occasional\r\nepileptiform seizures. After death the kidneys were found granular, and\r\nthe heart somewhat enlarged. The viscera were submitted to Mr. Allen for\r\nanalysis; no lead was found in the heart or brain, a slight,\r\nnon-estimable trace in the kidneys, and about a grain was separated from\r\nthe liver and spleen. Dr. Tidy, who was called in as an expert, gave a\r\nvery guarded opinion, rather against the theory of direct\r\nlead-poisoning; and the verdict returned by the jury was to the effect\r\nthat the deceased died from granular kidney, accelerated by\r\nlead-poisoning. Murder by the administration of doses of sugar of lead\r\nis rare, but such a case has occurred.\r\n\r\nAt the Central Criminal Court, in December 1882, Louisa Jane Taylor was\r\nindicted for poisoning Mary Ann Tregillis at Plumstead, and convicted.\r\nFrom the evidence it appeared that the prisoner, who was thirty-six\r\nyears of age, came to reside with Mr. and Mrs. Tregillis, an aged couple\r\nof eighty-five and eighty-one years respectively. The prisoner was\r\nproved to have purchased at different times an ounce and half an ounce\r\nof sugar of lead, and to have added a white powder to the medicine of\r\nMrs. Tregillis. The illness of the latter extended from about August 23\r\nto October 23--a period of two months. It is difficult to say when the\r\nfirst dose could have been given, but it was probably some time between\r\nAugust 13 and 23, while the administration, without doubt, ceased on or\r\nbefore October 6, for on that date different nursing arrangements were\r\nmade. The symptoms observed were nausea, vomiting, pain in the pit of\r\nthe stomach, burning in the throat, very dark teeth, a blue line round\r\nthe gums, and slight jaundice. There was great muscular weakness, with\r\ntrembling of the hands, and a week before death there was paralysis of\r\nthe right side.\r\n\r\nLead was discovered in most of the viscera, which were in great part\r\nnormal, but the kidneys were wasted, and the mucous membrane blackened.\r\nThe actual quantity of lead recovered by analysis was small, viz., 16·2\r\nmgrms. (¼ grain) from the liver; from 8 ounces of brain, 3·2 mgrms.\r\n(1/20 grain); from half of the stomach, 16·2 mgrms. (¼ grain); and from\r\nthe spleen, the kidneys, and the lungs, small quantities. It is,\r\ntherefore, probable that, if the whole body had been operated upon, the\r\nyield would have been more than ·15 grm. (a little over 2 grains); but\r\nthen, it must be remembered that the deceased lived, at least, seventeen\r\ndays after the last dose.\r\n\r\n§ 787. =Post-mortem Appearances.=--In acute cases of poisoning by the\r\nacetate, there may sometimes be found a slight inflammatory appearance\r\nof the mucous membrane of the stomach and intestines. Orfila considered\r\nthat streaks of white points adherent to the mucous membrane were\r\npathognomonic; but there have been several cases in which only negative\r\nor doubtful signs of inflammatory or other action have presented\r\nthemselves. A general contraction of the intestines has often been\r\nnoticed, and is of considerable significance when present; so also is a\r\ngrey-black mucous membrane caused by deposited lead sulphide. Loen found\r\nin dogs and guinea-pigs, poisoned by lead, local inflammation areas in\r\nthe lungs, liver, and kidneys; but in no case fatty degeneration of the\r\nepithelial cells of the liver, kidneys, or intestines. As a rule, no\r\nunabsorbed poison will be found in the stomach; the case related by\r\nChristison, in which a person died on the third day after taking at a\r\nsingle dose some large quantity of acetate of lead; and at the autopsy a\r\nfluid was obtained from the stomach, which had a sweet metallic taste,\r\non evaporation smelt of acetic acid, and from which metallic lead was\r\nobtained--is so very extraordinary in every respect, that its entire\r\naccuracy is to be questioned. In death from chronic lead-poisoning,\r\nthere is but little that can be called diagnostic; a granular condition\r\nof the kidneys, and all the pathological changes dependent on such a\r\ncondition, are most frequently seen. If the patient has suffered from\r\ncolic, a constriction of portions of the intestine has been noticed;\r\nalso, in cases in which there has been long-standing paralysis of groups\r\nof muscles, these muscles are wasted, and possibly degenerated. In\r\ninstances, again, in which lead has induced gout, the pathological\r\nchanges dependent upon gout will be prominent. The blue line around the\r\ngums, and sometimes a coloration by sulphide of lead of portions of the\r\nintestines, may help a proper interpretation of the appearances seen\r\nafter death; but all who have given any attention to the subject will\r\nagree that, simply from pathological evidence, it is impossible to\r\ndiagnose chronic lead-poisoning.\r\n\r\n§ 788. =Physiological Action of Lead.=--The action of lead is still\r\nobscure, but it is considered to have an effect mainly on the nervous\r\ncentres. The paralysed muscles respond to the direct current, but not to\r\nthe induced, leading to the suspicion that the intramuscular\r\nterminations of the nerves are paralysed, but that the muscular\r\nsubstance itself is unattacked. On the other hand, the restriction of\r\nthe action to groups of muscles supports the theory of central action.\r\n\r\nThe lead colic is due to a true spasmodic constriction of the bowel, the\r\nexciting cause of which lies in the walls of the bowel itself; the\r\nrelief given by pressure is explained by the pressure causing an anæmia\r\nof the intestinal walls, and thus lessening their sensibility. The\r\nslowing of the pulse produced by small doses is explained as due to a\r\nstimulation of the inhibitory nerves; and, lastly, many nervous\r\nphenomena, such as epilepsy, &c., are in part due to imperfect\r\nelimination of the urinary excreta, causing similar conditions to those\r\nobserved in uræmia.\r\n\r\n§ 789. =Elimination of Lead.=--When a large dose of acetate or carbonate\r\nis taken, part is transformed into more or less insoluble\r\ncompounds--some organic, others inorganic; so that a great portion is\r\nnot absorbed into the body at all, but passes into the intestines,\r\nwhere, meeting with hydric sulphide, part is changed into sulphide,\r\ncolouring the alvine evacuations black. Some of the lead which is\r\nabsorbed is excreted by the kidneys, but the search often yields only\r\ntraces. Thudichum[853] states that in fourteen cases of lead-poisoning,\r\nin two only was obtained a weighable quantity from a day’s urine; in the\r\nremaining twelve lead was detected, but only by the brownish colour\r\nproduced in an acid solution of the ash by hydric sulphide.\r\n\r\n[853] _Pathology of the Urine_, p. 550.\r\n\r\nThe elimination of lead by the kidneys is favoured by certain medicines,\r\nsuch, for example, as potassic iodide. Annuschat found in dogs poisoned\r\nby lead from 3·8 to 4·1 mgrms. in 100 c.c. of urine; but, after doses of\r\npotassic iodide, the content of lead rose to 6·9 and even to 14 mgrms.\r\nLead appears to be eliminated by the skin, being taken up by the\r\nepithelial cells, and minute, insoluble particles coming away with these\r\ncells. If a person who has taken small doses of lead for a time be\r\nplaced in a sulphur water-bath, or have his skin moistened with a 5 per\r\ncent. solution of sodium sulphide, the upper layer of the epidermis is\r\ncoloured dark; but the perspiration excited by pilocarpin or other\r\nagency contains no lead.\r\n\r\n§ 790. =Fatal Dose=--(_a._) =Sugar of Lead.=--It may almost be said that\r\nit is impossible to destroy human life with any single dose likely to be\r\ntaken or administered. In three cases an ounce (28·3 grms.) has been\r\ntaken without fatal result. Although it must be allowed that repeated\r\nmoderate doses, extending over some time, are more dangerous to health\r\nand life than a single large dose, yet there seems to be in some\r\nindividuals a great tolerance of lead. Christison has given ·18 grm. in\r\ndivided doses daily for a long time without any bad effect, save the\r\nproduction of a slight colic. Swieten has also given daily 3·9 grms. (60\r\ngrains) in ten days without observing toxic effects. That, in other\r\ncases, less than a grain per gallon of some lead compound dissolved in\r\ndrinking-water, or in some way introduced into the economy, causes\r\nserious illness, is most inexplicable.\r\n\r\n(_b._) =The Basic Acetate= in solution is more poisonous apparently than\r\nthe acetate--60 c.c. (1½ drms.) have caused serious symptoms.\r\n\r\n(_c._) =The Carbonate of Lead.=--Doses of anything like 28 grms. (an\r\nounce) would probably be very dangerous to an adult; the only case of\r\ndeath on record is that of a child who took some unknown quantity,\r\nprobably, from the description of the size of the lump, about 10 grms.\r\n(2½ drms.).\r\n\r\n§ 791. =Antidotes and Treatment.=--Soluble sulphates (especially\r\nmagnesic sulphate) have been given largely in both acute and chronic\r\ncases; in the acute, it stands to reason that it is well to ensure the\r\npresence of plenty of sulphates in the stomach and intestines, in order\r\nto form the sparingly soluble lead sulphate, should any residue remain;\r\nbut to expect this double decomposition to go on in the blood and\r\ntissues is not based upon sound observation. The chronic lead-poisoning\r\nis best treated by removal from the source of mischief, the\r\nadministration of large quantities of distilled water, and medicinal\r\ndoses of potassic iodide.\r\n\r\n§ 792. =Localisation of Lead.=--In a dog, which was killed by chronic\r\nlead-poisoning, Heubel found in the bones 0·18 to 0·27 per 1000 of lead;\r\nin the kidneys, 0·17 to 0·20; liver, 0·10 to 0·33; spinal cord, 0·06 to\r\n0·11; brain, 0·04 to 0·05; muscles, 0·02 to 0·04; in the intestines\r\ntraces, 0·01 to 0·02; in the spleen, the blood, and the bile, he also\r\nonly found traces. Ellenberger and Hofmeister found in the kidneys of\r\nthe sheep, 0·44 to 0·47; liver, 0·36 to 0·65; pancreas, 0·54; salivary\r\nglands, 0·42; bile, 0·11 to 0·40; bones, 0·32; fæces, 0·22; spleen,\r\n0·14; central nervous system, 0·07 to 0·18; blood, 0·05 to 0·12; flesh,\r\n0·05 to 0·08; urine, 0·06 to 0·08; and in the unstriped muscles and the\r\nlungs, 0·03 per 1000 of lead.\r\n\r\nWithout going so far as to say that lead is a natural constituent of the\r\nbody, it is certain that it may be frequently met with in persons who\r\nhave been apparently perfectly healthy, and quite free from all symptoms\r\nof lead-poisoning. Legrip found in the liver and spleen of a healthy\r\nperson, 5·4 mgrms. of lead oxide in every kilogram; Oidtmann, in the\r\nliver of a man fifty-six years of age, 1 mgrm. of lead oxide per\r\nkilogram, and in the spleen 3 mgrms. per kilogram. Hence, the analyst,\r\nin searching for poison, must be very careful in his conclusions. Grave\r\nand serious errors may also arise from complications; suppose, _e.g._,\r\nthat a deceased person previous to death had partaken of game, and\r\ninadvertently swallowed a shot--if the analyst had not carefully\r\nsearched the contents of the stomach for _solid_ bodies, but merely\r\ntreated them at once with acid solvents, he would naturally get very\r\ndecided lead reactions, and would possibly conclude, and give evidence\r\nto the effect, that a poisonous soluble salt of lead had been\r\nadministered shortly before death.\r\n\r\n§ 793. =Detection and Estimation of Lead.=--A great number of fluids\r\n(such as beer, wines, vinegar, water, &c.), if they contain anything\r\nlike the amount of one-tenth of a milligramme in 100 c.c., will give a\r\nvery marked dark colour with SH₂. It is, however, usually safest in the\r\nfirst place to concentrate the liquid, to add an acid, and deposit the\r\nlead on platinum, in the way to be shortly described. Nearly all the\r\nlead from oils and fatty matter may be dissolved out by shaking up the\r\nfat with dilute nitric acid; if necessary, the fat should previously be\r\nmelted.\r\n\r\nIf (in the usual course of routine research) a hydrochloric acid\r\nsolution is obtained from the treatment or destruction of organic\r\nsubstances by that agent, and lead sulphide (mixed possibly with other\r\nsulphides) is filtered off, any arsenical sulphide may first be\r\nextracted from the filter by ammonia, and any antimonious sulphide by\r\nsodic sulphide; then the sulphide may be extracted by warm hydrochloric\r\nacid, which will leave undissolved such sulphides as those of copper and\r\nmercury. On diluting the liquid, and filtration at a boiling\r\ntemperature, crystals of lead chloride will be deposited on cooling.\r\n\r\nIf, however, organic matters are _specially_ searched for lead,\r\nhydrochloric acid is not the best solvent, but nitric should always be\r\npreferred; and, if there is reason to think that the lead exists in the\r\nform of sulphate, then the proper solvent is either the acetate or the\r\ntartrate of ammonia; but, in either case, the solution should contain an\r\nexcess of ammonia. It must, however, be remembered that organic matters\r\nretain lead with great tenacity, and that in all cases where it can with\r\nany convenience be effected, the substances should be not only\r\ncarbonised, but burnt to an ash; for Boucher has shown[854] that carbon\r\nretains lead, and that the lead in carbon resists to a considerable\r\nextent the action of solvents.\r\n\r\n[854] _Ann. d’Hygiène_, t. xli.\r\n\r\nIn the case of sulphate of lead, which may be always produced in an ash\r\nfrom organic substances by previous treatment with sufficient sulphuric\r\nacid, a very excellent method of identification is to convert it into\r\nsugar of lead. To do this, it is merely necessary to boil it with\r\ncarbonate of ammonia, which changes it into carbonate of lead; treatment\r\nwith acetic acid will now give the acetate; the solution may (if the\r\nlead is in very small quantity) be concentrated in a watch-glass, a\r\ndrop evaporated to dryness on a circle of thin microscopic glass, and\r\nthe crystals examined by the microscope; the same film next exposed to\r\nthe fumes of SH₂, which will blacken it; and lastly, the solution (which\r\nshould be sweet) tasted. A crystalline substance, possessing a sweet\r\ntaste, and blackening when exposed to SH₂, can, under the circumstances,\r\nbe no other substance than acetate of lead.\r\n\r\nIf the analyst does not care for this method, there is room for choice.\r\nLead in solution can be converted into sulphide; in this case it is,\r\nhowever, absolutely necessary that there should be no great excess of\r\nacid, since as little as 2·5 per cent. of free hydrochloric acid will\r\nprevent all the lead going down. On obtaining the sulphide, the latter,\r\nas already described, can be converted into chloride by hydrochloric\r\nacid, and the crystalline chloride is extremely characteristic.\r\n\r\nFrom the solution of the chloride the metal may be obtained in a solid\r\nstate by inserting a piece of zinc in the solution contained in a\r\ncrucible; the lead will be deposited gradually, and can be then\r\ncollected, washed, and finally fused into a little globule on charcoal.\r\nA lead bead flattens easily when hit with a hammer, and makes a mark on\r\npaper. Solutions of the chloride also give a heavy precipitate of lead\r\nsulphate, when treated with a solution of sodic sulphate.\r\n\r\nWhen lead is in very minute quantity, an electrolytic method is\r\ngenerally preferable; the lead is precipitated on platinum by using\r\nexactly the same apparatus as in Bloxam’s test, described at p. 566; the\r\nliquid to be tested being placed in the inner cell, the lead film may\r\nnow be identified, dissolved in nitric acid, and estimated by a\r\ncolorimetric process. For the estimation of the minute fractions of a\r\ngrain by a colour method, it is merely necessary to have a very dilute\r\nsolution of acetate of lead, to add a known volume of SH₂ water to the\r\nliquid to be tested in a Nessler cylinder, noting the colour, and add to\r\nanother a known quantity of the standard lead solution and the same\r\nquantity of SH₂ as was added to the first.\r\n\r\nThe process has an advantage which is great, viz., that it either\r\ndetects copper, or proves its absence at the same time; and there are\r\nfew cases in which the analyst does not look for copper as well as for\r\nlead. Lead, if in sufficient quantity, may be most conveniently\r\nestimated as oxide, sulphate, or chloride; the chief properties of these\r\nsubstances have been already described.\r\n\r\n§ 794. =The Detection of Lead in Tartaric Acid, in Lemonade, and Aërated\r\nWaters.=--To detect lead in tartaric acid a convenient method is to burn\r\nit to an ash, digest in a little strong sulphuric acid, and then add\r\neither sodic chloride or a drop of HCl; lead, if present, is\r\nprecipitated as chloride, giving a pearly opalescence. Lemonades often\r\ncontain minute quantities of iron and copper as well as lead. Neither\r\ncopper nor iron are precipitated by ammonium sulphide in presence of\r\npotassic cyanide. On the other hand, the sulphide of lead is not soluble\r\nin the alkaline cyanides. Hence a liquid which, on the addition of\r\npotassium cyanide and then ammonium sulphide, becomes dark coloured, or\r\nfrom which a precipitate separates, contains lead.[855]\r\n\r\n[855] F. L. Teed, _Analyst_, xvii. 142-143.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. COPPER.\r\n\r\n§ 795. =Copper=, Cu = 63·5; specific gravity, from 8·921 to 8·952;\r\nfusing-point, 1091° (1996° F.). Copper in analysis occurs either as a\r\nfilm or coating on such metals as platinum, iron, &c., or in a state of\r\nfine division; or, finally, as a bead. In thin films, copper has a\r\nyellowish or a yellowish-red colour; it dissolves readily in nitric,\r\nslowly in hydrochloric acid. If air be excluded, hydrochloric acid fails\r\nto dissolve copper, and the same remark applies to ammonia; but, if\r\nthere be free access of air, ammonia also acts as a slow solvent.\r\nMetallic copper in a fine state of division can be fused at a white heat\r\nto a bright bluish-green globule, which, on cooling, is covered with\r\nblack oxide.\r\n\r\n§ 796. =Cupric Oxide= (CuO = 79·5; specific gravity, 6·5, composition in\r\n100 parts, Cu 79·85, O 20·15) is a brownish-black powder, which remains\r\nin the absence of reducing gases unaltered at a red heat. It is nearly\r\ninsoluble in water, but soluble in ClH, NO₃H, &c.; it is hygroscopic,\r\nand, as every one who has made a combustion knows, is readily reduced by\r\nignition with charcoal in the presence of reducing gases.\r\n\r\n§ 797. =Cupric Sulphide=, CuS = 95·5, produced in the wet way, is a\r\nbrownish powder so insoluble in water that, according to Fresenius,\r\n950,000 parts of water are required to dissolve one part. It is not\r\nquite insoluble in ClH, and dissolves readily in nitric acid with\r\nseparation of sulphur. By ignition in a stream of H it may be converted\r\ninto the subsulphide of copper. It must always be washed by SH₂ water.\r\n\r\n§ 798. =Solubility of Copper in Water and Various Fluids.=--The\r\nsolubility of copper in water and saline solutions has been very\r\ncarefully studied by Carnelley.[856] Distilled water exerts some solvent\r\naction, the amount varying, as might be expected, according to the time\r\nof exposure, the amount of surface exposed, the quantity of water acting\r\nupon the copper, &c. It would appear that, under favourable\r\ncircumstances, 100 c.c. of distilled water may dissolve ·3 mgrm. of\r\ncopper (·2 grain per gallon).\r\n\r\n[856] _Journ. Chem. Soc._, 1876, vol. ii. p. 4.\r\n\r\nWith regard to salts, those of ammonium exert a solvent action on\r\ncopper more decided than that of any others known. With the others,\r\nhowever, the nature of the base exerts little influence, the action of\r\nthe salt depending chiefly on the nature of its acid radical. Thus,\r\nbeginning with the least effective, the following is the order of\r\ndissolving strength:--Nitrates, sulphates, carbonates, and chlorides. It\r\nwill then at once be evident that a water, contaminated by sewage, and\r\ntherefore containing plenty of ammonia and chlorides, might exert a very\r\nconsiderable solvent action on copper.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the oils and fats, as well as syrups, dissolve small\r\nquantities of copper; hence its frequent presence in articles of food\r\ncooked or prepared in copper vessels. In the very elaborate and careful\r\nexperiments of Mr. W. Thompson,[857] the only oils which took up no\r\ncopper, when digested on copper foil, were English neats’-foot oil,\r\ntallow oil, one sample of olive oil, palm-nut oil, common tallow oil,\r\nand white oil, which was protected from the air by a thick coating of\r\noxidised oil on its surface.\r\n\r\n[857] “Action of Fatty Oils on Metallic Copper,” _Chem. News_, vol.\r\nxxxiv. pp. 176, 200, 313.\r\n\r\nThe formation of copper compounds with the fatty acids takes place so\r\nreadily that Jeannel[858] has proposed the green colouring of fats by\r\ncopper as a test for the presence of copper; and Bottger[859] recommends\r\na copper holding brandy to be shaken up with olive oil to free it from\r\ncopper.\r\n\r\n[858] _L’Union pharmac._, xvii. 81.\r\n\r\n[859] _Arch. de Pharm._, 1853, cxxvi. 67.\r\n\r\nLehmann has made some useful researches on the amount of copper taken up\r\nby fats under different conditions. 100 c.c. of strongly rancid fat\r\ndissolved in fourteen days 8·7 mgrms. of copper; but when heated to 160°\r\nfor one hour, and then allowed to stand, a similar amount was found.\r\nSome rancid butter was rubbed into a brass bowl of 90 c.c. capacity, and\r\nthen allowed to stand for twenty-four hours; the butter became of a\r\nblue-green colour. Into this dish, thus partially attacked by fatty\r\nacids, 50 c.c. of rancid butter was poured in a melted condition, and\r\nallowed to stand for twenty-four hours. The amount taken up was found to\r\nbe equal to 10 mgrms. of copper for every 100 c.c. of fluid butter.\r\n\r\nHilger found a fatty soup, which had stood twelve hours in a clean\r\ncopper vessel, to contain 0·163 per cent. copper. According to Tschirch,\r\nthe easiest fatty salt to form is the oleate, hydrated copper oxide\r\ndissolving in oleic acid with great ease, and even copper oxide\r\ndissolving to some extent; the palmitate and the stearate are not so\r\nreadily produced; hence the amount of copper dissolved is greater in the\r\ncase of olive oil and butter (both rich in oleic acids) than in the case\r\nof the firmer animal fats. Acid solutions, such as clarets, acetic acid,\r\nvinegars, and so forth, as might be expected, dissolve more or less\r\ncopper. The amount likely to be dissolved in practice has been\r\ninvestigated by Lehmann. He steeped 600 square metres of copper\r\nsheeting or brass sheeting in vessels holding 2 litres of acid claret;\r\nthe sheets were in some of the experiments wholly immersed, in others\r\npartly so. More copper was dissolved by the wine when the copper was\r\npartly immersed than when it was wholly immersed; and more copper was\r\ndissolved from brass sheeting than from pure copper sheeting. With a\r\nsheet of copper, partly immersed, claret may contain as much as 56\r\nmgrms. per litre. Lehmann also investigated the amount of copper, as\r\nacetate, which could be dissolved in wine before the taste betrayed its\r\npresence: with 50 mgrms. per litre no copper taste; with 100 mgrms.\r\nthere was a weak after taste; with 150 mgrms. it was scarcely drinkable,\r\nand there was a strong after taste; with 200 mgrms. per litre it was\r\nquite undrinkable, and the colour was changed to bluish-green. Vinegar,\r\nacting under the most favourable circumstances on sheet brass or copper,\r\ndissolved, in seven days, 195 mgrms. of copper per litre from the copper\r\nsheet, 195 from the brass sheet.\r\n\r\nLehmann discusses the amount of copper which may be taken at a meal\r\nunder the circumstance that everything eaten or drank has been\r\nartificially coppered, but none “coppered” to the extent by which the\r\npresence of the metal could be betrayed by the taste; and the following\r\nis, he thinks, possible:--\r\n\r\n  300 c.c. of soup boiled in a copper vessel,          20 mgrms. Cu.\r\n  1 litre of wine which has been standing in a\r\n  copper vessel,                                       50      „\r\n  50 c.c. vinegar which has been kept in a copper\r\n  vessel,                                              10      „\r\n  50 grms. of fat which has been used for frying in a\r\n  copper vessel,                                        5      „\r\n  200 grms. of strongly coppered peas,                 50      „\r\n  500 grms. of strongly coppered bread,                60      „\r\n\r\nThe total only amounts to 195 mgrms. of copper, which only slightly\r\nexceeds a high medicinal dose. The metal is tasted more easily in\r\nliquids, such as wine, than in bread; bread may be coppered so that at a\r\nmeal a person might eat 200 mgrms. of a copper compound without tasting\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIt is pretty well accepted that cooking in clean bright copper vessels\r\nwill not contaminate any ordinary food sufficiently to be injurious to\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\n§ 799. =Copper in the Vegetable and Animal Kingdom and in\r\nFoods.=--Copper is widely distributed in the vegetable kingdom, and is a\r\nconstant constituent of the chief foods we consume; the following\r\nquantities, for example, have been separated from the chief cereals:--\r\n\r\n  Wheat,        5·2 to 10·8 mgrms. per kilo.\r\n  Rye,          5   mgrms.              „\r\n  Oats,         8·5  „                  „\r\n  Barley,      11·8  „                  „\r\n  Rice,         1·6  „                  „\r\n  Bread,        1·5 to 4·4 mgrms.       „\r\n\r\nIt has also been found in vermicelli (2-10 mgrms. per kilo.), groats\r\n(1·6-3 mgrms. per kilo.), potatoes (1·8 mgrm. per kilo.), beans (2-11\r\nmgrms. per kilo.). In similar small quantities it has also been found in\r\ncarrots, chicory, spinach, hazel-nuts, blackberries, peaches, pears,\r\nfigs, plums, tamarinds, black pepper, and many other fruits and spices.\r\nThe most common food which has a high copper content is cocoa, which\r\ncontains from 12 mgrms. to 29 mgrms. per kilo., the highest amount of\r\ncopper being in the outer husk; copper has also been found in many\r\nsupplies of drinking water, in aërated waters, in brandies, wines, and\r\nmany drugs.\r\n\r\nIt has been calculated that the ordinary daily food of an average man\r\ncontains the following:--\r\n\r\n  Copper.\r\n  900 grms. bread,                   0·45 mgrm.\r\n  260 grms. meat,                    0·25  „\r\n  200 grms. fruit and vegetables,    0·25  „\r\n                                     ----\r\n                                     0·95 mgrm.\r\n\r\nThat is to say, that, neglecting altogether foods artificially\r\ncontaminated with copper, each of us eats daily about 1 mgrm. of copper\r\n(0·015 grain).\r\n\r\nIn the animal kingdom it is a constant and natural constituent of the\r\nblood of the cephalopods, crustacea, and gasteropods, and is nearly\r\nalways present in the liver and kidneys of domestic animals, as well as\r\nin men. Dr. Dupré[860] found ·035 to ·029 grain (1·8 to 2 mgrms.) in\r\nhuman livers, or about 1 part in 500,000. Bergeron and L. L’Hôte’s\r\nresearches on fourteen bodies, specially examined for copper, fully\r\nsubstantiate those of Dr. Dupré; in twelve the copper was found in\r\nquantities of from ·7 to 1·5 mgrm.; in the remaining two the amount of\r\ncopper was very minute, and was not estimated.[861] Copper is also found\r\nnormally in the kidneys, and Dupré [862] detected in human kidneys about\r\n1 in 100,000 parts; it is also found in the bile, and in minute traces\r\nin the blood.[863]\r\n\r\n[860] _Analyst_, No. 13, 1877.\r\n\r\n[861] _Compt. Rendus_, vol. lxxx. p. 268.\r\n\r\n[862] _Op. cit._\r\n\r\n[863] Hoppe-Seyler, _Handbuch der physiologisch. Analyse_, p. 415.\r\n\r\nIn the kidneys and livers of the ruminants copper may always be found, a\r\nsheep’s liver containing about 1 part in 20,000.[864] Church found\r\ncopper in the feathers of the wings of the turaco; melopsitt in the\r\nfeathers of a parroquet (_Melopsittacus undulatus_).[865] In these cases\r\nthe copper enters into the composition of the colouring matter to which\r\nthe name of “turacin” has been given. Turacin contains 7 per cent. of\r\ncopper, and gives to analysis numbers which agree with the formula of\r\nC₈₂H₈₁Cu₂N₉O₃₂.\r\n\r\n[864] Dupré, _op. cit._\r\n\r\n[865] _Chem. News_, xxviij. 212.\r\n\r\nCopper has been discovered in aërated waters, its presence being due to\r\nthe use of copper cylinders, the tin lining of which had been rendered\r\ndefective by corrosion.[866]\r\n\r\n[866] “On the Presence of Lead and Copper in Aërated Waters,” by Dr.\r\nJames Milne, _Chem. News_, xxxi. p. 77.\r\n\r\nAccidents may also occur from the use of copper boilers. Mr. W. Thompson\r\nfound in one case[867] no less than 3·575 grains in a gallon (51 mgrms.\r\nper litre) in water drawn from a kitchen boiler.\r\n\r\n[867] _Chem. News_, xxxi. No. 801.\r\n\r\nAt Roubaix, in France, sulphide of copper had been deposited on the\r\nroof, as a consequence of the use of copper flues; the sulphide was\r\nchanged into sulphate by the action of the air, and washed by the rain\r\ninto the water-tank.[868]\r\n\r\n[868] Author’s _Dictionary of Hygiène_, p. 167.\r\n\r\nThat preserved vegetables are made of a bright and attractive green\r\ncolour by impregnation with copper, from the deliberate use of copper\r\nvessels for this purpose, is a fact long known. Green peas especially\r\nhave been coloured in this way, and a number of convictions for this\r\noffence have taken place in England.\r\n\r\n§ 800. =The “Coppering” of Vegetables.=--The fact that green vegetables,\r\nsuch as peas, beans, cucumbers, and so forth, preserve their green\r\ncolour, if boiled in copper vessels, has long been known. In this\r\n“coppering” the French have been more active than the English traders;\r\nthe French operate in two different ways. One method is, to dip from 60\r\nto 70 litres of the green vegetables in 100 litres of 0·3 to 0·7 per\r\ncent. of copper sulphate, to leave them there for from five to fifteen\r\nminutes, then to remove them, wash and sterilise in an autoclave. A\r\nsecond method is to put the vegetables into a copper vessel, the wall of\r\nwhich is connected with the negative pole of an electric current, the\r\npositive pole dips in a solution of salt in the same vessel, the current\r\nis allowed to pass for three minutes, and the vegetables are afterwards\r\nsterilised. Fruits are simply allowed to stand with water in copper\r\nvessels, the natural acidity of the juice dissolving sufficient copper.\r\n\r\nThe amount of copper taken up in this way is appreciable, but yet not so\r\nmuch as might be expected; the prosecutions for selling “coppered” peas\r\nin England have been based upon quantities varying from 1 to 3 grains\r\nper lb.; the highest published amount of copper found in peas\r\nartificially coloured is 0·27 per kilo., or 18·9 grains per lb.\r\n\r\nThe reason why vegetables preserve their green colour longer when\r\ntreated with a copper salt has been proved by Tschirch[869] to be owing\r\nto the formation of a phyllocyanate of copper.\r\n\r\n[869] _Das Kupfer_, Stuttgart, 1893.\r\n\r\nPhyllocyanic acid is a derivative of chlorophyll, and allied to it in\r\ncomposition; the formula of C₂₄H₂₈N₂O₄ has been ascribed to it. Under\r\nthe action of acids generally, mineral or organic, chlorophyll splits up\r\ninto this acid and other compounds. Copper phyllocyanate,\r\n(C₂₄H₂₇N₂O₄)₂Cu, contains 8·55 per cent. of copper; it forms black\r\nlamellæ, dissolving easily in strong alcohol and chloroform, but\r\ninsoluble in water; it is a little soluble in ether, insoluble in\r\npetroleum ether, and dissolved neither by dilute acetic acid, nor by\r\ndilute nor concentrated hydrochloric acid. The compound dissolves in\r\ncaustic alkali on warming. In alcohol it forms a beautiful\r\nnon-fluorescent solution. A solution of 1 : 100,000 is still coloured\r\nstrongly green.\r\n\r\nThis solution, in a stratum of 25 mm. thick, gives four absorption bands\r\nwhen submitted to spectroscopic observation, and Tschirch has worked out\r\na process of estimation of the amount of copper phyllocyanate based upon\r\nthe disappearance of these bands on dilution.\r\n\r\nGreen substances, so carefully treated that they only contain\r\nphyllocyanate of copper, would yield but small quantities of copper, and\r\nprobably they would not be injurious to health; but the coppering is\r\nusually more extensive, and copper leguminate and other compounds are\r\nformed; for the vegetables, when exhausted by alcohol, give a residue\r\nwhich, successively exhausted by water, by soda-lye, and lastly by\r\nhydrochloric acid, parts with copper into the three solvents mentioned.\r\n\r\nIt might be argued that, from the insoluble character of the\r\nphyllocyanate of copper, and especially seeing that it does not dissolve\r\nin strong hydrochloric acid, that it would be perfectly innocuous; but\r\nTschirch has proved that, whether the tartrate of copper (dissolving\r\neasily in water), or copper oxide (not dissolving at all in water, but\r\nsoluble in hydrochloric acid), or phyllocyanate of copper (insoluble\r\nboth in water and in hydrochloric acid) be used, the physiological\r\neffect is the same.\r\n\r\nCopper may be found in spirits, owing to the use of copper condensers, a\r\nremark which applies also to the essential oils, such as _oleum\r\ncajepute_, _menthæ_, &c.[870] In France, it has been added fraudulently\r\nto absinthe, to improve its colour.[871] Green sweetmeats, green toys,\r\ngreen papers, have all been found to contain definite compounds of\r\ncopper to a dangerous extent.\r\n\r\n[870] According to Eulenberg (_Gewerbe Hygiene_, p. 716), _Oleum\r\ncajepute_, _Menth. pip._, _Melissæ_, _Tanaceti_, &c., are almost always\r\ncontaminated with copper.\r\n\r\n[871] Tardieu, _Étude Méd. Lég. sur l’Empoisonnement_.\r\n\r\n§ 801. =Preparations of Copper used in Medicine and the Arts.=\r\n\r\n(1) =Medicinal Preparations=:--\r\n\r\n=Sulphate of Copper=, =Cupri Sulphas=, CuSO₄5H₂O.--This well-known salt\r\nis soluble in water at ordinary temperature, 3 parts of water dissolving\r\n1 of the sulphate; but boiling water dissolves double its weight; 1 part\r\nof copper sulphate dissolves in 2½ of glycerin; it reddens litmus, and\r\nis slightly efflorescent; its solution responds to all the usual tests\r\nfor copper and sulphuric acid. A watery solution of the salt to which\r\ntwice its volume of a solution of chlorine has been added, gives, when\r\ntreated with ammonia in excess, a clear sapphire-blue solution, leaving\r\nnothing undissolved, and thus showing the absence of iron. Besides\r\niron, sulphate of copper has been found to contain zincic sulphate.\r\n\r\n=Nitrate of Copper=, Cu(NO₃)₂3H₂O, is officinal; it is very soluble.\r\n\r\n=Cuprum Aluminatum.=--A preparation, called cuprum aluminatum (_Pierre\r\ndivine_), is in use in France and Germany, chiefly as an external wash.\r\nIt is composed of 16 parts cupric sulphate, 16 potassic nitrate, 16\r\nalum, fused in a crucible, a little camphor being afterwards added.\r\n\r\nRegular and irregular medical practitioners, veterinary surgeons,\r\nfarriers, and grooms, all use sulphate of copper (bluestone) as an\r\napplication to wounds. Copper as an _internal_ remedy is not in favour\r\neither with quacks or vendors of patent medicines. The writer has not\r\nyet found any patent pill or liquid containing it.\r\n\r\n(2) =Copper in the Arts.=--Copper is used very extensively in the arts;\r\nit enters into the composition of a number of alloys, is one of the\r\nchief constituents of the common bronzing powders, is contained in many\r\nof the lilac and purple fires of the pyrotechnist, and in a great\r\nvariety of pigments. The last-mentioned, being of special importance,\r\nwill be briefly described:--\r\n\r\n=Pigments=:--\r\n\r\n=Schweinfurt and Scheele’s Green=[872] are respectively the\r\naceto-arsenite and the arsenite of copper (see article “Arsenic”).\r\n\r\n[872] The synonyms for Schweinfurt green are extremely numerous:--Mitic\r\ngreen, Viennic green, imperial green, emerald green, are the principal\r\nterms in actual use.\r\n\r\n=Brighton Green= is a mixture of impure acetate of copper and chalk.\r\n\r\n=Brunswick Green=, originally a crude chloride of copper, is now\r\ngenerally a mixture of carbonate of copper and chalk or alumina.\r\n\r\n=Mountain Green=, or =Mineral Green=, is the native green carbonate of\r\ncopper, either with or without a little orpiment.\r\n\r\n=Neuwieder Green= is either the same as mountain green, or Schweinfurt\r\ngreen mixed with gypsum or sulphate of baryta.\r\n\r\n=Green Verditer= is a mixture of oxide and carbonate of copper with\r\nchalk.\r\n\r\n=Verdigris= is an acetate of copper, or a mixture of acetates. Its\r\nformula is usually represented as (C₂H₃O₂)CuO. It is much used in the\r\narts, and to some extent as an external application in medicine. Its\r\nmost frequent impurities or adulterations are chalk and sulphate of\r\ncopper.\r\n\r\n§ 802. =Dose--Medicinal Dose of Copper.=--Since sulphate of copper is\r\npractically the only salt administered internally, the dose is generally\r\nexpressed as so many grains of sulphate. This salt is given in\r\nquantities of from ·016 to ·129 grm. (¼ to 2 grains) as an astringent or\r\ntonic; as an emetic, from ·324 to ·648 grm. (5 to 10 grains).\r\n\r\nThe sulphate of copper is given to horses and cattle in such large\r\ndoses as from 30 up to 120 grains (1·9 to 7·7 grms.); to sheep, from\r\n1·3 to 2·6 grms. (20 to 40 grains); rabbits, ·0648 to ·1296 grm. (1 to 2\r\ngrains).\r\n\r\n§ 803. =Effects of Soluble Copper Salts on Animals.=--Harnack has made\r\nsome experiments on animals with an alkaline tartrate of copper, which\r\nhas no local action, nor does it precipitate albumin. ½ to ¾ mgrm. of\r\ncopper oxide in this form, administered subcutaneously, was fatal to\r\nfrogs, ·05 grm. to rabbits, ·4 grm. to dogs. The direct excitability of\r\nthe voluntary muscles was gradually extinguished, and death took place\r\nfrom heart paralysis. Vomiting was only noticed when the poison was\r\nadministered by the stomach.[873] The temperature of animals poisoned by\r\ncopper, sinks, according to the researches of F. A. Falck, many degrees.\r\nThese observations are in agreement with the effects of copper salts on\r\nman, and with the experiments of Orfila, Blake, C. Ph. Falck, and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n[873] On the other hand, Brunton and West have observed vomiting\r\nproduced in animals after injection of copper peptone into the jugular\r\nvein.--_Barth. Hosp. Rep._, 1877, xii.\r\n\r\nRoger[874] experimented on the effect of copper leguminate which was\r\nadministered subcutaneously; he found gradual increasing paralysis of\r\nthe motor spinal tracts, which finally destroyed life by paralysis of\r\nthe breathing centre. The heart beat after the breathing had stopped.\r\nThe irritability and contractility of the muscles of frogs were lost,\r\nwhile sensibility remained. He also found that, if the copper was\r\ninjected into the intestinal vessels, the dose had to be doubled in\r\norder to destroy life; this is, doubtless, because the liver, as it\r\nwere, strained the copper off and excreted it through the bile. Roger\r\nwas unable to destroy life by large doses of copper given by the mouth,\r\nfor then vomiting supervened and the poison in great part was removed.\r\n\r\n[874] _Revue de Médecine_, 1877, xii.\r\n\r\nBernatzic[875] considers that the poisonous properties of copper are\r\nsimilar to those of zinc and silver. He says: “Silver, copper, and zinc\r\nare, in their medicinal application, so much allied that, with regard to\r\ntheir action, they graduate one into the other and show only minor\r\ndifferences; copper, which is a little the more poisonous of the three\r\nso far as its remote action is concerned, stands between the other two.\r\nIf taken, in not too small a quantity, for a long time, the functional\r\nactivity of the muscular and nervous systems is influenced injuriously,\r\nthe development of the animal cells is inhibited, the number of the red\r\nblood corpuscles decreased, and therefore the oxidising process and\r\nmetabolism are likewise diminished, leading ultimately to a condition of\r\nmarked cachexia. . . . From a toxic point of view, the three metals\r\nnamed also stand near each other, and their compounds differ from other\r\nmetals injurious to the organism in this, that they do not produce\r\nnotable changes of the tissues or coarse functional disturbances leading\r\nto death as other poisonous metals, and therefore are not to be\r\nconsidered poisons in the same sense as lead, mercury, arsenic,\r\nantimony, phosphorus are considered poisons; for, on stopping the entry\r\nof the poison, any injurious effect is completely recovered from and the\r\nfunctions again become normal.”\r\n\r\n[875] _Encycloped. d. ges. Heilkunde_, xi. S. 429.\r\n\r\nLehmann[876] has also experimented on the effects of copper; his\r\nexperiments were made on both animals and men. He found that small\r\nquantities were more thoroughly absorbed than medium or large doses; the\r\nmethod of separation appeared to be different in different\r\nanimals--thus, the chief copper-excreting organ in dogs is the liver; in\r\nrabbits, the intestine; and in man, the kidneys. Of 3 mgrms. of copper\r\ntaken by a man in three days, 1 mgrm., or a third, was recovered from\r\nthe urine. Lehmann experimented on 6 rabbits, 4 cats, and 1 dog. During\r\nthe first few days the animals were given 10 to 30 mgrms. of copper, in\r\nthe form of a salt, in their food; then the dose was raised to 50 mgrms.\r\nor even to 100 mgrms., and the experiment continued for from two to four\r\nmonths; in one case, six months. The sulphate, acetate, chloride,\r\noleate, butyrate, and lactate were all tried, but no essential\r\ndifference in action discovered. Apart from slight vomiting, and in a\r\nfew cases, as shown by _post-mortem_, a slight catarrh of the stomach,\r\nthe animals remained well. A few increased in weight. Nervous symptoms,\r\ncramps, convulsions, diarrhœa, or the reverse, were not observed. The\r\nanalysis of the organs showed considerable copper absorption; the liver\r\nof the cats gave a mean amount of 12 mgrms. of copper, and in the other\r\norgans there was more copper than is found in cases of acute poisoning.\r\n\r\n[876] _Münch. med. Wochenschrift_, 1891, Nr. 35 u. 36.\r\n\r\nLehmann has also made experiments upon himself and his pupils on the\r\neffect of the sulphate and the acetate when taken for a long time:--\r\n\r\n  One of the experimenters took     for 50 days 10 mgrms. daily Cu as\r\n                                                               sulphate.\r\n   „           „             „ then for 30  „   20   „            „\r\n  Another took      for  3 days                   5 mgrms. as acetate.\r\n      „        then for 10 days                  10  „           „\r\n      „          „       1 day                   15  „           „\r\n      „          „      19 days                  20  „           „\r\n      „          „      18 days                  30  „           „\r\n\r\nNone of these daily doses had the least effect.\r\n\r\nFive farther experiments showed that 75 to 127 mgrms. of copper in peas\r\nand beans, divided in two meals, could be taken daily without effect;\r\nbut if 127 mgrms. were taken at one meal in 200 grms. of peas, then,\r\nafter a few hours, there might be vomiting; and Lehmann concludes that\r\ndoses of copper in food of about 100 mgrms. may produce some transient\r\nderangement in health, such as sickness, a nasty taste in the mouth, and\r\na general feeling of discomfort, but nothing more; some slight colicky\r\npains and one or two loose motions are also possible, but were not\r\nobserved in Lehmann’s experiments.\r\n\r\n§ 804. =Toxic Dose of Copper Salts.=--This is a difficult question,\r\nbecause copper salts generally act as an emetic, and therefore very\r\nlarge doses have been taken without any great injury. In fact, it may be\r\nlaid down that a medium dose taken daily for a considerable time is far\r\nmore likely to injure health, or to destroy life, than a big dose taken\r\nat once. In Tschirch’s[877] careful experiments on animals, he found 10\r\nmgrm. doses of CuO given daily to rabbits, the weight of which varied\r\nfrom 1200 to 1650 grms., caused injury to health, that is, about 3·5\r\nmgrms. per kilo. If man is susceptible in the same proportion, then\r\ndaily doses of 227·5 mgrms. (or about 3½ grains) would cause serious\r\npoisonous symptoms; although double or treble that quantity might in a\r\nsingle dose be swallowed and, if thrown up speedily, no great harm\r\nresult. 120 grms. of sulphate of copper have been swallowed, and yet the\r\npatient recovered after an illness of two weeks.[878] Lewin[879]\r\nmentions the case of an adult who recovered after ten days’ illness,\r\nalthough the dose was 15 grms.; there is also on record the case of a\r\nchild, four and a half years old, who recovered after a dose of 16·5\r\ngrms. (a little over half an ounce). On the other hand, 7·7 grms. have\r\nbeen with difficulty recovered from.[880] A woman died in seventy-two\r\nhours after taking 27 grms. (7 drms.) of copper sulphate mixed with 11·6\r\ngrms. (3 drms.) of iron sulphide; 56·6 grms. (2 ozs.) of copper acetate\r\nhave caused death in three days; 14·2 grms. (0·5 oz.) in sixty\r\nhours.[881]\r\n\r\n[877] _Das Kupfer_, Stuttgart, 1893.\r\n\r\n[878] Referred to by Bernatzic, on the authority of Ketli, in _Encycl.\r\nd. ges. Heilkunde_, xi.

The symptoms produced by the sulphate of\r\ncopper are those of a powerful irritant poison: there is immediate and\r\nviolent vomiting; the vomited matters are of a greenish colour--a green\r\ndistinguished from bile by the colour changing to blue on the addition\r\nof ammonia. There is pain in the stomach, and in a little time\r\naffections of the nervous system, as shown by spasms, cramps, paralysis,\r\nand even tetanus. Jaundice is a frequent symptom, if life is prolonged\r\nsufficiently to admit of its occurrence.\r\n\r\nOne of the best examples of acute poisoning by copper sulphate is\r\nrecorded by Maschka.[882] A youth, sixteen years old, took an unknown\r\nlarge dose of powdered copper sulphate, mixed with water. Half an hour\r\nafterwards there was violent vomiting, and he was taken to the hospital.\r\nThere was thirst, retching, constriction in the throat, a coppery taste\r\nin the mouth, and pain in the epigastrium, which was painful on\r\npressure. The vomit was of a blue colour, and small undissolved crystals\r\nof copper sulphate were obtained from it. The patient was pale, the\r\nedges of the lips and the angles of the mouth were coloured blue, the\r\nsurface of the tongue had also a blue tint, the temperature was\r\ndepressed, the extremities cold, nails cyanotic, and the pulse small and\r\nquick. Several loose greenish-yellow evacuations were passed; there was\r\nno blood. The urine was scanty, but contained neither blood nor albumen.\r\nDuring the night the patient was very restless; the next morning he had\r\nviolent headache, pain in the epigastrium, burning in the mouth and\r\ngullet, but no vomiting. The urine was scanty, contained blood, albumen,\r\nand colouring matter from the bile. On the fourth day there was marked\r\njaundice. The mucous membrane was very pale, the temperature low, pulse\r\nfrequent, and great weakness, cardiac oppression, and restlessness were\r\nexperienced. There were diarrhœa and tenesmus, the motions being\r\nstreaked with blood; the urine also contained much blood. The liver was\r\nenlarged. The patient died in a state of collapse on the seventh day.\r\n\r\n[882] _Wiener med. Wochenschr._, 1871, Nro. 26, p. 628.\r\n\r\nIn 1836 a girl, sixteen months old, was given bluestone to play with,\r\nand ate an unknown quantity; a quarter of an hour afterwards the child\r\nwas violently sick, vomiting a bluish-green liquid containing some\r\npieces of sulphate of copper. Death took place in four hours, without\r\nconvulsions, and without diarrhœa.\r\n\r\n§ 806. =Subacetate of Copper, Subchloride, and Carbonate=, all act very\r\nsimilarly to the sulphate when given in large doses.\r\n\r\n§ 807. =Post-mortem Appearances.=--In Maschka’s case, the chief changes\r\nnoted were in the liver, kidneys, and stomach. The substance of the\r\nliver was friable and fatty; in the gall-bladder there were but a few\r\ndrops of dark tenacious bile. The kidneys were swollen, the cortical\r\nsubstance coloured yellow, the pyramids compressed and pale brown. In\r\nthe mucous membrane of the stomach there was an excoriation the size of\r\na shilling, in which the epithelium was changed into a dirty brown mass,\r\neasily detached, laying bare the muscular substance beneath, but\r\notherwise normal.\r\n\r\nIn a case of poisoning by verdigris (subacetate of copper) recorded by\r\nOrfila,[883] the stomach was so much inflamed and thickened that\r\ntowards the pyloric end the opening into the intestine was almost\r\nobliterated. The small intestines throughout were inflamed, and\r\nperforation had taken place, so that part of the green liquid had\r\nescaped into the abdomen. The large intestines were distended in some\r\nparts, contracted in others, and there was ulceration of the rectum. In\r\nother cases a striking discoloration of the mucous membrane, being\r\nchanged by the contact of the salt to a dirty bluish-green, has been\r\nnoticed, and, when present, will afford valuable indications.\r\n\r\n[883] _Toxicologie_, vol. i. p. 787 (5th ed.).\r\n\r\n§ 808. =Chronic Poisoning by Copper.=--Symptoms have arisen among\r\nworkers in copper or its salts, and also from the use of food\r\naccidentally contaminated by copper, which lend support to the existence\r\nof chronic poisoning. In the symptoms there is a very great resemblance\r\nto those produced by lead. There is a green line on the margin of the\r\ngums. Dr. Clapton[884] found the line very distinct in a sailor and two\r\nworking coppersmiths, and the two men were also seen by Dr. Taylor.\r\nCases of chronic poisoning among coppersmiths have also been treated by\r\nDr. Cameron,[885] but this symptom was not noticed. Corrigan speaks of\r\nthe line round the gums, but describes it as purple-red. Among workers\r\nin copper, Lancereaux[886] has seen a black coloration of the mucous\r\nmembrane of the digestive canal; its chemical characters appear to agree\r\nwith those of carbon.\r\n\r\n[884] _Med. Times and Gazette_, June 1868, p. 658.\r\n\r\n[885] _Med. Times and Gazette_, 1870, vol. i. p. 581.\r\n\r\n[886] _Atlas of Pathological Anatomy._\r\n\r\nMetallic copper itself is not poisonous. A Mr. Charles Reed has\r\npublished a letter in the _Chemical News_ of Jan. 12, 1894, stating that\r\nhe was, when a boy, wounded in the shin by a copper percussion-cap, and\r\nthe cap remained in the tissues; it was removed from the shin after a\r\nsojourn thereof some twelve years; about the year 1873 he noticed that\r\nwhenever a piece of clean iron or steel came in contact with his\r\nperspiration it was at once covered with a bright coating of copper, and\r\nthis continued until the percussion-cap was removed. Presuming the truth\r\nof this, it shows conclusively that metallic copper deposited in the\r\ntissues is in itself not poisonous, and farther, that one method of\r\nelimination is by the skin. The experiments already cited throw doubt as\r\nto whether repeated small doses of copper taken for a long time produce\r\nin a scientific sense chronic poisoning; those which apparently support\r\nthe view that there is such a thing as chronic poisoning by copper, have\r\nbeen produced by copper mixed with other metals; and there is the\r\npossibility that these cases are really due to lead or arsenic, and not\r\nto copper. The great use of late years of solutions of copper sulphate\r\nas a dressing to plants, for the purpose of preventing the ravages of\r\nvarious parasites, has provided, so far as animals are concerned, much\r\nmaterial for the judgment of this question. Sheep have been fed with\r\nvines which have been treated with copper sulphate, oxen and pigs have\r\nconsumed for a long time grass treated with a 3 per cent. of copper\r\nsulphate, without the least health disturbance. Mach[887] has fed cows\r\nwith green food coppered up to 200 mgrms. of copper sulphate, without\r\nobserving the slightest bad effect, for long periods of time; and\r\nTschirch[888] summarises the evidence as to chronic poisoning as\r\nfollows:--“So it appears the contention that there is no chronic\r\npoisoning in men or animals is at present uncontradicted; it is farther\r\nto be considered proved that the small amounts of copper naturally in\r\nfood, or carefully introduced into food, are not injurious to the health\r\nof those that take such food, because the liver, kidneys, and other\r\norgans excrete the copper through the urine and bile, and prevent a\r\npernicious accumulation.” At the same time, Tschirch does not consider\r\nthe question is definitely settled; the experiments should, he thinks,\r\nhave been continued not for months, but for years, to obtain a\r\ntrustworthy judgment.\r\n\r\n[887] Mach, _Bericht über die Ergebnisse der im Jahre 1886 ausgeführten\r\nVersuche zur Bekämpfung der Peronospora_, St. Michele, Tyrol.\r\n\r\n[888] _Op. cit._\r\n\r\nIt may also be remarked that, if we are to rely upon the separation of\r\ncopper by the kidneys and the liver, those organs are presumed to be in\r\na healthy state, which is not the case with a percentage of the\r\npopulation; to persons whose liver or kidneys are unsound, even the\r\nsmall amounts of copper found in “coppered” peas may act as a poison,\r\nand the experiments previously detailed throw no light upon the action\r\nof copper under such circumstances.\r\n\r\n§ 809. =Detection and Estimation of Copper.=--Copper may occur either in\r\nthe routine process of precipitating by SH₂, or it may, as is generally\r\nthe case, be searched for specially. If copper is looked for in a\r\nprecipitate produced by SH₂, it is taken for granted that the\r\nprecipitate has first been treated successively by carbonate of ammonia,\r\nsulphide of sodium, and hydrochloric acid; in other words, arsenic,\r\nantimony, and lead have been removed. The moist precipitate is now\r\ntreated with warm nitric acid, which dissolves out copper sulphide with\r\nseparation of sulphur; if there is sufficient copper, the fluid shows a\r\nblue colour, which of itself is an indication of copper being present.\r\nThe further tests are--(1) Ammonia gives a deeper blue; (2) ferrocyanide\r\nof potash a brown-red colour or precipitate; (3) a few drops mixed with\r\na solution of tartrate of soda, alkalised with sodic hydrate, and boiled\r\nwith a crystal or two of grape-sugar, gives quickly a red precipitate of\r\noxide of copper; (4) a needle or a clean iron wire, or any simple\r\ngalvanic combination, immersed in, or acting on, the liquid, soon\r\nbecomes coated with the very characteristic reddish metallic film.\r\nVarious other tests might be mentioned, but the above are ample.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecial Examinations for Copper.\r\n\r\n(1) =In Water and Liquids generally.=--The liquid may be concentrated,\r\nand the copper separated by electrolysis. A simple method is to place\r\nthe liquid in a large platinum dish, and insert a piece of zinc, adding\r\na sufficient quantity of ClH to dissolve the zinc entirely; the copper\r\nis found as an adherent film on the inner surface of the dish. It is\r\nneater, however, and more accurate, to connect the platinum dish with\r\nthe negative plate of a battery, suspending in the liquid the positive\r\nelectrode. The modifications of this method are numerous; some chemists\r\nuse (especially for small quantities of copper) two small platinum\r\nelectrodes, either of foil or of wire, and on obtaining the film, weigh\r\nthe electrode, then dissolve the copper off by nitric acid, and\r\nre-weigh. Such solid substances as peas are conveniently mashed up into\r\na paste with water and ClH; an aliquot part is carefully weighed and put\r\nin a platinum dish, connected, as before described, with a battery; at\r\nthe end of from twelve to twenty-four hours all the copper is deposited,\r\nand the dish with its film dried and weighed. The weight of the clean\r\ndish, _minus_ the coppered dish, of course equals the copper. Fat and\r\noils are best thoroughly washed with hot acid water, which will, if\r\nproperly performed, extract all the copper. By the use of separating\r\nfunnels and wet filters, the fat or oil can be separated from the watery\r\nliquid.\r\n\r\nA galvanic test has been proposed, which is certainly very delicate,\r\n1/100 of a mgrm. in solution being recognised with facility. A zinc\r\nplatinum couple is made with two wires; on leaving this in an acid\r\nliquid containing a mere trace of copper, after several hours the\r\nplatinum will be found discoloured. If the discoloration is from copper,\r\non exposing the wire to hydrobromic acid fumes (easily produced from the\r\naction of potassic bromide and sulphuric acid) and bromine, the wire\r\nwill become of a violet colour. This colour is easily recognised by\r\nrubbing the wire on a piece of porcelain.[889]\r\n\r\n[889] _Chem. News_, Nov. 30, 1877.\r\n\r\n(2) =Animal Matters=, such as the liver, brain, spinal cord, &c., are\r\nbest entirely burnt to an ash, and the copper looked for in the\r\nlatter.[890] The same remark applies to bread and substances consisting\r\nalmost entirely of starchy matters. Any injurious quantity of copper\r\ncan, however, be extracted with hydrochloric acid and water; and,\r\nalthough this method of extraction is not quite so accurate, it is\r\nquicker.\r\n\r\n[890] In exhumation of long buried bodies, it may be necessary to know\r\nthe composition of the soil. Sonnenschein mentions a skull, now in the\r\nmuseum at Madrid, which was dug out of an old Roman mine, and is quite\r\ngreen from copper compounds.--Sonnenschein’s _Handbuch_, p. 83.\r\n\r\n§ 810. =Volumetric Processes for the Estimation of Copper.=--A number of\r\nvolumetric processes have been devised for the estimation of copper, but\r\nfor the purposes of this work it is unnecessary to detail them. When\r\ncopper is in too small a quantity to be weighed, it may then be\r\nestimated by a colorimetric process.\r\n\r\nOne of the best of these is based upon the brown colour which\r\nferrocyanide of potash produces in very dilute solutions of copper. A\r\nstandard copper solution is obtained by dissolving sulphate of copper in\r\na litre of water, so that each c.c. contains 0·1 mgrm. Cu, and a\r\nsolution of ferrocyanide of potash in water is prepared, strength 4 per\r\ncent. It is also convenient to have a solution of nitrate of ammonia,\r\nwhich is found to render the reaction much more delicate.\r\n\r\nThe further details are on the well-known lines of colorimetric\r\nestimations.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. BISMUTH.\r\n\r\n§ 811. =Bismuth=, Bi = 210; sp. gr., 9·799; fusing-point, 264° (507·2°\r\nF.).--Bismuth, as obtained in the course of analysis, is either a black\r\nmetallic powder or an extremely brittle bead of a reddish-white colour.\r\nThe compounds which it will be necessary to briefly notice are the\r\nperoxide and tersulphide.\r\n\r\n§ 812. =The peroxide of bismuth=, Bi₂O₃ = 468; sp. gr., 8·211; Bi, 89·64\r\nper cent., O, 10·36 per cent., as prepared by igniting the carbonate or\r\nnitrate, is a pale lemon coloured powder, which can be fused without\r\nloss of weight, but is reduced on charcoal, or in a stream of carbon\r\ndioxide, to the metallic state. It is also reduced by fusion with\r\npotassic cyanide or by ignition with ammonium chloride.\r\n\r\n§ 813. =The Sulphide of Bismuth=, Bi₂S₃ = 516; Bi, 81·25 per cent., S,\r\n18·75 per cent., occurs, in the course of analysis, as a brownish-black\r\nor quite black precipitate, insoluble in water, dilute acids, alkalies,\r\nalkaline sulphides, sulphate of soda, and cyanide of potassium, but\r\ndissolving in moderately concentrated nitric acid with separation of\r\nsulphur. It continually increases in weight when dried in the ordinary\r\nway, and is completely reduced when fused with cyanide of potassium.\r\n\r\n§ 814. =Preparations of Bismuth used in Medicine and the Arts.=\r\n\r\n(1) =Pharmaceutical Preparations=:--\r\n\r\n=Bismuthi Subnitras=, BiONO₃.H₂O.--A heavy white powder, insoluble in\r\nwater, and responding to the usual tests for bismuth and nitric acid.\r\nThe formula should yield 77 per cent. of bismuth oxide. Commercial\r\npreparations, however, vary from 79 to 82 per cent.\r\n\r\n=Bismuth Lozenges= (=Trochisci bismuthi=) are composed of subnitrate of\r\nbismuth, magnesia carbonate, precipitated lime carbonate, sugar, and\r\ngum, mixed with rose water. Each lozenge should contain 0·13 grm. (2\r\ngrains) of subnitrate of bismuth.\r\n\r\n=Solution of Citrate of Bismuth and Ammonia= (=Liquor Bismuthi et\r\nAmmoniæ citratis=), a colourless neutral or slightly alkaline fluid, sp.\r\ngr. 1·07, responding to the tests for bismuth and ammonia. As an\r\nimpurity lead may be present, citric acid being so frequently\r\ncontaminated with lead. Carbonate of bismuth (_Bismuthi carbonas_),\r\n(Bi₂O₂CO₃)₂H₂O is a fine white powder answering to the tests for carbon\r\ndioxide and bismuth; it should yield 89·1 per cent. of bismuth oxide.\r\n\r\n=A Nitrate of Bismuth=, Bi(NO₃)₃, an oleate of bismuth, an oxide of\r\nbismuth, a subgallate of bismuth (_dermatol_), and a subiodide of\r\nbismuth are also used in medicine.\r\n\r\n(2) =Bismuth in the Arts.=[891]\r\n\r\n[891] Bismuth is contained in all copper coinage--from the Bactrian\r\ncoins to our own; in all cupreous ores, except the carbonates, and in\r\nnearly all specimens of commercial copper.--Field, _Chem. News_, xxxvi.\r\n261.\r\n\r\nThe chief use of bismuth is in alloys and solders. The Chromate is\r\nemployed in calico-printing, and the subnitrate as a paint under the\r\nname of pearl-white.\r\n\r\nThe salts of bismuth also occur in washes for the hair, and pearl-white\r\nis used as a cosmetic, but only to a small extent.\r\n\r\n§ 815. =Medicinal Doses of Bismuth.=--The subnitrate and carbonate are\r\nprescribed in doses from ·0648 to 1·296 grm. (1 to 20 grains); the\r\nvalerianate, from ·1296 to ·648 grm. (2 to 10 grains); and the solution,\r\nfrom 1·7 c.c. to 5·2 c.c. (½ drachm to 1½ drachm).\r\n\r\n§ 816. =Toxic Effects of Bismuth.=--From the researches of Meyer and\r\nSteinfeld[892] on animals, it appears that if birds or mammals are\r\npoisoned with bismuth salts introduced subcutaneously, or by direct\r\ninjection, into the veins, death follows in from twenty-four to\r\nforty-eight hours, the fatal issue being preceded by convulsions; after\r\ndeath, the colon is intensely blackened, and it may be ulcerated, while\r\nthe small intestines and the stomach are healthy. If, however, sulphur\r\npreparations are given by the mouth, there is then blackening of the\r\nstomach, and there may also be ulcers. Meyer is of the opinion that SH₂\r\nprecipitates bismuth in the parenchyma, and the particles occluding the\r\ncapillaries thus cause small local necroses; that which escapes\r\nprecipitation is mainly excreted by the kidneys. Poisonous symptoms in\r\nman have been known to occur from the treatment of wounds with bismuth\r\npreparations;[893] the symptoms have been somewhat similar to mercurial\r\npoisoning; there have been noticed stomatitis with salivation, loosening\r\nof the teeth, a black colour of the mucous membrane of the mouth and\r\nulceration, also catarrh of the intestines, and the inflammatory\r\ncondition of the kidneys usual when that organ has to excrete metallic\r\nsubstances not natural to the body, the “metallniere,” or metal kidney,\r\nof the German writers. One case is recorded of death in nine days of an\r\nadult after taking 7·7 grms. (2 drms.) of bismuth subnitrate. The\r\nrecorded symptoms were a metallic taste in the mouth, pain in the\r\nthroat, vomiting, purging, coldness of the surface, and spasms of the\r\narms and legs. A _post-mortem_ examination showed inflammatory changes\r\nin the gullet, windpipe, and throughout the intestinal canal. Recovery\r\nhas, however, taken place from a single dose three times the amount\r\nmentioned. It is possible that the fatal case was due to impure bismuth.\r\n\r\n[892] L.

Without denying the\r\npossibility of its existing in a soluble state in the saliva, its\r\npresence in the mouth may, under such circumstances, be ascribed to the\r\nlodgment of particles of subnitrate or subcarbonate of bismuth in the\r\ninterstices of the teeth, &c. It will then be evident that, if a person\r\nis supposed to have been poisoned by a large dose of bismuth, and the\r\nanalyst fail to find it in the stomach, the contents of the bowels\r\nshould be next examined.\r\n\r\nThe extraction of bismuth must be undertaken by nitric acid, and boiling\r\nfor at least two hours may be necessary to dissolve it out from the\r\ntissues. Such organs as the liver and spleen are boiled in a finely\r\ndivided state with a litre of dilute nitric acid (strength, 5 per\r\ncent.), for the time mentioned, filtered, and the filtrate evaporated to\r\ndryness; the remainder is then carbonised by strong nitric acid; and,\r\nfinally, the charcoal is boiled with equal parts of nitric acid and\r\nwater, and the whole evaporated to dryness. By this method every trace\r\nof bismuth is extracted. The dry residue may now be brought into\r\nsolution, and tested for bismuth. The best solvent for the nitrate of\r\nbismuth is dilute nitric acid 50 per cent.; the dry residue is therefore\r\ndissolved in 100 or 200 c.c. of the acid, and fractional parts taken for\r\nexamination:--\r\n\r\n(1) The solution, poured into a large volume of warm distilled water,\r\ngives a crystalline precipitate of subnitrate of bismuth. The only metal\r\ngiving a similar reaction is antimony, and this is excluded by the\r\nmethod employed.\r\n\r\n(2) The filtered fluid gives on addition of sodic chloride a precipitate\r\nof oxychloride. This, again, is distinguished from oxychloride of\r\nantimony by its insolubility in tartaric acid.\r\n\r\n(3) Any bismuth precipitate, fused with soda on charcoal, gives a\r\nbrittle bead of bismuth; the coal is coated whilst warm a dark\r\norange-yellow, on cooling citron-yellow.\r\n\r\n(4) The bead may be identified by powdering it, placing it in a short\r\nsubliming tube, and passing over it dry chlorine. The powder first turns\r\nblack, then melts to an amber-yellow fluid, and finally, by prolonged\r\nheating, sublimes as terchloride of bismuth.\r\n\r\n(5) A very delicate test proposed by Abel and Field, in 1862,[894]\r\nspecially for the detection of bismuth in copper (but by no means\r\nconfined to mineral analysis), utilises the fact that, if iodide of lead\r\nbe precipitated from a fluid containing the least trace of bismuth,\r\ninstead of the yellow iodide the scales assume a dark orange to a\r\ncrimson tint. A solution of nitrate of lead is used; to the nitric acid\r\nsolution ammonia and carbonate of ammonia added; the precipitate washed,\r\nand dissolved in acetic acid; and, finally, excess of iodide of\r\npotassium added. It is said that thus so small a quantity as ·00025 grm.\r\nmay be detected in copper with the greatest ease, the iodide of lead\r\nbecoming dark orange; ·001 grain imparts a reddish-brown tinge, and ·01\r\ngrain a crimson.\r\n\r\n[894] _Journ. Chem. Soc._, 1862, vol. xiv. p. 290; _Chem. News_, vol.\r\nxxxvi. p. 261.\r\n\r\n(6) A solution of a bismuth salt, which must contain no free HCl, when\r\ntreated with 10 parts of water, 2 of potassium iodide, and 1 part of\r\ncinchonine, gives a red orange precipitate of cinchonine\r\niod.-bismuth.[895]\r\n\r\n[895] E. Légar, _Bull. de la Soc. Chim._, vol. iv., 1888, 91.\r\n\r\n(7) Van Kobell’s test, as modified by Hutchings,[896] and proposed more\r\nespecially for the detection of bismuth in minerals, is capable of being\r\napplied to any solid compound suspected of containing the metal:--A\r\nmixture of precipitated and purified cuprous iodide, with an equal\r\nvolume of flowers of sulphur, is prepared, and 2 parts of this mixture\r\nare made into a paste with 1 part of the substance, and heated on a slip\r\nof charcoal on an aluminium support by the blowpipe flame. If bismuth be\r\npresent, the red bismuth iodide will sublime, and on clean aluminium is\r\neasily distinguishable.\r\n\r\n[896] _Chem. News_, vol. xxxvi. p. 249.\r\n\r\nThere are many other tests, but the above are sufficient.\r\n\r\n§ 818. =Estimation of Bismuth.=--The estimation of bismuth, when in any\r\nquantity easily weighed, is, perhaps, best accomplished by fusing the\r\nsulphide, oxide, or other compound of bismuth, in a porcelain crucible\r\nwith cyanide of potassium; the bismuth is reduced to the metallic state,\r\nthe cyanide can be dissolved out, and the metallic powder washed (first\r\nwith water, lastly with spirit), dried, and weighed.\r\n\r\nMr. Pattison Muir has shown[897] that bismuth may be separated from\r\niron, aluminium, chromium, and manganese, by adding ammonia to the acid\r\nsolutions of these metals.\r\n\r\n[897] Pattison Muir on “Certain Bismuth Compounds,” _Journ. Chem. Soc._,\r\np. 7, 1876.\r\n\r\nThis observation admits of many applications, and may be usefully taken\r\nadvantage of in the separation of bismuth from the nitric acid solution\r\nof such animal matters as liver, &c. The acid liquid is partially\r\nneutralised by ammonia, and, on diluting with warm water containing a\r\nlittle sodium or ammonium chloride, the whole of the bismuth is\r\nprecipitated as oxychloride, which may be collected, and fused with\r\ncyanide of potassium, as above.\r\n\r\nIf the bismuth precipitate is in small quantity, or if a number of\r\nestimations of bismuth are to be made, it is most convenient to use a\r\nvolumetric process. In the case first mentioned, the oxychloride could\r\nbe dissolved in nitric acid, sodium acetate added in excess, and\r\nsufficient acetic acid to dissolve any precipitate which has been\r\nproduced, and then titrated by the following method, which we also owe\r\nto Mr. Pattison Muir:--\r\n\r\n=Estimation of Bismuth by Potassium Dichromate.=[898]--A solution of\r\nrecrystallised potassium dichromate (strength, 1 per cent.) is prepared.\r\nA known weight of pure bismuthous oxide (Bi₂O₃) is dissolved in excess\r\nof nitric acid, and a solution of sodium acetate is added to this liquid\r\nuntil a copious white precipitate is thrown down; acetic acid is then\r\nadded in quantity sufficient to dissolve the precipitate completely, and\r\nto insure that, when the liquid is made up with water to a fixed volume,\r\nno precipitate shall be formed. A certain volume of this liquid is\r\nwithdrawn by means of a pipette, placed in a beaker, and heated to\r\nboiling; the potassium dichromate is then gradually run in from a\r\nburette, the liquid being boiled between each addition of the solution,\r\nuntil a drop of the supernatant liquid gives a faint reddish-brown\r\ncoloration when spotted with silver nitrate on a white slab.\r\n\r\n[898] Pattison Muir on “Certain Bismuth Compounds,” _Journ. Chem. Soc._,\r\nvol. i. p. 659, 1879.\r\n\r\nAnother very generally applicable volumetric method for bismuth has been\r\nproposed by Mr. Muir.[899] This depends on the fact (observed by Sonchay\r\nand Leussen),[900] that normal bismuth oxalate splits up on boiling into\r\na basic oxalate of the composition Bi₂O₃2C₂O₃ + OH₂, but slightly\r\nsoluble in nitric acid. The process is performed by precipitating the\r\nbismuth by excess of oxalic acid, dissolving the precipitate (first\r\npurified from free oxalic acid) in dilute hydrochloric acid, and lastly,\r\ntitrating by permanganate. The absence of free hydrochloric acid before\r\nprecipitating must be insured.\r\n\r\n[899] _Ibid._, 1877.\r\n\r\n[900] _Ann. Chem. Pharm._, vol. cv. p. 245.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. SILVER.\r\n\r\n§ 819. =Silver= = 108; specific gravity, 10·5; fusing-point, 1023°\r\n(1873° F.).--Silver, as separated in analysis, is either a very white,\r\nglittering, metallic bead, or a dull grey powder. It does not lose\r\nweight on ignition, and is soluble in dilute nitric acid.\r\n\r\n§ 820. =Chloride of Silver=, AgCl = 143·5; specific gravity, 5·552; Ag,\r\n75·27 per cent., Cl, 24·73 per cent., is a dense, white, curdy\r\nprecipitate, when produced in the wet way. It is very insoluble in\r\nwater, dilute nitric acid, and dilute sulphuric acid; in many warm\r\nsolutions (especially aqueous solutions of the chlorides generally), the\r\nalkaline and alkaline-earthy nitrates, and tartaric acid solutions, the\r\nsilver is dissolved to an appreciable extent, but deposited again on\r\ndiluting and cooling. The complete solvents of chloride of silver\r\nare--ammonia, cyanide of potassium, and hyposulphite of soda. Chloride\r\nof silver cannot be fused at a high heat without some slight loss by\r\nvolatilisation; on coal in the R.F., it fuses very easily to a globule.\r\nIt can with soda be reduced to metal, and can also readily be reduced by\r\nignition in a current of hydrogen, carbon oxide, or carburetted hydrogen\r\ngas.\r\n\r\n§ 821. =Sulphide of Silver=, Ag₂S = 248; specific gravity, 7·2; Ag, 87·1\r\nper cent., S, 12·9 per cent., when prepared in the wet way, is a black\r\nprecipitate, insoluble in water, dilute acids, and alkaline sulphides.\r\nIf ignited in hydrogen it may be reduced to the metallic state; it is\r\nsoluble in nitric acid, with separation of sulphur.\r\n\r\n§ 822. =Preparations of Silver used in Medicine and the Arts.=\r\n\r\n(1) =Medicinal Preparations=:--\r\n\r\n=Nitrate of Silver=, AgNO₃; Ag, 63·51 per cent., N₂O₅, 36·49 per cent.\r\nThis salt is either sold crystallised in colourless rhombic prisms, or\r\nin the form of small white pencils or sticks. It gives the reactions for\r\nsilver and nitric acid, and stains the skin black. 100 parts, dissolved\r\nin distilled water, should give, with hydrochloric acid, a precipitate\r\nwhich, when washed and dried, weighs 83·4 parts. The silver is, however,\r\nfar more quickly estimated by the blowpipe than in the wet way. One grm.\r\nfused in a cavity on charcoal should give a little globule of metallic\r\nsilver, weighing about ·6351 grm. The chief adulterations of this\r\nsubstance are copper, lead, and nitrate of potash. If all the silver is\r\nprecipitated by hydrochloric acid, carefully filtered off, and the\r\nfiltrate evaporated to dryness, any residue will denote adulteration or\r\nimpurity.\r\n\r\n=Argenti Oxidum=, =Oxide of Silver=, Ag₂O = 232; Ag, 93·19 per cent.--A\r\ndark olive-brown powder, soluble in ammonia and nitric acid. By ignition\r\nit readily yields metallic silver. The P.B. directs that 29 grains of\r\nthe oxide should yield 27 of metallic silver.\r\n\r\n=Nitrate of Silver and Potash= (=Argentum nitricum cum kali nitrico=),\r\nAgNO₃ + KNO₃.--This preparation is in most of the pharmacopœias,\r\nAustrian, German, Danish, Swedish, Russian, Swiss, and the British; it\r\nis directed by the B.P. to be composed of 1 part of silver nitrate and\r\n1 part of potassic nitrate fused together. A “toughened silver nitrate”\r\nis made by fusing together potassic nitrate 5, silver nitrate 95. Mild\r\ncaustic points are used by oculists by fusing 1 of silver nitrate with\r\n2, 3, 3½, and 4 parts of potassic nitrate.\r\n\r\n(2) =Silver in the Arts.=--The uses of the metal in coinage, articles\r\nfor domestic purposes, for ornament, &c., are too well known to require\r\nenumeration. The only forms in which silver is likely to give rise to\r\naccident are the salts used in medicine, photography, in the dyeing of\r\nhair, and in the manufacture of marking inks.\r\n\r\n=Hair-dyes.=--About one-half of the hair-dyes in use are made with\r\nnitrate of silver. The following are only a few of the recipes:--\r\n\r\n=Aqua Orientalis.=--Grain silver 2 drms., nitric acid 1 oz., steel\r\nfilings 4 drms., distilled water 1½ oz.--the whole finally made up to 3½\r\nfluid ozs., and filtered.\r\n\r\n=Argentan Tincture.=--Nitrate of silver 1 drachm, rose water 1 fluid\r\noz., sufficient nitrate of copper to impart a greenish tint.\r\n\r\n=Eau d’Afrique.=--Two solutions--one of nitrate of silver, the other of\r\npotash, containing ammonium sulphide.\r\n\r\nThe photographer uses various salts of silver, the chief of which\r\nare--the nitrate, iodide, bromide, cyanide, and chloride of silver.\r\n\r\n=Marking Inks.=--Some of the more important recipes for marking ink are\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\nNitrate of silver 1·0 part, hot distilled water 3·6 parts, mucilage,\r\npreviously rubbed with sap-green, 1·0 part. With this is sold a\r\n“pounce,” or preparation consisting of a coloured solution of sodic\r\ncarbonate. Another preparation is very similar, but with the addition of\r\nammonia and some colouring matter, such as indigo, syrup of buckthorn,\r\nor sap-green. A third is made with tartaric acid and nitrate of silver,\r\ndissolved in ammonia solution, and coloured.\r\n\r\n=Redwood’s Ink= consists of equal parts of nitrate of silver and\r\npotassic bitartrate, dissolved in ammonia, with the addition of archil\r\ngreen and sugar; according to the formula, 100 parts should equal 16·6\r\nof silver nitrate.\r\n\r\n=Soubeiran’s Ink= is composed of cupric nitrate 3, argentic nitrate 8,\r\nsodic carbonate 4, and the whole made up to 100 parts, in solution of\r\nammonia. In one of Mr. Reade’s inks, besides silver, an ammoniacal\r\nsolution of a salt of gold is used.\r\n\r\n§ 823. =Medicinal Dose of Silver Compounds.=--The nitrate and the oxide\r\nof silver are given in doses from ·0162 to ·1296 grm. (¼ grain to 2\r\ngrains). Anything like ·1944 to ·2592 grm. (3 or 4 grains) would be\r\nconsidered a large, if not a dangerous dose; but nothing definite is\r\nknown as to what would be a _poisonous_ dose.\r\n\r\n§ 824. =Effects of Nitrate of Silver on Animals.=--Nitrate of silver is\r\nchanged into chloride by the animal fluids, and also forms a compound\r\nwith albumen. Silver chloride and silver albumenate are both somewhat\r\nsoluble in solutions containing chlorides of the alkalies, which\r\nexplains how a metallic salt, so very insoluble in water, can be\r\nabsorbed by the blood.\r\n\r\nThe action of soluble salts of silver on animals has been several times\r\ninvestigated. There appears to be some difference between its effects on\r\nwarm and cold-blooded animals. In frogs there is quickly an exaltation\r\nof the functions of the spinal cord, tetanic convulsions appear, similar\r\nto those induced by strychnine; later, there is disturbance of the\r\nrespiration and cessation of voluntary motion.\r\n\r\nThe first symptoms with dogs and cats are vomiting and diarrhœa;\r\nmuscular weakness, paralysis, disturbance of the respiration, and weak\r\nclonic convulsions follow. Rouget, as well as Curci, considers that the\r\naction of silver is directed to the central nervous system; there is\r\nfirst excitement, and then follows paralysis of the centres of\r\nrespiration and movement. Death occurs through central asphyxia.\r\nAccording to the researches of F. A. Falck, subcutaneous injections of\r\nsilver nitrate into rabbits cause a fall of temperature of 6·7° to\r\n17·6°, the last being the greatest fall which, in his numerous\r\nresearches on the effect of poisons on temperature, he has seen.\r\n\r\nChronic poisoning, according to the experiments of Bogoslowsky on\r\nanimals, produces emaciation, fatty degeneration of the liver, kidneys,\r\nand also of the muscles--a statement confirmed by others.\r\n\r\n§ 825. =Toxic Effects of Silver Nitrate in Man=--(1) =Acute\r\nPoisoning.=--This is very rare. Orfila relates an attempt at suicide;\r\nbut most of the cases have been accidental, and of these, in recent\r\ntimes, about five are recorded, mostly children. The accident is usually\r\ndue to the application of the solid nitrate to the throat, as an\r\nescharotic, the stick breaking or becoming detached, and being\r\nimmediately swallowed; such an accident is related by Scattergood.[901]\r\nA piece of silver nitrate ¾ inch long, slipped down the throat of a\r\nchild, aged fifteen months--vomiting immediately occurred, followed by\r\nconvulsions and diarrhœa; chloride of sodium was administered, but the\r\nchild died in six hours. In other cases paralysis and an unconscious\r\nstate has been observed.\r\n\r\n[901] _Brit. Med. Journal_, May 1871.\r\n\r\n(2) =Chronic Poisoning.=--Salts of silver taken for a long period cause\r\na peculiar and indelible colour of the skin, the body becomes of a\r\ngreyish-blue to black colour, it begins first around the nails and\r\nfingers, then patches of a similar hue appear in different parts of the\r\nbody, and gradually coalesce, being most marked in those parts exposed\r\nto the light. The colour is not confined to the outer skin, but is also\r\nseen in the mucous membranes. There is also a slight inflammation of the\r\ngums, and a violet line around their edge. Ginpon observed this line\r\nafter two months’ treatment of a patient by silver nitrate; the whole\r\nquantity taken being 3·9 grms. (about 60 grains). The peculiar colour of\r\nthe skin is only seen after large dose; after 8 grms. taken in divided\r\ndoses Chaillon could not observe any change, but after 15 grms. had been\r\ntaken it was evident. So also Riemer has recorded a case, in which,\r\nafter a year’s use of silver nitrate (total quantity 17·4 grms.) a\r\ngreyish-black colour of the face was produced, and, when nearly double\r\nthe quantity had been taken, the colour had invaded the whole body.\r\n\r\n§ 826. =Post-mortem Appearances.=--In the acute case recorded by\r\nScattergood, the mucous membranes of the gullet, of the great curvature\r\nof the stomach, and parts of the duodenum and jejunum were eroded, and\r\nparticles of curd-like silver chloride adhered to the mucous membrane.\r\n\r\nIn the case recorded by Riemer of the long-continued use of silver\r\nnitrate, the serous and mucous membranes were coloured dark; the choroid\r\nplexus was of a blue-black; the endocardium, the valves of the heart,\r\nand the aorta pale to dark grey, as well as the rest of the vessels; the\r\ncolouring was confined to the intima. The liver and kidney also showed\r\nsimilar pigmentation. The pigment (probably metallic silver) was in the\r\nform of very fine grains, and, as regards the skin, was situate under\r\nthe _rete Malpighia_ in the upper layer of the corium, and also in the\r\ndeeper connective tissue and in the sweat glands. Liouville has also\r\nfound the kidneys of a woman similarly pigmented, who took silver\r\nnitrate daily for 270 days, in all about 7 grms., five years before her\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n§ 827. =Detection and Estimation of Silver.=--The examination of the\r\nsolid salts of silver usually met with (viz., the nitrate, bromide,\r\niodide, cyanide, and chloride) is most speedy by the dry method on\r\ncharcoal; in this way in less than 120 seconds any practical chemist\r\ncould identify each compound. The nitrate, bromide, iodide, and\r\ncyanide, all, if ignited on charcoal, yield buttons of metallic\r\nsilver--deflagration, bromine vapours, iodine vapours, and cyanogen\r\nvapours being the respective phenomena observed. Chloride of silver\r\nfuses to a pearl-grey, brown, or black globule on charcoal, according to\r\nits purity; but is only in the R.F. gradually reduced to metal. With\r\nsoda, or fused in hydrogen or coal gas, the reduction is rapid enough.\r\n\r\n=Nitrate of Silver in solution= might be identified by a very large\r\nnumber of tests, since it forms so many insoluble salts. In practice one\r\nis, however, satisfied with three tests, viz.: (1) A curdy precipitate\r\nof chloride, on the addition of hydrochloric acid or alkaline chlorides,\r\nsoluble only in ammonia, cyanide of potassium, or hyposulphite of soda;\r\n(2) a yellow precipitate, but little soluble in ammonia, on the addition\r\nof iodide of potassium; and (3) a blood-red precipitate on the addition\r\nof chromate of potash.\r\n\r\nThe separation of silver from the contents of the stomach is best\r\nensured by treating it with cyanide of potassium; for, unless a very\r\nlarge quantity of silver nitrate has been taken, it is tolerably certain\r\nthat the whole of it has passed into chloride, and will, therefore, not\r\nbe attacked easily by acids. The contents of the stomach, then, or the\r\ntissues themselves, are placed in a flask and warmed for some time with\r\ncyanide of potassium, first, if necessary, adding ammonia. The fluid is\r\nseparated from the solid matters by subsidence (for an alkaline fluid of\r\nthis kind will scarcely filter), and then decomposed by hydrochloric\r\nacid in excess. The flask containing this fluid is put on one side in a\r\nwarm place, and the clear fluid decanted from the insoluble chloride.\r\nThe latter is now collected on a filter, well washed with hot water, and\r\nthen dried and reduced on charcoal; or it may be put in a little\r\nporcelain crucible with a rod of zinc and a few drops of hydrochloric\r\nacid. The silver is soon deposited, and must be washed with water, then\r\nwith sulphuric acid. By the aid of a wash-bottle the particles of silver\r\nare now collected on a small filter, again washed, and on the moist mass\r\na crystal of nitrate of potash and a little carbonate of soda laid. The\r\nwhole is then dried, and all the filter cut away, save the small portion\r\ncontaining the silver. This small portion is now heated on charcoal\r\nuntil a little button of pure silver is obtained, which may first be\r\nweighed, then dissolved in nitric acid, and tested by the methods\r\ndetailed.\r\n\r\nIn a similar way hair, suspected of being dyed with silver, can be\r\ntreated with chlorine gas, and the chloride dissolved in potassic\r\ncyanide.\r\n\r\nSpots on linen, and, generally, very small quantities of silver, may be\r\ndetected by a simple galvanic process:--The substance is treated with\r\nsolution of cyanide of potassium, and submitted to a weak galvanic\r\ncurrent, using for the negative plate a slip of copper, for the\r\npositive, platinum; the silver is deposited on the former.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. MERCURY.\r\n\r\n§ 828. =Mercury=, Hg = 200; specific gravity, 13·596; boiling-point,\r\n350° (662° F.); it becomes solid at -39·4 (-39 F.). This well known and\r\nfamiliar fluid metal evaporates and sublimes to a minute extent at all\r\ntemperatures above 5°.\r\n\r\nWhen precipitated or deposited in a finely divided state, the metal can\r\nbe united into a single globule only if it is fairly pure; very slight\r\n_fatty_ impurities especially will prevent the union. It is insoluble in\r\nhydrochloric acid, soluble to a slight extent in dilute cold sulphuric\r\nacid, and completely soluble in concentrated sulphuric and in nitric\r\nacids. It combines directly with chlorine, bromine, and iodine, which,\r\nin presence of free alkali, readily dissolve it. It is unalterable at\r\n100°, and, when exposed to a high temperature, sublimes unchanged.\r\n\r\n=Mercurous Chloride= (Calomel, HgCl = 235·5; specific gravity, 7·178;\r\nsubliming temperature, 111·6°; Hg, 84·94 per cent., Cl, 15·06 per\r\ncent.), when prepared in the wet way is a heavy white powder, absolutely\r\ninsoluble in cold, but decomposed by boiling water. It may be converted\r\ninto the mercuric chloride by chlorine water and aqua regia. Chloride of\r\nammonium, potassium, and sodium, all decompose calomel into metallic\r\nmercury and mercuric chloride. It is easily reduced to metal in a tube\r\nwith soda, potash, or burnt magnesia.\r\n\r\n§ 829. =Sulphide of Mercury= (HgS, Hg, 86·21 per cent., S, 13·79 per\r\ncent.) is a black powder, dissolving in nitromuriatic acid, but very\r\ninsoluble in other acids or in water. It is also insoluble in alkaline\r\nsulphides, with the exception of potassic sulphide.\r\n\r\n§ 830. =Medicinal Preparations of Mercury.=--Mercury in the liquid state\r\nhas been occasionally administered in constipation; its internal use is\r\nnow (or ought to be) obsolete. Gmelin has found samples contaminated\r\nwith metallic bismuth--a metal which only slightly diminishes the\r\nfluidity of mercury; the impurity may be detected by shaking the mercury\r\nin air, and thus oxidising the bismuth. Mercury may also contain various\r\nmechanical impurities, which are detected by forcing the metal by means\r\nof a vacuum pump through any dense filtering substance. Tin and zinc may\r\nbe dissolved out by hydrochloric acid, and all fixed impurities (such as\r\nlead and bismuth) are at once discovered on subliming the metal.\r\n\r\n=Mercury and Chalk= (=Hydrargyrum cum creta=).--Mercury, 33·33 per\r\ncent.; chalk, 66·67.\r\n\r\n=Blue Pill= (=Pilula hydrargyri=).--Mercury in a finely divided state,\r\nmixed with confection of roses and liquorice root; the mercury should be\r\nin the proportion of 33·33 per cent.[902]\r\n\r\n[902] The chemical composition of blue pill varies according to its age.\r\nHarold Senier has made a careful series of analyses, with the following\r\nresult (_Pharm.

Hg.\r\n\r\n=Liniment of Mercury= (=Linimentum hydrargyri=) is made of mercurial\r\nointment, solution of ammonia, and liniment of camphor; it contains\r\nabout 16½ per cent. of mercury.\r\n\r\n=Mercurial Suppositories= (=Suppositoria hydrargyri=).--Composed of\r\nointment of mercury and oil of theobroma. Each suppository should weigh\r\n15 grains and contain ⅓ of its weight of mercurial ointment.\r\n\r\n=Acetate of Mercury= (=Mercurous acetate=) is not contained in the B.P.,\r\nbut is officinal on the Continent. It is a salt occurring in white\r\nmicaceous scales, soluble in 133 parts of cold water, giving the\r\nreactions of acetic acid and mercury, and very readily decomposed.\r\n\r\n=Mercuric Ethyl Chloride= (=Hydrargyrum æthylo-chloratum=) is used as a\r\nmedicine on the Continent. It occurs in white, glittering, crystalline\r\nscales, which take on pressure a metallic appearance, and possess a\r\npeculiar ethereal odour; it is but little soluble in water and ether,\r\nwith difficulty in cold alcohol, but copiously soluble on boiling, and\r\ndepositing crystals on cooling. It sublimes at about 40° without\r\nresidue; on quick heating it burns with a weak flame, developing a\r\nvapour of metallic taste and unpleasant odour. It gives no precipitate\r\nwith silver nitrate, nor with albumen.\r\n\r\n=Corrosive Sublimate= (=Mercuric chloride=), HgCl₂ = 271; Hg, 73·8 per\r\ncent., Cl, 26·1 per cent.--In commerce this salt occurs in transparent,\r\nheavy, colourless masses, which have a crystalline fracture; if placed\r\nin the subliming cell described at p. 258, it sublimes at about 82·2°\r\n(180° F.), and melts at higher temperatures. The sublimate is generally\r\nin groups of plates drawn to a point at both ends, in crystalline\r\nneedles, or in octahedra with a rectangular base. It dissolves in 16\r\nparts of cold water and about 3 of boiling, and is very soluble in\r\nsolutions of the alkaline chlorides; it dissolves also in ether, and can\r\nbe, to a great extent, withdrawn from aqueous solutions by this agent.\r\nAlcohol dissolves nearly one-third its weight of the salt, and its own\r\nweight when boiling. It combines with albumen; gives, when in solution,\r\na precipitate of mercuric oxide when tested with solution of potash; a\r\nwhite precipitate with ammonia; a scarlet with iodide of potassium; and\r\na black precipitate of finely divided mercury with protochloride of tin.\r\nIf a crystal (when placed in the subliming cell) gives a crystalline\r\nsublimate at about the temperature mentioned, and this sublimate becomes\r\nof a red colour when treated with a droplet of iodide of potassium, it\r\ncan be no other substance than corrosive sublimate.\r\n\r\n=Solution of Perchloride of Mercury= (=Liquor hydrargyri perchloridi=)\r\nis simply 10 grains of perchloride of mercury and chloride of ammonium\r\nin a pint of water; 100 c.c. therefore should contain 114 mgrms.\r\ncorrosive sublimate.\r\n\r\n=Yellow Mercurial Lotion= (=Lotio hydrargyri flava=).--Perchloride of\r\nmercury, 18 grains, mixed with 10 ounces of solution of lime.\r\n\r\n=Calomel=[903] (=Hydrargyri subchloridum=).--The properties of calomel\r\nhave been already described. It sometimes contains as an impurity\r\ncorrosive sublimate, which may be dissolved out by ether. Carbonate of\r\nlead, sulphate, and carbonate of baryta, gum, and starch, are the usual\r\nadulterants mentioned. If on the application of heat calomel entirely\r\nsublimes, it must be free from the substances enumerated.\r\n\r\n[903] It would appear that in America a cosmetic is in use, consisting\r\nof calomel mixed into a paste with water.--_Vide_ “A Dangerous\r\nCosmetic,” by C. H. Piesse, _Analyst_ (25), 1878, p. 241.\r\n\r\n=Oleate of Mercury= (=Hydrargyri oleatum=) is composed of 1 part of\r\nyellow oxide and 9 parts of oleic acid.\r\n\r\n=Black Mercurial Lotion= (=Lotio hydrargyri nigra=).--Calomel, 30\r\ngrains, mixed with 10 fluid ounces of lime-water.\r\n\r\n=Compound Pill of Subchloride of Mercury.=--Calomel and sulphurated\r\nantimony, each 1 ounce, guiac resin 2 ounces, castor-oil 1 fluid ounce.\r\nOne grain (·0648 grm.) of calomel, and the same quantity of antimony\r\nsulphide, are contained in every 5 grains (324 mgrms.) of the pill mass,\r\n_i.e._, calomel 20 per cent.\r\n\r\n=Ointment of Subchloride of Mercury= (=Unguentum hydrargyri\r\nsubchloridi=).--Calomel mixed with benzoated lard; strength about 1 :\r\n6½.\r\n\r\n=White Precipitate= (=Hydrargyrum ammoniatum=, NH₂HgCl).--A white, heavy\r\npowder, subliming by heat without residue, and insoluble in water,\r\nalcohol, and ether. With soda, it yields a metallic sublimate. When\r\nboiled with potash, ammonia is evolved, the yellow oxide of mercury\r\nformed, and chloride of potassium passes into solution. It should\r\ncontain 79·5 per cent. of mercury.\r\n\r\nThe fusible white precipitate of the pharmacopœia of the Netherlands\r\ndoes not appear to be of constant composition, varying between 69·4 to\r\n65·6 per cent. of mercury.[904] It melts on heating, and leaves as a\r\nresidue chloride of sodium.\r\n\r\n[904] Hirsch, _Die Prüfung der Arzeneimittel_.\r\n\r\nCommercial white precipitate is frequently adulterated; Barnes has found\r\ncarbonates of lead and lime, the latter to the extent of nearly 2 per\r\ncent.[905] Calomel, according to Nickles,[906] has been substituted for\r\nwhite precipitate, but this was several years ago. The methods for\r\ndetection are obvious.\r\n\r\n[905] _Proceed. Brit. Pharm. Conf._, 1867, p. 10.\r\n\r\n[906] _Journ. Pharm. et Chim._, le Série, 1858, vol. viij. p. 399.\r\n\r\n=Ointment of Ammoniated Mercury= (=Unguentum hydrargyri ammoniati=).--1\r\npart of ammoniated mercury mixed with 9 parts of simple ointment.\r\n\r\n=Red Iodide of Mercury= (=Hydrargyrum iodidum rubrum=, HgI₂).--A\r\ncrystalline powder of a scarlet colour, becoming yellow on gentle\r\nheating. It is very insoluble in water, one part requiring from 6000 to\r\n7000 parts; soluble in 130 parts of cold, 150 of hot alcohol; and\r\ndissolving freely in ether, or in aqueous solution of iodide of\r\npotassium.\r\n\r\n=Ointment of Red Iodide of Mercury= (=Unguentum hydrargyri iodidi\r\nrubri=).--16 grains of the substance mixed with an ounce of simple\r\nointment.\r\n\r\n=Green Iodide of Mercury= (=Hydrargyri iodidum viride=, HgI).--A dingy,\r\ngreenish-yellow powder, darkening on exposure to light, and easily\r\ndecomposed into the red iodide.\r\n\r\n=Red Oxide of Mercury= (=Hydrargyri oxidum rubrum=), HgO = 216; Hg,\r\n92·12 per cent.; specific gravity, 11 to 11·3; small, red, shining,\r\ncrystalline scales, very insoluble in water, requiring about 20,000\r\nparts; entirely soluble in hydrochloric acid. By a heat below redness it\r\nmay be volatilised, and at the same time decomposed into mercury and\r\noxygen. Its principal impurity is nitric acid, readily detected by the\r\nusual tests, or by heating in a test-tube, when, if nitric acid is\r\npresent, orange vapours will be evolved. Fixed red powders (such as\r\nbrick-dust and minium) are detected by being left as a residue, after\r\nthe application of heat sufficient to volatilise the mercury. An\r\nointment (strength 1 : 8) is officinal.\r\n\r\n=Sulphate of Mercury.=--A white crystalline powder, decomposed by water\r\ninto the very insoluble basic salt of mercury, known as _Turbith\r\nmineral_, HgSO₄2HgO.\r\n\r\n=Turbith, or Turpeth, Mineral= is contained in the French pharmacopœia,\r\nHgSO₄2HgO; Hg, 82·4 per cent.; specific gravity, 8·319. It requires for\r\nsolution 2000 parts of cold, and 600 of boiling water; but dissolves\r\nwith tolerable ease in hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\n=The Sulphide of Mercury=, known in commerce under the name of _Ethiops\r\nmineral_, is officinal in France, the Netherlands, and Germany. Its\r\nproperties have been already described. The German and Dutch\r\npharmacopœias require in it 50, the French only 33⅓ per cent. of\r\nmetallic mercury.\r\n\r\n=Hahnemann’s Soluble Mercury= (=Hydrargyrum solubile Hahnemanni=) is\r\nofficinal in the Dutch pharmacopœia. As found in commerce it contains\r\nmetallic mercury, nitric acid, and ammonia. The mercury should be in the\r\nproportion of 86·33 per cent., the ammonia 2·44 per cent.\r\n\r\n=Crystallised Nitrate of Mercury= (=Hydrargyrum nitricum oxidulatum=) is\r\nofficinal in the pharmacopœias of Germany, Switzerland, and France. The\r\nsalt is in white crystals, giving the reactions of nitric acid and\r\nmercury, decomposed by the addition of water, but fully soluble in\r\nwater, if first moistened with nitric acid. The formula of the neutral\r\nsalt is Hg2NO₃HgO2H₂O, which requires 69·4 per cent. of mercury. An acid\r\nsolution of mercuric nitrate is officinal.\r\n\r\n=An Ointment of Nitrate of Mercury= (=Unguentum hydrargyri nitratis=)\r\n(often called citrine ointment) is contained in the B.P.; it is made\r\nwith 4 parts of mercury, nitric acid 12, lard 15, olive oil, 32; the\r\nstrength is about 1 in 15½.\r\n\r\n=A Chloride of Mercury and Quinine= exists in commerce, prepared by\r\nmixing 1 part of corrosive sublimate in solution with 3 parts of quinine\r\nchloride, evaporating, and crystallising.\r\n\r\n=Cyanide of Mercury=, HgCy, is contained in the French pharmacopœia. It\r\noccurs in small, colourless, prismatic crystals, easily soluble in\r\nwater. If to the solution chloride of tin be added, a black precipitate\r\nof reduced metal and stannous oxide is thrown down, and the odour of\r\nprussic acid is developed.\r\n\r\n=Mercuric Sulphide= (=Sulphide of Mercury=, =Cinnabar=, =Vermilion=) is\r\nofficinal in Germany, the Netherlands, and France; HgS = 232; specific\r\ngravity, solid, 8·2; Hg, 86·21 per cent., O, 13·79 per cent. For\r\nmedicinal purposes it is made artificially. It is a beautiful red\r\npowder, insoluble in all alkaline and all acid liquids, with the\r\nexception of aqua regia. The solution gives the reactions of a sulphide\r\nand mercury. On heating, it must burn away entirely without residue;\r\nadulterations or impurities are--minium, lead, copper, and other metals.\r\nThe detection of minium is conveniently executed in the dry way. Pure\r\ncinnabar, when heated in a matrass, gives a black sublimate, which\r\nbecomes red on friction. If minium is present, sulphide of lead remains\r\nas a residue, and may be recognised on coal; the same remark applies to\r\nsulphide of antimony. If it be desired to take the percentage of mercury\r\nin cinnabar, equal parts of oxalate and cyanide of potassium should be\r\nwell mixed with the cinnabar, and heated in the bent tube described at\r\np. 654; by this means the whole of the metallic mercury is readily\r\nobtained.[907]\r\n\r\n[907] Dr. Sutro has published a case (quoted by Taylor), in which the\r\nvapour of vermilion, applied externally, produced poisonous symptoms;\r\nyet, according to Polak, the Persians inhale it medicinally, smoking it\r\nwith tobacco, catechu, mucilage, &c., the only bad effect being an\r\noccasional stomatitis.--Eulenberg, _Gewerbe Hygiene_, p. 741.\r\n\r\n§ 831. =Mercury in the Arts.=--The use of mercury in the arts is so\r\nextensive, that any one in analytical practice is almost certain\r\noccasionally to meet with cases of accidental poisoning, either from the\r\nvapour[908] or some of its combinations.\r\n\r\n[908] A singular case is cited by Tardieu (_Étude méd.-légal sur\r\nl’Empoisonnement_), in which a man, supposing he had some minerals\r\ncontaining gold, attempted the extraction by amalgamation with mercury.\r\nHe used a portable furnace (for the purpose of volatilising the mercury)\r\nin a small room, and his wife, who assisted him, suffered from a very\r\nwell-marked stomatitis and mercurial eruption.\r\n\r\nQuicksilver is used in the extraction of gold, the silvering of mirrors,\r\nthe construction of barometers, and various scientific instruments and\r\nappliances; also for the preservation of insects, and occasionally for\r\ntheir destruction.[909] An alloy with zinc and cadmium is employed by\r\ndentists for stopping teeth; but there is no evidence that it has been\r\nat all injurious, the mercury, probably, being in too powerful a state\r\nof combination to be attacked by the fluids in the mouth.[910] Cinnabar\r\nhas also been employed to give a red colour to confections, and it may\r\nbe found in tapers, cigarette papers, and other coloured articles. The\r\nnitrate of mercury in solution finds application in the colouring of\r\nhorn, in the etching of metals, in the colouring of the finer sorts of\r\nwool, and in the hat manufacture.\r\n\r\n[909] Forty-three persons were salivated from fumigating rooms with\r\nmercury for the purpose of destroying bugs (Sonnenschein’s _Handbuch_,\r\np. 96).\r\n\r\n[910] More danger is to be apprehended from the vulcanised rubber for\r\nartificial teeth; and, according to Dr. Taylor, accidents have occurred\r\nfrom the use of such supports or plates.\r\n\r\nThe sulphocyanide of mercury gives, when burnt, a most abundant ash, a\r\nfact utilised in the toy known as Pharaoh’s serpent; the products of\r\ncombustion are mercurial vapours and sulphurous anhydride. That the\r\nsubstance itself is poisonous, is evident from the following\r\nexperiment:--·5 grm. was given to a pigeon without immediate result; but\r\nten hours afterwards it was indisposed, refused its food, and in forty\r\nhours died without convulsions.[911]\r\n\r\n[911] Eulenberg, _Op. cit._, p. 472.\r\n\r\n§ 832. The more Common Patent and Quack Medicines containing Mercury.\r\n\r\n    =Mordant’s Norton’s Drops.=--This patent medicine is a mixture of\r\n    the tincture of gentian and ginger, holding in solution a little\r\n    bichloride of mercury, and coloured with cochineal.\r\n\r\n    =Solomon’s Anti-impetigines= is a solution of bichloride of mercury,\r\n    flavoured and coloured.\r\n\r\n    =Poor Man’s Friend.=--An ointment of nitrate of mercury.\r\n\r\n    =Brown’s Lozenges.=--Each lozenge contains ½ grain of calomel, and\r\n    3½ grains of resinous extract of jalap; the rest is white sugar and\r\n    tragacanth.\r\n\r\n    =Ching’s Worm Lozenges.=--Each lozenge contains 1 grain of calomel;\r\n    the rest white sugar and tragacanth, with saffron as a colouring\r\n    matter.\r\n\r\n    =Storey’s Worm Cakes.=--Each cake 2 grains of calomel, 2 grains of\r\n    cinnabar, 6 grains of jalap, 5 grains of ginger, and the remainder\r\n    sugar and water.\r\n\r\n    =Wright’s Pearl Ointment= is said to be made up of 8 ozs. of white\r\n    precipitate rubbed to a cream in 1 pint of Goulard’s extract, and to\r\n    the mixture is added 7 lbs. of white wax and 10 lbs. of olive oil.\r\n\r\n    =Keyser’s Pills.=--The receipt for these pills is--red oxide of\r\n    mercury 1½ oz., distilled vinegar (dilute acetic acid) 1 pint;\r\n    dissolve, add to the resulting solution manna 2 lbs., and triturate\r\n    for a long time before the fire, until a proper consistence is\r\n    attained; lastly, divide the mass into pills of 1½ grain each.\r\n\r\n    =Mitchell’s Pills.=--Each pill contains aloes ·8 grain, rhubarb 1·6\r\n    grain, calomel ·16 grain, tartar emetic ·05 grain.\r\n\r\n    Many =Antibilious Pills= will be found to contain calomel, a few\r\n    mercury in a finely divided state.\r\n\r\n§ 833. =Mercury in Veterinary Medicine.=--Farmers and farriers use the\r\nointment (_blue ointment_) to a dangerous extent, as a dressing for the\r\nfly, and wholesale poisoning of sheep has been in several instances the\r\nconsequence.[912] Ethiops mineral and Turpeth mineral are given to dogs\r\nwhen affected by the distemper, worms, or the mange. Mercury, however,\r\nis not very frequently given to cattle by veterinary surgeons, ruminants\r\ngenerally appearing rather susceptible to its poisonous effects.\r\n\r\n[912] Twenty-five tons of blue ointment are said to have been sold to\r\nfarmers by a druggist in Boston, Lincolnshire, in the course of a single\r\nyear.--Taylor’s _Medical Jurisprudence_, vol. i. p. 279.\r\n\r\n§ 834. =Medicinal and Fatal Dose--Horses.=--Cinnabar 14·2 grms, (½ oz.),\r\ncalomel 14·2 grms. (½ oz.) or more, corrosive sublimate ·13 to ·38 grm.\r\n(2 to 6 grains), and as much as 1·3 grm. (20 grains) have been given in\r\nfarcy.\r\n\r\n=Cattle.=--Mercury with chalk 3·8 to 11·6 grms. (1 to 3 drms.), calomel\r\n3·8 to 7·7 grms. (1 to 2 drms.) for worms; ·65 to 1·3 grm. (10 to 20\r\ngrains) as an alterative; Ethiops mineral, 7·7 to 15·5 grms. (2 to 4\r\ndrms.).\r\n\r\n=Dogs.=--Ethiops or Turpeth mineral ·13 to 1·3 grm. (2 to 20 grains),\r\naccording to the size.\r\n\r\n=Fowls.=--Mercury and chalk are given in fractions of a grain.\r\n\r\n=Hogs= are also treated with mercury and chalk; the dose usually given\r\ndoes not exceed ·32 grm. (5 grains).\r\n\r\nIt may be remarked that many of the doses quoted appear very large; the\r\nwriter cannot but consider that 20 grains of corrosive sublimate\r\nadministered to a horse would be more likely to kill the animal than to\r\ncure the disease.\r\n\r\n=Man.=--Corrosive sublimate has been fatal in a dose so small as ·19\r\ngrm. (3 grains); white precipitate has caused dangerous symptoms in\r\ndoses of from 1·9 to 2·6 grm. (30 to 40 grains); the cyanide of mercury\r\nhas killed a person in a dose of ·64 grm. (10 grains)--_Christison_; and\r\nTurpeth mineral has proved fatal in doses of 2·6 grms. (40 grains).\r\n\r\nOther preparations of mercury have also been fatal, but a doubt has\r\nexisted as to the precise quantity. Sometimes, also, there is probably a\r\nchemical change in the substance, so that it is impossible to state the\r\nfatal dose. For example, it is well known that calomel, under the\r\ninfluence of alkaline chlorides, can be converted into the bichloride--a\r\nfact which probably explains the extensive corrosive lesions that have\r\nbeen found after death from large doses of calomel.\r\n\r\n§ 835. =Poisoning by Mercury--Statistics.=--In the Registrar-General’s\r\ndeath returns for the ten years ending 1892, it appears that in England\r\nthe deaths from mercurial poisoning[913] were 40 males, 19 females; of\r\nthese, 16 males and 18 females were cases of suicide, the remainder were\r\nreferred to accident.\r\n\r\n[913] The deaths are registered under the term “_Mercury_,” but the\r\nmajority are poisonings by “_Corrosive Sublimate_.”\r\n\r\nThe effects of the different compounds of mercury may be divided into\r\ntwo groups, viz., (1) Those caused by the finely divided metal and the\r\nnon-corrosive compounds; (2) the effects caused by the corrosive\r\ncompounds.\r\n\r\n§ 836. (1) Effects of Mercurial Vapour, and of the Non-Corrosive\r\nCompounds of Mercury.\r\n\r\n(_a_) =Vegetable Life.=--Priestly and Boussingault have shown that\r\nplants under a glass shade in which mercury is exposed in a saucer,\r\nfirst exhibit black spots on the leaves; ultimately, the latter blacken\r\nentirely, and the plants die.\r\n\r\n(_b_) =Animal Life.=--Mercury in the form of vapour is fatal to animal\r\nlife, but it is only so by repeated and intense application.\r\nEulenberg[914] placed a rabbit under a large glass shade, and for four\r\ndays exposed it daily for two hours to the volatilisation of 2 grms. of\r\nmercury on warm sand; on the sixth and seventh day 1·5 grm. was\r\nvolatilised. On the fifteenth day there was no apparent change in the\r\naspect of the animal; 5 grms. of mercury were then heated in a retort,\r\nand the vapour blown in at intervals of ten minutes. Fourteen days\r\nafterwards the gums were reddened and swollen, and the appetite lost;\r\nthe conjunctivæ were also somewhat inflamed. The following day these\r\nsymptoms disappeared, and the animal remained well.\r\n\r\n[914] _Op. cit._, p. 728.\r\n\r\nIn another experiment 20 grms. of mercury were volatilised, and a rabbit\r\nexposed to the vapour under a small glass shade. The following day the\r\nconjunctivæ were moist and reddened; two days afterwards 10 grms. of\r\nmercury were volatilised in the same way; and in two days’ interval\r\nother 10 grms. were volatilised in three-quarters of an hour. There was\r\nno striking change noticeable in the condition of the animal, but\r\nwithin forty-eight hours it was found dead. The cause of death proved to\r\nbe an extravasation of blood at the base of the brain. The bronchia were\r\nreddened throughout, and the lungs congested. Mercury, as with man, is\r\nalso readily absorbed by the broken or unbroken skin; hence thousands of\r\nsheep have been poisoned by the excessive and ignorant external\r\napplication of mercurial ointment as a remedy against the attacks of\r\nparasites. The sheep become emaciated, refuse food, and seem to be in\r\npain, breathing with short quick gasps.\r\n\r\nIn experiments on rabbits, dogs, and warm-blooded animals generally,\r\nsalivation and stomatitis are found to occur as regularly as in man; so\r\nalso in animals and man, paralytic and other nervous affections have\r\nbeen recorded.\r\n\r\n§ 837. (_c_) =Effects on Man.=--In 1810[915] an extraordinary accident\r\nproduced, perhaps, the largest wholesale poisoning by mercurial vapour\r\non record. The account of this is as follows:--H.M.S. “Triumph,” of\r\nseventy-four guns, arrived in the harbour of Cadiz in the month of\r\nFebruary 1810; and in the following March, a Spanish vessel, laden with\r\nmercury for the South American mines, having been driven on shore in a\r\ngale, was wrecked. The “Triumph” saved by her boats 130 tons of the\r\nmercury, and this was stowed on board. The mercury was first confined in\r\nbladders, the bladders again were enclosed in small barrels, and the\r\nbarrels in boxes. The heat of the weather, however, was at this time\r\nconsiderable; and the bladders, having been wetted in the removal from\r\nthe wreck, soon rotted, and mercury, to the amount of several tons, was\r\nspeedily diffused as vapour through the ship, mixing more or less with\r\nthe bread and the other provisions. In three weeks 200 men were affected\r\nwith ptyalism, ulceration of the mouth, partial paralysis, and, in many\r\ninstances, with diarrhœa. The “Triumph” was now ordered to Gibraltar,\r\nthe provisions were removed, and efforts were made to cleanse the\r\nvessel. On restowing the hold, every man so employed was salivated. The\r\neffects noted were not confined to the officers and ship’s company, for\r\nalmost all the stock died from the fumes--mice, cats, a dog, and even a\r\ncanary bird shared the same fate, though the food of the latter was kept\r\nin a bottle closely corked up. The vapour was very deleterious to those\r\nhaving any tendency to pulmonic affections. Three men, who had never\r\ncomplained before they were saturated with mercury, died of phthisis;\r\none, who had not had any pulmonic complaint, was left behind at\r\nGibraltar, where his illness developed into a confirmed phthisis. Two\r\ndied from gangrene of the cheeks and tongue. A woman, confined to bed\r\nwith a fractured limb, lost two of her teeth; and many exfoliations of\r\nthe jaw took place.\r\n\r\n[915] “An Account of the Effect of Mercurial Vapours on the Crew of His\r\nMajesty’s Ship ‘Triumph,’ in the year 1810.”--_Phil. Trans._, 113,\r\n1823.\r\n\r\nAccidents from the vapour of mercury, quite independently of its\r\napplications in the arts, have also occurred, some of them under curious\r\ncircumstances; such, for example, is the case mentioned in the footnote\r\nto p. 639. Witness, again, a case mentioned by Seidel,[916] in which a\r\nfemale, on the advice of an old woman, inhaled for some affection or\r\nother 2·5 grms. of mercury poured on red-hot coals, and died in ten days\r\nwith all the symptoms of mercurial poisoning.\r\n\r\n[916] Maschka’s _Handbuch_, Bd. ii. 295.\r\n\r\nThe metal taken in bulk into the stomach has been considered\r\nnon-poisonous, and, probably, when perfectly pure, it is so; we have,\r\nhowever, the case of a girl who swallowed 4½ ozs. by weight of the\r\nliquid metal, for the purpose of procuring abortion--this it did not\r\neffect; but, in a few days, she suffered from a trembling and shaking of\r\nthe body and loss of muscular power. These symptoms continued for two\r\nmonths, but there was no salivation and no blue marks on the gums. This\r\ncase is a rare one, and a pound or more has been taken without injury.\r\n\r\n§ 838. =Absorption of Mercury by the Skin.=--Mercury in a finely divided\r\nform, rubbed into the skin, is absorbed, and all the effects of\r\nmercurialism result. This method of administering mercury for medicinal\r\npurposes has long been in use, but, when the inunction is excessive,\r\ndeath may occur. Thus, Leiblinger records a case in which three persons\r\nwere found dead in bed; the day before they had rubbed into the body,\r\nfor the purpose of curing the itch, a salve containing 270 grms. of\r\nmercury finely divided.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to say in what proportion workers in mercury, such as\r\nwater-gilders, &c., suffer. According to Hirt, not only do 1·5 to 2·1\r\nper cent. of the workmen employed in smelting mercury ores suffer\r\nacutely, but as high a proportion as 8·7 per cent. are slightly\r\naffected.\r\n\r\n§ 839. =Symptoms of Poisoning by Mercury Vapour.=--The symptoms of\r\npoisoning by mercury vapour, or by the finely divided metal, are the\r\nsame as those which arise from the corrosive salts, with the exception\r\nof the local action. In mild cases there is pallor, languor, and sore\r\nmouth (from slightly inflamed gums), fœtid breath, and disorder of the\r\ndigestive organs. If the action is more intense, there is an\r\ninflammation of the gums and, indeed, of the whole mouth, and\r\nsalivation, which is sometimes so profuse that as much as two gallons of\r\nsaliva have been secreted daily. The saliva is alkaline, has a bad\r\nodour, and its specific gravity in the early stages is increased, but\r\nultimately becomes normal; the gums are raised into slight swellings,\r\nwhich gradually enlarge and coalesce. The teeth that are already\r\ncarious, decay more rapidly; they become loose, and some may be shed;\r\nthe inflammatory action may extend to the jaw, and necrosis of portions\r\nof the bone is no unusual occurrence. On recovery, the cheeks sometimes\r\nform adhesions with the gums, and cicatrices always mark the loss of\r\nsubstance which such an affection entails. With the stomatitis there are\r\ndisturbances of the gastro-intestinal tract--nausea and vomiting, pain\r\nin the stomach, and diarrhœa alternating with constipation.\r\nConjunctivitis is very common, both in man and animals, from exposure to\r\nmercury vapours. The further action of the metal is shown in its\r\nprofound effects on the nervous system. The patient is changed in his\r\ndisposition, he is excitable, nervous, or torpid; there are\r\nsleeplessness and bad dreams, at the same time headache, noises in the\r\nears, giddiness, faintings, &c.\r\n\r\n§ 840. =Mercurial Tremor.=--Mercurial tremor[917] may follow, or\r\naccompany the above state, or it may be the chief and most prominent\r\neffect. It specially affects the arms, partly withdrawing the muscles\r\nfrom the control of the will, so that a person affected with mercurial\r\ntremor is incapacitated for following any occupation, especially those\r\nrequiring a delicate and steady touch. In cases seriously affected, the\r\ntremor spreads gradually to the feet and legs, and finally the whole\r\nbody may be invaded. The patient is no longer master of his muscles--the\r\nmuscular system is in anarchy, each muscle aimlessly contracting and\r\nrelaxing independently of the rest--the movement of the legs becomes\r\nuncertain, the speech stuttering, the facial expressions are even\r\ndistorted into grimaces, and the sufferer sinks into a piteous state of\r\nhelplessness. The convulsive movements generally cease during sleep. The\r\ntremors are accompanied by interference with the functions of other\r\norgans: the respiration is weakened and difficult; dyspnœa, or an\r\nasthmatic condition, results; the pulse is small and slow; paresis,\r\ndeepening into paralysis of the extremities, or of a group of muscles,\r\nfollows; and, lastly, if the condition is not alleviated, the patient\r\nbecomes much emaciated and sinks from exhaustion. Pregnant women are\r\nliable to abortion, and the living infants of women suffering from\r\ntremor have also exhibited tremor of the limbs.\r\n\r\n[917] A case of mercurial tremor (in _Bericht. des K. K. Allgem.\r\nKrankenhauses zu Wien im Jahre 1872_, Wien, 1873) is interesting, as\r\nshowing the influence of pregnancy. A woman, twenty years of age,\r\nemployed in making barometers, had, in 1869, mercurial tremor and\r\nsalivation. During a three months’ pregnancy the tremor ceased, but\r\nagain appeared after she had aborted. She again became pregnant, and the\r\ntremor ceased until after her confinement in November 1871. The tremor\r\nwas so violent that the patient could not walk; she also had stomatitis;\r\nbut ultimately, by treatment with galvanism and other remedies, she\r\nrecovered.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the “mass poisoning” on board the “Triumph,” it has been\r\nmentioned that several of the sailors became consumptive, and the same\r\neffect has been noticed among all workers in the metal; it is now,\r\nindeed, an accepted fact that the cachexia induced by mercurialismus\r\nproduces a weak habit of body specially liable to the tuberculous\r\ninfection.\r\n\r\nThe course of the poisoning is generally more rapid when it has\r\nresulted from the taking of mercury internally as a medicine than when\r\ninhaled by workers in the metal, _e.g._, a patient suffering from\r\nmercurial tremor shown to the Medical Society by Mr. Spencer Watson in\r\n1872, had resisted for seven years the influence of the fumes of\r\nmercury; and then succumbed, exhibiting the usual symptoms. Idiosyncrasy\r\nplays a considerable _rôle_; some persons (and especially those whose\r\nkidneys are diseased) bear small doses of mercury ill, and are readily\r\nsalivated or affected; this is evidently due to imperfect elimination.\r\n\r\n§ 841. =Mercuric Methide=, Hg(CH₃)₂.--This compound is obtained by the\r\naction of methyl iodide on sodium amalgam in the presence of acetic\r\nether. It is a dense, stable liquid, of highly poisonous properties. In\r\n1865, mercuric methide, in course of preparation in a London laboratory,\r\ncaused two cases of very serious slow poisoning.[918] One was that of a\r\nGerman, aged 30, who was engaged in preparing this compound for three\r\nmonths, and during this time his sight and hearing became impaired; he\r\nwas very weak, his gums were sore, and he was ultimately admitted into\r\nSt. Bartholomew’s Hospital, February 3rd, 1865. His urine was found to\r\nbe albuminous, and his mental faculties very torpid. On the 9th he\r\nbecame noisy, and had to be put under mechanical restraint. On the 10th\r\nhe was semi-comatose, but there was no paralysis; his breath was very\r\noffensive, his pupils dilated; at intervals he raised himself and\r\nuttered incoherent howls. There was neither sensation nor motion in the\r\nleft leg, which was extended rigidly; the knee and the foot were turned\r\nslightly inward. On the 14th he died insensible.\r\n\r\n[918] _St. Barth. Hosp. Reports_, vol. i., 1866, p. 141.\r\n\r\nThe only appearance of note seen at the autopsy was a congestion of the\r\ngrey matter in the brain; the kidneys and liver were also congested, and\r\nthere were ecchymoses in the kidneys.\r\n\r\nThe second case--a young man, aged 23, working in the same\r\nlaboratory--was admitted into the hospital, March 28th, 1865. In the\r\nprevious January he had been exposed to the vapour of mercuric methide\r\nfor about a fortnight; during the illness of the other assistant he felt\r\nill and weak, and complained of soreness of the gums and looseness of\r\nthe teeth. He had also dimness of vision, pain and redness of the eyes,\r\ngiddiness, nausea and vomiting, the ejected matters being greenish and\r\nwatery. At the beginning of March his sight and taste became\r\nimperfect--all things tasted alike; his tongue was numb and his gums\r\nsore, he was also salivated slightly. A week before admission he lost\r\nhis hearing, and first his hands and then his feet became numb; on\r\nadmission his breath was very offensive, his pupils dilated; the sight\r\nimpaired; he was very deaf, and his powers of speech, taste, and smell\r\nwere deficient. There was anæsthesia of the body, and the movement of\r\nthe limbs was sluggish and difficult. He continued in the hospital for\r\nnearly a month, with but little change. On April 24th, it was noticed\r\nthat he was getting thinner and slightly jaundiced; he moved his arms\r\naimlessly in an idiotic manner, and passed his urine involuntarily. On\r\nApril 27th he was more restless, and even violent, shrieking out and\r\nmaking a loud, incoherent noise, or laughing foolishly; he passed his\r\nmotions and urine beneath him. On July 7th he was in a similar\r\nstate--perfectly idiotic. He died on April 7th, 1866, about a year and\r\nthree months from his first exposure to the vapour; the immediate cause\r\nof death was pneumonia. The _post-mortem_ appearances of the brain and\r\nmembranes differed little from the normal state; the grey matter was\r\npink, but otherwise healthy; there was a considerable amount of\r\ncerebro-spinal fluid; the arachnoid along the longitudinal fissure was\r\nthickened; the total weight of the brain with medulla was 41 ozs. The\r\nstomach was of enormous size; the pyramids of the kidneys were\r\ncongested, as was also the small intestine; the lungs showed the usual\r\nsigns of pneumonia.[919]\r\n\r\n[919] _St. Barth. Hosp. Reports_, vol. ii. p. 211.\r\n\r\n§ 842. =Effects of the Corrosive Salts of Mercury.=--The type of the\r\ncorrosive salts is mercuric chloride, or corrosive sublimate--a compound\r\nwhich acts violently when administered, either externally or internally,\r\nin large doses.[920] If the poison has been swallowed, the symptoms come\r\non almost immediately, and always within the first half hour; the whole\r\nduration also is rapid. In 36 cases collected by F. A. Falck, 11 died on\r\nthe first or second day, and 11 on the fifth day; so that 61 per cent.\r\ndied in five days--the remainder lived from six to twenty-six days. The\r\nshortest fatal case on record is one communicated to Dr. Taylor by Mr.\r\nWelch; in this instance the man died from an unknown quantity within\r\nhalf an hour.\r\n\r\n[920] The effects on animals are similar to those on man. Richard Mead\r\ngave a dog with bread 3·8 grms. (60 grains) of corrosive\r\nsublimate:--“Within a quarter of an hour he fell into terrible\r\nconvulsions, casting up frequently a viscid frothy mucus, every time\r\nmore and more bloody, till, tired and spent with this hard service, he\r\nlay down quietly, as it were, to sleep, but died the next morning.”\r\n\r\nIn the very act of swallowing, a strong metallic taste and a painful\r\nsensation of constriction in the throat are experienced. There is a\r\nburning heat in the throat extending downwards to the stomach. All the\r\nmucous membranes with which the solution comes in contact are attacked,\r\nshrivelled, and whitened; so that, on looking into the mouth, the\r\nappearance has been described as similar to that produced by the recent\r\napplication of silver nitrate. The local changes may be so intense as to\r\ncause œdema of the glottis, and death through asphyxia. In a few minutes\r\nviolent pain is felt in the stomach; so much so, that the sufferer is\r\ndrawn together, and is in a fainting condition; but there are rare cases\r\nin which pain has been absent. There are nausea and vomiting, the\r\nejected matters being often streaked with blood; after the vomiting\r\nthere is purging; here also the motions are frequently bloody.[921] The\r\ntemperature of the body sinks, the respiration is difficult, and the\r\npulse small, frequent, and irregular. The urine is generally scanty, and\r\nsometimes completely suppressed.[922] Sometimes there is profuse\r\nhæmorrhage from the bowel, stomach, or other mucous membrane, and such\r\ncases are accompanied by a considerable diminution of temperature. In a\r\ncase recorded by Lœwy,[923] after a loss of blood by vomiting and\r\ndiarrhœa, the temperature sank to 33·4°. The patient dies in a state of\r\ncollapse, or insensibility, and death is often preceded by convulsions.\r\n\r\n[921] The mixture of blood with the evacuations is more constantly\r\nobserved in poisoning by corrosive sublimate than in poisoning by\r\narsenic, copper, or lead.\r\n\r\n[922] In a case recorded by Dr. Wegeler (Casper’s _Wochenschrift_,\r\nJanuary 10, 1846, p. 30), a youth, aged 17, swallowed 11·6 grms. (3\r\ndrachms) of the poison. No pain was experienced on pressure of the\r\nabdomen; he died on the sixth day, and during the last three days of\r\nlife no urine was secreted.\r\n\r\n[923] _Vierteljahrsschr. für ger. Med._, 1864, vol. i. p. 187.\r\n\r\n§ 843. Two remarkable cases of death from the external use of corrosive\r\nsublimate are recorded by Anderseck. An ointment, containing corrosive\r\nsublimate, was rubbed into the skin of two girls, servants, in order to\r\ncure the itch. The one, during the inunction, complained of a burning of\r\nthe skin; the other also, a little while after, suffered in the same\r\nway. During the night the skin of each swelled, reddened, and became\r\nacutely painful. There were thirst and vomiting, but no diarrhœa, On the\r\nfollowing day there was an eruption of blebs or little blisters. On the\r\nthird day they had diarrhœa, tenesmus, fever, and diminution of the\r\nrenal secretion; on the fourth day, fœtid breath, stomatitis,\r\nhyperæsthesia of the body, and a feeling of “pins and needles” in the\r\nhands and feet were noted. The first girl died in the middle of the\r\nfifth day, fully conscious; the other died on the sixth. So also\r\nTaylor[924] gives the case of a girl, aged 9, who died from the effects\r\nof an alcoholic solution of corrosive sublimate (strength, 80 grains to\r\nthe oz.) applied to the scalp as a remedy for ringworm. The same\r\nauthor[925] further quotes the case of two brothers who died--the one on\r\nthe fifth, the other on the eleventh day--from the effects of absorbing\r\ncorrosive sublimate through the unbroken skin.\r\n\r\n[924] _Op. cit._\r\n\r\n[925] _Poisons_, 1848, p. 394.\r\n\r\n§ 844. =The Nitrates of Mercury= are poisons, but little (if at all)\r\ninferior in corrosive action to mercuric chloride. Death has resulted\r\nfrom both the external and internal use. Application of the nitrate as\r\nan escharotic to the _os uteri_, in one case,[926] produced all the\r\nsymptoms of mercurial poisoning, but the woman recovered; in another\r\ncase,[927] its use as a liniment caused death.\r\n\r\n[926] _Med. Gazette_, vol. 45, p. 1025.\r\n\r\n[927] _Edin. Monthly Journal_, 1864, p. 167.\r\n\r\n§ 845. When taken internally, the symptoms are scarcely different from\r\nthose produced by corrosive sublimate. It seems an unlikely vehicle for\r\ncriminal poisoning, yet, in the case of _Reg._ v. _E. Smith_ (Leicester\r\nSummer Assizes, 1857), a girl was proved to have put a solution of\r\nnitrate of mercury in some chamomile tea, which had been prescribed for\r\nthe prosecutrix. The nauseous taste prevented a fatal dose being taken;\r\nbut the symptoms were serious.\r\n\r\n§ 846. =Mercuric Cyanide= acts in a manner very similar to that of\r\ncorrosive sublimate, 1·3 grm. (about 20 grains) in one case,[928] and in\r\nanother[929] half the quantity, having destroyed life.\r\n\r\n[928] Orfila, i. p. 735.\r\n\r\n[929] Christison, p. 427.\r\n\r\n§ 847. =White Precipitate= (ammoniated mercury), as a poison, is weak.\r\nOut of fourteen cases collected by Taylor, two only proved fatal; one of\r\nthese formed the subject of a trial for murder, _Reg._ v. _Moore_ (Lewes\r\nLent Assizes, 1860). The effects produced are vomiting, purging, &c., as\r\nin corrosive sublimate.[930] Other preparations of mercury, such as the\r\nred iodide, the persulphide, and even calomel,[931] have all a more or\r\nless intense poisonous action, and have caused serious symptoms and\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n[930] See Dr. Th. Stevenson, “Poisoning by White Precipitate,” _Guy’s\r\nHospital Reports_, vol. xix. p. 415.\r\n\r\n[931] Seidel quotes a case from Hasselt, in which a father, for the\r\npurpose of obtaining insurance money, killed his child by calomel.\r\n\r\n§ 848. =Treatment of Acute and Chronic Poisoning.=--In acute poisoning,\r\nvomiting usually throws off some of the poison, if it has been\r\nswallowed; and the best treatment seems to be, to give copious\r\nalbuminous drinks, such, for example, as the whites of eggs in water,\r\nmilk, and the like. The vomiting may be encouraged by subcutaneous\r\ninjections of apomorphine. The after-treatment should be directed to\r\neliminating the poison, which is most safely effected by very copious\r\ndrinks of distilled water (see “Appendix”).\r\n\r\nThe treatment of slow poisoning is mainly symptomatic; medicinal doses\r\nof zinc phosphide seem to have done good in mercurial tremors. Potassic\r\niodide is also supposed to assist the elimination of mercury.\r\n\r\n§ 849. =Post-mortem Appearances.=--The pathological effects seen after\r\nchronic poisoning are too various to be distinctive. In the museum of\r\nthe Royal College of Surgeons there is (No. 2559) the portion of a colon\r\nderived from a lady aged 74.[932] This lady had been accustomed for\r\nforty-three years to take a grain of calomel every night; for many years\r\nshe did not suffer in health, but ultimately she became emaciated and\r\ncachectic, with anasarca and albuminuria. The kidneys were found to be\r\ngranular, and the mucous membrane of a great part of the intestine of a\r\nremarkable black colour, mottled with patches of a lighter hue,\r\npresenting somewhat the appearance of a toad’s back. From the portion of\r\ncolon preserved mercury was readily obtained by means of Reinsch’s\r\ntest. The black deposit is in the submucosa, and it is, without doubt,\r\nmercurial, and probably mercury sulphide. In acute poisoning (especially\r\nby the corrosive salts) the changes are great and striking. After rapid\r\ndeath from corrosive sublimate, the escharotic whitening of the mouth,\r\nthroat, and gullet, already described, will be seen. The mucous membrane\r\nright throughout, from mouth to anus, is more or less affected and\r\ndestroyed, according to the dose and concentration of the poison. The\r\nusual appearances in the stomach are those of intense congestion, with\r\necchymoses, and portions of it may be destroyed. Sometimes the coats are\r\nvery much blackened; this is probably due to a coating of sulphide of\r\nmercury.\r\n\r\n[932] _Path. Soc. Trans._, xviii. 111.\r\n\r\n    In St. George’s Hospital Museum (Ser. ix. 43, y. 337) there is a\r\n    stomach, rather large, with thickened mucous coats, and having on\r\n    the mucous surface a series of parallel black, or black-brown lines\r\n    of deposit; it was derived from a patient who died from taking\r\n    corrosive sublimate. With the severe changes mentioned, perforation\r\n    is rare.[933] In the intestines there are found hyperæmia,\r\n    extravasations, loosening of the mucous membrane, and other changes.\r\n    The action is particularly intense about the cæcum and sigmoid\r\n    flexure; in one case,[934] indeed, there was little inflammatory\r\n    redness of the stomach or of the greater portion of the intestine,\r\n    but the whole surface of the cæcum was of a deep black-red colour,\r\n    and there were patches of sloughing in the coats. The kidneys are\r\n    often swollen, congested, or inflamed; changes in the respiratory\r\n    organs are not constantly seen, but in a majority of the cases there\r\n    have been redness and swelling of the larynx, trachea, and bronchi,\r\n    and sometimes hepatisation of smaller or larger portions of the\r\n    lung.\r\n\r\n[933] There is only one case of perforation on record.\r\n\r\n[934] _Lancet_, 1845, p. 700.\r\n\r\n    In St. George’s Hospital Museum, there are (from a patient dying in\r\n    the hospital) preparations which well illustrate what pathological\r\n    changes may be expected in any case surviving for a few days. The\r\n    patient was Francis L----, aged 45, admitted to the hospital,\r\n    February 27, 1842. He took a quantity of corrosive sublimate spread\r\n    on bread and butter, was immediately sick, and was unable to take as\r\n    much as he had intended. The stomach-pump and other remedies were\r\n    used. On the following day his mouth was sore, and on March 1st his\r\n    vision was dim; his mouth was drawn over to the right side, and he\r\n    lost power over the left eyelid, but he had no pain; he passed some\r\n    blood from the bowel. On the 2nd he passed much blood, and was\r\n    salivated; still no pain. On March 4, on the evening of the sixth\r\n    day, he expired; he was drowsy during the last day, and passed\r\n    watery evacuations.\r\n\r\n    Prep. 14a, Ser. ix., shows the pharynx, œsophagus, and tongue; there\r\n    is ulceration of the tonsils, and fibrinous exudation on the gullet.\r\n    The stomach (43b, 199) shows a large dark slough, three inches from\r\n    the cardiac extremity; the margin surrounding the slough is\r\n    thickened, ulcerated, and irregular in shape, the submucous tissue,\r\n    to some extent, being also thickened; there is fibrine in the ileum,\r\n    pharynx, and part of the larynx. The action extended to the whole\r\n    intestine, the rectum in prep. 145a, 36, is seen to be thickened,\r\n    and has numerous patches of effused fibrine.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact that the external application of corrosive\r\nsublimate causes inflammatory changes in the alimentary canal of nearly\r\nthe same intensity as if the poison had been swallowed. Thus, in the\r\ncase of the two girls mentioned _ante_ (p. 647), there was found an\r\nintense inflammation of the stomach and intestines, the mucous tissues\r\nbeing scarlet-red, swollen, and with numerous extravasations.\r\n\r\n§ 850. The effects of the nitrate of mercury are similar to the\r\npreceding; in the few cases which have been recorded, there has been\r\nintense redness, and inflammation of the stomach and intestines, with\r\npatches of ecchymosis. White precipitate, cyanide of mercury, mercuric\r\niodide, and mercurous sulphide (turpeth-mineral) have all caused\r\ninflammation, more or less intense, of the intestinal tract.\r\n\r\n§ 851. =Elimination of Mercury.=--The question of the channels by which\r\nmercury is eliminated is of the first importance. It would appear\r\ncertain that it can exist in the body for some time in an inactive\r\nstate, and then, from some change, be carried into the circulation and\r\nshow its effects.[935] Voit considers that mercury combines with the\r\nalbuminous bodies, separating upon their oxidation, and then becoming\r\nfree and active.[936]\r\n\r\n[935] Tuson gave a mare, first, 4 grains, and afterwards 5 grains of\r\ncorrosive sublimate twice a day; at the end of fourteen days, in a pint\r\nof urine no mercury was detected, but at the end of three weeks it was\r\nfound.\r\n\r\n[936] _Voit, Physiol. chem. Unters._, Augsburg, 1857.\r\n\r\nUllmann[937] found most mercury in the following order:--Kidneys, liver,\r\nspleen, a small quantity in the stomach, no mercury in the small\r\nintestine, but some in the large intestine; small weighable quantities\r\nin the heart and skeletal muscles, also in the lungs; but no mercury,\r\nwhen the dose was small, in brain, the salivary glands, abdominal\r\nglands, thyroid glands, the bile, or the bones.\r\n\r\n[937] _Chem. Centr._, 1892, ii. 941.\r\n\r\nThe main channel by which absorbed mercury passes out of the body is the\r\nkidneys, whilst mercurial compounds of small solubility are in great\r\npart excreted by the bowel. A. Bynssen,[938] after experimenting with\r\nmercuric chloride (giving ·015 to ·15 grm., with a little morphine\r\nhydrochlorate), came to the conclusion that it could be detected in the\r\nurine about two hours, and in the saliva about four hours, after its\r\nadministration; he considered that the elimination was finished in\r\ntwenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n[938] _Journal de l’Anat. et de Physiol._, 1872, No. 5, p. 500. On the\r\nseparation of mercury by the urine, see also Salkowsky in Virchow’s\r\n_Archiv_, 1866.\r\n\r\nFrom the body of a hound that, in the course of thirty-one days, took\r\n2·789 grms. of calomel (2·368 Hg) in eighty-seven doses, about 94 per\r\ncent. of the substance was recovered on analysis:--\r\n\r\n                                                 Mercurous\r\n                                                 Sulphide.\r\n                                                   Grms.\r\n  In the fæces,                                   2·1175\r\n    „    urine,                                   0·0550\r\n    „    brain, heart, lungs, spleen, pancreas,\r\n         kidneys, scrotum, and penis,             0·0090\r\n    „    liver,                                   0·0140\r\n    „    muscles,                                 0·0114\r\n                                                  ------\r\n                                                  2·2069\r\n\r\nThis equals 1·9 of metallic mercury.[939] Thus, of the whole 2·2 grms.\r\nof mercuric sulphide separated, over 95 per cent. was obtained from the\r\nfæces.\r\n\r\n[939] Riederer, in Buchner’s _Neues Repert. f. Pharm._, Bd. xvii. 3,\r\n257, 1868.\r\n\r\nThis case is of considerable interest, for there are recorded in\r\ntoxicological treatises a few cases of undoubted mercurial poisoning in\r\nwhich no poison had been detected, although there was ample evidence\r\nthat it had been administered by the mouth. In such cases, it is\r\nprobable that the whole length of the intestinal canal had not been\r\nexamined, and the analysis failed from this cause. When (as not\r\nunfrequently happens) the mercurial poison has entered by the skin, it\r\nis evident that the most likely localities are the urine, the liver, and\r\nthe kidneys.[940]\r\n\r\n[940] A woman died from the effects of a corrosive sublimate lotion\r\napplied by a quack to a wound in her leg. The writer found no poison in\r\nthe stomach, but separated a milligramme of metallic mercury from the\r\nliver; the urine and intestines were not sent.\r\n\r\nIn a case related by Vidal,[941] the _Liquor Bellostii_ (or solution of\r\nmercuric nitrate) was ordered by mistake instead of a liniment. Although\r\nexternally applied, it caused salivation, profuse diarrhœa, and death in\r\nnine days. The whole of the intestinal tract was found inflamed with\r\nextravasations, and mercury detected in the liver.\r\n\r\n[941] _Gaz. des Hôp._, Juillet 1864.\r\n\r\nIn any case of external application, if death ensues directly from the\r\npoison, evidence of its presence will probably be found; but too much\r\nstress must not be laid upon the detection of mercury, for, as Dr.\r\nTaylor says, “Nothing is more common than to discover traces of mercury\r\nin the stomach, bowels, liver, kidneys, or other organs of a dead\r\nbody.”[942]\r\n\r\n[942] Taylor, _Medical Jurisprudence_, i. p. 288.\r\n\r\n§ 852. =Tests for Mercury.=--Mercury, in combination and in the solid\r\nform, is most readily detected by mixing the substance intimately with\r\ndry anhydrous sodic carbonate, transferring the mixture to a glass tube,\r\nsealed at one end, and applying heat. If mercury be present, a ring of\r\nminute globules condenses in the cool part of the tube. If the quantity\r\nof mercury is likely to be very minute, it is best to modify the process\r\nby using a subliming cell (p. 258), and thus obtain the sublimate on a\r\ncircle of thin glass in a convenient form for microscopical examination.\r\nIf there is any doubt whether the globules are those of mercury or not,\r\nthis may be resolved by putting a fragment of iodine on the lower disc\r\nof the subliming cell, and then completing it by the disc which contains\r\nthe sublimate (of course, the supposed mercurial surface must be\r\nundermost); on placing the cell in a warm, light place, after a time the\r\nscarlet iodide is formed, and the identification is complete. Similarly,\r\na glass tube containing an ill-defined metallic ring of mercury can be\r\nsealed or corked up with a crystal of iodine, and, after a few hours,\r\nthe yellow iodide, changing to scarlet, will become apparent. There are\r\nfew (if any) tests of greater delicacy than this.\r\n\r\nMercury in solution can be withdrawn by acidulating the liquid, and then\r\ninserting either simply a piece of gold foil, gold wire, or bright\r\ncopper foil; or else, by a galvanic arrangement, such as iron wire wound\r\nround a gold coin, or gold foil attached to a rod of zinc; or, lastly,\r\nby the aid of gold or copper electrodes in connection with a battery. By\r\nany of these methods, mercury is obtained in the metallic state, and the\r\nmetal with its film can be placed in a subliming cell, and globules\r\ndeposited and identified, as before described.\r\n\r\nThe =Precipitating Reagents= for mercury are numerous: a solution of\r\nstannous chloride, heated with a solution of mercury, or any\r\ncombination, whether soluble or insoluble, reduces it to the metallic\r\nstate.\r\n\r\n=Mercurous Salts= in solution yield, with potash, soda, or lime, a black\r\nprecipitate of mercurous oxide. =Mercuric Salts=, a bright yellow\r\nprecipitate of mercuric oxide.\r\n\r\n=Mercurous Salts= yield black precipitates, with sulphides of ammonium\r\nand hydrogen. =Mercuric Salts= give a similar reaction, but, with\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen, first a whitish precipitate, passing slowly\r\nthrough red to black.\r\n\r\n=Mercurous Salts=, with solutions of the chlorides, give a white\r\nprecipitate of calomel; the =Mercuric Salts= yield no precipitate under\r\nsimilar circumstances. =Mercurous Salts=, treated with iodide of\r\npotassium, give a green mercurous iodide; =Mercuric=, a scarlet.\r\n\r\n§ 853. =The Detection of Mercury in Organic Substances and\r\nFluids.=--Ludwig’s process, previously described, is found in practice\r\nthe best. Fluids, such as urine, must be evaporated to dryness, and then\r\ntreated with hydrochloric acid. Such organs as the liver are cut up and\r\nboiled in 20 per cent. HCl. Distinct evidence of mercury in the liver\r\nhas been obtained on a piece of copper gauze, in a case where a child\r\nhad been given 2 grains of calomel before death. “Four ounces of the\r\nliver were treated with hydrochloric acid and water, and a small piece\r\nof pure copper placed in the acid liquid while warm, and kept there for\r\nabout forty-eight hours. It acquired a slight silvery lustre, and\r\nglobules of mercury were obtained from it by sublimation.”\r\n\r\nTo detect the cyanide of mercury may require special treatment, and\r\nVitali[943] recommends the following process:--The fluid is acidified\r\nwith tartaric acid and neutralised by freshly precipitated CaCO₃; a\r\nslight excess of hydric sulphide is added, and the flask allowed to rest\r\nfor twenty-four hours in the cold. Then a further quantity of SH₂ is\r\nadded, and a current of hydrogen passed through the liquid; the effluent\r\ngas is first made to bubble through a solution of bismuth nitrate in\r\ndilute nitric acid (for the purpose of absorbing SH₂), and then through\r\naqueous potash (to absorb HCl); in the first flask the analyst will\r\nseparate and identify mercury sulphide, while in the last flask there\r\nwill be potassic cyanide, which will respond to the usual tests.\r\n\r\n[943] _L’Orosi_, xii. 181-196.\r\n\r\nIn those cases where no special search is made for mercury, but an acid\r\n(hydrochloric) solution is treated with sulphuretted hydrogen, mercury\r\nis indicated by the presence of a black precipitate, which does not\r\ndissolve in warm nitric acid.\r\n\r\nThe further treatment of the black sulphide may be undertaken in two\r\nways:--\r\n\r\n(1) It is collected on a porcelain dish, with the addition of a little\r\nnitric acid, and evaporated to dryness in order to destroy organic\r\nmatter. Hydrochloric and a few drops of nitric acid are next added; the\r\naction is aided by a gentle heat, the solution finally evaporated to\r\ndryness on the water-bath, and the residue taken up by warm distilled\r\nwater. The solution is that of a persalt of mercury, and the mercury can\r\nbe separated by electrolysis, or indicated by the tests already\r\ndetailed.\r\n\r\n(2) The other method, and the most satisfactory, is to mix the sulphide\r\nwhile moist with dry carbonate of soda, make it into a pellet which will\r\neasily enter a reducing or subliming tube, dry it carefully, and obtain\r\na sublimate of metallic mercury.\r\n\r\nA neat method of recognising mercury when deposited as a film on copper\r\nhas been proposed by E. Brugnatelli:[944] the copper, after being\r\nwashed, is transferred to a glass vessel, and a porcelain lid, on which\r\na drop of gold chloride solution has been placed, adjusted over the\r\ndish. The whole is heated by a water-bath. The mercury vapour reduces\r\nthe gold chloride, and gold is deposited as a bluish-violet stain; 1/10\r\nmgrm. mercury may by this test be identified.\r\n\r\n[944] _Gazzetta_, xix. 418-422.\r\n\r\nOf special methods for the separation and detection of mercury,\r\nLudwig’s[945] is, without a doubt, the best when organic matters have to\r\nbe dealt with; the finely divided solid substances are boiled for some\r\nhours with hydrochloric acid, strength 20 per cent.; then the liquid is\r\ncooled to 60°, and potassic chlorate added in half gramme quantities\r\nuntil the dark liquid becomes clear; the liquid is cooled and filtered,\r\nand the substances on the filter washed with water. To the filtrate 5\r\ngrms. of zinc dust are added, and the liquid is violently shaken from\r\ntime to time; a second portion is afterwards added, and also vigorously\r\nshaken. After some hours the clear liquid is separated from the zinc and\r\nthe zinc washed, first with water, then with a little soda solution, and\r\nfinally, again with water. The zinc is now collected on a glass-wool\r\nfilter, treated with absolute alcohol to remove water, and dried by\r\nsuction in a stream of air. The zinc is put into a combustion-tube, the\r\ntube being drawn out into a thin capillary extremity, and a combustion\r\nmade, the mercury collecting at the capillary part. It is a necessary\r\nrefinement, should the zinc be contaminated with a trace of organic\r\nmatter, to pack the combustion-tube as follows:--First, the zinc dust on\r\nwhich any mercury present has been deposited, then a plug of asbestos;\r\nnext, some cupric oxide; and lastly, some pure zinc dust.\r\nBondzynski[946] prefers to use copper rather than zinc; for he says that\r\nzinc so frequently contains cadmium, which latter metal also gives a\r\nmirror, so that, unless the mercury is afterwards identified by turning\r\nit into an iodide, error may be caused.\r\n\r\n[945] _Zeit. f. physiolog. Chemie_, 1882, i. 495; _Chem. Centrblt._,\r\n1892, ii. 941.\r\n\r\n[946] _Zeit. f. anal. Chem._, xxxii. 302-305.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n§ 854. =Estimation of Mercury.=--All pharmaceutical substances\r\ncontaining mercury, as well as the sulphide prepared in the wet way, and\r\nminerals, are best dealt with by obtaining and weighing the metal in the\r\nsolid state. The assay is very simple and easy when carried out on the\r\nmethod that was first, perhaps, proposed by Domeyko. A glass tube (which\r\nshould not be too thin), closed at one end, is bent, as shown in the\r\nfigure, the diameter should be about three lines, the length from 7 to 8\r\ninches, the shorter arm not exceeding 2 inches. The powdered substance\r\nis mixed with two or three times its weight of litharge, and introduced\r\ninto the tube at _a_. The portion of the tube containing the mercury is\r\nat first heated gently, but finally brought to a temperature sufficient\r\nto fuse the substance and soften the glass. The mercury collects in an\r\nannular film at _b_ in the cooler limb, and may now, with a little\r\nmanagement of the lamp, be concentrated in a well-defined ring; the\r\nportion of the tube containing this ring is cut off, weighed, then\r\ncleansed from mercury, and reweighed. Many of the pharmaceutical\r\npreparations do not require litharge, which is specially adapted for\r\nores, and heating with sodic carbonate (in great excess) will suffice.\r\nMercury mixed with organic matter must be first separated as described,\r\nby copper or gold, the silvered foil rolled up, dried, introduced into\r\nthe bent tube, and simply heated without admixture with any substance;\r\nthe weight may be obtained either by weighing the foil before and after\r\nthe operation, or as above.\r\n\r\n§ 855. =Volumetric Processes for the Estimation of Mercury.=--When a\r\ngreat number of mercurial preparations are to be examined, a volumetric\r\nprocess is extremely convenient. There are several of these processes,\r\nsome adapted more particularly for mercuric, and others for mercurous\r\ncompounds. For mercuric, the method of Personne[947] is the best. The\r\nconversion of the various forms of mercury into corrosive sublimate may\r\nbe effected by evaporation with aqua regia, care being taken that the\r\nbath shall not be at a boiling temperature, or there will be a slight\r\nloss.\r\n\r\n[947] _Comptes Rendus_, lvi. 68; Sutton’s _Vol. Anal._, 177.\r\n\r\nPersonne prefers to heat with caustic soda or potash, and then pass\r\nchlorine gas into the mixture; the excess of chlorine is expelled by\r\nboiling, mercuric chloride in presence of an alkaline chloride not being\r\nvolatilised at 100°. The standard solutions required for this process\r\nare:--\r\n\r\n(1) 33·2 grms. of potassic iodide in 1 litre of water, 1 c.c. = 0·01\r\ngrm. Hg, or 0·01355 grm. HgCl₂.\r\n\r\n(2) A solution of mercuric chloride containing 13·55 grms. to the litre,\r\n1 c.c. = 0·1 grm. Hg.\r\n\r\nThe process is founded on the fact that, if a solution of mercuric\r\nchloride be added to one of potassic iodide, in the proportion of one of\r\nthe former to four of the latter, mercuric iodide is formed, and\r\nimmediately dissolved, until the balance is overstepped, when the red\r\ncolour is developed; the final reaction is very sharp, and with\r\nsolutions properly made is very accurate. The mercuric solution must\r\nalways be added to the alkaline iodide; a reversal of the process does\r\nnot answer. It therefore follows that the solution to be tested must be\r\nmade up to a definite bulk, and added to a known quantity of the\r\npotassic iodide until the red colour appears.\r\n\r\n=Mercurous Salts= may be titrated with great accuracy by a decinormal\r\nsolution of sodic chloride. This is added to the cold solution in very\r\nslight excess, the calomel filtered off, the filtrate neutralised by\r\npure carbonate of soda, and the amount of sodic chloride still unused\r\nfound by titration with nitrate of silver, the end reaction being\r\nindicated by chromate of potash. Several other volumetric processes are\r\nfully described in works treating upon this branch of analysis.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--PRECIPITATED BY HYDRIC SULPHIDE FROM A NEUTRAL SOLUTION.\r\n\r\nZinc--Nickel--Cobalt.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. ZINC.\r\n\r\n§ 856. =Zinc=--At. wt., 65; specific gravity, 6·8 to 7·1; fusing-point,\r\n412° (773° F.)--is a hard, bluish-white, brittle metal, with a\r\ncrystalline fracture. Between 100° and 150° it becomes ductile, and may\r\nbe easily wrought, but at a little higher temperature it again becomes\r\nbrittle, and at a bright red heat it fuses, and then volatilises, the\r\nfumes taking fire when exposed to the air. In analysis, zinc occurs\r\neither as a metallic deposit on a platinum foil or dish, or as a brittle\r\nbead, obtained by reducing a zinc compound with soda on charcoal.\r\n\r\nThe salts of zinc to be briefly described here are the carbonate, the\r\noxide, and the sulphide,--all of which are likely to occur in the\r\nseparation and estimation of zinc, and the sulphate and chloride,--salts\r\nmore especially found in commerce, and causing accidents from time to\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n§ 857. =Carbonate of Zinc=, in the native form of calamine, contains, as\r\nis well known, 64·8 per cent. of oxide of zinc; but the carbonate\r\nobtained in the course of an analysis by precipitating the neutral hot\r\nsolution of a soluble salt of zinc by carbonate of potash or soda, is\r\ncarbonate of zinc _plus_ a variable quantity of hydrated oxide of zinc.\r\nUnless the precipitation takes place at a boiling temperature, the\r\ncarbonic anhydride retains a portion of the oxide of zinc in solution.\r\nBy ignition of the carbonate, oxide of zinc results.\r\n\r\n§ 858. =Oxide of Zinc= (ZnO = 81; specific gravity, 5·612; Zn, 80·24, O,\r\n19·76) is a white powder when cool, yellow when hot. If mixed with\r\nsufficient powdered sulphur, and ignited in a stream of hydrogen, the\r\nsulphide is produced; if ignited in the pure state in a rapid stream of\r\nhydrogen gas, metallic zinc is obtained; but, if it is only a feeble\r\ncurrent, the oxide of zinc becomes crystalline, a portion only being\r\nreduced.\r\n\r\n§ 859. =Sulphide of Zinc= (ZnS = 97; specific gravity, 4·1; Zn, 67·01,\r\nS, 32·99).--The sulphide obtained by treating a neutral solution of a\r\nsoluble salt of zinc by hydric sulphide is hydrated sulphide, insoluble\r\nin water, caustic alkalies, and alkaline sulphides, but dissolving\r\ncompletely in nitric or in hydrochloric acid. When dry, it is a white\r\npowder, and if ignited contains some oxide of zinc. The anhydrous\r\nsulphide is produced by mixing the precipitated sulphide with sulphur,\r\nand igniting in a crucible in a stream of hydrogen gas.\r\n\r\n=Pharmaceutical Preparations.=--The officinal compounds of zinc used in\r\nmedicine are the _acetate_, _carbonate_, _chloride_, _oxide_,\r\n_sulphate_, _sulphocarbolate_, and _valerianate_.\r\n\r\n=Sulphate of Zinc= (ZnSO₄7H₂O 161 + 126; specific gravity, crystals,\r\n1·931).--This salt is officinal in all the pharmacopœias, is used in\r\ncalico-printing, and is commonly known as _white vitriol_. By varying\r\nthe temperature at which the crystals are allowed to be formed, it may\r\nbe obtained with 6, 5, 2, or 1 atoms of water. The commercial sulphate\r\nis in crystals exactly similar to those of Epsom salts; it is slightly\r\nefflorescent, and gives the reactions of zinc and sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\n§ 860. =Chloride of Zinc= is obtained by dissolving zinc in hydrochloric\r\nacid, or by direct union of zinc and chlorine. Chloride of zinc is the\r\nonly constituent in the well-known “Burnett’s disinfectant fluid.” A\r\nsolution of chloride of zinc may be heated until it becomes water-free;\r\nwhen this takes place it still remains fluid, and makes a convenient\r\nbath, for warmth may be applied to it above 370° without its emitting\r\nfumes to inconvenience; at a red heat it distils. A concentrated\r\nsolution of zinco-ammonic chloride (2H₄NClZnCl₂) is used for the purpose\r\nof removing the film of oxide from various metals preparatory to\r\nsoldering.\r\n\r\n§ 861. =Zinc in the Arts.=--The use of zinc as a metal in sheeting\r\ncisterns, articles for domestic use, alloys, &c., is well known; oxide\r\nof zinc enters largely into the composition of india-rubber. Sulphide of\r\nzinc has been employed as a substitute for white lead, and may possibly\r\nsupersede it. Zinc white is further employed as a pigment, and, mixed\r\nwith albumen, is an agent in calico-printing; it is also used in the\r\ndecoloration of glass, in the polishing of optical glasses, and in the\r\nmanufacture of artificial meerschaum pipes.[948]\r\n\r\n[948] Artificial meerschaum pipes are composed of zinc white, magnesia\r\nusta, and caseine ammonium.\r\n\r\n=Chromate of Zinc= (ZnCrO₄) is used in calico-printing, and there is\r\nalso in commerce a basic chromate known as _zinc yellow_. Zinc green, or\r\nRinman’s green, is a beautiful innocuous colour, formed by igniting a\r\nmixture of dry zincic and cobaltous carbonates.\r\n\r\nThe use of zinc vessels in the preparation of foods may occasionally\r\nbring the metal under the notice of the analyst. When exposed to a moist\r\natmosphere, zinc becomes covered with a thin film of oxide, perfectly\r\ninsoluble in ordinary water; but, if the water should be charged with\r\ncommon salt, a considerable quantity may be dissolved. It may generally\r\nbe laid down as a rule that the solvent power of water on zinc has a\r\ndirect relation to the chlorides present, whilst carbonate of lime\r\ngreatly diminishes this solubility.[949]\r\n\r\n[949] Ziurek, indeed, found in a litre of water contained in a zinc\r\ncistern no less than 1·0104 grm. of zinc, and the same water showed only\r\n0·074 grm. of common salt to the litre.--_Vierteljahrsschr. für gericht.\r\nMedicin_, 1867, Bd. 6, p. 356.\r\n\r\nMilk may become contaminated by zinc; for, it is a matter of common\r\nknowledge, that milk contained in zinc vessels does not readily turn\r\nsour. This may be explained by the zinc oxide combining with the lactic\r\nacid, and forming the sparingly soluble lactate of zinc 2(C₃H₅O₃)Zn +\r\n3H₂O, thus withdrawing the lactic acid as fast as it is formed,\r\npreventing the coagulation of the casein. With regard to this important\r\npractical subject, MM. Payne and Chevallier made several experiments on\r\nthe action of brandy, wine, vinegar, olive oil, soup, milk, &c., and\r\nproved that zinc is acted on by all these, and especially by alcoholic,\r\nacetic, and saline liquids. M. Schaufféle has repeated these\r\nexperiments, and determined the amount of zinc dissolved in fifteen\r\ndays by different liquids from a galvanised iron as well as a zinc\r\nvessel.\r\n\r\nThe amount found was as follows:--\r\n\r\n                                         The liquid from\r\n                     The liquid from     the galvanised\r\n                     the zinc vessel,     iron vessel,\r\n                     grms. per litre.    grms. per litre.\r\n  Brandy,                 0·95                0·70\r\n  Wine,                   3·95                4·10\r\n  Orange-flower water,    0·50                0·75\r\n  Vinegar,               31·75               60·75\r\n  Fatty soup,             0·46                1·00\r\n  Weak soup,              0·86                1·76\r\n  Milk,                   5·13                7·00\r\n  Salt water,             1·75                0·40\r\n  Seltzer water,          0·35                0·30\r\n  Distilled water,       traces.             traces.\r\n  Ordinary water,        traces.             traces.\r\n  Olive oil,             none.               none.\r\n\r\n§ 862. =Effects of Zinc, as shown by Experiments on Animals.=--Harnack,\r\nin experiments with sodium-zinc oxide pyrophosphate, has shown that the\r\nessential action of zinc salts is to paralyse the muscles of the body\r\nand the heart, and, by thus affecting the circulation and respiration,\r\nto cause death; these main results have been fully confirmed by Blake,\r\nLetheby, and C. Ph. Falck. For rabbits the lethal dose is ·08 to ·09\r\ngrm. of zinc oxide, or about ·04 per kilogrm. The temperature during\r\nacute poisoning sinks notably--according to F. A. Falck’s researches on\r\nrabbits, from about 7·3° to 13·0°. Zinc is eliminated mainly by the\r\nurine, and has been recognised in that fluid four to five days after the\r\nlast dose. It has also been separated in small quantity from the milk\r\nand the bile.\r\n\r\n§ 863. =Effects of Zinc Compounds on Man=--(=a=) =Zinc Oxide=.--The\r\npoisonous action of zinc oxide is so weak that it is almost doubtful\r\nwhether it should be considered a poison. Dr. Marcett has given a pound\r\n(453·6 grms.) during a month in divided doses without injury to a\r\npatient afflicted with epilepsy; and the workmen in zinc manufactories\r\ncover themselves from head to foot with the dust without very apparent\r\nbad effects. It is not, however, always innocuous, for Popoff has\r\nrecorded it as the cause of headache, pain in the head, cramps in the\r\ncalves of the legs, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhœa; and he also obtained\r\nzinc from the urine of those suffering in this manner.[950] Again, a\r\npharmacy student[951] filled a laboratory with oxide of zinc vapour, and\r\nsuffered from well-marked and even serious poisonous symptoms,\r\nconsisting of pain in the head, vomiting, and a short fever. It must be\r\nremembered that, as the ordinary zinc of commerce is seldom free from\r\narsenic, and some samples contain gallium, the presence of these metals\r\nmay possibly have a part in the production of the symptoms described.\r\n\r\n[950] The so-called “zinc fever” has only been noticed in the founding\r\nof brass; it is always preceded by well-marked shivering, the other\r\nsymptoms being similar to those described.\r\n\r\n[951] Rust’s _Magazin_, Bd. xxi. § 563.\r\n\r\n§ 864. (=b=) =Sulphate of Zinc.=--Sulphate of zinc has been very\r\nfrequently taken by accident or design, but death from it is rare. The\r\ninfrequency of fatal result is due, not to any inactivity of the salt,\r\nbut rather to its being almost always expelled by vomiting, which is so\r\nconstant and regular an effect, that in doses of 1·3 grm. (20 grains),\r\nsulphate of zinc is often relied upon in poisoning from other substances\r\nto quickly expel the contents of the stomach. In a case reported by Dr.\r\nGibb, an adult female swallowed 4·33 grms. (67 grains), but no vomiting\r\noccurred, and it had to be induced by other emetics; this case is\r\nunique. It is difficult to say what would be a fatal dose of zinc\r\nsulphate, but the serious symptoms caused by 28 grms. (1 oz.) in the\r\ncase of a groom in the service of Dr. Mackenzie, leads to the view that,\r\nalthough not fatal in that particular instance, it might be in others.\r\nThe man took it in mistake for Epsom salts: a few minutes after he was\r\nviolently sick and purged, and was excessively prostrated, so that he\r\nhad to be carried to his home; the following day he had cramps in the\r\nlegs, and felt weak, but was otherwise well.\r\n\r\nIn a criminal case related by Tardieu and Roussin, a large dose of zinc\r\nsulphate, put into soup, caused the death of an adult woman of sixty\r\nyears of age in about thirty hours.[952] The symptoms were violent\r\npurging and vomiting, leading to collapse. From half of the soup a\r\nquantity of zinc oxide, equal to 1·6 grm. of zinc sulphate, was\r\nseparated. Zinc was also found in the stomach, liver, intestines, and\r\nspleen--(see also a case of criminal poisoning recorded by\r\nChevallier).[953]\r\n\r\n[952] Taylor notices this case, but adds that she died in three days.\r\nThis is a mistake, as the soup was taken on the 12th of June, probably\r\nat mid-day, and the woman died on the 13th, at 8 P.M.\r\n\r\n[953] “Observations toxicologiques sur le zinc,” _Annales d’Hygiène\r\nPublique_, July 1878, p. 153.\r\n\r\n§ 865. (=c=) =Zinc Chloride.=--Chloride of zinc is a powerful poison,\r\nwhich may kill by its primary or secondary effects; its local action as\r\na caustic is mainly to be ascribed to its intense affinity for water,\r\ndehydrating any tissue with which it comes in contact. The common use of\r\ndisinfecting fluids containing zinc chloride, such as Burnett’s fluid,\r\nleads to more accidents in England than in any other European country.\r\nOf twenty-six cases of poisoning by this agent, twenty-four occurred in\r\nEngland, and only two on the Continent. Death may follow the external\r\nuse of zinc chloride. Some years ago, a quack at Barnstaple, Devon,\r\napplied zinc chloride to a cancerous breast; the woman died with all\r\nthe general symptoms of poisoning by zinc, and that metal was found in\r\nthe liver and other organs.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms observed in fatal cases of chloride of zinc poisoning\r\nare--immediate pain in the throat, and burning of the lips, tongue, &c.\r\nThere is difficulty in swallowing, an increase in the secretion of\r\nsaliva, vomiting of bloody matters, diarrhœa, collapse, coma, and death.\r\nIn some cases life has been prolonged for days; but, on the other hand,\r\ndeath has been known to occur in a few hours. In those cases in which\r\neither recovery has taken place, or in which death is delayed, nervous\r\nsymptoms rarely fail to make their appearance. In a case recorded by Dr.\r\nR. Hassall, 3 ounces of Burnett’s fluid were swallowed. The usual\r\nsymptoms of intense gastro-intestinal irritation ensued, but there was\r\nno purging until the third day; after the lapse of a fortnight, a train\r\nof nervous symptoms set in, indicated by a complete perversion of taste\r\nand smell. In other cases, aphonia, tetanic affections of groups of\r\nmuscles, with great muscular weakness and impairment of sight, have been\r\nnoticed. Very large doses of zinc chloride have been recovered from,\r\n_e.g._, a man had taken a solution equivalent to about 13 grms. (200\r\ngrains) of the solid chloride. Vomiting came on immediately, and there\r\nwas collapse, but he recovered in sixteen days. On the other hand, ·38\r\ngrm. (6 grains) has destroyed life after several weeks’ illness.\r\n\r\n§ 866. =Post-mortem Appearances.=--In poisoning by sulphate of zinc, the\r\nappearances usually seen are inflammation, more or less intense, of the\r\nmucous membrane of the stomach and bowels. In the museums of the London\r\nhospitals, I could only find (1882) a single specimen preserved\r\nillustrating the effects of this poison. This preparation is in St.\r\nGeorge’s Hospital Museum, and shows (ser. ix. 43 and 198) the stomach of\r\na man who died from zinc sulphate, and whose case is reported in the\r\n_Lancet_, 1859. The mucous membrane is wrinkled all over like a piece of\r\ntripe; when recent it was vascular and indurated, but uniformly of a\r\ndirty grey colour; the lining membrane of the small intestine is very\r\nvascular, and in the duodenum and upper part of the jejunum the colour\r\nis similar to that of the stomach, but in a less marked degree; the\r\nstomach and intestines are contracted.\r\n\r\nThe pathological appearances after chloride of zinc vary according to\r\nthe period at which death takes place. When it has occurred within a few\r\nhours, the lining membrane of the mouth and gullet shows a marked change\r\nin texture, being white and opaque, the stomach hard and leathery, or\r\nmuch corrugated or ulcerated. In cases in which life has been prolonged,\r\ncontractions of the gullet and stomach may occur very similar to those\r\ncaused by the mineral acids, and with a similar train of symptoms. In a\r\ncase which occurred under Dr. Markham’s[954] observation, a person died\r\nten weeks after taking the fatal dose, the first symptoms subsiding in a\r\nfew days, and the secondary set of symptoms not commencing for three\r\nweeks. They then consisted mainly of vomiting, until the patient sank\r\nfrom exhaustion. The stomach was constricted at the pyloric end, so that\r\nit would scarcely admit a quill.\r\n\r\n[954] _Med. Times and Gazette_, June 11, 1859, p. 595.\r\n\r\nIn Guy’s Hospital there is a good preparation, 1799³⁵, from the case of\r\nS. R., aged 22; she took a tablespoonful of Burnett’s fluid, and died in\r\nabout fourteen weeks. There were at first violent vomiting and purging,\r\nbut she suffered little pain, and in a day or two recovered sufficiently\r\nto move about the house; but the vomiting after food continued,\r\neverything being ejected about five minutes after swallowing. Before\r\ndeath she suffered from pneumonia. The stomach is seen to be much\r\ncontracted--5 inches in length; it is ulcerated both near the pylorus\r\nand near the gullet; at the latter part there is a pouch-like portion of\r\nthe mucous membrane of the stomach adherent to the spleen, which\r\ncommunicates by a perforation with an abscess formed and bounded by the\r\nstomach, diaphragm, and spleen; it contained 3 ozs. of dirty-looking\r\npus. At the pylorus, in the centre, there is a second perforation, but\r\nextravasation of the contents is prevented by the adherent omentum and\r\ntransverse colon. The muscular coats are thickened.\r\n\r\n§ 867. =Detection of Zinc in Organic Liquids or Solids.=--In cases where\r\nthe poison has been expelled from the stomach by vomiting, the muscles\r\nand bones would appear to be the best tissues to examine chemically; for\r\nMatzkewitsch investigated very carefully a dog poisoned by 100 parts of\r\nzinc, subcutaneously injected in the form of acetate, and found it\r\ndistributed over the several organs of the body in the following\r\nratios:--Muscles 60·5, bones 24·41, stomach and intestines 4·63, skin\r\n3·70, place of injection 2·19, liver 1·75, lungs and heart 1·68,\r\nkidneys, bladder, and urine 1·14.\r\n\r\nThe only certain method of detection is to produce the sulphide of zinc,\r\nbest effected by saturating a neutral or feebly acid liquid with hydric\r\nsulphide. If an organic liquid, which can be easily filtered, is\r\noperated upon, it may be strongly acidulated with acetic acid, and at\r\nonce treated with hydric sulphide. If, however, zinc is sought for as a\r\npart of a systematic examination (as will most likely be the case), the\r\nsolution will have been treated with hydrochloric acid, and already\r\ntested for arsenic, antimony, lead, &c., and filtered from any\r\nprecipitate. In such a case the hydrochloric acid must first be replaced\r\nby acetic, which is effected by adding a slight excess of sodic acetate;\r\nthe right quantity of the latter is easily known, if the hydrochloric\r\nacid originally added was carefully measured, and its specific gravity\r\nascertained; 3·72 of crystallised sodic acetate saturating one of HCl.\r\nLastly, should the distillation process, given at p. 49, have been\r\nadopted, the contents of the retort will only require to be treated\r\nwith water, filtered, and saturated with sulphuretted hydrogen. In any\r\nof the above cases, should a white, dirty white or lightish-coloured\r\nprecipitate (which is not sulphur) be thrown down, zinc may be\r\nsuspected; it will, however, be absolutely necessary to identify the\r\nsulphide, for there are many sources of error. The most satisfactory of\r\nall identifications is the production of Rinman’s green. The supposed\r\nsulphide is dissolved off the filter with hot nitric acid, a drop or\r\nmore (according to the quantity of the original precipitate) of solution\r\nof cobalt nitrate added, the solution precipitated with carbonate of\r\nsoda and boiled, to expel all carbonic anhydride; the precipitate is\r\nthen collected on a filter, washed, dried, and ignited in a platinum\r\ndish. If zinc be present in so small a proportion as 1·100,000 part, the\r\nmass will be permanently green.\r\n\r\n§ 868. Other methods of procedure are as follows:--The supposed zinc\r\nsulphide (after being well washed) is collected in a porcelain dish, and\r\ndissolved in a few drops of sulphuric acid, filtered, nitric acid added,\r\nevaporated to dryness, and heated to destroy all organic matter. When\r\ncool, the mass is treated with water acidulated by sulphuric acid, and\r\nagain filtered. The solution may contain iron as well as zinc, and if\r\nthe former (on testing a drop with ferrocyanide of potash) appears in\r\nany quantity, it must be separated by the addition of ammonia in excess\r\nto the ammoniacal filtrate; sodic carbonate is added in excess, the\r\nliquid well boiled, and the precipitate collected on a filter and\r\nwashed. The carbonate of zinc thus obtained is converted into zinc oxide\r\nby ignition, and weighed. If oxide of zinc, it will be yellow when hot,\r\nwhite when cold: it will dissolve in acetic acid; give a white\r\nprecipitate with sulphuretted hydrogen; and, finally, if heated on\r\ncharcoal in the oxidising flame, and moistened with cobalt nitrate\r\nsolution, a green colour will result. Zinc may also be separated from\r\nliquids by electrolysis. The simplest way is to place the fluid under\r\nexamination in a platinum dish of sufficient size, acidify, and insert a\r\npiece of magnesium tape. The metallic film so obtained may be dissolved\r\nby hydrochloric acid, and the usual tests applied.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. NICKEL--COBALT.\r\n\r\n§ 869. The salts of nickel and cobalt have at present no toxicological\r\nimportance, although, from the experiments of Anderson Stuart,[955] both\r\nmay be classed as poisonous. The experiments of Gmelin had, prior to\r\nStuart’s researches, shown that nickel sulphate introduced into the\r\nstomach acted as an irritant poison, and, if introduced into the blood,\r\ncaused death by cardiac paralysis. Anderson Stuart, desiring to avoid\r\nall local irritant action, dissolved nickel carbonate in acid citrate of\r\nsoda by the aid of a gentle heat; he then evaporated the solution, and\r\nobtained a glass which, if too alkaline, was neutralised by citric acid,\r\nuntil its reaction approximated to the feeble alkalinity of the blood;\r\nthe cobalt salt was produced in the same way. The animals experimented\r\non were frogs, fish, pigeons, rats, guinea-pigs, rabbits, cats, and\r\ndogs--in all 200. The lethal dose of nickelous oxide, when\r\nsubcutaneously injected in the soluble compound described, was found to\r\nbe as follows:--frogs, ·08 grm. per kilogram; pigeons, ·06; guinea-pigs,\r\n·030; rats, ·025; cats, ·01; rabbits, ·009; and dogs, ·007. The\r\ncobaltous oxide was found to be much less active, requiring the above\r\ndoses to be increased about two-thirds. In other respects, its\r\nphysiological action seems to be very similar to that of nickelous\r\noxide.\r\n\r\n[955] “Nickel and Cobalt; their Physiological Action on the Animal\r\nOrganism,” by T. P. Anderson Stuart, M.D., _Journ. of Anat. and\r\nPhysiol._, vol. xvii., Oct. 1882.\r\n\r\n§ 870. =Symptoms--Frogs.=--A large dose injected into the dorsal lymph\r\nsac of the frog causes the following symptoms:--The colour of the skin\r\nall over the body becomes darker and more uniform, and not infrequently\r\na white froth is abundantly poured over the integument. In an interval\r\nof about twenty minutes the frog sits quietly, the eyes retracted and\r\nshut; if molested, it moves clumsily. When quiet, the fore limbs are\r\nweak, and the hind legs drawn up very peculiarly, the thighs being\r\njammed up so against the body, that they come to lie on the dorsal\r\naspect of the sides of the frog, and the legs are so much flexed that\r\nthe feet lie on the animal’s back, quite internal to the plane of the\r\nthighs. Soon fibrillary twitchings are observed in the muscles of the\r\nabdominal wall, then feeble twitchings of the fingers, and muscles of\r\nthe fore limbs generally; lastly, the toes are seen to twitch, and then\r\nthe muscles of the hind limbs--this order is nearly always observed; now\r\nspasmodic gaping and incoördinate movements are seen, and the general\r\naspect is not unlike the symptoms caused by picrotoxin. After this,\r\ntetanus sets in, and the symptoms then resemble those of strychnine; the\r\nnext stage is stupefaction and voluntary motor paresis; the respiratory\r\nmovements become feeble, and the paresis passes into paralysis. The\r\nheart beats more and more slowly and feebly, and death gradually and\r\nimperceptibly supervenes. The _post-mortem_ appearances are well marked,\r\n_i.e._, rigor mortis, slight congestion of the alimentary tract, the\r\nheart with the auricle much dilated and filled with dark blood, the\r\nventricle mostly small, pale, and semi-contracted. For some time after\r\ndeath, the nerve trunks and muscles react to the induction current.\r\n\r\n=Pigeons.=--In experiments on pigeons the symptoms were those of dulness\r\nand stupor, jerkings of different sets of muscles, and then death\r\nquietly.\r\n\r\n=Guinea-pigs.=--In guinea-pigs there were dulness and stupefaction, with\r\nsome weakness of the hind limbs.\r\n\r\n=Rats.=--The symptoms in rats were almost entirely nervous; they became\r\ndrowsy and apathetic, and there was paralysis of the hind legs.\r\n\r\n=Rabbits.=--In rabbits, also, the symptoms were mainly those caused by\r\nan affection of the nervous system. There was paralysis, which affected\r\neither the hind legs only, or all four limbs. The cervical muscles\r\nbecame so weak that the animal was unable to hold its head up. Diarrhœa\r\noccurred and persisted until death. If the dose is not large enough to\r\nkill rapidly, the reflex irritability is decidedly increased, so that\r\nthe slightest excitation may cause the animal to cower and tremble all\r\nover. Now appear twitchings and contractions of single groups of\r\nmuscles, and this excitement becomes general. The respirations also\r\nbecome slower and more difficult, and sometimes there is well-marked\r\ndilatation of the vessels of the ears and _fundi oculi_. Convulsions\r\nclose the scene.\r\n\r\n§ 871. =Circulation.=--The effect of the salt on the frog’s heart was\r\nalso studied in detail. It seems that, under the influence of a soluble\r\nsalt of nickel, the heart beats more and more slowly, it becomes smaller\r\nand paler, and does not contract evenly throughout the whole extent of\r\nthe ventricle; but the rhythm of the ventricular and auricular\r\ncontractions is never lost.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that there is a vaso-motor paralysis of the abdominal\r\nvessels; the blood-pressure falls, and the heart is not stimulated by\r\nthe blood itself as in its normal state. In support of this view, it is\r\nfound that, by either pressing on the abdomen or simply inverting the\r\nfrog, the heart swells up, fills with blood, and for a time beats well.\r\n\r\n=Nervous System.=--The toxic action is referable to the central nervous\r\nsystem, and not to that of peripheral motor nerve-endings or motor\r\nnerve-fibres. It is probable that both nickel and cobalt paralyse to\r\nsome extent the cerebrum. The action on the nerve-centres is similar to\r\nthat of platinum or barium, and quite different from that of iron.\r\n\r\n§ 872. =Action on Striped Muscle.=--Neither nickel nor cobalt has any\r\neffect on striped muscle. In this they both differ from arsenic,\r\nantimony, mercury, lead, and iron--all of which, in large doses,\r\ndiminish the work which healthy muscle is capable of performing.\r\n\r\n§ 873. =Separation of Nickel or Cobalt from the Organic Matters or\r\nTissues.=--It is very necessary, if any case of poisoning should occur\r\nby either or both of these metals, to destroy completely the organic\r\nmatters by the process already detailed on p. 51. Both nickel and cobalt\r\nare thrown down, if in the form of acetate, from a neutral solution by\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen; but the precipitation does not take place in the\r\npresence of free mineral acid; hence, in the routine process of\r\nanalysis, sulphuretted hydrogen is passed into the acid liquid, and any\r\nprecipitate filtered off. The liquid is now made almost neutral by\r\npotassic carbonate, and then potassic acetate added, and a current of\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen passed through it. The sulphides of cobalt and\r\nnickel, if both are present, will be thrown down; under the same\r\ncircumstances zinc, if present, would also be precipitated. Cobalt is\r\nseparated from zinc by dissolving the mixed sulphides in nitric acid,\r\nprecipitating the carbonates of zinc and cobalt by potassic carbonate,\r\ncollecting the carbonates, and, after washing, igniting them gently in a\r\nbulb tube, in a current of dry hydrochloric acid; volatile zinc chloride\r\nis formed and distils over, leaving cobalt chloride.\r\n\r\n§ 874. To estimate cobalt, sulphide of cobalt may be dissolved in nitric\r\nacid, and then precipitated by pure potash; the precipitate washed,\r\ndried, ignited, and weighed; 100 parts of cobaltous oxide (Co₃O₄) equals\r\n73·44 of metallic cobalt. Cobalt is separated from nickel by a method\r\nessentially founded on one proposed by Liebig. The nitric acid solution\r\nof nickel and cobalt (which must be free from all other metals, save\r\npotassium or sodium) is nearly neutralised by potassic carbonate, and\r\nmixed with an excess of hydrocyanic acid, and then with pure caustic\r\npotash. The mixture is left exposed to the air in a shallow dish for\r\nsome hours, a tripotassic cobalticyanide (K₃CoCy₆) and a\r\nnickelo-potassic cyanide (2KCy, NiCy₄) are in this way produced. If this\r\nsolution is now boiled with a slight excess of mercuric nitrate,\r\nhydrated nickelous oxide is precipitated, but potassic cobalticyanide\r\nremains in solution, and may be filtered off. On carefully neutralising\r\nthe alkaline filtrate with nitric acid, and adding a solution of\r\nmercurous nitrate, the cobalt may then be precipitated as a mercurous\r\ncobalticyanide, which may be collected, washed, dried, decomposed by\r\nignition, and weighed as cobaltous oxide. After obtaining both nickel\r\nand cobalt oxides, or either of them, they may be easily identified by\r\nthe blowpipe. The oxide of nickel gives, in the oxidising flame with\r\nborax, a yellowish-red glass, becoming paler as it cools; the addition\r\nof a potassium salt colours the bead blue. In the reducing flame the\r\nmetal is reduced, and can be seen as little greyish particles\r\ndisseminated through the bead. Cobalt gives an intense blue colour to a\r\nbead of borax in the oxidising flame.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.--PRECIPITATED BY AMMONIUM SULPHIDE.\r\n\r\nIron--Chromium--Thallium--Aluminium--Uranium.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. IRON.\r\n\r\n§ 875. It was Orfila’s opinion that all the salts of iron were\r\npoisonous, if given in sufficient doses; but such salts as the\r\ncarbonate, the phosphate, and a few others, possessing no local action,\r\nmay be given in such very large doses, without causing disturbance to\r\nthe health, that the statement must only be taken as applying to the\r\nmore soluble iron compounds. The two preparations of iron which have any\r\nforensic importance are the perchloride and the sulphate.\r\n\r\n§ 876. =Ferric Chloride= (Fe₂Cl₆ = 325).--Anhydrous ferric chloride will\r\nonly be met with in the laboratory. As a product of passing dry chlorine\r\nover red-hot iron, it sublimes in brown scales, is very deliquescent,\r\nand hisses when thrown into water. There are two very definite\r\nhydrates--one with 6 atoms of water, forming large, red, deliquescent\r\ncrystals; and another with 12 of water, less deliquescent, and\r\ncrystallising in orange stellate groups.\r\n\r\nThe pharmaceutical preparations in common use are:--\r\n\r\n=Stronger Solution of Perchloride of Iron= (=Liquor Ferri Perchloridi\r\nFortior=).--An orange-brown liquid of specific gravity 1·42, and\r\ncontaining about 58 per cent. of ferric chloride.\r\n\r\n=Tincture of Perchloride of Iron= (=Tinctura Ferri Perchloridi=), made\r\nby diluting 1 part of the strong solution with 1 volume of rectified\r\nspirit, and adding distilled water to measure 4.\r\n\r\n=Solution of Perchloride of Iron= (=Liquor Ferri Perchloridi=).--Simply\r\n5 volumes of the strong solution made up to 20 by the addition of water;\r\nhence, of the same strength as the tincture.\r\n\r\n§ 877. =Effects of Ferric Chloride on Animals.=--A very elaborate series\r\nof researches on rabbits, dogs, and cats was undertaken a few years ago\r\nby MM. Bérenger-Féraud and Porte[956] to elucidate the general symptoms\r\nand effects produced by ferric chloride under varying conditions. First,\r\na series of experiments showed that, when ferric chloride solution was\r\nenclosed in gelatine capsules and given with the food of the animal, it\r\nproduced either no symptoms or but trifling inconvenience, even when the\r\ndose exceeded 1 grm. per kilogrm.; anhydrous ferric chloride and the\r\nferric chloride solution were directly injected into the stomach, yet,\r\nwhen food was present, death did not occur, and the effects soon\r\nsubsided. In animals which were fasting, quantities of the solution\r\nequal to ·5 grm. per kilogrm. and above caused death in from one hour to\r\nsixteen hours, the action being much accelerated by the addition of\r\nalcohol--as, for example, in the case of the tincture: the symptoms were\r\nmainly vomiting and diarrhœa, sometimes the vomiting was absent. In a\r\nfew cases the posterior extremities were paralysed, and the pupils\r\ndilated: the urine was scanty or quite suppressed; death was preceded by\r\nconvulsions.\r\n\r\n[956] “Étude sur l’empoisonnement par le perchlorure de fer,” par MM.\r\nBérenger-Féraud et Porte, _Annales d’Hygiène Publique_, 1879.\r\n\r\n§ 878. =Effects on Man.=--Perchloride of iron in the form of tincture\r\nhas been popularly used in England, from its supposed abortive property,\r\nand is sold under the name of “steel drops.” It has been frequently\r\ntaken by mistake for other dark liquids; and there is at least one case\r\non record in which it was proved to have been used for the purpose of\r\nmurder. The latter case[957] is peculiarly interesting from its great\r\nrarity; it occurred in Martinique in 1874-1876, no less than four\r\npersons being poisoned at different dates. All four were presumed to\r\nhave had immoral relations with a certain widow X----, and to have been\r\npoisoned by her son. In three of the four cases, viz., Char----,\r\nDuf----, and Lab----, the cause of death seems pretty clear; but the\r\nfourth, Ab----, a case of strong suspicion, was not sufficiently\r\ninvestigated. All three took the fatal dose in the evening, between\r\neight and nine o’clock--Lab---- the 27th of December 1874, Duf---- the\r\n22nd of February 1876, and Char---- on the 14th of May 1876. They had\r\nall passed the day in tippling, and they all had eaten nothing from\r\nmid-day, so that the stomach would, in none of the three, contain any\r\nsolid matters. The chloride was given to them in a glass of “punch,” and\r\nthere was strong evidence to show that the son of the widow X----\r\nadministered it. Char---- died after about thirteen hours’ illness,\r\nDuf---- and Lab---- after sixty-five hours’ illness; Ab---- lived from\r\nthree to four days. With Char---- the symptoms were very pronounced in\r\nan hour, and consisted essentially of violent colicky pain in the\r\nabdomen and diarrhœa, but there was no vomiting; Duf---- had also great\r\npain in the abdomen and suppression of the urine. Lab---- had most\r\nviolent abdominal pains; he was constipated, and the urinary secretion\r\nwas arrested; there was besides painful tenesmus. According to the\r\nexperiments of Bérenger-Féraud and Porte,[958] the perchloride in the\r\nabove cases was taken under conditions peculiarly favourable for the\r\ndevelopment of its toxic action, viz., on an empty stomach and mixed\r\nwith alcohol.\r\n\r\n[957] Fully reported in Bérenger-Féraud’s paper, _loc. cit._\r\n\r\n[958] _Dub. Med. Press_, February 21, 1849.\r\n\r\nThere have been several cases of recovery from large doses of the\r\ntincture, _e.g._, that of an old man, aged 72, who had swallowed 85 c.c.\r\n(3 ozs.) of the tincture; the tongue swelled, there were croupy\r\nrespiration and feeble pulse, but he made a good recovery. In other\r\ncases,[959] 28·3 c.c. (an ounce) and more have caused vomiting and\r\nirritation of the urinary organs. The perchloride is not unfrequently\r\nused to arrest hæmorrhage as a topical application to the uterine\r\ncavity--a practice not free from danger, for it has before now induced\r\nviolent inflammation and death from peritonitis.\r\n\r\n[959] _Provincial Journal_, April 7 and 21, 1847, p. 180; see also\r\nTaylor’s _Principles and Practice of Medical Jurisprudence_, vol. i. p.\r\n320, 2nd Edition.\r\n\r\n§ 879. =Elimination of Iron Chloride.=--Most of the iron is excreted in\r\nthe form of sulphide by the fæces, and colours them of a black hue; a\r\nsmaller portion is excreted by the urine.\r\n\r\n§ 880. =Post-mortem Appearances.=--In the experiments on animals already\r\nreferred to, the general changes noted were dryness, pallor, and\r\nparchment-like appearance of the cavity of the mouth, the mucous\r\nmembrane being blackened by the contact of the liquid. The gullet was\r\npale and dry, not unfrequently covered with a blackish layer. The mucous\r\nmembrane of the stomach was generally healthy throughout; but, if the\r\ndose was large and very concentrated, there might be one or more\r\nhyperæmic spots; otherwise, this did not occur. The internal surface of\r\nthe intestines, similarly, showed no inflammation, but was covered with\r\nbrownish coating which darkened on exposure to the air. The liver, in\r\nall the experiments, was large and gorged with black and fluid blood;\r\nthere were ecchymoses in the lungs and venous congestion. The kidneys\r\nwere usually hyperæmic, and contained little hæmorrhages. There was also\r\ngeneral encephalic engorgement, and in one experiment intense congestion\r\nof the meninges was observed. Few opportunities have presented\r\nthemselves for pathological observations relative to the effects\r\nproduced by ferric chloride on man. In a case related by Christison, in\r\nwhich a man swallowed 42·4 c.c. (1½ oz.) of the tincture, and died in\r\nfive weeks, there was found thickening and inflammation of the pyloric\r\nend of the stomach.\r\n\r\nThe case of Char----, already alluded to, is that in which the most\r\ncomplete details of the autopsy are recorded, and they coincide very\r\nfairly with those observed in animals; the tongue was covered with a\r\ngreenish fur, bordered at the edges with a black substance, described as\r\nbeing like “mud”; the lining membrane of the gullet was pale, but also\r\ncovered with this dark “mud.” The stomach contained a greenish-black\r\nliquid; the liver was large and congested; the kidneys were swollen,\r\ncongested, and ecchymosed; the cerebral membranes were gorged with\r\nblood, and the whole brain hyperæmic.\r\n\r\n§ 881. =Ferrous Sulphate, Copperas, or Green Vitriol=, FeSO₄7H₂O = 152 +\r\n126; specific gravity, anhydrous, 3·138; crystals, 1·857; composition in\r\n100 parts, FeO, 25·92; SO₃, 28·77; H₂O, 45·32.--This salt is in\r\nbeautiful, transparent, bluish-green, rhomboidal prisms. The crystals\r\nhave an astringent, styptic taste, are insoluble in alcohol, but\r\ndissolve in about 1·5 times their weight of water; the commercial\r\narticle nearly always responds to the tests, both for ferrous and ferric\r\nsalts, containing a little persalt. The medicinal dose of this salt is\r\nusually given as from ·0648 to ·324 grm. (1 to 5 grains), but it has\r\nbeen prescribed in cases requiring it in gramme (15·4 grains) doses\r\nwithout injury. Sulphate of iron has many technical applications; is\r\nemployed by all shoemakers, and is in common use as a disinfectant. The\r\nsalt has been employed for criminal purposes in France, and in this\r\ncountry it is a popular abortive. In recorded cases, the symptoms, as\r\nwell as the pathological appearances, have a striking resemblance to\r\nthose produced by the chloride. There are usually colic, vomiting, and\r\npurging; but in one case (reported by Chevallier), in which a man gave a\r\nlarge dose of sulphate of iron to his wife, there was neither vomiting\r\nnor colic; the woman lost her appetite, but slowly recovered. Probably\r\nthe action of ferrous sulphate, like that of the chloride, is profoundly\r\nmodified by the presence or absence of food in the stomach. Anything\r\nlike 28·3 grms. (an ounce) of sulphate of iron must be considered a\r\ndangerous dose, for, though recovery has taken place from this quantity,\r\nthe symptoms have been of a violent kind.\r\n\r\n§ 882. =Search for Iron Salts in the Contents of the Stomach,\r\n&c.=--Iron, being a natural component of the body, care must be taken\r\nnot to confound the iron of the blood or tissues with the “iron” of a\r\nsoluble salt. Orfila attempted to distinguish between the two kinds of\r\niron by treating the contents of the stomach, the intestines, and even\r\nthe tissues, with cold acetic acid, and allowing them to digest in it\r\nfor many hours before filtering and testing for iron in the filtrate,\r\nand this is generally the process which has been adopted. The acid\r\nfiltrate is first treated with sulphuretted hydrogen, which gives no\r\nprecipitate with iron, and then with sulphide of ammonium, which\r\nprecipitates iron black. The iron sulphide may be dissolved by a little\r\nhydrochloric acid and a drop of nitric acid, and farther identified by\r\nits forming Prussian blue when tested by ferrocyanide of potash, or by\r\nthe bulky precipitate of oxide, when the acid liquid is alkalised by\r\nammonia. In the case of Duf----, the experts attempted to prove the\r\nexistence of foreign iron in the liver by taking 100 grms. of Duf----’s\r\nliver and 100 grms. of the liver of a non-poisoned person, and\r\ndestroying each by nitro-muriatic acid, and estimating in each acid\r\nsolution the ferric oxide. Duf----’s liver yielded in 100 parts ·08\r\nmgrm. of ferric oxide, the normal liver ·022--nearly three times less\r\nthan Duf----’s.\r\n\r\nTo obtain iron from the urine, the fluid must be evaporated down to a\r\nsyrup in a platinum dish, a little nitric acid added, heated, and\r\nfinally completely carbonised. The residue is dissolved in hydrochloric\r\nacid. Normal urine always contains an unweighable trace of iron; and,\r\ntherefore, any quantity, such as a mgrm. of ferric oxide, obtained by\r\ncareful precipitation of the hydrochloric acid solution out of 200 to\r\n300 c.c. of urine, would be good evidence that a soluble salt of iron\r\nhad been taken. The hydrochloric acid solution is first precipitated by\r\nammonia and ammonic sulphide. The precipitate thus obtained will not be\r\npure iron sulphide, but mixed with the earth phosphates. It should be\r\nredissolved in HCl, precipitated by sodic carbonate, then acidified by\r\nacetic acid and sodic acetate added, and the solution well boiled; the\r\niron will then be precipitated for the most part as oxide mixed with a\r\nlittle phosphate of iron.\r\n\r\nSince, as before mentioned, a great portion of the iron swallowed as a\r\nsoluble salt is converted into insoluble compounds and excreted by the\r\nfæces, it is, in any case where poisoning by iron is suspected, of more\r\nimportance to examine chemically the fæces and the whole length of the\r\nalimentary canal, than even the contents of the stomach. In particular,\r\nany black material lying on the mucous membrane may be sulphide of iron\r\nmixed with mucus, &c., and should be detached, dissolved in a little\r\nhydrochloric acid, and the usual tests applied.\r\n\r\nIn the criminal cases alluded to, there were iron stains on certain\r\nlinen garments which acquired an importance, for, on dissolving by the\r\naid of nitric acid, they gave the reactions of chlorine and iron. Any\r\nstains found should be cut out, steeped in water, and boiled. If no iron\r\nis dissolved the stain should then be treated with dilute nitric acid,\r\nand the liquid tested with ferrocyanide of potash, &c. It need scarcely\r\nbe observed that iron-mould is so common on shirts and any fabric\r\ncapable of being washed, that great care must be exercised in drawing\r\nconclusions from insoluble deposits of the oxide.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. CHROMIUM.\r\n\r\n§ 883. The only salts of chromium of toxicological importance are the\r\nneutral chromate of potash, the bichromate of potash, and the chromate\r\nof lead.\r\n\r\n=Neutral Chromate of Potash=, CrO₃K₂O = 194·7, containing 56·7 per cent.\r\nof its weight of chromic anhydride, CrO₃.--This salt is in the form of\r\ncitron-yellow rhombic crystals, easily soluble in water, but insoluble\r\nin alcohol. Its aqueous solution is precipitated yellow by lead acetate\r\nor basic acetate; the precipitate being insoluble in acetic acid. If\r\nchromate of potash in solution is tested with silver nitrate, the red\r\nchromate of silver is thrown down; the precipitate is with difficulty\r\nsoluble in dilute nitric acid.\r\n\r\n§ 884. =Potassic Bichromate=, CrO₃K₂O = 295·2, containing 68·07 per\r\ncent. of its weight of chromic anhydride, CrO₃.--This salt is in\r\nbeautiful large, red, transparent, four-sided tables; it is anhydrous\r\nand fuses below redness. At a high temperature it is decomposed into\r\ngreen oxide of chromium and yellow chromate of potash. It is insoluble\r\nin alcohol, but readily soluble in water. The solution gives the same\r\nprecipitates with silver, lead, and barium as the neutral chromate. On\r\ndigesting a solution of the bichromate with sulphuric acid and alcohol,\r\nthe solution becomes green from the formation of chromic oxide.\r\n\r\n§ 885. =Neutral Lead Chromate=, PbCrO₄ = 323·5, composition in 100\r\nparts, PbO, 68·94, CrO₃, 31·06.--This is technically known as “_Chrome\r\nYellow_,” and is obtained as a yellow precipitate whenever a solution of\r\nplumbic acetate is added, either to the solutions of potassic chromate\r\nor bichromate; by adding chrome yellow to fused potassic nitrate,\r\n“chrome red” is formed; it has the composition CrO₃2PbO. Neutral lead\r\nchromate is insoluble in acids, but may be dissolved by potassic or\r\nsodic hydrates.\r\n\r\n§ 886. =Use in the Arts.=--Potassic bichromate is extensively used in\r\nthe arts--in dyeing, calico-printing, the manufacture of porcelain, and\r\nin photography; the neutral chromate has been employed to a small extent\r\nas a medicine, and is a common laboratory reagent; lead chromate is a\r\nvaluable pigment.\r\n\r\n§ 887. =Effects of some of the Chromium Compounds on Animal Life.=--In\r\nthe chromates of potash there is a combination of two poisonous metals,\r\nso that it is not surprising that Gmelin found the chloride of chromium,\r\nCrCl₃, less active than the neutral chromate of potash; 1·9 grm. of the\r\nlast, administered to a rabbit by the stomach, caused death within two\r\nhours, while 3 grms. of chromous chloride had no action. Subcutaneous\r\ndoses of ·2 to ·4 grm. of neutral chromate (according to the experiments\r\nof E. Gergens[960] and Carl Posner[961]) act with great intensity on\r\nrabbits. Immediately after the injection the animals are restless, and\r\nshow marked dyspnœa; death often takes place within a few hours.\r\n\r\n[960] _Arch. f. experiment. Pathol. u. Pharmakol._, Bd. 6, Hft. 1 and 2,\r\n§ 148, 1875.\r\n\r\n[961] Virchow’s _Archiv f. path. Anat._, Bd. 79, Hft. 2, § 333, 1880.\r\n\r\nDiarrhœa does not seem, as a rule, to follow when the salt is\r\nadministered by subcutaneous injection to animals; but Gmelin’s rabbits\r\nhad considerable diarrhœa when 1·9 grm. was introduced into the stomach.\r\nThe same quantity, injected beneath the skin of a dog, caused loss of\r\nappetite, and, after six days, there was a dry exanthem on the back, and\r\nthe hair fell off in patches; there was, however, neither diarrhœa nor\r\nvomiting. Bichromate of potash causes (according to the researches of\r\nPelikan)[962] symptoms similar to those produced by arsenic or corrosive\r\nsublimate; it acts as a powerful irritant of the stomach and intestinal\r\ncanal, and may even cause inflammation; on its absorption a series of\r\nsymptoms are produced, of which the most prominent are albuminuria,\r\nbloody urine, and emaciation. From ·06 to ·36 grm. (1-5½ grains) is\r\nfatal to rabbits and dogs.\r\n\r\n[962] _Beiträge zur gerichtl. Medicin, Toxikol. u. Pharmakodynamik_,\r\nWürzburg, 1858.\r\n\r\n§ 888. =Effects of some of the Chromium Salts on Man--Bichromate\r\nDisease.=--In manufacturing potassic bichromate, the workmen exposed to\r\nthe dust have suffered from a very peculiar train of symptoms, known\r\nunder the name of “bichromate disease.” It was first described in\r\nEngland by Sir B. W. Richardson.[963] It appears that if the workmen\r\ninspire the particles chiefly through the mouth, a bitter and\r\ndisagreeable taste is experienced, with an increase of saliva. This\r\nincrease of the buccal secretion gets rid of most of the poison, and in\r\nthat case but little ill effect is experienced; but those who keep the\r\nmouth closed and inspire by the nose, suffer from an inflammation of the\r\nseptum, which gradually gets thin, and ultimately ulcerated; finally the\r\nwhole of the septum is in this way destroyed. It is stated that when a\r\nworkman has lost his nasal septum, he no longer suffers from nasal\r\nirritation, and has a remarkable immunity from catarrh. The Chemical\r\nWorks Committee of Inquiry report (1893) that the manufacture of\r\nbichromate of potash or soda is practically in the hands of three firms\r\nat Glasgow, Rutherglen, and Falkirk, and that they visited all of them,\r\nand found “that almost all the men working where dust was prevalent,\r\nmore especially between the furnaces and the dissolving tanks, had\r\neither perforation of the septum of the nose, or had lost the\r\nseptum altogether.” The bichromate also causes painful skin\r\naffections--eruptions akin to eczema or psoriasis; also very deep and\r\nintractable ulcerations. These the workers call “chrome holes.” These\r\ncutaneous maladies start from an excoriation; so long as the skin is not\r\nbroken, there seems to be little local effect, if any. The effects of\r\nthe bichromate are also seen in horses employed at the factories; the\r\nsalt getting into a wound or crack in the leg, produces ulceration:\r\nhorses may even lose their hoofs.\r\n\r\n[963] _Brit. and For. Med. Chirurg. Review_, Oct. 1863. See also a paper\r\nby the same writer, read before the Medical Society, reported in the\r\n_Lancet_, March 11, 1882.\r\n\r\n§ 889. Acute poisoning by the chromates is rare. In the ten years ending\r\n1892, in England and Wales, 4 accidental deaths are ascribed to potassic\r\nbichromate and 1 to chromic acid. Falck has, however, been able to find\r\nin medical literature 17 cases, 6 of which were suicidal, 10 accidental,\r\nand in 1 the bichromate was used as an abortive. In a case of poisoning\r\nby the chromate of potash (related by Maschka),[964] in which a woman,\r\naged 25, took for a suicidal purpose a piece of potassic chromate, which\r\nshe described as the size of a hazel-nut (it would probably be at least\r\n6 grms. in weight), the chief symptoms were vomiting, diarrhœa, pain in\r\nthe stomach, and rapid collapse; death took place fourteen hours after\r\nswallowing the poison.\r\n\r\n[964] _Prager Vierteljahrsschr. f. d. prakt. Heilk._, Bd. 131, § 37,\r\n1877; Schmidt’s _Jahrb._ 1878, Bd. 178, § 237. See also Schuchardt in\r\nMaschka’s _Handbuch_, Bd. ii. p. 3.\r\n\r\nIn poisoning by potassic bichromate, there may be much variety in the\r\nsymptoms, the more usual being those common to all irritant poisons,\r\n_i.e._, vomiting, diarrhœa, and collapse, with cramps in the limbs and\r\nexcessive thirst; and the rarer affecting more especially the nervous\r\nsystem, such as narcosis, paralysis of the lower limbs, and dilatation\r\nof the pupils; occasionally there is slight jaundice.\r\n\r\nIn a case recorded by Dr. Macniven,[965] a man took a lump of bichromate\r\nof potash, estimated to be over 2 drachms (7·7 grms.). The symptoms\r\ncommenced in fifteen minutes, and consisted of lightness in the head,\r\nand a sensation of great heat in the body, which was followed by a cold\r\nsweat; in twenty minutes he vomited; he then suffered from great pain in\r\nthe stomach, giddiness, specks before the eyes, a devouring thirst, and\r\nthere was loss of power over the legs. These symptoms, again, were\r\nfollowed by severe rigors and great coldness of the extremities. On the\r\npatient’s admission to hospital, two hours after taking the poison, it\r\nwas noted that the pupils were dilated, the face pale and cold, and the\r\npulse feeble. He complained of intense epigastric pain, and a feeling of\r\ndepression; there was some stupor; the stomach was emptied by emetics\r\nand by the stomach-pump, and the patient treated with tepid emollient\r\ndrinks, whilst subcutaneous doses of sulphuric ether were administered.\r\nHe made a good recovery.\r\n\r\n[965] “On a Case of Poisoning with Bichromate of Potash,” by Ed. O.\r\nMacniven, M.B., _Lancet_, Sept. 22, 1883.\r\n\r\nIn a case recorded by Mr. Wilson,[966] a man, aged 64, was found dead in\r\nhis bed twelve hours after he had gone to rest. During the night he was\r\nheard to snore loudly; there were no signs of vomiting or purging, and\r\nbichromate of potash was found in the stomach.[967]\r\n\r\n[966] _Med. Gazette_, vol. 33, 734.\r\n\r\n[967] See also cases recorded by Dr. M’Lachlan, _Glasgow Med. Journ._,\r\nJuly 1881; Dr. M’Crorie, _ibid._, May 1881; Dr. R. A. Warwick, _Lancet_,\r\nJan. 31, 1880; and Dr. Dunbar Walker, _ibid._, Sept. 27, 1879--a summary\r\nof all of which may be found in Dr. Macniven’s paper, _loc. cit._\r\n\r\n§ 890. Chromate of lead has also caused death. In one case[968] the\r\nbreathing of chromate of lead dust seems to have been fatal; and there\r\nis also a double poisoning recorded by Dr. Linstow,[969] of two\r\nchildren, aged three and a half and one and three-quarter years\r\nrespectively, who ate some yellow ornaments,[970] which were used to\r\nadorn a cake, and which contained chrome yellow (chromate of lead). The\r\nyounger died in two and the elder in five days. The symptoms were\r\nredness of the face, dulness, and an inclination to sleep; neither\r\ncomplained of pain; the younger one had a little diarrhœa, but the elder\r\nneither sickness nor purging.\r\n\r\n[968] _Ueber tödtliche Vergiftung durch Einathmen des Staubes von mit\r\nChromsäuren Blei-Oxyde gefärbten Garne.--Vierteljahrsschr. f. ger.\r\nMed._, 1877, Bd. xxvii. Hft. i. p. 29.\r\n\r\n[969] _Ibid._, Bd. xx. s. 60, 1874.\r\n\r\n[970] The ornaments were imitations of bees; each contained ·27 grm. gum\r\ntragacanth, ·0042 grm. neutral lead chromate.\r\n\r\n§ 891. =Post-mortem Appearances.=--We possess some very exact\r\nresearches[971] upon the pathological changes induced by subcutaneous\r\ninjections of solutions of potassic bichromate on animals, and\r\nespecially on the changes which the kidneys undergo. If the animal is\r\nkilled, or dies a few hours after the injection, there are apparently no\r\nstriking appearances, but a closer microscopical examination shows\r\nconsiderable changes. The epithelium of the tubuli contorti exhibits a\r\nyellow cloudiness, and the outline of the cells is irregular and jagged.\r\nThe glomeruli are moderately injected, and their capsules contain an\r\nalbuminous exudation; the canaliculi are filled with round cells\r\nimbedded in a fluid which, on heating, coagulates, and is therefore\r\nalbuminous or fibrinous; probably this is the first stage of the\r\nformation of fibrinous casts.\r\n\r\n[971] C. Posner, _op. cit._\r\n\r\nIn the case quoted of the woman who poisoned herself with potassic\r\nchromate, very striking changes were found in the stomach and\r\nintestines. The stomach contained above a litre of dark chocolate fluid\r\nof alkaline reaction; the mucous membrane, in the neighbourhood of the\r\ncardiac and pyloric extremities, was swollen and red in sharply defined\r\npatches; portions of the epithelial layer were detached, the rest of the\r\nmucous membrane was of a yellow-brown colour, and the whole intestine,\r\nfrom the duodenum to the sigmoid flexure, was filled with a partly\r\nbloody, partly treacly-looking fluid; the mucous membrane, throughout\r\nits entire extent, was swollen, with numerous extravasations, and in\r\nplaces there were losses of substance. Similar appearances to these have\r\nbeen found in other instances; the anomalous case recorded by Mr. Wilson\r\n(_ante_) is an exception. In this instance a pint of inky, turbid\r\nliquid, which yielded to analysis potassic bichromate, was found in the\r\nstomach; but there were no marked changes anywhere, save a slight\r\nredness of the cardiac end of the gullet. In Linstow’s two cases of\r\npoisoning by lead chromate, there were found in both fatty degeneration\r\nof the liver cells, and red points or patches of redness in the stomach\r\nand intestines. In the elder boy the changes in the duodenum were very\r\nintense, the mucous membrane was swollen and easily detached, in the\r\nupper part strongly injected with blood; in one place there was a\r\nperforation, and in several places the membrane was extremely thin. In\r\nthe younger boy the kidneys seem to have been normal, in the elder\r\ncongested and containing pus. Although it was clear that the two\r\nchildren died from lead chromate, a chemical analysis gave no result.\r\n\r\n§ 892. =Detection of the Chromates and Separation of the Salts of\r\nChromium from the Contents of the Stomach, &c.=--If in the methodical\r\nexamination of an acid liquid, which has been already filtered from any\r\nprecipitate that may have been obtained by sulphuretted hydrogen, this\r\nliquid is made alkaline (the alkali only being added in slight excess),\r\nand hydrated chromic oxide is thrown down mixed, it may be with other\r\nmetals of the second class, the precipitate may then be fused with nitre\r\nand potassic carbonate, and will yield potassic chromate, soluble in\r\nwater, and recognised by the red precipitate which it gives with silver\r\nnitrate, the yellow with lead acetate, and the green colour produced by\r\nboiling with dilute sulphuric acid and a little alcohol or sugar. If by\r\ntreating a complex liquid with ammonium hydrosulphide, sulphides of\r\nzinc, manganese, and iron are thrown down mixed with chromic oxide, the\r\nsame principles apply. If a chromate is present in the contents of the\r\nstomach, and the organic fluid is treated with hydrochloric acid and\r\npotassic chlorate, chromic chloride is formed, and dissolving imparts a\r\ngreen colour to the liquid--this in itself will be strong evidence of\r\nthe presence of a chromate, but it should be supplemented by throwing\r\ndown the oxide, and transforming it in the way detailed into potassic\r\nchromate.\r\n\r\nA general method of detecting and estimating both chromium and barium in\r\norganic matters has been worked out by L. de Koningh.[972] The\r\nsubstances are burnt to an ash in a platinum dish. The ash is weighed;\r\nto the ash is added four times its weight of potassium sodium carbonate\r\nand the same amount of potassium nitrate; and the whole is fused for\r\nfifteen minutes. The fused mass is boiled with water and filtered; if\r\nchromium is present, the filtrate is of a more or less pronounced yellow\r\ncolour, but manganese may produce a green colour and mask the yellow;\r\nthis colour is removed by boiling with a little alcohol. The liquid is\r\nconcentrated down to 20 c.c., filtered into a test-tube, and a\r\ncolorimetric estimation made of the chromium present by imitating the\r\ncolour by a solution of potassium chromate of known strength. To prove\r\nthat the colour is really due to chromium, acetic acid and lead acetate\r\nare added, when the yellow chromate of lead is at once thrown down. (If\r\nlead was in the ash, a yellow precipitate may appear on the addition of\r\nacetic acid.) To the portion of ash insoluble in water strong\r\nhydrochloric acid is added, and to the acid solution a large excess of\r\ncalcium sulphate is added; this precipitates barium as sulphate free\r\nfrom lead sulphate, for, if the latter should be present, it does not,\r\nunder the circumstances, come down, being soluble in strong hydrochloric\r\nacid.\r\n\r\n[972] _Arch. Pharm._ (3), xxvii. 944.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. THALLIUM.\r\n\r\n    § 893. Thallium was discovered by Crookes in 1861. Its atomic weight\r\n    is 204; specific gravity, 11·81 to 11·91; melting-point, 290°. It is\r\n    a heavy diamagnetic metal, very similar to lead in its physical\r\n    properties. The nitrate and sulphate of thallium are both soluble in\r\n    water, the carbonate less so, requiring about 25 parts of water for\r\n    solution, while the chloride is sparingly soluble, especially in\r\n    hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\n    § 894. =Effects.=--All the salts of thallium are poisonous. One of\r\n    the earlier experimenters on the physiological action, Paulet, found\r\n    1 grm. (15·4 grains) of thallium carbonate sufficient to kill a\r\n    rabbit in a few hours; there were loss of muscular power, trembling\r\n    of the limbs, and death apparently from asphyxia. Lamy[973] used\r\n    thallium sulphate, and found that dogs were salivated, and suffered\r\n    from trembling of the limbs, followed by paralysis. The most\r\n    definite results were obtained by Marmé,[974] who found that ·04 to\r\n    ·06 grm. of a soluble thallium salt, injected subcutaneously or\r\n    directly into the veins, and ·5 grm. administered through the\r\n    stomach of rabbits, caused death. The action is cumulative, and\r\n    something like that of mercury: there are redness and swelling of\r\n    the mucous membrane of the stomach, with mucous bloody discharges;\r\n    hæmorrhage may also occur from the lungs. Thallium is eliminated\r\n    through the urine, and is also found in the fæces; it passes into\r\n    the urine from three to five minutes after injection: the\r\n    elimination is slow, often taking as long as three weeks. It has\r\n    been found in the milk, in the tears, in the mucous membrane of the\r\n    mouth, of the trachea, in the secretion of the gastric mucous\r\n    membrane, and in the pericardial fluid; and in these places, whether\r\n    the poison has been introduced by subcutaneous injection, or by any\r\n    other channel. It seems probable that the reason of its being\r\n    detected so readily in all the secretions is the minute quantity\r\n    which can be discovered by spectroscopic analysis.\r\n\r\n[973] _Chem. News_, 1863.\r\n\r\n[974] _Göttinger Gelehrt. Nachrichten_, Aug. 14, No. 20.\r\n\r\n    § 895. =Separation of Thallium from Organic Fluids or Tissues.=--The\r\n    salts of thallium, if absorbed, would only be extracted in traces\r\n    from the tissues by hydrochloric acid, so that, in any special\r\n    search, the tissues are best destroyed by either sulphuric or nitric\r\n    acid, or both. In the ordinary method of analysis, when an acid\r\n    liquid is first treated with sulphuretted hydrogen, and then made\r\n    alkaline by ammonia and ammonic sulphide, thallium would be thrown\r\n    down with the manganese and iron of the blood. From the mixed\r\n    sulphides, thallium may be separated by oxidising and dissolving the\r\n    sulphides with nitric acid, evaporating off the excess of acid,\r\n    dissolving in a very little hot water, and precipitating thallous\r\n    chloride by solution of common salt. The ease, however, with which\r\n    thallium may be separated from solutions of its salts by galvanism\r\n    is so great as to render all other processes unnecessary: the best\r\n    way, therefore, is to obtain a deposit of the metal on platinum by a\r\n    current from one or more cells, and then to examine the deposit\r\n    spectroscopically. Thallium gives, when heated in a Bunsen flame, a\r\n    magnificent green line, the centre of which corresponds with wave\r\n    length 534·9; a second green line, the centre of which coincides\r\n    with W.L. 568, may also be distinguished.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. ALUMINIUM.\r\n\r\n§ 896. =Aluminium and its Salts.=--A strong solution of acetate of\r\nalumina has irritant properties, and has given rise to accidents. The\r\nterm alum, in a chemical sense, is given to a class of bodies of the\r\ntype of AlKSO₄. Common alum is at the present time ammonia alum,\r\nNH₄Al(SO₄)₂ + 12H₂O; when made anhydrous by heat it is known by the name\r\nof burnt alum, and possesses caustic properties.\r\n\r\n§ 897. =Action of Alum Salts.=--Death or illness has hitherto only taken\r\nplace from the ingestion of large doses of alum or the acetate, and the\r\nsymptoms in these cases have been those of an irritant poison; we are,\r\nhowever, indebted to Paul Siem[975] for a research on the absorbed\r\nsubstance, in which the local effects as far as possible have been\r\nreduced.\r\n\r\n[975] _Ueber die Wirkungen des Aluminiums u. Berylliums, Inaug. Diss._,\r\nDorpat, 1886; Schmidt’s _Jahrbuch_, vol. ccxi. 128.\r\n\r\nSiem’s research was made on frogs, cats, and dogs. For frogs he employed\r\na double salt, consisting of sodic and aluminic lactate, to which he\r\nascribed the formula Al₂(C₃H₅O₃)₃(C₃H₄NaO₃)₃, equal to 15·2 per cent. of\r\nAl₂O₃. Twenty to thirty mgrms., administered by subcutaneous injection\r\nto frogs, caused death in from ten to twenty-four hours. After the\r\ninjection there was restlessness, and, ultimately, general paralysis of\r\nthe central nervous system. The circulation was not affected; the heart\r\nwas the last to die.\r\n\r\nFor warm-blooded animals he used the double tartrate of sodium and\r\naluminium. Beginning with a small dose subcutaneously administered, he\r\ngradually increased it, and found, under these circumstances, that the\r\nlethal dose for rabbits was 0·3 grm. per kilo. of body weight; for dogs\r\n0·25 grm., and for cats 0·25 to 0·28 grm.; if, however, a single dose\r\nwas administered, then cats could be killed by 0·15 grm. per kilo. The\r\nsymptoms commenced ten to twelve hours after the injection of a large\r\ndose, but with a medium dose the symptoms might be delayed for from\r\nthree to four days, then there was loss of appetite, constipation,\r\nemaciation, languor, and a disinclination to move. Vomiting and loss of\r\nsensation to pain followed, the power of swallowing even saliva was\r\nlost, and a condition supervened similar to bulbar paralysis. However\r\ntrue this picture may be when large doses are given subcutaneously, it\r\ndoes not follow that hydrate of alumina in small doses, given by the\r\nmouth, mixed with food, produces any symptoms whatever.\r\n\r\nAlum baking-powders, containing from 30 to 40 per cent. of alum mixed\r\nwith carbonate of soda, are in commerce, and have been for a long time,\r\nmany tons being sold yearly. When water is added to such powders\r\ndecomposition takes place, the result being sodic sulphate and aluminic\r\nhydrate, carbonic acid being given off. Were the hydrate, in small\r\ndoses, capable of producing indigestion or disease of the central\r\nnervous system, it seems astonishing that, considering the enormous\r\nnumber of persons who use alum baking-powders, there should not be some\r\ndefinite evidence of its effect. The author and his family for months\r\ntogether have used alum baking-powders without any apparent injury, and\r\nthere is little doubt that alumina hydrate passes out of the system\r\nmainly by the bowel, without being absorbed to any great extent. In a\r\ntrial with regard to an alum baking-powder at Pontypridd (1893), the\r\nprosecution advanced the theory, and supported it by eminent scientific\r\nopinion, that aluminium hydrate was dissolved by the hydrochloric acid\r\nof the gastric juice, forming chloride of aluminium, some of which might\r\nbe absorbed and enter the circulation; that which was not absorbed in\r\nthe stomach passed on, and, meeting the alkaline fluids of the\r\nintestines, was again separated as aluminium hydrate, and as such\r\nabsorbed.\r\n\r\nIf this does occur, still there is no direct evidence of its toxic\r\ninfluence in the small quantities used in baking-powder. It may be\r\npointed out, also, that with regard to the possible lethal effect of a\r\nnon-corrosive salt of alum, presuming that the lethal dose for man is\r\nthe same as that for a cat, the amount of alumina to kill a\r\n68-kilogramme man would have to be equal to 17 grms., or about 3 ozs. of\r\nammonia alum. This important question can only be settled by careful\r\nfeeding of animals carried on for a long period of time.\r\n\r\n§ 898. =Post-mortem Appearances.=--In the few cases in which persons\r\nhave been killed by large doses of alum or its salts there have been\r\nfound corrosion of the mouth, throat, and stomach, and hyperæmia of the\r\nkidneys and intestine. In the animals experimented upon by Paul Siem,\r\nhyperæmia of the intestine, fatty degeneration of the liver and hyaline\r\ndegeneration of the kidneys were the chief changes noted.\r\n\r\n§ 899. =Detection of Alumina.=--In all operations for the detection of\r\nalumina, glass and porcelain vessels are to be avoided. The substances\r\nshould be burned to an ash in a platinum dish, the ash treated with\r\nhydrochloric acid, the acid driven off by heat, and a few drops of\r\nnitric acid added, and dissolved in hydrochloric acid, and the solution\r\nboiled and filtered. If organs of the body are operated upon, iron and\r\nphosphoric acid will be present in the ash; this will, indeed, be the\r\ncase with most organic substances. The filtered solution is boiled, and,\r\nwhile boiling, poured into a strong solution of sodic hydrate contained\r\nin a silver or platinum dish; the iron will now separate as oxide, and\r\ncan be filtered off. To the filtrate is added a little sodic phosphate;\r\nit is then feebly acidified with hydrochloric acid, and ammonia added\r\njust sufficient to render it alkaline; a light whitish cloud of alumina\r\nphosphate, should alumina be present, is thrown down, and can be\r\ncollected, thoroughly washed, dried, ignited, and weighed as alumina\r\nphosphate.[976] The alumina phosphate is then fused with sodic sulphate\r\nin a platinum dish or crucible, and the fused mass treated with hot\r\nwater; the sodic phosphate dissolves, and the alumina oxide may be\r\nfiltered off and dissolved in a little hydrochloric acid or sulphuric\r\nacid.\r\n\r\n[976] One part of al. phosphate is equal to 0·42 Al₂O₃, 3·733 ammonia\r\nalum, and 4·481 potash alum.\r\n\r\nA solution thus prepared has the following properties:--\r\n\r\nAmmonium sulphide; white precipitate of hydroxide.\r\n\r\nPotash or soda; white precipitate, soluble in excess.\r\n\r\nAmmonia; white precipitate, only slightly soluble in excess.\r\n\r\nThere is also a blowpipe-test: if a little of the hydroxide be\r\ncollected, moistened with cobalt nitrate, and heated on charcoal by the\r\noxidising flame, alumina, under these circumstances, becomes of a blue\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. URANIUM.\r\n\r\n    § 900. =Uranium.=--The salts of uranium are intensely poisonous. The\r\n    nitrate of uranium is used in photography and the arts, and is a\r\n    common reagent in chemical laboratories.\r\n\r\n    According to Kowalewsky,[977] the acetate of uranium possesses an\r\n    unusual power of uniting with albumin; the other soluble uranium\r\n    salts act also in a similar way. Hence concentrated solutions of\r\n    uranium salts corrode the mucous membranes, transforming, for\r\n    example, the walls of the stomach into a dead uranic albuminate. If\r\n    a non-corrosive salt of uranium is injected subcutaneously,\r\n    glycosuria is produced, with fatty degeneration of the walls of the\r\n    blood-vessels, and fatty changes in the kidneys, liver, &c. The\r\n    animal wastes and ultimately dies; 0·5 to 2·0 mgrms. of UO₃ per\r\n    kilogrm. will kill a cat, dog, or rabbit, if injected\r\n    subcutaneously. The nitrate or acetate, when given by the mouth,\r\n    produces gastro-enteritis and nephritis, with hæmorrhages in the\r\n    substance of the kidney. Uranium is not used in medicine.\r\n\r\n[977] _Ztschr. f. Anal. Chemie_, xxiv., 1885, p. 551.\r\n\r\n    § 901. =Detection and Estimation of Uranium.=--Uranium forms uranous\r\n    and uranic salts. Both classes of salts are not precipitated by SH₂,\r\n    but are precipitable by ammonium sulphide, and, therefore, in\r\n    toxicological analyses are likely to be met with in conjunction with\r\n    iron.\r\n\r\n    The sulphides of iron and uranium may be dissolved in strong\r\n    hydrochloric acid, boiled to expel SH₂, and the solution then\r\n    oxidised with a little nitric acid; the solution is now alkalised\r\n    with ammonium carbonate, which precipitates the iron as oxide and\r\n    leaves the uranium in solution. On now acidifying with nitric acid\r\n    in slight excess, a solution of sodic phosphate will precipitate\r\n    uranium phosphate as a white precipitate, alkalies will give a\r\n    yellow precipitate, alkaline carbonates a yellow precipitate soluble\r\n    in excess. Barium carbonate also gives a precipitate, and is useful\r\n    in separations. Uranium oxide gives a green glass in the oxidising\r\n    flame with borax or with sodic metaphosphate.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.--ALKALINE EARTHS.\r\n\r\nBarium.\r\n\r\n§ 902. The soluble salts of barium are undoubtedly poisonous, and are of\r\nfrequent occurrence in the arts. The chloride of barium is used in the\r\nstaining of wool, the nitrate and the chlorate in the green fires of the\r\npyrotechnist, the oxide and the carbonate in the manufacture of glass.\r\nThe chromate is used by artists under the name of “yellow ultramarine,”\r\nwhile the sulphate, technically known as “permanent white,” is, on\r\naccount of its weight and cheapness, occasionally used as an adulterant\r\nof white powders and other substances. Barium sulphide, under various\r\nnames, such as Bottcher’s depilatory, Thompson’s hair destroyer, _Poudre\r\népilatoire_, and other names, is in commerce, and has caused poisonous\r\nsymptoms.[978]\r\n\r\n[978] Barium carbonate and sulphate are usually enumerated as occasional\r\nadulterants of bread, but there is no modern authentic instance of this.\r\n\r\n§ 903. =Chloride of Barium=, BaCl₂2H₂O 208 + 36; anhydrous, Ba, 65·86\r\nper cent., Cl, 34·14; specific gravity, 3·75, is in commerce in the form\r\nof white, four-sided, tabular crystals; water dissolves about half its\r\nweight at ordinary temperatures, three-fourths at 100°. Its solution\r\ngives a white precipitate with sulphuric acid, quite insoluble in water\r\nand nitric acid.\r\n\r\nThe salt imparts a green hue to an otherwise colourless flame; viewed by\r\nthe spectroscope, green bands will be visible. We may note that chloride\r\nof barium gives two different spectra--the one at the moment of the\r\nintroduction of the salt, the other when the substance has been exposed\r\nfor some time to a high temperature. This is caused by a rapid loss of\r\nchlorine, so that the first spectrum is due to BaCl₂, with a variable\r\nmixture of BaCl, the second to BaCl alone.\r\n\r\n§ 904. =Baric Carbonate=, BaCO₃ = 197; specific gravity, 4·3; BaO, 77·69\r\nper cent., CO₂, 22·31, in its native form termed _Witherite_, is a\r\ndense, heavy powder, insoluble in pure water, but dissolving in acetic,\r\nnitric, and hydrochloric acids, the solution giving the reactions of\r\nbarium.\r\n\r\nA rat-poison may be met with composed of baric carbonate, sugar, and\r\noatmeal, flavoured with a little oil of aniseed and caraway.\r\n\r\n§ 905. =Sulphate of Barium=, BaSO₄; specific gravity, 4·59; BaO, 65·66\r\nper cent., SO₃, 34·34 per cent., is a pure white powder when recently\r\nprecipitated, absolutely insoluble in water, and practically insoluble\r\nin cold dilute acids. It is quite unalterable in the air at a red heat;\r\non ignition with charcoal, it may be converted almost entirely into\r\nsulphide of barium; and by ignition with CaCl₂ into chloride.\r\n\r\n§ 906. =Effects of the Soluble Salts of Barium on Animals.=--One of the\r\nearly notices of the poisonous characters of barium compounds was by\r\nJames Watt,[979] who found that _witherite_, given to dogs, produced\r\nvomiting, diarrhœa, and death in a few hours. Sir Benj. Brodie[980]\r\nadministered barium chloride, and noticed its paralysing effect on the\r\nheart. Orfila[981] made several experiments, and observed that 4 grms.\r\nof the carbonate produced death in dogs in periods varying from one to\r\nfive hours; but in these experiments the gullet was tied. The later\r\ninvestigators have been Gmelin, Onsum, Cyon, and Böhm.[982] Gmelin\r\nfound barium carbonate and barium chloride act in a very similar manner;\r\nand, indeed, it is improbable that barium carbonate, _as_ carbonate, has\r\nany action, but, when swallowed, the hydrochloric and other acids of the\r\nstomach form with it soluble compounds. J. Onsum made eight experiments\r\nwith both barium carbonate and chloride on animals. The respiration was\r\nquickened and, at the same time, made weak and shallow; the heart’s\r\naction was accelerated; the animals became restless: and there was great\r\nmuscular prostration, with paralytic symptoms; convulsions did not occur\r\nin any one of the eight animals. He found, on _post-mortem_ examination,\r\nthe right side of the heart full of blood from backward engorgement; he\r\ndescribes a plugging of the small arteries with little fibrinous\r\ncoagula, having an inorganic nucleus, with constant hæmorrhagic\r\nextravasations. Onsum seems to have held the theory that the baryta\r\nsalts circulated in the blood, and then formed insoluble compounds,\r\nwhich were arrested in the lungs, causing minute emboli, just in the\r\nsame way as if a finely-divided solid were introduced directly into the\r\ncirculation by the jugular vein.\r\n\r\n[979] _Memoirs of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester_,\r\n1790, vol. iii. p. 609.\r\n\r\n[980] _Phil. Trans._, 1812.\r\n\r\n[981] _Traité des Poisons_, 3rd ed., t. i., Paris, 1826.\r\n\r\n[982] Gmelin, C. G., _Versuche über die Wirkungen des Baryts,\r\nStrontians, Chroms, Molybdäns, Wolframs, Tellurs, u. s. w. auf den\r\nthierischen Organismus_, Tübingen, 1824; Onsum, J., Virchow’s _Archiv_,\r\nBd. 2, 1863; Cyon, M., _Archiv f. Anatomie, Physiologie, &c._, 1866;\r\nBöhm, _Archiv f. experiment. Pathol._, Bd. 3, 1874.\r\n\r\nOnsum stands alone in this view. Cyon found no emboli in the lungs, and\r\nrefers the toxic effect to a paralysing influence on the heart and\r\nvoluntary muscles, and also on the spinal cord. Cyon, to settle the\r\nembolic theory, injected into the one jugular vein of a rabbit barium\r\nchloride, and into the other sodic sulphate, but the small arteries and\r\ncapillaries of the lungs remained clear. Böhm, operating on frogs, found\r\na great similarity between the action of small doses of barium salts and\r\nthat of certain organic poisons; as, for example, cicutoxin, ·012 to ·02\r\ngrm. subcutaneously injected into frogs, acted as a heart-poison. So\r\nalso Blake[983] found the heart slowed, and concluded that barium\r\nchloride had a direct action on the cardiac muscle, and also a toxic\r\ninfluence on the nervous system. F. A. Falck, in experiments on rabbits,\r\nfound a great reduction of temperature after poisoning with barium\r\nchloride (3° to 12·6°).\r\n\r\n[983] _Journ. of Anat. and Physiol._ 2nd series, 1874.\r\n\r\n§ 907. =Effects of the Salts of Barium on Man.=--There were about\r\nfifteen cases of poisoning by barium salts on record by the end of\r\n1883--three of which were suicidal, but most of them were due to\r\naccident or mistake. In three cases, barium chloride was taken instead\r\nof Glauber’s salts; in one, instead of Carlsbad salts; in another, a\r\nmixture of barium nitrate and sulphur, instead of pure sulphur; in a\r\nsixth case, a mixture of barium acetate and raspberry syrup, instead of\r\nsodic ethylsulphate; in a seventh, a chemist put a larger dose than was\r\nordered by the prescription; and in four cases barium carbonate had been\r\nmixed with flour, and this flour used in the making of pastry. Of the\r\nfifteen cases, nine, or 60 per cent., proved fatal; the fifteen cases\r\nhave now (1894) been increased to twenty-six.\r\n\r\n=Fatal Dose.=--The recorded cases of poisoning have not satisfactorily\r\nsettled the question as to the least fatal dose of the barium salts. 6·5\r\ngrms. (about 100 grains) of the chloride have destroyed the life of an\r\nadult woman in fifteen hours; 14 grms. (½ oz.) of the nitrate of baryta\r\nhave killed a man in six and a half hours; and the carbonate of baryta\r\nhas destroyed a person in the relatively small dose of 3·8 grms. (60\r\ngrains). On the other hand, certain Continental physicians have\r\nprescribed barium chloride in large medicinal doses; for example,\r\nPirondi[984] and Lisfranc[985] have gradually raised the dose of barium\r\nchloride from 4 decigrams up to 3 grms. (48 grains) daily, given, of\r\ncourse, in divided doses. Pirondi himself took in a day 7·7 grms. (119\r\ngrains) without bad effect.\r\n\r\n[984] _De la Tumeur Blanche de Genou_, éd. 2, Paris, 1836.\r\n\r\n[985] _Gaz. Med. de Paris_, 1835, No. 14.\r\n\r\n§ 908. =Symptoms.=--The local action of barium salts must be sharply\r\ndistinguished from the action of the absorbed salts. Kobert divides the\r\nsymptoms into seven groups:--\r\n\r\n(1) Local, consisting in _malaise_, nausea, salivation, vomiting, and\r\npain in the stomach. This group merges so much into the next as hardly\r\nto admit of precise separation.\r\n\r\n(2) Excitation of the alimentary canal, both of the nervous and muscular\r\napparatus. Hence vomiting, painful colic, and acute diarrhœa. All these\r\nphenomena may be produced in animals by subcutaneous injection, and,\r\ntherefore, do not depend alone upon local action.\r\n\r\n(3) Excitation of the brain motor centres, which leads to convulsions,\r\nor may result in paralysis. About half the recorded cases of barium\r\npoisoning in the human subject have been convulsed; the other half\r\nparalysed. In one case mania resulted.\r\n\r\n(4) Weakness or destruction of the power of muscular contraction; this\r\nproduces in frogs, when the muscular test movements are recorded\r\ngraphically, a veratrin-like convulsion curve. In the human subject the\r\neffect is that of great muscular weakness.\r\n\r\n(5) Digitalin-like influence on the heart and blood-vessels, showing\r\nitself in great slowing of the pulse, præcordial anxiety, and strong\r\nbeating of the heart (not only sensible to the patient, but which can be\r\nheard and felt by the bystanders). The arteries are incompressible and\r\nrigid, the blood-pressure strikingly raised. The blood-vessels of old\r\npeople do not stand the pressure, hence hæmorrhages in the lungs,\r\nstomach, and other organs. Frogs die with the heart in systole.\r\n\r\n(6) Catarrhal affection of the conjunctiva, the mucous membrane of the\r\nrespiratory tract, and the nose.\r\n\r\n(7) Formation of insoluble baryta salts in the blood-vessels, according\r\nto Onsum. This has not been observed in man, and the fact is disputed\r\n(see _ante_).\r\n\r\nIn Dr. Tidy’s case,[986] in which a man, suffering from rheumatism, but\r\notherwise healthy, took a mixture of barium nitrate, flowers of sulphur,\r\nand potassic chlorate, instead of sulphur, the symptoms were blisters on\r\nthe tongue, a burning pain in the gullet and stomach, with vomiting,\r\ndiarrhœa, convulsions, aphonia, and coldness of the extremities. A case,\r\ncopiously detailed by Seidel,[987] in which a pregnant woman,\r\ntwenty-eight years old, took carbonate of baryta for the purpose of\r\nself-destruction, is interesting. She probably took the poison some\r\nlittle time before six in the evening; she vomited and had great pain in\r\nthe stomach, but slept during the night without further sickness. The\r\nnext morning, after drinking some coffee, the sickness was renewed;\r\nnevertheless, at 7 A.M., she repaired to her employment, which was\r\ndistant an hour’s walk; she probably suffered much on the way, for she\r\ndid not arrive until 9 A.M. The vomiting, accompanied by diarrhœa,\r\ncontinuing, she was sent to bed at 2 P.M. She was very cold, and\r\ncomplained of great weakness; the vomiting now ceased. At 8 P.M. she\r\nshivered violently, could scarcely swallow, and the respiration was\r\noppressed. At 11 she seemed a little improved; but at 3 A.M. she was\r\nfound much worse, breathing rapidly, but fully conscious; at 4 A.M. she\r\nwas again seen, but found dead; she thus lived about thirty-four hours\r\nafter taking the fatal dose.\r\n\r\n[986] _Pharm. Journ._, June 1868.\r\n\r\n[987] Eulenberg’s _Vierteljahrsschrift f. ger. Med._, Bd. 27, § 213.\r\n\r\n§ 909. =Distribution of Barium in the Body.=--Neumann has shown that,\r\nafter repeated injection of insoluble barium sulphate into the veins of\r\nrabbits, barium is to be found in the liver, kidneys, spleen, and spinal\r\ncord, but not in the muscles, thymus, or brain. G. Linossier[988] has\r\nmade a similar series of experiments, but with the more soluble\r\ncarbonate, and this salt was injected into animals for a period of\r\nthirty days. All the organs contained some barium; lungs, muscles, and\r\nthe heart only contained traces, the liver rather more, the kidneys,\r\nbrain, and spinal cord still more, and, lastly, the bones a considerable\r\nquantity, as much as 0·056 per cent.\r\n\r\n[988] _Compt. rend. Soc. Biol._ (8), iv. 122-123.\r\n\r\n§ 910. =Post-mortem Appearances.=--The _post-mortem_ appearances are\r\nusually changes in the stomach and intestinal tract, but there are only\r\nrarely traces of great inflammation. It is true, that in a case recorded\r\nby Wach,[989] perforation of the stomach was found; but, since there was\r\nold-standing disease of both liver and stomach, it is not clear that\r\nthis is to be attributed entirely to poison. In the case of suicide just\r\ndetailed, the mucous membrane of the stomach was much ecchymosed; over\r\nthe whole were strewn little white grains, sticking to the mucous\r\nmembrane, and there were also ecchymoses in the duodenum.\r\n\r\n[989] Henke’s _Zeitschrift f. Staatsarzneik._, 1835, Bd. 30, Hft. 1, §\r\n1.\r\n\r\n§ 911. =The Separation of Barium Salts from Organic Solids or Fluids,\r\nand their Identification.=--In the usual course of examination of an\r\nunknown substance, the matter will already have been extracted by\r\nhydrochloric acid, and the solution successively treated with hydric and\r\nammonic sulphides. The filtrate from any precipitate, after being\r\nboiled, would in such a case give a precipitate if treated with\r\nsulphuric acid, should a salt of barium soluble in hydrochloric acid be\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nIf there, however, should be _special_ grounds to search for baryta in\r\nparticular, it is best to extract the substances with pure boiling\r\nwater, to concentrate the solution, and then add sulphuric acid,\r\ncollecting any precipitate which may form. If the latter is found to be\r\nsulphate of baryta, it must be derived from some soluble salt, such as\r\nthe nitrate or the chloride. The substances which have been exhausted\r\nwith water are now treated with hydrochloric acid, and to the acid\r\nfiltrate sulphuric acid is added. If sulphate of baryta is thrown down,\r\nthe baryta present must have been a salt, insoluble in water, soluble in\r\nacids--probably the carbonate. Lastly, the organic substances may be\r\nburnt to an ash, the ash fused with carbonate of soda, the mass, when\r\ncool, dissolved in HCl, and the solution precipitated with sulphuric\r\nacid. Any baryta now obtained was present, probably in the form of\r\nsulphate; nevertheless, if obtained from the tissues, it would prove\r\nthat a soluble salt had been administered, for (so far as is known)\r\nsulphate of barium is not taken up by the animal fluids, and is\r\ninnocuous.\r\n\r\nThe sulphate of barium is identified as follows:--\r\n\r\n(1) A part of the well-washed precipitate is boiled with distilled\r\nwater, filtered, and to the filtrate a solution of chloride of barium\r\nadded. If there is no precipitate, the sulphate can be none other than\r\nbaric sulphate, for all the rest, without exception, are soluble enough\r\nto give a slight cloud with baric chloride.\r\n\r\n(2) The sulphate may be changed into sulphide by ignition on charcoal,\r\nthe sulphide treated with HCl, the solution evaporated to dryness, and\r\nthe resulting chloride examined spectroscopically; or, the sulphide may\r\nbe mixed with chloride of calcium, taken up on a loop of platinum wire,\r\nheated strongly in the flame of a Bunsen burner, and the flame examined\r\nby the spectroscope.\r\n\r\n(3) A solution of the chloride of barium obtained from (2) gives a\r\nyellow precipitate with neutral chromate of potash, insoluble in water,\r\nbut soluble in nitric acid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nTreatment by Antidotes or otherwise of Cases of Poisoning.\r\n\r\n§ 912.

In such emergencies not a moment is to be lost, for\r\nvaluable lives have ere this been sacrificed simply from the delay\r\ncaused by searching for medicines and instruments, and visiting the\r\npatient unprovided with suitable remedies. Hence it is far the safest\r\nplan for every medical man to provide himself with an “_antidote bag_,”\r\nwhich, to be complete, should be furnished with the following\r\nrequisites:--\r\n\r\n\r\nI. INSTRUMENTS:--\r\n\r\n(1.) A =stomach-pump= or =tube=,[990] with proper mouth gags.\r\n\r\n[990] The stomach-tube is simply a tube of india-rubber, from 6 to 8\r\nfeet in length, one end of which should be a little stiff, and\r\nhave a solid rounded extremity pierced with two lateral oval\r\nholes--catheter-like; but, on an emergency, any india-rubber tube of a\r\nsuitable length will do. It is used by passing the proper end gently\r\ndown the throat into the stomach; if the patient is insensible, or, as\r\nin some determined suicides, obstinate, the jaws must be forcibly opened\r\nby the handle of a spoon, and some solid substance placed between the\r\nteeth so as to give sufficient room for the entry of the tube. If the\r\ntube is now passed in the median line well into the grasp of the\r\npharynx, it is actually drawn down into the stomach by the pharyngeal\r\nmuscles, so that the operator has, as it were, only to “pay out” a\r\nsufficient quantity of the tubing. Holding the tube in a perpendicular\r\nposition, it may then be filled with water by means of a small funnel.\r\nWhen full, the end must be pinched and brought down to the ground to\r\ndeliver in a basin; it will then act as a syphon and the contents of the\r\nstomach will be syphoned off. The tube is elevated again above the body,\r\nand the stomach filled with water; this syphoned off, and the process\r\nrepeated. Coffee, also, or antidotes may be conveniently introduced. If\r\nthe recumbent position is necessary, the patient must, of course, be\r\nplaced on a bed or table, in order that there should be sufficient fall\r\nfor the syphon.\r\n\r\n(2.) A =hypodermic syringe=.\r\n\r\n(3.) An ordinary bleeding =lancet=.\r\n\r\n(4.) A =glass-syringe= with suitable canula, which may, in case of\r\nnecessity, be used for transfusion.\r\n\r\n(5.) =Bistoury=, =forceps= and =tubes= suitable for performing\r\n=tracheotomy=.\r\n\r\nA small =battery= (interrupted current).\r\n\r\n\r\nII. EMETICS:--\r\n\r\n(1.) _Sulphate of zinc._\r\n\r\n(2.) _Apomorphine._\r\n\r\n(3.) _Mustard._\r\n\r\n(4.) _Ipecacuanha._\r\n\r\nThe _sulphate of zinc_ may either be carried in 30-grain powders or in\r\nthe ordinary solid crystalline state, together with a little measure\r\nmade out of a small pill-box which, when exactly full, is found to\r\ncontain from 25 to 30 grains.\r\n\r\nA still more convenient form is that of the compressed tablets, sold as\r\na speciality by one or more firms. The same remarks apply to\r\n_ipecacuanha._\r\n\r\nThe _apomorphine hydrochlorate_ should be in solution, a suitable\r\nstrength is 2 per cent.; a few drops of this substance, injected\r\nhypodermically, will cause vomiting in a few minutes.\r\n\r\nBesides the above list, the bag should be furnished with a selection of\r\nthe so-called antidotes.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. ANTIDOTES:--\r\n\r\n(_a._) _Chemicals neutralising the poison._\r\n\r\n=Acetic acid= and =calcined magnesia=.\r\n\r\n(_b._) _Precipitants of alkaloids._\r\n\r\n=Tannin=--A solution of =iodine in potassic iodide=.\r\n\r\n(_c._) _Narcotics, or anæsthetics,_ for the treatment of the tetanic\r\nclass.\r\n\r\n=Chloral=--chloroform.\r\n\r\n(_d._) _Substances which act physiologically._\r\n\r\n=French oil of turpentine.=--A solution of =atropine sulphate= for\r\nhypodermic use (strength ·8 per cent.); hypodermic dose from 5 to 6\r\ndrops.\r\n\r\nSolution of =nitrate of pilocarpine= (strength 5 per cent.); dose, 10\r\ndrops or more.\r\n\r\n=Muscarine=--a solution in water (strength 5 per cent.); dose, 10 drops.\r\n\r\n=Morphine meconate= in solution (strength 10 per cent.); dose, from 5\r\ndrops.\r\n\r\nA solution of =nitrate of strychnine= (strength 2 per cent.); hypodermic\r\ndose, from 2 to 3 drops.\r\n\r\n=Potassium Permanganate= in crystals.\r\n\r\nTo these may be added a bottle of =Wyeth’s dialysed iron= for use in\r\narsenic poisoning, a flask of =brandy=, some =chloric ether=, =aromatic\r\nspirits of ammonia=, and some really good =extract of coffee=.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.\r\n\r\n§ 913. ACID CARBOLIC.\r\n\r\nUse the =stomach-tube= or =pump=, unless there is great destruction of\r\nthe mucous membrane. In the latter case, excite vomiting by injecting\r\nsubcutaneously from 5 to 6 drops of the =apomorphine= solution; or give\r\nan emetic of =zinc sulphate=, =ipecacuanha=, or =mustard=.\r\n\r\nThe stomach may, by the aid of the tube, be washed out with a weak\r\nalkaline solution of =soda=; =albumen= may also be given, and such\r\nstimulants as =brandy= and =water=, =chloric ether=, and =aromatic\r\nspirits of ammonia=.\r\n\r\nIt is important to apply warmth to the extremities.\r\n\r\nInject subcutaneously from 2 to 3 drops of the =atropine hypodermic=\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\n=Nitrite of amyl= by inhalation is said to have been useful.\r\n\r\nIn desperate cases =bleeding=, followed by =transfusion=, is to be\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\n\r\nACIDS--MINERAL, including SULPHURIC, NITRIC, HYDROCHLORIC, GLACIAL\r\nACETIC ACIDS.\r\n\r\n=Stomach-tube= or =pump=, inadmissible.\r\n\r\nNeutralise by calcined =magnesia=, =lime=, =chalk=, or =soda,= but not\r\nwith potash, if there is choice.\r\n\r\nIf no neutralising agent can be immediately procured, then dilute with\r\nplenty of water.\r\n\r\nOther remedies are--=oil=, =milk=, =white of eggs=, =gruel=.\r\n\r\nIt is often recommended in such cases to administer hypodermically a\r\nlittle =morphine=.\r\n\r\n\r\nACONITE--ACONITINE.\r\n\r\nUse at once the =stomach-tube= or =pump=, or give emetics of =sulphate\r\nof zinc=, or hypodermic solution of =apomorphine=.\r\n\r\nKeep the patient in the recumbent posture.\r\n\r\nAfter the stomach has been emptied, give =atropine=, either by\r\nhypodermic injection or by the mouth, say 4 drops of the P.B. solution;\r\nfailing atropine, 20 drops of the tincture of =belladonna=. The dose may\r\nbe repeated more or less frequently according to the condition of the\r\npatient.\r\n\r\nIf there is great tendency to heart-syncope, tincture of =digitalis= in\r\n½-drachm doses by the mouth, or in hypodermic doses of from 10 drops\r\nupwards.\r\n\r\nApply a mustard poultice to the pericardium; aid vomiting and\r\nelimination of the poison by plenty of water, to which may be added\r\nbrandy or any form of alcohol.\r\n\r\nInhalations of =nitrite of amyl= are said to have been useful. If the\r\nbreathing stops, try =artificial respiration=.\r\n\r\n\r\nALCOHOL.\r\n\r\nEmpty the stomach by the =tube= or =pump=, and then wash it out with\r\nwarm coffee; if the stomach-tube is not at hand, then empty the stomach\r\nby hypodermic injection of 5 drops of =apomorphine=, or by a =mustard=\r\nemetic, or =sulphate of zinc=. Keep the body very warm, but the cold\r\n=douche= may be applied to the head.\r\n\r\nEndeavours should be made to rouse the patient, if insensible, by\r\nshaking, shouting at him, &c.\r\n\r\nInhalations of =amyl nitrite= are said to be useful.\r\n\r\n\r\nALKALIES--AMMONIA--POTASH--SODA.--=Stomach-pump= or =tube= not to be\r\nused.\r\n\r\nVomiting nearly always present, or may be produced by administering\r\nplenty of lukewarm water; after which give =dilute vinegar=, or the\r\njuice of =lemons= or =oranges=; =olive oil=, the =white of eggs=,\r\n=barley water=, =arrowroot=,= and always plenty of =water= may be\r\nadministered.\r\n\r\nThere may be œdema of the glottis, especially if ammonia has been taken.\r\nIn such a case, and death threatening from suffocation, perform\r\n=tracheotomy=. In poisoning by ammonia, with croupous respiration, keep\r\nthe room warm, and fill it with steam by means of a bronchitis kettle.\r\n\r\nRelieve pain by small doses of =morphine= injected subcutaneously.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMMONIA.--See ALKALIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nANTIARIN.--See DIGITALIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nANTIMONY--TARTAR-EMETIC--ANTIMONIAL WINE, &C.\r\n\r\nThe stomach will generally have been emptied by vomiting. In those rare\r\ncases in which this does not take place, use the =stomach-pump= or\r\n=tube=, or give hypodermic injection of =apomorphine=.\r\n\r\nFollow this with doses of =strong tea=, or give half-a-drachm of\r\n=tannin= or =gallic acid= in warm water.\r\n\r\nGive also demulcent drinks, and stimulants in small doses, frequently\r\nrepeated.\r\n\r\nKeep the patient very warm by hot blankets and wraps.\r\n\r\nThe interrupted galvanic current to the heart may be useful.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPOCYNIN.--See DIGITALIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nARSENIC.\r\n\r\nUse the =stomach-pump= or =tube=, or empty stomach by emetics, such as\r\nhypodermic solution of =apomorphine=, or give =mustard= or =sulphate of\r\nzinc=. The stomach should then be washed out by large quantities of\r\nwater, most conveniently administered by the pump or tube.\r\n\r\nIf the tube or pump is not at hand, then administer at once either\r\n=dialysed iron=, or the freshly-precipitated =hydrated oxide of iron=,\r\nobtained by precipitating the ordinary perchloride by means of carbonate\r\nof soda or ammonia, avoiding excess of the latter. If the operator has\r\nsufficient chemical knowledge to precipitate the iron with fair\r\nexactness, so that there is no great excess of ammonia, or of sodic\r\ncarbonate, then filtration is unnecessary. In other cases, filter\r\nthrough a handkerchief.\r\n\r\n=Oil=, =mucilaginous drinks=, the =white of eggs=, and, if faintness\r\nexists, small doses of =stimulants= may all be given.\r\n\r\nIf the skin is cold, warmth must be applied to the body by means of hot\r\nblankets, &c.\r\n\r\nPain may be relieved by =morphine=.\r\n\r\n\r\nATROPINE--BELLADONNA--TINCTURE OF BELLADONNA.\r\n\r\nEmpty the stomach by means of the =stomach-pump= or =tube=.\r\n\r\nGive an enema of =coffee=.\r\n\r\nAdminister half a grain of =pilocarpine nitrate=; or, if that is not at\r\nhand, =morphine= or =opium= in suitable doses will act to a certain\r\nextent antagonistic to the poison.\r\n\r\nA subcutaneous dose of =muscarine= may be administered instead of\r\npilocarpine, but is not quite so good.\r\n\r\nHot water to the feet, alternate =douches= of cold and hot water are\r\nfound useful.\r\n\r\nIf the respiration seems likely to stop, =artificial respiration= must\r\nbe practised.\r\n\r\n\r\nBELLADONNA.--See ATROPINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nBENZENE.\r\n\r\nIf swallowed, then empty the stomach by =pump= or =tube=, or by the\r\nhypodermic injection of =apomorphine=; or give emetics, such as =zinc\r\nsulphate=, =mustard=, or =ipecacuanha=.\r\n\r\nIf the vapour has been _inhaled_, this is unnecessary.\r\n\r\nPlenty of =fresh air=.\r\n\r\nA subcutaneous dose of =atropine=, say 1-60th of a grain, or from 30 to\r\n40 drops of =belladonna= tincture.\r\n\r\nAlternate =douches= of hot and cold water to the chest, =artificial\r\nrespiration=, if necessary. The heart to be maintained by mild\r\ninterrupted shocks of the =battery= over the region of the heart.\r\n\r\n\r\nBICHROMATE OF POTASH.--See CHROMIUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRUCINE.--See STRYCHNINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nCALABAR BEAN--PHYSOSTIGMINE.\r\n\r\nUse =stomach-pump= or =tube=, or emetics, such as =sulphate of zinc=,\r\n=mustard=, or =ipecacuanha=; or, better still, hypodermic solution of\r\n=apomorphine=.\r\n\r\nGive hypodermic doses of 1-60th grain =atropine= until the pupils\r\ndilate. This treatment seeming to fail, =chloral= in 10-grain doses,\r\nevery quarter of an hour, has been recommended.\r\n\r\nIn certain cases =strychnine= has been used in hypodermic doses of\r\n1-12th of a grain.\r\n\r\n=Stimulants= and =artificial respiration= will probably be necessary in\r\nsome cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMPHOR.\r\n\r\nUse =stomach-pump= or =tube=, or empty the stomach by emetics.\r\n\r\nHypodermic injections of =brandy=, inhalations of =ether=, the alternate\r\nhot and cold =douche=, warmth to the extremities by hot blankets, &c.,\r\nseem to be the best methods of treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\nCANTHARIDES--CANTHARIDINE.\r\n\r\nUse =stomach-pump= or =tube=, if the mucous membrane of the throat is\r\nnot inflamed; or, administer hypodermic dose of =apomorphine=, or give\r\nemetics--=sulphate of zinc, mustard,= or =ipecacuanha=.\r\n\r\nAllay pain with =morphine=. Give plenty of water and =demulcent drinks=.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHLORAL.\r\n\r\nUse =stomach-pump= or =tube=, and, when the stomach is emptied,\r\nintroduce by the same means =warm coffee=, or give a hypodermic\r\ninjection of =apomorphine=, or administer emetics of =sulphate of zinc=,\r\nor =mustard=, or =ipecacuanha.=\r\n\r\nAn =enema of coffee= will be useful.\r\n\r\nKeep the limbs warm.\r\n\r\nAdminister hypodermically 2 or 3 drops of the solution of =strychnine=\r\nat intervals of from fifteen to twenty minutes.\r\n\r\nRouse the patient by various means, such as shouting, shaking, flapping\r\nthe skin with a wet towel, &c.\r\n\r\nInhalations of =amyl nitrite= are recommended.\r\n\r\n=Artificial respiration= may be necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHLORATE OF POTASH.\r\n\r\nUse the same treatment as for =nitrate of potash= (_which see_, p.\r\n696).\r\n\r\n\r\nCHLORIDE OF ZINC.--See ZINC.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHLOROFORM--(_Inhaled_).\r\n\r\nGive plenty of =fresh air=, pull the tongue forward, and commence at\r\nonce =artificial respiration=. If the heart has stopped, strike the\r\nchest two or three times very hard, over the region of the heart; this\r\nhas been found occasionally to restore its beat. Apply the =battery=,\r\nbut with a weak current only; one pole may be placed on the larynx, the\r\nother at the pit of the stomach.\r\n\r\nInhalations of =nitrite of amyl= are useful. The hot and cold =douche=\r\nmay also be used.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHLOROFORM--(_Swallowed_).\r\n\r\nEmpty the stomach by =pump= or =tube=, or by emetics, such as 5 drops of\r\nthe hypodermic solution of =apomorphine=, or =sulphate of zinc=, or\r\n=mustard=.\r\n\r\nGive an enema of =hot coffee=.\r\n\r\nAdminister large draughts of =water=, which may advantageously contain a\r\nlittle =sodic carbonate= in solution.\r\n\r\nAttempt to rouse the patient. =Nitrite of amyl= inhalations, and, if\r\nnecessary, =artificial respiration= may be used.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHROMATE OF POTASH.--See CHROMIUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHROMIC ACID.--See CHROMIUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHROMIUM--BICHROMATE OF POTASH--CHROMATE OF POTASH--CHROMIC ACID.\r\n\r\nEmpty the stomach by =pump= or =tube=; administer a subcutaneous\r\ninjection of =apomorphine=, or give =sulphate of zinc=, =mustard=, or\r\n=ipecacuanha= as emetics. Follow up by administering, suspended in\r\nwater, calcined magnesia, or carbonate of magnesia, or chalk.\r\n\r\n=Demulcent drinks=, such as =barley-water=, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOCCULUS INDICUS.--See PICROTOXIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLCHICUM--MEADOW SAFFRON--COLCHICUM WINE, TINCTURE, &C.\r\n\r\nUse =stomach-pump= or =tube=, or empty the stomach by emetics, such as\r\n=sulphate of zinc=, or =mustard=, or =ipecacuanha=; or, better than all,\r\ngive a hypodermic injection of 4 or 5 drops of the solution of\r\n=apomorphine=.\r\n\r\nGive =tannin= or =gallic acid= in ½-drachm doses, or strong tea or\r\ncoffee.\r\n\r\nAllay the pain in the bowels and purging by small doses of =opium= or\r\n=morphine=.\r\n\r\nKeep the extremities warm, apply hot fomentations to the abdomen;\r\n=stimulants= may be used, give plenty of =water= and =demulcent\r\ndrinks=.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLOCYNTH.\r\n\r\nTreatment on the same lines as that for COLCHICUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONIUM--HEMLOCK.\r\n\r\nEmpty the =stomach= by the =pump= or =tube=, or give a hypodermic\r\ninjection of 4 or 5 drops of the solution of =apomorphine=, or emetics\r\nof =sulphate of zinc=, or =mustard=.\r\n\r\nKeep up the temperature of the body by hot wraps.\r\n\r\nAdminister, as a drink, strong =tea=, =tannin=, =gallic acids=, or any\r\nharmless vegetable decoction containing tannin.\r\n\r\n=Stimulants= may be administered.\r\n\r\nIf necessary, use =artificial respiration=.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOPPER--SALTS OF.\r\n\r\nEmpty stomach by =pump= or =tube=, and either inject by the same means\r\nor administer =white of egg= in solution in water; if no white of eggs\r\ncan be had, substitute milk; give plenty of =water= and =emollient\r\ndrinks=.\r\n\r\nPain may be allayed by =opium= or =morphine=.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORROSIVE SUBLIMATE--PERCHLORIDE OF MERCURY--NITRATE OF MERCURY.\r\n\r\nEmpty the stomach by the =tube= or =pump=, and wash the organ out with\r\nplenty of white of egg, dissolved in water or milk. If the stomach-pump\r\nis not at hand, then give emetics, such as the solution of\r\n=apomorphine=, hypodermically, in from 4 to 5-drop doses, or a =zinc\r\nsulphate= emetic, or =mustard=, or =ipecacuanha=. Probably violent\r\nvomiting is already present, then stomach-tube or emetics are\r\nunnecessary: but, in any case, give plenty of albuminous fluids, such as\r\n=white of egg= in water or =milk=. If neither of these is at hand, chop\r\nany =fresh meat= up as finely as can be done in a short space of time,\r\ndiffuse in water, and administer. Follow up with =demulcent drinks=,\r\nsuch as =barley-water=, =flour= and =water=, &c.\r\n\r\nPain may be allayed with a little =opium= or =morphine=.\r\n\r\n=Stimulants= are admissible, if necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nCROTON OIL.\r\n\r\nEmpty stomach by means of =tube= or =pump=, or give emetics of =mustard=\r\nor =sulphate of zinc=, or administer hypodermic injection of\r\napomorphine.\r\n\r\nGive 10 drops of =laudanum= every twenty minutes or half hour, until the\r\npain and purging are somewhat abated, or else inject subcutaneously\r\nsmall doses of =morphine= at intervals.\r\n\r\nGive plenty of =demulcent drinks=.\r\n\r\nTwo or three drops of =essence of camphor= in milk are useful.\r\n\r\nStimulants, such as =brandy=, =ammonia=, or =chloric ether=, are\r\nadmissible.\r\n\r\n\r\nCYTISINE.--See LABURNUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nCURARINE--WOORARI--URARI.\r\n\r\nThe poison is of course introduced by a wound; if any is likely to be\r\nstill in the wound apply a =ligature=, =suck the wound=, and then wash\r\nit with a slightly alkaline solution of =potassic permanganate=.\r\n\r\nKeep up the =respiration artificially=, give plenty of =water= and a\r\ndose of spirits of nitre, apply warmth to the loins. By these means the\r\npoison will be rapidly separated by the urine; and, if the patient can\r\nonly be kept alive by artificial respiration for a little time, he may\r\nrecover, for elimination is very rapid.\r\n\r\n\r\nCYANIDE OF POTASSIUM.--See PRUSSIC ACID.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIGITALIS GROUP OF HEART POISONS, _including_, besides the DIGITALINS,\r\nANTIARIN, APOCYNIN, NERIIN, OLEANDRIN, EVONYMIN, THEVETIN, SCILLAIN,\r\nSTROPHANTIN, and ERYTHROPHLEIN.\r\n\r\nEmpty the stomach by the =tube= or =pump=, or administer a subcutaneous\r\ndose (4 drops) of =apomorphine=, or give a tablespoonful of =mustard= in\r\nwater, or =sulphate of zinc=.\r\n\r\nFollow up with strong =tea=, or half a drachm of =tannin=, or =gallic\r\nacid= in aqueous solution.\r\n\r\nA very small dose of =aconitine nitrate= in solution (say 1-200th of a\r\ngrain) may be injected subcutaneously and the effect watched; if in a\r\nlittle time it seems to do good, repeat the dose.

Kossa, considering that potassium permanganate ought,\r\ntheoretically, to act as a chemical antidote to potassium cyanide, by\r\nchecking the paralysis of the respiratory centres, has performed some\r\nexperiments. Rabbits were shown to be fatally affected in a few minutes\r\nby 0·01 grm. of the poison, but if, at the time of administration, 0·5\r\ngrm. of permanganate dissolved in 50 c.c. of water was also introduced\r\ninto the stomach, doses of cyanide up to 0·1 grm. failed to cause death.\r\nLarger quantities (0·2 grm.) proved fatal under similar conditions, but\r\nthe action of the poison was much delayed. Successful experiments were\r\nalso performed with aqueous solutions of hydrocyanic acid containing 0·1\r\nper cent. It is suggested, therefore, that, in cases of cyanide\r\npoisoning, ½ to ⅓ litre of a 3 to 5 per cent. solution of permanganate\r\nshould be administered immediately (_Vratch_, through _Nouv. rem._, ix.\r\n567).\r\n\r\nUse =stomach-pump= or =tube=, or, if not at hand, an emetic of =mustard=\r\nor =sulphate of zinc=.\r\n\r\nIf the breathing has stopped, try =artificial respiration= and weak\r\nshocks to the heart.\r\n\r\n1-60th of a grain of =atropine= subcutaneously is recommended to assist\r\nthe heart’s action.\r\n\r\nA =brandy enema= may be given, or brandy injected under the skin.\r\n\r\nThe body must be kept warm, but the cold =douche= may be advantageously\r\napplied to the head.\r\n\r\n\r\nSALTS OF SORREL.--See OXALIC ACID.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAVIN.\r\n\r\nIf the patient has not already emptied the stomach by repeated vomiting,\r\nand the throat is not inflamed, use the =stomach-pump= or =tube=, and\r\nwash the organ out with water, or give any one of the usual\r\nemetics--such as =mustard=, =sulphate of zinc=, or =ipecacuanha=.\r\n\r\nIf the bowels have not acted well, give a dose of =castor oil=; allay\r\npain with small doses of morphine.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCILLAIN.--See DIGITALIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSNAKES, BITE OF.\r\n\r\nSuck the wound, and apply an alkaline solution of =permanganate of\r\npotash=.\r\n\r\nIn severe cases of cobra poisoning and other extremely venomous snakes,\r\ndeath threatening, the only likely means of saving life would be\r\nbleeding at one arm and =transfusing= blood by the other.\r\n\r\n=Ammonia= may be given by the mouth, and also smelt.\r\n\r\nIn cobra poisoning and venoms which kill mainly through the respiration,\r\nthe breathing must be kept up artificially; and, should there be signs\r\nof the heart failing, weak, interrupted =galvanic= shocks may be applied\r\nto the walls of the chest.\r\n\r\nLacerda’s plan of injecting permanganate of potash under the skin is not\r\nalone useless but mischievous, for it takes up time which might be more\r\nvaluably employed.\r\n\r\n\r\nSODA CAUSTIC.--See ALKALIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLANINE--SOLANUM DULCAMARA--BITTER SWEET--WOODY NIGHTSHADE.--The same\r\ntreatment as for ATROPINE (_which see_).\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRAMONIUM.--The same treatment as for ATROPINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTROPHANTIN.--See DIGITALIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRYCHNINE--BRUCINE--NUX VOMICA.\r\n\r\nEmpty the stomach as quickly as possible by an emetic of =mustard=, or\r\n=zinc sulphate=, or by a hypodermic solution of =apomorphine= (4 drops).\r\n\r\nThe =stomach-pump= or =tube= inadmissible; for, if tetanus is present,\r\nit cannot be applied; or, if absent, it is likely to excite a spasm.\r\n\r\nPlace patient at once under =chloroform= or =ether=, and keep up a\r\ngentle narcosis for several hours, if necessary.\r\n\r\nDarken the room, stifle all noise; if in a town, and opportunity permit,\r\nhave straw or peat placed at once before the house to deaden noise.\r\n\r\nIf the spasms threaten the respiration, =artificial respiration= is\r\nabsolutely necessary; and, to facilitate this, it would be justifiable,\r\nin a dangerous case, to perform =tracheotomy=, of course under\r\nchloroform.\r\n\r\n=Chloral= may be given in place of chloroform, but the latter is best;\r\nthe dose of =chloral= should be, at least, half a drachm, and if no\r\neffect is produced in half an hour, then doses of 20 grains should be\r\ngiven at intervals of a quarter of an hour.\r\n\r\nIf neither chloroform nor chloral is at hand, the juice from a\r\nrecently-smoked pipe may be diffused in a little water and a few drops\r\ninjected subcutaneously, and the effect watched.

Large households, more especially those in which no one possesses\r\nany special medical knowledge, would do well to furnish an ANTIDOTE\r\nCUPBOARD, for use in cases of emergency. This cupboard may contain:--\r\n\r\n(1.) _The Multiple Antidote_, which consists of saturated solution of\r\nsulphate of iron 100 parts, water 800, magnesia 88, animal charcoal 44\r\nparts. It is best to have the animal charcoal and magnesia mixed\r\ntogether in the dry state and kept in a well-corked bottle; when\r\nrequired for use, the saturated solution of sulphate of iron is mixed\r\nwith eight times its bulk of water, and the mixture of charcoal and\r\nmagnesia added with constant stirring. The multiple antidote may be\r\ngiven in wine-glassful doses, frequently repeated, in poisoning by\r\narsenic, zinc, opium, digitalis, mercury, or strychnine; it is of no use\r\nin phosphorus poisoning, or in poisoning by the caustic alkalies or\r\nantimony.\r\n\r\n(2.) _Calcined Magnesia_, for use in poisoning by acids.\r\n\r\n(3.) _French Turpentine_, for poisoning by phosphorus.\r\n\r\n(4.) Powdered ipecacuanha in a well-corked bottle; the bottle containing\r\na small pill-box which is cut down, so that when full it contains 30\r\ngrains--the proper dose as an emetic. A similar small supply of sulphate\r\nof zinc may also be provided.\r\n\r\n(5.) A tin of mustard.\r\n\r\n(6.) A bottle of vinegar.\r\n\r\nIf, then, provided with such a supply, any member is known to have taken\r\npoison, and yet the precise poison is not known, give a =sulphate of\r\nzinc= or =ipecacuanha emetic=, and follow it up by the =multiple\r\nantidote=, which is in itself not poisonous.\r\n\r\nIf PHOSPHORUS has been taken, then give the =French turpentine= as\r\ndirected under Phosphorus (p. 697).\r\n\r\nIf ACIDS, neutralise by the =calcined magnesia= (see Acids, mineral, p.\r\n687).\r\n\r\nIf ALKALIES, neutralise with =vinegar= (see Alkalies, p. 688).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Abel and Field’s test for bismuth, 627.\r\n  Abrin, 462.\r\n  Abrus, 462.\r\n  Absynthin, 244.\r\n  Acetaldehyde, 154.\r\n  Acetanilide, 40.\r\n  Aceta-trimethyl-colchicin-amide, 409.\r\n  Acetic acid, 110.\r\n    „    Deaths from, 29.\r\n  Acetum digitalis, 422.\r\n  Acetyl phenyl hydrazine, 40.\r\n  Acid, carbolic.

In order to do full justice\r\nto the coloured illustrations, and to admit of more of the text being\r\nprinted in large type, it has been found necessary to put the work once\r\nagain in two volumes.\r\n\r\n\r\nOpinions of the Press.\r\n\r\n    “So great are the advantages offered by Prof. LANDOIS’ TEXT-BOOK,\r\n    from the EXHAUSTIVE and EMINENTLY PRACTICAL manner in which the\r\n    subject is treated, that it has passed through FOUR large editions\r\n    in the same number of years. . . . Dr. STIRLING’s annotations have\r\n    materially added to the value of the work. Admirably adapted for the\r\n    PRACTITIONER. . . .

To the STUDENT it will be EQUALLY\r\n    VALUABLE.”--_Edinburgh Medical Journal._\r\n\r\n    “LANDOIS AND STIRLING’S work cannot fail to establish itself as one\r\n    of the most useful and popular works known to English\r\n    readers.”--_Manchester Medical Chronicle._\r\n\r\n    “As a work of reference, LANDOIS and STIRLING’s Treatise OUGHT TO\r\n    TAKE THE FOREMOST PLACE among the text books in the English\r\n    language. The woodcuts are noticeable for their number and\r\n    beauty.”--_Glasgow Medical Journal._\r\n\r\n    “Unquestionably the most admirable exposition of the relations of\r\n    Human Physiology to Practical Medicine that has ever been laid\r\n    before English readers.”--_Students’ Journal._\r\n\r\n\r\nIN HANDSOME CLOTH.

ALMOST ANY\r\nPAGE MIGHT BE USED TO ILLUSTRATE THE FULNESS OF THE WORK IN THIS\r\nRESPECT. . . . The chapter on Eczema, that universal and most\r\ntroublesome ailment, describes in a comprehensive spirit, and with the\r\ngreatest accuracy of detail, the various methods of treatment.

HILL’S NOTE-BOOK.\r\n\r\n  1. It helps the Student to CODIFY HIS KNOWLEDGE.\r\n  2. Gives a grasp of BOTH SIDES of an argument.\r\n  3. Is INDISPENSABLE for RAPID RECAPITULATION.\r\n\r\n    _The Lancet_ says of it:--“The work which the Master of Downing\r\n    College modestly compares to a Note-book is an ADMIRABLE COMPENDIUM\r\n    of our present information . . . will be a REAL ACQUISITION to\r\n    Students . . . gives all ESSENTIAL POINTS. . . . The TYPOGRAPHICAL\r\n    ARRANGEMENT is a chief feature of the book. . . . Secures at a\r\n    glance the EVIDENCE on both sides of a theory.”\r\n\r\n    _The Hospital_ says:--“The Physiologist’s Note-book bears the\r\n    hall-mark of the Cambridge School, and is the work of one of the\r\n    most successful of her teachers. . . . Will be INVALUABLE to\r\n    students.”\r\n\r\n    _The British Medical Journal_ commends in the volume--“Its admirable\r\n    diagrams, its running bibliography, its clear Tables, and its\r\n    concise statement of the anatomical aspects of the subject.”\r\n\r\n    “If a Student could rely on remembering every word which he had ever\r\n    heard or read, such a book as this would be unnecessary; but\r\n    experience teaches that he constantly needs to recall the form of an\r\n    argument and to make sure of the proper =classification of his\r\n    facts=, although he does not need a second time to follow the author\r\n    up all the short steps by which the ascent was first made. With a\r\n    view to rendering the book useful for rapid recapitulation, I have\r\n    endeavoured to strike out every word which was not essential to\r\n    clearness, and thus, without I hope falling into ‘telegram’ English,\r\n    to give the text the form which it may be supposed to take in a\r\n    well-kept Note-book; at the same time, space has been left for the\r\n    =introduction in MS.= of such additional facts and arguments as seem\r\n    to the reader to bear upon the subject-matter. For the same reason\r\n    the drawings are reduced to =diagrams=. All details which are not\r\n    necessary to the comprehension of the principles of construction of\r\n    the apparatus or organ, as the case may be, are omitted, and it is\r\n    hoped that the drawings will, therefore, be easy to grasp, remember,\r\n    and reproduce.\r\n\r\n    “As it is intended that the ‘Note-book’ should be essentially a\r\n    Student’s book, no references are given to foreign literature or to\r\n    recondite papers in English; but, on the other hand, references are\r\n    given to a number of =classical English memoirs=, as well as to\r\n    descriptions in text-books which appear to me to be particularly\r\n    lucid, and the Student is strongly recommended to study the passages\r\n    and Papers referred to.”--_Extract from Author’s Preface._\r\n\r\n\r\nBy WILLIAM STIRLING, M.D., Sc.D.,\r\n\r\n    Professor in the Victoria University, Brackenbury Professor of\r\n    Physiology and Histology in the Owens College, Manchester; and\r\n    Examiner in the Universities of Oxford, Edinburgh, and London; and\r\n    for the Fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons, England.\r\n\r\n\r\n_SECOND EDITION.

JOHNSON SMITH, F.R.C.S., L.S.A.,\r\n\r\n    Of the Seamen’s Hospital, Greenwich; Surgeon, Seamen’s Hospital,\r\n    Royal Albert Docks; Surgeon, Seamen’s Hospital Society, &c., &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Transcriber’s Notes\r\n\r\n    This text follows the original work. Inconsistencies in spelling,\r\n    hyphenation, capitalisation, etc. have been retained, except as\r\n    mentioned below. This applies to chemical compound names as well.\r\n\r\n    Textual remarks:\r\n    Page 13, Footnote [18], Jerome Cardan: also known as Jérôme Cardan,\r\n    Girolamo Cardano, Hieronymus Cardanus.\r\n    Page 18, Praag van, Leonides: should be Leonides van Praag,\r\n    Isidorus. This is the (enlarged) Dutch translation of Werber’s book.\r\n    Page 52: reference to the separate article on (the detection of)\r\n    Tin: there is no such article in the book.\r\n    Page 62, footnote [55]: micro-millimetre should be micro-metre.\r\n    Page 175, structural formulas: the original work gives two identical\r\n    structural formulas; both are correct, but they do not show the\r\n    difference between the two compounds.\r\n    Page 192, that of Borussica: possibly a typographical error for\r\n    Borussia (Borussica is the adjective).\r\n    Page 399, 18·1 mgrms. (·18 grain): at least one of the numbers is\r\n    wrong (possibly the second number should be ·28).\r\n    Page 507: 6·4 mgmrs. (1 grain): this should probably be either 64\r\n    mgrms. or ·1 grain. In the context, the latter seems more probable.\r\n    Buchner/Büchner are different persons, both are spelled correctly.\r\n    Hofman/Hoffman/Hofmann/Hoffmann, Köhler/Koehler, Liné/Linné,\r\n    Pellagra/Pellagri, Schuchardt/Schuchart: possibly these are spelling\r\n    variants or typographical errors referring to the same persons.\r\n    Kapferschlaeger: should possibly be Kupferschlaeger.\r\n    Schaufféle: should possibly be Schauffele or Schäuffele.\r\n    The index has been left as in the original work, even though it is\r\n    not always alphabetic.\r\n    Advertisements: there are some references to pages 35 and 36 of the\r\n    advertisements. These pages were not present in the original.\r\n\r\n    Changes made to the text\r\n    Some minor obvious punctuation and typographical errors have been\r\n    corrected silently. French accents and German umlauts have been\r\n    added or corrected where needed.\r\n    Multi-page tables have been combined into single tables; many tables\r\n    have been re-arranged.\r\n    Structural formulas have been moved to separate lines.\r\n    Some sections starting with § were printed as section headers in the\r\n    original work; they have been treated as regular numbered sections\r\n    here.\r\n    Footnotes have been moved to under the paragraph, table, etc. they\r\n    refer to.\r\n\r\n    Various pages:\r\n    Chever/Chever’s changed to Chevers/Chevers’s\r\n    Ein natürliches System der Gift-wirkungen/Giftwirkungen standardised\r\n    to Gift-Wirkungen as in Loew’s original\r\n    Aertzt (also in compound words) changed to Aerzt\r\n    Bérenger-Férraud changed to Bérenger-Féraud\r\n    L.
