Every physician has heard of him,\r\nyet few know the details of his life, the circumstances under which his\r\nlabors were carried out, the extent of those labors, or their\r\nfar-reaching influence upon the progress of anatomy, physiology and\r\nsurgery. Comparatively few physicians have seen his works; and fewer\r\nstill have read them. The reformation which he inaugurated in anatomy,\r\nand incidentally in other branches of medical science, has left only a\r\ndim impress upon the minds of the busy, science-loving physicians of the\r\nnineteenth and twentieth centuries. That so little should be known about\r\nhim is not surprising, since his writings were in Latin and were\r\npublished prior to the middle of the sixteenth century. His books, which\r\nat one time were in the hands of all the scientific physicians of\r\nEurope, are now rarely encountered beyond the walls of the great medical\r\nlibraries of the world. They are among the _incunabula_ of the medical\r\nliterature. That English-speaking physicians know little of Vesalian\r\nliterature is due to the fact that no extensive biography of the great\r\nanatomist has appeared in our language. Most of the Vesalian literature\r\nwhich has been written by English and American authors has been in the\r\nform of brief articles for the medical press; these oftentimes have been\r\nincorrect and unillustrated. Perhaps the best example of this class is\r\nthe article by Mr. Henry Morley which appeared originally in _Fraser’s\r\nMagazine_, in 1853, and later was published in his _Clement Marot and\r\nOther Studies_, in 1871. The chief data for Vesalius’s biography are to\r\nbe found in his own writings, in the archives of the Universities in\r\nwhich he taught, and in the controversial literature of the period.\r\nExtensive as are these sources they leave much to be desired. A vast\r\nmass of Vesalian literature was printed, chiefly in the Latin language,\r\nduring the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Much of it is based on\r\ninsufficient evidence or on national prejudice. The Germans, the French,\r\nthe Dutch and the Italians have all taken a turn at it. In modern times\r\nthe monumental work of Roth, _Andreas Vesalius Bruxellensis_, Berlin,\r\n1892, has served to epitomize this literature and to make clear many\r\npoints which formerly were not understood. I have taken Roth’s book as a\r\nbasis for this monograph, without using the voluminous references which\r\nare found in the work of this thorough historian.\r\n\r\nThe man who overthrew the authority of Galen; revolutionized the\r\nteaching of the structure of the human body; started anatomical,\r\nphysiological, and surgical investigation in the right channels; first\r\ncorrectly illustrated his dissections; destroyed ancient dogmas, and\r\nmade many new discoveries—this man, Andreas Vesalius of Brussels,\r\ndeserves the name which Morley has given him, “the Luther of Anatomy.”\r\n\r\nAt long intervals a bright particular star appears in the intellectual\r\nhorizon, endowed with genius of such a superlative order as seemingly to\r\ncomprise within itself the whole domain of an entire science. These men\r\ndo not belong to any particular epoch in the development of the human\r\nmind. They are the eternal symbols of progress, and their history is the\r\nhistory of the science which they profess. Such men were Bacon, Galileo,\r\nDescartes, Newton, Lavoisier, and Bichat; and such also was Andreas\r\nVesalius the anatomist. Young, enthusiastic, courageous and diligent,\r\nVesalius dared to contradict the authority of Galen, corrected the\r\nanatomical mistakes of thirteen centuries and before his thirtieth year\r\npublished the most accurate, complete, and best illustrated treatise on\r\nanatomy that the world had ever seen. His industry, the success which\r\ncrowned his efforts, the jealousies which his discoveries aroused in the\r\nbreasts of his contemporaries, the honors which were conferred upon him\r\nby Charles the Fifth and Philip the Second, his pilgrimage to the Holy\r\nLand, and his tragic death—these are events which deserve to be\r\nchronicled by an abler pen than mine.\r\n\r\nThe year 1543 marks the date of a revolution which was won, not by force\r\nof arms but by the scalpel of an anatomist and the hand of an artist.\r\nThe whole of human anatomy, as a study involving correct descriptions of\r\nthe component parts of the body and accurate delineations thereof, may\r\nbe said to have been founded by Andreas Vesalius and Jan Stephan van\r\nCalcar. As light pouring into a prism attracts little notice until it\r\nemerges in iridescent hues, so it was with anatomy: after passing\r\nthrough the brain of Vesalius it bore rich fruit which has been gathered\r\nby many hands. To turn from the writings of Galen, Mondino, Hundt,\r\nPeyligk, Phryesen, and Berengario da Carpi to the beauties of Vesalius’s\r\n_De Humani Corporis Fabrica_ is like passing from darkness into\r\nsunlight. To both anatomists and artists this book was a revelation. For\r\nmore than a century after its appearance the anatomists of Europe did\r\nlittle more than make additions to, and compose commentaries upon the\r\nconjoint triumph of Vesalius and van Calcar. For more than two centuries\r\nthe osteologic and myologic figures of the _Fabrica_ formed the basis of\r\nall treatises on Art-Anatomy.\r\n\r\n

To learn the successive steps by which\r\nMedicine has advanced from a priest-ridden and secret art practiced with\r\nmysterious rites in the Greek temples, passing through the schools of\r\nGreek philosophy into the light of publicity, is his privilege. To hunt\r\nthrough musty and worm-eaten volumes for facts regarding the great\r\nphysicians of antiquity is his delight; and to communicate the knowledge\r\nthus obtained to others, who have not the time or the facilities for\r\nsuch research, is his duty. In every period are events and incidents of\r\ninterest, but to the Middle Ages a peculiar fascination attaches; for it\r\nwas during this period that Europe, emerging from an intellectual\r\ndarkness of ten centuries’ duration, awoke to the Renaissance, and\r\nMedicine, as ever has been the case, kept pace with the general advance\r\nof knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe present book deals with the life of a master whose work was an\r\nessential factor in the evolution of the Anatomical Renaissance. In\r\norder to understand the New Birth of Anatomy it is necessary to know\r\nsomething of the scope and influence of the General Renaissance.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe General Renaissance\r\n\r\nThis, the Revival of Learning, includes an indefinite time in European\r\nhistory. The seeds of the new movement were planted in the Middle Ages,\r\nbut they bore no fruit until the time had arrived for an apparently\r\n“spontaneous outburst of intelligence”. Definitions of the Renaissance\r\nwill vary with the point of view. Artists and sculptors will say it was\r\na revolution which was created by the recovery of ancient statues;\r\nlittérateurs and philosophers look upon it as a radical change due to\r\nthe discovery of the writings of the classical authors; astronomers and\r\nphysicists will cite the names of Copernicus, Galileo, and Torricelli;\r\ngeographers will point to the discovery of a New Continent; historians\r\nwill name the extinction of feudalism and the capture of Constantinople\r\nby the Turks; inventors will recall the changed conditions of warfare\r\nbrought about by gunpowder, the multiplication of books by the invention\r\nof printing, and the advent of new methods of engraving; and anatomists\r\nwill sound the praises of Leonardo da Vinci and of Andreas Vesalius. All\r\nwill agree that the Renaissance meant Revolution—revolution in thought,\r\nin conduct, in creed, and in conditions of existence. To no one fact can\r\nthe Renaissance be attributed; nor can its scope be limited to any one\r\nfield of human endeavor. The Renaissance was, and is, and will continue\r\nto be, as long as the race progresses.\r\n\r\nThe new movement began in Italy and grew rapidly. When, toward the end\r\nof the sixteenth century, the lamp of learning began to get dim in\r\nItaly, it was relighted by the nations of northern Europe—the Germans,\r\nthe Hollanders, and the English—and by them was transferred to us. The\r\nRevival consisted largely in the recovery of the buried writings of the\r\nancient Greek and Roman authors, together with comments on what they had\r\nwritten, and the production of books which were modeled after their\r\nworks. But it was broader than this. It included all branches of\r\nlearning, although more progress was made in some lines than in others.\r\n\r\nItaly, a country divided into numerous small States, and so-called\r\nRepublics, offered great opportunities for individual development and\r\nbecame famous in those paths in which individualism has gained its\r\ngreatest triumphs. Thus in literature, in law, in medicine, in painting\r\nand in sculpture, the Italians were preëminent. In architecture and in\r\nthe drama they reached no such heights as were attained by the French,\r\nthe Germans and the English. It was in the northwest part of Italy, in\r\nthe province of Tuscany, that the Renaissance gained its greatest\r\nvictories. Among the earliest of the leaders of the New Learning was the\r\nFlorentine poet, Dante Alighieri (1265-1321). “To Dante”, says Symonds,\r\n“in a truer sense than to any other poet, belongs the double glory of\r\nimmortalising in verse the centuries behind him, while he inaugurated\r\nthe new age”. His _Vita Nuova_ (New Life) and _Divina Commedia_ (Divine\r\nComedy) are essentially modern in thought, but ancient in the manner in\r\nwhich the thought is expressed.\r\n\r\nPetrarch may be said to fairly open the new era. Like Dante, he was a\r\nFlorentine. He was the apostle of Humanism, that system of philosophy\r\nwhich regarded man “as a rational being apart from theological\r\ndeterminations” and perceived that “classic literature alone displayed\r\nhuman nature in the plenitude of intellectual and moral freedom”. To a\r\nrevolt against the despotism of the Church, it added the attempt to\r\nunify all that had been taught and done by man. Petrarch was a poet, a\r\nlawyer, an orator, a priest, and a philosopher. He lived between the\r\nyears 1304-1374. He was a great traveler, and visited the leading\r\ncontinental cities in order to converse with learned men. Petrarch\r\ndelighted in the study of Cicero, in collecting manuscripts, and in\r\naccumulating coins and inscriptions for historic purposes. He advocated\r\npublic libraries and preached the duty of preserving ancient monuments.\r\nHe opposed the physicians and astrologers of his day, and ridiculed the\r\nfollowers of Averröes.\r\n\r\nBoccaccio, who has been called the Father of Italian Prose, and is most\r\nwidely known as the author of the _Decameron_, did not spend all of his\r\ntime in describing the escapades of the knights and ladies of old.\r\nInfluenced potently by Petrarch, Boccaccio regretted the years he had\r\nwasted in law and trade, when he should have been reading the classics.\r\nLate in life he began the study of Greek that he might read the _Iliad_\r\nand the _Odyssey_. What he lacked in genuine scholarship he made up in\r\nindustry. He continued the work begun by Petrarch of hunting for lost\r\nmanuscripts of the ancient Greek and Roman authors. Many of these\r\nprecious documents were stored in the conventual libraries, where, too\r\noften, they were either wantonly destroyed or were mutilated, the words\r\nof the author being erased from the parchment to make way for new\r\nprayers. Boccaccio tells of a visit which he made to the Benedictine\r\nMonastery of Monte Cassino near the city of Salernum. He wished to see\r\nthe books and found them in a room without door or key. Many of them\r\nwere mutilated. On making inquiry as to the cause, the monks answered\r\nthat they had sold some of the sheets, having first erased the original\r\nwords, replacing them with psalters. The margins of the old pages were\r\nmade into charms and were sold to women.\r\n\r\nIt was owing to the unselfish labors of such men as Petrarch and\r\nBoccaccio that the works of Livy, Cicero, Quintilian, Terence, and\r\nothers of the ancient authors, were preserved. In this enterprise they\r\nwere encouraged by the rulers. Thus Cosimo de’ Medici in Florence,\r\nAlfonso the Magnanimous in Naples, and Nicholas V. in Rome, to say\r\nnothing of the despots of the smaller cities, rivaled one another in\r\ntheir zeal in unearthing and multiplying the manuscripts of the ancient\r\nwriters. They spared neither time nor money to increase their store of\r\nmanuscript books. They surrounded themselves with learned men who lived\r\nin high esteem, and who were supported by salaries paid by the State or\r\nby private pensions.\r\n\r\nThe fifteenth century, which was one of the most remarkable epochs in\r\nhistory, was rich in accomplishment. Almost all of the great events\r\nwhich have influenced European commercial and intellectual development\r\ncan be traced to that period. The invention of printing, the discovery\r\nof America, the fall of the Roman Empire in the East, the birth of the\r\nReformation, and the rise of art in Italy, all belong to this wonderful\r\ncentury. In this period, when almost every city in Italy was a new\r\nAthens, the Italian poets, historians, and artists vied with the eminent\r\nmen of the ancient world in carrying the lamp of learning. The Italian\r\ncities—Florence, Bologna, Milan, Venice, Rome and Ferrara—fought with\r\none another, not for the spoils of the battlefield but for the victories\r\nof science and of art; not so much for the profits of commerce as for\r\nthe wealth of genius and of learning. The intellectual development which\r\noccurred in northern Italy under the rule of the house of Medici, and\r\nparticularly under the auspices of Lorenzo the Magnificent, forms one of\r\nthe most interesting periods in European history.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible in the present work to trace the steps by which the\r\nexquisite taste of the ancients in works of art was revived in modern\r\ntimes. Nevertheless, a few words may be devoted to this subject. While\r\nmuch must be credited to those Greek artists who had left their country\r\nand had settled in the Italian peninsula, it must be conceded that many\r\nof the works of art of the native Italians were not the less\r\nmeritorious. The same circumstances which favored the revival of\r\nletters, operated to further the cause of art; and the same individuals,\r\nwho were interested in the preservation of the manuscripts of the older\r\nauthors, also busied themselves with the collection of ancient statues,\r\npaintings, gems and tapestry. The freedom of the Italian Republics\r\npermitted the minds of men to expand to full fruition; and the\r\nencouragement which was given by its rulers to artists, sculptors and\r\nartisans, made the city of Florence, in the fifteenth century, a not\r\nless renowned centre of culture than Athens had been in ancient times.\r\n\r\nThe revival of art dates from the time of Cimabue (1240-1300) and Giotto\r\n(1276-1336). The former is known as the Father of Modern Painters; the\r\nlatter constructed the Campanile at Florence. To Giovanni Cimabue, scion\r\nof a noble Florentine family, is usually given the credit of being the\r\nrestorer of art in Italy. He is thought to have been the first painter\r\nto throw expression into the human countenance. His work, if judged by\r\npresent standards, would be called crude, rude and incomplete. Much of\r\nthe fame of this painter is to be attributed to his being the first\r\nperson whom Vasari chronicled in his _Lives of the Painters_. For more\r\nthan a century after the time of Cimabue and Giotto, painters displayed\r\nonly a smattering of anatomical knowledge.\r\n\r\nEarly in the fifteenth century two Flemish artists, Hubert van Eyck\r\n(1365-1426) and his brother John (1385-1441), in their polyptych of the\r\nAdoration of the Lamb, boldly struck out along new lines and committed\r\nthe unheard-of deed of painting nude figures. Italy, however, was the\r\nreal birthplace of Art-Anatomy. While the Flemings and others of the\r\nNorth painted everything that they saw, including the nude, the Italians\r\nwere the first men of the Renaissance who thought of painting the nude\r\nfigure before draping it. Leo Battista Alberti (1404-1472), in his works\r\non painting, insists that the bony skeleton must first be drawn and then\r\nclothed with its muscles and flesh. This was an important step in\r\nadvance, since it shows that the Florentine artists were progressing\r\ntowards realism and were breaking away from the symbolism of the early\r\nChristian painters and mosaic-workers. The new movement in art found a\r\nworthy champion in Antonio Pollaiuolo (1432-1498). In his knowledge of\r\nthe anatomy of the human figure he surpassed all of the artists of his\r\nday; and as a result of his labors he may justly be named the founder of\r\nthe scientific study of the nude. His knowledge of anatomy was so\r\naccurate, and so extensive, that it could have been gained only in the\r\ndissecting room.\r\n\r\nUnder the patronage of Lorenzo de’ Medici and the guiding mind of\r\nPollaiuolo, there occurred a revival of pseudo-paganism in Art. The old\r\nChurch subjects were largely neglected; mythological subjects again\r\nbecame the fashion; draperies were either modified or were laid aside;\r\nand the scientific study of anatomy, both as regards the nude figure and\r\nthe dissection of the individual parts, became the necessary training of\r\nthe student. Of all the masters of this period, the palm for excellence\r\nin drawing the naked figure must be awarded to Luca Signorelli\r\n(1442-1524), from whose work Michael Angelo is known to have profited.\r\n\r\nThe alliance between skilled anatomists and master artists was of\r\nreciprocal benefit. The anatomical studies which were made conjointly by\r\nLeonardo da Vinci and the celebrated teacher of anatomy, Marc Antonio\r\ndella Torre, were lost to the world by the untimely death of the latter,\r\nbefore he had finished a magnificent treatise on human anatomy.\r\nLeonardo’s anatomical sketches, if they had been published during his\r\nlifetime, would have revolutionized anatomy both as regards discoveries\r\nin the body and the teaching of the structure of man. These masterpieces\r\nof anatomical illustration long remained hidden from the world; they\r\nwere published only in the year 1902. Even now their cost is so great\r\nthat only a few wealthy libraries can possess them. Leonardo’s long\r\nunpublished drawings show him to have been a most accurate anatomist. At\r\nthe same time, he constantly kept in view the aim of fine art, which, in\r\nso far as practical anatomy is concerned, needs a knowledge of only the\r\nbones and the muscles.\r\n\r\nNor was Leonardo the only artist who made dissections. Raffaello Santi,\r\nMichael Angelo, Bartholomaus Torre, Luigi Cardi or Civoli, Jan Stephan\r\nvan Calcar, Giuseppe Ribera, Arnold Myntens, and Pietro da Cortona\r\nstudied practical anatomy. Rubens’s long-lost sketch-book[1], which was\r\npublished one hundred and thirty-three years after his death, shows with\r\nwhat care he had studied human anatomy. Albrecht Dürer’s _Treatise on\r\nthe Proportions of the Human Body_ is also worthy of mention.\r\n\r\nIn the number and fame of her Universities, Italy showed supremacy. At\r\nthe end of the fifteenth century she could boast of sixteen seats of\r\nlearning, a number equal to that of the combined institutions of\r\nBritain, France, Germany, Hungary, Bohemia and Bavaria.\r\n\r\nThis digression has led us away from the Humanists. Their list is a long\r\none. Among them were Poggio Bracciolini, who discovered the manuscript\r\nof the _Institutions_ of Quintilian and the writings of Vitruvius;\r\nPoliziano, the first poet of the fifteenth century, and the translator\r\nof the works of Hippocrates and Galen; Pontanus, whose _De Stellis_ and\r\n_Urania_ were much admired by Italian scholars; Sannazzaro, whose epic\r\non the birth of Christ cost him twenty years of labor; Vida, whose\r\n_Christiad_ and other poems were much admired; and Fracastoro, whose\r\n_Syphilis_ was hailed as a divine poem.\r\n\r\nFrom the viewpoint of the medical historian an important event occurred\r\nin the year 1443, when Thomas of Sarzana, later known as Pope Nicholas\r\nV., discovered a manuscript copy of the _De Medicina_ of Aulus Cornelius\r\nCelsus. This classic, which had been lost for many centuries, was one of\r\nthe first medical books to pass through the press. It gave physicians an\r\ninsight into Hippocratic medicine without the disadvantage of an\r\nimperfect translation. Physicians took an active part in the\r\nRenaissance. Thus Nicholas Leonicenus, of Ferrara, translated the\r\n_Aphorisms_ of Hippocrates and the _Natural History_ of Pliny; and\r\nWinter of Andernach did similar labor for the writings of Galen,\r\nAlexander, and Paulus Aegineta. Their efforts seem insignificant in\r\ncomparison with those of Anutius Foesius, a humble practitioner of Metz,\r\nwho spent forty years of his life in preparing a complete Greek edition\r\nof the works of Hippocrates. The New Learning was brought to England by\r\ntwo physicians, Thomas Linacre and John Kaye (Caius).\r\n\r\nSome of the Humanists were printers. The history of printing in Italy\r\nnaturally forms a part of the history of the Renaissance. In 1462,\r\nMaintz was pillaged by Adolph of Nassau and its printers were scattered\r\nover Europe. Two of them wandered into Italy, living in a village in the\r\nSabine mountains, where, in October, 1465, the first book was printed\r\nfrom an Italian press. It was a Latin edition of Lactantius. Six years\r\nlater a press was established in Florence. In 1478, Mondino’s\r\n_Anathomia_ was printed in Pavia. It has been estimated that before the\r\nfirst year of the sixteenth century, five thousand books had been\r\nprinted in Italy. In those days the editions were small, 265 copies\r\nbeing considered one edition. An immense amount of labor was required to\r\nget out a new edition. First, the manuscripts of the ancient author had\r\nto be collected, compared and corrected, this work being done by learned\r\nmen who resided in the home of the publisher. The corrections were made\r\nwithout the aid of dictionaries, grammars, or book-helps of any kind.\r\nThe proof was read aloud to the assembled scholars and the final\r\ncorrections were added. In time, Venice came to be the most noted of the\r\nItalian cities in the publishing business, owing chiefly to the family\r\nof Aldo. This family of printers became famous for finely printed Greek\r\nand Latin books, which are still called Aldine editions. Nine years\r\nafter the printing of the first book in Italy, the art was practiced in\r\nEngland by Caxton.\r\n\r\nHumanism in Italy began to decline toward the close of the fifteenth\r\ncentury. Long before this time it had degenerated into Paganism. The\r\nscholars influenced all life, customs and thought. Although the nation\r\nremained Catholic, it was such only in name. Everyone bowed before the\r\nshrine of classical literature. Even in the christening of children the\r\nChristian name was sacrificed to paganism. The saints were forgotten,\r\nand the names most frequently chosen were those from heathen mythology.\r\nThe polite authors described scenes, events and actions in their\r\nwritings in terms which long since have been banished from good society.\r\nA spade was called by its true name. Bembo, the secretary of Leo X.,\r\ncould write a hymn to Saint Stephen or a monologue for Priapus with\r\nequal ease and elegance. The amours of the high and the low were\r\nflaunted in print. The nation degenerated into an intellectual and\r\nsensual state which involved even the Popes. Scholars and rich men alike\r\nvied with one another in returning to those pursuits, habits, and\r\nmethods of thought which had ruled ancient Rome in her most corrupt\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nSuch a condition could not exist forever. The turning-point came in\r\n1527, when Charles the Fifth, engaging in war with Pope Clement VII.,\r\ncaptured and sacked the city of Rome. After that event everything was\r\nchanged. Not only had the scholars lost their influence, but many of\r\nthem had lost their lives. Valeriano, who returned to Rome after the\r\nsiege, pathetically exclaims: “Good God! when first I began to enquire\r\nfor the philosophers, orators, poets and professors of Greek and Latin\r\nliterature, whose names were written on my tablets, how great, how\r\nhorrible a tragedy was offered to me! Of all those lettered men whom I\r\nhad hoped to see, how many had perished miserably, carried off by the\r\nmost cruel of all fates, overwhelmed by undeserved calamities; some dead\r\nof plague, some brought to a slow end by penury in exile, others\r\nslaughtered by a foeman’s sword, others worn out by daily tortures;\r\nsome, again, and these of all the most unhappy, driven by anguish to\r\nself-murder”. Such was the end of the men who made the Italian\r\nRenaissance. The Spaniards, the Inquisition, and the changed policy of\r\nthe Church prevented a second revival of Humanism.\r\n\r\nWhile the sack of Rome marks the end of the Humanists, the Revival in\r\nMedicine continued to grow in vigor and extent. Many of the greatest\r\ndiscoveries in anatomy were made, and most of the important books on\r\nthis subject were written, in the middle and latter part of the\r\nsixteenth century. Italian history is rich in contradictions. While\r\npeace, ease and comfort are generally considered to be necessary to the\r\ndevelopment of science and culture, Italy offers the strange spectacle\r\nof the steady increase in medical knowledge in spite of wars and alarms.\r\nThe Inquisition, which had been introduced from Spain in 1224, was given\r\na new and horrible impetus when, in 1540, Paul III. appointed six\r\ncardinals to add to its tortures. One of them, Caraffa, became Pope Paul\r\nIV. in 1555, and four years later originated the _Index Expurgatorius_.\r\nTorn by civil and foreign wars, and terrorized by the Inquisition, which\r\nwas not abolished until late in the eighteenth century, Italy gradually\r\nlost her commercial and intellectual supremacy. That she should have\r\naccomplished so much under such unfavorable circumstances, is now a\r\nmatter of wonderment.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the Renaissance in Italy was due to many causes. The early\r\nRoman civilization was not entirely blotted out by the invasion of the\r\nbarbarians of the North. And in the matter of language the Italians\r\npossessed an advantage, since the transition from Latin to Italian was\r\neasier than from Latin to Spanish, French, English or German. The\r\nfertility of the country; the mildness of the climate; the division into\r\nsemi-independent states; the infusion of new northern blood into the\r\nveins of the Italians; the removal of the papal court to Avignon in\r\n1309; and the gradual rise of a powerful middle class, whose members\r\nincluded the devotees of the professions of law and medicine, were\r\nfactors which determined that Italy, rather than France or Spain, should\r\nbe the field for the Revival of Letters.\r\n\r\nTo Italy, then, belongs the glory of having been the first to free\r\nherself from the trammels of ancient scholasticism and the fetters of\r\nmediaeval theology. She abandoned the wordy dialectics and metaphysical\r\ngymnastics of the philosophers of old. In place of mortification,\r\npenance and solitary confinement in cloistered monasteries and convents,\r\nshe began to have a proper conception of the dignity of man and his\r\nrelation to nature.\r\n\r\nItaly, in the time of her freedom, received the torch of learning from\r\nGreece; Italy revived its brilliancy, and, when her time of adversity\r\nand ruin arrived, she passed it on to the nations of Northern Europe.\r\nThey in turn have transferred it to America, to Australia, to India, and\r\nto the uttermost parts of the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Anatomical Renaissance\r\n\r\nItaly in the sixteenth century was the fount from which issued a\r\nceaseless stream of anatomical discoveries. The ancient and illustrious\r\nUniversities of Bologna, Pavia, Padua, Pisa and Rome, eclipsed the\r\nschools of Paris and Montpellier, of Toulouse and Salamanca; and the\r\nItalian peninsula, which, in early mediaeval times, had gloried in the\r\nskill of the physicians of Salernum, a second time became the medical\r\ncentre of Europe. Vesalius and his pupil, Fallopius, taught at Padua;\r\nthe ancient fame of Bologna was supported by Arantius and Varolius;\r\nVidius, returned from establishing the anatomical school at Paris,\r\ntaught at Pisa; Eustachius was at Rome, Ingrassias lectured at Naples,\r\nand the fame of the New Anatomy spread throughout the world. The Italian\r\ncities were filled with students from foreign lands. Padua had more than\r\none thousand new students every year, salaries were paid to her one\r\nhundred professors, and medicine was looked upon as a noble profession.\r\n\r\nWhile the Italians were the leaders in progress, the Germans were still\r\nlecturing on Galen and Avicenna, the English had done almost nothing,\r\nand the Collége de France was not established until 1530.\r\n\r\nLegalized by imperial authority and sanctioned by the Church, dissection\r\nwas no longer regarded as a crime. A bull by Pope Boniface VIII., issued\r\nin the year 1300, forbidding the evisceration of the dead and the\r\nboiling of their bodies to secure the bones for consecrated ground, as\r\nwas done by the Crusaders, was wrongly interpreted as forbidding\r\nanatomical dissection. Two centuries later the Popes, standing in the\r\nvanguard of science, permitted dissections to be made in all the Italian\r\nmedical schools, and paved the way for the Anatomical Renaissance.\r\n\r\nGreat things were done in the sixteenth century. Under the scalpel and\r\npen of Vesalius, anatomy was revolutionized. Surgery was guided into new\r\npaths by Ambroise Paré; and obstetrics, thanks to the labors of\r\nEucharius Rhodion and Jacques Guillemeau, began to assume its legitimate\r\nplace among the medical sciences. Servetus, visionary and argumentative,\r\ncorrectly described the pulmonary circulation in a theological work\r\nwhich was burned with its author. Eustachius, Columbus and Fallopius\r\nwidened the path which had been blazed by Vesalius. Arantius,\r\nCaesalpinus and Fabricius added materially to anatomical science. The\r\nlabors of all these great masters prepared the way for the greatest\r\nevent occurring in the seventeenth century, namely, William Harvey’s\r\ndiscovery of the circulatory movement of the blood.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: INITIAL LETTER BY VESALIUS\r\n    (From the “Fabrica”, 1543)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER FIRST\r\n                        Anatomy in Ancient Times\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Illuminated capital]\r\n\r\nEgypt and Greece were the sources of the medical learning of the ancient\r\nworld. Although the Egyptians and early Greeks possessed a certain\r\namount of anatomical knowledge, which was gained in the one instance by\r\nthe practice of embalming and in the other by an examination of the\r\nbones, no real progress could be made because of the laws, customs and\r\nprejudices of those ancient peoples. Thus we find the Egyptians stoning\r\nthe operator who opened the abdomen in order that the body might be\r\nembalmed; and the Greeks inflicted the death penalty on those of their\r\ngenerals who, after a battle, neglected to bury or burn the remains of\r\nthe slain.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: HIPPOCRATES]\r\n\r\nIn the time of Hippocrates, whose life extended approximately over the\r\nperiod between 460-377 B.C., Greek medicine emerged from the domination\r\nof the Asclepiadae, or priests of Aesculapius, who had followed it as an\r\nhereditary and secret art. Prior to this time in the numerous Asclepia,\r\nor Temples of Aesculapius, votive offerings had been accepted, some of\r\nwhich were of anatomical interest. Thus the Temple at Athens received a\r\nsilver heart and gold eyes. Pausanias states that Hippocrates gave to\r\nthe Temple of Apollo, at Delphos, a skeleton which was made of brass.\r\nPossibly, as Moehsen[2] believes, this was a metallic figure\r\nrepresenting a man who was much emaciated by the ravages of disease. In\r\nthe Hippocratic writings, some of which are undoubtedly spurious, are\r\nfew references to the opening of a dead body; and these examinations\r\nconcern the investigation of the thorax and abdomen in order to\r\ndetermine the cause of death. While the Greek physicians knew little of\r\nthe human muscles, of the nervous system and of the organs of sense,\r\nthey were well acquainted with the anatomy of the bones. Their\r\ndissections were held upon the lower animals.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to determine whether or not the Greek physicians of the\r\nHippocratic period dissected the human body. “It has long been a matter\r\nof debate”, says John Bell[3], “whether the ancients were, or were not,\r\nacquainted with anatomy, and the subject, with its various bearings, has\r\nbeen much and keenly agitated by the learned. If anatomy had been much\r\nknown to the ancients, their knowledge would not have remained a subject\r\nof speculation. We should have had evidence of it in their works; but,\r\non the contrary, we find Hippocrates spending his time in idle\r\nprognostics, and dissecting apes, to discover the seat of the bile.”\r\n\r\nGalen[4] states that the ancient physicians did not write works on\r\nanatomy; that such treatises were at that time unnecessary, because the\r\nAsclepiadae—to which family Hippocrates belonged—secretly instructed\r\ntheir young men in this subject; and that opportunities were given for\r\nsuch study in the temples of Aesculapius.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ARISTOTLE]\r\n\r\nThe first systematic dissections seem to have been made by the\r\nPythagorean philosopher Alcmaeon, who lived in the sixth century B. C.,\r\nbut it is uncertain whether he dissected brutes or men. The cochlea of\r\nthe ear and the amnios of the foetus were named by Empedocles of\r\nAgrigentum, in the fifth century B. C. The nerves were first\r\ndistinguished from the tendons by Aristotle, (384-322 B. C.), the most\r\ncelebrated zoötomist of antiquity, who has been called the Father of\r\nComparative Anatomy. For twenty centuries his views of natural phenomena\r\nwere held in high esteem.\r\n\r\nFor a long period the early inhabitants of Rome were practically without\r\nphysicians. During severe epidemics they had recourse to oracles, to the\r\nhealth deities of the Greeks, and to their native gods. As early as the\r\nfifth century B. C., during a pestilence, a temple was erected to Apollo\r\nas Healer. The worship of Aesculapius was introduced into Rome in the\r\nyear 291 B. C. Livy relates that the god of medicine in the guise of a\r\nserpent was transported from Epidaurus, in Greece, to the Isle of the\r\nTiber where a temple was built in his honor.\r\n\r\nThe Romans, like the Greeks, were accustomed to leave votive offerings,\r\nor donaria, in their temples. Such gifts included surgical instruments,\r\npharmaceutical appliances, painted tablets representing miraculous\r\ncures, and great numbers of images of various parts of the human frame\r\nshaped in metal, stone or terra-cotta. Among the remains of Roman\r\nanatomical art is the marble figure which was unearthed in the villa of\r\nAntonius Musa, the favorite physician of the Emperor Augustus. It is a\r\nhuman torso; the front of the chest and abdomen has been removed so as\r\nto expose the viscera. The heart is placed vertically in the middle of\r\nthe thorax, thus corresponding to the position of this organ as\r\ndescribed by Galen who made his dissections on apes. It is a human\r\nthorax with simian contents. The figure is supposed to have been\r\nconstructed for the purposes of a teacher of anatomy.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ALEXANDER THE GREAT]\r\n\r\nIt was in the famous Alexandrian University that human anatomy was first\r\nstudied systematically and legally.\r\n\r\nAlexander the Great, after the fall of Tyre (332 B. C.) and the siege of\r\nGaza, ordered his fleet to sail up the Nile as far as Memphis while he\r\nproceeded overland with the army. It was probably on this march, while\r\nviewing the pyramids and other marvelous works of the ancient Egyptians,\r\nthat he conceived the grand idea of founding a city upon the banks of\r\nthe Nile, which should be a model of architectural beauty, a centre of\r\nintellectual life and a lasting monument of his own greatness and\r\nmagnificence. The foundation of Alexandria was laid by the warrior whose\r\nname it bears; but the credit of instituting the Library belongs to one\r\nof his lieutenants, Ptolemy Soter.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PTOLEMY SOTER]\r\n\r\nThe new city which for centuries was the intellectual and commercial\r\nstorehouse of Europe, Africa and India, was of oblong form. Lake\r\nMareotis washed its walls on the south, while the Mediterranean bathed\r\nits ramparts on the north. Provided with broad streets, it was adorned\r\nwith magnificent houses, temples and public buildings. At the centre of\r\nthe city was the Mausoleum in which was deposited the body of Alexander,\r\nembalmed after the manner of the Egyptians. Alexandria was divided into\r\nthree parts: the _Regio Judaeorum_ or Jews’ quarter, in the northwest;\r\nthe _Rhacotis_, or Egyptian section, on the west, containing the\r\nSerapeum with a large part of the Library; and on the north, the\r\n_Bruchaeum_, or Greek portion, containing the greater part of the\r\nLibrary, the Museum, the Temple of the Caesars and the Court of Justice.\r\nThe population was cosmopolitan in character; the statues of the Greek\r\ngods stood by the side of those of Osiris and of Isis; the Jews forgot\r\ntheir language and spoke Greek; and under the Ptolemies, who were of\r\nGreek descent, Alexandria became a centre of intellectual life and\r\nculture.\r\n\r\nTo the medical historian the most interesting feature of Alexandria was\r\nthe Museum or University. Here were assembled the intellectual giants of\r\nthe earth: Archimedes and Hero, the philosophers; Apelles, the painter;\r\nHipparchus and Ptolemy, the astronomers; Euclid, the geometer;\r\nEratosthenes and Strabo, the geographers; Manetho, the historian;\r\nAristophanes, the rhetorician; Theocritus and Callimichus, the poets;\r\nand Erasistratus and Herophilus, the anatomists, all of whom labored in\r\nquiet upon the peaceful banks of the Nile. The early Christian church\r\ndrew from “the divine school at Alexandria” such eminent teachers as\r\nOrigen and Athanasius. Here were a chemical laboratory, a botanical and\r\nzoölogical garden, an astronomical observatory, a great library, and a\r\nroom for the dissection of the dead.\r\n\r\nIn the Alexandrian school of medicine Erasistratus and Herophilus taught\r\nthe science of organization from actual dissections. The generosity of\r\nthe Ptolemies not only furnished them with an abundance of dead\r\nmaterial, but condemned malefactors were used for human vivisection.\r\nCelsus[5] states that the Alexandrian anatomists obtained criminals,\r\n“for dissection alive, and contemplated, even while they breathed, those\r\nparts which nature had before concealed.”\r\n\r\nHerophilus made many anatomical discoveries. He traced the delicate\r\narachnoid membrane into the ventricles of the brain, which he held to be\r\nthe seat of the soul; and first described that junction of the six\r\ncerebral sinuses opposite the occipital protuberance, which to this day\r\nis called the _torcular Herophili_. He saw the lacteals, but knew not\r\ntheir use, and regarded the nerves as organs of sensation arising from\r\nthe brain; he described the different tunics of the eye, giving them\r\nnames which are still retained; and first named the duodenum and\r\ndiscovered the epididymis. He attributed the pulsation of arteries to\r\nthe action of the heart; the paralysis of muscles to an affection of the\r\nnerves; and first named the furrow in the fourth cerebral ventricle,\r\ncalling it _calamus scriptorius_.\r\n\r\nErasistratus gave names to the auricles of the heart; declared that the\r\nveins were blood-vessels; and the arteries, from being found empty after\r\ndeath, were air-vessels. He believed that the purpose of respiration was\r\nto fill the arteries with air; the air distended the arteries, made them\r\nbeat, and in this manner the pulse was produced. When once the air\r\ngained entrance to the left ventricle, it became the vital spirits. The\r\nfunction of the veins was to carry blood to the extremities. He is said\r\nto have had a vague idea of the division of nerves into nerves of\r\nsensation and of motion; to the former he assigned an origin in the\r\nmembranes of the brain, while the latter proceeded from the cerebral\r\nsubstance itself. He recognized the use of the trachea as the tube which\r\nconveys air to the lungs. A catheter, the first invented, which was\r\nfigured in ancient surgical works, bore the name of the catheter of\r\nErasistratus. He gravely tells us, as the result of his anatomical\r\nstudies, that the soul is located in the membranes of the brain.\r\n\r\nThe practice of human dissection did not long exist in the city of its\r\norigin, and after the second century was unknown. Then science underwent\r\na retrogression; observations and experiments were replaced by useless\r\ndiscussions and subtle theories. The decline of the Alexandrian\r\nUniversity was due to a series of disasters which began with the Roman\r\ndomination and reached their climax with the capture of the city by the\r\nArabs.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: GALEN]\r\n\r\nClaudius Galenus, the celebrated Roman physician whose writings were for\r\ncenturies accepted as authority and whose reputation was second only to\r\nthat of Hippocrates, was obliged to base his anatomical treatises\r\nlargely upon the dissection of the lower animals. He advised his pupils\r\nto visit Alexandria, where he had studied, in order that they might\r\nexamine the human skeleton. He complained that the physicians of his\r\ntime—in the reign of Marcus Aurelius—had entirely neglected anatomical\r\nknowledge and had degenerated into mere sophists. He appreciated the\r\nimportance of anatomy, particularly to a surgeon who is called upon to\r\ntreat wounds and injuries. Hence he has endeavored in the four books,\r\n_De Anatomicis Administrationibus_, to cover this part of anatomy as\r\nexhaustively as possible.\r\n\r\nGalen’s voluminous writings form a precious monument of ancient\r\nmedicine. The works of the Alexandrian anatomists having been destroyed,\r\nwe know of their labors chiefly from what Galen has said of them. His\r\ntreatises show a remarkable familiarity with practical anatomy, although\r\nhis dissections were made upon the lower animals. Galen’s knowledge of\r\nosteology was extensive. He described the bones of the skull, the\r\ncranial sutures, and the essential features of the malar, maxillary,\r\nethmoid and sphenoid bones. He divided the vertebrae into cervical,\r\ndorsal and lumbar classes. He knew that both arteries and veins were\r\nblood-carrying vessels; he described the valves of the heart, and\r\nrecognized this organ as the source of pulsation. He erroneously taught\r\nthat the interventricular septum presents foramina through which the two\r\nkinds of blood become mixed.\r\n\r\nIn myology Galen made numerous advances. “Previous to his\r\ninvestigations”, says Fisher[6] “much confusion existed as to what\r\nconstituted a single muscle; he adopted the general rule of considering\r\neach bundle of fibers that terminates in an independent tendon to be one\r\nmuscle. He was the first to describe and give names to the platysma\r\nmyoides, the sterno- and thyro-hyoides, and the popliteal. He described\r\nthe six muscles of the eye, two muscles of the eyelids, and four pairs\r\nof muscles of the lower jaw—the temporal to raise, the masseter to draw\r\nto one side, and two depressors, corresponding to the digastric and\r\ninternal pterygoid muscles. He described also the brachialis anticus,\r\nthe biceps flexor cubiti, the sphincter and levator ani, and the\r\nstraight and oblique muscles of the abdomen. In short, he described the\r\ngreater portion of the muscles of the body, his treatise differing\r\nchiefly from a modern one in the minute account of these organs and in\r\nthe omission of some of the smaller muscles.” Galen studied the brain\r\nand named the corpus callosum, the septum lucidum, the corpora\r\nquadrigemina and the fornix; but erroneously stated that the nerves of\r\nsensation arise from the brain, and those of motion from the spinal\r\ncord. He denied the decussation of the optic nerves. He described the\r\npneumogastric and sympathetic nerves; seven pairs of cerebral and thirty\r\npairs of spinal nerves; and claimed the discovery of the ganglia of the\r\nnervous system. He located the seat of the soul in the brain, which also\r\nis the source of the rational mind; the heart to him was the source of\r\ncourage and of anger, and the liver was the seat of desire. Many of\r\nGalen’s anatomical statements show that he derived his knowledge from\r\ncomparative dissections.\r\n\r\nThe Galenic era was followed by that long period of ignorance, of\r\nslumber and of inaction which is justly known as the Dark Ages. While a\r\nfew Greek and Arab writers, who came after Galen, contributed to the\r\nliterature of medicine and surgery, they did nothing for anatomy. After\r\nthe end of the fifth century even the works of Galen were forgotten. At\r\nthis period, when medicine was chiefly in the hands of the Jews, the\r\nArabs and the bigoted clergy, nothing was done for science or for art.\r\nThe whole influence of Christianity was exerted against the schools of\r\nphilosophy. Illustrious apostles of the Church pronounced anathemas\r\nagainst the reading of the ancient classics;[7] and eminent\r\necclesiastics regarded disease as a divine penalty or as an invaluable\r\naid to saintly advancement. Art and anatomy were practically forgotten.\r\nTheir Renaissance occurred almost simultaneously.\r\n\r\nDuring the period from the seventh to the fourteenth centuries the\r\nschool of Salernum was for medicine what Bologna became for law and\r\nParis for philosophy. Here, for eight hundred years, medicine was taught\r\nto thousands of students and the impress of the profession was so potent\r\nthat the city called itself _Civitas Hippocratica_, and thus its seals\r\nwere stamped. Here medical diplomas were first issued to waiting\r\nstudents who took a sacred oath to serve the poor without pay. Here with\r\na book in his hand, a ring on his finger and a laurel wreath on his\r\nhead, the candidate was kissed by each professor and was told to start\r\nupon his way. Here women were professors and vied with men in spreading\r\nthe doctrines of our art.\r\n\r\nFor a period of several hundred years anatomy was taught at Salernum\r\nfrom dissections made upon pigs. Copho, one of the Salernian professors\r\nof the early part of the twelfth century, wrote a treatise, _Anatomia\r\nPorci_, which gives minute directions regarding the manner in which the\r\nanimal is to be dissected. Another anatomical work of later date,\r\nwritten by a member of the Salernian faculty, is entitled _Demonstratio\r\nAnatomica_; it also deals only with comparative anatomy. In the\r\nthirteenth century (A. D. 1231) Frederick II., Emperor of Germany and\r\nKing of the Two Sicilies, and the author of a treatise which contained a\r\ncomplete anatomy of the falcon, decreed that a human body should be\r\nanatomized at Salernum at least once in five years. Physicians and\r\nsurgeons of the kingdom were required to be present at the dissection.\r\nSo far as is known, no record has been kept of these demonstrations.\r\nCreditable as was this anatomic decree, the great Hohenstaufen in other\r\nrespects was not free from the errors of his age. A firm believer in\r\n_Medicina Astrologica_, he did not decide upon any undertaking until the\r\nstars had been consulted.\r\n\r\nIt was not alone at Salernum that dissection was legalized in the\r\nthirteenth century. A document of the year 1308, of the Maggiore\r\nConsiglio of Venice, shows that a medical college located in that city\r\nwas authorized to dissect a body once a year. This, and other isolated\r\nexamples, indicate that the time was approaching when anatomy should be\r\ntaught from human dissections. The credit of reinaugurating the teaching\r\nof this useful department of science belongs to Mondino dei Luzzi of\r\nBologna.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Ornamental block]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER SECOND\r\n                    Mondino, the Restorer of Anatomy\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Illuminated capital]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1315, in the old Italian city of Bologna, an event occurred\r\nwhich marks an important epoch in the history of medicine. A wondering\r\ncrowd of medical students witnessed the dissection of a human\r\ncadaver—one of the few procedures of the kind that had occurred since\r\nthe fall of the Alexandrian University. Acting under royal authority\r\nMondino, a man far in advance of the age, placed the body of a female\r\nupon a table where for many centuries before only the cadavera of apes,\r\nof swine and of dogs had been studied.\r\n\r\nMondino, known also as Mundinus, Mundini, Raimondino, or Mondino dei\r\nLuzzi, was descended from a prominent Italian family. Little is known of\r\nhis life. The year of his birth is disputed; probably 1276 was near the\r\ntime. He was graduated in medicine in 1290 and in 1306 he became a\r\nprofessor in the University of Bologna, holding his chair with credit\r\nuntil his death in 1326. Like that of the illustrious Homer, Mondino’s\r\nnativity has been claimed by several rival cities. Guy de Chauliac,\r\nwriting in 1363, states that Mondino was a Bolognese: _Mundinus\r\nBononiensis_ is Chauliac’s expression.\r\n\r\nMondino’s method of teaching anatomy is known from Chauliac’s\r\ntestimony:—“Mundinus of Bologna, wrote on anatomy, and my master,\r\nBertruccius, demonstrated it many times in this manner:—The body having\r\nbeen placed on a table, he would make from it four readings; in the\r\nfirst the digestive organs were treated, because more prone to rapid\r\ndecomposition; in the second, the organs of respiration; in the third,\r\nthe organs of circulation; in the fourth the extremities were treated.”\r\nThe innovation so auspiciously begun was not continued, and after the\r\ndeath of Mondino human dissections were made only at long intervals. The\r\nfew instances in which, in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, the\r\necclesiastical and civil authorities granted the right to make\r\ndissections only prove the contention, that the practical study of human\r\nanatomy did not gain recognition until the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nWhen Mondino began his dissections the epoch of Saracen learning had\r\nended, but the influence of Arab medicine exerted by the writings of\r\nAlbucasis, Avicenna and Rhazes had not declined. The Arabian physicians\r\nhad accomplished little for anatomy. In this line the influence of Galen\r\nwas still potent, and was rarely questioned until the publication of the\r\n_Fabrica_ of Vesalius in 1543. During a long period the little treatise\r\nof Mondino held full sway in the mediaeval schools. Medicine was taught\r\nin the University of Bologna, which as early as the twelfth century was\r\ncelebrated for its departments of literature and of law. These studies\r\nwere free of the difficulties which beset medicine. The prejudice\r\nagainst dissection was so great that for nearly a century after his\r\ndeath few men dared to repeat the acts of Mondino.\r\n\r\nIn 1316 Mondino issued his book which remained in manuscript form for\r\nmore than one hundred and fifty years, the first printed edition bearing\r\nthe date 1478. Small and imperfect as it was, it marks an era in the\r\nhistory of science. By command of the authorities this book was read in\r\nall the Italian Universities. The work of Mondino contained no new\r\nfacts; it was compiled largely from the writings of Galen and of\r\nAvicenna. The descriptions, to use the words of Turner, “are corrupted\r\nby the barbarous leaven of the Arabian schools, and his Latin is defaced\r\nby the exotic nomenclature of Ibn-Sina and Al-Rasi”. Mondino divided the\r\nbody into three cavities, of which the upper contains the animal\r\nmembers, the lower the natural members, and the middle the spiritual\r\nmembers. Many of his names are borrowed from the Arab writers. Thus, he\r\ncalls the peritoneum _siphac_, the omentum _zyrbi_, and the mesentery\r\n_eucharus_. His description of the heart is much nearer accuracy than\r\nwould be expected. He resorted to vivisection, and tells us that when\r\nthe recurrent nerves of the larynx are cut the animal’s voice is lost.\r\nIn his book we find the rudiments of phrenology. He states that the\r\nbrain is divided into compartments, each of which holds one of the\r\nfaculties of the intellect.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: MONDINO’S DIAGRAM OF THE HEART, 1513]\r\n\r\nMondino did not himself make the dissections which are credited to him.\r\nAccording to an ancient custom which lasted until the time of Vesalius,\r\nthe actual cutting was done by a barber who wielded a knife as large as\r\na cleaver. The professor of anatomy sat upon an elevated seat and\r\ndiscoursed concerning the parts, while a demonstrator, who also did not\r\nsoil his fingers, pointed to the different structures with a staff.\r\nOriginally Mondino’s book contained no figures; when the art of wood\r\nengraving was introduced in the latter part of the fifteenth century, a\r\nfew rude woodcuts appeared which represent Mondino and his method of\r\nteaching. In the _Fasciculus Medicinae_ of Joannes de Ketham, published\r\nat Venice in 1493, Mondino’s book is printed with an illustration\r\nshowing a demonstration in anatomy.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mondino the heart is placed in the centre of the body. The\r\nvalves he considers “wonderful works of nature”. He describes a right,\r\nleft and middle ventricle. The right ventricle has thinner walls than\r\nthe left, because it contains blood; the left one contains the vital\r\nspirit, which passes through the arteries to the body; and the middle\r\nventricle consists of many small cavities “broader on the right side\r\nthan on the left, to the end that the blood, which comes to the left\r\nventricle from the right, be refined, because its refinement is the\r\npreparation for the generation of vital spirit, which should be\r\ncontinually formed”. Mondino describes five bones of the head, separated\r\nby three sutures—coronal, sagittal and occipital. The brain has two\r\nmembranes: dura and pia. There are three cerebral ventricles—anterior,\r\nposterior and middle—and in these he locates the various intellectual\r\nqualities. He describes the cerebral nerves: olfactory, optic, motor\r\noculi, facial, vagus, trigeminal, auditory and hypoglossal. He calls the\r\ninnominate bone _os femoris_: the femur, _canna coxae_; the humerus, _os\r\nadjutori_; while the bones of both leg and forearm are named _focilia_\r\nmajor and minus.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ANATOMICAL DEMONSTRATION IN 1493\r\n    (Joannes de Ketham)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: TITLE-PAGE OF MONDINO’S ANATOMY BY MELERSTAT\r\n    (Printed before 1500)]\r\n\r\nLike many anatomists who succeeded him, Mondino mingled surgical ideas\r\nwith his anatomical statements. A break in the _siphac_ causes hernia\r\nand a swelling in the _mirach_. He treated ascites by puncture and\r\nevacuation, making a valve-like opening. Wounds of the large intestines\r\nmust be sutured; if the wound be in the small intestines he advises that\r\n“you should have large ants, and, making them bite the conjoined lips of\r\nthe wound, decapitate them instantly, and continue until the lips remain\r\nin apposition and then reduce the gut as before”. He gives an\r\nexplanation of the length and convolution of the intestines; “for if it\r\nwere not convoluted the animals would have to be continuously ingesting\r\nfood and continuously defecating, which would impede engagement in the\r\nhigher occupations”. Digestion is aided by black bile from the spleen\r\nand by red bile from the liver. The kidneys he regards as glands in\r\nwhich urine is extracted from the blood. The renal veins expand and form\r\na fine membrane like a sieve through which the urine is filtered but\r\nblood cannot pass. He mentions renal calculi: if small they pass through\r\nthe ureter; if large they are incurable except by incision, and this is\r\nto be avoided. The uterus and breasts are connected by veins, hence the\r\nsympathy between these organs. Inguinal hernia is to be operated upon;\r\nthe spermatic cord and testicle may or may not be dissected out, or the\r\nhernia may be treated by the application of a caustic. An incision in\r\nthe neck of the bladder will heal, because this part is muscular; but a\r\ncut in the body of the organ will not heal. He describes the operation\r\nfor stone:—The patient being in proper position, the stone is conducted\r\nto the neck of the bladder by the finger in the rectum; an incision is\r\nmade and the stone is pulled out with an instrument called\r\n_trajectorium_.\r\n\r\nMondino’s book passed through not less than twenty-three editions\r\nbetween the years 1478-1580. The only manuscript extant is in the\r\nNational Library at Paris.\r\n\r\nThe first printed edition of the _Anathomia Mundini_, Pavia, 1478, is a\r\nfolio of twenty-two leaves. The Strassburg edition, 1513, is a small\r\noctavo volume of forty leaves. It contains a diagram of the heart and an\r\nastrological figure, a cadaver with the thorax and abdomen opened,\r\nsurrounded by the signs of the zodiac. Such was the volume which for\r\nmore than two hundred years was supposed to contain all that was to be\r\nsaid of human anatomy!\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: COLOPHON OF THE ANATOMY OF MONDINO, 1513]\r\n\r\nSo numerous are the abbreviations in Mondino’s book, so barbarous is his\r\nstyle, that the making of a translation is a difficult task. His reasons\r\nfor writing are these:—“A work upon any science or art—as saith Galen—is\r\nissued for three reasons; _First_, that one may help his friends.\r\n_Second_, that he may exercise his best mental powers. _Third_, that he\r\nmay be saved from the oblivion incident to old age”.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER THIRD\r\n                          Mondino’s Successors\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Illuminated capital]\r\n\r\nFor two hundred years anatomists used Mondino’s book as a text for their\r\nlectures and for the same period anatomical writers did little more than\r\ncomment upon this treatise. The new art of wood engraving was turned to\r\nanatomical use and crude illustrations of the various parts of the body\r\nwere put into circulation. Some of these pictures were in the form of\r\n_Fliegende Blätter_, or flying leaves. A set of anatomical plates of\r\nthis type was issued by a certain Ricardus Hela, a physician of Paris,\r\nas early as the year 1493. They were printed at Nuremberg. Their\r\ncharacter may be judged by the accompanying illustration of the osseous\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n\r\nGabriel de Zerbi\r\n\r\nOne of Mondino’s commentators was Gabriel de Zerbi (1468-1505), of\r\nVerona, who taught medicine, logic and philosophy in the Universities of\r\nPadua, Bologna and Rome. His book, _Anatomia Corporis Humani_, appeared\r\nat Venice in 1502. Zerbi imitated Mondino in style, abbreviations and\r\nlanguage. The work, however, contains some original observations\r\nregarding the Fallopian tubes, the puncta lachrymalia and the lachrymal\r\ngland. From the fact that Zerbi describes two lachrymal glands in each\r\norbit, it is known that many of his dissections were made upon brutes.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ANATOMICAL PLATE BY RICARDUS HELA, 1493]\r\n\r\nZerbi’s reputation, which extended to all parts of Europe, was the cause\r\nof his death. The Venetians received from Constantinople the request for\r\na skillful physician who should treat one of the principal Seigniors of\r\nTurkey. The Republic turned its eyes to Zerbi who went to\r\nConstantinople, apparently cured the Seignior, and, loaded with\r\npresents, started on the return voyage for Venice, Unfortunately the\r\npatient suddenly died after a debauch. The infuriated Turks overtook the\r\nship on which Zerbi and his son were passengers and carried them back to\r\nConstantinople, where both the anatomist and his son were quartered\r\nalive.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PEYLIGK’S DIAGRAM OF THE HEART, 1499]\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Peyligk\r\n\r\nAmong the German anatomists of this period was John Peyligk, a Leipsic\r\njurist, whose _Philosophiae Naturalis Compendium_, printed at Leipsic in\r\n1499, contains crude anatomical illustrations.\r\n\r\n\r\nMagnus Hundt\r\n\r\nFar more important was the _Antropologium_ of Magnus Hundt (1449-1519),\r\nof Magdeburg, which appeared at Leipsic in 1501. It contains four large\r\nand several small woodcuts which are among the earliest of anatomical\r\nillustrations. One of these shows the trachea on the right side of the\r\nneck, passing downward to the lungs; on the left side the oesophagus is\r\nrepresented. In the thorax are seen the lungs and the heart, the latter\r\nresembling the figure of this organ as presented on old playing cards.\r\nThe pericardium has been opened, and the stomach and intestines are\r\ncrudely figured. The diaphragm is absent.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ANATOMICAL FIGURE FROM MAGNUS HUNDT, 1501]\r\n\r\n\r\nLaurentius Phryesen\r\n\r\nEarly in the sixteenth century a Holland physician, Laurentius Phryesen\r\n(_Phries_, _Friesen_), residing in the German city of Colmar and later\r\nat Metz, wrote a popular book on medicine, _Spiegel der Artzny_, which\r\nwas published at Strassburg in 1518. It contains two anatomical\r\nillustrations cut in wood, dated 1517, and supposedly made after the\r\ndrawings of Waechtlin, a pupil of the Elder Holbein. These pictures tell\r\ntheir own story; they show a marked improvement over the figures which\r\nHundt published in 1501. The other anatomical plate in Phryesen’s book\r\nis devoted to the skeleton.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ANATOMICAL FIGURE FROM LAURENTIUS PHRYESEN, 1518]\r\n\r\n\r\nAlexander Achillinus\r\n\r\nThe Italian physician Alexander Achillinus (1463-1525), professor of\r\nphilosophy and medicine in Bologna, is deserving of mention for his\r\nanatomical knowledge. Zealously devoted to the Arab medical authors,\r\nAchillinus made numerous discoveries which are set forth in his general\r\nanatomy, _De Humani Corporis Anatomica_, Venice, 1516; and in a\r\ncommentary upon Mondino’s book, _In Mundini Anatomiam Annotationes_,\r\nVenice, 1522. He discovered the duct of the sublingual gland, usually\r\ncredited to Wharton; two of the auditory ossicles, the malleus and\r\nincus; the labyrinth; the vermiform appendix; the caecum and ileo-caecal\r\nvalve; and the patheticus nerve. Portal credits him with a better\r\nknowledge of the bones and of the brain than was possessed by his\r\npredecessors.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ALEXANDER ACHILLINUS]\r\n\r\n\r\nBerengario da Carpi\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: DISSECTION BY BERENGARIO, 1535]\r\n\r\nGiacomo Berengario, Jacobus Berengarius Carpensis, also known as Carpus,\r\nwas born in the small town of Carpi, in the Duchy of Modena, in the year\r\n1470. His father, who was a surgeon, directed his studies, and for a\r\ntime he was placed under the instruction of the learned Aldus Manutius.\r\nGraduating in medicine from the University of Bologna, Berengario became\r\nnoted for his skill in surgery and anatomy. He taught these branches in\r\nPavia, and was a member of the Bologna faculty from 1502 to 1527. Then\r\nhe practiced for a time in Rome, where he amassed a fortune by the\r\ntreatment of the victims of syphilis. The last twenty years of his life\r\nwere spent in Ferrara, where he died in 1550. Berengario was one of the\r\nrestorers of anatomy. His first dissection is said to have been made in\r\nthe house of Albert Pion, Seigneur de Carpi. This demonstration was\r\ngiven publicly upon the body of a pig. Soon the anatomist turned his\r\nattention to human subjects, of which it is said that more than a\r\nhundred passed beneath his scalpel.\r\n\r\nBerengario’s later years are said by Brambilla to have been made\r\nmiserable by the machinations of the agents of the Inquisition, who\r\nobjected to some of his opinions regarding the organs of generation. He\r\nwas unjustly accused of dissecting living men—an accusation which arose\r\nfrom his statement that the surgeon should observe the anatomy of the\r\nliving body whenever it was opened by wounds or accidents.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: SKELETON BY BERENGARIO, 1523]\r\n\r\nBerengario determined to improve Mondino’s book by making corrections in\r\nthe text, and by adding suitable illustrations. No illustrations were to\r\nbe found in the early editions of Mondino, and those which were added by\r\nlater editors of the work were untrue to nature. To Berengario must be\r\ngiven the credit of furnishing some of the first anatomical\r\nillustrations that were published, and that were made from actual human\r\ndissections. These appeared in his “Commentaries of Carpus upon the\r\nAnatomy of Mundinus”, (_Carpi Commentaria super_ _Anatomia Mundini_),\r\nwhich was published at Bologna in 1521. The volume contains twenty-one\r\nplates which were cut in wood. They have been credited to the celebrated\r\nartist, Hugo da Carpi. While the drawing is somewhat coarse, the\r\nillustrations are true to nature and show a distinct advance over\r\npreceding pictures of this class. Berengario states that his plates will\r\nbe of value not only to physicians and surgeons but also to artists (_et\r\nistae figurae etiam juvant pictores in lineandis membris_). Some of his\r\nfigures are schematic; for example, those showing the abdominal muscles.\r\nSo much better are his illustrations than those of his predecessors that\r\nit may fairly be claimed that Berengario was the first author to produce\r\nan illustrated anatomy.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: MUSCLES BY BERENGARIO, 1521]\r\n\r\nBerengario also wrote a “Short Introduction to the Anatomy of the Human\r\nBody”, _Isagogae Breves in Anatomiam Humani Corporis_; and a work on\r\nFracture of the Skull.\r\n\r\nHe was the first anatomist who described the basilar part of the\r\noccipital bone, the sphenoidal sinus and the tympanic membrane.\r\nMeryon[8] credits him with the “first correct description of the great\r\nomentum (gastrocolic) and transverse mesocolon; of the caecal appendix\r\nvermiformis, of the valvulae conniventes of the intestines; of the\r\nrelative proportions of the thorax and pelvis in man and woman; of the\r\nflexor-brevis-pollicis; of the vesiculae seminales; of the separate\r\ncartilages of the larynx; of the membranous pellicle in front of the\r\nretina (attributed to Albinus); of the tricuspid valve, between the\r\nright auricle and ventricle of the heart; of the semilunar valves at the\r\ncommencement of the pulmonary artery; of the inosculation between the\r\nepigastric and mammary arteries, and an imperfect account of the cochlea\r\nof the ear”. He was the first of the mediaeval anatomists to deviate\r\nfrom the Galenic teaching in regard to the structure of the heart. He\r\ndiplomatically states that in the human subject the foramina in the\r\ncardiac septum are seen only with great difficulty (_sed in homine cum\r\nmaxima difficultate videnter_).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: MUSCLES BY BERENGARIO, 1521]\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Dryander\r\n\r\nJohn Dryander, a German physician, whose true name was Eichmann, called\r\nhimself Dryander in accordance with the custom of adopting names derived\r\nfrom the Latin or Greek languages. He was born about the year 1500 in\r\nthe Wetterau in Hesse. After obtaining proficiency in mathematics and\r\nastronomy, he went to Paris where he studied medicine for several years.\r\nReturning to Germany, he engaged in the study of practical anatomy and\r\nbecame a professor in Marburg, in which city he died in the year 1560.\r\nHe is said to have conducted the first dissections that were made in\r\nMarburg, where he taught anatomy for twenty-four years, or from 1536 to\r\n1560.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: DRYANDER]\r\n\r\nDryander, although he was a partisan of Mondino and da Carpi, and was a\r\nfierce and sometimes an unfair opponent of Vesalius, deserves to be\r\nregarded as one of the restorers of anatomy. He made several\r\nobservations upon the distinction between the cortical and the medullary\r\nportions of the brain; and was one of the earliest practical anatomists\r\nof the sixteenth century to furnish anatomical illustrations. He made\r\nimportant astronomical observations and was the inventor of several\r\nuseful instruments. He was the author of three medical works of which\r\ntwo were upon anatomy. His _Anatomia Mundini_, which was published at\r\nMarburg in 1541, contains forty-six plates, many of which have been\r\ncopied from Berengario’s work.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ANATOMICAL FIGURE BY ESTIENNE, 1545]\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles Estienne\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: SKELETON BY ESTIENNE, 1545\r\n    (Reduced one-half)]\r\n\r\nCharles Estienne, better known by the name of _Carolus Stephanus_, was a\r\nFrench anatomist whose work is worthy of remembrance. Born in the early\r\npart of the sixteenth century, he was given an excellent education. He\r\nbelonged to a noted Huguenot family of scholars and printers who have\r\nmade the Estienne name famous. Robert Estienne, the brother of Charles,\r\nbecame the victim of religious persecution; he was obliged to flee to\r\nsave his life, and for a time the publishing business was conducted by\r\nCharles Estienne. The latter also suffered for his faith; he was thrown\r\ninto a dungeon, where he died in the year 1564. Charles Estienne wrote\r\nnumerous books on literature, history, forestry and botany. His\r\nanatomical treatise, _De Dissectione Partium Corporis Humani_, appeared\r\nat Paris in 1545 with sixty-two full page plates which combine\r\nanatomical clearness, beauty of form, and artistic representation. A\r\nFrench translation of Estienne’s Anatomy was published in 1546. This\r\nwork was printed as far as the middle of the third book as early as the\r\nyear 1539: some of the plates are dated as early as 1530. The\r\nillustrations have been excellently cut in wood; many of them show the\r\nentire body, with much ornamentation, so that the proper anatomical part\r\nseems small and irrelevant. Some of the plates show the subject in\r\npicturesque and even loathsome attitudes. The text of this work is\r\nespecially valuable for the history of anatomical discovery. Although he\r\nwas an ardent Galenist, Estienne made numerous original observations in\r\nanatomy. He described the synovial glands, a discovery which has been\r\ncredited to Clopton Havers. Estienne was the first anatomist to discover\r\nthe canal in the spinal cord; he described the capsule of the liver, a\r\ntissue which bears Glisson’s name; and differentiated the eight pair\r\nfrom the sympathetic nerves. He was the first anatomist to see and\r\ndescribe the valves in the veins, which he called _apophyses venarum_—\r\ndiscovery which has been claimed for Jacobus Sylvius, Cannanus, Amatus\r\nand Fabricius.\r\n\r\nThe question of priority in the discovery of the valves of the veins\r\ngave rise to much controversy. It is reasonable to assume that these\r\nstructures were noticed independently by all of the anatomists whose\r\nnames are mentioned above.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: SKULL BY DRYANDER, 1541]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER FOURTH\r\n                         Vesalius’s Early Life\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Illuminated capital]\r\n\r\nAndreas Vesalius, or Wesalius as the family name was inscribed prior to\r\nthe year 1537, was born in Brussels on the last day of the year 1514.\r\nFrom astrological observations made by Jerome Cardan we learn that this\r\nevent occurred about six o’clock in the morning, and under favorable\r\nstellar auspices. The placenta and caul, to which popular belief\r\nascribed remarkable powers, were carefully preserved by the mother.\r\n\r\nThe Vesalius family originally was named Witing, (_Witting_, _Wytinck_,\r\n_Wytings_, according to various authorities) and adopted the name\r\nWesalius from the town of Wesel, (_Wesele_, _Vesel_), in the Duchy of\r\nCleves, which the family claimed as their native place. The three\r\nweasels (_Flemish_—“Wesel”), found in the Vesalian coat of arms, testify\r\nto this origin.\r\n\r\nIt may be said with truth that medical learning ran in the blood of the\r\nVesalius family. Andreas’s great-great-grandfather, Peter Wesalius,\r\nwrote a treatise on some of the works of Avicenna and at great cost\r\nrestored the manuscripts of several medical authors. Peter’s son, John\r\nWesalius, held the responsible position of physician to Mary of\r\nBurgundy, the first wife of Maximilian the First; in his old age John\r\ntaught medicine in the University of Louvain. From that time the\r\nVesalius family was closely associated with the Austro-Burgundian\r\ndynasty. Eberhard, son of John Wesalius, served as physician to Mary of\r\nBurgundy; he died before attaining his thirty-sixth year, and was long\r\nsurvived by his father. Eberhard, who was the grandfather of Andreas,\r\nwrote commentaries upon the books of Rhazes and on the _Aphorisms_ of\r\nHippocrates. He was also noted as a mathematician. Eberhard’s son\r\nAndreas, the father of the anatomist, was apothecary to Charles the\r\nFifth and to Margaret of Austria. He accompanied the great Emperor upon\r\nhis numerous journeys and military expeditions. In 1538 he presented\r\nAndreas’s first anatomical plates to the Emperor, and thus opened the\r\nway to the court to his son. The father remained in the imperial service\r\nuntil the day of his death, which occurred in 1546. Andreas’s mother,\r\nIsabella Crabbe, exercised a great influence upon the youth whom she\r\nbelieved to be destined to accomplish great things. She it was who\r\npreserved the manuscripts and books of the Vesalian ancestors. Isabella\r\nhappily lived long enough to see the _Fabrica_, to witness the\r\nintellectual triumph of her son, and to know of his activity at the\r\nSpanish court.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: THE OLD UNIVERSITY OF LOUVAIN\r\n    (Erected early in the Fourteenth Century. The New Building dates\r\n    from 1680)]\r\n\r\nLittle is known of the youth of Vesalius. The traditions of his\r\nancestors, their accomplishments in the field of letters and in\r\nmedicine, and their loyalty to their sovereigns, were themes which his\r\nmother must have recounted with pleasure. At an early age Andreas was\r\nsent to the neighboring city of Louvain, whose University, founded in\r\nthe year 1424, in the early part of the sixteenth century eclipsed many\r\ninstitutions of greater age, and in the number of its students ranked\r\nsecond only to the University of Paris. The theologians of Louvain were\r\nnoted for their orthodox Catholicism; from the very first days of\r\nreligious controversy they had battled strongly against the rising tide\r\nof the Reformation. Her professors of jurisprudence and of philosophy\r\nwere men of eminent talents. Within the University were four literary\r\nschools which were named _Paedagogium Castri_, _Porci_, _Lilii_, and\r\n_Falconis_, from their insignia:—a fort, a pig, a lily, and a falcon.\r\nHere also was the _Collegium trilingue Buslidianum_, which was founded\r\nby Hieronymus Busleiden (+1517) for teaching the Greek, Hebrew and Latin\r\nlanguages. Vesalius selected the _Paedagogium Castri_ which he fondly\r\nmentions in laudatory terms in his _Fabrica_. Here, and in the\r\nBusleidinian College, he obtained that thorough knowledge of ancient\r\nlanguages which, in later years, astonished his hearers and served him\r\nwell in numerous literary controversies. The names of Vesalius’s\r\nteachers are unknown, although Adam[9] states that John Winter of\r\nAndernach was his professor of Greek. Vesalius speaks scornfully of one\r\nof his teachers, a theologian, who, in trying to explain Aristotle’s _De\r\nAnima_, used a picture of the _Margarita Philosophica_ to show the\r\nstructure of the brain. Among Vesalius’s school companions were\r\nGisbertus Carbo, to whom the anatomist presented the first skeleton\r\nwhich he articulated (_Fabrica_, 1543, page 162); and the younger\r\nGranvella, who later was Chancellor to Charles the Fifth.\r\n\r\nAt an early age Vesalius possessed a desire to study the structure of\r\nthe human body. His powers of observation were precociously developed.\r\nWhen a boy, learning to swim by the aid of bladders filled with air, he\r\nnoted the elasticity of these organs, and he referred to the incident in\r\nhis _Fabrica_ (1543, page 518). When little more than a child, he tired\r\nof dialectics and tried to learn anatomy from the scholastic writings of\r\nAlbertus Magnus and of Michael Scotus. He soon discovered that the true\r\nroad to anatomical science led, not through books but through the actual\r\nhandling of the dead tissues. He began the practical study of anatomy by\r\ndissecting the bodies of mice, moles, rats, dogs and cats.[10]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER FIFTH\r\n                            Sojourn in Paris\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Illuminated capital]\r\n\r\nOne thought was uppermost in the mind of Vesalius, and that was to\r\nfollow the profession of his ancestors, just as in ancient Greece the\r\nsons of the Asclepiadae naturally adopted the vocation of their fathers.\r\nAndreas possessed an excellent preliminary education and was especially\r\nproficient in the Greek and Latin languages; he also knew something of\r\nHebrew and much of Arabic. It was in the year 1533 that the young\r\nBelgian travelled to Paris for the purpose of obtaining a medical\r\neducation. At that time the French capital was the Mecca of the medical\r\nworld—Paris, that city where classical medicine first secured support\r\n(_ubi primum medicinam prospere renasci vidimus_)[11]. In Paris, under\r\nthe leadership of Budaeus, Humanism had enjoyed a rapid growth; and here\r\nPetrus Brissotus, after gaining the doctor’s cap in the year 1514,\r\nproduced a revolution by delivering his lectures from the books of Galen\r\nin place of the treatises of Averröes and of Avicenna. At his own\r\nexpense Brissotus published Leonicenus’s translation of Galen’s _Ars\r\nCurativa_, in order that his pupils might not be misled by the incorrect\r\ntext of the Arab authors. It will be recalled that, long before this\r\ntime, classical Greek and Latin medical literature had passed through\r\nthe distorting crucible of Saracenic translations. At this period\r\nmedical science, purified from Arabic dross, was taught in a splendid\r\nmanner in Paris by such eminent professors as Jacobus Sylvius, Jean\r\nFernel, and Winter of Andernach. At their feet sat young men from the\r\nremotest parts of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe most popular of the Paris teachers was Jacobus Sylvius, or Jacques\r\nDubois, whose Latinized name is perpetuated in anatomical nomenclature.\r\nHe was born at Louville, near Amiens, in 1478. In his early years he was\r\nnoted for his scholarly attainments in the Greek, Latin and Hebrew\r\nlanguages and was the author of a French grammar. His anatomical\r\nknowledge was gained under Jean Tagault, a famous Parisian practitioner\r\nand surgical author.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: SYLVIUS]\r\n\r\nSylvius was noted for his industry, for his eloquence, and above all for\r\nhis avarice. It was the inordinate desire for money which led him to\r\nabandon philology for medicine. While studying under Tagault he began a\r\ncourse of medical lectures, explanatory of the works of Hippocrates and\r\nGalen, with such success that the Faculty of the University of Paris\r\nprotested on the score that Sylvius was not a graduate. He then went to\r\nMontpellier, whose medical professors had long held a high position,\r\nwhere, according to Astruc, he received the doctor’s cap at the end of\r\nNovember, 1529. He was then above fifty years of age. Armed with this\r\ndegree, he returned to Paris and immediately entered the lists as an\r\nindependent medical teacher, but was again halted by the Faculty who\r\nruled that he must first receive the Bachelor’s degree. This he gained\r\non June 28, 1531. Sylvius then resumed his lectures with such success\r\nthat his classes in the Collége de Tréguier numbered from four to five\r\nhundred, while Fernel, who was a professor in the Collége de\r\nCornouailles, lectured to almost empty benches. In 1550, Henry the\r\nSecond named Sylvius Professor of Medicine, as the successor of Vidus\r\nVidius, in the recently established Collége de France. Sylvius died\r\nJanuary 13, 1555, and was interred in the paupers’ cemetery as he had\r\nwished.\r\n\r\nSylvius was not only an eloquent lecturer but he was also a\r\ndemonstrative teacher. He was the first professor in France who taught\r\nanatomy from the human cadaver. In his lectures on botany he used a\r\ncollection of plants to elucidate the subject. His chief fault was a\r\nblind reverence for ancient authors. He regarded Galen’s writings as\r\ngospel; if the cadaver presented structures unlike Galen’s description,\r\nthe fault was not in the book but in the dead body, or, perchance, human\r\nstructure had changed since Galen’s time! In one of his early books[12],\r\nSylvius declared that Galen’s anatomy was infallible; that Galen’s\r\ntreatise, _De Usu Partium_, was divine; and that further progress was\r\nimpossible!\r\n\r\nThe character of Sylvius was contemptible. He was a man of vast learning\r\nand at the same time was rough, coarse and brutal. His avarice led him\r\nto endure the cold winters of Paris without the benefit of a fire; in\r\nsevere weather he would play at football, or engage in other violent\r\nexercise in his room, to save the cost of fuel. Once, and once only, did\r\nhis friends find him hilarious; they wondered and asked the cause.\r\nSylvius said he was happy because he had dismissed his “three beasts,\r\nhis mule, his cat and his maid”. He was notoriously rigid in exacting\r\nhis fees from students, and on one occasion he threatened to stop his\r\nlectures until two delinquents should pay their dues. Although he was\r\nsupposed to have amassed great wealth, little of it was found after his\r\ndeath, and these sums were secreted in secluded places. In 1616, when\r\nhis former residence in the _rue Saint-Jacques_ was demolished, numerous\r\ngold pieces were found. His reputation for miserliness followed him\r\nbeyond the grave, as witness his epitaph:\r\n\r\n  _Sylbius hic situs est, gratis qui nil dedit unquàm,_\r\n  _Mortuus et gratis quod legis ista dolet._\r\n\r\n  “Sylvius lies here, who never gave anything for nothing:\r\n  Being dead, he even grieves that you read these lines for nothing.”\r\n\r\nIn controversies he was violent and vindictive—a pastmaster in the use\r\nof bitter language. Jealous of the fame of other anatomists, he was\r\nparticularly enraged when, in later years, he was opposed by Vesalius.\r\nSylvius spoke of him not as Vesalius, but as _Vesanus_, a madman, who\r\npoisoned Europe by his impiety and clouded knowledge by his blunders.\r\nSuch was the man who, in the mid-part of the sixteenth century, filled\r\nthe position of highest honor in the Medical Faculty of the Collége de\r\nFrance[13].\r\n\r\nSylvius rendered valuable service in naming the muscles which, prior to\r\nhis time, were designated by numbers. These, says Northcote[14] “were\r\ndifferently applied by almost every author; so that it was the\r\ndescription, and not the name, that must lead one to know what part was\r\nmeant by such authors; and this required a previous thorough knowledge\r\nof anatomy”. He is the first writer who mentions colored injections and\r\nis supposed to have discovered this useful adjunct of anatomical study.\r\nHe was the first anatomist who published satisfactory descriptions of\r\nthe pterygoid and clinoid processes of the sphenoid bone, and of the os\r\nunguis. He gave a good account of the sphenoidal sinus in the adult but\r\ndenied its existence in the child, as had been affirmed by\r\nFallopius[15]. Sylvius also wrote intelligently concerning the vertebrae\r\nbut incorrectly described the sternum. His observation concerning the\r\nvalves in the veins gave rise to much discussion; the honor of priority\r\nin the discovery, however, belongs to other anatomists—Estienne and\r\nCannanus. His discoveries in cerebral anatomy have caused his name to be\r\nattached to the _aqueduct_, the _fissure_ and the _artery of Sylvius_.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which Sylvius conducted his anatomical course is known to\r\nus by his own writings, by the testimony of Moreau[16], and by that of\r\nVesalius[17]. Thus the course for the year 1535 began with the reading,\r\nby Sylvius, of Galen’s treatise _De Usu Partium_. When the middle of the\r\nfirst book was reached, Sylvius remarked that the subject was too\r\ndifficult for his students to understand and that he would not plague\r\nhis class with it. He then jumped to the fourth book, read all to the\r\ntenth book, discussed a part of the tenth and omitting the eleventh,\r\ntwelfth and thirteenth, he took up the fourteenth and the remaining\r\nthree books. Thus he omitted all that Galen had said concerning the\r\nextremities. A second Galenic work which Sylvius used was the\r\nanatomico-physiologic treatise, _De Musculorum Motu_. Not infrequently\r\nthe professor was unable to demonstrate in dissection the parts on which\r\nhe had lectured. Thus, on one occasion, the students succeeded in\r\nfinding the pulmonary and aortic valves which Sylvius had failed to find\r\non the preceding day.\r\n\r\n\r\nJoannes Guinterius of Andernach\r\n\r\nAnother famous member of the Paris Faculty of this period, and a man\r\nwhose life-story reads like a romance, was Joannes Guinterius, the\r\nbeggar of Deventer. Guinterius (Gonthier, Guinther, Guinter, Winter, or\r\nWinther), who is often called John Winter of Andernach, from the name of\r\nthe town in which he was born, lived between the years 1487-1574, and\r\nrose to eminence in both the literary and the medical worlds. Born of\r\nhumble parents, he was sent at an early age to the University of\r\nUtrecht. Leaving this institution because of his poverty, he went to\r\nDeventer where he was reduced to the necessity of begging in the\r\nstreets. He drifted to the University of Marburg, and here displayed\r\nsuch brilliant talents that he soon obtained employment as a teacher in\r\nthe small town of Goslar, in Brunswick. His growing reputation for\r\nlearning led to his appointment to the chair of Greek in the noted\r\nUniversity of Louvain.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: WINTER OF ANDERNACH]\r\n\r\nDesiring to study medicine, Guinterius went to Paris in 1525; he\r\nreceived the Bachelor’s degree in 1528, and the full medical title two\r\nyears later. He passed a brilliant examination which won for him the\r\ncommendation of the most eminent professors. Remaining in Paris, he\r\nengaged in practice and in teaching, and rapidly rose to eminence. In\r\naddition to conducting courses in anatomy, he translated into Latin the\r\nwritings of the most noted Greek medical authors of antiquity—the books\r\nof Galen, of Oribasius, of Paul of Aegina, of Caelius Aurelianus, and of\r\nAlexander of Tralles—all of which were held in high esteem in the\r\nsixteenth century. His fame reached far beyond the boundaries of France.\r\nChristian III., the enlightened king of Denmark, who was noted for his\r\nlove of literature, sought to attach him to the Danish court, but the\r\nhonor was refused. Having become a convert to the religious views of\r\nLuther, Guinterius found that his life was in danger; he left Paris and\r\nresided for a time in Metz. He soon removed to Strassburg, where he was\r\nreceived with distinguished honors and was appointed to a professorship\r\nin the University. Owing to the activity of his enemies, his position\r\nbecame insecure; accordingly, he resigned his chair and spent a\r\nconsiderable time in travelling throughout Germany and Italy. In the\r\nyear 1562, Ferdinand I., in appreciation of the great merits of\r\nGuinterius, raised him to the highest distinction by placing him among\r\nthe nobles of the land; and thus the beggar of Deventer became a\r\nnobleman of Strassburg. His life ended October 4, 1574.\r\n\r\nLike Sylvius, Guinterius was a teacher of men who became greater than\r\nhimself—Vesalius, Servetus and Rondelet sat upon his benches. Like\r\nSylvius, he placed his faith in Galen and failed to grasp the great\r\ntruth that anatomical science is based, not on the writings of the\r\nFathers but on dissection of the dead body.\r\n\r\n\r\nJean Fernel\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: JEAN FERNEL]\r\n\r\nThe third bright star of the Paris constellation was Jean Fernel\r\n(1485-1558), of Amiens, who was regarded as the ablest physiologist of\r\nhis time and was physician-in-ordinary to Henry the Second. Fernel\r\ndipped deeply into philosophy, geometry and mathematics. Before entering\r\nthe medical profession he issued three books on mathematic and geometric\r\nsubjects. He received the medical degree in 1530, but continued his\r\nstudy of mathematics with such ardor that he was almost ruined\r\nfinancially. On the advice of his friends he entered upon the practice\r\nof medicine in Paris and met with remarkable success. He was skilled in\r\nanatomy and surgery and accompanied his sovereign upon numerous military\r\nexpeditions. His medical writings are contained in many volumes and\r\nconcern a variety of subjects, such as physiology, therapeutics,\r\nsurgery, pathology, the treatment of fevers and the venereal diseases.\r\n\r\nFernel’s medical views were powerfully influenced by the teachings of an\r\nunfortunate French philosopher, Pierre de la Rameé, or Ramus, who, like\r\nmany other Protestants, lost his life on Saint Bartholomew’s Night.\r\nBrutally assassinated, his body was dragged through the streets of Paris\r\nand then was thrown into the Seine; but his system of philosophy\r\nsurvived and exercised a potent influence until it was eclipsed by the\r\ndoctrines of Descartes.\r\n\r\nRamus, who was an uncompromising opponent of the Aristotelian\r\nphilosophy, pointed out the defects and suggested the reforms in the\r\nsystem of University education. He compared the teaching of medicine\r\nwith that of theology, much to the disparagement of the latter:—“The\r\nreason”, said he, “why medicine is better taught, and the lectures are\r\nbetter attended than in theology is, that those who teach it know it,\r\nand practice it, and their disputations are chiefly on the books of\r\nHippocrates and Galen; whilst the theologians observe a strict reticence\r\non questions of the Old Testament, which they read in Hebrew, as well as\r\nof the New, which they read in Greek, but display their learning in\r\nsubtle questions respecting the pagan philosophy of Plato and\r\nAristotle”.[18] Ramus endeavored to withdraw the minds of both\r\nphysicians and medical students from the authoritative dogmas of the\r\nancient physicians and to substitute therefor the intelligent study of\r\nNature. The practical trend of his mind is shown in his suggestion that\r\ninstitutions should be arranged for clinical teaching.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: RAMUS]\r\n\r\nJust as Ramus had become an Eclectic in philosophy, so Fernel sought the\r\nbest from various sources and different medical systems. Like Ramus, he\r\ncast off the yoke which authority had placed upon him; and proposed\r\ncarefully planned principles which should lead to the discovery of\r\ntruth. Like Ramus, Fernel presented his views in a clear style and in\r\nbetter order than was to be found in the writings of his predecessors.\r\nLike Ramus, he adopted the good and rejected the bad, regardless of\r\nwhether it had been said by Aristotle, or by Galen, or by Hippocrates.\r\nFernel was a reformer who stood for freedom of thought, which, up to his\r\ntime, had suffered from the despotism of the scholastics. Although many\r\nof Fernel’s physiologic and pathologic ideas seem ridiculous when viewed\r\nin the light of modern knowledge, yet he deserves praise for daring to\r\noppose ancient dogmas, and for pointing the road to progress. In breadth\r\nof view, Fernel was far superior to Sylvius and Guinterius.\r\n\r\nThe anatomical teaching in Paris in the early part of the sixteenth\r\ncentury was far from satisfactory. There was too much lecturing and\r\ntheorizing from Galen’s texts, and too little of actual dissection.\r\nVesalius, who was not backward in his criticisms, says that the\r\ndissections were made by ignorant barbers, and during the whole time\r\nthat he was in Paris he never saw Guinterius use a knife upon a cadaver.\r\nOnly at rare intervals was a human body brought into the amphitheatre,\r\nand then the dissection lasted less than three days. It comprised only a\r\nsuperficial study of the intestines and abdominal muscles; no other\r\nmuscles were studied. The bones, veins, arteries and nerves were almost\r\nwholly ignored. The great lights of the Paris profession were totally\r\nunfit to give to the young Belgian what was his heart’s desire. They\r\nwere ignorant and knew it not. It is not surprising that, on more than\r\none occasion, Vesalius brushed the ignorant prosectors aside, took the\r\nknife into his own hands, and carried out the dissection in a systematic\r\nmanner. His zeal and learning won the admiration of Guinterius who spoke\r\nof Vesalius and Servetus in loving terms;—“first Andreas Vesalius, a\r\nyoung man, by Hercules! of singular zeal in the study of anatomy; and\r\nsecond, Michael Villanovanus (Servetus), deeply imbued with learning of\r\nevery kind, and behind none in his knowledge of the Galenic doctrine.\r\nWith the aid of these two, I have examined the muscles, veins, arteries\r\nand nerves of the whole body, and demonstrated them to the\r\nstudents”.[19]\r\n\r\nVesalius must have had many blue days in Paris—days when he longed to\r\nhave a free hand in dissection. A weaker character than his would have\r\nfitted peacefully into the established order of things, but not of such\r\nstuff was Andreas made. The difficulties which beset his path only\r\nstimulated him to work the harder; he firmly resolved to devote his\r\nenergy, his talents and his life to anatomical study and teaching. He\r\ndecided to secure the opportunity to dissect the human body and to rival\r\nthe ancient Alexandrian professors who taught the subject. “Never”, he\r\nsays, “would I have been able to accomplish my purpose in Paris, if I\r\nhad not taken the work into my own hands”. The Book of Nature which\r\nSylvius lauded, but kept his pupils from studying, was now opened by\r\nVesalius. He dissected numerous dogs and studied the only part of human\r\nanatomy that was available, namely, the bones. In his search for\r\nmaterials for a skeleton he haunted the Cemetery of the Innocents. On\r\none occasion, when he went to Montfauçon, the place where the bodies of\r\nexecuted criminals were deposited and bones were plentiful, Vesalius and\r\nhis fellow-student were attacked by fierce dogs. For a time the young\r\nanatomist was in danger of leaving his own bones to the hungry\r\nscavengers. By such dangers he gained what the Paris professors could\r\nnot supply. He became a master of the osseous system, so much so that,\r\nwhen blindfolded, he was able to name and describe any part of the\r\nskeleton which was placed in his hands. His talents were recognized by\r\nboth professors and students; and at the third anatomy which he attended\r\nin Paris he was requested to take charge of the dissection. To the\r\nsatisfaction of the students, as well as to the astonishment of the\r\nbarbers, he made an elaborate dissection of the abdominal organs and of\r\nthe muscles of the arm.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: VIVISECTION OF A PIG\r\n    (From the “Fabrica”, 1543)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER SIXTH\r\n                      Vesalius Returns to Louvain\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Illuminated capital]\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of the year 1536, owing to the outbreak of the third\r\nFranco-German war, Vesalius returned to the University of Louvain.\r\nDuring this period he secured a human skeleton by secret means.\r\nAccompanied by his faithful friend, Regnier Gemma, known as a\r\nmathematician as well as a physician, Vesalius visited the gallows\r\noutside the walls of Louvain in order to search for bones. Here he found\r\na skeleton which was held together simply by the ligaments and still\r\npossessed the origins and insertions of the muscles. Morley states that\r\nthe body was that of “a noted robber, who, since he deserved more than\r\nordinary hanging, had been chained to the top of a high stake and\r\nroasted alive. He had been roasted by a slow fire made of straw, that\r\nwas kept burning at some distance below his feet. In that way there had\r\nbeen a dish cooked for the fowls of heaven, which was regarded by them\r\nas a special dainty. The sweet flesh of the delicately roasted thief\r\nthey had preferred to any other; his bones, therefore, had been\r\nelaborately picked and there was left suspended on the stake a skeleton\r\ndissected out and cleaned by many beaks with rare precision. The\r\ndazzling skeleton, complete and clean, was lifted up on high before the\r\neyes of the anatomist, who had been striving hitherto to piece together\r\nsuch a thing out of the bones of many people, gathered as occasion\r\noffered”.\r\n\r\nSuch a prize could not be lost. With Gemma’s assistance Vesalius climbed\r\nthe gallows and secured the skeleton which he secretly conveyed to his\r\nhome. The treasure, however, was not complete; one finger, a patella and\r\na foot were missing. To this extent was Vesalius the owner of a human\r\nskeleton. In supplying the missing parts Vesalius was obliged to incur\r\nnew dangers. He stole out of the city in the nighttime, climbed the\r\ngallows unaided, searched through the mass of decaying bodies, and,\r\nhaving found the coveted bones, he stole into the city by another gate.\r\nThese secret expeditions, however, soon became unnecessary, for the\r\nBurgomaster of Louvain generously furnished an abundance of material for\r\nVesalius’s students.\r\n\r\nIt was at this period—late in the year 1536 or early in 1537—that\r\nVesalius conducted the first public anatomy that had been held in\r\nLouvain in eighteen years. He performed the dissection and lectured at\r\nthe same time, which was an innovation. Some remarks he made concerning\r\nthe seat of the soul caused him to be critised by the theologians. A\r\nfurther cause for suspicion was his association with such firm\r\nProtestants as Guinterius and Sturm of Paris; and his friendly relations\r\nwith the publisher Rescius, and the physician Velsius. Fortunately the\r\nsuspicion of heresy did not lead to any formal charges, but the affair\r\nseems to have rankled in his memory and some years later, in his\r\n_Fabrica_, he sought to clear his name of even the appearance of heresy.\r\n\r\nVesalius began his career as an author by issuing a paraphrase, or free\r\ntranslation, of the ninth book of the _Almansor_ of the celebrated\r\nRhazes[20]. This book, _liber ad Almansorem_, or work dedicated to the\r\nCaliph Al-Mansûr, was written by a learned Arab physician who lived\r\nbetween the years 860-932. The _Almansor_ consists of ten books and was\r\ndesigned by the author for a complete body or compendium of Physic. The\r\nfirst book treats of anatomy and physiology; the second, of\r\ntemperaments; the third, of food and simple medicines; the fourth, of\r\nmeans for preserving health; the fifth, of skin diseases and cosmetics;\r\nthe sixth, of diet; the seventh, of surgery; the eighth, of poisons; the\r\nninth, of treatment of all parts of the body; the tenth, or last book,\r\ndeals with the treatment of fevers. The ninth book, which Vesalius\r\ntranslated from the barbarous version into a readable form, was so\r\nhighly prized in mediaeval times that it was read publicly in the\r\nschools and was commentated by learned professors for more than a\r\nhundred years. By this publication Vesalius furnished a valuable\r\ncontribution to medical literature. The numerous marginal and\r\ninterlinear notes, which he supplied, show his intimate acquaintance\r\nwith classical literature as well as with materia medica. Vesalius\r\nemphasizes the fact that the book of Rhazes contains many remedies which\r\nwere unknown to the Greeks. The value of his edition was increased by\r\nthe presence of original drawings of the plants mentioned in the text.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER SEVENTH\r\n                     Professor of Anatomy in Padua\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Illuminated capital]\r\n\r\nShortly after the publication of his _Paraphrasis in nonum librum\r\nRhazae_, Vesalius journeyed into Italy. It was in the year 1537 that he\r\nentered the prosperous and enlightened city of Venice. Here the study of\r\nanatomy not only was not tabooed, but was encouraged, particularly by\r\nthe Theatin monks who devoted themselves to the care of the sick. At the\r\nhead of this order stood two remarkable men: J. Peter Caraffa, who later\r\nascended the papal throne as Paul IV.; and Ignatius Loyola, the founder\r\nof the Jesuits. It is a strange circumstance that two strong characters\r\nso dissimilar as were Vesalius and Loyola should meet as co-workers in\r\nthe same field. The one was filled with a thirst for anatomical\r\nknowledge, and was dreaming of the day when his _opus magnum_ should\r\nrevolutionize an important science; the other was enthused with visions\r\nof the world-wide acceptance of the doctrines of Catholicism. They met\r\nagain, in 1543—the year which marks two important events, namely, the\r\npublication of the _Fabrica_, and the full recognition of the Jesuits by\r\nthe Pope.\r\n\r\nIn Venice the young anatomist entered into various lines of activity. He\r\nexperimented with a new remedy, the China root, and besought his\r\nacquaintances to observe its effects in cases of pleurisy. He solicited\r\nanatomical material and possibly may have conducted a public\r\ndemonstration in anatomy, although this is uncertain. He practiced minor\r\nsurgery; he leeched and opened veins, particularly the popliteal vein\r\nwhich the barbers of that day did not venture to touch. In Venice he\r\nfortunately met his countryman, Jan Stephan van Calcar, who was soon to\r\nfurnish the drawings for Vesalius’s first anatomical plates.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: INSTRUMENTS USED IN DISSECTION\r\n    (From the “Fabrica”, 1543)]\r\n\r\nIn order to gain all the rights and privileges of a full-fledged\r\nphysician, Vesalius settled in Padua. On the 6th day of December, 1537,\r\nshortly after having received his degree as Doctor of Medicine, Andreas\r\nVesalius of Brussels was appointed Professor of Surgery with the right\r\nto teach Anatomy in the famous University of Padua. This, says Fisher,\r\n“was the first purely anatomical chair ever instituted”.\r\n\r\nFrom his own writings and from the manuscript notes of his loyal\r\nstudent, Vitus Tritonius, a fairly good idea of Vesalius’s teaching can\r\nbe given. The first act of the young Paduan professor was to improve the\r\ncourse in anatomy. Here, as he had done previously at Louvain, Vesalius\r\ndischarged the entire duties of the professorship. He acted as lecturer,\r\ndemonstrator and dissector. Dissatisfied with the ignorant barbers, he\r\nignored them and employed his students as assistants. He resorted to all\r\npossible means to obtain anatomical material, much of which was secured\r\nby stealth.\r\n\r\nThe aula in which Vesalius conducted his course was built of wood and\r\nwas capable of holding five hundred persons. In the centre of the room\r\nwas a table under which was a receptacle containing bones and joints. An\r\narticulated skeleton was placed in an upright position at one end of the\r\ntable. In this elegantly appointed room, before an audience of\r\ndistinguished laymen and students, the instruction in anatomy was given.\r\nThe course was a strenuous one, occupying practically the entire day for\r\na period of three weeks, and comprising not only human but also much\r\ncomparative anatomy. The vivisection of dogs, pigs, and rarely of cats,\r\nwas a regular part of the course. Drawings were used to elucidate the\r\nrelations between the skeleton and the soft parts; and frequently\r\nVesalius marked the outlines of the joints upon the skin of the subject.\r\nHe also marked the cranial sutures with ink. His anatomical charts were\r\nthe work of his own hand; at times he drew the pictures in the presence\r\nof his audience. His dissections were made with extreme neatness and\r\ndexterity. He used but few instruments and these were of the simplest\r\nkind: knives of different shapes, hooks, cannula, catheter, sounds,\r\nbristles, hammer, saw, needles, thread and a sponge. Forceps and\r\ninjection apparatus were not used; he rarely used scissors. Much of the\r\nactual separation of tissues was done by the aid of the finger-nails. A\r\nvivisection board completed the list _de instrumentis quae anatomes\r\nstudioso debent esse ad manum_.\r\n\r\nLet us now follow one Vesalius’s public courses in anatomy. It is the\r\nmonth of December, in the year 1537. The report has spread that the\r\nyoung Belgian professor will begin his course. Long before the hour set\r\nfor the lecture, every available seat has been taken and many persons\r\nare standing. An audience comprising the professors of the University,\r\nthe students of medicine, officials of the city of Padua, and learned\r\npersons of all ranks, including members of the clergy, numbering more\r\nthan five hundred persons, has assembled to do honor to the professor of\r\nanatomy.\r\n\r\nVesalius comes into the arena and walks to the table which is closely\r\nsurrounded by his auditors. He wastes no time; after a few preliminary\r\nremarks on the importance of anatomy and the methods of acquiring a\r\nknowledge of this science, he launches into the practical demonstration.\r\nAfter rapidly pointing out the divisions of the body, and demonstrating\r\nthe skin, joints, cartilages, ligaments, glands, fat and muscles, he\r\npasses to the more complex parts, all of which are shown upon the\r\nskinned body of a dog or of a lamb, in order to conserve the human\r\nmaterial. Now the human cadaver is placed on the table; all eyes are\r\nturned upon it, for such a demonstration occurs only at long intervals.\r\nVesalius speaks first of the difference in the structure of joints at\r\ndifferent ages and in different sexes, illustrating his remarks by means\r\nof drawings and by an abundant supply of bones of man and of the lower\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nNow comes the dissection. This is made rapidly and in regular order. Its\r\ncourse depends upon the amount of material at hand; if the professor\r\nresorts to two bodies, as in the year 1538, the demonstration is handled\r\nin grand style. Vesalius uses the first body for a comprehensive\r\nexamination of the muscles, ligaments and viscera; whilst the second\r\ncadaver is devoted to the relations of the veins, arteries, nerves and\r\nviscera. The text of the _Fabrica_ is written according to this plan of\r\npublic dissection.\r\n\r\nAt times Vesalius attempted to teach the whole of anatomy on one\r\ncadaver. In this event, osteology was followed by the dissection of the\r\nabdominal muscles layer by layer, the demonstration closing with an\r\nexamination of the entire contents of the abdomen. The pelvic organs\r\nwere reached by incision and separation of the symphysis pubis. If the\r\ncadaver was that of a female, the dissection began with the mammary\r\nglands and then passed to the inferior venter. In pregnancy the foetal\r\nmembranes were removed intact, and were placed in a vessel filled with\r\nwater. The foetus was opened and its anastomosing vessels were found.\r\nFor demonstrating the cotyledons, the uterus of a sheep or goat was\r\nused. After the thorax had been raised by means of a log or brick,\r\nVesalius passed to the face and the anterior part of the neck, freely\r\nexposing the muscles on one side and the vessels and nerves on the\r\nother. Then followed the unilateral preparation of the muscles of the\r\nshoulder and back, then those of the mouth, which were approached by\r\nmeans of division of the lower jaw; and, finally, the pharynx and the\r\nlarynx were exposed. The rectus anticus muscle was next brought into\r\nview, whereupon Vesalius detached the head from the vertebral column.\r\nDecapitation was followed by an examination of the cranium; the\r\nskull-cap was sawed and the brain was dissected in its natural position.\r\nThen came the examination of the eye, which Vesalius dissected in two\r\nways: either by a complete section, or layer by layer from without\r\ninwards.\r\n\r\nThe ear and the cavities of the frontal and sphenoidal bones were next\r\nopened, provided these bones were not needed for the setting up of a\r\nskeleton. Finally he took up the extremities, demonstrating the muscles\r\nof an arm and a leg on one side, and the nerves and vessels on the\r\nother. The anatomy lesson ended with the introduction of numerous\r\nvivisections.\r\n\r\nVesalius could not entirely escape disputations, but he gave to them a\r\nclose anatomic basis. Theoretical physiology was repugnant to him; for\r\nhim physiology was not speculation but the sequel of anatomic research.\r\nIf he at times gave free reign to his views, he indicated them as mere\r\ntheories. He did not ignore pathologic conditions, but he handled them\r\nas briefly as possible. Fearing to tire his audience with too much\r\nvariety, he confined his students closely to the structure of the human\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nThe merit of Vesalius’s public dissections, and the impression which\r\nthey made upon his auditors, can be appreciated only by comparison with\r\nsimilar demonstrations made by his predecessors. The large and\r\nenlightened audience remained day by day for a period of three or four\r\nweeks. He says not a word about the physical and mental strain incident\r\nto such a strenuous course, in which his entire time was employed. The\r\ncourses brought great financial profit to the professor.\r\n\r\nOn two occasions, probably in the years 1539 and 1540, Vesalius was\r\ncalled from Padua to Bologna to conduct public dissections. This was a\r\ngreat honor, for Bologna was the city in which Mondino had revived the\r\npractical teaching of anatomy. These courses were conducted by Vesalius\r\nin a wooden building erected for that particular purpose. Here, as in\r\nPadua, the professor acted as demonstrator and lecturer, remaining in\r\nthis ancient city for a period of several weeks. On the first occasion\r\nhe was supplied with three human bodies and was enabled to handle the\r\nsubject in grand style. At the first séance he engaged with the\r\ncelebrated Professor Matthaeus Curtius, whose acquaintance he had made\r\nin 1538 while on a vacation trip, in a deep study of the question of\r\nvenesection. Before a large and select assembly he demonstrated in all\r\nthree bodies that Galen’s description of the vena azygos was incorrect.\r\nOn the second convocation Vesalius seems to have disposed of more\r\nbodies. He reviewed Galen’s work on the joints, and by numerous\r\nspecimens, which were prepared by the students, he demonstrated the\r\ndifference in the ancient knowledge of the skeleton. On this occasion he\r\nundertook the complete dissection of an ape and presented its skeleton,\r\nas well as that of a man, to Professor John Andreas Albius, who held the\r\nchair of Hippocratic medicine in Bologna.\r\n\r\nLittle is known of the way in which Vesalius taught surgery. The first\r\nyear he was in Padua, he began with Avicenna’s treatise on tumors.\r\nAccording to the fragmentary notes in the college book of his ardent\r\npupil, Vitus Tritonius, Vesalius compared Avicenna’s teachings with the\r\nclassical works of Hippocrates, Galen, Paul of Aegina, and Aetius,\r\nexplaining and correcting them.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: INITIAL LETTER BY VESALIUS\r\n    (From the “Fabrica”, 1543)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER EIGHTH\r\n                     First Contribution to Anatomy\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Illuminated capital]\r\n\r\nLike all great teachers, Vesalius was ever mindful of the interests of\r\nhis students. Soon after accepting the chair of Anatomy in Padua, he\r\narticulated a human skeleton for use in his class room. His next work\r\nwas the preparation of a set of anatomical plates, _Tabulae Anatomicae_,\r\nwhich were intended to pave the way to anatomy for beginners. For the\r\nfurther benefit of his class, he edited an edition of Guinterius’s\r\n_Institutionuin Anatomicarum_, which was issued in April, 1538.\r\n\r\n\r\nTabulae Anatomicae\r\n\r\nThe _Tabulae Anatomicae_ were in the form of _Fliegende Blätter_, or\r\nloose leaves, and consisted of six plates which are now among the rarest\r\nof medical works. They bore the following title:\r\n\r\n        _Tabulae Anatomicae. Imprimebat Venetiis B(ernardinus).\r\n               Vitalis Venetus sumptibus Joannis Stephani\r\n                 Calcarensis Prostrant verò in officina\r\n                        D. Bernardini. a. 1538._\r\n\r\nIn the preface Vesalius says that no one can learn either botany or\r\nanatomy from figures alone, but illustrations are a valuable means\r\ntoward the imparting of knowledge. In publishing these plates he hopes\r\nto benefit those persons who had attended his public dissections. Not a\r\nline in these pictures is unnatural; all has been reproduced just as he\r\nhad shown in his demonstrations. He gives due credit to van Calcar, the\r\nartist who made the drawings of the three skeletons. The other pictures\r\nwere made by the author himself.\r\n\r\nThe _Tabulae Anatomicae_ were arranged in the following order:—\r\n\r\n  I.—The Portal System and the Organs of Generation;\r\n  II.—The Venae Cavae and Chief Veins;\r\n  III.—The Great Artery—Arteria Magna—and the Heart;\r\n  IV.—The Skeleton in its Anterior View;\r\n  V.—The Skeleton in its Side View;\r\n  VI.—The Skeleton in its Posterior View.\r\n\r\nThe plates are of large dimensions, measuring over sixteen inches in\r\nlength, and were cut in wood. Like those in the _Fabrica_, they were\r\nmade in Italy. Owing to their transient use by medical students, the\r\n_Tabulae_ were soon destroyed, although unauthorized editions were\r\nprinted in several cities. The book was dedicated to Narcissus of\r\nParthenope (Narciso Verdunno, or Vertuneo) who, in 1520, was first\r\nphysician to the crown of Naples, and later, in 1524, was physician and\r\ncouncilor to Charles the Fifth. It is noteworthy that three of these\r\nplates deal with the skeleton, a subject to which Vesalius had given\r\nmuch attention. The absence of a plate showing the nervous system is\r\nalso to be noted. Vesalius had such a plate prepared, and it appeared in\r\na pirated edition of the _Tabulae_ which was published at Cologne in\r\n1539. The large size of these plates, their fidelity to nature, and the\r\nskill with which they were cut in wood, were features which showed to\r\nthe world that a real master of anatomy had been born. The original\r\ndrawings were made by Jan Stephan van Calcar, who probably also was the\r\nengraver.\r\n\r\nOnly two copies of the _Tabulae Anatomicae_ are known. A fine edition of\r\nthese plates, reproduced by photography, was privately issued in 1874 by\r\nSir William Stirling-Maxwell, the talented author of the _Annals of the\r\nArtists of Spain_.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: VIEW OF THE CITY OF BASEL IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER NINTH\r\n                       Publication of the Fabrica\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Illuminated capital]\r\n\r\nOn the first day of August, 1542, after three years of strenuous labor,\r\nVesalius completed the _Fabrica_, and twelve days later he wrote the\r\nlast word of the _Epitome_. The blocks for the _Fabrica_, and also those\r\nfor the _Epitome_, were made in Italy. In the summer of 1542 they were\r\nconveyed to Basel by a merchant named Danoni and were safely delivered\r\nto the printer, Oporinus. They were accompanied by a long Latin letter,\r\nwritten by Vesalius to his friend, “Joannes Oporinus, professor of Greek\r\nletters in Basel”. He begs Oporinus to take the greatest care that the\r\nprinted illustrations shall correspond with the proofs which accompany\r\nthe blocks. “Every detail must be distinctly visible, so that each cut\r\nshall have the effect of a picture”. Early in the following year\r\nVesalius went to Basel to superintend the printing of his books. While\r\nthere, he conducted a demonstration in anatomy—the first which had\r\noccurred in that city since 1531—and presented the articulated skeleton\r\nof the subject to the University. Part of this skeleton exists today. It\r\nis thought to be the oldest anatomical preparation in existence.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fabrica\r\n\r\nThe heart of Vesalius must have filled with joy when he saw the final\r\npage of his book turned from the press. The treatise which founded\r\nmodern anatomy bears this title:—\r\n\r\n            _Andreae Desalii Brurellensis, Scholae medicorum\r\n               Patabinae professoris, de humani corporis\r\n                    fabrica Libri septem. Basileae._\r\n                                MDXLIII\r\n\r\nA fortune was lavished upon the illustration and publication of this\r\ngrand work. To use the words of Fisher, “it was and is a glorious book,\r\na rare and precious monument of genius, industry and liberality”. It\r\nabounds with curious initial letters bearing quaint and interesting\r\nanatomical conceits, each one teaching its lesson. One of these, reduced\r\nin size, introduces the present chapter; and it was this letter that\r\nVesalius used in his opening sentence: _Os caeterarum hominis partium\r\nest durissimum & ardissimum, maximaque terrestre & frigidum, & sensus\r\ndenique praeter solos dentes expers._\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: JOANNES OPORINUS]\r\n\r\nThe first edition of the _Fabrica_ is a folio volume with magnificent\r\nillustrations on wood, all carefully printed by Joannes Oporinus\r\n(1507-1568) of Basel.\r\n\r\nThe title-page is a beautiful engraving which represents Vesalius at\r\nwork dissecting a female subject. He is surrounded by interested\r\nspectators who crowd the amphitheatre. The abdomen of the subject is\r\nopened. Vesalius has raised his left hand; his right hand grasps a small\r\nrod which rests on the viscera. The great teacher is talking to his\r\npupils. Placed at the head of the dissecting table is an upright\r\nskeleton which grasps a long staff with its right hand. In the audience\r\nare many persons of different rank. To the left a naked man is climbing\r\na pillar, while to the right, and below, a dog is being brought into the\r\narena. To the left, and below, is a monkey which appears to enjoy the\r\ndemonstration. Above, in the architecture, we see the monogram of the\r\npublisher, Oporinus; in the centre, on a shield, are the three weasels\r\nof the Vesalius family, and below, is a shield which bears the\r\nprivilegium. This old engraving is one of the most spirited and\r\nelaborate to be found in the whole range of medical literature. In the\r\n1725 edition, for which Jan Wandelaar made copperplate reproductions of\r\nthe original figures, the title-page is altered:—the monogram of\r\nOporinus is absent and the architecture is slightly changed.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: MARK OF OPORINUS]\r\n\r\nWho was the unnamed artist? It is noteworthy that Vesalius does not\r\nstate who drew the illustrations, or who cut them in wood, for his\r\n_Fabrica_. He only states that this book has cost him a monstrous amount\r\nof labor in the preparation of the dissections, and in the directing of\r\nthe eye, the hand, and the intelligence of the artist. He complains\r\nbitterly of the obstinacy of the artist, who, at times so tormented him\r\nthat he—Vesalius—considered himself more unfortunate than the criminal\r\nwhose body had been dissected[21]. It was probably owing to this\r\nunpleasant experience that Vesalius omitted the artist’s name. The great\r\nanatomist speaks regretfully of the large sums which he was obliged to\r\npay, in order to induce skilled artists to undertake this class of work.\r\nHe states that they were much more interested in painting Venus and The\r\nGraces than in drawing pictures of skinned and foul smelling bodies.\r\nMoehsen[22] assumes that Vesalius had Titian in mind when he penned\r\nthese thoughts, but this is questionable. It is not surprising that\r\neminent artists should have disliked anatomical drawing, at a time when\r\nantiseptic injections and preserving fluids were not known. Foul odors\r\nhad no terrors for the great Belgian, who haunted cemeteries for\r\nanatomical material and often kept parts of cadavers in his bedchamber\r\nfor weeks at a time.\r\n\r\nFor a period of two centuries the Vesalian pictures were ascribed to\r\nTitian, but on insufficient grounds. The famous Venetian painter was\r\nover sixty years of age at the time of the publication of the _Fabrica_;\r\nhis services were much in demand, and he was signally honored by the\r\nSpanish emperor, Charles the Fifth. His powers remained undiminished\r\nuntil shortly before his death, which occurred in 1576. He had the\r\nability to make the Vesalian illustrations, but it is doubtful if he had\r\nthe time. Although Titian may have taken an interest in these anatomical\r\nplates, it is not now believed that he drew them.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: JAN STEPHAN VAN CALCAR]\r\n\r\nThe Vesalian pictures have been attributed to Christoforo Coriolano; but\r\nhe could not have been the artist, since his earliest work dates from\r\n1568. He is known to have furnished the drawings for Jerome\r\nMercurialis’s _De Arte Gymnastica_, and for Vasari’s _Lives of the\r\nPainters_. Roth is of the opinion that Vesalius himself made most of the\r\nillustrations; but such a view would credit the comparatively short and\r\nbusy life of the great anatomist with too much accomplishment.\r\n\r\nI conclude that the illustrations for the _Fabrica_, like the osseous\r\nfigures in the _Tabulae Anatomicae_, which Vesalius issued in 1538, were\r\nmade by Jan Stephan van Calcar (+1546), the favorite pupil of Titian.\r\nSandrart[23] states that van Calcar made the drawings for the _Fabrica_;\r\nthat he went to Venice in 1536 or 1537; that he studied under Titian;\r\nand that his paintings were of such merit that they were often mistaken\r\nfor those of Titian, Raphael, and Rubens.\r\n\r\nVan Calcar was a Fleming, a native of Kalcker in the Duchy of Cleves.\r\nThe date of his birth is not known. His death occurred at Naples in\r\n1546. He was highly esteemed by Vesalius who speaks of him as ranking\r\n“with the divine and happy wits of Italy”. The anatomical plates which\r\nVesalius issued in 1538 were made, he states, by van Calcar:—_sumptibus\r\nJoannis Stephani Calcarensis_. These plates, which appeared in the form\r\nof pictorial broad sheets, or _Fliegende Blätter_, may be likened to the\r\nHerald who goes in advance to announce the coming of the King. They were\r\nengraved on wood, and, like their companion pictures in the _Fabrica_,\r\nthey were unprecedented in magnitude and in minuteness.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: SECOND VESALIAN PLATE OF THE MUSCLES\r\n    (From the “Fabrica”, 1543. Reduced one-half)]\r\n\r\nThe Vesalian plates vary greatly in merit. The most satisfactory ones\r\nare those depicting the undissected body and the bones and muscles. The\r\nartist was not at his best in drawing the nervous system, although it is\r\nclaimed that Vesalius had prepared his neurologic specimens with great\r\ncare. For the use of artists, the best plates are the three skeletons\r\nand the four entire myologic figures in the _Fabrica_. The first\r\nmyologic figure, showing a man who has been divested of all skin, fat,\r\nand superficial fascia, presents the muscles of the anterior portion of\r\nthe body beautifully delineated. Vesalius took much pride in this plate,\r\nand directed the attention of artists to it. The second plate, which is\r\nconstructed along similar lines, shows the body in its lateral aspect.\r\nThe head is thrown slightly backward, the right hand pointing to the\r\nearth and the left raised towards the horizon, and the whole attitude of\r\nthe subject calls to mind the position which an orator would assume when\r\naddressing an audience. The third myologic plate is similar to the first\r\none, but the muscles of the face are exhibited to better advantage and\r\nthe aponeuroses, absent in the first plate, are here present. The fourth\r\nplate, which is the ninth in Vesalius’s work (_nona musculorum tabula_),\r\npresents the muscles of the posterior part of the body. The other\r\nmyologic figures show the deeper muscles, layer by layer, and are of\r\nvalue to an artist who wishes to study the effect of their action upon\r\nthe superficial parts of the body. Hence many of these figures have been\r\nreproduced in works on art-anatomy. The artist who studies these plates\r\nshould remember that the figures in question are divested of skin, fat,\r\nand superficial veins—all of which must be supplied, in order to avoid\r\ngiving too great prominence to the muscles. The two naked figures\r\ncontained in the _Epitome_ are properly clothed in skin and are of great\r\nartistic merit. They also are to be seen in numerous works on\r\nart-anatomy. Thus, in one of the earliest books on anatomy for the use\r\nof artists (_Abrégé d’anatomie accommodé aux arts de peinture et de\r\nsculpture._ Paris, 1667, 1668), Rogers de Piles and François Tortebat\r\nhave used the three skeletons and seven myologic figures taken from the\r\n_Fabrica_ and the _Epitome_. In the preface of his book, de Piles says\r\nthat he does not think it is possible to produce better figures than\r\nthose found in the works of Vesalius. That he was not alone in this\r\nopinion is shown by the fact that many other artists, who have composed\r\ntreatises on art-anatomy, have drawn freely from the Vesalian\r\nstorehouse. An Italian, Giacomo Moro, in his anatomy for the use of\r\nartists, (_Anatomia ridotta ad uso de’ pittori e scultore._ Venice\r\n1679), reproduced nineteen of Vesalius’s figures in copperplate.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: NINTH VESALIAN PLATE, OF THE MUSCLES\r\n    (From the “Fabrica”, 1543. Reduced one-half)]\r\n\r\nThe popularity of Vesalius’s anatomical figures among painters was due,\r\nnot only to the intrinsic worth of these illustrations, but also to the\r\nerroneous belief that the original drawings were the work of Titian.\r\nThis opinion found expression on the title-pages of several works on\r\nart-anatomy. For example, in 1706, Moschenbauer, of Augsburg, issued a\r\nfolio volume illustrated with Vesalian figures cut in wood, with this\r\ntitle:—_Andreae Vesalii, Bruxellensis, des ersten besten Anatomici,\r\nZergliederung des menschlichen Körpers auf Mahlerey, and Bildhauer-Kunst\r\ngerichtet, die Figuren von Titian gezeichnet_. An anonymous book,\r\n_Notomia di Titanio_, appeared in Italy about the year 1670.\r\n\r\nThe Vesalian figures of the skeleton were also issued in single sheets\r\nwith moralistic verses appended. Moehsen cites one of these with the\r\ninscription printed in French:\r\n\r\n  “De cet objet affreux tu parois rebutté,\r\n  Est c’est ce que dans peu cependant tu dois étre:\r\n  Apprens, mortel, a te connoître\r\n  Ce miroir est le seul, ou tu n’est point flatté”.\r\n\r\nAnother legend reminds the reader that he is only dust, and to dust he\r\nmust return:—“_Vous estes poudre, & vous retournéres en poudre_”.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: A HUMAN SKULL RESTING ON THE SKULL OF A DOG\r\n    (From the “Fabrica”, 1543)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER TENTH\r\n                       Publication of the Epitome\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Illuminated capital]\r\n\r\nUpon the thirteenth day of August, 1542, Vesalius finished the _Epitome_\r\nof his great book. The text and illustrations for it were forwarded to\r\nBasel by the same merchant who conveyed the manuscript and drawings of\r\nthe _Fabrica_. The title of the lesser work is as follows:—\r\n\r\n            _Andreae Vesalii Bruxellensis, Scholae medicorum\r\n            Patavinae professoris, suorum de Humani corporis\r\n             fabrica librorum Epitome. Basil., et officina\r\n               Joannis Oporini, Anno, 1543, mense Junio._\r\n\r\nThis work is extremely rare. It belonged to the class of _Fliegende\r\nBlätter_ and was issued unbound. Perfect copies of it are rarely found.\r\nThe first twelve sheets are printed on both sides; the two last leaves\r\nare printed on one side only, in order that they might be cut out and\r\npasted together to show two complete figures. Hence these sheets are\r\noften lacking. The _Epitome_ appeared in the same year and in the same\r\nmonth as the _Fabrica_, but the latter work was printed first.\r\n\r\nThe _Epitome_ is dedicated to Philip, the son of Charles the Fifth, who,\r\nafter his father’s abdication, was known as Philip the Second of Spain.\r\nThe title-page is printed from the same plate as the larger work; and\r\nVesalius’s portrait also is present. From the fact that the dedication\r\nbears the inscription: _Patavii, idibus Augusti 1542_, the erroneous\r\nopinion arose that this work preceded the _Fabrica_.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: TITLE-PAGE OF VESALIUS’S “EPITOME”, 1543]\r\n\r\nAmong the illustrations found in the _Epitome_ are seven that are not in\r\nthe large book; namely, five myologic plates, and the figure of a naked\r\nman and one of a woman. The myologic figures in the _Epitome_ differ\r\nfrom those in the _Fabrica_ in this respect: the muscles are drawn in\r\ntheir natural position, group, and order, so that the surgeon, in\r\ntreating wounds and in performing operations, may have the correct\r\nrelations of the parts in mind. Also, the one side of the figure differs\r\nfrom the other: the one showing the superficial muscles, while the other\r\nexhibits the deeper musculature. The muscles in the _Fabrica_, with the\r\nexception of four complete myologic figures, are represented as they\r\nappear in anatomical demonstrations, particular attention being given to\r\ntheir origins and insertions. For the purpose of the artist, the best\r\nfigures are the three skeletons and the four complete myologic figures\r\nwhich are found in the _Fabrica_.\r\n\r\nTwo beautiful copies of the _Epitome_, printed on vellum, are in\r\nexistence. One is in the British Museum and is thought to be the copy\r\nwhich was owned by the celebrated Dr. Richard Mead; the other one is in\r\nthe possession of the University of Louvain.\r\n\r\nVesalius speaks modestly of the _Epitome_, which he regards as an index\r\nor appendix of the _Fabrica_, and is for the use of beginners in\r\nanatomy.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: SKELETON BY VESALIUS\r\n    (From the “Fabrica”, 1543. Reduced one-half)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER ELEVENTH\r\n                        Contents of the Fabrica\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Illuminated capital]\r\n\r\nThe reputation of Vesalius rests securely upon the _Fabrica_. This grand\r\nbook, which is dedicated to Charles the Fifth, consists of six hundred\r\nand fifty-nine folio pages of text; thirty-four pages of index, disposed\r\nin three columns to the page; six pages of preface; and two pages of a\r\nletter which is addressed to “Joannes Oporinus, the renowned professor\r\nof Greek letters in Basel”. The work is printed in excellent style. The\r\nprinted page measures 8 by 12½ inches, including the marginal notes.\r\nThere are fifty-seven lines to a page, averaging twelve words to a line,\r\nor approximately seven hundred words to a page. This was written, amid\r\nmany duties and distractions, in the short period of three years. It is\r\ntruly a monument of diligence.\r\n\r\nThe text of the _Fabrica_ is clear and concise; it describes what has to\r\nbe described and does it well. The errors which Vesalius rectified, and\r\nthe improvements which he made in anatomy, are so numerous that\r\nreferences can be made to only a few of them. His anatomical writings\r\nare of such bulk that they cannot be reviewed adequately within the\r\nlimits of the present chapter. As regards the _Fabrica_, we may say,\r\nwith Richardson, that “The dissections and the plates are the book”.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIFTH VESALIAN PLATE OF THE MUSCLES\r\n    (From the “Fabrica”, 1543. Reduced one-half)]\r\n\r\nThe _Fabrica_ contains the rudiments of anthropology as well as the\r\nfirst illustrations of comparative anatomy. Vesalius portrays a human\r\nskull resting upon the skull of a dog. He also shows a simian and a\r\ncanine sacrum and coccyx, to prove his contention that Galen’s anatomy\r\nwas derived from dissection of the lower animals. The _Fabrica_ is more\r\nthan an anatomy. Throughout the work physiology goes hand in hand with\r\nthe anatomical description. The use and function of each part of the\r\nbody is given in short, clear sentences.\r\n\r\nThe _Fabrica_ is built upon a practical plan. It treats of anatomy in a\r\nlogical manner and is composed of seven books, which deal with the\r\nfollowing subjects: (1)—Bones and Cartilages; (2)—Ligaments and Muscles;\r\n(3)—Veins and Arteries; (4)—Nerves; (5)—Organs of Nutrition and\r\nGeneration; (6)—Heart and Lungs; and (7)—Brain and Organs of Sense.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe First Book\r\n\r\nVesalius devotes one hundred and sixty-eight pages to the bones and\r\ncartilages, treating these structures with a thoroughness that amazed\r\nhis contemporaries. He was the first author who correctly described the\r\nosseous system as a whole. In numerous instances Vesalius places himself\r\nin direct opposition to the opinions of Galen. He denied the existence\r\nof the intermaxillary bone in adults, and showed that the inferior\r\nmaxilla does not consist of two pieces, as has been asserted by Galen.\r\nThe seven bones of the sternum were reduced to three by Vesalius. He\r\ndenied Galen’s statement that the bones of the symphysis pubis separate\r\nduring parturition. He was the first anatomist to give an accurate\r\ndescription of the sphenoid bone. A small aperture at the root of the\r\npterygoid process of the sphenoid bone is called _foramen Vesalii_.\r\nVesalius proved the existence of marrow in the bones of the hand, which\r\nhad been denied by Galen. In all respects, he wrote more intelligently\r\nof the bones than any anatomist who had preceded him.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: DEEP MUSCLES OF THE BACK BY VESALIUS\r\n    (From the “Fabrica”, 1543. Reduced one-half)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PART OF THE FIRST TEXT-PAGE OF THE “FABRICA”]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Second Book\r\n\r\nVesalius devotes one hundred and eighty-eight pages to a description of\r\nthe ligaments and the muscles. This part of his treatise, while it\r\ncontains a few errors and does not reach the high plane of the first\r\nbook, is superior to any work of its kind that had preceded it. Vesalius\r\nwas the first writer to describe the internal pterygoid muscle. He\r\ndenied the existence of a general muscle of the skin, and stated that\r\nthe intercostal muscles merely separate the ribs without expanding or\r\ncontracting the thorax. He held the view that nerves and muscles do not\r\nstand in any relation of proportionate strength to one another, large\r\nnerves often being distributed to small muscles. He also held that the\r\ntendons are similar in structure to the ligaments.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PLATE OF THE ARTERIAL TREE BY VESALIUS\r\n    (From the “Fabrica”, 1543. Reduced one-half)]\r\n\r\nVesalius’s plates of the superficial muscles are among the most\r\nbeautiful that have ever appeared. They have been copied in practically\r\nall later treatises on anatomy, and have been used extensively by\r\nart-anatomists. His plates of the deeper muscles, while naturally not so\r\npleasing to the eye, are wonderfully near accuracy. The different\r\nmuscles are drawn to show function as well as structure.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Third Book\r\n\r\nThe third part of the _Fabrica_, comprising sixty pages, is devoted to\r\nthe veins and arteries. Vesalius begins with the definition of a vein,\r\nand describes the structure of these vessels in general. The term\r\n“artery” is treated in like manner. He introduces several small\r\nillustrations which serve to elucidate this part of the text. His first\r\nlarge plate in this section is devoted to the venae portae. This is\r\nfollowed by a full-page picture of the entire venous system. The\r\narterial system is fully described and elaborately illustrated. To these\r\nis added another plate, in which both arteries and veins are represented\r\nin their natural order. In other plates he shows the special\r\ncirculations—cerebral, portal, and pulmonary.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN BY VESALIUS\r\n    (From the “Fabrica”, 1543)]\r\n\r\nVesalius described the valve which guards the foramen ovale in the\r\nfoetus, and also noticed the valve-like fold which guards the entrance\r\nof each hepatic vein into the inferior vena cava. He also gave an\r\nadmirable description of the vena azygos. Blinded by the ancient theory\r\nof the movement of the blood—a sort of flux and reflux in the veins, he\r\noverlooked the function of the venous valves. He described them as\r\neminences, or projections, or accidental rugosities, which in no way\r\ninterfere with the flux and reflux of the blood.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: DISSECTION OF THE HEART BY VESALIUS\r\n    (From the “Fabrica”, 1543)]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fourth Book\r\n\r\nVesalius devotes forty pages to the cerebral and spinal nerves. The\r\nanatomy of the brain is treated in the seventh book. His representations\r\nof the nerves are very creditable. He mentions eleven pairs of cranial\r\nnerves: the olfactory, the optic, the motores oculorum, the trifacial,\r\nthe abducens, the portio dura, the portio mollis, the glosso-pharyngeal,\r\nthe pneumogastric, and the spinal accessory.\r\n\r\nHis account of the brain—contained in the seventh book—is elaborately\r\nminute considering the time when it was written. His illustrations and\r\ndescription of this organ surpass those of scores of later authors.\r\nVesalius fully describes the position of the brain; the membranes which\r\ncover it; the cavities, or ventricles, within it; the divisions of\r\ncerebrum, cerebellum, and medulla; the anatomy of the base, and the\r\norigins of the cerebral nerves. These structures are illustrated from\r\ndifferent points of view.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fifth Book\r\n\r\nThe fifth book, comprising more than one hundred pages, is devoted to\r\nthe organs of nutrition. Here we find an admirable account of the\r\nperitoneum, the mesentery, the omentum, the stomach and intestines, the\r\nliver, the spleen, and the genito-urinary tract—all of which structures\r\nare described and fully illustrated. In this book Vesalius also\r\ndescribes the foetus in utero.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sixth Book\r\n\r\nIn less than fifty pages Vesalius describes the contents of the thorax.\r\nHe writes intelligently of the membrane lining the thorax, and then\r\ngives an account of the arteria aspera, as the trachea was formerly\r\nnamed. Passing on to the lungs, he next takes up the anatomy of the\r\nheart. He describes its position, form, and structure in better terms\r\nthan had been done by preceding anatomists. The auricles, ventricles,\r\nand valves are carefully examined. His illustrations of both lungs and\r\nheart are excellent.\r\n\r\nIn the 1543 edition of the _Fabrica_, Vesalius adopts the erroneous view\r\nof Galen that openings exist in the septum of the heart. In the second\r\nedition of his book, published in 1555, he says that influenced by the\r\nviews of Galen, he believed that the blood passes from the right to the\r\nleft ventricle of the heart, through the septum, by means of the pores.\r\nVesalius immediately adds that the septum of the heart is as dense and\r\ncompact as the rest of this organ, and that not the smallest quantity of\r\nblood passes through the septum.\r\n\r\nHis account of this subject is best given in his own words:—“In\r\nrecounting as above the structure of the heart, and the use of its\r\ndifferent parts, I have followed in the main the doctrines of Galen; not\r\nthat I regard them in all particulars as consonant with the truth, but\r\nbecause, in attributing new functions and uses to a number of parts, I\r\nam still distrustful of myself, and not long ago should hardly have\r\nventured to differ from that Prince of Physicians by so much as a\r\nfinger’s breadth. As for the dividing wall, or septum, between the\r\nventricles forming the right side of the left cavity, the student of\r\nanatomy should consider carefully that it is equally thick, compact, and\r\ndense, with all the rest of the cardiac substance enclosing the left\r\nventricle. And accordingly, notwithstanding what I have said about the\r\npits in this situation, and at the same time not forgetting the\r\nabsorption by the portal vein from the stomach and intestines, I still\r\ndo not see how even the smallest quantity of blood can be transfused,\r\nthrough the substance of the septum, from the right ventricle to the\r\nleft”.\r\n\r\nVesalius and other anatomists knew of the hepatic circulation, or at\r\nleast believed in some communication between the portal and hepatic\r\nveins:—“The branches of this vein”—vena cava—“distributed through the\r\nbody of the liver, come in contact with those of the portal vein; and\r\nthe extreme ramifications of these veins inosculate with each other, and\r\nin many places appear to unite and be continuous”.\r\n\r\nVesalius knew that in several particulars the accepted physiology of the\r\nvascular system was wrong. If he could have lived a few years longer, it\r\nis possible that he might have solved the great problem which was made\r\nclear by William Harvey. In the light of our present knowledge some of\r\nVesalius’s words are suggestive:\r\n\r\n“When these matters are taken into account, many things at once present\r\nthemselves in regard to the arterial system, which deserve careful\r\nconsideration; especially the fact that there is hardly a single vein\r\ngoing to the stomach, the intestines, or even the spleen, without its\r\naccompanying artery, and that nearly every member of the portal system\r\nhas a companion artery associated with it in its course. Again, the\r\narteries going to the kidneys are of such size that they can by no means\r\nbe affirmed to serve merely for regulating the heat of these organs; and\r\nstill less can we assert that so many arteries are distributed to the\r\nstomach, intestines and spleen for that purpose alone. And there is,\r\nfurthermore, the fact, which we must for many reasons admit, that there\r\nis through the arteries and veins a mutual flux and reflux of materials,\r\nand that within these vessels the weight and gravitation of their\r\ncontents has no effect”.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Seventh Book.\r\n\r\nIn the seventh book, consisting of less than sixty pages, Vesalius fully\r\ndescribes the anatomy of the brain, of the cranial nerves, and of the\r\norgans of sense. His description of the eye is not as near accuracy as\r\nmight be expected. He places the crystalline lens in the centre of the\r\nglobe. His description of the organ of vision was only slightly better\r\nthan that which was given by Galen. Vesalius showed, however, that the\r\noptic nerve is not a hollow tube, and that it does not enter the eyeball\r\nexactly in the antero-posterior axis.\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nConsidering the time in which he lived, Vesalius was remarkably free\r\nfrom errors. Although to him the arteries were carriers of vital\r\nspirits, the veins were the true blood vessels, and, according to the\r\nfirst edition of his great book, the septum of the heart was filled with\r\nforamina; yet, we must say with Baas, “these are all mere shadows\r\nnecessary to the brilliancy of the picture”.\r\n\r\nVesalius was more than an anatomist. As a practical physician he had the\r\nhighest reputation among his contemporaries. He was an accomplished\r\nscholar and was thoroughly conversant with the weaknesses of human\r\nnature, as is evident from many satirical touches in his writings.\r\nAlthough his great work contains many errors that a tyro of the present\r\nday would laugh at, it laid the foundations of our knowledge. Vesalius\r\noverthrew the idol of authority in anatomy and taught us to look at\r\nNature with our own eyes.\r\n\r\nPortal[24] has paid a splendid tribute to Vesalius. “Vesalius”, he says,\r\n“appears to me one of the greatest men who ever existed. Let the\r\nastronomers vaunt their Copernicus, the natural philosophers their\r\nGalileo and Torricelli, the mathematicians their Pascal, the geographers\r\ntheir Columbus, I shall always place Vesalius above all their heroes.\r\nThe first study of man is man. Vesalius has this noble object in view,\r\nand has admirably attained it; he has made on himself and his fellows\r\nsuch discoveries as Columbus could make only by travelling to the\r\nextremity of the world. The discoveries of Vesalius are of direct\r\nimportance to man; by acquiring fresh knowledge of his own structure,\r\nman seems to enlarge his existence; while discoveries in geography or\r\nastronomy affect him but in a very indirect manner”.\r\n\r\nLike Harvey, Vesalius was obliged to defend his writings from fierce\r\nattacks. The most desperate of his opponents was his old master, Jacobus\r\nSylvius, who was so wedded to the Galenic teachings that he asserted\r\nthat since Galen’s time the thigh bones had changed their shape. He\r\nspoke of Vesalius as a “madman, Vesanus, whose pestilential breath\r\npoisons Europe”. Ponderous discussions were carried on between the\r\nfriends and opponents of the great anatomist. The complete overthrow of\r\nthe Galenists resulted.\r\n\r\nIf Vesalius had remained professor of anatomy in Padua, instead of being\r\nappointed physician to Charles the Fifth, at Madrid, in 1544, it is\r\nprobable that the circulation of the blood would have been discovered by\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIn recent years attempts have been made to show that it was not\r\nVesalius, but Leonardo da Vinci, who was the founder of modern anatomy.\r\nA considerable amount of controversial literature has accumulated on\r\nthis subject. For our purpose it may suffice to quote the conclusions of\r\nMcMurrich[25]:—“Leonardo was the first to create a new anatomy, but he\r\ncreated it for himself alone; Vesalius demonstrated a new anatomy to the\r\nworld. It was the publication of Vesalius’s _Fabrica_ that\r\nrevolutionized anatomy, while Leonardo’s drawings were lying\r\nunpublished, at first the cherished possessions of his favorite pupil\r\nMelzi, later in the Ambrosian Library in Milan, and still later\r\nforgotten in the Royal Library at Windsor. We must credit Leonardo as\r\nbeing the forerunner of the new anatomy, but Vesalius must be recognized\r\nas its founder”.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: INITIAL LETTER BY VESALIUS\r\n    (From the “Fabrica”, 1543)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER TWELFTH\r\n                        Contemporary Anatomists\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Illuminated capital]\r\n\r\nShortly after the publication of the _Fabrica_, great activity was\r\nmanifested in anatomic research, and numerous opponents and critics of\r\nVesalius appeared in the arena of science. The criticism of such men as\r\nJacobus Sylvius and John Dryander, while it was of a violent type, was\r\nof much less importance than was that of Eustachius, Columbus and\r\nFallopius. Vesalius was not without his partisans, of whom Ingrassias\r\nand Cannanus are worthy of mention.\r\n\r\n\r\nBartholomeus Eustachius\r\n\r\nEustachius was born at San Severino, a small city near Salernum, about\r\nthe year 1520. He studied anatomy in Rome and made remarkable progress\r\nin this science. In the year 1562, as he informs us in his _Opuscula\r\nAnatomica_, he was professor of medicine in the Collegio della Sapienza\r\nat Rome. Like many other men of genius, Eustachius died in poverty. In\r\nAugust, 1574, having been called by the illness of Cardinal Rovere to\r\nFossombrone, Eustachius died upon the journey.\r\n\r\nTo Eustachius posterity is indebted for a series of splendid copperplate\r\nengravings which were designed to illustrate the anatomy of the human\r\nbody. These plates, the handiwork of Eustachius, and the first\r\nanatomical illustrations wrought in copper, were completed in 1552, only\r\nnine years after the first impression of the book of Vesalius.\r\nUnfortunately for himself, and worse for medical science, Eustachius was\r\nunable to publish them. If this magnificent atlas of anatomy could have\r\nbeen published when completed, the anatomical discoveries of the\r\neighteenth century would have come two hundred years earlier.\r\nUnfortunately the entire text of the work is lost. For one hundred and\r\nthirty-eight years the Eustachian plates remained either in the family\r\nof Pinus, an intimate friend of the anatomist, or were buried in the\r\nPapal Library at Rome. When discovered they were presented by Pope\r\nClement XI. to his physician, Lancisi, who published them with notes of\r\nhis own, at Rome, in 1714. In 1740 they were issued under the direction\r\nof Cajetan Petrioli. Four years later the edition by Albinus appeared,\r\nwhich was republished in 1761. The anatomical writings of Eustachius\r\nwere published during his lifetime, in 1564. It is upon his _Tabulae\r\nAnatomicae_ that the fame of this wonderful man is founded. If this work\r\nhad been published in 1552, Eustachius would have divided with Vesalius\r\nthe honor of founding human anatomy. The victim of circumstances, his\r\nname has been overshadowed by that of Vesalius, to whom in some respects\r\nhe was superior. Deprived during life of his merited honors, Eustachius\r\nhas been awarded a goodly share of posthumous fame.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: BRAIN AND NERVES BY EUSTACHIUS\r\n    (Reduced one-half)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: MUSCLES BY EUSTACHIUS\r\n    (Reduced one-half)]\r\n\r\nEustachius was the first anatomist to describe, with any degree of\r\naccuracy, the tube which bears his name. We can truly say he discovered\r\nit, since Alcmaeon dissected only the lower animals, and was not an\r\naccurate observer, as his view that goats breathe through the ears,\r\namply testifies. Eustachius discovered the tensor tympani and stapedius\r\nmuscles, the modiolus and membranous cochlea, and the stapes. The honor\r\nof the discovery of the stapes is claimed for no less than five renowned\r\nanatomists, namely, Fallopius, Ingrassias, Columbus, Colladus, and\r\nEustachius. It is unnecessary to discuss this disputed claim to\r\npriority. The truth seems to be that the stapes was discovered by both\r\nIngrassias and Eustachius, each independently of the other. In 1546\r\nIngrassias publicly demonstrated the little bone of the ear in his\r\nlectures at Naples. Fallopius, after learning from an eyewitness that\r\nIngrassias had actually discovered and named the ossicle, relinquished\r\nhis claim to the discovery. Columbus and Colladus filed their\r\ninformation at too late a date. Eustachius, as previously stated,\r\nfinished his anatomical plates in 1552. His seventh plate shows, among\r\nother subjects, the auditory ossicles—malleus, incus and stapes—and\r\ntensor tympani muscle. These objects are delineated as taken from a\r\nhuman subject, and also from a dog.\r\n\r\nEustachius discovered the origin of the optic nerves, and the sixth\r\ncerebral nerves. He gives excellent pictures of the corpora olivaria and\r\ncorpora pyramidalia; of the stylo-hyoid muscle; of the deep muscles of\r\nthe neck and throat; of the suprarenal capsules, and of the thoracic\r\nduct. He also described the ciliary muscle. Eustachius was the first\r\nanatomist who accurately studied the teeth and the phenomena of the\r\nfirst and second dentition. In his researches he employed magnifying\r\nglasses, maceration, exsiccation, and various methods of injection.\r\n\r\n\r\nRealdus Columbus\r\n\r\nThe first anatomical treatise containing an account of the lesser, or\r\npulmonary circulation, was the monumental work, _De Re Anatomica, libri\r\nxv._, written by Realdus Columbus and sumptuously published at Venice in\r\nthe year 1559. This, however, was not the first printed account of the\r\nlesser circulation. Six years prior to the publication of the book of\r\nColumbus, the unfortunate Servetus, in a theological treatise, described\r\ncorrectly the course of the blood in its transit through the lungs.\r\nTried for heresy, Servetus was burned, together with all obtainable\r\ncopies of his book. Although it had been printed, the work was\r\nsuppressed; hence it follows that Columbus was the first to publish the\r\ngreat discovery. Of the life of this anatomist we know but little. Born\r\nat Cremona, a small Milanese village, the year of his birth is unknown.\r\nHe died in 1559, while his book was being printed. A few copies were\r\nfinished before his demise, since a copy belonging to the late Dr.\r\nGeorge Jackson Fisher, of Sing Sing, N.Y., contains the author’s own\r\ndedication to Pope Paul IV., while in other exemplars, the dedication\r\nhas been written by the two sons of Columbus, and is addressed to “_Pio\r\nIIII., Pont. Max_”. This prelate, on the death of Paul IV., on August\r\n18, 1559, became the head of the Church.\r\n\r\nSome writers have held that the discovery of the lesser circulation was\r\nnot made by Columbus independently of Servetus, but that a copy of the\r\nbook of Servetus had drifted into Italy and had been read by Columbus.\r\nThere is no direct evidence to support this view. When Vesalius was\r\ncalled to Madrid as physician to Charles the Fifth, Columbus, in 1544,\r\nsucceeded him in the University of Padua; two years later he filled the\r\nanatomical chair at Pisa, and in 1546, Pope Paul IV. called him to Rome.\r\nHere he spent the later years of his life, engaged in teaching anatomy\r\nand in writing his book. For forty years Columbus pursued his anatomical\r\nstudies, and in that period he dissected an unusually large number of\r\nbodies. Fourteen subjects passed under his scalpel in a single year.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: TITLE-PAGE OF COLUMBUS’S ANATOMY\r\n    (Reduced one-half)]\r\n\r\nColumbus frequently made experiments upon living animals. He was the\r\nfirst to use dogs for such purposes, preferring them to swine. Book\r\nXIIII. of the work of Columbus is upon the subject of vivisection, _De\r\nviva sectione_. In this he tells us how to employ living dogs in\r\ndemonstrating the movements of the heart and brain, the action of the\r\nlungs, etc. Columbus was the first anatomist who demonstrated\r\nexperimentally that the blood passes from the lungs into the pulmonary\r\nveins. “When the heart dilates”, says Columbus, “it draws natural blood\r\nfrom the vena cava into the right ventricle, and prepared blood from the\r\npulmonary vein into the left; the valves being so disposed that they\r\ncollapse and permit its ingress; but when the heart contracts, they\r\nbecome tense, and close the apertures, so that nothing can return by the\r\nway it came. The valves of the aorta and pulmonary artery opening, on\r\nthe contrary, at the same moment, give passage to the spirituous blood\r\nfor distribution to the body at large, and to the natural blood for\r\ntransference to the lungs”.\r\n\r\nLike Servetus, Columbus held to the idea of “spiritus”. Harvey was the\r\nfirst physiologist who recognized the circulation as purely a movement\r\nof blood. All before him assumed the existence of a mixture of air and\r\nblood. Columbus, pupil and prosector of Vesalius, like his great master,\r\ndenied the existence of foramina in the cardiac septum.\r\n\r\n\r\nGabriel Fallopius\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: GABRIEL FALLOPIUS]\r\n\r\nGabriel Fallopius (1523-1562), of Modena, was a noted Italian anatomist.\r\nIn his twenty-fifth year he was made professor of anatomy at Pisa.\r\nAlthough the span of his life was short, he will be remembered always as\r\nthe discoverer of the tubes which bear his name. According to Fisher,\r\nFallopius “described the ear more minutely than had ever before been\r\ndone. He discovered the little canal along which the facial nerve passes\r\nafter leaving the auditory; it is still called the _aquaeductus\r\nFallopii_. He demonstrated the fact of the communication of the mastoid\r\ncells with the cavity of the tympanum; and also described the fenestrae\r\nrotunda and ovalis. In the treatment of diseases of the ear, he used an\r\naural speculum, and employed sulphuric acid for the removal of polypi\r\nfrom the meatus. In some of his supposed discoveries he had long been\r\nanticipated; for example, the tubes which bear his name were known and\r\naccurately described by Herophilus, over three hundred years before the\r\nChristian era, and also by Rufus of Ephesus, of whom Galen speaks as the\r\nbest anatomist of the second century. Rufus refers to two varicose and\r\ntortuous vessels passing from the testes (as the ovaries were called) to\r\nthe cavity of the uterus. Fallopius, however, gave a full account of\r\ntheir course, position, size and structure. He cut into them and found\r\nthem hollow, gave them the name of tubae seminales, and posterity\r\nattached his name to them, and in time came to a better comprehension of\r\ntheir true function. This is not the only instance in the history of\r\nanatomical discovery where the name of a person, not its discoverer, has\r\nbeen given to an organ. Allusion has been made to Fallopius as a\r\nbotanist; a genus of plants, _Fallopia_, has been named in honor of\r\nhim”.\r\n\r\nFallopius was appointed professor of anatomy at Pisa, in the year 1548;\r\nand later, at the instance of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, Cosimo I., he\r\nreceived a professorship at Padua, as successor to Vesalius. Besides the\r\nchair of anatomy and surgery and of botany, he also held the office of\r\nsuperintendent of the new botanic garden in that city. Fallopius\r\nremained in Padua to the day of his death, which occurred in 1562. He\r\nwas very properly succeeded by his favorite pupil, Fabricius ab\r\nAquapendente, who had been for some time previously his anatomical\r\ndemonstrator. His collected works, as published in Venice, 1606, embrace\r\ntwenty-four treatises distributed in three folio volumes. Only one of\r\nhis works was published during his lifetime, namely, his _Observationes\r\nAnatomicae_, Venice, 1561, which is considered one of his most valuable\r\nbooks, containing, as it does, most of his discoveries and his\r\nanimadversions on the works of other anatomists.\r\n\r\nThis was written as a supplement to the anatomy of Vesalius, for it\r\nfollows the same order, passes upon the same subjects, corrects the\r\ninaccuracies of the Vesalian treatise, and supplies what is wanting.\r\nThroughout the work Fallopius treats Vesalius with great respect, and\r\nnever mentions him without an honorable title. Vesalius wrote an answer\r\nto this work, entitled, _Observationum Fallopii examen_, in which he\r\nacknowledges the courtesy of Fallopius, but, as argument progresses,\r\nappears to be out of temper.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Fallopius it was thought that no successor except\r\nVesalius could be found competent to fill his place. Accordingly\r\nVesalius was chosen. The news of his appointment reached him while he\r\nwas returning from a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. Unfortunately he was\r\nshipwrecked and perished, otherwise history would have afforded an\r\nexample of the master filling the chair of the pupil.\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Philip Ingrassias\r\n\r\nIngrassias, who lived between the years 1510-1580, was a graduate of the\r\ncelebrated Paduan School. He described minutely the anatomy of the ear,\r\nincluding the tympanum, fenestrae rotunda and ovalis, the cochlea, the\r\nsemi-circular canals, and the tensor tympani muscle. His admiring pupils\r\ncaused his portrait to be painted and placed in the Neapolitan School,\r\nwith this inscription:—“To Philip Ingrassias, of Sicily, who, by his\r\nlectures, restored the science of true Medicine and Anatomy in Naples,\r\nhis pupils have suspended this portrait as a mark of grateful\r\nremembrance”. Ingrassias was a voluminous writer, his chief work being a\r\ntreatise on osteology, which was published twenty-three years after his\r\ndeath. When the plague depopulated Palermo, in 1575, his devotion was\r\nsuch as to earn for him the title of the Sicilian Hippocrates. Few men\r\nhave been more earnest workers in medical science. If his fame as an\r\nanatomist has not equalled that of others, the cause is to be sought in\r\nthe multiplicity of competitors, not in lack of zeal and ability.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: INGRASSIAS]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER THIRTEENTH\r\n                      Commentators and Plagiarists\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Illuminated capital]\r\n\r\nMedical history furnishes numerous examples of literary theft. In many\r\ninstances an entire set of anatomical plates has been pirated by\r\nunscrupulous publishers. In a few cases both text and plates have been\r\nappropriated by medical authors. The most notorious example of this form\r\nof theft was furnished by William Cowper (1666-1709), an English surgeon\r\nand anatomist, who, having secured three hundred copies of Bidloo’s set\r\nof one hundred and five anatomical plates, in 1697 issued the work[26]\r\nas his own. Cowper added a few original illustrations to the book.\r\n\r\nVesalius suffered severely at the hands of the plagiarists. Pirated\r\neditions of the _Tabulae Anatomicae_ were printed in several cities,\r\nchiefly in Germany. As regards the _Fabrica_, we may say that it has\r\nbeen the fountain from which many anatomical writers have derived\r\npractically all of their illustrations and much of their text.\r\n\r\nThe fame of the _Fabrica_ soon spread throughout Europe. It was\r\npublished in Germany, in Holland and in England. An epitome of its\r\ncontents was issued in Latin, in 1545, by Thomas Geminus, or Gemini,\r\nunder the title:—_Compendiosa totius Anatomiae delineatio, aere exaratum\r\nper Thomam. Geminum._ It contained forty of the Vesalian plates, cut in\r\ncopper, and was the first book issued in England in which the roller\r\nprinting process was employed. It was dedicated to Henry the Eighth, and\r\nwas embellished with “one of the earliest and most curious of all extant\r\nengraved title-pages”.\r\n\r\nIn 1553, Geminus issued a second edition, in which the text was\r\ntranslated into English. This edition was dedicated to Edward the Sixth,\r\nwith a commendatory note, “To the gentill readers and Surgeons of\r\nEnglande”. Six years later the third English edition appeared, which was\r\ninscribed to Queen Elizabeth. It contains the first published portrait\r\nof the Queen. She is shown upon the engraved title-page, and, strange to\r\nsay, above her is another queenly figure, with a pen in her right hand,\r\na wreath on her left, her foot resting on the globe, and styled\r\n_Victoria_.\r\n\r\nAnother English work on anatomy, which is filled with poor imitations of\r\nVesalius’s illustrations, is the _Microcosmographia_ of Helkiah Crooke,\r\nor Crocus, who was “Professor in Anatomy and Chirurgery”. Its chief\r\nvalue rests in an elaborately engraved title-page, a part of which shows\r\nCrooke giving a demonstration in anatomy in the presence of the\r\n“Worshipfull Company of Barber-Chirurgeons”, in London, early in the\r\nseventeenth century.\r\n\r\nJohn Banister of Nottingham, in 1578, borrowed a few Vesalian woodcuts\r\nfor use in _The Historie of Man, sucked from the sappe of the most\r\napproved Anatomists and published for the Utilitie of all Godly\r\nChirurgians within this Realme_.\r\n\r\nMost of the host of translators, epitomizers, commentators and imitators\r\nof Vesalius have passed into oblivion. A few of these persons have\r\npossessed enough of individuality to deserve recognition.\r\n\r\nJuan Valverde di Hamusco, a Spaniard who was born about the year 1500,\r\nstudied anatomy at Padua and later at Rome. His book, _Historia de la\r\nComposicion del Cuerpo Humano_, was published at Rome in 1556. It\r\ncontains forty-two copperplates and an engraved title-page. Although the\r\nauthor says he has used only the Vesalian plates, his work contains\r\nseveral plates which are not to be found in Vesalius’s writings. For\r\nexample, Valverde shows a _muskelmann_ with his skin held in his right\r\nhand, the left grasping a dagger which may have been used in the\r\nskinning process. Other original drawings show the abdomen and\r\nintestines, a pregnant woman with the abdomen opened, and illustrations\r\nof the superficial veins.\r\n\r\nValverde was physician to Cardinal Juan de Toledo, Archbishop of\r\nSantiago, to whom the work is dedicated. The illustrations were drawn by\r\nGaspar Becerra and were engraved by Nicholas Beatrizet. Valverde’s book\r\nwent through several editions. It forms a landmark in the medical\r\nhistory of Spain—a country which, for many years, was behind other\r\nstates of Europe in matters of science.\r\n\r\nTo name the list of anatomical writers who have derived their artistic\r\ninspiration from the _Fabrica_ would require much more space than is at\r\nour disposal. It must suffice to say, that, for a period of two\r\ncenturies, nearly all treatises on anatomy contained illustrations which\r\nwere taken from the writings of Vesalius. With few exceptions, these\r\nreproductions were little better than caricatures of the original\r\nfigures.\r\n\r\nOf the numerous editions of the _Fabrica_ there are three which are\r\nhighly prized, namely, the first one, 1543; the second, issued in 1555,\r\ncontaining eight hundred and twenty-four pages, with many changes in the\r\ntext; and the 1725 edition of the collected writings of Vesalius. The\r\nlast named is a huge volume which was published at Leyden under the\r\nsupervision of Boerhaave and Albinus, with the illustrations cut in\r\ncopper by Jan Wandelaar[27].\r\n\r\nIt contains the _Fabrica_, the _Epitome_, the _Epistola de Radicis\r\nChynae_, various anatomical treatises of a controversial character, and\r\nthe _Chirurgia Magna_ which has been wrongly attributed to Vesalius.\r\nMorley says of this book:—“After his death a great work on surgery\r\nappeared, in seven books, signed with his name, and commonly included\r\namong his writings. There is reason, however, to believe that his name\r\nwas stolen to give value to the book, which was compiled and published\r\nby a Venetian, Prosper Bogarucci, a literary crow, who fed himself upon\r\nthe dead man’s reputation”.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Ornamental block]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER FOURTEENTH\r\n                          The Court Physician\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Illuminated capital]\r\n\r\nVesalius, having finished the _Fabrica_, intended to write a work on the\r\npractice of medicine which should be based on pathology. He makes\r\nmention of this in the preface of the _Fabrica_, and in numerous places\r\nin the body of the book he describes the pathologic appearances which he\r\nfound in dissection.\r\n\r\nReturning to Padua after a year’s absence, he found that the University\r\nfor which he had strenuously labored was a very hotbed of opposition.\r\nHis former pupil and friend, Realdus Columbus, who was now lecturing on\r\nanatomy at Padua, had turned against him. How deeply Vesalius was\r\nwounded by the man whom he had made, can be appreciated only by those\r\nwho have been placed in similar circumstances. The controversy between\r\nColumbus and Vesalius was of a bitter and personal character.\r\n\r\nOn all sides the views of Vesalius were attacked, and the defenders of\r\nGalen joined hands with men like Columbus in an effort to besmirch the\r\ngreat anatomist. Disgusted with such treatment, Vesalius, early in 1544,\r\nwent to Pisa. Here he conducted a course in anatomy. Leaving Pisa, he\r\nwent to Bologna where he made some special dissections upon two bodies.\r\nAbout this time he declined a chair in the University of Pisa which was\r\ntendered to him by direction of Cosimo de’ Medici. Tired of the\r\napparently useless effort to make men see the truth, sick of disputes\r\nand arguments, persecuted by members of his own profession, in a fit of\r\npassion Vesalius threw his manuscripts into the fire and ended his\r\ncareer as a scientist. “Thus”, says Morley, “he destroyed a huge volume\r\nof annotations upon Galen; a whole book of Medical Formulae; many\r\noriginal notes upon drugs; the copy of Galen from which he lectured,\r\ncovered with marginal notes of new observations that had occurred to him\r\nwhile demonstrating; and the paraphrase of the books of Rhazes, in which\r\nthe knowledge of the Arabians was collated with that of the Greeks and\r\nothers”.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: CHARLES THE FIFTH]\r\n\r\nWhile in this frame of mind it is not surprising that he should have\r\naccepted the appointment of Archiatrus to Charles the Fifth of Spain.\r\n\r\nThe great Emperor was now at the zenith of his fame. His kingdom, which\r\nreached from South America to the Zuyder Zee, was well under control,\r\nbut the monarch already contemplated the abdication of the throne in\r\nfavor of his son Philip, who is known in history as Philip the Second.\r\n\r\nVesalius left Italy and took up his residence at Madrid. He was now in\r\nhis thirtieth year. As Archiatrus he accompanied the Emperor in the\r\nfourth French war, in which he gained his first experience as a military\r\nsurgeon. He also acted as physician to Charles and to the members of the\r\nimperial household. The war ended in September 1544. In January, 1545,\r\nCharles went to Brussels, and remained in the Netherlands for many\r\nmonths. Vesalius was now in his native country, and in April, 1546, he\r\nvisited the graves of his ancestors at Nymwegen and Wesel. In the same\r\nyear he published a new edition of his treatise on the China root.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-fifth day of October, 1555, amid a scene of pomp and\r\nsplendor, in the presence of the assembled representatives of the\r\nNetherlands, Charles formally surrendered to his son all his\r\nterritories, jurisdiction and authority in the Low-Countries. This was\r\nthe first of a series of acts by which the Emperor gradually\r\nrelinquished the reins of power, in order to spend his remaining days in\r\na cloister. Philip thus became the heir to a vast dominion. Vesalius was\r\ncontinued in office as Archiatrus by the new Emperor. From both Charles\r\nand Philip, Vesalius received many marks of honor. It was he who rescued\r\nCharles from what was thought to be a mortal disease. At a later date,\r\nwhen Philip’s unfortunate son, Don Carlos, received a severe injury to\r\nthe head, and after the treatment of the Spanish physicians had failed,\r\nit was Vesalius who saved his life by an operation. These cures, and the\r\naccurate prediction of the death-day of Maximilian d’Egmont, placed the\r\nfame of Vesalius at high tide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER FIFTEENTH\r\n                          Pilgrimage and Death\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Illuminated capital]\r\n\r\nSuddenly, early in the year 1564, for a reason which has never been\r\nexplained satisfactorily, Vesalius left Madrid. Apparently he was at the\r\nheight of success. He was famous as a physician and surgeon; he was a\r\nfavorite at the Spanish court; he had amassed a fortune; and seemingly\r\nhe was destined to pass his remaining days under the most favorable\r\nsurroundings. As occurs to all great men, he had excited the jealous\r\nanimosity of many of the members of his profession. The efforts of the\r\nMadrid physicians to ignore the talents of one whom they regarded as a\r\nforeigner, long since had reacted to the advantage of the Archiatrus.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PHILIP THE SECOND]\r\n\r\nDuring the twenty years that he had filled the post of Archiatrus, the\r\nscalpel of Vesalius was rusting: but the controversy concerning the\r\ninfallibility of Galen was still raging. The violent criticisms of\r\nSylvius upon the _Fabrica_ had been silenced by death, but others took\r\nup the cause of Galen where Sylvius had left it. But the passing years\r\nhad brought a new coterie of professors, who, like Fallopius at Padua;\r\nRondelet at Montpellier; Massa at Venice; and Fuchs at Tübingen, were\r\nboldly teaching many things that were contrary to Galen.\r\n\r\nLife at the Spanish court was not favorable to the study of science.\r\n“The hand of the Church”, says Foster[28], “was heavy on the land; the\r\ndagger of the Inquisition was stabbing at all mental life, and its torch\r\nwas a sterilizing flame sweeping over all intellectual activity. The\r\npursuit of natural knowledge had become a crime, and to search with the\r\nscalpel into the secrets of the body of man was accounted sacrilege. It\r\nwas for a life in priest-ridden, ignorant, superstitious Madrid that\r\nVesalius had forsaken the freedom of the Venetian Republic and the\r\nbright academic circles of Padua; in Madrid, where, as he himself has\r\nsaid, ‘he could not lay his hand on so much as a dried skull, much less\r\nhave the chance of making a dissection’. Moreover, he must have felt the\r\nloss of Charles, who, whatever his faults, recognized the worth of\r\nintellectual efforts, and in many ways had shown his sympathy with\r\nVesalius’s love of knowledge. Such sympathy could not be looked for in\r\nthe narrow and bigoted Philip”.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Vesalius received a copy of the _Observationes\r\nAnatomicae_ of his pupil Fallopius, who, having learned all that his\r\nmaster had taught of anatomy, continued his studies with great skill and\r\nindustry. Such a book, coming at an opportune time, must have seemed\r\nlike a voice calling the Archiatrus back to the intellectual life,\r\nbringing to his mind’s eye the recollection of his happy days in Italy.\r\n\r\nVesalius travelled to Venice by way of Perpignan. While in Venice he\r\nvisited the printer, Francesco Sanese, and discussed the publication of\r\na new book which should contain his reply to Fallopius. In a short time\r\nhe started for Cyprus in company with Jacobo Malatesta, the commander of\r\nthe Venetian forces in that island. Thence he passed to Jerusalem on a\r\npilgrimage to the Holy Land. Vesalius never returned from that journey.\r\nInformation of his death reached Brussels towards the end of that\r\nyear—1564.\r\n\r\nWhat was the reason for this pilgrimage? Various alleged authorities\r\nhave given different versions, many of which are evidently fictitious.\r\nThe most reasonable account, which emanates from Spanish-French sources,\r\ndates from a letter written January 1, 1565, to the physician Caspar\r\nPeucer by Hubert Languer, or Hubertus Languetus, the Huguenot friend of\r\nPhilip Sidney, which says:—“They say that Vesalius is dead. Doubtless\r\nyou have heard that he went to Jerusalem. That journey had, as they tell\r\nus from Spain, an odd reason. Vesalius, believing a young Spanish\r\nnobleman whom he had attended to be dead, obtained leave of the parents\r\nto open the body for the sake of inquiring into the cause of the\r\nillness, which he had not rightly comprehended. This was granted; but he\r\nhad no sooner made an incision into the body than he perceived the\r\nsymptoms of life, and opening the breast, saw the heart beat. The\r\nparents coming afterwards to the knowledge of this, were not satisfied\r\nwith prosecuting him for murder, but accused him to the Inquisition of\r\nimpiety, in hopes that he would be punished with greater rigor by the\r\njudges of that tribunal than by those of the common law. But the King of\r\nSpain interposed, and saved him on condition that by way of atoning for\r\nthe error he should undertake a pilgrimage to the Holy Land”.\r\n\r\nThe pilgrimage was made, the Holy Sepulcher was visited, and the weary\r\nwanderer had started for Padua to take the chair which was made vacant\r\nby the death of Fallopius. A violent storm swept the Ionian Sea.\r\nVesalius’s ship was wrecked upon the island of Zakynthos, where, on the\r\nfifteenth day of October, 1564, the Archiatrus died of exhaustion.\r\n\r\nSuch was the miserable end of Andreas Vesalius of Brussels, a man, who,\r\nbefore he had attained his thirtieth year, had become the greatest\r\nanatomist that the world has ever seen.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Ornamental block]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               FOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Théorie de la figure humaine.
